But for the Kingmaker, the man who for ten\r\nyears was the first subject of the English Crown, and whose figure\r\nlooms out with a vague grandeur even through the misty annals of the\r\nWars of the Roses, no writer has spared a monograph. Every one, it is\r\ntrue, knows his name, but his personal identity is quite ungrasped.\r\nNine persons out of ten if asked to sketch his character would find, to\r\ntheir own surprise, that they were falling back for their information\r\nto Lord Lytton's _Last of the Barons_ or Shakespeare's _Henry the\r\nSixth_.\r\n\r\nAn attempt, therefore, even an inadequate attempt, to trace out\r\nwith accuracy his career and his habits of mind from the original\r\nauthorities cannot fail to be of some use to the general reader as well\r\nas to the student of history. The result will perhaps appear meagre\r\nto those who are accustomed to the biographies of the men of later\r\ncenturies. We are curiously ignorant of many of the facts that should\r\naid us to build up a picture of the man. No trustworthy representation\r\nof his bodily form exists. The day of portraits was not yet come; his\r\nmonument in Bisham Abbey has long been swept away; no writer has even\r\ndeigned to describe his personal appearance--we know not if he was dark\r\nor fair, stout or slim. At most we may gather from the vague phrases\r\nof the chroniclers, and from his quaint armed figure in the Rous Roll,\r\nthat he was of great stature and breadth of limb. But perhaps the good\r\nRous was thinking of his fame rather than his body, when he sketched\r\nthe Earl in that quaint pictorial pedigree over-topping all his race\r\nsave his cousin and king and enemy, Edward the Fourth.\r\n\r\nBut Warwick has only shared the fate of all his contemporaries. The\r\nmen of the fifteenth century are far less well known to us than are\r\ntheir grandfathers or their grandsons. In the fourteenth century the\r\nchroniclers were still working on their old scale; in the sixteenth\r\nthe literary spirit had descended on the whole nation, and great men\r\nand small were writing hard at history as at every other branch of\r\nknowledge. But in the days of Lancaster and York the old fountains\r\nhad run dry, and the new flood of the Renaissance had not risen. The\r\nmaterials for reconstructing history are both scanty and hard to\r\nhandle. We dare not swallow Hall and Hollingshead whole, as was the\r\ncustom for two hundred years, or take their annals, coloured from\r\nend to end with Tudor sympathies, as good authority for the doings of\r\nthe previous century. Yet when we have put aside their fascinating,\r\nif somewhat untrustworthy, volumes, we find ourselves wandering in a\r\nvery dreary waste of fragments and scraps of history, strung together\r\non the meagre thread of two or three dry and jejune compilations of\r\nannals. To have to take William of Worcester or good Abbot Whethamsted\r\nas the groundwork of a continuous account of the times is absolutely\r\nmaddening. Hence it comes to pass that Warwick has failed to receive\r\nhis dues.\r\n\r\nOf all the men of Warwick's century there are only two whose characters\r\nwe seem thoroughly to grasp--the best and the worst products of the\r\nage--Henry the Fifth and Richard the Third. The achievements of the one\r\nstirred even the feeble writers of that day into a fulness of detail in\r\nwhich they indulge for no other hero; the other served as the text for\r\nso many invectives under the Tudors that we imagine that we see a real\r\nman in the gloomy portrait that is set up before us. Yet we may fairly\r\nask whether our impression is not drawn, either at first or at second\r\nhand, almost entirely from Sir Thomas More's famous biography of the\r\nusurper, a work whose literary merits have caused it to be received as\r\nthe only serious source for Richard's history. If we had not that work,\r\nRichard of Gloucester would seem a vaguely-defined monster of iniquity,\r\nas great a puzzle to the student of history as are the other shadowy\r\nforms which move on through those evil times to fall, one after the\r\nother, into the bloody grave which was the common lot of all.\r\n\r\nIn spite, however, of the dearth of good chronicles, and of the\r\nabsolute non-existence of any contemporary writers of literary merit,\r\nthere are authorities enough of one sort and another to make it both\r\npossible and profitable to build up a detailed picture of Warwick and\r\nhis times. First and foremost, of course, come the invaluable Paston\r\nLetters, covering the whole period, and often supplying the vivid\r\ntouches of detail in which the more formal documents are so lamentably\r\ndeficient. If but half a dozen families, as constant in letter-writing\r\nas John and Margery Paston, had transmitted their correspondence\r\nto posterity, there would be little need to grumble at our lack of\r\ninformation. Other letters too exist, scattered in collections, such\r\nas the interesting scrawl from Warwick himself, in his dire extremity\r\nbefore Barnet fight, to Henry Vernon, which was turned up a year ago\r\namong the lumber at Belvoir Castle. Much can be gathered from rolls and\r\ninquests--for example, the all-important information as to centres and\r\nsources of local power can be traced out with perfect accuracy from the\r\ncolumns of the Escheats Roll, where each peer or knight's lands are\r\ncarefully set forth at the moment of his decease. Joining one authority\r\nto another, we may fairly build up the England of the fifteenth century\r\nbefore our eyes with some approach to completeness.\r\n\r\nThe whole picture of the times is very depressing on the moral if not\r\non the material side. There are few more pitiful episodes in history\r\nthan the whole tale of the reign of Henry the Sixth, the most unselfish\r\nand well-intentioned king that ever sat upon the English throne--a man\r\nof whom not even his enemies and oppressors could find an evil word to\r\nsay; the troubles came, as they confessed, \"all because of his false\r\nlords, and never of him.\" We feel that there must have been something\r\nwrong with the heart of a nation that could see unmoved the meek and\r\nholy King torn from wife and child, sent to wander in disguise up and\r\ndown the kingdom for which he had done his poor best, and finally\r\ndoomed to pine for five years a prisoner in the fortress where he had\r\nso long held his royal Court. Nor is our first impression concerning\r\nthe demoralisation of England wrong. Every line that we read bears home\r\nto us more and more the fact that the nation had fallen on evil times.\r\nFirst and foremost among the causes of its moral deterioration was\r\nthe wretched French War, a war begun in the pure spirit of greed and\r\nambition,--there was not even the poor excuse that had existed in the\r\ntime of Edward the Third--carried on by the aid of hordes of debauched\r\nforeign mercenaries (after Henry the Fifth's death the native English\r\nseldom formed more than a third of any host that took the field in\r\nFrance), and persisted in long after it had become hopeless, partly\r\nfrom misplaced national pride, partly because of the personal interests\r\nof the ruling classes. Thirty-five years of a war that was as unjust as\r\nit was unfortunate had both soured and demoralised the nation. England\r\nwas full of disbanded soldiers of fortune; of knights who had lost\r\nthe ill-gotten lands across the Channel, where they had maintained a\r\nprecarious lordship in the days of better fortune; of castellans and\r\ngovernors whose occupation was gone; of hangers-on of all sorts who had\r\nonce maintained themselves on the spoils of Normandy and Guienne. Year\r\nafter year men and money had been lavished on the war to no effect;\r\nand when the final catastrophe came, and the fights of Formigny and\r\nChatillon ended the chapter of our disasters, the nation began to\r\ncast about for a scapegoat on whom to lay the burden of its failures.\r\nThe real blame lay on the nation itself, not on any individual; and\r\nthe real fault that had been committed was not the mismanagement of an\r\nenterprise which presented any hopes of success, but a wrong-headed\r\npersistence in an attempt to conquer a country which was too strong\r\nto be held down. However, the majority of the English people chose to\r\nassume firstly that the war with France might have been conducted to\r\na prosperous issue, and secondly that certain particular persons were\r\nresponsible for its having come to the opposite conclusion. At first\r\nthe unfortunate Suffolk and Somerset had the responsibility laid upon\r\nthem. A little later the outcry became more bold and fixed upon the\r\nLancastrian dynasty itself as being to blame not only for disaster\r\nabroad, but for the \"want of governance\" at home. If King Henry had\r\nunderstood the charge, and possessed the wit to answer it, he might\r\nfairly have replied that his subjects must fit the burden upon their\r\nown backs, not upon his. The war had been weakly conducted, it was\r\ntrue; but weakly because the men and money for it were grudged. The\r\nEngland that could put one hundred thousand men into the field in a\r\ncivil broil at Towton sent four thousand to fight the decisive battle\r\nat Formigny that settled our fate in Normandy. At home the bulwarks of\r\nsocial order seemed crumbling away. Private wars, riot, open highway\r\nrobbery, murder, abduction, armed resistance to the law, prevailed on\r\na scale that had been unknown since the troublous times of Edward the\r\nSecond--we might almost say since the evil days of Stephen. But it was\r\nnot the Crown alone that should have been blamed for the state of the\r\nrealm. The nation had chosen to impose over-stringent constitutional\r\nchecks on the kingly power before it was ripe for self-government, and\r\nthe Lancastrian house sat on the throne because it had agreed to submit\r\nto those checks. If the result of the experiment was disastrous, both\r\nparties to the contract had to bear their share of the responsibility.\r\nBut a nation seldom allows that it has been wrong; and Henry of Windsor\r\nhad to serve as scapegoat for all the misfortunes of the realm, because\r\nHenry of Bolingbroke had committed his descendants to the unhappy\r\ncompact.\r\n\r\nWant of a strong central government was undoubtedly the complaint under\r\nwhich England was labouring in the middle of the fifteenth century, and\r\nall the grievances against which outcry was made were but symptoms of\r\none latent disease.\r\n\r\nEver since the death of Henry the Fifth the internal government of\r\nthe country had been steadily going from bad to worse. The mischief\r\nhad begun in the young King's earliest years. The Council of Regency\r\nthat ruled in his name had from the first proved unable to make its\r\nauthority felt as a single individual ruler might have done. With\r\nthe burden of the interminable French War weighing upon their backs,\r\nand the divisions caused by the quarrels of Beaufort and Gloucester\r\ndividing them into factions, the councillors had not enough attention\r\nto spare for home government. As early as 1428 we find them, when\r\nconfronted by the outbreak of a private war in the north, endeavouring\r\nto patch up the quarrel by arbitration, instead of punishing the\r\noffenders on each side. Accounts of riotous assemblages in all parts\r\nof the country, of armed violence at parliamentary elections, of\r\nparty fights in London at Parliament time--like that which won for the\r\nmeeting of 1426 the name of the Parliament of Bats (bludgeons)--grow\r\nmore and more common. We even find treasonable insurrection appearing\r\nin the strange obscure rising of the political Lollards under Jack\r\nSharp in 1431, an incident which shows how England was on the verge of\r\nbloodshed twenty years before the final outbreak of civil war was to\r\ntake place.\r\n\r\nBut all these public troubles would have been of comparatively small\r\nimportance if the heart of the nation had been sound. The phenomenon\r\nwhich makes the time so depressing is the terrible decay in private\r\nmorals since the previous century. A steady deterioration is going\r\non through the whole period, till at its end we find hardly a single\r\nindividual in whom it is possible to interest ourselves, save an\r\noccasional Colet or Caxton, who belongs in spirit, if not date, to the\r\noncoming renascence of the next century. There is no class or caste in\r\nEngland which comes well out of the scrutiny. The Church, which had\r\nserved as the conscience of the nation in better times, had become\r\ndead to spiritual things; it no longer produced either men of saintly\r\nlife or learned theologians or patriotic statesmen. In its corporate\r\ncapacity it had grown inertly orthodox. Destitute of any pretence of\r\nspiritual energy, yet showing a spirit of persecution such as it had\r\nnever displayed in earlier centuries, its sole activity consisted in\r\nhunting to the stake the few men who displayed any symptoms of thinking\r\nfor themselves in matters of religion. So great was the deadness of the\r\nChurch that it was possible to fall into trouble, like Bishop Pecock,\r\nnot for defending Lollardry, but for showing too much originality\r\nin attacking it. Individually the leading churchmen of the day were\r\npoliticians and nothing more, nor were they as a rule politicians of\r\nthe better sort; for one like Beaufort, who was at any rate consistent\r\nand steadfast, there are many Bourchiers and George Nevilles and\r\nBeauchamps, who merely sailed with the wind and intrigued for their own\r\nfortunes or those of their families.\r\n\r\nOf the English baronage of the fifteenth century we shall have\r\nso much to say in future chapters that we need not here enlarge\r\non its characteristics. Grown too few and too powerful, divided\r\ninto a few rival groups, whose political attitude was settled by a\r\nconsideration of family grudges and interests rather than by any\r\ngrounds of principle, or patriotism, or loyalty, they were as unlike\r\ntheir ancestors of the days of John or Edward the First as their\r\necclesiastical contemporaries were unlike Langton or even Winchelsey.\r\nThe baronage of England had often been unruly, but it had never before\r\ndeveloped the two vices which distinguished it in the times of the\r\nTwo Roses--a taste for indiscriminate bloodshed and a turn for rapid\r\npolitical apostasy. To put prisoners to death by torture as did Tiptoft\r\nEarl of Worcester, to desert to the enemy in the midst of battle\r\nlike Lord Grey de Ruthyn at Northampton, or Stanley at Bosworth, had\r\nnever before been the custom of England. It is impossible not to\r\nrecognise in such traits the results of the French War. Twenty years\r\nspent in contact with French factions, and in command of the godless\r\nmercenaries who formed the bulk of the English armies, had taught our\r\nnobles lessons of cruelty and faithlessness such as they had not before\r\nimbibed. Their demoralisation had been displayed in France long ere\r\nthe outbreak of civil war caused it to manifest itself at home.\r\n\r\nBut if the Church was effete and the baronage demoralised, it might\r\nhave been thought that England should have found salvation in the\r\nsoundheartedness of her gentry and her burgesses. Unfortunately such\r\nwas not to be the case. Both of these classes were growing in strength\r\nand importance during the century, but when the times of trouble came\r\nthey gave no signs of aspiring to direct the destinies of the nation.\r\nThe House of Commons which should, as representing those classes, have\r\ngone on developing its privileges, was, on the contrary, thrice as\r\nimportant in the reign of Henry the Fourth as in that of Edward the\r\nFourth. The knights and squires showed on a smaller scale all of the\r\nvices of the nobility. Instead of holding together and maintaining a\r\nunited loyalty to the Crown, they bound themselves by solemn sealed\r\nbonds and the reception of \"liveries\" each to the baron whom he\r\npreferred. This fatal system, by which the smaller landholder agreed on\r\nbehalf of himself and his tenants to follow his greater neighbour in\r\npeace and war, had ruined the military system of England, and was quite\r\nas dangerous as the ancient feudalism. The salutary old usage, by which\r\nall freemen who were not tenants of a lord served under the sheriff in\r\nwar, and not under the banner of any of the baronage, had long been\r\nforgotten. Now, if all the gentry of a county were bound by these\r\nvoluntary indentures to serve some great lord, there was no national\r\nforce in that county on which the Crown could count, for the yeoman\r\nfollowed the knight as the knight followed the baron. If the gentry\r\nconstituted themselves the voluntary followers of the baronage, and\r\naided their employers to keep England unhappy, the class of citizens\r\nand burgesses took a very different line of conduct. If not actively\r\nmischievous, they were sordidly inert. They refused to entangle\r\nthemselves in politics at all. They submitted impassively to each ruler\r\nin turn, when they had ascertained that their own persons and property\r\nwere not endangered by so doing. A town, it has been remarked, seldom\r\nor never stood a siege during the Wars of the Roses, for no town ever\r\nrefused to open its gates to any commander with an adequate force who\r\nasked for entrance. If we find a few exceptions to the rule, we almost\r\nalways learn that entrance was denied not by the citizens, but by some\r\ngarrison of the opposite side which was already within the walls.\r\nLoyalty seems to have been as wanting among the citizens as among the\r\nbarons of England. If they generally showed some slight preference for\r\nYork rather than for Lancaster, it was not on any moral or sentimental\r\nground, but because the house of Lancaster was known by experience\r\nto be weak in enforcing \"good governance,\" and the house of York was\r\npledged to restore the strength of the Crown and to secure better times\r\nfor trade than its rival.\r\n\r\nWarwick was a strong man, born at the commencement of Henry the\r\nSixth's unhappy minority, whose coming of age coincided with the\r\noutburst of national rage caused by the end of the disastrous French\r\nWar, whose birth placed him at the head of one of the great factions\r\nin the nobility, whose strength of body and mind enabled him to turn\r\nthat headship to full account. How he dealt with the problems which\r\ninevitable necessity laid before him we shall endeavour to relate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE OF NEVILLE\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the great houses of mediæval England, the Nevilles of Raby were\r\nincontestably the toughest and the most prolific. From the reign of\r\nJohn to the reign of Elizabeth their heritage never once passed into\r\nthe female line, and in all the fourteen generations which lived and\r\ndied between 1210 and 1600 there was only one occasion on which the\r\nsuccession passed from uncle to nephew, and not from father to son or\r\ngrandson. The vitality of the Neville tribe was sufficient to bear them\r\nthrough repeated marriages with those only daughters and heiresses\r\nwhose wedlock so often forebodes the extinction of an ancient house. Of\r\nfour successive heads of the family between 1250 and 1350, all married\r\nladies who were the last representatives of old baronial houses; but\r\nthe Nevilles only grew more numerous, and spread into more and more\r\nbranches, extending their possessions farther and farther from their\r\noriginal seat on the Durham moors till all the counties of the north\r\nwere full of their manors.\r\n\r\nThe original source of the family was a certain Robert Fitz-Maldred,\r\nlord of Raby, who, in the reign of John, married Isabella de Neville,\r\nheiress of his neighbour Geoffrey de Neville of Brancepeth. Robert's\r\nson Geoffrey, who united the Teesdale lands of his father with his\r\nmother's heritage hard by the gates of Durham, took the name of\r\nNeville, and that of Fitz-Maldred was never again heard in the family.\r\nThe lords of Raby did not at first distinguish themselves in any way\r\nabove the rest of the barons of the North Country. We find them from\r\ntime to time going forth to the King's Scotch or French wars, serving\r\nin Simon de Montfort's rebel army, wrangling with their feudal superior\r\nthe Bishop of Durham, slaying an occasional sheriff, and founding an\r\noccasional chantry, and otherwise conducting themselves after the\r\nmanner of their kind. It was one of the house who led the English\r\nvan against the Scots at the great victory of 1346, and erected the\r\ngraceful monument which gave to the battlefield the name of Neville's\r\nCross.\r\n\r\nOnly two characteristics marked these Nevilles of the thirteenth\r\nand fourteenth centuries; the largeness of their families--three\r\nsuccessive lords of Raby boasted respectively of ten, eleven, and nine\r\nchildren--and their never-ending success in laying field by field\r\nand manor by manor. Robert Neville, who in the time of Henry the\r\nThird married Ida Mitford, added to his Durham lands his wife's broad\r\nNorthumbrian barony in the valley of the Wansbeck. His son of the same\r\nname made Neville one of the greatest names in Yorkshire, when he\r\nwedded Mary of Middleham, and became in her right lord of Middleham\r\nCastle and all the manors dependent on it, reaching for a dozen miles\r\nalong the Ure and running up to the farthest bounds of the forest of\r\nCoverdale. Robert the younger's heir, Ralph, emulated the good fortune\r\nof his father and grandfather by securing as his wife Euphemia, heiress\r\nof Clavering, who brought him not only the half-hundred of Clavering in\r\nEssex, but the less remote and more valuable lands of Warkworth on the\r\nNorthumbrian coast. Ralph's son John, though he married as his first\r\nwife a younger daughter of the house of Percy, secured as his second\r\nElizabeth Latimer, heiress of an old baronial house whose domains lay\r\nscattered about Bucks and Bedfordshire.\r\n\r\nFour generations of wealthy marriages had made the Nevilles the\r\ngreatest lords in all the North Country. Even their neighbours, the\r\nPercies of Northumberland, were not so strong. The \"saltire argent on\r\nthe field gules,\" and the dun bull, the two Neville badges, were borne\r\nby hosts of retainers. Three hundred men-at-arms, of whom fourteen\r\nwere knights and three hundred archers, followed the lord of Raby even\r\nwhen he went so far afield as Brittany. For home service against the\r\nScots he could muster thrice as many. More than seventy manors were in\r\nhis hands, some spread far and wide in Essex, Norfolk, Bedfordshire,\r\nand Buckinghamshire, but the great bulk of them lying massed in North\r\nYorkshire and South Durham, around Raby and Middleham, the two strong\r\ncastles which were the centres of his influence. Hence it was not\r\nsurprising that King Richard the Second, when he lavished titles and\r\nhonours broadcast on the nobility after his surprising _coup d'état_ of\r\n1397, should have singled out the head of the Nevilles for conciliation\r\nand preferment. Accordingly, Ralph Neville, then in the thirty-fourth\r\nyear of his age, was raised to the dignity of an earl. Curiously\r\nenough, he could not be given the designation of either of the counties\r\nwhere the bulk of his broad lands lay. The earldom of Durham was, now\r\nas always, in the hands of its bishop, _comes palatinus_ of the county\r\nsince the days of William the Conqueror. The titles of York and of\r\nRichmondshire, wherein lay the other great stretch of Neville land,\r\nwere vested in members of the royal house. The Percies had twenty years\r\nbefore received the title of Northumberland, the third county where\r\nthe Nevilles held considerable property. Hence Ralph of Raby had to\r\nbe put off with the title of Westmoreland, though in that county he\r\nseems, curiously enough, not to have held a single manor. The gift of\r\nthe earldom was accompanied with the more tangible present of the royal\r\nhonour of Penrith.\r\n\r\nAll these favours, however, did not buy the loyalty of Ralph Neville.\r\nHe was married to one of John of Gaunt's daughters by Katherine\r\nSwinford, and was at heart a strong partisan of the house of Lancaster.\r\nAccordingly, when Henry of Bolingbroke landed at Ravenspur in July\r\n1399, Westmoreland was one of the first to join him; he rode with him\r\nto Flint, saw the surrender of King Richard, and bore the royal sceptre\r\nat the usurper's coronation at Westminster. Henry rewarded his services\r\nby making him Earl Marshal in place of the exiled Duke of Norfolk.\r\n\r\nEarl Ralph went on in a prosperous career, aided King Henry against\r\nthe rising of the Percies in 1403, and committed himself more firmly\r\nthan ever to the cause of the house of Lancaster by putting down the\r\ninsurrection which Scrope, Mowbray, and the aged Northumberland had\r\nraised in 1405. Twice he served King Henry as ambassador to treat with\r\nthe Scots, and twice the custody of the Border was committed to him as\r\nwarden. When Bolingbroke died, and Henry of Monmouth succeeded him,\r\nEarl Ralph was no less firm and faithful. At the famous Parliament of\r\nLeicester in 1414, when the glorious but fatal war with France was\r\nresolved upon, he was one of the few who withstood the arguments of\r\nArchbishop Chicheley and the appeals of the Duke of Exeter and gave\r\ntheir voices against the expedition. He besought the King that, if he\r\nmust needs make war, he should attack Scotland rather than France, the\r\nEnglish title to that crown being as good, the enterprise more hopeful,\r\nand the result more likely to bring permanent profit, while--quoting an\r\nold popular rhyme--he ended by saying that\r\n\r\n He that wolde France win, must with Scotland first begin.\r\n\r\nBut all men cried \"War! War! France! France!\" The ambitious young King\r\nhad his will; and the next spring there sailed from Southampton the\r\nfirst of those many gallant hosts of Englishmen who were to win so\r\nmany fruitless battles to their country's final loss, and leave their\r\nbones behind to moulder in French soil, in the trenches of Harfleur and\r\nOrleans or on the fields of Beaugé and Patay.\r\n\r\nEvery reader of Shakespeare has met Earl Ralph in the English camp on\r\nthe eve of the battle of Agincourt, remembers his downhearted wish for\r\na few thousands of the \"gentlemen of England now abed,\" and can repeat\r\nby heart the young King's stirring reply to his uncle's forebodings.\r\nBut, in fact, Earl Ralph was not at Agincourt, nor did he even cross\r\nthe sea. He had been left behind with Lord Scrope and the Baron of\r\nGreystock to keep the Scottish March, and was far away at Carlisle\r\nwhen Henry's little band of English were waiting for the dawn on that\r\neventful St. Crispin's day. Unless tradition errs, it was really Walter\r\nof Hungerford who made the speech that drew down his master's chiding.\r\n\r\nRalph was now growing an old man as the men of the fifteenth century\r\nreckoned old age; and while the brilliant campaigns of Henry the Fifth\r\nwere in progress abode at home, busied with statecraft rather than\r\nwith war. But his sons, and they were a numerous tribe, were one after\r\nanother sent across the seas to join their royal cousin. John, the heir\r\nof Westmoreland, was serving all through the campaigns of 1417-18, and\r\nwas made governor of Verneuil and other places in its neighbourhood,\r\nafter having held the trenches opposite the Porte de Normandie during\r\nthe long siege of Rouen, and assisted also at the leaguer of Caen.\r\nRalph, Richard, William, and George are found following in their elder\r\nbrother's footsteps as each of them arrived at the years of manhood,\r\nand all earned their knighthood by services done in France.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Earl Ralph, after surviving his royal nephew some three\r\nyears, and serving for a few months as one of the Privy Council that\r\ngoverned in the name of the infant Henry the Sixth, died on October\r\n21st, 1425, at the age of sixty-two, and was buried in the beautiful\r\ncollegiate church which he had founded at Staindrop, hard by the gates\r\nof his ancestral castle of Raby. There his monument still remains,\r\nescaped by good fortune from the vandalism of Edwardian and Cromwellian\r\nProtestants. He lies in full armour, wearing the peaked basinet\r\nthat was customary in his younger days, though it had gone out of\r\nfashion ere his death. His regular features have little trace of real\r\nportraiture, and show no signs of his advancing years, so that we may\r\nconclude that the sculptor had never been acquainted with the man he\r\nwas representing. Only the short twisted moustache, curling over the\r\nmail of the Earl's camail, has something of individuality, and must\r\nhave corresponded to the life; for by 1425 all the men of the younger\r\ngeneration were close shaven, like King Henry the Fifth. On Earl\r\nRalph's right hand, as befitted a princess of the blood royal, lies his\r\nsecond wife Joan of Beaufort; on his left Margaret Stafford, the bride\r\nof his youth and the mother of his heir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRICHARD OF SALISBURY\r\n\r\n\r\nEarl Ralph, surpassing all his keen and prolific ancestors not\r\nonly in the success with which he pushed his fortunes, but in the\r\nenormous family which he reared, had become the father of no less than\r\ntwenty-three children by his two wives. Nine were the offspring of\r\nMargaret of Stafford, fourteen of Joan of Beaufort. John, the heir of\r\nWestmoreland, had died a few years before his father, and the earldom\r\npassed to his son, Ralph the second, now a lad of about eighteen. But\r\nthe greater number of the other twenty-two children still survived,\r\nand their fortunes influenced the after history both of the house of\r\nNeville and the kingdom of England to such an extent that they need\r\ncareful statement.\r\n\r\nThe old Earl had turned all his energies into negotiating the marriages\r\nof his children, and partly by the favour of the two Henries, partly\r\nby judicious buying up of wardships in accordance with the practice\r\nof the fifteenth century, partly by playing on the desire of his\r\nneighbours to be allied to the greatest house of the North Country, he\r\nhad succeeded in establishing a compact family group, which was already\r\nby 1425 one of the factors to be reckoned with in English politics.\r\nThe most important of these connections by far was the wedding of his\r\nyoungest daughter Cecily to Richard Duke of York--a marriage brought\r\nabout by royal favour shortly before the Earl's death, while both the\r\ncontracting parties were mere children; the Duke some eleven years old,\r\nthe little bride about nine.[1] By this union Ralph of Westmoreland\r\nwas destined to become the ancestor of a score of kings and queens of\r\nEngland. It bound the house of Neville to the Yorkist cause, and led\r\naway the children of Ralph from that loyalty to Lancaster which had\r\nbeen the cause of their father's greatness. But at the time when the\r\nmarriage was brought about no one could well have foreseen the Wars of\r\nthe Roses, and we may acquit the Earl of any design greater than that\r\nof increasing the prosperity of his house by another marriage with a\r\nyounger branch of the royal stock. His own union with Joan of Beaufort\r\nhad served him so well, that he could desire nothing better for the\r\nnext generation. The elder brothers and sisters of Cecily of York, if\r\ntheir alliances were less exalted than hers, were yet wedded, almost\r\nwithout exception, to the most important members of the baronage.\r\n\r\nOf the elder family, the offspring of Earl Ralph by Margaret of\r\nStafford, the second son Ralph Neville of Biwell married the co-heiress\r\nof Ferrers. One sister died young, another became a nun, but four\r\nof the remaining five were married to the heirs of the houses of\r\nMauley, Dacre, Scrope of Bolton, and Kyme. The younger family, the\r\nchildren of Joan of Beaufort, made even more fortunate marriages. Of\r\nthe daughters, the youngest, as we have stated above, wedded Richard\r\nof York. Her elder sisters were united respectively to John Mowbray\r\nDuke of Norfolk, Humphrey Stafford Duke of Buckingham, and Henry Percy\r\nEarl of Northumberland--the grandson of Earl Ralph's old enemy and\r\nthe son of Hotspur. Of the six sons of Joan of Beaufort, Richard the\r\neldest married Alice Montacute, heiress of the earldom of Salisbury,\r\nand became by her the father of the Kingmaker; with him we shall have\r\nmuch to do. William, the second son, won the heiress of Fauconbridge.\r\nGeorge, the third son, was made the heir of his half-uncle John Lord\r\nLatimer, and by special grant succeeded to his uncle's barony. Robert\r\nentered the Church, and by judicious family backing became Bishop\r\nof Salisbury before he had reached his twenty-fifth year, only to\r\nbe transplanted ten years later to Durham, the most powerful of the\r\nEnglish bishoprics, whose palatine rights he could thus turn to the use\r\nof his numerous kindred. Finally, Edward, the youngest brother, secured\r\nElizabeth Beauchamp, heiress of Abergavenny.\r\n\r\nThe numbers of the English baronage had been rapidly decreasing since\r\nthe reign of the third Edward, and in the early years of Henry the\r\nSixth the total number of peers summoned to a Parliament never exceeded\r\nthirty-five. Among this small muster could be counted one grandson,\r\nthree sons, and five sons-in-law of Earl Ralph.[2] A little later,\r\none son and one grandson more were added to the peers of the Neville\r\nkindred, and it seemed probable that by the marriages of the next\r\ngeneration half the English House of Lords would be found to descend\r\nfrom the prolific stock of Raby.\r\n\r\nIn the first twenty years of the reign of Henry of Windsor, while the\r\nyoung King's personal weakness was not yet known, while his uncle of\r\nBedford and his great-uncle of Winchester stood beside the throne, and\r\nwhile the war in France--though the balance had long turned against\r\nEngland--was still far from its disastrous end, the confederacies of\r\nthe great baronial houses were of comparatively little importance. The\r\nfatal question of the succession to the Crown was still asleep, for the\r\nyoung King was only just nearing manhood, and might, for all that men\r\nknew, be the parent of as many war-like sons as his grandfather. It was\r\nnot till Henry's nine years of barren wedlock, from 1445 to 1454, set\r\nthe minds of his nobles running on the problem of the succession, that\r\nthe peace of England was really endangered.\r\n\r\nRichard Neville, the eldest of the sons of Earl Ralph's second\r\nmarriage, was born in 1399. He was too young to follow King Henry to\r\nthe siege of Harfleur and the fight of Agincourt, but a few years\r\nlater he accompanied his half-brother John, the heir of Westmoreland,\r\nto the wars of France. It was not in France, however, that the years\r\nof his early manhood were to be spent, but on the Scotch Border in\r\nthe company of his father. When he came of age and was knighted in\r\n1420 he was made the colleague of the old Earl in the wardenship of\r\nthe Western Marches. This office he retained for several years, and\r\nwas in consequence much mixed up with Scotch affairs, twice acting\r\nas commissioner to treat with the Regent of Scotland, and escorting\r\nJames the First to the border of his kingdom when the English Council\r\nreleased him from his long captivity. We hear of him occasionally at\r\nCourt, as when, for example, he acted as carver at the Coronation\r\nBanquet of the newly-wed Queen Catherine, a ceremony which, according\r\nto Monstrelet, \"was performed with such splendid magnificence that the\r\nlike had never been seen since the time of that noble knight Arthur,\r\nKing of the English and Bretons.\"\r\n\r\nRichard had reached the age of twenty-six when, in 1425, he married\r\nAlice, the only child of Thomas Montacute Earl of Salisbury, who\r\nhad just reached her eighteenth year. The Montacutes were not among\r\nthe wealthiest of the English earls--for his faithful adherence to\r\nRichard the Second the last head of the house had lost his life and\r\nhis estates; and although his son had been restored in blood, and had\r\nreceived back many of the Montacute lands, yet the list of his manors\r\nin the Escheats Roll reads poorly enough beside those of the Earls of\r\nNorfolk and Devon, March and Arundell. Earl Thomas, in spite of his\r\nfather's fate, had consented to serve the house of Lancaster.\r\n\r\nIn 1425, as we have already mentioned, the old Earl, Ralph of\r\nWestmoreland, died. In his will, which has been preserved, we find that\r\nhe left his son Richard little enough--\"two chargers, twelve dishes,\r\nand a great ewer and basin of silver, a bed of Arras, with red, white,\r\nand green hangings, and four untrained horses, the best that should\r\nbe found in his stable.\" Evidently he thought that he need do nothing\r\nfor this son on whom the earldom of Salisbury was bound to devolve. It\r\nwas only to Ralph and Edward, the two among his surviving sons who had\r\nnot yet inherited land from their wives, that the old Earl demised the\r\nbaronies of Biwell and Winlayton, two of his outlying estates.\r\n\r\nBut in another respect the will of Earl Ralph was destined to prove a\r\nsource of many heart-burnings in the house of Neville, and fated to\r\nbreak up the strict family alliance which made its strength. While\r\nhe left the Durham lands of Neville, round his ancestral castle of\r\nRaby, to his grandson and heir, Ralph the second, he made over the\r\nlarger part of his Yorkshire possessions not to the young Earl, but\r\nas jointure to his widow, Joan of Beaufort, the mother of Richard and\r\nthe other thirteen children of his second family. The Countess, once\r\nmistress of Sherif Hoton Castle and the other North-Riding lands of\r\nNeville, had no thought of letting them pass away from her own sons to\r\nthe descendants of her husband's first wife. They were destined to be\r\ndiverted from the elder to the younger family. Here lay the source of\r\nmany future troubles, but while the young Earl Ralph was still a minor\r\nthe matter did not come to a head.\r\n\r\nThree years after he lost his father, Richard Neville heard of the\r\ndeath of his father-in-law. The Earl of Salisbury had been appointed by\r\nJohn of Bedford Captain-General of all the English forces in France,\r\nand gathering together ten thousand men, all that the Regent could\r\nspare, had marched to the fatal siege of Orleans. There in the early\r\ndays of the leaguer, six months before Joan the Maid came to the rescue\r\nof the garrison, he had met his death. As he watched the walls from the\r\ntower on the bridge over the Loire, a stone shot had torn away half\r\nhis face; he died in a few days, exhorting his officers with his last\r\nbreath to persevere in the attack.\r\n\r\nThus Richard Neville became by the death of his father-in-law Earl\r\nof Salisbury and master of the lands of Montacute. They lay, for the\r\nmost part, on the borders of Wiltshire and Hampshire, between Ringwood\r\nand Amesbury, in the valleys of the Bourn and Avon. The castles of\r\nChristchurch and Trowbridge were the most important part of the\r\nheritage from the military point of view. Some scattered manors in\r\nBerkshire, Dorset, and Somerset served to swell its value. Richard,\r\nnow become a considerable South Country baron, at once did homage for\r\nhis wife's lands, and was summoned as Earl of Salisbury to the next\r\nParliament, that of 1429. At the same meeting at which he took his seat\r\nhis nephew, Ralph the younger of Westmoreland, also appeared for the\r\nfirst time, having now passed his minority and entered into possession\r\nof such of the Neville lands as had not been left to his step-mother.\r\n\r\nIt was beyond doubt the alienation of these lands which led to the\r\nestrangement between the younger and the elder Nevilles which we\r\nsoon after find taking visible form in troubles in the North. Ralph,\r\nmarrying a sister of Henry Earl of Northumberland, became the firm\r\nfriend and ally of that house of Percy which his grandfather had done\r\nso much to humble. Richard kept up the old feud, and was always found\r\non the opposite side from his nephew. Presently (the exact year of the\r\ncommencement of the quarrel is uncertain, but it was at its height in\r\n1435) we find them at actual blows in a manner which brings out the\r\nfact that the \"good and strong governance,\" which Parliament after\r\nParliament sighed for in the reign of Henry the Sixth, had already\r\nbecome a hopeless dream. Plaints come down from the North to the Lord\r\nChancellor that \"owing to the grievous differences which have arisen\r\nbetween Ralph Earl of Westmoreland, and his brothers John and Thomas\r\non the one hand, and Joan Dowager-Countess of Westmoreland and her son\r\nRichard Earl of Salisbury, on the other hand, have of late assembled,\r\nby manner of war and insurrection, great routs and companies upon\r\nthe field, which have done all manner of great offences as well in\r\nslaughter and destruction of the King's lieges as otherwise, which\r\nthings are greatly against the estate and weal and peace of this\r\nRoyaume of England.\"\r\n\r\nOf the details of this local war in Yorkshire we know nothing. Some\r\nsort of accommodation was patched up, by three arbitrators named by\r\nthe Privy Council, for the moment between uncle and nephew; but the\r\ngrudge rankled, and if ever England should be rent by civil war, it\r\ntook no prophet to foretell that the two Neville earls would be found\r\nin opposite camps.\r\n\r\nThe old Countess Joan of Westmoreland died in 1440, and left, as was\r\nnatural, Middleham, Sherif Hoton, and all the other lands of her\r\njointure to her eldest son. Richard of Salisbury thus became a much\r\ngreater landholder in the North than he already was in the South. His\r\nHampshire and Wiltshire fiefs are for the future the less important\r\ncentre of his strength. Sherif Hoton becomes his favourite residence,\r\nand it is always as a power in Yorkshire, not in Wessex, that he is\r\nmentioned by the chroniclers of the day.\r\n\r\nNeither of the Neville earls took any prominent part in the\r\nnever-ending French War. Ralph of Westmoreland seems to have been\r\nwanting both in the appetite for war and the keen eye for the main\r\nchance which had hitherto distinguished the lords of Raby. It was his\r\nyounger brother John who was the fighting man of the older branch of\r\nNeville. Earl Richard, on the other hand, was energetic enough, but\r\nseems to have preferred to push his fortunes at home, rather than to\r\nrisk his reputation in the unlucky wars where Somerset and Suffolk\r\nand so many more earned ill-fame and unpopularity. We hear of him\r\nmost often on the Scottish Border, where he seems to have succeeded\r\nto the commanding position that had once been held by his father. He\r\nwas Captain of Berwick, and served as Warden both of the Eastern and\r\nWestern Marches, till at the end of 1435 he was sent as ambassador\r\nextraordinary to Edinburgh. James the First, with whom he had to settle\r\nsome matters of Border feud, was his own connection, for Salisbury's\r\nmother was aunt of Joan Beaufort, the young Queen of Scots. After\r\nquitting King James, only a few months before his cruel murder at\r\nPerth, Earl Richard went on an embassy of far greater importance, being\r\nsent to France, along with his young brother-in-law the Duke of York,\r\nto endeavour to patch up some agreement that might end the series of\r\ndisasters which had commenced with the death of the Duke of Bedford in\r\nthe previous year. His mission failed, as indeed all missions were\r\nbound to do that made after the treaty of Arras the same demands which\r\nthe French had refused before it. Nevertheless, on his return, in 1437,\r\nSalisbury was made a member of the Privy Council, and took his seat\r\nin the body which ever since 1422 had been directing the fortunes of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nThis appointment fixed Salisbury in London for the greater part of the\r\nnext ten years. We find from the records of the Privy Council that he\r\nwas almost as regular an attendant at its meetings as was Cardinal\r\nBeaufort himself, the practical Prime Minister of the realm. His\r\nsignature appears at the foot of countless documents, and his activity\r\nand appetite for business seem to have been most exemplary. So far as\r\nwe can judge of his action, he appears to have sided with the great\r\nCardinal, and not with the Opposition which centred round Humphrey\r\nDuke of Gloucester; but factions had not fully developed themselves as\r\nyet in the Council, and the definite parties which existed a few years\r\nlater were only just beginning to sketch themselves out.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cecily is called Duchess of York in Earl's Ralph's will,\r\nso the children must therefore have been already married; but the\r\nconsummation of the marriage was not till about 1438, when he was\r\ntwenty-six and she twenty-three years of age.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The grandson was Ralph Earl of Westmoreland; the sons,\r\nRichard of Salisbury, William of Fauconbridge, and George of Latimer;\r\nthe sons-in-law, the Dukes of York, Norfolk, and Buckingham, the\r\nEarl of Northumberland, and Lord Dacre. Later, Edward Neville Lord\r\nAbergavenny, and Roger Lord Scrope, appear; the first a son, the second\r\na grandson.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE KINGMAKER'S YOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard, the second child but eldest son of Richard Neville of\r\nSalisbury and Alice Montacute, was born on November 22nd, 1428, just\r\nnineteen days after his grandfather had fallen at the siege of Orleans.\r\nWe know absolutely nothing of his childhood--not even the place of his\r\nbirth is recorded. We must suppose, but cannot prove, that his earliest\r\ndays were passed on his mother's lands in Wessex, in moving about\r\nbetween Amesbury, Christchurch, and Ringwood as his parents' household\r\nmade its periodical peregrinations from manor to manor according to\r\nthe universal practice of the time. As a boy he must have visited his\r\npaternal grandmother, Joan of Beaufort, on her Yorkshire estates, when\r\nhis father was fixed in the North as Warden of the Scotch Border. There\r\nprobably he may have imbibed some of the old lady's dislike for her\r\nstep-sons of the elder branch of the Nevilles, with whom she and his\r\nfather were now at open variance. A little later he must have spent\r\nmuch time in London, when his father became a member of the Council\r\nof Regency, lodged at the \"Tenement called the Harbour in the Ward of\r\nDowgate,\" which his father and grandmother had received by will from\r\nhis grandfather when the larger London house of the family, \"Neville's\r\nInn in Silver Street,\" passed with the Westmoreland earldom to the\r\nelder branch.\r\n\r\nThe fortunes of the house of Neville, as we have told them hitherto,\r\nhave consisted of one interminable story of fortunate marriages. The\r\nreader must now be asked to concentrate his attention on another group\r\nof these alliances, a group which settled the whole history of the\r\nKingmaker, and gave him the title of the earldom by which he is always\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nThe Beauchamps of Warwick held one of the oldest English earldoms; they\r\nrepresented in direct descent the Henry of Newburgh to whom William\r\nRufus had granted the county in 1190.[3] Richard Beauchamp, the head\r\nof the family at this time, was perhaps the worthiest and the most\r\nesteemed of the English nobles of his day. The \"gracious Warwick,\" the\r\n\"father of courtesy\" as the Emperor Sigismund called him, had been\r\nthrough all the wars of Henry the Fifth, and won therein a name only\r\nsecond to that of the King himself. He had seen many cities and men in\r\nevery land that lay between England and Palestine, and left everywhere\r\nbehind him a good report. His virtues and accomplishments had caused\r\nhim to be singled out as tutor and governor to the young King, Henry\r\nthe Sixth; no better model, as all agreed, could be found for the ruler\r\nof England to copy. Nor did Warwick belie his task; he made Henry\r\nupright, learned, painstaking, conscientious to a fault. If he could\r\nbut have made him as strong in body and spirit as he was morally, he\r\nwould have given England the best king that ever she possessed.\r\n\r\nRichard Beauchamp had married Isabel, heiress of Despenser, and widow\r\nof Richard, Lord of Abergavenny. Their family consisted of a son,\r\nHenry, a boy of ten, and a daughter, Anne, three years younger. In\r\naddition, the Countess of Warwick had an only daughter by her first\r\nhusband, who was heiress of Abergavenny. Beauchamp and Richard Neville\r\nof Salisbury were the best of friends, and had determined to seal their\r\nfriendship by intermarriage between their families. The alliance was\r\ndestined to be complicated; each earl married his heir to his friend's\r\ndaughter. The boy Henry, heir of Warwick, was affianced to Cecily\r\nNeville, Salisbury's six-year-old daughter; the boy Richard, heir of\r\nSalisbury, to Anne Beauchamp, daughter of Warwick. Nor was this all;\r\nthe family relations were complicated by the marriage of Warwick's\r\nstep-daughter Elizabeth, the heiress of Abergavenny, to Edward Neville\r\nthe younger brother of Salisbury.\r\n\r\nThe boy Richard Neville received a competent dowry with his wife, but\r\nnothing more was expected to follow from the marriage. Fate, however,\r\ndecreed otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe old Earl of Warwick died in 1439, full of years and honours.\r\nTo him succeeded his son Henry, the husband of Cecily Neville, now\r\nsixteen years of age, and \"a seemly lord of person.\" He had been\r\nbrought up with the young King, a lad of his own years, and was Henry\r\nof Lancaster's bosom friend. When the King came of age he heaped on\r\nthe young Beauchamp every honour that his affection could devise. Not\r\nonly was he made Knight of the Garter and a Privy Councillor before\r\nhe was nineteen, but he was created Duke of Warwick, and invested\r\nby the King's own hands with the lordship of the Isle of Wight. If\r\nHenry Beauchamp had lived, it would have been he, and not Suffolk\r\nand Somerset, who in a few years would have ruled England. But his\r\ncareer was broken in its earliest promise. Ere he had finished his\r\ntwenty-third year Henry Beauchamp was cut off from the land of the\r\nliving, and his lands and duchy devolved on his only child, a little\r\ngirl but four years of age. Her wardship fell to William de la Pole\r\nEarl of Suffolk, already the declared adversary of Salisbury and the\r\nNeville family.\r\n\r\nBy the wholly unexpected death of Henry Beauchamp only this one frail\r\nlife lay between the lad Richard Neville--he was sixteen when his\r\nbrother-in-law died--and the earldom of Warwick. Nor was that life to\r\ncontinue long. The child Anne Beauchamp survived for three years more,\r\nand then died, aged seven, on June 23rd, 1449. She was buried by her\r\ngrandam Constance, daughter of Edmund Duke of York, before the high\r\naltar of Reading Abbey.\r\n\r\nThe heiress of Warwick was now the elder Anne, Richard Neville's young\r\nwife,[4] and in her right Richard received the Beauchamp lands from the\r\nunwilling hands of the little countess's guardian, Suffolk. The patent\r\nwhich created him Earl of Warwick, and joined his wife in the grant,\r\nwas dated July 23rd, 1449.\r\n\r\nThus, in the year in which he reached his twenty-first birthday, the\r\nfuture Kingmaker became \"Earl of Warwick, Newburgh, and Aumarle,\r\nPremier Earl of England, Baron of Elmley and Hanslape, and Lord of\r\nGlamorgan and Morgannoc.\" He was now a much more important personage\r\nthan his own father, for the Beauchamp and Despenser manors in the West\r\nMidlands and the Welsh Marches were broader by far than the Montacute\r\nlands in Wessex, or the Neville holding round Middleham.\r\n\r\nA short survey of the items of the Beauchamp heritage is necessary\r\nto show how wide-spread was the power which was now placed in the\r\nhands of the young Richard Neville. Perhaps the most compact block\r\nof his new possessions was the old Despenser holding in South Wales\r\nand Herefordshire, which included the castles of Cardiff, Neath,\r\nCaerphilly, Llantrussant, Seyntweonard, Ewyas Lacy, Castle-Dinas,\r\nSnodhill, Whitchurch, and Maud's Castle. Caerphilly alone was a\r\nstronghold fit to resist ten thousand men, with its tremendous rings\r\nof concentric fortification; and the massive Norman masonry of Cardiff\r\nwas still ready for good service. Between Neath and Ewyas Lacy lay no\r\nless than fifty manors of the Despenser heritage. In Gloucestershire\r\nwas another group of estates which the Beauchamps had got from the\r\nDespensers--of which the chief were the wide and populous manors of\r\nTewkesbury, Sodbury, Fairford, Whittington, Chedworth, Wickwar, and\r\nLydney. In Worcestershire there was a compact block of land along the\r\nSevern and on both its banks; the largest manors included in it were\r\nUpton-on-Severn, Hanley Castle, and Bewdley, but there were twenty-four\r\nmore estates of less importance, together with the Castle of Elmley,\r\nwhich had given the Beauchamps a baron's title. In Warwickshire,\r\nbeside the fair town and castle which went with the earldom, there were\r\nnot any very broad tracts of land--only nine manors in all, but one of\r\nthese was the wealthy manor of Tamworth. Going farther south in the\r\nMidlands we find in Oxfordshire five manors and the forest of Wychwood\r\nreckoned to the Beauchamps, and in Buckinghamshire the baronial seat of\r\nHanslape and seven manors more. Nor was it only in central England that\r\nRichard Neville could count his estates; there were scattered holdings\r\naccruing to him in Kent, Hampshire, Sussex, Essex, Hertfordshire,\r\nSuffolk, Norfolk, Berkshire, Wiltshire, Somerset, Devon, Cornwall,\r\nNorthampton, Stafford, Cambridge, Rutland, and Nottingham, amounting\r\nin all to forty-eight manors. Even in the distant North one isolated\r\npossession fell to him--the castle of Barnard's-Castle on the Tees. If\r\nin addition to the manors we began to count up the scattered knights'\r\nfees, the advowsons of churches, the chantries, the patronage of\r\nabbeys, and the tenements in towns, which formed part of the Beauchamp\r\nheritage, we should never be done; but these are all written in the\r\nEscheats Roll, whence the antiquary may excavate them at his will.\r\n\r\nThe year 1449, in which Richard Neville attained his majority and\r\ngathered in his wife's heritage, was the turning-point in the reign of\r\nHenry the Sixth. No more critical time could have been found in the\r\nwhole century in which to place power and influence in the hands of a\r\nyoung, able, and ambitious man. For it was in 1449 that the doom of the\r\nhouse of Lancaster was settled by the final collapse of the English\r\ndomination in France. In March came the fatal attack on Fougères which\r\nreopened the war, an attack of which it is hard to say whether it was\r\nmore foolish or wicked. In August, September, and October occurred with\r\nbewildering rapidity the fall of the great towns of eastern and central\r\nNormandy, ending with the capitulation of Rouen after a siege of only\r\nnineteen days.\r\n\r\nIt was this unparalleled series of disasters which made the existing\r\nLancastrian rule unbearable to the English nation. Suffolk, the\r\nminister whose policy had led up to the disaster, and Somerset, the\r\ngovernor whose avarice had depleted the Norman garrisons, and whose\r\nrashness and ill faith had precipitated the outbreak of hostilities,\r\nwere henceforth pursued by the bitter hatred of the majority of\r\nEnglishmen. When it was found that King Henry identified their cause\r\nwith his own, he himself--against whom no one had previously breathed a\r\nword--found for the first time that the current of public opinion was\r\nsetting against him.\r\n\r\nIt was now that the final scission of the two parties that were\r\nafterwards to be known as Yorkist and Lancastrian took place. Every\r\nman of note in England had now to make his choice whether his personal\r\nloyalty to the King should lead him into acquiescing in the continuance\r\nin office of the ministers whom Henry openly favoured, or whether he\r\nwould set himself in opposition to the Court faction, even though he\r\nwas thereby led into opposition to the King.\r\n\r\nFrom the first moment there was no doubt which of the two courses\r\nwould be adopted by the two Neville earls of the younger branch.\r\nWarwick, now as always, acted in strict union with his father, and\r\nSalisbury had never been a friend of Suffolk. Moreover, they were\r\nboth concerned in behalf of their relative the Duke of York, who by\r\nSomerset's contrivance had been sent into a kind of honorary exile in\r\nIreland. When the crisis should come, it was already pretty certain\r\nthat Salisbury and Warwick would be found on the side of York, and\r\nnot on that of Suffolk and Somerset. But as yet, though men were\r\ngrowing excited and preparing for evil times, no one foresaw the exact\r\nshape which the troubles were to take. One thing only was certain,\r\nthat Suffolk and Somerset were growing so hateful to the nation that\r\nan explosion against them would soon take place, and that when the\r\nexplosion came there would be a large party among the leading men of\r\nEngland who would rejoice in its effects.\r\n\r\nThe most ominous sign of the times was that the great barons on both\r\nsides were already quietly arming, seeing to the numbers of their\r\nretainers, and concluding agreements to take their neighbours into\r\ntheir livery if the worst should come to the worst.\r\n\r\nNothing can be a more typical sign of the times than the treaty which\r\nSalisbury entered into with a Westmoreland knight, whose lands lay not\r\nfar from his great holding in the North-Riding, as early as September\r\n1449, the very month when Somerset was losing Normandy.\r\n\r\n\"This indenture made between Richard Earl of Salisbury, on the one\r\npart, and Walter Strykelande knight, on the other, beareth witness\r\nthat the said Walter is retained and withholded with the said Earl for\r\nthe term of his life, against all folk, saving his allegiance to the\r\nKing. And the said Walter shall be well and conveniently horsed, armed,\r\nand arrayed, and always ready to bide come and go with to and for the\r\nsaid Earl, at all times and places, as well in time of peace as time\r\nof war, at the wages of the same Earl.\" Walter's following was worth\r\nhaving, being \"servants, tenants, and inhabitants within the county\r\nof Westmoreland; bowmen with horse and harness, sixty-nine; billmen\r\nhorsed and harnessed, seventy-four; bowmen without horses, seventy-one;\r\nbillmen without horses, seventy-six\"--in fact a little army of two\r\nhundred and ninety men. The existence of a few such treaties as this\r\nbetween Salisbury and his northern neighbours shows clearly enough\r\nhow the Neville power was built up, and how formidable to the public\r\npeace it might become. If once such treaties were in existence, how\r\nlong would it be before the single clause \"saving his allegiance\" would\r\nbegin to drop into oblivion?\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The Beauchamps came into the title in 1268, William de\r\nBeauchamp having married the grand-daughter of Henry of Newburgh, whose\r\nmale issue had died out.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Anne was the only heir of the full blood to Henry Duke of\r\nWarwick, but he had several half-sisters, to whom the reversion of the\r\ntitle was left by the patent which gave Richard and Anne Neville the\r\nearldom.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSE OF YORK\r\n\r\n\r\nIf 1449, the year of Warwick's accession to his wife's heritage, was\r\na time of trouble for England, the year which immediately followed\r\nwas far worse. The loss of the Norman fortresses was followed in a\r\nfew months by the sporadic outbreaks of popular rage which might have\r\nbeen expected--outbreaks directed against all who could in any way be\r\nconnected with the evil governance of the realm. Bishop Moleyns, the\r\nKeeper of the Privy Seal, was murdered by a mob of mutinous sailors at\r\nPortsmouth in January. But this blow was only a premonitory symptom\r\nof the storm which was brewing against Suffolk, the head of the\r\nGovernment. Four months later--the fatal battle of Formigny had been\r\nfought meanwhile, and the last English foothold in Northern France\r\nlost--he was driven from power by an irresistible demonstration of\r\nwrath, in which the whole nation, from the House of Lords to the London\r\nmob, took its part. Protected from legal punishment by the King's\r\npardon, Suffolk fled over-sea; but some London ships waylaid him in the\r\nStraits of Dover, and he was seized and put to death after a mock trial\r\nby the captain of the _Nicholas of the Tower_. So well hated was he\r\nthat his tragic end was received with exultation instead of remorse,\r\nand the political ballad-mongers of the day wrote many an insulting\r\nrhyme over his headless corpse.\r\n\r\nInstead of mending matters, Suffolk's death was only the signal for\r\nworse troubles. Two months after his death came the great rebellion of\r\nthe Kentishmen under Cade, accompanied by various other outbreaks in\r\nthe southern counties. The insurgents were inspired by the same impulse\r\nwhich had slain Suffolk; they were set on making an end of all who\r\nhad been responsible for the late disaster abroad and misgovernment\r\nat home. In London, Lord Say the Treasurer was caught and slain; in\r\nWiltshire, Bishop Ayscough was beheaded by a mob of his own tenantry.\r\nBut the rising, being but a sudden ebullition of rage with no plan or\r\nprogramme of reform, and being headed not by any respectable leader\r\nbut merely by the disreputable adventurer Cade, died down of its own\r\naccord, without leaving any permanent effect on the governance of the\r\nrealm. To make its power felt, the national discontent had to look for\r\na responsible leader and a definite programme.\r\n\r\nBoth the Court party and the people knew where that leader might be\r\nfound. Richard Duke of York, the heir-apparent to the childless King,\r\nlay across the sea in Ireland. He was an able soldier, much tried in\r\nthe French wars, a firm and successful administrator--he had even\r\nsucceeded in winning popularity in Ireland--and a man of blameless\r\ncharacter, who had completely won the nation's confidence. Moreover,\r\nhe was a man with a grievance; though the first prince of the blood,\r\nhe was deliberately excluded from all place in the King's councils or\r\nshare in the administration of the realm. While in the midst of a\r\nsuccessful campaign in France he had been superseded by the unlucky\r\nSomerset, and sent off to Ireland, apparently in the idea that like\r\nmost other rulers of that distressful country he would wreck his\r\nreputation there. But he had been fortunate, and only increased his\r\nfame by the administration of the island. Already the Court party were\r\nmurmuring against him once more, and the people believed that some\r\nother exile would ere long be found for him. As the ballad-monger sang--\r\n\r\n The falcon flies and has no rest\r\n Till he wot where he may build his nest.\r\n\r\nCade's rebels had used the Duke's name largely in their proclamations,\r\nbut there seems no real ground for supposing that they had held any\r\ncommunication with him. The only evidence against him was that all\r\ndiscontented parties and persons spoke of him as the man that should\r\nright them some day. Nevertheless threats were made that he should\r\nbe indicted for high treason, and action against him was apparently\r\nimminent. Then at last York took the initiative. He threw up the\r\ngovernment of Ireland, crossed over to Wales, and came up to London\r\nwith a considerable body of his tenants from the Marches at his back.\r\nThere he claimed and obtained an interview with the King, in which\r\nhe declared his loyalty, and received Henry's assurance that no harm\r\nwas intended against him. This done, he retired to his estates on the\r\nWelsh border. But he had now definitely put himself at the head of\r\nthe opposition to the Court party, whom he had bitterly rated in his\r\nremonstrance to the King.\r\n\r\nThe discontent of England had found its mouthpiece and its leader in\r\nthis resolute prince, \"a man of low stature, with a short square face,\r\nand somewhat stout of body,\" like his uncle Edmund of York, who had\r\nfallen at Agincourt rather stifled in his armour than slain by his\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nOur whole view of the conduct of Warwick in the ten years between 1450\r\nand 1460 must be determined by our decision as to the designs and\r\nconduct of his uncle of York during that period. If we conclude that\r\nthe Duke was aiming at the crown from the first, then we cannot but\r\nbelieve that his brother-in-law Salisbury and his nephew Warwick must\r\nhave known or guessed his wishes, and on them must rest almost as great\r\na share of blame for the outbreak of the Civil War as lies on the head\r\nof York himself. For the gain of their family we must believe that they\r\nsacrificed the peace of their country. This view has been commonly\r\nadopted by historians; it was set forth in every Lancastrian manifesto\r\nof the time; it was repeated by the historians who wrote under the\r\nTudors, and it still prevails.\r\n\r\nAnother view, however, was taken by the majority of the English people\r\nin York's own day. Wherever in England public spirit ran strong,\r\nwherever wealth had accumulated and civilisation had advanced, a\r\nsympathy for the Yorkist party manifested itself. Kent, London, and\r\nEast Anglia were always strongly on the Duke's side. But if York had\r\nbeen an ambitious schemer, deliberately upsetting the peace of the\r\nrealm for his own ends, we should not expect to find his supporters\r\namong those parts of the nation to whom peace and good governance were\r\nabove all things profitable.\r\n\r\nA glance through the pages of the chroniclers who were contemporary\r\nwith the war, Harding, Gregory, William of Worcester, Whethamsted,\r\nthe anonymous English chronicler in the Camden Series, shows that to\r\nthe majority of the English people York passed not as a disturber of\r\nthe peace, but as a wronged and injured man, goaded into resistance\r\nby the machinations of the Court party. In one aspect he was regarded\r\nas a great lord of the royal blood excluded from his rightful place\r\nat the Council board, and even kept out of the country by his enemies\r\nwho had the King's ear. In another he was regarded as the leader\r\nand mouthpiece of the Opposition of the day, of the old and popular\r\nwar-party which inherited the traditions of Henry the Fifth and\r\nHumphrey of Gloucester--a party, indeed, whose views (as we have said\r\nelsewhere) were unwise and even immoral, but one which might reasonably\r\nask to be taken into consideration by those who managed the affairs of\r\nthe realm. In these days of ours when Ministries prove incapable and\r\ngrow discredited the Opposition has its turn at the helm in the natural\r\ncourse of things. In the fifteenth century the old methods which had\r\nserved Simon de Montfort, and the Lords Ordainers of 1322, were still\r\nthe only ones which could be used against ministers who were out of\r\nsympathy with the nation. York was doing at St. Albans much what Earl\r\nSimon had done at Lewes.\r\n\r\nThis too must be said, that if disaster without and disorder within\r\nare to be held sufficient to discredit any rule, there had never been\r\na time since the evil days of Bannockburn when England had more right\r\nto be discontented with her rulers. Moreover, there was no chance\r\nthat things would grow better; as long as the Queen and her friends\r\nruled the King, so long would things continue as they were. Men thought\r\nat one moment that with the removal of Suffolk the evil times would\r\ncome to an end. But when an outburst of popular fury swept Suffolk to\r\nhis end--and be it remembered that there is no evidence to connect\r\nYork with Suffolk's tragic death--the ascendency of Somerset proved\r\nas disastrous and as hopeless as that of his predecessor. And when\r\nSomerset fell at St. Albans men hoped once more that matters would\r\nright themselves; but the less-known ministers who soon succeeded\r\nto the helm--Beaumont and the Earl of Wiltshire--proved quite as\r\nunprofitable servants to the nation. As long as the Queen was at the\r\nKing's side to choose his councillors for him, so long would the\r\ndiscontent of England continue to increase. Margaret's misfortunes\r\nmake us loath to speak evil of her, but in fairness to the Yorkists it\r\nmust be remembered that she was the most detestable politician that\r\nEngland had known. It is usual to call the dislike of the nation for\r\nher a stupid prejudice against a foreigner; but there was surely some\r\nreason for hating the woman who sold Berwick to the Scots and Calais\r\nto the French, who reintroduced the hateful practice of sweeping\r\nattainders in the Parliament of 1459, who succeeded in turning loyalty\r\ninto a party-cry by making the King a party-leader. Well might she\r\nconfess to a foreign friend on one occasion \"that if the great lords\r\nof her own party knew what she was doing, they would themselves be the\r\nfirst to rise and put her to death,\" for she it was who committed that\r\nfoulest treason of all--which consists in sending secretly to tell a\r\nforeign enemy where to strike, in order that by his blow a party-end\r\nmay be served. In 1457, when the realm was for a moment at peace, she\r\ndeliberately incited the French admirals to make their great descent on\r\nthe Kentish coast which ended in the fearful sack of Sandwich, merely\r\nbecause she knew that such a disaster would be counted against her\r\npolitical enemies the Yorkists. There is nothing to be compared to it\r\nin English history except the conduct of the arch-traitor Marlborough\r\nin 1694 over the affair of Brest.\r\n\r\nThe English hatred of Queen Margaret was no prejudice, but a wholesome\r\ninstinct which led the English nation to recognise its enemy. She made\r\nherself a party-leader, and as a party-leader she had to be treated.\r\nYork's ten years' strife with her must be regarded not so much as the\r\nrebellion of a subject against his sovereign, but as the struggle of\r\none party-leader against another with the primitive weapons which\r\nalone were possible in the constitutional crises of that day. But even\r\nif we grant that York had his excuses, and that his general attitude\r\ndoes not stand self-condemned at the first glance, it remains to be\r\nseen how far his programme was justifiable, and how far he honestly\r\nendeavoured to carry it out to the best of his abilities. That he was\r\nan able, self-confident, ambitious man, with the fixed idea that he was\r\nthe victim of the intrigues of the Court party, and that but for those\r\nintrigues he would be able to assume the position in the King's Council\r\nto which his birth entitled him, we know well. That when the King\r\nremained childless for nine years after his marriage, York could not\r\nhelp dwelling on the near prospect of his accession to the throne, was\r\nmatter of notoriety. When that prospect was suddenly taken from him\r\nby the unexpected birth of an heir to the crown, York's spirits were\r\ndeeply dashed, and his friends murmured in secret about changelings\r\nand bastards. But his own attitude and language were still everything\r\nthat could be required by the most exacting critic; he shared in the\r\nrejoicings at the birth of Prince Edward, and joined the Commission\r\nwhich was appointed to confer on the infant the title of Prince of\r\nWales. All his speeches and manifestoes for the next six years were\r\nfull even to satiety of professions of loyalty to the King, and no\r\nclaims on his own part were ever made for anything more than that right\r\nof access to the King's ear to which he was obviously entitled. The\r\nYorkist declarations are always statements of grievance and demands for\r\nreform, set forth on public grounds; they show no traces of dynastic\r\nclaims. The actions of the party, too, are quite in keeping with their\r\ndeclarations. That they would take the King into their own hands, and\r\nnot leave him in those of the Somersets or Wiltshire or Beaumont, they\r\nhad always stated, and they attempted no more when they had the chance.\r\nThe best criterion of York's honesty is his conduct after the first\r\nbattle of St. Albans, when the fortune of war had placed the King's\r\nperson in his power. He then proceeded to give Henry new ministers, but\r\ndid absolutely nothing more. No word about the succession was breathed,\r\nnor was it even attempted to punish those who had previously ruled\r\nthe kingdom so ill. With a wise moderation all the blame was heaped\r\non Somerset--and Somerset was dead, and could suffer no harm whatever\r\nmight be laid to his charge.\r\n\r\nIt may then fairly be argued that Warwick and all those who followed\r\nRichard of York in peace and war down to the year 1460 had an honest\r\nprogramme, and could in all sincerity trust their leader, when he\r\nassured them that his ends were national and not personal,--the reform\r\nof the governance of England, not the establishment of the house\r\nof York on the throne. We shall see that when, after enduring and\r\ninflicting many evils, York did at last lay claim to the throne, his\r\nown party, headed by Warwick, firmly withstood him and compelled him,\r\nin adherence to his and their original pledges, to leave King Henry his\r\nthrone and content himself with the prospect of an ultimate succession.\r\n\r\nThis being so, it is only just to Warwick and the other Yorkist leaders\r\nto give them the benefit of the doubt wherever their conduct admits of\r\nan honourable explanation, and not to judge their earlier assertions or\r\nclaims or complaints in the light of later events. On these lines we\r\nshall proceed to describe the young Earl's actions down to the final\r\noutbreak of war in 1459.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNING OF THE CIVIL WAR: ST ALBANS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the moment when York returned from Ireland without the King's\r\npermission, and commenced to expostulate with his royal kinsman against\r\nthe doings of Somerset and the rest of the Court party, the progress\r\nof events was sure and steady. Nothing save some extraordinary chance\r\ncould have warded off the inevitable Civil War. That it did not break\r\nout sooner was only due to the fact that York was as cautious as he\r\nwas determined, and was content to wait for the crown which the King's\r\nsickly constitution and long-barren wedlock promised him. Moreover, the\r\nCourt party themselves had no desire to push matters to extremities\r\nagainst the man who was in all probability to become their king at no\r\nvery distant date. For more than four years the struggle between York\r\nand Somerset proceeded before swords were actually drawn; they fought\r\nby manifestoes and proclamations, by Acts of Parliament, by armed\r\ndemonstrations, but neither would actually strike the first blow.\r\n\r\nThe final crisis was brought about by the juxtaposition of two events\r\nof very different character. In August 1453 the King fell into a\r\nmelancholy madness, exactly similar to that which had afflicted his\r\nunfortunate grandfather Charles the Sixth of France. He sat for days\r\nwithout moving or speaking; whatever was said to him he cast down\r\nhis eyes and answered nought. The King's insanity was a deadly blow\r\nto Somerset, for he was helpless without the royal name to back him.\r\nYork, on the other hand, with the general consent of the nation,\r\nassumed the direction of affairs, and became the King's lieutenant.\r\nHe was afterwards made Protector of the Realm. This promised a final\r\ntermination to the civil troubles of the realm.\r\n\r\nBut a few months after the King had become deranged, the whole face of\r\naffairs was changed by the birth of an heir to the crown. The Queen\r\nwas delivered of a son on October 13th. This unexpected event--for the\r\nroyal pair had been childless for nine years--was of fatal import to\r\nYork. It took away the safety that had proceeded from the fact that\r\nhis enemies believed that he was one day to reign over them, and it\r\nmade York himself desperate. He came to the conclusion that he must be\r\neither regent or nothing; to save his head he must resort to desperate\r\nmeasures, and no more shrink from arms.\r\n\r\nIt is at this moment that Warwick begins to come to the front. In the\r\nearlier phases of York's struggle with Somerset he and his father had\r\navoided committing themselves unreservedly to their kinsman's party;\r\nwhen he made his armed demonstration in 1452 they had not appeared\r\nat his side, but had negotiated in his favour with the King. In the\r\nParliament of January 1454 they took part more decidedly in his favour.\r\nMischief was brewing and every peer came up to London with hundreds of\r\nretainers in his train. It was then noticed that Warwick \"with a goodly\r\nfellowship at his back\" rode up in company with his uncle of York, and\r\nthat Salisbury with sevenscore men-at-arms joined him in London.\r\n\r\nYork's preponderance in the councils of the realm was at once followed\r\nby the promotion of his Neville kinsmen. In December Warwick, now aged\r\ntwenty-five, was made a member of the Privy Council. In April, after\r\nYork had been made Protector, Salisbury was made Chancellor of the\r\nRealm; it was forty-four years since a layman had held the post.\r\n\r\nThe King was insane for sixteen months, and for that time York governed\r\nthe realm with discretion and success. His conduct with regard to the\r\nquestion of the succession was scrupulously correct. The infant Prince\r\nEdward was acknowledged heir to the throne, and York, Warwick, and\r\nSalisbury were all members of the Commission which in April invested\r\nhim with the title of Prince of Wales. The Court party were treated\r\nwith leniency; only Somerset, against whom the popular outcry was as\r\nloud as ever (he had nearly been torn to pieces by a London mob in\r\n1453), was committed to custody in the Tower, where he lay all the time\r\nof the King's madness. The country seemed satisfied and the prospect\r\nwas fair.\r\n\r\nTo the Nevilles these two last years of promotion and success had only\r\nbeen clouded by a fierce quarrel with the house of Percy. In 1453\r\nSalisbury had been celebrating the marriage of his fourth son, Thomas,\r\nto a niece of Lord Cromwell at Tattershall in Yorkshire. As he left the\r\nfeast his retainers fell into an affray with some followers of Thomas\r\nPercy Lord Egremont, a younger son of the Earl of Northumberland. Out\r\nof this small spark sprung a sudden outbreak of private war all over\r\nthe counties of York and Northumberland, in which the Nevilles were\r\nheaded by John, Salisbury's second son, and the Percies by Egremont.\r\nThe trouble lasted more than a year, and was only ended by York going\r\nin person, after he had been made Protector, to pacify the combatants.\r\nIn this he succeeded, but the Percies maintained that they had been\r\nwronged, and were ever afterwards strong supporters of Somerset and the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nIn December 1454 King Henry came to his senses, and York resigned the\r\nprotectorate. The King's recovery was in every way unfortunate; the\r\nmoment that he was himself again he fell back into the hands of the\r\nCourt party. His first act was to release Somerset from the Tower, and\r\ndeclare him a true and faithful subject. His next was to dismiss York\r\nand Salisbury from all their offices, and with them several other high\r\nfunctionaries who were enemies of Somerset, including Tiptoft Earl of\r\nWorcester, the Lord Treasurer. The disgraced peers retired to their\r\nestates--York to Sendal, Salisbury to Middleham.\r\n\r\nBut worse was to come. In May a Council, to which were summoned neither\r\nYork, Salisbury, Warwick, nor any other of the old councillors who were\r\ntheir friends, met at Westminster. This body summoned a Parliament to\r\nmeet at Leicester, \"for the purpose of providing for the safety of the\r\nKing's person against his enemies.\" Who would be declared the enemies\r\nYork and Salisbury could guess without difficulty; and what would be\r\ndone with these enemies they knew well enough. Imprisonment would be\r\nthe least evil to be feared at the hands of Somerset.\r\n\r\nThe fatal moment had come. York was desperate, and resolved to\r\nanticipate the vengeance of his adversaries. The moment that the news\r\ncame, he called out his Yorkshire retainers, and sent to ask the aid\r\nof his friends all over England. Salisbury joined him at once with the\r\nNeville tenants from his North-Riding estates, and without a moment's\r\ndelay York and his brother-in-law marched on London. Warwick fell in\r\nwith them on the way, but no other friend came to their aid, though\r\nthe Duke of Norfolk was getting together a considerable force on their\r\nbehalf in East Anglia.\r\n\r\nYork's little army marched down the Ermine Street; on May 20th he lay\r\nat Royston in Cambridgeshire. Beside the two Nevilles he had only one\r\nother peer in his company, Lord Clinton, and the knights present were\r\nmerely the personal followers of York and Salisbury. Except a few of\r\nWarwick's Midland tenants, the whole army was composed of the Yorkshire\r\nretainers of York and Salisbury, and the chroniclers speak of the whole\r\narmy as the Northern Men. More troops could have been had by waiting,\r\nbut the Duke knew that if he delayed, the enemy would also gain time\r\nto muster in strength. At present the lords of the King's Council were\r\nquite unprepared for war, and the rapid march of York's little army had\r\nnot allowed them time for preparation.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st the Duke felt his way southward along the line of the\r\nErmine Street, and lay at Ware. There he and the two Earls indited a\r\nlaborious apology for their arrival in arms to \"their most redoubted\r\nsovereign Lord the King.\" They were \"coming in grace, as true and\r\nhumble liegemen, to declare and show at large their loyalty,\" and\r\nsought instant admission to the royal presence that they might convince\r\nhim of the \"sinister, malicious, and fraudulent reports of their\r\nenemies.\"\r\n\r\nSomerset read clearly enough the meaning of York's march on London,\r\nand even before the Duke's manifesto was received, had stirred up the\r\nKing to have recourse to arms. Many of the great lords of the King's\r\nparty were in London, but they were surprised by the sudden approach\r\nof the enemy, and had brought few followers with them. Thus it came\r\nto pass that although the King marched out of Westminster on the 21st\r\nwith many of the greatest lords of England at his back, he had less\r\nthan three thousand combatants in his host. With him went forth his\r\nhalf-brother Jasper of Pembroke, the Dukes of Somerset and Buckingham,\r\nthe Earls of Northumberland, Devon, Stafford, Wiltshire, and Dorset,\r\nand Lords Clifford, Dudley, Berners, and Roos, nearly a quarter of the\r\nscanty peerage of England. York's manifesto reached the King as he\r\nmarched through Kilburn, but Somerset sent it back without allowing\r\nit to reach the royal hands. That night the army turned off the Roman\r\nroad to shelter themselves in the houses of Watford; but next morning\r\nvery early all were afoot again, and long before seven o'clock King\r\nHenry and his host reached St. Albans. The royal banner was pitched\r\nin St. Peter's Street, at the northern end of the straggling little\r\ntown, the outlets of the streets were barricaded, and then the troops\r\ndispersed to water their horses and prepare breakfast. An hour later\r\nYork and his forces appeared, advancing cautiously from the east along\r\nthe Hertford Road. Hearing of the King's march on Watford, the Duke\r\nhad left the direct line of advance on London, and set out to seek\r\nhis enemies. When St. Albans was found to be strongly held, York,\r\nSalisbury, and Warwick drew up their four thousand men in battle array,\r\nin a field called Keyfield to the east of the town, and paused before\r\nattacking. They were hardly arrived before the Duke of Buckingham\r\nwas seen emerging with a herald from the barricade which closed the\r\neastern outlet of the town. This elderly nobleman was Salisbury's\r\nbrother-in-law and Warwick's uncle; he was sure of a fair hearing\r\nfrom the insurgents, for he had never been identified with the party\r\nof Suffolk and Somerset, and was in arms out of pure loyalty to the\r\nKing. Arrived in the presence of the rebel leaders, Humphrey of\r\nBuckingham demanded the cause of their coming and the nature of their\r\nintentions. The Duke of York replied by charging his master's envoy\r\nwith a message for the royal ears, which began with all manner of\r\nearnest protestations of loyalty, proceeded with a vague declaration\r\nthat the intent of his coming in arms was righteous and true, and ended\r\nwith a peremptory demand that it would please the King \"to deliver up\r\nsuch persons as he might accuse, to be dealt with like as they have\r\ndeserved.\" Buckingham brought the message back and repeated it to the\r\nKing, as he sat in the house of Westley, the Hundredman of the town\r\nof St. Albans, whither he had retired after his arrival. When the\r\nDuke's demand was made known, for once in his life the saintly King\r\nburst out into a fit of passion. \"Now I shall know,\" he cried, \"what\r\ntraitors are so bold as to raise a host against me in my own land. And\r\nby the faith that I owe to St. Edward and the Crown of England, I will\r\ndestroy them every mother's son, to have example to all traitors who\r\nmake such rising of people against their King and Governour. And for a\r\nconclusion, say that rather than they shall have any lord here with me\r\nat this time, I will this day for his sake and in this quarrel stand\r\nmyself to live or die.\"\r\n\r\nWhen this answer came to the Duke of York he made no immediate attack\r\non the town, but turned to harangue his troops. He told them that the\r\nKing refused all reformation or reparation, that the fate of England\r\nlay in their hands, and that at the worst an honourable death in the\r\nfield was better than the shame of a traitor's end, which awaited\r\nthem if they lost the day. Then he launched the whole body in three\r\ndivisions against the barricades which obstructed the northern,\r\nsouthern, and eastern exits of the town.\r\n\r\nThe hour was half-past eleven o'clock, for the interchange of messages\r\nbetween the King and York had consumed four hours of the morning.\r\nThe royal troops, seeing Buckingham coming and going between the two\r\narmies, had believed that an agreement would be patched up without\r\nfighting. Many had left their posts, and some had disarmed themselves.\r\nWhen the Duke's men were seen in motion every man ran to arms, and\r\nthe bells of the abbey and the churches ringing the alarm set monks\r\nand townsmen to prayers, in good hope that the shield of their\r\nwarrior-patron would be stretched over them to ward off the plundering\r\nbands from the North, the\r\n\r\n Gens Boreæ, gens perfidiæ, gens prona rapinæ,\r\n\r\nwhose advent always sent Abbot Whethamsted into an ecstasy of bad Latin\r\nverses.\r\n\r\nThe first rush of the Yorkists was beaten off at all the three\r\npoints which they attacked. Lord Clifford on the London Road \"kept\r\nthe barriers so strongly that the Duke might not in any wise, for\r\nall the power he had, break into the streets.\" Warwick too, who led\r\nthe left division of the Yorkist host, was repulsed in his attack on\r\nthe southern exit of the town. But the Earl's quick military eye,\r\nnow for the first time exercised, had marked that the Lancastrians,\r\nthough strong enough to hold the barricades, had not enough men to\r\ndefend the long straggling line of houses which formed the southern\r\nextension of the town. Gathering together his repulsed retainers, he\r\nbroke into the gardens which lay behind the houses of Holywell Street,\r\nand bursting open the back-doors of several dwellings, ran out into\r\nthe main thoroughfare of the town, \"between the sign of the Chequers\r\nand the sign of the Key, blowing up his trumpets and shouting with a\r\ngreat voice, A Warwick! A Warwick!\"--a cry destined to strike terror\r\ninto Lancastrian ears on many a future battlefield. Warwick's sudden\r\nirruption took the defenders of the barricades in the rear, but they\r\nfaced about and stood to it manfully in the streets. The Lancastrian\r\nline was broken, and the Yorkist centre, where Sir Robert Ogle led on\r\nthe Duke's own followers from the Northern Marches, now burst into the\r\nmarket-place in the centre of the town to aid Warwick.\r\n\r\nFor one wild half-hour the arrows flew like sleet up and down St.\r\nPeter's Street, and the knights fought hand to hand in the narrow\r\nroadway. But the Lancastrians were overmatched. The King received\r\nan arrow in the neck, and was led bleeding into the house of a\r\ntanner. Somerset, the cause of the battle, was stricken dead on the\r\ndoorstep of an inn named the Castle. Sir Philip Wentworth, the King's\r\nstandard-bearer, threw down his banner and fled away. James of Ormond\r\nthe Irish Earl of Wiltshire, and Thorpe the Speaker of the House of\r\nCommons, followed him. But the other leaders of the King's army were\r\nless fortunate. The Earl of Northumberland and Lord Clifford were\r\nslain. The Earl of Dorset was desperately wounded, and left for dead\r\nin the street. The Duke of Buckingham, with an arrow sticking in his\r\nface, took sanctuary in the abbey. The Earls of Stafford and Devon,\r\nboth wounded, and Lord Dudley, yielded themselves prisoners. Only\r\nsixscore men had been slain in the King's army, but the larger part\r\nwere persons of mark, for, as was often the case in that century,\r\nthe lightly-equipped archers and billmen could fling down their arms\r\nand get away with ease, while the knights and nobles, fighting on\r\nfoot in their cumbrous armour, could not make speed to fly when the\r\nday was lost. So it came to pass that of the one hundred and twenty\r\nLancastrians who fell, only forty-eight were common men, the rest were\r\nnobles, knights, and squires, or officers of the King's household. On\r\nthe next day the victors marched on London, vainly hoping, perhaps,\r\nthat with the death of Somerset and the capture of the King the days of\r\nthe weak government of Lancaster were over.\r\n\r\nThe Duke and his followers thought, as yet, of nothing more than a\r\nchange of ministry. Their conduct shows that they had nothing more in\r\nhand than the replacing of the Court party in the great offices of\r\nState by persons who should be more in touch with their own views and\r\nthe will of the nation. The Chancellorship was left in the hands of\r\nArchbishop Bourchier, whom the Yorkists felt that they could trust;\r\nbut the Earl of Wiltshire was replaced as Treasurer by Lord Bourchier,\r\nthe Archbishop's brother. The Duke of York became Constable; Warwick\r\nsuperseded the dead Somerset as Captain of Calais; Salisbury was made\r\nSteward of the Duchy of Lancaster. A little later Warwick's younger\r\nbrother George Neville was given the wealthy bishopric of Exeter,\r\nthough he had only just reached his twenty-sixth year. A Parliament\r\nsummoned in July ratified these appointments, and chose as its Speaker\r\nSir John Wenlock, of whom we shall frequently hear again as one of\r\nWarwick's firmest friends and adherents. A strongly-worded oath of\r\nallegiance to King Henry was taken by the Duke of York, and all the\r\nHouse of Lords with him, and the new ministry started on its career\r\nwith favourable prospects. The only trouble for the moment came from\r\nan ill-judged attempt in Parliament to fix the responsibility for\r\nthe \"Ill Day of St. Albans\" on definite persons. Warwick named Lord\r\nCromwell as one of those most to blame, and when Cromwell gave an\r\nangry reply, there sprang up such an altercation between them that men\r\nfeared a breach of the peace. That night Cromwell borrowed the Earl of\r\nShrewsbury's men-at-arms to guard his house; but Warwick had cooled\r\ndown and no more came of the quarrel, for the Parliament very wisely\r\nconcluded to lay all the responsibility for the Civil War on Somerset,\r\nwho was dead and could not reply.\r\n\r\nYork's authority in the kingdom was made more secure for the moment\r\nwhen King Henry fell once again into one of his fits of melancholy\r\nmadness in October. The Parliament reassembled and appointed the\r\nDuke Regent, but on February 25th Henry came to his senses, and at\r\nonce relieved York of his office. There followed a time of unrest\r\nand rumours of war, but for some months longer the Duke succeeded in\r\nmaintaining his place at the helm. But trouble was always impending.\r\nWarwick, whose trained and paid soldiery in the garrison of Calais were\r\nthe only permanent military force belonging to the Crown, had to come\r\nover on several occasions to back his uncle. At one time we hear that\r\nYork feared to be waylaid on his way to Parliament, and got Warwick\r\nwith three hundred men \"all in jacks or brigandines\" to escort him\r\nthither, \"saying that if he had not come so strong he would have been\r\ndistressed, but no man knew by whom, for men think verily that there is\r\nno man able to undertake any such enterprise.\"\r\n\r\nYork was not wrong, however, in thinking that there were those who\r\nwere ready to risk much to get him out of power. Since Somerset was\r\ndead, the leadership of the Court party had fallen into very firm\r\nand determined hands, those of Margaret of Anjou, and the Queen had\r\nresolved to exercise the unbounded influence that she enjoyed over\r\nher husband to make him evict his Yorkist ministers the moment that\r\nit seemed safe so to do. For her resolve she had this much excuse,\r\nthat the new government was at first no more fortunate than the old\r\nin enforcing order in the kingdom, for into the period of York's\r\nascendency fell the worst private war that had been seen for a\r\ngeneration. Courtney Earl of Devon and Lord Bonville fell to blows\r\nin the West, and fought a battle outside Exeter with four thousand\r\nmen a side; the Earl won, and signalised his victory by ransacking\r\nthe cathedral and carrying off several of the canons as prisoners.\r\nYet he was not brought to justice for this abominable sacrilege, even\r\nthough he was of the party which was opposed to York. But Margaret\r\nwas not entitled to blame York for the state of the kingdom, for we\r\nfind that she deliberately went to work to give the Duke trouble, by\r\nstirring up foreign enemies against England. A Scotch raid in the\r\nsummer of 1456 was more than suspected to be due to her intrigues;\r\nand it is certain that while the Duke was officially taking the Scots\r\nto task in the King's name, the King was disavowing York's war-like\r\ndespatches in private letters to James the Second. When we know that a\r\nyear later Margaret was not above setting on the French to ravage the\r\nKentish sea-ports for her own private purposes, we can understand a\r\nlittle of the hatred with which she was followed by the Commons of the\r\nsouth-eastern counties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWARWICK CAPTAIN OF CALAIS AND ADMIRAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the four years which lay between the fight of St. Albans and\r\nthe second outbreak of the Civil War in 1459 that Warwick made his\r\nreputation and won his popularity. Up to 1455 he had been known merely\r\nas a capable young nobleman who followed in all things the lead of his\r\nfather Salisbury. He had not as yet been given any independent command,\r\nnor trusted alone in any business of importance, though he was already\r\nfar beyond the age at which many personages of the fifteenth century\r\nbegan to take a prominent part in politics. He was now twenty-seven\r\nyears old, eleven years older than Henry the Fifth when he took over\r\nthe government of Wales, nine years older than Edward the Fourth when\r\nhe won the fight of Mortimer's Cross. There were no signs in Warwick\r\nof that premature development which made so many of his contemporaries\r\ngrown men at sixteen, and worn-out veterans at forty.\r\n\r\nUnlike most of his house, Warwick had not been blessed with a large\r\nfamily. Anne Beauchamp had borne him two daughters only, both of\r\nthem delicate girls who did not live to see their thirtieth year. No\r\nmale offspring was ever granted him, and it seemed evident that the\r\nlands of Warwick and Despenser were destined to pass once more into\r\nthe female line. But the day was far distant when this was to be, and\r\nRichard Neville's sturdy frame and constitution,--his _altitudo animi\r\ncum paribus corporis viribus_, to quote Polidore Vergil,--promised many\r\na long year of vigorous manhood.\r\n\r\nWarwick had already become a prominent figure in English politics, not\r\nso much from the breadth of his lands or from the promise of military\r\nprowess that he had shown at St. Albans, as from the almost universal\r\npopularity which he enjoyed. He was far from being the haughty noble,\r\nthe Last of the Barons, whom later writers have drawn for us. His\r\ncontemporaries speak of him rather as the idol of the Commons and\r\nthe people's friend: \"his words were gentle, and he was affable and\r\nfamiliar with all men, and never spoke of his own advancement, but\r\nalways of the augmentation and good governance of the realm.\" There\r\nnever was any peer who was a better lord to his own retainers, nor was\r\nthere any who bore himself more kindly towards the Commons; hence he\r\nwon a personal popularity to which his father Salisbury never attained,\r\nand which even his uncle of York could not rival.\r\n\r\nAs a school for a man of action there could have been no better post\r\nthan the governorship of Calais. The place had been beset by the French\r\never since the loss of Normandy in 1450, and was never out of danger of\r\na sudden attack. Three times in the last six years considerable armies\r\nhad marched against it, and had only been turned away by unexpected\r\nevents in other quarters. Bickering with the French garrisons of\r\nBoulogne and other neighbouring places never ended, even in times of\r\nnominal truce. To cope with the enemy the Captain of Calais had a\r\ngarrison always insufficient in numbers, and generally in a state of\r\nsuppressed mutiny; for one of the chief symptoms of the evil rule of\r\nSuffolk and Somerset had been the impotence of the central government\r\nto find money for the regular war-expenses of the realm. The garrison\r\nof Calais was perpetually in arrears of pay, and successive governors\r\nare found complaining again and again that they were obliged to\r\nempty their own pockets to keep the soldiers to their post. Even the\r\ntown-walls had been allowed to fall into disrepair for want of money to\r\nmend them.\r\n\r\nBesides his military duties the Captain of Calais had other difficult\r\nfunctions. He lay on the frontier of Flanders, and a great part of\r\nthe trade between England and the dominions of the house of Burgundy\r\npassed through his town, for Calais was the \"staple\" for that branch\r\nof commerce. Hence he had to keep on good terms with the neighbouring\r\nBurgundian governors, and also--what was far more difficult--to\r\nendeavour to sweep the Straits of Dover clear of pirates and of French\r\nprivateers, whenever there was not an English fleet at sea. This was\r\nno sinecure, for of late English fleets had been rarely seen, and\r\nwhen they did appear had gone home without effecting anything useful.\r\nThe man who could with a light heart undertake to assume the post of\r\nCaptain of Calais must have been both able and self-confident.\r\n\r\nWarwick held the place from August 1455 to August 1460, and combined\r\nwith it the post of \"Captain to guard the Sea\" from October 1457 to\r\nSeptember 1459. His tenure of office was in every way successful.\r\nThe garrison was brought up to its full strength, and put in good\r\ndiscipline--largely, we may suspect, at the expense of the Earl's own\r\npocket, for after October 1456, when the Duke of York ceased to be\r\nProtector, Warwick got little money or encouragement from England.\r\nHe raised the strength of his troops to about two thousand men, and\r\nwas then able to assume the offensive against the neighbouring French\r\ngarrisons. His greatest success was when, in the spring of the third\r\nyear of his office, he led a body of eight hundred combatants on a\r\ndaring raid as far as Étaples, forty miles down the coast of Picardy,\r\nand took the town together with a fleet of wine-ships from the south of\r\nFrance, which he put up to ransom, and so raised a sum large enough to\r\npay his men for some months. Falling into a disagreement also with the\r\nBurgundian governors in Flanders, he made such havoc in the direction\r\nof Gravelines and St. Omer that Duke Philip was obliged to strengthen\r\nhis garrisons there, and finally was glad to consent to a pacification.\r\nThe negotiations were held in Calais and came to a successful\r\nconclusion, for a commercial treaty was concluded with Flanders as well\r\nas a mere suspension of arms.\r\n\r\nWhile Warwick lay at Calais he could not pay very frequent visits to\r\nEngland, for French alarms were always abounding. In June 1456, for\r\nexample, \"men said that the siege should come to Calais, for much\r\npeople had crossed the water of Somme, and great navies were on the\r\nsea.\" Again, in May 1457, another threatened attack caused the Earl\r\nto lay in great stores, for which he had to draw on Kent: \"so he had\r\nthe folks of Canterbury and Sandwich before him, and thanked them\r\nfor their good hearts in victualling of Calais, and prayed them for\r\ncontinuance therein.\" That those rumours of coming trouble were not\r\nall vain was shown a few months later, for a Norman fleet under Peter\r\nde Brézé threw four thousand men ashore near Sandwich in August, and\r\nthe French stormed the town from the land side, held it for a day, and\r\nsacked it from garret to cellar. It was this disaster which England\r\nowed to Margaret of Anjou, for she had deliberately suggested the time\r\nand place of attack to de Brézé, in order to bring discredit on the\r\ngovernment of the Duke of York.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note how the work of the day of St. Albans was undone,\r\nwithout any violent shock, during the earlier years of Warwick's rule\r\nat Calais. The Queen played her game more cautiously than usual.\r\nFirst, York's protectorate was ended, on the excuse that the King,\r\nwhose mind had failed him again after St. Albans, was now himself once\r\nmore. Then, eight months later, a great Council was summoned, not at\r\nLondon, where York was too popular, but at Coventry. The meeting was\r\npacked with the men-at-arms of the Queen's adherents, and at it King\r\nHenry dismissed the two Bourchier brothers, York's firm supporters,\r\nfrom their offices of Chancellor and Treasurer, and replaced them by\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury, a strong adherent of the Court party, and by\r\nWainfleet Bishop of Winchester. It was widely believed that York, who\r\nhad come to the Council with no knowledge of the Queen's intended\r\n_coup d'état_, would have met with an ill end if his kinsman the Duke\r\nof Buckingham had not succeeded in aiding him to escape. Of all the\r\noffices bestowed as the result of St. Albans fight, Warwick's post at\r\nCalais was the only one which was not now forfeited. Probably the Queen\r\nand her friends preferred to keep him over-sea as much as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is a good testimony to the loyalty of the Duke and his friends\r\nthat they made no stir on their eviction from office. York retired\r\nto Wigmore, and for the next year abode quietly upon his estates.\r\nSalisbury went to Middleham and remained in the North. Meanwhile the\r\ncountry showed its discontent with the renewed rule of the Queen.\r\nTumultuous gatherings took place in Oxfordshire and Berkshire, and\r\nagain on the Welsh Border, although no leading Yorkist was implicated\r\nin them. The temper of London was so discontented that the Queen would\r\nnot allow the King to approach it for a whole year.\r\n\r\nThe ascendency of the Earls of Wiltshire, Beaumont, Shrewsbury, Exeter,\r\nand the other lords who ruled in the King's name and by the Queen's\r\nguidance, proved as unfortunate and as unpopular as any of the other\r\nperiods during which Margaret's friends were at the helm. Men felt that\r\ncivil war was destined to break out once more, as soon as York should\r\nbe pressed too hard and find his patience at an end. Hence general joy\r\nwas felt when in January 1458 the King, taking the initiative for once,\r\nannounced that he was about to reconcile all the private grievances of\r\nhis lords, and invited York, Salisbury, and Warwick, with the rest of\r\ntheir party, to attend a great Council at Westminster. They came, but\r\nfearing some snare of the Queen's, came with a numerous following--York\r\nwith a hundred and forty horse, Salisbury with four hundred, Warwick\r\nwith six hundred men of the Calais garrison all apparelled in red\r\njackets emblazoned with the Beauchamp badge of the ragged staff.\r\nThere was no snare in the King's invitation, and all precautions were\r\ntaken to prevent affrays. The Yorkist lords and their retainers were\r\nlodged within the city, while the Queen's friends, who appeared in\r\ngreat force--the Earl of Northumberland alone brought three thousand\r\nmen--were provided for in the suburbs. The Mayor of London--Godfrey\r\nBulleyn, Anne Bulleyn's ancestor--with five thousand citizens arrayed\r\nin arms kept the streets, to guard against brawling between the\r\nretainers of the two parties.\r\n\r\nThe King at once set forth his purpose of a general pacification, and\r\nfound York and his friends very ready to fall in with his views. More\r\ntrouble was required to induce the sons of those who had fallen at St.\r\nAlbans--the young Somerset, Clifford, and Northumberland--to pardon\r\nthose on whose swords was their fathers' blood. But the King's untiring\r\nefforts produced the desired result. York, Salisbury, and Warwick\r\npromised to endow the Abbey of St. Albans with a sum of £45 a year,\r\nto be spent in masses for the souls of the slain, and to make large\r\nmoney payments to their heirs--York gave the young Duke of Somerset\r\nand his mother five thousand marks, and Warwick made over one thousand\r\nto the young Clifford. After this curious bargain had been made, and\r\na proclamation issued to the effect that both the victors and the\r\nvanquished of St. Albans had acted as true liegemen of the King, a\r\nsolemn ceremony of reconciliation was held. The King walked in state\r\nto St. Paul's, behind him came the Queen, led by the Duke of York;\r\nthen followed Salisbury hand in hand with Somerset, Warwick hand in\r\nhand with the Duke of Exeter, and after them their respective adherents\r\ntwo and two. The sight must have gladdened the King's kindly heart,\r\nbut no one save his own guileless self could have supposed that such a\r\nreconciliation was final; almost the whole of his train were destined\r\nto die by each other's hands. The Queen and Somerset were one day to\r\nbehead York and Salisbury; Warwick was destined to slay Exeter's son;\r\nand so all down the long procession.\r\n\r\nAs one of the tokens of reconciliation, Warwick was created \"Chief\r\nCaptain to guard the Sea,\" a post wherein centred the ambition of his\r\nunwilling partner in the great procession, the Duke of Exeter. The\r\noffice was not one with many attractions. The royal navy comprised no\r\nmore than the _Grace Dieu_ and two or three more large carracks. When\r\na fleet was required, it was made up by requisitioning hastily-armed\r\nmerchant-vessels from the maritime towns. Of late years, whenever such\r\nan array was mustered, the sailors had gone unpaid, and the command\r\nhad been entrusted to some unskilled leader from the ranks of the\r\nCourt party. England had entirely ceased to count as a naval power;\r\nher coasts were frequently ravaged by French expeditions, such as that\r\nwhich had burnt Sandwich in 1457, and pirates and privateers of all\r\nnations swarmed in the Channel.\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as Captain of Calais, Warwick had been compelled to\r\nlearn something of the Channel, but we should never have guessed that\r\nhe had accumulated enough of the seaman's craft to make him a competent\r\nadmiral. Nevertheless, his doings during the twenty months of his\r\ncommand at sea entitle him to a respectable place by the side of Blake\r\nand Monk and our other inland-bred naval heroes. He not merely acquired\r\nenough skill to take the charge of a fleet in one of the rough and\r\nready sea-fights of the day, but actually became a competent seaman.\r\nAt a pinch, as he showed a few years later, he could himself take the\r\ntiller and pilot his ship for a considerable voyage.\r\n\r\nThe tale of Warwick's first naval venture has been most fortunately\r\npreserved to us by the letter of an actor in it.\r\n\r\n On Trinity Sunday (May 28th) in the morning [writes John Jernyngan]\r\n came tidings unto my Lord of Warwick that there were twenty-eight\r\n sail of Spaniards on the sea, whereof sixteen were great ships of\r\n forecastle; and then my Lord went and manned five ships of forecastle\r\n and three carvells and four pinnaces, and on the Monday we met\r\n together before Calais at four of the clock in the morning, and fought\r\n together till ten. And there we took six of their ships, and they slew\r\n of our men about fourscore and hurt two hundred of us right sore. And\r\n we slew of them about twelvescore, and hurt a five hundred of them.\r\n It happed that at the first boarding of them we took a ship of three\r\n hundred tons, and I was left therein and twenty-three men with me. And\r\n they fought so sore that our men were fain to leave them. Then came\r\n they and boarded the ship that I was in, and there was I taken, and\r\n was prisoner with them six hours, and was delivered again in return\r\n for their men that were taken at the first. As men say, there has not\r\n been so great a battle upon the sea these forty winters. And, to say\r\n sooth, we were well and truly beaten: so my Lord has sent for more\r\n ships, and is like to fight them again in haste.\r\n\r\nSuch a hard-fought struggle against superior numbers was almost as\r\nhonorable to Warwick's courage and enterprise as a victory, and the\r\nindomitable pluck which he displayed seems to have won the hearts\r\nof the sailors, who were ever after, down to the day of his death,\r\nfaithful to his cause. But his later undertakings were fortunate as\r\nwell as bold.\r\n\r\nThe best known of them took place in the spring of 1458. Sweeping\r\nthe Channel with fourteen small vessels, Warwick came on five great\r\nships--\"three great Genoese carracks, and two Spaniards far larger and\r\nhigher than the others.\" For two days Warwick fought a running fight\r\nwith the enemy, \"hard and long, for he had no vessel that could compare\r\nin size with theirs.\" Finally he took three of the carracks and put the\r\nother two to flight. Nearly a thousand Spaniards were slain, and the\r\nprisoners were so many that the prisons of Calais could hardly contain\r\nthem. The prizes were richly laden, and their contents were valued\r\nat no less than £10,000. The markets of Calais and Kent were for the\r\nmoment so charged with Southern goods that a shilling bought that year\r\nmore than two would have bought the year before.\r\n\r\nThis fight naturally made Warwick popular with merchants and sailors,\r\nbut it was less liked at Westminster; for although at odds with the\r\nKing of Castile, England was not at this moment engaged in hostilities\r\nwith the Genoese, though there was a dispute in progress about the\r\nill-treatment of some British merchants by them. Another feat of\r\nWarwick's, however, was to get him into worse trouble. Early in the\r\nautumn of the same year he had an engagement in the Straits of Dover\r\nwith a great fleet of Hanseatic vessels from Lubeck, who were sailing\r\nsouthward to France. From them he took five ships which he brought\r\ninto Calais. Now England had signed a commercial treaty with the Hansa\r\nonly two years before, and this engagement was a flagrant violation of\r\nit. It led Warwick's enemies on the Continent to call him no better\r\nthan a pirate. What was his plea of justification we do not know. It\r\nmay be, as some have alleged, that he mistook the Germans at first\r\nfor Spaniards or Frenchmen. It may be that he fell out with them on\r\nsome question as to the rights of the English admiral in the narrow\r\nseas, such as gave constant trouble in later centuries, and were the\r\nforerunners of the famous quarrels over the \"right of search\" and \"the\r\nright of salute.\"\r\n\r\nBut about Warwick's capture of the Hanseatic vessels there was no\r\ndoubt. A month later a board was appointed, consisting of Lord Rivers,\r\nSir Thomas Kyrriel, and seven other members, to investigate the matter.\r\n\r\nOn November 8th Warwick came over from Calais to lay his defence before\r\nthe King and Council. Henry received him courteously enough, and there\r\nwas much sage talk about the marches of Picardy, \"but the Earl could\r\njudge well enough by the countenances of many who sat in the Council\r\nChamber that they bore him hatred, so that he bethought him of the\r\nwarnings that his father had lately written him about the Queen's\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nNext day when Warwick again came into the royal presence, the Council\r\nhad hardly begun when a great tumult arose in the court, \"the noise was\r\nheard over the whole palace, and every one was calling for Warwick.\"\r\nWhat had happened was, that the retainers of Somerset and Wiltshire\r\nhad fallen on the Earl's attendants and were making an end of them.\r\nWarwick ran down to see what was the matter, but the moment that he\r\nappeared in the court he was set on by a score of armed men, and it was\r\nonly by the merest chance that he was able to cut his way down to the\r\nwater-stairs, and leap with two of his men into a boat. He escaped with\r\nhis life to the Surrey side, but his followers were not so lucky; three\r\nwere slain and many wounded.\r\n\r\nWarwick declared that the whole business had been a deliberate plot to\r\nmurder him, and he was probably right; but the lords of the Queen's\r\nparty maintained that the affray had been a chance medley between the\r\ntwo bands of retainers, and that the first blow had been struck by one\r\nof Warwick's men. But whatever was the truth about the matter, Warwick\r\ncould not be blamed if he swore never to come to Court again without\r\narmed men at his heels. The sequel of the quarrel shows what had really\r\nbeen intended. Next day the Queen and her friends represented to the\r\nKing that the quarrel had been due to brawling on Warwick's part, and\r\nprocured an order for committing him to the Tower. Warned of this by\r\na secret friend in the Council, the Earl rode off in haste to Warwick\r\nCastle, and sent to his father and the Duke of York. The three held a\r\nconference, in which they resolved that at the next hostile move of\r\ntheir enemies they would repeat the line of conduct which had been so\r\nsuccessful four years before--they would muster their retainers and\r\ndeliver the King by force out of the hands of the Court party.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Warwick retired to Calais, where he called together the\r\nofficers of the garrison, and the Mayor and aldermen, set forth to\r\nthem the attempt upon his life, and begged them to be true to him and\r\nguard him against the machination of his enemies.\r\n\r\nThe next attack of the Queen on the followers of York was long in\r\ncoming; nine months elapsed between the affray at Westminster and the\r\nfinal outbreak of Civil War.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile [says the chronicler] the realm of England was out of all\r\n good governance, as it had been many days before; for the King was\r\n simple, and led by covetous counsel, and owed more than he was worth.\r\n His debts encreased daily, but payment was there none; for all the\r\n manors and lordships that pertained to the Crown the King had given\r\n away, so that he had almost nought to live on. And such impositions as\r\n were put on the people, as taxes, tallages, and 'fifteenths,' all were\r\n spent in vain, for the King held no household and maintained no wars.\r\n So for these misgovernances the hearts of the people were turned from\r\n them that had the land in governance, and their blessing was turned\r\n to cursing. The Queen and her affinity ruled the realm as they liked,\r\n gathering riches innumerable. The officers of the realm, and specially\r\n the Earl of Wiltshire, the Treasurer, for to enrich themselves pilled\r\n the poor people, and disherited rightful heirs, and did many wrongs.\r\n The Queen was sore defamed, and many said that he that was called the\r\n Prince was not the King's son, but gotten in adultery.\r\n\r\nThe name of Wiltshire, \"the best-favoured knight in the land, and the\r\nmost feared of losing his beauty,\" was united with that of Margaret\r\nby many tongues, and the Queen's behaviour was certainly curious;\r\nfor instead of staying with her husband, she was continually absent\r\nfrom his side, busied in all manner of political intrigues, and only\r\nvisiting King Henry when some grant or signature had to be wrung out\r\nof him. All the summer of 1459 she was in Lancashire and Cheshire\r\n\"allying to her the knights and squires in those parts for to have\r\ntheir benevolence, and held open household among them, and made her\r\nson give a livery blazoned with a swan to all the gentlemen of the\r\ncountry, trusting through their strength to make her son King; for she\r\nwas making privy means to some lords of England for to stir the King to\r\nresign the crown to his son; but she could not bring her purpose about.\"\r\n\r\nThe exact details of the outbreak of the war are hard to arrange\r\nchronologically. Writs were being sent about by the Queen in the King's\r\nname ordering every one to be ready to assemble \"with as many men as\r\nthey might, defensibly arrayed,\" as early as May. But no such muster\r\nseems to have taken place, and it was not till September that a blow\r\nwas struck. In the middle of that month an army was raised in the\r\nMidlands with which the King took the field. A summons was then sent to\r\nSalisbury, who lay at Sherif Hoton in his northern lands, bidding him\r\ncome to London. Remembering what had happened to his son on his last\r\nvisit to the King, Salisbury went not, but took the summons, combined\r\nwith the mustering of the King's forces, as an alarm of war. Collecting\r\nsome three thousand of his Yorkshire tenants, he marched off to seek\r\nhis brother-in-law York, who was lying at Ludlow. At the same time he\r\nsent messengers to his son at Calais, bidding him cross over at once to\r\njoin him.\r\n\r\nWarwick, seeing that the crisis was come, took two hundred men-at-arms\r\nand four hundred archers of the garrison of Calais, under Sir Andrew\r\nTrollope a veteran of the French War, and crossed to Sandwich. He left\r\nCalais, where lay his wife and his two daughters, in charge of his\r\nuncle, William Neville Lord Fauconbridge, \"a little man in stature but\r\na knight of great reverence.\" Warwick marched quietly through London,\r\nand crossed the Midlands as far as Coleshill in Warwickshire without\r\nmeeting an enemy. There he just avoided a battle, for Somerset, with\r\na great force from his Wessex lands, was marching through the town\r\nfrom south-west to north-east the same day that Warwick traversed it\r\nfrom south-east to north-west; but as it happened they neither of them\r\ncaught any sight or heard any rumour of the other.\r\n\r\nWhile Warwick was taking his way through the Midlands, decisive\r\nevents had been occurring. When the Queen, who lay at Eccleshall in\r\nStaffordshire, heard that Salisbury was on his way to York's castle\r\nof Ludlow, she called out all her new-made friends of the north-west\r\nMidlands, and bade them intercept the Earl. Lord Audley their leader\r\nwas given a commission to arrest Salisbury and send him to the Tower\r\nof London. All the knighthood of Cheshire and Shropshire came together\r\nand joined Audley, who was soon at the head of nearly ten thousand\r\nmen. With this force he threw himself across Salisbury's path at Blore\r\nHeath near Market Drayton on September 23rd. The old Earl refused to\r\nlisten to Audley's summons to surrender, entrenched himself on the\r\nedge of a wood and waited to be attacked. Audley first led two cavalry\r\ncharges against the Yorkist line, and when these were beaten back by\r\nthe arrows of the northern archers, launched a great column of billmen\r\nand dismounted knights against the enemy. After hard fighting it was\r\nrepulsed, Audley himself was slain, and the Lancastrians drew back,\r\n\"leaving dead on the field most of those notable knights and squires of\r\nChesshire that had taken the badge of the Swan.\"\r\n\r\nIn the night Salisbury drew off his men and marched round the defeated\r\nenemy, who still lay in front of his position. A curious story is told\r\nof his retreat by the chronicler Gregory. \"Next day,\" he says, \"the\r\nEarl of Salisbury, if he had stayed, would have been taken, so great\r\nwere the forces that would have been brought up by the Queen, who\r\nlay at Eccleshall only six miles from the field.\" But the enemy knew\r\nnothing of Salisbury's departure, \"because an Austin friar shot guns\r\nall night in the park at the rear of the field, so that they knew not\r\nthe Earl was departed. Next morrow they found neither man nor child\r\nin that park save the friar, and he said that it was for fear that he\r\nabode in that park, firing the guns to keep up his heart.\"\r\n\r\nSalisbury was now able to join York at Ludlow without further\r\nmolestation, and Warwick came in a few days later without having seen\r\nan enemy. The Duke and the younger Earl called out their vassals of\r\nthe Welsh March, and their united forces soon amounted to twenty\r\nthousand men. They made no hostile movement however, though the\r\nLancastrian force defeated at Blore Heath was now being joined by new\r\nreinforcements and lay opposite them in great strength. But the Duke\r\nand the two Earls went forward to Worcester, and there in the cathedral\r\ntook a solemn oath that they meant nothing against the King's estate\r\nor the common weal of the realm. They charged the Prior of Worcester\r\nand Dr. William Lynwood to lay before the King a declaration \"that they\r\nwould forbear and avoid all things that might serve to the effusion of\r\nChristian blood,\" and would not strike a blow except in self-defence,\r\nbeing only in arms to save their own lives.\r\n\r\nThe refusal of the Yorkist lords to assume the offensive, if creditable\r\nto their honesty, was fatal to their cause. For the next three weeks\r\nthe levies of Northern and Central England came pouring into the\r\nQueen's camp, and the King himself, waking up for once, assumed the\r\ncommand in person. A curious record in the preamble of an Act of\r\nParliament of this year tells us how he buckled on his armour, \"and\r\nspared not for any impediment or difficulty of way, nor intemperance\r\nof weather, but jeopardied his royal person, and continued his labour\r\nfor thirty days, and sometimes lodged in the bare field for two\r\nnights together, with all his host, in the cold season of the year,\r\nnot resting in the same place more than one night save only on the\r\nSundays.\" About October 12th, the King, whose army now amounted to as\r\nmany as fifty thousand men, pushed slowly forward on to Ludlow, putting\r\nout as he went strongly-worded proclamations which stigmatised the Duke\r\nand the Earls as traitors, and summoned their followers to disperse,\r\npromising free pardon to all save Salisbury and the others who had\r\nfought at Blore Heath.\r\n\r\nYork and Warwick had, of course, no intention of abandoning their\r\nkinsman; they paid no heed to the royal proclamation, but they soon\r\nfound that their followers were far from holding it so lightly. The\r\nYorkists were so manifestly inferior in numbers to the enemy, less\r\nthan half their force indeed, that the men's hearts were failing\r\nthem. Their position on the Welsh Border, with the King's army cutting\r\nthem off from England, and with the Welsh in arms behind them, was\r\nunsatisfactory, and none of the Yorkist barons had succeeded in joining\r\nthem except Lord Clinton and Lord Grey of Powis. The inaction of their\r\nleaders had allowed them time to think over their position, and it\r\nwould appear that the news of the King's proclamation had reached them,\r\nand the announcement of pardon worked its effect. York seems to have\r\nrecognised that the use of the royal name against him was the fatal\r\nthing, and proceeded to spread a rumour through his camp that King\r\nHenry was really dead. He even ordered his chaplains to celebrate the\r\nmass for the dead in the midst of the camp. But the stratagem recoiled\r\non his head next day, when the truth became known, and the King was\r\nseen, with his banner displayed at his side, leading forward in person\r\nthe van of the Lancastrian army. At nightfall on October 13th the\r\narmies were only separated by the Teme, then in flood and covering\r\nthe fields for some way on each side of its course. The Duke set some\r\ncannon to play upon the King's line, but the darkness or the distance\r\nkept them from doing any hurt. This was all the fighting that was\r\ndestined to take place.\r\n\r\nThat night demoralisation set in among the Yorkist ranks. It commenced\r\nwith the veteran Trollope, who secretly led off his six hundred Calais\r\ntroops from their place in the Yorkist line and joined the enemy. Lord\r\nPowis followed his example, and at dawn the whole army was melting\r\naway. York bade the bridges be broken down, and began to draw off, but\r\nnothing could keep his men together; they were dispersing with such\r\nrapidity that he could no longer hope to fight. Accordingly he bade\r\nthose who still followed him to save themselves, and made off with his\r\ntwo sons Edward and Edmund, Warwick and Salisbury, and a few devoted\r\nretainers, to seek some place of refuge.\r\n\r\nThus by the Rout of Ludford all the work of Blore Heath and St. Albans\r\nwas entirely undone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nWARWICK IN EXILE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adventures of Warwick after the army of York broke up have luckily\r\nbeen preserved to us in some detail. He and his father, together with\r\nthe Duke and his two sons Edward and Edmund, fled southwards together\r\nwith a few score of horse, hotly pursued by Sir Andrew Trollope and\r\nhis men. So close was the chase that John and Thomas Neville, who\r\nlingered behind their brother and father--both having been wounded at\r\nBlore Heath--were taken prisoners. Presently the party was forced to\r\nbreak up by the imminence of their peril. The Duke of York and his\r\nsecond son Edmund turned off into Wales, with the design of taking\r\nship for Ireland. Salisbury, Warwick, and Edward Plantagenet, the\r\nyoung Earl of March, York's eldest son and Salisbury's god-child and\r\nnephew, accompanied by Sir John Dynham and only two persons more,\r\nfled across Herefordshire by cross-roads, avoiding the towns, and\r\nthen by a hazardous journey through Gloucestershire and Somersetshire\r\nreached the coast of Devon, apparently somewhere near Barnstaple. There\r\nthe fugitives turned into a fishing village, where Sir John Dynham\r\nbought for two hundred and twenty-two nobles--the sum of the party's\r\nresources--a one-masted fishing-smack. He gave out that he was bound\r\nfor Bristol, and hired a master and four hands to navigate the little\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nWhen they had got well out from land Warwick asked the master if he\r\nknew the seas of Cornwall and the English Channel. The man answered\r\nthat he was quite ignorant of them, and had never rounded the Land's\r\nEnd. \"Then all that company was much cast down: but the Earl seeing\r\nthat his father and the rest were sad, said to them that by the favour\r\nof God and St. George he would himself steer them to a safe port. And\r\nhe stripped to his doublet, and took the helm himself, and had the sail\r\nhoisted, and turned the ship's bows westward,\" much to the disgust, we\r\ndoubt not, of the master and his four hands, who had not counted on\r\nsuch a voyage when they hired themselves to sail to Bristol town.\r\n\r\nIt was not for nothing that Warwick had ranged the Channel for two\r\nyears. He now proved that he was a competent seaman, by navigating\r\nthe little vessel down the Bristol Channel, round the Land's End, and\r\nacross to Guernsey. Here they were eight days wind-bound, but putting\r\nforth on the ninth ran safely up the Channel and came ashore at Calais\r\non November 3rd, just twenty days after the rout of Ludford. Counting\r\nthe crew, they had been eleven souls in the vessel.\r\n\r\nWarwick found Calais still safe in the hands of his uncle Fauconbridge,\r\nwhom he had left in charge of the town and of his own wife and\r\ndaughters when he went to England two months before. Overjoyed at the\r\nnews, Fauconbridge came to meet him on the quay, and fell on his neck.\r\n\"Then all those lords went together in pilgrimage to Notre Dame de St.\r\nPierre, and gave thanks for their safety. And when they came into\r\nCalais, the Mayor and the aldermen and the merchants of the Staple came\r\nout to meet them, and made them good cheer. And that night they were\r\nmerry enough, when they thought they might have found Calais already in\r\nthe hands of their enemies.\"\r\n\r\nSuch indeed might well have been their fortune, for the Duke of\r\nSomerset was already at Sandwich, with some hundreds of men-at-arms.\r\nThe King had appointed him Captain of Calais, and he was on his way\r\nto remove Fauconbridge and get the town into his own keeping. But the\r\nsouth-west wind which blew Warwick up from Guernsey had kept Somerset\r\non shore.\r\n\r\nThat very evening the wind shifted, and late at night Somerset's herald\r\nappeared before the water-gate to warn the garrison that his master\r\nwould arrive to take command next day. \"Then the guard answered the\r\nherald that they would give his news to the Earl of Warwick, who was\r\ntheir sole and only captain, and that he should have Warwick's answer\r\nin a few minutes. The herald was much abashed, and got him away, and\r\nwent back that same night to his master.\"\r\n\r\nNo one in England knew what had become of Warwick or Salisbury, and\r\nSomerset's surprise was as great as his wrath when he found that\r\nthey had anticipated him at Calais. Next morning he set sail with\r\nhis forces, of which the greater part were comprised of Sir Andrew\r\nTrollope's soldiers, making for Guisnes, with the intention of\r\nattacking Calais from the land side. But a tempest rose up while he was\r\nat sea, and though he and most of his men came ashore at Guisnes, the\r\nvessels that contained their horses and stores and armour were driven\r\ninto Calais harbour for safety, and compelled to surrender to Warwick.\r\nThe Earl \"thanked Providence for the present, and not the Duke of\r\nSomerset,\" and was much pleased at the chance, for his men were greatly\r\nin want of arms. He had the prisoners forth, and went down their ranks;\r\nthen he picked out those that had been officers under him and had sworn\r\nthe oath to him as Captain of Calais and threw them into prison, but\r\nthe rest he sent away in safety, saying that they had but served their\r\nKing to the best of their knowledge; only Lord Audley, Somerset's\r\nsecond in command, son to the peer whom Salisbury had slain at Blore\r\nHeath, was not permitted to depart, and was consigned to the castle.\r\nBut the men who had broken their oath to Warwick were brought out into\r\nthe market-place next day, and beheaded before a great concourse of the\r\ncitizens.\r\n\r\nSomerset and Sir Andrew Trollope had been received into Guisnes, and\r\nmade it their headquarters. But for some time they could do nothing\r\nagainst Calais, because they were in want of arms and horses. It was\r\nnot till they had got themselves refitted by help of the French of\r\nBoulogne that they were able to harm Warwick. Meanwhile they were\r\npractically cut off from England, for Warwick's ships held the straits,\r\nand neither news nor men came across to them. Presently Somerset set\r\nto work to intercept Warwick's supply of provisions, which was drawn\r\nmainly from Flanders, and the Earl had to arrange that every market-day\r\nparties of the garrison should ride out to escort the Flemings and\r\ntheir waggons. It might have gone hard with Calais if this source of\r\nsupply had been cut off, but Warwick had concluded a secret agreement\r\nwith Duke Philip, by which the introduction of food into the town was\r\nto be winked at by the Flemish officials, notwithstanding any treaties\r\nwith England that might exist. Neither Somerset nor Warwick got much\r\nprofit out of the continual skirmishes that resulted from the attempts\r\nof the Lancastrians to cut off the waggon-trains from Dunkirk and\r\nGravelines.\r\n\r\nSo passed the months of November and December 1459, with no stirring\r\nincidents but plenty of bickering. But Christmastide brought with it\r\nabundant excitement: the Queen had at last taken measures to reinforce\r\nSomerset, and Lord Rivers with his son Sir Antony Woodville had\r\ncome down to Sandwich with a few hundred men to take the first safe\r\nopportunity of crossing to Guisnes. But the time was stormy and the\r\ntroops mutinous; they got little or no pay, and scattered themselves\r\nover the neighbourhood to live at free quarters, so that Rivers lay in\r\nSandwich almost unattended.\r\n\r\n\"So at Christmastide the Earl called together his men-at-arms, and\r\nasked whether it was not possible to get back his great ship that he\r\nhad used when he was admiral, for it lay at Sandwich in Lord Rivers'\r\nhands with several ships more. And Sir John Dynham answered 'yea,' and\r\nswore to take it back with God's aid if the Earl would give him four\r\nhundred men to sail with him. So the Earl bade his men arm, and fitted\r\nout his vessels, and he gave the charge of the business to Sir John\r\nDynham, and Sir John Wenlock that wise knight, who had done many feats\r\nof arms in his day.\" They set out at night, and arrived off Sandwich\r\nbefore dawn. Waiting for the tide to rise, they ran into the harbour\r\nat five in the morning. No one paid any attention to them, for the men\r\nof Sandwich thought they were but timber-ships from the Baltic, as all\r\nthe men-at-arms were kept below hatches.\r\n\r\nThere was no stir in the town, and Wenlock was able to seize the ships\r\nand fit them out in haste, while Dynham swept the streets and caught\r\nLord Rivers' men-at-arms as they turned out to see what was the matter.\r\nSir Antony Woodville was captured one hour later, as he rode into the\r\ntown from London, whither he had gone to ask the Queen for a supply of\r\nmoney. Lord Rivers himself was found, still asleep, in his bed at the\r\nBlack Friars, and carried on board his own ship before he could realise\r\nwhat was happening.\r\n\r\nThe men of Sandwich, like the rest of the Kentishmen, had no desire\r\nto harm the Yorkists, so that there was no fighting, and Dynham and\r\nWenlock sailed home at their ease, without striking a single blow, with\r\ntheir prisoners and all the war-ships in the port save the _Grace Dieu_\r\nalone, which was found quite unready for the sea.\r\n\r\nThat evening they were again in Calais, and landed in triumph to\r\ndeliver their spoils to Warwick. A quaint and undignified scene\r\nfollowed when the prisoners were brought out. \"So that evening Lord\r\nRivers and his son were taken before the three Earls, accompanied by a\r\nhundred and sixty torches. And first the Earl of Salisbury rated Lord\r\nRivers, calling him a knave's son, that he should have been so rude as\r\nto call him and these other lords traitors, for they should be found\r\nthe King's true lieges when he should be found a traitor indeed. And\r\nthen my Lord of Warwick rated him, and said that his father was but\r\na squire, and that he had made himself by his marriage, and was but a\r\nmade lord, so that it was not his part to hold such language of lords\r\nof the King's blood. And then my Lord of March rated him in like wise.\r\nLastly Sir Antony was rated for his language of all three lords in the\r\nsame manner.\"\r\n\r\nIf Rivers had any sense of humour, he must have felt the absurdity of\r\nbeing rated by the Nevilles--who more than any other race in England\r\nhad risen by a series of wealthy alliances--for having \"made himself\r\nby his marriage.\" But probably anger and fear were sufficient to keep\r\nhim from any such reflections. We could wish that Warwick had been less\r\nundignified in the hour of his triumph; but if his words were rough his\r\nactions were not: Rivers and his son were sent to join Lord Audley in\r\nthe castle, but they were well treated in their captivity and came to\r\nno harm. Before many months were out they joined their captor's cause.\r\n\r\nIt would have been hard for the actors in the scene to foresee the\r\nchanges that ten years were to make in their relations to each other.\r\nBy 1470 Rivers was destined to find himself the father-in-law of the\r\nyoung Earl of March, who was now exercising his tongue against him in\r\nimitation of the Nevilles, and to lose his life in the service of the\r\nhouse of York. Warwick, on the other hand, was to become the deadly\r\nenemy of the young Prince whom he was now harbouring and training to\r\narms, and to adopt the Lancastrian cause which Rivers had deserted.\r\n\r\nThe months of January and February passed in continual skirmishing with\r\nSomerset and the garrison of Guisnes, which led to no marked result;\r\nbut about the beginning of Lent news arrived at Calais that the Duke of\r\nYork, of whom nothing definite had been heard since October, was now\r\nin great force in Ireland, where he had got possession of Dublin, \"and\r\nwas greatly strengthened by the earls and homagers of that country.\"\r\nWarwick at once resolved to sail to Ireland to concert measures with\r\nhis uncle, and to learn if it would be possible to invade England; for\r\nit was obvious that unless some vigorous offensive action were taken in\r\nthe spring, the Lancastrians would finally succeed in bringing enough\r\nmen across to form the siege of Calais, and then the town could not\r\nhold out for ever.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, though the storms of March were at their highest, Warwick\r\nequipped his ten largest ships, manned them with one thousand five\r\nhundred sailors and men-at-arms, \"the best stuff in Calais,\" and sailed\r\ndown the Channel for Ireland. The voyage was undisturbed by the enemy,\r\nbut terribly tempestuous and protracted. However, the Earl reached\r\nWaterford at last, and found there not only York and his son Rutland,\r\nbut his own mother, the Countess of Salisbury, who had fled over to\r\nIreland when she heard that her name was inserted among the list of\r\npersons attainted by the Lancastrian Parliament which met at Leicester\r\nin December 1459.\r\n\r\nWarwick found the Duke in good spirits, and so hopeful that he was\r\nready to engage to land in Wales in June with all the force that could\r\nbe raised in Ireland, if Warwick would promise to head a descent on\r\nKent at the same moment. This plan was agreed upon, and the Earl set\r\nsail to return about May 1st, taking with him his mother, who was\r\nanxious to rejoin her husband whom she had not seen for nearly a year.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news of Warwick's departure for Ireland had reached the\r\nLancastrian government, and the Duke of Exeter, Warwick's successor\r\nin the office of admiral, had sworn to prevent him from returning to\r\nCalais. Accordingly Exeter \"with the great ship called the _Grace\r\nDieu_, and three great carracks, and ten other ships all well armed and\r\nordered,\" was now besetting the Channel. When Warwick was off Start\r\nPoint the vessel which sailed in advance of his squadron to reconnoitre\r\nthe way returned in haste, with the news that a squadron was lying off\r\nDartmouth and that some fishing-boats, with whom communication had been\r\nheld, reported the Duke of Exeter to be in command.\r\n\r\nWarwick was resolved to fight, though the enemy was considerably\r\nsuperior in force. He sent for his captains on board his carvel \"and\r\nprayed that they would serve him loyally that day, for he had good\r\nhope that God would give him the victory,\" to which they answered that\r\nthey were well disposed enough for a fight and that the men were in\r\ngood heart. Accordingly the Earl's ten ships formed line and bore down\r\non the Duke's fourteen. A fight appeared imminent, when suddenly the\r\nwhole Lancastrian fleet went about, and fled in disorder into Dartmouth\r\nharbour, which lay just behind them. This unexpected action was caused\r\nby mutiny on board. When the Duke had given orders to prepare for\r\naction, his officers had come to him in dismay, to announce that the\r\nmen would not arm to fight their old commander, and that if he came\r\nany nearer to the Earl, the crews would undoubtedly rise and deliver\r\nthem over to the enemy. Accordingly Exeter gave orders to retire into\r\nharbour.\r\n\r\nWarwick, however, could not know of the cause of the enemy's retreat,\r\nand having a good west wind behind him and a great desire to get back\r\nto Calais, from which he had now been absent more than ten weeks,\r\npursued his journey without attempting anything against Dartmouth. He\r\nreached Calais in safety on June 1st, and was proud to restore his\r\nmother, \"who had suffered grievously from the sea during her voyage,\"\r\nto his father's arms. Salisbury and Fauconbridge had been much alarmed\r\nat the length of his absence, and the more faint-hearted of the\r\ngarrison had begun to murmur that he had deserted them for good, and\r\nhad fled to foreign parts to save his own person.\r\n\r\nNow, however, all was stir and bustle in Calais, for Salisbury and\r\nFauconbridge thoroughly approved of the plan of invasion which had\r\nbeen concerted at Dublin. The news from England indeed was all that\r\ncould be desired. The reckless attainting of all the Yorkists by the\r\nParliament of Leicester had met with grave disapproval. The retainers\r\nof the Lancastrian lords had been committing all sorts of misdoings,\r\nchief among which was the unprovoked sack of the town of Newbury by the\r\nfollowers of Ormond Earl of Wiltshire. London was murmuring savagely at\r\nthe execution of seven citizens who, in company with a gentleman of the\r\nhouse of Neville, had been caught in the Thames on their way to Calais\r\nto join the Earls. The \"unlearned preachers\" whom the Government put up\r\nto preach against York at Paul's Cross were hooted down by the mob. The\r\nCommons of Kent were signifying in no doubtful terms their willingness\r\nto join the Earls, the moment that the banner of the White Rose should\r\nbe unfurled in England. A fragment of a ballad hung by an unknown hand\r\non the gate of Canterbury in June is worth quoting as an expression of\r\ntheir feelings.\r\n\r\n Send home, most gracious Jesu most benigne,\r\n Send home the true blood to his proper vein,\r\n Richard Duke of York thy servant insigne,\r\n Whom Satan not ceaseth to set at disdain,\r\n But by thee preserved he may not be slain.\r\n Set him 'ut sedeat in principibus' as he did before,\r\n And so to our new song Lord thyne ear incline,\r\n Gloria, laus et honor tibi sit Christe redemptor!\r\n\r\n Edward the Earl of March, whose fame the earth shall spread,\r\n Richard Earl of Salisbury, named Prudence,\r\n With that noble knight and flower of manhood\r\n Richard Earl of Warwick, shield of our defence,\r\n Also little Faulconbridge, a knight of grete reverence,\r\n Jesu! restore them to the honour they had before!\r\n\r\nNor was it only the Commons that were ready to join in a new appeal\r\nto arms. The partisans of York among the great houses, who had not\r\ndefinitely committed themselves at the time of the rout of Ludford,\r\nand so had escaped arrest and attainder, let it be known at Calais\r\nthat they were ready for action. Chief among them were the Duke of\r\nNorfolk and the two brothers Lord Bourchier and Bourchier Archbishop of\r\nCanterbury, who pledged themselves to put their retainers in motion the\r\nmoment that Warwick should cross the sea.\r\n\r\nIt was in no spirit of recklessness then that Warwick resolved to cross\r\ninto Kent in the last week of June, with every man that could be spared\r\nfrom Calais. As a preliminary to his advance, he had resolved to clear\r\naway the only Lancastrian force that was watching him--a body of five\r\nhundred men-at-arms which had been sent down to Sandwich, to replace\r\nLord Rivers' troops and to endeavour to communicate with Somerset\r\nat Guisnes. This body was commanded by Osbert Mundeford, one of the\r\nofficers of the Calais garrison who had deserted Warwick in company\r\nwith Sir Andrew Trollope.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, on June 25th Sir John Dynham, the captor of Rivers, sailed\r\nover to Sandwich for the second time, and fell on Mundeford's force.\r\nThere was a hot skirmish, for on this occasion the Lancastrians were\r\nnot caught sleeping; but again the Yorkists won the day. Dynham indeed\r\nwas wounded by a shot from a bombard, but his men stormed the town,\r\nrouted the enemy, and took Mundeford prisoner. He was sent over to\r\nCalais, where he was tried for deserting his captain, as the prisoners\r\nof November 3rd had been, and beheaded next day outside the walls.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th Warwick himself, his father, the Earl of March, Lord\r\nFauconbridge, Wenlock, and the rest of the leaders at Calais, crossed\r\nover to Sandwich with two thousand men in good array, leaving in the\r\ntown the smallest garrison that could safely be trusted with the duty\r\nof keeping out Somerset. They had published before their landing a\r\nmanifesto, which set out the stereotyped Yorkist grievances once\r\nmore--the weak government, the crushing taxes, the exclusion of the\r\nKing's relatives from his Council, the diversion of the revenue into\r\nthe pockets of the courtiers, the misdoings of individual Lancastrian\r\nchiefs, the oppression of the King's lieges, and all the other\r\ncustomary complaints.\r\n\r\nThe three Earls had only been in Sandwich a few hours when, as had been\r\nagreed, the Archbishop of Canterbury came to join them with many of\r\nthe tenants of the see arrayed in arms. They then moved forward, with\r\nnumbers increasing at every step, for the Kentishmen came to meet them\r\nby thousands, and no one raised a hand against them.\r\n\r\nThe Lancastrians had been caught wholly unprepared. They seem to have\r\nbeen expecting raids from Warwick on the eastern coast, not on the\r\nsouthern, and except Mundeford's routed force there was no one in arms\r\nsouth of the Thames. The King and Queen were at Coventry, and most of\r\nthe Lancastrian lords scattered each in their own lands. Lord Scales\r\nand Lord Hungerford were in command of London, where there were present\r\na few other notables--Lord Vesey, Lord Lovell, and John de Foix titular\r\nEarl of Kendal. These leaders endeavoured to fortify the city, posting\r\nguns on London Bridge and placing their retainers in the Tower. But\r\nthe aspect of the citizens was threatening, and Warwick was known to\r\nbe coming on fast. The landing had taken place on the 27th, and on\r\nJuly 1st the three Earls and the Archbishop of Canterbury were already\r\nbefore the walls of London. They had marched over seventy miles in four\r\ndays, taking the route of Canterbury, Rochester, and Dartford, and were\r\nat hand long before they were expected.\r\n\r\nWhen the Archbishop's herald summoned the town there was some attempt\r\nmade by the Lancastrian lords to offer resistance, but the mob rose and\r\ndrove them into the Tower, while a deputation of aldermen went forth to\r\noffer a free entry to the Yorkist army.\r\n\r\nOn July 2nd the three Earls entered London in state, conducted by the\r\nArchbishop and a Papal Legate, a certain Bishop of Teramo who had been\r\nsent by Pius the Second to endeavour to reconcile the English factions\r\nand to get them to join in a crusade. He had allowed himself to be\r\ntalked over by Warwick, and did all in his power to further the cause\r\nof York.\r\n\r\nThe Earls rode to St. Paul's and there before a great multitude, both\r\nclerical and lay, Warwick \"recited the cause of their coming in to\r\nthe land, how they had been put out from the King's presence with\r\ngreat violence, so that they might not come to his Highness to excuse\r\nthemselves of the accusations laid against them. But now they were come\r\nagain, by God's mercy, accompanied by their people, for to come into\r\nhis presence, there to declare their innocence, or else to die upon\r\nthe field. And there he made an oath upon the Cross of Canterbury,\r\nthat they bore true faith and liegeance to the King's person, whereof\r\nhe took Christ and His Holy Mother and all the Saints of Heaven to\r\nwitness.\" We shall see that this last promise was not an entirely\r\nunmeaning formula in Warwick's mouth, and that his oath was not like\r\nthe deliberate perjuries to which others of his contemporaries--notably\r\nEdward the Fourth--were prone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nVICTORY AND DISASTER--NORTHAMPTON AND ST. ALBANS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the arrival of the three Earls in London was known, all the\r\nYorkist peers who were within touch of London came flocking in with\r\ntheir retainers. Thither came Warwick's uncle Edward Neville Lord\r\nAbergavenny, and his brother George Neville Bishop of Exeter, and his\r\ncousin Lord Scrope, and Clinton one of the victors of St. Albans, and\r\nBourchier and Cobham and Say, and the Bishops of Ely, Salisbury, and\r\nRochester. It is strange to read that Audley, who had been Warwick's\r\nprisoner in Calais ever since last November, also joined the Yorkists\r\nin arms. He had come to terms with his captor, and had agreed to forget\r\nthe death of his father at Blore Heath and to serve the cause of\r\nYork. In a few days an army of more than thirty thousand men had been\r\ngathered together.\r\n\r\nThe first task of the Yorkists was to provide for the blockade of the\r\nTower of London, where Hungerford and Scales abode in great wrath,\r\n\"shooting wild-fire into the town every hour, and laying great ordnance\r\nagainst it.\" Salisbury agreed to remain in charge of the city and to\r\nundertake the siege. With him were left Lord Cobham, Sir John Wenlock,\r\nand the greater part of the levy of London, commanded by the Lord\r\nMayor and by one Harrow, a mercer. They brought batteries to bear on\r\nthe Tower from the side of St. Katherine's wharf, \"so they skirmished\r\ntogether daily, and much harm was done.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Warwick and the young Earl of March set out on Saturday\r\nJuly 5th, having with them the other Yorkist lords, \"and much people\r\nout of Kent, Sussex, and Essex with much great ordnance.\" Marching by\r\nthe great north road, past St. Albans and Towcester, they made for\r\nNorthampton, where they heard that the King was collecting his host.\r\n\r\nThe invasion of England had been so sudden and its success so rapid\r\nthat the Lancastrians had not had time to call in all their strength,\r\nmore especially as it lay to a great extent in the extreme North and\r\nWest. But the Midlands were well roused, and, if a Yorkist chronicler\r\nis to be believed, the Queen \"had it proclaimed in Cheshire and\r\nLancashire that if so the King had the victory of the Earls, then\r\nevery man should take what he might, and make havoc in Kent, Essex,\r\nMiddlesex, Surrey, and Sussex.\" The Duke of Buckingham had the chief\r\ncommand, though he was not of the Court party nor a great lover of\r\nthe Queen's, but out of sheer loyalty he now--as formerly at St.\r\nAlbans--came out with all his retainers when he received the King's\r\nmissive. With him were Egremont and Beaumont, both deadly enemies of\r\nthe Nevilles and favourites of the Queen, the Earl of Shrewsbury, Lord\r\nGrey de Ruthyn, and many more. Their forces, though very considerable,\r\nwere still somewhat inferior to those of the Yorkists.\r\n\r\nThe King's camp was pitched just outside Northampton town, in the\r\nmeadows south of the Nen, near the Nunnery between Sandiford and\r\nHardingstone. The position had been strongly entrenched, and the\r\nearthworks were lined with a numerous artillery; the river covered both\r\nflanks, the lines being drawn from point to point in a broad bend of\r\nits course.\r\n\r\nWarwick, in accordance with his declaration at St. Paul's on the\r\nprevious Thursday, made three separate attempts to secure permission to\r\napproach the King's person; but Buckingham sternly refused to listen to\r\nhis envoys, the Bishops of Rochester and Salisbury. \"You came here not\r\nas bishops to treat of peace, but as men-at-arms,\" he said, pointing\r\nto the squadrons arrayed under the bishops' banners in the Yorkist\r\nhost. Negotiations were fruitless, and at two in the afternoon Warwick\r\ndrew out his army on the rising ground by the old Danish camp, the\r\nHunsborough, which overlooks the water-meadows, and descended to the\r\nattack. Fauconbridge led the vanguard on the left, the Earl himself the\r\ncentre, Edward of March, now seeing his first stricken field, conducted\r\nthe right wing. Before the attack it was proclaimed that every man\r\nshould spare the Commons, and slay none but the knights and lords, with\r\nwhom alone lay the blame for the shedding of all the blood that might\r\nfall that day.\r\n\r\nThe first assault on the Lancastrian lines failed completely. The\r\nobstacles were far greater than Warwick had imagined; it was six\r\nfeet from the bottom of the ditch to the top of the rampart, and the\r\ntrenches were full of water, for it had rained heavily in the morning.\r\nHow the day would have gone if treachery had not come to the succour\r\nof the Yorkists it is impossible to say; but only a few minutes after\r\nthe first gun had been fired, Lord Grey de Ruthyn on the Lancastrian\r\nleft mounted the badge of the Ragged Staff, and his men were seen\r\nbeckoning to the Yorkists to approach, and leaning over the rampart to\r\nreach their hands to pull them up. Assisted in this way, the Earl of\r\nMarch's column got within the entrenchments, and sweeping along their\r\nfront cleared a space for Warwick to burst in. All was over in half\r\nan hour and with very little bloodshed. Only three hundred men fell,\r\nbut among them were nearly all the Lancastrian leaders. On foot and in\r\ntheir heavy armour the lords and knights could not get away. The aged\r\nBuckingham fell at the door of his own tent, and Beaumont, Egremont,\r\nand Shrewsbury close to the King's quarters, as they strove to protect\r\nhis retreat. But the King, helpless as ever, was too late to fly, and\r\nfell into the hands of an archer named Henry Montford. His capture,\r\nhowever, was not so important so long as his wife and child remained\r\nat large; and Margaret--as adroit as her husband was shiftless--was\r\nalready speeding away with the young Prince, bound for North Wales.\r\n\r\nWarwick and March conducted King Henry back with all respect to London,\r\nwhere he was lodged in the palace at Westminster. They had done their\r\nwork so rapidly that they had not needed the assistance of the Duke\r\nof York, whose arrival from Ireland--he was two months later than his\r\npromise--was just announced from the West. Even before he appeared the\r\nvictors of Northampton had begun to reconstitute the King's ministry.\r\nHenry was made to sign patents appointing Salisbury Lieutenant in the\r\nsix northern counties; his son, George Bishop of Exeter, received\r\nthe Chancellorship; John Neville another son was made the King's\r\nChamberlain, and Lord Bourchier got the Treasury. Warwick himself was\r\nre-established _de jure_ in the position he had been so long holding\r\n_de facto_, the captainship of Calais.\r\n\r\nThe garrison of the Tower of London surrendered nine days after the\r\nbattle of Northampton. Most of the defenders went away in safety, but\r\nLord Scales, who was much hated by the populace of London, was not\r\nso fortunate. He took boat for the sanctuary of Westminster, but was\r\nrecognised as he rowed along by some water-men, who gave chase to him\r\nand slew him on the river \"just under the river wall of Winchester\r\nHouse.\" His body was stripped and thrown ashore into the cemetery of\r\nSt. Mary Overy, whence it was removed and honourably buried by the\r\nEarls of March and Warwick that night. \"Great pity was it that so noble\r\na knight, so well approved in the wars of France and Normandy, should\r\ndie so mischievously,\" adds the chronicler.\r\n\r\nA Parliament was summoned by the Yorkists to meet on October 9th.\r\nMeanwhile Warwick was well employed. When August came round he ran\r\nacross to Calais to see to his old antagonist at Guisnes. Somerset\r\nwas now in low spirits, and willingly met the Earl at Newnham Bridge,\r\nthere to be reconciled to him and make peace. But after he had embraced\r\nWarwick and assented to all his conditions, he secretly departed\r\nwith his follower Trollope, fled through Picardy to Dieppe, and took\r\nrefuge in his own south-western county. Meanwhile the Earl conducted\r\nhis mother and wife in great state back to London, and re-established\r\nthem in their old dwelling of \"the Harbour.\" He spent September in\r\ngoing on a pilgrimage with the Countess to the shrine of the Virgin at\r\nWalsingham in Norfolk. On this journey he ran great peril, for Lord\r\nWilloughby, an unreconciled Lancastrian, lay in wait for him near\r\nLichfield on his return, and was within an ace of making him prisoner.\r\n\r\nSo Warwick came at last to his own Midland estates. And there all the\r\nknights and ladies of his lands came to him \"complaining of the evils\r\nthat they had suffered in the past year from the Duke of Somerset, who\r\nhad pilled and robbed them, and sacked their towns and manors, and\r\nusurped the Earl's castles; but notwithstanding all their troubles they\r\npraised Heaven for the joyous return of their lord.\"\r\n\r\nYork had reached Chester early in September, and had marched slowly\r\nthrough his estates in the Welsh March towards London. When he came\r\nto Abingdon \"he sent for trompeteres and claryners from London, and\r\ngave them banners with the royal arms of England without distinction\r\nor diversity, and commanded his sword to be borne upright before him,\r\nand so he rode till he came to the gates of the palace of Westminster.\"\r\nThis assumption of royal state was the beginning of evils.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Parliament was already sitting before the Duke's arrival.\r\nKing Henry opened it with due solemnity, and heard it commence its work\r\nby repealing all the Acts of the Lancastrian Parliament of Leicester,\r\nand by removing the attainders of the Yorkist lords. On the third day\r\nof the session, Richard of York came up in the evening, and entered the\r\npalace, where he rudely took possession of the royal apartments. \"He\r\nhad the doors broken open, and King Henry hearing the great noise gave\r\nplace, and took him another chamber that night.\"\r\n\r\nThis unceremonious eviction of his sovereign was only the beginning of\r\nthe Duke's violent conduct. Next morning he went to the House of Lords,\r\nand approaching the throne laid his hand on the cushion as if about\r\nto take formal possession of the seat. Archbishop Bourchier asked him\r\nwhat he would do, and the Duke then made a lengthy reply \"challenging\r\nand claiming the realm and crown of England as male heir of King\r\nRichard the Second, and proposing without any delay to be crowned on\r\nAll Hallows' Day then following.\" The lords listened with obvious\r\ndisapproval and dismay, and York did not even venture to seat himself\r\non the throne. The meeting broke up without further transaction of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n\"Now when the Earl of Warwick, who had not been present that day, heard\r\nthis, he was very wroth, and sent for the Archbishop and prayed him to\r\ngo to the Duke and tell him that he was acting evilly, and to remind\r\nhim of the many promises he had made to King Henry.\" Warwick in short\r\nremembered his oath of July 4th, and was determined that Henry should\r\nnot be despoiled of his throne, but only placed in the hands of Yorkist\r\nministers. The Archbishop refused to face the Duke.\r\n\r\n Then the Earl sent for his brother Thomas Neville, and entered into\r\n his barge, and rowed to the palace. It was all full of the Duke's\r\n men-of-arms, but the Earl stayed not, and went straight to the Duke's\r\n chamber, and found him standing there, leaning against a side-board.\r\n And there were hard words between them, for the Earl told him that\r\n neither the lords nor the people would suffer him to strip the King of\r\n his crown. And as they wrangled, the Earl of Rutland came in and said\r\n to his cousin, \"Fair sir be not angry, for you know that we have the\r\n true right to the crown, and that my Lord and Father here must have\r\n it.\" But the Earl of March his brother stayed him and said, \"Brother,\r\n vex no man, for all shall be well.\" But the Earl of Warwick would stay\r\n no longer when he understood his uncle's intent, and went off hastily\r\n to his barge, greeting no one as he went save his cousin of March.\r\n\r\nNext day, when his wrath had cooled down, the Earl sent to his uncle\r\nthe Bishops of Ely and Rochester, Lord Audley, and a London citizen\r\nnamed Grey, to beg and beseech him to give up his enterprise. The Duke\r\nsent them away, with the answer that he would be crowned the very next\r\nMonday, the day of the translation of St. Edward the Confessor (October\r\n13th). The preparations for the coronation were actually made, and the\r\ncrowd was mustering in the Abbey, when on a last appeal made by Sir\r\nThomas Neville in the name of his brother and of all the lords and\r\ncommonalty of England, the Duke wavered. Fearing to offend his greatest\r\nsupporters beyond redemption he temporised, put off his coronation, and\r\nbegan to negotiate.\r\n\r\nRichard Neville, in fact, had matched his will against that of\r\nhis imperious uncle and had won. The Duke was never crowned. The\r\narrangement at which the parties arrived was that Henry should be King\r\nfor life, that York should be made Protector, named Prince of Wales,\r\nDuke of Cornwall, and Earl of Chester, and should be acknowledged\r\nas heir to the crown. The Duke, on the other hand, swore to be\r\nfaithful to the King so long as he should live. On All Saints' Day\r\nthe agreement was solemnly ratified at St. Paul's, whither the lords\r\nwent in procession, Warwick bearing the sword before the King, and\r\nEdward of March bearing the King's mantle. \"And the crowd shouted\r\n'Long live King Henry and the Earl of Warwick,' for the said Earl had\r\nthe good voice of the people, because he knew how to give them fair\r\nwords, showing himself easy and familiar with them, for he was very\r\nsubtle at gaining his ends, and always spoke not of himself but of the\r\naugmentation and good governance of the kingdom, for which he would\r\nhave spent his life: and thus he had the goodwill of England, so that\r\nin all the land he was the lord who was held in most esteem and faith\r\nand credence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of Parliament which recorded the agreement of York and King\r\nHenry made no mention of Queen Margaret or of the Prince her son. But\r\nit was of little use passing Acts of Parliament while she was at large\r\nand the Lancastrian lords of the North and West unsubdued. Margaret's\r\nfirst move had been to stir up the Scots, and at her bidding James the\r\nSecond crossed the Border and laid siege to Roxburgh, which was then an\r\nEnglish town. Fauconbridge, Warwick's uncle, was sent north to defend\r\nthe place, but later events deprived him of aid from England, and he\r\nwas forced to surrender, though not till after the King of Scots had\r\nfallen, slain by the bursting of one of his own siege guns.\r\n\r\nBut the Scotch invasion was only one of Margaret's schemes. Her main\r\nhope lay in a rising of the Lancastrians who had not suffered at\r\nNorthampton; and from her retreat at Harlech in North Wales she sent\r\nto summon them together. Their mustering-place was in the North,\r\nwhere the Earl of Northumberland and Lord Neville, brother of Ralph\r\nEarl of Westmoreland, and Clifford son of the Clifford who fell at\r\nSt. Albans, united their retainers as the nucleus of an army. To\r\nthem fled Somerset, regardless of his oath at Calais, and Exeter the\r\nlate Admiral, and Courtney Earl of Devon, and Willoughby and Roos and\r\nHungerford, and many more.\r\n\r\nThe danger was so imminent that the Duke of York, after wearing the\r\nhonours of the protectorate for no more than three weeks, resolved\r\nto march north and disperse the gathering of the Queen's friends. He\r\ntook with him his second son Edmund of Rutland, a boy of seventeen;\r\nSalisbury accompanied him, and he also left his first-born at home and\r\nwent out with his fourth son Thomas Neville. The Duke and the Earl\r\nraised about six thousand men, and proceeded on their way, unopposed\r\nsave by a small Lancastrian force which they beat at Worksop, till\r\nthey reached Sandal Castle, one of York's family strongholds, close\r\nbeside the town of Wakefield. When they arrived there, about Christmas\r\nEve, they learnt that the Queen's army was much stronger than they\r\nhad reckoned, and sent south for reinforcements. But on December 30th\r\nthey were themselves assailed by forces tripling their own small host,\r\nunder Somerset and Clifford. The Duke rashly fought in the open, though\r\nmany of his men were scattered over the country-side foraging. It is\r\nsaid that he relied on help treacherously promised him by some of the\r\nLancastrian leaders; but he was disappointed. No one played for his\r\nbenefit the part that Grey de Ruthyn had carried out at Northampton.\r\n\r\nThe defeat of the Yorkists was decisive. Two thousand two hundred men\r\nout of their five thousand were slain. The fate of war fell heavily\r\non the leaders, hardly one of whom escaped. The Duke fell on the\r\nfield, with Thomas Neville and William Lord Harington. The Earl of\r\nRutland, \"the best-disposed young gentleman in England,\" was slain in\r\nthe pursuit as he fled across Wakefield Bridge. Salisbury's fate was\r\nmore unhappy still; he was taken prisoner, and beheaded next day at\r\nPontefract by the Bastard of Exeter, \"though he offered great sums of\r\nmoney that he should have grant of his life.\" The heads of Salisbury\r\nand his son, of Harington, and of five knights, were set on spikes over\r\nthe gate of York, with that of Duke Richard in the midst, crowned with\r\na paper crown in mockery of the prospective kingship that he had never\r\nenjoyed.\r\n\r\nAll the Lancastrians of the North and the Midlands rose at once to join\r\nthe Queen. She was soon at the head of forty thousand men, largely\r\ncomposed of the lawless moss-troopers of the Scotch Border, who looked\r\nupon war as a mere excuse for raids, and boasted that everything beyond\r\nthe Trent was in an enemy's country. Before moving south they harried\r\nmost thoroughly the estates of the northern Yorkists. Salisbury's\r\npatrimony about Middleham and Sherif Hoton bore the brunt of the\r\nplunder, at the hands of the retainers of the elder branch of Neville,\r\nwhose head, Earl Ralph of Westmoreland, put his men under the charge\r\nof his brother Thomas, one of the most rabid Lancastrians in the North\r\nCountry.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of January the Queen's army began to roll southward,\r\npillaging recklessly on all sides, and sacking from roof to cellar\r\nthe towns of Grantham, Stamford, Peterborough, Huntingdon, Royston,\r\nMelbourn, and Dunstable, as they passed down the Ermine Street.\r\n\r\nThe news of the battle of Wakefield reached London about January 5th,\r\nand set the whole South Country in dismay. Warwick, who had been\r\nkeeping his Christmas on his own estates, was forced to ride up to\r\nthe capital at full speed, and assume the direction of affairs, for\r\nthere was now no one to share the responsibility with him. His uncle,\r\nin whose cause he had fought so long, and his father, whose prudent\r\ncounsels had guided the party, were both gone; his cousin of March, the\r\nhead of the family, was no more than nineteen years of age, and was\r\nmoreover at this moment far away by the Severn, looking after the Welsh\r\nMarch. It devolved on Warwick to assume the responsibility for the\r\ngovernment of the kingdom and the safety of the Yorkist party.\r\n\r\nThough there were traitors enough ready to change to the winning\r\nside, as was always the case in this unhappy war, the south-eastern\r\ncounties were firm to York even in the darkest hour. Warwick found\r\nready assistants in the Duke of Norfolk, the Archbishop of Canterbury,\r\nthe Earl of Arundel, the Lords Bonville, Cobham, Fitzwalter, and the\r\nCommons of Kent and London. \"In this country,\" wrote a partisan of\r\nYork, \"every man is well willing to go with my Lords here, and I hope\r\nGod shall help them, for the people of the North rob and steal, and are\r\nappointed to pillage all this country, and give away men's goods and\r\nlivelihood in all the South Country, and that shall be a mischief.\"\r\n\r\nTo resist the advance of the Queen on London, Warwick marched out to\r\nSt. Albans and arrayed some thirty thousand men to cover the London\r\nroad. His army was drawn up not in the great masses which were usual\r\nat this time, but in detachments scattered along a front of three\r\nmiles; the right on a heath called No Man's Land, the left in St.\r\nAlbans town. The country-side was full of woods and hedges, which\r\nwere manned by archers, supported by a body of Burgundian handgun-men\r\nwhom Warwick had hired in Flanders. King Henry was taken along with\r\nthe army, and stationed in the rear, in charge of Lord Bonville. The\r\nposition was strong, but the communication between its various parts\r\nwas bad, and the whole force of Warwick's men seems to have been ill\r\nplaced for concentration. Owing to some mismanagement of the officer\r\ncommanding the mounted scouts, the Lancastrians attacked before they\r\nwere expected. \"The Queen's men were at hands with the Earl's in the\r\ntown of St. Albans while all things were set to seek and out of order,\r\nfor the prickers came not home to bring tidings that the Queen was at\r\nhand, save one, and he came and said that she was yet nine mile off.\"\r\nThe first Lancastrian attack on the left, in St. Albans town, was\r\nbeaten back, but in another part of the field a fatal disaster took\r\nplace. A Kentish squire named Lovelace, who led a company in the right\r\nwing, went over to the enemy, and let the Lancastrians through the\r\nYorkist line. King Henry was captured by his wife's followers \"as he\r\nsat under a great oak, smiling to see the discomfiture of the army.\"\r\nWhen the news ran along the front that treachery was at work, and that\r\nthe King was taken, the bulk of the Yorkists broke up and fled. Not\r\nmore than three thousand were slain or taken, but the whole force was\r\nirretrievably scattered, and the greater part of the leaders fled home\r\nto their own lands as if the war was over.\r\n\r\nQueen Margaret showed her joy at the recovery of her husband's person\r\nby an exhibition of savage cruelty. Lord Bonville and Sir Thomas\r\nKyrriel, who had been in charge of Henry and had been captured with\r\nhim, were brought before her. \"So she told them they must die, and sent\r\nfor her son the Prince of Wales, and said that he should choose what\r\ndeath they should suffer. And when the boy--he was eight years old--was\r\nbrought into the tent, she said 'Fair son, what manner of death shall\r\nthese knights, whom you see here, die?' And the young child answered\r\n'Let them have their heads taken off.' Then said Sir Thomas, 'May God\r\ndestroy those who taught thee this manner of speech,' but immediately\r\nthey drew them out and cut off both their heads\" (February 17th, 1461).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTOWTON FIELD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dispersion of the Yorkist army seems to have been so complete that\r\nWarwick could not gather together more than four or five thousand of\r\nthe thirty thousand men who had stood in line at St. Albans. With\r\nthis small force he considered himself unable to protect London, and\r\nhe therefore retreated not southward but westward, intending to fall\r\nback on his own Midland estates, to raise fresh troops, and join the\r\nEarl of March in the west. He only sent to London to order that his\r\nyoung cousins George and Richard of York--now boys of eleven and nine\r\nrespectively--should be sent over-sea to take refuge in Flanders.\r\n\r\nAccordingly Warwick now marched by vile cross-country roads, and in the\r\nworst days of a February which was long remembered for its rains and\r\ninundations, across Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire to Chipping Norton.\r\nHere he met with the Earl of March, whose proceedings during the last\r\nmonth require a word of notice.\r\n\r\nEdward was at Gloucester when the news of Wakefield reached him, and\r\nsaw at once that troops must be raised to help Warwick to defend\r\nLondon. Accordingly he moved into the Welsh Marches, and hastily\r\ncalled together some ten or eleven thousand men. With these he would\r\nhave marched east, if it had not been that Mid Wales had risen in\r\nbehalf of Queen Margaret, and that he himself was beset by forces\r\nheaded by Jasper Earl of Pembroke, Jasper's father Owen Tudor, the\r\nhusband of the Queen Dowager, and James Earl of Wiltshire. Before\r\nhe could move to succour Warwick, he must free himself from these\r\nadversaries in his rear. The campaign in the West was short and\r\nsharp. The Earl of March met the Welsh at Mortimer's Cross, in north\r\nHerefordshire near Wigmore, on February 2nd, and gave them a crushing\r\ndefeat. Owen Tudor was taken prisoner and beheaded, and his head was\r\nset on the highest step of the market-cross at Hereford. \"And a mad\r\nwoman combed his hair and washed away the blood from his face, and got\r\ncandles, and set them about the head burning, more than a hundred, no\r\none hindering her.\" The Earls of Pembroke and Wiltshire escaped, and\r\njoined Queen Margaret with the wrecks of their army.\r\n\r\nThe moment that he had crushed the Welsh Lancastrians and settled the\r\naffairs of the March, Edward had set out for London, hoping to arrive\r\nin time to aid Warwick. He could not achieve the impossible, but he had\r\npassed the Severn, crossed the bleak Cotswolds, and reached Chipping\r\nNorton by February 22nd. Having left some of his troops behind in\r\nWales, he had not more than eight or nine thousand of his Marchmen with\r\nhim, under Hastings--destined one day to be the victim of Richard of\r\nGloucester--Sir John Wenlock, and William Herbert the future Earl of\r\nPembroke.\r\n\r\nThe news that reached Warwick and the Earl of March at Chipping Norton\r\nwas so startling that it caused them to change their whole plan of\r\noperations, and to march straight upon London, instead of merely\r\ngathering fresh strength to make head in a new campaign in the west\r\nMidlands.\r\n\r\nThe course of events after the fight of St. Albans had been exactly the\r\nreverse of what might have been expected from the Queen's fiery temper\r\nand the reckless courage of the Northern bands that followed her.\r\n\r\nThe battle had been fought upon February 17th, the troops of Warwick\r\nhad retired westward on the 18th, the victorious army was within\r\nthirteen miles of London, and there was nothing to prevent the Queen\r\nfrom entering the city next day. It is one of the most curious problems\r\nof English history to find that the Lancastrians lay for eight days\r\nquiescent, and made no endeavour to replace the King in his capital.\r\nKnowing the extraordinary apathy which the citizens displayed all\r\nover England during the Wars of the Roses, we may be sure that the\r\nLondoners, in spite of their preference for York, would not have\r\nventured to exclude the Northern army when it claimed admittance at\r\ntheir gates.\r\n\r\nBut on this one occasion Queen Margaret displayed not only her usual\r\nwant of judgment, but a want of firmness that was foreign to her\r\ncharacter. King Henry, asserting for once some influence on politics,\r\nand asserting it to his own harm, had determined to spare London and\r\nthe home counties the horrors of plunder at the hands of the Northern\r\nhordes. Not an armed force but a few envoys were sent to London,\r\nwhile the main body of the troops were held back, and the van pushed\r\nno farther than Barnet. Simultaneously the King issued strenuous\r\nproclamations against raiding of any kind. This ordinance caused vast\r\nmurmuring among the Northern Men, observes the Abbot of St. Albans, on\r\nwhom the King was quartered, but had not the least effect in curbing\r\ntheir propensity to plunder.\r\n\r\nThe Londoners had quite made up their minds to submit; their only\r\nthought was to buy their pardon as cheaply as possible at the\r\nKing's hands. On the 20th they sent the Duchesses of Bedford and\r\nBuckingham--the widows of the great Regent of France and of the\r\nLancastrian Duke slain at Northampton--together with certain aldermen,\r\nto plead for grace and peace at the hands of the Queen. The King and\r\nQueen were found at Barnet, whither they had moved from St. Albans, and\r\ngave not unpropitious answers, although that very morning Margaret had\r\ndoomed to execution the unfortunate Bonville and Kyrriel. As a proof\r\nof their good intentions they undertook to move back their army out of\r\nreach of the city; accordingly on Thursday the 25th the Northerners, in\r\na state of deep disgust, were sent back to Dunstable.\r\n\r\nThe first demand which the Queen had made on London was for a supply of\r\nprovisions for her army; and on Friday the 26th the Mayor and aldermen\r\ngathered a long train of waggons, laden with \"all sorts of victuals,\r\nand much Lenten stuff,\" and prepared to despatch it northward. The\r\ncity, however, was in a great state of disturbance. Public feeling was\r\nexcited by the plundering of the Lancastrians, and news had arrived\r\nthat the cause of York was not lost, and that a Yorkist army was\r\nmarching to the relief of London. To the horror of the more prudent\r\ncitizens, a mob, headed by Sir John Wenlock's cook, stopped the carts\r\nat Newgate, plundered the provisions, and drove the waggoners away.\r\n\r\nSuch an act was bound to draw down punishment, and that same afternoon\r\na great body of Lancastrian men-at-arms, under Sir Baldwin Fulford,\r\nwas pushed up to Westminster to overawe the city. The Londoners had to\r\nmake up their minds that Friday evening whether they would fight or\r\nsubmit, and many were the heart-searchings of the timid aldermen; but\r\non Saturday morning their grief was turned into joy. News arrived that\r\nWarwick and the Earl of March were at hand: Fulford's men abandoned\r\nWestminster and fell back northward; and ere the day was out the\r\ntravel-stained troops of the Yorkist lords were defiling into the city.\r\nBy nightfall ten thousand men were within the gates, and all thought of\r\nsurrender was gone.\r\n\r\nThus King Henry's good intentions and Queen Margaret's unexpected\r\nirresolution had lost London to the Lancastrians. But their army still\r\nlay in a threatening attitude at Dunstable, and it seemed inevitable\r\nthat the Earl of March would have either to fight a battle or to stand\r\na siege before he was a week older.\r\n\r\nBut before the fate of England was put to the arbitrament of combat\r\nthere was one thing to be done. The cruel deaths of York and Salisbury\r\nhad driven the quarrel between York and Lancaster beyond the\r\npossibility of accommodation. In spite of all the personal respect\r\nthat was felt for King Henry, it was no longer possible that the heir\r\nof Duke Richard should be content to pose merely as the destined\r\nsuccessor to the throne. Now that Henry was again in the hands of his\r\nwife and the Beauforts, it was certain that the royal name would be\r\nused to the utmost against the Yorkists. They must have some cry to set\r\nagainst the appeal to national loyalty which would be made in the name\r\nof King Henry.\r\n\r\nNo doubt Warwick and Edward had settled the whole matter on their ride\r\nfrom Chipping Norton to London, for their action showed every sign of\r\nhaving been long planned out. On the Sunday morning, within twenty-four\r\nhours of their arrival in the city, their army was drawn out \"in the\r\ngreat field outside Clerkenwell,\" and while a great multitude of\r\nLondoners stood by, George Bishop of Exeter, the orator of the Neville\r\nclan, made a solemn statement of Edward's claim to the throne. At once\r\nsoldiers and citizens joined in the shout, \"God save King Edward!\" and\r\nthere was no doubt of the spontaneity of their enthusiasm. The heart of\r\nthe people was with York, and it only remained necessary to legalise\r\ntheir choice by some form of election.\r\n\r\nSave the three Nevilles, Warwick, Fauconbridge, and Bishop George,\r\nthere seems to have been no peer with Edward at the moment. Warwick\r\nfelt that it would not look well that his cousin should ostensibly\r\nreceive his crown from the Nevilles alone, whatever might be the\r\nreality of the case. Accordingly the few Yorkist peers within reach\r\nwere hastily summoned. The Archbishop of Canterbury came in from Kent,\r\nwhere he had been \"waiting for better times.\" The Duke of Norfolk,\r\nLord Fitzwalter, Lord Ferrers of Chartley, and the Bishop of Salisbury\r\nappeared ere two days were out. Then these eight peers, spiritual and\r\ntemporal, with a dozen or so of knights, and a deputation of London\r\ncitizens, solemnly met at Baynard's Castle and declared Edward King.\r\nThere had not been an instance of the election of a monarch by such a\r\nscanty body of supporters since the meeting of the Witan that chose\r\nHenry the First. The house of Neville and their cousin of Norfolk were\r\npractically the sole movers in the business.\r\n\r\nNext day, Thursday March 4th, Edward rode in state to Westminster\r\nwith his scanty following of notables. There before the high altar he\r\ndeclared his title, and sat on his throne, with the sceptre of Edward\r\nthe Confessor in his hand, beneath a canopy, receiving the homage and\r\nfealty of his adherents. Then embarking in a state barge he returned by\r\nwater to the Tower where he fixed his abode, deserting the York family\r\nmansion of Baynard's Castle. Meanwhile the heralds proclaimed him at\r\nevery street corner as Edward the Fourth, King of France and England,\r\nand Lord of Ireland.\r\n\r\nEvery one had been expecting that the coronation would be interrupted\r\nby the news that Queen Margaret's army was thundering at the gates; but\r\nno signs of the approach of an enemy appeared, and that same day it\r\nwas known that the Queen had broken up from Dunstable and marched away\r\nnorthward. Her troops were in a state of incipient disbandment: they\r\nhad refused to obey the King's proclamation against plunder, and had\r\nmelted away by thousands, some to harry the Home Counties, some to bear\r\noff booty already obtained. The men that still adhered to the standards\r\nwere so few and so discontented that the Lancastrian lords begged the\r\nQueen to retreat. They had heard exaggerated rumours of the strength\r\nof King Edward, and dared not fight him. Accordingly Henry, his wife\r\nand son, and his nobles, with their whole following, rode off along the\r\nWatling Street, sending before them messengers to raise the whole force\r\nof the North, and to bid it meet their retiring army on the borders of\r\nYorkshire.\r\n\r\nThe festivities of the coronation had not prevented the Yorkist lords\r\nfrom keeping the imminence of their danger close before their eyes.\r\nThe ceremony had taken place on Thursday afternoon; by early dawn\r\non Friday Mowbray had ridden off eastward to array his followers in\r\nNorfolk and Suffolk. On the Saturday Warwick himself marched out by\r\nthe great North road, with the war-tried troops who had fought under\r\nhim at St. Albans and accompanied his retreat to Chipping Norton. He\r\nmoved on cautiously, gathering in the Yorkist knights of the Midlands\r\nand his own Warwickshire and Worcestershire retainers, till he had been\r\njoined by the whole force of his party. For four or five days after\r\nWarwick had set forth, the levies of the Southern Counties continued to\r\npour into London. On the 10th the main body of infantry marched on to\r\nunite with the Earl; they were some fifteen thousand strong, Marchmen\r\nfrom the Welsh Border and Kentishmen; for Kent, ever loyal to York, had\r\nturned out its archers in full force, under a notable captain named\r\nRobert Horne. Finally, King Edward--who had remained behind till the\r\nlast available moment, cheering the Londoners, bidding for the support\r\nof doubtful adherents, getting together money, and signing the manifold\r\ndocuments which had to be drawn up on his accession--started with his\r\npersonal following, amid the cheers of the citizens and cries for\r\nvengeance on King Henry and his wife.\r\n\r\nWarwick had pushed forward cautiously, keeping in his front some light\r\nhorse under John Ratcliff, who claimed the barony of Fitzwalter. King\r\nEdward, on the other hand, came on at full speed, and was able to\r\nover-take his vanguard at Leicester. Mowbray, with the troops from the\r\nEastern Counties, was less ready; he was several days behind the King,\r\nand, as we shall see, did not come up till the actual eve of battle.\r\n\r\nThere had been some expectation that the Lancastrians would fight on\r\nthe line of the Trent, for the Northern lords tarried some days at\r\nNottingham. But as Warwick pushed on he had always found the enemy\r\nretreating before him. Their route could be traced by the blazing\r\nvillages on each side of their path, for the Northern men had gone\r\nhomewards excited to bitter wrath by the loss of the plunder of London.\r\nThey had eaten up the whole country-side, swept off the horses, pulled\r\nthe very houses to pieces in search of hidden goods, stripped every\r\nman, woman, and child they met of purse and raiment, even to the\r\nbeggars who came out to ask them for charity, and slain every man that\r\nraised a hand against them. Beyond the Trent, they said, they were in\r\nan enemy's country. In the eyes of every Southern man the measure of\r\ntheir iniquities was full.\r\n\r\nWhen Warwick and King Edward learnt that the Queen and the Northern\r\nlords had drawn their plundering bands north of the Trent, they had\r\nnot much difficulty in settling the direction of their march. It was\r\npractically certain that the Lancastrians would be found on one of\r\nthe positions across the Great North Road which cover the approach to\r\nYork. Now, as in every age since the Romans built their great line of\r\ncommunication between north and south, it would be on the line between\r\nYork and Lincoln that the fate of Northern England would be decided.\r\nThe only doubt was whether the Lancastrians would choose to defend the\r\nDon or the Aire or the Wharfe, behind each of which they might take up\r\ntheir position.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday, March 26th, the Yorkists crossed the Don unmolested, but\r\nthe news was not long in reaching them that the enemy lay behind the\r\nnext obstacle, the Aire, now swollen to a formidable torrent by the\r\nspring rains, and likely to cause much trouble ere it could be crossed.\r\nKing Henry with his wife and son lay at York, but all his lords with\r\ntheir retainers lay in the villages about Tadcaster and Cawood midway\r\nbetween the Wharfe and Aire, with their central camp hard by the church\r\nof Towton, which was destined to give its name to the coming battle.\r\n\r\nTo secure the passage of the Aire was now the task that was incumbent\r\non the Yorkists. Accordingly their vanguard under Lord Fitzwalter was\r\nsent forward in haste on to Ferrybridge, where the Roman road crosses\r\nthe stream. Contrary to expectation the place was found unoccupied, and\r\nits all-important bridge secured. The line of the Aire was won; but the\r\nFriday was not destined to pass without bloodshed. The Northern lords,\r\ncursing the carelessness which had lost them their line of defence,\r\ndetermined to fall on the advanced guard of the enemy, and beat it out\r\nof Ferrybridge before the main body should come up. Lord Clifford, who\r\ncommanded the nearest detachment, rode off at once from Towton, and\r\ncharged into Ferrybridge while the newly-arrived Yorkists were at their\r\nmeal. Fitzwalter had kept as careless a watch as his enemies; he was\r\ntaken unprepared, his men were routed, and he himself slain as he tried\r\nto rally them. At nightfall Clifford held the town, and slept there\r\nundisturbed.\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, the situation was changed. Somerset, or rather\r\nthe council of the Lancastrian lords, had taken no measures to support\r\nClifford. He was left alone at Ferrybridge with the few thousand\r\nmen of his original force, while the main army was slowly gathering\r\non Towton hill-side eight miles to the rear. Meanwhile the Yorkist\r\nmain body was approaching Ferrybridge from the south, and a detached\r\ncolumn under Lord Fauconbridge, stoutest of Warwick's many uncles, was\r\ntrying the dangerous passage at Castleford, three miles away, where\r\nthere was no one to resist them. Hearing that Fauconbridge was already\r\nacross, and was moving round to cut him off from his base, Clifford\r\nevacuated Ferrybridge and fell back towards his main body. He had\r\nalready accomplished six of the eight miles of his journey, when near\r\nDintingdale Fauconbridge suddenly came in upon his flank with a very\r\nsuperior force. Clifford had so nearly reached his friends that he was\r\nmarching in perfect security. The Yorkists scattered his men before\r\nthey could form up to fight, and killed him ere he had even time to\r\nbrace on his helmet. The survivors of his detachment were chased in\r\nupon the Lancastrian main army, which was so badly served by its scouts\r\nthat it had neither heard of Fauconbridge's approach nor taken any\r\nmeasures to bring in Clifford's party in safety. Nay, so inert were the\r\nLancastrian commanders, that they did not, after the skirmish, march\r\nout to beat off Fauconbridge, whose friends were still miles away,\r\npainfully threading the bridge of Ferrybridge or the ford at Castleford.\r\n\r\nAll through Saturday the Yorkists were slowly coming up to reinforce\r\ntheir vanguard, but the roads and the weather were so bad that the rear\r\nwas still on the other side of the Aire when night fell. However, the\r\nmain body was safely concentrated on a ridge south of Saxton village,\r\nand probably thirty-five thousand out of Edward's forty-eight thousand\r\nmen were in line, though much famished for victuals. The belated\r\nrear-guard, which was destined to form the right wing of the army on\r\nthe morrow, was composed of the troops from the Eastern Counties under\r\nMowbray; with him were Sir John Wenlock and Sir John Dynham, two of\r\nWarwick's most trusted friends. They were not expected to come up till\r\nsome hours after daybreak on Sunday morning. With the Yorkist main body\r\nwere the King, Warwick, his brother John, his uncle Fauconbridge, Lord\r\nScrope, Lord Berners, Lord Stanley, Sir William Hastings, Sir John\r\nStafford, Sir Walter Blunt, Robert Horne, the leader of the Kentishmen,\r\nand many other South-Country knights and squires.\r\n\r\nTwo miles north of the Yorkist camp at Saxton, the Lancastrians lay\r\nin full force on Towton hill-side. They had with them the largest\r\narmy that was ever put into the field during the whole war. Somerset,\r\nExeter, James Butler the Irish Earl who had endeavoured to rival\r\nWarwick's power in Wiltshire, Courtney Earl of Devon, Moleyns,\r\nHungerford, and Willoughby had brought in the South-Country adherents\r\nof Lancaster, those at least of them whom the fields of St. Albans\r\nand Northampton had left unharmed and unabashed. Sir Andrew Trollope\r\nwas there, with the remnant of the trained troops from Calais who had\r\ndeserted York at Ludford in the previous year. But the bulk of the\r\nsixty thousand men who served under the Red Rose were the retainers of\r\nthe Northern lords. Henry Percy of Northumberland appeared in person\r\nwith all his following. The Durham vassals of the elder house of\r\nNeville were arrayed under John Lord Neville, the younger brother of\r\nRalph of Westmoreland, though the Earl himself was (now as always) not\r\nforthcoming in person. Beside the Neville and Percy retainers were the\r\nbands of Lords Dacre, Welles, Roos, Beaumont, Mauley, and of the dead\r\nClifford--of all the barons and knights indeed of the North Country\r\nsave of the younger house of Neville.\r\n\r\nThe Lancastrian position was very strong. Eight miles north of\r\nFerrybridge the Great North Road is flanked by a long plateau some\r\nhundred and fifty feet above the level of the surrounding country, the\r\nfirst rising ground to the west that breaks the plain of York. The high\r\nroad to Tadcaster creeps along its eastern foot, and then winds round\r\nits northern extremity; its western side is skirted by a brook called\r\nthe Cock, which was then in flood and only passable at a few points\r\nbeside the bridge where the high road crosses it. The Lancastrians were\r\ndrawn up across the plateau, their left wing on the high road, their\r\nright touching the steep bank of the Cock. One flank was completely\r\ncovered by the flooded stream, while the other, the one which lay\r\nover the road, could only be turned by the enemy if he went down into\r\nthe plain and exposed himself to a flank attack while executing his\r\nmovement. The ground, however, was very cramped for an army of sixty\r\nthousand men; it was less than a mile and a half in breadth, and it\r\nseems likely that the Lancastrians must, contrary to the usual English\r\ncustom, have formed several lines, one in rear of the other, in order\r\nto crowd their men on to such a narrow space.\r\n\r\nThe Yorkists at Saxton lay just on the southern declivity of the\r\nplateau, within two miles of the Lancastrian line of battle, whose\r\ngeneral disposition must have been rendered sufficiently evident by the\r\ncountless watchfires along the rising ground.\r\n\r\nAlthough they knew themselves to be outnumbered by the enemy, Warwick\r\nand King Edward were determined to attack. Each of them had a father\r\nto revenge, and they were not disposed to count heads. Before it was\r\ndawn, at four o'clock on the morning of that eventful Palm Sunday, the\r\nYorkist army was drawn out. The King rode down the line bidding them\r\nremember that they had the just cause, and the men began to climb the\r\ngentle ascent of the Towton plateau. The left wing, which was slightly\r\nin advance of the main body, was led by Fauconbridge; the great central\r\nmass by Warwick in person; the King was in command of the reserve.\r\nOf the details of the marshalling we know no more, but the Yorkist\r\nline, though only thirty-five thousand strong, was drawn up on a front\r\nequal to that which the sixty thousand Lancastrians occupied, and must\r\ntherefore have been much thinner. When Norfolk and the missing right\r\nwing should appear, it was obvious that they would outflank the enemy\r\non the side of the plain. Warwick's plan, therefore, was evidently to\r\nengage the Lancastrians so closely and so occupy their attention that\r\nNorfolk should be able to take them in flank without molestation on his\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nIn the dusk of the March morning, with a strong north wind blowing in\r\ntheir faces, the clumps of Yorkist billmen and archers commenced to\r\nmount the hill. No opposition was made to their approach, but when they\r\nhad advanced for one thousand yards along the summit of the plateau,\r\nthey dimly descried the Lancastrian host in order of battle, on the\r\nfarther side of a slight dip in the ground called Towtondale. At the\r\nsame moment the wind veered round, and a heavy fall of snow commenced\r\nto beat in the faces of the Lancastrians. So thick was it that the two\r\narmies could only make out each other's position from the simultaneous\r\nshout of defiance which ran down each line. Fauconbridge, whose wing\r\nlay nearest to the enemy, determined to utilise the accident of the\r\nsnow in a manner which throws the greatest credit on his presence\r\nof mind. He sent forward his archers to the edge of the dip in the\r\nplateau, with orders to discharge a few flights of arrows into the\r\nLancastrian columns, and then to retire back again to the line of\r\nbattle. This they did; the wind bore their arrows into the crowded\r\nmasses, who with the snow beating into their eyes could not see the\r\nenemy that was molesting them, and considerable execution was done.\r\nAccordingly the whole Lancastrian line of archers commenced to reply;\r\nbut as they were shooting against the wind, and as Fauconbridge's\r\nmen had withdrawn after delivering their volley, it resulted that\r\nthe Northeners continued to pour a heavy flight of arrows into the\r\nunoccupied ground forty yards in front of the Yorkist position. Their\r\nfire was so fast and furious that ere very long their shafts began\r\nto run short. When this became noticeable, Fauconbridge led his men\r\nforward again to the edge of Towtondale, and recommenced his deadly\r\nvolleys into the enemy's right wing. The Lancastrians could make little\r\nor no reply, their store of missiles being almost used up; their\r\nposition was growing unbearable, and with a simultaneous impulse the\r\nwhole mass facing Fauconbridge plunged down into Towtondale, to cross\r\nthe dip and fall on the enemy at close quarters. The movement spread\r\ndown the line from west to east, and in a few minutes the two armies\r\nwere engaged along their whole front. Thus the Lancastrians, though\r\nfighting on their own chosen ground, had to become the assailants, and\r\nwere forced to incur the disadvantage of having the slope against them,\r\nas they struggled up the southern side of the declivity of Towtondale.\r\n\r\nOf all the battles of the Wars of the Roses, perhaps indeed of all the\r\nbattles in English history, the fight of Towton was the most desperate\r\nand the most bloody. For sheer hard fighting there is nothing that\r\ncan compare to it; from five in the morning to mid-day the battle\r\nnever slackened for a moment. No one ever again complained that the\r\nSouthern men were less tough than the Northern. Time after time the\r\nLancastrians rolled up the southern slope of Towtondale and flung\r\nthemselves on the Yorkist host; sometimes they were driven down at\r\nonce, sometimes they pushed the enemy back for a space, but they could\r\nnever break the King's line. Each time that an attacking column was\r\nrepelled, newly-rallied troops took its place, and the push of pike\r\nnever ceased. We catch one glimpse of Warwick in the midst of the\r\ntumult. Waurin tells how \"the greatest press of the battle lay on the\r\nquarter where the Earl of Warwick stood,\" and Whethamsted describes him\r\n\"pressing on like a second Hector, and encouraging his young soldiers;\"\r\nbut there is little to be gathered about the details of the fight.[5]\r\nThere cannot have been much to learn, for each combatant, lost in the\r\nmist and drifting snow, could tell only of what was going on in his\r\nown immediate neighbourhood. They have only left us vague pictures of\r\nhorror, \"the dead hindered the living from coming to close quarters,\r\nthey lay so thick,\" \"there was more red than white visible on the\r\nsnow,\" are the significant remarks of the chronicler. King Henry, as he\r\nheard his Palm-Sunday mass in York Minster ten miles away--\"he was kept\r\noff the field because he was better at praying than at fighting,\" says\r\nthe Yorkist chronicler--may well have redoubled his prayers, for never\r\nwas there to be such a slaughter of Englishmen.\r\n\r\nAt length the object for which Warwick's stubborn billmen had so long\r\nmaintained their ground against such odds was attained. The column\r\nunder the Duke of Norfolk, which was to form the Yorkist right wing,\r\nbegan to come up from Ferrybridge. Its route brought it out on the\r\nextreme left flank of the Lancastrians, where the high road skirts the\r\nplateau. Too heavily engaged in front to suspect that all the army of\r\nYork was not yet before them, Somerset and his colleagues had made no\r\nprovision against a new force appearing beyond their left wing. Thus\r\nNorfolk's advancing columns were able to turn the exposed flank, open\r\nan enfilading fire upon the enemy's left rear, and, what was still\r\nmore important, to cut him off from all lines of retreat save that\r\nwhich led across the flooded Cock. The effect of Norfolk's advance was\r\nat once manifest; the battle began to roll northward and westward,\r\nas the Lancastrians gave back and tried to form a new front against\r\nthe unsuspected enemy. But the moment that they began to retire the\r\nwhole Yorkist line followed them. The arrival of Norfolk had been\r\nto Warwick's men what the arrival of Blücher was to Wellington's\r\nat Waterloo; after having fought all the day on the defensive they\r\nhad their opportunity at last, and were eager to use it. When the\r\nLancastrians had once begun to retire they found themselves so hotly\r\npushed on that they could never form a new line of battle. Their gross\r\nnumbers were crushed more and more closely together as the pressure\r\non their left flank became more and more marked, and if any reserves\r\nyet remained in hand, there was no way of bringing them to the front.\r\nYet, as all the chroniclers acknowledge, the Northern men gave way to\r\nno panic; they turned again and again, and strove to dispute every\r\nstep between Towtondale and the edge of the plateau. It took three\r\nhours more of fighting to roll them off the rising ground; but when\r\nonce they were driven down their position became terrible. The Cock\r\nwhen in flood is in many places unfordable; sometimes it spreads out\r\nso as to cover the fields for fifty yards on each side of its wonted\r\nbed; and the only safe retreat across it was by the single bridge on\r\nthe Tadcaster road. The sole result of the desperate fighting of the\r\nLancastrians was that this deadly obstacle now lay in their immediate\r\nrear. The whole mass was compelled to pass the river as best it could.\r\nSome escaped by the bridge; many forded the Cock where its stream ran\r\nshallow; many yielded themselves as prisoners--some to get quarter,\r\nothers not, for the Yorkists were wild with the rage of ten hours'\r\nslaughter. But many thousands had a worse fortune; striving to ford the\r\nriver where it was out of their depth, or trodden down in the shallower\r\nparts by their own flying comrades, they died without being touched by\r\nthe Yorkist steel. Any knight or man-at-arms who lost his footing in\r\nthe water was doomed, for the cumbrous armour of the later fifteenth\r\ncentury made it quite impossible to rise again. Even the billman and\r\narcher in his salet and jack would find it hard to regain his feet.\r\nHence we may well believe the chroniclers when they tell us that the\r\nCock slew its thousands that day, and that the last Lancastrians who\r\ncrossed its waters crossed them on a bridge composed of the bodies of\r\ntheir comrades.\r\n\r\nEven this ghastly scene was not to be the end of the slaughter; the\r\nYorkists urged the pursuit for miles from the field, nearly to the\r\ngates of York, still slaying as they went. The hapless King Henry,\r\nwith his wife and son, were borne out of the town by their flying\r\nfollowers, who warned them that the enemy was still close behind, and\r\nwere fain to take the road for Durham and the Border. Only Richard\r\nTunstal, the King's Chamberlain, and five horsemen more guarded them\r\nduring the flight.\r\n\r\nWhen Warwick and King Edward drew in their men from the pursuit, and\r\nbade the heralds count the slain, they must have felt that their\r\nfathers were well avenged. Nearly thirty thousand corpses lay on the\r\ntrampled snow of the plateau, or blocked the muddy course of the Cock,\r\nor strewed the road to Tadcaster and York; and of these only eight\r\nthousand were Yorkists. The sword had fallen heavily on the Lancastrian\r\nleaders. The Earl of Northumberland was carried off by his followers\r\nmortally wounded, and died next day. Of the barons, Dacre, Neville,\r\nMauley, and Welles, lay on the field. Thomas Courtney the Earl of\r\nDevon was taken alive--a worse fate than that of his fellows, for\r\nthe headsman's axe awaited him. Of leaders below the baronial rank\r\nthere were slain Sir Andrew Trollope, the late Lieutenant of Calais,\r\nSir Ralph Grey, Sir Henry Beckingham, and many more whom it would be\r\ntedious to name. The slaughter had been as deadly to the Northern\r\nknighthood as was Flodden a generation later to the noble houses of\r\nScotland; there was hardly a family that had not to mourn the loss of\r\nits head or heir.\r\n\r\nThe uphill fight which the Yorkists had to wage during the earlier\r\nhours of the day had left its mark in their ranks; eight thousand had\r\nfallen, one man for every six in the field. But the leaders had come\r\noff fortunately; only Sir John Stafford and Robert Horne, the Kentish\r\ncaptain, had fallen. So long indeed as the fight ran level, the knights\r\nin their armour of proof were comparatively safe; it was always the\r\npursuit which proved so fatal to the chiefs of a broken army.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: There is nothing authentic to be discovered of the story\r\nmentioned by Monstrelet, and popularised in Warwickshire tradition,\r\nthat the Earl slew his charger at Towton to show his men that he would\r\nnot fly.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TRIUMPH OF KING EDWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening of that bloody Palm Sunday, King Edward, Warwick, and\r\nthe other Yorkist chiefs, slept in the villages round the battlefield.\r\nNext morning, however, they set their weary army on the march to reap\r\nthe fruits of victory. In the afternoon they appeared before the gates\r\nof York, where the heads of York and Salisbury, bleached with three\r\nmonths of winter rains, still looked southward from the battlements.\r\nThe citizens had, as was usual in the time, not the slightest intention\r\nof offering resistance, but they must have felt many a qualm as\r\nEdward's men, drunk with slaughter and set on revenging the harrying of\r\nthe South by the Queen's army, drew up before their walls.\r\n\r\nEdward, however, had already fixed on the policy from which he never\r\nswerved throughout his reign--hard measure for the great and easy\r\nmeasure for the small. The Mayor and citizens were allowed to \"find\r\nmeans of grace through Lord Berners and Sir John Neville, brother to\r\nthe Earl of Warwick\"--doubtless through a sufficient gift of rose\r\nnobles. These two lords led the Mayor and Council before the King, who\r\npromptly granted them grace, and was then received into the town \"with\r\ngreat solemnity and processions.\" There Edward kept his Easter week,\r\nand made every arrangement for the subjugation of the North. His first\r\nact was to take down the heads of his father and his uncle from over\r\nthe gate, and provide for their reverent burial. His next was to mete\r\nout to his Lancastrian prisoners the measure that York and Salisbury\r\nhad received. The chief of them, Courtney Earl of Devon and the Bastard\r\nof Exeter, were decapitated in the market-place, and their heads sent\r\nsouth to be set up on London Bridge. James Earl of Wiltshire--long\r\nSalisbury's rival in the South--was caught a few days later, and\r\nsuffered the same fate.\r\n\r\nThe submission of the various Yorkshire towns was not long in coming\r\nin, and it was soon ascertained that no further resistance was to be\r\nlooked for south of the Tees. The broken bands of the Lancastrians had\r\ndisappeared from Yorkshire, and Warwick's tenants from Middleham and\r\nSherif Hoton were now able to come in to explain to their lord how they\r\nhad fared during the Lancastrian ascendency at the hands of his cousins\r\nof Westmoreland. In common with the few other Yorkists of the North,\r\nthey had received hard measure; they had been well plundered, and\r\nprobably constrained to pay up all that the Westmorelands could wring\r\nout of them, as arrears for the twenty years during which the Yorkshire\r\nlands of Neville had been out of the hands of the senior branch.\r\n\r\nA few days after Easter, Warwick and Edward moved out of York and\r\npushed on to Durham. On the way they were entertained at Middleham\r\nwith such cheer as the place could afford after its plunder by the\r\nLancastrians. Nowhere did they meet with any resistance, and the task\r\nof finishing the war appeared so simple that the King betook himself\r\nhomeward about May 1st, leaving Warwick with a general commission to\r\npacify the North. John Neville remained behind with his brother, as\r\ndid Sir Robert Ogle and Sir John Coniers, the only two Yorkists of\r\nimportance in the North outside the Neville family. The King took\r\nwith him the rest of the lords, who were wanted for the approaching\r\nfestivals and councils in London, and with them the bulk of the army.\r\n\r\nThe task which Warwick had received turned out to be a much more\r\nformidable matter than had been expected. King Henry, Queen Margaret,\r\nthe Dukes of Somerset and Exeter, Lords Hungerford and Roos, with the\r\nother surviving Lancastrian leaders, had fled to Scotland, where they\r\nhad succeeded in inducing the Scotch regents--Kennedy, Boyd, and their\r\nfellows--to continue the policy of the late King, and throw themselves\r\nheartily into the war with the Yorkists. The inducement offered was the\r\ncession of Berwick and Carlisle, and the former town was at once handed\r\nover \"and well stuffed with Scots.\" Nor was it only on Scotch aid that\r\nthe Lancastrians relied; they had determined to make application to the\r\nKing of France, and Somerset and Hungerford sailed for the Continent\r\nat the earliest opportunity. They were stayed at Dieppe by orders of\r\nthe wily Louis the Eleventh, who was averse to committing himself to\r\neither party in the English struggle while his own crown was hardly\r\nthree months old; but their mission was not to be without its results.\r\nPutting aside the hope of assistance from France and Scotland, the\r\nLancastrians had still some resources of their own on which they might\r\ncount. A few scattered bands of Percy retainers still kept the field in\r\nNorthumberland, and the Percy crescent still floated over the strong\r\ncastles of Alnwick, Bamborough, and Dunstanburgh.\r\n\r\nThe problem which fell into Warwick's hands was to clear the routed\r\nLancastrians out of Northumberland, and at the same time to keep good\r\nwatch against the inroads of the Scotch and the English refugees who\r\nwere leagued with them. Defensive and offensive operations would have\r\nto be combined, for, on the one hand, the siege of the Percy castles\r\nmust be formed--and sieges in the fifteenth century were slow and weary\r\nwork--while, on the other, the raids of the lords of the Scotch Border\r\nmight occur at any time and place, and had to be met without delay.\r\nWarwick was forced to divide his troops, undertaking himself to cover\r\nthe line of the Tyne and observe the Northumbrian castles, while his\r\nbrother John, who for his services at Towton had just been created Lord\r\nMontagu, took charge of the force which was to fend off Scotch attacks\r\non the Western Marches.\r\n\r\nIn June the Scots and the English refugees crossed the Border in force;\r\ntheir main body made a push to seize Carlisle, which the Lancastrian\r\nchiefs, the Duke of Exeter and Lord Grey de Rougemont, promised to\r\ndeliver to them as they had already delivered Berwick. The town,\r\nhowever, shut its gates; and the invaders were constrained to content\r\nthemselves with burning its suburbs and forming a regular siege. But as\r\nthey lay before it they were suddenly attacked by Montagu, who came up\r\nlong before he was expected, and beat them back over the Border with\r\nthe loss of several thousand men; among the slain was John Clifford,\r\nbrother to the peer who had fallen at Towton.\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously another raiding party, led by Lord Roos and\r\nSir John Fortescu, the late Chief-Justice, and guided by two of the\r\nWestmoreland Nevilles, Thomas and Humphrey, slipped down from the\r\nMiddle Marches and attempted to raise the county of Durham. But as they\r\ndrew near to the ancestral Neville seat of Brancepeth, they were fallen\r\nupon by forces brought up by Warwick, and were driven back on June\r\n26th as disastrously as the main army for which they had been making a\r\ndiversion.\r\n\r\nThese two defeats cooled the ardour of the Scotch allies of the house\r\nof Lancaster. Moreover, trouble was soon provided for them on their\r\nown side of the Border. There were always discontented nobles to be\r\nfound in the North, and King Edward was able to retaliate on the Scotch\r\nregents by concluding a treaty with the Earl of Ross, which set a\r\nconsiderable rebellion on foot in the Highlands and the Western Isles.\r\nBy the time that the autumn came there was no longer any immediate\r\ndanger to be apprehended on the Borders, and Warwick was able to\r\nrelinquish his northern viceroyalty and come south, to pay his estates\r\na flying visit, and to obey the writ which summoned him in November to\r\nKing Edward's first Parliament at Westminster.\r\n\r\nWhile Warwick had been labouring in the North, the King had been\r\nholding his Court at London, free to rule after his own devices. At\r\ntwenty Edward the Fourth had already a formed character, and displayed\r\nall the personal traits which developed in his later years. The spirit\r\nof the fifteenth century was strong in him. Cultured and cruel, as\r\nskilled as the oldest statesman in the art of cajoling the people,\r\nas cool in the hour of danger as the oldest soldier, he was not a\r\nsovereign with whom even the greatest of his subjects could deal\r\nlightly. Yet he was so inordinately fond of display and luxury of all\r\nsorts, so given to sudden fits of idleness, so prone to sacrifice\r\npolicy to any whim or selfish impulse of the moment, that he must have\r\nseemed at times almost contemptible to a man who, like Warwick, had\r\nnone of the softer vices of self-indulgence. Still in mourning for a\r\nfather and brother not six months dead, with a kingdom not yet fully\r\nsubdued to his fealty, with an empty exchequer, with half the nobles\r\nand gentry of England owing him a blood-feud for their kinsmen slain\r\nat Towton, Edward had cast aside every thought of the past and the\r\nmorrow, and was bearing himself with all the thriftless good-humour of\r\nan heir lately come to a well-established fortune. It seems that the\r\nsplendours of his coronation-feasts were the main things that had been\r\noccupying his mind while Warwick had been fighting his battles in the\r\nNorth. Reading of his jousts and banquets and processions, his gorgeous\r\nreception by the city magnates, and his lavish distributions of honours\r\nand titles, we hardly remember that he was no firmly-rooted King, but\r\nthe precarious sovereign of a party, surrounded by armed enemies and\r\nsecret conspirators.\r\n\r\nIn the lists of honours which Edward had distributed after his return\r\nhomeward from Towton field, Warwick found that he had not been\r\nneglected. The offices which he had held in 1458-59 had been restored\r\nto him; he was again Captain of the town and castle of Calais,\r\nLieutenant of the March of Picardy, Grand Chamberlain of England, and\r\nHigh Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster. In addition he was now created\r\nConstable of Dover and Warden of the Cinque Ports, and made Master of\r\nthe Mews and Falcons, and Steward of the Manor and Forest of Feckenham.\r\nHis position in the North, too, was made regular by his appointment\r\nas Warden and Commissary General of the East and West Marches, and\r\nProcurator Envoy and Deputy for all negotiations with the Scots.\r\n\r\nNor had the rest of the Neville clan been overlooked. John Neville had,\r\nas we have already mentioned, received the barony of Montagu. George\r\nNeville the Bishop of Exeter was again Chancellor. Fauconbridge, who\r\nhad fought so manfully at Towton, was created Earl of Kent. Moreover,\r\nSir John Wenlock, Warwick's most faithful adherent, who had done him\r\nsuch good service at Sandwich in 1459, was made a baron. We shall\r\nalways find him true to the cause of his patron down to his death at\r\nTewkesbury field. Although several other creations swelled the depleted\r\nranks of the peerage at the same time, the Nevilles could not complain\r\nthat they had failed to receive their due share of the rewards.\r\n\r\nNor would it seem that at first the King made any effort to resent\r\nthe natural ascendency which his cousin exercised over his counsels.\r\nThe experienced warrior of thirty-three must still have overborne\r\nthe precocious lad of twenty when their wills came into contact. The\r\ncampaigns of 1459-60, in which he had learnt soldiering under Warwick,\r\nmust have long remained impressed on Edward's mind, even after he had\r\nwon his own laurels at Mortimer's Cross and shared with equal honours\r\nin the bloody triumph of Towton. So long as Richard Neville was still\r\nin close and constant contact with the young King, his ascendency was\r\nlikely to continue. It was when, in the succeeding years, his duties\r\ntook him for long periods far from Edward's side, that the Earl was to\r\nfind his cousin first growing indifferent, then setting his own will\r\nagainst his adviser's, then deliberately going to work to override\r\nevery scheme that came to him from any member of the Neville house.\r\n\r\nWe have no particular notice of Warwick's personal doings in the\r\nParliament which sat in November and December 1461; but the language of\r\nhis brother George the Chancellor represents, no doubt, the attitude\r\nwhich the whole family adopted. His text was \"Amend your ways and\r\nyour doings,\" and the tenor of his discourse was to point out that\r\nthe ills of England during the last generation came from the national\r\napostasy in having deserted the rightful heirs so long in behalf of\r\nthe usurping house of Lancaster. Now that a new reign had commenced, a\r\nreform in national morality should accompany the return of the English\r\nto their lawful allegiance. The sweeping acts of attainder against\r\nfourteen peers and many scores of knights and squires which the Yorkist\r\nParliament passed might not seem a very propitious beginning for the\r\nnew era, but at any rate it should be remembered to the credit of\r\nthe Nevilles that the King's Council under their guidance tempered\r\nthe zeal of the Commons by many limitations which guarded the rights\r\nof numerous individuals who would have been injured by the original\r\nproposals.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the Government allowed the opportunity of reconciliation to\r\nmany of the more luke-warm adherents of Lancaster, who had not been\r\npersonally engaged in the last struggle. It is to Warwick's credit\r\nthat his cousin Ralph of Westmoreland was admitted to pardon, and not\r\ntaken to task for the doings of his retainers, under the conduct of\r\nhis brother, in the campaign of Wakefield and St. Albans. Ralph was\r\nsummoned to the Parliament, and treated no worse than if he had been a\r\nconsistent adherent of York. The same favour was granted to the Earl\r\nof Oxford, till he forfeited it by deliberate conspiracy against the\r\nKing. Sanguine men were already beginning to hope that King Edward and\r\nhis advisers might be induced to end the civil wars by a general grant\r\nof amnesty, and might invite his rival Henry to return to England as\r\nthe first subject of the Crown. Such mercy and reconciliation, however,\r\nwere beyond the mind of the ordinary partisan of York; and the popular\r\nfeeling of the day was probably on the side of the correspondent of the\r\nPastons, who complained \"that the King receives such men as have been\r\nhis great enemies, and great oppressors of his Commons, while such as\r\nhave assisted his Highness be not rewarded; which is to be considered,\r\nor else it will hurt, as seemeth me but reason.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE PACIFICATION OF THE NORTH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever the partisans of peace may have hoped in the winter of\r\n1461-62, there was in reality no prospect of a general pacification so\r\nlong as the indomitable Margaret of Anjou was still at liberty and free\r\nto plot against the quiet of England. The defeats of her Scotch allies\r\nin the summer of 1461 had only spurred her to fresh exertions. In the\r\nwinter, while Edward's Parliament was sitting at Westminster, she was\r\nbusy hatching a new scheme for simultaneous risings in various parts\r\nof England, accompanied by descents from France and Brittany aided by\r\na Castilian fleet. Somerset and Hungerford had got some countenance\r\nfrom the King of France, and Margaret's own hopeful heart built on\r\nthis small foundation a great scheme for the invasion of England. A\r\nScotch raid, a rising in Wales, a descent of Bretons upon Guernsey and\r\nJersey, and a great French landing at Sandwich, were to synchronise:\r\n\"if weather and wind had served them, they should have had one hundred\r\nand twenty thousand men on foot in England upon Candlemass Day.\" But\r\nweather and wind were unpropitious, and the only tangible result of the\r\nplan was to cost the life of the Earl of Oxford, who had been told\r\noff to head the insurgents of the Eastern Counties. He had been taken\r\ninto favour by King Edward, and we need have small pity for him when he\r\nwas detected in correspondence with the Queen at the very time that he\r\nwas experiencing the clemency of her rival. But it was an evil sign of\r\nthe times that he and his son were executed, not after a regular trial\r\nbefore their peers, but by a special and unconstitutional court held by\r\nthe Earl of Worcester as Constable of England. For this evil precedent\r\nWarwick must take the blame no less than Edward.\r\n\r\nBut Margaret of Anjou had not yet exhausted her energy. So soon as the\r\nstorms of winter were over and Somerset returned from France without\r\nthe promised succours, she resolved to set out in person to stimulate\r\nthe zeal of Louis the Eleventh, and to gather help from her various\r\nrelatives on the Continent. Escaping from Scotland by the Irish Sea,\r\nshe rounded the Land's End and came ashore with her young son in\r\nBrittany. The Duke gave her twelve thousand crowns, and passed her\r\non to her father Réné in Anjou. From his Court she went on to King\r\nLouis, who lay at Rouen. With him she had more success than might have\r\nbeen expected, though far less of course than she had hoped. Louis\r\nwas able to show that he had already got together a fleet, reinforced\r\nby some Breton and Castilian vessels, in the mouth of the Seine. In\r\nreturn for an agreement by which Margaret promised the cession of\r\nCalais, and perhaps that of the Channel Isles, he undertook to engage\r\nfrankly in the war, and to put at Margaret's disposition a force\r\nfor the invasion of England. The way in which Louis chose a leader\r\nfor this army was very characteristic of the man. He had in close\r\nconfinement at the time a favourite of his father and an enemy of his\r\nown, Peter de Brézé, Count of Maulévrier and Seneschal of Normandy.\r\nDe Brézé was a gallant knight and a skilled leader; only a few years\r\nbefore he had distinguished himself in the English war, and among other\r\nachievements had taken and sacked Sandwich. The King now offered him\r\nthe choice of staying in prison or of taking charge of an expedition to\r\nScotland in aid of Margaret. De Brézé accepted with alacrity the latter\r\nalternative, as much, we are told, from chivalrous desire to assist\r\na distressed Queen as from dislike for the inside of the dungeons of\r\nLoches. Quite satisfied, apparently, at getting an enemy out of the\r\ncountry on a dangerous quest, Louis gave him twenty thousand livres in\r\nmoney, forty small vessels, and about two thousand men, and bade him\r\ntake the Queen whither she would go.\r\n\r\nWhile Louis and Margaret were negotiating, their English enemies had\r\nbeen acting with their accustomed vigour. When May came round Warwick\r\nagain resumed command of the Northern Border, and marched out to finish\r\nthe work that had been begun in the previous year. He was already on\r\nScottish ground, and had taken at least one castle north of the Border,\r\nwhen he received a herald from the Scotch regents offering to treat\r\nfor peace. By his commission, drawn up in the last year, Warwick was\r\nauthorised to act as plenipotentiary in any such matter. Accordingly\r\nhe sent back his army and went himself to Dumfries, where he met Mary,\r\nthe Dowager Queen of Scotland, and the majority of the regents. They\r\nconcluded an armistice to last till St. Bartholomew's Day, and then\r\nset to work to discuss terms of peace. The common report ran that the\r\nScots were ready not only to give up the Lancastrian cause, but even to\r\ndeliver over the person of King Henry. Moreover, there was talk of an\r\nalliance by marriage between the English King and a Scotch Princess.\r\nThis new departure, mainly brought about by the Queen-Dowager's\r\ninfluence,[6] was not without its effect on the Lancastrian partisans,\r\nwho found themselves left unsupported to resist Warwick's army, which\r\nwas, during the negotiations, put under the command of his brother\r\nMontagu and set to reduce the Northumbrian fortresses. King Henry\r\nfled from the Scotch Court and took refuge in one of the castles of\r\nthe Archbishop of St. Andrews, the chief member of the regency who\r\nopposed peace with England. Lord Dacre, brother of the peer who fell at\r\nTowton, surrendered himself to Montagu, and was sent to London, where\r\nKing Edward received him into grace. Even Somerset himself, the chief\r\nof the party, lost heart, and began to send secret letters to Warwick\r\nto ascertain whether there was any hope of pardon for him. Meanwhile\r\nNaworth Castle was surrendered to Montagu, and the more important\r\nstronghold of Alnwick yielded itself to Lord Hastings, who had been\r\ndetached to form its siege. Bamborough was given up by Sir William\r\nTunstal, and of all the Northern fortresses only Dunstanburgh remained\r\nin Lancastrian hands, and it seemed that this place must fall ere the\r\nyear was out.\r\n\r\nBelieving that the war was practically at an end, Warwick now turned\r\nsouth, and rode up to London to lay the Scotch proposal before the\r\nKing. But he had not long left the Border when the whole aspect of\r\naffairs was once more transformed by the reappearance of Queen Margaret\r\non the scene.\r\n\r\nWhile Montagu and Warwick had been in the North, King Edward had been\r\nsorely vexed by rumours of French invasion. Seventy French and Spanish\r\nships were roaming the Channel, and Fauconbridge, who had set out to\r\nfind them with a hastily-raised fleet, came home without success. A\r\nFrench force had mustered in Picardy, and Queen Margaret lay all the\r\nsummer at Boulogne, tampering with the garrison of Calais, who had\r\nfallen into mutiny on account of long arrears of pay. But Calais failed\r\nto revolt, Louis made no serious attempt on England, and the Queen\r\nat last grew impatient and determined to start herself for England,\r\nthough she could only rely on the assistance of Peter de Brézé and his\r\ntwo thousand men. Setting sail early in October, she passed up the\r\neastern coast, and landed in Northumberland, expecting that all the\r\nNorth Country would rise to her aid. No general insurrection followed,\r\nbut Margaret's arrival was not without effect. Both Alnwick and\r\nBamborough fell into her hands--the former by famine, for it was wholly\r\nunvictualled and could not hold out a week; the latter betrayed by the\r\ngovernor's brother. Nor was this all; the presence of the Queen moved\r\nthe Scotch regents to break off their negotiations with England, and\r\ndenounce the truce which they had so recently concluded. All that the\r\nstatesmanship of Warwick and the sword of Montagu had done for England\r\nin the year 1462 was lost in the space of a week.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the unwelcome news of Margaret's advent reached London,\r\nWarwick flew to repair the disaster. Only eight days after the fall\r\nof Bamborough he was already at the head of twenty thousand men, and\r\nhastening north by forced marches. The King, ill-informed as to the\r\nexact force that had landed in Northumberland, had sent out in haste\r\nfor every man that could be gathered, and followed himself with the\r\nfull levy of the Southern Counties.\r\n\r\nThe nearer the Yorkists approached to the scene of action the less\r\nformidable did their task appear. The approach of winter had prevented\r\nthe Scots from putting an army into the field, and the Lancastrians\r\nand their French allies had made no attempt to push out from their\r\ncastles. All that they had done was to strengthen the three strongholds\r\nand fill them with provisions. In Alnwick lay Peter de Brézé's son and\r\nsome of the Frenchmen, together with Lord Hungerford. Somerset, who\r\nhad dropped his secret negotiations with Warwick when his mistress\r\nreturned from France, held Bamborough; with him were Lord Roos and\r\nJasper Earl of Pembroke. Sir Ralph Percy, the fighting-man of the Percy\r\nclan--for his nephew the heir of Northumberland was a minor--had made\r\nhimself strong in Dunstanburgh. Meanwhile the Queen, on the approach\r\nof Warwick, had quitted her adherents and set sail for Scotland with\r\nher son and her treasure, under convoy of de Brézé and the main body of\r\nthe French mercenaries. But the month was now November, the seas were\r\nrough, and off Bamborough she was caught in a storm; her vessel, with\r\nthree others, was driven against the iron-bound coast, and she herself\r\nbarely escaped with her life in a fishing-boat which took her into\r\nBerwick. Her treasures went to the bottom; and of her French followers\r\nfour hundred were cast ashore on Holy Island, where they were forced to\r\nsurrender next day to a force sent against them by Montagu.\r\n\r\nWarwick had now arrived at Newcastle, and King Edward was but a few\r\ndays' march behind him. Though the month was November, and winter\r\ncampaigns, especially in the bleak and thinly-populated North, were in\r\nthe fifteenth century as unusual as they were miserable, Warwick had\r\ndetermined to make an end of the new Lancastrian invasion before the\r\nScots should have time to move. Luckily we have a full account of his\r\ndispositions for the simultaneous siege of the three Percy castles,\r\nfrom the pen of one who served on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe army was arranged as follows. King Edward with the reserve lay at\r\nDurham, in full touch with York and the South. The Duke of Norfolk\r\nheld Newcastle, having as his main charge the duty of forwarding\r\nconvoys of victuals and ammunition to the front, and of furnishing\r\nthem with strong escorts on their way, to guard against any attempts\r\nmade by roving bands of Scots or Percy retainers to break the line\r\nof communications, thirty miles long, which connected Newcastle with\r\nthe army in the field. The force under Warwick's immediate command,\r\ncharged with the reduction of the fortresses, was divided into four\r\nfractions. The castles lie at considerable intervals from each other:\r\nfirst, Bamborough to the north on a bold headland projecting into the\r\nsea, a Norman keep surrounded with later outworks; next Dunstanburgh,\r\nnine miles farther south, and also on the coast; lastly, Alnwick,\r\nfive miles south-west of Dunstanburgh, on a hill, three miles from the\r\nsea-coast, overlooking the river Alne. Dunstanburgh and Bamborough,\r\nif not relieved from the sea, could be surrounded and blockaded with\r\ncomparative ease; Alnwick, the largest and strongest of the three\r\ncastles, required to be shut in on all sides, and was likely to prove\r\nby far the hardest task. Luckily for Warwick the Roman road known as\r\nthe Devil's Causeway was available for the connection of his outlying\r\nforces, as it runs almost by the walls of Alnwick and within easy\r\ndistance of both Dunstanburgh and Bamborough. To each castle its own\r\nblockading force was attached. Opposite Bamborough, the one of the\r\nthree which was nearest to Scotland and most exposed to attack by a\r\nrelieving army, lay Montagu and Sir Robert Ogle, both of whom knew\r\nevery inch of the Border. Dunstanburgh was beleaguered by Tiptoft Earl\r\nof Worcester and Sir Ralph Grey. Alnwick was observed by Fauconbridge\r\nand Lord Scales. Warwick himself, with the general reserve, lay at\r\nWarkworth, three miles from Alnwick, ready to transfer himself to any\r\npoint where his aid might be needed.\r\n\r\nThe forces employed were not less than thirty thousand men, without\r\ncounting the troops on the lines of communication at Newcastle\r\nand Durham. To feed such a body in the depth of winter, in a\r\nsparsely-peopled and hostile country and with only one road open, was\r\nno mean task. Nevertheless the arrangements of Warwick worked with\r\nperfect smoothness and accuracy,--good witness to the fact that his\r\ntalent for organisation was as great as his talent for the use of\r\ntroops in the field. Every morning, we are told, the Earl rode out\r\nand visited all the three sieges \"for to oversee; and if they wanted\r\nvictuals or any other thing he was ready to purvey it to them with\r\nall his power.\" His day's ride was not less than thirty miles in all.\r\nThe army was in good spirits and sure of success. \"We have people\r\nenow here,\" wrote John Paston, whose duty it was to escort Norfolk's\r\nconvoys to and fro, \"so make as merry as ye can at home, for there is\r\nno jeopardie toward.\"\r\n\r\nA siege at Christmastide was the last thing that the Lancastrians had\r\nexpected at the moment of their rising; they had counted on having the\r\nwhole winter to strengthen their position. No hope of immediate aid\r\nfrom Scotland was forthcoming, and after three weeks' blockade the\r\nspirits of the defenders of Bamborough and Dunstanburgh sank so low\r\nthat they commenced to think of surrender. Somerset, as we have already\r\nmentioned, had been in treaty with Warwick six months before, with the\r\nobject of obtaining grace from King Edward. He now renewed his offer to\r\nWarwick, pledging himself to surrender Bamborough in return for a free\r\npardon. Ralph Percy, the commander of Dunstanburgh, professed himself\r\nready to make similar terms.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat surprising to find that Warwick supported, and Edward\r\ngranted, the petitions of Somerset and Percy. But it was now two years\r\nsince the tragedy of Wakefield, both the King and his cousin were\r\nsincerely anxious to bring about a pacification, and they had resolved\r\nto forget their blood feud with the Beauforts. On Christmas Eve 1462,\r\ntherefore, Bamborough and Dunstanburgh threw open their gates, such\r\nof their garrisons as chose to swear allegiance to King Edward being\r\nadmitted to pardon, while the rest, headed by Jasper of Pembroke and\r\nLord Roos, were allowed to retire to Scotland unarmed and with white\r\nstaves in their hands. Somerset and Percy went on to Durham, where they\r\nswore allegiance to the King. Edward took them into favour and \"gave\r\nthem his own livery and great rewards,\" to Somerset in especial a grant\r\nof twenty marks a week for his personal expenses, and the promise of a\r\npension of a thousand marks a year. As a token of his loyalty Somerset\r\noffered to take the field under Warwick against the Scots, and he was\r\naccordingly sent up to assist at the siege of Alnwick. Percy was shown\r\nequal favour; as a mark of confidence the King made him Governor of\r\nBamborough which Somerset had just surrendered.\r\n\r\nAfter the yielding of his chief adversary, King Edward thought that\r\nthere was no further need for his presence in the North. Accordingly\r\nhe returned home with the bulk of the army, leaving Warwick with ten\r\nthousand men, commanded by Norfolk and the Earl of Worcester, to finish\r\nthe siege of Alnwick. Somerset lay with them, neither overmuch trusted\r\nnor overmuch contemned by his late enemies. Warwick's last siege,\r\nhowever, was not destined to come to such an uneventful close as those\r\nof Bamborough and Dunstanburgh. Lord Hungerford and the younger de\r\nBrézé made no signs of surrender, and protracted their defence till\r\nJanuary 6th 1463.\r\n\r\nOn that day, at five o'clock in the dusk of the winter morning, a\r\nrelieving army suddenly appeared in front of Warwick's entrenchments.\r\nThough it was mid-winter, Queen Margaret had succeeded in stirring up\r\nthe Earl of Angus--the most powerful noble in Scotland and at that\r\nmoment practical head of the Douglases--to lead a raid into England.\r\nFired by the promise of an English dukedom, to be given when King Henry\r\nshould come to his own again, Angus got together twenty thousand men,\r\nand slipping through the Central Marches, and taking to the Watling\r\nStreet, presented himself most unexpectedly before the English camp.\r\nWith him was Peter de Brézé, anxious to save his beleaguered son, and\r\nthe Queen's French mercenaries.\r\n\r\nFor once in his life Warwick was taken by surprise. The Scots showed in\r\nsuch force that he thought himself unable to maintain the whole of his\r\nlines, and concentrated his forces on a front facing north-west between\r\nthe castle hill and the river. Here he awaited attack, but nothing\r\nfollowed save insignificant skirmishing; Angus had come not to fight,\r\nbut only to save the garrison. When the English blockading force was\r\nwithdrawn, a party of Scotch horse rode up to the postern-gate of the\r\ncastle and invited the besieged to escape; accordingly Lord Hungerford,\r\nthe younger de Brézé, Sir Richard Tunstal, and the great majority of\r\nthe garrison, hastily issued forth and joined the relieving force. Then\r\nAngus, to the surprise of the English, drew off his men, and fell back\r\nhastily over the Border.\r\n\r\nWarwick had been quite out-generalled; but the whole of his fault\r\nseems to have been the neglect to keep a sufficient force of scouts on\r\nthe Border. If he had known of Angus's approach, he would have been\r\nable to take proper measures for protecting the siege. But the main\r\nfeeling in the English army was rather relief at the departure of the\r\nScots than disgust at the escape of the garrison. \"If on that day the\r\nScots had but been bold as they were cunning, they might have destroyed\r\nthe English lords, for they had double their numbers,\" writes the\r\nchronicler. The thing which attracted most notice was the fact that\r\nthe renegade Somerset showed no signs of treachery, and bore himself\r\nbravely in the skirmish, \"proving manfully that he was a true liegeman\r\nto King Edward.\" Henceforth he was trusted by his colleagues.\r\n\r\nSome of the Alnwick garrison had been either unwilling or unable to\r\nescape with Angus. These protracted the defence for three weeks longer,\r\nbut on January 30th they offered to surrender, and were allowed to\r\ndepart unharmed to Scotland. The castle was garrisoned for the King,\r\nand entrusted to Sir John Ashley, to the great displeasure of Sir Ralph\r\nGrey to whom it had been promised. We shall see ere long what evils\r\ncame from this displeasure.\r\n\r\nIt seemed now as if the war could not be far from its end. No single\r\nplace now held out for Lancaster save the castle of Harlech in North\r\nWales, where an obscure rebellion had been smouldering ever since 1461.\r\nWe must not therefore blame Warwick for want of energy, when we find\r\nthat in March he left the indefatigable Montagu in command, and came up\r\nto London to attend the Parliament which King Edward had summoned to\r\nmeet in April. Nevertheless, as we shall see, his absence had the most\r\nunhappy results on the Border.\r\n\r\nWe have no definite information as to Warwick's doings in the spring\r\nof 1463, but we cannot doubt that it was by his counsel and consent\r\nthat in April his brother the Chancellor and his friend Lord Wenlock,\r\nin company with Bourchier Earl of Essex, went over-sea to Flanders,\r\nand contracted with Philip Duke of Burgundy a treaty of commercial\r\nintercourse and a political alliance. Philip then conveyed the English\r\nambassadors to the Court of Louis of France, who was lying at Hesdin,\r\nand with him they negotiated a truce to last from October 1st till the\r\nnew year. This was to be preliminary to a definite peace with France,\r\na plan always forward in Warwick's thoughts, for he was convinced that\r\nthe last hope of Lancaster lay in the support of Louis, and that peace\r\nbetween Edward and the French King would finally ruin Queen Margaret's\r\nplans.\r\n\r\nBut while George Neville and the Burgundians were negotiating, a new\r\nand curious development of this period of lingering troubles had\r\ncommenced. Once more the Lancastrians were up in arms, and again the\r\nevil began in Northumberland. Sir Ralph Grey had been promised, as we\r\nmentioned above, the governorship of Alnwick, and had failed to receive\r\nit when the castle fell. This so rankled in his mind that he determined\r\nto risk his fortunes on an attempt to seize the place by force and\r\ndeliver it up again to the Queen. In the end of May he mastered the\r\ncastle by treachery, and sent for the Lancastrians from over the\r\nBorder. Lord Hungerford came up, and once more received command of the\r\ncastle which he had evacuated five months before. The news of this\r\nexploit of Grey's was too much for the loyalty of Sir Ralph Percy, the\r\nrenegade governor of Bamborough. When de Brézé and Hungerford came\r\nbefore his gates he deliberately surrendered the castle to them without\r\nresistance.\r\n\r\nThe exasperating news that the North was once more aflame reached\r\nWarwick as he banqueted with King Edward at Westminster on May 31st.\r\nWith his customary energy the Earl set himself to repair the mischief\r\nbefore it should spread farther. On June 2nd he was once more marching\r\nup the Great North Road, with a new commission to act as the King's\r\nlieutenant in the North, while his brother Montagu was named under him\r\nLord Warden of the Marches. Warwick's plan of campaign this time was\r\nnot to reduce the castles at once, but to cut off the Lancastrians\r\nfrom their base by forcing the Scots to conclude peace. Accordingly he\r\nleft the strongholds on his right and made straight for the Border.\r\nHis first exploit was to relieve Norham Castle, on the English side of\r\nthe Tweed, which was beset by four thousand Scotch borderers, aided\r\nby Peter de Brézé and his mercenaries. Queen Margaret herself was in\r\ntheir camp, and had dragged her unfortunate consort down to the seat\r\nof war. When the English appeared, the Scots and French raised the\r\nsiege and retired behind the Tweed, where they set themselves to guard\r\nthe ford called the Holybank. But Warwick was determined to cross; he\r\nwon the passage by force of arms, and drove off its defenders. A few\r\nmiles across the Border he found de Brézé's Frenchmen resting in an\r\nabbey, and fell on them with such vehemence that several hundreds were\r\ntaken prisoners, including the Lord of Graville and Raoul d'Araines, de\r\nBrézé's chief lieutenants.\r\n\r\nOne chronicler records a curious incident at this fight. \"At the\r\ndeparting of Sir Piers de Bressy and his fellowship, there was one\r\nmanly man among them, that purposed to meet with the Earl of Warwick;\r\nhe was a taberette (drummer) and he stood upon a little hill with his\r\ntabor and his pipe, tabering and piping as merrily as any man might.\r\nThere he stood by himself; till my lord Earl came unto him he would not\r\nleave his ground.\" Warwick was much pleased with the Frenchman's pluck,\r\nbade him be taken gently and well treated, \"and there he became my\r\nlord's man, and yet is with him, a full good servant to his lord.\"\r\n\r\nThe moment that Warwick was actually across the Tweed, the Scotch\r\nregents offered him terms of peace. To prove their sincerity they\r\nagreed to send off Queen Margaret. Such pressure was accordingly\r\nput upon her that \"she with all her Council, and Sir Peter with the\r\nFrenchmen, fled away by water in four balyngarys, and they landed\r\nat Sluis in Flanders, leaving all their horses and harness behind\r\nthem, so sorely were they hasted by the Earl and his brother the Lord\r\nMontagu.\"[7] With the horses and harness was left poor King Henry, who\r\nfor the next two years wandered about in an aimless way on both sides\r\nof the Border, a mere meaningless shadow now that he was separated from\r\nhis vehement consort.\r\n\r\nNow at last the Civil War seemed at an end. With Margaret over-sea,\r\nSomerset a liegeman of York, the Northumbrian castles cut off from any\r\nhope of succour, and the Scots suing humbly for peace, Warwick might\r\nhope that his three years' toil had at last come to an end. That, after\r\nall, the struggle was to be protracted for twelve months more, was a\r\nfact that not even the best of prophets could have predicted.\r\n\r\nAfter the raid which drove Queen Margaret away, and turned the hearts\r\nof the Scots toward peace, we lose sight of Warwick for some months.\r\nWe only know that, for reasons to us unknown, he did not finish his\r\nexploits by the capture of the Northumbrian castles, but came home in\r\nthe autumn, leaving them still unsubdued. Perhaps after the winter\r\ncampaign of 1462-63 he wished to spend Christmas for once in his own\r\nfair castle of Warwick. His estates indeed in Wales and the West\r\nMidlands can hardly have seen him since the Civil War recommenced in\r\n1459, and must have required the master's eye in every quarter. His\r\nwife and his daughters too, now girls growing towards a marriageable\r\nage as ages were reckoned in the fifteenth century, must long have been\r\nwithout a sight of him.\r\n\r\nWhile Warwick was for once at home, and King Edward was making a\r\nprogress round his kingdom with much pomp and expense, it would seem\r\nthat Queen Margaret, from the retreat in Lorraine to which she had\r\nbetaken herself, was once more exerting her influence to trouble\r\nEngland. At any rate a new Lancastrian conspiracy was hatched in the\r\nwinter of 1463-64, with branches extending from Wales to Yorkshire.\r\nThe outbreak commenced at Christmas by the wholly unexpected rebellion\r\nof the Duke of Somerset. Henry of Beaufort had been so well treated by\r\nKing Edward that his conduct appears most extraordinary. He had supped\r\nat the King's board, slept in the King's chamber, served as captain of\r\nthe King's guard, and jousted with the King's favour on his helm; yet\r\nat mid-winter he broke away for the North, with a very small following,\r\nand made for the garrison at Alnwick. Probably Somerset's conscience\r\nand his enemies had united to make his position unbearable. The\r\nYorkists were always taunting him behind his back, and when he appeared\r\nin public in the King's company a noisy mob rose up to stone him, and\r\nEdward had much ado to save his life. But whether urged by remorse for\r\nhis desertion of Lancaster, or by resentment for his treatment by the\r\nYorkists, Somerset set himself to join the sinking cause at one of its\r\ndarkest hours.\r\n\r\nHis arrival in the North, where he came almost alone, for his followers\r\nwere wellnigh all cut off at Durham, was the signal for the new\r\nLancastrian outbreak. Simultaneously Jasper of Pembroke endeavoured to\r\nstir up Wales. A rising took place in South Lancashire and Cheshire,\r\nin which at one moment ten thousand men are said to have been in the\r\nfield: a band set out from Alnwick, pushed by the Yorkist garrison\r\nat Newcastle, and seized the Castle of Skipton in Craven, hard by\r\nWarwick's ancestral estates in the North Riding; and Norham on the\r\nBorder was taken by treachery.\r\n\r\nIn March Warwick set out once more to regain the twice-subdued North.\r\nThe rising in Cheshire collapsed without needing his arms to put it\r\ndown, and he was able to reach York without molestation. From thence\r\nhe sent to Scotland to summon the regency to carry out the terms of\r\npacification which they had promised in the previous year. The Scots\r\nmade no objection, and offered to send their ambassadors to York if\r\nsafe escort was given them past the Lancastrian fortresses. Accordingly\r\nMontagu started from Durham to pick up his troops at Newcastle, where\r\nLord Scrope was already arrayed with the levies of the Northern\r\nCounties. This journey was near being Montagu's last, for a few miles\r\noutside Newcastle he was beset by his cousin Sir Humphrey Neville,\r\nthe Earl of Westmoreland's nephew, who fell on his escort with eighty\r\nspears as he passed through a wood. Montagu, however, escaped by a\r\ndetour and came safely into Newcastle, where he took charge of Scrope's\r\nforce and marched for the Scotch Border.\r\n\r\nAt Hedgeley Moor he found Somerset with all the Lancastrian refugees\r\nbarring the way. There had mustered all the survivors of the campaigns\r\nof 1461-2-3, Roos and Hungerford, and Tailboys Lord of Kyme, and the\r\ntwo traitors Ralph Grey and Ralph Percy. On April 15th their five\r\nthousand men fell on Montagu, whose forces were probably about equal.\r\nThe shock was sharp but short; and when Ralph Percy, who led their\r\nvan, was struck down, the Lancastrians dispersed. Percy, if the tale\r\nbe true, refused to fly with the rest, and died crying, \"I have saved\r\nthe bird in my bosom,\" meaning his loyalty to Henry. He should have\r\nremembered his faith a year before, when he swore fealty to Edward at\r\nDurham.\r\n\r\nMontagu was now able to reach Scotland unmolested. He brought the Scots\r\nCommissioners back to York, and a fifteen years' peace was safely\r\nconcluded, the Scots promising to give no further shelter to the\r\nLancastrians, and the English to disavow the Earls of Ross and Douglas\r\nwhom they had armed against the Scotch regency. \"An the Scots be true,\r\nthe treaty may continue fifteen years,\" said the chronicler, \"but it is\r\nhard to trust Scots: they be ever full of guile and deceit.\"\r\n\r\nSomerset and his followers were now without hope. Their refuge in\r\nScotland was cut off and their Northumbrian strongholds doomed to a\r\nspeedy fall, for King Edward had been casting all the winter a train of\r\ngreat ordnance such as England had never seen before, and the pieces\r\nwere already on their way north. Nevertheless the desperate adherents\r\nof Lancaster hardened their hearts, gathered their broken bands, and\r\nmade one last desperate stand for the mastery of the North. On the\r\nLinhills, by the town of Hexham, they arrayed themselves against\r\nMontagu on May 13th. But when the Yorkists came in sight the hearts of\r\nthe followers of Somerset failed them. All save five hundred melted\r\naway from their banners, and the small band that stayed to fight was\r\nbroken, beaten, surrounded, and captured by Montagu's four thousand men\r\nwith perfect ease.\r\n\r\nThe Lancastrian lords had fought their last field; one and all were\r\nslain or captured on the hill a mile outside Hexham town, where they\r\nhad made their stand. Montagu marked his triumph by the most bloody\r\nexecutions that had been seen throughout the whole war. At Hexham, next\r\nday, he beheaded Somerset, Sir Edmond Fitzhugh, a moss-trooping captain\r\ncalled Black Jack, and three more. On the next day but one he slew at\r\nNewcastle Lord Roos, Lord Hungerford, and three others. Next day he\r\nmoved south to his brother's ancestral seat of Middleham, and executed\r\nSir Philip Wentworth and six squires. Finally, he conducted to York and\r\nbeheaded there Sir Thomas Hussey and thirteen more, the remainder of\r\nthe prisoners of rank who had come into his hands.\r\n\r\nFor these sweeping executions Warwick must take part of the blame.\r\nBut there is this to be said in defence of Montagu's stern justice,\r\nthat Somerset and three or four others of the victims were men who had\r\nclaimed and abused Edward's pardon, and that Roos and several more had\r\nbeen spared at the surrender of Bamborough in 1462. The whole body\r\nhad shown that they could never be trusted, even if they professed to\r\nsubmit to York; and the practical justification of their death lies\r\nin the fact that with their execution ceased all attempts to raise\r\nthe North in favour of the house of Lancaster. Public opinion among\r\nthe Yorkists had nothing but praise for Montagu. \"Lo, so manly a man\r\nis this good Lord Montagu,\" wrote a London chronicler, \"he spared not\r\ntheir malice, nor their falseness, nor their guile, nor their treason,\r\nbut slew many, and took many, and let smite off their heads\"!\r\n\r\nEven before the battle of Hedgeley Moor King Edward had set out to\r\nreinforce Warwick and Montagu. The news of their victories reached\r\nhim on the way, but he continued to advance, bringing with him the\r\ngreat train of artillery destined for the siege of the Northumbrian\r\nfortresses. This journey was important to King Edward in more ways\r\nthan one. How he spent one day of it, May 1st, when he lay at Stony\r\nStratford, we shall presently see. If Warwick had but known of his\r\nmaster's doings on that morning, we may doubt if he would have been so\r\njoyous over his brother's victories or so remorseless with his captured\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\nThe King came up to York in the end of May, \"and kept his estate there\r\nsolemnly in the palace, and there he created John Lord Montagu Earl\r\nof Northumberland,\" in memory of his good service during the last few\r\nmonths, handing over to him, together with the Percy title, the greater\r\npart of the great Percy estates--Alnwick and Warkworth and Langley and\r\nPrudhoe, and many more fiefs between Tyne and Tweed.\r\n\r\nWarwick now advanced northward to complete the work which his brother\r\nhad begun in the previous month, while the King remained behind in\r\nYorkshire and occupied himself in the capture of Skipton Castle in\r\nCraven. On June 23rd the Earl appeared before Alnwick and summoned the\r\nplace. The Lancastrians had lost their leaders at Hexham, there was no\r\nmore fight in them, and they surrendered at once on promise of their\r\nlives. Dunstanburgh and Norham followed the example of Alnwick. Only\r\nBamborough held out, for there Sir Ralph Grey had taken refuge. He knew\r\nthat his treachery at Alnwick in the last year could never be pardoned,\r\nand utterly refused to surrender. With him was Sir Humphrey Neville,\r\nwho had so nearly destroyed Montagu two months before.\r\n\r\nWe happen to have an account of the siege of Bamborough which is\r\nnot without its interest. When the army appeared before the castle\r\nWarwick's herald summoned it in form--\r\n\r\n Offering free pardon, grace, body, and livelihood to all, reserving\r\n two persons, Sir Ralph Grey and Sir Humphrey Neville. Then Sir Ralph\r\n clearly determined within himself to live or die within the place,\r\n though the herald charged him with all inconvenience and shedding of\r\n blood that might befall: saying in this wise: \"My Lord ensureth you\r\n upon his honour to sustain this siege before you these seven years so\r\n that he win you: and if ye deliver not this jewel, which the King our\r\n dread Sovereign Lord hath greatly in favour, seeing it marches so nigh\r\n unto his enemies of Scotland, whole and unbroken with ordnance, and if\r\n ye suffer any great guns to be laid against it, it shall cost you a\r\n head for every gun shot, from the head of the chief man to the head of\r\n the least person within.\" But Sir Ralph departed from the herald, and\r\n put him in endeavour to make defence.\r\n\r\nWarwick was therefore compelled to have recourse to his battering\r\ntrain, the first that had been used to effect in an English siege.\r\n\r\n So all the King's guns that were charged began to shoot upon the\r\n said castle. \"Newcastle,\" the King's greatest gun, and \"London,\" the\r\n second gun of iron, so betide the place that the stones of the walls\r\n flew into the sea. \"Dijon,\" a brass gun of the King's, smote through\r\n Sir Ralph Grey's chamber oftentimes, and \"Edward\" and \"Richard,\" the\r\n bombardels, and other ordnance, were busied on the place. Presently\r\n the wall was breached, and my lord of Warwick, with his men-at-arms\r\n and archers, won the castle by assault, maugre Sir Ralph Grey, and\r\n took him alive, and brought him to the King at Doncaster. And there\r\n the Earl of Worcester, Constable of England, sat in judgment on him.\r\n\r\nTiptoft was a judge who never spared, and Grey a renegade who could\r\nexpect no mercy. The prisoner was sentenced to be beheaded, and only\r\nspared degradation from his knighthood \"because of his noble ancestor,\r\nwho suffered at Southampton for the sake of the King's grandfather,\r\nRichard Earl of Cambridge.\" His head was sent to join the ghastly\r\ncollection standing over the gate on London Bridge.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of Bamborough the first act of King Edward's reign was at\r\nan end.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Queen Mary had, so the story runs, shown overmuch favour\r\nto the Duke of Somerset. He openly boasted of his success in love, and\r\nthe Queen was ever after his deadly enemy.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: The famous story of the robber and Queen Margaret, placed\r\nby so many writers after the battle of Hexham, seems quite impossible.\r\nIf the incident took place at all, it happened on the other side of the\r\nChannel.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE QUARREL OF WARWICK AND KING EDWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Hedgeley Moor and Hexham and the final surrender of the\r\nNorthumbrian castles ended the last desperate attempt of the\r\nLancastrians to hold their own in the North. The few surviving leaders\r\nwho had escaped the fate of Somerset and Hungerford left Scotland and\r\nfled over-sea. Philip de Commines soon after met the chief of them in\r\nthe streets of Ghent \"reduced to such extremity of want and poverty\r\nthat no common beggar could have been poorer. The Duke of Exeter was\r\nseen (though he concealed his name) following the Duke of Burgundy's\r\ntrain begging his bread from door to door, till at last he had a small\r\npension allowed him in pity for his subsistence.\" With him were some of\r\nthe Somersets, John and Edmund, brothers of the Duke who had just been\r\nbeheaded. Jasper of Pembroke made his way to Wales and wandered in the\r\nhills from county to county, finding friends nowhere. No one could have\r\nguessed that the cause of Lancaster would ever raise its head again.\r\n\r\nThe times of war were at length over, and Warwick, like the rest of\r\nEnglishmen, might begin to busy himself about other things than battles\r\nand sieges. In July he was at last free, and was able to think of\r\nturning southward to seek for more than a passing visit the Midland\r\nestates of which he had seen so little for the last five years. After\r\na short interval of leisure, we find him in September sitting in the\r\nKing's Council, and urging on two measures which he held necessary for\r\nthe final pacification of the realm. The first was the conclusion of a\r\ndefinite treaty of peace with France. It was from King Louis that the\r\nLancastrians had been accustomed to draw their supplies of ships and\r\nmoney, and while England and France were still at war it was certain\r\nthat King Edward's enemies would continue to obtain shelter and succour\r\nacross the Channel. Accordingly the Earl urged on the conclusion of a\r\ntreaty, and finally procured the appointment of himself and his friend\r\nand follower Wenlock as ambassadors to Louis. The second point of his\r\nschemes was connected with the first. It was high time, as all England\r\nhad for some time been saying, that the King should marry.[8] Edward\r\nwas now in his twenty-fourth year, \"and men marvelled that he abode\r\nso long without any wife, and feared that he was not over chaste of\r\nhis living.\" Those, indeed, who were about the King's person knew that\r\nsome scandal had already been caused by his attempts, successful and\r\nunsuccessful, on the honour of several ladies about the Court. Rumour\r\nhad for some time been coupling Edward's name with that of various\r\nprincesses of a marriageable age among foreign royal families. Some\r\nhad said that he was about to marry Mary of Gueldres, the Queen Dowager\r\nof Scotland, and others had speculated on his opening negotiations for\r\nthe hand of Isabel of Castile, sister of the reigning Spanish King.\r\nBut there had been no truth in these reports. Warwick's scheme was to\r\ncement the peace with France by a marriage with a French princess, and\r\nin the preliminary inquiries which the King permitted him to send to\r\nLouis the marriage question was distinctly mentioned. Louis' sisters\r\nwere all married, and his daughters were mere children, so that their\r\nnames were not brought forward, for King Edward required a wife of\r\nsuitable years, \"to raise him goodly lineage such as his father had\r\nreared.\" The lady whom Warwick proposed to the King was Bona of Savoy,\r\nsister to Charlotte Queen of France, a princess who dwelt at her\r\nbrother-in-law King Louis' Court and in whose veins ran the blood both\r\nof the Kings of France and the Dukes of Burgundy.\r\n\r\nKing Edward made no open opposition to Warwick's plans. The project\r\nwas mooted to King Louis, safe conducts for the English Embassy were\r\nobtained, and Warwick and Wenlock were expected at St. Omer about\r\nOctober 3rd or 4th. But at the last moment, when Warwick attended at\r\nReading on September 28th to receive his master's final instructions, a\r\nmost astounding announcement was made to him. We have an account of the\r\nscene which bears some marks of truth.\r\n\r\nThe Council met for the formal purpose of approving the marriage\r\nnegotiations. A speaker, probably Warwick, laid before the King the\r\nhope and expectation of his subjects that he would deign to give them a\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\n Then the King answered that of a truth he wished to marry, but that\r\n perchance his choice might not be to the liking of all present. Then\r\n those of his Council asked to know of his intent, and would be told\r\n to what house he would go. To which the King replied in right merry\r\n guise that he would take to wife Dame Elizabeth Grey, the daughter of\r\n Lord Rivers. But they answered him that she was not his match, however\r\n good and however fair she might be, and that he must know well that\r\n she was no wife for such a high prince as himself; for she was not the\r\n daughter of a duke or earl, but her mother the Duchess of Bedford had\r\n married a simple knight, so that though she was the child of a duchess\r\n and the niece of the Count of St. Pol, still she was no wife for him.\r\n When King Edward heard these sayings of the lords of his blood and his\r\n Council, which it seemed good to them to lay before him, he answered\r\n that he should have no other wife and that such was his good pleasure.\r\n\r\nThen came the clinching blow; no other wife could he have--for he was\r\nmarried to Dame Elizabeth already!\r\n\r\nIn fact, five months before, on May 1st, when he ought to have been\r\nfar on his way to the North, King Edward had secretly ridden over from\r\nStony Stratford to Grafton in Northamptonshire, and wedded the lady.\r\nNo one had suspected the marriage, for the King had had but a short\r\nand slight acquaintance with Elizabeth Grey, who had been living a\r\nretired life ever since her husband, a Lancastrian knight, fell in\r\nthe moment of victory at the second battle of St. Albans. Edward had\r\ncasually met her, had been conquered by her fair face, and had made\r\nhot love to her. Elizabeth was clever and cautious; she would hear of\r\nnothing but a formal offer of marriage, and the young King, perfectly\r\ninfatuated by his passion, had wedded her in secret at Grafton in the\r\npresence of no one save her mother and two other witnesses. This was\r\nthe urgent private business which had kept him from appearing to open\r\nhis Parliament at York.\r\n\r\nThe marriage was a most surprising event. Lord Rivers, the lady's\r\nfather, had been a keen Lancastrian. He it was who had been captured at\r\nSandwich in 1460, and brought before Warwick and Edward to undergo that\r\ncurious scolding which we have elsewhere recorded. And now this \"made\r\nlord, who had won his fortune by his marriage,\" had become the King's\r\nfather-in-law. Dame Elizabeth herself was seven years older than her\r\nnew husband, and was the mother of children twelve and thirteen years\r\nof age. The public was so astonished at the match that it was often\r\nsaid that the Queen's mother, the old Duchess of Bedford, must have\r\ngiven King Edward a love philtre, for in no other way could the thing\r\nbe explained.\r\n\r\nWarwick and the rest of the lords of the Council were no less vexed\r\nthan astonished by this sudden announcement. The Earl had broached\r\nthe subject of the French marriage to King Louis, and was expected to\r\nappear within a few days to submit the proposal for acceptance. The\r\nKing, knowing all the time that the scheme was impossible, had allowed\r\nhim to commit himself to it, and now left him to explain to King Louis\r\nthat he had been duped in the most egregious way, and had been excluded\r\nfrom his master's confidence all along. Very naturally the Earl let the\r\nembassy drop; he could not dare to appear before the French King to ask\r\nfor peace, when the bond of union which he had promised to cement it\r\nwas no longer possible.\r\n\r\nBut vexed and angered though he must have been at the way in which\r\nhe had been treated, Warwick was too loyal a servant of the house of\r\nYork to withdraw from his master's Council. He bowed to necessity, and\r\nacquiesced in what he could not approve. Accordingly Warwick attended\r\nnext day to hear the King make public announcement of his marriage in\r\nReading Abbey on the feast of St. Michael, and he himself, in company\r\nwith George of Clarence the King's brother, led Dame Elizabeth up to\r\nthe seat prepared for her beside her husband, and bowed the knee to her\r\nas Queen.\r\n\r\nFor a few months it seemed as if the King's marriage had been a single\r\nfreak of youthful passion, and the domination of the house of Neville\r\nin the royal Councils appeared unshaken. As if to make amends for his\r\nlate treatment of Warwick, Edward raised his brother George Neville\r\nthe Chancellor to the vacant Archbishopric of York, and in token of\r\nconfidence sent the Earl as his representative to prorogue a Parliament\r\nsummoned to meet on November 4th.\r\n\r\nBut these marks of regard were not destined to continue. The favours\r\nof the King, though there was as yet no open breach between him and\r\nhis great Minister, were for the future bestowed in another quarter.\r\nThe house of Rivers was almost as prolific as the house of Neville;\r\nthe Queen had three brothers, five sisters, and two sons, and for\r\nthem the royal influence was utilised in the most extraordinary way\r\nduring the next two years. Nor was it merely inordinate affection for\r\nhis wife that led King Edward to squander his wealth and misuse his\r\npower for the benefit of her relatives. It soon became evident that\r\nhe had resolved to build up with the aid of the Queen's family one of\r\nthose great allied groups of noble houses whose strength the fifteenth\r\ncentury knew so well--a group that should make him independent of\r\nthe control of the Nevilles. A few days after the acknowledgment of\r\nthe Queen, began a series of marriages in the Rivers family, which\r\ndid not cease for two years. In October 1464, immediately after the\r\nscene at Reading, the Queen's sister Margaret was married to Thomas\r\nLord Maltravers, the heir of the wealthy Earl of Arundel. In January\r\n1465 John Woodville, the youngest of her brothers, wedded the Dowager\r\nDuchess of Norfolk. This was a disgraceful match: the bridegroom was\r\njust of age, the bride quite old enough to be his grandmother; but she\r\nwas a great heiress, and the King persuaded her to marry the sordid\r\nyoung man. Within eighteen months more, nearly the whole of the family\r\nhad been married off: Anne Woodville to the heir of Bourchier Earl of\r\nEssex; Mary Woodville to the eldest son of Lord Herbert, the King's\r\nmost intimate counsellor after Warwick in his earlier years; Eleanor\r\nWoodville to George Grey heir of the Earl of Kent; and Catherine\r\nWoodville, most fortunate of all, to the young Duke of Buckingham,\r\ngrandson of the old Duke who had fallen at Northampton. To end the tale\r\nof the alliances of this most fortunate family, it is only necessary\r\nto add that even before Queen Elizabeth's marriage her eldest brother\r\nAnthony had secured the hand of Elizabeth, heiress of the Lord Scales\r\nwho was slain on the Thames in 1460. Truly the Woodville marriages may\r\ncompare not unfavourably with those of the Nevilles!\r\n\r\nWhile the King was heaping his favours on the house of Rivers, Warwick\r\nwas still employed from time to time in the service of the Crown. But\r\nhe could no longer feel that he had the chief part in guiding his\r\nmonarch's policy. Indeed, the King seems to have even gone out of his\r\nway to carry out every scheme on a different principle from that which\r\nthe Earl adopted. In the spring of 1465, at the time of the Queen's\r\nformal coronation in May--a ceremony which he was glad enough to\r\nescape--Warwick went over-sea to conduct negotiations with the French\r\nand Burgundians. He met the Burgundian ambassadors at Boulogne, and\r\nthose of France at Calais. It was a critical time for both France\r\nand Burgundy, for the War of the Public Weal had just broken out,\r\nand each party was anxious to secure the friendship, or at least the\r\nneutrality of England. With the Burgundians, whom Warwick met first,\r\nno agreement could be made, for the Count of Charolois, who had now\r\ngot the upper hand of his aged father Duke Philip, refused to make any\r\npledges against helping the Lancastrians. He was at this very time\r\npensioning the exiled Somersets and Exeter, and almost reckoned himself\r\na Lancastrian prince, because his mother, Isabel of Portugal, was a\r\ngrand-daughter of John of Gaunt. Warwick and Charles of Charolois were\r\nquite unable to agree. Each of them was too much accustomed to have his\r\nown way, and though they held high feasts together at Boulogne, and\r\nwere long in council, they parted in wrath. There would seem to have\r\nbeen something more than a mere difference of opinion between them,\r\nfor ever afterwards they regarded each other as personal enemies. King\r\nLouis, whose ambassadors met Warwick a month later, proved far more\r\naccommodating than the hot-headed Burgundian prince. He consented to\r\nforget the matter of the marriage, and agreed to the conclusion of a\r\ntruce for eighteen months, during which he engaged to give no help to\r\nQueen Margaret, while Warwick covenanted that England should refrain\r\nfrom aiding the Dukes of Burgundy and Bretagne, now in full rebellion\r\nagainst their sovereign.\r\n\r\nLate in the summer of 1465 Warwick returned home just in time to hear\r\nof a new stroke of fortune which had befallen his master. Henry the\r\nSixth had just been captured in Lancashire. The ex-king had wandered\r\ndown from his retreat in Scotland, and was moving about in an aimless\r\nway from one Lancastrian household to another, accompanied by no one\r\nbut a couple of priests. One of Henry's entertainers betrayed him,\r\nand he was seized by John Talbot of Basshall as he sat at meat in\r\nWaddington Hall, and forwarded under guard to London. At Islington\r\nWarwick rode forth to meet his late sovereign, and by the King's\r\norders led him publicly through the city, with his feet bound by\r\nleather straps to his stirrups. Why this indignity was inflicted on\r\nthe unfortunate Henry it is hard to say; there cannot possibly have\r\nbeen any fear of a rescue, and Warwick might well have spared his late\r\nmaster the shame of bonds. Henry was led along Cheapside and Cornhill\r\nto the Tower, where he was placed in honourable custody, and permitted\r\nto receive the visits of all who wished to see him.\r\n\r\nThat Warwick was not yet altogether out of favour with King Edward was\r\nshown by the fact that he was asked to be godfather to the Queen's\r\nfirst child, the Princess Elizabeth, in the February of the following\r\nyear 1466. But immediately afterwards came the succession of events\r\nwhich marked the final breach between the King and the Nevilles. In\r\nMarch Edward suddenly dismissed from the office of Treasurer Lord\r\nMountjoy, a friend of Warwick's, and gave the post to his wife's father\r\nLord Rivers, whom he soon created an earl. The removal of his friend\r\nwas highly displeasing to Warwick; but worse was to follow. Warwick's\r\nnephew George Neville, the heir of his brother John, had been affianced\r\nto Anne heiress of the exiled Duke of Exeter; but the Queen gave the\r\nDuchess of Exeter four thousand marks to break off the match, and the\r\nyoung lady was wedded to Thomas Grey, Elizabeth's eldest son by her\r\nfirst marriage. This blow struck the Nevilles in their tenderest point;\r\neven the marriages which had made their good fortune were for the\r\nfuture to be frustrated by royal influence.\r\n\r\nThe next slight which Warwick received at the hands of his sovereign\r\ntouched him even more closely. His eldest daughter Isabel, who had been\r\nborn in 1451, was now in her sixteenth year, and already thoughts about\r\nher marriage had begun to trouble her father's brain. The Earl counted\r\nher worthy of the highest match that could be found in the realm, for\r\nthere was destined to go with her hand such an accumulation of estates\r\nas no subject had ever before possessed--half of the lands of Neville,\r\nMontacute, Despenser, and Beauchamp. The husband whom Warwick had hoped\r\nto secure for his child was George Duke of Clarence, the King's next\r\nbrother, a young man of eighteen years. Clarence was sounded, and\r\nliked the prospect well enough, for the young lady was fair as well as\r\nrich. But they had not reckoned with the King. After a long visit which\r\nClarence and his younger brother Richard of Gloucester had paid to\r\nWarwick in the end of 1466, Edward got wind of the proposed marriage.\r\n\"When the King knew that his brothers had returned from their visit\r\nto the Earl at Cambridge, he asked them why they had left his Court,\r\nand who had given them counsel to visit the Earl. Then they answered\r\nthat none had been the cause save they themselves. And the King asked\r\nwhether there had been any talk of affiancing them to their cousins,\r\nthe Earl's daughters; and the Duke of Clarence\"--always prompt at a\r\nlie--\"answered that there was not. But the King, who had been fully\r\ninformed of all, waxed wroth, and sent them from his presence.\" Edward\r\nstrictly forbade the marriage, and for the present there was no more\r\ntalk of it; but Clarence and Warwick understood each other, and were\r\nalways in communication, much to the King's displeasure. It did not\r\nplease him to find his heir presumptive and his most powerful subject\r\non too good terms.\r\n\r\nThe King waited a few months more, and then proceeded to put a far\r\nworse insult on his old friends and followers. In May 1467 he sent\r\nWarwick over-sea, with a commission to visit the King of France, and\r\nturn the eighteen months truce made in 1465 into a permanent peace on\r\nthe best terms possible. The errand seemed both useful and honourable,\r\nand Warwick went forth in good spirits; but it was devised in reality\r\nmerely to get him out of the kingdom, at a time when the King was\r\nabout to cross all his most cherished plans.\r\n\r\nLouis was quite as desirous as Warwick himself to conclude a permanent\r\npeace. It was all-important to him that England should not be on the\r\nside of Burgundy, and he was ready to make the Earl's task easy.\r\nThe reception which he prepared for Warwick was such as might have\r\nbeen given to a crowned head. He went five leagues down the Seine to\r\nreceive the English embassy, and feasted Warwick royally on the river\r\nbank. When Rouen was reached \"the King gave the Earl most honourable\r\ngreeting; for there came out to meet him the priests of every parish\r\nin the town in their copes, with crosses and banners and holy water,\r\nand so he was conducted to Notre Dame de Rouen, where he made his\r\noffering. And he was well lodged at the Jacobins in the said town of\r\nRouen. Afterward the Queen and her daughters came to the said town that\r\nhe might see them. And the King abode with Warwick for the space of\r\ntwelve days communing with him, after which the Earl departed back into\r\nEngland.\" And with him went as Ambassadors from France the Archbishop\r\nof Narbonne, the Bastard of Bourbon (Admiral of France), the Bishop of\r\nBayeux, Master Jean de Poupencourt, and William Monipenny, a Scotch\r\nagent in whom the King placed much confidence.\r\n\r\nWarwick and the French Ambassadors landed at Sandwich, where they had\r\na hearty reception; for the people of Sandwich, like all the men of\r\nKent, were great supporters of the Earl. Posts were sent forward to\r\nnotify their arrival to the King, and the party then set out to ride\r\nup to London. As they drew near the city the Earl was somewhat vexed\r\nto find that no one came forth to welcome them on the King's behalf;\r\nbut presently the Duke of Clarence came riding alone to meet him, and\r\nbrought him intelligence which turned his satisfaction at the success\r\nof the French negotiations into bitter vexation of spirit.\r\n\r\nWhen Warwick had got well over-sea, the King had proceeded to work out\r\nhis own plans, secure that he would not be interrupted. He had really\r\ndetermined to make alliance with Burgundy and not with France; and\r\nthe moment that the coast was clear a Burgundian emissary appeared in\r\nLondon. Antony \"the Grand Bastard,\" the trusted agent of the Court of\r\nCharolois, ascended the Thames at the very moment that Warwick was\r\nascending the Seine. Ostensibly he came on a chivalrous errand, to\r\njoust with the Queen's brother Lord Scales in honour of all the ladies\r\nof Burgundy. The passage of arms was duly held, to the huge delight\r\nof the populace of London, and the English chroniclers give us all\r\nits details--instead of relating the important political events of\r\nthe year. But the real object of the Bastard's visit was to negotiate\r\nan English alliance for his brother; and he was so successful that\r\nhe returned to Flanders authorised to promise the hand of the King's\r\nsister Margaret to the Count of Charolois.\r\n\r\nBut Warwick had not merely to learn that the King had stultified his\r\nnegotiations with France by making an agreement with Burgundy behind\r\nhis back. He was now informed that, only two days before his arrival,\r\nEdward had gone, without notice given or cause assigned, to his brother\r\nthe Archbishop of York, who lay ill at his house by Westminster Barrs,\r\nand suddenly dismissed him from the Chancellorship and taken the great\r\nseal from him. Open war had been declared on the house of Neville.[9]\r\n\r\nBut bitterly vexed though he was at his sovereign's double dealing,\r\nWarwick proceeded to carry out the forms of his duty. He called on the\r\nKing immediately on his arrival, announced the success of his embassy,\r\nand craved for a day of audience for the French Ambassadors. \"When the\r\nEarl spoke of all the good cheer that King Louis had made him, and\r\nhow he had sent him the keys of every castle and town that he passed\r\nthrough, he perceived from the King's countenance that he was paying no\r\nattention at all to what he was saying, so he betook himself home, sore\r\ndispleased.\"\r\n\r\nNext day the French had the audience. The King received them in state,\r\nsurrounded by Rivers, Scales, John Woodville, and Lord Hastings. \"The\r\nAmbassadors were much abashed to see him, for he showed himself a\r\nprince of a haughty bearing.\" Warwick then introduced them, and Master\r\nJean de Poupencourt, as spokesman for the rest, laid the proposals of\r\nLouis before the King. Edward briefly answered that he had pressing\r\nbusiness, and could not communicate with them himself; they might say\r\ntheir say to certain lords whom he would appoint for the purpose. Then\r\nthey were ushered out of his presence. It was clear that he would do\r\nnothing for them; indeed the whole business had only been concocted to\r\nget Warwick out of the way. It was abortive, and had been intended to\r\nbe so.\r\n\r\nThe Earl on leaving the palace was bursting with rage; his ordinary\r\ncaution and affability were gone, and he broke out in angry words even\r\nbefore the foreigners. \"As they rowed home in their barge the Frenchmen\r\nhad many discourses with each other. But Warwick was so wroth that he\r\ncould not contain himself, and he said to the Admiral of France, 'Have\r\nyou not seen what traitors there are about the King's person?' But\r\nthe Admiral answered, 'My Lord, I pray you grow not hot; for some day\r\nyou shall be well avenged.' But the Earl said, 'Know that those very\r\ntraitors were the men who have had my brother displaced from the office\r\nof Chancellor, and made the King take the seal from him.'\"\r\n\r\nEdward went to Windsor next day, taking no further heed of the\r\nAmbassadors. He appointed no one to treat with them, and they remained\r\nsix weeks without hearing from him, seeing no one but Warwick, who\r\ndid his best to entertain them, and Warwick's new ally the Duke of\r\nClarence. At last they betook themselves home, having accomplished\r\nabsolutely nothing. On the eve of their departure the King sent them a\r\nbeggarly present of hunting-horns, leather bottles, and mastiffs, in\r\nreturn for the golden hanaps and bowls and the rich jewellery which\r\nthey had brought from France.\r\n\r\nWarwick would have nothing more to do with his master. He saw the\r\nAmbassadors back as far as Sandwich, and then went off in high dudgeon\r\nto Middleham. There he held much deep discourse with his brothers,\r\nGeorge the dispossessed Chancellor, and John of Montagu the Earl of\r\nNorthumberland. At Christmas the King summoned him to Court; he sent\r\nback the reply that \"never would he come again to Council while all his\r\nmortal enemies, who were about the King's person, namely, Lord Rivers\r\nthe Treasurer, and Lord Scales and Lord Herbert and Sir John Woodville,\r\nremained there present.\" The breach between Warwick and his master was\r\nnow complete.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: There seems to be no foundation for the theory that\r\nWarwick wished the King to marry his daughter Isabel. The Earl moved\r\nstrongly in favour of the French marriage, and his daughter was too\r\nyoung, being only thirteen years of age, for a king desirous of raising\r\nup heirs to his crown.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: It seems impossible to work out to any purpose the\r\nstatement of Polidore Vergil and others that Warwick's final breach\r\nwith the King was caused by Edward's offering violence to a lady of\r\nthe house of Neville. Lord Lytton, of course, was justified in using\r\nthis hint for his romance, but the historian finds it too vague and\r\nuntrustworthy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nPLAYING WITH TREASON\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat ministers who have been accustomed to sway the destinies\r\nof kingdoms, and who suddenly find themselves disgraced at their\r\nmaster's caprice, have seldom been wont to sit down in resignation and\r\naccept their fall with equanimity. Such a line of conduct requires a\r\nself-denial and a high-flown loyalty to principle which are seldom\r\nfound in the practical statesman. If the fallen minister is well\r\nstricken in years, and the fire has gone out of him, he may confine\r\nhimself to sermons on the ingratitude of kings. If his greatness has\r\nbeen purely official, and his power entirely dependent on the authority\r\nentrusted to him by his master, his discontent may not be dangerous.\r\nBut Warwick was now in the very prime of his life,--he was just\r\nforty,--and he was moreover by far the most powerful subject within the\r\nfour seas. It was sheer madness in King Edward to goad such a man to\r\ndesperation by a series of deliberate insults.\r\n\r\nThis was no mere case of ordinary ingratitude. If ever one man had made\r\nanother, Richard Neville had made Edward Plantagenet. He had taken\r\ncharge of him, a raw lad of eighteen, at the moment of the disastrous\r\nrout of Ludford, and trained him in arms and statecraft with unceasing\r\ncare. Twice had he saved the lost cause of York, in 1459 and in 1461.\r\nHe had spent five years in harness, in one long series of battles and\r\nsieges, that his cousin might wear his crown in peace. He had compassed\r\nsea and land in embassies that Edward might be safe from foreign as\r\nwell as from domestic foes. He had seen his father and his brother fall\r\nby the axe and the sword in the cause of York. He had seen his mother\r\nand his wife fugitives on the face of the earth, his castles burnt,\r\nhis manors wasted, his tenants slain, all that the son of Richard\r\nPlantagenet might sit on the throne that was his father's due.\r\n\r\nWarwick then might well be cut to the heart at his master's\r\ningratitude. It was no marvel if, after the King's last treachery to\r\nhim in the matter of the French embassy, he retired from Court and sent\r\na bitter answer to Edward's next summons. After the open breach there\r\nwere now two courses open to him: the first to abandon all his schemes,\r\nand betake himself in silent bitterness to the management of his vast\r\nestates; the second was to endeavour to win his way back to power by\r\nthe ways which medieval England knew only too well--the way which had\r\nserved Simon de Montfort, and Thomas of Lancaster, and Richard of York;\r\nthe way that had led Simon and Thomas and Richard to their bloody\r\ngraves. The first alternative was no doubt the one that the perfect\r\nman, the ideally loyal and unselfish knight, should have chosen. But\r\nRichard Neville was no perfect man; he was a practical statesman--\"the\r\ncleverest man of his time,\" says one who had observed him closely; and\r\nhis long tenure of power had made him look upon the first place in the\r\nCouncil of the King as his right and due. His enemies the Woodvilles\r\nand Herberts had driven him from his well-earned precedence by the\r\nweapons that they could use--intrigue and misrepresentation; what more\r\nnatural than that he should repay them by the weapon that he could best\r\nemploy, the iron hand of armed force?\r\n\r\nHitherto the career of Warwick had been singularly straightforward and\r\nconsistent. Through thick and thin he had supported the cause of York\r\nand never wavered in his allegiance to it. It must not be supposed that\r\nhe changed his whole policy when his quarrel with the King came to a\r\nhead. As his conduct in 1469, when his ungrateful master was in his\r\npower, was destined to show, he had no further design than to reconquer\r\nfor himself the place in the royal Council which had been his from 1461\r\nto 1464. Later events developed his plans further than he had himself\r\nexpected, but it is evident that at first his sole design was to clear\r\naway the Woodvilles. The only element in his programme which threatened\r\nto lead to deeper and more treasonable plans was his connection\r\nwith his would-be son-in-law George of Clarence. The handsome youth\r\nwho professed such a devotion to him, followed his advice with such\r\ndocility, and took his part so warmly in the quarrel with the King,\r\nseems from the first to have obtained a place in his affections greater\r\nthan Edward had ever won. But Clarence had his ambitions; what they\r\nwere and how far they extended the Earl had not as yet discovered.\r\n\r\nWarwick had now the will to play his master's new ministers an ill\r\nturn; that he had also the power to do so none knew better than\r\nhimself. The lands of Neville and Montacute, Beauchamp and Despenser\r\nunited could send into the field a powerful army. Moreover, his\r\nneighbours, in most of the counties where his influence prevailed,\r\nhad bound themselves to him by taking his livery; barons as well as\r\nknights were eager to be of his \"Privy Council,\" to wear his Ragged\r\nStaff and ride in his array. The very aspect of his household seemed\r\nto show the state of a petty king. Every one has read Hollingshead's\r\nfamous description, which tells how the little army of followers which\r\nconstituted his ordinary retinue eat six oxen daily for breakfast.\r\n\r\nNor was it only in the strength of his own retainers that Warwick\r\ntrusted; he knew that he himself was the most popular man in the\r\nkingdom. Men called him ever the friend of the Commons, and \"his open\r\nkitchen persuaded the meaner sort as much as the justice of his cause.\"\r\nHis adversaries, on the other hand, were unmistakably disliked by\r\nthe people. The old partisans of York still looked on the Woodvilles\r\nas Lancastrian renegades, and the grasping avarice of Rivers and his\r\nfamily was stirring up popular demonstration against them even before\r\nWarwick's breach with the King. A great mob in Kent had sacked one\r\nof Rivers' manors and killed his deer in the autumn of 1467, and\r\ntrouble was brewing against him in other quarters. A word of summons\r\nfrom Warwick would call rioters out of the ground in half the shires\r\nof England. Already in January 1468 a French ambassador reports: \"In\r\none county more than three hundred archers were in arms, and had made\r\nthemselves a captain named Robin, and sent to the Earl of Warwick to\r\nknow if it was time to be busy, and to say that all their neighbours\r\nwere ready. But my Lord answered, bidding them go home, for it was not\r\nyet time to be stirring. If the time should come, he would let them\r\nknow.\"[10]\r\n\r\nIt was not only discontented Yorkists that had taken the news of\r\nthe quarrel between Warwick and his master as a signal for moving.\r\nThe tidings had stirred the exiled Lancastrians to a sudden burst\r\nof activity of which we should hardly have thought them capable.\r\nQueen Margaret borrowed ships and money from Louis, and lay in force\r\nat Harfleur. Sir Henry Courtney, heir of the late Earl of Devon,\r\nand Thomas Hungerford, son of the lord who fell at Hexham, tried to\r\nraise an insurrection in the South-West; but they were caught by\r\nLord Stafford of Southwick and beheaded at Salisbury. As a reward\r\nthe King gave Stafford his victim's title of Earl of Devon. In Wales\r\nthe long-wandering Jasper Tudor suddenly appeared, at the head of\r\ntwo thousand men, supported by a small French fleet. He took Harlech\r\nCastle and sacked Denbigh; but a few weeks later Warwick's enemy,\r\nLord Herbert, fell upon him at the head of the Yorkists of the March,\r\nrouted his tumultuary army, retook Harlech, and forced him again to\r\nseek refuge in the hills. Herbert, like Lord Stafford, was rewarded\r\nwith the title of the foe he had vanquished, and became Earl of\r\nPembroke. While these risings were on foot, Lancastrian emissaries were\r\nbusy all over England; but their activity only resulted in a series\r\nof executions. Two gentlemen of the Duke of Norfolk's retinue were\r\nbeheaded for holding secret communication with the Beauforts while\r\nthey were in Flanders, following the train which escorted the Princess\r\nMargaret at her marriage with Charles of Charolois, who had now become\r\nDuke of Burgundy. In London more executions took place, and Sir Thomas\r\nCooke, late Lord Mayor, had all his goods confiscated for misprision\r\nof treason. Two of the Lancastrian emissaries alleged, under torture,\r\nthe one, that Warwick had promised aid to the rising, the other that\r\nLord Wenlock, Warwick's friend and supporter, had guilty knowledge of\r\nthe scheme; but in each case the King himself acknowledged that the\r\naccusation was frivolous--the random imagining of men on the rack,\r\nforced to say something to save their own bones. It was not likely that\r\nWarwick would play the game of Queen Margaret, the slayer of his father\r\nand brother, and the instigator of attempts on his own life.\r\n\r\nStartled by the sudden revival of Lancastrian energy, but encouraged\r\nby the easy way in which he had mastered it, King Edward determined\r\nto give the war-like impulses of his subjects vent by undertaking in\r\nthe next year a great expedition against France. He had the example of\r\nHenry the Fifth before his eyes, and hoped to stifle treason at home by\r\nforeign war. Among his preparations for leaving home was a determined\r\nattempt to open negotiations with Warwick for a reconciliation. The\r\nKing won over the Archbishop of York to plead his cause, by restoring\r\nto him some estates which he had seized in 1467; and about Easter\r\nGeorge Neville induced his brother to meet the King at Coventry.\r\nWarwick came, but it is to be feared that he came fully resolved to\r\nhave his revenge at his own time, with his heart quite unsoftened\r\ntoward his master; yet he spoke the King fair, and even consented to be\r\nreconciled to Lord Herbert, though he would have nothing to say to the\r\nWoodvilles. He was also induced to join the company which escorted the\r\nPrincess Margaret to the coast, on her way to her marriage in Flanders.\r\nAfter this Warwick paid a short visit to London, where he sat among\r\nthe judges who in July tried the Lancastrian conspirators of the city.\r\nClarence accompanied him, and sat on the same bench. He had spent the\r\nlast few months in moving the Pope to grant him a disposition to marry\r\nIsabel Neville,[11] for they were within the prohibited degrees; but\r\nunder pressure from King Edward the Curia had delayed the consideration\r\nof his request.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1468 and the spring of 1469 passed away quietly. Warwick\r\nmade no movement, for he was still perfecting his plans. He saw with\r\nsecret pleasure that the French, with whom peace would have been\r\nmade long ago if his advice had been followed, kept the King fully\r\nemployed. It must have given him peculiar gratification when his enemy\r\nAnthony Woodville, placed at the head of a large fleet, made two most\r\ninglorious expeditions to the French coast, and returned crestfallen\r\nwithout having even seen the enemy.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Earl had been quietly measuring his resources. He had\r\nspoken to all his kinsmen, and secured the full co-operation of the\r\nmajority of them. George the Archbishop of York, Henry Neville heir to\r\nWarwick's aged uncle Lord Latimer, Sir John Coniers of Hornby, husband\r\nof his niece Alice Neville, his cousin Lord Fitzhugh, and Thomas \"the\r\nbastard of Fauconbridge,\" natural son to the deceased peer who had\r\nfought so well at Towton, were his chief reliance. His brother John of\r\nMontagu, the Earl of Northumberland, could not make up his mind; he did\r\nnot reveal Warwick's plans to the King, but he would not promise any\r\naid. William Neville of Abergavenny was now too old to be taken into\r\naccount. The rest of Warwick's uncles and brothers were by this time\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nBy April 1469 the preparations were complete. Every district where the\r\nname of Neville was great had been carefully prepared for trouble.\r\nKent, Yorkshire, and South Wales were ready for insurrection, and yet\r\nall had been done so quietly that the King, who ever since he had\r\nthrown off the Earl's influence had been sinking deeper and deeper into\r\nhabits of careless evil-living and debauchery, suspected nothing.\r\n\r\nIn April Warwick took his wife and daughters across to Calais,\r\napparently to get them out of harm's way. He himself, professing a\r\ngreat wish to see his cousin Margaret, the newly-married Duchess of\r\nBurgundy, went on to St. Omer. He there visited Duke Charles, and was\r\nreconciled to him in spite of the evil memories of their last meeting\r\nat Boulogne. To judge from his conduct, the Earl was bent on nothing\r\nbut a harmless tour; but, as a matter of fact, his movements were\r\nbut a blind destined to deceive King Edward. While he was feasting\r\nat St. Omer he had sent orders over-sea for the commencement of an\r\ninsurrection. In a few days it was timed to break out. Meanwhile\r\nWarwick returned to Calais, and lodged with Wenlock, who was in charge\r\nof the great fortress.\r\n\r\nHis orders had had their effect. In the end of June grave riots broke\r\nout in the neighbourhood of York. Ostensibly they were connected with\r\nthe maladministration of the estates of St. Leonard's hospital in that\r\ncity; but they were in reality political and not agrarian. Within a\r\nfew days fifteen thousand men were at the gates of York, clamorously\r\nsetting forth a string of grievances, which were evidently founded\r\non Cade's manifesto of 1450. Once more we hear of heavy taxation,\r\nmaladministration of the law, the alienation of the royal estates to\r\nupstart favourites, the exclusion from the royal Councils of the great\r\nlords of the royal blood. Once more a demand is made for the punishment\r\nof evil counsellors, and the introduction of economy into the royal\r\nhousehold, and the application of the revenue to the defence of the\r\nrealm. The first leader of the rioters was Robert Huldyard, known as\r\nRobin of Redesdale, no doubt the same Robin whom the Earl had bidden\r\nin 1468 to keep quiet and wait the appointed time. John Neville the\r\nEarl of Northumberland lay at York with a large body of men-at-arms,\r\nfor he was still Lieutenant of the North. Many expected that he would\r\njoin the rioters; but, either because he had not quite recognised the\r\ninsurrection to be his brother's work, or because he had resolved to\r\nadhere loyally to Edward, Montagu surprised the world by attacking the\r\nband which beset York. He routed its vanguard, captured Huldyard, and\r\nhad him beheaded.\r\n\r\nBut this engagement was far from checking the rising. In a week the\r\nwhole of Yorkshire, from Tees to Humber, was up, and it soon became\r\nevident in whose interest the movement was working. New leaders\r\nappeared. Sir John Coniers, the husband of Warwick's niece, and one\r\nof the most influential Yorkists of the North, replaced Huldyard, and\r\nassumed his name of Robin of Redesdale, while with him were Henry\r\nNeville of Latimer and Lord Fitzhugh. Instead of lingering at the gates\r\nof York, the great body of insurgents--rumour made it more than thirty\r\nthousand strong--rolled southward into the Midlands. They were coming,\r\nthey said, to lay their grievances before the King; and in every place\r\nthat they passed they hung their articles, obviously the work of some\r\nold political hand, on the church doors.\r\n\r\nKing Edward seems to have been taken quite unawares by this dangerous\r\ninsurrection. He had kept his eye on Warwick alone, and when Warwick\r\nwas over-sea he thought himself safe. At the end of June he had been\r\nmaking a progress in Norfolk, with no force at his back save two\r\nhundred archers, a bodyguard whom he had raised in 1468 and kept always\r\naround him. Hearing of the stir in Yorkshire, he rode north-ward to\r\nNottingham, calling in such force as could be gathered by the way. As\r\nhe went, news reached him which suddenly revealed the whole scope of\r\nthe insurrection.\r\n\r\nThe moment that his brother's attention was drawn off by the Northern\r\nrising, the Duke of Clarence had quietly slipped over to Calais, and\r\nwith him went George Neville the Archbishop of York. This looked\r\nsuspicious, and the King at once wrote to Clarence, Warwick, and the\r\nArchbishop, bidding them all come to him without delay. Long before\r\nhis orders can have reached them, the tale of treason was out. Within\r\ntwelve hours of Clarence's arrival at Calais the long-projected\r\nmarriage between him and Isabel Neville had been celebrated, in full\r\ndefiance of the King. Warwick and Clarence kept holiday but for one\r\nday; the marriage took place on the 11th, and by the 12th they were in\r\nKent with a strong party of the garrison of Calais as their escort.\r\n\r\nThe unruly Kentishmen rose in a body in Warwick's favour, as eagerly\r\nas when they had mustered to his banner in 1460 before the battle of\r\nNorthampton. The Earl and the Duke came to Canterbury with several\r\nthousand men at their back. There they revealed their treasonable\r\nintent, for they published a declaration that they considered the\r\narticles of Robin of Redesdale just and salutary, and would do\r\ntheir best to bring them to the King's notice. How the King was to\r\nbe persuaded was indicated clearly enough, by a proclamation which\r\nsummoned out the whole shire of Kent to join the Earl's banner. Warwick\r\nand his son-in-law then marched on London, which promptly threw open\r\nits gates. The King was thus caught between two fires--the open rebels\r\nlay to the north of him, his brother and cousin with their armed\r\npersuasion to the south.\r\n\r\nEven before Warwick's treason had been known, the King had recognised\r\nthe danger of the northern rising, and sent commissions of array all\r\nover England. Two considerable forces were soon in arms in his behalf.\r\nHerbert, the new Earl of Pembroke, raised fourteen thousand Welsh and\r\nMarchmen at Brecon and Ludlow, and set out eastward. Stafford, the new\r\nEarl of Devon, collected six thousand archers in the South-Western\r\nCounties, and set out northward. The King lay at Nottingham with Lord\r\nHastings, Lord Mountjoy, and the Woodvilles. He seems to have had\r\nnearly fifteen thousand men in his company; but their spirit was bad.\r\n\"Sire,\" said Mountjoy to him in full council of war, \"no one wishes\r\nyour person ill, but it would be well to send away my Lord of Rivers\r\nand his children when you have done conferring with them.\" Edward took\r\nthis advice. Rivers and John Woodville forthwith retired to Chepstow;\r\nScales joined his sister the Queen at Cambridge.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Northern rebels were pouring south by way of Doncaster\r\nand Derby. Their leaders Coniers and Latimer showed considerable\r\nmilitary skill, for by a rapid march on to Leicester they got between\r\nthe King and Lord Herbert's army. Edward, for once out-generalled, had\r\nto follow them southward, but the Yorkshiremen were some days ahead\r\nof him, and on July 25th reached Daventry. On the same day Herbert\r\nand Stafford concentrated their forces at Banbury; but on their first\r\nmeeting the two new earls fell to hard words on a private quarrel, and,\r\nalthough the enemy was so near, Stafford in a moment of pique drew off\r\nhis six thousand men to Deddington, ten miles away, leaving Pembroke's\r\nfourteen thousand Welsh pikemen altogether unprovided with archery.\r\n\r\nNext day all the chief actors in the scene were converging on the same\r\nspot in central England--Coniers marching from Daventry on to Banbury,\r\nPembroke from Banbury on Daventry, with Stafford following in his\r\nrear, while Warwick and Clarence had left London and were moving by\r\nSt. Albans on Towcester; the King, following the Yorkshiremen, was\r\nsomewhere near Northampton.\r\n\r\nConiers and his colleagues, to whom belong all the honours of\r\ngeneralship in this campaign, once more got ahead of their opponents.\r\nMoving rapidly on Banbury on the 26th, they found Pembroke's army\r\napproaching them on a common named Danesmoor, near Edgecott Park,\r\nsix miles north of Banbury. The Welsh took up a position covered by\r\na small stream and offered battle, though they were greatly inferior\r\nin numbers. The Northerners promptly attacked them, and though one\r\nof their three leaders, Henry Neville of Latimer, fell in the first\r\nonset, gained a complete victory; \"by force of archery they forced the\r\nWelsh to descend from the hill into the valley,\" though Herbert and\r\nhis brothers did all that brave knights could to save the battle. The\r\nKing was only a few hours' march away; indeed, his vanguard under Sir\r\nGeoffrey Gate and Thomas Clapham actually reached the field, but both\r\nwere old officers of Warwick, and instead of falling on the rebels'\r\nrear, proceeded to join them, and led the final attack on Herbert's\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThunderstruck at the deep demoralisation among his troops which this\r\ndesertion showed, the King fell back on Olney, abandoning Northampton\r\nto the rebels. Next day--it was July 27th--the brave Earl of Pembroke\r\nand his brother Richard Herbert, both of whom had been taken prisoners,\r\nwere beheaded in the market-place by Coniers' command without sentence\r\nor trial. Their blood lies without doubt on Warwick's head, for though\r\nneither he nor Clarence was present, the rebels were obviously acting\r\non his orders, and if he had instructed them to keep all their\r\ncaptives safe, they would never have presumed to slay them. Several\r\nchroniclers indeed say that Warwick and Clarence had expressly doomed\r\nHerbert for death. This slaughter was perfectly inexcusable, for\r\nHerbert had never descended to the acts of the Woodvilles; he was an\r\nhonourable enemy, and Warwick had actually been reconciled to him only\r\na year before.[12] The execution of the Herberts was not the only token\r\nof the fact that the great Earl's hand was pulling the strings all over\r\nEngland. His special aversions, Rivers and John Woodville, were seized\r\na week later at Chepstow by a band of rioters--probably retainers from\r\nthe Despenser estates by the Severn--and forwarded to Coventry, where\r\nthey were put to death early in August. Even if Pembroke's execution\r\nwas the unauthorised work of Coniers and Fitzhugh, this slaying of the\r\nWoodvilles must certainly have been Warwick's own deed. Stafford the\r\nEarl of Devon, whose desertion of the Welsh had been the principal\r\ncause of the defeat at Edgecott, fared no better than the colleague\r\nhe had betrayed. He disbanded his army and fled homeward; but at\r\nBridgewater he was seized by insurgents, retainers of the late Earl of\r\nDevon whom he had beheaded a year before, and promptly put to death.\r\n\r\nIt only remains to relate King Edward's fortunes. When the news of\r\nEdgecott fight reached his army, it disbanded for the most part, and he\r\nwas left, with no great following, at Olney, whither he had fallen back\r\non July 27th. Meanwhile Warwick and Clarence, marching from London on\r\nNorthampton along the Roman road, were not far off. The news of the\r\nKing's position reached their army, and George Neville the Archbishop\r\nof York, who was with the vanguard, resolved on a daring stroke. Riding\r\nup by night with a great body of horse he surrounded Olney; the King's\r\nsentinels kept bad watch, and at midnight Edward was roused by the\r\nclash of arms at his door. He found the streets full of Warwick's men,\r\nand the Archbishop waiting in his ante-chamber. The smooth prelate\r\nentered and requested him to rise and dress himself. \"Then the King\r\nsaid he would not, for he had not yet had his rest; but the Archbishop,\r\nthat false and disloyal priest, said to him a second time, 'Sire, you\r\nmust rise and come to see my brother of Warwick, nor do I think that\r\nyou can refuse me.' So the King, fearing worse might come to him, rose\r\nand rode off to meet his cousin of Warwick.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl meanwhile had passed on to Northampton, where he met the\r\nNorthern rebels on July 29th, and thanked them for the good service\r\nthey had done England. There he dismissed the Kentish levies which had\r\nfollowed him from London, and moved on to Coventry escorted by the\r\nYorkshiremen, many of whom must have been his own tenants. At Coventry\r\nthe Archbishop, and his unwilling companion the King, overtook them.\r\nThe details of the meeting of Warwick and Clarence with their captive\r\nmaster have not come down to us. But apparently Edward repaid the\r\nEarl's guile of the past year by an equally deceptive mask of good\r\nhumour. He made no reproaches about the death of his adherents, signed\r\neverything that was required of him, and did not attempt to escape.\r\nThe first batch of privy seals issued under Warwick's influence are\r\ndated from Coventry on August 2nd.\r\n\r\nThe great Earl's treacherous plans had been crowned with complete\r\nsuccess. He had shown that half England would rise at his word; his\r\nenemies were dead; his master was in his power. Yet he found that\r\nhis troubles were now beginning, instead of reaching their end. It\r\nwas not merely that the whole kingdom had been thrown into a state\r\nof disturbance, and that men had commenced everywhere to settle\r\nold quarrels with the sword--the Duke of Norfolk, for example,\r\nwas besieging the Paston's castle of Caistor, and the Commons of\r\nNorthumberland were up in arms demanding the restoration of the Percies\r\nto their heritage. These troubles might be put down by the strong\r\narm of Warwick; but the problem of real difficulty was to arrange a\r\n_modus vivendi_ with the King. Edward was no coward or weakling to be\r\nfrightened into good behaviour by a rising such as had just occurred.\r\nHow could he help resenting with all his passionate nature the violence\r\nof which he had been the victim? His wife, too, would always be at his\r\nside; and though natural affection was not Elizabeth Woodville's strong\r\npoint,[13] still she was far too ambitious and vindictive to pardon\r\nthe deaths of her father and brother. Warwick knew Edward well enough\r\nto realise that for the future there could never be true confidence\r\nbetween them again, and that for the rest of his life he must guard his\r\nhead well against his master's sword.\r\n\r\nBut the Earl was proud and self-reliant; he determined to face the\r\ndanger and release the King. No other alternative was before him, save,\r\nindeed, to slay Edward and proclaim his own son-in-law, Clarence,\r\nfor King. But the memory of old days spent in Edward's cause was too\r\nstrong. Clarence, too, though he may have been willing enough to\r\nsupplant his brother, made no open proposals to extinguish him.\r\n\r\nEdward was over a month in his cousin's hands. Part of the time he was\r\nkept at Warwick and Coventry, but the last three weeks were spent in\r\nthe Earl's northern stronghold of Middleham. The few accounts which we\r\nhave of the time seem to show that the King was all smoothness and fair\r\npromises; the Earl and the Archbishop, on the other hand, were careful\r\nto make his detention as little like captivity as could be managed.\r\nHe was allowed free access to every one, and permitted to go hunting\r\nthree or four miles away from the castle in company with a handful\r\nof the Earl's servants. Warwick at the same time gave earnest of his\r\nadherence to the Yorkist cause by putting down two Lancastrian risings,\r\nthe one in favour of the Percies, led by Robin of Holderness, the other\r\nraised by his own second-cousin, Sir Humphrey Neville, one of the elder\r\nbranch, who was taken and beheaded at York.\r\n\r\nBefore releasing the King, Warwick exacted a few securities from him.\r\nThe first was a general pardon to himself, Clarence, and all who had\r\nbeen engaged in the rising of Robin of Redesdale. The second was a\r\ngrant to himself of the chamberlainship of South Wales, and the right\r\nto name the governors of Caermarthen and the other South Welsh castles.\r\nThese offices had been in Herbert's hands, and the Earl had found that\r\nthey cramped his own power in Glamorganshire and the South Marches.\r\nThe third was the appointment as Treasurer of Sir John Langstrother,\r\nthe Prior of the Hospitallers of England; he was evidently chosen as\r\nRivers' successor, because two years before he had been elected to\r\nhis place as prior in opposition to John Woodville, whom the King had\r\nendeavoured to foist on the order. The chancellorship, however, was\r\nstill left in the hands of Bishop Stillington, against whom no one had\r\na grudge; George Neville did not claim his old preferment.\r\n\r\nBy October the King was back in London, which he entered in great\r\nstate, escorted by Montagu, the Archbishop, Richard of Gloucester, and\r\nthe Earls of Essex and Arundel. \"The King himself,\" writes one of the\r\nPastons that day, \"hath good language of my Lords of Clarence, Warwick,\r\nand York, saying they be his best friends; but his household have other\r\nlanguage, so that what shall hastily fall I can not say.\" No more, we\r\nmay add, could any man in England, the King and Warwick included.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Letter of William Monipenny to Louis the Eleventh. He\r\ncalls it _le pays de Surfiorkshire_, a cross between Suffolk and\r\nYorkshire. But the latter must be meant, as Warwick had no interest in\r\nSuffolk, and the captain is obviously Robin of Redesdale.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Clarence's mother was Isabel's great aunt.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: It is fair to say that Herbert was universally disliked;\r\nhe was called the Spoiler of the Church and the Commons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: As witness her dealings with Richard the Third after he\r\nhad murdered her sons.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nWARWICK FOR KING HENRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peace between Warwick and King Edward lasted for a period even\r\nshorter than might have been expected; seven months, from September\r\n1469 to March 1470, was the term for which it was destined to endure.\r\nYet while it did hold firm, all was so smooth outwardly that its\r\nrupture came as a thunderclap upon the world. Nothing, indeed, could\r\nhave looked more promising for lovers of quiet times than the events of\r\nthe winter of 1469-70. A Parliament ratified all the King's grants of\r\nimmunity to the insurgents of the last year, and while it sat the King\r\nannounced a project which promised to bind York and Neville more firmly\r\ntogether than ever. Edward, though now married for six years, had no\r\nson; three daughters alone were the issue of his union with Elizabeth\r\nWoodville. He now proposed to marry his eldest daughter, and heiress\r\npresumptive, to the male heir of the Nevilles, the child George, son of\r\nMontagu.[14] To make the boy's rank suitable to his prospects, Edward\r\ncreated him Duke of Bedford. Montagu had not joined with his brothers\r\nin the rising, and had even fought with Robin of Redesdale, so it was\r\nall the easier for the King to grant him this crowning honour.\r\n\r\nIn February Warwick was at Warwick Castle, Montagu in the North, while\r\nClarence and King Edward lay at London. All was quiet enough, when\r\nsuddenly there came news of troubles in Lincolnshire. Riotous bands,\r\nheaded by Sir Robert Welles, son of Lord Willoughby and Welles, had\r\ncome together, sacked the manor of a certain Sir Thomas Burgh, one of\r\nEdward's most trusted servants, and were raising the usual seditious\r\ncries about the evil government of the realm. At first nothing very\r\ndangerous seemed to be on foot. When the King sent for Willoughby, to\r\ncall him to account for his son's doings, the old peer came readily\r\nenough to London to make his excuses, relying on the safe conduct\r\nwhich was sent him. But the riots were now swelling into a regular\r\ninsurrection, and soon news came that Sir Robert Welles had called out\r\nthe whole shire-force of Lincoln, mustered fifteen thousand men, and\r\nwas bidding his troops to shout for King Henry. Edward at once issued\r\ncommissions of array for raising an overwhelming force against the\r\nrebels. Two of the commissions were sent to Warwick and Clarence, who\r\nwere bidden to collect the men of Warwickshire and Worcestershire.\r\nTheir orders were dated March 7th, but before they were half carried\r\nout, the purpose for which they were issued had already been attained.\r\nEdward, taking Lord Willoughby with him as a hostage, had rushed north\r\nwith one of these astonishing bursts of energy of which he was now and\r\nagain capable. Leaving London on the 6th, he reached Stamford on March\r\n11th, with the forces of the home and eastern counties at his back.\r\nOn the 12th he met the rebels at Empingham near Stamford, and when\r\nWelles would not bid them disperse, beheaded his aged father Willoughby\r\nin front of his army. The Lincolnshire men fled in disgraceful rout\r\nbefore the fire of the King's artillery, casting off their cassocks\r\nwith the colours of Welles in such haste that the fight was known as\r\nLose-coat Field. Sir Robert was caught and beheaded at Doncaster a\r\nfew days later, and the rising was at an end. On Tuesday the 21st the\r\nKing reviewed his troops: \"It was said that never were seen in England\r\nso many goodly men, and so well arrayed for a fight; in especial the\r\nDuke of Norfolk was worshipfully accompanied, no lord there so well.\"\r\nWarwick and Clarence, with a few thousand men from the shires they\r\nhad been told to raise, lay that day at Chesterfield, converging, in\r\naccordance with their orders, on Lincoln.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Edward announced to his army that he had learnt from the\r\ndying confession of Sir Robert Welles that Warwick and Clarence were\r\nimplicated in the rising. Though Welles had sometimes used King Henry's\r\nname, it was now said that he had really been proposing to place\r\nClarence on the throne, and was acting with Warwick's full approval.\r\nEdward added that he had already sent to the Duke and the Earl, bidding\r\nthem come to his presence at once and unaccompanied. They had refused\r\nto come without a safe conduct, so he now proclaimed them traitors, but\r\nwould grant them their lives if they would appear before him in humble\r\nand obeisant wise within a week. The army was at once directed to march\r\non Chesterfield, but when the proclamation reached Warwick and Clarence\r\nthey did not obey it, and fled for their lives.\r\n\r\nThis series of events is the most puzzling portion of the whole of\r\nWarwick's life. The chroniclers help us very little, and the only two\r\nfirst-hand documents which we possess are official papers drawn up\r\nby King Edward. These papers were so widely spread that we meet them\r\nrepeated word for word and paragraph for paragraph even in the French\r\nwriters,--with the names, of course, horribly mangled.[15] Edward said\r\nthat down to the very moment of Welles' capture he had no thought but\r\nthat Warwick and Clarence were serving him faithfully: it was Welles'\r\nconfession, and some treasonable papers found on the person of a squire\r\nin the Duke of Clarence's livery who was slain in the pursuit, that\r\nrevealed the plot to him. The second document which the King published\r\nwas Welles' confession, a rambling effusion which may or may not fully\r\nrepresent the whole story. Why Welles should confess at all we cannot\r\nsee, unless he expected to save his life thereby; and if he expected to\r\nsave his life he would, of course, insert in his tale whatever names\r\nthe King chose. Welles' narrative relates that all Lincolnshire was\r\nafraid that the King would visit it with vengeance for joining Robin\r\nof Redesdale last year. Excitement already prevailed, when there came\r\nto him, about February 2nd, Sir John Clare, a chaplain of the Duke\r\nof Clarence's, who asked him if Lincolnshire would be ready to rise\r\nsupposing there was another trouble this year, but bade him make no\r\nstir till the Duke should send him word. Without waiting, according\r\nto his own tale, for any further communication, Welles raised all\r\nLincolnshire, making proclamation in the King's name as well as that of\r\nthe Duke of Clarence. Some days after the riots began there came to him\r\na squire in the Duke's livery, who told him that he had provoked the\r\nKing, and that great multitudes of the Commons must needs die unless\r\nthey bestirred themselves. So this squire--Welles could not give his\r\nsurname but only knew that he was called Walter--took over the guiding\r\nof the host till he was slain at Stamford. Moreover, one John Wright\r\ncame to Lincoln, bearing a ring as token, which he said belonged to the\r\nEarl of Warwick, with a message of comfort to say that the Earl had\r\nsworn to take such part as Lincolnshire should take. \"And I understand\r\nthat they intended to make great risings, and as far as ever I could\r\nunderstand, to the intent to make the Duke of Clarence King, and so it\r\nwas largely noised in our host.\" According to his story, Welles had\r\nnever seen either Warwick or Clarence himself, and had no definite\r\nknowledge of their purpose. He only understood that the purpose was to\r\ncrown Clarence; all his information came from Clare and the anonymous\r\nsquire.\r\n\r\nThis is a curious tale, and suggests many doubts. If Warwick wished\r\nto act again the comedy of last year, why should he send to a county\r\nwhere he had no influence, to a staunch Lancastrian family (Welles'\r\ngrandfather fell in Henry's cause at Towton, and his father was the\r\nWilloughby who tried to kidnap Warwick in 1460) in order to provoke a\r\nrising? And if he had planned a rising in Lincoln, why did he make no\r\nattempt to support it by calling out his own Midland and South Welsh\r\nretainers, or raising Yorkshire or Kent, where he could command the\r\nwhole county? That the Earl was capable of treasonable double-dealing\r\nhe had shown clearly enough in 1469. But was he capable of such insane\r\nbad management as the arrangements for Welles' insurrection show? Last\r\nyear his own relatives and retainers worked the plan, and it was most\r\naccurately timed and most successfully executed. Why should he now make\r\nsuch a bungle?\r\n\r\nIt is, moreover, to be observed that while Welles puts everything down\r\nto Clarence in his confession, Warkworth and other chroniclers say that\r\nhe bade his men shout for King Henry, and all his connections were\r\ncertainly Lancastrian. Is it possible that he was trying to put the\r\nguilt off his own shoulders, and to make a bid for his life, acting on\r\nEdward's hints, when he implicated Warwick and Clarence in his guilt?\r\n\r\nIt is certainly quite in keeping with Edward's character to suppose\r\nthat, finding himself at the head of a loyal and victorious army, it\r\nsuddenly occurred to him that his position could be utilised to fall on\r\nWarwick and Clarence and take his revenge for the deaths of Pembroke\r\nand Rivers.\r\n\r\nWhether this was so or not, the Duke and the Earl were most certainly\r\ncaught unprepared when Edward marched on Chesterfield. They left a\r\nmessage that they would come to the King if he would give them a\r\nsafe conduct, and fled to Manchester. Edward threw his army between\r\nthem and York, where they could have raised men in abundance, and\r\nthe fugitives, after vainly trying to interest Lord Stanley in their\r\ncause, doubled back on the Midlands. With a few hundred men in their\r\ntrain they got to Warwick, but apparently there was no time to make a\r\nstand even there. The King had sent commissions of array out all over\r\nEngland to trusty hands, and forces under staunch Yorkists were closing\r\nin towards the Midlands on every side. Edward calculated on having an\r\nenormous army in the field by April; he himself was coming south with\r\nquite twenty thousand victorious troops, and he had called out the\r\nwhole of the levies of Shropshire, Hereford, Gloucester, Stafford,\r\nWiltshire, Devon, Dorset, and Somerset. When he heard that Warwick was\r\nmoving south, he sent to Salisbury to order quarters and provisions for\r\nforty thousand men, who would be concentrated there if the Earl tried\r\nto reach the Montacute lands in that quarter.\r\n\r\nSo unprepared was the Earl for the assault that, packing up his\r\nvaluables in Warwick Castle, and taking with him his wife and his two\r\ndaughters, he fled for the South Coast without waiting to be surrounded\r\nby his enemies. He quite outstripped the King, who had barely reached\r\nSalisbury when he himself was at Exeter. There the Duke and Earl\r\nseized a few ships, which they sent round to Dartmouth; more vessels\r\nwere obtained in the latter place, for the whole seafaring population\r\nof England favoured the Earl. When Edward drew near, Warwick and his\r\nson-in-law went on board their hastily-extemporised fleet and put\r\nto sea. They ran along the South Coast as far as Southampton, where\r\nthey made an attempt to seize a part of the royal navy, including the\r\ngreat ship called the _Trinity_, which had lain there since Scales'\r\nabortive expedition in 1469. But Scales and Howard occupied the town\r\nwith a great Hampshire levy; the Earl's attack failed, and three of his\r\nships with their crews fell into the enemy's hands. Tiptoft Earl of\r\nWorcester, \"the great butcher of England,\" tried the captured men, and\r\na squire named Clapham and nineteen more were hung and then impaled by\r\nhim. This atrocious punishment sent a shock of horror through England,\r\nand Tiptoft's name is still remembered rather for this abomination than\r\nfor all the learning and accomplishments which made him Caxton's idol.\r\n\r\nWarwick made for Calais, where his friend Wenlock was in charge,\r\nexpecting free admittance. But the King had sent Galliard de Duras\r\nand other officers across to watch the governor, and Wenlock, who was\r\nsomewhat of a time-server, dared not show his heart. When Warwick\r\nappeared in the roads he refused him entry, and shot off some harmless\r\ncannon toward the ships. At the same time he sent the Earl a secret\r\nmessage that \"he would give him a fair account of Calais upon the first\r\nopportunity, if he would betake himself to France and wait.\" While\r\nWarwick lay off Calais his daughter, Clarence's wife, was delivered of\r\na son. Wenlock sent out for her use two flagons of wine, but would not\r\ngive her a safe conduct to land--\"a great severity for a servant to use\r\ntowards his lord,\" remarks Commines.\r\n\r\nRepulsed from Calais, though we hear that the majority of the garrison\r\nand inhabitants wished to admit them, Warwick and Clarence turned back,\r\nand sought refuge in the harbour of Honfleur, where they trusted to get\r\nshelter from Louis of France. On their way between Calais and Honfleur\r\nthey made prizes of several ships belonging to the Duke of Burgundy,\r\nbecause they understood that he was arming against them. Louis kept\r\naway from Warwick for a time; but he sent his secretary, Du Plessis, to\r\nsee him, and his admiral, the Bastard of Bourbon, gave the fugitives a\r\nhearty welcome. Louis was still at war with England, and still dreading\r\na descent by King Edward on the French coast. He was delighted to\r\nlearn that he could now turn Warwick, whose abilities he had learnt\r\nto respect, against his master--anything that would breed trouble in\r\nEngland would keep his enemy occupied at home. The King's first orders\r\nto his officers were to allow Warwick to fit out his ships, give him a\r\nsupply of money, and send him off to England as quickly as possible.\r\nBut the narrow seas were too well watched. Charles the Bold, irritated\r\nat Warwick's capture of his merchantmen, had collected a great fleet\r\nof seventy sail, which swept the Channel and watched the mouth of the\r\nSeine.\r\n\r\nThe enforced delay in Warwick's departure allowed time for a new idea\r\nto ripen in the French King's restless brain. Warwick had now broken\r\nhopelessly with King Edward; they could never trust each other again.\r\nWhy therefore should not the Earl reconcile himself to the cause of\r\nLancaster? No sooner was the idea formed than Louis proceeded to send\r\nfor Queen Margaret out of her refuge in the duchy of Bar, and to lay\r\nhis plan before her and the Earl, when they all met at Angers in the\r\nmiddle of July.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was at first sight revolting to both parties. There was so\r\nmuch blood and trouble between them that neither could stomach the\r\nproposal. If Margaret could bring herself to forget that Warwick had\r\ntwice driven her out of England, and had led her husband in ignominy to\r\nthe Tower, she could not pardon the man who, in his moment of wrath,\r\nhad stigmatised herself as an adulteress and her son as a bastard.[16]\r\nWarwick, on the other hand, if he could forgive the plot against\r\nhis own life which the Queen had hatched in 1459, could not bear to\r\nthink of meeting the woman who had sent his gray-haired father to the\r\nscaffold in cold blood on the day after Wakefield. King Louis asked\r\neach party to forget their whole past careers, and sacrifice their\r\ndearest hatreds to the exigencies of the moment.\r\n\r\nIf Warwick and Queen Margaret had been left to themselves, it is most\r\nimprobable that they would ever have come to an agreement. But between\r\nthem Louis went busily to and fro, for his unscrupulous mind was\r\nperfectly unable to conceive that passion or sentiment could override\r\nan obvious political necessity. Gradually the two parties were brought\r\nto state their objections to the King's scheme, the first step towards\r\nthe commencement of negotiations. Warwick was the first to yield; the\r\nQueen took far longer to persuade. The Earl, she said, had been the\r\ncause of all the trouble that had come on herself, her husband, and\r\nher son. She could not pardon him. Moreover, his pardon would lose\r\nher more friends than he could bring to her. Warwick's answer was\r\nstraightforward. He owned all the harm he had done to her and hers.\r\nBut the offence, he said, had come first from her who had plotted\r\nevil against him which he had never deserved. What he had done had\r\nbeen done solely in his own defence. But now the new King had broken\r\nfaith with him, and he was bound to him no longer. If Margaret would\r\nforgive him, he would be true to her henceforth; and for that the King\r\nof France would be his surety. Louis gave his word, praying the Queen\r\nto pardon the Earl, to whom, he said, he was more beholden than to any\r\nother man living.[17]\r\n\r\nThe Queen so pressed, and urged beside by the counsellors of her father\r\nKing Réné, agreed to pardon Warwick. Louis then broached the second\r\npoint in his scheme. The new alliance, he urged, should be sealed by\r\na marriage; the Prince of Wales was now seventeen and the Lady Anne,\r\nWarwick's younger daughter, sixteen. What match could be fairer or more\r\nhopeful?\r\n\r\nBut to this the Queen would not listen. She could find a better match\r\nfor her son, she said; and she showed them a letter lately come from\r\nEdward offering him the hand of the young Princess Elizabeth.[18]\r\nLouis, however, was quietly persistent, and in the end the Queen\r\nyielded this point also. On August 4th she met Warwick in the Church of\r\nSt. Mary at Angers, and there they were reconciled; the Earl swearing\r\non a fragment of the true cross that he would cleave to King Henry's\r\nquarrel, the Queen engaging to treat the Earl as her true and faithful\r\nsubject, and never to make him any reproach for deeds gone by. The Earl\r\nplaced his daughter in the Queen's hands, saying that the marriage\r\nshould take place only when he had won back England for King Henry, and\r\nthen departed for the coast to make preparations for getting his fleet\r\nto sea.\r\n\r\nOne person alone was much vexed at the success of Louis' scheme. The\r\nDuke of Clarence had no wish to see his father-in-law reconciled to\r\nthe house of Lancaster, for he had been speculating on the notion\r\nthat if Warwick drove out Edward he himself would become King. But\r\nwandering exiles must take their fortune as it comes, and Clarence had\r\nto be contented with Queen Margaret's promise that his name should be\r\ninserted in the succession after that of her son, when she and her\r\nhusband came to their own again. The Prince was a healthy promising\r\nlad, and the prospect offered was hopelessly remote; Clarence began to\r\ngrow discontented, and to regret that he had ever placed himself under\r\nWarwick's guidance. At this juncture his brother sent him a message\r\nfrom England, through a lady attending on the Duchess, praying him\r\nnot to wreck the fortunes of his own family by adhering to the house\r\nof Lancaster, and bidding him remember the hereditary hatred that\r\nlay between them. Edward offered his brother a full pardon. Clarence\r\nreplied by promising to come over to the King so soon as he and Warwick\r\nshould reach England. Of all these negotiations Warwick suspected not a\r\nword.\r\n\r\nEdward was so overjoyed by his brother's engagement to wreck the Earl's\r\ninvasion, that he laughed at Charles of Burgundy for squandering money\r\nin keeping a fleet at sea to intercept Warwick, and declared that what\r\nhe most wished was to see his adversary safely landed on English soil,\r\nto be dealt with by himself.\r\n\r\nHe had his wish soon enough. In September the equinoctial gales caught\r\nthe Burgundian fleet and blew it to the four winds, some of the vessels\r\nbeing driven as far as Scotland and Denmark. This left the coast clear\r\nfor Warwick, who had long been waiting to put to sea. The Earl had\r\nalready taken his precautions to make his task easy. A proclamation,\r\nsigned by himself and Clarence, had been scattered all over England by\r\nwilling hands. It said that the exiles were returning \"to set right and\r\njustice to their places, and to reduce and redeem for ever the realm\r\nfrom its thraldom;\" but no mention was made either of Edward or Henry\r\nin it, a curious fact which seems to point out that the Lancastrian\r\nalliance was not to be avowed till the last moment. But more useful\r\nthan many proclamations was the message which the Earl sent into the\r\nNorth Country; he prayed his kinsman Fitzhugh to stir up Yorkshire and\r\ndraw the King northward, as he had done before, when he and Coniers\r\nworked the rebellion of Robin of Redesdale.\r\n\r\nFitzhugh had no difficulty in rousing the Neville tenants about\r\nMiddleham; and Edward, as Warwick expected, no sooner heard of this\r\ninsurrection than he hurried to put it down, taking with him his\r\nbrother Richard of Gloucester, Scales, Hastings, Say, and many more\r\nof his most trusted barons, with a good part of the army that was\r\ndisposable to resist a landing on the South Coast. Near York he was\r\nto be met by Montagu, who had adhered to him for the past year in\r\nspite of his brother's rebellion. But the King had paid Montagu\r\nbadly for his loyalty. He had taken from him the Percy lands in\r\nNorthumberland, and restored them to the young heir of that ancient\r\nhouse, compensating, as he thought, the dispossessed Neville by making\r\nhim a marquis, and handing him over some of Warwick's confiscated\r\nnorthern estates. Montagu complained in secret that \"he had been given\r\na marquisate, and a pie's nest to maintain it withal,\" and was far from\r\nbeing so contented as the King supposed.\r\n\r\nOn September 25th Warwick landed unopposed at Dartmouth. In his company\r\nwas not only Clarence but several of the great Lancastrian lords who\r\nhad been living in exile--Jasper of Pembroke, Oxford, and many more.\r\nThey brought with them about two thousand men, of whom half were French\r\narchers lent by Louis. The moment that the invaders landed, Warwick\r\nand Clarence declared themselves, by putting forth a proclamation in\r\nfavour of King Henry. Devon and Somerset had always been Lancastrian\r\nstrongholds, and the old retainers of the Beauforts and of Exeter came\r\nin by hundreds to meet their exiled lords. In a few days Warwick had\r\nten thousand men, and could march on London; the King was at Doncaster,\r\nand his lieutenants in the South could make no stand without him. A\r\nlittle later Warwick's own Midland and Wiltshire tenants joined him,\r\nthe Earl of Shrewsbury raised the Severn valley in his aid, and all\r\nWestern England was in his hands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile King Edward, who had up to this moment mismanaged his\r\naffairs most hopelessly, moved south by Doncaster and Lincoln, with\r\nMontagu and many other lords in his train. On October 6th he lay in\r\na fortified manor near Nottingham with his bodyguard, while his army\r\noccupied all the villages round about. There, early in the morning,\r\nwhile he still lay in bed, Alexander Carlisle, the chief of his\r\nminstrels, and Master Lee, his chaplain, came running into his chamber,\r\nto tell him there was treachery in his camp. Montagu and other lords\r\nwere riding down the ranks of his army crying, \"God save King Henry!\"\r\nThe men were cheering and shouting for Warwick and Lancaster, and no\r\none was showing any signs of striking a blow for the cause of York.\r\n\r\nEdward rose in haste, drew up his bodyguard to defend the approach\r\nof the manor where he lay, and sent scouts to know the truth of the\r\nreport. They met Montagu marching against them, and fled back to\r\nsay that the rumour was all too true. Then Edward with his brother\r\nGloucester, Hastings his chamberlain, Say, and Scales, and their\r\nimmediate following, took horse and fled. They reached Lynn about eight\r\nhundred strong, seized some merchantmen and two Dutch carvels which\r\nlay in the harbour, and set sail for the lands of Burgundy. Buffeted\r\nby storms and chased by Hanseatic pirates, they ran their ships ashore\r\nnear Alkmaar, and sought refuge with Louis of Gruthuyse, Governor of\r\nHolland. King, lords, and archers alike had escaped with nothing but\r\nwhat they bore on their backs; Edward himself could only pay the master\r\nof the ship that carried him by giving him the rich gown lined with\r\nmartens' fur that he had worn in his flight.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: This plan, as Lingard astutely observes, may have two\r\nmeanings. Either, as we said above, it was a ratification of peace with\r\nthe Nevilles, or--and this is quite possible--it was intended to draw\r\nMontagu apart from his brothers, by giving him a special interest in\r\nEdward's prosperity.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _E.g._ Waurin makes Ranby Howe, the muster-place of the\r\ninsurgents, into Tabihorch, and Lancashire into Lantreghier.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Foreign writers record that Warwick used this language to\r\nthe legate Coppini in 1460.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: All this comes from the invaluable \"Manner of the dealing\r\nof the Earl of Warwick at Angiers,\" printed in the _Chronicle of the\r\nWhite Rose_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: This is a not impossible tale. Edward, fearing Warwick's\r\nalliance to the Queen, might hope to separate them by offering\r\nMargaret's son the ultimate succession to the throne. For he himself\r\nhaving no male heir, the crown would go with his eldest daughter\r\nElizabeth.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF KING EDWARD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe expulsion of King Edward had been marvellously sudden. Within\r\neleven days after his landing at Dartmouth Warwick was master of all\r\nEngland. Not a blow had been struck for the exiled King. From Calais to\r\nBerwick every man mounted the Red Rose or the Ragged Staff with real\r\nor simulated manifestations of joy. On October 6th the Earl reached\r\nLondon, which opened its gates with its accustomed readiness. It had\r\nonly delayed its surrender in fear of a riotous band of Kentishmen,\r\nwhom Sir Geoffrey Gate had gathered in the Earl's name. They had\r\nwrought such mischief in Southwark that the Londoners refused to let\r\nthem in, and waited for the arrival of Warwick himself before they\r\nwould formally acknowledge King Henry. Meanwhile all the partisans of\r\nYork had either fled from the city or taken sanctuary. Queen Elizabeth\r\nsought refuge in the precincts of Westminster, where she was soon after\r\ndelivered of a son, the first male child that had been born to King\r\nEdward.\r\n\r\nRiding through the city Warwick came to the Tower, and found King Henry\r\nin his keeper's hands, \"not worshipfully arrayed as a prince, and not\r\nso cleanly kept as should beseem his state.\" The Earl led him forth\r\nfrom the fortress,--whither he had himself conducted him, a prisoner\r\nin bonds, five years before,--arrayed him in royal robes, and brought\r\nhim in state to St. Paul's, the Lord Mayor and Sheriffs, with all the\r\nCommon Council, walking before him, \"while all the people to right and\r\nleft rejoiced with clapping of hands, and cried 'God save King Henry!'\"\r\nThen the King, after returning thanks for his deliverance in the\r\nCathedral, rode down Cheapside and took up his residence in the palace\r\nof the Bishop of London.\r\n\r\nHenry was much broken and enfeebled by his captivity. \"He sat on his\r\nthrone as limp and helpless as a sack of wool,\" says one unfriendly\r\nchronicler. \"He was a mere shadow and pretence, and what was done in\r\nhis name was done without his will and knowledge.\" All that remained\r\nunbroken in him was his piety and his imperturbable long-suffering\r\npatience. But his weakness only made him the more fit for Warwick's\r\npurpose. His deliverance took place on the 6th, and on October 9th\r\nwe find him beginning to sign a long series of documents which\r\nreconstituted the government of the realm. It was made clear from the\r\nfirst that Warwick and his friends were to have charge of the King\r\nrather than the Lancastrian peers. In the first batch of appointments\r\nWarwick became the King's Lieutenant, and resumed his old posts of\r\nCaptain of Calais and Admiral. George Neville was restored to the\r\nChancellorship, and Sir John Langstrother, Prior of the Hospitallers,\r\nreceived again the Treasury, which Warwick had bestowed on him in\r\n1469. The Duke of Clarence was made Lieutenant of Ireland, a post\r\nhe had enjoyed under his brother till his exile in 1470. Among the\r\nLancastrians, Oxford was made Constable, and Pembroke joint-Lieutenant\r\nunder Warwick. The rest received back their confiscated lands, but got\r\nno official preferment.\r\n\r\nOxford's first exercise of his power as Constable was to try Tiptoft\r\nEarl of Worcester, one of the few of King Edward's adherents whom no\r\none could pardon. Oxford had to avenge on him his father and brother,\r\nwhom the Earl had sentenced to be drawn and quartered in 1462, while\r\nWarwick remembered his adherents impaled in the previous April. The\r\nButcher of England got no mercy, as might be expected, and was beheaded\r\non October 18th.\r\n\r\nA few days before summonses had been sent out in the King's name for\r\na Parliament to meet on November 26th, for Warwick was eager to set\r\nhimself right with the nation at the earliest opportunity. Every care\r\nwas taken to show that the new rule was to be one of tolerance and\r\namnesty. The whole of the surviving peers who had sat in Edward's\r\nlast Parliament were invited to present themselves to meet King\r\nHenry--however bitter their Yorkist partizanship had been--save\r\nsix only, and of these four had fled over-sea--Gloucester, Scales,\r\nHastings, and Say.\r\n\r\nThe Parliament met and was greeted by George Neville the Chancellor\r\nwith a sermon adapted to the times, on the text from Jeremiah, \"Turn,\r\nO ye back-sliding children.\" The proceedings of the session are lost,\r\nbut we know that they were mainly formal, confirming the King's\r\nappointments to offices, ratifying the agreement made between Queen\r\nMargaret and Clarence, that the latter should be declared heir to\r\nthe throne failing issue to the Prince of Wales, and reversing the\r\nattainder of Somerset and Exeter and the other Lancastrian lords, who\r\nwere thus able to take their seats in the Upper House.\r\n\r\nThe most important political event of the restoration, however, was\r\nthe conclusion of the treaty with France, which Warwick had had so\r\nclose to his heart ever since the first abortive negotiations in\r\n1464. An embassy, headed by the Bishop of Bayeux, titular Patriarch\r\nof Jerusalem, appeared in London when Warwick's power was firmly\r\nestablished, and a peace for twelve years and treaty of alliance was\r\nduly concluded. Its most important feature was that it bound England\r\nto take the French King's side in the struggle with Burgundy. When he\r\nheard that Edward had been expelled and could no longer aid Charles\r\nthe Bold, Louis had at once attacked the towns on the Somme, and taken\r\nAmiens and several other important places. Next spring his contest\r\nwith the Duke would begin in earnest, and he was overjoyed to know\r\nthat the English power would be used for his aid, by one who had a\r\nstrong personal dislike to the Burgundian. Warwick at once took steps\r\nto strengthen the garrison of Calais, which was at this time entirely\r\nsurrounded by the Duke's territory, and began to make preparations for\r\na campaign in the next spring.\r\n\r\nIt is rather difficult to gauge with accuracy the feeling with which\r\nEngland received the restoration of King Henry. The nation, however,\r\nseems on the whole to have accepted the new government with great\r\nequanimity if with no very marked enthusiasm. The Lancastrians were\r\nof course contented, though they would have preferred to have won back\r\ntheir position by their own arms. Of the Yorkists it was supposed that\r\nmost of the important sections held by the Earl and not by King Edward.\r\nThis was certainly the case, as later events showed, with the Commons\r\nin most parts of the country, and notably in Yorkshire and Kent, which\r\nhad up to this time been so strongly attached to the cause of York.\r\nThere were, however, classes in which the restoration was not so well\r\nreceived. It was disliked by such of the Yorkist nobility as were not\r\nNevilles. The Duke of Norfolk and all the Bourchier clan--Essex, the\r\nArchbishop, Cromwell, and Berners--had not been displeased when Warwick\r\nchastened the Queen's relatives, but had not wished to see Edward\r\nentirely deposed. Other peers, such as Grey Earl of Kent, and the Earl\r\nof Arundel, had committed themselves even more deeply to Edward's side,\r\nby allying themselves by marriage with the Woodvilles. It was gall\r\nand bitterness to all those heads of great houses to have to seek for\r\npardon and favour from their late enemies. What, for example, must have\r\nbeen Norfolk's feelings when he was compelled, as the Paston records\r\ndescribe, to sue as humbly to the Lancastrian Earl of Oxford as his own\r\ndependents had been wont to sue to himself?\r\n\r\nAnother quarter where the restoration was taken ill was to be found\r\namong the merchants of London. The late King had been a great spender\r\nof money, and was at the moment of his exile deep in the books of many\r\nwealthy purveyors of the luxuries in which he delighted. All these\r\ndebts had now become hopeless, and the unfortunate creditors were\r\nsulky and depressed. Moreover, Edward's courteous and affable manners\r\nand comely person had won him favour in the eyes of the Londoners in\r\nwhose midst he habitually dwelt, and still more so, unless tradition\r\nerrs, in the eyes of their wives. Few persons in the city, except\r\ndeclared Lancastrians, looked upon the new government with any approach\r\nto enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nThere was one individual, too, whose feelings as to the new government\r\nwere likely to be of no mean importance. George of Clarence, though\r\nhe had followed Warwick to London and taken a prominent part in all\r\nthe incidents of the restoration, was profoundly dissatisfied with\r\nhis position. Even when he had been made Lieutenant of Ireland--an\r\noffice which he chose to discharge by deputy--and presented with many\r\nscores of manors, he was in no wise conciliated. He was farther from\r\nthe throne as the Prince of Wales' ultimate heir than he had been in\r\nthe days of his own brother's reign. Had the chance been given him, it\r\nseems likely that he would have betrayed Warwick and joined King Edward\r\nafter his return to England. But events had marched too rapidly, and he\r\nhad found no opportunity to strike a blow for York. During the winter\r\nof 1470-71, however, he put himself once more in communication with his\r\nbrother. The correspondence was carried on through their sisters--the\r\nDuchess of Exeter on the English side of the Channel and the Duchess\r\nof Burgundy over-sea. By this means Clarence renewed his promises of\r\nhelp to Edward, and swore to join him, with every man that he could\r\nraise, the moment that he set foot again in England. Meanwhile Warwick\r\nhad no suspicion of his son-in-law's treachery. He trusted him to the\r\nuttermost, heaped favours upon him, and even got his name joined with\r\nhis own and Pembroke's as Lieutenants for King Henry in all the realm\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nFor five months the Earl's reign was undisturbed. There was no one in\r\nthe country who dared dispute his will. Queen Margaret, whose presence\r\nwould have been his greatest difficulty, had not yet crossed the seas.\r\nHer delay was strange. Perhaps she still dreaded putting herself in the\r\nhands of her old enemy; perhaps the King of France detained her till\r\nWarwick should have made his power in England too firm to be troubled\r\nby her intrigues. But the Earl himself actually desired her presence.\r\nHe several times invited her to hasten her arrival, and at last sent\r\nover Langstrother, the Treasurer of England, to urge his suit and\r\nescort Margaret and her son across the Channel. It was not till March\r\nthat she could be induced to move; and by March the time was overdue.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile King Edward had received but a luke-warm reception at the\r\nCourt of Burgundy. Duke Charles, saddled with his French war, would\r\nhave preferred to keep at peace with England. His sympathies were\r\ndivided between Lancaster and York. If his wife was Edward's sister,\r\nhe himself had Lancastrian blood in his veins, and had long maintained\r\nSomerset, Exeter, and other Lancastrian exiles at his Court. But he\r\nwas driven into taking a decided line in favour of Edward by the\r\nfact that Warwick, his personal enemy, was supreme in the counsels\r\nof England. If the Earl allied himself to Louis of France, it became\r\nabsolutely necessary for Duke Charles to lend his support to his exiled\r\nbrother-in-law, with the object of upsetting Warwick's domination.\r\n\r\nEdward himself had found again his ancient restless energy in the day\r\nof adversity. He knew that in the last autumn he could have made a\r\ngood defence if it had not been for Montagu's sudden treachery, and\r\nwas determined not to consider his cause lost till it had been fairly\r\ntried by the arbitrament of the sword. He was in full communication\r\nwith England, and had learnt that many more beside Clarence were eager\r\nto see him land. The adventure would be perilous, for he would have to\r\nfight not only, as of old, the Lancastrian party, but the vast masses\r\nof the Commons whose trust had always been in the great Earl. But peril\r\nseems to have been rather an incentive than a deterrent to Edward,\r\nwhen the reckless mood was on him. He took the aid that Charles of\r\nBurgundy promised, though it was given in secret and with a grudging\r\nheart. After a final interview with the Duke at Aire, he moved off in\r\nFebruary to Flushing, where a few ships had been collected for him in\r\nthe haven among the marshes of Walcheren. About fifteen hundred English\r\nrefugees accompanied him, including his brother of Gloucester and Lords\r\nHastings, Say, and Scales. The Duke had hired for him three hundred\r\nGerman hand-gun men, and presented him with fifty thousand florins in\r\ngold. With such slender resources the exiled King did not scruple to\r\nattempt the reconquest of his kingdom. On March 11th he and his men set\r\nsail. They were convoyed across the German Ocean by a fleet of fourteen\r\narmed Hanseatic vessels, which the Duke had sent for their protection.\r\nYet the moment that Charles heard they were safely departed, he\r\npublished, for Warwick's benefit, a proclamation warning any of his\r\nsubjects against aiding or abetting Edward of York in any enterprise\r\nagainst the realm of England.\r\n\r\nHowever secretly Edward's preparations were concerted, they had not\r\nentirely escaped his enemy's notice. Warwick had made dispositions\r\nfor resisting a landing to the best of his ability. A fleet stationed\r\nat Calais, under the Bastard of Fauconbridge, watched the straits and\r\nprotected the Kentish coast. The Earl himself lay at London to overawe\r\nthe discontented and guard King Henry. Oxford held command in the\r\nEastern Counties--the most dangerous district, for Norfolk and the\r\nBourchiers were rightly suspected of keeping up communication with\r\nEdward. In the North Montagu and the Earl of Northumberland were in\r\ncharge from Hull to Berwick with divided authority.\r\n\r\nAs Warwick had expected, the invaders aimed at landing in East Anglia.\r\nOn March 12th Edward and his fleet lay off Cromer. He sent two knights\r\nashore to rouse the country ere he himself set foot on land. But in\r\na few hours the messengers returned. They bade him hoist sail again,\r\nfor Oxford was keeping strict watch over all those parts, and Edward's\r\nfriends were all in prison or bound over to good behaviour. On\r\nreceiving this disappointing intelligence, Edward determined on one of\r\nthose bold strokes which were so often his salvation. If the friendly\r\ndistricts were so well watched, it was likely that the counties where\r\nWarwick's interest was supreme would be less carefully secured. The\r\nKing bade his pilot steer north and make for the Humber mouth, though\r\nYorkshire was known to be devoted to the great Earl.\r\n\r\nThat night a gale from the south swept over the Wash and scattered\r\nEdward's ships far and wide. On March 15th it abated, and the vessels\r\ncame to land at various points on the coast of Holderness. The King and\r\nHastings, with five hundred men, disembarked at Ravenspur--a good omen,\r\nfor this was the same spot at which Henry of Bolingbroke had commenced\r\nhis victorious march on London in 1399. The other ships landed their\r\nmen at neighbouring points on the coast, and by the next morning all\r\nEdward's two thousand men were safely concentrated. Their reception\r\nby the country-side was most discouraging. The people deserted their\r\nvillages and drew together in great bands, as if minded to oppose the\r\ninvaders. Indeed, they only needed leaders to induce them to take the\r\noffensive; but no man of mark chanced to be in Holderness. Montagu lay\r\nin the West-Riding and Northumberland in the North. A squire named\r\nDelamere, and a priest named Westerdale, the only leaders whom the men\r\nof Holderness could find, contented themselves with following the King\r\nat a distance, and with sending news of his approach to York.\r\n\r\nA less resolute adventurer than Edward Plantagenet would probably have\r\ntaken to his ships again when he found neither help nor sympathy in\r\nYorkshire. But Edward was resolved to play out his game; the sight of\r\nthe hostile country-side only made him determine to eke out the lion's\r\nhide with the fox's skin. Calling to mind the stratagem which Henry\r\nof Bolingbroke had practised in that same land seventy-two years ago,\r\nhe sent messengers everywhere to announce that he came in arms not to\r\ndispossess King Henry, but only to claim his ancestral duchy of York.\r\nWhen he passed through towns and villages he bade his men shout for\r\nKing Henry, and he himself mounted the Lancastrian badge of the ostrich\r\nfeathers. In these borrowed plumes he came before the walls of York,\r\nstill unmolested, but without having drawn a man to his banners. Hull,\r\nthe largest town that he had approached, had resolutely closed its\r\ngates against him.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Edward's enterprise was settled before the gates of York on\r\nthe morning of March 18th. He found the walls manned by the citizens\r\nin arms; but they parleyed instead of firing upon him, and when he\r\ndeclared that he came in peace, aspiring only to his father's dignity\r\nand possessions, he himself with sixteen persons only in his train\r\nwas admitted within the gate. Then upon the cross of the high altar\r\nin the Minster he swore \"that he never would again take upon himself\r\nto be King of England, nor would have done before that time, but for\r\nthe exciting and stirring of the Earl of Warwick,\" \"and thereto before\r\nall the people he cried, 'King Harry! King Harry and Prince Edward!'\"\r\nSatisfied by these protestations, the men of York admitted the invaders\r\nwithin their walls. Edward, however, only stayed for twelve hours in\r\nYork, and next morning he marched on Tadcaster.\r\n\r\nThis day was almost as critical as the last. It was five days since\r\nthe landing at Ravenspur, and the news had now had time to spread.\r\nIf Montagu and Northumberland were bent on loyal service to King\r\nHenry, they must now be close at hand. But the star of York was in the\r\nascendant. Northumberland remembered at this moment rather his ancient\r\nenmity for the Nevilles than his grandfather's loyalty to Lancaster.\r\nHe gathered troops indeed, but he made no attempt to march south or\r\nto intercept the invaders. It is probable that he was actually in\r\ntreasonable communication with Edward, as the Lancastrian chroniclers\r\ndeclare. Montagu, on the other hand, collected two or three thousand\r\nmen and threw himself into Pontefract, to guard the Great North Road.\r\nBut Edward, instead of approaching Pontefract, moved his army on to\r\ncross-roads, which enabled him to perform a flank march round his\r\nadversary; he slept that evening at Sendal Castle, the spot where his\r\nfather had spent the night before the disastrous battle of Wakefield.\r\nHow Montagu came to let Edward get past him is one of the problems\r\nwhose explanation will never be forthcoming. It may have been that his\r\nscouts lost sight of the enemy and missed the line of his flank march.\r\nIt may equally well have been that Montagu overvalued the King's army,\r\nwhich was really no larger than his own, and would not fight till he\r\nshould be joined by his colleague Northumberland. Some contemporary\r\nwriters assert that the Marquis, remembering his old favour with the\r\nKing, was loath that his hand should be the one to crush his former\r\nmaster. Others say that it was no scruple of ancient loyalty that moved\r\nMontagu, but that he had actually determined to desert his brother and\r\njoin Edward's party. But his later behaviour renders this most unlikely.\r\n\r\nMontagu's fatal inaction was the salvation of Edward. At Sendal he\r\nreceived the first encouragement which he had met since his landing.\r\nHe was there in the midst of the estates of the duchy of York, and a\r\nconsiderable body of men joined him from among his ancestral retainers.\r\nEncouraged by this accession, he pushed on rapidly southward, and by\r\nmarches of some twenty miles a day reached Doncaster on the 21st and\r\nNottingham on the 23rd. On the way recruits began to flock in, and\r\nat Nottingham a compact body of six hundred men-at-arms, under Sir\r\nJames Harrington and Sir William Parr, swelled the Yorkist ranks. Then\r\nEdward, for the first time since his landing, paused for a moment to\r\ntake stock of the position of his friends and his enemies.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the news of his march had run like wild-fire all over\r\nEngland, and in every quarter men were arming for his aid or his\r\ndestruction. Warwick had hoped at first that Montagu and Northumberland\r\nwould stay the invader, but when he heard that Edward had slipped\r\npast, he saw that he himself must take the field. Accordingly he left\r\nLondon on the 22nd, and rode hastily to Warwick to call out his Midland\r\nretainers. The guard of the city and the person of King Henry was\r\nleft to his brother the Archbishop. Simultaneously Somerset departed\r\nto levy troops in the South-West, and Clarence set forth to raise\r\nGloucestershire and Wiltshire. Oxford had already taken the field, and\r\non the 22nd lay at Lynn with four thousand men, the force that the not\r\nvery numerous Lancastrians of Norfolk, Suffolk, and Cambridge could put\r\nin arms. From thence he directed his march on Newark, hoping to fall on\r\nEdward's flank somewhere near Nottingham.\r\n\r\nAt that very moment the invader had thrown off the mask he had\r\nhitherto worn. Finding himself well received and strongly reinforced,\r\nhe laid aside his pretence of asking only for the duchy of York, and\r\nhad himself proclaimed as King. But his position was perilous still:\r\nWarwick was gathering head in his front; Montagu was following\r\ncautiously in his rear; Oxford was about to assail his flank. The\r\nenemies must be kept apart at all hazards; so Edward, neglecting the\r\nothers for the moment, turned fiercely on Oxford. He marched rapidly on\r\nNewark with some five or six thousand men. This decision and show of\r\nforce frightened the Earl, who, though joined by the Duke of Exeter and\r\nLord Bardolph, felt himself too weak to fight. When the vanguard of the\r\nYorkists appeared, he hastily left Newark and fell back on to Stamford\r\nin much disorder.\r\n\r\nHaving thus cleared his flank, Edward turned back on Nottingham and\r\nthen made for Leicester. Here he was joined by the Yorkists of the East\r\nMidlands in great numbers; of the retainers of Lord Hastings alone no\r\nless than three thousand came to him in one body.\r\n\r\nWarwick, who lay only two short marches from the invader, was straining\r\nevery nerve to get together an army. His missives ran east and west to\r\ncall in all the knights of the Midlands who had ever mounted the Ragged\r\nStaff or the Red Rose. One of these letters was found in 1889, among\r\nother treasures, in the lumber room of Belvoir Castle. It was addressed\r\nto Henry Vernon, a great Derbyshire landholder. The first part, written\r\nin a secretary's hand, runs as follows:\r\n\r\n Right Trusty and Wellbeloved--I grete you well, and desire and\r\n heartily pray you that, inasmuch as yonder man Edward, the King our\r\n soverain lord's great enemy, rebel, and traitor, is now arrived in\r\n the north parts of this land, and coming fast on south, accompanied\r\n with Flemings, Easterlings, and Danes, not exceeding the number of\r\n two thousand persons, nor the country as he cometh not falling to\r\n him, ye will therefore, incontinent and forthwith after the sight\r\n hereof, dispose you to make toward me to Coventry with as many people\r\n defensibly arranged as ye can readily make, and that ye be with me in\r\n all haste possible, as my veray singular heart is in you, and as I may\r\n do thing [_sic_] to your weal or worship hereafter. And may God keep\r\n you.--Written at Warwick on March 25th.\r\n\r\nThen in the Earl's own hand was written the post-script, appealing to\r\nVernon's personal friendship: \"Henry, I pray you ffayle me not now, as\r\never I may do for you.\"\r\n\r\nSad to say, this urgent appeal, wellnigh the only autograph of the\r\ngreat Earl that we possess, seems to have failed in its purpose. Vernon\r\npreferred to watch the game, and as late as April 2nd had made no\r\npreparation to take arms for either side.\r\n\r\nOn March 28th Warwick with six thousand men advanced to Coventry, a\r\nstrongly-fortified town facing Edward's line of advance. On the same\r\nday his adversary, whose forces must now have amounted to nearly ten\r\nthousand, marched southward from Leicester. Next morning Warwick and\r\nthe King were in sight of each other, and a battle was expected. But\r\nthe Earl was determined to wait for his reinforcements before fighting.\r\nHe calculated that Montagu must soon arrive from the north, Oxford\r\nfrom the east, Clarence from the south-west. Accordingly he shut\r\nhimself up in Coventry, and refused to risk an engagement. Edward,\r\nwhose movements all through this campaign evince the most consummate\r\ngeneralship, promptly marched past his enemy and seized Warwick, where\r\nhe made his headquarters. He then placed his army across the high road\r\nfrom Coventry to London, cutting off the Earl's direct communication\r\nwith the capital, and waited. Like the Earl he was expecting his\r\nreinforcements.\r\n\r\nThe first force that drew near was Clarence's levy from the south-west.\r\nWith seven thousand men in his ranks the Duke reached Burford on April\r\n2nd. Next day he marched for Banbury. On the 4th Warwick received the\r\nhideous news that his son-in-law had mounted the White Rose and joined\r\nKing Edward. The treason had been long meditated, and was carried out\r\nwith perfect deliberation and great success. A few miles beyond Banbury\r\nClarence's array found itself facing that of the Yorkists. Clarence\r\nbade his men shout for King Edward, and fall into the ranks of the\r\narmy that confronted them. Betrayed by their leader, the men made no\r\nresistance, and allowed themselves to be enrolled in the Yorkist army.\r\n\r\nClarence, for very shame we must suppose, offered to obtain terms for\r\nhis father-in-law. \"He sent to Coventry,\" says a Yorkist chronicler,\r\n\"offering certain good and profitable conditions to the Earl, if he\r\nwould accept them. But the Earl, whether he despaired of any durable\r\ncontinuance of good accord betwixt the King and himself, or else\r\nwilling to maintain the great oaths, pacts, and promises sworn to Queen\r\nMargaret, or else because he thought he should still have the upperhand\r\nof the King, or else led by certain persons with him, as the Earl of\r\nOxford, who bore great malice against the King, would not suffer any\r\nmanner of appointment, were it reasonable or unreasonable.\" He drove\r\nClarence's messengers away, \"crying that he thanked God he was himself\r\nand not that traitor Duke.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough Oxford had joined him with four thousand men, and Montagu was\r\napproaching, Warwick still felt himself not strong enough to accept\r\nbattle when Edward and Clarence drew out their army before the gates of\r\nCoventry on the morning of April 5th. He then saw them fall into column\r\nof march, and retire along the London road. Edward, having now some\r\neighteen thousand men at his back, thought himself strong enough to\r\nstrike at the capital, where his friends had been busily astir in his\r\nbehalf for the last fortnight. Leaving a strong rear-guard behind, with\r\norders to detain Warwick at all hazards, he hurried his main body along\r\nthe Watling Street, and in five days covered the seventy-five miles\r\nwhich separated him from London.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Warwick had been joined by Montagu as well as by Oxford, and\r\nalso received news that Somerset, with seven or eight thousand men\r\nmore, was only fifty miles away. This put him in good spirits, for he\r\ncounted on London holding out for a few days, and on the men of Kent\r\nrallying to his standard when he approached the Thames. He wrote in\r\nhaste to his brother the Archbishop, who was guarding King Henry, that\r\nif he would maintain the city but forty-eight hours, they would crush\r\nthe invading army between them. Then he left Coventry and hurried after\r\nthe King, who for the next five days was always twenty miles in front\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nBut all was confusion in London. The Archbishop was not a man of war,\r\nand no soldier of repute was at his side. The Lancastrian party in\r\nthe city had never been strong, and the Yorkists were now organising\r\nan insurrection. There were more than two thousand of them in the\r\nsanctuaries at Westminster and elsewhere, of whom three hundred were\r\nknights and squires. All were prepared to rise at the first signal.\r\nWhen news came that Edward had reached St. Albans, the Archbishop\r\nmounted King Henry on horseback and rode with him about London,\r\nadjuring the citizens to be true to him and arm in the good cause.\r\nBut the sight of the frail shadow of a king, with bowed back and\r\nlack-lustre eyes, passing before them, was not likely to stir the\r\npeople to enthusiasm. Only six or seven hundred armed men mustered in\r\nSt. Paul's Churchyard beneath the royal banner.[19]\r\n\r\nSuch a force was obviously unequal to defending a disaffected city.\r\nNext day, when the army of Edward appeared before the walls, Urswick\r\nthe Recorder of London, and certain aldermen with him, dismissed the\r\nguard at Aldersgate and let Edward in, no man withstanding them. The\r\nArchbishop of York and King Henry took refuge in the Bishop of London's\r\npalace; they were seized and sent to the Tower. George Neville obtained\r\nhis pardon so easily that many accused him of treason. It seems quite\r\npossible that, when he found at the last moment that he could not\r\nraise the Londoners, he sent secretly to Edward and asked for pardon,\r\npromising to make no resistance.\r\n\r\nThe capture of London rendered King Edward's position comparatively\r\nsecure. He had now the base of operations which he had up to this\r\nmoment lacked, and had established himself in the midst of a\r\npopulation favourable to the Yorkist cause. Next day he received a\r\ngreat accession of strength. Bourchier Earl of Essex, his brother\r\nArchbishop Bourchier, Lord Berners, and many other consistent partisans\r\nof York, joined him with seven thousand men levied in the Eastern\r\nCounties. His army was now so strong that he might face any force which\r\nWarwick could bring up, unless the Earl should wait for the levies of\r\nthe extreme North and West to join him.\r\n\r\nOn Maundy Thursday London had fallen; on Good Friday the King lay in\r\nLondon; on Saturday afternoon he moved out again with his army greatly\r\nstrengthened and refreshed, and marched north to meet the pursuing\r\nenemy. Warwick, much retarded on his way by the rear-guard which\r\nthe King had left to detain him and by the necessity of waiting for\r\nSomerset's force, had reached Dunstable on the Friday, only to learn\r\nin the evening that London was lost and his brother and King Henry\r\ncaptured. He pushed on, however, and swerving from the Watling Street\r\nat St. Albans threw himself eastward, with the intention, we cannot\r\ndoubt, of cutting Edward's communication with the Eastern Midlands,\r\nwhere York was strong, by placing himself across the line of the Ermine\r\nStreet. On Saturday evening his army encamped on a rising ground near\r\nMonken Hadley Church, overlooking the little town of Barnet which lay\r\nbelow him in the hollow. The whole force lay down in order of battle,\r\nranged behind a line of hedges; in front of them was the heathy\r\nplateau, four hundred feet above the sea, which slopes down into the\r\nplain of Middlesex.\r\n\r\nAn hour or two after Warwick's footsore troops had taken post for the\r\nnight, and long after the dusk had fallen, the alarm was raised that\r\nthe Yorkists were at hand. On hearing of the Earl's approach the King\r\nhad marched out of London with every man that he could raise. His\r\nvanguard beat Warwick's scouts out of the town of Barnet, and chased\r\nthem back on to the main position. Having found the enemy, Edward\r\npushed on through Barnet, climbed the slope, and ranged his men in the\r\ndark facing the hedges behind which the Earl's army lay,\r\n\r\n much nearer than he had supposed, for he took not his ground so even\r\n in the front as he should have done, if he might better have seen\r\n them. And there they kept them still without any manner of noise or\r\n language. Both sides had guns and ordinance, but the Earl, meaning\r\n to have greatly annoyed the King, shot guns almost all the night.\r\n But it fortuned that they always overshot the King's host, and hurt\r\n them little or nought, for the King lay much nearer to them than they\r\n deemed. But the King suffered no guns to be shot on his side, or else\r\n right few, which was of great advantage to him, for thereby the Earl\r\n should have found the ground that he lay in, and levelled guns thereat.\r\n\r\nSo, with the cannon booming all night above them, the two hosts lay\r\ndown in their armour to spend that miserable Easter even. Next day it\r\nwas obvious that a decisive battle must occur; for the King, whose\r\ninterest it was to fight at once, before Warwick could draw in his\r\nreinforcements from Kent and from the North and West, had placed\r\nhimself so close to the Earl that there was no possibility of the\r\nLancastrian host withdrawing without being observed. The morrow would\r\nsettle, once for all, if the name of Richard Neville or that of Edward\r\nPlantagenet was to be all-powerful in England.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: The _Arrival of King Edward_ says \"only six or seven\r\nthousand\" in the printed text. This must be a scribe's blunder,\r\nbeing not a small number but a large one; and Waurin, who copies the\r\n_Arrival_ verbatim, has \"600 or 700.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nBARNET\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Easter morning dawned dim and gray; a dense fog had rolled up from\r\nthe valley, and the two hosts could see no more of each other than on\r\nthe previous night. Only the dull sound of unseen multitudes told each\r\nthat the other was still before them in position.\r\n\r\nOf the two armies each, so far as we can judge, must have numbered\r\nsome twenty-five thousand men. It is impossible in the conflict of\r\nevidence to say which was the stronger, but there cannot have been any\r\ngreat difference in force.[20] Each had drawn itself up in the normal\r\norder of a medieval army, with a central main-battle, the van and rear\r\nranged to its right and left, and a small reserve held back behind the\r\ncentre. Both sides, too, had dismounted nearly every man, according to\r\nthe universal practice of the English in the fifteenth century. Even\r\nWarwick himself,--whose wont it had been to lead his first line to the\r\ncharge, and then to mount and place himself at the head of the reserve,\r\nready to deliver the final blow,--on this one occasion sent his horse\r\nto the rear and fought on foot all day. He wished to show his men that\r\nthis was no common battle, but that he was risking life as well as\r\nlands and name and power in their company.\r\n\r\nIn the Earl's army Montagu and Oxford, with their men from the North\r\nand East, held the right wing; Somerset with his West-Country archery\r\nand billmen formed the centre; Warwick himself with his own Midland\r\nretainers had the left wing; with him was his old enemy Exeter,--his\r\nunwilling partner in the famous procession of 1457, his adversary\r\nat sea in the spring of 1460. Here and all down the line the old\r\nLancastrians and the partisans of Warwick were intermixed; the Cresset\r\nof the Hollands stood hard by the Ragged Staff; the Dun Bull of Montagu\r\nand the Radiant Star of the De Veres were side by side. We cannot doubt\r\nthat many a look was cast askance at new friends who had so long been\r\nold foes, and that the suspicion of possible treachery must have been\r\npresent in every breast.\r\n\r\nEdward's army was drawn up in a similar order. Richard of Gloucester\r\ncommanded the right wing; he was but eighteen, but his brother had\r\nalready learnt to trust much to his zeal and energy. The King himself\r\nheaded Clarence's men in the centre; he was determined to keep his\r\nshifty brother at his side, lest he might repent at the eleventh hour\r\nof his treachery to his father-in-law. Hastings led the rear-battle on\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nThe armies were too close to each other to allow of manoeuvring; the\r\nmen rose from the muddy ground on which they had lain all night, and\r\ndressed their line where they stood. But the night had led King Edward\r\nastray; he had drawn up his host so as to overlap the Earl's extreme\r\nleft, while he opposed nothing to his extreme right. Gloucester in the\r\none army and Montagu and Oxford in the other had each the power of\r\noutflanking and turning the wing opposed to them. The first glimpse of\r\nsunlight would have revealed these facts to both armies had the day\r\nbeen fair; but in the dense fog neither party had perceived as yet its\r\nadvantage or its danger. It was not till the lines met that they made\r\nout each other's strength and position.\r\n\r\nBetween four and five o'clock, in the first gray of the dawning, the\r\ntwo hosts felt their way towards each other; each side could at last\r\ndescry the long line of bills and bows opposed to it, stretching\r\nright and left till it was lost in the mist. For a time the archers\r\nand the bombards of the two parties played their part; then the two\r\nlines rolled closer, and met from end to end all along Gladsmore\r\nHeath. The first shock was more favourable to Warwick than to the\r\nKing. At the east end of the line, indeed, the Earl himself was\r\noutflanked by Gloucester, forced to throw back his wing, and compelled\r\nto yield ground towards his centre. But at the other end of the line\r\nthe Yorkists suffered a far worse disaster; Montagu and Oxford not\r\nonly turned Hastings' flank, but rolled up his line, broke it, and\r\nchased it right over the heath, and down toward Barnet town. Many of\r\nthe routed troops fled as far as London ere they stopped, spreading\r\neverywhere the news that the King was slain and the cause of York\r\nundone. But the defeat of Edward's left wing had not all the effect\r\nthat might have been expected. Owing to the fog it was unnoticed by the\r\nvictorious right, and even by the centre, where the King and Clarence\r\nwere now hard at work with Somerset, and gaining rather than losing\r\nground. No panic spread down the line \"for no man was in anything\r\ndiscouraged, because, saving a few that stood nearest to them, no man\r\nwist of the rout: also the other party by the same flight and chase\r\nwere never the greatlier encouraged.\" Moreover, the victorious troops\r\nthrew away their chance; instead of turning to aid his hard-pressed\r\ncomrades, Oxford pursued recklessly, cutting down the flying enemy for\r\na mile, even into the streets of Barnet. Consequently he and his men\r\nlost themselves in the fog; many were scattered; the rest collected\r\nthemselves slowly, and felt their way back towards the field, guiding\r\nthemselves by the din that sounded down from the hill-side. Montagu\r\nappears not to have gone so far in pursuit; he must have retained part\r\nof his wing with him, and would seem to have used it to strengthen his\r\nbrother's hard-pressed troops on the left.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile King Edward himself was gaining ground in the centre; his\r\nown column, as the Yorkist chronicler delights to record, \"beat and\r\nbare down all that stood in his way, and then turned to range, first on\r\nthat hand and then on the other hand, and in length so beat and bare\r\nthem down that nothing might stand in the sight of him and of the\r\nwell-assured fellowship that attended truly upon him.\" Somerset, in\r\nshort, was giving way; in a short time the Lancastrian centre would be\r\nbroken.\r\n\r\nAt this moment, an hour after the fight had begun, Oxford and his\r\nvictorious followers came once more upon the scene. Lost in the fog,\r\nthey appeared, not where they might have been expected, on Edward's\r\nrear, but upon the left rear of their own centre. They must have made a\r\nvast detour in the darkness.\r\n\r\nNow came the fatal moment of the day. Oxford's men, whose banners and\r\narmour bore the Radiant Star of the De Veres, were mistaken by their\r\ncomrades for a flanking column of Yorkists. In the mist their badge had\r\nbeen taken for the Sun with Rays, which was King Edward's cognisance.\r\nWhen they came close to their friends they received a sharp volley of\r\narrows, and were attacked by Warwick's last reserves. This mistake\r\nhad the most cruel results. The old and the new Lancastrians had not\r\nbeen without suspicions of each other. Assailed by his own friends,\r\nOxford thought that some one--like Grey de Ruthyn at Northampton--had\r\nbetrayed the cause. Raising the cry of treason, he and all his men fled\r\nnorthward from the field.[21]\r\n\r\nThe fatal cry ran down the labouring lines of Warwick's army and\r\nwrecked the whole array. The old Lancastrians made up their minds that\r\nWarwick--or at least his brother the Marquis, King Edward's ancient\r\nfavourite--must have followed the example of the perjured Clarence.\r\nMany turned their arms against the Nevilles,[22] and the unfortunate\r\nMontagu was slain by his own allies in the midst of the battle. Many\r\nmore fled without striking another blow; among these was Somerset, who\r\nhad up to this moment fought manfully against King Edward in the centre.\r\n\r\nWarwick's wing still held its ground, but at last the Earl saw that\r\nall was lost. His brother was slain; Exeter had been struck down at\r\nhis side; Somerset and Oxford were in flight. He began to draw back\r\ntoward the line of thickets and hedges which had lain behind his army.\r\nBut there the fate met him that had befallen so many of his enemies,\r\nat St. Albans and Northampton, at Towton and Hexham. His heavy armour\r\nmade rapid flight impossible; and in the edge of Wrotham Wood he was\r\nsurrounded by the pursuing enemy, wounded, beaten down, and slain.\r\n\r\nThe plunderers stripped the fallen; but King Edward's first desire was\r\nto know if the Earl was dead. The field was carefully searched, and the\r\ncorpses of Warwick and Montagu were soon found. Both were carried to\r\nLondon, where they were laid on the pavement of St. Paul's, stripped to\r\nthe breast, and exposed three days to the public gaze, \"to the intent\r\nthat the people should not be abused by feigned tales, else the rumour\r\nshould have been sowed about that the Earl was yet alive.\"\r\n\r\nAfter lying three days on the stones, the bodies were given over to\r\nGeorge Neville the Archbishop, who had them both borne to Bisham, and\r\nburied in the abbey, hard by the tombs of their father Salisbury and\r\ntheir ancestors the Earls of the house of Montacute. All alike were\r\nswept away, together with the roof that covered them, by the Vandalism\r\nof the Edwardian reformers, and not a trace remains of the sepulchre of\r\nthe two unquiet brothers.\r\n\r\nThus ended Richard Neville in the forty-fourth year of his age,\r\nslain by the sword in the sixteenth year since he had first taken it\r\nup at the Battle of St. Albans. Fortune, who had so often been his\r\nfriend, had at last deserted him; for no reasonable prevision could\r\nhave foreseen the series of chances which ended in the disaster of\r\nBarnet. Montagu's irresolution and Clarence's treachery were not the\r\nonly things that had worked against him. If the winds had not been\r\nadverse, Queen Margaret, who had been lying on the Norman coast since\r\nthe first week in March, would have been in London long before Edward\r\narrived, and could have secured the city with the three thousand men\r\nunder Wenlock, Langstrother, and John Beaufort whom her fleet carried.\r\nBut for five weeks the wind blew from the north and made the voyage\r\nimpossible; on Good Friday only did it turn and allow the Queen to\r\nsail. It chanced that the first ship, which came to land in Portsmouth\r\nharbour the very morning of Barnet, carried among others the Countess\r\nof Warwick; at the same moment that she was setting her foot on shore\r\nher husband was striking his last blows on Gladsmore Heath. Nor was\r\nit only from France that aid was coming; there were reinforcements\r\ngathering in the North, and the Kentishmen were only waiting for\r\na leader. Within a few days after Warwick's death the Bastard of\r\nFauconbridge had mustered seventeen thousand men at Canterbury in King\r\nHenry's name. If Warwick could have avoided fighting, he might have\r\ndoubled his army in a week, and offered the Yorkists battle under far\r\nmore favourable conditions. The wrecks of the party were strong enough\r\nto face the enemy on almost equal terms at Tewkesbury, even when their\r\nhead was gone. The stroke of military genius which made King Edward\r\ncompel the Earl to fight, by placing his army so close that no retreat\r\nwas possible from the position of Barnet, was the proximate cause of\r\nWarwick's ruin; but in all the rest of the campaign it was fortune\r\nrather than skill which fought against the Earl. His adversary played\r\nhis dangerous game with courage and success; but if only ordinary luck\r\nhad ruled, Edward must have failed; the odds against him were too many.\r\n\r\nBut fortune interposed and Warwick fell. For England's sake perhaps it\r\nwas well that it should be so. If he had succeeded, and Edward had been\r\ndriven once more from the land, we may be sure that the Wars of the\r\nRoses would have dragged on for many another year; the house of York\r\nhad too many heirs and too many followers to allow of its dispossession\r\nwithout a long time of further trouble. The cause of Lancaster, on the\r\nother hand, was bound up in a single life; when Prince Edward fell\r\nin the Bloody Meadow, as he fled from the field of Tewkesbury, the\r\nstruggle was ended perforce, for no one survived to claim his rights.\r\nHenry of Richmond, whom an unexpected chance ultimately placed on the\r\nthrone, was neither in law nor in fact the real heir of the house of\r\nLancaster. On the other hand, Warwick's success would have led, so far\r\nas we can judge, first to a continuance of civil war, then, if he had\r\nultimately been successful in rooting out the Yorkists, to a protracted\r\npolitical struggle between the house of Neville and the old Lancastrian\r\nparty headed by the Beauforts and probably aided by the Queen; for it\r\nis doubtful how far the marriage of Prince Edward and Anne Neville\r\nwould ever have served to reconcile two such enemies as the Earl and\r\nMargaret of Anjou. If Warwick had held his own, and his abilities and\r\nhis popularity combined to make it likely, his victory would have meant\r\nthe domination of a family group--a form of government which no nation\r\nhas endured for long. At the best, the history of the last thirty years\r\nof the fifteenth century in England would have been a tale resembling\r\nthat of the days when the house of Douglas struggled with the crown of\r\nScotland, or the Guises with the rulers of France.\r\n\r\nYet for Warwick as a ruler there would have been much to be said. To a\r\nking of the type of Henry the Sixth the Earl would have made a perfect\r\nminister and vicegerent, if only he could have been placed in the\r\nposition without a preliminary course of bloodshed and civil war. The\r\nmisfortune for England was that his lot was cast not with Henry the\r\nSixth, but with strong-willed, hot-headed, selfish Edward the Fourth.\r\n\r\nThe two prominent features in Warwick's character which made him a\r\nleader of men, were not those which might have been expected in a man\r\nborn and reared in his position. The first was an inordinate love of\r\nthe activity of business; the second was a courtesy and affability\r\nwhich made him the friend of all men save the one class he could not\r\nbrook--the \"made lords,\" the parvenu nobility which Edward the Fourth\r\ndelighted to foster.\r\n\r\nOf these characteristics it is impossible to exaggerate the strength\r\nof the first. Warwick's ambition took the shape of a devouring love\r\nof work of all kinds. Prominent though he was as a soldier, his\r\nactivity in war was only one side of his passionate desire to manage\r\nwell and thoroughly everything that came to his hand. He never could\r\ncease for a moment to be busy; from the first moment when he entered\r\ninto official harness in 1455 down to the day of his death, he seems\r\nhardly to have rested for a moment. The energy of his soul took him\r\ninto every employment--general, admiral, governor, judge, councillor,\r\nambassador, as the exigencies of the moment demanded; he was always\r\nmoving, always busy, and never at leisure. When the details of his life\r\nare studied, the most striking point is to find how seldom he was at\r\nhome, how constantly away at public service. His castles and manors\r\nsaw comparatively little of him. It was not at Warwick or Amesbury,\r\nat Caerphilly or Middleham that he was habitually to be found, but\r\nin London, or Calais, or York, or on the Scotch Border. It was not\r\nthat he neglected his vassals and retainers--the loyalty with which\r\nthey rallied to him on every occasion is sufficient evidence to the\r\ncontrary--but he preferred to be a great minister and official, not\r\nmerely a great baron and feudal chief.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, then, it is most deceptive to call Warwick the Last\r\nof the Barons. Vast though his strength might be as the greatest\r\nlandholder in England, it was as a statesman and administrator that he\r\nleft his mark on the age. He should be thought of as the forerunner\r\nof Wolsey rather than as the successor of Robert of Belesme, or the\r\nBohuns and Bigods. That the world remembers him as a turbulent noble\r\nis a misfortune. Such a view is only drawn from a hasty survey of the\r\nlast three or four years of his life, when under desperate provocation\r\nhe was driven to use for personal ends the vast feudal power that lay\r\nready to his hand. If he had died in 1468, he would be remembered\r\nin history as an able soldier and statesman, who with singular\r\nperseverance and consistency devoted his life to consolidating England\r\nunder the house of York.\r\n\r\nAfter his restless activity, Warwick's most prominent characteristic\r\nwas his geniality. No statesman was ever so consistently popular\r\nwith the mass of the nation, through all the alternations of good\r\nand evil fortune. This popularity the Earl owed to his unswerving\r\ncourtesy and affability; \"he ever had the good voice of the people,\r\nbecause he gave them fair words, showing himself easy and familiar,\"\r\nsays the chronicler. Wherever he was well known he was well liked.\r\nHis own Yorkshire and Midland vassals, who knew him as their feudal\r\nlord, the seamen who had served under him as admiral, the Kentishmen\r\nwho saw so much of him while he was captain of Calais, were all his\r\nunswerving followers down to the day of his death. The Earl's boundless\r\ngenerosity, the open house which he kept for all who had any claim on\r\nhim, the zeal with which he pushed the fortunes of his dependents, will\r\nonly partially explain his popularity. As much must be ascribed to his\r\ngenial personality as to the trouble which he took to court the people.\r\nHis whole career was possible because the majority of the nation not\r\nonly trusted and respected but honestly liked him. This it was which\r\nexplains the \"king-making\" of his later years. Men grew so accustomed\r\nto follow his lead that they would even acquiesce when he transferred\r\nhis allegiance from King Edward to King Henry. It was not because he\r\nwas the greatest landholder of England that he was able to dispose of\r\nthe crown at his good will; but because, after fifteen years of public\r\nlife, he had so commended himself to the majority of the nation that\r\nthey were ready to follow his guidance even when he broke with all his\r\nearlier associations.\r\n\r\nBut Warwick was something more than active, genial, and popular;\r\nnothing less than first-rate abilities would have sufficed to carry him\r\nthrough his career. On the whole, it was as a statesman that he was\r\nmost fitted to shine. His power of managing men was extraordinary; even\r\nKing Louis of France, the hardest and most unemotional of men, seems\r\nto have been amenable to his influence. He was as successful with men\r\nin the mass as with individuals; he could sway a parliament or an army\r\nwith equal ease to his will. How far he surpassed the majority of his\r\ncontemporaries in political prescience is shown by the fact that, in\r\nspite of Yorkist traditions, he saw clearly that England must give up\r\nher ancient claims on France, and continually worked to reconcile the\r\ntwo countries.\r\n\r\nIn war Warwick was a commander of ability; good for all ordinary\r\nemergencies where courage and a cool head would carry him through, but\r\nnot attaining the heights of military genius displayed by his pupil\r\nEdward. His battles were fought in the old English style of Edward\r\nthe Third and Henry the Fifth, by lines of archery flanked by clumps\r\nof billmen and dismounted knights. He is found employing both cannon\r\nand hand-gun men, but made no decisive or novel use of either, except\r\nin the case of his siege-artillery in the campaign of 1464. Nor did\r\nhe employ cavalry to any great extent; his men dismounted to fight\r\nlike their grandfathers at Agincourt, although the power of horsemen\r\nhad again revindicated itself on the Continent. The Earl was a cool\r\nand capable commander; he was not one of the hot-headed feudal chiefs\r\nwho strove to lead every charge. It was his wont to conduct his first\r\nline to the attack and then to retire and take command of the reserve,\r\nwith which he delivered his final attack in person. This caution led\r\nsome contemporary critics, especially Burgundians who contrasted his\r\nconduct with the headlong valour of Charles the Rash, to throw doubts\r\non his personal courage. The sneer was ridiculous. The man who was\r\nfirst into the High Street at St. Albans, who fought through the ten\r\nhours of Towton, and won a name by his victories at sea in an age when\r\nsea-fights were carried on by desperate hand-to-hand attempts to board,\r\nmight afford to laugh at any such criticism. If he fell at Barnet\r\n\"somewhat flying,\" as the Yorkist chronicler declares, he was surely\r\nright in endeavouring to save himself for another field; he knew that\r\none lost battle would not wreck his cause, while his own life was the\r\nsole pledge of the union between the Lancastrian party and the majority\r\nof the nation.\r\n\r\nBrave, courteous, liberal, active, and able, a generous lord to his\r\nfollowers, an untiring servant to the commonweal, Warwick had all\r\nthat was needed to attract the homage of his contemporaries: they\r\ncalled him, as the Kentish ballad-monger sang, \"a very noble knight,\r\nthe flower of manhood.\" But it is only fair to record that he bore\r\nin his character the fatal marks of the two sins which distinguished\r\nthe English nobles of his time. Occasionally he was reckless in\r\nbloodshedding. Once in his life he descended to the use of a long and\r\ndeliberate course of treason and treachery.\r\n\r\nIn the first-named sin Warwick had less to reproach himself with than\r\nmost of his contemporaries. He never authorised a massacre, or broke\r\nopen a sanctuary, or entrapped men by false pretences in order to put\r\nthem to death. In battle, too, he always bid his men to spare the\r\nCommons. Moreover, some of his crimes of bloodshed are easily to be\r\npalliated: Mundeford and the other captains whom he beheaded at Calais\r\nhad broken their oath of loyalty to him; the Bastard of Exeter, whom he\r\nexecuted at York, had been the prime agent in the murder of his father.\r\nThe only wholly unpardonable act of the Earl was his slaying of the\r\nWoodvilles and Herberts in 1469. They had been his bitter enemies, it\r\nis true; but to avenge political rivalries with the axe, without any\r\nlegal form of trial, was unworthy of the high reputation which Warwick\r\nhad up to that moment enjoyed. It increases rather than lessens the sum\r\nof his guilt to say that he did not publicly order their death, but\r\nallowed them to be executed by rebels whom he had roused and might as\r\neasily have quieted.\r\n\r\nBut far worse, in a moral aspect, than the slaying of the Woodvilles\r\nand Herberts, was the course of treachery and deceit that had preceded\r\nit. That the Earl had been wantonly insulted by his thankless master in\r\na way that would have driven even one of milder mood to desperation,\r\nwe have stated elsewhere. An ideally loyal man might have borne the\r\nKing's ingratitude in silent dignity, and foresworn the Court for ever:\r\na hot-headed man might have burst out at once into open rebellion; but\r\nWarwick did neither. When his first gust of wrath had passed, he set\r\nhimself to seek revenge by secret treachery. He returned to the Court,\r\nwas superficially reconciled to his enemies, and bore himself as if\r\nhe had forgotten his wrongs. Yet all the while he was organising an\r\narmed rising to sweep the Woodvilles and Herberts away, and to coerce\r\nthe King into subjection to his will. The plan was as unwise as it\r\nwas unworthy. Although Warwick's treason was for the moment entirely\r\nsuccessful, it made any confidence between himself and his master\r\nimpossible for the future. At the earliest opportunity Edward revenged\r\nhimself on Warwick with the same weapons that had been used against\r\nhimself, and drove the Earl into exile.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in Warwick's subsequent reconciliation with the\r\nLancastrians which need call up our moral indignation. It was the line\r\nof conduct which forced him into that connection that was evil, not the\r\nconnection itself. There is no need to reproach him for changing his\r\nallegiance; no other course was possible to him in the circumstances.\r\nThe King had cast him off, not he the King. When he transferred his\r\nloyalty to the house of Lancaster, he never swerved again. All the\r\noffers which Edward made to him after his return in 1471 were treated\r\nwith contempt. Warwick was not the man to sell himself to the highest\r\nbidder.\r\n\r\nIf then Warwick was once in his life driven into treachery and\r\nbloodthirsty revenge, we must set against his crime his fifteen long\r\nyears of honest and consistent service to the cause he had made his\r\nown, and remember how dire was the provocation which drove him to\r\nbetray it. Counting his evil deeds of 1469-70 at their worst, he will\r\nstill compare not unfavourably with any other of the leading Englishmen\r\nof his time. Even in that demoralised age his sturdy figure stands out\r\nin not unattractive colours. Born in a happier generation, his industry\r\nand perseverance, his courage and courtesy, his liberal hand and\r\ngenerous heart, might have made him not only the idol of his followers,\r\nbut the bulwark of the commonwealth. Cast into the godless times of the\r\nWars of the Roses, he was doomed to spend in the cause of a faction the\r\nabilities that were meant to benefit a whole nation; the selfishness,\r\nthe cruelty, the political immorality of the age, left their mark on\r\nhis character; his long and honourable career was at last stained by\r\ntreason, and his roll of successes terminated by a crushing defeat.\r\nEven after his death his misfortune has not ended. Popular history has\r\ngiven him a scanty record merely as the Kingmaker or the Last of the\r\nBarons, as a selfish intriguer or a turbulent feudal chief; and for\r\nfour hundred and ten years he has lacked even the doubtful honour of a\r\nbiography.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: The Yorkist author of the _Arrival of King Edward_ says\r\nthat his patron had only nine thousand men. But we can account for many\r\nmore. Edward landed with two thousand; at least six hundred joined at\r\nNottingham, at least three thousand at Leicester; Clarence brought\r\nseven thousand, Essex and the other Bourchiers seven thousand more.\r\nThis makes nineteen thousand six hundred, and many more must have\r\njoined in small parties. On the other side Warwick had at Coventry six\r\nthousand men; Oxford met him with four thousand, Montagu with three\r\nthousand, Somerset with seven thousand, and he too must have drawn in\r\nmany small, unrecorded reinforcements. The Yorkists called his army\r\nthirty thousand strong--probably overstating it by a few thousands.\r\nTheir own must have been much the same.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Compare this with an incident at Waterloo. Ziethen's\r\nPrussian corps, coming upon the field to the left rear of the English\r\nline, took the brigade of the Prince of Saxe-Weimar for French owing to\r\na similarity in uniform, attacked them, and slew many ere the mistake\r\nwas discovered.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: There seems no valid reason for accepting Warkworth's\r\ntheory that Montagu was actually deserting to King Edward. But there is\r\nevery sign that the Lancastrians imagined that he was doing so. If he\r\nhad wished to betray his brother, he could have done it much better at\r\nan earlier hour in the battle.]\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n_Printed by_ R. & R.

By Edward A. Freeman, D.C.L., LL.D.\r\n\r\n _TIMES._--\"Gives with great picturesqueness ... the dramatic incidents\r\n of a memorable career far removed from our times and our manner of\r\n thinking.\"\r\n\r\nHENRY II. By Mrs. J.R. Green.\r\n\r\n _TIMES._--\"It is delightfully real and readable, and in spite of\r\n severe compression has the charm of a mediæval romance.\"\r\n\r\nEDWARD I. By Prof. T.F. Tout, M.A. History, The Owens College,\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\n _SPEAKER._--\"A truer or more life-like picture of the king, the\r\n conqueror, the overlord, the duke, has never yet been drawn.\"\r\n\r\nHENRY VII. By Dr. James Gairdner, C.B.\r\n\r\n _ATHENÆUM._--\"The best account of Henry VII. that has yet appeared.\"\r\n\r\nCARDINAL WOLSEY. By Bishop Creighton, D.D.\r\n\r\n _SATURDAY REVIEW._--\"Is exactly what one of a series of short\r\n biographies of English Statesmen ought to be.\"\r\n\r\nELIZABETH. By E.S. Beesly, M.A.\r\n\r\n _MANCHESTER GUARDIAN._--\"It may be recommended as the best and\r\n briefest and most trustworthy of the many books that in this\r\n generation have dealt with the life and deeds of that 'bright\r\n Occidental Star, Queen Elizabeth of happy memory.'\"\r\n\r\nOLIVER CROMWELL. By Frederic Harrison.\r\n\r\n _TIMES._--\"Gives a wonderfully vivid picture of events.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM III. By H.D. Traill.\r\n\r\n _SPECTATOR._--\"Mr. Traill has done his work well in the limited space\r\n at his command. The narrative portion is clear and vivacious, and his\r\n criticisms, although sometimes trenchant, are substantially just.\"\r\n\r\nWALPOLE. By Viscount Morley.\r\n\r\n _ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE._--\"It deserves to be read, not only as the\r\n work of one of the most prominent politicians of the day, but for\r\n its intrinsic merits. It is a clever, thoughtful, and interesting\r\n biography.\"\r\n\r\nPITT. By Lord Rosebery.\r\n\r\n _TIMES._--\"Brilliant and fascinating.... The style is terse,\r\n masculine, nervous, articulate, and clear; the grasp of circumstance\r\n and character is firm, penetrating, luminous, and unprejudiced; the\r\n judgment is broad, generous, humane, and scrupulously candid.... It\r\n is not only a luminous estimate of Pitt's character and policy; it\r\n is also a brilliant gallery of portraits. The portrait of Fox, for\r\n example, is a masterpiece.\"\r\n\r\nPEEL. By J.R. Thursfield, M.A.\r\n\r\n _DAILY NEWS._--\"A model of what such a book should be. We can give it\r\n no higher praise than to say that it is worthy to rank with Mr. John\r\n Morley's _Walpole_ in the same series.\"\r\n\r\nCHATHAM. By Frederic Harrison.\r\n\r\n _ST. JAMES'S GAZETTE._--\"It comes near the model of what such a book\r\n should be.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMACMILLAN AND CO., LTD., LONDON.",
