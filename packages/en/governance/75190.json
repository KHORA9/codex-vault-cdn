The first\r\nuncertain attempts at reconstruction were made at the close of 1862 by\r\nGovernor Shepley with the consent of Lincoln. The President’s policy\r\nwas based upon the belief that there existed in every Southern State\r\na loyal element which might be made to prove the germ of a civil\r\ngovernment owning allegiance to Washington. In the course of that\r\nyear, as the North gained a foothold, he had appointed General Shepley\r\nmilitary governor, whose duty it was to resurrect the loyal element\r\namong the people. Thanks to the vigorous grip over New Orleans of\r\nGenerals Butler and Banks, a considerable body, stronger in numbers\r\nthan social prestige, became firmly wedded to the Union cause. The old\r\nDouglas men sprang into evidence at Butler’s arrival on the scene;\r\nmembers of the Irish Unionists came out strongly; while still others\r\nwere won by the favors distributed with an eye to political gain.\r\nGeneral Shepley ordered an election on December 3 for two Congressmen.\r\nThe successful candidates proved to be B. F. Flanders and Michael\r\nHahn, both of whom were allowed to take their seats in the National\r\nlegislature.\r\n\r\nThere appeared a certain group of men eager to push on the work of\r\nreorganization, either for the plums of office, or, on the part of the\r\nold slave-holders, for the sake of saving a portion of their slaves,\r\nor for the sake of casting off martial law. This group, the Free State\r\nParty, working through the Union Clubs, urged on in 1863 a registration\r\nand convention to frame a new constitution. But it made such slow\r\nprogress that Lincoln developed his famous “Ten Per Cent” plan by\r\nhis proclamation of December 8, 1863, which offered pardon and the\r\nrestoration of property to all who would take a prescribed oath; and\r\ndeclared that the President would recognize as the true government of\r\nany of the seceded States, except Virginia, the organizations set up by\r\nloyal citizens, provided that they constituted one-tenth of the voting\r\npopulation of 1860.[1]\r\n\r\nGeneral Banks, in accordance with this plan, ordered an election\r\nof State officers for February 22, 1864. Hahn, the successful\r\nadministration candidate, was inaugurated on March 4. About ten days\r\nlater he was invested with the “powers exercised before by the military\r\ngovernor.” It is of importance to note that as early as this campaign\r\nthe issue in the radical party was the treatment of the negroes\r\nafter emancipation. Delegates to a constitutional convention were\r\nsubsequently chosen and April 6, ninety-four[2] of the men elected\r\nmet in New Orleans, a fair set of men, but already showing a tendency\r\ntoward that extravagance which was later to be such a blot upon\r\nreconstruction. The convention abolished slavery,[3] but restricted\r\nsuffrage to white males, although it empowered the legislature to\r\nconfer it on “such persons, citizens of the United States, as by\r\nmilitary service, by taxation to support the government, or by\r\nintellectual fitness may be deemed entitled thereto.”[4] A constitution\r\nwas adopted and submitted to the people, but only 8402 votes were cast\r\nin ratification as compared with 11,411[5] in the election of Hahn. The\r\nnew legislature provided for met October 3, elected two Senators, and\r\nadopted the Thirteenth Amendment unanimously. Although this government\r\nwas duly recognized by the President and its ratification of the\r\nAmendment gladly counted to help embody it in the organic law, its\r\nauthority was restricted to a very narrow limit--that actually within\r\nthe Union military lines[6]--and neither branch of Congress admitted\r\nthe members chosen by the new government, while the Presidential vote\r\nof 1865 was rejected.\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1865, fully representative of the State, and\r\njust as fully Democratic, met in extra session to elect two new\r\nSenators in case the two elected previously be rejected as not\r\ntruly representative. With these two Senators, Henry Clay Warmoth\r\npresented himself at Washington as territorial delegate of the radical\r\nRepublicans of the State,[7] his expenses defrayed by his negro\r\nconstituents, who joyfully deposited their half-dollars with their\r\nfirst ballots to pay the expenses of their impecunious delegate.[8]\r\n\r\nSome thirty or more of the members of the convention of 1864 were so\r\nangered at seeing the offices of the State passing to the ex-rebels\r\nthat, with the consent of the governor and a judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt, they began to meet and plan how they could evict them. Before\r\nadjourning, the convention of 1864 had decreed that it might be\r\nreconvoked at the call of the President “for any cause, or in case the\r\nconstitution should not be ratified, for the purpose of taking such\r\nmeasures as may be necessary for the formation of a civil government\r\nfor the State of Louisiana.” This resolution, however, had not been\r\nincorporated in the constitution and had never been passed upon by the\r\npeople.[9]\r\n\r\nThe opponents of negro suffrage denied the right of the convention to\r\nresume its functions and the controversy over the matter became very\r\nfierce. July 30, 1866, the delegates who favored reassembling proceeded\r\nto do so, according to call in New Orleans. A street procession of\r\nnegroes, on their way to the hall, became involved in a serious fight\r\nwith the police and crowds of white spectators. The number killed\r\nand injured amounted to about two hundred and the fact stood out\r\nconspicuously that of this number only about a dozen were policemen\r\nor their white allies. The North and, more especially, Congress was\r\nforced by this episode, together with the rejection of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment[10] and the passage throughout the South of the “Black\r\nCodes,” to the conclusion that the colored people were not safe in the\r\nhands of their former masters.\r\n\r\nHence, the Congressional plan of reconstruction, long brewing,[11] was\r\nforced on the South in the Acts of March 2, 1867, which reëstablished\r\nmilitary rule and provided an entire new organization of government\r\nthrough a convention, elected by negro as well as white vote, and\r\na new constitution, which should be acceptable to Congress[12]; in\r\nthe Supplementary Act of March 23 which placed the initiative in the\r\nhands of the military instead of the State[13]; and the additional\r\nAct of July 19 which substituted for the liberal interpretation\r\nof the earlier acts by civil officials the most rigorous possible\r\nand stripped the Executive of the power of determining removals by\r\nexplicitly conferring certain powers of appointment and removal on the\r\ngeneral of the army.[14] Louisiana and Texas constituted one military\r\ndepartment, placed first under the direction of General Sheridan,\r\nand in August under General Hancock. Under these two commanders\r\nregistration was pushed on so as to record as many blacks and as few\r\nwhites as possible. In September a convention of ninety-eight members\r\nwas elected, consisting by previous agreement of blacks and whites in\r\nequal numbers, all but two, Republicans. The body sat in daily session\r\nfrom November 23 to March 9, ostensibly to frame the new constitution,\r\nbut, because of the lack of a revenue, constituting itself also a\r\nlegislative body. The constitution framed by it was the most severe in\r\nits disfranchising clauses of any in the South.\r\n\r\nIt was quietly ratified April 16 and 17, 1868, and State officers\r\nchosen. H. C. Warmoth was elected governor and the mulatto, O. J.\r\nDunn, lieutenant-governor. The military governor was removed and the\r\ngovernor-elect placed in power at once although his formal inauguration\r\ndid not occur until July 13, 1868. The first legislature of the new\r\nrégime, in which a sweeping radical victory against the unorganized,\r\ndisheartened conservatives had seated a strong Republican majority,\r\nwas in session from June 29 to October 20. The ratification of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment by this body opened the door of re-admission to\r\nthe Union so that by the act of June 25, 1868, Louisiana was once more\r\nempowered to send W. P. Kellogg and J. B. Harris to occupy the seats\r\nin the Senate vacated defiantly seven years before by John Slidell and\r\nJ. P. Benjamin. By July 18, five Representatives had been seated in\r\nthe House, including the first colored person to present himself for\r\nadmission to Congress; and reconstruction would seem to be a matter of\r\nhistory.[15]\r\n\r\nBut the military was not withdrawn, for Louisiana and Arkansas were\r\ncreated into the Department of Louisiana under General Rousseau. Troops\r\nwere so stationed at different points throughout these States that\r\nthey could be called upon to coöperate with the State authorities to\r\npreserve the peace and to sustain the new governments.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential election of the fall of that year once more centered\r\nattention on the State by an undesired and wholly unexpected victory\r\nfor Seymour and Blair, and still more by the disorders and outrages\r\non the negroes.[16] Congress was not allowed to forget that it had a\r\nright to a directing influence in the matter through committees of\r\ninvestigation and decisions on disputed elections to its own body.[17]\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year 1869 carpet-bag government was in full\r\nswing and the picture of the situation in the State is not a bright one.\r\n\r\nThe political condition might well have caused an aristocratic\r\nLouisianian to withdraw himself from the contamination of politics\r\nwith a shudder of despair: a carpet-bagger the recipient of the first\r\nhonor in the gift of the State, and a negro house-painter of the\r\nsecond. Warmoth, young, handsome, and magnetic,[18] was a native of\r\nIllinois, who had entered the army from Missouri. He had had trouble\r\nwith General Grant after the battle of Vicksburg; was charged with\r\ncirculating exaggerated reports of the Union losses while on parole\r\nNorth, was dismissed from the service by Grant, but restored to his\r\ncommand by Lincoln, evidence having shown his dismissal to be unjust.\r\nHe retired from the army in 1865, went to Texas, where he was indicted\r\nfor embezzlement and for appropriating government cotton. But when\r\nthe case was called, no prosecutor appeared and the prosecution was\r\nabandoned. He returned to Louisiana and before reconstruction was sent\r\nas a delegate to Congress as narrated above. He was at this time only\r\ntwenty-six years old, apparently at the height of his powers, social\r\nand political, for even his foes admitted the dignity of his appearance\r\nand the charm of his manners and conversation.\r\n\r\nThe balance of parties in 1868 stood twenty Republicans to sixteen\r\nDemocrats in the Senate, fifty-six to forty-five in the House.[19]\r\nWhite members had been almost entirely supervisors of registration.\r\nWarmoth had selected for this office in the parishes a large number of\r\nmen left in New Orleans as flotsam after the war. They had so impressed\r\nthe negroes that they were returned to the legislature or were\r\nmysteriously counted in by the returning-board.[20] Almost one-half\r\nof the House were negroes, while there were at least seven sable-hued\r\nSenators.[21] The lower State and parish offices were given over\r\nlargely to negroes and scalawags, not always chosen by the governor\r\nwith wisdom.[22]\r\n\r\nThe comment of one of the New Orleans papers is suggestive of the\r\nsentiment of the people toward their legislature. Speaking of the\r\nrevenue bill of 1869 it said:\r\n\r\n  It was the work of the lowest and most corrupt body of men ever\r\n  assembled in the South. It was the work of ignorant negroes[23]\r\n  coöperating with a gang of white adventurers, strangers to our\r\n  interests and our sentiments. It was originated by carpet-baggers and\r\n  was carried through by such arguments as are printed on green-backed\r\n  paper. It was one of the long catalogs of schemes of corruption which\r\n  makes up the whole history of that iniquitous Radical Conclave.[24]\r\n\r\nOr note the _Crescent_: “The troupe which is now playing a sixty-day\r\nengagement at the corner of Royal and Conti streets,[25] which appears\r\ndaily in the farce of ‘How to be a Legislature,’ a day or two since\r\nintroduced among themselves a bill...”[26] And that paper printed later\r\ndaily the following unique “ad,” “Go at once to the St. Louis Rotunda\r\nto see the astounding curiosity &.”\r\n\r\nNo less important to the State than its own political condition was\r\nthe attitude of the National government. The defeat of the Republican\r\nparty in the South in the fall election was like a dash of cold water.\r\nTo an indifference or even a desire to be rid of the whole subject of\r\nreconstruction, which had characterized Congress in the fall of 1868,\r\nsucceeded a resolute purpose to take advantage of every opportunity\r\nto gain an effective and permanent control for the Republican party.\r\nEven the law passed during the session of 1868-9, which provided that\r\nequal eligibility to office should inhere in those who had had their\r\ndisabilities removed by Congress and had taken the oath to support the\r\nconstitution in the act of July 11, 1868, was only a party measure to\r\nwin more firmly the scalawags,[27] as the list of pardons reveals the\r\nfact that most had become Republicans.[28] Grant’s attitude was of\r\nimportance to a degree that Johnson’s was not, for he came into office\r\nearly in 1869, a popular and trusted executive, who would be free, to a\r\nlarge extent, to direct the policy of the government in the South. But,\r\nunfortunately for Louisiana, a brother-in-law, J. F. Casey, was soon\r\nput in charge of the port there and so completely won Grant’s ear that\r\nthe latter approached Louisiana problems with a bias. Friction between\r\nthe State and National authorities was bound to come, for already at\r\nthe opening of 1869 the radicals had lost the respect of the army, and\r\nrecrimination was passing back and forth between the military commander\r\nand the executive of the State.[29]\r\n\r\nSocially, the problem was largely a race question, though the\r\nbitterness of feeling toward her conquerors and contempt of\r\ncarpet-bagger and scalawag enter to complicate the matter. The\r\nintensity of her bitterness toward the North found expression in such\r\nparagraphs as the following:\r\n\r\n  The black and bloody chapter of American subjugation reads so much\r\n  like the scenes of the Netherlands and the Palatinate that it cannot\r\n  claim even the vile merit of distinguished infamy. Let it be blotted\r\n  out and closed. Let the American government publish and execute this\r\n  amnesty in good faith. Let them seek new fields of glory and cease to\r\n  promote men merely because they have distinguished themselves by the\r\n  slaughter of Americans or by laying waste the regions that Americans\r\n  have planted.[30]\r\n\r\nIn moments of calmness appeals to the better sentiment of the North\r\nare heard, coupled with promises that a spirit of conciliation would\r\nbe seconded by the masses of the South, which were prepared to accept\r\nall necessary and reasonable conditions imposed by the result of the\r\nwar.[31]\r\n\r\nTheir particular spleen was vented now vindictively, now humorously,\r\non the carpet-baggers: “Only call off the carpet-baggers and you\r\nare welcome to substitute an army of hand-organists in their stead.\r\nNo sounds can punish our nerves, our patience, and our tympanums so\r\nmuch as the ‘base bawl’ of carpet-baggers.”[32] The host of traders,\r\ncapitalists, and adventurers, who had come down during and just after\r\nthe war to seek a new field for investment in the conquered country,\r\nwere, naturally, regarded more or less as harpies. The number was\r\nformidable, for already by the fall of 1866, between five and ten\r\nthousand Union soldiers had settled in the State.[33] The exasperating\r\nfeature was that they immediately undertook to run the government for\r\nthe natives, securing office through negro votes.[34] Capital, energy,\r\nand talents were desired, but not men to tend to their politics.[35]\r\n\r\nTwo great facts are to be remembered in the negro question in\r\nLouisiana. In the first place the negroes were in a slight majority.\r\nAfter the war the Southerner saw his former slaves avoiding him,\r\ncareless, insolent, acquiring habits of vagrancy, manifesting little\r\nfear in indulging their propensity for theft, believing that under the\r\nguidance of disinterested councillors, they would soon become landed\r\nproprietors without labor, scholars without study, and the social\r\nequals of their former masters. For so many years the fear of a servile\r\ninsurrection had hung over him that he instinctively tried to erect a\r\ndefense against it. The officials of the Freedmen’s Bureau had also\r\nhelped to complicate the situation. For the most part, indiscreet army\r\nofficers, often bent on their own fortunes, the directors managed\r\nthe work in such an inefficient manner that the planters found it an\r\nintolerable nuisance. In the general demoralization of labor, the\r\nSoutherner turned in despair to the legislature for relief and its\r\nimpolitic response was the so-called “Black Codes,” which subjected\r\nthe negro to oppressive restrictions not imposed upon the whites and\r\nsmacked strongly of the slave codes. But it is to be remembered that\r\nthe extremely rigorous code of this State was passed before the dreaded\r\nholidays of 1865-6 when the negroes were confidently expecting Uncle\r\nSam’s gift of “forty acres and a mule.”[36] In the second place, the\r\nGulf States had an element of especially vicious negroes, due to the\r\nfact that before the war criminals for offenses less than murder were\r\ntraditionally sold “South.” There were also more free colored persons\r\nin Louisiana than in all the other Southern States, negroes who were\r\nlikely to have developed some leadership and initiative,[37] but were\r\non the average less intelligent than in most of the former slave\r\nStates.[38]\r\n\r\nEvery effort was made by the radicals to encourage the negro to claim\r\nfull equality with the whites, political and social, until by 1868\r\nthey were demanding not only the franchise, but mixed schools, a share\r\nin public affairs and even social rights. The Southerner, as has been\r\nsaid so many times, did not hate the negro, but he did not believe\r\nthat he could rise in the scale of civilization. He felt that most of\r\nthe negroes had not sufficient intelligence to desire the franchise,\r\nand hence that it was superimposed upon him. Nordhoff declares that\r\n“without whites to organize the colored vote--which means to mass it,\r\nto excite it, to gather the voters at barbacues, to carry them up\r\nwith a hurra to the polls, to make ‘bolting’ terrible, to appeal to\r\nthe fears of the ignorant and the cupidity of the shrewd; without all\r\nthis the negro will not vote.” And it was a well-known fact that the\r\n“organizers”[39] were Federal officers with little else to do. And,\r\nin addition, the campaigns did interfere with the work rendered. The\r\nfollowing passage from Nordhoff, the words of the bitterest Democrat he\r\nmet in the State, shows how direct this was: “And they work just about\r\nas well (as in slavery), except when some accursed politician comes\r\nup from New Orleans with a brass band, and sends word, as was done\r\nlast fall, that General Butler had ordered them all to turn out to a\r\npolitical meeting.”[40]\r\n\r\nNowhere, perhaps, is this sentiment more accurately reflected than in\r\na speech of Senator Ogden’s in the State Assembly: “Do you not know\r\nas well as I that all the disgust, all the anger and bitterness that\r\narose between these different political factions was engendered by the\r\nill voices of certain politicians, who haranguing the ignorant and\r\nsuperstitious, in private and in public, poured into their ears voices\r\nas poisonous as nightshade.”[41]\r\n\r\nNegro suffrage was the burning question, and they were not reconciled,\r\neven after it had become a fact, even when they consented, as they\r\ndid in the fall of 1868, to use the negro vote. But valiantly did the\r\nDemocratic party in that election turn to win them; helped them to form\r\nclubs, promised protection, and offered to give Democratic negroes the\r\npreference in employment, enlisted negro orators; and often had them\r\nspeak from the same platform as white Democrats. Yet all this was but\r\nfor the purpose of securing white ascendency, for it was in this very\r\nyear that the Knights of the White Camelia became perfected into a\r\nFederal organization, pledged to secure white supremacy, and to prevent\r\npolitical power from passing to the negro. The negro franchise might be\r\na fact, but, if organized effort could prevent it, negro office-holding\r\nshould not.[42] The Southerner felt that the last scourge of defeat,\r\nCongressional reconstruction, was founded on falsehood and malice.\r\nHe declared that the reports concerning outrages on negroes had been\r\ndistorted and exaggerated. The only purpose he could see in the zeal\r\nto put the ballot in the hands of men too ignorant to use it without\r\ndirection was to prolong party power.\r\n\r\nThis hostility to the negro vote led to ingenious modes of reasoning\r\nto evade the results of the polls. On the eve of the assembling of the\r\nlegislature of 1869 one of the city papers suggested that a certain\r\nnegro Senator had been rendered ineligible by the adoption of a new\r\nregistry law. As his ballot had been the casting vote which seated\r\nanother negro, the latter held his seat illegally, and the article\r\ncloses with the pertinent query whether laws made by such legislators\r\nwould have any validity.[43]\r\n\r\nAnother factor in the social problem, unique to the South, was not\r\nabsent from Louisiana--the numerous “poor whites” in the northern part\r\nof the State. Living close to the subsistence line on the thin soil\r\nof the pine hills back of the bottom lands, without schools, with\r\nbut few churches, given to rude sports and crude methods of farming,\r\ntheir ignorance and prejudice bred in them after the emancipation of\r\nthe negro a dread of sinking to the social level of the blacks. The\r\ndread, in turn, bred hatred, and it was from this class, instigated\r\nvery probably by the class above them, that the Colfax and Coushatta\r\nmurders[44] took their unfortunate rise.\r\n\r\nAnd still one other element, mischievous in the extreme, must be added\r\nto the social complex--men who pursued no occupation, but preyed on\r\nblack and white alike, as gamblers and tenth-rate politicians, drinking\r\nand swaggering at the bar, always armed with knife and revolver,\r\nshooting negroes now and then for excitement. This class was recruited,\r\nlargely, from the descendants of the old overseer and negro-trader of\r\nante-bellum days. With just enough education to enable them to dazzle\r\nthe negro by a political harangue, they were both disliked and feared\r\nby the decent white people. According to the testimony of a Northern\r\nobserver,[45] the first duty of the Republican leaders in Louisiana\r\nwas “to hang them by the dozen.” And it was just because they were not\r\ncrushed out, except so far as the respectable conservative could combat\r\nthem, that Louisiana had to endure such a drawn-out purgatory before\r\nshe was reconstructed.\r\n\r\nEconomically the State presented no better view. Louisiana had\r\nsuffered particularly from the war, as a part of her soil had been\r\nheld by Federal troops through a great part of the conflict, and the\r\nplantations had been drained, in consequence, of a large part of\r\ntheir labor. Taxable property had been reduced almost two-thirds. The\r\nreturning rebel found his plantation in the worst possible state of\r\nrepair, or his title subject to dispute under the confiscation laws,\r\nwhile much had been seized by treasury agents or dishonest speculators.\r\nHe turned, in the absence of capital, labor, currency, to the one thing\r\nhe knew--the raising of cotton. Even here he had to adjust himself to a\r\ncomplete change of system from fixed, forced labor to payments at set\r\ntimes or planting on shares where he was at the mercy of his planter.\r\nIt cannot be charged, on the whole, that the planter drove unjust\r\nbargains.[46] If the negro suffered, it was at the hands of the poor,\r\nsmall farmers, as ignorant as the negro himself. But a blighted crop in\r\n1866 was followed the next year by an almost complete failure, while\r\nthe Mississippi exacted the penalty of neglected, broken levees by a\r\ndevastating flood. Only in 1868 did the planters obtain an average crop\r\nin the great staples. Grinding necessity, as well as the remorseless\r\npolitical ostracism, drove the better class into indifference to public\r\nconcerns and engrossment in their private affairs. Moreover, ignorant,\r\nunprincipled legislation bred a certain temporary apathy even to their\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\nAlready the finances of the State were in a sad condition. Back taxes\r\nwere in arrears, possibly, as was charged, because the property owners\r\nwere organized in opposition to the existing government,[47] but more\r\nprobably because they were unable to pay. It did not help the situation\r\nthat few filling State positions were tax-payers.[48] By January 19,\r\n1869, only about one-tenth of the amount of the city taxes for the\r\npreceding year had been collected.[49]\r\n\r\nInability to get in the taxes, resulted, naturally, in inability on the\r\npart of the State to meet its obligations. It had been found necessary\r\nin September, 1868, to levy a special one per cent tax to provide\r\nfor the payment of the past due coupons on the bonds of the State,\r\noutstanding warrants, certificates of indebtedness, and convention\r\nwarrants.[50] It was not even able to pay the interest on current debts\r\nand so it was necessary for the legislature early in 1869 to empower\r\nthe governor and treasurer to negotiate a loan to meet such approaching\r\nobligations.[51] Of course, credit had suffered in consequence until by\r\nOctober, 1868, bonds were selling in the market at forty-seven cents on\r\nthe dollar. Certain levee bonds had sunk so low at one time as to be\r\nsold for thirty and even twenty-five cents.[52] A motion offered in the\r\nHouse in the session of 1869 that not less than fifty cents be accepted\r\nis sufficiently illuminating.[53] Many State officials were paid by\r\nwarrants and suffered, except where the Assembly favored the recipient,\r\nas in the case of the executive and its own members, the loss of the\r\ndifference between their face value and the market value.\r\n\r\nLoans were negotiated only with the greatest difficulty and on\r\nexceedingly hard terms. On November 1, 1868, the interest on\r\n$2,000,000 of levee bonds was to fall due without means to meet it.\r\nHence, a new loan of $100,000 was necessary, but it was secured\r\nonly for the short period of ninety days at seven per cent with the\r\nprivilege of the purchase of one hundred of these bonds at sixty\r\ncents by the loaner. At about the same time a commission was sent to\r\nNew York to sell 1300 State bonds. They found a general distrust of\r\nall Southern securities, but especially of those of Louisiana. Its\r\nbonds were not quoted on the stock exchange, and the only offer on\r\nthe street was of a lot at fifty-two cents which found no buyers. The\r\ncommission at last had to accept fifty-one and one quarter cents and,\r\nas a preliminary condition, had to agree that provision should be made\r\nfor the payment of interest on all bonds due in January and February of\r\n1869.[54] Naturally, such loans were secured only at great additional\r\nexpense. The ninety-day loan cost over $3700, while the sale of the\r\n3100 bonds mounted up to $2213, $1000 of which went to pay the cost of\r\nthe trip of the three commissioners.[55] The necessity of paying by\r\nwarrant involved a loss to the State not only directly,[56] but in the\r\ndepression of State credit.\r\n\r\nAn attitude of extravagance and corruption was already becoming\r\napparent in the State administration. The Senate at the close of its\r\nsession in 1868 authorized twelve committees to sit between sessions.\r\nPractically every Senator sat on some committee and each member drew\r\npay for twenty-six days, amounting to $34,620.40 besides $15,000 for\r\nclerks.[57] One committee alone drew between $16,000 and $17,000. Money\r\nwas doubly squandered by one committee, which drew pay for its time and\r\npay for witnesses who were never examined.[58] And one clerk is quoted\r\nas having had time to serve on three committees and drawing warrants\r\nfor four.[59] But this corruption did not come to light until the\r\nAssembly had entered upon its labors of 1869.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Richardson, _Messages and Papers of the Presidents_, VI.,\r\n214.\r\n\r\n[2] Ficklen’s _History of Reconstruction in Louisiana_, states\r\nthat the highest number on the roll at any time was ninety-eight, 68.\r\n\r\n[3] By a vote of 72:13.

A negro preacher defines\r\nthe difference between a carpet-bagger and scalawag as follows: “A\r\ncarpet-bagger came down here from some place and stole enough to\r\nfill his carpet-bag, but the scalawag was a man who knew the woods\r\nand swamps better than the carpet-bagger did, and he stole the\r\ncarpet-bagger’s carpet-bag and ran off with it.” House Misc.

We ought to prove by our demeanor toward those\r\nwho come among us to buy our vacant lands ... that they are welcome and\r\nthat liberal legislation will not be wasted upon us.”\r\n\r\n[32] _Ibid._, Sept. 25, 1869.\r\n\r\n[33] Ficklen gives this number, _History of Reconstruction in\r\nLouisiana_, 176.\r\n\r\n[34] It might be noted that the following officers who figure\r\nconspicuously in the pages of this account were carpet-baggers:\r\nWarmoth, Kellogg, ‘, McMillan, Dewees, Jacques, who will figure in the\r\nfrauds of ’72, Speaker Carr, Campbell, Packard, Dibble; 3-5000 settled\r\nin New Orleans, proportionally less in the parishes.\r\n\r\n[35] See _Times_, May 9, 1875. From the evidence I have met,\r\nI do not believe the feeling against them was so hostile as it became\r\na little later when the South was determined to drive them out. Blaine\r\nmakes a real point when he says, “Northern men recalled in an offensive\r\nmanner the power that had overcome and, as they thought, humiliated\r\nthem,--recalled it before time had made them familiar with the new\r\norder of things.” Blaine, II., 472.\r\n\r\n[36] Nordhoff tells of a negro in St. Mary’s parish who still\r\nin 1875 was retaining a mule halter he had purchased in anticipation of\r\nUncle Sam’s gift, 49.\r\n\r\n[37] It does not seem to me that Vice-President Wilson’s\r\nargument that the experiment of negro self-government would therefore\r\nhave the greatest chance of success (_Times_, Aug. 21, 1876) here is\r\nnecessarily true. It would rather turn upon whether the leadership they\r\nwould assert were vicious or not.\r\n\r\n[38] Due partly to the fact that they came from the large\r\nplantations where the civilizing contact with the white race was\r\nreduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\n[39] A person sent into country parishes some months before\r\nelection to gather up the colored vote; to hold meetings, to instruct\r\nthe local leaders, mostly preachers and teachers, and to organize the\r\nparty.

It\r\nis an insult and outrage to place him over the white people as an\r\noffice-holder.” Granting that slavery was wrong, that did not prove\r\n“that you should be put into office to run the government before your\r\npeople have learned anything about the laws.” Sen.

Nordhoff was a young German immigrant who visited\r\nLouisiana as reporter for the New York _Herald_, and published his\r\nimpressions after an investigation which bears every mark of care and\r\nfairness. One can scarcely accuse him of Southern bias when one reads:\r\n“I have been opposed to slavery ever since I sat on my father’s knee\r\nand was taught by him that slavery was the greatest possible wrong,”\r\n49.\r\n\r\n[47] Such a charge was made by a member in the House.\r\n\r\n[48] Herbert says that ten paid taxes, _Why the Solid South_,\r\n401.\r\n\r\n[49] _Commercial Bulletin_, Jan. 19, 1869.\r\n\r\n[50] Laws of Louisiana, 1868, No. 114.\r\n\r\n[51] _Ibid._, 1869, No. 48.\r\n\r\n[52] House Deb., 1869, 393.\r\n\r\n[53] _Ibid._, 287.\r\n\r\n[54] House Deb., 1869, 43-4. The lack of faith in Southern\r\nbonds was partly due to the unsettled condition, but also to the fact\r\nthat just before the war many Southern States had repudiated their\r\ndebts--an action later to be repeated.\r\n\r\n[55] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[56] One member asserted that $75,000 was thrown away in 1869\r\nby the sale of the warrants on the streets to pay members. _Ibid._,\r\n1870, 15.\r\n\r\n[57] Sen.

The ignorance of the members does\r\nnot appear glaringly in the records of 1869, for the more illiterate\r\ndid not engage in the debate, certainly did not venture upon lengthy\r\naddresses. It is only occasionally that we are appalled by the dense\r\nignorance revealed, as when the colored legislator Burrel broke out\r\ninto a mass of incoherent repetitions in defense of the St. Charles\r\npavement bill.[60]\r\n\r\nThe debate was distinctly partisan. The following outburst, provoked by\r\nthe debate on the militia bill, is sufficiently suggestive:\r\n\r\n  Is it possible that men in broad daylight will say that we should\r\n  not call on the Republican party to give security to the people?\r\n  That we receive this amendment that men should be organized into\r\n  a militia, that will call every disturbance of the peace a “nigger\r\n  insurrection”? Men should prove that they are loyal before they\r\n  can be trusted to go into the militia. This amendment ought to be\r\n  dammed by this House. What, this democracy to be organized into a\r\n  militia to execute Andrew Johnson’s policy! This amendment is full of\r\n  deviltry.[61]\r\n\r\nOn another occasion even the speaker stated as a good reason why a\r\ncertain bill should pass that the board to be affected by it were all\r\ngood Republicans. The bill promptly passed.[62] January 19 a cool\r\nresolution was offered that the persons voted for in the parishes\r\nwhere a fair election had been held, the twenty-six parishes where\r\nthe Democrats had had a majority being calmly ignored, should meet to\r\nvote for President and Vice-President.[63] It is significant, however,\r\nthat sharply drawn as was the party line, the sectional feeling\r\nmanifested was distinctly pro-Southern. When a measure was offered\r\nfor a contribution to a Lincoln Monument, few spoke for it, while\r\nmost felt it frankly impossible that the South could be expected to\r\ncontribute.[64] On the other hand, when the appeal to help bury the\r\nConfederate dead at Fredericksburg came up the following session, even\r\nsuch a hot-headed Unionist as Mr. McMillan spoke reverently in advocacy\r\nof the appropriation.[65]\r\n\r\nBut worse than partisanship was the lack of dignity, even frivolity,\r\nwhich characterized the proceedings. So serious did this become that\r\nthe speaker was frequently forced to call the members to order for\r\ntheir senseless motions and tone of levity.[66] Amendments were\r\nrepeatedly refused by the chair as absurd[67] and even improper. It\r\nwas proposed to add to the oath required by the school bill, “shall\r\ntake whiskey straight without regard to race, color, or previous\r\ncondition.”[68] Some, when ordered read to satisfy the curiosity of the\r\nHouse, proved even indecent.[69] The greatest discourtesy on the part\r\nof one member to another prevailed, while even the president of the\r\nSenate was guilty of recognizing a Senator in the following undignified\r\nway: “Well, just pitch in.” One member cried: “I don’t know what he\r\nis going to talk about. I don’t wish to hear him talk at all, and I\r\ntherefore call for the previous question.”[70] Because one member\r\nread his speech, another called out rudely, “There’s that document\r\nagain.” Or again, “I move the gentleman be allowed to speak all night.\r\nHe occupies the floor more than any other member of this House.”[71]\r\nFreedom of speech both as to time and language and wordy altercations\r\nmade confusion and tumult almost the rule in both houses until such a\r\nremark as the following was possible: “I hope the Sergeant-at-arms will\r\ncall to his assistance a sufficient number of the Metropolitan Police\r\nto keep order and to see whether we cannot have silence, and quiet,\r\nand stillness to hear what is going on,” while the president weakly\r\nadded, “It is really a shame that we cannot have better order.”[72] It\r\nfrequently became necessary for the chair to order the sergeant to seat\r\nobstreperous members and to threaten public censure.[73] In at least\r\none instance the threat was executed.[74] Carter even boldly said of\r\nthe speaker, “I must say that the man who knows the facts of this case,\r\nas he said he did, and is acquainted with the law, and then says that\r\nI am a defaulter, is either a fool or unadulterated liar.” Then less\r\nvehemently, “I will be square and honest and polite to you all, but I\r\nwill be hanged if I am to be bullyragged, and I’ll be switched if I am\r\nto be ridden over by the Speaker or anybody else.”[75]\r\n\r\nReprobate and scoundrel that he proved to be, Speaker Carr[76] had a\r\ncertain power of command, which made it possible for him to control the\r\nHouse. Whenever he called anyone else to the chair, the House broke\r\ninto disorder like a set of unruly schoolboys, leaving him problems\r\nto disentangle on his return. Legislators indulged in pranks such as\r\nwithdrawing a member’s chair while he was speaking in order that his\r\nfall should convulse the House.[77] So notorious was the disorder that\r\none member acknowledged as a well-known fact that gentlemen came from\r\nthe North to see what kind of a House they had. The speaker found it\r\ndifficult to hear the motions, while over and over again the reporter\r\ninserted in the debates “confusion” and a statement to the effect that,\r\nowing to the disorder, he had lost part of the speech. The pages, who\r\nmade as much noise “as a lot of young colts, dodging about the floor,\r\nstanding up, talking and laughing all the time,” according to the\r\nspeaker, added to the disturbance.[78] It would be difficult to read\r\nthe pages that record the proceedings on the 30th of January, 1869,\r\nwithout feeling convinced that the open bar, which it was charged\r\nwas to be found at the capitol, had had its due effect.[79] The last\r\nevening closed fittingly with a mock session, when, as the debates\r\nassure us, “the members had a good time, and the reign of fun prevailed\r\nfor a few minutes.”[80]\r\n\r\nLow as was the tone during the second session of the Assembly, it\r\ndegenerated even lower by the time the Assembly gathered for the third\r\ntime. Debate descended more often to vulgarity[81] and bad grammar and\r\nrhetoric came to the surface more often.[82]\r\n\r\n  Mr. President, I have not expressed on none of these bills termed\r\n  political bills, but, as the gentleman who preceded me from Orleans\r\n  has not entirely represented me, I claim on this floor the privilege.\r\n  In the first place, he says we have elected a demagogue,--or some\r\n  such word.... I say on the other hand, if the way that he holds\r\n  to that he has done what he proposes that he should have done, it\r\n  is because the Democratic members on this floor, when some bills\r\n  were introduced in this House, opposed them bills, and they did not\r\n  become laws.... I do not know what done it, except it was their own\r\n  classes--except it was someone that stood in the ranks in the days of\r\n  old.[83]\r\n\r\nIt was of a legislature which assembled only a year later that Eustis\r\ntold his famous story: “There was a member of Parliament brought me a\r\nletter of introduction, and he asked me if I had any great curiosity to\r\nshow him. I told him I had--such a curiosity as he would never see in\r\nany other civilized country, and I took him to the legislature.”[84]\r\n\r\nIn methods of procedure gross irregularities occurred as a result\r\nof carelessness or deliberate manipulation until the procedure\r\noccasionally became a mere travesty of the forms of government.\r\nWiltz in the House charged that he was never notified to attend a\r\nsingle meeting of the Committee on the City Charter of which he was a\r\nmember.[85] A bill was declared on third reading when the House had\r\nrefused to engross it and had ordered it placed on the calendar. An\r\ninterested member detected the irregularity.[86] A member of the Ways\r\nand Means Committee charged that the revenue bill had been returned\r\nwhen only two members had been present to act on it.[87] One striking\r\noffense was the extraordinary omnibus motion put and carried amid\r\nboisterous laughter late on the evening of February 23: “I move that\r\nthe reading of the bill be dispensed with, the bill be put upon its\r\nfirst reading, the constitutional rule be suspended, the bill be\r\nput upon its second and third readings and final passage, the title\r\nadopted, and that the bill be sent to the Senate for concurrence.”[88]\r\nOne member remonstrated at what he properly termed an “extraordinary\r\nproceeding.” “The Governor has sent in a veto of some bills, and in his\r\nmessage has given very grave reasons for so doing. Now, sir, I want\r\nto see the bills. I don’t know them at all. They were ordered to be\r\nprinted this morning, and now the House desires to take up those bills,\r\ninvolving millions of dollars, without ever giving the members an\r\nopportunity to make themselves acquainted with their provisions.”[89]\r\nAnother member was excused from voting on a bill, which he insisted on\r\nhearing read, only after the following declaration of independence: “I\r\nwill throw myself back upon my reserved rights, and I will not vote,\r\nand the House may take, with all respect, the course they may think\r\nproper.”[90]\r\n\r\nEven the speaker acted on one occasion without knowing what the forms\r\nwere carrying through, for, on the query of a member as to the nature\r\nof the bill under debate, he replied: “Something about taxes. The\r\ngentleman from Orleans moves it be referred to the Committee on Ways\r\nand Means.” It was so referred.[91]\r\n\r\nThe powerful majority did not even manifest the ordinary courtesies of\r\ndebate to the minority, but replied coldly to the very reasonable plea\r\nof the opposition for more time on an important bill: “It seems to be\r\nthe disposition of the committee to work further.”[92] By dispensing\r\nwith the reading of the bill and various other devices to gain time,\r\nbills were often crowded through to adoption at a single sitting.[93]\r\nUnder the operation of the previous question, debate was peremptorily\r\ncut off until one member indignantly cried out: “It is impossible\r\nto sit here and see the funds of the State voted away without an\r\nopportunity to remonstrate against it.”[94]\r\n\r\nCharges of corruption were brought against members of the Assembly not\r\nonly by the press[95] and by the leading citizens of the State, but\r\ncharges were openly brought on the floor of the House. In the debate\r\non the Ship Island Canal bill the remark was dropped that some people\r\nthought there were millions of dollars in that bill, and similar\r\ncharges were made in regard to many other bills.[96] One member even\r\nboldly challenged another: “I want to know how much the gentleman gets\r\nto support this bill.”[97] That unnecessary clerks were employed seems\r\nincontrovertible when the House decided that the auditor might employ\r\nsix clerks to do the work which had always been performed by two or\r\nthree. So notorious became the corruption in many directions that the\r\nHouse felt it obligatory to appoint committees of investigation, even\r\nthough one member contemned the charges as beneath their dignity. The\r\nwording of one resolution offered in the House early in January of\r\n1869 reveals a whole tale: “Resolved, that the President of the Board\r\nof Metropolitan Police be directed to furnish this House with the names\r\nof any members who have been employed as special officers, and under\r\nwhat assumed names they drew their salaries for such services.”[98] The\r\ndebates bring out the fact that two or, possibly, four members were\r\nlaboring under such charge.[99] Likewise, the House became exercised\r\nover a complaint that members serving on different House committees\r\nwere also employed in the custom-house and drawing a salary from each\r\nsource.[100] The Assembly was not slow to put on foot investigations\r\nof other bodies, for corruption seems already to have vitiated most\r\ndepartments of the government and the institutions connected with\r\nit.[101]\r\n\r\nAlthough the finances of the State were calling for the most skillful\r\nhandling, the legislative body acted without even the most ordinary\r\nbusiness prudence. While the time limit for the payment of the city\r\ntaxes and for the collection of the special one per cent tax levied\r\nin September, 1868, had to be extended[102]; while the credit was\r\nso weak that it was found necessary to enforce under penalties the\r\nacceptance of the State warrants for licenses and taxes by the parishes\r\nof Orleans, Jefferson, and Bernard; while the State was in such straits\r\nthat an annual tax became necessary to pay the interest on bonds[103];\r\nand legislators were being put to the embarrassment of being told\r\nthat the Waterworks Company had suspended the water until they should\r\npay their bill,[104] they were voting themselves their pay with a\r\ngenerous hand and squandering State funds in sheer extravagance. They\r\nearly[105] manifested anxiety for their pay, appropriating $250,000 in\r\n1869, $500,000 in 1870, for the mileage and per diem of members and\r\nclerks.[106] Their selfishness took the form in 1869 of instructing\r\nthe warrant clerks to sell the warrants at their market value in order\r\nto pay the members in currency,[107] and in 1870, of giving their\r\nwarrants the preference. Their attitude toward themselves is perhaps\r\nilluminating in explaining their actions. One member had insisted\r\nthat they ought to accept their money in warrants, “in which form the\r\ngovernment pays the community,” when another angrily retorted, “I\r\ndesire to assure him of the very important fact that what we, as the\r\nLegislature, give to the community ... is without money and without\r\nprice. They are so valuable that the price cannot be fixed--there is\r\nno standard.”[108] And another member naïvely wants to know if he does\r\nnot consider the General Assembly the State. Even more telling is the\r\nfollowing exhortation of a member to the House: “I would like to know\r\nif there is a great thing and a good thing, in the name of God, why\r\nnot let the Representatives of the State of Louisiana have a hand in\r\nit.”[109]\r\n\r\nSmall extravagances helped to swell the total cost of this Assembly to\r\n$264,278.06.[110] There were certain items in the general appropriation\r\nbill which looked unnecessarily large. When a mere clerk of a district\r\ncourt received a salary of $6,000, and the rental of a building for\r\na state house cost $13,000 for nine months; when the always elastic\r\nclause for contingent expenses was stretched to $16,000; when printing\r\nand advertising mounted up to $183,000, the people might well begin to\r\nquestion and murmur. A bit of sarcasm was unconsciously incorporated in\r\nthe printing appropriation of 1870 when a motion to substitute $200,000\r\nfor the original $140,000, asking some of these liberal-hearted\r\ngentlemen to open their hearts a little wider and take in every\r\nofficial journal of the State, was adopted.[111] The interest alone on\r\nbonds issued to railroads is probably accurate enough, but had reached\r\nthe terrifying sum of $461,014.14. The only spasm of economy which the\r\nHouse suffered during the entire session of 1869 was really a pick at\r\nthe police, when a few minor officials were struck off or reduced in\r\nsalary.[112]\r\n\r\nThe law which was to provide the income seemed to bear no relation to\r\nthe expenditures. Unwisely wasting their time on a bill to enforce\r\ncollection of taxes already paid to the Confederacy,[113] they rushed\r\nthe revenue bill through with a haste which explains its inadequacy.\r\nUrged by the Committee on Ways and Means to accept its work as\r\ncomplete, even the reading was dispensed with, and the act, which was\r\nreferred to in a later session as a disgrace,[114] adopted by the House\r\nwithout discussion on the evening of March 3.[115] A clause which\r\nprovoked the greatest criticism was one licensing gambling-houses,\r\nwhich appeared in the published bill and came up for a perfect storm\r\nof debate in the session of 1870. The chairman of the committee stated\r\nthat it had not been in the original law, and that he believed it had\r\nbeen surreptitiously introduced after it had been acted upon by the\r\nHouse.[116] Moreover, a bill which made no provision for the interest\r\non the debt, which made an appropriation for an institution which did\r\nnot exist,[117] and which failed to meet the liabilities of the State\r\nby $500,000,[118] indicated business financiering which sooner or later\r\nmust bring the State to bankruptcy.\r\n\r\nAnd just when the finances called for a policy of retrenchment\r\nwas the time when the legislature saw fit to embark on a system\r\nof extensive internal improvements. As has been remarked by many\r\nreconstruction writers, there was a conscious purpose to introduce in\r\nthe South the energy and methods of the North and West in the hope\r\nof similar economic results. It was recognized by the conservatives\r\nthat introduction of new railroads was necessary for economic\r\nrehabilitation. But it must not be forgotten that the sable statesmen\r\nwho were called upon to ponder problems of high finance were ex-slaves\r\nwho had had the experience of a porter’s tips or the extra half-dollars\r\nof a plantation hand. Of the numerous bills of that nature introduced,\r\na considerable number passed, lending State aid with a liberal hand.\r\n\r\nThe enterprises were chiefly of three kinds: canals, railroads, and\r\nthe ever-pressing levees. The Mississippi and Mexican Gulf Ship Canal\r\nCompany profited by this spirit to the extent of $600,000, issued in\r\nthe form of State bonds under a first mortgage, running the generous\r\nperiod of thirty years[119]; the New Orleans and Ship Island Canal\r\nCompany to the extent of $2,000,000 and a large bonus in lands.[120]\r\nThe House did not find it necessary to debate at any great length the\r\nmeasure which legislated away the former sum,[121] but far otherwise\r\nwas the history of the latter act. Introduced into the session of\r\n1868, it had been thoroughly discussed in the Senate and passed by\r\nthat body and came up in the House in 1869 as unfinished business.\r\nIts objectionable features had not been so clear while passing the\r\nSenate, but by the next session it had been thoroughly aired by the\r\npress.[122] It declared the system of the Drainage Commissioners of the\r\nMetropolitan District “erroneous in principle and unsuccessful from\r\nexperience,” and so gave over into the possession of the new Canal\r\nCompany all the funds and assets of the commissioners to the amount\r\nof nearly $2,000,000 and public lands in installments to the extent\r\nof 400,000 acres, on the ground that this canal would accomplish\r\nthe drainage of the entire district. As this fund had been raised by\r\nassessment for the special purpose of drainage, the opposition held\r\nthat it could not thus be diverted. But, nevertheless, this bill was\r\npressed through the House January 29,[123] under heated personal\r\ndebate, extending through several days, and after having suffered much\r\namendment. Although vetoed by the governor, it passed both houses with\r\nthe requisite majority March 2.[124] Smaller sums were donated to minor\r\nenterprises, as $50,000 for the improvement of Loggy Bayou; $20,000 for\r\nimproving Bayou Vermilion[125]; and $80,000 worth of credit loaned to\r\nthe Bœuf and Crocodile Navigation Company.[126]\r\n\r\nAid to railroads was equally liberal. In its zeal the House on February\r\n23, without the reading of the bill, pushed through all its stages the\r\nincorporation of the Louisiana and Arkansas Railroad Company, granted\r\nit exemption from taxation for ten years, a right of way three hundred\r\nfeet in width, and the privilege of all the timber for one mile on\r\neach side of the road through the public lands.[127] But of all the\r\nrailroad bills, by far the most conspicuous was that which extended\r\na helping hand to the New Orleans, Mobile, and Chattanooga Road. It\r\ncame up in the House February 4 and was pressed to a final vote that\r\nvery afternoon and its amendments concurred in by the Senate February\r\n14.[128] The bill provided for the guarantee of the company’s bonds\r\nby the State under the security of a second mortgage to the amount\r\nof $12,500 for each mile within the State west of New Orleans.[129]\r\nParishes along the route of the Vicksburg Railroad were encouraged\r\nto aid that road by the purchase of stock or the issue of bonds, in\r\naddition to the State guarantee of its second mortgage bonds to the\r\nusual amount of $12,500 per mile.[130] Still other roads had found it\r\nworth while to besiege the legislature.\r\n\r\nThe great problem of improvement most urgently pressing was not\r\nadequately met--the construction of a satisfactory series of levees\r\nfor the Mississippi River. A State loan of $4,000,000 had been\r\nprovided for in 1867 for that purpose but the bonds had not been\r\nreadily disposed of.[131] The Board of Levee Commissioners had made\r\ncontracts for a large amount of work but the legislature of 1869\r\nfound no work accomplished--only the bonds of the State pledged for\r\nwork authorized to be done--and so was placed under the necessity\r\nof authorizing the sale of the bonds.[132] The House made a valiant\r\neffort to meet the problem in the passage of a bill to issue bonds to\r\nthe sum of $5,000,000 to provide means for the construction, repairs,\r\nand maintenance of the levees and other works of improvement, but the\r\neffort died there.[133]\r\n\r\nA lack of discrimination characterized the action of the Assembly\r\non this subject. To aid all projects just because they savored of\r\nprosperity would seem to express the attitude of some thoughtless\r\nlegislators. “I am glad that I have one more chance for internal\r\nimprovement,” generously declared one member.[134] Again, a project\r\nfor the northern part of the State was advocated that no charge of\r\npartiality to the Southern part should be brought.[135] Nor is it\r\nfair to lay all the burden of debt arising from these grants of aid\r\nat the door of the radicals. It was rather a response to a universal\r\ndesire for an extension of railroads and improvement of the waterways\r\nof the State, voiced by the moderate conservative press as well as\r\nthe radical. “It is noteworthy as a sign fraught with good promise,”\r\nsays the _Commercial Bulletin_, “that the railroad spirit is alive\r\nin the Northern parishes of this State, and that those whom it\r\ninspires are evidently bent on the early accomplishment of substantial\r\nresults.”[136] In like strain the _Crescent_ concerning the work of the\r\nChattanooga Railroad: “It is certainly to be hoped that we shall soon\r\nhave direct railroad communications with Mobile, and that all efforts\r\nto prevent the consummation of so desirable an object will fail.”[137]\r\nBut the _Picayune_, while on the whole encouraging the measures, was\r\nmore conservative and urged that promises of aid be few, “unless they\r\nare of certain and undoubted practicability and profitableness, and\r\nare secure beyond all peril of loss.”[138] Such measures were supported\r\nby members of both parties, often introduced by Democrats, in every\r\ncase supported by a large majority of Democrats in both houses.[139]\r\nThe leading movers, outside of the legislature, of these bills were men\r\nof both parties; and the lobbyists who advanced the corrupt measures\r\nwere of both faiths.[140] This fact was admitted by the Democratic\r\npress.[141]\r\n\r\nThe legislature of 1869, with which the _Commercial Bulletin_ sourly\r\nassured its readers the people wanted as little as possible to do,\r\nconvened January 4 and sat until March 4. The governor’s annual message\r\nto it, a plea for freedom from prejudice, struck a tone of optimism\r\nwhich subsequent events did not justify: “The issues of the past eight\r\nyears have been settled, we hope, forever. Slavery has been swept away,\r\nand along with it all the train of evils growing out of its wickedness,\r\nand has left us--master and slave, white and black--with the same\r\nrights under the law, the same chance to succeed in life, and with\r\nequally unrestricted aspirations and hopes.” He professed faith in a\r\n“wise, economical, moderate, and firm administration of the nation and\r\nthe State as curing animosities and bringing prosperity to the people.”\r\nThat portion of his message which alluded to the violence of 1868 and\r\nto his measures to allay the excitement was severely challenged by the\r\nDemocratic press.[142]\r\n\r\nThe Assembly during the two months of its existence passed 152 laws,\r\nmany of which were local, many personal relief bills.[143] There was\r\nbeginning to be apparent that tendency to vest autocratic power in\r\nthe hands of the governor, which reached, as we shall see, such a\r\nculmination in the next session. In some instances, it is true, the\r\npropositions could not muster sufficient strength to pass the Assembly,\r\nbut it is significant that such propositions could be offered as Ray’s\r\namendment to the charter bill for New Orleans, which suggested vesting\r\nin the Governor power to appoint the first mayor and council until\r\nthe election in 1872, and the amendment to the volunteer militia\r\nbill, which left to him large discretionary powers.[144] The act which\r\nprohibited the mayor of New Orleans from exercising any police duty or\r\nauthority is equivalent to an enlargement of the governor’s powers,\r\nfor the body with such control, the metropolitan police, was virtually\r\nhis servant through his appointive power.[145] Quite as important was\r\nthe negative action of the Assembly in refusing to force the governor\r\nto order elections in certain cases where for political reasons he was\r\nleaving vacancies.[146]\r\n\r\nOne group of laws attempted to deal with the race and labor questions.\r\nA vagrancy law, which finally overcame the hostile majority in\r\nthe Senate, while not so severe as those of the “Black Code,” did\r\nstill define rather narrowly and imposed heavy penalties.[147] This\r\nstringency arose, at least largely, from the need of labor and devotion\r\nto the crops to which economic conditions forced the planters.[148] A\r\nmeasure to organize a Bureau of Immigration was passed, appropriating\r\n$20,000 to secure a share in the foreign labor which they saw flooding\r\nthe North. Unfortunately, this did not solve the labor problem,\r\nand dissatisfaction with the Bureau,[149] and especially with its\r\ncarpet-bagger chief, J. O. Noyes, was loudly voiced in the session of\r\n1870. Efforts to secure new workers by legislation continued throughout\r\nthe next session. A bill to accord negroes equal civil rights had been\r\nup in the session of 1868 but had not been signed by the governor,\r\nwho was forced to explain to a body of their race assembled en masse,\r\nFebruary 4, 1869, his reasons for not doing so.[150] And Pinchback’s\r\ncivil rights bill, which forbade common carriers and places of public\r\nresort to discriminate on account of race, color, or previous condition\r\nof servitude,[151] came up as unfinished business from the preceding\r\nsession. As was to be expected, feeling ran high and lengthy discussion\r\nresulted, usually of a serious character. Twenty-six Senators were\r\nreported as desirous of speaking on the bill. Pinchback in debate\r\nmade use of the expression “refused a drink of common whiskey in a\r\ncommon grog-shop,” which was seized on by the conservative press as\r\na convenient whip. The cry of the Conservatives was that the colored\r\npeople had too much sense to force themselves where they were not\r\nwanted, and this view was borne out by the negroes themselves. “I\r\nconsider myself just as far above coming into company that does not\r\nwant me, as they are above my coming into an elevation with them.... I\r\ndo not believe that any sensible colored man upon this floor would wish\r\nto be in a private part of a public place without the consent of the\r\nowners of it. It is false; it is wholesale falsehood to say that we\r\nwish to force ourselves upon white people.” But he did insist that they\r\nreceive equal accommodation.[152] The former set down the agitation to\r\na political move to renew the strife.[153]\r\n\r\nWhen the bill had passed both houses, the press took a more aggressive\r\nattitude in an effort to frighten the negroes from any attempt to\r\nclaim their rights. “Will any negro, or gang of negroes, attempt to\r\nexercise the privilege it confers?” belligerently asked the _Commercial\r\nBulletin_. “If they do, it will be at their peril.... He may be able\r\nto obtain a ticket of admission, but no New Orleans audience will ever\r\npermit him to take his seat except in the places allotted for colored\r\npersons.”[154] The _Bee_ declared that if the governor dared to sign\r\nthat bill after vetoing the former, “legal means would not be lacking\r\nto set aside this arbitrary law, this outrage to the law of propriety,\r\nand to individual liberty.”[155]\r\n\r\nThe civil rights bill was backed up by a measure intended to prevent\r\nthe intimidation of negroes by punishing the bribery of witnesses or\r\npreventing a witness by force, threat, or intimidation from testifying\r\nin a criminal proceeding.[156] It is striking that a Ku-Klux bill--a\r\nbill “to prevent people from agoing abroad disguised”--was quickly\r\nreferred and evidently died in committee.[157] Another effort in the\r\nnext session to prevent the carrying of concealed weapons met no better\r\nfate.[158]\r\n\r\nA measure allied to the above legislation, but of vastly greater\r\nimportance because of its National character, was the ratification of\r\nthe Fifteenth Amendment, which was accepted perfunctorily by a vote\r\nof 18 to 3 in the Senate; 59[159] to 9 in the House, 36 Republicans\r\nrefusing to vote.\r\n\r\nParticularly confusing were the various measures which finally evolved\r\ninto the slaughter house bill. Vigorous opposition and much ridicule\r\nmanifested themselves at its first appearance in the House, but all\r\namendments against the monopolistic features were voted down, debate\r\nchoked off abruptly, all attempts at filibustering defeated, and the\r\nbill adopted by a large majority under the operation of the previous\r\nquestion.[160] Scanty indeed is the record of its history in the\r\nSenate. “After a short fight the bill was concurred in as a whole and\r\nthe motion to reconsider tabled by a vote of 23 to 9.”[161] By it the\r\nslaughter of animals, except by the Crescent City Live Stock Landing\r\nand Slaughter House Company was prohibited within the city of New\r\nOrleans or the parishes of Orleans, Jefferson, and St. Bernard after\r\nJune 1, 1869. All animals destined for sale or slaughter must be landed\r\nat the live stock landings and yards of the company, occupying the\r\nlevee from Common to Poydras streets, which naturally exacted a fee for\r\neach steamship and craft landing at its wharves.[162] The excessive\r\nhaste with which the bill was rushed through was pretty generally\r\nbelieved to be due to the fact that legislators had bought stock\r\nwith the privilege of paying at convenience.[163] A perfect hue and\r\ncry against monopoly and violation of private rights went up at the\r\npassage of this bill. Hear the _Bee_: “So the bill has passed, just\r\nas it came from the House, and with provisions so monstrously unjust\r\nthat if it be not arrested by veto, and be subjected to an ordeal by\r\nthe two Houses, in review, which it is believed it cannot survive, it\r\nwill at least become a byword of reproach to all concerned in it.”[164]\r\nOr the _Picayune_: “Nay, monopolies have themselves such elements of\r\ncorruption and are so odious in the land that they can and will be set\r\naside. It may take time and a reformation of the polluted courts of\r\njustice to bring this about, but it will be done when the people awake\r\nto the necessity of driving the money-changers and the false Scribes\r\nand Pharisees from the temple.”[165]\r\n\r\nAs there were about one thousand persons employed in the business in\r\nthe parishes concerned, the effect was broad-spread. The butchers\r\nheld a meeting immediately to consult on the best plan to defeat the\r\nbill[166] and organized an association on July 21. Some hundreds of\r\nsuits were brought in the various district courts on the one side or\r\nthe other, sometimes in combinations, sometimes by individuals. The\r\nground of this opposition was that the act created a monopoly and\r\nwas a violation of the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments and of\r\nthe Louisiana Bill of Rights. The Sixth District Court held the law\r\nunconstitutional, while in the Fifth, in which the new company had\r\ninstituted suit against the association, the verdict was in favor of\r\nthe company. Appeals from these several decisions came before the State\r\nSupreme Court by what is there known as “suspensive appeals,” but the\r\ndecision was not rendered until April 11, 1870, when the rights of\r\nthe new company were upheld. In course of time,[167] the cases came\r\nbefore the Supreme Court of the United States when the decision of the\r\nState court was sustained on the ground of police regulation, “a power\r\nincapable of any very exact definition or limitation.”[168]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[60] “The city of New Orleans will be what we intend to make\r\nit, and we intend to make this city bloom as the rose, and we intend to\r\nenhance and increase this city of New Orleans, and we intend to open\r\nevery by-road, and this very bill is going to make the city bigger,\r\nand we are going to pass this act. We intend not only to legislate for\r\nthe city of New Orleans, but to stamp our record upon the door of this\r\nHouse of Representatives, so it will remain a century of years,” etc.\r\nHouse Debates, 1869, 359-60; also, 415.\r\n\r\n[61] House Debates, 1869, 110.\r\n\r\n[62] _Ibid._, 354.\r\n\r\n[63] New Orleans _Commercial Bulletin_, Jan. 22, 1869.\r\n\r\n[64] House Debates, 1869, 389.\r\n\r\n[65] _Ibid._, 1870, 287.

A law of 1868 provided for the\r\nfilling of all vacancies of State or parish offices by appointment\r\nfor the remainder of the term by the governor with the consent of the\r\nSenate, but by the Governor alone, if the Senate were not in session,\r\nthe appointment to expire the third Monday after the next session of\r\nthe Assembly.[170] Governor Warmoth chose to interpret this as giving\r\nhim the appointment even when the vacancy occurred by the expiration of\r\nthe term of office. In 1868 the legislature had amended the charter of\r\nJefferson City, requiring an election on the first Monday of January,\r\n1869, and every two years thereafter for mayor, treasurer, comptroller,\r\nand aldermen.[171] Section 4 also provided that the governor should\r\nremove the existing aldermen and officers and appoint others until new\r\nincumbents should be elected. Warmoth did not execute this portion\r\nof the law but allowed matters to remain as they were until January,\r\n1869, when an election should have been held. But none was ordered,\r\ninstead of which the governor proceeded the following May to appoint,\r\nas in case of a vacancy. The original mayor, Kreider, refused to\r\nyield office, and so the appointee applied to the district judge for\r\na mandamus to require the delivery of the books, which was granted.\r\nThe new board was installed May 19, by aid of the metropolitan police.\r\nThis action called out some violent demonstrations on the part of\r\nthe citizens but no serious disturbance resulted and it was decided\r\nto leave the matter to the courts. Kreider carried an appeal to the\r\nSupreme Court, which held that the term of the occupants in office had\r\nnot expired, for the failure to hold an election did not vacate the\r\noffice.[172]\r\n\r\nThe case of New Orleans was analogous. The term of office of one-half\r\nof the Council had expired; and a special election was held May 19 to\r\nfill the vacancies. But the governor under his unique interpretation\r\nof the law made appointments to fill them. The old board claimed that\r\nthere were no vacancies, as, according to law, they were to hold their\r\noffices until their successors were duly elected and qualified; namely,\r\nuntil the next regular election. In this form it went to the courts\r\non July 19. A three-cornered comedy of injunctions took place; one,\r\ngranted by Judge Collins, admitted the newly elected members to their\r\nseats; a second, by Judge Leaumont, placed the governor’s appointees\r\nin office and a Democratic howl went up; a third, from Judge Cooley,\r\nrestored the elected members, and a Republican howl went up,[173] but\r\nthis latter injunction was dissolved December 25. Appeal was taken from\r\nthe decision of Judge Leaumont to the Supreme Court by the city of New\r\nOrleans, but was dismissed November 19, because of a technicality.[174]\r\nAt the close of the year, the Governor decided to use the “mailed\r\nfist.” December 28 the sheriff of the Fifth District Court read an\r\norder before the council to exclude certain members and install the\r\nappointees of Warmoth. The approaches to the council-room were crowded.\r\nThe board decided to obey under protest and the governor’s _protégés_\r\nwere seated and proceeded to organize. One old member stayed in his\r\nseat, but as he made himself somewhat troublesome, he was ejected\r\nand another with a commission seated. In the other chamber of the\r\ncity council that same evening one of the appointees appeared within\r\nthe bar. President Wiltz ordered him put out. After adjournment the\r\nsheriff entered the chamber and read the above-mentioned order of Judge\r\nLeaumont.[175] On December 30 the sheriff of the Sixth District Court\r\ncalled the names of the appointees and served a paper upon each from\r\nthe elected members. But the attorney advised obedience to the orders\r\nof the Fifth District Court and with this action the governor remained\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\nThe wrangle between the governor and Wickliffe, the auditor of public\r\naccounts, which extended during most of 1869 and up until March of the\r\nnew year, resulted in a victory for the former. He accused Wickliffe\r\nof extortion and corruption and had him arrested on several specific\r\ncharges. Fourteen indictments for malfeasance to the amount of $1800\r\nwere found by the grand jury. While awaiting the trial, the governor\r\nsuspended Wickliffe and appointed L. T. Delassize, a wealthy negro,\r\nauditor _ad interim_, installing him by the aid of the metropolitan\r\npolice. But Wickliffe, nothing daunted, gave notice through the papers\r\nthat he had opened his office at No. 53 Conti Street, “opposite where\r\nthe Auditor’s office formerly was,” and warned the public not to pay\r\ntaxes or transact any business with the bureau until the auditor could\r\nretake possession of his office.[176] A war of injunctions followed:\r\na writ from the Seventh District Court prohibited Delassize from\r\nperforming his duties on the ground that the governor had no power to\r\nmake the appointment; a counter injunction from the Fifth District\r\nCourt, March 29, restrained Wickliffe from acting. This conflict in\r\njurisdiction went before the Supreme Court,[177] but before a decision\r\ncould be rendered, two of the criminal cases came up for trial, in\r\nboth of which Wickliffe was acquitted, but in the one case the judge\r\nconsidered it necessary to dismiss the jury with a reprimand.[178] The\r\nremainder of the charges were dismissed by the attorney-general on the\r\nground that the auditor could not be tried until after impeachment.\r\nParty feeling ran high in the press concerning the controversy, some\r\nDemocratic papers coming out emphatically for Wickliffe, due possibly\r\nto mere opposition to the governor.[179] The governor withdrew his\r\nopposition and allowed Wickliffe to resume office. In December the\r\nauditor decided to move his archives at night into the building used\r\nas a state house, but the governor on the 30th had his effects removed\r\nfrom Mechanics Institute to the sidewalk.[180] But this fact created\r\nno excitement in the city, as the affair seems still to have been\r\nregarded as a petty, personal squabble.\r\n\r\nIn this shape the matter came before the General Assembly in 1870.\r\nRumors of impeachment had been rife,[181] and even before the\r\ngovernor’s message was sent in, a resolution had been adopted by\r\nthe House for a joint committee to examine into the affairs of the\r\nauditor’s office and the action of the governor in suspending the\r\nauditor.[182] In the special message promised by the governor in his\r\nannual address, he charged that the auditor’s offenses had seriously\r\nembarrassed the government and rendered it difficult to pay the\r\ninterest on the State bonds. He specifically accused him of extortion\r\nagainst individuals and the charitable institutions of the State,\r\nand of fraud against the Commonwealth and collusion with evil-minded\r\npersons.[183] The special committee of the House, to which the message\r\nwas referred, offered on January 31 a resolution of impeachment which\r\nwas debated at some length and adopted on the evening of February 1\r\nwith but five dissenting votes.[184] The seriousness of the question\r\nsobered the Assembly so that the proceedings were marked throughout\r\nthe trial by a dignity and decorum sadly wanting in their other\r\ndiscussions. Articles of impeachment were ordered prepared and the act\r\nsuspending him from office became effective by the prompt concurrence\r\nof the Senate on February 4.[185]\r\n\r\nFebruary 3, Wickliffe brought thirty-four distinct counter charges\r\nagainst Warmoth of violations of the constitution and laws, of\r\nfrauds upon the treasury, charges of corruption in levying blackmail\r\nupon citizens, of bribery of witnesses, and numerous other acts of\r\nmalfeasance. “In short,” the accusation concludes, “his conduct in this\r\nrespect is so notorious that it can be proved that he never signed a\r\nbill of pecuniary benefit to anyone that he did not demand and receive\r\nmoney or other consideration for his signature.”[186] He summed up the\r\nfrauds to the State to the grand total of $800,000 and “untold millions\r\nfrom forgery.” But the only effect this venting of his spleen had upon\r\nWarmoth’s loyal vassals was to cause an investigation to be made which\r\nenabled Warmoth to go before the people exonerated by an official\r\ninquiry.[187]\r\n\r\nThe House preferred twenty-eight articles of impeachment against\r\nWickliffe, most of them for exacting bribes to issue his warrants for\r\nmoney appropriated for printing and charitable institutions, and for\r\nexceeding the appropriations.[188] The trial began February 14, and\r\ncontinued almost daily until the close of the session, when on the\r\nevening of March 3, the Senate found him guilty upon the fourth article\r\nby unanimous vote.[189] A resolution removing him permanently from\r\noffice followed immediately. At the last moment he tried to escape\r\nsentence by resigning,[190] and by fleeing from the State,[191] but\r\nthe Senate proceeded calmly to ignore such cowardice and to vote him\r\nout of office. Whatever may be the fact as to Wickliffe’s dishonesty,\r\nhe was clearly guilty of gross irregularity and carelessness in the\r\nkeeping of his records.[192] And the governor had demonstrated to the\r\nState that his hold on the legislature was sufficiently firm to enable\r\nhim to crush a presumptuous subordinate.\r\n\r\nThe legislation of 1870 marks high tide in Warmoth’s power. The rudder\r\nhe held firmly in his hands for almost two years longer; but against an\r\never-increasing wave of opposition, it became constantly more difficult\r\nto steer in the direction he would. Because of friction within his own\r\nranks, legislation did not again, after 1870, become the mouthpiece for\r\npromulgating his decrees.\r\n\r\nThere were, in reality, two sessions, but the extra session followed so\r\nclosely on the heels of the first, and so much of the work was but the\r\ncompletion of the unfinished business of the first session, that for\r\npurposes of convenience the legislation will be treated as emanating\r\nfrom one body. The Assembly convened for the first session at noon,\r\nJanuary 3. After a slight struggle over the speakership in the House,\r\nMr. Carr of Orleans was elected and the House reported itself ready for\r\nthe governor’s message. Its congratulatory tone sounds a bit forced\r\nwhen he felicitates his people upon “the good feeling that exists among\r\nthe people of both races”; and the cheerfulness with which they are\r\naccepting the new order of things, and the earnestness with which “our\r\npeople are addressing themselves to further protect the great interests\r\ncommitted to their hands.”[193] But it is taken up, for the most part,\r\nwith a businesslike discussion of the various measures which, in\r\nhis estimation, called for action: encouragement of immigration, the\r\nfinances, levees, public improvements, emendation of the school law of\r\n1869, charities, and gambling-houses.[194]\r\n\r\nFor the first time we hear the note of caution in regard to the\r\nfinancial condition. The governor warned the Assembly that it was\r\nnot satisfactory and was such as to embarrass his administration. He\r\nadmitted that the credit of the State had not always been used for\r\npracticable purposes, but insisted that under proper checks it might be\r\nsafely used to a still greater extent.[195] The usual expedients were\r\nagain resorted to: loans were negotiated to meet the interest due; and\r\nthe floating debt was provided for by the issue or exchange of fresh\r\nbonds. But the same extravagance and folly which characterized their\r\nactions in 1869 continued undiminished.[196]\r\n\r\nBy the session of 1870 an old feature of parliamentary tactics was\r\nintroduced: the opposition, though unavailing as to the final vote,\r\nhad become thoroughly organized for filibustering purposes and threats\r\nof recourse to its use were held over the heads of the radicals as\r\na whip.[197] Mr. Lowell proposed once to make a bargain with his\r\nparty, to which he was opposed on a particular bill, by exchanging\r\nhis filibustering advantage for a grant of time.[198] By debates on\r\nrules of order, appeals from the chair to the House, demands for the\r\nroll-call on every little insignificant vote, they were able to waste\r\ntime and wear out their opponents until practically no business was\r\ndone at certain sessions.[199]\r\n\r\nFour of the five measures which were destined to become the most\r\nimportant of the session--indeed of the reconstruction period in\r\nLouisiana--and the storm center about which the opposition to\r\nthe governor gathered, were, together with the appropriation and\r\nrevenue bills, introduced into the Senate as early as the third\r\nday, thus gaining for that active body the questionable distinction\r\nof initiative.[200] Nor did that body lose its zeal in pushing\r\nlegislation, for toward the close of the session bills went through\r\nwith a haste amazing even after the facility displayed on occasion in\r\n1869. At a single evening session twenty bills were acted on,[201]\r\nand yet, despite regular night sessions for about two weeks, the\r\nsession approached its close without concluding much important\r\nlegislation,[202] and without making provision for the revenues or\r\nexpenses of the government. And so, in accordance with the general\r\nexpectation,[203] the governor on March 3 notified the two houses of\r\nthe necessity to reassemble March 7 for ten days. In this extra session\r\nthe Assembly took up and passed the tremendous number of ninety-eight\r\nbills, as compared with one hundred and seven in the first session.\r\n\r\nAn effort to tackle the problem of the government of New Orleans had\r\nsuffered indefinite postponement at the end of the session of 1869.\r\nBoth houses introduced bills early in 1870, but it was only late in\r\nthe extra session, after lengthy, heated debate, numerous amendments,\r\nand the creation of committees of conference, that the two houses\r\ncould agree upon a measure which consolidated Jefferson City with New\r\nOrleans, forced through by the country members, it was vehemently\r\ndeclared, against the vigorous opposition of the city members. The\r\nsmaller city did not want to be saddled with the debt and taxes of the\r\nlarger. A representative of Jefferson said: “I say, sir, here in my\r\nplace, that the people--the masses--do not want to be forced to pay an\r\nadditional 2½ per cent tax.... There are not 150 people in Jefferson\r\nwho would vote for consolidation.”[204] An amendment to submit it to\r\npopular vote was undemocratically voted down. The enlarged city was\r\nto be governed by a mayor and seven administrators, presiding over as\r\nmany departments, who were to constitute the city council. Vacancies in\r\nthese offices were to be filled by appointment by the governor prior to\r\nJanuary 1, 1871, and subsequently by popular election.[205]\r\n\r\nNew Orleans was one of the few Southern cities which had had a system\r\nof public schools before the war. Even in 1865 there were 141 schools\r\nfor freedmen and 19,000 pupils, the result of a free system for\r\ntwenty-five years.[206] A school law, providing in great detail for\r\nthe public education of all persons between six and twenty-one years\r\nof age “without distinction of race or color” had been passed in\r\n1869. But it had been a failure,[207] proving in the governor’s words,\r\n“cumbrous and expensive.”[208] The governor, therefore, suggested that\r\nthe plan be simplified, the districts enlarged, and the powers and\r\ndiscretion of the State board increased.[209] Shortly after the opening\r\nof the session a bill was reported in the House and received, despite\r\nattempts to choke it, full, heated discussion and amendment, section by\r\nsection, passing only on February 10.[210] In the Senate it came up for\r\na lengthy debate on the last evening, when it was crowded out by the\r\npressure of business so that it had to go over to March 9 and 10 in the\r\nextra days of grace when, somewhat amended, it passed by a very large\r\nmajority, the dissenting votes coming from the city members.[211] The\r\nHouse concurred in the Senate amendments the next day.\r\n\r\nFor the purposes of this bill the State was divided into six divisions,\r\nof which New Orleans formed one. The State superintendent was\r\nrequired to nominate to the governor, and the governor to the Senate,\r\na superintendent for each division to hold office three years. The\r\ndivision superintendents with the State superintendent as president\r\nconstituted a board, having the general supervision and control of the\r\npublic schools throughout the State, while the division superintendents\r\nwere to have full control in their respective divisions. The system of\r\nNew Orleans was connected with that of the State by the selection of\r\na city board of directors by the State board, thus repealing all laws\r\ngranting control to the municipal authorities of that city. The State\r\nboard was also to appoint a board for every town, city, and parish in\r\nthe State with full corporate powers to sue and be sued. The general\r\nschool tax was fixed at two mills on the dollar in addition to a tax of\r\ntwo mills to be collected in each parish. It continued, however, the\r\nprovision for the admission of all children between the ages of six and\r\ntwenty-one to the schools.[212]\r\n\r\nA special civil court, the Eighth District Court, created at the\r\nspecial session, proved of transcendent importance, when supported by\r\nthe criminal court,--created several sessions earlier. The two had\r\njurisdiction over all public matters, while the power of appointing the\r\njudges was vested in the governor, thus circumventing the constitution.\r\nAll cases of a public character, contests for office, writs of quo\r\nwarranto, injunctions, mandamus had to be submitted to the former\r\ncourt, to which all cases then pending before other district courts\r\nmust immediately be transferred.[213]\r\n\r\nNumerous petitions to the legislature of 1870 showed that the idea of\r\nimprovements had now seized upon a large number of the constituents as\r\nwell as legislators.[214] Not only did members now propose to raise the\r\nState to economic glory through the ordinary avenue of new railroads\r\nand navigable bayous, but in their enthusiasm they were willing to\r\nlegislate parks[215] and factories into existence and to develop the\r\nmineral resources of the State by the same agency. Bayou Bartholomew\r\nwas now to be improved; the New Orleans and Chattanooga Railroad\r\nboosted by State bonds[216]; and a large sum of stock subscribed in the\r\nMississippi Valley Navigation Company.[217]\r\n\r\nA number of amendments to the constitution were offered this\r\nsession,[218] but only four mustered sufficient strength to pass both\r\nhouses. The most noted were the one which removed the governor’s\r\nineligibility for a second term[219] and the amendment to Article\r\n99, which removed the last restriction on the ex-rebels. It had been\r\noffered in the Assembly, both in 1868 and 1869, and the governor had\r\nurged it in his annual message in the latter year.[220] It stands out\r\nin pleasing relief to most of the partisan legislation of that period,\r\ninasmuch as it was introduced, we are told in debate, by one of the\r\nmost bitter opponents of the Democrats,[221] aroused very little\r\ndebate, and passed almost unanimously in both houses at a single\r\nsitting.[222] Several speeches, all in favor, were made by negroes\r\nto give, as one of them innocently said, “a little coloring to the\r\nmatter.”[223]\r\n\r\nA third amendment was intended to secure the safety of the public\r\nfunds,[224] and the fourth was a most important restriction on the\r\npublic debt, namely, that prior to January 1, 1890, it could not be\r\nincreased beyond $25,000,000.[225]\r\n\r\nBut certain bills were of such transcendent importance that they all\r\nbut effaced the consciousness of other legislation, at least in the\r\nmind of the public. These were the four great bills, the election,\r\nregistration, constabulary, and militia bills, which, together with\r\nthe constitutional amendment which removed ineligibility for a second\r\ngubernatorial term, made it possible for Governor Warmoth to determine\r\nthe personnel of all offices practically at will, and, but for the\r\nstumbling-block of the nominating convention, to continue himself\r\nindefinitely at the head of affairs.\r\n\r\nWhatever may have been the distrust of the governor in the State at\r\nlarge--and complaints were not wanting from the first in Democratic\r\ncircles--confidence in their young leader was unshaken in the men who\r\nconstituted this Assembly. Even when opposing individual bills, members\r\nwere careful to express confidence in Warmoth[226] in some such terms\r\nas follows: “Not that I have anything against the governor himself, but\r\nI think it improper to give such extraordinary power to any man, were\r\nhe an apostle.”[227]\r\n\r\nThese measures were introduced together, as has been stated, on the\r\nthird day, and action on them extended during the entire period up\r\nto the very close of the extra session. The greatest effort of the\r\nopposition was expended on the election bill. This was not a new\r\nconception of 1870, for a strenuous effort to press through such a\r\nbill under cover of the excitement of the closing days of the session\r\nof 1869 had failed. The note of alarm was sounded almost as soon as\r\nthis bill was reported to the Senate by the Judiciary Committee.[228]\r\n“Now, sir, here is a bill giving the governor more than imperial\r\npower--behind it is concealed an armed Grecian horse, with which he may\r\nride over the rights of the people....”[229] Debate raged every day\r\nfrom January 18 to 24. The party aspect of the bill was so evident that\r\nit was assailed at once as a device to perpetuate the Republican party\r\nin power.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” declared one member, “the only persons belonging to this\r\nState who desire this enactment are those in office, and who are\r\nafraid that unless such a bill as this is passed, they will not retain\r\nthe positions they now occupy, and this fear, Mr. President, is not\r\nbased on any fraud or violence that might occur at the next election\r\nin which they might become candidates, but in the simple fact that a\r\nrevolution has taken place in public opinion.”[230] Even a Republican\r\nfelt obliged to break from his party because of its objectionable\r\nfeatures.[231]\r\n\r\nFeeling reached a perfect climax of frenzy and sank to depths of\r\ndespondency for which it was difficult to find language sufficiently\r\nvehement.\r\n\r\n“Therefore, I hope you will believe me when I tell you that this is\r\nthe snake in the grass--the form that the devil himself assumed when\r\nhe seduced our mother Eve. I tell you that this is a devil, covered\r\nand concealed perhaps, under perfumed flowers, but nevertheless, the\r\ndevil--his tail and horn comes out, and not only his tail, but his\r\nhorns and hoof. I tell you that this bill is a devil of a bill--the\r\nconcocters are devilish fellows, and the only way we can destroy their\r\nsulphuric power is to give them hell.”[232] Another outburst was\r\nclothed in more funereal garb:\r\n\r\n  I believe really that if ever there has come a day to the State of\r\n  Louisiana when the whole edifice of her political government ought to\r\n  be draped in mourning, that day has come now. I believe if ever there\r\n  has come a day when all the pomp and glory of the past had forsaken\r\n  her--widowed as she is in affection, destitute of all those glorious\r\n  sympathies that used to awaken a nobler people--we have arrived,\r\n  unfortunately for us, at that miserable period.[233]\r\n\r\nIn his excitement one member cried: “By God! I do not vote when they\r\nare passing bills here to take away the lifeblood of the people.”[234]\r\n\r\nThe Republicans rested their defense on the necessity of an election\r\nlaw which would secure to every citizen entitled to vote a free\r\nexercise of his rights.[235] They turned the debate on the Democrats\r\nby declaring that if they could not carry an election without violence\r\nand were unwilling to pass a law to insure a fair election, they did\r\nnot want an honest vote.[236] Radicals who were not satisfied with the\r\nbill declared that the opposition by their refusal to discuss it fairly\r\nand by filibustering had prevented any modification. The attitude\r\nof the mulatto leader, Pinchback, was that it was the lesser of two\r\nevils.[237] It reëmerged from a special committee, to which it had been\r\ncommitted, January 24,[238] and which again submitted a majority and\r\nminority report, for a second period of debate from January 27 to 31,\r\non which latter date, much amended and fought to the bitter end, it was\r\nadopted by a vote of 20 to 12.[239]\r\n\r\nIt came before the House on February 4, where it was argued at length\r\nfrom February 11 to 16, in keen, searching debate. Members did not\r\nscruple to speak plainly: “This bill, as I believe it, and as I know\r\nit, makes the Republican party dominant; it makes the Governor,--not\r\nclearly, but tacitly--all power; it makes the many parishes of this\r\nState but fiefs of the Executive. It adds one more power to those he\r\nis already endowed with.”[240] Note the succinct condemnation of it\r\nas a party measure in the following query: “Why is the whole State\r\noutlawed in consequence of the misbehavior of portions of it? Outlawed,\r\nI say, for it provides for the outlawry of those who refuse to vote\r\na Republican ticket.”[241] Party feeling ran as high as in the other\r\nHouse, and members found threatening documents on their desks, placed\r\nthere, Republicans declared, by the Ku-Klux.[242] Finally, suffering\r\nmuch amendment here too, it was passed February 18 immediately after\r\nprayer, with a burst of party effort: with the reading of only thirteen\r\nsections,[243] the passage of the bill as a whole was moved and\r\ncarried, the reading of more than fifty sections being thus suppressed,\r\nnotwithstanding the protest of the Democrats at the unconstitutional\r\nmanner in which it was passed.[244] February 19 the Senate concurred in\r\nthe House amendments.[245]\r\n\r\nThe other measures seem almost to have turned on the fate of the\r\nelection law, for the opposition evidently exhausted its great effort\r\non that bill. There was little heat over the other measures; little\r\nfilibustering, few long speeches. Such few members as spoke seemed to\r\ndo so to discharge a moral duty.[246] The registration bill passed\r\nthe Senate, February 9[247] without amendment and the House entirely\r\nwithout debate on the last evening of the regular session.\r\n\r\nThe history of the militia bill in the House was truly remarkable.\r\nIt was introduced March 9 from the Senate, where the interest was so\r\nslight that only seven Senators were present to register their vote\r\nagainst the fourteen votes which carried it[248]; the necessity of\r\nconsidering it in Committee of the Whole was dispensed with, and it was\r\nhurried to its third reading. The story of its passage on the evening\r\nof March 14 is told in the following brief passage from the debates:\r\n\r\n“Chief Clerk Vigers read the bill.\r\n\r\n“I move its final passage, and on that call the previous question.\r\n\r\n“The Speaker put the question on the final passage _viva voce_, and it\r\nwas declared carried.”[249]\r\n\r\nThis action caused the greatest confusion, surprise, and protest.\r\n\r\nThe registration bill threw into the control of the governor the power\r\nto declare who should vote, as the election bill allowed him to declare\r\nfor whom the votes were cast. With the consent of the Senate he was to\r\nappoint a State registrar, and one supervisor in each parish--except\r\nOrleans, where the State registrar was to serve--whose duty it should\r\nbe to cause every qualified voter to be registered and make out lists\r\nof the registered voters for the commissioners of election at each\r\npolling-place.[250] The decision of any supervisor was final. Courts\r\nwere prohibited from interfering in any way with him or his assistants.\r\nThe supervisors, in turn, appointed three commissioners of election at\r\neach poll.\r\n\r\nThe election bill vested in the governor power to take all necessary\r\nsteps to secure a fair, free, and peaceable election; and gave him on\r\nelection day paramount charge and control of the peace and order of\r\nthe State, over all peace and police officers, and over all sheriffs\r\nand constables. Parish and district judges were forbidden to issue\r\nwrits of mandamus or injunction or other order to compel a commissioner\r\nof election to do his duty, as the latter was to be responsible only\r\nto the supervisor and he to the governor. On election day citizens at\r\nlarge were expressly forbidden to carry arms except under orders of\r\nthe executive or his appointees. In all parishes except Orleans, the\r\nduty and function of sheriffs were superseded by men appointed by the\r\ngovernor. The governor and his officers were to be able to withhold\r\ncertificates of election to the General Assembly whenever in their\r\ndiscretion they might see fit, in all cases where fraud, violence,\r\nbribery, or other irregularity might be reported. The capstone of\r\nthe structure, as it has been aptly called, was the returning-board,\r\nconsisting of the governor, lieutenant-governor, secretary of State,\r\nand two Senators indicated by name--John Lynch and T. C. Anderson,--in\r\nwhom was vested the entire revisory power. They were empowered to fill\r\nvacancies within their own number by a majority vote.[251]\r\n\r\nIn order fully to comprehend the opportunity for fraud in elections, it\r\nmust also be noted that the State constitution gave the right to vote\r\nin any parish or in any part of a parish after a residence of ten days,\r\nso that a man, armed with his registration papers, could vote at as\r\nmany polls as he could visit in one day.\r\n\r\nThe purport of the third bulwark of Warmothism, the constabulary\r\nlaw, was to vest in the governor special power to keep the peace.\r\nWith the consent of the Senate he might appoint one chief constable\r\nin each parish, whose duty it should be to preserve the peace, quell\r\ndisturbances and riots, and upon warrant of any competent court,\r\nsummarily arrest all persons charged with murder, assaults, robberies,\r\narson, and riots, subject to the power of the governor. The chief\r\nconstable of the parish was to assign to each precinct a deputy\r\nconstable to perform his duties. Offices of all existing constables\r\nwere declared vacant and the governor empowered to bring in a set of\r\nhis loyal followers at once.[252]\r\n\r\nThe militia bill provided the necessary military power to enforce the\r\nexecution of the preceding laws. Under its provisions the governor was\r\nconstituted Commander-in-Chief of all the militia and could organize,\r\narm, equip, and uniform as many of the able-bodied male citizens\r\nbetween the ages of eighteen and forty-five as he deemed necessary and\r\ncall the same into active service. Full lists were to be submitted from\r\neach parish to the governor from which he might assign a sufficient\r\nnumber of persons to make up five regiments. He was to appoint officers\r\nfor terms of two years to carry out details under his direction. And\r\nthe sum of $100,000 was appropriated to carry out the act.[253]\r\n\r\nSeveral minor bills helped to build up this autocratic power of the\r\nexecutive. Against stormy debate and attacks on its constitutionality,\r\na bill was passed which authorized the governor to issue a warrant for\r\nthe arrest of any person committing a crime punishable by death or\r\npenitentiary imprisonment upon failure of the regularly constituted\r\nofficials to seize him, to be tried in a parish or district court.\r\nAlthough the accused was assured of the service of attorney, the\r\nbill violated State feeling by obliterating parish lines, and by\r\nallowing high fees to the sheriff, levied on the parish where\r\nthe offense occurred.[254] Likewise, the bill which rendered the\r\nMetropolitan Police Board no longer responsible to the recognized\r\nlegal tribunals,[255] and which did not require a bond in case suit was\r\nbrought against it, was only freeing his hands the more. Nor should\r\nthe reader fail to notice in this connection, as the last link in the\r\nchain, that the governor could, under the new city charter, absolutely\r\ncontrol the city politics until after the election, a period of seven\r\nmonths of grace for manipulating his wires.\r\n\r\nLegislation so vital and revolutionary as the measures just outlined\r\nand those appropriating State aid, naturally, aroused hostility, not\r\nonly within the legislature, but also outside, where it raged even more\r\nviolently, if possible. The Democratic press was thoroughly alarmed; it\r\nattacked the various bills continually and held the most dire threats\r\nover the heads of the Senators who dared to support them.[256] Fiery\r\nlanguage was intended to stir the people to action.[257] Feeling rose\r\nto its greatest intensity over the four most important bills.[258]\r\nSignificant calls for secret meetings, signed K. W. C. and I. C.\r\nU.,[259] appeared in the papers, and mass meetings began to be held\r\nboth for and against the bills. The Republican party met in mass\r\nmeeting on January 27 in the hall of the Representatives to urge the\r\nAssembly to pass these bills without delay. This action was probably\r\nto forestall and nullify the effect of a vast mass meeting of the\r\nopponents of the legislation, which was arranged to take place, January\r\n31 in Lafayette Square. The call was issued to all citizens “opposed to\r\nthe financial schemes now pending before the legislature, calculated to\r\nincrease the burdens of the people, depreciate the bonds, and ruin the\r\ncredit of the people, and cripple commerce.”[260] The enthusiasm of the\r\ncrowd here almost outstripped that of the leaders. Said one speaker:\r\n“It is designed not to defend, but to plunder the country, and take\r\naway the liberties of the people. What is to be done?”\r\n\r\n“Kill them,” came the prompt response from the crowd.\r\n\r\n“Ah, no, not yet. But put your foot down and say that this thing shall\r\nnot be. There is power in the fixed determination of the people, and if\r\nthe bills are then passed, do as Boston did to the minions of George\r\nIII. What is to be done with a Legislature that does these things?”\r\n\r\n“Lynch them,” was the verdict of his hearers.[261]\r\n\r\nA series of resolutions was passed protesting against the proposed\r\nbills as destructive of the freedom of elections and as creating an\r\nabsolute despot of the executive, and denouncing their advocates as\r\npublic enemies. Men gave the world notice that they intended to use\r\nall the means in their power to prevent the payment of any bonds or\r\nother obligations of the State which were not indispensably necessary\r\nto the proper administration of the government, and threatened openly\r\nto vote for no man who would not refuse to vote any appropriations for\r\nsuch obligations.[262] Committees in every parish sought to obtain the\r\nsignatures of the citizens of the State to the above resolutions, and\r\na delegation of one hundred citizens was chosen to present them to the\r\ngovernor and the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe governor’s reception of the committee was cordial, but his response\r\ncontained some remarkable charges; he laid the blame for the excesses\r\non lobbyists who knew how to manipulate the negroes, and laid the\r\ncorruption at the door of individuals and corporations who represented\r\nthe very best people; nor did he scruple to withhold names.\r\n\r\n“The bill (the five million bond bill) went to the Senate. I walked\r\ninto the Senate chamber and saw nearly every prominent broker of the\r\ncity engaged in lobbying that bill through the Senate, and it was\r\nonly by exposing the fact that one of their emissaries had come into\r\nthis very chamber and laid upon the desk of my secretary an order for\r\n$50,000 that I was able to defeat it. Mr. Conway, the mayor of your\r\ncity, came here and offered me any consideration to induce me to sign\r\nthis bill.”[263]\r\n\r\nThe visit of the delegates to the Senate on February 2 degenerated\r\ninto pure farce. A long and amusing debate as to whether they should\r\nreceive them or not took place before the delegates, as by some\r\nmisunderstanding they had crowded into the chamber before the Senators\r\nhad settled this momentous question. And Pinchback explained in\r\ngreat detail that he had been obliged to admit them at once or they\r\n“would go off with an additional excuse that we would not listen to\r\nthe representatives of the people.”[264] After the reading of the\r\nresolutions the delegates were virtually asked to leave[265] and the\r\nindignation of the Senators found wordy expression.[266] Though the\r\nsuggestion to return the resolutions as “disrespectful and insulting”\r\nwas not adopted, the latter were promptly tabled.\r\n\r\nThe attempt with the House on the same day met with no more success,\r\nthough preliminary arrangement for a ten-minute recess prevented any\r\nsuch undignified parley as had occurred in the other body. But the\r\nHouse took much the same attitude of offense toward the resolutions and\r\nburied them in a special committee.[267]\r\n\r\nNominating conventions for the selection of candidates for State\r\nofficers were held in the month of September by both the Republican and\r\nDemocratic parties. A feature of both conventions was the appearance\r\nof a large number of colored delegates. Inquiries were sent to the\r\nDemocratic State Central Committee as to the admission of colored\r\ndelegates and so the committee in the regular address to the people\r\ntook occasion to voice the party sentiment in the following language:\r\n\r\n“The interests of both white and black men are identical in this\r\nstruggle. Whatever rights and privileges either enjoy under the\r\nconstitution are sacred, and it is the duty of every citizen to see\r\nthat they are maintained. The Democratic party has always upheld and\r\ndefended the constitution of the country and will now, as ever in the\r\npast, protect and defend every citizen in the full and free exercise\r\nof all rights guaranteed by that instrument.”[268] It declared its\r\nplatform to be retrenchment and reform, reduction of the debt and\r\ntaxation, rebuilt levees, restored confidence, and a desire to develop\r\nthe agricultural resources of the State.\r\n\r\nThe election was remarkable for its peaceful character.[269] But later\r\ninvestigation established the fact that there was much fraud both in\r\nconnection with the appointment of registrars and in the count of the\r\nelection ballots. The law required the appointment of registrars six\r\nmonths before election. Yet in August but two had been appointed. It\r\nwas charged that the governor purposely delayed appointment in order\r\nto influence the August convention.[270] He had appointed in at least\r\nsixteen parishes Democratic supervisors of registration on the score\r\nthat it was hard to find competent Republicans willing to undertake\r\nit and that it was good policy.[271] The same investigation concluded\r\nthat “there is no doubt that most scandalous frauds were committed by\r\nand with the connivance of some of these registrars,[272] sometimes in\r\nthe interest of Republicans and sometimes in the interest of Democratic\r\ncandidates.”[273] An old negro, who had been nominated, was astonished\r\nat the result of the count and cried: “Is it possible I have no vote\r\ncome out of the box? ’Fore God, I know I vote for myself.”[274]\r\n\r\nA considerable number of registrars, clerks, and friends of registrars\r\nwere returned elected to the legislature.[275] Carr, who was returned\r\nfrom De Soto Parish without a nomination, was not even a resident\r\nof that parish,[276] nor was his the only case of that kind. It was\r\nconspicuous that fraudulently returned members were friends of the\r\ngovernor,[277] and he was charged with direct complicity in two\r\ncases. Some rioting, notably at Donaldsonville and Baton Rouge, was\r\nreported.[278] This naturally gave rise to many contested elections\r\nwhich hung on to furnish the opponents of the governor their\r\nopportunity in 1872.\r\n\r\nIt was a clear Republican victory. Graham and Dubuclet, the Republican\r\ncandidates for auditor and treasurer, came in with majorities of about\r\ntwenty-five thousand each, and that party secured majorities in both\r\nbranches of the Assembly. The four constitutional amendments were\r\nsubmitted to popular vote and adopted. The amendment to Article 99 was\r\nindorsed unanimously.[279]\r\n\r\nAn interesting fact is to be noted here. In the spring of 1868, while\r\nthe Democracy was wholly unorganized and the negroes aggressive\r\nunder the protection of the military government, the State went\r\nRepublican, but was carried by a reinvigorated Democratic party in\r\nthe Presidential election of November of the same year; but in 1870\r\nit swung back to the party in power.[280] But there are two perfectly\r\nintelligible explanations which do not necessarily invalidate the vote\r\nfor Seymour in 1868: the new election law and the Enforcement Act of\r\nMay 31, 1870,[281] which imposed heavy penalties for infringement upon\r\nthe right to vote.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[169] Under this apparently harmless clause of the\r\nconstitution he controlled even the lowest local offices in the\r\nremotest parts--constable, justice of the peace, etc.\r\n\r\n[170] Session Laws, 1868, No. 27.\r\n\r\n[171] _Ibid._, No. 75.\r\n\r\n[172] 21 Louisiana Ann., 483-485.\r\n\r\n[173] New Orleans _Commercial Bulletin_, July 19, 1869.\r\n\r\n[174] No pecuniary interest was at stake for the city, because\r\nthe positions of aldermen had no salaries attached. 21 La.

They had learned nothing from the deficiency in the\r\nrevenue of the preceding year but proceeded to quibble about levying\r\na tax of four or five mills though Federal investigation would show\r\nthat agricultural property could easily bear a heavier tax.

The element which was\r\nto become so notorious as the “Custom-House” faction had already made\r\nits appearance in Louisiana politics. A resolution introduced into\r\nthe House in the early days of the session recognized the existence\r\nof separate organizations contending for recognition as the Central\r\nRepublican Club, and designated the men of the New Orleans custom-house\r\nas “erring” members.[282] A certain tension seems to have been present\r\nin the attitude of the House toward all questions respecting the\r\ncustom-house. When the House sought information concerning its own\r\nmembers who were in the employ of the custom-house, Collector Casey\r\nrefused it, as he was not a State officer.[283]\r\n\r\nThe cause of the personal opposition to Warmoth is to be traced, no\r\ndoubt, to the movement for the removal of his ineligibility for a\r\nsecond term, which caused alarm to the other Republican aspirants for\r\nthat honor.[284] Organizations were soon covertly started to defeat\r\nthe amendment at the polls, according to Warmoth’s statement.[285]\r\nOpposition, however, first became open at the Republican State\r\nConvention which assembled at New Orleans, August 9, 1870, for\r\nthe nomination of a ticket and the appointment of a State Central\r\nCommittee. It was felt that the governor was taking extraordinary\r\npains to control that convention, especially as he had been elected a\r\ndelegate by a club which the committee did not recognize.[286] Both he\r\nand the lieutenant-governor, who was also present as a delegate, were\r\nnominated to preside, but here the former met his first check: he was\r\ndefeated by his negro subordinate. As the civil rights bill of the\r\npreceding session still lay unsigned in the hands of the governor, a\r\nresolution of censure was urged by the custom-house officials on the\r\nscore that he had sold out his radical principles to the Democrats;\r\nbut after a heated discussion, in which Warmoth defended his action,\r\nthe matter was dropped and his conduct virtually indorsed.[287] The\r\nconvention denounced special legislation and pledged its best endeavors\r\nto check it.\r\n\r\nThe State Central Committee consisted regularly of fifteen members,\r\nten appointed by the convention, five by the chair. As organized,\r\nthe five appointees of the chair were opposed to the re-eligibility\r\namendment and won over a majority of the whole committee. Hence, the\r\ngovernor refused to contribute to the regular campaign funds or to\r\nencourage his friends to do so, but levied forced contributions upon\r\nall his appointees on pain of dismissal,[288] organized an auxiliary\r\ncommittee, and began a canvass of his own, in many instances in favor\r\nof candidates not regularly nominated by the party.[289] He had tickets\r\nprinted in favor of the amendment,[290] and, as we have seen, scored\r\na victory at the polls. To Dunn’s complaint that the Warmoth faction\r\nhad violated custom in organizing an auxiliary committee, he retorted\r\nthat the regular committee was trying to prevent a fair expression of\r\nopinion on the amendment.\r\n\r\nBefore the legislature met on January 2, 1871, the friends of the\r\ngovernor entered, with his knowledge, into a coalition[291] with the\r\nDemocrats of the Senate, whereby they robbed the lieutenant-governor of\r\nhis patronage by taking the appointment of committees into their own\r\nhands,[292] and made Democrats chairmen and majority members of several\r\nof the committees,[293] thus insuring their seats[294] to certain\r\nmembers who had been fraudulently elected.\r\n\r\nBy the same coalition Carr was re-elected speaker on the first day,\r\nreceiving every Democratic vote.[295] The committees of both houses\r\nwere thus so constituted that anti-Warmoth men were powerless to rid\r\nthe legislature of ineligible members. Dissatisfaction with Carr’s\r\nrulings, however, was so loudly expressed that about the middle of the\r\nsession he was compelled by a union of Democrats with the custom-house\r\nfaction to resign, and Colonel Carter of Cameron, old and rather\r\ndeaf,[296] was elected in his place.[297] Opportunity was now afforded\r\nfor a reconstruction of the Committee on Elections, which, although\r\nunable to complete its investigation before the recess, by an adverse\r\nreport on four members at the next session, ultimately helped to\r\ncomplicate an already intricate situation.\r\n\r\nThe choice of a United States Senator on January 10 to succeed J. S.\r\nHarris served still further to antagonize the custom-house faction\r\nagainst Warmoth. James F. Casey, collector of the port, who had, up\r\nto this time, acted in harmony with the administration party, desired\r\nthis honor for himself,[298] but the governor threw his influence in\r\nfavor of General J. R. West, who, supported by the Democrats under fear\r\nof the election of the negro Pinchback,[299] was elected on the first\r\nballot in both houses.[300] Casey was soon found among the governor’s\r\nmost violent enemies.\r\n\r\nIn view of the peaceful election of the preceding autumn and the\r\ngeneral quiet of the State, the hopeful words of the governor’s message\r\ndo not sound as absurd as events destined to occur within little more\r\nthan a year were to prove them:\r\n\r\n  I cannot pass from this subject to other details, in justice, without\r\n  calling your attention to the general and peaceable acquiescence of\r\n  our people in the results of the reconstruction policy of the general\r\n  government. Their acceptance of it as a finality has been much more\r\n  satisfactory in Louisiana than in any other state in the South.[301]\r\n\r\nWhile urging the encouragement of public improvements, he warned\r\nthe Assembly against certain schemes of plunder “which are already\r\norganizing and will continue to be organized and presented to you\r\nfor votes,” and insisted that the commonwealth’s state of bonded\r\nindebtedness must preclude any further appropriations as subsidy.\r\nAdequate penalty for bribery,[302] which had, he acknowledged, become\r\na “crying evil,” amendments to the public land laws, the police jury\r\nsystem, the restoration of the old capitol at Baton Rouge, and a larger\r\nmeasure of home rule for New Orleans are subjects which appear in his\r\nmessage for the first time.[303] Although defending the legislation\r\nof the previous session, he recommended with studied vagueness of\r\nexpression the modification of the election and registration laws:\r\n  The violent rancor of that period (1868) having now given place to\r\n  a more liberal and just acknowledgment of the true relations of all\r\n  our citizens, I commend to your consideration the modification of the\r\n  registration and election laws to an extent, that, while securing\r\n  the inalienable rights of all, will make the usage under them less\r\n  irksome and exacting to the few.[304]\r\n\r\nTogether with his message he returned without his approval ten bills\r\nto the Senate,[305] and three to the House. The veto power was very\r\nfreely used by Governor Warmoth. Up to January 1, 1871, he had vetoed\r\nthirty-nine bills[306] and suffered others to become law without his\r\napproval by lapse of the constitutional time limit, because they were\r\npassed by such a majority as to have made “his veto a useless bit of\r\nfriction.”[307] His courage in boldly vetoing some measures very close\r\nto the hearts of his legislators should not pass unnoted, nor the\r\nstrength of his influence, for only five, up to this time, were able to\r\nmuster the requisite two-thirds majority in the face of his opposition.\r\n\r\nThe legislature took to heart the governor’s statement that the\r\nquestions most urgent were such measures as would most speedily “bring\r\nrailroads, open natural watercourses, and facilitate ocean commerce,”\r\nwithout heeding his warning of the need for rigid economy. The orgy of\r\nvoting away paper money to aid paper railroads and canals went on with\r\neven greater frenzy than before. It was unfortunate that the governor\r\ndid not carry the courage of his convictions further and instead of\r\nvetoing but six bills, do his part to quash the thirteen laws[308]\r\nwhich appropriated over $800,000 in actual subsidies; which granted\r\naway valuable timber along with the right of way to a new railroad; and\r\nwhich granted exemption from taxation to another canal company. The\r\nloose extension of $40,000, which had been appropriated the preceding\r\nsession for the removal of obstructions in Bayou Bartholomew, to “what\r\nmore might be necessary”[309] is indicative of the business care\r\napplied to the State pocket-book. The governor’s signature to the bill\r\nfor the purchase of a site and erection of a State capitol[310] may be\r\nregarded as raising the State indebtedness by one and one-half million\r\ndollars. He suffered an act guaranteeing the second mortgage bonds of\r\nanother railroad to become law without his signature,[311] but the\r\nmeasure which guaranteed the principal and interest of a warehouse\r\ncompany to the amount of over a million dollars was obliged to pass\r\nover his veto.[312] The total amount added to the State debt by this\r\nAssembly amounted to about four million dollars. Nineteen different\r\nappropriation bills were passed, aside from those granting subsidies.\r\n\r\nBut it was apparent by this time that much of this effort to stimulate\r\ndevelopment by State aid was barren of result. Some roads which had\r\nreceived State aid had nothing to show for it, and committees of\r\ninvestigation “to ascertain whether the said company has complied\r\nwith the conditions of the act” incorporating it were beginning to\r\nappear.[313] So strong was the feeling that the governor recommended\r\nto the next legislature that unless work be begun actively within six\r\nmonths, certain railroads should lose their charters.[314]\r\n\r\nThe vexatious levee problem seemed to have found a solution. When the\r\nserious crevasses which threatened New Orleans with inundation appeared\r\nin the spring, the governor assumed control and closed the breaks with\r\nthe aid of State engineers. The Louisiana Levee Company was then formed\r\nand its interests made identical with those of the State. The company\r\ncontracted to construct, maintain, and control levees on both banks of\r\nthe Mississippi and its tributaries according to the requirements of\r\na competent commission of three able engineers; to construct at least\r\nthree million cubic yards each year until the levee was completed to\r\nthe required standard. To get the company started the State subscribed\r\na considerable sum and levied a special tax of two-tenths per cent\r\nfor twenty-one years for a repair fund, and, in the absence of any\r\ntax for the current year, issued bonds to the amount of one million\r\ndollars.[315]\r\n\r\nAlthough a number of additional schools had been put in operation,[316]\r\nthe superimposed Northern school law still proved unsatisfactory for\r\nLouisiana and came up for further amendment. Forty thousand dollars was\r\nfleeced from the people annually for salaries of school administrators\r\nand incidental expenses, outside of the teachers’ salaries and other\r\nexpenses. School directors were often unable to write their names.\r\nA letter from the president of the school board of Carroll Parish,\r\nas printed in the _National Republican_, is so ungrammatical and\r\nmisspelled that it is almost impossible to read it.[317] Cain Sartain,\r\nwho later figured as a Representative, now a school teacher, was\r\nappallingly ignorant.[318] Naturally demands for the abolition of this\r\ncostly and inefficient establishment were incessant. The supplement\r\npassed this session tended to simplify the law, but the chief change\r\nwas provision for the appointment by a State board of subordinate\r\nboards of school directors for the several parishes, towns, and cities,\r\nwho should have charge of all the funds and school records, all to\r\nbe under the direction of the division superintendent. An additional\r\ntax of one to two mills was to be levied on the taxable property of\r\nthe parish. Special individual provision was made for the board in New\r\nOrleans and for the levying of a special tax to the amount requested by\r\nthe board. But a section of the revenue law which prohibited the city\r\nfrom collecting taxes in excess of two per cent[319] would have closed\r\nthe schools, as the limit had already been exceeded, except for the\r\naid rendered by the State superintendent and the city government.[320]\r\nStill the system awakened great dissatisfaction, even the colored\r\npeople grumbling. The governor, by the appointment of Conway, a\r\nRepublican and intimate friend, to the headship of the school-system,\r\nerected it into a political machine.[321]\r\n\r\nAgreeably to the governor’s recommendation, bills to modify both the\r\nelection and registration[322] laws were introduced into the Senate\r\nabout the middle of the session, but were not pressed through, largely,\r\nit was charged, because of the governor’s secret opposition. An effort\r\nto tamper still further with the government of New Orleans,[323] and\r\na generous appropriation for the militia[324] passed both houses but\r\nfailed, apparently, to secure the governor’s signature. Some attention\r\nwas devoted to the labor problem and to the question of creating\r\nparishes. The latter subject, probably for political reasons, had been\r\nsomething of a mania with the legislature, until at this session[325]\r\nthe proposition was urged with much force “to stop the legislature from\r\ncreating new parishes unless authorized by the voters of the parishes\r\nto be divided.”[326]\r\n\r\nThe extravagance and state of utter corruption of the legislative body\r\nin 1871-2 were only the natural result of the conditions started in\r\n1868-9.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the State debt was disputed. The governor held that it\r\nwas, in round numbers, $22,000,000, while the auditor claimed it to\r\nbe $41,000,000, the difference to be accounted for by a contingent\r\ndebt of $18,000,000 dependent on the construction of railroads, the\r\nsecond mortgage bonds of which the State had agreed to indorse.[327]\r\nThe bonded debt was $19,188,300, the annual interest on which\r\namounted to $1,403,820, besides which there was a miscellaneous debt\r\nof $3,187,490.[328] A comparison of the debt with the period just\r\npreceding the Warmoth administration is suggestive, as it had increased\r\nover $8,000,000 since 1868, taking the conservative estimate,[329]\r\ngrowing by deficiencies at the rate of over $1,000,000 a year. The\r\nexpenditures in 1870 had exceeded the income by over $1,000,000\r\nalthough the deficit was more than covered by the balance in the State\r\ntreasury at the beginning of the year. The total amount of bonds or\r\naid granted by the State to various corporations, prior to 1871 and\r\nfor which bonds had not yet been issued, was over twelve millions. The\r\nauditor estimated the probable expenditures of 1872 at something over\r\nthree millions, but as a matter of fact they far exceeded that sum.\r\n\r\nThe total amount of taxable property in the State at the close\r\nof 1871 was $250,594,417.50 from which $4,605,475.02 in taxes\r\nwas collected.[330] With this should be compared the valuation\r\nand taxes in 1870 to show the decrease. The valuation was the\r\nsame--$251,296,017.02,--but the taxes collected were $6,490,028.[331]\r\nThe unpaid taxes amounted in 1871 to nearly five millions, exclusive\r\nof the taxes due for 1870 and of the taxes in a number of parishes\r\nwhere no rolls of assessment had been made.[332] The aggregate tax\r\nin the State was fourteen and one-half mills on the dollar.[333] So\r\ngreat was the burden of this taxation that in some parishes whole\r\nforty-acre tracts of land, as rich as any in the Nile, were sold that\r\nyear by the tax-gatherer for one dollar, and in many instances estates\r\nabsolutely found no bidders. Large owners were willing to give half\r\ntheir acres to immigrant families on the sole condition that they\r\nshould settle on and improve the land given them. A company was being\r\nformed in northern Louisiana to divide 50,000 acres of land in tracts\r\nof fifty acres to a family. Real estate declined within the years\r\n1870-1 not less than twenty-five per cent.[334] What was formerly\r\nconsidered very good security, mortgage paper for instance, had become\r\nof little value, because in a few years at that rate of taxation no one\r\ncould pass the papers, for in case of foreclosure the property bore\r\nwith it the burden of five, six, or seven per cent taxes which would\r\nleave no revenue.[335] The picture of the financial state drawn by a\r\ndistinguished Democrat about this time is worthy of quotation.\r\n\r\n  If we were threatened with the continuance of the power which has\r\n  administered this government, the conflagration of Chicago would\r\n  not be more desolating than the effect of the continuance of this\r\n  legislation would be upon the city of New Orleans; and the reason\r\n  of it is this: when the city of Chicago was burned to the ground\r\n  the people had at least the ground left, and northern and eastern\r\n  capitalists have come there to rebuild it, while with us, capital is\r\n  flying from the state, commerce is decreasing, and everybody who can\r\n  is trying to get away.[336]\r\n\r\nThe cost of collecting the tax was excessive. Ten per cent of the\r\namount was allowed for assessment and collection in all but portions\r\nof New Orleans where five per cent was deducted. The mere cost to the\r\nState of gathering in the taxes in 1871 was close to $500,000 out of a\r\ntotal of $6,500,000.[337] This made the cost of collection over twelve\r\nper cent.[338] The poll-tax in the second district of New Orleans for\r\n10,146 persons amounted to but $1911, and of this sum, after the cost\r\nof assessment and collection was deducted, only $800.85 was left to the\r\ntreasury.[339]\r\n\r\nThe legislative session of 1871 cost $958,956.50, although the\r\nAssembly appropriated only $641,400, the average cost of each Senator\r\namounting to about $5300, of each Representative, $7300, making the\r\naverage cost of a member $113.50 per day.[340] With this statement\r\nshould be compared the cost before the war, when the largest amount\r\never appropriated for an ordinary session was $100,000.[341] The\r\nexplanation of the enormous difference is to be found in the governor’s\r\ncomment[342]:\r\n\r\n  It was squandered in paying extra mileage and per diem of members for\r\n  services never rendered[343]; for an enormous corps of useless clerks\r\n  and pages,[344] for publishing the journals of each house in fifteen\r\n  obscure parish newspapers, some of which never existed, while some\r\n  never did the work[345]; in paying extra committees authorized to\r\n  sit during the vacation and to travel throughout the State and into\r\n  Texas[346]; and in an elegant stationery bill which included ham,\r\n  champagne, etc.[347]\r\n\r\nThe official reporter in the Senate drew the munificent salary of\r\ntwenty dollars per day,[348] while each representative of a newspaper\r\nreceived a generous gratuity.\r\n\r\nThe enormous printing bills were, of course, a result of corruption.\r\nThe public printing had cost the State in three years $1,500,000,[349]\r\na goodly share of which Warmoth was accused of obtaining because\r\nof his fourth interest in the State paper.[350] Under the law the\r\nthree commissioners named a State printer for the journals, laws,\r\nand debates, but they were also authorized to have the printing done\r\nby certain country papers. In addition the House and Senate claimed\r\nthe right to select other country papers to publish these documents\r\nofficially, to be paid from the contingent funds, so that thirty-five\r\nor forty more were so selected. The sum of $180,000 was paid to papers\r\nin New Orleans in 1871, outside of the official organ.[351] Many of the\r\npapers were sustained only by these contracts.[352] It was generally\r\nbelieved that men were sent over the country to edit these papers in\r\norder to build up the interests of the governor, while Carter, on the\r\nother hand, openly admitted that he gave his patronage to papers which\r\nwould support the reform movement.[353]\r\n\r\nThe entire lack of conscience of the men who were administering the\r\ngovernment came to light during the close of this year and early in\r\n1872 with appalling vividness, until one turns away simply sickened by\r\nthe tale of corruption.[354] Neither party nor class lines regulated\r\nintegrity,[355] for reputable men of both sides were among the persons\r\nwho offered bribes. As Carter put it, “There seems to be something in\r\nthe climate here that affects both parties.”[356] Under oath one man\r\ndeclared that it was generally understood all round that any one who\r\nwanted to get a bill through had to pay for it. He thought there was a\r\nregular office opened down on Royal Street for that purpose where there\r\nwas an agent for members. He had seen money paid right on the floor of\r\nthe House. After the passage of the Chattanooga bill he saw a man with\r\nhis hands full of money paying it out to members with little attempt\r\nat concealment.[357] Senators under false names were incorporators of\r\nmany of the companies chartered and got their shares of stock after\r\nthe bills were passed.[358] So wide-spread was the knowledge of their\r\ndishonesty that the story was current that the members had not even\r\ntime to write their promises to vote the passage of such and such a\r\nbill, but had to resort to printed blanks.[359]\r\n\r\nOne of the dishonest measures, not mentioned elsewhere, should not be\r\npassed without brief mention, at least. In 1870[360] the legislature\r\nauthorized the improvement of the old city park, a piece of ground\r\nwhich had been held for the purpose for many years. During the\r\nfollowing year two politicians, Southworth and Bloomer, got a written\r\nagreement from the owners of a large vacant piece of land--the only\r\nlarge tract near the city--to sell it to them at a fixed price, six\r\nhundred thousand dollars. The legislature of 1871 amended the park\r\nlaw so as to allow the commissioners to buy land for the new park\r\nand made an appropriation for it. The governor now appointed as park\r\ncommissioners, Pinchback, West, and Southworth. They next acquired\r\ntitle to the property, but paid only sixty-five thousand dollars, the\r\nremainder being left on mortgage. August 15 they sold one-half their\r\npurchase to the city for eighty thousand dollars, receiving sixty-five\r\nthousand dollars in cash, and one hundred ninety-five thousand in\r\nbonds. It was common street talk that Antoine complained that Pinchback\r\nhad cheated him out of forty thousand dollars, which he in some way\r\nexpected out of the deal.[361]\r\n\r\nThe evidence fails of proof that the governor ever received a bribe\r\nfor his action on any bill,[362] but it is difficult to escape\r\nthe suspicion of his complicity in corrupt transactions, if it be\r\ntrue, as was alleged, that no bill which the governor favored could\r\nfail and none that he opposed could pass. He admitted his use of\r\nhis patronage to remove personal enemies and appoint friends “as a\r\ncustom of governors”[363] and that the government had been guilty\r\nof some abuses created by his connivance, but emphatically denied\r\nthe perpetration of any frauds,[364] declaring on oath that he stood\r\nbefore the Congressional committee with “clean hands.”[365] But his\r\nduplicity in other ways seems clear, while the fact stands out that\r\nwith a salary of eight thousand dollars a year he testified that he had\r\nmade far more than one hundred thousand dollars the first year of his\r\nadministration[366] and by 1872 was reported worth a million dollars.\r\nHe was surely willfully deluding himself when he uttered this boast:\r\n\r\n  I believe I have since I have been governor of the State, under\r\n  circumstances and embarrassments of the gravest character, and under\r\n  difficulties that I am surprised myself that I have been able to\r\n  overcome, administered the State government in the best interests\r\n  of the people of the State, and have produced as much harmony, good\r\n  feeling, and prosperity as it was possible for me or any one else to\r\n  produce under the circumstances.[367]\r\n\r\nIn a series of remarkable pen pictures the governor brought charges of\r\ndishonesty against most of the custom-house reformers--against Senators\r\nRay, Casey, Packard, Lowell,[368] Carter.[369] His attack on Carter may\r\nbe considered typical:\r\n\r\n  Mr. Carter was also, and is now, the paid attorney of the New\r\n  Orleans, Mobile, and Texas Railroad Company, from which he receives\r\n  $833.33 per month, or $10,000 per annum, and for which he has\r\n  never done one hour’s service. The contract for his employment\r\n  was made with him by the company after he had kept in his pocket\r\n  for thirty or sixty days a bill which had passed the legislature\r\n  almost unanimously, and immediately after this contract was made, by\r\n  which he became the attorney of the company, the bill was signed by\r\n  him.[370]\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men attempted no reply to these charges, and Carter’s\r\nexplanation served only to convince the Congressional committee that\r\nthe charge was substantially true.[371] Casey was clearly proved to\r\nhave been the holder of a corruption fund of $18,000, part of a $50,000\r\nfund raised by himself and others to bribe the legislature to pass a\r\nbill for a company in which he was an interested incorporator. When the\r\ngovernor vetoed the bill, Casey unlocked the safe and Herring returned\r\n$18,000. It required just eighteen senators to pass the bill.[372] The\r\npresident of the Louisiana Lottery Company had a list of about fifty\r\nmembers of the House with whom he had made arrangements for the passage\r\nof the Jackson Railroad bill with the amount that had been paid and the\r\nsum still due. The amount with a few exceptions was $600, but Campbell\r\nand Pinchback were rated worth $2000.[373] Many members held two\r\noffices, quite content to interpret the constitution in the Louisiana\r\nway that a member of the Assembly was not a State officer.[374]\r\n\r\nThe governor made a genuine effort to combat the extravagance of\r\nthe legislature. In April, 1871, soon after the adjournment of the\r\nAssembly, he applied to the courts for an injunction to restrain the\r\nauditor from paying warrants for the mileage, per diem, and contingent\r\nexpenses of members of the lower house, because fraudulent vouchers\r\nhad been issued whereby the amounts had been increased. The injunction\r\nwas granted and the auditor, together with several experts, appointed\r\nto investigate the matter. The governor’s real object was to assail\r\nSpeaker Carter by the allegation that he had coerced the chief clerk\r\nto sign a fraudulent journal of the House, which authorized five\r\ncommittees to sit during the recess, thus defrauding the State of\r\n$200,000. Warmoth declared that a number of resolutions, which the\r\nspeaker stated as introduced and passed the last night, had been\r\ninterpolated into the journal, for it was notorious that they had not\r\nbeen introduced up to half-past eight o’clock that evening, and that\r\nfrom that moment until the adjournment the House had been in a constant\r\nstate of uproar, during which time it was impossible for the House to\r\ntake any action. He advanced what seems considerable evidence of his\r\ncharge, while the delay of the publication of this day’s journal for\r\nsixteen days after the adjournment,[375] looks, it will be confessed,\r\nsuspicious.[376]\r\n\r\nThe report of the commission sustained the charges of the governor\r\nbut in part. It was shown that the amount of the warrants had in some\r\ninstances been fraudulently increased; that warrants to the amount of\r\n$240,000 had been issued in excess of the appropriation of 1871[377];\r\nthat many warrants for extra pay to officers and clerks had been issued\r\non the resolution of but one house, contrary to law; that $40,000 had\r\nbeen fraudulently issued to committees for mileage on official duty,\r\nwhen, according to the journals, they had not left the city; and\r\nthat the signatures of the State officers had been forged in various\r\ninstances. The commission condemned the loose manner of conducting\r\nbusiness in the warrant office, but brought no specific charges. The\r\nopposition press charged the governor with holding up this report for\r\nmonths and publishing it at the opportune moment for him--just before\r\nthe assembling of the legislature in 1872.[378]\r\n\r\nAn important decision in regard to the limitation of the State debt\r\nwas rendered in May by the State Supreme Court. The matter came up on\r\nappeal from the Eighth District Court of New Orleans, where a suit\r\nhad been instituted to compel the auditor to issue a warrant on an\r\nappropriation of $50,000 made in favor of a Mr. Nixon. The auditor had\r\nrefused because the law authorizing it violated the recent amendment,\r\nas it increased the debt above the constitutional limit. The Supreme\r\nCourt affirmed the decision of the lower court in favor of the\r\nauditor, contending that “the evidence in the record leaves no doubt\r\nthat the debt of the State exceeded twenty-five million dollars on or\r\nbefore the first of March, 1871.”[379]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[282] Jan. 15, 1870. “Whereas different persons and separate\r\norganizations are contending for recognition as the Central Republican\r\nClub of the State of Louisiana.... Resolved That the organization\r\nthus attempted be permitted to take a back seat in the gatherings of\r\nthe great Republican party of this state, and that the door of the\r\nRepublican Temple shall hereafter, like gospel gates, stand open night\r\nand day, until all political sinners, including even the erring ones\r\nfrom the New Orleans Customhouse, shall have time and opportunity to\r\nreturn decently and in order to their father’s house.” La.

The governor’s figures vary slightly in\r\ndifferent statements, 194.\r\n\r\n[329] The following total compiled by Secretary Bragdon for\r\nthe governor is suggestive:\r\n\r\n  Public debt for 1860 $10,099,074.32\r\n                  1868  14,347,051.02\r\n                  1870  23,427,952.29\r\n                  1871  22,357,999.05\r\n                  1872  23,045,790.00  _Ibid._, 200.\r\n\r\n\r\n[330] Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, Pt. i., 205.\r\n\r\n$3,658,879 is quoted by Scott from the _Financial Chronicle_, _see_\r\nScott, _Repudiation of State Debts_, 110.\r\n\r\n[331] Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, Pt. i., 205.\r\n_Cf._ Scott, _Repudiation of State Debts_, 100.\r\n\r\n[332] Sen. Jour., 1871, 27, House Jour., 87.\r\n\r\n[333] Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, Pt. i., 358.\r\n\r\n[334] _National Republican_, Jan. 2, 1872.\r\n\r\n[335] Testimony of Eustis, House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2\r\nSess., No. 211, 534.\r\n\r\n[336] Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, Pt. i., 205.\r\nThe _National Republican_ reported September 22, “The regular broker\r\nshuns all dealings with it--city paper--and capitalists scorn it, it is\r\nhawked around by its unfortunate owners--clerks and laborers--and sold\r\nto the first man who offers to buy it.”\r\n\r\n[337] $493,324. Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, Pt.\r\ni., 358.\r\n\r\n[338] Note Herbert’s table comparing the cost in 1871 with\r\nthat under the Democrats before the war, 403.\r\n\r\n[339] Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, 360. Tax\r\nCollector Sheridan said that he cleared about $32,000 in 1871 and\r\n$14,000 in 1872. _Ibid._, 42 Cong., 3 Sess., No. 457, 707. Warmoth\r\ndefended those figures as the usual receipts for the office. _Ibid._,\r\n713-14.\r\n\r\n[340] House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 396.\r\n\r\n[341] Sen. Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 41, Pt. i., 359.\r\n\r\n[342] Governor’s Message, 1872. _Annual Cyclop._, 1871, 471.\r\n\r\n[343] Some committees were authorized to continue during the\r\nrecess, some thirty, some sixty days, some longer.\r\n\r\n[344] The Enrollment Committee had over eighty clerks at $8\r\na day, when not more than ten could be required, according to the\r\ngovernor’s statement.\r\n\r\n[345] The printing bill for the House journals was $68,000,\r\nexclusive of New Orleans. House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211,\r\n38.\r\n\r\n[346] $20,000 was spent in extra mileage above the amount\r\nallowed by law, $40,000 for mileage and per diem of special traveling\r\ncommittees of the House alone. Carter stated that there were thirty-one\r\nstanding committees and twenty special committees with a full\r\ncomplement of clerks. House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 39.\r\n\r\n[347] _National Republican_, Jan. 2, 1872.\r\n\r\n[348] Sen. Jour., 1871, 74.\r\n\r\n[349] House Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 92, 21. The largest\r\nsum ever spent before the war, when they were printed in both English\r\nand French, was $60,000.\r\n\r\n[350] This paper was said to pay a dividend of 110 per cent.\r\nBut the governor denied receiving any dividend. House Misc., Doc., 42\r\nCong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 368.\r\n\r\n[351] _Ibid._, 38. Sometimes papers were opposed merely\r\nbecause others were entitled to the same privileges. House Deb., 4.\r\n\r\n[352] _Ibid._, 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 39. See House\r\nJour., 55 and 129 for a list.\r\n\r\n[353] _Ibid._ He asserted in the Press Convention that his\r\npatronage should not be used against him, and in several cases where\r\npapers asserted this independence, the contracts were revoked. House\r\nMisc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 298.\r\n\r\n[354] Phelps says: “The corruption was so general and so\r\nnotorious that no one connected, directly or indirectly, has escaped\r\nfrom the mess without taint in the eyes of the people.” _Louisiana_,\r\n369.\r\n\r\n[355] Moncure declared that he did not know a public official\r\nwho was not worthy of impeachment. _Ibid._, 53-4.\r\n\r\n[356] House Misc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 38.\r\n\r\n[357] _Ibid._, 238. Another man brought conclusive evidence\r\nand stated that he had witnessed money paid to Carr, Dewees, and\r\nPinchback. _Ibid._, 474. Nordhoff had the original of the following\r\ninteresting document: “Gentlemen of the Finance Committee of La. Levee\r\nCo.: Please pay to Hon. A. W. Faulkner the amount you may deem proper\r\nto pay on account of Levee Bill, I being absent at the time under\r\norders of the House. But I would have voted for the bill had I been\r\nthere. Mr. Faulkner is authorized to sign a receipt for me--Stamps.”\r\nNordhoff, 59. The value of quotations from Nordhoff may be proved by\r\nstating that he declared himself a Republican, never having “voted\r\nany other Federal ticket than the Republican; I have been opposed to\r\nslavery as long as I have had an opinion on any subject except sugar,\r\ncandy and tops; and I am a thorough believer in the capacity of the\r\npeople to rule themselves, even if they are very ignorant, better than\r\nanybody else can rule them.” 10.\r\n\r\n[358] Most telling is the reluctant reply of the governor to\r\nthe question: “Are you able to say from your knowledge, personally\r\nor officially, that all or nearly all of these bills incorporating\r\nmonopolies or granting individuals private valuable franchises are\r\npassed through the legislature by corrupt means?” “I wouldn’t like to\r\nsay that.” House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 400.\r\n\r\n[359] _Ibid._, 534.\r\n\r\n[360] The _Picayune_ had combated this measure in 1869 as an\r\nact of folly then. Sep. 24, 1869.\r\n\r\n[361] Nordhoff, 62.\r\n\r\n[362] The most damaging charge against him was that of a\r\nbribe of $50,000 offered him to sign the Nicholson paving bill. Walsh\r\npublished a card, saying that the governor had refused it because\r\nit was too little. The latter, naturally, denied this and tried to\r\ndisprove it by the unsupported statement of another man, whereupon\r\nWalsh sent the governor a challenge. And so the matter stood--the\r\nunproved assertion of one man against the other. House Misc. Doc., 42\r\nCong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 376.\r\n\r\nBut Scott on the other hand swore that it cost more to get the\r\ngovernor’s signature than to get it through the legislature. It is to\r\nbe regretted that the defense which Mr. Warmoth still expects to write,\r\nbased, the writer understands, upon the fact that he prevented still\r\nmore outrageous wrongs from being perpetrated, has not yet appeared,\r\nas it may throw additional light upon this question. The writer has\r\napplied to him repeatedly in vain for a statement of his position now\r\nafter the lapse of forty years.\r\n\r\n[363] House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 380. He\r\nsaid that he had learned from the Democrats that “to the victors belong\r\nthe spoils.” 369.\r\n\r\n[364] _Ibid._, 358.\r\n\r\n[365] _Ibid._, 351. He declared in a series of replies to\r\ndirect questions that he had never tampered with the election of\r\nmembers, never counseled nor advised such tampering, never held any\r\nstock that he had not paid for, nor had stock presented to him, nor\r\nbeen promised stock on condition of approving a bill incorporating\r\nmonopolies, and never been influenced in any way in his official acts\r\nby any reward or the hope or promise of it. But he admitted having\r\nsigned bills after expiration of the constitutional time limit in order\r\nto “quiet the people.” _Ibid._, 351, 371-2.\r\n\r\n[366] House Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 92, 25.\r\n\r\n[367] House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 374.\r\n\r\n[368] Lowell was a defaulter for a large amount.\r\n\r\n[369] House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 395-6.\r\n\r\n[370] _Ibid._, 396. Carter was an apostatizing preacher and\r\nex-Confederate colonel, who had turned loyal patriot and anti-Warmoth\r\nleader.--Cox, _Three Decades_, p. 561. With this statement might be\r\ncompared Carter’s opinion of Warmoth as voiced in a speech in February,\r\n1872: “Louisiana is afflicted with worse laws and worse administrators\r\nthereof than can be found in ten states of the Union. Henry Clay\r\nWarmoth is the Boss Tweed in Louisiana, except that that amiable\r\nvillain, with all his infamies, is a gentlemen and a saint compared\r\nwith the unscrupulous despot who fills the executive chair of this\r\nstate.”--Cox, _Three Decades of Federal Legislation_, 560.\r\n\r\n[371] House Rpts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 92, 23. Of course\r\nthe men attacked made counter charges against the governor.\r\n\r\n[372] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[373] House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 475; and\r\nHouse Repts., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 92, 26.\r\n\r\n[374] E. W. Dewees, another leader of the House, contended\r\nwith Carr and Carter for eminence. The investigating committee of\r\nCongress reported that he had been under arrest with seven sworn\r\ncharges of burglary against him, and had then obtained of the chief\r\nof police a certificate that his picture was not in the rogues’\r\ngallery.--_Ibid._, 27.\r\n\r\nThe conclusion to which the Congressional committee came is worth\r\nnoting when we recall that they were Republicans: “The world\r\nhas rarely known a legislative body so rank with ignorance and\r\ncorruption.”--_Ibid._, 24. In May, 1875, five members of this\r\nlegislature were indicted for bribery.--_Times._\r\n\r\nIn this revolting catalog it is refreshing to find one person free\r\nfrom the taint of dishonesty. The lieutenant-governor was regarded by\r\nthe Democrats as incorruptible. “In the view of the Caucasian chiefs,\r\nthe taint of honesty and of a scrupulous regard for the official\r\nproprieties, is a serious drawback and enervating reproach upon the\r\nLieutenant Governor.”--_Times_, August 4, 1871.\r\n\r\n[375] House Misc. Doc., 42 Cong., 2 Sess., No. 211, 396. The\r\nfraud took the form of substituting one bill for a similar one which\r\nhad been tabled but purported in the journal to have been taken up\r\nthat night. It was supposed that the delay was due to the loss of the\r\noriginal bill alleged to have been passed.\r\n\r\n[376] It is only fair to add, as Carr pointed out, that the\r\ntestimony of the commission did not bear out these charges.--_Ibid._,\r\n230.\r\n\r\n[377] _Annual Cyclopedia_, 1871, 471. The over issue of the\r\nvouchers forced the value of the warrants down to 2½ cents on the\r\ndollar.--Herbert, _Why the Solid South_, 403.\r\n\r\n[378] _National Republican_, Jan. 2, 1872.\r\n\r\nStrangely enough the report appeared in the _Picayune_, Dec. 29, 1871.\r\n\r\nThat paper printed one of its rare expressions of approval of the\r\ngovernor: “The efforts of the governor to defeat so glaring an\r\ninfringement of the law will meet with general approval. The court has\r\nissued the injunction asked for by the Executive, and in consequence\r\nover three thousand dollars will be saved to the State.”\r\n\r\n[379] 23 La.
