Bush\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe addresses are separated by three asterisks: ***\r\n\r\nDates of addresses by George H.W. Bush in this eBook:\r\n\r\n  January 31, 1990\r\n  January 29, 1991\r\n  January 28, 1992\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge H.W. Bush\r\nJanuary 31, 1990\r\n\r\nTonight, I come not to speak about the \"State of the Government\", not to\r\ndetail every new initiative we plan for the coming year, nor describe every\r\nline in the budget. I'm here to speak to you and to the American people\r\nabout the State of the Union about our world, the changes we've seen, the\r\nchallenges we face. And what that means for America.\r\n\r\nThere are singular moments in history, dates that divide all that goes\r\nbefore from all that comes after. And many of us in this chamber have lived\r\nmuch of our lives in a world whose fundamental features were defined in\r\n1945. And the events of that year decreed the shape of nations, the pace of\r\nprogress, freedom or oppression for millions of people around the world.\r\n\r\nNineteen Forty-Five provided the common frame of reference the compass\r\npoints of the postwar era we've relied upon to understand ourselves. And\r\nthat was our world until now. The events of the year just ended, the\r\nRevolution of '89, have been a chain reaction, changes so striking that it\r\nmarks the beginning of a new era in the world's affairs.\r\n\r\nThink back think back just twelve short months ago to the world we knew as\r\n1989 began.\r\n\r\nOne year, one year ago the people of Panama lived in fear under the thumb\r\nof a dictator. Today democracy is restored. Panama is free.\r\n\r\n\"Operation Just Cause\" has achieved its objective. And the number of\r\nmilitary personel in Panama is now very close to what it was before the\r\noperation began. And tonight I am announcing that before the end of\r\nFebruary the additional numbers of American troops, the brave men and women\r\nof our armed forces who made this mission a success, will be back home.\r\n\r\nA year ago in Poland, Lech Walesa declared he was ready to open a dialogue\r\nwith the Communist rulers of that country. And today, with the future of a\r\nfree Poland in their own hands, members of Solidarity lead the Polish\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nAnd a year ago, freedom's playwright, Vaclav Havel, languished as a\r\nprisoner in Prague. And today it's Vaclav Havel, President of\r\nCzechoslovakia.\r\n\r\nAnd one year ago Erich Honecker of East Germany claimed history as his\r\nguide. He predicted the Berlin Wall would last another hundred years. And\r\ntoday, less than one year later, it's the wall that's history.\r\n\r\nRemarkable events, remarkable events, events that fulfill the long-held\r\nhopes of the American people. Events that validate the longstanding goals\r\nof American policy, a policy based upon a single shining principle: the\r\ncause of freedom.\r\n\r\nAmerica, not just the nation, but an idea alive in the minds of the people,\r\neverywhere. As this new world takes shape, America stands at the center of\r\na widening circle of freedom, today, tomorrow and into the next century.\r\n\r\nOur nation is the enduring dream of every immigrant who ever set foot on\r\nthese shores, and the millions still struggling to be free. This nation,\r\nthis idea called America was and always will be a new world, our new\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAt a workers' rally in a place called Branik on the outskirts of Prague the\r\nidea called America is alive. A worker, dressed in grimy overalls, rises to\r\nspeak at the factory gates. And he begins his speech to his fellow citizens\r\nwith these words, words of a distant revolution: \"We hold these truths to\r\nbe self-evident. That all men are created equal, that they are endowed by\r\ntheir creator with certain unalienable rights, and that among these are\r\nlife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" It's no secret here at home\r\nfreedom's door opened long ago. The cornerstones of this free society have\r\nalready been set in place: democracy, competition, opportunity, private\r\ninvestment, stewardship, and of course, leadership.\r\n\r\nAnd our challenge today is to take this democratic system of ours, a system\r\nsecond to none, and make it better:\r\n\r\nA better America where there's a job for whoever wants one;\r\n\r\nWhere women working outside the home can be confident their children are\r\nin safe and loving care, and where Government works to expand child\r\nalternatives for parents.\r\n\r\nWhere we reconcile the needs of a clean environment and a strong economy.\r\n\r\nWhere \"Made in the USA\" is recognized around the world as the symbol of\r\nquality and progress,\r\n\r\nAnd where every one of us enjoys the same opportunities to live, to work\r\nand to contribute to society. And where, for the first time, the American\r\nmainstream includes all of our disabled citizens.\r\n\r\nWhere everyone has a roof over his head, and where the homeless get the\r\nhelp they need to live in dignity.\r\n\r\nWhere our schools challenge and support our kids and our teachers, and\r\nevery one of them makes the grade,\r\n\r\nWhere every street, every city, every school and every child is drug-free.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, and finally, where no American is forgotten. Our hearts go out\r\nto our hostages, our hostages who are ceaselessly in our minds and in our\r\nefforts. That's part of the future we want to see, the future we can make\r\nfor ourselves. But dreams alone won't get us there. We need to extend our\r\nhorizon, to commit to the long view. And our mission for the future starts\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nIn the tough competitive markets around the world, America faces the great\r\nchallenges and great opportunities. And we know that we can succeed in the\r\nglobal economic arena of the 90's. But to meet that challenge we must make\r\nsome fundamental changes, some crucial investments in ourselves.\r\n\r\nYes, we are going to invest in America. This Administration is determined\r\nto encourage the creation of capital, capital of all kinds. Physical\r\ncapital: everything from our farms and factories to our workshops and\r\nproduction lines, all that is needed to produce and deliver quality goods\r\nand quality services. Intellectual, intellectual capital: the source of\r\nideas that spark tomorrow's products. And of course human capital: the\r\ntalented work force that we'll need to compete in the global market.\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, if we ignore human capital, if we lose the spirit of\r\nAmerican ingenuity, the sprit that is the hallmark of the AMERICAN worker,\r\nthat would be bad. The American worker is the most productive worker in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nWe need to save more. We need to expand the pool of capital for new\r\ninvestments that mean more jobs and more growth. And that's the idea behind\r\nthe new initiative I call the Family Savings Plan, which I will send to\r\nCongress tomorrow.\r\n\r\nWe need to cut the tax on capital gains, encourage, encourage risk-takers,\r\nespecially those in small businesses, to take those steps that translate\r\ninto economic reward, jobs, and a better life for all of us.\r\n\r\nWe'll do what it takes to invest in America's future. The budget commitment\r\nis there. The money is there. It's there for research and development, R\r\nand D, a record high. It's there for our housing initiative, hope, H-O-P-E,\r\nto help everyone from first-time homebuyers to the homeless. The money's\r\nthere to keep our kids drug-free, 70 percent more than when I took office\r\nin 1989. It's there for space exploration, and its there for education,\r\nanother record high.\r\n\r\nAnd one more, and one more thing. Last fall at the education summit, the\r\ngovernors and I agreed to look for ways to help make sure that our kids are\r\nready to learn the very first day they walk into the classroom. And I've\r\nmade good on that commitment by proposing a record increase in funds, an\r\nextra half billion dollars, for something near and dear to all of us: Head\r\nStart.\r\n\r\nEducation is the one investment that means more for our future, because it\r\nmeans the most for our children. Real improvement in our schools is not\r\nsimply a matter of spending more. It's a matter of asking more, expecting\r\nmore, of our schools, our teachers, of our kids, of our parents and of\r\nourselves. And that's why tonight, and that's why tonight, I am announcing\r\nAmerica's education goals, goals developed with enormous cooperation from\r\nthe nation's governors. And if I might I'd like to say I'm very pleased\r\nthat Governor Gardner and Governor Clinton, Governor Branstad, Governor\r\nCampbell, all of whom were very key in these discussion, these\r\ndeliberations, are with us here tonight.\r\n\r\nBy the, by the year 2000, every child must start school ready to learn. The\r\nUnited States must increase the high school graduation rate to no less than\r\n90 percent. And we are going to make sure our schools' diplomas mean\r\nsomething. In critical subjects, at the fourth, eighth, and 12th grades, we\r\nmust assess our students' performance.\r\n\r\nBy the, by the year 2000 U.S. students must be the first in the world in\r\nmath and science achievement. Every American adult must be a skilled,\r\nliterate worker and citizen. Every school must offer the kind of\r\ndisciplined environment that makes it possible for our kids to learn. And\r\nevery school in America must be drug-free.\r\n\r\nAmbitious aims? Of course. Easy to do? Far from it. But the future's at\r\nstake. The nation will not accept anything less than excellence in\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThese investments will help keep America competitive. And I know this about\r\nthe American people: we welcome competition. We'll match our ingenuity, our\r\nenergy, our experience, and technology our spirit and enterprise against\r\nanyone. But let the competition be free, but let it also be fair. America\r\nis ready.\r\n\r\nSince we really mean it, and since we're serious about being ready to meet\r\nour challenge, we're getting our own house in order. We have made real\r\nprogress. Seven years ago, the Federal deficit was 6 percent of our gross\r\nnational product, 6 percent. In the new budget I sent up two days ago the\r\ndeficit is down to 1 percent of GNP.\r\n\r\nThat budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the\r\nGramm-Rudman target. It brings the deficit down further. And balances the\r\nbudget by 1993, with no new taxes.\r\n\r\nAnd let me tell you, there's still more than enough Federal spending. For\r\nmost of us, $1.2 trillion is still a lot of money.\r\n\r\nAnd once the budget is balanced, we can operate the way every family must\r\nwhen it has bills to pay. We won't leave it to our children and\r\ngrandchildren. Once it's balanced, we will start paying off the national\r\ndebt.\r\n\r\nAnd there's something more, and there's something more we owe the\r\ngenerations of the future: stewardship, the safekeeping of America's\r\nprecious environmental inheritance.\r\n\r\nAs just one sign of how serious we are, we will elevate the Environmental\r\nProtection Agency to Cabinet rank. Not, not more bureaucracy, not more red\r\ntape, but the certainty that here at home, and especially in our dealings\r\nwith other nations, environmental issues have the status they deserve.\r\n\r\nThis year's budget provides over $2 billion in new spending to protect our\r\nenvironment, with over $1 billion for global change research, and a new\r\ninitiative I call America the Beautiful to expand our national parks and\r\nwildlife preserves and improve recreational facilities on public lands.\r\n\r\nAnd something else, something that will help keep this country clean, from\r\nour forest land to the inner cities, and keep America beautiful for\r\ngenerations to come, the money to plant a billion trees a year.\r\n\r\nAnd tonight, and tonight let me say again to all the members of the\r\nCongress, the American people did not send us here to bicker. There is work\r\nto do, and they sent us here to get it done. And once again, in the spirit\r\nof cooperation I offer my hand to all of you. And let's work together to do\r\nthe will of the people--clean air, child care, the educational excellence\r\nact, crime and drugs. It's time to act. The farm bill, transportation\r\npolicy, product liability reform, enterprise zones. It's time to act\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nAnd there's one thing I hope we can agree on. It's about our commitments.\r\nAnd I'm talking about Social Security.\r\n\r\nTo every American out there on Social Security, to every, every American\r\nsupporting that system today, and to everyone counting on it when they\r\nretire, we made a promise to you, and we are going to keep it.\r\n\r\nWe, we rescued the system in 1983 and it's sound again, bipartisan\r\narrangement. Our budget fully funds today's benefits and it assures that\r\nfuture benefits will be funded as well. And the last thing we need to do is\r\nmess around with Social Security.\r\n\r\nThere's one more problem we need to address. We must give careful\r\nconsideration to the recommendations of the health care studies under way\r\nnow. And that's why tonight, I am asking Dr. Sullivan, Lou Sullivan,\r\nSecretary of Health and Human Services, to lead a Domestic Policy Council\r\nreview of recommendations on the quality, accessibility and cost of our\r\nnation's health care system. I am committed to bring the staggering costs\r\nof health care under control.\r\n\r\nThe State of the Government does indeed depend on many of us in this very\r\nchamber. But the State of the Union depends on all Americans. We must\r\nmaintain the democratic decency that makes a nation out of millions of\r\nindividuals. And I've been appalled at the recent mail bombings across this\r\ncountry. Every one of us must confront and condemn racism, anti-Semitism,\r\nbigotry and hate. Not next week, not tomorrow, but right now. Every single\r\none of us.\r\n\r\nThe State of the Union depends on whether we help our neighbor, claim the\r\nproblems of our community as our own. We've got to step forward when\r\nthere's trouble, lend a hand, be what I call a point of light to a stranger\r\nin need. We've got to take the time after a busy day to sit down and read\r\nwith our kids, help them with their homework, pass along the values we had\r\nas children. And that's how we sustain the State of the Union.\r\n\r\nEvery effort is important. It all adds up. It's doing the things that give\r\ndemocracy meaning. It all adds up to who we are and who we will be.\r\n\r\nAnd let me say, that so long as we remember the American idea, so long as\r\nwe live up to the American ideal, the State of the Union will remain sound\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\nAnd to those who worry that we've lost our way, well, I want you to listen\r\nto parts of a letter written by James Markwell, Pvt. 1st Class James\r\nMarkwell, a 20-year-old Army medic to the First Battalion, 75th Rangers.\r\nIt's dated Dec. 18, the day before our armed forces went into action in\r\nPanama. It's a letter servicemen write--and hope will never, ever be sent.\r\nAnd sadly, Private Markwell's mother did receive this letter. She passed it\r\non to me out there in Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nAnd here is some of what he wrote: \"I've never been afraid of death, but I\r\nknow he is waiting at the corner...I've been trained to kill and to save,\r\nand so has everyone else. I am frightened of what lays beyond the fog, and\r\nyet... do not mourn for me. Revel in the life that I have died to give\r\nyou... But most of all, don't forget that the Army was my choice. Something\r\nthat I wanted to do. Remember I joined the Army to serve my country and\r\ninure that you are free to do what you want and to live your lives\r\nfreely.\"\r\n\r\nLet me add that Private Markwell was among the first to see battle in\r\nPanama, and among the first to fall. But he knew what he believed in. He\r\ncarried the idea we call America in his heart.\r\n\r\nI began tonight speaking about the changes we've seen this past year. There\r\nis a new world of challenges and opportunities before us. And there is a\r\nneed for leadership that only America can provide.\r\n\r\nNearly 40 years ago, in his last address to the Congress, President Harry\r\nTruman predicted such a time would come. He said, \"As our world grows\r\nstronger, more united, more attractive to men on both sides of the Iron\r\nCurtain, then inevitably there will come a time of change within the\r\nCommunist world.\" Today, that change is taking place.\r\n\r\nFor more than 40 years, America and its allies held Communism in check and\r\ninsured that democracy would continue to exist. And today, with Communism\r\ncrumbling, our aim must be to insure democracy's advance, to take the lead\r\nin forging peace and freedom's best hope, a great and growing commonwealth\r\nof free nations.\r\n\r\nAnd to the Congress and to all Americans, I say it is time to acclaim a new\r\nconsensus at home and abroad, a common vision of the peaceful world we want\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nHere in our own hemisphere it is time for all the people of the Americas,\r\nNorth and South, to live in freedom.\r\n\r\nIn the Far East and Africa, it's time for the full flowering of free\r\ngovernments and free markets that have served the engine of progress.\r\n\r\nIt is time to offer our hand to the emerging democracies of Eastern Europe\r\nso that continent, for too long a continent divided, can see a future whole\r\nand free.\r\n\r\nIt's time to build on our new relationship with the Soviet Union, to\r\nendorse and encourage a peaceful process of internal change toward\r\ndemocracy and economic opportunity.\r\n\r\nWe are in a period of great transition, great hope, and yet great\r\nuncertainty. We recognize that the Soviet military threat in Europe is\r\ndiminishing, but we see little change in Soviet strategic modernization.\r\nAnd, therefore, we must sustain our own strategic offense modernization and\r\nthe Strategic Defense Initiative.\r\n\r\nBut the time is right to move forward on a conventional arms control\r\nagreement to move us to more appropriate levels of military forces in\r\nEurope, a coherent defense program that insures the U.S. will continue to\r\nbe a catalyst for peaceful change in Europe. And I've consulted with\r\nleaders of NATO. In fact I spoke by phone with President Gorbachev just\r\ntoday.\r\n\r\nAnd I agree with our European allies that an American military presence in\r\nEurope is essential and that it should not be solely tied to the Soviet\r\nmilitary presence in Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\nBut our troop levels can still be lower. And so tonight I am announcing a\r\nmajor new step for a further reduction in U.S. and Soviet manpower in\r\nCentral and Eastern Europe to 195,000 on each side.\r\n\r\nThis number, this number, this level, reflects the advice of our senior\r\nmilitary advisers. It's designed to protect American and European interests\r\nand sustain NATO's defense strategy. A swift conclusion to our arms control\r\ntalks--conventional, chemical and strategic--must now be our goal. And\r\nthat time has come.\r\n\r\nStill, we must recognize an unfortunate fact: in many regions of the world\r\ntonight the reality is conflict, not peace. Enduring animosities and\r\nopposing interests remain. And thus the cause of peace must be served by an\r\nAmerica strong enough and sure enough to defend our interests and our\r\nideals. It's this American idea that for the past four decades helped\r\ninspire the Revolution of '89.\r\n\r\nAnd here at home, and in the world, there is history in the making, and\r\nhistory to be made. Six months ago, early in this season of change, I stood\r\nat the gates of the Gdansk shipyard in Poland at the monument to the fallen\r\nworkers of Solidarity. It's a monument of simple majesty. Three tall\r\ncrosses rise up from the stones, and atop each cross, an anchor, an ancient\r\nsymbol of hope.\r\n\r\nThe anchor in our world today is freedom. Holding us steady in times of\r\nchange, a symbol of hope to all the world. And freedom is at the very heart\r\nof the idea that is America. Giving life to the idea depends on every one\r\nof us. Our anchor has always been faith and family.\r\n\r\nIn the last few days of this past monumentous year, our family was blessed\r\nonce more, celebrating the joy of life when a little boy became our 12th\r\ngrandchild. When I held the little guy for the first time, the troubles at\r\nhome and abroad seemed manageable, and totally in perspective.\r\n\r\nAnd now I know, I know you're probably thinking, Well, that's just a\r\ngrandfather talking.\r\n\r\nWell, maybe you're right. But I've met a lot of children this past year\r\nacross this country, as all of you have. Everywhere from the Far East to\r\nEastern Europe. All kids are unique. Yet, all kids are alike. The budding\r\nyoung environmentalist I met this month, who joined me in exploring the\r\nFlorida Everglades. The Little Leaguers I played catch with in Poland,\r\nready to go from Warsaw to the World Series. And even the kids who are ill\r\nor alone--and God bless those boarder babies, born addicted to drugs and\r\nAIDS--coping with problems no child should have to face. But, you know,\r\nwhen it comes to hope and the future, every kid is the same: full of\r\ndreams, ready to take on the world, all special because they are the very\r\nfuture of freedom. And to them belongs this new world I've been speaking\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nAnd so tonight, I'm going to ask something of every one of you. Now let me\r\nstart with my generation, with the grandparents out there. You are our\r\nliving link with the past. Tell your grandchildren the story of struggles\r\nwaged at home and abroad, of sacrifices freely made for freedom's sake. And\r\ntell them your own story as well, because every American has a story to\r\ntell.\r\n\r\nAnd parents, your children look to you for direction and guidance. Tell\r\nthem of faith and family. Tell them we are one nation under God. Teach them\r\nthat of all the many gifts they can receive, liberty is their most precious\r\nlegacy. And of all the gifts they can give, the greatest, the greatest is\r\nhelping others.\r\n\r\nAnd to the children and young people out there tonight, with you rests our\r\nhope, all that America will mean in the years and decades ahead. Fix your\r\nvision on a new century, your century, on dreams we cannot see, on the\r\ndestiny that is yours and yours alone.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, let all Americans, all of us here in this chamber, the\r\nsymbolic center of democracy, affirm our allegiance to this idea we call\r\nAmerica. And let us remember that the State of the Union depends upon each\r\nand every one of us.\r\n\r\nGod bless all of you. And may God bless this great nation, the United\r\nStates of America.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge H.W. Bush\r\nJanuary 29, 1991\r\n\r\nMr. President, Mr. Speaker, members of the United States Congress.\r\n\r\nI come to this house of the people to speak to you and all Americans,\r\ncertain we stand at a defining hour.\r\n\r\nHalfway around the world, we are engaged in a great struggle in the skies\r\nand on the seas and sands. We know why we're there. We are Americans--part\r\nof something larger than ourselves.\r\n\r\nFor two centuries we've done the hard work of freedom. And tonight we lead\r\nthe world in facing down a threat to decency and humanity.\r\n\r\nWhat is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea--a new\r\nworld order, where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to\r\nachieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom,\r\nand the rule of law. Such is a world worthy of our struggle, and worthy of\r\nour children's future.\r\n\r\nThe community of nations has resolutely gathered to condemn and repel\r\nlawless aggression. Saddam Hussein's unprovoked invasion--his ruthless,\r\nsystematic rape of a peaceful neighbor--violated everything the community\r\nof nations holds dear. The world has said this aggression would not stand,\r\nand it will not stand.\r\n\r\nTogether, we have resisted the trap of appeasement, cynicism and isolation\r\nthat gives temptation to tyrants. The world has answered Saddam's invasion\r\nwith 12 United Nations resolutions, starting with a demand for Iraq's\r\nimmediate and unconditional withdrawal, and backed up by forces from 28\r\ncountries of six continents. With few exceptions, the world now stands as\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe end of the cold war has been a victory for all humanity. A year and a\r\nhalf ago, in Germany, I said our goal was a Europe whole and free. Tonight,\r\nGermany is united. Europe has become whole and free, and America's\r\nleadership was instrumental in making it possible.\r\n\r\nThe principle that has guided us is simple: our objective is to help the\r\nBaltic peoples achieve their aspirations, not to punish the Soviet Union.\r\nIn our recent discussions with the Soviet leadership we have been given\r\nrepresentations, which, if fulfilled, would result in the withdrawal of\r\nsome Soviet forces, a re-opening of dialogue with the republics, and a move\r\naway from violence.\r\n\r\nWe will watch carefully as the situation develops. And we will maintain our\r\ncontact with the Soviet leadership to encourage continued commitment to\r\ndemocratization and reform.\r\n\r\nIf it is possible, I want to continue to build a lasting basis for\r\nU.S.-Soviet cooperation, for a more peaceful future for all mankind.\r\n\r\nThe triumph of democratic ideas in Eastern Europe and Latin America, and\r\nthe continuing struggle for freedom elsewhere around the world all confirm\r\nthe wisdom of our nation's founders.\r\n\r\nTonight, we work to achieve another victory, a victory over tyranny and\r\nsavage aggression.\r\n\r\nWe in this Union enter the last decade of the 20th Century thankful for all\r\nour blessings, steadfast in our purpose, aware of our difficulties and\r\nresponsive to our duties at home and around the world.\r\n\r\nFor two centuries, America has served the world as an inspiring example of\r\nfreedom and democracy. For generations, America has led the struggle to\r\npreserve and extend the blessings of liberty. And today, in a rapidly\r\nchanging world, American leadership is indispensable. Americans know that\r\nleadership brings burdens, and requires sacrifice.\r\n\r\nBut we also know why the hopes of humanity turn to us. We are Americans; we\r\nhave a unique responsibility to do the hard work of freedom. And when we\r\ndo, freedom works.\r\n\r\nThe conviction and courage we see in the Persian Gulf today is simply the\r\nAmerican character in action. The indomitable spirit that is contributing\r\nto this victory for world peace and justice is the same spirit that gives\r\nus the power and the potential to meet our challenges at home.\r\n\r\nWe are resolute and resourceful. If we can selflessly confront evil for the\r\nsake of good in a land so far away, then surely we can make this land all\r\nit should be.\r\n\r\nIf anyone tells you America's best days are behind her, they're looking the\r\nwrong way.\r\n\r\nTonight, I come before this house, and the American people, with an appeal\r\nfor renewal. This is not merely a call for new government initiatives, it\r\nis a call for new initiative in government, in our communities, and from\r\nevery American--to prepare for the next American century.\r\n\r\nAmerica has always led by example. So who among us will set this example?\r\nWhich of our citizens will lead us in this next American century? Everyone\r\nwho steps forward today, to get one addict off drugs; to convince one\r\ntroubled teen-ager not to give up on life; to comfort one AIDS patient; to\r\nhelp one hungry child.\r\n\r\nWe have within our reach the promise of renewed America. We can find\r\nmeaning and reward by serving some purpose higher than ourselves--a\r\nshining purpose, the illumination of a thousand points of light. It is\r\nexpressed by all who know the irresistible force of a child's hand, of a\r\nfriend who stands by you and stays there--a volunteer's generous gesture,\r\nan idea that is simply right.\r\n\r\nThe problems before us may be different, but the key to solving them\r\nremains the same: it is the individual--the individual who steps forward.\r\nAnd the state of our Union is the union of each of us, one to the other:\r\nthe sum of our friendships, marriages, families and communities.\r\n\r\nWe all have something to give. So if you know how to read, find someone who\r\ncan't. If you've got a hammer, find a nail. If you're not hungry, not\r\nlonely, not in trouble--seek out someone who is.\r\n\r\nJoin the community of conscience. Do the hard work of freedom. That will\r\ndefine the state of our Union.\r\n\r\nSince the birth of our nation, \"we the people\" has been the source of our\r\nstrength. What government can do alone is limited, but the potential of the\r\nAmerican people knows no limits.\r\n\r\nWe are a nation of rock-solid realism and clear-eyed idealism. We are\r\nAmericans. We are the nation that believes in the future. We are the nation\r\nthat can shape the future.\r\n\r\nAnd we've begun to do just that, by strengthening the power and choice of\r\nindividuals and families.\r\n\r\nTogether, these last two years, we've put dollars for child care directly\r\nin the hands of patients instead of bureaucracies, unshackled the potential\r\nof Americans with disabilities, applied the creativity of the marketplace in\r\nthe service of the environment, for clean air, and made homeownership\r\npossible for more Americans.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a democracy is not in bureaucracy, it is in the people and\r\ntheir communities. In everything we do, let us unleash the potential of our\r\nmost precious resource--our citizens. We must return to families,\r\ncommunities, counties, cities, states and institutions of every kind, the\r\npower to chart their own destiny, and the freedom and opportunity provided\r\nby strong economic growth. That's what America is all about.\r\n\r\nI know, tonight, in some regions of our country, people are in genuine\r\neconomic distress. I hear them.\r\n\r\nEarlier this month Kathy Blackwell of Massachusetts wrote me about what can\r\nhappen when the economy slows down, saying, \"My heart is aching, and I\r\nthink that you should know--your people out here are hurting badly.\"\r\n\r\nI understand. And I'm not unrealistic about the future. But there are\r\nreasons to be optimistic about our economy.\r\n\r\nFirst, we don't have to fight double-digit inflation. Second, most\r\nindustries won't have to make big cuts in production because they don't\r\nhave big inventories piled up. And third, our exports are running solid and\r\nstrong. In fact, American businesses are exporting at a record rate.\r\n\r\nSo let's put these times in perspective. Together, since 1981, we've\r\ncreated almost 20 million jobs, cut inflation in half and cut interest\r\nrates in half.\r\n\r\nYes, the largest peacetime economic expansion in history has been\r\ntemporarily interrupted. But our economy is still over twice as large as\r\nour closest competitor.\r\n\r\nWe will get this recession behind us and return to growth soon. We will get\r\non our way to a new record of expansion, and achieve the competitive\r\nstrength that will carry us into the next American century.\r\n\r\nWe should focus our efforts today on encouraging economic growth, investing\r\nin the future and giving power and opportunity to the individual.\r\n\r\nWe must begin with control of Federal spending. That's why I'm submitting a\r\nbudget that holds the growth in spending to less than the rate of\r\ninflation. And that's why, amid all the sound and fury of last year's\r\nbudget debate, we put into law new, enforceable spending caps so that\r\nfuture spending debates will mean a battle of ideas, not a bidding war.\r\n\r\nThough controversial, the budget agreement finally put the Federal\r\nGovernment on a pay-as-you-go basis, and cut the growth of debt by nearly\r\n$500 billion. And that frees funds for saving and job-creating investment.\r\n\r\nNow, let's do more. My budget again includes tax-free family savings\r\naccounts; penalty-free withdrawals from I. R. A.'s for first-time\r\nhomebuyers; and, to increase jobs and growth, a reduced tax for long-term\r\ncapital gains.\r\n\r\nI know their are differences among us about the impact and the effects of a\r\ncapital gains incentive. So tonight I am asking the Congressional leaders\r\nand the Federal Reserve to cooperate with us in a study, led by Chairman\r\nAlan Greenspan, to sort out our technical differences so that we can avoid\r\na return to unproductive partisan bickering.\r\n\r\nBut just as our efforts will bring economic growth now and in the future,\r\nthey must also be matched by long-term investments for the next American\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nThat requires a forward-looking plan of action, and that's exactly what we\r\nwill be sending to the Congress. We have prepared a detailed series of\r\nproposals, that include: A budget that promotes investment in America's\r\nfuture--in children, education, infrastructure, space and high technology.\r\nLegislation to achieve excellence in education, building on the partnership\r\nforged with the 50 governors at the education summit, enabling parents to\r\nchoose their children's schools and helping to make America No. 1 in math\r\nand science. A blueprint for a new national highway system, a critical\r\ninvestment in our transportation infrastructure. A research and development\r\nagenda that includes record levels of Federal investment and a permanent\r\ntax credit to strengthen private R and D and create jobs. A comprehensive\r\nnational energy strategy that calls for energy conservation and efficiency,\r\nincreased development and greater use of alternative fuels. A banking\r\nreform plan to bring America's financial system into the 21st Century, so\r\nthat our banks remain safe and secure and can continue to make job-creating\r\nloans for our factories, businesses, and homebuyers. I do think there has\r\nbeen too much pessimism. Sound banks should be making more sound loans,\r\nnow. And interest rates should be lower, now. In addition to these\r\nproposals, we must recognize that our economic strength depends upon being\r\ncompetitive in world markets. We must continue to expand America's exports.\r\nA successful Uruguay Round of world trade negotiations will create more\r\nreal jobs, and more real growth, for all nations. You and I know that if\r\nthe playing field is level, America's workers and farmers can outwork and\r\noutproduce anyone, anytime, anywhere.\r\n\r\nAnd with the Mexican free trade agreement and our Enterprise for the\r\nAmericas Initiative we can help our partners strengthen their economies and\r\nmove toward a free trade zone throughout this entire hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe budget also includes a plan of action right here at home to put more\r\npower and opportunity in the hands of the individual. That means new\r\nincentives to create jobs in our inner cities by encouraging investment\r\nthrough enterprise zones. It also means tenant control and ownership of\r\npublic housing. Freedom and the power to choose should not be the privilege\r\nof wealth. They are the birthright of every American.\r\n\r\nCivil rights are also crucial to protecting equal opportunity. Every one of\r\nus has a responsibility to speak out against racism, bigotry, and hate. We\r\nwill continue our vigorous enforcement of existing statutes, and I will once\r\nagain press the Congress to strengthen the laws against employment\r\ndiscrimination without resorting to the use of unfair preferences.\r\n\r\nWe're determined to protect another fundamental civil right: freedom from\r\ncrime and the fear that stalks our cities. The Attorney General will soon\r\nconvene a crime summit of the nation's law-enforcement officials. And to\r\nhelp us support them we need a tough crime control legislation, and we need\r\nit now.\r\n\r\nAs we fight crime, we will fully implement our nation strategy for\r\ncombatting drug abuse. Recent data show we are making progress, but much\r\nremains to be done. We will not rest until the day of the dealer is over,\r\nforever.\r\n\r\nGood health care is every American's right and every American's\r\nresponsibility. So we are proposing an aggression program of new prevention\r\ninitiatives--for infants, for children, for adults, and for the elderly--\r\nto promote a healthier America and to help keep costs from spiraling.\r\n\r\nIt's time to give people more choice in government by reviving the ideal of\r\nthe citizen politician who comes not to stay, but to serve. One of the\r\nreasons there is so much support for term limitations is that the American\r\npeople are increasingly concerned about big-money influence in politics.\r\nWe must look beyond the next election, to the next generation. The time has\r\ncome to put the national interest ahead of the special interest--and\r\ntotally eliminate political action committees.\r\n\r\nThat would truly put more competition in elections and more power in the\r\nhands of individuals. And where power cannot be put directly into the hands\r\nof the individual, it should be moved closer to the people--away from\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe federal government too often treats government programs as if they are\r\nof Washington, by Washington, and for Washington. Once established, federal\r\nprograms seem to become immortal.\r\n\r\nIt's time for a more dynamic program life cycle. Some programs should\r\nincrease. Some should decrease. Some should be terminated. And some should\r\nbe consolidated and turned over to the states.\r\n\r\nMy budget includes a list of programs for potential turnover totaling more\r\nthan $20 billion. Working with Congress and the governors, I propose we\r\nselect at least $15 billion in such programs and turn them over to the\r\nstates in a single consolidated grant, fully funded, for flexible\r\nmanagement by the states.\r\n\r\nThe value of this turnover approach is straightforward. It allows the\r\nFederal Government to reduce overhead. It allows states to manage more\r\nflexibly and more efficiently. It moves power and decision-making closer to\r\nthe people. And it re-enforces a theme of this Administration: appreciation\r\nand encouragement of the innovative power of \"states as laboratories.\"\r\n\r\nThis nation was founded by leaders who understood that power belongs in the\r\nhands of the people. They planned for the future. And so must we--here and\r\naround the world.\r\n\r\nAs Americans, we know there are times when we must step forward and accept\r\nour responsibility to lead the world away from the dark chaos of dictators,\r\ntoward the bright promise of a better day.\r\n\r\nAlmost 50 years ago, we began a long struggle against aggressive\r\ntotalitarianism. Now we face another defining hour for America and the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThere is no one more devoted, more committed to the hard work of freedom,\r\nthan every soldier and sailor, every marine, airman and coastguardsman--\r\nevery man and every woman now serving in the Persian Gulf.\r\n\r\nEach of them has volunteered to provide for this nation's defense. And now\r\nthey bravely struggle to earn for America and for the world and for future\r\ngenerations, a just and lasting peace.\r\n\r\nOur commitment to them must be equal of their commitment to our country.\r\nThey are truly America's finest.\r\n\r\nThe war in the gulf is not a war we wanted. We worked hard to avoid war.\r\nFor more than five months we, along with the Arab League, the European\r\nCommunity and the United Nations, tried every diplomatic avenue. U.N.\r\nSecretary General Perez de Cuellar; Presidents Gorbachev, Mitterand, Ozal,\r\nMubarak, and Bendjedid; Kings Fahd and Hassan; Prime Ministers Major and\r\nAndreotti--just to name a few--all worked for a solution. But time and\r\nagain Saddam Hussein flatly rejected the path of diplomacy and peace.\r\n\r\nThe world well knows how this conflict began, and when: it began on August\r\n2nd, when Saddam invaded and sacked a small, defenseless neighbor. And I am\r\ncertain of how it will end. So that peace can prevail, we will prevail.\r\n\r\nTonight I'm pleased to report that we are on course. Iraq's capacity to\r\nsustain war is being destroyed. Our investment, our training, our planning\r\n--all are paying off. Time will not be Saddam's salvation.\r\n\r\nOur purpose in the Persian Gulf remains constant: to drive Iraq out from\r\nKuwait, to restore Kuwait's legitimate government, and to insure the\r\nstability and security of this critical region.\r\n\r\nLet me make clear what I mean by the region's stability and security. We do\r\nnot seek the destruction of Iraq, its culture or its people. Rather, we\r\nseek an Iraq that uses its great resources not to destroy, not to serve the\r\nambitions of a tyrant, but to build a better life for itself and its\r\nneighbors. We seek a Persian Gulf where conflict is no longer the rule,\r\nwhere the strong are neither tempted nor able to intimidate the weak.\r\n\r\nMost Americans know instinctively why we are in the Gulf. They know we had\r\nto stop Saddam now, not later. They know this brutal dictator will do\r\nanything, will use any weapon, will commit any outrage, no matter how many\r\ninnocents must suffer.\r\n\r\nThey know we must make sure that control of the world's oil resources does\r\nnot fall into his hands only to finance further aggression. They know that\r\nwe need to build a new, enduring peace--based not on arms races and\r\nconfrontation, but on shared principles and the rule of law.\r\n\r\nAnd we all realize that our responsibility to be the catalyst for peace in\r\nthe region does not end with the successful conclusion of this war.\r\n\r\nDemocracy brings the undeniable value of thoughtful dissent, and we have\r\nheard some dissenting voices here at home, some reckless, most responsible.\r\nBut the fact the all the voices have the right to speak out is one of the\r\nreasons we've been united in principle and purpose for 200 years.\r\n\r\nOur progress in this great struggle is the result of years of vigilance and\r\na steadfast commitment to a strong defense. Now, with remarkable\r\ntechnological advances like the Patriot missile, we can defend the\r\nballistic missile attacks aimed at innocent civilians.\r\n\r\nLooking forward, I have directed that the S.D.I. program be refocused on\r\nproviding protection from limited ballistic missile strikes, whatever their\r\nsource. Let us pursue an S.D.I. program that can deal with any future\r\nthreat to the United States, to our forces overseas and to our friends and\r\nallies.\r\n\r\nThe quality of American technology, thanks to the American worker, has\r\nenabled us to successfully deal with difficult military conditions, and\r\nhelp minimize the loss of life. We have given our men and women the very\r\nbest. And they deserve it.\r\n\r\nWe all have a special place in our hearts for the families of men and women\r\nserving in the Gulf. They are represented here tonight, by Mrs. Norman\r\nSchwarzkopf, and to all those serving with him. And to the families, let me\r\nsay, our forces in the gulf will not stay there one day longer than is\r\nnecessary to complete their mission.\r\n\r\nThe courage and success of the R.A.F. pilots--of the Kuwaiti, Saudi,\r\nFrench, Canadians, Italians, the pilots of Qatar and Bahrain--all are\r\nproof that for the first time since World War II, the international\r\ncommunity is united. The leadership of the United Nations, once only a\r\nhoped-for ideal, is now confirming its founders' vision.\r\n\r\nI am heartened that we are not being asked to bear alone the financial\r\nburden of this struggle. Last year, our friends and allies provided the\r\nbulk of the economic costs of Desert Shield, and having now received\r\ncommitments of over $40 billion for the first three months of 1991, I am\r\nconfident they will do no less as we move through Desert Storm.\r\n\r\nBut the world has to wonder what the dictator of Iraq is thinking. If he\r\nthinks that by targeting innocent civilians in Israel and Saudi Arabia,\r\nthat he will gain an advantage--he is dead wrong. If he thinks that he\r\nwill advance his cause through tragic and despicable environmental\r\nterrorism--he is dead wrong. And if he thinks that by abusing coalition\r\nP.O.W.s, he will benefit--he is dead wrong.\r\n\r\nWe will succeed in the Gulf. And when we do, the world community will have\r\nsent an enduring warning to any dictator or despot, present or future, who\r\ncontemplates outlaw aggression.\r\n\r\nThe world can therefore seize this opportunity to fulfill the long-held\r\npromise of a new world order--where brutality will go unrewarded, and\r\naggression will meet collective resistance.\r\n\r\nYes, the United States bears a major share of leadership in this effort.\r\nAmong the nations of the world, only the United States of America has had\r\nboth the moral standing, and the means to back it up. We are the only\r\nnation on this earth that could assemble the forces of peace.\r\n\r\nThis is the burden of leadership--and the strength that has made America\r\nthe beacon of freedom in a searching world.\r\n\r\nThis nation has never found glory in war. Our people have never wanted to\r\nabandon the blessings of home and work, for distant lands and deadly\r\nconflict. If we fight in anger, it is only because we have to fight at all.\r\nAnd all of us yearn for a world where we will never have to fight again.\r\n\r\nEach of us will measure, within ourselves, the value of this great\r\nstruggle. Any cost in lives is beyond our power to measure. But the cost of\r\nclosing our eyes to aggression is beyond mankind's power to imagine.\r\n\r\nThis we do know: Our cause is just. Our cause is moral. Our cause is\r\nright.\r\n\r\nLet future generations understand the burden and the blessings of freedom.\r\nLet them say, we stood where duty required us to stand.\r\n\r\nLet them know that together, we affirmed America, and the world, as a\r\ncommunity of conscience.\r\n\r\nThe winds of change are with us now. The forces of freedom are united. We\r\nmove toward the next century, more confident than ever, that we have the\r\nwill at home and abroad, to do what must be done--the hard work of\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nMay God bless the United States of America.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nState of the Union Address\r\nGeorge H.W. Bush\r\nJanuary 28, 1992\r\n\r\nMr. Speaker, Mr. President, distinguished members of Congress, honored\r\nguests and fellow citizens:\r\n\r\nI mean to speak tonight of big things, of big changes and the promises they\r\nhold and of some big problems and how together we can solve them and move\r\nour country forward as the undisputed leader of the age.\r\n\r\nWe gather tonight at a dramatic and deeply promising time in our history,\r\nand in the history of man on earth. For in the past 12 months, the world\r\nhas known changes of almost biblical proportions. And even now, months\r\nafter the failed coup that doomed a failed system, I am not sure we have\r\nabsorbed the full impact, the full import of what happened.\r\n\r\nBut Communism died this year. Even as President, with the most fascinating\r\npossible vantage point, there were times when I was so busy helping to\r\nmanage progress and lead change that I didn't always show the joy that was\r\nin my heart But the biggest thing that has happened in the world in my\r\nlife, in our lives, is this: By the grace of God, America won the Cold War.\r\nAnd there's another to be singled out, though it may seem inelegant. I mean\r\na mass of people called the American taxpayer. No ever thinks to thank the\r\npeople who pay country's bill or an alliance's bill. But for a half Century\r\nnow, the American people have shouldered the burden and paid taxes that\r\nwere higher than they would have been to support a defense that was bigger\r\nthan it would have been if imperial communism had never existed. But it\r\ndid. But it doesn't anymore. And here is a fact I wouldn't mind the world\r\nacknowledging: The American taxpayer bore the brunt of the burden, and\r\ndeserves a hunk of the glory.\r\n\r\nAnd so, now, for the first time in 35 years, our strategic bombers stand\r\ndown. No longer are they on round-the-clock alert. Tomorrow our children\r\nwill go to school and study history and how plants grow. And they won't\r\nhave, as my children did, air-raid drills in which they crawl under their\r\ndesks and cover their heads in case of nuclear war. My grandchildren don't\r\nhave to do that, and won't have the bad dreams children once had in decades\r\npast. There are still threats. But the long drawn-out dread is over.\r\n\r\nA year ago tonight I spoke to you at a moment of high peril. American\r\nforces had just unleashed Operation Desert Storm. And after 40 days in the\r\ndesert skies and 4 days on the ground, the men and women of America's armed\r\nforces and our allies accomplished the goals that I declared, and that you\r\nendorsed: we liberated Kuwait.\r\n\r\nSoon after, the Arab world and Israel sat down to talk seriously, and\r\ncomprehensively, about peace, an historic first. And soon after that, at\r\nChristmas, the last American hostages came home. Our policies were\r\nvindicated.\r\n\r\nMuch good can come from the prudent use of power. And much good can come\r\nfrom this: A world once divided into two armed camps now recognizes one\r\nsole and pre-eminent power, the United States of America. And this they\r\nregard with no dread. For the world trusts us with power, and the world is\r\nright. They trust us to be fair, and restrained. They trust us to be on the\r\nside of decency. They trust us to do what's right.\r\n\r\nI use those words advisedly. A few days after the war began, I received a\r\ntelegram from Joanne Speicher, the wife of the first pilot killed in the\r\ngulf, Lieutenant Commander Scott Speicher. Even in her grief, she wanted me\r\nto know that some day, when her children were old enough, she would tell\r\nthem \"that their father went away to war because it was the right thing to\r\ndo\". She said it all. It was the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nAnd we did it together. There were honest differences here, in this\r\nchamber. But when the war began, you put your partisanship aside and\r\nsupported our troops. This is still a time for pride, but this is no time\r\nto boast. For problems face us, and we must stand together once again and\r\nsolve them--and not let our country down.\r\n\r\nTwo years ago, I began planning cuts in military spending that reflected\r\nthe changes of the new era. But now, this year, with Imperial Communism\r\ngone, that process can be accelerated. Tonight I can tell you of dramatic\r\nchanges in our strategic nuclear force. These are actions we are taking on\r\nour own, because they are the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nAfter completing 20 planes for which we have begun procurement, we will\r\nshut down production of the B-2 bomber. We will cancel the ICBM program. We\r\nwill cease production of new warheads for our sea-based missiles. We will\r\nstop all production of the peacekeeper missile. And we will not purchase\r\nany more advanced cruise missiles.\r\n\r\nThis weekend I will meet at Camp David with Boris Yeltsin of the Russian\r\nFederation. I have informed President Yeltsin that if the commonwealth, the\r\nformer Soviet Union, will eliminate all land-based multiple-warhead\r\nballistic missiles, I will do the following: We will eliminate all\r\nPeacekeeper missiles. We will reduce the number of warheads on Minuteman\r\nmissiles to one and reduce the number of warheads on our sea-based missiles\r\nby about one-third. And we will convert a substantial portion of our\r\nstrategic to primarily conventional use.\r\n\r\nPresident Yeltsin's early response has been very positive, and I expect our\r\ntalks at Camp David to be fruitful. I want you to know that for half a\r\ncentury, American presidents have longed to make such decisions and say\r\nsuch words. But even in the midst of celebration, we must keep caution as a\r\nfriend. For the world is still a dangerous place. Only the dead have seen\r\nthe end of conflict. And though yesterday's challenges are behind us,\r\ntomorrow's are being born.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of defense recommended these cuts after consultation with the\r\njoint chiefs of staff. And I make them with confidence. But do not\r\nmisunderstand me: The reductions I have approved will save us an additional\r\n$50 billion over the next five years. By 1997 we will have cut defense by\r\n30 percent since I took office. These cuts are deep, and you must know my\r\nresolve: this deep, and no deeper. To do less would be insensible to\r\nprogress, but to do more would be ignorant of history. We must not go back\r\nto the days of \"the hollow army\". We cannot repeat the mistakes made twice\r\nin this century when armistice was followed by recklessness and defense was\r\npurged as if the world was permanently safe.\r\n\r\nI remind you this evening that I have asked for your support in funding a\r\nprogram to protect our country from limited nuclear missile attack. We must\r\nhave this protection because too many people in too many countries have\r\naccess to nuclear arms. There are those who say that now we can turn away\r\nfrom the world, that we have no special role, no special place. But we are\r\nthe United States of America, the leader of the West that has become the\r\nleader of the world.\r\n\r\nAs long as I am President we will continue to lead in support of freedom\r\neverywhere, not out of arrogance and not out of altruism, but for the\r\nsafety and security of our children. This is a fact: Strength in the\r\npursuit of peace is no vice; isolationism in the pursuit of security is no\r\nvirtue.\r\n\r\nNow to our troubles at home. They are not all economic, but the primary\r\nproblem is our economy. There are some good signs. Inflation, that thief,\r\nis down, and interest rates are down. But unemployment is too high, some\r\nindustries are in trouble and growth is not what it should be. Let me tell\r\nyou right from the start and right from the heart: I know we're in hard\r\ntimes, but I know something else: This will not stand.\r\n\r\nMy friends in this chamber, we can bring the same courage and sense of\r\ncommon purpose to the economy that we brought to Desert Storm. And we can\r\ndefeat hard times together. I believe you will help. One reason is that\r\nyou're patriots, and you want the best for your country. And I believe that\r\nin your hearts you want to put partisanship aside and get the job done,\r\nbecause it's the right thing to do.\r\n\r\nThe power of America rests in a stirring but simple idea: that people will\r\ndo great things if only you set them free. Well, we're going to have to set\r\nthe economy free, for if this age of miracles and wonders has taught us\r\nanything, it's that if we can change the world, we can change America.\r\n\r\nWe must encourage investment. We must make it easier for people to invest\r\nmoney and make new products, new industries, and new jobs. We must clear\r\naway obstacles to new growth: high taxes, high regulation, red tape, and\r\nyes, wasteful government spending. None of this will happen with a snap of\r\nthe fingers, but it will happen. And the test of a plan isn't whether it's\r\ncalled new or dazzling. The American people aren't impressed by gimmicks.\r\nThey're smarter on this score than all of us in this room. The only test of\r\na plan is, It is sound and will it work? We must have a short-term plan to\r\naddress our immediate needs and heat up the economy. And then we need a\r\nlong-term plan to keep the combustion going and to guarantee our place in\r\nthe world economy.\r\n\r\nThere are certain things that a president can do without Congress, and I am\r\ngoing to do them. I have this evening asked major cabinet departments and\r\nfederal agencies to institute a 90-day moratorium on any new federal\r\nregulations that could hinder growth. In those 90 days, major departments\r\nand agencies will carry out a top-to-bottom review of all regulations, old\r\nand new, to stop the ones that will hurt growth and speed up those that\r\nwill help growth.\r\n\r\nFurther, for the untold number of hard-working, responsible American\r\nworkers and businessmen and women who've been forced to go without needed\r\nbank loans, the banking credit crunch must end. I won't neglect my\r\nresponsibility for sound regulations that serve the public good, but\r\nregulatory overkill must be stopped. And I have instructed our government\r\nregulators to stop it.\r\n\r\nI have directed Cabinet departments and federal agencies to speed up\r\npro-growth expenditures as quickly as possible. This should put an extra\r\n$10 billion into the economy in the next six months. And our new\r\ntransportation bill provides more than $150 billion for construction and\r\nmaintenance projects that are vital to our growth and well-being. That\r\nmeans jobs building roads, jobs building bridges and jobs building\r\nrailways. And I have this evening directed the secretary of the Treasury to\r\nchange the federal tax withholding tables. With this change, millions of\r\nAmericans from whom the government withholds more than necessary can now\r\nchoose to have the government withhold less from their paychecks. Something\r\ntells me a number of taxpayers may take us up on this one. This initiative\r\ncould return about $25 billion back into the economy over the next 12\r\nmonths, money people can use to help pay for clothing, college or a new\r\ncar. And finally, working with the Federal Reserve, we will continue to\r\nsupport monetary policy that keeps both interest rates and inflation down.\r\n\r\nNow these are the things that I can do. And now, members of Congress, let\r\nme tell you what you can do for your country. You must, you must pass the\r\nother elements of my plan to meet our economic needs. Everyone knows\r\ninvestment speeds recovery. And I am proposing this evening a change in the\r\nalternative minimum tax, and the creation of a new 15% investment tax\r\nallowance. This will encourage businesses to accelerate investment and\r\nbring people back to work. Real estate has led our economy out of almost\r\nall the tough times we've ever had. Once building starts, carpenters and\r\nplumbers work, people buy homes and take out mortgages.\r\n\r\nMy plan would modify the passive-loss rule for active real-estate\r\ndevelopers. And it would make it easier for pension plans to purchase real\r\nestate. For those Americans who dream of buying a first home but who can't\r\nquite afford it, my plan would allow first-time home buyers to withdraw\r\nsavings from IRAs without penalty and provide a $5000 tax credit for the\r\nfirst purchase of that home.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, my immediate plan calls on Congress to give crucial help to\r\npeople who own a home, to every one who has a business, a farm or a single\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nThis time, at this hour, I cannot take \"No\" for an answer. You must cut the\r\ncapital gains tax on the people of this country. Never has an issue been so\r\ndemagogued by its opponents. But the demagogues are wrong. They are wrong,\r\nand they know it. Sixty percent of people who benefit from lower capital\r\ngains have incomes under $50,000. A cut in the capital gains tax increases\r\njobs and helps just about everyone in our country. And so I'm asking you to\r\ncut the capital gains tax to a maximum of 15.4%. And I'll tell you, I'll\r\ntell you, those of you who say, \"Oh no, someone who's comfortable may\r\nbenefit from this\" you kind of remind me of the old definition of the\r\nPuritan, who couldn't sleep at night worrying that somehow someone\r\nsomewhere was out having a good time.\r\n\r\nThe opponents of this measure and those who've authored various so-called\r\nsoak-the-rich bills that are floating around this chamber should be\r\nreminded of something: When they aim at the big guy, they usually hit the\r\nlittle guy. And maybe it's time that stopped.\r\n\r\nThis then is my short-term plan. Your part, members of Congress, requires\r\nenactment of these common-sense proposals that will have a strong effect on\r\nthe economy, without breaking the budget agreement and without raising tax\r\nrates. And while my plan is being passed and kicking in, we've got to care\r\nfor those in trouble today. I have provided for up to $4.4 billion in my\r\nbudget to extend federal unemployment benefits, and I ask for Congressional\r\naction right away. And I thank the committee--well, at last. And let's be\r\nfrank. Let's be frank; let me level with you.\r\n\r\nI know, and you know, that my plan is unveiled in a political season. I\r\nknow, and you know, that everything I propose will be viewed by some in\r\nmerely partisan terms. But I ask you to know what is in my heart. And my\r\naim is to increase our nation's good. And I'm doing what I think is right;\r\nI'm proposing what I know will help. I pride myself that I'm a prudent man,\r\nand I believe that patience is a virtue, but I understand politics is, for\r\nsome, a game and that sometimes the game is to stop all progress and then\r\ndecry the lack of improvement. But let me tell you, let me tell you, far\r\nmore important than my political future--and far more important than\r\nyours--is the well-being of our country. And members of this chamber,\r\nmembers of this chamber, are practical people, and I know you won't resent\r\nsome practical advice: When people put their party's fortunes, whatever the\r\nparty, whatever the side of this aisle, before the public good, they court\r\ndefeat not only for their country, but for themselves. And they will\r\ncertainly deserve it.\r\n\r\nAnd I submit my plan tomorrow. And I am asking you to pass it by March 20.\r\nFrom the day after that--if it must be--the battle is joined. And you\r\nknow, when principle is at stake, I relish a good fair fight.\r\n\r\nI said my plan has two parts, and it does. And it's the second part that is\r\nthe heart of the matter. For it's not enough to get an immediate burst. We\r\nneed long-term improvement in our economic position. We all know that the\r\nkey to our economic future is to insure that America continues as the\r\neconomic leader of the world. We have that in our power. Here, then, is my\r\nlong-term plan to guarantee our future.\r\n\r\nFirst, trade: We will work to break down the walls that stop world trade.\r\nWe will work to open markets everywhere. And in our major trade\r\nnegotiations, I will continue pushing to eliminate tariffs and subsidies\r\nthat damage America's farmers and workers. And we'll get more good American\r\njobs within our own hemisphere through the North American Free Trade\r\nAgreement, and through the Enterprise for the Americas Initiative. But\r\nchanges are here, and more are coming. The work place of the future will\r\ndemand more highly skilled workers than ever, people who are computer\r\nliterate, highly educated.\r\n\r\nAnd we must be the world's leader in education. And we must revolutionize\r\nAmerica's schools. My America 2000 strategy will help us reach that goal.\r\nMy plan will give parents more choice, give teachers more flexibility and\r\nhelp communities create new American schools. Thirty states across the\r\nnation have established America 2000 programs. Hundreds of cities and towns\r\nhave joined. Now Congress must join this great movement. Pass my proposals\r\nfor new American schools.\r\n\r\nThat was my second long-term proposal. And here's my third: We must make\r\ncommon-sense investments that will help us compete, long-term, in the\r\nmarketplace. We must encourage research and development. My plan is to make\r\nthe R and D tax credit permanent, and to provide record levels of support,\r\nover $76 billion this year alone for people who explore the promise of\r\nemerging technologies.\r\n\r\nAnd fourth, we must do something about crime and drugs. And it is time for\r\na major renewed investment in fighting violent street crime. Its saps our\r\nstrength and hurts our faith in our society, and in our future together.\r\nSurely a tired woman on her way to work at six in the morning on a subway\r\ndeserves the right to get there safely. And surely, it's true that everyone\r\nwho changes his or her way of life because of crime--from those afraid to\r\ngo our at night to those afraid to walk in the parks they pay for--surely\r\nthose people have been denied a basic civil right. It is time to restore\r\nit. Congress, pass my comprehensive crime bill. It is tough on criminals\r\nand supportive of police, and it has been languishing in these hallowed\r\nhalls for years now. Pass it. Help your country.\r\n\r\nAnd fifth, I ask you tonight to fund our HOPE housing proposal and to pass\r\nmy enterprise-zone legislation, which will get businesses into the inner\r\ncity. We must empower the poor with the pride that comes from owning a\r\nhome, getting a job, becoming part of things. My plan would encourage real\r\nestate construction by extending tax incentives for mortgage-revenue bonds\r\nand low-income housing. And I ask tonight for record expenditures for the\r\nprogram that helps children born into want move into excellence: Head\r\nStart.\r\n\r\nStep six: We must reform our health care system for this too, bears on\r\nwhether or not we can compete in the world. American health costs have been\r\nexploding. This year America will spend over $800 billion on health, and\r\nthat is expected to grow to $1.6 trillion by the end of the decade. We\r\nsimply cannot afford this. The cost of health care shows up not only in\r\nyour family budget, but in the price of everything we buy and everything we\r\nsell. When health coverage for a fellow on the assembly line costs\r\nthousands of dollars, the cost goes into the product he makes. And you pay\r\nthe bill. Now we must make a choice.\r\n\r\nNow some pretend we can have it both ways: they call it play or pay. But\r\nthat expensive approach is unstable. It will mean higher taxes, fewer jobs,\r\nand eventually, a system under complete government control. Really, there\r\nare only two options. And we can move toward a nationalized system, a\r\nsystem which will restrict patient choice in picking a doctor and force the\r\ngovernment to ration services arbitrarily. And what we'll get is patients\r\nin long lines, indifferent service and a huge new tax burden. Or we can\r\nreform our own private health-care system, which still gives us, for all\r\nits flaws, the best quality health care in the world. Well, let's build on\r\nour strengths.\r\n\r\nMy plan provides insurance security for all Americans while preserving and\r\nincreasing the idea of choice. We make basic health insurance affordable\r\nfor all low-income people not now covered. We do it by providing a\r\nhealth-insurance tax credit of up to $3750 for each low-income family. The\r\nmiddle class gets help, too. And by reforming the health insurance market,\r\nmy plan assures that Americans will have access to basic health insurance\r\neven if they change jobs or develop serious health problem We must bring\r\ncosts under control, preserve quality, preserve choice and reduce people's\r\nnagging daily worry about health insurance. My plan, the details of which I\r\nwill announce shortly, does just that.\r\n\r\nAnd seventh, we must get the federal deficit under control. We now have in\r\nlaw, enforcable spending caps, and a requirement that we pay for the\r\nprograms we create. There are those in Congress who would ease that\r\ndiscipline now. But I cannot let them do it. And I won't. My plan would\r\nfreeze all domestic discretionary budget authority which means \"No more\r\nnext year than this year\". I will not tamper with Social Security but I\r\nwould put real caps on the growth of uncontrolled spending. And I would\r\nalso freeze federal domestic government employment. And with the help of\r\nCongress, my plan will get rid of 246 programs that don't deserve federal\r\nfunding. Some of them have noble titles, but none of them is indispensible.\r\nWe can get rid of each and every one of them.\r\n\r\nYou know, it's time we rediscovered a home truth the American people have\r\nnever forgotten: the government is too big and spends too much. And I call\r\non Congress to adopt a measure that will help put an end to the annual\r\nritual of filling the budget with pork-barrel appropriations. Every year,\r\nthe press has a field day making fun of outrageous examples, a Lawrence\r\nWelk Museum, a research grant for Belgian Endive. We all know how these\r\nthings get into the budget, and maybe you need someone to help you say no.\r\nI know how to say it. And you know what I need to make it stick. Give me\r\nthe same thing 43 governors have--the line-item veto--and let me help\r\nyou control spending.\r\n\r\nWe must put an end to unfinanced government mandates. These are the\r\nrequirements Congress puts on our cities, counties and states without\r\nsupplying the money. And if Congress passes a mandate, it should be forced\r\nto pay for it and balance the cost with savings elsewhere. After all, a\r\nmandate just increases someone else's tax burden, and that means higher\r\ntaxes at the state and local level.\r\n\r\nStep Eight: Congress should enact the bold reform proposals that are still\r\nawaiting congressional action: bank reform, civil justice reform, tort\r\nreform, and my national energy strategy.\r\n\r\nAnd finally, we must strengthen the family, because it is the family that\r\nhas the greatest bearing on our future. When Barbara holds an AIDS baby in\r\nher arms and reads to children, she's saying to every person in this\r\ncountry, \"Family Matters\".\r\n\r\nAnd I am announcing tonight a new commission on America's urban families.\r\nI've asked Missouri's governor, John Ashcroft, to be chairman, former\r\nDallas Mayor Annetter Strauss to be co-chair. You know, I had Mayors, the\r\nleading mayors from the League of Cities, in the other day at the White\r\nHouse, and they told me something striking. They said that every one of\r\nthem, Republican and Democrat, agreed on one thing: That the major cause of\r\nthe problems of the cities is the dissolution of the family. And they asked\r\nfor this commission, and they were right to ask, because it's time to\r\ndetermine what we can do to keep families together, strong and sound.\r\n\r\nThere's one thing we can do right away: Ease the burden of rearing a child.\r\nI ask you tonight to raise the personal exemption by $500 per child for\r\nevery family. For a family with four kids, that's an increase of $2000.\r\nThis is a good start in the right direction, and it's what we can afford.\r\nIt's time to allow families to deduct the interest they pay on student\r\nloans. And I'm asking you to do just that. And I'm asking you to allow\r\npeople to use money from their IRAs to pay medical and educational\r\nexpenses, all without penalties. And I'm asking for more. Ask American\r\nparents what they dislike about how things are going in our country, and\r\nchances are good that pretty soon they'll get to welfare.\r\n\r\nAmericans are the most generous people on Earth. But we have to go back to\r\nthe insight of Franklin Roosevelt who, when he spoke of what became the\r\nwelfare program, want that it must not become a narcotic and a subtle\r\ndestroyer of the spirit. Welfare was never meant to be a life style. It was\r\nnever meant to be a habit. It was never supposed to be passed on from\r\ngeneration to generation like a legacy. It's time to replace the\r\nassumptions of the welfare state and help reform the welfare system.\r\n\r\nStates throughout the country are beginning to operate with new\r\nassumptions: that when able-bodied people receive government assistance\r\nthey have responsibilities to the taxpayer. A responsibility to seek work,\r\neducation, or job training. A responsibility to get their lives in order. A\r\nresponsibility to hold their families together and refrain from having\r\nchildren out of wedlock. And a responsibility to obey the law. We are going\r\nto help this movement. Often, state reform requires waiving certain federal\r\nregulations. I will act to make that process easier and quicker for every\r\nstate that asks our help. And I want to add, as we make these changes, we\r\nwork together to improve this system, that our intention is not\r\nscapegoating and finger-pointing. If you read the papers or watch TV you\r\nknow there's been a rise these days in a certain kind of ugliness: racist\r\ncomments, anti-Semitism, an increased sense of division. Really, this is\r\nnot us. This is not who we are. And this is not acceptable.\r\n\r\nAnd so you have my plan for America. And I am asking for big things, but I\r\nbelieve in my heart you will do what's right.\r\n\r\nAnd you know, it's kind of an American tradition to show a certain\r\nskepticism toward our democratic institutions. I myself have sometimes\r\nthought the aging process could be delayed if it had to make its way\r\nthrough Congress. But you will deliberate, and you will discuss, and that\r\nis fine. But my friends the people cannot wait. They need help now. And\r\nthere's a mood among us. People are worried. There has been talk of\r\ndecline. Someone even said our workers are lazy and uninspired. And I\r\nthought, \"Really? Go tell Neil Armstrong standing on the moon. Tell the\r\nAmerican farmer who feeds his country and the world. Tell the men and women\r\nof Desert Storm.\" Moods come and go, but greatness endures. Our does.\r\n\r\nAnd maybe for a moment it's good to remember what, in the dailyness of our\r\nlives, we forget. We are still and ever the freest nation on Earth, the\r\nkindest nation on Earth, the strongest nation on Earth. And we have always\r\nrisen to the occasion. And we are going to lift this nation out of hard\r\ntimes inch by inch and day by day, and those who would stop us better step\r\naside. Because I look at hard times and I make this vow: This will not\r\nstand. And so we move on, together, a rising nation, the once and future\r\nmiracle that is still, this night, the hope of the world.",
