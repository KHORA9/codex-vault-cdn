In the cases of those selected it will be\r\nseen that the fierce contention has commonly involved the sacrifice of\r\nconjugal happiness, the welfare of children, domestic peace, reputation,\r\nand all the amenities of the gentle life.\r\n\r\nThat clever women abound in the present day we have undeniable\r\nproof--many as clever, no doubt, as that famous philosopheress Madame du\r\nChatelet, who managed at one and the same moment the thread of an\r\nintrigue, her cards at piquet, and a calculation in algebra, but who may\r\nstill lack the qualifications indispensably necessary to make clever\r\npoliticians. Perhaps, therefore, we might be allowed to suggest that it\r\nwould be well for ladies who are ambitious of figuring in either or both\r\nspheres that politics and diplomacy are special and laborious pursuits,\r\ninvolving a great deal of knowledge as difficult, and in the first\r\ninstance as repulsive, to acquire as Greek or chemistry. Yet, fully\r\nadmitting their capacity to qualify themselves intellectually, and\r\nsupposing them to attain the summit of their ambition of figuring\r\nsuccessfully in public life, a grave question still arises--would they\r\nthereby increase or diminish their present great social influence? They\r\nhave now more influence of a certain kind than men have; but if they\r\nobtain the influence of men, they cannot expect to retain the influence\r\nof women. Nature, it may be thought, has established a fair distribution\r\nof power between the two sexes. Women are potent in one sphere, and men\r\nin another; and, if they are conscious of the domestic sway they already\r\nexercise, they will not imperil it by challenging dominion in a field in\r\nwhich they would be less secure.\r\n\r\nRoot and bond of the family, woman is no less a stranger by her natural\r\naptitudes than by her domestic ministrations to the general interests of\r\nsociety; the conduct of the latter demands, in fact, a disengagement of\r\nheart and mind to which she can only attain by transforming herself, to\r\nthe detriment of her duties and of her true influence. Ever to\r\nsubordinate persons to things, never to overstep in her efforts the\r\nstrict measure of the possible--those two conditions of the political\r\nlife are repugnant to her ardent and devoted nature. Even amongst women\r\nin whom those gifts are met with in the highest degree, clearness of\r\nperception has been almost always obscured by the ardour of pursuit or\r\nthat of patronage--by the irresistible desire of pushing to the\r\nextremity of success her own ideas, and especially those of her friends.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us imagine political life to resemble a great game at cards,\r\nthe rules of which have been settled beforehand, and the winnings\r\ndevoted to the use of the greatest number; well, a woman ought never to\r\ntake a hand in it. Her place should be at the player's elbow, to warn\r\nand advise him, to point out an unperceived chance, to share in his\r\nsuccess, more than all to console him, should luck run against him.\r\nThus, whilst all her better qualities would be brought into play, all\r\nher weaker would not in any wise be at stake.\r\n\r\nWe would put it, therefore, to the womanly conscience--Is it not a\r\nhundred times more honourable to exercise, so to speak, rights that are\r\nlegitimately recognised, though wisely limited, than to suffer in\r\nconsideration, and often in reputation, from an usurpation always\r\ncertain of being disputed?\r\n\r\nIt has been the author's endeavour to show the truth of these\r\nconclusions by tracing the political career of certain well-born and\r\nsingularly-gifted women--women whose lofty courage, strength of mind,\r\nkeen introspection, political zeal, and genius for intrigue enabled them\r\nto baffle and make head against some of the greatest political male\r\ncelebrities of modern history, without, however, winning us over to\r\ntheir opinions or their cause; women who, in some instances, after\r\npassing the best period of their lives in political strife, in\r\nfostering civil war, in hatching perilous plots, and who, having cast\r\nfortune and all the \"gentle life\" to the winds, preferred exile to\r\nsubmission, or to wage a struggle as fruitless as it was unceasing;\r\nuntil having arrived at the tardy conviction of its futility, and that\r\nthey had devoted their existence to the pursuit of the illusory and the\r\nchimerical, they found at length repose and tranquillity only in\r\nsolitude and repentance.\r\n\r\nIn the stirring careers of certain among these remarkable personages, it\r\nwill be seen that the mainspring of their political zeal was either the\r\nfierce excitement of an overmastering passion, an irresistible\r\nproclivity to gallantry, or an absorbing ambition, rather than any\r\npatriotic motive. This may go far to explain the singular sagacity,\r\nfinesse, and energy displayed in their devotion to what otherwise\r\nappears alike mischievous and chimerical by those three high-born and\r\nsplendidly-gifted women who figured so conspicuously in the civil war of\r\nthe Fronde; and, though so much self-abnegation, courage, constancy, and\r\nheroism, well or ill displayed, may obtain some share of pardon for\r\nerrors it would be wrong to palliate or condone, their example, it is to\r\nbe hoped, will prove deterrent rather than contagious. La\r\nRochefoucauld--a moralist, though by no means a moral man--who well knew\r\nthe sex, had seen at work these political women of the time of the\r\nFronde. That opportunity does not appear to have inspired him with an\r\nunbounded admiration for them from that point of view.\r\n\r\nOf the peril and mischief that fair trio inflicted upon Anne of\r\nAustria's great Prime Minister and the State he governed we have an\r\ninteresting personal record. When, in 1660, Mazarin's policy, triumphant\r\non every side, had added the treaty of the Pyrenees to that of\r\nWestphalia, the honour of the conclusion of the protracted conference\r\nheld at the _Isle of Pheasants_ was reserved for the chief Ministers of\r\nthe two Crowns--the Cardinal and Don Louis de Haro. The latter\r\ncongratulated his brother premier on the well-earned repose he was about\r\nto enjoy, after such a long and arduous struggle. The Cardinal replied\r\nthat he could not promise himself any repose in France, for there, he\r\nsaid, the _female_ politicians were more to be dreaded than the _male_;\r\nand he complained bitterly of the torments he had undergone at the hands\r\nof certain political women of the Fronde--notably the Duchess de\r\nLongueville, the Duchess de Chevreuse, and the Princess Palatine, each\r\nof whom, he asserted, was capable of upsetting three kingdoms.\r\n\r\n\"You are very lucky here in Spain,\" he added. \"You have, as everywhere\r\nelse, two kinds of women--coquettes in abundance, and a very few\r\nsimple-minded domestic women. The former care only to please their\r\nlovers, the latter their husbands. Neither the one nor the other,\r\nhowever, have any ambition beyond indulging themselves in vanities and\r\nluxuries. They only employ their pens in scribbling billet-doux or\r\nlove-confessions, neither one nor other bother their brains as to how\r\nthe grain grows, whilst talking about business makes their heads ache.\r\nOur women, on the contrary, whether prudes or flirts, old or young,\r\nstupid or clever, will intermeddle with everything. No honest woman,\" to\r\nuse the Cardinal's own words, \"would permit her spouse to go to sleep,\r\nno coquette allow her lover any favour, ere she had heard all the\r\npolitical news of the day. They will see all that goes on, will know\r\neverything, and--what is worse--have a finger in everything, and set\r\neverything in confusion. We have a trio, among others\"--and he again\r\nnamed the three fair factionists above mentioned--\"who threw us all\r\ndaily into more confusion than was ever known in Babel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank heaven!\" replied Don Louis, somewhat ungallantly, \"our women\r\n_are_ of the disposition seemingly so well known to you. Provided that\r\nthey can finger the cash, whether of their husbands or their lovers,\r\nthey are satisfied; and I am very glad to say that they do not meddle\r\nwith politics, for if they did they would assuredly embroil everything\r\nin Spain as they do in France.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during the minority of Louis XIV. that Mazarin had but too good\r\ncause to complain of the three clever and fascinating women he thus\r\nnamed to Don Louis de Haro, who through their political factions,\r\nintrigues, and gallantries gave Anne of Austria's Minister no rest, and\r\nfor a long period not only thwarted and opposed him, but at intervals\r\nplaced the State, and even his life, in imminent jeopardy.\r\n\r\nFortunately, in our political history the instances are rare of women\r\nwho have quitted the sphere of domesticity and private life to take an\r\nactive part in the affairs of State. We say \"fortunately;\" for in our\r\nopinion such abstention has tended to the happiness of both sexes in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nIn French memoirs, politics and scandal, the jokes of the _salons_ and\r\nthe councils of the Cabinet are inextricably mixed up together, and\r\nreveal a political system in which the authority exercised under free\r\ninstitutions by men had been transferred to the art, the tact, and the\r\naccomplishments of the female sex. We therein see how much women have\r\ndone by those subtle agencies. If France was a despotism tempered by\r\nepigrams, it was the life of the _salons_ which brought those epigrams\r\nto perfection; and the _salons_ thus constituted a sort of social\r\nparliament, which, though unable to stop the supplies or withhold the\r\nMutiny Act, still possessed a formidable weapon of offence in the power\r\nof making the Government ridiculous. Such was the difference existing\r\nbetween two quite distinct modes of government; between Parliamentary\r\ngovernment and closet government; between the mace of the House of\r\nCommons and the fan of the Duchess de Longueville. England, as we need\r\nhardly say, has never had a government of this description. The nearest\r\napproach to it which she has ever seen was under the sway of Charles the\r\nSecond, and, accordingly, the nearest approach to French memoirs which\r\nour literature possesses is in the volumes of Pepys and Hamilton. To the\r\nalmost universal exemption of Englishwomen from taking an overt part in\r\npolitical affairs a striking exception must be made in Sarah, Duchess of\r\nMarlborough. She is the strongest example, perhaps, in the history of\r\nthe world--certainly in the history of this empire--of the abuse of\r\nfemale favouritism, and the most flagrant instance of household\r\nfamiliarity on the destinies of mankind. Sarah Jennings, the political\r\nheroine of her age, and Viceroy, as she was called, in England, had,\r\nhowever, for contemporaries two other remarkable women, who touched the\r\nsprings of political machinery quite as powerfully as--if not more\r\npowerfully than, save herself, any to be found within the limits of\r\nEurope--Madame de Maintenon and the Princess des Ursins. In the\r\nrespective careers of that other formidable trio of female politicians\r\nmay be traced the important, the overwhelming, influence, which female\r\nMinisters, under the title of Court ladies, had obtained over the\r\ndestinies of England, France, and Spain. At that momentous period--the\r\ncommencement of the eighteenth century--the memoirs of a _bed-chamber\r\nlady_ constitute the history of Europe. The bed-chamber woman soon\r\nbecame the pivot of the political world. The influence of Mrs. Masham\r\nfirst endangered and finally overthrew the power of the great Duke of\r\nMarlborough. Some of the characteristics of the reign of Charles the\r\nSecond reappeared partially and in a very unattractive form under the\r\ntwo first Georges, and have served to impart a tinge of French colour to\r\nthe memoirs which describe their Courts. But, fortunately for England,\r\nneither Walpole nor his royal master were men of refined taste. It would\r\nhave been hard for a monarch like Charles the Second, or a minister like\r\nLord Bolingbroke, to resist the charms of those beautiful and sprightly\r\ngirls who sparkle like diamonds in all the memoirs of that time. Their\r\npolitical influence was but small. George the First and his successor\r\npursued their unwieldy loves and enjoyed their boorish romps in a style\r\nnot seductive to English gentlemen. Politics were surrendered to\r\nWalpole; and the consequence was that, although there was plenty of\r\nimmorality under those gracious Sovereigns, yet the feminine element of\r\nCourt life had no longer that connection with _public policy_ which once\r\nfor a brief space it had possessed; and the resemblance to French\r\nmanners in this respect grew less and less, till it disappeared\r\naltogether with the accession of George the Third.\r\n\r\nDuring the reign of that domesticated paterfamilias a slight exception,\r\nit is true, occurred in the instance of Georgina Spencer, Duchess of\r\nDevonshire. Young, beautiful, amiable, and witty, and not altogether\r\nfree from coquetry, she reckoned amongst her admirers some of the most\r\ndistinguished men of that day. She fascinated them all without\r\nencouraging the pretensions of any; and notwithstanding the jealousy\r\nwhich so great a superiority necessarily excited among her own sex, and\r\ndespite the rancour to which the inutility of their efforts to please\r\nher gave birth in the bosoms of certain of the men, she preserved a\r\nreputation for discretion beyond all suspicion. One circumstance of her\r\nlife might indeed have cast a slur upon her fair fame if her\r\nirreproachable conduct, added to her natural graces, had not condoned a\r\nspecies of notoriety which opinion in England very generally reproves.\r\nThe Duchess of Devonshire had friendly relations with the celebrated\r\nCharles James Fox, and that friendship had taken the tinge of party\r\nspirit. Fox presented himself as a candidate to represent Westminster in\r\nParliament. He had two very formidable opponents, and it was thought\r\nthat he would have succumbed in the struggle had not several amiable and\r\nenergetic women made extraordinary efforts to procure him votes. At the\r\nhead of these fair solicitors was the Duchess of Devonshire. A butcher\r\nwhose vote she requested promised it to her on the condition that he\r\nmight give her a kiss. To this she cheerfully consented, and that kiss\r\nadded one more vote to her friend's poll. Such familiarity was far less\r\nshocking to our English manners than the too active and public part\r\ntaken by a lady of distinction in politics. Very few of her countrywomen\r\nbefore her time had given occasion for a like scandal.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] An anecdote of her has been preserved which proves how very\r\n    general was the impression the grace and beauty of the Duchess of\r\n    Devonshire made upon men in every station of society. On one\r\n    occasion of her being present on the racecourse at Newmarket, a\r\n    burly farmer who stood near her carriage, after having for some time\r\n    gazed at her in a species of ecstasy, exclaimed aloud, \"Ah! why am I\r\n    not God Almighty?--she should then be Queen of Heaven!\" The Duchess\r\n    preserved her personal charms far beyond the period of life when\r\n    they commonly disappear among women, though she lost one of her eyes\r\n    a few years before her death in 1806.\r\n\r\nThe existence of those literary assemblies in France during the\r\neighteenth century, the most important of which were those presided\r\nover by Madame du Deffand, Mdlle. de Lespinasse, and Madame Geoffrin,\r\nwere a characteristic feature of the time. It is a notable fact that the\r\nabstention from politics in those assemblies indirectly tended to\r\nincrease the power and importance of the women who frequented them.\r\nAlluding to their influence, Montesquieu caustically remarked that a\r\nnation where women give the prevailing tone must necessarily be\r\ntalkative. Then, however, it was the men who talked and the women who\r\nlistened. The men talked because they could do little else; women gave\r\nthe prevailing tone because men of all classes were partly compelled,\r\nand partly willing, to gather around them. The nobles being excluded\r\nfrom politics--in which none but the Ministers and their creatures could\r\ninterfere--exercising no control either as individuals or as a body,\r\nnaturally gave themselves up to the pleasures of society. Their\r\npolitical insignificance thus increased the power and importance of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nTo a far greater degree was their power and importance increased, on the\r\ncontrary, during the first decade of the French Revolution, when, from\r\nthe exceptional position they held, the _salons_ of Madame Roland,\r\nMadame Necker, Madame de Suard, and others were essentially\r\npolitical--that of Madame Roland being almost an echo of the Legislative\r\nAssembly. But women who love freedom abstractedly for its own sake, and\r\nare ready to suffer and die for a political principle, like Madame\r\nRoland, are very rarely met with.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the century the female leaders of the hitherto\r\nliterary and social _salons_ were so irresistibly swept into the\r\nwhirlpool of public questions and events that they for the most part\r\ninvoluntarily became mere political partisans. Among others, but with a\r\nconsiderable modification on the score of the literary element, may be\r\ninstanced Madame de Stael, who by descent, education, and natural bias\r\nwas inevitably destined to aim at political power. The extent and\r\nprominence of that exercised by her must have been considerable, though\r\ncertainly overrated by Napoleon, in whom, however, it excited such\r\nunreasonable apprehension as led him to inflict ten years' banishment\r\nfrom France upon the talented daughter of Necker.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred that we desire to reduce women to the condition\r\nof a humiliating inaction. Far from it. In the position we would place\r\nthem they could never feel, think, or act with greater interest or\r\nvivacity. Whilst it is desirable that every kind of artifice or intrigue\r\nshould be interdicted from the interior of their domesticity, it is\r\nquite permissible for them to watch attentively important matters that\r\nmay be occurring in public life. To that function they may bring their\r\ncare and their solicitude, in order to follow and second continually the\r\ncompanion of their existence. \"Les hommes meme,\" says Fenelon, \"qui ont\r\ntoute l'autorite en public, ne peuvent par leurs deliberations etablir\r\naucun bien effectif, si les femmes ne leur aident a l'executer.\" Such\r\nwas the legitimate influence exercised by the Princess Esterhazy, Ladies\r\nHolland, Palmerston, and Beaconsfield, in our day. It is no secret that\r\nthe late lamented Viscountess Beaconsfield took the deepest interest in\r\nevery great movement in which her illustrious husband was engaged. Such,\r\ntoo, was the case with Lady Palmerston, in reference to the great\r\nstatesman whose name she bore. The influence of women in the politics of\r\nrecent days is something peculiar and new. Our time has seen many women\r\nwhose share in the politics of men was frank, unconcealed, and\r\nlegitimate, while yet it never pretended or sought to be anything more\r\nthan an influence--never attempted to be a ruling spirit. By following\r\nthese examples, the women of England may make their power felt, without\r\ndemanding to be put upon the same footing as their husbands.\r\n\r\nWoman's reign, it has been truly said, \"is almost absolute within the\r\nfour walls of a drawing-room.\" It is undisputed in family direction and\r\nin the management of children; but the cases are rare indeed where it\r\nextends to _public questions_ of any kind. The Frenchwoman of the\r\npresent day is essentially a woman. Her objects are almost always\r\nfeminine; she does not seek to go beyond her sphere; she understands her\r\nmission as one of duty in her house and of attraction towards the world;\r\nshe is generally very ignorant of politics and all dry subjects, and\r\nshrinks from any active part in their discussion. Of course there are\r\nexceptions by the thousand; but the rule is that she voluntarily\r\nabstains from interference in outside topics, whatever be their gravity\r\nor their importance. She may have a vague opinion on such matters,\r\npicked up from hearing men talk around her, but the bent of her nature\r\nleads her in other ways--her tendency is towards things which satisfy\r\nher as a woman. It naturally follows that men do not give her what she\r\ndoes not seem to want. They consult her on matters of mutual interest,\r\nthey ask for and often follow her advice in business; but in nine cases\r\nout of ten no husband would allow his wife to tell him how to vote at an\r\nelection, or what form of government to support. This distinction is\r\ninfinitely more remarkable in France than any analogous condition would\r\nbe in England, because of the existence there of several rivals to the\r\nthrone, and the consequent splitting up of the entire nation into\r\nadherents of each pretender. Yet even this exceptional position does not\r\ninduce Frenchwomen to become politicians. Some few of them, of course,\r\nare so, and fling themselves with ardour into the cause they have\r\nadopted; but, fortunately for the tranquillity of their homes, the\r\ngreater part of them have wisdom enough to comprehend that their real\r\nfunctions on the earth are of another kind.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the champions of the enfranchisement of the sex have\r\nloudly protested against the hackneyed truisms, formerly so rife, which\r\nimpute to women every imaginable form of silliness and frivolity; that\r\nthey, like Alphonse Karr's typical woman, have nothing to do but\r\n\"_s'habiller, babiller et se deshabiller_.\" But it will be well to\r\nremember the existence of another class of maxims of even greater\r\nweight, which dwell on the subtle influence of women, and of its\r\nillimitable consequences. \"If the nose of Cleopatra,\" remarks the most\r\nfamous of these aphorists--Pascal--\"had been a hair's-breadth longer,\r\nthe fortunes of the world would have been altered.\" Has the influence of\r\nthe sex decreased since the days of the dusky beauty whose irresistible\r\nfascinations\r\n\r\n    \"----lost a world, and bade a hero fly?\"\r\n\r\nRather, is it not infinitely more subtle, wider, and more prevailing\r\nthan ever? No one who recognises the skill with which that immense\r\ninfluence may be exercised can listen without astonishment to the flimsy\r\narguments which are usually advanced in support of the question of the\r\npolitical enfranchisement of the sex. That the results of giving this\r\nparticular form of ability--a power which is irresistible to the highest\r\nintellectual refinement--the political arena for its field have not only\r\nproved widely injurious to women who have so exercised it, but to those\r\nmost closely connected with them, it has been the author's object to\r\nshow.\r\n\r\n\"And what hope of permanent success,\" it has been cogently asked, \"could\r\nwomen have if they were to enter into competition with men in callings\r\nconsidered peculiarly masculine, many of which are already overstocked?\"\r\nWe are also brought here again face to face with that evil--the\r\nlessening or the complete loss of womanly grace and purity. Take away\r\nthat reverential regard which men now feel for them, leave them to win\r\ntheir way by sheer strength of body or mind, and the result is not\r\ndifficult to conjecture. Let the condition of women in savage life tell.\r\nTowards something like this, although in civilised society not so\r\ncoarsely and roughly exposed to view, matters would tend if these\r\nagitators for women's rights were successful. Husbands, brothers, sons,\r\nhave too keen a sense of what they owe of good to their female relatives\r\nto risk its loss; or to exchange the gentleness, purity, and refinement\r\nof their homes for boldness, flippancy, hardness and knowledge of evil.\r\n\r\nNature, herself, then, has disqualified women from fighting and from\r\nentering into the fierce contentions of the prickly and crooked ways of\r\npolitics. There is a silent and beautiful education which Heaven\r\nintended that all alike should learn from mothers, sisters, and wives.\r\nEach home was meant to have in their gentler presence a softening and\r\nrefining element, so that strength should train itself to be submissive,\r\nrudeness should become abashed, and coarse passions held in check by the\r\nnatural influence of women. High or low, educated or uneducated, there\r\nis the proper work of the weaker sex. And, finally, we venture to\r\naddress her in the words of Lord Lyttelton:--\r\n\r\n    \"Seek to be good, but aim not to be great;\r\n      A woman's noblest station is retreat;\r\n      Her fairest virtues fly from public sight;\r\n      Domestic worth--that shuns too strong a light.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK I.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  ANNE DE BOURBON,\r\n  SISTER OF THE GREAT CONDE, AFTERWARDS DUCHESS DE LONGUEVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE brilliant heroine of the Fronde, of whose grace, beauty, and\r\ninfluence Anne of Austria was so jealous--not to speak of the mortal\r\nrivalry of the gay Duchesses de Montbazon and de Chatillon--although the\r\nyoungest of that famous trio whom Mazarin found so formidable in the\r\narena of politics, obviously claims alike from her exalted rank and the\r\nmemorable part she played in the tragi-comedy of the Fronde, priority of\r\nnotice among the bevy of the Cardinal's fair political opponents.\r\n\r\nSome time in the month of August, 1619, Anne Genevieve de Bourbon-Conde\r\nfirst saw the light in the donjon of Vincennes, where her parents had\r\nbeen kept State prisoners for three years previously. She was the eldest\r\nof the three children of Henry (II.) de Bourbon-Conde, first prince of\r\nthe blood, and of that Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, \"the beauty,\r\nperfect grace and majesty of her time.\"[1] The lovely Montmorency on\r\ncoming to Court in her fifteenth year had sorely troubled the heart of\r\nthe amorous soldier-king, Henry of Navarre, who had married her in 1609\r\nto his nephew of Conde with the covert hope of finding him an\r\naccommodating husband; but the latter, alike defiant and uxorious, made\r\nthe jovial Bearnois plainly understand that he had wedded the blooming\r\nCharlotte exclusively for himself. The _gaillard_ monarch, however, at\r\nlength grew so deeply enamoured that the prince, perceiving there was\r\ntoo much cause to fear the result of the constant assiduities of his\r\nroyal uncle, fled precipitately with his young wife from France, only to\r\nreturn thither after tidings reached him of the great Henry's\r\nassassination. To the fair Montmorency's very decided proclivity to\r\ngallantry was to be attributed--if we may believe the scandal-loving\r\nTallemant des Reaux--her long confinement, by the Regent Marie de'\r\nMedici's consent, within the gloomy fortress of Vincennes, rather than\r\nany reason of State for her sharing her husband's imprisonment. In fact,\r\nit was believed that the jealous prince procured her incarceration\r\nsimply to keep her out of harm's way.\r\n\r\n    [1] Lenet.\r\n\r\nDeriving from her mother the threefold gifts of grace, beauty, and\r\nmajesty, the fair Bourbon inherited also, it must be owned, a share of\r\nthat princess's inclination to _l'honnete galanterie_. The restriction\r\nto a _share_ should be noted; for at no period of her heydey, not even\r\nduring the licence of the Fronde, could Anne Genevieve be accused of\r\nhaving--as Madame de Motteville tells us the Princess de Conde\r\nhad,--adorers \"in every rank and condition of life, from popes, kings,\r\nprinces, cardinals, dukes, and marshals of France, down to simple\r\ngentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nThe mind and heart, however, of Anne de Bourbon, although predestined,\r\nalas! eventually to culpable passion, seemed at first but little\r\ninclined to the gay world--with all its blandishments and seductions,\r\nor even to its innocent pleasures. When quite a child she was in the\r\nhabit of accompanying her mother in her visits to the convent of the\r\nCarmelites at Paris. For though still possessing great personal\r\nattractions, Madame de Conde had become serious and of a somewhat\r\ndemonstrative piety. Those visits, which were frequent, strengthened\r\nAnne's gentle and susceptible mind in its tendency to devotion. The\r\nimpression, too, which somewhat later the tragic fate of her uncle, the\r\nunfortunate Duke de Montmorency,[2] left on her memory, inspired her\r\nwith the resolution to quit the outer world at the earliest possible\r\nmoment, and, renouncing all its pomps and grandeurs, hide beneath the\r\nveil her budding attractions. Although her mother opposed an inflexible\r\nresistance to her embracing that holy vocation, and strove to combat by\r\nforcible arguments the cold and disdainful demeanour exhibited by her\r\ndaughter when mixing in gay society, the fair girl persevered from the\r\nage of thirteen to seventeen in her longing to embrace the life of the\r\ncloister. Futile for a time were the parental arguments, unfruitful\r\nevery effort! Anne Genevieve would not consort with worldlings,\r\npersisted in her distaste for mundane pleasures, and continued to\r\ncherish persistently her desire for conventual seclusion. At length the\r\nprincess, in 1636, having resolved upon the adoption of more energetic\r\nmeasures, suddenly ordered her daughter to make preparations for\r\nappearing at a Court ball, and that, too, in three days. With what\r\ndespair did the young princess hear the cruel sentence! What affliction,\r\ntoo, befell the Carmelite nuns when they heard of the fatal mandate.\r\nWhat a flood of sighs and tears and prayers! The good sisters gathered\r\nthemselves together to take counsel one with another, and decided that,\r\nsince Mdlle. de Bourbon could not avoid the wretched fate that awaited\r\nher, before going through the trying ordeal she should indue her lovely\r\nform with an undergarment of hair-cloth (commonly called a _cilice_),\r\nand, protected by such armour of proof, she might then fearlessly submit\r\nherself to all the temptations lurking beneath the ensnaring vanities of\r\nher Court attire. The _cilice_, however, did not, it seems, prove\r\ninvulnerable as the aegis of Minerva, for the subtle shafts winged by\r\nhomage and admiration pierced through that slight breast-plate to a\r\nheart which in truth was by nature framed to inspire and welcome both.\r\nThe Princess de Conde rejoiced greatly at her daughter's conversion to\r\nmore reasonable views of mundane existence. The commencement of her\r\nnoviciate was no longer thought of, and her visits to the Carmelites\r\nbecame sufficiently rare. But it was only a deferment of that calm\r\nvocation, it being Anne de Bourbon's destiny to embrace it at the close\r\nof her feverish political career.\r\n\r\n    [2] Brought to the scaffold by Richelieu in 1632.\r\n\r\nThis era of her entrance into the great world was probably the happiest,\r\nthe most joyous of the fair Bourbon's life. Lofty distinction of birth,\r\ngreat personal beauty, and rare mental fascination, contributed to place\r\nher in the very foremost rank of the Court circle--in the \"height of\r\ncompany\"--conspicuous amongst lovely dames and distinguished men of the\r\ntime. Her peerless loveliness at once meeting with universal\r\nrecognition, \"la belle Conde\" was toasted with acclamation by courtiers,\r\nyoung and old--at Chantilly, at Liancourt, at the Louvre, and at the\r\nHotel de Rambouillet. Contemporaries of either sex have rendered\r\nunanimous testimony to the varied and exceptional character of her\r\nattractions, and we will let a woman's pen add to Petitot's pencilling\r\nsome of those delicate traits which neither the burin nor even the vivid\r\ntints of the enamel have the power to convey.\r\n\r\n\"Her beauty,\" says Mdme. de Motteville, \"consisted more in the\r\nbrilliance of her complexion\"--(\"it had the blush of the pearl,\" writes\r\nanother contemporary)--\"than in perfection of feature. Her eyes were not\r\nlarge, but bright, and finely cut, and of a blue so lovely it resembled\r\nthat of the turquoise. The poets could only apply the trite comparison\r\nof lilies and roses to the carnation which mantled on her cheek, whilst\r\nher fair, silken, luxuriant tresses, and the peculiar limpidity of her\r\nglance, added to many other charms, made her more like an angel--so far\r\nas our imperfect nature allows of our imagining such a being--than a\r\nmere woman.\" Somewhat later, the smallpox, in robbing her of the bloom\r\nof her beauty, still left her all its brilliancy, to repeat the remark\r\nof that eminent connoisseur of female loveliness, Cardinal de Retz.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the general opinion of her contemporaries: Mdlle. de Bourbon\r\nrather charmed by the very peculiar style of her countenance than by its\r\nlinear regularity. One of her greatest fascinations lay in an\r\nindescribable languor, both of mind and manner--\"a languor interrupted\r\nat intervals,\" says De Retz, \"by a sort of luminous awakenings, as\r\nsurprising as they were delightful. This physical and intellectual\r\nindolence presented later in life a piquant contrast to her\r\nthen\"--according to Mdme. de Motteville--\"somewhat too passionate\r\ntemperament.\" She was of good height, and altogether of an admirable\r\nform. It is evident also, from the authentic portraits of her still\r\nextant, that she had that kind of attraction so much prized during the\r\nseventeenth century, and which, with beautiful hands, had made the\r\nreputation of Anne of Austria. In speech, we are told, she was very\r\ngentle. Her gestures, with the expression of her countenance, and the\r\nsound of her voice, produced the most perfect music. But her peculiar\r\ncharm consisted in a graceful ease--a languor, as all her contemporaries\r\nexpressed it--which would quickly change to the highest degree of\r\nanimation when stirred by emotion, but which usually gave her an air of\r\nindolence and aristocratic _nonchalance_, sometimes mistaken for\r\n_ennui_, sometimes for disdain.\r\n\r\nCrediting the unvarying testimony of these and other of her\r\ncontemporaries, the daughter of Bourbon-Conde must have been at least as\r\nbeautiful as her mother--endowed, indeed, with almost every attribute\r\nand feature of female loveliness.\r\n\r\n\"Beauty,\" remarks a philosophic panegyrist of physical perfection,\r\n\"extends its prestige to posterity itself, and attaches a charm for\r\ncenturies to the name alone of the privileged creatures upon whom it has\r\npleased heaven to bestow it.\" Beauty has also its epochs. It does not\r\nbelong to all men and to all ages to enjoy it in its exquisite\r\nperfection. As there are fashions which spoil it, so there are periods\r\nwhich affect its sentiment. For instance, it belonged to the eighteenth\r\ncentury to invent _pretty_ women--charming dolls--all powder, patches,\r\nand perfume, affecting the attractions which they did not possess under\r\ntheir vast hoops and great furbelows. Let us venture to say that the\r\nfoundation of true beauty, as of true virtue, as of true genius, is\r\nstrength. Shed over this strength the vivifying rays of elegance, grace,\r\ndelicacy, and you have beauty. Its perfect type is the Venus of\r\nMilo,[3] or again, that pure and mysterious apparition, goddess or\r\nmortal, which is called Psyche, or the Venus of Naples.[4] Beauty is\r\ncertainly to be seen in the Venus de' Medici, but in that type we feel\r\nthat it is declining, or about to decline. Look at, not the women of\r\nTitian, but the virgins of Raphael and Leonardo: the face is of infinite\r\ndelicacy, but the body evinces strength. These forms ought to disgust\r\none for ever with the shadows and monkeys _a la Pompadour_. Let us adore\r\ngrace, but not separate it in everything too much from strength, for\r\nwithout strength grace soon shares the fate of the flower that is\r\nseparated from the stem which vitalizes and sustains it.\r\n\r\n    [3] Quatremere de Quincy, Dissertation upon the Antique Statue of\r\n    Venus Discovered in the Island of Milo. 1836.\r\n\r\n    [4] Millingen: Ancient Inedited Monuments. Fol. 1826.\r\n\r\nWhat a train of accomplished women this seventeenth century presents to\r\nus! They were not all politicians. Women who were loaded with\r\nadmiration, drawing after them all hearts, and spreading from rank to\r\nrank that worship of beauty which throughout Europe received the name of\r\nFrench gallantry. In France they accompany this great century in its too\r\nrapid course; they mark its principal epochs, beginning with Charlotte\r\nde Montmorency and ending with Mdme. de Montespan. The Duchess de\r\nLongueville has perhaps the most prominent place in that dazzling\r\ngallery of lovely women, having all the characteristics of true beauty,\r\nand joining to it a charm exclusively her own.\r\n\r\nIn early girlhood she had been taken, along with her elder brother, the\r\nDuke d'Enghien, to the Hotel de Rambouillet; and the _salons_ of the Rue\r\nSt. Thomas du Louvre were probably the most fitting school for such a\r\nmind as hers, in which grandeur and finesse were almost equally\r\nblended--a grandeur allied to the romantic, and associated with a\r\nfinesse frequently merging into subtilty, as indeed may be discerned in\r\nCorneille himself, the most perfect mental representative of that\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nTo follow step by step the course of Anne de Bourbon's life at this\r\nperiod of it through all its earliest rivalries, would involve the task\r\nof recording the manifold caprices of a tender, yet ambitious nature, in\r\nwhich the mind and heart were unceasingly dupes of each other. It would\r\nbe like an attempt to follow the devious path of the light foam and\r\nlaughing sparkle of the billow--\r\n\r\n    \"In vento et rapida scribere oportet aqua.\"\r\n\r\nOur purpose lies mainly with her political life, but ere entering upon\r\nit we will give a short but comprehensive view of her character in the\r\nwords of one who, more than anybody else, had the means of judging her\r\ncorrectly--La Rochefoucauld. \"This Princess,\" writes the Duke,\r\n\"possessed all the charms of mind, united to personal beauty, to so high\r\na degree, that it seemed as though nature had taken pleasure in forming\r\nin her person a perfectly finished work. But those fine qualities were\r\nrendered less brilliant through a blemish rarely seen in one so highly\r\nendowed, which was that, far from giving the law to those who had a\r\nparticular admiration for her, she transfused herself so thoroughly into\r\ntheir sentiments that she no longer recognised her own.\"\r\n\r\nNow La Rochefoucauld should have been the last person to complain of\r\nthat defect, since he was the first to foster it in the Duchess. In her\r\nbosom love awoke ambition, but the awakening was so sudden, in fact,\r\nthat any difference in the two passions was never perceptible.\r\n\r\nSingular contradiction! The more we contemplate the political bias of\r\nMadame de Longueville the more it becomes mingled with her amorous\r\ncaprice; but when we analyse her love more narrowly (and later on in\r\nlife she herself made the avowal), it appears nothing else than ambition\r\ntravestied--a desire to shine only the more magnificently brilliant.\r\n\r\nHer character, then, was entirely wanting in consistency, in self-will;\r\nand her mind, be it observed, however brilliant and acute, had nothing\r\nthat was calculated to counterbalance that defect of character. One may\r\npossess the faculty of right perception without strength of mind to do\r\nthat which is right. One may be rational in mind and the contrary in\r\nconduct--character being at fault between the two. But here the case was\r\ndifferent. Madame de Longueville's mind was not, above all else,\r\nrational; it was acute, prompt, subtle, witty by turns, and readily\r\nresponsive to the varying humour of the moment. It shone voluntarily in\r\ncontradiction and subterfuge, ere exhausting itself finally in scruples.\r\nThere was much of the Hotel de Rambouillet in such a mind as hers.\r\n\r\n\"The mind in the majority of women serves rather to confirm their folly\r\nthan their reason.\" So says the author of the \"Maxims;\" and Madame de\r\nLongueville, with all her metamorphoses, was undoubtedly present before\r\nhim when he penned the sentence. For she, the most feminine of her sex,\r\nwould offer to him the completest epitome of all the rest. In short,\r\nevidently as he has made his observations upon her, she also seems to\r\nhave drawn her conclusions from him. So the agreement is perfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA YOUNG Princess of the Blood so lovely, fascinating, and witty as Anne\r\nde Bourbon, was surely destined, it might be thought, to contract an\r\nearly and altogether suitable matrimonial alliance. It was therefore\r\nsomewhat surprising to find how much difficulty there was in mating her.\r\nForemost among those who sought her hand was that hair-brained,\r\nhandsome, coarse-mannered Duke de Beaufort, younger son of Caesar de\r\nVendome, himself the bastard of the jovial Bearnois by the _Fair\r\nGabrielle_.[1] Beaufort inherited his unfortunate grand-dame's\r\nbeauty--had a Phoebus-Apollo style of head, set off with a profusion\r\nof long, curly, golden locks; was a young, brave, and flourishing\r\ngallant, and somewhat later (during the Fronde), from his blunt speech\r\nand familiar manners with the Parisian mob, became the idol of the\r\nmarket-women, and was therefore dubbed _Roi des Halles_. But this\r\nscapegrace suitor withdrew his pretensions in order to gratify, it is\r\nsaid, the handsome though decried Duchess de Montbazon, who had\r\nenthralled him in her flowery chains as a led-captain. On entering her\r\nnineteenth year Mdlle. de Bourbon was promised in marriage to the Prince\r\nde Joinville, son of Charles of Lorraine (Duke de Guise), but that young\r\nnobleman having died prematurely in Italy, no other serious matrimonial\r\nproject seems to have been entertained until the Princess had reached\r\nher twenty-third year. The fortunate suitor was one of Beaufort's\r\nrivals--or, rather, colleagues--for that would be the more correct term\r\nwhen designating their mutual relations to the unscrupulous Duchess de\r\nMontbazon. The widower, Henry of Orleans (Duke de Longueville), by\r\nbirth, dignity, and wealth was looked upon as the first match in France.\r\nUnfortunately, in his case, those dazzling attributes were materially\r\nabated through disparity of age, for he had reached the ripe maturity of\r\nforty-seven, whilst the bride of his choice had not yet seen half that\r\ncycle of summers. To be twenty-four years her senior was, for the\r\nhusband of a youthful princess so excelling in wit and beauty, certainly\r\na formidable inequality, and so Mdlle. de Bourbon seems to have thought.\r\nAt the command, however, of her father, who intimated that his\r\ndetermination was inflexible in thus disposing of his daughter's hand,\r\nAnne Genevieve meekly complied, and was espoused in June, 1642, to Henri\r\nde Bourbon, Duke de Longueville.[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] Created Duchess de Beaufort by Henry IV.\r\n\r\n    [2] The Duke was descended from the \"brave Dunois,\" bastard of\r\n    Orleans.\r\n\r\nThe young Duchess found herself speedily surrounded by a swarm of\r\ncourtiers, attracted by her sprightly and refined intelligence, her\r\nmajestic beauty, her nonchalant and languishing grace. What more\r\nadorable mistress could an audacious aspirant dream of? Bold adventurers\r\nfor such a lady's love there was no lack of; and would not many be\r\nencouraged with the thought that such a prize could only be defended by\r\na husband already verging towards the decline of life, and whose heart,\r\nmoreover, was believed to be in the keeping of another? The sighs of the\r\nsuitors, however, all adventurous and calculating as they might be, were\r\nwasted, their hopes altogether fallacious. For six long years there was\r\nnothing more accorded to that crowd of often-renewed adorers save the\r\nsmiles of an innocent coquetry. He who, during that period of honest\r\ngallantry, coming near to La Rochefoucauld, seems to have made the\r\nliveliest impression, was Coligny; and it was only slanderers who\r\nwhispered that the young Count was happier than became the adorer of a\r\nheroine of the De Rambouillet school.\r\n\r\nMadame de Longueville, nevertheless, possessed the characteristics of\r\nher sex; she had alike its lovable qualities and its well-known\r\nimperfections. In a sphere where gallantry was the order of the day,\r\nthat young and fascinating creature, married to a man already in the\r\ndecline of life, and, moreover, with his affections engaged elsewhere,\r\nmerely followed the universal example. Tender by nature, the senses, she\r\nherself says in her confessions--the humblest ever made--played no minor\r\npart in the affairs of the heart. But, surrounded unceasingly by homage,\r\nshe found pleasure in receiving it. Very lovable, she centred her\r\nhappiness in being loved. Sister of the Great Conde, she was not\r\ninsensible to the idea of playing a part which should occupy public\r\nattention; but, far from pretending to domination, there was so much of\r\nthe woman in her that she allowed herself to be led by him whom she\r\nloved. Whilst, around her, interest and ambition assumed so frequently\r\nthe hues of love, she listened to the dictates of her heart alone, and\r\ndevoted herself to the interest and ambition of another. All\r\ncontemporary writers are unanimous on that point. Her enemies sharply\r\nreproach her alike for not having a fitting object in her political\r\nintrigues, and for being unmindful of her own interests. But they appear\r\nnot to be aware that, in thinking to overwhelm her memory by such\r\naccusation, they rather elevate it, and they are assiduous to cover her\r\nfaults and misconduct--faults which, after all, are centred in one\r\nalone. In short, some writers cast the greater part of the blame the\r\nyoung Duchess's conduct merits upon her husband, who, according to them,\r\nknew not how to make amends for his own disadvantage, on the score of\r\ndisparity of age, by an anxious and indulgent tenderness.\r\n\r\nBefore their marriage was solemnised it was stipulated that the Duke de\r\nLongueville should break off his _liaison_ with the Duchess de\r\nMontbazon--then notorious as one of the most unrestrained among the\r\nwomen of fashion at the Court of the Regent. This, however, the Duke\r\nunhappily failed to do.\r\n\r\nIn declaring its adhesion to Mazarin at the commencement of the Regency,\r\nthe House of Conde had drawn upon itself the hatred of the party of the\r\n_Importants_, though that enmity scarcely rebounded upon Madame de\r\nLongueville. Her amiableness in everything where her heart was not\r\nseriously concerned, her perfect indifference to politics at this period\r\nof her life, together with the graces of her mind and person, rendered\r\nher universally popular, and shielded her against the injustice of\r\npartisan malice. But outside the pale of politics she had an enemy, and\r\na formidable one, in the Duchess de Montbazon. That bold and dangerous\r\nwoman having by her fascinations enslaved Beaufort, the quondam admirer\r\nof Madame de Longueville, the young Duke through her intrigues became a\r\nfavourite chief of the _Importants_. Amongst the earliest to swell the\r\nranks of that faction were two other personages who had played a very\r\nconspicuous part during the reign of Louis XIII. The first of these,\r\nMadame de Montbazon's step-daughter, was the witty, beautiful, and\r\nerrant Duchess de Chevreuse, whom Louis had judged so dangerous that he\r\nhad expressly forbidden by his will, when on the point of death, that\r\nshe should ever be recalled from exile to Court. By the same prohibition\r\nwas affected the former Keeper of the Seals, the Marquis de Chateauneuf,\r\nwho had displayed considerable talent under Richelieu, but had\r\nultimately made himself obnoxious to that great Minister, after having\r\ngiven many a sanguinary proof of his devotion to him. A glance at the\r\nantecedents of that remarkable woman, Madame de Chevreuse, the early\r\nfavourite of Anne of Austria, will now be necessary in order to\r\nunderstand clearly her relative position to the Queen and Mazarin at the\r\ncommencement of the Regency, as well as to those incipient _Frondeurs_,\r\nthe _Importants_, at the moment of her dragging the Prince de Marsillac\r\n(afterwards Duke de Rochefoucauld) into that party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE DUCHESS DE CHEVREUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the long-sustained, vigorous, and very eminent part played by Marie\r\nde Rohan in opposing the repressive system of the two great Cardinal\r\nMinisters, her name belongs equally to the political history as to that\r\nof the society and manners of the first half of the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nShe came of that old and illustrious race the issue of the first princes\r\nof Brittany, and was the daughter of Hercule de Rohan, Duke de\r\nMontbazon, a zealous servant of Henry IV., by his first wife Madeleine\r\nde Lenoncourt, sister of Urbain de Laval, Marshal de Bois-Dauphin. Born\r\nin December, 1600, she lost her mother at a very early age, and in 1617\r\nwas married to that audacious favourite of Louis XIII., De Luynes, who\r\nfrom the humble office of \"bird-catcher\" to the young King, rose to the\r\nproud dignity of Constable of France, and who, upon the faith of a\r\nking's capricious friendship, dared to undertake the reversal of the\r\nQueen-mother, Marie de' Medici's authority; hurl to destruction her\r\ngreat favourite, the Marshal d'Ancre; combat simultaneously princes and\r\nProtestants, and commence against Richelieu the system of Richelieu.\r\nEarly becoming a widow, Marie next, in 1622, entered the house of\r\nLorraine by espousing Claude, Duke de Chevreuse, one of the sons of\r\nHenry de Guise, great Chamberlain of France, whose highest merit was the\r\nname he bore, accompanied by good looks and that bravery which was\r\nnever wanting to a prince of Lorraine; otherwise disorderly in the\r\nconduct of his affairs, of not very edifying manner of life, which may\r\ngo far to explain and extenuate the errors of his young wife. The new\r\nDuchess de Chevreuse had been appointed during the sway of her first\r\nhusband, _surintendante_ (controller) of the Queen's household, and soon\r\nbecame as great a favourite of Anne of Austria as the Constable de\r\nLuynes was of Louis _the Just_. The French Court was then very\r\nbrilliant, and gallantry the order of the day. Marie de Rohan was\r\nnaturally vivacious and dashing, and, yielding herself up to the\r\nseductions of youth and pleasure, she had lovers, and her adorers drew\r\nher into politics. Her beauty and captivating manners were such as to\r\nfascinate and enthral the least impressible who crossed her path, and\r\ntheir dangerous power was extensively employed in influencing the\r\npolitics of Europe, and consequently had a large share in framing her\r\nown destiny. A portrait in the possession of the late Duke de Luynes[1]\r\nrepresents her as having an admirable figure, a charming expression of\r\ncountenance, large and well-opened blue eyes, chesnut-tinted fair hair\r\nin great abundance, a well-formed neck, with the loveliest bust\r\npossible, and throughout her entire person a piquant blending of\r\ndelicacy, grace, vivacity, and passion. The following summary of her\r\ncharacter by the clever, caustic, but little scrupulous De Retz, graphic\r\nas it is, and based on a certain amount of truth, must not be\r\nunhesitatingly accepted, it being over-coloured by wilful\r\nexaggeration:--\"I have never seen anyone else,\" says he, \"in whom\r\nvivacity so far usurped the place of judgment. It very often inspired\r\nher with such brilliant sallies that they flashed like lightning, and so\r\nsensible withal, that they might not have been disowned by the greatest\r\nmen of any age. The manifestation of this faculty was not confined to\r\nparticular occasions. Had she lived in times when politics were\r\nnon-existent, she would not have rested content with the idea only that\r\nthey ought to have been rife. If the Prior of the Carthusians had\r\npleased her, she would have become a sincere recluse. M. de Luynes\r\ninitiated her into politics, the Duke of Buckingham and the Earl of\r\nHolland corresponded with her upon them, and Chateauneuf amused her with\r\nthem. She gave herself up to their pursuit because she abandoned\r\nherself, without reserve, to everything which pleased the individual\r\nwhom she loved, and simply because it was indispensable that she should\r\nlove somebody. It was not even difficult to give her a lover by setting\r\nan eligible suitor to pay her court with an ostensible political motive;\r\nbut as soon as she accepted him, she loved him solely and faithfully,\r\nand she owned to Mdme. de Rhodes and myself that, through caprice, she\r\nsaid, she had never really loved those whom she esteemed the most, with\r\nthe exception of the unfortunate George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham.\r\nDevotion to the passion which in her might be called eternal, although\r\nshe might change the object of it, did not prevent even a fly from\r\ncausing her mental abstraction; but she always recovered from it with a\r\nrenewed exuberance which made such phases rather agreeable than\r\notherwise. No one ever took less heed about danger, and never woman had\r\nmore contempt for scruples and duties: she never recognised other than\r\nthat of pleasing her lover.\"\r\n\r\n    [1] This nobleman died at Rome in December, 1867, at the age of\r\n    sixty-five, having gone thither to aid the Pope against the\r\n    Garibaldians.\r\n\r\nThis epigrammatic sketch is almost worthy of the exaggerated author of\r\nthe _Historiettes_,[2] and the reader is advised to accept only its more\r\nsalient and truthful traits--the keen and accurate glance of Mdme. de\r\nChevreuse in scanning the prevailing aspect of the political horizon,\r\nher dauntless courage, the fidelity and devotion of her love. Retz,\r\nmoreover, mistakes entirely the order of her adventures; he forgets and\r\nthen invents. In striving after epigrammatic point, he sacrifices truth\r\nto smartness of style, and writes as though he looked upon events in\r\nwhich the passions of the Duchess made her take part as mere trifles,\r\nwhereas among them there were some than which none were ever of graver\r\nor even more tragic moment.\r\n\r\n    [2] Tallement des Reaux.\r\n\r\nMdme. de Chevreuse, in fact, possessed almost all the qualities\r\nbefitting a great politician. One alone was wanting, and precisely that\r\nwithout which all the others tended to her ruin. She failed to select\r\nfor pursuit a legitimate object, or rather she did not choose one for\r\nherself, but left it to another to choose for her. Mdme. de Chevreuse\r\nwas womanly in the highest possible degree; that quality was alike her\r\nstrength and her weakness. Her secret mainspring was love, or rather\r\ngallantry,[3] and the interest of him whom she loved became her\r\nparamount object. It is this which explains the wonderful sagacity,\r\nfinesse, and energy she displayed in the vain pursuit of a chimerical\r\naim, which ever receded before her, and seemed to draw her on by the\r\nvery prestige of difficulty and danger. La Rochefoucauld accuses her of\r\nhaving brought misfortune upon all those whom she loved;[4] it is\r\nequally the truth to add that all those whom she loved hurried her in\r\nthe sequel into insensate enterprises. It was not she evidently who\r\nmade of Buckingham a species of paladin without genius; a brilliant\r\nadventurer of Charles IV. of Lorraine; of Chalais a hair-brained\r\nblunderer, rash enough to commit himself in a conspiracy against\r\nRichelieu, on the faith of the faithless Duke d'Orleans; of Chateauneuf,\r\nan ambitious statesman, impatient of holding second rank in the\r\nGovernment, without being capable of taking the first. Let no one\r\nimagine that he is acquainted with Mdme. de Chevreuse from having merely\r\nstudied the foregoing portrait traced by De Retz, for that sketch is an\r\nexaggeration and over-charged like all those from the same pen, and was\r\ndestined to amuse the malignant curiosity of Mdme. de Caumartin--for\r\nwithout being altogether false, it is of a severity pushed to the verge\r\nof injustice. Was it becoming, one might ask, of the restless and\r\nlicentious Coadjutor to constitute himself the remorseless censor of a\r\nwoman whose errors he shared? Did he not deceive himself as much and for\r\na far longer period than she? Did he show more address in political\r\nstrategy or courage in the dangerous strife, more intrepidity and\r\nconstancy in defeat? But Mdme. de Chevreuse has not written memoirs in\r\nthat free-and-easy and piquant style the constant aim of which is\r\nself-elevation, obtained at the expense of everybody else. There are two\r\njudges of her character the testimony of whose acts must be held to be\r\nabove suspicion--Richelieu and Mazarin. Richelieu did all in his power\r\nto win her over, and not being able to succeed, he treated her as an\r\nenemy worthy of himself.\r\n\r\n    [3] Mdme. de Motteville.\r\n\r\n    [4] Memoires, Petitot's Collection, 2nd series, vol. li. p. 339.\r\n\r\nTo revert briefly to her long-continued struggle with Richelieu, it must\r\nnot be forgotten that for twenty years she had been the personal friend\r\nand favourite of Anne of Austria, and for ten years she had suffered\r\npersecution and privation on that account. Exiled, proscribed, and\r\nthreatened with imprisonment, she had narrowly escaped Richelieu's grasp\r\nby disguising herself in male attire, and in that garb traversing France\r\nand Spain on horseback, had succeeded in eluding his pursuit, and after\r\nmany adventures in safely reaching Madrid. Philip IV. not only heaped\r\nevery kind of honour upon his sister's courageous favourite, but even,\r\nit is said, swelled the number of her conquests. Whilst in the Spanish\r\ncapital she had allied herself politically with the Minister Olivarez,\r\nand obtained great ascendancy over the Cabinet of Madrid. The war\r\nbetween France and Spain necessarily rendering her position in the\r\nlatter country delicate and embarrassing, she had, early in 1638, sought\r\nrefuge in England. Charles I. and Henrietta Maria gave her the warmest\r\npossible reception at St. James's; and the latter, on seeing again the\r\ndistinguished countrywoman who had some years back conducted her as a\r\nbride from Paris to the English shores to the arms of Prince Charles,\r\nembraced her warmly, entered into all her troubles, and both the English\r\nKing and Queen wrote letters pleading in her behalf, to Louis XIII.,\r\nAnne of Austria, and Richelieu with regard to the restoration of her\r\nproperty and permission to rejoin her children at Dampierre. She herself\r\nresumed the links of a negotiation with the Cardinal which had never\r\nbeen entirely broken off, and the success of which seemed quite\r\npracticable, since it was almost equally desired by both. That\r\nnegotiation was being carried on for more than a year, and when link\r\nafter link had been frequently snapped and re-soldered, only to be once\r\nmore broken, Richelieu at length gave his solemn word that she might\r\nreturn with perfect safety to Dampierre.\r\n\r\nOn the eve of her departure from the English Court, a vessel being in\r\nreadiness to convey her to Dieppe, where a carriage awaited her landing,\r\nthe Duchess received an anonymous letter warning her that certain ruin\r\nawaited her if she set foot on the soil of France, followed by another,\r\nstill more explicit with regard to Richelieu's designs to effect her\r\ndestruction, from no less a person than Charles of Lorraine. This second\r\nwarning from so reliable a source, followed shortly afterwards by other\r\nadvice--held by her in the light of a command--enchained her to a\r\nforeign land. She for whom during ten long years the Duchess had\r\nsuffered all things, braved all things, her august friend Anne of\r\nAustria cautioned her not to trust to appearances. Thus vanished the\r\nlast hope of a sincere reconciliation between two persons who knew each\r\nother too well to discard distrust and to confide in words, of which\r\nneither were sparing, without requiring solemn guarantees that they\r\ncould not or would not give.\r\n\r\nChoosing stoically, therefore, to still undergo the pangs of absence, to\r\nconsume the noontide of the days of her attractive womanhood in\r\nprivation and turmoil rather than risk her liberty, Mdme. de Chevreuse\r\non her part did not remain idle. From the moment she felt convinced that\r\nRichelieu was deceiving her, attracting her back to France only to hold\r\nher in a state of dependence, and if need were, to incarcerate\r\nher--having broken with him, she considered herself as free from all\r\nscruple, and thought of nothing further than paying him back blow for\r\nblow. Her old duel with the Cardinal thus once more renewed, she formed\r\nin London, with the aid of the Duke de Vendome, La Vieuville, and La\r\nValette, a faction of active and adroit emigrants, who, leaning on the\r\nEarl of Holland, then one of the chiefs of the Royalist party and a\r\ngeneral in the army of Charles of England; upon Lord Montagu, an ardent\r\nPapist and intimate adviser of Queen Henrietta Maria; upon Digby and\r\nother men of influence at Court, maintained likewise the closest\r\nintelligence with the Court of Rome through its envoy in England,\r\nRosetti, and especially with the Cabinet of Madrid; encouraging and\r\nkindling the hopes of all the proscribed and discontented, strewing\r\nobstacles at all points in the path of Richelieu, and accumulating\r\nformidable perils around his head.\r\n\r\nOn the breaking out of the Civil War in England, Mdme. de Chevreuse\r\nrepaired to Brussels, where in 1641 we find her acting as the connecting\r\nlink between England, Spain, and Lorraine. Without attributing to the\r\nDuchess any especial motive beyond seconding an enterprise directed\r\nagainst the common enemy, she did not the less play an important part in\r\nthe affair of the Count de Soissons--the most formidable conspiracy that\r\nhad hitherto been hatched against Richelieu. Anne of Austria was\r\ncertainly privy to the plot and lent it her aid. She might have been\r\nignorant of the secret treaty with Spain; but for all the rest, and so\r\nfar as it menaced the Cardinal, she had a perfect understanding with the\r\nconspirators. That high-handed Minister, by overstraining the springs of\r\ngovernment, by prolonging the war, by increasing the public expenditure,\r\nand by oppressing all classes whilst he crushed some in particular, had\r\nexcited a hatred so bitter and widespread that at length he governed the\r\nState almost entirely through terror. Whilst the grandeur of his designs\r\ncommanded respect and veneration from a select few, his genius towered\r\nabove the bulk of his countrymen. But that harsh rule, continuing\r\nunrelaxed, and so many sacrifices being perpetually renewed, at length\r\nwearied out the greater number, the King himself not excepted. Louis's\r\nreigning favourite, the Grand-Ecuyer, Cinq Mars, undermined and\r\nblackened the Cardinal as much as possible in his royal master's\r\nestimation. He knew of the conspiracy of the Count de Soissons, and\r\nwithout taking a share in it, he favoured it. He might therefore be\r\nreckoned upon to figure in the next. The Queen, still in disgrace in\r\nspite of the two heirs she had given to the crown, naturally breathed\r\nvows for the termination of a rule which so oppressed her. Gaston, the\r\nKing's brother, had pledged his word, however little the reliance that\r\nmight be placed upon it; but the Duke de Bouillon, an experienced\r\nsoldier and an eminent politician, had openly declared himself; and his\r\nstronghold of Sedan, situated on the frontiers of France and Belgium,\r\noffered an asylum whence could be braved for a long while all the power\r\nof the Cardinal. A widespread understanding had been established\r\nthroughout every part of the kingdom, amongst the clergy, and in the\r\nParliament. There were conspirators in the very Bastille itself, where\r\nMarshal de Vitry and the Count de Cramail, prisoners as they were, had\r\nprepared a _coup de main_ with an admirably-kept secrecy. The Abbe de\r\nRetz, then twenty-five, preluded his adventurous career by this attempt\r\nat civil war. The Duke de Guise, having effected his escape from Rheims,\r\nand taken refuge in the Low Countries, was about to share the dangers of\r\nthe conspiracy at Sedan. But the greatest--the firmest--hope of the\r\nCount de Soissons rested upon Spain: that power alone could enable him\r\nto take the field from Sedan, to march upon Paris, and crush the power\r\nof Richelieu. He therefore despatched Alexandre de Campion, one of his\r\nbravest and most intelligent gentlemen, to Brussels to negotiate with\r\nthe Spanish Ministers and obtain from them troops and money. There he\r\naddressed himself to Mdme. de Chevreuse, and confided to her the mission\r\nwith which he was charged, which she hastened to second with all her\r\ninfluence. Having prevailed upon Olivarez to strenuously support those\r\nrequirements which the Count de Soissons and the Duke de Bouillon sought\r\nat his hands, she despatched letters by a secret agent in the service of\r\nSpain to the Duke de Lorraine, entreating him not to fail her in this\r\nsupreme opportunity of repairing her past misfortunes and of dealing a\r\nmortal blow to their remorseless enemy. The Duke Charles, thus solicited\r\nat once by Mdme. de Chevreuse, by his kinsman the Duke de Guise, by the\r\nSpanish Minister, and, more than all, by his own restless and\r\nadventurous ambition, broke the solemn compact he had so recently made\r\nwith France, entered into an alliance with Spain and the Count de\r\nSoissons, and prepared with all diligence to march to the aid of Sedan.\r\nAnd whilst Mdme. de Chevreuse and the emigrants brought into play every\r\nengine they could lay hands on, Lamboy and Metternich set out for\r\nFlanders at the head of six thousand Imperialists. France--all the\r\nnationalities of Europe, were on the tiptoe of expectation. Richelieu\r\nhad never been menaced with a greater danger, and the loss of the battle\r\nof Marfee would have proved a fatal event had not the Count de Soissons\r\nmet his death simultaneously with his triumph.\r\n\r\nIf Mdme. de Chevreuse were a stranger in 1642 to the fresh conspiracy of\r\nGaston, Duke d'Orleans, Cinq Mars, and the Duke de Bouillon against her\r\nrelentless foe, it would have been the only one in which she had not\r\ntaken a leading part. It is indeed more than probable that she was in\r\nthe secret as well as Queen Anne, whose understanding with Gaston and\r\nCinq Mars cannot be contested. La Rochefoucauld repeatedly remarks\r\ntouching a matter in which he seems to have been implicated, \"The\r\ndazzling reputation of M. le Grand (Cinq Mars) rekindled the hopes of\r\nthe discontented; the Queen and the Duke d'Orleans united with him; the\r\nDuke de Bouillon and several persons of quality did the same.\" De\r\nBouillon also declares that the Queen was closely allied with Gaston and\r\nthe Grand-Ecuyer, and that she herself had invited his concurrence. \"The\r\nQueen, whom the Cardinal had persecuted in such a variety of ways, did\r\nnot doubt that, if the King should chance to die, that minister would\r\nseek to deprive her of her children, in order to assume the Regency\r\nhimself. She secretly instigated De Thou to seek the Duke de Bouillon\r\nwith persevering entreaties. She asked the latter whether, in the event\r\nof the King's death, he would promise to receive her and her two\r\nchildren in his stronghold of Sedan, believing--so firmly persuaded was\r\nshe of the evil designs of the Cardinal, and of his power--that there\r\nwas no other place of safety for them throughout the realm of France.\"\r\nDe Thou further told the Duke de Bouillon that since the King's illness\r\nthe Queen and the Duke d'Orleans were very closely allied, and that it\r\nwas through Cinq Mars that their alliance had been brought about. Now,\r\nwhere the Queen was so deeply implicated it was not likely that Mdme. de\r\nChevreuse would stand aloof. A friend of Richelieu, whose name has not\r\ncome down to us, but who must have been perfectly well informed, does\r\nnot hesitate to place Mdme. de Chevreuse as well as the Queen amongst\r\nthose who then endeavoured to overthrow Richelieu. \"M. le Grand,\" he\r\nwrites to the Cardinal,[5] \"has been urged to his wicked designs by the\r\nQueen-mother, by her daughter (Henrietta Maria), by the Queen of France,\r\nby Mdme. de Chevreuse, by Montagu, and other English Papists.\" At length\r\nthe Cardinal, on an early day in June, 1642, retired to Tarascon,\r\nostensibly for the sake of his health, but doubtless for safety also,\r\naccompanied by his two bosom friends, Mazarin and Chavigny, and the\r\nfaithful regiments of his guards. Finding himself surrounded by peril on\r\nall sides, and representing to Louis XIII. the gravity of the situation,\r\nhe cited that which had been alleged of Mdme. de Chevreuse as amongst\r\nthe most striking indications of the truth of what he stated.[6]\r\n\r\n    [5] Archives des Affaires Etrangeres; FRANCE, tom. CI.\r\n\r\n    [6] Archives des Affaires Etrangeres; FRANCE, tom. cii. Inedited\r\n    Memoir of Richelieu.\r\n\r\nBut what _was_ the party in fact then conspiring against Richelieu? Was\r\nit not the party of former coalitions--of the League, of Austria, and of\r\nSpain? And Mdme. Chevreuse at Brussels, through her connection with the\r\nDuke de Lorraine, the Queen of England, the Chevalier de Jars at Rome,\r\nthe Minister Olivarez at Madrid--was she not one of the great motive\r\npowers of that party? When, therefore, such machinery was found to be\r\nagain in activity, it was quite reasonable to suspect the hand of Mdme.\r\nde Chevreuse in all its movements.\r\n\r\nThe gathering cloud that now lowered so thick and threatening above the\r\nhead of Richelieu seemed pregnant with inevitable destruction to his\r\npower and life. But ere long his eagle glance pierced through the\r\novershadowing gloom, and the aim of Cinq Mars' dark intrigue became\r\nclearly revealed to his far-seeing introspection. A treachery, the\r\nsecret of which has remained impenetrable to every research made during\r\nthe last two centuries, caused the treaty concluded with Spain through\r\nthe intervention of Fontrailles, and bearing the signatures of Gaston,\r\nCinq Mars, and the Duke de Bouillon, to fall into his hands. From that\r\ninstant the Cardinal felt certain of victory. He knew Louis XIII.\r\nthoroughly; he conjectured that he might in some access of his morbid\r\nand changeful humour have uttered reproachful words against his Minister\r\nin the favourite's ear--even expressed a wish to be rid of him, as did\r\nour first Plantagenet when tired of the despotism of Thomas a\r\nBecket--and had perhaps listened to strange proposals for effecting such\r\nobject. But the Cardinal knew right well also to what extent Louis was a\r\nking and a Frenchman, and devoted by self-interest to their common\r\nsystem. He despatched, therefore, Chavigny in all haste from Narbonne\r\nwith irrefragable evidence of the treaty made with Spain. Louis,\r\nthunderstricken, could scarcely believe his own eyes. He sank into a\r\ngloomy reverie, out of which he emerged only to give way to bursts of\r\nindignation against the favourite who could thus abuse his confidence\r\nand conspire with the foreigner. It was needless to inflame his anger,\r\nhe was the first to call for an exemplary punishment. Not for a day, not\r\nfor an hour, did his heart soften towards the youthful culprit who had\r\nbeen so dear to him. He thought only of his crime, and signed without an\r\ninstant's hesitation his death-warrant. If Louis the Just spared the\r\nDuke de Bouillon, it was merely to acquire Sedan. If he pardoned his\r\nbrother Gaston, he at the same time dishonoured him by depriving him of\r\nall authority in the State. Upon a report spread by a servant of\r\nFontrailles, and which Fontrailles' memoirs fully confirm, his\r\nsuspicions were directed towards the Queen; and no one afterwards could\r\ndivest his mind of the conviction that in this instance, as in the\r\naffair of Chalais, Anne of Austria had an understanding with his\r\nbrother, the Duke d'Orleans. What would he have done had he perused the\r\nstatement of Fontrailles, the Duke de Bouillon's memoirs, a letter of\r\nTurenne, and the declaration of La Rochefoucauld? Their united testimony\r\nis so concordant that it is altogether irresistible. The Queen racked\r\nher brains to exorcise this fresh storm, and to persuade the King and\r\nRichelieu of her innocence. Anne went much farther; she did not confine\r\nherself to falsehood and dissimulation. Menaced by imminent danger, she\r\nwent so far as to repudiate that courageous friend who had been so long\r\nand steadfastly devoted to her. Had fortune declared in her favour she\r\nwould have embraced the Duchess as a deliverer. Vanquished and disarmed,\r\nshe abandoned her. As she had protested in terms of horror against the\r\nconspiracy that had failed, her two young, imprudent, and ill-starred\r\naccomplices, Cinq Mars and De Thou, mounted the scaffold without\r\nbreathing her name. Finding also both the King and Richelieu violently\r\nexasperated against Mdme. de Chevreuse, and firmly resolved to reject\r\nthe renewed entreaties of her family to obtain her recall, Anne of\r\nAustria, far from interceding for her faithful adherent, warmly sided\r\nwith her enemies; and further, to indicate the change in her own\r\nsentiments, and seem to applaud that which she could not prevent, she\r\nasked as an especial favour that the Duchess might be estranged from her\r\nperson, and even from France. \"The Queen,\" wrote Chavigny, Richelieu's\r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, \"has pointedly asked me if it were true\r\nthat Mdme. de Chevreuse would return; and, without waiting for a reply,\r\nshe signified to me that she should be vexed to find her presently in\r\nFrance; that she now saw the Duchess in her proper light; and she\r\ncommanded me to pray His Eminence on her part, if he had any mind to\r\nfavour Mdme. de Chevreuse, that it might be done without granting her\r\npermission to return to France. I assured her Majesty that she should\r\nhave satisfaction on that point.\"[7]\r\n\r\n    [7] Archives des Affaires Etrangeres, FRANCE, tom. CI.\r\n\r\nPoor Marie de Rohan! Her heart already bled from many wounds, but this\r\nlast was the \"unkindest cut of all.\" Her position had indeed become\r\nfrightful, and calculated to sink her to the lowest depth of despair. No\r\nhope of seeing her native land again, her princely chateau, her\r\nchildren, her favourite daughter Charlotte! Deriving scarcely anything\r\nfrom France, deeply in debt, and with credit exhausted, she found\r\nherself entirely at the end of her resources. How thoroughly did the\r\nbanished woman then realise the woes of exile--how hard it is to climb\r\nand descend the stranger's stair, experience the hollowness of his\r\npromise, and the arrogance of his commiseration. And, finally, as though\r\nfated to drain her cup of bitterness to the last drop, to learn that\r\nshe, her long-loved bosom friend and royal mistress, who owed her, at\r\nthe very least, a silent fidelity, had openly ranged herself on the side\r\nof fortune and Richelieu!\r\n\r\nIn a condition of mental torture the most acute, resulting from such\r\naccumulated misfortune, Madame de Chevreuse remained for several months\r\nwith no other support than that of her innate high-souled courage. At\r\nlength, towards the close of that eventful year, the golden grooves of\r\nchange rung out a joyous paean to gladden the heart of the much-enduring\r\nexile. Suddenly Marie--all Europe--heard with a throb that the\r\ninscrutable, iron-handed man of all the human race most dreaded alike by\r\nStates as by individuals, had yielded to a stronger power than his own,\r\nand had closed his eyes in death (December 4, 1642). Within a few short\r\nmonths afterwards the King also, whose regal power he had consolidated\r\nat such a cost in blood and suffering, followed the great statesman to\r\nthe tomb; having entrusted the Regency, very much against his will, to\r\nthe Queen, but controlled by a Council, over which presided as Prime\r\nMinister the man most devoted to Richelieu's system--his closest friend,\r\nconfidant, and creature--Jules Mazarin.\r\n\r\nA passage in the funeral oration on Louis XIII. summed up briefly but\r\nsignificantly the result of Richelieu's gigantic efforts to consolidate\r\nthe regal power. \"Sixty-three kings,\" it said, \"had preceded him in rule\r\nof the realm, but he alone had rendered it absolute, and what all\r\ncollectively had been impotent to achieve in the course of twelve\r\ncenturies for the grandeur of France, he had accomplished in the short\r\nspace of thirty-three years.\" It was against that absolute power\r\nincarnate in Richelieu, which from the steps of the throne hurled men to\r\nthe earth with its bolts rather than governed them, that Mazarin was\r\ndestined later to encounter the reaction of the Fronde.\r\n\r\nDistrustful of leaving Anne of Austria in uncontrolled possession of\r\nregal authority, Louis by his last will and testament had placed\r\nroyalty, including his brother Gaston as lieutenant-general of the\r\nrealm, in a manner under a commission. And further, Louis did not\r\nbelieve that he could ensure quiet to the State after his death without\r\nconfirming and perpetuating, so far as in him lay, the perpetual exile\r\nof Madame de Chevreuse.\r\n\r\nAs the pupil and confidential friend of Richelieu, Mazarin had imbibed\r\nboth that statesman's and the late king's opinions and sentiments\r\ntouching the influence of that eminently dangerous woman. Though he had\r\nnever seen her hitherto, he was not the less well acquainted with her by\r\nrepute: dreading her mortally, and cherishing a like antipathy to her\r\nfriend Chateauneuf. He knew the Duchess to be as seductive as she was\r\ntalented, experienced and courageous in party strife--an instance of\r\nwhich was that she could sway entirely a man of such ambition and\r\ncapacity as the former Keeper of the Seals. Attached, moreover, in\r\nsecret to Lorraine, to Austria, and to Spain, all this was as absolutely\r\nincompatible with the exclusive favour to which he aspired at the hands\r\nof his royal mistress as it was with all his diplomatic and military\r\ndesigns. The solemn injunctions of the late king's will, while\r\ndenouncing Madame de Chevreuse and Chateauneuf as the two most\r\nillustrious victims of the close of his reign, embodied also the heads\r\nof the policy which it was that monarch's wish should be continued by\r\nRichelieu's successor. \"Forasmuch,\" ran the will, \"that for weighty\r\nreasons, important to the welfare of our State, we found ourselves\r\ncompelled to deprive the Sieur de Chateauneuf of the post of Keeper of\r\nthe Seals of France, and have him sent to the Castle of Angouleme, in\r\nwhich he has remained by our command up to the present time, we will and\r\nintend that the said Sieur de Chateauneuf remain in the same state in\r\nwhich he is at present, in the said Castle of Angouleme, until after the\r\npeace be concluded and executed; under charge, nevertheless, that he\r\nshall not then be set at liberty save by the order of the Queen-Regent,\r\nunder the advice of her Council, which shall appoint a place to which he\r\nshall retire, within the realm or without the realm, as may be judged\r\nbest. And as our design is to take foresight of all such subjects as may\r\npossibly in some way or other disturb the precautionary arrangements\r\nwhich we have made to preserve the repose and safety of our realm, the\r\nknowledge that we have of the bad conduct of the Lady Duchess de\r\nChevreuse, of the artifices which she has employed up to this moment\r\nwithout the kingdom with our enemies, made us judge it fitting to forbid\r\nher, as we do, entrance into our kingdom during the war: desiring even\r\nthat after the peace be concluded and executed she may not return into\r\nour kingdom, save only under the orders of the said Lady Queen-Regent,\r\nwith the advice of the said Council, under charge, nevertheless, that\r\nshe shall not either take up her abode or be in any place near to the\r\nCourt or to the said Queen-Regent.\"\r\n\r\nWithin a few days only after the decease of Louis XIII. that same\r\nParliament which had enrolled his will reformed it. The Queen-Regent was\r\nfreed from every fetter and restriction, and invested with almost\r\nabsolute sovereignty; the ban was removed from the proscribed couple so\r\nsolemnly denounced, Chateauneuf's prison doors were thrown open, and\r\nMadame de Chevreuse quitted Brussels triumphantly, with a cortege of\r\ntwenty carriages, filled with lords and ladies of the highest rank in\r\nthat Court, to return once more to France and to the side of her royal\r\nfriend and mistress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  RETURN OF MADAME DE CHEVREUSE TO COURT.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER ten years' absence from the scene of her former triumphs, social\r\nand political, did the brilliant Duchess then once more find herself\r\nsafe and free in France. The _Gazette de Renaudot_--the _Moniteur_ of\r\nthat day--recording the return of Madame de Chevreuse, on the 14th of\r\nJune, 1643, remarks[1]:--\"During such long exile, this princess has\r\nmanifested what an elevated mind like hers can do, in spite of all those\r\nvicissitudes of fortune which her constancy has surmounted. The Duchess\r\nwent to pay homage to their Majesties, during which visit she received\r\nso many tokens of affection from the Queen-Regent, and gave her in\r\nreturn such proofs of her zeal in everything relating to her service,\r\nand so much resignation to her will, that it indeed appears that length\r\nof time, distance, or thorny asperities can only prevail over common\r\nminds. Hence the great train of visitors from this Court to her daily,\r\nand for which her spacious hotel scarcely affords room, does not excite\r\nso much wonder as the fact which has been the subject of remark, that\r\nthe fatigue consequent upon long journeys and the rigour of adverse\r\nfortune have worked no change in her magnanimity, nor--which is the more\r\nextraordinary--in her beauty.\"\r\n\r\n    [1] No. lxxvii. p. 579.\r\n\r\nMaking due allowance for the inflated diction of the complaisant Court\r\nnewswriter, let us endeavour to approach somewhat nearer to the truth.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse had then entered upon her forty-third year. Though\r\nstill surprisingly well-preserved, her beauty, tried by adversity, was\r\nvisibly on the decline. The inclination to gallantry still existed, but\r\nsubdued, politics having gained the supremacy. She had formed the\r\nacquaintance of, and held political relations with, the most celebrated\r\nstatesmen in Europe. She had figured at almost all its Courts, the\r\nstrength and weakness of its several Governments were known to her, and\r\nin her wanderings, having seen \"men and cities,\" she had acquired a\r\nlarge experience. The tried favourite hoped to find Anne of Austria the\r\nsame as she had left her--averse to business, and very willing to allow\r\nherself to be led by those for whom she had a particular affection; and\r\nas Madame de Chevreuse had been in her youthful days paramount in the\r\nQueen's affection, she fully expected to exercise over her that twofold\r\nascendancy which love and capacity would jointly give. More ambitious\r\nfor her friends than for herself, she saw them already rewarded for\r\ntheir long sacrifices, replacing everywhere the creatures of Richelieu,\r\nand at their head, in the highest post, as first minister, him who for\r\nher sake had broken with the triumphant Cardinal, and had endured an\r\nimprisonment of ten tedious years. She did not care much about Mazarin,\r\nwith whom she had no acquaintance, whom she had never seen, and who\r\nappeared to her unsupported either by the Court or the French nation,\r\nwhilst she felt herself sustained by all that was illustrious, powerful,\r\nand accredited therein. She believed that she could make sure of the\r\nDuke d'Orleans through his wife, the beautiful Margaret, sister of\r\nCharles of Lorraine. She could dispose almost at will of the Houses of\r\nRohan and Lorraine, particularly of the Duke de Guise and the Duke\r\nd'Elbeuf, like herself just returned from Flanders. She reckoned upon\r\nthe Vendomes, upon the Duke d'Epernon, upon La Vieuville, her old\r\ncompanions in exile in England; upon the ill-treated Bouillons, upon La\r\nRochefoucauld, whose disposition and pretensions were so well known to\r\nher; upon Lord Montagu, who had been her slave, and at that moment\r\npossessed the entire confidence of Anne of Austria; upon La Chatre, the\r\nfriend of the Vendomes, and Colonel-General of the Swiss Guards; upon\r\nTreville, upon Beringhen, upon Jars, upon La Porte, who were all\r\nemerging from exile, prison, and disgrace. Among the women, her young\r\nstepmother and her sister-in-law seemed secure--Madame de Montbazon and\r\nMadame de Guemene, the two greatest beauties of the time, who drew after\r\nthem a numerous crowd of old and young adorers. She knew also that among\r\nthe first acts of the Regent had been the recall to her side of the two\r\nnoble victims of Richelieu--Madame de Senece and Madame de Hautefort,\r\nwhose virtue and piety had conspired so beneficially with other\r\ninfluences, and had given them an inestimable weight in the household of\r\nAnne of Austria. All those calculations seemed accurate, all those hopes\r\nwell-founded; and Madame de Chevreuse left Brussels firmly persuaded\r\nthat she was about to re-enter the Louvre as a conqueress. She deceived\r\nherself: the Queen was already changed, or very nearly so.\r\n\r\nTo show due honour to her former favourite, however, Anne of Austria\r\ndespatched La Rochefoucauld to greet and escort her homewards; but\r\nbefore he set out she charged him to inform the Duchess of the altered\r\ndisposition in which she would find her royal mistress. During that\r\naudience Rochefoucauld did his utmost to reinstate his charming friend\r\nand close ally in the Queen's good graces. \"I spoke to her,\" says he,\r\n\"with more freedom perhaps than was becoming. I set before her Madame de\r\nChevreuse's fidelity, her long-continued services, and the severity of\r\nthe misfortunes which they had entailed upon her. I entreated her to\r\nconsider of what fickleness she would be thought capable, and what\r\ninterpretation might be placed upon such inconsiderateness if she should\r\nprefer Cardinal Mazarin to Madame de Chevreuse. Our conversation was\r\nlong and stormy, and I saw clearly that I had exasperated her.\" He then\r\nstarted to meet the Duchess on the road from Brussels, and found her at\r\nRoye, whither Montagu had already preceded him. Montagu had travelled to\r\nRoye to place Mazarin's homage at the feet of Madame de Chevreuse, with\r\nthe view of bringing about at any cost an union and identity of policy\r\nbetween the old and the new favourite. He was no longer the gay and\r\nsprightly Walter Montagu, the friend of Holland and Buckingham, the\r\nenamoured knight ever ready to break a lance against all comers for a\r\nglance of the bright eyes of Madame de Chevreuse. Time had changed him\r\nas well as others: he had become a bigot and a devotee, and already\r\ncontemplated taking orders in the Church of Rome. He still remained,\r\nhowever, attached to the object of his former adoration, but above all\r\nhe belonged to the Queen, and consequently resigned to Mazarin. La\r\nRochefoucauld--ever ready to ascribe to himself the chief share in any\r\nundertaking in which he figured, as well as the character of a great\r\npolitician--asserts that he entreated Madame de Chevreuse not to\r\nattempt at first to govern the Queen, but to endeavour solely to regain\r\nin Anne's mind and heart that place of which it had been sought to\r\ndeprive her, and to put herself in a position in which she would be able\r\nto protect or ruin the Cardinal, according to conduct or circumstances\r\nemanating from himself.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess listened attentively to the advice of both her old friends,\r\npromised to follow it, and did so in fact, but in her own peculiar way,\r\nand in that of the interest of the party she had so long served, and\r\nwhich she would not abandon. As Anne of Austria seemed much pleased at\r\nseeing the noble wanderer again, and gave her a warm reception, Marie\r\ndid not perceive any difference in the Queen's sentiments, and flattered\r\nherself that by constant assiduousness she would ere long resume that\r\nsway over the Regent's mind she had formerly exercised.\r\n\r\nOperating against this not unreasonable expectation of Madame de\r\nChevreuse, Mazarin had a silent but potent ally in the newly-awakened\r\ninclination of Anne for repose and a tranquil life. The first draughts\r\nof almost supreme power tasted by the long-oppressed Queen were not yet\r\nembittered by faction and anarchy. In bygone days, insult, neglect, and\r\npersecution had stirred her at intervals into mental activity, and urged\r\nher upon dangerous courses; but now, having obtained all she aimed at,\r\nhappy, and beginning to form attachments, she entertained a dread of\r\ntroublesome adventures and hazardous enterprises. She therefore feared\r\nMadame de Chevreuse quite as much as she loved her. The astute Cardinal\r\nanxiously strove to foster such distrust. He looked for support from the\r\nPrincess de Conde, then high in the Queen's favour, both through her own\r\nmerit as well as that of the Prince her husband, but more than all\r\nthrough the brilliant exploits of her son, the Duke d'Enghien; through\r\nthe services also of her son-in-law the Duke de Longueville, who had,\r\nwith honourable distinction, commanded the armies of Italy and Germany,\r\nand by her recently-married daughter, Madame de Longueville, already the\r\ndarling of the _salons_ and the Court. The Princess, like Queen Anne,\r\nhad in the heyday of her beauty been fond of homage and gallantry, but\r\nhad now grown serious, and displayed a somewhat lively piety. She held\r\nMadame de Chevreuse in aversion, and detested Chateauneuf, who, in 1632,\r\nat Toulouse, had presided at the trial and condemnation of her brother,\r\nHenri de Montmorency. She therefore had striven, in concert with\r\nMazarin, to destroy or at least weaken Madame de Chevreuse's hold upon\r\nthe Queen. Armed with the last will of Louis XIII., they had made it\r\nappear something like a fault in the Queen's eyes to disregard it so\r\nsoon and so entirely. They had given her to understand that former days\r\nand associations could never return; that the amusements and passions of\r\nearly youth were but \"evil accompaniments\"[2] of a later period of life;\r\nthat now she was before all things a mother and a Queen; that Madame de\r\nChevreuse, dissipated and carried away by passion, and cherishing the\r\nsame inclination for gallantry and idle vanity as hitherto, was no\r\nlonger worthy of her confidence; that she had brought good fortune to no\r\none; and that in lavishing wealth and honour upon the Duchess the debt\r\nof gratitude she owed her would be sufficiently discharged.\r\n\r\n    [2] Madame de Motteville, tom. i. p. 162.--\"Mauvais\r\n    accompagnements.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  ANNE OF AUSTRIA'S PRIME MINISTER AND HIS POLICY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAND now what was the actual position of Mazarin on succeeding to power\r\nin 1643?\r\n\r\nRichelieu had died admired and abhorred. The people, glad to be\r\ndelivered from so heavy a yoke, obeyed with joy the incipient rule of\r\nthe Queen-Regent. The courtiers were at first enchanted with a\r\nGovernment that refused nothing asked of it. It appeared, as one of the\r\nnumber said, that there were no more than five little words in the\r\nFrench language: \"_La reine est si bonne!_\"[1] The State prisons threw\r\nopen their gates; the rights of parliaments were respected; the princes\r\nof the blood and the great nobles were restored to their governorships.\r\nThere was for a season one unanimous concert of praise and thanksgiving.\r\nBut when the princes and parliaments were desirous, as before\r\nRichelieu's rule, of participating in the general direction of the\r\nState, and especially in the distribution of place and patronage, great\r\nwas the surprise of both at finding a steady resistance on the part of\r\nthe Queen-Regent. To see her manifest a disposition to govern without\r\nthem was looked upon as something scandalous. Every attempt she made\r\nthenceforward to retain a power which they evaded, or to repossess\r\nherself of that which she had imprudently suffered to escape from her\r\ngrasp, seemed to them nothing less than a continuation of the odious\r\nsystem of Richelieu. Their exasperation was increased to the highest\r\ndegree, therefore, when they beheld her give her entire confidence to a\r\nforeigner, to a Cardinal, to a creature of Richelieu. By that triple\r\ntitle Mazarin was equally hateful to the great nobles, the members of\r\nparliament, and the middle class. The tyranny of Richelieu had in the\r\nend attained to something noble by the high-handed heedlessness of all\r\nhis acts. If the people were to be trampled on, it was a species of\r\nconsolation that their oppressor was feared by others as well as\r\nthemselves. But that the oppression of the doomed French nation was to\r\nbe continued by a more ignoble hand was altogether intolerable.\r\nFrenchmen had begun to ask one another, who _was_ this Mazarin who had\r\ncome to rule over them? He could not--like Richelieu--boast of his high\r\nbirth, of descent from a long line of noble ancestors--Frenchmen. Poets\r\nand romancers, ye whose imaginations delight to dwell upon sudden\r\ndownfalls and rapid rises, mark well that little lad at play upon the\r\nSicilian shore near the town of Mazzara! Springing from the lowest of\r\nthe plebeian class, his family have not even a surname. He is the son of\r\none Pierre, a fisherman, whose humble hut stands yonder beneath the\r\ncliff. But a day will come when that lowly-born lad, joining his\r\nbaptismal name to that of the town which sheltered his cradle, will\r\nbecome Jules de Mazarin, robed in the Roman purple, quartering his\r\nshield with the consular fasces of Julius Caesar, governing France, and\r\nthrough her preparing and influencing the destinies of entire Europe.\r\n\r\n    [1] De Retz Memoirs, Petitot Collection.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, by easy steps that Richelieu's disciple and\r\nsuccessor obtained a firm grasp of that plenary power which the master\r\nmind of the former had consolidated and long wielded so grandly and\r\nterribly. The Queen herself at the commencement of the Regency had not\r\nyet renounced her former friendships. During a considerable portion of\r\nher married life Anne had impatiently endured the slights and\r\ndisparagements to which she was so long subjected, both by her husband\r\nand his Minister. Through engaging in divers dangerous and unsuccessful\r\nenterprises, she had been deprived of all influence, and was a queen\r\nonly in name. But, a woman and a Spaniard, she had descended to\r\ndissimulation, and in that \"ugly but necessary virtue\"[2] made rapid\r\nprogress. Up to the time of Richelieu's death she had played a double\r\ngame--made partisans in secret, with the object of subverting the\r\nCardinal's power, whilst feigning the semblance of friendship towards\r\nhim, and did not scruple to humiliate herself on occasions, in order to\r\ncarry her point. After that great man's decease, through rare patience,\r\ngreat caution, and a persistent line of conduct, she ultimately attained\r\nthat for which she had been willing to make any and every sacrifice--the\r\nRegency. During the King's last illness, the mistrusted Queen and wife\r\nhad profited by Mazarin's unhoped-for service, as Prime Minister, in\r\nprevailing over the unwillingness of the dying King to appoint her\r\ncustodian of his son, and Regent during his minority. She regarded this,\r\ntherefore, as a first and most important service on the part of Mazarin\r\ntowards her, and for which she felt proportionately grateful. Such was\r\nthe Cardinal's first stepping-stone to the good graces of Anne of\r\nAustria, and his twofold talent both as a laborious and indefatigable\r\nstatesman and a consummate courtier, speedily helped to secure for him\r\nher entire confidence. The singular personal resemblance he bore to that\r\ndesperate _enamorado_ of her early womanhood, the brilliant Buckingham,\r\nmay probably also have served him as a favourable prestige. On her\r\naccession to power Anne did not manifest much firmness of character.\r\nNaturally indolent, she disliked the drudgery attendant upon business\r\ndetails, and hence continued through convenience the services of a man\r\nwho, by taking off her hands the wearisome routine of State affairs,\r\nallowed her to reign at her ease.\r\n\r\n    [2] Madame de Motteville.\r\n\r\nMazarin, moreover, had never been displeasing to her. He had begun to\r\ningratiate himself during the month preceding the death of Louis\r\nXIII.,[3] and she named him Prime Minister about the middle of\r\nMay--partly through personal liking, but more through political\r\nnecessity. Far from appearing to resemble the impassive and imperious\r\nRichelieu, Anne perhaps might have recalled with agreeable emotion the\r\nwords of her deceased consort when he first presented Mazarin to her (in\r\n1639 or 1640)--\"He will please you, madame, because he bears a striking\r\nresemblance to Buckingham.\" By degrees the liking increased, and grew\r\nsufficiently strong to resist every assault from his enemies. At the\r\nsame time the Minister to whom the Queen owed so much, instead of\r\ndictating to and presuming to govern her, was ever at her feet, and\r\nprodigal of that attention, respect, and tenderness to which she had\r\nbeen hitherto a stranger.\r\n\r\n    [3] Louis died May 14th, 1643.\r\n\r\nIt is a delicate matter to investigate with exactitude the means by\r\nwhich Mazarin obtained entire sway over the Queen-Regent, and one which\r\nLa Rochefoucauld scarcely touches upon; but it is too interesting a\r\npoint in history to be left in the dark, and thereby to altogether\r\ndisregard that which first constituted the minister's strength, and\r\nsoon afterwards became the centre and key of the situation. After a long\r\nseason of oppression, regal powers and splendour gilded the hours of\r\nAnne of Austria, and her Spanish pride exacted the tribute of respect\r\nand homage. Mazarin was prodigal of both. He cast himself at her feet in\r\norder to reach her heart. In her heart of hearts she was not the less\r\ntouched by the grave accusation brought against him that he was a\r\nforeigner, for was not she also a foreigner? Perhaps that of itself\r\nproved the source of a mysterious attraction to her, and she may have\r\nfound it a singular pleasure to converse with her Prime Minister in her\r\nmother tongue as a compatriot and friend. To all this must be added the\r\nmind and manners of Mazarin--supple and insinuating, always master of\r\nhimself, of an unchangeable serenity amidst the gravest circumstances,\r\nfull of confidence in his good star, and diffusing that confidence\r\naround him. It must also be remembered that Cardinal although he was,\r\nMazarin was not a priest; that imbued with the maxims which formed the\r\ncode of gallantry of her native land, Anne of Austria had always loved\r\nto please the other sex; that she was then forty-one and still\r\nbeautiful, that her Prime Minister was of the same age, that he was\r\nexceedingly well-made and of a most pleasing countenance, in which\r\n_finesse_, was blended with a certain air of greatness. He had readily\r\nrecognised that without ancestry, establishment, or support in France,\r\nand surrounded by rivals and enemies, all his strength centred in the\r\nQueen. He applied himself therefore above all things to gain her heart,\r\nas Richelieu had tried before him; and as he happily possessed far other\r\nmeans for attaining success in that respect, the handsome and\r\ngentle-mannered Cardinal eventually succeeded. Once master of her heart,\r\nhe easily directed the mind of Anne of Austria, and taught her the\r\ndifficult art of pursuing ever the same end by the aid of conduct the\r\nmost diverse, according to the difference of circumstances.\r\n\r\nBut favourable and indeed gracious as his royal mistress had shown\r\nherself towards him personally, and apart from any particular line of\r\npolicy, at the outset of his premiership Mazarin had nevertheless to\r\ncontend against a formidable host of enemies; and not the least\r\nredoubtable among them might be reckoned that intrepid political heroine\r\nthe lately-banished Duchess de Chevreuse. No sooner did she again find\r\nherself at the side of Anne of Austria than the indefatigable Marie set\r\nto work with all her characteristic dash, spirit, and energy to attack\r\nRichelieu's system and its adherents, now directed by Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThe first point she sought to carry was the return of Chateauneuf to\r\noffice. \"The good sense and long experience of M. de Chateauneuf,\" says\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, \"were known to the Queen. He had undergone a rigorous\r\nimprisonment for his adhesion to her cause; he was firm, decisive, loved\r\nthe State, and more capable than anyone else of re-establishing the old\r\nform of government which Richelieu had first begun to destroy. Firmly\r\nattached to Mdme. de Chevreuse, she knew sufficiently-well how to govern\r\nhim. She therefore urged his return with much warmth.\" Chateauneuf had\r\nalready obtained as a royal boon that the \"rude and miserable condition\"\r\nof close incarceration under which he had groaned for ten years should\r\nbe changed for a compulsory residence at one of his country houses.\r\nMdme. de Chevreuse demanded the termination of this mitigated exile,\r\nthat she might once more behold him free who had endured such\r\nextremities for the Queen's sake and her own. Mazarin saw that he must\r\nyield, but only did so tardily, never appearing himself to repulse\r\nChateauneuf, but always alleging the paramount necessity of conciliating\r\nthe Conde family, and especially the Princess, who, as already said,\r\nbore bitter enmity towards him as the judge of her brother, Henri de\r\nMontmorency. Chateauneuf was therefore recalled, but with that\r\nreservation accorded to the last clause of the King's will, that he\r\nshould not appear at Court, but reside at his own house of Montrouge,\r\nnear Paris, where his friends might visit him.\r\n\r\nThe next step was to transfer him thence to some ministerial office.\r\nChateauneuf was no longer a young man, but neither his energy nor his\r\nambition had deserted him, and Mdme. de Chevreuse made it a point of\r\nhonour to reinstate him in the post of Keeper of the Seals, which he had\r\nformerly held and lost through her, and which all Queen Anne's old\r\nfriends now saw with indignation occupied by one of the most detested of\r\nRichelieu's creatures, Pierre Seguier. This last, however, was a man of\r\ncapacity--laborious, well-informed and full of resources. To these\r\nqualifications he added a remarkable suppleness, which made him very\r\nuseful and accommodating to a Prime Minister. He moreover had the\r\nsupport of friends who stood high in the Queen's favour, and was further\r\nstrengthened by the opposition of the Condes and the Bishop of Beauvais\r\nto Chateauneuf. The Duchess perceiving that it was almost impossible to\r\nsurmount so powerful an opposition, took another way of arriving at the\r\nsame end. She contented herself with asking for the lowest seat in the\r\ncabinet for her friend; well knowing that once installed therein,\r\nChateauneuf would soon manage all the rest and aggrandise his position.\r\n\r\nAt the same time that she strove to extricate from disgrace the man upon\r\nwhom rested all her political hopes, Madame de Chevreuse, not daring to\r\nattack Mazarin overtly, insensibly undermined the ground beneath his\r\nfeet, and step by step prepared his ruin. Her experienced eye enabled\r\nher promptly to perceive the most favourable point of attack whence to\r\nassail the Queen, and the watchword she passed was to fan and keep alive\r\nto the utmost the general feeling of reprobation which all the\r\nproscribed, on returning to France, had aroused and disseminated against\r\nthe memory of Richelieu. This feeling was universal--among the great\r\nfamilies he had decimated or despoiled;--in the Church, too firmly\r\nrepressed not to be unmindful of its abasement;--in the Parliament,\r\nstrictly confined to its judicial functions, and aspiring to break\r\nthrough such narrow limits. The same feeling was still alive in the\r\nQueen's bosom, who could not have forgotten the deep humiliation to\r\nwhich Richelieu had subjected her, and the fate for which he had\r\nprobably reserved her. These tactics succeeded, and on every side there\r\narose against the late violence and tyranny, and, by a rebound, against\r\nthe creatures of Richelieu, a storm so furious that Mazarin's utmost\r\nability was taxed to allay it.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse likewise supplicated Anne of Austria to repair the\r\nlong-endured misfortunes of the Vendome princes, by bestowing upon them\r\neither the Admiralty, to which an immense power was attached, or the\r\ngovernment of Brittany, which the head of the family, Caesar de Vendome,\r\nhad formerly held--deriving it alike from the hand of his father, Henry\r\nIV., and as the heritage of his father-in-law, the Duke de Mercoeur.\r\nThis was nothing less than demanding the aggrandisement of an unfriendly\r\nhouse, and at the same time the ruin of two families that had served\r\nRichelieu with the utmost devotion, and were best capable of supporting\r\nMazarin. The Minister parried the blow aimed at him by the Duchess by\r\ndint of address and patience, never refusing, always eluding, and\r\nsummoning to his aid his grand ally, as he termed it--Time. Before the\r\nreturn of Madame de Chevreuse he had found himself forced to win over\r\nthe Vendomes, and to secure them in his interest. On Richelieu's death\r\nhe had strenuously contributed to obtain their recall, and had since\r\nmade them every kind of advance; but he soon perceived that he could not\r\nsatisfy them without bringing about his own destruction. The Duke Caesar\r\nde Vendome, son of Henry IV. and _The Fair Gabrielle_, had early carried\r\nhis pretensions to a great height, and had shown himself restless and\r\nfactious as a legitimate prince. He had passed his life in revolts and\r\nconspiracies, and in 1641 had been compelled to flee to England through\r\nsuspicion of being implicated in an attempt to assassinate Richelieu. He\r\ndid not dare return to France until after the Cardinal's death; and, as\r\nmay well be imagined, he came back breathing the direst vengeance.\r\nAgainst the ambition of the Vendomes Mazarin skilfully opposed that of\r\nthe Condes, who were inimical to the aggrandisement of a house too\r\nnearly rivalling their own. But it was very difficult to retain Brittany\r\nin the hands of its newly-appointed governor, the Marshal La Meilleraie,\r\nin face of the claim of a son of Henry the Great, who had formerly held\r\nit, and demanded it back as a sort of heirloom. Mazarin therefore\r\nresigned himself to the sacrifice of La Meilleraie, but he lightened it\r\nas much as possible. He persuaded the Queen to assume to herself the\r\ngovernment of Brittany, and have only a lieutenant-general over it--a\r\npost, of course, beneath the dignity of the Vendomes, and which would,\r\ntherefore, remain in La Meilleraie's hands. The latter could not take\r\noffence at being second in power therein to the Queen; and to arrange\r\neverything to the entire satisfaction of a person of such importance,\r\nMazarin solicited for him soon afterwards the title of duke, which the\r\ndeceased King had, in fact, promised the Marshal, and the reversion of\r\nthe post of Grand Master of the Artillery for his son--that same son on\r\nwhom subsequently Mazarin bestowed, with his own name, the hand of his\r\nniece, the beautiful Hortense.\r\n\r\nMazarin was so much the less inclined to favour the house of Vendome\r\nfrom having encountered a dangerous rival in the Queen's good graces, in\r\nVendome's youngest son, Beaufort, a young, bold, and flourishing\r\ngallant, who displayed ostentatiously all the exterior signs of loyalty\r\nand chivalry, and affected for Anne of Austria a passionate devotion not\r\nlikely to be displeasing. \"He was tall, well-made, dexterous, and\r\nindefatigable in all warlike exercises,\" says La Rochefoucauld, \"but\r\nartificial withal, and wanting in truthfulness of character. Mentally he\r\nwas heavy and badly cultivated; nevertheless he attained his objects\r\ncleverly enough through the blunt coarseness of his manners. He was of\r\nhigh but unsteady courage, and was not a little envious and\r\nmalignant.\"[4] De Retz does not, like La Rochefoucauld, accuse Beaufort\r\nof artificiality, but represents him as presumptuous and of thorough\r\nincapacity. His portrait of him, though over-coloured, like most others\r\nfrom the coadjutor's pen, is sufficiently faithful, but at the\r\ncommencement of the Regency, the defects of the Duke de Beaufort had not\r\nfully declared themselves, and were less conspicuous than his good\r\nqualities. Some few days before her husband's death, Anne of Austria had\r\nplaced her children under his charge--a mark of confidence that so\r\nelated him that the young Duke conceived hopes which his impetuosity\r\nhindered him from sufficiently disguising. Indeed, these were presumed\r\nupon so far as to give offence to the Queen; and, as the height of\r\ninconsistency, he committed at the same time the egregious folly of\r\npublicly enacting the led-captain in the rosy chains of the handsome but\r\ndecried Duchess de Montbazon. It was only, however, by slow degrees that\r\nthe Queen's liking for him abated. At first, she had proposed to confer\r\nupon him the post of Grand-Ecuyer, vacant since the death of the\r\nunfortunate Cinq-Mars, which would have kept him in close attendance\r\nupon her, and was altogether a fitting appointment--for Beaufort had\r\nnothing of the statesman in him; with little intellect and no reticence,\r\nhe was also averse to steady application to business, and capable only\r\nof some bold and violent course of action. The Duke had the folly to\r\nrefuse this post of Grand-Ecuyer, hoping for a better; and then,\r\naltering his mind when it was too late, he solicited it only to incur\r\ndisappointment.[5] The more his favour diminished, the more his\r\nirritation increased, and it was not long ere he placed himself at the\r\nhead of the Cardinal's bitterest enemies.\r\n\r\n    [4] La Rochefoucauld.\r\n\r\n    [5] Mazarin himself has furnished this fact, otherwise unknown, in\r\n    one of his diaries (_Carnet_, pp. 72, 73). The Cardinal-Minister was\r\n    in the habit of jotting down the chief events of each day in these\r\n    small memorandum books (_Carnets_), which he kept in the pocket of\r\n    his cassock.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse hoped to be more fortunate in securing the\r\ngovernorship of Havre for a very different sort of person--for a man of\r\ntried devotedness and of a rare and subtle intellect--La Rochefoucauld.\r\nShe would thereby recompense the services rendered to the Queen and\r\nherself, strengthen and aggrandize one of the chiefs of the\r\n_Importants_, and weaken Mazarin by depriving of an important government\r\na person upon whom he had entire reliance--Richelieu's niece, the\r\nDuchess d'Aiguillon. The Cardinal succeeded in rendering this\r\nmanoeuvre abortive, without appearing to have any hand in it. And\r\nherein, as in many other matters, the art of Mazarin was to wear the\r\nsemblance of merely confirming the Queen in the resolves with which he\r\ninspired her.\r\n\r\nIn thus attributing these various designs, this connected and consistent\r\nline of conduct, to Madame de Chevreuse, we do not advance it as our own\r\nopinion, but as that of La Rochefoucauld, who must have been perfectly\r\nwell informed. He attributes it to her both in his own affairs and in\r\nthose of the Vendomes. Neither was Mazarin blind to the fact, for more\r\nthan once in his private notes we read these words:--\"My greatest\r\nenemies are the Vendomes and Madame de Chevreuse, who urges them on.\" He\r\ntells us also that she had formed the project of marrying her charming\r\ndaughter Charlotte, then sixteen, to the Vendome's eldest son, the Duke\r\nde Mercoeur, whilst his brother Beaufort should espouse the wealthy\r\nMademoiselle d'Epernon, who foiled these designs, and even greater\r\nstill, by throwing herself at four-and-twenty into a convent of\r\nCarmelites. These marriages, which would have reconciled, united, and\r\nstrengthened so many great houses, moderately attached to the Queen and\r\nher minister, terrified Richelieu's successor. He therefore sought to\r\nfoil them by every means in his power, and succeeded in prevailing upon\r\nthe Queen to frustrate them in an underhand way; having found that the\r\nunion of Mademoiselle de Vendome with the brilliant but restless Duke de\r\nNemours had caused him more than ordinary anxiety.\r\n\r\nIf the intricate details of those counter intrigues of Mazarin and\r\nMadame de Chevreuse be followed attentively, we are at a loss to say to\r\nwhich of the two antagonists the palm for skill, sagacity, and address\r\nshould be given. Whilst Mazarin was astute enough to make a certain\r\namount of sacrifice in order to reserve to himself the right of not\r\nmaking greater--treating everyone with apparent consideration, rendering\r\nno one desperate, promising much, holding back the least possible\r\n_proprio motu_ of himself, and surrounding Madame de Chevreuse herself\r\nwith attention and homage without suffering any illusion to beguile him\r\nas to the nature of her sentiments--she, on her part, paid him back in\r\nthe same coin. La Rochefoucauld says that during these _mollia tempora_,\r\nMadame de Chevreuse and Mazarin actually flirted with each other. The\r\nDuchess, who had always intermingled gallantry with politics, tried, as\r\nit appears, the power of her charms upon the Cardinal. The latter, on\r\nhis side, failed not to lavish honeyed words, and \"essayoit meme quelque\r\nfois de lui faire croire qu'elle lui donnoit de l'amour.\"[6] There were\r\nother ladies also, it seems, who would not have been sorry to please the\r\nhandsome First Minister a little. Amongst these might be numbered the\r\nPrincess de Guemene,[7] one of the greatest beauties of the French\r\nCourt, who, certainly, if only one half the stories related of her be\r\ntrue, was by no means of a ferocious disposition in affairs of\r\ngallantry. This lady, as well as her husband, were both favourable to\r\nMazarin, in spite of all the efforts of Madame de Montbazon, and Madame\r\nde Chevreuse, her sister-in-law. It may be readily imagined that Mazarin\r\ndevoted great attention to Madame de Guemene, and did not fail to pay\r\nher a host of compliments, as he did to Madame de Chevreuse; but as he\r\nwent no further, the two gay ladies were at a loss to conceive what so\r\nmany compliments coupled with so much reserve meant. They sometimes\r\nasked which of the two was really the object of his admiration; and as\r\nhe still made no further advances at the same time that he continued his\r\ngallant protestations, \"these ladies,\" says Mazarin, \"si esamina la mia\r\nvita e si conclude che io sia impotente.\"[8]\r\n\r\n    [6] La Rochefoucauld, Memoirs, p. 383.\r\n\r\n    [7] Anne de Rohan, wife of M. de Guemene, eldest son of the Duke de\r\n    Montbazon, and brother of Madame de Chevreuse.\r\n\r\n    [8] Carnet, iii. p. 39.\r\n\r\nPolitical intrigue had become such an affair of fashion among the Court\r\ndames of that day, that those of the highest rank made no scruple of\r\nbringing into play all the artillery of their wit and beauty whenever\r\nthey could contribute to the success of their enterprises. Still endowed\r\nwith those two potent gifts to an eminent degree, Madame de Chevreuse\r\nbrought all her various influences into perfect combination, and had\r\ngrown so passionately fond of the fierce excitement of conspiring, that\r\nlove was to her now merely a means and political victory the end. She\r\ndevoted literally her entire existence to it, living in the confidence\r\nand intimacy of the Vendomes and other noble perturbators of the hour.\r\nHer activity, her penetration, her energy obtained for her among the\r\nparty of the _Importants_ the importance she coveted. It was not long,\r\ntherefore, ere she begun to give Mazarin cause for grave anxiety. During\r\nthe encounters resulting from this strenuous antagonism, reconciliations\r\noccasionally took place, in which even the Cardinal's coldness,\r\ncaution, and his laborious occupation, could not, it is said, place him\r\nbeyond reach of the Duchess's irresistible fascinations. But the latter,\r\nwell aware that the _role_ of Mazarin's mistress would not give to her\r\ngrasp the helm of the State, which he reserved exclusively to himself,\r\npreferred, therefore, rather to remain his enemy, and figure at the head\r\nand front of the faction antagonistic to his government.\r\n\r\nThis flirting and skirmishing had gone on for some time, but at last\r\nnatural feeling prevailed over political reticence. Madame de Chevreuse\r\ngrew impatient at obtaining words only, and scarcely anything serious or\r\neffective. She had, it is true, received some money for her own use,\r\neither in repayment of that which she had formerly lent the Queen, or\r\nfor the discharge of debts contracted during exile and in the interest\r\nof Anne of Austria. On returning to Court, one of her earliest steps was\r\nto withdraw her friend and _protege_, Alexandre de Campion, from the\r\nservice of the Vendomes, and place him in a suitable position in the\r\nQueen's household. Chateauneuf had been reinstated in his former post of\r\nChancellor (_des Ordres du Roi_), and later his governorship of Touraine\r\nwas restored to him on the death of the Marquis de Gevres, who fell at\r\nthe siege of Thionville; but the Duchess considered that that was doing\r\nvery little for a man of Chateauneuf's merit--for him who had staked\r\nfortune and life, and undergone ten years' imprisonment. She readily\r\nperceived, therefore, that the perpetual delay of favours ever promised,\r\never deferred in the instances of the Vendomes and La Rochefoucauld,\r\nwere so many artifices of the Cardinal, and that she was his dupe. This\r\nconviction put the spirited partisan upon her mettle. She began to\r\ntitter, to mock, and to expostulate by turns, and sometimes twitted the\r\nminister in pert and derisive terms. This, however, betrayed a want of\r\nher ordinary precaution, and only served to fill Mazarin's quiver with\r\nshafts to be used against herself. He made the Queen believe that Madame\r\nde Chevreuse sought to rule her with a rod of iron; that she had changed\r\nher mask, but not her character; that she was ever the same impulsive\r\nand restless person, who, with all her talent and devotedness, had never\r\nworked aught but mischief around her, and was only instrumental in\r\nruining others as well as herself. By degrees, underhand and hidden as\r\nit might be, war between the Duchess and the Cardinal declared itself\r\nunmistakably. The commencement and progress of this curious struggle for\r\nsupremacy has been admirably depicted by La Rochefoucauld; and, while\r\nthe autograph memoranda of Mazarin cast a fresh flood of light upon it,\r\nthey enhance infinitely Madame de Chevreuse's ability by revealing to\r\nwhat an extent that Minister dreaded her.\r\n\r\nIn every page of these invaluable _carnets_ he indicates her as being\r\nthe head and mainspring of the _Importants_. \"It is Madame de\r\nChevreuse,\" he writes repeatedly, \"who stirs them all up. She endeavours\r\nto strengthen the hands of the Vendomes; she tries to win over every\r\nmember of the house of Lorraine; she has already gained the Duke de\r\nGuise, and through him she strives to carry away from me the Duke\r\nd'Elbeuf.\" \"She sees clearly through everything; she has guessed very\r\naccurately that it is I who have secretly persuaded the Queen to hinder\r\nthe restoration of the government of Brittany to the Duke de Vendome.\r\nShe has said so to her father, the Duke de Montbazon, and to Montagu.\r\nShe has quarrelled with Montagu, in fact, because he raises an obstacle\r\nto Chateauneuf by supporting Seguier.\" \"Nothing discourages Madame de\r\nChevreuse; she entreats the Vendomes to have patience, and sustains them\r\nby promising a speedy change of scene.\" \"Madame de Chevreuse never\r\nrelinquishes the hope of displacing me. The reason she gives for this\r\nis, that when the Queen refused to put Chateauneuf at the head of the\r\ngovernment, she stated that she could not do it immediately, as she must\r\nhave some consideration for me, whence Madame de Chevreuse concludes\r\nthat the Queen has much esteem and liking for Chateauneuf, and that when\r\nI shall be no longer where I am, the post is secured for her friend.\r\nHence the hopes and illusions with which they are buoyed up.\" \"The\r\nDuchess and her friends assert that the Queen will shortly send for\r\nChateauneuf; and by so doing they abuse the minds of all, and prompt\r\nthose who are looking to their future interests to pay court to her and\r\nseek her friendship. They make an excuse for the Queen's delay in giving\r\nhim my place, by saying that she has still need of me for some short\r\ntime.\" \"I am told that Madame de Chevreuse secretly directs Madame de\r\nVendome (a pious person who has great influence over the bishops and\r\nconvents), and gives her instructions, in order that she may not fall\r\ninto error, and that all the machinery used against me may thoroughly\r\nanswer its purpose.\" From this last entry it is clear that Madame de\r\nChevreuse, without being in the smallest degree possible a _devote_,\r\nknew right well how to make use of the _parti devot_, which then\r\nexercised great influence over Anne of Austria's mind, and gave serious\r\nuneasiness to Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister's chief difficulty was to make Queen Anne--the sister\r\nof the King of Spain, and herself of a piety thoroughly\r\nSpanish--understand that it was necessary, notwithstanding the\r\nengagements which she had so often contracted, notwithstanding the\r\ninstances of the Court of Rome and those of the heads of the episcopate,\r\nto continue the alliance with the Protestants of Germany and Holland,\r\nand to persist in only consenting to a _general_ peace in which the\r\nallies of France should equally find their account as well as that\r\ncountry itself. On the other side, it was continually dinned into the\r\nQueen's ear that it was practicable to make a separate treaty of peace,\r\nand negotiate singly with Spain on very fitting conditions, that by such\r\nmeans the scandal of an impious war between \"the very Christian\" and\r\n\"the very Catholic\" King would cease, and a relief be afforded to France\r\nvery much needed. Such was the policy of the Queen's old friends. It was\r\nat least specious, and reckoned numerous partisans among men the most\r\nintelligent and attached to the interests of their country. Mazarin, the\r\ndisciple and successor of Richelieu, had higher views, but which it was\r\nnot easy at first to make Anne of Austria comprehend. By degrees,\r\nhowever, he succeeded, thanks to his judicious efforts, renewed\r\nincessantly and with infinite art; thanks especially to the victories of\r\nthe Duke d'Enghien--for in all worldly affairs success is a very\r\neloquent and right persuasive advocate. The Queen, however, remained for\r\na considerable interval undecided, and it may be seen by Mazarin's own\r\nmemoranda that during the latter part of May, as well as through the\r\nwhole of June and July, the Cardinal's greatest effort was to induce the\r\nRegent not to abandon her allies, but to firmly carry on the war. Madame\r\nde Chevreuse, with Chateauneuf, defended the old party policy, and\r\nstrove to bring over Anne of Austria to it. \"Madame de Chevreuse,\" wrote\r\nMazarin, \"causes the Queen to be told from all quarters that I do not\r\nwish for peace, that I hold the same maxims as Cardinal Richelieu on the\r\npoint--that it is both easy and necessary to make a separate treaty of\r\npeace.\" On several occasions he made indignant protestation against such\r\narrangement, pointing out the danger with which it was fraught, and that\r\nit would render ineffectual those sacrifices which France had for so\r\nmany years made. \"Madame de Chevreuse,\" he exclaimed, \"would ruin\r\nFrance!\" He knew well that, intimately associated with Gaston, her old\r\naccomplice in all the plots framed against Richelieu, she had won him\r\nover to the idea of a separate peace by holding out the hope of a\r\nmarriage between his daughter Mademoiselle de Montpensier and the\r\nArch-duke, which would have brought him the government of the Low\r\nCountries. He knew that she had preserved all her influence with the\r\nDuke de Lorraine; he knew, in fine, that she boasted of having the power\r\nof promptly negotiating a peace through the mediation of the Queen of\r\nSpain, who was at her disposal. Thus informed, he entreated his royal\r\nmistress to reject all Madame de Chevreuse's propositions, and to tell\r\nher plainly that she would not listen to anything relating to a separate\r\ntreaty, that she was decided upon not separating herself from her\r\nallies, that she desired a general peace, that with such view she had\r\nsent her ministers to Munster, who were then negotiating that important\r\nmatter, and that it was superfluous to speak to her any more upon the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThough baffled on these different points, Madame de Chevreuse did not\r\nconsider herself vanquished. She rallied and emboldened her adherents by\r\nher lofty spirit and firm resolution. The party feud went on--intrigues\r\nwere multiplied--but up to the close of August, 1643, no change had\r\ntaken place, though the acrimony of party feeling had become largely\r\nincreased. Finding that she had fruitlessly employed insinuation,\r\nflattery, artifice, and every species of Court manoeuvre, her daring\r\nmind did not shrink from the idea of having recourse to other means of\r\nsuccess. She kept up a brisk agitation amongst the bishops and devotees,\r\nshe continued to weave her political plots with the chiefs of the\r\n_Importants_, and at the same time she formed a closer intimacy with\r\nthat small cabal which formed in some sort the advance-guard of that\r\nparty, composed of men reared amongst the old conspiracies, accustomed\r\nto and always ready for _coups de main_, who had of old embarked in more\r\nthan one desperate enterprise against Richelieu, and who, in an\r\nextremity, might be likewise launched against Mazarin. The memoirs of\r\nthe time, and especially those of De Retz and La Rochefoucauld, make us\r\nsufficiently well acquainted with their names and characters. The former\r\nmistress of Chalais found little difficulty in acquiring sole sway over\r\na faction composed of second-rate talents. She caressed it skilfully;\r\nand, with the art of an experienced conspirator, she fomented every germ\r\nof false honour, of quintessential devotedness, and extravagant\r\nrashness. Mazarin, who, like Richelieu, had an admirable police,\r\nforewarned of Madame de Chevreuse's machinations, fully comprehended the\r\ndanger with which he was menaced. No one could have been better informed\r\nas to his exact position than the Cardinal: and the plans of the Duchess\r\nand the chiefs of the _Importants_ developed themselves clearly under\r\nMazarin's sharp-sightedness--either by their incessant and\r\nelaborately-concerted intrigues with the Queen, to force her to abandon\r\na minister to whose policy she had not yet openly declared her adhesion,\r\nor, should it prove necessary, treat that minister as De Luynes had done\r\nthe last Queen-mother's favourite d'Ancre, and as Montresor, Barriere,\r\nand Saint-Ybar would have served Richelieu. The first plan not having\r\nsucceeded, they began to think seriously about carrying out the second,\r\nand Madame de Chevreuse, the strongest mind of the party, proposed with\r\nsome show of reason to act before the return of the young hero of\r\nRocroy, the Duke d'Enghien; for that victorious soldier once in Paris\r\nwould unquestionably shield Mazarin. It became necessary, therefore, to\r\nprofit by his absence in order to strike a decisive blow. Success seemed\r\ncertain, and even easy. They were sure of having the people with them,\r\nwho, exhausted by a long war and groaning under taxation, would\r\nnaturally welcome with delight the hope of peace and repose. They might\r\nreckon on the declared support of the parliament, burning to recover\r\nthat importance in the State of which it had been deprived by Richelieu,\r\nand which was then a matter of dispute with Mazarin. They had all the\r\nsecret, even overt sympathy of the episcopate, which, with Rome,\r\ndetested the Protestant alliance, and demanded the restoration of that\r\nof Spain. The eager concurrence of the aristocracy could not be doubted\r\nfor a moment; which ever regretted its old and turbulent independence,\r\nand whose most illustrious representatives, the Vendomes, the Guises,\r\nthe Bouillons, and the La Rochefoucaulds were strenously opposed to the\r\ndomination of a foreign favourite, without fortune, of no birth, and as\r\nyet without fame. The princes of the blood resigned themselves to\r\nMazarin rather than to liking him. The Duke d'Orleans was not remarkable\r\nfor great fidelity to his friends, and the politic Prince de Conde\r\nlooked twice ere he quarrelled with the successful. He coaxed all\r\nparties, whilst he clung to his own interests. His son, doubtless, would\r\nfollow in his father's footsteps, and he would be won over by being\r\noverwhelmed with honours. The day following that on which the blow\r\nshould be struck there would be no resistance to their ascendancy, and\r\non the very day itself scarcely any obstacle. The Italian regiments of\r\nMazarin were with the army; there were scarcely any other troops in\r\nParis save the regiments of the guards, the colonels of which were\r\nnearly all devoted to the _Importants_. The Queen herself had not yet\r\nrenounced her former friendships. Her prudent reserve even was wrongly\r\ninterpreted. As it was her desire to appease and deal gently on all\r\nhands, she gave kind words to everybody, and those kind words were taken\r\nas tacit encouragement. Anne had not hitherto shown much firmness of\r\ncharacter; a certain amount of liking for the Cardinal was not unjustly\r\nimputed to her, and undue significance already attributed to the\r\nsteadily increasing attachment of a few short months.\r\n\r\nMazarin, on his own part, indulged in no illusions. He was decidedly not\r\nyet master of Anne of Austria's heart; since at that moment--that is to\r\nsay, during the month of July, 1643--in his most secret notes he\r\ndisplays a deep inquietude and despondency. The dissimulation of which\r\neverybody accused the Queen obviously terrified him, and we see him\r\npassing through all the alternations of hope and fear. It is very\r\ncurious to trace and follow out the varied fluctuations of his mind. In\r\nhis official letters to ambassadors and generals he affects a security\r\nwhich he does not feel. With his own intimate friends he permits some\r\nhint of his perplexities to escape him, but in his private memoranda\r\nthey are all laid bare. We therein read his inmost carks and cares, and\r\nhis passionate entreaties that the Queen-Regent would open her mind to\r\nhim. He feigns the utmost disinterestedness towards her; he simply asks\r\nto make way for Chateauneuf, if she has any secret preference for that\r\nminister. The ambiguous conduct of the Regent harasses and distresses\r\nhim, and he conjures her either to permit him to retire or to declare\r\nherself in favour of his policy.\r\n\r\nThis exciting contest continued with the keenest activity, but no change\r\nhad occurred up to the end of July, and even the first days of August,\r\n1643, though this critical state of affairs had become greatly\r\naggravated. The violence of the _Importants_ increased daily; the Queen\r\ndefended her minister, but she also showed consideration for his\r\nenemies. She hesitated to take the decided attitude which Mazarin\r\nrequired at her hands, not only in his individual interest, but in that\r\nof his government. Suddenly an incident, very insignificant apparently,\r\nbut which by assuming larger proportions brought about the inevitable\r\ncrisis--forced the Queen to declare herself, and Madame de Chevreuse to\r\nplunge deeper into a baleful enterprise, the idea of which had already\r\nforced itself upon her imagination. A great scandal occurred. We allude\r\nto a quarrel between the two duchesses, de Longueville and de\r\nMontbazon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE DUCHESS DE MONTBAZON.--THE AFFAIR OF THE DROPPED LETTERS.--THE\r\n  QUARREL OF THE TWO DUCHESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nON declaring itself of the party of Mazarin, the house of Conde had\r\ndrawn down the hatred of the _Importants_, though their hostility\r\nscarcely fell upon Madame de Longueville. Her gentleness in everything\r\nin which her heart was not seriously engaged, her entire indifference to\r\npolitics at this period of her life, with the graces of her mind and\r\nperson, rendered her pleasing to every one, and shielded her from party\r\nspite. But apart from affairs of State, she had an enemy, and a\r\nformidable enemy, in the Duchess de Montbazon. We have said that Madame\r\nde Montbazon had been the mistress of the Duke de Longueville, and as\r\none of the principal personages of the drama we are about to relate, she\r\nrequires to be somewhat better known.\r\n\r\nWe shall pass over in silence many of her foibles, without attempting to\r\nexcuse any. Before sketching her life, or at least a portion of it, it\r\nwill be necessary, in order to protect her memory against an excess of\r\nseverity, to recall certain traditions and examples for which unhappily\r\nher family was notorious.\r\n\r\nDaughter of Claude de Bretagne, Baron d'Avangour, she was on her\r\nmother's side granddaughter of that very complaisant Marquis de La\r\nVarenne Fouquet, who, successively scullion, cook, and maitre d'hotel of\r\nHenry the Fourth, \"gained more by carrying the amorous King's _poulets_\r\nthan basting those in his kitchen.\" Catherine Fouquet, Countess de\r\nVertus, his daughter, Madame de Montbazon's mother, was beautiful,\r\nwitty, somewhat giddy, and very gallant. Impatient of all hindrance, she\r\nhad authorised one of her lovers to assassinate her husband; but it was\r\nthe husband who assassinated the lover. The tragical termination of this\r\nrencontre does not seem to have cast a gloom over the life of the\r\nCountess de Vertus, for at seventy she began to learn to dance, and when\r\nseventy-three, married a young man over head and ears in debt.\r\n\r\nIn 1628, Marie d'Avangour quitted her convent to espouse Hercule de\r\nRohan, Duke de Montbazon, who was the father, by his first marriage, of\r\nMadame de Chevreuse and of the Prince de Guemene. She was sixteen, and\r\nhe sixty-one. Thorough fool as he was, the Duke did not conceal from\r\nhimself, it is said, the conviction that such an union was fraught with\r\nsome danger to him; but we may venture to affirm that he could not have\r\nforeseen all its dangers. Full of respect for the virtues of Marie de'\r\nMedicis, he recommended her example to his wife; then, with every\r\nconfidence in the future, he conducted her to Court.\r\n\r\nIn beauty the daughter was worthy of the mother, but in vices she left\r\nher far behind. Tallemant says she was one of the loveliest women\r\nimaginable. Her mind was not her most brilliant side, and the little\r\nthat she had was turned to intrigue and perfidy. \"Her mind,\" says the\r\nindulgent Madame de Motteville, \"was not so fine as her person; her\r\nbrilliancy was limited to her eyes, which commanded love. She claimed\r\nuniversal admiration.\" In regard to her character, all are unanimous. De\r\nRetz, who knew her well, speaks of her in these terms: \"Madame de\r\nMontbazon was a very great beauty. Modesty was wanting in her air. Her\r\njargon might, during a dull hour, have supplied the defects of her mind.\r\nShe showed but little faith in gallantry, none in business. She loved\r\nher own pleasure alone, and above her pleasure her interest. I never saw\r\na person who, in vice, preserved so little respect for virtue.\"\r\nSupremely vain and passionately fond of money, it was by the aid of her\r\nbeauty that she sought influence and fortune. She, therefore, took\r\ninfinite care of it, as of her idol, as of her resources, her treasure.\r\nShe kept it in repair, heightened it by all sorts of artifices, and\r\npreserved it almost uninjured till her death. Madame de Motteville\r\nasserts that, during the latter part of her life, she was as full of\r\nvanity as if she were but twenty-five years of age; that she had the\r\nsame desire to please, and that she wore her mourning garb in so\r\ncharming a manner, that \"the order of nature seemed changed, since age\r\nand beauty could be found united.\" Ten years before, in 1647, at the age\r\nof thirty-five, when Mazarin gave a comedy in the Italian style, that\r\nis, an opera, there was in the evening a grand ball, and the Duchess de\r\nMontbazon was present, adorned with pearls, with a red feather on her\r\nhead, and so dazzling in her appearance that the whole company was\r\ncompletely charmed. We can imagine what she was in 1643, at the age of\r\nthirty-one.\r\n\r\nOf the two conditions of perfect beauty--strength and grace, Madame\r\nde Montbazon possessed the first in the highest degree. She was tall\r\nand majestic, and she had all the charms of embonpoint. Her throat\r\nreminded one of the fulness, in this particular, of the antique\r\nstatues--exceeding them, perhaps, somewhat. What struck the beholder\r\nmost were her eyes and hair of intense blackness, upon a skin of the\r\nmost dazzling white. Her defect was a nose somewhat too prominent, with\r\na mouth so large as to give her face an appearance of severity. It will\r\nbe seen that she was the very opposite of Madame de Longueville. The\r\nlatter was tall, but not to excess. The richness of her form did not\r\ndiminish its delicacy. A moderate embonpoint exhibited, in full and\r\nexquisite measure, the beauty of the female form. Her eyes were of the\r\nsoftest blue; her hair of the most beautiful blonde. She had the most\r\nmajestic air, and yet her peculiar characteristic was grace. To these\r\nwere added the great difference of manners and tone. Madame de\r\nLongueville was, in her deportment, dignity, politeness, modesty,\r\nsweetness itself, with a languor and nonchalance which formed not her\r\nleast charm. Her words were few, as well as her gestures; the inflexions\r\nof her voice were a perfect music.[1] The excess, into which she never\r\nfell, might have been a sort of fastidiousness. Everything in her was\r\nwit, sentiment, charm. Madame de Montbazon, on the contrary, was free of\r\nspeech, bold and easy in her tone, full of stateliness and pride.\r\n\r\n    [1] Villefore, p. 32.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess was, nevertheless, a very attractive creature when she\r\ndesired to be so, and such we must conceive her to have been if we would\r\ntake account of the admiration she excited, and not exactly like the\r\nperson which Cousin represents her when, at the age of nearly forty, she\r\nhad become \"a Colossus\"--to use Tallemant's phrase. At the same time it\r\nis true that, even in youth, she had less grace than strength, less\r\ndelicacy than majesty. It is also true that she was free of speech, and\r\nin tone was bold and offhand; but those very defects for which she was\r\nremarkable only the better assured her empire over what, in modern\r\nparlance, would be termed the \"fast\" portion of the Court, and the\r\nsentiments to which she gave utterance revealed the most singular\r\nextravagance. But not a single voice protested when the Duke\r\nd'Hocquincourt proclaimed her _la belle des belles_. In the eyes of the\r\nforeigner she was the marvel which the generals who dreamed of the\r\ncapture of Paris coveted; in other words, she was _par excellence_ \"the\r\nbooty\" most desirable, on the subject of which the Duke of Weimar\r\nperpetrated a thoroughly German joke, which we must be pardoned for not\r\nrepeating: Anne of Austria might have smiled at it without blushing, but\r\nit is too gross to risk raising a laugh by its repetition in our days.\r\n\r\nShe had a great number of adorers, and of happy adorers, from Gaston\r\nDuke of Orleans, and the Count de Soissons, slain at Marfee, to Rance,\r\nthe young and gallant editor of Anacreon, and the future founder of La\r\nTrappe. M. de Longueville had been for some time her lover by title, and\r\nhe afforded her considerable advantages. When he married Mademoiselle de\r\nBourbon, Madame the Princess exacted--without, however, being very\r\nfaithfully obeyed--the discontinuance of all intercourse with his old\r\nmistress. Hence, in that interested soul, an irritation, which wounded\r\nvanity redoubled, when she saw this young bride, with her great name,\r\nher marvellous mind, her indefinable charms, advance into the world of\r\ngallantry, without the least effort draw after her all hearts, and take\r\npossession of, or at least share that empire of beauty of which she was\r\nso proud, and which was to her so precious. On the other hand, the Duke\r\nde Beaufort had not been able to restrain a passionate admiration for\r\nMadame de Longueville, which had been very coldly received. He was\r\nwounded by it, and his wound bled for a long time, as his friend, La\r\nChatre, informs us,[2] even after he had transferred his homage to\r\nMadame de Montbazon. The latter, as may be easily imagined, was again\r\nexasperated. Finally, the Duke de Guise, recently arrived in Paris,\r\nplaced himself in the party of the _Importants_ and at the service of\r\nMadame de Montbazon, who received him very favourably, at the same time\r\nshe was striving to keep or recall the Duke de Longueville, and that she\r\nwas ruling Beaufort, whose office near her was somewhat that of a\r\n_cavalier servente_. Thus it will be seen that Madame de Montbazon\r\ndisposed through Beaufort and through Guise, as through her\r\ndaughter-in-law Madame de Chevreuse, of the house of Vendome and that of\r\nLorraine, and she employed all this influence to the profit of her\r\nhatred against Madame de Longueville. She burned to injure her, and was\r\nnot long in finding an opportunity of doing it.\r\n\r\n    [2] Memoires of La Chatre. Petitot Collection, vol. li. p. 230.\r\n\r\nOne day when a numerous company was assembled in her salon, one of her\r\nyoung lady friends picked up a couple of letters which had been dropped\r\non the floor, bearing no signatures, but in a feminine handwriting, and\r\nof a somewhat equivocal style. They were read, and a thousand jokes\r\nperpetrated concerning them, and some effort made to discover the\r\nauthor. They were from a woman who wrote tenderly to some one whom she\r\ndid not hate. Madame de Montbazon pretended that they had fallen from\r\nthe pocket of Maurice de Coligny, who had just gone out, and that they\r\nwere in the handwriting of Madame de Longueville. The word of command\r\nthus once given, the Duke de Beaufort was amongst the first to spread\r\nthe insinuation which was a calumny, all the echoes of the party of the\r\n_Importants_ took it up, and Madame de Montbazon herself found pleasure\r\nin repeating it during several following days, so that the incident\r\nbecame the entertainment of the Court. A frivolous curiosity has very\r\nfaithfully preserved the text of the two letters thus found at the\r\nDuchess's house.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] Memoires of Madlle. de Montpensier, vol. i. pp. 62, 63.\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n     \"I should much more regret the change in your conduct if I\r\n     thought myself less worthy of a continuation of your\r\n     affection. I confess to you that so long as I believed it to\r\n     be true and warm, mine gave you all the advantages which you\r\n     could desire. Now, hope nothing more from me than the esteem\r\n     which I owe to your discretion. I have too much pride to\r\n     share the passion which you have so often sworn to me, and I\r\n     desire to punish your negligence in seeing me, in no other\r\n     way than by depriving you entirely of my society. I request\r\n     that you will visit me no more, since I have no longer the\r\n     power of commanding your presence.\"\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n     \"To what conclusion have you come after so long a silence?\r\n     Do you not know that the same pride which rendered me\r\n     sensible to your past affection forbids me to endure the\r\n     false appearances of its continuation! You say that my\r\n     suspicions and my inequalities render you the most unhappy\r\n     person in the world. I assure you that I believe no such\r\n     thing, although I cannot deny that you have perfectly loved\r\n     me, as you must confess that my esteem has worthily\r\n     recompensed you. So far we have done each other justice, and\r\n     I am determined not to have in the end less goodness, if\r\n     your conduct responds to my intentions. You would find them\r\n     less unreasonable if you had more passion, and the\r\n     difficulties of seeing me would only augment instead of\r\n     diminishing it. I suffer for loving too much, and you for\r\n     not loving enough. If I must believe you, let us exchange\r\n     humours. I shall find repose in doing my duty, and you in\r\n     doing yours, and you must fail in doing yours, in order to\r\n     obtain liberty. I do not perceive that I forget the manner\r\n     in which I passed the winter with you, and that I speak to\r\n     you as frankly as I have heretofore done. I hope that you\r\n     will make as good use of it, and that I shall not regret\r\n     being overcome in the resolution which I have made to return\r\n     to it no more. I shall remain at home for three or four days\r\n     in succession, and will be seen only in the evening: you\r\n     know the reason.\"\r\n\r\nThese letters were not forgeries. They had been really written by\r\nMadame de Fouquerolles to the handsome and elegant Marquis de\r\nMaulevrier, who had been silly enough to drop them in Madame de\r\nMontbazon's _salon_. Maulevrier, trembling at being discovered, and at\r\nhaving compromised Madame de Fouquerolles, ran to La Rochefoucauld, who\r\nwas his friend, confided to him his secret, and begged him to undertake\r\nto hush up the affair. La Rochefoucauld made Madame de Montbazon\r\nunderstand that it was for her interest to be generous on this occasion,\r\nfor the error or fraud would be easily recognised as soon as the writing\r\nshould be compared with that of Madame de Longueville. Madame de\r\nMontbazon placed the original letters in the hands of La Rochefoucauld,\r\nwho showed them to M. the Prince and to Madame the Princess, to Madame\r\nde Rambouillet, and to Madame Sable, particular friends of Madame de\r\nLongueville, and, the truth being well established, burned them in the\r\npresence of the Queen, delivering Maulevrier and Madame de Fouquerolles\r\nfrom the terrible anxiety into which they had been for some time thrown.\r\n\r\nThe house of Conde felt a lively resentment at the insult offered to it.\r\nThe Duke and Duchess de Longueville desired, it is true, the one by a\r\nsentiment of interested prudence, the other by a just feeling of\r\ndignity, to take no further notice of the matter. But the Princess,\r\nimpelled by her high spirit, and still intoxicated by her son's success,\r\nexacted a reparation equal to the offence, and declared loudly that, if\r\nthe Queen and the government did not defend the honour of her house, she\r\nand all her family would withdraw from the Court. She was indignant at\r\nthe mere idea of placing her daughter in the scales with the\r\ngranddaughter of a cook. In vain did the whole party of the\r\n_Importants_, with Beaufort and Guise at their head, agitate and\r\nthreaten; in vain did Madame de Chevreuse, who had not yet lost all her\r\ninfluence with the Queen, strive earnestly in behalf of her\r\nmother-in-law. It did not suffice for the resentment of the Princess and\r\nthe Duke d'Enghien that Madame de Longueville's innocence was fully\r\nrecognised; they demanded a public reparation. Madame de Motteville has\r\nleft us an amusing recital of the \"mummeries,\" as she terms them, of\r\nwhich she was a witness.\r\n\r\nThe Queen was in her state cabinet and the Princess beside her, in great\r\nemotion and looking very fierce, declaring the affair to be nothing less\r\nthan the crime of high treason. Madame de Chevreuse, interested for a\r\nthousand reasons in the quarrel of her mother-in-law, was busy with\r\nCardinal Mazarin arranging the composition of the apology to be made. At\r\nevery word there was a _pour-parler_ of half an hour. The Cardinal went\r\nfrom one side to the other to accommodate the difference, as if such a\r\npeace was necessary for the welfare of France, and his own in\r\nparticular. It was arranged that the criminal should present herself at\r\nthe Princess's hotel on the morrow.\r\n\r\nThe apology was written upon a small piece of paper and attached to her\r\nfan, in order that she might repeat it word for word to the Princess.\r\nShe did it in the most haughty manner possible, assuming an air which\r\nseemed to say, \"I jest in every word I utter.\"\r\n\r\nMademoiselle de Montpensier gives us the two speeches made upon the\r\noccasion. \"Madame, I come here to protest to you that I am innocent of\r\nthe wickedness of which I have been accused: no person of honour could\r\nutter a calumny such as this. If I had committed a like fault, I should\r\nhave submitted to any punishment which it might have pleased the Queen\r\nto inflict upon me; I should never have shown myself again in the\r\nworld, and would have asked your pardon. I beg you to believe that I\r\nshall never fail in the respect which I owe to you and in the opinion\r\nwhich I have of the virtue and of the merit of Madame de\r\nLongueville.\"[4] That lady was not present at the ceremony, and her\r\nmother, to whom the Duchess addressed herself, made a very short and dry\r\nreply. This reconciliation did not deceive any one of those present; it\r\nwas, in fact, only a fresh declaration of war.\r\n\r\n    [4] Memoires, vol. i. p. 65.\r\n\r\nBesides the satisfaction which she had just obtained, the Princess had\r\nasked and had been permitted the privilege of never associating with the\r\nDuchess de Montbazon. Some time after, Madame de Chevreuse invited the\r\nQueen to a collation in the public garden of Renard. This was then the\r\nrendezvous of the best society. It was at the termination of the\r\nTuileries, near the Porte de la Conference, which abutted on the _Cours\r\nde la Reine_. In the summer, on returning from the _Cours_, which was\r\nthe \"Rotten Row\" of the day, and the spot where the beauties of the time\r\nexercised their powers, it was customary to stop at the garden Renard\r\nfor the purpose of taking refreshments, and to listen to serenades\r\nperformed after the Spanish fashion. The Queen took pleasure in visiting\r\nthis place during fine summer evenings. She desired Madame the Princess\r\nto partake with her the collation offered by Madame de Chevreuse,\r\nassuring her at the same time that Madame de Montbazon would not be\r\npresent; but the latter person was really there, and even pretended to\r\ndo the honours of the collation as mother-in-law of the lady who gave\r\nit. The Princess wished to withdraw, in order that the entertainment\r\nmight not be disturbed: the Queen had no right whatever to detain her.\r\nShe, therefore, begged Madame de Montbazon to pretend sickness, and by\r\nleaving the party, to relieve her from embarrassment. The haughty\r\nDuchess would not consent to fly before her enemy, and kept her place.\r\nThe Queen, offended, refused the collation and quitted the promenade. On\r\nthe morrow an order from the King enjoined upon Madame de Montbazon to\r\nleave Paris. This disgrace irritated the _Importants_. They thought\r\nthemselves humiliated and enfeebled, and there were no violent or\r\nextreme measures which they did not contemplate. The Duke de Beaufort,\r\nsmitten at once in his influence and his love, uttered loud\r\ndenunciations, and it was reported that a plot had been formed against\r\nthe life of Mazarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE IMPORTANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is necessary, at this juncture, to have a just idea of the general\r\nposition of political affairs in France, as well as of the attitude of\r\nthe faction known as the _Importants_, who were then most active in\r\nopposing the government of Mazarin, in order to understand clearly the\r\ngravity of an incident which otherwise in itself might seem to be of\r\nlittle consequence.\r\n\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, the historian of that party, has made us tolerably\r\nfamiliar with the men who composed it. They were a band of eccentric and\r\nmischievous spirits, bold of heart, ready of hand, and of boundless\r\nfidelity to one another. Professing to hold the most outrageous maxims,\r\nincessantly invoking Brutus and old Rome, and intermingling gallant with\r\npolitical intrigues, they suffered themselves to be hurried beyond the\r\nbounds of reason through a Quixotic idea of always pleasing the ladies.\r\nThey had all been more or less fellow-sufferers with Anne of Austria\r\nduring the period of her affliction and persecution by Richelieu, and\r\nfrom the commencement of her Regency, these returning exiles and\r\nliberated prisoners had been gathering round her until at last, formed\r\ninto a faction, they gave themselves out as the Queen's party, and by\r\nadopting a high-flown, turgid, and mysterious style of phraseology, and\r\nassuming bombastic and braggart airs of authority, coupled with an\r\naffectation of capacity and profundity, obtained for themselves from the\r\nwits of the Court and city the nickname of _The Importants_, under which\r\nthey figured until absorbed a few years later in the more general and\r\npopular designation of _Frondeurs_. Their favourite chief was the Duke\r\nde Beaufort, of whom we have already spoken as possessing very nearly\r\nthe same characteristics as the rest--at once artificial and\r\nextravagant, with great pretensions to loyalty and patriotism,\r\nprofessing to be a man of independent action, but in fact wholly ruled\r\nby Madame de Montbazon, who, in her turn, was swayed by the Duchess de\r\nChevreuse.\r\n\r\nOn the sudden disappearance from Paris of one of the most distinguished\r\nof the lady leaders of the _Importants_--like a star of the first\r\nmagnitude fallen from their system--the entire party was thrown into\r\ncommotion, whilst the more intimate friends and admirers of the banished\r\nbeauty raised a fierce outcry. Such an open disgrace of the young and\r\nbeautiful Duchess sorely irritated her restless partisans. They\r\nconsidered themselves humiliated and weakened by it, and there was no\r\nviolence or extremity to which they were not prepared to resort. Her\r\nslave and adorer, the Duke de Beaufort, assailed at once on the score of\r\nhis political interest and personal gallantry, vapoured and stormed\r\nfuriously. Thoughts of vengeance, which, like the mutterings of an\r\napproaching tempest, had begun to brood beneath the roof of the Hotel de\r\nVendome, now became concentrated in a plot to get rid of Mazarin by fair\r\nmeans or foul, divers modes of its execution being earnestly discussed.\r\n\r\nIn such conjunctures, the Cardinal rose to the level of Richelieu. At\r\nthe same time he had to secure safety and success mainly through his own\r\ncourage and patience. But he knew right well how to play his part. The\r\nwily minister already stood well with the Queen--had begun to seem\r\nnecessary, or at least very useful to her, though Anne of Austria had\r\nnot yet formally declared her approval of his policy. Mazarin\r\nrepresented to her what she owed alike to the State and the royal\r\nauthority now seriously threatened. That she must prefer the interest of\r\nher son and his crown to friendships--satisfactory enough at other\r\ntimes, but which had now become dangerous. He brought before her eyes\r\nmost indubitable proofs of a conspiracy to take his life, and entreated\r\nher to choose between his enemies and himself. Anne of Austria did not\r\nhesitate, and the ruin of the _Importants_ was decided upon.\r\n\r\nMore dangerous ground could scarcely have been found whereon to post the\r\n_Importants_. The Duchess de Montbazon, as disreputable in morals and\r\ncharacter as she was remarkable for her beauty, had attacked a young\r\nwife, who, having just made her appearance at the Regent's court, had\r\nalready become the object of universal admiration. To a loveliness at\r\nonce so graceful and dazzling that it was pronounced to be angelic,\r\nMadame de Longueville added great intelligence, a most noble heart, and\r\nwas a person of all others whom it behoved the _Importants_ to\r\nconciliate; for her natural generosity of character had disinclined her\r\nto side with the party of repression, and thereby had even given some\r\numbrage to the Prime Minister. At that moment, she was merely occupied\r\nwith intellectual pursuits, innocent gallantry, and above all with the\r\nfame of her brother, the Duke d'Enghien; but there were, it must be\r\nowned, already perceptible in her mind, some germs of an _Important_,\r\nwhich, later, Rochefoucauld knew only too well how to develop. But the\r\nslanderous attack that had been made upon her, the disgraceful motive of\r\nwhich was sufficiently clear, revolted every honest heart. The\r\nungovernable impetuosity of Beaufort on this occasion was--as it\r\ndeserved to be--strongly stigmatised. Having formerly paid his addresses\r\nto Mademoiselle de Bourbon, and been rejected, his conduct assumed the\r\naspect of an obvious revenge. Moreover, Madame de Chevreuse's every\r\neffort being directed towards depriving Mazarin of supporters, she\r\nincited the devotees of either sex who were about the Queen to act\r\nagainst him, and Madame de Longueville was no less the idol of the\r\nCarmelites and the party of the _Saints_ than that of the Hotel de\r\nRambouillet. Again, the Duke d'Enghien, already covered with the laurels\r\nof Rocroy, and about to entwine therewith those of Thionville, was so\r\nevidently the arbiter of the situation, that Madame de Chevreuse\r\ninsisted, with much force, that Mazarin should be got rid of whilst the\r\nyoung Duke was occupied with the distant enemy, and before he should\r\nreturn from the army. To wound him through so susceptible a medium as\r\nthat of an adored sister, to turn him against herself without any\r\nnecessity, and hasten his return, would be a silly extravagance.\r\nTherefore, all who had any sense among the _Importants_--La\r\nRochefoucauld, La Chatre, and Campion--anxiously sought to hush up and\r\nterminate this deplorable affair; and Madame de Chevreuse, sedulous to\r\npay court to the Queen at the same time that she was weaving a subtle\r\nplot against her minister, had prepared the little fete for her at\r\nRenard's garden with the design of dispersing the last remaining\r\ncloudlets of the lately-spent tempest. But the Duchess's politic purpose\r\nwas, as we have seen, destined to fail through the insane pride of a\r\nwoman who was as senseless as she was heartless.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Alexandre de Campion, in the _Recueil_ before cited, writes to\r\n    Madame de Montbazon:--\"Si mon avis eut ete suivi chez Renard, vous\r\n    seriez sortie, pour obeir a la Reine, vous n'habiteriez pas la maison\r\n    de Rochefort, et nous ne serions pas dans le peril dont nous sommes\r\n    menaces.\"\r\n\r\nUnder these critical circumstances how did it behove Madame de Chevreuse\r\nto act? She was compelled to restrain Madame de Montbazon, but she could\r\nneither abandon her nor be false to herself. She resolved therefore to\r\nfollow up energetically the formidable project which had become the last\r\nhope and supreme resource of her party. Through Madame de Montbazon,\r\nBeaufort had been dragged into it. The latter had mustered the men of\r\naction already mentioned, and who were wholly devoted to him. A plot had\r\nbeen devised and every measure concerted for surprising and perhaps\r\nkilling the Cardinal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THE CONSPIRACY OF THE DUCHESS DE CHEVREUSE AND THE DUKE DE BEAUFORT TO\r\n  GET RID OF MAZARIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nONE need not be greatly astonished at such an enterprise on the part of\r\ntwo women of high rank and a grandson of Henry the Great. At that\r\nstirring epoch of French history--the interval between the League and\r\nthe Fronde--energy and strength were the distinctive traits of the\r\nFrench aristocracy. Neither court life nor a corrupting opulence had yet\r\nenervated it. Everything was then in extremes, in vice as in virtue. Men\r\nattacked and defended one another with the same weapons. The Marshal\r\nd'Ancre had been massacred; more than one attempt had been made to\r\nassassinate Richelieu; whilst he, on his side, had not been backward in\r\nhaving recourse to the sword and block. Corneille paints faithfully the\r\nspirit of the epoch. His Emilie is also involved in an assassination,\r\nand she is not the less represented as a perfect heroine. Madame de\r\nChevreuse had long been accustomed to conspiracies; she was bold and\r\nunscrupulous. She did not gather round her such men as Beaupuis,\r\nSaint-Ybar, De Varicarville, and de Campion merely to pass the time in\r\nidle conversation. She had not remained a stranger to the designs they\r\nhad formerly concocted against Richelieu, for in 1643 she fomented, as\r\nwe have seen, their exaltation and their devotedness; and it was not\r\nunreasonable, certainly, that Mazarin should attribute to her the first\r\nidea of the project which Beaufort was to accomplish.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it must be remembered that the _Importants_ and their\r\nsuccessors the _Frondeurs_ denied this project and declared it the\r\ninvention of the Cardinal. It is a point of the highest historical\r\nimportance and deserves serious examination, as upon this conspiracy,\r\nreal or imaginary, as may be determined after careful investigation,\r\nrests the fact whether Mazarin owed in reality all his career and the\r\ngreat future which then opened before him to a falsehood cunningly\r\ninvented and audaciously sustained; or whether Madame de Chevreuse and\r\nthe _Importants_, after having tried their utmost against him, now\r\nresolving to destroy him with the armed hand, were themselves destroyed\r\nand became the instruments of his triumph. The evidence available\r\nirresistibly leads to the latter conclusion, and we think that we shall\r\nbe able to show that the plot attributed to the _Importants_, far from\r\nbeing a chimaera, was the almost inevitable solution of the violent\r\ncrisis just described.\r\n\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, without having indulged in the insane hopes of his\r\nfriends and lent his hand to their rash enterprise, made it a point of\r\nhonour to defend them after their discomfiture, and set himself to cover\r\nthe retreat. He affects to doubt whether the plot which then made so\r\nmuch noise was real or supposititious. In his eyes, the greater\r\nprobability was that the Duke de Beaufort, by a false _finesse_,\r\nendeavoured to excite alarm in the Cardinal, believing that it was\r\nsufficient to strike terror into his mind to force him to quit France,\r\nand that it was with this view that he held secret meetings and gave\r\nthem the appearance of conspiracy. La Rochefoucauld constitutes himself\r\nespecially the champion of Madame de Chevreuse's innocence, and\r\ndeclares himself thoroughly persuaded that she was ignorant of\r\nBeaufort's designs.\r\n\r\nAfter the historian of the _Importants_, that of the _Frondeurs_ holds\r\nvery nearly the same arguments. Like La Rochefoucauld, De Retz has only\r\none object in his Memoirs--that of investing himself with a semblance of\r\ncapacity and making a great figure in every way, in evil as well as\r\ngood. He is often more truthful, because he cares less about other\r\npeople, and that he is disposed to sacrifice all the world except\r\nhimself. In this matter it is hard to conceive the motive for his\r\nreserve and incredulity. He knew right well that the majority of the\r\npersons accused of having taken part in the plot had already been\r\nimplicated in more than one such business. He himself tells us that he\r\nhad conspired with the Count de Soissons, that he had blamed him for not\r\nhaving struck down Richelieu at Amiens, and that with La Rochepot, he,\r\nthe Abbe de Retz, had formed the design of assassinating him at the\r\nTuileries during the ceremony of the baptism of Mademoiselle (de\r\nMontpensier). The Co-adjutorship of the Archbishopric of Paris, which\r\nthe Regent had just granted him, in consideration of his own services\r\nand the virtues of his father, had mollified him, it is true; but his\r\nold accomplices, who had not been so well treated as he, had remained\r\nfaithful to their cause, to their designs, to their habitudes. Was De\r\nRetz then sincere when he refused to believe that they had attempted\r\nagainst Mazarin that which he had seen them undertake, and which he had\r\nhimself undertaken against Richelieu? In his blind hatred he throws\r\neverything upon Mazarin: he pretends that he was terrified, or that he\r\nfeigned terror. It was the Abbe de la Riviere, he tells us, who, in\r\norder to rid himself of the rivalry of the Count de Montresor in the\r\nDuke d'Orleans' favour, must have persuaded Mazarin that there was a\r\nplot set on foot against him, in which Montresor was mixed up. It was\r\nthe Prince de Conde also who must have tried to destroy Beaufort through\r\nfear lest his son, the Duke d'Enghien, might engage with him in some\r\nduel, as he wished to do, to avenge his sister, during the short visit\r\nhe made to Paris after taking Thionville.\r\n\r\nTo the suspicious opinions of de Retz and La Rochefoucauld let us oppose\r\ntestimony more disinterested, and before all other the silence of\r\nMontresor,[1] who, whilst protesting that neither he nor his friend the\r\nCount de Bethune had meddled with the conspiracy imputed to the Duke de\r\nBeaufort, says not a single word against the reality of that conspiracy,\r\nwhich he would not have failed to ridicule had he believed it imaginary.\r\nMadame de Motteville, who was not in the habit of overwhelming the\r\nunfortunate, after having reported with impartiality the different\r\nrumours circulated at Court, relates certain facts which appear to her\r\nauthentic, and which are decisive.[2] One of the best informed and most\r\ntruthful of contemporary historians expresses not the slightest doubt on\r\nthis head. \"The _Importants_,\" says Monglat, \"seeing that they could not\r\ndrive the Cardinal out of France, resolved to despatch him with their\r\ndaggers, and held several councils on this subject at the Hotel de\r\nVendome.\" That opinion is confirmed by new and numerous particulars with\r\nwhich Mazarin's _carnets_ and confidential letters furnish us.\r\n\r\n    [1] Memoires, Petitot Collection, t. lix.\r\n\r\n    [2] Memoires, t. i., p. 184.\r\n\r\nThe person whom Mazarin signalizes in his _carnets_ and letters as the\r\ntrusted friend of Beaufort and after him the principal accused, the\r\nCount de Beaupuis, son of the Count de Maille, had found means of\r\nsheltering himself from the minister's first searches; he had succeeded\r\nin escaping from France and sought an asylum at Rome under the avowed\r\nprotection of Spain. Mazarin left no stone unturned to obtain from the\r\nCourt of Rome the extradition of Beaupuis, in order that he might be\r\nlegally tried. The Pope at first could not refuse, at least for form's\r\nsake, to have Beaupuis committed to the Castle of St. Angelo. But he was\r\nsoon liberated, and provided with a State lodging wherein he was allowed\r\nto see nearly every one who came. Mazarin complained loudly of such\r\nindulgence. \"It is all arranged,\" said he, \"that when necessary he may\r\nescape, or at any rate the Duke de Vendome is furnished with every\r\nfacility for poisoning him, in order that with Beaupuis may perish the\r\nprincipal proof of his son's treason. If all this happened in Barbary,\r\npeople would be highly indignant. And this is suffered to take place in\r\nRome, in the capital of Christianity, under the eyes and by the orders\r\nof a Pope!\"\r\n\r\nFailing Beaupuis, Mazarin would have liked to put his hand upon one of\r\nthe brothers Campion, intimately connected as they were with Beaufort\r\nand Madame de Chevreuse, and too closely in the confidence of both not\r\nto know all their secrets. He himself complains, as we have seen, of\r\nbeing very badly seconded. And then he had to do with emerited\r\nconspirators, consummate in the art of concealing themselves and of\r\nleaving no trace of their whereabouts--with the active and indefatigable\r\nDuchess de Chevreuse, and with the Duke de Vendome, who, in order to\r\nsave his son, set about forwarding the escape of all those whose\r\ndepositions might help to convict him, or kept them somehow in his own\r\nhands, hidden and shut up close at Anet. Mazarin was thus only able to\r\narrest a few obscure individuals who were ignorant of the plot, and\r\ncould throw no light upon it.\r\n\r\nBut it is needless to exhaust existing proofs in demonstration of the\r\nfact that Mazarin did not enact a farce by instituting proceedings\r\nagainst the conspirators, that he pursued them with sincerity and\r\nvigour, and that he was perfectly convinced that a project of\r\nassassination had been formed against him, when the existence of that\r\nproject is elsewhere averred, when, in default of a sentence of the\r\nparliament, which could not have been given in the teeth of insufficient\r\nevidence, neither Beaupuis, nor the Campions, nor Lie, nor Brillet\r\nhaving been arrested, better proof being extant in the full and entire\r\nconfession of one of the principal conspirators, with the plan and all\r\nthe details of the affair set forth in Memoirs of comparatively recent\r\npublication, but the authenticity of which cannot be contested. We\r\nallude to the precious Memoirs of Henri de Campion,[3] brother of Madame\r\nde Chevreuse's friend, whom that lady had introduced also to the service\r\nof the Duke de Vendome, and more particularly to that of the Duke de\r\nBeaufort. Henri had accompanied the Duke in his flight to England after\r\nthe conspiracy of Cinq Mars, and he had returned with him; he possessed\r\nhis entire confidence, and he relates nothing in which he himself had\r\nnot taken a considerable part. Henri's character was very different to\r\nthat of his brother Alexandre. He was a well-educated man, full of\r\nhonour and courage, not in the least given to boasting, averse to all\r\nintrigue, and born to make his way through life by the straightest paths\r\nin the career of arms. He wrote these Memoirs in solitude, to which\r\nafter the loss of his daughter and his wife he had retired to await\r\ndeath amidst the exercise of a genuine piety. It is not in such a frame\r\nof mind that a man is disposed to invent fables, and there is no middle\r\nway. What he says is that which we must believe absolutely, or if we\r\nhave any doubt that he speaks the truth, he must be considered as the\r\nworst of villains. No interested feeling could have directed his pen,\r\nfor he compiled his Memoirs, or at least he finished them, a short time\r\nafter Mazarin's death, without thought, therefore, of paying court to\r\nhim by making very tardy revelations, and scarcely two years before he\r\nhimself died in 1663. Thus it may be fairly inferred that Henri de\r\nCampion wrote strictly under the inspiration of his conscience. One has\r\nonly to open his Memoirs to see confirmed, point by point, all the\r\nparticulars with which Mazarin's _carnets_ are filled. Nothing is there\r\nwanting, everything coincides, all marvellously corresponds. It appears,\r\nindeed, as though Mazarin in making his notes had had before his eyes de\r\nCampion's Memoirs, or that the latter whilst penning them had Mazarin's\r\n_carnets_ before him: he at once so thoroughly takes up the thread and\r\ncompletes them.\r\n\r\n    [3] \"Memoires de Henri de Campion, &c.,\" 1807. Treuttel and Wuertz.\r\n    Paris.\r\n\r\nHis brother Alexandre, in his letters of the month of August, 1643, had\r\nalready let slip more than one mysterious sentence. He wrote to Madame\r\nde Montbazon in banishment:--\"You must not despair, madam, there are\r\nstill some half-a-dozen honest folks who do not give up.... Your\r\nillustrious friend will not abandon you. If to be prudent it were\r\nnecessary to renounce your acquaintance, there are those who would\r\nprefer rather to pass for fools all their days.\" Like Montresor, he does\r\nnot once say that there was no plot framed against Mazarin, which is a\r\nkind of tacit avowal; and when the storm burst, he took care to conceal\r\nhimself, advised Beaupuis to do the same, and ends with these\r\nsignificant words:--\"In embarking in Court affairs one cannot be certain\r\nof being master of events, and whilst we profit by the lucky ones, we\r\nmust resolve to put up with the unlucky.\" Henri de Campion raises this\r\nalready very transparent veil.\r\n\r\nHe declares plainly that there was a project on foot to get rid of\r\nMazarin, and that that project was conceived, not by Beaufort, but by\r\nMadame de Chevreuse in concert with Madame de Montbazon. \"I think,\" says\r\nhe, \"that the Duke's design did not spring from his own particular\r\nsentiment, but from the persuasion of the duchesses de Chevreuse and de\r\nMontbazon, who exercised entire sway over his mind and had an\r\nirreconcilable hatred to the Cardinal. What makes me say so, is that,\r\nwhilst he was under that resolution, I always observed that he had an\r\ninternal repugnance which, if I mistake not, was overcome by some pledge\r\nwhich he may have given to those ladies.\" There _was_, therefore, a\r\nplot, and its real author, as Mazarin truly said, and Campion repeats,\r\nwas Madame de Chevreuse; if so, Madame de Montbazon was only an\r\ninstrument in her hands.\r\n\r\nBeaufort, once inveigled, drew in also his intimate friend, Count de\r\nMaille's son, the Count de Beaupuis, cornet in the Queen's horse-guards.\r\nTo them Madame de Chevreuse adjoined Alexandre de Campion, the elder\r\nbrother of Henri. \"She loved him much,\" remarks the latter, and in a way\r\nwhich, added to certain ambiguous words of Alexandre, excites suspicion\r\nwhether the elder Campion were not in fact one of the numerous\r\nsuccessors of Chalais. He was then thirty-three, and his brother\r\nconfesses that he had caught from the Count de Soissons the taste for\r\nand the habitudes of faction. Beaupuis and Alexandre de Campion\r\napproved of the plot when communicated to them, \"the former,\" says\r\nHenri, \"believing that it would be a means for him of attaining to a\r\nposition of greater importance, and my brother seeing therein Madame de\r\nChevreuse's advantage and by consequence his own.\"\r\n\r\nSuch were the two first accomplices of Beaufort. A little later he\r\nopened his mind on the subject to Henri de Campion, one of his principal\r\ngentlemen; to Lie, captain of his guards; and to Brillet, his equerry.\r\nThere the secret rested. Many other gentlemen and domestics of the house\r\nof Vendome were destined to take action in the affair, but were admitted\r\nto no confidence. The project was well conceived and worthy of Madame de\r\nChevreuse. There were at most five or six conspirators--three capable of\r\nkeeping the secret, and who did keep it. Below them, the men of action,\r\nwho did not know what they would be called on to do; and in the\r\nbackground, the men of the morrow, who might be reckoned upon to applaud\r\nthe blow, when it had been struck, without it being judged fitting to\r\nadmit them to the conspiracy. At least Henri de Campion does not even\r\nname Montresor, Bethune, Fontraille, Varicarville, Saint-Ybar, which\r\nexplains wherefore Mazarin, whilst keeping his eye upon them, did not\r\nhave them arrested. Neither does Campion speak of Chandenier, La Chatre,\r\nde Treville, the Duke de Bouillon, the Duke de Guise, De Retz, nor La\r\nRochefoucauld, whose sentiments were not doubtful, but who were not\r\ninclined to go so far as to sully their hands with an assassination. And\r\nthat further explains the silence of Mazarin with regard to them in all\r\nthat relates to Beaufort's conspiracy, although he did not cherish the\r\nslightest illusion as to their dispositions, and as to the part they\r\nwould have taken if the plot had succeeded, or even if a serious\r\nstruggle had taken place.\r\n\r\nThe conspiracy rested for some time between Madame de Chevreuse, Madame\r\nde Montbazon, Beaufort, Beaupuis, and Alexandre de Campion. The final\r\nresolution was only taken at the end of July or in the first days of\r\nAugust, that is to say, precisely during the height of the quarrel\r\nbetween Madame de Montbazon and Madame de Longueville, which ushered in\r\nthe crisis and opened the door to all the events which followed. It was\r\nthen only that Beaufort spoke of it to Henri de Campion, in presence of\r\nBeaupuis. Mazarin's crime was the continuation of Richelieu's system.\r\n\"The Duke de Beaufort told me that he thought I had remarked that the\r\nCardinal Mazarin was re-establishing at court and throughout the kingdom\r\nthe tyranny of Cardinal de Richelieu, with even more of authority and\r\nviolence than had been shown under the government of the latter; that\r\nhaving entirely gained the Queen's mind and made all the ministers\r\ndevoted to him, it was impossible to arrest his evil designs save by\r\ndepriving him of life; that the public weal having made him resolve to\r\ntake that step, he informed me of it in order that I might aid him with\r\nmy advice and personally assist in its execution. Beaupuis next 'took up\r\nhis parable,' and warmly represented the evils which the too great\r\nauthority of Richelieu had caused France, and concluded by saying that\r\nwe must prevent the like inconvenience before his successor had rendered\r\nmatters remediless.\" Such conclusion embodied as nearly as possible the\r\nviews and language of _Importants_ and _Frondeurs_, of La Rochefoucauld\r\nand De Retz. Henri de Campion represents himself as having at first\r\ncombatted the Duke's project with so much force that more than once he\r\nwas shaken; but the two duchesses wound him up again very quickly, and\r\nBeaupuis and Alexandre de Campion, instead of holding him back,\r\nencouraged him. Shortly afterwards, Beaufort having declared that he had\r\nmade up his mind, Henri de Campion gave in on two conditions: \"The one,\"\r\nhe tells us, \"of not laying his hand on the Cardinal, since I would\r\nrather take my own life than do a deed of such nature. The other, that\r\nif the Duke should arrange that the project should be put into execution\r\nduring his absence, I would never mix myself up in it; whereas if he\r\nwere himself to be present, I should without scruple keep myself near\r\nhis person, in order to defend him against any mischance that might\r\nhappen, my duty and affection towards him equally obliging me thereto.\r\nHe granted me those two conditions, testifying at the same time that he\r\nesteemed me more for having made them, and added that he would be\r\npresent at the execution of the project, so that he might authorise it\r\nby his presence.\"\r\n\r\nThe plan was to attack the Cardinal in the street, whilst paying visits\r\nin his carriage, commonly having with him only a few ecclesiastics,\r\nbesides five or six lackeys. It would be necessary to present themselves\r\nin force and unexpectedly, stop the vehicle and strike Mazarin. To do\r\nthat, it was necessary that a certain number of the Vendome domestics,\r\nwho were not in the secret, should post themselves daily, from early\r\nmorning, in the _cabarets_ around the Cardinal's abode, which was then\r\nat the Hotel de Cleves, near the Louvre. Among the domestics let into\r\nthe secret, Henri de Campion names positively Gauseville. Over them were\r\nplaced \"the Sieurs d'Avancourt and De Brassy, Picardians, very resolute\r\nmen and intimate friends of Lie.\" The pretext given out was that the\r\nCondes proposing to put an affront upon Madame de Montbazon, the Duke\r\nde Beaufort, in order to oppose it, desired to have in hand a troop of\r\ngentlemen well mounted and armed. Their parts were allotted beforehand.\r\nA certain number were to pounce upon the Cardinal's coachman, at the\r\nsame moment that others were to open the two doors and strike him,\r\nwhilst the Duke would be at hand on horseback, with Beaupuis, Henri de\r\nCampion, and others, to cut down or drive off those who should be\r\ndisposed to resist. Alexandre de Campion was to keep near the Duchess de\r\nChevreuse and at her orders; and she herself ought more than ever to be\r\nassiduous in her attentions to the Queen, in order to smooth the way for\r\nher friends, and, in case of success, draw the Regent to the side of the\r\nvictorious.\r\n\r\nSeveral occasions favourable to the execution of this plan presented\r\nthemselves. In the first instance, Henri de Campion being with his band\r\nin the Rue du Champ-Fleuri--one end of which joins the Rue Saint-Honore\r\nand the other approaches the Louvre--saw the Cardinal leave the Hotel de\r\nCleves in his carriage with the Abbe de Bentivoglio, the nephew of the\r\ncelebrated cardinal of that name, with a few ecclesiastics and valets.\r\nCampion inquired of one of them whither the Cardinal was going, and was\r\nanswered--to visit the Marshal d'Estrees. \"I saw,\" says Campion, \"that\r\nif I had made use of the information, his death would have been\r\ninevitable. But I thought that I should be so guilty in the eyes of God\r\nand man that I resisted the temptation to do so.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day it was known that the Cardinal would be present at a\r\ncollation to be given by Madame du Vigean at her charming residence of\r\nLa Barre, at the entrance of the valley of Montmorency, where Madame de\r\nLongueville was staying, and which the Queen had promised to honour\r\nwith a visit, and who had already set out. The Cardinal was repairing\r\nthither, having with him in his coach only the Count d'Harcourt.\r\nBeaufort ordered Campion to assemble his troop and to ride after him,\r\nbut Campion represented to the Duke that if they attacked the Cardinal\r\nin the company of the Count d'Harcourt, they must decide upon killing\r\nboth, Harcourt being too generous to see Mazarin stabbed before his eyes\r\nwithout defending him, and that the murder of Harcourt would raise\r\nagainst them the entire house of Lorraine.\r\n\r\nSome days afterwards information was given that the Cardinal was engaged\r\nto dine at Maisons, with the Marshal d'Estrees, to meet the Duke\r\nd'Orleans. \"I made the Duke consent,\" says Campion, \"that should the\r\nminister be in the same carriage with his Royal Highness, the design\r\nshould not be executed; but he said, that if he were alone, he must be\r\nkilled. Early in the morning he had the horses out and kept himself in\r\nreadiness at the Capucins with Beaupuis, near the Hotel de Vendome,\r\nposting a valet on foot in the street to tell him when the Cardinal\r\nshould pass, and enjoining me to keep with those whom I was accustomed\r\nto muster at the Cabaret l'Ange, in the Rue Saint-Honore, very near the\r\nHotel de Vendome, and if the Cardinal journeyed without the Duke\r\nd'Orleans, I should mount instantly with all my men, and intercept him\r\nwhen passing the Capucins. I was,\" adds Campion, \"in a state of anxiety\r\nwhich may readily be imagined, until I saw the carriage of the Duke\r\nd'Orleans pass, and perceived the Cardinal inside with him.\"\r\n\r\nAt length, Beaufort's irritation being carried to the highest pitch by\r\nthe banishment from court of Madame de Montbazon (which was certainly\r\non the 22nd of August), goaded by Madame de Chevreuse, by passion, and\r\nby a false sense of honour, he became himself impatient to act. Seeing\r\nthat, during the day, he encountered incessant difficulties of which he\r\nwas far from divining the cause, he resolved to strike the blow at\r\nnight, and prepared an ambuscade, the success of which seemed certain,\r\nand the details of which we have from Campion. The Cardinal went every\r\nevening to visit the Queen, and returned sufficiently late. It was\r\narranged to attack him between the Louvre and the Hotel de Cleves.\r\nHorses were to be in readiness in some neighbouring inn. The Duke\r\nhimself should keep watch with Beaupuis and Campion, during the time the\r\nminister should be with the Queen, and so soon as he came forth, all\r\nthree should advance and make a signal to the rest, who, in the\r\nmeanwhile, should remain on horseback on the quay, by the river side,\r\nclose to the Louvre. All which could be very well done at night without\r\nawakening any suspicion.\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the person who furnishes these very precise\r\ndetails was one of the principal conspirators, that he wrote at\r\nsufficiently considerable distance from the event, in safety, and, to\r\nrepeat it once again, with no interest, fearing nothing more from\r\nMazarin, who had recently died, and expecting nothing from him. It must\r\nbe also remembered that speaking as he has done, he accuses his own\r\nbrother; that, without doubt, he attributes to himself laudable\r\nintentions and even some good actions, but that he confesses having\r\nentered into the plot, and that, if its execution had taken place he\r\nwould have taken part in it, in fighting by the side of Beaufort. The\r\nprocess submitted to the parliament not having led to anything, through\r\nfailure of evidence, Campion did not imagine that Mazarin had ever\r\nknown \"the circumstances of the plot, nor those acquainted with it to\r\nthe very bottom, and who were engaged in it.\" He adds also, \"that now\r\nthe Cardinal is dead there is no longer any reason to fear injuring any\r\none in stating matters as they are.\" He therefore does not defend\r\nhimself; he believes himself to be sheltered from all quest, he writes\r\nonly to relieve his conscience.\r\n\r\nFrom these curious revelations we further learn what importance Mazarin\r\nattached to the arrest of Henri Campion; and that writer's statements\r\nare not only substantially confirmed by various entries in the\r\n_carnets_, but read like a translation into French of those pages from\r\nthe Cardinal's Italian. \"They threw,\" he says, \"into the Bastille,\r\nAvancourt and Brassy, where they deposed that I had mustered them on\r\nseveral occasions, on the part of the Duke de Beaufort, for the\r\ninterests of Madame de Montbazon, as I had told them. This did not\r\nafford any motive for interrogating the Duke, since they owned that he\r\nhad not spoken to them; thus he would not have failed to deny having\r\ngiven the orders which I carried to them on his part. It was then seen\r\nthat the process against him could not be carried on before I had been\r\narrested, in order to find matter whereon to interrogate him after my\r\nown depositions, and so thoroughly to embarrass us both that every trace\r\nof the affair might be discovered. The proof of this conspiracy was of\r\nmost essential importance to the Cardinal, who directing all his efforts\r\nto the establishment of his government, and affecting to do so by gentle\r\nmeans, had been unfortunate enough to be constrained, in the outset, to\r\nuse violence against one of the greatest men in the realm, for his own\r\nindividual interest, without a conviction to prove that he was\r\ncompelled to treat the Duke with rigour. The Cardinal, despairing of\r\nbeing able to persuade others of that of which he was entirely assured,\r\nhad a great desire to get me into his hands. He was nevertheless of\r\nopinion that he must give me time to reassure myself of safety in order\r\nto take me with the greater facility.\"\r\n\r\nWe may add to all this that Henri de Campion, sought after sharply, and\r\nclosely shut up in his retreat at Anet, under the protection of the Duke\r\nde Vendome, having fled from France and joined his friend the Count de\r\nBeaupuis at Rome, gives an account of the obstinate efforts made by\r\nMazarin to obtain the extradition of the latter, the resistance of Pope\r\nInnocent X., the regard shown to Beaupuis when they were compelled to\r\nconfine him in the Castle of Saint-Angelo; all of which being equally to\r\nbe met with in the _carnets_ and letters of Mazarin and the memoirs of\r\nHenri de Campion, places beyond doubt the perfect sincerity of the\r\nCardinal's proceedings and the accuracy of his information.\r\n\r\nAre not these, we may ask, proofs sufficient to reduce to naught the\r\ninterested doubts of La Rochefoucauld and the passionate denials of the\r\nchief of the Fronde, the very clever but very little truthful Cardinal\r\nde Retz, the most ardent and most obstinate of Mazarin's enemies? It\r\nwould seem, indeed, either that there is no certitude whatever in\r\nhistory, or that it must be considered henceforth as a point absolutely\r\ndemonstrated that there was a project determined upon to kill Mazarin;\r\nthat that project had been conceived by Madame de Chevreuse, and in some\r\nsort imposed by her upon Beaufort with the aid of Madame de Montbazon;\r\nthat Beaufort had for principal accomplices the Count de Beaupuis and\r\nAlexandre de Campion; that Henri de Campion had entered later into the\r\naffair, at the pressing solicitation of the Duke, as well as two other\r\nofficers of secondary rank; that during the month of August there were\r\ndivers serious attempts to put it into execution, particularly the last\r\none after the banishment of Madame de Montbazon, at the very end of\r\nAugust or rather on the 1st of September; and that such attempt only\r\nfailed through circumstances altogether independent of the will of the\r\nconspirators.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  FAILURE OF THE PLOT TO ASSASSINATE MAZARIN. ARREST OF BEAUFORT,\r\n  BANISHMENT OF MADAME DE CHEVREUSE, AND DISPERSION OF THE \"IMPORTANTS.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLET us now inquire how the last attempt against Mazarin's life--that\r\nnocturnal ambuscade so well planned and so deliberately set about on the\r\n1st of September, 1643--chanced to fail, and what was the result of such\r\nfailure. Without stopping to discuss the conjectures of Campion on this\r\npoint, it may suffice to state that Mazarin, who was on his guard,\r\nevaded the blow destined for him by not visiting the Queen during the\r\nevening on which it was resolved to kill him as he should return from\r\nthe Louvre. Next day the scene was changed. A rumour spread rapidly that\r\nthe Prime Minister had expected to have been murdered by Beaufort and\r\nhis friends, that he had escaped, fortune having declared in his favour.\r\nA plot to assassinate, more especially when it fails, invariably excites\r\nthe strongest indignation, and the man who has extricated himself from a\r\ngreat peril and seems destined to sweep all such from his path, readily\r\nfinds adherents and defenders. A host of people who would probably have\r\nsupported Beaufort victorious, now flocked to offer their swords and\r\nservices to the Cardinal, and on that morning he went to the Louvre\r\nescorted by three hundred gentlemen.\r\n\r\nFor several days previously, Mazarin had seen clearly that, cost what\r\nit might, he must cut his way through the knotted intricacy of the\r\nsituation, and that the moment had arrived for forcing Anne of Austria\r\nto choose her part. The occasion was decisive. If the peril which he had\r\njust undergone, and which was only suspended over his head, did not\r\nsuffice to draw the Queen from her incertitude, it would prove that she\r\ndid not love him; and Mazarin knew well that, amidst the many dangers\r\nsurrounding him, his entire strength lay in the Queen's affection, and\r\nthat thereon depended his present safety and future fate. Whether,\r\ntherefore, through policy or sincere affection, it was always to Anne of\r\nAustria's heart that he addressed himself, and at the outset of the\r\ncrisis he had said to himself: \"If I believed that the Queen was merely\r\nmaking use of me through necessity, without having any personal\r\ninclination for me, I would not stay here three days longer.\"[1] But\r\nenough has been said to show plainly that Anne of Austria _loved_\r\nMazarin. Comparing him with his rivals, she appreciated him daily more\r\nand more. She admired the precision and clearness of his intellect, his\r\nfinesse and penetration, and that extraordinary energy which enabled him\r\nto bear the weight of government with marvellous ease--his quick and\r\naccurate introspection, his profound prudence, and at the same time the\r\njudicious vigour of his resolves. She saw the affairs of France\r\nprospering on all sides under his firm and skilful hand. The Cardinal,\r\nit is true, was not quite a nullity, in the fierce war which had\r\ninaugurated the new reign so dazzlingly; but a power of no slight weight\r\nwas manifest in the success which had followed his advent to office,\r\nand which proved to startled Europe that the victory of Rocroy was not a\r\nlucky stroke of chance. When every member of the Council was opposed to\r\nthe siege of Thionville, and when Turenne himself, on being consulted,\r\ndid not venture to declare his opinion on the subject, it was Mazarin\r\nwho had insisted with an unflinching persistence that the victory of\r\nRocroy should be profited by, and that France should extend her frontier\r\nto the Rhine. That proposition, doubtless, emanated from the youthful\r\nconqueror, but Mazarin had the merit of comprehending, sustaining, and\r\ncausing it to triumph. If no first minister had ever before been so\r\nserved by such a general, neither had general ever been so supported by\r\nsuch a minister; and thanks to both, on the 11th of August, whilst the\r\nchivalrous _Importants_ were exhausting their combined talents in\r\nputting a shameful affront upon the noble sister of the hero who had\r\njust served France so gloriously, and who was about to aggrandize it\r\nfurther--whilst they were displaying their vapid and turgid eloquence in\r\nthe salons, or sharpening their poniards in gloomy council chambers,\r\nThionville, then one of the chief strongholds of the Empire, surrendered\r\nafter an obstinate defence. Thus, the Regency of Anne of Austria had\r\nopened under the most brilliant auspices.\r\n\r\n    [1] Entry in Carnet, iii. p. 10, in Spanish:--\"Sy yo creyera lo que\r\n    dicen que S.M. se sierve di mi per necessidad, sin tener alguna\r\n    inclination, no pararia aqui tres dias.\"\r\n\r\nBut in the height of this national glory and signal triumph, Queen Anne\r\nmust indeed have shuddered when Mazarin placed before her all the proofs\r\nof the odious conspiracy formed against him. Explanations the most\r\nminute and confidential thereupon ensued between them. It was now more\r\nthan ever compulsory for her to \"raise the mask,\"[2] to sacrifice to a\r\nmanifest necessity the circumspection she was studious of preserving--to\r\nbrave somewhat further the tittle-tattle of a few devotees of either\r\nsex, and at all events to permit her Prime Minister to defend his life.\r\nUp to this moment Anne of Austria had hesitated, for reasons which may\r\nbe readily comprehended. But Madame de Montbazon's insolence had greatly\r\nirritated her; the conviction she acquired that numerous attempts to\r\nassassinate Mazarin had only by chance failed, and might be renewed,\r\ndecided her; and it was, therefore, towards the close of August, 1643,\r\nwhen the date of that declared ascendancy, open and unrivalled, must be\r\ncertainly fixed, of the Minister of the Queen Regent. These\r\nconspirators, by proceeding to the last extremities, and thereby making\r\nher tremble for Mazarin's life, hastened the triumph of the happy\r\nCardinal; and on the morrow of the last nocturnal ambush in which he was\r\nmarked for destruction, Jules Mazarin became absolute master of the\r\nQueen's heart, and more powerful than Richelieu had ever been after the\r\n_Day of Dupes_.\r\n\r\n    [2] \"Quitarse la maschera.\" Carnet, ii. p. 65.\r\n\r\nThe minister's _carnets_ will be searched in vain for any traces of the\r\nexplanations which Mazarin must have had with the Queen during this\r\ngrave conjuncture. Such explanations are not of a nature likely to be\r\nforgotten, and of which there is any need to take notes. An obscure\r\npassage, however, is to be met with, written in Spanish, of which the\r\nfollowing words have a meaning clear enough to be understood: \"I ought\r\nno longer to have any doubt, since the Queen, in an excess of goodness,\r\nhas told me that nothing could deprive me of the post which she has done\r\nme the honour of giving me near her; nevertheless, as fear is the\r\ninseparable companion of affection, &c.\"[3] At this anxious moment,\r\nMazarin was attacked with a slight illness, brought on by incessant\r\nlabour and wearing anxieties, and an attack of jaundice having\r\nsupervened, the Cardinal jotted down the following brief but highly\r\nsuggestive memorandum:--\"_La giallezza cagionata da soverchio\r\namore_.\"[4]\r\n\r\n    [3] Carnet, iii. p. 45.--\"Mas contodo esto siendo el temor un\r\n    compagnero inseparabile dell'affection,\" &c.\r\n\r\n    [4] Carnet, iv. p. 3.\r\n\r\nMadame de Motteville was in attendance on Anne of Austria when the\r\nrumour of the abortive attempt at assassination brought a crowd of\r\ncourtiers to the Louvre in hot haste to protest their devotedness to the\r\nCrown. The Queen, with great emotion, whispered to her trusty\r\nlady-in-waiting: \"Ere eight and forty hours elapse you shall see how I\r\nwill avenge myself for the evil tricks these false friends have played\r\nme.\" \"Never,\" adds Madame de Motteville, \"can the remembrance of those\r\nfew brief words be effaced from my mind. I saw at that moment, by the\r\nfire that flashed in the Queen's eyes, and in fact by what happened on\r\nthat very evening and next day, what it is to be a female sovereign when\r\nenraged, and with the power of doing what she pleases.\"[5] Had the\r\ncautious lady-in-waiting been less discreet, she might have added,\r\n\"especially when that sovereign lady is a woman in love.\"\r\n\r\n    [5] Memoires, vol. i. p. 185.\r\n\r\nThe break-up and dispersion of the _Importants_ once decided upon, the\r\nfirst step was to arrest Beaufort, and bring him to trial. To this the\r\nQueen gave her consent. Of the authority Mazarin had acquired, such\r\nproceeding was a striking indication, and showed how far Anne of Austria\r\nmight one day go in defence of a minister who was dear to her. The Duke\r\nde Beaufort had been, before her husband's death, the man in whom the\r\nQueen placed most confidence, and for some time he was thought destined\r\nto play the brilliant part of a royal favourite. In a brief space he had\r\neffectually thrown away his chance by his presumptuous conduct, his\r\nevident incapacity, and yet more by his public _liaison_ with Madame de\r\nMontbazon. Still the Queen had shown a somewhat singular weakness in his\r\nfavour, and at the expiration of three short months to sign an order for\r\nhis arrest was a great step--necessary, it is true, but extreme, and\r\nwhich was the manifest sign of an entire change in the heart and\r\nintimate relations of Anne of Austria. The dissimulation even with which\r\nshe acted in that affair marks the deliberative firmness of her\r\nresolution.\r\n\r\nThe 2nd of September, 1643, was truly a memorable day in the career of\r\nMazarin, and we may say, in the annals of France; for it witnessed the\r\nconfirming of the royal power, shaken to its base by the deaths of\r\nRichelieu and Louis XIII., and the ruin of the party of the\r\n_Importants_.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 2nd, all Paris and its Court rang with the report\r\nof the ambuscade laid for Mazarin the night previous, between the Louvre\r\nand the Hotel de Cleves. The five conspirators who had joined hands with\r\nBeaufort in it had taken flight and placed themselves in safety.\r\nBeaufort and Madame de Chevreuse could not imitate them: flight for them\r\nwould have been a self-denunciation. The intrepid Duchess therefore had\r\nnot hesitated to appear at Court, and she was at the Regent's side\r\nduring the evening of the 2nd together with another person, a stranger\r\nto these dark plots and even incapable of putting faith in them--a very\r\ndifferent enemy of Mazarin--the pious and noble Madame de Hautefort. As\r\nfor the Duke, careless and courageous, he had gone to the chase in the\r\nmorning, and at his return he went, according to his custom, to present\r\nhis homage to the Queen. On entering the Louvre he met his mother,\r\nMadame de Vendome, and his sister the Duchess de Nemours, who had\r\naccompanied the Queen all day and remarked her emotion. They did all\r\nthey could to prevent him going up stairs, and entreated him to absent\r\nhimself for a while. He, without troubling himself in the slightest\r\ndegree, answered them in the words of the doomed Duke de Guise--\"They\r\ndare not!\"--and entered the Queen's great cabinet, who received him with\r\nthe best grace possible, and asked him all sorts of questions about his\r\nhunting, \"as though,\" says Madame de Motteville, \"she had no other\r\nthought in her mind.\" The Cardinal having come in in the midst of this\r\ngentle chat, the Queen rose and bade him follow her. It appeared as if\r\nshe wished to take counsel with him in her chamber. She entered it,\r\nfollowed by her Minister. At the same time the Duke de Beaufort, about\r\nto leave, met Guitant, captain of the guard, who arrested him, and\r\ncommanded the Duke to follow him in the names of the King and Queen. The\r\nPrince, without showing any surprise, after having looked fixedly at\r\nhim, said, \"Yes, I will; but this, I must own, is strange enough.\" Then\r\nturning towards Mesdames de Chevreuse and de Hautefort, who were talking\r\ntogether, he said to them, \"Ladies, you see that the Queen has caused me\r\nto be arrested.\" The young nobleman then submitted to the royal mandate\r\nwithout offering the slightest resistance; slept that night at the\r\nLouvre, and the next morning was taken to the donjon of Vincennes, while\r\na general decree of banishment was pronounced against all the principal\r\nmembers of the faction.\r\n\r\nThe Vendomes were ordered to retire to Anet; and the Chateau d'Anet\r\nhaving soon become what the Hotel de Vendome at Paris had been, a haunt\r\nof the conspirators, Mazarin demanded them from the Duke Caesar, who took\r\ngood care not to give them up. The Cardinal was almost reduced to the\r\nnecessity of laying siege to the chateau in regular form. He threatened\r\nto enter the place by main force and lay hands on Beaufort's\r\naccomplices; unable to endure the scandal that a prince even of the\r\nblood should brave law and justice with impunity, he had determined to\r\npush matters to the uttermost, and was about to take energetic measures,\r\nwhen the Duke de Vendome himself decided on quitting France, and went to\r\nItaly to await the fall of Mazarin, as formerly he had awaited in\r\nEngland that of Richelieu.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Beaufort, the dispersion of his accomplices, his friends\r\nand his family, was the first indispensable measure forced upon Mazarin\r\nto enable him to face a danger that seemed most imminent. But what would\r\nit have availed him to lop off an arm had he left the head\r\nuntouched--had Madame de Chevreuse remained at Court, ever ready to\r\nsurround the Queen with attention and homage, assiduous to retain and\r\nhusband the last remnant of her old favour, in order to sustain and\r\nsecretly encourage the malcontents, inspire them with her audacity, and\r\nstir them up to fresh conspiracies? She still held in her grasp the\r\nscarcely-severed threads of the plot; and at her right hand there was a\r\nman too wary to allow himself to be again compromised by such dark\r\ndoings, but quite ready to profit by them, and whom Madame de Chevreuse\r\nhad sedulously exhibited not only to Anne of Austria, but to France and\r\nall Europe, as a man singularly capable of conducting State affairs.\r\nMazarin, therefore, did not hesitate; but on the day following\r\nBeaufort's arrest, Chateauneuf, Montresor, and St. Ybar were banished.\r\nThe first-named was invited to present himself at Court, kiss the\r\nQueen's hand, and then betake himself to his government in Touraine.\r\nRichelieu's late Keeper of the Seals deemed it something to have\r\nescaped an open disgrace, to have resumed the eminent post he had\r\nformerly occupied under the Crown, and the government of a large\r\nprovince. Yet did his ambition soar far higher still: but he kept it in\r\ncheck, and merely postponed its flight for a less stormy hour--obeyed\r\nthe Queen, skilfully remained friends with her, and likewise kept on\r\nvery good terms with her Prime Minister--biding his time until he might\r\ndisplace him. He had to wait a long time, however; but eventually did\r\nnot quit life without once more grasping, for a moment at least, that\r\npower which the indulgence of an insensate passion had lost him, but\r\nwhich an inviolable and unswerving friendship in the end restored to\r\nhim.[6]\r\n\r\n    [6] Chateauneuf held the seals from March, 1650, when Mazarin went\r\n    into voluntary exile, until April, 1651. He died in 1653, at the age\r\n    of seventy-three.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse unhappily lacked the wisdom displayed throughout\r\nthis fiery ordeal by Chateauneuf. She forgot for once to look with a\r\nsmiling face upon the passing storm, in which she was too suddenly\r\ncaught to escape altogether scatheless. La Chatre--one of her friends,\r\nand who saw her almost every day--relates that during the very same\r\nevening on which Beaufort was arrested at the Louvre, \"Her Majesty told\r\nthe Duchess that she believed her to be innocent of the prisoner's\r\ndesigns, but that nevertheless to avoid scandal she deemed it fitting\r\nthat Madame de Chevreuse should quietly withdraw to Dampierre, and that\r\nafter making some short sojourn there she should retire into\r\nTouraine.\"[7] The Duchess, therefore, saw plainly that she had nothing\r\nfor it but to go at once to Dampierre; but no sooner did she arrive at\r\nher favourite chateau than, instead of remaining quiet, she began to\r\nmove heaven and earth to save those who had compromised themselves for\r\nher sake. She began, indeed, to knot the meshes of a new web of\r\nintrigue, and even found means of placing a letter in the Queen's own\r\nhand. Message after message was, however, sent to hasten her\r\ndeparture--Montagu being despatched to her on the same errand, as was\r\nalso La Porte. She received them haughtily, and deferred her journey\r\nunder divers pretexts. It will be remembered that on going to meet the\r\nDuchess when on her road from Brussels, Montagu had offered her, on the\r\nQueen's part as well as that of Mazarin, to discharge in her name the\r\ndebts she had contracted during so many years of exile. The Duchess had\r\nalready received heavy sums, but was unwilling to set forth for Touraine\r\nuntil after the Queen should have performed all her promises. Marie de\r\nRohan had left the Louvre and Paris, her bosom swelling with grief and\r\nrage, as Hannibal had quitted Italy. She felt that the Court and capital\r\nand the Queen's inner circle formed the true field of battle, and that\r\nto remove herself from it was to abandon the victory to the enemy. Her\r\nretreat, indeed, was an occasion of mourning to the entire Catholic\r\nparty, as well as to the friends of peace and the Spanish alliance, but,\r\non the contrary, of public rejoicing for the friends of the Protestant\r\nalliance. The Count d'Estrade actually went to the Louvre on the part of\r\nthe Prince of Orange, from whom he was accredited, to thank the Regent\r\nofficially for it.\r\n\r\n    [7] \"Allontanar Cheverosa che fa mille cabelle.\" Mazarin's Carnet,\r\n    iii. 81, 82.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse made her way, therefore, to her estate of Duverger,\r\nbetween Tours and Angiers. The deep solitude that there reigned\r\naround her embittered all the more the feeling of defeat. She kept up,\r\nhowever, a brisk correspondence with her stepmother, Madame de\r\nMontbazon--banished to Rochefort; and the two exiled Duchesses mutually\r\nexhorted each other to leave no stone unturned towards effecting the\r\noverthrow of their common enemy. Vanquished at home, Madame de Chevreuse\r\ncentred all her hopes in foreign lands. She revived the friendly\r\nrelations which she had never ceased to cherish with England, Spain, and\r\nthe Low Countries. Her chief prop, the centre and interposer of her\r\nintrigues, was Lord Goring, our ambassador at the French Court; who,\r\nlike his ill-starred master, and more especially his royal mistress,\r\nbelonged to the Spanish party. Croft, an English gentleman who had\r\nfigured in the train of the Duchess some years previously, bestirred\r\nhimself actively and openly in her behalf, whilst the Chevalier de Jars\r\nintrigued warily and in secret for Chateauneuf. Beneath the mantle of\r\nthe English embassy a vast correspondence was carried on between Madame\r\nde Chevreuse, Vendome, Bouillon, and the rest of the _Malcontents_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  CONSEQUENCES OF THE QUARREL BETWEEN THE DUCHESSES DE LONGUEVILLE AND\r\n  DE MONTBAZON.--FATAL DUEL BETWEEN THE DUKE DE GUISE AND COUNT MAURICE\r\n  DE COLIGNY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAS has been said, the 2nd of September, 1643, had been truly a memorable\r\nday in the career of Mazarin, and, indeed, in the annals of France; for\r\nit witnessed the confirming of the royal power, shaken to its base by\r\nthe deaths of Richelieu and Louis XIII., and the ruin of that dangerous\r\nfaction the _Importants_. The intestine discords which threatened the\r\nnew reign were thus forced to await a more favourable opportunity for\r\ndevelopment. They did not raise their heads again until five years\r\nafterwards--on the breaking out of the Fronde, in which they showed\r\nthemselves just the same men as ever, with the same designs, the same\r\npolitics, foreign and domestic; and after raising sanguinary and sterile\r\ncommotions, re-appeared only to break themselves to pieces once more\r\nagainst the genius of Mazarin and the invincible firmness of Anne of\r\nAustria.\r\n\r\nMazarin, therefore, who soon found himself without a rival in the\r\nQueen's good graces, continued steadily to carry on within and without\r\nthe realm the system of his predecessor, and royalty, as well as France,\r\nreckoned upon a succession of halcyon years, thanks to the re-union of\r\nthe Princes of the blood with the Crown, to the tactics and personal\r\nconduct of the Prime Minister, and to his political sagacity, seconded\r\nby the military genius of the Duke d'Enghien. The imprudence of Madame\r\nde Montbazon and her lover Beaufort in the affair of the dropped letters\r\nhad the effect of increasing Mazarin's power incalculably, and that at\r\nthe very moment that a splendid victory gained by the young Duke\r\nd'Enghien had made him and his sister paramount at Court--paramount by a\r\npopularity so universal that it almost made the Queen and her minister\r\ntheir _proteges_ rather than their patrons.\r\n\r\nThe Duke d'Enghien had returned to Paris after Rocroy, and at the end of\r\na campaign in which he had taken a very important stronghold, passed the\r\nRhine with the French army, and carried the war into Germany. The Queen\r\nhad received him as the liberator of France. Mazarin, who looked more to\r\nthe reality than the semblance of power, intimated to the young\r\nconqueror that his sole ambition was to be his chaplain and man of\r\nbusiness with the Queen. At a distance, the Duke d'Enghien had praised\r\neverything that had been done, and came from the camp over head and ears\r\nin love with Madlle. du Vigean, and furious that any one should have\r\ndared to insult a member of his house. He adored his sister, and he had\r\na warm friendship for Coligny.[1] He was aware of and had favoured his\r\npassion for that sister. Engaged himself in a suit as ardent as it was\r\nchaste, he readily comprehended that his beautiful sister might well\r\nhave been not insensible to the fervent assiduities of the brave\r\nMaurice, but he revolted at the thought of the amatory effusions of a\r\nMadame de Fouquerolles being attributed to her, and he assumed a tone in\r\nthe matter which effectually arrested any further insinuation from even\r\nthe most insolent and daring.\r\n\r\n    [1] Grandson of the famous Admiral de Coligny, who perished in the\r\n    massacre of St. Bartholomew.\r\n\r\nAmongst the especial friends of Beaufort and Madame de Montbazon,\r\nforemost of all stood the Duke de Guise.[2] They had manoeuvred to\r\nsecure him as well as the rest of his family to their party, through\r\nGaston, Duke d'Orleans, who had espoused as his second wife a princess\r\nof the house of Lorraine--the lovely Marguerite, sister of Charles IV.\r\nand second daughter of Duke Francis. The Duke de Guise had already\r\nplayed many strange pranks and committed more than one folly, but he had\r\nnot as yet signally failed in any serious enterprise. His incapacity was\r\nnot patent. He had the prestige of his name, youth, good looks, and a\r\ncourage carried even to temerity. The avowed slave of Madame de\r\nMontbazon, he had espoused her quarrel, and to gratify her had joined in\r\npropagating those calumnious reports, but without exhibiting the\r\nviolence of Beaufort, and had remained erect, confronting and defying\r\nthe victorious Condes.\r\n\r\n    [2] Henry, son of Charles de Guise, and grandson of the _Balafre_.\r\n\r\nColigny had had the good sense to keep aloof during the storm, for fear\r\nof still further compromising Madame de Longueville by exhibiting\r\nhimself openly as her champion: but a few months having elapsed, he\r\nthought that he might at last show himself, and, as a certain\r\nauthority[3] tells us, \"the imprisonment of the Duke de Beaufort having\r\ndeprived that noble of the chance of measuring swords with him, he\r\naddressed himself to the Duke de Guise.\" La Rochefoucauld says, \"the\r\nDuke d'Enghien, unable to testify to the Duke de Beaufort, who was in\r\nprison, the resentment he felt at what had passed between Madame de\r\nLongueville and Madame de Montbazon, left Coligny at liberty to fight\r\nwith the Duke de Guise, who had mixed himself up in this affair.\" The\r\nDuke d'Enghien, therefore, knew and approved of what Coligny did. In\r\nfact, he found himself without an adversary in the affair of sufficient\r\nrank to justify a prince of the blood in drawing his sword against him.\r\nSo far as regards Madame de Longueville, it is absurd to suppose that,\r\ndesirous of vengeance, she it was who had urged on Coligny, for\r\neverybody ascribed to her a line of conduct characterised by great\r\nmoderation, as contrasted with that of the Princess de Conde. Far from\r\nenvenoming the quarrel, she wished to hush it up, and Madame de\r\nMotteville thus significantly alludes to that fact: \"The enmity she bore\r\nMadame de Montbazon being proportionate to the love she bore her\r\nhusband, it did not carry her so far but that she found it more a propos\r\nto dissimulate that outrage than otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n    [3] An inedited Memoir upon the Regency.\r\n\r\nLa Rochefoucauld gives some particulars which explain what follows.\r\nColigny, just risen out of a long illness, was still very much\r\nenfeebled, and, moreover, not very \"skilful of fence.\" Such was his\r\ncondition when, as the champion of Madame de Longueville, he confronted\r\nthe Duke de Guise in mortal duel, whilst the latter, like most heroes of\r\nthe parade-ground, possessed rare cunning at carte and tierce. With\r\nregard to the seconds chosen, they are in every respect worthy of\r\nnotice. In those days, seconds were witnesses of the duel in which they\r\nthemselves fought. Coligny selected as his second, and to give the\r\nchallenge, as was then the custom, Godefroi, Count d'Estrades, a man of\r\ncool and tried courage. The Duke de Guise's second was his equerry, the\r\nMarquis de Bridieu, a Limousin gentleman and brave officer, faithfully\r\nattached to the house of Lorraine, who, in 1650, admirably defended\r\nGuise against the Spanish army and against Turenne, and for that brave\r\ndefence, during which there were twenty-four days of open trenches, he\r\nwas made lieutenant-general.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged that the affair should come off at the Place Royale--the\r\nusual arena for those sort of encounters, and which had been a hundred\r\ntimes stained with the best blood of France. The mansions around the\r\nPlace Royale were then tenanted by ladies of the highest rank and\r\nfashion, amongst the rest, Marguerite, Duchess de Rohan, Madame de\r\nGuemene, Madame de Chaulnes, Madame de St. Geran, Madame de Sable, the\r\nCountess de St. Maure, and many others, under the influence of whose\r\nbright eyes those volatile and valiant French gentlemen delighted to\r\ncross swords. And there many a noble form had been struck down never to\r\nrise again, and many a noble heart had throbbed its last. During the\r\nfirst quarter of the seventeenth century, the duel was a custom at once\r\nuseful and disastrous, inasmuch as it kept up the warlike spirit of the\r\nnobles, but which mowed them down as fast as war itself, and but too\r\nfrequently for frivolous causes. To draw swords for trifles had become\r\nthe obligatory accompaniment of good manners; and as gallantry had its\r\nfinished fops, so the duel had its refined rufflers. In the\r\ncomparatively short period of a few years, nine hundred gentlemen\r\nperished in these combats. To stop this scourge, Richelieu issued a\r\nroyal edict, which punished death by death, and sent the offenders from\r\nthe Place Royale to the Place de Greve. On this head Richelieu showed\r\nhimself inflexible, and the examples of Montmorency-Bouteville, beheaded\r\nwith his second, the Count Deschappelles, for having challenged Beuvron\r\nand fought with him on the Place Royale at mid-day, impressed a\r\nsalutary terror, and rendered infraction of the edict very rare.\r\nColigny, however, braved everything; he challenged Guise, and on the\r\nappointed day the two noble adversaries, accompanied by their seconds,\r\nD'Estrades and Bridieu, met upon the Place Royale.\r\n\r\nOf this memorable duel, thanks to contemporary memoirs as well as\r\nvarious kinds of MSS., the minutest details have been preserved.\r\n\r\nOn the 12th of December, 1643, D'Estrades went in the morning to call\r\nout the Duke de Guise on the part of Coligny. The rendezvous was fixed\r\nfor the same day, at three o'clock in the afternoon, at the Place\r\nRoyale. The two adversaries did not appear abroad during the whole\r\nmorning, and at three o'clock they were on the ground. A sentence is\r\nascribed to Guise which invests the scene with an unwonted grandeur, and\r\narrays for the last time in bitterest animosity and deadly antagonism\r\nthe two most illustrious representatives of the League wars in the\r\npersons of their descendants. On unsheathing his sword Guise said to\r\nColigny: \"We are about to decide the old feud of our two houses, and to\r\nsee what a difference there is between the blood of Guise and that of\r\nColigny.\"\r\n\r\nColigny's only reply was to deal his adversary a long lunge; but, weak\r\nas he was, his rearward foot failed him, and he sank upon his knee.\r\nGuise advanced upon him and set his foot upon his sword, in such manner\r\nas though he would have said, \"I do not desire to kill you, but to treat\r\nyou as you deserve, for having presumed to address yourself to a prince\r\nof such birth as mine, without his having given you just cause,\"--and he\r\nstruck him with the flat of his sword-blade. Coligny, furious, collected\r\nhis strength, threw himself backwards, disengaged his sword, and\r\nrecommenced the strife. In this second bout, Guise was slightly wounded\r\nin the shoulder, and Coligny in the hand. At length, Guise, in making\r\nanother thrust at his adversary, grasped his sword-blade, by which his\r\nhand was slightly cut, but, wresting it from Coligny's grasp, dealt him\r\na desperate thrust in the arm which put him _hors de combat_. Meanwhile\r\nD'Estrades and Bridieu had grievously wounded each other.\r\n\r\nSuch was the issue of that memorable duel--the last, it appears, of the\r\nfamous encounters on the Place Royale. We thus see that, though cowed,\r\nthe French noblesse had not been tamed by Richelieu's solemn edict. This\r\nlast duel did very little honour to Coligny, and almost everybody took\r\npart with the Duke de Guise. The Queen manifested very lively\r\ndispleasure at the violation of the edict, and the Duke d'Orleans, urged\r\nthereto by his wife and the Lorraine family, made a loud outcry. The\r\nPrince and Princess de Conde also found themselves compelled to declare\r\nagainst Coligny--doubly in the wrong, both because he had been the\r\nchallenger and been unfortunate in the result. Proof that there was an\r\nunderstanding between Coligny and the Duke d'Enghien is evident from the\r\nlatter not deserting the unlucky champion of his sister, that he\r\nreceived the wounded man into his house at Paris, afterwards at Saint\r\nMaur, and that he did not cease from surrounding him with his protection\r\nand care in spite of his father, the Prince de Conde. When the matter\r\nwas referred to the Parliament, conformably to the edict, and the two\r\nadversaries were summoned to appear, the Duke de Guise announced his\r\nintention of repairing to the chamber with a retinue of princes and\r\ngreat nobles; whilst, on his side, the Duke d'Enghien threatened to\r\nescort his friend after the same fashion. But the initiative\r\nproceedings were stayed through the deplorable condition into which poor\r\nColigny was known to have fallen.\r\n\r\nThat unfortunate young man languished for some months, and died in the\r\nlatter part of May, 1644, alike in consequence of his wounds and of\r\ndespair for having so badly sustained the cause of his own house, as\r\nwell as that of Madame de Longueville.\r\n\r\nThis affair, with all its dramatic features and tragical termination,\r\ncreated an immense and painful impression not only in Paris, but\r\nthroughout France. It momentarily awakened party feelings which had for\r\nsome time slumbered, and suspended the festivals of the winter of 1644.\r\nIt not only occupied the families more closely concerned and the Court,\r\nbut forcibly affected the whole of the highest class of society, and\r\nlong remained the absorbing topic of every saloon. It may be readily\r\nconceived that the story in spreading thus widely became enlarged with\r\nimaginary incidents one after another. At first, it was supposed that\r\nMadame de Longueville was in love with Coligny. That was necessary to\r\ngive the greater interest to the narrative. From thence came the next\r\ninvention, that she herself had armed Coligny's hand, and that\r\nD'Estrades, charged to challenge the Duke de Guise, having remarked to\r\nColigny that the Duke might probably repudiate the injurious words\r\nattributed to him, and that honour would thus be satisfied, Coligny had\r\nthereupon replied: \"That is not the question. I pledged my word to\r\nMadame de Longueville to fight him on the Place Royale, and I cannot\r\nfail in that promise.\"[4] There was no stopping a cavalier in such a\r\nchivalrous course as that, and Madame de Longueville would not have been\r\nthe sister of the victor of Rocroy--a heroine worthy of sustaining\r\ncomparison with those of Spain, who beheld their lovers die at their\r\nfeet in the tournament--had she not been present at the duel between\r\nGuise and Coligny. It is asserted, therefore, that on the 12th of\r\nDecember she was stationed in an hotel on the Place Royale belonging to\r\nthe Duchess de Rohan, and that there, concealed behind a window-curtain,\r\nshe had witnessed the discomfiture of her _preux chevalier_.\r\n\r\n    [4] Mad. de Motteville.\r\n\r\nThen, as now, it was verse--that is to say, the ballad--which set its\r\nseal on the popular incident of the moment. When the event was an\r\nunlucky one, the song was a burlesquely pathetic complaint, and always\r\nwith a vein of raillery running through it. Such was the effusion with\r\nwhich every _ruelle_ rang, and it was really set to music, for the\r\nnotation is still to be found in the _Recueil de Chansons notees_,\r\npreserved at the Arsenal at Paris. It ran thus:--\r\n\r\n  \"Essuyez vos beaux yeux,\r\n   Madame de Longueville,\r\n   Coligny se porte mieux.\r\n   S'il a demande la vie,\r\n   Ne l'en blamez nullement;\r\n   Car c'est pour etre votre amant\r\n   Qu'il veut vivre eternellement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  THE DUCHESS DE LONGUEVILLE AND THE DUKE DE LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHAT Madame de Longueville witnessed the duel on the Place Royale seems\r\nto rest on no reliable authority. Such a trait is so utterly at variance\r\nwith her character that its attribution would impute to her the manners\r\nof a semi-Italianised princess of the Valois race. There are besides no\r\nsufficient grounds for believing that her affections had for a moment\r\nbeen given to Coligny, though doubtless her innate tenderness must have\r\nbeen touched by his chivalrous love and devotion. Miossens, afterwards\r\nbetter known as Marshal d'Albret, next tried in vain to win a heart\r\nwhich had hitherto appeared insensible to the master-passion, but after\r\nan obstinate persistence was ultimately constrained to relinquish all\r\nhope. When, in 1645, M. de Longueville went as minister-plenipotentiary\r\nto the Congress of Muenster, the young Duchess remained in Paris, her\r\nelement being still the social sphere of the Court solely--a taste for\r\npolitical life not having yet been developed through the impulse of her\r\naffections. Let us here add that, notwithstanding the almost unanimous\r\nassertion of contemporaries at this period that even women could not\r\nbehold Madame de Longueville without admiration, the heart of this\r\npreeminently gifted creature seems amidst the universal homage to have\r\nbeen proof against all and every repeated assault. Anne of Austria\r\nloved her but little, partly through a jealous feeling created by her\r\nsingular beauty, partly from her great reputation for wit, and also from\r\nher perpetual wranglings for precedence with other princesses of the\r\nblood. In fact, in order to lose no tittle of the prerogatives derived\r\nfrom her birth, Madame de Longueville had obtained a royal brevet from\r\nthe king which maintained her in the rank which she would have otherwise\r\nlost by her marriage. A pride so exacting does not appear to agree with\r\nthe peculiar nonchalance that was one of her striking characteristics;\r\nbut, later in life, when she had become devout and penitent, she took\r\ncare to explain that seeming contradiction. \"I have been defined,\" said\r\nshe, \"as having, as it were, two individualities of opposite nature in\r\nme, and that I could interchange them at any moment; but that arose from\r\nthe different situations in which I was placed, for I was dead, like\r\nunto the dead, to aught which slightly affected me, and keenly alive to\r\nthe smallest things which interested me.\" Reading and study were never\r\namong the things which stirred her into animation. Entirely occupied\r\nwith her fascinations and individual sentiments, at no period of her\r\nlife did she ever think of repairing the early neglect of her education.\r\nIn this respect she was inferior, on the authority even of her\r\napologists, to many ladies of the Court and city. Intoxicated as she had\r\nbeen by the fumes of the incense which flattery had wafted around her in\r\nthe circle of the Hotel de Rambouillet, she probably had no perception\r\nof her failings on that essential point. The spontaneity of her wit, her\r\nnatural aptitude to comprehend and decide upon all sorts of questions,\r\nmade up for her deficiency in that kind of information which is acquired\r\nfrom books and other modes of study, and often stood her in good stead,\r\nboth on the part of her detractors and of her partisans, of the lofty\r\ncharacteristics of \"great genius.\" M. Cousin, who is by no means severe\r\nas regards the errors or demerits of the Duchess, says that \"she did not\r\nknow how to write.\" Mademoiselle de Montpensier and Madame de\r\nMotteville, however, both express the very opposite opinion. The first\r\nremarks, speaking of the Countess de Maure:--\"The precision and the\r\npolish of her style would be incomparable if Madame de Longueville had\r\nnever written.\" The second declares that \"this lady has ever written as\r\nwell as any one living.\" The fact is, so far as may be judged from those\r\nof her letters which have come down to us, that Madame de Longueville's\r\nstyle bore the reflex of her conversation: there are some passages very\r\nremarkable in their force, some phrases altogether trite and\r\ninsignificant. This opinion is quite beside the consideration of her\r\ndiction in a grammatical point of view. In her written as in her spoken\r\nlanguage, she seems to have been impassive or to have kindled into\r\nanimation according as her thoughts were \"dead or living,\" to use her\r\nown phrase. Speaking and writing, however, are two very different\r\nthings, both requiring an especial cultivation; and as Madame de\r\nLongueville was defective in anything like what is termed \"regular\r\neducation\" or \"sound instruction,\" that fact became apparent so soon as\r\nshe took her pen in hand. Her great natural endowments shone on paper\r\nwith difficulty, through faults of every kind which escaped her notice.\r\nIt is really no small gift to be able to express one's sentiments and\r\nideas in their natural order, and with all their true and various\r\nshades, in terms neither too homely nor far-fetched, or which neither\r\nenfeeble nor exaggerate them. It is by no means rare to meet with men in\r\nsociety remarkable for intelligence, nerve, and grace when they speak,\r\nbut who become unintelligible when they commit their thoughts to\r\nwriting. The fact is, that writing is an art--a very difficult art, and\r\none which must be carefully learned. Madame de Longueville was ignorant\r\nof this, as were some of the most eminent women of her time. There\r\nexists unquestionable evidence to prove that the Princess Palatine was a\r\nperson of large intelligence, who was able to hold her own with men of\r\nthe greatest capacity. De Retz and Bossuet tell us so. Some letters of\r\nthe Palatine, however, are extant in which, whilst there is no lack of\r\nsolidity, refinement, and ingenuity of thought, it will be seen that\r\nthey often abound with errors, obscure phraseology, and not unfrequently\r\noutrageously violate even the commonest rules of orthography. It must\r\nnot, however, by any means be inferred from this that the Palatine had\r\nnot a mind of the first order, but only that she had not been trained to\r\nrender clearly and fittingly her ideas and sentiments in writing. Madame\r\nde Longueville had been no better taught. Therefore all that has been\r\nsaid about her on this score must be restricted, alike as to the defects\r\nof her education and the brilliancy of her genius. With those\r\nFrenchwomen who have written at once largely and loosely, it is pleasant\r\nto contrast their contemporaries, Madame de Sevigne and Madame la\r\nFayette, both of whom always wrote well.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, these two admirable ladies had received quite\r\nanother sort of education to that of Madame de Longueville. They had had\r\nthe advantage of being instructed by men of letters skilled in the art\r\nof teaching. Menage was the chief instructor both of Mademoiselle de\r\nRabutin and Mademoiselle de Lavergne--to call those accomplished\r\nletter-writers by their maiden names. Menage trained them carefully in\r\ncomposition, correcting rigidly their themes, pointing out their errors,\r\ncultivating their happy instincts, and modelling and polishing their\r\nvein and style. That talented tutor appears also to have been their\r\nplatonic adorer--more platonic indeed than he desired. In his verses he\r\ncelebrated by turns _la formosissima Laverna_ and _la bellissima\r\nMarchesa di Sevigni_, and his lessons were doubtless given _con amore_.\r\n\r\nNature had been lavish indeed in all her gifts to the latter, giving her\r\na precision and solidity allied to an inexhaustible playfulness and\r\nsparkling vivacity. Art, in her, wedded to genius, resulted in that\r\nincomparable epistolary style which left Balzac and Voiture far away\r\nbehind her, and which Voltaire himself even has not surpassed.\r\n\r\nWe must now speak of him who was destined to bias, sway, and finally\r\ndetermine the future course of Madame de Longueville's life through the\r\nconquest of her heart and mind--La Rochefoucauld--the man who induced\r\nher to embark with him on the stormy sea of politics, whose irresistible\r\ntide swept her past the landmarks of loyalty and reputability to make\r\nshipwreck, amongst the rocks and shoals of civil war, of fame, fortune,\r\nand domestic happiness.\r\n\r\nUp to the moment of her appearance on the scene of party strife in\r\nconnection with La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Longueville had not achieved\r\nmuch _political_ notoriety. Neither had her fair fame been compromised\r\nby the very insignificant gallantry of a long train of court danglers,\r\nnor through her involuntary participation in the affair of the letters\r\nwith Madame de Montbazon. She could scarcely fail to be touched by the\r\ndevotion of Coligny, who had shed his blood to avenge her of the outrage\r\nof that vindictive woman. For a moment, it is true, she had listened\r\ncarelessly and harmlessly to the attention of the brave and intellectual\r\nMiossens. Still later she compromised herself somewhat with the Duke de\r\nNemours; but the only man she truly loved with heart and soul was La\r\nRochefoucauld. To him she devoted herself wholly; for him she sacrificed\r\neverything--duty, interest, repose, reputation. For him she staked her\r\nfortune and her life. Through him she exhibited the most equivocal and\r\nmost contradictory conduct. It was La Rochefoucauld who caused her to\r\ntake part in the Fronde; who, as he willed, made her advance or recede;\r\nwho united her to, or separated her from, her family; who governed her\r\nabsolutely. In a word, she consented to be in his hand merely an heroic\r\ninstrument. Pride and passion had doubtless something to do with this\r\nlife of adventure and that contempt of peril. But of what stamp must\r\nhave been that soul which could find consolation in all this? And, as\r\noften happens, the man to whom she thus devoted herself was not wholly\r\nworthy of her. He had infinite spirit; but he was coldly calculating,\r\nprofoundly selfish, meanly ambitious. He measured others by himself. He\r\nwas naturally as subtle in evil, as she was disposed spontaneously to\r\nvirtue. Full of finesse in his self-love and in the pursuit of his own\r\ninterest, he was, in reality, the least chivalrous of his sex, although\r\nhe affected all the appearance of the loftiest chivalry. In his\r\n_liaison_ with Madame de Longueville he made love the slave of ambition.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary to touch only slightly upon his career antecedent\r\nto this period. Francis, the sixth seigneur and second Duke de la\r\nRochefoucauld, was born 15th December 1613. Little is recorded of his\r\nearly years, he himself having given no details about them. We only know\r\nthat he was very imperfectly educated, his father being desirous that\r\nhe should early adopt the profession of arms. Himself enjoying royal\r\nfavour in the highest degree, his eldest son, the young Prince de\r\nMarsillac, profitably felt its influence; for, as early as 1626, he\r\ncommanded as _mestre-de-camp_ the Auvergne regiment of cavalry at the\r\nsiege of Casal. He took an active part in the _Day of Dupes_, the period\r\nat which his memoirs commence. Two years previously, in 1628, he had\r\nmarried at Mirebeau a rich and beautiful heiress of Burgundy, Andree de\r\nVivonne, only daughter of Andre de Vivonne, Baron of Berandiere and\r\nChasteigneraye, Grand Falconer of France, Captain in the Guards of the\r\nQueen-Mother, Marie de' Medici, Councillor of State, and one of the most\r\ntrusty followers of Henry IV. The Prince de Marsillac was at first in\r\ngreat favour at Court, notwithstanding his father's misconduct, but he\r\nsuddenly compromised himself in a very imprudent way. Closely intimate\r\nwith that virtuous maid-of-honour, Marie de Hautefort, whom the\r\nsaturnine Louis XIII. loved as passionately as his peculiar temperament\r\npermitted, and also with Mademoiselle de Chemerault, as lovely as she\r\nwas witty, he was by them hurried into a blind devotion to the cause of\r\ntheir unhappy mistress and queen, Anne of Austria, \"the only party,\"\r\nsays he, with unusual candour, \"that I ever honestly followed.\" And very\r\nsoon his confidential relations with the persecuted princess became so\r\nmarked as necessarily to excite Richelieu's suspicions, the more so that\r\nhe ventured to speak of the Cardinal's administration in the boldest\r\nterms. His friends advised him to retire from Court, at least\r\ntemporarily; but, as he wished to employ his time usefully, he joined as\r\na volunteer the army of Marshal de Chastillon, who, with Marshal de la\r\nMeilleraye, beat Prince Thomas of Savoy at Avein. After behaving with\r\ndistinction there, he returned, when the campaign was over, to Court,\r\nexhibiting a conduct still more independent, and which resulted in\r\nforcing him to rejoin his father at Blois.\r\n\r\nIt was through the proximity of his father's chateau of Verteuil to\r\nPoitiers, where the Duchess de Chevreuse was then living in banishment\r\nfrom Court, that the Prince de Marsillac first came to ally himself with\r\nthe illustrious political adventuress. At the time when La Rochefoucauld\r\nobtained political notoriety, a crisis occurred in France in national\r\nmanners, sentiments, and feelings. The nobles, long kept under by the\r\nstrong hand of Richelieu, were again rising into faction, and a spirit\r\nof intrigue had seized upon everyone.\r\n\r\nAlthough still young, Rochefoucauld had renounced enterprises in which\r\nthe heart is alone concerned. No longer engrossed with love, he was\r\nwholly given up to ambition; and in order to avenge himself of the Queen\r\nand Mazarin, who had not in his opinion evinced sufficient generosity\r\ntowards him to satisfy this later passion, he did not hesitate to fling\r\nhimself headlong into partisan intrigue and strife which ended in civil\r\nwar. To render himself the more formidable, he was above all desirous of\r\nsecuring to his party the master-mind of Conde; and as Madame de\r\nLongueville enjoyed the entire confidence of her favourite brother, and\r\nhad great influence with him, the natural result was that in due course\r\nLa Rochefoucauld made persistent love to the lovely Duchess. Seduced by\r\nthe chivalrous manners and romantic antecedents of his youth, and\r\nyielding partly to the occasion, partly to the obstinate persistence of\r\nthe suit, and some little perhaps to the maternal blood in her veins,\r\nMadame de Longueville at length surrendered her heart to the daring\r\naspirant. She could no longer plead early youth as an excuse, for she\r\nhad already numbered twenty-nine summers, and was only distant by a very\r\nsmall span from that formidable epoch in woman's life which a\r\ndiscriminating writer of the present day has happily termed the\r\n_crisis_. That turning point in the Duchess's career was destined to\r\nprove fatal to her, and the crisis was exactly such as that of which, in\r\nthe case of another celebrated woman, M. Feillet has given a lucid\r\nanalysis--the crisis brought about by an irresistible passion. Let us\r\nbeware of hastily applying to Madame de Longueville that maxim of her\r\ncynical lover: \"Women often think they still love him whom they no\r\nlonger really love. The opportunity of an intrigue, the mental emotion\r\nto which gallantry gives birth, natural inclination to the pleasure of\r\nbeing beloved, and the pain of refusing the lover, together persuade\r\nthem that they cherish a genuine passion when it is nothing more than\r\nmere coquetry.\" Better had it been both for herself and for us to\r\nbelieve that she had only so loved.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and intelligence of the Duchess de Longueville formed\r\ncertainly, at the commencement, a large share in the calculating lover's\r\ndetermination to seek a _liaison_ with the Duke d'Enghien's sister. The\r\ncrowd of admirers was great around her, and that spectacle of itself\r\nserved to inflame the ambition of M. de Marsillac: subsequent\r\nreflection, doubtless, must have redoubled his ardour to achieve the\r\ntwofold conquest, in love and party. The Count de Miossens was then\r\npaying the most assiduous court to Madame de Longueville; he was very\r\nintimately connected with Marsillac, to whom indeed he was nearly\r\nrelated, and whom he kept well acquainted with the course of his amours.\r\nHis suit to the lovely Duchess proving, as has been said, entirely\r\nunsuccessful, Miossens eventually left the field clear to Marsillac, the\r\nbrave and simple soldier giving place to the self-seeking man of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  THE DUCHESS DE LONGUEVILLE DRAWN INTO THE VORTEX OF POLITICS AND CIVIL\r\n  WAR BY HER LOVE FOR LA ROCHEFOUCAULD.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE have glanced rapidly over the fairest period of Madame de\r\nLongueville's youth, over those years wherein the splendour of her\r\nsuccess in the ranks of fashion was not obtained at the expense of her\r\nvirtue. The time approaches in which she is about to yield to the\r\nmanners of her age, and to the long-combatted wants of her heart. The\r\nlove which she inspired in others, she is, in turn, about to feel\r\nherself, and it is to engage her, at the age of twenty-eight or\r\ntwenty-nine, in a fatal connection, which will make her unmindful of all\r\nher conjugal duties, and turn her most brilliant qualities against\r\nherself, against her family, and against France.\r\n\r\nLet us now relate briefly what we know of Madame de Longueville from the\r\nmoment of our last mention of her up to the commencement of 1648. There\r\nis nothing recorded which can authorise the supposition that before the\r\nclose of 1647 Madame de Longueville had ever passed the limits of that\r\nnoble and graceful gallantry which she saw everywhere held in honour,\r\nthe praises of which she heard celebrated at the Hotel de Rambouillet as\r\nwell as at the Hotel de Conde, in the great verse of Corneille and in\r\nthe turgid effusions of Voiture. At the time of the duel between Guise\r\nand Coligny, in 1644, she had seen her twenty-fifth summer. Each\r\nsucceeding year seemed only to enhance the power of her charms, and that\r\npower she delighted in exhibiting. A thousand adorers pressed around\r\nher. Coligny was, perhaps, nearest to her heart, but had not, however,\r\ntouched it. But one cannot, with impunity, trifle with love. That tragic\r\nadventure of the eldest of the Chatillons perishing, in the flower of\r\nhis youth, by the hand of the eldest of the Guises was quickly echoed by\r\nsong and romance through every _salon_, and cast a gloom upon the\r\ndestiny of Madame de Longueville, and gave her, at an early period, a\r\nfame at once aristocratic and popular, which prepared her wonderfully to\r\nplay a great part in that other tragi-comedy, heroic and gallant, called\r\nthe Fronde. The glory of her brother was reflected upon her, and she\r\nresponded to it somewhat by her own success at Court and in the\r\n_salons_. She acquired more and more the manners of the times. Coquetry\r\nand witty talk formed her sole occupation. Her delicate condition not\r\npermitting her to accompany M. de Longueville to Muenster, in June, 1645,\r\nshe remained in Paris. It was the place above all others in which she\r\ndelighted, and whether her heart had received some slight wound, or\r\nwhether it was still entirely whole, it is clear that she was not very\r\nglad nor greatly charmed to find herself, after her accouchement in the\r\nspring of 1646, under the cold, grey sky of Westphalia, again beside a\r\nhusband who was not, as Retz says, the most agreeable man to her in the\r\nworld. It is not difficult to divine the feelings with which that petted\r\nbeauty of the Hotel de Rambouillet must have left Corneille, Voiture,\r\nand all the elegancies and refinements of life, to take up her abode at\r\nMunster amongst a set of foreign diplomatists only speaking German or\r\nLatin. To her it was doubly an exile, for her native soil was not\r\nmerely France--but Paris, the Court, the Hotel de Conde, Chantilly, the\r\nPlace Royale, the Rue St. Thomas du Louvre.[1] However, there was\r\nnothing for it but to obey the marital summons, and to set off with her\r\nstep-daughter, Mademoiselle de Longueville, who was already more than\r\ntwenty years of age. The Duchess quitted Paris on the 20th of June,\r\n1646, with a numerous escort under the command of Montigny, lieutenant\r\nof M. de Longueville's guards. The entire journey from Paris to Munster\r\nwas a continual ovation. The Duke went as far as Wesel to meet her.\r\nTurenne, who then commanded on the Rhine, treated her to the spectacle\r\nof an army drawn up in order of battle, and which he manoeuvred for\r\nher amusement. Was it on that occasion that the great captain, well\r\nknown to have been always impressionable to female beauty, received the\r\nardent impulse which was renewed at Stenay in 1650, and which,\r\ngraciously but prudently acknowledged by Madame de Longueville, always\r\nremained a close and tender tie between them? On the 22nd of July she\r\nmade her triumphal entry into Munster. During the entire autumn of 1646\r\nand the winter of 1647 she was really the Queen of the Congress. Her\r\nbeauty and grace of manner won homage equally from the grave\r\ndiplomatists as from the great commanders who were there assembled.\r\n\r\n    [1] In which the Hotel de Rambouillet was situate.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Duchess dissembled her ennui with that politeness and\r\ngentleness peculiar to herself, after the lapse of a few months she had\r\nhad enough of her brilliant exile. In the winter of 1647 there were two\r\nreasons for her return to France. Her father, the Prince de Conde, had\r\ndied towards the close of December, 1646, to the great loss of his\r\nfamily and France, the consequences of which were somewhat later vividly\r\nfelt. Moreover, Madame de Longueville had become _enceinte_, at Muenster\r\nfor the third time, and it being her mother's wish that her accouchement\r\nshould take place near her, M. de Longueville was compelled to consent\r\nto his wife's departure for Paris.\r\n\r\nHer return to France, at first to Chantilly, and next to Paris, in the\r\nmonth of May, 1647, was quite another sort of triumph to that of her\r\njourney to the Rhine and Holland, and her sojourn at Muenster. She found\r\nthe crowd of her adorers more numerous and attentive than ever, and in\r\nthe foremost rank her younger brother, the Prince de Conti, just fresh\r\nfrom college, was taking his first lessons of life in the wider range of\r\nthe great world.\r\n\r\nShortly after her accouchement, the Duchess, who during her sojourn\r\namongst the plenipotentiaries charged with negotiating the treaty of\r\nWestphalia, had acquired a taste, there seems little doubt, for\r\npolitical discussions and speculations, first began to manifest an\r\ninclination to mix herself up with state affairs. There was little\r\ndifficulty in her doing so. The mission which the Duke de Longueville\r\ncontinued to fulfil in Germany, the continued favour enjoyed by the\r\nPrincess de Conde, the ever-increasing influence which the Duke\r\nd'Enghien--recently through his father's death become Prince de\r\nConde--had acquired by his repeated victories, all these advantages,\r\njoined to the prestige of the personal charms of Madame de Longueville,\r\nplaced this latter in a position to take the foremost part in the civil\r\nwar about to break out.\r\n\r\nThe Court and Paris were then occupied with festivals and diversions,\r\nwhich all were eager to share with Madame de Longueville. To please the\r\nQueen, Mazarin multiplied balls and operas. At a great expense he sent\r\nto Italy for artists, singers, male and female, who represented the\r\nopera of _Orpheus_, the machinery and decorations of which are said to\r\nhave cost more than 400,000 livres. The Queen delighted in these\r\nspectacles. France also, as though inspired by its increasing grandeur,\r\ntook pleasure in the magnificence of its government, and seconded it by\r\nredoubling its own luxury and magnificence. The pleasures of wit\r\noccupied the first rank. The Hotel de Rambouillet, near its decline, was\r\nshedding its last rays. Madame de Longueville reigned there as well as\r\nin all the best circles of Paris; and it must be confessed, with her\r\ngood qualities she had also some of the defects of the best\r\n_precieuses_. The following is the picture which Madame de Motteville\r\nhas traced of her person, of the turn of her mind, of her occupation, of\r\nher reputation, and of that of the whole house of Conde, at this period,\r\nwhich may be considered as the most felicitous of her life: \"This\r\nprincess, who during her absence reigned in her family, and whose\r\napprobation was sought as though she were a real sovereign, did not\r\nfail, on her return to Paris, to appear in greater splendour than when\r\nshe left it. The friendship entertained for her by the Prince, her\r\nbrother, authorizing her actions and her manners, the greatness of her\r\nbeauty and of her mind increased so much the cabal of her family, that\r\nshe was not long at Court without almost entirely engrossing it. She\r\nbecame the object of all desires: her clique was the centre of all\r\nintrigues, and those whom she loved became also the favourites of\r\nfortune.... Her intelligence, her wit, and the high opinion entertained\r\nfor her discernment, won for her the admiration of all good people, who\r\nwere persuaded that her esteem alone was enough to give them reputation.\r\nIf, in this way, she governed people's minds, she was not less\r\nsuccessful by means of her beauty; for although she had suffered from\r\nthe small-pox since the Regency, and although she had lost somewhat of\r\nthe perfection of her complexion, the splendour of her charms excited a\r\npowerful influence upon those who saw her; and she possessed especially,\r\nin the highest degree, what in the Spanish language is expressed by\r\nthose words, _donayre, brio, y bizarrie_ (gallant air). She had an\r\nadmirable form, and her person possessed a charm whose power extended\r\nover our own sex. It was impossible to see her without loving her, and\r\nwithout desiring to please her.\" Some shadows, however, slightly tone\r\ndown this otherwise brilliant portraiture. \"She was then too much\r\nengrossed with her own sentiments, which passed for infallible rules\r\nwhile they were not always so, and there was too much affectation in her\r\nmanner of speaking and acting, whose greatest beauty was attributable to\r\ndelicacy of thought and correctness of reasoning. She appeared\r\nconstrained, and the keen raillery exercised by herself and her\r\ncourtiers often fell upon those who, while rendering her their homage,\r\nfelt, to their mortification, that honest sincerity, which ought to be\r\nobserved in polite society, was apparently banished from hers. The\r\nvirtues and qualities of the most excellent creatures are mingled with\r\nthings opposed to them: all men partake of this clay from which they\r\nderive their origin, and God alone is perfect.... In short it may be\r\nsaid that at this time all greatness, all glory, and all gallantry were\r\nconcentrated in the family of Bourbon, of which the Prince de Conde was\r\nthe illustrious head, and that fortune was not considered a desirable\r\nthing if it did not emanate from their hands.\"\r\n\r\nBut, unhappily, frivolous pastimes, of a nature both innocent and\r\ndangerous, now wholly engrossed Madame de Longueville. She was\r\nsurrounded by all the prosperities and all the felicities of this life.\r\nEverything conspired in her favour, or rather against her--the triumphs\r\nof mind as well as those of beauty, the continually increasing glory of\r\nher paternal house, the intoxication of her vanity, the secret\r\npromptings of her heart. The trial was too much for her, and she\r\nsuccumbed to it. In the enchanted circle in which she moved, more than\r\none adorer attracted her attention; and one of them succeeded in winning\r\nher affections, according to all appearances, at the close of 1647, or\r\nat the commencement of 1648. She was then about twenty-nine.\r\n\r\nFrancois, Prince de Marsillac, without being very handsome, was well\r\nformed and very agreeable. As De Retz says, he was not a warrior,\r\nalthough he was a very good soldier. What distinguished him especially\r\nwas his wit. Of this he possessed an infinite fund, of the finest and\r\nmost delicate. His conversation was gentle, easy, insinuating; and his\r\nmanners were at once the most natural and most polished. He had a lofty\r\nair. In him vanity supplied the place of ambition. At an early age he\r\nshowed a fondness for distinction and for intrigues. Profoundly selfish,\r\nand having succeeded in acquiring a knowledge of himself, and in\r\nreducing to theory his nature, his character, and his tastes, he set out\r\nwith very contrary appearances, and those chivalrous manners affected by\r\nthe _Importants_. One of his first connections, as we have seen, was\r\nwith Madame de Chevreuse, who secured him to Queen Anne. When the death\r\nof Louis XIII. had placed the supreme authority in her hands, he\r\nimagined that his fortune was made. He sought successively various\r\nimportant offices which the Queen could not grant, whatever liking she\r\nmight have entertained for him. Having tried several schemes and failed\r\nin all, the Queen applied herself to soothing his disappointments, by\r\nbehaviour so tender as to retain him, as would now be said, in a\r\nmoderate opposition, and keep him from taking part in the violence of\r\nBeaufort. He was not then covered with the disgrace of the _Importants_,\r\nthough he shared it to a certain extent; and he did not cease to be, or\r\nseem to be, very much attached, not to the government, but to the person\r\nof the Queen. He looked continually for some great favour at her hands.\r\nThese favours not arriving, he determined to procure through\r\nintimidation what his self-seeking fidelity had not been able to secure\r\nfor him.\r\n\r\nIt was during this state of his feelings that he met Madame de\r\nLongueville, on her return from Munster, surrounded by the most earnest\r\nadmirers. The Count de Miossens, afterwards Marshal d'Albret--handsome,\r\nbrave, full of wit and talent, as enterprising in love as in war--was\r\npaying her a very zealous court. La Rochefoucauld persuaded Miossens,\r\nwho was one of his friends, that, after all, if he should overcome the\r\nresistance of Madame de Longueville, it would only be a victory\r\nflattering to his vanity, whilst that he, La Rochefoucauld, would be\r\nable to turn it to a very good account. This was certainly a very\r\nconvincing and heroic reason for falling in love! We, however, do no\r\nmore than transfer, with the utmost exactness, a statement made by\r\nRochefoucauld himself, which we will now quote word for word: \"So much\r\nunprofitable labour and so much weariness, finally gave me other\r\nthoughts, and led me to attempt dangerous ways in order to testify my\r\nhostility to the Queen and Cardinal Mazarin. The beauty of Madame de\r\nLongueville, her wit, and the charms of her person, attached to her all\r\nwho could hope for her favour. Many men and women of quality strove to\r\nplease her; and besides all this, Madame de Longueville was then upon\r\nsuch good terms with all her house, and so tenderly beloved by the Duke\r\nd'Enghien, her brother, that the esteem and friendship of this prince\r\nmight be counted upon by any one who enjoyed the favour of his sister.\r\nMany persons vainly attempted this game, mingling other sentiments with\r\nthose of ambition. Miossens, who afterwards became Marshal of France,\r\npersisted in it longest, but with similar success. I was one of his\r\nintimate friends, and he told me his designs. They soon fell to the\r\nground of themselves. He saw this, and told me several times that he was\r\nabout to renounce them; but vanity, which was the strongest of his\r\npassions, prevented him from telling me the truth, and he professed to\r\nentertain hopes which he had not, and which I knew that he could not\r\nhave. Some time passed in this way; and, finally, I had reason to\r\nbelieve that I could make a more considerable use than Miossens of the\r\nfriendship and confidence of Madame de Longueville. I made him believe\r\nit himself. He knew my position at Court; I told him my views, declaring\r\nthat my consideration for him would always restrain me, and that I would\r\nnot attempt to form a connection with Madame de Longueville without his\r\npermission. I will even confess that I irritated him against her in\r\norder to obtain it, without, however, saying anything untrue. He\r\ndelivered her over entirely to me, but he repented when he saw the\r\nresult of that connection.\"[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] Petitot Collection, vol. li. p. 393.\r\n\r\nWhen, subdued at length by the passion shown for her by La\r\nRochefoucauld, Madame de Longueville had determined to respond to it,\r\nshe gave herself up to him wholly--devoting herself in everything to the\r\nman whom she dared to love. She made it a point of honour, as doubtless\r\nit was a secret happiness, to share his destiny and to follow him\r\nwithout casting one backward glance--sacrificing to him all her private\r\ninterests, the evident interest of her family, and the strongest\r\nsentiment of her soul, her tenderness for her brother Conde.\r\n\r\nThe truthful Madame de Motteville, after noting the principal motive\r\nwhich urged La Rochefoucauld in his pursuit of Madame de Longueville,\r\nadds: \"In all that she has since done, it is clearly seen that ambition\r\nwas not the only thing that occupied her soul, and that the interests of\r\nthe Prince de Marsillac there held a prominent place. For him she became\r\nambitious, for him she ceased to love repose; and in order to show\r\nherself alive to this affection, she became too insensible to her own\r\nfame.... The declarations of the Prince de Marsillac, as I have already\r\nsaid, had not been displeasing to her; and this nobleman, who was\r\nperhaps more selfish than tender, wishing through her to promote his own\r\ninterests, believed that he should inspire her with a desire of ruling\r\nthe princes her brothers.\"[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] Mad. de Motteville, vol. ii. p. 17.\r\n\r\nSuch being the sordid motives of her wooer, the oft-repeated lines,\r\ntherefore, which he wrote with his own hand behind a portrait of the\r\nDuchess must be construed with a considerable abatement of their poetic\r\nardour:--\r\n\r\n  \"Pour meriter son coeur, pour plaire a ses beaux yeux,\r\n  J'ai fait la guerre aux rois, Je l'aurais faite aux dieux.\"[4]\r\n\r\n    [4] At a later period, after he had lost his sight from a\r\n    pistol-shot received at the combat of the Porte St. Antoine during\r\n    the Fronde, and had quarrelled with the Duchess, he parodied his own\r\n    distich,--\r\n\r\n      \"Pour ce coeur inconstant, qu'enfin Je connais mieux,\r\n      J'ai fait la guerre au roi; J'en ai perdu les yeux.\"\r\n\r\nSuch a dissembler then was the coldly ambitious, egotistical, clever\r\nDuke de la Rochefoucauld--a man capable of sacrificing everybody to his\r\nown interests. Madame de Longueville, such as we have depicted her,\r\ncould not help being the instrument of a man of like character. M.\r\nCousin seems to have arrived at that conclusion, since, in designating\r\nthat princess as _the soul of the Fronde_, he acknowledges \"that she\r\ntroubled the state and her own family by an extravagant passion for one\r\nof the chiefs of the _Importants_, become one of the chiefs of the\r\nFronde.\" But M. Cousin is very nearly silent touching the Prince de\r\nConti, of whom the Duchess was the sole motive-power on all occasions,\r\nand he merely says that this young prince submitted to be led by his\r\nsister in order to stand upon an equal footing with his elder brother\r\nwhilst waiting for a cardinal's hat.\r\n\r\nArmand de Bourbon, Prince de Conti, born in 1629, was eighteen years of\r\nage in 1647. He had good intellect and a not unpleasant countenance; but\r\na slight deformity and a certain feebleness of constitution rendering\r\nhim unfit for the army, he was early destined for the church. He had\r\nstudied among the Jesuits at the college of Clermont with Moliere, and\r\nhis father had obtained for him the richest benefices, and demanded a\r\ncardinal's hat. While waiting for this hat dignity, Armand de Bourbon\r\nwas living at the Hotel de Conde, partly an ecclesiastic, partly a man\r\nof the world, passing his days with wits and men of fashion, and greedy\r\nof every species of success. The glory of his brother filled him with\r\nemulation, and he dreamed himself of warlike exploits. When his sister\r\nreturned from Germany, he went to meet her, and, dazzled by her beauty,\r\nher grace, and her fame, he began to love her rather as a gallant than\r\nas a brother. He followed her blindly in all her adventures, in which\r\nhe exhibited as much courage as volatility. When he had made his peace\r\nwith the Court--thanks to his marriage with a niece of Mazarin, the\r\nbeautiful and virtuous Anne-Marie Martinozzi--he obtained the\r\ncommand-in-chiefship of the army of Catalonia, in which capacity he\r\nacquitted himself with great honour. He was much less successful in\r\nItaly. On the whole, he was far from injuring his name, and he gave to\r\nFrance, in the person of his young son, a true warrior, one of the best\r\npupils of Conde, one of the last eminent generals of the seventeenth\r\ncentury. Constrained, through ill-health, to betake himself again to\r\nreligion, the Prince de Conti finished, where he had begun, with\r\ntheology. He composed several meritorious and learned works on various\r\nreligious subjects.\r\n\r\nIn 1647, he was entirely devoted to vanity and pleasure. He adored his\r\nsister, and she exercised over him a somewhat ridiculous empire, which\r\ncontinued during several years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  THE DUCHESS DE CHEVREUSE DRIVEN INTO EXILE FOR THE THIRD TIME.\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN in the summer of 1644, the Queen of England, the fugitive consort\r\nof Charles I., sought an asylum in France from the fury of the English\r\nparliamentarians, and went to drink the Bourbon waters, Madame de\r\nChevreuse eagerly desired to see once more that illustrious princess,\r\nwho had so warmly welcomed her when herself an exile, at the Court of\r\nSt. James's. Queen Henrietta, too, who like her mother, Marie de'\r\nMedici, as well as the Duchess, was of the Spanish and Catholic party,\r\nwould have been delighted to have mingled her tears with those of so old\r\nand faithful a friend. But the royal exile did not deem it right to give\r\nway to her inclination without Queen Anne's permission, who at that\r\nmoment was according her such noble hospitality. Anne of Austria\r\npolitely replied that the Queen, her sister, was perfectly free to act\r\nas she chose; but it was intimated to her, through the Chevalier de\r\nJars, that it was inexpedient to receive the visit of a person who,\r\nthrough misguided conduct, had forfeited Her Majesty's favour. This\r\nfresh disgrace, added to so many others, increased the Duchess's\r\nirritation to the highest pitch. She redoubled her efforts to break the\r\nyoke that oppressed her. Mazarin watched and was made acquainted with\r\nall her manoeuvres. He had the comptroller of her household arrested\r\nin Paris, and shortly afterwards even her physician, whilst accompanying\r\nMadame de Chevreuse's daughter in her carriage for an airing. The\r\nDuchess complained bitterly of this latter proceeding in a letter which\r\nshe contrived to have handed to the Queen. She asserted that\r\nMademoiselle de Chevreuse was forced to quit the vehicle, two archers\r\nlevelling their pistols at her breast, and shouting all the\r\nwhile--\"Fire! fire!\" and they threatened, after the same fashion, the\r\nfemale attendants who were with her. At the same time that she protested\r\nher own innocence, she did not fail to challenge Anne's sense of\r\njustice, with a view to neutralize the enmity of Mazarin. But the\r\nphysician whom he had had arrested, on being flung into the Bastile,\r\nmade avowals which opened up traces of very grave matters; and an exempt\r\nof the King's guards was despatched to Madame de Chevreuse with an order\r\ncommanding her to retire to Angouleme, and the officer was even charged\r\nto convey her thither. At Angouleme was that strong fortress used as a\r\nstate prison, in which her friend Chateauneuf had been confined on her\r\naccount for ten long years. This reminiscence, ever present to the\r\nDuchess's imagination, terrified her sorely. She dreaded lest it should\r\nbe the same sort of _retreat_ which they now intended for her; and the\r\nactive-minded woman, preferring every kind of extremity to being\r\nimprisoned, decided upon renewing the career of a wanderer and an\r\nadventurer, as in 1637, and to tread for the third time the wearisome\r\npaths of exile.\r\n\r\nBut how greatly were circumstances then changed around her, and how\r\nchanged was she also herself! Her first exile from France in 1626, had\r\nproved one continuous triumph. Young, lovely, and adored by every one,\r\nshe had quitted Nancy, leaving the Duke de Lorraine a slave\r\nhenceforward to the sway of her charms, only to return to Paris and\r\ntrouble the mind of the stony, impassive Richelieu. In 1637 her flight\r\ninto Spain had, on the contrary, proved a most severe trial to her. She\r\nhad been forced to traverse the whole of France disguised in male\r\nattire, brave more than one danger, endure much suffering and privation,\r\nonly to struggle in the sequel with five consecutive years of fruitless\r\nagitation. But, at any rate, she then had youth to back her, and the\r\nconsciousness of the power of that irresistible fascination which\r\nprocured her adorers and suitors wherever she wandered, even among the\r\noccupants of thrones. She had faith likewise in the Queen's friendship,\r\nand a firm reliance that the time would come when that friendship would\r\nrepay her for all her devotedness. But now age she felt was creeping\r\nupon her; her beauty, verging towards its decline, promised her\r\nhenceforward conquests only few and far between. She perceived that in\r\nlosing her power over Anne of Austria's heart, she had lost the greater\r\nportion of her prestige both in France and Europe. The flight of the\r\nDuke de Vendome, shortly about to be followed by that of the Duke de\r\nBouillon, left the _Importants_ without any chief of note. The Duchess\r\nhad found Mazarin to be quite as skilful and formidable an enemy as\r\nRichelieu. Victory seemed to have entered into a compact with him. De\r\nBouillon's own brother, Turenne, solicited the honour of serving him,\r\nand the young Duke d'Enghien won battle after battle for him. She knew\r\nalso that the Cardinal had that in his hands wherewith he could condemn\r\nand sentence her to incarceration for the rest of her days. When,\r\nhowever, almost every one forsook her, this extraordinary woman did not\r\ngive way to self-abandonment. As soon as the exempt Riquetti had\r\nsignified to her the order of which he was the bearer, she adopted\r\nmeasures with her accustomed promptitude, and, accompanied by her\r\ndaughter Charlotte, who had hastened to her mother and refused to quit\r\nher, she succeeded in reaching by cross-roads the thickets of La Vendee\r\nand the solitudes of Brittany; until, approaching within a few leagues\r\nof St.-Malo, she solicited an asylum at the hands of the Marquis de\r\nCoetquen. That noble and generous Breton gave her the hospitality which\r\nwas due to such a woman struggling against such adversity. Marie de\r\nRohan did not abuse it; and after placing her jewels in his hands for\r\nsafety, as she had formerly done in those of La Rochefoucauld,[1] she\r\nembarked with her daughter in the depth of winter at St.-Malo, on board\r\na small vessel bound for Dartmouth, whence she purposed crossing over to\r\nDunkirk and entering Flanders. But the English parliamentarian\r\nmen-of-war were cruising in the Channel. They fell in with and captured\r\nthe wretched little bark, and carried her into the Isle of Wight. There\r\nMadame de Chevreuse was recognised; and as she was known to be a friend\r\nof the Queen of England, the Roundheads were not loth to subject her to\r\nsufficiently rough treatment; and afterwards hand her over to Mazarin.\r\nFortunately, in the Governor of the Isle of Wight, she met with the\r\nEarl of Pembroke, whom she had formerly known. The Duchess appealed to\r\nhis courtesy,[2] and thanks to his good offices, she obtained--but with\r\nno little difficulty--passports which permitted her to gain Dunkirk, and\r\nthence the Spanish Low Countries.\r\n\r\n    [1] Subsequently, she requested the Marquis de Coetquen to hand over\r\n    her jewels to Montresor, who transferred them to a messenger of the\r\n    Duchess. But Mazarin was informed of everything from first to last.\r\n    He was aware of every tittle of the Duchess's correspondence, and\r\n    tried to seize with the strong hand the famous gems which had\r\n    formerly belonged to Marie de' Medicis' favourite foster-sister,\r\n    Leonora Galligai, created Marchioness d'Ancre. On the murder of the\r\n    Marshal d'Ancre, these diamonds and _parures_, valued at two hundred\r\n    thousand crowns, with a vast amount of other property confiscated by\r\n    an edict of Louis XIII., were bestowed by the king on his lucky\r\n    favourite, De Luynes, the first husband of Marie de Rohan. Failing\r\n    in his attempt to possess himself of these costly gems, Mazarin\r\n    arrested Montresor, and kept him upwards of a year in prison. See\r\n    \"Memoirs of Montresor.\"\r\n\r\n    [2] See her letter to the Earl of Pembroke, dated Isle of Wight,\r\n    29th April, 1645, in \"Archives des Affaires Etrangeres, France,\" t.\r\n    cvi. p. 162.\r\n\r\nThe adventurous exile took up her abode for a short time at Liege, and\r\napplied herself to maintain and consolidate to the utmost degree\r\npossible between Spain, Austria, and the Duke de Lorraine, an alliance,\r\nwhich was the final resource of the _Importants_, and the last basis of\r\nher own political reputation and high standing. Mazarin, however, having\r\ngot the upper hand, resumed all Richelieu's designs, and, like him, made\r\nstrenuous efforts to detach Lorraine from his two allies. The gay Duke\r\nwas then madly enamoured of the fair Beatrice de Cusance, Princess of\r\nCantecroix. Mazarin laboured to gain over the lady, and he proposed to\r\nthe ambitious and enterprising Charles IV. to break with Spain and march\r\ninto Franche-Comte with the aid of France, promising to leave him in\r\npossession of all he might conquer. The Cardinal succeeded in winning\r\nover to his interest Duke Charles's own sister (the former mistress of\r\nPuylaurens), the Princess de Phalzbourg, then greatly fallen from her\r\nformer \"high estate,\" and who gave him secret and faithful account of\r\nall that passed in her brother's immediate circle. Mazarin required of\r\nher especially to keep him apprised of Madame de Chevreuse's slightest\r\nmovement. He knew that she was in correspondence with the Duke de\r\nBouillon, that she disposed of the Imperial general Piccolomini by means\r\nof her friend Madame de' Strozzi, and even that she had preserved\r\nintact her sway over the Duke de Lorraine, in spite of the charms of the\r\nfair Beatrice. By the help of the Princess de Phalzbourg he watched\r\nevery step, and disputed with her, foot to foot, possession of the\r\nfickle Charles IV., sometimes the victor, but very often the vanquished\r\nin this mysterious struggle.\r\n\r\nThe advantage remained with Madame de Chevreuse. Her ascendancy over\r\nCharles IV.--the offspring of love, surviving that passion, but more\r\npotent than all the later loves of that inconstant Prince--retained him\r\nin alliance with Spain, and frustrated Mazarin's projects. By degrees\r\nshe became once more the soul of every intrigue planned against the\r\nFrench Government. She did not always attack it from without, but\r\nfostered internal difficulties, which, like the heads of the hydra, were\r\nunceasingly springing forth. Surrounded by a knot of ardent and\r\nobstinate emigrants, among others by the Count de Saint-Ybar, one of the\r\nmost resolute men of the party, she kept up the spirits of the remnant\r\nof the _Importants_ left in France, and everywhere added fuel to the\r\nfire of sedition. Actuated by strong passion, yet mistress of herself,\r\nshe preserved a calm brow amidst the wrack of the tempest, at the same\r\ntime that she displayed an indefatigable activity in surprising the\r\nenemy on his weak side. Making use alike of the Catholic and the\r\nProtestant party, at times she meditated a revolt in Languedoc, or a\r\ndescent upon Brittany; at others, on the slightest symptom of discontent\r\nbetrayed by some person of importance, she laboured to drive out\r\nMazarin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  FATAL INFLUENCE OF MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE'S PASSION FOR LA\r\n  ROCHEFOUCAULD.--THE FRONDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE do not propose to enter into the labyrinth of intrigues which\r\npreceded the outbreak of the Fronde, but confine ourselves to an\r\nendeavour to trace the motives which led Madame de Longueville to throw\r\nherself into the centre of the malcontents and to figure as the chief\r\nheroine in the varied scenes of that tragi-comedy of civil war.\r\n\r\nThe first Fronde was formed out of the _debris_ of the _Importants_. It\r\nwas composed of all the malcontents who made common cause with those\r\nmembers of the parliament who were irritated by the frequent bursal\r\nedicts, notably that which, in 1648, created twelve new appointments of\r\n_maitres de requetes_.\r\n\r\nAnd now what gave birth to the Fronde, or what sustained it? What roused\r\nup the old party of the _Importants_, stifled for some years, it would\r\nseem, under the laurels of Rocroy? What separated the princes of the\r\nblood from the Crown? What turned against the throne that illustrious\r\nhouse of Conde, which, until then, had been its sword and shield? There\r\nwere doubtless many general causes for all this; but it is impossible\r\nfor us to conceal one--private, it is true, but which exercised a\r\npowerful and deplorable influence--the unexpected love of Madame de\r\nLongueville for one of the chiefs of the _Importants_, who had become\r\none of the chiefs of the Fronde. Yes--sad to say--it was Madame de\r\nLongueville, who, joining the party of the malcontents, attracted\r\nthereto, at first, a part of her family, then her entire family, and\r\nthus precipitated it from the pinnacle of honour and glory to which so\r\nmany services had elevated it.\r\n\r\nScarcely had the treaty of Muenster suspended the scourge of foreign war\r\nfor France, than internal dissensions began to trouble the realm. The\r\nhatred which the Parliament bore to Mazarin, through his repression of\r\nits functions, primarily gave birth to civil war. The Duchess de\r\nLongueville became in the faction of the Fronde what the Duchess de\r\nMontpensier had been in that of the League. The former, however, did not\r\nat first attach so great an importance to the cause she espoused.\r\nCharacteristically careless, she was by nature little inclined to\r\nagitation and intrigue. We have already shown that before her _liaison_\r\nwith La Rochefoucauld, Madame de Longueville had been a stranger to\r\npolitics. Occupied solely with innocent gallantry and the homage of the\r\nmost refined society of the day, she allowed herself in all else to be\r\nled by her father and her elder brother. But no sooner was La\r\nRochefoucauld master of her heart, than she gave herself wholly up to\r\nhim, and became a mere instrument in his hands. Having been by him\r\ninspired with ambition, she made it a point of honour, and doubtless a\r\nsecret happiness, to share his destiny.\r\n\r\nIt seems not improbable that the Duchess might have caught a liking for\r\npolitics and negotiation during the conference of Munster. Certain it is\r\nthat once plunged into the eddying tide of the Fronde, she loftily\r\nannounced the project of remedying the general disorder of affairs. But\r\nshe especially desired to employ therein the means which confer\r\ncelebrity, and it is difficult to deny that ambition, although without\r\ndeterminate aim, and the desire of establishing a high opinion of her\r\nintellect, may have had some share in the reasons which induced her to\r\nembrace the party opposed to Mazarin. With herself she drew her husband\r\ninto it, as well as the Prince de Conti, her younger brother. As for the\r\nelder, the victorious Conde, he at first declared for the King and the\r\nQueen-Regent, which greatly incensed his sister against him, and caused\r\nher to enter into close compact, amongst others, with the Coadjutor,\r\nafterwards Cardinal de Retz--that mischievous man who figured so\r\nconspicuously as the evil genius of the Fronde.\r\n\r\nThe Gondis, who were the chief advisers of the St. Bartholomew, owed to\r\nthat terrible exploit the result of being very nearly the hereditary\r\npossessors of the Archbishopric of Paris. But this last Gondi--John\r\nFrancis Paul--owed something more: to be at the same time governor of\r\nParis, and to unite both powers. With such purpose, he artfully worked\r\nupon the city through the curates who, distributing bread, soup, and\r\nevery other kind of alms, carried along with them the famished masses.\r\nThis young ecclesiastic of the de Retz family had risen into great\r\nfavour with the serious and religious sections of the Parisian\r\ncommunity. He was nephew of the Archbishop of Paris, and was himself\r\nArchbishop of Corinth; but as his flock in that metropolitan city were\r\nschismatic (except those who had turned Turks), he had leisure to assist\r\nhis uncle in his high office, and was appointed his Coadjutor and\r\nsuccessor. He preached at all the churches, held visitations at the\r\nconvents, catechised the young, and consulted with the senior clergy on\r\nthe management of the diocese. When he rode through the streets he was\r\nsaluted with cheers and blessings, and the orators of the Fronde held\r\nhim up as the pattern of all the Christian virtues. At night he put off\r\nhis episcopal robes, disguised himself as a trooper or tradesman, and\r\nattended the meetings of the discontented. In a short time he had\r\ndistributed seven or eight thousand pounds in stirring up the passions\r\nof the people, and was daily in expectation of being summoned by his\r\npatroness the Queen to exert his influence in quelling them. The\r\npopulace, with an Archbishop-governor of Paris at their head, imagined\r\nthat they were going to rule there as in the time of the League. This\r\nmade them both blind and deaf to the morals and manners of the little\r\nprelate. A braggart, a duellist, and more than a gallant--though having\r\nswarthy, ugly features, turned-up nose, and short, bandy legs--yet his\r\nexpressive eyes carried off every fault, sparkling as they were with\r\nintelligence, audacity, and libertinage. Few withstood this subtle\r\nknave, for he was wont to waive all ceremonial and spare everybody\r\nprefatory speeches. The ladies of gallantry--especially those whose\r\nlover he was--were his most indefatigable political agents. The Queen,\r\nat length, suspecting that the worthy Archbishop was not quite the\r\nsimple and self-denying individual he appeared, had him watched and\r\nfollowed. Whilst he flattered himself with the anticipation that his\r\nassistance would be solicited at the Palais Royal, the Queen was making\r\na jest of him, and Mazarin determined to strike the blow.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August, 1648, a vast assemblage crowded the spacious\r\nprecincts of Notre Dame, to celebrate a _Te Deum_ for the great victory\r\nof Lens, of which the youthful Conde had just sent home the news. When\r\nthe multitude were dispersing, a dash was made upon two or three of the\r\nobnoxious councillors who had inflamed the discussions of the\r\nFronde--for that civil war was fairly on foot ere Anne of Austria and\r\nMazarin knew of its existence. Two of the intended prisoners escaped,\r\nbut a surly, burly demagogue, named Broussel, was tracked to his house\r\nin the mechanics' quarter of Paris, and arrested by an armed force.\r\nThereupon the populace rose and armed against the Court. They made an\r\nextraordinary stand in the streets, having raised _twelve hundred_\r\nbarricades in the course of twelve hours. They had no further need of De\r\nRetz. It was, however, one of his mistresses, the sister of a president\r\nand wife of a city captain, who having in her house the drum belonging\r\nto the citizen guard of that quarter, gave the first impulse by causing\r\nit to be beaten. The train was thus fired and the flame of civil war\r\nkindled. This was called the _Day of the Barricades_.\r\n\r\nThus, the royal power which, as wielded by Richelieu, had come to\r\nbe considered as absolute, was attacked by three parties\r\nsimultaneously--the great nobles, the parliamentarians, and the\r\n_bourgeoisie_; but, notwithstanding the dread of the common enemy, which\r\nunited them, those parties were of different origin and conditions of\r\nexistence, and consequently had different interests also. The great\r\nnobles wished to exercise power by placing themselves above the law; the\r\nparliament to increase its own through the law; the citizens to\r\nestablish theirs at the expense of the law: for in their eyes the law\r\nwas full of abuses and the royal power cruelly oppressive. All three\r\nparties, in order to arrive at their several ends, had, therefore,\r\nrecourse to violence, or derived aid from it.\r\n\r\nOn the return of Madame de Longueville from Muenster, there was already a\r\nferment in the minds of the Parisians, of which the Regent took little\r\nheed. The Fronde cabal was then brooding in the dark. When the\r\nrebellion, formed by Gondi, broke out at last under the circumstances\r\njust narrated, Madame de Longueville, alone of all the princesses of the\r\nblood, did not accompany Anne of Austria in her flight to Rueil. The\r\nDuchess strove her utmost to strengthen, by the concurrence of her\r\nentire family, the faction whose fortunes she had embraced through\r\ndevotion to Marsillac. She did not, however, then succeed in detaching\r\nConde from the Regent's party. The battle of the barricades followed\r\nclose upon that of Lens, Conde's last victory. On his return, that\r\nvictorious young soldier found royalty humiliated, the Parliament\r\ntriumphing and dictating laws to the Crown; the Duke de Beaufort, with\r\nwhom he once thought of measuring swords in defence of the honour of his\r\nsister, freed from his prison in Vincennes, and master of Paris by aid\r\nof the populace who idolized him; the vain and fickle Abbe de Retz\r\ntransformed into a tribune of the people; the Prince de Conti into a\r\ngeneralissimo; M. de Longueville under the guidance of his wife and La\r\nRochefoucauld; and the feeble Duke d'Orleans fancying himself almost a\r\nKing, because he saw the Queen humiliated, and because the Frondeurs,\r\ncunningly flattering his self-love, were treating him like a sovereign.\r\nConde, at a glance, saw the situation of affairs and his duty also; and\r\nwithout any hesitation he offered his sword to the Queen.\r\n\r\nBrother and sister were, therefore, about to be arrayed against each\r\nother in the strife of civil war, and a stormy explanation took place\r\nbetween them. It is asserted that for some time back their reciprocal\r\ntenderness had suffered more than one interruption; that, in 1645,\r\nMadame de Longueville had crossed the loves of her brother and\r\nMademoiselle du Vigean; that, in 1646, Conde, seeing her too intimate\r\nwith La Rochefoucauld, had caused her to be summoned to Muenster by her\r\nhusband. But for this we have only the authority of the Duchess de\r\nNemours, her step-daughter and unsparing censor, and nothing is less\r\nprobable. The passion of Conde for Mademoiselle de Vigean extinguished\r\nitself, as all contemporaries affirm. The attentions of La Rochefoucauld\r\nto Madame de Longueville may have preceded the embassy of Muenster, but\r\nthey were not observed until 1647, and it is at the close of this year\r\nthat Madame de Motteville places them, while attributing them especially\r\nto the desire of La Rochefoucauld to share the confidence of the sister\r\nwith the brother. But it is very certain that as soon as the latter\r\nremarked this connection, he disapproved of it entirely; and not\r\nsucceeding in his effort to rouse his sister from the intoxication of a\r\nfirst passion, he passed from the most ardent affection to a bitter\r\ndiscontent. In the autumn of 1648, on his return from Lens, this\r\nconnection had acquired its greatest strength, and become almost\r\nnotorious. Madame de Longueville, directed by La Rochefoucauld, did then\r\neverything possible to gain over her brother. She brought all her\r\nallurements to bear upon him, all her fondlings. She put into play\r\neverything which she thought might influence his fickle and passionate\r\ndisposition--but failed. Neither did he succeed in gaining over her his\r\naccustomed ascendency. They quarrelled and separated openly. Madame de\r\nLongueville plunged more deeply into the Fronde, and Conde applied\r\nhimself to giving the new _Importants_ a harsh lesson.\r\n\r\nThe Queen had retired to Saint-Germain with the young King and all the\r\ngovernment. Paris was under the absolute control of the Fronde. It\r\nstirred up the Parliament by the aid of a few ambitious councillors and\r\nby seditious and mischievous inquests. It disposed of a great part of\r\nthe Parisian clergy through the Coadjutor of the Archbishop De Retz, who\r\npossessed and exercised all the authority of his uncle. It had\r\ncontinually at its head the two great houses of Vendome and Lorraine,\r\nwith two princes of the blood, the Prince de Conti and the Duke de\r\nLongueville, followed by a very great number of illustrious families,\r\nincluding the Dukes d'Elbeuf, de Bouillon, and de Beaufort, and other\r\npowerful nobles. It gave law in the _salons_, thanks to a brilliant bevy\r\nof pretty women, who drew after them the flower of the young nobility.\r\nIn short, the army itself was divided. Turenne, with his troops, who\r\nwere stationed near the Rhine until the perfect conclusion of the treaty\r\nof Westphalia, obedient to the suggestions of his elder brother, the\r\nDuke de Bouillon, who wished to recover his principality of Sedan, had\r\njust raised the standard of revolt, and was threatening to place the\r\nCourt between his own army and that of Paris. The parliament of the\r\ncapital had sent deputies to all the parliaments of the kingdom, and was\r\nthus forming a sort of formidable parliamentary league in the face of\r\nmonarchy. Conde took command of all the troops that remained faithful,\r\nand everywhere opposed the insurrection. He wrote himself to the army of\r\nthe Rhine, which well knew him, and which after the rout sustained by\r\nTurenne at Mariendal, had been led back by him to victory: these\r\nletters, supported by the proceedings of the government, succeeded in\r\narresting the revolt; and Turenne, abandoned by his own soldiers, was\r\nobliged to fly to Holland.[1] At ease on this head, Conde marched upon\r\nParis, and placed it under siege. Instead of disputing the ground, as\r\nhe might have done, foot by foot, with the sedition, he allowed it the\r\nfreest course, in the certainty that the spectacle of licentiousness\r\nwhich could not fail to appear would, little by little, restore to\r\nroyalty those who had for a moment gone astray. He began by summoning,\r\nin the Queen's name and through his mother, all his family to\r\nSaint-Germain. The Prince de Conti and M. de Longueville did not dare\r\ndisobey; but La Rochefoucauld, seeing that the Fronde was in the\r\ngreatest peril, hastened after these two princes. Having brought them\r\nback to Paris, he made the Prince de Conti generalissimo--placing under\r\nhim the Dukes d'Elbeuf and de Bouillon--and who shared authority with\r\nthe Marshal de la Mothe Houdancourt, governor of Paris. Madame de\r\nLongueville excused herself to the Queen and to her mother on the\r\ngrounds of her delicate condition, which would not permit her to\r\nundertake the least fatigue. In fact, Madame de Longueville, it may be\r\nnoted, was _enceinte_ for the last time in 1648, when, it must be\r\nconfessed, her connection with La Rochefoucauld was well known. It was\r\nin this condition that, willing to share the perils of her friends,\r\nproud also of playing a part and of filling all the trumpets of fame,\r\nshe enacted Pallas as well as she was able. It is at least certain that\r\nshe shared all the fatigues of the siege, that she was present at the\r\nreviews of the troops, at the parades of the citizen soldiery, and that\r\nall the civil and military plans were discussed before her. In this\r\ndisorder and confusion, amidst the tumult of arms and vociferations of\r\nthe insurrection, she appeared as if in her natural element. She\r\nencouraged, counselled, acted, and the most energetic resolutions\r\nemanated from her. The memoirs of the times are full, in regard to this,\r\nof the most curious details. The Hotel de Longueville was continually\r\nfilled with officers and generals; nothing was seen there but plumes,\r\nhelmets, and swords.\r\n\r\n    [1] \"History of Turenne,\" by Ramsay, vol. ii.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all this, the democratic spirit which had originated the\r\nFronde was not satisfied. It beheld with displeasure all the forces of\r\nParis in the hands of the brother, of the brother-in-law, and of the\r\nsister of him who commanded the siege. Believing very little, and with\r\nreason, in the patriotism of the princes, the citizens demanded some\r\nsureties from the chiefs who might at any time betray them, and make\r\npeace, at their expense, with Saint-Germain. No one seemed to know how\r\nto appease this clamorous multitude, without which nothing further could\r\nbe done. It was then that Madame de Longueville showed that, if she had\r\nforgotten her true duties, she had retained the energy of her race and\r\nthe intrepidity of the Condes. Under the advice of De Retz, she induced\r\nher husband to present himself to the Parliament and inform them that he\r\nhad come to offer his services, as well as the towns of Rouen, Caen,\r\nDieppe, and the whole of Normandy, of which he was governor; and he\r\nbegged the Parliament to consent that his wife and two children should\r\nbe lodged at the Hotel de Ville as a guarantee for the execution of his\r\nword. His speech was received with acclamations; and while the\r\ndeliberations were still going on, De Retz proceeded to seek the Duchess\r\nde Longueville and the Duchess de Bouillon, both prepared to act a part\r\nin the scene he proposed to display. He had already caused the proposal\r\nof the Duke de Longueville to be spread amongst the populace; and\r\nhurrying the two princesses into a carriage, dressed with studied and\r\nartful negligence, but surrounded by a splendid suite, and followed by\r\nan immense crowd to the principal quarter of the insurrection--the Hotel\r\nde Ville--those lovely and interesting women were placed in the hands\r\nof the people as hostages with all that was most dear to them.\r\n\"Imagine,\" says De Retz, \"these two beautiful persons upon the balcony\r\nof the Hotel de Ville; more beautiful because they appeared neglected,\r\nalthough they were not. Each held in her arms one of her children, who\r\nwere as beautiful as their mothers.\" La Greve was full of people, even\r\nto the house tops; the men all raised cries of joy, and the women wept\r\nwith emotion. De Retz, meanwhile, threw handfuls of money from the\r\nwindows of the Hotel de Ville amongst the populace, and then, leaving\r\nthe princesses under the protection of the city, he returned to the\r\nPalais de Justice, followed by an immense multitude, whose acclamations\r\nrent the skies.\r\n\r\nOn the night of the 28th of January, 1649, Madame de Longueville gave\r\nbirth to her last child, a son, who was baptized by De Retz, having for\r\nits godfather the Provost, for its godmother the Duchess de Bouillon,\r\nand who received the name of Charles de Paris; the child of the Fronde,\r\nhandsome, talented, and brave; who during his life was the troublesome\r\nhope, the melancholy joy of his mother, and the cause of her greatest\r\ngrief in 1672, when he perished, at the passage of the Rhine, by the\r\nside of his uncle, Conde.\r\n\r\nThe Prince de Conti being declared _generalissimo of the army of the\r\nKing, under the parliament_, and the Dukes de Bouillon and Elbeuf, with\r\nthe Marshal de la Mothe, generals under him, De Retz saw the full\r\nfruition of his intrigues. A civil war was now inevitable. The great and\r\nthe little, the wise and the foolish, the rash and the prudent, the\r\ncowardly and the brave, were all engaged and jumbled up pell-mell on\r\nboth sides; and the mixture was so strange, so heterogeneous, and so\r\nincomprehensible, that a sentiment of the ridiculous was irresistibly\r\nparamount, and the war began amongst fits of laughter on all sides. That\r\nsame day Conde's cavaliers came galloping into the faubourgs to fire\r\ntheir pistols at the Parisians, whilst the Marquis de Noirmoutier went\r\nforth with the cavalry of the Fronde to skirmish with them, and\r\nreturning to the Hotel de Ville, entered the circle of the Duchess de\r\nLongueville, followed by his officers, each wearing his cuirass, as he\r\ncame from the field. The hall was filled with ladies preparing to dance,\r\nthe troops were drawn up in the square, and this mixture of blue scarves\r\nand ladies, cuirasses and violins and trumpets, formed, says De Retz, a\r\nspectacle much more common in romances than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThe serio-grotesque drama of the Fronde was thus initiated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE WINS HER BROTHER CONDE OVER TO THE FRONDE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIS first raising of bucklers by the Frondeurs was not of long\r\nduration. At the conclusion of a peace between Mazarin and the\r\nParliament, a perfect understanding prevailed amongst all the members of\r\nthe Conde family. The civil dissensions, however, were sufficiently\r\nprolonged to exhibit the errors of all parties--even those who had\r\nentered therein with virtuous inclinations and intentions, ashamed of\r\nthe stains which had tarnished them in the struggle, almost invariably\r\nended by confining themselves to the narrow circle of individual\r\ninterests, and completed their degradation by no longer recognizing any\r\nother motive for their conduct than that of sordid selfishness. All care\r\nfor the public weal became extinct; men's hearts were insensible to all\r\ngenerous sympathy; their minds dead to every elevating impulse--like to\r\nthose aromatics which, after diffusing both glow and perfume from their\r\nardent brazier, lose by combustion all power of further rekindling, and\r\npresent nothing else than vile ashes, without heat, light, or odour.\r\n\r\nThe peace concluded between the Minister and the Fronde was destined to\r\nbe of short duration. It was, properly speaking, nothing but a\r\nsuspension of arms, and in no degree a suspension of intrigues and\r\ncabals. That suspension of arms, however, had been accompanied by an\r\namnesty, including all persons except the Coadjutor. The other chief\r\npersonages who had played a part in the insurrection of Paris, and who\r\nnow proceeded to visit the Court, were by no means warmly received by\r\nthe Queen, though Mazarin himself displayed nothing but mildness and\r\nhumility. The Duke d'Orleans and the Prince de Conde visited the city;\r\nand the first was received with much enthusiasm by the populace, who\r\nattributed to his counsels the truce of which all parties had stood so\r\nmuch in need. The Prince de Conde, whose warlike spirit had not only\r\naided in stirring up the strife at first, but would have protracted it\r\nstill further had his advice been listened to, was not looked upon with\r\nthe same favour by the Parisians; but the Parliament sent deputations to\r\nthem both on their arrival in the city, to compliment them on their\r\nefforts for the restoration of peace.\r\n\r\nDuring Conde's visit to Paris, a reconciliation took place between him\r\nand his fair sister, the Duchess de Longueville. The violent language he\r\nhad used to her on various occasions, the imputations he had cast upon\r\nher character, and the harsh nature of the advice which he had given to\r\nher husband concerning her, were all forgotten, and she resumed her\r\nascendancy over his mind so completely as in a very short time to detach\r\nhim entirely from the side of Mazarin, and to lead him, before he\r\nquitted Paris, to speak publicly of the Minister in the scornful and\r\ncontemptuous manner in which he was usually treated by the leaders of\r\nthe Fronde.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess de Longueville herself remained as strongly opposed to the\r\nCardinal as ever. But though she still retained towards Anne of Austria\r\nthat dislike which she had always felt, and which the sense of an\r\ninferiority of station greatly augmented in a woman of a haughty and\r\nambitious character, she found herself obliged, in common propriety, to\r\nappear at Court on the conclusion of the Siege of Paris. The first\r\nvisits of her husband and herself, after the insurrection, were rendered\r\nremarkable by the extraordinary degree of embarrassment and timidity\r\nshown by two such bold and fearless persons. The Duke de Longueville\r\narrived first, coming from Normandy; and was followed by a very numerous\r\nand splendid train, as though he rested for mental support upon the\r\nnumber of his retainers. The Queen received him in the midst of her\r\nCourt, with Mazarin standing beside her; and every one crowded round to\r\nhear what excuses the Duke would offer for abandoning the royal family\r\nat the moment of their greatest need. Longueville, however, approached\r\nthe Regent with a troubled and embarrassed air, attempted to speak,\r\nbecame first deadly pale, and then as red as fire, but could not utter a\r\nword. He then turned and bowed to Mazarin, who came forward, spoke to\r\nhim, and led him to a window, where they conversed for some time\r\ntogether in private; after which they visited each other frequently, and\r\nbecame apparent friends.\r\n\r\nThe reception of the proud and beautiful Duchess at St. Germain, though\r\nnot so public, was not less embarrassing. The Queen had lain down on her\r\nbed when the Duchess was announced, and, as was customary in those days,\r\nreceived her in that situation. Madame de Longueville was naturally very\r\napt to blush, and the frequent variation of her complexion added\r\ngreatly, we are told, to the dazzling character of her beauty. Her\r\nblushes, however, on approaching the Queen, became painful; all that she\r\ncould utter was a few confused sentences, of which the Queen could not\r\nunderstand a word, and those were pronounced in so low a tone that\r\nMadame de Motteville, who listened attentively, could distinguish\r\nnothing but the word _Madame_.\r\n\r\nAs there was no sincerity in these reconciliations, it is not surprising\r\nto find that ere long the conduct of the Prince de Conde gave no slight\r\nuneasiness to Mazarin. The Prince had, however, brought back the Court\r\nto Paris; but from that very day he had shown a great change in his\r\nattitude, and it is to the influence of La Rochefoucauld that such\r\nchange must be attributed. At that moment, in fact, the Sieur Conde had\r\nbecome reconciled with every member of his family, and even with his\r\nsister's lover. He drew closer also the links between himself and the\r\nDuke d'Orleans, for whom he shewed great deference, say his\r\ncontemporaries, and he began to treat Mazarin with much indifference,\r\nrallying him publicly, and declaring aloud that he regretted to have\r\nmaintained him in a post of which he was so little worthy. Enjoying a\r\ngreat military reputation, feared and esteemed by the bulk of his\r\ncountrymen, he chafed at seeing himself compromised by the unpopularity\r\nof the Cardinal. He thought that by drawing closer to the _Frondeurs_,\r\nhe should rid himself of the feeling that oppressed him. In the outset,\r\nhe had no idea of actively joining that faction, but his sister did the\r\nrest, and hurried him on to become the enemy of that party of which he\r\nhad just been the saviour.\r\n\r\nIt is true that, for the memorable service which he had recently\r\nrendered, Conde reaped scarcely any benefit; but his noble conduct\r\nincreased the splendour of his last campaign of 1648. It added to his\r\nmilitary titles those of defender and saviour of the throne, of\r\npacificator of the realm, of arbiter and enlightened conciliator of\r\nparties. It gave the climax to his credit and to his glory.\r\nNevertheless, he did not lose sight of the jealous feeling to which\r\nsuch claims gave birth, whether on the part of the Duke d'Orleans or the\r\nPrime Minister; and he well knew that he was exposed to one of those\r\n_coups d'etat_, the necessity of which the Chancellor as well as himself\r\nhad urged at Rueil. He considered himself as the head of the nobility,\r\nand that important body seemed to constitute all the military power of\r\nthe State. But the French nobility was just beginning to lose its former\r\nindependence of character in becoming more courtierlike. Instead of\r\nderiving from its strongholds and vassals the feeling of its strength\r\nand equality, it showed itself ambitious of such distinctions as the\r\nmonarch could confer. In the indulgence of its vanity it lost sight of\r\nits proper pride; and if that new emulation which the Bourbons had\r\nexcited was more easy for the sovereign to satisfy, it was more\r\ndifficult for the chief of a party to direct. Moreover, Conde, as the\r\nDuchess de Nemours remarks, knew better how to win battles than\r\nhearts.[1] He found a dangerous pleasure, as did his sister the Duchess\r\nde Longueville, in braving malevolence. \"In matters of consequence, they\r\ndelighted to thwart people, and in ordinary life they were so\r\nimpracticable that there was no getting on with them. They had such a\r\nhabit of ridiculing one, and of saying offensive things, that nobody\r\ncould put up with them. When visits were paid to them, they allowed such\r\na scornful ennui to be visible, and showed so openly that their visitors\r\nbored them, that it was not difficult to understand that they did\r\neverything in their power to get rid of their company. Whatsoever might\r\nbe the rank or quality of the visitors, people were made to wait any\r\nlength of time in the Prince's antechamber; and very often, after having\r\nlong waited, everybody was sent away without getting an interview,\r\nhowever short. When they were displeased they pushed people to the\r\nutmost extremity, and they were incapable of showing any gratitude for\r\nservices done them. Thus they were alike hated by the Court, by the\r\nFronde, and by the populace, and nobody could live with them long. All\r\nFrance impatiently suffered their irritating conduct, and especially\r\ntheir pride, which was excessive.\"[2]\r\n\r\n    [1] Duchesse de Nemours, tom., xxxiv. p. 437.\r\n\r\n    [2] The Duchess de Nemours was a daughter of the Duke de\r\n    Longueville, by his first wife, and as she lived with her\r\n    step-mother, the Duchess de Longueville, on very indifferent terms,\r\n    her unsparing censure must by no means be implicitly received.\r\n\r\nIn looking at the faulty side of Conde's character, we must not forget\r\nto observe the disinterested firmness with which, without considering\r\neither his family or his friends, he had hitherto acted in the interests\r\nof the King. Happy would it have been, if, after having thus terminated\r\nthis sad civil war, he had quitted the Court and its intrigues to seek\r\nother battlefields, and to finish another war somewhat more useful and\r\nglorious to France--that which still remained with Spain! Happy, also\r\nfor Madame de Longueville, if, taught by her own conscience, in her last\r\ninterview with the Queen, and by the shameful _denouement_ of the\r\nmiserable intrigues of which she had the secret, instead of still\r\nserving as their instrument, she had shown her courage in resisting\r\nthem. Happy too, if, after all the proofs of devotion which she had just\r\ngiven to La Rochefoucauld, she had firmly represented to him that, even\r\nfor his own interest, a different course was necessary; that it would be\r\nbetter to look for fortune and honours by rendering himself esteemed\r\nthan by trying to make himself feared; that ambition as well as duty\r\nshowed his place to be by the side of Conde, in the service of the\r\nState and of the King; that it was easy for him to obtain in the army\r\nsome post where he would simply have to march forward and do his duty,\r\ntrusting to his courage and his other merits!\r\n\r\nBut even if Anne de Bourbon had been wise enough to speak thus to La\r\nRochefoucauld, she would not have succeeded in gaining his ear. His\r\nrestless spirit, his ever-discontented vanity, pursuing by turns the\r\nmost dissimilar objects, because it selected none within its reach--that\r\n_undefinable something_ which, as De Retz says, was in La Rochefoucauld,\r\nmade him abandon the high and direct roads, and led him into by-paths\r\nfull of pitfalls and precipices. Through such perilous ways we shall see\r\nthe infatuated woman following and aiding him in his extravagant and\r\nguilty designs. Receiving the law instead of giving it, she strives to\r\npromote the passion of another by devoting to his service all her\r\ncoquetry as well as greatness of soul, her penetration and intrepidity,\r\nher attractive sweetness and indomitable energy. She undertakes to\r\nmislead Conde, to rob France of the conqueror of Rocroy and of Lens, and\r\nto give him to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  THE CAUSES WHICH LED TO THE _COUP D'ETAT_--THE ARREST OF THE PRINCES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the first scenes of the shifting drama, the Court had supported Conde\r\nin compassing the destruction of the Frondeurs; and Mazarin, with keen\r\npolicy, instigated the Prince to every act that could widen the breach\r\nbetween him and the faction. Whichever succeeded, the party that\r\nsuccumbed would be inimical to the Minister; and in their divisions was\r\nhis strength. But the pride and impetuosity of Conde were about this\r\ntime excited to such a degree by opposition and irritation, that it\r\napproached to frenzy, and, unable to overpower at once the leaders of\r\nthe Fronde, the vehemence of his nature spent itself upon those who were\r\nin reality supporting him. He still scoffed at, and openly insulted,\r\nMazarin; he accused the Government of not giving him sincere assistance\r\nagainst the Fronde. He every day made enemies amongst the nobility by\r\nhis overbearing conduct and his rash, and often illegal, acts; and at\r\nlength the disgust and indignation of the whole Court was roused to put\r\na stop to a tyranny which could no longer be borne.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria long hesitated as to what she should do to deliver\r\nherself from the domination of a man whom she feared without loving: but\r\nat length an aggravated insult to herself, and the counsels of a woman\r\nof a bold and daring character, removed her irresolution. The Duchess\r\nde Chevreuse had been exiled from France, as we have seen, during the\r\ngreater part of that period in which Conde had principally distinguished\r\nhimself, and she did not share in the awe in which the Parisians held\r\nhim. She still kept up what De Retz calls an incomprehensible union with\r\nthe Queen, notwithstanding all her intrigues; nor did she scruple to\r\nhold out to Anne of Austria a direct prospect of gaining the support of\r\nthe Fronde itself in favour of her Government, if that Government would\r\naid in avenging the Fronde upon the Prince de Conde.\r\n\r\nAnne of Austria was unwilling to take a step which appeared to border\r\nupon ingratitude, although the late conduct of the Prince might well be\r\nsupposed to cancel the obligation of his former services. It seems here\r\nnecessary to say a few words upon the connection of a series of sudden\r\npolitical changes, in order that the reader may understand how such\r\nstartling results as those we are about to narrate were brought about.\r\n\r\nThe hollow treaty of peace of the 11th March, 1649, had scarcely been\r\nsigned ere the Prince de Conde showed himself day by day more strongly\r\nattached to the faction which opposed the Court. Feeling his own\r\nimportance, determined to rule; quick, harsh, and impetuous in his\r\nmanners, he took a pleasure in insulting the Minister and embarrassing\r\nthe Queen. There were some personal grounds for this in the strong\r\ndislike manifested towards his sister by Anne of Austria. That feeling\r\nwas signally shown on the occasion of Louis XIV. completing his eleventh\r\nyear; when a grand ball was given at the Hotel de Ville, at which the\r\nyoung King, with all the principal members of the royal family and the\r\nCourt, were present. The Queen's orders were received with regard to all\r\nthe arrangements, every person of distinction being invited by her\r\ncommand, except the Duchess de Longueville. That princess, influenced by\r\ndiscontent, it is supposed, at the reception of the royal family in\r\nParis, had remained at Chantilly, on the pretence of drinking some\r\nmineral waters in the neighbourhood. The Queen seized the same pretext\r\nnot to invite her, replying to those who pressed her to do so, that she\r\nwould not withdraw her from the pursuit of health; but at length the\r\nPrince de Conde himself, demanded that she should receive a summons; and\r\nhis support was of too much consequence, and the bonds which attached\r\nhim to the Court too slight, for the Queen to trifle with his request.\r\n\r\nTo the surprise and dissatisfaction of most persons, however, Anne of\r\nAustria commanded that the ball should take place in daylight;\r\nacknowledging, in her own immediate circle, that it was in order to\r\nmortify the ladies attached to the Fronde, the principal part of whom\r\nemployed methods of enhancing their beauty and heightening their\r\ncomplexion to which the searching eye of day was very inimical. Human\r\nmalice, of course, took care that the Queen's motive should be\r\ncommunicated to all the higher circles of Paris; and as vanity is not\r\nonly a more pugnacious passion, but a much more pertinacious adversary\r\nthan any other, the words of Anne of Austria rendered many opponents\r\nirreconcilable, who might otherwise have been gained to her cause: the\r\nfamily of the Prince de Conde naturally being among the number.\r\n\r\nFrance was then able to count the cost of having created a\r\nhero--_expendere Hannibalem_--a prince _a la Corneille_, who carried his\r\ngaze to the stars, and only spoke to mortals from the summit of his\r\ntrophies. His sister, Madame de Longueville, had also in the same\r\nfashion soared into the sphere of a goddess. The one and the other, in\r\nthe empyrean, no longer distinguished their fellow mortals from such a\r\nheight save with a smile of disdain. Great folks, as a contemporary\r\ntells us, kicked their heels in their antechambers for hours, and, when\r\ngranted an audience, were received with yawning and gaping.\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation effected during the preceding year was rather, as has\r\nbeen said, a truce between the parties than a solid peace. The\r\nParliament had retained the right of assembling and deliberating upon\r\naffairs of state, which the Court had sought to prevent: and Mazarin\r\nremained Minister, although the Parliament, the people, and even the\r\nprinces, had desired that he should cease to hold that office. It rarely\r\nhappens to states in like unfortunate emergencies that among the men who\r\nshow themselves most active and skilful in overthrowing a government\r\nthere are found those capable of conducting one; and when such do\r\nappear, the chances almost always are that circumstances hinder them\r\nfrom placing themselves in the front rank. It was to Gaston, the King's\r\nuncle, Lieutenant-General of the kingdom, that belonged, in concert with\r\nthe Regent, the chief direction of affairs; but Gaston felt himself too\r\nweak and too incapable to pretend to charge himself with such a burden.\r\nHe could never arrive at any decision, and took offence when any matter\r\nwas decided without him. Jealous of Mazarin's influence, more jealous\r\nstill of that of Conde, neither of the two could attempt to govern along\r\nwith him; and nevertheless Gaston was powerful enough to command a\r\nparty, and to hinder any one from governing without him: ready to offer\r\nopposition to everything, but impotent to carry anything into execution.\r\nIf Anne of Austria had even consented to dismiss her favourite\r\nMinister, and overcome her repugnance to the Fronde and the Frondeurs,\r\nshe could not have formed a government with the chiefs of that party.\r\nThe Duke de Beaufort, its nominal head, lacked both instruction and\r\nintelligence. De Retz, its veritable chief--an eloquent, witty, and bold\r\nman, skilful in the conduct of business, in the art of making partisans;\r\nbrave, generous, even loyal when he followed the impulses of his own\r\nmind and natural inclination--was without faith, scruple, reticence, or\r\nforesight when he abandoned himself to his passions, which urged him\r\nunceasingly to the indulgence of an excessive and irrational\r\nlibertinage. Such a man could not have replaced him who for so long a\r\nperiod had informed himself of the affairs of France under a master such\r\nas Richelieu; who, deeply versed in dissimulation, was inaccessible to\r\nany sentiment that might possibly derange the calculations of his\r\nambition. Besides, he, as well as Mazarin, would have had the Princes\r\nagainst him, and could not have resisted successfully their numerous\r\npartisans. De Retz had, through the ascendancy of his talents, great\r\ninfluence with the Parisian Parliament, but it mistrusted him; and that\r\nbody, in its heterogeneous composition, offered rather the means for an\r\nopposition than strength to the Government. Conde, to whom the state\r\nowed its glory, and the Sovereign his safety, was therefore the sole\r\nprop upon which Anne of Austria might have rested; but that young hero\r\nhad no capacity for business. He could not then have filled up the void\r\nwhich Mazarin's retirement would have created. Conde, whose natural\r\npride was still further exalted by the flattery of the young nobles who\r\nformed his train, and who obtained the nickname of _petits maitres_,\r\nonly used the influence which his position gave him to wring from\r\nMazarin the places and good things at his disposal, and of these he and\r\nhis adherents showed themselves insatiable. Thus, Conde rendered himself\r\nformidable and odious to Mazarin, and made himself detested by the\r\npeople as Mazarin's supporter, at the same time that by his arrogance he\r\nshocked the Parliament, already unfavourably disposed towards him on\r\naccount of his rapacity and his ambition.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Talon, mem. t. lxii. pp. 65-105.--Montpensier.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of things, when the singular circumstances which\r\nattended the murder of one of Conde's domestics made that prince believe\r\nthat the chiefs of the Fronde had conspired to assassinate him. He\r\nthought, by such a crime, to have found an opportunity for crushing that\r\nfaction in the persons of its chiefs, and he instituted a process in\r\nparliament against the contrivers of that murder. Public report\r\nparticularly pointed to two persons, De Retz and Beaufort; and Conde, by\r\nhis accusation, hoped to force them to quit Paris, where they found\r\ntheir principal means of influence in the populace. But in attacking\r\nthus, as it were, face to face, the two most popular men of the moment,\r\nConde showed no better tact than in dealing with the Prime Minister. He\r\nconducted himself with so much haughtiness and arrogance, that the young\r\nnobles who surrounded the soldier prince, when they wished to flatter\r\nhim, spoke of Mazarin as his slave.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] Motteville, mem. t. xxxix. p. 4.--Guy-Joly.\r\n\r\nThe process went on nevertheless. Almost all the judges were convinced\r\nof the innocence of the accused, but Conde pretended that they could not\r\nbe absolved without giving a deadly affront to himself. He demanded that\r\nat the very least the Coadjutor and Beaufort should be made to quit\r\nParis under some honourable pretext, and the Princess-Dowager de Conde\r\ndeclared that it was the height of insolence in them to remain in the\r\ncapital when it was her son's wish that they should leave it. The Queen,\r\nwho equally detested the Prince de Conde and the Frondeurs, could\r\nscarcely conceal her joy at seeing them at daggers drawn with each\r\nother; feeling certain that the moment was at hand when their\r\ndissensions would restore her supremacy.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances Conde had need of all his friends, but he\r\nconsidered that he was set at defiance, and he gave way all the more to\r\nhis wonted pride and overbearing obstinacy. He seemed to take pleasure\r\nin offending Anne of Austria and Mazarin. The young Duke de Richelieu\r\nhad been declared heir to an immense fortune, of which his aunt and\r\nguardian, the Duchess d'Aiguillon, was the depositary. The stronghold of\r\nHavre de Grace, which the Cardinal de Richelieu had formerly held as a\r\nplace of retreat, was by such title in the possession of the Duchess\r\nd'Aiguillon. Conde desired to be master of it, either for himself or for\r\nhis brother-in-law, the Duke de Longueville. The young Duke de Richelieu\r\nwas engaged to be married to Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, but the Prince\r\nhaving remarked that he had some liking for Madame de Pons, a sister of\r\nhis own first love, managed to marry him clandestinely to her in the\r\nChateau de Trye, lent him two thousand pistoles until he should be of\r\nage to enter upon possession of his property, and made him take\r\npossession of Havre de Grace. The Queen was mortally offended at such a\r\nproceeding on the part of Conde, who had moreover threatened to throw\r\ninto the sea those she might send to Havre to seize the fortress; but\r\nthe Duchess d'Aiguillon's resentment was still deeper and more active.\r\nShe was the first to tell Anne of Austria, that she would never be queen\r\nagain until she had had the Prince de Conde arrested, assuring her that\r\nall the Frondeurs would lend their hands to aid her in carrying out such\r\na resolution.\r\n\r\nAlmost at this moment, a gentleman named Jarze, attached to Conde,\r\nfoolishly took it into his head that the Queen entertained a liking for\r\nhim, and it reached her ears that Conde and his friends had amused\r\nthemselves whilst at table over their wine with Jarze's revelations of\r\nhis amour with her, and that he had begun to feel certain of getting rid\r\nof Mazarin by that means. Mazarin himself probably became somewhat\r\nalarmed, as he spoke pointedly to the Queen on the subject, who\r\npretended only to have contemplated the ridiculous side of her new\r\nadorer's gallantries. But when Jarze next made his appearance in her\r\ncabinet, she rated him roundly before the whole Court upon his absurd\r\nfatuity, and forbade him ever to enter her presence again. The Prince de\r\nConde, pretending to feel hurt at the affront put upon Jarze, early next\r\nmorning paid the Prime Minister a visit, and insolently demanded that\r\nJarze should be received that very evening by the Queen. Anne of Austria\r\nsubmitted to his dictation, but could not endure such humiliation\r\nwithout seeking to avenge herself. In a woman's heart every other\r\nspecies of resentment yields to that of wounded pride. A few lines\r\naddressed to the Coadjutor in the Queen's own handwriting, and carried\r\nby Madame de Chevreuse, brought to her side that wily priest and\r\nformidable tribune, disguised _en cavalier_. Certain negotiations,\r\nhowever, which had preceded this interview, had reached the ears of\r\nConde, who went to Mazarin to denounce the treachery. The Cardinal,\r\nglowing with a hatred which would have stopped at nothing for its\r\ngratification, laughed and jested, or flattered and soothed the object\r\nof his concealed wrath. He turned the Archbishop of Corinth into\r\nridicule when Conde blamed him for his duplicity. \"If I catch him,\" said\r\nthe Cardinal, \"in the disguise you speak of--in his feathered hat, and\r\ncloak, and military boots--I will get a sight of him for your Highness;\"\r\nand they roared at the idea of discovering the intriguer in so unfitting\r\nan apparel. But shortly afterwards in the wintry gloom of a January\r\nmidnight (1650), disguised beyond the reach of detection, and guarded by\r\na passport from the Cardinal himself, De Retz was admitted at midnight\r\nby a secret door into the Regent's room at the Palais Royal, and deep\r\nconference was held between the two. The conditions of agreement were\r\nreadily stipulated. The Coadjutor with an inconceivable address and most\r\nextraordinary success handled the threads of the intrigues consequent\r\nupon such agreement. He succeeded in making himself the confidant of\r\nGaston; he made him renounce his favourite, the Abbe de la Riviere; he\r\nengaged him in the coalition which had been just set on foot between the\r\nCourt and the Fronde, and he obtained his assent to the arrest of the\r\nPrinces. Everything succeeded that was agreed upon. The Queen-Regent, at\r\nthe moment of a council being held at the Palais-Royal, gave the fatal\r\norder, and then withdrew into her oratory. There she made the young King\r\nkneel down beside her in order to invoke Heaven in concert with herself\r\nto obtain the happy achievement of an act of tyranny which was destined\r\nto produce fresh woes to the realm, and to rekindle in it the flames of\r\ncivil war.\r\n\r\nOn the morrow of the 18th of January, 1650, all Paris was electrified at\r\nthe news of the arrest of the three Princes--Conde, Conti, and\r\nLongueville. That bold _coup d'etat_ was effected very easily and\r\nunceremoniously. The Princes went voluntarily, as it were, into the\r\nmouse-trap, by attending a great council at the Palais Royal. Anne had\r\nobtained from Conde an order for the seizure and detention of three or\r\nfour persons whose names were left in blank; and on the authority of his\r\nown signature, the hero of Rocroy and the other two princes, were led\r\nquietly down a back stair, given over to the custody of a small escort\r\nof twenty men under the command of Guitaut and Comminges, and by them\r\nconducted during the night to Vincennes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE'S ADVENTURES IN NORMANDY. THE WOMEN'S WAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE heroes having thus suddenly disappeared from the scene, the\r\npolitical stage was left clear for the performance of the heroines. We\r\nare now about to see the women, almost by themselves, carry on the civil\r\nwar, govern, intrigue, fight. A great experience for human nature, a\r\nfine historical opportunity for observing that gallant transfer of all\r\npower from the one sex to the other--the men lagging behind, led,\r\ndirected, in the second or third ranks. But those women of rank, young,\r\nbeautiful, brilliant, and for the most part gallant, were doubtless more\r\nformidable to the minister at this juncture than the men. The two lovely\r\nduchesses, De Longueville and De Bouillon, having shown during the\r\npreceding year of what they were capable; the Queen therefore gave\r\norders for their arrest. The wary lover of the fascinating politician\r\nwho had lately begun to scatter her blandishments equally upon all--La\r\nRochefoucauld--having been apprised by the captain of his quarter that\r\nsome blow was meditated by Mazarin, had sent twice to warn the Princes\r\nthrough the Marquis de la Moussaye, but who, as it appears, failed to\r\nacquit himself of that important mission. But if La Rochefoucauld's\r\nwarning failed to reach the ears of the Princes, he was more fortunate\r\nin effecting the escape of Madame de Longueville. Whilst they were\r\nseeking to arrest him as well as La Moussaye, the Queen despatched a\r\nnote to the Duchess by the Secretary of State, La Vrilliere, begging her\r\nto come to the Palais Royal. Instead of going thither she went direct to\r\nthe Hotel of the Princess Palatine--like herself beautiful, gallant, and\r\nintriguing, but endowed with a superior intellect. This lady speedily\r\nbecame the head and mainspring of the princes' party--or of the _second_\r\nFronde, and the Coadjutor, who directed the Old Fronde, was fain to\r\nrecognise in her a worthy rival, and his equal in political sagacity.\r\nFearing to be discovered if she remained under the roof of the princess,\r\na carriage was procured, and the duchess driven in it by La\r\nRochefoucauld himself to an obscure house in the Faubourg St. Germain,\r\nwhere they remained until nightfall in a cellar. Thence the Duchess and\r\nher lover set out for Normandy on horseback under the escort of forty\r\ndetermined men provided by the Princess Palatine. Brave and resolute as\r\nher brother, the sister of Conde rode northwards through that entire\r\nwinter's night and the following day, and sought no shelter until worn\r\nout with excessive fatigue she reached Rouen. But the commandant, the\r\nMarquis de Beuvron, although an old friend of the duke, declared he\r\ncould not serve her, and refused to raise the banner of revolt in that\r\nstronghold of her husband's government. Her attempt at Rouen thus\r\nreceiving a complete check, she had some hope of being received into the\r\ncitadel of Havre, but the Duchess de Richelieu, though her friend, was\r\nnot so much mistress there as the Duchess d'Aiguillon, who, on the\r\ncontrary, was full of resentment against her. Discouraged and repulsed\r\non all hands, the fugitive Duchess next made her way to Dieppe, where\r\nshe thought herself in sufficient safety to part with La Rochefoucauld,\r\nwho left her to assist the Duke de Bouillon to raise troops in\r\nAngoumois. In the fortress of Dieppe, commanded by a faithful officer of\r\nher husband, Madame de Longueville found the rest she so much needed. In\r\na brief space, with spirits recruited, she resolved to make a stand to\r\nthe uttermost against the Queen and Mazarin, and having replaced the\r\nroyal standard by that of Conde set about putting the citadel in a state\r\nof defence to resist a siege. The Queen, however, having resolved not to\r\ngive the Duchess time to raise her husband's government of Normandy into\r\nrevolt, on the 1st of February quitted Paris for Rouen. The band of\r\ngentlemen who had gathered round the beautiful Frondeuse thereupon\r\nmelted away, and Mademoiselle de Longueville, her step-daughter,\r\nafterwards Duchess de Nemours, quitted her to take refuge in a convent.\r\nAs Montigny, the commandant at Dieppe, declared that it was impossible\r\nto hold the fortress, the Duchess left the place by a secret portal,\r\nfollowed by her women and some few gentlemen. She held her way for two\r\nleagues on foot along the coast to the little port of Tourville, in\r\norder to reach a small vessel which she had prudently hired in case of\r\nneed. On reaching the point of embarkation the sea was breaking so\r\nfuriously in surf on shore, the tide being so strong and the wind so\r\nhigh, that Madame de Longueville's followers entreated her not to\r\nattempt to reach the vessel. But the Duchess, dreading less the angry\r\nwaves than the chance of falling into the Regent's power, persisted in\r\ngoing to sea. As the state of the tide and weather rendered it\r\nimpossible for a boat to get near the shore, a sailor took her in his\r\narms to carry her on board, but had not waded above twenty paces when a\r\nhuge roller carried him off his feet, and he fell with his fair burden.\r\nFor an instant the poor lady believed that she was lost, as in falling\r\nthe sailor lost his hold of her and she sank into deep water. On being\r\nrescued, however, she expressed her resolve to reach the vessel, but the\r\nsailors refusing to make another attempt, she found herself compelled to\r\nresort to some other means of escape. Horses being luckily procured, the\r\nDuchess mounted _en croupe_ behind one of the gentlemen of her suite,\r\nand riding all night and part of the following day, the fugitives met\r\nwith a hospitable reception from a nobleman of Caux, in whose little\r\nmanor-house they found rest, refection, and concealment for the space of\r\na week.\r\n\r\nThe Duchess's tumble into the sea, though a disagreeable, turned out to\r\nhave been a lucky accident, for she now learnt that the master of the\r\nvessel she had been so anxious to reach was in the interest of Mazarin,\r\nand had she gone on board she would have been arrested. At length Madame\r\nde Longueville found herself once more in Havre, and having won over the\r\ncaptain of an English ship to whom she introduced herself--like Madame\r\nde Chevreuse--in male attire, as a nobleman who had just been engaged in\r\na duel, and was obliged to leave France, she succeeded in obtaining a\r\npassage to Rotterdam. Thence, passing through Flanders, she reached the\r\nstronghold of Stenay,[1] where the Viscomte de Turenne, already\r\ncompromised with the Court for having openly espoused the Conde party,\r\nhad shortly before the Duchess's arrival also taken refuge.\r\n\r\n    [1] Stenay, taken from the Spaniards in 1641, had been given to the\r\n    Prince de Conde in 1646.\r\n\r\nIt was then that the Duchess, who, under the sway of La Rochefoucauld,\r\nhad been one of the instruments of the first Fronde war, became the\r\nmotive power of the second and far more serious one--well named by the\r\nwitty Parisians \"the women's war.\" From the citadel of Stenay, of which\r\nshe took the command, she directed the wills and actions of the men of\r\nher party, into which she thoroughly won over Turenne. Her\r\nimportunities, aided by her charms, prevailed so powerfully over his\r\nvaliant though fallible heart, that the illustrious captain, after\r\nhaving struggled painfully for some time with his conscience, allied\r\nhimself with the Spaniards by a treaty which placed him, as well as the\r\nsister of the great Conde, in the pay of the enemies of his king and\r\ncountry. The treaty effectively stipulated \"that there should be a\r\njunction of the two armies, and that the war should be carried on by the\r\nassistance of the King of Spain until a peace should be concluded\r\nbetween the two kings and the princes liberated. That the King of Spain\r\nshould engage to pay over to Madame de Longueville and to Monsieur de\r\nTurenne two hundred thousand crowns wherewith to raise and equip troops;\r\nthat he should furnish them with forty thousand crowns per month for the\r\npayment of such troops, and sixty thousand crowns per annum in three\r\npayments for _the table and equipages_ of Madame de Longueville and\r\nMonsieur de Turenne.\" This treaty duly signed, Madame de Longueville\r\nissued, in the form of a letter to his Majesty the King of France, a\r\nmanifesto very skilfully drawn up and filled with artful complaints and\r\naccusations against Mazarin, with the design of soliciting through the\r\none and the other an apology for her own conduct, as though it were\r\npossible to justify herself for having entered into a compact with the\r\nenemies of her country.\r\n\r\nIt was during her sojourn at Stenay that she lost her mother (2nd\r\nDecember, 1650). \"My dear friend,\" said the Princess de Conde to Madame\r\nde Brienne, who was with her during her last moments, \"tell that 'pauvre\r\nmiserable' who is now at Stenay the condition in which you have seen me,\r\nthat she may learn how to die.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this period, the Duke de la Rochefoucauld gave\r\nconstant proof of a rare fidelity. M. Cousin speaks very precisely on\r\nthis head. \"Whilst Madame de Longueville was pledging her diamonds in\r\nHolland for the defence of Stenay, La Rochefoucauld expended his fortune\r\nin Guienne. It was the most grievous and, at the same time, the most\r\ntouching moment of their lives and their adventures. They were far away\r\nfrom each other, but they still fondly loved; they served with equal\r\nardour the same cause, they fought and suffered equally and at the same\r\ntime.\" Abundant proofs might be instanced of this love and devotion on\r\ntheir part. La Rochefoucauld wrote unceasingly to Stenay, and gave an\r\naccount of everything he did. \"The sole aim, then, of all the Duke's\r\nexertions,\" says Lenet, \"was to please that beautiful princess, and he\r\ntook endless care and pleasure to acquaint her with all he did for her,\r\nand to deliver the princess her sister-in-law (Conde's wife), by\r\ndespatching couriers to her on the subject.\" He informs us moreover\r\nthat, \"in every juncture, he forwarded expresses to render account to\r\nthe Duchess of all that respect for her made him undertake. At this\r\nmoment, in fact, having just succeeded to his patrimonial estates\r\nthrough the death of his father, La Rochefoucauld recognised no obstacle\r\nin his path, but bravely went forward in the cause he had espoused and\r\ngenerously sacrificed his property in Angoumois and Saintonge. His\r\nancestral chateau of Verteuil was even razed to the ground by Mazarin's\r\norders, and when the tidings of it reached him, he received them with\r\nsuch great firmness\", says Lenet, \"that he seemed as though he were\r\ndelighted, through a feeling that it would inspire confidence in the\r\nminds of the Bordelais. It was further said that what gave him the\r\nliveliest pleasure was to let the Duchess de Longueville see that he\r\nhazarded everything in her service.\" It cannot be denied, in fine, that\r\nthe Duke at that time yielded himself up to a sentiment as deep as it\r\nwas sincere, and which contradicts very happily and without any possible\r\ndoubt the assertion so often hazarded that he had never loved the woman\r\nwhom he had seduced and dragged into the vortex of politics. Madame de\r\nLongueville and he adored each other at this period, says M. Cousin, and\r\nit is pleasant to be able to cite the opinion of that eminent historian\r\nupon such fact; although separated by the entire length of France, they\r\nsuffered and struggled each for the other: they had the same aim, the\r\nsame faith, the same hope. They wrote incessantly to communicate their\r\nthoughts and projects, and thus sought to diminish in imagination the\r\nenormous distance which is between Stenay and Bordeaux.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  THE PRINCESS PALATINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE arrest of the Princes had singularly complicated events on the\r\npolitical stage. It had displaced all interests, and, instead of\r\nre-uniting parties and consolidating them, it had the effect of\r\nincreasing their number. No fewer than five might be counted,\r\nrepresented by as many principal leaders, around which were grouped\r\nevery species of interest and every shade of ambition.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there was the party of Mazarin, alone against all the\r\nrest. This party had for support the ability of its chief, the\r\ninvincible predilection, the unshakeable firmness of Anne of Austria,\r\nand the name of the King. Herein lay its whole strength, but that\r\nstrength was immense. It was that which ensured the obedience of the\r\nenlightened and conscientious men who had great influence over the army\r\nand the magistrature. These men adhered to the Prime Minister through a\r\nsentiment of honour, and in consequence of their monarchical principles.\r\nAmidst the disruption of parties, they recognised no other legitimate\r\nauthority than that of the Queen Regent; but they desired as strongly,\r\nperhaps, as those of the opposite parties, that Mazarin should be got\r\nrid of. That odious foreigner exposed them all to the public animosity\r\nwhich pursued himself. Anne of Austria frequently employed the artifices\r\nof her sex to avert their opposition in council, and calm their\r\ndiscontent.\r\n\r\nThe party of the Princes, which the success of the enemies of France,\r\nduring their captivity, rendered from day to day more popular and\r\ninteresting, was composed of all the young nobility. Of its apparent\r\nchiefs, the one alone capable of directing it was the Duke de Bouillon.\r\nBut to lead a party it is necessary to identify oneself with it, and\r\ndevote oneself to it wholly; and the Duke de Bouillon had views\r\npeculiar, foreign, and even adverse to the interests of his party; and\r\nbefore such interest he placed that of the maintenance, or rather\r\nelevation, of his own house. The Duchess de Longueville, the Princess de\r\nConde, La Rochefoucauld, and Turenne had neither sufficient finesse nor\r\nskill in intrigue to be able to direct that party and struggle\r\nsuccessfully against Mazarin; but they were seconded by three men who,\r\nalthough obscure, displayed in these circumstances extraordinary talent.\r\nLenet,[1] who never quitted the Princess de Conde throughout these\r\ntroubles, but served her faithfully with his pen and advice. Montreuil,\r\nwho, although he had never published anything, was a member of the\r\nFrench Academy and secretary to the Prince de Conde. He managed, with\r\ninfinite address, and incessantly devising new means, to correspond with\r\nthe Princes, and bring the vigilance of their keepers in default. And it\r\nwas Gourville especially, who, after having worn the livery of the Duke\r\nde la Rochefoucauld as his valet, had become his man of business, his\r\nconfidant, and friend. It was Gourville who, under a heavy expression of\r\ncountenance, concealed a most subtle, most acute, and fertile\r\nintelligence. Persuasive, energetic, prompt, reflective; knowing how to\r\ngain an end by the direct road; or, under the eyes of those opposing,\r\nattaining it unperceived, by covert and tortuous ways. A man who never\r\nfound himself in any situation, however desperate it might be, without\r\nhaving the confidence that he could extricate himself from it. Did the\r\ncleverest consider a position as lost? Gourville intervened, infused\r\nhope, promised to lend a hand to it, and success was immediately certain\r\nand defeat impossible.\r\n\r\n    [1] His memoirs give reliable details of all that relates to the\r\n    Condes at this period.\r\n\r\nStill Gourville was not, even on the score of ability, the foremost\r\nspirit of his party. The person who deserved that title was a woman--the\r\ncelebrated Anne de Gonzagua, widow of Edward Prince Palatine. Through\r\nher proneness to gallantry, she did not escape the weakness of her sex;\r\nbut through her imperturbable calmness in the midst of the most violent\r\ncommotions, her elevated views, the depth of her designs, the accuracy\r\nand rapidity of her resolutions, and her skill in making everything\r\nconduce to a given end, she combined in its entire vigour the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the statesman with the soul of a conspirator. She had been\r\nthrough life the intimate friend of the mother of Conde, and she now\r\nlaboured with skill, wisdom, and perseverance for the liberation of the\r\nPrinces. And such is the ascendency obtained by talent backed by an\r\nenergetic will, that it was to her advice all the partisans of the\r\nPrinces deferred; her hand that held the threads of their various\r\nintrigues. With her De Retz treated directly, and in the whole course of\r\nthe negotiations she displayed a degree of penetration which baffled all\r\nthe subtlety of the Coadjutor; and while she foiled his devices against\r\nherself, she directed them aright against their mutual opponents. By her\r\nactivity and energy five or six separate treaties were drawn up and\r\nsigned between the different personages whose interests were concerned,\r\neach in general ignorant of his comrade's participation.\r\n\r\nIt would be presumptuous in any way to attempt, after Bossuet, a perfect\r\nportraiture of this lady, but it may be interesting to glance at the\r\nantecedents of her life up to this period.\r\n\r\nCharles de Gonzagua-Cleves, Duke of Mantua and Nevers, had, by his\r\nmarriage with Catherine of Lorraine, three daughters: the oldest, Maria,\r\nwhom he preferred to the others, or rather that his pride sought to\r\nelevate her alone to the highest destiny possible, was married\r\nsuccessively to two Kings of Poland, Ladislas Sigismond and Jean\r\nCasimir. The second, Anne, who, as the Princess Palatine, became the\r\npolitical opponent of Mazarin; and the third, Benedicte, who took the\r\nveil and died whilst yet very young at the steps of the altar. It is the\r\nromantic, agitated, and changeful existence of the second with which we\r\nare concerned: passed in tumult and ended in silence. In it may be found\r\nthe invaluable lesson of that admirable antithesis afforded by error and\r\nrepentance. Bossuet, in his eloquent, fervent oration upon the life of\r\nthat princess, was enabled to derive from a contemplation of it the\r\nhighest instruction. He has therein retraced, with an imposing\r\nauthority, the errors of a woman exclusively engrossed, during many\r\nyears, with worldly interests and earthly vanities, and also made the\r\nemphatic denial that, in their last hours, such awakened minds but\r\nrarely give themselves up without profound anguish, fitful emotion, and\r\nmortal struggle to the contemplation of imperishable joys. Anne de\r\nGonzagua experienced those extremes. She passed from incredulity and an\r\nirregular life to the most lively faith and exemplary conduct.\r\nCaptivated in turn by earth and heaven, worldly and scorning the world,\r\nsceptical and fervent, she had long centred her pride and happiness in\r\nthe political affairs of her epoch, until the day came when, wearied\r\nwith ephemeral pleasures and touched by grace, she finally renounced the\r\nthings of this life and gave herself wholly up to celestial meditation.\r\n\r\nIn her earliest youth she had been placed in the convent of\r\nFaremoustier, where nothing was neglected that could tend to inspire her\r\nwith a desire for cloister life. Her father, the Duke of Mantua, had\r\ndetermined that his two younger daughters, Anne and Benedicte, should\r\nhelp, by taking the veil, to augment the fortune of their elder sister.\r\nBenedicte submitted to her fate, but Anne soon perceived what her\r\nfather's plan was, and in her indignation she resolved to defeat it.\r\nUnlike her younger sister, she had an adventurous spirit, an ardent\r\nimagination, a strong desire to play an active part in life. Even to\r\nwithdraw from a mode of existence that was hateful to her, she made her\r\nescape from Faremoustier, and went to confide to her sister's bosom, in\r\nthe convent of Avenai, her wrath, her _ennui_, and her hopes. For awhile\r\nit seemed as though conventual life was about to exercise a strange\r\nfascination over her. The discourse and example of her sister touched\r\ndeeply the youthful heart which had proved rebellious to a parent's\r\nwill. It seemed not improbable that she would yield to persuasion that\r\nwhich she had refused to compulsion. But her destiny determined\r\notherwise. Events cast her upon another course; her imperfect vocation\r\nyielded quickly to their influence. She had been worked upon, in the\r\nsolitude of the cloister, by that mysterious yearning for an encounter\r\nwith those struggles which human passions involve, the experience of\r\nwhich can alone extinguish such yearning in certain souls. It was\r\nnecessary that she should see the world, undergo its deceptions, and be\r\nwearied of it, in order to desire repose and be capable of appreciating\r\nthe inestimable blessings of peace and silence and tranquillity.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Mantua dying in 1637, Anne was obliged to leave the cloister\r\non business connected with the paternal succession, and appeared at\r\nCourt with Marie, her elder sister. The turmoil of the world and its\r\nsensuous enjoyments speedily engrossed the young and lovely princess,\r\ninvolved her in their trammels, and only restored her to tranquillity\r\nand solitude after a lapse of many years; for at this time she also lost\r\nher sister, the youthful abbess of Avenai, and the last link which\r\nattached Anne to cloister life was severed by that death. An absorbing\r\npassion, too, was destined to confirm her relinquishment of such\r\nvocation. The youthful Henri de Guise was then one of the most brilliant\r\ngentlemen at the French Court. Grandson of the _Balafre_, his high birth\r\nfixed the eyes of all upon him, at the same time that his impetuous\r\nimagination, his profession, all the aristocratic follies of the\r\nday--remarkable duels, romantic loves, eccentricities, the adventures\r\nand elegant habits of the _grand seigneur_--had constituted him an\r\noracle of fashion and the hero of every festival. He was fascinated by\r\nthe grace and beauty of Anne de Gonzagua, and she herself, in the midst\r\nof that gallant Court which masked a real depravation under the thin\r\nvarnish of an ingenious subtlety of expression,--she herself, a disciple\r\nof the Hotel de Rambouillet, where questions of sentiment were\r\ndiscussed, studied, and analysed incessantly, knew not how to resist the\r\ngilded accents of a young, handsome, and impassioned lover. She let him\r\nsee that she loved him. He made her a promise of marriage, signed, it is\r\nsaid, with his blood; and the affair seemed to promise a happy\r\nconclusion. But their mutual inclination was thwarted by Madame de\r\nGuise. The Duchess thought that the high dignities of the Church would\r\nprocure greater wealth, honour, and power for her son than he could\r\nobtain in any other career: Henri was then Archbishop of Rheims.\r\nNevertheless, he persisted in his love for Mademoiselle de Gonzagua, and\r\nin his design of espousing her. The overtures which he made to the\r\nVatican were not in vain. He received from the Pope, with the\r\nauthorisation to again become a layman, a dispensation which his kinship\r\nto Anne rendered necessary for the celebration of their nuptials. But\r\nthe lovers did not hasten to avail themselves of such privilege,\r\napparently through dread of Richelieu, who was also opposed to their\r\nunion. Perhaps that minister, from whom nothing secret was hidden--not\r\neven the unshaped designs of the ambitious,--already suspected Henri de\r\nGuise of being favourably disposed to the interests of Spain, as well as\r\ncontrary to those of France. Anne and Henri, therefore, contented\r\nthemselves with the possibility which the complaisance of the Holy\r\nFather had given them of contracting an indissoluble bond, and with the\r\noath by which they reciprocally pledged their faith. Confiding in the\r\nhonour of the Prince whom she so ardently loved, Anne consented to\r\nfollow him, when he quitted France in order to escape from the espionage\r\nof Richelieu. Disguising herself in male attire, Anne rejoined her lover\r\nat Besancon, according to Mademoiselle de Montpensier, at Cologne\r\naccording to other writers; where, as elsewhere, she caused herself to\r\nbe called \"Madame de Guise\"--writing and speaking of her husband, and\r\ndefying the assurances which were constantly advanced of the illegality\r\nof a marriage secretly performed by a canon of Rheims in the private\r\nchapel of the Hotel de Nevers. But what are promises, marriage vows, or\r\neven bonds written in blood?\r\n\r\nHenri not long after became unfaithful to the confiding Anne by eloping\r\nwith a fair widow, the Countess de Bossut, whom he carried off to\r\nBrussels and ultimately married. Implicated in the conspiracy of the\r\nCount de Soissons, the turbulent churchman was present at the battle of\r\nMarfee, and consequently declared guilty of high treason. He therefore\r\ntook up his abode in the Low Countries, where he quietly awaited the\r\ndeath of Louis XIII. and his minister, then both moribund, to resume his\r\ncareer at the Court of France.\r\n\r\nThus abandoned by her volatile lover, and extremely compromised,\r\nMademoiselle de Gonzagua returned to Paris, where she reassumed the\r\nappellation of the Princess Anne. Her grief for awhile at her\r\nabandonment was great, but happily for Anne de Gonzagua, she was\r\npossessed of youth, and, as Madame de Motteville tells us, \"of beauty\r\nand great mental attractions.\" She had moreover sufficient address to\r\nobtain a great amount of esteem, in spite of her errors. In a few years'\r\ntime, during which she took care to avoid fresh scandal, whatever she\r\nmight have done \"under the rose,\" she made a tolerably good marriage.\r\nHer husband, her senior by two years only, was Prince Edward, Count\r\nPalatine of the Rhine, son of a king without a kingdom,--the elector\r\nFrederick,[2] chosen King of Bohemia in 1619, but who lost his crown in\r\n1620, at the battle of Prague. Prince Edward, therefore, having no\r\nsovereignty, lived at the French Court. In 1645, then, Anne de Gonzagua\r\nfound herself definitively settled at Paris, and it must be owned did\r\nnot give Henri de Guise much cause to regret his faithlessness. The\r\nirregularities of the Princess Palatine became notorious, and assuredly\r\nBossuet, in the funeral oration which he pronounced many years later, in\r\nthe presence of one of her daughters and other relatives, whilst\r\ndisplaying a prodigal eloquence, and a mastery over all oratorical\r\nresource, made use of every artifice of speech, and all the elasticity\r\nof vague terms, in speaking of that period of her life without a\r\nviolation of propriety, without disguising truths known to all, without\r\nexceeding either in blame or praise the limits imposed by good taste\r\nupon the reverend orator when he pronounces a panegyric upon those who\r\nnot unfrequently have very little merited it.\r\n\r\n    [2] This unfortunate Prince had married, in 1613, Elizabeth,\r\n    daughter of James I. of England. The celebrated Prince Rupert and\r\n    Sophia, Electress of Hanover, were among the other children.\r\n\r\nDuring those stormy years of the civil wars, through her diplomatic\r\ntalents, Anne de Gonzagua shone conspicuously in the front rank of\r\nfemale politicians. One can readily imagine what must have been, not in\r\nthe first Fronde, all parliamentary as it was, but in the second,\r\nentirely aristocratic, in the Fronde of the Princes, the influence of a\r\nwoman's mind at once so subtle and brilliant. It was then that Madame de\r\nChevreuse, Madame de Montbazon, Madame de Longueville, and Mademoiselle\r\nde Montpensier, displayed upon the political stage the resources of\r\ntheir finesse, their dissimulation, or their courage. The Palatine did\r\nnot fall below the level of those adventurous heroines. In the midst of\r\nthose intrigues, of that puerile ambition, of those turnings and\r\nwindings, perfidy, seduction, manoeuvring promises, of those\r\nnegotiations in which Mazarin infused all his Italian cunning, the Queen\r\nher feminine impatience and her Spanish dissimulation, De Retz his\r\ngenius of artist-conspirator, Conde his pride of the prince and the\r\nconqueror, Anne de Gonzagua handled political matters with a rare\r\nsuppleness, humouring offended self-love, impatient ambition, haughty\r\nrivalries, acting as mediatrix with a wonderful amount of conciliatory\r\ntact, the friend of divers chiefs of parties, and meriting the\r\nconfidence of all.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to relate here her various negotiations, to go over\r\nher discourses, conversations, and numerous letters: it would involve a\r\nhistory of the Fronde, and that is not our subject. It will suffice to\r\nsay that she obtained the esteem of all parties at a time when parties\r\nnot only hated but strangely defied each other, and that she manifested\r\na skill, a tact which Cardinal de Retz--a good judge of such\r\nmatters--does not hesitate to praise with enthusiasm. \"I do not think,\"\r\nsays he, \"that Queen Elizabeth of England had more capacity for\r\ngoverning a state. I have seen her in faction, I have seen her in the\r\ncabinet, and I have found her in every respect equally sincere.\" This\r\neulogium may be perhaps a little over-coloured. But Madame de\r\nMotteville, who also greatly admired the Palatine, probably approaches\r\nnearer to the truth. \"This princess,\" she says, \"like many other ladies,\r\ndid not despise the conquests of her eyes, which were in truth very\r\nbeautiful; but, besides that advantage, she had that which was of more\r\nvalue, I mean wit, address, capacity for conducting an intrigue, and a\r\nsingular facility in finding expedients for succeeding in what she\r\nundertook.\" Thus spoke the Coadjutor and the Court of her. The\r\nparliamentary party, by the organ of the councillor Joly, confirms such\r\npanegyric: \"She had so much intelligence, and a talent so peculiar for\r\nbusiness, that no one in the world ever succeeded better than she did.\"\r\nThe Princess Palatine's political dexterity cannot therefore be\r\ncontested: the testimony of the most opposite camps are thereupon\r\nagreed, and it is certain that, without the least exaggeration, it may\r\nbe said that no one at that epoch, save Mazarin, better understood the\r\nresources of diplomacy.\r\n\r\nIt was especially after the arrest of the Princes that her zeal and\r\nintelligence found occasion to manifest themselves. Madame de\r\nLongueville, as has been said, instantly sought the aid of Anne de\r\nGonzagua when she learned that her two brothers and her husband were\r\nprisoners. The news made her swoon, and her despair was afterwards\r\npitiable. The Princess Palatine was touched by it, and promised to\r\noperate on behalf of the Princes. From that moment she became, without\r\nentering into faction and especially without failing in her duties\r\ntowards a sovereign whom she loved, one of the most active friends of\r\nthe prisoners. Meetings were held under her roof to deliberate upon that\r\nimportant affair, and, to compass her ends, she contrived to bring into\r\nplay the most varied resources. She began by interesting in the Princes'\r\ndestiny those even who might have been thought the most irreconcileable\r\nenemies to them. However difficult this work was of accomplishment, she\r\nreunited, as in a fasces, in a single will, personages widely separated\r\nupon other points, and surprised to find that they were pursuing the\r\nsame object, for none of them knew the motives which influenced the\r\nactions of the rest. On this head, Bossuet says, with somewhat excessive\r\nlaudation, she declared to the chiefs of parties how far she would bind\r\nherself, and she was believed to be incapable of either deceiving or\r\nbeing deceived. That is rather a hazardous assertion, for if she indeed\r\naided in the liberation of the Princes, none of the promises she\r\nmade--in all sincerity doubtless--became realised. But, says Bossuet\r\nfurther, and this time with more precision, \"her peculiar\r\ncharacteristic was to conciliate opposite interests, and, in raising\r\nherself above them, to discover the secret point of junction and knot,\r\nas it were, by which they might be united.\" She had resolved to win over\r\nthe Duke d'Orleans, Madame de Chevreuse, De Retz, and the keeper of the\r\nseals, Chateauneuf. She therefore signed with them four different\r\ntreaties. With the Duke d'Orleans she promised the hand of the young\r\nDuke d'Enghien in marriage to one of the Prince's daughters; to Madame\r\nde Chevreuse that of Mademoiselle de Chevreuse to the Prince de Conti;\r\nto De Retz, the cardinal's hat; to Chateauneuf, the post of prime\r\nminister. All consented to favour the princess's designs, and Mazarin,\r\nwhom she could not convince, found himself surrounded by enemies whose\r\nunion was formidable. That minister made allusion to the dread with\r\nwhich he was inspired when he remarked some years afterwards to Don\r\nLouis de Haro: \"The most turbulent among the men does not give us so\r\nmuch trouble to keep him in check as the intrigues of a Duchess de\r\nChevreuse or a Princess Palatine.\" In vain, according to his wont, did\r\nhe again attempt to temporise. Anne de Gonzagua, who was ready to open\r\nfire with all her batteries, sought to terrify him by the perspective of\r\na menacing future. \"She caused him to be informed that he was lost if he\r\ndid not determine upon giving the Princes their liberty, assuring him\r\nthat if he did not do it promptly he would see, in a few days, the whole\r\nCourt and every cabal banded against him, and that all aid would fail\r\nhim.\" Mazarin, obstinate in his determination, and unwilling to believe\r\nthat she had so thoroughly played her game as to hold in hand the\r\nthreads of so many intrigues, begged her to defer the matter, asked time\r\nfor reflection, and conducted himself in such a way in short that the\r\nprincess saw clearly that he only wanted to gain time. She therefore\r\nhesitated no longer, but allowed those who were agitating impatiently\r\naround her to commence action.\r\n\r\nThe party of the Princes had been dubbed by the name of the _New\r\nFronde_. The old, although it had lost its energy by its union with the\r\nCourt, preserved nevertheless its hatred to the prime minister. It was\r\nnot in De Retz's power to neutralise wholly these hostile dispositions;\r\nbut he could hinder them from being brought into dangerous activity. The\r\nCoadjutor at first with that view acted in good faith, and remained\r\nfaithful in the first moments of the agreement which he had entered into\r\nwith the Queen. Probably it might then have been possible to attach him\r\nfinally to the Court party; but Mazarin could not believe that the\r\nCoadjutor, so fertile in tricks, so full of finesse, was capable of\r\nanything like frankness and generosity. In the practical experience of\r\nlife, mistrust has its perils as well as blind confidence, and failure\r\nas often happens to us through our unwillingness to believe in virtue,\r\nas through our inability to suspect vice. Mazarin judged after himself a\r\nman who resembled him in many respects, but not in all. Moreover, he\r\nfeared lest he might seek to win the Queen's affection from him; and\r\nthat fear was not groundless. De Retz saw himself the object of the\r\nsuspicions and afterwards of the machinations of a power which laboured\r\nat his destruction, whilst for that power he was compromising his\r\ninfluence and his popularity. To reacquire it, he hastened, therefore,\r\nto throw himself with all his adherents on the side of the Princes, and\r\nsaw no safety but in their deliverance. This alliance of the two camps,\r\nso long enemies, was concluded between the Coadjutor and the Princess\r\nPalatine, and rendered so firm and secret by the confidence with which\r\nthese two party chiefs inspired each other, that Mazarin, who\r\nunceasingly dreaded such a union, and who always suspected it, did not\r\nknow it for certain until it revealed itself by its effects.[3]\r\n\r\n    [3] Motteville--Joly--Lenet.\r\n\r\nThe parliament formed a fourth party. Not that that body was unanimous;\r\nbut it had within itself an honourable majority which was alike inimical\r\nto the Frondeurs, the seditious, and the minister. The parliament\r\ntherefore would have been disposed to unite itself to the Princes'\r\nparty, and to lend it support; but to do so it would have been necessary\r\nthat the chiefs of that party should renounce all alliance with the\r\nforeigner. Turenne and Madame de Longueville had joined with the\r\nSpaniards to fight against France. The young Princess de Conde, with the\r\nDukes de Bouillon and de la Rochefoucauld, who had shut themselves up in\r\nBordeaux, had entered into an alliance with them, and had received from\r\nthem succour in the shape of money. The Spanish envoys in Paris\r\nconferred daily with the chiefs of the old as of the new Fronde.\r\n\r\nGaston, who might have been the moderator of all these parties, formed\r\nby himself a fifth among them. His irresolution prevented him giving\r\nstrength to any other of the factions, but he constituted a formidable\r\nobstacle to all the rest. His inclination, as well as his interest,\r\nshould never have made him deviate from the Court party; yet he was\r\nalways opposed to it. Impelled by his jealousy of Conde and of the prime\r\nminister, he acted in a manner contrary to his own wishes. He was,\r\nhowever, neither wanting in intelligence nor finesse, nor even a certain\r\nkind of eloquence; and the master-stroke of De Retz's address was to\r\nhave contrived, in furtherance of the object of his designs, to set\r\nGaston with the Fronde against the Princes, and afterwards for the\r\nPrinces against Mazarin.\r\n\r\nThe complication and the multiplicity of parties was as nothing in\r\ncomparison to that of private interests, which so crossed each other and\r\nin so many different ways, which turned with such mobility, that, in the\r\nignorance which prevailed of the secret motives of the principal actors\r\nin that drama so vivid, motley, and turbulent, nothing could be\r\npredicated of what they would do, and a looker-on might have been\r\ndisposed at times to have pronounced them as insensates, who were rather\r\ntheir own enemies than those of their antagonists.\r\n\r\nIf the libels of those times are to be credited, and especially the\r\nsatire in verse for which the poet Marlet was sentenced to be hanged,\r\nthe obstinacy with which the Queen exposed to danger her son's crown, by\r\nretaining a minister detested by all, would be naturally explained by a\r\nreason other than that of a reason of state. The advocate-general Talon,\r\nMadame de Motteville, and the Duchess de Nemours exculpate Anne of\r\nAustria on this head. They are three respectable and trustworthy\r\nwitnesses; and, without any doubt, that which they said they thought.\r\nBut the Duchess d'Orleans, Elizabeth-Charlotte, affirms in her\r\ncorrespondence[4] that Anne of Austria had secretly married Cardinal\r\nMazarin, who was not a priest. She says that all the details of the\r\nmarriage were known, and that, in her time, the back staircase in the\r\nPalais Royal was pointed out by which at night Mazarin reached the\r\nQueen's apartments. She observes that such clandestine marriages were\r\ncommon at that period, and cites that of the widow of our Charles the\r\nFirst, who secretly espoused her equerry, Jermyn. One might be disposed\r\nto think that the Duchess Elizabeth-Charlotte could have only followed\r\nsome tradition, and that her assertions cannot counterbalance the\r\nstatements of the contemporary personages above mentioned. But certain\r\nspecies of facts are often better known long after the death of the\r\npersons to whom they relate, than during their lifetime, or at a time\r\nclose upon their decease; they are not entirely unveiled until there no\r\nlonger exists any motive to keep them secret. Of the Queen's sentiments\r\ntowards Mazarin there can be no doubt after reading a letter which she\r\naddressed to him under date of June 30, 1660, which is extant in\r\nautograph,[5] the avowal she made to Madame de Brienne in her\r\noratory,[6] the confidences of Madame de Chevreuse to Cardinal de\r\nRetz.[7] Moreover, whatever may have been the motives of Anne of\r\nAustria's attachment to Mazarin, it is certain that they were\r\nall-powerful over her. She lent herself to every project formed by her\r\nminister for the increase of his power and fortune. The war in Bordeaux\r\nwas kindled because Mazarin desired that one of his nieces should be\r\nunited to the Duke de Candale, son of the Duke d'Epernon; and, in order\r\nnot to let the Swiss soldiers march thither without their pay, when\r\ntheir aid was most necessary, Anne of Austria put her diamonds in\r\npledge, and would not allow Mazarin to be answerable for the sum\r\nrequired to be disbursed.\r\n\r\n    [4] Mem. sur la Cour de Louis XIV. et de la Regence,\r\n    d'Elizabeth-Charlotte Duchesse d'Orleans, Mere du Regent. 1823,\r\n    p. 319.\r\n\r\n    [5] MS.

The majority of the women therefore\r\nwho meddled with politics were, through sympathy, of his party. The\r\nglory of France under lock and key! The young hero arrested for treason,\r\nand prisoner to whom? The foreign Cardinal Mazarin. All the spoils of\r\nthe Condes distributed amongst the _sbires_ of the favourite,--Normandy\r\nto Harcourt, Champagne to L'Hospital, &c. A monstrous alliance between\r\nKing and people. The Queen keeping the Bastille in the hands of\r\nBroussel's son--the highest posts bestowed upon the magistrates--a\r\nreversal, in fact, of everything. Did not the French nobility rise to a\r\nman against such a state of things?\r\n\r\nNo, everything was at a standstill. Neither Conde's military clients,\r\nnor his numerous seigniories, nor his governments took any active part\r\nwhatsoever. Far from it, Madame de Longueville, as we have seen, who\r\nthought to raise Normandy, everywhere met with a repulse in that\r\nprovince. Neither Turenne nor she could do anything save by accepting\r\naid from Spain, for which Madame de Bouillon was also doing her best in\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nBut whilst that lovely amazon, Conde's sister, was occupied in her\r\nendeavours to lure the hero of Stenay into the party of revolt by\r\nintoxicating him with love, and wasting time in negotiation and parade,\r\na succour more direct and much more energetic was given to Conde from a\r\nquarter he had the least expected--from his own chateau of Chantilly. He\r\nhad there left his aged mother, his young wife, and a son seven years\r\nold. Mazarin hesitated to have these ladies arrested, fearing the force\r\nof public opinion. The mother went to hide herself in Paris, and one\r\nmorning appeared before the Parliament, suppliant, weeping sorely,\r\nstooping so far as to kneel in prayer, to flattery, and even to\r\nfalsehood. All being unavailing, she went home to die.\r\n\r\nBut most astonishing was the unexpected courage of Conde's young wife,\r\nClaire Clemence de Maille, that despised niece of Richelieu, whom the\r\nvictorious soldier had married under compulsion, and whose heir was the\r\nson of the minister's absolute will. On the arrest of her husband she\r\nhad been confided to the care of a man of capacity--Lenet, from whose\r\n\"Memoirs\" we have already cited. He at first conducted her and her son\r\nin safety from Chantilly to Montrond, a stronghold of the Condes, but\r\nfearing to be besieged in it, straightway to Bordeaux. The Parliament of\r\nGuienne had had a deadly quarrel with Mazarin for imposing upon them\r\nEpernon, a governor they detested, and whom the Cardinal was bent upon\r\nallying by marriage with his own family. Great therefore was the emotion\r\nof this city and parliament at seeing that young lady of two-and-twenty\r\nin deep mourning, with her innocent boy, who caught the brave Bordelais\r\nby their beards with his little hands, and besought their help towards\r\nthe liberation of his father. The Princess's retinue enhanced not a\r\nlittle this favourable impression, formed as it was of high-born women,\r\nfor the most part young and charming.\r\n\r\nThe popular explosion was lively, as always happens among the people of\r\nthe south. But even the narrative of Lenet shows clearly the slender\r\nfoundation upon which this semblance of popular insurrection rested. The\r\nlower orders, then living in great misery, hoped to obtain through the\r\nPrincess some opening for their foreign trade, which would better enable\r\nthem to dispose of their wines and help them to live. Mazarin kept down\r\nthe local Parliament, and carried everything through sheer terror.\r\nBouillon and La Rochefoucauld, the Princess's advisers, recommended that\r\na royal envoy should be cut to pieces. Lenet dreaded lest such an act,\r\nsomewhat over-energetic, might render his mistress less popular. Twice\r\nor thrice the populace were very nearly putting the Parliament to the\r\nsword, the majority of which was kept under through sheer terror of the\r\nknife. Spain promised money, and they had the simplicity to believe her.\r\nShe hardly gave them a pitiful alms. Meanwhile, however, Mazarin, having\r\nquietly occupied Normandy and Burgundy, made his way towards Guienne\r\nwith the royal army. The Bordelais showed an intrepid front, though\r\nsomewhat disquieted to see the soldiery about to gather the fruits of\r\nthe vintage instead of themselves. The Princess only maintained herself\r\nin the place through the aid of the rabble _va-nu-pieds_, who feasted\r\nand danced all night at her expense, and who shouted in her ears a\r\nhundred ribald jests against Mazarin, compelling both herself and her\r\nson to repeat them. This abasement into which she had fallen made her\r\ndesire peace for herself, and permission to leave the city, which was\r\ngranted to her, with vague promises of liberating Conde (3rd October,\r\n1650).\r\n\r\nThe Duchess de Bouillon had been quite as ardent in politics during the\r\nburlesque activity of the Fronde as Madame de Longueville; and although,\r\nperhaps, equally beautiful, happily she was entirely devoted to her\r\ndomestic duties. Her husband on taking flight had been constrained to\r\nleave her behind in Paris, she being near her accouchement, which\r\ncircumstance however did not prevent the Queen from giving an order for\r\nher arrest. Although the royal guards were already in the house, the\r\nDuchess contrived to effect the escape of her sons, and during that same\r\nday gave birth to her babe. Shortly afterwards she found a means of\r\neluding the guard set over her, and would have rejoined her husband, had\r\nher daughter not been attacked with small-pox, but having returned home\r\nto nurse her, was arrested at her bedside and carried to the Bastille.\r\nThe Duchess de Chevreuse, always gallant, in spite of waning beauty,\r\nconstituted herself the mediatrix between the Queen and the _Frondeurs_;\r\nand although her daughter had openly become the mistress of the\r\nCoadjutor, it was already contemplated to make her the wife of the\r\nPrince de Conti, as a condition of the arrangement by which he should be\r\nset free. Beaufort still continued to be the obsequious lover of Madame\r\nde Montbazon, and, through her, Mazarin was kept well acquainted with\r\nall his secrets.\r\n\r\nNo other power than that of female influence could have attached the\r\nFrench nobility to the Prince de Conde, and determined it to take up\r\narms for his release. In fact, his hauteur, his brusquerie, his\r\nbrutality even, had, in repeated instances, offended that body, and the\r\nQueen imagined that the bulk of the French gentry would witness his\r\narrest with as much pleasure as the citizens. But the women had been\r\nfascinated by the _eclat_ of his four victories; they agreed to call\r\nhim the champion, the hero of France, and it seemed to them that they\r\nshared his heroism in devoting themselves to his cause. As for the\r\nhigher nobility, they were not bound by any political principle; they\r\nwere very indifferent to the grandeur of France; very ignorant of its\r\npretensions in foreign affairs, or to what it had been pledged with\r\nother nations. They loved war in the first place for its dangers, and in\r\nthe second for the honours and wealth they got by fighting; but even in\r\nthe army, far from making fidelity and obedience a rule of conduct, they\r\ncherished a spirit of independence and resistance to the Crown, and\r\nwould only allow themselves to be influenced by their chivalric usages.\r\nThey gloried in showing themselves reckless of the future, caring more\r\nabout the glitter of the present than steady progressive advancement;\r\nequally prodigal of fortune as of life, they were prone to follow\r\nimpulse rather than calculation; so that what we should perhaps call a\r\nreckless frivolity was looked upon by them as a sentiment invested with\r\nall the charm of brilliant gallantry. Those even whom neither their\r\naffection nor their interest summoned to the standards of the captive\r\nPrinces, rushed gaily from the midst of their ease and festivity into\r\ncivil war at the first prompting of their mistresses.\r\n\r\nGaston d'Orleans, after having consented to the imprisonment of the\r\nPrinces, only decided upon entering into the project for their\r\ndeliverance under promise of a marriage of his daughter, the Duchess\r\nd'Alencon, with the boy-Duke d'Enghien, Conde's son. Turenne and La\r\nRochefoucauld, too, often thought less of their glory or the success of\r\ntheir party, than of what might be agreeable to the Duchess de\r\nLongueville, of whose love they were so envious. More obscure\r\n_liaisons_, which have even escaped the anecdotic abundance of the\r\nmemoir-writers of those days, appear also to have exercised their\r\ninfluence over the conduct of the highest personages. In a letter which\r\nDe Retz wrote to Turenne, and which he frankly characterises as being\r\nremarkably silly, the Coadjutor does not disguise that amongst many\r\nserious motives which he gives that great warrior for inducing him to\r\ndetermine upon peace, he does not forget to hold out a hope of his\r\nseeing once more a little grisette of the Rue des Petits-Champs, whom\r\nTurenne loved with all his heart. The feeblest motives had influence\r\nover such men, all young and ardent as they were--the followers of\r\ndifferent factions, though without prejudices, principles, convictions,\r\nwithout hatred and without affection. The women therefore naturally\r\nplayed important parts in all these events, to whom the species of\r\ngallantry and worship of beauty held in honour by the Hotel de\r\nRambouillet was quite familiar. Thus nothing could be expected of the\r\nDuke de Beaufort, even in that which concerned him closest, if not\r\nassured previously of the consent of the Duchess de Montbazon, who\r\nexercised plenary power over him. Nemours, enamoured of the Duchess de\r\nChatillon, loved likewise by the Prince de Conde, warmly embraced the\r\ncause of that Prince, because his mistress prompted him thereto; and the\r\nDuchess de Nemours had moved heaven and earth to obtain Conde's\r\ndeliverance, in the hope that he would keep sharp watch over the Duchess\r\nde Chatillon, and put a stop to her husband's infidelity.\r\n\r\nDe Retz too, notwithstanding the superiority of his intellect, allowed\r\nhimself to give way, through his inclination for the fair sex, to the\r\ncommission of indiscretions and imprudences which often placed his life\r\nin danger, and caused his best-concerted measures to prove abortive. To\r\nappease the jealousy of Mademoiselle de Chevreuse he permitted himself\r\nto make use of a contemptuous expression concerning the Queen, which was\r\nrepeated, and which became the cause of the violent hatred she ever\r\nafterwards bore him. The Princess de Guemenee, furious at having been\r\nabandoned, offered the Queen, if she would consent to it, to procure the\r\ndisappearance of the Coadjutor by sending him an invitation, and then\r\nhaving him confined in a cellar of her hotel. De Retz learned that a\r\ndesign to assassinate him had been formed, and whenever he repaired to\r\nthe Hotel de Chevreuse, by way of precaution placed sentinels outside\r\nthe gate of that mansion, and quite close to the Queen's sentries who\r\nguarded the Palais-Royal, without heeding the effect such an excess of\r\ninsolence and scandal produced. With every kind of talent fitting to\r\ndominate party spirit, he failed to acquire the confidence of anyone. He\r\nregarded all alliance with the foreigner as odious and impolitic; and\r\nnotwithstanding, when his embarrassments increased, he lent an ear to\r\nthe Archduke's envoy, and even to that of Cromwell. At the same time,\r\nfull of admiration for the Marquis of Montrose, whom he called a hero\r\nworthy of Plutarch, he contracted the closest friendship with the\r\nScottish royalist, and aided him to the utmost of his ability in the\r\nefforts he was making to restore to the throne the legitimate King of\r\nGreat Britain. De Retz, in few words, appeared anxious to show himself\r\nas taking pleasure in exhausting every kind of contrast. When the\r\nintricate plot of the drama in which he was engaged had become so\r\ncomplicated by his intrigues, that he no longer saw the possibility of\r\nunravelling it, he sought means to retire from the situation with the\r\ngreatest advantage practicable for himself and friends, and to obtain\r\nthe Cardinal's hat. The marriage of Mademoiselle de Chevreuse with the\r\nPrince de Conti became the essential condition of all the negotiations\r\nwhich he carried on, whether with the Court or with the Duchess de\r\nChevreuse. The remembrance of an old and close friendship, the habit of\r\na familiarity contracted in youth, gave the Duchess de Chevreuse a means\r\nof influence over that Queen, so fixed in her hatred, so inconstant in\r\nher friendships. Anne of Austria, who then, moreover, found herself very\r\nmiserable through the obstacles which so many factions created, had\r\npartially restored the Duchess to her confidence. Madame de Chevreuse\r\nappeared also to have the same interests as De Retz, since, like him,\r\nshe desired intensely the union of her daughter with a Prince of the\r\nblood. But she had large sums of money to recover from the Government,\r\nand the success of her claims depended on the decision of the prime\r\nminister. She therefore used her utmost tact with Mazarin, negotiating\r\nat the same time with him, as well as with the Old and the New Fronde.\r\nShe turned to her own profit the influence that her connections at\r\nCourt, with the Coadjutor, and with the Princes gave her in all the\r\nseveral factions. She was assisted in her intrigues by the Marquis de\r\nLaignes, a man of courage but little intellect, who, from the time of\r\nher exile at Brussels, had declared himself her lover in order to gain\r\nimportance in the faction of the Fronde, which he had embraced. As\r\nlittle more of the attractions of her youth were left to Madame de\r\nChevreuse, save their pristine celebrity, she had not always to\r\ncongratulate herself upon the good humour and behaviour of De Laignes.\r\nThe latter had been until then wholly devoted to the Coadjutor; but De\r\nRetz soon perceived that De Laignes entered into projects different from\r\nhis own. At length, to have some one who could be responsible to him\r\nfor Madame de Chevreuse, he endeavoured to substitute Hacqueville as a\r\ngo-between in the place of De Laignes. Hacqueville was the intimate\r\nfriend of De Retz and also of Madame de Sevigne; and seconded by Madame\r\nde Chevreuse and Madame de Rhodes, De Retz might have succeeded in the\r\nexpulsion of Laignes, if Hacqueville would have consented to that\r\nproject. No man could be more obliging than Hacqueville; but,\r\nnotwithstanding the disposition he showed to be useful to his friends,\r\nhe shrank from such continual immolation of himself. Probably also he\r\nwas too honest a man to lend himself to such a procedure.\r\n\r\nMadame de Sevigne,--in every way qualified to play a distinguished part\r\nin the exciting game of politics,--was so entirely devoted to her\r\nhusband and children as to be a stranger to all these intrigues; but she\r\nwas more or less connected with the persons who seconded the Coadjutor's\r\nprojects, and consequently with the Duchess de Chevreuse. An article in\r\nthe \"Muse Historique\" of Loret shows how intimate was the connection of\r\nMadame de Sevigne with that Duchess. In the month of July, 1850, on\r\nreturning from a promenade in the Cours, then the fashionable drive\r\namong the highest society, the Marquis and Marchioness de Sevigne gave a\r\nsplendid supper to the Duchess de Chevreuse. The noisy manner in which\r\nthe Frondeurs expressed their delight made this nocturnal repast almost\r\nassume the character of an orgie; and, for that reason, it became for\r\nawhile the talk of the capital. The rhyming gazetteer thus expresses\r\nhimself on the subject:\r\n\r\n  On fait ici grand' mention\r\n  D'une belle collation\r\n  Qu'a la Duchesse de Chevreuse\r\n  Sevigne, de race frondeuse,\r\n  Donna depuis quatre ou cinq jours,\r\n  Quand on fut revenue du Cours.\r\n  On y vit briller aux chandelles\r\n  Des gorges passablement belles;\r\n  On y vit nombre de galants;\r\n  On y mangea des ortolans;\r\n  On chanta des chansons a boire;\r\n  On dit cent fois non--oui--non, voire.\r\n  La Fronde, dit-on, y claqua;\r\n  Un plat d'argent on escroqua;\r\n  On repandit quelque potage,\r\n  Et je n'en sais pas davantage.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] Loret, Muse Historique, liv. i., p. 28, Letter 10.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from these details, that already the manners and customs\r\nof the great world reflected the licence of the civil wars, and that\r\nthey no longer resembled those of which the Hotel de Rambouillet still\r\npresented a purer model. It may be possible also that there was some\r\nexaggeration in Loret's description: he belonged to the Court party,\r\nreceived a pension of two hundred crowns from Mazarin, and detested the\r\nFronde. His rhyming gazette was addressed to his protectress,\r\nMademoiselle de Longueville, so much the more opposed to the Fronde that\r\nher stepmother was the heroine of that faction. Mademoiselle de\r\nLongueville, whose harsh strictures upon the Conde family have been\r\ncited, and who subsequently became the wife of the Duke de Nemours, is\r\noften mentioned in the writings of her time, although she was never\r\nmixed up in any political intrigue, nor took part in any event. Her\r\nimmense fortune, the clearness of her judgment, the elevation of her\r\nsentiments, her grand airs, the severe dignity of her manners, and the\r\nenergy of her character, constituted her during the Regency and the\r\nlong reign of Louis XIV. a personage quite apart; who submitted herself\r\nto no influence whatever, social or political, and who no more permitted\r\nthat absolute monarch to induce her to vary in her determinations, than\r\nto change the fashion of her external habiliments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  STATE OF PARTIES ON THE LIBERATION OF THE PRINCES--THE CARDS AGAIN\r\n  SHUFFLED, AND THE FACE OF THE SITUATION CHANGED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAT the commencement of 1651 all France clamoured for Conde's liberation.\r\nDuring the autumn Mazarin had led the Queen and the young King against\r\nBordeaux, then held by the Princess de Conde, carrying--as usual when\r\nforced to use both means--a sword in one hand and a roll of parchment in\r\nthe other. Failing to carry the place with the first, the Cardinal began\r\nto negotiate a treaty of peace, the principal item of which was full\r\npardon to the citizens, and by others an agreement that the Princess and\r\nher son should retire to Montrond: on these terms the city yielded to\r\nits sovereign. The Cardinal also obtained a victory in the field against\r\nTurenne, who had entered the service of Spain and fired upon the\r\nfleur-de-lis. But with this momentary success of Mazarin's cause rose\r\nhis pretensions and demands; and the Fronde, alarmed at his recovered\r\nauthority, changed its tactics as its Protean genius De Retz frequently\r\ndid his clothes--his cassock for a plumed hat and military cloak. It\r\ndemanded the trial or liberation of the prisoners it had helped to send\r\nto Vincennes, without delay, and Mazarin removed them for safe custody\r\nto Havre. It then pronounced sentence of banishment on the obnoxious\r\nminister, and ordered him to quit the kingdom within fifteen days. The\r\ntown militia kept watch and ward over the Queen, by the command of the\r\nCoadjutor, and hindered her flight to join the favourite. She could\r\noffer no further resistance to those who now called themselves the\r\nfriends of Conde, but who were the very same persons who had fought him\r\nin the field a few months before. Orders were given to set the captives\r\nat liberty. Mazarin himself went to Havre to communicate the news of\r\ntheir freedom, and was received by them with the contempt that he might\r\nhave expected. Conde took leave of the Cardinal with a ringing peal of\r\nlaughter, and with joyous acclamations, and bonfires, and firing of\r\nguns, made his triumphal entry into Paris.\r\n\r\nConde was now master of the situation. He found himself equally courted\r\nby the two other chief parties into which the State was divided--the\r\nQueen's, supported by the Duke de Bouillon, and the now repentant and\r\npardoned Turenne--and the Fronde, which had fallen into the guidance of\r\nthe Duke d'Orleans, the Coadjutor, and the Duchess de Chevreuse. His own\r\nwas called \"the Prince's,\" and comprised Rochefoucauld and other\r\npersonal friends and military admirers. The Duke d'Orleans had gone on\r\nbefore to meet Conde as far as the plain of St. Denis, accompanied by\r\nthe two most conspicuous representatives of the Fronde, the Duke de\r\nBeaufort and Retz, with the Coadjutor of Paris, and there they all\r\nwarmly embraced. The Duke, having taken the Prince into his carriage,\r\nbrought him in great pomp to the Palais Royal to salute the Queen Regent\r\nand the young King, and thence to the Palais d'Orleans, where he was\r\nfeasted magnificently. Some days afterwards (February 25th) a royal\r\nordonnance recognised the innocence of the Princes Conde, Conti, and\r\nthe Duke de Longueville, and reinstated them in all their posts and\r\ngovernments. On the 27th this ordonnance was confirmed in Parliament\r\namidst loud cheers. Conde thus found himself at the highest degree of\r\npower to which a subject could reach. Misfortune had enhanced his\r\nmilitary glory; a long captivity, endured with an unalterable serenity\r\nand high-hearted gaiety, had carried his popularity to the highest\r\npitch. He was the victor, and, as it were, the designated heir, of\r\nMazarin, who had fled before him, and with difficulty found a refuge\r\nwithout the kingdom, on the banks of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nThus, Anne of Austria in some sort a prisoner, and Mazarin proscribed,\r\nthe nobility showed itself entirely devoted to the young hero whom it\r\nrecognized as its chief. Some among them at once proposed that the Queen\r\nMother should be confined in the Val-de-Grace, and that the Prince\r\nshould himself assume the Regency, others talked even of raising him to\r\nthe throne, but Conde did not fail to perceive that his newly acquired\r\npower was not so solid as it was sought to make him believe.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mazarin having quitted Havre, and the inhabitants of\r\nAbbeville refusing him passage through their town, he found an asylum\r\nfor a few days at Dourlens; but he was soon driven thence by the\r\nproceedings of the Parliament against him. He then retired to Sedan,\r\nwhere he took counsel with his friend Fabert, whom he had appointed\r\nCommandant there. He next proceeded to Cologne, being treated with the\r\nutmost distinction and hospitality in all the foreign towns through\r\nwhich he passed.\r\n\r\nEven in banishment, however, the old influence began to work. The\r\nCardinal from his place of retirement governed the Queen with as\r\nabsolute a sway as ever, and recommended her, as a keen stroke of\r\npolicy which would neutralize all parties, to take the young King to a\r\n_Bed of Justice_, and cause him to declare his majority. Couriers were\r\ngoing daily between Paris and Cologne; treaties between the Fronde and\r\nMazarin were intercepted or forged, and published in the capital; the\r\npost of Prime Minister remained unfilled, and the Duke de Mercoeur,\r\nnotwithstanding all the thunders of Parliament, set out for Bruhl, with\r\nthe purpose of marrying Mazarin's niece. Everything announced that the\r\nexile of that hated minister was but temporary, and Conde, perceiving\r\nthe object of all these moves, prepared for war, and silently took his\r\nmeasures accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe nobility, who, from the beginning of February, had begun to assemble\r\nin order to take part in the expulsion of Mazarin, now held their\r\nmeetings in the monastery hall of the Cordeliers, where might be seen\r\ncollected together as many as _eight hundred_ princes, dukes, and\r\nnoblemen, heads of the most considerable houses in France, all partisans\r\nof Conde. As this numerical strength of the ennobled classes, together\r\nwith the multiplicity of titles among them, is somewhat startling to a\r\nyouthful English student, it may be well to remark that France had, in\r\nfact, three aristocracies in the course of her annals from the Crusades\r\nto the reign of Louis XIV. After the time of Louis XI., the\r\nrepresentatives of the _first_, or old feudal aristocracy, the\r\ndescendants of the men who were in reality the King's peers, and not his\r\nactual subjects, were few and far between. These were the holders of\r\nvast principalities, who maintained a kind of royal state in their own\r\npossessions, and kept high courts of judicature over life and limb in\r\nthe whole extent of their hereditary fiefs. In the long English wars,\r\nfrom Crecy to Agincourt, the great body of them disappeared, and only\r\nhere and there a great vassal was to be seen, distinguished in nothing\r\nfrom the other nobles, except in the loftiness of his titles and the\r\nreverence that still clung to the sound of his historic name. The\r\n_second_ aristocracy arose among the descendants of the survivors of the\r\nEnglish and Italian wars. They claimed their rank, not as coming down to\r\nthem from the tenure of almost independent counties and dukedoms, but as\r\nproprietors of ancestral lands, to which originally subordinate rights\r\nand duties had been attached. Mixed with those, we saw the Noblesse of\r\nthe Robe, as the great law officers were called, who constituted a\r\nparallel but not identical nobility with their lay competitors. The\r\n_third_ aristocracy was now about to make its appearance, the creation\r\nof Court favour, and badge of personal or official service--possessors\r\nof a nominal rank without any corresponding duty--a body selected for\r\nornament, and not for use--and incorporating with itself, not only the\r\nmarquis and viscount, fresh from the mint of the minister or favourite,\r\nbut the highest names in France.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy of the sword, and of ancient birth, had itself to blame\r\nfor this degradation. Great alterations in manners or government--such\r\nas give a new character to human affairs--always seem brought about by\r\nsome strange relaxation of morals, or atrocity of conduct, which makes\r\nsociety anxious for the change. The unfortunate custom in France which\r\ngave every male member of a noble family a title equivalent to that of\r\nits chief, so that a simple viscount with ten stalwart and penniless\r\nsons gave ten stalwart and penniless viscounts to the aristocracy of his\r\ncountry, had filled the whole land with a race of men proud of their\r\norigin, filled with reckless courage, careless of life, and despising\r\nall honest means of employment by which their fortunes might have been\r\nimproved. Mounted on a sorry steed and begirt with a sword of good\r\nsteel, the young cavalier took his way from the miserable castle on a\r\nrock, where his noble father tried in vain to keep up the appearance of\r\ndaily dinners, and wondered how in the world all his remaining sons and\r\ndaughters were to be clothed and fed, and made his way to Paris. There\r\nhe pushed his fortune--fighting, bullying, gambling, and was probably\r\nstabbed by some drunken companion and flung into the Seine. If he was\r\nlucky or adroit enough, he stabbed his drunken friend and pushed _him_\r\ninto the stream; and, after a few months of suing and importunity,\r\nobtained a saddle in the King's Guards, or a pair of boots in the\r\nMusqueteers. At this time it came out that in twenty years of the reign\r\nof Louis XIII. there had been eight thousand fatal duels in different\r\nparts of the realm. Out of the duels which were daily carried on, four\r\nhundred in each year had ended in the death of one of the combatants.\r\nWhen the fiercest of English wars is shaking every heart in the kingdom,\r\nthere would be wailing and misery in every house if it were reported\r\nthat four hundred officers had been killed in a year. Yet these young\r\ndesperadoes were all of officer's rank, and the quarrel in which they\r\nfell was probably either dishonourable or contemptible. Men fought and\r\nkilled each other for a word or a look, or a fashion of dress, or the\r\nmere sake of killing. Where morality is loosened to the extent of a\r\ndisregard of life, we may be sure the general behaviour in other\r\nrespects is equally to be deplored. There was great and almost universal\r\ndepravity in the conduct of high and low. Vice and sensuality found\r\nrefuge and protection even in the presence of princesses and queens.\r\nPeople residing in remote places heard only of the gorgeous licence in\r\nwhich the great and powerful lived. They knew them only during their\r\nvisits to their ancestral homes as worn-out debauchees from the great\r\ncity, who brought the profligacy of the purlieus of the Louvre into the\r\npeaceful cottages of the peasantry on their estates. It was, indeed, so\r\nmuch the fashion to be wicked, that a gentleman was hindered from the\r\npractice of his Christian or social duties by the fear of ridicule. The\r\nlife of man, therefore, and the honour of woman were held equally cheap;\r\nand the blinded, rash, and self-indulgent nobility laid the foundation,\r\nin contempt of the feelings of its inferiors and neglect of their\r\ninterests, for the terrible retribution which even now at intervals\r\nmight be seen ready to take its course.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  THE DUCHESSES DE LONGUEVILLE AND DE CHEVREUSE AND THE PRINCESS\r\n  PALATINE IN THE LAST FRONDE.--RESULTS OF THE RUPTURE OF THE MARRIAGE\r\n  PROJECTED BETWEEN THE PRINCE DE CONTI AND MADEMOISELLE DE CHEVREUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWE must now revert to Conde's heroic sister. Having glanced somewhat\r\nhastily at the brilliant part played by Madame de Longueville in the two\r\nfirst epochs of the Fronde, the war of Paris and that which illuminated\r\nthe prison of Conde, we are now about to follow her through the third\r\nand last period, which commences from the deliverance of the Princes, in\r\nFebruary, 1651, and only ends with the war of Guienne, in August,\r\n1653;--the longest, the most disastrous, and at the same time most\r\nobscure epoch of the civil war. It will be necessary to strip the mask\r\nfrom more than one illustrious actor in it, exhibit the reverse of the\r\nmost showy medals, and the shadows which everywhere mingle with glory,\r\ngenius, and even virtue itself. The character of the Duchess de\r\nLongueville has its charming, its sublime aspects; but, alas! it is far\r\nfrom being irreproachable. In dwelling upon the least favourable portion\r\nof her life, we shall often do well to remember that the errors of great\r\nminds sometimes subserve their perfection, by the beneficent virtue of\r\nthe remorse to which they give rise, and that the sister of the Great\r\nConde must probably have felt in all its fulness the vanity of ambition\r\nand of false grandeur, all the bitterness of guilty passions, in taking\r\nan early farewell of them, to resume the austere path of duty, to\r\nreturn, in fine, to Carmel and ascend to Port Royal.\r\n\r\nMadame de Longueville had remained at Stenay with Turenne for some time\r\nafter her brother's and husband's liberation, both occupied in\r\ndisengaging themselves from the engagements which they had contracted\r\nwith Spain for the deliverance of the Princes, and with negotiating a\r\ntruce calculated to clear the way for the much-desired general peace.\r\nRecalled by the pressing instances of her family, she had quitted Stenay\r\non the 7th of March, before the completion of her work. On arriving in\r\nParis \"universal applause greeted her heroic deeds.\" Monsieur had\r\nhastened to pay her a visit with Mademoiselle Montpensier, and a train\r\nof ladies of the highest distinction. She went afterwards that same day\r\nto present her homage to their Majesties, from whom she met with the\r\nmost gracious reception. That moment was, unquestionably, the most\r\nbrilliant of her whole career. In 1647, after the embassy to Munster,\r\nher return to France and its Court had been also a veritable triumph, as\r\nwe have attempted to show; but the power of her house and the glory of\r\nher brother constituted nearly all the merits of it. She only\r\ncontributed thereto the influence of her wit and beauty. After Stenay,\r\nthe _eclat_ which surrounded her was in some sort more personal. She had\r\njust displayed eminent qualities which raised her almost to the level of\r\nConde. In Normandy she had exhibited herself as an intrepid adventuress,\r\nand a skilful politician in the Low Countries. When, during the\r\nimprisonment of her two brothers and her husband, her sister-in-law, the\r\nPrincess de Conde, had been forced at Bordeaux to recognize the royal\r\nauthority, she discovered that the destinies of her house had devolved\r\nupon her. She had become the head of a great party. She had treated as\r\nfrom power to power with Spain; her word had appeared a sufficient\r\nguarantee to the Archduke Leopold and to the Count de Fuensaldagne. She\r\nhad held in hand such commanders as Turenne, La Moussaye, Bouteville;\r\nand when, after the battle of Rethel, she seemed to be on the very verge\r\nof destruction, she had succeeded in recovering the advantage, and in\r\ncontributing more than any one else to the deliverance of the Princes,\r\nthanks to the profound negotiations carried on in her name by the\r\nPrincess Palatine. Whilst statesmen estimated her capacity, the\r\nmultitude admired her courage and constancy. She was, in short, in\r\npossession of that political role with which La Rochefoucauld had\r\ndazzled her gaze in order to conceal his own designs:--a glittering\r\nchimera which, mingling itself with that of love, had seduced that\r\nardent and haughty soul of hers. She was then the idol of Spain, the\r\nterror of the Court, one of the grandeurs of her family. We shall soon\r\nsee whether she can better sustain this new ordeal than she did the\r\nfirst, at the close of the year 1647.\r\n\r\nThe Fronde gathered the fruit of its skilful conduct during the month of\r\nJanuary, 1651. It was that faction which, silencing its old animosities\r\nand promptly extending its hand to the partisans of Conde, had\r\nextricated him from prison, in order to acquire and place at its head,\r\ntogether with the King's uncle, the lieutenant-general of the Kingdom,\r\nthe first prince of the blood, the victor of Rocroi and Lens, the hero\r\nof the age. It carried everything before it--at Court, in parliament,\r\nupon the public places; it had proscribed and put to flight Mazarin; it\r\nheld Anne of Austria a captive in her palace; already even it had\r\npenetrated into the cabinet in the person of the aged Chateauneuf, in\r\nwhom ambition cherished beneath the snows of winter the vigour of youth,\r\nand whose capacity was scarcely inferior to his ambition. The moment had\r\narrived for accomplishing the work already begun, and for putting into\r\nexecution the plan determined upon between the Princess Palatine and\r\nMadame de Chevreuse.\r\n\r\nThose two strong-minded women had conceived the idea of a grand\r\naristocratic league which should seat the Fronde upon an union of all\r\nthe interests which it comprised, close the avenues of France and the\r\nCourt to Mazarin, and under the auspices of the Duke d'Orleans and the\r\nPrince de Conde form a government into which the friends of both should\r\nenter, the most accredited representatives of every fraction of a party.\r\nFurther, the basis of this plan was that of a double marriage: on the\r\none side between the young Duke d'Enghien and one of the Duke d'Orleans'\r\ndaughters, on the other between the Prince de Conti and the daughter of\r\nMadame de Chevreuse.[1] This latter marriage might be accomplished\r\nimmediately. Conde had accepted the proposition without any difficulty.\r\nMadame de Longueville, far from opposing it at Stenay, had embraced the\r\nidea of it with so much ardour that, in a letter to the Palatine of the\r\n26th of November, 1650, after having weighed the different resolutions\r\nto be taken, she stops at this latter, and concludes thus: \"_this,\r\ntherefore, is what we must stick to_.\" That marriage was, in short, of a\r\nsupreme importance: it gave the house of Conde to the Fronde for ever,\r\nand the Fronde to the house of Conde; for the Fronde was then Madame de\r\nChevreuse. She disposed, by her daughter, of the Coadjutor, who in his\r\nturn disposed of the Duke d'Orleans, and by him of the parliament. It\r\nwas Madame de Chevreuse who, in 1650, had emboldened Mazarin to lay his\r\nhand upon Conde, in making him see that he might strike that bold stroke\r\nwith impunity, since she answered to him for the secret connivance of\r\nthe Duke d'Orleans and the parliament, who were alone able to oppose it.\r\nHere, Mazarin had committed an immense blunder: seeing himself delivered\r\nfrom Conde, by the aid of the Fronde, having nothing more hostile to\r\ncope with than the latter, he had imagined himself able to turn round\r\nupon it, and had treated Madame de Chevreuse very cavalierly, who,\r\ngrowing cold towards the Cardinal, and no longer finding it to her\r\naccount to serve him, had lent an ear to the propositions of Conde's\r\nfriends, and had procured his release from prison, reconciling to him\r\nthe Duke d'Orleans and the parliament, which at first she had stirred up\r\nagainst him. She brought, moreover, to the house of Conde the most\r\npolitic mind of the Fronde, an audacity towering to the height of his\r\ndesigns, a consummate experience, with the support of her three powerful\r\nfamilies, the houses of de Rohan, de Luynes, and Lorraine. She rendered\r\nsure the alliance of the Duke d'Orleans and the Prince de Conde, and\r\ncompleted the ruin of Mazarin by constructing a strong government which\r\nprobably might have succeeded ultimately in triumphing over the\r\naffection of the Queen. She held in hand a statesman bred in the school\r\nof Richelieu, and whom she judged capable of replacing Mazarin, the\r\nformer Keeper of the Seals--Chateauneuf, already a member of the\r\nCabinet. She believed herself certain of acquiring De Retz by means of\r\nthe Cardinal's hat. She had not the least objection to make to the\r\nelevation of the friends of Conde, and she was ready to favour the\r\nambition of La Rochefoucauld, for whom formerly, in 1643, she had so\r\ngreatly importuned the Queen and Mazarin. Add to all this, that on\r\nquitting the citadel of Havre, the young Prince de Conti had not beheld\r\nthe lovely Charlotte de Lorraine without being smitten with her charms,\r\nand he himself strongly desired that marriage. Who, then, prevented it?\r\nWho broke off the contracted engagement? Who struck at and wounded by\r\nthe self-same blow the Palatine and Madame de Chevreuse? Who restored\r\nthem both and for ever to the Queen and Mazarin? Who destroyed the\r\nFronde by dividing it? We shall find out by-and-by, but let us merely\r\nsay just now that it was the rupture of that marriage which again\r\nshuffled the cards and changed the face of the situation. In pitting\r\nagainst himself those who had so powerfully succoured him in his\r\nmisfortune, Conde ought at least to have drawn closer to the Court and\r\nhad a serious understanding with the Queen; but he tergiversated, and at\r\nthe end of some months of that wavering policy, he found himself\r\nstanding unmasked between the Court and the Fronde, both equally\r\ndiscontented with him, repeating and exaggerating the blunder committed\r\nby Mazarin. The greatest error during the course of a revolution is to\r\nbelieve that the support of either of the parties who are in actual\r\ncollision may be dispensed with. At the close of a revolution the\r\nattempt to dominate may be tried; during the crisis a choice must be\r\nmade. Mazarin had fallen through having tried to dominate the Fronde and\r\nConde at one and the same time; Conde lost himself in thinking to\r\ndominate the Fronde and the Court.\r\n\r\n    [1] Retz himself has taken care to inform us of his sad _liaison_\r\n    with Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, throughout the whole of the second\r\n    volume and beginning of the third of his Memoirs. Amsterdam edition,\r\n    1731. That unfortunate lady died suddenly of a fever, unmarried, in\r\n    1652. She was born in 1627.\r\n\r\nIt is an historical problem very difficult to solve, as to who was the\r\nauthor of the rupture of the marriage projected between the Prince de\r\nConti and Mademoiselle de Chevreuse. We are well inclined to believe\r\nthat that individual at any rate was the chief author of the rupture to\r\nwhom it was the most profitable. The Queen and Mazarin, who from his\r\nplace of retirement governed her with as absolute a sway as ever, saw\r\nfrom the first the danger which threatened them from such an alliance,\r\nentirely unexpected as it was by both. The negotiations between Madame\r\nde Chevreuse, while Conde was prisoner, and Madame de Longueville at\r\nStenay, had been conducted by the Palatine with such consummate skill\r\nand perfect secrecy that neither the Queen nor Mazarin had the slightest\r\nsuspicion of them. When the rumour reached the ears of the Cardinal in\r\nhis retreat at Bruhl, near Cologne, he broke out against Madame de\r\nChevreuse with a violence the coarseness of which even was an\r\ninvoluntary homage rendered to the profound ability of Marie de Rohan.\r\nThe Queen showed herself warmly opposed to it, and the ministers were\r\nordered to thwart in every way the projected alliance. They began,\r\ntherefore, to negotiate with Conde. As a result of these negotiations he\r\nobtained in exchange for his government of Burgundy that of Guienne, one\r\nof far greater importance; he was even led to indulge a hope that\r\nProvence would be given to the Prince de Conti instead of Champagne and\r\nLa Brie, and the port and fortress of Blaye to La Rochefoucauld in\r\naugmentation of his government of Poitou, although there was not the\r\nslightest intention of fulfilling that hope. So states the Duchess de\r\nNemours, the enemy of the Fronde and the Condes, and who, having given\r\nherself to the Court party, must have well known its intentions. De Retz\r\nlikewise doubts not that the Queen combated an alliance so evidently\r\nopposed to her interests. Madame de Motteville, the Queen's close\r\nfriend, avows it. In short, it is certain, and we have hereupon the\r\nirrefragable testimony of Madame de Motteville, that when the Queen had\r\nsucceeded in gaining over Conde, she caused Madame de Chevreuse to be\r\ninformed \"that she desired that such marriage should not take place,\r\nbecause it had been concerted for objects inimical to the royal\r\ninterests. This command was the cause of all these propositions falling\r\nthrough and that they were no more spoken of.\"\r\n\r\nBut how did the Queen gain over Conde, and what part did Madame de\r\nLongueville play in the affair? That is certainly what neither De Retz\r\ncould know, who was only aware of what passed in parliament, in the\r\nPalais d'Orleans, and the Hotel de Chevreuse; nor the Duchess de Nemours\r\nand Madame de Motteville, who were not in the confidence of the Hotel de\r\nConde: they could only repeat hereupon what they had heard said in the\r\nCourt circle, and they must be considered solely as the echoes of\r\nreports which it suited the Queen to spread. That is so probable that\r\nthe one and the other, differing so widely as they did both in intention\r\nand feeling, tell exactly the same tale. Madame de Motteville states\r\npositively that Madame de Longueville, as soon as she returned from\r\nStenay, advised Conde to break with the Chevreuses, and that La\r\nRochefoucauld supported her in such design; and these are the motives\r\nwhich she attributes to her:--\"Madame de Longueville, who had been long\r\njealous of the beauty and graces of Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, could\r\nlittle bear to contemplate the probability of her being raised to a rank\r\neven more elevated than her own, and still less, that she should obtain\r\nthe great influence which such a person was likely to acquire over both\r\nher princely brothers. She had, therefore, exerted all her influence\r\nover Conde, and with him had been quite successful. But Conti was still\r\nin the height of his passion for the beautiful and fascinating girl who\r\nhad been promised to him during his imprisonment; he supped every\r\nevening at the Hotel de Chevreuse, and his affections, as well as his\r\nhonour, were fully engaged.\" The Duchess de Nemours says the same thing\r\nin the same terms.\r\n\r\nConfidant and adviser of Madame de Longueville and of Conde, La\r\nRochefoucauld alone knew the whole truth, and could have told it to\r\nposterity; but it was not to tell the truth that his memoirs were\r\npenned, only too frequently to conceal it, to set in strong relief that\r\nwhich had been well done, and slur over that which had been badly done,\r\nor to cast the blame of it upon others. Attentive to the study of his\r\npart, and to never accept a bad one, La Rochefoucauld says truly that\r\nthe Frondeurs, eagerly pressing forwards the marriage of the Prince de\r\nConti with Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, and seeing it retarded, \"suspected\r\nMadame de Longueville and the Duke de la Rochefoucauld of a design to\r\nbreak it off, for fear that the Prince de Conti should escape from their\r\nhands only to fall into those of Madame de Chevreuse and of the\r\nCoadjutor;\" but he endeavours to give a reason for these suspicions, and\r\nto inform us whether they were well or ill founded. Instead of defending\r\nhimself, and Madame de Longueville, he accuses Conde of having \"adroitly\r\nincreased the suspicions of the Frondeurs against his sister and La\r\nRochefoucauld, firmly believing that so long as they held that belief,\r\nthey would never discover the true cause of the postponement of the\r\nmarriage.\" And what was that true cause? Here it is, according to La\r\nRochefoucauld: it was that the Prince de Conde \"not having as yet\r\neither concluded or broken off his treaty with the Queen, and having\r\nbeen informed that the keeper of the seals--Chateauneuf--was about to be\r\ndismissed, wished to await that event to conclude the marriage, if\r\nCardinal Mazarin were ruined by M. de Chateauneuf, or to break it off\r\nand make through that his court to the Queen, should M. de Chateauneuf\r\nbe driven away by the Cardinal.\"\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of Conde's conduct does not do him great honour, but\r\nit is a very probable one. In the first place, if La Rochefoucauld knew\r\nhow to glide so cleverly over all the ticklish points in which he could\r\nnot appear to advantage, he did not, strictly speaking, tell lies; he\r\nretires rather than attacks, unless hurried away by passion, and he was\r\nnever in a passion with Conde. And, further, the conduct which he\r\nattributes to Conde springs quite naturally out of the false position in\r\nwhich Conde had, by degrees, suffered himself to be placed.\r\n\r\nAltogether, we are persuaded that Conde was then sincere. His sole\r\nerror, and it is that which marked his entire conduct during the Fronde,\r\nwas the not having had, either on this occasion or any other, a fixed\r\nand unalterable object. On the 13th of April the Queen took the seals\r\nfrom Madame de Chevreuse's friend, Chateauneuf, the representative of\r\nthe Fronde in the Cabinet, to give them to the gravest person of his\r\ntime, the first president, Mathieu Mole, a worthy servant of the State,\r\nvery little friendly to the Fronde, and who then was sufficiently\r\nfavourable towards the Prince de Conde. That same day she recalled to\r\nthe Council as Secretary of State the Count de Chavigny, who had been\r\nformerly minister for Foreign Affairs under Richelieu. Formed in the\r\nschool of the great Cardinal, as well as Mazarin, ousted from place,\r\ncrafty and resolute, feeling himself capable of bearing the weight of a\r\nministry, Chavigny had beheld with a sufficiently ominous countenance,\r\nafter the death of their common master, the sudden elevation of a\r\ncolleague who had even begun by being his dependent. Since 1643, vanity\r\nhad turned him aside from the high road of ambition, and he had\r\nentangled himself in the brakes of very complicated intrigues. In 1651,\r\nhe passed as the friend of Conde. It was then only, if we can believe La\r\nRochefoucauld, that Conde declared himself opposed to the marriage of\r\nhis youthful brother with Mademoiselle de Chevreuse; and it was time\r\nthat he opposed it, for that marriage was on the eve of accomplishment.\r\nConti gave proof of the most ardent passion for Mademoiselle de\r\nChevreuse; he paid her a thousand attentions which he hid from his\r\nfriends, and particularly from his sister, for whom he ever professed to\r\nentertain an undivided adoration. He held long conferences with the\r\nMarquis de Laigues and other intimate friends of Mademoiselle de\r\nChevreuse; it was even feared lest he should marry her without the\r\nnecessary dispensations and without the participation of the head of his\r\nfamily. Conde, therefore, decided to act at once, and the reputation of\r\nthe fair lady afforded him a means of attack which he employed with\r\nsuccess upon his brother. He seems to have had no great difficulty in\r\nattaining his object. The Prince de Conti soon received proof that she\r\nwas not by any means so immaculate as he had believed: her scarcely\r\ndoubtful connection with the Coadjutor was placed in its true light,\r\nand, convinced that the object of his passion was unworthy the love of a\r\nman of honour, he began to look upon her with horror. He even blamed\r\nMadame de Longueville and the Duke de la Rochefoucauld for not having\r\nwarned him sooner of what was said of her in society. From that moment\r\nmeans of breaking off the affair without acrimony were sought; but\r\nthe interests involved were too great, and the circumstances too piquant\r\nnot to renew and augment still more the old hatred of Madame de\r\nChevreuse and the Frondeurs against the Prince de Conde, and against\r\nthose whom they suspected of taking part in that which had just been\r\ndone.[2]\r\n\r\n    [2] La Rochefoucauld, p. 69. Retz, tom, ii., p. 223.\r\n\r\nThis testimony would justify Madame de Longueville and La Rochefoucauld\r\nhimself for having urged Conde upon that disloyal and impolitic rupture,\r\nif one could believe it to be entirely sincere; but it is very difficult\r\nto admit that Madame de Longueville and her all-powerful adviser could\r\nhave remained strangers to a determination so important, and there are\r\nmany doubts and obscurities resting upon this delicate point. De Retz,\r\nwhose introspect was so penetrating, and who does not pride himself on\r\nany great reserve in his judgments, knew not what opinion to\r\nform--Conde, Madame de Longueville, and La Rochefoucauld having\r\nafterwards assured him that they had had nothing to do with the rupture\r\nof the marriage.\r\n\r\nBut whose soever was the hand that broke off the projected alliance of\r\nthe Condes with Madame de Chevreuse, it is beyond doubt that that had\r\nlost Conde and saved Mazarin. All the errors which followed were derived\r\nfrom that cardinal one. In it must be discerned the first link of that\r\nchain of disastrous events which ended by dragging Conde into civil war.\r\n\r\nThe resentment of Madame de Chevreuse may well be imagined, when she\r\ndiscovered that she had been tricked, that she had separated herself\r\nfrom Mazarin and the Queen, and had drawn Conde out of prison only to\r\nreceive in exchange such an unpardonable outrage! Already, even a short\r\ntime before, when the Queen ousted Chateauneuf without consulting the\r\nDuke d'Orleans, the wrath of the Frondeurs had been such, that at a\r\ncouncil held at the Palais d'Orleans of the whole party, it was proposed\r\nto go, on the part of the lieutenant-general, and demand back the seals\r\nfrom Mathieu Mole. The most violent expedients were suggested, and some\r\namong the more hot-headed spoke of seizing their arms and descending\r\ninto the streets. Conde, who had not yet entirely broken with the\r\nFrondeurs, and was present at this council with a few of his friends,\r\nthrew cold water upon every proposal that was made, and energetically\r\nopposed the appeal to arms, declaring that he did not understand waging\r\n\"a war of paving-stones and _pots de chambre_,\" and that he felt himself\r\ntoo much of a coward for such a campaign as that.\r\n\r\nAfter some time passed in sharp discussion, the Duke retired into the\r\napartments of his wife with De Retz, and there a brief consultation\r\nensued, in which the Duchess d'Orleans, Madame de Chevreuse, and the\r\nCoadjutor endeavoured to persuade him to arrest the leaders of the\r\nopposite party, and rouse the people to insurrection. The Duke d'Orleans\r\nwas in some degree moved; Conde, Conti, and the Duke de Beaufort and\r\nothers, had retired into the library, and Mademoiselle de Chevreuse,\r\nspringing towards the door, exclaimed, \"Nothing is wanting but a turn of\r\nthe key! It would be a fine thing indeed for a girl to arrest a winner\r\nof battles!\"\r\n\r\nThe impetuosity of Mademoiselle de Chevreuse, however, alarmed the timid\r\nDuke d'Orleans. Had he been brought to it by degrees, he might have\r\nconsented to the act; but her movement towards the door startled him,\r\nand he began to whistle,--which, as De Retz observes, was never a good\r\nsign. Then declaring that he would consider of the matter till the next\r\nmorning, he walked quietly into the library, and suffered the guests to\r\ndepart in peace whom he had been so sorely tempted to make prisoners.\r\n\r\nAt the same time in the parliament all the violent measures taken\r\nagainst Mazarin were renewed: he was banished and rebanished, with\r\nconfiscation of his possessions, and even his books and pictures were\r\nordered to be sold. A decree had already been passed declaring all\r\nforeign cardinals incapable of serving in France, and of entering into\r\nthe ministry. They did not stop there, and certain councillors who were\r\nnot in the secrets of the party, and obeying only their passion,\r\nproposed to exclude from the ministry even the French cardinals as being\r\nstill too dependent upon Rome. This sweeping motion was carried amid\r\nloud cheers, which resounded through all parts of the hall. Whereupon\r\nConde laughingly remarked: \"There's a fine echo.\" That same echo was the\r\nruin of De Retz's hopes, who only so passionately desired to become a\r\ncardinal in order to succeed to Mazarin. Shortly afterwards the division\r\nbetween Conde and the Old Fronde was declared, and Conde applied himself\r\nto form an intermediate party, a new Fronde, which became sufficiently\r\npowerful to disquiet Madame de Chevreuse and the Coadjutor.[3]\r\n\"Imagine,\" says the latter, \"what the royal authority purged of\r\nMazarinism would have been, and the party of the Prince de Conde purged\r\nof faction! More than all, what surety was there in M. the Duke\r\nd'Orleans!\"\r\n\r\n    [3] De Retz, tom, ii., p. 205.\r\n\r\n    [4] The same, p. 214.\r\n\r\nBut De Retz was not the only politician who terrified himself with the\r\nidea of such a future looming thus darkly for France. Mazarin dreaded\r\nit as much as he. His authority was almost universally thought to be for\r\never annihilated; but a small number of courtiers who could read the\r\nQueen's heart, judged otherwise, and owed to the skilful line of conduct\r\nto which they adhered under these circumstances the high fortune to\r\nwhich they attained in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that, in the first instance, Conde might have\r\ncarried off the Regency from the Queen, deprived as she was of her prime\r\nminister, and by her own acknowledgment incapable of governing by\r\nherself; but then the direction of affairs belonged by right to the Duke\r\nd'Orleans, of whom Conde was jealous. Conde, however, preferred to keep\r\nthe Regency in the Queen's hands, and by rendering himself formidable to\r\nthe Government, forcing it to reckon with him. If that union of the\r\nPrinces between themselves and the Fronde faction had subsisted, the\r\nre-establishment of the royal authority would have been impossible: and\r\nthe commencement of the reign of Louis the Fourteenth, who, although he\r\nhad only completed his thirteenth year, was about, by the force of an\r\nexceptional law, to be declared of age, would have offered the\r\nspectacle, so frequent in French annals,[5] of a state a prey to the\r\ndivulsion of factions and the horrors of anarchy.\r\n\r\n    [5] Retz--La Rochefoucauld--Joly.\r\n\r\nBut for the happiness of France and the Queen-Regent, Conde was as\r\nunskilful in politics as he was great in war. He kept none of the\r\npromises he had made to the chiefs of the Fronde, the authors of his\r\ndeliverance. The marriage of the Prince de Conti and Mademoiselle de\r\nChevreuse, which had been the base of the treaty, and involved other\r\nengagements, was, as we have seen, remorselessly broken off. The Queen\r\nRegent, in order to succeed in bringing back her favourite minister to\r\npower, had the tact to conceal his advances, and therefore chose in the\r\nfirst instance to replace him by Chavigny, who was his personal enemy.\r\nThen she negotiated with all parties, and skilfully opposed the Fronde\r\nto the Prince de Conde, the latter to the Duke d'Orleans, the parliament\r\nto the assembly of the nobles, the aversion to Mazarin to the fear which\r\nthe Coadjutor inspired. Her ministers, whom she abused, had only the\r\nsemblance of power; all that was real was possessed by Mazarin. From\r\nBruhl, his place of exile, he governed France; the Queen adopted no\r\nresolution without its having been inspired by him, or met with his\r\napproval. Thus hidden by the Regent's mantle, the Cardinal followed with\r\nvigilant eye the quarrels of the Prince de Conde and the Frondeurs,\r\nfomenting them and inflaming them by every means at his disposal,\r\nprodigalising to Conde promises which must in the highest degree have\r\nalarmed the Fronde, and entangling him daily more and more in the meshes\r\nof intricate, tortuous negotiations, until he had seen the separation,\r\nfor which he manoeuvred, irremediably consummated. Then he stopped,\r\nand began insensibly even to fall back. The placing of Provence in the\r\nPrince de Conti's hands was deferred; and in fact it was held in reserve\r\nfor the Duke de Mercoeur, the eldest son of the Duke de Vendome, who\r\nwas seeking the hand of one of Mazarin's nieces; and it was also found\r\ninexpedient to deprive the Duke de Saint-Simon of Blaye to give it to La\r\nRochefoucauld; and a thousand other difficulties of a like nature were\r\nraised, which both astonished and irritated Conde. Since he broke with\r\nthe Fronde, it was apparently to unite himself with the Queen, and the\r\nhigher his ambition soared, the more necessary it was to cover it with\r\nrespect and deference, in order to hasten and secure the treaty on\r\nfoot, and to enchain the monarchy with his own fate. But the fiery Conde\r\nwas incapable of such a line of conduct. Finding unexpected obstacles\r\nwhere previously he had met with facilities and hopeful anticipations,\r\nhe lost his temper, and resumed the imperious tone which already, in\r\n1649, had embroiled him with the Queen and Mazarin.\r\n\r\nIt appears also that Madame de Longueville shared in the soaring\r\nillusions of her brother, and that she bore but indifferently well her\r\nnewly blown prosperity. Madame de Motteville gives us to understand so\r\nwith her usual moderation, and the Duchess de Nemours rejoices to say so\r\nwith all the acrimony and doubtless also the exaggeration of hatred.[6]\r\nIt must, indeed, be owned, with the heroic instincts of Conde, Madame de\r\nLongueville shared also his haughty spirit. All her contemporaries\r\nascribe to her an innate majesty which did not show itself on ordinary\r\noccasions; far from it, she was simple, amiable, adding thereto, when\r\ndesirous of pleasing, a caressing and irresistible gentleness; but, with\r\npeople whom she disliked, she intrenched herself in a frigid dignity,\r\nand Anne of Austria and she had never loved one another. A misplaced\r\nhaughtiness towards the Queen is attributed to her. One day, says Madame\r\nde Nemours, she kept her waiting for two or three hours. It is very\r\ndoubtful whether Madame de Longueville could have so far forgotten\r\nherself; but it is not impossible that she may have imagined, as well as\r\nher brother, that the fortunes of their house, having emerged more\r\nbrilliant than ever from so rude a tempest, had no longer to dread the\r\nrecurrence of further ill-omened shocks.\r\n\r\n    [6] Madame de Motteville, tom. iv., p. 346; Madame de Nemours,\r\n    p. 106.\r\n\r\nThey deceived themselves: an immense peril was hanging over their heads.\r\n\r\nImmediately that Madame de Chevreuse had seen that the Queen was growing\r\ncolder towards Conde, and did not seem disposed to keep the promises\r\nthat had been made him, her keen-sighted animosity instantly determined\r\nher course of action, and being for ever separated from Conde, she again\r\ndrew towards the Queen with an offer of her services and those of her\r\nentire party against the common enemy. Mazarin, recognising the error he\r\nhad committed in giving himself two enemies at the same time, and that\r\nat that moment the redoubtable individual, the man who at any cost must\r\nbe destroyed, was Conde, very quickly forgot his grudges against Madame\r\nde Chevreuse, and advised the acceptance of her propositions. The Queen,\r\nit appears, was very averse to receive De Retz, or avail herself of his\r\nservices; she detested him almost as much as she did Conde, well knowing\r\nthat they were the two most dangerous enemies of him without whom she\r\ndid not believe that she could really reign. Mazarin exhorted her\r\nhimself to flatter De Retz's ambition, and, marvellously understanding\r\neach other at a distance--almost as well as when in each other's\r\npresence,--they composed and played out in the most perfect manner a\r\ncomedy of which De Retz himself seems to have been the dupe, and of\r\nwhich Conde was very nearly being the victim.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse has already been depicted both in good and evil, in\r\nher natural intelligence, quickness, keen introspection, and political\r\ngenius, in her indomitable courage and audacity, and all that she was\r\ncapable of undertaking in order to attain her objects. It will now be\r\nnecessary to thoroughly understand De Retz's character, in order to\r\nperceive clearly the peril with which Conde was menaced.\r\n\r\nBy nature yet more restless than ambitious, a bad priest, impatient of\r\nhis condition and having long struggled to emancipate himself from it,\r\nPaul de Gondi had prepared himself for cabals by composing or\r\ntranslating the life of a celebrated conspirator. Then, passing quickly\r\nfrom theory to practice, he had entered into one of the most sinister\r\nplots framed against Richelieu, and for his first experiment he had\r\naccepted the task, he, a young abbe, of assassinating the Cardinal at\r\nthe altar during the ceremony of Mademoiselle de Montpensier's baptism.\r\nIn 1643, he had not hesitated to throw himself into the arms of the\r\n_Importants_; but the title of Coadjutor of Paris, which had just been\r\nconferred upon him as a recompense for the virtues and services of his\r\nfather, arrested him. The Fronde seemed created altogether expressly for\r\nhim. He shared the parentage of it along with La Rochefoucauld. In vain\r\nin his Memoirs does he studiedly put forward general considerations:\r\nlike La Rochefoucauld, he was only working for himself, and at least had\r\nthe candour to own it. Compelled to remain in the Church, De Retz\r\ndesired to rise in it as high as possible. He aspired to a cardinal's\r\nhat, and soon obtained it, thanks to his inscrutable manoeuvring; but\r\nhis supreme object was the post of prime minister, and to reach it, he\r\nplayed that double game which he so craftily concerted and so skilfully\r\nplayed out. Seeing that Mazarin and Conde were not heads of a government\r\nwhich would leave to others acting with them any great share of\r\nimportance, he undertook to overthrow them, the one by the other, to\r\ncarve out his way between them by them, and to raise upon their ruin the\r\nDuke d'Orleans, under whose name he would govern. To effect this he\r\nincessantly urged alike the Duke, the parliament, and the people, to\r\ndemand, as the first condition of any reconciliation with the Court,\r\nthe dismissal of Mazarin, and at the same time he, under a mask,\r\nexhibited himself as a benevolent conciliator between royalty and the\r\nFronde, promising the Queen, the indispensable sacrifice accomplished,\r\nto smooth all difficulties, and to bring over to her the Duke d'Orleans\r\nby separating him from Conde. Such was the real mainspring of all De\r\nRetz's movements--even those seemingly the most contrary: first the\r\ncardinalate, then the premiership under the auspices of the Duke\r\nd'Orleans, associated in some sort with royalty, without Mazarin or\r\nConde. He was fain to hide his secret under the guise of the public\r\nweal, but that secret revealed itself by the very efforts he made to\r\nconceal it, and it did not escape the penetration of La Rochefoucauld,\r\nhis accomplice at the outset of the Fronde, afterwards his adversary,\r\nwho had a perfect knowledge of his character, and who had sketched it\r\nwith a masterly hand, as De Retz also thoroughly comprehended and\r\nadmirably depicted La Rochefoucauld. De Retz was indeed the evil genius\r\nof the Fronde. He always hindered it from progressing whether led by\r\nMazarin or Conde, because he merely desired to have a weak government\r\nwhich he could dominate. To arrive at that end, he was capable of\r\nanything--tortuous intrigues, anonymous pamphlets, hypocritical sermons\r\nfrom the pulpit, studied orations in parliament, popular insurrections\r\nand desperate _coups de main_. Such was the man who, towards the end of\r\nMay, 1651, was admitted, much against her will, into the secret councils\r\nof Anne of Austria.\r\n\r\nAnything was to be tried, however, which might deliver her from the\r\nexactions of Conde. It was absolutely necessary that she should either\r\ngrant his demands, or find some support to enable her to resist them.\r\nShe accordingly despatched Marshal du Plessis to speak with De Retz, at\r\nthe archbishopric, towards one o'clock in the morning, at which hour he\r\ngenerally returned from his nocturnal visits to Mademoiselle de\r\nChevreuse. De Retz was willing to seize the opportunity of avenging\r\nhimself upon Conde, and probably judged he might do so without bringing\r\nabout the return of Mazarin. He accepted, then, at once the Queen's\r\ninvitation, and flung the letter of safe-conduct which she had sent him\r\ninto the fire, in order to show his confidence in her promises. The\r\nfollowing night, at twelve o'clock, he was brought into the Queen's\r\nOratory by a back staircase, and a long conversation ensued between\r\nthem. Anne of Austria was very caressing in her manner towards the\r\nCoadjutor, and sought, after winning her way to his confidence, to\r\nembroil him with Chateauneuf, by informing him that it was that friend\r\nof Madame de Chevreuse who was the most opposed to his cardinalate,\r\nbecause he wanted the hat for himself. It must be remembered that France\r\nat that moment had the appointment of a cardinal at its disposition, and\r\nit had been long promised to the Prince de Conti. Anne of Austria now\r\noffered it to De Retz who, in reply, at the end of a long harangue,\r\nduring which the Queen interrupted him impatiently more than once,\r\nassured her that he had not come there to receive favours, but to merit\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"What will you do for me, then?\" asked the Queen. \"What will you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" replied he, \"I will oblige the Prince de Conde to quit Paris\r\nere eight days are over, and will carry off the Duke d'Orleans from him\r\nbefore to-morrow night.\"\r\n\r\nThe Queen, transported with joy, extended her hand to him saying--\"Give\r\nme your hand on that, and the day after to-morrow you are a cardinal,\r\nand moreover the second amongst my friends.\"\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards, De Retz and Madame de Chevreuse had raised the\r\nentire Fronde against the Prince de Conde. The worthy archbishop had\r\nannounced his approach to the enemy he was about to attack by a cloud of\r\nthe same kind of libels, satires, and epigrams, which he had always\r\nfound so efficacious in prejudicing the people of Paris against any one\r\nwhom he thought fit to hold forth to popular odium. At the same time a\r\nmultitude of criers and hawkers were sent through the town, spreading,\r\nat the very lowest price, all the sarcasms which had been composed at\r\nthe archbishopric in the morning, to render the conduct of Conde\r\nridiculous, contemptible, and hateful in the eyes of the multitude.\r\n\r\nAt length, when the Coadjutor believed that everything had been\r\nsufficiently prepared, he made the Palatine write to inform the Queen\r\nthat he was about to go to the parliament. Mademoiselle de Chevreuse was\r\nwith the Regent at the time she received this intimation; and the\r\ndelight which it occasioned was so great that the virtuous and pious\r\nAnne of Austria caught the archbishop's mistress in her arms, and kissed\r\nher more than once, exclaiming, with no very great regard for decorum,\r\n\"You rogue! you are now doing me as much good as you have hitherto done\r\nme harm.\"\r\n\r\nDe Retz kept his word, and went to the parliament, but the progress\r\nagainst Conde was so slow that Mazarin, the Queen, and De Retz, began to\r\nrevolve more summary measures, and, towards the latter part of June,\r\ntheir deliberations ended in a sinister project of again arresting or of\r\nassassinating Conde.\r\n\r\nThis obscure affair, as yet only partially unveiled, and which probably\r\nwill never be so entirely, is not so dark and impenetrable, however, as\r\nto prevent us from seeing, within the shadow thereof, fearful and\r\ncriminal purposes, to which even the more open vices of the age are\r\ncomparatively light. We are told by De Retz that the Marshal de\r\nHocquincourt, with more frankness than the rest, proposed in direct\r\nterms to assassinate Conde. The Coadjutor himself, however, Madame de\r\nChevreuse, and other leaders of the Fronde, but above all Senneterre,\r\nwho had about this time obtained a great share of the Queen's\r\nconfidence, opposed not only the bold crime proposed at first by\r\nHocquincourt, but also all the schemes which he and others afterwards\r\nsuggested, and which, though apparently more mild, were all likely to\r\nend in the same event.\r\n\r\nRumours of what was meditated soon reached the Prince's ears, who then\r\nsaw clearly the nature of his position. He perceived that he had\r\nquarrelled thoroughly and for ever with the Frondeurs and with the\r\nQueen, and that henceforth he was placed between imprisonment and\r\nassassination. He felt certain that this time, should he fall into the\r\nhands of his enemies, he would be treated far more harshly than in 1650,\r\nand that probably he might never see the light again. He despised death,\r\nbut the idea of perpetual incarceration was insupportable to him, and\r\nthat idea fastening itself by degrees on his mind caused projects to\r\nenter into it which until then had only momentarily crossed it.\r\n\r\nToo high-minded to quit Paris as though he were terrified, Conde\r\nexhibited no change in his conduct; merely confining himself to no\r\nlonger visiting the Palais-Royal or the Palais d'Orleans, and never\r\ngoing abroad without a numerous escort of officers and retainers.\r\nAlready for some time past foreseeing the storm that was gathering\r\nagainst him, he had taken serious measures to confront it: he had\r\nstrengthened all the fortresses that were in his hands. He had\r\ndespatched to Flanders the Marquis de Sillery, La Rochefoucauld's\r\nbrother-in-law, under pretext of finally disengaging Madame de\r\nLongueville and Turenne from the treaties they had made with the\r\nSpaniards in 1650, with secret instructions to renew them, and to\r\nascertain how far he might reckon on the assistance of Spain if he were\r\ncompelled to draw the sword. The Count de Fuensaldagne did not fail,\r\nagreeable to the policy of his court, to promise much more than was\r\nasked of him, and he omitted nothing calculated to stir up Conde to have\r\nrecourse to arms.\r\n\r\nChance had a share in urging Conde to take a further and almost decisive\r\nstep in the dangerous path that was opening before him. One evening,\r\njust as he had lain down on his bed and was chatting with Vineuil, one\r\nof his trusty friends, the latter received a note which directed him to\r\nwarn the Prince that two companies of guards were advancing on the side\r\nof the Faubourg Saint-Germain. It was thought that those troops were\r\nabout to invest the hotel. Conde jumped out of bed, dressed himself,\r\nmounted his horse instantly, and, accompanied by a few attendants, took\r\nhis way through the faubourg Saint-Michel. On gaining the high road, he\r\nheard the clatter of a somewhat strong body of horsemen approaching, and\r\nthinking that it was the squadron in search of him, he fell back at\r\nfirst in the direction of Meudon; then, instead of re-entering Paris,\r\nwhen day broke he sought an asylum in his chateau of Saint-Maur. He\r\nreached it on the morning of the 6th of July; and it may readily be\r\nguessed what the effect, in Paris and throughout the kingdom, of such a\r\nretreat was, and for such motives. The Princess de Conde, the Prince de\r\nConti, Madame de Longueville, La Rochefoucauld, the Duke de Nemours,\r\nthe Duke de Richelieu, the Prince's most intimate friends, and more than\r\none illustrious personage, such as the Duke de Bouillon and Turenne,\r\nrepaired immediately to Saint-Maur. In a day or two, Conde saw himself\r\nsurrounded by a court as brilliant and as numerous as that of the King,\r\nand there he kept up a right royal festivity. After a while he sent a\r\nconsiderable number of officers disguised into Paris, who bestirred\r\nthemselves in every quarter in his favour; and when he considered\r\nhimself in a position to hold his own against both the Queen and the\r\nFrondeurs together, he quitted Saint-Maur and returned to his hotel near\r\nthe Palais d'Orleans, desiring to put a good complexion on the aspect of\r\nhis affairs and to impose upon his enemies by that bold and high-minded\r\nconduct.[7] He appeared again also in the parliament, now once more\r\nbecome the battle-field of parties. De Retz, full of his own individual\r\nhatred, augmented by that of Madame de Chevreuse, seconded at once by\r\nthe friends of the Duke d'Orleans and by those of the Queen, burning to\r\ntear from the Court and win, by serving it, the cardinal's hat, the\r\nobject of his ardent desires, the necessary stepping-stone to his\r\nambition, brought all his courage and vanity towards enacting the part\r\nof the Prince's enemy. And there, during the months of July and August,\r\nin that pretended sanctuary of law and justice, passed all those\r\ndeplorable scenes which De Retz and La Rochefoucauld have related, and\r\nin which Mazarin, from his retreat on the banks of the Rhine, rejoiced\r\nto see his two enemies waste their strength, and work unwittingly but\r\nsurely their common ruin and his approaching triumph.\r\n\r\n    [7] La Rochefoucauld, p. 83.\r\n\r\nA crisis was clearly inevitable. Conde could no longer perceive any\r\nsign of a pacific issue from the position in which he had been placed,\r\nor rather in which he had placed himself, and at his right hand stood\r\nMadame de Longueville and the Prince de Conti, who held no opinions\r\ncontrary to those of his sister, urging him to cut the knot which he\r\nknew not how to untie. La Rochefoucauld stopped him for a moment on the\r\nthreshold of war, entreating Conde to allow him to undertake fresh\r\nnegotiations. The Prince consented willingly thereto. Madame de\r\nLongueville was opposed to it. La Rochefoucauld, speaking to her with\r\nthat authority which his long devotion gave him, represented to her the\r\nterrible responsibility which she took upon herself both towards Conde\r\nand the State, and he obtained from her a promise that she would\r\nwithdraw for a time from the arena of strife, and accompany her\r\nsister-in-law, the Princess de Conde, to Berri, and allow him to remain\r\nin Paris by the side of Conde in order to make a last essay towards\r\nconjuring the tempest.\r\n\r\nThe fitting moment has now arrived to examine the conduct of Madame de\r\nLongueville in these grave conjunctures, the different feelings which\r\nanimated her, and the true and lamentable motive which determined her\r\nthus to hurry her brother into civil war, and herself with him.\r\n\r\nLet us remember:--Anne de Bourbon exhibited extraordinary contrasts in\r\nher character, entirely opposite qualities which, developing themselves\r\nin turn according to circumstances, gave a particular impress to\r\ndifferent periods of her life. She derived from nature and the Christian\r\neducation she had received a delicate and susceptible conscience, a\r\nhumility in her own eyes and before God that would have made her an\r\naccomplished Carmelite; and at the same time she was born with that\r\nardour of soul which is termed ambition, the instinct of glory and of\r\ngrandeur. This instinct, which was also that of her house and her age,\r\nsoon obtained the mastery on emerging from her pious adolescence, and\r\nwhen she despaired of overcoming her father's resistance to the serious\r\ndesire she had manifested of burying herself, at fifteen, in the convent\r\nof the Rue St. Jacques, with her already formidable beauty and the\r\nnascent desire to shine and to please. That desire was at once Madame de\r\nLongueville's strength and weakness, the principle of her coquetry amid\r\nthe amusements of peace, as of her intrepidity in the midst of war and\r\ndanger. Once condemned to live in the world, she transferred the dreams\r\nof glory which she dared not realise for herself, to gild her brother's\r\nwreath of laurel,--that Louis de Bourbon, almost of the same age as\r\nherself, the cherished companion of her infancy, so witty, so generous,\r\nso bold, that he was at once a friend and a master, and the idol of her\r\nheart, before another object had usurped the place or after he had\r\nabandoned it. In the first and the last portion of her life, which are\r\nincomparably the best, she referred everything to Conde, and Conde had a\r\nconfidence in her altogether boundless. The suspicious and penetrating\r\nMazarin had very early formed that opinion of her, and in the _carnets_,\r\nto which he has confided his very inmost feelings, he depicts her with\r\nthe pen of an enemy, but of an enemy who knew her well. \"Madame de\r\nLongueville,\" says he, \"has entire power over her brother. She desires\r\nto see Conde dominate and dispose of all favours. If she is prone to\r\ngallantry, it is by no means that she thinks of doing wrong, but in\r\norder to make friends and servitors for her brother. She insinuates\r\nambitious ideas into his mind to which he is already only too much\r\ninclined.\" If, in 1648, she became violently enraged against her\r\nbrother, it was that, fascinated and misled by La Rochefoucauld, she\r\nthought that Conde, by serving the Court and Mazarin, was false to his\r\nown fame. In 1649, she had only too far contributed to make him enter by\r\ndegrees upon that fatal path into which La Rochefoucauld had lured\r\nherself. Here, pride nourished the hope of one day seeing the Condes\r\nreplace the D'Orleans. When, in 1850, a son was born to Gaston, the\r\nlittle Duke de Valois, who did not live, she fretted at an event which\r\nthreatened to strengthen and perpetuate a house for which she had no\r\naffection, and in a letter which has remained inedited up to the present\r\nday, she allows the thoughts that had insinuated themselves into her\r\nheart to appear. \"I think,\" she writes to Lenet on the 22nd August,\r\n1650, \"that the news of the birth of M. d'Orleans' son will no more\r\nrejoice my sister-in-law than it has delighted me. It is to my nephew\r\nthat we must offer our condolence.\" In 1651, that ambition was carried\r\nto its highest pitch. Madame de Longueville experienced the natural\r\nintoxication that the power and prosperity of her house was calculated\r\nto give her; and when we think of what perils she had just surmounted,\r\nby what homage she was surrounded on all sides, that she was then\r\nthirty-two, that she was in all the splendour of her beauty, and also\r\nunder all the strength of her passions, we might well be disposed to\r\npardon her that fugitive intoxication, if it had not likewise drawn down\r\ndisastrous consequences upon herself, upon Conde, and upon her country.\r\n\r\nAnd here again occurs the question we have just raised. Was it Madame de\r\nLongueville who caused the rupture of the projected marriage between the\r\nPrince de Conti and Mademoiselle de Chevreuse? If hers was the chief\r\nfault, we look upon it with regret, that in the eye of posterity she\r\nshould bear the blame of such a fault. If she only yielded to the advice\r\nof La Rochefoucauld, we have the more excuse for her, and assert that\r\nthe fault comes home to him. As we have seen, that affair is still\r\ninvolved in much obscurity, and since De Retz himself hesitates, we\r\nought to feel well justified to hesitate in our turn. But it must be\r\nconfessed, the suspicions of the Frondeurs and the accusations of the\r\nQueen's friends have such great weight that it is scarcely possible to\r\navoid attributing to Madame de Longueville a sufficiently large share in\r\nthe deplorable rupture whence so many evils sprang. Her complaisant\r\nbiographer, Villefore, is on this point in accordance with Madame de\r\nMotteville. Without doubt the marriage of the Prince de Conti with\r\nMademoiselle de Chevreuse was far from meeting with universal approval.\r\nThe prudes of the Hotel de Rambouillet, and Mademoiselle de Scuderi in\r\nparticular, protested strongly against such an alliance. The old outrage\r\nwas remembered which, in 1643, Madame de Montbazon, aided by Madame de\r\nChevreuse, had dared to perpetrate upon Madame de Longueville; the\r\naudacious manners of the mother also, which seemed to have been\r\ninherited by the daughter; the equivocal reputation of the latter, the\r\nsuspected and almost public _liaison_ which she carried on with De Retz.\r\nVain objections!--which Madame de Longueville could not allege, for she\r\nperfectly well knew all that when at Stenay she had authorised the\r\nPalatine to pledge her word for hers. Other reasons for her conduct must\r\ntherefore be sought, and the reasons can only be those which her enemies\r\nhave given, and in the foremost place the jealousy of influence, the\r\ndesire of retaining over her younger brother, the Prince de Conti, an\r\nempire that Charlotte de Lorraine would, infallibly, have deprived her.\r\n\r\nThat irreparable error, in bringing about the perilous position in which\r\nConde speedily found himself, necessarily led Madame de Longueville to\r\nthe commission of another error, in some sort compulsory, and which was\r\nthe complement of the first; it is certain that more than anyone else\r\nshe incited her brother to take the resolution he ultimately determined\r\nupon adopting. La Rochefoucauld says so, and all contemporary writers\r\nrepeat the same. We will merely make this essential remark: Madame de\r\nLongueville had at first very readily entered into the reconciliatory\r\nplans of Conde and La Rochefoucauld, and into their negotiations with\r\nthe Court; it was only when those designs had failed, when towards the\r\nmonth of June negotiation had given place to violence, when she saw her\r\nbrother surrounded by assassins, liable at any moment to fall under the\r\nblows of Hocquincourt, or to be flung again into the dungeons of\r\nVincennes, it was then that trembling with fear and indignation, and ill\r\nas she was in health, she rushed to Saint-Maur; and that, finding there\r\nthe flower of the aristocracy and the army assembled, she felt her\r\nwarlike ardour of 1649 and 1650 rekindle. She thought that nothing could\r\nresist on the field of battle the victor of Rocroy and Lens, seconded by\r\nTurenne, who at Stenay had shown such a lively and tender attachment for\r\nher, and the sentiment of which she had never ceased to treat with all\r\nthe exquisite tact of which she was capable. She had also great\r\nconfidence in Spain, which was at her feet, and lavished upon her every\r\nkind of deference. She urged, therefore, Conde to fling further\r\nperfidious and useless negotiations to the winds, and to appeal to the\r\nfortune of arms.\r\n\r\nBut to these different motives, the force of which Madame de Longueville\r\nsummed up the value with the authority of her intelligence and\r\nexperience, was joined another still more potent over her heart, and\r\nwhich had been the original mainspring of her resolutions and conduct.\r\nLa Rochefoucauld alone has no right to impute it to her as a crime. For\r\nourselves, we do not hesitate to make it known upon the evidence of\r\nirrefragable testimony; for we are not composing a panegyric of Madame\r\nde Longueville, but narrating certain passages of her life, in which\r\nthat of the seventeenth century, with its grandeurs and its miseries, is\r\nso completely identified; and if we feel a sincere admiration for the\r\nsister of the great Conde, that admiration does not close our eyes to\r\nher errors. It is not unseemly to admire a heroine whose lofty qualities\r\nare mingled with weaknesses which remind us of her sex. It is, moreover,\r\nthe first duty of history, such as we understand it, and desire to have\r\nit understood, not to stop at the surface of events, but to seek for\r\ntheir causes in the depths of the soul, in human passions and their\r\ninevitable consequences.\r\n\r\nAs has been already said, Madame de Longueville did not love her\r\nhusband. Not only was he greatly her senior, but there was nothing about\r\nhim that responded to the ideal which that illustrious disciple of the\r\nHotel de Rambouillet had formed for herself, and which she pursued in\r\nvain through guilty illusions, until that which she sought and found at\r\nits very source--no longer in the school of Corneille and of\r\nMademoiselle de Scuderi, but in that of her Saviour, in the Carmelite\r\nconvent and at Port Royal. Never was woman less prone to gallantry by\r\nnature than Anne de Bourbon; but, as we have just remarked, her heart\r\nand her imagination created in her the necessity of pleasing and of\r\nbeing beloved; and it was that want, early cultivated by poetry,\r\nromances, and the theatre, and somewhat later corrupted by the example\r\nof the society in which she lived, which lured her far from the domestic\r\nhearth, and hurried her into the brilliant and adventurous career amidst\r\nwhich we find her in 1651. Then her greatest fear was to fall again into\r\nher husband's hands. M. de Longueville had very willingly followed his\r\nwife in the Fronde; his own discontentments of themselves drove him into\r\nit, as well as his uncertain and mobile character which led him to\r\nembark in novel enterprises with as much facility as it urged him to\r\nabandon them. In 1649 he had figured as one of the generals of Paris,\r\nand had raised Normandy against Mazarin. One year of imprisonment had\r\ncooled him, and in 1651, having recovered his government of Normandy and\r\ntasted some few months of that peaceful grandeur, he found it so much to\r\nhis liking as to be not readily tempted to re-embark upon a stormy\r\ncourse of life at the age of nearly fifty-seven. Reports, only too true,\r\nhad informed him of what until then he had only surmised\r\nimperfectly--the declared _liaison_ of his wife with La Rochefoucauld.\r\nHe had been greatly irritated at it, and Conde's enemies, with De Retz\r\nat their head, carefully fostered his ill humour, and his daughter,\r\nMarie d'Orleans, afterwards Duchess de Nemours, seconded them to the\r\nutmost of her power.\r\n\r\nShe detested her stepmother, whose faults her strong common-sense led\r\nher easily to scan, without her own vulgar and commonplace mind being\r\ncapable of comprehending the Duchess's great qualities. It was\r\nimpossible less to resemble each other. The one adored grandeur even to\r\nthe romantic and the chimerical, the other was entirely positive and\r\nmatter-of-fact, and absorbed with her own interest, especially in those\r\nrelating to her property. Alienated from the Fronde through the jealous\r\nhatred she bore towards her stepmother, who in turn liked her almost as\r\nlittle, and probably also did not take pains enough to manage her,\r\nMademoiselle turned towards the Queen, and strove to gain over her\r\nfather to the same party. Therein she succeeded by degrees. The Duke de\r\nLongueville could not overtly separate himself from Conde, and at first\r\npromised him all he required; then he shut himself up in Normandy, and\r\nthere followed a dubious line of conduct which neither compromised him\r\nwith the Court party nor that of Conde. But he recalled his wife\r\nperemptorily, and sent her a mandate to rejoin him. That mandate was\r\npressing and threatening, and it terrified Madame de Longueville. She\r\nknew that her husband had been informed of everything, and that he was\r\nwholly given up to the influence of his daughter. She feared\r\nill-treatment; she felt certain at least that once in Normandy she would\r\nno more quit it, and that her time would be passed between an aged,\r\nirritated husband, and an overruling step-daughter, who would apply\r\nthemselves in concert to retain her in the solitude of a province, and\r\nperhaps to make her expiate in confinement her bygone triumphs. The idea\r\nof the sorrowful life which awaited her in Normandy produced very nearly\r\nthe same effect upon her as the thought of a second imprisonment upon\r\nthe mind of Conde. She sought for a means of avoiding that which was to\r\nher the worst of all evils; there was an assured though dangerous\r\none--war, which would prevent her from repairing to Normandy, under the\r\npretext more or less specious that she could not abandon her brother.\r\nSuch was the design she formed within herself and very soon resolved\r\nupon adopting, and the fresh negotiations which La Rochefoucauld\r\nproposed thwarted her doubly. Should those negotiations prove successful\r\nthey would deprive her of the only pretext she had for not rejoining\r\nher husband in Normandy, and she thought it strange that it was La\r\nRochefoucauld who would expose her to that peril. From that moment\r\ndoubtless angry explanations took place between them. She perceived that\r\nLa Rochefoucauld was wearied of his sacrifices, that he wished to\r\nreconcile himself with the Court, repair his fortunes, and taste the\r\nsweets of peace; whilst in the eyes of the superb princess the paramount\r\nconsideration with him, for whom she had done so much, ought to have\r\nbeen never to forsake her, should they both together rush to certain\r\nruin. But La Rochefoucauld was no longer wound up to a tone so lofty,\r\nworthy of the Great Cyrus and of their chivalrous love of 1648, and the\r\nhaughty Madame[8] was deeply wounded at the discovery. Nevertheless, she\r\nwas not insensible to what there was of reasonable in La Rochefoucauld's\r\nadvice, and not to incur the entire responsibility of the part which her\r\nbrother might take, she consented to follow her sister-in-law, the\r\nPrincess de Conde, and her nephew, the Duke d'Enghien, into Berri, one\r\nof Conde's governments:--a journey which moreover had the advantage of\r\nseparating her from her husband. She set out, therefore, on the 18th of\r\nJuly for Bourges, taking with her the elder of her two sons, the\r\nyounger, Charles de Paris, born in 1649, not being able to bear the\r\nfatigue of the journey. M. de Longueville recalled her from Berri as he\r\nhad from the capital, and he insisted on the return of his son in terms\r\nso forcible that she was compelled to comply, so far as the boy was\r\nconcerned. Thenceforward, being alone and exposing only herself, without\r\nbreaking with M. de Longueville, and by using all her wit to colour her\r\ndisobedience, she eluded his orders, remained in Berri, forming in the\r\ndepth of her heart the most ardent desire for war, but calm in\r\nappearance; sometimes accompanying the Princess de Conde to Montrond, at\r\nothers making somewhat lengthened visits to the Carmelite convent at\r\nBourges. And thus she awaited the issue of the negotiations, counselled\r\nand carried on by La Rochefoucauld, which should decide her destiny.\r\n\r\n    [8] The name she figures under in the _Grand Cyrus_.\r\n\r\nLa Rochefoucauld must indeed have very earnestly longed to bring to a\r\nclose the life of fatigue and danger which he had for three years led,\r\nto have been able to cherish any illusion as to the success of the steps\r\nhe was about again to take. Where was the hope of regaining the Fronde\r\nwhich had just been outrageously deceived, after it had given itself to\r\nthe Prince de Conde in his misfortune, and had extricated him from it?\r\nIf La Rochefoucauld thought that the alliance of the Fronde was\r\nnecessary, he ought to have set about it sooner and at the proper time,\r\npersuaded Conde and his sister to keep their word, and sealed the\r\nalliance agreed upon between the Prince de Conti and Mademoiselle de\r\nChevreuse. He had not done so; and now that he had allowed a treacherous\r\nwar to spring up between Conde and the Fronde, by what charm did he\r\nthink he could suspend it? With the Queen also all negotiation was\r\nexhausted and superfluous. An understanding should have been come to\r\nwith her when she was so disposed, when Conde was all-powerful, when he\r\ncould either have more readily abased or exalted the Crown: _Tum decuit\r\ncum sceptra dabas_. But at the end of August, Conde, embroiled with the\r\nCourt and with the Fronde, had nothing left save his sword. That was\r\nsufficient, doubtless, to make everybody tremble, but was it enough to\r\ninspire confidence in anyone? La Rochefoucauld obtained, therefore, on\r\nall sides to his advances only very vague responses. The time for\r\nnegotiation was passed irrevocably, and whilst La Rochefoucauld\r\nexhausted himself in useless efforts, the Queen and the Fronde concluded\r\na treaty together, with the common design of overwhelming Conde.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was the work of Mazarin, the masterpiece of his political\r\nskill. It authorised the Frondeurs to speak against the Cardinal in\r\nparliament for some time forward in order to cover their secret\r\nunderstanding. The hat was assured to the Coadjutor, high posts and\r\ngreat advantages to the principal friends of Madame de Chevreuse, the\r\nfirst rank in the cabinet given to Chateauneuf, and a solid peace\r\nestablished between Mazarin and the powerful Duchess, under the\r\ncondition that his nephew Mancini, provided for with the duchy of Nevers\r\nor that of Rethelois, should marry Mademoiselle de Chevreuse. The draft\r\nof this projected treaty fell into the hands of Conde through the bearer\r\nof the paquet in which it was enclosed being in the service of the\r\nMarquis de Noirmoutier, and the Prince caused it to be printed in order\r\nto ventilate and bring to light the alliance between the Frondeurs, the\r\nQueen, and Mazarin. Madame de Motteville, so well informed of everything\r\nrelating to the Queen and the Cardinal, considers that treaty as\r\nperfectly authentic, and she gives the different articles of it, \"as the\r\nbest means for understanding the changes which were made by the Queen\r\nimmediately after the King's majority.\"\r\n\r\nThat majority had been declared on the 7th of September in a _Bed of\r\nJustice_, with all the customary pomp. As the first Prince of the blood\r\ndid not think it possible to be present at it in safety, during that\r\nevening the Queen in her indignation had whispered these significant\r\nwords to De Retz: \"Either M. le Prince or I must perish.\"[9]\r\n\r\n    [9] Retz, tom. ii. p. 291.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  CONDE, URGED BY HIS SISTER, GOES UNWILLINGLY INTO REBELLION.\r\n\r\n\r\nANNE OF AUSTRIA now seriously prepared to make head against Conde, and\r\nwith that intent she rallied round her all the forces of the Fronde\r\nunited with those of the royal army. In fine, with the firm design of\r\ninspiring the Fronde with perfect confidence, at the same time that the\r\nnomination of France to the Cardinalate had devolved upon the Coadjutor,\r\nthe Queen again brought into the cabinet, as a sort of Prime Minister,\r\nthe statesman of the party, the friend and instrument of Madame de\r\nChevreuse, the aged but ambitious Chateauneuf, with the two-fold\r\nengagement to serve Mazarin in secret and to contribute to the utmost of\r\nhis power to destroy Conde. In such arrangements, let it be thoroughly\r\nunderstood, no one was acting with good faith: De Retz and Chateauneuf\r\nin nowise proposed to re-establish Mazarin; Chateauneuf did not dream of\r\nmaking another man's bed, but, once having attained power, he intended\r\nto keep it for himself, and Mazarin was firmly resolved to dismiss\r\nChateauneuf as soon as he could. But if these crafty politicians were\r\nready to betray one another in everything else, there was one point on\r\nwhich they were sincerely united--the destruction of Conde. At that they\r\nlaboured in concert, or rather vied with each other. Queen Anne\r\nmanifested therein a fervour, a constancy, a marvellous skill, and\r\nsucceeded in carrying off from Conde the chief supports of his great\r\nstrength. He saw that war was inevitable, and yet, says Sismondi, he\r\nonly yielded to it with repugnance. \"You will have it so,\" said Conde at\r\nlast; \"but understand that if I do draw the sword, I shall be the last\r\nto return it to the scabbard.\" It was the women especially who hurried\r\ntheir admirers into the _melee_.\r\n\r\nConsidering the nomination of the New Cabinet, with Chateauneuf at its\r\nhead, as a veritable declaration of war, Conde went to Chantilly, and,\r\nit is said, had a very narrow escape from falling into an ambuscade\r\nwhich the Court had prepared for him at Pontoise.\r\n\r\nHe remained for some few days at Chantilly, pensive and agitated in\r\npresence of the great resolution he was on the eve of taking. The\r\nmediation of the Duke d'Orleans, the only one he could accept, offered\r\nno security, the Duke instead of governing the Coadjutor and Madame de\r\nChevreuse, was then governed by them. His individual inclination was to\r\ncome to an understanding with the Queen and even with Mazarin, as he had\r\nvery clearly shown. He had continually returned to it; but after so many\r\nlying words and odious plots, the execution of which alone was wanting,\r\nhe thought he would be in a better position to treat solidly with the\r\nCourt at the head of a powerful and victorious army, than in the midst\r\nof wretched intrigues, unworthy of his character, in which he\r\nmomentarily staked his honour and his life. He never permitted the idea\r\nof raising himself above royalty to enter into his mind; he merely\r\nthought that to obtain better conditions from it it was necessary to\r\nrender himself imposing to it, and to make himself feared. That is what\r\nwas then passing in his mind. Civil war inspired him with horror, and we\r\nmay learn from La Rochefoucauld,[1] who was then in his most intimate\r\nconfidence, that he long weighed \"the consequences of so grave a\r\ndetermination.\" Let us be chary, therefore, of accusing Conde of levity;\r\nlet us recognise that insensibly his position had become such that he\r\ncould neither remain in it nor quit it, in one way or another, save with\r\nequal danger.\r\n\r\n    [1] La Rochefoucauld, p. 76.\r\n\r\nAmong the different motives which rendered Conde averse to civil war,\r\nthe passion that he had just begun to feel for the Duchess de Chatillon\r\nmust not be forgotten. We shall return a little further on to this\r\nepisode in Conde's life. It is sufficient to remark here that it was\r\ngrievous to him to quit the lovely Duchess, who then was residing very\r\nclose to Chantilly, in the charming chateau of Merlon or Mello, near\r\nPontoise, the enjoyment of which had been granted to her for life by the\r\nold Princess de Conde, Charlotte Marguerite de Montmorency, who expired\r\nin her arms at Chatillon-sur-Loing, in December, 1650--a gracious grant,\r\nwhich the Prince, her son, had hastened to ratify with a somewhat\r\ninterested generosity. Madame de Chatillon had her reasons of more than\r\none kind for being opposed to the war, and in the intimate counsels of\r\nthe Prince she urged him to an understanding with the Court. In that she\r\nmade common cause with La Rochefoucauld, and was in open quarrel with\r\nMadame de Longueville. Sensible of Conde's passion without sharing it,\r\nshe managed that lofty lover with infinite tact, at the same time that\r\nshe was deeply enamoured of the young, handsome, and brave Duke Charles\r\nAmadeus of Savoy, Nemours,[2] who from his youth and adventurous\r\ninstincts would have longed for war, and whom she alone, seconded by La\r\nRochefoucauld, retained in the party of peace.\r\n\r\n    [2] Charles Amadeus had succeeded to the title and rank of his elder\r\n    brother, the Duke de Nemours, one of Conde's intimate friends in\r\n    youth, who had been killed early in action, even before Rocroy.\r\n    Conde had transferred to Charles Amadeus the affection which he bore\r\n    his brother. The young duke had married the beautiful Madlle. de\r\n    Vendome, daughter of Duke Caesar, and sister of the Dukes de\r\n    Mercoeur and Beaufort, and by her he had two daughters who became,\r\n    one the Queen of Portugal, the other the Duchess of Savoy. At the\r\n    death of the Duke de Nemours, in 1652, his title passed to his\r\n    younger brother Henri de Nemours, Archbishop of Rheims, who then\r\n    quitted the church, and espoused Madlle. de Longueville, the\r\n    authoress of the Memoirs.\r\n\r\nEverything, however, tended to precipitate Conde towards the fatal\r\nresolution. Prudence did not permit him to remain any longer at\r\nChantilly,[3] and it behoved him to place himself beyond the risk of a\r\n_coup-de-main_ by withdrawing to his government of Berri, whither he had\r\nalready sent his son, his wife, and his sister. It was, it is true, the\r\nroad to Guienne, but he might stop there. All the population was devoted\r\nto him, and the tower of Bourges and the strong fortalice of Montrond\r\noffered him a safe asylum.\r\n\r\n    [3] La Rochefoucauld, p. 96.\r\n\r\nConde, even after reaching Berri, still hesitated, not wishing to take\r\nany step before again conferring with his sister, who was then at\r\nMontrond with the Princess. There he held a final council, a supreme\r\ndeliberation, at which Madame de Longueville, Conti, and La\r\nRochefoucauld were present. More than one grave motive urged him to war:\r\nthe well-founded dread of assassination or of a fresh incarceration, the\r\nardent hatred of his enemies, of the Queen and the Fronde, the power of\r\nChateauneuf which certainly had not been given him in vain, the\r\ninutility of negotiations with people who seemed decidedly to have taken\r\ntheir choice, the necessity of avoiding the fate of Henri de Guise, the\r\nconsciousness of his strength so soon as his foot should tread the\r\nfield of battle, the promises seemingly so sure of the Bouillons and\r\nmany others. At the same time, his good sense, his loyalty, the scarcely\r\nstifled instincts of duty, and his innate aversion for anything which\r\nresembled anarchy, restrained him; and in that prolonged and dubious\r\nstruggle between conflicting feelings, there were others which hurried\r\nhim onward. Madame de Longueville, the Prince de Conti, La Rochefoucauld\r\nalso urged him to declare himself against the Court, and Madame de\r\nLongueville with more vivacity than anyone else.[4] Conde still\r\nresisted, explaining to them all the strength of royalty, the ascendancy\r\nof the King's name, the weakness and treachery of factions, the bad\r\nfaith of Spain. Then concluding by yielding, he addressed them in these\r\nmemorable words: \"You commit me to a strange line of action, of which\r\nyou will tire sooner than I, and in which you will abandon me.\" He spoke\r\ntruly as regarded Conti, and perhaps also La Rochefoucauld; but it\r\nremains to be seen whether Madame de Longueville, after having helped to\r\ndrive her heroic brother into civil war, did not follow him with an\r\ninviolable constancy, whether she did not share, even to extremity, the\r\ndangers and adversities of the Prince, and whether, during his long\r\nexile, she reappeared for a single moment at Court or in those _salons_\r\nof the Louvre and the Palais Royal, which had witnessed her early\r\nsuccesses, and in which her wit and beauty still promised her fresh\r\ntriumphs.\r\n\r\n    [4] Mad. de Motteville.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE COQUETS WITH THE DUKE DE NEMOURS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIS determination to unsheath the sword once taken, Conde put his plans\r\ninto execution without throwing one glance behind him. Having collected\r\ntogether in Berri his family and chief supporters, he distributed\r\namongst them the several parts they had to play in their common\r\nenterprise. After this, accompanied by La Rochefoucauld, he went to take\r\npossession of his new government of Guienne, and there raise the\r\nstandard of insurrection, leaving in Berri his wife and son, his sister,\r\nthe Prince de Conti, the Duke de Nemours, with the President Viole and\r\nothers whom he nominated to important functions. He had placed his\r\nbrother at the head of affairs there, and given the military command to\r\nthe Duke de Nemours. But the result of these arrangements was\r\ndisappointing to him. The Duke de Nemours undoubtedly possessed the most\r\nbrilliant courage, but he had neither the talents nor the steadiness of\r\na general. Still absorbed with his passion for Madame de Chatillon, who,\r\nas has been said, had long retained him in the party of peace, he found\r\nin Berri a counter-attraction in Madame de Longueville who drew him\r\ntowards that of war; and it would seem that he occupied himself more\r\nwith paying court to the lovely lady than of raising and arming soldiers\r\nand making Berri a focus of resistance, both political and military;\r\nfor very speedily the Prince de Conti and he were reduced to defend\r\nthemselves in Bourges instead of being able to operate in the open and\r\nmake any advance. The new Minister Chateauneuf showed himself worthy of\r\nthe confidence of Madame de Chevreuse and the Fronde. He made the Queen\r\nunderstand that it was necessary to combat the revolt foot to foot from\r\nits very first step, and he persuaded her to march herself with the\r\nyoung King into Berri at the head of a strong army. He nobly inaugurated\r\nthe new ministry by that measure, which had two objects: the one direct\r\nand immediate, to strangle the insurrection at its birth; the other\r\nstill more important, to set royalty at liberty far from Duke Gaston and\r\nthe Parliament. The city of Bourges, which had shown so much enthusiasm\r\non Conde's arrival, opened its gates to the King and Chateauneuf. The\r\nstrong tower which defended the city, offering no resistance, was taken\r\nwithout a blow being struck, and instantly demolished. The Princess de\r\nConde, her son, Madame de Longueville, Conti, and Nemours were forced to\r\ntake refuge hastily in the citadel of Montrond. On learning that Palluan\r\nwas advancing on that fortress, Conti and Nemours not wishing that the\r\nprecious pledges confided to their charge should incur any risk, left\r\nthe Marquis de Persan in Montrond, and with what remained to them of\r\ntheir faithful troops escorted the Princess, her son, and Madame de\r\nLongueville as far as Guienne, which they reached by the end of the\r\nmonth of October.\r\n\r\nIt was during that rapid journey and their very brief sojourn in Berri\r\nthat certain obscure relations, it would appear, were formed between the\r\nDuke de Nemours and Madame de Longueville, the report of which reaching\r\nBordeaux, exaggerated probably by interested and malevolent underlings,\r\nwounded La Rochefoucauld and drove him to a violent rupture. A loyal and\r\nconfiding explanation might have sufficed to disperse a cloud, such as\r\nat times will obscure the most settled friendships. La Rochefoucauld\r\nbrewed a storm out of it which, thanks to his Memoirs, has sent its\r\nechoes down to posterity. His separation from Madame de Longueville was\r\nmarked by an eagerness which excites the suspicion that he had longed\r\nfor it.[1] He ought at least to have stopped there, but hurried away by\r\nan implacable resentment, he accused her, or caused her to be accused by\r\nConde, of having wished to betray his interests to serve those of the\r\nDuke de Nemours, giving her even to understand that \"if a like\r\nprepossession took her for another, she was capable of going to the same\r\nextremities if that person desired it.\"[2] The accusation is yet more\r\nabsurd than odious. The Duke de Nemours was not the least in the world a\r\nparty chief; he was a friend of Conde, whose fidelity could only be\r\nshaken through his love for Madame de Chatillon. To detach him from\r\nMadame de Chatillon was therefore to give him wholly to Conde. Moreover,\r\nMadame de Chatillon, like La Rochefoucauld, was for peace, she had won\r\nover the Duke de Nemours to it, and both together urged Conde thereto.\r\nTo carry off the Duke de Nemours from such conspiracy and to seduce him\r\nto the war party, was to serve the interests of Conde like as his sister\r\nintended. Thus the principal and the dominant motive of Madame de\r\nLongueville's conduct was just the opposite of that which La\r\nRochefoucauld imputed to her. Let us add further that she had always had\r\na rivalry of beauty with Madame de Chatillon, and that her vanity was\r\nnot sorry to humiliate a rival whom she did not tolerate by depriving\r\nher for a few days of a lover of whose attachment the latter fancied\r\nherself perfectly secure. Love and the senses had nothing to do with it\r\nin this matter. The gratification of the senses, it has already been\r\nremarked, did not ensnare her; she was proof against their surprises.\r\nPreviously the Duke de Nemours had addressed his ardent homage to her,\r\nbut all the attractions of his handsome person and his lofty bearing had\r\nmade no impression upon her, and she only bestowed a thought on the\r\namiable Duke when she had some interest to forward by reviving such\r\nconquest. And this is not an opinion hazarded at a venture; it is\r\nfurnished us by a person thoroughly well informed, and who had no\r\naffection for Madame de Longueville; the testimony therefore is the more\r\nvaluable: \"M. de Nemours[3] previously had not much pleased her, and\r\nnotwithstanding the attachment he appeared to entertain for her, as well\r\nas all the good qualities and grand airs of which he could boast, she\r\nhad found nothing charming about him save the pleasure he showed himself\r\ndesirous of giving her by abandoning Madame de Chatillon for herself,\r\nand that which she had of depriving a woman whom she did not like of a\r\nfriend of so much consequence.\" Now how far had this _liaison_ of a few\r\ndays gone? Bussy is the only contemporary who offers any reply to this\r\nquestion in the cynical light of his _Histoire amoreuse des Gaules_. But\r\nwho would accept that satire literally? It proves only one thing, the\r\nunfortunate notoriety which the imprudence of Madame de Longueville\r\nderived from the Memoirs of La Rochefoucauld published in 1662. Before\r\nthose Memoirs saw the light, not a word is anywhere to be found on a\r\npoint as obscure as it is delicate. After, Bussy was delighted to repeat\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, and Madame de Longueville has thus fallen into the\r\nscandalous chronicle.\r\n\r\n    [1] \"La Rochefoucauld, depuis assez longtemps ayant envie de la\r\n    quitter, prit cette occasion avec joie.\"--Mad. de Nemours, p. 150.\r\n\r\n    [2] La Rochefoucauld, edition 1662, p. 198.\r\n\r\n    [3] Mad. de Nemours, pp. 149, 150.\r\n\r\nLet us abstain from defending her; although even we should be convinced\r\nthat she knew where to stop in that dangerous game of coquetry, she is\r\nnot the less culpable in our eyes both towards La Rochefoucauld and\r\nherself, and we do not hesitate to say that she went so far as to\r\ndeserve the calumny. Doubtless she was justly hurt by the incertitude of\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, who, after having plunged her into civil war in 1648\r\nwith no other motive than that of his own interest, would have made her\r\nabandon it in 1651 through the same motive still; which at one moment\r\nimpelled her towards the Fronde, at another brought her back to the\r\nCourt, at the will of his fickle hopes, and linked her with Madame de\r\nChatillon for the purpose of engaging Conde in negotiations the success\r\nof which involved their separation and procured her a prison in\r\nNormandy. Yes--she had grave cause of complaint against La\r\nRochefoucauld. She might have quitted him, it is true, but not for\r\nanother. She had only one means of covering, of almost condoning the\r\nsingle error of her life, which was to maintain faithful to it, or to\r\nrenounce it for virtue and Heaven. And it is just that which Madame de\r\nLongueville appears to have done, if that sad and rapid episode had\r\nremained unknown; but there is no favourable shade for those personages\r\nwho appear in the glaring front of the stage of this world; their\r\nslightest actions do not escape the formidable light of history: the\r\nweakness of a moment is recorded as an irredeemable error against them.\r\nThat of Madame de Longueville, fugitive as it may have been, dubious\r\neven as it was, sufficed to tarnish a fidelity until then victorious\r\nover so many trials; it needed to be atoned for by the sincere\r\nconversion which was speedily about to follow it, and by five-and-twenty\r\nyears of the severest penitence; and still further it forces us to place\r\nAnne de Bourbon, in the record of great sentiments and exalted loves,\r\nabove Heloise and Mademoiselle de la Valliere.\r\n\r\nAt any rate the assurance is consoling that this error, which we have\r\nattempted neither to conceal nor extenuate, is the single one\r\nperceptible in the private life of Madame de Longueville. But let us\r\nturn aside from these wretched instances of feminine fragility in one of\r\nthe loftiest minds, in order to follow Conde and the march of events in\r\nGuienne.\r\n\r\nWe will first, however, by a brief retrospect, endeavour to render the\r\nshifting phases of the two Fronde wars more capable of being easily\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nDating from the arrest of Broussel, nothing could exceed the rapidity of\r\nevents; the wheel of fortune had turned with such terrific mobility for\r\nthose of her favourites who sought to attach themselves to it. The\r\nrevolt had, in fact, broken out on the 26th of August, 1648; in January,\r\n1649, the Court withdrew to Saint Germain, at the risk of never\r\nre-entering Paris; in April, the sword of Conde imposed the treaty of\r\nSaint Germain, and the King returned in October. Mazarin shortly\r\nafterwards believed himself strong enough to arrest, in January, 1650,\r\nConde, Conti, and Longueville. A year after that bold _coup d'etat_ he\r\nwas himself obliged to flee (February, 1651) from his enemies, and quit\r\nFrance. At the end of eight months, Mazarin returned with an army to the\r\naid of royalty; but it required two years of negotiations, intrigues,\r\nand patient waiting, it needed the errors which the indecision of the\r\nDuke d'Orleans brought about, the rash violence of Conde, urged onwards\r\nby his sister, it required, indeed, the entire ruin of France ere the\r\nCardinal could, after having led the young King by the hand to the very\r\ngates of his capital, resume that place in the Louvre which he had\r\nsagaciously abandoned.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to narrate occurrences in their proper order during this\r\nperiod: intrigues, broken promises, pledges given to two different\r\nparties at the same time, such were the smallest misdeeds of all these\r\nprinces and prelates. As one step further in wrong-doing, they entered\r\ninto negotiations with the foreigner, and invited armies across the\r\nfrontier which devastated the provinces. And through what motives? Gondy\r\nwished to avenge his former mistress, whom Conti had rejected, and whom\r\nan agent of Conde, Maillard the shoemaker, had publicly insulted.\r\nConde's pretensions were nothing less than dragging at his heels a squad\r\nof governors of towns and provinces who, at his summons, would be ever\r\nready to raise the standard of revolt and to impose the will of their\r\nleader upon the head of the state, whether Minister, Queen, or King.\r\nOrleans would not yield one jot to his young cousin of the blood-royal,\r\nConde; Madame de Longueville feared the severity of an outraged husband.\r\nThe civil war, in forcing her to flee from one end of France to the\r\nother, or abroad, could alone delay her return to Normandy, her\r\nre-establishment beneath the conjugal roof, towards which she had\r\nconceived such an aversion.\r\n\r\nConde accused Gondy in the Parliament chamber of being author of a\r\n_factum_ condemning severely the Prince's conduct. La Rochefoucauld,\r\ngetting Gondy between two doors, treacherously seized, and was about to\r\nstrangle him, had not the son of the first President, M. de\r\nChamplatreux, come to the rescue, at the very moment that one of the\r\nbullies in Conde's pay had drawn his dagger to despatch him.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterwards (17th of September) the King had attained his\r\nthirteenth year, and one day beyond; and by the ordonnance of Charles V.\r\nbecame of age and capable of governing for himself.\r\n\r\nA change of ministry--Chateauneuf being recalled to head the Council and\r\nMole to the Seals--deprived Conde of all hope of imposing the conditions\r\nof a reconciliation; therefore, as has been said, at a Council held at\r\nChantilly with his chief adherents, Conti, and the Dukes de Nemours and\r\nLa Rochefoucauld, he determined to set out for Berri. The impartial\r\nstudent who examines the conduct of the Prince de Conde is at this\r\njuncture compelled to draw an indictment against him, under pain of\r\nbelying his conscience and the truth; he must concede that Conde rashly\r\nengaged in civil war, and exerted himself to drag France into it, solely\r\nbecause he could not endure any authority above his own. He was desirous\r\nof being first in the State, of disposing at will among his creatures of\r\nhonours, dignities, strongholds, and governments. On such conditions, he\r\nwould have consented to let Mazarin, Orleans, De Retz, or any other,\r\ngovern the realm, for the administration of which he felt himself that\r\nhe had neither the slightest inclination nor the smallest capacity\r\n(October, 1651).\r\n\r\nThe Fronde is reputed, not without reason, to have been one of the most\r\ninteresting as well as _diverting_ periods in French history; that in\r\nwhich the volatile and frivolous vivacity of the national character\r\nshone with irresistible comicality. How striking was the contrast\r\nbetween it in its main features and the great Civil War waged at the\r\nsame time in our own country! Yet the Fronde had its serious--terrible\r\naspect, too, in the wide-spread misery it entailed upon France, as may\r\nbe seen from the valuable statistical researches of M. Feillet. That\r\nwriter cites the following passage from the record of an eye-witness of\r\nwhat he describes:[4]--\"No tongue can tell, no pen describe, no ear may\r\nhear that which we have seen (at Rheims, Chalons, Rethel, &c). Famine\r\nand death on all sides, and bodies unburied. Those remaining alive pick\r\nup from the fields the rotten oat-straw, and make bread of it by mixing\r\nit with mud. Their faces are quite black; they have no longer the\r\nsemblance of human beings, but that of phantoms.... War has placed every\r\none on an equality; nobility lies upon straw, dares not beg, and\r\ndies.... Even lizards are eaten, and dogs which have been dead perhaps\r\nsome eight days.... Moreover, in Picardy, a band of five hundred\r\nchildren, orphans, and under seven years of age, was met with. In\r\nLorraine, the famished nuns quitted their convents and became\r\nmendicants: the poor creatures gave themselves up to be dishonoured for\r\nthe sake of a morsel of bread. No pity, no remorse. An execrable and\r\nsanguinary war upon the weak. In the heart of the city of Rheims, a\r\nbeautiful girl was chased from street to street for ten days by the\r\nlicentious soldiery; and as they could not catch her, they killed her by\r\nshooting her down. In the vicinity of Angers, Alais, and Condom, upon\r\nall the highways of Lorraine, women and children were indiscriminately\r\noutraged, and left to die drenched in their blood.\"\r\n\r\n    [4] La Misere dans la Fronde.\r\n\r\nWhat could be more _diverting_? The Duke de Lorraine--that restless\r\nknight-errant who preferred amusing himself with civil war to the quiet\r\nenjoyment of his throne--amused the noble ladies of his acquaintance\r\nwith a recital of these pleasant incidents; his gallant army, he said,\r\nwas quite a providence for the old women....\r\n\r\nAfter further pursuing his appalling statistics of the misery and\r\nhorrors inflicted by the Fronde at a later date, M. Feillet\r\nremarks:--\"And yet, notwithstanding all this suffering, which we have\r\nonly cursorily sketched, at Court nothing else was thought of but fetes\r\nand diversions; for the young and brilliant bevy of Mazarin's nieces had\r\ncome to increase the circle of beauties whom the youthful King and his\r\ngay courtiers vied with each other in paying homage to, and\r\nentertaining. The warm attachment of Louis for more than one of his\r\nMinister's nieces, and especially Marie de Mancini, is well known. In\r\nimitation of their Sovereign, the youthful nobility and a large portion\r\nof the city gallants plunged into unrestrained dissipation--intervals of\r\nlicentiousness ever succeeding like periods of turbulence and anarchy.\r\nSuch heartless indifference to the sufferings of the people on the part\r\nof the King and his Court evoked the following couplet, which was put\r\ninto the mouth of Louis by a contemporary pamphleteer:--\r\n\r\n\"Si la France est en deuil, qu'elle pleure et soupire;\r\n Pour moi, je veux chasser, galantiser et rire.\"\r\n\r\nBut we are somewhat anticipating events, and therefore return to them in\r\nthe order of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  CONDE'S ADVENTUROUS EXPEDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDE passed several months in Guienne, occupied with strengthening and\r\nextending the insurrection at the head of which he had placed himself,\r\nand in repulsing as far as possible in the south the royal army,\r\ncommanded by the skilful and experienced Count d'Harcourt. Amidst very\r\nvaried successes, he learned from different quarters the bad turn which\r\nthe Fronde's affairs was taking in the heart of the kingdom, the\r\nintrigues of De Retz who held the key of Paris, and the deplorable state\r\nof the army on the banks of the Loire.\r\n\r\nOn receiving these tidings at Bordeaux in the month of March, 1652,\r\nConde saw clearly the double danger which menaced him, and immediately\r\nfaced it in his wonted manner. Instead of awaiting events which were on\r\nthe eve of taking place at a distance, he determined on anticipating\r\nthem, and formed an extraordinary resolution, of a character very much\r\nresembling his great military manoeuvres, which at first sight appears\r\nextravagant, but which the gravest reason justifies, and the temerity of\r\nwhich even is only another form of high prudence. He formed the design\r\nof slipping out of Bordeaux, traversing the lines of Count d'Harcourt,\r\nto get over in the best way he might the hundred and fifty leagues which\r\nseparated him from the Loire and Paris, to appear there suddenly, and\r\nto place himself at the head of his affairs.\r\n\r\nHe left behind him in Guienne a force sufficiently imposing to allow of\r\nit there awaiting in security the successful results he was about to\r\nseek. In possessing himself of Agen, Bergerac, Perigueux, Cognac, and\r\neven for a moment of Saintes, and by pushing his conquests into Haute\r\nGuienne, on the side of Mont-de-Marsan, Dax, and Pau, he had made\r\nBordeaux the capital of a small but rich and populous kingdom,\r\nsurrounded on all sides by a belt of strongholds, communicating with the\r\nsea by the Gironde, and admirably placed for attack or defence. This\r\nkingdom, backed as it was by Spain, was capable of receiving continuous\r\nsuccour from Santander and St. Sebastian, and a Spanish fleet could\r\napproach by the Tour de Corduan, bringing subsidies and troops, whilst\r\nCount de Dognon's fleet, sailing from the islands of Re and Oleron to\r\njoin it, might easily surround and even beat the royal fleet, then\r\nforming at Brouage under the Duke de Vendome. In 1650, during the\r\nimprisonment of the princes, Bordeaux had defended itself for more than\r\nsix months against a considerable army with the young king at its head,\r\nand which was directed by Mazarin in person. Conde, and all his family\r\nwere adored there, by reason of the hatred felt for his predecessor, the\r\nimperious Duke d'Epernon. The Bordeaux parliament was also equally\r\ninvolved in the Fronde as was that of Paris, with which it had allied\r\nitself by a solemn declaration. Under the parliament was a brave and\r\nardent people, which furnished a numerous militia.\r\n\r\nConde had named the Prince de Conti his lieutenant-general--a prince of\r\nthe blood giving lustre to authority, dominating all rivalries, an\r\nappointment calculated to render obedience more easy. He was aware of\r\nConti's levity, but he knew also that he was wanting neither in\r\nintelligence nor courage. He believed in the ascendency which Madame de\r\nLongueville had always exercised over her brother, and he hoped she\r\nwould guide him still. He had confidence in that high-souled sister whom\r\nformerly he had so warmly loved; and although intrigues and a sinister\r\ninfluence, to which we shall shortly further allude, had diminished the\r\nhigh admiration he had had for her, and to which he later returned, he\r\nreckoned upon her intelligence, upon her pride, upon that lofty courage\r\nof which she had given so many proofs at Stenay. At his sister's side he\r\nleft his wife Claire Clemence de Maille-Breze, who had behaved so\r\nadmirably in the first Guienne war. He left her _enceinte_ with their\r\nsecond child, and with her he gave to Bordeaux and placed as it were in\r\npledge in its hands, to hold the place of himself, the Duke d'Enghien,\r\nthe hope and stay of his house, the peculiar object of his tenderness.\r\nSo that there, he left behind him a government, he thought, which would\r\nlook well alike in the eyes of France and of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn reality, to what did Conde aspire? To constitute himself the head of\r\nthe nobility against the Court? The nobles thought it harsh to be so\r\ntreated. To commence another Fronde? To do that, it was necessary to\r\nhave the parliaments under his thumb; and he had already been compelled\r\nto threaten the deputies of that of Aix with the bastinado. Did he look\r\nforward to an independent principality, as he later on desired to obtain\r\nfrom the Spaniards? Or rather did he think of snatching from the Duke\r\nd'Orleans the lieutenant-generalship? It is difficult to divine what may\r\nhave passed through his capricious brain. He was constant in nothing. It\r\nwas seen later still that he would very willingly have changed his\r\nreligion, offering himself on the one side to Cromwell, and to become a\r\nprotestant in order to have an English army; on the other to the Pope,\r\nif he would help to get him elected King of Poland.\r\n\r\nThe income of the Condes in 1609 amounted to ten thousand livres, and in\r\n1649, besides the Montmorency estates, they held an enormous portion of\r\nFrance. First, by the Great Conde, they had Burgundy, Berri, the marshes\r\nof Lorraine, a dominant fortress in the Bourbonnais that held in check\r\nfour provinces. Secondly, by Conti, Champagne. Thirdly, by Longueville,\r\ntheir sister's husband, Normandy. Fourthly, the Admiralty, and Saumur,\r\nthe chief fortress of Anjou, were in the hands of the brother of Conde's\r\nwife; they fell in through his death, and were sold again by them as\r\nthough they were a family birthright. Later still, they negotiated for\r\nthe possession of Guienne and Provence.\r\n\r\nAmidst the cares of administration and of war, Conde carried on an\r\nassiduous correspondence with Chavigny, then fallen into disgrace, who\r\nkept him well informed of the state of affairs at Court and in Paris.\r\nThey had assumed quite a new face during the last few months. Mazarin in\r\nhis exile had not learned without inquietude the ever-increasing success\r\nof Chateauneuf. He saw him active and determined, accepted as a chief by\r\nall colleagues, skilfully seconded by the keeper of the seals, Mole, and\r\nby Marshal de Villeroi, the king's governor, an ambiguous personage,\r\nvery ambitious at bottom, and jealous of the Cardinal's favour with the\r\nQueen. Chateauneuf, it is true, had only entered the Cabinet under the\r\nagreement of shortly recalling Mazarin; but he incessantly asked for\r\nfresh delay; he tried to make the Queen comprehend the danger of a\r\nprecipitate return,--the Fronde ready to arouse itself anew, the Duke\r\nd'Orleans and the Coadjutor resuming their ancient opposition, and\r\nroyalty finding itself once more without any solid support. Anne of\r\nAustria gradually acquiescing in these wise counsels, Mazarin, who at\r\nfirst had with difficulty restrained the impatient disposition of the\r\nQueen, finding her grown less eager, became alarmed: he saw that he was\r\nlost should he allow such a rival to establish himself.[1] Therefore,\r\npassing suddenly from an apparent resignation to an extraordinary\r\naudacity, he had, towards the end of November 1651, broken his ban,\r\nquitted his retreat at Dinan, and had resolutely entered France with a\r\nsmall force collected together by his two faithful friends, the Marquis\r\nde Navailles and the Count de Broglie, and led by Marshal Hocquincourt.\r\nHe had by main strength surmounted every obstacle, braved the decrees\r\nand the deputies of the parliament, reached Poitiers where the Queen and\r\nyoung Louis the Fourteenth had eagerly welcomed him; and there, in\r\nJanuary 1652, after speedily ridding himself of Chateauneuf, too proud\r\nand too able to be resigned to hold the second rank, he had again taken\r\nin hand the reins of government.\r\n\r\n    [1] Mad. de Motteville, tom. v. p. 96.\r\n\r\nThis bold conduct, which probably saved Mazarin, came also to the\r\nsuccour of Conde. The second and irreparable disgrace of the minister of\r\nthe old Fronde had exasperated him as well as had the umbrage given him\r\nby the Duke d'Orleans. He thought himself tricked by the Queen, and had\r\nloudly complained of it. Conde's friends had not failed to seize that\r\noccasion to reconcile him with the Duke, and to negotiate a fresh\r\nalliance between them; and as previously the Fronde and the Queen had\r\nbeen united against Conde, so also at the end of January 1652, that\r\nPrince and the Fronde in almost its entirety were united against\r\nMazarin.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chevreuse alone, with her most intimate friends, remained\r\nfaithful to her hatred and the Queen, dreading far less Mazarin than\r\nConde, and choosing between them both for once and for all with her\r\nwell-known firmness and resolution. De Retz trimmed, followed the Duke\r\nd'Orleans, using tact with the Queen, so that he might not lose the hat,\r\nand without engaging himself personally with Conde.\r\n\r\nIf Burnet is to be believed, it was at this conjunction that Conde made\r\nan offer to Cromwell to turn Huguenot, and embrace the faith of his\r\nancestors, in order to secure the aid of the English Puritans.\r\n\r\nHowever that might be, it was not illusory to think that with such a\r\ngovernment and the continual assistance of Spain, Bordeaux might hold\r\nout for at least a year, and give Conde time to strike some decisive\r\nblows. The resolution that he took was therefore as rational as it was\r\ngreat. It would have been a sovereign imprudence to remain in Guienne\r\nmerely to engage Harcourt in a series of trifling skirmishes, and after\r\nmuch time and trouble take a few little paltry towns, when in the heart\r\nof the kingdom a treason or a defeat might irreparably involve the loss\r\nof everything, and condemn Bordeaux to share the common fate, after a\r\nmore or less prolonged existence. Taking one thing with another, Guienne\r\nwas doubtless a considerable accessory; but the grand struggle was not\r\nto be made there; it was at Paris and upon the banks of the Loire that\r\nthe destiny of the Fronde and that of Conde too must be decided; it was\r\nthither, therefore, that he must hasten. Every day brought him tidings\r\nthat jealousies, divisions, quarrels were increasing in the army, and he\r\ntrembled to receive, some morning, news that Turenne and Hocquincourt\r\nhad beaten Nemours and Beaufort, and were marching on Paris. Desirous of\r\npreventing at any price a disaster so irreparable, he resolved to rush\r\nto the point where the danger was supreme, where his unexpected presence\r\nwould strike terror into the souls of his enemies, revive the courage of\r\nhis partisans and turn fortune to his side. When Caesar, on arriving in\r\nGreece, learned that the fleet which was following him with his army on\r\nboard, had been dispersed and destroyed by that of Pompey, he flung\r\nhimself alone into a fisherman's bark under cover of night to cross the\r\nsea into Asia to seek for the legions of Antony, and return with them to\r\ngain the battle of Pharsalia. When Napoleon learned in Egypt the state\r\nof France, from the shameful doings of the Directory, the agitation of\r\nparties, and that already more than one general was meditating another\r\n18th of Brumaire, he did not hesitate, and however rash it might appear\r\nto attempt to pass through the English fleet in a small craft, at the\r\nrisk of being taken, or sent to the bottom, he dared every peril, and by\r\ndint of address and audacity succeeded in gaining the shores of France.\r\nConde did the same, and at the end of March 1652, he undertook to make\r\nhis way from the banks of the Gironde to the banks of the Loire, without\r\nother escort than that of a small number of intrepid friends, and\r\nsustained solely by the vivid consciousness of the necessity of that\r\nbold step, his familiarity with and secret liking for danger, his\r\nincomparable presence of mind and his customary gaiety.\r\n\r\nOn Palm Sunday, 1652, Conde set forth upon his adventurous expedition.\r\nHe was accompanied by six persons, La Rochefoucauld and his youthful\r\nson, the Prince de Marcillac, the Count de Guitaut, the Count de\r\nChavagnac, a valet named Rochefort, and the indefatigable Gourville,\r\nunder whose directions all the arrangements of the journey seem to have\r\nbeen contrived. The whole party were disguised as common troopers, and\r\neach took a false name, even amongst themselves. For some time they\r\nfollowed the Bordeaux road, and using many precautions proceeded until\r\nthey reached Cahusac, where they encountered some troops belonging to La\r\nRochefoucauld; but being anxious almost as much to avoid their own\r\npartizans as the enemy, Conde and his companions hid themselves in a\r\nbarn, while Gourville went out to forage. He succeeded in procuring some\r\nscanty fare; and they rode on till some hours had passed after\r\nnightfall, when they reached a little wayside inn, where Conde\r\nvolunteered to cook an omelet for the whole party. The hand, however,\r\nwhich could wield a truncheon with such effect, proved somewhat too\r\nviolent for the frying-pan, and in the attempt to turn the omelet, he\r\nthrew the whole hissing mass into the fire.\r\n\r\nThe little band having reached a certain spot, quitted the main road,\r\nand began to traverse the enemy's lines. For eight days they encountered\r\nmany perilous incidents and underwent incredible fatigue, riding\r\nthroughout the same horses, never stopping more than two hours to eat or\r\nsleep, avoiding towns and crossing rivers as they best could; threading\r\nat first the gorges of the Auvergne mountains, then descending by the\r\nBec d'Allier, and making their way to the Loire. The memoirs of La\r\nRochefoucauld and Gourville must be consulted for the details of that\r\nextraordinary journey, and all the dangers it presented. No less than\r\nten times did they escape being taken and slain. Their wearied horses at\r\nlast could carry them no longer. La Rochefoucauld was tormented by the\r\ngout, and his son was so worn out with fatigue that he fell asleep as\r\nhe went. Conde, whose iron frame resisted to the last, was alone\r\nindefatigable, sleeping and working at will, and always cheerful and\r\ngood humoured.\r\n\r\nUpon approaching Gien, at which place the Court then was, Conde had\r\ntwice very nearly fallen into the hands of parties sent out to take him\r\nalive or dead. Having escaped almost by a miracle, on the last occasion,\r\nsoon after reaching Chatillon, he gained information that the army of\r\nBeaufort and Nemours lay at about eight leagues from that place, and\r\nhastened with all speed to join it. At length, to his great joy, he saw\r\nthe advanced guard before him, and several of the troopers came\r\ngalloping up with a loud \"_Qui vive!_\" Some of them, however, almost\r\ninstantly recognised Conde, and shouts of joy and surprise soon made\r\nknown through the whole army what had occurred.\r\n\r\nHe found the forces of the Fronde as divided as were its chiefs. He took\r\nthe command of it immediately; thus doing away with the principal cause\r\nof the jealousy existing between Nemours and Beaufort. He reviewed and\r\nreunited it, gave it one day's rest, seized, without striking a blow, on\r\nMontargis and Chateau-Renard, and threw himself with the utmost rapidity\r\non the royal army. It was scattered in quarters distant from each other\r\nfor the convenience of foraging, and on account of the little dread with\r\nwhich Beaufort and Nemours had inspired it. Marshal d'Hocquincourt was\r\nencamped at Bleneau, and Turenne a little farther off, at Briare; the\r\ntwo Marshals were to unite their forces on the morrow. Conde did not\r\ngive them time for that: that same evening, and during the nights of the\r\n6th and 7th of April, 1652, he fell upon the head-quarters of\r\nHocquincourt, overwhelmed them, and succeeded in routing the rest,\r\nthanks to one of those charges in flank which he in person ever led so\r\nenergetically. Hocquincourt, after fighting like a gallant soldier, was\r\nforced to fall back for some leagues in the direction of Auxerre, having\r\nlost all his baggage and three thousand horse. No sooner did Turenne\r\nhear of the fact, than he sprang into the saddle, and marched with some\r\ninfantry both to the assistance of his brother officer and to the\r\ndefence of the King, who, resting secure at Gien, might have fallen into\r\nthe hands of the rebels. As he advanced through the darkness of the\r\nnight, the Marshal saw the quarters of Hocquincourt in one blaze of\r\nfire, and exclaiming, with the appreciation which genius has of genius,\r\n\"The Prince de Conde is arrived!\" he hurried on with the utmost speed.\r\nHaving neither cavalry nor artillery, and having sent word to\r\nHocquincourt to rally to him as soon as possible, he marched on in good\r\norder throughout that long and dark night to join the bulk of his troops\r\nwhich Navailles and Palluan were bringing up. For an instant he halted\r\nin a plain where there stood a rather dense wood on his left, with a\r\nmarsh on his right. Those around Conde thought it an advantageous post;\r\nConde judged very differently. \"If M. de Turenne makes a stand there,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I shall soon cut him to pieces; but he will take good care not\r\nto do so.\"[2] He had not left off speaking when he saw that Turenne was\r\nalready retiring, too skilful to await Conde in the plain and expose\r\nhimself to the Prince's formidable manoeuvres. A little further off,\r\nhe found a position much more favourable; there he firmly posted his\r\nforce, determined to give battle. In vain did his officers urge him not\r\nto hazard an action, not to risk the last army which remained to the\r\nmonarchy, and to confine himself to covering Gien whilst awaiting the\r\ncoming of Hocquincourt. \"_No_,\" replied he, \"_we must conquer or perish\r\nhere._\"\r\n\r\n    [2] It is Tavannes who has preserved the details of this interesting\r\n    incident.\r\n\r\nTurenne, it is true, was very inferior in cavalry to Conde, but he had a\r\npowerful and well-served artillery. Having encouraged his troops to do\r\ntheir duty, he posted himself upon an eminence which he covered with\r\ninfantry and artillery, drew up his cavalry below in a plain too narrow\r\nto permit of Conde deploying his own, and which could only be reached by\r\ntraversing a thick wood and a causeway intersected by ditches and boggy\r\nground. From such strong position, Conde could, in his turn, recognise\r\nhis illustrious disciple. No great manoeuvres were then practicable,\r\nand as time did not permit of an attempt to turn Turenne, it was\r\nnecessary to crush him out of hand, if that were possible, before he\r\ncould effect a junction with Hocquincourt. The defile was the key of the\r\nposition; and both sides fought therein with equal fierceness. Turenne\r\ndefended himself sword in hand, and upon the six squadrons which Conde\r\nhurled against him he opened a battery, as they passed, with terrible\r\nexecution, showing a courage equal to that of his heroic adversary.\r\nConde, judging from what he now saw, believed the position in the hands\r\nof Turenne to be impregnable; and it being too late to execute any other\r\nmanoeuvres with success during that day, he continued to cannonade the\r\nroyalist army till the evening, without any other attempt to bring it to\r\na battle.\r\n\r\nNapoleon has not spared Conde in this affair any more than other\r\ncritics. He sums all their opinions up in one piquant phrase, which it\r\nappears he was unable to resist, and which made him smile in uttering\r\nit. \"Conde,\" said he, \"for that once, was wanting in boldness.\" The\r\ndictum is both brief and incisive, but there was no foundation for it,\r\nin a military point of view. There was, in truth, no want of boldness on\r\nConde's part throughout that campaign: far from it, his whole line of\r\nconduct was a succession of audacious actions and combinations. What\r\ncould be bolder than that forced journey of nearly ten days for more\r\nthan one hundred and fifty miles with half-a-dozen followers to go and\r\ntake the command of an army? What bolder than the resolution taken out\r\nof hand to throw himself between Turenne and Hocquincourt, to cut in two\r\nthe royal army and to disperse one half of it before attacking the\r\nother? Did Conde lose a moment in marching against Turenne and pursuing\r\nhim sword in hand? Was it his fault that he had to cope with a great\r\ncaptain, who knew how to select an excellent position, and to maintain\r\nhimself in it with immovable firmness? In the attack of that position,\r\ndid Napoleon mean to reproach Conde with want of boldness? Turenne, it\r\nis true, covered himself with glory, for he successfully resisted Conde;\r\nbut Conde, in not having been victorious, was not in the slightest\r\ndegree beaten. The strategy, therefore, on that occasion was\r\nirreproachable. As will be seen, it was in his policy only that he\r\nfailed. Conde quitted the army at a very ill-timed moment, in our\r\nopinion, but that step was taken through considerations which had\r\nnothing to do with the science of war.\r\n\r\nTo revert for a moment to this much-criticised action of Bleneau.\r\nTowards night, Hocquincourt appeared upon the field, having rallied a\r\nconsiderable part of his cavalry. Conde then retired, finding that his\r\nattempt was frustrated, and took the way to Montargis; while Turenne\r\nrejoined the Court, and was received by the Queen with all the\r\ngratitude which such great services merited. Her first words went to\r\nthank him for _having placed the crown a second time upon her son's\r\nhead_.\r\n\r\nThe terror and confusion which had reigned in Gien during the whole of\r\nthe preceding night and that day may very well be conceived when it is\r\nremembered that the safety of the King himself, as well as the Queen,\r\nwas at stake, and that the life of the favourite Minister might at any\r\nmoment be placed at the mercy of his bitterest enemy, justified in\r\nputting him to death immediately by the highest legal authority in the\r\nrealm. Neither were the ill-disciplined and irregular forces of Conde at\r\nall desirable neighbours to the troop of ladies who had followed the\r\nCourt; and, as soon as it was known that Conde had fallen upon\r\nHocquincourt, the whole of the little town was one scene of dismay and\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\nThe royal army and that of Conde now both marched towards Paris, nearly\r\nupon two parallel lines. But the great distress which the Court suffered\r\nfrom want of money caused almost as much insubordination to be apparent\r\namongst the troops of the King as amongst those of the rebels. Little\r\nrespect was shown to Mazarin himself; and the young King was often\r\ntreated with but scanty ceremony, and provided for but barely.\r\n\r\nAfter quitting the neighbourhood of Gien, Conde, urged by the desire of\r\ndirecting in person the negotiations and intrigues which were going on\r\nin Paris, left his army under the command of the celebrated Tavannes,\r\nand hastened to the capital. The Count de Tavannes, whom he had selected\r\nto fill his own place, was without doubt an excellent officer, one of\r\nthe valiant _Petits-maitres_[3] who, upon the field of battle, served\r\nas wings to the great soldier's thoughts, carried his orders everywhere,\r\nexecuted the most dangerous manoeuvres, sometimes charging with an\r\nirresistible impetuosity, at others sustaining the most terrible onsets\r\nwith a firmness and solidity beyond all proof. But though the intrepid\r\nTavannes was quite capable of leading the division of a great army, he\r\nwas not able enough to be its commander-in-chief, and he had not\r\nauthority over the foreign troops which the Duke de Nemours had brought\r\nfrom Flanders, and which he made over, on accompanying Conde to Paris,\r\nto the command of the Count de Clinchamp. The army, thus divided, was\r\ncapable of nothing great. Conde alone could finish what he had begun.\r\nOnce engaged in the formidable enterprise that he had undertaken against\r\nthe Queen and Mazarin, there was no safety for him but in carrying it\r\nout even to the end. He ought, therefore, to have waged war to the\r\nknife, if the expression be allowable, against Turenne, conquered or\r\nperished, and to have constrained Mazarin to flee for good and all to\r\nGermany or Italy, and the Queen to place in his hands the young King. To\r\ndo that, Conde should have had a definite ambition, an object clearly\r\ndetermined; he ought to have plainly proposed to himself to assume the\r\nRegency, or at least the lieutenant-generalship of the kingdom in the\r\nplace of Gaston, by will or by force, in order to concentrate all power\r\nin his own hands; that he might become, in short, a Cromwell or a\r\nWilliam III.: and Conde was neither the one or the other. His mind had\r\nbeen perturbed by sinister dreams; but, as has been remarked, he had at\r\nheart an invincible fund of loyalty. Ambition was rather hovering round\r\nhim than within himself. But whatsoever it was he desired, and in every\r\nhypothesis--for his secret has remained between Heaven and himself--he\r\ndid wrong in abandoning the Loire and leaving Turenne in force there.\r\nThat was the true error he committed, and not in wanting audacity, as\r\nNapoleon supposed. It was not a military but a political error--immense\r\nand irreparable. He might have crushed Turenne, and ought to have\r\nattempted it, but he let him slip from his grasp. The opportunity once\r\nlost did not return. Turenne until then was only second in rank; by a\r\nglorious resistance he acquired from that moment, and it was forced upon\r\nhim to maintain, the importance of a rival of Conde. Mazarin grew from\r\nday to day more emboldened; royalty, which had been on the very brink of\r\nruin, again rose erect, and the Court drew towards Paris; whilst,\r\nprompted by his evil genius, quitting the field of battle wherein lay\r\nhis veritable strength, Conde went away to waste his precious time in a\r\nlabyrinth of intrigues for which he was not fitted, and in which he lost\r\nhimself and the Fronde.\r\n\r\n    [3] Upon the _Petits Maitres_, see Mad. de Sable, chap. i. p. 44.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  POLITICAL AND GALLANT INTRIGUES--THE DUCHESS DE CHATILLON'S SWAY OVER\r\n  CONDE--SHAMEFUL CONSPIRACY AGAINST MADAME DE LONGUEVILLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDE arrived in Paris on the 11th of April, and found everything in the\r\nutmost confusion. It would be impossible to follow all the petty\r\nintrigues, or even make allusion to all the events which affected the\r\nrelative situations of the parties in the capital; but it may be\r\nobserved that the tendency of both parties was to hold themselves in the\r\nneighbourhood of Paris. The chiefs of the Fronde hurried into the city,\r\nto receive the congratulations due to their exploits from the fair\r\npoliticians who had won them to their cause. The Queen also established\r\nher head-quarters near the capital, to be ready for any turn of popular\r\nsentiment in her favour, and to hear the reports of her spies on the\r\nproceedings of her enemies. She knew what dances were to be given, and\r\nwho were to attend the assemblies of the duchesses of the Fronde. On one\r\noccasion when Turenne knew that half the officers of Conde's army were\r\nengaged to a brilliant fete at the Duchess de Montbazon's, he made an\r\nattack on the enemy's camp, and was only repulsed by the steadiness of\r\nsome old soldiers, who gave time for reinforcements to arrive. But the\r\ncrisis was at hand; for each party began to be suspicious of the other\r\ngaining over its supporters--Mazarin lavishing promises of place and\r\nmoney, and the Duchess de Chatillon, invested with full powers by\r\nConde, appearing in the opposite camp as the most irresistible\r\nambassadress that ever was seen.\r\n\r\nThus matters stood in the early summer of 1652, and \"all that was most\r\nsubtle and serious in politics,\" La Rochefoucauld tells us, \"was brought\r\nunder the attention of Conde to induce him to take one of two\r\ncourses--to make peace or to continue the war; when Madame de Chatillon\r\nimbued him with a design for peace by means the most agreeable. She\r\nthought that so great a boon might be the work of her beauty, and\r\nmingling ambition with the design of making a new conquest, she desired\r\nat the same time to triumph over the Prince de Conde's heart and to\r\nderive pecuniary advantages from her political negotiations.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already cursorily mentioned the Duchess de Chatillon: it is now\r\nindispensable, in order to thoroughly understand what is about to\r\nfollow, to know something more of that celebrated personage.\r\n\r\nIsabella Angelique de Montmorency was one of the two daughters of that\r\nbrave and unfortunate Count de Montmorency Bouteville, who, the victim\r\nof a false point of honour and of an outrageous passion for duelling,\r\nwas decapitated on the Place de Greve, on the 21st of June, 1627. She\r\nwas sister of Francois de Montmorency, Count de Bouteville, better known\r\nas the illustrious Marshal de Luxembourg. Born in 1626, she had been\r\nmarried in 1645 to the last of the Colignys, the Duke de Chatillon, one\r\nof the heroes of Lens, killed in the action of Charenton in 1649. Left a\r\nwidow at twenty-three, her rare loveliness won for her a thousand\r\nadorers. She was one of the queens of politics and gallantry during the\r\nFronde; and even, after manifold amours, at thirty-eight could boast of\r\ncaptivating the Duke de Mecklenbourg, who espoused her in 1664. To\r\nbeauty, Madame de Chatillon added great intelligence, but an\r\nintelligence wholly devoted to intrigue. She was vain and ambitious, and\r\nat the same time profoundly selfish, moderately scrupulous, and somewhat\r\nof the school of Madame de Montbazon. While both were young, she had\r\nsmitten Conde; but he had thought no more of her after becoming absorbed\r\nwith his love for Mademoiselle de Vigean. After that elevated passion,\r\nso sorrowfully terminated,[1] and after the fugitive emotion with which\r\nthe lovely and virtuous Mademoiselle de Toussy could still inspire him,\r\nConde stifled his chevalaresque instincts and bade adieu to the _haute\r\ngalanterie_ of his youth and of the Hotel de Rambouillet. A few\r\ninsignificant and commonplace attachments, of which no record has\r\nsurvived, alone excepted, Madame de Chatillon only is known to have\r\ncaptivated his heart for the last time; and that _liaison_ exercised\r\nupon Conde and his affairs, at the epoch at which we have arrived, an\r\ninfluence sufficiently great for history to occupy itself therewith, if\r\nit would not be content with retracing consequences and as it were the\r\noutline of events which pass across the stage of the world without being\r\nunderstood, without penetrating to the true causes which are to be\r\ndiscovered in the characters and passions of mankind. And, of all\r\npassions, there is none at once more energetic and wide-grasping than\r\nlove. It occupies an immense place in human life, and in the loftiest as\r\nwell as the lowliest conditions. In our own times, we have seen it make\r\nand mar kings. In an earlier epoch, by detaining Antony too long in\r\nCleopatra's arms at Alexandria, the formidable tempest gathered above\r\nhis head which nearly overwhelmed him at Munda. It played a great part\r\nin the war which Henry IV. was about to undertake, when a sudden death\r\narrested him. One can scarcely resist a smile on seeing historians for\r\nthe most part taking no account of it, as a thing too frivolous, and\r\nconsigning it altogether to private life, as though that which agitates\r\nthe soul so powerfully were not the principle of that which blazes forth\r\nexteriorly! No, the empire of beauty knows no limitation, and in no\r\ninstance did it show itself more potent than over those great hearts of\r\nwhich Alexander the Great, Caesar, Charlemagne, and Henry IV. of France\r\nwere the owners. We may well place Conde amongst such illustrious\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\n    [1] Mademoiselle de Vigean took the veil on the prince being forced\r\n    to marry the niece of Cardinal Richelieu.\r\n\r\nOne graceful memento of Madame de Chatillon's power over Conde has\r\ndescended to our own day. At Chatillon-sur-Loing, in what remains of the\r\nancient chateau of the Colignys, which Isabelle de Montmorency derived\r\nfrom her husband and left to her brother, in that salon of the noble\r\nheir of the Luxembourgs, as precious for history as for art, wherein may\r\nbe seen collected together, by the side of the sword of the Constable\r\nAnne, the likeness of Luxembourg on horseback, with his proud and\r\npiercing glance, as well as the full-length portrait of Charlotte\r\nMarguerite de Montmorency, Princess de Conde, in widow's weeds, there is\r\nalso a large and magnificent picture, representing a young woman of\r\nravishing beauty, with perfectly regular features, with the loveliest\r\nbright chestnut hair, grey eyes of the softest expression, a swan-like\r\nneck, of a slight and graceful figure, painted with a natural grandeur,\r\nand embellished with all the attractions of youth, enhanced by an\r\nexquisite air of coquetry. She is seated in an easy attitude. One of her\r\nhands, carelessly extended, holds a bouquet of flowers; the other rests\r\nupon the mane of a lion, whose head is drawn full-face, and whose\r\nflaming eyes are unmistakably the terrible eyes of Conde when seen with\r\nhis sword drawn. Here we behold the beautiful Duchess de Chatillon at\r\ntwenty-five or twenty-six, and very nearly such as she has taken care to\r\ndescribe herself in the _Divers Portraits_ of Mademoiselle de\r\nMontpensier. The head stands out wonderfully. It would be impossible to\r\ninstance a more charming countenance, but it is somewhat deficient in\r\ncharacter and grandeur, and quite different from that of Madame de\r\nLongueville. The latter's face was not so regularly symmetrical, but it\r\nwore a far loftier expression, and an air of supreme distinction\r\ncharacterised her entire person.\r\n\r\nMadame de Chatillon and Madame de Longueville had been brought up\r\ntogether, and very much attached during the whole of their early youth.\r\nBy degrees there sprung up a rivalry of beauty between them, and they\r\nquarrelled thoroughly when Madame de Longueville perceived after the\r\ndeath of Chatillon, that the young and beautiful widow, at the same time\r\nthat she was welcoming very decidedly the homage of the Duke de Nemours,\r\nhad also evident designs upon Conde. Madame de Longueville had her own\r\nreasons for not being then very severe upon others, but she knew the\r\nself-seeking heart of the fair Duchess, and she was alarmed for her\r\nbrother's sake. She feared lest Madame de Chatillon, having great need\r\nof Court favour, might retain Conde in the engagements which he had with\r\nMazarin, while she herself was forced to drag him into the Fronde. The\r\nquarrel was renewed in 1651, as we have seen, and it was in full force\r\nin 1652. Madame de Chatillon and Madame de Longueville were then\r\ndisputing for Conde's heart: the one drew him towards the Court, fully\r\nhoping that the Court would not be ungrateful to her; the other urged\r\nhim more and more upon the path of war. We have related how Madame de\r\nLongueville, well knowing the strength of Conde's friendship for the\r\nDuke de Nemours, who was in the chains of the Duchess, very\r\ninopportunely mingled politics and coquetry in Berri, and tried the\r\npower of her charms upon Nemours, in order to carry him off from Madame\r\nde Chatillon and from the party of peace. No one ever knew how far\r\nMadame de Longueville committed herself on that occasion; but, as we\r\nhave remarked, the slightest appearance was enough for La Rochefoucauld.\r\nAs he had only sought his own advantage in the Fronde, not finding it\r\ntherein, he began to grow tired, and asked for nothing better than to\r\nput an end to the wandering and adventurous life he had been for some\r\nyears leading by a favourable reconciliation. Madame de Longueville's\r\nconduct in cutting him to the quick in what remained of his tender\r\nfeelings for her, and especially in the most sensitive portion of his\r\nheart--its vanity and self-love--gave him an opportunity or a pretext,\r\nwhich he seized upon with eagerness, to break off a _liaison_ become\r\ncontrary to his interests. Thus, in April, 1652, when he returned to\r\nParis with Conde, and there found Madame de Chatillon, he entered at\r\nonce into all her prejudices and all her designs, as he afterwards owned\r\nto Madame de Motteville:[2] he placed at her service all that was in him\r\nof skill and ability, and descended to the indulgence of a revenge\r\nagainst Madame de Longueville wholly unworthy of an honourable man, and\r\nwhich after the lapse of two centuries is as revolting to every\r\nright-minded person as it was to his contemporaries.\r\n\r\n    [2] Mad. de Motteville, tom. v. p. 132. \"M. de la Rochefoucauld m'a\r\n    dit que la jalousie et la vengeance le firent agir soigneusement, et\r\n    qu'il fit tout ce que Mad. de Chatillon voulut.\"\r\n\r\nMadame de Chatillon was not contented with carrying off the giddy and\r\ninconstant Duke de Nemours from his new love, then absent; she exacted\r\nat his hands the public and outrageous sacrifice of her rival. The\r\nreprisals of feminine vanity did not stop there: the ambitious and\r\nintriguing Duchess went further, she undertook to ruin Madame de\r\nLongueville in her brother's estimation. With that object she set\r\nherself, with the assistance of La Rochefoucauld, to decry her in every\r\nway to him, and sought even to persuade him that his sister was not\r\nattached to him as she made it appear, and that she had promised the\r\nDuke de Nemours to serve him at his expense; whilst Madame de\r\nLongueville had never dreamed in any way of separating Nemours from\r\nConde, but only from her, Madame de Chatillon, purposely to engage him\r\nmore deeply in Conde's interests, in the light that she understood them.\r\n\r\nMadame de Longueville's policy was very simple, and it was the true one,\r\nthe Fronde once admitted. Assuredly, it would have been better alike for\r\nMadame de Longueville, for Conde, and for France not to have entered\r\nupon that fatal path by which the national greatness was for ten years\r\narrested, and through which the house of Conde very nearly perished;\r\nbut, after having embraced that sinister step, no other alternative\r\nremained to a firm and logical mind than to resolutely pursue its\r\ntriumph. And that triumph, in Madame de Longueville's eyes, was the\r\noverthrow of Mazarin, a necessary condition of the domination of Conde.\r\nSuch was the end pointed out to her by La Rochefoucauld when engaging\r\nher in the Fronde at the beginning of 1648, and she had never lost sight\r\nof it. It was to attain it that she had flung herself into the Civil\r\nWar, and that she had ended by dragging therein her brother; that,\r\nworsted at Paris in 1649, she had striven in 1650 to raise Normandy;\r\nthat she had risked her life, braved exile, made alliance with a foreign\r\nenemy, and unfurled at Stenay the banner of the Princes. In 1651, she\r\nhad advised the resumption of arms, and now she maintained the\r\nimpossibility of laying them down, and that, instead of losing himself\r\nin useless negotiations with the subtle and skilful Cardinal, it was\r\nupon his sword alone that Conde should rely. She thought him incapable\r\nof extricating himself advantageously from the intrigues by which he was\r\nsurrounded, and therefore urged him towards the field of battle. She had\r\nalways exercised a great sway over him, because he knew that her heart\r\nwas of like temper to his own; and if passion had not blinded him, he\r\nwould have rejected with disdain the odious accusations they had dared\r\nto raise against her, as he had done in 1643, in the affair of the\r\nletters attributed to her by Madame de Montbazon: he would have easily\r\nrecognised that Madame de Chatillon, Nemours, and La Rochefoucauld would\r\nnot have joined to blacken her in his eyes, as a vulgar creature ever\r\nready to betray him for the latest lover, save in the manifest design of\r\nembroiling them both, of securing him, and of making him subserve their\r\nparticular views. Nemours alone knew what had taken place during that\r\njourney from Montrond to Bordeaux, and the man who is base enough to\r\nconstitute himself the denouncer of a woman to whom he has paid the\r\nwarmest homage, is not very worthy of being believed on his word.\r\nBesides Nemours has not himself spoken, but Madame de Chatillon and\r\nRochefoucauld, who have attributed to him certain sentiments, and we\r\nknow with what motive.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to imagine a conspiracy more disgraceful than that\r\nformed at this juncture against Madame de Longueville; and that feature\r\nin it the more shameful perhaps was that La Rochefoucauld himself boasts\r\nof having invented and worked this machinery, as he terms it. The three\r\nconspirators were dumb, but through different but equally despicable\r\nreasons. Madame de Chatillon desired singly to govern Conde, and alone\r\nto represent him at Court, in order to reap the profits of the\r\nnegotiation. Nemours was desirous of pleasing Madame de Chatillon, and\r\nlooked forward also to have his share in the great advantages promised\r\nhim; and, lastly, La Rochefoucauld was actuated by a pitiless spirit of\r\nrevenge, and in the hope of a reconciliation necessary to his own\r\nimmediate fortunes.\r\n\r\nBut here arose a delicate point, if we may speak of delicacy in such a\r\nmatter: in the whole cabal, the least odious was, after all, the Duke de\r\nNemours, more frivolous than perfidious, and who was deeply smitten with\r\nMadame de Chatillon. He loved her, and was beloved. The return of the\r\nPrince de Conde, with his well-declared pretensions, caused him cruel\r\nsuffering, and his rage threatened to upset the well-concerted scheme.\r\nThe lovely lady herself could not sometimes help being embarrassed\r\nbetween an imperious prince and a jealous lover. Happily the future\r\nauthor of the _Maxims_ was at hand. La Rochefoucauld took upon himself\r\nto arrange everything in the best way possible. It was not very\r\ndifficult for him to direct Madame de Chatillon how to manage Conde and\r\nNemours both at once, and to contrive in such a way that she might\r\nsecure them both.
