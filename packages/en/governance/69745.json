You have been clamoring in the most\r\nimportunate and flattering fashion for a re-issue of the Cartoons of\r\n_Grip_, and out of pure good humour, I have gone to work and _re-drawn_\r\nthem for you, because, you must know, these destiny-shaping pictures were\r\nnot originally engraved upon wood, but were produced by lithography,\r\nand in due time each was utterly erased from the stone to make way for\r\nbill-heads and cigar labels. This has been no light task, but of course\r\nmy good will towards men, together with the anticipation of being an\r\nauthor and writing an “introduction,” made it a labour of love. Now, the\r\nfact of the public request aforesaid will spare me the usual editorial\r\nhumiliation of an introductory apology; and I need say nothing here about\r\nthe subject matter of the sketches, as I have written an explanatory\r\nnote (comprehensive and lucid enough I hope) opposite to each, and,\r\ntherefore, my prefatory remarks are complete—with, by the way, a word to\r\nthe Critics. Dear Critics, I defy you to do your worst. This work, as you\r\nknow in your heart of hearts, is above criticism. There are no errata to\r\nbe found in the text, and no false perspective or other defects in the\r\ndrawings. If you hit upon anything that may persuade you to the contrary\r\npray don’t write it. Come and see me personally at No. 2 Toronto Street,\r\nwhere I have hung my basket, and every Saturday croak “Never Say Die” to\r\nan ever increasing circle of patrons. But what an ungrateful rook I am to\r\nbe sure, thus impudently chattering to those who have shown me nothing\r\nbut generosity during my career, and to be thus boring the generous\r\nCanadian Public who have, with unexampled goodness, bestowed their\r\nfavours on\r\n\r\n                           Their humble Raven,\r\n\r\n                                                                     Grip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Canada’s Farewell to Punshon,                                        1\r\n\r\n    After the Session; or, The Situation,                                2\r\n\r\n    The New Mother Hubbard,                                              3\r\n\r\n    Law and Justice,                                                     4\r\n\r\n    The Huntington Business,                                             5\r\n\r\n    An Overworked Mayor,                                                 6\r\n\r\n    Canada’s “Laocoon,”                                                  7\r\n\r\n    Will he come to Grief?                                               8\r\n\r\n    Dufferin’s Tormentors, or “Per vias Rectas,”                         9\r\n\r\n    Isn’t that a Dainty Dish to set before a King?                      10\r\n\r\n    Whither are we Drifting?                                            11\r\n\r\n    The Beauties of a Royal Commission,                                 12\r\n\r\n    Waiting for Huntington,                                             13\r\n\r\n    Wanted, a Good Stout Boy,                                           14\r\n\r\n    The Irrepressible Showman,                                          15\r\n\r\n    Blackwash and Whitewash,                                            16\r\n\r\n    “We in Canada seem to have lost all idea of Justice, Honour and\r\n      Integrity,”                                                       17\r\n\r\n    “Progressing Favourably,”                                           18\r\n\r\n    Rehearsing for the 23rd instant,                                    19\r\n\r\n    “Will he get through?”                                              20\r\n\r\n    A case of _Riel_ Distress,                                          21\r\n\r\n    “Of comfort no man speak.

MORLEY PUNSHON for England, after a few years’\r\nsojourn in Canada as President of the Wesleyan Conference, took place\r\non the 24th of May, 1873, (the day on which the first number of _Grip_\r\nappeared.)\r\n\r\n    MAY 24th, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 1.\r\n\r\nCANADA’S FAREWELL TO PUNSHON.\r\n\r\nCANADA—GOOD BYE THEN, DOCTOR, AND REMEMBER ME KINDLY TO THE OLD FOLKS AT\r\nHOME.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 2.\r\n\r\n“_After the Session._”\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 2nd April, 1873, Hon. L. S. Huntington, member for Shefford, from\r\nhis place in the House, charged Sir John A. Macdonald, Premier of the\r\nConservative Government, with having corruptly sold to Sir Hugh Allan,\r\nof Montreal, the Charter of the proposed Canadian Pacific Railway, for\r\na large sum of money, which had been used as a Ministerial Bribery\r\nFund in the preceding General Election. Shortly after this, and before\r\nany decided inquiry had been made into the matter, Parliament was\r\nadjourned (on May 23rd,) until the following 13th of August. The Cartoon\r\nplayfully suggests the feeling of the Opposition, (represented by Hon. A.\r\nMackenzie,) towards the accused ministry during the “vacation.”\r\n\r\n    MAY 31, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 2.\r\n\r\nAFTER THE SESSION; OR, ‘THE SITUATION.’\r\n\r\nJ. A.

The persons\r\nrepresented are, in the centre, Mr. A. Macnab, Police Magistrate of\r\nToronto; on the right, Mr. Nudell, a popular Court official; and on the\r\nleft, Alderman John Baxter, J.P.\r\n\r\n    JUNE 21st, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 4.\r\n\r\nLAW AND JUSTICE.\r\n\r\nA DESIGN RESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED TO THE QUEEN’S PARK STATUE COMMITTEE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 5.\r\n\r\n“_The Huntington Business._”\r\n\r\n\r\n“Sir John courts enquiry” was the oft-repeated assertion of the\r\nConservative newspapers, in view of the approaching session of Parliament\r\nat which the charge brought by Mr. Huntington was to be regularly tried.\r\nThe Cartoon was meant to depict the gallant Knight in his “courtship” in\r\nsuch a way as to render the quoted statement “sorter Ironikal” as A. Ward\r\nwould say.\r\n\r\n    JULY 5, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 5.\r\n\r\nTHE HUNTINGDON BUSINESS.\r\n\r\n“SIR JOHN _COURTS_ ENQUIRY.”—THE _MAIL_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 6.\r\n\r\n“_The Overworked Ma(yo)re._”\r\n\r\n\r\nA palpable and surely a pardonable pun, seeing that its object was to\r\npay a tribute to the official industry of the Civic Chief Magistrate for\r\n1873—Alex. Manning, Esq. A branch of the Society of the Prevention of\r\nCruelty, &c., had been established in the City shortly before the date of\r\nthe cartoon.\r\n\r\n    JULY 12th, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 6.\r\n\r\nAN OVERWORKED MA(YO)RE.\r\n\r\nA FAIR CASE FOR OUR NEWLY-FLEDGED HUMANE SOCIETY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 7.\r\n\r\n“_Canada’s Laocoon._”\r\n\r\n\r\nAn adaptation of the classical story of Laocoon and the serpents to\r\nthe circumstances of some of the parties to what was already known as\r\nthe “Pacific Scandal.” The persons represented are Sir Hugh Allan (to\r\nwhom the charter was sold), Sir John Macdonald (by whom ditto), and Sir\r\nFrancis Hincks. It is due to the latter gentleman to point out that, as\r\nindicated in the cartoon, he was merely _suspected_ of complicity in the\r\nmatter, and most emphatically denied the truth of the allegation of his\r\nguilt, made in some of the newspapers.\r\n\r\n    JULY 19th, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 7.\r\n\r\nCANADA’S “LAOCOON:”\r\n\r\nOR, VIRGIL ON THE POLITICAL SITUATION.\r\n\r\n“Ecce antem gemini a Tenedo tranquilla per alta, &c.”—ÆNEID, BOOK II\r\n(_Freely Translated_)\r\n\r\n    When lo! two snakes (perhaps from the Yankee shore),\r\n    Together trail their folds across the floor,\r\n    With precious scandals reared in front they wind,\r\n    Charge after charge, in long drawn length behind!\r\n    While opposition benches cheer the while,\r\n    And JOHN A. smiles a very ghastly smile!—and—\r\n                            Everybody knows the rest!]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 8.\r\n\r\n“_Will he come to Grief?_”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe legend of this cartoon sufficiently explains its import. The\r\nfacetious occupation of the Clown had its analogue in the course pursued\r\nby _The Globe_ during the “Scandal” excitement—an eager and justifiable\r\ndesire to see the hero of the business unseated.\r\n\r\n    JULY 26th, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 8.\r\n\r\nWILL HE COME TO GRIEF?\r\n\r\nTHE THRILLING ACT NOW IN THE RING OF THE POLITICAL CIRCUS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 9.\r\n\r\n“_Dufferin’s Tormentors._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ministerial party in the House, headed by Sir John Macdonald were\r\nexceedingly anxious for a prorogation of Parliament, the Opposition\r\nas earnestly opposed that course. Their counter entreaties to the\r\nGovernor-General on the subject suggested the familiar scene of the\r\nrailway passenger and his friends the “cabbies.”\r\n\r\n    AUGUST 2nd, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 9.\r\n\r\nDUFFERIN’S TORMENTORS, or “_PER VIAS RECTAS_.”\r\n\r\nJ—N A.

(to represent _The\r\nLeader_), Sir John A. Macdonald, Sir Francis Hincks, “Uncle Sam,” and T.\r\nC. Patteson, Esq. (representing _The Mail_ newspaper.) On Messrs.

The words\r\nimputed to Sir John in the cartoon had been used by him on the floor\r\nof the House, and became a popular by-word while the discussion on the\r\nsubject lasted.\r\n\r\n    AUGUST 16th, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 11.\r\n\r\nWHITHER ARE WE DRIFTING?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 12.\r\n\r\n“_The Beauties of a Royal Commission._”\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Cartoon was intended to satirize the appointment by Sir John A.\r\nMacdonald of a Royal Commission, absolutely under his own control,\r\nto enquire into and report upon the charges brought by the Hon. Mr.\r\nHuntington. The sentiment of the Press and public with regard to this\r\nproceeding justified the implication of the caricature, that the accused\r\nPremier was virtually “trying himself.”\r\n\r\n    AUGUST 23rd, 1873.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: No. 12.\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTIES OF A ROYAL COMMISSION.\r\n\r\n“_WHEN SHALL WE THREE MEET AGAIN?_”]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNO. 13.\r\n\r\n“_Waiting for Huntington._”\r\n\r\n\r\nHon.
