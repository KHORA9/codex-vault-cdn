The time was more than threescore years ago, when York was a\r\nplace of insignificant proportions; when Hamilton could barely be said\r\nto have an existence; and when the sites of most of the other towns of\r\nthe Province whose names are now familiar to us still formed part of the\r\nhunting-grounds of the native Indian. The little town on the frontier\r\nwas relatively a place of much greater importance than it is at present;\r\nthough its fortunes, even at that early period, were decidedly on the\r\nwane, and such glory as it could ever boast of possessing, as the\r\nProvincial capital, had departed from it long before. To speak with\r\nabsolute precision, the date was Friday, the 20th of August, 1819: so\r\nlong ago that, as far as I have been able to learn, there are only two\r\npersons now living who were present on the occasion. The court-room,\r\nwhich was the largest in the Province, was packed to the doors, and\r\nthough every window was thrown open for purposes of ventilation, the\r\natmosphere was almost stifling. Even a stranger, had any such been\r\npresent, could not have failed to perceive that the trial was one in\r\nwhich a keen interest was felt by the spectators, many of whom were\r\nrestless and irritable, insomuch that they found it impossible to keep\r\nperfectly still, and from time to time shifted uneasily in their places.\r\nWhispers, \"not loud, but deep,\" occasionally reverberated from the back\r\nbenches to the quadrangular space in front assigned to gentlemen of the\r\nlong robe, and ascended thence to the august presence upon the judgment\r\nseat. Ever and anon the stentorian voice of the crier proclaimed\r\nsilence, in a tone which plainly signified that endurance had well-nigh\r\nreached its limits, and that he would really be compelled to proceed to\r\nextremities if his mandate were any longer disobeyed.\r\n\r\nThe court-room was of the old conventional pattern. At the upper end was\r\nthe large elevated desk, or throne, extending nearly half way across the\r\nchamber, with spacious cushioned chairs, and other suitable\r\naccommodation for the presiding judge and his associates. To right and\r\nleft were the enclosed jury boxes, with seats raised considerably above\r\nthe level of the floor, but not so high as those provided for the\r\njustices. Directly opposite the throne of justice, and about six yards\r\ndistant therefrom, was the prisoners' dock, into which five or six\r\npersons might have been thrust, at a pinch. The intervening space\r\nenclosed by this quadrangle--throne, prisoners' dock, and jury\r\nboxes--was mainly appropriated to the use of barristers and attorneys,\r\nand their clients. A large portion of the space so appropriated was\r\noccupied by a table, around which were distributed a few chairs, every\r\none of which was occupied; and at the end directly below the judicial\r\nthrone was a small enclosure provided for the clerk of the court, set\r\napart by a low railing, and containing a desk of diminutive size.\r\nBetween the clerk's desk and the left-hand jury box was the witness\r\nstall, raised to a level with the highest seats provided for the jurors.\r\nA seat for the sheriff was placed a short distance to the right of the\r\nthrone of justice, and on a slightly lower level.\r\n\r\nAll these arrangements occupied perhaps one-third of the entire\r\ncourt-room. The rest of the space, extending from the rear of the\r\nprisoners' dock to the lower end of the chamber, was occupied by seats\r\nrising tier behind tier, with a passage down the middle. Between each\r\nof the ends of these seats and the walls of the chamber were passages of\r\nabout three feet in width, leading to the doors, for purposes of\r\n\"ingress, egress and regress.\" Such was the plan of the conventional\r\nUpper Canadian court-room in the olden time; and such, with a few\r\ninconsiderable modifications, many of them remain down to the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThe sole occupant of the judgment seat, on this sultry afternoon, was a\r\ngentleman of somewhat diminutive size, but withal of handsome and\r\nimposing appearance. Though he had reached advanced middle life, he\r\npresented none of the signs of age, and evidently retained all his\r\nvigour unimpaired. His eyes were bright and keen, and his small but firm\r\nand clearly cut features were lighted up with the consciousness of\r\nmental power. No one, looking upon that countenance, could doubt that\r\nits owner had all his faculties under strict and thorough control, or\r\nthat his faculties were considerably above those of average humanity.\r\nThe face was not one for a child to fall in love with, for it was a\r\nperfect index to the character, and was firm and strong rather than\r\namiable or kind. Evidently a man who, should the occasion for doing so\r\narise, would deal out the utmost rigour of the law, if not with\r\nindifference, at least without a qualm. He was the Honourable William\r\nDummer Powell, and he occupied the high office of Chief Justice of the\r\nProvince. In conjunction with the Reverend Doctor Strachan, Rector of\r\nYork, he had for several years practically directed the administration\r\nof affairs in Upper Canada. Francis Gore and Sir Peregrine Maitland\r\nmight successively posture as figure-heads under the title of\r\nLieutenant-Governors, but the real depositaries of power were the Rector\r\nand the Chief Justice. Ominous combination! which falsified the aphorism\r\nof a great writer--now, unhappily, lost to us--about the inevitable\r\nincompatibility of law and gospel. Both of them had seats in the\r\nExecutive Council, and, under the then-existing state of things, were\r\nofficial but irresponsible advisers of the Crown's representative. More\r\nthan one would-be innovator of those days had been made to feel the\r\nweight of their hands, without in the least knowing, or even suspecting,\r\nwhence the blow proceeded. They were the head and front of the junto of\r\noligarchs who formed the Vehmgericht known as the Family Compact, and\r\nfor all practical purposes their judgment in matters relating to the\r\ndispensing of patronage and the disposal of Crown property was final and\r\nconclusive.\r\n\r\nThe counsel for the prosecution was a handsome young man of\r\ntwenty-eight, who for some years past had been steadily fitting himself\r\nfor the important part he was destined to play--that of Mr. Powell's\r\njudicial[1] and political successor in the colony. The time was only ten\r\nyears distant when he, in his turn, was to become Chief Justice of Upper\r\nCanada. The time was still less remote when he was to succeed Chief\r\nJustice Powell as Dr. Strachan's most active colleague--as the chief lay\r\nspokesman of his party, and the chief lay adviser of successive\r\nLieutenant-Governors. His name was John Beverley Robinson, and his\r\ndestiny was doubtless sufficiently clear before him on this 20th of\r\nAugust, 1819. He had strong claims upon his party, for he was the son of\r\na United Empire Loyalist, and during the late war with the United States\r\nhad proved that he was no degenerate scion of the stock whence he had\r\nsprung. He had been present at the surrender of Detroit, and had borne\r\nhimself gallantly at the battle of Queenston Heights. Nor had his party\r\nshown any disposition to ignore his claims. On the contrary, they had\r\npushed him forward with a rapidity which would have turned any head with\r\na natural tendency to giddiness. He had been appointed Attorney-General\r\nof the Province before he had been called to the bar, and when he was\r\nonly twenty-one years of age--a special Act of Parliament being\r\nsubsequently passed to confirm the proceeding. In 1815 he had been\r\nappointed Solicitor-General, chiefly in order that he might draw the\r\nsalary incidental to that office during a two years' visit to England.\r\nSoon after his return he had again been appointed Attorney-General, and\r\nhad early signalized his re-accession to office by his manner of\r\nprosecuting certain criminals from the Red River country, who had been\r\nplaced on trial at York. Those proceedings do not fall within the\r\npurview of this work, but it may be said with reference to the young\r\nAttorney-General's connection with them that he had proved himself an\r\nexceedingly narrow partisan and a docile pupil of Dr. Strachan. He now\r\npresented himself to take a leading part in one of the most shameless\r\nand iniquitous prosecutions that ever disgraced a court of justice. His\r\npersonal appearance was decidedly prepossessing. His figure, clad in\r\nwell-fitting garments of the fashionable cut of the period, was light,\r\nagile and compact, and his face, rather inclining to narrowness, was\r\nsurmounted by a high and smoothly-finished brow, beneath which looked\r\nout a pair of steel-grey eyes, the usual expression of which was eager\r\nand firm, but on the whole not unkindly. His mouth was finely formed,\r\nand when he was in a pleasant humour--as indeed he not infrequently\r\nwas--his smile was sweet and ingratiating. In intellectual capacity he\r\nwas considerably in advance of most of his professional brethren of that\r\nday, and he had cultivated his natural abilities by constant\r\nwatchfulness and study. His features, one and all, were well and sharply\r\ndefined, and he was probably the handsomest man at the Provincial bar.\r\n\r\nSeveral other members of the legal profession, all of them more or less\r\nwidely known in the forensic, judicial or political annals of the\r\nProvince, were present. Conspicuous among them was the brilliant but\r\nunscrupulous Christoper Alexander Hagerman, who had already taken high\r\nrank at the bar, and was destined to be one of the most active and\r\nintolerant directors of the oligarchical policy. Archibald McLean, tall\r\nand lithe of limb, had then been more than four years at the bar, and he\r\nhad already given evidence of the high abilities which were to gain for\r\nhim an honoured seat upon the judicial bench. He had been retained to\r\ndefend two prisoners at the Niagara assizes, and his presence in the\r\ncourt-room was due to this fact. Another figure at the barristers' table\r\nwas Samuel Peters Jarvis, his hands yet red with the blood of young John\r\nRidout, ruthlessly shed by him in a duel two years before, and never to\r\nbe effaced from the tablets of his memory. There, too, sat Henry John\r\nBoulton, a young man of much pretension but mediocre intellect, who had\r\nbeen appointed acting Solicitor-General during the previous year, and\r\nwho united in his own person all the bigotry and narrow selfishness of\r\nthe faction to which he belonged. He, also, had been concerned in the\r\nshedding of young Ridout's blood, having acted as second to the\r\nsurviving principal in that affair. With this exception his past life\r\nhad been uneventful, but his future was fated to be marked by\r\nconsiderable variety of incident, and by actions which even the most\r\nfavourable judgment cannot regard with unmixed complacency.\r\n\r\nThe twelve jurymen sat in their places, in the jury-box to the left of\r\nthe judge. The witnesses summoned on behalf of the Crown were the\r\nHonourable William Dickson and the Honourable William Claus, both of\r\nwhom were members of the Legislative Council of Upper Canada. The former\r\ngentleman was an enterprising Scotchman who had settled in Niagara while\r\nit was yet known as Newark, where he had first kept a general store, and\r\nafterwards practised law and speculation with great pecuniary success.\r\nLike the Jarvis above mentioned, he was disfigured by a red right hand,\r\nhaving shot his man in a duel fought in the autumn of 1808 behind the\r\nUnited States fort on the opposite bank of the river. It is fair to Mr.\r\nDickson, however, to say that he was the challenged party, and that the\r\nduel was in a measure forced upon him by the barbarous usages of society\r\nin those (happily) far-off days. The other witness, Mr. Claus, was at\r\nthe head of the Indian department at Niagara, the abuses in the\r\nadministration whereof were notorious. It was well understood throughout\r\nthe district that Dickson and Claus between them had contrived to make a\r\ntolerably good thing out of the Indians, and that they had been\r\nconcerned in some decidedly shady transactions. If it be true that\r\nHeaven helps those who help themselves, certainly both those gentlemen\r\nwere entitled to look for divine assistance. They possessed and\r\nexercised a wide influence throughout the settlements in the Niagara\r\npeninsula, as well as at the Provincial capital, and were commonly\r\nregarded as being on the high road to great wealth. Two years before the\r\ndate of the trial forming the subject of the present chapter, Dickson\r\nhad purchased the whole of the splendid township of Dumfries, comprising\r\n94,305 acres, at a trifle over a dollar an acre; and he had already\r\nbegun to realize upon his investment. Claus and he occupied seats at the\r\nbarristers' table, in close proximity to the Attorney-General. The\r\nspectators included pretty nearly every prominent resident of the town\r\nof Niagara and its immediate neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nBut the most conspicuous figure in that crowded court-room yet remains\r\nto be considered. It has been mentioned that the prisoners' dock was\r\nlarge enough to hold five or six persons. On this occasion it held but\r\na single, solitary prisoner. A man large and bony, who, when in his\r\nordinary state of health, must have weighed not less than fifteen stone.\r\nJust at present he was very far from being in ordinary health, for\r\nduring the preceding twelvemonth he had undergone sufficient worry and\r\nsuffering to destroy the life of any man of average vitality. After\r\nhaving successfully defended himself through two criminal trials, he had\r\nbeen cast into prison, where he had languished for more than seven\r\nmonths. During his long confinement he had been subjected to a course of\r\ntreatment which would have been highly culpable if meted out to a\r\nconvicted criminal, and which was marked by a malignant cruelty hardly\r\nto be comprehended when the nature of the offence charged against him is\r\nconsidered. His own account of the matter is a plain and simple\r\nnarration of facts, the truth whereof rests upon the clearest and most\r\nindisputable evidence. \"After two months' close confinement,\" he writes,\r\n\"in one of the cells of the jail, my health had begun to suffer, and, on\r\ncomplaint of this, the liberty of walking through the passages and\r\nsitting at the door was granted. This liberty prevented my getting worse\r\nthe four succeeding months, although I never enjoyed a day's health, but\r\nby the power of medicine. At the end of this period I was again locked\r\nup in the cell, cut off from all conversation with my friends, but\r\nthrough a hole in the door, while the jailor or under-sheriff watched\r\nwhat was said, and for some time both my attorney and magistrates of my\r\nacquaintance were denied admission to me. The quarter sessions were held\r\nsoon after this severe and unconstitutional treatment commenced, and on\r\nthese occasions it was the custom and duty of the grand jury to\r\nperambulate the jail, and see that all was right with the prisoners. I\r\nprepared a memorial for their consideration, but on this occasion was\r\nnot visited. I complained to a magistrate through the door, who promised\r\nto mention my case to the chairman of the sessions, but the chairman\r\nhappened to be brother of one of those who had signed my commitment, and\r\nthe court broke up without my obtaining the smallest relief.\r\nExasperation of mind, now joined to the heat of the weather, which was\r\nexcessive, rapidly wasted my health and impaired my faculties. I felt my\r\nmemory sensibly affected, and could not connect my ideas through any\r\nlength of reasoning, but by writing, which many days I was wholly\r\nunfitted for by the violence of continual headache.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a pathos about this plain, unvarnished story that appeals to\r\nevery heart. That a man, no matter what his crimes, should have his\r\nnervous system thus cruelly undermined; that his physical and mental\r\nfaculties should be slowly but surely filched from him in this\r\ndeliberate fashion, is an idea not to be borne with composure by anyone\r\nwhose breast is susceptible to human impulses. But Robert Gourlay was no\r\ngreat criminal. He had engaged in no plot to blow up King, Lords and\r\nCommons. He had been guilty of no treason or felony. He had threatened\r\nno man's life, and taken no man's purse upon the highway. He was by no\r\nmeans the stuff of which great criminals are made. He was not even a\r\nvicious or immoral man. He was an affectionate husband, a fond and\r\nindulgent father. His story, from beginning to end, even when subjected\r\nto the fiercest light that can be thrown upon it, discloses nothing\r\ncruel or revengeful, nothing vile or outrageously wicked, nothing\r\ngrovelling or base, nothing sordid or mean. On the other hand, it\r\ndiscloses a man of many noble and generous impulses; a man with a great\r\nheart in his bosom which could warmly sympathize with the wrongs of his\r\nfellow-creatures; a man in whom was no selfishness or greed; a man of\r\ndecided principles and stainless morals; who was incapable of dishonesty\r\nor cruelty; who had a high sense of human responsibility; who feared his\r\nGod and honoured his King. When we compare his virtuous and honourable,\r\nalbeit turbulent and much misguided life, with that of any one of his\r\nimmediate persecutors, the contrast is mournfully suggestive of Mr.\r\nLowell's antithesis about\r\n\r\n    \"Truth forever on the scaffold; wrong forever on the throne.\"\r\n\r\nTo what, then, was his long and bitter persecution to be attributed? Why\r\nhad he been deprived of his liberty; thrust into a dark and unwholesome\r\ndungeon; refused the benefit of the Habeas Corpus Act; denied his\r\nenlargement upon bail or main-prize; branded as a malefactor of the most\r\ndangerous kind; badgered and tortured to the ruin of his health and his\r\nreason? Merely this: he had imbibed, in advance, the spirit of Mr.\r\nArthur Clennam, and had \"wanted to know.\"[2] He had displayed a\r\npersistent determination to let in the light of day upon the iniquities\r\nand rascalities of public officials. He had denounced the system of\r\npatronage and favouritism in the disposal of the Crown Lands. He had\r\ninveighed against some of the human bloodsuckers of that day, in\r\nlanguage which certainly was not gracious or parliamentary, but which as\r\ncertainly was both forcible and true. He had even ventured to speak in\r\ncontumelious terms of the reverend Rector of York himself, whom he had\r\nstigmatized as \"a lying little fool of a renegade Presbyterian.\" Nay, he\r\nhad advised the sending of commissioners to England to entreat Imperial\r\nattention to colonial grievances. He had been the one man in Upper\r\nCanada possessed of sufficient courage to do and to dare: to lift the\r\nthin and flimsy veil which only half concealed the corruption whereby a\r\nscore of greedy vampires were rapidly enriching themselves at the public\r\ncost. He had dared to hold up to general inspection the baneful effects\r\nof an irresponsible Executive, and of a dominating clique whose one hope\r\nlay in preserving the existing order of things undisturbed. It was for\r\nthis that the Inquisition had wreaked its vengeance upon him; for this\r\nthat the vials of Executive wrath had been poured upon his head; for\r\nthis that his body had been subjugated and his nerves lacerated by more\r\nthan seven months' close imprisonment; for this that he had been \"ruined\r\nin his fortune and overwhelmed in his mind.\" And all these things took\r\nplace in \"this Canada of ours,\" in the year of grace eighteen hundred\r\nand nineteen--barely sixty-six years ago--while the Duke of Richmond was\r\nGovernor-General, and his handsome scapegrace of a son-in-law nominally\r\nadministered the government of the Upper Province.\r\n\r\nWith a view to a clearer understanding of the circumstances which led to\r\nthis most villainous of Canadian State prosecutions, it will be well to\r\nglance at some details of the prisoner's past life.[3]\r\n\r\nRobert Gourlay was the son of a gentleman of considerable fortune--a\r\nretired Writer to the Signet--and was born in the parish of Ceres,\r\nFifeshire, Scotland, in 1778. He received an education suitable to his\r\nsocial position, and while at the University of St. Andrews was the\r\nfellow-student and personal friend of young Thomas Chalmers, who\r\nafterwards became one of the most eloquent pulpit orators of modern\r\ntimes.[4] Robert was the eldest son of his parents, and, being heir to\r\nthe paternal estates, he grew up to manhood with the expectation of one\r\nday succeeding to wealth and station in society. He was put to no\r\nprofession, and after leaving college, devoted himself to no settled\r\npursuit. He was on visiting terms with the resident gentry of his native\r\nshire, and took some interest in local military matters. In 1806 he\r\noffered to take charge of an expedition for the invasion of Paris, being\r\nprobably impelled thereto by the mad attempt of Lord Camelford several\r\nyears before. He was full of energy and robust health, bountiful and\r\ngenerous to the poor of the parish, a practical philanthropist,\r\npossessed of great intelligence and a genuine love for his kind; but\r\nwithal somewhat flighty and erratic, of impetuous temper, deficient in\r\ntact and discretion, and given to revery and theorizing. He was, in\r\nshort, a bundle of contradictions, some of his idiosyncrasies being\r\ndoubtless inherited from his father, who was a generous and high-minded\r\nbut unpractical man. The sire would seem to have been conscious of his\r\nson's weaknesses. \"Robert,\" he was wont to say, \"will hurt himself, but\r\ndo good to others.\" The son studied deeply the economical side of the\r\npauper question, and his researches in this direction brought him into\r\nintimate relations with that eminent writer Mr. Arthur Young,[5] at\r\nwhose suggestion he was appointed to conduct an inquiry into the\r\ncondition of the poor in England. By virtue of this appointment he\r\ntravelled, chiefly on foot, through the most important agricultural\r\ndistricts of the island, after which he was pronounced by competent\r\nauthorities to be the best-informed man in the kingdom respecting the\r\npoor of Great Britain. As I have said elsewhere: \"He was consulted by\r\nmembers of Parliament, political economists, parish overseers, and even\r\nby members of the Cabinet, as to the best means for reforming the poor\r\nlaws, and was always ready to spend himself and his substance for the\r\npublic good.\"[6]\r\n\r\nHaving married and settled down on one of his father's estates, he took\r\nupon himself various offices of public usefulness and philanthropy. His\r\nenterprise and public spirit caused him to be much looked up to by the\r\nyeomanry of Fifeshire, and he soon came to be recognized as the special\r\nchampion of the smaller tenantry at agricultural meetings. At one of\r\nthese meetings he conceived himself to have been discourteously treated\r\nby his neighbour, the Earl of Kellie. The discourtesy does not seem to\r\nhave been of a serious nature, but Mr. Gourlay became irritated to a\r\ndegree altogether disproportionate to the offence. He wrote and\r\npublished a pamphlet, in which Lord Kellie was handled with much\r\nseverity. It was circulated by the author throughout Fifeshire, and\r\nwidely read; and from this time forward he was much given to taking the\r\npublic into his confidence respecting his personal grievances. His\r\nattack on Lord Kellie, however, weakened his popularity, and in 1809,\r\npartly owing to this cause, and partly to his being in temporary\r\nill-health, he accepted a proposal from the Duke of Somerset to become\r\nthe tenant of a farm belonging to his Grace, and situated in the parish\r\nof Wily, in Wiltshire. For a time all went well with him in his new\r\nabode. His farm was a model for the emulation of all the landholders in\r\nthe parish, and his products gained prize after prize at successive\r\nagricultural exhibitions. But Mr. Gourlay was nothing if not critical,\r\nand certain of his surroundings afforded legitimate grounds for\r\nfault-finding. There were many and serious defects in the system of\r\nadministering the poor-laws of Great Britain in those days, and the\r\nadministration in the parish of Wily was attended by some specially\r\nobjectionable features. These erelong became painfully apparent to the\r\nkeen eyes of Mr. Gourlay, who began to agitate for a reform. He went\r\ninto the matter with characteristic earnestness, and, by dint of\r\nconstant speechifying and weekly letters addressed to the local\r\nnewspapers, he soon began to produce an impression. His appetite for\r\nagitation grew by what it fed upon, insomuch that he became a confirmed\r\ngrievance-monger and hunter-up of abuses. The magnates of the county\r\nbegan to look coldly upon him, and even, in some instances, to array\r\nthemselves in open opposition to him. This only tended still further to\r\narouse the native pugnacity of his disposition, and his attacks upon\r\nlocal abuses and those who upheld them became more and more violent.\r\nNow, in all this there can be no doubt that Mr. Gourlay was from first\r\nto last chiefly actuated by genuine philanthropy. He certainly had no\r\nselfish or pecuniary purpose to serve; and indeed it is hard to conceive\r\nof a man less influenced by mercenary motives. His life was passed in a\r\nperpetual war against veritable and undoubted evils; but unfortunately\r\nhis hotheadedness and want of tact prevented him from doing justice to\r\nhimself and his views. He lacked the calm intellect and patient temper\r\nnecessary to the successful fighting of life's stern battle, and had the\r\nunhappy faculty of generally putting himself in the wrong, even when\r\nthere could be no doubt that he had originally been in the right. Some\r\nof his letters to the newspapers were remarkable for nothing but their\r\nindiscretion, violence and bad taste, and he came to be looked upon by\r\nthe landlords of Wiltshire as a visionary and dangerous man. His own\r\nlandlord, the Duke of Somerset, was of this way of thinking, and after\r\nsome remonstrances at second-hand which proved unavailing, his Grace\r\nresolved that this \"pestilent Scotchman\" must be got rid of. A bill in\r\nChancery was filed against him on some pretext or other, with the view\r\nof putting an end to his tenancy. Years of irritating and ruinous\r\nlitigation followed, the ultimate result of which was a decision in Mr.\r\nGourlay's favour. But it was the old story of _Jarndyce_ v. _Jarndyce_.\r\nThe protracted litigation had eaten up the substance of the successful\r\nlitigant, and upon the promulgation of the decree the Wiltshire Radical\r\nwas a ruined man. This would have been a matter of secondary importance\r\nto the heir of a wealthy Fifeshire laird, but unhappily his father had\r\nalso come to the end of his resources. Injudicious speculation and the\r\nmismanagement of an agent, combined with the necessity of placing a\r\nlarge quantity of real estate in the market at an inauspicious time,\r\nwere the causes which led to the bankruptcy of the elder Gourlay, who\r\nwas stripped of his great possessions and left with a bare subsistence.\r\nThe son's prospects of inheriting a fortune were thus at an end, and at\r\nthirty-seven years of age he found himself almost wholly without means,\r\nand with a family of five children and a wife in delicate health\r\ndependent upon him for support. The howl of the wolf began to be audible\r\nto him; distant, as yet, but still gradually drawing nearer. To his\r\nmind, a change of the base of his operations was clearly indicated.\r\n\r\nFive years before this time he had acquired a block of land in the\r\nTownship of Dereham, in the County of Oxford, Upper Canada, where his\r\nwife also owned some property. He now began to cast his eyes anxiously\r\ntowards the setting sun, with a view to the rehabilitation of his broken\r\nfortunes. After weighing the matter carefully, he resolved to cross the\r\nAtlantic and pay a visit to Canada, in order to ascertain whether it\r\nwould be prudent to remove his family thither. He seems to have been\r\nvery deliberate about making up his mind, as he did not set sail from\r\nLiverpool until the month of April, 1817, and did not reach Canada until\r\nearly in June. The country delighted him, more especially the Upper\r\nProvince; but one with so keen an eye for abuses had not far to look\r\nthroughout our fair land in those days for subjects of criticism. Having\r\nmade himself acquainted with some of the most glaring iniquities of the\r\nruling faction, and with the various causes which tended to retard the\r\nprogress of the colony, he began to liberate his mind by written and\r\nspoken utterances such as had not theretofore been heard in the\r\nProvince. The effect of these appeals to popular sentiment was soon\r\napparent. People who had long smarted silently under injustice did not\r\nhesitate to make known their discontent. The disturber of the public\r\ntranquillity continued to speak and write, and he made his presence felt\r\nmore and more from month to month. Having resolved to engage in business\r\nas a land agent, and to set on foot a huge scheme of immigration to\r\nCanada from Great Britain, he went diligently to work to gather specific\r\nand definite information, and to attack one abuse after another. He\r\ntravelled about the country hither and thither, addressed public\r\nmeetings, and wrote letters to all the papers that would publish his\r\nanimadversions. He was in deadly earnest, and put all the energy of his\r\nimpassioned nature into his appeals. In commenting upon the\r\ndelinquencies of public officials he did not mince matters, though I\r\nsearch in vain throughout his voluminous writings for any evidence that\r\nhe was ever guilty of a misstatement, or even an exaggeration. He\r\nregaled his readers and hearers with indubitable facts--facts which, for\r\nthe most part, were easily susceptible of proof, and which were\r\neminently calculated to arouse public indignation against the harpies\r\nwho reaped where they had sowed not, and who gathered where they had not\r\nstrawed.\r\n\r\nThese proceedings, as may readily be believed, rendered him\r\ninexpressibly obnoxious to the Executive, and to the horde of myrmidons\r\nwho held office at their sufferance. But the cup of his transgressions\r\nwas not yet full. His next proceeding filled it to overflowing. He\r\naddressed a series of thirty-one printed questions to prominent persons\r\nin different parts of the Province, asking for topographical and other\r\ninformation. The thirty-first question was so framed that, if truthfully\r\nreplied to, it was certain to elicit facts which would form the\r\ngroundwork of damnifying strictures on the principal abuses of the time.\r\n\"What, in your opinion,\" asked Mr. Gourlay, \"retards the improvement of\r\nyour township in particular, or the Province in general?\" Throughout the\r\nHome District the influence of the Compact was sufficient to prevent any\r\nreplies from being returned to these queries. Elsewhere that influence\r\nwas partial only, and many answers were received from other districts.\r\nThe all but invariable reply to the thirty-first question attributed the\r\nslow development of the country to the Crown and Clergy Reserves. Mr.\r\nGourlay did not attempt to conceal his intention of publishing the\r\nresults of his investigations, and of circulating them all over Great\r\nBritain and Ireland. Having succeeded in arousing a good deal of popular\r\nenthusiasm, he proceeded to strike what he intended to be another\r\ndamaging blow. Owing to his exertions, a convention was held at York,\r\nwhereat he advocated a petition to the Imperial Parliament, praying for\r\nan investigation into the public affairs of Upper Canada. He also\r\nsuggested the sending of deputies to England in support of the petition,\r\nand it is not improbable that such a course would eventually have been\r\nfollowed, but the petitioners were as yet not fully organized, and\r\nbefore any of their plans could be brought to maturity their champion's\r\ncareer of agitation received a sudden and, for the time, an effectual\r\ncheck.\r\n\r\nThe oligarchs had taken alarm. If this man were permitted to go on as he\r\nhad begun, there would soon be an end of the existing order of things,\r\nwhich they had so tremendous an interest in preserving. At any cost, and\r\nby whatever means, he must be suppressed. There must be a general and\r\ndetermined advance against him all along the line.\r\n\r\nThe prime organizer of this most unrighteous crusade is believed to have\r\nbeen the Reverend Dr. John Strachan, Rector of York, member of the\r\nExecutive Council, supreme director of the lay and ecclesiastical policy\r\nof the Church of England in Upper Canada, champion of the Clergy\r\nReserves, and what not. It may seem a thankless task to write in strong\r\ndepreciation of a man who, in his day and generation, was looked up to\r\nwith reverence by a large and influential portion of the community, and\r\nwhose memory is still warmly cherished by not a few. But truth is truth,\r\nand the simple fact of the matter is that Dr. Strachan did more to\r\nstifle freedom and retard progress in Upper Canada than any other man\r\nwhose name figures in our history. His baneful influence made itself\r\nfelt, directly or indirectly, in every one of the public offices.\r\nWherever liberty of thought and expression, whether as affecting things\r\nspiritual or temporal, ventured to lift its head, there, bludgeon in\r\nhand, stood the great Protestant Pope, ready and eager to strike. It may\r\nperhaps be conceded that he acted according to his earnest convictions.\r\nSo, doubtless, did Philip of Spain and Tomas de Torquemada. It is not\r\ngoing too far to say that Dr. Strachan was utterly incapable of seeing\r\nmore than one side of any question involving the interests of himself\r\nand his church. When his cause was a just one, who so fond as he of\r\nappealing to the majesty of the law. When he wished to pervert the law\r\nto his own purposes, who so apt at enjoining a disregard therefor.[7]\r\nThere is abundant reason for believing that he was the original\r\ninstigator of the Gourlay prosecutions. They were at all events carried\r\non by his satellites, and fostered by his fullest concurrence and\r\napproval. Their object was to drive Mr. Gourlay out of the country, and\r\nto this end it would appear that the Compact were prepared to go\r\nwhatever lengths the necessities of the case might require. A criminal\r\nprosecution for libel was set on foot against the doomed victim of\r\nExecutive malevolence, who was arrested and thrown into jail at\r\nKingston, where he lay for some days. The trial took place on the 15th\r\nof August, 1818, when Mr. Attorney-General Robinson put forth the utmost\r\npower of his eloquence to secure a conviction. In vain. The prisoner\r\nconducted his own defence, and so clearly exposed the flimsiness of the\r\nindictment that the prosecution utterly failed. A second arrest on a\r\nsimilar charge resulted in another acquittal at Brockville. It was by\r\nthis time manifest that no jury could be found subservient enough to\r\nbecome blind instruments of oppression. The alleged libel consisted of\r\ntwo paragraphs in a petition to the Prince Regent, drafted by Mr.\r\nGourlay, approved of, printed and published by sixteen residents of\r\nNiagara District, six of whom were magistrates. These paragraphs\r\ncontained a vivid but faithful picture of the abuses existing in the\r\nCrown Lands Department, and it would probably have been difficult to\r\nfind a jury anywhere in Upper Canada, some members whereof had not had\r\npersonal experience of those abuses. Having failed in two attempts to\r\nconvict him of libel, Mr. Gourlay's foes hit on another and more\r\neffectual method of accomplishing his destruction.\r\n\r\nBy a Provincial statute known as the Alien Act, passed in 1804,\r\nauthority was given to certain officials to issue a warrant for the\r\narrest of any person not having been an inhabitant of the Province for\r\nthe preceding six months, who had not taken the oath of allegiance, and\r\nwho had given reason for suspicion that he was \"about to endeavour to\r\nalienate the minds of His Majesty's subjects of this Province from his\r\nperson or government, or in anywise with a seditious intent to disturb\r\nthe tranquillity thereof.\" In case the person so arrested failed to\r\nprove his innocence, he might be notified to depart this Province within\r\na specified time, and if he failed so to depart he was liable to be\r\nimprisoned until he could be formally tried at the general jail\r\ndelivery. If found guilty, upon trial, he was to be adjudged by the\r\ncourt to quit the Province, and if he still proved contumacious he was\r\nto be deemed guilty of felony, and to suffer death as a felon, without\r\nbenefit of clergy. This statute, be it observed, was not passed at\r\nWestminster during the supremacy of the Plantagenets or the Tudors, but\r\nat York, Upper Canada, during the forty-fourth year of the reign of\r\nGeorge the Third. More than one eminent authority has pronounced it an\r\nunconstitutional measure. There was, however, some show of justification\r\nfor it at the time of its enactment, for the Province was then overrun\r\nby disloyal immigrants from Ireland and by republican immigrants from\r\nacross the borders, many of whom tried to stir up discontent among the\r\npeople, and were notoriously in favour of annexation to the United\r\nStates.[8] It was against such persons that the Act had been levelled,\r\nand there had never been any question of attempting to apply it to\r\nanyone else. Now, however, it was pressed into requisition in order to\r\ncompass the ruin of as loyal a subject as could have been found\r\nthroughout the wide expanse of the British Empire; who had resided in\r\nUpper Canada for a continuous period of nearly eighteen months; who was\r\nno more an alien than the King upon the throne; and whose only real\r\noffence was that he would not stand calmly by while rapacious and\r\ndishonest placemen carried on their nefarious practices without protest.\r\n\r\nAmong the various dignitaries authorized to put the law in motion, by\r\nthe issue of a warrant under the Act, were the members of the\r\nLegislative and Executive Councils. William Dickson and William Claus,\r\nas has been seen, were members of the former body; and as such they had\r\npower over the liberty of anyone whose loyalty they thought fit to call\r\nin question. Dickson was a connection by marriage of Mr. Gourlay, and\r\nfor some months after that gentleman's arrival in this Province had gone\r\nheart and hand with him in his schemes of reform. For Mr. Dickson then\r\nhad a grievance of his own, arising out of the partial interdict of\r\nimmigration from the United States which had been adopted after the War\r\nof 1812-15. He was the owner of an immense quantity of uncultivated\r\nland in the Province, including the township of Dumfries already\r\nmentioned, which he was desirous of selling to incoming settlers. The\r\nshutting out of United States immigrants tended to retard the progress\r\nof settlement and the sale of his property. His anger against the\r\nAdministration had been hot and bitter, and he had even gone so far as\r\nto state publicly that he would rather live under the American than\r\nunder the British Government. But he had managed to induce the Assembly\r\nto pass certain resolutions, recognizing the right of subjects of the\r\nUnited States to settle in Upper Canada. The restrictions being relaxed,\r\nhis only cause of hostility to the Administration vanished, and he\r\nceased to clamour against it. His sympathy with Mr. Gourlay's projects\r\nvanished into thin air. Those projects contemplated enquiry and reform.\r\nDickson, having accomplished his own ends, desired no further reform;\r\nand as for enquiry, he had excellent reasons for burking it, as it would\r\nprobably lead to the disclosure of certain reprehensible transactions on\r\nthe part of himself and Claus, the Indian agent. He therefore presented\r\na sudden change of front, and, so far from continuing to act with Mr.\r\nGourlay, he became that unfortunate man's bitterest foe.\r\n\r\nHow far Dickson's enmity was stimulated by cooeperation with the leaders\r\nof the Compact party at York will probably never be known. That there\r\nwas something more than a merely tacit understanding that Mr. Gourlay\r\nwas to be got rid of is beyond question. But before any arrest could be\r\neffected under the Act of 1804 it was necessary that perjured testimony\r\nshould be forthcoming. It was easily provided. On the 18th of December,\r\n1818, a secret consultation took place between Dickson and one Isaac\r\nSwayze, at the former's private abode. Swayze was a resident of the\r\nNiagara District, and the representative of the Fourth Riding of Lincoln\r\nin the Legislative Assembly, but was nevertheless a man of indifferent\r\ncharacter, and so illiterate as to be barely able to write his name.\r\nDuring the Revolutionary War he had been a spy and \"horse-provider\" to\r\nthe loyalist troops. More recently he had been chiefly known as one of\r\nthe most bigoted and unprincipled of the Compact's minor satellites; a\r\nhanger-on who was ever ready to undertake any disreputable work which\r\nthe Executive might have for him to do. He was a smooth-tongued\r\nhypocrite, who made extravagant professions of zeal for religion when he\r\nwas in the society of religious people, but afterwards laughed at their\r\ncredulity for believing him. \"When electioneering,\" said he, \"I pray\r\nwith the Methodists.\" At other times he gained votes by threatening to\r\nbring down upon the electors the vengeance of the Executive, who, he\r\naverred, were specially desirous of having his services in the Assembly.\r\nCorruption can always find apt tools to do its bidding.\r\n\r\n   \"Where'er down Tiber garbage floats, the greedy pike ye see;\r\n   And wheresoe'er such lord is found, such client still will be.\"\r\n\r\nIsaac Swayze was a veritable modern counterpart of the client Marcus,\r\nand when he gained votes by holding his patrons _in terrorem_ over the\r\nheads of the electors, he was merely echoing his ancient prototype:--\r\n\r\n   \"I wait on Appius Claudius, I waited on his sire;\r\n   Let him who works the client wrong beware the patron's ire.\"\r\n\r\nHis employers knew their man, and that he would not stick at a trifle to\r\nkeep their favour. On the day after his secret interview with Dickson he\r\nproved his subordination to authority by committing wilful and\r\ndeliberate perjury. He swore that Mr. Gourlay was an evil-minded and\r\nseditious person, who was endeavouring to raise a rebellion against the\r\ngovernment of Upper Canada; that he, deponent, verily believed that said\r\nGourlay had not been an inhabitant of the Province for six months, and\r\nhad not taken the oath of allegiance.[9]\r\n\r\nOn the strength of this sworn statement, Mr. Gourlay was arrested under\r\nthe Alien Act of 1804, and carried before Dickson and Claus, both of\r\nwhom were specially and personally interested in putting him to silence.\r\nThe examination and hearing before them, which took place on the 21st of\r\nDecember, was a transparent mockery of justice. Dickson, Claus and\r\nSwayze, in common with nearly every one in Upper Canada, well knew that\r\ntheir victim had been resident in the Province for nearly three times\r\nthe period specified in the Act. Dickson had been in constant and\r\nfamiliar intercourse with him for sixteen months. Claus had known him\r\nnearly as long. Swayze had conversed with him at York more than a year\r\nbefore, and had been acquainted with his proceedings from month to\r\nmonth--almost from week to week--during the entire interval. The charge\r\nof being an evil-minded and seditious person was too absurd to be\r\nseriously entertained for a moment by any one who knew Mr. Gourlay as\r\nintimately as Dickson had done for more than eight years.[10] As for his\r\nnot having taken the oath of allegiance, it had never been required of\r\nhim, and he was both able and willing to take it with a clear and honest\r\nconscience. But as matter of fact no one suspected his loyalty, and the\r\ncharge against him was the veriest pretext that malice could invent.\r\nWhen he appeared before his judges, however, Messieurs Dickson and Claus\r\nprofessed to be dissatisfied with his defence, and alleged that his\r\n\"words, actions, conduct and behaviour\" had been such as to promote\r\ndisaffection. They accordingly adjudged that he should leave the\r\nProvince within ten days. A written order, signed by them, enjoining his\r\ndeparture, was delivered to him. \"To have obeyed this order,\" writes Mr.\r\nGourlay,[11] \"would have proved ruinous to the business for which, at\r\ngreat expense, and with much trouble, I had qualified myself. It would\r\nhave been a tacit acknowledgment of guilt, whereof I was unconscious. It\r\nwould have been a surrender of the noblest British right; it would have\r\nbeen holding light my natural allegiance; it would have been a\r\ndeclaration that the Bill of Rights was a Bill of Wrongs. I resolved to\r\nendure any hardship rather than to submit voluntarily.\"\r\n\r\nHe paid a heavy penalty for his disobedience. On the 4th of January,\r\n1819--the third day after the expiration of the period allowed him for\r\ndeparture--Dickson and Claus issued an order of commitment, under which\r\nhe was arrested and lodged in Niagara jail, there to remain until the\r\nnext sitting of the Court of Oyer and Terminer. His pugnacity was by\r\nthis time fully aroused, and he determined to fight his ground inch by\r\ninch. After some delay, he caused himself to be taken before Chief\r\nJustice Powell, at York, under a writ of _habeas corpus_, for the\r\npurpose of being either discharged from custody or admitted to bail. The\r\nargument was heard on the 8th of February, when several persons of\r\nwealth and good social position presented themselves, and offered to\r\nbecome responsible to any amount for his appearance whenever called upon\r\nto stand his trial. The attorney who argued the cause on behalf of the\r\nprisoner presented three affidavits, made respectively by the Honourable\r\nRobert Hamilton, Peter Hamilton, and the prisoner himself, who, in order\r\nto render his position doubly unassailable, had meanwhile taken the oath\r\nof allegiance. In the first affidavit it was deposed that Mr. Gourlay\r\nhad been domiciliated at Queenston for more than nine months, and that\r\nthe deponent verily believed him to be a natural-born subject of Great\r\nBritain. By the second it appeared that deponent had known Mr. Gourlay\r\nin Britain, where he was respected, esteemed, and taken to be a British\r\nsubject; \"and that he is so\"--thus ran the affidavit--\"this deponent\r\nverily believes is notoriously true in this district.\" The prisoner's\r\nown affidavit set forth that he was a British subject; that he had taken\r\nthe oath of allegiance, and that he had been an inhabitant of Upper\r\nCanada for more than a year prior to the date of the warrant first\r\nissued against him. There could hardly have been a clearer case. But the\r\nprisoner's enlargement at this time would have been a triumph for him,\r\nand would have made him a popular idol, which would not have comported\r\nwith the policy of the Unholy Inquisition at the capital. He was\r\nremanded to jail, the Chief Justice indorsing judgment on the writ to\r\nthe effect that the warrant of commitment appeared to be regular, and\r\nthat the Act under which it was issued made no provision for bail or\r\nmain-prize.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Gourlay was first placed in durance at Niagara he was possessed\r\nof robust health, a vigorous frame, a seemingly unconquerable will, and\r\na perfervid enthusiasm for the cause of truth and justice. But his\r\nsufferings during the ensuing six months were of a nature well\r\ncalculated to sap the health of the most robust, to rack the frame of an\r\nathlete, to tame the wildest enthusiasm, and to subjugate the strongest\r\nwill. When we read of what the gentle and erudite John Fisher or the\r\neloquent and upright Sir John Eliot underwent in the Tower for\r\nconscience sake, the heart's blood within us is stirred with righteous\r\nindignation. But we are calmed by the reflection that these things took\r\nplace centuries ago, and in a far-distant country. In the case of Robert\r\nGourlay we can lay no such flattering unction to our souls. His slow\r\ncrucifixion was accomplished in our own land, and at a time well\r\nremembered by many persons now living among us. Some idea of what he\r\npassed through may be derived from his own words already quoted. Further\r\nlight on the subject may be obtained from noting his demeanour when\r\nplaced on trial, as the reader will presently have an opportunity of\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\nFor some months after his incarceration his fine state of health and\r\nexuberant animal spirits kept him from utterly breaking down. His whole\r\nnature was up in arms at the wrongs he had sustained, and his pugnacity\r\nasserted itself as far as his circumstances would admit of. He obtained\r\nthe opinions of eminent English lawyers as to the legal aspect of his\r\ncase. The unanimous opinion of counsel was that his imprisonment was\r\nwholly unjustifiable. Sir Arthur Piggott was clear that Chief Justice\r\nPowell should have discharged the prisoner when brought before him under\r\nthe writ of _habeas corpus_, and that Dickson and Claus were liable to\r\nactions for false imprisonment. This opinion was acted upon, and\r\nproceedings were instituted against the two last-named personages. But\r\nthe contest was too unequal. Each of the defendants obtained an order\r\nfor security for costs, which security the plaintiff, being in\r\nconfinement, and subject to various disabilities, was unable to furnish.\r\nThe actions accordingly lapsed, and Dickson and Claus thus escaped all\r\ncivil liability for their most reprehensible deeds.\r\n\r\nThe thread of the narrative may now be resumed pretty nearly where it\r\nwas dropped a few pages back. It was, as has been said, the 20th of\r\nAugust--nearly a year subsequent to the Kingston trial[12]--when the\r\nprisoner was finally placed in the dock to undergo the semblance,\r\nwithout the reality, of a judicial investigation into his conduct. He\r\nwas himself firmly persuaded that the jury empanelled in his case was a\r\npacked one. We have no means of knowing all the circumstances whereby he\r\nwas led to this conclusion, but the idea is not in itself inherently\r\nimprobable. In those days, and for long after, no man tried in Upper\r\nCanada for anything savouring of radicalism in politics could hope to\r\nreceive fair play. In Gourlay's case there were one or two suspicious\r\nfeatures which, to say the least, require explanation. The custom\r\nordinarily adopted by the sheriff, in selecting jurymen, was to draw\r\nthem in rotation from the various townships in the district. \"In my\r\ncase,\" says Mr. Gourlay, \"it was said that he had varied his course; and\r\nnot this only, but, instead of drawing from a square space of country,\r\nhe chose a line of nearly twenty miles, along which it was well known\r\nthat there were the greatest number of people prejudiced and influenced\r\nagainst me.\"[13] Mr. Gourlay further declares that it was observed by\r\npeople in court that in the glass containing the folded transcripts from\r\nthe jury-list some of the folded papers were distinctly set apart, so as\r\nto admit of their being drawn, apparently with fairness, in the ordinary\r\nmanner. These papers so set apart from the rest, as Mr. Gourlay informs\r\nhis readers, were \"caught hold of\" as the twelve which should decide his\r\nfate. The names of the jurors, which, so far as I am aware, have not\r\nhitherto appeared in print, are worthy of preservation. They were\r\nWilliam Pew, John Grier, William Servos, James B. Jones, Ralfe M. Long,\r\nDavid Bastedo, John C. Ball, John Milton, James Lundy, William Powers,\r\nPeter M. Ball and John Holmes.\r\n\r\nThe personal appearance of the prisoner had undergone a woful change\r\nduring his confinement. Had his own wife seen him at that moment it is\r\ndoubtful whether she would have recognized her lord. Could it be\r\npossible that that frail, tottering, wasted form, and that blanched,\r\nsunken-eyed, imbecile-looking countenance were all that were left of the\r\nonce formidable Robert Gourlay? The sight was one which might have moved\r\nhis bitterest enemy to tears. His clothing, a world too wide for so\r\nshrunken a tenant, hung sloppy and slovenly about him, and it was\r\nremarked by a spectator that he had aged fully ten years during the six\r\nmonths that had elapsed since his journey to York in the previous\r\nFebruary. His limbs seemed too weak to support him where he stood, and\r\nas he leaned with his hands upon the rail in front of him his fingers\r\ntwitched nervously, while his whole frame visibly trembled. The saddest\r\nchange of all had been wrought in his once fine eyes. They were of light\r\ngrey, and their ordinary expression had been more sharp and piercing\r\nthan is commonly found in eyes of that colour. They had been clear and\r\nkeen, and expressive of an active, vigorous brain behind them. At\r\npresent they were wandering, weak and watery, altogether lacking in\r\nlustre or expression. They told their sad tale with piteous brevity. The\r\nbrain was active and vigorous no longer, or, if still active, was so to\r\nno definite purpose. The spark of reason was for the time quenched\r\nwithin him. His oratory and his writings were no longer to be dreaded.\r\nThe man whose large presence had once carried about with it unmistakable\r\nevidences of physical and mental power had been reduced to a physical\r\nand mental wreck. No man in that closely-packed court-room was now more\r\nharmless than he. The Compact had indeed set an indelible mark upon\r\nhim--a mark which he was to carry to his grave, for during the\r\nforty-four years of life that remained to him he was never again the\r\nRobert Gourlay of old, and was subject to periodical seasons of mental\r\naberration.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, as he stood there trembling and distraught, with that sea of\r\nfaces turned upon him, he was not altogether without some glimmering of\r\nreason. He was at least passively conscious, like one in a troubled\r\ndream, of what was going on around him. He realized, in a misty, dazed\r\nsort of fashion that he was on his trial; but, cudgel his memory how he\r\nwould, he could not recall the nature of his alleged offence. The fact\r\nis that, though no stimulant had passed his lips, he was in a state that\r\ncan only be characterized as one of intoxication. We know, on undoubted\r\nauthority, that very emotional persons are sometimes intoxicated by a\r\nplate of soup, and that invalids have become tipsy upon eating their\r\nfirst beefsteak after convalescence. Mr. Gourlay was endowed with an\r\nenthusiastic, exuberant nature, which required to be kept in subjection\r\nby abundant exercise. Up to the time of his imprisonment he had led an\r\nactive out-of-door life, whereby the demon of nervousness within him had\r\nbeen kept at bay. But long-continued confinement in a close cell,\r\ndeprivation of fresh air and suitable exercise, had hindered his\r\nexuberance from finding vent. His mind had been thrown back upon\r\nitself. He had not been permitted to confer with his friends, except\r\nunder such restrictions as made converse intolerable. He had been kept\r\nin such a state of nervous tension that he had had no appetite, and had\r\neaten scarcely any food. His sleep had been broken by mental discomfort,\r\nand he had sometimes lain the whole night through without a minute's\r\nunconsciousness. What wonder that his flesh had sunk away from his\r\nbones, and that his frame had lost its elasticity! For some hours every\r\nday he had lain prostrate on the bed in his cell, in a state of\r\nfeebleness pitiful to behold, unable to speak or move, and hardly able\r\nto breathe. \"One morning,\" he writes, \"while gasping for breath, I\r\nbesought the gaoler to let me have more air, by throwing up the window.\r\n'You are no gentleman,' said he; 'you gave that letter[14] out of the\r\nwindow, and I will come presently to nail it down.' Happily a friend\r\nsoon after called upon me, and through his interference the window was\r\nput up. The brutal gaoler had never before been uncivil to me ... but\r\nthere is a spirit throughout animal nature, brute and human, to oppress\r\nin proportion as opportunity is safe, and the object defenceless. The\r\nwounded stag, and the close prisoner of a Provincial Government,\r\nexperience similar treatment.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe summer heat, as before mentioned, had been excessive. No rain had\r\nfallen for weeks until just before the opening of the assizes, when\r\nthere had been three days of damp, cool weather. During these three days\r\nthe prisoner's strength had rallied wonderfully, and he had been able to\r\nprepare a written defence, as well as a written protest against the\r\nlegality of his trial, in case of a hostile verdict. But the exertion\r\nhad been too much for him in his enfeebled condition, and, as though to\r\nadd to his miseries, the heat had become more intolerable than before.\r\nHe had not known how utterly his nerves were shattered until his case\r\nhad been called for trial, and he had been placed in the prisoners'\r\ndock. Hot and stifling as was the air of the court-room, it was balm\r\nitself when compared with the vitiated element which he had long been\r\nforced to breathe. The stimulus was too great, and he was no longer\r\nmaster of himself. To quote his own words, he became rampant with the\r\nfresh air, and was reduced to imbecility at the very moment when he\r\nspecially needed strength, patience and recollection. Such was his\r\ncondition when Mr. Attorney-General rose from his seat and proceeded to\r\nlay bare the prisoner's unspeakable enormities. It had been determined\r\nthat no attempt should be made to convict him of sedition, and that the\r\nonly charge to be pressed against him should be his refusal to leave the\r\nProvince. The indictment, however, was read and commented upon,\r\ndoubtless for the purpose of influencing the minds of the audience. It\r\ncharged, with wearisome iteration and reiteration, that he, the said\r\nRobert Gourlay, being a seditious and ill-disposed person, and\r\ncontriving and maliciously intending the peace and tranquillity of our\r\nlord the King within the Province of Upper Canada to disquiet and\r\ndisturb, and to excite discontent and sedition among his Majesty's liege\r\nsubjects of this Province--and so forth, and so forth, to the end of the\r\ntedious and tautological chapter. The patriotic and disinterested\r\nconduct of Dickson and Claus, in performing the imperative but\r\nunpleasant duty of committing their personal friend to jail, lest he\r\nshould undermine the loyalty of the people, was commented upon with\r\nperiphrastic eloquence. When the official inquiry was put to the\r\nprisoner: \"How say you, Robert Gourlay, are you guilty or not guilty?\"\r\nhe instinctively replied \"Not guilty.\" Then came the next query: \"Are\r\nyou ready for your trial?\" Ready for his trial, indeed! when his\r\nhelpless condition was apparent to everybody who could catch a glimpse\r\nof his tottering frame and his vacant, expressionless face. The\r\nunmeaning sound which issued from his lips was taken for an affirmative,\r\nand the farce of an impartial investigation proceeded with.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of these proceedings the prisoner stood like one amazed\r\nand confounded; as one who gropes blindly in the dark for what he cannot\r\nfind. From the various hints scattered here and there throughout his\r\nnumerous writings, we are able to form some idea of what he underwent\r\nduring that trying ordeal. His imagination had been rendered more lively\r\nby weakness and prostration of body, and he was so stimulated by the\r\nchange of air from his cell to the court-room that his sensations were\r\nchiefly those of a vague and unreasoning delight--delight at the\r\nprospect of freedom; delight at the prospect of once more enjoying the\r\nluxury of heaven's sunlight unimpeded by the bars of a prison cell; of\r\nrunning rampant through the land, and feeling upon his sunken cheeks the\r\ndeliciously invigorating air of the open fields. His high spirit had\r\nbeen effectually tamed by that rigid, excruciating torture of close\r\nconfinement during the dog days, with no other companion than despair.\r\nBy this time personal liberty and fresh air seemed to him the only\r\nthings greatly to be desired. He was cognizant of a sensation of\r\nthankfulness that his trial had come on at last, even though it should\r\nresult in his banishment. He rejoiced that he should even thus be set at\r\nliberty from his horrible situation.[16] He longed to feel the tide of\r\nhuman life ebbing and flowing around him, and to feel that he himself\r\nwas not a mere drone in the hive. During the progress of the trial,\r\nthough he was oblivious of most that was going on in the court-room,\r\nmemory and fancy were keenly alert, and he rapidly lived over again many\r\nepisodes of his past life. The dead and gone years rose up before him\r\nlike the scenes of a rapidly-shifting panorama, even as the past is said\r\nto arise before the mental vision of those lying on beds of pain, just\r\nbefore the great mystery of the grave is unfolded to their view.\r\nSubjects and scenes long forgotten or seldom remembered presented\r\nthemselves. There was the little Fifeshire school, with its umbrageous\r\nplayground, where he had been a merry laughing lad, and where Dominie\r\nAngus had given him his first taste of ferule and Fotherup. There was\r\nthe patched portrait of Cardinal Beaton, in St. Mary's College, at which\r\nhe and his friend John Dean had been wont to gaze with rapt admiration\r\nin the old days left so far behind. There was that odd adventure among\r\nthe Mendip Hills, during his professional peregrination through\r\nSomersetshire more than a dozen years before, and upon which he could\r\nnot remember that he had bestowed a single thought since his arrival in\r\nCanada. There, too, was the drunken type-setter from Bristol, who had\r\ntaught him the technical marks to be used in making corrections for the\r\npress, and whom he had neither seen nor thought of since the publication\r\nof his pamphlet in which be had portrayed the sufferings of Bet Bennam\r\nand Mary Bacon. Who shall say what other scenes, sad or mirthful,\r\npresented themselves among his \"thick-coming fancies\"? Possibly he\r\nrecalled the high hopes of his boyhood, when he thirsted to better the\r\ncondition of the poor, and was almost persuaded that he had been sent\r\ninto the world expressly to guard their interests against the exactions\r\nof grasping landlords. Visions, too, may have arisen before him of his\r\nbeautiful Wiltshire farm, where the modest daisies peeped above the\r\ngrass, and the joyous lark sang from the meadow; where he had once been\r\nso happy in the companionship of his fond wife and little ones, who at\r\nthis moment waited in longing expectation for tidings from the absent\r\nhusband and father. Perchance also he called to mind, at that crisis,\r\nhis little dead daughter, who had blossomed and faded among the green\r\nglades of Wily, and over whose grave the parson of the parish had\r\nrefused to read the services of the Church.[17] The poor babe had died\r\nunchristened, and under such circumstances the rubric forbade the\r\nsolemnization of funeral rites.\r\n\r\nFrom all such musings he was recalled by the voice of Chief Justice\r\nPowell, demanding if he had aught to say ere the sentence of the court\r\nshould be pronounced upon him. The sentence of the court! For the best\r\npart of two hours he had been wool-gathering, and the words beat upon\r\nhis brain without arousing any just appreciation of their significance.\r\nHe now once more awoke to the fact that he was on his trial, but he\r\ncould not grasp the potentialities of his situation, nor could he for\r\nthe life of him recall the precise nature of the offence with which he\r\nhad been charged. He did, however, realize that the jury had returned a\r\nverdict to the effect that he had been guilty of refusing to leave the\r\nProvince, pursuant to the order served upon him. By a desperate effort\r\nhe managed to rally his senses sufficiently to remember that he had been\r\naccused of being a seditious person, though whether the accusation had\r\nbeen made yesterday, or the day before, or half a century ago, he was\r\nwholly unaware. Turning towards the jury-box, he enquired of the nearest\r\noccupant whether he had been found guilty of sedition. Suddenly it\r\nflashed across him that he had prepared a defence, together with a\r\nwritten protest against the anticipated verdict. But by no mental\r\nexertion of which he was capable could he remember what he had done\r\nwith the defence, nor could he call to mind the word \"protest,\" although\r\nat that moment he had the written one in his pocket. After a moment's\r\nstruggle to remember what he wished to say, he found himself hopelessly\r\nbefogged, and abandoned the attempt. Then, to the amazement of all who\r\nheard him, he burst out into a loud, strident peal of unmeaning,\r\nmaniacal laughter--laughter which had no spice of merriment in it, and\r\nwhich was a mere spontaneous effort of nature to relieve the strain upon\r\nthe shattered nerves. Bench, bar, jury and spectators stared aghast. Such\r\nlaughter sounded not only incongruous, but sinister, ominous. It was\r\nsuggestive of the expiring wail of a lost soul. It was more eloquent\r\nthan any mere words could have been, and spoke with most miraculous\r\norgan. Over more than one heart there crept a sort of premonition that a\r\ndread reckoning must sometime arrive for that day's work: that Eternal\r\nJustice would sooner or later exact a fit penalty for the cruel\r\nperversion of right which was then and there being consummated. It would\r\nbe interesting to know what, at that particular moment, were the\r\ninnermost sensations of William Dickson and William Claus, both of whom\r\nsat within a few feet of their victim, and both of whom had repeatedly\r\nreceived offices of kindness at his hands.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, the miserable man's memory was merely suspended, and he\r\nafterwards recalled with much clearness the thoughts and reflections\r\nwhich passed through his mind during that delirium of more than two\r\nhours. He even remembered the senseless bray of laughter which, to the\r\nsympathetic mind, is not the least impressive feature of that iniquitous\r\ntrial. His overwrought nerves being temporarily relieved by the\r\ncachinnation, he regained for a few minutes some measure of composure\r\nand sanity. With the return of reason came a returning sense of\r\ninjustice and oppression. He made a brief but ineffectual attempt to\r\nargue the matter with the Chief Justice, who informed him that the facts\r\nhad been dealt with by the jury, and that he could be permitted to speak\r\nonly on questions of law. The sentence of the Court was then pronounced.\r\nIt was to the effect that the prisoner must quit the Province within\r\ntwenty-four hours. He was reminded of the risk he would run in the event\r\nof his presuming to disobey, or to return to Upper Canada after his\r\ndeparture therefrom. He would be liable, according to the words of the\r\nAct of 1804, to suffer death as a felon, without benefit of clergy. The\r\nChief Justice finally proceeded to read him a severe lecture upon his\r\npast course since his arrival in Canada, and furthermore to give him\r\nsome excellent advice. He informed him that in this country the law is\r\nsupreme; that no man can be permitted to run counter to it with\r\nimpunity; that those who administer the law should be no respecters of\r\npersons; that justice is even-handed, and metes out impartially to the\r\npoor man and the rich. He advised him to turn his great abilities to\r\npractical account, whereby he would no doubt win happiness and\r\ndistinction. \"Perhaps,\" says George Eliot, \"some of the most terrible\r\nirony of the human lot is to hear a deep truth uttered by lips that have\r\nno right to it.\" Poor Gourlay was conscious of some feeling of this sort\r\nwhen he heard such truths proclaimed from such lips. To his\r\nmorbidly-sensitive nature, such irony seemed an aggravation of all he\r\nhad endured. To think that, after such experiences as had fallen to his\r\nshare, a Family Compact judge should gravely inform him that in Upper\r\nCanada the administrators of the law should be no respecters of persons!\r\nthat justice is even-handed! To think that such an one should presume to\r\nadvise him to become practical, with a view to wealth and happiness! It\r\nwas like the adulterous woman who, on eloping with her paramour, wrote\r\nto her husband enjoining him to be virtuous if he would be happy. The\r\nincongruity struck the prisoner so forcibly that for a moment he was on\r\nthe verge of another explosion of sardonic laughter. Before leaving the\r\ndock he made one last attempt to draw attention to the treatment he had\r\nsustained while in prison. By way of heightening the effect of his\r\nnarration, he informed the Court that his letters had been suppressed by\r\nthe sheriff:[18] that while his enemies had been allowed to fill the\r\nnewspapers with lying diatribes against him, and to prejudice the public\r\nmind in view of his impending trial, his own letters to the Niagara\r\n_Spectator_ had been rigidly withheld from the light of day, and this\r\nby official interference. Chief Justice Powell put the cap-sheaf upon\r\nthe pinnacle of absurdity by informing him that if he chose he might\r\nprosecute the sheriff. Prosecute the sheriff! when he had just been\r\nsentenced by the Chief Justice himself to leave the Province within\r\ntwenty-four hours, and when he was liable to the last penalty of the law\r\nin case of his return to prosecute!\r\n\r\nThe trial was ended, and--blissful thought!--for the ensuing twenty-four\r\nhours he was free to come and go whithersoever he would. He was taken in\r\ncharge by his friends the Hamiltons, and spent the night in their house\r\nat Queenston. Next day--Saturday, the 21st of August--he obeyed the\r\nmandate of the law, and shook from his feet the parched dust of Upper\r\nCanadian soil. His mental condition was far from satisfactory, but he\r\nwould brook no interference with his actions, even from his best\r\nfriends. The feeling uppermost in his bosom was a delicious sense of\r\nbeing at large, with no one to shut the cell door upon him, or otherwise\r\nto control his actions. He felt like one recalled to life. The unhappy\r\nman was well aware that his brain was weak, but he also knew that he was\r\nnot what is ordinarily understood as insane. Like Baldassarre, he\r\ncarried within him that piteous stamp of sanity, the clear consciousness\r\nof shattered faculties. His feebleness was as patent to himself as to\r\nothers. He knew that he was the mere wreck of what he had once been, and\r\nhe knew further that his mental and bodily ruin was due to the triumph\r\nof tyranny and injustice. Still, he was, for the moment, happy. There\r\nwas sunshine in his heart, and gladness in his eye. Having crossed the\r\nNiagara river, he knew that he was beyond the material grasp of those\r\nwhose baneful shadow was nevertheless destined to darken the rest of his\r\nlife. \"I thanked God,\" he writes, several years afterwards, \"as I set my\r\nfirst foot on the American shore, that I trod on a land of freedom. The\r\nflow of animal spirits carried me along for more than two miles in\r\ntriumphant disgust. It carried me beyond my strength, till, staggering\r\nby the side of the road, I sunk down, almost lifeless, among the bushes,\r\nand awoke from my dream to a state of sensibility and horror past all\r\npower of description. If at my trial, and so long after it, I was\r\ncallous to feeling; if I was blind to objects around me, and regardless\r\nof consequences, the scenes I had passed through were now too visible:\r\nmy senses were too keen; my feelings too acute. Before, all was frozen\r\nand rigid; now, extreme relaxation resigned me to the torture of a\r\ndistracted mind, feeble, doubting, and irresolute. In fact, my nervous\r\nsystem had undergone a most violent change; and, to this hour, the\r\neffects are permanent: to this hour, with every effort and every\r\nappliance, my natural tone of health and vigour cannot be regained.\"[19]\r\n\r\nOne of the bitterest reflections which forced itself upon him was that\r\nhe, a man of unimpeachable loyalty, had been banished--\"flung out like a\r\nspoilt jelly,\"[20] under a statute which had been passed to guard\r\nagainst the machinations of aliens and traitors. \"Banishment\" was to him\r\na word replete with repulsive and disgraceful associations. He liked it\r\nno better than did the sweet rose of the Capulets.\r\n\r\n   \"Banished: that one word--_banished_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n   There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,\r\n   In that word's death.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn the 27th of August, precisely a week after the trial above described,\r\na high and mighty English nobleman who was for the time domiciled in\r\nCanada underwent a more terrible experience than ever fell to the lot of\r\nRobert Gourlay. He was travelling at the time through a part of the\r\ncounty of Carleton, and while wandering through the woods, attended by\r\nseveral companions, he found himself exceedingly unwell. His spirits\r\nwere depressed, and he was dominated by what seemed an unaccountable\r\ndread of water. His valet had noticed that for a day or two previously\r\nhe had shrunk from performing his customary ablutions, and had cleaned\r\nhis hands and face by the application of a damp towel. On approaching\r\nwithin a few yards of a forest stream he was seized by violent spasms.\r\nBy a desperate resolution he forced himself to take his seat in a canoe\r\nwhich had been provided, but the little craft had not proceeded many\r\nyards ere he was seized by a fresh paroxysm, and in a frenzied tone\r\nordered the boatman to land him on the nearest bank. The order was\r\npromptly obeyed, and he had no sooner escaped from the boat than he ran\r\nfrantically into the depths of the wood. He was pursued and overtaken by\r\nhis companions, who found him foaming at the mouth and raving mad. They\r\nsecured him until the paroxysm had spent itself, when they conveyed him\r\nto a neighbouring shanty. The sufferer, at his own request, was soon\r\nafter removed to an adjoining barn, where he said he should be more\r\ncomfortable than in the shanty, as it was _further from the water_.\r\nThroughout the rest of the day and ensuing night he was subject to\r\nrepeated returns of the paroxysms, during which he suffered untold\r\nagonies. It was evident to himself and those about him that he was\r\nafflicted by the most terrible of all maladies to which humanity is\r\nsubject--hydrophobia. He had been bitten by a tame fox a few weeks\r\nbefore, and the deadly rabies had ever since been rankling in his\r\nsystem. He realized that he must die, and the instincts of his race--he\r\nwas a remote by-blow of royalty--taught him to make an ending in a\r\nmanner becoming a gentleman. Towards evening he consented to be taken\r\nback to the shanty, where a bed had been prepared for him. Except while\r\nthe paroxysms were upon him, he was perfectly calm and collected, and\r\ngave his last sad directions to a friend who stood by his side. About\r\neight o'clock on the morning of the 28th the death-agony came upon him,\r\nand his excruciating tortures were at an end.\r\n\r\nThus passed away Charles Gordon Lennox, Fourth Duke of Richmond, Earl of\r\nMarch and Baron Settrington in the peerage of England; Duke of Lennox,\r\nEarl of Darnley and Baron Methuen in the peerage of Scotland; Duc\r\nd'Aubigny in France, Governor-General of Canada, lord of Halnaker,\r\nGoodwood and West Hampnett. There was, as has been above hinted, a bar\r\nsinister in his escutcheon, for he was descended from King Charles the\r\nSecond and the fair and frail Frenchwoman Louise Renee de Querouaille,\r\nwho was commonly known among Englishmen of her day as Madam Carwell.\r\nThis lady, who was probably the least bad of the unlicensed prostitutes\r\nof Charles's seraglio at Whitehall, was for her many virtues created\r\nDuchess of Portsmouth. Her descendants, like those of Nell Gwynn and the\r\nrest of that frail sisterhood, are reckoned among the great ones of the\r\nearth. The Duke whose melancholy fate has just been chronicled was the\r\nfather of Lady Sarah, spouse of Sir Peregrine Maitland,\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWas there any connection between these two tragical events: the trial of\r\nRobert Gourlay and the death of the Duke of Richmond? Mr. Gourlay\r\nevidently leaned to the belief that there was.[21] The Duke and his\r\nson-in-law had passed through Niagara during the hot weather of July,\r\nwhile the victim of Family Compact villainy was gradually having his\r\nhealth and reason tortured out of him in the jail at that place. He was\r\nof opinion that the two distinguished visitors should have exercised\r\ntheir prerogative by setting him at liberty. This, of course, was an\r\naltogether unreasonable belief. His Grace was not at all likely to\r\ninterfere in the matter, and as for Sir Peregrine, he was completely in\r\nthe hands of Mr. Gourlay's enemies. The belief, however, is worth\r\nrecording, as exhibiting the extent to which Mr. Gourlay's persecution\r\ncontinued to prey upon his mind, even after the lapse of years, and when\r\nhe was in as good health as he ever regained.\r\n\r\nIt was deemed advisable that Mr. Gourlay's case should be a perpetual\r\nwarning to any and every person who might thereafter dare to tread in\r\nhis venturesome footsteps. Accordingly, as has been seen, he had to\r\ndrink the cup of mortification to the very dregs. And, by way of\r\ndeterring public writers from aiding and abetting any such pestilent\r\ninnovators for the future, it was determined that a notable example\r\nshould be made of the editor of the Niagara _Spectator_, who had dared\r\nto side with the oppressed against the oppressor, and had published some\r\nof Mr. Gourlay's attacks upon the abuses of the time. His name was\r\nBartemus Ferguson, and he had on several occasions manifested his\r\nsympathy with projects of reform. The discipline inflicted upon him was\r\nswift and severe. He was seized while in bed, in the middle of the\r\nnight, a hundred and fifty miles from home, conveyed to jail at Niagara,\r\nand thence to York, where he was detained in prison for some days out of\r\nthe reach of friends to bail him. He was tried for sedition at the\r\nNiagara assizes a day or two before Mr. Gourlay. In order that public\r\njournalists of the present day may note in what comparatively pleasant\r\nplaces their lines have fallen, I transcribe the sentence of the court,\r\nwhich was as follows:--\"Therefore it is considered by the said court\r\nhere that the said Bartemus Ferguson do pay a fine to our said lord the\r\nKing of fifty pounds of lawful money of Upper Canada: That he, the said\r\nBartemus Ferguson, be imprisoned in the common jail of the District of\r\nNiagara for the space of eighteen calendar months, to be computed from\r\nthe eighth day of November, in the sixtieth year of the reign of our\r\nsaid lord the King: that in the course of the first month of the said\r\neighteen months he do stand in the public pillory one hour, between the\r\nhours of ten o'clock in the forenoon and two o'clock in the afternoon:\r\nand that at the expiration of the said imprisonment he do give security\r\nfor his good behaviour for the term of seven years: he the said Bartemus\r\nFerguson in the sum of five hundred pounds, and two sureties in the sum\r\nof two hundred and fifty pounds each; and further, that he, the said\r\nBartemus Ferguson, do remain imprisoned in the said jail until the\r\naforesaid fine be paid and security given.\"\r\n\r\nThe composition for which the editor was thus held to so stern an\r\naccount was a letter written by Mr. Gourlay, and signed by his name,\r\npublished in the _Spectator_ during the editor's absence from home, and\r\nwithout his knowledge. It animadverted pretty sharply on the\r\nAdministration of the day. In the jingling and jangling phraseology of\r\nthe indictment, it was calculated to \"detract, scandalize, and vilify\r\nHis Grace Charles Duke of Richmond, Lennox and Aubigny, Captain-General\r\nand Governor in and over the Provinces of Lower and Upper Canada, Nova\r\nScotia and New Brunswick and their dependencies; and to scandalize and\r\nvilify Sir Peregrine Maitland, Knight Commander of the Most Honourable\r\nMilitary Order of the Bath, His Majesty's Lieutenant-Governor of this\r\nProvince of Upper Canada.\" Certain public officials, not specifically\r\nalluded to by name, were referred to as fools and sycophants. But the\r\nletter did not contain a syllable which was not literally true, and was\r\nmildness itself when compared with letters and articles which are\r\nconstantly published with impunity in newspapers of all shades of\r\npolitical opinion in these present times. It appears that, upon the\r\nhumble and unequivocal submission of the culprit, some of the most\r\nsevere penalties imposed by the court were remitted, and that he was\r\nerelong allowed to resume his business;[22] but all enthusiasm for the\r\npublic good had meanwhile been crushed out of him, and he became one\r\nmore added to the list of subservient tools which the Executive always\r\nmanaged to have at their control. Such were the glories of a free press\r\nin enlightened Upper Canada sixty-six years ago. Such were the \"good old\r\ntimes\" which our grandfathers are never weary of belauding to the echo.\r\nHow bright are the hues of retrospection! But for us of the present\r\ngeneration, let us be thankful to the Giver of all Good that such brave\r\nold times are long past, and that they can never return. Let them go;\r\nbut surely it is too much to expect us to pronounce a benison upon their\r\ndead and departed dry bones.\r\n\r\nEven before the commencement of proceedings against Mr. Gourlay under\r\nthe Alien Act, his conduct had furnished a pretext to those in authority\r\nfor striking a heavy blow against freedom of speech and action. The\r\nholding of conventions, whereat meddlesome persons of the Gourlay stamp\r\nmight air their grievances and agitate for investigations into public\r\nabuses, was a thing not to be tolerated in Upper Canada. Upon the\r\nassembling of the Legislature at York, in October, 1818, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, in his opening Speech, hinted at a law to prevent\r\nthe holding of such meetings; and in the course of the ensuing session a\r\nBill to effect that object was introduced into the Assembly by Mr. Jonas\r\nJones, member for Grenville. The Bill was supported by twelve out of the\r\nthirteen members present, and was speedily passed into law; but, as will\r\nhereafter be seen, it was not destined to a long life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter a brief delay in the State of New York, Mr. Gourlay repaired to\r\nBoston, and thence took ship for Liverpool. On a subsequent page we\r\nshall catch one more brief glimpse of him, but with that exception the\r\npresent work has no further concern with his chequered existence. He\r\nwill be referred to from time to time, but only incidentally, and for\r\npurposes of illustration. Those who may feel sufficient interest in him\r\nto follow his fortunes and misfortunes to the bitter end, will find some\r\naccount of them in the authority quoted below.[23]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Not, however, his _immediate_ judicial successor.

He professed\r\nto be able to indicate the precise spot where the body was buried--which\r\nspot, he declared, was not far from the bottom of his garden. Upon\r\ninvestigation these vainglorious boastings proved to be utterly without\r\nany foundation in fact.\r\n\r\n[10] Dickson had originally made Gourlay's acquaintance in 1810, when he\r\nvisited and spent a week with him at his farm in Wiltshire.

William Hamilton Merritt, to whose\r\nenterprise, more than to that of any other man, we owe the Welland\r\nCanal. It is right to add that most of the subordinate duties of the\r\noffice of sheriff were discharged by an underling, and that Thomas\r\nMerritt may have been personally free from blame in respect of Mr.\r\nGourlay. Assuming him to have been blamable, his son, the Hon. W. H.\r\nMerritt, in after days, did his utmost to atone for it by espousing Mr.\r\nGourlay's cause in the Canadian Assembly, as will be seen by reference\r\nto the Parliamentary debates of 1856, 1857 and 1858.\r\n\r\n[19] _Statistical Account_, Vol. II., pp. 400, 401.\r\n\r\n[20] Ib., p. 401.\r\n\r\n[21] Mr. Gourlay was in error as to the date of the Duke's death. He\r\nrepresents him as \"writhing in agony at the self same hour,\" and as\r\ndying on the same day when he, Mr. Gourlay, crossed over into the United\r\nStates.--_Statistical Account_, vol. 2, p. 401. He was astray by exactly\r\na week. By reference to the precept of the court, I find that Mr.\r\nGourlay's trial took place on the day specified in the text--Friday, the\r\n20th of August. He left the Province on the following day--Saturday, the\r\n21st. The Duke's death took place on Saturday, the 28th.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be as well for me to refer here to a story which seems to\r\nhave obtained some currency, to the effect that the Duke of Richmond's\r\ndeath was due, not to hydrophobia, but to delirium tremens. There is not\r\nthe shadow of truth in the story. The evidence as to the Duke's having\r\nbeen bitten at Sorel by a tame fox; as to his showing the healed wound\r\non his thumb several weeks afterwards; as to his dread of water during\r\nthe day before his death, and as to all the circumstances attending that\r\ntragical event, is as clear as evidence can very well be. Moreover, his\r\nhabits were by no means such as to lead to _mania a potu_. He was a _bon\r\nvivant_, but, so far as I have been able to ascertain, he did not drink\r\nto excess, and was always master of such brains as he possessed. His end\r\nwas one which his family might honestly mourn, and there was little in\r\nhis life, nothing in his death, of which they had any cause to feel\r\nashamed.\r\n\r\n[22] \"Major-General\" D. McLeod, in his \"History of the Canadian\r\nInsurrection,\" p. 75, incorrectly states that Ferguson \"died in jail\r\nfrom extremely cruel usage.\"\r\n\r\n[23] _Canadian Portrait Gallery_, Vol. III., pp. 240-256.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nA BILL OF PARTICULARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of bitter persecution sustained by Mr. Gourlay was really the\r\nfirst remote germ of the Upper Canadian Rebellion. In making this\r\nstatement I would not be understood as asserting that Gourlay was the\r\nfirst person to set himself up in opposition to authority in the\r\nProvince, or even that he was the first victim of Executive tyranny.\r\nThere had been more or less of dissatisfaction at the selfish and\r\none-sided policy of the Administration ever since shortly after the\r\ndeparture of Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe in 1796. Between that date and\r\nMr. Gourlay's arrival in the Province several personages of some local\r\nnote had paid heavy penalties for daring to have opinions of their own.\r\nMr. Wyatt, the Surveyor-General, had been dismissed from office because\r\nhe had presumed to point out certain official irregularities, and\r\nbecause he would not betray the trust reposed in him. Joseph Willcocks\r\nhad been goaded into treason by a long course of persecution. Judge\r\nThorpe had been driven from the country quite as effectually as Mr.\r\nGourlay, for no other reason than that he had persisted in holding up\r\nofficial corruption to the public gaze. But none of these manifestations\r\nof \"the oppressor's wrath, the proud man's contumely,\" had taken so deep\r\na hold upon the public mind as did the case of Mr. Gourlay. The injuries\r\ninflicted upon him had been so cruel, the perversion of justice so vile,\r\nthat the public conscience received a shock from which it did not\r\nrecover during the existing generation. For the first time in Upper\r\nCanada's history signs of an organized Opposition began to appear upon\r\nthe floor of the Assembly. Thenceforward the antagonism between the two\r\nparties grew in intensity from year to year. In process of time the\r\nOpposition frequently became the controlling power in the House. At a\r\nlater stage of its development it divided into two parts. One of these\r\nconstituted the moderate Reform Party of the Province. The other was\r\nmade up of the advanced Radical element, whence emanated the Rebellion\r\nwhich forms the especial subject of the present work. All of which will\r\nhereafter be narrated with greater amplitude of detail.\r\n\r\nIt has been intimated that traces of dissatisfaction began to be\r\napparent soon after Governor Simcoe's time. Upon his demission of\r\nauthority the direction of affairs devolved upon the Honourable Peter\r\nRussell, as senior member of the Executive Council; and that gentleman\r\nhad not been long in authority before murmurs began to be heard about\r\nthe partial and defective administration of the important department of\r\nCrown Lands. There were comparatively few men in the country possessed\r\nof sufficient education and business experience to admit of their being\r\nentrusted with the charge of public affairs; and where all the offices\r\nwere necessarily in the hands of a small number of persons, it was a\r\nforegone conclusion that irregularities should creep in, and that\r\ncliquishness and favouritism should prevail to a greater or less extent.\r\nWhen Lieutenant-Governor Hunter arrived, in 1799, he found that certain\r\nobjectionable practices had become common, and that the foundation had\r\nbeen laid of serious public evils. Greed and favouritism had obtained a\r\nstrong foothold, and scarcely any branch of the public service was\r\nefficiently managed. The sin of covetousness was not confined to\r\nsubordinate officials, but included among its votaries some of the\r\nhighest dignitaries of the Province. It would seem that President\r\nRussell himself had an itching palm, and that his individual interests\r\nwere carefully watched over during his temporary administration of\r\naffairs. Everybody has heard how he made grants of public lands from\r\nhimself to himself,[24] thereby violating one of the most cherished\r\nmaxims of English jurisprudence. Lieutenant-Governor Hunter, in a letter\r\nwritten to a friend in England soon after his arrival at York, refers to\r\nP. R.--by whom Mr. Russell is clearly indicated--as \"an avaricious one.\"\r\nIn a subsequent part of the same epistle he adds: \"So far as depended\r\nupon him [Mr. Russell] he would grant land to the de'il and all his\r\nfamily as good Loyalists, if they would only pay the fees.\" During\r\nGovernor Hunter's own term of office, though there is no evidence of\r\ncorruption or double-dealing on his own part, abuses continued to exist,\r\nand dishonesty too often stared honesty out of countenance. During the\r\n_regime_ of his successor, Commodore Grant, these abuses grew steadily,\r\nboth in number and in bulk; and during Francis Gore's long though\r\ninterrupted administration, they reached a height which called aloud for\r\nredress.\r\n\r\nAnd here it is desirable to enquire into the specific nature of the\r\nmanifold evils which enriched a few at the expense of the many; which\r\nendowed a venal and corrupt clique with a practical monopoly of\r\npolitical and social power; which sowed the deadly seed of factious\r\nstrife, and stemmed the tide of Upper Canadian prosperity.\r\n\r\nTheoretically speaking, the constitution granted to Upper Canada by the\r\nAct of 1791 was not unfairly represented by Lieutenant-Governor Simcoe\r\nas being \"the very image and transcript of that of Great Britain.\"[25]\r\nWe had a Legislative Council, the members whereof were appointed by the\r\nCrown for life. This body bore some resemblance to the British House of\r\nLords. Next, we had a Legislative Assembly, the members whereof were\r\nperiodically elected by the people--or rather by such of the people as\r\npossessed a sufficient property qualification to entitle them to\r\nexercise the franchise; and this property qualification was placed so\r\nlow as almost to constitute universal suffrage.[26] The Assembly\r\ncorresponded to the British House of Commons; and these two\r\nbodies--Council and Assembly--with the Lieutenant-Governor, constituted\r\nthe Provincial Parliament. The last-named functionary of course\r\ncorresponded to the Sovereign of Great Britain. He was appointed by the\r\nCrown, to whom he was solely responsible. He was in no constitutional\r\nsense responsible to either branch of the Legislature, or to both\r\nbranches combined, or to any other cis-Atlantic authority whatsoever.\r\n\r\nWith such substitutes for King, Lords and Commons, Upper Canada might\r\ntherefore be said to possess a pretty close copy of the British\r\nconstitution. But when carried into practice the resemblance failed in a\r\nmatter of the very highest import. The absence of ministerial\r\nresponsibility was an all-comprehending divergence. When a British\r\nministry fails to command the confidence of the electorate, as\r\nrepresented by the House of Commons, resignation must follow. In other\r\nwords, the Government of the day derives its power from the people, to\r\nwhom it is responsible for the manner in which it discharges the trust\r\nreposed in it; and the moment it fails to command public confidence it\r\nmust give way to those who possess such confidence. The test of\r\nconfidence is the vote in the House of Commons. This has been a\r\nrecognized principle of English Parliamentary Government for nearly two\r\nhundred years; in fact, ever since the settlement of the constitution\r\nafter the Revolution of 1688. With us in Upper Canada there was none of\r\nthis ministerial responsibility. We had a ministry, but not a\r\nresponsible ministry. It was manifestly impossible that each member of\r\nthe Legislative Council and Assembly should be consulted as to every\r\nminute detail of the administration. Such a system would be cumbrous,\r\nand altogether impracticable. The actual task of carrying on the\r\nGovernment was therefore, as in England, entrusted to a small body of\r\nmen who, from the nature of their functions, were known as the Executive\r\nCouncil. The members of this body were appointed by the Crown--that is\r\nto say, by the Lieutenant-Governor--at will. It was not necessary that\r\nthey should have seats in either branch of the Legislature, to neither\r\nof which were they in any sense responsible. They were not required to\r\npossess any property or other qualification. In a word, the Crown's\r\nrepresentative was at liberty to select them without any restriction,\r\nand no one in the Province would have had any constitutional right to\r\ncall him to account if he had seen fit to enrol his own valet as an\r\nExecutive Councillor. As matter of fact they were commonly selected from\r\nthe judiciary and other salaried officials, and from the members of the\r\nLegislative Council. Their number was indeterminate, but was seldom less\r\nthan four or more than six, in addition to the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nhimself. Their functions consisted of giving advice to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor on all matters of governmental policy, whenever he\r\nmight deem it expedient to consult them. With respect to mere matters of\r\ndetail, such as appointments to office, he was not supposed to be under\r\nthe necessity of advising with them, nor, according to an opinion long\r\nand ostentatiously proclaimed, was he in these early days under the\r\nsmallest obligation to follow their advice after it had been given.\r\nThis, however, was merely the prescriptive view, and it derived no\r\nsanction from the Constitutional Act itself, which incidentally refers\r\nto the Executive Council as being appointed \"within such Province, for\r\nthe affairs thereof.\" On the other hand, the Executive Councillors\r\nthemselves were not legally or constitutionally responsible to the Upper\r\nCanadian people, either individually or collectively, for any line of\r\npolicy they might inculcate, or for any advice they might give. There\r\nwere no means whereby they could be called to account by the people,\r\neven should they corruptly and openly abuse the trust reposed in them.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to foresee the result of so anomalous a state of\r\nthings, though in this Province, owing to sparsity of population and\r\nother local causes, the result did not immediately become apparent.\r\nSimcoe was a strong-minded, as well as a conscientious man. He had a\r\npolicy of his own for the government of the country, both at large and\r\nin detail, and during his _regime_ he carried out that policy as to him\r\nseemed best. He from time to time went through the form of consulting\r\nwith his Executive Council, but, so far from receiving any impulse from\r\nthem, he invariably carried all before him at the Council Board, and was\r\nthe be-all and end-all of the Administration. He was, in short, a\r\nbeneficent despot, of high and disinterested views, who accomplished\r\nmuch good for Upper Canada, and would doubtless have accomplished more\r\nbut for his too early removal. The moment his all-pervading influence\r\nwas gone, however, the mischief, as has already been seen, began to\r\nwork. President Russell granted public lands to Peter Russell, and\r\nrapidly laid up a store of wealth. Where the head of the public service\r\nwas thus disposed to help himself, we may be sure that subordinate\r\nofficials were not slow to follow his example. Subsequent\r\nLieutenant-Governors were for the most part military men, with little\r\nknowledge of the country's needs, and with a disposition to make their\r\nvoluntary exile as easy and agreeable--and withal as profitable--as\r\nmight be.[27] They naturally turned for counsel and assistance to their\r\nExecutive Councillors, who thus became the dispensers of patronage and\r\nthe supreme power in the State. The Crown's representative was a mere\r\ntool in their hands. Their domination was complete. \"A body of holders\r\nof office thus constituted,\" says Lord Durham,[28] \"without reference to\r\nthe people or their representatives, must in fact, from the very nature\r\nof colonial government, acquire the entire direction of the affairs of\r\nthe Province. A Governor, arriving in a colony in which he almost\r\ninvariably has had no previous acquaintance with the state of parties or\r\nthe character of individuals, is compelled to throw himself almost\r\nentirely upon those whom he finds placed in the position of his official\r\nadvisers. His first acts must necessarily be performed, and his first\r\nappointments made, at their suggestion. And as these first acts and\r\nappointments give a character to his policy, he is generally brought\r\nthereby into immediate collision with the other parties in the country,\r\nand thrown into more complete dependence upon the official party and its\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been the fashion with most writers on our early history to\r\nrepresent the Executive Council as an arbitrary creation of the early\r\nLieutenant-Governors: as an arrangement sanctioned by the Imperial\r\nauthorities, but not authorized by the Provincial constitution. Such\r\nwriters cannot have read the debates which took place in the House of\r\nCommons while the Constitutional Act of 1791 was under discussion there.\r\nNay, they cannot have read the Act itself with much care. Nothing is\r\nmore certain than that the framers of that statute contemplated the\r\ncreation of an Executive Council. By reference to the seventh,\r\nthirty-fourth and thirty-eighth clauses it will be seen that the\r\nExecutive Council is definitely mentioned by name, and that the\r\nappointment of such a body is assumed, and treated as a matter of\r\ncourse. But that the Council should occupy the same relative position as\r\nin Great Britain, and that it should be amenable to public opinion as\r\nexpressed by the vote of the House of Assembly, does not appear to have\r\nbeen clearly understood. Indeed, with the exception of a few master\r\nminds, such as Pitt, Fox, and Burke, but little interest seems to have\r\nbeen taken by British legislators in this important colonial experiment.\r\nParliamentary Government, though it had been long established in\r\nEngland, had not then been reduced to a science. Even such clear-sighted\r\nstatesmen as Pitt and Fox were blind to facts which at the present day\r\nforce themselves upon the attention of every student of constitutional\r\nhistory. What wonder, then, that there should have been defects in the\r\nmeasure of 1791? What wonder that even eminent statesmen should have\r\nattempted to square the circle in politics by introducing such an\r\nincongruity as representative institutions without Executive\r\nresponsibility? Power was given to the popular branch of the Legislature\r\nto pass measures for the public good. But, no matter how overwhelming\r\nmight be the majorities whereby such measures were passed, there was no\r\nobligation on the other branches of the Legislature to accept or act\r\nupon them. In the words of one of our own writers: \"the Legislative\r\nCouncils, nominated by the Crown, held the Legislative Assemblies by the\r\nthroat, kept them prostrate, and paralyzed them.\"[29] As for the members\r\nof the Executive Council, they were to all intents and purposes\r\nindependent of public opinion, and could override a unanimous vote of\r\nthe Assembly without incurring any responsibility whatever. By reference\r\nto the correspondence between successive colonial Governors and the Home\r\nOffice, it appears to have been tacitly recognized by the magnates on\r\nboth sides of the Atlantic that it was unnecessary for a colonial\r\nExecutive to defer to a Parliamentary majority. The right of appointment\r\nto office was considered to be the exclusive prerogative of the\r\nrepresentative of the Sovereign, and it was regarded as a badge of\r\ncolonial dependence that the people should have no voice in such\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been assumed that certain Imperial interests were\r\ninvolved in this great question, and that to give way to the popular\r\ndemand would be to render the colonies free from Imperial control. What\r\nthose particular interests were which required to be protected by so\r\njealous and anomalous a doctrine does not appear to be anywhere\r\nspecified with precision. But nothing is more certain than that\r\nconfusion and chaos must be the inevitable outcome of any attempt to\r\nreduce to practice such opposite principles as are involved in\r\nRepresentative Government and Executive irresponsibility. Such an\r\nattempt in England would very soon produce revolution. Such an attempt\r\nin France did actually produce revolution in 1830, when Charles the\r\nTenth was deposed for his persistent endeavours to maintain an unpopular\r\nministry in power. No country in the world would long continue to\r\ntolerate a Parliamentary system which was free and representative in\r\ntheory, but tyrannous and despotic in practice. Upper Canada was indeed\r\nlong-suffering, but a time arrived when it became evident that there was\r\na limit to her powers of endurance.\r\n\r\nAs the years rolled by, and the country steadily advanced in wealth and\r\npopulation, abuses grew apace.[30] The Executive became rapacious and\r\ntyrannical. Commanding, as they did, the entire administrative and\r\nofficial influence of the Province, they ordered all things according to\r\ntheir own pleasure. They could count upon the support of every member of\r\nthe Legislative Council. Indeed, through their pliant tool, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor for the time being, they controlled the membership\r\nof the latter body, and took care that no man was appointed a\r\nLegislative Councillor unless he was either one of themselves or wholly\r\nsubject to their influence. The Assembly soon found that it was\r\ndeliberately and systematically deprived of the privileges which of\r\nright belonged to it, and that it was little better than a nullity. It\r\nmight meet and go through the form of passing such measures as it saw\r\nfit, but if the measures so passed were not acceptable to the\r\nLegislative and Executive Councils they were contumeliously vetoed when\r\nthey reached the Upper House. This brought the two deliberative branches\r\nof the Legislature into direct and perpetual conflict. The Assembly,\r\nhowever, in early years, was always largely made up of such men as Isaac\r\nSwayze--subservient creatures of the Administration, who opposed their\r\ninfluence to that of the tribunes of the people, and prevented any\r\ncollision between the two Houses from assuming a very serious\r\nconstitutional aspect. It was not till the third decade of the century\r\nthat the conflict assumed such a character as to threaten the\r\nfoundations of the constitution itself; and it was not till the fourth\r\ndecade that any actual attempt was made to subvert those foundations.\r\n\r\nThe Province was about fifteen years old before the inhabitants of Upper\r\nCanada generally began to realize what an intolerable burden they had to\r\nbear in this irresponsible Executive. Before that time some of the\r\nbetter educated and more intelligent among them recognized its existence\r\nas an evil with which they or their descendants would at some future\r\ntime be called upon to deal. But such persons were comparatively few in\r\nnumber, and as the burden did not lie with special heaviness upon their\r\nown backs, they did not feel called upon to involve themselves in what\r\nmight prove a ruinous quarrel with persons who would not tamely submit\r\nto interference. As for the inhabitants generally, they were too busily\r\noccupied in clearing their lands, in hewing out homes for themselves and\r\ntheir families in the vast wilderness, and in reducing the soil to a\r\nstate fit for cultivation, to give themselves much concern about public\r\naffairs. There was no newspaper press to stimulate them to enquiry. The\r\nonly sheet published in the Province which by any license of language\r\ncould be called a regular newspaper was _The Upper Canada Gazette_,\r\nwhich was the official mouthpiece of the Administration. _The Canada\r\nConstellation_, which was a quaint long folio, published at the old\r\ncapital, Niagara, had but a brief existence, and expired during the\r\nvery early years of the century. The _Upper Canada Guardian_, to be\r\nhereafter referred to, did not come into being till 1807. Editorial\r\narticles, except of the briefest and crudest sort, were a still later\r\ndevelopment. The bucolic mind had no intellectual stimulant whatever\r\nexcept such as was to be obtained from contact with other bucolic minds\r\nthrough the medium of conversation. It was no wonder, then, that for the\r\nfirst fifteen years after the creation of Upper Canada, the Provincial\r\nGovernment should have been permitted to do very much as it chose,\r\nwithout being subjected to any formidable criticism on the part of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nThe Legislative Council, as has been said, was composed of members\r\nnominated by the Sovereign's representative. By the sixth section of the\r\nConstitutional Act provision had been made for the creation of a\r\nhereditary nobility, with the hereditary right of being summoned to the\r\nLegislative Council. Happily this authority was not exercised;\r\notherwise, as Gourlay has remarked, \"we should have seen, perhaps, the\r\nDuke of Ontario leading in a cart of hay, my Lord Erie pitching, and Sir\r\nPeter Superior making the rick; or perhaps his Grace might now have been\r\nfiguring as a pettifogging lawyer, his Lordship as a pedlar, and Sir\r\nKnight, as a poor parson, starving on five thousand acres of Clergy\r\nReserves.\"[31] We were spared the spectacle of such absurdities, and\r\nlife members of the Legislative Council were the nearest approach to a\r\nnobility vouchsafed to us. Some of the first appointees were men of\r\nintelligence and probity, but few of those subsequently created could\r\nwith any show of truthfulness be so characterized. They were for the\r\nmost part dependants of the Government, with no fitness, educational or\r\notherwise, for the discharge of grave legislative functions, and with no\r\nmotive but to do the bidding of those who had clothed them with the\r\ndignity of office. All things considered, this condition of things was\r\nto be looked for; but the inevitable result followed. The few upright\r\nmembers either died off in the course of time, and were succeeded by\r\nsycophantic placemen, or, finding themselves outnumbered, ceased to\r\nattend the sittings of the branch of the Legislature to which they\r\nbelonged. In one way and another, those who really wished to preserve\r\nthe public interests were weeded out, and nothing was left but a rump\r\ndevoted to the Executive will. Instead of answering the purpose for\r\nwhich it was originally intended, the Legislative Council became a mere\r\ninstrument in the hands of the oligarchy for stemming back the tide of\r\npublic opinion. Instead of forming a seasonable and wholesome check upon\r\nextravagance and inconsiderate legislation in the Lower House, it\r\ncontributed to the impoverishment of the Provincial revenue by assisting\r\nto keep the control of public affairs in the hands of selfish and\r\nunprincipled men. Instead of preserving the \"happy balance of our\r\nglorious Constitution\"--a phrase constantly placed in the mouths of\r\nLieutenant-Governors, and embodied in their addresses to our Canadian\r\nsimulacrum of the House of Lords--it tended to keep the balance all on\r\none side, and that side was the one most prejudicial to the public good.\r\nIt became a mere stop-gap interposed by the Government between itself\r\nand the Assembly. The Assembly passed measure after measure with careful\r\ndeliberation, only to find that their time had been thrown away, for\r\nupon reaching the Upper House these measures were ignominously thrust\r\naside. One who had himself been a member of the Assembly, and who had\r\nhad personal experience of the evils whereof he wrote, has left the\r\nfollowing description of the manner in which Bills from the Lower\r\nChamber were treated in the Upper: \"Sitting for a short time each day,\r\nthe Bills of the Assembly are despatched under the table with unexampled\r\ncelerity. Deputations, conveying up popular measures, no sooner have\r\ntheir backs turned than the process of strangulation commences. Bills\r\nthat have undergone discussion for days in the other House, and that\r\nhave been amended and perfected with the greatest care, no sooner arrive\r\nin their august presence than their fate is sealed.\"[32] He adds: \"Of\r\nthose who attend to their duties, two-thirds are dependent on the\r\nGovernment for either salaries or pensions. It is not harsh to say that\r\nthey become the willing tools of the hand that feeds them, instead of\r\nlooking to the interests of those from whom they indirectly derive their\r\nsupport. Such gratitude may be very amiable, but it is no qualification\r\nfor an independent legislator.\"[33] These lines were written as late as\r\nthe year 1837, and their author informs us that within the preceding\r\neight years the Council had rejected no fewer than three hundred and\r\ntwenty-five Bills passed by the Assembly, being an average of more than\r\nforty for each session[34]--a statement which is fully confirmed by\r\nreference to the official journals of the respective Houses.\r\n\r\nSuch a method of procedure, leading to inevitable conflicts between the\r\ntwo Houses, caused the public business to be impeded and the public\r\ninterests to be very inefficiently conserved. The whole administrative\r\nsystem of the Province was disorganized. The contest was very unequal,\r\nfor the Government could frequently command a majority of votes in the\r\nAssembly. The minority in that House smarted under a sense of tyranny\r\nand injustice, and felt that they were of no weight in the body politic.\r\nThat sense of dignity which is imparted by a consciousness of\r\ncontributing to the formation of public policy and opinion was wanting.\r\nNot only were the benefits arising from a proper organization of labour\r\naltogether lost, but the antagonism between the two factors in political\r\nlife was so great that they to a large extent neutralized each other.\r\nThe Upper House had no weight with the people; the Lower House had no\r\nweight with the Crown.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest drawbacks to the country's prosperity was the method\r\nof granting public lands. It had been the policy of Governor Simcoe to\r\nencourage immigration from the United States, as well as from Great\r\nBritain and continental Europe. He had offered great inducements, in the\r\nshape of free grants of wild lands, to persons settling in Upper Canada,\r\nand his offer had produced the expected results in the shape of a full\r\ntide of immigrants. He had, however, exercised a rigid personal\r\nsupervision over these grants, and had done his utmost to prevent the\r\nabuse of his bountiful regulations. His successors were less scrupulous,\r\nand being, as has been seen, under the control of greedy and selfish\r\npersons, they permitted the public lands to be used as means of\r\nenriching and corrupting the favourites of the Administration. The\r\nland-granting department was honeycombed by jobbery and corruption.\r\nGrants of five thousand acres were made to each member of the Executive\r\nCouncil, and of twelve hundred acres to each of their children. Similar\r\ngrants were made to certain favoured members of the Legislative Council\r\nand their children.[35] Numerous other personages who could command\r\nsufficient influence at Court obtained grants of twelve hundred acres\r\neach. The extent of an ordinary grant was two hundred acres. From the\r\ncreation of the Province down to 1804 these donations were unattended by\r\nany cost whatever to the grantees beyond trifling fees to the officials\r\nfor their trouble in passing the entries through the office books. The\r\nprivilege of obtaining landed estates for nothing was abused to such an\r\nextent, however, that the Home Office interfered, and in the year last\r\nnamed a scale of fees proportionate to the extent of the grant was\r\nintroduced; but U. E. Loyalists, officers, soldiers, Executive\r\nCouncillors and their children were exempt even from this trifling\r\nburden. In 1818 the performance of certain settlement duties was imposed\r\nupon all persons receiving grants, without any exemptions, and in after\r\nyears several other scales of fees were introduced from time to time.\r\nThe public lands were committed to the care of an official called the\r\nSurveyor-General, and it was not until 1827 that a Commissioner of Crown\r\nLands was appointed. During the first thirty-five years of the\r\nProvince's history grants of land were entirely subject to the\r\ndiscretion of the Governor-in-Council, not merely as to the quantity and\r\nsituation of the land itself, but also as to whether the applicant\r\nshould receive any grant at all.[36] Under such a system it was\r\ninevitable that the grossest partiality should prevail, and it was but\r\nseldom that any one succeeded in obtaining a grant until those in\r\nauthority had satisfied themselves that he was to be relied upon to\r\nuphold any policy which they might see fit to dictate. Official\r\ndignitaries granted lands to their servants and other dependants, and,\r\nas soon as certain requisite forms had been complied with, these lands\r\nwere transferred to themselves or their children. In other cases persons\r\nwere actually hired by the month to draw land and perform the settlement\r\nduties, after which the land was conveyed to their employers. Having the\r\nrun of the official books, these cormorants contrived in one way and\r\nanother to acquire for themselves and their creatures all the best lands\r\nin the Province, either wholly for nothing or at a price which was\r\nmerely nominal. \"The keys of office,\" says a writer already quoted from,\r\n\"were held by themselves or friends, and no admittance to their secrets\r\nwas allowed except to the initiated, whose favourable out-of-door\r\nstatements could be relied on. Never since the Norman invasion of\r\nEngland was there such a wholesale partition of plunder.\"[37] Many\r\npersons owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, entire\r\ntownships.[38] Others owned thousands of acres which they had never\r\nseen. As the taxes imposed on unsettled lands were trifling, these\r\nimmense tracts were no appreciable expense to their owners, who could\r\nhold them from year to year, until the progress of settlement rendered\r\nthem of immense value. Such progress was inevitable, for though these\r\nhuge reservations tended to keep back the country, settlers obtained\r\ngrants of adjoining lands, and their labours could not fail to increase\r\nthe value of all contiguous territory. The Home District, including the\r\nmost valuable portion of Upper Canada, was especially afflicted by these\r\nwholesale reservations, but every part of the Province was more or leas\r\ncrippled by them.\r\n\r\nThe ruling faction and their favourites, not satisfied with the enormous\r\ndirect and indirect grants of lands which they managed in one way and\r\nanother to obtain, availed themselves of every opportunity to buy up\r\nland which had been granted to persons who had expended their little all\r\non their properties, and had thereby become impoverished. Among these\r\nlatter were many half-pay officers and others of good birth but limited\r\nmeans, who had sought homes for themselves in the Canadian wilderness.\r\nNot a few had been compelled to sell their commissions in order to\r\nobtain the wherewithal to settle themselves and their families on the\r\nlands granted to them. Finding themselves cut off from society, and\r\nill-suited to face the privations of pioneer life, they became\r\ndiscouraged, and sold their lands for whatever meagre price they could\r\nget. The land-jobbers were ever on the alert to buy up these tracts at a\r\nfew shillings an acre, not with any intention of settling upon or\r\nimproving them, but solely for the purpose of holding them for an\r\nincreased value. The grants to the children of U. E. Loyalists were the\r\nconstant subjects of bargain and sale, and wrought great evil to the\r\nProvince without producing any corresponding benefit to the recipients.\r\nVery few of the lots so granted were ever occupied by the grantees, most\r\nof whom were young persons of both sexes who resided with their parents,\r\nand had no inclination to set up for themselves in the wilderness. These\r\ngrants were frequently sold at ridiculously low prices. From two to five\r\npounds was an ordinary price for a lot of two hundred acres. Mr. John\r\nRadenhurst, who was Chief Clerk in the office of the Surveyor-General\r\nfor many years, is entitled to speak on this subject with authority. In\r\nhis evidence taken before Lord Durham's Commissioner, in 1838, he states\r\nthat the general price paid by speculators for the two-hundred-acre lots\r\ngranted to sons and daughters of U. E. Loyalists was \"from a gallon of\r\nrum up to perhaps six pounds.\" In answer to another question, he states\r\nthat while millions of acres were granted in this way, the settlement of\r\nthe Province was not advanced, nor the advantage of the grantee secured\r\nin the manner that may be supposed to have been contemplated by\r\nGovernment. He mentions the Honourable Robert Hamilton, a member of the\r\nLegislative Council, and the two Chief Justices, Elmsley and Powell, as\r\namong the largest purchasers of these lands. Mr. Hamilton's acquisitions\r\namounted to about a hundred thousand acres.[39] Elmsley and Powell, in\r\naddition to the five thousand acres which each of them had obtained for\r\nnothing as members of the Executive Council, managed to acquire\r\nquantities of land which, had they been brought together in one spot,\r\nwould have made a township of average size. Thus was monopoly\r\nperpetuated and increased from year to year, and thus were large tracts\r\nof the Provincial territory maintained in a state of primitive\r\nwilderness.\r\n\r\nIntimations of the gigantic abuses existing in the land-granting system\r\nof Upper Canada were more than once sent across the Atlantic to the\r\nColonial Secretary, who instructed the Lieutenant-Governor to impose\r\ncertain regulations with a view to preventing the continuous repetition\r\nof injustice. The Colonial Office, however, was more than three thousand\r\nmiles away, and means were easily found for evading any restrictions\r\nimposed at such a distance. Some idea of the extent which the evil had\r\nattained in the year 1818 may be derived from the two passages in that\r\nvery petition to the Prince Regent for which Mr. Gourlay was indicted at\r\nKingston and Brockville, as related in the preceding chapter. \"The lands\r\nof the Crown in Upper Canada,\" proceeds the petition, \"are of immense\r\nextent, not only stretching far and wide into the wilderness, but\r\nscattered over the Province, and intermixed with private property\r\nalready cultivated. The disposal of this land is left to ministers at\r\nhome, who are palpably ignorant of existing circumstances, and to a\r\ncouncil of men resident in the Province, who, it is believed, have long\r\nconverted the trust reposed in them to purposes of selfishness. The\r\nscandalous abuses in this department came some years ago to such a pitch\r\nof monstrous magnitude that the Home ministers wisely imposed\r\nrestrictions upon the Land Council of Upper Canada. These, however, have\r\nby no means removed the evil; and a system of patronage and favouritism,\r\nin the disposal of the Crown Lands, still exists; altogether destructive\r\nof moral rectitude and virtuous feeling in the management of public\r\naffairs. Corruption, indeed, has reached such a height in this Province\r\nthat it is thought no other part of the British Empire witnesses the\r\nlike, and it is vain to look for improvement until a radical change is\r\neffected. It matters not what characters fill situations of public trust\r\nat present--all sink beneath the dignity of men--become vitiated and\r\nweak, as soon as they are placed within the vortex of destruction.\r\nConfusion on confusion has grown out of this unhappy system; and the\r\nvery lands of the Crown, the giving away of which has created such\r\nmischief and iniquity, have ultimately come to little value from abuse.\r\nThe poor subjects of His Majesty, driven from home by distress, to whom\r\nportions of land are granted, can now find in the grant no benefit; and\r\nLoyalists of the United Empire--the descendants of those who sacrificed\r\ntheir all in America in behalf of British rule--men whose names were\r\nordered on record for their virtuous adherence to your Royal Father--the\r\ndescendants of these men find now no favour in their destined rewards;\r\nnay, these rewards, when granted, have in many cases been rendered worse\r\nthan nothing, for the legal rights in the enjoyment of them have been\r\nheld at nought; their land has been rendered unsaleable, and, in some\r\ncases, only a source of distraction and care. Under this system of\r\ninternal management, and weakened from other evil influences, Upper\r\nCanada now pines in comparative decay; discontent and poverty are\r\nexperienced in a land supremely blessed with the gifts of nature; dread\r\nof arbitrary power wars, here, against the free exercise of reason and\r\nmanly sentiment; laws have been set aside; legislators have come into\r\nderision; and contempt from the mother-country seems fast gathering\r\nstrength to disunite the people of Canada from their friends at home.\"\r\nNotwithstanding these long, involved, awkwardly-constructed sentences,\r\nthere is no more accurate picture to be found anywhere of the effect of\r\nthe pernicious administration of affairs in the Public Lands Office at\r\nYork in 1818. Twenty years later Lord Durham found it not much\r\nimproved.[40]\r\n\r\nAnother hydra-headed monster which ate into the very vitals of the\r\ncommonwealth was the provision for the clergy, known as the Clergy\r\nReserves. This was perhaps the greatest of all the curses imposed upon\r\nUpper Canada by the Constitutional Act, for its ill effects were both\r\ndirect and incidental. It not only tended to stop the march of progress,\r\nbut it created a degree of sectarian animosity and hatred little\r\ncalculated to inspire respect for Christianity in the breasts of the\r\nsecular portion of the community, and it disturbed the public\r\ntranquillity for nearly two generations.\r\n\r\nBy the thirty-sixth section of the Act of 1791, power was given to\r\nreserve out of all future grants of land in Upper and Lower Canada, as\r\nwell as in respect of all past grants, an allotment for the support of\r\n\"a Protestant Clergy.\" It was provided that this allotment should be\r\n\"equal in value to the seventh part of the lands so granted.\" By the\r\nthirty-seventh section, the rents, profits and emoluments arising from\r\nthe lands so appropriated were to be applicable solely to the\r\nmaintenance and support of a Protestant Clergy. By subsequent sections\r\nprovision was made for the erection and endowment by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, under instructions from the Crown, of parsonages or\r\nrectories, one or more in every township or parish, according to the\r\nestablishment of the Church of England, and for the presentation of\r\nincumbents, subject to the bishop's right of institution. By section\r\nforty-two it was enacted that no Provincial statute varying or repealing\r\nthese provisions should receive the royal assent until thirty days after\r\nit had been laid before both Houses of Parliament in Great Britain.\r\nThese famous enactments were destined to produce more discord and\r\nheartburning than all the other clauses of the Constitutional Act\r\ncombined. They were destined to make the Church of England more\r\ncordially detested in this Province by persons without the pale of her\r\ncommunion than she has ever been in any other part of the world. They\r\nwere destined to set one Legislative faction against another in such\r\nfierce array that the public business frequently had to be suspended.\r\nThey were destined to divide the Provincial population into two hostile\r\ncamps, each filled with envy, malice and all uncharitableness towards\r\nthe other. They were destined to be the key-note of general elections,\r\nand to shape the policy of successive Administrations. They were\r\ndestined to be the chief factor in bringing about a Rebellion which for\r\na time seriously disturbed the industries of the Province; which filled\r\nthe Provincial jails with suffering prisoners; which consigned a number\r\nof persons to a premature and ignominous death; which brought sorrow\r\nand ruin to many a once happy fireside; which bequeathed a legacy of\r\nhatred to the children of those who took part in it; and which seriously\r\ndisturbed the international amity between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted whether all the ill effects of these appropriations\r\nwere foreseen by their promoters in the early years of our history. It\r\nwas at all events some time before those effects began to be apparent to\r\nthe people generally. In making the appropriations, care was taken that\r\nthe reserved lands should be intermixed with grants to actual settlers,\r\nwhereby they were spread over a large area; the manifest intention being\r\nto increase their value by their proximity to cultivated farms, and at\r\nthe same time to create a tenantry in the settled townships, with a view\r\nto the creation of parishes and the endowment of rectories. In several\r\nportions of the Province, however, it was impossible to follow this\r\nplan. Much of the Niagara peninsula had been granted to Butler's Rangers\r\nbefore the passing of the Constitutional Act. In like manner, certain\r\ntownships along the north bank of the St. Lawrence, as well as several\r\nportions of the Western District, had been granted to other United\r\nEmpire Loyalists. In none of these cases had any reservations been made,\r\nand the lands had already become vested in the grantees. The\r\nappropriators accordingly set apart large tracts of aggregated\r\nreservations in contiguous townships which were yet unsettled. The\r\nprejudicial results soon began to appear. Huge tracts of reserves\r\ninterposed themselves between one settler and another, enhancing the\r\ndifficulties of communication and transportation, and hindering or\r\naltogether preventing that cooeperation of labour which is essential to\r\nthe prosperity of pioneer settlements. The inhabitants, instead of being\r\ndrawn together, were isolated from one another, and combination for\r\nmunicipal or other public purposes was rendered all but impracticable.\r\nThey were kept remote from a market for the sale of their produce, cut\r\noff from the privileges of public worship and public education for their\r\nchildren; deprived, in a word, of the blessings of civilization.\r\nSettlement was seriously obstructed, and the industrious immigrant was\r\nto a great extent paralyzed by his surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe evils arising out of these Clergy Reserves were intensified by the\r\nunfair and illegal manner in which the appropriations were made. It has\r\nbeen seen that by the Act of 1791 the land reserved for the clergy was\r\nto be equal to one-seventh of all grants made by the Crown. One-seventh\r\nof all grants would obviously be one-eighth of the whole. Yet, instead\r\nof acting on this self-evident proposition, it was the practice of those\r\nto whom the duty of reservation was entrusted to set apart for the\r\nclergy one-seventh of _all_ the land, which was equal to a sixth of the\r\nland granted. The surplus thus unjustly appropriated on behalf of the\r\nclergy had in 1838 footed up to a total of three hundred thousand acres.\r\nThe excess was confined to about two-thirds of the surveyed townships,\r\nfrom which circumstance, as well as from the obvious construction of the\r\nstatute, it is to be inferred that the excessive reservations were made\r\ndeliberately, and not from mere oversight or inadvertence.[41]\r\n\r\nAs the Province increased in population, and as land advanced in value,\r\nthe grievance became more and more manifest. The growl of discontent\r\nbegan to be heard, and the people began to combine against the\r\nintolerable evil. This, at first, was chiefly due to the purely secular\r\nreasons above indicated. By degrees, however, the sectarian element was\r\ndeveloped, and the growl of discontent became a roar of opposition. A\r\ndominant church was not acceptable to the Dissenters[42] who composed\r\nthe bulk of the population; yet it was contended by those in\r\nauthority--all of whom were Episcopalians--that the Clergy Reserves were\r\nthe exclusive domain of the Church of England. It must be conceded that\r\nthere was some ground for this contention, and that the question was not\r\nquite free from doubt. The Act authorizing the setting apart of the\r\nReserves had appropriated them for the maintenance and support of \"a\r\nProtestant Clergy.\" The word \"clergy\" was not commonly applied in those\r\ndays to dissenting ministers of religion. It had never been used in any\r\nEnglish statute to designate any ministers except those of the Church of\r\nRome and the Church of England. The Church of Rome being excluded by the\r\nterm \"Protestant,\" it was contended that the provision had been for the\r\nexclusive benefit of the Church of England, more especially as the\r\ncreation and endowment of parsonages and rectories--which are\r\ninstitutions peculiar to the Church of England--had been expressly\r\nprovided for by the same Act. Such was the plea put forward on behalf of\r\nthe Church of England. Dissenters took a different view. They argued\r\nthat the term \"Protestant Clergy\" had been used in the Act in mere\r\ncontradistinction to the clergy of the Church of Rome. They further\r\nurged that the limited construction sought to be put upon the term by\r\nthe Anglicans was plainly negatived by the thirty-ninth section of the\r\nAct, wherein the words \"incumbent or minister of the Church of England\"\r\nwere expressly employed. Such terms, it was said, would not have been\r\nused by the framers of the Act if they had regarded them as synonymous\r\nwith \"Protestant Clergy,\" as used in other clauses. \"The manifest\r\nintention of the Act,\" said the Dissenters, \"was to provide for a\r\n_Protestant_--as distinguished from a _Roman Catholic_--clergy. The\r\nprovision for the establishment of parsonages and rectories is a mere\r\nmatter of detail, which cannot be allowed to override the larger\r\nintention so plainly evidenced by other sections.\" The Presbyterian\r\nbody took higher ground than their non-Anglican brethren. The Church of\r\nScotland had been expressly recognized as a Protestant Church by the Act\r\nof Union of England and Scotland in 1707. It was therefore contended\r\nthat the ministers of that church were entitled to be considered as\r\n\"Protestant Clergy;\" and this contention was sustained by the English\r\nlaw officers of the Crown in 1819. The opinion expressed by those\r\nlearned officials was acted upon, and the Presbyterians of Upper Canada\r\nput forward claims to a share of the Reserves. Their claims were\r\nallowed; whereupon other Protestant denominations followed their\r\nexample, and demanded, as \"Protestant Clergy,\" to participate in the\r\nprovision made for them. The private and public quarrels which ensued\r\nbetween leaders of the different sects kept the country in a state of\r\nchronic disturbance; while the greed displayed by professed ministers of\r\nreligion furnished a striking practical commentary upon the doctrines\r\ntaught by the Founder of all Christian faiths. Opinions were obtained\r\nfrom eminent lawyers as to the respective rights of the various sects,\r\nand as to the true meaning of the Constitutional Act. The most opposite\r\nconclusions were arrived at by different lawyers, and it became manifest\r\nthat no apportionment satisfactory to all the claimants could be made by\r\nany tribunal. The Church of England meanwhile contrived to secure the\r\ngreat bulk of the spoils. According to a return to the House of Assembly\r\nof lands set apart as glebes in Upper Canada during the forty-six years\r\nfrom 1787 to 1833, it appears that 22,345 acres were so set apart for\r\nthe Clergy of the Church of England, 1160 acres for Ministers of the\r\nKirk of Scotland, 400 for Roman Catholics, and \"none for any other\r\ndenomination of Christians.\"[43]\r\n\r\nBut there was a broader and stronger argument than any of these purely\r\ntechnical contentions: an argument founded on experience and practical\r\nutility. No matter what had been the intent of the original framers of\r\nthe Constitutional Act, the fact had become patent to all Dissenters,\r\nand even to many liberal-minded lay members of the Anglican Church, that\r\nthe Clergy Reserves were a curse to the Province--a mill-stone about her\r\nneck, which dragged her down in spite of all exertions to raise her to\r\nthe surface. Not long after this fact had become generally recognized,\r\nan agitation arose in favour of the total abolition of State aid to\r\nreligious bodies. The plan advocated by Reformers was the sale of the\r\nReserves, and the application of the proceeds to public education and\r\nmunicipal improvements. The agitation was kept up until long after the\r\nperiod covered by this work, and the object sought to be attained by it\r\nwas not fully accomplished until the year 1854. Meanwhile, however, it\r\nwas the most important question before the country, and it occupied the\r\nattention of the Legislature during a large part of almost every\r\nsession. Here was where the conflict between the two Houses was felt\r\nwith most pernicious effect. The advocates of abolition and\r\nsecularization clearly had the country with them, and the Assembly\r\npassed Bill after Bill to effect those objects. Their efforts were\r\nutterly nullified by the Upper House, which would not listen to any such\r\nproposals, and which threw out as many Bills relating to this important\r\nsubject as the Assembly thought proper to send up for its consideration.\r\nSuch were the merits of the long and fiercely-contested question of the\r\nClergy Reserves.\r\n\r\nAnother serious obstacle to Upper Canadian prosperity was the continual\r\ninterference of the Colonial Office in our domestic concerns. Bills\r\npassed by the Provincial Legislature for the regulation of our own\r\ninternal affairs were disallowed with vexatious frequency, and\r\nsometimes, apparently, from mere caprice. Sometimes the irresponsible\r\nExecutive, unwilling that their obedient servants in the Upper House\r\nshould incur popular odium by opposing the will of the Assembly,\r\npermitted Bills to pass both Houses, and then, through their tool the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, had these identical measures disallowed. Advice,\r\nthe compliance with which could not fail to be prejudicial to the\r\ninterests of the colony, was also sent across the Atlantic through the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, to whom it came back by return post in the shape of\r\nImperial instructions to be acted upon. The Colonial Minister, whoever\r\nhe might for the time happen to be, knew little and cared little about\r\nthe British North American colonies, and did not generally concern\r\nhimself with despatches to colonial Governors any further than to sign\r\nhis name to them. He was thus the unconscious means of furthering\r\nExecutive tyranny, and to some extent of alienating the loyalty of the\r\ncolonists.\r\n\r\nAmong other drawbacks, sufficiently serious in themselves and in their\r\nulterior consequences, but of minor importance when compared with the\r\nall-permeating grievances already referred to, may be mentioned the\r\nquartering of military men upon the colony in the capacity of\r\nLieutenant-Governors; the unequal representation of the people in the\r\nAssembly; the exorbitant salaries of certain public officials; the union\r\nof judicial and legislative functions in the same persons; the\r\nappointment of judges, sheriffs, magistrates, and other officials during\r\nthe pleasure of the Executive, and not during good behaviour.\r\n\r\nThe evils attendant upon placing the local administration of the\r\ncolonies in the hands of military officers, who were inexperienced in\r\nconstitutional government, and unfitted by training for such duties as\r\nwere demanded of them, have already been glanced at.[44] Such persons\r\nnaturally enough found themselves altogether out of their proper element\r\nupon their arrival in the colony, and looked to the Executive\r\nCouncillors for advice and instruction. That they should follow the\r\ninstruction received, and that they should surrender themselves to the\r\njudgment of those enemies of the public weal, followed almost as a\r\nmatter of course. In this way the strength of the oligarchy was\r\nconsolidated and enlarged, and its members rendered more and more\r\nindependent of public opinion. All that can be urged on behalf of the\r\nHome Ministry, by way of excuse for committing the direction of our\r\naffairs to such persons, is that the position of Lieutenant-Governor of\r\nUpper Canada was not a sufficient inducement to make it sought after by\r\nreally capable men. The office, in at least one instance to be hereafter\r\nrecorded, went a-begging.\r\n\r\nUnequal representation was a fruitful source of discontent, though Upper\r\nCanada was no worse off in that respect than the mother-country prior to\r\nthe passing of the Reform Bill of 1832. For years before the Rebellion,\r\nthe little district towns of Niagara, Brockville and Cornwall each\r\nenjoyed the privilege of sending a representative to the Assembly. All\r\nthree of them were notoriously rotten boroughs--as rotten as Gatton,\r\nGrampound or Old Sarum--and always returned Tory members prepared to do\r\nthe bidding of the Executive. By such means was the Assembly corrupted,\r\nand the elective franchise turned into an instrument of oppression. Some\r\nof the salaries of public officials were altogether out of proportion\r\nto the state of the revenue, and to the nature and extent of the duties\r\nperformed. Certain highly-paid offices were the merest sinecures, and\r\nhad been created for no other purpose than to provide for serviceable\r\ntools of the Administration. The practice of permitting judges to sit\r\nand vote in the Legislature needs no comment. Whatever justification\r\nthere might have been for such a union of functions in the first infancy\r\nof the Province, when educated men were few in the land, there was\r\ncertainly none in the days when Chief Justice Robinson was Speaker of\r\nthe Legislative Council. The effect of making the tenure of office of\r\njudges and other dignitaries dependent on the will of the Executive was\r\nsuch as has attended upon such a system in all countries where it has\r\nbeen in vogue. The officials were selected almost entirely from one\r\npolitical party, and had always an eye upon the nod of their\r\ntaskmasters, who had the power to make or unmake them. Whenever it was\r\ndesirable, in the supposed interests of the Executive, that the\r\nauthority of the courts should be strained to the perversion of\r\njudgment, the dispensing of even-handed justice was altogether a\r\nsecondary consideration. Mr. Gourlay's case, to say nothing of that of\r\nBartemus Ferguson, affords a sufficient illustration of the extent to\r\nwhich the traditions of the Star Chamber were revived in Upper Canadian\r\npractice, when it was thought desirable to crush a champion of popular\r\nliberty and equal rights.\r\n\r\nSuch were a few of the burdens which the people of Upper Canada were\r\ncompelled to bear in the by-gone epoch when tyranny reigned supreme\r\nthroughout the Province: when\r\n\r\n                       \"the law's delay,\r\n   The insolence of office, and the spurns\r\n   That patient merit of the unworthy takes,\"\r\n\r\nwere the all too frequent portion of such of the inhabitants as dared to\r\ncall in question the righteousness of existing ordinances. There was a\r\nfurther intolerable grievance which was closely bound up with, and\r\nwhich, so to speak, grew out of or sustained all the rest: which\r\ncomprehended within itself all the evils affecting the body politic, and\r\nwhich left traces of its existence that have survived down to the\r\npresent time. This was the Family Compact--a phrase which is in\r\neverybody's mouth, but the significance whereof, I venture to think, is\r\nin general but imperfectly understood. The subject deserves a chapter to\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] Being somewhat doubtful as to the truth of this oft-repeated story,\r\nI have taken the trouble to consult the records in the Crown Lands\r\nOffice, where I find that Mr. Russell on several occasions made grants\r\nof land to himself. Among other such grants I may mention lot number\r\ntwenty-two, in the third concession of the township of York, which was\r\nmade on the 16th of July, 1797. See Liber A., folio 382, Provincial\r\nRegistry Office. He also granted various tracts of land to his sister,\r\nMiss Elizabeth Russell, the first of which bears date the 15th of\r\nDecember, 1796. See Liber B., folio 334. So that the President appears\r\nto have begun to \"do good unto himself\" and his family before he had\r\nbeen three months in office as Administrator of the Government. Further\r\ninvestigation would doubtless prove that he kept up the practice until\r\nthe arrival of Governor Hunter.\r\n\r\n[25] See his speech at the close of the first session of the First\r\nParliament of Upper Canada, on the 15th of October, 1792.\r\n\r\n[26] The property qualification for a voter was, in counties, the\r\npossession of lands or tenements of the yearly value of forty shillings\r\nsterling or upwards, over and above all rents and charges; and in towns\r\nor townships, the possession of a dwelling house and lot of the yearly\r\nvalue of five pounds sterling or upwards, or the having been a resident\r\nfor twelve months, and the having paid a year's rent at the rate of ten\r\npounds sterling or upwards. See the twentieth section of the\r\nConstitutional Act.\r\n\r\n[27] The latter part of this clause has no application to Brock, who was\r\nmade of manlier stuff. Brock, however, was not Lieutenant-Governor, but\r\nmerely Provisional Administrator of the Province.\r\n\r\n[28] _Report on the Affairs of British North America_, English folio\r\nedition, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[29] _The Constitutional History of Canada_, by Samuel James Watson,\r\nVol. I., p. 128.\r\n\r\n[30] The abuses specified in the present chapter were not confined to\r\nUpper Canada. They existed, with certain local variations, throughout\r\nall the British North American colonies, and produced similar results in\r\neach; viz., ever-recurring conflicts between the Executive and the\r\npopular branch of the Legislature, followed by more or less alienation\r\nof loyalty to the mother country on the part of the more radical element\r\nin the community. In the Maritime Provinces the alienation was not\r\nsufficiently widespread to manifest itself in actual rebellion, though\r\nthe conflict between the oligarchy and the popular tribunes sometimes\r\nproduced a very disturbed state of feeling. In Lower Canada, where the\r\nelement of race-hatred was added to all other sources of disturbance,\r\nthe conflict attained an intensity far beyond what was reached in any of\r\nthe other colonies, and left traces behind it which are not even yet\r\nwholly obliterated.\r\n\r\n[31] _Statistical Account_, Vol. II., p. 296.\r\n\r\n[32] _Canadiana_, by W. B. Wells, p. 103.\r\n\r\n[33] Ib.\r\n\r\n[34] Ib., p. 104.\r\n\r\n[35] These grants of five thousand acres to members of the Executive\r\nCouncil were in direct violation of the instructions framed by the Home\r\nGovernment for the regulation of land-granting in Upper Canada. They\r\ncontinued to be made down to 1807, when they were stopped by a\r\nperemptory order to that effect from the Colonial Secretary. There is\r\none instance on record of a reserve being applied for and made on behalf\r\nof the child of a member of the Legislative Council, though the child\r\nwas not three days old. See the evidence of John Radenhurst, Chief Clerk\r\nin the office of the Surveyor-General, in Appendix B. to Lord Durham's\r\n_Report on the Affairs of British North America_.\r\n\r\n[36] Most of these facts with reference to the granting of public lands\r\nmay be obtained from the archives of the Crown Lands Office in Toronto,\r\nand from the newspapers and official reports of the period. They may\r\nalso be found, together with a vast accumulation of other important\r\nfacts bearing on the same subject, in Charles Buller's Report on Public\r\nLands and Emigration, forming Appendix B. to Lord Durham's _Report on\r\nthe Affairs of British North America_.\r\n\r\n[37] _Canadiana_, p. 130.\r\n\r\n[38] In 1796 or thereabouts the Executive offered to grant entire\r\ntownships to persons who would undertake to settle them with a certain\r\nnumber of colonists within a specified time. The number of colonists\r\nrequired was made proportionate to the extent of territory to be\r\nsettled. This offer was taken advantage of by ten different individuals.\r\nThe grants were not actually made, but the respective townships were\r\nallocated in the official books to the various persons concerned. Upon\r\nthe faith of the pledge of the Executive, several of the ten assignees\r\nproceeded to carry out the conditions imposed. Among them was Mr.\r\nWilliam Berczy, who, having obtained an assignment of the township of\r\nMarkham, went to great expense in bringing over a number of German\r\nfamilies, whom he settled according to the conditions of the\r\ncontemplated grant. After he had spent a sum of money variously stated\r\nat from twenty to thirty thousand pounds sterling, the Executive coolly\r\nannounced that they had determined to abandon the township system, and\r\nthat they did not even intend to carry out the grants to those who had\r\ncomplied with the conditions. The compensation offered for this\r\nunparalleled breach of faith was a grant of twelve hundred acres to each\r\nassignee. Nine of the individuals concerned assented to those terms, but\r\nMr. Berczy refused to accept any such inadequate recompense, and he\r\nremained for the rest of his life a ruined man. He shook the dust of\r\nUpper Canada from his feet, and took up his abode in Montreal, whence he\r\nsubsequently repaired to New York, where he died in the year 1813.\r\n\r\n[39] See Appendix B. to Lord Durham's _Report_, folio edition, p. 99.\r\nMr. Charles Rankin, Deputy-Surveyor in the Western District, in his\r\nevidence before the Commission (_ib._ pp. 120, 121), says:--\"The system\r\nof making large grants to individuals who had no intention of settling\r\nthem has tended to retard the prosperity of the colony by separating the\r\nactual settlers, and rendering it so much more difficult, and in some\r\ncases impossible, for them to make the necessary roads. It has also made\r\nthe markets more distant and more precarious. To such an extent have\r\nthese difficulties been experienced as to occasion the abandonment of\r\nsettlements which had been formed. I may mention, as an instance of\r\nthis, the township of Rama, where after a trial of three years, the\r\nsettlers were compelled to abandon their improvements. It should be\r\nnoticed that the settlers in this instance were not of a class fitted to\r\nencounter the privations of the wilderness, being half-pay officers. In\r\nthe township of St. Vincent almost all the most valuable settlers have\r\nleft their farms from the same cause, the townships of Nottawasaga and\r\nCollingwood, the whole of the land in which had been granted, and which\r\nare almost entirely unsettled (Collingwood, I believe, has only one\r\nsettler), intervening between them and the settled township, and\r\nrendering communication impossible. There have been numerous instances\r\nin which, though the settlement has not been altogether abandoned, the\r\nmost valuable settlers, after unavailing struggles of several years with\r\nthe difficulties which I have described, have left their farms.\" This\r\nwitness further states his belief that nine-tenths of the lands in the\r\nWestern District were still--in 1838--in a state of wilderness.\r\n\r\n[40] See his _Report, passim_; also see the portion of Appendix B.\r\nrelating to Upper Canada.\r\n\r\n[41] See the Special Report of Mr. R. Davies Hanson, Assistant\r\nCommissioner of Crown Lands and Emigration, forming the commencement of\r\nAppendix A. to Lord Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North\r\nAmerica_.\r\n\r\n[42] I use this word for want of a better, though it is not strictly\r\naccurate as applied to Upper Canada, where there were no clearly\r\nprescribed standards of religious faith from which non-supporters of\r\nEpiscopacy could be said to dissent. The word \"Nonconformist\" is\r\nobjectionable for a similar reason.\r\n\r\n[43] See _Seventh Grievance Committee's Report_, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[44] _Ante_, p. 51.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY COMPACT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat was the nature and origin of this powerful organization--this\r\ninformally-constituted league, the name whereof has been familiar to the\r\nears of Upper Canadians during the whole, or nearly the whole, of the\r\npresent century; which is referred to in nearly all books dealing with\r\nthe political and social life of this Province before the Union of 1841;\r\nwhich for forty years regulated the public policy of the colony, and\r\nruled with an iron hand over the liberties of the inhabitants?\r\n\r\nImmediately after the ratification of the Treaty of Paris, in 1763,\r\nwhereby Canada was ceded by France to Great Britain, it became necessary\r\nfor the British Government to appoint a considerable number of officials\r\nto fill the public offices in the country so ceded. It did not suit the\r\npolicy of the conquerors to leave much power in the hands of the\r\nconquered. The introduction of the English language and laws was\r\nmoreover a practical disqualification for most of the native inhabitants\r\nof the colony, and the new officials were nearly all sent over from\r\nEngland. Some of the principal personages among them were men of probity\r\nand brains. Others, though possessed of a full share of brains, had but\r\na younger brother's portion of the other commodity. The underlings,\r\ngenerally speaking, had but a slender allowance of either. They were for\r\nthe most part appointed on the recommendation of various supporters of\r\nthe Government of the day, who were thus able to provide for a number of\r\ntheir needy relatives and dependants--a matter of vastly greater\r\nimportance in their eyes than the proper administration of the affairs\r\nof a distant and newly-acquired colony. The Conquest thus proved a boon\r\nto many servile hangers-on of public men in Great Britain, and scores of\r\nthe waifs and strays of British aristocracy began to turn their eyes\r\ntowards Canada as a possible resource in the last emergency. It was said\r\nto be a cold and comfortless land, but it was surely preferable to the\r\nFleet Prison or the Marshalsea, with the alternative of starvation or\r\nenlistment in the army. Many of these pimps and panders to the whims or\r\nthe passions of those in high station found their way to Quebec and\r\nMontreal, and were provided for at the public expense by being installed\r\nin places of greater or less emolument.[45]\r\n\r\nWhen Upper Canada was set apart as a separate Province, in 1791, the\r\nfield of operations was considerably extended. Indeed, the Upper\r\nProvince soon came to be regarded with special favour by intending\r\naspirants to office, as it was in all respects an English colony;\r\nwhereas Lower Canada, in spite of all attempts to Anglicize it, remained\r\nmuch more French than English. Lower Canada, indeed, remained in some\r\nrespects more French than any other part of the world, not even\r\nexcepting France itself, for in that country the Great Revolution had\r\nswept away many effete institutions which were still retained in all\r\ntheir decrepitude among the Frenchmen of the New World. Now, the French\r\nCanadians, though most of the avenues to power and office were closed to\r\nthem, composed a vast majority of the population. They did not take\r\nkindly to the British colonists, and declined to fraternize with them.\r\nThe latter could bear this isolation, as they were comforted by the\r\nspoils of office, but their lives were rendered much less agreeable than\r\nthey would have been in a colony where no such disturbing elements were\r\nknown. Upper Canada was precisely such a colony. No part of Britain was\r\nmore British in sentiment. In no part of the world would an expatriated\r\nEnglishman find himself more entirely in harmony with his environment,\r\nfrom a purely patriotic point of view. What wonder, then, that Upper\r\nCanada was regarded by place-hunting emigrants from England with\r\nwistful eyes? What wonder that an appointment to a public office in\r\nUpper Canada should have been regarded by such persons as a thing\r\ngreatly to be coveted? Such aspirants were regarded with but little\r\nfavour by Governor Simcoe. His great object was to launch the Province\r\nsuccessfully on its career, and to lay the foundations of good\r\ngovernment. He brought with him his own staff, selected by himself with\r\na single eye to their fitness for the positions which they were\r\nrespectively intended to fill. During his day there was little or no\r\nfavouritism in public appointments, and but little, if anything, to find\r\nfault with in the conduct of the administration. His demission of office\r\nwas almost immediately followed by a relaxation of discipline, and by a\r\nlooseness in the management of the public business. As the years passed\r\nby, the Province became the resort of numerous office-seekers from\r\nbeyond sea--half-pay officers and scions of good English, Scotch and\r\nIrish families, who sought to better their fortunes by expatriation. As\r\nthey were, generally speaking, men of some education, and of manners\r\nmore polished than were ordinarily found among the colonists, they\r\nnaturally assimilated, and were drawn towards each other. They likewise\r\ncoalesced, to some extent, with a few United Empire Loyalist families of\r\nexclusive pretensions, in whose veins the blood was supposed to possess\r\nan exceptionally cerulean tint. Several persons who had rapidly gained\r\nwealth by trade and speculation, and who had thereby acquired influence\r\nin the community, were also admitted. In an inconceivably short space of\r\ntime this union of several influential cliques was followed by important\r\nresults. They acquired a strength and influence which, in the then\r\nprimitive state of the colony, carried all before them. They wormed\r\nthemselves into all the more important offices, directed the Councils of\r\nthe Sovereign's representative, and, in a word, became the power behind\r\nthe Throne. In the early years of their domination they organized their\r\nforces with much tact and judgment, and did not develop their plans\r\nuntil they had been carefully matured. They may be said to have\r\npractically absorbed the Executive and Legislative Councils, as those\r\nbodies were entirely made up of persons either selected from among them\r\nor entirely subservient to their influence. No man, whatever his\r\nabilities, could hope to succeed in any profession or calling in Upper\r\nCanada if he dared to declare himself in opposition to them. A few made\r\nthe attempt, and failed most signally.\r\n\r\nSuch was the Family Compact. \"For a long time,\" says Lord Durham,[46]\r\nwriting in 1838, \"this body of men, receiving at times accessions to its\r\nmembers, possessed almost all the highest public offices, by means of\r\nwhich, and of its influence in the Executive Council, it wielded all the\r\npowers of Government; it maintained influence in the Legislature by\r\nmeans of its predominance in the Legislative Council; and it disposed of\r\nthe large number of petty posts which are in the patronage of the\r\nGovernment all over the Province. Successive Governors, as they came in\r\ntheir turn, are said to have either submitted quietly to its influence,\r\nor, after a short and unavailing struggle, to have yielded to this\r\nwell-organized party the conduct of affairs. The bench, the magistracy,\r\nthe high offices of the Episcopal Church, and a great part of the legal\r\nprofession, are filled by the adherents of this party: by grant or\r\npurchase they have acquired nearly the whole of the waste lands of the\r\nProvince; they are all-powerful in the chartered banks, and, till\r\nlately, shared among themselves almost exclusively all offices of trust\r\nand profit.\"\r\n\r\nThe influences which produced the Family Compact were not confined to\r\nUpper Canada. In the Lower Province, as well as in Nova Scotia and New\r\nBrunswick, similar causes led to similar results, and the term \"Family\r\nCompact\" has at one time or another been a familiar one in all the\r\nBritish North American colonies. But in none of them did the\r\norganization attain to such a plenitude of power as in this Province,\r\nand in none of them did it wield the sceptre of authority with so\r\nthorough an indifference to the principles of right and wrong. Its name\r\nis a rather indefinite, but not inapt characterization. Lord Durham\r\nrefers to the term \"Family Compact,\" as being not much more appropriate\r\nthan party designations usually are; \"inasmuch as,\" he writes, \"there\r\nis, in truth, very little of family connexion among the persons thus\r\nunited.[47]\" \"Much\" is a saving clause, but if his Lordship had thought\r\nit worth his while to enquire minutely into the relations subsisting\r\nbetween the members of this body, he would have found that there had\r\nbeen a good many intermarriages between them, and that the pecuniary\r\ninterests which bound them together had been welded by the most powerful\r\nof social bonds.[48] The designation \"Family Compact,\" however, did not\r\nowe its origin to any combination of North American colonists, but was\r\nborrowed from the diplomatic history of Europe. By the treaty signed at\r\nParis on the 15th of August, 1761, by representatives on behalf of\r\nFrance and Spain, the contracting parties agreed to guarantee each\r\nother's territories, to provide mutual succours by sea and land, and to\r\nconsider the enemy of either as the enemy of both. This treaty, being\r\ncontracted between the two branches of the House of Bourbon, is known to\r\nhistory as the Family Compact Treaty, and the name was adopted in the\r\nCanadas, as well as in the Maritime Provinces, to designate the\r\ncombination which enjoyed a monopoly of power and place in the\r\ncommunity, and among the members whereof there seemed to be a perfect,\r\nif unexpressed, understanding, that they were to make common cause\r\nagainst any and all persons who might attempt to diminish or destroy\r\ntheir influence.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Family Compact, with very few exceptions, were\r\nmembers of the Church of England, which, owing to the before-mentioned\r\nprovisions in the Constitutional Act, they regarded as the State Church\r\nof Upper Canada, established by law, and entitled to the special\r\nveneration of the inhabitants. They accounted all persons as members of\r\nthe Church of England who were not actual members of some other\r\nreligious body, and in enumerating the people for statistical purposes\r\nthey sometimes even went so far as to include the infant children of\r\nDissenters as Episcopalians. They sought to defend the alleged\r\nestablishment of a State Church in Canada by arguments which it is\r\nastonishing to think that men of education and intelligence should ever\r\nhave stooped to employ. \"There should be in every Christian country an\r\nestablished religion,\" said Dr. Strachan, in his evidence before the\r\nSelect Committee on Grievances, in 1835, \"otherwise it is not a\r\nChristian but an infidel country.\"[49] According to their theory, one of\r\nthe principal ends of the Government of Upper Canada was the propagation\r\nof religious truth as set forth in the doctrines of the Church of\r\nEngland. True, the arguments on the subject were not so well understood\r\nthen as now. Mr. Gladstone's little volume on \"The State in its\r\nRelations with the Church,\" and Macaulay's answer thereto in the\r\n_Edinburgh Review_, had not then been published. But some of the most\r\nconclusive arguments adduced by Macaulay were as old as the world\r\nitself; and even Mr. Gladstone, in all his youthful exuberance, did not\r\nventure to take so preposterous a stand as was assumed by the upholders\r\nof a State Church in this Province. Their bigotry and intolerance were\r\nutterly out of keeping with the times in which they lived, and were\r\nbetter suited to the days of Archbishop Laud or Sir Robert Filmer. Of\r\nthat heaven-born charity which suffereth long, and is kind; which\r\nvaunteth not itself, and is not puffed up; which seeketh not her own,\r\nand is not easily provoked; which thinketh no evil; which rejoiceth not\r\nin iniquity, but rejoiceth in the truth; which beareth all things,\r\nbelieveth all things, endureth all things--of the spirit which impels to\r\nsuch a state of mind as this, we find few traces in the lives and\r\nwritings of the upholders of State-Churchism in Upper Canada in those\r\ndays. We find, on the contrary, much unkindness, much vaunting of\r\nthemselves, much selfish conceit, much seeking, not only of their own,\r\nbut of that which of right belonged to their neighbours. The champions\r\nof ecclesiastical monopoly were easily provoked to anger, and to\r\nthinking and speaking all manner of evil of those who differed from them\r\nas to the distribution of the Clergy Reserves. Roman Catholicism they\r\ncontemplated with a certain amount of toleration, as the Roman Catholic\r\nhierarchy yielded the Government an unwavering support in return for the\r\nfreedom and privileges which they enjoyed. But their toleration was not\r\nbroad enough to cover any other form of religious belief. Dissent, in\r\nall its multiform phases, they looked upon with mingled abhorrence and\r\ncontempt--as a thing to be shunned and tabooed by all right-minded\r\npersons. Dissenting ministers of religion were regarded as \"low\r\nfellows,\" whom it was no sin to persecute, and, if possible, drive out\r\nof the country. Comparatively few of the latter were permitted to\r\nsolemnize matrimony during the first forty years of the Province's\r\nhistory. By the statute 38 George III., chapter 4, passed in 1798, the\r\nprivilege of doing so was accorded to ministers of \"The Church of\r\nScotland, or Lutherans or Calvinists;\" but it was hedged about with\r\ncumbrous restrictions which must have been felt as humiliating and\r\nunnecessary. No person was to be regarded as a minister under the Act\r\nuntil he had appeared before the Justices of the Peace in Quarter\r\nSessions, and had produced satisfactory credentials of his ordination.\r\nHe was also compelled to take the oath of allegiance. Even after\r\ncomplying with all formalities, his functions were restricted to cases\r\nwhere one or both of the parties to be joined together belonged to his\r\nown religious society. Ministers of other denominations, including those\r\nof the Methodist body, which was the most numerous religious community\r\nin the Province, were not allowed the privilege of solemnizing marriage\r\nrites till the year 1831. The ignominous disqualification was removed\r\nby the statute 11 George IV., chapter 36, which was passed in 1830, but\r\nwhich did not receive the royal assent until the following year. A\r\nsimilar measure had repeatedly been passed by the Assembly in former\r\nsessions, but had as often been rejected by the Upper House. Before the\r\nlaw was finally and equitably settled as above mentioned, several\r\nministers of religion had been tried and banished from the Province for\r\nhaving ventured to solemnize matrimony without legal authority. It is\r\nsaid that in one case where a minister was tried on a charge of this\r\nkind, the accused protested against his sentence, alleging that the\r\nChief Justice, who presided at the trial, had himself sanctioned the\r\nperformance of the ceremony. The Chief Justice, being called upon to\r\ndescend from the judgment seat and give evidence as to this fact,\r\ndeclined to do so; but he afterwards procured a pardon for the\r\nprisoner.[50]\r\n\r\nThe Compact always contained within its ranks a few persons of more than\r\naverage ability. Some of them doubtless believed that the course pursued\r\nby their organization was for the advantage of the colony, though,\r\nreasoning by the light of present knowledge, it is difficult to\r\ncomprehend how men of even moderate perspicacity and judgment could have\r\nbrought themselves to such a conclusion. It was, however, inevitable\r\nthat persons of such narrow and contracted views--persons to whom self\r\nand pelf were the mainsprings of life--should degenerate, mentally as\r\nwell as morally. The persons composing the second generation were, with\r\nvery few exceptions, striking illustrations of the doctrine of the\r\ndescent of man. Their sires had been men of energy and force of\r\ncharacter. They themselves were--to borrow a phrase from the acting\r\ndrama--the mere walking gentlemen of the colony. The sires had\r\noriginated a bold and determined policy, and had from first to last\r\npursued it with consistent vigour. The sons had neither brains to\r\nconceive nor discretion to carry out the conceptions of others. The\r\nsires had been persons whom it had been possible for the commonalty to\r\nrespect. The sons were persons whom it was impossible not to despise.\r\nSurely a more superlatively commonplace and contemptible race of human\r\nbeings has seldom been seen on the earth than four-fifths of the second\r\ngeneration of this bastard aristocracy of Upper Canada. It bore no\r\nresemblance to any other aristocracy whereof history has preserved any\r\nrecord. The old Roman commonalty, while they groaned beneath the iron\r\nheel of tyranny, were one and all conscious of a secret pride in their\r\nimperial oppressors. For the Roman aristocracy was an aristocracy of\r\nnature. The Roman patricians made foreign rulers to crouch and tremble\r\nat the name of Rome. Their triumphs were the triumphs of the nation.\r\nCaius of Corioli, Furius Camillus, Titus Capitolinus, were names the\r\nmere utterance of which stirred the Roman blood like the blast of a\r\ntrumpet. For many a long year after one haughty dictator had slept his\r\nlast sleep beneath the walls of Praeneste, and after another had taken\r\nhis final plunge beneath the yellow Tiber or from the Tarpeian rock,\r\ntheir exploits furnished themes for tale and song around the Roman\r\ncamp-fires. These puissant representatives of the dominant class had\r\nshown little sympathy for the plebeians, upon whom they had looked down\r\nfrom a lofty height, and towards whom they had ever borne themselves\r\nwith haughtiness and disdain. But their pride was a something to be\r\ntolerated by Romans of every degree, for they had achieved much glory\r\nfor the Roman name. In the words of one who has interpreted the\r\nsentiment of those times with rare felicity, Rome could bear the pride\r\nof him of whom herself was proud. The old French noblesse, again, were\r\nnot devoid of redeeming qualities. Their galling yoke would not have\r\nbeen borne from reign to reign, and through century after century, even\r\nby such seeming reconcilables as constituted the bulk of the French\r\npopulace during the ante-Revolutionary period, if they had all been like\r\nthe wicked St. Evremonde of Mr. Dickens's tragic story. As a class, they\r\nhad a subtle French grace about them which rendered their most grievous\r\nexactions less hard to bear than were the exactions of their eastern\r\nneighbours. They were an unmistakable _haute noblesse_, ever polished\r\nand dignified. Some of them, like Philippe Egalite, had the cunning,\r\nwhen the time of trial arrived, to bend to the popular storm, and even\r\nto affect a zeal for citizenship. Comparatively few of them were at once\r\n_blase_ and brainless. It may be doubted if a single one of them\r\ncombined--as did many of the rank and file of the second generation of\r\nthe Family Compact of Upper Canada--the pretensions of an aristocrat\r\nwith the sentiments of a boor and the intellectual development of a\r\nchild. Yet further. The feeling of veneration with which the English\r\ncommonalty have for centuries regarded the House of Lords is easy enough\r\nto understand. That feeling seems to be rapidly passing away, if,\r\nindeed, it has not already departed. But it would not have endured from\r\nthe time of the Plantagenets to the time of Queen Victoria if it had not\r\nhad some substantial foundation to rest upon. The House of Lords has\r\nalways contained a number of men of high integrity and ability. Take it\r\nfor all and all, it is probably the most just-minded and intellectual\r\naristocratic assembly the world has ever seen. This may not be very high\r\npraise, but it may at least be taken for what it is worth. Its\r\nindividual members are seldom brought sufficiently near to the lower\r\norder of the commonalty to enable the latter to detect their weaknesses.\r\nTheir wealth, prestige and social position give them a vast influence,\r\nwhile at the same time their legislative powers are held in check by the\r\ndirect representatives of the people. Most of these conditions were\r\ndirectly reversed in Upper Canada, where the members of the dominant\r\nfaction were brought into the closest relations with the people\r\ngenerally, insomuch that their many deficiencies could not be concealed.\r\nSuch wealth as they had they were too often known to have obtained at\r\nthe expense of the rest of the community. The Lower House formed no\r\nefficacious check upon them, for they either managed to return a\r\nsufficient number of their tools to control the vote in that body, or\r\nelse they rendered the Assembly's operations of no avail by means of\r\ntheir influence in the Legislative Council. They had none of the\r\ngraceful suavity of the Lower Canadian seigneurs. Nor could they boast\r\nof the superiority derived from a liberal education. Many of them--even\r\nincluding some of those who held high public offices--were so illiterate\r\nthat they were unable to write a simple business letter without\r\ncommitting errors of orthography of which any one but Artemus Ward or\r\nJeames de la Pluche might well feel ashamed.\r\n\r\nNearly all the leading spirits of this strangely-assorted oligarchy were\r\neither wealthy or on the direct road to wealth. Being comfortably\r\nprovided for at the public cost, in the form of fat offices or wild\r\nlands, or both, they assumed a swelling port, and aped, as best they\r\nknew how, the manners and customs of the upper classes in Great Britain.\r\nThey built their dwellings in imitation of old-fashioned English\r\nmanor-houses, with a variety of wings and gables, and with broad\r\nentrance halls which in an emergency might have served the purpose of\r\npresence-chambers. They dined long and late, and with much old-world\r\npomp and ceremonial. They drove out in coaches emblazoned with heraldic\r\nbearings, and attended by broad-calved flunkeys in family livery.\r\nCertain social observances of the early Georgian era, long since effete\r\nand worn out in England, flourished in the social life of Little York\r\ndown to a period within the memory of many persons who are still living.\r\nThe aristocratic clique which preserved these customs was in the highest\r\ndegree rigid and exclusive. No outsider was admitted into the charmed\r\ncircle unless he came duly ticketed and accredited. The attempt to\r\ntransplant the usages of an old and advanced state of society into the\r\nprimitive streets and lanes of such places as York, Kingston, and\r\nWoodstock was for a time more successful than might be supposed. Such of\r\nthe families as had been to the manner born carried off these\r\nobservances with considerable grace. They had brought their traditions\r\nwith them across the Atlantic, and though such traditions were not well\r\nsuited to the genius of a young and sparsely-settled colony, they were\r\nat least maintained with some regard to the sources whence they had been\r\nderived. With the pretenders who formed a portion of the clique, and who\r\nhad been admitted into it for special political reasons, the attempt to\r\ncopy the habits of their social superiors was, generally speaking, less\r\nsatisfactory. There was, in truth, an inner social circle which these\r\nlatter were never invited to join. They, however, enjoyed all the\r\npolitical and pecuniary advantages arising from their connection, and\r\nwere not easily distinguishable by outsiders from the very head and\r\nfront of the organization.\r\n\r\nSo far as to the wealthy members of the ruling faction. But there were a\r\ngood many of them who not only were not wealthy, but who were in\r\npositively indigent circumstances. These, for the most part, were\r\nmembers of old country families who had sent them to Canada with the\r\nsole object of getting rid of them. Others were half-pay officers who\r\nhad spent their whole fortunes in settling on land, after which they had\r\nfound themselves unable to make a livelihood, and had then sold their\r\nproperty for as much--or as little--as they could manage to get. These\r\nlatter, after having disposed of their lands, generally repaired to the\r\ntowns, and most of them sooner or later found their way to the\r\nProvincial capital. There they became obedient slaves of those in\r\nauthority, and picked up a precarious livelihood by making themselves\r\nuseful in various ways. The Executive could always find a certain amount\r\nof work for such persons, though, if the truth must be told, the supply\r\nwas often greater than the demand. The code of social ethics in vogue\r\namong this class was such as might have been expected from persons who\r\nhad been reared to regard themselves as the objects of a special\r\ndispensation of fortune. They looked upon manual labour as degrading.\r\nAny person, no matter what his abilities, who earned a livelihood by the\r\nsweat of his brow, or even by honest trade, was considered as no fit\r\ncompany for the brood of parasites who hung on to the heels of the\r\nCompact, and who nevertheless did not hesitate to perform tasks from\r\nwhich the average costermonger would have shrunk in disgust. Their\r\nemployers occasionally admitted them to their tables, and even to some\r\ndegree of social intimacy. More frequently they presented them with\r\ntheir cast-off clothing, with new gowns for their wives at Christmas,\r\nor--when things were at a remarkably low ebb--with a hundredweight of\r\nflour or half a barrel of mess pork. Yet the recipients of these favours\r\npiqued themselves upon their good birth and high connexions, and would\r\nhave felt themselves insulted if anyone had ventured to hint that they\r\nshould visit, upon terms of equality, with the grocer or the butcher in\r\nthe next street.\r\n\r\nThe reader now has before him a sufficient array of facts to enable him\r\nto form a pretty accurate conception of the state of social life in\r\nUpper Canada during ante-Rebellion times. It was a matter of course that\r\nsuch a monopoly of power as was possessed and exercised by the ruling\r\nfaction should excite envy and opposition on the part of those who did\r\nnot revel in its smiles or share in its plunder. Loud murmurings began\r\nto make themselves heard against the delay and partiality in the\r\nland-granting department, and against the corrupt manner in which the\r\npublic affairs of the Province generally were carried on. Before the\r\nclose of Governor Hunter's _regime_ these murmurings had become loud\r\nenough to occasion no little disquiet to some of the officials who had\r\nmost reason to dread enquiry and investigation. The abuses were greater\r\nin some branches of the service than in others, but peculation prevailed\r\nto a greater or less extent almost everywhere. The Indian department was\r\nnotorious for the corruption of its officials. A sum of sixty thousand\r\npounds sterling was annually granted by the Imperial Government for\r\ndistribution among the various tribes, and for the payment of agents and\r\ninterpreters. The distribution among the Indians chiefly took the form\r\nof commodities which had a particular fascination for the mind of the\r\nnoble savage--such commodities, for instance, as muskets, powder,\r\nbullets, knives, tomahawks, hatchets, blankets, spangles, pocket\r\nmirrors, and--last, but by no means least--fire-water. The opportunities\r\nwhich this grant afforded for peculation and plunder were too tempting\r\nto be resisted. The agents and their subordinates, from highest to\r\nlowest, owed their positions to their servility and usefulness to those\r\nin authority. So long as they proved serviceable and obedient to their\r\nmasters, there was not much likelihood of their being called to serious\r\naccount for any iniquities they might commit towards Mohawk or Seneca,\r\nOneida or Mississauga. By way of consequence, the Indians were robbed and\r\nthe Government was robbed; and the robbers, feeling secure of protection\r\nfrom their superiors, plied their nefarious traffic with impunity.[51]\r\nThere were equally culpable but less notorious abuses of power in other\r\nbranches of the service. Probably not one in ten of these ever came to\r\nlight, but from time to time there were awkward revelations which could\r\nnot be suppressed. All these things combined to beget a widespread lack\r\nof confidence in the official clique. The want of confidence, not\r\nwithout good reason, extended even to the administrators of the law. The\r\njudges, as already mentioned, held office at the will of the Executive,\r\nand, at least in some instances, were shamelessly servile and corrupt.\r\nThis led to their dicta being disregarded by sturdy juries who cared\r\nless for the letter of the law than for its spirit. Mr. John Mills\r\nJackson, in his \"View of the Political Situation of the Province of\r\nUpper Canada,\" published in 1809, speaks of an instance where the people\r\nbecame tumultuous, and broke the public stocks in the presence of the\r\nChief Justice.[52] The public distrust of the administrators of the law\r\ndoes not seem to have been confined to the judges of the Superior\r\nCourts. It extended to the rural magistrates, some of whom turned their\r\noffices to commodity in a manner which would have excited the admiration\r\nof Falstaff himself. \"The shop-keepers,\" writes Mr. Jackson, \"are\r\nJustices of Peace. They have the means of extortion, and the power of\r\nenforcing payments. They are first the criminals, then the judges; and\r\nthe court of appeal seems to be so constructed as to prevent an honest\r\nverdict from passing into effect. The practice of the court is unjust,\r\noppressive, and influenced. Favourite attorneys were made deputy clerks\r\nof the peace, so that process might be entered and writs obtained most\r\npartially. The crown lawyer is allowed nearly seven pounds sterling for\r\nevery criminal prosecution! an inducement to listen to trifling\r\ncomplaints, and prefer frivolous indictments, when, if power was\r\ngratified and independence harassed, it was a sufficient excuse for an\r\ninflated contingent account.\" The author of this scathing philippic\r\nagainst petty oppression proceeds to recount a case wherein an action\r\nwas brought against a magistrate who had exerted his authority in an\r\nillegal and oppressive manner. A verdict was obtained against him for a\r\nhundred pounds. An application was made to the Court of King's Bench to\r\nset the verdict aside, which was rejected; whereupon the clerk of the\r\ncourt in which the judgment had been obtained was ordered by the Crown\r\nlawyer not to issue execution. The clerk knew better than to disobey an\r\norder from such a source, and the plaintiff accordingly took nothing by\r\nhis verdict. The unrighteous magistrate escaped the penalty of his\r\nmisdeeds, and furnished a sort of standing precedent for magisterial\r\niniquity. Other equally flagrant perversions of justice are recorded by\r\nthe same authority. An illegal and unjustifiable extent issued, at the\r\nsuit of the Crown, against one of the civil officers. It lasted for\r\nyears; yet the officer dared not resist oppression by applying for\r\njustice. \"When [the extent] was as imperiously taken off as it was\r\narbitrarily laid on,\" writes Mr. Jackson, \"the sheriff dared not apply\r\nfor fees expended in holding possession under the writ, or the printer\r\nsue for the money voted him by the House of Assembly for printing their\r\njournals. The surveyors could not obtain the money they had actually\r\nexpended in the public service, nor the people find redress for extorted\r\nfees. Therefore, when there was neither substance nor shadow of law or\r\njustice, but the will of power was the rule of decision, the public mind\r\nwas agitated in the extreme, and universal gloom pervaded the Province.\"\r\n\r\nThe discontent produced by official tyranny was however almost impotent\r\nas against the wrong-doers, who were so strongly entrenched in their\r\nplaces that it seemed as though nothing could shake them. Many of them,\r\nconscious of their misconduct, doubtless felt secret misgivings whenever\r\nany specially significant outburst of popular dissatisfaction occurred.\r\nBut for many years they were able to present a united and brazen front,\r\nand to crush anyone who dared to so much as wag a finger against them.\r\nIt was intimated on a former page that Robert Gourlay was not the first\r\nvictim of Executive tyranny. The first conspicuous victim of whom any\r\nrecord has been preserved was Mr. Robert Thorpe, an English barrister of\r\nmuch learning and acumen, who in 1805 was appointed a puisne judge of\r\nthe Court of King's Bench for Upper Canada. Previous to his arrival in\r\nthis country Mr. Thorpe had never been remarkable for any specially\r\nliberal opinions, but he was a man of enlightened mind, and actuated by\r\nan honest desire to do his duty. He was not long in perceiving that the\r\nadministration of justice in this Province was little better than a\r\nhollow mockery. He resolved to do what one man could to restore public\r\nconfidence in the judicial bench, and his court erelong became a popular\r\nforum for honest litigants, for it was evident to all that he held the\r\nscales of justice with an even hand, and was not to be either cajoled or\r\nbullied into perverting the law. Before he had been a twelvemonth in the\r\ncountry he was known far and wide as an upright judge, and as a sort of\r\nchampion of popular rights. Grand juries took him into their confidence,\r\nand tabulated their grievances before him. These were laid by him\r\nbefore the authorities at York, upon his return from circuit; a\r\nproceeding which was quite sufficient to bring down upon his head\r\nthe opposition of the faction which flourished by reason of those very\r\ngrievances. The whole of the Family Compact influence arrayed itself\r\nagainst him in deadly enmity. Francis Gore arrived in the capacity of\r\nLieutenant-Governor in the summer of 1806. He was informed by his\r\nCouncillors that Judge Thorpe was a dangerous and revolutionary\r\npersonage. It was certain that the past year had been signalized by a\r\ndecided propensity on the part of the people to assert themselves\r\nagainst the intolerable exactions of their oppressors, and that a spirit\r\nof opposition was on the increase throughout the land. Governor Gore and\r\nhis Councillors reversed the inductive process, and attributed the\r\npopular discontent to the influence of the new judge. This seeming\r\nconviction on their parts was strengthened by certain remarks of Judge\r\nThorpe himself, made in reply to an address from the Grand Jury of the\r\nLondon District. \"The art of governing,\" said he, \"is a difficult\r\nscience. Knowledge is not instinctive, and the days of inspiration have\r\npassed away. Therefore, when there was neither talent, education,\r\ninformation, nor even manners in the Administration, little could be\r\nexpected, and nothing was produced.\" The reference here is manifestly to\r\nthe _regime_ of Governor Hunter and Commodore Grant; and the intimation\r\nis that better things are to be hoped for under the recently-arrived\r\nGovernor. \"But,\" continued the judge, \"there is an ultimate point of\r\ndepression, as well as of exaltation, from whence all human affairs\r\nnaturally advance or recede. Therefore, proportionate to your\r\ndepression, we may expect your progress in prosperity will advance with\r\naccelerated velocity.\" He also in the course of his address, inveighed\r\nagainst the Alien Act of 1804. When he reached York, at the close of the\r\ncircuit, he laid before the new Lieutenant-Governor the various\r\nrecapitulations of grievances which had been entrusted to him. They were\r\nreceived by Mr. Gore and his Councillors with a very ill grace. The\r\ncomplaints from the London District were stated with great vigour and\r\nlucidity, and as they had got into print they could not be suppressed or\r\nwholly ignored. An attempt was made to show that the chapter of\r\ngrievances had been presented by the jurors, not because there was\r\nreally anything of importance to complain of, but because Judge Thorpe\r\nhimself had instigated them to such a course. As this charge was openly\r\nmade, Mr. Thorpe in his capacity of a Justice of the King's Bench,\r\ncaused a proceeding of the nature of _scandalum magnatum_ to be\r\ninstituted. His brother judges, however, some of whom were members of\r\nthe Executive Council, and all of whom were subject to strong influences\r\nfrom that quarter, ruled that the proceeding could not be maintained,\r\nand it accordingly fell through. An attempt was also made, first to\r\nintimidate, and afterwards to corrupt the Grand Jury. A letter was sent\r\nto them from the office of the Lieutenant-Governor, requesting them to\r\nstate the grounds of their complaints more specifically. The recipients\r\nresponded by preparing and forwarding a stronger case than before. A\r\nrecantation was then drawn up by a skilful hand, and presented to each\r\nindividual member of the Jury, a reward being at the same time offered\r\nas an inducement to sign it. The jurymen, however, were not prepared to\r\nbarter away their liberties in this manner, and the attempt wholly\r\nfailed. While the Executive were deliberating as to how they could most\r\neffectually strike Judge Thorpe, a vacancy occurred in the\r\nrepresentation of one of the constituencies in the Home District. In\r\nthose times, as has already been seen, a judgeship was no\r\ndisqualification for political life, and a deputation waited on Mr.\r\nThorpe with a numerously signed address, requesting him to become their\r\nrepresentative. He replied that he would not become a partisan, but that\r\nif he were returned to Parliament he would not hesitate to do his duty.\r\nNo sooner did it become known that \"the Radical Judge,\" as he was\r\ncalled, was a candidate for the Assembly than the leading spirits of the\r\nCompact aroused themselves to defeat him. This was natural enough. That\r\nthey should employ against him every means which their ingenuity could\r\ndevise--among others, bribery, vilification and deliberate slander--that\r\nalso was natural, when the time and persons are considered. \"Every\r\nengine within the reach of authority,\" writes Mr. Jackson, \"was used for\r\nthe purpose of defeating the wishes of the people on this occasion. All\r\ninterests were required to yield in favour of the candidate most likely\r\nto succeed as against Mr. Thorpe. Any person in employment, in\r\nexpectation of, or entitled to land, was gratified, promised, or\r\nthreatened; magistrates were made and unmade, as best suited the\r\npurposes of electioneering; grants were given; fees excused, or promised\r\nto be paid by those high in authority. Even domestics were bribed with\r\nplaces, land, and money, to vilify and accuse, by direct falsehoods, the\r\nmost upright, serviceable and esteemed persons in the Province.\" For\r\nonce public opinion proved too strong for Family Compact influence.\r\nJudge Thorpe was returned, and great things were hoped for from his\r\ncareer in Parliament. But the triumph of freedom was short-lived. The\r\nCompact was too strong to be opposed by the multitude with impunity.\r\nLieutenant-Governor Gore was subservient to its wishes, and besides he\r\nhad by this time come to hate the popular judge on his own account, and\r\nhis mind was fully made up to solicit from the Colonial Secretary Judge\r\nThorpe's recall. One of his private letters, written from Kingston,\r\nduring a journey from York to Montreal, several months after the Judge's\r\nelection to the Assembly, announces this resolution in unmistakable\r\nterms. \"The object of Mr. T.'s [Thorpe's] emissions,\" he writes,\r\n\"appears to be to persuade the people to turn every gentleman out of the\r\nHouse of Assembly. However, keep your temper with the rascals, I beseech\r\nyou. I shall represent everything at St. James'.\" He was as good as his\r\nword, and in October, 1807, the announcement was made in the _Gazette_\r\nthat the Lieutenant-Governor had been instructed to suspend Mr. Thorpe\r\nfrom his judgeship, which we may be quite sure was done without\r\nunnecessary loss of time.\r\n\r\nThus did might continue to triumph over right. There was not the\r\nslightest imputation of any sort against the Judge's character. His\r\nprofessional attainments were high; his personal character without a\r\nstain. His continued presence in Canada would have been a blessing to\r\nall but the race of tyrants who trampled on popular liberty. Yet he was\r\nremoved because he respected himself and his office too highly to\r\npervert judgment, and because he bade fair to abridge the rule of\r\ncorruption. Upon his return to England the Colonial Office urged nothing\r\nwhatever against him, and merely suggested, by way of justification for\r\nhis recall, that his stay in Upper Canada would have led to perpetual\r\ndisturbance of the public tranquillity. He instituted proceedings in one\r\nof the English courts against Mr. Gore, who was convicted of libel, but\r\nwho escaped much more easily than he deserved with a fine of trifling\r\namount. By way of recompense for his recall from Upper Canada, Judge\r\nThorpe was appointed Chief Justice of Sierra Leone. There he remained\r\nfor two years, by which time his constitution had become so much broken\r\nby the climate that he was compelled to return home. At the request of a\r\nnumber of the inhabitants he carried with him to England a petition\r\ncomplaining of certain abuses of power there. For this he was discarded\r\nby the Ministry of the day. His appointment as Chief Justice was\r\ncancelled, and another judge was sent out to West Africa in his stead.\r\nThe rest of his life was passed in obscurity and neglect, and when he\r\ndied his family were left without any provision for their future. Such\r\nwas the untoward fate of an honourable and high-minded man, whose only\r\nfault was that he was too pure for the times in which he lived, and for\r\nthe people among whom his lot was cast.\r\n\r\nAnother early victim, whose life record seems to contradict the adage\r\nthat honesty is the best policy, was Surveyor-General Wyatt. There is no\r\nneed to go minutely into the particulars of his case. He was universally\r\nrecognized as a competent and honest official, insomuch that it was\r\ncurrently said of him that he was too good for the masters whom he\r\nserved. But he ventured to interfere on behalf of one of the\r\nsubordinates in his office, who had been refused a stipend to which Mr.\r\nWyatt considered him entitled. Then, he presumed to oppose the Council\r\nin respect of an irregular purchase of a large tract of land from the\r\nMississauga Indians. Finally, he went so far as to profess a high degree\r\nof respect for the manly and independent conduct of Judge Thorpe. The\r\nsecret conclave speedily pronounced his doom. No one ventured to allege\r\nany fault against him, yet he was deprived of his situation by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and a pliable tool was installed in his office.\r\n\r\nJoseph Willcocks had a more bitter experience still. He was an Irishman,\r\nof liberal education, and of much energy of character, whose influence\r\nin official circles was wide enough to obtain for him the post of\r\nSheriff of the Home District. For several years no occasion for any\r\ndifference of opinion arose between him and his superiors. He was known\r\nas a competent officer, who discharged his duties with great\r\nconsideration for the impecunious and unfortunate. But his frequent\r\nofficial peregrinations through the Home District enabled him to see\r\nwith his own eyes the disastrous effects of the Clergy Reserves, of the\r\nland-granting system, and of Family Compact domination generally; and on\r\nseveral occasions he had sufficient courage to express his opinions\r\nthereupon. Attempts were made to silence him, first by remonstrances,\r\nand afterwards by threats, but all to no purpose. When Judge Thorpe\r\nbegan to figure as a sort of popular tribune, Willcocks declared himself\r\nas being also on the side of the people. When the Judge became a\r\ncandidate for Parliament, the Sheriff, who had a vote in the\r\nconstituency, recorded it in his favour. For this he shared the fate of\r\nthe Surveyor-General, and was promptly dismissed from office by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor. But he came of a fighting stock, and was not to be\r\nsuppressed by the mere circumstance of being deprived of an official\r\nincome. He started a newspaper called _The Upper Canada Guardian, or\r\nFreeman's Journal_. In this sheet, which was edited by Mr. Willcocks\r\nhimself, various desirable measures of reform were advocated, and the\r\ndominant faction were from time to time referred to in opprobrious, but\r\ncertainly not untruthful or unmerited language. The paper obtained a\r\nconsiderable circulation, and soon made its editor an object of bitter\r\nhatred on the part of the authorities. The vilest abuse was poured out\r\nupon him, and he was subjected to a course of persecution well-nigh as\r\ngrievous as subsequently fell to the lot of Robert Gourlay. Governor\r\nGore himself, in a letter still extant, written in 1807, refers to him\r\nas \"that execrable monster who would deluge the Province with blood.\"\r\nThe execrable monster's influence, however, continued to grow, and upon\r\nJudge Thorpe's retirement from Upper Canada, he was returned to the\r\nAssembly in his stead, for the West Riding of the County of York, the\r\nFirst Riding of the County of Lincoln, and the County of Haldimand. As\r\nhe was a ready and powerful speaker, as well as a vigorous writer, it\r\nwas felt that he would soon become intolerable if his career were not\r\neffectively checked. He was accordingly tried before the Assembly on a\r\nfrivolous charge of having, in a private conversation held at the house\r\nof a Mr. Glennan, in York, spoken disrespectfully of some of the\r\nmembers. The proceedings were the veriest travesty of the forms of\r\njustice. The accused was found guilty, and committed to the common jail\r\nof the Home District, there to remain during the sitting of\r\nParliament.[53] This indignity he was compelled to suffer, being\r\nconfined for many weeks in a small close cell, which he was not\r\npermitted to leave for a single moment. He was further wrought upon by\r\ninformations for libel, as well as by secret inquisitions into his\r\nprivate affairs. After his enlargement he continued to publish his\r\npaper, but he was so tortured by the incessant persecutions to which he\r\nwas subjected that he could accomplish little or nothing in the way of\r\nreform. From some of his votes in the Assembly it would appear that he\r\nmade tacit overtures towards reconciliation with his enemies,[54] but he\r\nhad offended too deeply to be forgiven, and their rancour was not to be\r\nappeased. Eventually he was compelled to relinquish the publication of\r\nthe _Guardian_ for want of funds to carry it on. Notwithstanding all\r\nthat he had endured, his loyalty remained unshaken, and when the War of\r\n1812[55] broke out he responded to the call for volunteers by\r\nshouldering his musket and doing his devoirs like a man at the battle of\r\nQueenston Heights. Even this obtained for him neither complaisance nor\r\nimmunity from abuse. He found himself ruined in fortune, opposed and\r\nhated by those in authority, without any prospect before him but\r\nstarvation. It is not singular that a man subjected to such conditions\r\nshould become disheartened. In a moment of exasperation he deserted the\r\nranks where he had been held as of so little account. Accompanied by a\r\nsmall body of Canadian volunteers, he repaired to the camp of the enemy,\r\nwhere he offered his services, and obtained a colonel's commission. He\r\nserved under Major-General Brown at the siege of Fort Erie, where he was\r\nslain while planting a guard.\r\n\r\nSuch are three of the most notable examples of ministerial tyranny in\r\ncomparatively early times. As before mentioned, they attracted less\r\nwidespread attention than did Mr. Gourlay's case some years later,\r\nbecause, though they were signal instances of the abuse of power, they\r\nwere not marked by such refinement in cruelty, and because they appealed\r\nto the political sympathies of comparatively few. In the time of Judge\r\nThorpe, Wyatt and Willcocks, the dominating class not only held a\r\nmonopoly of power, but they and their adherents were numerically in the\r\nascendant. At the time of Gourlay's persecution the population was much\r\nmore evenly divided. The oligarchy still had control of all the avenues\r\nto power, but there was a large and steadily-increasing class in the\r\ncommunity who recognized the fact that many changes were necessary\r\nbefore Upper Canada could become a prosperous and well-governed colony,\r\nand a satisfactory place of abode for the average British immigrant.\r\n\r\nIn closing this hasty review of the nature and effects of Family Compact\r\ndomination in Upper Canada, I would not be understood as pronouncing a\r\nsweeping condemnation upon all the individual members of that body. John\r\nBeverley Robinson, for instance, though he lent himself to many\r\nhigh-handed acts of oppression, was a man of undoubted ability, and of a\r\ncharacter which inspired respect. His descendants are to-day among the\r\nmost respected and influential members of society in our Provincial\r\ncapital. Several others were men of high personal character, and of\r\nabilities above the average. They acted in accordance with time and\r\ncircumstance, and must be supposed to have done so conscientiously. But\r\nsuch persons as these composed but a very slender proportion of the\r\nCompact's entire membership. The rank and file were of a totally\r\ndifferent complexion. The characteristics of the more poverty-stricken\r\namong them have already been hinted at; but, independently of these,\r\nthere were many who were well-to-do, and who held their heads high in\r\nthe air, who were nevertheless very ill qualified to win admiration for\r\nthe caste to which they belonged. To state the simple truth, most of\r\nthem were very ordinary commonplace personages, respectable, sapless,\r\nidealess--what Dr. Johnson would have characterized as exceedingly\r\nbarren rascals. Some were of obscure origin, and would have been hard\r\nput to it if required to trace their ancestry beyond a single\r\ngeneration. Of these latter, a few, as has already been seen, had\r\namassed wealth by trade or speculation, and had made their way into the\r\nexclusive circle by a fortunate combination of circumstances.\r\n\r\nAmong the Compact, then, the number of persons of good birth and\r\ndescent, possessed of sufficient qualifications to justify their\r\naristocratic predilections, and of sufficient capacity to enable them to\r\ndirect the colonial policy, was small. And it must by no means be\r\nsupposed that all the good blood in the Province was confined to the\r\nCompact. There were many persons among the pioneers of Upper Canada of\r\ngentle nurture and breeding, who nevertheless scorned to pose in the\r\ncharacter of aristocrats in a land where such assumptions were\r\naltogether out of place, and who manfully accommodated themselves to\r\ntheir primitive surroundings. As has been well remarked by Mr.\r\nMacMullen,[56] \"While they learned to wield the axe and swing the cradle\r\nwith the energy and skill of the roughest backwoodsman, they retained\r\ntheir polished manners, their literary tastes, their love for the\r\nbeautiful and the elegant; and thus exercised the most beneficial\r\ninfluence upon their rustic neighbours. In the absence of schools, of\r\nchurches, of most of the refining influences of civilized society, this\r\nclass of the early settlers of Upper Canada were foremost in usefulness.\r\nTheir superior education, their well-bred manners, their more refined\r\nhabits, raised them in the estimation of the rural population, who soon\r\ntacitly admitted a superiority which would never have been conceded [had\r\nit been] more directly asserted.\" Most, though not all, of these\r\ngentlemen were Tories, and, with hardly an exception, preserved their\r\nloyalty through all chances and changes. During the War of 1812-15, and\r\nagain during the agitation arising out of the Rebellion, they proved\r\ntrue to their Tory instincts, and rallied to the side of the Government\r\nwith ready fervour. Their social proclivities were equally removed from\r\nthe rude boorishness of the ordinary settler as from the pretence and\r\nceremonial of the clique of self-constituted aristocrats. They generally\r\npreserved a modicum of state in the regulation of their household\r\naffairs, though they kept aloof from the Compact and its practices, and\r\ndevoted themselves to various branches of industry--among others, to the\r\neducation of youth; to the practice of the learned professions; to the\r\nopening and cultivating of new avenues of commerce; and to reducing the\r\npathless forests to arable and smiling fields.\r\n\r\nOne other fact it is essential to bear in mind, in estimating the\r\neffects of the Compact's _regime_. In seizing upon all the official and\r\nother spoils within their reach, and in trampling upon the liberties of\r\nthe people, the magnates of Upper Canada were merely treading in the\r\nfootsteps of the Tite Barnacles of Great Britain. The period was one of\r\ntransition, all over the civilized world. Popular rights were but\r\nimperfectly understood, and the idea that good government is best served\r\nby the extension of justice and equal rights to all classes was only\r\nbeginning to dawn upon the minds of public men, even in old and\r\nlong-established communities. That Canada was not in advance of the\r\ntimes is not to be wondered at; but the ordeal through which she was\r\ncompelled to pass on the way to full and assured liberty forms an epoch\r\nhighly necessary to be understood and frequently remembered by all who\r\nappreciate the blessings which are the birthright of every Canadian of\r\nthe present day. A knowledge of the principles and practices of the\r\nFamily Compact in the olden days constitutes the most effectual\r\nguarantee that such days can never return, and that neither our children\r\nnor our children's children will ever be compelled to fight over again\r\nthe battle which was so long and so patiently waged by their ancestors.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] It may perhaps be thought by some readers that the closing\r\nsentences of this paragraph are pitched in too high a key. Those who\r\nentertain that opinion will receive light on the subject by a careful\r\nperusal of various official reports issued just prior to the passing of\r\nthe Quebec Act in 1774, and more especially of _A Cry from Quebec_,\r\npublished at Montreal in 1809.\r\n\r\n[46] _Report on the Affairs of British North America_, English folio\r\nedition, p. 53.\r\n\r\n[47] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[48] How far Lord Durham was justified in saying that there was \"little\r\nof family connexion\" among the members of the Compact will appear from\r\nthe following \"curious but accurate statement,\" prepared by Mr. W.

This\r\nfamily connexion rules Upper Canada according to its own good pleasure,\r\nand has no efficient check from this country to guard the people against\r\nits acts of tyranny and oppression. It includes the whole of the judges\r\nof the supreme civil and criminal tribunal (Nos. 6, 12, and 16)--active\r\nTory politicians. Judge Macaulay was a clerk in the office of No. 2, not\r\nlong since. It includes half the Executive Council or provincial\r\ncabinet. It includes the Speaker and other eight Members of the\r\nLegislative Council. It includes the persons who have the control of the\r\nCanada Land Company's monopoly. It includes the President and Solicitor\r\nof the Bank, and about half the Bank Directors; together with\r\nshareholders, holding, to the best of my recollection, about 1800\r\nshares. And it included the crown lawyers until last March, when they\r\ncarried their opposition to Viscount Goderich's measures of reform to\r\nsuch a height as personally to insult the government, and to declare\r\ntheir belief that he had not the royal authority for his despatches.\r\nThey were then removed; but, with this exception, the chain remains\r\nunbroken. This family compact surround the Lieutenant-Governor, and\r\nmould him, like wax, to their will; they fill every office with their\r\nrelatives, dependants, and partisans; by them justices of the peace and\r\nofficers of the militia are made and unmade; they have increased the\r\nnumber of the Legislative Council by recommending, through the Governor,\r\nhalf a dozen of nobodies and a few placemen, pensioners, and individuals\r\nof well-known narrow and bigoted principle; the whole of the revenues of\r\nUpper Canada are in reality at their mercy;--they are Paymasters,\r\nReceivers, Auditors, King, Lords, and Commons!\"\r\n\r\n[49] See his evidence annexed to the Committee's Report, p. 86.\r\n\r\n[50] Gourlay, commenting upon this episode, remarks: \"Who pardoned all\r\nthe poor sinners that for years had been getting bastards, and who\r\nlegitimized these, was not determined when I bade farewell to Upper\r\nCanada.\"--_Statistical Account_, Vol. 2, p. 348.\r\n\r\n[51] Those who wish to gain an insight into some of the most revolting\r\nfeatures of this traffic may consult _Claws and the Clauses_, a pamphlet\r\npublished at Buffalo in 1818; also _Gourlay_, vol. 2, pp. 486, 487;\r\ntogether with Jackson's pamphlet referred to in the text.\r\n\r\n[52] This must have been Chief Justice Thomas Scott, after whom Scott\r\nStreet, Toronto, was called. He was Chief Justice from August, 1806, to\r\nMichaelmas Term, 1816. He is referred to by Dr. Scadding in _Toronto of\r\nOld_, p. 51, as \"a man of fine culture, spoken of affectionately by\r\nthose who knew him.\" A picture of him in his decline is presented on\r\npage 130 of the same work.\r\n\r\n[53] For a full account of these infamous proceedings, the reader is\r\nreferred to _The Upper Canada Guardian_ of February 6th and March 18th,\r\n1808, quoted by Gourlay in his _Statistical Account_, Vol. 2, pp.\r\n655-662.\r\n\r\n[54] See an extract from the minutes of the proceedings in the Assembly,\r\n10th March, 1810, quoted by Gourlay, Vol. 2, pp. 328, 329. See also\r\nGourlay's remarks thereon, Vol. 2, pp. 334, 335.\r\n\r\n[55] There is reason to believe that the discontent begotten of the\r\nabuse of power in Canada was one of the inducements to this attempt on\r\nthe part of the United States, the Government of which was led to\r\nbelieve that Canadians generally would welcome any relief from the yoke\r\nwhich the Compact had placed upon their necks.\r\n\r\n[56] _History of Canada_, p. 243.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nFATHERS OF REFORM.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of Upper Canada, from the time of Mr. Gourlay's banishment,\r\nin 1819, down to the actual outbreak of rebellion, is largely made up of\r\na succession of abuses on the part of the Executive, and of more or less\r\npassive endurance on the part of the great body of the people. As has\r\nbeen intimated, the Gourlay prosecutions and their attendant\r\ncircumstances aroused much popular indignation, and led to the formation\r\nof an organized Opposition. During the session of 1820 the \"Gagging\r\nBill,\" as it was called, which had been introduced and carried through\r\nthe Assembly under the auspices of Mr. Jonas Jones[57] two years before,\r\nwas repealed,[58] and the holding of conventions was no longer\r\nprohibited by law. It is a fact worth mentioning that Attorney-General\r\nRobinson was the only member who recorded his vote against the repealing\r\nstatute, whereas at the time of the enactment of the original repressive\r\nlaw in 1818 only one vote had been given against it. Such a change of\r\nopinion among the members of the Assembly within so brief a space of\r\ntime is in itself significant of the progress of liberal views among the\r\npeople generally.\r\n\r\nThe vote on this repealing statute was somewhat of a surprise to the\r\nauthorities. It was evident that Reform sentiment was growing, and that\r\nmany persons who had never been classed as Reformers were weary of the\r\nlong reign of tyranny. It was not the policy of the Compact, however, to\r\nyield anything to popular demands, and they held on their course with\r\ndogged pertinacity, as though animated by a fixed resolve that the\r\npublic indignation which had been aroused by the Gourlay prosecutions\r\nshould not be permitted to subside. Erelong a new opportunity for\r\napplying the thumb-screw presented itself, and it was taken advantage of\r\nto the fullest practicable extent. During the recess following the close\r\nof the first session of the Eighth Provincial Parliament, which was\r\nprorogued on the 14th of April, 1821, a vacancy occurred in the\r\nrepresentation of the constituency of the United Counties of Lennox and\r\nAddington. The local Reformers took advantage of the opportunity thus\r\nafforded of bringing out a candidate who had rendered much service to\r\nLiberal principles in Upper Canada, and who was eminently fitted to\r\nimpart strength to the Opposition in the Assembly. His name was Barnabas\r\nBidwell, and he was known far and wide as one of the keenest intellects\r\nand as one of the best public speakers in the country. His past history\r\nhad been unfortunate, and as it was soon to be made the subject of\r\nstrict Parliamentary enquiry, a few leading facts in connection with it\r\nmay as well be set down here.\r\n\r\nHe was a native of Massachusetts, where he was born in the old colonial\r\ndays before the Revolution. He came of a Whig family which espoused the\r\ncolonial cause with ardour, but he was himself too young to take any\r\npart in the great struggle which gave birth to the United States. Having\r\ncompleted his education at Yale College, he studied law, and at an early\r\nage rose to eminence at the Massachusetts bar. He became\r\nAttorney-General of the State, and, though he had for his rivals some of\r\nthe ablest men known to American history, he was regarded by his\r\ncountrymen as one whose future was in his own hands. His manners were\r\ncourtly and refined, and his scholastic attainments wide and various. He\r\nsoon found his way to Congress, where his brilliant eloquence caused him\r\nto be listened to with attention and respect.\r\n\r\nUp to this time his career had been an uninterrupted success. But in\r\nachieving his political eminence he had been unfortunate enough to make\r\nfor himself a good many bitter enemies. His political course seems to\r\nhave been somewhat arbitrary and uncompromising, insomuch that his\r\nopponents regarded him with more rancorous feelings than are commonly\r\nentertained among public men where there are no personal grounds for\r\nenmity. Whether such personal grounds existed in the case of Barnabas\r\nBidwell cannot now be readily ascertained. It is however certain that he\r\nwas regarded by a host of clever and unscrupulous persons with a\r\nbitterness of enmity almost amounting to ferocity. He seems to have made\r\nno attempt to conciliate his foes, but treated them with a sort of\r\nhaughty contempt. In the year 1810 the weight of their anger descended\r\nupon him like an avalanche. He was then, and he for some years\r\npreviously had been, Treasurer of the County of Berkshire,\r\nMassachusetts. An accusation of a very serious nature was brought\r\nagainst him. He was charged with having applied the public funds to his\r\nown use, and with having falsified entries in his books in order to\r\ncover up his malversations. It is difficult to get at the exact truth in\r\nthe matter. Mr. Bidwell's attention to public affairs had caused him to\r\nneglect his private and professional business, which consequently had\r\nnot flourished. He was far from wealthy, and it is not improbable that\r\nhe was sometimes financially embarrassed. Whether he succumbed to\r\ntemptation, and dipped his hands into the treasury without leave, cannot\r\nnow be certainly declared. His own version of the matter was that he was\r\nentirely free from blame, but that his enemies had deliberately woven a\r\nsubtle web about him from which he was unable to extricate himself, as\r\nit would have been impossible for him, under the existing state of\r\nthings, to obtain justice. At all events, he seems to have felt himself\r\nto be unable to face the situation. Learning that an indictment had been\r\nlaid, and that a warrant had been issued for his apprehension, he fled\r\nfrom his native country, and took refuge in Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by his family, consisting of a son and daughter, he settled\r\nat the village of Bath, in the County of Addington, on the Bay of\r\nQuinte. He soon obtained employment as a school teacher, and encountered\r\nno difficulty in gaining a livelihood, though the humble role he was\r\ncompelled to play comported ill with his past experience and present\r\nambition. There is little doubt that he was an admirer of republican\r\ninstitutions, and that he so remained to the end of his life, though his\r\nadmiration was thrown away in this country, and it was impossible for\r\nhim to return to his own. He was a useful man in the little community\r\nwhere he resided, and his education and intelligence caused him to be\r\nlooked up to by people of all classes. He did not intrude his political\r\nviews further than to proclaim himself an advocate of Liberal ideas, and\r\nupon the breaking out of the War of 1812 he took the oath of allegiance\r\nto His Majesty. His ordinary pursuits were altogether insufficient for\r\nhis enthusiastic nature, and after the lapse of several years he removed\r\nto Kingston, and took up his abode there. He found an outlet for his\r\nsuperabundant energy through the medium of frequent contributions to the\r\npress. Among the best known of his writings are a series of letters on\r\npractical agriculture and political economy, originally contributed to a\r\nKingston newspaper, and subsequently republished in pamphlet form under\r\nthe title of \"The Prompter.\" The series of historical and topographical\r\nsketches forming the first half of the first volume of Gourlay's\r\n\"Statistical Account of Upper Canada\" are also from Mr. Bidwell's pen,\r\nand they are upon the whole the most valuable portion of the entire\r\nwork. He espoused Mr. Gourlay's cause with great fervour, and by his\r\nwritten and spoken words did much to arouse public sympathy for that\r\nunfortunate man, as well as to awaken abhorrence for the cruelty and\r\nselfishness of his persecutors. From that time forward he began to take\r\na more conspicuous part in politics than he had been accustomed to take\r\nsince his arrival in Canada. From the hustings and elsewhere he\r\nthundered against the Compact domination with an eloquence which\r\nthrilled his audiences. He soon made himself felt as a power in the\r\nland, and as one from whom the ruling faction had good reason to\r\napprehend more serious antagonism than they had ever had to encounter.\r\n\r\nSuch was the man chosen by the Reform element in Lennox and Addington,\r\nduring the summer of 1821, to represent its interests in the Provincial\r\nAssembly. The ensuing campaign was an exciting one, but at its close\r\nBarnabas Bidwell was the undoubted choice of a large majority of the\r\nelectors. This was a heavy blow to the Executive party. The Reformers\r\nwould now have a representative in the House who could not be cajoled or\r\nbullied. His eloquence, aggressiveness, intelligence and shrewdness\r\ncould not fail to produce a decided impression on the House and on the\r\ncountry. Would it not be well if he could be got rid of, as Thorpe and\r\nGourlay had been got rid of before him?\r\n\r\nDuring the progress of the election campaign, some of the main facts\r\nconnected with Mr. Bidwell's migration from Massachusetts to Upper\r\nCanada had become known to his opponents. The pretext afforded by these\r\ndisclosures was too good to be neglected. An emissary was despatched to\r\nBerkshire County, where there was no difficulty in ascertaining that he\r\nhad been Treasurer of the municipality; that he had been indicted for\r\nmisapplying public funds; that a warrant had thereupon been issued for\r\nhis apprehension; and that he had then fled beyond the jurisdiction.\r\nCertified copies of the indictment and of several other important\r\ndocuments bearing on the matter were obtained by the agent, and by him\r\nbrought over to Upper Canada. On the strength of the information and\r\ndocuments thus obtained a petition was filed against the election of Mr.\r\nBidwell, upon the ground that he was an alien and a fugitive from\r\njustice, who had moreover taken an oath of allegiance to the Government\r\nof the United States. The accused notwithstanding appeared in his place\r\nin the Assembly upon the opening of the session, and when the matter of\r\nthe petition came up for discussion he defended himself before the House\r\nwith an eloquence and pathos which stirred every heart. He declared, in\r\nlanguage and tones which left no doubt of his sincerity, that he was\r\nguiltless of the embezzlement with which he had been charged, and that\r\nthe accusation had been solely due to the machinations of a powerful\r\nclique of enemies. He further urged that, whatever might be the facts as\r\nto the charge, he had never been tried or convicted, and that the\r\nAssembly had no right to assume his guilt in the absence of positive\r\nproof. He admitted having taken the oath of allegiance to the Government\r\nof the United States, but urged that such an oath was required of every\r\nman assuming a public office in all civilized countries; that it applied\r\nonly to the period of his actual residence, and was no legitimate bar to\r\nhis advancement in another country. Since his arrival in Canada he had\r\ntaken an oath of allegiance to the King of Great Britain. That his\r\nloyalty was not open to suspicion was sufficiently manifest from the\r\nmere fact of his having been returned to Parliament by a constituency\r\nthe inhabitants whereof were largely composed of United Empire Loyalists\r\nand their immediate descendants. Such was the course of his argument,\r\nwhich from beginning to end was singularly lucid and clear. But all was\r\nunavailing. He was assailed by the Government party in language such as\r\nis rarely to be met with in the annals of Parliamentary debate in this\r\ncountry. Mr. Attorney-General Robinson went beyond any former effort of\r\nhis life in the way of vituperation, and overleapt the bounds of the\r\ncommonest decency. He proclaimed himself to be the son of a United\r\nEmpire Loyalist who had fought and bled for his country, and as\r\ntherefore being no fit company for runaway felons and pickpockets. His\r\nsympathy with himself was so great that the tears chased one another\r\ndown his cheeks as he was speaking. All the amiability which commonly\r\nmarked his intercourse with his fellowmen seemed to have utterly\r\ndeparted from him, and he towered above his seat in a perfect whirlwind\r\nof rage and fiery indignation. Mr. Bidwell's calm and temperate reply\r\nwas in striking contrast to the levin bolts which had been hurled at\r\nhim, and produced a marked effect upon his hearers. But the Compact\r\ncommanded a majority in the Assembly,[59] which sustained a motion for\r\nhis expulsion. And as it was well known that the electors of Lennox and\r\nAddington would again return him, and that he could not be permanently\r\nexcluded by any ordinary means, it was determined to disqualify him by\r\nspecial legislation. An Act was accordingly passed intituled \"An Act to\r\nrender ineligible to a seat in the Commons House of Assembly of this\r\nProvince certain descriptions of persons therein mentioned.\"[60] Among\r\nthe persons declared ineligible were those who had held any of the\r\nprincipal public offices in a foreign country, which was of course an\r\neffectual disqualification for Barnabas Bidwell, who, as already\r\nmentioned, had been Attorney-General of Massachusetts. It was a\r\nveritable Act of Exclusion, aimed at a particular person, and it served\r\nits purpose by keeping the obnoxious individual perpetually out of\r\npublic life.[61]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of Mr. Bidwell's expulsion a new election for Lennox and\r\nAddington became necessary. The writ was issued, and, to the chagrin and\r\ndisgust of the supporters of the Government, a new champion of popular\r\nrights appeared in the field in the person of Marshall Spring Bidwell,\r\nthe only son of the recently-expelled member. The new candidate was a\r\nyoung man of twenty-three years of age. He was a native of\r\nMassachusetts, and had accompanied his parents to Canada at the time of\r\ntheir migration in 1810. At an early age he had given proofs of the\r\npossession of splendid abilities. His father, who was exceedingly proud\r\nof the bright boy, had cultivated his faculties to the utmost, and by\r\nthe time that Marshall Spring Bidwell had attained his majority he was\r\nregarded by all who knew him as having a brilliant future before him. A\r\nyear before his candidature he had been called to the Provincial bar. He\r\nnow presented himself before the electors of Lennox and Addington in\r\nopposition to the Tory candidate, a gentleman named Clark. The combined\r\nmodesty and assurance displayed by young Bidwell throughout the contest\r\ngained for him many warm friends, while at the same time his earnestness\r\nand flowing eloquence proved that he was a true son of his father. He\r\nconducted the campaign with signal ability, and laid the foundation of a\r\nlasting reputation in the constituency. At the close of the poll the\r\nreturning-officer declared Mr. Clark to have been duly elected, but, as\r\nit was notorious that corrupt practices had been resorted to, a protest\r\nwas entered by the friends of the Reform candidate, who himself appeared\r\nin person at the bar of the House to conduct the argument. The result of\r\nthe enquiry was that the return was set aside and a new election\r\nordered. Young Bidwell so distinguished himself by his argument before\r\nthe House that the official party perceived that he was likely to be no\r\nless formidable as an opponent than his father would have been. When the\r\nnew election was held he again presented himself as a candidate, but\r\nfound that the returning-officer had received instructions to accept no\r\nvotes for him, upon the ground that he was an alien. The Tory candidate,\r\nMr. Ham, was accordingly returned; but another protest was filed, with a\r\nsimilar result. The election was once more set aside, and Lennox and\r\nAddington still remained without a Parliamentary representative. It had\r\nby this time become notorious that the whole power of the Executive was\r\nexerted to keep the Bidwells out of public life, and the conviction that\r\nsuch was the fact gave rise to a counter-movement on the part of the\r\nvictims. The friends of Reform bestirred themselves to such purpose that\r\nduring the session of 1823-24 an Act was passed[62] repealing the\r\nmeasure of two years before, and relaxing the conditions under which\r\npersons who had resided in or taken the oath of allegiance to a foreign\r\nstate should be eligible for election to the Provincial Parliament. It\r\nwas provided that a residence in the Province of seven years next before\r\nelection should render such persons eligible for membership in the\r\nAssembly. This clause removed all existing disqualifications from young\r\nMr. Bidwell; but his father still remained disqualified, for it was\r\nexpressly re-enacted that no person who had been a member of the Senate\r\nor House of Representatives of the United States, or who had held office\r\nin any of the executive departments of \"the United States of America, or\r\nany one of the said United States,\" should be capable of being elected\r\nto the Assembly. Under this clause the elder Bidwell was doubly\r\ndisqualified, for he had not only been Attorney-General of\r\nMassachusetts, but had also sat in Congress. It was much, however, that\r\nthe son was rendered eligible. A general election took place during the\r\nsummer of 1824, at which he was returned for the constituency which he\r\nthen contested for the third time. He continued to sit in Parliament\r\nfor eleven successive years. He is properly regarded as one of the\r\nfounders of the Reform party in Upper Canada, and by his eloquence, tact\r\nand discretion, no less than by the high respect in which his character\r\nwas held, he did much to advance the progress of Reform principles.\r\n\r\nThe general election of 1824 resulted in the return of a number of\r\nprominent Reformers who now for the first time came forward to take part\r\nin public affairs. It was evident that a spirit of Reform had been\r\nawakened, and that from this time forward every important public\r\nquestion was likely to have two sides to it.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous of all the new members was Mr. John Rolph, who had\r\nbeen returned as one of the representatives for the County of Middlesex.\r\nAs he played an important part in the event which forms the subject of\r\nthis work, and as he was one of the ablest men who have ever taken part\r\nin public affairs in this country, it is desirable to give some fuller\r\naccount of him than is to be found in the various books relating to the\r\nplace and times in which he lived.\r\n\r\nJohn Rolph was unquestionably one of the most extraordinary\r\npersonalities who have ever figured in the annals of Upper Canada. He\r\npossessed talents which, under favouring circumstances, would have made\r\nhim a marked man in either professional or public life in any country.\r\nChief among his qualifications may be mentioned a comprehensive, subtle\r\nintellect, high scholastic and professional attainments, a style of\r\neloquence which was at once ornate and logical, a noble and handsome\r\ncountenance, a voice of silvery sweetness and great power of modulation,\r\nand an address at once impressive, dignified and ingratiating. His\r\nkeenness of perception and his faculty for detecting the weak point in\r\nan argument were almost abnormal, while his power of eloquent and subtle\r\nexposition had no rival among the Canadian public men of those times.\r\nHis famous speech--to be hereafter more particularly referred\r\nto--delivered in the Assembly, in 1836, on the subject of the Clergy\r\nReserves, was one of the most powerful indictments ever heard within the\r\nwalls of a Canadian Parliament. His arraignment of Sir Francis Bond Head\r\nbefore the same body early in the following year was hardly less\r\nimpressive. He was of a full habit of body, even in comparative youth,\r\nand though he was rather under than above the middle height, there was\r\na dignity and even majesty in his presence that gave the world assurance\r\nof a strong man, while it at the same time effectually repelled unseemly\r\nfamiliarity. A pair of deep clear blue eyes, surmounted by rather heavy\r\neyebrows, glanced out from beneath his smooth and expansive forehead. He\r\nhad light brown hair, a well-moulded chin, a firmly-set nose, and a\r\nsomewhat large and flexible mouth, capable of imparting to the\r\ncountenance great variety of expression. Such, according to the\r\nuniversal testimony of those who knew him, and according to portraits\r\npainted from life and preserved in his family, was the John Rolph of\r\nfifty to sixty years ago.\r\n\r\nThere was unquestionably a _per contra_. Though he was a man of many\r\nfriends, and was the repository of many familiar confidences, there was\r\nprobably no human being--not even the wife of his bosom--who ever\r\npossessed John Rolph's entire confidence. There was about him no such\r\nthing as self-abandonment. This was not because he was devoid of natural\r\npassions or affections, or even of warm friendship, for he was a kind,\r\nif not a tender husband and father, and there were many persons whom he\r\nheld in very high esteem, and for whom he cheerfully made great\r\nsacrifices. But the quality of caution seems to have been\r\npreternaturally developed within his breast. No man was ever less open\r\nto the imputation of wearing his heart upon his sleeve. He had a\r\ntemperament of great equableness, and doubtless felt much more deeply\r\nthan was suspected, even by those who were constantly about him. To the\r\nouter world he was ever self-possessed, calm and dignified, of pleasant\r\nand amiable manners, and not deficient in good-fellowship, but seldom or\r\nnever abandoning himself to frolicsomeness or fun. His smile had a\r\nwinsome sweetness about it, but it was a very rare occurrence indeed for\r\nhim to indulge in anything approaching to hearty laughter. His\r\nself-control was marvellous. He was never surprised or startled, never\r\ndismayed by unexpected intelligence, never taken off his guard. Yet he\r\npossessed great dramatic talent, and in his addresses to juries and\r\npublic audiences could successfully simulate the most contradictory\r\nfeelings and emotions. One who judged him simply from such exhibitions\r\nas these might well have set him down for an emotional and impetuous\r\nman, apt to be led away by the fleeting passions and weaknesses of the\r\nmoment. Yet no one coming to such a conclusion would have had any\r\nconception of his real character and idiosyncrasies. He certainly never\r\nacted without motive, but his motives were sometimes dark and\r\nunfathomable to everyone but himself. Not one among his contemporaries\r\nwas able to take his moral and intellectual measure with anything\r\napproaching to completeness; and throughout the entire length and\r\nbreadth of Canadian biography there is no man of equal eminence\r\nrespecting whose real individuality so little is known.\r\n\r\nMr. Rolph's peculiarities were probably inherent, for the facts of his\r\nearly life, so far as known, afford no clue to the reading of the\r\nriddle. He was the second son in a family consisting of eighteen\r\nchildren, and was born at Grovesend, in the market town of Thornbury,\r\nGloucestershire, England, on the 4th of March, 1793. His father, Thomas\r\nRolph, was a physician of some local repute, who seems to have been\r\nimpelled to emigrate in consequence of the impossibility of making any\r\nsuitable provision in England for so numerous a progeny. The ascertained\r\nfacts with reference to John Rolph's early life in England are\r\nsingularly meagre. He accompanied his parents to Canada some time prior\r\nto the War of 1812, for he served as a volunteer during the early part\r\nof that conflict, and was for some months a paymaster of militia. During\r\nthe progress of the war he was taken prisoner by the enemy, and was\r\ndetained in custody for a short time at Batavia, in the State of New\r\nYork. An exchange of prisoners having been effected, he was set at\r\nliberty. After his liberation he returned to England, where he entered\r\none of the colleges of the University of Cambridge; and, though he seems\r\nto have left there without taking a degree, he was recognized as a young\r\nman of very remarkable and precocious intellectual powers, likely to\r\nbecome conspicuous in after-life. He absorbed knowledge with marvellous\r\nfacility, and never forgot anything he had learned. After leaving\r\ncollege he repaired to London, where he was entered as a student-at-law,\r\nand was in due time called to the bar of the Inner Temple. Like Bacon,\r\nhe seems to have taken all knowledge to be his province, for, not\r\nsatisfied with having acquired what, in so young a man, was accounted a\r\nwide knowledge of jurisprudence, he studied for some time under Sir\r\nAstley Cooper, and was enrolled as a member of the Royal College of\r\nSurgeons. He soon afterwards returned to Canada, and took up his abode\r\non a lot of land in the Township of Charlotteville, about midway between\r\nthe villages of Turkey Point and Vittoria, in what is now the County of\r\nNorfolk, but which then and for long afterwards formed part of the\r\nTalbot District. In Michaelmas Term of 1821 he was called to the bar of\r\nUpper Canada, and for some years thereafter he appears to have practised\r\nthe two professions of law and medicine concurrently. His great\r\nacquirements and pleasant manners made him a favourite with all classes\r\nof the people, and caused him to be regarded as a genuine acquisition to\r\nthe district in which he resided. He became the professional adviser and\r\nfamiliar friend of Colonel Thomas Talbot, founder of the Talbot\r\nSettlement, and was one of the originators of the Talbot Anniversary,\r\nestablished in 1817, and kept up for more than twenty years thereafter,\r\nin honour of the day of the Colonel's arrival at Port Talbot--the 21st\r\nof May, 1803. The Colonel was not, in the strict sense of the term, a\r\npolitician, but he was a member of the Legislative Council, and\r\nnaturally supported the official party; whereas Rolph, though a man of\r\nequable mind, and by no means constitutionally inclined towards\r\nRadicalism, had much better opportunities for mixing with the people\r\nthan had Colonel Talbot, and his keen eye revealed to him many official\r\nabuses which did not commend themselves to his sense of justice. It is\r\nprobable that differences of opinion on public questions led to their\r\nultimate estrangement. At all events, Rolph espoused the side of the\r\npeople, and declared himself a foe to the Family Compact policy, and\r\nfrom that time forward the intimacy between him and Colonel Talbot seems\r\nto have grown less and less. The Gourlay prosecutions aroused Rolph's\r\nhot indignation, which he did not hesitate to express with much freedom\r\nwhithersoever he went. Being a brilliant and eloquent talker, strong in\r\nopinion and logical in argument, he made many converts to his views, the\r\nnumber of whom was not lessened by the course of treatment adopted\r\ntowards the Bidwells. It seems to have been about this time that he took\r\nup his abode at Dundas, where he subsequently resided for many years.\r\nWhen the general elections of 1824 took place the Reformers of Middlesex\r\nbrought out John Rolph and Captain John Matthews, both of whom were\r\nreturned at the head of the poll.\r\n\r\nRolph made his presence felt in the Assembly from the time of taking his\r\nseat there. He was then thirty-one years of age, and of a compact,\r\nwell-built figure, inclining to portliness. His face was at once\r\nhandsome and intellectual, and his presence carried with it a suggestion\r\nof undoubted power. He spoke comparatively seldom during his early\r\nParliamentary sessions, but when he did speak it was always with effect.\r\nHis diction was singularly luminous and expressive, and would have\r\nattracted attention in any public assembly in the world. There was a\r\nclear metallic ring in his voice which did full justice to the language\r\nemployed, and there were few empty benches in the House when it was\r\nknown that Rolph was to speak.\r\n\r\nHis colleague from Middlesex, though a staunch Reformer, was a man of\r\nvery different cast. Captain Matthews was a retired officer of the royal\r\nartillery, who had seen twenty-seven years' service. At a very early\r\nperiod of his residence in Upper Canada he had become disgusted with\r\nFamily Compact rule, and had spoken his mind on the subject with much\r\nfreedom. Being a resident of the County of Middlesex, and being held in\r\nmuch esteem there among the adherents of Liberal principles, he was\r\ninduced to offer himself along with Dr. Rolph at the general election of\r\n1824 as one of the candidates for the county. His candidature was\r\nsuccessful, and he became very popular in the House, though the texture\r\nof his mind was somewhat light and airy, and he was not well fitted,\r\neither by nature or by training, to deal with such grave constitutional\r\nquestions as were continually forcing themselves upon public attention.\r\n\r\nAnother prominent Reformer who now took his seat in Parliament for the\r\nfirst time was Peter Perry, who had been returned as young Marshall\r\nBidwell's colleague in the representation of Lennox and Addington.\r\nAlthough thirty-four years have elapsed since his death, Mr. Perry is\r\nstill well remembered by the older generation of our politicians. During\r\nthe twelve years succeeding his entry into public life he was one of the\r\nmost conspicuous Reformers in the Province. Though not possessed of a\r\nliberal education, and though his demeanour and address were marred by a\r\nsort of impetuous coarseness, he was master of a rude, vigorous\r\neloquence which under certain conditions was far more effective than the\r\nmost polished oratory would have been. He was certainly the ablest stump\r\norator of his time in this country, and there was no man in the Reform\r\nranks who could so effectively conduct a difficult election campaign.\r\nNo man was more dreaded by his opponents, more especially by those who\r\nhad to encounter him while a contest was pending. It may here be added\r\nthat he continued to take an active part in politics down to a short\r\ntime before his death in 1851, and that he rendered great services to\r\nthe cause of Reform, but in the years following the Union of the\r\nProvinces he was overshadowed by Robert Baldwin, whose social position,\r\nspotless reputation and disinterestedness of purpose combined to place\r\nhim on a pedestal beyond the reach of ordinary politicians. Peter Perry,\r\nhowever, while yielding a loyal support to Mr. Baldwin, continued to the\r\nend of his life to fight his political battles in his own way. The\r\nsincerity of his convictions was beyond any sort of question, and his\r\nshrewdness, experience and hard common sense caused his opinions to be\r\nregarded with respect, even by such men as Rolph, Baldwin and the\r\nBidwells.\r\n\r\nMr. Perry was a native Upper Canadian, having been born at Ernestown in\r\n1793, during the early part of Governor Simcoe's administration of\r\naffairs. He was the son of a U. E. Loyalist, and was brought up on a\r\nfarm, at a time when public schools were few and far between in the\r\nrural districts. He grew to manhood without having acquired much in the\r\nway of education, but the quickness of his parts and the soundness of\r\nhis judgment did much to atone for his want of regular school training.\r\nHe began to take an active interest in public affairs at an early age,\r\nand before he was thirty he had acquired wide notoriety as a\r\nstrongly-pronounced Reformer. Living in the same part of the country as\r\nthe Bidwells, he took a warm interest in their candidature. As his\r\npolitical ideas coincided with theirs, and as his rough eloquence had\r\nalready made him well known throughout the constituency, he espoused\r\ntheir side in the successive election contests, and at the general\r\nelection of 1824 was himself returned to the Assembly as the colleague\r\nof the brilliant young lawyer.\r\n\r\nIn addition to John Rolph, Marshall Spring Bidwell, Captain John\r\nMatthews and Peter Perry, a number of other advocates of Reform\r\nprinciples were returned at the general election of 1824. For the first\r\ntime in Upper Canadian annals, it was manifest not only that the\r\nReformers had a majority in point of numbers in the Assembly, but that\r\nthey had a decided preponderance of ability. No adherent of the official\r\nparty--not even the Attorney-General, John Beverley Robinson--was a\r\nmatch for Rolph or Bidwell, to say nothing of Perry, whose oratory was\r\nof an altogether different complexion, though scarcely less effective.\r\nUpon the meeting of the Houses the numerical strength of the respective\r\nparties was fairly tested by the vote on the Speakership. The Reformers\r\nnominated as their candidate John Willson, one of the members for\r\nWentworth. Mr. Willson was an unpretending farmer, of strong political\r\nconvictions, but of good sense and calm judgment, who had allied himself\r\nwith the Reformers, and who might safely be depended upon to discharge\r\nthe duties incidental to the Speakership with judicial impartiality. The\r\nvote stood twenty-one to nineteen, the majority of two being in Mr.\r\nWillson's favour. The Reformers felt that they had achieved a triumph,\r\nand were accordingly jubilant; but they soon found that the mere control\r\nof the Assembly signified very little in the absence of Executive\r\nresponsibility. The Legislative Council interposed its dead weight, and\r\nvetoed one bill after another sent up by the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Reform preponderance in the Assembly, however, and the bringing\r\ntogether of the leading supporters of Liberal principles, led to the\r\nestablishment of an organized body of Reformers, which from that time\r\nforward made its existence felt throughout the constituencies, and\r\npresented an obstacle to the continued rule of the Compact. Conspicuous\r\namong the Fathers of Reform, in addition to John Rolph, Peter Perry,\r\nCaptain Matthews and the two Bidwells, were Doctor William Warren\r\nBaldwin, his son Robert, and William Lyon Mackenzie. None of the three\r\nlast-named gentlemen was at this time in Parliament, but they were\r\nnevertheless all able to render very valuable services to Reform\r\nprinciples--the first two by reason of their wealth and high social\r\nposition, and the third from the fact that he was the publisher of a\r\nnewspaper, and that he was a man of strong opinions and superabundant\r\nenergy in giving expression to them.\r\n\r\nThe elder Baldwin was a gentleman of high character and social position,\r\nresident at York. He had emigrated from Ireland to Canada towards the\r\nclose of the last century, and, like Mr. Rolph, had for some time\r\npractised law and medicine concurrently. He achieved considerable\r\nsuccess, both pecuniarily and otherwise, and, notwithstanding his\r\npolitical principles, which were of a decidedly advanced character, he\r\nwas respected by the entire community of the little Provincial capital.\r\nThe family to which he belonged were well known in Ireland for their\r\nadherence to advanced political doctrines, and he himself remained true\r\nto family traditions. At a time when it required no slight courage to\r\nespouse the Liberal side in York, Dr. Baldwin was always to be found in\r\nthe ranks of Reform. He was wealthy, as, in addition to the property\r\nwhich he had personally accumulated, he had succeeded, by bequest, to\r\nthe bulk of the large possessions of the Honourable Peter Russell--whose\r\nmethod of doing good unto himself has already been glanced at--and of\r\nthat gentleman's maiden sister Elizabeth. Miss Russell resided in Dr.\r\nBaldwin's family during the last few years of her life, and survived\r\nuntil 1822. The Russells and the Baldwins were remotely connected by\r\nties of relationship, and as neither the Administrator nor his sister\r\never married, there was nothing strange in the disposition made by them\r\nof their property.\r\n\r\nHigh as Dr. Baldwin stood in the Reform ranks, however, he was destined\r\nto be eclipsed by his more distinguished son. It is safe to say that no\r\npublic man in Canada has ever gained so enviable a reputation as\r\nattaches to the name of Robert Baldwin. As was intimated two or three\r\npages back, he stood upon a lofty pedestal, and was a very man _per se_.\r\nAnd this high position he attained, not by means of brilliant oratory,\r\nkeenness of perception, or subtle comprehensiveness of judgment. No one\r\nhas ever pretended to claim for him any special intellectual greatness\r\nof any kind. He was a plain man, of abilities not much above the\r\naverage, who possessed strong convictions, and whose high principles,\r\nsterling honesty and disinterestedness of purpose were unimpeachable.\r\nHad he been a member of the British House of Commons during Sir Robert\r\nWalpole's regime, the proverbial dictum of that high priest of\r\ncorruption would never have been uttered, for certainly no man would\r\never have dreamed of offering a bribe to Robert Baldwin. He has been in\r\nhis grave for more than a quarter of a century; thirty-four years have\r\nelapsed since his withdrawal from public life; yet he is still referred\r\nto by adherents of both political parties in Canada as a statesman of\r\nunblemished integrity, whose character was without spot, and in whose\r\nbosom was no guile. He more than once occupied the foremost position in\r\nthe public eye. During much of his career a fierce light beat upon him,\r\nyet failed to disclose anything whereof the most august character in\r\nhistory would have had any cause for feeling ashamed. As I have said\r\nelsewhere: \"We can still point to him with the admiration due to a man\r\nwho, during a time of the grossest political corruption, took a foremost\r\npart in our public affairs, and who yet preserved his integrity\r\nuntarnished. We can point to him as the man who, if not the actual\r\nauthor of Responsible Government in Canada, yet spent the best years of\r\nhis life in contending for it, and who contributed more than any other\r\nperson to make that project an accomplished fact. We can point to him as\r\none who, though a politician by predilection and by profession, never\r\nstooped to disreputable practices, either to win votes or to maintain\r\nhimself in office. Robert Baldwin was a man who was not only incapable\r\nof falsehood or meanness to gain his ends, but who was to the last\r\ndegree intolerant of such practices on the part of his warmest\r\nsupporters. If intellectual greatness cannot be claimed for him, moral\r\ngreatness was most indisputably his. Every action of his life was marked\r\nby sincerity and good faith, alike toward friend and foe. He was not\r\nonly true to others, but was from first to last true to himself....\r\nRobert Baldwin was neither a bigot nor a fanatic, but he was in the best\r\nand truest sense of the word a Christian. He was strict in his\r\nobservance of religious duties, and brought up his children to seek\r\nthose things which make for righteousness, rather than the things of\r\nthis world. His piety was an ever-present influence in his life, and was\r\npractically manifested in his daily walk and conversation. As we\r\ncontemplate the fifty-four years which made up the measure of his\r\nearthly span, we cannot fail to be impressed by its uniform consistency,\r\nits thorough conscientiousness, its devotion to high and noble objects.\r\nIt is a grand thing to acquire a famous name, but it is a much grander\r\nthing to live a pure and noble life; and in estimating the character of\r\nRobert Baldwin it should be remembered that he was not merely a\r\nstatesman and a lawyer, but was, over and above all else, a man and a\r\nChristian.\"[63]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing account, be it understood, applies to a later period. At\r\nthe date of the general election in 1824 Robert Baldwin was still a\r\nyoung man, whose reputation, professional and political, was yet to be\r\nmade. He had not even been called to the bar, and was still a student in\r\nhis father's office. Notwithstanding his youth, however--he was only in\r\nhis twenty-first year--he had given some thought to the political\r\nquestions of the time, and had even begun to look forward to the\r\npossibility of an ultimate political career. His father, from whom he\r\nhad learned many political lessons, had recently become very wealthy\r\nthrough the death of Miss Russell, as already mentioned. Much of his\r\nwealth consisted of landed property. Robert was the first-born child of\r\nhis parents, and, as the law of primogeniture was then in force in Upper\r\nCanada,[64] it was to be anticipated that he would succeed to large\r\npossessions, and would be independent of any income arising from his own\r\nexertions. He bore an honoured name, and it was tolerably certain that,\r\nunder such a combination of circumstances, he would sooner or later find\r\nhis way to Parliament. He had already imbibed what were in those days\r\nconsidered as advanced Liberal views, and was in full accord with his\r\nfather, who had to a large extent moulded his opinions. He was present\r\nat the meetings of the Reform members held during the first session\r\nfollowing the elections of 1824, for the purpose of organization. It was\r\nthen that a distinct Reform Party, with common objects and a specific\r\npolicy, may be said to have been formed in this Province. There had been\r\nUpper Canadian Reformers from the very foundation of the Province, but\r\nno Reform Party can strictly be said to have had an existence prior to\r\nthe latter part of the year 1824.\r\n\r\nNo man was more conspicuous in contributing to the founding of the\r\nReform Party than was William Lyon Mackenzie, whose personality yet\r\nremains to be considered. Owing in some measure to the force of\r\ncircumstances, but chiefly to his own energy, impulsiveness and love of\r\nnotoriety, Mr. Mackenzie's name and achievements have become more widely\r\nknown than have those of many abler and wiser men. He was the only\r\nchild of humble parents, and was born at Springfield, a suburb of\r\nDundee, in Forfarshire, Scotland, on the 12th of March, 1795. When he\r\nwas four weeks old his father died, leaving him and his mother wholly\r\nunprovided for, insomuch that they were dependent upon the bounty of\r\nrelatives. To adopt his own language, poverty and adversity were his\r\nnurses, and want and misery were his familiar friends. \"It is among the\r\nearliest of my recollections,\" wrote he in 1824, \"that I lay in bed one\r\nmorning during the grievous famine in Britain in 1800-1, while my poor\r\nmother took from our large kist the handsome plaid of the tartan of our\r\nclan, which in her early life her own hands had spun, and went and sold\r\nit for a trifle, to obtain for us a little coarse barley meal, whereof\r\nto make our scanty breakfast; and of another time during the same famine\r\nwhen she left me at home crying from hunger, and for (I think) eight\r\nshillings sold a handsome and hitherto carefully preserved priest-gray\r\ncoat of my father's, to get us a little food.\" His mother, from whom he\r\ninherited his most salient peculiarities, was a woman of strongly-marked\r\ncharacter. She was endowed by nature with a high temper, and with a\r\ntendency to act from impulse rather than from reason. To these qualities\r\nwere added great energy and strength of will. She brought up her son in\r\nthe straitest of theological creeds, which left a certain permanent\r\nmental impress upon him, though during the last quarter of a century of\r\nhis life he wandered far afield from the religious teachings of his\r\nchildhood. He seems to have been born with a genuine love for knowledge,\r\nfor, notwithstanding the inauspicious surroundings of his youth, he\r\ncontrived to acquire a better education than was commonly obtainable by\r\nlads in his rank of life in Scotland in those times. The education thus\r\nacquired was almost to the end of his days supplemented by reading and\r\nstudy. As soon as he was old enough to enter upon employment he became\r\nan assistant in a draper's shop, after which he filled various temporary\r\nsituations which led to nothing. When only nineteen he opened a small\r\nstore on his own account at Alyth, a village about twenty miles from\r\nDundee. This he conducted for about three years, by which time it had\r\nbecome apparent that the business could not be successfully carried on,\r\nso he abandoned it and removed to England. There he spent more than two\r\nyears, during some part of which he acted as clerk to a coal company.\r\nIn the spring of 1820 he sailed for Canada, where he was destined to\r\ngain great notoriety, and to become an important factor in the moulding\r\nof public opinion.\r\n\r\nIn a new country like Canada a young man of Mackenzie's energy was soon\r\nable to make his presence felt. After being employed for a short time on\r\nthe survey of the Lachine Canal, he opened a store at York, whence he\r\nremoved to Dundas, and entered on a more extensive mercantile business\r\nin partnership with Mr. John Lesslie, the style of the firm being\r\n\"Mackenzie & Lesslie.\" His mercantile venture in Dundas was fairly\r\nsuccessful. During his residence there he married Miss Isabel Baxter, a\r\nnative of Dundee, after a brief courtship of three weeks. In the spring\r\nof 1823 the firm of Mackenzie & Lesslie was dissolved, and for a few\r\nmonths thereafter the senior partner carried on business by himself. In\r\nthe autumn of the same year he removed to Queenston, where he embarked\r\nin business by opening a general store. The store had not been many\r\nmonths in operation before its proprietor abandoned commercial pursuits\r\nand embraced the life of a journalist. This change seems to have been\r\nthe result of some deliberation, and it must be admitted that Mr.\r\nMackenzie possessed considerable aptitude for the new field of labour\r\nwhich he had chosen. His writing, though very unequal, and sometimes\r\nexceedingly verbose and amateurish in point of style, was almost always\r\ndirect and easy to understand. His observation was keen, and he had\r\ntaken a warm interest in politics ever since his arrival in the country.\r\nThough many of his views were what would now be considered Toryish and\r\nout of date, they were then classed by the Compact and their adherents\r\nas ultra-Radical and revolutionary. He had formed the acquaintance of\r\nRolph, Perry, the Bidwells, and other prominent Reformers, by all of\r\nwhom the sincerity of his political professions were regarded as being\r\nbeyond question. The first number of his newspaper, which was christened\r\n_The Colonial Advocate_, made its appearance on the 18th of May, 1824.\r\nIt consisted of thirty-two pages, and, although its owner had neither\r\nreceived nor sought a single subscriber, he issued an edition of twelve\r\nhundred copies. Whether he embarked in newspaper life at this particular\r\ntime with a view to influencing votes during the impending general\r\nelection cannot now be known with certainty. Probably enough this may\r\nhave been one of his motives, which were doubtless of a mixed nature.\r\nThat he was sincere in his advocacy of Reform must in all fairness be\r\nconceded, though his itch for notoriety must always be considered in\r\nreviewing and estimating his actions. This tendency of his mind would\r\nreadily lead him to select journalism as his vocation in life, more\r\nespecially as he found that his opinions were regarded as having some\r\nvalue. As compared with his life in Britain, his career in Canada had\r\nbeen an undoubted success. He had acquired some property, and was in\r\nfair pecuniary circumstances. From the inner side of his counter he had\r\nbeen in the habit of holding forth to his customers on the political and\r\nother questions of the day, and had found that his arguments were\r\naccepted by a majority of the unlettered yeomen of Wentworth as being\r\nunanswerable. He was looked up to as a man of weight and influence in\r\nthe community, and the consciousness of this was naturally gratifying to\r\nthe whilom shop-boy of Dumfries. He felt incited to address larger\r\naudiences than any which had hitherto listened to him. The time seemed\r\npropitious for the establishment of a Reform newspaper. There was a\r\ngeneral awakening in the direction of Reform, extending over the greater\r\npart of the Province. There could be no sort of doubt that public\r\nopinion was in a state of transition: that many people had begun to look\r\nforward to a time when Responsible Government would be conceded, and\r\nwhen the domination of the Compact would be no more. When that\r\nmuch-wished-for epoch should arrive, those who had been the means of\r\nbringing it about, or of hastening its advent, would stand high among\r\nthe Reformers of Upper Canada. Who would be likely to stand higher than\r\na clever and aspiring man who was at once editor and proprietor of the\r\nleading organ of Liberal opinion in the Province? Such a personage might\r\ncommand anything within the power of his party to grant. That he would\r\nsoon be able to write his way into Parliament was a foregone conclusion;\r\nand a seat in Parliament appeared a very proud distinction in the eyes\r\nof one whose past surroundings had been so far removed from such a\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\nThat these, or something like these, were among the chief motives\r\nwhereby Mr. Mackenzie was actuated in establishing _The Colonial\r\nAdvocate_ seems tolerably certain. Nor is there anything unusual or\r\ncensurable in such an ambition. The labourer is worthy of his hire, and\r\nno labourer is better entitled to a full recompense than is the man who,\r\nthrough long and weary years, struggles to win success for a depressed\r\nand righteous cause. That he was not devoid of a spirit of sincere\r\npatriotism is evident, alike from his words and his deeds. He had\r\namassed a few hundreds of pounds, and was in no dread of poverty, being\r\nsanguine and self-confident to an uncommon degree. He ardently longed to\r\nsee this fair colony rescued from the thraldom under which it groaned.\r\nIn a letter[65] written many years afterwards, when he was an outlaw and\r\nan exile, he gives his own version of the motives which impelled him to\r\nembark upon what he calls \"the stormy sea of politics.\" \"I had long,\" he\r\nwrites, \"seen the country in the hands of a few shrewd, crafty, covetous\r\nmen, under whose management one of the most lovely and desirable\r\nsections of America remained a comparative desert. The most obvious\r\npublic improvements were stayed; dissension was created among classes;\r\ncitizens were banished and imprisoned in defiance of all law; the people\r\nhad been long forbidden, under severe pains and penalties, from meeting\r\nanywhere to petition for justice; large estates were wrested from their\r\nowners in utter contempt of even the forms of the courts; the Church of\r\nEngland, the adherents of which were few, monopolized as much of the\r\nlands of the colony as all the religious houses and dignitaries of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church had had the control of in Scotland at the era of\r\nthe Reformation; other sects were treated with contempt and scarcely\r\ntolerated; a sordid band of land-jobbers grasped the soil as their\r\npatrimony, and with a few leading officials, who divided the public\r\nrevenue among themselves, formed the Family Compact, and were the avowed\r\nenemies of common schools, of civil and religious liberty, of all\r\nlegislative or other checks to their own will. Other men had opposed,\r\nand been converted by them. At nine-and-twenty I might have united with\r\nthem, but chose rather to join the oppressed, nor have I ever regretted\r\nthat choice, or wavered from the object of my early pursuit.\"\r\n\r\nA man entertaining such views as these, more especially a man of energy\r\nand intelligence, with a newspaper at his back, could not fail to be\r\nacceptable to the little knot of politicians who formed the nucleus of\r\nthe Reform Party of Upper Canada. Mr. Mackenzie was cordially welcomed\r\ninto the ranks, and was soon recognized as a most useful and valuable\r\nacquisition thereto. He could make no pretence to the various learning,\r\nfine presence, subtle intellect or polished eloquence of Rolph, nor even\r\nto the high but less marked qualities of the Bidwells, but the time was\r\nat hand when he was to prove that he possessed the power to move\r\naudiences, by his voice as well as by his pen. In person he would have\r\nbeen pronounced by a casual passer-by to be rather insignificant, being\r\nexceedingly short in stature, and not well proportioned as to his\r\nfigure, which was slight, wiry, and--owing to a restless habit and a\r\nhighly-strung nervous system--seldom in repose. Still, no one who\r\ncontemplated his features with attention would ever have dreamed of\r\npronouncing him commonplace. His intellectual vigour and determination\r\nwere attested by his large head, massive brow, keen, light-blue eyes and\r\nfirmly-set mouth. His physical energy was placed equally beyond doubt by\r\nthe nervous activity above mentioned. Until he was long past the prime\r\nof his manhood he was never still for many consecutive moments during\r\nhis waking hours. When labouring under any unusual excitement his frame\r\nseemed to be set on steel springs. As his temper was easily aroused, it\r\nwas no uncommon thing to see him in one of these phases of excitement.\r\nBut though he was thus quickly moved to anger, it could not with justice\r\nbe said that his temper was bad, for, so far from being implacable, he\r\nwas readily appeased, and always quick to forget and forgive.\r\nAltogether, he had an active but ill-balanced organization. His\r\nsympathies were too quick and strong for his judgment, and he frequently\r\nacted from impulse and hot blood. From his cradle to his grave he was\r\nnever fit to walk alone and without guidance through any great\r\nemergency.\r\n\r\nNo two human beings could well be more unlike than were William Lyon\r\nMackenzie and John Rolph. They were compelled to work together in a\r\ncommon cause for many years, but the two entities were thoroughly\r\nantagonistic, and there was never much personal liking between them. The\r\nstructure of their bodies was not more dissimilar than was that of their\r\nminds. The one, slight, wiry, and ever in motion, seemed as though it\r\nmight be blown hither and thither by any strong current. The other,\r\nsolid almost to portliness, was suggestive of fixity--of\r\nself-dependence, and unsusceptibility to outside influences. The one was\r\nsuggestive of being in a great measure the creature of circumstances;\r\nthe other of being a law unto himself--one who would be more likely to\r\ninfluence circumstances than to be influenced by them. Mackenzie's\r\nnature, though it could not strictly be called a shallow one, at any\r\nrate lay near the surface, and its characters were not hard to decipher,\r\neven upon a brief acquaintance. There were depths in Rolph's nature\r\nwhich were never fathomed by those nearest and dearest to him--possibly\r\nnot even by himself. Mackenzie seems to have long regarded Rolph with a\r\nsort of distant awe--as a Sphinx, close, oracular, inscrutable. Rolph\r\nevidently estimated Mackenzie correctly, as one whose politics were\r\nfounded upon deeply-rooted convictions, and not upon mere opinions,\r\nalthough he would probably have found it difficult to subject those\r\nopinions to a rigid analysis; as one whose energy and journalistic\r\nresources might be turned to good account in the cause of Reform, but\r\nwhose discretion was not always to be relied on. This estimate, indeed,\r\nwas sufficiently obvious to any one who maintained frequent or familiar\r\nrelations with Mackenzie, and was concurred in by most, if not all, of\r\nhis friends. His earnestness and good faith, however, were manifest to\r\nall who knew him, and these were sufficient to cover much more culpable\r\nweaknesses than any which he had hitherto displayed.\r\n\r\nHaving now become acquainted with some of the FATHERS of Reform, it is\r\ndesirable to cast a momentary glance at the material which went to the\r\ncomposition of the Reform Party generally. That material was of the most\r\nheterogeneous character imaginable. It included a few U. E. Loyalists of\r\nadvanced opinions, and their descendants; but the bone and sinew were\r\nmade up of more recent immigrants from Great Britain and the United\r\nStates. The organization of the party, such as it was, was of too recent\r\na date at this time to admit of any absolute unanimity of opinion on all\r\nquestions of public policy having been arrived at among so numerous a\r\nbody. On one cardinal point, however, all were agreed: it was in the\r\nhighest degree desirable that the Canadian constitution should be more\r\nclosely assimilated to that of the mother-country, and that the\r\nExecutive Council should be made responsible to the popular branch of\r\nthe Legislature. True, there was a small element--almost entirely made\r\nup of immigrants from across the border--who held republican theories,\r\nbut no class of the community clamoured more loudly for Responsible\r\nGovernment than did the advocates of republicanism, very few of whom\r\nregarded their opinions as coming within the domain of practical\r\npolitics in Upper Canada. On the question of the Clergy Reserves there\r\nwas less uniformity of sentiment. Many sincere Reformers disapproved of\r\nthe voluntary principle, and believed in a State provision for the\r\nClergy,[66] though very few of them went so far in that direction as to\r\ndefend the exclusive pretensions of the Church of England. On this and\r\nother important public questions, however, the diversity of opinion\r\nhenceforth became less and leas from year to year. In point of numbers\r\nthe adherents of Reform principles constituted a majority of the\r\ninhabitants of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe _Advocate_ was only six months old when its proprietor removed to\r\nYork. If any good service was to be done to Reform by his means it was\r\nclear that the Provincial capital must be the seat of his operations.\r\nThe removal took place in November, 1824, and in the following January\r\nthe new Parliament met for the first time. Much of the interval was\r\nspent by the Reformers in preparations for organization. In all these\r\nproceedings Mr. Mackenzie took an active and prominent part. He also\r\nassumed, to a greater extent than he had previously done, the _role_ of\r\na public censor, and, in the columns of his paper, opened a hot fire\r\nupon the official party and their myrmidons. His writing was \"personal\r\njournalism,\" with a vengeance, for he usually expressed himself in the\r\nfirst person singular, and directed his animadversions against any one\r\nwho, for the time being, happened to have attracted his notice. He wrote\r\nvery erratically, and from the impulse of the moment; in one number\r\nlauding some particular personage in extravagant terms, and in\r\nsubsequent numbers assailing the self-same individual in language which\r\ncertainly reflected no credit upon the writer. Sometimes he even\r\nextended his attacks to the friends and relatives of those who had\r\nbecome obnoxious to him. In all this he merely followed the example of\r\nhis opponents, from whom better things might have been expected, but he\r\ncertainly lessened his influence, even among his friends and\r\nfellow-labourers, by his onslaughts upon particular individuals. There\r\ncan be no manner of doubt, however, that he achieved his object of\r\nholding some of his opponents up to public ridicule, and that in at\r\nleast one or two instances he was the means of affecting votes in the\r\nAssembly thereby. To what extent, if at all, his efforts in this\r\ndirection contributed to the election of Mr. Willson, the Reform\r\ncandidate for the Speakership in the Assembly, already referred to, is\r\nnot easy to say. That his deliverances may have produced an effect upon\r\none or two waverers, and thereby have brought about the desired\r\nresult--the vote, it will be remembered, was a close one, standing\r\ntwenty-one to nineteen[67]--is possible enough. It is at all events\r\ncertain that the combined action of the Reform Party in and out of\r\nParliament produced early and specific consequences. On a number of\r\nquestions the Government found themselves confronted by a hostile\r\nmajority considerably greater than they had encountered on the\r\nSpeakership. But these seeming triumphs were of no immediate advantage\r\nto the Opposition. Let the majority against the Government be ever so\r\ngreat in the Assembly, the official policy remained the same. The Upper\r\nHouse rejected Bill after Bill which had been passed by the Lower, and\r\nthe Executive clung to their places in undisturbed serenity.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[57] _Ante_, p. 44.\r\n\r\n[58] The repealing statute is 1 Geo.

A hired pimp was despatched to Boston to\r\nhunt up slanders, originating in political feuds there. Mr. Bidwell was\r\nput on his trial before a corrupt House, and when thus you saw your\r\ninnocent victim within your reach, then it was you lifted up the\r\nflood-gates of your loyal wrath, and let your vengeance fall upon his\r\ndevoted head. Then it was that the overflowings of your 'native\r\nmalignancy' hurled the tears of loyalty down your pallid cheeks. Then it\r\nwas that your natural flippancy gave rapid birth to the most gross,\r\nunqualified and unjustifiable abuse I ever heard heaped, not only upon a\r\nmember of Parliament, but even upon the commonest member of society. 'Am\r\nI,' said you, 'the son of a U. E. Loyalist, who fought and bled for his\r\ncountry, to sit within these walls with disloyal runaway felons,\r\npickpockets and murderers from the United States?'--(the loyal tears\r\nflowing.) Yes, Sir, you coaxed, you threatened, you argued, you wept,\r\nuntil you prevailed upon a corrupt and cringing House, as I have before\r\nremarked, to turn Mr. Bidwell out of his seat, unconstitutionally,\r\nillegally and unjustly; and the next day you were obliged to get one of\r\nyour tools to bring in a Bill to cover this illegal proceeding, and\r\nprevent his re-election, thus forever depriving the country of the\r\nvaluable services of a man better qualified for a legislator, in point\r\nof learning, talent and experience than yourself, or any other man,\r\nperhaps, in Upper Canada. Now, Sir, if you viewed it as a disgrace to\r\nsit in the same House with the father, although in every respect your\r\nsuperior, how will it suit you to bend your outrageously loyal neck to\r\nhis son in the Speaker's chair, who, it is my opinion, is the most fit\r\nperson in the new House to fill it, and who, I doubt not, will be\r\nelected?\"\r\n\r\nThe letter from which the foregoing extract is taken bears date December\r\n25th, and appears in the _Freeman_ of that date. The prediction in the\r\nconcluding sentence was verified. Mr. M. S. Bidwell was elected Speaker\r\nat the opening of the session in January, 1829.\r\n\r\n[62] See 4 Geo. IV., sess. 2, chapter 3, passed 19th January, 1824.\r\n\r\n[63] _Canadian Portrait Gallery_, Vol. I., pp. 17, 46.\r\n\r\n[64] It is to the exertions of Robert Baldwin himself that we owe the\r\nabolition of the doctrine of primogeniture as applied to real estate in\r\nUpper Canada. He it was who, while Attorney-General for the Western\r\nProvince, introduced and carried through the measure of 1851.\r\n\r\n[65] Quoted by Mr. Lindsey, in his _Life and Times of William Lyon\r\nMackenzie_, Vol. I., pp. 40, 41.\r\n\r\n[66] Among those who approved of such a provision no one was more\r\noutspoken than was Mr. Mackenzie himself. In the very first number of\r\nthe _Advocate_ he clearly laid down his platform on this question. \"In\r\nno part of the constitution of the Canadas,\" he writes, \"is the wisdom\r\nof the British Legislature more apparent than in its setting apart a\r\nportion of the country, while yet it remained it wilderness, for the\r\nsupport of religion.\" He expressed himself in favour of a law whereby\r\nthe ministers of every body of professing Christians, being British\r\nsubjects, should receive equal benefits from the Reserves. On this, as\r\non many other subjects, however, the editor of the _Advocate_\r\nsubsequently saw fit to alter his opinions. The instability of his\r\nopinions, indeed, was one of his most dangerous characteristics, and\r\nthis alone marked him out as unfit to be trusted with the guidance of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n[67] _Ante_, p. 110.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA \"FREE AND UNFETTERED\" PRESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Mackenzie's newspaper devoted much space to the advocacy of\r\nResponsible Government, which for many years constituted the main plank\r\nin the Liberal platform. He pointed out the injustice and absurdity of\r\nthe existing state of things, where the people were beguiled with a\r\nmockery of representation in Parliament without having any voice in the\r\nnomination of the persons composing the Government of the day. There was\r\nno attempt on the part of the official body to distort the real facts of\r\nthe case. They straightforwardly avowed their independence of public\r\nopinion, and sneered at arguments founded on the doctrine of ministerial\r\nresponsibility. They proclaimed their immunity from all outdoor\r\ninfluence whatever, and smiled pleasantly when taunted across the floor\r\nof the Assembly with repeated violations of the constitution. Rolph,\r\nBidwell, and other Reform members in the House were sufficiently masters\r\nof themselves to argue this and other questions on purely public\r\ngrounds, and without gross violations of the laws of Parliamentary\r\ndiscipline. This, however, Mr. Mackenzie's impetuous temperament\r\nprevented him from doing, and as he was not in the House he felt at\r\nliberty to give full rein to his impetuosity. He made every important\r\nquestion a personal matter between himself and each individual supporter\r\nof the Government who contradicted him. Through the columns of his paper\r\nhe poured out much bitter invective. What he said was for the most part\r\nundeniably true, but he had such an offensive way of expressing himself\r\nthat the amenities of journalism were constantly violated. By this means\r\nhe brought down upon his head the rancorous hatred of those whom he made\r\nthe objects of attack.\r\n\r\nThe feelings entertained towards him by the members of the Government,\r\nand by the Tory party generally, were largely personal and independent\r\nof politics. The conflict between them may be said to have begun before\r\nthe removal from Queenston to York, and indeed almost before the ink was\r\ndry upon the first number of the _Advocate_. In that number Sir\r\nPeregrine Maitland, the Lieutenant-Governor, was accused of indolence,\r\nand of being the cause why Upper Canada was less progressive than her\r\nenterprising republican neighbour. He was referred to as one who, after\r\nspending his earlier days in the din of war and the turmoil of camps,\r\nhad gained enough renown in Europe to enable him to enjoy himself, like\r\nthe country he governed, in inactivity; whose migrations were, by water,\r\nfrom York to Queenston and from Queenston to York, like the Vicar of\r\nWakefield, from the brown bed to the blue, and from the blue bed to the\r\nbrown. Such comparisons as these could not be expected to find much\r\nfavour with Sir Peregrine, more especially as they notoriously contained\r\nmore than a _soupcon_ of truth. The faction naturally sympathized with\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, and only waited a suitable opportunity to give\r\nadequate expression to their abhorrence of Mackenzie and his doctrines.\r\nAs for Sir Peregrine, he was ready enough to cooeperate with his\r\nsupporters in any proceeding for the suppression of this free-spoken and\r\nmost objectionable little Radical, who dared to wag his plebeian tongue\r\nagainst the son-in-law of a Duke. An occasion for the first overt act of\r\nhostility was afforded by certain rites connected with the erection of\r\nthe monument on Queenston Heights to the memory of Major-General Sir\r\nIsaac Brock. The construction of the monument having been determined\r\nupon, and considerable sums of money having been granted by Parliament\r\nfor the purpose, commissioners were appointed to superintend the work,\r\nwhich was duly proceeded with. The second funeral of the dead hero, and\r\nthe removal of his remains from Fort George, had been fixed for the 18th\r\nof October (1824), being the twelfth anniversary of the battle; but in\r\nthe interim some of the local magnates of the Niagara District resolved\r\nthat the foundation-stone should be laid with masonic honours. The 1st\r\nof June was appointed for this ceremonial, and on that date a\r\nconsiderable number of persons assembled on the Heights to witness it.\r\nMr. Mackenzie, who, it will be remembered, then resided at Queenston,\r\nseems to have taken an active part in the proceedings, and this with the\r\nfull consent and approval of the committee of management. A glass\r\nvessel, hermetically sealed, and enclosing a number of coins and a copy\r\nof _The Upper Canada Gazette_, together with the recently-issued first\r\nnumber of _The Colonial Advocate_, was produced for the purpose of being\r\nplaced within the hollow of the foundation-stone. The vessel and its\r\ncontents, enveloped in an otter's skin, were placed by Mr. Mackenzie in\r\nthe cavity, the spectators looking on in quiet approval. The stone was\r\nthen touched with the trowel, the deposit was covered up, and the rite\r\nwas complete. An account of the proceedings found its way into the\r\nnewspapers, and Sir Peregrine Maitland learned, to his intense disgust,\r\nof the part which Mackenzie had been permitted to take in the ceremony.\r\nHe sent for Colonel Thomas Clark, one of the commissioners appointed by\r\nParliament to superintend the construction of the column, and, in a\r\nvoice of undisguised passion, gave orders to that gentleman that the\r\nglass vessel should forthwith be disinterred, and the copy of the\r\n_Advocate_ removed therefrom. The mandate was of course obeyed. As the\r\ncolumn had by this time reached a considerable height, the excavation\r\nwas no slight task. Mr. Mackenzie himself, who personally attended at\r\nwhat he called the \"premature resurrection,\" claimed and obtained\r\npossession of the number of the paper which had caused so much\r\nunnecessary labour and ill-temper.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward there was almost incessant warfare between Mr.\r\nMackenzie and the official party: warfare sometimes suppressed,\r\nsometimes altogether concealed for a brief season, but always ready to\r\nbreak out upon the slightest pretext--sometimes, indeed, without any\r\napparent pretext at all.\r\n\r\nSoon after the _Advocate's_ removal to York, and not long before the\r\nopening of the Legislature, the Honourable D'Arcy Boulton, one of the\r\npuisne judges, laid himself open to attack by conduct of the most\r\nreprehensible kind. In a case tried before him, in which his son, the\r\nSolicitor-General, appeared on behalf of the Crown, the Judge displayed\r\nsuch gross partiality that one cannot read the report of the\r\nproceedings, even as chronicled by one of the organs of the Government,\r\nwithout mingled feelings of wonder and disgust. At the present day such\r\nconduct on the part of an occupant of the judicial bench would bring\r\ndown upon his head the animadversions of the press of the whole country.\r\nSixty years ago it passed without editorial remark from any of the\r\njournals of the time, with the single exception of the _Advocate_, which\r\ncertainly used some very plain words in characterizing the Judge's\r\nbehaviour. It appealed to the Legislature to address the Governor on the\r\nsubject, with a request to dismiss from office the whole of the Boulton\r\nrace, root and branch. \"If a Government emanating from England,\" wrote\r\nMr. Mackenzie, \"can cherish such a corrupt, such a Star Chamber crew,\r\nthen the days of the infamous Scroggs and Jeffries are returned upon us;\r\nand we may lament for ourselves, for our wives and for our children,\r\nthat the British Constitution is, in Canada, a phantom to delude to\r\ndestruction, instead of being the day-star of our dearest liberties.\"\r\n\r\nSuch language as this, which was a mild specimen of the writer's\r\ntrenchant style, was not, upon the whole, too strong for the occasion.\r\nIn other instances he was roused to greater fury on less provocation,\r\nand used phrases unbefitting the columns of any paper which aspires to\r\nbe a public instructor. But he was not alone in his scurrility. Some of\r\nthe persons attacked in the _Advocate_ retorted upon the editor through\r\nthe official press in language far less defensible than his own. He was\r\ndenounced as an upstart and a demagogue, whose low origin placed him far\r\nbeneath the notice of gentlemen. This language, be it understood, was\r\nused by at least one wealthy and influential personage whose own origin\r\nwas such that Mr. Mackenzie's might have been pronounced aristocratic by\r\ncomparison. To all such vapourings Mr. Mackenzie responded in the\r\n_Advocate_ in kind. He had a large vocabulary of Billingsgate at his\r\ncommand, and as his temper became thoroughly aroused he proved that he\r\ncould fully hold his own in this sort of wordy warfare. He followed the\r\nexample of his antagonists, invaded the sanctities of private life, and\r\ndescended to outrageous personalities. The persons thus placed in the\r\njournalistic pillory were merely paid back in their own coin, but they\r\nhad never been accustomed to yield to others the privileges they claimed\r\nfor themselves, and could not understand how \"this fellow\" dared presume\r\nto retort the foulness hurled at him. His paper meanwhile enjoyed a\r\nfair circulation, and his enemies periodically saw themselves held up\r\nbefore the people of the Province in a light well calculated to bring\r\ndown public execration upon them. They winced, and hated their aggressor\r\nwith a hatred which knew no bounds.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the first session of the Ninth Parliament, in 1825,\r\nthe struggle between the two political parties had assumed a distinct\r\nform. The Opposition contended for a responsible Executive; the\r\nGovernment repudiated the contention with sarcastic contempt. There were\r\nvarious other grounds of dispute, but this great question overshadowed\r\nand practically included all. It cannot truly be said that there was\r\nmuch perceptible progress in reform during the session; indeed material\r\nprogress was impossible so long as the Government controlled the\r\nLegislative Council, and while the Executive Councillors held on to\r\noffice in spite of the hostile votes of the Assembly. The way towards\r\nreform was however paved by the debates. Never before had the Government\r\nof Upper Canada been subjected to the incessant criticism of a watchful\r\nand vigorous phalanx of censors within the walls of Parliament. They\r\nwere not wise enough to read the signs of the times, and would yield\r\nnothing to the demands of their opponents. They still believed in the\r\nefficacy of repression, and the next few years were marked by a series\r\nof high-handed persecutions which did more to speed the progress of\r\nreform than all the eloquence of Rolph and Bidwell could have effected\r\nin half a century.\r\n\r\nAs for Mackenzie, he would doubtless have been dealt with as Gourlay had\r\nbeen, could such a course have been adopted towards him with safety.\r\nIsaac Swayzes in abundance might no doubt have been found to swear that\r\nthe obnoxious personage had not been a resident of the Province for the\r\npreceding six months. Doubtless, also, phrases had been used in the\r\n_Advocate_ which, isolated from the context, might have been tortured\r\ninto something like sedition. But the party in power were not so dull as\r\nto be unable to perceive that _that_ experiment must not be repeated.\r\nThe Liberal schoolmaster had been actively at work within the last few\r\nyears, and any attempt to re-enact that glaring iniquity would, to say\r\nthe least, be attended with serious risk to the actors. The most\r\nfeasible method of disposing of the noisy little firebrand presented\r\nitself in the shape of successive indictments for libel, to which his\r\naggressive and unguarded mode of writing would be certain to expose him.\r\nIt is of course impossible to obtain direct evidence of an express\r\nconspiracy on the part of the Government to destroy him by such means. A\r\nconspiracy of that nature would not be likely to take the shape of a\r\nwritten contract which might be produced against the contracting parties\r\nin the future. Nor would the parties to such a conspiracy be likely to\r\nleave any written traces of it behind them. Still, anyone who has the\r\nopportunity and inclination to go minutely into the question will be\r\nirresistibly driven to the conclusion that there was some sort of\r\nunderstanding among the chiefs of the official party that the\r\npublication of the _Advocate_ was to be stopped, and that its editor was\r\nto be either driven out of the country or reduced to silence.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Mackenzie himself had serious difficulties to\r\ncontend with. The _Advocate_, notwithstanding its considerable\r\ncirculation, did not yield any appreciable income. Subscribers were\r\nbackward in their payments, and the cost of making collections reduced\r\nthe profit to little or nothing. The postage to country subscribers had\r\nto be paid in advance by the publisher, which was in itself a\r\nconsiderable drain upon his resources. The issue of the paper was\r\nmoreover necessarily attended by a good deal of expense. It did not\r\nappear regularly, and the intervals between successive numbers were\r\nsometimes of considerable duration. This irregularity was a serious\r\ndrawback to its prosperity, and a source of much dissatisfaction to its\r\npatrons. Such a combination of discouragements could have but one\r\nresult. By the beginning of June, 1826, Mr. Mackenzie had been reduced\r\nto serious pecuniary embarrassment, and had temporarily withdrawn\r\nhimself from the jurisdiction, pending an arrangement with his\r\ncreditors. It is in the highest degree improbable that another number of\r\nthe paper would ever have been issued. It was moribund, if not already\r\ndead. But when matters had arrived at this pass, the violence of\r\nMackenzie's enemies led them to commit an act of lawless ruffianism\r\nwhich gave the _Advocate_ a new lease of life. The act moreover aroused\r\nmuch popular indignation against the perpetrators, and a proportionate\r\ndegree of sympathy for their victim, to whom it gave additional\r\nimportance, while it at the same time materially improved his financial\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of the year 1826 the _Advocate's_ criticisms upon\r\ncertain members of the oligarchical faction were marked by exceptional\r\nacerbity. The persons attacked, however, sought in vain throughout the\r\nclosely-packed columns for any material upon which a criminal\r\nprosecution might be founded; for Mr. Mackenzie, whether by prudence or\r\ngood fortune, contrived for some weeks to say very acrid things without\r\nrendering himself liable to an indictment. Among the persons who were\r\ncompelled to pass through the fire of his criticism was the Honourable\r\nJames Buchanan Macaulay, a gentleman who in after years attained the\r\nhonour of knighthood, and became Chief Justice of the Court of Common\r\nPleas for Upper Canada. At the period under consideration he was a\r\nmember of the Executive Council, and occupied a high position at the\r\nlocal bar. The language employed by the _Advocate_ with respect to him\r\nwas comparatively mild, and did not even mention him by name. Moreover,\r\nthe editor's remarks appear to have been entirely in accordance with\r\nfacts. At any rate they were altogether insufficient to account for the\r\nstate of ferocity into which Mr. Macaulay allowed himself to be lashed.\r\nHe prepared and published a pamphlet, in which he gave vent to such\r\nscurrility as it seems incredible that any man of education, or even of\r\ndecent social training, could ever have descended to write. Truly, no\r\nman is ever so effectually written down as when he himself holds the\r\npen. Those readers who wish to be better acquainted with the depths to\r\nwhich an angry man can lower himself, and who have not access to Mr.\r\nMacaulay's pamphlet, can obtain some inkling of the truth by reference\r\nto Mr. Lindsey's \"Life and Times of William Lyon Mackenzie.\"[68] As Mr.\r\nLindsey very justly remarks:--\"The cause of the quarrel was utterly\r\ncontemptible, and Mr. Macaulay showed to great disadvantage in it.\" It\r\nseems probable enough that one main object of the publication of the\r\npamphlet was to goad Mr. Mackenzie into a retort which would render him\r\namenable to the law of libel. In one sense this plan--if such there\r\nwere--succeeded. The _Advocate_ came out with a long reply which\r\ncontained an abundance of scandalous matter, a great part of which, as\r\nthe writer must have been well aware, had no shadow of foundation in\r\ntruth. The matter related not only to persons occupying public\r\nsituations, but to individuals altogether unconnected with public life,\r\nincluding respectable married women and persons who had long been dead.\r\nBut most of the statements and insinuations, even those which were\r\nunsupported by a tittle of evidence--nay, even those which were\r\nnotoriously groundless--related to and were interwoven with\r\ncircumstances which, as the persons involved well knew, would not bear\r\ndiscussion. It would never do to permit such matters to become the\r\nsubject of judicial investigation. Anything in the shape of an enquiry\r\nwould inevitably lead to disclosures seriously affecting the honour of\r\nmore than one member of the Compact. An indictment, therefore, was out\r\nof the question.\r\n\r\nIt has often been asserted that the oligarchy are to be held accountable\r\nfor the display of ruffianly violence which followed Mackenzie's retort\r\nto Macaulay's pamphlet. In one sense this is true, for it was in\r\nconsequence of their long abuse of the supremacy which they enjoyed that\r\nfeelings of hatred and enmity were begotten between one stratum of\r\nsociety and another; and it was this hatred which gave rise to violent\r\nmeasures. But if it is meant to be implied that the oligarchy, as a\r\nbody, conceived the design, or that it was carried out under their\r\nauspices, the implication is too absurd to stand in need of serious\r\nrebuttal. To carry the argument no farther, the body was too numerous to\r\nadmit of any general secret cooeperation between them for such a purpose.\r\nAs simple matter of fact, all knowledge of the contemplated violence was\r\nconfined to the breasts of those who took part in it. No one familiar\r\nwith the circumstances, however, can doubt that it met with the fullest\r\napproval of the ruling faction after it had been effected, and that, so\r\nfar as such a thing was possible, the wrong-doers were protected by them\r\nfrom the consequences of the outrage. To this charge they must perforce\r\nplead guilty; but there are degrees in guilt, and the endorsation, or\r\neven the approval of an act after it has been committed, is a different\r\nthing from the original conception and carrying out of it. The\r\nrespective weight of culpability, in the case under consideration, is a\r\nmatter which the reader may very well be left to estimate according to\r\nhis own judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the outrage itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1826.]\r\n\r\nThe office of the _Advocate_ was situated on the north-west corner of\r\nFrederick and Front[69] streets, in a building which had been the\r\nbirthplace of Robert Baldwin, and in which the Cawthras subsequently\r\ncarried on a large and very successful mercantile business.[70] Readers\r\nacquainted with the neighbourhood will not need to be informed that this\r\nsite is in close proximity to the bay. Mr. Mackenzie, with his aged\r\nmother--who had long before followed him to Canada--and the rest of his\r\nfamily, resided in the building, which was therefore his home, as well\r\nas his place of business. At about half-past six o'clock in the\r\nafternoon of Thursday, the 8th of June, 1826, in broad daylight, and\r\nwhile the proprietor was absent in the United States,[71] a raid was\r\nmade upon the printing establishment, which, in the course of a few\r\nminutes, was reduced to a state of confusion and chaos. The door was\r\nbroken open, the press partly demolished, the imposing-stone overturned,\r\nand a quantity of type battered and thrown into the adjacent bay. The\r\ncontents of some of the cases were \"pied\" and scattered around the\r\nfloor. Frames, chases, galleys, composing-sticks and office furniture\r\nwere thrown together in one confused heap. In a word, the entire office\r\nwas turned topsy-turvy. Mr. Mackenzie's mother, who was then in her\r\nseventy-eighth year, stood and watched the proceedings in a state of\r\ngreat fear and agitation from a corner of the office.[72]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature about the whole of this extraordinary\r\ntransaction was that there appeared to be no attempt at concealment. It\r\nwas carried out as though it had been the most legitimate and ordinary\r\nbusiness enterprise, to which no one could reasonably offer any sort of\r\nobjection. The raiders did not think it necessary to wait for darkness,\r\nnor did they resort to any disguises. If they did not court publicity,\r\nthey at least took no care to avoid it. They chose a time of day when\r\nthe journeymen and apprentices connected with the establishment were\r\nalmost certain to be absent, and when there would be no one to oppose\r\ntheir entrance; though, according to the printed admission of the prime\r\nmover and instigator of the affair, they were prepared, if necessary, to\r\noppose force to force in order to effect their purpose. As there was\r\nnobody in the office, any such display of force was happily uncalled\r\nfor. Having made their way inside, the work of destruction was proceeded\r\nwith coolly and calmly, as though there was no necessity for\r\nextraordinary haste. When they had fully worked their will, they\r\ndeparted as quietly as they had arrived.\r\n\r\nThe actual perpetrators of this unique act of ruffianism were nine in\r\nnumber. They were none of them ruffians by profession, and were not\r\ncommonly rated as blackguards. They could not even plead the poor excuse\r\nthat they were under the influence of strong drink. Most of them were\r\nyoung men, and nearly all of them were closely identified, either by\r\ninterest or by close relationship, with prominent members of the\r\noligarchy. They were, in short, with few exceptions, the flower of the\r\naristocracy of the little capital. Chief among them was Samuel Peters\r\nJarvis, barrister, the slayer of poor young John Ridout, mentioned on a\r\nformer page.[73] He, at least, could not plead in extenuation of his\r\nshare in the transaction that he had been carried away by the\r\nuncontrollable effervescence of youth, for he was at this time not far\r\nshort of thirty-four years of age[74]. His acquittal on a more serious\r\ncharge nearly nine years before might well have led him to believe that\r\nhe could with impunity set the law at defiance. His identification with\r\nthe ruling faction is easily traced, for he was a son of Mr. William\r\nJarvis, who was for many years Secretary of the Province; and he was\r\nmoreover son-in-law to ex-Chief Justice Powell.[75] He himself held a\r\nsituation under Government at this time--being Clerk of the Crown in\r\nChancery--and stood high in the favour of Sir Peregrine Maitland,\r\ntowards whom he sometimes acted in the capacity of private secretary. He\r\nwas the chief offender, for it was by him that the outrage was planned,\r\nand he was the directing spirit throughout, as well as the most noisy\r\nand impudent apologist for it afterwards. Another active participant in\r\nthe raid was Captain John Lyons, a confidential clerk in the\r\nLieutenant-Governor's office. A third was Henry Sherwood, student at law\r\nin the office of Attorney-General Robinson, and Clerk of Assize. He was\r\na son of the Honourable Levius Petere Sherwood, one of the puisne\r\njudges, and was also connected with other leading members of the ruling\r\nfaction. It is due to him to say that he eventually outgrew the follies\r\nof his youth, and became an able lawyer, a prominent politician, and a\r\nuseful member of society. He alone, of all the participators in this\r\nshameful business, attained to anything like honourable distinction. A\r\nfourth member of the gang of kid-gloved housebreakers was Charles\r\nHeward, a son of Colonel Stephen Heward, who, in addition to being an\r\nactive spirit among the Compact, was a magistrate, Clerk of the Peace in\r\nand for the Home District, and Auditor-General of Land Patents. The\r\nothers were Charles Richardson, a student in the office of\r\nAttorney-General Robinson; James King, a student in Solicitor-General\r\nBoulton's office; Peter McDougall, a well-known shopkeeper in York in\r\nthose times; and two sons of the Honourable James Baby,\r\nInspector-General, and member of the Executive Council. These were all\r\nthe active participants in the outrage. While it was in progress a\r\nnumber of other persons appeared upon the scene, but did not take any\r\npart therein otherwise than as spectators.\r\n\r\nIt is of course not to be supposed that this incursion was attributable,\r\neither directly or indirectly, to the Government as a body, or that it\r\nhad formed a subject of deliberation at the Council Board. The charge\r\nthat it was attributable to the entire oligarchy has already been\r\ndisposed of.[76] But it is at least fairly to be inferred that, after\r\nthe thing had been done, the Government considered themselves as being\r\nunder obligations to the misguided persons concerned in it. Several of\r\nthe latter received appointments to positions of public trust and\r\nemolument, such as are usually conferred by Governments upon deserving\r\nsupporters. Jarvis was successively appointed to various posts, the most\r\nimportant of which was that of Indian Commissioner, in which capacity he\r\nbecame a defaulter to the Government, and was involved in serious\r\npecuniary and other difficulties. The avenging ghost of John Ridout\r\npursued him, and his subsequent career was not one to be contemplated\r\nwith admiration. Richardson, again, was appointed Clerk of the Peace for\r\nthe Niagara District. Sir Peregrine Maitland could not pretend to\r\noverlook the dereliction of his confidential clerk, Captain Lyons, who\r\nwas accordingly dismissed from that position. But this was not the end\r\nof the story. Many readers are doubtless familiar with Halifax's remark\r\nwhen Lawrence Hyde, Earl of Rochester, was removed from the post of\r\nFirst Lord of the Treasury and installed in that of Lord President. \"I\r\nhave seen people kicked downstairs,\" remarked the great Trimmer, \"but my\r\nLord Rochester is the first person that I ever saw kicked\r\nup-stairs.\"[77] In like manner the Lieutenant-Governor's clerk was soon\r\nafterwards kicked up-stairs, by being appointed Registrar of the Niagara\r\nDistrict.\r\n\r\nIt really seemed as though this wanton and most reprehensible invasion\r\nof private rights was regarded by those in authority as a high and\r\nmeritorious action. It was certainly so regarded by \"the best society\"\r\nof York at the time. The young men, who ought to have been made to\r\nsuffer social ostracism, were petted and caressed as heroes who had done\r\nsome grand service to the State; and, as will presently be seen, they\r\nwere not even permitted to suffer any considerable pecuniary loss by\r\nreason of their breach of the law. Finding that their conduct led to\r\ntheir being made the subjects of a sort of hero-worship, it is not\r\nsurprising that they soon came to pique themselves upon what they had\r\ndone, and, so far from feeling any consciousness of shame or regret, to\r\nopenly court publicity for their proceedings. Jarvis was especially\r\nculpable in this respect, and was not ashamed to write letters to the\r\npapers on the subject, in one of which he avowed himself as the author\r\nand originator of the outrage. He admitted having led on his band of\r\nsemi-official desperadoes, determined to \"persevere, if resistance had\r\nbeen made.\" As to the morality or immorality of the act, he professed\r\nhimself \"easy on that head.\" Such language as this, coming, as it did,\r\nfrom one who had shed the blood of a fellow-creature upon very slight\r\nprovocation; who had been tried for murder, and acquitted because the\r\ncrime was sanctioned by the usages of society; and who, moreover, in the\r\nestimation of many people, richly deserved the hangman's noose--such\r\nlanguage, under the circumstances, was not merely injudicious and\r\nunfeeling, but positively revolting. The only conceivable excuse that\r\ncan be made for it arises from the fact that Jarvis was at the time\r\nirritated by a succession of attacks in the newspapers, in which his\r\nconduct, bad as it had been, was held up in even a more odious light\r\nthan it deserved. The excuse may be taken for what it is worth. It is at\r\nleast certain that had the transgressor been imbued with feelings of\r\nordinary delicacy he would not have permitted himself to be goaded into\r\nusing such expressions as are to be found in his \"Statement of Facts,\"\r\npublished at York nearly two years after the type riot.[78] His\r\ncallousness stirred the hot blood of Francis Collins, of _The Canadian\r\nFreeman_, to speak his mind editorially on the subject:--\"We view it,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"as the greatest misfortune that could happen to any man in\r\nthis life to imbrue his hands in the blood of a fellow-man. But as this\r\nbarbarous practice has, by long usage, become familiar to the mind of\r\ncivilized society, we think it is a misfortune that might occur to an\r\notherwise virtuous and well-disposed man, and therefore ought not\r\n(unless under aggravated circumstances) to be a reproach either to\r\nhimself or to his children; provided that, during the remainder of his\r\nlife he will show that caution which becomes his delicate situation, and\r\nprove by his subsequent benevolence that he regrets his misfortune. But\r\nif, after once having stained his hands with human blood, he will act\r\nthe desperado, and become a leader in such outrages as may end in a\r\nrepetition of his former act--then, we say, he is worthy of reproach,\r\nand ought to be viewed as the common enemy of mankind.\"[79]\r\n\r\nNews of the aggression soon found its way to Mr. Mackenzie at\r\nLewiston.[80] He at once returned to York, and lost no time in\r\ninstituting proceedings against eight of the aggressors who had\r\nconstituted themselves a vigilance committee at his expense. He brought\r\na civil action for damages, and erelong these incipient \"Regulators of\r\nUpper Canada\" began to realize that they had acted with some\r\nprecipitation and foolhardiness. It seemed probable that they would be\r\nmulcted in heavy damages; and even these would be no bar to a criminal\r\nprosecution. The aforementioned James Buchanan Macaulay was appointed to\r\nconduct their defence. The plaintiff's attorney was James Edward Small,\r\na rising young lawyer who afterwards made some figure in political life,\r\nand who belonged to a well-known family in York. Overtures in the\r\ndirection of a compromise were made on behalf of the raiders, who\r\noffered first two hundred pounds and afterwards three hundred by way of\r\nfull compensation. The smaller amount would have been an abundant\r\nrecompense for the actual loss,[81] but Mackenzie felt that public\r\nsympathy was with him, and he was desirous that the facts should go to a\r\njury. The offer of the defendants was rejected, and the case came on for\r\ntrial before Chief Justice Campbell and a special jury in the following\r\nOctober. Associated with the Chief Justice were the Honourable William\r\nAllan and Mr. Alexander McDonnell, as Justices of the Peace. The\r\nplaintiff's counsel were Marshall Spring Bidwell, J. E. Small, and\r\nAlexander Stewart, of Niagara. The defendants were represented by J. B.\r\nMacaulay and Christopher Alexander Hagerman. These names afford\r\nsufficient evidence that full justice was done to the case on both\r\nsides. Hagerman was a counsel of remarkable ability, and he fought very\r\nhard. His argument was a masterpiece of clever, specious reasoning, well\r\ncalculated to produce an effect upon uneducated or half-educated\r\njurymen. He took an enlightened stand, admitting the advantage to a\r\ncommunity of a free and unfettered press. He then proceeded to argue\r\naway all the consequences of the admission, alleging that the career of\r\nthe _Advocate_ had been one of license, and not of mere freedom. But the\r\nevidence of the outrage was clear and unassailable, and the defence did\r\nnot venture to call any witnesses. It was proved on behalf of the\r\nplaintiff that three members of the ruling faction, two of whom were\r\nmagistrates, had been in close proximity to the scene of the raid at the\r\ntime when it took place; and there appears to be very little doubt that\r\nall three must have been eye-witnesses of the outrage. One of these was\r\nthe Honourable William Allan, who, at the very moment when this evidence\r\nwas given, sat on the bench to the right of the Chief Justice as an\r\nassociate judge on the trial. Colonel Heward, whose son Charles was one\r\nof the delinquents, was the other magistrate compromised by the\r\nevidence. The third person alleged to have witnessed the transaction was\r\nMr. Macaulay, leading counsel for the defence. The utter incongruity and\r\nunseemliness of the whole affair from first to last seems\r\nincomprehensible at the present day. All sense of the fitness of things\r\nseems to have been wanting.\r\n\r\nThe trespass had been flagrant and bold, and the only question which the\r\njury had to consider was the amount of damages. There were conflicting\r\nelements among the jurors, who were long in coming to a decision. After\r\nmuch deliberation they returned a verdict of L625, which sum, together\r\nwith costs of suit, was soon afterwards paid over to the plaintiff's\r\nattorney.[82] But the rioters themselves were not suffered to sustain\r\nthis loss. Prominent adherents of the official party did not hesitate to\r\nsay that by the attack upon Mr. Mackenzie's press and type, and by the\r\nconsequent stoppage of publication of his paper,[83] the perpetrators of\r\nthe outrage had rendered an essential service to society, by abating an\r\nintolerable nuisance. Under such circumstances it was only just that\r\nsociety should bear harmless those who had thrown themselves into the\r\nbreach and vindicated her rights. It was resolved that a subscription\r\nshould be set on foot with this laudable object.\r\n\r\nAmong the few high Tories resident at York in those days upon whose\r\ncharacters it is possible for one of modern ideas to look with sympathy,\r\nand even with a considerable degree of admiration, was Colonel James\r\nFitz Gibbon. The Colonel was a gallant veteran who had fought the\r\nbattles of his country on two continents, at Copenhagen and the Helder,\r\nat Fort Erie and the Beaver Dams. His military career was not yet quite\r\nat an end, for he was destined to play an important part in the\r\nputting-down of the Upper Canadian Rebellion; a circumstance which\r\nfurnishes a sufficient justification for a somewhat more extended\r\nreference to him in this place than his mere connection with the press\r\nriot would have rendered necessary. He was an Irishman of humble origin,\r\nwho had enlisted as a private soldier at the age of seventeen, and who,\r\nby sheer force of energy, bravery and aptitude for his profession, had\r\nfought his way to military rank and honour. After seeing much service on\r\nthe continent, and passing through as many adventures as a knight-errant\r\nof old, he was transferred to British North America. His gallant\r\nservices in this country are imperfectly recorded in various accounts of\r\nthe War of 1812, and in Tupper's \"Life of Brock.\" Every Canadian is, or\r\nought to be, familiar with the circumstances attending the capture by\r\nhim of a force of 450 infantry, fifty cavalry, and two guns, he himself\r\nbeing at the time in command of only forty-eight men. After the close of\r\nthe war he was placed on half pay, and took up his abode at York. He\r\nattached himself to the Provincial militia, whence he derived his rank\r\nof Colonel. He likewise obtained a post in the Adjutant-General's\r\noffice, and subsequently became Deputy Adjutant-General, which position\r\nhe held at the period at which the narrative has arrived. He was also in\r\nthe Commission of the Peace, and frequently sat in Quarter Sessions.\r\nHis share in suppressing the revolt in 1837 will be narrated in its\r\nproper place. For the rest it may be added that he was always\r\nimpecunious, for, apart from the fact that he was no financier, and\r\nnever knew how to take care of money when he had any, the expenses of\r\nhis outfit when promoted to the rank of Adjutant, in 1806, formed the\r\nnucleus of a debt which hampered him from youth to old age. His\r\nindigence often subjected him to straits which must have been hard to\r\nbear; but he was of a sanguine, joyous disposition, and poverty, though\r\nit might temporarily overcloud his happiness, had no power to break his\r\nindomitable spirit. During his long residence in Canada he was a\r\npersistent seeker after office, because he was almost always in\r\npecuniary straits; but he fully earned all the emoluments he ever\r\nreceived from the Government, and if his income had been five times as\r\nlarge as it ever was he would probably have been neither more\r\ncomfortable nor less impecunious. It seemed as though no experience\r\ncould lead him to take thought for the morrow. His chief characteristics\r\nwere such as are not uncommon among his fellow-countrymen. He was\r\ngenerous and open-hearted to a fault, ever ready to bestow his last\r\nshilling upon anybody who needed it, or who even made a plausible\r\npretence of needing it. He was rash, impetuous and indiscreet, but the\r\nranks of the British army held no braver or more loyal heart than his.\r\nIn his simple and gentle soul there was no room for envy or guile. He\r\nseems, indeed, to have been in many respects a sort of Irish reflection\r\nof Colonel Newcome; and the parallel even extended to the outward\r\ncircumstances attending the close of their respective lives. Colonel\r\nNewcome, when all his worldly possessions had gone from him, retired to\r\nGrey Friars--the Charterhouse--a retreat for \"poor and decayed\r\nbrethren,\" when the world seemed to afford no other asylum. There he\r\npassed the remainder of his days, and there he said \"Adsum\" when his\r\nname was called for the last time in this world. In like manner Colonel\r\nFitz Gibbon, when all other resources failed him, was able, through the\r\nkindness of Lord Seaton, to obtain a place in an asylum of somewhat\r\nsimilar character. At Royal Windsor there is an institution which\r\nprovides a retreat from the cares and storms of life for a limited\r\nnumber of depleted old military officers. The members are styled\r\nMilitary Knights of Windsor, and the abodes provided for them are\r\nsituated \"within the precincts.\" Hither, in 1850, when he had entered\r\nupon his seventieth year, the battered old hero of many fights retired\r\nto pass in quiet the evening of an active life. He survived for more\r\nthan ten years, during which period he succeeded in obtaining for\r\nhimself and his brother knights certain important privileges of which\r\nthey had theretofore been deprived.\r\n\r\nThough he was not, in the proper sense of the word, a politician, both\r\nhis interests and his superabundant loyalty impelled him to the side of\r\nthose in power. No one in the Province had less respect for radicals of\r\nthe Mackenzie stamp. It was sufficient for him to reflect that the\r\nofficial party reflected the might and majesty of the Crown of Great\r\nBritain. His whole nature, fostered by his military training, revolted\r\nat the idea of opposition to those in authority. He was moreover\r\ndependent upon the Government for his place in the Adjutant-General's\r\noffice, and would naturally espouse the side of his patrons. The Compact\r\nhad no more faithful adherent, and by no one were \"low radicals\" held in\r\nmore profound abhorrence. He was roused to a high pitch of fervour by\r\nthe trial of the press rioters, who, in his opinion, had acted in the\r\nmost patriotic and praiseworthy spirit. When the verdict had been\r\nrendered, and when it had become manifest that the defendants must pay\r\nthe penalty of their acts, the Colonel regarded them as martyrs. He\r\npromptly volunteered to canvass the town for subscriptions to a fund for\r\ndischarging the liability, and thus saving \"the boys,\" as he called\r\nthem, from loss. He was as good as his word, and the requisite sum was\r\nsoon forthcoming. Who the contributors to this fund were has never been\r\nfully revealed, and the secret is likely to be well kept, for the list\r\nwas burned by Colonel Fitz Gibbon immediately after it had served its\r\npurpose, and there is probably no man now living who can throw any light\r\nupon the subject. Mr. Lindsey observes[84] that \"it is believed the\r\nofficials of the day were not backward in assisting to indemnify the\r\ndefendants in the type-riot trial, for the adverse verdict of an\r\nimpartial jury\"--a belief which, under the circumstances, is certainly\r\nnot an extravagant one. It was commonly rumoured that several heads of\r\ndepartments had contributed twenty pounds each to the fund, and Francis\r\nCollins gave currency to the rumour through the columns of his paper.\r\nThe controversy to which this gave rise was the indirect means of\r\nfurnishing almost the only evidence now obtainable as to the signatures\r\nto the subscription list. Collins asserted that Sir Peregrine Maitland's\r\nown name was understood to be at the head of the list, opposite to a\r\nlarge contribution. Colonel Fitz Gibbon was so indiscreet as to write a\r\nreply, in which he distinctly declared that the latter's assertion was\r\nwholly untrue, _so far as the Lieutenant-Governor was concerned_. From\r\nthis letter, which was duly given to the public in the _Freeman_, it was\r\nnot unfairly to be inferred that the assertion, so far as it related to\r\nthe heads of departments, could not be truthfully denied. That some, at\r\nleast, of the members of the official body contributed to the fund was\r\nmatter of notoriety in York at the time, and, so far as I am aware, has\r\nnever been denied. The Honourable James Baby, indeed, who was then or\r\nshortly afterwards the senior member of the Executive Council, and who,\r\nas before mentioned, was the father of two of the young men concerned in\r\nthe raid, contributed his share with great reluctance. He was at this\r\ntime advanced in life--he was in his sixty-fifth year--and he had ceased\r\nto carry much weight in the Great Council of the Province, having been\r\nto a large extent superseded by younger and more energetic men. His\r\nopinions were no longer deferred to as they had once been, and on one or\r\ntwo occasions he had, as he conceived, been treated with inadequate\r\nrespect by some of his junior colleagues. He felt his position keenly,\r\nand there is reason for believing that he would have resigned his office\r\nof Inspector-General and his seat at the Council Board, had it not been\r\nthat there were many demands upon his purse, and that he was largely\r\ndependent upon his official salary for the support of his family. On a\r\nsubsequent page a notable instance will be given of the degradation to\r\nwhich his poverty compelled him to submit at the hands of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor. Under the circumstances, however, he could not\r\nrefuse to contribute to Colonel Fitz Gibbon's list; and it is recorded\r\nthat when one of his sons called upon him for the amount which he had\r\nsubscribed, he handed over the sum with justifiable petulance, saying:\r\n\"There, go and make one great fool of yourself again.\"[85] Such of the\r\nrioters as were possessed of means contributed to the fund according to\r\ntheir respective ability, but the others were not allowed to bear more\r\nthan a very small share of the loss.\r\n\r\nThe only other documentary evidence to be had on the subject of the\r\nsubscribers to the fund is to be found in the \"Statement of Facts\" of\r\nSamuel Peters Jarvis himself. \"I have on my part to assure the public,\"\r\nhe writes, \"that so far from being indemnified by the contributions\r\nwhich from various motives were made for our relief, the burthen fell\r\nheavily upon such of us as had the means of paying anything; and I\r\naffirm that the share of the verdict which I myself had to defray, from\r\nno very abundant means, was such that if Mr. Mackenzie had made as much\r\nclear profit by his press during the whole time he has employed it in\r\nthe work of detraction, he would not have found it necessary to leave\r\nthe concern, and abandon it to his creditors.\" To which statement it may\r\nbe added that a gentleman now living in Toronto distinctly remembers\r\nhearing Mr. Jarvis say that his own contribution to the fund was\r\nprecisely L109; that that of Peter McDougall was about the same; and\r\nthat none of the rest of the rioters paid anything, except through their\r\nparents or relatives.\r\n\r\nThe civil liability having been discharged, the public looked forward to\r\na criminal prosecution, for it seemed outrageous that the perpetrators\r\nof such an offence against society should escape without any greater\r\npenalty than had thus far been exacted from them. Mr. Mackenzie himself\r\nseems to have been desirous of proceeding to extremities, although the\r\namount which he had recovered was far more than compensation for any\r\nloss he had sustained, whether direct or incidental. But the brains of\r\nhis professional advisers were cooler than his own, and saved him from\r\nthe consequences of his want of judgment. Mr. Bidwell dissuaded him from\r\ntaking any steps which might seem to be dictated by a feeling of\r\nrevenge. It was represented to him that he was a decided gainer by the\r\nraid, not only in pocket but in popularity. The public sympathy had been\r\nwith him from first to last. A policy of war to the knife on his part\r\nwould certainly cool, and in some cases altogether alienate that\r\nsympathy. The jury's liberal verdict bad placed him \"in funds,\" and he\r\nwas thus in a position to resume the publication of the _Advocate_\r\nunder favourable circumstances. The transaction had distinctly\r\nincreased his prestige in the rural constituencies, and he might\r\nreasonably hope to be a successful candidate for Parliament when a\r\nsuitable vacancy should occur. Such being the position of affairs, he\r\nwas strongly advised to let well alone. Contrary to his habit, he proved\r\namenable to advice, and refrained from a criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe issue fully justified the advice of Mr. Mackenzie's counsellors.\r\nSeveral of the newspapers in the Province commended his forbearance, and\r\ncontrasted his conduct with that of his enemies. But, it was asked, what\r\nwas the Attorney-General about? How was it that he, who never failed to\r\nstretch his authority to the utmost when a Reformer rendered himself\r\namenable to the law--how was it that he permitted such an outrage as\r\nthis to pass without notice? Surely it was his duty to officially\r\nproceed against the wrong-doers. But the Attorney-General was deaf to\r\nall such remonstrances, and did not concern himself with the matter\r\nfurther than to maintain the most cordial relations with the persons\r\nimplicated. How far his conduct in this respect was consistent will\r\nhereafter appear. Colonel Fitz Gibbon was rewarded for his zeal in a bad\r\ncause by receiving the appointment of Clerk to the Legislative Assembly,\r\nand the additional income thus afforded him left him neither better off\r\nnor worse than before.\r\n\r\nThe participators in perhaps the grossest outrage ever committed in the\r\nProvincial capital thus escaped, for the time, all due penalty for their\r\nmisconduct. It may almost be said, indeed, that they escaped altogether,\r\nfor though, as will hereafter be seen, seven of them were eventually\r\nbrought to trial and convicted at the instance of another person, they\r\nreceived no adequate punishment, and were thus able to boast that\r\ngentlemen in their station of life in York were above the law.\r\n\r\nRash deeds often produce unlooked-for consequences. So it was in the\r\ncase under review. The attempt to suppress the _Advocate_ was the means\r\nof re-establishing it on a fairly satisfactory financial basis, and of\r\nextending its life for about seven years. The indignity to which the\r\nprinting-office had been subjected, and the trial resulting therefrom,\r\nhad furnished the best advertisements that could possibly have been\r\ndesired. With a portion of the sum recovered from the hands of the\r\nspoilers Mr. Mackenzie was able to satisfy the most pressing of his\r\ncreditors. With the balance he provided himself with new printing\r\nmaterial, and the _Advocate_ soon made its appearance under more\r\nfavourable auspices than ever. It continued to be marked by the same\r\ncharacteristics as during the first epoch of its existence. It was not\r\nconducted with more discretion, and there were as many gross\r\npersonalities in its columns. It however contributed much to the spread\r\nof Reform doctrines, and during much of its life it rendered undoubted\r\nservice to the party to which it yielded its support. Had the editor's\r\njudgment been commensurate with his energies, his journal would\r\nundoubtedly have been a great power for good. Even as it was, it\r\nprobably acted to some extent as a check upon Executive aggression, and\r\nthus served a beneficial purpose in spite of its many weaknesses and\r\nshortcomings.\r\n\r\nAs for Mr. Mackenzie, his persecutions were by no means at an end. They\r\nhad, in fact, only begun. Of the many other shameful indignities to\r\nwhich he was subjected--indignities which finally drove him into\r\nrebellion, and involved him in overwhelming disaster--the narrative will\r\nhereafter take full account. It is at present desirable to advert to a\r\nnumber of other pregnant examples of abuse of power in which Mr.\r\nMackenzie had no special concern.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[68] Vol. I., p. 89, et seq.\r\n\r\n[69] This portion of Front Street was then and for many years afterward\r\nknown as Palace Street. It had been so named, in the early years of\r\nYork's history, from the circumstance that it led down to the Parliament\r\nBuildings in the east end of the town, and because it was believed that\r\nthe official residence or \"palace\" of the Lieutenant-Governor would be\r\nbuilt there.\r\n\r\n[70] This historic landmark was burned down during the winter of 1854-5.\r\n\r\n[71] He had, as previously mentioned in the text, withdrawn from the\r\nProvince with a view to a settlement with his creditors. He was at\r\nLewiston, in the State of New York. In the beginning of the second part\r\nof his pamphlet, published at York in 1826, giving an account of the\r\naffair, he represents himself as having been at Queenston when he\r\nreceived news of the raid.\r\n\r\n[72] The statement to be found in various books--among others in Wells's\r\n_Canadiana_, p. 164, and Roger's _Rise of Canada from Barbarism to\r\nCivilization_, Vol. I., p. 405--that Mr. Mackenzie's mother was grossly\r\nmaltreated by the rioters is wholly without foundation. The affair was\r\ndisgraceful enough, in all conscience, and needs no fictitious\r\nembellishments.\r\n\r\n[73] _Ante_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[74] According to a contemporary pamphlet giving an account of the duel,\r\nwhich took place in 1817, he was then twenty-five years of age. He would\r\ntherefore be at least in his thirty-fourth year at the time of the press\r\nriot in 1826. By reference to the Barristers' Roll I find that he was\r\ncalled to the bar in Trinity Term, 55 Geo. III., 1815, at which time he\r\nmust have been at least twenty-one years old, so that the statement in\r\nthe text cannot be far from the fact. It is from him that Jarvis Street,\r\nToronto, derives its name.\r\n\r\n[75] The Hon. W. D. Powell ceased to be Chief Justice during the\r\nprevious year (1825), when he was succeeded by Mr. (afterwards Sir\r\nWilliam) Campbell.\r\n\r\n[76] _Ante_, p. 129.\r\n\r\n[77] Macaulay's _History of England_, Vol. I., Chapter 2.\r\n\r\n[78] _Statement of Facts relating to the Trespass on the Printing Press\r\nin the Possession of Mr. William Lyon Mackenzie, in June, 1826.\r\nAddressed to the Public generally, and particularly to the Subscribers\r\nand Supporters of the Colonial Advocate._ York, 1828.\r\n\r\n[79] See the _Freeman_ for Thursday, Feb. 21st, 1828.\r\n\r\n[80] See note to p. 130 _ante_.\r\n\r\n[81] Mr. Mackenzie, when taken before the Grand Jury to give evidence in\r\nsupport of a criminal prosecution of the type rioters, admitted that his\r\nactual, as distinguished from his incidental loss by the riot, did not\r\nexceed L12 10_s._ sterling.\r\n\r\n[82] It was the policy of the official party to suppress, as far as was\r\npracticable, all reference in the public newspapers to the misdoings of\r\nthemselves and their adherents. This was but natural. No one likes to\r\nsee his transgressions preserved to future ages in all the pitiless\r\ncoldness of type, which may rise up against his descendants long after\r\nhe himself is forgotten. The following is a complete transcript of the\r\ncontemporary report of the trial of these rioters, as published in _The\r\nU. E.

It may be added that the organ contained no reference\r\nwhatever to the type riot until many weeks after its occurrence.\r\n\r\n[83] Apparently they were not then aware that the publication had\r\nactually ceased before the riot took place.\r\n\r\n[84] _Life of Mackenzie_, Vol. I., p. 99.\r\n\r\n[85] See Dr. Scadding's _Toronto of Old_, p. 38. Mr. Baby's idiom was\r\ndue to his French origin and training.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF CAPTAIN MATTHEWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Matthews, who, it will be remembered, had been returned to the\r\nAssembly for the County of Middlesex, gave great umbrage to the official\r\nparty by allying himself with the Opposition. His birth and social\r\nstanding, it was said, unfitted him for such companionship. The Captain\r\nhimself was apparently conscious of no incongruity, and bent all his\r\nenergies to the advancement of the Reform cause. Upon his first arrival\r\nin the country he could not be said to have had any political\r\nconvictions at all. He had been bred a Tory, and his military career had\r\nbeen such as might naturally have led him to seek his allies in the\r\nranks of those in authority. But his own experience of the abuses in the\r\nLand Office had impelled him to consider the political situation of\r\naffairs in Upper Canada generally, and the upshot of his deliberations\r\nhad been his alliance with the new movement in the direction of Reform.\r\nBeing a man of much local influence, his example had won to his side a\r\nnumber of the Middlesex farmers, more especially in the Township of\r\nLobo, in which he resided. During his first session in Parliament he\r\nattracted considerable attention to himself, for he spoke frequently and\r\nwell, and generally with a humorous eloquence which made him a favourite\r\nwith those who were not bitter partisans on the other side.\r\n\r\nIt was to be expected that Captain Matthew's defection from the\r\npolitical faith of his ancestors would render him specially odious to\r\nthe High Tories of Upper Canada. It was shameful, they thought, that an\r\nofficer deriving an income from His Majesty's Government should\r\nentertain, much less give utterance to, such vile democratic opinions as\r\nwere constantly heard from his lips. The Captain was indiscreet, and\r\nbecame more and more outspoken the oftener he was charged with\r\nradicalism; but on no occasion did he utter anything savouring of\r\ndisloyalty, for the very sufficient reason that there was no disloyalty\r\nin his heart. It was apparent to the Compact that his influence was most\r\npernicious to them; yet no feasible plan for getting rid of him\r\npresented itself. Would it not be possible, by a little extra exertion,\r\nto deprive him of his pension? Could this laudable object be\r\naccomplished, the obnoxious Captain, who was of an impetuous\r\ntemperament, would probably be goaded into saying or doing something\r\nreally culpable--something which would place weapons in the hands of his\r\nenemies whereby he might be effectually silenced. The plan was at any\r\nrate worth trying. A system of espionage was accordingly adopted towards\r\nhim.[86] During the sitting of the Legislature, myrmidons of the\r\nExecutive dogged his footsteps wherever he went, in order to obtain some\r\ngrounds for a hostile accusation against him.\r\n\r\nThe spies did not have long to wait, for any shallow pretext was\r\nsufficient to serve as a peg upon which to hang an imputation of\r\ndisloyalty, and the doomed man himself was unsuspicious of any design\r\nagainst him. The pretext actually resorted to was so utterly\r\ncontemptible that one feels almost ashamed to record the attendant\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nA company of theatrical performers from the United States visited York\r\nduring the session which assembled in the autumn of 1825. The actors met\r\nwith little encouragement, and became, in stage parlance, \"stranded.\"\r\nBeing reduced to extremity, they resolved upon giving a special\r\nperformance for the delectation of the members of the Legislature, whose\r\npatronage was solicited for the occasion. Sixteen or eighteen of the\r\nmembers--among whom was Captain Matthews--complied with the\r\nsolicitation, and the performance took place at the little York theatre\r\non the night of December 31st. During the intervals between the acts the\r\norchestra played the national airs, \"God Save the King,\" \"Rule\r\nBritannia,\" and \"The British Grenadiers.\" Several persons in the\r\naudience--Captain Matthews among the number[87]--apparently out of\r\ncompliment to the actors, all of whom were from across the lines, called\r\nout for \"Yankee Doodle\" and \"Hail Columbia.\" The demand was complied\r\nwith, at least in part. The orchestra were unable to play \"Hail\r\nColumbia,\" but the audience were regaled with the lively strains of\r\n\"Yankee Doodle.\" Captain Matthews joined in the applause which followed,\r\nand removed his hat, calling upon others to do the same. The weight of\r\nevidence would seem to favour the idea that he was not the first to\r\nraise his hat, or to request the removal of the hats of his\r\nfellow-members. At all events the request was generally complied with.\r\nAnd this was the gist of the story. Captain Matthews's share in the\r\nevents of the evening was the having joined in the demand for the two\r\nobjectionable airs, in the applause which ensued upon the rendering of\r\none of them, and in the request for the uncovering of heads. These dire\r\noffences sealed the doom of a gallant officer who had served his king\r\nfor more than a quarter of a century, and whose acquiescence in the call\r\nfor the national airs of the republic was probably due, at least in\r\npart, to the effervescence of feeling begotten of a good dinner.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to trace, step by step, the progress of the measures\r\nadopted against him. Distorted and exaggerated accounts appeared in _The\r\nKingston Chronicle_ and _The Quebec Mercury_. But it is hardly likely\r\nthat any _ex officio_ notice would have been taken of the affair if the\r\nnewspaper reports had not been backed by a specific charge. Captain\r\nMatthews appears to have been secretly accused to the military\r\nauthorities. He soon afterwards received a letter from the military\r\nsecretary to the Earl of Dalhousie, Commander of the Forces in Lower\r\nCanada, stating that that dignitary's attention had been attracted by a\r\nreport in the public prints of a representation that Captain Matthews\r\nhad, in a riotous and outrageous manner, in the theatre at York, called\r\nfor the national airs and tunes of the United States, \"urging the\r\naudience there assembled to take off their hats, as is usual in the\r\nBritish Dominions in honour of 'God Save the King.'\" The letter went on\r\nto say that \"finding the statement corroborated, upon inquiry,\" the\r\nCommander of the Forces called upon Captain Matthews to explain conduct\r\nwhich was pronounced to be \"utterly disloyal and disgraceful.\" Even this\r\nwas not all. By a subsequent letter, received from the Board of\r\nOrdnance, the Captain was directed to repair forthwith to Quebec, and\r\nthere remain until he could, by the first vessel in the spring, proceed\r\nto England, there to give an account of his conduct. This order was\r\nstated to have been made in consequence of a communication from the\r\nauthorities in Canada to Lord Bathurst, the Colonial Secretary, and by\r\nhim transmitted to the Master-General and Board of Ordnance.\r\n\r\nMr. Mackenzie asserts that the object of the authorities was to get the\r\nCaptain out of the Province, and thus deprive the Opposition of his\r\nvote, \"in order to give the local Government a preponderance in the\r\nLegislature against the people's rights.\"[88] This, however, can hardly\r\nbe accepted as a full or true explanation, as the Captain's absence at\r\nthe time would not have given such a preponderance to the Government on\r\nany test vote. The weakening of the Opposition may or may not have been\r\none of the objects sought to be achieved by the Captain's accusers. If\r\nso, it signally failed. Captain Matthews, be it understood, was not in\r\nreceipt of half-pay, but of a pension. He had served twenty-seven years,\r\nand, on his corps being totally disbanded, he had settled in Upper\r\nCanada with the approbation of the Government. Having since been elected\r\na member of the Provincial Assembly, his first duty was to that body,\r\nand it was necessary that he should obtain its leave before proceeding\r\nto obey the order of the Master-General. Accordingly, on Thursday, the\r\n28th of December, 1826, he rose in his place and made a motion involving\r\nan application for leave of absence. He explained the circumstances,\r\nand, in the course of the debate which ensued, expressly stated that he\r\nasked for leave, not with any desire of its being granted, but merely in\r\norder that the House might do its duty. The Opposition stood faithfully\r\nby him in this emergency. The House felt that the honour of one of its\r\nmembers was concerned. It refused the application for leave, and, on\r\nmotion of Mr. Rolph, set on foot an inquiry into the circumstances on\r\nits own behalf.\r\n\r\nThe inquiry was searching and minute, and the witnesses were not\r\nexamined in presence of each other. Much of the evidence was beyond\r\nmeasure ludicrous and absurd. The scene at the theatre was described by\r\none witness after another in endless variety. The merits of \"Yankee\r\nDoodle\" and \"Hail Columbia,\" philologically and aesthetically, were made\r\nthe subjects of the gravest investigation. It appeared that with the\r\nexception of Mr. John Beikie, Clerk of the Executive Council, and a very\r\nfew of the townspeople, the audience was entirely made up of members of\r\nthe Legislature. There were no ladies present, and, as it was New Year's\r\nEve, the audience generally felt a considerable freedom from restraint.\r\nMany of the members had partaken freely of the cup that\r\ncheers--assuredly not the cup indicated by Cowper--and were in the\r\nblissful condition of Tam O'Shanter upon a certain memorable occasion to\r\nwhich no more specific reference is necessary. In plain English, some of\r\nthem were so drunk as to be unable to recall anything that occurred. All\r\nwere full of mirth and jollity, and the scene enacted was of the most\r\nuproarious description. Three grave legislators \"danced while 'Yankee\r\nDoodle' was played.\" Several others had reached the quarrelsome stage of\r\ninebriety, and, in the language of one of the witnesses, \"showed fight.\"\r\nMr. Philip Vankoughnet, one of the members for Stormont, was constrained\r\nto admit that he had stripped off his coat, and threatened to knock\r\nsomebody down. Captain Matthews, among others, called for \"Hail\r\nColumbia\" and \"Yankee Doodle,\" but the general opinion among the more\r\nsober of the party appeared to be that he had done so \"in derision.\" It\r\nwas a bibulous age, and sobriety was the exception rather than the\r\nrule. The whole affair was little better than a bar-room orgy, and\r\ncould properly be regarded in no other light.\r\n\r\nWhen the Assembly's report made its appearance, early in 1827, Captain\r\nMatthews was fully exonerated, so far as that body was concerned, from\r\neverything savouring of disloyalty. \"The circumstances of the\r\ntransaction\"--thus ran the report--\"as they are related without the\r\ncontradiction of a single witness, irresistibly bespeak the absence of\r\nthat disloyalty with which it has been basely attempted to sully the\r\ncharacter of a most honourable man.\" The report moreover read a sharp\r\nlesson to the promoters of the accusation against him. It declared that\r\n\"If every effervescence of feeling upon every jovial or innocent\r\noccasion is, in these Provinces, to be magnified into crime by the\r\ntestimony of secret informers--if there can longer exist a political\r\ninquisition which shall scan the motives of every faithful servant of\r\nthe public--if the authorities in Canada shall humble the independence\r\nof the Legislature by scandalizing its members and causing them to be\r\nordered to Quebec, and thence to England, to sustain a fate which, under\r\nsuch corroboration as Lord Dalhousie received, might cover them with\r\nignominy, or bring them, however innocent, to the block--or if the\r\nmembers of our community shall be awed into political subserviency by\r\nfear of oppression, or lured by the corrupt hope of participating guilty\r\nfavours, then, indeed, will the prospect before us four, and this fine\r\nProvince become a distant appendage of a mighty empire, ruled by a few\r\naspiring men with the scourge of power.\"[89]\r\n\r\nThe Committee professed their inability to learn by whom the pernicious\r\nrepresentations had been made to the newspapers, or to the authorities\r\nin Canada, or from what source Lord Dalhousie had obtained his\r\n\"corroboration.\" They expressed their conviction that there was no\r\nground for the charge preferred against Captain Matthews, the malignity\r\nand falsity of which they believed to have derived their origin and\r\nsupport from political hostility towards him.\r\n\r\nThe United States press was loud in its expressions of contempt. \"Behold\r\nhow great a matter a little fire kindleth;\" said _The New York\r\nEnquirer_--\"truly, there is something very undignified in such\r\nvexatious stretches of authority\"--referring, of course, to the attempt\r\nto drag Captain Matthews across the Atlantic on a charge depending on\r\nsuch ridiculous evidence. Attention was drawn to the fact that the\r\nnational airs of Great Britain, \"God Save the Queen,\" and \"Rule\r\nBritannia,\" are often heard at theatres and elsewhere in the republic\r\nwithout any such momentous consequences, and without being received\r\neither with laughter, dancing or contempt. \"The evidence,\" continued the\r\n_Enquirer_, \"does not speak very strongly in favour of the amenity and\r\ndecorum of the M. P.'s of Upper Canada. If calling for one of our\r\nnational airs, in a time of profound peace, within a few miles of the\r\nfrontiers, is regarded as an unpardonable crime by the British\r\nGovernment, who shall wonder or complain that the British people are\r\nfull of prejudice against us.\" The Liberal press of the Maritime\r\nProvinces harped to the same tune. \"Really,\" remarked _The Halifax\r\nRecorder_, \"we think people must have their wits about them now-a-days,\r\nif such things as these are to be construed into disaffection.\"\r\n\r\nBut though Captain Matthews had been cleared by the Legislature, he had\r\nstill to run the gauntlet of the military inquisition. They could not\r\ncompel his attendance during the existence of the Parliament then in\r\nbeing, but they possessed an effectual means of reducing him to ultimate\r\nsubmission. This power they exercised. His pension was stopped--a very\r\nserious matter to a man with a large family and many responsibilities.\r\nHe continued to fight the battles of Reform with dogged courage and\r\npertinacity as long as his means admitted of his doing so, but he was\r\nsoon reduced to a condition of great pecuniary distress, and was\r\ncompelled to succumb. Broken-hearted and worn out, he resigned his seat\r\nin the Assembly, and returned to England, where, after grievous delays,\r\nhe succeeded in getting his pension restored. He never returned to\r\nCanada, and survived the restoration of his pension but a short time.\r\nThus, through the malignity of a selfish and secret cabal, was Upper\r\nCanada deprived of the services of a zealous and useful citizen and\r\nlegislator, whose residence among us, had it been continued, could not\r\nhave failed to advance the cause of freedom and justice.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[86] That spies were employed by Sir Peregrine Maitland and his Council,\r\nand that certain Government officials were encouraged to act in that\r\ncapacity, are facts which will be denied by no one who familiarizes\r\nhimself with the local legislative, official and newspaper literature of\r\nthe time. An apparently well-informed contributor to _Blackwood's\r\nMagazine_ for September, 1829, in an article headed \"Colonial\r\nDiscontent,\" comments on this retrograde system in the following\r\nterms:--\"A system of espionage assumes that there is something which\r\nought to be watched and to be prevented; and as the existence of such a\r\nsystem probably did exist in Upper Canada during the administration of\r\nSir Peregrine Maitland, it may be said that so far his Government was\r\nled to act on false principles.... We do not suppose that there was\r\nanything like an organized system, but only that tales to the personal\r\ndisadvantage of the Anti-Ministerial party were too readily listened to.\r\nNo doubt the members of that party were as credulous in listening to\r\ntales to the prejudice of the adherents of Government, but then they had\r\nit not in their power, like them, to inflict punishment. It is\r\nunnecessary to explain in what manner a system of espionage begets\r\nheart-burnings. It is to the public what tattle and malicious gossip are\r\nto private society, with this essential difference, however, that the\r\ntale of the slanderer is in time forgotten or refuted, whereas the\r\nreport of the spy is received in secret, placed in the confidential\r\narchives of office, and referred to as a testimonial of character, in\r\nwhich such set of testimonials can be applied with effect when the\r\noccasion arises.\"\r\n\r\n[87] Mr. Mackenzie, in his _Sketches of Canada and the United States_,\r\np. 419, denies that Captain Matthews called for these airs, as stated in\r\nthe text. But anyone who carefully examines into the Provincial events\r\nof those times will not be long in arriving at the conclusion that Mr.\r\nMackenzie's unsupported testimony, more especially as to matters in any\r\nway coming within the scope of politics, is of very little value. The\r\nevidence as to the Captain's having called for \"Yankee Doodle\" is\r\nconclusive. That his doing so constituted a serious offence is another\r\nmatter, as to which there will, at the present day, be very little\r\ndifference of opinion.\r\n\r\n[88] _Sketches of Canada_, etc., p. 419.\r\n\r\n[89] See Journal of Assembly for 1826-7, Appendix P.

In the latter case\r\nthere was no gross violation of the decencies of life, or of the outward\r\nforms of law. The mischief was effected by means of spies and secret\r\ninformation, and the damage inflicted was incidental rather than direct.\r\nThe Forsyth case, on the contrary, was more in the manner of the type\r\nriot. It was a violent and utterly unjustifiable exercise of brute\r\nforce. But in one important respect it was worse than the type riot.\r\n_That_ display of ruffianism had been accomplished without the open\r\napprobation of the authorities. The Niagara Falls outrage was committed\r\nnot only with the full assent, but by the express command, of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor himself. Not even the poor excuse that it was done\r\nin a moment of anger or irritation could be made for it. It was done\r\ndeliberately, in cold blood, and was as deliberately repeated. It was a\r\nsimple case of Might _versus_ Right.\r\n\r\nA few words of explanation are necessary by way of prologue.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1786, before the setting apart of Upper Canada as a separate\r\nProvince, and just after the commencement of the settlement of the\r\nNiagara Peninsula by Butler's Rangers, the territory contiguous to the\r\nwest bank of the Niagara River was surveyed and laid out into lots by\r\nAugustus Jones, a surveyor whose name is familiar to all students of the\r\nearly history of this Province. In pursuance of instructions received\r\nfrom the Government, Mr. Jones, in laying out these lots, made a\r\nreservation of a chain in width--sixty-six feet--along the top of the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nThe reservation was made partly with a view to the military defence of\r\nthe Province, and partly for the purpose of preserving a convenient\r\ncommunication.[90] It was expressly specified in the Crown Patents to\r\nthe owners of adjoining lands, and embodied in all subsequent deeds upon\r\nsuccessive transfers. It may therefore be conceded that the Crown's\r\ntitle to the reserved land was indisputable.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1827, and for some time previously, the principal inn on the\r\nCanadian side of the river at Niagara Falls was owned and kept by one\r\nWilliam Forsyth. The man and his establishment were well known to\r\ntravellers, and \"Forsyth's\" had a high reputation as one of the most\r\ncomfortable houses of public entertainment in the country. During the\r\nheat of summer, many residents of York paid more or less frequent visits\r\nto the Falls, not more to enjoy the change of air and the majestic\r\nscenery, than to partake of \"mine host\" Forsyth's hospitality. The inn\r\nwas in close proximity to the great cataract, and was known as the\r\nNiagara Falls Pavilion. It was built on ground that bordered upon and\r\nran up to the Government's reservation, which alone intervened between\r\nit and the top of the bank.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827.]\r\n\r\nMr. Forsyth drove a flourishing business, but, like some of his\r\nsuccessors at the same spot, his greed grew with his increasing gains,\r\nand he was not content to grow rich by degrees. He determined to augment\r\nhis income by the erection of a high post and rail fence, placed so as\r\nto shut out visitors from approaching near to the Falls, and rendering\r\nit necessary for them to pass through his house before the desired view\r\ncould be obtained. It should be mentioned that Mr. Forsyth, in addition\r\nto the Pavilion and its immediate grounds, owned the adjoining lands for\r\na considerable distance, including all the points from which the great\r\nspectacle was to be seen to advantage. By the erection of the fence,\r\ntherefore, visitors would be debarred and shut off from all that was\r\nbest worth seeing in the neighbourhood, until they had passed through\r\nhis inn; and it was of course anticipated that most of those so passing\r\nthrough would spend more or less money on the premises. There was,\r\nhowever, one rather serious objection to the contemplated change. It\r\nwould involve the enclosure of the Government reservation, a proceeding\r\nwhich was not likely to be permanently tolerated. Forsyth was probably\r\nill advised by his attorney in the matter, for he seems to have been\r\nreally of opinion that the Government's title to the land was at least\r\nopen to question, and he had been permitted to occupy a portion of it\r\nwithout remonstrance for about six years. Sometime during the early\r\nspring of the above-mentioned year--in time to catch the expected influx\r\nof summer visitors--he carried out his design, and constructed the\r\nenclosure. His house was thus converted into a thoroughfare, which\r\nnecessarily gave rise to a greatly increased number of visitors, and to\r\nmuch additional expenditure within its walls. But the public serenity\r\nsoon began to show signs of disturbance. There was a rival innkeeper\r\nnamed Browne, who was not long in discovering that his own losses were\r\nin proportion to Forsyth's gains. He bestirred himself in the matter,\r\nand soon succeeded in arousing a good deal of indignation in the minds\r\nof visitors. No one was allowed to either enter or pass by his door\r\nwithout being importuned to sign a petition to the Government, praying\r\nfor a removal of the objectionable fence. Other persons residing in the\r\nneighbourhood took umbrage at the innovation, and also made appeals to\r\nthe Government on the subject. In this way several numerously-signed\r\npetitions were obtained and forwarded to headquarters.\r\n\r\nSuch proceedings as these were in themselves reasonable and proper\r\nenough. Forsyth had acted in a selfish and unwarrantable manner, and it\r\nwould have been nothing more than he had a right to expect if the\r\nGovernment had instituted immediate action against him. It would have\r\nbeen an injustice to the public if he had been permitted to enjoy his\r\nmonopoly undisturbed. But neither the trespasser himself nor any of\r\nthose who protested against his conduct was prepared for such\r\nhigh-handed measures as were actually resorted to; measures which\r\neffectually proved the unfitness of Sir Peregrine Maitland for his high\r\noffice; which led to his being cordially hated throughout the length\r\nand breadth of Upper Canada; and which doubtless had something to do\r\nwith his removal to another sphere of action.\r\n\r\nOne day about the middle of May, when the enclosure had been erected\r\nabout six weeks, and when the season's regular flow of tourists had\r\nfairly set in, the landlord of the Pavilion received a call from Captain\r\nGeorge Phillpotts, of the Royal Engineers, who then held command in the\r\nDistrict. The latter demanded why Forsyth had presumed to fence-in the\r\nGovernment reserve. Forsyth replied, denying that the reserve belonged\r\nto the Government, and asserting his own title thereto, whereupon he was\r\ninformed that unless the enclosure was removed without delay, he,\r\nCaptain Phillpotts, would himself undertake its removal. Forsyth\r\nprofessed to feel strong in his rights, and threatened to prosecute the\r\nCaptain or any one else who might interfere with his property. Here the\r\ninterview ended. Several days afterwards--on the 18th--the landlord was\r\nsummoned to his door by a message that a gentleman there wished to see\r\nhim. The gentleman proved to be Captain Phillpotts, who was accompanied\r\nby a sergeant and four other soldiers in fatigue jackets, without arms.\r\nMajor Richard Leonard, Sheriff of the Niagara District, and Augustus\r\nJones, who had made the original survey of the property forty-one years\r\nbefore, were also in attendance. The Sheriff, who had merely accompanied\r\nthe party at the Captain's request, took no part in the subsequent\r\nproceedings, but contented himself with quietly looking on. Mr. Jones\r\nhad been brought for a specific purpose, and, at the request of Captain\r\nPhillpotts, he then and there made a hasty re-survey of the reserve, the\r\nlimits of which he indicated by pickets. Upon the completion of this\r\ntask, the Captain demanded that Forsyth should immediately remove the\r\nenclosing fence, and upon his refusal to do so, the soldiers, under\r\norders from their Captain, deliberately cut and threw down the fence,\r\nexposing the gardens, meadows and about sixty acres of growing crops to\r\nwaste. A blacksmith's shop which had been erected on the reserve was\r\ndemolished, and the building material thrown over the bank. The Captain\r\navowed that he was acting under express orders from the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, which proved to be the fact.\r\n\r\nHaving accomplished his purpose, Captain Phillpotts and his soldiers\r\ndeparted, accompanied by the Sheriff and the surveyor. They were no\r\nsooner out of the way than Forsyth and his servants set themselves to\r\nwork to repair damages, and before nightfall the enclosure was rebuilt;\r\nthe premises, with the exception of the blacksmith's shop, being\r\nrestored to the condition in which they had been before the assault upon\r\nthem. But intelligence of the restoration was speedily conveyed to Sir\r\nPeregrine Maitland, who again despatched the same emissary, and the\r\ndrama of demolition was re-enacted. The landlord of the Pavilion then\r\ngave up the contest, so far as any attempt at reconstruction was\r\nconcerned, and proceeded to obtain redress by due course of law.\r\n\r\nNow, it may perhaps be admitted that Forsyth was rightly served, or at\r\nany rate that he deserved little or no sympathy. His enclosure of the\r\nCrown reserve had been without any strict colour of right, and had been\r\ndue to pure greed and selfishness. But his blacksmith's shop had been\r\nconstructed on the land as far back as 1821, when he had purchased the\r\nadjoining lot from William Dickson, and no one had ever questioned his\r\nright to maintain it there. He seems to have thought that he had as good\r\na claim to the property as anybody. He had been informed, contrary to\r\nthe fact, that the Government reserve extended only to the lower bank,\r\nand did not cover the land at the top. He might easily have discovered\r\nthat his information was misleading, but he had not chosen to take so\r\nmuch trouble, and deserved to suffer the legal consequences of his\r\nneglect. He could undoubtedly have been dispossessed by means of an\r\naction of ejectment, with the costs of which he would justly have been\r\nsaddled. But he had a right to expect that, after being allowed to\r\nremain so many years in undisturbed possession, he should only be\r\ndispossessed by civil process. It was not a case where an arbitrary\r\nremoval was justifiable, such as may lawfully take place when it becomes\r\nnecessary to abate a nuisance. But it was above all things intolerable\r\nthat the military should have been employed for such a purpose. Sir\r\nPeregrine Maitland, in sending Captain Phillpotts on the expedition, had\r\nacted, not in his capacity of Lieutenant-Governor, but in that of\r\nMajor-General Commanding the Forces in Upper Canada. This it was that\r\nwrought up the public pulse to such a pitch of excitement. This it was\r\nthat created a dangerous antagonism between the people and the soldiery,\r\nand led to frequent quarrels and bickerings between them. The Committee\r\nsubsequently appointed by the Assembly to investigate the subject echoed\r\nthe popular sentiment when they reported that \"a person long in\r\npossession of land, like the petitioner, ought to have been ejected by\r\nthe law of the land, which is ample, when impartially administered, for\r\nsecuring the rights of property, but the interference of the military,\r\nby such acts of violence, for maintaining supposed or contested rights,\r\nis justly regarded with jealousy in all free countries, and ought to be\r\nseriously regarded in a colony where the most unprecedented outrages\r\nhave been perpetrated without prosecution, and even followed by the\r\npatronage of the local Government upon the wrong-doers.\"[91] The\r\npresence of the civil power on the occasion, in the person of the\r\nSheriff, had been even an aggravation of the offence, for the Sheriff\r\nhad thus been made to lend his countenance to the proceeding. As for the\r\nLieutenant-Governor's action in the matter, he himself was solely to\r\nblame, for his intentions were not made known to the Executive Council,\r\nor, so far as appears, to any member of that body. It was simply and\r\nsolely a barefaced and most impudent abuse of authority, the\r\nresponsibility for which rests upon no shoulders but his own.\r\n\r\nForsyth had no success in his appeals to the law. He brought two actions\r\nof trespass, one of which was against Sheriff Leonard and Captain\r\nPhillpotts jointly, for removing the fence and blacksmith's shop; and\r\nthe other of which was against Captain Phillpotts alone for removing the\r\nfence the second time. Sir Peregrine instructed Attorney-General\r\nRobinson to defend both these suits, and to vindicate the Crown's title\r\nto the reserved land.[92] To effect the latter object in the most formal\r\nand decisive manner, the Attorney-General filed an information for\r\nintrusion against Forsyth, upon which a verdict was rendered in favour\r\nof the Crown. The plaintiff altogether failed in his action against\r\nPhillpotts and the Sheriff, and the decision in that case rendered it\r\nuseless for him to proceed with the action against Phillpotts alone.[93]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828.]\r\n\r\nWhile those suits were in progress, Forsyth, finding that public\r\nopinion, if not in his favour, was at least hostile to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, sent in a petition to the Assembly, setting forth\r\nthe circumstances, and praying for redress. This was during the session\r\nof 1828. The Assembly entertained the petition, and appointed a\r\nCommittee of Inquiry. The Committee proceeded to inquire accordingly.\r\nWhile their investigations were in progress they resolved to examine two\r\nof the Government officials, who, as there was reason to believe, could\r\nthrow light upon Sir Peregrine's reasons for such arbitrary conduct as\r\nthat of which he had been guilty. The officials whose evidence it was\r\nthought desirable to obtain were Colonels Coffin and Givins, both of\r\nwhom were heads of departments. The former occupied the position of\r\nAdjutant-General of Militia for Upper Canada; the latter was\r\nSuperintendent of Indian Affairs. Both of these gentlemen were summoned\r\nto attend before the Committee at a specified time. In this there was\r\nnothing strange or unusual. It was a matter of frequent occurrence for\r\nofficials of the Government, high and low, to be summoned before\r\nParliamentary committees while the Legislature was in session; and there\r\nwas no question as to the right of such committees to require such\r\nattendance. In this instance, however, the persons summoned were not\r\npermitted to obey the behests of the Committee, and in the attendant\r\ncircumstances there were pretty plain indications of crookedness and\r\ncollusion between the Crown officers and Sir Peregrine Maitland. Each of\r\nthe two officers concerned, immediately upon receiving his summons,\r\ncaused the fact to be communicated to the Lieutenant-Governor, and each\r\nwrote a shuffling letter to the Chairman of the Committee. Later in the\r\nday the Lieutenant-Governor positively declined to permit the attendance\r\nof the persons summoned, assigning as a reason that he had not been made\r\nacquainted with the facts as to which it was desired to interrogate\r\nthem. Now, when one considers all the facts and circumstances of the\r\ncase, one is driven to the conclusion that Colonels Coffin and Givins\r\nwere in possession of certain information which the Executive, or at any\r\nrate the Lieutenant-Governor, had a strong interest in keeping secret.\r\nWhy else were they forbidden to attend? The reason assigned was\r\ncertainly not a sufficient one. In the first place it was not founded\r\nupon fact. That the Committee had been appointed for the specific\r\npurpose of investigating the circumstances connected with the Niagara\r\nFalls outrage was matter of common notoriety. When the two Government\r\nofficers were summoned to give evidence before that Committee there\r\ncould be no doubt that the intention was to examine them touching their\r\nknowledge of the matter in hand.[94] Some years before this time, when\r\nthe Compact were all-powerful in the Assembly, as well as in the Upper\r\nHouse, a custom had been introduced of notifying the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nwhenever it was proposed to examine any of the Government officials as\r\nwitnesses before a Parliamentary committee. It had been customary to\r\nspecify, in the address of notification, the subject on which it was\r\nintended to take evidence. This, however, had been a mere matter of\r\ncourtesy and conventionality, upon which nobody had any right to insist;\r\nand the practice had not been uniform or consistent, various instances\r\nhaving occurred where Crown officers had been summoned and examined as\r\nwitnesses without any such notification having been given. Upon such a\r\nflimsy pretext, however, did Sir Peregrine Maitland base his refusal to\r\npermit the two witnesses to attend for examination in the Forsyth case.\r\n\r\nThe Chairman of the Committee duly reported to the Assembly the\r\nnon-attendance of the witnesses, and that body determined that its\r\nauthority should not thus be defied and set at naught with impunity. The\r\nchief offender, the Lieutenant-Governor--or the Commander of the Forces,\r\nif he was to be considered as acting in that capacity--was of course\r\nbeyond reach, but proceedings were forthwith instituted against the\r\nrecalcitrant witnesses. Warrants were issued against them by the\r\nSpeaker, in order that they might be brought up before the House, in\r\ncustody of the Sergeant-at-Arms, to answer for their contempt. Acting\r\nunder legal advice, they declined to submit to such authority unless\r\ncompelled to do so by force; and they boldly threatened that in case of\r\nforce being resorted to they would prosecute the Speaker. It is to be\r\npresumed that the warrants would in any case have been acted upon, but\r\nthis impudent threat left the Assembly no alternative. If Government\r\nofficers, paid out of the public purse, were to be allowed to defy that\r\nbranch of the Legislature which alone represented the popular voice--if\r\nthey were to be permitted to treat its mandates with contempt, and to\r\nthreaten its representative with ulterior consequences in the event of\r\nthose mandates being enforced--then, indeed, liberty and equal rights\r\nwere at a low ebb in Upper Canada. The warrants were promptly executed,\r\nthe house in which the two officials had ensconced themselves being\r\nforcibly entered for the purpose. Being brought to the bar of the House,\r\nand charged with their contempt, they sought to vindicate themselves by\r\npleading the action of the Lieutenant-Governor in refusing to sanction\r\ntheir attendance. The House then adopted a resolution under which they\r\nwere handed over to the custody of the Sheriff, and committed to the\r\ncommon jail of the Home District. They formally notified the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, through his private secretary, of the calamity\r\nwhich had come upon them through obedience to his behests, and requested\r\nthat the advice and assistance of the Crown officers--that is to say, of\r\nthe Attorney-General and Solicitor-General--might be vouchsafed to them.\r\nThey however remained in confinement only three days, for the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, in accordance with an intimation previously given,\r\nprorogued the Legislature on the 25th of March--they had been committed\r\non the 22nd--and the power of the Assembly to commit did not extend\r\nbeyond the time when it was actually in session.\r\n\r\nColonels Coffin and Givins carried out their threat, and sued the\r\nSpeaker for damages for false imprisonment. The right of the Assembly to\r\ncommit for contempt was however a matter too well established, and was\r\nconfirmed by the Court of King's Bench in another cause then pending. So\r\nthat the Adjutant-General of Militia and the Superintendent of Indian\r\nAffairs, in addition to their respective bills of costs, had their three\r\ndays' imprisonment as a reward for their fealty to Sir Peregrine\r\nMaitland, and for their disloyalty to the Canadian people.\r\n\r\nSir Peregrine appears to have felt a little dubious as to how his\r\nproceedings would be regarded at the Home Office. It was quite certain\r\nthat the Colonial Secretary would hear of the affair, but that\r\ndignitary's approval was open to question. It would at all events be\r\nwell that the official mind should receive its first impression on the\r\nsubject from Sir Peregrine himself, who accordingly lost no time in\r\nsending over his own version of the transaction. His despatch, which\r\nbears internal evidence of having been written or revised by\r\nAttorney-General Robinson, is dated the 29th of March--the fourth day\r\nafter the prorogation. Under the pretext of asking for advice as to how\r\nhe should act in the future in case of any of the officials being\r\nsummoned before Parliamentary committees without any notification having\r\nbeen made to himself, he recounts the story of the Niagara Falls\r\noutrage. His narrative, it is almost needless to say, is from first to\r\nlast garbled and one-sided. Forsyth is referred to therein as \"a person\r\nnotoriously of indifferent character;\" and the Assembly and its\r\ncommittees are maligned in language highly improper to be employed in a\r\nconfidential communication from the Lieutenant-Governor of a colony to\r\nhis superiors at home.[95] The Colonial Secretary, however, was shrewd\r\nenough to penetrate the veil of misrepresentation in which the despatch\r\nwas enveloped, and to arrive at a pretty just appreciation of the merits\r\nof the case. He officially expressed his opinion that there had been\r\nadequate grounds for inquiry by the Assembly. \"I cannot but consider,\"\r\nhe wrote, \"that Sir Peregrine Maitland would have exercised a sounder\r\ndiscretion had he permitted the officers to appear before the Assembly;\r\nand I regret that he did not accomplish the object he had in view in\r\npreventing Forsyth's encroachments by means of the civil power, which is\r\nsaid to have been at hand, rather than by calling in military aid.\" This\r\ndespatch, however, was written, not to Sir Peregrine Maitland himself,\r\nbut to his successor, Sir John Colborne. The Forsyth case, coming, as\r\nit did, in the wake of other ill-advised proceedings on the part of Sir\r\nPeregrine, determined the Home Government to withdraw him from Upper\r\nCanada, where it was quite evident that his usefulness--if he had ever\r\nhad any--was gone. He was transferred to Nova Scotia, whither it is not\r\nnecessary that this narrative should follow him.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Forsyth, it may he added that, being unable to obtain\r\nany recompense for the Phillpotts invasion, and being harassed by\r\nprotracted litigation, he sold his property at Niagara Falls at a price\r\nconsiderably below its value, and removed from the spot. It cannot be\r\nsaid that he deserved much sympathy, for he had brought his losses on\r\nhimself by his own selfishness. He took advantage of the situation to\r\npose in the character of a martyr to Executive tyranny, and he succeeded\r\nin deceiving many of his contemporaries into the belief that he was a\r\nmuch injured man. The historical interest, however, centres not in him,\r\nbut in the consequences arising out of the employment of soldiers to do\r\nthe Sheriff's work in a time of profound peace, and without any\r\ninitiatory civil process having been issued. The popular excitement\r\nconsequent on the outrage encouraged Forsyth to petition the Assembly.\r\nThe petition led to the appointment of the Committee of Inquiry, which\r\nin its turn led to the summoning of witnesses and the conflict between\r\nthe Assembly and the Lieutenant-Governor. The conflict led to the\r\nlatter's removal, and, from that point of view, is not to be regarded in\r\nthe light of an unmixed evil.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[90] See the letter from Chief Justice Robinson to Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nRowan, Secretary, etc., etc., dated at York, 31st December, 1832, and\r\nappended to the Report of the Committee of the House of Assembly on the\r\nPetition of William Forsyth, dated April 1st, 1835. In one part of this\r\nletter the Chief Justice says that the laying out of the lots took place\r\n\"some time between the years 1785 and 1790, and while General Haldimand\r\nadministered the Government of Canada.\" General Haldimand did not\r\nadminister the Government of Canada during any part of the time thus\r\nspecified--a fact of which Chief Justice Robinson ought to have been\r\naware. In a subsequent part of the same letter he properly gives the\r\ndate as 1786.\r\n\r\n[91] See the report, p. iv., appended to the _Seventh Report of the\r\nGrievance Committee_.\r\n\r\n[92] The defence of these two suits would seem to have been the means of\r\nconsiderably augmenting the Attorney-General's already ample income.\r\nFrom certain accounts sent down to the Assembly it appears that a sum of\r\n_L127 6s. 6-3/4d._ sterling were paid to him during the year 1834 for\r\n\"expenses incurred by him in defending two suits with costs in reference\r\nto the military reserve near the Falls of Niagara.\"\r\n\r\n[93] There was a very general belief throughout the Niagara District at\r\nthe time that Major Leonard, who was an obedient servant to the\r\nExecutive, had manipulated the lists from which the jurors in those\r\ncases were selected. The truth or falsity of the belief cannot now be\r\npronounced upon, the circumstances upon which it was founded being\r\nburied in oblivion.\r\n\r\n[94] \"He [Sir Peregrine Maitland] must have inferred that the Committee\r\nproposed to examine these officers respecting the employment of a\r\nmilitary force for the ejecting of Forsyth from the land.\"--See Despatch\r\nfrom the Colonial Secretary, Sir George Murray, to Major-General Sir\r\nJohn Colborne, dated 20th October, 1828, appended to the Report on\r\nForsyth's petition.\r\n\r\n[95] See the despatch, appended to the Report on the Forsyth Case, at\r\nend of Grievance Committee's Report.

JUSTICE WILLIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Forsyth embroilment extended over a long period, and from time to\r\ntime during several years it continued, at longer or shorter intervals,\r\nto thrust itself upon public attention. Meanwhile it was not the only\r\ninstance of abuse of power on the part of the Executive to which the\r\npeople of Upper Canada were constrained to submit. Several other notable\r\ncontemporaneous examples shared with it in the unenviable work of\r\nwidening the breach between the Government and the people, and in\r\ndestroying popular confidence in the impartial administration of\r\njustice. It is a rather singular fact that of all the many high-handed\r\nmeasures resorted to during the existence of the Ninth Parliament, the\r\none which aroused the greatest indignation was perhaps the least\r\nblameworthy of them all. It has been the fashion with writers who have\r\ndealt with this period of our history to represent the amoval of Justice\r\nWillis as being upon the whole the most glaring iniquity of the time.\r\nThis view is not borne out by the facts. In the Willis affair Sir\r\nPeregrine Maitland had recourse to the espionage system, and certainly\r\nwent to the utmost verge of his authority, but he cannot be said to have\r\nrun violently in the teeth of precedent and good sense, as was done, for\r\ninstance, in the Forsyth case. Nor can it be said that he acted with\r\ndespotic rashness or precipitation. His decade of misrule in Upper\r\nCanada was characterized by many cruel, tyrannical and shameful deeds:\r\ndeeds which stare out from the pages of the past with lurid\r\ndistinctness. He has enough to answer for at the bar of history; and it\r\nis quite unnecessary to load the formidable indictment against him with\r\nsurplusage or dubious matter. A careful and dispassionate examination of\r\nall the circumstances in the Willis case must convince the inquirer that\r\nthe faults were not all on one side, and that the Judge himself is\r\nbound to at least share with Sir Peregrine the responsibility for the\r\nbitterness arising out of the \"amoval.\"\r\n\r\nJohn Walpole Willis, whose name was destined to win considerable\r\ncelebrity in the judicial annals of this Province; was a lawyer of good\r\nstanding at the English Chancery bar. He came of a respectable county\r\nfamily, but had no hereditary expectations, and from his earliest youth\r\nhad applied himself to study with a zeal begotten of the conviction that\r\nhe would be compelled to depend upon his own exertions for a livelihood.\r\nHe devoted himself with assiduity to studying the literature pertaining\r\nto the equity branch of the law. By the time he reached manhood he had\r\nacquired considerable erudition, and it was predicted of him that he\r\nwould make a mark in his profession. He did his utmost to justify the\r\nprediction, for he had no sooner been called to the bar than he came\r\nbefore the world as an author. His first publication was a work bearing\r\nupon the law of Evidence. In 1820 he issued a work on Equity Pleading;\r\nand in 1827 appeared his treatise \"On the Duties and responsibilities of\r\nTrustees.\" These works obtained a fair share of recognition, and\r\ndoubtless tended to promote his professional success. He enjoyed the\r\nreputation of being an industrious and painstaking lawyer, and a\r\nbrilliant and accomplished member of society.\r\n\r\nIn 1823, when he had reached the age of thirty-one years, he was applied\r\nto for professional advice by the Earl of Strathmore. This event was\r\ndestined to have important consequences. The advice led to important\r\nprofessional employment extending over several months, during which the\r\nclever lawyer was a frequent guest in the Earl's household, and on terms\r\nof intimate social intercourse with the family. In an unhappy hour for\r\nhis future peace of mind he formed an attachment to Lady Mary Isabella\r\nBowes Lyon Willis, one of his lordship's daughters. His attachment was\r\nreciprocated by the young lady, who was possessed of great personal\r\nattractions, and who might doubtless have looked forward to a more\r\nambitious match; but her noble father had little to offer in the shape\r\nof dowry, and did not oppose her wishes. The marriage took place at\r\nMarylebone Church, in August, 1824. The bridegroom was then thirty-two\r\nyears of age, and the bride had just completed her twenty-second year.\r\nThis disparity was not sufficient to excite any remark, for Lady Mary\r\nwas mature for her age, and the bridegroom had scarcely taken leave of\r\nhis youth. For about three years after the marriage the pair resided\r\nwith Mr. Willis's mother, at Hendon, a pleasant suburb lying to the\r\nnorth-west of London; he meanwhile continuing the practice of his\r\nprofession in town. All these circumstances materially contributed to\r\nthe shaping of the young barrister's future career.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1827.]\r\n\r\nMr. Willis enjoyed the social advantages which his union with a\r\nnobleman's daughter was certain to confer. These advantages were fully\r\nappreciated, but they involved certain inevitable consequences, the\r\nprincipal of which was a material increase in the domestic expenditure.\r\nAs neither Lady Mary nor her husband was possessed of much property, and\r\nas the latter's income was almost entirely derived from his profession,\r\nhe resolved to try for some public appointment whereby his pecuniary\r\ncondition might be improved. Early in 1827 the project of establishing a\r\nCourt of Equity in Upper Canada was for a short time under some sort of\r\nconsideration at the Colonial Office. Through the influence of his\r\nfather-in-law, Mr. Willis was mentioned as a most suitable man to\r\nundertake that important duty. His heart responded to the idea. He felt\r\nthat he was well fitted for such a responsibility, and that a congenial\r\nsphere of usefulness would thus be presented to him. His vanity also\r\nseems to have been flattered by the prospect of being raised to the\r\nbench--even the colonial bench--at so early an age. Visions of social\r\nand intellectual supremacy among the magnates of Upper Canada doubtless\r\npresented themselves in alluring shapes before his mind. He had no\r\ndifficulty in obtaining a promise that in the event of the contemplated\r\nappointment being made it should be offered to him. The project,\r\nhowever, was still in embryo, and--as the event proved--was not fully\r\ncarried out until about ten years later. It was meanwhile desirable that\r\na puisne judge of the Court of King's Bench for Upper Canada should be\r\nappointed without delay, and that position was offered to Mr. Willis. It\r\nwas at the same time represented to him that his acceptance would in no\r\nwise interfere with the scheme of the establishment of a Court of\r\nChancery, and that he would be none the less fitted, to carry out such a\r\nscheme from his having resided for some time in the Province, and from\r\nhis having become to some extent familiar with local laws and\r\ninstitutions. After mature reflection he accepted the offer, and set\r\nout for Canada towards the end of the summer, accompanied by his wife,\r\nmother, sister and infant son.\r\n\r\nHis marriage had not proved in all respects a felicitous one. Lady Mary\r\nwas imbued with patrician ideas, and bore herself towards her husband's\r\nfamily with considerable hauteur. She was very particular in exacting\r\ncertain observances in which she considered herself entitled. There were\r\ndoubtless faults on both sides. Mrs. and Miss Willis took umbrage at the\r\npatronizing airs of Lady Mary, who, in her turn, complained that she was\r\nmade a cipher in her own house. There were also petty jealousies on the\r\npart of Lady Mary, which led to disputes between herself and her\r\nhusband. Altogether the domestic establishment at Hendon was not a\r\nharmonious one, but the means of the family were insufficient to admit\r\nof the keeping up of two separate households. The true remedy for such a\r\nstate of things lay in the exercise of a spirit of mutual\r\nforbearance--an exercise to which Lady Mary, at least, seems to have\r\nbeen little accustomed. Under such ominous auspices was the Willis\r\nhousehold transferred from Hendon to Upper Canada.\r\n\r\nThe Willises reached the Upper Province on the 17th of September, and on\r\nthe following day the new judge proceeded to Stamford Cottage, the\r\nsummer residence of the Lieutenant-Governor, in the Niagara District.\r\nHaving presented the royal warrant for his appointment, together with\r\ncertain other documents, he was cordially received by Sir Peregrine. He\r\ndined and spent the evening at the Cottage. In the course of\r\nconversation he referred to the project of establishing a Court of\r\nEquity--which by this time was no secret--and was surprised to find that\r\nthe theme was distasteful to his host, who, in a tone not to be\r\nmisunderstood, remarked: \"Sir, you have not got your Court of Equity\r\nyet.\" \"The words,\" wrote Mr. Willis,[96] \"made some impression at the\r\ntime, and subsequent events tended to throw further light upon their\r\nmeaning.\"\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at York, on the 20th, Mr. Willis was welcomed with\r\napparent cordiality by the judiciary, the bar, and society generally.\r\nThe leaders of local fashion vied with each other in their attentions\r\nto the ladies of the family, more especially to Lady Mary, who was\r\nalmost overwhelmed with civilities. The new judge was sworn in on the\r\n11th of October. He entered with avidity upon the duties of his office,\r\nand also made himself conspicuous in society, where he was from the\r\nfirst regarded in the light of a decided acquisition. He entered with\r\nkeen zest into plans for party-giving and entertaining, and evidently\r\nderived heartfelt pleasure from receiving and dispensing courteous\r\nhospitalities. He attended several public meetings which had been called\r\nfor charitable and other purposes, at all of which he spoke with what\r\nwas considered a somewhat perfervid eloquence. In a word, he not only\r\ntook the rank to which he was entitled by virtue of his office, but\r\njumped at once into the position of a leader of society and social\r\nmovements. His name was on everybody's lips. Persons to the manner born,\r\nwho had been accustomed to fill the foremost places in the public eye,\r\nfound themselves, for the time, almost superseded and ignored. Judge\r\nWillis duly appreciated the homage which was rendered to him, and\r\nexhibited himself to society in his brightest and most amiable colours.\r\nTo a few great personages, however, it seemed as if the new-comer\r\ncarried himself with wonderful _sang-froid_, and contemplated himself\r\nand his position with too much complacency. To them it appeared as if he\r\nregarded all the eager admiration which was lavished upon him as being\r\nnothing more than his transcendent qualifications entitled him to look\r\nfor at the hands of the little world of York. He seemed, they thought,\r\nto accept it all as his just due. And the belief was not unreasonable on\r\ntheir part, for the Judge seems to have been in a measure carried off\r\nhis feet by the attentions paid to him on every hand. His position was\r\none calling for the exercise of calm judgment and discretion. It was not\r\nsurprising that leading members of the bench and bar, who had long\r\nserved the Government with zeal and acceptance, should entertain some\r\njealousy at the appointment of an outsider to a place of high honour and\r\nemolument. Attorney-General Robinson, for instance, had filled his\r\nresponsible office for many years, and the Crown had certainly no reason\r\nto complain that he had favoured liberty at the expense of prerogative.\r\nHagerman and Boulton, too, had for years lent themselves to the purposes\r\nof the Executive. It was not singular that these persons should feel as\r\nthough their own claims to preferment had been passed over in favour of\r\nJudge Willis, a stranger to Canada, her institutions and her polity. Nor\r\nwas it wonderful that their deportment towards the stranger should, in\r\nspite of themselves, be influenced by the feeling. Judge Willie was not\r\nlong in discovering that some sentiment of this sort was in the air, but\r\nhe does not appear to have made sufficient allowance for it, and\r\nmanifested a disposition to carry things with a high hand. He\r\nentertained a poor opinion of the Attorney-General's professional\r\nattainments, and did not sufficiently conceal this opinion. He was at\r\nfirst disposed to think highly of Judge Sherwood's abilities, but erelong\r\ncame to the conclusion that he had greatly overestimated them,[97] and\r\nplainly showed, by his conduct, that he attached little weight to his\r\nbrother judge's decisions. This course was the very opposite to what\r\nwould have been adopted by a discreet and really able man. Such a man\r\nwould have made due allowance for jealousies which, under the\r\ncircumstances, were almost inevitable. Such a man would have adopted a\r\npolicy of friendly conciliation. Such a man would have refrained from\r\nmaking himself specially conspicuous, at least until he had been some\r\ntime settled in his new career, and had become accustomed to the novel\r\natmosphere. Judge Willis's conduct was the very reverse of all this. In\r\nhis intercourse with his brother judges--one of whom, it must be\r\nremembered, was Chief Justice--he adopted a tone of superiority, and\r\neven, to some extent, of dictation. He was of course not to be blamed\r\nfor dissenting from their opinions--which he very frequently\r\ndid--provided that he was honest in his dissent; but he acted very\r\ncavalierly on such occasions, and in pronouncing his own judgments\r\nseldom thought it necessary to make any reference to the decisions of\r\nhis brethren on the bench. It was impossible for the latter to ignore\r\nthe fact that he despised, or affected to despise their legal\r\nattainments; and their recognition of this necessarily gave rise to\r\nirritation and anger on their part. They felt his conduct to be all the\r\nmore disrespectful to them in consequence of his admitted want of\r\nfamiliarity with Common Law, his own reading and practice having been\r\nalmost exclusively confined to the Equity branch of the profession.\r\n\r\nIn the very first judgment ever rendered by him, he gave utterance to\r\nsentiments which, to put the matter mildly, were very much out of place.\r\nThe case was one brought by George Rolph, of Dundas, against T. G.\r\nSimons and others, for a gross outrage which had been perpetrated on the\r\nplaintiff, who was a brother of the Attorney-General's great political\r\nrival. The outrage had arisen out of private complications, and no\r\npolitical question arose in the course of the trial. In concluding his\r\njudgment Mr. Willis took occasion to remark that he had formed his\r\nopinion of the case on its intrinsic merits, unbiased by any political\r\nconsiderations. He added that he was totally devoid of party feelings,\r\nand that it would ever be his most earnest desire to render to every one\r\nimpartial justice. It goes without saying that these are very proper\r\nsentiments on the part of an occupant of the judicial bench. Such\r\nprinciples were especially required in Upper Canada, where there had\r\nlong been much judicial partiality and frequent miscarriages of justice\r\nby reason of political differences. But a judge should at least assume\r\nthat his integrity is taken for granted, and should deem it beneath his\r\ndignity to attempt any vindication of his rectitude while an occupant of\r\nthe bench. Moreover, there were no circumstances to call forth such\r\nexpressions as were used by Judge Willis. No hint of any partiality had\r\never been heard against him. There had been no opportunity for any\r\ndisplay of partiality by him, for he then took his seat on the bench for\r\nthe first time. Saith the proverb: \"He who makes unnecessary excuses\r\naccuses himself.\" In this case the Judge certainly indulged in wholly\r\nunnecessary self-vindication. And there were reasons why any such\r\nvindication by him was especially indelicate. The Radical newspapers had\r\nheralded his arrival as the dawn of a new era, when judicial corruption\r\nwould cease in the land. It is pretty evident that he had been flattered\r\nby the eulogy, and that he now went out of his way to administer a\r\ncovert reproof to his colleagues on the bench. His remarks were\r\nundoubtedly taken in that sense, and tacitly resented by them. It may\r\nhave been that they were all the more ready to take the remarks as\r\napplying to themselves from their consciousness of past shortcomings;\r\nbut it was not from a brother on the bench--one, too, who had been only\r\na few weeks in the country--that they should have been subjected to\r\nreproof.\r\n\r\nTo the feelings of his colleagues, however, Mr. Willis paid little\r\nconsideration. His heart was specially set upon the establishment of a\r\ncourt of equitable jurisdiction, and to this end he bent much of his\r\nenergy. He forced the matter upon the attention of the Attorney-General,\r\nwho, he found, differed from him in respect of certain important\r\ndetails. He also prepared and submitted a scheme to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor. He found great difficulty in inducing any member of\r\nthe Government to discuss the matter with him. He was informed that an\r\nAct of the Provincial Legislature was considered necessary to the\r\ncreation of such a court as the one contemplated by him. In this opinion\r\nhe did not coincide, but by way of expediting matters he bestirred\r\nhimself with a view to bringing about the necessary legislation. After a\r\nBill, originally prepared by his own hand, had been introduced into the\r\nAssembly, he attended to hear the debates, and fraternized with Rolph,\r\nBidwell, and other members of the Opposition--a circumstance which was\r\nafterwards very strongly urged against him at the Colonial Office. The\r\nBill did not run smoothly, and was denuded of certain clauses which he\r\ndeemed to be essential to the successful carrying out of the scheme. He\r\nvainly endeavoured to bring the Attorney-General round to his view of\r\nthe matter. Mr. Robinson had too long been supreme in all legal affairs\r\nto submit to any dictation, more especially from one towards whom he\r\nbore no good will. Judge Willis found himself opposed and thwarted at\r\nevery turn; and he erelong discovered that the Government were averse to\r\nthe scheme, although the aversion was not directly avowed. He then\r\nrecalled the Lieutenant-Governor's remark on the subject made to him\r\nsome months before at Stamford Cottage. Certain dubious expressions\r\nwhich had from time to time fallen from the lips of the\r\nAttorney-General, the Solicitor-General, the Judges, and other prominent\r\nofficials also recurred to his mind. As for Attorney-General Robinson,\r\n\"I at length discovered,\" wrote Judge Willis, \"that any proposition that\r\ndid not originate with himself was not generally attended with his\r\napprobation.\"[98]\r\n\r\nA despatch from the Colonial Secretary to the Lieutenant-Governor was\r\npromulgated about this time, from which it appeared that the project of\r\nestablishing a Court of equitable jurisdiction was in abeyance, or had,\r\nfor the time, been abandoned. Judge Willis was greatly disappointed at\r\nthis abandonment, which, in conversation, he openly ascribed to the\r\ninfluence of Sir James Scarlett, the English Attorney-General, with whom\r\nhe had once had some unpleasantness while on circuit. But it also became\r\nknown about the same time that Chief Justice Campbell was about to\r\nretire from the bench, and that his office would accordingly soon be\r\nvacant. Judge Willis lost no time in making application for the post.\r\nNeither did Attorney-General Robinson, whose application was backed by\r\nthe entire influence of the Upper Canadian Executive. Here was a fresh\r\nground of rivalry, whereby the unpleasant relations between these two\r\nofficials were intensified. It soon became impossible for the new Judge\r\nand the Attorney General to come into contact without feelings and\r\nexpressions indicative of personal hostility. The hollow friendship\r\nwhich had at first seemed to subsist between them was cast to the winds,\r\nand all social intercourse between them was at an end. Any proposition\r\nemanating from Judge Willis was systematically opposed by the\r\nAttorney-General. The Judge in his turn availed himself of several\r\nopportunities of showing how little weight he attached to the\r\nAttorney-General's opinions. Worse still, he brought upon himself the\r\nlasting indignation of the Lieutenant-Governor. It would perhaps be more\r\ncorrect to say that his wife brought this calamity upon him, for the\r\norigin of the trouble was a hot dispute between Lady Mary Willis and\r\nLady Sarah Maitland on a question of rank and precedence. In this\r\nquarrel it is quite clear that Lady Mary was in the wrong, but the whole\r\naffair was utterly contemptible on both sides. The ladies dragged their\r\nrespective liege-lords into the dispute, and each of the latter espoused\r\nthe side of his helpmeet. Sir Peregrine necessarily got the better of\r\nhis adversary, whom he never forgave. It is impossible to say how far\r\nthis unseemly women's wrangle contributed to the humiliation which Judge\r\nWillis was subsequently compelled to endure, but it is pretty clear that\r\nfrom that time forward Sir Peregrine was bent upon getting his adversary\r\nremoved from his position. Unhappily the Judge, by his want of\r\ndiscretion, made this resolution comparatively easy of accomplishment.\r\nHe constituted himself a sort of general censor of judicial and official\r\nshortcomings, and from his seat on the bench gave utterance to petulant\r\nand unbecoming strictures on various transactions with which he had no\r\nneed to concern himself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828.]\r\n\r\nAt the York Assizes held in April, 1828, Judge Willis came into such\r\nserious public collision with the Attorney-General that the affair was\r\nbruited abroad, and made considerable noise throughout the Province. On\r\nThursday, the 10th of the month, Francis Collins, editor of the\r\n_Freeman_, was brought up on certain indictments for libel preferred\r\nagainst him by Attorney-General Robinson, under circumstances which will\r\nbe detailed in a subsequent chapter. The bench was occupied by Mr.\r\nJustice Sherwood. The Clerk was just about to proceed to arraign the\r\naccused, when a postponement was asked for on the latter's behalf. The\r\napplication was granted, and there the matter ended for the day. Next\r\nmorning--Friday, the 11th--the bench was occupied by Justice Willis, who\r\nthen for the first time in his life presided at an Assize. He had no\r\nsooner taken his seat than Collins rose at the bar. \"May it please your\r\nLordship,\" said he, \"I have a motion or two to make in Court, if I, not\r\nbeing a lawyer, am in order in so doing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied the Judge; \"step forward, that the Court may hear\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nCollins then stepped forward, and addressed the Court in a speech which\r\nhad evidently been prepared for the occasion.[99] \"My Lord,\" said he, \"I\r\nam the humble conductor of a public press in this town. I come forward\r\nto accuse His Majesty's Attorney-General of vindictiveness and foul\r\npartiality in the discharge of his duty as prosecuting officer for the\r\nCrown. He has sent his nephews and apprentices as spies into my office\r\nin order to hunt up imaginary offences. He has preferred bills of\r\nindictment against me on supposition of libel, and I have been dragged\r\nfrom my business by a common constable, and obliged to give bail in this\r\nCourt, while he, the Attorney-General, has allowed the most infamous\r\ncrimes to pass in review before him, without taking any notice whatever\r\nof them.\" And so on, with much more to the same purport.\r\n\r\nThe speaker was interrupted by the Attorney-General, who had been\r\nconferring with a member of the bar in an adjoining room, but who had\r\nbeen specially summoned into Court by his clerk, Henry Sherwood, who had\r\ninformed him that Collins was making a long harangue to the Judge.\r\nObserving that the Judge showed no disposition to put a stop to the\r\nproceedings, Mr. Robinson requested to be informed what was the\r\ndefendant's object in addressing the Court, and whether he had made any\r\nmotion. \"If Mr. Collins is allowed to proceed,\" replied Judge Willis, \"I\r\ndare say his object will appear.\" Collins accordingly proceeded:--\r\n\r\n\"My Lord, while I have been dragged into this Court, on the mere\r\nsuspicion of libel, by His Majesty's Attorney-General, I hold in my hand\r\nthe printed confession of His Majesty's Solicitor-General, Henry John\r\nBoulton Esquire, of a crime that the law of England calls murder,\r\ncommitted ten or eleven years ago.[100] Yet no indictment has been\r\nbrought against him, and this confession is attested by James Fitz\r\nGibbon Esquire, a magistrate of this District, and by the Sheriff of\r\nthis Court. I hold also in my hand the printed history of an outrage of\r\nthe grossest character, where a number of young official gentlemen in\r\nthis town assembled together and committed a noonday burglary, by\r\nbreaking into the private house of William Lyon Mackenzie, and\r\ndestroying his property. This atrocious outrage, please your Lordship,\r\nwas proved on the floor of this Court, in the presence of His Majesty's\r\nAttorney-General. The perpetrators were identified and sworn to, yet no\r\nindictment has ever been brought against them, while the\r\nAttorney-General is busying himself in sending spies and informers into\r\nmy printing office to bring me up for imaginary offences.\"\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General could hardly be expected to sit quietly under such\r\naccusations as these, made in open Court, and listened to by the bench\r\nwithout any expression of disapprobation. He rose in some heat, and\r\nremarked that he hoped the Court would not allow the public business to\r\nbe thus interrupted. \"The defendant,\" said he, \"is not upon his trial,\r\nnor has he ever been arraigned. He seems merely to be indulging himself\r\nin an attack upon me as Attorney-General--an attack which could not have\r\nany bearing upon his own case, even if it were now before a jury; but\r\nwhich at present is nothing but a most improper interruption of the\r\nbusiness of the Court, by an harangue intended to prejudice the public\r\nmind before he shall be put upon his trial. As to the matters of which\r\nhe has spoken, I am not to be called to account by him, or by any other\r\ndefendant, for the discharge of my official duties with respect to other\r\nparties not now before the Court. I am at all times ready to account for\r\nmy proceedings as Attorney-General to the Government for whom I act, and\r\nto whom I am responsible; but I trust that the Court will not suffer a\r\nperson whom I merely know as defendant upon bills for libels of the most\r\ndisgraceful kind, and whose arraignment upon these charges has been\r\npostponed, as an indulgence, at his own request--I trust that such a\r\nperson will not be allowed to address the Court in this irregular\r\nmanner, for the mere object of calumniating me, whose duty it is to\r\nconduct the prosecutions against him.\"\r\n\r\nA brief silence followed these words, after which Collins resumed, and\r\nwas allowed to proceed without further interruption.\r\n\r\n\"The object of my present motion, then, my Lord, is to compel the\r\nAttorney-General to do that duty which he has so long neglected when his\r\nown friends were concerned; and as I think his present proceedings\r\nagainst me are both partial and unjust, I shall press the criminal\r\nprosecution of his friends, Henry John Boulton Esquire, for murder, and\r\nSamuel P. Jarvis and others for riot. In the latter case, please your\r\nLordship, the rioters were sued in a civil action, and damages to a\r\nconsiderable amount recovered from them; yet I feel it my duty to press\r\nthe criminal prosecution, because James Fitz Gibbon Esquire, a\r\nmagistrate of this District, begged the amount of the fine from door to\r\ndoor in this town, and the rioters have so far gone wholly unpunished.\r\nAll I ask, please your Lordship, is justice and impartiality, and from\r\nyour Lordship's character I doubt not I shall receive them at your\r\nhands.\"\r\n\r\nAfter a moment's consideration, during which silence reigned supreme in\r\nthe Court-room, Judge Willis remarked:--\"If the Attorney-General has\r\nacted as you say, he has very much neglected his duty. Go you before the\r\nGrand Jury, and if you meet with any obstruction or difficulty I will\r\nsee that the Attorney-General affords you every facility.\"\r\n\r\nThis was, beyond doubt, very unbecoming language to be used by a Judge\r\nunder such circumstances. It must be understood that Judge Willis had\r\nnot properly before him any facts upon which to base his opinion as to\r\nthe Attorney-General's having neglected his duty. That that official had\r\nmuch to answer for; that his practice had been one-sided and\r\ninconsistent; that much of his life had been spent in endeavouring to\r\nsmother public opinion and to maintain the supremacy of a selfish and\r\ncorrupt caste--this must be conceded at the bar of history. But no such\r\nallegations were before Judge Willis in an official form, and he had no\r\nright to assume anything against the Attorney-General in the absence of\r\nthe most irrefragable evidence. Instead of evidence, he had merely heard\r\nthe _ex parte_ statements of an alleged libeller. This was the legal\r\naspect of the matter, and it is impossible to avoid the conclusion that\r\nthe Judge permitted himself to be influenced, by his personal dislike to\r\nAttorney-General Robinson.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General sat for a moment as if thunderstruck. He had so\r\nlong been accustomed to having his own way in Courts of Justice, and to\r\nseeing his opinions deferred to by the bench, that he could scarcely\r\ncredit what was passing before his eyes. That a Judge should dare to\r\ncensure him in this irregular way, before the bar and the public, was\r\nalmost beyond belief. A contemporary account says that he turned to \"a\r\nrich cream colour.\"[101] He was at all events labouring under suppressed\r\nrage as he deliberately arose to address the Court. He denied that he\r\nhad neglected his duty in not preferring indictments against persons in\r\ncases where no formal complaint had been laid, and he utterly repudiated\r\nthe idea that his office imposed upon him the _role_ of a thief-catcher.\r\n\"It is not my business,\" said he, \"to play the part of a detective, or\r\nto hunt about the country for evidence in support of voluntary\r\nprosecutions. I have now discharged the duties of a Crown officer for\r\nnearly thirteen years, and this is the first time that a failure in my\r\nduty has been imputed to me. I have always conceived it to be my duty to\r\ntake official cognizance of offences against the State. As to other\r\ncases, I have been accustomed to proceed only upon informations and\r\ncomplaints placed in my hands by justices of the peace, and upon\r\npresentments of Grand Juries. In cases of injuries to individuals and\r\ntheir properties, such as assaults and riots, where a double remedy is\r\nafforded by action and indictment, I have not been accustomed to set the\r\nlaw in operation on my own motion.\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" interrupted Judge Willis, \"merely proves that your practice has\r\nbeen uniformly wrong, and I take leave to remark that you have neglected\r\nyour duty. Why are you placed here, as prosecuting officer? To prevent\r\nthe violation of the public peace, or, when it has been violated, to\r\npunish the offenders, whoever they may be, or whatever may be your\r\nprivate feelings with respect to them. The moment a violation of the\r\npublic peace was proved before you, as in the case mentioned by Mr.\r\nCollins, it was your duty to proceed against the offenders. Do you not\r\nconsider that the Solicitor-General and yourself have the exclusive\r\nright to conduct all criminal prosecutions; or do you admit them to be\r\nopen to the bar in general, as in England?\"\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General's feelings were by this time worked up to a\r\ntremendous pitch of excitement. To think that a Judge--a junior Judge,\r\nwho had been only a few months in the country--should presume to lecture\r\nhim in this manner, and to instruct him in his duties as though he were\r\na petty juryman! \"My Lord,\" he burst forth, in a tone of hot anger, \"I\r\nknow my duty as well as any Judge on the bench. I have always acted in\r\nthe way I have indicated, in which respect I have followed the practice\r\nof all my predecessors in this Province; and I shall continue to act in\r\nthe same manner as long as I am prosecuting officer for the Crown.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, Sir,\" retorted Judge Willis, \"if you know your duty you have\r\nwilfully neglected it; and as you say you will continue to act as you\r\nhave done hitherto, I shall feel it to be my duty--holding, as I do,\r\nHis Majesty's commission on this bench--to make a representation of\r\nyour conduct to His Majesty's Government.\"\r\n\r\nThis far from edifying scene was without precedent in the annals of\r\nUpper Canadian courts of justice, and was for some days the talk of the\r\ntown, more especially among the members of the legal profession. The bar\r\ngenerally sided with the Attorney-General, and were loud in their\r\naspersions upon Judge Willis. Some of the leading members, however,\r\namong whom were Rolph, Bidwell and the two Baldwins, took a different\r\nview, so far, at least, as the legal aspect of the dispute was\r\nconcerned. As for public opinion generally, it was largely in favour of\r\nJudge Willis. On Monday, the 14th, before the public pulse had had time\r\nto cool, there was a scarcely less notable interchange of asperities\r\nbetween the same personages. The Attorney-General, in a criminal case in\r\nwhich he was officially concerned, took occasion to reiterate, in\r\neffect, the views to which he had given expression on the previous\r\nThursday as to the duties of a Crown prosecutor. When he had finished\r\nhis remarks Judge Willis expressed himself to the same effect as before.\r\n\"The practice in this country,\" said the Judge, \"as stated by the\r\nAttorney-General, does not agree with my notions as to the duty of that\r\nofficer, and I have laid a statement of the question before His\r\nMajesty's Government here for the purpose of having it transmitted to\r\nEngland, where it will be decided how far the Attorney-General is right\r\nin expressing his sentiments as he has done.\" Mr. Robinson hereupon\r\nremarked that he was Attorney-General to His Majesty, and not to Judge\r\nWillis, and that he would act as he believed to be right, even though he\r\nshould differ in opinion from his Lordship.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WILLIS.--Mr. Attorney-General, I am one of His Majesty's Judges\r\nin this Province. As such, it is my place to state to the Crown officers\r\nwhat their duties are, and it is for them to perform those duties\r\naccording to direction. If the interests of the Crown had not been\r\nconcerned I would not have permitted any discussion on the question. But\r\nI am sure His Majesty's Government will protect me from insult in the\r\nexercise of my judicial functions, and in stating to any public officer\r\nwhat I conceive to be his duties.\r\n\r\nATTORNEY-GENERAL ROBINSON.--And will also protect His Majesty's officers\r\nin the execution of their duty.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WILLIS.--Mr. Attorney-General, I beg that you will not reply to\r\nthe bench in that manner.\r\n\r\nThe unseemliness of thus discussing, in open Court, how far the\r\nAttorney-General had proved to be an effective public servant, must be\r\napparent to everybody. And it must be admitted that the discussion was\r\nprovoked by Justice Willis, who had made something very like an attack\r\nupon the Attorney-General--an attack based upon the unsworn statements\r\nof an indicted libeller. He had moreover permitted Collins to go a most\r\nunwarrantable length in his onslaught upon the Crown prosecutor, more\r\nespecially as no affidavits had been produced in support of the motion.\r\nA layman who comes before the Courts _inops consilii_ is allowed more\r\nlatitude in the conduct of his case than is generally conceded to a\r\ncounsel whose professional business it is to plead at the bar; but the\r\nlatitude permitted in the case under consideration was beyond all\r\nlegitimate bounds. The Judge's dislike to the Attorney-General seems to\r\nhave predisposed him to believe that all Collins's allegations were\r\ntrue. In reality they were exaggerated presentations of notorious facts.\r\nThat they were largely founded upon facts Judge Willis probably knew\r\nfrom common hearsay. But while sitting on the bench he had nothing to do\r\nwith common hearsay. _A fortiori_, he was not justified, upon the mere\r\nassumption of a hypothetical case,[102] in admonishing the\r\nAttorney-General in the presence of his accuser, and in humiliating him\r\nin the presence of the bar of which he was the rightful head. An English\r\njudge would be considered as departing widely beyond the sphere of his\r\nduty if he were thus openly to arraign the conduct of the\r\nAttorney-General, especially in a matter clearly lying, as in the case\r\nunder consideration, within that officer's discretion. English judges,\r\non the contrary, are much more likely to interpose on behalf of the\r\nofficers of the Crown, and to prevent their acts and motives from being\r\ncalled in question in open Court by persons against whom proceedings\r\nhave been instituted by them. Judge Willis seems to have been wrong in\r\nhis law, wrong in his etiquette, wrong in his temper, and wrong in his\r\nconstruction of judicial amenities.\r\n\r\nHenceforth the Judge's \"amoval\" was only a matter of time, for the\r\nentire influence of the Executive, direct and indirect, was arrayed\r\nagainst him. From the Lieutenant-Governor down to the most insignificant\r\nclerk in the departments there arose a howl of indignation against the\r\nman who had dared to set up his wife in opposition to Lady Sarah\r\nMaitland; who had dissented from the judgments of Chief Justice Campbell\r\nand Mr. Sherwood, and sneered at their legal acumen; who consorted with\r\nthe leading members of the Opposition; who had even gone the\r\ninconceivable length of berating Attorney-General Robinson for\r\nneglecting his duty. Such a man was not to be tolerated. He must surely\r\nbe a Radical, who had got himself sent over to this colony in order that\r\nhe might stir up dissatisfaction among the people. To go over all the\r\ninterminable squabbles which took place between Judge Willis, on the one\r\nhand, and the various judicial and official dignitaries on the other,\r\nwould be alike wearisome and profitless. Judge Willis availed himself of\r\nevery opportunity which presented itself for officially and publicly\r\nanimadverting upon the conduct of those who were opposed to him. He\r\nadded to his enormities by announcing, through the newspapers, that he\r\nwas preparing for publication a work on Upper Canadian jurisprudence,\r\nand it appeared that the title-page was to bear the deprecatory motto\r\n_Meliora sperans_.[103] _Meliora sperans_, indeed! What manner of\r\npersonage was this outsider, who arrogated to himself the responsibility\r\nof ameliorating the rigours of Upper Canadian laws?[104] It was not long\r\nbefore an opposition announcement appeared, being an exact counterpart\r\nof the other, except that the motto was _Deteriora timens_. The\r\nauthorship of the latter, whether rightly or wrongly, was very generally\r\nattributed to Attorney-General Robinson. Judge Willis's announcement\r\ngave great offence to the official guardians of the law, from the\r\nhighest to the lowest. The motto, which in reality had been adopted by\r\nhim prior to his coming to Canada, was believed to have been specially\r\nassumed for the occasion, and was regarded as a covert sneer at existing\r\ninstitutions in the Province. As a consequence, it was taken as\r\nadditional evidence of disrespect. Owing to the Judge's \"amoval\" the\r\nprojected treatise was never issued, though several chapters of it had\r\nactually been written. A small portion of it was incorporated in a work\r\npublished by the author in England twenty-two years afterwards.[105]\r\n\r\nIn an elaborately-worded despatch to the Colonial Secretary, dated the\r\n6th of June, 1828, Sir Peregrine Maitland called the attention of that\r\nofficial to Judge Willis's announcement and the accompanying motto,\r\nwhich he declared to be, in his opinion, neither discreet nor delicate,\r\nas emanating from a Judge upon the bench, who had been but a few months\r\nin the Province. The laws of Upper Canada, in Sir Peregrine's\r\nestimation, were highly satisfactory, and needed nothing so much as to\r\nbe let alone. \"I have been ten years in this government,\" he wrote, \"and\r\nas I have never received any representation against the laws, or the\r\nmanner in which they have been administered, I must conclude that the\r\npeople are content with both.\" Content with laws which prescribed\r\ncapital punishment for the killing of a cow! Content with laws which had\r\nbeen conceived in an iron age, and under a state of society which was\r\nnow happily passing away! Content with the laws! When a majority of the\r\npopulation, through their representatives in the Assembly, had for years\r\nbeen using their utmost endeavours to procure the repeal of the Sedition\r\nAct of 1804! When a Select Committee of the British House of Commons had\r\ndirected the attention of Government to this mediaevally-conceived\r\nstatute, and had expressly recommended its repeal! Content with the\r\nmanner in which the laws had been administered, when the trial of Robert\r\nGourlay was yet fresh in the public memory! When a score of almost\r\nequally vile but less conspicuous perversions of justice were matters of\r\nyesterday! When no obscure litigant could sue a member of the Family\r\nCompact with any assurance of obtaining his rights! When the Reform\r\nnewspapers had for years been filled to overflowing with complaints\r\nabout the imperfect administration of justice! When a very\r\nstrongly-worded complaint of neglect in the administration of justice\r\nhad only a few weeks before been made in open court to Judge Willis when\r\nhe first took his seat in a Court of Assize! When a large proportion of\r\nthe population had ceased to have any confidence in the integrity of the\r\njudiciary! When this want of confidence was shared by several leaders of\r\nthe Provincial bar, who certainly had exceptional opportunities for\r\nforming a correct opinion on the subject! The time was not far distant\r\nwhen one of the most eminent and successful lawyers in the country was\r\nto abandon his profession, owing to this very want of confidence. Truly,\r\na wonderful manifestation of content with the laws and the manner in\r\nwhich they were administered. Sir Peregrine thought and acted as other\r\nopponents of reform have acted from time immemorial. He refused to\r\nbelieve in the existence of discontent which he did not share. He\r\nrefused to believe that he himself was not an object of adoration to the\r\ngreat body of the people, because the official lickspittles by whom he\r\nwas surrounded vied with each other in flattering his imbecile vanity.\r\nHad he been left to his own devices he would have been like the doomed\r\nking who refused to believe that his people were hungry until thirty\r\nthousand starving _sans-culottes_ were thundering at his palace gates.\r\n\r\nIt soon became generally known throughout the country that strained\r\nrelations existed between Judge Willis and the whole race of officialdom\r\nat the capital. The new Judge was known to have given expression to a\r\ndesire for a reform of the law; and it was commonly assumed that it was\r\nto his liberal ideas that he was indebted for the hostility with which\r\nhe was regarded by the ruling faction. The Reform Party warmly espoused\r\nhis cause, and their organs devoted much space to extolling his wisdom,\r\nmoderation and other high qualities. Addresses to him were circulated\r\nthroughout some of the rural constituencies, and there was a manifest\r\ndisposition to cater for his favour and patronage. Had he been endowed\r\nwith discretion and good judgment he might, without any dereliction from\r\nhis judicial duty or integrity, have rendered incalculable service to\r\nthe cause of freedom and good government. Doubtless the rendering of\r\nsuch service would sooner or later have involved him in complications\r\nwith the official party, but if he had kept his head it is doubtful if\r\nthey could have prevailed against him. Unfortunately he proved to be too\r\nweak for his position, and allowed himself to be completely\r\nout-manoeuvred. He ruined himself, without accomplishing anything for\r\nthe cause which he wished to serve. The time was rapidly drawing near\r\nwhen, by means of a judicial decision, he was to shut the door forever\r\nupon any prospect of his advancement in this country, and when he was to\r\nbe made the subject of official communications resulting in his\r\npermanent removal therefrom.\r\n\r\nAs has already been mentioned, there had been frequent differences of\r\nopinion between Mr. Willis and his colleagues, almost from the beginning\r\nof the former's assumption of judicial functions. The acting justices of\r\nthe Court of King's Bench were at that time three in number, and\r\nconsisted of the Hon. William Campbell, Chief Justice, the Hon. Levius\r\nPeters Sherwood, senior puisne judge, and Mr. Justice Willis himself.\r\nDuring the first Term which ensued after Mr. Willis's arrival in this\r\ncountry--which was Michaelmas Term, 1827--he had occupied the bench\r\nalong with the other two judges. In Hilary Term of 1828 the Court had\r\nbeen presided over by the same three judges, except that Chief Justice\r\nCampbell had occasionally been absent from his seat in consequence of\r\ninfirm health. Immediately after the close of the last-named Term the\r\nChief Justice, having obtained from the Lieutenant-Governor six months'\r\nleave of absence, departed for England, whence he did not return until\r\nafter a long holiday. The Court of King's Bench was thus left with only\r\nthe two puisne judges, who accordingly presided by themselves during the\r\nfollowing Easter Term. They had by this time come to dislike each other\r\nmost cordially, insomuch that it taxed their powers to the utmost to\r\ntreat each other with becoming respect. Sometimes the effort was beyond\r\ntheir power, and they snapped and snarled at one another upon the bench\r\nlike two querulous old women. They now differed in opinion upon almost\r\nevery case which came before them, and it is impossible to doubt that\r\ntheir differences were in large measure due to their personal hostility.\r\nThis was a serious matter, for, as no third judge was at hand to give\r\nthe preponderance of authority to either side, there was a practical\r\ndead-lock in much of the business of the Court. Suitors were put to\r\nserious delay, inconvenience, and consequent expense. Counsel were\r\nprofoundly disgusted, and of course took sides for and against. Judge\r\nWillis was so sensible of the deplorable consequences of such a state of\r\nthings that, as soon as Term was over, he entered into a minute and\r\nsearching investigation of the constitution and power of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench as established in Upper Canada.[106] He was desirous of\r\nfinding some way out of the difficulty, or at all events of knowing\r\nprecisely upon what ground he stood. But a still more serious evil soon\r\nbegan to loom up before his mind, for the result of his investigations\r\nwas a conviction that the Court could not legally sit in Term, unless\r\nthe full court--_i.e._, the Chief Justice and the two puisne\r\nJustices--were present.\r\n\r\nThis conviction was a momentous one, for, if sustained, it would nullify\r\nmuch that had been done in the Court ever since its establishment in\r\n1794. The frequent practice had been for two Judges, and sometimes even\r\nfor only one, to sit during Term; and, as has been seen, Judge Willis\r\nhimself had so far acquiesced in this practice as to sit during a part\r\nof the preceding Hilary Term, and during the whole of Easter Term, with\r\nJustice Sherwood as his only colleague. He had however assumed the\r\nprevailing practice to be justified by the constitution of the Court,\r\nand had not examined the matter on his own account until impelled to do\r\nso by the reasons already indicated. He now discovered, as he believed,\r\nthat the practice was altogether unwarranted, and that all that had been\r\ndone under it was liable to be upset. The first section of the\r\nProvincial Statute under which the Court had been created[107] enacted\r\nthat \"His Majesty's Chief Justice, together with two puisne justices,\"\r\nshould preside therein. All the subsequent sections except those\r\nrelating to appeals had been repealed by a later Provincial Act,[108]\r\nand although power was given to the senior puisne Judge, in the absence\r\nof the Chief Justice, to _teste_ the process, and to _any_ of the Judges\r\nto sit at _Nisi Prius_, there was no authority to sit _in Banco_,\r\nunless the Court were full. Having arrived at a conclusion on the\r\nsubject, Judge Willis at once communicated the fact to the Colonial\r\nSecretary, the communication being made by letter, forwarded through the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, and left purposely unsealed in order that that\r\ndignitary might possess himself of the contents, to which his attention\r\nwas specially called by a separate note. Sir Peregrine could not refuse\r\nto transmit the Judge's missive, but he took good care to malign him in\r\nan accompanying despatch. \"It is with pain\" he wrote, \"I am compelled to\r\nobserve that, having presided as a Judge for the first two terms after\r\nhis arrival, without finding more occasion than all the respectable\r\nJudges who have preceded him to make the administration of justice\r\nsubservient to popular excitement, Mr. Willis has been either unable or\r\nunwilling within the last few months to avoid making his proceedings,\r\neither in the Civil or Criminal Court, the prominent subject of\r\npolitical discussion, and the pretence of attacks _from the vilest\r\nquarters_, and of the grossest kind, upon those who were associated with\r\nhim in the administration of justice, and of whom I shall speak only\r\njustly when I say that the measure of respect and esteem in which their\r\npublic conduct has ever hitherto been held, and is now held, by their\r\nGovernment, and by every person except by Mr. Willis, and by a party\r\nwith whom I have lamented to find him associate himself, and _who are\r\nnot very respectable in any sense_, is not to be attained but by a long\r\nperiod of correct and honourable service.\" The italics are not Sir\r\nPeregrine's, but they are deserving of all the emphasis which\r\ndistinguishing type can give them, as exemplifying the way in which the\r\nrepresentative of Majesty in those days was not ashamed to secretly\r\nvilify persons who opposed his policy: persons who, whether contemplated\r\nfrom a moral or an intellectual point of view, were elevated so far\r\nabove him that it is impossible to institute any comparison between\r\nthem. Will it be believed that the gentlemen who were \"not very\r\nrespectable in any sense\" were John Rolph, Marshall Spring Bidwell, Dr.\r\nWilliam Warren Baldwin, and Robert Baldwin? Was it not an honour to be\r\ndisreputable in such company? Some of these, at least, were men whom no\r\npressure of outward circumstances could have induced to stab their\r\nbitterest foe in the dark, as this eminently respectable vice-regal\r\nassassin was in the frequent habit of doing in his despatches, and as\r\nhe did when he wrote the mendacious words above quoted. Judge Willis\r\ndoubtless associated with these men because he found them more to his\r\ntaste than anyone else with whom he became acquainted in York. And his\r\ndoing so was made much more of than the facts warranted. His\r\nacquaintance with the persons named was not of such a nature as to be\r\ncalled intimate. In his \"Narrative,\" already quoted from, he has\r\nrecorded that to the best of his recollection he never conversed with\r\nDr. Baldwin, Mr. Rolph, Mr. Bidwell, \"or any other person politically\r\nopposed to Mr. Robinson\" a dozen times in the course of his life; and in\r\na separate defence of his conduct written at Bath in December, 1828, he\r\nsays: \"From what I know of Dr. Baldwin and his family, I must always\r\nsincerely regret that I have not known more.\"[109]\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at such a decision as to the constitution of the Court,\r\nand having apprised the Colonial Secretary thereof, he took the earliest\r\nfeasible opportunity of making it known to the Provincial bar. At ten\r\no'clock in the forenoon of the opening day of Trinity Term--which was\r\nMonday, the 16th of June--he repaired to the Court House at York. While\r\nrobing himself in the Judge's chamber he was joined by his colleague,\r\nJustice Sherwood, and a few moments afterward they both proceeded to the\r\nCourt room, attended by the Sheriff in the usual manner. The Court\r\nhaving been formally opened, Judge Willis arose and addressed the\r\naudience, standing all the while, after the manner of a counsel at the\r\nbar. In the course of his remarks, which occupied nearly an hour in\r\ndelivery, he expressed himself in very positive terms as to the\r\nconstitution of the Court. He declared it to be his decided opinion that\r\nthe Court could not be legally held without the presence of the Chief\r\nJustice and two puisne Judges; that everything which had theretofore\r\nbeen done in the Court by two Judges only was null and void; that the\r\nLieutenant-Governor had no authority to grant leave of absence to a\r\nJudge without the express approbation of the Executive Council; that he\r\n(Judge Willis) had made enquiry at the office of the Executive Council,\r\nand had found that leave had always been granted by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor alone, in pursuance of which leave Chief Justice\r\nCampbell was now absent from the Province. The manner in which the leave\r\nof absence to the Chief Justice, as well as to many other persons\r\nholding situations under the Provincial Government, had been granted by\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, was pronounced to be, in Judge Willis's\r\nopinion, not only irregular but illegal, whereby the incumbents had\r\nforfeited their several offices. During the preceding Term an order of\r\nthe Court had been passed by Judge Sherwood and himself. That order he\r\nnow rescinded, so far as his authority was concerned, and he expressed\r\nhis regret that he had entered upon the discharge of his judicial\r\nfunctions without having previously acquainted himself with the state of\r\nthe law. He added that he had felt it to be his imperative duty to\r\ndeclare his opinion as to the incapacity of the Court to legally proceed\r\nwith the business before it; and that, holding that opinion, he had\r\nresolved to decline to sit any longer upon the bench, though he would\r\nremain at hand to attend to any functions which he could legally\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary address, it may be presumed, was not altogether a\r\nsurprise to Justice Sherwood, as Justice Willis had previously notified\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor of his intention to give currency to his views\r\nat the commencement of Term, and Sir Peregrine would be certain to\r\ndiscuss the matter with the Attorney-General, through which medium the\r\nfacts would be tolerably sure to find their way to Justice Sherwood. The\r\nlatter seemed to take the matter very coolly. He informed the bar that\r\nhe would not take upon himself to pronounce an opinion on the subject of\r\nthe constitution of the Court, as there was nothing before him which\r\nrendered it necessary for him to do so. He added that he would adhere to\r\nthe practice which had uniformly prevailed, and that he would not\r\nhesitate to proceed with the ordinary business of the Court, adjourning\r\nit from day to day as occasion required. Judge Willis, still standing,\r\nthen said: \"You cannot adjourn a Court that does not exist. The Court is\r\nnot legally constituted. Its functions cannot be exercised, and any\r\nproceedings you may take will be void.\" \"I am aware,\" replied Mr.\r\nSherwood, \"that such is your opinion; but I have a right to mine and I\r\nshall pursue the course I have indicated. If that course,\r\nnotwithstanding the practice which has hitherto prevailed, should prove\r\nto be wrong, I shall extremely regret it; but I feel it to be a matter\r\nof too much importance to the business of the country to take upon\r\nmyself to vary from it, without the interference of a higher authority.\"\r\nJudge Willis then briefly repeated his protest, and retired from the\r\nbench. His colleague, after transacting some unimportant routine\r\nbusiness, adjourned the Court until the following day. Throughout the\r\nrest of the Term he was the sole occupant of the Bench.\r\n\r\nJudge Willis's conduct on this occasion does not admit of much diversity\r\nof opinion. For one thing, as was subsequently decided by the Privy\r\nCouncil, he was wrong in his view of the law. This is of itself an\r\nimportant consideration. But even if his view had been a sound one,\r\nadmitting of no doubt, he incurred a very serious responsibility in\r\ngiving currency to it at such a time, and in such a manner. His conduct\r\nwas certain to produce great excitement and disturbance in the public\r\nmind. It was certain to create an increased distrust of long-settled\r\ninstitutions, which it was highly essential for the well-being of\r\nsociety that the public should regard with confidence and respect.\r\nBesides, the rendering of the past and present proceedings of the Court\r\nliable to doubt and uncertainty could not fail to seriously affect the\r\nbusiness interests of the country. If the practice of the Court had been\r\nwrong, and if many of its proceedings were invalid, the wisest course\r\nwould have been to quietly take steps to bring about remedial\r\nlegislation, whereby all defects might have been cured, without the\r\nserious risk of reviving old animosities and long-settled disputes. But\r\nsuch a course as Judge Willis saw fit to adopt was wholly uncalled for,\r\nno plea to the jurisdiction having been pleaded in any case before the\r\nCourt. It was certain to produce ill, without any possibility of good.\r\nHe moreover placed in the hands of the Executive a rod for his own\r\nback--an implement of which they speedily availed themselves to inflict\r\ngrievous punishment.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, which was Thursday, the 17th, Judge Willis\r\nformally notified the Lieutenant-Governor of the public delivery of his\r\nopinion, adding that he was nevertheless most desirous of discharging\r\nsuch duties as he could legally perform consistently with his view of\r\nthe law. Judge Sherwood meanwhile continued to sit on the bench alone,\r\nand to transact such business as came before him. Some influential\r\nmembers of the bar found themselves in a quandary. After Judge Willis's\r\ndecision, they entertained grave doubts as to the legality of the Court,\r\nand hesitated as to the advisability of taking any further proceedings\r\nin cases committed to them, until the vexed question should be settled.\r\nJudge Sherwood, though he had dissented from his colleague's view, and\r\nthough he plainly testified by his persisting in sitting and holding\r\nCourt that he still continued to dissent, had not given any formal\r\njudgment, nor had he even verbally stated any grounds for his opinion.\r\nWith a view to obtaining light for their guidance in this perplexing\r\nemergency, Dr. Baldwin, his son Robert, and Mr. Simon Washburn, another\r\nprominent member of the bar, addressed a written application to the\r\nCourt, in the person of Justice Sherwood, requesting to be favoured with\r\nhis opinion on the matter. The application was made on Thursday, the\r\n17th, and replied to by Mr. Sherwood in writing next day. The\r\nphraseology of the reply made it quite clear that the Judge felt by no\r\nmeans strong in his position. \"You are desirous,\" he wrote, \"that I\r\nshould express an opinion from the bench on the present state of this\r\nCourt, but it appears to me any opinion of that sort would be\r\nextra-judicial. No one but His Majesty's Representative has any right to\r\nask for the opinion of a Judge where no cause or regular motion,\r\naccording to the practice of the Court, is pending before him.\" There\r\nwas more to the same no-purport. It was clear that the applicants were\r\nnot to receive much assistance from Justice Sherwood in resolving their\r\ndoubts. The Judge's response was no sooner communicated from the bench\r\nthan the two Baldwins and Mr Rolph then and there threw off their gowns\r\nand left the Court, declaring that they concurred in opinion with Judge\r\nWillis, and that they could not continue to transact business in a Court\r\nwhich they believed to illegally constituted.\r\n\r\nThe emergency brought about by Judge Willis's decision, and by his\r\nconsequent withdrawal from the bench, was one for which the Executive\r\ndeemed it essential to provide without unnecessary delay. It was\r\nmanifestly impossible that matters should remain _in statu quo_. The\r\ntime for holding the annual circuits was approaching. Mr. Sherwood was\r\nthe only Judge remaining on the bench, and a Court composed of a single\r\nJudge is not a satisfactory tribunal for all purposes of justice. The\r\nCouncil took the opinions of the law officers of the Crown as to the\r\nsoundness of the Judge's views with respect to the constitutionality of\r\nthe Court of King's Bench. Those opinions were in direct opposition to\r\nthe conclusion at which Judge Willis had arrived. The Attorney-General's\r\nwas a remarkably exhaustive and lucid exposition of the law bearing upon\r\nthe question. It was also free from ambiguity, and left little room for\r\ndoubt. These opinions were strengthened by that of Justice Sherwood,\r\nwho, at the request of the Executive, also prepared an elaborate paper\r\non the subject, in which he expressed precisely similar views to those\r\nenunciated by the Attorney-General. The question was then submitted to\r\nthe Crown officers whether the Lieutenant-Governor could legally remove\r\nJudge Willis from office and appoint a successor. The answer prepared by\r\nthe Attorney-General, and signed both by him and Solicitor-General\r\nBoulton, came with remarkable promptitude. \"Upon the points submitted to\r\nus,\" it ran, \"we are of opinion, 1st: That the power to remove an\r\nofficer depends on the tenure of his office. In this, as in other\r\ncolonies, the appointment of a judge is during pleasure; and we conceive\r\nthat in law any person holding an office on such a tenure is removable\r\nat pleasure: that is, at the pleasure of the Lieutenant-Governor, acting\r\nin the name and on behalf of the King. The reasons for such removal are\r\nto be rendered to His Majesty by the Lieutenant-Governor, who is\r\nresponsible for their sufficiency.... 2nd: We are of opinion that a\r\nremoval of a Judge of the Court of King's Bench necessarily vacates the\r\noffice, and that another person may be appointed to fill the vacancy,\r\nsubject to be confirmed or disallowed by His Majesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Executive acted with great circumspection. Fortified as they were by\r\nthese strongly-worded opinions, and assured as they felt of the legality\r\nof their contemplated proceedings, they did not permit themselves to be\r\nbetrayed into indiscretion. On the 25th of the month they addressed a\r\nletter to Judge Willis, referring to his communication to the\r\nLieutenant-Governor on the 17th, in which he had professed willingness\r\nto discharge such duties as he could legally perform. He was asked what\r\nexplanation he had to offer, and what duties he was prepared to\r\nundertake. On the 26th he replied that he did not feel at liberty to\r\npronounce an extra-judicial opinion, and that he could only define the\r\nprecise nature of his duties when the matter should come judicially\r\nbefore him. The Executive thereupon pronounced his doom, and a writ was\r\nissued whereby he was removed from office until His Majesty's pleasure\r\nshould be known. The Lieutenant-Governor, through his Secretary,\r\nnotified him that the Council had felt it incumbent upon them to advise\r\nthis step.[110] The \"amoval\" was now an accomplished fact. A vacancy was\r\nthus created on the bench, which was filled on the 2nd of July by the\r\nappointment of Christopher Alexander Hagerman to a puisne judgeship.\r\n\r\nThe news of Judge Willis's \"amoval\" spread rapidly through the Province,\r\nand produced widespread excitement. The circumstance that his course had\r\nmet with the approval of Rolph and the Baldwins led to the belief among\r\nnon-professional people that he was sound on the legal question, and\r\nthat he had been driven from the bench because he would not stoop to\r\ncorruption. The case of Judge Thorpe was exhumed from the dust of twenty\r\nyears, and the amoval of Judge Willis was believed to be a mere\r\nre-enactment of that forgotten iniquity. As for Judge Willis himself, he\r\ndetermined to proceed at once to England to present his side or his\r\ncase, in the form of an appeal from the order of amotion, at the\r\nColonial Office. Before his departure he received addresses of\r\ncondolence from various parts of the Province. Numerously-signed\r\npetitions in his favour were transmitted to the king, and to the several\r\nother branches of the Imperial and Provincial Legislatures. A long\r\nrequisition from a number of influential persons in the County of\r\nLincoln entreated him to represent their constituency in the Assembly.\r\nPeople who were usually sensible appear to have lost their heads for a\r\ntime during this exciting period. A large meeting of the Judge's\r\nsympathizers was held in Toronto, at which Dr. Baldwin and Mr. John\r\nGalt,[111] with their wives, were appointed a Committee to watch over\r\nthe interests and insure the protection of Lady Mary and her family\r\nduring the absence of her lord; and Robert Baldwin was added to the\r\nCommittee as her Ladyship's solicitor.\r\n\r\nJudge Willis took his departure from York on the 11th of July. As he\r\nexpected that he would very soon be able to procure from the Colonial\r\nOffice a reversal of his \"amoval,\" and that he would be reinstated in\r\nhis judgeship, to the great discomfiture of the Lieutenant-Governor and\r\nhis satellites, he did not think it necessary that his family should\r\naccompany him to England. The suitable disposal of the members of his\r\nhousehold was an embarrassing problem for him. In good sooth, he was in\r\na situation somewhat analogous to the man in the familiar old story, who\r\ncame to the bank of a wide stream, having in his possession a fox, a\r\ngoose, and a bag of corn. The application is easy. Mrs. Willis and Lady\r\nMary could by no means be left to keep house together unless the head of\r\nthe establishment was near at hand to keep the peace between them. The\r\nrelations between Lady Mary and Miss Willis, though far from amicable,\r\nwere somewhat less strained. Mr. Willis accordingly took with him his\r\nmother only, leaving his wife, child and sister behind him; though it is\r\nto be presumed that the above-mentioned Committee had a sinecure, so far\r\nas any special attendance upon or protection over Lady Mary was\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nA series of acrimonious despatches from the Lieutenant-Governor preceded\r\nMr. Willis across the Atlantic. For weeks--probably for months--before\r\nthe delivery of his unfortunate decision, the espionage system had been\r\nput in full operation against him, and measures had been taken to watch\r\nhis personal habits and pastimes. There had been a firm determination to\r\neffect his ruin,[112] and the strong suspicion that such was the case\r\nhad done much to array a majority of the inhabitants on his side. \"It is\r\nmy duty to state to you in the most decided terms,\" wrote Sir Peregrine\r\nMaitland to the Colonial Secretary, on the 6th of July, \"that his [Mr.\r\nWillis's] restitution to office, while it would be received by the most\r\nportion of the population as a triumph over the Government which Mr.\r\nWillis has ungratefully and wantonly insulted, would be most pernicious\r\nto the peace of this colony, and an act of the most aggravating\r\ninjustice to those faithful servants of the Crown against whom he has,\r\nfor unworthy purposes, dishonourably laboured to excite the prejudice\r\nand hatred of the ignorant and malicious.\" It is worth while to note\r\nthat this extract contains a clear admission by the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nthat his Government was regarded with disfavour by \"the most portion of\r\nthe population:\" an admission directly at variance with many statements\r\nmade by him in former despatches, as well as in speeches to the\r\nProvincial Parliament.\r\n\r\nUpon reaching England Mr. Willis put himself into immediate\r\ncommunication with the Colonial Office. He took up his quarters at the\r\nhouse of his brother, the Reverend W. D. Willis, at Bath. There he\r\nprepared an elaborate statement of his case, which was duly forwarded to\r\nthe Colonial Secretary. After some delay he succeeded in obtaining\r\ncopies of the several despatches of Sir Peregrine Maitland in which the\r\ncharges against him were formulated with wearisome reiteration. These\r\nindictments against him, which, though signed by Sir Peregrine, were\r\ndoubtless in reality prepared by Mr. Willis's arch-enemy,\r\nAttorney-General Robinson, were certainly of the most formidable\r\ncharacter. They went over the whole course of the Judge's procedure,\r\nfrom the time of his arrival in the Province down to his departure\r\ntherefrom. To the serious grounds of complaint which had unquestionably\r\nbeen given were added numerous delinquencies of the most petty and\r\ntrifling nature. It was stigmatized as \"a great indecency\" that Judge\r\nWillis had been seen in a dress \"but little according with his\r\nsituation.\"[113] In view of the interests involved, and of the grave\r\nnature of the questions to be decided, it seems ludicrous that the\r\nappellant should have been called upon to reply to an accusation of this\r\nnature.[114] A perusal of these despatches, however, rendered necessary\r\na supplementary statement and narrative, wherein every count in the\r\nindictment was either traversed, or, in legal parlance, confessed and\r\navoided. But Mr. Willis soon found that he was not to gain so easy a\r\ntriumph over his enemies as he had previously allowed himself to suppose\r\nwould be the case. The question to be decided was a purely technical\r\none, and after the matter had been for some time under consideration at\r\nthe Colonial Office it was referred for decision to the Privy Council,\r\nwhere it was not disposed of for nearly a year. The conclusion finally\r\narrived at was that Mr. Willis had been wrong in his view of the\r\nquestion in dispute, and that the Executive Council, in amoving him from\r\noffice, had not acted in excess of their authority. Under such\r\ncircumstances his return to Upper Canada was of course out of the\r\nquestion; but as his conduct was attributed to error of judgment rather\r\nthan to any serious dereliction from duty, he received an appointment to\r\na judgeship in the South American colony of Demerara.\r\n\r\nFrom all the circumstances, then, it is clear that Judge Willis, though\r\nhe was in some sense a victim of Executive intolerance in Upper Canada,\r\nwas himself largely to blame for his downfall, to which he contributed\r\nby his want of caution and calm good sense. But many of the\r\ncircumstances detailed in the present chapter were unknown to the bulk\r\nof the Canadian people, by whom he was regarded as a martyr to his\r\nupright and liberal principles. His amoval produced a wider excitement\r\nthan any event since Gourlay's time. It tended greatly to embitter\r\npublic opinion, and was unquestionably a strong factor in producing the\r\ndiscontent which ultimately found expression in open rebellion. For this\r\nreason it has been thought desirable to go somewhat minutely into\r\ndetails which are in themselves fraught with instruction, and as to\r\nwhich the people of Canada, even at the present day, are very\r\ninadequately informed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829.]\r\n\r\nMr. Willis felt his defeat very keenly, more especially as he had\r\nconfidently looked forward to a successful termination of his appeal. At\r\nhis instigation the subject was brought before the attention of the\r\nHouse of Commons by Lord Milton, on Tuesday, the 11th day of May,\r\n1830.[115] Sir George's Murray's explanation, which involved a narrative\r\nof the circumstances in detail, proved satisfactory to the House, and\r\nthe matter was allowed to drop. But the amoved Judge was fated to have\r\ngreater reasons still for deploring that he had ever taken up his abode\r\nin Canada, as his residence there led to the rupture of his family ties\r\nand the total wreck of his domestic happiness. It will be remembered\r\nthat Lady Mary and her child, together with Miss Willis, had remained at\r\nYork. Upon learning the decision of the Privy Council in his case, Mr.\r\nWillis wrote to his wife and sister, requesting them to dispose of his\r\nhouse there, and to return home as speedily as possible. During the long\r\ninterval which had elapsed since the ex-Judge's departure for England,\r\nthe two ladies had been left to amuse themselves as best they could in\r\nthe little capital. They occasionally went into society, and received a\r\ncertain amount of attention from that portion of it which had been\r\nfavourable to Judge Willis, as well as from some of the military\r\nofficers stationed there. Among others whose acquaintance they formed\r\nwas a certain Lieutenant Bernard, an officer of the 68th Light Infantry,\r\nwhose regiment was then in Canada. He occasionally rode out with Miss\r\nWillis, who was an accomplished equestrienne, but he did not appear to\r\nbe on specially intimate terms with Lady Mary. On the 16th of May, 1829,\r\nLady Mary set out for England by way of Montreal, Miss Willis remaining\r\nbehind for a week to make a final disposition of the house. On reaching\r\nKingston, Lady Mary was met by Lieutenant Bernard, who accompanied her\r\nto Montreal, whence the pair several months afterwards fled together to\r\nEngland, Lady Mary leaving her child behind her in the care of one of\r\nher maids. Mr. Willis brought an action against Bernard, who had by that\r\ntime succeeded to a Captaincy. The case was tried in the Court of Common\r\nPleas at Westminster on Thursday, the 9th of February, 1832, when the\r\nplaintiff recovered L1000 by way of damages. A report of the proceedings\r\nwill be found in _The Times_ of the following day.[116]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832.]\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to Canadian readers to learn that Mr. Willis was\r\nsome years afterwards appointed to a seat on the bench of the Supreme\r\nCourt of New South Wales. On the 8th of February, 1841, he was under a\r\nlocal statute appointed resident Judge for the District of Port Philip.\r\nWhile officiating in that capacity he came into conflict with Sir\r\nGeorge Gipps, Governor of the Colony, and the Executive Council, by whom\r\nhe was once more \"amoved\" from office. The order of amotion, which was\r\nmade on the 17th of June, 1843, was however reversed by the Imperial\r\nPrivy Council for irregularity. The Lords of the Judicial Committee,\r\nbefore whom the case was heard in June and July, 1846, reported that in\r\ntheir opinion the Governor-in-Council had power in law to amove Mr.\r\nWillis, and that the facts were sufficient to justify his amoval, but\r\nthat an opportunity ought to have been afforded him of being previously\r\nheard. The requisite notice not having been given, the omission was held\r\nto vacate the order of amotion, and judgment was rendered\r\naccordingly.[117]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[96] See his \"Narrative of Occurrences in Upper Canada,\" written from\r\nBath to the Secretary of State for the Colonial Department, dated 5th\r\nDecember, 1828, and included in pp. 273-288 of the blue book on the\r\nsubject issued by the Imperial Government in 1829.\r\n\r\n[97] There is a covert irony in the portion of Judge Willis's\r\n_Narrative_ which refers to this subject. \"I wished to think,\" he\r\nwrites, \"and from the attention he seemed to pay to business I actually\r\nworked myself up into the belief, which I frequently expressed, that Mr.\r\nJustice Sherwood was a _hard-headed_ sensible man; but I became\r\nconvinced that, though right in the former conjecture, yet so far as\r\nlegal knowledge or abilities were concerned, I was mistaken in the\r\nlatter part of my conclusion.\" The italics are Judge Willis's own.\r\n\r\n[98] See Judge Willis's _Narrative_, ubi supra.\r\n\r\n[99] So far as mere diction is concerned I have here chiefly followed\r\nCollins's own report of this episode, as published in the _Freeman_, but\r\nI have also before me the Attorney-General's account, as well as the\r\nmore elaborate one of Judge Willis himself, and the three do not\r\nmaterially differ in this respect.\r\n\r\n[100] _Ante_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[101] The _Freeman_, April 17th, 1828.\r\n\r\n[102] The case, as put by the Judge, was purely hypothetical. \"_If_ the\r\nAttorney-General has acted so and so, he has neglected his duty.\" See\r\n_ante_, p. 174.\r\n\r\n[103] The announcement ran as follows:--\"Preparing for publication.--A\r\nView of the Present System of Jurisprudence in Upper Canada; by an\r\nEnglish Barrister, now one of His Majesty's Judges in this\r\nProvince.--_Meliora sperans._\"\r\n\r\n[104] It was time for some one to undertake the duty of ameliorating the\r\ncriminal law of Upper Canada, which was that of England as it stood on\r\nthe 17th of September, 1792, except in so far as it had been altered by\r\nsubsequent legislation.

See the text of his written opinion, embodied in pp. 66-74\r\nof the Imperial blue book issued in 1829, entitled \"Papers relating to\r\nthe Removal of the Honourable John Walpole Willis from the Office of One\r\nof His Majesty's Judges of the Court of King's Bench of Upper Canada.\"\r\nIt seems probable that the suggestion emanated from Dr. Baldwin.\r\n\r\n[107] 34 Geo. III., c. 2. This statute was framed by the Hon. William\r\nOsgoode, first Chief Justice of Upper Canada, a gentleman of great\r\nlearning, who had been sent out from England for the express purpose of\r\norganizing the Courts of the Province.\r\n\r\n[108] 2 Geo. IV., c. 1.\r\n\r\n[109] See pp. 249-267 of the Imperial Government's blue book on the\r\nsubject, _ubi supra_.\r\n\r\n[110] The notification was dated the 26th of June, whereas the formal\r\ndocument issued by the Council was not signed until the 27th. Mr. Willis\r\nattached a good deal of weight to this irregularity, which however was\r\nof less importance than might at first sight be supposed. The Council\r\nhad fully made up their minds on the 26th, and the notification was\r\ndespatched accordingly, though the order of amotion was not actually\r\nready for signature until the day following.\r\n\r\n[111] The well-known author, who was then in Canada as representative of\r\nthe Canada Land Company.\r\n\r\n[112] \"Cabot,\" in _Blackwood's Magazine_ for September, 1829.\r\n\r\n[113] See despatch marked \"Separate,\" from Major-General Sir Peregrine\r\nMaitland to Mr. Secretary Huskisson, dated 6th July, 1828.\r\n\r\n[114] His reply will be matter of surprise to the staid and\r\ndecorously-attired judges of the present day. \"On all ordinary\r\noccasions,\" he wrote, \"I usually wore a _black velvet coat and\r\nwaistcoat_.

From an _obiter dictum_ of one of the judges in the case it\r\nwould appear that the order of amotion from the bench of this Province\r\nwas finally set aside on technical grounds, owing to the appellant's not\r\nhaving been heard in Canada. After diligent search, I have been unable\r\nto find any report of this decision, either in the official reports of\r\nthe Privy Council or in any of the newspapers or periodicals of the\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE CASE OF FRANCIS COLLINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages mention has several times been made of Francis\r\nCollins, editor, proprietor and publisher of _The Canadian Freeman_, a\r\nRadical weekly newspaper issued at York. Mr. Collins was an enthusiastic\r\nyoung Irish Roman Catholic, who had immigrated to Canada a short time\r\nbefore the excitement arising out of the Gourlay persecution reached its\r\nheight, and when he himself was barely twenty years of age. He was a\r\nprinter by trade, and for some time after his arrival worked as a\r\ncompositor in the office of _The Upper Canada Gazette_, published at\r\nYork by the King's Printer, Dr. Robert Charles Horne. Finding that he\r\npossessed much intelligence and a fair education, his employer deputed\r\nhim to report the debates in the Assembly during the sessions of\r\nParliament. In 1821 he reported certain proceedings which the Government\r\nwere annoyed at seeing in print, more especially as the version given\r\nwas not strictly accurate. For this offence Dr. Horne was summoned to\r\nthe bar of the House, where he sought to evade responsibility by\r\npleading that the debates had not been reported by himself, but by\r\nFrancis Collins. The Doctor further offered a humble apology, and was\r\nglad to escape with a sharp reprimand, accompanied by a caution from the\r\nSpeaker that he would thereafter be held responsible for the reports in\r\nthe _Gazette_.[118]\r\n\r\nWithin a short time after receiving this admonition Dr. Horne ceased to\r\nbe King's Printer, whereby the post became vacant. As Collins was\r\nfamiliar with the nature of the work, and was naturally desirous of\r\nbettering his condition, he applied for the appointment. The office was\r\nat the disposal of the Lieutenant-Governor, and was held entirely at his\r\npleasure. Collins was curtly checked for his presumption by a leading\r\nofficial, who informed him that the office would be conferred upon \"no\r\none but a gentleman.\" It would be interesting to know whence the\r\nofficial who was guilty of this wanton insult had derived his ideas of\r\ncourtesy and good breeding. If his statement were to be credited, any\r\napplication on his part for the post of King's Printer would most\r\nassuredly have been made in vain. The appointment was given to Mr.\r\nCharles Fothergill, who belonged to a good Yorkshire family, and was\r\ntherefore fully entitled to rank as a gentleman.[119]\r\n\r\nCollins was excusably indignant at the gross insult which had been\r\nhurled at him. He considered himself as at least the social equal of any\r\nmember of the Government, for he claimed descent from the old Irish\r\nkings, and on one or two occasions when more than ordinarily exhilarated\r\nhe had even been known to refer to his ancestor, Brian Boru. Yet, for\r\nall this mendacious and vainglorious boasting, Collins was a man of\r\nunquestionable ability, and when fully aroused could write a paragraph\r\nwell calculated to make the ears of his enemies to tingle. His\r\nnationality was clearly indicated by his personal appearance, his\r\nfeatures being rough-hewn and unmistakably Celtic; while his red hair\r\nand beard, usually not very well cared for, gave him an aspect of\r\nuncouth wildness. Up to this time he had not taken any very conspicuous\r\npart in politics since his arrival in Canada; but henceforward the\r\nExecutive had no more bitter or sleepless foe. He continued to report\r\nthe proceedings in Parliament, and kept his eyes ever open for an\r\nopportunity to strike the Government with effect. In 1825 he succeeded\r\nin establishing the _Freeman_, which was thenceforth to some extent a\r\nrival of Mackenzie's _Advocate_. It was from the first conducted with\r\ngreat energy, and the editorials, which were often set up without being\r\ncommitted to paper, displayed exceptional vigour, but they were\r\nfrequently disfigured by a coarseness and bad taste equal to anything of\r\nMackenzie's production. For some time the better class of Liberals\r\nfought shy of the enterprise, but the editor steadily forced his way\r\ninto general recognition.\r\n\r\nThe _Freeman_ was permitted to continue its course unchecked for nearly\r\nthree years. During that time it followed up the shortcomings of the\r\nExecutive with ceaseless vigilance. To Sir Peregrine Maitland and\r\nAttorney-General Robinson it was a veritable thorn in the flesh. There\r\nwas abundant occasion for criticism, and it was seldom, if ever, that\r\nCollins resorted to pure invention for the purpose of attacking the\r\ninnumerable abuses of the time. There was always a sufficient substratum\r\nof truth in his accusations to render it inexpedient to prosecute him\r\nfor libel. The punishment of what was false would have involved the\r\npublic exposure of what was true. The official party realized the force\r\nof the laureate's dictum, not then propounded, that\r\n\r\n   \"A lie that is all a lie may be met with and fought outright,\r\n   But a lie that is part of a truth is a harder matter to fight.\"\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1828.]\r\n\r\nThey of course did not present the matter in this aspect to the world at\r\nlarge. On the contrary, their organs claimed for them a spirit of\r\ngenerous and Christian forbearance. But this could not go on for ever.\r\nCollins continued to pour in his chain-shot from week to week with\r\nnever-failing pertinacity, and with seeming impunity from the law. The\r\nExecutive in the first place tried to check his career by crippling him\r\nfinancially. The Assembly had for some years previously been accustomed\r\nto vote him an annual sum by way of remuneration for reporting their\r\nproceedings. The paying over of this sum, however, was a matter entirely\r\nwithin the control of the Lieutenant-Governor. As it was known that\r\nCollins was poor, and that his resources were sometimes taxed to the\r\nuttermost to enable him to bring out his paper, it was hoped that, by\r\nwithholding payment for his services as reporter to the Assembly, he\r\nmight be compelled to suspend publication. He was accordingly informed,\r\nwhen he applied for his money in the early spring of 1828, that the\r\nfunds were not forthcoming. The sum in question was L118 10s., and was a\r\nmatter of serious importance to him; but he well understood the object\r\nof the Executive, and spurred himself up to fresh effort. His paper\r\nappeared with the most provoking regularity, and its tone was, if\r\npossible, intensified by the withholding of the sum due to its editor.\r\nHe told the story to the public, his account being garnished with\r\nprofuse comments in his bitterest vein. The Executive found that they\r\nhad miscalculated his resources, and that his press was conducted with\r\nrenewed vigour. It was finally resolved that a dead-set should be made\r\nupon him, and that he should be overwhelmed by a shower of\r\ncontemporaneous indictments. On Thursday, the 10th of April, 1828, as\r\nmentioned in the preceding chapter,[120] two bills of indictment for\r\nlibel were found against him. One of these was for having, in his paper,\r\ncharged the Lieutenant-Governor with partiality, injustice and fraud, in\r\nnot paying over the money voted by the Assembly. The other was on the\r\ninformation of the Solicitor-General, Henry John Boulton, for\r\nanimadversions on his conduct in connection with the duel, in 1817,\r\nbetween Samuel Peters Jarvis and John Ridout.[121] Upon the strength of\r\nthese indictments Collins was forthwith arrested, and compelled to\r\nappear and give the required bail. On the following morning two other\r\nbills were found, upon which he also gave bail. It was at this time that\r\nhe made his extraordinary attack upon the Attorney-General, before\r\nJustice Willis, as already narrated at length.[122] It will be\r\nremembered that he was instructed by the Judge to go before the Grand\r\nJury and prefer his complaints. These instructions he followed without a\r\nmoment's unnecessary delay. He appeared before the Grand Jury, and\r\ncharged H. J. Boulton and J. E. Small with being accessary to murder in\r\nthe killing of young Ridout. He next laid a charge of rioting against S.\r\nP. Jarvis and six other persons who had figured as defendants in the\r\naction brought by Mackenzie. The Grand Jury speedily returned a true\r\nbill against Boulton and Small. Both those gentlemen were then in Court\r\nwith their gowns on. They were immediately put under arrest, and they so\r\nremained until late in the afternoon, when Judge Willis, upon the\r\napplication of Mr. Macaulay, admitted them to bail. As Jarvis had been\r\ntried for the offence and acquitted, shortly after the duel in 1817, the\r\nGrand Jury now returned \"No bill\" as to him. On the following Monday a\r\ntrue bill was returned by the Grand Jury against the seven persons\r\ncharged with riot. They were promptly arrested and held to bail.\r\n\r\nCollins, having no faith in Attorney-General Robinson's integrity, was\r\nvery unwilling that the prosecution of these cases should be conducted\r\nby him. Boulton was not only the Attorney-General's colleague as a law\r\nofficer of the Crown, but was his warm personal friend, as well as a\r\nconnexion by marriage. Boulton, in fact, was a profound admirer and\r\nfaint _umbra_ of the Attorney-General, in whose professional sunshine he\r\nbasked, and at whose feet he may in an intellectual sense be said to\r\nhave grovelled. Even the most Spartan of Crown prosecutors could hardly\r\nbe expected to do his utmost to secure a conviction under such\r\ncircumstances; and Attorney-General Robinson had nothing of the Spartan\r\nin his composition where the interests of his friends were concerned.\r\nCollins accordingly applied to Robert Baldwin to conduct the prosecution\r\nfor murder. But the prosecution of criminal cases was not then open to\r\nthe bar as a matter of course, and without the consent of the Crown. Mr.\r\nBaldwin applied to the Court for the necessary permission, which was\r\ngranted with the Attorney-General's consent. The trial was proceeded\r\nwith before Justice Willis at the opening of the Court on the morning of\r\nMonday, the 14th. The defendants, upon being arraigned, pleaded \"Not\r\nguilty.\" The proceedings extended over two days, during which the same\r\nevidence was given that had been adduced at the trial in 1817. All the\r\nhorrible details of the duel were revived for the edification of a\r\ncrowded Court-room. Many of the spectators, as well as the Judge\r\nhimself, were affected to tears. The custom of society was once more\r\nsuccessfully pleaded in extenuation of a cruel and dastardly murder. As\r\nthe chief offender had himself escaped scot-free, however, it would have\r\nseemed anomalous to punish the accessaries. The charge from the bench\r\nwas eloquent and judicial, and the jury were absent from the box only\r\nten minutes, when they returned into Court with a verdict of acquittal.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the type-rioters next required consideration. Collins's\r\ncounsel moved for leave to the prosecutor to conduct this case also by\r\nprivate counsel, but to this the Attorney-General firmly refused to\r\nconsent. It was urged that one of the accused was his nephew, and that\r\ntwo others had been clerks in his office at the time of the outrage. No\r\nmatter; he was determined to withstand any further interference with\r\nCrown prosecutions on the part of the bar. There was no telling, he\r\nremarked, where such interference would end. There had already been too\r\nmuch of it. He was about to proceed with the prosecution, when Mr. Rolph\r\narose on behalf of Collins, and expressed a wish that, as the painful\r\ninvestigation of the murder case had been finished, the prosecutions for\r\nlibel might be discontinued. Judge Willis warmly seconded the proposal,\r\nand further suggested that the prosecution of the type-rioters might\r\nalso be dropped. The type-rioters, however, were ready and waiting for\r\ntheir trial, and, through their counsel, objected to any abandonment so\r\nfar as they were concerned. It was urged on their part that they had\r\nnever wished to avoid prosecution, but had rather courted it; that they\r\nwould accept of no compromise of a proceeding which had been maliciously\r\nand vexatiously instituted, not by the person injured, but by one who,\r\nbeing brought into Court for libel, had been received as a sort of\r\npublic prosecutor, and allowed to harass them by raking into old\r\ntransactions which had long since been investigated and atoned for. They\r\ninsisted upon the matter being there and then finally disposed of, so\r\nthat it might no longer be in the power of any malicious person wholly\r\nunconnected with the case to prosecute them at his pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe trial was then proceeded with. The persons charged were of course\r\nfound guilty. Judge Willis was very lenient, and sentenced them to a\r\nnominal fine of five shillings each, expressly stating as a reason for\r\nthis slight punishment that more than ample recompense had already been\r\nobtained in the civil action.[123]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the indictments against Collins, the Judge's appeal to\r\nthe Attorney-General was not altogether without efficacy,\r\nnotwithstanding the ill blood between them. The fact is that the latter\r\nwas glad enough of any excuse for abandoning the two prosecutions\r\ninstituted by Boulton and Jarvis, feeling well assured that there was no\r\nlikelihood of securing a conviction in either case. He could subserve\r\nhis own and his friends' interests, and at the same time assume the\r\nappearance of deferring to the suggestion from the bench. The consent of\r\nthe prosecutors having been obtained, he therefore announced in open\r\nCourt that he would proceed no further upon those indictments. He added,\r\nhowever, that there were further indictments against Collins which had\r\nemanated from the Grand Jury, and that he could not with proper\r\ndeference to them at once relinquish proceedings therein. \"But I have no\r\nobjections to state,\" said the Attorney-General, \"that I will forbear\r\nany further action during the present Assizes, and that in proceeding or\r\nnot hereafter, I shall be governed in a great measure by the sense which\r\nthe defendant shall show of his duty and obligations as the conductor of\r\na public newspaper.\" Bail was accordingly furnished by Collins on one of\r\nthe presentments. The other was tacitly allowed to lapse; and there, for\r\nthe time, the matter ended.\r\n\r\nThe editor of the _Freeman_ certainly gave the Attorney-General no\r\nexcuse for leaving him unmolested. In each successive issue of his paper\r\nhe lashed the whole race of officials, to some of whom he applied the\r\nmost opprobrious epithets. The Government organs pursued a similar\r\ncourse on their side, and characterized Collins and his friends in\r\nlanguage too gross for quotation. The Attorney-General probably repented\r\nthat he had not proceeded on at least one of the indictments during the\r\nlate Assizes, and resolved that another opportunity should not pass\r\nunimproved. The autumn Assizes opened during the second week in October,\r\nwhen he attempted to press one of the old charges against Collins. The\r\ndefendant appealed to Judge Sherwood, who occupied the bench,\r\nrepresenting that his counsel was not in Court, and that he had never\r\nbeen arraigned. The Attorney-General replied that the absence of the\r\ndefendant's counsel was not the fault of the Crown, and that he had been\r\narraigned at the spring Assizes. The latter statement was denied by the\r\ndefendant, and upon referring to the Clerk of Assize it appeared that\r\nthere had been no arraignment. Next day the Attorney-General again\r\nattempted to force on the trial, but as it was clear that the defendant\r\nhad not been arraigned the latter now claimed the right to traverse. As\r\nthis right was indisputable it was conceded by the Court, the result\r\nbeing that the defendant was entitled to have the trial held over until\r\nthe next sittings, which would not take place until the following\r\nspring. The Attorney-General, however, was entitled to demand that the\r\ndefendant should find security, and promptly urged his demand. Collins\r\nknew that were he to find the required security it would embarrass him\r\nin the conduct of his paper, and stated that he would prefer to be tried\r\nat once rather than adopt such an alternative. He was accordingly tried,\r\nand, though the prosecution was pressed against him with all the vigour\r\nat the Attorney-General's command, he was acquitted by the jury.\r\n\r\nBut the Attorney-General was not the man to allow his prey to escape him\r\nwhile any chance remained of securing a conviction. A fresh indictment\r\nwas laid against him for a personal libel upon the Attorney-General\r\nhimself. Collins, in reporting the trial which had just resulted in his\r\nacquittal, had accused the Attorney-General of \"open palpable\r\nfalsehood,\" and \"native malignancy,\" and had referred to Judge Hagerman\r\nas \"our old customer.\" This report had been published at full length in\r\nthe _Freeman_, and it was the ground of the prosecution now instituted.\r\nThe defendant laboured under the same compulsion with regard to security\r\nas before, and elected to stand his trial at once, which was precisely\r\nwhat the Attorney-General desired. The indictment, which may still be\r\nseen among the records at Osgoode Hall, was a truly formidable\r\ninstrument, and set out the offence with great prolixity. The trial took\r\nplace on Saturday, the 25th, before Mr. Justice Sherwood, who, in\r\ncharging the jury, inveighed against the defendant with nearly as great\r\nvehemence as did the Crown prosecutor, stigmatizing him as \"a wholesale\r\nretailer of calumny.\" He pronounced the _Freeman's_ report to be \"a\r\ngross and scandalous libel.\"[124] It was plainly evident that Mr.\r\nSherwood's mind was not equable, and that he was influenced by\r\nconsiderations not properly before him. The fact that his son Henry, and\r\nhis brother-in-law, H. J. Boulton, had respectively been prosecuted for\r\nriot and murder at Collins's instigation was too clearly held in\r\nremembrance, insomuch that every point was strained to the utmost\r\nagainst the defendant. Judge Sherwood, however, was absent from the\r\nbench when the jury returned into Court with their verdict, his place\r\nbeing taken by Judge Hagerman, who had many times been subjected to the\r\narrows of Collins's satire, and who was referred to with bantering\r\ncontumely in the very report which formed the subject of the present\r\nprosecution. The jury, after deliberating about five hours, brought in a\r\nverdict of \"Guilty of a libel on the Attorney-General.\" The Clerk\r\nrecorded a general verdict of \"Guilty,\" which was read to the jury. The\r\ndefendant's counsel objected to the recording of the verdict in this\r\nform, inasmuch as the jury had found his client guilty of libel on the\r\nAttorney-General only. A brief argument on the subject ensued, whereupon\r\nthe Judge charged the jury to the effect that such a verdict as they had\r\nfound could not be received. He informed them that if they found the\r\ndefendant guilty of any part of the alleged libel, they ought to return\r\na general verdict of \"Guilty;\" but that they might, if they thought\r\nproper, suggest to the Court on what particular part of the publication\r\ntheir verdict was founded, in which case the Court would confine the\r\npunishment to that part only. The jury thereupon retired a second time,\r\nbut soon returned with a general verdict of \"Guilty.\" On being asked by\r\nthe Judge whether they adhered to their former opinion as to the\r\nlibellous part of the publication, they answered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nThe sentence of the Court was not pronounced until sufficient time had\r\nelapsed to admit of a conference on the subject between Justices\r\nSherwood and Hagerman. That such a conference really took place is clear\r\nenough from a letter of Judge Sherwood himself, to be presently referred\r\nto. The sentence, when it came, created much surprise, not only in the\r\nbosom of the individual who was directly concerned, but among the public\r\nat large. It condemned the defendant to pay a fine of fifty pounds, to\r\nbe imprisoned for twelve calendar months, to find securities for his\r\ngood behaviour for three years after his liberation, himself in four\r\nhundred pounds and two sureties in one hundred pounds each, and to\r\nstand committed until all these conditions should be complied with.\r\n\r\nCertainly it was no wonder that the little world of upper Canada opened\r\nits eyes at such a Star Chamber sentence as this, pronounced in the year\r\nof Grace 1828. It seemed as if the whirligig of time had brought back\r\nthe days of Bartemus Ferguson and _The Niagara Spectator_.[125] It was\r\nan open question with many persons, even among those who were upon the\r\nwhole favourable to the measures of the Government, whether the\r\nprosecution should have been sustained at all or not. A charge of\r\n\"native malignancy\" was not likely to seriously affect the character or\r\nstanding of Attorney-General Robinson, who was ready enough to apply\r\nmuch stronger epithets to his enemies. But, however that might be, there\r\ncould be no sort of doubt that the punishment awarded was wholly\r\ndisproportionate to the offence, more especially when the defendant's\r\ncircumstances were considered. If persisted in, the sentence really\r\ninvolved the latter's perpetual imprisonment, for no two men of\r\nsubstance were likely to be found who would feel safe in guaranteeing\r\nthe good behaviour of such a turbulent spirit as Francis Collins for so\r\nlong a period as three years. Throughout the whole of this infamous\r\npersecution the Attorney-General showed to very little advantage. As\r\npreviously mentioned, he had showered four indictments upon the\r\ndefendant within the brief space of two days. Three of these he had\r\nwithdrawn, and upon the fourth the defendant had been acquitted. He had\r\nthen gone out of his way to lay a personal information upon a very\r\ninsignificant pretext. Poor Collins was his enemy, and must not be\r\nallowed to characterize his conduct as \"native malignancy,\" whereas the\r\neditors of newspapers under the patronage and pay of the Government were\r\npermitted to pursue a deliberate system of malicious vilification with\r\nimpunity. The latter were allowed to publicly malign not only individual\r\nmembers of the Opposition, but to circulate the grossest libels upon the\r\nHouse of Assembly itself. With these offences the Attorney-General did\r\nnot think fit to meddle. They were committed by his personal and\r\npolitical friends, and, unless common rumour seriously belied him, were\r\nnot seldom committed at his own instigation. At any rate he maintained\r\nthe most amicable relations with the libellers, and allowed no\r\nopportunity of serving their material interests to pass unimproved. Such\r\ninconsistency forced itself upon public attention. People who up to that\r\ntime had supported the official party began to ask where this\r\none-sidedness was to end. The Attorney-General had no right, it was\r\nsaid, to reward his friends for doing precisely the same things as those\r\nfor which he punished and imprisoned his enemies. It was remembered\r\nagainst him how, when disputing with Judge Willis as to the nature of\r\nhis official duties, he had with scorn repudiated the suggestion that he\r\nshould proceed in the absence of instructions, even against notorious\r\nevil-doers. It was remembered that he had declined to take any official\r\ncognizance of so serious an offence against the public peace as the\r\ntype-riot, which had been committed by his own friends and proteges. Yet\r\nhe had here gone out of his way to prosecute to his ruin a poor wretch\r\nwho, certainly not without great provocation, had merely accused him of\r\nfalsehood and native malignancy. A man who accommodated his conduct to\r\nhis inclinations in this way might perhaps be much beloved by his\r\nfriends, but he certainly had no claim to be considered either good or\r\ngreat. The faction, from Dr. Strachan downwards, had for years been\r\nholding up John Beverley Robinson to the admiration of Upper Canadians.\r\nBy many he had been accepted at their valuation. The Selkirk and Gourlay\r\nepisodes, together with a score of others less noteworthy, had been\r\nslurred over. As the worst of these had occurred some years before, they\r\nhad been partly forgotten by the existing generation. But the\r\nremorseless vindictiveness and cruelty displayed throughout the Collins\r\nprosecution were patent to everybody. They did much to lower the\r\nAttorney-General in popular estimation, and to destroy public confidence\r\nin the integrity of the Judges. They gave rise to an uneasy feeling of\r\ndiscontent, and doubtless had their share in bringing about the troubles\r\nof 1837-38.\r\n\r\nCollins went to jail, where, in spite of great exertions on his behalf,\r\nhe was compelled to remain for many months. The fine was paid, like the\r\ndamages in the type-riot case, by public subscription. Appeals from\r\nvarious quarters to the Lieutenant-Governor on the prisoner's behalf\r\nwere made in vain. The incumbent of that office was no longer Sir\r\nPeregrine Maitland, whose torpid and nerveless administration had\r\ncome to an end some weeks before,[126] when, as previously mentioned,\r\nhe had taken his departure for Nova Scotia. His successor as\r\nLieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada was Major-General Sir John Colborne,\r\na distinguished officer of the 52nd Regiment, who had done gallant\r\nservice in the Peninsula, and had fought at Waterloo. He is described by\r\nNapier, the historian of the Peninsular War, as having developed \"an\r\nextraordinary genius for war.\" After the return of peace he had had some\r\nexperience in diplomacy, having for some time been placed in charge of\r\nthe Government in the island of Guernsey. His appointment to the more\r\nonerous and responsible post of Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada was\r\nheralded as the precursor of better times. It was announced that he had\r\ncome over charged with instructions to reverse the fatuous policy of his\r\npredecessor, and to conduct the administration in accordance with the\r\nwell understood wishes of the people. It seems tolerably certain that\r\nsome such general directions as these had actually been given, but great\r\nlatitude was necessarily left to Sir John himself; and, as after events\r\nproved, he was ill fitted for the discharge of such duties as had been\r\nentrusted to him. He was destined to furnish, in his own person, a\r\nsufficient argument against the absurd system pursued by the Home\r\nGovernment of saddling the colonies with military rulers. That Sir John\r\nwas an excellent soldier goes without saying. It is certain, too, that\r\nhe was in the main actuated by upright and honourable motives. But he\r\nhad been \"a man of war from his youth,\" and his early training and long\r\nmilitary career had made him stern and unbending. He had no sympathy\r\nwith the aspirations of a people who were just beginning to grasp the\r\nprinciples of constitutional liberty, and who saw many things in the\r\nbody politic which called aloud for reform.\r\n\r\nIt did not take long for the people of Upper Canada to gauge the\r\ncharacter of the new Governor, for he had not been a fortnight in the\r\nProvince before he had practically allied himself with the Compact.\r\nHardly had he assumed the functions of his office ere a petition,\r\nsigned by a number of influential inhabitants of York and its\r\nneighbourhood, was presented to him by a Committee on behalf of Collins.\r\nThe facts were set out in detail, and his Excellency was asked to\r\nexercise the royal clemency by releasing the prisoner from his\r\nmelancholy situation. Sir John's reply was non-committal, but not wholly\r\ndiscouraging. It conceded the advantages resulting from a free and\r\nwell-conducted press, but expressed reverence for trial by jury, and\r\nreferred to the danger of interfering with the verdicts of juries or the\r\nopinions of Judges unless their illegality could be clearly\r\ndemonstrated. It added, however, that if his Excellency; after inquiring\r\ninto the case, should come to the conclusion that his interposition was\r\ncalled for, a communication to that effect would be made to the person\r\nchiefly concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the face of this reply, it behooved the prisoner and his friends to\r\nwait a reasonable time before taking any further steps. Within the next\r\nfew days a number of facts came to light which certainly went to show\r\nthat there were at least good grounds for a new trial. It appeared that\r\nJohn Hayden, one of the jurymen, had been ignorant of the true meaning\r\nof the word \"malignancy,\" and had sent out to the Court for Johnson's\r\nDictionary, in order to arrive at a true definition. This indulgence was\r\nrefused by the Court, and Hayden was constrained to accept the\r\ndefinition of another juror, whereby he was led to believe that the word\r\nin question has a much more serious significance than really attaches to\r\nit. By this means he had been induced to give his voice for the\r\nconviction of the defendant. Two other jurymen,[127] who were servile\r\ntools of the Attorney-General, had been actuated by undue prejudice,\r\ninsomuch that they had expressed a strong pre-determination to convict\r\nthe defendant. Then, the conduct of Mr. Hagerman, in sitting as a Judge\r\nin a case wherein he was personally concerned--it will be remembered\r\nthat he had been derisively referred to in the report which formed the\r\nsubject of the indictment--was an infringement of decency, to say\r\nnothing of its being a perversion of the letter and spirit of the law.\r\nHe had also conferred with the Judge by whom the sentence was\r\npronounced as to the measure of punishment to be awarded. But he had\r\nnot only sat in judgment in his own cause: he had refused to record the\r\nfinding of the jury, whom he had misled and coerced into bringing in a\r\nverdict contrary to what they really intended. Judge Sherwood's conduct\r\nhad been little better. He had delivered a charge to the jury which\r\npractically left them no alternative but to convict, unless they\r\naltogether disregarded his counsels. John Carey, editor of the York\r\n_Observer_, who was present on the occasion, testified that the Judge's\r\ncharge appeared to him to outrage law and common sense.[128] Then, the\r\nsentence itself was so grossly out of proportion to the offence as to\r\nshock all ideas of justice, and to form a standing menace against the\r\nliberty of the press in Upper Canada. Yet Judge Sherwood, in pronouncing\r\nit, had expressly stated that it should be light, in consequence of its\r\nbeing awarded for a first conviction. It would be curious to know what\r\npunishment he would have awarded if the defendant had been previously\r\nconvicted on a similar charge.\r\n\r\nAll these circumstances went far to prove that the defendant had met\r\nwith considerably more or less than justice. And there were other facts\r\nwhich had an ugly look. The defendant, as already mentioned, was a Roman\r\nCatholic; yet, out of a large and respectable population professing the\r\nsame religious faith, not one was to be found on the panel, although at\r\nthe Quarter Sessions, held a few days later, the number of Roman\r\nCatholics summoned to serve on juries was exceptionally large. The\r\nSheriff who empanelled the jury was a political enemy of the accused. So\r\nwas each individual member of the Grand Jury who found the true bill\r\nagainst him. So were a large majority of the petty jury by whom he was\r\ntried. So was the Attorney-General who prosecuted him. So were the two\r\nJudges who presided at the trial. Taken in connection with the specific\r\nfacts mentioned in the preceding paragraph, these matters gave rise to\r\nmany unpleasant conjectures, and it was no wonder that the public voice\r\nexclaimed against the verdict as an unrighteous one. It was no wonder\r\nthat public meetings were held in some of the rural districts to protest\r\nagainst what was almost universally pronounced to be a tyrannical abuse\r\nof the process of the Courts. It was no wonder that hisses and groans\r\nwere sometimes heard from quiet nooks and corners when the\r\nAttorney-General passed along the streets of York. And it was no wonder\r\nthat, coming, as it did, on the heels of other trials that differed with\r\nit only in degree, the case of Francis Collins caused many theretofore\r\nloyal subjects to ask themselves whether their loyalty demanded that\r\nthey should forever continue to bend their necks to the yoke of the\r\noppressor. What was Collins's case to-day might possibly be theirs or\r\ntheir sons' on the morrow.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November Collins sent in to the Lieutenant-Governor a\r\npathetically-worded petition, in which the desolate condition of his\r\nyoung and helpless family was alluded to in brief but moving terms. It\r\nset out that, in consequence of his imprisonment, the business whereby\r\nhe had supported his family was all but ruined, as its success depended\r\nsolely on his personal exertions. Finally, he prayed to be restored to\r\nhis liberty. Accompanying the petition were affidavits setting forth the\r\nadmitted ignorance of one of the jurymen, and the pre-determination of\r\nthe other two to convict. But the prisoner knocked at the gates of Sir\r\nJohn Colborne's heart in vain. The Lieutenant-Governor was by this time\r\nas completely hand and glove with the official party as his predecessor\r\nhad ever been. Dr. Strachan and John Beverley Robinson managed him with\r\ngreat skill, and, by dint of much seeming deference, had him under\r\ncomplete control. Without being in the least aware of it, he was clay in\r\nthe hands of the potter, who moulded him at will. As well might poor\r\nCollins have appealed for mercy to a half-famished tiger of the jungle\r\nas to these two Provincial representatives of law and gospel. His\r\nmemorial, dated \"York Gaol, November 26th, 1829,\" was not replied to\r\nuntil more than three weeks had elapsed, and when the answer came its\r\ncontents indicated perfect callousness to the prisoner's unhappy\r\ncondition. He was curtly informed that the Lieutenant-Governor could not\r\nthink it right to comply with the petition, but that on the expiration\r\nof the specified term of imprisonment, any application which he might\r\ndesire to make would be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the prisoner seems to have resigned himself to\r\nhis fate, although his friends did not relax their exertions on his\r\nbehalf. It seemed useless to apply for a new trial, as the application\r\nwould have to be made to either Sherwood or Hagerman, from neither of\r\nwhom could he hope to obtain justice. The _Freeman_ continued to make\r\nits appearance, although its publication was necessarily carried on\r\nunder great disadvantages. The editor's spirit was by no means broken,\r\nand he sent forth from his place of confinement a succession of\r\neditorials as bitterly vigorous as any previous efforts of his pen. He\r\nalso wrote a series of open letters addressed to the Attorney-General,\r\nin which that official's career, from his infancy onwards, was reviewed\r\nwith caustic bitterness.[129] These letters were published in successive\r\nnumbers of the _Freeman_, and must be presumed to have been a source of\r\ngreat annoyance to the gentleman to whom they were directed. Though many\r\nof the statements therein were perverse and wilful distortions of facts,\r\nthere was a large element of truth, and it would not have been easy to\r\nexpose the falsehood without admitting much that could not be denied.\r\nThe Attorney-General contemplated another prosecution, but thought\r\nbetter of it--not, it is to be presumed, from any want of\r\nvindictiveness, but because he felt that there was a limit to the public\r\nendurance, and that that limit had pretty nearly been reached.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829.]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1829, the Collins case was taken into consideration by the\r\nAssembly. A Committee was appointed, and a rigid inquiry instituted into\r\nsome of the most interesting features. Attorney-General Robinson was\r\nexamined at considerable length. Judges Sherwood and Hagerman were\r\nsummoned before the Committee, but both of them declined to answer any\r\nquestions. A good many important facts were elicited, upon the strength\r\nof which an Address to his Excellency was passed, recapitulating the\r\ncircumstances, and praying for a remission of the sentence. The reply\r\nwas of the same inexorable character as that previously made to\r\nCollins's own petition. \"It is my anxious wish,\" was the response of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, \"to render service to the Province, by concurring\r\nwith the Legislature in everything that can promote its peace,\r\nprosperity and happiness; and I regret exceedingly that the House of\r\nAssembly should have made an application to me which the obligation I am\r\nunder to support the laws, and my duty to society, forbid me, I think,\r\nto comply with.\" For the information of the House, his Excellency\r\nforwarded a copy of a letter addressed by Justice Sherwood to the\r\nGovernor's Secretary, embodying certain reasons for the judgment of the\r\nCourt in the case. The Judge, it will be remembered, refused to assign\r\nany such reasons when questioned on the subject by the Committee of the\r\nHouse of Assembly. As to his right to so refuse there can hardly be much\r\ndifference of opinion, but he would have been more consistent if he had\r\nalso refused when applied to by the Lieutenant-Governor. After admitting\r\nthe right to publish fair and candid opinions on the Government and\r\nconstitution, the Judge declared that if a publisher \"steps aside from\r\nthe high road of decency and peaceable deportment, and adopts a course\r\nof public calumny and open abuse against the officers of Government\r\ngenerally, or particularly against the principal law officer of the\r\nCrown, in the legal discharge of his duty in the King's Courts, as the\r\ndefendant did,\" then it was the Judge's conviction that the publisher so\r\noffending should be \"punished to that extent which, in human\r\nprobability, would prevent a recurrence of the offence.\" And yet this\r\nsame Judge, in pronouncing sentence, had expressly declared that the\r\nsentence should be a light one, as it was the defendant's first offence.\r\nThe conclusion of the letter showed plainly enough that a conference had\r\ntaken place between Justices Sherwood and Hagerman before the imposition\r\nof the penalty. It proved, indeed, that the sentence was to be\r\nconsidered as the joint sentence of the two Judges. \"Taking all the\r\ncircumstances of the case into consideration,\" it ran, \"Mr. Justice\r\nHagerman and myself deemed the sentence which we passed on the defendant\r\nboth proper and necessary for the public good, and what the case itself\r\nrequired.\"\r\n\r\nTwo or three further appeals were made to the Lieutenant-Governor on the\r\nprisoner's behalf, all of which proved ineffectual. The matter was\r\nreally in the hands of the Attorney-General himself, who was inexorable,\r\nand would be satisfied with nothing short of the fullest expiation. The\r\nAssembly meanwhile did not relax its efforts to obtain a commutation of\r\nthe sentence. On the 12th of March an address to the King was passed by\r\nthat body, whereby His Majesty was entreated \"to extend to Francis\r\nCollins the royal clemency, by remitting the residue of his punishment.\"\r\nNot much was hoped for from this proceeding, as it was felt that the\r\nwhole influence of the Executive would be put forward against it. The\r\nprisoner himself made up his mind to accept the inevitable, and to serve\r\nout at least the full term of the sentence imposed. He continued to\r\nsupply editorial articles for his paper, couched in a strain which\r\nseemed to indicate his superiority to circumstances. But his buoyant\r\nspirit was measurably tamed by his long imprisonment, and it was\r\nremarked that he was never again quite the same man as before. Contrary\r\nto his anticipations, the address of the Assembly finally proved\r\neffective, and he was permitted to walk forth from the jail a free man.\r\nHis paper came forth from week to week, but its tone was evidently\r\nmodified and subdued. Something of the old spirit occasionally flashed\r\nforth, but fitfully and transitorily only, like the flicker of a lamp\r\nbefore its extinction. It was clear that the editor had not forgotten\r\nthe indignity and mental suffering he had undergone, and throughout the\r\nremaining years of his life he always dwelt more or less in the shadow\r\nof the cold and solitary cell. The records of the jurisprudence of\r\ncivilized countries contain few modern instances of the exaction of so\r\nsevere a penalty for so insignificant an offence.\r\n\r\nThe narrative has no further concern with Francis Collins, except to\r\nrecord that he continued to edit and publish the _Freeman_ down to 1834,\r\nwhen he fell a victim to the cholera invasion by which the Provincial\r\ncapital was ravaged during that year. He died on the 2nd of September,\r\nand the _Freeman_ thenceforth ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[118] The Attorney-General, John Beverley Robinson, was ever valiant on\r\nthe stronger side. He tried to induce the Assembly to compel Dr. Horne\r\nto insert in the next issue of the _Gazette_ a paragraph in the\r\nfollowing words: \"From the incompetence or negligence of our reporter,\r\nthe debates of the House of Assembly inserted in the last number of this\r\npaper were so imperfect and so untruly reported that no dependence can\r\nbe placed in their accuracy.\" The Assembly, however, were satisfied with\r\nthe humiliation to which the Doctor had been subjected, and would not\r\ncompel him to further self-abasement.\r\n\r\n[119] Mr. Fothergill held the office barely three years, when he was\r\ndismissed for voting with the Opposition in the Assembly against the\r\nGovernment. It was an anomaly to permit the King's Printer to hold a\r\nseat in the Legislative Assembly, and the Government could hardly be\r\nexpected to tolerate opposition from such a quarter. Mr. Fothergill was\r\nthe first incumbent of the office to develop liberal opinions. He was\r\nsufficiently deep in the secrets of the Administration to make him a\r\ndangerous opponent if he had felt disposed to wage war to the knife. Of\r\nthis fact the Administration seem to have taken a sort of oblique\r\ncognizance. He had overdrawn his account by L360, and in settling with\r\nhim this sum was not taken into consideration. In other words, the\r\nGovernment made him a present of L360. His successor in the office of\r\nKing's Printer was Mr. Robert Stanton.\r\n\r\n[120] _Ante_, p. 171.\r\n\r\n[121] _Ante_, p. 13.\r\n\r\n[122] _Ante_, pp. 171-174.\r\n\r\n[123] _Ante_, p. 136.\r\n\r\n[124] The charge, as reported by Collins, will be found in the Appendix\r\nto the _Journals of Assembly_ for 1829, pp. 27, 28.\r\n\r\n[125] _Ante_, p. 42 et seq.\r\n\r\n[126] Sir Peregrine was gazetted to be \"Lieutenant-Governor of Nova\r\nScotia and its dependencies\" on the 14th of August, 1828. On the same\r\ndate Sir John Colborne was gazetted as Lieutenant-Governor of Upper\r\nCanada, but he did not reach the seat of his Government until late in\r\nthe autumn, and Sir Peregrine did not actually demit office until the\r\narrival of his successor.\r\n\r\n[127] William Davenish and Andrew A.

A\r\nconsiderable proportion of this material is to all practical intents\r\ninaccessible to the general reading public, being scattered here and\r\nthere through old and long-forgotten newspapers, blue-books, pamphlets\r\nand unedited manuscripts. Yet some acquaintance with it is absolutely\r\nnecessary to a clear comprehension of the deplorable state of things\r\nwhich existed in this Province during the regime of Sir Peregrine\r\nMaitland and his successor. No one who is ignorant of it is capable of\r\nexpressing an intelligent opinion as to the merits or demerits of the\r\nRebellion and those who took part therein. The principal facts and\r\ncircumstances attendant upon some of the most flagrant exhibitions of\r\nFamily Compact oppression which mark the fourth decade of Upper Canadian\r\nhistory have therefore been set forth in consecutive order, and with\r\nconsiderable minuteness. The picture thus afforded of Provincial-society\r\nand Government, though pregnant with instruction, is by no means an\r\nattractive one, and any person contemplating it for the first time may\r\nwell be excused for questioning its perfect accuracy. The drawing, at\r\ntimes, seems to be too wavy in outline, and some of the details have the\r\nappearance of being painted in colours too glaring to be natural. But a\r\nstrict examination of the properties will correct all such impressions.\r\nVarying themes require varying methods of treatment. There are certain\r\nfeatures of landscape which must not be drawn with absolute sharpness of\r\noutline, and there are subjects to which neutral tints altogether fail\r\nto do justice. Of such a character are more than one of the scenes here\r\nreproduced. Independently of the mere method of treatment, the\r\nhistorical evidence is so clear and explicit that it can be questioned\r\nby no one who takes the trouble to examine it. As to mere matters of\r\nfact, there will be little or no difference of opinion among those who\r\nconsult and compare the various authorities cited in the notes.[130]\r\n\r\nThe cases hitherto recorded are merely a few out of many, but they\r\nsuffice to tell the story of Executive cruelty and selfishness during\r\nthe period referred to more effectively than it could possibly be told\r\nwithout their aid. To set forth with equal fulness of detail the\r\ncircumstances attendant upon the persecution of Jonah Brown, Robert\r\nRandal, Hugh Christopher Thompson, and a round score of minor victims,\r\nwould be to extend this work to an interminable length. The materials\r\nfor a work written on such a plan are abundant, as they include all the\r\nfacts arising out of the stupendous iniquity sought to be perpetrated\r\nunder the guise of the Alien Bill. The particulars connected with the\r\nattempt to force this infamous measure upon the people of Upper Canada\r\ncannot be inquired into in these pages. Sufficient to say that it was a\r\nmost dishonest and unstatesmanlike attempt on the part of the Executive\r\nto get rid of political opponents by repudiating the well-understood\r\nobligations of their predecessors in office: an attempt to dispossess\r\npersons who, relying upon the faith of the Government of the day, had\r\nsettled in the country and taken up lands, to which they had received\r\ntitles, and upon which they and their parents had in many cases resided\r\never since Governor Simcoe's time. The attempt failed through the\r\nvigilance of the Opposition and the interference of the Imperial\r\nGovernment, but it proved the length to which the official party were\r\nprepared to go in order to maintain the existing order of things. It was\r\nof a piece with the rest of the Executive policy, which seemed to wax\r\nmore and more exacting and one-sided with lapse of time. It was\r\nabundantly clear to many persons unconnected with the Reform party that\r\nthere was no justice in the land for a Reformer, and that the oligarchy\r\nby whom the country was dominated cared nothing for its best interests.\r\nConstitutional liberty was systematically trampled under foot. The\r\noft-quoted boast of the Founder of the Province about the Upper Canadian\r\nconstitution being \"the very image and transcript of that of Great\r\nBritain\"[131] seemed the hollowest mockery when viewed in the light of\r\nevents which had become a matter of frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nIt was not only to the thumbs of political opponents that the Executive\r\nscrew was applied. When occasion arose it was applied with surprising\r\nenergy and vigour to the thumbs of those who had long been obedient\r\nslaves of the Administration. Nothing more clearly shows the shameless\r\nexercise of power on the part of the faction: nothing more clearly\r\nproves the complete subordination of their tools, and the depths of\r\ndegradation to which public men could be made to stoop: than an episode\r\nwhich occurred during the Parliamentary session of 1828. The persons\r\nchiefly involved were the Hon. James Baby, who was himself\r\nInspector-General of Public Accounts and senior member of the Executive\r\nCouncil, and ex-Chief Justice Powell. It has already been explained that\r\nthe first-named personage had for some time past ceased to carry any\r\ngreat weight at the Council Board, where he had been to a considerable\r\nextent superseded by his juniors.[132] His seniority was merely in point\r\nof time, and his influence on the policy of the Government was as\r\ninsignificant as it possibly could be, consistently with the position\r\nwhich he held. He keenly felt his having been, so to speak, thrust into\r\nthe background, and in several instances showed a disposition to assert\r\nhimself by acting independently. A similar feeling, but milder in\r\ndegree, animated the breast of the ex-Chief Justice, whose place as\r\nprincipal lay adviser of the Lieutenant-Governor had long since been\r\ntaken by Attorney-General Robinson. During the session of 1823-4 he had\r\nseen fit to protest against a School Bill passed by the Assembly, under\r\nwhich Dr. Strachan was intended to and did actually derive a sinecure\r\nsalary of three hundred pounds a year. His protest, at his own urgent\r\nrequest, was entered on the journal, where it seemed likely to remain a\r\nperpetual memento of his independence and of the servility of his\r\ncolleagues. But this was by no means desired by the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nand the Attorney-General. Pressure was brought to bear upon the\r\nrecalcitrant member, under the influence of which he was forced to\r\nsuccumb. He consented that the protest should be erased from the\r\njournal, and it was erased accordingly.[133] But a still more sickening\r\nhumiliation was in store for him, as well as for the venerable Mr. Baby.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1828 several petitions were received by the\r\nAssembly praying for relief against a law passed in 1825, whereby\r\ncertain taxes had been imposed on wild lands.[134] Among other\r\ngrievances complained of was the manner in which the law had been\r\npassed. It was distinctly alleged in one of the petitions that the\r\nmeasure had been pushed through both Houses with too great rapidity, and\r\nthat most culpable means had been employed in order to procure the\r\nassent of certain members to whom it was objectionable. The Assembly\r\nentertained the petitions, and appointed a Committee to inquire into the\r\nmatter. A number of witnesses were examined, and some astounding facts\r\nelicited. The allegations as to undue influence were proved by the\r\nclearest evidence, and by witnesses who had generally been accustomed to\r\nact with the Government. One of these was our somewhile acquaintance,\r\nthe Hon. William Dickson, who, as has previously been seen, was the\r\nowner of an immense tract of land,[135] and was consequently seriously\r\naffected by the law enacted in 1825. His evidence, as printed in the\r\nAppendix to the Journals of the Assembly,[136] stands as a perpetual\r\nindictment against Sir Peregrine Maitland and the venal clique by whom\r\nhe was surrounded. It appears that from the time when the Bill relating\r\nto the taxation of wild lands was first introduced into the Upper House\r\nit was an unpopular measure, and that it was opposed by a majority of\r\nthe members. Most of the latter were large landholders by virtue of\r\ntheir membership, and some of them had acquired additional blocks by\r\npurchase. The obnoxious Bill was opposed at every stage, and there\r\nseemed to be no possibility of its becoming law. Its defeat being\r\nregarded as inevitable, its opponents to some extent relaxed their\r\nefforts, and congratulated each other upon their apparent success. On\r\nthe third reading, however, Mr. Dickson found, to his supreme\r\nastonishment and disgust, that some of the members upon whom he had\r\nrelied for votes presented an entire change of front, and appeared in\r\nthe _role_ of supporters of the measure. It was noticeable that all the\r\nconverts, or perverts, held offices under the Government. The Hon. John\r\nHenry Dunn, Provincial Receiver-General, took a different course. He had\r\nbeen among the most determined opponents of the Bill, and had declared\r\nthat it would never pass.[137] He had too much self-respect, after\r\ntaking such a stand, to give the lie to all his protestations by voting\r\nfor the measure, so he quietly staid at home on a pretence of\r\nsickness.[138] Referring to those who took a more determined stand, by\r\nvoting contrary to their pledges, Mr. Dickson says: \"This change, I am\r\nsatisfied, arose from intimidation by the Local Government, who seemed\r\ndetermined to carry the measure at any sacrifice. It was most painfully\r\nmanifest from their countenances and demeanour that the change was not\r\nfrom conviction, but from coercion. The business of the Legislative\r\nCouncil was suspended for two hours for a meeting of the Executive\r\nCouncil. And I do believe that at that Council the members of the\r\nLegislative Council holding offices were constrained at the peril of\r\ntheir situations to vote for the measures they had a week before\r\ndecidedly opposed. Upon those members returning that day to their\r\nlegislative duties there was a change of voting, and one of those who\r\nstaid away on pretence of sickness was, to my knowledge, able to\r\nattend.\" The reference here is presumably to Mr. Dunn. Mr. Dickson's\r\nevidence then goes on to say that about ten minutes before the vote was\r\ntaken, a message was delivered to the Hon. James Baby that Major Hillier\r\nwished to speak to him. Major Hillier was the Lieutenant-Governor's most\r\nconfidential secretary, and was employed in numberless little\r\ntransactions requiring the exercise of coolness and tact. In response to\r\nthe message Mr. Baby left his place in the House, and did not return for\r\nsome time. Upon his return from the interview to his accustomed seat he\r\nwas evidently much confused and agitated. Being spoken to by Mr. Dickson\r\nhe found it impossible to conceal his agitation, but told his\r\ninterlocutor, to that gentleman's great astonishment, that he must vote\r\nfor the Bill. When the time came he accordingly voted with the\r\nGovernment, and the Bill was carried by a small majority, Messieurs\r\nDickson and Clark entering a determined protest against it. \"After the\r\npassing of the Bill,\" continues Mr. Dickson, \"the Hon. Mr. Baby, after\r\nleaving the House, put his hand upon his heart, and, with reference to\r\nhis change of conduct on the measure, said something about his children,\r\nexpressive of his regret at the necessity which drove him to the\r\nabandonment of the course he had pursued.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Powell, who was then Speaker of the Legislative Council, was\r\nevidently subjected to similar influences. Like Mr. Baby, he had been\r\nstrenuous in his opposition to the Bill, and had even gone so far as to\r\nspeak harshly of some of those who promoted it. But he was speedily made\r\nto know his place, and the tenure by which he held it. During a portion\r\nof the two hours when the business of the Legislative Council was\r\nsuspended he was in secret conference with Major Hillier and one or more\r\nmembers of the Executive Council.[139] When he took his seat upon the\r\nresumption of the business of the day, it was noticeable that he, as\r\nwell as Baby, was labouring under undue embarrassment and agitation. It\r\nwas beyond any reasonable doubt that they had been shamelessly coerced,\r\nand had been compelled to choose between voting as they were commanded\r\nor being dismissed from their respective offices. Upon being questioned\r\nby Mr. Dickson, Powell admitted that he had changed his opinion, and\r\nadded, in seeming sincerity, that he had received new light on the\r\nmatter within the last ten minutes. Such an exchange of an old lamp for\r\na new one must surely have been the work of some malignant and monstrous\r\ngenie at the Council Board.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that Dickson's evidence, so far as \"extraordinary\r\nand undue influence by the Local Government\" is concerned, is fully\r\nconfirmed by the evidence of the Hon. Thomas Clark, who was also a\r\nmember of the Upper House, and was present at the proceedings above\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nThere could not well be any more conclusive proof of the\r\nunconstitutional and corrupt manner in which the Government was carried\r\non during Sir Peregrine Maitland's time than is afforded by the\r\ncircumstances just narrated. They read like a chapter out of the\r\npolitical history of England during the last century. The methods\r\nemployed by Walpole exhibit nothing baser or more repulsive than these.\r\nHis aphorism about \"every one of them\" having his price might well have\r\nbeen echoed by Sir Peregrine, so far as the Legislative Council was\r\nconcerned, with the addition that the price in Upper Canada was\r\nsometimes ridiculously low. The persons who were guilty of these gross\r\nviolations of the constitution, to say nothing of the commonest\r\nprinciples of honesty, were incessantly prating of their devoted loyalty\r\nto the Crown. Yet it is plain enough that their fealty was always\r\nsubservient to what they deemed to be their personal interests. This was\r\nas clearly apparent in 1837 as it had been in 1828. When, a few years\r\nlater,[140] a crisis arose in which they were compelled to choose\r\nbetween those interests and their devotion to the Crown, it was once\r\nmore abundantly manifest that theirs was the veriest lip-loyalty. The\r\nburning of the Parliament Buildings at Montreal was as direct an act of\r\ntreason as was the affair at Montgomery's Farm.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1829.]\r\n\r\nIn 1828 there was a general election, in the course of which the\r\nExecutive party made tremendous exertions to regain a predominating\r\ninfluence in the Assembly. They perceived plainly enough that a hostile\r\nmajority in the Lower House must in the end prove fatal to them. They\r\nmight temporarily set it at naught, through their control over the\r\nLegislative Council and the absence of ministerial responsibility, but\r\nthey could not hope to keep up such a farce for all time. This knowledge\r\nimpelled them to adopt every means which their ingenuity could devise to\r\nsecure the return of candidates who might be relied upon to support\r\ntheir policy. Their success was by no means proportionate to their\r\nefforts. When the returns were all in it appeared that the Opposition\r\nhad rather gained than lost by the contest. Two staunch members of the\r\nCompact were defeated in what had theretofore been regarded as safe Tory\r\nboroughs, and Attorney-General Robinson's majority in the Town of York\r\nwas greatly diminished. All the most prominent Reformers were returned,\r\nand at the opening of the session on the 8th of January, 1829, Rolph,\r\nBidwell, Perry, Matthews and Dr. Baldwin took their seats on the\r\nOpposition benches. To their number was now added William Lyon\r\nMackenzie, who had been returned for the County of York. His election\r\nwas a surprise to the Government party, and was pronounced by them to be\r\nan everlasting disgrace to the intelligent and populous constituency\r\nwhich had returned him. He repaid such compliments as these with others\r\nof a like character, and gave back as much as he received, if not with\r\nusury, at least with fair interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Bidwell was elected to the Speaker's chair by the new Assembly, and\r\non every test question the Government were left in a hopeless minority.\r\nThe vote on the Address in Reply will afford some clue to the political\r\ncomplexion of the House. It referred to the Lieutenant-Governor's\r\nadvisers as having deeply wounded the feelings and injured the best\r\ninterests of the country; yet it was carried with only one dissentient\r\nvote--that of J. H. Samson, one of the members for Hastings. Reform was\r\nevidently in the ascendant throughout the Province; but, as during the\r\npreceding Parliament, the exertions of the majority in the Assembly\r\ncould do little for Reform under the existing state of the constitution.\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor responded with curt ambiguity to the Assembly's\r\nAddress, and cemented his alliance with the Compact by refusing to grant\r\nthe prayer of the petition for the release of Collins. The Government\r\nsubmitted to one defeat after another with dogged sullenness, but with\r\nundiminished contempt for the idea that successive defeats imposed upon\r\nthem any obligation to resign.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1829 was a noisy and quarrelsome one. Hardly had\r\nMackenzie taken his seat before he began that system of inquiry and\r\nagitation which he thenceforward pursued throughout the whole of his\r\ncareer as a member of Parliament. He instituted an investigation into\r\nthe management of the Provincial Post Office, conducted an inquiry as to\r\nthe privileges of members of the Assembly, and as to the behaviour of\r\ncertain returning officers, and generally busied himself with important\r\nmatters of detail. He displayed precisely the same characteristics as a\r\nlegislator that he had displayed as the conductor of a newspaper--great\r\nenergy and vigilance, accompanied by a critical and fault-finding\r\nspirit, and an almost entire absence of tact and discretion. He gave\r\nwanton and unnecessary offence to those who differed from him in\r\nopinion, not only on important political questions, but even on\r\ncomparatively insignificant matters of every-day occurrence. His\r\ncoadjutors found that, independently of the sincerity or insincerity of\r\nhis intentions, his judgment was not to be trusted. He could be misled\r\nby any _ignis fatuus_ that displayed a bright light, and was led into\r\nmany a Serbonian bog from which he was not extricated without serious\r\ndifficulty. Some men have an unerring instinct which, even in the\r\nabsence of calm judgment or mature reflection, commonly leads them in\r\nthe right path. Mackenzie's first conceptions, on the contrary, were\r\nalmost invariably erroneous; and he had a perverse habit of frequently\r\nclinging to an idea once formed, even when experience and deliberation\r\nhad proved it to be unsound.[141] At other times his opinions were as\r\nchangeable as the hue of the chameleon. In short, he was a creature of\r\nimpulse, and too often acted upon the motto of \"First fire--then\r\ninquire.\" This was perhaps a misfortune rather than a fault, and under\r\nordinary circumstances would have merited lightness of touch on the part\r\nof the historian. But Mr. Mackenzie is identified with a movement which\r\nforms a conspicuous and dramatic passage in Upper Canadian chronicles,\r\nand in justice to others it becomes highly necessary to form a correct\r\nestimate of his personality. This is all the more essential from the\r\nfact that he himself at different times gave various and conflicting\r\naccounts of the episode with which his name is inseparably blended,\r\nwhich accounts have hitherto been the only sources of information drawn\r\nupon by so-called historians. All the references to the Upper Canadian\r\nRebellion to be found in current histories are traceable, directly or\r\nindirectly, to Mackenzie himself, and all are built upon false\r\nhypotheses and perverted representations of events. To Mackenzie, more\r\nthan to any other person, or to all other persons combined, are to be\r\nattributed all the worst consequences which flowed from that\r\nfeebly-planned and ill-starred movement. All the facts point to the\r\nconclusion that if he had been content to play the patient and\r\nsubordinate part properly belonging to him, the whole course of his\r\nsubsequent life might have been shaped much more smoothly, and he might\r\nhave been saved the most serious of the privations which he was\r\ncompelled to undergo. Much sorrow and suffering would also have been\r\nspared to others. The injury that may be done in a primitive community\r\nby a man who combines good intentions and great energy with excessive\r\nobstinacy, misguided ambition, and perversity of judgment, is simply\r\nincalculable. The subsequent course of the narrative will be found to\r\nfully bear out these reflections, and to point a moral even where there\r\nis no intention to moralize.\r\n\r\nBeyond the perpetual friction which was kept up between the Executive\r\nbody and the Opposition, the session of 1829 was barren of events of\r\npermanent political importance. The Executive was tolerably independent\r\nof the popular branch of the Legislature, for it retained the casual and\r\nterritorial revenues, and could get along without an annual vote for\r\nsupplies. No fewer than twenty-one Bills passed by the Assembly were\r\nrejected by the Legislative Council during the session. \"The Province,\"\r\nsays Mr. MacMullen,[142] \"presented the unconstitutional spectacle of a\r\nGovernment requiring no moneys from the Assembly, and a Legislative\r\nCouncil of a totally different political complexion from the popular\r\nbranch of the Legislature. No restraint could now be imposed on the\r\nExecutive by an annual vote of supplies. It was completely independent\r\nof the people.\" And it declared its independence in the most emphatic\r\nmanner by inserting in one of the Lieutenant-Governor's messages a\r\ndirect intimation that the Assembly would not be asked to trouble itself\r\nabout ways and means.\r\n\r\nCertain episodes occurred during this session which are deserving of\r\nsomething more than passing reference, not only as indicative of the\r\nmanners of those times, but because they concern personages whose\r\nachievements were fated to occupy much space in the annals of our\r\ncountry. The Lieutenant-Governor, Sir John Colborne, had not long been\r\ninstalled in office before he was exhibited in effigy in the streets of\r\nHamilton. Certain Tories who were believed to have taken part in the\r\nexhibition openly asserted that the Hamilton Reformers were responsible\r\nfor it. It was at the same time alleged that there was a plot on the\r\npart of the Reformers to release Francis Collins from York jail by force\r\nof arms. The two stories emanated from a common source, and as they were\r\nwithout any foundation in truth the Reform leaders in the Assembly\r\ndeemed it proper to institute an inquiry into the matter. Upon motion of\r\nMr. John Rolph a Committee of Investigation was appointed, with power to\r\nsend for persons and papers. It was known that Allan Napier MacNab, who\r\nwas then an impecunious young lawyer in Hamilton, could give certain\r\nimportant information about the affair, and he was summoned to appear\r\nbefore the Committee during the second week in February. He obeyed the\r\nsummons, so far as presenting an appearance was concerned, but he\r\nrefused to reply to certain questions put to him, and conducted himself\r\nwith great insolence and want of discretion. Being again summoned before\r\nthe Committee, to answer for his conduct, he read a written defence\r\nwhich had been prepared for him, and which rather aggravated his offence\r\nthan otherwise. Accordingly, on motion of Dr. Baldwin, seconded by\r\nGeorge Rolph, the future baronet was committed to York jail, under\r\nwarrant of the Speaker, during the pleasure of the House. After\r\nremaining in custody about ten days, Mr. MacNab addressed a letter to\r\nthe House which reads very much like a repetition of his former\r\ncontempt, but which the Assembly seem to have construed very charitably,\r\nas on the 3rd of March a motion was carried for his discharge, and he\r\nwas set at liberty.\r\n\r\nThis brief term of imprisonment, which in all lasted less than a\r\nfortnight, was the turning point in the reckless young lawyer's career.\r\nUp to that time he had been nobody, and had had no apparent prospect of\r\never attaining to any importance. But from this time forward the\r\nofficial party regarded him in the light of a martyr who had suffered in\r\nthe good cause. They feasted and lionized him, and did their utmost to\r\nadvance his fortunes. At the elections which took place during the\r\nfollowing year they returned him as one of the representatives of the\r\nCounty of Wentworth in the Assembly, where, though he lacked sufficient\r\nballast to display anything like statesmanship, he made considerable\r\nnoise, and erelong became a notable personage. He was voluble, and made\r\nmany verbose speeches, the matter of which never rose above the veriest\r\ncommonplace, but as it was always charged with emphatic High Toryism it\r\nwas applauded to the echo by the official party. Eventually, as every\r\nCanadian knows, he obtained high distinction and eminence, and had\r\nabundant reason to bless the discipline which he had received at the\r\nhands of a Parliamentary Committee. But for that discipline he might\r\nhave lived and died an obscure country lawyer. To that discipline he was\r\nindebted for all the honours which subsequently descended upon him. By\r\nits aid he successively became a member of the Upper Canadian\r\nParliament, Speaker of the Assembly, Commander-in-Chief of the Upper\r\nCanadian land forces during the Rebellion, Knight, Queen's Counsel,\r\nmember of the United Parliament of Canada, leader of the Tory Party in\r\nthe Canadian Legislature, Premier, President of the Council and Minister\r\nof Agriculture, Baronet, honorary Colonel in the British Army,\r\nAide-de-Camp to the Queen, Speaker of the Legislative Council. He also\r\nbecame father-in-law to a peer of the realm, and died Sir Allan MacNab\r\nof Dundurn. Certain passages of his life will form the subject of future\r\nconsideration. Meanwhile it will be sufficient to remark that each\r\nsuccessive link in the long chain of his triumphs may be distinctly\r\ntraced to his supposed martyrdom at the hands of the Reform majority in\r\nthe Upper Canadian Assembly in 1829.\r\n\r\nAnother personage cited to appear before the Assembly's Committee on the\r\nsame investigation was the Hon. H. J. Boulton, Solicitor-General. He\r\ndisplayed the same reticence as young MacNab, and refused to reply to\r\ncertain questions put to him by the Chairman. He was soon taught that\r\nthe high position which he occupied, backed, as it was, by the support\r\nof the party in power, could not shield him from the consequences of his\r\nrefusal. Upon motion of Dr. Baldwin a resolution was adopted that the\r\nSolicitor-General had been guilty of a high contempt and breach of the\r\nprivileges of the House. He was placed at the bar, where he showed more\r\nsense of propriety than had been shown by his predecessor. He had no\r\ndesire to wear a crown of martyrdom, and did his utmost to purge himself\r\nof his contempt. He pleaded that he had intended no disrespect to the\r\nCommittee, nor any breach of the privileges of the Assembly, and\r\nconcluded by saying that he stood ready to answer, if the House so\r\ndesired. The House acted magnanimously, not choosing to humiliate a\r\nbeaten man any farther than was necessary for the due vindication of its\r\nown authority. John Rolph, seconded by Dr. Ambrose Blacklock, one of the\r\nmembers for Stormont, moved that the Solicitor-General be admonished by\r\nthe Speaker, and discharged on payment of fees to the Sergeant-at-Arms.\r\nThe motion was carried, and it only remained for the culprit to submit\r\nto the mild discipline which he had been adjudged to bear.\r\n\r\nBut there was reason for believing that that discipline would be a\r\ntrying ordeal for the Solicitor-General. The Speaker who was to\r\npronounce the admonition was no commonplace piece of clay, trained to\r\nthe set phrase of office, like the previous occupant had been. He was no\r\nless a personage than Marshall Spring Bidwell, who, with perhaps the\r\nsingle exception of John Rolph, was the most eloquent and powerful\r\nspeaker in the Province. When moved to righteous anger, he was capable\r\nof administering a scorching reproof, and if a man is ever justified in\r\ntaking his antagonist at a disadvantage, ample justification was to be\r\nfound in the present instance. Mr. Bidwell had reason to hate the very\r\nname of Boulton, and might well be expected to avail himself of such an\r\nopportunity of darting the hot iron into his enemy's soul. There was a\r\nfeud of long standing between the Bidwells and the Boultons. The\r\nBidwells had sustained serious wrong and insult at the hands of the\r\nBoultons, and the Boultons hated the Bidwells with the hatred which\r\nsmall natures always feel towards higher natures which they have\r\nwronged. It was a Boulton who had been despatched to Massachusetts in\r\n1821, to hunt up evidence as to the alleged misconduct of the elder\r\nBidwell.[143] It was this same Henry John Boulton who had joined with\r\nhis friend the Attorney-General in abusing and maligning the elder\r\nBidwell during the election campaign of 1821, and afterwards. It was he\r\nwho had put forth all the little strength that was in him to assist his\r\nparty in bringing about the expulsion of the elder Bidwell from the\r\nAssembly.[144] He had done his utmost, and successfully, to induce\r\nmembers of Parliament to vote for the statute which had forever closed\r\nthe doors of the Upper Canadian Legislature to the ex-member of\r\nCongress.[145] He had opposed the return of the younger Bidwell to the\r\nAssembly, and more recently, though he was not then a member of the\r\nHouse, he had done what he could to keep him out of the Speaker's Chair\r\nby influencing members in favour of John Willson. He had lost no\r\nopportunity of making himself personally offensive to Mr. Bidwell, whose\r\nabilities he envied, and whose character he was utterly incapable of\r\nappreciating. It will thus be seen that all the attendant circumstances\r\ncombined to make Mr. Bidwell hate and contemn his adversary. If he\r\nfailed to do so the explanation was to be found in his own gentle\r\nnature, and not in the lessons of humiliation which the Boultons had\r\nendeavoured to impose upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was a memorable scene when the Solicitor-General stood up, on the\r\n20th of February, to receive the admonition which he had been adjudged\r\nto endure. He was in a state of tremor, for he was conscious of the\r\ndisadvantage of his position, and he dreaded the power of the Speaker's\r\ntongue. His friends also felt much solicitude on his account, for they\r\nknew how little consideration he deserved at the hands of the man who\r\nnow had him in his power. For some moments a solemn silence reigned\r\nsupreme. Then the Speaker's voice was heard; low at first, but steadily\r\nrising into clear and impressive tones which made every word sink deep\r\ninto the hearts of the listeners. And the words themselves: how\r\ndifferent from what the expectant personage at the bar had looked for!\r\nNothing of malice or revenge there. Nothing but quiet dignity and\r\nforbearance. No mere spectator could have told whether the offender was\r\na personal friend or an enemy of the Speaker. The voice was full of\r\nfeeling, but utterly devoid of passion or malevolence. The power of\r\nParliament was fully vindicated, yet the transgressor escaped without\r\nany unnecessary laceration of his pride. \"By every member of the\r\ncommunity,\" proceeded Mr. Bidwell, \"a ready and cheerful respect should\r\nbe shown towards the House of Assembly, who represent the people of the\r\nProvince, whom the constitution has entrusted with important privileges\r\nfor the benefit of their constituents, and who are amenable to them for\r\nall that they do. But it might in a peculiar degree have been expected\r\nof you, whose duty it is to enforce submission to the laws and respect\r\nfor the institutions of the country.\" Here Mr. Boulton bowed his head as\r\nif in mute assent. He was then informed that the House could not permit\r\nthis formal and gratuitous denial of its authority to pass unnoticed.\r\n\"It is important,\" continued the Speaker, \"that by its proceedings\r\nagainst you a warning should be given, before others are led by the\r\ninfluence of your sentiments and conduct to dispute an authority which\r\nthe House is bound to vindicate and enforce. It is necessary that it\r\nshould go thus far; but it gives me great satisfaction to observe that\r\nits duty does not compel, nor its inclination induce it, in your case,\r\nto go any farther than is requisite to attain this object; and, finding\r\nfrom your answer that you are now disposed to treat its privileges with\r\njust and becoming respect, and to defer your own private opinion to the\r\njudgment of that body whose constitutional right it is to decide upon\r\nits own privileges, it is willing to dismiss you with no other\r\npunishment than this admonition from its Speaker. This moderation is a\r\nproof that these privileges have been safely lodged by the constitution\r\nin its hands, and that they will never be used in a wanton or oppressive\r\nmanner. It is by the order and in the name of the House that I thus\r\nadmonish you, and direct that the Sergeant-at-Arms do now discharge you\r\nfrom custody.\" He was discharged accordingly, and left the house\r\nprofoundly affected by the magnanimity of the man whom he had so\r\ngrievously injured. One who seems to have watched him as he took his\r\ndeparture has recorded that the Boulton crest never hung so low as at\r\nthat hour.[146] Nothing could have more clearly proved the greatness of\r\nsoul of Mr. Bidwell than this episode; nothing could have more\r\neffectually illustrated his capacity to rise superior to all merely\r\npersonal considerations when entrusted with the discharge of a public\r\nduty. The London _Times_ published a full report of his admonition,\r\nwhich it pronounced to be the best paper of the kind on record.\r\n\r\nDuring the following summer an event took place which removed\r\nAttorney-General Robinson from the atmosphere of the Assembly, and was\r\nthe indirect means of introducing Robert Baldwin to public life. This\r\nwas the appointment of Mr. Robinson to the place of Chief Justice of\r\nUpper Canada. The office had just become vacant through the retirement\r\nof Chief Justice Campbell, who had received the honour of knighthood\r\nduring his absence in England. Mr. Robinson thus obtained the reward\r\nwhich he had long coveted, and which his devotion to successive\r\nLieutenant-Governors had richly earned. There was some doubt as to the\r\nstrict legality of his passing directly from the office of\r\nAttorney-General to that of Chief Justice. To remove the doubt he\r\naccepted the position of Registrar of the County of Kent, which he\r\nresigned after holding it a few days. His appointment to the Chief\r\nJusticeship was made on the 13th of July, but owing to the delay\r\noccasioned by his acceptance of the inferior office it was confirmed and\r\nre-dated on the 3rd of August following. He then took his seat on the\r\nbench, and was destined to remain there for more than thirty-three\r\nyears. As Chief Justice he succeeded to the Presidency of the Executive\r\nCouncil, and at the opening of the session in the beginning of 1830 he\r\nwas nominated Speaker of the Upper House. His removal from the Assembly\r\ntherefore did not remove him from the political arena, and for years\r\nafterwards he continued, in conjunction with his friend and quondam\r\ntutor Dr. Strachan, to direct the policy of the Government as completely\r\nas he had done for some years previously. He was succeeded in the office\r\nof Attorney-General by Henry John Boulton. The temporary purpose for\r\nwhich Mr. Hagerman had been appointed to the bench, in place of Mr.\r\nJustice Willis, having been fully effected, that gentleman now\r\nthrew off his official robes and succeeded his friend Boulton as\r\nSolicitor-General.\r\n\r\nMr. Robinson's elevation to the bench left a vacancy in the\r\nrepresentation of the Town of York. This vacancy young Robert Baldwin\r\nsuccessfully aspired to fill. At the last general election, in\r\nconjunction with J. E. Small, he had unsuccessfully contested the County\r\nof York with W. L. Mackenzie and Jesse Ketchum. He was now opposed in\r\nthe town by the same individual who had so lately been his coadjutor in\r\nthe county. Mr. Small was defeated, but, at his instance, the return was\r\ndeclared void, the writ for the election having inadvertently been\r\nissued by the Lieutenant-Governor instead of by the Speaker of the\r\nAssembly, as in strictness it should have been. A new writ was issued,\r\nand Mr. Baldwin again contested the seat, his opponent now being the\r\nSheriff of the County, William Botsford Jarvis. The Sheriff naturally\r\nenjoyed many advantages in such a contest, but he was defeated by a\r\nconsiderable majority, and on the opening of the session in the\r\nfollowing January, Robert Baldwin, then in his twenty-sixth year, took\r\nhis seat in Parliament for the first time. He however did not make any\r\nconspicuous figure during the session. He had already fully imbibed the\r\nidea that a responsible Executive was the great want of Upper Canadian\r\npolity, and took comparatively little interest in the subordinate\r\nquestions of the day. He could see no good purpose to be served by\r\nrecording successive majorities against the Government, so long as the\r\nmembers of that Government could retain their offices, together with the\r\nfavour of the Lieutenant-Governor, in spite of any vote which the\r\nAssembly might see fit to record. He made no remarkable speeches, and\r\nseemed rather disposed to remain in the background. It so happened that\r\nhe did not again have an opportunity of winning honours in the\r\nLegislature for many years, as, in consequence of the death of the king,\r\na dissolution of Parliament took place before the time had arrived for\r\nthe meeting of another session, and Robert Baldwin was one of the many\r\nReform candidates who were beaten at the general elections which ensued.\r\n\r\nThere are few facts worthy of record in connection with the session of\r\n1830. In the Speech from the Throne the Lieutenant-Governor was able to\r\nannounce that the revenue at the disposal of the Crown had been found\r\nsufficient to meet the requirements of the civil list, and that there\r\nstill remained a considerable surplus in the Provincial Treasury. The\r\nAssembly's Address in Reply once more drew his Excellency's attention to\r\nthe want of confidence felt in the advisers by whom he was surrounded.\r\n\"We still feel unabated solicitude about the administration of public\r\njustice,\" it ran, \"and entertain a settled conviction that the\r\ncontinuance about your Excellency of those advisers who from the unhappy\r\npolicy they pursued have long deservedly lost the confidence of the\r\ncountry, is highly inexpedient, and calculated seriously to weaken the\r\nexpectations of the people from the impartial and disinterested justice\r\nof His Majesty's Government.\" The response to this intimation is\r\nprobably the briefest official deliverance of the kind on record.\r\nDivested of the formal commencement, it contained exactly six short\r\nwords: \"I thank you for your Address.\" The number of Bills passed by the\r\nAssembly and rejected by the Upper House during the session was\r\ntwenty-seven. In addition to these there were several Bills which\r\noriginated in the Assembly, but were afterwards rejected by that House\r\nby reason of amendments made to them by the Legislative Council.[147]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[130] It has not been thought desirable to incumber the text with\r\nfootnotes except where they seemed to be needed for purposes of\r\nelucidation; but in every matter of real importance, where the reader of\r\naverage information and intelligence may reasonably be supposed to be in\r\ndoubt as to the source of the narrative, care has been taken to indicate\r\nthe authority.\r\n\r\n[131] _Ante_, p. 48.\r\n\r\n[132] _Ante_, p. 140.\r\n\r\n[133] See _Seventh Report of Grievance Committee_, p. xxxvii.

One of the foremost of these,\r\nin a conversation with me a short time since, remarked: \"Mackenzie\r\ngenerally meant well, but he was unpractical and unmanageable. I knew\r\nhim intimately from his boyhood, and I am compelled to say that whenever\r\nhe was in the least excited he acted like a spoiled child. He underwent\r\nno change in this respect, and was the same in youth, manhood and old\r\nage. A more unfit person to be entrusted with the management of any\r\ngreat enterprise, or with the control of his fellow-creatures, I can\r\nhardly conceive.\" I have abundant written testimony to the same effect.\r\n\r\n[142] _History of Canada_, p. 370.\r\n\r\n[143] _Ante_, p. 100.\r\n\r\n[144] _Ante_, p. 101.\r\n\r\n[145] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[146] _The Hamilton Outrage_, by \"Vindex,\" p. 9.

On one side was\r\nthe old High Tory or Family Compact party, who revelled in the spoils of\r\noffice, and held the representative of Majesty in the hollow of their\r\nhands. The policy of this body was unchanged and unchangeable. The\r\nReform party, though it had not been in existence more than six years,\r\nalready began to show symptoms of want of cohesion. The men of moderate\r\nviews, like the Rolphs, the Baldwins and the Bidwells, composed fully\r\ntwo-thirds of the entire number. The ultra-Radicals, composed for the\r\nmost part of unlettered farmers and recently-arrived immigrants, began\r\nto show evidence of a desire to rally themselves under the banner of\r\nMackenzie, who, through the combined influence of his paper and his\r\nelection to Parliament, had of late come prominently before the public.\r\nA large and intelligent body of electors had however grown up within the\r\nlast few years who, while they professed Conservative principles, were\r\ndisgusted with the greedy, self-seeking Compact, whose practices they\r\nheld in utter disdain. They held politicians of the Mackenzie stamp in\r\nstill greater abhorrence, to which was added a large modicum of\r\ncontempt. With the moderate Reformers, on the other hand, they had much\r\nin common. Many of them approved of the doctrine of Responsible\r\nGovernment, and almost all of them desired to see the end of Compact\r\ndomination. At the last general election their votes had been very much\r\ndivided. But they were now disposed to hold aloof from the Reformers in\r\nconsequence of the latter's being nominally of the same party as the\r\nMackenzie Radicals, who had only recently come into existence. The\r\nexercise of a little diplomacy and mutual forbearance at this time\r\nmight, it is believed, have effected that union between these two\r\nclasses of persons which was actually accomplished about a quarter of a\r\ncentury later. Such an union would have made the united party all\r\npowerful. It would have swept away the Compact, together with the\r\nlong-standing abuses which had grown up under their rule, and the united\r\nparty would quietly have assumed the reins of power with an overwhelming\r\nmajority at its back. There would thus have been no _raison d'etre_ for\r\nthe Radical element, which would necessarily have been absorbed, or\r\nwould at least have ceased to be an important factor in political life.\r\n\r\nThese things, however, were not to be. Neither of the parties primarily\r\ninterested made any advances to the other, and each was left to pursue\r\nits own line of policy. As a consequence the moderate Conservatives\r\nhenceforth voted as one man. They saw the Radical element assuming an\r\nimportance which, as they believed, was fraught with far greater danger\r\nto the commonwealth than was likely to arise from the continued\r\nascendency of the Compact. They gave the official party a qualified\r\nsupport, merely because they regarded them as the less of two evils, and\r\ntheir votes at the general election of 1830 resulted in the return of a\r\nconsiderable majority of candidates favourable to the official body.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1831.]\r\n\r\nThe Reformers could no longer hope to obtain justice, even in the\r\nAssembly, where they had exerted a predominating influence during the\r\nlast two Parliaments. So long as they had had control of the Lower House\r\nthey had possessed the shadow of power without the reality. Even the\r\nshadow had been better than nothing; but of this shadow they were\r\nhenceforth to be deprived. They had not only sustained numerical defeat.\r\nSome of their most trusted leaders had been beaten at the polls, and\r\nwere no longer able to raise their voices in Parliament. Robert\r\nBaldwin's defeat in York has already been mentioned.[148] His father had\r\nsuffered a similar fate in Norfolk. In Middlesex John Rolph and Captain\r\nMatthews had been succeeded by Colonel Mahlon Burwell and another\r\nadherent of the Compact. Lennox and Addington had again returned Bidwell\r\nand Perry, but, owing to the changed complexion of the House, there was\r\nno possibility of the former's re-election to the Speaker's chair. Among\r\nother triumphs scored by the official party were the return of the\r\nSolicitor-General, Christopher A. Hagerman, for Kingston; of the\r\nAttorney-General, H. J. Boulton, for Niagara; of William B. Robinson\r\n(brother of the Chief Justice) for Simcoe, and of Allan N. MacNab for\r\nWentworth. York still remained true to Mackenzie, and, as will presently\r\nbe seen, his presence in a House composed mainly of political opponents\r\nwas destined to lead to serious complications. Upon the assembling of\r\nthe Legislature early in the following year, Archibald McLean, the\r\nofficial candidate for the Speakership, was elected by a majority of\r\ntwelve votes. No adherent of the official party could have been more\r\nacceptable to the Reformers than Mr. McLean, who was a gentleman of high\r\nstanding at the bar, and who personally enjoyed great popularity. He sat\r\nfor the County of Stormont, which he had represented for many years,\r\nduring all of which period he had maintained friendly personal relations\r\nwith the members of the Opposition. Great confidence was felt in his\r\npersonal integrity, and in his earnestness for the country's welfare. He\r\nhad special claims to consideration, for he was a Canadian by birth, and\r\nhad fought and bled in defence of his native land during the War of\r\n1812. Still, he represented political principles which the Reform\r\nmembers had been expressly returned to combat, and the mere fact of his\r\nelection to the Speaker's Chair by a majority of twelve votes in a House\r\nwhich numbered fewer than fifty members was in itself a sufficient\r\nindication that those principles were for the time unmistakably in the\r\nascendant in Upper Canada. The proceedings of the House during the\r\nsession furnished an apt and conclusive commentary upon this fact.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1831 was chiefly memorable for two things: the passing of\r\nthe Everlasting Salary Bill, as it was called by those opposed to it;\r\nand the commencement of the agitation which had for its object the\r\nexclusion of Mr. Mackenzie from the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe Salary Bill was simply a measure granting to the Provincial\r\nGovernment a permanent Civil List, in return for the cession by the\r\nCrown of the control of the Imperial duties. It was introduced in\r\naccordance with a suggestion from the King, but the Provincial\r\nExecutive concealed certain facts in connection with it, of which the\r\nOpposition did not become aware until some time afterwards.[149]\r\n\r\nBy this Bill provision was made for the salaries of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, the three Judges of the Court of King's Bench, the\r\nAttorney-General, the Solicitor-General, five Executive Councillors, and\r\nthe Clerk of the Executive Council. Reformers were strenuously opposed\r\nto the measure, which they regarded as another blow at the\r\nconstitutional rights of the Assembly. It of course had the effect of\r\nrendering the Executive more independent of the Assembly, and more\r\nindifferent to its opposition, than ever. Hagerman and Boulton, whose\r\nofficial salaries were thereby provided for, were conspicuous above all\r\nother persons in the House in defending this measure, and in browbeating\r\nthose who ventured to raise their voices against it. The Reform members\r\nfound Attorney-General Boulton an infliction specially hard to bear. His\r\npredecessor, Mr. Robinson, had been a sufficiently galling yoke, but his\r\nabilities had made him respected, and he had seldom attempted to play\r\nthe bully. In cases where no important party interests were at stake he\r\nhad generally been amenable to reason, and had not gone out of his way\r\nto needlessly exacerbate the feelings of those who disagreed with him.\r\nNow, a different order of things prevailed. Boulton was simply\r\nunendurable. His capacity was barely such as to enable him to discharge\r\nhis official functions, and what he lacked in ability he made up for in\r\nbluster. He had an abominable temper, and a haughty, overbearing manner.\r\nHe was always committing blunders which he refused to acknowledge, and\r\nhe roared and bullied his way through one complication after another\r\nin a fashion which disgusted even those with whom he acted. During the\r\ndiscussion on the Salary Bill he shrieked and raved himself hoarse in\r\ndenouncing what he called the \"factious insolence\" of the Opposition. Of\r\nhis own factious insolence he seems to have been altogether oblivious.\r\nThe Bill was passed, but he was not destined to a long enjoyment of the\r\nprovision thereby made for the Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nThe Mackenzie persecution was a matter of greater moment than the Salary\r\nBill, and was fated to produce results altogether unexpected by those\r\nwho set it on foot. The session was not many days old when Mr. Mackenzie\r\nonce more began to make himself conspicuous in Opposition. He moved a\r\nresolution denying the authority of the Executive to prescribe the\r\nreligious observances of the Assembly, and affirming the right of the\r\nlatter body to appoint its own chaplain. He made a forcible but\r\nexasperating speech in support of his motion, which, by vote of the\r\nHouse, was not submitted. He then moved that the ministers of religion\r\nof various denominations resident in York should be requested to say\r\nprayers in the House during the session. This motion was equally\r\nunsuccessful. During the debate, the Assembly was favoured with a\r\ncharacteristic specimen of Attorney-General Boulton's oratory. He\r\nstigmatized the assumption that the House was entitled to appoint its\r\nown chaplain as of a piece with the assumption of an assassin that he\r\nhas a right to shoot down a man in the street--the right of brute force.\r\nThis nonsensical tirade he shrieked out by way of peroration to a speech\r\nintended as a defence of the right of the Government in the matter of\r\nthe chaplaincy. It is strange that the House should have listened to\r\nsuch balderdash, not only with patience, but even with apparent\r\nsubmission. Solicitor-General Hagerman spoke in a similar strain, but\r\nwith less of irascibility. He warned the House that the Government was\r\ntoo powerful for them; that the Lieutenant-Governor had strong feelings\r\non this subject, and that if they persisted in opposing his wishes\r\nconfusion would ensue, and an end would be put to their proceedings.\r\n\r\nBut Mackenzie was not to be dismayed by the want of success of his\r\nexertions to popularize the religious ceremonial of the Assembly. He\r\nnext moved for an inquiry into the state of the representation. Such an\r\ninquiry was urgently needed, for the House was full of postmasters,\r\ncounty registrars, inspectors of licenses, and other placemen who held\r\noffice at the will of the Executive, and who therefore could not be\r\nexpected to be honest exponents of public opinion in their respective\r\nconstituencies. Mackenzie, in the course of a vigorous speech, presented\r\nsuch an array of facts that a committee of inquiry was appointed. This\r\nsuccess he followed up by a motion for an inquiry into certain pensions,\r\nfees and salaries. Then he instituted a crusade against the management\r\nof the Bank of Upper Canada, of which institution Attorney-General\r\nBoulton was solicitor. Each of these motions afforded opportunities for\r\ninflammatory speeches, in the course of which the Government and its\r\nofficial favourites were handled with scant consideration. The\r\nAttorney-General was several times lashed into a state of almost insane\r\nfury, and on one occasion seemed to be on the point of rushing across\r\nthe floor and making a personal onslaught upon Mr. Mackenzie. The\r\n\"little mannikin from York,\" as he was called, always had the courage of\r\nhis opinions, and rather courted such an attack than otherwise. That he\r\nhad many and grave faults cannot be denied, but certainly cowardice was\r\nnot among the number. No more certain means of intensifying his\r\nopposition could have been found than an attempt to put him down by the\r\nstrong hand. He continued to make motion upon motion and speech upon\r\nspeech, and before the session was half over he had managed to cause an\r\namount of annoyance to the Government such as they had never before\r\nknown. And all this time the party to which he belonged was in an\r\ninsignificant minority in the Assembly. What then was to be anticipated\r\nwhen the chances and changes of time should once more place that party\r\nin the ascendant there?\r\n\r\nIn former times it had been possible for the official party to rid\r\nthemselves of a troublesome opponent upon any slight pretext. Why not\r\nnow, when the Assembly was well-nigh as obedient as the Upper House, and\r\nwhen some of the ablest members of the Reform party had ceased to occupy\r\nthemselves with public affairs? Certainly there had never been a time\r\nwhen suppression was more imperatively required, for did not this man\r\nMackenzie spout something very much like democracy in their very faces?\r\nHad he not made several speeches in the House which had aroused a\r\nspirit of inquiry? If he were allowed to continue, was it not inevitable\r\nthat some of his waspish stings must take serious effect?\r\n\r\nProsecutions for libel had become unpopular. The case of Francis Collins\r\nhad aroused such a clamour that it was not deemed wise to try further\r\nexperiments in that direction. In April, 1828--about the same time when\r\nmeasures had been instituted against Collins--an indictment for libel\r\nhad actually been laid against Mackenzie for a paragraph published in\r\nthe _Advocate_, in which the Crown lawyers and other supporters of the\r\nGovernment had been referred to in contumelious terms, and wherein a\r\nhope had been expressed that the constituencies returning certain Tory\r\nmembers to Parliament would clear the Assembly of \"the whole of that\r\nominous nest of unclean birds.\"[150] But the Attorney-General, after\r\nkeeping the prosecution impending over the defendant's head for many\r\nmonths, had seen fit to abandon it. The times, in fact, had ceased to be\r\npropitious for libel prosecutions, and some other way out of the\r\ndifficulty had to be found. The device actually hit upon to get rid of\r\nMackenzie's opposition in the Assembly was worthy of the minds which had\r\nplotted the ruin of Captain Matthews, Justice Willis and Francis\r\nCollins. Mackenzie, who had the contract for printing the journals of\r\nthe House, and who generally had a number of copies of those journals on\r\nhand, had distributed a hundred and sixty-eight of them throughout some\r\nof the constituencies just prior to the last general election. This had\r\nbeen done at his own expense, and in the interest of the Reform\r\ncandidates; for he believed that no more effective campaign document\r\ncould be devised than a truthful record of the proceedings in the House.\r\nBut as strict matter of Parliamentary law he had been guilty of a breach\r\nof privilege, no one having a right to publish reports of the\r\nproceedings of the Houses without authority. The existence of such a\r\nrule is perhaps salutary, as there are conceivable cases in which it\r\nwould be inexpedient to allow such publication. But, as everybody knew,\r\nParliament had long been accustomed to wink at perpetual violations of\r\nthis rule. Newspapers all over the world had been permitted, and even\r\nencouraged, to transgress it. Some of the leading organs of public\r\nopinion in different parts of the world had built up their reputations\r\nmainly by the fulness and accuracy of their reports of Parliamentary\r\nproceedings. Nothing can be more certain than that there would have been\r\nno talk about enforcing the obsolete rule at this time but for the fact\r\nthat it seemed to afford a pretext for punishing the man whom the\r\nGovernment party wished to destroy. The attempt to enforce it was not a\r\nsuccess. The motion to that end was made by Allan MacNab, and was to the\r\neffect that Mackenzie had abused the trust reposed in him as the printer\r\nof the journals, by distributing portions of the same for political\r\npurposes, and among persons not entitled to copies thereof, thereby\r\ncommitting a breach of the privileges of the House. The junior member\r\nfor Wentworth thundered with tremendous vehemence in support of his\r\nmotion. To judge from his language, his soul had been stirred to its\r\nnethermost depths by this lamentable violation of Parliamentary\r\nprivilege, which he characterized as a species of treason. Hagerman and\r\nBoulton followed in the same strain, the latter waxing almost pathetic\r\nin his expressions of devotion to the British constitution. But their\r\nexertions were ineffectual. The House, subservient though it was, was\r\nnot to be coerced into supporting a motion which, if carried, would\r\nalmost certainly be converted into a basis of attack on persons who were\r\nfavourable to the Administration. A majority of the members foresaw that\r\nif Mackenzie were punished on such a pretext, his fellow-workers in the\r\nAssembly would not fail to institute measures against the publishers of\r\nvarious newspapers throughout the land who had been in the constant\r\nhabit of reporting the proceedings in Parliament without leave. Only\r\nfifteen members voted for MacNab's motion, while twenty recorded their\r\nvotes against it, and among the latter were several of the most\r\nredoubtable Tories in the House. The organizers of the attack perceived\r\nthat they had made a false move, and withdrew their forces for a fresh\r\nassault in a different quarter.\r\n\r\nThe opportunity for a fresh attack did not present itself until the\r\nfollowing session. Meanwhile, Mackenzie occupied himself in turning his\r\nnotoriety to account, and in developing his policy of agitation. He\r\nresolved upon getting up a series of petitions to the King and the\r\nImperial Parliament, calling attention to the various grievances\r\nwherewith the inhabitants of the Province were burdened, and praying\r\nfor redress. During the summer he carried out his project by organizing\r\na series of public meetings in some of the most populous cities and\r\ntowns of the Province, at each of which a petition was adopted and\r\nnumerously signed. It is said that the aggregate number of signatures\r\nobtained exceeded 24,500. The agitator's success encouraged him to\r\npersevere in the course he had adopted, and when Parliament re-assembled\r\nin November he was ripe and ready for the fray that was sure to follow.\r\nThe assault against him now took the shape of a charge of gross,\r\nscandalous and malicious libel, intended and calculated to bring the\r\nHouse and the Government of the Province into contempt, and to excite\r\ngroundless suspicion and distrust in the minds of the inhabitants,\r\nthereby constituting a breach of privilege. The matter complained of was\r\nembodied in two articles published in the _Advocate_ subsequent to the\r\nopening of the session, and both publication and authorship were\r\nadmitted by Mackenzie. One of the articles was a sharp criticism on the\r\nmanner in which the House had treated a petition from certain\r\ninhabitants of Vaughan. The other was a well-merited tirade against the\r\nlocal Executive, which was unfavourably contrasted with that of the\r\nsister Province. Neither of them was grossly abusive, nor even unfair.\r\nThey were indeed exceptionally favourable specimens of the Mackenzie\r\nstyle of journalism, and were incomparably milder than articles which\r\nmay constantly be seen in the Canadian party journals of the present\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBeing called upon for his defence, Mackenzie addressed the House with\r\nmore than his wonted ability. He exposed the flimsiness of the charges\r\nagainst him, and the gross partiality of the proceedings. But the House\r\nwas in search, not of justice, but of a victim, and neither the\r\neloquence of a Demosthenes nor the reasoning powers of a Pascal would\r\nhave availed aught with that hostile majority. Attorney-General Boulton,\r\nin the course of the discussion, delivered himself of a tempest of\r\ncharacteristic abuse against the accused, to whom he referred as a\r\nreptile. Solicitor-General Hagerman could always be depended upon as a\r\ngood second in such emergencies, and followed up by referring to Mr.\r\nMackenzie as a spaniel dog. The House seemed to accept these choice\r\nParliamentary epithets with approval. They came from an official\r\nsource, and it is so easy to be strong upon the stronger side. Little\r\nchance was there for the maimed and bleeding under dog in the fight\r\namong that crowd of venal and merciless sycophants, some of whom had\r\nlibelled the late Assembly in terms thrice as gross as any that had been\r\nemployed in the articles in question. The _tu quoque_ argument is not\r\ngenerally admissible in legal investigations, but surely it might have\r\nbeen permitted to have some weight with the judges--who were likewise\r\nthe jurors--in this case. Neither that nor any argument appears to have\r\nbeen seriously considered. The usual forms were gone through, in order\r\nto preserve some appearance of conventional propriety, but a verdict of\r\nguilty was altogether certain and beyond peradventure from the moment\r\nwhen the indictment was laid. By a vote of twenty-seven to fifteen it\r\nwas resolved that Mackenzie was guilty of the libel charged against him.\r\nBy a vote of twenty-six to fourteen it was resolved that he was guilty\r\nof a high breach of the privileges of the House. And by a vote of\r\ntwenty-four to fifteen, it was resolved that he be expelled therefrom.\r\n\r\nTo characterize these proceedings as a series of shameful abuses of\r\npower is certainly not to exceed the bounds of moderation. The persons\r\nresponsible for them must stand tainted at the bar of history for all\r\ntime to come. It is far from desirable to perpetuate the bitterness of\r\nthe past, but it is possible for oblivion to be too charitable. It is\r\nwell that those who are accustomed to speak of \"the rebels\" of 1837 with\r\ncontumely and indignation should bear in mind against whom and what it\r\nwas that they rebelled. The expulsion of Mackenzie from the Assembly was\r\nnot the greatest act of tyranny to which the people of Upper Canada were\r\ncompelled to submit in the far-away days that are gone; but the nature\r\nof the abuse was such that it awoke widespread alarm, and gave rise to\r\nominous forebodings. It indicated that constitutional opposition to the\r\nGovernment was no longer safe in the Assembly, as it had been during the\r\ntwo preceding Parliaments. It indicated that nothing approaching to a\r\nfair trial was to be had, even from the High Court of Parliament, for a\r\npolitician who dared to criticize the official methods of transacting\r\nthe public business. Growls of discontent were heard from all over the\r\nCounty of York, whose representative was treated with such ignominy.\r\nPeople were heard to express an opinion that Upper Canada was no longer\r\na fit place of abode for free men and women.\r\n\r\nThe public indignation found expression in several petitions, addressed\r\nto the Lieutenant-Governor by electors in York and elsewhere, in which\r\nhis Excellency was asked to \"dismiss a House tainted with the worst\r\nvices of judicial partiality.\" A deputation, consisting of more than\r\nnine hundred persons, called at Government House to present one of these\r\nmanifestations of popular sentiment. His Excellency could not well\r\nrefuse to receive a respectfully-worded petition, but his reply was so\r\ncurt and unsatisfactory as to amount to positive insolence. \"Gentlemen,\"\r\nsaid he, \"I have received the petition of the inhabitants.\" And with\r\nthis wholly unnecessary item of information the deputation was compelled\r\nto withdraw. So utter a disregard for the expression of the opinion of a\r\nconsiderable body of the inhabitants was without precedent in the annals\r\nof the Province. That the prayer of the petition would be granted, or\r\neven that it would be taken into serious consideration, was hardly to be\r\nexpected. Its very nature forbade any such expectation. But, considering\r\nthe number of names appended to it, it certainly merited a serious\r\nresponse, in which light the actual rejoinder could not be regarded. The\r\nproceeding showed not merely indifference, but contempt; and\r\nthenceforward Sir John Colborne was as cordially hated by the Reformers\r\nof Upper Canada as ever Sir Peregrine Maitland had been.[151]\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the faction to ruin and humiliate Mackenzie had the\r\neffect which such treatment always produces in communities where the\r\ninhabitants have been indoctrinated with ideas of fair play and equal\r\nrights. It made a popular hero of one who, if the truth must be told,\r\nhad very little of the heroic in his composition. Had the Government\r\nbeen wise enough in their own interests to let him have his say in the\r\nAssembly, he would soon have found his proper level, and would have\r\nceased to carry any weight there.[152] He would undoubtedly have raised\r\na good deal of temporary excitement by unearthing abuses, and by\r\nvituperating persons whom he disliked. But he could never have seriously\r\nthreatened the supremacy of the Compact, for the very sufficient reason\r\nthat he could not command the sympathies or respect of the leading\r\nspirits of his own party. Rolph, the Bidwells and the Baldwins had by\r\nthis time come to rate Mackenzie at about his true value. They\r\nrecognized his talents, which were many and considerable. He had a clear\r\nhead for accounts, and was full of suggestive ideas about matters of\r\nfinance. Some of these ideas were unpractical, and even chimerical, but\r\nanyone capable of separating the wheat from the chaff could learn much\r\nfrom him, and could render his suggestions available. He was an\r\nexcellent subordinate, useful on committees, and active in the\r\nmanagement of details. He also had his uses as the conductor of a public\r\npress, though, owing to the erratic and ill-balanced mind of its editor,\r\nthe _Advocate_ was in some respects a source of weakness rather than of\r\nstrength. His influence was pretty much confined to the farmers and\r\nmechanics of that portion of the country where his paper was chiefly\r\ncirculated; and even there his influence would never have been anything\r\nlike so great as it actually became had it not been for the persecution\r\nto which he was subjected. Over and beyond, he could not be said to\r\nhave any distinctive _locus standi_ in the Reform party. Of\r\nstatesmanship, properly so called, he had nothing beyond the most misty\r\nconception. The structure of his mind prevented him from seeing a\r\nquestion in its various aspects, and in judging of future political\r\nevents he was much more often wrong than right. That he was honestly\r\ndesirous of advancing the cause which he had espoused there seemed no\r\ngood reason to doubt, but it was evident to those who were brought into\r\nintimate relations with him that the fiery zeal which he displayed was\r\nmade up at least as much of hatred of his foes as of any overpowering\r\nenthusiasm for Reform. Another quality which seriously interfered with\r\nhis usefulness was his exceeding want of discretion. He seemed to be\r\nutterly incapable of keeping his own counsel, and a secret once told to\r\nhim was a secret no longer. His rashness and impetuosity were\r\nproverbial, and were perpetually involving him in disputes, not only\r\nwith enemies but with friends.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1832.]\r\n\r\nIt was surely a short-sighted policy which gave to a man so constituted\r\na factitious importance, and which made him for some years the most\r\nnotorious personage in Upper Canada. The treatment he had received\r\naroused popular sympathy on his behalf, and preparations were made to\r\nreturn him again for the County of York by an increased majority. When\r\nthe new election was held, on the 2nd of January in the following year,\r\na long procession of sleighs escorted him to the polling-place, which\r\nwas the Red Lion Tavern, on Yonge Street. Two thousand persons assembled\r\nto witness the triumph of \"the people's friend.\" An Oppositionist was\r\nnominated, but as he received only one vote during the hour and a half\r\nwhich elapsed after the opening of the poll, he abandoned the contest,\r\nand Mackenzie's triumph was assured. The close of the poll was followed\r\nby the presentation of a gold medal by his constituents, as a token of\r\ntheir approbation. A number of sleighs were then formed in line and\r\nparaded down Yonge Street, and thence past Government House and down to\r\nthe Parliament Buildings. The foremost sleigh was decorated with\r\nenthusiastic mottoes painted on calico, and cheers for the successful\r\ncandidate rent the air as the procession passed along the principal\r\nthoroughfares. All this popular adulation was grateful to Mackenzie's\r\nsoul. He was in his element. There is no need to linger over this part\r\nof the narrative. Parliament was still in session, and the Assembly were\r\nresolved that, no matter what the electors of York might think proper to\r\ndo, Mackenzie should not sit in the House. A new pretext for his\r\nexpulsion was found in an article of which he avowed himself to be the\r\nauthor, and which appeared in the _Advocate_ of the 5th of January. This\r\narticle was a true and by no means intemperate recital of certain\r\nwell-known facts as to certain measures which had been passed by the\r\nAssembly. It was notwithstanding adjudged, by a vote of twenty-seven to\r\nnineteen, to be a libel on the House, and a high breach of its\r\nprivileges; and it was further resolved that Mr. Mackenzie be expelled\r\nthe House, and declared unfit and unworthy to hold a seat therein during\r\nthe existing Parliament. But his constituency stood loyally by him, and\r\nagain re-elected him by an overwhelming majority within a few weeks\r\nafter this second expulsion. His popularity reached a higher point than\r\never. Public meetings were held all over the Province to protest against\r\nthe measures which had been adopted towards him, and petitions to the\r\nKing and the Imperial Parliament were again circulated and signed by\r\ngreat numbers of the inhabitants. These meetings proved so successful\r\nthat the Government party deemed it wise to take some steps of a similar\r\ncharacter on their own behalf, with a view to checkmating the operations\r\nof the Reformers. Nothing is more easy than to obtain signatures to\r\npetitions, which are frequently signed without being read. Opposition\r\nmeetings were held by supporters of the Government, at which excuses\r\nwere attempted to be made for the expulsions of Mackenzie, and at which\r\ncounter petitions to the King and Parliament of Great Britain were\r\nsigned by many thousands of persons. One of the meetings was held at\r\nHamilton on the 19th of March, and Mackenzie attended it by special\r\ninvitation. That same night an attack was made upon him by certain\r\nmyrmidons of the official party, who kicked and beat him severely. At\r\nanother meeting held at York four days later the proceedings became so\r\nriotous that the Sheriff professed himself unable to preserve the peace.\r\nAn attack was made upon the office of the _Advocate_, the windows of\r\nwhich were broken. The town remained in a very disturbed state\r\nthroughout the ensuing night, and a large proportion of the inhabitants\r\ndid not venture to seek repose. Mackenzie deemed it prudent to retire\r\ninto the country for several weeks; and almost immediately after his\r\nreturn to town he set off on an important mission to England. It was\r\nconsidered that the most effectual method of impressing the\r\nsubject-matter of the various Reform petitions upon those to whom they\r\nwere addressed would he to send Mackenzie himself across the Atlantic to\r\npresent them, and to urge the many much-needed colonial reforms upon the\r\nattention of members of the British House of Commons. It was believed\r\nthat he could accomplish the various objects of his mission and return\r\nin time to take his seat in the Assembly at its opening towards the\r\nclose of the year. He deputed the editing and publication of the\r\n_Advocate_ to other hands, and sailed from New York on the 1st of May.\r\nIn due course he reached his destination, and put himself into\r\ncommunication with Hume, Roebuck, Cobbett, O'Connell, and other eminent\r\npersons of Liberal proclivities, including Lord Goderich, the Colonial\r\nSecretary.\r\n\r\nThe reader hardly needs to be informed that this was a momentous period\r\nin the history of England. It was the epoch of Reform, and the nation\r\nwas in a state of ferment. During the brief space while Mackenzie had\r\nbeen crossing the Atlantic great events had taken place. Earl Grey's\r\nministry had resigned; Sir Robert Peel had refused to join the Duke of\r\nWellington in an attempt to form a Government; and Earl Grey had resumed\r\noffice, armed with the King's written authority to Lord Brougham and\r\nhimself to create as many peers as might be necessary to ensure the\r\npassing of the Reform Bill. This authority it did not become necessary\r\nto exercise. The titled aristocracy bowed to the unconquerable will of a\r\ngreat and thoroughly-aroused people, and Mackenzie reached London in\r\ntime to hear the third reading of the Great Bill in the House of Lords.\r\nHe was soon afterwards received at the Colonial Office, not as the\r\nrepresentative of any particular class of Canadian politicians, but as a\r\nperson interested in Canadian affairs, and able to afford much valuable\r\ninformation concerning them.[153] He then found that the efforts of the\r\nofficial party in Upper Canada to render his mission inoperative had not\r\nbeen barren of results. Petitions had been received at the Colonial\r\nOffice in which entire satisfaction was expressed with the existing laws\r\nand institutions of the Province; and the signatures thereto slightly\r\nexceeded in number those appended to the petitions of which he himself\r\nhad been the bearer. He however devoted himself with characteristic\r\nenergy to the presentation of his case, and prepared a memoir wherein\r\nall the most serious grievances of the Upper Canadian people were set\r\nforth in detail. In this document the writer adopted a discursive and\r\nrhetorical style which, as the Colonial Secretary justly remarked, were\r\n\"singularly ill adapted to bring questions of so much intricacy and\r\nimportance to a definite issue.\" The facts were nevertheless pretty\r\ncomprehensively embodied, and were generally speaking of such a\r\ncharacter as to tell their own story. The perusal of the memoir seems to\r\nhave produced an impression upon the Colonial Secretary's mind. He wrote\r\na long and elaborate despatch to Sir John Colborne, in which the weak\r\npoints of Mackenzie's arguments were exposed with cutting severity, and\r\nwherein it was evident that very little weight had been attached to most\r\nof his representations; but at the same time certain concessions to\r\npopular opinion were plainly hinted at. When this despatch was submitted\r\nto the Legislative Council and Assembly of Upper Canada at the ensuing\r\nsession it was treated with scant respect. The Upper House formally\r\ndeclared that it did not regard it as calling for serious attention, and\r\nreturned it to the Lieutenant-Governor. The Assembly discussed the\r\npropriety of sending it back, but finally resolved not to do so. Both\r\nthe Crown Law Officers made hot-headed speeches on the subject, and\r\nreferred to the Colonial Secretary in the most contemptuous terms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Mackenzie, who still remained in England, was in his absence\r\nexpelled from the Assembly a third time. On this occasion there was no\r\npreliminary attempt to convict him of any fresh libel or breach of\r\nprivilege. The Law Officers of the Crown simplified the proceedings by\r\ndeclaring that the House had a right to determine as to the eligibility\r\nof members, and a resolution to that effect was moved and carried. It\r\nwas then resolved that the person returned for York was the same William\r\nLyon Mackenzie who had been twice expelled the House and declared unfit\r\nto hold a seat therein; and that by reason thereof the said Mackenzie\r\ncould not sit or vote in the House as a member thereof. He was then\r\nexpelled for the third time, and a new writ was issued for the County of\r\nYork. The inhabitants of that constituency felt so much aggrieved, and\r\ngave such loud-mouthed expression to their dissatisfaction, that no\r\ncandidate hostile to Mackenzie dared to present himself at the ensuing\r\nelection, and the choice of the people was returned by acclamation.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1833.]\r\n\r\nThe part taken by the Law Officers of the Crown in these repeated\r\nexpulsions was not acceptable to the Colonial Office. Neither was the\r\ncontemptuous manner in which they had seen fit to refer to the\r\nSecretary's despatch written after the perusal of Mackenzie's memoir. A\r\nmissive on the former subject had been sent to Sir John Colborne some\r\nmonths before the commencement of the session of 1832-3, the contents of\r\nwhich seem to have been promptly communicated to Messieurs Boulton and\r\nHagerman.[154] Notwithstanding that communication, those gentlemen had\r\nseen fit, soon after the opening of the session, to take a leading part\r\nin another expulsion, and to make contemptuous references to the conduct\r\nof the Colonial Secretary himself. The Attorney-General had expressed an\r\nopinion that the Secretary might have found something better to do than\r\nto sit down and answer \"Mackenzie's rigmarole trash.\" Solicitor-General\r\nHagerman had remarked that the Secretary had stultified himself by\r\nnoticing statements which rested on no better authority than that of a\r\nperson who had been twice expelled the Assembly, and who had been\r\ndeclared unfit to sit therein in consequence of his having \"fabricated\r\nand reiterated libels of the grossest description.\" Lord Goderich\r\nsignified his disapprobation of this conduct in the most emphatic manner\r\nby dismissing the two virulent critics from office. Their dismissal was\r\neffected by a despatch to Sir John Colborne dated March 6th, 1833. \"By\r\nthe accounts I have lately received of the proceedings of the\r\nLegislature of Upper Canada,\" wrote his Lordship, \"I have learnt that\r\nthe Attorney and Solicitor-General of that Province have, in their\r\nplaces in the Assembly, taken a part directly opposed to the avowed\r\npolicy of His Majesty's Government. As members of the Provincial\r\nParliament, Mr. Boulton and Mr. Hagerman are of course bound to act upon\r\ntheir own view of what is most for the interest of their constituents,\r\nand of the colony at large. But if, upon questions of great political\r\nimportance, they unfortunately differ in opinion from His Majesty's\r\nGovernment, it is obvious that they cannot continue to hold confidential\r\nsituations in His Majesty's service without either betraying their duty\r\nas members of the Legislature, or bringing the sincerity of the\r\nGovernment into question by their opposition to the policy which His\r\nMajesty has been advised to pursue.\" It was intimated that the Law\r\nOfficers of the Crown could not be permitted to impede the Government\r\npolicy, and that in order that those gentlemen might be at full liberty\r\nto follow their own judgment, they were to be relieved from their\r\noffices.[155]\r\n\r\nWhen this despatch reached York, towards the end of April, its contents\r\nwere communicated to Attorney-General Boulton. Mr. Hagerman had started\r\nfor England a short time before on a mission connected with the Clergy\r\nReserves, and, as was said,[156] in order to obtain a permanent\r\nappointment to a judgeship. He learned of his dismissal immediately upon\r\nhis arrival in London, and lost no time in putting himself in\r\ncommunication with the Colonial Minister. An important change had\r\nrecently taken place at the Colonial Office. Lord Goderich had vacated\r\nthe Secretaryship, and had become Lord Privy Seal, being at the same\r\ntime created Earl of Ripon. He was succeeded as Colonial Secretary by\r\nMr. Stanley, afterwards Earl of Derby, who had been Secretary for\r\nIreland, but had aroused such hostility against himself among\r\nO'Connell's followers by his stand on the Irish question[157] that it\r\nhad been deemed prudent to find another portfolio for him. He now\r\nadmitted Mr. Hagerman to an audience, and was so won upon by that\r\ngentleman's specious representations that he restored him to his\r\nstewardship. Accordingly, although he had been only moderately\r\nsuccessful in carrying out the specific objects of his mission, Mr.\r\nHagerman returned to Upper Canada in triumph; and he was greeted, upon\r\nhis arrival, with a tempest of acclamation from the Tory press.\r\n\r\nMr. Boulton, upon receiving from the Lieutenant-Governor's secretary an\r\nintimation of his dismissal, raised a howl of indignation against Lord\r\nGoderich and the Imperial Government generally. It was notorious that he\r\ncontrolled the columns of _The Upper Canada Courier_, a newspaper\r\npublished at York in the interests of the official party, and edited by\r\nMr. George Gurnett. That paper, in its next issue, contained an article\r\nmore scurrilous and abusive than had been either of those articles in\r\nthe _Advocate_ on the pretext whereof Mackenzie had been expelled from\r\nthe Assembly. It reeked with scurrility and disloyalty from beginning to\r\nend. It alleged that the well-affected people in the country were more\r\nthan half alienated from the Home Government, and that they began to\r\ncast about in their mind's eye for some new state of political\r\nexistence. There was more to the same purport. Some new state of\r\npolitical existence! This was a pretty strong suggestion of rebellion!\r\nAnd it emanated from the organ of a faction in whose mouths the word\r\n\"loyalty\" was ever present; whose \"loyalty\" had for years been vaunted\r\nfrom every hustings, and who, so long as the tide ran in their favour,\r\nhad preached doctrines worthy of the middle ages about submission to the\r\nhigher powers. How changed was the tone now that there seemed to be some\r\nprospect of their being placed upon the same footing, and judged by the\r\nsame standard as their neighbours. If they did these things in the green\r\ntree, what would they do in the dry? What might have been expected from\r\nthem if they had been subjected to such injustice and ignominy as the\r\nparty to which they were opposed? Here was a faction professedly ready\r\nto throw off their allegiance because two of their number had been\r\ndeprived of offices which they had notoriously prostituted and\r\ndisgraced.[158] Here was a \"well-affected\" people \"casting about\" in\r\ntheir \"mind's eye\" for a new state of political existence, because two\r\nof the most corrupt, brazen and audacious officials in the colony were\r\nno longer to be allowed to pervert legislation under the mantle of\r\nImperial countenance. And they were as little disposed to brook\r\ninterference with their pecuniary interests by the Colonial Office.\r\nEarly in the following year they gave utterance to rank treason in\r\nconsequence of the threatened disallowance by the Imperial Government of\r\ncertain Bank Charter Acts passed by the Provincial Parliament.[159] A\r\npearl is proverbially uncomely in the snout of a swine; and truly the\r\nword \"loyalty\" was never more absurdly out of place than when pronounced\r\nby such lips.\r\n\r\nThe ex-Attorney-General followed the ex-Solicitor-General to England,\r\nwhere he represented his case to the new Colonial Minister. After giving\r\nmuch attention to the matter, Mr. Stanley expressed himself as satisfied\r\nwith the explanations which had been offered. The explanations seem to\r\nhave chiefly consisted of solemn declarations on the part of Mr.\r\nBoulton that he had been insufficiently informed of the views of the\r\nHome Government, and that he had had no desire whatever to set up his\r\nown will in opposition to those views.[160] He doubtless professed his\r\nreadiness to go any length in the way of sycophancy which might be\r\nrequired of him for the future. It was however impossible to restore him\r\nto the Attorney-Generalship, as a successor to that office had been\r\nappointed in the person of Mr. Robert Sympson Jameson,[161] an English\r\nbarrister, who had actually sailed from Liverpool for Canada, and was\r\nalready well on his way thither. Mr. Boulton was informed that he should\r\nhave the first good appointment at the Secretary's disposal. His success\r\nwas even greater than that of his recent colleague, for on the 17th of\r\nJune he was notified that the King had been graciously pleased to accept\r\nof his further services, and that the Colonial Secretary had His\r\nMajesty's commands to offer him the appointment of Chief Justice of\r\nNewfoundland, which situation had recently become vacant.[162] This\r\nappointment was fully approved by the Earl of Ripon, under whose advice\r\nhe had been dismissed from the Attorney-Generalship of Upper\r\nCanada,[163] but who had been induced to change his views after hearing\r\nMr. Boulton's explanations.\r\n\r\nMr. Boulton's triumph, however, was to be followed by a downfall more\r\nhumiliating than that which he had so narrowly escaped. He repaired to\r\nNewfoundland in the autumn, and entered upon the performance of his\r\nduties. He had not been long in his new position before he had aroused a\r\nfeeling of disgust and alarm on the part of a large proportion of the\r\npublic and the profession. He began by being arbitrary, tyrannical and\r\nunjust. He proceeded from bad to worse, until it was found impossible to\r\npermit him to retain his position.[164] There is no need to follow the\r\nproceedings adopted against him. He was not finally got rid of until\r\n1838, when he returned to Upper Canada, and once more entered political\r\nlife as member for Niagara. The Home Government turned a deaf ear to his\r\nperpetual applications for employment, and would have nothing more to do\r\nwith him. Some years after the Union of the Provinces, finding that he\r\nhad nothing to hope for from the Conservative party, who refused to\r\nelevate him to a judgeship, he abandoned them, and for some time acted\r\nwith Mr. Baldwin. It seems almost cruel to record the fact that he\r\nsupported Responsible Government and the Rebellion Losses Bill.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[148] _Ante_, p. 229.\r\n\r\n[149] \"When, in the year 1831, His Majesty was graciously pleased to\r\nsuggest a further provision for the Civil List, which the Colonial\r\nMinistry required to be made either for seven years or for the life of\r\nHis Majesty, the terms of the proposition were not candidly submitted to\r\nthe Assembly, and notwithstanding the strenuous exertions of those who\r\ndesired to make no provision at variance with the spirit of our\r\nconstitution, the Executive influence in the Assembly succeeded in\r\ncarrying a measure for a permanent and extravagant supply, popularly\r\ncalled 'the Everlasting Salary Bill,' while the liberal and gracious\r\nterms proposed by His Majesty on the subject were concealed and known\r\nonly to those who, feeling themselves to be above responsibility,\r\nconsummated a measure which has spread universal dissatisfaction and\r\ndistrust. If this undue and impolitic concealment was practised from any\r\npretended apprehension that a just provision would not be made for His\r\nMajesty's Government by his faithful Commons, there is nothing in the\r\ncountry to justify it, and as it encroached upon the privileges of the\r\nLegislature there is no language of censure too strong against\r\nit.\"--_Seventh Report of Grievance Committee_, p. xlii.\r\n\r\n[150] See _The Colonial Advocate_ of April 3rd, 1828.\r\n\r\n[151] I can find no confirmation of the statement made by Mackenzie, and\r\nre-echoed by subsequent writers, about the excessive fears of the\r\nGovernment at this juncture, and the preparations made by them to resist\r\nan uprising of the people. There were no grounds for any such fears, nor\r\nfor any anticipations of an uprising. The people were long-suffering,\r\nand were by no means ripe for revolt.\r\n\r\n[152] If any evidence were needed of this obvious truth, it is furnished\r\nby Mackenzie's career in the Canadian Parliament after his return from\r\nexile. He was there brought into contact with politicians of a\r\nsucceeding generation, most of whom knew him by tradition only. His\r\nmisfortunes, and the manifold sufferings he had been compelled to\r\nendure, impelled most of the contemporaries to regard him with a large\r\nmeasure of forbearance, and he was permitted to indulge a license of\r\nspeech which would not have been tolerated in any other member. He\r\nadopted precisely the same _role_ as of yore, and delivered himself with\r\ngreat vehemence on matters which he did not understand. The inevitable\r\nresult was that the Assembly soon ceased to attach any weight to his\r\nopinions. He had lived long enough to repudiate many of his old\r\ndoctrines, and to eat many of his past words. His views on Tuesday were\r\nfrequently the very opposite to what they had been on Monday, and\r\nneither were any indication of what they would be on Wednesday. Members\r\nceased to attach any importance to his statements, or to think of them\r\nas calling for serious consideration. He came to be regarded as a sort\r\nof unlicensed jester who might be permitted to amuse the House by his\r\nantics when there was no pressing business on hand; but as to any real\r\ninfluence, he had no more than the junior messenger. It took him several\r\nyears to find this out, and when it was brought thoroughly home to him\r\nhe resigned his seat. Had the Family Compact politicians of fifty to\r\nsixty years ago been as wise in their generation as the members of the\r\nAssembly during the Fourth, Fifth and Sixth Parliaments of United\r\nCanada, they would have ceased to defend the indefensible, and would\r\nhave let Mackenzie alone. They might then have held the reins of power\r\nfor ten--or possibly twenty--years longer; but the day of reckoning,\r\nwhen it came, would probably have been a darker one.\r\n\r\n[153] Lord Howick, writing on behalf of the Colonial Secretary, under\r\ndate of June 23rd, 1832, in reply to Mackenzie's application for an\r\ninterview, informed the applicant that although the Secretary was ready\r\nto hear any observations which he (Mackenzie) might have to offer upon\r\nthe affairs of Upper Canada, as an individual interested in the welfare\r\nof that Province, and as a member of the Assembly, yet that the\r\nSecretary could not recognize him as being deputed to act for any other\r\nperson, nor could he enter into any discussion with him on measures\r\nwhich His Majesty's Government might think it right to pursue. \"The\r\nviews and intentions of His Majesty's Government with respect to the\r\naffairs of the Province,\" wrote his Lordship, \"can only be made known to\r\nthe people of Upper Canada through the medium of the Governor or of the\r\nLegislature; it is to one or other of these authorities that any\r\ncomplaints which individuals may have occasion to make should properly\r\nbe addressed; and if the course pursued by the Executive Government\r\nshould be such as to give just ground for dissatisfaction, the\r\ninhabitants have, by their Representatives, the means of bringing their\r\ngrievances under the immediate attention of His Majesty.\" The full text\r\nof the letter will be found on pp. 191, 192 of the _Seventh Report of\r\nGrievance Committee_.\r\n\r\n[154] Mr. Boulton denied, at least by implication, that any such\r\ncommunication had been made to him. See his letter dated April 30th,\r\n1833, and published in the _Courier_ of the following day. But it is\r\ncertain that the contents of the missive had been made known to Mr.\r\nHagerman, and it is hardly conceivable that he would have failed to\r\ncommunicate to his colleague matters of such vital importance to their\r\nwelfare.\r\n\r\n[155] The full text of the despatch will be found on p. 295 of the\r\n_Seventh Report of Grievance Committee_.\r\n\r\n[156] \"We have been very credibly informed that, on account of the\r\nextent of the settlements and consequent increase of court business, it\r\nwas thought expedient by our wise ones that a fourth judge was\r\nnecessary, and that he [Mr. Hagerman] had obtained (previous to his\r\nleaving here) a recommend from the other judges for himself to be\r\nappointed to the new created situation.\"--_Colonial Advocate_, Thursday,\r\nMay 2nd, 1833.\r\n\r\n\r\n[157] It was at this time that Mr. Stanley, by his fiery speech against\r\nO'Connell, won for himself the sobriquet of \"the Rupert of Debate.\"\r\n\r\n[158] Henry Sherwood, who had by this time attained to a prominent place\r\nin the ranks of the official party, was especially loud in his\r\ndenunciations of the British Government for dismissing Boulton and\r\nHagerman. According to a correspondent of the _Colonial Advocate_, he\r\ndeclared, in the course of an ordinary conversation, that if such\r\nproceedings were to continue, he, for his part, did not care how soon\r\nthe British authority was superseded by a republican one.--See letter of\r\n\"John Bull,\" on first page of the _Advocate_ of December 14th, 1833.\r\n\r\n[159] They were equally intolerant of opposition from their own\r\nadherents when their pecuniary interests were at stake. In December,\r\n1833, the Hon. John Elmsley, who had been called to the Executive\r\nCouncil three years before, was forced to resign his seat in that body\r\nbecause he could not act independently there. In his letter of\r\nresignation, which is dated \"Holland House, York, December 3rd, 1833,\"\r\nhe says: \"Since I have assumed the duties of that high office [_i.e._,\r\nthe office of an Executive Councillor], I find that I cannot fearlessly\r\nexpress my real sentiments and opinions, if opposed to the Government\r\nfor the time being, without incurring the risk of dismissal from that\r\nHonourable Board, which constitutes my inability to advance the public\r\ngood. I have therefore deemed it expedient most respectfully, but\r\nreluctantly, to tender the resignation of my seat in the Executive\r\nCouncil.\"--See evidence of the Hon. Peter Robinson, in Appendix to\r\n_Seventh Report on Grievance_, p. 91.

He was\r\nabsent in all nearly sixteen months, which was considerably longer than\r\nwas necessary for the accomplishment of the objects of his mission. He\r\ndoubtless enjoyed life in the metropolis, and was loth to relinquish\r\nit.[165] His mission had not been wholly fruitless, for his\r\nrepresentations at the Colonial Office had led to the writing of Lord\r\nGoderich's despatch already referred to, by which the faction in Upper\r\nCanada were led to see that they would for the future be compelled to\r\nact with somewhat more of circumspection. Several much-needed\r\nsuggestions were made in the despatch on subjects of practical\r\nimportance--among others as to the remuneration of members of the\r\nAssembly representing Town constituencies; as to the extension of the\r\nfranchise to persons who, by reason of their religious scruples, could\r\nnot conscientiously take the prescribed oath; as to the repeal of the\r\nlaw disqualifying British subjects from voting at elections till the\r\nexpiration of seven years after their return from a residence in a\r\nforeign country; and as to the interference of ecclesiastical\r\nLegislative Councillors in secular matters.[166] Mackenzie was also\r\nentitled to claim credit for obtaining important reforms in the\r\nmanagement of the Provincial Post Office. He had brought the affairs of\r\nthe Province conspicuously before the minds of several eminent public\r\nmen, whose interest in Canada had thus been aroused, and who were\r\nthenceforth able to display some familiarity with Canadian questions as\r\nthey came up for discussion in the House of Commons. During his stay in\r\nLondon he had published a duodecimo volume, extending to 504 pages,\r\nentitled \"Sketches in Canada and the United States,\" in which a good\r\nmany Provincial abuses had been specified. The information contained in\r\nthis work had been thrown together in a higgledy-piggledy fashion, and\r\nit could not be said to have much real value, more especially as many of\r\nits statements were inaccurate, and must have been known to be so when\r\nthey were written.[167] Still, it probably had some effect in seconding\r\nthe author's efforts to attract attention to himself and the interests\r\nwhich he represented. He had moreover acquainted the Colonial Secretary\r\nwith matters which could not possibly have been clearly explained\r\notherwise than orally. It was tolerably certain that information\r\nfurnished by him had led to the dismissal of Boulton and Hagerman, a\r\nproceeding which had wonderfully exhilarated his mind; and his\r\ndepression had been correspondently deep upon learning that the one had\r\nbeen promoted and the other reinstated. He had hoped to see Mr. Rolph\r\nappointed to the Solicitor-Generalship, and, if his word is to be\r\ncredited, he really seems to have had some grounds for believing that\r\nsuch an appointment would be made.[168] He afterwards declared that he\r\nhad \"good reasons for believing\" that Mr. Rolph's appointment had\r\nactually been made out and transmitted to Canada, but that Sir John\r\nColborne and Chief Justice Robinson had prevented it from taking\r\neffect.[169]\r\n\r\nAs has already been seen,[170] Mackenzie, during his absence in England,\r\nhad once more been elected to represent the County of York in the\r\nAssembly. Upon the first meeting of Parliament after his return he\r\npresented himself as a member. There was however a persistent\r\ndetermination that he should not be permitted to take his seat. The\r\nhostile majority in the House professed to believe that they had a right\r\nto exercise a discretion as to who should be permitted to sit therein.\r\nMackenzie, they alleged, had libelled the House by libelling a majority\r\nof its members, and he had neither made nor attempted to make any\r\nreparation or apology. The Clerk, acting most probably on instructions,\r\nrefused to administer the oath to him. A resolution was adopted that he\r\nshould not be permitted to sit or vote as a member during the session,\r\nand a writ for a new election was ordered. Again did he return to his\r\nconstituents, and again was he returned without opposition. The electors\r\nof York were by this time heartily tired of the farce, the perpetual\r\nre-enactment whereof had the effect of partly disfranchising them by\r\nleaving them with only one representative in the Assembly instead of\r\ntwo. They were nevertheless fully resolved not to yield their undoubted\r\nrights without some further assertion of them. The member of their\r\nchoice was under no legal disability. They were advised that there was\r\nno constitutional justification for the action of the Assembly. They\r\ndeclared that they owed it to themselves and those who were to come\r\nafter them not to submit tamely to injustice of such a nature. The\r\nelection being over, a considerable body of them escorted him to the\r\nHouses of Parliament. But a short time had elapsed since the last\r\nexpulsion, and the Legislature was still in session. The members of the\r\nAssembly stared in astonishment at the sudden and altogether\r\nunlooked-for incursion of strangers, who poured into the gallery and\r\ninto the space below the bar, where they were permitted to intrude\r\nthemselves, and where Mackenzie presented himself to take the oath.\r\nThose who could not find room inside remained without in the lobbies. In\r\na few moments a lull occurred in the proceedings of the House, whereupon\r\nburly Peter Perry rose in his place and announced that he had a petition\r\nto present on behalf of the inhabitants of the County of York. The\r\ncontents of the petition were not of a nature to render it acceptable to\r\na majority of the members. It referred to Mackenzie's expulsion, and\r\nprayed that that indignity might not be repeated. There was a very\r\ngeneral feeling among the supporters of the Government that the House\r\nought not to receive such a petition, and several of them gave utterance\r\nto their opinions on the subject. Allan MacNab expressed himself to this\r\neffect with his customary emphasis, and was greeted with a storm of\r\nhisses from the York electors in the gallery. Ominous sounds! The House\r\ncould not be expected to tamely brook such a manifestation, and an order\r\nwas given to clear the gallery. While the order was being obeyed, the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms approached Mackenzie where he stood below the bar, and\r\ndirected him to leave. Mackenzie replied to the effect that he had a\r\nright to be there, and that he intended to remain. The door was then\r\nopened by the Sergeant-at-Arms, who proceeded to eject Mackenzie by\r\nforce; but before he could carry out his purpose a rush was made from\r\nthe adjacent lobby. The door was promptly closed and barricaded, but not\r\nuntil several of the invaders had effected an entrance. The excitement\r\nwas intense, and for some minutes the proceedings of the House were\r\nsuspended. When quiet had been in some measure restored, the Speaker\r\ndirected the Sergeant-at-Arms to clear the space below the bar of\r\nstrangers. That functionary again ordered Mackenzie to leave, and he\r\nreceived the same reply as before. This was communicated to the Speaker,\r\nwho decided that, as Mackenzie had not taken the oath, he was not a\r\nmember of the House, and was not entitled to remain. Mackenzie was\r\nthere, ready and anxious to take the oath; but he was nevertheless\r\nremoved by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and the Assembly was once more purged\r\nof his presence. On the next day he was again formally expelled by a\r\nvote of the House[171]--an anomalous proceeding in view of the Speaker's\r\ndecision that he was not a member! He had thus been thrice expelled from\r\nthe House, and once excluded therefrom upon the ground that he was not a\r\nmember.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1834.]\r\n\r\nIt was by this time clear that from a House so constituted Mackenzie\r\ncould not expect to meet with fair play. Mr. Bidwell, Mr. Perry, and\r\nothers of his friends had all along spoken manfully on his behalf\r\nwhenever an opportunity of doing so had presented itself, but their\r\narguments had simply been thrown away. His pugnacious spirit was however\r\nfully aroused, and he determined to exhaust every means before\r\nabandoning his endeavours to take the seat to which he was entitled. He\r\napplied to the Lieutenant-Governor for permission to take the oath\r\nprescribed for members of the Legislature before his Excellency, or\r\nbefore some one specially appointed for the purpose, under the\r\ntwenty-ninth section of the Constitutional Act of 1791.[172] The\r\nquestion involved in this application was submitted to the\r\nAttorney-General, Mr. Jameson, who pronounced the opinion that Mackenzie\r\nwas entitled to the privilege asked for. The matter was nevertheless\r\nallowed to remain in abeyance for some weeks, as the hostile members of\r\nAssembly had been worked up to a great pitch of excitement by the\r\nincursion of the rural population, and were in no humour to tolerate\r\nMackenzie's presence. Meanwhile petitions to the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nwere sent in from various parts of the County of York, as well as from\r\nother places. The language in some of these was of the most unmistakable\r\nkind, and it was evident that endurance had nearly reached its limits.\r\nOn Monday, the 10th of February, Mackenzie, having taken the oath before\r\nthe Clerk of the Executive Council, and having obtained a duly attested\r\ncertificate of the ceremonial, ventured once more to present himself in\r\nthe Chamber of the Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe House was in Committee on the question of improving the navigation\r\nof the St. Lawrence when he entered. The gallery was crowded with\r\nspectators, most of whom were sympathizers with Mackenzie, and had\r\nassembled there to impart to him a sort of outside numerical support. He\r\nwalked to the seat which he had once been accustomed to occupy, and\r\nquietly sat down in it. Ere many minutes the Sergeant-at-Arms[173]\r\napproached and requested him to withdraw. This he declined to do,\r\nalleging that he was a member legally elected, duly sworn, and charged\r\nwith no offence or irregularity which could disqualify him from sitting\r\nand voting.[174] He produced the attested copy of the oath, and bade the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms interfere at his peril. The following is Mackenzie's\r\nown account of what ensued; and, unlike most of his narratives, it is in\r\nall substantial respects confirmed by several eye-witnesses. \"He [the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms] said he must use force, and he did so in as gentle a\r\nmanner as was consistent with the act. Although his proceedings were\r\nillegal, his whole conduct in carrying them into effect was marked by a\r\ndiscretion wisely adopted in the excited state of the minds of the dense\r\naudience by whom he was surrounded. I almost immediately returned to the\r\nseat I had occupied, and while on my way was seized hold of by Colonel\r\nFrazer, Collector of Customs at Brockville, and obliged to change my\r\nroute. Before I had got well seated, one of the members, I think Mr.\r\nBoulton[175] moved that the Speaker take the chair. He did so, and I\r\naddressed him, stating the insult I had received while in the\r\nperformance of my duty as a member. To this he made no reply, but said\r\nthat the Sergeant-at-Arms must know his duty. He then left the chair;\r\nthe Committee resumed, and I was a second time forced from my seat by\r\nviolent means. After a little reflection I decided to resume my seat;\r\nwas a third time forced from it by the Sergeant-at-Arms, and when the\r\nSpeaker had returned I was placed at the bar, charged by the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms with refusing to leave the House.\"[176] The\r\nSergeant-at-Arms then reported to the Speaker that he had taken into\r\ncustody William Lyon Mackenzie for disorderly conduct, and that he had\r\nhim in charge at the bar; whereupon it was moved by Mr. Samson, and\r\nseconded by Mr. Vankoughnet, member for Stormont, that William Lyon\r\nMackenzie, having been brought to the bar of the House by the\r\nSergeant-at-Arms for disorderly conduct, be called upon to state what he\r\nmight have to say in his defence. To this motion Mr. Perry moved an\r\namendment to the effect that Mackenzie was under no legal\r\ndisqualifications, and had a right to sit and vote in the House. Then\r\nfollowed a long debate which lasted nearly six hours,[177] and which\r\nleft the question at issue pretty nearly where it had been. Mr. Perry's\r\nmotion was lost by a vote of twenty-one to fifteen. A dense crowd\r\noccupied the gallery until far into the night, but good order was\r\npreserved, the only demonstration being a subdued hiss while Mr. William\r\nB. Robinson, member for Simcoe, and brother of the Chief Justice, was\r\nspeaking. Much rancour was exhibited by some of the Tory speakers,\r\nseveral of whom approved their loyalty by inveighing loudly against the\r\nLieutenant-Governor for permitting the Clerk of the Executive Council to\r\nadminister the oath to Mackenzie. Allan MacNab declared his intention to\r\nvote for committing Mackenzie to the common jail. Casting his eyes up to\r\nthe gallery, he scowled at the occupants, to whom he referred as a band\r\nof ruffians who had come there to intimidate the House. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor, he said, had interfered very improperly, and in a\r\nmanner no way creditable to himself. He had acted like the Vicar of\r\nBray, and might yet find, like that individual, that by taking both\r\nsides of a question he might fall through between. Mr. Samson, member\r\nfor Hastings, spoke to a similar purport, declaring himself to be in\r\nfavour of sending Mackenzie to jail without a hearing, and referring to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor in terms of strong censure. \"His Excellency,\"\r\nremarked Mr. Samson, \"knew perfectly well that Mr. Mackenzie had been\r\nexpelled by us, and for him to allow the oath to be administered under\r\nsuch circumstances was a most unwarrantable proceeding. He had no right\r\nwhatever to interfere. I do say he acted a most improper part, and I do\r\nnot know but this House ought to take it up.\" When Mackenzie attempted\r\nto speak at the bar, William Hamilton Merritt, member for Haldimand,\r\nrose in much anger, and exclaimed: \"Drown his voice. He ought to be put\r\nout of the House, and two men stationed continually at the door to keep\r\nhim out.\" Absalom Shade, of Galt, member for Halton, was of the same\r\nopinion. The speech of the member for Simcoe, which evoked the hiss from\r\nthe gallery as already mentioned, was perhaps the most violent of all.\r\nHe advocated that Mackenzie should be punished and consigned to jail\r\nwithout being allowed to utter \"one single word\" in defence of his\r\noutrageous proceedings. \"Mackenzie,\" said he, \"would never have dared to\r\nshow himself in this House again if he had not had his Excellency's\r\nsanction for doing so in his pocket. His Excellency's conduct, I\r\nmaintain, has been utterly unjustifiable. Indeed, I could not have\r\nbelieved it possible that his Excellency should have thought of taking\r\nsuch a step without consulting the Speaker of this House. He had no\r\nright whatever to do so, and now that he is told that we do not\r\nrecognize such a right on the part of the Executive, I trust he will not\r\npersevere.\"[178] For milder language than this, many of the Reformers\r\nhad been branded as \"traitors,\" \"disaffected,\" and \"republicans,\" by the\r\nvery person who now gave utterance to it. The beam in one's own eye is\r\nso much harder to perceive than the mote in the eye of one's brother.\r\n\r\nThe plain fact of the matter is, that no sentiment of either loyalty or\r\ndisloyalty had anything whatever to do with the treatment to which\r\nMackenzie was subjected at the hands of the Compact and their\r\nsupporters. It was simply this: Mackenzie was a thorn in their sides. He\r\nwatched them closely, and exposed their conduct in language which was\r\ntelling and vigorous, albeit often ill-considered and unbecoming. They\r\nfelt that their supremacy was menaced, and largely by his\r\ninstrumentality. His expulsions were due to a fixed determination to\r\nkeep him out of Parliament, irrespective not only of what was\r\nconstitutional or unconstitutional, but even of what was right or wrong.\r\nTo carry out this determination they resorted to all the party devices\r\nwhich a majority in the Assembly placed at their disposal. \"From first\r\nto last,\" as Mr. Lindsey remarks,[179] \"the proceedings against Mr.\r\nMackenzie were conceived in a party spirit, and carried by party votes.\r\nNo worse description or condemnation of them could be given, seeing\r\nthat they were in their nature judicial.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate, as has been said, came to nothing. Mackenzie was not\r\npermitted to take his seat, and did not again attempt to do so during\r\nthe session. No new writ was issued for the election of a member by the\r\nCounty of York. Mackenzie's supporters opposed the issue of a writ\r\nbecause such a proceeding would have assumed that the expulsion had been\r\nlegal, and that there was a legal vacancy in the representation. Others,\r\nwho were not friendly to Mackenzie, felt that a new election would only\r\nlead to fresh complications. York would undoubtedly return the expelled\r\nmember, and he would again be refused a seat in the House. The session\r\naccordingly dragged on to its close without any writ having been issued:\r\na matter of little practical importance, inasmuch as there was to be a\r\ngeneral election in the course of a few months. It will thus be seen\r\nthat the County of York underwent a partial disfranchisement for three\r\nyears, during which three sessions were held. Before another session\r\ncame round a new Parliament had come into being, and the political\r\nsituation had undergone a complete metamorphosis.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1833-4, which witnessed the tumultuous scene just\r\ndescribed, the Provincial Parliament made one important concession to\r\npublic opinion by passing an Act to render the Judges of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench independent of the Crown. It is right to state, however,\r\nthat this was done in consequence of pressure from the Imperial\r\nGovernment,[180] and not from any wish to remove an abuse of long\r\nstanding. The Act provided that \"the Judges of His Majesty's Court of\r\nKing's Bench for this Province shall hold their offices during their\r\ngood behaviour, notwithstanding the commissions which have been\r\nheretofore granted to them, or either of them, may specify that the\r\noffice is to be held during the pleasure of His Majesty; and that from\r\nand after the passing of this Act the commissions to the Judges of the\r\nsaid Court shall be made to them respectively to hold during their good\r\nbehaviour, and that the commissions of Judges of the said Court for the\r\ntime being shall be, continue, and remain in full force during their\r\ngood behaviour, notwithstanding the demise of His Majesty, or of any of\r\nhis heirs and successors.\" Thus were the Judiciary rendered independent\r\nof the humours of the Executive, whereby a long step was taken towards\r\nsecuring a pure administration of justice in the Superior Court of the\r\nProvince. Had a similar policy been pursued with respect to other gross\r\nabuses, the effect upon the public mind would have been most\r\npacificatory. Standing, as it did, alone, the Act exhibited a striking\r\ncontrast to every other feature of the Executive policy, and it may be\r\ndoubted whether a solitary inhabitant of the Province was conciliated\r\nthereby.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[165] Prior to his departure from Canada he travelled about here and\r\nthere through the country to collect subscriptions towards the expenses\r\nof his journey. He met with but slender success. After his return he\r\nmade further efforts in the same direction, and with similar results.\r\nPersons who professed much zeal for Reform were slow to put their hands\r\nin their pockets for such a purpose, and he succeeded in collecting only\r\nabout L150. It should however be remembered that most Upper Canadian\r\nReformers in those days were poor. Mackenzie's actual disbursements\r\nduring his absence are stated by Mr. Lindsey to have been L676 (_Life of\r\nMackenzie_, vol. i., p. 287), but a considerable part of this sum was\r\nexpended on a visit to Scotland. It is probable, too, that the amount\r\nstated includes the cost of publishing _Sketches in Canada and the\r\nUnited States_, which must have been considerable. It is fairly to be\r\ninferred from Mr. Lindsey's account that Mackenzie was himself compelled\r\nto pay the difference between L150, the amount collected from\r\nsubscribers, and L676, the amount actually expended. \"The people's\r\nagent,\" he informs us, \"was left to bear the greater part of the\r\nexpense.\" This, no doubt, was Mr. Lindsay's belief when his book was\r\nwritten; but nothing could be further from the fact. It would be much\r\nnearer the truth to say that Mackenzie enjoyed a sixteen months' holiday\r\nat the expense of his political friends, for all, or nearly all the\r\nmoney expended over and above the L150 was contributed by Dr. Morrison,\r\nDr. Rolph, David Gibson, the Lesslies, Shepards, and others; and as no\r\nportion of the money so contributed was ever repaid, they, and not\r\nMackenzie, were compelled to bear the loss. The implied slur upon the\r\nReform party is therefore wholly undeserved.\r\n\r\n[166] His Lordship expressed himself with much clearness on this\r\nsubject. \"Whether,\" he wrote, \"even under this restriction [_i.e._, the\r\nrestriction of non-interference in secular affairs], their holding such\r\nseats is really desirable, is a question upon which I am fully prepared\r\nto listen with the utmost attention to any advice which I may receive\r\nfrom yourself, from the House of Assembly, or from any other competent\r\nauthority. I have no solicitude for retaining either the Bishop\r\n[McDonnell] or the Archdeacon [Strachan] on the list of Councillors, but\r\nam, on the contrary, rather predisposed to the opinion that by resigning\r\ntheir seats they would best consult their own personal comfort and the\r\nsuccess of their designs for the spiritual good of the people. But any\r\nsuch resignation must be voluntary, since the office is held for life;\r\nand were it otherwise, no consideration could induce me to advise His\r\nMajesty to degrade the Bishop or the Archdeacon from the stations they\r\noccupy, except upon the most conclusive proof of misconduct.\" One might\r\nnot unreasonably construe these words into a pretty broad hint to Bishop\r\nMcDonnell and Dr. Strachan that they ought to resign.\r\n\r\n[167] The London _Morning Herald_ of July 11th, 1833, correctly\r\ncharacterized it as \"the oddest mixture of slander and truth, of\r\nknowledge and ignorance, of bold assertion and vacillating opinion.\"\r\n\r\n[168] \"Mr. Rolph will, we have no doubt, have the offer of the\r\nSolicitorship, but whether he will accept it is a matter more doubtful;\r\nthough we think he possibly may, provided he is to be associated in the\r\nadministration with men of a liberal policy; otherwise we are of opinion\r\nhe will decline. Such an appointment would certainly do credit to our\r\ncountry, and we hope he (Mr. Rolph) will accept the appointment if\r\noffered--that is, if he can consistently do so.\"--_Colonial Advocate_,\r\nThursday, May 2nd, 1833. See also the _Advocate_ for October 3rd, 1833.\r\n\r\n[169] See _An Account of the Dismissal of the Attorney and\r\nSolicitor-General from Office, and of the Re-appointment of Mr.\r\nHagerman_, written by Mackenzie for the General [Reform] Committee at\r\nYork, and published in the _Advocate_ for Thursday, August 29th, 1833.\r\n\r\n[170] _Ante_, p. 247.\r\n\r\n[171] As the resolution recited the facts relating to the two former\r\nexpulsions, as well as the grounds of the present one, it may not be\r\namiss to transcribe it in full. It was voted upon on Tuesday, the 17th\r\nof December (1833). Its mover was William Morris, member for Lanark. It\r\nwas in the following words: \"That this House, on the thirteenth day of\r\nDecember, 1831, in consequence of a false and scandalous libel published\r\nagainst a majority of its members by William Lyon Mackenzie, Esquire,\r\none of the members then representing the County of York, of which he\r\navowed himself the author and publisher, was induced to expel him, the\r\nsaid William Lyon Mackenzie, from this House: That notwithstanding the\r\ngross and scandalous nature of the said libel, this House, in the hope\r\nthat the said William Lyon Mackenzie would abstain from a continuance of\r\nthe offensive conduct for which he had been expelled, permitted him to\r\ntake his seat on the third day of January following, as a member for the\r\nCounty of York, after being re-elected: That in this hope, so important\r\nto the deliberate transaction of public business, so essential to the\r\nrespectability of the Legislature and peace of the country, a few days'\r\nexperience convinced this House there was so little reason to rely, that\r\non the seventh day of the same month of January, it was by a large\r\nmajority again deemed necessary to expel the said William Lyon\r\nMackenzie, for a repetition and aggravated reiteration of the aforesaid\r\nfalse and scandalous libel; and in doing so, this House, in order to\r\nsupport the dignity which ought to belong to a Legislative body,\r\nconsidered it just and proper to declare the said William Lyon Mackenzie\r\nunfit and unworthy to hold a seat in this House during the continuance\r\nof the present Parliament: That as the said William Lyon Mackenzie has\r\nnever made reparation to this House for the gross injuries which he has\r\nattempted to inflict on its character and proceedings, there is no\r\nreason to depart from the resolution of the said seventh day of January,\r\n1832.\" In amendment, Mr. MacNab, seconded by Mr. Robinson, moved that\r\nthe following words be added to the original resolution: \"And therefore\r\nhe, the said William Lyon Mackenzie, again elected and returned to\r\nrepresent the County of York in this present Parliament, is hereby\r\nexpelled.\" The amendment, as well as the original motion, was carried by\r\na vote of 22 to 18.\r\n\r\n[172] This section provides for the taking of the oath before the\r\nGovernor, Lieutenant-Governor, or person administering the Government,\r\nor \"before some person or persons authorized by the said Governor or\r\nLieutenant-Governor,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[173] The Sergeant-at-Arms was Allan MacNab, Sr., father of the junior\r\nmember for Wentworth.\r\n\r\n[174] See the _Advocate_ of Thursday, February 13th, 1834.\r\n\r\n[175] Not H. J. Boulton, who had several months before departed for\r\nNewfoundland, but George Strange Boulton, one of the members for Durham.\r\n\r\n[176] See the _Advocate_ of February 13th, 1834.\r\n\r\n[177] Mackenzie, in the _Advocate_, says \"full seven hours,\" but he did\r\nnot reach the Assembly Chamber until nearly half-past three in the\r\nafternoon, and the House adjourned at 9.30 for want of a quorum. See the\r\nsessional journal. The three removals of Mackenzie from his seat must\r\nhave occupied some minutes, and the entire debate could not possibly\r\nhave extended over quite six hours. The matter is of no particular\r\nimportance, but it shows how carefully all unsupported statements of\r\nMackenzie ought to be scrutinized before being admitted as evidence.\r\n\r\n[178] \"It is probable,\" says Mackenzie (_Colonial Advocate_, Feb. 13th),\r\n\"that the provoking language of some of the members would have ended in\r\na disturbance had I not warned the people through the press, personally\r\nat many of their dwelling houses, and in the House before I took my\r\nseat, to preserve perfect silence whatever the members said or did. They\r\nwere very orderly, and it is creditable to them that they were so. If\r\npublic opinion will not avenge our cause, violence and tumult will not\r\nhelp us.\" The irony of fate had decreed that this admirable sentiment\r\nshould not find a permanent lodgement in the writer's breast.\r\n\r\n[179] _Life and Times of Mackenzie_, vol. i., p. 311.\r\n\r\n[180] See Lord Goderich's despatch of 8th November, 1832.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nMR. HUME'S \"BANEFUL DOMINATION\" LETTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMackenzie's repeated expulsions, unjust as they were, and humiliating as\r\nwere some of the attendant circumstances, were not wholly without\r\ncompensation. For one thing they caused him to be more talked about than\r\nany other man in Upper Canada. This, of itself, would have gone far\r\ntowards reconciling him to the indignities which had been heaped upon\r\nhim, for notoriety was very dear to his heart. But a more substantial\r\nreward, and one altogether unlooked for, was in store for him.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after the scene in the Assembly described towards the\r\nclose of the last chapter, the town of York ceased to exist, having\r\nexchanged its name for the old Indian appellation which it has ever\r\nsince borne. An Act of incorporation had been obtained during the\r\nsession, whereby it was enacted that York should be constituted a body\r\ncorporate and politic by the name of the City of Toronto. The city was\r\nto be divided into wards, with two aldermen and two common councilmen\r\nfor each ward, to be elected by the inhabitants; and with a mayor, to be\r\nelected by the aldermen and councilmen from among themselves. This Act,\r\nlike the rest of the measures passed during the session, was assented to\r\non the day of adjournment--the 6th of March, 1834. On the 15th of the\r\nsame month an official proclamation appeared whereby Thursday, the 27th,\r\nwas appointed for the first election of municipal representatives. A\r\ncampaign of active canvassing was forthwith set on foot throughout the\r\ncity. As has often happened in more recent times, the contest assumed a\r\npolitical complexion. The Act of incorporation had been procured by Tory\r\ninfluences, and had been carried through the Assembly under the auspices\r\nof Sheriff Jarvis, the local member. In his speeches on the subject in\r\nthe House Mr. Jarvis had taken the reasonable and legitimate ground that\r\nthe Provincial capital had attained dimensions which rendered a separate\r\ngovernment necessary to the efficient management of its affairs. This\r\nview was participated in by Tory residents generally. The Reformers, on\r\nthe other hand, had all along been opposed to incorporation. York, they\r\nargued, was the main fortress and stronghold of the official party, who\r\nwould be almost certain to acquire a pernicious ascendency in municipal\r\naffairs, to the detriment of the rest of the community. The Province at\r\nlarge had already suffered enough from Compact domination, and it was\r\nfar from desirable to afford an opportunity for its exercise in a more\r\nrestricted field. Again, it was urged that the expense of a separate\r\nadministration for the city would more than counterbalance any\r\nadvantages to be derived therefrom. These views were put forward with\r\nmuch vehemence by reformers, both in Parliament and through the medium\r\nof the press. From all which it was evident that the impending elections\r\nwould afford a pretty accurate test of the strength of the respective\r\npolitical parties in the city.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, the Tory vote in the capital had been largely in\r\nexcess of that polled by the Reformers. That it was not so in the spring\r\nof 1834 was due in no small degree to public indignation at the unfair\r\ntreatment to which Mackenzie had been subjected. Persons who had never\r\nrecorded a Reform vote before now came forward to support candidates who\r\nwere known to be strong Reformers. It was not so much that these persons\r\nsympathized with Mackenzie, who was by many of them held in detestation\r\nand abhorrence; but they felt that gross injustice had been done,\r\nagainst which it behooved them to record their formal protest. The\r\nresult was that the sanguine calculations of the Tories were altogether\r\nfalsified, and that a majority of Reform candidates were returned to the\r\nfirst Council of the City of Toronto. Among the latter were Mackenzie\r\nhimself, who was elected as one of the aldermen for St. David's Ward,\r\nand John Rolph, who was elected for the Ward of St. Patrick.\r\n\r\nA few words of explanation are necessary in this place with regard to\r\nMr. Rolph. It will be remembered that he and the two Baldwins had\r\ndivested themselves of their gowns during the progress of the Willis\r\ndispute, and had declined to transact any further business in a court\r\nwhich they believed to be illegally constituted.[181] They did not again\r\npresent themselves before the court during Term until after the decision\r\nof the Privy Council had set their minds at rest on the subject. There\r\nwas no longer anything to prevent them from resuming their practice. The\r\nBaldwins did so, and Rolph for a time followed their example, albeit in\r\na half-hearted manner. He had long been profoundly disgusted with the\r\npartiality displayed by the judges, and by their complete subserviency\r\nto the wishes of the Executive, as expressed by their forensic\r\nmouthpiece, Attorney-General Robinson. On account, as he believed, of\r\nhis political opinions, he had been forced to contend against the\r\npersistent hostility of the judiciary. His triumphs at the bar had been\r\nwon by reason of his power over juries, and in spite of one-sided\r\ncharges from the bench. Of the understanding and judicial integrity of\r\nMr. Sherwood he had formed a very low estimate. Hagerman, who\r\ntemporarily succeeded Judge Willis, was an abler man, but his political\r\nfeelings were so strong that Rolph would not imperil the interests of\r\nhis clients by appearing before him. Upon the accession of\r\nAttorney-General Robinson to the bench the state of affairs from Rolph's\r\npoint of view was not much improved. Mr. Robinson and he had so long\r\nfought each other at the bar and on the floor of the Assembly that they\r\nhad come to regard each other as personal enemies. Rolph, rightly or\r\nwrongly, came to the conclusion that he could no longer hope to obtain\r\nany measure of justice. The necessary consequence of such a conclusion\r\nwas a resolve to abandon the practice of law, and to resume that of\r\nmedicine, which latter, indeed, he had never wholly abandoned. This\r\nresolution was not fully carried out until more than two years after it\r\nhad been formed, though he meanwhile accepted no new suits, and steadily\r\nprepared himself for the impending change. The decisive step does not\r\nappear to have been taken until 1832, when he transferred his legal\r\npractice to his brother George. Thenceforward John Rolph never again\r\nappeared in a Court of justice in the capacity of an advocate. It was a\r\nmomentous decision, for he had a fine legal practice, and enjoyed the\r\nreputation of being the most eloquent man at the Upper Canadian bar. He\r\nhad outlived the exuberance of youth, and was at this time nearly forty\r\nyears old--an age at which few men would have had the courage to abandon\r\na pursuit which had been followed with signal success for many years. He\r\nresumed the practice of medicine and surgery, and was thenceforward\r\nknown as \"Doctor\" Rolph. For some years before this time he had resided\r\nat Dundas. He now removed to the capital, where he was well known, and\r\nwhere he continued to reside until the breaking out of the Rebellion\r\ntowards the close of 1837. He soon won a distinguished place in the\r\nranks of his new calling, and reached a preeminence therein as great as\r\nhe had ever attained at the bar. There was no regularly-organized\r\nmedical college in Upper Canada, and the facilities for acquiring a\r\ncompetent medical training were few. In response to urgent requests from\r\na number of influential persons in Toronto he established a private\r\nmedical class, and gave instruction to a limited number of students. His\r\nteaching was eminently successful, and he made himself greatly beloved\r\nby his students. He seemed to have the whole round of medical literature\r\nat his fingers' ends, and his marvellous knowledge and graphic power of\r\nexpression kindled in the breasts of the young men a love of knowledge\r\nfor its own sake.[182] By no one were his attainments held in higher\r\nrespect than by the Lieutenant-Governor. Sir John urged him to found a\r\npermanent medical college, and promised that Government aid for such an\r\nenterprise should not be wanting. But Dr. Rolph had other views. He had\r\nfor several years been out of public life, but with no idea of so\r\nremaining. He was resolved to re-enter Parliament at the first suitable\r\nopportunity, and did not allow his professional pursuits to absorb all\r\nhis attention. Unlike Robert Baldwin, who to a great extent held himself\r\naloof from politics at this time, Rolph took a leading part at Reform\r\nmeetings and caucuses, and did his utmost to give practical shape to the\r\nReform policy. Baldwin, notwithstanding his undoubted zeal for Liberal\r\nprinciples, was imbued with somewhat exclusive social ideas, and was\r\nnot in active sympathy with the Reformers at this period. He regarded\r\nMackenzie as very much of a demagogue, and as a person with whom he\r\ncould not hold any very intimate relations. The sentiments entertained\r\nby Baldwin for Mackenzie seem to have been closely akin to those\r\nentertained by Sir John Falstaff for the troops with whom he declared\r\nthat he would not march through Coventry. Mackenzie's noisy verbosity\r\nand self-assertion offended the patrician instincts of Mr. Baldwin, to\r\nwhom, indeed, the little proletarian was altogether distasteful and\r\nrepulsive. This feeling, however, seems to have been due to the\r\nantipathetic natures of the two men, rather than to any mere feeling of\r\nexclusiveness on the part of Mr. Baldwin. They had as little in common\r\nas two persons very well could have. Without entering any further into\r\nthe question, it will be sufficient to say that the one had a judgment\r\nunder strict discipline, while the judgment of the other was always\r\nsubordinate to the circumstances or prejudices of the moment--a fatal\r\ndefect in one who aspires to be a leader of men. Mr. Baldwin made no\r\nsecret of his conviction that no substantial progress could be made by\r\nthe Reform party so long as one like Mackenzie was permitted to have any\r\ncommanding voice in its counsels, or at any rate to have any hand in the\r\nshaping or directing of its policy. Rolph took a broader view, and while\r\nhe admitted the notoriously weak points in Mackenzie's character, did\r\nnot feel disposed either to throw him overboard altogether or to deprive\r\nhim of a share in the direction of party affairs. He naturally felt and\r\nspoke strongly on the subject of the expulsions. For Mackenzie\r\npersonally he had never felt much liking, but he hated injustice, and\r\ndid not hesitate to give the expelled member all the support, moral and\r\notherwise, which he could command. He was wont to say that Mackenzie\r\nmight yet do much good work for Reform, if he could only be kept in his\r\nproper place. Mackenzie, on his side, never wearied of sounding Rolph's\r\npraises, and he sometimes did so in extravagant terms. Wherever he went\r\nhe proclaimed the Doctor as the one man in Upper Canada capable of\r\nleading the Reform party to triumph and permanent power. Bidwell and\r\nPerry were well enough in their way, but to neither of them would he pin\r\nhis faith if Rolph questioned the wisdom of their counsels.\r\n\r\nSuch was the state of affairs at the time of the election of the first\r\nCouncil of the City of Toronto. In that Council, as already mentioned,\r\nthere was a preponderance of Reform members. According to the provisions\r\nof the Act of incorporation the aldermen and councilmen were to hold\r\ntheir first meeting on Thursday, the 3rd of April, when they were to\r\nproceed to the election of a mayor. As the Reform members were able to\r\ncommand the situation, they held a caucus on the evening of Monday, the\r\n31st of March, to concert a scheme of action, and to take steps to turn\r\ntheir numerical superiority in the Council to the best account. An\r\nunderstanding had already been arrived at as to the mayoralty. Dr. Rolph\r\nhad been pitched upon by common consent to fill the chair of the chief\r\nmagistrate. He was upon the whole better fitted to grace the position\r\nthan any other man in the city, and the Reform members contemplated\r\ntheir candidate with pride. But at the caucus held on the evening of the\r\n31st matters took an altogether unexpected turn. Dr. Rolph did not\r\nattend, being kept away by professional duties. It was suggested by\r\nJames Lesslie, one of the aldermen from St. David's Ward, that the\r\nDoctor was indifferent as to the mayoralty, and that he would be quite\r\nwilling to waive any claims to the position which he might be supposed\r\nto have. It was further suggested that the interests of the Reformers\r\nwould be best promoted by the elevation of the editor of the _Advocate_\r\nto the chief magistracy. Mackenzie, it was urged, had been treated with\r\nshameful indignity by the Assembly, and had been held up to contempt by\r\nthe official party generally. He had been maligned at the Home Office as\r\na personage whom the Secretary could not admit to his presence\r\nconsistently with due respect to himself and his office. He had been\r\nrepresented as a snarling little upstart who, by the votes of the lowest\r\nand most rascally section of the Radicals, had been placed in a position\r\nunsuited to his character and belongings. It had been especially urged\r\nagainst him in England that the better class of Reformers held aloof\r\nfrom and thoroughly despised him. There could be no doubt that by such\r\nrepresentations as these Mackenzie had been subjected to much unmerited\r\nobloquy and annoyance during his sojourn in the old country. The present\r\nconjuncture of affairs, it was said, afforded an excellent opportunity\r\nfor atoning to him for what he had endured, and at the same time for\r\nscoring a double victory for Reform principles. His elevation to the\r\nchief magistracy of the capital city of Upper Canada would furnish the\r\nmost conclusive answer that could possibly be made to the abuse and\r\nslander wherewith he had been assailed. The position was one of high\r\nhonour and dignity. It would be impossible to represent the occupant of\r\nthat position as the mere tool and mouthpiece of a low Radical clique,\r\nor as a person whom no gentleman could admit to a conference. There was\r\nmuch plausibility about these arguments, and they had the more weight\r\ninasmuch as Dr. Rolph was said to be personally indifferent about the\r\nmatter. Dr. Rolph, moreover, needed no accession of dignity. He could\r\ncertainly derive none from being elected to the mayoralty, and could\r\nvery well afford to waive his claims. This view of the matter finally\r\nprevailed, and it was agreed, before the adjournment of the caucus,\r\nthat, provided Dr. Rolph were a consenting party, Mackenzie should be\r\nthe first mayor of Toronto.\r\n\r\nWhen the matter was submitted to Dr. Rolph he expressed some surprise at\r\nthe action of the caucus. He appears to have felt convinced that no\r\ncredit to the Reform cause was to be won by placing Mackenzie in a\r\nprominent position. He knew Mackenzie to be a man who could not stand\r\nprosperity, and whose want of mental ballast was such that he was not\r\nfit to be trusted with power. He was moreover very much disposed to\r\nsuspect that the little man himself was at the bottom of the movement in\r\nhis favour, which was probably the fact. Still, the Doctor was compelled\r\nto admit that there was much force in the arguments put forward, and he\r\nwas by no means disposed to press his own claims. He therefore gave his\r\nassent; and from that moment the question was to be regarded as\r\npractically settled, although the matter was kept a profound secret\r\namong the persons most immediately concerned.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative members of the Council also held a caucus before the\r\nday appointed for the election of a mayor. Their purpose was to organize\r\ntheir forces, and to present the best front which their numerical\r\ninferiority would admit of. They had assumed that Dr. Rolph would as a\r\nmatter of course be the choice of the Reform members for the chief\r\nmagistracy, and this assumption had been confirmed by common rumour, so\r\nthat they entertained no doubt on the subject. The selection met with\r\ntheir full approval. In fact, unless a mayor was to be chosen from their\r\nown number--a thing out of the question with such a preponderance of\r\nReform members--no man would have been so acceptable to them as Dr.\r\nRolph. He was known to and respected by them all, and it was felt that\r\nhe would fill the chair with credit to the city. They accordingly\r\nresolved to give him their support, and one of their number, Mr. Thomas\r\nCarfrae, Jr., wrote to him on the subject. But, Dr. Rolph had meanwhile\r\ngiven his assent to the project of Mackenzie's election, and was not in\r\na position to accept support from any quarter. After careful\r\nconsideration he had determined to resign his seat in the Council. He\r\nforesaw that Mackenzie would render himself unpopular, and deemed it\r\nprobable that he would be guilty of indiscretions which no public\r\nrepresentative of a political party could properly defend. The course of\r\nsubsequent events was such as to fully justify this forecast. Dr. Rolph\r\nreplied to Mr. Carfrae, thanking him for his offer of support, but\r\nannouncing that he was about to resign his seat. He also wrote to his\r\nfriend Dr. Morrison, one of the representatives of St. Andrew's Ward, to\r\nthe same effect. The contents of these two letters did not become known\r\nuntil the meeting of the Council on the 3rd of April, otherwise steps\r\nwould unquestionably have been taken to prevent Mackenzie's election;\r\nfor the Reformers, with two or three exceptions, were not sufficiently\r\nanxious to elect him to oust Dr. Rolph for his sake; and as for the\r\nConservatives, the idea of Mackenzie's elevation to the highest seat in\r\nthe Council would at all times have been simply intolerable to them. At\r\nthe appointed time all the aldermen and councilmen were in their places\r\nexcept Dr. Rolph. The chair was temporarily taken by John Doel, one of\r\nthe representatives from St. Andrew's Ward. It was moved by Franklin\r\nJackes, councilman from St. David's Ward, and seconded by James Lesslie,\r\nMackenzie's colleague as aldermanic representative from the same ward,\r\n\"that William Lyon Mackenzie, Esquire, be the mayor of this city.\" The\r\nmotion took the Conservative members completely by surprise, and they\r\ndid not attempt to conceal their dissatisfaction, and even disgust.\r\nSeveral of them arose in succession, and spoke in favour of Dr. Rolph.\r\nDr. Morrison then announced Dr. Rolph's decision, and read his letter by\r\nway of confirmation. Mr. Carfrae intimated that he had received from\r\nthe Doctor a letter to the same purport. There was thus no room for\r\nfurther discussion. The pre-concerted programme was carried out.\r\nMackenzie received ten votes in support of his candidature, which\r\nconstituted a majority. He was declared duly elected, and took the chair\r\nof honour. During the afternoon of the same day he took the prescribed\r\noath, and his authority was complete. He could boast that he was the\r\nfirst mayor of Toronto, and also the first mayor ever elected in Upper\r\nCanada.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he been installed in office ere he began to furnish\r\nexamples of that perverse and almost inconceivable want of judgment\r\nwhich attended upon him from the beginning of his life to its end.\r\nKnowing the light in which he was regarded by the Conservative members\r\nof the Council, it might have been supposed that he would be specially\r\ncircumspect in his demeanour towards them, and careful not to give\r\ngratuitous offence. On the contrary, he conducted himself like a\r\nveritable Jack-in-Office, and disgusted not only the Conservatives but\r\nsome of his own friends. He was constantly intruding his personal\r\nantagonisms upon the Council, and trying to induce the members to take\r\nsides. His indiscretion in the matter of the famous \"baneful domination\"\r\nletter is absolutely incomprehensible. The particulars can only be given\r\nvery briefly in these pages.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May, Mr. Mackenzie received from Joseph Hume, the\r\nRadical member for Middlesex in the British House of Commons, an\r\nextraordinary letter--a letter which, for violence of tone and\r\nintemperance of language, might almost have been written by the editor\r\nof the _Advocate_ himself. It referred to the Reverend Egerton Ryerson,\r\na leading minister of the Methodist Church and editor of _The Christian\r\nGuardian_, in terms which it is astonishing to think that a gentleman in\r\nMr. Hume's position should have permitted himself to employ. Now,\r\nMackenzie had quarrelled with Mr. Ryerson not long before, and had\r\ndevoted much space in the _Advocate_ to maligning him. He saw here an\r\nopportunity for a further attack, with which view he deliberately\r\npublished \"copious extracts\"[183] from the letter in the issue of his\r\npaper dated the 22nd of May. The effect was electrical, for the\r\nreferences to Mr. Ryerson, bad as they were, were not the portions of\r\nthe letter most calculated to excite astonishment in the public mind.\r\nThe phrase which called forth prompt execration from all classes of the\r\ncommunity was one in which the writer, referring to Mackenzie's last\r\nelection to the Assembly and his expulsion therefrom, characterized\r\nthose proceedings as events which must hasten the crisis that was fast\r\napproaching in the affairs of the Canadas, and which would \"terminate in\r\nindependence and freedom from the baneful domination of the mother\r\ncountry.\" These extraordinary words--extraordinary as proceeding from a\r\nBritish statesman to a colonist who was likewise a public\r\ncharacter--were printed in the _Advocate_, like the rest of the letter,\r\nin large type. It was subsequently urged[184] on Mr. Hume's behalf that\r\nhe had not meant to imply _separation_ from the mother country, but only\r\nan end to the false and pernicious system of governing the colony; and\r\nthis explanation was admitted by him[185] to express what he had\r\nintended to signify. But if Mr. Hume could write so indiscreetly on such\r\na subject, what is to be thought of the newspaper editor and the\r\npolitician who had no better sense than to give such a production to the\r\nworld of Upper Canada, more especially while he himself occupied the\r\nposition of mayor of its most important city?\r\n\r\nNo sooner was the number of the _Advocate_ containing this letter in the\r\nhands of the public than an outcry arose on every hand. The Tories saw\r\ntheir advantage, and made the most of it. Now, it was said, the real\r\ndesigns of Mackenzie and those who acted with him were no longer masked.\r\nWhat they wanted was not constitutional Reform, but separation from the\r\nEmpire, and the establishment of a republic. And it was not only Tories\r\nwho spoke and felt thus. Persons who cordially hated the domination of\r\nthe Compact, and who had condemned the treatment of Mackenzie as\r\nunconstitutional, tyrannical and unjust, now felt that such a man\r\ndeserved no sympathy. He was evidently a rebel at heart.[186] He had\r\nbrought reproach not only on himself, but upon the party to which he\r\nbelonged. Reform journals hastened to signify their repudiation of the\r\nsentiments of the objectionable letter. \"We profess ourselves Radical\r\nReformers,\" said the _Freeman_, \"and willing to go any reasonable length\r\nin correcting abuses, because we know extensive grievances have existed\r\nboth in the mother country and in these colonies.... but we cannot bring\r\nourselves to support violent and unprincipled factions.\" \"It has often\r\nbeen the misfortune,\" said _The British Whig_, of Kingston, \"for those\r\nwho have laboured to emancipate the people of this colony from Tory\r\nmisrule to be accused of disaffection to the mother country, and of a\r\ndesign to effect the substitution of a republican mode of Government for\r\ntheir present monarchical form. That no accusation is more generally\r\nfalse we are thoroughly satisfied; and yet, owing to the indiscreetness\r\nof certain writers, the enemies of political change have had too many\r\nopportunities afforded them to ground their assertions on something like\r\nproof. Here is a letter published by a leading Reformer, without one\r\nsingle remark in detestation of the doctrine it promulgates.... Does Mr.\r\nMackenzie sincerely believe that the independence of this Province\r\nwould be beneficial to its inhabitants; or is he of opinion that the\r\ndomination of the mother country is baneful? If he answer in the\r\nnegative, as we think he will, why in the name of common sense did he\r\nafford his enemies so much occasion to brand him with disloyalty?\" Said\r\n_The Free Press_, of Hamilton, \"It is not the domination of the mother\r\ncountry that Reformers complain of; it is only the tyrannical conduct of\r\na small and despicable faction in the colony. The domination of the\r\nmother country is as necessary to our present happiness and future\r\ngreatness as the mother's breast is to the infant.\" \"There can be but\r\none opinion,\" said _The British American Journal_, of St. Catharines,\r\n\"in the minds of honest men, relative to the sentiments contained in\r\nthis letter. That they are seditious and revolutionary is painfully\r\nevident; besides the language in which it is couched, the brief\r\nreference to the important subjects treated of, and the peculiar manner\r\nof its appearance before the Canadian public, irresistibly force the\r\nconclusion upon our mind that it is the premature disclosure of a plan\r\nlong premeditated to separate the Canadas from the empire of Great\r\nBritain, and either annex them to the confederated union of the States,\r\nor establish separate independent republic Governments; as far as the\r\nauthor or publisher of the letter is concerned, it is immaterial which.\"\r\nMackenzie himself was characterized as a man who was doing his best to\r\ndrive the people headlong and blindfold into rebellion. Such being the\r\ntone of the Liberal press, that of the Tory journals may readily be\r\nconceived. Some of them demanded that the Government should institute an\r\nimmediate prosecution of Mackenzie. Indignation meetings were held all\r\nover the Province, at which loyal addresses to His Majesty were passed.\r\nThe Methodist Conference and other bodies, secular as well as religious,\r\nhastened to pass resolutions condemnatory of Mr. Hume's sentiments, and\r\nto forward the same to the Lieutenant-Governor. The excitement in\r\nToronto was tremendous. Before noon of the day on which the offensive\r\nletter appeared in print a public meeting had been called to protest\r\nagainst the disloyal sentiments embodied in it. It was numerously\r\nattended, and, though a good many Reformers were present, a vote of\r\ncensure on Mackenzie was passed without a dissentient voice. The matter\r\nwas brought up in the City Council, and, though the support of the\r\nReform members enabled him to escape the official censure of that body,\r\nhe was compelled to submit to a series of criticisms which must have\r\nbeen exceedingly galling to his feelings. By this one misguided act he\r\nhad contrived to do enough harm to far more than counterbalance any good\r\nwhich had been effected through his mission to England; and there were\r\nmany Reformers who, in spite of all his protestations, never again felt\r\nany confidence in him, politically or otherwise.\r\n\r\nIn his capacity of mayor he was fairly assiduous in his attention to\r\nhis duties. The city was subjected to a visitation of Asiatic cholera\r\nduring the year, and he appears to have done his utmost to stay the\r\nprogress of the pestilence, as well as to provide for the treatment of\r\nthe stricken patients. He was nevertheless guilty of a number of\r\nindiscretions which rendered him odious to a large proportion of the\r\npopulation. His pettiness of spirit was incessantly asserting itself. No\r\nperson in the community, however insignificant, was beneath his wrath\r\nwhen his sense of personal dignity was wounded. On one occasion a\r\nwretched woman of intemperate habits and loose character was brought\r\nbefore him in the Mayor's Court. She was loquacious and abusive, and\r\nMackenzie, in a rage, ordered her to be placed in the public stocks.\r\nThere were still a public pillory and stocks within the city, but, like\r\nthose in Squire Hazeldean's parish, they had long been disused.\r\nMackenzie had probably never heard of the maxim _Quieta non movere_. At\r\nany rate, the greater part of his life was spent in efforts in an\r\nopposite direction. His sentence was carried out, and the culprit was\r\nplaced in the stocks. Had this been the act of a fossilized member of\r\nthe Compact it would not have appeared very incongruous, but in\r\nMackenzie it seemed ludicrously out of keeping with his professions. It\r\naroused the popular indignation against him to a higher pitch than ever;\r\nbut it had one good effect: it led to the removal and destruction of the\r\nbarbarous relics of mediaevalism. To Mackenzie belongs the questionable\r\ncredit of reviving their use when Tory magistrates had become ashamed to\r\nemploy them any longer. He is entitled to the further distinction of\r\nbeing the last magistrate in Upper Canada to sanction their use; and\r\nthat, too, in the case of a poor and defenceless woman, whose\r\nwretchedness ought to have removed her far from the possibility of his\r\nvengeance.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the summer was spent by both the political\r\nparties in the Province in preparing for the general election contest\r\nwhich was to take place before the close of the year. It was held in\r\nOctober. Had it been held some months earlier, while the public sympathy\r\nwith Mackenzie in consequence of his repeated expulsions was at its\r\nheight, an overwhelming preponderance of Reform members would have been\r\nreturned. The publication of Mr. Hume's letter in the interval had\r\nalienated many sympathies and lost many votes to the Reform cause.\r\nStill, there was a strong tendency throughout the greater part of the\r\nProvince in the direction of Reform, and the Reformers made\r\nunprecedented exertions. They succeeded in winning to their side a large\r\nnumber of the Roman Catholic electorate, and they absorbed most of the\r\nrecent arrivals from beyond sea. Bidwell and Perry were re-elected for\r\nLennox and Addington. William Benjamin Wells, a young lawyer of\r\ntwenty-five, who afterwards made some mark as a newspaper writer on the\r\nReform side, and from whose \"Canadiana\" several extracts have already\r\nbeen made in these pages, was returned for the County of Grenville. He\r\nwas an Upper Canadian by birth, of U. E. Loyalist stock, and the\r\ngrandson of a volunteer who fought at the siege of Louisbourg. Oxford\r\nreturned for one of its members Dr. Charles Duncombe, who was destined\r\nto take a conspicuous part in the insurrectionary events of two years\r\nlater. He was a medical practitioner of great intelligence and wide\r\ninfluence, an eloquent and forcible speaker, and an ardent Reformer. He\r\nresided on the Burford Plains, near the present village of Bishopsgate,\r\na few miles west of Brantford. The two members returned for the County\r\nof Simcoe represented very nearly the two extremes of political opinion.\r\nWilliam Benjamin Robinson, a brother of the Chief Justice, was, as\r\nbecame one of his race, the incarnation of Family Compact Toryism. His\r\ncolleague was Samuel Lount, whose name, owing to his untimely fate and\r\nthe melancholy circumstances attending it, arouses a host of sad\r\nmemories. It may safely be said that of all the victims of the rising of\r\n1837 none has been so sincerely and generally mourned. His execution is\r\njustly regarded in the light of a judicial murder and a stain upon our\r\ncountry's annals. As a peculiar interest has ever since attached to his\r\nname, and as but little is generally known with respect to him, it may\r\nbe proper to record a few particulars. He was born on the banks of the\r\nSusquehanna River, in the State of Pennsylvania, on the 24th of\r\nSeptember, 1791. His father, Gabriel Lount, was an Englishman, and a\r\nnative of Bristol, who settled in the United States after the close of\r\nthe Revolutionary War, and married an American lady of English descent.\r\nGabriel Lount never lost his British proclivities during his residence\r\nin the republic, and in the spring of the year 1811, accompanied by his\r\nson and the rest of his family, he removed to Upper Canada. He settled\r\nin the township of Whitchurch, where he practised as a surveyor, and in\r\nthe course of the nest few years laid out many official surveys for the\r\nProvincial Government. Samuel, prior to his removal to Canada, had\r\nlearned the trade of a blacksmith, which he carried on for some years at\r\nHolland Landing. He had a farm in the same neighbourhood which he\r\ncultivated with much pecuniary success. Being a man of great industry\r\nand intelligence, he gradually amassed considerable property, and became\r\nwhat for those days might be regarded as wealthy. Better still, he\r\nacquired the respect and confidence of the people around him, for he was\r\nkind-hearted and generous, and spent much of his time in ministering to\r\nthe necessities of those incoming settlers who were less advantageously\r\nsituated than himself. To this day the neighbourhood abounds with\r\ntraditions of his noble unselfishness, and there are old men and women\r\nwho, after the lapse of half a century, cannot speak of Samuel Lount\r\nwithout a dimness of vision and a huskiness of the voice.[187] Though a\r\nzealous loyalist, he was an enthusiastic Reformer, and vehemently\r\nopposed to the domination of the faction whose selfishness went far to\r\nparalyze the life of the Province. He was an excellent speaker, and\r\nduring election contests did much to awaken public opinion on the\r\nfruitful subject of Executive abuses. He now, in response to pressing\r\nsolicitations, allowed himself to be nominated as a candidate for the\r\nrepresentation of Simcoe in the Assembly, and, as has been seen, was\r\nreturned for that constituency along with an ultra-Tory. In personal\r\nappearance he was considerably above the medium height, and of robust\r\nfigure; of dark complexion, and with a pleasant, intelligent expression\r\nof countenance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: I am your obt Servant\r\nDavid Gibson][TR: Handwritten.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe County of York, smarting under a sense of indignity and partial\r\ndisfranchisement, rendered itself specially conspicuous in the contest.\r\nDuring the preceding year an Act[188] had been passed extending and\r\nreadjusting the representation of the County, and dividing it for\r\nelectoral purposes into four Ridings, designated respectively the First,\r\nSecond, Third and Fourth. Each of these now returned a Radical Reformer.\r\nThe First Riding returned David Gibson, a land surveyor who resided on\r\nYonge Street, about eight miles north of the city, near the present\r\nvillage of Willowdale. He was of Scottish nationality, having been born\r\nin the parish of Glammis, Forfarshire, on the 9th of March, 1804. Within\r\nlegitimate bounds there was no more pronounced Reformer in the Province\r\nthan Mr. Gibson, whose house was a sort of rendezvous or place of\r\nmeeting for party caucuses. He was an honourable and high-minded man,\r\nmuch esteemed by his neighbours, and in high favour with his party. The\r\nSecond Riding chose Mackenzie. Many of the voters disapproved of some of\r\nhis acts, but his paper was largely read among them, and it was felt\r\nthat some recompense was due to him for the indignities which he had\r\nsuffered. The Third Riding returned Dr. Thomas David Morrison, of\r\nToronto, who has already been referred to in connection with the\r\nmunicipal affairs of the city. He was a physician enjoying a good\r\npractice; a man of good sense and wise counsels, and a prominent\r\npersonage in the ranks of Reform. For the Fourth Riding was returned\r\nJohn Mackintosh, a resident of Toronto, and a connexion, by marriage, of\r\nMackenzie. He was a steady Reformer, of no remarkable abilities, who a\r\nfew months previously had been elected President of the Metropolitan\r\nDistrict Reform Convention, and was known to be to a large extent under\r\nMackenzie's control. Such were the four York representatives.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the contest the Reformers of the Province had secured a\r\ncertain majority, which led them to look eagerly forward to the meeting\r\nof Parliament, although, with the exception of Bidwell and Perry, their\r\nbest and most trusted chiefs had no seats therein. Rolph and the\r\nBaldwins had positively refused to stand for any of the constituencies,\r\nalthough strongly urged to do so. They seem to have felt that the\r\npolitical pulse was not healthy, and that no credit was to be won,\r\neither for themselves or for the Reform cause, while the morbid symptoms\r\ncontinued. The worst symptom of all in their eyes was the ascendency of\r\nMackenzie and his satellites among the rural and uneducated part of the\r\ncommunity.[189] With this ascendency they were wholly out of accord, and\r\nthey awaited the time when he should find his proper level in public\r\nopinion. Dr. Rolph had brought himself to acquiesce in this estimate of\r\nMackenzie with great reluctance; and it is probable that his strong\r\nsuspicions of double-dealing in the matter of the mayoralty election had\r\nsomething to do with his change of views.\r\n\r\nBy this time Mackenzie had become tired of publishing the _Advocate_,\r\nwhich was not a commercial success. Early in November the last number\r\npublished under his auspices made its appearance, and the editor was at\r\nliberty to devote his chief energies to his legislative duties.[190]\r\nDuring the second week in December he and a number of his political\r\nfriends formed what they called the Canadian Alliance Society, for the\r\npromotion of Responsible Government, the abolition of the law of\r\nPrimogeniture, the secularization of the Clergy Reserves, and other\r\nneedful reforms, most of which have since been conceded. At the\r\nbeginning of the new year (1835) Mackenzie again offered himself as a\r\ncandidate for the representation of St. David's Ward in the City Council\r\nof Toronto, but he was defeated by Robert Baldwin Sullivan, a brilliant\r\nToronto lawyer, and a kinsman of Robert Baldwin. The Council elected the\r\nsuccessful candidate as mayor for the ensuing year.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[181] _Ante_, p. 187.\r\n\r\n[182] \"To his instruction, and the love of knowledge which he never\r\nfailed to inspire in those who came within the magic of his eloquence,\r\nmany men who have since made their mark on the history of Canada owe\r\ntheir first start in intellectual progress. Notable among these is the\r\npresent Chief Superintendent of Education, who has acknowledged that if\r\nhe has achieved any distinction, it is mainly due to the love of\r\nknowledge with which he was inspired by the eloquence and example of Dr.\r\nRolph.\" Such was the late Dr. Ryerson's own testimony, as published in\r\nthe _Journal of Education_, upon Dr. Rolph's death in 1870.\r\n\r\n[183] The phrase is Mackenzie's own. See his remarks preceding the\r\nextracts in the _Advocate_ of May 22nd.\r\n\r\n[184] By Dr. Morrison in the Toronto City Council. See the report of the\r\nproceedings of that body at the meeting held on Monday, June 9th, 1834.\r\nOn the subject generally, see the pamphlet published in Toronto in 1834\r\nentitled _The Celebrated Letter of Joseph Hume_, etc.\r\n\r\n[185] In a letter dated 14th July, 1834, and published in the _Advocate_\r\nof September 25th. Mr. Hume there states his meaning to have been \"that\r\nthe misrule of the Government in Canada, and the monopolizing selfish\r\ndomination of such men as had lately (though but a small faction of the\r\npeople) resisted all improvement and reform, would lose the countenance\r\nof the authorities in Downing Street, and leave the people in freedom to\r\nmanage their own affairs.\"\r\n\r\n[186] The following extract is from a cleverly-written letter signed \"O.\r\nP. Q.,\" which appeared in the _Courier_ of June 5th, 1834. It spoke the\r\nsentiments of nearly all the newspapers in the country, of whatsoever\r\nshade of politics: \"But for that letter the people of this Province\r\nmight long remain in ignorance of the real motives by which your conduct\r\nhas been actuated. They might long regard you as a persecuted\r\npatriot.... But your imprudence or your vanity has been the means of\r\ncompletely unmasking and placing you before the people of this country\r\nin all the naked deformity of an acknowledged traitor. Henceforth you\r\nmust be content to be regarded as the secret abettor of a heartless\r\nconspiracy.... Do not think, Sir, that these are the sentiments of a\r\nviolent political opponent who approves of the measures adopted towards\r\nyou by the House of Assembly.... These views, Sir, are the views of a\r\nman who has ever denounced the course your adversaries have pursued\r\ntowards you as unwise, unjust and unconstitutional. They are the\r\nsentiments of a man who, if he had the power to punish the persons who\r\nfirst rose you from poverty, ignominy and ruin, to comparative affluence\r\nand popular notoriety, would have sent the destroyers of your press to\r\nless favoured regions. They are the sentiments of one who had up to the\r\npublication of the letter ... regarded you as a man attached to the\r\ninstitutions of your country.... It is an old adage, 'Give him rope\r\nenough,' etc. You have a moderate quantity, and if the avowal of such\r\nsentiments as you have lately promulgated do not afford you a few yards\r\nmore, you may regard yourself as infinitely more fortunate than many\r\nbetter and bolder men.\"\r\n\r\n[187] \"To the many poor settlers who came from Europe, and obtained\r\ngrants of lands from the government, he was a friend and adviser, and in\r\ncases of necessity their wants were supplied from his purse or his\r\ngranaries. Many is the time, said some of our fellow-prisoners, that we\r\nhave seen him, after the toils of the day were over, leave his home to\r\ncarry provisions for miles through the pathless forest, to the shanty of\r\nsome poor and destitute settler, who with wife and family were rendered\r\nby want and sickness utterly destitute. Those acquainted with the\r\nhistory of new settlements need not be told how often those who have\r\nbeen accustomed to better days are obliged to embark in a new career of\r\nlife, the duties of which they are totally ignorant and wholly unfitted\r\nfor, nor how often sickness is engendered by their great bodily\r\nexertions, by neglect and deprivation. In a country like that in which\r\nMr. Lount was settled, the inhabitants resided far apart, and consisted\r\ngenerally of old, worn, and superannuated British officers, who, at the\r\nclose of the war, pitched their tents, for the last time, in the\r\nwilderness. The sums which they obtained from the sale of their\r\nhalf-pay, almost expended in the transportation of their little\r\nfamilies, before arriving on the lands assigned them by\r\ngovernment--unfitted, from their former pursuits, to bear the drudgery\r\ntheir new course of life required, it was frequently the case, that\r\nbefore they could raise anything from their lands, they became perfectly\r\ndestitute of the necessaries of subsistence. Too proud to seek\r\nassistance, they would starve rather than communicate their situation;\r\nbut in Lount, their generous neighbour, they found one quick to discover\r\nand prompt in affording relief, and he would minister to their wants\r\nwith such delicacy that the most sensitive would experience a pleasure\r\nrather than the pang of wounded pride.\"--Theller's _Canada in 1837-38_,\r\nvol. i., pp. 233, 234. I transfer these remarks, not because I have any\r\nrespect for Theller's personal testimony on any subject, but because in\r\nthe present instance his language clearly expresses the general\r\nsentiment of the period with regard to Samuel Lount, and is confirmed by\r\nthe remembrance of many persons still living in and near Holland\r\nLanding.\r\n\r\n[188] 3 Wm. IV., c. 15, passed 13th February, 1833.\r\n\r\n[189] In the preceding February Dr. Baldwin had thus written in reply to\r\na notification to attend as a delegate at the District Convention: \"This\r\nhonour I beg leave to decline, and for this reason: that having\r\nheretofore served the country to the utmost of my humble abilities as\r\ntheir representative in Parliament, with the sincerest integrity of\r\npurpose in maintenance of popular rights, unspotted, I trust, by one\r\nsingle vote of a contrary tendency, I, together with many others of the\r\nstaunchest friends of those rights, experienced such extreme fickleness\r\nof popular opinion that this conclusion has long been formed in my mind:\r\nthat the great body of the people of this Province (without doubt there\r\nare many honourable exceptions), in no wise ignorant of their rights or\r\nthe great value of them, are nevertheless shamefully indifferent into\r\nwhose hands they commit their preservation and due exercise. Experience\r\nalone must teach the people. This experience is coming to them by\r\npainful lessons.... Under these circumstances I beg you will make my\r\napology,\" etc. The letter appears in the _Advocate_ of March 13th, 1834,\r\nfollowing one to a similar purport from Dr. Rolph.\r\n\r\n[190] It was continued for some time after by another hand, under the\r\nname of _The Correspondent and Advocate_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSEE, THE CONQUERING HERO COMES!\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1835.]\r\n\r\nParliament met on the 15th of January, 1835, when the Reform majority in\r\nthe Assembly were able to once more elect Mr. Bidwell to the\r\nSpeakership. The vote stood thirty-one to twenty-seven. Among the\r\nminority were five or six Conservative members who repudiated the name\r\nof Tory, and were opposed to the policy of the official party, to whom,\r\nas has been seen,[191] they merely yielded a qualified support as the\r\nless of two evils. Such being the state of affairs in the Assembly, the\r\nCompact party were of course precluded from making any further serious\r\nattempts to keep Mackenzie out of the House. The proceedings of previous\r\nsessions relative to the several expulsions were upon motion of\r\nMackenzie himself expunged from the journals of the House. The baneful\r\ndomination letter was made the subject of a long discussion, in the\r\ncourse of which Mackenzie received some exceedingly hard hits from\r\nSolicitor-General Hagerman; but as he had been manifestly in the wrong\r\nin giving publicity to that letter, and as he had been disciplined by\r\nmembers of his party to keep silence in the event of an attack on that\r\nscore, he sat quietly through the Solicitor-General's onslaught.\r\n\r\nThe most important proceedings of the session, and the only ones of\r\nwhich it is necessary to take cognizance in these pages, were those\r\nrelating to the Seventh Report of the Grievance Committee, to which\r\nfrequent reference has already been made. On Friday, the 23rd of\r\nJanuary, Mackenzie moved for and obtained the appointment of a Special\r\nCommittee on Grievances, with power to send for persons, papers and\r\nrecords, and with authority to report to the House from time to time by\r\nbill, address or otherwise. Mackenzie himself acted as Chairman of the\r\nCommittee, the other members of which, as finally struck, were Dr.\r\nMorrison, David Gibson and Charles Waters, one of the members for\r\nPrescott. The famous Seventh Report, which did more to arouse the Home\r\nGovernment on the subject of Upper Canadian affairs than all previous\r\nefforts in that direction, was completed and presented to the Assembly\r\non Friday, the 10th of April. It was a truly formidable indictment. It\r\nrecapitulated the various grievances under which the Province laboured,\r\nand which called loudly for remedy. These have been already set forth in\r\nformer chapters of the present work, and need not here be enlarged upon.\r\nThe prevailing tone of the Report was temperate and calm, and there is\r\nlittle or nothing in it to which serious exception can be taken,\r\nalthough, as may easily be discerned from internal evidence, the\r\ncompilers felt strongly the importance of a vivid presentation of their\r\ncase. The Report proper occupies only fifteen folio pages of the\r\nappendix to the official journals of the session; but the evidence taken\r\nby the Committee, and the various letters, papers and documents which go\r\nto make up the mass of valuable information submitted to the Assembly,\r\nextend to voluminous dimensions. In addition to the copies printed for\r\ninsertion in the appendix to the journal, two thousand copies of the\r\ncomplete work were issued separately in octavo form for distribution. It\r\nthus obtained a considerable circulation throughout the Province; and a\r\ncopy was also sent to each member of the British House of Commons. The\r\nfirst copy that left the binder's hands was forwarded to the Colonial\r\nSecretary. All the most pressing grievances were dealt with in greater\r\nor less detail, but special prominence was given to the necessity for a\r\nresponsible Government--a Government responsible to public opinion,\r\nwhich must cease to exist when it ceases to command popular confidence.\r\nThe wished-for settlement of this important question would necessarily\r\ncomprehend and include the removal of many of the most glaring abuses to\r\nwhich the people of the Province had long been subject and the Reform\r\nparty were keenly alive to the importance of obtaining the concession.\r\nMore than a third of the Report proper was devoted to dealing with the\r\nquestion in its various aspects, and it was shown that the Provincial\r\nExecutive were not only impervious to public opinion, but were also\r\nready enough to disregard the views of the Home Government itself when\r\nthose views failed to coincide with their own plans for\r\nself-aggrandizement. Some of the evidence taken was of the most\r\ncompromising character, while the refusal of leading members of the\r\nCompact to answer certain questions propounded to them did not tend to\r\nplace matters in a more favourable light. Archdeacon Strachan's response\r\nto many of the questions put to him amounted to a practical contempt of\r\nthe Committee. \"I do not answer that question.\"--\"I have no answer to\r\ngive.\"--\"I refer you to the Constitutional Act.\"--\"I cannot answer that\r\nquestion, owing to its assumptions, which I do not admit.\" Such are a\r\nfew of his replies. The whole of his examination is worth reading, as\r\nexemplifying how far an intelligent man will sometimes permit bigotry\r\nand intolerance to gain possession of his soul. Indeed, the evidence of\r\nall the witnesses may be read with profit by those who wish to gain a\r\nfull insight into the state of the Province at that time, and to fully\r\nappreciate the necessity which existed for a change in the mode of\r\nconducting public affairs.\r\n\r\nThe report, though presented to the Assembly as above intimated, does\r\nnot appear to have been formally adopted during the session, but the\r\npassing of the order for the printing of it, together with two thousand\r\nextra copies, amounted to a practical adoption, and was probably so\r\nconsidered. The Committee could easily have secured its adoption, for\r\nthe vote on the Speakership had not fully represented the strength of\r\nthe Opposition, who on several questions were able to command a majority\r\nof from ten to eleven. But the fact was again brought vividly home to\r\nthe Reform party that mere success at the polls had availed them little.\r\nNotwithstanding the numerical minority of the official party in the\r\nAssembly, they continued to exercise supreme power, and to strengthen\r\nthemselves by the constant dispensing of patronage. They controlled the\r\nLegislative Council, and could thus control the legislative powers of\r\nthe Assembly, independently of any question of the numerical strength or\r\nweakness of the Opposition in that House. The Legislative Council now\r\nassumed an attitude of determined antagonism to the popular voice, and\r\nwould entertain no legislation of a liberal character. The vivid\r\nrealization of these facts gave a keen edge to the remarks on\r\nResponsible Government in the Grievance Committee's Report. An Address\r\nsetting forth these various discouragements was forwarded to His Majesty\r\nby the Assembly. The language was respectful but firm, and it was hinted\r\nthat, if a remedy were not provided, resort would have to be had to the\r\nextreme measure of withholding the usual supplies. Earnest petitions to\r\nHis Majesty were at the same time sent across the Atlantic from some of\r\nthe rural districts, praying that the principles of the British\r\nconstitution might be applied to Canadian affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Address and petitions were accompanied by the fullest documentary\r\nand other evidence, and, in conjunction with the Grievance Committee's\r\nReport, they stirred the Home Government to action. The Colonial\r\nSecretaryship had changed hands more than once since Mr. Stanley's\r\ntenure of office. The incumbent at this time, and for several years\r\nafterwards, was Lord Glenelg. His Lordship gave much consideration to\r\nthe Report, and laid it before the King in person. The Home Government\r\nhad by this time fully realized that there was much well-grounded\r\ndiscontent in the Canadas, and that something must be done to allay it.\r\nIt was clear that the Reformers were justified in at least some of their\r\ndemands, and that reasonable concessions should be made to them. This\r\nconviction led to an ungracious correspondence between the Colonial\r\nOffice and Sir John Colborne,[192] who, owing, as is to be presumed, to\r\nthe advice of Chief Justice Robinson and Archdeacon Strachan, was very\r\nreluctant to make concessions as suggested. As this reluctance was made\r\nmanifest in the course of the correspondence, the Colonial Secretary\r\nresolved upon His Excellency's recall. Sir John had been appointed by a\r\nTory Government, the traditions of which had been pretty well swept away\r\nby the effect of the Reform Bill. His mode of conducting the Provincial\r\nAdministration may perhaps be to some extent palliated by the\r\ncircumstances attending his appointment. But a Whig Government had now\r\nbeen for some time in power, and an effete colonial policy could not be\r\npermitted to be maintained to the detriment of colonial loyalty. If Sir\r\nJohn Colborne was not amenable to Whig discipline he must make way for\r\nsome one of a more plastic mind. He was meanwhile instructed to delay\r\nthe assembling of the Legislature until the Home Government could fully\r\nconsider the aspect of affairs, and take such steps for the redress of\r\nthe Provincial grievances as might seem advisable.\r\n\r\nHaving arrived at this conclusion, the Colonial Secretary began to look\r\nabout him for a successor to Sir John Colborne. It was not easy to find\r\none in all respects suitable, for the appointment was not a prize of\r\nsuch magnitude as to attract persons of really first-rate abilities.\r\nThere seems good reason to believe that the place was offered to at\r\nleast two fairly competent public servants, both of whom declined\r\nit.[193] In view of his subsequent conduct, it is fair to assume that\r\nLord Glenelg was sincerely anxious to do his best for Upper Canada, and\r\nto confer the appointment upon the best man within his reach. How\r\nignominously he failed to carry out his wishes in this particular is\r\nknown to every student of Upper Canadian history; but what is not known,\r\neither to students of history or anyone else, is--What was the motive\r\npower which directed his choice? By what whimsical combination of\r\ncircumstances it came about that the appointment was finally offered to,\r\nand accepted by, one of the most unlikely men in the three kingdoms, is\r\none of those official riddles which appear to defy solution. The fact\r\nremains, that the post of Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada was\r\nconferred upon Sir Francis Bond Head, a Knight of the Royal Hanoverian\r\nGuelphic Order, a retired half-pay Major, an Assistant Poor-Law\r\nCommissioner for one of the Kentish districts, and the author of several\r\nentertaining but exceedingly superficial books of travel. To no one was\r\nthe appointment a greater surprise than to Sir Francis himself. He must\r\nhave felt the utter absurdity of the thing--that he had no claim to such\r\na post, and was disqualified from filling it with credit. He neither\r\nknew nor cared anything about Canada. He was altogether ignorant of\r\npolitics. He had never joined any political party; never attended a\r\npolitical discussion; never even voted at an election or taken any part\r\nin one.[194] So far as any knowledge of the British constitution was\r\nconcerned, he had as little as any Englishman of decent education could\r\npossibly have. He had no claim upon the Government; was not acquainted\r\nwith any member of it; and had never so much as seen Lord Glenelg in his\r\nlife.[195] It is certainly not strange that he should have been, as he\r\nsays,[196] \"altogether at a loss to conceive\" why this appointment\r\nshould have been offered to him.\r\n\r\nFrom that day down to the present time the circumstance has puzzled\r\nwiser heads than his, and there have been various attempts to solve the\r\nmystery. A tradition is said to be current in the Colonial Office that\r\nthe appointment was the result of a singular misapprehension of\r\nidentity, and the late Mr. Roebuck assured Sir Francis Hincks that such\r\nwas really the fact.[197] A \"distinguished Imperial statesman\" also\r\nassured Sir Francis that he had heard the same statement,[198] which was\r\nto the effect that the person for whom the appointment was really\r\nintended was the kinsman of Sir Francis, afterwards Sir Edmund Walker\r\nHead, Governor-General of Canada. It is said that at a meeting of the\r\nCabinet, while the selection of a successor to Sir John Colborne was\r\nunder consideration, one of the Ministers suggested that \"young Head\"\r\nwould be a likely man for the position--the person meant being Edmund\r\nWalker Head, who was even then known as possessing wide political\r\nknowledge, in so far, at least, as such knowledge can be obtained from\r\nbooks. Edmund was moreover known to many public men in Great Britain as\r\nan able writer on political subjects, and was a protege of the Marquis\r\nof Lansdowne, who was at this time President of the Council, and, by\r\nconsequence, a colleague of Lord Glenelg. Edmund, as well as Francis,\r\nwas a Poor-Law Commissioner, though he occupied a more exalted position\r\nthan his kinsman. Thus, it is argued, there was some show of excuse for\r\nconfusing the one with the other. Lord Glenelg, so the story goes, took\r\nthe suggestion of his colleague as applying to Sir Francis, and acted\r\nupon it; and before the error was discovered the appointment had been\r\noffered to and accepted by the wrong man.[199] How much truth there may\r\nbe in this account of the matter it is not easy to say. Such a blunder\r\nwould imply an amount of carelessness barely conceivable in the\r\nmanagement of an important Department of the State. Sir Francis Hincks,\r\nhowever, who has enjoyed exceptional opportunities of discussing the\r\nstory with leading English statesmen, is strongly disposed to believe\r\nit.[200] Whatever opinion may be formed as to its truth or falsity,\r\ncertain it is that Sir Francis Bond Head received the appointment, and\r\nthat his conduct in Upper Canada did more to alienate the minds of the\r\ncolonists generally than anything which had been done by either Sir John\r\nColborne or Sir Peregrine Maitland. There is this to be said on his\r\nbehalf: that he came to Canada at a very critical time--at a time when\r\ndiplomatic shrewdness and statesmanlike sagacity were imperatively\r\ndemanded of one occupying the position of Lieutenant-Governor. Injustice\r\nhad so long borne sway in the land that many of the inhabitants had\r\nceased to hope for better times. Many despaired of the future, and a\r\nfew, whose natural element was opposition, had little desire to be\r\nconciliated.[201] Even a born statesman would have found his task by no\r\nmeans a sinecure.\r\n\r\nTo statesmanship no shadow of pretence could be made on behalf of Sir\r\nFrancis Head. The texture of his mind was light and airy. He was\r\ninordinately vain and self-conscious; and, as has been seen, he was\r\ndevoid of political knowledge and experience. The whole course of his\r\nprevious life had been of a character to render him unfit for such\r\ngreatness as was now thrust upon him. A considerable part of it had been\r\nspent in travel and adventure, and very little of it in study. He had\r\nleft school at an early age, since which time he had encountered\r\ninnumerable moving accidents by flood and field in various parts of the\r\nworld. He had received a certain amount of training at the Military\r\nAcademy at Woolwich, and had obtained a commission in the Royal\r\nEngineers in his nineteenth year. He had seen some active service in\r\nSpain towards the close of the Peninsular War; had been present at\r\nQuatre Bras and Waterloo, and had fought at Fleurus under the Prussian\r\nGeneral Ziethan, where he had had his horse shot under him. After the\r\nrestoration of peace he had for some time been engaged in making a\r\ntrigonometrical survey of the island of Lampedoza, in the Mediterranean.\r\nThence he had embarked in a Greek vessel for Tripoli; had been nearly\r\nwrecked through the skipper's intemperance, and had finally been put\r\nashore at Malta. He had also been Byron-smitten, and had followed in the\r\nwake of the author of \"Childe Harold\" to the Levant; had contemplated\r\n\"the Niobe of nations\" among the ruins of Rome; had witnessed the dance\r\nof the dervishes amid the fallen temples of Athens; and had \"felt his\r\npatriotism gain force upon the plain of Marathon.\"[202] He had twice\r\nvisited South America as the agent of a company formed for the working\r\nof certain gold and silver mines, and known as the Rio de la Plata\r\nMining Association. During one of these expeditions he had ridden on\r\nhorseback from the port of Buenos Aires across the pampas to the silver\r\nmines of Upsallata, near the foot of the Andes, whence, without any\r\ncompanion whatever, he had galloped back to Buenos Aires--a distance of\r\nnearly a thousand miles--in the brief space of eight days. Then he had\r\nretraced his course across the pampas, and, collecting a party of miners\r\nat Mendoza, had conducted them over the Andes to Santiago, the capital\r\nof Chili. After \"prospecting\" the country in various directions, he had\r\nridden back across the Andes and the pampas to Buenos Aires, having\r\ntraversed six thousand miles on horseback in an inconceivably short\r\ntime. His \"Rough Notes\" contains a graphic account of this expedition,\r\nand is very interesting reading. It won for him wide notoriety, and led\r\nto his being commonly referred to in the current literature of the time\r\nas \"Galloping Head.\" His adventurous career had left an indelible stamp\r\nupon his character. He was rash, impetuous, inconsiderate and\r\nsuperficial, fond of producing dramatic effects, and ever with an eye to\r\nsome _coup de theatre_. He had not been a Poor-Law Commissioner long\r\nenough to have become thoroughly settled down when a king's messenger\r\narrived at his Kentish abode about midnight, with a missive offering him\r\nthe appointment of Lieutenant-Governor of Upper Canada. He seems to have\r\nat first had sufficient good sense to decline the proffered honour; but\r\nhe allowed himself to be talked into accepting it by Lord Glenelg and\r\nhis under-secretary, Mr. Stephen. As I have said elsewhere: \"The result\r\nof an appointment made under such circumstances was disaster to the\r\nProvince, and something nearly approaching ignominy to himself. As a\r\ncivil administrator in a disturbed and grievance-ridden colony, he was\r\naltogether out of his proper element, and furnished a signal instance of\r\nthe round peg in the square hole. His administration extended over\r\nlittle more than two years, but during that period he contrived to\r\nembroil himself with his own Executive, with the Home Government from\r\nwhich he had received his appointment, and with pretty nearly every one\r\nwho was desirous of promoting the cause of political liberty in Upper\r\nCanada. He also contrived to do an amount of mischief which left traces\r\nbehind it for many years after he had ceased to have any control over\r\nCanadian affairs. And yet it would be most unjust to represent him as a\r\ndeliberately bad or ill-intentioned man. He was simply a weak man out of\r\nhis proper sphere.\"[203] That a man of such mental endowments should\r\nhave been sent out to stem the tide of Upper Canadian discontent, and to\r\nconciliate noisy Radicals of the Mackenzie stamp, is in itself\r\nsufficient proof that a huge official blunder of some sort was\r\ncommitted. What was wanted was a statesman, and a man of Liberal\r\npolitical views. Had there been any, even the slightest inquiry, it\r\nwould have been ascertained that Sir Francis hardly knew the meaning of\r\nthe word statesman, and that he had no political views whatever. It is\r\nhardly going too far to say that on all current political subjects,\r\nwhether pertaining to the colonies or the mother country, his mind was\r\nlittle more than a blank. Lord Glenelg had an elaborate paper of\r\ninstructions prepared for the new Lieutenant-Governor, This was intended\r\nas the Imperial response to the strong representations which had been\r\nreceived from Upper Canada in the course of the year. Sir Francis was\r\ndirected to communicate the substance of his instructions to both Houses\r\nof the Provincial Parliament. Having been schooled for a few days by Mr.\r\nStephen, and having gone down to Brighton and been presented to the\r\nKing, he set sail, with his suite, from Liverpool for Canada, by way of\r\nNew York. While crossing the Atlantic he devoted some time to studying\r\nhis instructions, together with the Seventh Report of the Grievance\r\nCommittee, with which he had been provided at the Colonial office.[204]\r\nUpon arriving at New York he pushed on to his final destination. \"There\r\nwould be no end to this chapter,\" he writes, in the third chapter of his\r\n\"Narrative,\" \"were I to describe the simplicity of mind, ill-naturedly\r\ncalled ignorance, with which I approached the city of Toronto. With Mr.\r\nMackenzie's heavy book of lamentations in my portmanteau, and with my\r\nremedial instructions in my writing case, I considered myself as a\r\npolitical physician, who, whether regularly educated or not, was about\r\nto effect a surprising cure; for, as I never doubted for a moment either\r\nthe existence of the 553 pages of grievances, nor that I would\r\nmercilessly destroy them, root and branch, I felt perfectly confident\r\nthat I should very soon be able proudly to report that the grievances of\r\nUpper Canada were defunct--in fact, that I had veni-ed, vidi-ed and\r\nvici-ed them.\" Infatuated man, to compare himself to Caesar, even in this\r\nhalf-jocular manner, at such a time, and to suppose that the bitter\r\nanimosities which had been accumulating for the best part of a\r\ngeneration could be swept out of existence at the mere wave of the hand\r\nof such a weak substitute for \"the mighty Julius\" as he!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1836.]\r\n\r\nHe reached Toronto on the 23rd of January, 1836. Sir John Colborne was\r\njust ready to take his departure, to the great regret of the official\r\nparty, and very much to the delight of the Reformers, who had been led\r\nto believe that the incoming Lieutenant-Governor was a thorough-going\r\nLiberal, sent over expressly to redress their grievances, and to hurl\r\nthe Compact from the seat of power which they had so long usurped.\r\nParliament had been assembled on the 14th of the month, and had ever\r\nsince been expecting the arrival of the King's new representative. As\r\nfor Sir John Colborne, he was in no good humour with the Imperial\r\nGovernment, although his rigid ideas as to discipline prevented him from\r\ngiving utterance to his displeasure except to some of the members of the\r\nExecutive, and even to them his views were imparted with great caution,\r\nand in the strictest secrecy.[205] In consequence of his unsatisfactory\r\ncommunications from the Colonial Office, he had for some time felt his\r\nposition growing more and more uncomfortable, and had solicited his\r\nrecall; but his deposition had been fully resolved upon before the\r\nreceipt of his request by the Colonial Secretary. He had served out his\r\nfull term of six years, and somewhat more, so that his removal did not\r\nimply any reflection upon him. His nature and training unfitted him to\r\ncarry out the projects of Reform which it had been determined to set on\r\nfoot, but, in his proper sphere, he was recognized as a valuable public\r\nservant, who had all his life done his duty according to the light which\r\nhad been vouchsafed to him. The leading spirits of the ruling party in\r\nthe Province contemplated his departure with gloomy forebodings. They\r\nalso had been led to suppose that Sir Francis Head was a Reformer of\r\nwide experience, who was coming among them to introduce a new order of\r\nthings. They resolved to put forth one great effort while the chance\r\nremained to them. They induced Sir John, before his departure, to\r\nperpetrate what may fitly be characterized as the most unstatesmanlike\r\nact of his life: an act which aroused a perfect transport of public\r\nindignation, and caused the name of the perpetrator to be execrated\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of the Province.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that[206] provision had been made by the\r\nConstitutional Act for the creation and endowment, out of the lands\r\nreserved for the support of a Protestant Clergy, of parsonages or\r\nrectories, according to the establishment of the Church of England. The\r\ndiscussion to which the Clergy Reserves had repeatedly given rise had\r\nprevented any advantage being taken of this authority. Nearly half a\r\ncentury had elapsed since the passing of the Constitutional Act, and as\r\nthe power had been allowed to remain unexercised during all that time,\r\nthere was good reason to believe that there would be no attempt to put\r\nit in operation, more especially in view of the strong feeling\r\nentertained with regard to the Reserves, and of the fact that the\r\nProvincial Parliament had been requested by the Imperial Government to\r\nlegislate on the subject. Previous Colonial Secretaries, Lord Goderich\r\namong the number, had given what might fairly be construed as pledges on\r\nthe part of the Imperial Government that no steps would be taken with\r\nrespect to the disposal of any part of the Reserves, unless in accord\r\nwith the views of a majority of the Upper Canadian people. Yet Sir John\r\nallowed himself to be persuaded into creating and endowing forty-four\r\nrectories[207] with more that 17,000 acres of land, giving an average of\r\nabout 386 acres to each. These were put in possession of clergymen, who\r\nwere thus enabled to acquire such a personal vested and possessory\r\ninterest in the lands as, it was believed, would enable them to make\r\ngood their titles thereto in a court of law.\r\n\r\nThis most reprehensible \"clerical land grab\" was made on the 15th of\r\nJanuary, eight days before the arrival of Sir John Colborne's successor,\r\nand while Sir Francis was actually _en route_ for Toronto. It was thus\r\none of Sir John's last official acts. It is said that he was with\r\ndifficulty brought to accede to the advice of his Council on the\r\nsubject. He at all events seemed to feel that his creation of the\r\nrectories was an extraordinary act, and he took care to say nothing\r\nabout the matter to the Imperial Government, who did not discover the\r\nfacts until Sir Francis Head had been for some time in office. That the\r\ncreation and endowment of the rectories were the means of greatly\r\nintensifying the general discontent throughout the Province, and that\r\nthey were thus factors in bringing about the Rebellion, is beyond\r\nquestion; though to say, as has been said by Mackenzie and others, that\r\nthey were the _prime_ factors, is to talk nonsense. The sequel of the\r\nstory may as well be briefly outlined here. The Executive Council kept\r\nthe matter secret as long as they could, but it was of such a nature\r\nthat its early disclosure was inevitable. The transaction became public\r\nproperty in the course of the spring, soon after the close of the\r\nsession of Parliament. No sooner did it become known than the public\r\nindignation began to manifest itself in lurid speeches and newspaper\r\narticles. Meetings were held to denounce Sir John Colborne and those who\r\nhad prompted him to this high-handed iniquity. The Wesleyan Methodist\r\nConference and the Synod of the Church of Scotland in Upper Canada, if\r\nagreeing on no other subject, were of one mind as to this, and\r\nofficially pronounced upon it with a vehemence which commended itself to\r\npopular opinion. Petitions without number were sent over the sea. \"The\r\nImperial Government,\" says Mr. Lindsey,[208] \"was besieged with\r\npetitions, praying for the annulment of the rectories. The temper of the\r\npublic mind became imbued with that sullenness which a sense of injury\r\nbegets, and which forebodes the approach of civil commotion. It was the\r\nidea of violated Imperial faith; of a broken compact between the\r\nSovereign and his Canadian subjects, that constituted the sting of the\r\ninjury. The people recurred to the promise of Lord Goderich that their\r\nwishes should be the Sovereign's guide in the matter, and regarded\r\nthemselves as the victims of a deception which brought dishonour on the\r\nCrown and distrust on Imperial faith.\" The Home Government were in two\r\nminds about repudiating the transaction. The right of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor to create and endow without the express assent of\r\nthe King was not perfectly clear, and the Law Officers of the Crown were\r\nconsulted on the question. Those gentlemen, on the case submitted for\r\ntheir consideration, pronounced the opinion that there had been an\r\nexcess of authority, and that the creation and endowment were invalid.\r\nDr. Strachan, upon becoming acquainted with this circumstance, prepared\r\na report embodying certain facts and documents which had not been before\r\nthe Law Officers, to whom the case was now submitted a second time. The\r\nadditional data placed a different face upon the question, and the Law\r\nOfficers arrived at a conclusion contrary to that which they had\r\nformerly expressed. The grantees were accordingly permitted to retain\r\ntheir property undisturbed, but the name of Sir John Colborne continued\r\nto be execrated in Upper Canada for his share in the transaction for\r\nmany a year.[209]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[191] _Ante_, pp. 231, 232.\r\n\r\n[192] See _Report of a Select Committee of the House of Assembly on the\r\nPolitical State of the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada_, p. 25.\r\nToronto, 1838.\r\n\r\n[193] See _Rough Notes on Head's Narrative_, by a Liberal, p. 17.\r\nLondon, 1840.\r\n\r\n[194] See his _Narrative_, Chapter III.\r\n\r\n[195] _Narrative_, Chapter II.\r\n\r\n[196] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[197] See _Reminiscences of his Public Life_, by Sir Francis Hincks,\r\nK.C.M.G., C.B. p. 14.

B. Head, that it was unaware\r\nof the importance of the crisis in colonial affairs. In the beginning of\r\nthe instructions prepared for Sir Francis, dated \"Downing Street,\r\nDecember 15th, 1835,\" the following words may be found: \"I have the\r\nhonour herewith to transmit to you a Commission, under His Majesty's\r\nsign-manual, appointing you Lieutenant-Governor of the Province of Upper\r\nCanada. You have been selected for this office at an era of more\r\ndifficulty and importance than any which has hitherto occurred in the\r\nhistory of that part of His Majesty's dominions. The expression of\r\nconfidence in your discretion and ability which the choice implies would\r\nonly be weakened by any more formal assurance which I could convey to\r\nyou.\" What a commentary upon such language was furnished by the mere\r\nfact of the appointment of such an one as Sir Francis Head!\r\n\r\n[202] See a brief account of Sir F. B. Head's life published in _The\r\nCourier of Upper Canada_ of June 11th, 1836, written by Alan Fairford\r\n(John Kent), and prefixed, with notes, to the collection of his\r\nExcellency's _Speeches, Messages and Replies_, published at Toronto\r\nduring the same year.\r\n\r\n[203] _Canadian Portrait Gallery_, Vol. II., p. 169, where the sentences\r\nabove quoted form part of a tolerably full sketch of the life of Sir F.\r\nB.

He was not a little surprised, as he rode\r\nalong the streets, to see himself placarded in large letters on the\r\nwalls as \"Sir Francis Head, a Tried Reformer.\" What a farce the thing\r\nmust have appeared in his eyes, knowing, as he did, that up to the date\r\nof receiving the king's messenger, he had never read a page of practical\r\npolitics; that he had never recorded a political vote, and that he was\r\nat this present moment, to use his own frank expression, no more\r\nconnected with human politics than the horses that were drawing him! How\r\nhe must have marvelled at Fate for playing him such a trick! On the same\r\nday, at the urgent request of Sir John Colborne, he removed to\r\nGovernment House. On Monday, the 25th, he was sworn into office as\r\nLieutenant-Governor; and on Tuesday Sir John and his family took their\r\ndeparture for Montreal. The Compact took care that their staunch friend\r\nshould not leave the seat of his Government without some mark of what\r\nmight pass for popular favour. A crowd of persons was got together to\r\ncheer as Sir John passed along the streets on his way eastward, and a\r\nstranger might have been excused for believing that the\r\nex-Lieutenant-Governor was regarded by the populace with feelings of the\r\nwarmest affection. He proceeded to Montreal, and had arranged to sail\r\nfrom New York for England, when he received a despatch appointing him\r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Forces in Canada. He accordingly repaired to\r\nQuebec, the capital of the Lower Province, which was already in a state\r\nof ferment, and preparing for the outburst which ensued towards the\r\nclose of the following year.\r\n\r\nSir Francis being now formally installed in office, an era of Reform was\r\ncommonly supposed to have begun. His manner and address were in the\r\nhighest degree pleasing, and he at first produced a most favourable\r\nimpression upon all who came within the immediate circle of his\r\ninfluence. The Reform press sang paeans in his praise. He held no sooner\r\nreceived his appointment than Joseph Hume had written to Mackenzie\r\ncongratulating the Province on the circumstance, and stating that the\r\nconduct and principles of Sir Francis had been much approved of. \"My\r\nanxiety is,\" wrote Mr. Hume, \"that you and all the Reformers should\r\nreceive Sir Francis in the best possible manner, and do everything\r\nconsistent with principle to meet his views and wishes.\"[210] The fact\r\nwas that Mr. Hume was in precisely the same condition as Lord Glenelg\r\nhimself with respect to Sir Francis: that is to say, he knew nothing\r\nwhatever about him. He seems to have very unwisely taken it for granted\r\nthat the new Lieutenant-Governor was a good man for the position because\r\nhe had been appointed under Whig auspices. His letter found its way into\r\nall the Reform newspapers in Upper Canada, and Sir Francis had no reason\r\nto complain of the treatment he received at their hands. He was welcomed\r\nas the \"Tried Reformer\" for whom they had so long prayed in vain. The\r\nTories and Conservatives, on the other hand, naturally regarded him with\r\nconsiderable apprehension. They entertained no doubt that his advent\r\nboded their downfall; but they were too wise to betray any solicitude,\r\nand quietly waited the march of events. Parliament being in session, he\r\nreceived from both Houses congratulatory addresses upon his assumption\r\nof the Government. On the 27th he went down to the Council Chamber, and\r\nmade a brief and rather meaningless speech to the Legislature.[211] \"As\r\nregards myself,\" said he, \"I have nothing either to promise or profess,\r\nbut I trust I shall not call in vain upon you to give me that loyal,\r\nconstitutional, unbiased and fearless assistance which your King\r\nexpects, and which the rising interests of your country require.\" He had\r\nbeen directed by Lord Glenelg to communicate to the Provincial\r\nLegislature the substance of his instructions. He not only communicated\r\nthe substance, but a verbatim copy of the letter itself, together with a\r\ncopy of the appendix, to each of the Houses. By this injudicious\r\nproceeding he caused no little embarrassment to the Colonial Secretary,\r\nand proved his utter want of experience in diplomatic affairs.[212] Lord\r\nGlenelg, in common with the official world of Great Britain generally,\r\nfelt and expressed strong disapprobation of this extraordinary conduct\r\non the part of the Lieutenant-Governor, who ought to have been recalled\r\nfor this act alone, and probably would have been but for the difficulty\r\nof finding a competent man to succeed him.\r\n\r\nA certain space must be devoted to an examination of these instructions.\r\nSpeaking generally, it may be premised that they showed a disposition to\r\nconciliate the discontent of the colonists, but only after a partial and\r\npiecemeal fashion, such as might be exercised towards persons in a state\r\nof tutelage. It was evident that the Home Government regarded the\r\ncolonists as persons who had not reached full political stature, who\r\nwere not in all cases able to judge as to what was best for themselves,\r\nand who needed the constant supervision of calmer and loftier\r\nintelligences than their own. In reply to the allegation that the number\r\nof public offices in the colony was in excess of the people's needs, it\r\nwas said that in Upper Canada, as in other new countries, the number of\r\npublic employments was necessarily larger in proportion than in older\r\nand more densely-peopled states. \"In the early stages of such a\r\nsociety,\" wrote Lord Glenelg, \"many duties devolve upon the Government\r\nwhich, at a more advanced period, are undertaken by the better educated\r\nand wealthier classes, as an honourable occupation of their leisure\r\ntime.\" He went on to say that His Majesty's Government were not\r\nsolicitous to retain more patronage than was necessary for the people's\r\nwelfare, but that the selection of public officers must be entrusted to\r\nthe head of the local Government, and could not wisely be exercised in\r\nany form of popular election, or committed to any popular body. Such\r\nexercise or transfer, it was suggested, would be destructive of\r\nresponsibility and discipline. This doctrine was laid down as a general\r\nrule of action, but any wish to urge it beyond its just and necessary\r\nlimits was expressly disclaimed, and it was even suggested that there\r\nwere cases in which the doctrine might be contravened. There was no\r\nattempt to go into details as to specific cases, but it was stated as a\r\ngeneral principle that whatever patronage was necessary to maintain\r\nperfect subordination to the prerogatives of the Crown must be retained,\r\nand that whatever was unnecessary for that purpose should be abandoned.\r\nHis Excellency was directed to review and consider the subject with\r\ndiligence, and to report the result of his investigation. Should he\r\nmeanwhile deem it wise to reduce the number of offices, either by\r\nabolition or consolidation, he was authorized to exercise his discretion\r\nin that respect, but any appointment made under such circumstances was\r\nto be merely provisional, and subject to cancellation by the Home\r\nGovernment. In the selection of persons for public offices his\r\nExcellency was to be guided exclusively by the comparison of the claims\r\nof the candidates by reason of past services or personal qualifications;\r\nand as a general rule no person was to be appointed to office who was\r\nnot either a native of the Province or a settled inhabitant of it.\r\nExceptions to this latter rule were admitted where a knowledge of some\r\nparticular art or science was demanded, and where no Provincial\r\ncandidate could be found possessing the necessary qualifications. His\r\nExcellency was also left free from restriction in the choice of those\r\nofficers immediately attached to his own person. There were various\r\nother directions, not necessary to be specified, on the subjects of\r\npatronage and pensions, salaries and fees, and the Provincial Post\r\nOffice. The Clergy Reserves question was dealt with in the most general\r\nmanner, no definite course being suggested; and the instructions on this\r\nsubject are absolutely devoid of historical or other value. With regard\r\nto the Land-Granting Department, it was assumed that some of the\r\ngrievances had been remedied. Reference was made to a despatch of Lord\r\nRipon's on the subject, and it was stated that any ambiguity therein was\r\nto be removed, while prompt obedience to the instructions embodied\r\ntherein was inculcated. Upper Canada College, established by Sir John\r\nColborne only five years before this time, had already become a ground\r\nof offence to many Reformers. The Assembly, in their Address to His\r\nMajesty, had declared that it was upheld at great public expense, with\r\nhigh salaries to its principal masters. They had expressed the opinion\r\nthat the Province in general derived very little advantage from it, and\r\nthat it might be dispensed with. On this subject Lord Glenelg remarked\r\nthat there was no desire to retain any charge for the establishment more\r\nthan sufficient to suitably provide for the effective performance of the\r\nteachers; but the advantages of such an institution, it was said, ought\r\nto be great, and if the Province derived no benefit from it the\r\nexplanation was to be found in some error of management susceptible of\r\nremedy. His Lordship remarked that he should deeply lament the abolition\r\nof a college \"of which the defects would appear so remediable, and of\r\nwhich it does not seem easy to exaggerate the benefits.\" As for King's\r\nCollege, which was another educational bone of contention between the\r\ntwo branches of the Provincial Legislature, it was intimated that His\r\nMajesty would cheerfully resume the consideration of the charter,\r\nprovided the assent of both Houses to his doing so could be obtained,\r\nbut that, as the subject had been committed to the local Legislature, he\r\ncould not withdraw it from their cognizance at the instance of one\r\nbranch only. The system of auditing the public accounts had been\r\ncomplained of as being insufficient for ensuring the proper application\r\nof the revenue. As a remedy, the establishment of a Board of Audit, the\r\nregulation of which should be secured by well-considered legislation,\r\nhad been suggested. In this suggestion the Colonial Secretary expressed\r\nhis concurrence, and he transmitted various documents explanatory of the\r\nsystem of auditing the public accounts of the Kingdom. The Assembly\r\nhaving expressed its belief that the Legislative Council would not\r\nassent to any efficient legislation on the subject, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor was empowered, in case of that belief being\r\nrealized, to constitute a provisional Board of Audit. To remedy another\r\nevil which had been complained of--the withholding of public accounts\r\nfrom the Assembly--it was proposed that a statute should be passed\r\nproviding the time and manner of making periodical returns, and naming\r\nthe officers who should render them to the Legislature. Then followed\r\nbrief instructions to be observed by the Lieutenant-Governor in his\r\nintercourse with the Assembly. \"You will always,\" wrote his Lordship,\r\n\"receive the addresses of the Assembly with the most studious attention\r\nand courtesy. As far as may be consistent with your duty to the King,\r\nyou will accede to their wishes cheerfully and frankly. Should that duty\r\never compel you to differ from their opinion, or to decline compliance\r\nwith their desires, you will explain in the most direct, and of course\r\nin the most conciliatory terms, the ground of your conduct.\" His\r\nExcellency was instructed to adopt Lord Goderich's despatch to Sir John\r\nColborne of the 8th of November, 1832,[213] as a rule for the guidance\r\nof his conduct. He was directed to select Justices of the Peace without\r\nreference to political considerations. In the Grievance Committee's\r\nReport, as well as in the Address from the Assembly to the King, great\r\nstress had been laid on the mode of appointing members of the\r\nLegislative Council. It had been represented that that body had utterly\r\nfailed to answer the ends for which it had been created, and that the\r\nrestoration of legislative harmony and good government required its\r\nreconstruction on the elective principle.[214] The inhabitants of the\r\nLower Province felt still more strongly on this subject than did their\r\nfellow-colonists in Upper Canada, and had made urgent representations to\r\nHis Majesty thereupon in ninety-two resolutions which had been adopted\r\nby the local Assembly during the session of 1834. \"The greatest defect\r\nin the constitution of Canada,\" said they, \"is the right of nomination,\r\nby the Crown, of the Legislative Councillors.\" These resolutions had led\r\nto the appointment by the Imperial Government of a commission of\r\ninvestigation into the affairs of Lower Canada, and as the principles\r\nbearing upon the question of an elective Legislative Council were the\r\nsame in both Provinces, Lord Glenelg now contented himself with\r\nappending the instructions issued to the commissioners, and referring to\r\nthe views therein contained as having received the deliberate sanction\r\nof the King. A similar device was adopted with respect to the demand for\r\nthe control by the Assembly of the territorial and casual revenues of\r\nthe Crown.\r\n\r\nThe one great overshadowing question of Executive responsibility was\r\ndealt with by Lord Glenelg in a most perfunctory and unsatisfactory\r\nmanner. It was apparent that he either wholly failed to grasp the real\r\nsignificance of the theme, or that he fenced with it for the mere\r\npurpose of beguiling the colonists with a counterfeit presentment.\r\n\"Experience would seem to prove,\" he wrote, \"that the administration of\r\npublic affairs in Canada is by no means exempt from the control of a\r\nsufficient practical responsibility. To His Majesty and to Parliament\r\nthe Governor of Upper Canada is at all times most fully responsible for\r\nhis official acts. That this responsibility is not merely nominal, but\r\nthat His Majesty feels the most lively interest in the welfare of his\r\nCanadian subjects, and is ever anxious to devote a patient and laborious\r\nattention to any representations which they may address to him, either\r\nthrough their representatives or as individuals, is proved not only by\r\nthe whole tenor of the correspondence of my predecessors in this office,\r\nbut by the despatch which I am now addressing to you. That the Imperial\r\nParliament is not disposed to receive with inattention the\r\nrepresentations of their Canadian fellow-subjects is attested by the\r\nlabours of the committees which have been appointed by the House of\r\nCommons during the last few years to inquire into matters relating to\r\nthose Provinces.\" It was declared to be the Lieutenant-Governor's duty\r\nto vindicate to the King and the Imperial Parliament every act of his\r\nadministration. In the event of any complaint being preferred against\r\nhim, his conduct was to receive the most favourable construction. The\r\nAssembly, it was said, were at all times able to invoke the\r\ninterference of the King and Parliament. Every public officer was\r\nto depend on the King's pleasure--_i.e._, upon the pleasure of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor--for the tenure of his office. Certain rules were\r\nthen laid down, the observance of which, it was said, would produce a\r\nsystem of perfect responsibility. As these rules differed in no\r\nessential respect from those which had consistently been acted upon by\r\nFrancis Gore, Sir Peregrine Maitland and Sir John Colborne, it was\r\nevident that the system of responsibility contemplated by Lord Glenelg\r\nwas not identical with that desired by Upper Canadian Reformers. Lord\r\nGlenelg certainly made good his asseveration that the Upper Canadian\r\nExecutive were \"practically responsible.\" But to whom were they\r\nresponsible? To the Upper Canadian people? Not at all. The\r\nresponsibility was to the King and Parliament of Great Britain--that is\r\nto say, to Downing Street, several thousand miles away. Of what avail\r\nwas such responsibility, guarded, as it was, by secret despatches, \"like\r\na system of espionage\"?[215] Had this responsibility to Downing Street\r\never saved \"a single martyr to Executive displeasure\"?[216] Had it been\r\nof any avail for the protection of Robert Gourlay, Captain Matthews,\r\nFrancis Collins or Robert Randal? Had it preserved from the dry pan and\r\nthe slow fire any one of a score of individuals whose only offence\r\nagainst the State was that they would not willingly sacrifice their\r\nrights, and become the tools of venality and corruption? In not one\r\nsolitary instance had it served any such purpose. Such responsibility\r\nwas a mockery, \"a broken reed, which it would be folly ever again to\r\nrest upon.\"[217] Of real, constitutional responsibility to the people\r\nthere was not so much as a pretence. \"All the powers of the Government,\"\r\nsays Mr. Lindsey, \"were centralized in Downing Street, and all the\r\ncolonial officers, from the highest to the lowest, were puppets in the\r\nhands of the Secretary of State for the Colonies. At the same time, the\r\noutward trappings of a constitutional system, intended to amuse the\r\ncolonists, served no other end than to irritate and exasperate men who\r\nhad penetration enough to detect the mockery, and whose self-respect\r\nmade them abhor the sham.\"[218]\r\n\r\nIn an early paragraph of these instructions, Lord Glenelg had objected,\r\non behalf of His Majesty's Government, to any resort on the part of the\r\nAssembly to that ulterior measure--the stoppage of the supplies--to\r\nwhich allusion had been made in the Address of that body, and had\r\nreferred to it as a proceeding to be justified only by an extreme\r\nemergency. He concluded with an expression of earnest hope that the\r\nrepresentatives of the Upper Canadian people would receive with\r\ngratitude and cordiality this renewed proof of His Majesty's paternal\r\nsolicitude for the welfare of his loyal subjects in the Province, and\r\nthat, laying aside all groundless distrusts, they would cheerfully\r\ncooeperate with the King and the Lieutenant-Governor in advancing the\r\nprosperity of \"that interesting and valuable portion of the British\r\nEmpire.\"\r\n\r\nAs already mentioned, the full text of the instructions was communicated\r\nby the new Lieutenant-Governor to the Upper Canadian Assembly. Apart\r\nfrom the fact that this proceeding was not warranted either by usage or\r\nexpress permission, it was short-sighted and unwise, for the\r\ninstructions were not such as to be by any means satisfactory, either to\r\nthe official party or the Opposition. The Opposition perceived that,\r\nunder a cover of many fair words and specious phrases, there was very\r\nlittle substantial concession. To the official party it seemed that the\r\nspirit of concession was manifested much too strongly, and as the\r\nappointment of Sir Francis Head had been hailed by the Reformers as a\r\ntriumph, anything in the nature of concession, filtered through such a\r\nmedium, was naturally regarded with strong suspicion. As for Sir Francis\r\nhimself, his mind seems to have been for some weeks in a chaotic state.\r\nHe had not been installed in office many days before he had a succession\r\nof private interviews with several leading members of the Reform party.\r\nIn the course of a conversation with Mr. Bidwell, who, it will be\r\nremembered, was Speaker of the Assembly, he for the first time became\r\naware that the Report of the Grievance Committee was not recognized by\r\nthe Reform party as being a complete exposition of the case as between\r\nthe Home Government and themselves.[219] He soon after had an interview\r\nwith Mackenzie, who, in conjunction with Dr. Morrison, was chiefly\r\nresponsible for the existence of the Report. \"I thought,\" writes Sir\r\nFrancis,[220] \"that of course he would be too happy to discuss with me\r\nthe contents of his own book, but his mind seemed to nauseate its\r\nsubjects even more than Mr. Bidwell's. Afraid to look me in the face, he\r\nsat, with his feet not reaching the ground, and with his countenance\r\naverted from me, at an angle of about seventy degrees; while, with the\r\neccentricity, the volubility, and indeed the appearance of a madman, the\r\ntiny creature raved about grievances here and grievances there, which\r\nthe Committee, he said, had not ventured to enumerate.\" This was a\r\nrevelation to the Lieutenant-Governor, and set him thinking. He\r\nattempted to discuss the merits of the Report with various persons, but\r\nencountered what was to him an inexplicable reluctance to talk about it.\r\nAll were ready to discuss the grievances themselves, but no leading\r\nReformer was disposed to admit the Report into the discussion. The\r\nreason of this was doubtless because the Report had been chiefly\r\nfathered by Mackenzie, and they were unwilling to accept him as their\r\nmouthpiece. As for Mackenzie's own disinclination to enter into a\r\ndiscussion of the matter, it probably arose from a feeling that it would\r\nbe unwise for him to tie himself down to a particular record, beyond\r\nwhich he would not be permitted to travel. Sir Francis, writing three\r\nyears afterwards, declares that \"the light of truth\" at once burst upon\r\nhis mind, and that he perceived that the Grievance Report was a mere\r\npretext for Rebellion.[221] It is quite clear that he perceived nothing\r\nof the kind, and that \"the light of truth\" was a mere after-thought with\r\nhim. It is impossible for one in his sober senses to see what does not\r\nexist, and at this time there was no purpose of rebellion in the heart\r\nof anyone with whom the Lieutenant-Governor came in contact--not even in\r\nthe heart of Mackenzie himself, who might easily have been conciliated\r\nby wisdom and prudence. Had Sir Francis been half as clever and astute\r\nas he professed to believe himself to be--nay, had he even been fairly\r\nhonest and truthful, and possessed of the most ordinary good\r\nsense--there would probably have been no such thing as an Upper Canadian\r\nRebellion.\r\n\r\nHe had not been a fortnight in the country when suggestions began to be\r\nmade to him from various quarters as to the membership of the Executive\r\nCouncil. That body, for the nonce, consisted of only three persons,\r\nnamely, Peter Robinson, Commissioner of Crown Lands; George Herchmer\r\nMarkland, Inspector-General; and Joseph Wells, Bursar of King's\r\nCollege. The presence of all three of these persons was necessary to the\r\nformation of a quorum, and in case of the illness or unavoidable absence\r\nof any one of them the public business would have been interrupted and\r\ndelayed. Mr. Robinson, moreover, was not only an Executive Councillor,\r\nbut, as just mentioned, was also Commissioner of Crown Lands. In the\r\nformer capacity the duty was imposed upon him of taking part in the\r\nauditing of his own accounts. This invidious necessity would no longer\r\nexist if additional members were appointed, as a quorum could easily be\r\nobtained without Mr. Robinson's presence being required at the Council\r\nBoard. These facts were indisputable, and the argument to be deduced\r\ntherefrom was unanswerable. Additional Councillors must be appointed.\r\nBut from what class of the community should they be selected? Sir\r\nFrancis, the \"Tried Reformer,\" had begun to conceive a distaste for the\r\nReformers of Upper Canada. There seemed to be a natural antagonism\r\nbetween him and them. The reason is not far to seek. Persons of the\r\nsocial grade of Mackenzie were inconceivably odious to this \"diner-out\r\nof the first water;\" while men like Bidwell and Baldwin made him\r\npainfully conscious of his own littleness and insufficiency for the task\r\nwhich he had undertaken. Yet he could not venture to call to his Council\r\nany of the remnant of the Tory Compact, and thereby utterly ignore the\r\nLiberal principles which were presumed to have dictated his appointment.\r\nThe Tories, moreover, had seen fit to petition the King against his very\r\nfirst administrative act--the appointment of a Surveyor-General. As for\r\nthe Conservatives, as distinct from the Tories, they had not yet\r\nformulated a distinct policy, and none of their leaders had come very\r\nconspicuously to the front.\r\n\r\nIt seemed clear, then, that the choice must be made from the Reform\r\nranks. After much deliberation and inquiry,[222] the Lieutenant-Governor\r\ncame to the conclusion that approaches should be made to Robert Baldwin,\r\na gentleman to whom he refers as \"highly respected for his moral\r\ncharacter, being moderate in his politics, and possessing the esteem and\r\nconfidence of all parties.\"[223] His Excellency's resolve on this\r\nsubject was approved of by the Speakers of the two Houses, as well as\r\nby the three members of the Council, to all of whom the project was\r\nsubmitted before any attempt was made to carry it out. When the proposal\r\nwas made to Mr. Baldwin it was received by him with becoming respect,\r\nbut with a coolness of demeanour which was far from flattering to the\r\nvanity of Sir Francis, who seems to have expected that the recipient\r\nwould be well-nigh overwhelmed by the honour. The latter stated that he\r\nwas very reluctant to again embark in public life, and he explained his\r\nviews on the political situation with great frankness. There were\r\nseveral interviews, in the course of which Sir Francis did his utmost to\r\ninduce Mr. Baldwin to accede to his wishes. Mr. Baldwin required time\r\nfor consideration, an indulgence which was of course accorded. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor being anxious to carry his point, sent for Mr.\r\nBaldwin's father, Dr. W. W. Baldwin, for the purpose of securing his\r\ninfluence in the negotiations. Father and son were both of one mind.\r\nThere was little or nothing in common between the political sentiments\r\nof the three members of the existing Executive Council and the man whom\r\nit was proposed to add to their number. How, then, could it be expected\r\nthat they would agree as to the policy of the Administration. If they\r\ndid not agree, what would Mr. Baldwin's single voice avail against the\r\nother three? And, even admitting that this anomaly could be got rid of,\r\nit was deemed necessary that there should be some understanding on the\r\nsubject of Executive responsibility before Mr. Baldwin could consent to\r\naccept a seat in the Council. He and his father, from whom his political\r\nideas had been chiefly derived, had for years contended that Responsible\r\nGovernment already existed in Upper Canada by virtue of the\r\nConstitutional Act, and that when a Government failed to command a\r\nmajority of votes in the Assembly it was legally bound to resign. It was\r\nof course notorious that this principle had never been recognized by the\r\nProvincial Administration, but Mr. Baldwin was of opinion that the\r\nconstitution had been systematically violated in this particular. In\r\ntalking over the matter with the Lieutenant-Governor he now discovered\r\nthat the latter was entirely unacquainted with constitutional questions,\r\nand that he had no ideas on the subject whatever, beyond such as he had\r\npicked up within the past few days. Still, his Excellency's good temper,\r\nand his seeming anxiety to do his duty, won upon the sympathies of Mr.\r\nBaldwin, who naturally felt desirous to be of service to a man who had\r\ncome to Canada in the guise of a tried Reformer, and who professed to be\r\nactuated by a sincere desire to govern the colony on Liberal principles.\r\nAfter several courteous refusals, and after much consideration and\r\nrepeated consultations with his friends, Mr. Baldwin consented to accept\r\noffice, provided that seats in the Council were at the same time offered\r\nto his father, and to Dr. Rolph and Mr. Bidwell. Dr. Baldwin was so\r\nunwilling to accept the cares of office that his name was dropped by\r\ncommon consent. To Dr. Rolph no objection was felt, but his Excellency\r\nhad conceived an antagonism towards Mr. Bidwell, with whom he had had\r\nfrequent interviews, and who had not scrupled to express himself with\r\nmuch freedom on the necessity for a regular system of Provincial Reform.\r\nAfter considerable discussion, it was agreed that John Henry Dunn, the\r\nProvincial Receiver-General, should be substituted for Mr. Bidwell. Mr.\r\nDunn was not a member of any political party, nor had he any special\r\naptitude for political life; but he was a man of high character and\r\nmoderate views, and was held in much public estimation. On Saturday the\r\n20th of February the three new Councillors were sworn into office and\r\ngazetted, \"until the King's pleasure be known.\"[224] The three old\r\nmembers retained their places.\r\n\r\nThis manifestation of a resolve to carry on the Government of the\r\nProvince by means of Councillors possessing the public confidence was\r\nhailed with great favour by the Reform party, and indeed by the\r\nConservatives as well, for Messieurs Baldwin, Rolph and Dunn were\r\npersons for whom the highest respect was felt by all classes of the\r\ncommunity, and were regarded as being altogether above suspicion. Even\r\nthe members of the Compact were disposed to favour the arrangement, for,\r\nin consequence of rumours which had reached their ears, they had dreaded\r\nthat the Lieutenant-Governor might possibly ally himself with the\r\nRadicals, who, if placed in power, would have done their utmost to exact\r\na reckoning for past abuses. Upon the whole, then, Sir Francis had\r\nmaterially strengthened his position. But the strength was fictitious\r\nrather than real, and the baseless fabric which he had reared with such\r\npains quickly tottered and fell. The three new Councillors were not long\r\nin discovering that their places were sinecures. His Excellency wanted\r\nnone of their counsel, and had no intention of permitting them to have\r\nany real voice in the carrying-on of the Government. To one person only\r\ndid he apply for advice in every emergency. That person was not a member\r\nof the Government, and was therefore an unsworn counsellor, under no\r\nsemblance of responsibility to anybody. He was a power behind the\r\nthrone, with all the privileges and none of the disabilities attaching\r\nto such a position. The gentleman elevated to this anomalous dignity was\r\nChief Justice Robinson, Speaker of the Legislative Council, the\r\nmaster-spirit of the Family Compact, and the life-long champion of those\r\nvery abuses which the \"Tried Reformer\" was currently supposed to have\r\nbeen sent out to remove. The Councillors, old as well as new, were\r\ntreated as mere figure-heads. They were consulted about land matters and\r\ninsignificant questions of detail, but the policy and measures of the\r\nGovernment seldom passed under their review, or were submitted to them\r\nfor advice.[225] Some of these measures were such as they could not\r\napprove or sanction. His Excellency nominated two adherents of the old\r\nofficial party to vacant offices upon which they had no sort of claim.\r\nHe refused the royal assent to the Felons' Counsel Bill, a measure\r\n\"demanded by justice and humanity, and passed for more than ten years,\r\nalmost unanimously, by repeated and different Houses of Assembly.\"[226]\r\nThe Councillors were thus made to seem responsible for acts over which\r\nthey had no control, and of which some of them, at least, highly\r\ndisapproved. The Reform party were astonished to see such things done\r\nunder the auspices of a Government of which Robert Baldwin and Dr. Rolph\r\nwere members. They however acquitted both those gentleman of having\r\nadvised such acts. It was believed by Reformers generally that the three\r\nnew Councillors were not consulted, or else that the old members, with\r\nthe umpirage of the Lieutenant-Governor, predominated.[227]\r\n\r\nThis state of things could not be allowed to continue. The Executive\r\nCouncillors consulted together, and determined upon a remonstrance with\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor. This remonstrance was formally prepared in\r\nwriting, and sent in to his Excellency on Friday, the 4th of March. The\r\nthree old members concurred in it, and it was signed by all the six in\r\norder of seniority. The mere fact of this concurrence affords strong\r\nevidence of the growth of the power of public opinion in the Province.\r\nIn past times members of the Executive Council had been content to pose\r\nas figure-heads year after year, while John Beverley Robinson and one or\r\ntwo others manipulated and directed the whole course of public affairs.\r\nIt is probable, however, that in the present instance the three senior\r\nCouncillors may have been influenced by the arguments of Baldwin and\r\nRolph, who felt very strongly on the question at issue.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor's reply, every paragraph of which bears evidence\r\nof the Chief Justice's cunning hand, is dated on the following day, but\r\nwas not actually communicated until the next regular Council day, which\r\nwas Thursday, the 10th. It contained a firm but courteous expression of\r\nhis Excellency's dissent from the opinions expressed by the Executive\r\nCouncillors as to their privileges and duties. It was contended that the\r\nLieutenant-Governor was the sole responsible minister, and the\r\ndifference between the constitution of the mother-country and the colony\r\nwas referred to as being highly advantageous to the latter. His\r\nExcellency, it was said, was only bound to consult his Council when he\r\nfelt the need of their advice, and to do so on the innumerable subjects\r\nupon which he was daily compelled to decide would be \"as utterly\r\nimpossible as for any one but himself to decide upon what points his\r\nmind required or needed\" advice. The position taken by the Councillors\r\nwas declared to be unconstitutional, but his Excellency informed them\r\nthat his estimation of their talents and integrity, as well as his\r\npersonal regard for them, remained unshaken, and that he was not\r\ninsensible to the difficulties to which he would be exposed should they\r\ndeem it necessary to resign. He added, however, that should they be of\r\nopinion that their oaths required them to retire from office, he begged\r\nthat they would not on his account hesitate to do so. As they were very\r\nstrongly of that opinion, they waited on his Excellency on Saturday, the\r\n12th, and tendered their resignations, which were accepted. They had\r\nheld office precisely three weeks.\r\n\r\nThe clue to this puzzle is easily found. Sir Francis had conceived an\r\nutter distaste for the persons and political principles of the Reformers\r\nof Upper Canada. There was an inherent antagonism between the nature of\r\nthis shallow, feather-brained sketcher by the wayside and the natures of\r\nmen like Rolph, Bidwell and the Baldwins, whose quiet earnestness and\r\nfixity of purpose had been intensified by the long course of injustice\r\nto which they, in common with their party, had been subjected. The\r\nearnestness of these gentlemen presented itself to him in the light of\r\nimportunity, if not of impertinence. He could hardly be expected to\r\nsympathize very strongly with their unconquerable zeal for principles\r\nwhich he did not understand: which he was perhaps incapable of\r\nunderstanding. Then, Sir Francis was an eminently social personage, and\r\nthe social qualities of the leaders of Upper Canadian Reform were not of\r\na high order. To them, small talk across the walnuts and the wine seemed\r\nutterly incongruous in view of the momentous public questions which were\r\nurgently pressing for a solution. In this particular they presented a\r\nmarked contrast to the leading spirits of the Compact. The Robinsons,\r\nHagermans and Sherwoods, one and all, could not only advise the\r\nLieutenant-Governor on the affairs of the Province, but could be\r\npleasant and entertaining companions. They were not very different from\r\nthe county magistrates and other officials with whom he had been\r\naccustomed to confer in his capacity of a poor-law commissioner. They\r\nwere moreover exceedingly diplomatic. They saw the importance of winning\r\nhim to their side, and governed themselves accordingly. They lost no\r\nopportunity of making themselves agreeable to him. Instead of boring him\r\nwith what, to his understanding, seemed abstruse speculations on\r\nexecutive responsibility and an elective Legislative Council, they\r\nscouted such doctrines as myths begotten in the moody brains of\r\nunpractical and discontented men. The wide knowledge, long experience\r\nand specious eloquence of the Chief Justice enabled him to present the\r\nTory side of these arguments with much plausibility. Sir Francis soon\r\nbecame convinced that the issue was not merely between two sides of\r\ncolonial politics, but between monarchy and republicanism, between\r\nloyalty and disloyalty, between Great Britain and the United States. As\r\nhe afterwards declared, he believed that he was \"sentenced to contend on\r\nthe soil of America with Democracy,[228]\" and that if he did not\r\noverpower it, he would himself be compelled to succumb. Having brought\r\nhimself to this conclusion, he not unnaturally preferred the _role_ of\r\nthe hammer to that of the anvil. It was surely better to strike than to\r\nbe struck. Acting on this principle, he made a complete surrender of\r\nhimself to the Family Compact, and from that time forward was in all\r\nessential respects guided by their counsels. His rashness and\r\nimpetuosity sometimes led him to act on his own motion, and without\r\nwaiting to take counsel from any quarter; but in all ordinary affairs of\r\nadministration he was guided by Sir John Robinson quite as effectually\r\nas Sir John Colborne had ever been.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was it announced that the Executive Councillors had all\r\nresigned office than the public pulse began to beat at an accelerated\r\npace. The excitement was greatly intensified upon the publication of a\r\nletter written by Robert Baldwin to Peter Perry, in which, by the\r\nLieutenant-Governor's special permission, all the attendant\r\ncircumstances were set forth in detail. This letter, having been written\r\nfor the express purpose of being read by Mr. Perry from his place in the\r\nAssembly, and of being afterwards published in the newspapers, is\r\nsomewhat formal and official in its tone, but it presents the\r\nsubject-matter in a clear light, and must be regarded as an important\r\ncontribution to the history of Responsible Government in Upper Canada.\r\nIt is the chief, indeed the only trustworthy original authority for the\r\nfacts as to the precise dispute between Sir Francis and his Council, for\r\nthe former's account[229] is more than usually incomplete and one-sided\r\nwhen dealing with this episode. The essential portions of Mr. Baldwin's\r\npresentation of the case have been embodied in the foregoing narrative.\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor lost no time in providing himself with a new\r\nCouncil. On the 14th of March, when the resignation was only two days\r\nold, an extraordinary issue of the _Gazette_ announced that Robert\r\nBaldwin Sullivan, John Elmsley, Augustus Baldwin and William Allan had\r\nbeen appointed members of the Executive Council of the Province. The\r\nreader has already made the acquaintance of all these gentlemen with the\r\nexception of Augustus Baldwin, who was a retired naval officer of high\r\ncharacter, but of no particular politics; a brother of Dr. Baldwin, and\r\nby consequence an uncle of Robert Baldwin. All four of the new\r\nCouncillors were persons of character and position, but they were not in\r\nsympathy with the Liberal sentiments of the period, and the people\r\ngenerally were not disposed to place any political confidence in them.\r\nElmsley and Allan were consistent, old-fashioned Tories. Baldwin's\r\nleanings, so far as he had any, were in the same direction. Sullivan's\r\nyouth and early life had been passed amid more or less Liberal\r\ninfluences, but of late he had shown a retrogressive tendency in\r\npolitical matters. This was largely due to personal rivalry between\r\nMackenzie and himself in municipal affairs. As previously mentioned, he\r\nhad defeated Mackenzie at the municipal elections for St. David's Ward,\r\nand had been elected mayor of Toronto in the beginning of 1835. The\r\ncontest had been waged between them with unseemly rancour. Sullivan had\r\ndenounced Mackenzie as a noisy upstart and demagogue; while Mackenzie\r\nhad characterized Sullivan as an oily-tongued, unprincipled lawyer, who\r\nwould lie the loudest for the client who had the longest purse. All\r\nMackenzie's supporters during the contest had been Radicals, or at least\r\npersons of strong Reform proclivities. This had arrayed the whole Tory\r\nand Conservative vote on the side of Sullivan, who was thus in a measure\r\nbrought under anti-Reform influences. His social tastes also inclined\r\nhim in the same direction, so that he soon came to be classed as a\r\nConservative. Reformers were disposed to look askance at him as a\r\npolitical renegade, and this disposition was increased upon his\r\nacceptance of office under Sir Francis Head at the present juncture. He\r\nalone, of all the new Councillors, was a man of exceptional ability. He\r\nwas not inaccurately described, a few years later, as \"an Irishman by\r\nbirth, and a lawyer by profession; a man who, if he had united\r\nconsistency of political conduct and weight of personal character with\r\nthe great and original talents which he unquestionably possessed, might\r\nhave taken a conspicuous part in the public affairs of any\r\ncountry.\"[230]\r\n\r\nThese transactions--the resignation of the Councillors and the\r\nappointment of their successors--produced a tremendous effervescence of\r\nfeeling among the Opposition in the Assembly, who had already conceived\r\nstrong suspicions of the Lieutenant-Governor's motives. But the\r\nexcitement was not confined to the Opposition. It was participated in by\r\nthe Conservatives, and, even, for a time, by most of the ultra-Tories.\r\nOn the 14th of March, the House, by a vote of fifty-three to two,\r\nadopted a resolution unequivocally assertive of the principles which the\r\nex-Councillors had endeavoured to maintain. Ten days later an address to\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, based on this resolution, was passed by a vote\r\nof thirty-two to nineteen. It expressed deep regret that his Excellency\r\nhad consented to accept the resignation of his late Council. It declared\r\nthe Assembly's entire want of confidence in the new appointments, and\r\nhumbly requested that immediate steps might be taken to remove the new\r\nCouncillors from office. Meanwhile, petitions on the all-engrossing\r\nsubject poured into the Assembly from all over the Province.[231] Public\r\nmeetings were called in Toronto, as well as in some other of the\r\nprincipal towns, at which resolutions were passed echoing the Assembly's\r\naddress, imploring the Lieutenant-Governor to dismiss his present\r\nadvisers, and to call to his Council gentlemen possessing public\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nOne of these gatherings tended in an especial manner to widen the\r\nirreparable breach between Sir Francis Head and the Reform party. On the\r\n25th of March a meeting was held in the City Hall, Toronto, at which an\r\nAddress to his Excellency of exceptional significance was passed. It\r\ndealt at considerable length with the constitutional question at issue;\r\nreferred to Responsible Government as having been introduced by the\r\nConstitutional Act; expressed surprise and sorrow at the resignation of\r\nthe late Councillors, and an entire want of confidence in their\r\nsuccessors. It deplored the apparent fact that his Excellency was acting\r\nunder the influence of evil and unknown advisers. In conclusion, it\r\nclaimed all the rights and privileges of the British constitution, and\r\nthat the representative of the Crown should be advised by men known to\r\nand possessing the confidence of the people. When the deputation called\r\nat Government House to present this Address, they were treated with an\r\noff-hand abruptness and _brusquerie_ which gave them much offence. The\r\nreply of his Excellency was wordy and unsatisfying in tone; but its most\r\nobjectionable feature was the air of assumed superiority by which it was\r\npervaded. It referred to the meeting represented by the deputation as\r\nhaving been composed principally of \"the industrious classes,\" but\r\nadded, with a seeming loftiness of condescension, that the Address\r\nshould be replied to with as much attention as if it had proceeded from\r\neither of the branches of the Legislature--\"although,\" said his\r\nExcellency, \"I shall express myself in plainer and more homely\r\nlanguage.\" This was bad enough, but its effect was intensified by the\r\ndemeanour of the Lieutenant-Governor and several military officers who\r\nwere in attendance upon him. It seemed to the deputation that those\r\ngentlemen regarded them with supercilious impertinence; as a something\r\nwhich viceroyalty must be content, for the nonce, to endure, but as\r\nbeing altogether beyond the pale of their sympathies or interests.\r\nNothing could have been in worse taste than such conduct as this, though\r\nit is possible enough that more sensitiveness was displayed than was\r\ncalled for by the actual circumstances. The deputation withdrew, cut to\r\nthe quick by the indignities which they, rightly or wrongly, conceived\r\nthemselves to have sustained. On the succeeding evening a meeting of\r\nthemselves and some of their friends was held at the house of Dr.\r\nMorrison--who was now mayor of the city--at which a bitterly sarcastic\r\nrejoinder was prepared. It thanked his Excellency for replying to an\r\nAddress from \"the industrious classes\" with as much attention as if it\r\nhad proceeded from either branch of the Legislature, and acknowledged\r\nhis condescension in expressing himself in plain and homely\r\nlanguage--language presumed to be brought down to the level of the plain\r\nand homely understandings of his interlocutors, whose deplorable want of\r\neducation was accounted for by the maladministration by former\r\nGovernments of the endowments of King's College, and by the\r\nimpossibility of obtaining a sale of the Clergy Reserves and the\r\nappropriation of the proceeds to educational purposes. \"It is,\"\r\nproceeded this cutting rejoinder, \"because we have been thus maltreated,\r\nneglected and despised, in our education and interests, under the system\r\nof Government that has hitherto prevailed, that we are now driven to\r\ninsist upon a change that cannot be for the worse.\" Reference was made\r\nto the desire to bring about a system of Responsible Government, and the\r\nutter futility of mere responsibility to Downing Street was pointed out\r\nwith a pointed eloquence which proved that the signatories were in\r\ndeadly earnest. The misgovernment of Dalhousie and Aylmer in Lower\r\nCanada, and of Gore, Maitland and Colborne in Upper Canada, was touched\r\nupon in a few brief, vitriolic sentences. It was shown that, though\r\nthese gentlemen had been responsible to Downing Street, they had not\r\nonly met with no punishment, but had actually been promoted to higher\r\nhonours. \"We do not mean,\" said they, \"in our plain and homely\r\nstatement, to be discourteous, by declaring our unalterable conviction\r\nthat a nominal responsibility to Downing Street, which has failed of any\r\ngood with the above gentlemen of high pretensions to honour, character\r\nand station, cannot have any magic operation in your Excellency's\r\nadministration, which, should it end as it has unhappily begun, might\r\nmake us drink the cup of national misgovernment to the very dregs,\r\nwithout (as experience proves) redress on our part, or retribution on\r\nyours.\" There was much more of the same sort. The document concluded by\r\nstating that if the Lieutenant-Governor would not govern upon sound\r\nconstitutional principles he would violate the charter, virtually\r\nabrogate the law, and justly forfeit submission to his authority.\r\n\r\nThis was beyond doubt the most vigorously-written protest that had ever\r\nbeen presented to an Upper Canadian Lieutenant-Governor. It was signed\r\nby Jesse Ketchum, James Hervey Price, James Lesslie, Andrew McGlashan,\r\nJames Shannon, Robert McKay, M. McLellan, Timothy Parsons, William\r\nLesslie, John Mills, E. T. Henderson, John Doel, John E. Tims, and\r\nWilliam J. O'Grady. All these were ardent Radicals, and coadjutors of\r\nMackenzie. Two of them--Jesse Ketchum and James Lesslie--delivered the\r\nrejoinder at Government House, without waiting for a reply. It was\r\nalready in type, and during the next day was widely read and commented\r\nupon. The Lieutenant-Governor was not insensible to its cutting irony,\r\nbut it did not admit of any sur-rejoinder, and after the first transient\r\nebullition of his wrath, the matter, so far as he was concerned, was\r\nquietly permitted to drop out of sight. The document, however, acted as\r\nan additional stimulus to the public excitement, and it continued to be\r\nquoted against Sir Francis from time to time so long as he remained in\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were occurring the Provincial Legislature still\r\nremained in session. A Committee having been appointed by the Assembly\r\nto consider the correspondence between the Lieutenant-Governor and the\r\nex-Councillors, it proceeded to deal with the question in the usual\r\nmanner. The report was presented to the Assembly on the 18th of April.\r\nIn the course of the debate which ensued, several eloquent speeches were\r\nmade on the Tory side. The most effective Tory arguments were founded\r\nupon the assumption that the concession of Responsible Government would\r\nbe a mere preliminary to separation from the mother country. The speech\r\nmade by Mr. Hagerman on this occasion was one of the most brilliant\r\nefforts of his life. Mere verbal eloquence, however, exhausted itself in\r\nvain. The report was adopted by a vote of thirty-two to twenty-one. It\r\nwas even more directly condemnatory of the Lieutenant-Governor than the\r\nrejoinder above referred to had been. It expressed the Committee's\r\nbelief that the appointment of the three ex-Councillors had been a\r\ndeceitful manoeuvre to gain credit with the country for Liberal\r\nfeelings and intentions where none really existed. The question of\r\nExecutive responsibility was gone into at considerable length, and the\r\nconduct of the ex-Councillors was approved of in every particular. There\r\nis no need to analyze the entire report, which was long and exhaustive.\r\nIt distinctly recommended the withholding of the annual supplies. The\r\nAssembly, by adopting the report, and by committing itself to this\r\nextreme measure, proved that, in the language of Lord Glenelg's\r\ninstructions,[232] it regarded the present in the light of \"an\r\nemergency.\" The supplies, however, were not entirely withheld. Money\r\nwas granted for the construction of roads, for schools, for the\r\nimprovement of navigation, and other useful purposes; but all these\r\ngrants were nullified by the Lieutenant-Governor, who signified his\r\ndisapprobation of the Assembly's conduct by refusing his assent to the\r\nmoney-bills of the session. He afterwards stated as one of his reasons\r\nfor this refusal that he had good grounds for believing a portion of the\r\nmoney would have been spent by the Assembly in sending an agent to\r\nEngland[233]--which was probably the fact.\r\n\r\nThe Assembly, feeling that some reason should be assigned for their\r\naction in the matter of the supplies, which were now withheld for the\r\nfirst time in the history of Upper Canada, passed an Address to the\r\nKing, in which the Lieutenant-Governor's conduct was painted in no\r\nneutral tints. He was directly charged with being despotic, tyrannical,\r\nunjust and deceitful. His conduct was declared to have been \"derogatory\r\nto the honour\" of his Majesty, and \"demoralizing to the community.\" A\r\nmemorial to the House of Commons was also adopted, in which his public\r\nacts were referred to as having been arbitrary and vindictive, and\r\nwherein he was charged with mis-statements, misrepresentations, and\r\n\"deviations from candour and truth.\" This bitterly-worded memorial was\r\nformally signed by Mr. Bidwell as Speaker of the House--a circumstance\r\nwhich was long remembered against him by the person implicated.\r\n\r\nIt must have been gall and wormwood to Sir Francis to be compelled to\r\nforward these documents to the Colonial Office. It was the first time\r\nthat clear and undisguised charges of so humiliating a nature had been\r\nofficially laid against a colonial Lieutenant-Governor, and one must\r\nneeds confess that nothing short of the most unassailable evidence could\r\nhave justified the employment of such terms in a communication between\r\ntwo representative bodies respecting a trusted servant of the Crown,\r\nmore especially in the case of one occupying so lofty a position.\r\nSomething is due to the proprieties, and to accuse a man of deviations\r\nfrom candour and truth is of course merely a slightly periphrastic\r\nmethod of charging him with falsehood. The Assembly, however, had become\r\nconvinced, not without reason, that Sir Francis's word was not to be\r\ntrusted. Other persons who had been brought into more or less intimate\r\nrelations with him had been driven to the same conclusion.[234] The fact\r\nis that when his feelings were much stirred he knew not how to speak the\r\nlanguage of truth and soberness. He talked so much and so thoughtlessly\r\nthat he very frequently gave utterance to the thing which was not. Some\r\nexcuse might perhaps be made for one who, in the heat or haste of verbal\r\ncontroversy, gives currency to erroneous statements. But Sir Francis's\r\nmis-statements were not confined to verbal controversy. He had been\r\ndistinctly convicted of \"a deviation from candour and truth\" in a\r\ndeliberate official communication. The Assembly had requested that they\r\nmight be furnished with copies of any bond or agreement between him and\r\nhis Councillors respecting the administration of the Government in the\r\nevent of his Excellency's death or removal. To this request Sir Francis\r\nhad replied, explicitly denying the existence of any document of such a\r\nnature. Yet upon the examination of certain of the Councillors it had\r\nbeen proved that an agreement on the subject had actually been made, and\r\nthat it had been reduced to writing by his Excellency's own hand. The\r\ndevices to which he had had recourse in his attempts to prove that he\r\nhad merely been guilty of tergiversation instead of downright lying,\r\nwere such as positively to aggravate the original offence, and to fully\r\njustify the Assembly in refusing to attach any weight to his unsupported\r\nstatement upon any subject.[235] As the weeks passed by, the quarrel\r\nbetween him and the Assembly waxed positively ferocious. On the 20th of\r\nApril he prorogued Parliament, making a speech on the occasion which\r\nmust have occupied a full hour or more in delivery, and wherein he\r\nreviewed, in his own inimitable fashion, and from his own point of view,\r\nthe various events by which his Administration had up to this time been\r\ncharacterized. Any attempt to analyze it here is altogether out of the\r\nquestion. It should be read in its entirety in the official Journal of\r\nthe session.\r\n\r\nDuring the weeks following the prorogation the public excitement\r\ncontinued to increase, until it had reached a height without precedent\r\nin the history of the Province. The Reformers felt that they had been\r\nwofully deceived in the Lieutenant-Governor, and many of them placed no\r\nbounds to their censure. Some of the Reform newspapers hinted pretty\r\nstrongly that no people could be expected to remain permanently loyal\r\nwhen they were deprived of their rights year after year, and when all\r\ntheir petitions were set at naught. The political atmosphere was charged\r\nwith electricity. The outlook was lurid and ominous. Some of the\r\nloyalists began to dread an actual uprising of the people. Such an\r\nuprising, they thought, would be a legitimate sequel to so extraordinary\r\na proceeding as the stoppage of the supplies. To not a few well-meaning\r\nbut old-fashioned people the mere act of refusing to vote the supplies\r\nwas in itself a species of treason. To more practical people this act\r\npresented itself in a different aspect. It seemed to them indicative of\r\na niggard and ruinous parsimony. They gazed with ill-concealed envy at\r\nthe marvellous prosperity of the neighbouring State of New York. Any one\r\ncrossing the Canadian frontier in that direction at once became aware\r\nthat he had passed from a land of comparative stagnation to a land of\r\nactivity and progress. This contrast had been largely brought about by\r\nthe construction of great public works, and a lavish policy on the part\r\nof the State Legislature. There seemed no reason to doubt that the\r\nadoption of a similar policy would bring about similar results in Upper\r\nCanada, where large and costly public works were urgently needed for the\r\nproper development of the resources of the colony. But, instead of\r\nliberal grants of money for such purposes, the Assembly had cut down the\r\nsupplies to meet the barest works of necessity. The colony could never\r\nhope to hold up its head by the side of its enterprising neighbour while\r\nsuch a cheese-paring system prevailed.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor's advisers were shrewd enough to make the most\r\nof this unpromising state of affairs. The cheese-paring policy went for\r\nsomething, but it was almost lost sight of in the much more effective\r\nimputation of disloyalty to the Empire. Nothing was so certain to turn\r\nthe scale of public opinion in favour of his Excellency as an apparently\r\nwell-founded stigma of disloyalty cast upon his opponents. The official\r\nparty accordingly set themselves deliberately to work to disseminate the\r\nbelief that the bulk of the Opposition were ripe for treason, and that,\r\nunder the guise of agitation for Reform, they concealed a design of\r\neffecting the separation of the colony from Great Britain. It is not\r\nimprobable that many of those who industriously circulated the report\r\ndid so in good faith, for the language of some of the Reformers, used in\r\nmoments of irritation, was of a nature to lead to such a conclusion. No\r\nsooner did this report gain credence than there was a very perceptible\r\nturning of the scale of popular opinion. Many who had grumbled loudly at\r\nSir Francis's conduct now declared themselves as being on his side. They\r\nfavoured the doctrine of a responsible Executive, but devotion to the\r\nmother country was as the breath of their nostrils. Whatever tended to\r\nrelax the tie which bound the colony to the Empire was a thing to be\r\nutterly opposed and stamped out. The domination of the Compact was bad,\r\nbut even at its worst it was better than separation. So argued many\r\npersons who had always been conspicuous for the moderation of their\r\npolitical views. The official party of course turned such sentiments as\r\nthese to the utmost account. The cry of disloyalty was heard on every\r\nside. The state of the Lower Province, which was rapidly gliding into\r\ninsurrection, was triumphantly pointed to as evidence of what was to be\r\nlooked for if democratic ideas were allowed to make headway. Twice\r\nwithin the last four years had the Lower Canadian Assembly resorted to\r\nthe extreme measure of refusing to grant supplies to the Government. By\r\nso doing they had embroiled themselves with the Imperial Ministry, and\r\ndrawn down upon themselves the indignation of persons of moderate views.\r\nIt was no secret that the Upper Canadian Reformers generally were in\r\nsympathy with the projects of Reform entertained by the Lower Canadian\r\nagitators; and it suited the Tories to assume that the sympathy extended\r\nnot only to legitimate projects of Reform, but to less openly-avowed\r\nschemes of rebellion. Just before the prorogation Mr. Bidwell had laid\r\nbefore the Assembly a letter written by Louis Joseph Papineau, Speaker\r\nof the Lower Canada Assembly, wherein the great agitator had given\r\nutterance to sentiments which, read in the light of subsequent events,\r\ncannot be construed otherwise than as treasonable. Several members of\r\nthe Reform party had publicly spoken enthusiastically of M. Papineau,\r\nand had even gone so far as to express approbation of his most\r\nindiscreet and objectionable language. This circumstance was now urged\r\nto show that the objects of the anti-Executive party in both Provinces\r\nwere identical. There was no attempt to discriminate between\r\nconstitutional Reformers of the Baldwin stamp and advanced Radicals like\r\nMackenzie. All were included in one sweeping verdict as \"disloyal\"\r\npersons, against whom it was necessary for right-minded citizens to\r\norganize in self-defence.\r\n\r\nEarly in May these sentiments began to find expression in outward acts.\r\nA number of Tory gentlemen of Toronto formed themselves into what they\r\ncalled the British Constitutional Society, with the fundamental\r\nprinciple and object of perpetuating the connection between Upper Canada\r\nand the United Kingdom. A society bearing the same name had been formed\r\nupon the breaking out of the War of 1812, and this of 1836 professed to\r\nbe a reorganization of the former one. In reality, however, it was to\r\nall intents and purposes a new society, started for the specific purpose\r\nof opposing the cry for Responsible Government, and of gaining support\r\nfor Sir Francis Head. During the previous year, Colonel Fitzgibbon had,\r\nunder Sir John Colborne's auspices, formed a drill corps for such young\r\nmen of Toronto as desired military instruction. A handful of\r\nwell-connected young men had availed themselves of the opportunity. The\r\nColonel now devoted himself with redoubled ardour to preparations for\r\nthe insurrection which he declared would burst forth before the next\r\nwinter. He got together a rifle corps to the number of seventy, and\r\ndrilled them twice a week with tireless enthusiasm, declaring that when\r\nthe hour of trial should come, he and \"his boys\" would be found in their\r\nplaces, however the rest of the community might see fit to demean\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these preparations, and the prevailing sentiments which\r\ninspired them, it is doubtful whether the idea of rebellion had up to\r\nthis time taken definite possession of the mind of a single human being\r\nin Upper Canada. There seems abundant reason for believing that the time\r\nfor wise concession was not past, and that a prudent and discreet\r\nAdministrator might have restored tranquillity to the land without\r\ngoing an iota beyond the scope of Lord Glenelg's instructions. But Sir\r\nFrancis Head acted in no such spirit. He set his mind firmly against\r\nconcession, feeling convinced, as he said, that the more he yielded the\r\nmore would be demanded of him. In this respect he--no doubt\r\nunconsciously--emulated the example of James the Second, who was of\r\nopinion that his father owed the loss of his head to his concessions to\r\nthe House of Commons. That this opinion was altogether erroneous does\r\nnot admit of argument. Sir Francis was equally wrong, and equally\r\nstubborn in maintaining his opinion. His conduct was the last straw\r\nheaped upon the back of the much-enduring camel, and the outbreak which\r\nfollowed must in large measure be attributed to his misgovernment.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[210] See the letter, in Head's _Narrative_, chap. iii.\r\n\r\n[211] This proceeding was not relished by the Assembly. Sir John\r\nColborne had already delivered one Speech from the Throne at the opening\r\nof the session, and this delivery of a second one was resented as a\r\nbreach of privilege. After much time had been wasted in discussion, a\r\nprecedent for the Lieutenant-Governor's action was found under date of\r\nDecember, 1765, and this matter was allowed to drop.\r\n\r\n[212] In the third chapter of his _Narrative_ Sir Francis attempts to\r\nexcuse himself for this senseless act.

This step\r\nwas the dissolution of the existing Parliament. He and his advisers,\r\nsworn and unsworn, believed that the time was opportune for a general\r\nelection. If the numerical majority of the Opposition in the Assembly\r\nwere reversed, the Government could afford to laugh at what they called\r\n\"low-bred democracy.\" Such a reversal, it was thought, might now be\r\neffected. The disloyalty cry might safely be trusted to do its work, not\r\nonly by clearing the Assembly of the chief members of the Opposition,\r\nbut by giving the Government party an easy working majority. In order,\r\nhowever, that his Excellency might seem to be following public opinion\r\nin this matter instead of guiding it, the official party caused\r\npetitions to be sent in from various quarters, praying that a\r\ndissolution and a general election might take place. This not only\r\nserved the intended purpose of misleading the public as to the designs\r\nof the Executive, but also afforded Sir Francis an opportunity of\r\npouring out oceans of words in the form of replies. The concluding\r\nsentence of his reply to an address from certain electors of the Home\r\nDistrict is eminently characteristic of the man. Portions of the\r\nalready-mentioned letter from Papineau to Bidwell had seemed to point to\r\na possible invasion of the Province by inhabitants of the United States.\r\nThis idea was eagerly seized upon by Sir Francis, as indicative of\r\nconcerted action between the hypothetical invaders and the Upper\r\nCanadian Radicals. \"In the name of every regiment of militia in Upper\r\nCanada,\" said he--\"_Let them come if they dare!_\"[236] Nothing but\r\nactual perusal of his despatches will afford any accurate idea of his\r\nblatant self-confidence at this time. It is quite evident that he\r\nregarded the above-quoted reply as a master-stroke of vigorous\r\ndiplomacy. He drew special attention to it in a communication to Lord\r\nGlenelg, in the course of which he made use of language which must have\r\nalmost stunned the conventional and decorous Colonial Secretary. \"I am\r\naware,\" he wrote, \"that the answer may be cavilled at in Downing Street,\r\nfor I know it is not exactly according to Hoyle. _Mais, man seigneur,\r\ncroyez-vous done qu'on fasse des revolutions avec de l'eau de\r\nrose?_\"[237] The tone of his despatches is from first to last\r\nextraordinary. It would seem as if they ought to have told their own\r\nmiserable tale of superficiality and unfitness to the Colonial\r\nSecretary. In announcing the probability of an early dissolution of the\r\nProvincial Parliament, Sir Francis requests his Lordship to send him no\r\norders on the subject, but to allow him to work the matter in his own\r\nway.[238] The Opposition are constantly referred to in such phrases as\r\n\"the republicans in the House of Assembly,\" and \"the revolutionists of\r\nUpper Canada.\"[239] His Lordship is warned that if the demands of the\r\nOpposition be complied with in the matter of Executive responsibility,\r\n\"democracy, in the worst possible form, will prevail in our\r\ncolonies.\"[240] \"In South America,\" he remarks, \"truth and justice\r\ncarried me through difficulties even greater than those I have now to\r\ncontend with, and I have the firmest reliance they will again be\r\ntriumphant.\"[241] In another despatch[242] his Lordship is notified that\r\nRobert Baldwin, who is referred to as an agent of \"the revolutionary\r\nparty,\" is about to start for London. \"It is stated,\" writes Sir\r\nFrancis, \"that he goes there for the recovery of his health, but it is\r\nacknowledged by his party that he will be prepared to answer any\r\nquestions which the Government may feel disposed to put to him.\" This\r\nintimation is followed by the expression of a confidence that his\r\nLordship will discountenance \"the system of sending agents from the\r\nBritish North American colonies, and their being received by the\r\nGovernment.\" A hope is expressed that should Mr. Baldwin directly or\r\nindirectly communicate with the Colonial Office during his stay in\r\nEngland, he may be effectually sat upon, and that he may receive \"that\r\nstyle of answer,\" a copy of which may be transmitted to Sir Francis, and\r\npublished in the Canadian papers, as a means of deterring further\r\n\"left-handed attacks upon the constitution.\" It may be added that the\r\nexpression of confidence above referred to was justified by the result,\r\nas Mr. Baldwin, during his stay in England, was not admitted to an\r\ninterview with Lord Glenelg, though a written statement of his views was\r\nreceived by his Lordship, and submitted to the Cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Reformers, moderate and radical, were brought closer together by the\r\nagitated state of the public mind, and by the efforts of the official\r\nparty to destroy their influence. Several weeks before the dissolution\r\nactually took place it became known that such a step was imminent, and\r\nquiet preparations were made for the general election which was to\r\nfollow. The formation of the Canadian Alliance Society by the Radicals,\r\ntowards the close of 1834, has already been referred to.[243] Neither\r\nthe platform of this society nor the mode of conducting it was such as\r\nto commend it to Reformers generally, and it was now deemed advisable to\r\norganize a new association on a broader basis, with a special eye to\r\ncooeperation with Reformers who resided in the rural districts. This was\r\naccordingly done under the auspices of some of the leading Reformers of\r\nToronto. In contradistinction to the British Constitutional Society\r\nmentioned towards the close of the last chapter, the new association was\r\ncalled the Constitutional Reform Society. Dr. Baldwin accepted the\r\nPresidency, and Francis Hincks, who was then engaged in commercial life\r\nin Toronto, was appointed Secretary. Steps were taken to counteract the\r\nmisrepresentations of the official party, and generally for the\r\nefficient maintenance of the impending election campaign. The Reformers\r\nseem to have greatly underestimated the efforts of their opponents. As\r\nthe event proved, they were also hopelessly astray in gauging the public\r\nopinion of the Province, for they looked forward to the approaching\r\ncontest with the utmost confidence in the result. The new society, it\r\nwas thought, would accomplish wonders in the way of thorough\r\norganization, and it was confidently believed that the existing Reform\r\nmajority in the Assembly would be fully maintained, if not increased.\r\nThe efforts of the official party to spread a belief prejudicial to the\r\npatriotism of the Reformers were laughed to scorn. So also was the\r\nattempt of the Lieutenant-Governor to imbue the inhabitants with a\r\nbelief in the probability of a foreign invasion. Upon the promulgation\r\nof the challenge to the imaginary invader, a number of the Toronto\r\nReformers, with Mr. Hincks at their head, amused themselves by\r\nperpetrating a practical joke. Having taken counsel together, they\r\nformed themselves into a deputation, and called upon his Excellency in a\r\nstate of well-assumed perturbation. In a formal address they expressed\r\nmuch solicitude on the subject of the contemplated invasion. They\r\nprofessed to re-echo his unbounded confidence in the Provincial militia,\r\nbut begged to be informed of the quarter whence the attack was\r\nanticipated. \"We do not doubt,\" said they, in their Address, \"the\r\nreadiness with which would be answered upon any emergency your appeal to\r\nthe militia, which appeal we are satisfied would not have been made\r\nwithout adequate cause. In a matter so seriously affecting the peace and\r\ntranquillity of the country, and the security of its commerce, we beg to\r\nlearn from your Excellency from what quarter the invasion is alleged to\r\nbe threatened.\" To this not unreasonable demand the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nwas unable to make any definite reply. The absurdity of his challenge\r\nwas for the first time fully brought home to him. According to the\r\ntestimony of eye-witnesses, he \"did not sit, but stood with that\r\npersonal oscillation which you witness in a man so situated as not well\r\nto know what to say or what to do.\"[244] When at last his reply came,\r\nit proved to be the briefest and most sensible of all his replies.\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"I have no further observations to make to you on\r\nthis subject.\" The deputation, struggling with suppressed laughter,\r\nwithdrew.\r\n\r\nThe Provincial Parliament was dissolved on the 28th of May, and as it\r\nwas thought desirable to strike while the iron was hot, the elections\r\nwere hurried on with unseemly haste. They began on the 20th of June, and\r\nall the returns were in during the first week in July. The issue was an\r\nexciting, but not a doubtful one, for the official party entered upon\r\nthe contest with loaded dice and a determination to win. Numerous\r\nattempts have been made to explain and excuse their conduct during this\r\neventful epoch; but it is impossible to blink the fact that the result\r\nwas a foregone conclusion from the very moment of the issue of the\r\nwrits. The whole weight of the Government was put forward to ensure the\r\nreturn of Tory candidates, and this was done in the most direct and\r\nshameless manner. The Lieutenant-Governor openly made himself a party to\r\nthe contest. His replies to the various addresses which he had himself\r\npromoted were one and all set to the same tune.[245] The issue was\r\npresented in such a light that no inconsiderable part of the population\r\nwere led to believe that the maintenance of British connection depended\r\nupon the result of the contest. Owing to the representations of\r\nGovernment emissaries, backed by the Tory press, and reinforced by the\r\ninflammatory speeches and addresses of the Lieutenant-Governor, it was\r\nwidely believed that should the Reformers succeed there would be a\r\nspeedy uprooting of cherished institutions, followed by separation from\r\nthe mother country and ultimate annexation to the United States. The\r\nindiscreet language of Mackenzie and some other Radicals had been such\r\nas to lend colour to misrepresentations of this nature, and the spirit\r\nthereby aroused was decisive of the result. Not only professed Tories,\r\nbut most of the moderate-minded of the population, rallied to the side\r\nof the Lieutenant-Governor, to uphold British connection, and to oppose\r\nthe encroachment of republican and revolutionary ideas. Loyalty was\r\nrampant, and patriotic fervour was aroused to a height which it had not\r\nreached in Upper Canada since the War of 1812. \"Down with democracy!\"\r\n\"Down with republicanism!\" \"Hurrah for Sir Francis Head and British\r\nconnection!\" Such were the legends inscribed on the dead-walls in the\r\nprincipal towns of the Province.[246] Tory votes were manufactured by\r\nwholesale, and Tory funds were squandered with reckless profusion. For\r\nthe first time in the history of Upper Canada, Government agents were\r\nsent down to the polling-places armed with patents for land, to be\r\ndistributed among the electors. It is open to doubt whether some of\r\nthese were not conferred upon persons who had no title to them.[247]\r\nReform votes were rejected by partisan returning-officers upon the most\r\nfrivolous pretexts. Gangs of ruffians were stationed at the polls to\r\nintimidate those who ventured near to record their votes in favour of\r\nanti-Government candidates. In at least one instance, the\r\nLieutenant-Governor presented himself in person at the polling-place\r\nwhile the contest was at its height, and remained there for some time on\r\nhorseback, in close proximity to the spot where votes were\r\nrecorded.[248] As for the Reformers, they were soon aroused from their\r\ndreams of confidence. But their rude awakening, early as it was, came\r\nall too late. They perceived that the seed had been well sown, and that\r\nthe crop would have to be reaped. They found themselves looked upon with\r\nsuspicion and dislike among their neighbours and others from whom they\r\nhad been accustomed to receive confidence and respect. They needed all\r\nthe courage of their opinions to support them against the obloquy which\r\nofficial slander had aroused. The courageous among them faced the polls\r\nin the spirit of a forlorn hope. The more timid quietly remained at home\r\nand refrained from voting, rather than subject themselves to certain\r\ninsult and probable physical violence.\r\n\r\nIt may perhaps be urged, in reply to some of the foregoing allegations,\r\nthat a Committee of the Assembly subsequently inquired into the various\r\nmatters complained of, and that their report acquitted the Governor of\r\nall culpability. But anyone who is familiar with the proceedings of\r\nelection committees in those days, and even in times much more recent,\r\nwill not need to be informed how much--or how little--weight should be\r\nattached to a verdict from such a source. In the case under\r\nconsideration, the proceedings were conducted with exceptional disregard\r\nto propriety, and the verdict of acquittal cannot be considered as of\r\nany value whatever. Only one member of the Committee heard the whole of\r\nthe evidence upon which the report was based. Three of the members\r\ndeclared that the report was adopted without their knowledge or consent.\r\nOf the other five members who prepared the document, one attended only\r\ntwo meetings out of fourteen; while another attended four, and another\r\nfive. A fourth member attended twelve meetings, and one only of the five\r\nattended all the fourteen. The inquiry was from first to last conducted\r\nin a spirit of partisanship, and the report, in the language of Dr.\r\nRolph, was \"the offspring of untempered zeal, insufficient evidence,\r\nhasty conclusions, and executive devotion.\"[249] As a general rule, it\r\nis a difficult matter to convict a Government of actual, direct\r\ninterference with the freedom of election. But in the case of the\r\ngeneral election of 1836, there is unfortunately no room for doubt. That\r\npatents were issued in great numbers by the Commissioner of Crown Lands,\r\nand despatched by the hands of trusted agents of the Government to the\r\npolling-places, to be used by the voters, is as well established as is\r\nthe fact of the election itself. Nay, the fact is admitted by Sir\r\nFrancis Head in the supplemental chapter to his \"Narrative,\" as well as\r\nby the Committee appointed by the Assembly to investigate the matter,\r\nand the attempts to explain it away are of the weakest kind. The number\r\nof patents issued was so great as to require a special staff of extra\r\nclerks to get them ready by the time they were wanted. In some cases the\r\npatents covered only a quarter of an acre of wild, uncultivated land,\r\nupon which no buildings had been erected. Many of them were issued\r\nbetween the date of the dissolution of Parliament and the close of the\r\nelection a month later,[250] and in some instances they were issued\r\nafter the actual opening of the poll. They were distributed openly at\r\nthe places where the elections were held, to persons who had not applied\r\nfor them, and who, at least in some instances, received them without\r\npaying the usual fees, merely that they might thereby be enabled to\r\nvote. Whether the issue of the patents affected the result of the\r\nelection in any single instance is altogether beside the question. It\r\nwould be absurd to pretend, in the face of such tactics as these, that\r\nthere was any real freedom of choice offered to the people in the matter\r\nof Parliamentary representation. Freedom of election was paralyzed.\r\nReform voters were literally overwhelmed, and their franchise rendered\r\nof no avail. All this was done with the cognizance and assent of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, who thereby wilfully violated the instructions\r\nwhich he had received from the Home Office.[251]\r\n\r\nThe result of an election contest conducted on these lines was such as\r\nto fully realize the expectations of Sir Francis and his advisers. Not\r\nonly were all the old Tory members returned--and this, in several cases,\r\nwithout any opposition--but a number of new adherents of that side found\r\nseats. Hagerman was returned for Kingston by acclamation, McLean was\r\nreturned for Stormont, George S. Jarvis for the Town of Cornwall, Jonas\r\nJones and Ogle B. Gowan for Leeds, A. N. MacNab for Wentworth, W. B.\r\nRobinson for Simcoe, Mahlon Burwell for the Town of London, Henry\r\nSherwood for Brockville, and William Henry Draper for Toronto. The\r\nlast-named gentleman, known to later times as Chief Justice Draper, now\r\nentered public life for the first time. He was a very decided\r\nacquisition to the ranks of Upper Canadian Toryism, and was destined to\r\nexert a wide and far-reaching influence upon successive representatives\r\nof the Crown in this colony. But the triumphs of the official party were\r\nnot confined to mere numerical successes. They wrested some important\r\nconstituencies from the hands of their opponents. The Reformers were not\r\nonly left in an insignificant minority, but nearly all their ablest\r\nmembers were defeated in what had long been regarded as safe Reform\r\nconstituencies. Bidwell and Perry suffered defeat in Lennox and\r\nAddington; Lount underwent a similar fate in Simcoe; and Mackenzie was\r\nsignally worsted in the Second Riding of York by a man of no political\r\nstanding. Gibson, Morrison and Mackintosh gained their respective\r\nelections in the other three Ridings of York, but none of them possessed\r\nmuch Parliamentary ability, or was to be depended upon in any great\r\nemergency. The one significant gain to the Reform party arose out of the\r\nelection of Dr. Rolph. The Doctor, after having allowed himself to be\r\ntalked into accepting a seat in the Executive Council whose resignation\r\nhad been the beginning of the contest between the Reformers and the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, had not felt himself at liberty to reject the\r\novertures of his friends. He had been put in nomination for the County\r\nof Norfolk, and his candidature had been successful. He was a host in\r\nhimself, and his return was the one streak of bright light which\r\nappeared in the Reform horizon at the close of the campaign.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most unsatisfactory feature about the whole unsatisfactory\r\nbusiness, from the Reform point of view, was that the ignominous\r\ndiscomfiture of the Reformers had been brought about by defections from\r\ntheir own ranks. Moderate-minded Reformers had come to think, with the\r\nConservatives, that even Family Compact domination was preferable to the\r\nascendency of such men as Mackenzie. The publication of the baneful\r\ndomination letter, followed, as it had been, by Tory misrepresentation,\r\nhad led thousands of persons to believe that the Radicals secretly\r\nfavoured the separation of the colony from Great Britain. The Wesleyan\r\nMethodists, a numerous body, were doubly impelled to oppose Mackenzie\r\nand all who favoured his cause. The quarrel between Mackenzie and the\r\nRev. Egerton Ryerson has already been referred to.[252] Mr. Ryerson was\r\nin those days one of the most prominent figures in Upper Canadian\r\nMethodism, and in conjunction with his brothers, exerted a predominant\r\ninfluence among the members of that body. At the time of the general\r\nelection of 1836 he was absent from the Province on a mission to\r\nEngland, whither he had gone to obtain a charter for the Upper Canada\r\nAcademy, and to solicit subscriptions for the establishment and\r\nmaintenance of that institution, which subsequently developed into the\r\nUniversity of Victoria College. But the reverend gentleman's arm was\r\nfar-reaching, and stretched across the broad expanse of the Atlantic. In\r\ncommon with a large and respectable portion of the Upper Canadian\r\npopulation, he cherished a feeling of personal contempt for Mackenzie,\r\nwhose character he thoroughly despised, and whose projects he regarded\r\nas prejudicial to the welfare of the colony. The publication of the\r\nbaneful domination letter had convinced him that rebellion and\r\nseparation were among the cherished schemes of the Radicals. To all such\r\nschemes he was prepared to oppose his firmest resistance, for his\r\nloyalty was of the perfervid order, and his dislike of Mackenzie\r\nprobably imparted additional zeal to his opposition. As has been seen,\r\nMackenzie, with the aid of Hume, Roebuck and other British statesmen,\r\nhad succeeded in creating in the minds of the English public\r\nconsiderable sympathy for Canadian Reform. To counteract this influence\r\nMr. Ryerson, under the signature of \"A Canadian,\" contributed a series\r\nof letters to the London _Times_. They were vigorously written, and\r\nattracted much attention, not only in England but in Canada, where they\r\nwere republished in the columns of the Tory newspapers, and where they\r\nwere circulated in pamphlet form as a campaign document. Mr. Ryerson\r\nalso wrote to leading members of the Methodist body in Canada, urging\r\nthem to cast all their influence for Government candidates, and against\r\nthe revolutionary policy of the Radicals. His appeals served their\r\npurpose, and the great bulk of the Wesleyan Methodists of Upper Canada,\r\nwho had theretofore supported Reform members, went over to the side of\r\nthe Government. In many constituencies--notably so in Lennox and\r\nAddington--they held the balance of power, and their secession from the\r\nReform cause decided the fortunes of the candidates.[253] A few remained\r\nunaffected by Mr. Ryerson's lucubrations, and some even went so far as\r\nto denounce his conduct and reply to his arguments, but these were too\r\nfew in number to affect the general result. Some of the successful\r\ncandidates were compelled to pledge themselves in advance to the\r\nMethodists and other Nonconformists to take immediate steps for the\r\nsettlement of the Clergy Reserves question, but the pledges were\r\nneglected or forgotten during the turbulent epoch which ensued.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that, as is clearly pointed out in the Report of\r\nLord Durham,[254] the contest which had been commenced on the question\r\nof a responsible Executive Council had afterwards been adroitly turned\r\nby the official party, and had been decided on very different grounds.\r\nThe question of a responsible Executive, as well as the question of the\r\nClergy Reserves, had for the time sunk out of public notice. All other\r\nmatters had given way to a resolve to return candidates who would \"rally\r\nround the throne.\" The triumph of the Government went far beyond what\r\nseveral members of it had ventured to anticipate. On the 8th of July,\r\nSir Francis was able to report to Lord Glenelg that \"the\r\nConstitutionists\"--by which name he designated the official party and\r\nall who supported them--had a majority of twenty-five,[255] whereas in\r\nthe preceding Assembly they had been in a minority of eleven. In the\r\nsame despatch he availed himself of the opportunity to malign Mr.\r\nBidwell, whom he characterized as the \"twin or Siamese companion of Mr.\r\nSpeaker Papineau.\" He descanted upon the powerful reaction which had\r\nbeen brought about, and exultingly informed his Lordship that of the\r\nfour candidates who had contested the constituency of Lennox and\r\nAddington Mr. Bidwell had polled the fewest votes.\r\n\r\nThe Colonial Minister must have been sore puzzled to know what to make\r\nof this gushing and galloping Lieutenant-Governor, who was so evidently\r\ndevoid of the peculiar qualifications supposed to be requisite for one\r\nin his station, and who framed his official despatches upon the model of\r\na sensation novel. Here was a man who had been selected for an elevated\r\nand honourable post because be had been supposed to be an adept in the\r\nscience of politics, but who, as it now turned out, was utterly\r\nunacquainted with the principles and practice of Government; who was\r\nignorant of the proprieties and amenities of official intercourse; who,\r\nin what were intended for grave official despatches, indulged in\r\nextracts from French vaudevilles, and referred to certain methods of\r\nprocedure as not being _according to Hoyle_! By all known theory and\r\nprecedent, the accession to office of such a man ought to have been\r\nattended by immediate and ignominous failure. Yet, so far as could be\r\njudged, he had by no means failed. Nay, he actually appeared to have\r\nscored a marvellous success, and to have brought about what men of\r\ngreater ability and wider experience had been utterly unable to\r\naccomplish. Such a success was an inscrutable mystery to the official\r\nmind, and Lord Glenelg, after the first few weeks, appears to have\r\nabandoned all attempts to penetrate it. The entire demeanour of this\r\nunconventional Lieutenant-Governor was incomprehensible. He had\r\nexpressed his total dissent from the policy of the Commissioners of\r\nInquiry in Lower Canada, who had reported in favour of a responsible\r\nExecutive.[256] He had even gone so far as to tender his resignation in\r\nconsequence of his inability to concur in the liberal measures of Reform\r\nadvocated by the Commissioners.[257] But the Home Government had by no\r\nmeans been disposed to accept his resignation just at that time. They\r\nhad no available person to put in his place, and it had been thought\r\ndesirable that he should be permitted to try his hand a little longer.\r\nAnd now this news as to the result of the elections seemed to fully\r\njustify their determination to retain him in office. If he had really\r\ninaugurated a new and improved order of things in Upper Canada, it was\r\nonly fair that he should enjoy the prestige of his success.\r\n\r\nBut the ill effects of Sir Francis's superficial and disastrous policy\r\nwere already beginning to be apparent to those whose eyes were keen\r\nenough to look below the surface of things. The Reformers felt that they\r\nhad been out-manoeuvred. That they could have borne, for they had\r\noften been compelled to bear a similar infliction in past times. But\r\nthey considered that they had been cheated out of their rights by one\r\nwhose especial duty it was to watch over and preserve those rights\r\ninviolate. They had endured much at the hands of a Gore, a Maitland and\r\na Colborne. But Gore, Maitland and Colborne had not presented themselves\r\nbefore them in the garb of tried Reformers. They had been the Tory\r\nemissaries of Tory superiors beyond sea, whose instructions they had\r\ngenerally carried out. All this had been changed; but the change, so\r\nfar as Upper Canada was concerned, had been for the worse. The Reformers\r\nof the Province felt that the man who had been placed at the helm of\r\nState--the man who had been sent over by an ostensibly Liberal\r\nGovernment to redress the accumulated wrongs of the past--was in some\r\nrespects far more dangerous than any of his predecessors had been.\r\nCarlyle had not then delivered his celebrated discourse on fools, but\r\nthe idea that a fool may sometimes be far more dread-inspiring than a\r\nwise man is sufficiently obvious, and had presented itself in vivid\r\nshape before the minds of a good many of the Reformers of Upper Canada.\r\nThey had by this time come to know something of Sir Francis Head. They\r\nhad brought themselves to regard him as not only a fool, but a fool\r\ndevoid of right feeling or principle; a fool who would stop at no\r\ninjustice or iniquity the perpetration whereof would conduce, in however\r\nsmall a degree, to his own glorification. He evidently regarded his\r\npersonal interference in the elections as a thing upon which he ought to\r\nplume himself. Such a state of things was not to be borne. It was clear\r\nthat life, for Canadian Reformers, would very soon be not worth living.\r\nThey despaired of the future, which, to their depressed vision, seemed\r\nto be overhung by a sky of unrelieved blackness. Their despair was\r\naccompanied by a smarting sense of defeat and injustice proportionate to\r\nthe circumstances. Such feelings were not confined to defeated\r\ncandidates and their immediate friends, but were participated in by\r\nReformers generally. Some of them began to weigh the advantages and\r\ndisadvantages of removal from the Province. Others, after the first\r\neffervescence of disappointment had expended itself, determined to\r\nendure in patience and to hope for the best. A comparatively small\r\nnumber, yielding to the influence of mingled despair and exasperation,\r\nbegan to contemplate armed resistance to authority as among the\r\npossibilities of the near future. Constitutional resistance, they\r\nthought, had had a fair trial. Might it not be worth while to try a more\r\ndrastic remedy?\r\n\r\nConspicuous among the personages who were strongly influenced by such\r\nthoughts as those last indicated was William Lyon Mackenzie, who, as\r\npreviously mentioned, had lost his election in the Second Riding of\r\nYork. It might have been supposed that if any constituency in the\r\nProvince was beyond the reach of Tory influence, the Second Riding was\r\nentitled to that distinction. It was notoriously the most Radical\r\nconstituency in the colony. It had stood loyally by Mackenzie all\r\nthrough the troubled epoch of the successive expulsions. Yet it had now\r\nthrown him overboard on behalf of a political nobody. The explanation is\r\nto be found in the fact that the Riding had been the scene of some of\r\nthe moat scandalous abuses committed during the campaign. The Tories had\r\nresolved that Mackenzie should be defeated at any cost, and had resorted\r\nto the most reprehensible means to secure that end. To elect a professed\r\nTory would have been an impossibility, so the person fixed upon to\r\noppose him was one whom the author of \"Middlemarch\" might have had in\r\nher eye when she described Sir James Chettam as \"a man of acquiescent\r\ntemper, miscellaneous opinions and uncertain vote.\"[258] His name was\r\nEdward William Thomson, and he professed to be a moderate Reformer. His\r\nmoderation was acceptable to a considerable proportion of the electors,\r\nmany of whom were tired of Mackenzie. The official party, however, did\r\nnot choose to rely upon legitimate means for defeating the Radical\r\ncandidate. Money was spent freely, and brawny bullies were hired for\r\npurposes of intimidation. Good votes were rejected on one side, and bad\r\nones accepted on the other. Patents were sent down to the polling place,\r\ncertain recipients whereof voted for Thomson. Sheriff Jarvis attended,\r\nand by his language and demeanour did what he could to discourage\r\nMackenzie's supporters. Not a stone was left unturned to effect the\r\ndesired object. Such means as Mackenzie had at his command were\r\naltogether insufficient to counteract the devices employed against him.\r\nHe was beaten, and by a majority of a hundred votes.\r\n\r\nThis result took Mackenzie completely by surprise. It came upon him in\r\nthe form of a revelation. He had not permitted himself to entertain any\r\ndoubt of his success, and the conviction that he had lost his\r\npopularity cut him to his inmost soul. He retired to the house of one of\r\nhis supporters in the neighbourhood, where he completely broke down, and\r\nwept with a bitterness which evoked the active sympathy of those\r\npresent. But this mood did not last. It was succeeded by a sullenness\r\nand stolidity such as had never before been observed in him. He knew\r\nthat he had been beaten unfairly, and resolved to petition against the\r\nelection. Meanwhile his rage against the party which had been concerned\r\nin his defeat was ungovernable, and must have vent. He resolved that he\r\nmust again have control of a newspaper. He accordingly established _The\r\nConstitution_, a weekly paper, the first number of which made its\r\nappearance in Toronto on the sixtieth anniversary of the Declaration of\r\nIndependence of the United States--namely, the 4th of July, 1836. Its\r\ntone was such as might have been anticipated from the mood of its\r\neditor. It was more outspoken than the _Advocate_ had ever been under\r\nhis management, and might from the first have been styled a\r\nrevolutionary organ. In its columns every phase of discontent found\r\nutterance, and some of its editorial articles were marked by a spirit of\r\nbitterness and implacability such as had not commonly been supposed to\r\nbelong to Mackenzie's nature. Means would doubtless have been taken for\r\nits suppression, had not the Government felt that they had achieved a\r\nsignal triumph, and that they could afford to ignore its attacks.\r\n\r\nMany others of the Radicals felt little less rancour towards the\r\nGovernment party than did Mackenzie. Indeed, the conduct of the party in\r\npower had been such as to make temporary Radicals of not a few persons\r\nwho had theretofore been known as moderate Reformers. It may be said\r\nindeed that nearly all the moderates had either made common cause with\r\nthe Government party for fear of the Radicals, or had coalesced with the\r\nRadicals from a sense of official tyranny and injustice. Public meetings\r\nwere held, at which the Lieutenant-Governor and his myrmidons were\r\nsubjected to the most vehement denunciations. At a meeting of the\r\nConstitutional Reform Society Dr. Baldwin, George Ridout, James E. Small\r\nand others referred to his Excellency's conduct in terms which public\r\naudiences had never before heard from their lips. An official address\r\nissued by the Society on the subject of the resignation of the\r\nExecutive Councillors also contained some severe but well-merited\r\nstrictures. The Lieutenant-Governor marked his condemnation of the\r\nlanguage employed by promptly dismissing the three gentlemen above named\r\nfrom certain offices which they held.[259] As will hereafter be seen,\r\nthis proceeding eventually led to serious complications between the Home\r\nOffice and Sir Francis. Meantime, the latter was permitted to have his\r\nown way, but not without stubborn attempts at resistance on the part of\r\nsome of his opponents. A number of the most pronounced Radicals resolved\r\nto make a strong representation of election and other abuses to the\r\nBritish House of Commons, and to that end sent Dr. Charles Duncombe to\r\nEngland. Dr. Duncombe had been re-elected for Oxford, but had had to\r\ncontend against similar influences to those which had been employed in\r\nother constituencies, and was thus able to speak of the partisan conduct\r\nof the Lieutenant-Governor's emissaries from personal observation. He\r\nprepared a statement of the case against Sir Francis, which was laid\r\nbefore the House of Commons by Mr. Hume. The Colonial Secretary\r\ndespatched a copy of it to Sir Francis for explanations. It is unlikely\r\nthat Dr. Duncombe's mission would have been a successful one under any\r\ncircumstances, but he made the mistake of protesting too much. The\r\ngreater part of the indictment could easily have been substantiated\r\nbefore any impartial tribunal, but it also contained charges which,\r\nwhether true or not, the prosecutor was unable to prove. As mentioned on\r\na former page[260], the matter was referred to a Committee of the\r\nProvincial Assembly, by whom the Lieutenant-Governor was completely\r\nexonerated. A further reference to the matter will be made in connection\r\nwith the proceedings of the following session.\r\n\r\nThe Lieutenant-Governor was meanwhile engaged in a voluminous\r\ncorrespondence with the Colonial Secretary. The subjects dealt with\r\ntherein were many and various. Perhaps the most important of all was\r\nthe Lower Canadian Commission of Inquiry. The Commissioners had made a\r\nreport in which they had recommended the concession of Responsible\r\nGovernment, and other much-needed Reforms. As previously mentioned, Sir\r\nFrancis had no sympathy with these views, and distinctly repudiated the\r\npolicy thus recommended. The idea of a responsible Executive was utterly\r\nrepugnant to him. He erelong perceived that the Imperial Government\r\nwould sooner or later yield to the imperative demand made on behalf of\r\nthe different British North American colonies, but he determined to\r\nfight against it as long as opposition was possible, and his despatches\r\nteem with what he doubtless regarded as arguments on the negative side.\r\nHe predicted the most serious results if the policy of the Commissioners\r\nwas adopted. The language of the Ninety-two resolutions of the Lower\r\nCanada Assembly he pronounced to be not only insulting to the British\r\nGovernment, but traitorous. He proposed various measures for\r\nestablishing the power of the Crown in the Canadas on a firm basis.\r\nAmong these were the repeal of the Act surrendering the revenue, the\r\nannexation of the District of Gaspe to the Province of New Brunswick,\r\nand the annexation of Montreal to Upper Canada. It may safely be assumed\r\nthat these ideas were not his own, and nobody who has read \"Canada and\r\nthe Canada Bill,\"[261] published several years later, will entertain\r\nmuch doubt as to the individual from whom he derived his inspiration.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[236] Sir Francis afterwards denied that this challenge was addressed to\r\nthe Americans. See his despatch to Lord Glenelg dated 6th November,\r\n1836, embodied in his _Narrative_, chap, vi. But it is quite evident\r\nthat the denial, as well as the construction there sought to be put upon\r\nhis language, was an after-thought. If, as he there asserts, \"the\r\nAmericans had no more to do with the subject than the Chinese,\" there\r\nwas no appropriate significance whatever in his doughty defiance.\r\n\r\n[237] See despatch of May 28th.\r\n\r\n[238] See despatch of 21st April.\r\n\r\n[239] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[240] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[241] Despatch of May 28th.\r\n\r\n[242] Of April 28th.\r\n\r\n[243] _Ante_, p. 281.\r\n\r\n[244] See Dr. Rolph's _Speech to the House in Committee on the Report of\r\nthe Select Committee on the Petition of Dr. Charles Duncombe to the\r\nBritish House of Commons_, delivered on Monday, January 30th, 1837.\r\n\r\n[245] It was afterwards urged by Sir Francis that his replies to\r\naddresses were made before, and not during the election. The plea will\r\nnot bear a moment's examination. The mischief was done by the\r\ninflammatory and menacing tone of the replies, and the mere question of\r\nthe time of their delivery in of no importance whatever. An English\r\nwriter thus effectually disposes of this attempted defence: \"Surely he\r\n[Sir F. B. Head] must have some glimmering perception that this is not a\r\nquestion of time, and that, if promises or threats are addressed to the\r\nelectoral body with regard to their exercise of the electoral franchise,\r\nit is a matter of no importance whether this is done before or at the\r\ntime of the election. Illogical as he has proved himself, we cannot\r\nsuppose him to be so utterly destitute of the reasoning faculty as a\r\nsincerity in this defence would imply; and we must therefore believe\r\nthat he knows the charge to be well founded, and has recourse to this\r\nshuffling evasion in pure despair.\"--See _London and Westminster\r\nReview_, vol. xxxii., No. 2, article vi.\r\n\r\n[246] During the contest people on the hustings actually demanded of the\r\ncandidates: \"Do you vote for the House of Assembly or for Sir Francis\r\nHead?\"--a question which, as Sir Francis himself remarks, amounted in\r\nplain terms to this: \"Are you for a republican government, or are you\r\nnot?\"--See _Memorandum on the Present Political State of the Canadas_,\r\nin _Narrative_, chap. vi.\r\n\r\n[247] Lord Durham, reasoning from such evidence as he had before him,\r\nproceeds upon the assumption that no patents were issued except to\r\npersons entitled to the land. But, as his Lordship admits, the granting\r\nof patents at all under such circumstances was an act of official\r\nfavouritism which no Lieutenant-Governor with a proper sense of his duty\r\nwould have permitted. See _Report_, U.C. folio edition, p. 51.\r\n\r\n[248] This was at Streetsville, while the contest for the Second Riding\r\nof York was in progress between William Lyon Mackenzie and Edward\r\nWilliam Thomson.\r\n\r\n[249] See his speech in the Assembly on January 30th, 1837.\r\n\r\n[250] From official returns it appears that 1,478 patents passed the\r\nGreat Seal between the 20th of April (the date of the prorogation) and\r\nthe close of the contest in June. Of this number 1,245 were issued in\r\npursuance of Orders in Council made prior to Sir Francis Head's arrival\r\nin the Province. Between his arrival and the close of the election 233\r\nwere issued, whereof only 150 were issued under Order in Council on his\r\nauthority. But that the entire 1,478 were passed under Sir Francis's\r\nregime within a very brief period; that a special staff of clerks was\r\nemployed for the purpose; that for the first time in the history of the\r\nProvince these patents were distributed at the polling-booths by\r\nGovernment agents who were strong adherents of the official party, and\r\nwho were moreover dependent upon the Government for their\r\nsituations--these are circumstances which admit of but one brief\r\nexplanation. The only one of these agents whom the Committee of Inquiry\r\nventured to summon before them was Mr. Welsley Richey, of Barrie, who,\r\non his examination, deposed that he mentioned to the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nthat the persons who wanted their deeds were entitled to them, and that\r\n_he thought they would vote for Constitutional candidates_; that Sir F.\r\nB. Head strictly commanded witness not in any manner to interfere as\r\nGovernment agent, or to use any influence which his situation gave him\r\nat the election; that out of a number not exceeding 130 patents which\r\npersons residing in the County of Simcoe were entitled to, and which\r\nwere in witness's possession for them, only about thirty were called\r\nfor, and only part of that thirty voted. This is mere petty evasion. As\r\npointed out in the text, the extent to which such tactics as these\r\naffected the result is not the chief question to be decided. The mere\r\nfact that they were employed is sufficient to settle the question of\r\nculpability. Richey was directed not to interfere with the elections as\r\n_Government agent_. How was it possible for an official known to be\r\nconnected with the Government to divest himself of the influence\r\ninseparable from such a connection, more especially when his strong\r\npolitical bias was well known, and when he presented himself at the poll\r\nas a distributor of deeds among the voters? The mere fact of a\r\nconference on such a subject between the head of the Government and a\r\nsubordinate is in itself a suspicious circumstance.\r\n\r\n[251] In Lord Goderich's despatch to Sir John Colborne, dated 8th\r\nNovember, 1832, referred to _ante_, p. 246, the following language is\r\nemployed: \"His Majesty expects and requires of you neither to practise,\r\nnor to allow on the part of those who are officially subordinate to you,\r\nany interference with the rights of his subjects to the free and\r\nunbiased choice of their representatives;\" and, as previously\r\nmentioned, Lord Glenelg had expressly instructed Sir Francis Head to\r\nadopt that despatch as a rule for the guidance of his conduct. See\r\n_ante_, p. 301.\r\n\r\n[252] _Ante_, p. 272.\r\n\r\n[253] Sir Francis Hincks, who, as previously mentioned in the text, then\r\nresided in Toronto, and was identified with the Reform party, has, in\r\nhis _Reminiscences_, recorded his views on this subject, and as they are\r\nfounded upon personal experience and recollection they are worth\r\nquoting. \"Bearing in mind,\" he writes, \"that there are exceptions to all\r\ngeneral rules, I think that I am not wrong in my belief that the members\r\nof the Church of England and the Presbyterians generally voted for the\r\nTory candidates, while the Roman Catholics and the Baptists,\r\nCongregationalists, etc., voted as uniformly for the Reformers. The\r\nWesleyan Methodists held the balance of power in a great many\r\nconstituencies, and I believe that it has been generally acknowledged\r\nthat the elections in 1836 were carried against the Reformers by their\r\nvotes.\" Again: \"I believe that I am correct in asserting that Sir\r\nFrancis Head carried the elections in 1836 against the Reformers mainly\r\nthrough the influence of the Rev. Egerton Ryerson, who, though\r\nabsent from Canada at the time, had, by his published impressions,\r\ninduced those who confided in him to abandon the Reform\r\ncause.\"--_Reminiscences_, etc., pp. 17, 18.\r\n\r\n[254] U.C. folio edition, p, 49.\r\n\r\n[255] The House contained in all only sixty-two members, so that a\r\nmajority of twenty-five constituted what might be called absolute\r\ncontrol. The actual majority was twenty-six, as there were but eighteen\r\nReform representatives as against forty-four supporters of the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n[256] See his despatch of 1st June.\r\n\r\n[257] _Ib._\r\n\r\n[258] This language aptly characterizes Mr. Thomson, for afterwards, in\r\nthe Assembly, it was impossible to predict how he would vote on any\r\nconceivable question. His \"Reform\" principles must have been very\r\n\"moderate,\" for he frequently supported the measures of the Compact. His\r\nvotes seem to have been dictated by chance or caprice, rather than\r\npolitical conviction of any kind.\r\n\r\n[259] Dr. Baldwin was Judge of the Surrogate Court of the Home\r\nDistrict. His dismissal was probably due quite as much to the fact\r\nthat he was President of the Society as to his remarks about the\r\nLieutenant-Governor, or to the official address. Mr. Ridout was Judge of\r\nthe Niagara District Court, Justice of the Peace, and Colonel of the\r\nSecond Regiment of East York Militia. He was dismissed from all three\r\noffices, although he was not a member of the Reform Society. Mr. Small\r\nwas Commissioner of the Court of Requests in Toronto, and also\r\nLieutenant-Colonel of the First East York Militia.\r\n\r\n[260] _Ante_, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[261] Written by Chief Justice Robinson, in opposition to the project\r\nfor uniting the two Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nREACTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe closing weeks of the summer and a part of the early autumn were\r\nspent by the Lieutenant-Governor in an informal tour through some of the\r\nmost interesting and picturesque districts of the Province. A great part\r\nof the tour, which occupied in all about two months, was performed on\r\nhorseback, and with only two attendants. A pleasantly-written account of\r\nsome of the experiences encountered during this invigorating holiday may\r\nbe found in \"The Emigrant,\" a light, sketchy, and most readable little\r\nvolume put forth by Sir Francis ten years afterwards. Soon after his\r\nreturn to the Seat of Government his self-complacency received a check\r\nin the form of a despatch from the Colonial Office, enclosing copies of\r\ninstructions which had been sent to Sir Archibald Campbell,\r\nLieutenant-Governor of New Brunswick. It appeared that the strenuous\r\nexertions of the Reformers of that Province had been crowned with\r\nsuccess. Sir Archibald had been directed to surrender to the Assembly\r\nthe casual and territorial revenues of the Crown, and to concede a\r\nresponsible Executive. This was not all. Sir Francis was himself\r\ndistinctly informed that what had been conceded in one British North\r\nAmerican Province could not be withheld from the rest. Scarcely had this\r\npiece of intelligence been chewed and digested ere he received another\r\ndespatch which added to his discomfiture by confirming the previous one,\r\nand by seating the obnoxious doctrine at his very door. He was\r\ninstructed that the Executive Councils in the various North American\r\ncolonies were thenceforward to be composed of individuals possessing the\r\nconfidence of the people. This, though not altogether unexpected, was\r\nalmost past bearing. He saw the house of cards which he had constructed\r\nwith such pains about to crumble before him. If this course were\r\npersisted in, all his efforts to pack a House of Assembly would erelong\r\nprove to have been made in vain; for no Assembly would permanently\r\nuphold a clique of Councillors in whose appointment they themselves had\r\nhad no voice, and in whose principles they had no confidence. Sir\r\nArchibald Campbell and he were entirely of one mind as to the vexed\r\nquestion at issue, and they were both firmly determined to resist such a\r\npolicy to the last ditch. Of Sir Archibald's proceedings it is\r\nunnecessary for this work to present any detailed account. It will be\r\nsufficient to say that he preferred to resign his office rather than\r\nobey the instructions he had received, and that he carried out this\r\nresolve during the following year, when he was succeeded by Sir John\r\nHarvey. Sir Francis Head meanwhile contented himself as best he could\r\nwith vehement protests addressed to the Home Office. \"The more seriously\r\nI contemplate the political tranquillity of this Province,\" he\r\nwrote,[262] \"the more steadfastly am I confirmed in my opinion that cool,\r\nstern, decisive, un-conciliating measures form the most popular\r\ndescription of government that can be exercised towards the free and\r\nhigh-minded inhabitants of the Canadas.\" The style of his despatches did\r\nnot improve with time. It was wordy, bombastic and slangy. The\r\ndespatches themselves were largely made up of inflated, impertinent\r\nphraseology, and quotations from the light literature of the period.\r\nLord Glenelg, however, had become accustomed to the unconventional\r\nmethods of his protege, and was by no means disposed to judge him with\r\nseverity. On the 8th of September he wrote to him to the effect that his\r\n\"foresight, energy and moral courage\" had been approved of by the King.\r\n\"It is peculiarly gratifying to me,\" wrote his Lordship, \"to be the\r\nchannel of conveying to you this high and honourable testimony of His\r\nMajesty's favourable acceptance of your services.\" From all which it is\r\nsufficiently apparent that the real state of Upper Canadian affairs was\r\nnot much more clearly understood by the Colonial Office than by Sir\r\nFrancis Head.\r\n\r\nThe new Parliament was assembled on the 8th of November. Archibald\r\nMcLean, of Stormont, was elected Speaker by a majority of fifteen, the\r\nvote standing thirty-six to twenty-one. This vote did not by any means\r\nindicate the full strength of the Government, which was simply\r\nirresistible. The power of the Compact was not only completely restored,\r\nbut increased. Never had its ascendency been so great. It was absolute,\r\noverwhelming; and any opposition to it was a bootless kicking against\r\nthe pricks. In the Speech from the Throne his Excellency congratulated\r\nthe Houses on the loyal feeling pervading the Province, and on the\r\nstillness and serenity of the public mind. He drew attention to \"the\r\nconspicuous tranquillity of the country,\" and briefly referred to the\r\nlegislation contemplated by the Government, which, as thus indicated,\r\nwas of an exceedingly practical character. The Speech concluded with a\r\ndeclaration of his Excellency's intention \"to maintain the happy\r\nconstitution of this Province inviolate.\" If the Speech, as a whole,\r\ncontained a faithful reflex of the official mind, it indicated that the\r\nGovernment greatly misjudged the state of opinion in the country. True,\r\nthere was little conspicuous agitation, for the Reform party had\r\nsustained so signal a defeat that they for the time felt powerless. But\r\nthey were feverishly sensible of the crushing blow that had been dealt\r\nthem, and reeled from it in a spirit which was far removed from\r\n\"serenity.\" Scores of them despaired of the future, sold out their\r\nbelongings, and removed to the United States. During the months of\r\nSeptember and October there had been a considerable emigration of\r\nfarmers from the western part of the Province to Michigan. Such was the\r\n\"tranquillity\" upon which Sir Francis plumed himself, and upon which he\r\ncontinued to dilate at recurring intervals until he was roused from his\r\nslumbers by the intelligence that \"the rebels\" were at Montgomery's.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature at once proceeded to pass a Bill to provide for the\r\nsupport of the Civil Government for the current year, a circumstance of\r\nwhich the Lieutenant-Governor hastened to apprise Lord Glenelg. Various\r\nmatters of importance occupied the attention of Parliament during the\r\nsession. Among other questions which came up for discussion was the\r\nlong-standing grievance of the Clergy Reserves. On Thursday, the 8th of\r\nDecember, a Bill was introduced into the Assembly by Hiram Norton,\r\nmember for Grenville, having for its object the disposal of the Reserves\r\nfor purposes of general education. It passed the second reading on the\r\n13th of the same month, whereupon the House, in Committee of the Whole,\r\nafter several days consideration and discussion, reported a resolution\r\nin favour of appropriating the Clergy Reserves lands and the proceeds\r\narising from the sales thereof to the religious and moral instruction of\r\nthe people. This gave rise to a motion of amendment by Dr. Rolph, \"That\r\nit is expedient to provide for the sale of the Clergy Reserves, and the\r\napplication of the proceeds to the purposes of general education, as one\r\nof the most legitimate ways of giving free scope to the progress of\r\nreligious truth in the community.\" In support of this amendment the\r\nDoctor made what was unquestionably the most noteworthy speech of his\r\nlife--a speech which a well-known writer[263] has pronounced to be\r\nwithout a parallel in the annals of Canadian Parliamentary debate. Its\r\ncopiousness and felicity of illustration, its fluent and harmonious\r\nelegance of diction, could not have failed to stamp it as a great effort\r\nif it had been delivered before any audience in the world. No higher\r\npraise can be awarded to it than to record the simple fact that it added\r\nto the Doctor's already high reputation as an orator, and that it evoked\r\nthe admiration of many persons who could not subscribe to the doctrines\r\nand arguments it contained. But no oratory and no arguments would have\r\navailed with that House. The amendment was lost, and on Friday, the\r\n16th, the original resolution was carried by a vote of thirty-five to\r\ntwenty-one. The matter was then referred to the Upper House for its\r\nconcurrence. As the measure fell through during the session, and\r\nultimately came to nothing, it seems unnecessary to follow its fortunes\r\nany farther.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1837.]\r\n\r\nDr. Rolph made another powerful speech during the session; a speech\r\nwhich would of itself have entitled him to a high place as a\r\nParliamentary orator, and which was inferior in vigour only to the one\r\non the Clergy Reserves. It arose out of Dr. Duncombe's charges against\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor. Having received from the Colonial Secretary a\r\ncopy of the complaint which had been submitted to the House of Commons,\r\nhis Excellency, who was of course able to rely implicitly upon the\r\nAssembly as then constituted, handed it over to that body to be dealt\r\nwith. The result fully justified his confidence. A partisan Committee\r\nwas appointed, by whom the question was approached in a spirit very far\r\nremoved from judicial fairness. How the inquiry was conducted has\r\nalready been recorded.[264] Dr. Duncombe had made certain charges, some\r\nof which were easily susceptible of positive proof, while others were\r\nfrom their nature of a kind which admitted of nothing stronger than\r\nindirect evidence. With regard to one or two damnatory charges, he\r\nimplicitly believed them to be true, but he failed to secure any\r\nsubstantial proof whatever. He presented himself once before the\r\nCommittee, only to find, as he had expected, that he must not look to\r\nobtain a fair or patient hearing. Under these circumstances he felt that\r\nnothing was to be gained by any further attempt to establish the truth\r\nof his allegations, and permitted the case to go by default. The\r\nCommittee accordingly proceeded to take evidence on their own\r\nresponsibility. The verdict arrived at was such as might easily have\r\nbeen foreseen. Every charge and insinuation made against his Excellency\r\nwas declared to be \"wholly and utterly destitute of truth.\" Not only was\r\nhis conduct vindicated in this comprehensive manner, but he was referred\r\nto as one to whom the Province owed a large debt of gratitude. In due\r\ncourse the report came before the Assembly on a motion for its adoption.\r\nThe proceeding had from the first been of the nature of a practical\r\nimpeachment of the Lieutenant-Governor, a matter which was really beyond\r\nthe jurisdiction of any Canadian tribunal. It afforded to Dr. Rolph an\r\nopportunity for addressing the House at considerable length, and in a\r\nspeech which, as remarked by Mr. Mackenzie's biographer, \"will ever be\r\nmemorable in Canadian history.\"[265] It was delivered on the 30th of\r\nJanuary, 1837. It dealt in most trenchant fashion with the various\r\nabuses which had been practised during the elections. The serio-comic\r\ntone which pervaded a great part of it evoked roars of laughter, while\r\nits more earnest passages aroused the most conflicting feelings in the\r\nminds of the auditors. True oratory is never altogether fruitless, and\r\nit would seem as if this powerful speech must have given the spur to\r\nfeelings which, sooner or later, were bound to produce specific results.\r\nSo far, however, as any immediate effects upon the action of the House\r\nwere concerned, it might as well have remained unuttered. The report was\r\nadopted by a vote of more than two-thirds of the members present, and\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor stood officially exonerated from blame.\r\n\r\nAmong other matters presented for the consideration of the Assembly was\r\na petition from Mr. Mackenzie. Ever since the election, he had publicly\r\nannounced his determination to petition against the return in the Second\r\nRiding of York. He was prevented by illness from filing his memorial\r\nwithin the prescribed period, and an extension of time was obtained on\r\nhis behalf. He got together a great mass of evidence, some portions of\r\nwhich the Government would certainly have found it hard to answer to the\r\npublic satisfaction. He was jubilant, and openly boasted that he would\r\nexpose such a mass of corruption as would make the country stare aghast.\r\nHe was however so intent on collecting evidence and on discounting his\r\ncontemplated triumph over his enemies that he failed to enter into the\r\nnecessary recognizance until the allotted period for doing so had\r\nelapsed. The statute governing the case required that the petitioner\r\nshould enter into recognizance within fourteen days from the\r\npresentation of the petition. In this case the petition was presented on\r\nthe 20th of December, 1836, so that the fourteen days expired on the 3rd\r\nof January, 1837. \"If at the expiration of the said fourteen days\"--so\r\nran the statute--\"such recognizance shall not have been entered into,\r\nthe Speaker shall report the same to the House, and the order for\r\ntaking such petition into consideration shall thereupon be discharged;\r\nunless, upon matter specially stated and verified to the satisfaction of\r\nthe House, the House shall see cause to enlarge the time for entering\r\ninto such recognizance.\" Accordingly, on the opening of the House on\r\nWednesday, the 4th of January, Mr. Speaker McLean announced that the\r\ntime limited for W. L. Mackenzie, the petitioning candidate for the\r\nrepresentation of the Second Riding of York, to proceed upon his\r\npetition, had expired. Mr. Boulton, one of the members for Durham, then\r\nmoved that the further consideration of the petition be discharged. Dr.\r\nMorrison sought to obtain additional time for the furnishing of the\r\nstatutory recognizance, but the House was under no obligation to grant\r\nany indulgence, and after a long debate declined to do so. Mr. Boulton's\r\nmotion was carried; whereupon Dr. Morrison moved that Mr. Mackenzie have\r\nleave to present a new petition. The House negatived this motion, and\r\nMr. Thomson was confirmed in his seat. The matter was again brought\r\nbefore the notice of the House a few days afterwards by Dr. Morrison,\r\nwho moved that Mr. Mackenzie be allowed further time to enter into the\r\nrequisite security. The motion was made in order to give Dr. Rolph--who\r\nhad not been present during the former discussion--an opportunity of\r\nspeaking on the subject. The member for Norfolk delivered himself of a\r\nvigorous and subtle argument, in the course of which he reviewed the\r\nEnglish practice, as well as the practice which had generally prevailed\r\nin similar cases in Upper Canada. The fourteen days, he argued, should\r\nbe computed from the time when the petition was read to the House, not\r\nfrom the date when it was handed in. The presentation referred to in the\r\nstatute, he alleged, was not complete until the reading of the petition,\r\nwhich could not take place until it had lain on the table two days.\r\nStill further, the petitioner's delay had been in part due to the Clerk\r\nof the House, who had led Mr. Mackenzie to believe that the fourteen\r\ndays would not begin to run against him until two days after the\r\ndelivery of the petition. The argument throughout was plausible and\r\npowerful, but it shared the fate of many other powerful appeals in those\r\ndays. The motion was lost. There seems to have been a strong\r\ndetermination on the part of the Government to burke the investigation.\r\nThis was suggestive of a fear of the result, and was so regarded by\r\nmany wholly disinterested persons. Some of the charges were of the\r\ngravest nature, and, if the Government had felt that their skirts were\r\nclean, it is incomprehensible that they should not have availed\r\nthemselves of such an opportunity of establishing the fact by official\r\nrecord. There seems but too good reason to believe that, if the inquiry\r\nhad been proceeded with, Mackenzie would have made good his boast, and\r\nthat a disgraceful exposure of Executive corruption would have been\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nOne of the significant measures of the session was an Act to prevent the\r\ndissolution of the Provincial Parliament upon the demise of the Crown.\r\nThe desire of the Executive for such an enactment arose in this manner.\r\nDuring the brief election campaign of the preceding summer the most\r\ntempting promises had been made to the electors on behalf of the\r\nGovernment. This had been done with the full knowledge and consent--nay,\r\nprobably at the instigation--of the members of the Government\r\nthemselves. The fulfilment of some of the promises would have been\r\nfeasible enough. Others had been as absurdly impossible of fulfilment as\r\nwere Jack Cade's pledges that seven halfpenny loaves should be sold for\r\na penny, and that the three-hooped pot should have ten hoops. The\r\nGovernment now realized that their performances were far from being\r\ncommensurate with the promises so lavishly made. In the event of a new\r\nelection taking place within the next few months it would be easy for\r\nthe Reformers to make out a strong case, and it would be hard for the\r\nGovernment party to reply thereto with effect. It seemed not improbable\r\nthat a new election might erelong become necessary, for King William the\r\nFourth was more than three score and ten years old, and was known to be\r\nin a state of health which rendered it unlikely that he would live much\r\nlonger. Now, his death, in the ordinary course of things, would bring\r\nabout a dissolution and a general election, and this was the contingency\r\nagainst which it was thought desirable to guard. A measure was\r\naccordingly passed whereby it was enacted \"That the Parliament of this\r\nProvince shall not in any case be deemed to be determined or dissolved\r\nby the death or demise of His Majesty, his heirs or successors; nor\r\nshall any session of the Parliament of this Province be deemed to be\r\ndetermined, or the proceedings therein pending in any manner abated,\r\ninterrupted or affected by the demise of His Majesty, his heirs or\r\nsuccessors; but notwithstanding such death or demise the Parliament of\r\nthis Province shall continue, and, if sitting, shall proceed to act\r\nuntil dissolved or prorogued in the usual manner, or until the legal\r\nexpiration of the term of such Parliament.\" The Reformers fought this\r\nBill inch by inch on its way through the Assembly, but in vain. Upon its\r\ncoming up for its third reading, Norton, of Grenville, moved its\r\nrecommittal, and, upon the defeat of his motion, he made a final effort\r\nby moving \"That the Act shall not go into operation before the\r\nexpiration of the present Parliament.\" This, too, was defeated, and the\r\nBill was finally passed by a vote of twenty-six to eighteen. The measure\r\nis suggestive of the English Act passed by the Long Parliament during\r\nthe reign of Charles the First, which enacted that Parliament should not\r\nbe dissolved by the King without its own consent.\r\n\r\nThere was a good deal of extravagant legislation during the session.\r\nLarge sums were voted for the construction and improvement of Provincial\r\nhighways, for surveys of the Ottawa River and the territory contiguous\r\nthereto, for the improvement of the navigation of the Trent and Grand\r\nRivers, for the completion of the Welland Canal, and for the\r\nconstruction of various other canals, harbours, and lighthouses.\r\nProvision was also made for loans to several railway and other\r\ncompanies. Most, perhaps of all these, were enterprises deserving of aid\r\nand encouragement, but the aggregate sum of the moneys voted was nearly\r\nfour millions of dollars, being considerably more than the condition of\r\nthe Province and the circumstances of the people justified. This\r\nexceeding liberality was probably to some extent due to a wish to\r\nrespond to the popular demand for the expenditure of money on public\r\nimprovements. It was during this session that an Act was passed\r\nproviding for the establishment of a Provincial Court of Chancery. Mr.\r\nJameson was soon after appointed Vice Chancellor, the Chancellorship\r\nbeing vested in the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe session terminated on Saturday, the 4th of March, and its\r\ntermination was attended by a scene of \"most admired disorder\" in the\r\nAssembly. The project of uniting the Provinces of Upper and Lower Canada\r\nhad occupied a certain amount of attention on the part of both Houses,\r\nand had been on the order of the day throughout the greater part of the\r\nsession. When the final day of deliberation arrived, the Legislative\r\nCouncil sent down to the Lower House an Address embodying certain\r\nresolutions against the proposed union. The Address was accompanied by a\r\nrequest that the Assembly would concur therein, after which it was to be\r\ndespatched to the King. It reached the hands of the Clerk of the Lower\r\nHouse about noon, and was at once submitted in the form of a motion of\r\nconcurrence. This was not relished by the Reformers, who were strongly\r\ndisposed in favour of an equitable union of the two Provinces, a step\r\nwhich, as they believed, would go far to adjust the balance of parties.\r\nA considerable number of the members had already left for their homes,\r\nand Dr. Rolph took advantage of this circumstance as a plea for\r\npostponing the further consideration of the matter until the next\r\nsession. He moved an amendment to that effect, and said a few words in\r\nsupport of his motion. Dr. Morrison and Thomas Parke[266] took up the\r\nargument, and spoke for some minutes. They were subjected to frequent\r\ninterruptions from the supporters of the Government, who were evidently\r\nanxious to prevent discussion. Dr. Rolph then rose to speak to the\r\nquestion of order, upon which the interruptions were renewed. Frequent\r\nappeals were made to the Speaker, who soon found himself involved in an\r\nanimated discussion with Dr. Rolph. Nearly all the prominent members of\r\nthe House erelong became participants, and the situation became\r\ncritical. Hard words were freely bandied about, amid the greatest\r\nconfusion and disorder. An eye-witness compares the scene to a wasp's\r\nnest disturbed.[267] The Speaker finally put a stop to the ebullitions\r\nof temper, and brought the scene to a close by announcing that the time\r\nhad arrived for waiting on the Lieutenant-Governor with certain\r\naddresses. There was no opportunity of renewing the discussion, and at\r\nhalf-past three o'clock Black Rod summoned the House to the bar of the\r\nLegislative Council. In proroguing Parliament the Lieutenant-Governor\r\nreferred in complacent terms to the legislation of the session, and\r\napplauded the harmony which had prevailed between the two branches of\r\nthe Legislature.\r\n\r\nBy this time it began to be apparent to discerning persons that Sir\r\nFrancis's success as an Administrator had been rather apparent than\r\nreal. All through the election campaign, as well as for some time before\r\nand after, the Tory party had sounded his praises with stentorian lungs.\r\nHe had to a large extent been accepted by the country at their\r\nvaluation. But sufficient time had now elapsed to enable the people to\r\njudge for themselves, and it was shrewdly suspected that the current\r\nestimate of him had been too high. He had triumphed at the elections,\r\nand had managed to pack the Assembly with an overwhelming majority of\r\nmembers pledged to support his policy; but he now began to discover that\r\nhe had raised a spirit which he could not control. Neither the majority\r\nin the Assembly nor the members of the Legislative Council were prepared\r\nto slavishly accept his dictation, or to follow him blindfold\r\nwhithersoever he might choose to lead them. Some of the official\r\nutterances of these bodies during the session had been as strongly\r\nassertive of their own dignity and independence as the deliverances of\r\nthe former Assembly had ever been. Even the Executive Council had begun\r\nto exhibit an impatience of being indirectly dictated to by unsworn\r\nadvisers who were permitted by the Lieutenant-Governor to usurp the\r\nfunctions peculiarly belonging to themselves. His Excellency's\r\npopularity was evidently waning throughout the land. There was a decided\r\nreaction against him, and thousands of Reformers who had voted for\r\nGovernment candidates at the election were now animated by a strong\r\nsentiment of opposition. The Lieutenant-Governor was also at issue with\r\nthe Colonial Office on several matters of importance. To the\r\nrecommendations of the Lower Canada Commissioners, as previously\r\nmentioned, he had strenuously opposed himself. He had failed to carry\r\nout the direction of Lord Glenelg to restore Mr. Ridout to the offices\r\nfrom which that gentleman had been dismissed. He now displayed further\r\ninsubordination by neglecting to obey several minor injunctions received\r\nfrom headquarters, by which course of procedure he involved himself in\r\nmuch disputatious correspondence. His anxieties were increased by a\r\ncommercial crisis which set in about this time in the United States.\r\nThere had been an era of seeming prosperity but real inflation in that\r\nfavoured land, of which the present crisis was the legitimate\r\nconsequence. Specie payments were suspended, and business was all but\r\nparalyzed. This disheartening state of things was speedily reflected in\r\nCanada, which was ill qualified to bear such an infliction. The banks\r\nand the mercantile community generally became alarmed. In the Lower\r\nProvince the banks suspended specie payments, and our own were much\r\ndisposed to follow the example. The directors of some of our leading\r\nfinancial institutions applied to the Lieutenant-Governor for advice and\r\ndirection. As all these matters, however, belong rather to the\r\nmercantile history of the country than to the story of the Rebellion,\r\nthere is no need to go into them with minuteness. Suffice it to say that\r\nSir Francis Head deemed it proper in this emergency to convene an extra\r\nsession of the Legislature, which met accordingly on Monday, the 19th of\r\nJune. As Mr. McLean had accepted a seat on the bench since the close of\r\nthe preceding session, it was necessary that a new Speaker should be\r\nelected, and A. N. MacNab was chosen as his successor.[268] The session\r\nlasted only three weeks, and terminated on Tuesday, the 11th of July. It\r\nwas purely a session of emergency, and the legislation was confined to\r\nrelieving the banks from certain penalties which the crisis had\r\nthreatened to impose upon them.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[262] See despatch of 30th December, 1836, in _Narrative_, chap. vii.\r\n\r\n[263] Mr. Charles Lindsey, in his pamphlet on \"_The Clergy Reserves:\r\ntheir History and Present Position_;\" appendix, p. i. He adds: \"The\r\nclear, pointed, classical diction of the speaker; the learning and\r\nhistorical research he displayed; the beauty and appositeness of his\r\nillustrations; the breadth and depth and immovable basis of his\r\narguments; the clearness, the syllogistic accuracy and force of his\r\nlogic, and the impressive eloquence of his delivery produced an effect\r\nupon those who heard the speech never to be forgotten. Its publication\r\nin the newspapers of the day aroused the people. It convinced them (for,\r\nstrange as it may seem now, there were many who needed to be convinced)\r\nof the unscriptural, immoral and unjust character of a State religion;\r\nwhile it confirmed them in their determination to rest not until they\r\nhad exterminated the curse from Canadian soil.... This noble effort of\r\nan able, learned, bold and patriotic defender of the cause of the people\r\nagainst their corrupt, unscrupulous and then powerful enemies, ought to\r\nbe printed in letters of gold, and preserved for the instruction and\r\nwarning of all future generations of Canadian freemen.\" This was written\r\nin 1851, when the Clergy Reserves question yet remained unsettled, and\r\nwhile it still continued to agitate the public mind almost to the\r\nexclusion of other matters. Now that the subject has ceased to be a\r\npractical one, the encomiums so lavishly bestowed upon Dr. Rolph's\r\nfamous speech will perhaps seem a little over-strained; but it was most\r\nunquestionably a great oratorical and intellectual effort, such as had\r\nnever before been heard within the walls of the Provincial Legislature.\r\nEven at this distance of time, when all interest in the subject has died\r\nout, the speech cannot be read without arousing a feeling of admiration\r\nfor the orator.\r\n\r\n[264] _Ante_, p. 330.\r\n\r\n[265] Lindsey's _Life of Mackenzie_, vol. i., p. 392.\r\n\r\n[266] Member for Middlesex.\r\n\r\n[267] See the report in the number of _The Correspondent and Advocate_\r\nfor Wednesday, March 15th.\r\n\r\n[268] Forty-two members were present at the vote on the Speakership, all\r\nof whom voted for Mr. McNab with the exception of David Gibson, of the\r\nFirst Riding of York, who recorded his solitary vote in the negative.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE FORGING OF THE PIKES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that, during the summer of 1836, Dr. Baldwin,\r\nGeorge Ridout and J. E. Small had been dismissed by Sir Francis Head\r\nfrom certain offices held by them at the pleasure of the Crown. Mr.\r\nRidout had appealed to Lord Glenelg, to whom the Lieutenant-Governor had\r\nsoon afterwards found himself called upon to defend his conduct. The\r\nonly reason which had at first been assigned by his Excellency for Mr.\r\nRidout's dismissal was that the latter was presumed to be a member of\r\nthe Constitutional Reform Society. This society, just before the\r\nelection, had issued and circulated a printed address wherein his\r\nExcellency was charged with a disregard of constitutional Government,\r\nand of candour and truth in his statements. Mr. Ridout had undoubtedly\r\nattended and spoken at some of the meetings of the society, but he was\r\nnot a member of it, and had no difficulty in establishing the fact to\r\nthe satisfaction of the Colonial Secretary, who, after mature\r\nconsideration, conveyed to Sir Francis His Majesty's commands that Mr.\r\nRidout should be reinstated in the various offices from which he had\r\nbeen removed. With this command, as mentioned towards the close of the\r\nlast chapter, Sir Francis did not see fit to comply. Finding himself\r\nbeaten upon the case as it stood, he proceeded to amend the record by\r\nalleging other matters against the accused. In this course he met with\r\nlittle encouragement from his Lordship, who patiently combated his\r\nuntenable positions, and repeated the injunction that Mr. Ridout should\r\nbe reinstated. While the matter was in abeyance, another difference of\r\nopinion arose between Lord Glenelg and Sir Francis. During the spring of\r\n1837, Mr. Jameson having been appointed Vice Chancellor, and Archibald\r\nMcLean and Jonas Jonas having been appointed Judges of the Court of\r\nKing's Bench, it became necessary for Sir Francis to submit these\r\nappointments to his Lordship, together with those of Mr. Hagerman and\r\nMr. Draper respectively to the offices of Attorney-General and\r\nSolicitor-General. His Excellency seems to have felt that it was\r\nnecessary to assign some reason for passing over Mr. Bidwell, whose\r\nlegal acquirements were certainly superior to those of any other member\r\nof the Upper Canada bar since John Rolph had abandoned the long robe.\r\n\"That gentleman's legal acquirements,\" wrote Sir Francis,[269] \"are, I\r\nconsider, superior to at least one of the individuals whom I have\r\nelevated. His moral character is irreproachable. But, anxious as I am to\r\ngive to talent its due, yet I cannot but feel that the welfare and\r\nhonour of this Province depend on His Majesty never promoting a disloyal\r\nman.\" His Excellency then went on to represent Mr. Bidwell as having\r\nbeen desirous of effecting the separation of the colony from the parent\r\nstate, and of exchanging the British constitution for \"the low,\r\ngrovelling principles of democracy.\" There was no allegation that any\r\nsuch desire had ever been personally expressed or manifested by Mr.\r\nBidwell, but it was inferred _from the conduct of his associates_. This\r\nwas somewhat more than the Colonial Secretary could quietly pass over.\r\nHe pointed out[270] to the Lieutenant-Governor that the disloyalty\r\nimputed to Mr. Bidwell's associates had not been charged against\r\nhimself, or attempted to be proved by any act of his; that he had\r\nwithdrawn himself from political strife; and that as his professional\r\nabilities and high moral character were respected by his political\r\nopponents, the political stand formerly taken by him ought not to\r\noperate against his advancement. It was further urged by his Lordship\r\nthat the elevation of such a man to the bench would convince the Upper\r\nCanadian public of the impartiality of the Executive in such matters.\r\nFinally, his Excellency was informed that should another vacancy occur\r\namong the Judges of the Court of King's Bench, it was the wish of His\r\nMajesty's Government that the situation should be offered to Mr.\r\nBidwell.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of the missive containing this intimation the Tried\r\nReformer was almost beside himself. He had none of that magnanimity\r\nwhich impels a man to admit that he is in the wrong when he has been\r\nclearly proved to be so. Nor could he boast of that skill of graceful\r\nconcession which enables its possessor to recede without discredit from\r\nan untenable position. He replied to his Lordship[271] in the following\r\nblunt and explicit terms: \"After very deliberate consideration, I have\r\ndetermined to take upon myself the serious responsibility of positively\r\nrefusing to place Mr. Bidwell on the bench, or to restore Mr. George\r\nRidout to the Judgeship from which I have removed him.\" He went on to\r\ndeprecate the necessity for this \"overt act of hostility,\" but added\r\nthat disobedience on the part of a Lieutenant-Governor does not\r\nnecessarily imply disaffection to the Minister. He hinted that he was\r\nquite prepared for an immediate dismissal. A great part of the despatch\r\nwas taken up with libels upon Mr. Bidwell and his father. In order that\r\nthere might be no misunderstanding on the matter, he emphatically\r\nrepeated his refusal to elevate the former. \"So long as I remain\r\nLieutenant-Governor of this Province,\" he wrote, \"I will _never_ raise\r\nMr. Bidwell to the bench; and I think it proper to confess to your\r\nLordship that I have at this moment two appointments to make of King's\r\nCounsel, neither of which can I conscientiously bestow upon that\r\ngentleman.\" He declined to argue the question as to Mr. Ridout any\r\nfurther, and again refused in the most explicit terms to reinstate him\r\nin office. This language left the Colonial Secretary no other discretion\r\nthan to \"accept Sir Francis's resignation,\" but before this\r\ndetermination was officially conveyed to him the peace of the Province\r\nwas disturbed by the outbreak of the rebellion.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole summer of this year Mackenzie was doing his utmost to\r\nadd to the prevalent feeling of discontent against the Government. A\r\nsuperlative bitterness had possessed him ever since the elections, and\r\nthe fate of his petition had inflamed his resentment almost to madness.\r\nHe felt that he had been cheated out of his seat, and that nothing was\r\nto be hoped for on behalf of either himself or his fellow-workers so\r\nlong as the existing Government remained in power. To subvert that\r\nGovernment thenceforth became the dominant passion of his life. He was\r\nready to adopt any means, lawful or unlawful, to secure that end. The\r\ntone of the _Constitution_ was not to be mistaken. The mind of the\r\neditor had evidently run a long course since he had first begun to\r\nconcern himself with public affairs. In one of the early numbers of the\r\n_Advocate_[272] he had boasted that disloyalty could never enter his\r\nbreast. \"Even the name I bear,\" he had written, \"has in all ages proved\r\ntalismanic, an insurmountable barrier.\" What a change had come over him\r\nsince giving utterance to those words. He now boasted of his \"rebel\r\nblood,\" which he declared would always be uppermost. \"I am proud,\" he\r\nwrote, \"of my descent from a rebel race.\"[273] And, as if this were not\r\nsufficiently specific, he added: \"If the people felt as I feel, there is\r\nnever a Grant or Glenelg who crossed the Tay and Tweed to exchange\r\nhigh-born Highland poverty for substantial Lowland wealth, who would\r\ndare to insult Upper Canada with the official presence, as its ruler, of\r\nsuch an equivocal character as this Mr. What-do-they-call-him--Francis\r\nBond Head.\" Ever and anon the Tory press retorted on him in a spirit by\r\nno means calculated to soften the asperity of his heart. The most\r\ncontemptuous epithets were freely bestowed upon him, and he was from\r\ntime to time taunted with his humble origin. It seems almost unnecessary\r\nto say that those who indulged in such taunts as these had very little\r\nwherewith to reproach Mackenzie on the score of birth and breeding.\r\nThere must surely be some foul taint in the blood of any man who can\r\nstoop to such methods of humiliating a beaten enemy. Still, such\r\ninsults, coming, as they did, in the wake of serious material injury,\r\nadded fuel to the flame which burned within Mackenzie's heart like a\r\nconsuming fire. All the worst part of his nature was up in arms. There\r\nwere times when he wrote and spoke like one who has lost all\r\nself-control. But he was in such deadly earnest that he carried\r\nconviction to many a wavering mind. In the Home District, where his\r\npaper chiefly circulated, there were scores of people who had seen\r\nenough of irresponsible Government to be ready to receive his\r\npreachments with favour. His efforts were not restricted to writing\r\nvirulent articles. He openly went among the people, and disseminated\r\nhis doctrines by word of mouth. He spoke better than he wrote; and it\r\nwas only natural that he should exercise a strong influence over the\r\nrural communities wherein the Radical element was in the ascendant. His\r\ninfluence became specially conspicuous at this time throughout the\r\nSecond Riding of York, which he had represented in Parliament, and\r\nwhich, as previously mentioned, had been the scene of much high-handed\r\ncorruption during the last election contest. The voters of that\r\nconstituency awoke to the fact that they had been beguiled by the\r\nTories, and that their representative, Mr. Thomson, was not likely to be\r\nof much service in the role of a Reformer. They eagerly listened to\r\nMackenzie's tabulation of grievances, and cheered him to the echo when\r\nhe hinted that the time had arrived for the Spirit of Freedom to assert\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nAmong those who warmly sympathized with Mackenzie was Samuel Lount, of\r\nHolland Landing, who, it will be remembered, had sat in the last\r\nParliament for Simcoe, and who had been beaten, as he believed, by\r\ncorrupt methods, at the last election. He had contemplated a petition to\r\nthe Assembly, but had been discouraged by the conviction that it would\r\nbe impossible to obtain an impartial inquiry. He now made common cause\r\nwith Mackenzie in promoting the establishment of a series of \"Union\r\nmeetings,\" as they were called, in the various townships of North York\r\nand Simcoe. These meetings were convened at irregular intervals for the\r\nostensible purpose of political organization. At first they seem to have\r\nbeen conducted with a good deal of craftiness, for as a general thing\r\nnothing was said which could in strictness be regarded as treasonable.\r\nBut there can be little doubt that the intention of the original\r\npromoter of these assemblages was the spread of revolutionary ideas,\r\nwith a view to an ultimate resort to arms, and in a short time the mask\r\nof political organization was completely thrown off. Those who had once\r\nput their hands to the plough did not care to draw back, and, before\r\nthey were aware of what they were doing, they found themselves committed\r\nto projects of which at the outset they had not so much as dreamed.\r\n\r\nLount's example was followed by most of the leading Radicals among the\r\nfarming community where he was best known. The Lloyds, Gorhams, Doans,\r\nFletchers and others had long been active advocates of Radical\r\nprinciples, and had marked with ever-growing hostility the tactics of\r\nSir Francis Head. They saw right persistently violated by might. They\r\nsaw the respectful complaints and petitions of the people disregarded\r\nand set at naught. They saw the Government in the hands of persons who\r\nwere not only devoid of sympathy with progressive ideas, but who seemed\r\nto have no regard for the principles of plain right and wrong. They\r\nfound themselves of no account in the commonwealth. Their cherished\r\nprinciples were held up to public scorn, and their chosen candidates for\r\nParliament were beaten by fraudulent means. They were utterly without\r\nweight in public affairs. After a long and hard fight with the Family\r\nCompact, they saw that clique more strongly entrenched in power than\r\never before. The Tried Reformer who, in response to their long and loud\r\nappeals, had been sent over to administer the Government, had stooped to\r\na barefaced violence and tyranny in excess of anything which could be\r\ntruly charged against the Tory Sir John Colborne. All the old abuses\r\nwere maintained in full vigour. The incubus of the Clergy Reserves was\r\nnot removed. Appointments to office were still made from one political\r\nbody only. The Legislative Council still had the power to paralyze the\r\nefforts of the Assembly. The Assembly itself was at present as\r\nretrograde as the Upper House, and it had been formed by a corrupt and\r\nvenal race of officials against whom there was no remedy. The Act to\r\nprevent the dissolution of Parliament would probably have the effect of\r\nmaintaining the existing Assembly for years. To all these evils was now\r\nsuperadded great commercial depression. And there seemed to be no\r\nprospect of brighter times. The future seemed overcast and hopeless. Is\r\nit any wonder if those who were compelled to contemplate the picture\r\nfrom this dark point of view were forced to the conclusion that a change\r\nof any kind must surely be for the better?\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say at what precise date the idea of armed\r\nresistance to authority was adopted among the rural Reformers, but I can\r\nfind no distinct trace of it until the 30th of June, when, at a secret\r\nmeeting held at Lloydtown, a resolution was passed to the effect that\r\nconstitutional resistance to oppression having been for many years tried\r\nin vain, it behooved every Reformer to arm himself in defence of his\r\nrights and those of his fellow-countrymen. Within a fortnight afterwards\r\nresolutions of a similar character were passed by small gatherings in\r\nother parts of the Home District. As yet, however, the idea of actual\r\nrebellion does not seem to have taken definite shape in the minds of the\r\nsupporters of Mackenzie and Lount. At most, there appears to have been a\r\nsort of understanding that recourse to arms was justifiable, and might\r\nsome day become expedient; but even this view of the case did not meet\r\nwith universal acquiescence, and the advocates of insurrection sometimes\r\nfound themselves confronted by hostile majorities, even among assemblies\r\nof the most trusted Radicals.\r\n\r\nBut meanwhile Reformers in the cities and towns were beginning to bestir\r\nthemselves. Toronto was the headquarters of the Reform party of Upper\r\nCanada, and it was natural that the adherents of that party throughout\r\nthe Province generally should contemplate their proceedings with\r\ninterest. As yet the idea of an armed rising against the Government had\r\nnot been seriously hinted at among the Reformers of the capital.\r\nProfound sympathy, however, was felt and expressed among them for the\r\nLower Canadians, who made no secret of their determination to rebel in\r\ncase certain resolutions adopted by the British Parliament, at the\r\ninstance of the Ministry, were acted upon. These resolutions had been\r\nadopted in consequence of the Lower Canadian Assembly's persistent\r\nrefusal to grant supplies. They authorized the seizure of certain funds\r\nin the hands of the Provincial Receiver-General, and the application of\r\nthem to the general purposes of the Provincial government. Papineau and\r\nhis adherents had been maddened by this proceeding, and were actively\r\nengaged in preparations for an outbreak. The Upper Canadian Reformers\r\nwarmly sympathized with their neighbours, and passed resolutions\r\ncondemnatory of the obnoxious resolutions. On the 5th of July,\r\nMackenzie, in the _Constitution_, reviewed the state of affairs in the\r\nLower Province with exceeding boldness. He discussed the probability of\r\nan outbreak there, and the chances of success, very clearly indicating\r\nhis own opinion in the affirmative as to both contingencies. Other\r\nReform papers expressed strong opinions in favour of Papineau's side of\r\nthe quarrel, but, with the exception of the _Constitution_, none of them\r\nventured to predict and hope for the success of the rebel arms. The fact\r\nis, that a comparatively small number of Upper Canadian Reformers were\r\neither ripe for or desirous of rebellion. They were aroused to hot\r\nanger, and were prepared to advocate the most radical measures of\r\nagitation. Their hostility, however, was not chiefly directed against\r\nGreat Britain, but against Sir Francis Head and those by whom he was\r\nsurrounded. It was felt that the Home Office had failed in its duty, but\r\nthe more intelligent were ready to make allowances for the ignorance\r\nrespecting Canadian affairs of a Minister three thousand miles away.\r\nSuch were the sentiments of Robert Baldwin and hundreds of other persons\r\nthe sincerity of whose Reform principles were equally free from doubt.\r\nDr. Baldwin felt and expressed less moderation than his son, though he\r\nwas not the man to venture upon what he could not have regarded\r\notherwise than as a hare-brained scheme of rebellion, more especially\r\nwhen his chief allies would be composed of the Mackenzie element of\r\nRadicals. Rolph and Bidwell were precisely of the same opinion as Dr.\r\nBaldwin. They were sick and weary of all that they saw around them. They\r\nwould have cordially welcomed a bloodless revolution. As for Bidwell, he\r\nwould gladly have seen the Province quietly absorbed by the United\r\nStates, for Family Compact domination would then have been at an end,\r\nand there would have been a chance for a man to be rated according to\r\nhis merits. One situated as he was could not be expected to be devotedly\r\nloyal to a Government which did its utmost to keep him down, and which\r\nraised a lawyer like Jonas Jones to the bench over his head. Like his\r\nfather before him, he was a republican in principle, and would doubtless\r\nhave been willing enough to see a republican form of Government\r\nestablished in Upper Canada; but he had never permitted his\r\npredilections to interfere with his duties as a citizen and legislator.\r\nMoreover, he was before all things a Christian and a man of peace. It is\r\nnot by such as he that revolutions are planned or accomplished. If\r\nquestioned on the subject, he would doubtless have admitted that\r\nrebellion, under certain circumstances, may be justifiable, but it is\r\nhardly possible to conceive of any circumstances under which he could\r\nhave been induced to take part in such a movement. Assuredly, nothing\r\nshort of an almost absolute certainty of success would have impelled him\r\nto such a course. The inherent probabilities of success in the case of\r\nthe Upper Canadian rebellion were from the first very few and remote.\r\nThere was a brief interval during which, owing to the stupidity and\r\nsupineness of the Government, success might have been achieved, but\r\nwhether it would have been temporary or permanent must ever remain an\r\nopen question. In any case, the contingency was one upon which no\r\nprudent man would have allowed himself to count beforehand. As a matter\r\nof fact Mr. Bidwell had no more to do with the rebellion than had Robert\r\nBaldwin.[274] Dr. Rolph, Dr. Morrison, David Gibson, James Hervey Price,\r\nFrancis Hincks, John Doel, James and William Lesslie, John\r\nMackintosh,[275] and many other leading Reformers were full of vehemence\r\nand indignation, ready to go any reasonable length to bring about a\r\nstate of things more satisfactory to their party; but up to the close of\r\nsummer I cannot learn that any serious thought of rebellion had taken\r\npossession of the minds of any prominent Toronto Reformer with the\r\nexception of Mackenzie himself. Even up in North York and Simcoe, where\r\nthe feeling of discontent was strongest, and where there was much talk\r\nabout rebellion against the Government, no one seems to have realized or\r\nbelieved that there would be any actual outbreak.\r\n\r\nThere could be no doubt, however, that the Reformers in both town and\r\ncountry were more thoroughly in earnest than they had ever been before.\r\nEnergetic measures were in favour among them, and the number of\r\nadvocates of passive endurance was very small. There were regular\r\ncommunications between them and the opponents of the Government in Lower\r\nCanada. They held frequent meetings, at which schemes of agitation were\r\ndiscussed, and where every member was encouraged to speak his mind\r\nwithout fear or favour. A very frequent place of meeting in Toronto was\r\nElliott's tavern, on the north-west corner of Yonge and Queen Streets. A\r\nplace for holding more secret and confidential caucuses was the brewery\r\nof John Doel, situated at the rear of his house on the north-west corner\r\nof Adelaide and Bay Streets.[276] Towards the end of July a number of\r\nleading Radicals assembled at Elliott's for the purpose of discussing\r\nthe draft of a written Declaration, which was intended to embody the\r\nplatform of the local members of the party. It reads very much like a\r\ncautious parody on the Declaration of Independence of the United States,\r\nupon which it was evidently modelled. It set forth the principal\r\ngrievances of which the Reform party complained; declared that the time\r\nhad arrived for the assertion of rights and the redress of wrongs; and\r\nexpressed the warmest admiration of Papineau and his compatriots for\r\ntheir opposition to the British Government. It further expressed the\r\nopinion that the Reformers of Upper Canada were bound to make common\r\ncause with their fellow-citizens in the Lower Province; and to render\r\ntheir cooeperation more effectual it recommended that public meetings\r\nshould be held and political associations organized throughout the\r\ncountry. Finally, it recommended that a convention of delegates should\r\nbe held at Toronto to consider the political situation, \"with authority\r\nto its members to appoint commissioners to meet others to be named on\r\nbehalf of Lower Canada and any of the other colonies, armed with\r\nsuitable powers as a congress to seek an effectual remedy for the\r\ngrievances of the colonists.\" Mr. Lindsey,[277] doubtless upon the\r\nauthority of Mackenzie, represents this Declaration as having been the\r\njoint work of Dr. Rolph and Dr. W. J. O'Grady, somewhile editor of _The\r\nCorrespondent and Advocate_. I can find no confirmatory evidence of\r\nthis statement, and some of Dr. Rolph's letters would seem, at least by\r\nimplication, to contradict the assertion that he had any hand in its\r\npreparation. The question of authorship, however, is not important. The\r\ndocument was discussed at considerable length. Dr. Morrison, who was\r\npresent, fully approved of its contents, but objected to sign it, as he\r\nwould thereby place himself in a dubious position as a member of\r\nParliament. This argument was not acquiesced in by James Lesslie, and\r\nthe Doctor finally appended his signature. His example was followed by\r\nall the other members present except James Lesslie, who withheld his\r\nname until the document should be signed by Dr. Rolph, who was absent\r\nfrom the meeting.[278]\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of Friday, the 28th of the same month, the Declaration\r\nwas submitted to and discussed for the second time by a number of\r\nReformers assembled at Elliott's. There was to be a large meeting the\r\nsame evening at Doel's brewery, at which it was thought desirable that\r\nthe platform should be adopted. Some discussion arose as to several\r\nclauses, however, and one or two immaterial alterations were made, after\r\nwhich it was thought best to postpone the final adoption of the\r\nDeclaration in its entirety until a subsequent meeting. The meeting held\r\nduring the evening at Doel's was very numerously attended. About three\r\nhundred persons were present,[279] and a good deal of important\r\ndiscussion took place. A motion expressive of sympathy and admiration\r\nfor Papineau and his compatriots was proposed by Mackenzie, and passed\r\nwithout a dissentient voice, and it was resolved that \"the Reformers of\r\nUpper Canada\" should make common cause with those of the Lower Province.\r\nThe persons present at this meeting of course had no authority to speak\r\non behalf of the Reformers of Upper Canada as a whole, but they fairly\r\nenough represented the Radical wing of the party, which was quite large\r\nenough to be formidable. The meeting further resolved that a convention\r\nof delegates should be assembled at an early period in Toronto, \"to take\r\ninto consideration the state of the Province, the causes of the present\r\npecuniary and other difficulties, and the means whereby they may be\r\neffectually removed;\" and that persons be appointed by the said\r\nconvention to proceed to Lower Canada, \"there to meet the delegates of\r\nany congress of these Provinces which may be appointed to sit and\r\ndeliberate on matters of mutual interest to the colonies during the\r\npresent year.\" The Declaration was not submitted, as final judgment had\r\nnot been passed upon it by those who had it in charge. After a long and\r\nbusy session, the assemblage adjourned to meet in the same place on the\r\nevening of Monday, the 31st.\r\n\r\nIt was matter of much regret among the Radical leaders that Dr. Rolph\r\nhad not up to this time taken any active part in their deliberations. He\r\nwas known to be in sympathy with the project of a movement in concert\r\nwith the Lower Canadians for the purpose of impressing the Imperial\r\nGovernment with the necessity of changing their colonial policy. He had\r\nbecome the trusted counsellor of all the leading Radicals, who looked up\r\nto him as the one man in the Province who was capable of directing any\r\nlarge or wise measure of Reform. But he had not identified himself with\r\nthem by actual cooeperation in their projects, and had attended none of\r\ntheir secret meetings, although he was kept fully informed of all that\r\noccurred thereat. The Radicals, recognizing how much would be gained by\r\nsecuring the presence among them of Rolph and Bidwell, resolved to press\r\nboth those gentlemen into service. At the adjourned meeting on the\r\nevening of the 31st, the movement made considerable progress. The\r\nDeclaration was formally adopted clause by clause. According to a\r\ncontemporary newspaper report,[280] it \"called forth from the meeting\r\nthe most unequivocal marks of approbation.\" As already mentioned, one of\r\nits clauses recommended the holding of a convention at Toronto. A\r\nresolution was accordingly unanimously adopted appointing Rolph,\r\nBidwell, Dr. Morrison, James Lesslie and others as delegates to the\r\nproposed convention. This, it was confidently believed, would have the\r\neffect of identifying Rolph and Bidwell with the Radical cause, for it\r\nwas not thought that either of them would refuse to attend as delegates.\r\nOther resolutions were adopted with a view to placing the party in a\r\nstate of efficient organization throughout the Province. The persons who\r\nhad previously appended their names to the Declaration[281] were\r\nappointed \"a permanent Committee of Vigilance, for this city and\r\nliberties, and to carry into immediate and practical effect the\r\nresolutions of this meeting for the effectual organization of the\r\nReformers of Upper Canada.\" John Elliott, a Toronto scrivener, who was\r\nalso Assistant Clerk of the City Council, was requested to continue to\r\nact as Secretary-in-Ordinary, and Mackenzie to act as \"Agent and\r\nCorresponding Secretary.\" Both of these requests were assented to. A\r\nresolution, doubtless adopted in emulation of similar resolutions at\r\nmeetings held under Papineau's auspices in Lower Canada, pledged the\r\nmembers to abstain as far as possible \"from the consumption of articles\r\ncoming from beyond sea, or paying duties.\" A sort of rider to this was\r\nmoved by Mackenzie, and adopted by the meeting: \"That the right of\r\nobtaining articles of luxury or necessity in the cheapest market is\r\ninherent in the people, who only consent to the imposition of duties for\r\nthe creation of revenues with the express understanding that the\r\nrevenues so raised from them shall be devoted to the necessary expenses\r\nof Government, and appointed by the people's representatives; and\r\ntherefore, when the contract is broken by an Executive or any foreign\r\nauthority, the people are released from their engagement, and are no\r\nlonger under any moral obligation to contribute to or aid in the\r\ncollection of such revenues.\" On Wednesday, the 2nd of August, the\r\nDeclaration was published in full, together with the names of the\r\ncommittee, in _The Correspondent and Advocate_, and in Mackenzie's\r\n_Constitution_. Each of these papers also published a report of the\r\nproceedings at the meeting.\r\n\r\nThe part assigned to Mackenzie--that of \"Agent and Corresponding\r\nSecretary\"--was an important one, and involved him in the necessity of\r\ngiving up all his time and energies to the cause. In so far as his\r\nabilities enabled him to do so, he was to virtually play the same part\r\nin Upper Canada that had long been enacted by Papineau in the Lower\r\nProvince. He was to be a supreme itinerant organizer, and was to go\r\nabout the country stirring up opposition to the Government. This would\r\ninvolve the arranging and holding of public meetings and secret\r\ncaucuses, the selection of local correspondents, the supervision of\r\nlocal reports, and various other duties not definitely specified, much\r\nbeing necessarily left to his own discretion. He had been engaged in\r\nprecisely similar tasks for some weeks previously, but henceforth he was\r\nable to carry out his designs as the accredited emissary of the\r\nReformers of Toronto, a fact which of course gave him additional\r\nimportance in the eyes of the Reformers generally. His appointment was\r\ndue to his own manoeuvres, but it must be confessed that he was in\r\nmany respects well qualified for the post.\r\n\r\nHe addressed himself to his tasks with redoubled assiduity. The Province\r\nwas mapped out into four districts, each of which was again subdivided\r\ninto minor divisions. Local branch societies were formed or remodelled\r\nin all neighbourhoods where Reformers were numerous. Each of these was\r\ndirected to report regularly to a central society, and all the latter\r\nwere to report to the Corresponding Secretary, by whom the reports were\r\nclassified, digested, and laid before the central committee in Toronto.\r\nMackenzie at once proceeded to hold a fresh series of meetings,\r\nbeginning with the townships in which he was best known, and thence\r\nflitting hither and thither as was deemed advisable. In this way, in the\r\ncourse of the late summer and autumn he went over the whole of the Home\r\nDistrict, and over a great part of the adjoining country. His soul was\r\nin the work he was doing, and he put into it all the energy which he\r\ncould command. He did not succeed in arousing such a feeling in the west\r\nas Papineau did in the east. He had not Papineau's marvellous Gallic\r\neloquence, nor were the farmers of Upper Canada composed of such\r\ninflammable material as the _habitans_ of the Lower Province. But\r\nMackenzie, when thoroughly aroused, as he now was, had considerable\r\npower to move the masses, and he exerted himself to this end as he had\r\nnever done before. The manifold wrongs he had endured had exasperated\r\nhis nature almost beyond endurance, and he could lash himself into a\r\nstorm of indignation at a moment's notice. He succeeded in awakening\r\nenthusiasm in persons who had formerly been remarkable for stolidity.\r\nHe presented few new subjects for the consideration of his auditors, but\r\nhe presented old subjects in a light which was suggestive of new ideas.\r\nHe declaimed against the iniquities of the Executive, the supineness of\r\nthe Imperial Government, and the culpable indifference of the British\r\nParliament. The Declaration, in fact, was the test upon which his\r\nharangues were founded, but he presented its respective clauses in\r\never-recurring novelty of aspect. The document was itself submitted to\r\nthe various meetings for approval, accompanied by Mackenzie's fiery\r\ncommentary. As a general thing the Radical element was largely in the\r\nascendant at the gatherings, and he had no trouble about carrying his\r\nresolutions, frequently by very large majorities. He adapted his oratory\r\nto his audience. Where he knew that he would encounter little or no\r\nopposition he was much more outspoken than where the feeling was less\r\nfavourable to him. Wherever he felt that he could carry his audience\r\nwith him, he boldly advocated separation from the mother-country, and\r\nthe establishment of elective institutions under an independent\r\nGovernment; though he took care to deprecate any appeal to physical\r\nforce,[282] and generally advocated a money payment to the British\r\nGovernment as the price of a full release and quittance of all Imperial\r\nclaims upon the colony. He employed all the paraphernalia which he\r\nthought likely to impress the people, and banners bearing revolutionary\r\ninscriptions were freely displayed from the platform in neighbourhoods\r\nwhere such a course was deemed safe. Lount, Gibson, Nelson Gorham and\r\nothers occasionally reinforced him by their presence and their oratory.\r\nThese gentlemen were all gifted with more than ordinary powers of\r\nexpression. The subject-matter was one which they all had deeply at\r\nheart, and upon which they could speak with never-failing freshness and\r\nvigour. The audiences were sometimes moved to rapturous demonstrations\r\nof applause. Even in communities where the popular sentiment was less\r\nenthusiastic the recommendations embodied in the Declaration were\r\ngenerally assented to, and local vigilance committees were formed.\r\nDelegates to the proposed Toronto convention were appointed, but the\r\ndate of holding it was for the time left open. About seventy of these\r\ndelegates were appointed in the Home District alone. The necessity for\r\nmaking common cause with the Lower Canadian Opposition in their efforts\r\nto establish civil and religious liberty was vehemently pressed by the\r\nspeakers, and commonly recognized by the audiences. Any reference on the\r\npart of the speakers to what \"our brethren in Lower Canada\" were doing\r\nfor the cause of liberty was almost certain to evoke applause. A trusted\r\nemissary--Jesse Lloyd of Lloydtown--acted as a medium of communication\r\nbetween the Radical leaders in the two Provinces, and passed to and fro\r\nfrom time to time with despatches and intelligence between Papineau and\r\nMackenzie. By this and other means the Lower Canadian leaders were from\r\nfirst to last kept promptly informed of the progress of the movement in\r\nthe Upper Province.\r\n\r\nSometimes--not often--Mackenzie met with considerable opposition. The\r\nidea of separation from Great Britain was a stumbling-block to a few\r\neven of the ultra-Radicals, and had to be handled with extreme delicacy.\r\nOthers were chary of any concerted action with the Lower Canadians on\r\naccount of the latter's religious faith. In several instances, moreover,\r\nthe meetings were actually broken up by the Tories, in whose ears the\r\nlanguage used by Mackenzie and his coadjutors was neither more nor less\r\nthan treason. In other instances, though the opposition was not\r\neffective enough to actually break up the meetings, it was found\r\nimpossible to carry any resolutions founded upon the Declaration. In\r\ntwo cases the meetings were broken up in confusion by local bodies of\r\nOrangemen, and a number of persons sustained more or less physical\r\nviolence. Such incidents as these, however, were the exception, and not\r\nthe rule. Out of all the meetings--considerably more than a hundred in\r\nnumber[283]--held between the adoption of the Declaration and the actual\r\noutbreak of rebellion, seventy-five per cent seem to have passed off\r\nwithout serious disturbance or interference. Most of those who\r\ndisapproved of the meetings staid away from them, and regarded those who\r\npromoted them with settled hostility, frequently accompanied by\r\ncontempt. Of those who attended and supported the resolutions, a very\r\nsmall number had any suspicion that matters were shaping themselves, or\r\nwere being shaped by Mackenzie, towards rebellion.\r\n\r\nAs for Mackenzie himself, he seems to have been intent on mischief\r\nduring the whole summer of this eventful year. He however recognized the\r\nnecessity of moving slowly, for no one knew better than he that a very\r\nsmall percentage of the Reformers of the Province could be brought to\r\nsanction such a project as rebellion under his auspices. What they might\r\nhave been disposed to do if rebellion had been mooted by Robert Baldwin,\r\nBidwell, Rolph, and other eminent Reformers, it would now be idle to\r\ninquire. It would be as profitless as to discuss what would have been\r\nthe fate of the Revolution of 1688 if James the Second had died while he\r\nwas Duke of York. The mental constitution of Baldwin and Bidwell were\r\nsuch that it would have been an impossibility for them to take part in a\r\nrebellion, and the general belief with respect to Rolph was that his\r\ndoing so was equally out of the question. All this was well known to\r\nMackenzie. He also well knew that the Reform press would have promptly\r\ndenounced him had his designs been known. If he had encountered such\r\ndenunciation his bubble would have burst there and then. But the Reform\r\npress knew nothing of his designs. He was believed to be agitating for\r\nconstitutional Reform. It was of course known that he was carrying his\r\nagitation to an unprecedented length, but it was supposed that he was\r\ndoing so for the purpose of intimidating the Government, and thereby\r\ncoercing them into concessions; and the Reform press throughout the land\r\nwas fully prepared to support him in such a course. He accordingly acted\r\nwith much greater caution than he had been wont to display in the\r\nmanagement of either public or private affairs. He perceived that the\r\nmachinery of vigilance committees, branch societies, public meetings and\r\nwhat not, which had been so successfully set in motion under the\r\nauspices of the Reformers, might be turned to account for\r\ninsurrectionary purposes. To a few of his friends in the country, over\r\nwhom he possessed almost unbounded influence, and who, as he knew, felt\r\nalmost as bitterly towards the Government as he himself did, he imparted\r\na project involving a resort to arms. Among them were Samuel Lount,\r\nJesse Lloyd, Silas Fletcher, Nelson Gorham and Peter Matthews. The\r\ncommunication was doubtless made to the several persons at different\r\ntimes, but all of those mentioned seem to have been made acquainted with\r\nthe project before the beginning of autumn. They all yielded a ready\r\nenough acquiescence, but no thought of bloodshed was in their minds. It\r\nwas intended to get together a great body of Reformers from all over the\r\ncountry, and then to advance upon the capital in the form of a monster\r\ndemonstration. This idea seems to have originated with Lount. It was at\r\nfirst objected to by Mackenzie as unlikely to prove efficacious. He\r\nurged that demonstrations had been made in his favour several years\r\nbefore, and that none of them had had any effect in moderating the\r\npolicy of the Government, or in inducing the Assembly to permit him to\r\nsit therein. He especially instanced the occasion upon which a great\r\ncrowd of the York electors had accompanied him to the House of Assembly,\r\nand had filled the galleries and lobbies while Parliament was\r\nsitting.[284] All this, he pointed out, had been labour in vain, and if\r\nsuch a scene were to be re-enacted it must, in order to produce any\r\nsatisfactory effect, be on a very large scale indeed. His argument was\r\nunanswerable. It was clear that any appeal to the Government's sense of\r\nright would be made in vain, and that they could only be influenced\r\nthrough their fears. If anything was to be effected by means of a\r\ndemonstration, the number of persons taking part in it must be\r\nsufficiently numerous to overawe, and if necessary to coerce, the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nSome weeks appear to have elapsed before any scheme was definitely fixed\r\nupon and approved by all the nine or ten persons concerned, who thus\r\ntook upon themselves the responsibility of directing the future course\r\nof our colonial polity. The understanding arrived at was that the time\r\nof holding the proposed convention in Toronto would also be the\r\nappropriate time for making the proposed demonstration. The convention\r\nwould afford a reasonable pretext for the assembling of great numbers of\r\nReformers at the capital. It will be remembered that no definite time\r\nhad been fixed upon for the holding of the convention. It was now\r\nsettled that it should be held early in the spring of the year 1838.\r\nWhen the gathering should be complete, it was proposed to wait upon the\r\nGovernment, as the barons waited on King John at Runnymede, and wring\r\nfrom them their assent to a constitution founded upon the propositions\r\nembodied in the Declaration. It was agreed that if this assent should be\r\nobtained, Sir Francis Head was, at any rate temporarily, to be left\r\nundisturbed in his position of Lieutenant-Governor, but that the\r\nExecutive Council should be altogether remodelled, and that Rolph,\r\nBidwell and Mackenzie should have seats therein. The Government was to\r\nbe carried on upon the principle of Executive responsibility to the\r\nAssembly. This re-adjustment was to be followed by a general election,\r\nafter which the future of the colony would be in the hands of the\r\nAssembly.\r\n\r\nBut how if the Government would not be coerced? What was to be done if\r\nthey refused to be dictated to? In that case there was only one course\r\nopen. The Lieutenant-Governor and his Council were to be seized with\r\n_as_ little violence as possible. A Provisional Government was to be\r\nformed with Dr. Rolph at its head, provided that that gentleman could be\r\ninduced to accept the position. It was not believed that the carrying\r\nout of this project would necessarily involve any sacrifice of life, for\r\nthe force at the disposal of the Provisional Government would be such as\r\nto render any opposition futile. Moreover, the bulk of the population of\r\nthe capital were known to be favourable to Reform principles, and it was\r\nbelieved that they would readily take part in the movement if they saw\r\nan assured prospect of success.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators were sanguine as to obtaining Rolph's cooeperation, for,\r\nunlike Bidwell, he had not repudiated the position of a member of the\r\nconvention, which had been thrust upon him by the meeting at Doel's\r\nbrewery in July. Bidwell, immediately upon becoming acquainted with what\r\nhad been done, had notified the secretary that he had withdrawn from\r\npolitical life, and that he could have nothing to do with the proposed\r\nconvention. Rolph also had at first felt disposed to decline the\r\nappointment, but he had taken time to consider, and had talked the\r\nmatter over with Dr. Baldwin, who had strongly counselled him to accept.\r\nI can find no documentary evidence of either acceptance or rejection on\r\nhis part, but he seems to have been favourable to the holding of the\r\nconvention, which he doubtless regarded as a possible means of\r\nconsolidating the Reform party, and of rendering its opposition to the\r\nGovernment more effective. It was agreed that for the present nothing\r\nshould be said to him about the contemplated subversion of the\r\nGovernment by force. The boldest features of the scheme were intended to\r\nbe kept secret from nearly everyone until the time for action should be\r\nnear at hand, but no oath of secrecy was imposed, and, in spite of all\r\nresolutions, more or less accurate hints of what was in contemplation\r\nwere conveyed to hundreds of Radicals throughout the Home District and\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nAs the autumn advanced, the conspirators proceeded to prepare their\r\nadherents for the impressive display of the ensuing spring. It was\r\nevident that even a very numerously-attended demonstration would not\r\nimpress the Government unless those taking part in it carried about with\r\nthem a suggestion of strength. In order to be strong they must have\r\narms, and they must furthermore know how to use them should the\r\nnecessity arise. A system of secret training and drill was accordingly\r\norganized throughout the townships. People met after nightfall in the\r\ncorners of quiet fields, in the shadow of the woods, and in other\r\nsequestered places, and there received such instruction in military\r\ndrill and movements as was possible under the circumstances. Old\r\nmuskets, pistols and cutlasses were furbished up after long disuse, and\r\npressed into service once more. Small quantities of rifles and\r\nammunition were surreptitiously obtained from the United States.\r\nDisaffected blacksmiths in the rural districts devoted themselves to the\r\nmanufacture of rude pike-heads, which, after being fitted to hickory\r\nhandles of five or six feet in length, formed no contemptible weapons\r\nfor either attack or defence. Lount's blacksmith shop at Holland Landing\r\nwas for some weeks largely given up to this manufacture. As there was no\r\nattempt at interference with these proceedings, the disaffected became\r\nbolder, and began to assemble at regular periods to engage in rifle\r\npractice, pigeon-matches, and the slaughter of turkeys. As intimated in\r\na previous note,[285] Mr. Bidwell was applied to for a legal opinion as\r\nto the lawfulness of such gatherings. He advised with great caution,\r\nspecifying how far he conceived this sort of thing might be carried with\r\nimpunity. Gatherings for the slaughter of birds and for trials of skill\r\nwith the rifle he conceived to be clearly within the law.\r\n\r\nBefore the middle of October the movement had extended in all\r\ndirections. The four districts into which the Province had been mapped\r\nout were called respectively the Toronto Division, the Midland Division,\r\nthe Western Division and the Eastern Division. The first-named consisted\r\nof the counties of York, Simcoe, Durham, Halton, Wentworth, Haldimand\r\nand Lincoln. The second included the counties of Northumberland,\r\nHastings, Prince Edward, Frontenac, Lennox and Addington. The Western\r\nDivision consisted of Oxford, Norfolk, Middlesex, Huron, Kent and Essex;\r\nand the Eastern included all that portion of the Province to the east\r\nand north-east of the Midland. Preparations for the demonstration were\r\nmore or less active everywhere, and there were nights when the whole\r\ncountry side might be said to be in arms. In some portions of the\r\nWestern Division, which was under the direction of Dr. Charles Duncombe,\r\nthe feeling against the Government was as intense as in any part of the\r\nHome District, and the preparations there were carried on with special\r\nactivity. Dr. Duncombe and a few leading personages among the Radicals\r\nwere entrusted with the full plan of the conspiracy, so far as it had\r\nbeen matured; but in no part of the Province were the rank and file\r\ntaken into anything like full confidence. Most of those who engaged in\r\ndrill, and in the manufacture of pike-heads and handles, supposed that\r\nthey were merely getting ready for a formidable procession which was to\r\nintimidate the Government by reason of its numerical strength. The\r\nenquiry may not unnaturally be made: What were the Government about all\r\nthis time? Were they in total ignorance of what was going on all around\r\nthem? Not at all. They were kept regularly informed of the banners,\r\nspeech-makings, drillings, pigeon-matches and what not; and--at least in\r\nsome instances--they contrived to obtain pretty accurate reports of the\r\nproceedings at Mackenzie's meetings. But they committed the grave error\r\nof undervaluing their opponents. They would not believe it possible that\r\nMackenzie could ever again be dangerous. He had been so completely\r\nworsted in his hand-to-hand fight with Toryism that it was not to be\r\ncredited that he would ever again be able to secure a following large\r\nenough to be worth seriously considering. True, he threatened all manner\r\nof dire calamities, but he had for so many years been accustomed to\r\nindulge in loud-mouthed threats that he had lost all power to create\r\nalarm. He was like the shepherd's boy who had cried \"wolf\" so often that\r\nnobody paid heed to him. The official party spoke of him as an upstart\r\nmannikin who had enjoyed his little day of notoriety, but whose power\r\nfor either good or ill was past and gone. Sometimes, when he published\r\nanything of special ferocity in his paper, the attention of the\r\nLieutenant-Governor would be drawn to it by his supporters, who would\r\nurge that a prosecution should be instituted. But Sir Francis's wiser\r\ncounsellors knew better than to adopt any such foolish course. They knew\r\nthat State prosecutions had done more to alienate popular sympathy and\r\nto weaken the power of the Government in times past than any other cause\r\nwhatever. The editor of the _Constitution_, they believed, had steadily\r\nlost his influence--an influence which he could never hope to regain\r\nunless some imprudent act of his enemies should once more create for him\r\na specious sympathy and notoriety. Nothing, it was felt, would be so\r\ncertain to give him a fictitious importance as to prosecute him for\r\ntreason, at least until he should proceed to such lengths as to render a\r\nprosecution imperative. Sir Francis Head, Chief Justice Robinson,\r\nAttorney-General Hagerman, Judge Jones, and the whole race of\r\nofficialdom refused to believe in the possibility of an actual\r\nrebellion. They all declared that there were not fifty men in the\r\nProvince who would consent to take arms against the Government. Plenty\r\nof low Radicals, it was said, were ready enough to boast and bluster,\r\nbut their courage was only skin-deep. As for Mackenzie, he was admitted\r\nto be an exception, so far as the mere disposition to rebel was\r\nconcerned, but he had lost any influence he had ever possessed, and\r\ncounted for nothing. It was tolerably certain that he would sooner or\r\nlater overstep the limits at which it would be possible to leave him\r\nalone. Then, when he should have placed himself in such a position that\r\nno loyal subject could defend him, would be the time to make an\r\neffectual disposition of him. By all means, then, give him an abundance\r\nof rope. This was the spirit in which the little man and his proceedings\r\nwere regarded by the authorities, and he availed himself of the freedom\r\nof speech and action to the fullest conceivable extent. \"First,\" says\r\nSir Francis,[286] \"he wrote, and then be printed, and then he rode, and\r\nthen he spoke, stamped, foamed, wiped his seditious little mouth, and\r\nthen spoke again; and thus, like a squirrel in a cage, he continued with\r\nastounding assiduity the centre of a revolutionary career.\"\r\nAttorney-General Hagerman was instructed to report to his Excellency as\r\nsoon as Mackenzie had proceeded so far in the direction of treason that\r\nhis conviction would be certain, and meanwhile he was permitted to\r\ninvoke the Spirit of Freedom, both in prose and poetry, to his heart's\r\ncontent.\r\n\r\nIn the Lower Province matters had so shaped themselves as to favour\r\nMackenzie's designs. Sir John Colborne was kept tolerably well informed\r\nas to the proceedings of Papineau and the other fomenters of revolt, and\r\nhe had become aware that he would very soon be compelled to have\r\nrecourse to the strong hand. He felt perfectly secure, but at the same\r\ntime determined to neglect no precaution which might conduce to a swift\r\nand decisive victory. He mustered all the forces at his command, and\r\nsatisfied himself, from personal supervision, as to their efficiency.\r\nThere were a few troops stationed in Toronto. Sir John shared Sir\r\nFrancis Head's confidence in the loyalty of the Upper Canadians, and\r\nacquiesced in the opinion that an Upper Canadian rebellion was\r\naltogether out of the question. As he believed that there was no\r\nlikelihood of the troops being needed there, he deemed it prudent to\r\nstrengthen his position by removing them to Kingston, where they would\r\nbe more readily available in case of his requiring their services to\r\ncrush the rebellion in Lower Canada. When this removal had been\r\neffected, Toronto was left wholly unguarded by military. By command of\r\nthe Lieutenant-Governor, several thousand stand of arms which had\r\nrecently been sent from Kingston, together with a quantity of\r\nammunition, were committed to the custody of the municipal authorities\r\nand deposited in the City Hall. Two constables were placed in charge,\r\nand this was absolutely the only precaution taken against the seizure of\r\nboth arms and ammunition by any determined body of men who might think\r\nproper to possess themselves thereof.\r\n\r\nMackenzie believed that the propitious time had arrived, and that the\r\nresolve to postpone until the following spring any active measures\r\nagainst the Government should be rescinded. He received an additional\r\nimpetus from certain messages which reached him through Jesse Lloyd, on\r\nMonday, the 9th of October, from the leaders of the movement in Lower\r\nCanada. These messages apprised him that the French Canadians were about\r\nto make what they called a \"brave stroke for liberty\" without further\r\ndelay. They entreated him to cooeperate with them by simultaneously\r\nraising the standard of revolt in the Upper Province. Lloyd himself\r\nfavoured the idea, and counselled its adoption.\r\n\r\nSuch a momentous step, however, could not very well be taken without the\r\nconcurrence of others. Mackenzie, who at the time of receiving the\r\nmessages was out on Yonge Street, some miles from Toronto, hastened into\r\ntown, and summoned a small secret caucus to meet at Doel's brewery. I am\r\nunable to fix the exact date of holding this caucus, but it must have\r\nbeen on the evening of either Monday the 9th or Tuesday the 10th of\r\nOctober.[287] Eleven persons were present. They were, 1. Mackenzie\r\nhimself; 2. John Doel, the owner of the brewery; 3. Dr. Morrison; 4.\r\nJohn Mackintosh, who sat in the Assembly for the Fourth Riding\r\nof York; 5. John Elliott, who, as already mentioned, acted as\r\nSecretary-in-Ordinary to the Reform Union meetings in Toronto; 6.\r\nTimothy Parson, who kept a straw bonnet and fancy warehouse on King\r\nStreet; 7. Robert Mackay, a grocer and wine merchant; 8. William\r\nLesslie, one of the firm of Lesslie & Sons, booksellers, stationers and\r\ndruggists, at number 110-1/2 King Street; 9. John Armstrong, a\r\nmanufacturer of edged tools, having a place of business at number 33\r\nYonge Street; 10. Thomas Armstrong, a carpenter, residing at number 11\r\nLot (now Queen) Street; 11. John Mills, hatter, 191 King Street. Dr.\r\nRolph and J. H. Price had been asked to attend, but they did not see fit\r\nto do so. No one except Mackenzie appears to have had any idea of the\r\nreal object for which the meeting had been summoned. The other ten\r\nmerely repaired to the appointed place to hear whatever communication\r\nthe Agent and Corresponding Secretary might have to make to them. Upon\r\nbeing called upon to state the purpose for which he had called them\r\ntogether, Mackenzie proceeded to unfold his project. He had no sooner\r\nentered upon it than he encountered murmurs and expressions of dissent.\r\nHe stated that he could count upon the active cooeperation of at least\r\nfifteen hundred men in the Home District alone, of whom, however, not\r\nmore than a third were supplied with arms. Beyond the limits of the Home\r\nDistrict he could count upon from two to three thousand, but of these\r\nnot one-fifth were properly armed. All these, he declared, might be\r\nimplicitly depended upon to support any project which might then and\r\nthere be determined upon. He proposed to send out trusty messengers in\r\nall directions to summon these \"good men and true\" to repair at once to\r\nToronto. But there was no need, he said, to wait for the arrival of\r\nthese supporters. He had taken pains to ascertain the exact condition of\r\nthe city, and it was absolutely defenceless, owing to the sending away\r\nof the troops. Why should not the decisive blow be struck at once? Why\r\nnot instantly send for Dutcher's[288] foundry-men and Armstrong's\r\naxe-makers, all of whom were true to the good cause? With these men at\r\ntheir backs, they might proceed straightway to Government House and\r\nseize Sir Francis, who had just come in from his daily ride on\r\nhorseback, and who was guarded by only one sentinel. His capture having\r\nbeen effected, they might proceed to the City Hall and seize the arms\r\nand ammunition. The next thing would be to proclaim a Provisional\r\nGovernment, and give Sir Francis the alternative of conceding what the\r\nRadicals demanded or taking the consequences of refusal. There was\r\nabsolutely nothing, Mackenzie averred, to interfere with the carrying\r\nout of this programme. Four-fifths of the citizens would join them when\r\nthey saw that success had attended their efforts, and of the other fifth\r\nat least half would remain neutral, while the small residue of the\r\npopulation would be too insignificant in point of numbers to render it\r\npossible for them to offer any serious opposition.\r\n\r\nSuch was the astounding scheme propounded by Mackenzie. His small\r\naudience could hardly credit the evidence of their senses. When he had\r\nproceeded thus far, Dr. Morrison could restrain himself no longer, but\r\nburst forth with an impetuosity and indignation which had but seldom\r\nbeen observed in him. He asked if it was possible that Mackenzie could\r\nbe serious in unfolding so foolhardy a design. \"This,\" said he, \"is\r\ntreason; and if you think to entrap me into any such mad scheme, you\r\nwill find I am not your man!\" He declared that if another word were said\r\non the subject he would forthwith leave the room. The others present\r\nalso repudiated the proposal with more or less of vehemence, but they\r\nall regarded it as a mad freak of Mackenzie's, and hardly worth grave\r\nconsideration. Mackenzie found that nothing was to be done, and a few\r\nminutes later the little conclave broke up.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Mackenzie called upon Dr. Rolph, who had meanwhile\r\nheard from Dr. Morrison of the proposal of the previous evening. Dr.\r\nRolph questioned Mackenzie strictly respecting the accuracy of his\r\ndetails as to the number of men who could be depended upon as adherents\r\nin the event of a revolution. Mackenzie repeated his assertion that\r\nabout four thousand could easily be got together, every one of whom was\r\nripe and ready for taking up arms. He produced certain documentary\r\nevidence which went to confirm the truth of his statements, and\r\nvehemently declared that a successful revolution was not only feasible,\r\nbut inevitable. He proposed not to wait for the proposed convention, but\r\nto speedily assemble all the men who could be got together at some\r\npoint within a few miles of the city. This he proposed to effect as\r\nsecretly as possible. The men could then advance upon the city and\r\nproceed in a body to the City Hall, where they could possess themselves\r\nof arms and ammunition. They would then be masters of the situation, and\r\ncould set up a Provisional Government on such terms as might be agreed\r\nupon. Dr. Rolph was so far impressed by the documentary and other\r\nevidence placed before him that he consented to give the matter his\r\nconsideration, and to discuss it with some of his friends.\r\n\r\nAfter turning the subject over in his mind, Dr. Rolph appears to have\r\narrived at the conclusion that the subversion of the Government was\r\nperfectly feasible. The capital of the Province was defenceless. The\r\nLieutenant-Governor had not only sent away the troops, but had\r\npersistently refused to take any steps for the organization of the\r\nmilitia. If several thousands of the people were really disposed to\r\nassert themselves, there was nothing to prevent them from carrying out\r\nthe programme outlined by Mackenzie. They could capture Toronto and\r\nseize the members of the Government before any measures could be taken\r\nto successfully oppose them. This having been quietly effected without\r\nbloodshed, it seemed probable enough that the population at large would\r\nnot refuse their support. The Reformers of the Province constituted a\r\nlarge majority of the inhabitants, and there was not a Reformer in Upper\r\nCanada but was heartily weary of Sir Francis Head and his clique. Only a\r\nsmall minority would have consented to enter upon the risks and dangers\r\nof a rebellion; but there is a great difference between a rebellion to\r\nbe encountered and one which has been successfully accomplished.\r\nThousands of persons who would strenuously refuse to have any connection\r\nwith the former would readily acquiesce in the latter. If the Government\r\nwere once subverted and in the hands of the Reformers, and if the entire\r\nReform element were in sympathy with the change, the rebellion would so\r\nfar be a success, for at this time there were comparatively few persons\r\nin the Province who cared sufficiently for the Family Compact to risk\r\nlife or limb for the purpose of restoring them to power. But there was\r\nanother important question to be considered: What would the Imperial\r\nGovernment have to say about it? If the might and majesty of Britain\r\nwere to be enlisted against the project, no Upper Canadian rebellion\r\ncould hope for permanent success, unless in the very unlikely event of\r\nnational interference on the part of the United States. But was it not\r\nprobable that the Imperial Government would be strongly impressed by\r\nthis uprising of a long-enduring and much-wronged people, and that a\r\nsense of justice would compel them to adopt a new policy with respect to\r\nthe Canadas? Should this conjecture prove to be correct, all that was\r\nsought to be effected by rebellion would have been accomplished. In any\r\ncase, the condition of the Reformers could hardly be altered for the\r\nworse. The leaders of the movement would be driven to take refuge in the\r\nStates, but some of them had already begun to regard such an emigration\r\nas desirable, for there seemed to be no future for them under Family\r\nCompact rule.\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts as these passing through his mind, Dr. Rolph had\r\nseveral conferences with Dr. Morrison, with whom Mackenzie also had some\r\nconversation after the caucus at the brewery. Dr. Morrison was disposed\r\nto attach great weight to any suggestion emanating from his professional\r\ncolleague, and when he had been placed in possession of the latter's\r\nviews he was able to contemplate a rising of the people with much\r\ngreater complacency than before. The idea gradually took form and shape\r\nin his mind. At Mackenzie's urgent request he gave him a letter\r\nintroducing Jesse Lloyd to Dr. E. B. O'Callaghan, of Montreal, who was\r\neditor of a Radical newspaper, and known to be favourable to\r\ninsurrection. Lloyd was about to start from his home in the township of\r\nKing on one of his expeditions to the Lower Province, to confer with the\r\nleaders of the insurrectionary movements there. This was sometime during\r\nthe third week in October.\r\n\r\nDr. Morrison, having thus put his hand to the plough, regarded himself\r\nas in a measure pledged to support the cause of the people, if they were\r\nreally bent on subverting the Government. One day about a fortnight\r\nlater he received an urgent message from Dr. Rolph to call at the\r\nlatter's house on Lot (Queen) Street. Upon repairing thither he found\r\nRolph and Mackenzie in conference with Lloyd, who _had_ just returned\r\nfrom the Lower Province with a letter to Mackenzie from Thomas Storrow\r\nBrown, one of the directors of the insurrectionary movement there. The\r\nletter seemed, on the surface, to be a mere business communication, but\r\nits phraseology had a secret meaning understood by Mackenzie, who\r\nexpounded it to the others. Lloyd supplemented the letter by certain\r\nverbal communications. It appeared that the Lower Canadians were\r\nprepared to act, but they wished the Upper Canadian Radicals to make the\r\nfirst move, so as to divert attention from their proceedings. This would\r\ninvolve grave consequences, and could not be resolved upon all in a\r\nmoment. After some consideration, it was agreed that Rolph, Morrison and\r\nMackenzie should meet at Morrison's house on Newgate (Adelaide) Street\r\nthat same evening to take serious counsel together. The meeting was held\r\nas agreed upon. Rolph and Morrison pointed out to Mackenzie the\r\nmomentous consequences which would flow from acting on the suggestion\r\nfrom Lower Canada. They expressed some doubt as to whether the people\r\nwere really sufficiently desirous of a change to risk their liberties\r\nand lives in a rebellion, and they pointed out the disastrous\r\nconsequences of failure. Mackenzie, however, who possessed much better\r\nopportunities for judging as to the bent of popular opinion among the\r\nRadicals, would hardly listen to such remonstrances. For the hundredth\r\ntime he pointed out the defenceless state of the capital. Within the\r\nlast few days the troops which had been removed from Toronto to Kingston\r\nhad been withdrawn from the Province altogether by Sir John Colborne, in\r\norder that they might be used against the rebels in Lower Canada. The\r\nwhole of the Upper Province was therefore without means of defence.\r\nMackenzie pledged his word that the whole Radical element were anxious\r\nto rise in the good cause. He asserted that he had received lists signed\r\nby thousands of persons, each one of whom had pledged himself to rise in\r\nrevolt at any moment when summoned. Rebellion, he declared, must come,\r\nas the spirit of insurrection had been thoroughly aroused; and he\r\nupbraided his interlocutors for their lukewarmness in the cause of the\r\npeople. After several hours of discussion and deliberation it was agreed\r\nthat Mackenzie should proceed through the country and distinctly submit\r\nthe question to the different political unions. If they really felt\r\nready and anxious to put down the existing Government by force of arms,\r\nas Mackenzie declared, they should have their way. A plan was discussed\r\nfor seizing the arms in the City Hall, for taking into custody the chief\r\nGovernment officials, and for establishing a Provisional Government with\r\nDr. Rolph at its head. All this, it was believed, could be easily\r\neffected without firing a shot, and without the sacrifice of a single\r\nlife. It was also distinctly understood that private property was to be\r\nrespected, and that all money in the banks was to be regarded as private\r\nproperty, except such as actually belonged to the Government. It was\r\nhowever expressly stipulated that nobody was to be finally committed to\r\nany definite course of procedure until Mackenzie's return from his rural\r\ntour with the sanction of the various political unions. No authority\r\nwhatever was meanwhile given to Mackenzie, either expressly or by\r\nimplication, to stir the people up to rebellion. He was simply\r\nauthorized to ascertain their views. At his own urgent request\r\npermission was given him to use the names of Rolph and Morrison, but\r\nonly so far as to state that if the people were really desirous of\r\neffecting a revolution, they might depend upon receiving the countenance\r\nof those two gentlemen. On this distinct understanding Mackenzie left\r\nDr. Morrison's house, and started the same night or early on the\r\nfollowing morning for the north.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[269] See his Despatch to Lord Glenelg, dated 5th April, 1837, in\r\nNarrative, chap. ix.\r\n\r\n[270] See his Despatch dated July 14th, 1837.\r\n\r\n[271] On the 10th of September.\r\n\r\n[272] See the number for June 10th, 1824.\r\n\r\n[273] This boast seems to have been made in the columns of _The\r\nConstitution_, but I have been unable to find it there. I make the\r\nquotation on the authority of Mr. Lindsey's _Life of Mackenzie_, vol.\r\ni., p. 395, note.\r\n\r\n[274] Mr. MacMullen, writing, doubtless, from honest conviction,\r\nendeavours to convey the impression that Bidwell was more deeply\r\nimplicated in the rebellion than he chose to acknowledge. See his\r\n_History of Canada_, p. 446, note. But no substantial proof has ever\r\nbeen offered in support of such a belief, whereas the proof on the other\r\nside is unanswerable. There is, first of all, the character of the man.\r\nHis moral courage was great, and he could stand up for a cherished\r\nprinciple with much firmness and vigour. But he fought with weapons\r\nwhich were not carnal, and would have suffered almost any wrong that\r\ncould have been inflicted upon him rather than resort to physical\r\nviolence. Then, there is the fact that he always denied all knowledge of\r\nthe rising. No man who knew Marshall Spring Bidwell would have hesitated\r\nto accept his bare word as against any but the most direct evidence to\r\nthe contrary, and in this case there can hardly be said to be any\r\ncountervailing evidence whatever. Again, there is the fact that he\r\ndeclined to act as a delegate to the proposed Reform convention, as\r\nsubsequently mentioned in the text. But there is no need to resort to\r\ncircumstantial or conjectural evidence. We have the testimony of\r\nMackenzie himself, who, after his return to Canada, was ready enough to\r\nbetray the secrets of his somewhile coadjutors, and who would have been\r\nonly too glad if he could have pointed to Bidwell as one of the number.\r\nIn his _Flag of Truce_, published in 1853, he says; \"The question is\r\noften asked me--What part Mr. Bidwell took in 1837\"--and his answer is\r\nexplicit enough: \"None that I know.\" It is quite certain that Bidwell\r\ncould not have been concerned in the movement without Mackenzie's\r\nknowledge. The only circumstances which might be adduced as indicating a\r\nknowledge of the intended rising on the part of Mr. Bidwell are two in\r\nnumber, and neither of them will bear a moment's examination. First, it\r\nis true that he was consulted by the Radicals as to the lawfulness of\r\ntheir assembling for drill exercise and other purposes. He advised that,\r\nunder certain restrictions, such assemblies were within the law, and\r\nthat there could be nothing culpable in rifle-matches involving mere\r\ntrials of skill. But when his advice was sought there was no intention,\r\neven on Mackenzie's part, to rise at any definite period, and Mr.\r\nBidwell may very well have believed that the projects would end as most\r\nof Mackenzie's enterprises had ended--in talk. The other circumstance\r\ncalling for explanation is his allowing himself to be frightened into\r\nleaving the country. This will be duly considered in its proper place.\r\nSuffice it for the present to say that, taking everything into account,\r\nthe mere fact of his expatriation affords no evidence either one way or\r\nthe other; whereas the attendant circumstances afford strong presumptive\r\nevidence of his innocence.\r\n\r\nIn examining the papers of the late David Gibson within the last few\r\nweeks _I_ have come upon what may not unfairly be regarded as conclusive\r\nevidence that Bidwell was in no manner privy to the rising. Gibson,\r\nafter his escape to the State of New York, was desirous of obtaining\r\nemployment as a land surveyor, and, at Dr. Rolph's suggestion, he wrote\r\nto Bidwell for a certificate as to his character, and for advice as to\r\nthe best means of obtaining employment. Bidwell was then in the City of\r\nNew York, casting about in his mind to what he should direct his\r\nattention as a means of livelihood. His reply and the certificate\r\nenclosed therein--both in his own handwriting--are now lying before me.\r\nThe latter is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I was acquainted with David Gibson, Esquire, until the recent\r\ndisturbance in Upper Canada, and know that by his integrity, good sense\r\nand amiable character, he had acquired the confidence and esteem of his\r\nneighbours and acquaintances. His services as a land surveyor were\r\nhighly valued. Since the trouble commenced in Upper Canada I have not\r\nbeen in communication with him, but I have no doubt that the utmost\r\nreliance may be placed on his industry, ability and fidelity in all his\r\nengagements. I have seen his name mentioned with respect for his\r\nhumanity in one of the most violent newspapers published in Upper\r\nCanada. He has my warmest wishes for his success and happiness.\r\n\r\n\"MARSHALL S. BIDWELL.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is the text of the letter accompanying the certificate:--\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR SIR:\r\n\r\n    I received to-day your letter, and have sent you a certificate. I am\r\n    unable to refer you to any place or situation for employment. I am\r\n    myself unsettled, and _do_ not know what I shall do or where I shall\r\n    settle.\r\n\r\n    I lament the recent proceedings in Upper Canada, and cannot to this\r\n    day reflect upon them but with amazement. How men of good sense like\r\n    you and others could be involved in so absurd and hopeless a project\r\n    fills me with continual surprise. However, I would not upbraid you,\r\n    though I shall perhaps be ruined in consequence of these movements.\r\n    On the contrary, I wish you well, and have the same kind feelings\r\n    towards you as I was wont to have. I trust you may find some\r\n    situation where you may be happy.\r\n\r\n    Yours truly, MARSHALL S. BIDWELL.\r\n\r\n    David Gibson, Esq., 6th March.\r\n\r\nAfter the publication of this letter--written, it will be remembered, to\r\none of the chief participators in the rebellion--it will hardly be\r\npretended that Bidwell was concerned in the enterprise. It is a\r\ncharacteristic epistle, breathing Christian kindness and good will, and,\r\nindependently of its bearing upon the question at issue, is well worthy\r\nof publication as illustrative of Bidwell's individuality.\r\n\r\n[275] For the sake of consistency I adopt a uniform spelling of this\r\ngentleman's name, which however is spelt indifferently \"Mackintosh\" and\r\n\"McIntosh,\" in the Journals of Assembly, in various official documents,\r\nin the newspapers and advertisements of the time, and even in private\r\ncorrespondence. Walton's Toronto Directory for 1837 gives it as\r\n\"McIntosh,\" which seems to have been the form commonly adopted by\r\nmembers of the family.\r\n\r\n[276] A part of this building, used as a planing-mill, is still in\r\nexistence on Bay Street, a short distance north of Adelaide Street.\r\n\r\n[277] _Life of Mackenzie_, vol. ii., p. 17.\r\n\r\n[278] According to Mr. Lindsey, James Lesslie induced his brother\r\nWilliam, who had signed the Declaration, to erase his signature. _See\r\nLife of Mackenzie_, vol. ii., p. 18.\r\n\r\n[279] See the evidence of John Elliott, on the trial of Dr. Morrison for\r\nhigh treason, at Toronto, in the following April.\r\n\r\n[280] _Correspondent and Advocate_ for Wednesday, August 2nd.\r\n\r\n[281] These were nineteen in number, and consisted of Dr. Morrison, John\r\nElliott, David Gibson, John Mackintosh, Dr. O'Grady, E. B. Gilbert, John\r\nMontgomery, Dr. John Edward Tims, J. H. Price, John Doel, M. Reynolds,\r\nEdward Wright, Robert McKay, Thomas Elliott, James Armstrong, James\r\nHunter, John Armstrong, William Ketchum and W. L. Mackenzie.\r\n\r\n[282] At a meeting held in the township of Caledon, however, during the\r\nsecond week in August, a very outspoken resolution was discussed. After\r\nsetting out with some general principles as to the duties of kings,\r\ngovernors and subjects, it ran as follows:--\"If the redress of our\r\nwrongs can be otherwise obtained, the people of Upper Canada have not a\r\njust cause to use force. But the highest obligation of a citizen being\r\nto preserve the community, and every other political duty being derived\r\nfrom, and subordinate to it, every citizen is bound to defend his\r\ncountry against its enemies, both foreign and domestic. When a\r\ngovernment is engaged in systematically oppressing a people, and\r\ndestroying their securities against future oppression, it commits the\r\nsame species of wrong to them which warrants an appeal to force against\r\na foreign enemy. The history of England and of this continent is not\r\nwanting in examples by which the rulers and the ruled may see that,\r\nalthough the people have been often willing to endure bad government\r\nwith patience, there are legal and constitutional limits to that\r\nendurance. The glorious revolutions obstinately persisting in\r\nwithholding from their subjects adequate security for good government,\r\nalthough obviously necessary for the permanence of that blessing, that\r\nthey are placing themselves in a state of hostility against the\r\ngoverned; and that to prolong a state of irresponsibility and\r\ninsecurity, such as existed in England during the reign of James II.,\r\nand as now exists in Lower Canada, is a dangerous act of aggression\r\nagainst a people. A magistrate who degenerates into a systematic\r\noppressor, and shuts the gates of justice on the public, thereby\r\nrestores them to their original right of defending themselves, for he\r\nwithholds the protection of the law, and so forfeits his claim to\r\nenforce their obedience by the authority of law.\"--For the text of this\r\nresolution I am indebted to Mr. Lindsey. See his _Life of Mackenzie_,\r\nvol. ii., p. 27, note.\r\n\r\n[283] Mr. Lindsey places the number at two hundred. See _Life of\r\nMackenzie_, vol. ii., p. 32. I have not been able to find any trace of\r\nmore than 117. Mackenzie seems to have been present at fully half of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n[284] _Ante_, p. 256.\r\n\r\n[285] _Ante_, p. 362.\r\n\r\n[286] _The Emigrant_, p. 157.\r\n\r\n[287] John Elliott, in his testimony on Dr. Morrison's trial, places the\r\ndate in October; and I have evidence in my possession that Mackenzie\r\nreceived the intimation mentioned in the text on the second Monday in\r\nOctober. The second Monday fell on the 9th. There would be no delay in\r\nsummoning the caucus, which would therefore be held on the evening of\r\neither Monday or Tuesday.\r\n\r\n[288] William A. Dutcher had a foundry on Yonge Street, where a good\r\nmany hands were employed, most of whom were readers of the\r\n_Constitution_, and supporters of the Radical cause. The Armstrong whose\r\naxe-makers it was proposed to press into service was John Armstrong, who\r\nwas himself present at the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE TO CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMy authorities for the foregoing chapter are too numerous for citation.\r\nIn addition to printed works and official records, they consist of\r\nmanuscript letters, statements, affidavits and other documents which\r\nhave never seen the light, and the most important of which will be\r\ngiven, in whole or in part, in the second volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF VOL. I.",
