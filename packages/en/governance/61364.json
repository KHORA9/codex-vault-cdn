FLEISCHMAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO NEW EDITION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the ten years that have elapsed since this book was written, events\r\nof profound importance have taken place. During this period, many of\r\nthe principles set forth in the book have been put to the test and have\r\nbeen proven true.\r\n\r\nThe book, for instance, emphasized ten years ago that industrial\r\norganizations dealing with the public must take public opinion into\r\nconsideration in the conduct of their affairs. We have seen cases in\r\nthe past decade where the public has actually stepped in and publicly\r\nsupervised industries which refused to recognize this truth.\r\n\r\nThe field of public relations counsel has developed tremendously\r\nin this period. But the broad basic principles, as originally set\r\nforth, are as valid today as they were then, when the profession was\r\na comparatively new one. It seems appropriate that this new edition,\r\nfor which the publishers have asked me to write a new foreword, should\r\nappear at a time when the new partnership of government, labor and\r\nindustry has brought public relations and its problems to the fore.\r\nThe old group relationships that make up our society have undergone and\r\nare undergoing marked changes. The peaceful harmonizing of all the new\r\nconflicting points of view will be dependent, to a great extent, upon\r\nan understanding and application by leaders of public relations and its\r\ntechnique.\r\n\r\nIn the future, each industry will have to act with increasing\r\nunderstanding in its relationship to government, to other industries,\r\nto labor, to stockholders and to the public. Each industry must be\r\ncognizant of new conditions and modify its conduct to conform to them\r\nif it is to maintain the good-will of those upon whom it depends for\r\nits very life.\r\n\r\nThis principle applies not only to industry; it applies to every kind\r\nof organization and institution that uses special pleading, whether it\r\nbe for profit or for any other cause.\r\n\r\nThe new social and economic structure in which we live today demands\r\nthis new approach to the public. Public relations has come to play an\r\nimportant part in our life.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that this book may lead to a greater recognition and\r\napplication of sound public relations principles.\r\n\r\n                                        E. L. B.\r\n\r\n_January, 1934_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nIn writing this book I have tried to set down the broad principles\r\nthat govern the new profession of public relations counsel. These\r\nprinciples I have on the one hand substantiated by the findings of\r\npsychologists, sociologists, and newspapermen--Ray Stannard Baker,\r\nW. G. Bleyer, Richard Washburn Child, Elmer Davis, John L. Given, Will\r\nIrwin, Francis E. Leupp, Walter Lippmann, William MacDougall, Everett\r\nDean Martin, H. L. Mencken, Rollo Ogden, Charles J. Rosebault, William\r\nTrotter, Oswald Garrison Villard, and others to whom I owe a debt of\r\ngratitude for their clear analyses of the public’s mind and habits;\r\nand on the other hand, I have illustrated these principles by a number\r\nof specific examples which serve to bear them out. I have quoted from\r\nthe men listed here, because the ground covered by them is part of the\r\nfield of activity of the public relations counsel. The actual cases\r\nwhich I have cited were selected because they explain the application\r\nof the theories to practice. Most of the illustrative material is drawn\r\nfrom my personal experience; a few examples from my observation of\r\nevents. I have preferred to cite facts known to the general public,\r\nin order that I might explain graphically a profession that has little\r\nprecedent, and whose few formulated rules have necessarily a limitless\r\nnumber and variety of applications.\r\n\r\nThis profession in a few years has developed from the status of circus\r\nagent stunts to what is obviously an important position in the conduct\r\nof the world’s affairs.\r\n\r\nIf I shall, by this survey of the field, stimulate a scientific\r\nattitude towards the study of public relations, I shall feel that this\r\nbook has fulfilled my purpose in writing it.\r\n\r\n                                        E. L. B.\r\n\r\nDecember, 1923.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART I--SCOPE AND FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n  CHAPTER                                                           PAGE\r\n\r\n    I  THE SCOPE OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL                      11\r\n\r\n   II  THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL; THE INCREASED AND\r\n         INCREASING IMPORTANCE OF THE PROFESSION                      34\r\n\r\n  III  THE FUNCTION OF A SPECIAL PLEADER                              50\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II--THE GROUP AND HERD\r\n\r\n    I  WHAT CONSTITUTES PUBLIC OPINION?                               61\r\n\r\n   II  IS PUBLIC OPINION STUBBORN OR MALLEABLE?                       69\r\n\r\n  III  THE INTERACTION OF PUBLIC OPINION WITH THE FORCES THAT\r\n         HELP TO MAKE IT                                              77\r\n\r\n   IV  THE POWER OF INTERACTING FORCES THAT GO TO MAKE UP PUBLIC\r\n         OPINION                                                      87\r\n\r\n    V  AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PUBLIC MOTIVATION\r\n         IS NECESSARY TO THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL\r\n                                                                      98\r\n\r\n   VI  THE GROUP AND HERD ARE THE BASIC MECHANISMS OF PUBLIC\r\n         CHANGE                                                      111\r\n\r\n  VII  THE APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES                           118\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART III--TECHNIQUE AND METHOD\r\n\r\n    I  THE PUBLIC CAN BE REACHED ONLY THROUGH ESTABLISHED\r\n         MEDIUMS OF COMMUNICATION                                    125\r\n\r\n   II  THE INTERLAPPING GROUP FORMATIONS OF SOCIETY, THE\r\n         CONTINUOUS SHIFTING OF GROUPS, CHANGING CONDITIONS AND\r\n         THE FLEXIBILITY OF HUMAN NATURE ARE ALL AIDS TO THE\r\n         COUNSEL ON PUBLIC RELATIONS                                 139\r\n\r\n  III  AN OUTLINE OF METHODS PRACTICABLE IN MODIFYING THE POINT\r\n         OF VIEW OF A GROUP                                          166\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART IV--ETHICAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\n    I  A CONSIDERATION OF THE PRESS AND OTHER MEDIUMS OF\r\n         COMMUNICATION IN THEIR RELATION TO THE PUBLIC RELATIONS\r\n         COUNSEL                                                     177\r\n\r\n   II  HIS OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AS A SPECIAL PLEADER            208\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I\r\n\r\nSCOPE AND FUNCTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRYSTALLIZING PUBLIC OPINION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE SCOPE OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL\r\n\r\n\r\nA new phrase has come into the language--counsel on public relations.\r\nWhat does it mean?\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the actual phrase is completely understood by\r\nonly a few, and those only the people intimately associated with the\r\nwork itself. But despite this, the activities of the public relations\r\ncounsel affect the daily life of the entire population in one form or\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nBecause of the recent extraordinary growth of the profession of public\r\nrelations counsel and the lack of available information concerning\r\nit, an air of mystery has surrounded its scope and functions. To the\r\naverage person, this profession is still unexplained, both in its\r\noperation and actual accomplishment. Perhaps the most definite picture\r\nis that of a man who somehow or other produces that vaguely defined\r\nevil, “propaganda,” which spreads an impression that colors the mind\r\nof the public concerning actresses, governments, railroads. And yet,\r\nas will be pointed out shortly, there is probably no single profession\r\nwhich within the last ten years has extended its field of usefulness\r\nmore remarkably and touched upon intimate and important aspects of the\r\neveryday life of the world more significantly than the profession of\r\npublic relations counsel.\r\n\r\nThere is not even any one name by which the new profession is\r\ncharacterized by others. To some the public relations counsel is known\r\nby the term “propagandist.” Others still call him press agent or\r\npublicity man. Writing even within the last few years, John L. Given,\r\nthe author of an excellent textbook on journalism, does not mention the\r\npublic relations counsel. He limits his reference to the old-time press\r\nagent. Many organizations simply do not bother about an individual name\r\nand assign to an existing officer the duties of the public relations\r\ncounsel. One bank’s vice-president is its recognized public relations\r\ncounsel. Some dismiss the subject or condemn the entire profession\r\ngenerally and all its members individually.\r\n\r\nSlight examination into the grounds for this disapproval readily\r\nreveals that it is based on nothing more substantial than vague\r\nimpressions.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it is probably true that the very men who are themselves\r\nengaged in the profession are as little ready or able to define their\r\nwork as is the general public itself. Undoubtedly this is due, in\r\nsome measure, to the fact that the profession is a new one. Much more\r\nimportant than that, however, is the fact that most human activities\r\nare based on experience rather than analysis.\r\n\r\nJudge Cardozo of the Court of Appeals of the State of New York finds\r\nthe same absence of functional definition in the judicial mind. “The\r\nwork of deciding cases,” he says, “goes on every day in hundreds of\r\ncourts throughout the land. Any judge, one might suppose, would find\r\nit easy to describe the process which he had followed a thousand times\r\nand more. Nothing could be farther from the truth. Let some intelligent\r\nlayman ask him to explain. He will not go very far before taking refuge\r\nin the excuse that the language of craftsmen is unintelligible to those\r\nuntutored in the craft. Such an excuse may cover with a semblance\r\nof respectability an otherwise ignominious retreat. It will hardly\r\nserve to still the prick of curiosity and conscience. In moments of\r\nintrospection, when there is no longer a necessity of putting off with\r\na show of wisdom the uninitiated interlocutor, the troublesome problem\r\nwill recur and press for a solution: What is it that I do when I decide\r\na case?”[1]\r\n\r\nFrom my own records and from current history still fresh in the public\r\nmind, I have selected a few instances which only in a limited measure\r\ngive some idea of the variety of the public relations counsel’s work\r\nand of the type of problem which he attempts to solve.\r\n\r\nThese examples show him in his position as one who directs and\r\nsupervises the activities of his clients wherever they impinge upon\r\nthe daily life of the public. He interprets the client to the public,\r\nwhich he is enabled to do in part because he interprets the public to\r\nthe client. His advice is given on all occasions on which his client\r\nappears before the public, whether it be in concrete form or as an\r\nidea. His advice is given not only on actions which take place, but\r\nalso on the use of mediums which bring these actions to the public it\r\nis desired to reach, no matter whether these mediums be the printed,\r\nthe spoken or the visualized word--that is, advertising, lectures, the\r\nstage, the pulpit, the newspaper, the photograph, the wireless, the\r\nmail or any other form of thought communication.\r\n\r\nA nationally famous New York hotel found that its business was falling\r\noff at an alarming rate because of a rumor that it was shortly going\r\nto close and that the site upon which it was located would be occupied\r\nby a department store. Few things are more mysterious than the origins\r\nof rumors, or the credence which they manage to obtain. Reservations at\r\nthis hotel for weeks and months ahead were being canceled by persons\r\nwho had heard the rumor and accepted it implicitly.\r\n\r\nThe problem of meeting this rumor (which like many rumors had no\r\nfoundation in fact) was not only a difficult but a serious one. Mere\r\ndenial, of course, no matter how vigorous or how widely disseminated,\r\nwould accomplish little.\r\n\r\nThe mere statement of the problem made it clear to the public relations\r\ncounsel who was retained by the hotel that the only way to overcome the\r\nrumor was to give the public some positive evidence of the intention of\r\nthe hotel to remain in business. It happened that the _maître d’hôtel_\r\nwas about as well known as the hotel itself. His contract was about to\r\nexpire. The public relations counsel suggested a very simple device.\r\n\r\n“Renew his engagement immediately for a term of years,” he said. “Then\r\nmake public announcement of the fact. Nobody who hears of the renewal\r\nor the amount of money involved will believe for a moment that you\r\nintend to go out of business.” The _maître d’hôtel_ was called in and\r\noffered a five-year engagement. His salary was one which many bank\r\npresidents might envy. Public announcement of his engagement was made.\r\nThe _maître d’hôtel_ was himself something of a national figure. The\r\nsalary stipulated was not without popular interest from both points of\r\nview. The story was one which immediately interested the newspapers.\r\nA national press service took up the story and sent it out to all its\r\nsubscribers. The cancellation of reservations stopped and the rumor\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nA nationally known magazine was ambitious to increase its prestige\r\namong a more influential group of advertisers. It had never made any\r\neffort to reach this public except through its own direct circulation.\r\nThe consultant who was retained by the magazine quickly discovered that\r\nmuch valuable editorial material appearing in the magazine was allowed\r\nto go to waste. Features of interest to thousands of potential readers\r\nwere never called to their attention unless they happened accidentally\r\nto be readers of the magazine.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel showed how to extend the field of their\r\nappeal. He chose for his first work an extremely interesting article\r\nby a well-known physician, written about the interesting thesis that\r\n“the pace that kills” is the slow, deadly, dull routine pace and not\r\nthe pace of life under high pressure, based on work which interests\r\nand excites. The consultant arranged to have the thesis of the article\r\nmade the basis of an inquiry among business and professional men\r\nthroughout the country by another physician associated with a medical\r\njournal. Hundreds of members of “the quality public,” as they are known\r\nto advertisers, had their attention focused on the article, and the\r\nmagazine which the consultant was engaged in counseling on its public\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nThe answers from these leading men of the country were collated,\r\nanalyzed, and the resulting abstract furnished gratuitously to\r\nnewspapers, magazines and class journals, which published them widely.\r\nOrganizations of business and professional men reprinted the symposium\r\nby the thousands and distributed it free of charge, doing so because\r\nthe material contained in the symposium was of great interest. A\r\ndistinguished visitor from abroad, Lord Leverhulme, became interested\r\nin the question while in this country and made the magazine and\r\nthe article the basis of an address before a large and influential\r\nconference in England. Nationally and internationally the magazine\r\nwas called to the attention of a public which had, up to that time,\r\nconsidered it perhaps a publication of no serious social significance.\r\n\r\nStill working with the same magazine, the publicity consultant advised\r\nit how to widen its influence with another public on quite a different\r\nissue. He took as his subject an article by Sir Philip Gibbs, “The\r\nMadonna of the Hungry Child,” dealing with the famine situation in\r\nEurope and the necessity for its prompt alleviation. The article was\r\nbrought to the attention of Herbert Hoover. Mr. Hoover was so impressed\r\nby the article that he sent the magazine a letter of commendation for\r\npublishing it. He also sent a copy of the article to members of his\r\nrelief committees throughout the country. The latter, in turn, used\r\nthe article to obtain support and contributions for relief work. Thus,\r\nwhile an important humanitarian project was being materially assisted,\r\nthe magazine in question was adding to its own influence and standing.\r\n\r\nNow, the interesting thing about this work is that whereas the public\r\nrelations counsel added nothing to the contents of the magazine, which\r\nhad for years been publishing material of this nature, he did make its\r\nimportance felt and appreciated.\r\n\r\nA large packing house was faced with the problem of increasing the\r\nsale of its particular brand of bacon. It already dominated the\r\nmarket in its field; the problem was therefore one of increasing\r\nthe consumption of bacon generally, for its dominance of the market\r\nwould naturally continue. The public relations counsel, realizing that\r\nhearty breakfasts were dietetically sound, suggested that a physician\r\nundertake a survey to make this medical truth articulate. He realized\r\nthat the demand for bacon as a breakfast food would naturally be\r\nincreased by the wide dissemination of this truth. This is exactly what\r\nhappened.\r\n\r\nA hair-net company had to solve the problem created by the increasing\r\nvogue of bobbed hair. Bobbed hair was eliminating the use of the\r\nhair-net. The public relations counsel, after investigation, advised\r\nthat the opinions of club women as leaders of the women of the country\r\nshould be made articulate on the question. Their expressed opinion,\r\nhe believed, would definitely modify the bobbed hair vogue. A leading\r\nartist was interested in the subject and undertook a survey among the\r\nclub women leaders of the country. The resultant responses confirmed\r\nthe public relations counsel’s judgment. The opinions of these women\r\nwere given to the public and helped to arouse what had evidently been\r\na latent opinion on the question. Long hair was made socially more\r\nacceptable than bobbed hair and the vogue for the latter was thereby\r\npartially checked.\r\n\r\nA real estate corporation on Long Island was interested in selling\r\ncoöperative apartments to a high-class clientele. In order to do this,\r\nit realized that it had to impress upon the public the fact that this\r\ncommunity, within easy reach of Manhattan, was socially, economically,\r\nartistically and morally desirable. On the advice of its public\r\nrelations counsel, instead of merely proclaiming itself as such a\r\ncommunity, it proved its contentions dramatically by making itself an\r\nactive center for all kinds of community manifestations.\r\n\r\nWhen it opened its first post office, for instance, it made this local\r\nevent nationally interesting. The opening was a formal one. National\r\nfigures became interested in what might have been merely a local event.\r\n\r\nThe reverses which the Italians suffered on the Piave in 1918 were\r\ndangerous to Italian and Allied morale. One of the results was the\r\nawakening of a distrust among Italians as to the sincerity of American\r\npromises of military, financial and moral support for the Italian cause.\r\n\r\nIt became imperative vividly to dramatize for Italy the reality of\r\nAmerican coöperation. As one of the means to this end the Committee\r\non Public Information decided that the naming of a recently completed\r\nAmerican ship should be made the occasion for a demonstration of\r\nfriendship which could be reflected in every possible way to the\r\nItalians.\r\n\r\nProminent Italians in America were invited by the public relations\r\ncounsel to participate in the launching of the _Piave_. Motion and\r\nstill pictures were taken of the event. The news of the launching and\r\nof its significance to Americans was telegraphed to Italian newspapers.\r\nAt the same time a message from Italian-Americans was transmitted\r\nto Italy expressing their confidence in America’s assistance of\r\nthe Italian cause. Enrico Caruso, Gatti-Casazza, director of the\r\nMetropolitan Opera, and others highly regarded by their countrymen in\r\nItaly, sent inspiriting telegrams which had a decided effect in raising\r\nItalian morale, so far as it depended upon assurance of American\r\ncoöperation. Other means employed to disseminate information of this\r\nevent had the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe next incident that I have selected is one which conforms more\r\nclosely than some of the others to the popular conception of the work\r\nof the public relations counsel. In the spring and summer of 1919 the\r\nproblem of fitting ex-service men into the ordinary life of America\r\nwas serious and difficult. Thousands of men just back from abroad were\r\nhaving a trying time finding work. After their experience in the war it\r\nwas not surprising that they should be extremely ready to feel bitter\r\nagainst the Government and against those Americans who for one reason\r\nor another had not been in any branch of the service during the war.\r\n\r\nThe War Department under Colonel Arthur Woods, assistant to the\r\nSecretary of War, instituted a nation-wide campaign to assist those\r\nmen to obtain employment, and more than that, to manifest to them as\r\nconcretely as it could that the Government continued its interest in\r\ntheir welfare. The incident to which I refer occurred during this\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nIn July of 1919 there was such a shortage of labor in Kansas that it\r\nwas feared a large proportion of the wheat crop could not possibly be\r\nharvested. The activities of the War Department in the reëmployment of\r\nex-service men had already received wide publicity, and the Chamber\r\nof Commerce of Kansas City appealed directly to the War Department\r\nat Washington, after its own efforts in many other directions had\r\nfailed, for a supply of men who would assist in the harvesting of the\r\nwheat crop. The public relations counsel prepared a statement of this\r\nopportunity for employment in Kansas and distributed it to the public\r\nthrough the newspapers throughout the country. The Associated Press\r\nsent the statement over its wires as a news dispatch. Within four days\r\nthe Kansas City Chamber of Commerce wired to the War Department that\r\nenough labor had been secured to harvest the wheat crop, and asked\r\nthe War Department to announce that fact as publicly as it had first\r\nannounced the need for labor.\r\n\r\nBy contrast with this last instance, and as an illustration of a type\r\nof work less well understood by the public, I cite another incident\r\nfrom the same campaign for the reëstablishment of ex-service men to\r\nnormal economic and social relations. The problem of reëmployment was,\r\nof course, the crux of the difficulty. Various measures were adopted\r\nto obtain the coöperation of business men in extending employment\r\nopportunities to ex-members of the Army, Navy and Marines. One of these\r\ndevices appealed to the personal and local pride of American business\r\nmen, and stressed their obligation of honor to reëmploy their former\r\nemployees upon release from Government service.\r\n\r\nA citation was prepared, signed by the Secretary of War, the Secretary\r\nof the Navy and the Assistant to the Secretary of War for display in\r\nthe stores and factories of employers who assured the War and Navy\r\nDepartments that they would reëmploy their ex-service men. Simultaneous\r\ndisplay of these citations was arranged for Bastile Day, July 14, 1919,\r\nby members of the Fifth Avenue Association.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth Avenue Association of New York City, an influential group\r\nof business men, was perhaps the first to coöperate as a body in this\r\nimportant campaign for the reëmployment of ex-service men. Concerted\r\naction on a subject which was as much in the public mind as the\r\nreëmployment of ex-service men was particularly interesting. The story\r\nof what these leaders in American business had undertaken to do went\r\nout to the country by mail, by word of mouth, by newspaper comment.\r\nTheir example was potent in obtaining the coöperation of business men\r\nthroughout the land. An appeal based on this action and capitalizing\r\nit was sent to thousands of individual business men and employers\r\nthroughout the country. It was effective.\r\n\r\nAn illustration which embodies most of the technical and psychological\r\npoints of interest in the preceding incidents may be found in\r\nLithuania’s campaign in this country in 1919, for popular sympathy\r\nand official recognition. Lithuania was of considerable political\r\nimportance in the reorganization of Europe, but it was a country little\r\nknown or understood by the American public. An added difficulty was the\r\nfact that the independence of Lithuania would interfere seriously with\r\nthe plans which France had for the establishment of a strong Poland.\r\nThere were excellent historical, ethnic and economic reasons why, if\r\nLithuania broke off from Russia, it should be allowed to stand on its\r\nown feet. On the other hand there were powerful political influences\r\nwhich were against such a result. The American attitude on the question\r\nof Lithuanian independence, it was felt, would play an important\r\npart. The question was how to arouse popular and official interest in\r\nLithuania’s aspirations.\r\n\r\nA Lithuanian National Council was organized, composed of prominent\r\nAmerican-Lithuanians, and a Lithuanian Information Bureau established\r\nto act as a clearing house for news about Lithuania and for special\r\npleading on behalf of Lithuania’s ambitions. The public relations\r\ncounsel who was retained to direct this work recognized that the first\r\nproblem to be solved was America’s indifference to and ignorance about\r\nLithuania and its desires.\r\n\r\nHe had an exhaustive study made of every conceivable aspect of\r\nthe problem of Lithuania from its remote and recent history and\r\nethnic origins to its present-day marriage customs and its popular\r\nrecreations. He divided his material into its various categories, based\r\nprimarily on the public to which it would probably make its appeal.\r\nFor the amateur ethnologist he provided interesting and accurate data\r\nof the racial origins of Lithuania. To the student of languages he\r\nappealed with authentic and well written studies of the development of\r\nthe Lithuanian language from its origins in the Sanskrit. He told the\r\n“sporting fan” about Lithuanian sports and told American women about\r\nLithuanian clothes. He told the jeweler about amber and provided the\r\nmusic lover with concerts of Lithuanian music.\r\n\r\nTo the senators, he gave facts about Lithuania which would give\r\nthem basis for favorable action. To the members of the House of\r\nRepresentatives he did likewise. He reflected to those communities\r\nwhose crystallized opinion would be helpful in guiding other opinions,\r\nfacts which gave them basis for conclusions favorable to Lithuania.\r\n\r\nA series of events which would carry with them the desired implications\r\nwere planned and executed. Mass meetings were held in different cities;\r\npetitions were drawn, signed and presented; pilgrims made calls upon\r\nSenate and House of Representatives Committees. All the avenues of\r\napproach to the public were utilized to capitalize the public interest\r\nand bring public action. The mails carried statements of Lithuania’s\r\nposition to individuals who might be interested. The lecture platform\r\nresounded to Lithuania’s appeal. Newspaper advertising was bought and\r\npaid for. The radio carried the message of speakers to the public.\r\nMotion pictures reached the patrons of moving picture houses.\r\n\r\nLittle by little and phase by phase, the public, the press and\r\nGovernment officials acquired a knowledge of the customs, the character\r\nand the problems of Lithuania, the small Baltic nation that was seeking\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\nWhen the Lithuanian Information Bureau went before the press\r\nassociations to correct inaccurate or misleading Polish news about the\r\nLithuanian situation, it came there as representative of a group which\r\nhad figured largely in the American news for a number of weeks, as a\r\nresult of the advice and activities of its public relations counsel.\r\nIn the same way, when delegations of Americans, interested in the\r\nLithuanian problem, appeared before members of Congress or officials\r\nof the State Department, they came there as spokesmen for a country\r\nwhich was no longer unknown. They represented a group which could no\r\nlonger be entirely ignored. Somebody described this campaign, once it\r\nhad achieved recognition for the Baltic republic, as the campaign of\r\n“advertising a nation to freedom.”\r\n\r\nWhat happened with Roumania is another instance. Roumania wanted to\r\nplead its case before the American people. It wanted to tell Americans\r\nthat it was an ancient and established country. The original technique\r\nwas the issuance of treatises, historically correct and ethnologically\r\naccurate. Their facts were for the large part ignored. The public\r\nrelations counsel, called in on the case of Roumania, advised them to\r\nmake these studies into interesting stories of news value. The public\r\nread these stories with avidity and Roumania became part of America’s\r\npopular knowledge with consequent valuable results for Roumania.\r\n\r\nThe hotels of New York City discovered that there was a falling off of\r\nbusiness and profits. Fewer visitors came to New York. Fewer travelers\r\npassed through New York on their way to Europe. The public relations\r\ncounsel who was consulted and asked to remedy the situation, made an\r\nextensive analysis. He talked to visitors. He queried men and women\r\nwho represented groups, sections and opinions of main cities and\r\ntowns throughout the country. He examined American literature--books,\r\nmagazines, newspapers, and classified attacks made on New York and New\r\nYork citizens. He found that the chief cause for lack of interest in\r\nNew York was the belief that New York was “cold and inhospitable.”\r\n\r\nHe found animosity and bitterness against New York’s apparent\r\nindifference to strangers was keeping away a growing number of\r\ntravelers. To counteract this damaging wave of resentment, he called\r\ntogether the leading groups, industrial, social and civic, of New\r\nYork, and formed the Welcome Stranger Committee. The friendly and\r\nhospitable aims of this committee, broadcasted to the nation, helped\r\nto reëstablish New York’s good repute. Congratulatory editorials were\r\nprinted in the rural and city journals of the country.\r\n\r\nAgain, in analyzing the restaurant service of a prominent hotel, he\r\ndiscovers that its menu is built on the desires of the average eater\r\nand that a large group of people with children desire special foods\r\nfor them. He may then advise his client to institute a children’s diet\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis was done specifically with the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, which\r\ninstituted special menus for children. This move, which excited wide\r\ncomment, was economically and dietetically sound.\r\n\r\nIn its campaign to educate the public on the importance of early radium\r\ntreatments for incipient cancer, the United States Radium Corporation\r\nfounded the First National Radium Bank, in order to create and\r\ncrystallize the impression that radium is and should be available to\r\nall physicians who treat cancer sufferers.\r\n\r\nAn inter-city radio company planned to open a wireless service between\r\nthe three cities of New York, Detroit and Cleveland. This company might\r\nmerely have opened its service and waited for the public to send its\r\nmessages, but the president of the organization realized astutely that\r\nto succeed in any measure at all he must have immediate public support.\r\nHe called in a public relations counsel, who advised an elaborate\r\ninauguration ceremony, in which the mayors of the three cities thus\r\nfor the first time connected, would officiate. The mayor of each city\r\nofficially received and sent the first messages issued on commercial\r\ninter-city radio waves. These openings excited wide interest, not only\r\nin the three cities directly concerned, but throughout the entire\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nShortly after the World War, the King and Queen of the Belgians visited\r\nAmerica. One of the many desired results of this visit was that it\r\nshould be made apparent that America, with all the foreign elements\r\nrepresented in its body, was unified in its support of King Albert\r\nand his country. To present a graphic picture of the affection which\r\nthe national elements here had for the Belgian monarch, a performance\r\nwas staged at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City, at which\r\nthe many nationalist groups were represented and gave voice to their\r\napproval. The story of the Metropolitan Opera House performance was\r\nspread in the news columns and by photographs in the press throughout\r\nthe world. It was evident to all who saw the pictures or read the story\r\nthat this king had really stirred the affectionate interest of the\r\nnational elements that make up America.\r\n\r\nAn interesting illustration of the broad field of work of the public\r\nrelations counsel to-day is noted in the efforts which were exerted to\r\nsecure wide commendation and support among Americans for the League\r\nof Nations. Obviously a small group of persons, banded together for\r\nthe sole purpose of furthering the appeal of the League, would have no\r\npowerful effect. In order to secure a certain homogeneity among the\r\nmembers of groups who individually had widely varied interests and\r\naffiliations, it was decided to form a non-partisan committee for the\r\nLeague of Nations.\r\n\r\nThe public relations consultant, having assisted in the formation of\r\nthis committee, called a meeting of women representing Democratic,\r\nRepublican, radical, reactionary, club, society, professional and\r\nindustrial groups, and suggested that they make a united appeal for\r\nnational support of the League of Nations. This meeting accurately and\r\ndramatically reflected disinterested and unified support of the League.\r\nThe public relations counsel made articulate what would otherwise have\r\nremained a strong passive sentiment. The still insistent demand for\r\nthe League of Nations is undoubtedly due in part to efforts of this\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nCases as diverse as the following are the daily work of the public\r\nrelations counsel. One client is advised to give up a Rolls-Royce car\r\nand to buy a Ford, because the public has definite concepts of what\r\nownership of each represents--another man may be given the contrary\r\nadvice. One client is advised to withdraw the hat-check privilege,\r\nbecause it causes unfavorable public comment. Another is advised to\r\nchange the façade of his building to conform to a certain public taste.\r\n\r\nOne client is advised to announce changes of price policy to the public\r\nby telegraph, another by circular, another by advertising. One client\r\nis advised to publish a Bible, another a book of French Renaissance\r\ntales.\r\n\r\nOne department store is advised to use prices in its advertising,\r\nanother store not to mention them.\r\n\r\nA client is advised to make his labor policy, the hygienic aspect of\r\nhis factory, his own personality, part of his sales campaign.\r\n\r\nAnother client is advised to exhibit his wares in a museum and school.\r\n\r\nStill another is urged to found a scholarship in his subject at a\r\nleading university.\r\n\r\nFurther incidents could be given here, illustrating different aspects\r\nof the ordinary daily functions of the public relations counsel--how,\r\nfor example, the production of “Damaged Goods” in America became\r\nthe basis of the first notably successful move in this country for\r\novercoming the prudish refusal to appreciate and face the place of\r\nsex in human life; or how, more recently, the desire of some great\r\ncorporations to increase their business was, through the advice of\r\nIvy Lee, their public relations counsel, made the basis of popular\r\neducation on the importance of brass and copper to civilization. Enough\r\nhas been cited, however, to show how little the average member of the\r\npublic knows of the real work of the public relations counsel, and\r\nhow that work impinges upon the daily life of the public in an almost\r\ninfinite number of ways.\r\n\r\nPopular misunderstanding of the work of the public relations counsel is\r\neasily comprehensible because of the short period of his development.\r\nNevertheless, the fact remains that he has become in recent years too\r\nimportant a figure in American life for this ignorance to be safely or\r\nprofitably continued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL; THE INCREASED AND INCREASING IMPORTANCE\r\nOF THE PROFESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rise of the modern public relations counsel is based on the need\r\nfor and the value of his services. Perhaps the most significant\r\nsocial, political and industrial fact about the present century is\r\nthe increased attention which is paid to public opinion, not only by\r\nindividuals, groups or movements that are dependent on public support\r\nfor their success, but also by men and organizations which until very\r\nrecently stood aloof from the general public and were able to say, “The\r\npublic be damned.”\r\n\r\nThe public to-day demands information and expects also to be accepted\r\nas judge and jury in matters that have a wide public import. The\r\npublic, whether it invests its money in subway or railroad tickets,\r\nin hotel rooms or restaurant fare, in silk or soap, is a highly\r\nsophisticated body. It asks questions, and if the answer in word or\r\naction is not forthcoming or satisfactory, it turns to other sources\r\nfor information or relief.\r\n\r\nThe willingness to spend thousands of dollars in obtaining\r\nprofessional advice on how best to present one’s views or products to a\r\npublic is based on this fact.\r\n\r\nOn every side of American life, whether political, industrial, social,\r\nreligious or scientific, the increasing pressure of public judgment has\r\nmade itself felt. Generally speaking, the relationship and interaction\r\nof the public and any movement is rather obvious. The charitable\r\nsociety which depends upon voluntary contributions for its support\r\nhas a clear and direct interest in being favorably represented before\r\nthe public. In the same way, the great corporation which is in danger\r\nof having its profits taxed away or its sales fall off or its freedom\r\nimpeded by legislative action must have recourse to the public to\r\ncombat successfully these menaces. Behind these obvious phenomena,\r\nhowever, lie three recent tendencies of fundamental importance; first,\r\nthe tendency of small organizations to aggregate into groups of such\r\nsize and importance that the public tends to regard them as semi-public\r\nservices; second, the increased readiness of the public, due to the\r\nspread of literacy and democratic forms of government, to feel that it\r\nis entitled to its voice in the conduct of these large aggregations,\r\npolitical, capitalist or labor, or whatever they may be; third, the\r\nkeen competition for public favor due to modern methods of “selling.”\r\n\r\nAn example of the first tendency--that is, the tendency toward an\r\nincreased public interest in industrial activity, because of the\r\nincreasing social importance of industrial aggregations--may be found\r\nin an article on “The Critic and the Law” by Richard Washburn Child,\r\npublished in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for May, 1906.\r\n\r\nMr. Child discusses in that article the right of the critic to say\r\nuncomplimentary things about matters of public interest. He points\r\nout the legal basis for the right to criticize plays and novels. Then\r\nhe adds, “A vastly more important and interesting theory, and one\r\nwhich must arise from the present state and tendency of industrial\r\nconditions, is whether the acts of men in commercial activity may\r\never become so prominent and so far reaching in their effect that\r\nthey compel a universal public interest and that public comment is\r\nimpliedly invited by reason of their conspicuous and semi-public\r\nnature. It may be said that at no time have private industries become\r\nof such startling interest to the community at large as at present\r\nin the United States.” How far present-day tendencies have borne out\r\nMr. Child’s expectation of a growing and accepted public interest in\r\nimportant industrial enterprises, the reader can judge for himself.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the second tendency--the increased readiness of the\r\npublic to expect information about and to be heard on matters of\r\npolitical and social interest--Ray Stannard Baker’s description of\r\nthe American journalist at the Peace Conference of Versailles gives\r\nan excellent picture. Mr. Baker tells what a shock American newspaper\r\nmen gave Old World diplomats because at the Paris conference they\r\n“had come, not begging, but demanding. They sat at every doorway,”\r\nsays Mr. Baker. “They looked over every shoulder. They wanted every\r\nresolution and report and wanted it immediately. I shall never forget\r\nthe delegation of American newspaper men, led by John Nevin, I saw\r\ncome striding through that Holy of Holies, the French Foreign Office,\r\ndemanding that they be admitted to the first general session of the\r\nPeace Conference. They horrified the upholders of the old methods, they\r\ndesperately offended the ancient conventions, they were as rough and\r\ndirect as democracy itself.”\r\n\r\nAnd I shall never forget the same feeling brought home to me, when\r\nHerbert Bayard Swope of the _New York World_, in the press room at\r\nthe Crillon Hotel in Paris, led the discussion of the newspaper\r\nrepresentatives who forced the conference to regard public opinion and\r\nadmit newspaper men, and give out communiques daily.\r\n\r\nThat the pressure of the public for admittance to the mysteries of\r\nforeign affairs is being felt by the nations of the world may be seen\r\nfrom the following dispatch published in the _New York Herald_ under\r\nthe date line of the _New York Herald_ Bureau, Paris, January 17,\r\n1922: “The success of Lord Riddell in getting publicity for British\r\nopinion during the Washington conference, while the French viewpoint\r\nwas not stressed, may result in the appointment by the Poincaré\r\nGovernment of a real propaganda agent to meet the foreign newspaper\r\nmen. The _Eclair_ to-day calls on the new premier to ‘find his own\r\nLord Riddell in the French diplomatic and parliamentary world, who can\r\ngive the world the French interpretation.’” Walter Lippmann of the\r\n_New York World_ in his volume “Public Opinion” declares that “the\r\nsignificant revolution of modern times is not industrial or economic\r\nor political, but the revolution which is taking place in the art of\r\ncreating consent among the governed.” He goes on: “Within the life of\r\nthe new generation now in control of affairs, persuasion has become a\r\nself-conscious art and a regular organ of popular government. None of\r\nus begins to understand the consequences, but it is no daring prophecy\r\nto say that the knowledge of how to create consent will alter every\r\npolitical premise. Under the impact of propaganda, not necessarily\r\nin the sinister meaning of the word alone, the only constants of our\r\nthinking have become variables. It is no longer possible, for example,\r\nto believe in the cardinal dogma of democracy, that the knowledge\r\nneeded for the management of human affairs comes up spontaneously from\r\nthe human heart. Where we act on that theory we expose ourselves to\r\nself-deception and to forms of persuasion that we cannot verify. It has\r\nbeen demonstrated that we cannot rely upon intuition, conscience, or\r\nthe accidents of casual opinion if we are to deal with the world beyond\r\nour reach.”[2]\r\n\r\nIn domestic affairs the importance of public opinion not only in\r\npolitical decisions but in the daily industrial life of the nation may\r\nbe seen from numerous incidents. In the _New York Times_ of Friday,\r\nMay 20, 1922, I find almost a column article with the heading “Hoover\r\nPrescribes Publicity for Coal.” Among the improvements in the coal\r\nindustry generally, which Mr. Hoover, according to the dispatch,\r\nanticipates from widespread, accurate and informative publicity about\r\nthe industry itself, are the stimulation of industrial consumers\r\nto more regular demands, the ability to forecast more reliably the\r\nvolume of demand, the ability of the consumer to “form some judgment\r\nas to the prices he should pay for coal,” and the tendency to hold\r\ndown over-expansion in the industry by publication of the ratio of\r\nproduction to capacity. Mr. Hoover concludes that really informative\r\npublicity “would protect the great majority of operators from the\r\ncriticism that can only be properly leveled at the minority.” Not\r\nso many years ago neither the majority nor the minority in the coal\r\nindustry would have concerned itself about public criticism of the\r\nindustry.\r\n\r\nFrom coal to jewelry seems rather a long step, and yet in _The\r\nJeweler’s Circular_, a trade magazine, I find much comment upon the\r\nNational Jewelers’ Publicity Association. This association began with\r\nthe simple commercial ambition of acquainting the public with “the\r\nvalue of jewelry merchandise for gift purposes”; now it finds itself\r\nengaged in eliminating from the public mind in general, and from the\r\nminds of legislators in particular, the impression that “the jewelry\r\nbusiness is absolutely useless and that any money spent in a jewelry\r\nstore is thrown away.”\r\n\r\nNot so long ago it would scarcely have occurred to any one in the\r\njewelry industry that there was any importance to be attached to the\r\nopinion of the public on the essential or non-essential character of\r\nthe jewelry industry. To-day, on the other hand, jewelers find it a\r\nprofitable investment to bring before the people the fact that table\r\nsilver is an essential in modern life, and that without watches “the\r\nbusiness and industries of the nations would be a sad chaos.” With all\r\nthe other competing interests in the world to-day, the question as to\r\nwhether the public considers the business of manufacturing and selling\r\njewelry essential or non-essential is a matter of the first importance\r\nto the industry.\r\n\r\nThe best examples, of course, of the increasing importance of public\r\nopinion to industries which until recently scarcely concerned\r\nthemselves with the existence or non-existence of a public opinion\r\nabout them, are those industries which are charged with a public\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nIn a long article about the attitude of the public towards the\r\nrailroads, the _Railway Age_ reaches the conclusion that the most\r\nimportant problem which American railroads must solve is “the problem\r\nof selling themselves to the public.” Some public utilities maintain\r\npublic relations departments, whose function it is to interpret the\r\norganizations to the public, as much as to interpret the public to\r\nthem. The significant thing, however, is not the accepted importance of\r\npublic opinion in this or the other individual industry, but the fact\r\nthat public opinion is becoming cumulatively more and more articulate\r\nand therefore more important to industrial life as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe New York Central Railroad, for example, maintains a Public\r\nRelations Department under Pitt Hand, whose function it is to make it\r\nclear to the public that the railroad is functioning efficiently to\r\nserve the public in every possible way. This department studies the\r\npublic and tries to discover where the railroad’s service can be mended\r\nor improved, or when wrong or harmful impressions upon the public mind\r\nmay be corrected.\r\n\r\nThis Public Relations Department finds it profitable not only to bring\r\nto the attention of the public the salient facts about its trains, its\r\ntime tables, and its actual traveling facilities, but also to build\r\nup a broadly coöperative spirit that is indirectly of great value to\r\nitself and benefit to the public. It coöperates, for example, with\r\nsuch movements as the Welcome Stranger Committee of New York City in\r\ndistributing literature to travelers to assist them when they reach\r\nthe city. It coöperates with conventions, to the extent of arranging\r\nspecial travel facilities. Such aids as it affords to the directors\r\nof children’s camps at the Grand Central Station are especially\r\nconspicuous for their dramatic effect on the general public.\r\n\r\nEven a service which is in a large measure non-competitive must\r\ncontinually “sell” itself to the public, as evidenced by the strenuous\r\nefforts of the New York subways and elevated lines to keep themselves\r\nconstantly before the people in the most favorable possible aspect. The\r\nsubways strive in this regard to create a feeling of submissiveness\r\ntoward inconveniences which are more or less unavoidable, and they\r\nstrive likewise to fulfill such constructive programs as that of\r\nextending traffic on less frequented lines.\r\n\r\nLet us analyze, for example, the activities of the health departments\r\nof such large cities as New York. Of recent years, Health Commissioner\r\nRoyal S. Copeland and his statements have formed a fairly regular part\r\nof the day’s news. Publicity is, in fact, one of the major functions of\r\nthe Health Department, inasmuch as its constructive work depends to a\r\nconsiderable extent upon the public education it provides in combating\r\nevils and in building up a spirit of individual and group coöperation\r\nin all health matters. When the Health Department recognizes that such\r\ndiseases as cancer, tuberculosis and those following malnutrition\r\nare due generally to ignorance or neglect and that amelioration or\r\nprevention will be the result of knowledge, it is the next logical step\r\nfor this department to devote strenuous efforts to its public relations\r\ncampaign. The department accordingly does exactly this.\r\n\r\nEven governments to-day act upon the principle that it is not\r\nsufficient to govern their own citizens well and to assure the people\r\nthat they are acting whole-heartedly in their behalf. They understand\r\nthat the public opinion of the entire world is important to their\r\nwelfare. Thus Lithuania, already noted, while it had the unbounded love\r\nand support of its own people, was nevertheless in danger of extinction\r\nbecause it was unknown outside of the immediate boundaries of those\r\nnations which had a personal interest in it. Lithuania was wanted by\r\nPoland; it was wanted by Russia. It was ignored by other nations.\r\nTherefore, through the aid of a public relations expert, Lithuania\r\nissued pamphlets, it paraded, it figured in pictures and motion\r\npictures and developed a favorable sentiment throughout the world that\r\nin the end gave Lithuania its freedom.\r\n\r\nIn industry and business, of course, there is another consideration\r\nof first-rate importance, besides the danger of interference by the\r\npublic in the conduct of the industry--the increasing intensity of\r\ncompetition. Business and sales are no longer to be had, if ever\r\nthey were to be had for the asking. It must be clear to any one who\r\nhas looked through the mass of advertising in street cars, subways,\r\nnewspapers and magazines, and the other avenues of approach to the\r\npublic, that products and services press hard upon one another in the\r\neffort to focus public attention on their offerings and to induce\r\nfavorable action.\r\n\r\nThe keen competition in the selling of products for public favor makes\r\nit imperative that the seller consider other things than merely his\r\nproduct in trying to build up a favorable public reaction. He must\r\neither himself appraise the public mind and his relation to it or he\r\nmust engage the services of an expert who can aid him to do this. He\r\nmay to-day consider, for instance, in his sales campaign, not only the\r\nquality of his soap but the working conditions, the hours of labor,\r\neven the living conditions of the men who make it.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel must advise him on these factors as well\r\nas on their presentation to the public most interested in them.\r\n\r\nIn this state of affairs it is not at all surprising that industrial\r\nleaders should give the closest attention to public relations in both\r\nthe broadest and the most practical concept of the term.\r\n\r\nLarge industrial groups, in their associations, have assigned a\r\ndefinite place to public relations bureaus.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Association Executives in New York, an association of\r\nindividual executives of state, territorial or national trade\r\nassociations, such as the Allied Wall Paper Industry, the American\r\nHardware Manufacturers’ Association, the American Protective Tariff\r\nLeague, the Atlantic Coast Shipbuilders’ Association, the National\r\nAssociation of Credit Men, the Silk Association of America and some\r\nseventy-four others, includes among its associations’ functions such\r\nactivities as the following: coöperative advertising; adjustments and\r\ncollections; cost accounting; a credit bureau; distribution and new\r\nmarkets; educational, standardization and research work; exhibits; a\r\nforeign trade bureau; house organs; general publicity; an industrial\r\nbureau; legislative work; legal aid; market reports; statistics; a\r\ntraffic department; Washington representation; arbitration. It is\r\nnoteworthy that forty of these associations have incorporated public\r\nrelations with general publicity as a definite part of their program in\r\nfurthering the interests of their organizations.\r\n\r\nThe American Telephone and Telegraph Company devotes effort to studying\r\nits public relations problems, not only to increase its volume of\r\nbusiness, but also to create a coöperative spirit between itself and\r\nthe public. The work of the telephone company’s operators, statistics,\r\ncalls, lineage, installations are given to the public in various forms.\r\nDuring the war and for a period afterwards its main problem was that of\r\nsatisfying the public that its service was necessarily below standard\r\nbecause of the peculiar national conditions. The public, in response to\r\nthe efforts of the company, which were analogous to a gracious personal\r\napology, accepted more or less irksome conditions as a matter of\r\ncourse. Had the company not cared about the public, the public would\r\nundoubtedly have been unpleasantly insistent upon a maintenance of the\r\npre-war standards of service.\r\n\r\nAmericans were once wont to jest about the dependence of France and\r\nSwitzerland upon the tourist trade. To-day we see American cities\r\ncompeting, as part of their public relations programs, for conventions,\r\nfairs and conferences. The _New York Times_ printed some time ago\r\nan address by the governor of Nebraska, in which he told a group of\r\nadvertising men that publicity had made Nebraska prosper.\r\n\r\nThe _New York Herald_ carried an editorial recently, entitled, “It\r\npays a state to advertise,” centering about the campaign of the state\r\nof Vermont to present itself favorably to public attention. According\r\nto the editorial, the state publishes a magazine, _The Vermonter_,\r\nan attractive publication filled with interesting illustrations and\r\nwell-written text. It is devoted exclusively to revealing in detail the\r\nindustrial and agricultural resources of the state and to presenting\r\nVermont’s strikingly beautiful scenic attractions for the summer\r\nvisitor. Similar instances of elaborate efforts, taking the form of\r\naction or the printed word, either to obtain public attention or to\r\nobtain a favorable attitude from the public for individual industries\r\nand groups of industries, will come readily to the reader’s mind.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to take too seriously an amusing story printed\r\nin a recent issue of a New York newspaper, leaders in movements\r\nand industries of modern life will be inclined to agree with the\r\nprotagonist of publicity spoken of. According to the story, a man set\r\nout to prove to another that it was not so much what a man did as\r\nthe way it was heralded which insures his place in history. He cited\r\nBarbara Frietchie, Evangeline, John Smith and a half dozen others as\r\ninstances to prove that they are remembered not for what they did, but\r\nbecause they had excellent counsel on their public relations.\r\n\r\n“‘Very good,’ agreed the friend. ‘But show me a case where a person who\r\nhas really done a big thing has been overlooked.’\r\n\r\n“‘You know Paul Revere, of course,’ he said. ‘But tell me the names of\r\nthe two other fellows who rode that night to rouse the countryside with\r\nthe news that the British were coming.’\r\n\r\n“‘Never heard of them,’ was the answer.\r\n\r\n“‘There were three waiting to see the signal hung in the tower of the\r\nOld North Church,’ he said. ‘Every one of them was mounted and spurred,\r\njust as Mr. Longfellow described Paul Revere. They all got the signal.\r\nThey all rode and waked the farmers, spreading the warning. Afterward\r\none of them was an officer in Washington’s army, another became\r\ngovernor of one of the States. Not one in twenty thousand Americans\r\never heard the names of the other two, and there is hardly a person in\r\nAmerica who does not know all about Revere.’\r\n\r\n“‘Did Revere make history or did Longfellow?’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE FUNCTION OF A SPECIAL PLEADER\r\n\r\n\r\nPublic opinion has entered life at many points as a decisive factor.\r\nMen and movements whose interests will be affected by the attitude of\r\nthe public are taking pains to have themselves represented in the court\r\nof public opinion by the most skillful counselors they can obtain. The\r\nbusiness of the public relations counsel is somewhat like the business\r\nof the attorney--to advise his client and to litigate his causes for\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhile the special pleader in law, the lawyer for the defense, has\r\nalways been accorded a formal hearing by judge and jury, this has not\r\nbeen the case before the court of public opinion. Here mob psychology,\r\nthe intolerance of human society for a dissenting point of view, have\r\nmade it difficult and often dangerous for a man to plead for a new or\r\nunpopular cause.\r\n\r\n_The Fourth Estate_, a newspaper for the makers of newspapers, says:\r\n“‘Counsel on public relations’ and ‘director of public relations’ are\r\ntwo terms that are being encountered more often every day. There is a\r\nfamiliar tinge to them, in a way, but in justice to the men who bear\r\nthese titles and to the concerns which employ them, it should be said\r\nthat they are--or can be--dissociated from the old idea of ‘publicity\r\nman.’ The very fact that many of the largest corporations in the\r\ncountry are recognizing the need of maintaining right relationships\r\nwith the public is alone important enough to assure a fair and even\r\nfavorable hearing for their public relations departments.\r\n\r\n“Whether a man is really entitled to the appellation ‘counsel on public\r\nrelations’ or whether he should merely be called ‘publicity man’ rests\r\nentirely with the individual and the firm that employs him. As we see\r\nit, a man who is really counsel or director of public relations has one\r\nof the most important jobs on the roster of any concern; but a man who\r\nmerely represents the old idea of getting something for nothing from\r\npublishers is about _passé_....\r\n\r\n“So there is made plain the difference between two terms, the old and\r\nthe new, both of which have occasioned much natural curiosity among\r\nnewspaper men. When Napoleon said, ‘Circumstance? I make circumstance,’\r\nhe expressed very nearly the spirit of the public relations counsel’s\r\nwork. So long as this new professional branch live up to the\r\npossibilities that their title suggests, they are bound to accomplish\r\ngeneral constructive good. Maybe they, at last, will make us forget\r\nthat ingratiating though insidious individual, the publicity man.”\r\n\r\nAs indicative perhaps of the growing importance of the profession, an\r\narticle by Mary Swain Routzahn, in charge of the Department of Surveys\r\nand Exhibits of the Russell Sage Foundation, on “Woman’s Chance as\r\nPublicity Specialist” published in the _New York Globe_ of August 2nd,\r\n1921, discusses the profession as one of recent development, but of\r\nsuch importance as to deserve the serious consideration of women who\r\nare interested in making a professional career for themselves.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel is first of all a student. His field\r\nof study is the public mind. His text books for this study are the\r\nfacts of life; the articles printed in newspapers and magazines, the\r\nadvertisements that are inserted in publications, the billboards that\r\nline the streets, the railroads and the highways, the speeches that are\r\ndelivered in legislative chambers, the sermons issuing from pulpits,\r\nanecdotes related in smoking rooms, the gossip of Wall Street, the\r\npatter of the theater and the conversation of other men who, like him,\r\nare interpreters and must listen for the clear or obscure enunciations\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nHe brings the talent of his intuitive understanding to the aid of his\r\npractical and psychological tests and surveys. But he is not only a\r\nstudent. He is a practitioner with a wide range of instruments and a\r\ndefinite technique for their use.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there are the circumstances and events he helps to\r\ncreate. After that there are the instruments by which he broadcasts\r\nfacts and ideas to the public; advertising, motion pictures, circular\r\nletters, booklets, handbills, speeches, meetings, parades, news\r\narticles, magazine articles and whatever other mediums there are\r\nthrough which public attention is reached and influenced.\r\n\r\nNow sensitiveness to the state of mind of the public is a difficult\r\nthing to achieve or maintain. Any man can tell you with more or less\r\naccuracy and clearness his own reactions on any particular issue. But\r\nfew men have the time or the interest or the training to develop a\r\nsense of what other persons think or feel about the same issue. In his\r\nown profession the skilled practitioner is sensitive and understanding.\r\nThe lawyer can tell what argument will appeal to court or jury. The\r\nsalesman can tell what points to stress to his prospective buyers. The\r\npolitician can tell what to emphasize to his audience, but the ability\r\nto estimate group reactions on a large scale over a wide geographic\r\nand psychological area is a specialized ability which must be developed\r\nwith the same painstaking self-criticism and with the same dependence\r\non experience that are required for the development of the clinical\r\nsense in the doctor or surgeon.\r\n\r\nOf course, the public relations counsel employs all those practical\r\nmeans of gauging the public mind which modern advertising has developed\r\nand uses. He employs the research campaign, the symposium, the survey\r\nof a particular group or of a particular state of mind as a further\r\naid, and confirmation or modification of his own appraisals and\r\njudgments.\r\n\r\nCharles J. Rosebault, the author of an article in the _New York Times_\r\nrecently, headed “Men Who Wield the Spotlight,” remarks that the\r\ncompetent public relations counsel has generally had some newspaper\r\ntraining and that the value of this training “is a keen sense of the\r\nlikes and dislikes of what we call the public--that is, the average\r\nof men and women. The needle of the compass is no more sensitive to\r\ndirection, nor the mercury in the thermometer to variations of heat and\r\ncold than is this expert to the influence of publicity upon the mind\r\nand emotions of the man in the street.”\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the growing interest of the public in men\r\nand movements should have led to the spontaneous creation of the new\r\nprofession.\r\n\r\nWe have presented here, in very broad outline, a picture of the\r\nfundamental work of the public relations counsel and of the fundamental\r\nconditions which have produced him. On the one hand, a complex\r\nenvironment of which only small, disconnected portions are available\r\nto different persons; on the other hand, the great and increasing\r\nimportance either of making one’s case accessible to the public mind or\r\nof determining whether that case will impinge favorably or unfavorably\r\nupon the public mind--these two conditions, taken together, have\r\nresulted inevitably in the public relations counsel. Mr. Lippmann finds\r\nin these facts the underlying reason for the existence of what he calls\r\nthe “press agent.” “The enormous discretion,” he says, “as to what\r\nfacts and what impressions shall be reported is steadily convincing\r\nevery organized group of people that, whether it wishes to secure\r\npublicity or to avoid it, the exercise of discretion cannot be left to\r\nthe reporter. It is safer to hire a press agent who stands between the\r\ngroup and the newspapers.”[3]\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the popular impression of the scope and functions\r\nof the counsel on public relations must be radically revised if any\r\naccurate picture of the profession is to be looked for. The public\r\nrelations counsel is the lineal descendant, to be sure, of the\r\ncircus advance-man and of the semi-journalist promoter of small-part\r\nactresses. The economic conditions which have produced him, however,\r\nand made his profession the important one it is to-day, have in\r\nthemselves materially changed the character of his work.\r\n\r\nHis primary function now is not to bring his clients by chance to the\r\npublic’s attention, nor to extricate them from difficulties into which\r\nthey have already drifted, but to advise his clients how positive\r\nresults can be accomplished in the field of public relations and to\r\nkeep them from drifting inadvertently into unfortunate or harmful\r\nsituations. The public relations counsel will find that the conditions\r\nunder which his client operates, be it a government, a manufacturer of\r\nfood products or a railroad system, are constantly changing and that he\r\nmust advise modifications in policy in accordance with such changes in\r\nthe public point of view. As such, the public relations counsel must be\r\nalive to the events of the day--not only the events that are printed\r\nbut the events which are forming hour by hour, as reported in the words\r\nthat are spoken on the street, in the smoking cars, in the school room,\r\nor expressed in any of the other forms of thought communication that\r\nmake up public opinion.\r\n\r\nSo long as the press remains the greatest single medium for reaching\r\nthe public mind, the work of the public relations counsel will\r\nnecessarily have close contacts with the work of the journalist. He\r\ntransmits his ideas, however, through all those mediums which help to\r\nbuild public opinion--the radio, the lecture platform, advertising, the\r\nstage, the motion picture, the mails. On the other hand, he is becoming\r\nto-day as much of an adviser on actions as he is the communicator of\r\nthese actions to the public.\r\n\r\nThe public relations consultant is ideally a constructive force in the\r\ncommunity. The results of his work are often accelerated interest in\r\nmatters of value and importance to the social, economic or political\r\nlife of the community.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel is the pleader to the public of a point\r\nof view. He acts in this capacity as a consultant both in interpreting\r\nthe public to his client and in helping to interpret his client to the\r\npublic. He helps to mould the action of his client as well as to mould\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nHis profession is in a state of evolution. His future must depend as\r\nmuch upon the growing realization by the public of the responsibility\r\nto the public of individuals, institutions and organizations as upon\r\nthe public relations counsel’s own realization of the importance of his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II\r\n\r\nTHE GROUP AND HERD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nWHAT CONSTITUTES PUBLIC OPINION?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character and origins of public opinion, the factors that make\r\nup the individual mind and the group mind must be understood if the\r\nprofession of public relations counsel is to be intelligently practiced\r\nand its functions and possibilities accurately estimated. Society must\r\nunderstand the fundamental character of the work he is doing, if for no\r\nother reason than its own welfare.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel works with that vague, little-understood,\r\nindefinite material called public opinion.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is a term describing an ill-defined, mercurial\r\nand changeable group of individual judgments. Public opinion is\r\nthe aggregate result of individual opinions--now uniform, now\r\nconflicting--of the men and women who make up society or any group of\r\nsociety. In order to understand public opinion, one must go back to the\r\nindividual who makes up the group.\r\n\r\nThe mental equipment of the average individual consists of a mass of\r\njudgments on most of the subjects which touch his daily physical or\r\nmental life. These judgments are the tools of his daily being and\r\nyet they are his judgments, not on a basis of research and logical\r\ndeduction, but for the most part dogmatic expressions accepted on the\r\nauthority of his parents, his teachers, his church, and of his social,\r\nhis economic and other leaders.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel must understand the social implications\r\nof an individual’s thoughts and actions. Is it, for example, purely an\r\naccident that a man belongs to one church rather than another or to any\r\nchurch at all? Is it an accident that makes Boston women prefer brown\r\neggs and New York women white eggs? What are the factors that work in\r\nfavor of conversion of a man from one political party to another or\r\nfrom one type of food to another?\r\n\r\nWhy do certain communities resist the prohibition law--why do others\r\nabide by it? Why is it difficult to start a new party movement--or to\r\nfight cancer? Why is it difficult to fight for sex education? Why does\r\nthe free trader denounce protectionism, and vice versa?\r\n\r\nIf we had to form our own judgments on every matter, we should all have\r\nto find out many things for ourselves which we now take for granted. We\r\nshould not cook our food or live in houses--in fact, we should revert\r\nto primitive living.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel must deal with the fact that persons who\r\nhave little knowledge of a subject almost invariably form definite and\r\npositive judgments upon that subject.\r\n\r\n“If we examine the mental furniture of the average man,” says William\r\nTrotter, the author of a comprehensive study of the social psychology\r\nof the individual,[4] “we shall find it made up of a vast number of\r\njudgments of a very precise kind upon subjects of very great variety,\r\ncomplexity, and difficulty. He will have fairly settled views upon the\r\norigin and nature of the universe, and upon what he will probably call\r\nits meaning; he will have conclusions as to what is to happen to him at\r\ndeath and after, as to what is and what should be the basis of conduct.\r\nHe will know how the country should be governed, and why it is going\r\nto the dogs, why this piece of legislation is good and that bad. He\r\nwill have strong views upon military and naval strategy, the principles\r\nof taxation, the use of alcohol and vaccination, the treatment of\r\ninfluenza, the prevention of hydrophobia, upon municipal trading, the\r\nteaching of Greek, upon what is permissible in art, satisfactory in\r\nliterature, and hopeful in science.\r\n\r\n“The bulk of such opinions must necessarily be without rational\r\nbasis, since many of them are concerned with problems admitted by the\r\nexpert to be still unsolved, while as to the rest it is clear that the\r\ntraining and experience of no average man can qualify him to have any\r\nopinion upon them at all. The rational method adequately used would\r\nhave told him that on the great majority of these questions there could\r\nbe for him but one attitude--that of suspended judgment.”\r\n\r\nThe reader will recall from his own experience an almost infinite\r\nnumber of instances in which the amateur has been fully prepared to\r\ndeliver expert advice and to give final judgment in matters upon which\r\nhis ignorance is patent to every one except himself.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle Ages, society was convinced that there were witches.\r\nPeople were so positive that they burned people whom they suspected\r\nof witchcraft. To-day there is an equal number of people who believe\r\njust as firmly, one way or the other, about spiritualism and spirits.\r\nThey do not burn mediums. But people who have made no research of the\r\nsubject pass strong denunciatory judgments. Others, no better informed,\r\nconsider mediums divinely inspired. Not so long ago every intelligent\r\nman knew that the world was flat. To-day the average man has a belief\r\njust as firm and unknowing in the mysterious force which he has heard\r\ncalled atomic energy.\r\n\r\nIt is axiomatic that men who know little are often intolerant of a\r\npoint of view that is contrary to their own. The bitterness that has\r\nbeen brought about by arguments on public questions is proverbial.\r\nLovers have been parted by bitter quarrels on theories of pacificism\r\nor militarism; and when an argument upon an abstract question engages\r\nopponents they often desert the main line of argument in order to abuse\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nHow often this is true can be seen from the congressional records of\r\ncontroversies in which the personal attack supersedes logic. In a\r\nrecent fight against the proposed tariff measures, a protagonist of\r\nprotection published long vindictive statements, in which he tried to\r\nconfound the character and the disinterestedness of his opponents.\r\nLogically his discussion should have been based only upon the sound\r\neconomic, social and political value of the bill as presented.\r\n\r\nA hundred leading American bankers, business men, professional men and\r\neconomists united in public disapproval of this plan. They stated their\r\nopinion that the “American” Valuation Plan, as it was called, would\r\nendanger the prosperity of the country, that it would be inimical to\r\nour foreign relations and that it would injure the welfare of every\r\ncountry with whom our commercial and industrial ties were at all\r\nclose. This group was a broadly representative group of men and women,\r\nyet the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee accused all these\r\npeople of acting upon motives of personal gain and lack of patriotism.\r\nPrejudice superseded logic.\r\n\r\nIntolerance is almost inevitably accompanied by a natural and true\r\ninability to comprehend or make allowance for opposite points of view.\r\nThe skilled scientist who may be receptive to any promising suggestion\r\nin his own field may outside of his own field be found quite unwilling\r\nto make any attempt at understanding a point of view contrary to his\r\nown. In politics, for example, his understanding of the problem may\r\nbe fragmentary, yet he will enter excitedly into discussions on bonus\r\nand ship subsidy, of which he has made no study. We find here with\r\nsignificant uniformity what one psychologist has called “logic-proof\r\ncompartments.”\r\n\r\nThe logic-proof compartment has always been with us. Scientists have\r\nlost their lives through refusing to see flaws in their theories.\r\nIntelligent mothers give food to their babies that they would\r\nmanifestly forbid other mothers to give their children. Especially\r\nsignificant is the tendency of races to maintain religious beliefs\r\nand customs long after these have lost their meaning. Dietary laws,\r\nhygienic laws, even laws based upon geographical conditions that have\r\nbeen changed for more than a thousand years are still maintained in the\r\nlogic-proof compartment of dogmatic adherence. There is a story that\r\ncertain missionaries give money to heathen at the time of conversion\r\nand that the heathen, having got their money, bathe away their\r\nconversion in sacred streams.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of the human mind to adhere to its beliefs is\r\nexcellently summarized in the volume by Mr. Trotter to which reference\r\nhas been made before. “It is clear,” says Mr. Trotter,[5] “at the\r\noutset that these beliefs are invariably regarded as rational and\r\ndefended as such, while the position of one who holds contrary views is\r\nheld to be obviously unreasonable.\r\n\r\n“The religious man accuses the atheist of being shallow and irrational,\r\nand is met by a similar reply. To the Conservative the amazing thing\r\nabout the Liberal is his incapacity to see reason and accept the\r\nonly possible solution of public problems. Examination reveals the\r\nfact that the differences are not due to the commission of the mere\r\nmechanical fallacies of logic, since these are easily avoided, even by\r\nthe politician, and since there is no reason to believe that one party\r\nin such controversies is less logical than the other. The difference\r\nis due rather to the fundamental assumptions of the antagonists being\r\nhostile, and these assumptions are derived from herd-suggestions;\r\nto the Liberal certain basal conceptions have acquired the quality\r\nof instinctive truth, have become _a priori_ syntheses, because of\r\nthe accumulated suggestions to which he has been exposed; and a\r\nsimilar explanation applies to the atheist, the Christian, and the\r\nConservative. Each, it is important to remember, finds in consequence\r\nthe rationality of his position flawless and is quite incapable of\r\ndetecting in it the fallacies which are obvious to his opponent, to\r\nwhom that particular series of assumptions has not been rendered\r\nacceptable by herd suggestion.”\r\n\r\nThus the public relations counsel has to consider the _a priori_\r\njudgment of any public he deals with before counseling any step that\r\nwould modify those things in which the public has an established belief.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom effective to call names or to attempt to discredit the\r\nbeliefs themselves. The counsel on public relations, after examination\r\nof the sources of established beliefs, must either discredit the old\r\nauthorities or create new authorities by making articulate a mass\r\nopinion against the old belief or in favor of the new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nIS PUBLIC OPINION STUBBORN OR MALLEABLE?\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a divergence of opinion as to whether the public mind is\r\nmalleable or stubborn--whether it is a passive or an active element.\r\nOn the one hand is the profound belief that “you can’t change human\r\nnature.” On the other hand is the equally firm assurance that certain\r\nwell-defined institutions modify and alter public opinion.\r\n\r\nThere is a uniformity of opinion in this country upon many issues.\r\nWhen this uniformity accords with our own beliefs we call it an\r\nexpression of the public conscience. When, however, it runs contrary\r\nto our beliefs we call it the regimentation of the public mind and are\r\ninclined to ascribe it to insidious propaganda.\r\n\r\nUniformity is, in fact, largely natural and only partly artificial.\r\nPublic opinion may be as much the producer of “insidious propaganda”\r\nas its product. Naturally enough, where broad ideas are involved,\r\ncriticisms of the state of the public’s mind and of its origin come\r\nmost frequently from groups that are out of sympathy with the accepted\r\npoint of view. They find the public unreceptive to their point of\r\nview, and justly or unjustly they attribute this to the influence of\r\nantagonistic interests upon the public mind.\r\n\r\nThese groups see the press, the lecture platform, the schools, the\r\nadvertisements, the churches, the radio, the motion picture screen,\r\nthe magazines daily reaching millions. They see that the preponderant\r\npoint of view in most, if not all, these institutions conforms to the\r\npreponderant state of mind of the public.\r\n\r\nThey argue from the one to the other and reach their conclusions\r\nwithout much difficulty. They do not stop to think that agreement in\r\npoint of view between the public and these institutions may often be\r\nthe result of the control exercised by the public mind over these\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nMany outside forces, however, do go to influence public opinion. The\r\nmost obvious of these forces are parental influence, the school room,\r\nthe press, motion pictures, advertising, magazines, lectures, the\r\nchurch, the radio.\r\n\r\nTo answer the question as to the stubbornness or malleability of the\r\npublic, let us analyze the press in its relation to public opinion,\r\nsince the press stands preëminent among the various institutions which\r\nare commonly designated as leaders or moulders of the public mind. By\r\nthe press, in this instance, I mean the daily press. Americans are\r\na newspaper-reading public. They have become accustomed to look to\r\ntheir morning and evening papers for the news of the world and for\r\nthe opinions of their leaders. And while the individual newspaper\r\nreader does not give a very considerable portion of his day to this\r\noccupation, many persons find time to read more than one newspaper\r\nevery day.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that the man who is outside the current of\r\nprevailing public opinion should regard the daily press as a coercive\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nDiscussions of the public’s reaction to the press are two-sided, just\r\nas are discussions of the influence of the pulpit or other forces.\r\nSome authorities hold that the public mind is stubborn in regard to\r\nthe press and that the press has little influence upon it. There are\r\ngraphic instances of the stubbornness of the public point of view.\r\nA most interesting example is the reëlection of Mayor Hylan of New\r\nYork by an overwhelming majority in the face of the opposition of all\r\nbut two of the metropolitan dailies. It is also noteworthy that in\r\n1909, Gaynor was elected Mayor of New York with every paper except\r\none opposing his candidacy. Likewise, Mayor Mitchel of New York was\r\ndefeated for reëlection in 1917, although all the New York papers\r\nexcept two Hearst papers and the _New York Call_ supported him. In\r\nBoston, in a recent election, a man was elected as mayor who had\r\nbeen convicted of a penal offense, and elected in the face of the\r\npractically united opposition of all the newspapers of that city.\r\nHow would such authors as Everett Dean Martin, Walter Lippmann and\r\nUpton Sinclair explain these incidents? How, on the theory of the\r\nregimentation of the public mind by the daily press, can such thinkers\r\nexplain the sharpness with which the public sometimes rejects the\r\nadvocacies of a united press? These instances are not frequent; but\r\nthey show that other influences beside the press enter into the making\r\nof a public opinion and that these forces must never be disregarded in\r\nthe estimate of the quality and stability of a prevalent public opinion.\r\n\r\nFrancis E. Leupp, writing in the _Atlantic Monthly_ for February,\r\n1910, on “The Waning Power of the Press,” remarks that Mayor Gaynor’s\r\ncomments shortly after his election in 1909 “led up to the conclusion\r\nthat in our common sense generation nobody cares what the newspapers\r\nsay.” Mr. Leupp continues: “Unflattering as such a verdict may be,\r\nprobably the majority of a community if polled as a jury would concur\r\nin it. The airy dismissal of some proposition as ‘mere newspaper talk’\r\nis heard at every social gathering until one who is brought up to\r\nregard the press as a mighty factor in modern civilization is tempted\r\nto wonder whether it has actually lost the power it used to wield among\r\nus.”\r\n\r\nAnd H. L. Mencken, writing in the same magazine for March, 1914,\r\ndeclares that “one of the principal marks of an educated man, indeed,\r\nis the fact that he does _not_ take his opinions from newspapers--not,\r\nat any rate, from the militant, crusading newspapers. On the contrary,\r\nhis attitude toward them is almost always one of frank cynicism, with\r\nindifference as its mildest form and contempt as its commonest. He\r\nknows that they are constantly falling into false reasoning about the\r\nthings within his personal knowledge,--that is, within the narrow\r\ncircle of his special education,--and so he assumes that they make the\r\nsame, or even worse, errors about other things, whether intellectual or\r\nmoral. This assumption, it may be said at once, is quite justified by\r\nthe facts.”\r\n\r\nThe second point of view holds that the daily press and the other\r\nleading forces merely accept, reflect and intensify established public\r\nopinion and are, therefore, responsible for the uniformity of public\r\nreaction. A vivid statement of the point of view of the man who\r\ntypifies this group is found in Everett Dean Martin’s volume on “The\r\nBehavior of Crowds.” He says:[6] “The modern man has in the printing\r\npress a wonderfully effective means for perpetuating crowd-movements\r\nand keeping great masses of people constantly under the sway of certain\r\ncrowd-ideas. Every crowd-group has its magazines, press agents, and\r\nspecial ‘literature’ with which it continually harangues its members\r\nand possible converts. Many books, and especially certain works of\r\nfiction of the ‘best seller’ type, are clearly reading mob phenomena.”\r\n\r\nThere is a third group which perhaps comes nearer the truth,\r\nwhich holds that the press, just as other mediums of education or\r\ndissemination, brings about a very definite change in public opinion.\r\nA most graphic illustration of what such mediums can do to change\r\nopinions upon fundamental and important matters is the woman suffrage\r\nquestion and its victory over established points of view. The press,\r\nthe pulpit, the lecture platform, the motion pictures and the other\r\nmediums for reaching the public brought about a complete popular\r\nconversion. Other examples of the change that may be brought about in\r\npublic opinion in this way, by such institutions of authority, is the\r\npresent attitude towards birth control and towards health education.\r\n\r\nNaturally the press, like other institutions which present facts or\r\nopinions, is restricted, often unconsciously, sometimes consciously, by\r\nvarious controlling conditions. Certain people talk of the censorship\r\nenacted by the prejudices and predispositions of the public itself.\r\nSome, such as Upton Sinclair, ascribe to the advertisers a conscious\r\nand powerful control of publications. Others, like Walter Lippmann,\r\nfind that an effective barrier between the public and the event exists\r\nin the powerful influence which, he says, is exerted in certain cases\r\non the press by the so-called quality public which the newspapers’\r\nadvertisers wish to reach and among whom the newspapers must circulate\r\nif the advertising is to be successful. Mr. Lippmann observes that\r\nalthough such a restriction may exist, much of what may be attributed\r\nto censorship in the newspaper, often is actually inadequate\r\npresentation of the events it seeks to describe.\r\n\r\nOn this point he says:[7] “It follows that in the reporting of strikes,\r\nthe easiest way is to let the news be uncovered by the overt act, and\r\nto describe the event as the story of interference with the reader’s\r\nlife. This is where his attention is first aroused and his interest\r\nmost easily enlisted. A great deal, I think myself, of the crucial\r\npart of what looks to the worker and the reformer as deliberate\r\nmisrepresentation on the part of newspapers, is the direct outcome\r\nof a practical difficulty in uncovering the news, and the emotional\r\ndifficulty of making distinct facts interesting unless, as Emerson\r\nsays, we can ‘perceive’ (them) and can ‘set about translating (them) at\r\nonce into parallel facts.’”\r\n\r\nIn view then of the possibility of a malleable public opinion the\r\ncounsel on public relations, desiring to obtain a hearing for any given\r\ncause, simply utilizes existent channels to obtain expression for the\r\npoint of view he represents. How this is done will be considered later.\r\n\r\nBecause of the importance of channels of thought communication, it\r\nis vital for the public relations counsel to study carefully the\r\nrelationship between public opinion and the organs that maintain it or\r\nthat influence it to change. We shall look into this interaction and\r\nits effect in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE INTERACTION OF PUBLIC OPINION WITH THE FORCES THAT HELP TO MAKE IT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public and the press, or for that matter, the public and any force\r\nthat modifies public opinion, interact. Action and interaction are\r\ncontinually going on between the forces projected out to the public\r\nand the public itself. The public relations counsel must understand\r\nthis fact in its broadest and most detailed implications. He must\r\nunderstand not only what these various forces are, but he must be able\r\nto evaluate their relative powers with fair accuracy. Let us consider\r\nagain the case of a newspaper, as representative of other mediums of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\n“We print,” says the _New York Times_, “all the news that’s fit to\r\nprint.” Immediately the question arises (as Elmer Davis, the historian\r\nof the _Times_ tells us that it did when the motto was first adopted)\r\nwhat news _is_ fit to print? By what standard is the editorial decision\r\nreached which includes one kind of news and excludes another kind? The\r\n_Times_ itself has not been, in its long and conspicuously successful\r\ncareer, entirely free from difficulties on this point.\r\n\r\nThus in “The History of The _New York Times_,” Mr. Davis feels the\r\nneed for justifying the extent to which that paper featured Theodore\r\nTilton’s action against the Rev. Henry Ward Beecher for alienation\r\nof Mrs. Tilton’s affections and his conduct with her. Mr. Davis says\r\n(pages 124-125): “No doubt a good many readers of the _Times_ thought\r\nthat the paper was giving an undue amount of space to this chronicle\r\nof sin and suffering. Those complaints come in often enough even in\r\nthese days from readers who appreciate the paper’s general reluctance\r\nto display news of this sort, and wonder why a good general rule\r\nshould occasionally be violated. But there was a reason in the Beecher\r\ncase, as there has usually been a reason in similar affairs since.\r\nDr. Beecher was one of the most prominent clergymen in the country;\r\nthere was a natural curiosity as to whether he was practicing what\r\nhe preached. One of the counsel at the trial declared that ‘all\r\nChristendom was hanging on its outcome.’ Full reporting of its course\r\nwas not a mere pandering to vulgar curiosity, but a recognition of the\r\nvalue of the case as news.”\r\n\r\nThe simple fact that such a slogan can exist and be accepted is for\r\nour purpose an important point. Somewhere there must be a standard\r\nto which the editors of the _Times_ can conform, as well as a large\r\nclientele of constant readers to whom that standard is satisfactory.\r\n“Fit” must be defined by the editors of the _Times_ in a way which\r\nmeets with the approval of enough persons to enable the paper to\r\nmaintain its reading public. As soon, however, as the definition is\r\nattempted, difficulties arise.\r\n\r\nProfessor W. G. Bleyer, in an article in his book on journalism,\r\nfirst stresses the importance of completeness in the news columns of\r\na paper, then goes on to say that “the only important limitations\r\nto completeness are those imposed by the commonly accepted ideas of\r\ndecency embodied in the words, ‘All the news that’s fit to print’ and\r\nby the rights of privacy. Carefully edited newspapers discriminate\r\nbetween what the public is entitled to know and what an individual has\r\na right to keep private.”\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when Professor Bleyer attempts to define what\r\nnews is fit to print and what the public is entitled to know, he\r\ndiscusses generalizations capable of wide and frequently inconsistent\r\ninterpretation. “News,” says he, “is anything timely which is\r\nsignificant to newspaper readers in their relations to the community,\r\nthe state and the nation.”\r\n\r\nWho is to determine what is significant and what is not? Who is\r\nto decide which of the individual’s relations to the community\r\nare safeguarded by his right of privacy and which are not? Such a\r\ndefinition tells us nothing more definite than does the slogan which it\r\nattempts to define. We must look further for a standard by which these\r\ndefinitions are applied. There must be a consensus of public opinion on\r\nwhich the newspaper falls back for its standards.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that while it appears to be forming the public opinion on\r\nfundamental matters, the press is often conforming to it.\r\n\r\nIt is the office of the public relations counsel to determine the\r\ninteraction between the public, and the press and the other mediums\r\naffecting public opinion. It is as important to conform to the\r\nstandards of the organ which projects ideas as it is to present to\r\nthis organ such ideas as will conform to the fundamental understanding\r\nand appreciation of the public to which they are ultimately to appeal.\r\nThere is as much truth in the proposition that the public leads\r\ninstitutions as in the contrary proposition that the institutions lead\r\nthe public.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the manner in which newspapers are inclined to\r\naccept the judgments of their readers in presenting material to them,\r\nwe have this anecdote which Rollo Ogden tells in the _Atlantic Monthly_\r\nfor July, 1906, about a letter which Wendell Phillips wished to have\r\npublished in a Boston paper.\r\n\r\n“The editor read it over, and said, ‘Mr. Phillips, that is a very good\r\nand interesting letter, and I shall be glad to publish it; but I wish\r\nyou would consent to strike out the last paragraph.’\r\n\r\n“‘Why,’ said Phillips, ‘that paragraph is the precise thing for which I\r\nwrote the whole letter. Without that it would be pointless.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, I see that,’ replied the editor; ‘and what you say is perfectly\r\ntrue! I fully agree with it all myself. Yet it is one of those things\r\nwhich it will not do to say publicly. However, if you insist upon it, I\r\nwill publish it as it stands.’\r\n\r\n“It was published the next morning, and along with it a short editorial\r\nreference to it, saying that a letter from Mr. Phillips would be found\r\nin another column, and that it was extraordinary that so keen a mind\r\nas his should have fallen into the palpable absurdity contained in the\r\nlast paragraph.”\r\n\r\nRecognition of this fact comes from a number of different sources.\r\nH. L. Mencken recognizes that the public runs the press as much as the\r\npress runs the public.\r\n\r\n“The primary aim of all of them,” says Mr. Mencken,[8] “not less\r\nwhen they play the secular Iokanaan than when they play the mere\r\nnewsmonger, was to please the crowd, and to give a good show; and the\r\nway they set about giving that good show was by first selecting a\r\ndeserving victim, and then putting him magnificently to the torture.\r\n\r\n“This was their method when they were performing for their own profit\r\nonly, when their one motive was to make the public read their paper;\r\nbut it was still their motive when they were battling bravely and\r\nunselfishly for the public good, and so discharging the highest duty of\r\ntheir profession.”\r\n\r\nThere are interesting, if somewhat obscure, examples of the\r\ncomplementary working of various forces. In the field of the motion\r\npictures, for example, the producers, the actors and the press, in\r\ntheir support, have continually waged a battle against censorship.\r\nUndoubtedly censorship of the motion pictures is in its practical\r\nworkings an economic and artistic handicap. Censorship, however, will\r\ncontinue in spite of the producers as long as there is a willingness on\r\nthe part of the public to accept this censorship. The public, on the\r\nwhole, has refused to join the fight against censorship, because there\r\nis a more or less articulate belief that children, if not women, should\r\nbe protected from seeing shocking sights, such as murders visibly\r\nenacted, the taking of drugs, immoralities and other acts which might\r\noffend or suggest harmful imitation.\r\n\r\n“Damaged Goods,” before its presentation to America in 1913, was\r\nanalyzed by the public relations counsel, who helped to produce the\r\nplay. He recognized that unless that part of the public sentiment which\r\nbelieved in education and truth could be lifted from that part of\r\npublic opinion which condemned the mentioning of sex matters, “Damaged\r\nGoods” would fail. The producers, therefore, did not try to educate the\r\npublic by presenting this play as such, but allowed group leaders and\r\ngroups interested in education to come to the support of Brieux’s drama\r\nand, in a sense, to sponsor the production.\r\n\r\nProof that the public and the institutions that make public opinion\r\ninteract is shown in instances in which books were stifled because of\r\npopular disapproval at one time and then brought forward by popular\r\ndemand at a later time when public opinion had altered. Religious and\r\nvery early scientific works are among such books.\r\n\r\nA more recent instance is the announcement made by _Judge_, a weekly\r\nmagazine, that it would support the fight for light wine and beer.\r\n_Judge_ took this stand because it believed in the principle of\r\npersonal freedom and also because it deemed that public sentiment\r\nwas in favor of light wine and beer as a substitute for absolute\r\nprohibition. _Judge_ believed its stand would please its readers.\r\n\r\nPresumably writing of newspaper morality, Mr. Mencken, in his article\r\njust quoted, finds at the end of it that he has “written of popular\r\nmorality very copiously, and of newspaper morality very little.\r\n\r\n“But,” says Mr. Mencken, “as I have said before, the one is the other.\r\nThe newspaper must adapt its pleading to its clients’ moral limitation\r\njust as the trial lawyer also must adapt _his_ pleading to the jury’s\r\nlimitations. Neither may like the job, but both must face it to gain\r\nthe larger end.”\r\n\r\nWriting on the other hand from the point of view of the man who feels\r\nthat the public taste requires no justification, Ralph Pulitzer\r\nnevertheless agrees with Mr. Mencken that the opinion of the press\r\nis set by the public; and he justifies “muckraking”[9] by finding it\r\nneither “extraordinary nor culpable that people and press should be\r\nmore interested in the polemical than in the platitudinous; in blame\r\nthan in painting the lily; in attack than in sending laudatory coals to\r\nNewcastle.”\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Leupp[10] concludes that “whatever we may say of the modern\r\npress on its less commendable side, we are bound to admit that\r\nnewspapers, like governments, fairly reflect the people they serve.\r\nCharles Dudley Warner once went so far as to say that no matter how\r\nobjectionable the character of a paper may be, it is always a trifle\r\nbetter than the patrons on whom it relies for its support.”\r\n\r\nSimilarly, from an unusually wide experience on a paper as highly\r\nconsidered, perhaps, as any in America, Rollo Ogden claims this give\r\nand take between the public and the press is vital to a just conception\r\nof American journalism.\r\n\r\n“The editor does not nonchalantly project his thoughts into the void.\r\nHe listens for the echo of his words. His relation to his supporters is\r\nnot unlike Gladstone’s definition of the intimate connection between\r\nthe orator and his audience. As the speaker gets from his hearers in\r\nmist what he gives back in shower, so the newspaper receives from the\r\npublic as well as gives to it. Too often it gets as dust what it gives\r\nback as mud; but that does not alter the relation. Action and reaction\r\nare all the while going on between the press and its patrons. Hence it\r\nfollows that the responsibility for the more crying evils of journalism\r\nmust be divided.”[11]\r\n\r\nThe same interaction goes on in connection with all the other forces\r\nthat mould public opinion. The preacher upholds the ideals of society.\r\nHe leads his flock whither they indicate a willingness to be led. Ibsen\r\ncreates a revolution when society is ripe for it. The public responds\r\nto finer music and better motion pictures and demands improvements.\r\n“Give the people what they want” is only half sound. What they want\r\nand what they get are fused by some mysterious alchemy. The press, the\r\nlecturer, the screen and the public lead and are led by each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE POWER OF INTERACTING FORCES THAT GO TO MAKE UP PUBLIC OPINION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe influence of any force which attempts to modify public opinion\r\ndepends upon the success with which it is able to enlist established\r\npoints of view. A middle ground exists between the hypothesis that\r\nthe public is stubborn and the hypothesis that it is malleable. To a\r\nlarge degree the press, the schools, the churches, motion pictures,\r\nadvertising, the lecture platform and radio all conform to the demands\r\nof the public. But to an equally large degree the public responds to\r\nthe influence of these very same mediums of communication.\r\n\r\nSome analysts believe that the public has no opinions except those\r\nwhich various institutions provide ready made for it. From Mr. Mencken\r\nand others it would almost seem to follow that newspapers and other\r\nmediums have no standards except those which the public provides, and\r\nthat therefore they are substantially without influence upon the public\r\nmind. The truth of the matter, as I have pointed out, lies somewhere\r\nbetween these two extreme positions.\r\n\r\nIn other words, the public relations counsel who thinks clearly on\r\nthe problem of public opinion and public relations will credit the\r\ntwo factors of public opinion respectively with their influence and\r\neffectiveness in mutual interaction.\r\n\r\nRay Stannard Baker says[12] that “while there was a gesture of\r\nunconcern, of don’t care what they say, on the part of the leaders (of\r\nthe Versailles conference), no aspect of the conference in reality\r\nworried them more than the news, opinions, guesses that went out by\r\nscores of thousands of words every night, and the reactions which\r\ncame back so promptly from them. The problem of publicity consumed\r\nan astonishing amount of time, anxiety and discussion among the\r\nleaders of the conference. It influenced the entire procedure, it was\r\npartly instrumental in driving the four heads of States finally into\r\nsmall secret conferences. The full achievement of publicity on one\r\noccasion--Wilson’s Italian note--nearly broke up the conference and\r\noverturned a government. The bare threat of it, upon other occasions,\r\nchanged the course of the discussion. Nothing concerned the conference\r\nmore than what democracy was going to do with diplomacy.”\r\n\r\nFor like causes we find great industries--motion pictures being one and\r\norganized baseball another--appointing as directors of their activities\r\nmen prominent in public life, doing this to assure the public of\r\nthe honest and social-minded conduct of their members. The Franklin\r\nRoosevelts are in this class, the Will Hayses and the Landises.\r\n\r\nA striking example of this interaction is illustrated in what\r\noccurred at the Hague Conference a few years ago. The effect of the\r\nHague Conference’s conduct upon the public was such that officials\r\nwere forced to open the Conference doors to the representatives of\r\nnewspapers. On June 16th, 1922, a note came from The Hague by the\r\nAssociated Press that Foreign Minister Van Karnebeek of Holland\r\ncapitulated to the world’s desire to be informed of what was going\r\non by admitting correspondents. Early announcement that “the press\r\ncannot be admitted” was, according to the report, followed by anxious\r\nemissaries begging the journalists to have patience. Editorials printed\r\nin Holland pointed out that the best way to insure public coöperation\r\nwas to take the public into its confidence. Minister van Karnebeek, who\r\nhad been at Washington, was thoroughly awake to the invaluable service\r\nthe press of the world rendered there. One editorial here pointed out\r\nthat public statements “were used by the diplomats themselves as\r\na happy means of testing popular opinion upon the various projects\r\noffered in council. How many ‘trial balloons’ were sent up in this\r\nfashion, nobody can recall. Nevertheless each delegation maintained\r\nclipping bureaus, which were brought up to date every morning and which\r\ngave the delegates accurate information as to the state of mind at\r\nhome. Thus it came about that world opinion was ready and anxious to\r\nreceive the finished work of the conference and that it was prompt to\r\nbring individual recalcitrant groups into line.”\r\n\r\nLet me quote from the _New York Evening Post_ of July, 1922, as to the\r\nimportant interaction of these forces: “The importance of the press\r\nin guiding public opinion and the coöperation between the members of\r\nthe press and the men who express public opinion in action, which has\r\ngrown up since the Peace Conference at Paris, were stressed by Lionel\r\nCurtis, who arrived on the _Adriatic_ yesterday to attend the Institute\r\nof Politics, which opens on July 27 at Williamstown. ‘Perhaps for the\r\nfirst time in history,’ he said, ‘the men whose business it is to make\r\npublic opinion were collected for some months under the same roof with\r\nthe officials whose task in life is the actual conduct of foreign\r\naffairs. In the long run, foreign policy is determined by public\r\nopinion. It was impossible in Paris not to be impressed by the immense\r\nadvantage of bringing into close contact the writers who, through the\r\npress, are making public opinion and the men who have to express their\r\nopinion in actual policy.’”\r\n\r\nHarvard University, likewise, appreciating the power of public opinion\r\nover its own activities, has recently appointed a counsel on public\r\nrelations to make its aims clear to the public.\r\n\r\nThe institutions which make public opinion conform to the demands of\r\nthe public. The public responds to an equally large degree to these\r\ninstitutions. Such fights as that made by _Collier’s Weekly_ for pure\r\nfood control show this.\r\n\r\nThe Safety First movement, by its use of every form of appeal, from\r\nposter to circular, from lecture to law enforcement, from motion\r\npictures to “safety weeks,” is bringing about a gradual change in the\r\nattitude of a safety-deserving public towards the taking of unnecessary\r\nrisks.\r\n\r\nThe Rockefeller Foundation, confronted with the serious problem\r\nof the hookworm in the South and in other localities, has brought\r\nabout a change in the habits of large sections of rural populations\r\nby analysis, investigation, applied medical principles, and public\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThe moulder of public opinion must enlist the established point of\r\nview. This is true of the press as well as of other forces. Mr. Mencken\r\nmixes cynicism and truth when he declares that the chief difficulty\r\nconfronting a newspaper which tries to carry out independent and\r\nthoughtful policies “does not lie in the direction of the board of\r\ndirectors, but in the direction of the public which buys the paper.”[13]\r\n\r\nThe _New York Tribune_, as an example of editorial bravery, points out\r\nin an advertisement published May 23, 1922, that though “news knows no\r\norder in the making” and though “a newspaper must carry the news, both\r\npleasant and unpleasant,” nevertheless, it is the duty of any newspaper\r\nto realize that there is a possibility of selective action, and that\r\n“in times of stress and bleak despair a newspaper has a hard and fast\r\nduty to perform in keeping up the morale of the community.”\r\n\r\nIndeed, the instances are frequent and accessible to the recollection\r\nof any reader in which newspapers have consciously maintained a point\r\nof view toward which the public is either hostile or cold.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, of course, even the established point of view is\r\nalterable. The two Baltimore Suns do brave their public and have been\r\nbraving their public for some time, not entirely without success.\r\nAs severe a critic as Oswald Garrison Villard points out that though\r\nmodern Baltimore is a difficult city to serve, yet the two _Suns_ have\r\ncourageously and consistently stood for the policies of their editors\r\nand have refused to yield to pressure from any source. To the public\r\nrelations counsel this is a striking illustration of the give and take\r\nbetween the public and the institutions which attempt to mould public\r\nopinion. The two interact upon each other, so that it is sometimes\r\ndifficult to tell which is one and which is the other.\r\n\r\nThe _World_ and the _Evening World_ of New York, pride themselves upon\r\nthe following campaigns which are listed in _The World Almanac_ of\r\n1922. They illustrate this interaction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Conference on Limitation of Armament Grew from ‘World’s’ Plea_\r\n\r\n“Bearing in mind in 1921 the injunction of its founder, Joseph\r\nPulitzer, to fight always for progress and reform, and having led the\r\ncampaign for disarmament in advance of any other demand therefor, the\r\n_World_ covered the Washington Conference on Limitation of Armament in\r\na comprehensive way....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Measures Advocated by ‘World’ Made Law_\r\n\r\n“During the 1921 session of the New York Legislature many measures\r\nadvocated by the _World_ were enacted. One of this paper’s chief\r\nachievements was the passage of a resolution broadening the power\r\nof the Lockwood Housing Committee, enabling it to inquire into high\r\nfinance as related to the building trades situation.\r\n\r\n“The _World_ was instrumental in obtaining the Anti-Theater Ticket\r\nSpeculator Law. It also brought about a change in bills to abolish\r\nthe Daylight-Saving Law so that municipalities might enact their\r\nown daylight-saving ordinances. It was successful in its campaign\r\nagainst the search-and-seizure and other drastic features of the State\r\nProhibition Enforcement Law.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_The ‘World’ Told Facts About Ku Klux Klan_\r\n\r\n“The _World_ on September 6 commenced the publication of a series\r\nof articles telling the truth about the Ku Klux Klan. Twenty-six\r\nnewspapers, in widely separated sections of the United States, joined\r\nthe _World_ in the publication; some had been invited to participate,\r\nothers requested the _World_ to let them use the articles. All these\r\nnewspapers realized that the only motive back of the _World’s_\r\npublication was public service. It was their desire to share in this\r\nservice, and the _World_ is proud that they asked only assurance of its\r\ntraditional accuracy and fairness before they saw their way clear to\r\ncoöperation.\r\n\r\n“The _World_ is proud that the completed record shows no evidence\r\neither that it was terrified by threats or was goaded by abuse into\r\ndepartures from its object of presenting the facts honestly and without\r\nexaggeration.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_Changes in Motor Vehicle Laws_\r\n\r\n“As a result of a crusade to lessen automobile fatalities in New\r\nYork City and State, the _World_ won a victory when changes in the\r\nmotor vehicle laws were made. The paper printed exclusive stories\r\ngiving the motor and license numbers of cars stolen daily in this\r\ncity, and started a campaign against outlaw taxicabs and financially\r\nirresponsible drivers and owners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“_‘Evening World’s’ Achievements_\r\n\r\n“The _Evening World_ continued its campaign against the coal monopoly\r\nand the high coal prices charged in New York City--a state of affairs\r\nthat has been constantly and vigorously exposed in _Evening World_\r\ncolumns. After consultation with leading Senators at Washington,\r\nseveral bills were introduced in Congress to alleviate the conditions.”\r\n\r\nI am letting the _World_ speak for itself merely as an example of\r\nwhat many splendid newspapers have accomplished as leaders in public\r\nmovements. The _New York Evening Post_ is another example, it having\r\nlong led popular demand for vocational guidance and control.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel cannot base his work merely upon the\r\nacceptance of the principle that the public and its authorities\r\ninteract. He must go deeper than that and discover why it is that a\r\npublic opinion exists independently of church, school, press, lecture\r\nplatform and motion picture screen--how far this public opinion affects\r\nthese institutions and how far these institutions affect public\r\nopinion. He must discover what the stimuli are to which public opinion\r\nresponds most readily.\r\n\r\nStudy of the mirrors of the public mind--the press, the motion\r\npictures, the lecture platform and the others--reveal to him what their\r\nstandards are and those of the groups they reach. This is not enough,\r\nhowever. To his understanding of what he actually can measure he must\r\nadd a thorough knowledge of the principles which govern individual and\r\ngroup action. A fundamental study of group and individual psychology is\r\nrequired before the public relations counsel can determine how readily\r\nindividuals or groups will accept modifications of viewpoints or\r\npolicies, which they have already imposed upon their respective mediums.\r\n\r\nNo idea or opinion is an isolated factor. It is surrounded and\r\ninfluenced by precedent, authority, habit and all the other human\r\nmotivations.\r\n\r\nFor a lucid conception of the functions, power and social utility of\r\nthe public relations counsel it is vitally important to have a clear\r\ngrasp of the fundamentals with which he must work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nAN UNDERSTANDING OF THE FUNDAMENTALS OF PUBLIC MOTIVATION IS NECESSARY\r\nTO THE WORK OF THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore defining the fundamental motivations of society, let me mention\r\nthose outward signs on which psychologists base their study of\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nPsychological habits, or as Mr. Lippmann calls them, “stereotypes,”\r\nare shorthand by which human effort is minimized. They are so clearly\r\nand commonly understood that every one will immediately respond to\r\nthe mention of a stereotype within his personal experience. The words\r\n“capitalist” or “boy scout” bring out definite images to the hearer.\r\nThese images are more comprehensible than detailed descriptions. Chorus\r\ngirl, woman lawyer, politician, detective, financier are clean-cut\r\nconcepts and capable of definition. We all have stereotypes which\r\nminimize not only our thinking habits but also the ordinary routine of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippmann finds that the stereotypes at the center of the code\r\nby which various sections of the public live “largely determine what\r\ngroup of facts we shall see and in what light we shall see them.” That\r\nis why, he says, “with the best will in the world, the news policy\r\nof a journal tends to support its editorial policy, why a capitalist\r\nsees one set of facts and certain aspects of human nature--literally\r\nsees them; his socialist opponent another set and other aspects, and\r\nwhy each regards the other as unreasonable or perverse, when the real\r\ndifference between them is a difference of perception. That difference\r\nis imposed by the difference between the capitalist and socialist\r\npattern of stereotypes. ‘There are no classes in America,’ writes an\r\nAmerican editor. ‘The history of all hitherto existing society is the\r\nhistory of class struggles,’ says the Communist Manifesto. If you have\r\nthe editor’s pattern in your mind, you will see vividly the facts\r\nthat confirm it, vaguely and ineffectively those that contradict. If\r\nyou have the communist pattern, you will not only look for different\r\nthings, but you will see with a totally different emphasis what you and\r\nthe editor happen to see in common.”\r\n\r\nThe stereotype is the basis of a large part of the work of the\r\npublic relations counsel. Let us try to inquire where the stereotype\r\noriginates--why it is so influential and why from a practical\r\nstandpoint it is so tremendously difficult to affect or change\r\nstereotypes or to attempt to substitute one set of stereotypes for\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nMr. Martin attempts to answer questions such as these in his volume on\r\n“The Behavior of Crowds.” By “crowds” Mr. Martin does not mean merely a\r\nphysical aggregation of a number of persons. To Mr. Martin the crowd is\r\nrather a state of mind, “the peculiar mental condition which sometimes\r\noccurs when people think and act together, either immediately where the\r\nmembers of the group are present and in close contact, or remotely, as\r\nwhen they affect one another in a certain way through the medium of an\r\norganization, a party or sect, the press, etc.”\r\n\r\nMotives of social behavior are based on individual instincts.\r\nIndividual instincts, on the other hand, must yield to group needs.\r\nMr. Martin pictures society as an aggregation of people who have\r\nsacrificed individual freedom in order to remain within the group. This\r\nsacrifice of freedom on the part of individuals in the groups leads its\r\nmembers to resist all efforts at fundamental changes in the group code.\r\nBecause all have made certain sacrifices, reasons are developed why\r\nsuch sacrifices must be insisted upon at all times. The “logic-proof”\r\ncompartment is the result of this unwillingness to accept changes.\r\n\r\n“What has been so painstakingly built up is not to be lightly\r\ndestroyed. Each group, therefore, within itself, considers its own\r\nstandards ultimate and indisputable, and tends to dismiss all contrary\r\nor different standards as indefensible.\r\n\r\n“Even an honest, critical understanding of the demands of the opposing\r\ncrowd is discouraged, possibly because it is rightly felt that the\r\ncritical habit of mind is as destructive of one crowd-complex as the\r\nother, and the old crowd prefers to remain intact and die in the last\r\nditch rather than risk dissolution, even with the promise of averting\r\na revolution. Hence the Romans were willing to believe that the\r\nChristians worshiped the head of an ass. The medieval Catholics, even\r\nat Leo’s court, failed to grasp the meaning of the outbreak in North\r\nGermany. Thousands saw in the reformation only the alleged fact that\r\nthe monk Luther wanted to marry a wife....”[14]\r\n\r\nThe main satisfaction, Mr. Martin thinks, which the individual derives\r\nfrom his group association is the satisfaction of his vanity through\r\nthe creation of an enlarged self-importance.\r\n\r\nThe Freudian theories upon which Mr. Martin relies very largely for\r\nhis argument lead to the conclusion that what Mr. Henry Watterson has\r\nsaid of the suppression of news applies equally to the suppression of\r\nindividual desire. Neither will suppress. With the normal person,\r\nthe result of this social suppression is to produce an individual who\r\nconforms with sufficient closeness to the standards of his group to\r\nenable him to remain comfortably within it.\r\n\r\nThe tendency, however, of the instincts and desires which are thus\r\nruled out of conduct is somehow or other, when the conditions are\r\nfavorable, to seek some avenue of release and satisfaction. To the\r\nindividual most of these avenues of release are closed. He cannot, for\r\nexample, indulge his instinct of pugnacity without running foul of\r\nthe law. The only release which the individual can have is one which\r\ncommands, however briefly, the approval of his fellows. That is why\r\nMr. Martin calls crowd psychology and crowd activity “the result of\r\nforces hidden in a personal and unconscious psyche of the members of\r\nthe crowd, forces which are merely released by social gatherings of\r\na certain sort.” The crowd enables the individual to express himself\r\naccording to his desire and without restraint.\r\n\r\nHe says further, “Every crowd ‘boosts for’ itself, gives itself airs,\r\nspeaks with oracular finality, regards itself as morally superior, and\r\nwill, so far as it has the power, lord it over every one. Notice how\r\neach group and section in society, so far as it permits itself to think\r\nas crowd, claims to be ‘the people.’”\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the boosting principle Mr. Martin points out the\r\nreadiness of most groups to enter upon conflict of one kind or another\r\nwith opposing groups. “Nothing so easily catches general attention\r\nand grips a crowd as a contest of any kind,” he says. “The crowd\r\nunconsciously identifies its members with one or the other competitor.\r\nSuccess enables the winning crowd to ‘crow over’ the losers. Such an\r\naction becomes symbolical, and is utilized by the ego to enhance its\r\nfeeling of importance. In society this egoism tends to take the form of\r\nthe desire for dominance.” According to Mr. Martin, that is why “...\r\nwhenever any attempt is being made to secure recruits for a movement\r\nor a point of view the leaders intuitively assume and reiterate the\r\ncertainty of ultimate victory.”\r\n\r\nTwo points which Mr. Martin makes seem to me most important. In the\r\nfirst place, Mr. Martin points out with absolute justice that the\r\ncrowd-mind is by no means limited to the ignorant. “Any class,” he\r\nsays, “may behave and think as a crowd--in fact, it usually does so in\r\nso far as its class interests are concerned.” Neither is the crowd-mind\r\nto be found only when there is a physical agglomeration of people. This\r\nfact is important to an understanding of the problems of the public\r\nrelations counsel, because he must bear in mind always that the readers\r\nof advertisements, the recipients of letters, the solitary listener at\r\na radio speech, the reader of the morning newspapers are mysteriously\r\npart of the crowd-mind.\r\n\r\nWhen Bergson came to America about a decade ago, men and women flocked\r\nto his classes, both the French and the English sessions. It was\r\nobvious to the observer that numbers of disciples who conscientiously\r\nattended the full course of lectures understood almost nothing of what\r\nwas being said. Their behavior was an instance of the crowd-mind.\r\n\r\nEverybody read “Main Street.” Each reader in his own study tried to\r\nreact as a crowd-mind. They felt as they thought they ought to.\r\n\r\nInitiation scandals, where the crowd-mind has created a brutality not\r\npossible to individuals, take place not only in brotherhoods among what\r\nMr. Martin calls “the lower classes,” but also among well-bred college\r\nyouths and the fraternal orders of successful business and professional\r\nmen. A more specific instance is the football game, with its\r\nmanifestations of the crowd-mind among a selected group of individuals.\r\nThe Ku Klux Klan has numbered among its violent supporters some of the\r\n“best” families of the affected localities.\r\n\r\nThe crowd is a state of mind which permeates society and its\r\nindividuals at almost all times. What becomes articulate in times of\r\nstress under great excitement is present in the mind of the individual\r\nat most times and explains in part why popular opinion is so positive\r\nand so intolerant of contrary points of view. The college professor in\r\nhis study on a peaceful summer day is just as likely to be reacting as\r\na unit of a crowd-mind, as any member of a lynching party in Texas or\r\nGeorgia.\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter in his book, “Instincts of the Herd in Peace and War,”[15]\r\ngives us further material for study. He discusses the underlying causes\r\nand results of “herd” tendencies, stressing the herd’s cohesiveness.\r\n\r\nThe tendency the group has to standardize the habits of individuals\r\nand to assign logical reasons for them is an important factor in the\r\nwork of the public relations counsel. The predominant point of view,\r\naccording to Mr. Trotter, which translates a rationalized point of view\r\ninto an axiomatic truth, arises and derives its strength from the fact\r\nthat it enlists herd support for the point of view of the individual.\r\nThis explains why it is so easy to popularize many ideas.\r\n\r\n“The cardinal quality of the herd is homogeneity.”[16] The biological\r\nsignificance of homogeneity lies in its survival value. The wolf\r\npack is many times as strong as the combined strength of each of its\r\nindividual members. These results of homogeneity have created the\r\n“herd” point of view.\r\n\r\nOne of the psychological results of homogeneity is the fact that\r\nphysical loneliness is a real terror to the gregarious animal, and that\r\nassociation with the herd causes a feeling of security. In man this\r\nfear of loneliness creates a desire for identification with the herd in\r\nmatters of opinion. It is here, says Mr. Trotter,[17] that we find “the\r\nineradicable impulse mankind has always displayed towards segregation\r\ninto classes. Each one of us in his opinions and his conduct, in\r\nmatters of amusement, religion, and politics, is compelled to obtain\r\nthe support of a class, of a herd within the herd.”\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Trotter:[18] “The effect of it will clearly be to make\r\nacceptable those suggestions which come from the herd, and those only.\r\nIt is of especial importance to note that this suggestibility is not\r\ngeneral, and it is only herd suggestions which are rendered acceptable\r\nby the action of instinct, and man is, for example, notoriously\r\ninsensitive to the suggestions of experience. The history of what is\r\nrather grandiosely called human progress everywhere illustrates this.\r\nIf we look back upon the developments of some such thing as the steam\r\nengine, we cannot fail to be struck by the extreme obviousness of each\r\nadvance, and how obstinately it was refused assimilation until the\r\nmachine almost invented itself.”\r\n\r\nThe workings of the gregarious instinct in man result frequently in\r\nconduct of the most remarkable complexity, but it is characterized by\r\nall of the qualities of instinctive action. Such conduct is usually\r\nrationalized, but this does not conceal its real character.\r\n\r\nWe may sincerely think that we vote the Republican ticket because we\r\nhave thought out the issues of the political campaign and reached our\r\ndecision in the cold-blooded exercise of judgment. The fact remains\r\nthat it is just as likely that we voted the Republican ticket because\r\nwe did so the year before or because the Republican platform contains a\r\ndeclaration of principle, no matter how vague, which awakens profound\r\nemotional response in us, or because our neighbor whom we do not like\r\nhappens to be a Democrat.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippmann remarks:[19] “For the most part we do not first see and\r\nthen define, we define first and then see. In the great booming,\r\nbuzzing confusion of the outer world we pick out of the clutter what\r\nis already defined for us, and we tend to perceive that which we have\r\npicked out in the form stereotyped for us by our culture.”\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter cites as a few of the examples of rationalization the\r\nmechanism which “enables the European lady who wears rings in her ears\r\nto smile at the barbarism of the colored lady who wears her rings\r\nin her nose”[20] and the process which enables the Englishman “who\r\nis amused by the African chieftain’s regard for the top hat as an\r\nessential piece of the furniture of state to ignore the identity of his\r\nown behavior when he goes to church beneath the same tremendous ensign.”\r\n\r\nThe gregarious tendency in man, according to Mr. Trotter, results in\r\nfive characteristics which he displays in common with all gregarious\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n1. “_He is intolerant and fearful of solitude, physical or\r\nmental._”[21] The same urge which drives the buffalo into the herd\r\nand man into the city requires on the part of the latter a sense of\r\nspiritual identification with the herd. Man is never so much at home as\r\nwhen on the band wagon.\r\n\r\n2. “_He is more sensitive to the voice of the herd than to any other\r\ninfluence._” Mr. Trotter illustrates this characteristic in a paragraph\r\nwhich is worth quoting in its entirety. He says: “It (the voice of\r\nthe herd) can inhibit or stimulate his thought and conduct. It is\r\nthe source of his moral codes, of the sanctions of his ethics and\r\nphilosophy. It can endow him with energy, courage, and endurance, and\r\ncan as easily take these away. It can make him acquiesce in his own\r\npunishment and embrace his executioner, submit to poverty, bow to\r\ntyranny, and sink without complaint under starvation. Not merely can\r\nit make him accept hardship and suffering unresistingly, but it can\r\nmake him accept as truth the explanation that his perfectly preventable\r\nafflictions are sublimely just and gentle. It is this acme of the power\r\nof herd suggestion that is perhaps the most absolutely incontestable\r\nproof of the profoundly gregarious nature of man.”\r\n\r\n3. “_He is subject to the passions of the pack in his mob violence and\r\nthe passions of the herd in his panics._”\r\n\r\n4. “_He is remarkably susceptible to leadership._” Mr. Trotter points\r\nout that the need for leadership is often satisfied by leadership of a\r\nquality which cannot stand analysis, and which must therefore satisfy\r\nsome impulse rather than the demands of reason.\r\n\r\n5. “_His relations with his fellows are dependent upon the recognition\r\nof him as a member of the herd._”\r\n\r\nThe gregarious tendency, Mr. Trotter believes, is biologically\r\nfundamental. He finds therefore that the herd reaction is not confined\r\nto outbreaks such as panics and mob violence, but that it is a constant\r\nfactor in all human thinking and feeling. Discussing the results of\r\nthe sensitiveness of the individual to the herd point of view, Mr.\r\nTrotter says in part, “To believe must be an ineradicable natural bias\r\nof man, or in other words, an affirmation, positive or negative, is\r\nmore readily accepted than rejected, unless its source is definitely\r\ndisassociated from the herd. _Man is not, therefore, suggestible by\r\nfits and starts, not merely in panics and mobs, under hypnosis, and so\r\nforth, but always, everywhere, and under any circumstances._”\r\n\r\nThe suggestibility of people to ideas which are part of the standards\r\nof their groups could not be more succinctly expressed than in the old\r\ncommand, “When in Rome do as the Romans.”\r\n\r\nPsychologists have defined for the public relations counsel the\r\nfundamental equipment of the individual mind and its relation to group\r\nreactions. We have seen the motivations of the individual mind--the\r\nmotivations of the group mind. We have seen the characteristics in\r\nthought and action of the individual and the group. All these things\r\nwe have touched on, though briefly, since they form the ground-work of\r\nknowledge for the public relations counsel. Their application will be\r\ndiscussed later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE GROUP AND HERD ARE THE BASIC MECHANISMS OF PUBLIC CHANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe institutions that make public opinion carry on against a background\r\nwhich is in itself a controlling factor. The real character of this\r\ncontrolling background we shall take up later. Let us first consider\r\nsome examples that prove its existence--then we can look into its\r\norigin and its standards.\r\n\r\nPowerful standards control the very institutions which are supposed to\r\nhelp form public opinion. It is necessary to understand the origin, the\r\nworking and the strength of these institutions in order to understand\r\nthe institutions themselves and their effect upon the public.\r\n\r\nIn tracing the interaction of institution upon public and public upon\r\ninstitution, one finds a circle of obedience and leadership. The press,\r\nthe school and other leaders of thought are themselves working in a\r\nbackground which they cannot entirely control.\r\n\r\nLet us turn to the press again for a text.\r\n\r\nThat the press is so frequently unable to achieve a result on which\r\nits combined members are unanimously set makes it evident that the\r\npress itself is working in a medium which it cannot entirely control.\r\nThe _New York Times_ motto, “All the news that’s fit to print,” drives\r\nthis point home. The standards of fitness created in the minds of\r\nthe publishers express the point of view of a mass of readers, and\r\nthis enables the newspapers to achieve and maintain circulation and\r\nfinancial success.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that newspapers must sell to the public is an evidence\r\nthat they must please the public and in a measure obey it. In the press\r\nthere is a very human tendency to compromise between giving the public\r\nwhat it wants and giving the public what it _should_ want. This is\r\nequally true in music, where artists like McCormack or Rachmaninoff\r\npopularize their programs. It is true in the drama, where managers,\r\nproducers and authors combine to adjust plots, situations and endings\r\nto what the public will be willing to pay to see. It is true in art, in\r\narchitecture, in motion pictures. It is true of the lecture platform\r\nand of the pulpit.\r\n\r\nSo-called radical preachers, for example, usually succeed in\r\nbroadcasting their radical ideas only when their following is prepared\r\nto accept their views. The Rev. Percy Stickney Grant was a great\r\nproblem to the upholders of the accepted order, only because there was\r\nso large a body of parishioners eager to hear and accept his _dicta_.\r\nThe Rev. Billy Sunday, evangelist, derived his following from among\r\npeople who were awaiting a faith-stirring appeal.\r\n\r\nAnother evidence of the fact that a powerful outside influence helps\r\nmake the forces that mould public opinion is shown by the newspapers in\r\nthe actual selection of news. The public actually demands that certain\r\ntypes of facts be omitted. The standing problem of every newspaper\r\noffice--the winnowing of the day’s news from the mass of material that\r\nreaches the editorial desks--illustrates pointedly the need there is to\r\nexamine the reasons which prompt the editors in selection.\r\n\r\nIn an exceedingly interesting advertisement published by the _New York\r\nTribune_, on April 19, 1922, the _Tribune’s_ editors state the problem\r\nmost graphically. The advertisement is headed, “What Else Happened That\r\nDay?” and it reads as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Madame Caillaux was on trial in Paris for killing Gaston\r\n    Calmette.\r\n\r\n    “In Long Island a woman was mysteriously shot in a doctor’s\r\n    office while on a night visit.\r\n\r\n    “Forty-five stage coaches were held up in Yellowstone Park by\r\n    two masked bandits who took all the cash of 165 tourists.\r\n\r\n    “Romantic crime, mystery crime, adventurous crime, a public\r\n    eagerly interested--and they suddenly dropped from the\r\n    newspapers. The public forgot them. As news, these events\r\n    became as if they had never happened. Something else had\r\n    happened.\r\n\r\n    “The day of Madame Caillaux’s acquittal Austria declared war\r\n    on Serbia. Russia mobilized fourteen army corps on the German\r\n    border and the price of wheat in this country soared.\r\n\r\n    “All the news that a newspaper prints is affected by what else\r\n    happened that day. If an earthquake occurs the day you announce\r\n    your daughter’s engagement her picture may be left out of the\r\n    newspaper.\r\n\r\n    “The man who made a golf hole in one the day of the\r\n    Dempsey-Carpentiér fight was out of luck so far as an item on\r\n    the sporting page was concerned.\r\n\r\n    “When real news breaks, semi-news must go. When real news is\r\n    scarce, semi-news returns to the front page. A very great man\r\n    picked out Sunday night to dine at a Bowery mission. Monday is\r\n    usually a dull day for news, although some big events, notably\r\n    the sinking of the _Titanic_, came over the wires Sunday night.\r\n\r\n    “All papers feature big news. When there is no big news, real\r\n    editing is needed to select the real news from the semi-news.\r\n\r\n    “What you read on dull news days is what fixes your opinions\r\n    of your country and of your compatriots. It is from the\r\n    non-sensational news that you see the world and assess, rightly\r\n    or wrongly, the true value of persons and events.\r\n\r\n    “The relative importance your newspaper gives to an occurrence\r\n    affects your thought, your character, and your children’s\r\n    thought and character. For few daily habits are as firmly\r\n    established as the habit of reading the newspaper.”\r\n\r\nNow each of the items mentioned in the _Tribune’s_ advertisement was\r\nnews. Comparison of the newspapers of that day will undoubtedly show a\r\nwide divergence in the manner in which these items were treated and in\r\nthe relative importance assigned to each. The basis of the selection\r\nwas clearly the general standard of the clientele of each individual\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nAnd this selection of ideas for presentation goes on in every medium of\r\nthought communication.\r\n\r\nThis basis of selection has long been recognized. Thus in an article in\r\nthe _Atlantic Monthly_ for February, 1911, Professor Hargar, formerly\r\nhead of the Department of Journalism at the University of Kansas,\r\ndraws attention to it in regard to newspapers, and points out that\r\n“the province of the city paper is one of news selection.[22] Out of\r\nthe vast skein of the day’s happenings what shall it select? More\r\n‘copy’ is thrown away than is used. The _New York Sun_ is written as\r\ndefinitely for a given constituency as is a technical journal. Out of\r\nthe day’s news it gives prominence to that which fits into its scheme\r\nof treatment, and there is so much news that it can fill its columns\r\nwith interesting materials, yet leave untouched a myriad of events. The\r\n_New York Evening Post_ appeals to another constituency, and is made\r\naccordingly. The _World_ and the _Journal_ have a far different plan,\r\nand ‘play up’ stories that are mentioned briefly, or ignored, by some\r\nof their contemporaries. So the writer on the metropolitan paper is\r\ntrained to sift news, to choose from his wealth of material that which\r\nthe paper’s traditions demand shall receive attention; and so abundant\r\nis the supply that he can easily set a feast without exhausting the\r\nmarket’s offering. Unconsciously he becomes an epicure, and knows no\r\nday will dawn without bringing him his opportunity.”\r\n\r\nMr. Lippmann makes the same observation. He says:[23] “Every newspaper\r\nwhen it reaches the reader is the result of a whole series of\r\nselections as to what items shall be printed, in what position they\r\nshall be printed, how much space each shall occupy, what emphasis\r\neach shall have. There are no objective standards here. There are\r\nconventions. Take two newspapers published in the same city on the same\r\nmorning. The headline of one reads: ‘Britain pledges aid to Berlin\r\nagainst French Aggression. France Openly Backs Poles.’ The headline\r\nof the second is: ‘Mrs. Stillman’s Other Love.’ Which you prefer is a\r\nmatter of taste, but _not entirely a matter of the editor’s taste_. It\r\nis a matter of his _judgment as to what will absorb the half hour’s\r\nattention a certain set of readers will give to his newspaper_.”\r\n\r\nThe American stage continually bows to public demand and consciously\r\nascribes to the public the changes it undergoes. The character\r\nof advertising has definitely yielded to public demand and fake\r\nadvertising has been to a great extent eliminated. Motion pictures have\r\nresponded, too, to public taste and public pressure, both as to the\r\nkind of picture presented and, in isolated instances, to the type of\r\naction permitted to appear.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore apparent that these and the other institutions which\r\nmodify public opinion carry on against a background which is also\r\nin itself a controlling factor. What the real character of this\r\ncontrolling background is we shall now consider.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE APPLICATION OF THESE PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Trotter, Martin and the other writers we have quoted confirm what\r\nthe actual experience of the public relations counsel shows--that the\r\ncause he represents must have some group reaction and tradition in\r\ncommon with the public he is trying to reach. This must exist before\r\nthey can react sympathetically upon one another. Given these common\r\nfundamentals, much can be done to capitalize or destroy them. It is\r\nas untrue to contend that public opinion is manufactured as it is to\r\ncontend that public opinion governs the agencies which mould it.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel must continually realize that there are\r\nalways these limitations to his effectiveness.\r\n\r\nThe very “leaders,” men who have been selected from the mass to “lead\r\nthe nation,” live with their ears to the ground for every slight\r\nrumbling of public sentiment. Preachers, acknowledged to be the ethical\r\nleaders of their flocks, express obedience to public opinion.\r\n\r\nThe critics who hold these extreme points of view about public opinion\r\nhave too easily confused cause and effect. The sympathy between the\r\norator and his audience is not one which the orator can create. He\r\ncan intensify it, or by tactless speaking he can dissipate it, but he\r\ncannot manufacture it from thin air.\r\n\r\nMargaret Sanger, a leader in the fight for education on birth control,\r\nwill evoke enthusiasm when she addresses an audience that approves\r\nof her sentiments. When, however, she injects her point of view into\r\ngroups that have a preconceived aversion to them, she is in danger\r\nof abuse, if not of actual physical violence. Likewise, a man who\r\nwould talk of prison reform at a time when the public is aroused by\r\nan unwonted crime wave will find little response. On the other hand,\r\nwhen Madam Curie, co-discoverer of radium, came to America, she found\r\na country that was prepared to meet her because of intensive effort on\r\nthe part of a large radium corporation and a committee of women formed\r\nby Marie B. Meloney, to apprise the public of the importance of her\r\nvisit. Had she come two years sooner, she might have been ignored save\r\nby a few scientists.\r\n\r\nA historic incident illustrative of the interaction between a leader\r\nand a public is that of the sudden turn in the affairs of Rear\r\nAdmiral Dewey. The idol of the Spanish American War, he nevertheless\r\nalienated popular affection by giving to his wife a house which had\r\nbeen presented to him by an admiring public. For some reason the public\r\nfailed to sympathize with Admiral Dewey’s own undoubtedly sound and\r\nworthy reasons.\r\n\r\nTo say, therefore, as some persons have said at great length and\r\nwith considerable vehemence, that the public relations counsel is\r\nresponsible for public opinion, is not true. The public relations\r\ncounsel is not needed to persuade people to standardize their points of\r\nview or to persist in their established beliefs. The established point\r\nof view becomes established by satisfying some real or assumed human\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nIn common with the scenario writer, the preacher, the statesman, the\r\ndramatist, the public relations counsel, has his share in making up the\r\nmind of the public. The public quite as truly makes up the mind of the\r\njournalist, the pamphleteer, the scenario writer, the preacher and the\r\nstatesman. The main direction of the public mind is often irrevocably\r\nset for its leaders.\r\n\r\nHendrik Van Loon, in his “Story of Mankind,” paints a picture of the\r\naction and interaction between Napoleon the Great and his public in\r\na way that might well have been made to illustrate our point. When\r\nNapoleon led the public truly in the direction towards which it was\r\nheaded, that is, towards democracy and equality, he was its successful\r\nleader and its idol, says Van Loon. When in the latter part of his\r\ncareer he turned back to a goal which the public had discarded and was\r\neager to forget, that is, Bourbonism, Napoleon met with irresistible\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\n“Damaged Goods” was able to make the American public accept the word\r\n“syphilis” because the counsel on public relations projected the\r\ndoctrine of sex hygiene through those groups and sections of the public\r\nwhich were prepared to work with him.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion is the resultant of the interaction between two forces.\r\n\r\nThis may help us to see with greater clarity the position the public\r\nrelations counsel holds in relation to the world at large, and what the\r\nfactors are with which he is concerned and by which he accomplishes his\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nWe have gone somewhat elaborately into the fundamental equipment of\r\nthe individual mind and its relation to the group mind because the\r\npublic relations counsel in his work in these fields must constantly\r\ncall upon his knowledge of individual and group psychology. The public\r\nrelations counsel can come forward, first, as the representative of\r\nestablished things when their security is shaken, or when they desire\r\ngreater power; and second, as the representative of the group which is\r\nstruggling to establish itself.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippmann says propaganda is dependent upon censorship. From my\r\npoint of view the precise reverse is more nearly true. Propaganda is a\r\npurposeful, directed effort to overcome censorship--the censorship of\r\nthe group mind and the herd reaction.\r\n\r\nThe average citizen is the world’s most efficient censor. His own mind\r\nis the greatest barrier between him and the facts. His own “logic-proof\r\ncompartments,” his own absolutism are the obstacles which prevent him\r\nfrom seeing in terms of experience and thought rather than in terms of\r\ngroup reaction.\r\n\r\nThe training of the public relations counsel permits him to step out\r\nof his own group to look at a particular problem with the eyes of an\r\nimpartial observer and to utilize his knowledge of the individual and\r\nthe group mind to project his clients’ point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III\r\n\r\nTECHNIQUE AND METHOD\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLIC CAN BE REACHED ONLY THROUGH ESTABLISHED MEDIUMS OF\r\nCOMMUNICATION\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the United States was made up of small social units with common\r\ntraditions and a small geographic and social area, it was comparatively\r\nsimple for the proponent of a point of view to address his public\r\ndirectly. If he represented a social or a political idea, he could, at\r\nno very great expense and with no very great difficulty in the early\r\nEighteenth Century, cover New England with his pamphlets. He could\r\narouse the thirteen colonies with his journals and brochures. That was\r\nbecause the heritage of these groups made them sensitive to the same\r\nstimuli. One man, remarks Mr. Lippmann, then was able single-handed to\r\ncrystallize the common will of his country in his day and generation.\r\nTo-day the greatest superman as yet developed by humanity could not\r\naccomplish the same result with the United States.\r\n\r\nPopulations have increased. In this country geographical areas have\r\nincreased. Heterogeneity has also increased. A group living in any\r\ngiven area is now extremely likely to have no common ancestry, no\r\ncommon tradition, as such, and no cohesive intelligence. All these\r\nelements make it necessary to-day for the proponent of a point of view\r\nto engage an expert to represent him before society, an expert who\r\nmust know how to reach groups totally dissimilar as to ideals, customs\r\nand even language. It is this necessity which has resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of the counsel on public relations.\r\n\r\nNow it must be understood that the proponent of a point of view,\r\nwhether acting alone or under the guidance of a public relations\r\ncounsel, must utilize existing avenues of approach. Modern conditions\r\nare such that it is not feasible to build up independent organs.\r\nInnovators and innovations cannot create their own channels of\r\ncommunication. They must for a great part work through the existing\r\ndaily press, the existing magazine, the existing lecture circuit,\r\nexisting advertising mediums, the existing motion picture channels\r\nand other means for the communication of ideas. The public relations\r\ncounsel, on behalf of the groups he represents, must reach majorities\r\nand minorities through their respective approaches.\r\n\r\nIf the public relations counsel can succeed in presenting ideas and\r\nfacts to the public in spite of the heterogeneity of society, in\r\nspite of the vast psychological and geographic problems, in spite of\r\nthe difficulties, monetary and otherwise, of reaching and influencing\r\npopulations numbering millions--if he can succeed in overcoming\r\nthese difficulties by a skillful understanding of the situation, his\r\nprofession is socially valuable.\r\n\r\nAbsolute homogeneity, resulting in a dead level of uniformity in public\r\nand individual reaction, is undesirable. On the other hand, agreement\r\non broad social purposes is essential to progress. Agreement on broad\r\nindustrial purposes may be equally desirable. Without such agreement,\r\nwithout unified purposes, there can be no progress and the unit must\r\nfall. The men who were most effective in stimulating national morale\r\nduring the war never lost sight of these underlying needs, whether they\r\nstimulated a whole nation to ration itself voluntarily and give up the\r\neating of sugar, or whether they stimulated knitting and Red Cross\r\nactivities and voluntary contributions to funds.\r\n\r\nThree ways are cited by Mr. Lippmann to obtain cohesive force among\r\nthe special and local interests which make up national and social\r\nunits. The public relations counsel avails himself only of the third.\r\nThe first method which is described is that of “patronage and pork.”\r\nThis is very largely the method relied upon by certain legislative\r\nbodies to-day to maintain cohesive force. As an instance of this, the\r\ninvestigations of the methods used in connection with the bills to\r\nsecure the building of local post offices or the dredging of harbors or\r\nrivers seem to point out that a representative from one community will\r\npromise reciprocal support to the member from another community, if he\r\nin turn will act favorably on another item. This method intensifies\r\nthe feeling that all are working together, even though they may not be\r\nworking for the highest interests of the country. Similarly the chief\r\nexecutive of a city may institute certain measures to placate school\r\nteachers. He will expect the school teachers to support him on some\r\nother project at some other period.\r\n\r\nThe second method named by Mr. Lippmann[24] is “government by terror\r\nand obedience.”\r\n\r\nThe third method is “government based on such a highly developed system\r\nof information, analysis and self-consciousness that ‘the knowledge\r\nof national circumstances and reasons of state’ is evident to all\r\nmen. The autocratic system is in decay. The voluntary system is in\r\nits very earliest development and so, in calculating the prospects\r\nof associations among large groups of people, a league of nations,\r\nindustrial government, or a federal union of states, the degree to\r\nwhich the material for a common consciousness exists determines how\r\nfar coöperation will depend upon force, or upon the milder alternative\r\nto force, which is patronage and privilege. The secret of great state\r\nbuilders, like Alexander Hamilton, is that they know how to calculate\r\nthese principles.”\r\n\r\nThe method of education by information, which was to a great extent\r\nrelied upon by the United States, for example, was evidenced in the\r\nformation during the war of such agencies as the Committee on Public\r\nInformation. The public relations counsel, through the mediums chosen\r\nby him, presented to the public the information necessary to aid in\r\nunderstanding America’s war aims and ideals. George Creel and his\r\norganization reached vast groups, representing every phase of our\r\nnational elements, in every modern method of thought communication. But\r\neven in the United States the other two methods were used to obtain\r\ncohesive force.\r\n\r\nIn fact the method least relied upon in any of the belligerent\r\ncountries was that of “government based on such a highly developed\r\nsystem of information, analysis and self-consciousness that ‘the\r\nknowledge of national circumstances and reasons of state’ is evident to\r\nall men.”\r\n\r\nThis breakdown did not occur among small, inefficiently organised\r\ngroups. It occurred among the representatives of the highest\r\ndevelopment in social organization.\r\n\r\nIf this was the fate of the most highly organized social groups,\r\nconsider then the problem which confronts the social, economic,\r\neducational or political groups in peace time, when they attempt to\r\nobtain a public hearing for new ideas. Innumerable instances have shown\r\nthe difficulty that any group faces in gaining an acceptance for its\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nThe development of the United States to its present size and\r\ndiversification has intensified the difficulty of creating a common\r\nwill on any subject because it has heightened the natural tendency of\r\nmen to separate into crowds opposed to one another in point of view.\r\nThis difficulty is further emphasized by the fact that often these\r\ncrowds live in different traditional, moral and spiritual worlds. The\r\nphysical difficulties of communication make group separation greater.\r\n\r\nMr. Trotter’s conclusions from a study of the gregarious instinct are\r\nsingularly apt on this point. He says that[25] “the enormous power\r\nof varied reaction possessed by man must render necessary for his\r\nattainment of the full advantages of the gregarious habit a power\r\nof inter-communication of absolutely unprecedented fineness. It is\r\nclear that scarcely a hint of such power has yet appeared, and it is\r\nequally obvious that it is this defect which gives to society the\r\ncharacteristics which are the contempt of the man of science and the\r\ndisgust of the humanitarian.”\r\n\r\nWhen the worker was of the same ancestry as his employer, labor\r\ndifficulties, for example, could be discussed in terms which were\r\ncomprehensible to both parties. To-day the United States Steel\r\nCorporation must exert tremendous effort to present its view to its\r\nthousands of employees who are South Europeans, North Europeans,\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nCzechoslovakia, during the Peace Conference, wanted to appeal to\r\nits countrymen in America, but this group was vague and scattered\r\nin a population that lived in many cities throughout the country.\r\nThe public relations counsel who was engaged to reach this scattered\r\npopulation had, therefore, to translate his appeals so that they\r\nmight be understood logically and emotionally by the educated and the\r\nuneducated, the urban, the rural, the laboring and the professional man.\r\n\r\nThe same problem in a quite different guise presented itself to the\r\npublic relations counsel who wanted to insure a public response to\r\nthe appeal of the Diaghileff Russian Ballet, of which the public knew\r\nnothing. He had, therefore, to surmount the difficulties of dissimilar\r\ngeographic and artistic heritage and taste, of unwillingness to accept\r\nnovelty and of interests already firmly attached to other forms of\r\namusement.\r\n\r\nDominant groups to-day are more secure in their position than was the\r\nmost successful autocrat of several hundred years ago, because to-day\r\nthe inertia which must be overcome in order to displace these groups\r\nis so much greater. So many persons with so many different points of\r\nview must be reached and unified before anything effective can be\r\ndone. Unity can be secured only by finding the greatest common factor\r\nor divisor of all the groups; and it is difficult to find one common\r\nfactor which will appeal to a large and unhomogeneous group.\r\n\r\nA very simple and broadly appealing campaign for reaching the public\r\nwas undertaken recently by the railroads in combination. They utilized\r\nthe poster in graphic, fundamental appeal to awaken an instinct of\r\ncarefulness in regard to crossing railroad tracks. When the government\r\nsought to reëstablish ex-service men, the public relations counsel\r\nhad to appeal vividly and quickly to employers and returned soldiers\r\nout of the vast complexity of their interests. He selected the most\r\nfundamental appeals of loyalty, fairness and patriotism in order to be\r\nunderstood actively.\r\n\r\nDomination to-day is not a product of armies or navies or wealth or\r\npolicies. It is a domination based on the one hand upon accomplished\r\nunity, and on the other hand upon the fact that opposition is generally\r\ncharacterized by a high degree of disunity. The institution of electing\r\nrepresentatives to Congress is so firmly established that no existent\r\nforce to-day can overthrow it. More specifically, why is it that the\r\ntwo parties, Republican and Democrat, have maintained themselves as\r\nthe dominant force for so many years? Only the leadership of Theodore\r\nRoosevelt seemed for a time to supersede them; and events since then\r\nhave shown that it was Roosevelt and not his party who succeeded. The\r\nFarmer-Labor Party, the Socialist Party despite years of campaigning\r\nhave failed to become even strongly recognizable opponents to the\r\nestablished groups. The disunity of forces which seek to overthrow\r\ndominant groups is illustrated every day in every phase of our\r\nlives--political, moral and economic. A new point of view, although\r\nfaced by the difficulty of unifying a group to concerted will or\r\naction, can seldom establish new mediums by which to approach those\r\npeople to whom it wishes to appeal.\r\n\r\nIt is possible for advertising and pamphletizing to blanket the country\r\nat a cost. To establish a new lecture service in order to reach the\r\npublic would be expensive, and effective only to a limited extent.\r\nTo establish an independent radio station to broadcast an idea would\r\nbe difficult and probably disproportionately expensive. To create a\r\nnew motion picture and a distributing agency would be slow, and very\r\ndifficult and costly, if possible at all.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of establishing and building new channels of approach\r\nto the public is shown best by an examination of the principal mediums\r\nwhich are available to the public relations counsel who desires to\r\ndirect public thought to the problems of the group he represents.\r\n\r\nIt is only necessary to picture the newspaper and magazine situation\r\nin the United States to-day to realize the difficulty of establishing\r\na new medium for the representation of a point of view. Americans are\r\naccustomed to first-rate service from their press. They demand a high\r\nstandard not only in the physical appearance of their newspapers but\r\nin the news service as well. Their daily paper must provide them with\r\nitems of local, state and international interest and importance. In the\r\ncomplex activities of modern life, the newspaper must find and select\r\nthe subjects which interest its readers. It must also give to its\r\nreaders the news fresh from the making. Whatever vagueness there may be\r\nabout the definition of news itself, one admitted constant is that it\r\nmust be fresh.\r\n\r\nThe cost of establishing a paper with a wide appeal, which will have\r\nthe facilities of gathering news, of printing and distributing it,\r\nis such that groups can no longer depend upon their own organs of\r\nexpression. The Christian Science church does not depend upon its\r\nadmirable publication, the _Christian Science Monitor_ in order to\r\nreach its own and new publics. Even where the issue demands a partisan\r\nor class origin of a newspaper, as in the case of a political party,\r\nthe results achieved by so expensive and laborious a step seldom\r\njustify it.\r\n\r\nMr. Given in his book “Making a Newspaper,” points out the great\r\nexpense that is attached to the publication of a large metropolitan\r\ndaily. In proportion to their field of appeal and potential income, the\r\nsmaller dailies undoubtedly face the same economic problems. Mr. Given\r\nsays:[26] “Few persons not having intimate knowledge of a newspaper\r\nhave any idea of the great amount of money required to start one, or to\r\nkeep one running which is already established. The mechanical equipment\r\nand delivery service alone may demand an investment of several hundred\r\nthousand dollars--there is one New York paper whose mechanical\r\nequipment cost $1,000,000--supplies are in constant demand, and the\r\nsalary list is a long and heavy one. For a new paper the salary list\r\nof the editorial department is especially formidable, as editors and\r\nreporters who have employment with well-established publications are\r\nalways reluctant to change to a venture that at best is in for a rough\r\nvoyage, and can be attracted only by high pay.\r\n\r\n“A good many of the newspapers that are started soon become memories,\r\nand fewer than are generally supposed are paying their own way. The\r\nsum of $3,000,000 would hardly suffice at the present time to equip a\r\nfirst-class newspaper establishment in New York City, issue a morning\r\nand an evening edition paper, build up a circulation of 75,000 for\r\neach, and place the establishment on a money-making basis. Run on the\r\nlines of those already established and possessing no extraordinary\r\nfeatures to recommend them to the public, the two papers might\r\ncontinue to lose money for twenty years. When one learns that there\r\nare in New York business managers who are compelled to reckon with an\r\naverage weekly expense account of nearly $50,000, he can understand\r\nthe possibility of heavy losses. And it might be added, in contrast,\r\nthat there are in New York newspapers which could not be bought for\r\n$10,000,000.”\r\n\r\nDiscussing substantially the same point, Mr. Oswald Garrison Villard\r\nobserves the narrowing down of the number of newspapers in our large\r\ncities and points out the imminent danger of a news monopoly in\r\nthe United States. He says:[27] “It is the danger that newspaper\r\nconditions, because of the enormously increased costs and this tendency\r\nto monopoly, may prevent people who are actuated by passion and\r\nsentiment from founding newspapers, which is causing many students of\r\nthe situation much concern. What is to be the hope for the advocates\r\nof new-born and unpopular reforms if they cannot have a press of their\r\nown, as the Abolitionists and the founders of the Republican party set\r\nup theirs in a remarkably short time, usually with poverty-stricken\r\nbank accounts?”\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel must always sub-divide the appeal of his\r\nsubject and present it through the widest possible variety of avenues\r\nto the public. That these avenues must be existing avenues is both a\r\nlimitation and an opportunity.\r\n\r\nPeople accept the facts which come to them through existing channels.\r\nThey like to hear new things in accustomed ways. They have neither the\r\ntime nor the inclination to search for facts that are not readily\r\navailable to them. The expert, therefore, must advise first upon the\r\nform of action desirable for his client and secondly must utilize the\r\nestablished mediums of communication, in order to present to the public\r\na point of view. This is true whether it is that of a majority or\r\nminority, old or new personality, institution or group which desires to\r\nchange by modification or intensification the store of knowledge and\r\nthe opinion of the public.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE INTERLAPPING GROUP FORMATIONS OF SOCIETY, THE CONTINUOUS SHIFTING\r\nOF GROUPS, CHANGING CONDITIONS AND THE FLEXIBILITY OF HUMAN NATURE ARE\r\nALL AIDS TO THE COUNSEL ON PUBLIC RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel works with public opinion. Public opinion\r\nis the product of individual minds. Individual minds make up the\r\ngroup mind. And the established order of things is maintained by the\r\ninertia of the group. Three factors make it possible for the public\r\nrelations counsel to overcome even this inertia. These are, first,\r\nthe interlapping group formation of society; second, the continuous\r\nshifting of groups; third, the changed physical conditions to which\r\ngroups respond. All of these are brought about by the natural inherent\r\nflexibility of individual human nature.\r\n\r\nSociety is not divided into two groups, although it seems so to many.\r\nSome see modern society divided into capital and labor. The feminist\r\nsees the world divided into men and women. The hungry man sees the\r\nrich and the poor. The missionary sees the heathen and the faithful. If\r\nsociety were divided into two groups, and no more, then change could\r\ncome about only through violent upheaval.\r\n\r\nLet us assume, for example, a society divided into capital and labor.\r\nIt is apparent on slight inspection that capital is not a homogeneous\r\ngroup. There is a difference in point of view and in interests between\r\nElbert H. Gary or John D. Rockefeller, Jr., on the one hand, and the\r\nsmall shopkeeper on the other.\r\n\r\nOccasions arise, too, upon which even in one group sharp differences\r\nand competitive alignments take place.\r\n\r\nIn the capital group, on the tariff question, for example, the retailer\r\nwith a net income of ten thousand dollars a year is apt to take a\r\nradically different position from the manufacturer with a similar\r\nincome. In some respects the capitalist is a consumer. In other\r\nrespects he is a worker. Many persons are at the same time workers and\r\ncapitalists. The highly paid worker who also draws income from Liberty\r\nBonds or from shares of stock in industrial corporations is an example\r\nof this.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the so-called workers do not consist of a\r\nhomogeneous group with complete identity of interests. There may be\r\nno difference in economic situation between manual labor and mental\r\nlabor; yet there is a traditional difference in point of view which\r\nkeeps these two groups far apart. Again, the narrower field of manual\r\nlabor, the group represented by the American Federation of Labor,\r\nis frequently opposed in sympathies and interests to the group of\r\nIndustrial Workers of the World. Even in the American Federation of\r\nLabor there are component units. The locomotive engineer, who belongs\r\nto one of the great brotherhoods, has different interests from the\r\nminer, who belongs to the United Mine Workers of America.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is in a class by himself. Yet he in turn may be a tenant\r\nfarmer or the owner of an estate or of a small patch of tillable soil.\r\n\r\nThat group so vaguely called “the public” consists of all sorts and\r\nconditions of men, the particular kind or condition depending upon\r\nthe point of view of the individual who is making the observation or\r\nclassification. This is true likewise of great and small subdivisions\r\nof the public.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel must take into account that many groups\r\nexist, and that there is a very definite interlapping of groups.\r\nBecause of this he is enabled to utilize many types of appeal in\r\nreaching any one group, which he sub-divides for his purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Federation for the Support of Jewish Charities recently instituted\r\na campaign to raise millions of dollars for what it called its\r\nUnited Building Fund. The directors of that campaign might have\r\nsubdivided society for their purpose into two groups, the Jewish and\r\nthe non-Jewish group, or they might have decided that there were\r\nrich people who could give and poor people who could not give. But\r\nthey realized the interlapping nature of the groups they wanted to\r\nreach. They analyzed these component groups closely and divided them\r\ninto groups which had common business interests. For instance, they\r\norganized a group of dentists, a group of bankers, a group of real\r\nestate operators, a group of cloak-and-suit-house operators, a group of\r\nmotion picture and theatrical owners and others.\r\n\r\nThrough an approach to each group on the strongest appeal to which the\r\nmembers of the group as a group would respond, the charity received the\r\nsupport of the individuals who made it up. The social aspirations of\r\nthe group, the ambitions for leadership of the group, the competitive\r\ndesires and philanthropic tendencies of the individuals who made up\r\nthese groups were capitalized.\r\n\r\nThe interlapping nature of these groups made it possible, too, for the\r\npublic relations counsel to reach all the individuals by appeals that\r\nwere directed not merely to the individual as a member of the business\r\ngroup with which he was aligned, but also as a member of a different\r\ngroup. For instance, as a humanitarian, as a public-spirited citizen,\r\nor as a devoted Jew. Because of this interlapping characteristic of\r\ngroups, the organization was able to accomplish its purpose more\r\nsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nSociety is made up of an almost infinite number of groups, whose\r\nvarious interests and desires overlap and interweave inextricably. The\r\nsame man may be at the same time the member of a minority religious\r\nsect, supporter of the dominant political party, a worker in the sense\r\nthat he earns his living primarily by his labor, and a capitalist in\r\nthe sense that he has rents from real estate investments or interest\r\nfrom financial investments. In an issue which involves his religious\r\nsect he will align himself with one group. In an issue which involves\r\nthe choice of a President of the United States he aligns himself with\r\nanother group. In an industrial issue between capital and labor it\r\nmight be very nearly impossible to estimate in advance how he would\r\nalign himself. It is from the constant interplay of these groups and of\r\ntheir conflicting interests upon each other that progress results, and\r\nit is this fact that the public relations counsel takes into account\r\nin pleading his cause. A movement called “The Go-Getters,” instituted\r\nby a magazine, as much to keep itself before the public eye as to\r\nstimulate commercial activity, found rapid acceptance throughout the\r\ncountry because it appealed to trades of every description, because\r\neach group had among its members men who belonged also to a large\r\ngroup, the group of salesmen.\r\n\r\nLet us examine for a moment the personnel of the Horseshoe at the\r\nMetropolitan Opera House. It is composed of people who are rich,\r\nbut this economic classification is only one, for the men and women\r\nwho assemble there are presumably music lovers. But we may again\r\nbreak up this classification of music lovers and discover that\r\nthis group contains art lovers as well. It contains sportsmen. It\r\ncontains merchants and bankers. There are philosophers in it. There\r\nare motorists and amateur farmers. When the Russian Ballet came to\r\nAmerica the essential parts of this group attended the performances,\r\nbut in going after his public, the public relations counsel based his\r\nactions upon the interlapping of groups, and appealed to his entire\r\npossible audience through their various interlapping group interests.\r\nThe art lover had been stimulated by hearing of the Ballet through\r\nhis art group or the art publications and by seeing pictures of the\r\ncostumes and the settings. The music lover, who might have had his\r\ninterest stimulated through seeing a photograph, also had his interest\r\nstimulated by reading about the music.\r\n\r\nEvery individual heard of the Russian Ballet in terms of one or more\r\ndifferent appeals and responded to the Ballet because of these appeals.\r\nIt is naturally difficult to say which one of them had its strongest\r\neffect upon the individual’s mind. There was no doubt, however, that\r\nthe interlapping group formation of society made it possible for more\r\nto be reached and to be moved than would have been the case if the\r\nBallet had been projected on the world at large only as a well-balanced\r\nartistic performance.\r\n\r\nThe utilization of this characteristic of society was shown recently in\r\nthe activities of a silk firm which desired to intensify the interest\r\nof the public in silks. It realized that fundamentally women were its\r\npotential buying public, but it understood, too, that the women who\r\nmade up this public were members of other groups as well. Thus, to\r\nthe members of women’s clubs, silk was projected as the embodiment of\r\nfashion. To those women who visited museums, silk was displayed there\r\nas art. To the schools in the same town, perhaps, silk became a lesson\r\nin the natural history of the silkworm. To art clubs, silk became color\r\nand design. To newspapers, the events that transpired in the silk\r\nmills became news matters of importance.\r\n\r\nEach group of women was appealed to on the basis of its greatest\r\ninterest. The school teacher was appealed to in the schoolroom as an\r\neducator, and after school hours as a member of a women’s club. She\r\nread the advertisements about silk as a woman reader of the newspapers,\r\nand as a member of the women’s group which visited the museums, saw\r\nthe silk there. The woman who stayed at home was brought into contact\r\nwith the silk through her child. All these groups made up the potential\r\nmarket for silk, reached in this way in terms of many appeals to each\r\nindividual. These are the implications present for the public relations\r\ncounsel, who must take into account the interchange and interplay of\r\ngroups in pleading his cause.\r\n\r\nFor society, the interesting outcome of this situation is that progress\r\nseldom occurs through the abrupt expulsion by a group of its old ideas\r\nin favor of new ideas, but rather through the rearrangement of the\r\nthought of the individuals in these groups with respect to each other\r\nand with respect to the entire membership of society.\r\n\r\nIt is precisely this interlapping of groups--the variety, the\r\ninconsistency of the average man’s mental, social and psychological\r\ncommitments which makes possible the gradual change from one state\r\nof affairs or from one state of mind to another. Few people are life\r\nmembers of one group and of one group only. The ordinary person is a\r\nvery temporary member of a great number of groups. This is one of the\r\nmost powerful forces making for progress in society because it makes\r\nfor receptivity and open-mindedness. The modification which results\r\nfrom the inconstancy of individual commitments may be accelerated\r\nand directed by conscious effort. These changes which come about so\r\nstealthily that they remain unobserved in society until long after they\r\nhave taken place, can be made to yield results in chosen directions.\r\n\r\nChanged external conditions must be taken into account by the public\r\nrelations counsel in his work.\r\n\r\nSuch changes carry with them modifications in the interests and points\r\nof view of those they affect. They make it possible to modify group and\r\nindividual reaction. The public relations counsel, too, can modify the\r\nresults of the changed external condition by calling attention to it or\r\ninterpreting it in terms of the interest of those affected.\r\n\r\nThe radio might be taken as an example. In considering the radio from\r\nthe standpoint of his work, the public relations counsel has a new\r\nmedium which can readily reach huge sections of the public with his\r\nmessage. The public relations counsel must be ready to estimate, too,\r\nwhat difference in viewpoint the radio will produce or has produced in\r\nany given section of the public it reaches. He will have to consider,\r\nfor instance, that due to it the average farmer is much more closely in\r\ncontact with the world’s events than formerly.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the radio, too, if his clients be, for instance, large\r\nmanufacturers of radio supplies and demand acceleration of this changed\r\nexternal condition in order to increase their business, he may enlarge\r\nthe radio’s field, activity and effectiveness. Or, he may stress to\r\nthe public the importance of this new instrument and strengthen its\r\nprestige, so that it may better fulfill its mission as a modifier of\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nChanged conditions can make possible modifications in the public point\r\nof view, as can be instanced by a campaign carried on by savings\r\nbanks to encourage thrift. This campaign was successful at that time\r\nbecause inflation made it easy for the public to see the wisdom of the\r\ndoctrines preached and to act upon them.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this modification in the public point of view due to\r\na changed condition was the demand made by the Executive Committee of\r\nthe Central Trades and Labor Council of New York for the government to\r\ntake over the railways of the country. Public ownership had been a pet\r\nsubject for school debate for more than two decades, but it had seldom\r\npassed into the field of serious consideration by the general public.\r\nYet the conditions of hardship created by the last strike of the\r\nrailroad shopmen caused a much greater receptivity in the public mind\r\nto this idea.\r\n\r\nThe airplane slowly emerges as an important factor in the daily life\r\nof the people. What it will mean in the psychology of the nation when\r\ncommuters can settle within a radius of a hundred or more miles of\r\ncities is only to be guessed at. Cities may cease to exist except as\r\nindustrial centers. There will be greater groups and broader interests.\r\nThere will be fewer geographic divisions.\r\n\r\nWhen the automobile was first used motoring was a dangerous and\r\nthrilling sport. To-day it is found that the automobile has altered the\r\nfundamental conception of daily life held by thousands of people, both\r\nin the urban and the rural population. The automobile has removed much\r\nof the isolation of country districts. It has increased the possibility\r\nof education in them. It has caused millions of miles of excellent\r\nroads to be laid.\r\n\r\nChanged conditions can be national or local in their import and\r\nsignificance. They can be as national in scope as the revolutionary\r\nintroduction over night of a national prohibition law or as local as a\r\npolice captain’s edict in Coney Island against stockingless feminine\r\nbathers. But they must be taken into consideration by the public\r\nrelations counsel in his work if they concern in the slightest degree\r\nhis particular public.\r\n\r\nThe basic elements of human nature are fixed as to desires and\r\ninstincts and innate tendencies. The directions, however, in which\r\nthese basic elements may be turned by skillful handling are infinite.\r\nHuman nature is readily subject to modification. Many psychologists\r\nhave attempted to define the component parts of human nature, and while\r\ntheir terminology is not the same, they do follow more or less the same\r\ngeneral outlines.\r\n\r\nAmong the universal instincts are--self-preservation, which includes\r\nthe desire for shelter, sex hunger and food hunger. It is only\r\nnecessary to look through the pages of any magazine to see the way\r\nin which modern business avails itself of these three fundamentals\r\nto exert a coercive force upon the public it is trying to reach. The\r\nAmerican Radiator advertisement with its cozy home, the family gathered\r\naround the radiator, the storm raging outside, definitely makes its\r\nappeal to the universal desire for shelter.\r\n\r\nThe Gulden Mustard advertisements with their graphic delineation of\r\ncold cuts and an inviting glass of what is presumably near-beer\r\ndefinitely appeal to our gustatory sense.\r\n\r\nAs for the sex appeal, the soap advertisements run a veritable race\r\nwith these ends in view. Woodbury’s “the skin you love to touch” is a\r\ngraphic illustration.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of self-preservation, one of the most basic of human\r\ninstincts, is most flexible. The dispensers of raisins, upon the\r\nadvice of an expert on public opinion, adopted a slogan to appeal\r\nto this instinct: “Have you had your iron to-day?”--iron presumably\r\nstrengthening a man and increasing his powers of resistance. The same\r\nman appealed to here will respond to the sales talk which persuades him\r\nthat insurance may save him at a time of need.\r\n\r\nAn important hair-net manufacturer wanted to increase the sales of\r\nhis product. The public relations counsel, therefore, appealed to the\r\ninstinct of self-preservation of large groups of the public. He talked\r\nof self-preservation with respect to hygiene for food dispensers. He\r\ntalked of self-preservation with respect to safety for women who work\r\nnear exposed machinery.\r\n\r\nThe same instinct of preservation which may cause a worker to give up\r\nnecessary food so that he may save a little money will cause him to\r\ncontribute money to a common fund if he can be shown that this too is a\r\nsafety measure.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel extracts from his clients’ causes ideas\r\nwhich will capitalize certain fundamental instincts in the people he\r\nis trying to reach, and then sets about to project these ideas to his\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWilliam MacDougall, the psychologist, classifies seven\r\nprimary instincts with their attendant emotions. They\r\nare flight-fear, repulsion-disgust, curiosity-wonder,\r\npugnacity-anger, self-display-elation, self-abasement-subjection,\r\nparental-love-tenderness. These instincts are utilized by the public\r\nrelations counsel in developing ideas and emotions which will modify\r\nthe opinions and actions of his public.\r\n\r\nThe action of public health officials in stressing the possibility of\r\na plague or epidemic is effective because it appeals to the emotion\r\nof fear, and presents the possibility of preventing the spread of the\r\nepidemic or plague. Of course, the element of flight in this particular\r\nsituation is not one of movement, but of a desire to get away from the\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of repulsion with its attendant emotion of disgust is not\r\noften called upon by the public relations counsel in his work.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, curiosity and wonder are continually employed. In\r\nGovernmental work, particularly, the statesman who has an announcement\r\nto make is continually exhausting every effort to arouse public\r\ninterest in advance of the actual announcement. Feelers are often sent\r\nout to the public to help create curiosity.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note, too, that even book publishers rely upon the\r\nelement of wonder, termed suspense in drama, to increase their public\r\nand their sales. Our now famous “What is wrong with this picture?”\r\nadvertisements, and those used for the O. Henry books illustrate this\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nPugnacity with its attendant emotion of anger is a human constant.\r\nThe public relations counsel uses this continually in constructing\r\nall kinds of events that will call it into play. Because of it, too,\r\nhe is often forced to enact combats and create issues. He stages\r\nbattles against evils in which the antagonist is personified for\r\nthe public. New York City, when it wants to reduce the death rate\r\nfrom tuberculosis, aligns its citizens yearly in a fight against the\r\ndisease and continues the idea of combat by announcing the number of\r\nvictims from year to year. It uses the terminology of warfare in these\r\nbulletins. Such phrases in this or other health campaigns as “kill the\r\ngerms,” “swat the fly,” illustrate this point. The public responds to\r\na battle in a way that it might not respond to a plea to take care of\r\nitself or to do its civic duty.\r\n\r\nUnder pugnacity would come that technique of the public relations\r\ncounsel which is continually devising tests and contests. Mr. Martin,\r\nin his experience as director of the Cooper Union Forum, noticed that\r\nthe sort of interest which will most easily bring an assemblage of\r\npeople together is most commonly an issue of some kind.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, says Mr. Martin:[28] “I have seen efforts made in New\r\nYork to hold mass meetings to discuss affairs of the very greatest\r\nimportance, and I have noted the fact that such efforts usually fail\r\nto get out more than a handful of specially interested persons, no\r\nmatter how well advertised, if the subject to be considered happens\r\nnot to be of a controversial nature. On the other hand, if the matter\r\nto be considered is one about which there is keen partisan feeling and\r\npopular resentment--if it lends itself to the spectacular personal\r\nachievement of one whose name is known, especially in the face of\r\nopposition or difficulties--or if the occasion permits of resolutions\r\nof protest, of the airing of wrongs, of denouncing a business of some\r\nkind, or of casting statements of external principles in the teeth of\r\n‘enemies of humanity,’ then, however trivial the occasion, we may count\r\non it that our meeting will be well attended.\r\n\r\n“It is this element of conflict, directly or indirectly, which plays\r\nan overwhelming part in the psychology of every crowd. It is the\r\nelement of contest which makes baseball so popular. A debate will\r\ndraw a larger crowd than a lecture. One of the secrets of the large\r\nattendance of the forum is the fact that discussion--‘talking back’--is\r\npermitted and encouraged. The Evangelist Sunday undoubtedly owes the\r\ngreat attendance at his meetings in no small degree to the fact that he\r\nis regularly expected to abuse some one.\r\n\r\n“Nothing so easily catches general attention and creates a crowd as a\r\ncontest of any kind. The crowd unconsciously identifies its members\r\nwith one or the other competitor. Success enables the winning crowd\r\nto ‘crow’ over the losers. Such an occasion becomes symbolic and is\r\nutilized by the ego to enhance its feeling of importance.”\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel finds in the instinct of pugnacity a\r\npowerful weapon for enlisting public support for or public opposition\r\nto a point of view in which he is interested. On this principle, he\r\nwill, whenever possible, state his case in the form of an issue and\r\nenlist, in support of his side, such forces as are available.\r\n\r\nThe dangers of the method must be recognized and borne in mind.\r\nPugnacity can be enlisted on the side of decency and progress. He who\r\nlooks at it from that point of view will agree with Mr. Pulitzer,\r\nthe great publisher, that it seems neither extraordinary nor culpable\r\nthat “people and press should be more interested in the polemical than\r\nin the platitudinous; in blame than in painting the lily; in attack\r\nthan in sending laudatory coals to Newcastle.” On the other hand, the\r\ninstinct of pugnacity can be utilized to suppress and to oppress. From\r\nthe point of view of the public relations counsel, who is interested\r\nfrom day to day in accomplishing definite results on specific issues,\r\nthe dangers of the method are only the ordinary dangers of every\r\nweapon, physical or psychological, which has been devised.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting in this connection to note that a newspaper uses\r\nthe same methods to encourage interest in itself as do others. The\r\n_New York Times_ promoted public interest in heavier-than-air-machines\r\nby creating sporting issues of contests between aviators on altitude\r\nrecords, continuous stays in the air, distance flying and so forth.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippmann comments on this same characteristic:\r\n\r\n“But where pugnacity is not enlisted, those of us who are not directly\r\ninvolved find it hard to keep up our interest. For those who are\r\ninvolved the absorption may be real enough to hold them even when no\r\nissue is involved. They may be exercised by sheer joy in activity or\r\nby subtle rivalry or invention. But for those to whom the whole problem\r\nis external and distant, these other faculties do not easily come into\r\nplay. In order that the faint image of the affair shall mean something\r\nto them, they must be allowed to exercise the love of struggle,\r\nsuspense, and victory.”[29]\r\n\r\nWe have to take sides. We have to be able to take sides. In the\r\nrecesses of our being we must step out of the audience onto the stage\r\nand wrestle as the hero for the victory of good over evil. We must\r\nbreathe into the allegory the breath of our life.\r\n\r\nRecently a philanthropic group was advised to hold a prize fight\r\nfor charity. This recognition of the importance of the principle of\r\npugnacity was correct. It is a question whether the application was\r\nnot somewhat ill advised and in bad taste. The Consumer’s Committee\r\nof Women opposed to American Valuation was avowedly aligned to fight\r\nagainst a section of the tariff presented by Chairman Fordney. The Lucy\r\nStone League, a group who wish to make it easy for married women to\r\nmaintain their maiden names, dramatized the fight that they are making\r\nagainst tradition by staging a debate at their annual banquet.\r\n\r\nVery often the public relations counsel utilizes the\r\nself-display-elation motive and draws public attention to particular\r\npeople in groups, in order to give them a greater interest in the\r\nwork they are espousing. It is often found to be true that when a\r\nman’s adherence or allegiance to a movement is lukewarm and he is\r\npublicly praised for his adherence to it, he will become a forceful\r\nfactor in it. That is why the intelligent hospital boards name rooms\r\nor beds after their donors. It is one of the reasons for the elaborate\r\nletterheads so many of our philanthropic organizations have.\r\n\r\nSelf-abasement and subjection, its attendant emotion, are seldom called\r\nupon. On the other hand, parental love and tenderness are continually\r\nemployed, viz., the effort of the baby-kissing candidate for public\r\noffice or the attempt to popularize a brand of silk by having a child\r\npresent a silk flag to a war veteran at a public ceremony. The whole\r\nflood of post-war charity-drives was keyed to this pitch. The starving\r\nBelgian orphan personified in every picture, the starving Armenian, and\r\nthen the hungry Austrian and German orphans appeared, and the campaigns\r\nall succeeded on this issue. Even issues where the child was not the\r\npredominant factor used this appeal.\r\n\r\nFour other instincts are listed in this\r\nclassification--gregariousness, individualism, acquisition and\r\nconstruction. We have already dealt with the first at length.\r\n\r\nThe gregarious instinct in man gives the public relations counsel\r\nthe opportunity for his most potent work. The group and herd show\r\neverywhere the leader, who because of certain qualifications, certain\r\npoints that are judged by the herd to be important to its life, stands\r\nout and is followed more or less implicitly by it.\r\n\r\nA group leader gains such power with his group or herd that even on\r\nmatters which have had nothing to do with the establishment or gaining\r\nof that leadership he is considered a leader and is followed by his\r\ngroup.\r\n\r\nIt is this attribute of men and women that again gives the public\r\nrelations counsel free play.\r\n\r\nA group leader of any given cause will bring to a new cause all those\r\nwho have looked to his leadership. For instance, if the adherence\r\nof a prominent Republican is secured for the League of Nations, his\r\nadherence will probably bring to the League of Nations many other\r\nprominent Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe group leadership with which the public relations counsel may work\r\nis limited only by the character of the groups he desires to reach.\r\nAfter an analysis of his problem the subdivisions must be made. His\r\naction depends upon his selective capacity, and the possibility of\r\napproach to the leaders. These leaders may represent therefore a wide\r\nvariety of interests--society leaders or leaders of political groups,\r\nleaders of women or leaders of sportsmen, leaders of divisions by\r\ngeography, or divisions by age, divisions by language or by education.\r\nThese subdivisions are so numerous that there are large companies in\r\nthe United States whose business it is to supply lists of groups and\r\ngroup leaders in different fields.\r\n\r\nThis same mechanism is carried out in many other cases. In looking for\r\ngroup leaders, the public relations counsel must realize that some\r\nleaders have more varied and more intensified authority than others.\r\nOne leader may represent the ideals and ideas of several or numerous\r\ngroups. His coöperation on one basis may bring into alignment and may\r\ncarry with it the other groups who are interested in him primarily for\r\nother reasons.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel, let us say, enlists the support of a\r\nman, president of two associations; (a) an economic association, (b)\r\na welfare association. The issue is an economic one, purely. But\r\nbecause of his leadership, the membership of association (b), that\r\nis, the welfare group, joins him in the movement as interestedly as\r\nassociation (a) does, which has the more logical, direct reason for\r\nentering the field.\r\n\r\nI have given this in general terms rather than as a specific instance.\r\nThe principle which governs the interlapping and continually shifting\r\ngroup formation of society also governs the gregariousness.\r\n\r\nIndividualism, another instinct, is a concomitant of gregariousness,\r\nand naturally follows it. The desire for individual expression is\r\nalways a trait of the individuals who go to make up the group. The\r\nappeal to individualism goes closely in hand with other instincts, such\r\nas self-display.\r\n\r\nThe instincts of acquisition and construction are minor instincts as\r\nfar as the ordinary work of the public relations counsel is concerned.\r\nExamples of this type of appeal come readily to mind in the “Own your\r\nown home” and “Build your own home” campaigns.\r\n\r\nThe innate tendencies are susceptibility to suggestion, imitation,\r\nhabit and play. Susceptibility to suggestion and imitation might well\r\nbe classified under gregariousness, which we have already discussed.\r\n\r\nUnder habit would come one very important human trait of which the\r\npublic relations counsel avails himself continually. The mechanism\r\nwhich habit produces and which makes it possible for the public\r\nrelations counsel to use habit is the stereotype we have already\r\ntouched upon.\r\n\r\nMental habits create stereotypes just as physical habits create certain\r\ndefinite reflex actions. These stereotypes or reflex images are a great\r\naid to the public relations counsel in his work.\r\n\r\nThese short-cuts to reactions make it possible for the average mind\r\nto possess a much larger number of impressions than would be possible\r\nwithout them. At the same time these stereotypes or _clichés_ are not\r\nnecessarily truthful pictures of what they are supposed to portray.\r\nThey are determined by the outward stimuli to which the individual has\r\nbeen subject as well as by the content of his mind.\r\n\r\nTo most of us, for example, the stereotype of the general is a stern,\r\nupright gentleman in uniform and with gold braid, preferably on a\r\nhorse. The stereotype of a farmer is a slouching, overall-clad man\r\nwith straw sticking out of his mouth and a straw hat on his head. He\r\nis supposed to be very shrewd when it comes to matters of his own farm\r\nand very ignorant when it comes to matters of culture. He despises\r\n“city fellers.” All this is the connotation brought up by the one word\r\n“farmer.”\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel sometimes uses the current stereotypes,\r\nsometimes combats them and sometimes creates new ones. In using them\r\nhe very often brings to the public he is reaching a stereotype they\r\nalready know, to which he adds his new ideas, thus he fortifies his\r\nown and gives a greater carrying power. For instance, the public\r\nrelations counsel might well advise Austria, which in the public mind\r\nmight still represent a belligerent country, to bring forward other\r\nAustrian stereotypes, namely the Danube waltz stereotype and the Danube\r\nblue stereotype. An appeal for help would then come from the country\r\nof the well-liked Danube waltz and Danube blue--the country of gayety\r\nand charm. The new idea would be carried to those who accepted the\r\nstereotypes they were familiar with.\r\n\r\nThe combating of the stereotype is seen in the battle waged against\r\nthe American Valuation Plan by the public relations counsel. The\r\nformulators of the plan dubbed it “American Valuation” in order to\r\ncapitalize on the stereotype of “American.” In fighting the plan, its\r\nopponents put the word “American” in quotation marks whenever reference\r\nwas made to the subject in order to question the authenticity of the\r\nuse of this stereotype. Thus patriotism was definitely removed from\r\nwhat was evidently an economical and political issue.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel creates new stereotypes. Roosevelt, his\r\nown best adviser, was an apt creator of such stereotypes--“square\r\ndeal, de-lighted, molly-coddle, big stick,” created new concepts for\r\ngeneral acceptance.\r\n\r\nStereotypes sometimes become shop-worn and lose their power with the\r\npublic that has previously accepted them. “Hundred per cent American”\r\ndied from over use.\r\n\r\nVisible objects as stereotypes are often used by the public relations\r\ncounsel with great effectiveness to produce the desired impression.\r\nA national flag on the orator’s platform is a most common device. A\r\nscientist must of necessity be in juxtaposition with his instruments.\r\nA chemist is not a chemist to the public unless test tubes and\r\nretorts are near him. A doctor must have his kit, or, formerly, a\r\nVan Dyke beard. In photographs of food factory buildings white is a\r\ngood stereotype for cleanliness and purity. In fact, all emblems and\r\ntrade-marks are stereotypes.\r\n\r\nThere is one danger in the use of stereotypes by the public relations\r\ncounsel. That is, by the substitution of words for acts, demagogues in\r\nevery field of social relationship can take advantage of the public.\r\n\r\nPlay as an innate tendency is utilized by the public relations counsel\r\nwhenever conditions merit such an appeal. When a charity committee is\r\nadvised to institute a street fair to gather money, the committee is\r\nrecognizing this tendency. When a city government arranges fireworks\r\nfor its citizens, when a metropolitan news-daily stages marble contests\r\nor horseshoe pitching events, the play tendency of human society finds\r\nan outlet and the initiators of the event find friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nAN OUTLINE OF METHODS PRACTICABLE IN MODIFYING THE POINT OF VIEW OF A\r\nGROUP\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the question of specific devices upon which the public relations\r\ncounsel relies to accomplish his ends, volumes could probably be\r\nwritten without exhausting the subject. The detailed presentation\r\nis potentially endless. Pages could be filled with instances of the\r\nstimuli to which men and women respond, the circumstances under\r\nwhich they will respond favorably or unfavorably, and the particular\r\napplication of each of these stimuli to concrete conditions. Such\r\nan outline, however, would have less value than an outline of\r\nfundamentals, since circumstances are never the same.\r\n\r\nThese principles, by and large, consist of fundamentals already\r\ndefined, to which the public relations counsel has recourse in common\r\nwith the statesman, the journalist, the preacher, the lecturer and all\r\nothers engaged in attempting to modify public opinion or public conduct.\r\n\r\nHow does the public relations counsel approach any particular problem?\r\nFirst he must analyze his client’s problem and his client’s objective.\r\nThen he must analyze the public he is trying to reach. He must devise a\r\nplan of action for the client to follow and determine the methods and\r\nthe organs of distribution available for reaching his public. Finally\r\nhe must try to estimate the interaction between the public he seeks\r\nto reach and his client. How will his client’s case strike the public\r\nmind? And by public mind here is meant that section or those sections\r\nof the public which must be reached.\r\n\r\nLet us take the example of a public relations counsel who is confronted\r\nwith the specific problem of modifying or influencing the attitude\r\nof the public toward a given tariff bill. A tariff bill, of course,\r\nis primarily the application of theoretical economics to a concrete\r\nindustrial situation. The public relations counsel in analyzing must\r\nsee himself simultaneously as a member of a large number of publics. He\r\nmust visualize himself as a manufacturer, a retailer, an importer, an\r\nemployer, a worker, a financier, a politician.\r\n\r\nWithin these groups he must see himself again as a member of the\r\nvarious subdivisions of each of these groups. He must see himself, for\r\nexample, as a member of a group of manufacturers who obtain the bulk of\r\ntheir raw material within the United States, and at the same time as a\r\nmember of a group of manufacturers who obtain large portions of their\r\nraw material from abroad and whose importations of raw material may be\r\nadversely affected by the pending tariff bill. He must see himself not\r\nonly as a farm laborer but also as a mechanic in a large industrial\r\ncenter. He must see himself as the owner of the department store and as\r\na member of the buying public. He must be able to generalize, as far as\r\npossible, from these points of view in order to strike upon the appeal\r\nor group of appeals which will be influential with as many sections of\r\nsociety as possible.[30]\r\n\r\nLet us assume that our problem is the intensification in the public\r\nmind of the prestige of a hotel. The problem for the public relations\r\ncounsel is to create in the public mind the close relationship between\r\nthe hotel and a number of ideas that represent the things the hotel\r\ndesires to stand for in the public mind.\r\n\r\nThe counsel therefore advises the hotel to make a celebration of its\r\nthirtieth anniversary which happens to fall at this particular time\r\nand suggests to the president the organization of an anniversary\r\ncommittee of a body of business men who represent the cream of the\r\ncity’s merchants. This committee is to include men who represent a\r\nnumber of stereotypes that will help to produce the inevitable result\r\nin the public mind. There are to be also a leading banker, a society\r\nwoman, a prominent lawyer, an influential preacher, and so forth until\r\na cross section of the city’s most telling activities is mirrored in\r\nthe committee. The stereotype has its effect, and what may have been an\r\nindefinite impression beforehand has been reënforced and concretized.\r\nThe hotel remains preëminent in the public mind. The stereotypes have\r\nproved its preëminence. The cause has been strongly presented to the\r\npublic by identification with different group stereotypes.\r\n\r\nHere is another example. A packing company desires to establish in the\r\npublic mind the fact that the name of its product is synonymous with\r\nbacon. Its public relations counsel advises a contest on “Bring home\r\nthe Beech-Nut,” the contest to be open to salesmen and to be based on\r\nthe best sale made by salesmen throughout the country during the month\r\nof August. But here again it is necessary to use a stereotype to help\r\nthe possible contestant identify the cause. A committee of nationally\r\nknown sales-managers is chosen to act as judges for the contest and\r\nimmediately success is assured. Thousands of salesmen compete for the\r\nprize. The stereotype has bespoken the value of the contest.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel can try to bring about this identification\r\nby utilizing the appeals to desires and instincts discussed in the\r\npreceding chapter, and by making use of the characteristics of the\r\ngroup formation of society. His utilization of these basic principles\r\nwill be a continual and efficient aid to him.\r\n\r\nHe must make it easy for the public to pick his issue out of the great\r\nmass of material. He must be able to overcome what has been called “the\r\ntendency on the part of public attention to ‘flicker’ and ‘relax.’” He\r\nmust do for the public mind what the newspaper, with its headlines,\r\naccomplishes for its readers.\r\n\r\nAbstract discussions and heavy facts are the groundwork of his involved\r\ntheory, or analysis, but they cannot be given to the public until\r\nthey are simplified and dramatized. The refinements of reason and the\r\nshadings of emotion cannot reach a considerable public.\r\n\r\nWhen an appeal to the instincts can be made so powerful as to secure\r\nacceptance in the medium of dissemination in spite of competitive\r\ninterests, it can be aptly termed news.\r\n\r\nThe public relations counsel, therefore, is a creator of news for\r\nwhatever medium he chooses to transmit his ideas. It is his duty to\r\ncreate news no matter what the medium which broadcasts this news.\r\nIt is news interest which gives him an opportunity to make his idea\r\ntravel and get the favorable reaction from the instincts to which he\r\nhappens to appeal. News in itself we shall define later on when we\r\ndiscuss “relations with the press.” But the word news is sufficiently\r\nunderstood for me to talk of it here.\r\n\r\nIn order to appeal to the instincts and fundamental emotions of the\r\npublic, discussed in previous chapters, the public relations counsel\r\nmust create news around his ideas. News will, by its superior inherent\r\ninterest, receive attention in the competitive markets for news, which\r\nare themselves continually trying to claim the public attention. The\r\npublic relations counsel must lift startling facts from his whole\r\nsubject and present them as news. He must isolate ideas and develop\r\nthem into events so that they can be more readily understood and so\r\nthat they may claim attention as news.\r\n\r\nThe headline and the cartoon bear the same relation to the newspaper\r\nthat the public relations counsel’s analysis of a problem bears to the\r\nproblem itself.\r\n\r\nThe headline is a compact, vivid simplification of complicated issues.\r\nThe cartoon provides a visual image which takes the place of abstract\r\nthought. So, too, the analyses the public relations counsel makes,\r\nlift out the important, the interesting, and the easily understandable\r\npoints in order to create interest.\r\n\r\n“Yet human qualities are themselves,” says Mr. Lippmann,[31] “vague and\r\nfluctuating. They are best remembered by a physical sign. And therefore\r\nthe human qualities we tend to ascribe to the names of our impressions,\r\nthemselves tend to be visualized in physical metaphors. The people of\r\nEngland, the history of England, condense into England, and England\r\nbecomes John Bull, who is jovial and fat, not too clever, but well able\r\nto take care of himself. The migration of a people may appear to some\r\nas a meandering of a river, and to others like a devastating flood. The\r\ncourage people display may be objectified as a rock, their purpose as\r\na road, their doubts as forks of the road, their difficulties as ruts\r\nand rocks, their progress as a fertile valley. If they mobilize their\r\ndreadnaughts they unsheath a sword. If their army surrenders they are\r\nthrown to earth. If they are oppressed they are on the rack or under\r\nthe harrow.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the chief contribution of the public relations counsel to the\r\npublic and to his client is his ability to understand and analyze\r\nobscure tendencies of the public mind. It is true that he first\r\nanalyzes his client’s problem--he then analyzes the public mind; he\r\nutilizes the mediums of communication between the two, but before he\r\ndoes this he must use his personal experience and knowledge to bring\r\ntwo factors into alignment. It is his capacity for crystallizing the\r\nobscure tendencies of the public mind before they have reached definite\r\nexpression, which makes him so valuable.\r\n\r\nHis ability to create those symbols to which the public is ready to\r\nrespond; his ability to know and to analyze those reactions which\r\nthe public is ready to give; his ability to find those stereotypes,\r\nindividual and community, which will bring favorable responses; his\r\nability to speak in the language of his audience and to receive from it\r\na favorable reception are his contributions.\r\n\r\nThe appeal to the instincts and the universal desires is the basic\r\nmethod through which he produces his results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV\r\n\r\nETHICAL RELATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA CONSIDERATION OF THE PRESS AND OTHER MEDIUMS OF COMMUNICATION IN\r\nTHEIR RELATION TO THE PUBLIC RELATIONS COUNSEL\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the question of preparing and publishing this volume was first\r\nconsidered, the publishers wrote letters to several hundred prominent\r\nmen asking their opinions, individually, as to the probable public\r\ninterest in a work dealing with public relations. Newspaper editors and\r\npublishers, heads of large industries and public service corporations,\r\nphilanthropists, university presidents and heads of schools of\r\njournalism, as well as other prominent men made up the number. Their\r\nreplies are exceedingly interesting in as much as they show, almost\r\nuniformly, the increasing emphasis placed upon public relations by\r\nleaders in every important phase of American life. These replies show\r\nalso a growing understanding of the need for specialized service in\r\nthis field of specialized problems.\r\n\r\nParticularly interesting were the comments of newspaper publishers\r\nand editors in response to Mr. Liveright’s inquiry, for nothing could\r\nbetter indicate the light in which the public relations counsel is held\r\nby those very individuals who are supposed popularly to disparage his\r\nvalue in the social and economic scheme of things.\r\n\r\nWhat are the relations of the public relations counsel to the various\r\nmediums he can employ to carry his message to the public? There is,\r\nof course, first and perhaps most important, the press. There is the\r\nmoving picture; the lecture platform; there is advertising; there is\r\nthe direct-by-mail effort; there is the stage--drama and music; there\r\nis word of mouth; there is the pulpit, the schoolroom, the legislative\r\nchamber--to all of these the public relations counsel has distinct\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nThe journalist of to-day, while still watching the machinations of the\r\nso-called “press agent” with one half-amused eye, appreciates the value\r\nof the service the public relations counsel is able to give him.\r\n\r\nTo the newspaper the public relations counsel serves as a purveyor of\r\nnews.\r\n\r\nAs disseminator of news the newspaper holds an important position in\r\nAmerican life. This has not always been the case, for the emphasis upon\r\nthe news side is a development of recent years. Originally, the name\r\nnewspaper was scarcely an accurate or appropriate designation for\r\nthe units of the American press. So-called newspapers were, in fact,\r\nvehicles for the expression of opinion of their editors. They contained\r\nlittle or no news, as that word is understood to-day--largely because\r\ndifficulties of communication made it impossible to obtain any but the\r\nmost local items of interest. The public was accustomed to look to its\r\npress for the opinion of its favorite editor upon subjects of current\r\ninterest rather than for the recital of mere facts.\r\n\r\nTo-day, on the other hand, the expression of editorial opinion is only\r\nsecondarily the function of a newspaper; and thousands of persons read\r\nnewspapers with whose editorial policy they do not in the slightest\r\nagree. Such a situation would have been nearly impossible in the days\r\nof Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\nThe need which the American press is to-day engaged in satisfying is\r\nthe need for news. “A paper,” says Mr. Given,[32] “may succeed without\r\nprinting editorials worth reading and without having any aim other than\r\nthe making of money, but it cannot possibly thrive unless it gets the\r\nnews and prints it in a pleasing and attractive form.”\r\n\r\nWriting from a long experience with the profession of journalism,\r\nWill Irwin reaches the conclusion that[33] “news is the main thing,\r\nthe vital consideration of the American newspaper; it is both an\r\nintellectual craving and a commercial need to the modern world. In\r\npopular psychology it has come to be a crying primal want of the mind,\r\nlike hunger of the body. Tramp windjammers, taking on the pilot after\r\na long cruise, ask for the papers before they ask, as formerly, for\r\nfresh fruit and vegetables. Whenever, in our later Western advance,\r\nwe Americans set up a new mining camp, an editor, his type slung\r\non burro-back, comes in with the missionaries, evangel himself of\r\ncivilization. Most dramatically the San Francisco disaster illuminated\r\nthis point. On the morning of April 20, 1906, the city’s population\r\nhuddled in parks and squares, their houses gone, death of famine or\r\nthirst a rumor and a possibility. The editors of the three morning\r\nnewspapers, expressing the true soldier spirit which inspires this most\r\ndevoted profession, had moved their staffs to the suburb of Oakland,\r\nand there, on the presses of the _Tribune_, they had issued a combined\r\n_Call-Chronicle-Examiner_. When, at dawn, the paper was printed, an\r\neditor and a reporter loaded the edition into an automobile and drove\r\nit through the parks of the disordered city, giving copies away. They\r\nwere fairly mobbed, they had to drive at top speed, casting out the\r\nsheets as they went, to make any progress at all. No bread wagon, no\r\nsupply of blankets, caused half so much stir as did the arrival of the\r\nnews.\r\n\r\n“We need it, we crave it; this nerve of the modern world transmits\r\nthought and impulse from the brain of humanity to its muscles; the\r\ncomplex organism of modern society could no more move without it than\r\na man could move without filaments and ganglia. On the commercial\r\nand practical side, the man of even small affairs must read news\r\nin the newspapers every day to keep informed on the thousand and\r\none activities in the social structure which affect his business.\r\nOn the intellectual and spiritual side, it is--save for the Church\r\nalone--our principal outlook on the higher intelligence. The thought\r\nof legislature, university, study, and pulpit comes to the common man\r\nfirst--and usually last--in the form of news. The tedious business of\r\nteaching reading in public schools has become chiefly a training to\r\nconsume newspapers. We must go far up in the scale of culture before we\r\nfind an intellectual equipment more a debtor to the formal education of\r\nschool and college than to the haphazard education of news.”\r\n\r\nThe extent to which the editorial aspect of the newspaper has given way\r\nto an increased importance of the news columns is vividly illustrated\r\nin the anecdote about the _Philadelphia North American_, which Mr.\r\nIrwin relates. “The _North American_,” says Mr. Irwin, “had declared\r\nfor local option. A committee of brewers waited on the editor; they\r\nrepresented one of the biggest groups in their business. ‘This is\r\nan ultimatum,’ they said. ‘You must change your policy or lose our\r\nadvertising. We’ll be easy on you. We don’t ask you to alter your\r\neditorial policy, _but you must stop printing news of local-option\r\nvictories_.’[34] So the deepest and shrewdest enemies of the body\r\npolitic give practical testimony to the ‘power of the press’ in its\r\nmodern form.”\r\n\r\nIn the case of the brewers of Philadelphia it is my own opinion that\r\nif they had been well advised, instead of attempting to interfere with\r\nthe policy of the _North American_, they would have made it a point to\r\nbring to the attention of the _North American_ every instance of the\r\ndefeat of local option. The newspaper would undoubtedly have published\r\nboth sides of the story, as far as both sides consisted of news.\r\n\r\nIt is because he acts as the purveyor of truthful, accurate\r\nand verifiable news to the press that the conscientious and\r\nsuccessful counsel on public relations is looked upon with favor\r\nby the journalist. And in the Code of Ethics recently adopted in\r\nWashington by a national editors’ conference, his function is given\r\nacknowledgment. Just as in the case of the other mediums for the\r\ndissemination of information, mediums which range from the lecture\r\nplatform to the radio, the press, too, looks to the public relations\r\ncounsel for information about the causes he represents.\r\n\r\nSince news is the newspaper’s backbone, it is obvious that an\r\nunderstanding of what news actually is must be an integral part of the\r\nequipment of the public relations counsel. For the public relations\r\ncounsel must not only supply news--he must create news. This function\r\nas the creator of news is even more important than his others.\r\n\r\nIt has always been interesting to me that a concise, comprehensive\r\ndefinition of news has never been written. What news is, every\r\nnewspaper man instinctively knows, particularly as it concerns the\r\nneeds of his own paper. But it is almost as difficult to define news\r\nas it is to describe a circular staircase without making corkscrew\r\ngestures with one’s hand, or as to define some of the abstruse concepts\r\nof the metaphysician, like space or time or reality.\r\n\r\nWhat is news for one newspaper may have no interest whatever, or very\r\nlittle interest, for another newspaper. There are almost as many\r\ndefinitions of news as there are journalists who take the trouble\r\nto define it. Certain of the characteristics of news, of course, can\r\nbe readily seized upon; and definitions of news generally consist of\r\nparticular emphasis upon one or another of these characteristics. Mr.\r\nGiven remarks that[35] “news was once defined as ‘Fresh information\r\nof something that has lately taken place.’...” The author of this\r\ndefinition puts the chief emphasis upon the element of timeliness.\r\nUndoubtedly in most news that element must be present. It would not be\r\ntrue, however, to say that it must always be present, nor would it be\r\ntrue to say that everything which is timely is news. Obviously, the\r\nwell-nigh infinite number of occurrences which take place in daily life\r\nthroughout the world are timely enough, so far as each of them in its\r\nrespective environment is concerned; but few of them ever become news.\r\n\r\nMr. Irwin defines news as “a departure from the established order.”\r\nThus, according to Mr. Irwin, a criminal act is news because it is\r\na departure from the established order, and at the same time, an\r\nexceptional display of fidelity, courage or honesty is also news for\r\nthe same reason.\r\n\r\n“With our education in established order, we get the knowledge,” he\r\nsays,[36] “that mankind in bulk obeys its ideals of that order only\r\nimperfectly. When something brings to our attention an exceptional\r\nadhesion to religion, virtue, and truth, that becomes in itself a\r\ndeparture from regularity, and therefore news. The knowledge that most\r\nservants do their work conscientiously and many stay long in the same\r\nemploy is not news. But when a committee of housewives presents a\r\nmedal to a servant who has worked faithfully in one employ for fifty\r\nyears, that becomes news, because it calls our attention to a case of\r\nexceptional fidelity to the ideals of established order. The fact that\r\nmankind will consume an undue amount of news about crime and disorder\r\nis only a proof that the average human being is optimistic, that he\r\nbelieves the world to be true, sound and working upward. Crimes and\r\nscandals interest him most because they most disturb his picture of the\r\nestablished order.\r\n\r\n“That, then, is the basis of news. The mysterious news sense which\r\nis necessary to all good reporters rests on no other foundation\r\nthan acquired or instinctive perception of this principle, together\r\nwith a feeling for what the greatest number of people will regard\r\nas a departure from the established order. In Jesse Lynch William’s\r\nnewspaper play, ‘The Stolen Story,’ occurs this passage:\r\n\r\n    “(_Enter Very Young Reporter; comes down to city desk with air\r\n    of excitement._)\r\n\r\n    “VERY YOUNG REPORTER (_considerably impressed_): ‘Big story.\r\n    Three dagoes killed by that boiler explosion!’\r\n\r\n    “THE CITY EDITOR (_reading copy. Doesn’t look up_): ‘Ten\r\n    lines.’ (_Continues reading copy._)\r\n\r\n    “VERY YOUNG REPORTER (_looks surprised and hurt. Crosses over\r\n    to reporter’s table. Then turns back to city desk. Casual\r\n    conversational tone_): ‘By the way. Funny thing. There was a\r\n    baby carriage within fifty feet of the explosion, but it wasn’t\r\n    upset.’\r\n\r\n    “THE CITY EDITOR (_looks up with professional interest_):\r\n    ‘That’s worth a dozen dead dagoes. Write a half column.’\r\n\r\n    “(_Very Young Reporter looks still more surprised, perplexed.\r\n    Suddenly the idea dawns upon him. He crosses over to table,\r\n    sits down, writes._)\r\n\r\n“Both saw news; but the editor went further than the reporter. For\r\ncases of Italians killed by a boiler explosion are so common as to\r\napproach the commonplace; but a freak of explosive chemistry which\r\nannihilates a strong man and does not disturb a baby departs from it\r\nwidely.”\r\n\r\nHere again it is clear that Mr. Irwin has merely emphasized one of the\r\nfeatures generally to be found in what we call news, without, however,\r\noffering us a complete or exclusive definition of news.\r\n\r\nAnalyzing further within his general rule that news is a departure\r\nfrom the established order, Mr. Irwin goes on to point out certain\r\noutstanding factors which enhance or create news value. I cite them\r\nhere because all of them are unquestionably sound. On the other hand,\r\nanalysis shows that some of them are directly contradictory to his main\r\nprinciple that only the departure from the established order is news.\r\nIn Mr. Irwin’s opinion, the four outstanding factors making for the\r\ncreation or enhancement of news value are the following:[37]\r\n\r\n    1. “_We prefer to read about the things we like._” The result,\r\n    he says, has been the rule: “Power for the men, affections for\r\n    the women.”\r\n\r\n    2. “_Our interest in news increases in direct ratio to our\r\n    familiarity with its subject, its setting, and its dramatis\r\n    personæ._”\r\n\r\n    3. “_Our interest in news is in direct ratio to its effect on\r\n    our personal concerns._”\r\n\r\n    4. “_Our interest in news increases in direct ratio to the\r\n    general importance of the persons or activities which it\r\n    affects._” This is so obvious that it scarcely needs comment.\r\n\r\nSome notion of the diversity of news arising in a city may be obtained\r\nif one studies the points which are watched as news sources, either\r\ncontinuously or closely by metropolitan dailies. Mr. Given[38] lists\r\nthe places in New York which are watched constantly:\r\n\r\n    “Police Headquarters.\r\n\r\n    Police Courts.\r\n\r\n    Coroner’s Office.\r\n\r\n    Supreme Courts, New York County.\r\n\r\n    New York Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\n    City Hall, including the Mayor’s Office, Aldermanic Chamber,\r\n    City Clerk’s Office, and Office of the President of Manhattan\r\n    Borough.\r\n\r\n    County Clerk’s office.”\r\n\r\nThose places, says Mr. Given, which the newspapers watch carefully, but\r\nnot continually, are:\r\n\r\n    “City Courts (Minor civil cases).\r\n\r\n    Court of General Sessions (Criminal cases).\r\n\r\n    Court of Special Sessions (Minor criminal cases).\r\n\r\n    District Attorney’s Office.\r\n\r\n    Doors of Grand Jury rooms when the Grand Jury is in session\r\n    (For indictments and presentments).\r\n\r\n    Federal Courts.\r\n\r\n    Post Office.\r\n\r\n    United States Commissioner’s Offices, and Offices of the United\r\n    States Secret Service officers.\r\n\r\n    United States Marshal’s Office.\r\n\r\n    United States District Attorney’s Office.\r\n\r\n    Ship News, where incoming and outgoing vessels are reported.\r\n\r\n    Barge Office, where immigrants land.\r\n\r\n    Surrogate’s Office, where wills are filed and testimony\r\n    concerning wills in litigation is heard.\r\n\r\n    Political Headquarters during campaigns.”\r\n\r\nFinally, “the following are visited by the reporters several times, or\r\nonly once a day:\r\n\r\n    “Police Stations.\r\n\r\n    Municipal Courts.\r\n\r\n    Board of Health Headquarters.\r\n\r\n    Fire Department Headquarters.\r\n\r\n    Park Department Headquarters.\r\n\r\n    Building Department Headquarters.\r\n\r\n    Tombs Prison.\r\n\r\n    County Jail.\r\n\r\n    United States Sub-treasury.\r\n\r\n    Office of Collector of the Port.\r\n\r\n    United States Appraiser’s Office.\r\n\r\n    Public Hospitals.\r\n\r\n    Leading Hotels.\r\n\r\n    The Morgue.\r\n\r\n    County Sheriff’s Office.\r\n\r\n    City Comptroller’s Office.\r\n\r\n    City Treasurer’s Office.\r\n\r\n    Offices of the Tax Collector and Tax Assessors.”\r\n\r\nMr. Given’s example of the broker, John Smith, illustrates aptly the\r\npoint I am making. “For ten years,” said Mr. Given,[39] “he pursues\r\nthe even tenor of his way and except for his customers and his friends\r\nno one gives him a thought. To the newspapers he is as if he were not.\r\nBut in the eleventh year he suffers heavy losses and, at last, his\r\nresources all gone, summons his lawyer and arranges for the making of\r\nan assignment. The lawyer posts off to the County Clerk’s office, and\r\na clerk there makes the necessary entries in the office docket. Here\r\nin step the newspapers. While the clerk is writing Smith’s business\r\nobituary, a reporter glances over his shoulder, and a few minutes\r\nlater the newspapers know Smith’s troubles and are as well informed\r\nconcerning his business status as they would be had they kept a\r\nreporter at his door every day for over ten years. Had Smith dropped\r\ndead instead of merely making an assignment his name would have\r\nreached the newspapers by way of the Coroner’s office instead of the\r\nCounty Clerk’s office, and in fact, while Smith did not know it, the\r\nnewspapers were prepared and ready for him no matter what he did. They\r\neven had representatives waiting for him at the Morgue. He was safe\r\nonly when he walked the straight and narrow path and kept quiet.”\r\n\r\nAn overt act is often necessary before an event can be regarded as news.\r\n\r\nCommenting on this aspect of the situation, Mr. Lippmann discusses\r\nthis very example of the broker, John Smith, and his hypothetical\r\nbankruptcy. “That overt act,” says Mr. Lippmann,[40] “‘uncovers’ the\r\nnews about Smith. Whether the news will be followed up or not is\r\nanother matter. The point is that before a series of events become news\r\nthey have usually to make themselves noticeable in some more or less\r\novert act. Generally, too, in a crudely overt act. Smith’s friends may\r\nhave known for years that he was taking risks, rumors may even have\r\nreached the financial editor if Smith’s friends were talkative. But\r\napart from the fact that none of this could be published because it\r\nwould be libel, there is in these rumors nothing definite on which\r\nto peg a story. Something definite must occur that has unmistakable\r\nform. It may be the act of going into bankruptcy, it may be a fire,\r\na collision, an assault, a riot, an arrest, a denunciation, the\r\nintroduction of a bill, a speech, a vote, a meeting, the expressed\r\nopinion of a well-known citizen, an editorial in a newspaper, a sale, a\r\nwage-schedule, a price change, the proposal to build a bridge.... There\r\nmust be a manifestation. The course of events must assume a certain\r\ndefinable shape, and until it is in a phase where some aspect is an\r\naccomplished fact, news does not separate itself from the ocean of\r\npossible truth.”\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the practical journalist, Mr. Irwin has\r\napplied this observation to the making of the news of the day. He\r\nsays:[41] “I state a platitude when I say that government by the people\r\nis the essence of democracy. In theory, the people watch and know;\r\nwhen, in the process of social and industrial evolution, they see a\r\nnew evil becoming important, they found institutions to regulate it\r\nor laws to repress it. They cannot watch without light, know without\r\nteachers. The newspaper, or some force like it, must daily inform them\r\nof things which are shocking and unpleasant in order that democracy,\r\nin its slow, wobbling motion upward, may perceive and correct. It is\r\ngood for us to know that John Smith, made crazy by drink, came home and\r\nkilled his wife. Startled and shocked, but interested, we may follow\r\nthe case of John Smith, see that justice in his case is not delayed by\r\nhis pull with Tammany. Perhaps, when there are enough cases of John\r\nSmith, we shall look into the first causes and restrain the groggeries\r\nthat made him momentarily mad or the industrial oppression that made\r\nhim permanently an undernourished, overnerved defective. It is good to\r\nknow that John Jones, a clerk, forged a check and went to jail. For not\r\nonly shall we watch justice in his case, but some day we shall watch\r\nalso the fraudulent race-track gambling that tempted him to theft. If\r\nevery day we read of those crimes which grow from the misery of New\r\nYork’s East Side and Chicago’s Levee, some day democracy may get at the\r\nultimate causes for overwork, underfeeding, tenement crowding.\r\n\r\n“No other method is so forcible with the public as driving home the\r\ninstance which points the moral. General description of bad conditions\r\nfails, somehow, to impress the average mind. One might have shouted to\r\nShreveport day after day that low dives make dangerous negroes, and\r\ncreated no sentiment against saloons. But when a negro, drunk on bad\r\ngin which he got at such a dive, assaulted and killed Margaret Lear, a\r\nschoolgirl, Shreveport voted out the saloon.”\r\n\r\nFor the great mass of activities there is no machinery of record\r\nwhatever. How these are to be recorded when they are important is the\r\nreal problem for the press.\r\n\r\nIn this field the public relations counsel plays a considerable part.\r\nHis is the business of calling to the public attention, through the\r\npress and through every other available medium, the point of view, the\r\nmovement or the issue which he represents. Mr. Lippmann has observed\r\nthat it is for this reason that what he calls the “press agent” has\r\nbecome an important factor in modern life.\r\n\r\nMr. Lippmann’s observation on this point deserves comment. He says:[42]\r\n“This is the underlying reason for the existence of the press agent.\r\nThe enormous discretion as to what facts and what impressions shall be\r\nreported is steadily convincing every organized group of people that\r\nwhether it wishes to secure publicity or to avoid it, the exercise of\r\ndiscretion cannot be left to the reporter. It is safer to hire a press\r\nagent who stands between the group and the newspapers.”\r\n\r\nThe really important function of the public relations counsel, in\r\nrelation to the press as well as to his client, lies even beyond these\r\nconsiderations. He is not merely the purveyor of news; he is more\r\nlogically the _creator_ of news.\r\n\r\nAn amateur can bring a good story to the average newspaper office and\r\nreceive consideration, although the amateur is only too likely to miss\r\nprecisely those features of his story which give it news value, and\r\nto overlook precisely that element of the story which will make it\r\ninteresting to the particular newspaper he is approaching.\r\n\r\nThe New York hotel proprietors were enforcing the prohibition law in\r\nrelation to their own establishments, but saw that certain restaurants\r\nwere violating the law with impunity. Realizing the injustice to them\r\nof this situation, they built a definite news event by going over the\r\nheads of the local law enforcement offices and wired an appeal direct\r\nto President Harding, asking for enforcement. This naturally became\r\nnews of the first order.\r\n\r\nThe opening of a shop by prominent women in which were shown graphic\r\nexamples of the effect of the tariff on women’s wear was an event\r\ncreated to intensify interest in this subject.\r\n\r\nThe launching of battleships with ceremony; the laying of corner\r\nstones; the presentation of memorials; demonstration meetings, parties\r\nand banquets are all events created with a view to their carrying\r\ncapacity in the various mediums that reach the public.\r\n\r\nThe departments of a modern newspaper will show the great variety of\r\npossible approaches on any subject from the standpoint of the press.\r\nWhen this is correlated to the possible approaches on any subject\r\nfrom the standpoint of human psychology, we see the diversification\r\nof methods to which the public relations counsel can have recourse to\r\nconstruct events.\r\n\r\nIn the metropolitan press, for instance, there are the news\r\ndepartments, the editorial departments, the letter-to-the-editor\r\ndepartment, the women’s department, the society department, the current\r\nevents department, the sport department, the real estate department,\r\nthe business department, the financial department, the shipping\r\ndepartment, the investment department, the educational department,\r\nthe photographic department and the other special feature writers and\r\nsections, different in different journals.\r\n\r\nIn a valuable study on the “Newspaper Reading Habits of Business\r\nExecutives and Professional Men in New York” compiled by Professor\r\nGeorge Burton Hotchkiss, Head of the Department of Advertising and\r\nMarketing, and Richard B. Franken, Lecturer in Advertising at New York\r\nUniversity, there are several tables setting forth the features of\r\nmorning and evening newspapers preferred as a whole by the group to\r\nwhom the questionnaires were sent, and by various smaller groups within\r\nthe main group.\r\n\r\nThe counsel on public relations not only knows what news value is, but\r\nknowing it, he is in a position to _make news happen_. He is a creator\r\nof events.\r\n\r\nAn organization held a banquet for a building fund to which the\r\ninvitations were despatched on large bricks. The news element in this\r\nstory was the fact that bricks were despatched.\r\n\r\nIn this capacity, as purveyor and creator of news for the press as\r\nwell as for all other mediums of idea dissemination, it must be clear\r\nimmediately that the public relations counsel could not possibly\r\nsucceed unless he complied with the highest moral and technical\r\nrequirements of those with whom he is working.\r\n\r\nWriting on the profession of the public relations counsel, the author\r\nof an article in the _New York Times_[43] says “newspaper editors are\r\nthe most suspicious and cynical of mortals, but they are as quick to\r\ndiscern the truth as to detect the falsehood.” He goes on to discuss\r\nthe particular public relations counsel whom he has in mind and\r\nwhom he designates by the fictitious name Swift, and remarks that:\r\n“Irrespective of their position on ethics, Swift & Co. won’t deal\r\nin spurious goods. They know that one such error would be fatal. The\r\npublic might forget, but the editor never. Besides, they don’t have to.”\r\n\r\nTruthful and accurate must be the material which the public relations\r\ncounsel furnishes to the press and other mediums. In addition, it must\r\nhave the elements of timeliness and interest which are required of all\r\nnews--and it must not only have these elements in general, but it must\r\nsuit the particular needs of each particular newspaper and, even more\r\nthan that, it must suit the needs of the particular editor in whose\r\ndepartment it is hoped that it will be published.\r\n\r\nFinally, the literary quality of the material must be up to the best\r\nstandards of the profession of journalism. The writing must be good,\r\nin the particular sense in which each newspaper considers a story well\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nIn brief, the material must come to the editorial desk as carefully\r\nprepared and as accurately verified as if the editor himself had\r\nassigned a special reporter to secure and write the facts. Only by\r\npresenting his news in such form and in such a manner can the counsel\r\non public relations hope to retain, in the case of the newspaper, the\r\nmost valuable thing he possesses--the editor’s faith and trust. But it\r\nmust be clearly borne in mind that only in certain cases is the public\r\nrelations counsel the intermediary between the news and the press. The\r\nevent he has counseled upon, the action he has created finds its own\r\nlevel of expression in mediums which reach the public.\r\n\r\nThe radio stations offer an avenue of approach to the public. They are\r\ncontrolled by private organizations, large electrical supply companies,\r\ndepartment stores, newspapers, telegraph companies and in some cases by\r\nthe government. Their programs broadcast information and entertainment\r\nto those within their radius. These programs vary in different\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nTo the public relations counsel there is a wide opportunity to utilize\r\nthe means of distribution the radio program affords. In partisan\r\nmatters, the controllers of the radio insist upon the presentation of\r\nall points of view in order to have the onus of propaganda removed\r\nfrom their shoulders. The public relations counsel is therefore in a\r\nposition to suggest to the broadcasting managers a symposium treatment\r\nof the subject in which he happens to be interested. Or in the case of\r\ninformation, which has not this partisan character, he is in a position\r\nto assure treatment of his subject by embodying his thesis in the form\r\nof a speech delivered by some individual of standing and reputation.\r\n\r\nIn the case of events which the public relations counsel may be\r\ninstrumental in creating, such as large public meetings, the radio\r\nto-day becomes a natural form of distribution, just as news treatment\r\nin a newspaper does, and the broadcasting to thousands and thousands\r\nof people of the speeches becomes a corollary of the event itself. The\r\nbroadcasting of Lord Robert Cecil’s speech on the League of Nations,\r\ndelivered at a banquet in New York, is a case in point.\r\n\r\nMany magazines, for instance, are availing themselves of the radio\r\nstations to supply speeches on the particular topics they are most\r\ninterested in. So the housekeeping magazines supply the radio stations\r\nwith information about that phase of women’s activities. The fashion\r\nmagazines do likewise in their fields. And they thereby heighten their\r\nown prestige and authority in the minds of their hearers.\r\n\r\nThe use of the wireless telegraph in war time was an important factor\r\nin broadcasting information of war aims and war accomplishments\r\nto enemy countries. It was used successfully by both Allied and\r\nCentral powers. It was utilized even by the Soviet Government in the\r\nannouncement of its communications. This form of propagation differs\r\nslightly from the radio, referred to previously, since it depends for\r\nits efficacy not upon reaching great numbers of hearers, but upon\r\nreaching newspapers and other mediums that give currency to the\r\nmaterial broadcasted. The wireless telegraph of course was and is a\r\nvaluable asset to the public relations counsel.\r\n\r\nThe lecture platform is another well-established means of idea\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nThe spoken word has to a certain extent lost its efficacy when the\r\nlecture platform alone is considered.\r\n\r\nThe appeal of the lecture platform is limited by the actual number\r\nof those who hear the message. It is possible to reach vaster\r\nnumbers through the printed word or the motion picture or even the\r\nradioed word. Both the weakness of the human voice and the physical\r\ncharacteristics of the place of assemblage bring about this limitation.\r\n\r\nThe lecture platform, however, still retains its importance for the\r\npublic relations counsel because it affords him the opportunity to\r\nspeak before group audiences which in themselves have a news value, or\r\nbecause it presents the opportunity to stage dramatic events that bring\r\nintensification of interest and action on the part of larger audiences\r\nthan those actually addressed.\r\n\r\nThe lecture field open to the public relations counsel for the\r\npropagation of information or ideas may be divided into several\r\nclassifications. First there are the lecture managers and bureaus,\r\nwhich act as agents in booking lecturers to different kinds of group\r\naudiences throughout the country. The public relations counsel can,\r\nfor instance, suggest to his client to secure a prominent person, who\r\nbecause of interest in a cause will be glad to undertake a lecture\r\ntour. Then a bureau may manage the tour. The tours of important\r\nproponents on such issues as the League of Nations fall in this class\r\nas well as the tours of prominent authors, arranged by publishers in\r\ntheir behalf.\r\n\r\nThen there is the lecture tour managed by the client himself and\r\narranged through the booking of engagements with such local groups as\r\nmight be interested in assuming sponsorship for what is said. A soap\r\ncompany might engage a lecturer on cleanliness to speak in the schools\r\nof leading communities. Or a woolen firm arrange for a home economics\r\nauthority to lecture to women’s clubs on dress. These speeches of\r\ncourse, locally, gain a wider audience than the speaker would who\r\naddressed a single meeting because they give opportunity for treatment\r\nin newspapers, advertising, circularizing, and other mediums.\r\n\r\nThe lecture field offers another means of communication in as much\r\nas it gives the public relations counsel a range of group leaders to\r\nwhom he can furnish the facts and ideas he is trying to propagate. The\r\nlecturers of Boards of Education in cities throughout the country,\r\nthe lecturers before schools and other institutions of learning, the\r\nlecturers of one sort or another who address varied audiences can be\r\nreached directly and can become the carriers of the information the\r\npublic relations counsel desires to give forth.\r\n\r\nThe meeting or public demonstration, at which prominent speakers voice\r\ntheir views upon the particular problem or problems at issue, would\r\nfall quite naturally under this same classification. Its main purpose,\r\nof course, is not so much to reach the audience being addressed as to\r\nmake a focal point of interest for those thousands and millions who\r\ndo not attend, but who get the reverberations of the speaker’s voice\r\nthrough other mediums than their own auditory sensation.\r\n\r\nAdvertising is a medium open to the public relations counsel. In the\r\nsense in which the word is used here, the term applies to every form of\r\npaid space available for the carrying of a message. From the newspaper\r\nadvertisement to the billboard, its forms are so varied that it has\r\ndeveloped its own literature and its own principles and practice. In\r\nconsidering his objectives and the mediums through which his potential\r\npublic can be reached the public relations counsel always considers\r\nadvertising space as among his most important adjuncts. The wise public\r\nrelations counsel calls into conference on the particular kinds of\r\nadvertising to be used in a given problem the advertising agent who\r\nhas made this study his lifework. The public relations counsel and the\r\nadvertising agent then work out the problem in their respective fields.\r\n\r\nAdvertising up to the present time has laid its greatest stress upon\r\nthe creation of demands and markets for specific goods. It is also\r\napplied with effectiveness to the propagation of ideas as well. It is\r\npeculiarly effective when used in combination with other methods of\r\nappeal.\r\n\r\nAdvertising controls the amount of physical space it occupies before\r\nthe public eye. Advertising’s dimensional qualities give it a facile\r\nflexibility that can be extended or limited at will. In a sense, too,\r\nthis quality gives the special leader the opportunity to select his\r\naudience and to give them his message directly.\r\n\r\nThe field of coöperative advertising by combinations of advertisers in\r\nthe same business or profession, by governments or their subdivisions,\r\nfor one reason or another, is open to future possibilities.\r\n\r\nThe stage offers an avenue of approach to the public which must be\r\nregarded both from the standpoint of the numbers of individuals it\r\nreaches as well as from the circles of influence it creates by word\r\nof mouth and otherwise. To the public relations counsel therefore it\r\noffers a wide field.\r\n\r\nThrough coöperation with playwrights or managers, ideas can be given\r\ncurrency on the stage. When they can be translated to the action that\r\ntakes place upon a stage, they are given emphasis by the visual and\r\nauditory presentation.\r\n\r\nThe motion picture falls into two fields for the purposes of the public\r\nrelations counsel. There is the field of the feature film. Here any\r\ndirect utilization of the public relations counsel’s ideas must come\r\nindirectly and be taken by the producer of the film from some of the\r\nother organs of thought communication. The producer may adopt for the\r\nsubject of a film some idea which the public relations counsel has\r\nagitated. The film, for instance, dealing with the drug traffic came\r\nvery definitely as a result of the work carried on to help relieve the\r\ndrug evil.\r\n\r\nThe second field is one the public relations counsel can employ more\r\ndirectly. Educational films are made to order to-day to illustrate\r\nspecific points for public consumption, from showing how a product is\r\nmade to showing the necessity for subway relief in a big city. These\r\nfilms are usually shown before a special group audience arranged for\r\nby the public relations counsel or before some other group interested\r\nin the idea the particular film stands for. Thus a Chamber of\r\nCommerce can further a film having to do with the need for better port\r\nfacilities.\r\n\r\nOne phase of this kind of film is the news reel which, controlled by a\r\nprivate organization, films events and occasions which may have been\r\ncreated by the public relations counsel, but which carries because of\r\nits value in the competitive market of events.\r\n\r\nWord of mouth is an important medium to be considered. Ideas and facts\r\ncan be given currency by word of mouth. Here group leaders are strong\r\nfactors in giving currency to ideas. The public relations counsel often\r\ncommunicates the ideas he wishes to promulgate to group leaders whose\r\nespousal of the idea he wishes to obtain.\r\n\r\nThe direct-by-mail campaign and the printed word afford the public\r\nrelations counsel channels of approach to such individuals as he may\r\ndesire to reach. Large companies have available for such purposes lists\r\nof individuals arranged according to innumerable criteria. There are\r\ngeographical divisions, professional divisions, business divisions, and\r\ndivisions of religion. There are classifications by economic position,\r\nclassifications by all manner of preferences. This classification of\r\nhis public into the right groups for the proper appeals is one of\r\nthe most important functions of the public relations counsel, as we\r\nhave pointed out. The direct-by-mail method of approach offers wide\r\nopportunities for capitalizing his training and experience along these\r\nlines. Telegraphic and wireless communications would of course come\r\nunder this heading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHIS OBLIGATIONS TO THE PUBLIC AS A SPECIAL PLEADER\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been the history of new professions--and every profession\r\nhas been at some time a new profession--that they are accepted by\r\nthe public and become firmly established only after two significant\r\nhandicaps are overcome. The first of these, oddly enough, lies in\r\npublic opinion itself; it consists of the public’s reluctance to\r\nacknowledge a dependence, however slight, upon the ministrations of\r\nany one group of persons. Medicine, even to-day, is still fighting\r\nthis reluctance. The law is fighting it. Yet these are established\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\nThe second handicap is that any new profession must become established,\r\nnot through the efforts and activities of others, who might be\r\nconsidered impartial, but through its own energy.\r\n\r\nThese handicaps are particularly potent in a profession of advocacy,\r\nbecause it is engaged in the partisan representation of one point of\r\nview. The legal profession is perhaps the most familiar example of this\r\nfact, and in this light at least a trenchant comparison may be drawn\r\nbetween the bar and the new profession of the public relations counsel.\r\n\r\nBoth these professions offer to the public substantially the same\r\nservices--expert training, a highly sensitized understanding of the\r\nbackground from which results must be obtained, a keenly developed\r\ncapacity for the analysis of problems into their constituent elements.\r\nBoth professions are in constant danger of arousing crowd antagonism,\r\nbecause they often stand in frank and open opposition to the fixed\r\npoint of view of one or another of the many groups which compose\r\nsociety. Indeed it is this aspect of the work of the public relations\r\ncounsel which is undoubtedly the foundation of a good deal of popular\r\ndisapproval of his profession.\r\n\r\nEven Mr. Martin, who on several occasions in his volume talks with\r\nsevere condemnation of what he calls propaganda, sees and admits the\r\nfundamental psychological factors which make the adherents to one point\r\nof view impute degraded or immoral motives to believers in other points\r\nof view. He says:[44]\r\n\r\n“The crowd-man can, when his fiction is challenged, save himself from\r\nspiritual bankruptcy, preserve his defenses, keep his crowd from going\r\nto pieces, only by a demur. Any one who challenges the crowd’s fictions\r\nmust be ruled out of court. He must not be permitted to speak. As\r\na witness to contrary values, his testimony must be discounted. The\r\nworth of his evidence must be discredited by belittling the disturbing\r\nwitness. ‘He is a bad man; the crowd must not listen to him.’ His\r\nmotives must be evil; he is ‘bought up’; he is an immoral character; he\r\ntells lies; he is insincere or he ‘has not the courage to take a stand’\r\nor ‘there is nothing new in what he says.’\r\n\r\n“Ibsen’s ‘Enemy of the People,’ illustrates this point very well. The\r\ncrowd votes that Doctor Stockman may not speak about the baths, the\r\nreal point at issue. Indeed, the mayor takes the floor and officially\r\nannounces that the doctor’s statement that the water is bad is\r\n‘unreliable and exaggerated.’ Then the president of the Householders’\r\nAssociation makes an address accusing the doctor of secretly ‘aiming at\r\nrevolution.’ When finally Doctor Stockman speaks and tells his fellow\r\ncitizens the real meaning of their conduct, and utters a few plain\r\ntruths about ‘the compact majority,’ the crowd saves its face, not by\r\nproving the doctor false, but by howling him down, voting him an ‘enemy\r\nof the people,’ and throwing stones through the window.”\r\n\r\nIf we analyze a specific example of the public relations counsel’s\r\nwork, we see the workings of the crowd-mind, which have made it so\r\ndifficult for his profession to gain popular approval. Let us take,\r\nfor example, the tariff situation again. It is manifestly impossible\r\nfor either side in the dispute to obtain a totally unbiased point\r\nof view as to the other side. The importer calls the manufacturer\r\nunreasonable; he imputes selfish motives to him. For his own part he\r\nidentifies the establishment of the conditions upon which he insists\r\nwith such things as social welfare, national safety, Americanism, lower\r\nprices to the consumer, and whatever other fundamentals he can seize\r\nupon. Every newspaper report carrying the flavor of adverse suggestion,\r\nwhether on account of its facts or on account of the manner of its\r\nwriting, is immediately branded as untrue, unfortunate, ill-advised. It\r\nmust, the importer concludes, it must have been inspired by insidious\r\nmachinations from the manufacturers’ interests.\r\n\r\nBut is the manufacturer any more reasonable? If the newspapers\r\npublish stories unfavorable to his interests, then the newspapers\r\nhave been “bought up,” “influenced”; they are “partisan” and many\r\nother unreasonable things. The manufacturer, just like the importer,\r\nidentifies his side of the struggle with such fundamental standards\r\nas he can seize upon--a living wage, reduced prices to the consumer,\r\nthe American standard of employment, fair play, justice. To each the\r\ncontentions of the other are untenable.\r\n\r\nNow, carry this situation one step further to the point at which the\r\npublic relations counsel is retained, on behalf of one side or the\r\nother. Observe how sincerely each side and its adherents call even\r\nthe verifiable facts and figures of the other by that dread name\r\n“propaganda.” Should the importers submit figures showing that wages\r\ncould be raised and the price to the consumer reduced, their adherents\r\nwould be gratified that such important educational work should be done\r\namong the public and that the newspapers should be so fair-minded as\r\nto publish it. The manufacturers, on the other hand, will call such\r\nmaterial “propaganda” and blame either the newspaper which publishes\r\nthose figures or the economist who compiled them, or the public\r\nrelations counsel who advised collating the material.\r\n\r\nThe only difference between “propaganda” and “education,” really, is in\r\nthe point of view. The advocacy of what we believe in is education. The\r\nadvocacy of what we don’t believe in is propaganda. Each of these nouns\r\ncarries with it social and moral implications. Education is valuable,\r\ncommendable, enlightening, instructive. Propaganda is insidious,\r\ndishonest, underhand, misleading. It is only to-day that the viewpoint\r\non this question is undergoing a slight change, as the following\r\neditorial would indicate:\r\n\r\n“The relativity of truth,”[45] says Mr. Elmer Davis, “is a commonplace\r\nto any newspaper man, even to one who has never studied epistemology;\r\nand, if the phrase is permissible, truth is rather more relative in\r\nWashington than anywhere else. Now and then it is possible to make a\r\ndownright statement; such and such a bill has passed in one of the\r\nhouses of Congress, or failed to pass; the administration has issued\r\nthis or that statement; the President has approved, or vetoed, a\r\ncertain bill. But most of the news that comes out of Washington is\r\nnecessarily rather vague, for it depends on the assertions of statesmen\r\nwho are reluctant to be quoted by name, or even by description. This\r\nmore than anything else is responsible for the sort of fog, the haze\r\nof miasmatic exhalations, which hangs over news with a Washington date\r\nline. News coming out of Washington is apt to represent not what is so\r\nbut what might be so under certain contingencies, what may turn out to\r\nbe so, what some eminent personage says is so, or even what he wants\r\nthe public to believe is so when it is not.”\r\n\r\nMost subjects on which there is a so-called definite public opinion are\r\nmuch more vague and indefinite, much more complex in their facts and in\r\ntheir ramifications than the news from Washington which the historian\r\nof the _New York Times_ describes. Consider, for example, what\r\ncomplicated issues are casually disposed of by the average citizen.\r\nAn uninformed lay public may condemn a new medical theory on slight\r\nconsideration. Its judgment is hit or miss, as medical history proves.\r\n\r\nPolitical, economic and moral judgments, as we have seen, are more\r\noften expressions of crowd psychology and herd reaction than the result\r\nof the calm exercise of judgment. It is difficult to believe that this\r\nis not inevitable. Public opinion in a society consisting of millions\r\nof persons, all of whom must somehow or other reach a working basis\r\nwith most of the others, is bound to find a level of uniformity founded\r\non the intelligence of the average member of society as a whole or of\r\nthe particular group to which one may belong. There is a different\r\nset of facts on every subject for each man. Society cannot wait to\r\nfind absolute truth. It cannot weigh every issue carefully before\r\nmaking a judgment. The result is that the so-called truths by which\r\nsociety lives are born of compromise among conflicting desires and\r\nof interpretation by many minds. They are accepted and intolerantly\r\nmaintained once they have been determined. In the struggle among ideas,\r\nthe only test is the one which Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court\r\npointed out--the power of thought to get itself accepted in the open\r\ncompetition of the market.\r\n\r\nThe only way for new ideas to gain currency is through the acceptance\r\nof them by groups. Merely individual advocacy will leave the truth\r\noutside the general fund of knowledge and beliefs. The urge toward\r\nsuppression of minority or dissentient points of view is counteracted\r\nin part by the work of the public relations counsel.\r\n\r\nThe standards of the public relations counsel are his own standards and\r\nhe will not accept a client whose standards do not come up to them.\r\nWhile he is not called upon to judge the merits of his case any more\r\nthan a lawyer is called upon to judge his client’s case, nevertheless\r\nhe must judge the results which his work would accomplish from an\r\nethical point of view.\r\n\r\nIn law, the judge and jury hold the deciding balance of power. In\r\npublic opinion, the public relations counsel is judge and jury because\r\nthrough his pleading of a case the public is likely to accede to his\r\nopinion and judgment. Therefore, the public relations counsel must\r\nmaintain an intense scrutiny of his actions, avoiding the propagation\r\nof unsocial or otherwise harmful movements or ideas.\r\n\r\nEvery public relations counsel has been confronted with the necessity\r\nof refusing to accept clients whose cases in a law court would be\r\nvalid, but whose cases in the higher court of public opinion are\r\nquestionable.\r\n\r\nThe social value of the public relations counsel lies in the fact that\r\nhe brings to the public facts and ideas of social utility which would\r\nnot so readily gain acceptance otherwise. While he, of course, may\r\nrepresent men and individuals who have already gained great acceptance\r\nin the public mind, he may represent new ideas of value which have not\r\nyet reached their point of largest acceptance or greatest saturation.\r\nThat in itself renders him important.\r\n\r\nAs for the relations between the public relations counsel and his\r\nclient, little can be said which would not be merely a repetition of\r\nthat code of decency by which men and women make moral judgments and\r\nlive reputable lives. The public relations counsel owes his client\r\nconscientious, effective service, of course. He owes to his client\r\nall the duties which the professions assume in relation to those they\r\nserve. Much more important than any positive duty, however, which the\r\npublic relations counsel owes to his client is the negative duty--that\r\nhe must never accept a retainer or assume a position which puts his\r\nduty to the groups he represents above his duty to his own standards\r\nof integrity--to the larger society within which he lives and works.\r\n\r\nEurope has given us the most recent important study of public opinion\r\nand its social and historical effects. It is interesting because it\r\nindicates the sweep of the development of an international realization\r\nof what a momentous factor in the world’s life public opinion is\r\nbecoming. I feel that this paragraph from a recent work of Professor\r\nVon Ferdinand Tonnies is of particular significance to all who would\r\nfeel that the conscious moulding of public opinion is a task embodying\r\nhigh ideals.\r\n\r\n“The future of public opinion,” says Professor Tonnies, “is the future\r\nof civilization. It is certain that the power of public opinion is\r\nconstantly increasing and will keep on increasing. It is equally\r\ncertain that it is more and more being influenced, changed, stirred by\r\nimpulses from below. The danger which this development contains for a\r\nprogressive ennobling of human society and a progressive heightening\r\nof human culture is apparent. The duty of the higher strata of\r\nsociety--the cultivated, the learned, the expert, the intellectual--is\r\ntherefore clear. They must inject moral and spiritual motives into\r\npublic opinion. Public opinion must become public conscience.”\r\n\r\nIt is in the creation of a public conscience that the counsel on public\r\nrelations is destined, I believe, to fulfill his highest usefulness to\r\nthe society in which he lives.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Cardozo, “The Nature of the Judicial Process” (page 9).\r\n\r\n[2] Walter Lippmann, “Public Opinion” (page 248).\r\n\r\n[3] “Public Opinion” (page 342).
