What seem to me the most valuable things I learned in the\r\ncourse of that experience are herein submitted to my fellow-countrymen,\r\nin connection with a narrative covering the whole of the American\r\noccupation of the Philippines to date.\r\n\r\nThis book is an attempt, by one whose intimate acquaintance with two\r\nremotely separated peoples will be denied in no quarter, to interpret\r\neach to the other. How intelligent that acquaintance is, is of course\r\naltogether another matter, which the reader will determine for himself.\r\n\r\nThe task here undertaken is to make audible to a great free nation the\r\nvoice of a weaker subject people who passionately and rightly long to\r\nbe also free, but whose longings have been systematically denied for\r\nthe last fourteen years, sometimes ignorantly, sometimes viciously,\r\nand always cruelly, on the wholly erroneous idea that where the end is\r\nbenevolent, it justifies the means, regardless of the means necessary\r\nto the end.\r\n\r\nAt a time when all our military and fiscal experts agree that having\r\nthe Philippines on our hands is a grave strategic and economic mistake,\r\nfraught with peril to the nation's prestige in the early stages of our\r\nnext great war, we are keeping the Filipinos in industrial bondage\r\nthrough unrighteous Congressional legislation for which special\r\ninterests in America are responsible, in bald repudiation of the\r\nOpen Door policy, and against their helpless but universal protest,\r\na wholly unprotected and easy prey to the first first-class Power with\r\nwhich we become involved in war. Yet all the while the very highest\r\nconsiderations of national honor require us to choose between making\r\nthe Filipino people free and independent without unnecessary delay,\r\nas they of right ought to be, or else imperilling the perpetuity\r\nof our own institutions by the creation and maintenance of a great\r\nstanding army, sufficient properly to guard overseas possessions.\r\n\r\nA cheerful blindness to the inevitable worthy of Mark Tapley himself,\r\nthe stale Micawberism that \"something is bound to turn up,\" and\r\na Mrs. Jellyby philanthropy hopelessly callous to domestic duties,\r\nexpenses, and distresses, have hitherto successfully united to prevent\r\nthe one simple and supreme need of the situation--a frank, formal,\r\nand definite declaration, by the law-making power of the government,\r\nof the nation's purpose in the premises. What is needed is a formal\r\nlegislative announcement that the governing of a remote and alien\r\npeople is to have no permanent place in the purposes of our national\r\nlife, and that we do bona fide intend, just as soon as a stable\r\ngovernment, republican in form, can be established by the people\r\nof the Philippine Islands, to turn over, upon terms which shall be\r\nreasonable and just, the government and control of the islands to\r\nthe people thereof.\r\n\r\nThe essentials of the problem, being at least as immutable as human\r\nnature and geography, will not change much with time. And whenever\r\nthe American people are ready to abandon the strange gods whose\r\nguidance has necessitated a new definition of Liberty consistent with\r\ntaxation without representation and unanimous protest by the governed,\r\nthey will at once set about to secure to a people who have proven\r\nthemselves brave and self-sacrificing in war, and gentle, generous,\r\nand tractable in peace, the right to pursue happiness in their own way,\r\nin lieu of somebody else's way, as the spirit of our Constitution,\r\nand the teachings of our God, Who is also theirs, alike demand.\r\n\r\nAfter seven years spent at the storm-centre of so-called \"Expansion,\"\r\nthe first of the seven as a volunteer officer in Cuba during and after\r\nthe Spanish War, the next two in a like capacity in the Philippines,\r\nand the remainder as a United States judge in the last-named country,\r\nthe writer was finally invalided home in 1905, sustained in spirit,\r\nat parting, by cordial farewells, oral and written, personal and\r\nofficial, but convinced that foreign kindness will not cure the\r\ndesire of a people, once awakened, for what used to be known as\r\nFreedom before we freed Cuba and then subjugated the Philippines; and\r\nthat to permanently eradicate sedition from the Philippine Islands,\r\nthe American courts there must be given jurisdiction over thought\r\nas well as over overt act, and must learn the method of drawing an\r\nindictment against a whole people.\r\n\r\nSeven other years of interested observation from the Western Hemisphere\r\nend of the line have confirmed and fortified the convictions above\r\nset forth.\r\n\r\nIf we give the Filipinos this independence they so ardently desire\r\nand ever clamor for until made to shut up, \"the holy cause,\"\r\nas their brilliant young representative in the American House\r\nof Representatives, Mr. Quezon, always calls it, will not be at\r\nonce spoiled, as the American hemp and other special interests so\r\ncontemptuously insist, by the gentleman named, and his compatriot,\r\nSenor Osmena, the Speaker of the Philippine Assembly, and the rest of\r\nthe leaders of the patriot cause, in a general mutual throat-cutting\r\nincidental to a scramble for the offices. This sort of contention is\r\nmerely the hiss of the same old serpent of tyranny which has always\r\nbeset the pathway of man's struggle for free institutions.\r\n\r\nWhen first the talk in America, after the battle of Manila Bay,\r\nabout keeping the Philippines, reached the islands, one of the\r\nFilipino leaders wrote to another during the negotiations between\r\ntheir commanding general and our own looking to preservation of\r\nthe peace until the results of the Paris Peace Conference which\r\nsettled the fate of the islands should be known, in effect, thus:\r\n\"The Filipinos will not be fit for independence in ten, twenty, or a\r\nhundred years if it be left to American colonial office-holders drawing\r\ngood salaries to determine the question.\" Is there not some human\r\nnature in that remark? Suppose, reader, you were in the enjoyment\r\nof a salary of five, ten, or twenty thousand dollars a year as a\r\ngovernment official in the Philippines, how precipitately would you\r\nhasten to recommend yourself out of office, and evict yourself into\r\nthis cold Western world with which you had meantime lost all touch?\r\n\r\nThe Filipinos can run a far better government than the Cubans. In 1898,\r\nwhen Admiral Dewey read in the papers that we were going to give Cuba\r\nindependence, he wired home from Manila:\r\n\r\n\r\n    These people are far superior in their intelligence, and more\r\n    capable of self-government than the people of Cuba, and I am\r\n    familiar with both races.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter a year in Cuba and nearly six in the Philippines, two as an\r\nofficer of the army that subjugated the Filipinos, and the remainder\r\nas a judge over them, I cordially concur in the opinion of Admiral\r\nDewey, but with this addition, viz., that the people of those islands,\r\nwhatever of conscious political unity they may have lacked in 1898,\r\nwere welded into absolute oneness as a people by their original\r\nstruggle for independence against us, and will remain forever so\r\nwelded by their incurable aspirations for a national life of their\r\nown under a republic framed in imitation of ours. Furthermore, the one\r\ngreat difference between Cuba and the Philippines is that the latter\r\ncountry has no race cancer forever menacing its peace, and sapping\r\nits self-reliance. The Philippine people are absolutely one people,\r\nas to race, color, and previous condition. Again, American sugar and\r\ntobacco interests will never permit the competitive Philippine sugar\r\nand tobacco industries to grow as Nature and Nature's God intended;\r\nand the American importers of Manila hemp--which is to the Philippines\r\nwhat cotton is to the South--have, through special Congressional\r\nlegislation still standing on our statute books--to the shame of the\r\nnation--so depressed the hemp industry of the islands that the market\r\nprice it brings to-day is just one half what it brought ten years ago.\r\n\r\nIf three strong and able Americans, familiar with insular conditions\r\nand still young enough to undertake the task, were told by a President\r\nof the United States, by authority of Congress, \"Go out there and\r\nset up a stable native government by July 4, 1921, [1] and then come\r\naway,\" they could and would do it; and that government would be a\r\nsuccess; and one of the greatest moral victories in the annals of\r\nfree government would have been written by the gentlemen concerned\r\nupon the pages of their country's history.\r\n\r\nWe ought to give the Filipinos their independence, even if we have\r\nto guarantee it to them. But, by neutralization treaties with the\r\nother great Powers similar to those which safeguard the integrity and\r\nindependence of Switzerland to-day, whereby the other Powers would\r\nagree not to seize the islands after we give them their independence,\r\nthe Philippines can be made as permanently neutral territory in\r\nAsiatic politics as Switzerland is to-day in European politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nJames H.

C.,\r\nJuly 4, 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\nP.S.--The preparation of this book has entailed examination of a\r\nvast mass of official documents, as will appear from the foot-note\r\ncitations to the page and volume from which quotations have been\r\nmade. The object has been to place all material statements of fact\r\nbeyond question. For the purpose of this research work, Mr. Herbert\r\nPutnam, Librarian of Congress, was kind enough to extend me the\r\nprivileges of the national library, and it would be most ungracious\r\nto fail to acknowledge the obligation I am under, in this regard,\r\nto one whom the country is indeed fortunate in having at the head\r\nof that great institution. I should also make acknowledgment of the\r\nobligation I am under to Mr. W. W. Bishop, the able superintendent\r\nof the reading-room, for aid rendered whenever asked, and to my\r\nlife-long friends, John and Hugh Morrison, the most valuable men,\r\nto the general public, except the two gentlemen above named, on the\r\nwhole great roll of employees of the Library of Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ.

Mr. Pratt is later quietly separated from the\r\n    consular service.\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nDewey and Aguinaldo                                              16-45\r\n\r\n    After the battle of Manila Bay, May 1, 1898, Admiral Dewey brings\r\n    Aguinaldo down from Hong Kong, whither he had proceeded from\r\n    Singapore, lands him at Cavite, and chaperones his insurrection\r\n    against the Spaniards until the American troops arrive, June 30th.\r\n\r\nChapter III\r\n\r\nAnderson and Aguinaldo                                           46-66\r\n\r\n    General Anderson's official dealings with Aguinaldo from June 30,\r\n    1898, until General Merritt's arrival, July 25th,\r\n\r\nChapter IV\r\n\r\nMerritt and Aguinaldo                                            67-87\r\n\r\n    General Merritt's five weeks' sojourn in the Islands, from July 25,\r\n    1898, to the end of August, including fall of Manila, August 13th,\r\n    and our relations with Aguinaldo during period indicated.\r\n\r\nChapter V\r\n\r\nOtis and Aguinaldo                                              88-106\r\n\r\n    Dealings and relations between, September-December,\r\n1898.\r\n\r\nChapter VI\r\n\r\nThe Wilcox-Sargent Trip                                        107-120\r\n\r\n    Two American naval officers make an extended tour through\r\n    the interior of Luzon by permission of Admiral Dewey and with\r\n    Aguinaldo's consent, in October-November, 1898, while the Paris\r\n    peace negotiations were in progress. What they saw and learned.\r\n\r\nChapter VII\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Paris                                            121-138\r\n\r\n    An account of the negotiations, October-December, 1898. How we came\r\n    to pay Spain $20,000,000 for a $200,000,000 insurrection. Treaty\r\n    signed December 10, 1898.\r\n\r\nChapter VIII\r\n\r\nThe Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation                       139-151\r\n\r\n    President McKinley's celebrated proclamation of December 21,\r\n    1898, cabled out to the Islands, December 27, 1898, after the\r\n    signing of the Treaty of Paris on the 10th, and intended as\r\n    a fire-extinguisher, in fact acted merely as a firebrand, the\r\n    Filipinos perceiving that Benevolent Assimilation meant such\r\n    measure of slaughter as might be necessary to \"spare them from\r\n    the dangers of\" the independence on which they were bent.\r\n\r\nChapter IX\r\n\r\nThe Iloilo Fiasco                                              152-163\r\n\r\n    By order of President McKinley, General Otis abstains from\r\n    hostilities to await Senate action on Treaty of Paris.\r\n\r\nChapter X\r\n\r\nOtis and Aguinaldo (Continued)                          164-185\r\n\r\n    Still waiting for the Senate to act.\r\n\r\nChapter XI\r\n\r\nOtis and the War                                               186-223\r\n\r\n    Covering the period from the outbreak of February 4, 1899, until\r\n    the fall of that year.\r\n\r\nChapter XII\r\n\r\nOtis and the War (Continued)                            224-269\r\n\r\n    From the fall of 1899 to the spring of 1900.\r\n\r\nChapter XIII\r\n\r\nMacarthur and the War                                          270-281\r\n\r\n    Carries the story up to the date of the arrival of the Taft\r\n    Commission, sent out in the spring of 1900, to help General\r\n    MacArthur run the war.\r\n\r\nChapter XIV\r\n\r\nThe Taft Commission                                            282-344\r\n\r\n    Shows how the Taft Commission, born of the McKinley Benevolent\r\n    Assimilation theory that there was no real fundamental opposition\r\n    to American rule, lived up to that theory, in their telegrams\r\n    sent home during the presidential campaign of 1900, and in 1901\r\n    set up a civil government predicated upon their obstinate but\r\n    opportune delusions of the previous year.\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"The papers 'id it 'andsome\r\n            But you bet the army knows.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter XV\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft--1901-2                                          345-402\r\n\r\n    Shows the prematurity of a civil government set up under pressure\r\n    of political expediency, and the disorders which followed.\r\n\r\nChapter XVI\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft--1903                                            403-436\r\n\r\n    Shows divers serious insurrections in various provinces amounting\r\n    to what the Commission itself termed, in one instance, \"a reign of\r\n    terror\"--situations so endangering the public safety that to fail\r\n    to order out the army to quell the disturbances was neglect of\r\n    plain duty, such neglect being due to a set policy of preserving\r\n    the official fiction that peace prevailed, and that Benevolent\r\n    Assimilation was a success.\r\n\r\nChapter XVII\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft--1903 (Continued)                         437-445\r\n\r\n    Shows the essentially despotic, though theoretically benevolent,\r\n    character of the Taft civil government of the Philippines, and\r\n    its attitude toward the American business community in the Islands.\r\n\r\nChapter XVIII\r\n\r\nGovernor Wright--1904                                          446-498\r\n\r\n    Shows the change of the tone of the government under Governor\r\n    Taft's successor, his consequent popularity with his fellow-country\r\n    men in the Islands, and his corresponding unpopularity with the\r\n    Filipinos. Shows also a long series of massacres of pacificos by\r\n    enemies of the American government between July and November,\r\n    1904, permitted out of super-solicitude lest ordering out the\r\n    army and summarily putting a stop to said massacres might affect\r\n    the presidential election in the United States unfavorably to\r\n    Mr. Roosevelt, by reviving the notion that neither the Roosevelt\r\n    Administration nor its predecessor had ever been frank with the\r\n    country concerning the state of public order in the Islands.\r\n\r\nChapter XIX\r\n\r\nGovernor Wright--1905                                          499-514\r\n\r\n    Shows the prompt ordering of the army to the scene of the\r\n    disturbances after the presidential election of 1904 was safely\r\n    over, and the nature and extent of the insurrections of 1905.\r\n\r\nChapter XX\r\n\r\nGovernor Ide--1906                                             515-523\r\n\r\n    Describes the last outbreak prior to the final establishment of\r\n    a state of general and complete peace.\r\n\r\nChapter XXI\r\n\r\nGovernor Smith--1907-9                                         524-557\r\n\r\n    Describes divers matters, including a certificate made March 28,\r\n    1907, declaring that a state of general and complete peace had\r\n    prevailed for the two years immediately the preceding.

PRATT'S SERENADE\r\n\r\n                        Had I but served my God with half the zeal\r\n                        I served my king, he would not in mine age\r\n                        Have left me naked to mine enemies.\r\n\r\n                                      King Henry VIII., Act III., Sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny narrative covering our acquisition of the Philippine Islands\r\nmust, of course, centre in the outset about Admiral Dewey, and the\r\ndestruction by him of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay on Sunday\r\nmorning, May 1, 1898. But as the Admiral had brought Aguinaldo down\r\nfrom Hong Kong to Manila after the battle, and landed him on May\r\n19th to start an auxiliary insurrection, which insurrection kept the\r\nSpaniards bottled up in Manila on the land side for three and a half\r\nmonths while Dewey did the same by sea, until ten thousand American\r\ntroops arrived, and easily completed the reduction and capture of the\r\nbeleaguered and famished city on August 13th, it is necessary to a\r\nclear understanding of the de facto alliance between the Americans and\r\nAguinaldo thus created, to know who brought the Admiral and Aguinaldo\r\ntogether and how, and why.\r\n\r\nThe United States declared war against Spain, April 21, 1898,\r\nto free Cuba, and at once arranged an understanding with the Cuban\r\nrevolutionists looking to co-operation between their forces and ours\r\nto that end. For some years prior to this, political conditions in the\r\nPhilippines had been quite similar to those in Cuba, so that when, two\r\ndays after war broke out, the Honorable Spencer Pratt, Consul-General\r\nof the United States at Singapore, in the British Straits Settlements,\r\nfound Aguinaldo, who had headed the last organized outbreak against\r\nSpain in the Philippines, temporarily sojourning as a political\r\nrefugee at Singapore, in the Filipino colony there, he naturally\r\nsought to arrange for his co-operating with us against Spain, as\r\nGomez and Garcia were doing in Cuba. Thereby hangs the story of\r\n\"Mr. Pratt's Serenade.\" However, before we listen to the band whose\r\nstrains spoke the gratitude of the Filipinos to Mr. Pratt for having\r\nintroduced Aguinaldo to Dewey, let us learn somewhat of Aguinaldo's\r\nantecedents, as related to the purposes of the introduction.\r\n\r\nThe first low rumbling of official thunder premonitory to the war\r\nwith Spain was heard in Mr. McKinley's annual message to Congress of\r\nDecember, 1897, [2] wherein he said, among other things:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The most important problem with which this government is now\r\n    called upon to deal pertaining to its foreign relations concerns\r\n    its duty toward Spain and the Cuban insurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn that very month of December, 1897, Aguinaldo was heading a\r\nformidable insurrection against Spanish tyranny in the Philippines,\r\nand the Filipinos and their revolutionary committees everywhere were\r\nwatching with eager interest the course of \"The Great North American\r\nRepublic,\" as they were wont to term our government.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the First Philippine Commission sent out to the Islands\r\nby President McKinley in February, 1899, of which President Schurman\r\nof Cornell University was Chairman, contains a succinct memorandum\r\nconcerning the Filipino revolutionary movement of 1896-7, which had\r\nbeen begun by Aguinaldo in 1896, and had culminated in what is known as\r\nthe Treaty of Biac-na-Bato, [3] signed December 14, 1897. This treaty\r\nhad promised certain reforms, such as representation in the Spanish\r\nCortez, sending the Friars away, etc., and had also promised the\r\nleaders $400,000 if Aguinaldo and his Cabinet would leave the country\r\nand go to Hong Kong. \"No definite time was fixed,\" says President\r\nSchurman (vol. I., p. 171), \"during which these men were to remain\r\naway from the Philippines; and if the promises made by Spain were not\r\nfulfilled, they had the right to return.\" Of course, \"the promises made\r\nby Spain\" were not fulfilled. Spain thought she had bought Aguinaldo\r\nand his crowd off. \"Two hundred thousand dollars,\" says Prof. Schurman,\r\n\"was paid to Aguinaldo when he arrived in Hong Kong.\" But instead of\r\nusing this money in riotous living, the little group of exiles began\r\nto take notice of the struggles of their brothers in wretchedness\r\nin Cuba, and the ever-increasing probability of intervention by the\r\nUnited States in that unhappy Spanish colony, which, of course, would\r\nbe their opportunity to strike for Independence. They had only been\r\nin Hong Kong about two months when the Maine blew up February 15,\r\n1898, Then they knew there would be \"something doing.\" Hong Kong\r\nbeing the cross-roads of the Far East and the gateway to Asia, and\r\nbeing only sixty hours across the choppy China Sea from Manila, was\r\nthe best place in that part of the world to brew another insurrection\r\nagainst Spain. But Singapore is also a good place for a branch office\r\nfor such an enterprise, being on the main-travelled route between the\r\nPhilippines and Spain by way of the Suez Canal, about four or five days\r\nout of Hong Kong by a good liner, and but little farther from Manila,\r\nas the crow flies, than Hong Kong itself. Owing to political unrest\r\nin the Philippines in 1896-7-8, there was quite a colony of Filipino\r\npolitical refugees living at Singapore during that period. Aguinaldo\r\nhad gone over from Hong Kong to Singapore in the latter half of April,\r\n1898, arriving there, it so chanced, the day we declared war against\r\nSpain, April 21st. He was immediately sought out by Mr. Pratt, who\r\nhad learned of his presence in the community through an Englishman\r\nof Singapore, a former resident of Manila, a Mr. Bray, who seems to\r\nhave been a kind of striker for the Filipino general. Aguinaldo had\r\ncome incognito. Out of Mr. Pratt's interview with the insurgent chief\r\nthus obtained, and its results, grew the episode which is the subject\r\nof this chapter.\r\n\r\nA word just here, preliminary to this interview, concerning the\r\npersonal equation of Aguinaldo, would seem to be advisable.\r\n\r\nWhile I personally chased him and his outfit a good deal in the latter\r\npart of 1899, in the northern advance of a column of General Lawton's\r\nDivision from San Isidro across the Rio Grande de Pampanga, over the\r\nboggy passes of the Caraballa Mountains to the China Sea, and up the\r\nLuzon West Coast road, we never did catch him, and I never personally\r\nmet him but once, and that was after he was captured in 1901. He\r\nwas as insignificant looking physically as a Japanese diplomat. But\r\nhis presence suggested, equally with that of his wonderful racial\r\ncousins who represent the great empire of the Mikado abroad, both a\r\nhigh order of intelligence and baffling reserve. And Major-General\r\nJ. Franklin Bell, recently Chief of Staff, United States Army, who\r\nwas a Major on General Merritt's staff in 1898, having charge of the\r\n\"Office of Military Information,\" in a confidential report prepared\r\nfor his chief dated August 29, 1898, \"sizing up\" the various insurgent\r\nleaders, in view of the then apparent probability of trouble with them,\r\ngives these notes on Aguinaldo, the head and front of the revolution:\r\n\"Aguinaldo: Honest, sincere, and * * * a natural leader of men.\" [4]\r\n\r\nAny one acquainted with General Bell knows that he knows what he is\r\ntalking about when he speaks of \"a natural leader of men,\" for he is\r\none himself. Our ablest men in the early days were the first to cease\r\nconsidering the little brown soldiers a joke, and their government an\r\nopera-bouffe affair. General Bell also says in the same report that he,\r\nAguinaldo, is undoubtedly endowed in a wonderful degree with \"the power\r\nof creating among the people confidence in himself.\" He was, indeed,\r\nthe very incarnation of \"the legitimate aspirations of\" his people,\r\nto use one of the favorite phrases of his early state papers, and\r\nthe faithful interpreter thereof. That was the secret of his power,\r\nthat and a most remarkable talent for surrounding himself with an\r\natmosphere of impenetrable reserve. This last used to make our young\r\narmy officers suspect him of being what they called a \"four-flusher,\"\r\nwhich being interpreted means a man who is partially successful in\r\nmaking people think him far more important than he really is. But\r\nwe have seen General Bell's estimate. And the day Aguinaldo took the\r\noath of allegiance to the United States, in 1901, General MacArthur,\r\nthen commanding the American forces in the Philippines, signalized the\r\nevent by liberating 1000 Filipino prisoners of war. General Funston,\r\nthe man who captured him in 1901, says in Scribner's Magazine for\r\nNovember, 1911, \"He is a man of many excellent qualities and * * *\r\nfar and away the best Filipino I was ever brought in contact with.\"\r\n\r\nAguinaldo was born in 1869. To-day, 1912, he is farming about twenty\r\nmiles out of Manila in his native province of Cavite; has always\r\nscrupulously observed his oath of allegiance aforesaid; occasionally\r\ncomes to town and plays chess with Governor-General Forbes; and\r\nin all respects has played for the last ten years with really fine\r\ndignity the role of Chieftain of a Lost Cause on which his all had\r\nbeen staked. He was a school-teacher at Cavite at one time, but is not\r\na college graduate, and so far as mere book education is concerned, he\r\nis not a highly educated man. Whether or not he can give the principal\r\nparts of the principal irregular Greek verbs I do not know, but his\r\nplace in the history of his country, and in the annals of wars for\r\nindependence, cannot, and for the honor of human nature should not,\r\nbe a small one. Dr. Rizal, the Filipino patriot whose picture we print\r\non the Philippine postage stamps, and who was shot for sedition by the\r\nSpaniards before our time out there, was what Colonel Roosevelt would\r\njocularly call \"one of these darned literary fellows.\" He was a sort of\r\n\"Sweetness and Light\" proposition, who only wrote about \"The Rights of\r\nMan,\" and finally let the Spaniards shoot him--stuck his head in the\r\nlion's mouth, so to speak. Aguinaldo was a born leader of men, who knew\r\nhow to put the fear of God into the hearts of the ancient oppressors\r\nof his people. Mr. Pratt's own story of how he earned his serenade\r\nis preserved to future ages in the published records of the State\r\nDepartment. [5] We will now attempt to summarize, not so eloquently as\r\nMr. Pratt, but more briefly, the manner of its earning, the serenade\r\nitself, and its resultant effects both upon the personal fortunes of\r\nMr. Pratt and upon Filipino confidence in American official assurances.\r\n\r\nIt was on the evening of Saturday, April 23, 1898, that Mr. Pratt\r\nwas confidentially informed of Aguinaldo's arrival at Singapore,\r\nincognito. \"Being aware,\" says Mr. Pratt, \"of the great prestige of\r\nGeneral Aguinaldo with the insurgents, and that no one, either at\r\nhome or abroad, could exert over them the same influence and control\r\nthat he could, I determined at once to see him.\" Accordingly, he did\r\nsee him the following Sunday morning, the 24th.\r\n\r\nAt this interview, it was arranged that if Admiral Dewey, then\r\nat Hong Kong with his squadron awaiting orders, should so desire,\r\nAguinaldo should proceed to Hong Kong to arrange for co-operation\r\nof the insurgents at Manila with our naval forces in the prospective\r\noperations against the Spaniards.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, that Sunday, Mr. Pratt telegraphed Dewey through our\r\nconsul at Hong Kong:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aguinaldo, insurgent leader, here. Will come Hong Kong arrange\r\n    with Commodore for general co-operation insurgents Manila if\r\n    desired. Telegraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey (then Commodore) replied:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tell Aguinaldo come soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis message was received late Sunday night, April 24th, and was\r\nat once communicated to Aguinaldo. Mr. Pratt then did considerable\r\nbustling around for the benefit of his new-found ally, whom, with\r\nhis aide-de-camp and private secretary, all under assumed names\r\nhe \"succeeded in getting off,\" to use his phrase, by the British\r\nsteamer Malacca, which left Singapore for Hong Kong, April 26th. In\r\nthe letter reporting all this to the State Department, Mr. Pratt\r\nadds that he trusts this action \"in arranging for his [Aguinaldo's]\r\ndirect co-operation with the commander of our forces\" will meet\r\nwith the Government's approval. A little later Mr. Pratt sends the\r\nState Department a copy of the Singapore Free Press of May 4, 1898,\r\ncontaining an impressive account of the above transaction and the\r\nnegotiations leading up to it. This account describes the political\r\nconditions among the population of the Philippine archipelago, \"which,\"\r\nit goes on to say, \"merely awaits the signal from General Aguinaldo to\r\nrise en masse.\" Speaking of Pratt's interview with Aguinaldo, it says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    General Aguinaldo's policy embraces the independence of the\r\n    Philippines. * * * American protection would be desirable\r\n    temporarily, on the same lines as that which might be instituted\r\n    hereafter in Cuba.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Pratt also forwards a proclamation gotten up by the Filipino\r\ninsurgent leaders at Hong Kong and sent over to the Philippines in\r\nadvance of Admiral Dewey's coming, calling upon the Filipinos not\r\nto heed any appeals of the Spaniards to oppose the Americans, but to\r\nrally to the support of the latter. This manifesto of the Filipinos\r\nis headed, prominently--for all we know it may have had a heading\r\nas big as a Hearst newspaper box-car type announcement of the latest\r\nviolation of the Seventh Commandment--: \"America's Allies.\"\r\n\r\nIt begins thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Compatriots: Divine Providence is about to place independence\r\n    within our reach. * * * The Americans, not from mercenary motives,\r\n    but for the sake of humanity and the lamentations of so many\r\n    persecuted people, have considered it opportune * * * etc. [Here\r\n    follows a reference to Cuba.] At the present moment an American\r\n    squadron is preparing to sail for the Philippines. * * * The\r\n    Americans will attack by sea and prevent any reinforcements coming\r\n    from Spain; * * * we insurgents must attack by land. Probably\r\n    you will have more than sufficient arms, because the Americans\r\n    have arms and will find means to assist us. There where you\r\n    see the American flag flying, assemble in numbers; they are our\r\n    redeemers! [6]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor twelve days after his letter to the State Department enclosing\r\nthe above proclamation, Mr. Pratt, so far as the record discloses,\r\ncontemplated his coup d'etat in silent satisfaction. Since its\r\nsuccessful pulling off, Admiral Dewey had smashed the Spanish fleet,\r\nand Aguinaldo had started his auxiliary insurrection. The former was\r\npatting the latter on the back, as it were, and saying, \"Go it little\r\nman.\" But nobody was patting Pratt on the back, yet. Therefore, on June\r\n2d, Mr. Pratt writes the State Department, purring for patting thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Considering the enthusiastic manner General Aguinaldo has been\r\n    received by the natives and the confidence with which he already\r\n    appears to have inspired Admiral Dewey, it will be admitted,\r\n    I think, that I did not over-rate his importance and that I\r\n    have materially assisted the cause of the United States in the\r\n    Philippines in securing his co-operation. [7]\r\n\r\n\r\nA glow of conscious superiority, in value to the Government, over\r\nhis consular colleague and neighbor, Mr. Wildman, at Hong Kong,\r\nnext suffuses Mr. Pratt's diction, being manifested thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Why this co-operation should not have been secured to us during\r\n    the months General Aguinaldo remained awaiting events in Hong\r\n    Kong, and that he was allowed to leave there without having been\r\n    approached in the interest of our Government, I cannot understand.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering that in his letter accepting the nomination for the\r\nVice-Presidency two years after this Mr. Roosevelt compared Aguinaldo\r\nand his people to that squalid old Apache medicine man, Sitting Bull,\r\nand his band of dirty paint-streaked cut-throats, Mr. Pratt's next\r\nPickwickian sigh of complacent, if neglected, worth is particularly\r\ninteresting:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No close observer of what had transpired in the Philippines during\r\n    the past four years could have failed to recognize that General\r\n    Aguinaldo enjoyed above all others the confidence of the Filipino\r\n    insurgents and the respect alike of Spaniards and foreigners in\r\n    the islands, all of whom vouched for his high sense of justice\r\n    and honor.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, knowing the proverbial ingratitude of republics,\r\nMr. Pratt is determined to impress upon his Government and on the\r\ndiscerning historian of the future that he was \"the original Aguinaldo\r\nman.\" A week later (June 9th) Mr. Pratt writes the Department enclosing\r\ncopies of the Singapore papers of that date, giving an account of\r\na generous outburst of Filipino enthusiasm at Singapore in honor\r\nof America, Admiral Dewey, and, last, if not least, Mr. Pratt. He\r\nencloses duplicate copies of these newspaper notices \"for the press,\r\nshould you consider their publication desirable.\" His letter begins:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have the honor to report that this afternoon, on the occasion of\r\n    the receipt of the news of General Aguinaldo's recent successes\r\n    near Manila, I was waited upon by the Philippine residents in\r\n    Singapore and presented an address. * * *\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then proceeds with further details of the event, without\r\nself-laudation. The Singapore papers which he encloses, however, not\r\nhandicapped by the inexorable modesty of official correspondence,\r\ngive a glowing account of the presentation of the \"address,\" and\r\nof the serenade and toasts which followed. Says one of them, the\r\nStraits Times:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The United States consulate at Singapore was yesterday afternoon\r\n    in an unusual state of bustle. That bustle extended itself to\r\n    Raffles Hotel, of which the consulate forms an outlying part. From\r\n    a period shortly prior to 5 o'clock, afternoon, the natives of\r\n    the Philippines resident in Singapore began to assemble at the\r\n    consulate. Their object was to present an address to Hon. Spencer\r\n    Pratt, United States Consul-General, and, partly, to serenade him,\r\n    for which purpose some twenty-five or thirty of the Filipinos\r\n    came equipped with musical instruments.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst there was music by the band. Then followed the formal reading and\r\npresentation of the address by a Dr. Santos, representing the Filipino\r\ncommunity of Singapore. The address pledged the \"eternal gratitude\"\r\nof the Filipino people to Admiral Dewey and the honored addressee,\r\nalluded to the glories of independence, and to how Aguinaldo had been\r\nenabled by the arrangement so happily effected with Admiral Dewey\r\nby Consul Pratt to arouse 8,000,000 of Filipinos to take up arms\r\n\"in defence of those principles of justice and liberty of which your\r\ncountry is the foremost champion\" and trusted \"that the United States\r\n* * * will efficaciously second the programme arranged between you,\r\nsir, and General Aguinaldo in this port of Singapore, and secure to\r\nus our independence under the protection of the United States.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Pratt arose and \"proceeded speaking in French,\" says the\r\nnewspaper--it does not say Alabama French, but that is doubtless what\r\nit was--\"to state his belief that the Filipinos would prove and were\r\nnow proving themselves fit for self-government.\" The gentleman from\r\nAlabama then went on to review the mighty events and developments of\r\nthe preceding six weeks, Dewey's victory of May 1st,\r\n\r\n\r\n    the brilliant achievements of your own distinguished leader,\r\n    General Emilio Aguinaldo, co-operating on land with the Americans\r\n    at sea, etc. You have just reason to be proud of what has\r\n    been and is being accomplished by General Aguinaldo and your\r\n    fellow-countrymen under his command. When, six weeks ago, I\r\n    learned that General Aguinaldo had arrived incognito in Singapore,\r\n    I immediately sought him out. An hour's interview convinced me\r\n    that he was the man for the occasion; and, having communicated\r\n    with Admiral Dewey, I accordingly arranged for him to join the\r\n    latter, which he did at Cavite. The rest you know.\r\n\r\n\r\nSays the newspaper clipping which has preserved the Pratt oration:\r\n\"At the conclusion of Mr. Pratt's speech refreshments were served,\r\nand as the Filipinos, being Christians, drink alcohol, [8] there was\r\nno difficulty in arranging as to refreshments.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed a general drinking of toasts to America, Dewey, Pratt,\r\nand Aguinaldo. Then the band played. Then the meeting broke up. Then\r\nthe Honorable Spencer Pratt, Consul-General of the United States,\r\nretired to the seclusion of his apartments in Raffles Hotel, and,\r\nunder the soothing swish of his plunkah, forgot the accursed heat of\r\nthat stepping-off place, Singapore, and dreamed of future greatness.\r\n\r\nA few days later the even tenor of Mr. Pratt's meditations was\r\ndisturbed by a letter from the State Department saying, in effect,\r\nthat it was all right to get Aguinaldo's assistance \"if in so doing\r\nhe was not induced to form hopes which it might not be practicable to\r\ngratify.\" [9] But it did not tell him to tell the Filipinos so. For\r\nAguinaldo was keeping the Spaniards bottled up in the old walled city\r\nof Manila on short and ever shortening rations, and American troops\r\nwere on the way to join him, and the shorter the food supply grew\r\nin Manila the readier the garrison would be to surrender when they\r\ndid arrive, and the fewer American soldiers' lives would have to be\r\nsacrificed in the final capture of the town. Every day of Aguinaldo's\r\nservice under the Dewey-Pratt arrangement was worth an American life,\r\nperhaps many. It was too valuable to repudiate, just yet. July 20th,\r\nthe State Department wrote Mr. Pratt a letter acknowledging receipt of\r\nhis of June 9th \"enclosing printed copies of a report from the Straits\r\nTimes of the same day, entitled 'Mr. Spencer Pratt's Serenade,'\r\nwith a view to its communication to the press,\" and not only not\r\nfelicitating him on his serenade, but making him sorry he had ever\r\nhad a serenade. It said, among other things:\r\n\r\n\"The extract now communicated by you from the Straits Times of the\r\n9th of June has occasioned a feeling of disquietude and a doubt as\r\nto whether some of your acts may not have borne a significance and\r\nproduced an impression which this government would feel compelled\r\nto regret.\" [10] Hapless Pratt! \"Feel compelled to regret\" is State\r\nDepartment for \"You are liable to be fired.\"\r\n\r\nThe letter of reprimand proceeds:\r\n\r\n\"The address * * * discloses an understanding on their part that * * *\r\nthe ultimate object of our action is * * * the independence of the\r\nPhilippines * * *. Your address does not repel this implication * * *\".\r\n\r\nThe letter then scores Pratt for having called Aguinaldo \"the man\r\nfor the occasion,\" and for having said that the \"arrangement\" between\r\nAguinaldo and Dewey had \"resulted so happily,\" and after a few further\r\nanimadversions, concludes with this great blow to the reading public\r\nof Alabama:\r\n\r\n\"For these reasons the Department has not caused the article to be\r\ngiven to the press lest it might seem thereby to lend a sanction to\r\nviews the expression of which it had not authorized.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Department\" was very scrupulous about even the appearance, at\r\nthe American end of the line, of \"lending a sanction\" to Pratt's\r\narrangement with Aguinaldo, while all the time it was knowingly\r\npermitting the latter to daily risk his own life and the lives of\r\nhis countrymen on the faith of that very \"arrangement,\" and it was\r\nso permitting this to be done because the \"arrangement\" was daily\r\noperating to reduce the number of American lives which it would be\r\nnecessary to sacrifice in the final taking of Manila. The day the\r\nletter of reprimand was written our troop-ships were on the ocean,\r\nspeeding toward the Philippines. And Aguinaldo and his people were\r\nfighting the Spaniards with the pent-up feeling of centuries impelling\r\ntheir little steel-jacketed messengers of death, thinking of \"Cuba\r\nLibre,\" and dreaming of a Star of Philippine Independence risen in\r\nthe Far East.\r\n\r\nSuch are the circumstances from which the Filipino people derived\r\ntheir first impressions concerning the faith and honor of a strange\r\npeople they had never theretofore seen, who succeeded the Spaniards\r\nas their overlords. Mr. Pratt was subsequently quietly separated from\r\nthe consular service, and doubtless lived to regret that he had ever\r\nunloosed the fountains of his Alabama French on the Filipino colony\r\nof Singapore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nDEWEY AND AGUINALDO\r\n\r\n                    Armaments that thunderstrike the walls\r\n                    Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake\r\n                    And monarchs tremble in their capitals.\r\n\r\n                                                          Childe Harold.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe battle of Manila Bay was fought May 1, 1898. Until the thunder of\r\nDewey's guns reverberated around the world, there was perhaps no part\r\nof it the American people knew less about than the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nWe have all heard much of what happened after the battle, but\r\ncomparatively few, probably, have ever had a glimpse at our great\r\nsailor while he was there in Hong Kong harbor, getting ready to go\r\nto sea to destroy the Spanish armada. Such a glimpse is modestly\r\nafforded by the Admiral in his testimony before the Senate Committee\r\nin 1902. [11]\r\n\r\nAsked by the Committee when he first heard from Aguinaldo and his\r\npeople in 1898, Admiral Dewey said [12]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I should think about a month before leaving Hong Kong, that is,\r\n    about the first of April, when it became pretty certain that there\r\n    was to be war with Spain, I heard that there were a number of\r\n    Filipinos in the city of Hong Kong who were anxious to accompany\r\n    the squadron to Manila in case we went over. I saw these men two\r\n    or three times myself. They seemed to be all very young earnest\r\n    boys. I did not attach much importance to what they said or to\r\n    themselves. Finally, before we left Hong Kong for Mirs Bay [13]\r\n    I received a telegram from Consul-General Pratt at Singapore\r\n    saying that Aguinaldo was there and anxious to see me. I said to\r\n    him \"All right; tell him to come on,\" but I attached so little\r\n    importance to Aguinaldo that I did not wait for him. He did not\r\n    arrive, and we sailed from Mirs Bay without any Filipinos.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom his testimony before the Committee it is clear that Admiral\r\nDewey's first impressions of the Filipinos, like those of most\r\nAmericans after him, were not very favorable, that is to say, he did\r\nnot in the outset take them very seriously. It will be interesting\r\nto consider these impressions, and then to compare them with those he\r\ngathered on better acquaintance from observing their early struggles\r\nfor independence. The more intimate acquaintance, as has been the case\r\nwith all his fellow countrymen since, caused him to revise his first\r\nverdict. Answering a question put by Senator Carmack concerning what\r\ntranspired between him and the Philippine Revolutionists at Hong Kong\r\nbefore he sailed in search of the Spanish fleet, the Admiral said [14]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They were bothering me. I was getting my squadron ready for battle,\r\n    and these little men were coming on board my ship at Hong Kong and\r\n    taking a good deal of my time, and I did not attach the slightest\r\n    importance to anything they could do, and they did nothing; that\r\n    is, none of them went with me when I went to Mirs Bay. There had\r\n    been a good deal of talk, but when the time came they did not\r\n    go. One of them didn't go because he didn't have any tooth-brush.\r\n\r\n    Senator Burrows: \"Did he give that as his reason?\"\r\n\r\n    Admiral Dewey: \"Yes, he said 'I have no tooth-brush.'\"\r\n\r\n    They used to come aboard my ship and take my time, and finally\r\n    I would not see them at all, but turned them over to my staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the lack of a tooth-brush is hardly a valid excuse for not going\r\ninto battle, however great a convenience it may be in campaign. But\r\nthe absence of orders from your commanding officer stands on a very\r\ndifferent footing. Aguinaldo had not yet arrived. Three hundred years\r\nof Spanish misgovernment and cruelty is not conducive to aversion\r\nto fictitious excuses by the lowly in the presence of supreme\r\nauthority. The answer was amusingly uncandid, but disproved neither\r\npatriotism nor intelligence.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo arrived at Hong Kong from Singapore a day or so after\r\nAdmiral Dewey had sailed for Manila. Of the battle of May 1st,\r\nno detailed mention is essential here. Every schoolboy is familiar\r\nwith it. It will remain, as long as the republic lasts, a part of\r\nthe heritage of the nation. But the true glory of that battle, to my\r\nmind, rests, not upon the circumstance that we have the Philippines,\r\nbut upon the tremendous fact that before it occurred the attitude of\r\nour State Department toward an American citizen sojourning in distant\r\nlands and becoming involved in difficulties there had long been,\r\n\"Why didn't he stay at home? Let him stew in his own juice\"; whereas,\r\nsince then, to be an American has been more like it was in the days\r\nof St. Paul to be a Roman citizen.\r\n\r\nMay 16th, our consul at Hong Kong, Mr. Wildman, succeeded in\r\ngetting the insurgent leader and his staff off for Manila on board\r\nthe U. S. S. McCulloch by authority of Admiral Dewey. Like his\r\ncolleague over at Singapore, Consul Wildman was bent on the role of\r\nWarwick. Admiral Dewey was quite busy there in Manila Bay the first\r\ntwo or three weeks after the battle, but yielding to the letters\r\nof Wildman, who meantime had constituted himself a kind of fiscal\r\nagent at Hong Kong for the prospective revolution in the matter of\r\nthe purchase of guns and otherwise, the Admiral told the commanding\r\nofficer of the McCulloch that on his next trip to Hong Kong he might\r\nbring down a dozen or so of the Filipinos there. The frame of mind\r\nthey were in on reaching Manila, as a result of the assurances of\r\nPratt and Wildman, is well illustrated by a letter the latter wrote\r\nAguinaldo a little later (June 25th) which is undoubtedly in keeping\r\nwith what he had been telling him earlier:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Do not forget that the United States undertook this war for the\r\n    sole purpose of relieving the Cubans from the cruelties under\r\n    which they were suffering, and not for the love of conquest or\r\n    the hope of gain. They are actuated by precisely the same feelings\r\n    for the Filipinos. [15]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd at the time, they were.\r\n\r\n\"Every American citizen who came in contact with the Filipinos at\r\nthe inception of the Spanish War, or at any time within a few months\r\nafter hostilities began,\" said General Anderson in an interview\r\npublished in the Chicago Record of February 24, 1900, \"probably\r\ntold those he talked with * * * that we intended to free them from\r\nSpanish oppression. The general expression, was 'We intend to whip\r\nthe Spaniards and set you free.'\"\r\n\r\nThe McCulloch arrived in Manila Bay with Aguinaldo and his outfit,\r\nMay 19th. Let Admiral Dewey tell what happened then [16]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aguinaldo came to see me. I said, \"Well now, go ashore there; we\r\n    have got our forces at the arsenal at Cavite, go ashore and start\r\n    your army.\" He came back in the course of a few hours and said,\r\n    \"I want to leave here; I want to go to Japan.\" I said, \"Don't give\r\n    it up, Don Emilio.\" I wanted his help, you know. He did not sleep\r\n    ashore that night; he slept on board the ship. The next morning\r\n    he went on shore, still inside my lines, and began recruiting men.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnterprises of great pith and moment have often turned awry and lost\r\nthe name of action for lack of a word spoken in season by a stout\r\nheart. Admiral Dewey spoke the word, and Aguinaldo, his protege,\r\ndid the rest. \"Then he began operations toward Manila, and he did\r\nwonderfully well. He whipped the Spaniards battle after battle * * *.\"\r\n[17] In fact, the desperate bravery of those little brown men\r\nafter they got warmed up reminds one of the Japs at the walls of\r\nPeking, in the advance of the Allied Armies to the relief of the\r\nforeign legations during the Boxer troubles of 1900. Admiral Dewey\r\ntold the Senate Committee in 1902 that Aguinaldo actually wanted to\r\nput one of the old smooth-bore Spanish guns he found at Cavite on a\r\nbarge and have him (Dewey) tow it up in front of Manila so he could\r\nattack the city with it. \"I said, 'Oh no, no; we can do nothing until\r\nour troops come.'\"\r\n\r\nOtherwise he was constantly advising and encouraging him. Why? Let the\r\nAdmiral answer: \"I knew that what he was doing--driving the Spaniards\r\nin--was saving our troops.\" [17] In other words they were daily dying\r\nthat American soldiers might live, on the faith of the reasons for\r\nwhich we had declared war, and trusting, because of the words of our\r\nconsuls and the acts of our admiral, in the sentiment subsequently\r\nso nobly expressed by Mr. McKinley in his instructions to the Paris\r\npeace Commissioners:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The United States in making peace should follow the same high\r\n    rule of conduct which guided it in facing war. [18]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I did not know what the action of our Government would be,\" said\r\nthe Admiral to the Committee, [19] adding that he simply used his\r\nbest judgment on the spot at the time; presumably supposing that his\r\nGovernment would do the decent thing by these people who considered\r\nus their liberators. \"They looked on us as their liberators,\" said\r\nhe. [20] \"Up to the time the army came he (Aguinaldo) did everything I\r\nrequested. He was most obedient; whatever I told him to do he did. I\r\nsaw him almost daily. [21] I had not much to do with him after the\r\narmy came.\" [22]\r\n\r\nThat was no ordinary occasion, that midsummer session of the\r\nSenate Committee in 1902. It was a case of the powerful of the earth\r\ndiscussing a question of ethics, even as they do in Boston. The nation\r\nhad been intoxicated in 1898 with the pride of power--power revealed\r\nto it by the Spanish War; and in a spirit thus mellowed had taken\r\nthe Philippines as a sort of political foreign mission, forgetting\r\nthe injunction of the Fathers to keep Church and State separate,\r\nbut not forgetting the possible profits of trade with the saved. A\r\nlong war with the prospective saved had followed, developing many\r\nbarbarities avenged in kind, and the breezes from the South Seas were\r\nsuggesting the aroma of shambles. \"How did we get into all this mess,\r\nanyhow?\" said the people. \"Let us pause, and consider.\" Hear the\r\nstill small voice of a nation's conscience mingling with demagogic\r\nnonsense perpetrated by potent, grave, and reverend Senators:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Admiral Dewey: \"I do not think it makes any difference what my\r\n    opinion is on these things.\"\r\n\r\n    Senator Patterson: \"There is no man whose opinion goes farther\r\n    with the country than yours does, Admiral, and therefore I think\r\n    you ought to be very prudent in expressing your views.\"\r\n\r\n    Senator Beveridge (Acting Chairman): \"The Chairman will not permit\r\n    any member to lecture Admiral Dewey on his prudence or imprudence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis of course would read well to \"Mary of the Vine-clad Cottage\"\r\nout in Indiana, whose four-year-old boy was named George Dewey--,\r\nor to her counterpart up in Vermont who might name her next boy\r\nafter the brilliant and distinguished Acting Chairman, in token of\r\nher choice for the Presidency.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Senator Patterson: \"I was not lecturing him.\"\r\n\r\n    Senator Beveridge: \"Yes; you said he ought to be prudent.\"\r\n\r\n    Senator Patterson: \"And I think it was well enough to suggest\r\n    those things.\" [23]\r\n\r\n\r\nThawed into theorizing by these indubitably genuine evidences of\r\na nation's high regard, the man of action tried to help the nation\r\nout. He said he had used the Filipinos as the Federal troops used the\r\nnegroes in the Civil War. Senator Patterson struck this suggestion\r\namidships and sunk it with the remark that the negroes were expecting\r\nfreedom. Admiral Dewey had said \"The Filipinos were slaves too\"\r\nand considered him their liberator. [24] But he never did elaborate\r\non the new definition of freedom which had followed in the wake of\r\nhis ships to Manila, viz., that Freedom does not necessarily mean\r\nfreedom from alien domination, but only a change of masters deemed\r\nby the new master beneficial to the \"slave.\"\r\n\r\nApropos of why he accepted Aguinaldo's help, the Admiral also said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I was waiting for troops to arrive, and I felt sure the Filipinos\r\n    could not take Manila, and I thought that the closer they invested\r\n    the city the easier it would be when our troops arrived to march\r\n    in. The Filipinos were our friends, assisting us; they were doing\r\n    our work. [25]\r\n\r\n\r\nAsked as to how big a force Aguinaldo had under arms then and\r\nafterwards, the Admiral said maybe 25,000, adding, by way of\r\nillustration of the pluck, vim, and patriotism of his valuable new-made\r\nfriends, \"They could have had any number of men; it was just a question\r\nof arming them. They could have had the whole population.\" [26]\r\nEleven months after that, when we captured the first insurgent capital,\r\nMalolos, General MacArthur, the ablest and one of the bravest generals\r\nwe ever set to slaughtering Filipinos, said to a newspaper man just\r\nafter a bloody and of course victorious fight: \"When I first started in\r\nagainst these rebels, I believed that Aguinaldo's troops represented\r\nonly a faction.\" \"I did not like,\" said this veteran of three\r\nwars, who was always \"on the job\" in action out there as elsewhere,\r\n\"I did not like to believe that the whole population of Luzon * * *\r\nwas opposed to us * * * but after having come thus far, and having\r\nbeen brought much in contact with both insurrectos and amigos, I have\r\nbeen reluctantly compelled to believe that the Filipino masses are\r\nloyal to Aguinaldo and the government which he heads\". [27]\r\n\r\nIs it at all unlikely that Admiral Dewey did in fact say of his\r\nproteges, the Filipinos, to an American visiting Manila in January,\r\n1899, three or four weeks before the war broke out, \"Rather than\r\nmake a war of conquest upon the Filipino people, I would up anchor\r\nand sail out of the harbor.\" [28]\r\n\r\nIf Dewey and MacArthur were right, then, about the situation around\r\nManila in 1898, it was a case of an entire people united in an\r\naspiration, and looking to us for its fulfilment.\r\n\r\nWhen the American troops reached the Philippines and perfected\r\ntheir battle formations about Manila, and the order to advance\r\nwas given, they did \"march in,\" to use Admiral Dewey's expression\r\nabove quoted. But they did not let the Filipinos have a finger in the\r\npie. The conquest and retention of the islands had then been determined\r\nupon. The Admiral's reasons for saddling his protege with a series of\r\nbloody battles and a long and arduous campaign are certainly stated\r\nwith the proverbial frankness of the sailorman: \"I wanted his help,\r\nyou know.\" But what was Aguinaldo to get out of the transaction,\r\nfrom the Dewey point of view?\r\n\r\n\"They wanted to get rid of the Spaniards. I do not think they looked\r\nmuch beyond that,\" [29] said the Admiral to the Senate Committee. Let\r\nus see whether they did or not. Aguinaldo had been shipped by the\r\nHonorable E. Spencer Pratt, Consul-General of the United States at\r\nSingapore, from that point to Hong Kong on April 26th, consigned to\r\nhis fellow Warwick, the Honorable Rounseville Wildman, Consul-General\r\nof the United States at the last-named place, and had been received\r\nin due course by the consignee. May 5th, at Hong Kong, the Filipino\r\nRevolutionary Committee had a meeting, the minutes of which we\r\nsubsequently came into possession of, along with other captured\r\ninsurgent papers. The following is an extract from those minutes:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Once the President [Aguinaldo] is in the Philippines with his\r\n    prestige, he will be able to arouse the masses to combat the\r\n    demands of the United States, if they should colonize that country,\r\n    and will drive them, the Filipinos, if circumstances render it\r\n    necessary, to a Titanic struggle for their independence, even\r\n    if later they should succumb to the weight of the yoke of a new\r\n    oppressor. If Washington proposes to carry out the fundamental\r\n    principles of its Constitution, it is most improbable that an\r\n    attempt will be made to colonize the Philippines or annex them. It\r\n    is probable then that independence will be guaranteed. [30]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe truth is that instead of leaving everything to the chance of\r\nour continuing in the same unselfish frame of mind we were really in\r\nwhen the Spanish-American War started, Aguinaldo and his people, not\r\nsure but what in the wind-up they might even be thrown back upon the\r\ntender mercies of Spain, played their cards boldly and consistently\r\nfrom the beginning with a view of organizing a de facto government\r\nand getting it recognized by the Powers as such at the very earliest\r\npracticable moment. They believed that the Lord helps those who help\r\nthemselves. They had anticipated our change of heart and already had\r\nit discounted before we were aware of it ourselves. They were already\r\nacting on the idea that eternal vigilance is the price of liberty\r\nwhile public opinion in the United States concerning them was in a\r\nchrysalis state, and trying to develop a new definition of Liberty\r\nwhich should comport with the subjugation of distant island subjects\r\nby a continental commonwealth on the other side of the world based on\r\nrepresentative government. The prospective subjects did not believe\r\nthat a legislature ten thousand miles away in which they had no vote\r\nwould ever give them a square deal about tariff and other laws dictated\r\nby special interests. They had had three hundred years of just that\r\nvery sort of thing under Spain and instinctively dreaded continuance\r\nof it. That their instincts did not deceive them, our later study of\r\nCongressional legislation will show. The Filipinos had greatly pondered\r\ntheir future in their hearts during the last twelve months of Spain's\r\ncolonial empire, watching her Cuban embarrassments with eager eye.\r\n\r\nHaving seen the frame of mind in which they approached the contract\r\nimplied in Admiral Dewey's cheery words, \"Well now, go ashore there\r\nand start your army,\" what were the facts of recent history within\r\nthe knowledge of both parties at the time? What had been the screams\r\nof the American eagle, if any, concerning his moral leadership of\r\nthe family of unfeathered bipeds?\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley's annual message to Congress of December, 1897,\r\n[31] calling attention to conditions in Cuba as intolerable,\r\nhad declared that if we should intervene to put a stop to them,\r\nwe certainly would not make it the occasion of a land-grab. The\r\nother nations said: \"We are from Missouri.\" But Mr. McKinley said,\r\n\"forcible annexation\" was not to be thought of by us. \"That by\r\nour code of morality would be criminal,\" etc. So the world said,\r\n\"We shall see what we shall see.\" Then had come the war message\r\nof April 11, 1898, [32] reiterating the declaration of the Cuban\r\nmessage of December previous, that \"forcible annexation by our code of\r\nmorality would be criminal aggression.\" In other words we announced\r\nto the overcrowded monarchies of the old world, whose land-lust is\r\never tempted by the broad acres of South America, and ever cooled\r\nby the virile menace of the Monroe doctrine, that we not only were\r\nagainst the principle of land-grabbing, but would not indulge in the\r\npractice. Immediately upon the conclusion of the reading of the war\r\nmessage, Senator Stewart was recognized, and said, among other things:\r\n\"Under the law of nations, intervention for conquest is condemned,\r\nand is opposed to the universal sentiment of mankind. It is unjust,\r\nit is robbery, to intervene for conquest.\" Then Mr. Lodge stood up,\r\n\"in the Senate House a Senator,\" and said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are there [meaning in this present Cuban situation] because we\r\n    represent the spirit of liberty and the spirit of the new time, and\r\n    Spain is over against us because she is mediaeval, cruel, dying. We\r\n    have grasped no man's territory, we have taken no man's property,\r\n    we have invaded no man's rights. We do not ask their lands. [33]\r\n\r\n\r\nThese speeches went forth to the world almost like a part of the\r\nmessage itself. And Admiral Dewey, like every other American, in\r\nhis early dealings with Aguinaldo, after war broke out, must have\r\nassumed a mental attitude in harmony with these announcements. But\r\nthe world said, \"All this is merely what you Americans yourselves\r\ncall 'hot air.' We repeat, 'We are from Missouri.'\" Then we said:\r\n\"Oh very well, we will show you.\" So in the declaration of war against\r\nSpain we inserted the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Fourth: That the United States hereby disclaims any disposition or\r\n    intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over\r\n    said island except for the pacification thereof, and asserts its\r\n    determination when that is accomplished, to leave the government\r\n    and control of the island to its people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis meant, \"It is true we do love the Almighty Dollar very dearly,\r\noh, Sisters of the Family of Nations, but there are some axiomatic\r\nprinciples of human liberty that we love better, and one of them is the\r\n'unalienable right' of every people to pursue happiness in their own\r\nway, free from alien domination.\" All these things were well known to\r\nboth the contracting parties when Admiral Dewey set Aguinaldo ashore\r\nat Cavite, May 20, 1898, and got him to start his insurrection \"under\r\nthe protection of our guns,\" as he expressed it. [34] Accordingly,\r\nwhen the insurgent leader went ashore, the declaration of war was\r\nhis major premise, the assurances of our consuls and the acts of our\r\nAdmiral pursuant thereto were his minor premise, and Independence was\r\nhis conclusion. Trusting to the faith and honor of the American people,\r\nhe took his life in his hands, left the panoplied safety of our mighty\r\nsquadron, and plunged, single-handed, into the struggle for Freedom.\r\n\r\nWhat was the state of the public mind on shore, and how was it\r\nprepared to receive his assurances of American aid? Consider the\r\nfollowing picture in the light of its sombre sequel.\r\n\r\nJust as the war broke out, Consul Williams had left Manila and gone\r\nover to Hong Kong, where he joined Admiral Dewey, and accompanied him\r\nback to Manila, and was thus privileged to be present at the battle\r\nof Manila Bay, May 1st. Under date of May 12th, from his consular\r\nheadquarters aboard the U. S. S. Baltimore, he reports [35] going\r\nashore at Cavite and being received with enthusiastic greetings by\r\nvast crowds of Filipinos. \"They crowded around me,\" says Brother\r\nWilliams, \"hats off, shouting 'Viva los Americanos,' thronged about\r\nme by hundreds to shake either hand, even several at a time, men,\r\nwomen, and children, striving to get even a finger to shake. So I\r\nmoved half a mile, shaking continuously with both hands.\"\r\n\r\nTut! tut! says the casual reader. What did the Government at\r\nWashington know of all these goings on, that it should be charged\r\nlater with having violated as binding a moral obligation as ever a\r\nnation assumed? It is true that the news of the Williams ovation,\r\nas in the case of the Pratt serenade, reached Washington only by the\r\nslow channels of the mail. But Washington did in fact receive the\r\nsaid news by due course of mail. When it came, however, Washington\r\nwas nursing visions of savages in blankets smoking the pipe of peace\r\nwith the agents of the Great White Father in the White House--i.e.,\r\nthought, or hoped, the Filipinos were savages--and remained as deaf\r\nto the sounds of the Williams ovation as it had been to the strains\r\nof the Pratt serenade.\r\n\r\nHowever, hardly had Admiral Dewey taken his binoculars from the gig\r\nthat carried Aguinaldo ashore to raise his auxiliary insurrection,\r\nwhen he called his Flag Secretary, or the equivalent, and dictated\r\nthe following cablegram to the Secretary of the Navy:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aguinaldo, the rebel commander-in-chief, was brought down by\r\n    the McCulloch. Organizing forces near Cavite, and may render\r\n    assistance that will be valuable. [36]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis sounds a little more serious than \"earnest boys\" alleging the\r\nlack of a toothbrush as an excuse for declining mortal combat, does\r\nit not? How valuable did this assistance prove? Admiral Dewey had to\r\nwait three and one half months for the army to arrive, and this is\r\nhow the commanding general of the American forces describes conditions\r\nas he found them in the latter part of August:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For three and one half months Admiral Dewey with his squadron\r\n    and the insurgents on land had kept Manila tightly bottled. All\r\n    commerce had been interdicted, internal trade paralyzed, and food\r\n    supplies were nearly exhausted. [37]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd, he might have added, the taking of the city was thus made\r\nperfectly easy. Otherwise, as Aguinaldo put it in one of his letters\r\nto General Otis, we would not have taken a city, but only the ruins\r\nof a city. Admiral Dewey said to the Senate Committee in 1902: \"They\r\n[the Spaniards] surrendered on August 13th, and they had not gotten\r\na thing in after the 1st of May.\" [38]\r\n\r\nIn the early part of the next year, 1899, President McKinley sent\r\nout a kind of olive-branch commission, of which President Schurman\r\nof Cornell University was Chairman. The olive branch got withered\r\nin the sulphur of exploding gun-powder, so the Commission contented\r\nitself with making a report. And this is what they said concerning\r\nwhat followed the Dewey-Aguinaldo entente:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Shortly afterwards, the Filipinos began to attack the\r\n    Spanish. Their number was rapidly augmented by the militia who\r\n    had been given arms by Spain, all of whom revolted and joined\r\n    the insurgents. Great Filipino successes followed, many Spaniards\r\n    were taken prisoners, and while the Spanish troops now remained\r\n    quietly in Manila, the Filipino forces made themselves masters\r\n    of the entire island [of Luzon] except that city. [39]\r\n\r\n\r\nOf conditions in July, sixty days after Admiral Dewey had on May 20th\r\nsaid to Aguinaldo in effect, \"Go it, little man, we need you in our\r\nbusiness,\" Mr. Wildman, our Consul at Hong Kong, writing to the State\r\nDepartment, said, in defending himself for his share in the business\r\nof getting Aguinaldo's help under promises, both express and implied,\r\nwhich were subsequently repudiated, that after he, Wildman, put the\r\ninsurgent chief aboard the McCulloch, May 16th, bound for Manila to\r\nco-operate by land with our navy: \"He * * * organized a government\r\n* * * and from that day to this he has been uninterruptedly successful\r\nin the field and dignified and just as the head of his government,\"\r\n[40] a statement which Admiral Dewey subsequently endorsed. [41]\r\n\r\nWe have seen the preliminaries of this \"government\" started under\r\nthe auspices of our Admiral and under what he himself called \"the\r\nprotection of our guns\" (ante). Let us note its progress. If you\r\nturn the leaves of the contemporaneous official reports, you see\r\nquite a moving picture show, and the action is rapid. On May 24th,\r\nstill \"under the protection of our guns,\" Aguinaldo proclaimed his\r\nrevolutionary government and summoned the people to his standard for\r\nthe purpose of driving the Spaniards out forever. The situation was an\r\nexact counterpart of the cotemporary Cuban one as regards identity of\r\npurpose between \"liberator\" and \"oppressed.\" His proclamation promised\r\na constitutional convention to be called later (and which was duly\r\ncalled later) to elect a President and Cabinet, in whose favor he\r\nwould resign the emergency authority now assumed; referred to the\r\nUnited States as \"undoubtedly disinterested\" and as considering the\r\nFilipinos \"capable of governing for ourselves our unfortunate country\";\r\nand formally announced the temporary assumption of supreme authority\r\nas dictator. Copies of these proclamations were duly furnished Admiral\r\nDewey. The latter was too busy looking after the men behind his guns\r\nand watching the progress of his plucky little ally to study Spanish,\r\nso he forwarded them to the Navy Department without comment--\"without\r\nreading them,\" said he to the Senate Committee in 1902. [42] When his\r\nattention was called to them before the Committee by one of the members\r\nreading them, his comment was, \"Nothing about independence there, is\r\nthere?\" [43] It seems to me it did not take an international lawyer\r\nto see a good deal \"there,\" about independence. In a proclamation\r\npublished at Tarlac in the latter part of 1899, which appears to have\r\nbeen a sort of swan-song of the Philippine Republic, Aguinaldo had\r\nsaid, in effect, \"Certainly Admiral Dewey did not bring me from Hong\r\nKong to Manila to fight the Spaniards for the benefit of American\r\nTrade Expansion,\" and in this proclamation he claimed that Admiral\r\nDewey promised him independence. It is true, that in a letter to\r\nSenator Lodge, which that distinguished gentleman read on the floor\r\nof the Senate on January 31, 1900, Admiral Dewey denounced this last\r\nstatement as false. It is also true that those Americans are few and\r\nfar between who will take Aguinaldo's word in preference to Admiral\r\nDewey's. Certainly the writer is not one of them. But Aguinaldo\r\nis no Spanish scholar, being more of a leader of men than a master\r\nof language, and what sort of an interpreter acted between him and\r\nthe Admiral does not appear. Certainly he never did get anything in\r\nwriting from Admiral Dewey. But after the latter brought him to Manila,\r\nset him to fighting the common enemy, and helped him with guns and\r\notherwise in quickly organizing an army for the purpose, the Admiral\r\nwas at least put on inquiry as to just what Aguinaldo supposed he was\r\nfighting for. What did the Admiral probably suppose? He told the Senate\r\nCommittee that the idea that they wanted independence \"never entered\r\nhis head.\" The roar of mighty guns seems to have made it difficult for\r\nhim to hear the prattlings of what Aguinaldo's proclamations of the\r\ntime called \"the legitimate aspirations of a people.\" The milk in the\r\ncocoanut is this: How could it ever occur to a great naval commander,\r\nsuch as Admiral Dewey, familiar with the four quarters of the globe,\r\nthat a coterie of politicians at home would be so foolish as to buy\r\na vast straggly archipelago of jungle-covered islands in the South\r\nSeas which had been a nuisance to every government that ever owned\r\nthem? But let us turn from the Senate Committee's studies of 1902 to\r\nthe progress of the infant republic of 1898 at Cavite.\r\n\r\nThe same day the above proclamations of May 24th were issued, we\r\nfind Consul Williams, now become a sort of amphibious civilian\r\naide to Dewey, having his consular headquarters afloat, on the\r\nU. S. S. Baltimore, of the squadron, writing the State Department,\r\ndescribing the great successes of the insurgents, his various\r\nconferences with Aguinaldo and the other leaders, and his own\r\nactivities in arranging the execution of a power of attorney whereby\r\nAguinaldo released to certain parties in Hong Kong $400,000 then\r\non deposit to his credit in a Hong Kong bank, for the purpose of\r\nenabling them to pay for 3000 stand of arms bought there and expected\r\nto arrive at Cavite on the morrow, and for other needed expenses of the\r\nrevolutionary movement. He says, in part: \"Officers have visited me\r\nduring the darkness of the night to inform the fleet and me of their\r\noperations, and to report increase of strength. When General Merritt\r\narrives he will find large auxiliary land forces adapted to his service\r\nand used to the climate.\" [44] Throughout this period Admiral Dewey\r\nreports various cordial conferences with Aguinaldo, though he is not so\r\nliterary as to vivify his accounts with allusions to the weather. In\r\none despatch he states that he has \"refrained from assisting him * * *\r\nwith the forces under my command\" [45]--explaining to him that \"the\r\nsquadron could not act until the arrival of the United States troops.\"\r\n\r\nSix days after the issuance of the Dictatorship proclamations above\r\nmentioned, viz., on May 30th, Admiral Dewey cables the Navy Department\r\n[46]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aguinaldo, revolutionary leader, visited Olympia yesterday. He\r\n    expects to make general attack May 31st.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe did not succeed entirely, but there was hard fighting, and the\r\ncordon around the doomed Spaniards in Manila and its suburbs was\r\ndrawn ever closer and closer.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable feat of Aguinaldo's raising a right formidable fighting\r\nforce in twelve days after his little \"Return from Elba,\" which force\r\nkept growing like a snowball, is difficult, for one who does not know\r\nthe Filipinos, and the conditions then, to credit. It is explained\r\nby the fact that Admiral Dewey let him have the captured guns in the\r\nCavite arsenal, that Cavite was a populous hotbed of insurrection,\r\nand that many native regiments, or parts of regiments, quite suited\r\nto be the nucleus of an army, having lots of veteran non-commissioned\r\nofficers, deserted the Spaniards and went over to the insurgents,\r\ntheir countrymen, as soon as Aguinaldo arrived.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, we have another bulletin sent to the Navy Department\r\nby Admiral Dewey, transmitting with perceptible satisfaction further\r\ninformation as to the progress of his indefatigable protege:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Insurgents have been engaged actively within the province of Cavite\r\n    during the last week; they have had several small victories,\r\n    taking prisoners about 1800 men, 50 officers; Spanish troops,\r\n    not native. [47]\r\n\r\n\r\nAlong about this period Aguinaldo happens to get hold of a belated\r\ncopy of the London Times of May 5, 1898. It contains considerable\r\nspeculation on the future of the Philippines which casts a shadow\r\nover the soul of the president of the incipient republic. Having read\r\nPresident McKinley's immortal State papers about the moral obliquity\r\nof \"forcible annexation,\" he is moved to write direct to the source\r\nof those noble sentiments. The letter is dated June 10, 1898. It is\r\naddressed, with a quaintness now pathetic, \"To the President of the\r\nRepublic of the Great North American Nation.\" It greets the addressee\r\nwith \"the most tender effusion of\" the writer's soul, expresses his\r\n\"deep and sincere gratitude,\" in the name of his people, \"for the\r\nefficient and disinterested protection which you have decided to give\r\nit to shake off the yoke of the cruel and corrupt Spanish domination,\r\nas you are doing to the equally unfortunate Cuba\" and then proceeds to\r\ntell of \"the great sorrow which all of us Filipinos felt on reading\r\nin the Times the astounding statement that you, sir, will retain\r\nthese islands,\" etc. He proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Philippine people * * * have seen in your nation, ever since\r\n    your fleet destroyed in a moment the Spanish fleet which was here\r\n    * * * the angel who is the harbinger of their liberty; and they\r\n    rose like a single wave * * * as soon as I trod these shores; and\r\n    captured in ten days nearly the whole garrison of this Province\r\n    of Cavite in whose port I have my government--by the consent of\r\n    the Admiral of your triumphant fleet. [48]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer closes his letter with an impassioned protest against\r\nthe occurrence of what is suggested in the Times, and speaks of\r\nhis fellow-countrymen as \"a people which trusts blindly in you not\r\nto abandon it to the tyranny of Spain, but to leave it free and\r\nindependent,\" and adds his \"fervent prayers for the ever-increasing\r\nprosperity of your powerful nation.\" [49]\r\n\r\nBut the signer of the foregoing letter did not spend all his time\r\npraying for us, as may be observed in this bulletin from Admiral Dewey\r\nconcerning the way he was lambasting the common enemy, sent the Navy\r\nDepartment, June 12th:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Insurgents continue hostilities and have practically surrounded\r\n    Manila. They have taken 2500 Spanish prisoners, whom they treat\r\n    most humanely. They do not intend to attack city proper until\r\n    the arrival of United States troops thither; I have advised. [50]\r\n\r\n\r\nFour days later Washington chided the hapless Pratt at Singapore about\r\nhaving talked to Aguinaldo of \"direct co-operation\" with Admiral Dewey,\r\nsaying: \"To obtain the unconditional personal assistance of General\r\nAguinaldo in the expedition to Manila was proper, if in so doing he\r\nwas not induced to form hopes which it might not be practicable to\r\ngratify.\" [51] This communication goes on to advise Mr. Pratt that the\r\nDepartment cannot approve anything he may have said to Aguinaldo on\r\nbehalf of the United States which would concede that in accepting his\r\nco-operation we would owe him anything. Yet it did not tell Admiral\r\nDewey to quit coaching him, because the service he was rendering\r\nwas too valuable. There is no communication to Admiral Dewey about\r\n\"hopes which it might not be practicable to gratify\" in the official\r\narchives of those times. There was Admiral Dewey coaching Aguinaldo\r\nand telling him to wait for the main attack until General Merritt\r\nshould arrive with our troops. Why? Because he expected Merritt to\r\nco-operate with Aguinaldo, and of course Aguinaldo expected exactly\r\nwhat Dewey expected.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the history of those times the writer has not been\r\nso careless as to have overlooked Senator Lodge's elaborate speech\r\nin the Senate on March 7, 1900, wherein attention is called to the\r\ncircumstance that a few days after Aguinaldo landed at Cavite, the\r\nNavy Department cabled cautioning Dewey to have no alliance with him\r\nthat might complicate us, and that the Admiral answered he had made no\r\nalliance and would make none. But if actions speak louder than words,\r\nthe Senator's point does not rise above the dignity of a technicality.\r\n\r\nThe same day the State Department reprimanded Pratt, as above\r\nindicated, viz., June 16th, Consul Williams at Manila wrote them\r\na glowing communication [52] about how \"active and almost uniformly\r\nsuccessful\" Aguinaldo was continuing to be. But no resultant enthusiasm\r\nis of record. Two days later, on June 18th, Aguinaldo issued his\r\nfirst formal Declaration of Independence. The infant republic was now\r\nless than a month old, but it already had a fine set of teeth. The\r\nSpaniards had seen them. The proclamation was of course addressed to\r\nthe Filipino people, and called on them to rally to the cause, but\r\nhe was also driving at recognition by the Powers. It read in part:\r\n\"In the face of the whole world I have proclaimed that the aspiration\r\nof my whole life, the final object of all my wishes and efforts,\r\nis your independence, because I have the inner conviction that it is\r\nalso your constant longing.\" [53] Many Americans insist that this is\r\nmere \"hot air\" and that the average Filipino peasant does not think\r\nmuch more than his plough animal, the scoffer himself being stupidly\r\nunaware that this has been precisely the argument of tyranny in all\r\nages. But the pride a people will have in seeing the best educated\r\nand most able men of their own race in charge of their affairs seems\r\nto me too obvious to need elaboration. It was always accepted by us\r\nas axiomatic until we took the Philippines. It is a cruel species of\r\nwickedness for an American to tell his countrymen that the Filipino\r\npeople do not want independence, for some of them may believe it.\r\n\r\nThe Declaration of Independence of June 18th is known to students\r\nof Philippine political archaeology as the Proclamation establishing\r\nthe \"dictatorial\" government. The principal thing it did was to\r\nsupplement the absolute dictatorship proclaimed May 24th by provisions\r\nfor organizing in detail. It also declared independence. A more\r\nelaborate Declaration followed on June 23d, known as the proclamation\r\nestablishing the \"revolutionary\" government. This made provision\r\nfor a Congress, a Cabinet, and courts. Of course it was only a paper\r\ngovernment the day the ink dried on it. But we will follow it through\r\nits teething, and adolescence, to the attainment of its majority at\r\nan inauguration where the president was driven to the place of the\r\ntaking of the oath of office in a coach and four, through a short\r\nand very self-respecting heyday, and a longer peripatetic existence,\r\nto final dissolution. The document of June 23d reminds us of a fact\r\nwhich in reading it at this late date we are apt to forget, viz.,\r\nthat the Filipinos did not know at what moment their powerful ally,\r\nthe American squadron, might up anchor and sail away to the high\r\nseas, to meet another Spanish fleet; thus leaving them to the tender\r\nmercies of the Spaniards, possibly forever. So they were losing no\r\ntime. In fact, they had set to work from the very beginning with a\r\ndetermination to try and secure recognition from the Powers at the\r\nearliest moment. In appealing to the public opinion of the world with a\r\nview of paving the way to recognition by the Powers--which recognition\r\nwould mean getting arms for war with Spain or any other power without\r\nthe inconveniences of filibustering--Aguinaldo says on behalf of his\r\npeople in the proclamation of June 23d, above mentioned, that they\r\n\"now no longer limit themselves to asking for assimilation with the\r\npolitical constitution of Spain, but ask for a complete separation\r\n(and) strive for independence, completely assured that the time has\r\ncome when they can and ought to govern themselves.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Frank D. Millet, who reached Manila soon enough (in July) to\r\nsee the ripples of this proclamation, describes the effect on the\r\npeople. While Mr. Millet is one of the best men that anybody ever knew,\r\na proposition as to which I am quite sure the President of the United\r\nStates and many people great and small in many lands would affirm my\r\njudgment, [54] still, he writes from a frankly White Man's Burden or\r\nland-grabbing standpoint--is in harmony with his environment. At\r\npage 50 of his book, [55] he reproduces the proclamation last\r\nabove quoted from, and adds the following satirical comment: \"This\r\nflowery production was widely circulated and had a great effect on\r\nthe imagination of the people, who, in the elation of their present\r\nsuccess in investing the town and in their belief that the United\r\nStates was beginning a campaign in the Philippines to free them from\r\nSpanish oppression (italics mine) shortly came to think that they\r\nwere already a nation.\"\r\n\r\nCopies of these June proclamations also, as in the case of those\r\nof May 24th, were duly forwarded by Aguinaldo to Admiral Dewey\r\n[56] and by him forwarded to Washington without comment. In his\r\nletter transmitting them to Dewey, Aguinaldo announces that his\r\ngovernment has \"taken possession of the various provinces of the\r\narchipelago.\" Just exactly how many provinces he had control of on\r\nJune 23d will be examined later. The very same day the proclamation\r\nof June 23d declaring independence was issued, Admiral Dewey cabled\r\nthe Navy Department [57]: \"Aguinaldo has acted independently of the\r\nsquadron, but has kept me advised of his progress which has been\r\nwonderful. I have allowed him to take from the arsenal such Spanish\r\narms and ammunition as he needed.\" After adding that \"Aguinaldo\r\nexpects to capture Manila without any assistance,\" the Admiral,\r\nevidently divining the temptation that was then luring the political\r\nSt. Anthonies at Washington, volunteers this timely suggestion:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In my opinion these people are superior in intelligence and more\r\n    capable of self-government than the natives of Cuba, and I am\r\n    familiar with both races. [57]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there may be no doubt about the motive behind that suggestion,\r\nit may be noted here that the Admiral told the Senate Committee in\r\n1902: \"I wrote that because I saw in the newspapers that Congress\r\ncontemplated giving the Cubans independence.\" [58]\r\n\r\nBut this is not all. On August 13th, the day after the Peace\r\nProtocol was signed, Mr. McKinley wired Admiral Dewey asking about\r\n\"the desirability of the several islands,\" the \"coal and mineral\r\ndeposits,\" and in reply on August 29th, the Admiral wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In a telegram sent the Department on June 23d, I expressed the\r\n    opinion that \"these people are far superior in their intelligence\r\n    and more capable of self-government than the natives of Cuba,\r\n    and I am familiar with both races.\" Further intercourse with them\r\n    has confirmed me in this opinion. [59]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of one year's stay in Cuba, and six in the Philippines--two\r\nin the army that subjugated the Filipinos and four as a judge over\r\nthem--I heartily concur in the above opinion of Admiral Dewey,\r\nbut with this addition: Whatever of solidarity for governmental\r\npurposes the Filipinos may have lacked at the date of the Admiral's\r\ncommunications, they were certainly welded into conscious political\r\nunity, as one people, in their war for independence against us.\r\n\r\nIn the 1609 or Douay (pronounce Dewey) version of the Bible, the\r\nLatin Vulgate, Luke's version of the Lord's Prayer only says \"Lead\r\nus not into temptation,\" while Matthew adds \"but deliver us from\r\nevil.\" The Dewey suggestions to the Washington Government in 1898\r\nremind a regretful nation of both the evangelical versions mentioned,\r\nfor the first seems to say what Luke says, and the second seems to\r\nadd what Matthew adds.\r\n\r\nThere is not an American who has known the Filipinos since the\r\nbeginning of the American occupation who doubts for a moment that\r\nbut for our intervention a Republic would have been established out\r\nthere under the lead of Aguinaldo, Mabini, and their associates,\r\nwhich would have compared well with the republican governments\r\nbetween the United States and Cape Horn. The writer doubts very\r\nmuch if President Taft is of a contrary opinion. The real issue is,\r\nnow that we have them, should we keep them in spite of the tariff\r\niniquities which the Trusts perpetrate on them through Congress,\r\nuntil they have received the best possible tuition we can give them,\r\nor be content to give them their independence when they are already at\r\nleast as fit for it as the Republics to the South of us, guaranteeing\r\nthem independence by international agreement like that which protects\r\nBelgium and Switzerland?\r\n\r\nNow why did Admiral Dewey repeat to his home government and emphasize\r\non August 29th a suggestion so extremely pertinent to the capacity of\r\nthe Filipinos for self-government which he had already made in lucid\r\nlanguage on June 23d previous? The answer is not far to seek. General\r\nAnderson had arrived between the two dates, with the first American\r\ntroops that reached the islands after the naval battle of May 1st,\r\nand brought the Admiral the first intimation, which came somewhat as\r\na surprise of course, that there was serious talk in the United States\r\nof retaining the Philippines. \"I was the first to tell Admiral Dewey,\"\r\nsays General Anderson in the North American Review for February, 1900,\r\n\"that there was any disposition on the part of the American people to\r\nhold the Philippines if they were captured.\" He adds: \"Whether Admiral\r\nDewey and Consuls Pratt, Wildman, and Williams did or did not give\r\nAguinaldo assurances that a Filipino government would be recognized,\r\nthe Filipinos certainly thought so, judging from their acts rather\r\nthan from their words. Admiral Dewey gave them arms and ammunition,\r\nas I did subsequently at his request.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Anderson might have added that whenever the Admiral captured\r\nprisoners from the Spaniards he would promptly turn them over to the\r\nFilipinos--1300 at one clip in the month of June at Olongapo. [60]\r\nThese 1300 were men a German man-of-war prevented the Filipinos from\r\ntaking until Aguinaldo reported the matter to Admiral Dewey, whereupon,\r\nhe promptly sent Captain Coghlan with the Raleigh and another of his\r\nships to the scene of the trouble, and Captain Coghlan said to the\r\nGerman \"Hoch der Kaiser\" etc. or words to that effect, and made him\r\ngo about his business and let our ally alone. Then Captain Coghlan\r\ntook the 1300 prisoners himself and turned them over to Aguinaldo by\r\ndirection of Admiral Dewey. The motive for, as well as the test of,\r\nan alliance, is that the other fellow can bring into the partnership\r\nsomething you lack. The navy had no way to keep prisoners of war. There\r\ncan be no doubt that if Admiral Dewey's original notions about meeting\r\nthe problems presented by his great victory of May 1, 1898, had been\r\nfollowed, we never would have had any trouble with the Filipinos;\r\nnor can there be any doubt that he made them his allies and used\r\nthem as such. They were very obedient allies at that, until they\r\nsaw the Washington Government was going to repudiate the \"alliance,\"\r\nand withhold from them what they had a right to consider the object\r\nand meaning of the alliance, if it meant anything.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, as Secretary of War Taft said in 1905, before the\r\nNational Geographic Society in Washington, \"We blundered into\r\ncolonization.\" [61] As we have seen, Admiral Dewey repeatedly\r\nexpressed the opinion, in the summer of 1898, that the Filipinos\r\nwere far superior in intelligence to the Cubans and more capable\r\nof self-government. He of course saw quite clearly then, when\r\nhe was sending home those commendations of Filipino fitness for\r\nself-government, just as we have all come to realize since, that a\r\ncoaling station would be; the main thing we should need in that part\r\nof the world in time of war; that Manila, being quite away from the\r\nmainland of Asia, could never supersede Hong Kong as the gateway to\r\nthe markets of Asia, since neither shippers nor the carrying trade of\r\nthe world will ever see their way to unload cargo at Manila by way of\r\nrehearsal before unloading on the mainland; and that the taking of the\r\nislands was a dubious step from a financial standpoint, and a still\r\nmore dubious one from the strategic standpoint of defending them by\r\nland, in the event of war with Japan, Germany, or any other first-class\r\npower. At this late date, when the passions and controversies of that\r\nperiod have long since subsided, is it not perfectly clear that after\r\nhe destroyed the Spanish fleet, Admiral Dewey not only dealt with the\r\nFilipinos, until the army came out, substantially as Admiral Sampson\r\nand General Shatter did with the Cubans, but also that he did all he\r\nproperly could to save President McKinley from the one great blunder\r\nof our history, the taking of the Philippine Islands?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nANDERSON AND AGUINALDO\r\n\r\n                        Well, honor is the subject of my story.\r\n\r\n                                            Julius Caesar, Act. I, Sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the Spanish fleet in Manila Bay on May 1, 1898,\r\nten days after the outbreak of the war with Spain, having necessitated\r\nsending troops to the Philippines to complete the reduction of the\r\nSpanish power in that quarter, Major-General Wesley Merritt was on\r\nMay 16th selected to organize and command such an expedition.\r\n\r\n\"The First Expedition,\" as it was always distinguished, by the officers\r\nand men of the Eighth Army Corps, there having been many subsequent\r\nexpeditions sent out before our war with the Filipinos was over,\r\nwas itself subdivided into a number of different expeditions, troops\r\nbeing hurried to Manila as fast as they could be assembled and properly\r\nequipped in sufficient numbers. The first batch that were whipped into\r\nshape left San Francisco under command of Brigadier-General Thomas\r\nM. Anderson, on May 25th, and arrived off Manila, June 30th. General\r\nMerritt did not arrive until July 25th. It was General Anderson,\r\ntherefore, who broke the ice of the American occupation of the\r\nPhilippines.\r\n\r\nIn his annual message to Congress of December, following, [62]\r\nsumming up the War with Spain and its results, Mr. McKinley gives\r\na brief account of the First Expedition. After recounting Admiral\r\nDewey's victory of May 1st previous, he states that \"on the seventh\r\nday of May the Government was advised officially of the victory at\r\nManila, and at once inquired of the commander of the fleet what troops\r\nwould be required.\" President McKinley does not give the Admiral's\r\nanswer, though he does state that it was received on the 15th day of\r\nMay. The Admiral's answer appears, however, in the Report of the Navy\r\nDepartment for 1898, Appendix, page 98. It was: \"In my best judgment,\r\na well-equipped force of 5000 men.\" But the President's message does\r\nstate that he at once sent a \"total force consisting of 641 officers\r\nand 15,058 enlisted men.\"\r\n\r\nThe difference of view-point of the Admiral and the President is clear\r\nfrom the language of both. In recommending 5000 troops, the Admiral\r\nhad said they would be necessary \"to retain possession [of Manila]\r\nand thus control Philippine Islands.\" This counted, of course, on the\r\nfriendship of the people, as in Cuba. \"I had in view simply taking\r\npossession of the city.\" said Admiral Dewey to the Senate Committee\r\nin 1902. [63]\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the President in sending three times as many troops as\r\nwere needed for the purpose Admiral Dewey had in mind is indicated in\r\nhis account of what happened. After describing the taking of Manila\r\nby our troops on August 13th, the presidential message says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    By this the conquest of the Philippine Islands, virtually\r\n    accomplished when the Spanish capacity for resistance was destroyed\r\n    by Admiral Dewey's victory of May 1st, was formally sealed. [64]\r\n\r\n\r\nAdmiral Dewey contemplated that we should merely remain masters of the\r\nsituation out where he was until the end of the war. President McKinley\r\nset about to effect \"the conquest of the Philippine Islands.\" The\r\nnaval victory of Manila Bay having made it certain that at the\r\nconclusion of our war against a decadent monarchy we would at last\r\nhave an adequate coaling station and naval base in the Far East, the\r\nsending of troops to the Philippines, in appropriate prosecution of\r\nthe war, to reduce and capture Manila, the capital and chief port,\r\nraised the question at once \"And then what?\"\r\n\r\nThe genesis of the idea of taking over the archipelago is traceable\r\nto within a few days after the destruction of the Spanish fleet.\r\n\r\nWithin a few days after the official news of the battle of Manila\r\nBay reached Washington, the Treasury Department set a man to work\r\nmaking a \"Report on Financial and Industrial Conditions of the\r\nPhilippine Islands.\" [65] The Interior Department also awoke, about\r\nthe same time to possibilities of an El Dorado in the new overseas\r\nconquest. \"In May, 1898,\" says Secretary of the Interior, C. N. Bliss,\r\nin a letter intended for the Peace Commissioners who met at Paris\r\nthat fall, \"by arrangement between the Secretary of War with this\r\nDepartment\"--Mr. Bliss's grammar is bad, but his meaning is plain--\"a\r\ngeologist of the United States Geological Survey accompanied the\r\nmilitary expedition to the Philippines for the purpose of procuring\r\ninformation touching the geological and mineral resources of said\r\nislands.\" [66] This report, which accompanies the Bliss letter, reads\r\nlike a mining stock prospectus. That summer an Assistant Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury, presumably echoing the sentiments of the Administration,\r\ncame out in one of the great magazines of the period, the Century,\r\nwith an article in which he said: \"We see with sudden clearness that\r\nsome of the most revered of our political maxims have outlived their\r\nforce. * * * A new mainspring * * * has become the directing force\r\n* * * the mainspring of commercialism.\" [67] Of course, the writer did\r\nnot mention that Manila is an out-of-the-way place, so far as regards\r\nthe main-travelled routes across the Pacific Ocean, and also forgot\r\nthat, as has been suggested once before, the carrying trade of the\r\nworld, and the shippers on which it depends, in the contest of the\r\nnations for the markets of Asia, would never take to the practice of\r\nunloading at Manila by way of rehearsal, before finally discharging\r\ncargo on the mainland of Asia, where the name of the Ultimate\r\nConsumer is legion. Nevertheless \"Expansion\"--of Trade, mainly--was\r\nthe slogan of the hour, and any one who did not catch the contagion\r\nof exuberant allusion to \"Our New Possessions\" was considered crusty\r\nand out of date. People who referred back to the political maxims of\r\nWashington's Farewell Address, and the cognate set represented by the\r\nMonroe Doctrine, were regarded merely as not knowing a good thing\r\nwhen they saw it. So on rode the country, on the crest of the wave\r\nof war. When President McKinley sent the troops to the Philippines,\r\ntheir job was to hurry up and effect what his subsequent message to\r\nCongress describing their work called \"the conquest of the Philippine\r\nIslands.\" That is, they were to effect a constructive conquest of\r\nthe archipelago before Spain should sue for peace. It never seemed\r\nto occur to anybody at home that the Filipinos would object. If the\r\ncountry had, through some divine interposition, gotten it into its\r\nhead that the Filipinos were quite a decent lot and really did object\r\nvery bitterly, it would have risen in its wrath and smitten down any\r\nsuggestion of forcing a government on them against their will. But\r\nnobody knew anything about them. They were a wholly new proposition.\r\n\r\nGeneral Anderson was of course furnished with a copy of the President's\r\ninstructions to his chief, General Merritt. They are quite long,\r\nand go into details about a number of administrative matters that\r\nwould necessarily come up after the city should surrender, such as\r\nthe raising of revenue, the military commander's duty under the law\r\nof nations with regard to the seizure of transportation lines by\r\nland or sea, the protection of places of worship from desecration or\r\ndestruction, and the like. The only portion of them that is essential\r\nto a clear understanding of subsequent events is now submitted:\r\nThey are dated Executive Mansion, May 18, 1898, and read in part [68]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    PRESIDENT McKINLEY'S INSTRUCTIONS TO GENERAL MERRITT\r\n\r\n    The destruction of the Spanish fleet at Manila, followed by\r\n    the taking of the naval station at Cavite, the paroling of the\r\n    garrisons, and acquisition of control of the bay, have rendered\r\n    it necessary, in the further prosecution of the measures adopted\r\n    by this Government for the purpose of bringing about an honorable\r\n    and durable peace with Spain, to send an army of occupation to the\r\n    Philippines for the twofold purpose of completing the reduction of\r\n    the Spanish power in that quarter, and of giving order and security\r\n    to the islands while in the possession of the United States.\r\n\r\n    For the command of this expedition I have designated Major-General\r\n    Wesley Merritt, and it now becomes my duty to give instructions\r\n    as to the manner in which the movements shall be conducted.\r\n\r\n    The first effect of the military occupation of the enemy's\r\n    territory is the severance of the former political relations of the\r\n    inhabitants and the establishment of a new political power. Under\r\n    this changed condition of things the inhabitants, so long as they\r\n    perform their duties, are entitled to security in their persons\r\n    and property and in all their private rights and relations. It is\r\n    my desire that the people of the Philippines should be acquainted\r\n    with the purpose of the United States to discharge to the fullest\r\n    extent its obligations in this regard. It will therefore be\r\n    the duty of the commander of the expedition, immediately upon\r\n    his arrival in the islands, to publish a proclamation declaring\r\n    that we come not to make war upon the people of the Philippines\r\n    nor upon any party or faction among them, but to protect them\r\n    in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal\r\n    and religious rights. All persons who, either by active aid or\r\n    by honest submission, co-operate with the United States in its\r\n    efforts to give effect to this beneficent purpose will receive\r\n    the reward of its support and protection. Our occupation should\r\n    be as free from severity as possible. Though the powers of the\r\n    military occupant are absolute and supreme and operate immediately\r\n    upon the political condition of the inhabitants, the municipal\r\n    laws of the conquered territory, such as affect private rights\r\n    of persons and property and provide for the punishment of crime,\r\n    are to be considered as continuing in force, so far as they are\r\n    compatible with the new order of things, until they are suspended\r\n    or superseded by the occupying belligerents; and in practice they\r\n    are not usually abrogated, but are allowed to remain in force\r\n    and to be administered by the ordinary tribunals substantially as\r\n    they were before the occupation. This enlightened practice is, so\r\n    far as possible, to be adhered to on the present occasion. * * *\r\n    The freedom of the people to pursue their accustomed occupations\r\n    will be abridged only when it may be necessary to do so.\r\n\r\n    While the rule of conduct of the American commander-in-chief will\r\n    be such as has just been defined, it will be his duty to adopt\r\n    measures of a different kind if, unfortunately, the course of the\r\n    people should render such measures indispensable to the maintenance\r\n    of law and order. He will then possess the power to replace or\r\n    expel the native officials in part or altogether, to substitute\r\n    new courts of his own constitution for those that now exist, or\r\n    to create such supplementary tribunals as may be necessary. In\r\n    the exercise of these high powers the commander must be guided\r\n    by his judgment and experience and a high sense of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile this document declares the purpose of our government to be a \"two\r\nfold purpose,\" viz., first, to make an appropriate move in the game\r\nof war, and, second, to police the Islands \"while in the possession\r\nof the United States,\" it is wholly free from inherent evidence of any\r\nintention out of harmony with the policy as to Cuba. In fact when the\r\ncity of Santiago de Cuba surrendered to our forces in July thereafter,\r\nand it became necessary to issue instructions for the guidance of the\r\nmilitary commander there, exactly the same instructions were given him,\r\n[69] verbatim et literatim. But in respect of the Cuban instructions\r\nthere was never any concealment practised or necessary because the\r\nCubans had been assured by the Teller amendment to the resolutions\r\ndeclaring war against Spain that we had no ulterior designs on their\r\ncountry, and that, as soon as peace and public order were restored,\r\nwe intended \"to leave the government and control of the island to its\r\npeople.\" The Cuban instructions were therefore frankly and promptly\r\npublished in General Orders No. 101 by the War Department, July 18,\r\n1898, five days after they were received from the President, and\r\nwere then translated into Spanish and spread broadcast over Santiago\r\nprovince without unnecessary delay. I remember poring over a Spanish\r\ncopy of General Orders 101, at Santiago de Cuba, shortly after the\r\nfall of that city, which copy was one of many already posted about\r\nthat city by direction of General Wood. The words \"the powers of the\r\nmilitary occupant are absolute and supreme and operate immediately\r\nupon the political condition of the inhabitants\" never disturbed the\r\nCuban leaders in the least, because they were read in the light of the\r\ndisclaimer contained in the declaration of war. On the other hand,\r\nthe proclamation which the military commander in the Philippines\r\nwas enjoined by his instructions to publish \"immediately upon his\r\narrival in the islands,\" which arrival occurred July 25th, was not so\r\npublished until after we had taken Manila, August 13th, and then it\r\ncopied only the glittering generalities of the instructions themselves,\r\nsuch as the part assuring the people that we had not come to make war\r\non them and that vested rights would be respected, but it carefully\r\nomitted the words about the powers of the military occupant being\r\nabsolute and supreme, because when the army arrived it found a native\r\ngovernment that had already issued its declaration of independence,\r\nwas making wonderful progress against the common enemy, and was able\r\nto put up a right good fight against us also, in case we should deny\r\nthem independence. [70]\r\n\r\nGeneral Anderson arrived in Manila Bay, June 30, 1898, with about\r\n2500 men, and when General Merritt arrived, July 25th, we had about\r\n10,000 all told, while the Filipinos had half again that many, and\r\nthere were 12,000 Spanish soldiers in Manila. General Anderson had not\r\nbeen long camped on the bayshore, under cover of the Navy's guns and\r\nin the neighborhood of Aguinaldo's headquarters, before he understood\r\nthe whole situation clearly and wrote the War Department as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since reading the President's instructions to General Merritt,\r\n    I think I should state to you that the establishment of a\r\n    provisional government on our part will probably bring us in\r\n    conflict with insurgents.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is dated July 18, 1898. [71]\r\n\r\nWhen General Anderson arrived in the islands on June 30th,\r\nthe Washington Government was still wrestling with the angel of\r\nits announced creed about \"Forcible Annexation\" being \"criminal\r\naggression,\" and Mr. McKinley had to get both that angel's shoulders on\r\nthe mat and put him out of business before he could get his own consent\r\nto giving any instructions to his generals which might sanction their\r\nkilling people for objecting to forcible annexation. Hence his early\r\nanxiety to avoid a rupture with the Filipino leaders. The first stage\r\nof this wrestling coincides in point of time with General Anderson's\r\ntenure as the ranking military officer commanding our forces in\r\nthe Philippines, which was from June 30th until the date of General\r\nMerritt's arrival, July 25th. As already made plain, the President's\r\ninstructions for the guidance of the military commander were entirely\r\nfree from any land-grabbing suggestion. On the other hand, when General\r\nAnderson left San Francisco for Manila, May 25th, there was already\r\ntalk in the United States about retaining the Islands, if they were\r\ncaptured, for he so informed Admiral Dewey in the first interview\r\nthey had after the transports which brought his command cast anchor\r\nnear our squadron in Manila Bay on the last day of June. \"I was the\r\nfirst to tell Admiral Dewey,\" says he, in the North American Review\r\nfor February, 1900, \"that there was any disposition on the part of the\r\nAmerican people to hold the Philippines, if they were captured. The\r\ncurrent opinion was setting that way when the expeditionary force\r\nleft San Francisco, but this the Admiral had no reason to surmise.\"\r\n\r\nRelegated by the circumstances to his own discretion as to how he\r\nshould act until Washington knew its mind, General Anderson's attitude\r\nin the outset represented a \"peace-at-any-price\" policy, suffused\r\nwith benevolent pride at championing the cause of the oppressed, but\r\nsecretly knowing from the beginning that it might become necessary\r\nlater to slaughter said \"oppressed,\" should they seriously object to\r\na change of masters.\r\n\r\n\"On July 1st,\" says General Anderson, in the North American Review\r\narticle above quoted, \"I called on Aguinaldo with Admiral Dewey.\" Of\r\nthe Admiral's dealings with the insurgent chief prior to this time,\r\nthe General says in this same article:\r\n\r\n\"Whether Admiral Dewey and Consuls Pratt, Wildman, and Williams did\r\nor did not give Aguinaldo assurances that a Filipino government would\r\nbe recognized, the Filipinos certainly thought so, probably inferring\r\nthis from their acts rather than from their statements.\" This last\r\nquoted passage was read to Admiral Dewey by a member of the Senate\r\nCommittee in 1902, along with other parts of the magazine article\r\ncited, and he was asked to comment on the same. He said:\r\n\r\n\"These are General Anderson's statements. They are very interesting,\r\nindeed; I am here to make my own statements.\"\r\n\r\nHe had stated that he never did specifically promise Aguinaldo\r\nindependence, and the questioner was trying to show that his acts had\r\namounted to assurances and therefore had committed the Government to\r\ngiving the Filipinos their independence. Then Senator Patterson began\r\nanother question, and had gotten as far as \"I want to know whether\r\nyour views--\" when out came this, as of a sailor-man clearing decks\r\nfor action:\r\n\r\n\"I do not like your questions a bit. I did not like them yesterday and\r\nI do not like them to-day.\" So the Admiral's feelings were respected\r\nand the question was not pressed. There is no doubt at all that in\r\nthe Philippines in the summer of 1898 the army turned the back of its\r\nhand to Aguinaldo as soon as it got there and baldly repudiated what\r\nthe navy had done in the way of befriending the Filipinos. But both\r\nhad acted under the authority of the Commander-in-Chief of the Army\r\nand Navy--the President. The Admiral's sensitiveness on the subject\r\nought to have been respected. And it was.\r\n\r\nBy the time Admiral Dewey and General Anderson decided to call on\r\n\"Don Emilio,\" the day after the General's arrival, the unexpected\r\nintimations which the latter brought, as to the Washington programme\r\nfor the Philippine revolutionists being different from that as to Cuba,\r\nhad begun to get in its work on the former. Not being a politician,\r\nthe gallant Admiral was there ready and able to carry out any orders\r\nhis government might send him, whenever the politicians should decide\r\nwhat they wanted to do. But in the absence of orders, he began to\r\ntrim his sails a bit, so as to be prepared for whatever might be the\r\npolicy. Accordingly, before he and the General started out to pay their\r\ncall on \"Don Emilio Aguinaldo y Famy, President of the Revolutionary\r\nGovernment of the Philippines and General in Chief of its Army\"--as he\r\nhad styled himself in his proclamation of June 23d,--the Admiral said,\r\n\"Do not take your sword or put on your uniform, but just put on your\r\nblouse. Do not go with any ceremony.\" And says he, in telling this, \"We\r\nwent in that way.\" [72] The reason of thus avoiding too much ceremony\r\ntoward our \"ally\" claiming to represent an existing government which\r\nhad lately declared its independence, is explained by an expression\r\nof the Admiral's concerning said Declaration of Independence itself:\r\n\"That was my idea, not taking it seriously.\" At that same hearing the\r\nAdmiral explained with much genuine feeling that from the day of the\r\nnaval battle of May 1st until the arrival of the army \"these great\r\nquestions\" were coming up constantly and he simply met them as they\r\narose by acting on his best judgment on the spot at the time. But what\r\na terrible mistake it was not to take that Declaration of Independence\r\nof June 23d, seriously, backed as it was by an army of 15,000 men\r\nflushed with victory, and under the absolute control of the author of\r\nthe Declaration! Of course the Declaration had been published to the\r\narmy. Could its author have checked them by repudiating it even if\r\nhe had wanted to? As Aguinaldo himself expressed what would happen in\r\nsuch a contingency, \"They would fail to recognize me as the interpreter\r\nof their aspirations and would punish me as a traitor, replacing me\r\nby another more careful of his own honor and dignity.\" [73]\r\n\r\nThis Dewey-Anderson call on Aguinaldo was on July 1st. Admiral Dewey\r\nnow began to foresee that the Washington programme was going to\r\nput him in an awkward position. So he began to take Aguinaldo more\r\nseriously. On July 4th, he wired Washington: \"Aguinaldo proclaimed\r\nhimself President of the Revolutionary Republic on July 1st.\" [74]\r\nIt was on July 7th that Admiral Dewey captured 1300 armed Spanish\r\nprisoners, the garrison of Isla la Grande, off Olongapo, and turned\r\nthem over to the forces of the Aguinaldo government because he had\r\nno way to keep them. [75] Was not that taking that government a\r\nbit seriously? How wholly unauthorized by the facts was this of \"not\r\ntaking it seriously,\" on the part of \"The Liberator of the Filipinos,\"\r\n[76] the immortal victor of Manila Bay, who two months before had\r\ntaught the nation the magnitude of its power for good, in a cause as\r\nrighteous as the crusades of old, and more sensible!\r\n\r\nBut to return to General Anderson's account in the North American\r\nReview of his call, with Admiral Dewey, on the insurgent chief: \"He\r\nasked me at once whether the 'United States of the North' either had,\r\nor would recognize his government. I am not quite sure as to the form\r\nof the question, whether it was 'had' or 'would'? In either form it was\r\nembarrassing.\" General Anderson then tells of Aguinaldo's returning\r\nhis call: \"A few days thereafter he made an official call, coming\r\nwith cabinet, staff, and band. He asked if we, the North Americans,\r\nas he called us, intended to hold the Philippines as dependencies. I\r\nsaid I could not answer that, but that in 122 years we had established\r\nno colonies. He then made this remarkable statement: 'I have studied\r\nattentively the Constitution of the United States, and I find in it no\r\nauthority for colonies, and I have no fear.'\" General Anderson adds:\r\n\"It may seem that my answer was evasive, but I was at the time trying\r\nto contract with the Filipinos for horses, fuel, and forage.\"\r\n\r\nWhile this history must not lapse into an almanac, it may not be\r\namiss to follow these early stages of this matter through a few more\r\nsuccessive dates, because the history of that period was all indelibly\r\nbranded into Filipino memory shortly afterward with the red-hot iron\r\nof war.\r\n\r\nJuly 4th, General Anderson writes the Filipino candidate for\r\nIndependence inviting him to \"co-operate with us in military operations\r\nagainst the Spanish forces.\" [77] This was written not to arrange\r\nany plan of co-operation but in order to get room about Cavite as a\r\nmilitary base without a row. In his North American Review article\r\nGeneral Anderson says that on that same day, the Fourth of July,\r\nAguinaldo was invited to witness a parade and review \"in honor of\r\nour national holiday.\" \"He did not come,\" says the article, \"because\r\nhe was not invited as President but as General Aguinaldo.\" An odd\r\nsituation, was it not? Here was a man claiming to be President of a\r\nnewly established republic based on the principles set forth in our\r\nDeclaration of Independence, which republic had just issued a like\r\nDeclaration, and he was invited to come and hear our declaration read,\r\nand declined because we would not recognize his right to assert the\r\nsame truths. On subsequent anniversaries of the day in the Philippines\r\nit was deemed wise simply to prohibit the reading of our Declaration\r\nbefore gatherings of the Filipino people. It saved discussion.\r\n\r\nJuly 6th, General Anderson writes telling Aguinaldo that he is\r\nexpecting more troops soon and therefore \"I would like to have your\r\nexcellency's advice and co-operation.\" [78]\r\n\r\nJuly 9th, General Anderson writes the War Department that Aguinaldo\r\ntells him he has about 15,000 fighting men, 11,000 armed with guns,\r\nand some 4000 prisoners, [79] and adds: \"When we first landed he\r\nseemed very suspicious, and not at all friendly but I have now come\r\nto a better understanding with him and he is much more friendly and\r\nseems willing to co-operate.\"\r\n\r\nJuly 13th, we find Admiral Dewey also still in a co-operative mood. On\r\nthat day he cables the Navy Department of the capture of the 1,300\r\nprisoners on July 7th, mentioned above, which capture was made, it\r\nappears, because Aguinaldo complained to him that a German war-ship\r\nwas interfering with his operations, [80] the prisoners being at once\r\nturned over to Aguinaldo, as stated above.\r\n\r\nJuly 18th, is the date of the letter to the War Department\r\nin which General Anderson states that the establishment of a\r\nprovisional government by us will probably mean a conflict with the\r\ninsurgents. This was equivalent to saying that they will probably be\r\nready to fight whenever we assert the \"absolute and supreme\" authority\r\nthat the President's instructions had directed to be asserted by the\r\narmy as soon as it should arrive in the Philippines. Yet in the fall\r\nof 1899, President McKinley said he \"never dreamed\" that Aguinaldo's\r\n\"little band\" would oppose our rule to the extent of war against it. It\r\nwould have been more accurate if the martyred Christian gentleman\r\nwho used those words had said he \"always hoped\" they would not,\r\ninstead of \"never dreamed\" they would. This letter of July 18th,\r\ninforms the Department:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Aguinaldo has declared himself dictator and self-appointed\r\n    president. He has declared martial law and promulgated a minute\r\n    method of procedure under it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJuly 19th, General Anderson sends Major (now Major-General) J. F. Bell,\r\nto Aguinaldo, and asks of him a number of favors, such as any\r\nsoldier may properly ask of an ally, for example, permission to see\r\nhis military maps, etc., and that Aguinaldo \"place at his [Bell's]\r\ndisposal any information you may have on the above subjects, and also\r\ngive him [Bell] a letter or pass addressed to your subordinates which\r\nwill authorize them to furnish him any information they can * * *\r\nand to facilitate his passage along the lines, upon a reconnaissance\r\naround Manila, on which I propose to send him.\" [81] All of which\r\nAguinaldo did.\r\n\r\nMilitary training is very keen on honor. Talk about what the French\r\ncall foi d'officier,--the \"word of an officer\"! Did ever a letter from\r\none soldier to another more completely commit the faith and honor of\r\nhis government, to recognition of the existence of an alliance? \"In\r\n122 years we have established no colonies,\" he had told Aguinaldo. \"It\r\nlooks like we are about to go into the colonizing business,\" he had,\r\nin effect, said to Admiral Dewey, about the same time.\r\n\r\nJuly 21st, General Anderson writes the Adjutant-General of the army\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since I last wrote, Aguinaldo has put in operation an elaborate\r\n    system of military government. * * * It may seem strange that I\r\n    have made no formal protest against his proclamation as dictator,\r\n    his declaration of martial law, etc. I wrote such a protest but\r\n    did not publish it at Admiral Dewey's request. [82]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he wrote this letter, General Anderson was evidently beginning\r\nto have some compunctions about the trouble he now saw ahead. He was\r\na veteran of the Civil War, whose gallantry had then been proven on\r\nmany a field against an enemy compared with whom these people would\r\nbe a picnic. But things did not look to the grim old hero like there\r\nwas going to be a square deal. So he put this in the letter:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I submit, with all deference, that we have heretofore underrated\r\n    the natives. They are not ignorant savage tribes, but have\r\n    a civilization of their own, and although insignificant in\r\n    appearance are fierce fighters and for a tropical people they are\r\n    industrious. A small detail of natives will do more work than a\r\n    regiment of volunteers.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course, this slam at \"volunteers\" was a bit rough. But the\r\nbattle-scarred veteran's sense of fair play was getting on his\r\nnerves. He foresaw the coming conflict, and though he did not shirk it,\r\nhe did not relish it. He understood the \"game,\" and it seemed to him\r\nthe cards were stacked, to meet the necessity of demonstrating that\r\nforcible annexation, instead of being criminal aggression, was merely\r\nTrade Expansion, and that his government was right then irrevocably\r\ncommitting itself, without any knowledge of, or acquaintance with,\r\nthe Filipinos, to the assumption that they were incapable of running\r\na government of their own.\r\n\r\nThe next day, July 22d, General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo a letter\r\nadvising him that he was without orders as yet concerning the question\r\nof recognizing his government. But that this letter was neither a\r\nprotest nor in the nature of a protest, is evident from its text:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I observe that Your Excellency has announced yourself dictator\r\n    and proclaimed martial law. As I am here simply in a military\r\n    capacity, I have no authority to recognize such an assumption. I\r\n    have no orders from my government on the subject. [83]\r\n\r\n\r\nYet General Anderson's letter to the Adjutant-General of the army\r\nof July 18th [84] uses the words \"since reading the President's\r\ninstructions to General Merritt,\" etc., showing that he had a copy\r\nof them; and those instructions order and direct (see ante) that\r\nas soon as the commanding general of the American troops arrives\r\nhe is to let the Filipinos know that \"the powers of the military\r\noccupant are absolute and supreme and immediately operate upon the\r\npolitical condition of the inhabitants.\" A charitable view of the\r\nmatter would be that, technically, those were Merritt's orders,\r\nnot Anderson's. But the whole scheme was to conceal the intention\r\nto assume supreme authority and keep Aguinaldo quiet \"until,\" as\r\nGeneral Merritt afterwards expressed it in his report, \"I should be\r\nin possession of the city of Manila, * * * as I would not until then\r\nbe in a position to * * * enforce my authority, in the event that his\r\n[Aguinaldo's] pretensions should clash with my designs.\" [85]\r\n\r\nThe same day that General Anderson wrote Aguinaldo his billet doux\r\nabout the dictatorship, viz., July 22d, he cabled Washington a much\r\nfranker and more serious message; which read: \"Aguinaldo declares\r\ndictatorship and martial law over all islands. The people expect\r\nindependence.\" The very next day, July 23d, he wrote Aguinaldo asking\r\nhis assistance in getting five hundred horses, and fifty oxen and\r\nox-carts, and manifesting considerable impatience that he had not\r\nalready complied with a similar request previously made \"as it was\r\nto fight in the cause of your people.\" [86] The following day, July\r\n24th, replying to General Anderson's letter of the 22d wherein General\r\nAnderson had advised him that he was as yet without orders concerning\r\nthe question of recognizing his government, Aguinaldo wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is true that my government has not been acknowledged by any\r\n    of the foreign powers, but we expected that the great North\r\n    American nation, which had struggled first for its independence,\r\n    and afterwards for the abolition of slavery, and is now actually\r\n    struggling for the independence of Cuba, would look upon it with\r\n    greater benevolence than any other nation. [87]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat cablegram of July 22d, above quoted, in which the commanding\r\ngeneral of our forces in the Philippines advises the Washington\r\ngovernment, \"The people expect independence,\" is the hardest thing in\r\nthe published archives of our government covering that momentous period\r\nfor those who love the memory of Mr. McKinley to get around. [88] After\r\nthe war with the Filipinos broke out Mr. McKinley said repeatedly in\r\npublic speeches, \"I never dreamed they would turn against us.\" You do\r\nnot find the Anderson cablegram of July 22d in the published report of\r\nthe War Department covering the period under consideration. General\r\nAnderson addressed it to the Secretary of War and signed it, and,\r\nprobably for lack of army cable facilities, got Admiral Dewey to send\r\nit to the Secretary of the Navy for transmission to the Secretary of\r\nWar. [89] Certain it must be that at some Cabinet meeting on or after\r\nJuly 22, 1898, either the Secretary of the Navy or the Secretary of War\r\nread in the hearing of the President and the rest of his advisers that\r\nmessage from General Anderson, \"The people expect independence.\" The\r\nobject here is not to inveigh against Mr. McKinley. It is to show\r\nthat, as Gibbon told us long ago, in speaking of the discontent of\r\nfar distant possessions and the lack of hold of the possessor on the\r\naffections of the inhabitants thereof, \"the cry of remote distress\r\nis ever faintly heard.\" The average American to-day, if told the\r\nFilipinos want independence, will give the statement about the same\r\nconsideration Mr. McKinley did then, and if told that the desire\r\namong them for a government of their people by their people for their\r\npeople has not been diminished since the late war by tariff taxation\r\nwithout representation, and the steady development of race prejudice\r\nbetween the dominant alien race and the subject one, he will begin\r\nto realize by personal experience how faintly the uttered longings\r\nof a whole people may fall on distant ears.\r\n\r\nWe saw above that in a letter written July 21st, the day before the\r\ntelegram about the \"people expect independence,\" which letter must\r\nhave reached Washington within thirty days, General Anderson not\r\nonly notified Washington all about Aguinaldo's government and its\r\npretensions, but stated that at the request of Admiral Dewey he had\r\nmade no protest against it. [90] Yet straight on through the period\r\nof General Merritt's sojourn in the Islands, which began July 25th,\r\nand terminated August 29th, we find no protest ordered by Washington,\r\nand we further find the purpose of the President as announced in\r\nthe instructions to Merritt, \"The powers of the military occupant\r\nare absolute and supreme\" throughout the Islands, not only not\r\ncommunicated to the Filipino people, but deliberately suppressed\r\nfrom the proclamation published by General Merritt pursuant to those\r\ninstructions. [91]\r\n\r\nComments and conclusions are usually impertinent and unwelcome save as\r\nmere addenda to facts, but in the light of the facts derivable from\r\nour own official records, is it any wonder that General Anderson,\r\na gallant veteran of the Civil War, and perhaps the most conspicuous\r\nfigure of the early fighting in the Philippines, delivered an address\r\nsome time after he came back home before the Oregon Commandery of\r\nthe Loyal Legion of the United States [92] on the subject, \"Should\r\nrepublics have colonies?\" and answered the question emphatically \"No!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nMERRITT AND AGUINALDO\r\n\r\n                    There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.\r\n\r\n                                           Julius Caesar, Act IV., Sc. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-General Wesley Merritt's account of the operations of the troops\r\nunder his command in the First Expedition to the Philippines may be\r\nfound in volume i., part 2, War Department Report for 1898. He left\r\nSan Francisco accompanied by his staff, June 29, 1898, arrived at\r\nCavite, Manila Bay, July 25th, received the surrender of the city of\r\nManila August 13th, and sailed thence August 30th, in obedience to\r\norders from Washington to proceed without unnecessary delay to Paris,\r\nFrance, for conference with the Peace Commissioners. According to\r\nGeneral Merritt's report, about the time he arrived Aguinaldo had\r\nsome 12,000 men under arms, with plenty of ammunition, and a number\r\nof field-pieces. The late lamented Frank D. Millet has preserved for\r\nus, in his Expedition to the Philippines, some valuable and intimate\r\nstudies of this army of Filipino besiegers whom our troops found\r\nbusily at work when they arrived in the Islands:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was an interesting sight at Camp Dewey to see the insurgents\r\n    strolling to and from the front. Pretty much all day long they\r\n    were coming and going, never in military formation, but singly,\r\n    and in small groups, perfectly clean and tidy in dress, often\r\n    accompanied by their wives and children, and all chatting as\r\n    merrily as if they were going off on a pigeon shoot. The men who\r\n    sold fish and vegetables in camp in the morning would be seen\r\n    every day or two dressed in holiday garments, with rifle and\r\n    cartridge boxes, strolling off to take their turn at the Spaniards.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader will readily understand that there were many times as many\r\nvolunteers as guns. Mr. Millet continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When they had been at the front twenty-four hours they were\r\n    relieved and returned home for a rest. They generally passed\r\n    their rifles and equipments on to another man and thus a limited\r\n    number of weapons served to arm a great many besiegers. They had\r\n    no distinctive uniform, the only badge of service being a red\r\n    and blue cockade with a white triangle bearing the Malay symbol\r\n    of the sun and three stars, and sometimes a red and blue band\r\n    pinned diagonally across the lower part of the left sleeve. * * *\r\n    Many of them * * * had belonged to the native volunteer force.\r\n    * * * The recruits were soon hammered into shape by the veterans\r\n    of the rank and file. * * * Their men were perfectly obedient\r\n    to orders * * * and they made the most devoted soldiers. There\r\n    was no visible Commissary or Quartermaster's Departments, but\r\n    the insurgent force was always supplied with food and ammunition\r\n    and there was no lack of transportation. The food issued at the\r\n    front was mostly rice brought up in carromatas to within a few\r\n    hundred yards of the trenches, when it was cooked by the women.\r\n    * * * Each man had a double handful of rice, sometimes enriched\r\n    by a small proportion of meat and fish, which was served him in\r\n    a square of plantain leaf. Thus he was unencumbered with a plate\r\n    or knife or fork and threw away his primitive but excellent dish\r\n    when he had \"licked the platter clean.\" It was noticeable that\r\n    the insurgents carried no water bottles nor haversacks, and no\r\n    equipments indeed, but cartridge boxes. They did not seem to be\r\n    worried by thirst like our men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Although insignificant in appearance, they are fierce fighters,\" wrote\r\nGeneral Anderson to the Adjutant-General of the army in July. [93]\r\n\r\nGeneral Merritt states in his report that Aguinaldo had \"proclaimed an\r\nindependent government, republican in form, with himself as President,\r\nand at the time of my arrival in the Islands the entire edifice\r\nof executive and legislative departments had been accomplished, at\r\nleast on paper.\" [94] Of course at that time we were still officially\r\ndeclining to take Filipino aspirations for independence seriously,\r\nand preferred to treat Aguinaldo's government as purely a matter of\r\nstationery. As a matter of fact, an exhaustive examination of the\r\nofficial documents of that period, made with a view of ascertaining\r\njust how much of that Aguinaldo government of 1898 was stationery\r\nfiction and how much was stable fact, has absolutely surprised one\r\nman who was out there from 1899 to 1905 (the writer), and I have no\r\ndoubt will be interesting, as mere matter of political necrology,\r\nto any American who was there \"in the days of the empire\" as the\r\n\"ninety-niners\" called it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1899, Mr. McKinley sent out the Commission of\r\nwhich President Schurman of Cornell University was Chairman, to try to\r\nstop the war. They bent themselves to the task in a spirit as kindly\r\nas that in which we know Mr. McKinley himself would have acted. They\r\nfailed because the war was already on and the Filipinos were bent on\r\nfighting for independence to the bitter end. But they learned a good\r\ndeal about the facts of the earlier situation. Speaking of these in\r\ntheir report to the President [95] with especial reference to the\r\nperiod beginning with Aguinaldo's landing at Cavite in May, after\r\ndescribing how the Filipino successes in battle with the Spaniards\r\nfinally resulted in all of them being driven into Manila, where they\r\nremained hemmed in, they say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    While the Spanish troops now remained quietly in Manila, the\r\n    Filipino forces made themselves masters of the entire island\r\n    except that city.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For three and one half months,\" says General Otis in describing\r\nthe facts of this same situation a year later, \"the insurgents on\r\nland had kept Manila tightly bottled [meaning while Admiral Dewey\r\nhad been blockading the place by water] * * * and food supplies were\r\nexhausted.\" [96] \"We had Manila and Cavite. The rest of the island\r\nwas held not by the Spanish but by the Filipinos,\" said General\r\nAnderson, in the North American Review for February, 1900. \"It is a\r\nfact that they were in possession, they had gotten pretty much the\r\nwhole thing except Manila,\" said Admiral Dewey to the Senate Committee\r\nin 1902. [97]\r\n\r\nGeneral Merritt took Manila August 13th, and sailed away for Paris\r\nAugust 31st, and only a week after that General Otis wired Washington\r\n(under date of September 7th) from Manila: \"Insurgents have captured\r\nall Spanish garrisons in island [of Luzon] and control affairs outside\r\nof Cavite and this city.\" [98]\r\n\r\nThe recruiting by Aguinaldo of an army of 40,000 men with guns\r\nwithin one hundred days after his little \"Return from Elba\"--\"15,000\r\nfighting men, 11,000 of them armed with guns,\" in fifty days, [99]\r\nwhich number had swelled to nearly 40,000 men with guns in another\r\nfifty days (by August 29th) [100]--is no more remarkable than his\r\nprogress in organizing his government and making its grip on the\r\nwhole island of Luzon effective in a short space of time.\r\n\r\nAs all Americans who know the Filipinos know how fond they are of what\r\ngovernment offices call \"paper work,\" and how their escribientes [101]\r\ncan work like bees in drafting documents, it might be easy to ignore\r\nAguinaldo's various proclamations, already hereinbefore noticed in\r\nChapter II., as representing merely \"a government on paper,\" were\r\nthere no other proof. But among the insurgent captured papers we\r\nfound long afterward, there is a document containing the minutes of\r\na convention of the insurrecto presidentes from all the pueblos of\r\nfifteen different provinces, on August 6, 1898, which throws a flood\r\nof light on the subject now under consideration. [102] This convention\r\nwas held at Bacoor, then Aguinaldo's headquarters, a little town on\r\nthe bay shore between Manila and Cavite. The minutes of the convention\r\nrecite that its members had been previously chosen as presidentes\r\nof their respective pueblos in the manner prescribed by previous\r\ndecrees issued by Aguinaldo (already noticed), and that thereafter\r\nthey had taken the oath of office before Aguinaldo as President of the\r\ngovernment, etc. They then declare that the Filipino people whom they\r\nspeak for are \"not ambitious for power, nor honors, nor riches, aside\r\nfrom the rational aspirations for a free and independent life,\" and\r\n\"proclaim solemnly, in the face of the whole world, the Independence\r\nof the Philippines.\" They also re-affirm allegiance to Aguinaldo as\r\nPresident of the government and request him to seek recognition of it\r\nat the hands of the Powers, \"because,\" says the paper, \"to no one is it\r\npermitted to * * * stifle the legitimate aspirations of a people\"--as\r\nif Europe cared a rap what we did to them except in the way of regret\r\nthat it did not have a finger in the pie. However, they were not only\r\napprehensive, on the one hand, lest we might be tempted to take their\r\ncountry away from Spain for ourselves, but also, on the other hand,\r\nlest we might in the wind-up decide to leave them to Spain at the end\r\nof the war. That this last was not an idle fear is shown by the fact\r\nthat during the deliberations of the Paris Peace Commission, Judge\r\nGray urged, in behalf of his contention against taking the islands\r\nat all, that if Dewey had sunk the Spanish fleet off Cadiz, instead\r\nof in Manila Bay, and the Carlists had incidentally helped us about\r\nthat time, we would have been under no resulting obligation \"to stay\r\nby them at the conclusion of the war.\" [103] When the presidentes in\r\nconvention assembled as aforesaid got through with their whereases and\r\nresolutions they presented them to His Excellency the President of the\r\nRepublic, Aguinaldo, who then issued a proclamation which recited,\r\namong other things: \"In these provinces [the fifteen represented\r\nin the convention] complete order and perfect tranquillity reign,\r\nadministered by the authorities elected\" [104] according to his\r\nprevious decrees as Dictator, which decrees have already been placed\r\nbefore the reader. The proclamation claims that the new government\r\nhas 9,000 prisoners of war and 30,000 combatants. The former claim\r\nno one having any acquaintance with those times and conditions\r\nwill question for a moment. As to the 30,000 combatants, if he had\r\n11,000 men armed with guns on July 9th and 40,000 on August 29th,\r\nwhy not 30,000 on August 6th? Of course, men without guns, bolo men,\r\ndo not count for much in a serious connection like this now being\r\nconsidered. In November, 1899, at San Jose, in Nueva Ecija province,\r\nI heard General Lawton tell Colonel Jack Hayes to disarm and turn\r\nloose 175 bolo men the colonel had just captured and was lining up on\r\nthe public square as we rode into the town. But we are considering how\r\nmuch of a government the Filipinos had in 1898, because the answer is\r\npertinent to what sort of a government they could run if permitted now\r\nor at any time in the future; and, physical force being the ultimate\r\nbasis of stability in all government, when we come to estimate how much\r\nof an army they had when their government was claiming recognition as a\r\nlegitimate living thing, we must remember that \"It was just a question\r\nof arming them. They could have had the whole population.\" [105]\r\n\r\nNow the great significant fact about this Bacoor convention of\r\npresidentes of August 6th--a week before Manila surrendered to our\r\nforces--is that in it more than half the population of the island of\r\nLuzon was represented. The total population of the Philippines is\r\nabout 7,600,000, [106] and, of these, one-half, or 3,800,000 [107]\r\nlive on Luzon. The other islands may be said to dangle from Luzon\r\nlike the tail of a kite. Taking the tables of the American census\r\nof the Philippines of 1903 (vol. ii., p. 123), as a basis on which\r\nto judge what Aguinaldo's claims of August 6th amounted to if true,\r\nthe population of the provinces thus duly incorporated into the new\r\ngovernment and in working order on that date, was, in round numbers,\r\nabout as follows: South of Manila:--Cavite, 135,000; Batangas, 260,000;\r\nLaguna, 150,000; Tayabas, 150,000; North of Manila:--Bulacan, 225,000;\r\nPampamga, 225,000; Nueva Ecija, 135,000; Tarlac, 135,000; Pangasinan,\r\n400,000; Union, 140,000; Bataan, 45,000; Zambales, 105,000. This\r\nrepresents a total of more than 2,000,000 of people.\r\n\r\nBut Aguinaldo's claims of August 6th are not the only evidence as to\r\nthe political status of the provinces of Luzon in August, 1898. Toward\r\nthe end of that month, Maj. J. F. Bell, Chief of General Merritt's\r\nBureau of Military Information, made a report on the situation as\r\nit stood August 29th, the report being made after most careful\r\ninvestigation, and intended as a summary of the then situation\r\naccording to the most reliable information obtainable, in order that\r\nGeneral Merritt might know, as far as practicable, what he would be\r\n\"up against\" in the event of trouble with the insurgents. [108]\r\n\r\nThis report not only corroborates Aguinaldo's claims of August 6th,\r\nbut it also concedes to the Aguinaldo people eight other important\r\nprovinces--four south of the Pasig River with a total population of\r\nabout 630,000, [109] the only four of southern Luzon not included in\r\nAguinaldo's claim of August 6th, thus conceding him practically all\r\nof Luzon south of the Pasig; and it furthermore concedes him four\r\ngreat provinces of northern Luzon with a total population of nearly\r\n600,000. [110] General Bell states that these last are \"still in the\r\npossession of the Spanish,\" but practically certain to be with the\r\ninsurgents in the very near future. \"Insurgents have been dispatched\r\nto attack the Spanish in these provinces,\" says the Bell report.\r\n\r\nIn this same report Major Bell said: \"There is not a particle of doubt\r\nbut what Aguinaldo and his leaders will resist any attempt of any\r\ngovernment to reorganize a colonial government here.\" [111] When the\r\ninsurgent government was finally dislodged from its last capital and\r\nAguinaldo became a fugitive hotly pursued by our troops, he started\r\nfor the mountains of northern Luzon, passing through provinces he\r\nhad never visited before. The diary of one of his staff officers,\r\nMajor Villa, in describing a brief stop they made in a town en route\r\n(Aringay, in Union province) says: \"After the honorable President\r\nhad urged them [the townspeople] to be patriotic, we continued the\r\nmarch.\" [112] They certainly did \"continue the march.\" The Maccabebe\r\nscouts, of which the writer commanded a company at the time, took\r\nthe town a few hours later, Aguinaldo's rear-guard retiring after\r\na brief resistance, following which we found, among the dead in the\r\ntrenches, a major other than Villa. Certainly, to read this little\r\nextract from the diary of Aguinaldo's retreat is to feel the pulse\r\nof northern Luzon as to its loyalty to the revolution at that time,\r\nand is corroborative of these claims of Aguinaldo made in August,\r\n1898, supplemented, as we have seen them, by General Bell's appraisal.\r\n\r\nAs to the political conditions which prevailed in southern Luzon,\r\nparticularly in the Camarines, in August and the fall of 1898,\r\ninformation derived from one who was there then would seem appropriate\r\nhere. Major Blanton Winship, Judge Advocate's Corps, U. S. A., Major\r\nArchibald W. Butt, the late lamented military aide to President Taft,\r\nand the writer, lived together in Manila, in 1900, at the house of a\r\nSpanish physician, a Dr. Lopez, who had been a \"prisoner\" at Nueva\r\nCaceres, a town situated in one of the provinces of southern Luzon\r\n(Camarines) in the fall of 1898. Dr. Lopez had a large family. They had\r\nalso been \"prisoners\" down there. No evil befell them at the hands of\r\ntheir \"captors.\" They had the freedom of the town they were in. They\r\nhad good reason to be pretty well scared as to what the insurgents\r\nmight do to them. But they were never maltreated. The main impression\r\nwe got from Dr. Lopez and his family was that the political grip of\r\nthe Aguinaldo government on southern Luzon was complete during the\r\ntime they were \"prisoners\" there. If anybody doubts the absoluteness\r\nof the grip of the Revolutionary government on the situation in the\r\nprovinces which were represented at the Bacoor convention of August 6,\r\n1898, above mentioned, when the Filipino Declaration of Independence\r\nwas signed and proclaimed, let him ask any American who had a part\r\nin putting down the Philippine insurrection what a presidente, an\r\ninsurrecto presidente, in a Filipino town, was in 1899 and 1900. He\r\nwas \"the whole thing.\" Even to-day the presidente of a pueblo is as\r\nabsolute boss of his town as Charles F. Murphy is of Tammany Hall. And\r\na town or pueblo in the Philippines is more than an area covered\r\nby more or less contiguous buildings and grounds. It is more like a\r\ntownship in Massachusetts. So that when you account governmentally for\r\nthe pueblos of a given province, you account for every square foot of\r\nthat province and for every man in it. For several years before our war\r\nwith Spain, nearly every Filipino of any education and spirit in the\r\narchipelago belonged to the secret revolutionary society known as the\r\nKatipunan. This had its organization in every town when Dewey sank the\r\nSpanish fleet and landed Aguinaldo at Cavite. The rest may be imagined.\r\n\r\nBy September, 1898, Aguinaldo was absolute master of the whole of\r\nLuzon. Before the Treaty of Paris was signed (December 10, 1898), in\r\nfact while Judge Gray of the Peace Commission was cabling President\r\nMcKinley that not to leave the government of the Philippines to the\r\npeople thereof \"would be to make a mockery of instructions,\" Aguinaldo\r\nhad become equally absolute master of the situation throughout the\r\nrest of the archipelago outside of Manila.\r\n\r\nToward the end of July, 1898, our Manila Consul, Mr. Williams, who\r\nwas one of our consular triumvirate of would-be Warwicks, or \"original\r\nAguinaldo men,\" of 1898, used to have nice talks with Aguinaldo about\r\nthe lion and the lamb lying down together without the lion eating the\r\nlamb, and in one instance, at least, he goes so far as to represent\r\nAguinaldo as willing to some such arrangement--e. g., annexation, or\r\nsome vague scheme of dependence. But whenever we hear from Aguinaldo\r\nover his own signature, we hear him saying whatever means in Tagalo\r\n\"Timeo Danaos et dona ferentes.\" For instance, at page 15, of Senate\r\nDocument 208, he writes Williams, under date of August 1st, with\r\nfine courtesy:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I congratulate you with all sincerity on the acuteness and\r\n    ingenuity which you have displayed in painting in an admirable\r\n    manner the benefits which, especially for me and my leaders, and\r\n    in general for all my compatriots, would be secured by the union of\r\n    these islands with the United States of America. Ah! that picture,\r\n    so happy and so finished * * * This is not saying that I am not\r\n    of your opinion * * * You say all this and yet more will result\r\n    from annexing ourselves to your people * * * You are my friend\r\n    and the friend of the Filipinos and have said it. But why should\r\n    we say it? Will my people believe it? * * * I have done what they\r\n    desire, establishing a government * * * not only because it was my\r\n    duty, but also because had I acted in any other manner they would\r\n    fail to recognize me as the interpreter of their aspirations,\r\n    and would punish me as a traitor, replacing me by another more\r\n    careful of his own honor and dignity.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that we know what was in the Filipino mind when General Merritt\r\narrived in the Philippines, let us see what was in the American\r\nmilitary mind out there at the same time. Says General Merritt:\r\n\"General Aguinaldo did not visit me on my arrival nor offer his\r\nservices as a subordinate leader.\" We trust the reason of this\r\nat once suggests itself from what has preceded, including General\r\nAnderson's dealings with the insurgent chief. The latter wanted some\r\nunderstanding as to what the intentions of our government were, and\r\nwhat was to be the programme afterward, should he and his countrymen\r\nassist in the little fighting that now remained necessary to complete\r\nthe taking of Manila. Those intentions were precisely what Merritt\r\nwas determined to conceal. \"As my instructions from the President\r\nfully contemplated the occupation of the Islands by the American\r\nland forces, and stated that 'the powers of the military occupant\r\nare absolute and supreme and immediately operate upon the political\r\ncondition of the inhabitants,' I did not consider it wise to hold any\r\ndirect communication with the insurgent leader until I should be in\r\npossession of the city of Manila.\" [113]\r\n\r\nOn one occasion General Merritt passed through the village of Bacoor\r\nwhere Aguinaldo had his headquarters, but, says Mr. Millet [114]\r\nin mentioning this, \"They never met.\" After the taking of the city,\r\nGeneral Merritt remembered that with some 13,000 Spanish prisoners\r\nto guard, and a city of 300,000 people, all but a sprinkling of whom\r\nwere in sympathy with the insurgent cause, on his hands, and an army\r\nof at least 14,000 insurgents--probably far more than that--clamoring\r\nwithout the gates of that city, and only 10,000 men of his own with\r\nwhom to handle such a situation, frankness was out of the question,\r\nin view of his orders from the President. [115] Therefore, on the day\r\nafter the city surrendered, General Merritt issued a proclamation,\r\ncopying [116] verbatim from Mr. McKinley's instructions (ante)\r\nsuch innocuous milk-and-water passages as the one which assured the\r\npeople that our government \"has not come to wage war upon them * * *\r\nbut to protect them in their homes, in their employments, and in their\r\npersonal and religious rights; all persons who, by active aid or honest\r\nsubmission, co-operate with the United States * * * will receive the\r\nreward of its support and protection.\" But he carefully omitted the\r\nwords quoted above about the powers of the military occupant being\r\nabsolute and supreme, \"lest his [Aguinaldo's] pretensions,\" to use\r\nGeneral Merritt's expression, \"should clash with my designs.\" \"For\r\nthese reasons,\" says General Merritt (p. 40), \"the preparations for\r\nthe attack on the city were * * * conducted without reference to the\r\nsituation of the insurgent forces.\"\r\n\r\nHere General Merritt is speaking frankly but not accurately. He means\r\nhe made his preparations without any more reference to the situation\r\nof the insurgent forces than he could help. As a matter of fact,\r\ntheir situation bothered him a good deal. They were in the way. For\r\ninstance, there was a whole brigade of them at one point between\r\nour people and Manila. \"This,\" says General Merritt (p. 41), \"was\r\novercome by instructions to General Greene to arrange if possible\r\nwith the insurgent brigade commander in his immediate vicinity to\r\nmove to the right and allow the American forces unobstructed control\r\nof the roads in their immediate front. No objection was made,\"\r\netc. That reads very well--that about \"arrange if possible,\" \"no\r\nobjection was made,\" etc.,--does it not? Nothing there through which\r\n\"the lustre and the moral strength\" of the motives that prompted the\r\nSpanish war might be \"dimmed by ulterior designs which might tempt\r\nus,\" [117] is there? It was stated above that General Merritt was\r\nspeaking frankly in this report. He was. He probably did not know how\r\nGeneral Greene carried out the order to \"arrange if possible with the\r\ninsurgent brigadier-commander.\" But it so happened that there was a\r\nnewspaper correspondent along with General Greene who has since told\r\nus. This gentleman was Mr. Frank D. Millet, from whom we have already\r\nabove quoted, the correspondent of the London Times and of Harper's\r\nWeekly. General Greene had known him years before in the campaigns of\r\nthe Turco-Russian war. Mr. Millet had been a war correspondent in those\r\ncampaigns also, and General Greene was there taking observations. So\r\nthat in the operations against Manila, Mr. Millet, being an old friend\r\nof General Greene's, known to be a handy man to have around in a close\r\nplace, was acting as a civilian volunteer aide to the general. [118]\r\nHere is Mr. Millet's account of what happened, taken from his book,\r\nThe Expedition to the Philippines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the afternoon of the 28th [of July, 1898], General Greene\r\n    received a verbal message from General Merritt suggesting that\r\n    he juggle the insurgents out of part of their lines, always on\r\n    his own responsibility, and without committing in any way the\r\n    commanding general to any recognition of the native leaders\r\n    or opening up the prospect of an alliance. This General Greene\r\n    accomplished very cleverly.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Millet then goes on to tell how General Greene persuaded one\r\nof Aguinaldo's generals (Noriel) to evacuate certain trenches so he\r\n(Greene) could occupy them, \"with a condition attached that General\r\nGreene must give a written receipt for the entrenchments.\" This\r\ncondition, Mr. Millet says, was imposed by \"the astute leader\"\r\n(Aguinaldo). General Greene's \"cleverness\" consisted in purposely\r\nfailing and omitting to give the receipt, which Mr. Millet says\r\n\"looked very much like a bargain concluded over a signature, and was\r\na little more formal than General Greene thought advisable.\" The key\r\nto this sorry business may be found in the first paragraph of General\r\nMerritt's instructions to all his generals at the time:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No rupture with insurgents. This is imperative. Can ask insurgent\r\n    generals or Aguinaldo for permission to occupy trenches, but if\r\n    refused not to use force. [119]\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I am quite unable to explain,\" says Mr. Millet (p. 61), \"why we\r\ndid not in the very beginning make them understand that we were\r\nmasters of the situation, and that they must come strictly under our\r\nauthority.\" The obvious reason was that a war of conquest to subjugate\r\na remote people struggling to be free from the yoke of alien domination\r\nwas sure to be more or less unpopular with many of the sovereign\r\nvoters of a republic, and more or less dangerous therefore, like all\r\nunpopular wars, to the tenure of office of the party in power. So that\r\nin entering upon a war for conquest, a republic must \"play politics,\"\r\nusing the military arm of the government for the twofold purpose of\r\ncrushing opposition and proving that there is none.\r\n\r\nThe maxim which makes all fair in war often covers a multitude of\r\nsins. But let us turn for a moment from strategy to principle, and\r\nsee what two other distinguished American war correspondents were\r\nthinking and saying about the same time. Writing to Harper's Weekly\r\nfrom Cavite, under date of July 16th, concerning the work of the\r\nFilipinos during the eight weeks before that, Mr. O. K. Davis said:\r\n\"The insurgents have driven them [the Spaniards] back over twenty\r\nmiles of country practically impassable for our men. * * * Aguinaldo\r\nhas saved our troops a lot of desperately hard campaigning * * *. The\r\ninsurgent works extend clear around Manila, and the Spaniards are\r\ncompletely hemmed in. There is no hope for them but surrender.\" Writing\r\nto the same paper under date of August 6th, Mr. John F. Bass says:\r\n\"We forget that they drove the Spaniards from Cavite to their present\r\nintrenched position, thus saving us a long-continued fight through\r\nthe jungle.\" This gentleman did not tackle the question of inventing\r\na new definition of liberty consistent with alien domination. He\r\nsimply says: \"Give them their liberty and guarantee it to them.\" In\r\nthe face of such plucky patriotism as he had witnessed, political\r\ncasuistry about \"capacity for self-government\" would have hung its\r\nhead. Yet Mr. Bass was by no means a novice. He had served with the\r\nBritish army in Egypt in 1895, through the Armenian massacres of 1896,\r\nand in the Cretan rebellion and Greek War of 1897. His sentiments were\r\nsimply precisely what those of the average American not under military\r\norders would have been at the time. After the fall of Manila he wrote\r\n(August 17th): \"I am inclined to think that the insurgents intend to\r\nfight us if we stay and Spain if we go.\"\r\n\r\nThere were 8500 American troops in the taking of the city of Manila,\r\non August 13, 1898. The Filipinos were ignored by them, although they\r\nafterwards claimed to have helped. As a matter of fact, the Spanish\r\nofficers in command were very anxious to surrender and get back to\r\nSpain. The Filipinos had already made them \"long for peace,\" to use\r\na famous expression of General J. F. Bell. The garrison only put up\r\na very slight resistance, \"to save their face,\" as the Chinese say,\r\ni. e., to save themselves from being court-martialed under some\r\nquixotic article of the Spanish army regulations. The assault was\r\nbegun about 9.30 A.M., and early that afternoon the Spanish flag\r\nhad been lowered from the flag-staff in the main square and the\r\nStars and Stripes run up in its stead, amid the convulsive sobs of\r\ndark-eyed senoritas and the muttered curses of melodramatic Spanish\r\ncavaliers. Thanks to the Filipinos' three and one half months' work,\r\nthe performance only cost us five men killed out of the 8500. The\r\nlist of wounded totalled 43. Our antecedent loss in the trenches\r\nprior to the day of the assault had been fourteen killed and sixty\r\nwounded. So the job was completed, so far as the records show, at a\r\ncost of less than a score of American lives. [120]\r\n\r\nAs Aguinaldo's troops surged forward in the wake of the American\r\nadvance they were stopped by orders from the American commander, and\r\nprevented from following the retreating Spaniards into Manila. They\r\nwere not even allowed what is known to the modern small boy as \"a\r\nlook-in.\" They were not permitted to come into the city to see the\r\nsurrender. President McKinley's message to Congress of December,\r\n1898, describes \"the last scene of the war\" as having been \"enacted\r\nat Manila its starting place.\" [121] It says: \"On August 13th,\r\nafter a brief assault upon the works by the land forces, in which the\r\nsquadron assisted, the capital surrendered unconditionally.\" In this\r\nconnection, by way of explaining Aguinaldo's treatment at the hands of\r\nour generals from the beginning, the message says, \"Divided victory\r\nwas not permissible.\" \"It was fitting that whatever was to be done\r\n* * * should be accomplished by the strong arm of the United States\r\nalone.\" But what takes much of the virtue out of the \"strong arm\"\r\nproposition is that Generals Merritt and Anderson were carrying out\r\nPresident McKinley's orders all the time they were juggling Aguinaldo\r\nout of his positions before Manila, and giving him evasive answers,\r\nuntil the city could be taken by the said \"strong arm\" alone. For,\r\nas the message puts it, in speaking of the taking of the city, \"By\r\nthis the conquest of the Philippine Islands * * * was formally sealed.\"\r\n\r\nWhen General Merritt left Manila on August 30th, he proceeded to Paris\r\nto appear before the Peace Commission there. His views doubtless\r\nhad great weight with them on the momentous questions they had to\r\ndecide. But his views were wholly erroneous, and that they were so\r\nis not surprising. As above stated, he did not even meet Aguinaldo,\r\npurposely holding himself aloof from him and his leaders. He never did\r\nknow how deeply they were incensed at being shut out of Manila when\r\nthe city surrendered. In his report prepared aboard the steamship\r\nChina, en route for Paris, he says: \"Doubtless much dissatisfaction\r\nis felt by the rank and file of the insurgents, but * * * I am of the\r\nopinion that the leaders will be able to prevent serious disturbances,\"\r\netc. (p. 40). If General Merritt had caught the temper of the trenches\r\nhe would have known better, but he saw nothing of the fighting prior\r\nto the final scene, nor did he take the field in person on the day of\r\nthe combined assault on the city, August 13th, and therefore missed\r\nthe supreme opportunity to understand how the Filipinos felt. Says\r\nGeneral Anderson in his report:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I understood from the general commanding that he would be\r\n    personally present on the day of battle. * * * On the morning of\r\n    the 13th, General Babcock came to my headquarters and informed\r\n    me that the major-general commanding would remain on a despatch\r\n    boat. [122]\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed, so reduced was Manila, by reason of the long siege conducted by\r\nthe insurgents, that the assault of August 13th, not only was, but was\r\nexpected to be, little more than a sham battle. Says Lieutenant-Colonel\r\nPope, chief quartermaster, \"On the evening of August 12th an order was\r\nsent me to report with two battalions of the Second Oregon Volunteers,\r\nunder Colonel Summers the next day on the Kwong Hoi to the commanding\r\ngeneral on the Newport, as an escort on his entrance into Manila. At\r\nthe hour named, I reported etc.\" [123] As soon as Spanish \"honor\"\r\nwas satisfied, up went the white flag and General Merritt was duly\r\nescorted ashore and into the city, where he received the surrender\r\nof the Spanish general.\r\n\r\nIn the Civil War, General Merritt had received six successive\r\npromotions for gallantry, at Gettysburg, Yellow Tavern, Five Forks,\r\netc., and had been with Sheridan at Winchester. So the way he\r\n\"commanded\" the assault on Manila is proof only of the obligations\r\nwe then owed the Filipinos. They had left very little to be done.\r\n\r\nIn his account of General Merritt's original personal disembarkation\r\nat Cavite, Mr. Frank Millet acquaints his readers with a Philippine\r\ncustom we afterwards grew quite familiar with and found quite useful,\r\nof keeping your shoes dry in landing from a rowboat on a beach\r\nby riding astride the shoulders of some husky native boatman. The\r\nboatmen make it a point of special pride not to let their passengers\r\nget their feet wet. Mr. Millet tells us that a general in uniform\r\nlooks neither dignified nor picturesque under such circumstances,\r\nand that therefore he will not elaborate on the picture, but that it\r\nis suggestive \"more of the hilarious than of the heroic.\" Presumably\r\nwhen General Merritt went ashore on August 13th, from the despatch\r\nboat from which he had been watching the assault on Manila, to\r\nreceive the surrender of the Spanish general, he followed the same\r\ncustom of the country he had used on the occasion of his original\r\ndisembarkation. So that in the taking of Manila, we were probably\r\nliterally, as well as ethically, like General Mahone of Virginia as\r\nhe is pictured in a familiar post-bellum negro story, according to\r\nwhich the general met a negro on a steep part of the road to heaven,\r\ntold him that St. Peter would only admit mounted parties, mounted\r\nthe negro with the latter's consent, rode on his back the rest of\r\nthe toilsome journey to the heavenly gate, dismounted, knocked,\r\nand was cordially welcomed by the saint at the sacred portal thus:\r\n\"Why how d' ye do, General Mahone; jess tie yoh hoss and come in.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOTIS AND AGUINALDO\r\n\r\n                            Where people and leaders are agreed,\r\n                            What can the archon do?\r\n\r\n                                                        Athenian Maxims.\r\n\r\n\r\nMajor-general Elwell S. Otis and staff arrived at Manila August 21,\r\n1898. [124] He relieved General Merritt and succeeded to the command\r\nof the American troops in the Philippines, August 29th. Archbishop\r\nChapelle, who was papal delegate to the Philippines in 1900, once\r\nsaid to the writer at Manila, in that year, that General Otis was\r\n\"of about the right mental calibre to command a one-company post\r\nin Arizona.\" The impatience manifested in the remark was due to\r\ndifferences between him and the commanding-general about the Friar\r\nquestion. The remark itself was of course intended, and understood, as\r\nhyperbole. But the selection of General Otis to handle the Philippine\r\nsituation was a serious mistake. He was past sixty when he took\r\ncommand. He continued in command from August 29, 1898, to May 5,\r\n1900, a period of some twenty months. The insurrection was held in\r\nabeyance for some five months after he took hold, the leaders hoping\r\nagainst hope that the Treaty of Paris would leave their country to\r\nthem as it did Cuba to the Cubans; and during all that time General\r\nOtis was apparently unable to see that war would be inevitable in the\r\nevent the decision at Paris was adverse to Filipino hopes. A member\r\nof General Otis's staff once told me in speaking of the insurrection\r\nperiod that his chief pooh-poohed the likelihood of an outbreak\r\nright along up to the very day before the outbreak of February 4,\r\n1899, occurred. Before the insurrection came he would not see it,\r\nand after it came he--literally--did not see it; that is to say,\r\nduring fifteen months of fighting he commanded the Eighth Army Corps\r\nfrom a desk in Manila and never once took the field. His Civil War\r\nrecord was all right, but he was now getting well along in years. He\r\nwas also a graduate of the Harvard Law School of the Class of 1861,\r\nrather prided himself on being \"a pretty fair jack-leg lawyer,\" and had\r\na most absorbing passion for the details of administrative work. They\r\nused to say that the only occasion on which General Otis ever went\r\nout of Manila the whole time he was there was when he went up the\r\nrailroad once to Angeles to see that a proper valuation was put on a\r\nthen recently deceased Quartermaster's Department mule. When he left\r\nthe Islands he remarked to a newspaper man that he had had but one \"day\r\noff\" since he had been there. Unswerving devotion to a desk in time of\r\nwar, on the part of the commanding general of the army in the field,\r\nseemed to him an appropriate subject for just pride. This showed his\r\nlimitations. He was a man wholly unable to see the essentials of an\r\nimportant situation, or to take in the whole horizon. He was known\r\nto the Eighth Corps, his command, as a sort of \"Fussy Grandpa,\" his\r\npersonality and general management of things always suggesting the\r\npicture of a painfully near-sighted be-spectacled old gentleman busily\r\nnosing over papers you had submitted, and finding fault to show he knew\r\na thing or two. However, he had many eminently respectable traits, and\r\ndid the best he knew how, though wholly devoid of that noble serenity\r\nof vision which used to enable Mr. Lincoln, amid the darkest and most\r\ntremendous of his problems, to say with a smile to Horace Greeley:\r\n\"Don't shoot the organist, he's doing the best he can.\"\r\n\r\nBefore General Otis relieved General Merritt, the latter had written\r\nAguinaldo politely requesting him to move his troops beyond certain\r\nspecified lines about the city, [125] and Aguinaldo had replied\r\nAugust 27th, agreeing to do so, but asking that the Americans promise\r\nto restore to him the positions thus vacated in the event under the\r\ntreaty the United States should leave the Philippines to Spain. [126]\r\nAugust 31st, Otis notified Aguinaldo, then still at Bacoor, his first\r\ncapital, that General Merritt had been unexpectedly called away,\r\nand that he, Otis, being unacquainted with the situation must take\r\ntime before answering the Aguinaldo letter to Merritt of the 27th. On\r\nSeptember 8th, he did answer, in a preposterously long communication\r\nof about 3000 words, which says, among other things: \"I have not been\r\ninstructed as to what policy the United States intends to pursue in\r\nregard to its legitimate holdings here\"; and therefore declines to\r\npromise anything about restoring the insurgent positions in the event\r\nwe should leave the Islands to Spain under the treaty. Commenting\r\non this in the North American Review for February, 1900, General\r\nAnderson says: \"I believe we came to the parting of the ways when we\r\nrefused this request.\" General Anderson was right. General Merritt\r\nhad on August 21st sent Aguinaldo a memorandum by the hand of Major\r\nJ. Franklin Bell which promised: \"Care will be taken to leave him\r\n[Aguinaldo] in as good condition as he was found by the forces of the\r\ngovernment.\" [127] In the role of political henchman for President\r\nMcKinley, which General Otis seems to have conceived it his duty to\r\nplay from the very beginning in the Philippines, it thus appears that\r\nhe was not troubled about keeping unsullied the faith and honor of\r\nthe government as pledged by his predecessor. His 3000-word letter to\r\nAguinaldo of September 8th ignores Merritt's promise as coolly as if\r\nit had never been made. His only concern appears to have been to leave\r\nthe government free to throw the Filipinos overboard if it should\r\nwish to. He peevishly implies later on that Aguinaldo's requests in\r\nthis regard were merely a cloak for designs against us (p. 40). But\r\nhis real reason is given in a sort of stage \"aside\"--a letter to\r\nthe Adjutant-General of the army dated September 12, 1898, wherein he\r\nexplains: \"Should I promise them that in case of the return of the city\r\nto Spain, upon United States evacuation, their forces would be placed\r\nby us in positions which they now occupy, I thoroughly believe that\r\nthey would evacuate at once. But, of course, under the international\r\nobligations resting upon us * * * no such promise can be given.\" [128]\r\nIn the sacred name of National Honor what of the Merritt promise? You\r\nonly have to turn a few pages in the War Department Report for 1899\r\nfrom the Merritt promise to the Otis repudiation of it. Yes, General\r\nAnderson was right. It was when General Otis practically repudiated\r\nin writing the written promise of his predecessor, General Merritt,\r\nthat we \"came to the parting of the ways\" in our relations with the\r\nFilipinos. Let no American suppose for a moment that the author of\r\nthis volume is engaged in the ungracious, and frequently deservedly\r\nthankless task of mere muck-raking. He never met General Otis but once,\r\nand then for a very brief official interview of an agreeable nature. He\r\nis only attempting to make a small contribution to the righting of a\r\ngreat wrong unwittingly done by a great, free, and generous people to\r\nanother people then struggling to be free--a wrong which he doubts\r\nnot will one day be righted, whether he lives to see it so righted\r\nor not. General Otis's letter to the Adjutant-General of the army of\r\nSeptember 12th, above quoted, shows that he was holding himself in\r\nreadiness to carry out in the Philippines any political programme the\r\nAdministration might determine upon, which would mean that he would\r\nafterwards come home and tell how entirely righteous that programme\r\nhad been. Had the Administration hearkened back to Admiral Dewey's\r\nsuggestion that the Filipinos were far superior to the Cubans, and\r\ndecided to set before General Otis in the Philippines the same task\r\nit had set before General Wood in Cuba, we would have heard nothing\r\nabout Filipino \"incapacity for self-government.\" General Otis would\r\nhave taken his cue from the President, his commander-in chief, and\r\nsaid: \"I cordially concur in the opinion of Admiral Dewey.\" Then he\r\nwould have gone to work in a spirit of generous rivalry to do in the\r\nPhilippines just what Wood did in Cuba. And the task would have been\r\neasier. Had the Administration taken the view urged by Judge Gray,\r\nas a member of the Paris Peace Commission, that \"if we had captured\r\nCadiz and the Carlists had helped us [we] would not owe duty to stay\r\nby them at the conclusion of the war,\" [129] and therefore we were not\r\nbound to see the Filipinos through their struggle, General Otis would\r\nhave adopted that view with equal loyalty and in the presidential\r\ncampaign of 1900, he would have furnished the Administration with\r\narguments to justify that course. This would have been an easy task,\r\nalso, for two of Spain's fleets had been destroyed by us, leaving\r\nher but one to guard her home coast cities, and making the sending\r\nof reinforcements to the besieged and demoralized garrison of Manila\r\nimpossible. The native army she relied on throughout the archipelago\r\nhad gone over bodily to the patriot cause, and there was no hope\r\nof successful resistance to it. But General Otis did not have the\r\nboundless prestige of Admiral Dewey and so volunteered no advice. As\r\nsoon as the Administration chose its course, he set to work to prove\r\nthe correctness of it. From him, of course, came all the McKinley\r\nAdministration's original arguments against doing for the Filipinos\r\nas we did in the case of Cuba. He was the only legitimate source\r\nthe American people could look to at that time to help them in their\r\ndilemma. They were standing with reluctant feet where democracy and\r\nits antithesis meet, and Otis was their sole guide. But the guide\r\nwas of the kind who wait until you point and ask \"Is that the right\r\ndirection?\" and then answer \"Yes.\" Four days after General Otis sent\r\nhis above quoted letter of September 12th, to Adjutant-General Corbin,\r\nMr. McKinley signed his instructions to the Paris Peace Commissioners,\r\ndirecting them to insist on the cession of Luzon at least, the\r\ninstructions being full of eloquent but specious argument about the\r\nnecessity of establishing a guardianship over people of whom we then\r\nknew nothing. From that day forward General Otis bent himself to the\r\ntask of showing the righteousness of that course. \"I will let nothing\r\ngo that will hurt the Administration,\" was his favorite expression\r\nto the newspaper correspondents when they used to complain about\r\nhis press censorship. Hypocrisy is defined to be \"a false assumption\r\nof piety or virtue.\" The false assumption of piety or virtue which\r\nhas handicapped the American occupation of the Philippines from the\r\nbeginning, and which will always handicap it, until we throw off the\r\nmask and honestly set to work to give the Filipinos a square deal on\r\nthe question of whether they can or cannot run a decent government of\r\ntheir own if permitted, is traceable back to the Otis letter to the\r\nAdjutant-General of September 12, 1898, ignoring General Merritt's\r\npromise to leave Aguinaldo \"in as good condition as he was found by\r\nthe forces of the government\" in case we should, under the terms of\r\nthe treaty of peace, leave the Islands to Spain.\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis's letter of September 8th to Aguinaldo is apparently\r\nintended to convince him that he ought to consider everything the\r\nAmericans had done up to date as exactly the correct thing, according\r\nto the standards of up-to-date, philanthropic, liberty-loving nations\r\nwhich pity double-dealing as mediaeval; and that he should cheer up,\r\nand feel grateful and happy, instead of sulking, Achilles-like, in his\r\ntents; and furthermore--which was the crux--that he must move said\r\ntents. General Otis does not forget \"that the revolutionary forces\r\nunder your command have made many sacrifices in the interest of civil\r\nliberty (observe, he does not call it independence) and for the welfare\r\nof your people\"; admits that they have \"endured great hardships, and\r\nhave rendered aid\"; and avers, as a reason for Aguinaldo's evacuating\r\nthat part of the environs of Manila occupied by his troops: \"It [the\r\nwar with Spain] was undertaken by the United States for humanity's sake\r\n* * * not for * * * aggrandizement or for any national profit.\" After\r\nstating, as above indicated, that he does not yet know what the\r\npolicy of the United States is to be \"in regard to its legitimate\r\nholdings here,\" General Otis proceeds to declare that in any event\r\nhe will not be a party to any joint occupation of any part of the\r\ncity, bay, and harbor of Manila--the territory covered by the Peace\r\nProtocol of August 13th--and that Aguinaldo must effect the evacuation\r\ndemanded in the letter of General Merritt \"before Tuesday the 15th\"\r\n(of September), i.e., within a week. Aguinaldo finally withdrew his\r\ntroops, after much useless parleying and much waste of ink.\r\n\r\nThere was some of the parleying and ink, however, that was not wholly\r\nwasted. But to properly appreciate it as illustrative of the fortitude\r\nand tact which the early Filipino leaders seem to have combined in\r\na remarkable degree, some prefatory data are essential.\r\n\r\nAguinaldo's capital was then at Bacoor, one of the small coast villages\r\nyou pass through in going by land from Manila to Cavite. From Manila\r\nover to Cavite by water is about seven miles, and by land about three\r\nor four times that. The coast line from Manila to Cavite makes a\r\nloop, so that a straight line over the water from Manila to Cavite\r\nsubtends a curve, near the Cavite end of which lies Bacoor. Thus,\r\nBacoor, being at the mercy of the big guns at Cavite, and also easily\r\naccessible by a land force from Manila, to say nothing of Dewey's\r\nmighty armada riding at anchor in the offing, was a good place to\r\nmove away from. There it lay, right in the lion's jaws, should the\r\nlion happen to get hungry. Aguinaldo had reflected on all this,\r\nand had determined to get himself a capital away from \"the city,\r\nbay, and harbor of Manila,\" that is to say, to take his head out\r\nof the lion's jaws. General Otis's demand of September 8th that\r\nhe move his troops out of the suburbs of Manila determined him to\r\nmove his capital as well. He moved it to a place called Malolos, in\r\nBulacan province. Bulacan lies over on the north shore of Manila Bay,\r\nopposite Cavite province on the south shore. Malolos is situated some\r\ndistance inland, out of sight and range of a fleet's guns, and about\r\ntwenty-odd miles by railroad northwest of Manila. Malolos was also\r\ndesirable because it was in the heart of an insurgent province having a\r\npopulation of nearly a quarter of a million people, a province which,\r\nby reason of being on the north side of the bay, was sure to be in\r\ntouch, strategically and politically, with all Luzon north of the\r\nPasig River, just as Cavite province, the birthplace of Aguinaldo,\r\nand also of the revolutionary government, had been with all Luzon\r\nsouth of the Pasig. Should the worst come to the worst--and as has\r\nalready been indicated, the insurgents played a sweepstake game from\r\nthe beginning for independence, with only war as the limit--northern\r\nLuzon had more inaccessible mountains from which to conduct such\r\na struggle for an indefinite period than southern Luzon. But while\r\nthe Otis demand of September 8th decided the matter of the change\r\nof capital, Aguinaldo could not afford to tell his troops that he\r\nwas moving them from the environs of Manila because made to. He was\r\ngoing to accept war cheerfully when it should become necessary to\r\nfight for independence, but he still had some hopes of the Paris\r\nPeace Conference deciding to do with the Philippines as with Cuba,\r\nand wished to await patiently the outcome of that conference. Besides,\r\nhe was getting in shipments of guns all the time, as fast as the\r\nrevenues of his government would permit, and thus his ability to\r\nprotract an ultimate war for independence was constantly enlarging\r\nby accretion. The Hong Kong conference of the Filipino revolutionary\r\nleaders held in the city named on May 4, 1898, at which Aguinaldo\r\npresided, and which mapped out a programme covering every possible\r\ncontingency, has already been mentioned. Its minutes say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If Washington proposes to carry out the fundamental principles\r\n    of its Constitution, it is most improbable that an attempt will\r\n    be made to colonize the Philippines or annex them. [130]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the minutes of this same meeting as we saw\r\nrecognized that America might be tempted into entering upon a career\r\nof colonization, once she should get a foothold in the islands. The\r\nprogramme of Aguinaldo and his people was thus, from the beginning,\r\nnot to precipitate hostilities until it should become clear that,\r\nin the matter of land-grabbing, the gleam of hope held out by the\r\nAmerican programme for Cuba was illusive. According to the minutes of\r\nthe meeting alluded to, such a contingency would, of course, \"drive\r\nthem, the Filipinos * * * to a struggle for their independence,\r\neven if they should succumb to the weight of the yoke,\" etc. Such\r\na struggle, as all the world knows, did ultimately ensue. That\r\npart of the parleying following Otis's demand of September 8th\r\n(that Aguinaldo move his troops) which was not useless was this:\r\nIn order to \"save their face,\" with the rank and file of their\r\narmy, the Filipino Commissioners asked General Otis \"if I [Otis,]\r\nwould express in writing a simple request to Aguinaldo to withdraw\r\nto the lines which I designated--something which he could show to\r\nthe troops.\" [131] So, on September 13th, General Otis wrote such a\r\n\"request,\" and Aguinaldo moved his troops as demanded, but no farther\r\nthan demanded. He wanted to be in the best position possible in case\r\nthe United States should finally leave the Philippines to Spain,\r\nand always so insisted. Long afterward General Otis insinuated in\r\nhis report that this insistence, which was uniformly pressed until\r\nafter the Treaty was signed, was mere dishonest pretence, to cloak\r\nwarlike intentions against the United States. Yet, as we have seen\r\nabove, one of our Peace Commissioners at Paris, Judge Gray, just\r\nabout the same time, was taking that contingency quite as seriously\r\nas did Aguinaldo. And early in May, 1898, our Secretary of the Navy,\r\nMr. Long, had cabled Admiral Dewey \"not to have political alliances\r\nwith the insurgents * * * that would incur liability to maintain their\r\ncause in the future.\" [132] Before moving his troops pursuant to the\r\nOtis demand of September 8th, the Otis \"request\" was duly published\r\nto the insurgent army, and as the insurgents withdrew, the American\r\ntroops presented arms in most friendly fashion. \"They certainly made a\r\nbrave show,\" says Mr. Millet (Expedition to the Philippines, p. 255),\r\n\"for they were neatly uniformed, had excellent rifles, marched well,\r\nand looked very soldierly and intelligent.\" \"The withdrawal,\" says\r\nGeneral Otis (p. 10), \"was effected adroitly, as the insurgents marched\r\nout in excellent spirits, cheering the American forces.\" Absolute\r\nmaster of all Luzon outside Manila at this time, with complete\r\nmachinery of government in each province for all matters of justice,\r\ntaxes, and police, an army of some 30,000 men at his beck, and his\r\nwhole people a unit at his back, Aguinaldo formally inaugurated\r\nhis permanent government--permanent as opposed to the previous\r\nprovisional government--with a Constitution, Congress, and Cabinet,\r\npatterned after our own, [133] just as the South American republics\r\nhad done before him when they were freed from Spain, at Malolos, the\r\nnew capital, on September 15, 1898. The next day, September 16th, at\r\nWashington, President McKinley delivered to his Peace Commissioners,\r\nthen getting ready to start for the Paris Peace Conference, their\r\nletter of instructions, directing them to insist on the cession by\r\nSpain to the United States of the island of Luzon \"at least.\" [134]\r\nIn other words, the day after the little Filipino republic, gay\r\nwith banners and glad with music, started forth on its journey,\r\nMr. McKinley signed its death-warrant. The political student of 1912\r\nmay say just here, \"Oh, I read all that in the papers at the time,\r\nor at least it was all ventilated in the Presidential campaign of\r\n1900.\" Mr. McKinley's instructions to the Paris Peace Commission were\r\nnot made public until after the Presidential election of 1900. To be\r\nspecific, they were first printed and given out to the public in 1901,\r\nin Senate Document 148, having been extracted from the jealous custody\r\nof the Executive by a Senate resolution. It was not until then that the\r\nveil was lifted. By that time, no American who was not transcendental\r\nenough to have lost his love for the old maxim, \"Right or wrong, my\r\ncountry,\" cared to hear the details of the story. The Filipinos and\r\n\"our boys\" had been diligently engaged in killing each other for a\r\ncouple of years, and the American people said, \"A truce to scolding;\r\nlet us finish this war, now we are in it.\"\r\n\r\nBut to return from the death-warrant of the Philippine republic\r\nsigned by Mr. McKinley on September 16th, to its christening,\r\nor inauguration, the day before. Mr. Millet gives an intensely\r\ninteresting account of the inaugural ceremonies of September 15th,\r\nwhich as Manila correspondent of the London Times and Harper's Weekly\r\nhe had the good fortune to witness. Says he:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The date was at last * * * fixed for September 15th. A few days\r\n    before Aguinaldo had made a triumphant entry into Malolos in\r\n    a carriage drawn by white horses, and there had been a general\r\n    celebration of his arrival, with speeches, a gala dinner, open air\r\n    concerts, and a military parade. Mr. Higgins (an Englishman), the\r\n    manager of the Railway, kindly offered to take me up to Malolos to\r\n    witness the ceremony of the inauguration of the new government.\r\n    * * * The only other passenger was to be Aguinaldo's secretary\r\n    * * * a small boyish-looking young man. * * * [135]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems there had been a strike of the native employees of the\r\nrailway up the road.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Higgins calmly remarked to the secretary that, in his opinion,\r\n    if the affairs of the Filipino government were managed in the\r\n    future as they were at present, the proposed republic would be\r\n    nothing but a cheap farce. The secretary timidly asked what there\r\n    was to complain about.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen came a tirade from Higgins, ending with, \"I am going to lay this\r\n* * * before Aguinaldo to-day, and I shall expect you to arrange an\r\ninterview for my friend and myself.\" Then, turning to the astonished\r\nMillet, he said in English: \"It does these chaps good to be talked\r\nto straight from the shoulder. Since they came to Malolos, the earth\r\nisn't big enough to hold them.\"\r\n\r\nThis scene on the train is, decidedly, as Thomas Carlyle would say,\r\n\"of real interest to universal history.\" Mr. Millet's Government was\r\na lion about to eat a lamb, but the head of his nation, Mr. McKinley,\r\nclothed with absolute authority in the premises for the nonce, was\r\nbalking at the diet. Now, Mr. Millet rather admired the British\r\nboldness, just as a Northern man likes to hear a Southerner talk\r\nstraight from the shoulder to a \"darkey.\" As soon as the era of good\r\nfeeling was over, our people quit treating the Filipinos as Perry\r\ndid the Japanese in 1854, and began calling them \"niggers.\" In fact\r\nthe commanding general found it necessary a little later to put a\r\nstop to this pernicious practice among the soldiers by issuing a\r\nGeneral Order prohibiting it. But Mr. Millet's admiration would have\r\nbeen somewhat toned down had he known what we found out later. The\r\nreal secret of Higgins's personal arrogance was this. The Filipino\r\ngovernment needed his railroad in its business. During the war\r\nwhich followed, the insurgents long controlled a large part of this\r\nrailway, from Manila to Dagupan, which was the only railway in the\r\nPhilippines. The railway properties suffered much damage incident\r\nto the war, and--just how willingly is beside the question--the\r\ncompany rendered material aid to the insurgent cause. So much did\r\nthey render, that when Higgins had the assurance later to want our\r\nGovernment to pay the damages his properties had suffered at the\r\nhands of the insurgents, our government at Manila promptly turned his\r\nclaim down. Subsequently the London office of his company actually\r\ninveigled the British Foreign Office into making representation to\r\nour State Department about the matter--obviously a very grave step,\r\nin international law. The claim was promptly turned down by Washington\r\nalso, and, happily, that \"closed the incident.\" [136]\r\n\r\nHaving exploded Mr. Millet's bubble, let us resume the thread of\r\nhis story:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We reached the station [at Malolos] in about an hour and a half.\r\n    * * * The town numbers perhaps thirty or forty thousand people.\r\n    * * * From the first humble nipa shack to the great square where\r\n    the convent stands, thousands of insurgent flags fluttered from\r\n    every window and every post. * * * Every man had an insurgent\r\n    tri-color cockade in his hat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen follows a detailed account of being introduced, after some\r\nceremony, to Aguinaldo, who is described as \"a small individual,\r\nin full evening black suit, and flowing black tie.\" Higgins made his\r\ncomplaint about the strikers, and Aguinaldo said, \"I will attend to\r\nthis matter of the strikers,\" and then changed the topic, asking if\r\nthe visitors did not wish to attend the opening of the Congress--which\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. Millet's account, it is evident that, like Admiral Dewey\r\nand most of the Americans who first dealt with the Filipinos except\r\nGenerals Anderson, MacArthur, and J. F. Bell, he failed to take\r\nthe Filipinos as seriously as the facts demanded. At that time the\r\nJapanese had not yet taught the world that national aspirations are\r\nnot necessarily to be treated with contumely because a people are small\r\nof stature and not white of skin. Consul Wildman at Hong Kong at first\r\nwrote the State Department quite peevishly that Aguinaldo seemed much\r\nmore concerned about the kind of cane he should wear than about the\r\nfigure he might make in history. Wildman did not then know, apparently,\r\nthat canes, with all Spanish-Filipino colonial officialdom, were\r\nbadges of official rank, like shoulder-straps are with us. The reader\r\nwill also remember the toothbrush incident hereinbefore reproduced,\r\ntold by Admiral Dewey to the Senate Committee, in 1902. That incident,\r\nnaturally enough, amused the Committee not a little. But we who know\r\nthe Filipino know it was merely an awkward and embarrassed answer due\r\nto diffidence, and made on the spur of the moment to cloak some real\r\nreason which if disclosed would not seem so childish.\r\n\r\nMisunderstanding is the principal cause of hate in this world. When\r\nyou understand people, hatred disappears in a way strikingly analogous\r\nto the disappearance of darkness on the arrival of light. The more\r\nyou know of the educated patriotic Filipino, the more certain you\r\nbecome that the government we destroyed in 1898 would have worked\r\nquite as well as most any of the republics now in operation between\r\nthe Rio Grande and Patagonia. The masses of the people down there,\r\nthe peons, are probably quite as ignorant and docile as the Filipino\r\ntao (peasant), and I question if the educated men of Latin America,\r\nthe class of men who, after all, control in every country, could,\r\nafter meeting and knowing the corresponding class in the Philippines,\r\nget their own consent to declare the latter their inferiors either\r\nin intelligence, character, or patriotism.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the inauguration. Mr. Millet saw the inaugural\r\nceremonies in the church, and heard Aguinaldo's address to the\r\nCongress. Of the audience he says \"few among them would have escaped\r\nnotice in a crowd for they were exceptionally alert, keen, and\r\nintelligent in appearance.\" Of this same Congress and government,\r\nMr. John Barrett, who was American Minister to Siam about that\r\ntime, and is now (1912) head of the Bureau of American Republics\r\nat Washington--an institution organized and run for the purpose\r\nof persuading Latin-America that we do not belong to the Imperial\r\nInternational Society for the Partition of the Earth and that we are\r\nnot in the business of gobbling up little countries on pretext of\r\n\"policing\" them--said in an address before the Shanghai Chamber of\r\nCommerce on January 12, 1899:\r\n\r\n\r\n    He [Aguinaldo] has organized a government which has practically\r\n    been administering the affairs of that great island [Luzon] since\r\n    the American occupation of Manila, which is certainly better\r\n    than the former administration; he has a properly constituted\r\n    Cabinet and Congress, the members of which compare favorably with\r\n    Japanese statesmen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe present Philippine Assembly had not had its first meeting when I\r\nleft the Islands in the spring of 1905. It was organized in 1907. In\r\nthe summer of 1911, I had the pleasure of renewing an old and very\r\ncordial acquaintance with Dr. Heiser, Director of Public Health\r\nof the Philippine Islands, who is one of the most considerable men\r\nconnected with our government out there, and is also thoroughly in\r\nsympathy with its indefinite continuance in its present form. The\r\nDoctor is a broad-gauged man likely to be worth to any government,\r\nin matters of Public Health, whatever such government could reasonably\r\nafford to pay in the way of salary, and is doubtless well-paid by the\r\nPhilippine Insular Government. He can hardly be blamed, therefore,\r\nfor being in sympathy with its indefinite continuance in its present\r\nform. Doctor Heiser is a man of too much genuine dignity to be very\r\nmuch addicted to slang, but when I asked him about the Philippine\r\nAssembly, I think he said it was \"a cracker-jack.\" At any rate,\r\nI have never heard any legislative body spoken of in more genuinely\r\ncomplimentary terms than those in which he described the Philippine\r\nAssembly. I learned from him incidentally that their \"capacity for\r\nself-government\" is so crude, however, as yet, that the members have\r\nnot yet learned to read newspapers while a colleague whose seat is\r\nnext to theirs is addressing the house and trying to get the attention\r\nof his fellows, nor do they keep up such a buzz of conversation that\r\nthe man who has the floor cannot hear himself talk. They listen to\r\nthe programme of the public business.\r\n\r\nSome five years ago in an article written for the North American Review\r\nconcerning the Philippine problem, the author of the present volume\r\nsaid, among other things: \"During nearly four years of service on the\r\nbench in the Philippines the writer heard as much genuine, impassioned,\r\nand effective eloquence from Filipino lawyers, saw exhibited in the\r\ntrial of causes as much industrious preparation, and zealous, loyal\r\nadvocacy of the rights of clients, as any ordinary nisi prius judge\r\nat home is likely to meet with in the same length of time.\" [137] Any\r\ncountry that has plenty of good lawyers and plenty of good soldiers,\r\nbacked by plenty of good farmers, is capable of self-government. As\r\nPresident Schurman of Cornell University, who headed the first\r\nPhilippine Commission, the one that went out in 1899, said in closing\r\nhis Founder's Day Address at that institution on January 11, 1902:\r\n\"Any decent kind of government of Filipinos by Filipinos is better\r\nthan the best possible government of Filipinos by Americans.\" The\r\nMalolos government which Mr. Millet saw inaugurated on September 15,\r\n1898, would probably have filled this bill. Had the Filipino people\r\nthen possessed the consciousness of racial and political unity as a\r\npeople which was developed by their subsequent long struggle against\r\nus for independence, and which has been steadily developing more and\r\nmore under the mild sway of a quasi-freedom whose princely prodigality\r\nin spreading education is marred only by its declared programme that\r\nno living beneficiary thereof may hope to see the independence of\r\nhis country, and that the present generation must resign itself to\r\ntariff schedules \"fixed\" at Washington, there is no reasonable doubt\r\nthat the original Malolos government of 1898 would have been a very\r\n\"decent kind of government.\"\r\n\r\nAll through the last four months of 1898, the two hostile armies faced\r\neach other in a mood which it needed but a spark to ignite, awaiting\r\nthe outcome of the peace negotiations arranged for in September,\r\ncommenced in October, and concluded in December. While they are thus\r\nengaged about Manila, let us turn to a happier picture, the situation\r\nin the provinces under the Aguinaldo government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE WILCOX-SARGENT TRIP\r\n\r\n                A smiling, peaceful, and plenteous land\r\n                As yet unblighted by the scourge of war;\r\n                Where happiness and hospitality walk hand in hand\r\n                And new-born Freedom bows to Law.\r\n\r\n                                                              Anonymous.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter, we saw Aguinaldo's republic formally established\r\nat Malolos, September 15th, claiming jurisdiction over all Luzon. In\r\nChapter IV., entitled \"Merritt and Aguinaldo,\" we saw the political\r\ncondition of southern Luzon in August, 1898, and the following months,\r\nand verified the correctness of Aguinaldo's claims as to complete\r\nmastery there then. Let us now examine the state of affairs in northern\r\nLuzon in the fall of 1898.\r\n\r\nIn Senate Document 196, 56th Congress, 1st Session, dated February\r\n26, 1900, transmitted by Secretary of the Navy Long, in response to\r\na Senate resolution, may be found a report of a tour of observation\r\nthrough the half of Luzon Island which lies north of Manila and the\r\nPasig River, made between October 8 and November 20, 1898,--note\r\nthe dates, for the Paris Peace Conference began October 1st and\r\nended December 10th,--by Paymaster W. B. Wilcox and Naval Cadet\r\nL. R. Sargent. This report was submitted by them to Admiral Dewey under\r\ndate of November 23, 1898, and by him forwarded to the Navy Department\r\nfor its information, with the comment that it \"in my opinion contains\r\nthe most complete and reliable information obtainable in regard to the\r\npresent state of the northern part of Luzon Island.\" The Admiral's\r\nendorsement was not sent to the Senate along with the report. It\r\nappears in a book afterwards published by Paymaster Wilcox in 1901,\r\nentitled Through Luzon on Highways and Byways. The book is merely an\r\nelaboration of the report, and reproduces most of the report, if not\r\nall of it, verbatim. The book of Paymaster Wilcox may be treated as,\r\npractically, official, for historical purposes. The preface recites\r\nthat in October, 1898, American control was effective only in Manila\r\nand Cavite, that the insurgents, under Aguinaldo, who had proclaimed\r\nhimself President of the whole Archipelago, immediately after Dewey's\r\nvictory, were in supposedly complete possession of every part of\r\nthe Island outside of these two cities, that their lines were so\r\nclose to the outposts of our army that their people could at times\r\nconverse with our soldiers, and that General Otis's authority did\r\nnot extend much beyond a three-mile radius from the centre of Manila,\r\nwhile Admiral Dewey held and operated the navy-yard at Cavite. \"Even\r\nthe country between Manila and Cavite was in the hands of Aguinaldo,\r\nso much so that our officers had been refused permission to land at\r\nany intermediate point by water, and were prohibited from traversing\r\nthe distance by road.\" Wilcox and Sargent procured leave of absence\r\nfrom Admiral Dewey to make their trip. They went first to Malolos, but\r\nfailed to get anything in the way of safe-conduct from Aguinaldo. He\r\nis described, however, as of \"great force of character * * * and\r\nhe dominates all around him with a power that seems peculiar to\r\nhimself.\" Wilcox had seen him before at Cavite. \"He adroitly read\r\nbetween the lines that the Government of the United States did not\r\nthen, nor would it at any future time, recognize his authority,\"\r\nsays the writer.\r\n\r\nOur travellers left Manila, October 8, 1898, on the Manila-Dagupan\r\nRailway, for a place called Bayambang, which is the capital of\r\nPangasinan province, about one hundred miles north of Manila. In\r\nPangasinan \"the people were all very respectful and polite and offered\r\nthe hospitality of their homes.\" From Bayambang they struck off from\r\nthe railroad and proceeded eastward comfortably and unmolested a day's\r\njourney, to a town in the adjoining province of Nueva Ecija (Rosales)\r\nwhere they received a cordial reception at the hands of the Presidente\r\n(Mayor)--Aguinaldo's Presidente of course, not the Presidente left\r\nover from the Spanish regime. \"At this time all the local government\r\nof the different towns was in the hands of Aguinaldo's adherents,\"\r\nsays the descriptive itinerary we are following. The tourists were\r\nprovided at Rosales by order of Aguinaldo with a military escort,\r\n\"which was continued by relays all the way to Aparri\" (the northernmost\r\ntown of Luzon, at the mouth of the Cagayan River). Paymaster Wilcox\r\nsays he carried five hundred Mexican dollars in his saddle-bags,\r\nbut used only a trifling portion of this amount, \"for in every town\r\nmy entertainment was given without pay.\" They went from Rosales to\r\nHumingan, in Nueva Ecija. At Humingan they were again entertained\r\nby the Presidente at dinner, with music following, and comfortably\r\nhoused. The Presidente made many inquiries about \"the War with\r\nSpain and their own future.\" Their future, as revealed by the raised\r\ncurtain of a year later, was that their country was being overrun by\r\nLawton's Division of the Eighth Army Corps, the author of this volume\r\nhaving passed through this same town of Humingan in November, 1899,\r\nas an officer of the scouts used to develop fire for General Lawton's\r\ncolumn. They journeyed eastward through the province of Nueva Ecija\r\nfrom Humingan to a little village (Puncan) in the foothills of the\r\nmountains they planned to cross. Of this place and the hospitality\r\nthere, our traveller remarks: \"I shall never forget the welcome of the\r\nlocal official\" the Presidente. Thence they proceeded a few more stages\r\nand parasangs, northward over the Caranglan pass, into Nueva Vizcaya\r\nprovince, the watershed of north central Luzon, and thence down the\r\nvalley of the Cagayan River via Iligan and Tuguegarao to Aparri, being\r\nalways hospitably entertained in every town through which they passed\r\nby the Presidente or Mayor of the town, the local representative of\r\nthe Philippine republic. In the New York Independent of September 14,\r\n1899, Cadet Sargent, in an article about this trip, gives the words\r\nof the new Filipino national Hymn, which he describes as sung with\r\ngreat enthusiasm everywhere he and Wilcox were entertained in the\r\nvarious towns. I desire to preserve a sample verse of it here. The\r\nmusic it is set to is much like the Marseillaise--quite as stirring:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    Del sueno de tres siglos\r\n                    Hermanos Despertad!\r\n                    Gritando \"Fuera Espana!\r\n                    Viva La Libertad!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich, being interpreted, means:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    From the sleep of three centuries\r\n                    Brothers, awake!\r\n                    Crying \"Out with Spain!\r\n                    Live Liberty!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHad another Sargent and another Wilcox made a similar trip through\r\nthe provinces of southern Luzon about this same time, under similar\r\nfriendly auspices, before we turned friendship to hate and fear and\r\nmisery, in the name of Benevolent Assimilation, they would, we now\r\nknow, have found similar conditions.\r\n\r\nSome suspicions were aroused on one or two occasions, but once the\r\nlocal authorities became convinced that the trip was being made\r\nby consent of \"The Illustrious Presidente\" (Aguinaldo--\"El Egregio\r\nPresidente\" is the Spanish of it) all was sunshine again. The Mayor\r\nof each town--the Presidente--would receive from the escort coming\r\nwith them from the last town they had stopped at, a letter from the\r\nMayor, or Presidente, of said last town; the old escort would return to\r\ntheir town, and a new one would be provided to give them safe-conduct\r\nto the next town. This was no new-fangled scheme of Aguinaldo's. It\r\nwas an ancient custom of the Spanish Government, and was an ideal\r\nnucleus of administration for the new government. Curiously enough,\r\nthe army knew practically nothing of this trip in the days of the\r\nearly fighting. All that country was to us a terra incognita, until\r\noverrun by Captain Bacthelor, with a part of the 25th Infantry\r\nin the fall of 1899, the following year. So was the rest of the\r\narchipelago a like terra incognita, until likewise slowly conquered\r\nby hard fighting. That is why we so utterly failed to understand\r\nwhat a wonderfully complete \"going concern\" Aguinaldo's government\r\nhad become throughout the Philippine archipelago before the Treaty of\r\nParis was signed. Descending from the watershed of north central Luzon\r\nin the province of Nueva Viscaya already mentioned, our travellers\r\nreached the town of Carig, in the foothills which fringe that side\r\nof the watershed. There they were met by Simeon Villa, military\r\ncommander of Isabela province, the man who was chief of staff to\r\nAguinaldo afterwards, and was captured by General Funston along\r\nwith Aguinaldo in the spring of 1901. Villa's immediate superior was\r\nColonel Tirona, at Aparri, the colonel commanding all the insurgent\r\nforces of the Cagayan valley. Villa was accompanied by his aide,\r\nLieutenant Ventura Guzman. The latter is an old acquaintance of the\r\nauthor of the present volume, who tried him afterwards, in 1901, for\r\nplaying a minor part in the murder of an officer of the Spanish army\r\ncommitted under Villa's orders just prior to, or about the time of,\r\nthe Wilcox-Sargent visit. He was found guilty, and sentenced, but later\r\nliberated under President Roosevelt's amnesty of 1902. He was guilty,\r\nbut the deceased, so the people in the Cagayan valley used to say,\r\nin being tortured to death, got only the same sort of medicine he had\r\noften administered thereabouts. At any rate, that was the broad theory\r\nof the amnesty in wiping out all these old cases. Villa was a Tagal\r\nand had come up from Manila with the expedition commanded by Colonel\r\nTirona, which expedition was fitted out with guns furnished Aguinaldo\r\nby Admiral Dewey, or, if not furnished, permitted to be furnished. But\r\nGuzman was a member of one of the wealthiest and most influential\r\nnative families of that province (Isabela). General Otis's reports\r\nare full of the most inexcusable blunders about how \"the Tagals\"\r\ntook possession of the various provinces and made the people do this\r\nor that. Villa's relations with Guzman were just about those of a New\r\nYorker or a Bostonian sent up to Vermont in the days of the American\r\nRevolution to help organize the resistance there, in conjunction with\r\none of the local leaders of the patriot cause in the Green Mountain\r\nState. Both were members of the Katipunan, the Filipino Revolutionary\r\nSecret Society, an organization patterned after Masonry, membership\r\nin which was always treated by the Spaniards as sedition, and usually\r\nvisited with capital punishment. Nearly every Filipino of any spirit\r\nbelonged to it on May 1, 1898, the date of the naval battle of Manila\r\nBay. It is the all-pervading completeness of this organization at that\r\ntime--it could give old Tammany Hall cards and spades--which explains\r\nthe astonishing rapidity of Aguinaldo's political success, i.e., the\r\nastonishing rapidity with which the Malolos Government acquired control\r\nof Luzon between May and October, 1898. Their cabalistic watchword was\r\n\"Paisano\" (fellow-countryman), their battle cry \"Independence.\" In\r\nthe fall of 1898, at the time of this Wilcox-Sargent trip through\r\nLuzon, the Filipinos really \"had tasted the sweets of Independence,\"\r\nto use the phrase of the people of Iloilo in declining on that ground\r\nto surrender to General Miller in December thereafter and electing the\r\narbitrament of war. The writer is perhaps as familiar with the history\r\nof that Cagayan valley as almost any other American. It is true there\r\nwere cruelties practised by the Filipinos on the Spaniards. But they\r\nwere ebullitions of revenge for three centuries of tyranny. They do\r\nnot prove unfitness for self-government. I for one prefer to follow\r\nthe example set by the Roosevelt amnesty of 1902, and draw the veil\r\nover all those matters. With the Spaniards it was a case of Sauve qui\r\npeut. With the Filipinos, it was a case, as old man Dimas Guzman,\r\nfather to this Lieutenant Ventura we have just met, used to put\r\nit, of Me las vais a pagar, which, liberally interpreted, means,\r\n\"The bad quarter of an hour has arrived for the Spaniards. The day\r\nof reckoning has come.\" I sentenced both Dimas and Ventura to life\r\nimprisonment for being accessory to the murder of the Spanish officer\r\nabove named, Lieutenant Piera. Villa officiated as archfiend of the\r\ngruesome occasion. I am quite sure I would have hung Villa without any\r\ncompunction at that time, if I could have gotten hold of him. I tried\r\nto get hold of him, but Governor Taft's Attorney-General, Mr. Wilfley,\r\nwrote me that Villa was somewhere over on the mainland of Asia on\r\nBritish territory, and extradition would involve application to the\r\nLondon Foreign Office. The intimation was that we had trouble enough\r\nof our own without borrowing any from feuds that had existed under\r\nour predecessors in sovereignty. I have understood that Villa is now\r\npractising medicine in Manila. More than one officer of the American\r\narmy that I know, afterwards did things to the Filipinos almost\r\nas cruel as Villa did to that unhappy Spanish officer, Lieutenant\r\nPiera. On the whole, I think President Roosevelt acted wisely and\r\nhumanely in wiping the slate. We had new problems to deal with, and\r\nwere not bound to handicap ourselves with the old ones left over from\r\nthe Spanish regime.\r\n\r\nIt appears that Villa became a little suspicious of the travellers. He\r\ndetained them at Carig seven days. Finally there came a telegram from\r\nhis chief at Aparri, Colonel Tirona, to our two travellers, which read:\r\n\"I salute you affectionately, and authorize Villa to accompany you to\r\nIligan.\" At Iligan, the capital of Isabela province, the travellers\r\nwere lavishly entertained. They were given a grand baile (ball) and\r\nfiesta (feast), a kind of dinner-dance, we would call it. To the light\r\nMessrs. Sargent and Wilcox throw on the then universal acknowledgment\r\nof the authority of the Aguinaldo government, and the perfect\r\ntranquillity and public order maintained under it, in the Cagayan\r\nvalley, I may add that as judge of that district in 1901-2 there came\r\nbefore me a number of cases in the trial of which the fact would be\r\nbrought out of this or that difference among the local authorities\r\nhaving been referred to the Malolos Government for settlement. And\r\nthey always waited until they heard from it. The doubting Thomas will\r\nattribute this to the partiality of the Filipinos to procrastination\r\nin general. I know it was due to the hearty co-operation of the\r\npeople with, and their loyalty to, the then existing government,\r\nand to their pride in it. Mr. Sargent tells a characteristic story\r\nof Villa, whose vengeful feeling toward the Spaniards showed on all\r\noccasions. The former Spanish governor of the province was of course\r\na prisoner in Villa's custody. Villa had the ex-governor brought in,\r\nfor the travellers to see him, and remarked, in his presence to them,\r\n\"This is the man who robbed this province of $25,000 during the last\r\nyear of his office.\" From Iligan our travellers proceeded to Aparri,\r\ncordially received everywhere, and finding the country in fact, as\r\nAguinaldo always claimed in his proclamations of that period seeking\r\nrecognition of his government by the Powers, in a state of profound\r\npeace and tranquillity--free from brigandage and the like. At Aparri\r\nthe visitors were cordially welcomed by Colonel Tirona, and much\r\nfeted. While they were there, Tirona transferred his authority to a\r\ncivil regime. Says Paymaster Wilcox:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The steamer Saturnus, which had left the harbor the day before\r\n    our arrival, brought news from Hong Kong papers that the Senators\r\n    from the United States at the Congress at Paris favored the\r\n    independence of the islands with an American protectorate. Colonel\r\n    Tirona considered the information of sufficient reliability to\r\n    justify him in regarding Philippine Independence as assured,\r\n    and warfare in the Islands at an end.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to describe the inauguration of civil government\r\nin Cagayan province. I hope all this will not weary the American\r\nreader. It was vividly interesting to me when I read it for the first\r\ntime thirteen years afterward, in 1911, because it was such unexpected\r\ninformation, so surprising. It will be equally interesting to all other\r\nAmericans who participated in putting down the subsequent insurrection\r\nand in setting up the Taft civil government in that same valley three\r\nyears later. I was in that town, for a similar purpose, with Governor\r\nTaft in 1901, after a bloody war which almost certainly would not\r\nhave occurred had the Paris Peace Commission known the conditions then\r\nexisting, just like this, all over Luzon and the Visayan Islands. Of\r\ncourse the Southern Islands were a little slower. But as Luzon goes,\r\nso go the rest. The rest of the archipelago is but the tail to the\r\nLuzon kite. Luzon contains 4,000,000 of the 8,000,000 people out there,\r\nand Manila is to the Filipino people what Paris is to the French and to\r\nFrance. Luzon is about the size of Ohio, and the other six islands that\r\nreally matter, [138] are in size mere little Connecticuts and Rhode\r\nIslands, and in population mere Arizonas or New Mexicos. Describing\r\nthe ceremonies of the inauguration of civil government in Cagayan,\r\nthe Wilcox-Sargent report to Admiral Dewey says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Presidentes of all the towns in the province were present at\r\n    the ceremony. * * * Colonel Tirona made a short speech. * * * He\r\n    then handed the staff of office to the man who had been elected\r\n    \"Jefe Provincial\" [Governor of the Province]. This officer also\r\n    made a speech in which he thanked the military forces * * * and\r\n    assured them that the work they had begun would be perpetuated\r\n    by the people, where every man, woman, and child stood ready to\r\n    take up arms to defend their newly won liberty and to resist with\r\n    the last drop of their blood the attempt of any nation whatever\r\n    to bring them back to their former state of dependence. He then\r\n    knelt, placed his hand on an open Bible, and took the oath of\r\n    office. [139]\r\n\r\n\r\nDoes not such language in an official report made by officers of\r\nthe navy to Admiral Dewey in November, 1898, show an undercurrent\r\nof deep feeling at the position the Administration had put Admiral\r\nDewey in with Aguinaldo, when it decided to take the Philippines,\r\nand accordingly sent out an army whose generals ignored his protege?\r\n\r\nThe speech of the provincial governor was followed, says the\r\nWilcox-Sargent report (same page) by speeches from \"the other\r\nofficers who constitute the provincial government, the heads of\r\nthe three departments--justice, police, and internal revenue. Every\r\ntown in this province has the same organization.\" Article III. of\r\nAguinaldo's decree of June 18th, previous, providing an organic\r\nlaw or constitution for his provisional government (see Chapter\r\nII., ante) had provided precisely the organization which Wilcox\r\nand Sargent thus saw working at Aparri and throughout the Cagayan\r\nvalley in October, 1898. The importance of all this to the question\r\nof how the Filipinos feel toward us to-day, in this year of grace,\r\n1912, and to the element of righteousness there is in that feeling,\r\nis too obvious to need comment. Americans interested in business in\r\nthe Philippines come back to this country from time to time and give\r\nout interviews in the papers declaring that the Filipinos do not want\r\nindependence. What they really mean is that it makes no difference\r\nwhether they want it or not, they are not going to get it. And it\r\nis precisely these Americans, and their business associates in the\r\nUnited States, who have gotten through Congress the legislation which\r\nenables them to give the Filipino just half of what he got ten years\r\nago for his hemp, and other like legislation, and the Filipinos\r\nknow it. The gulf in the Philippines between the dominant and the\r\nsubject race will continue to widen as the years go by, so long as\r\nindirect taxation without representation continues to be perpetrated\r\nat Washington for the benefit of special interests having a powerful\r\nlobby. If the American people themselves are groaning under this very\r\nsort of thing, and apparently unable to help themselves, what is the a\r\npriori probability as to our voteless and therefore defenceless little\r\nbrown brother. Like the sheep before the shearer, he is dumb. But to\r\nreturn to our travellers and their journey.\r\n\r\n\r\n    A Norwegian steamer came into port [meaning the harbor of Aparri]\r\n    that afternoon, and this seemed our only hope. She was chartered by\r\n    two Chinamen * * *. At first they refused us permission to embark,\r\n    and declined to put in at any port on the west coast. No sooner\r\n    was this related to Colonel Tirona than he sent notice that the\r\n    ship could not clear without taking us and making a landing where\r\n    we desired. This argument was convincing.\r\n\r\n\r\nColonel Tirona provided them with a letter addressed to Colonel\r\nTino at Vigan, the chief town of the west coast of Luzon and the\r\ncapital of the province of Ilocos Sur, which province fronts the China\r\nSea. Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent proceeded aboard the Norwegian steamer\r\nfrom Aparri westward, doubling the northwest corner of Luzon, and\r\nsteaming thence due south to the nearest port. Vigan was the Filipino\r\nmilitary headquarters of the western half of northern Luzon, just as\r\nAparri was at the same time of the eastern half. On the west coast\r\nthe travellers were treated always courteously, but with considerable\r\nsuspicion. The explanation is easy. That region is in closer touch\r\nwith Manila, and with what is going on and may be learned at the\r\ncapital, than is the Cagayan valley which our tourists had just\r\nleft. They bade the commanding officer at Vigan good-bye, November\r\n13, 1898. Passing south through Namacpacan (which the command I was\r\nwith took a year or so later), they came to San Fernando de Union,\r\nsome twenty miles farther south along the coast road. Here they met\r\nColonel Tino and presented their letter from Tirona. He gave them a\r\ndinner, of course. How a Filipino does love to entertain, and make\r\nyou enjoy yourself! Talk about your \"true Southern hospitality\"! You\r\nget it there. \"Speeches were made, and great things promised by\r\nthe Philippine republic in the near future\" says Mr. Wilcox. After\r\nthe dinner and speech-making came the inevitable dance. After that\r\nColonel Tino started them off on their journey southward toward Manila\r\nduly provided with carriages. Passing Aringay on November 18, 1898\r\n[140] our travellers finally reached Dagupan, the northern terminus\r\nof the Manila-Dagupan Railway, and there took a train for Manila,\r\n120 miles away.\r\n\r\nIn his report covering the fall of 1898, General Otis always scoldingly\r\nsays of the Filipinos that in all the parleyings of his commissioners\r\nwith Aguinaldo's commissioners before the outbreak, the latter never\r\ndid know what they really wanted. The truth was they believed the\r\nAmericans were going to do with them exactly as every other white\r\nrace they knew of had done with every other brown race they knew of,\r\nbut they did not tell General Otis so. Mr. Wilcox, a more friendly\r\nwitness of that same period states their position thus at page twenty\r\nof the report to Admiral Dewey: \"They desire the protection of the\r\nUnited States at sea, but fear any interference on land.\" \"On one\r\npoint they seemed united, viz., that whatever our government may have\r\ndone for them, it had not gained the right to annex them,\" adding, in\r\nrelation to the physical preparations to make good this contention,\r\nin the event of war, \"The Philippine Government has an organized\r\nforce in every province we visited.\"\r\n\r\nThe whole tone of the Wilcox-Sargent report and the subsequent\r\nWilcox book is an implied reiteration, after intimate, extended,\r\nand friendly contact with the people of all Luzon north of the Pasig\r\nRiver, of Admiral Dewey's telegram sent to the Navy Department, June\r\n23, 1898: \"The people are far superior in intelligence and capacity\r\nfor self-government to the people of Cuba and I am familiar with both\r\nraces.\" In fact Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent do not raise the question of\r\n\"capacity for self-government\" at all, any more than Commodore Perry\r\ndid when similarly welcomed in 1854 by the Japanese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TREATY OF PARIS\r\n\r\n                                No man can serve two masters.\r\n\r\n                                                        Matthew vi., 24.\r\n\r\n                Confine the Empire within those limits which\r\n                nature seems to have fixed as its natural bulwarks\r\n                and boundaries.\r\n\r\n                                                  Augustus Caesar's Will.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a tale of three cities, Paris, Washington, and Manila.\r\n\r\nArticle III. of the Peace Protocol signed at Washington, August 12,\r\n1898, provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The United States will occupy and hold the city, bay, and harbor\r\n    of Manila, pending the conclusion of a Treaty of Peace which\r\n    shall determine the control, disposition, and government of the\r\n    Philippines. [141]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe \"Papers relating to the Treaty with Spain\" including the\r\ntelegraphic correspondence between President McKinley and our Peace\r\nCommissioners pending the negotiations, were sent to the Senate,\r\nJanuary 30, 1899, just one week before the final vote on the treaty,\r\nbut the injunction of secrecy was not removed until January 31,\r\n1901--after the presidential election of 1900. They then were\r\npublished as Senate Document 148, 56th Congress, 2d Session. It was\r\nnot until then that the veil was lifted. The instructions to the Peace\r\nCommissioners were dated September 16, 1898. The Commissioners were:\r\nWilliam R. Day, of Ohio, Republican, just previously Secretary of\r\nState, now (1912) Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates; Whitelaw Reid, Republican, then editor of the New York Tribune,\r\nnow Ambassador to Great Britain, and three members of the United States\r\nSenate, Cushman K. Davis, of Minnesota, William P. Frye, of Maine,\r\nRepublicans, and George Gray, of Delaware, Democrat. Senator Davis\r\ndied in 1900, and Senator Frye in 1911. Senator Gray has been, since\r\n1899, and is now, United States Circuit Judge for the 3d Judicial\r\nDistrict. Among other things, the President's instructions to the\r\nCommissioners said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is my earnest wish that the United States in making peace\r\n    should follow the same high rule of conduct which guided it in\r\n    facing war. * * * The lustre and the moral strength attaching\r\n    to a cause which can be confidently rested upon the considerate\r\n    judgment of the world should not under any illusion of the hour\r\n    be dimmed by ulterior designs which might tempt us * * * into an\r\n    adventurous departure on untried paths.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy elaborate rhetorical gradations, the instructions finally get down\r\nto this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Incidental to our tenure in the Philippines is the commercial\r\n    opportunity. * * * The United States cannot accept less than the\r\n    cession in full right and sovereignty of the island of Luzon.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough already noticed, we venture, in this connection, again to\r\nrecall that in the month previous (August, 1898) a gentleman high in\r\nthe councils of the Administration [142] declared in one of the great\r\nreviews of the period: \"We see with sudden clearness that some of the\r\nmost revered of our political maxims have outlived their force.\" Among\r\nthese \"revered maxims\" thus suddenly fossilized by his ipse dixit,\r\nMr. Vanderlip exuberantly includes the teachings of \"Washington's\r\nFarewell Address and the later crystallization of its main thought\r\nby President Monroe\"--the Monroe Doctrine, adding that in lieu of\r\nthese \"A new mainspring * * * has become the directing force * * *\r\nthe mainspring of commercialism.\"\r\n\r\nAs permanent chairman of the Philadelphia convention which renominated\r\nMr. McKinley for the Presidency thereafter, in 1900, Senator Lodge,\r\nspeaking of the issues raised by the Treaty of Paris, said: \"We make\r\nno hypocritical pretence of being interested in the Philippines solely\r\non account of others. We believe in Trade Expansion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Philanthropy and five per cent. go hand in hand,\" said Mr. Vanderlip's\r\nChief, Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage, about the same\r\ntime. Such was the temper of the times when the treaty was made.\r\n\r\nThe first meeting with the Spanish Commissioners took place at Paris,\r\nOctober 1st. The opening event of the meeting, the initial move of the\r\nSpaniards, is extremely interesting in the light of subsequent events,\r\nespecially in connection with the Iloilo Fiasco, hereinafter described\r\n(Chapter IX.).\r\n\r\n\"Spanish communication represents,\" says Judge Day's cablegram to\r\nthe President, [143] \"that status quo has been altered and continues\r\nto be altered to the prejudice of Spain by Tagalo rebels, whom it\r\ndescribes as an auxiliary force to the regular American troops.\"\r\n\r\nEven diplomacy, in a conciliatory communication limited to the obvious,\r\ncalled the Filipinos our allies.\r\n\r\nThe Spanish initial move was more immediately prompted by the fact\r\nthat in point of absolute astronomical time Manila, though captured\r\nwhen it was morning of August 13th there, was captured when it was\r\nevening of August 12th, at Washington, and the protocol was signed\r\nat Washington in the evening of August 12th. While this point was\r\nmaterial, because we had captured $900,000 in cash in the Spanish\r\ntreasury at Manila and much other property, the title to which, under\r\nthe laws of war between civilized nations, depended on just what\r\ntime it was captured, the matter was finally swallowed up and lost\r\nsight of in the agreement to give Spain a lump $20,000,000 for the\r\narchipelago. But the initial move had other aspects. In the event we\r\nshould take the Philippines off her hands, Spain was going to insist\r\nthat we should get back from the Filipinos, our \"allies,\" and restore\r\nto her all the Spaniards they captured after August 12th. She knew\r\nthat in all probability if we bought the Islands we would be buying\r\nan insurrection, and she was \"taking care of her own\" at our expense.\r\n\r\nThe next feature of the proceedings entitled to attention in a\r\nbird's-eye view like this, concerns the question whether we should\r\ntake only Luzon, or the whole archipelago. President McKinley cabled\r\nAdmiral Dewey on August 13th, the day after the protocol was signed,\r\nasking as to \"the desirability of the several islands,\" \"coal and\r\nother mineral deposits,\" and \"in a naval and commercial sense which\r\n(of the several islands) would be most advantageous.\" [144] Admiral\r\nDewey had replied, of course, that Luzon was \"the most desirable,\"\r\nbut volunteered no advice. He did state, \"No coal of good quality can\r\nbe procured in the Philippine Islands,\" which is still true. Allusion\r\nis made to this telegram in the proceedings, but no copy of it is\r\nthere set forth. On October 4th, our Commissioners wired President\r\nMcKinley suggesting that he cable out to the Admiral and ask him\r\n\"whether it would be better * * * to retain Luzon * * * or the whole\r\ngroup.\" Mr. McKinley answered that he had asked Admiral Dewey before\r\nGeneral Merritt left Manila to give the latter his views in writing \"on\r\ngeneral question of Philippines,\" and that \"his report is in your hands\r\nin response to both questions.\" But the commission replied that Admiral\r\nDewey had sent only a copy of a report of General Francis V. Greene's\r\nand nothing else. There is no record of any further advice or opinion\r\nfrom Admiral Dewey on the point except that in General Otis's Report\r\n(p. 67) we get glimpses of a telegram that has never yet, apparently,\r\nbeen published, sent by Dewey to Washington early in December, 1898,\r\nsuggesting that we \"interfere as little as possible in the internal\r\naffairs of the Islands.\" No; Admiral Dewey must be acquitted of having\r\never counselled the McKinley Administration to buy the Philippines.\r\n\r\nOn October 7th the Commission telegraphed Washington that General\r\nMerritt attaches much weight to the opinion of the Belgian Consul at\r\nManila, M. Andre, and that \"Consul says United States must take all\r\nor nothing\"; that \"if southern islands remained with Spain they would\r\nbe in constant revolt, and United States would have a second Cuba\";\r\nthat \"Spanish government would not improve,\" and \"would still protect\r\nmonks in their extortion.\"\r\n\r\nTo this advice there was absolutely no answer. It was a case of \"all or\r\nnothing,\" and it had already become a case of \"all\" when on September\r\n16th previous Mr. McKinley signed his original instructions to the\r\nCommission stating \"The United States cannot accept less than Luzon.\"\r\n\r\nThe Commission's telegram of October 7th goes on to quote from the\r\nBelgian Consul's opinion that \"Present rebellion represents only one\r\nhalf of one per cent. of the inhabitants.\" The Consul was not before\r\nthem in person. They were quoting from a memorandum submitted by him\r\nto General Merritt at Merritt's request, made at Manila and dated\r\nAugust 29th, the day General Merritt sailed away from Manila bound\r\nfor Paris via the Suez Canal. He had brought the memorandum along\r\nwith him. From the previous chapters the reader will, of course,\r\nunderstand that Americans and Europeans at Manila in August, 1898,\r\nwere paying very little attention to Aguinaldo and his claims as to\r\nthe extent of his authority in the provinces. It is therefore not\r\nsurprising that M. Andre's memorandum of August 29th should have made\r\nthe foolish statement, \"Present rebellion represents only one half of\r\none per cent. of inhabitants.\" But it is eternally regrettable that his\r\nstatement on this point had any weight with the Commissioners, for it\r\nwas, or by that time at least (October 7th) had become, just about 99\r\n1/2 per cent. wide of the mark. As a matter of fact, by October 7th\r\nit would have been more accurate to have said, in lieu of the above,\r\n\"Present rebellion represents practically whole people.\" You see,\r\nwe started an insurrection in May, in October it had become a full\r\ngrown affair, and in December we bought it. The telegram of October\r\n7th also quoted General Merritt as saying, \"Insurgents would be\r\nvictorious unless Spaniards did better in future than in past,\"\r\nand as considering it \"feasible for United States to take Luzon\r\nand perhaps some adjacent islands and hold them as England does her\r\ncolonies.\" These are about the only two sound suggestions General\r\nMerritt made to that Commission. In the next breath they quote him as\r\nsaying, \"Natives could not resist 5000 troops.\" The fact that they\r\ndid resist more than 120,000 troops, that it took more than that,\r\nall told, to put down the insurrection, is sufficient to show how\r\nmuch General Merritt's advice was worth. He was right on two points,\r\nas indicated. Both Spanish fleets had been destroyed and Spain had but\r\none left to protect her home coast cities. The death knell of her once\r\nproud colonial empire had sounded. Decrepit as she was, she could not\r\npossibly have sent any reinforcements to the Philippines. Besides the\r\nFilipinos would have \"eaten them up.\" General Merritt's suggestion to\r\n\"hold them as England does her colonies\" was also sensible. In fact\r\nthat was the only thoroughly honest thing to have done, if we were\r\ngoing to take them at all. England never acts the hypocrite with her\r\ncolonies. She makes them behave. She does not let native people preach\r\nsedition in native newspapers, because of \"sentimental bosh\" about\r\nfreedom of the press, until the whole country becomes a smouldering\r\nhot-bed of sedition. She has blown offending natives from the cannon's\r\nmouth, when deemed necessary to cure them and their country of the\r\ndesire for independence. If we are going to have colonies at all, we\r\nought to govern them with the upright downright ruthless honesty of\r\nthe British. It is more merciful in the long run. But we ought not to\r\nhave colonies at all. For if there is one thing this republic stands\r\nfor, above all other things, it is the righteousness of aversion to\r\na foreign yoke.\r\n\r\nIn their telegram of October 7th, [145] the Peace Commissioners,\r\nnow squarely confronted with the question of forcible annexation,\r\nbegin to let the Administration down easy. They say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    General Anderson in correspondence with Aguinaldo in June and\r\n    July seemed to treat him and his forces as allies and native\r\n    authorities, but subsequently changed his tone. Merritt and Dewey\r\n    both kept clear of any compromising communications.\r\n\r\n\r\nA despatch sent by Judge Day certainly comes from high authority. The\r\nword \"compromising\" is therefore important. To say that Admiral\r\nDewey did not treat Aguinaldo as an ally is to raise a mere technical\r\npoint. But Aguinaldo never did get anything from him in writing. What\r\nhe got consisted more of deeds than words. And actions speak louder\r\nthan words. We had an alliance with Aguinaldo, a most \"compromising\"\r\nalliance and afterwards repudiated it. Admiral Dewey made it and\r\nGeneral Merritt repudiated it. Dewey did, without the President's\r\nknowledge, exactly what the President and the American people would\r\nhave had him do at the time. And Merritt did exactly what the President\r\nordered him to do. But between the making of the alliance, and the\r\nrepudiation of it, the President and the American people changed their\r\nminds. I say the American people, because they afterwards ratified\r\nall that Mr. McKinley did. You see the bitterness that lies away down\r\nin the secret recesses of the hearts of the Filipino people to-day\r\nhas its source at this point. They had \"a gentleman's agreement,\"\r\nas it were, with us, not in writing, made at a time when the thought\r\nof a colony had never entered our minds. They fought in a common\r\ncause with us on the faith of that agreement--drove the Spaniards\r\ninto Manila in numerous victorious engagements involving much loss\r\nof life, on their part, keeping the Dons thereafter bottled up in\r\nManila on the land side while their \"ally\" Admiral Dewey was doing the\r\nsame on the sea side. The said Dons were living on horses and rats,\r\nand famine was imminent when our troops arrived and began to finish\r\nthe work of taking the beleaguered city. And then, having changed our\r\nminds and decided to annex the islands, we repudiated our \"gentleman's\r\nagreement,\" on the idea that the end justified the means. And the end,\r\nas it has turned out, did not even justify the means, seeing that the\r\nislands have proved a heavy financial liability instead of a profitable\r\nasset. Judge Day's telegram to Secretary Hay of October 12th (p. 27)\r\ncontains this curious and surprising passage as to Cuba:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Senator Gray in favor of accepting sovereignty unconditionally\r\n    * * * that we may thereby avoid future complications with Cubans,\r\n    claiming sovereignty while we are in process of pacifying island\r\n    * * * We desire instructions on this point.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe future of Cuba, however, trembled in the balance but for\r\na moment. Before \"the shell-burred cables\" had had time to quit\r\nvibrating with the question thus propounded, there came back this\r\nsplendidly clean-cut answer from the President:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We must carry out the spirit and letter of the resolution of\r\n    Congress [declaring war].\r\n\r\n\r\nIn characterizing Judge Gray's position, above indicated, as\r\n\"surprising,\" no reflection upon him is intended. On the contrary, such\r\na position, assumed by a man of such conceded intellectual probity,\r\nis illuminating as to the attitude subsequently taken concerning the\r\nPhilippines by the Democratic Senators who voted for the treaty. This\r\nattitude is stated by Senator Lodge, in his History of the War with\r\nSpain, with all the incisive forcefulness to which the country has so\r\nlong been accustomed in the public utterances of that distinguished\r\nman, and, seeing that no promise had been made, as in the case of\r\nCuba, Senator Lodge's statement of the position of those who voted\r\nfor the treaty should forever set at rest the stale injustice, still\r\noccasionally repeated, that Mr. Bryan, \"played politics\" in 1898-9 in\r\nurging his friends in the Senate to vote for its ratification. Says\r\nSenator Lodge (History of the War with Spain, p. 231):\r\n\r\n\r\n    The friends of ratification took the very simple ground that\r\n    the treaty committed the United States to no policy, but left\r\n    them free to do exactly as seemed best with all the islands;\r\n    that the American people could be safely entrusted with this\r\n    grave responsibility, and that patriotism and common sense alike\r\n    demanded the end of the war and the re-establishment of peace,\r\n    which could only be effected by the adoption of the treaty.\r\n\r\n\r\nOctober 14th, Washington wires the commission that Admiral Dewey has\r\njust cabled:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is important that the disposition of the Philippine Islands\r\n    should be decided as soon as possible. * * * General anarchy\r\n    prevails without the limits of the city and bay of Manila. Natives\r\n    appear unable to govern.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this cablegram the Admiral most unfortunately repeated as true some\r\nwild rumors then currently accepted by the Europeans and Americans\r\nat Manila which of course were impossible of verification. I say\r\n\"unfortunately\" with some earnestness, because it does not appear on\r\nthe face of his message that they were mere rumors. And, that they\r\nwere wholly erroneous, in point of fact, has already been cleared\r\nup in previous chapters, wherein the real state of peace, order and\r\ntranquillity which prevailed throughout Luzon at that time has been,\r\nit is believed, put beyond all doubt. But what manna in the wilderness\r\nto the McKinley Administration, now that it was bent on taking the\r\nislands, was that Dewey message of October 14th, \"The natives appear\r\nunable to govern\"!\r\n\r\nOn October 17th, Mr. Day wires Mr. Hay that the Peace Commissioners\r\nfeel the importance of preserving, so far as possible, the condition\r\nof things existing at the time of signing the protocol, to prevent\r\nany change in the status quo. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Might not our government * * * take more active and positive\r\n    measures than heretofore for preservation of order and protection\r\n    of life and property in Philippine Islands?\r\n\r\n\r\nHow could we, when Aguinaldo and his people were in the saddle all\r\nover Luzon, had taken the status quo between their teeth and run away\r\nwith it, and were prepared to fight if bidden to halt and dismount;\r\nand, which is more, were preserving order perfectly themselves?\r\n\r\nOn October 19th, Mr. Hay repeated by wire to Mr. Day a cablegram from\r\nGeneral Otis which said: \"Do not anticipate trouble with insurgents\r\n* * * Affairs progressing favorably.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis was making a desperate effort to humor Mr. McKinley's\r\n\"consent-of-the-governed\" theory and programme. But it was a situation,\r\nnot a theory, which confronted him.\r\n\r\nThe date of the high-water mark of the Paris peace negotiations is\r\nOctober 25th. On that day, Mr. Day wired Mr. Hay:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Differences of opinion among commissioners concerning Philippine\r\n    Islands are set forth in statements transmitted (by cable also)\r\n    herewith. On these we request early consideration and explicit\r\n    instructions. Liable now to be confronted with this question in\r\n    joint commission almost immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\nMessrs. Davis, Frye, and Reid, sent a joint signed statement. They\r\nurged taking over the whole archipelago, saying that, as their\r\ninstructions provided for the retention at least of Luzon, \"we do not\r\nconsider the question of remaining in the Philippine Islands as at\r\nall now properly before us.\" They also urged that as Spain governed\r\nand defended the islands from Manila, we became, with the destruction\r\nof her fleet and the surrender of her army, \"as complete masters of\r\nthe whole group as she had been, with nothing needed to complete the\r\nconquest save to proceed with the ample forces we had at hand to take\r\nunopposed possession.\" The vice of this proposition, from the strategic\r\nas well as the ethical point of view, is of course clear enough now.\r\n\r\nSpain's government was already tottering in the Philippines when the\r\nSpanish-American war broke out. To be \"as complete masters as she had\r\nbeen\" was like becoming the recipient of a quit-claim deed. Also, ours\r\nwas not a case of taking \"unopposed possession.\" An adverse claimant,\r\nrelying on immemorial prescription, was in full possession; all the\r\ntenants on the land had attorned to him, and he and they were ready to\r\ndefend their claim against all comers with their lives. They reminded\r\none of the recurrent small farmer whom some great timber or other\r\ncorporation seeks to oust, patrolling his land lines rifle in hand,\r\non the lookout for the corporation's agent and the sheriff with the\r\ndispossessory warrant.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Davis, Frye, and Reid go on to say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Military and naval witnesses agree that it would be practically\r\n    as easy to hold and defend the whole as a part.\r\n\r\n\r\nHardly any one can fail to read with interest the following accurate\r\nand vivid picture which they give of the physical strategic unity of\r\nthe Philippine Islands:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is hardly a single island in the group from which you cannot\r\n    shoot across to one or more of the others--scarcely another\r\n    archipelago in the world in which the islands are crowded so\r\n    closely together and so interdependent.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis explains also why the Filipino people are a people. Whenever\r\nthe American people understand that, they will give them their\r\nindependence, unless they get an idea that government of their people\r\nby their people for their people would be distasteful to them.\r\n\r\nIn the memorandum of their views telegraphed to Washington on October\r\n25th, Messrs. Davis, Frye, and Reid also say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Public opinion in Europe, including that of Rome, expects us to\r\n    retain whole of Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchbishop Chapelle was in Paris at the time of these negotiations. He\r\nafterwards told the writer in Manila that he got that $20,000,000 put\r\nin the Treaty of Paris. The Church preferred that our title should be\r\na title by purchase rather than a title by conquest, and Mr. McKinley\r\nwas vigorously urging the latter. Between the legal effects of the\r\ntwo, there is a world of difference. The Church outgeneralled the\r\nPresident--checkmated him with a bishop. Look at that part of the\r\ntreaty which affects church property:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Article VIII. The * * * cession * * * cannot in any respect impair\r\n    the property or rights * * * of * * * ecclesiastical * * * bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Church of Rome, or at least some of the ecclesiastical\r\nbodies pertaining to it in the Philippines, owned the cream of the\r\nagricultural estates. By the treaty they have not lost a dollar. It\r\nmight have been otherwise, had not Mr. McKinley's original claim of\r\ntitle by conquest been overcome at Paris.\r\n\r\nJudge Day's memorandum of his own views, telegraphed on October 25th\r\nalong with those of his colleagues, stated that he was unable to agree\r\nthat we should peremptorily demand the entire Philippine group; that\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the spirit of our instructions, and bearing in mind the often\r\n    declared disinterestedness of purpose and freedom from designs\r\n    of conquest with which the war was undertaken, we should be\r\n    consistent in demands in making peace * * * with due regard to\r\n    our responsibility because of the conduct of our military and\r\n    naval authorities in dealing with the insurgents.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We cannot leave the insurgents either to form a government [he of\r\n    course did not know what a complete government they had already\r\n    formed] or to battle against a foe which * * * might readily\r\n    overcome them.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe also was of course unaware how thoroughly anxious the Spaniards then\r\nin the Philippines were to get away, and how completely they were at\r\nthe mercy of the new Philippine Republic and its forces. \"On all hands\"\r\nsays Judge Day, \"it is agreed that the inhabitants of the islands are\r\nunfit for self-government.\" Of course we knew absolutely nothing worth\r\nmentioning about the Filipinos at that time. Judge Day then proposes,\r\nfor the reasons indicated, to accept Luzon and some adjacent islands,\r\nas being of \"strategic advantage,\" and to leave Spain the rest, with\r\na \"treaty stipulation for non-alienation without the consent of the\r\nUnited States.\" It seems to me that Judge Day's scheme was the least\r\ndesirable of all.\r\n\r\nSenator Gray's memorandum of the same date is a red-hot argument\r\nagainst taking over any part of the archipelago. He begins thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The undersigned cannot agree that it is wise to take Philippine\r\n    Islands in whole or in part. To do so would be to reverse\r\n    accepted continental policy of the country, declared and acted\r\n    upon through our history. * * * It will make necessary * * *\r\n    immense sums for fortifications and harbors * * * Climate and\r\n    social conditions demoralizing to character of American youth * * *.\r\n    On whole, instead of indemnity, injury * * *. Cannot agree that\r\n    any obligation incurred to insurgents * * *. If we had captured\r\n    Cadiz and Carlists had helped us, would not be our duty to stay by\r\n    them at the conclusion of war * * *. No place for * * * government\r\n    of subject people in American system * * *. Even conceding all\r\n    benefits claimed for annexation, we thereby abandon * * * the moral\r\n    grandeur and strength to be gained by keeping our word to nations\r\n    of the world * * * for doubtful material advantages and shameful\r\n    stepping down from high moral position boastfully assumed. * * *\r\n    Now that we have achieved all and more than our object, let us\r\n    simply keep our word * * *. Above all let us not make a mockery\r\n    of the [President's] instructions, where, after stating that we\r\n    took up arms only in obedience to the dictates of humanity * * *\r\n    and that we had no designs of aggrandizement and no ambition for\r\n    conquest, the President * * * eloquently says: \"It is my earnest\r\n    wish that the United States in making peace should follow the\r\n    same high rule of conduct which guided it in facing war.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day, October 26th, came this laconic answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cession must be of the whole archipelago or none. The latter\r\n    is wholly inadmissible and the former must be required.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the one thing about the Paris Peace negotiations that is\r\nsure to interest the average American most at this late date is the\r\nmatter of how we came to pay that twenty millions. It was this way. On\r\nOctober 27th, the Commission wired Washington:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Last night Spanish ambassador called upon Mr. Reid.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems they talked long and earnestly far into the night, trying to\r\nfind a way which would prevent the conference from resulting in sudden\r\ndisruption, and consequent resumption of the war. Mr. Reid made plain\r\nthe inflexible determination of the American people not to assume the\r\nCuban debt. The Ambassador said: \"Montero Rios [146] could not return\r\nto Madrid now if known to have accepted entire Cuban indebtedness,\"\r\nand asked delay to see \"if some concessions elsewhere might not be\r\nfound which would save Spanish Commissioners from utter repudiation at\r\nhome.\" There is no doubt that the talk we are now considering was a\r\n\"heart-to-heart\" affair, probably quite informal. Yet it is one of\r\nthe most important talks that have occurred between any two men in\r\nthis world in the last fifty years. Mr. Reid finally threw out a hint\r\nto the effect that as the preponderance of American public sentiment\r\nseemed rather inclined to retain the Philippines, \"It was possible,\"\r\nhe said, \"but not probable that out of these conditions the Spanish\r\nCommissioners might find something either in territory or debt [147]\r\nwhich might seem to their people at least like a concession.!\" [148]\r\n\r\nIt was the leaven of this hint that leavened the whole loaf. There\r\nwas doubtless much informal parleying after that, but finally, the\r\nAmerican Commissioners, having become satisfied that Spanish honor\r\nwould not be offended by an offer having the substance, if not the\r\nform, of charity, and being very tired of Spain's sparring for wind\r\nin the hope of a European coalition against us should war be resumed,\r\nsubmitted the following proposal:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Government of the United States is unable to modify the\r\n    proposal heretofore made for the cession of the entire archipelago\r\n    of the Philippine Islands, but the American Commissioners are\r\n    authorized to offer to Spain, in case the cession should be agreed\r\n    to, the sum of $20,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis alluring offer was accompanied with the stern announcement that\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upon the acceptance * * * of the proposals herein made * * *\r\n    but not otherwise, it will be possible * * * to proceed to the\r\n    consideration * * * of other matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, our Commissioners wired Washington:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the Spanish Commissioners refuse our proposition * * * nothing\r\n    remains except to close the negotiations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was very American and very final. Washington answered: \"Your\r\nproposed action approved.\"\r\n\r\nNovember 29th, Mr. Day wired Mr. Hay:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Spanish Commissioners at to-day's conference presented a definite\r\n    and final acceptance of our last proposition.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd that is how that twenty millions found its way into the treaty--not\r\nforgetting the prayers and other contemporaneous activities of\r\nArchbishop Chapelle.\r\n\r\nAfter the tremendous eight weeks' tension had relaxed, and before\r\nthe final reduction to writing of all the details, we see this dear\r\nlittle telegram, from Secretary of State Hay, himself a writer of note,\r\ncome bravely paddling into port, where it was cordially received by\r\nboth sides, taken in out of the wet, and put under the shelter of\r\nthe treaty:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Hay to Mr. Day: In renewing conventional arrangements do not\r\n    lose sight of copyright agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd here is the last act of the drama:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mr. Day to Mr. Hay, Paris, December 10, 1898: Treaty signed at\r\n    8.50 this evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n    Prometheus stole the heavenly fire from the altar of Jupiter to\r\n    benefit mankind, and Jupiter thereupon punished both Prometheus\r\n    and the rest of mankind by creating and giving to them the woman\r\n    Pandora, a supposed blessing but a real curse. Pandora brought\r\n    along a box of blessings, and when she opened it, everything flew\r\n    out and away but Hope.\r\n\r\n                                                    Tales from AEschylus.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ever-memorable Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation, the Pandora\r\nbox of Philippine woes, was signed December 21, 1898, and its contents\r\nwere let loose in the Philippines on January 1, 1899.\r\n\r\nLet us consider for a moment the total misapprehension of conditions\r\nin the islands under which Mr. McKinley drafted and signed that famous\r\ndocument--a misapprehension due to General Otis's curious blindness\r\nto the great vital fact of the situation, viz., that the Filipinos\r\nwere bent on independence from the first, and preparing to fight\r\nfor it to the last. Take the following Otis utterance, for example,\r\nconcerning a date when practically everybody in the Eighth Army Corps,\r\nand every newspaper correspondent in the Philippines, recognized that\r\nwar would be certain in the event the Paris Peace negotiations should\r\nresult, as common rumor then said they would result, in our taking\r\nover the islands:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My own confidence at this time in a satisfactory solution of\r\n    the difficulties which confronted us may be gathered from a\r\n    despatch sent to Washington on December 7th, wherein I stated\r\n    that conditions were improving, and that there were signs of\r\n    revolutionary disintegration. [149]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that, at the date of that despatch, General\r\nOtis had been given to understand that under the Treaty of Paris\r\nwe were going to keep the islands if the treaty should be ratified,\r\nand also that the if might give the Administration trouble, should\r\ntrouble arise with the Filipinos before the if was disposed of at\r\nhome. As heretofore intimated, in addition to his preference for\r\nlegal and administrative work to the work of his profession, in the\r\nPhilippines General Otis constituted himself from the beginning a\r\npolitical henchman. Ample evidence will be introduced later on to\r\nshow beyond all doubt that all through the early difficulties, when\r\nthe American people should have been frankly dealt with and given the\r\nfacts, General Otis would, in the exercise of his military powers\r\nas press censor, always say to the war correspondents, \"I will let\r\nnothing go that will hurt the Administration.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see what the real facts of the Philippine situation were at\r\nthe date of the Treaty of Paris, December 10th, or, which is the same\r\nthing, when General Otis sent his despatch of December 7th. When\r\nthe Treaty of Paris was signed, General Otis was in possession of\r\nManila and Cavite, with less than 20,000 men under his command,\r\nand Aguinaldo was in possession of practically all the rest of the\r\narchipelago, with between 35,000 and 40,000 men under his command,\r\narmed with guns, and the whole Filipino population were in sympathy\r\nwith the army of their country. We have already seen the conditions\r\nin the various provinces at that time and also the inauguration of\r\nthe native central government. Let us now examine the military figures.\r\n\r\nTen thousand American soldiers were on hand when Manila was captured,\r\nAugust 13th, and 5000 more had arrived under command of Major-General\r\nElwell S. Otis a week or so after the fall of the city. [150] They had\r\n13,000 Spanish soldiers to guard. In addition to this, by the terms of\r\nthe capitulation, the city (population say 300,000), its inhabitants,\r\nits churches and educational establishments, and its private property\r\nof all descriptions had been placed \"under the special safeguard of\r\nthe faith and honor of the American army.\" [151] Some 4500 to 5000\r\nmore troops began to swarm out of San Francisco bound for Manila in\r\nthe latter part of October, 1898, the last of them reaching Manila\r\nDecember 11th, the day after the Treaty of Paris was signed. After\r\nthat there were no further additions to General Otis's command prior\r\nto the outbreak of war with the Filipinos, February 4, 1899. [151] Of\r\nthese (approximately) 20,000 men, only 1500 to 2000 were regulars,\r\nhaving the Krag-Jorgensen smokeless gun. The rest were State volunteers,\r\narmed with the antiquated Springfield rifles, the same the 71st New\r\nYork and the 2d Massachusetts had been permitted to carry into the\r\nSantiago campaign the summer before. Aguinaldo's people were equipped\r\nentirely with Mausers captured from the Spaniards, and other rifles,\r\nbought in Hong Kong mostly, using smokeless ammunition. Major (now\r\nMajor-General) J. F. Bell, who is, in the judgment of many, one of the\r\nbest all-round soldiers in the American army to-day, was in charge\r\nof the \"Division of Military Information\" at Manila both before and\r\nafter the taking of the city. General Bell has done many fine things,\r\nin the way of reckless bravery in battle at the critical moment and of\r\nbold reconnoitring in campaign, and what he fails to find out about\r\nan enemy, or a prospective enemy, is not apt to be ascertainable. In\r\na report bearing date August 29, 1898, [152] prepared in anticipation\r\nof possible trouble with the Filipinos, he estimated the number of\r\nmen under arms that Aguinaldo had at between 35,000 and 40,000. This\r\nestimate is based by General Bell in his report on the number of guns\r\nout in the hands of the Filipinos, which he figures thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Captured from Spanish militia                     12,500\r\n    From Cavite arsenal                                2,500\r\n    From Jackson & Evans (American merchants\r\n        trading with Hong Kong)                        2,000\r\n    From Spanish (captured in battle)                  8,000\r\n    In hands of Filipinos previous to May 1, 1898     15,000\r\n                                                      ------\r\n                            Total                     40,000\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this number General Bell deducts several thousands as having\r\nbeen recaptured by the Spaniards, or bought in. I at once hear some\r\nformer comrade-in-arms of the Philippine insurrection say: \"Oh,\r\nno. They couldn't have had as many as 40,000 guns, or near that.\" I\r\nthought the same thing when I first read General Bell's report on the\r\nmatter. But he removes the doubt thus: \"They are being continually\r\nsent away to other provinces.\"\r\n\r\nWe did not understand Aguinaldo's movements then. All his troops were\r\nnot around Manila. From what I learned from General Lawton and his\r\nstaff in 1899, my belief is that Aguinaldo had perhaps 30,000 men\r\nwith guns around Manila, and out along the railroad, at the time of\r\nthe outbreak of February 4th. It is idle, of course, at this late\r\ndate, to claim that the Filipinos were not bent on independence\r\nfrom the first. The matured plans of their leaders, formulated at\r\nHong Kong May 4, 1898, before they ever started the insurrection,\r\npreserved in the captured minutes of the meeting already noticed,\r\n[153] provide the programme to be adopted in the event we should be\r\ntempted to keep the islands. In that event, they were prepared against\r\nsurprise, or any necessity for making new plans, and were agreed to\r\naccept war as inevitable. From the first, they made ready for it.\r\n\r\nGovernmentally and strategically, the Philippine Islands, except\r\nMohammedan Mindanao, which is a separate and distinct problem,\r\nmay be described very simply and sufficiently as consisting of the\r\ngreat island of Luzon, on which Manila is situated, and the Visayan\r\ngroup. [154] We are already familiar with the conditions in Luzon in\r\nDecember, 1898. You hear a great deal about the Philippine archipelago\r\nconsisting of a thousand and one islands, but there are only eight\r\nthat are, broadly speaking, worth considering here. The moment a jagged\r\nsubmarine ledge peeps out of the water it becomes an island. And even\r\nbefore that it may wreck a ship. But we are talking about islands\r\nthat need to be charted on the sea of world politics. The Visayan\r\nIslands that really count at all in a great problem such as that we\r\nare now considering, are but six in number: Panay, capital Iloilo;\r\nCebu, capital Cebu; Bohol, Negros, Samar, and Leyte. [155] Iloilo is\r\nsome three hundred and odd miles south of Manila, and, besides being\r\nthe capital of Panay, is the chief port of the Visayas and the second\r\ncity of the archipelago, Cebu being the third. Under the Spaniards,\r\nas now under us, a vessel might clear from either of these places\r\nfor any part of the world. As we saw in the chapter preceding this,\r\nas early as November 18th, Admiral Dewey had cabled Washington that\r\nthe entire island of Panay was in possession of insurgents, except\r\nIloilo. By the end of December, all the Spanish garrisons in the\r\nVisayan Islands had surrendered to the insurgents. (Otis's Report,\r\np. 61.) Iloilo did not surrender to the insurgents until the day\r\nbefore Christmas. But let us not anticipate.\r\n\r\nDecember 13th, General Otis received a petition for protection signed\r\nby the business men and firms of Iloilo (p. 54), sent of course\r\nwith the approval of the general commanding the imperilled Spanish\r\ngarrison. December 14th, he wired Washington for instructions as\r\nto what action he should take on this petition, saying, among other\r\nthings, \"Spanish authorities are still holding out, but will receive\r\nAmerican troops\"; and adding one of his inevitable notes of optimism as\r\nto the tameness of Filipino aspirations (at Iloilo) for independence:\r\n\"Insurgents reported favorable to American annexation.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis knew the Spanish troops were hard pressed by the\r\ninsurgents down at Iloilo, and eagerly awaited a reply. President\r\nMcKinley was then away from Washington, on a southern trip, to Atlanta\r\nand Macon, Georgia, and other points, and nobody at home was giving\r\nany thought to the Filipinos, while they were knocking successively\r\nat the gates of the various Visayan capitals, and receiving the\r\nsurrender of their Spanish defenders. It was getting toward the\r\nyuletide season. President McKinley was engaged, quite seasonably,\r\nin putting the finishing touches to the great work of his life,\r\nwhich was welding the North and the South together forever by wise\r\nand kindly manipulation of the countless opportunities to do so\r\npresented by the latest war. It was a season of general peace and\r\nrejoicing in a thrice-blessed land, and nobody in the United States\r\nwas looking for trouble with the Filipinos. With our people it was a\r\ncase of ignorance being bliss, so far as the Philippine Islands and\r\ntheir inhabitants were concerned. In his Autobiography of Seventy\r\nYears, Senator Hoar tells of an interview with President McKinley\r\nconcerning his (the Senator's) attitude toward the Treaty of Paris,\r\nearly in December, 1898. [156] \"He greeted me with the delightful and\r\naffectionate cordiality which I always found in him. He took me by the\r\nhand, and said: 'How are you feeling this winter, Mr. Senator?' I was\r\ndetermined there should be no misunderstanding. I replied at once:\r\n'Pretty pugnacious, I confess, Mr. President.' The tears came into\r\nhis eyes and he said, grasping my hand again: 'I shall always love\r\nyou whatever you do.'\"\r\n\r\nIt behooves this nation, and all nations, to consider those\r\ntears. They explain all the subsequent history of the Philippines\r\nto date. Mr. McKinley had proved himself a gallant soldier in his\r\nyouth, and he knew something of the horrors of war. He was also\r\none of the most amiable gentlemen that ever lived. But it is no\r\ndisrespect to his memory to say that while Mr. McKinley was a good\r\nman, Senator Hoar was his superior in moral fibre, and he knew it,\r\nand he knew the country knew it. He knew that Senator Hoar was going\r\nto fight the ratification of the treaty to the last ditch, speaking\r\nfor the Rights of Man and such old \"worn out formulae,\" and that his\r\nonly defence before the bar of history would have to rest on \"Trade\r\nExpansion,\" alias the \"Almighty Dollar.\" Those tears were harbingers\r\nof the coming strife in the Philippines. They were shed for such lives\r\nas that strife might cost. They were an assumption of responsibility\r\nfor such shedding of blood as the treaty might entail. The President\r\nreturned to Washington from his southern trip on December 21st, and\r\non December 23d (p. 55) cabled General Otis the following reply to\r\nhis request of December 14th for instructions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Send necessary troops to Iloilo, to preserve the peace and protect\r\n    life and property. It is most important that there should be no\r\n    conflict with the insurgents. Be conciliatory but firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Hoar had put Mr. McKinley on notice that he was going to\r\npresent the ethics of the case in the debate on the treaty. Congress\r\nhad gone home for the holidays, and after it re-assembled in January\r\nthe treaty would come up. The vote was sure to be close, and a too\r\nvigorous manifestation of belief on the part of the Filipinos that\r\nthis nation was not closing the war with Spain animated by \"the same\r\nhigh rule of conduct which guided it in facing war\" (Mr. McKinley's\r\ninstructions to the Peace Commissioners) might defeat the ratification\r\nof the treaty. Indeed, the final vote of February 6th, was so\r\nclose that the Administration had but one vote to spare. The final\r\nvote was fifty-seven to twenty-seven--just one over the necessary\r\ntwo-thirds. The smoke of a battle to subjugate the Filipinos might\r\n\"dim the lustre and the moral strength,\" as Mr. McKinley had expressed\r\nit in his instructions to the Peace Commissioners, of a war to free\r\nthe Cubans. Therefore there must be no trouble, at least until after\r\nthe ratification of the treaty. President McKinley had invented in\r\nthe case of Cuba a very catchy phrase, \"Forcible annexation would be\r\ncriminal aggression,\" and every time anybody now quoted it on him\r\nit tended to take the wind out of his sails. So benevolently eager\r\nwas that truly kind-hearted and Christian gentleman to avoid the\r\nappearance of \"criminal aggression\" that he evidently got to thinking\r\nabout that telegram of December 23d in which he had authorized General\r\nOtis to send troops to the relief of the beleaguered Spanish garrison\r\nat Iloilo, and also about the message from Admiral Dewey received\r\nNovember 18th previous, to the effect that the entire island of Panay\r\nexcept Iloilo was then already in the hands of the insurgents. The\r\nresult was that he decided not to let his conciliatory proclamation\r\nof December 21st await the slow process of the mails, and therefore,\r\nthough it consisted of something like one thousand words, he had it\r\ncabled out to General Otis in full on December 27th. It is now here\r\nreproduced in full because it precipitated the war in the Philippines,\r\nand is the key to all our subsequent dealings with them [157]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION PROCLAMATION\r\n\r\n    Executive Mansion, Washington,\r\n          December 21, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n    The destruction of the Spanish fleet in the harbor of Manila\r\n    by the United States naval squadron commanded by Rear-Admiral\r\n    Dewey, followed by the reduction of the city and the surrender\r\n    of the Spanish forces, practically effected the conquest of the\r\n    Philippine Islands and the suspension of Spanish sovereignty\r\n    therein. With the signature of the treaty of peace between the\r\n    United States and Spain by their respective plenipotentiaries at\r\n    Paris on the 10th instant, and as a result of the victories of\r\n    American arms, the future control, disposition, and government\r\n    of the Philippine Islands are ceded to the United States. In\r\n    the fulfilment of the rights of sovereignty thus acquired and\r\n    the responsible obligations of government thus assumed, the\r\n    actual occupation and administration of the entire group of the\r\n    Philippine Islands becomes immediately necessary, and the military\r\n    government heretofore maintained by the United States in the city,\r\n    harbor, and bay of Manila is to be extended with all possible\r\n    despatch to the whole of the ceded territory. In performing this\r\n    duty the military commander of the United States is enjoined to\r\n    make known to the inhabitants of the Philippine Islands that in\r\n    succeeding to the sovereignty of Spain, in severing the former\r\n    political relations, and in establishing a new political power, the\r\n    authority of the United States is to be exerted for the securing\r\n    of the persons and property of the people of the islands and for\r\n    the confirmation of all their private rights and relations. It\r\n    will be the duty of the commander of the forces of occupation to\r\n    announce and proclaim in the most public manner that we come not\r\n    as invaders or conquerors, but as friends, to protect the natives\r\n    in their homes, in their employments, and in their personal and\r\n    religious rights. All persons who, either by active aid or by\r\n    honest submission, co-operate with the Government of the United\r\n    States to give effect to these beneficent purposes will receive\r\n    the reward of its support and protection. All others will be\r\n    brought within the lawful rule we have assumed, with firmness\r\n    if need be, but without severity, so far as possible. Within the\r\n    absolute domain of military authority, which necessarily is and\r\n    must remain supreme in the ceded territory until the legislation\r\n    of the United States shall otherwise provide, the municipal laws\r\n    of the territory in respect to private rights and property and\r\n    the repression of crime are to be considered as continuing in\r\n    force, and to be administered by the ordinary tribunals, so far\r\n    as practicable. The operations of civil and municipal government\r\n    are to be performed by such officers as may accept the supremacy\r\n    of the United States by taking the oath of allegiance, or by\r\n    officers chosen, as far as practicable, from the inhabitants of\r\n    the islands. While the control of all the public property and\r\n    the revenues of the state passes with the cession, and while\r\n    the use and management of all public means of transportation\r\n    are necessarily reserved to the authority of the United States,\r\n    private property, whether belonging to individuals or corporations,\r\n    is to be respected except for cause duly established. The taxes\r\n    and duties heretofore payable by the inhabitants to the late\r\n    government become payable to the authorities of the United States\r\n    unless it be seen fit to substitute for them other reasonable rates\r\n    or modes of contribution to the expenses of government, whether\r\n    general or local. If private property be taken for military use,\r\n    it shall be paid for when possible in cash, at a fair valuation,\r\n    and when payment in cash is not practicable, receipts are to be\r\n    given. All ports and places in the Philippine Islands in the actual\r\n    possession of the land and naval forces of the United States will\r\n    be opened to the commerce of all friendly nations. All goods and\r\n    wares not prohibited for military reasons by due announcement\r\n    of the military authority will be admitted upon payment of such\r\n    duties and other charges as shall be in force at the time of their\r\n    importation. Finally, it should be the earnest wish and paramount\r\n    aim of the military administration to win the confidence, respect,\r\n    and affection of the inhabitants of the Philippines by assuring\r\n    them in every possible way that full measure of individual\r\n    rights and liberties which is the heritage of free peoples, and\r\n    by proving to them that the mission of the United States is one of\r\n\r\n    BENEVOLENT ASSIMILATION\r\n\r\n    substituting the mild sway of justice and right for arbitrary\r\n    rule. In the fulfilment of this high mission, supporting the\r\n    temperate administration of affairs for the greatest good of the\r\n    governed, there must be sedulously maintained the strong arm of\r\n    authority, to repress disturbance and to overcome all obstacles\r\n    to the bestowal of the blessings of good and stable government\r\n    upon the people of the Philippine Islands under the free flag of\r\n    the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n        William McKinley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words used in the foregoing proclamation which were regarded by\r\nthe Filipinos as \"fighting words,\" i. e., as making certain the long\r\nanticipated probability of a war for independence, are those which\r\nappear in italics. The rest of the proclamation counted for nothing\r\nwith them. They had been used to the hollow rhetoric and flowery\r\npromises of equally eloquent Spanish proclamations all their lives,\r\nthey and their fathers before them.\r\n\r\nIn suing to President McKinley for peace on July 22d, previous, the\r\nPrime Minister of Spain had justified all the atrocities committed\r\nand permitted by his government in Cuba during the thirty years'\r\nstruggle for independence there which preceded the Spanish-American\r\nWar by saying that what Spain had done had been prompted only by a\r\n\"desire to spare the great island from the dangers of premature\r\nindependence.\" [158]\r\n\r\nClearly, from the Filipino point of view, the United States was now\r\ndetermined \"to spare them from the dangers of premature independence,\"\r\nusing such force as might be necessary for the accomplishment of that\r\npious purpose.\r\n\r\nThe truth is that, Prometheus-like, we stole the sacred fire from the\r\naltar of Freedom whereupon the flames of the Spanish War were kindled,\r\nand gave it to the Filipinos, justifying the means by the end; and\r\n\"the links of the lame Lemnian\" have been festering in our flesh ever\r\nsince. The Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation was a kind of Pandora\r\nBox, supposed to contain all the blessings of Liberty, but when the\r\nlid was taken off, woes innumerable befell the intended beneficiaries,\r\nand left them only the Hope of Freedom--from us. Verily there is\r\nnothing new under the sun. It is written: \"Thou shalt not steal\"\r\nanything--not even \"sacred fire.\" There is no such thing as nimble\r\nmorality. The lesson of the old Greek poet fits our case. So also,\r\nindeed, do those of the modern sage, Maeterlinck, for the Filipinos\r\ncould have found their own Bluebird for happiness. The record of\r\nour experience in the Philippines is full of reminders, which will\r\nmultiply as the years go by, that, after all, every people have an\r\n\"unalienable right\" to pursue happiness in their own way as opposed to\r\nsomebody else's way. That is the law of God, as God gives me to see the\r\nright. Conceived during the Christmas holiday season and in the spirit\r\nof that blessed season and presented to the Filipino people on New\r\nYear's Day, received by them practically as a declaration of war and\r\nbaptized in the blood of thousands of them in the battle of February\r\n4th thereafter, the manner of the reception of this famous document,\r\nthe initial reversal and subsequent evolution of its policies, and\r\nall the lights and shadows of Benevolent Assimilation will be traced\r\nin the chapters which follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ILOILO FIASCO\r\n\r\n            The King of France with forty thousand men\r\n            Marched up the hill and then marched down again.\r\n\r\n                                                     Old English Ballad.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already seen how busily Aguinaldo occupied himself during\r\nthe protracted peace negotiations at Paris in getting his government\r\nand people ready for the struggle for independence which he early and\r\nshrewdly guessed would be ultimately forthcoming. General Otis was in\r\nno position to preserve the status quo. The status quo was a worm in\r\nhot ashes that would not stay still. The revolution was a snow-ball\r\nthat would roll. The day after Christmas, General Otis at last sent\r\nan expedition under General Marcus P. Miller to the relief of Iloilo,\r\nbut when it arrived, December 28th, the Spaniards had already turned\r\nthe town over to the insurgent authorities, and sailed away. When\r\nGeneral Miller arrived, being under imperative orders from Washington\r\nto be conciliatory, and under no circumstances to have a clash with\r\nthe insurgents, the Administration's most earnest solicitude being\r\nto avoid a clash, at least until the treaty of peace with Spain\r\nshould be ratified by the United States Senate, he courteously asked\r\npermission to land, several times, being refused each time. With\r\na request of this sort sent ashore January 1, 1899, he transmitted\r\na copy of the proclamation set forth in the preceding chapter. The\r\ninsurgent reply defiantly forbade him to land. Therefore he did not\r\nland--because Washington was pulling the strings--until after the\r\ntreaty was ratified. \"So here we are at Iloilo, an exploded bluff,\"\r\nwrote war correspondent J. F. Bass to his paper, Harper's Weekly.\r\n\r\nBy the time the treaty was ratified the battle of Manila of February\r\n4th had occurred, and the pusillanimity of self-doubting diplomacy\r\nhad given way to the red honesty of war. [159]\r\n\r\nAs was noticed in the chapter preceding this, by the end of December,\r\n1898, all military stations outside Luzon, with the exception of\r\nZamboanga, in the extreme south of the great Mohammedan island of\r\nMindanao near Borneo, had been turned over by the Spaniards to the\r\ninsurgents. When General Miller, commanding the expedition to Iloilo,\r\narrived in the harbor of that city with his teeming troop-ships and\r\nnaval escorts on December 28th, an aide of the Filipino commanding\r\ngeneral came aboard the boat he was on and \"desired to know,\" says\r\nGeneral Miller's report, [160] \"if we had anything against them--were\r\nwe going to interfere with them.\" General Miller then sent some of\r\nhis own aides ashore with a letter to the insurgent authorities,\r\nexplaining the peaceful nature of his errand. They at once asked if\r\nour people had brought down any instructions from Aguinaldo. Answering\r\nin the negative, General Miller's aides handed them his olive-branch\r\nletter. They read it and said they could do nothing without orders\r\nfrom Aguinaldo \"in cases affecting their Federal Government.\" The grim\r\nveteran commanding the American troops smoked on this for a day or\r\nso, and then asked a delegation of insurgents that were visiting his\r\nship by his invitation--they would not let him land, you see--whether\r\nif he landed they would meet him with armed resistance. The Malay\r\nreverence for the relation of host and guest resulted in an evasive\r\nreply. They could not answer. But after they went back to the city\r\nthey did answer. And this is what they wrote:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Upon the return of your commissioners last night, we * * *\r\n    discussed the situation and attitude of this region of Bisayas in\r\n    regard to its relations and dependence upon the central government\r\n    of Luzon (the Aguinaldo government, of course); and * * * I have\r\n    the honor to notify you that, in conjunction with the people,\r\n    the army, and the committee, we insist upon our pretension not\r\n    to consent * * * to any foreign interference without express\r\n    orders from the central government of Luzon * * * with which we\r\n    are one in ideas, as we have been until now in sacrifices. * * *\r\n    If you insist * * * upon disembarking your forces, this is our\r\n    final attitude. May God forgive you, etc.\"\r\n\r\n                                        Iloilo, December 30, 1898. [161]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis letter is recited in General Miller's report to be from \"President\r\nLopez, of the Federal Government of Visayas.\" General Miller then\r\nwrote Otis begging permission to attack on the ground that upon the\r\nsuccess of the expedition he was in charge of \"depends the future\r\nspeedy yielding of insurrectionary movements in the islands.\" War\r\ncorrespondent Bass, who was on the ground at the time, also wrote\r\nhis paper: \"The effect on the natives will be incalculable all over\r\nthe islands.\" But General Otis was trying to help Mr. McKinley nurse\r\nthe treaty through the Senate on the idea that there weren't going to\r\nbe any \"insurrectionary movements in the islands,\" that all dark and\r\nmisguided conspiracies of selfishly ambitious leaders looking to such\r\nimpious ends would fade before the sunlight of Benevolent Assimilation.\r\n\r\nCautioning Otis against any clash at Iloilo, Mr. McKinley wired January\r\n9th: \"Conflict would be most unfortunate, considering the present.\r\n* * * Time given the insurgents cannot injure us, and must weaken and\r\ndiscourage them. They will see our benevolent purpose, etc.\" [162]\r\n\r\nThe Iloilo fiasco did indeed furnish to the insurgent cause aid and\r\ncomfort at the psychologic moment when it most needed encouragement to\r\nbring things to a head. It presented a spectacle of vacillation and\r\nseeming cowardice which heartened the timid among the insurgents and\r\nstarted among them a general eagerness for war which had been lacking\r\nbefore. In one of his bulletins [163] to Otis, General Miller tells of\r\ntwo boats' crews of the 51st Iowa landing on January 5th, and being met\r\nby a force of armed natives who \"asked them their business and warned\r\nthem off,\" whereupon they heeded the warning and returned to their\r\ntransport. This regiment had then been cooped up on their transport\r\ncontinuously since leaving San Francisco November 3d, previous,\r\nsixty-three days. They were kept lying off Iloilo until January 29th,\r\nand then brought back to Manila and landed, after eighty-nine days\r\naboard ship, all idea of taking Iloilo before the Senate should act\r\nhaving been abandoned.\r\n\r\nThe Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation was received by cable in\r\ncipher, at Manila, December 29th, and as soon as it had been written\r\nout in long hand General Otis hurried a copy down to General Miller\r\nat Iloilo by a ship sailing that day, so that General Miller might\r\n\"understand the position and policy of our government.\" But he\r\nforgot to tell Miller to conceal the policy for the present. [164]\r\nSo the latter, on January 1st, not only sent a copy of it to the\r\n\"President of the Federal Government of Visayas,\" Mr. Lopez, [165]\r\nbut in the note of transmittal he \"asked,\" says his report, \"that they\r\npermit the entry of my troops.\" [166] What a fatal mistake! Here was\r\na proclamation representing all the \"majesty, dominion, and power\" of\r\nthe American Government, signed by the President of the United States,\r\nin terms asserting immediate, absolute, and supreme authority, and the\r\nnatives were \"asked\" if they would \"permit\" its enforcement. General\r\nMiller's report says that he also had the proclamation \"translated\r\ninto Spanish and distributed to the people.\" [167] \"The people laugh\r\nat it,\" he says. \"The insurgents call us cowards and are fortifying\r\nat the point of the peninsula, and are mounting old smooth-bore\r\nguns left by the Spaniards. They are intrenching everywhere,\r\nare bent on having one fight, and are confident of victory. The\r\nlonger we wait before the attack the harder it will be to put down\r\nthe insurrection.\" This is especially interesting in the light of\r\nPresident McKinley's justification of the wisdom of temporizing--on\r\nthe idea that delay would weaken the insurgents and could not hurt\r\nus. \"Let no one convince you,\" writes Miller to Otis on January 5th,\r\n\"that peaceful means can settle the difficulty here.\"\r\n\r\nThe appeal to Otis to permit commencement of operations was without\r\navail. Otis was the Manila agent of the Aldrich Old Guard in the\r\nSenate, in charge of the pending treaty. He would simply send the\r\ndisgusted Miller messages not to be hasty, assuring him that the\r\nfiring of a shot at Iloilo would mean the precipitation of general\r\nconflict about Manila and all over the place, and that this would\r\nbe \"most disappointing to the President of the United States, who\r\ncontinually urges extreme caution and no conflict.\" [168]\r\n\r\nThe Administration was counting senatorial noses at the time, and\r\nthat its anxiety was justified is apparent from the fact already\r\nnoted, that on the final vote whereby the treaty was ratified it had\r\nbut one vote to spare. So General Miller sat sunning himself on the\r\ndeck of his transport, and watching the insurgents working like ants\r\nat their fortifications, and vainly wishing his 2500 men could get\r\nashore at least long enough to stretch themselves a bit. John F. Bass,\r\ncorrespondent for Harper's Weekly, left Iloilo, returned to Manila,\r\nand wrote his paper on January 23d: \"I returned to Manila well knowing\r\nthat there was nothing more to be done in Iloilo until the Senate\r\nvoted on the Treaty of Peace.\"\r\n\r\nOn the eighth day after General Miller had asked permission of the\r\nIloilo village Hampdens to enforce the orders of the President of\r\nthe United States, the \"Federal Government of the Visayas,\" through\r\nits President, Senor Lopez, finally deigned to notice Mr. McKinley's\r\nproclamation. It said under date of January 9th:\r\n\r\n\r\n    General: We have the high honor of having received your message,\r\n    dated January 1st, of this year, enclosing letter of President\r\n    McKinley. You say in one clause of your message: \"As indicated in\r\n    the President's cablegram, under these conditions the inhabitants\r\n    of the island of Panay ought to obey the political authority of the\r\n    United States, and they will incur a grave responsibility if, after\r\n    deliberating, they decide to resist said authority.\" So the council\r\n    of state of this region of Visayas are, at this present moment,\r\n    between the authority of the United States, that you try to impose\r\n    on us, and the authority of the central government of Malolos.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen follows this remarkable statement of the case for the Filipinos:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The supposed authority of the United States began with the\r\n    Treaty of Paris, on the 10th of December, 1898. The authority of\r\n    the Central Government of Malolos is founded in the sacred and\r\n    natural bonds of blood, language, uses, customs, ideas, (and)\r\n    sacrifices. [169]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis was fond of throwing cold water on any particularly\r\neloquent Filipino insurrecto document he had occasion to put in\r\nhis reports by saying that Mabini was \"the brains of\" the Malolos\r\nGovernment--meaning the only brains it had [170]--and that he probably\r\nwrote such document, whatever it might be. But here is a piece of\r\nreal eloquence, originating away down in the Visayan Islands, as\r\nfar away from Malolos as Colonel Stark and his \"Green Mountain Boys\"\r\nwere from Washington and Hamilton in 1776 and after. What then is the\r\nexplanation of composition so forceful in its impassioned simplicity,\r\nand in the light of subsequent events, so pathetic? There is but\r\none explanation. It came from the heart. It was the cry of the Soul\r\nof Humanity seeking its natural affiliations. It was the language\r\nof what Aguinaldo's early state papers always used to call the\r\n\"legitimate aspirations of\" his people--legitimate aspirations which\r\nwe later strangled. The reason of the writer's earnestness is that a\r\nfew months later he helped do some of the strangling. Thirteen years\r\nafterwards, a thorough acquaintance with the Filipino side of the\r\nmatter, derived from an examination of the information which has been\r\ngradually accumulated and published by our government during that time,\r\ncauses him to say, \"Father forgive me, for I knew not what I did.\" The\r\n35,000 volunteers of 1899 knew nothing about the Filipinos or their\r\nside of the case. We were like the deputy sheriff who goes out with\r\na warrant duly issued to arrest a man charged with unlawful breach\r\nof the peace. It is not his business to inquire whether the man is\r\nguilty or not. If the man resists arrest, he takes the consequences.\r\n\r\nOn the second day after the above defiance of the President of the\r\nUnited States was served up to General Miller, that gallant officer\r\nhaving dutifully swallowed it, sent an officer ashore on a diplomatic\r\nmission. The name and rank of this military ambassador were Acting\r\nAssistant Surgeon Henry DuR. Phelan, who clearly appears to have been\r\na man of keen insight and considerable ability. His written report\r\nto General Miller of what transpired is a document of permanent\r\ninterest and importance to the annals of men's struggles for free\r\ninstitutions. [171] It states that at the meeting the spokesman\r\nof the Filipinos, Attorney Raimundo Melliza, began by saying that\r\n\"all the Americans owned was Manila.\" That was unquestionably true,\r\nso our ambassador, it seems, did not gainsay it. Dr. Phelan suggested\r\nthat the Americans had sacrificed lives and money in destroying the\r\npower of Spain. The spokesman, Attorney Melliza, replied that \"they\r\nalso had made great sacrifice in lives, and that they had a right to\r\ntheir country which they had fought for, and that we are here now to\r\ntake from them what they had won by fighting; that they had been our\r\nallies, and we had used them as such.\" Dr. Phelan's report goes on to\r\nsay: \"I replied that military occupation was a necessity for a time,\r\n* * * and that as soon as order was assured it would be withdrawn\r\n* * *. They smiled at this.\" Well they might. Fourteen years have\r\nelapsed since then, and the law-making power of the United States has\r\nnever yet declared whether the American occupation of the Philippine\r\nIslands is to be temporary, like our occupation of Cuba was, or\r\npermanent, like the British occupation of Egypt is. True, Dr. Phelan\r\nsaid \"military\" occupation, but the smile was provoked by the\r\nsuggestion of temporariness. After the committee smiled, they remarked:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have fought for independence and feel that we have the power\r\n    of governing and need no assistance. We are showing it now. You\r\n    might inquire of the foreigners if it is not so.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Phelan's report proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    They stated that their orders were not to allow us to disembark,\r\n    and that they were powerless to allow us to come in without\r\n    express orders from their government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regard to the Treaty of Paris, the spokesman, Lawyer Melliza, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    International law forbids a nation to make a contract in regard\r\n    to taking the liberties of its colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nLawyer Melliza was wrong. If he had said \"the law of righteousness,\"\r\ninstead of \"international law,\" his proposition, thus amended, would\r\nhave been incontrovertible. On September 19, 1911, one of the great\r\nnewspapers of this country, the Denver Post, sent out to the members\r\nof the Congress of the United States, and to \"The Fourth Estate\" also,\r\nthe newspaper editors, a circular letter proposing that we sell the\r\nPhilippine Islands to Japan. A member of the United States Senate\r\nsent this answer:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not favor your proposition. Selling the Islands means selling\r\n    the inhabitants. The question of traffic in human beings, whether\r\n    by wholesale or retail, was forever settled by the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the same time a leading daily paper of Georgia had an editorial\r\non the Denver Post's proposition, the most conspicuous feature of\r\nwhich was that Japan was too poor to pay us well, should we contemplate\r\nselling the Filipinos to her, so it was no use to discuss the matter\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nNo; Lawyer Melliza's proposition has no standing in international\r\nlaw yet. But it has with what Mr. Lincoln's First Inaugural called\r\n\"the better angels of our nature,\" if we stop to reflect.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting feature of the Phelan report to General Miller\r\nis the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I asked Lawyer Melliza if Aguinaldo said we could occupy the\r\n    city would they agree to it. He replied most emphatically that\r\n    they would.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time, in January, 1899, while the debate on the treaty was\r\nin progress in the United States Senate, there was hardly a province\r\nin that archipelago where you would not have encountered the same\r\ninflexible adherence to the Aguinaldo government.\r\n\r\nDr. Phelan's report closes thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At the conclusion of the meeting it was said that as this question\r\n    involved the integrity of the entire republic, it could not\r\n    be further discussed here, but must be referred to the Malolos\r\n    Government.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is one other statement made by the spokesman of the Filipinos,\r\nat their meeting with Dr. Phelan, which arrested and gripped my\r\nattention. That it may interest the reader as it did me, it will need\r\nbut a word or so as preface. In the fall of that same year, 1899,\r\nwhen my regiment, the 29th Infantry, U. S. Volunteers, reached the\r\nIslands, it was supposed that the insurrection had about played out,\r\ni.e., that it had been \"beaten to a frazzle,\" because the Filipinos no\r\nlonger offered to do battle in force in the open. Yet all that fall,\r\nand all through 1900 and after, a most obstinate guerrilla warfare\r\nwas kept up. Anywhere in the archipelago you were liable to be fired\r\non from ambush. At first we could not understand this. Later we found\r\nout it was the result of an order of Aguinaldo's, faithfully carried\r\nout, not to assemble in large commands, but to conduct a systematic\r\nguerrilla warfare indefinitely. We learned this by capturing a copy\r\nof the order, which was quite elaborate. Dr. Phelan's report says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I told him [Melliza] that the city was in our power, and that we\r\n    could destroy it at any time * * *. Lawyer Melliza replied that\r\n    he cared nothing about the city; that we could destroy it if we\r\n    wished * * *. \"We will withdraw to the mountains and repeat the\r\n    North American Indian warfare. You must not forget that.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLater, they did.\r\n\r\nOn January 15th, General Otis wrote General Miller [172] again\r\ncautioning him against any clash at Iloilo, and saying of conditions\r\nat Manila and Malolos: \"The revolutionary government is very anxious\r\nfor peaceful relations.\"\r\n\r\nThree days later Senator Bacon saw the situation with clearer vision\r\nfrom the other side of the world than General Otis could see it\r\nunder his nose, and said on the floor of the Senate on January 18th\r\nconcerning the conditions at Manila and Malolos:\r\n\r\n\r\n    While there is no declaration of war, while there is no avowal\r\n    of hostile intent, with two such armies fronting each other with\r\n    such divers intents and resolves, it will take but a spark to\r\n    ignite the magazines which is to explode. [173]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spark was ignited on February 4, 1899, by a sentinel of the\r\nNebraska regiment firing on some Filipino soldiers who disregarded\r\nhis challenge to halt, and killing one of them. War once on, General\r\nMiller was directed on February 10th, after he had lain in Iloilo\r\nharbor for forty-four days, to take the city. So at last he gave\r\nwritten notice to the insurgents in Iloilo demanding the surrender\r\nof the city and garrison \"before sunset Saturday, the 11th instant\"\r\nand requesting them to give warning to all non-combatants. [174]\r\nThereupon the insurgents set fire to the city and departed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nOTIS AND AGUINALDO (Continued)\r\n\r\n                A word spoken in due season, how good is it!\r\n\r\n                                                       Proverbs xv., 23.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter we saw the debut of the Benevolent Assimilation\r\nprogramme at Iloilo. We are now to observe it at Manila. General Otis\r\nsays in his report for 1899 [175]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    After fully considering the President's proclamation and the\r\n    temper of the Tagalos with whom I was daily discussing political\r\n    problems and the friendly intentions of the United States\r\n    Government toward them, I concluded that there were certain\r\n    words and expressions therein, such as \"sovereignty,\" \"right of\r\n    cession,\" and those which directed immediate occupation, etc.,\r\n    * * * which might be advantageously used by the Tagalo war party to\r\n    incite widespread hostilities among the natives. * * * It was my\r\n    opinion, therefore, that I would be justified in so amending the\r\n    paper that the beneficent object of the United States Government\r\n    would be clearly brought within the comprehension of the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, he published a proclamation as indicated, on January 4th,\r\nat Manila. In a less formal communication concerning this proclamation,\r\nviz., a letter to General Miller at Iloilo, General Otis comes to\r\nthe point more quickly thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    After some deliberation we put out one of our own which it was\r\n    believed would suit the temper of the people. [176]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only thing in the Otis proclamation specifically directed toward\r\nsoothing \"the temper of the people\" was a hint that the United\r\nStates would, under the government it was going to impose, \"appoint\r\nthe representative men now forming the controlling element of the\r\nFilipinos to civil positions of responsibility and trust\" (p. 69). And\r\nthis, far from soothing Filipino temper, was interpreted as an offer\r\nof a bribe if they would desert the cause of their country. The bona\r\nfides of the offer they did not doubt for a moment. In fact it caught\r\na number of the more timid prominent men, especially the elderly ones\r\nof the ultraconservative element preferring submission to strife. But\r\nthe younger and bolder spirits were faithful, many of them unto death,\r\nand all of them unto many battles and much \"hiking.\" [177]\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis's report goes on to tell how, about the middle of January,\r\nafter he had published his sugar-coated edition of the presidential\r\nproclamation at Manila, it then at last occurred to him that General\r\nMiller might have published the original text of it in full at Iloilo,\r\nand, \"fearing that,\" says he, \"I again despatched Lieut. Col. Potter to\r\nIloilo\"--evidently post-haste. But it appears that when the breathless\r\nPotter arrived, the lid was already off. The horse had left the stable\r\nand the door was open, as we saw in the preceding chapter. However,\r\nas the Otis report indicates in this connection (p. 67), copies of\r\nthe original McKinley proclamation, as published in full at Iloilo by\r\nGeneral Miller, were of course promptly forwarded by the insurgents at\r\nIloilo to the insurgent government at Malolos. So all that General Otis\r\ngot for his pains was detection in the attempt to conceal the crucial\r\nwords asserting American sovereignty in plain English. He tells us\r\nhimself that as soon as the Malolos people discovered the trick, \"it\r\n[the proclamation] became\"--in the light of the Otis doctoring--\"the\r\nobject of venomous attack.\" His report was of course written long after\r\nall these matters occurred, but its language shows a total failure\r\non the part of its author, even then, to understand the cause of the\r\nbitterness he denominates \"venom.\" This bitterness grew naturally\r\nout of what seemed to the Filipinos an evident purpose of the United\r\nStates to take and keep the Islands and an accompanying unwillingness\r\nto acknowledge that purpose, as shown by the conspicuous discrepancies\r\nbetween the original text of the proclamation as published at Iloilo\r\nby General Miller, on January 1st, and the modified version of it\r\ngiven out by General Otis at Manila on January 4th. \"The ablest of\r\nthe insurgent newspapers,\" says he (p. 69), \"which was now issued\r\nat Malolos and edited by the uncompromising Luna * * * attacked the\r\npolicy * * * as declared in the proclamation, and its assumption of\r\nsovereignty * * * with all the vigor of which he was capable.\" The\r\nnature of Editor Luna's philippics is not described by General Otis\r\nin detail, the only specific notion we get of them being from General\r\nOtis's echo of their tone, which, he tells us, was to the effect that\r\n\"everything tended simply to a change of masters.\" But in another part\r\nof the Otis Report (p. 163) we find an epistle written about that\r\ntime by one partisan of the revolution to another, whose key-note,\r\ngiven in the following extracts, was doubtless in harmony with the\r\nLuna editorials:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We shall not have them (Filipinos enough to conduct a decent\r\n    government) in 10, 20, or a 100 years, because the Yankees\r\n    will never acknowledge the aptitude of an \"inferior\" race to\r\n    govern the country. Do not dream that when American sovereignty\r\n    is implanted in the country the American office-holders will\r\n    give up. Never! If * * * it depends upon them to say whether the\r\n    Filipinos have sufficient men for the government of the country\r\n    * * * they will never say it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIs not the American who pretends that he would have done anything but\r\njust what the Filipinos did, had he been in their place, i.e., fought\r\nto the last ditch for the independence of his country, the rankest\r\nsort of a hypocrite? General Otis was a soldier, and his views may\r\nhave been honestly colored by his environment. But how at this late\r\ndate can any fair-minded man read the above extracts illustrative\r\nof the temper in which the Filipinos went to war with us without\r\nacknowledging the righteousness of the motives which impelled them?\r\n\r\nAguinaldo promptly met General Otis's proclamation of January 4th\r\nby a counter-proclamation put out the very next day, in which he\r\nindignantly protested against the United States assuming sovereignty\r\nover the Islands. \"Even the women,\" says General Otis (p. 70), \"in a\r\ndocument numerously signed by them, gave me to understand that after\r\nthe men were all killed off they were prepared to shed their patriotic\r\nblood for the liberty and independence of their country.\" General\r\nOtis actually intended this last as a sly touch of humor. But when\r\nwe recollect Mr. Millet's description (Chapter IV. ante) of the women\r\ncoming to the trenches and cooking rice for the men while the Filipinos\r\nwere slowly drawing their cordon ever closer about the doomed Spanish\r\ngarrison of Manila in July and August previous, fighting their way over\r\nthe ground between them and the besieged main body of their ancient\r\nenemies inch by inch, while Admiral Dewey blockaded them by sea,\r\nGeneral Otis's sly touch of humor loses some of its slyness. \"The\r\ninsurgent army also,\" he says (p. 70), \"was especially affected * * *\r\nand only awaited an opportunity to demonstrate its invincibility\r\nin war with the United States troops * * * whom it had commenced to\r\ninsult and charge with cowardice.\"\r\n\r\nThe benighted condition of the insurgents in this regard was directly\r\ntraceable to the Iloilo fiasco. It was that, principally, which made\r\nthe insurgents so foolishly over-confident and the subsequent slaughter\r\nof them so tremendous. Further on in his report General Otis says, with\r\nperceptible petulance, in summing up his case against the Filipinos:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The pretext that the United States was about to substitute itself\r\n    for Spain * * * was resorted to and had its effect on the ignorant\r\n    masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking of his own modified version of the Benevolent Assimilation\r\nProclamation, General Otis says (p. 76):\r\n\r\n\r\n    No sooner was it published than it brought out a virtual\r\n    declaration of war from, in this instance at least, the wretchedly\r\n    advised President Aguinaldo, who, on January 5th, issued the\r\n    following\r\n\r\n\r\n--giving the reply proclamation in full. No man can read the Otis\r\nreport itself without feeling that if he, the reader, had been playing\r\nAguinaldo's hand he would have played it exactly as Aguinaldo did. To\r\nGeneral Otis the government at Malolos--\"their Malolos arrangement,\" he\r\nused to call it--seemed quite an impudent little opera-bouffe affair,\r\n\"a tin-horn government,\" as Senator Spooner suggested in the same\r\ndebate on the treaty, in which he called his rugged and fiery friend\r\nfrom South Carolina, Senator Tillman, \"the Senator from Aguinaldo,\"\r\nand immediately thereafter, with that engaging frankness that always so\r\nendeared him to his colleagues on both sides of the Chamber, removed\r\nthe sting from the jest by admitting that neither he (Spooner),\r\nnor Tillman, nor anybody else in the United States, knew anything\r\nabout Aguinaldo or his government. But in the calmer retrospect of\r\nmany years after, we have seen, through the official documents which\r\nhave become available in the interval, that said government was in\r\ncomplete and effective control of practically the whole archipelago,\r\nand had the moral support of the whole population at a time when our\r\ntroops controlled absolutely nothing but the two towns of Manila and\r\nCavite. Therefore, when we read in the Aguinaldo proclamation such\r\nphrases as, \"In view of this, I summoned a council of my generals and\r\nasked the advice of my cabinet, and in conformity with the opinion of\r\nboth bodies I\" did so and so; \"My government cannot remain indifferent\r\nto\" this or that act of the Americans assuming sovereignty over the\r\nislands; \"Thus it is that my government is disposed to open hostilities\r\nif\" etc.; they do not sound to us so irritatingly bombastic as they\r\ndid to General Otis, distributed under his nose as the proclamation\r\ncontaining them at once was, by thousands, throughout a city of which\r\nhe was nominally in possession, but nine-tenths of whose 300,000\r\ninhabitants he was obliged to believe in sympathy with the insurgents.\r\n\r\n\"My government,\" says the Aguinaldo proclamation, \"rules the whole\r\nof Luzon, the Visayan Islands, and a part of Mindanao.\" Except as to\r\nMindanao, which cut absolutely no figure in the insurrection until well\r\ntoward the end of the guerrilla part of it, we have already examined\r\nthis claim and found by careful analysis that it was absolutely true\r\nby the end of December, 1898.\r\n\r\nAfter a rapid review of how he had been aided and encouraged in\r\nstarting the revolution against the Spaniards by Admiral Dewey, and\r\nthen given the cold shoulder by the army when it came, Aguinaldo's\r\nmanifesto says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was also taken for granted that the American forces would\r\n    necessarily sympathize with the revolution which they had managed\r\n    to encourage, and which had saved them much blood and great\r\n    hardships; and, above all, we entertained absolute confidence\r\n    in the history and traditions of a people which fought for its\r\n    independence and for the abolition of slavery, and which posed as\r\n    the champion and liberator of oppressed peoples. We felt ourselves\r\n    under the safeguard of a free people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat this statement also was authorized by the facts is evident from\r\nthe minutes of the Hong Kong meeting of May 4th, already noticed,\r\npresided over by Aguinaldo, and called to formulate the programme\r\nfor the insurrection he was about to sail for the Philippines to\r\ninaugurate, in which, after much discussion among the revolutionary\r\nleaders it was agreed that while they must be prepared for all possible\r\ncontingencies, yet,\r\n\r\n\r\n    if Washington proposes to carry out the fundamental principles\r\n    of its constitution, it is most improbable that an attempt will\r\n    be made to colonize the Filipinos or annex them. [178]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, the Aguinaldo proclamation of January 5th suggests with\r\na briefness which Filipino familiarity with the great mass of\r\nfacts already laid before the reader in the preceding chapters made\r\nappropriate, all the causes for which the Malolos Government was ready,\r\nif need be, to declare war, and winds up by boldly serving General\r\nOtis with notice that if the Americans try to take Iloilo and the\r\nVisayan Islands \"my government is disposed to open hostilities.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 9th President McKinley cabled out to General Otis asking\r\nif it would help matters to send a commission out to explain to\r\nthe Filipinos our benevolent intentions. This idea thus suggested\r\nmaterialized, a few weeks later, in the Schurman Commission, of which\r\nmore anon. The next day, January 10th, General Otis answered endorsing\r\nthe sending of \"commissioners of tact and discretion,\" and adding: [178]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Great difficulty is that leaders cannot control ignorant\r\n    classes. [179]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact the leaders were leading. They were not arguing\r\nwith the tide. They were merely riding the crest of it. Actually,\r\nGeneral Otis would have stopped \"The Six Hundred Marseillaise Who\r\nKnew How to Die\"--the ones whose march to Paris, according to Thomas\r\nCarlyle, inspired the composition of the French national air, \"The\r\nMarseillaise\"--and tried to parley with the head of the column on the\r\nidea of getting them to abandon their enterprise and disperse to their\r\nseveral homes. He also says, in the cablegram under consideration:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If peace kept for several days more immediate danger will have\r\n    passed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, he was holding off the calf as best he could pending\r\nthe ratification of the treaty. From the text itself, however, of\r\nGeneral Otis's report, it is clear enough, that even he was getting\r\nanxious to give the Filipinos a drubbing as soon as the treaty should\r\nbe safely passed. Referring to a message from the President enjoining\r\navoidance of a clash with the Filipinos he says (p. 80):\r\n\r\n\r\n    The injunction of his Excellency the President of the United\r\n    States to exert ourselves to preserve the peace had an excellent\r\n    effect upon the command. Officers and men * * * were restless\r\n    under the restraints * * * imposed, and * * * eager to avenge the\r\n    insults received. Now they submit very quietly to the taunts and\r\n    aggressive demonstrations of the insurgent army who continue to\r\n    throng the streets of the business portion of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee the lamb kick the lion viciously in the face, and observe the\r\nlion as he first lifts his eyes heavenward and says meekly: \"Thy\r\nwill be done. This is Benevolent Assimilation\"; and then turns them\r\nSenate-ward and murmurs: \"I cannot stand this much longer, kind\r\nsirs. Say when!\" The way war correspondent John F. Bass puts the\r\nsituation about this time in a letter to his paper, Harper's Weekly,\r\nwas this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jimmie Green [180] bites his lip, hangs on to himself, and finds\r\n    comfort in the idea that his time will come.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Aguinaldo's ultimatum of January 5th about fighting if we took\r\nIloilo, General Otis refrained from taking Iloilo, and continued to\r\ncommunicate with the insurgent chieftain, appointing commissioners\r\nto meet commissioners appointed by him. These held divers and sundry\r\nsessions, whose only result was to kill time, or at least to mark\r\ntime, while the Administration was getting the treaty through the\r\nSenate. The object of these meetings is thus set forth in the military\r\norder of January 9, 1899, appointing the Otis portion of the Joint\r\nHigh Parleying Board:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To meet a commission of like number appointed by General Aguinaldo,\r\n    and to confer with regard to the situation of affairs and to arrive\r\n    at a mutual understanding of the intent, purposes, aim, and desires\r\n    of the Filipino people and the people of the United States, that\r\n    peace and harmonious relations between these respective peoples\r\n    may be continued. [181]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe minutes of the first meeting of this board, prepared by the\r\nSpanish-speaking clerk or recorder, recite the above declared\r\npurpose verbatim, in all its verbosity, and then go on to say that\r\nour side asked\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the commissioners appointed by General Aguinaldo give\r\n    their opinion as to what were the purposes, aspirations, aims,\r\n    and desires of the people of the archipelago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next paragraph is almost Pickwickian in its unconscious terseness:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To this request the commissioners appointed by General Aguinaldo\r\n    made response that in their opinion the aspirations, purposes,\r\n    and desires of the Philippine people might be summed up in two\r\n    words \"Absolute Independence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course even General Otis does not reproduce this laconic answer\r\nas part of his petulant summing up of how little the Filipinos knew,\r\nbefore the outbreak of February 4th, as to what they really wanted. He\r\nmerely alludes to it as being of record elsewhere. It is one oL\r\nthe various pieces of jetsam and flotsam that have floated from the\r\nsea of those great events to the shores of government publications\r\nsince. The minutes of these meetings may be found among the hearings\r\nbefore the Senate Committee of 1902. [182]\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis's report complains that Aguinaldo's commissioners did not\r\nknow what they wanted, \"could not give any satisfactory explanation\"\r\nof the \"measure of protection\" they wanted, they having declared\r\nthat they would greatly prefer the United States to establish a\r\nprotectorate over them to keep them from being annexed by some other\r\npower. But he fails to state, which is a fact shown by the minutes of\r\nthe meeting of January 14 (p. 2721), that the Filipino commissioners\r\ndid say that this was a question which would only be reached between\r\ntheir government and ours when the latter should agree to officially\r\nrecognize the former. To quote their exact language, which is rather\r\nclumsily translated, they said: \"The aspiration of the Filipino\r\npeople is the independence with the restrictions resulting from the\r\nconditions which its government may agree with the American, when\r\nthe latter agree to officially recognize the former.\"\r\n\r\nIt is perfectly clear from the voluminous minutes of the proceedings\r\nthat the Filipinos were only seeking some declaration of the purpose\r\nof our government which would satisfy their people that the programme\r\nwas something more than a mere change of masters. \"They begged,\"\r\nsays General Otis (p. 82), \"for some tangible concession from the\r\nUnited States Government--one which they could present to the people\r\nand which might serve to allay excitement.\" General Otis of course had\r\nno authority to bind the government and so could make no promise. But\r\nthe day this Otis-Aguinaldo parleying board had its second meeting,\r\nJanuary 11th, and probably with no more knowledge of its existence\r\nthan the reader has of what is going on in the Fiji Islands at the\r\nmoment he reads these lines, Senator Bacon introduced in the United\r\nStates Senate some resolutions which were precisely the medicine the\r\ncase required and precisely the thing the Filipinos were pleading\r\nfor. These resolutions concluded thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That the United States hereby disclaim any disposition or\r\n    intention to exercise sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control over\r\n    said islands except for the pacification thereof, and assert their\r\n    determination when an independent government shall have been duly\r\n    erected therein entitled to recognition as such, to transfer to\r\n    said government, upon terms which shall be reasonable and just,\r\n    all rights secured under the cession by Spain, and to thereupon\r\n    leave the government and control of the islands to their people.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey were a twin brother to the Teller Cuban resolution which was\r\nincorporated into the resolution declaring war against Spain, being\r\nverbatim the same, except with the necessary changes of name, of\r\n\"islands\" for \"island,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOn January 18th, while the futile parleying board aforesaid was still\r\nfutilely parleying at Manila, Senator Bacon made an argument in the\r\nSenate in support of his resolution, whose far-sighted statesmanship,\r\nconsidered in relation to the analogies of its historic setting,\r\nmost strikingly reminds us of Burke's great speech on conciliation\r\nwith America delivered under similar circumstances nearly a century\r\nand a quarter earlier. After alluding to the naturalness of the\r\napprehension of the Filipinos \"that it is the purpose of the United\r\nStates Government to maintain permanent dominion over them,\" [183]\r\nSenator Bacon urged:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The fundamental requirement in these resolutions is that the\r\n    Government of the United States will not undertake to exercise\r\n    permanent dominion over the Philippine Islands. The resolutions\r\n    are intentionally made broad, so that those who agree on that\r\n    fundamental proposition may stand upon them even though they\r\n    may differ materially as to a great many other things relative\r\n    to the future course of the government in connection with the\r\n    Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSenator Bacon then quoted the following from some remarks Senator\r\nForaker had previously made in the course of the great debate on\r\nthe treaty:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not understand anybody to be proposing to take the Philippine\r\n    Islands with the idea and view of permanently holding them.\r\n    * * * The President of the United States does not, I know, and no\r\n    Senator in this chamber has made any such statement;\r\n\r\n\r\nand added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the views expressed by the learned Senator from Ohio in\r\n    his speech * * * are those upon which we are to act, there is\r\n    very little difference between us; and there will be no future\r\n    contention between us * * * if we can have an authoritative\r\n    expression from The Law-Making Power of the United States in a\r\n    joint resolution that such is the purpose of the future. [184]\r\n\r\n\r\nSays the Holy Scripture: \"A word spoken in season, how good is it!\"\r\nHad the Bacon resolutions passed the United States Senate in January,\r\n1899, we never would have had any war with the Filipinos. [185]\r\nThey would have presented at the psychologic moment the very thing\r\nthe best and bravest of the Filipino leaders were then pleading\r\nwith General Otis for, something \"tangible,\" something \"which they\r\ncould present to their people and which would allay excitement,\"\r\nby allaying the universal fear that we were going to do with them\r\nexactly as all other white men they had ever heard of had done with\r\nall other brown men they had ever heard of under like circumstances,\r\nviz., keep them under permanent dominion with a view of profit.\r\n\r\nIn his letter accepting the nomination for the Presidency in 1900,\r\nMr. McKinley sought to show the Filipinos to have been the aggressors\r\nin the war by a reference to the fact that the outbreak occurred\r\nwhile the Bacon resolution was under discussion in the Senate. This\r\nhardly came with good grace from an Administration whose friends in\r\nthe Senate had all along opposed not only the Bacon resolution but\r\nalso all other resolutions frankly declaratory of the purpose of our\r\ngovernment. The supreme need of the hour then was, and the supreme\r\nneed of every hour of every day we have been in the Philippines since\r\nhas been, \"an authoritative expression from the law-making power of\r\nthe United States\"--not mere surmises of a President, confessedly\r\ndevoid of binding force, but an authoritative expression from the\r\nlaw-making power, declaratory of the purpose of our government with\r\nregard to the Philippine Islands. Secretary of War Taft visited Manila\r\nin 1907 to be present at the opening of the Philippine Assembly. In\r\nview of the universal longing which he knew existed for some definite\r\nauthoritative declaration as to whether our government intends to\r\nkeep the Islands permanently or not, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I cannot speak with authority * * *. The policy to be pursued\r\n    with respect to them is, therefore, ultimately for Congress to\r\n    determine. * * * I have no authority to speak for Congress in\r\n    respect to the ultimate disposition of the Islands. [186]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis bitter disappointment of the public expectation and hope\r\nof something definite, certainly did not lessen the belief of\r\nthe Filipinos that we have no notion of ever giving them their\r\nindependence. Had the Senate known what the Filipino commissioners\r\nwere so earnestly asking of the Otis commissioners in January,\r\n1899, the Bacon resolution would probably have passed. In fact it\r\nis demonstrable almost mathematically that, had the Administration's\r\nfriends in the Senate allowed that resolution to come to a vote before\r\nthe outbreak of February 4th, instead of filibustering against it until\r\nafter that event, it would have passed. As stated in the foot-note, the\r\nroll-call on the final vote on it, which was not taken until February\r\n14th, showed a tie--29 to 29, the Vice-President of the United States\r\ncasting the deciding vote which defeated it. Much dealing with real\r\nlife and real death has blunted my artistic sensibilities to thrills\r\nfrom the mere pantomime of the stage. But as here was a vote where,\r\nhad a single Senator who voted No voted Aye, some 300,000,000 of\r\ndollars, over a thousand lives of American soldiers killed in battle,\r\nsome 16,000 lives of Filipino soldiers killed in battle, and possibly\r\n100,000 Filipino lives snuffed out through famine, pestilence, and\r\nother ills consequent on the war, would have been saved, I can not\r\nrefrain from reproducing the vote--perhaps the most uniquely momentous\r\nsingle roll-call in the parliamentary history of Christendom [187]:\r\n\r\n\r\nAyes\r\n\r\n            Bacon                   Jones of Nevada\r\n            Bate                    Lindsay\r\n            Berry                   McLaurin\r\n            Caffery                 Martin\r\n            Chilton                 Money\r\n            Clay                    Murphy\r\n            Cockrell                Perkins\r\n            Faulkner                Pettigrew\r\n            Gorman                  Pettus\r\n            Gray                    Quay\r\n            Hale                    Rawlins\r\n            Harris                  Smith\r\n            Heitfield               Tillman\r\n            Hoar                    Turner\r\n            Jones of Arkansas\r\n\r\n\r\nNays\r\n\r\n            Allison                 Mantle\r\n            Burrows                 Morgan\r\n            Carter                  Nelson\r\n            Chandler                Penrose\r\n            Deboe                   Platt of Connecticut\r\n            Fairbanks               Platt of New York\r\n            Frye                    Pritchard\r\n            Gear                    Ross\r\n            Hanna                   Shoup\r\n            Hawley                  Simon\r\n            Kyle                    Stewart\r\n            Lodge                   Teller\r\n            McBride                 Warren\r\n            McEnery                 Wolcott\r\n            McMillan\r\n\r\n\r\nIn January, 1899, the out-and-out land-grabbers had not yet made bold\r\nto show their hand, the friends of the treaty confining themselves\r\nto the alleged shame of doing as we had done with Cuba, on account\r\nof the supposed semi-barbarous condition of \"the various tribes out\r\nthere,\" leaving the possibility of profit to quietly suggest itself\r\namid the noisy exhortations of altruism. It was not until after the\r\nmilk of human kindness had been spilled in war that Senator Lodge\r\nsaid at the Philadelphia National Republican Convention of 1900:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We make no hypocritical pretence of being interested in the\r\n    Philippines solely on account of others. We believe in Trade\r\n    Expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeaking (p. 82) of the meetings of what for lack of a better term\r\nI have above called the Otis-Aguinaldo Joint High Parleying Board,\r\nGeneral Otis says in his report:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Finally, the conferences became the object of insurgent suspicion,\r\n    * * * and * * * amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Filipino newspapers called attention to the fact that large\r\nreinforcements of American troops were on the way to Manila, and very\r\nplausibly inferred that the parleying was for delay only. By January\r\n26th the politeness of both the American and the Filipino commissioners\r\nhad been worn to a frazzle, and they adjourned, each recognizing that\r\nthe differences between them could ultimately be settled only on the\r\nfield of battle, in the event of the ratification of the treaty.\r\n\r\nJanuary 27th, General Otis cabled to Washington a letter from\r\nAguinaldo, of which he says in his report: \"I was surprised * * *\r\nbecause of the boldness with which he therein indicated his purpose\r\nto continue his assumptions and establish their correctness by the\r\narbitrament of war\" (p. 84). General Otis was \"surprised\" to the\r\nlast. Aguinaldo's letter is not at all surprising, though extremely\r\ninteresting. It sends General Otis a proclamation issued January 21st,\r\nannouncing the publication of a constitution modelled substantially\r\nafter that of the United States, even beginning with the familiar\r\nwords about \"securing the blessings of liberty, promoting the general\r\nwelfare,\" etc., and concludes with an expression of confident hope that\r\nthe United States will recognize his government, and a bold implication\r\nof determination to fight if it does not. On the evening of February\r\n4th an insurgent soldier approaching an American picket failed to\r\nhalt or answer when challenged, and was shot and killed. Nearly\r\nsix months of nervous tension thereupon pressed for liberation in\r\na general engagement which continued throughout the night and until\r\ntoward sundown of the next day, thus finally unleashing the dogs of\r\nwar. In the Washington Post of February 6, 1899, Senator Bacon is\r\nquoted as saying:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I will cheerfully vote all the money that may be necessary to\r\n    carry on the war in the Philippines, but I still maintain that we\r\n    could have avoided a conflict with those people had the Senate\r\n    adopted my resolution, or a similar resolution announcing our\r\n    honest intentions with regard to the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid the New York Criterion of February 11, 1899:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whether we like it or not, we must go on slaughtering the natives\r\n    in the English fashion, and taking what muddy glory lies in this\r\n    wholesale killing until they have learned to respect our arms. The\r\n    more difficult task of getting them to respect our intentions\r\n    will follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Washington Post of February 6, 1899, may not have quoted Senator\r\nBacon with exactitude. But what the Senator did say on the floor of\r\nthe Senate is important, historically. Under date of February 22,\r\n1912, Senator Bacon writes me, in answer to an inquiry:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I enclose a speech made by me upon the subject in the Senate\r\n    February 27, 1899, and upon pages 6, 7, and 8 of which you will\r\n    find a statement of my position, and the reasons given by me\r\n    therefor. Of course you cannot go at length into that question\r\n    in your narration of the events of that day, but my position was\r\n    that, while I did not approve of the war, and did not approve\r\n    of the enslavement of the Filipinos, and while if I had my way I\r\n    would immediately set them free, at the same time, as war was then\r\n    flagrant, and there were then some twenty odd thousand American\r\n    troops in the Philippine Islands, we must either support them or\r\n    leave them to defeat and death. I do not know how far you can use\r\n    anything then said by me, but if you make allusion to the fact\r\n    that I was willing to supply money and troops to carry on the war\r\n    in the Philippines, I would be glad for it to be accompanied by a\r\n    very brief statement of the ground upon which I based such action.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above makes it unnecessary to quote at length from the speech\r\nreferred to, which may be found at pp. 2456 et seq of the Congressional\r\nRecord for February 27, 1899. However, there is one passage in the\r\nspeech to which I especially say Amen, and invite all whose creed of\r\npatriotism is not too sublimated for such a common feeling to join\r\nme in so doing. Senator Bacon will now state the creed:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The oft-repeated expression \"our country, right or wrong\" has a\r\n    vital principle in it, and upon that principle I stand.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senator immediately follows his creed with these commentaries:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In this annexation of the Philippine Islands through the\r\n    ratification of the treaty, and in waging war to subjugate the\r\n    Filipinos, I think the country, acting through constitutional\r\n    authorities, is wrong. But it is not for me to say because the\r\n    country has been committed to a policy that I do not favor and\r\n    have opposed, in consequence of which there is war, that I will\r\n    not support the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the civilizing influence of Krag-Jorgensen rifles and the moral\r\nuplift of high explosive projectiles, what our soldiers used to call,\r\nwith questionable piety, \"the fear of God,\" was finally put into the\r\nhearts of the Filipinos, after much carnage by wholesale in battle\r\nformation and later by retail in a species of guerrilla warfare as\r\nirritating as it was obstinate. But they have never yet learned to\r\nrespect our intentions, because under the guidance of three successive\r\nPresidents we have studiously refrained from any authoritative\r\ndeclaration as to what those intentions are. We are loth to hark back\r\nto the only right course, a course similar to our action in Cuba,\r\nbecause of the expense we have been to in the Philippines. But we also\r\nknow that the islands are and are likely to continue, a costly burden,\r\na nuisance, and a distinct strategic disadvantage in the event of war;\r\nand that Mr. Cleveland was right when he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The government of remote and alien people should have no permanent\r\n    place in the purposes of our national life.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mistaken policy which involved us in a war to subjugate the\r\nFilipinos, following our war to free the Cubans, will never stand\r\natoned for before the bar of history, nor can the Filipinos ever in\r\nreason be expected to respect our intentions, until the law-making\r\npower of the government shall have authoritatively declared what\r\nthose intentions are--i. e., what we intend ultimately to do with the\r\nislands. Senator Bacon's resolutions of 1899 were, are, and always\r\nwill be the last word on the first act needed to rectify the original\r\nPhilippine blunder, \"announcing\" as they would, to use the language\r\nattributed to their distinguished author by the Washington Post of\r\nFebruary 6, 1899, above-quoted, \"our honest intentions with regard to\r\nthe Philippines.\" So eager is the exploiter to exploit the islands,\r\nand so apprehensive is the Filipino that the exploiter will have more\r\ninfluence at Washington than himself and therefore be able ultimately\r\nto bring about a practical industrial slavery, that common honesty\r\ndemands such a declaration. To doctor present Filipino discontent\r\nwith Benevolent Uncertainty is a mere makeshift. The remedy the\r\nsituation needs is simple, but as yet untried--Frankness. The chief\r\nof the causes of the present discontent among the Filipinos with\r\nAmerican rule is precisely the same old serpent that precipitated\r\nthe war thirteen years ago, to wit, lack of a frank and honest\r\ndeclaration of our purpose. The trouble then lay, and still lies,\r\nand, in the absence of some such declaration as that proposed by\r\nthe Bacon resolution, will always lie in what seemed then, and still\r\nseems, to the Filipinos \"an evident purpose to keep the islands and\r\nan accompanying unwillingness to acknowledge that purpose.\" Some\r\nmay object that one Congress cannot bind another. The same argument\r\nwould have killed the Teller amendment to the declaration of war with\r\nSpain avowing our purpose as to Cuba. Such an argument assumes that\r\nthis nation has no sense of honor, and that it should cling for a\r\nwhile longer to the stale Micawberism that the Islands may yet pay,\r\nbefore it decides whether it will do right or not, and signalizes\r\nsuch decision by formal announcement through Congress. To men capable\r\nof such an assumption as the one just indicated, this book is not\r\naddressed. Three successive Presidents, Messrs. McKinley, Roosevelt,\r\nand Taft, have with earnest asseveration of benevolent intention tried\r\nwithout success all these years to win the affections of the Filipino\r\npeople, and to make them feel that \"our flag had not lost its gift of\r\nbenediction in its world-wide journey to their shores,\" as Mr. McKinley\r\nused to say. But the corner-stone of the policy was laid before we\r\nknew anything about how the land lay, and on the assumption, made\r\npractically without any knowledge whatever on the subject, that the\r\nFilipino people were incapable of self-government. The corner-stone\r\nof our Philippine policy has been from the beginning precisely that\r\nurged by Spain for not freeing Cuba, viz., \"to spare the people from\r\nthe dangers of premature independence.\" The three Presidents named\r\nabove have always been willing to imply independence, but never to\r\npromise it. And the unwillingness to declare a purpose ultimately to\r\ngive the Filipinos their independence has always been due to the desire\r\nto catch the vote of those who are determined they shall never have\r\nit. In this inexorable and unchangeable political necessity lies the\r\nessential contemptibleness of republican imperialism, and the secret\r\nof why the Filipinos, notwithstanding our good intentions, do not like\r\nus, and never will under the present policy. How can you blame them?\r\n\r\nYet the more you know of the Filipinos, the better you like\r\nthem. Self-sacrificing, brave, and faithful unto death in war, they\r\nare gentle, generous, and tractable in peace. Moreover, respect\r\nfor constituted authority, as such, is innate in practically every\r\nFilipino, which I am not sure can be predicated concerning each and\r\nevery citizen of my beloved native land. And we can win the grateful\r\nand lasting affection of the whole seven or eight millions of them any\r\nday we wish to. How? Have done with vague, vote-catching Presidential\r\nobiter, and through your Congress declare your purpose!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nOTIS AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n                Am I the boss, or am I a tool,\r\n                Am I Governor-General or a hobo--hobo;\r\n                Now I'd like to know who's the boss of the show,\r\n                Is it me, or Emilio Aguinaldo?\r\n\r\n                                Army Song of the Philippines under Otis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The thing is on,\" said General Hughes, Provost Marshal of Manila, to\r\nGeneral Otis, at Malacanan palace, on the night of February 4, 1899,\r\nabout half past eight o'clock, as soon as the firing started. [188]\r\nHe was talking about something which every American in Manila except\r\nGeneral Otis had for months frankly recognized as inevitable--the war.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the outbreak of February 4th, General Otis had under\r\nhis command 838 officers and 20,032 enlisted men, say in round numbers\r\na total of 21,000. Of these some 15,500 were State volunteers mostly\r\nfrom the Western States, and the rest were regulars. All the volunteers\r\nand 1650 of the regulars were, or were about to become, entitled to\r\ntheir discharge, and their right was perfected by the exchange of\r\nratifications of the treaty of peace with Spain on April 11, 1899. The\r\ntotal force which he was thus entitled to command for any considerable\r\nperiod consisted of less than 4000. Of the 21,000 men on hand as\r\naforesaid, on February 4th, deducting those at Cavite and Iloilo,\r\nthe sick and wounded, those serving in civil departments, and in the\r\nstaff organizations, the effective fighting force was 14,000, and of\r\nthese 3000 constituted the Provost Guard in the great and hostile\r\ncity of Manila. [189] Thus there were only 11,000 men, including\r\nthose entitled to discharge, available to engage the insurgent army,\r\n\"which,\" says Secretary of War Root, \"was two or three times that\r\nnumber, well armed and equipped, and included many of the native\r\ntroops formerly comprised in the Spanish army.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the predicament into which General Otis's supremely zealous\r\nefforts to help the Administration get the treaty through the Senate\r\nby withholding from the American people the knowledge of facts which\r\nmight have put them on notice that they were paying $20,000,000 for\r\na $200,000,000 insurrection, had brought us. This is not a tale of\r\nwoe. It is a tale of the disgust--good-humored, because stoical--which\r\nfinally found expression at the time in the army song that heads this\r\nchapter, disgust at unnecessary sacrifice of American life which could\r\nso easily have been prevented had General Otis only revealed the real\r\nsituation in time to have had plenty of troops on hand. It is a requiem\r\nover those brave men of the Eighth Army Corps from Pennsylvania,\r\nTennessee, and the Western States that bore the brunt of the early\r\nfighting, whose lives were needlessly sacrificed in 1899 as the\r\nresult of an unpreparedness for war due to anxiety not to embarrass\r\nMr. McKinley in his efforts to get the treaty through the Senate,\r\nan unpreparedness which remained long unremedied thereafter in order\r\nto conceal from the people of the United States the unanimity of the\r\ndesire of the Filipinos for Independence.\r\n\r\nIt is quite true that none of our people then in the Islands realized\r\nthis unanimity in all its pathos at the outset, but it soon became\r\nclear to everybody except the commanding general. It naturally dawned\r\non him last of all, because he did not visit the most reliable sources\r\nof information, to wit, the battlefields during the fighting, and\r\ntherefore did not see how tenaciously the Filipinos fought for the\r\nindependence of their country. Moreover, General Otis tried to think\r\ntill the last along lines in harmony with the original theory of\r\nBenevolent Assimilation. Hence Mr. Root's nonsense of 1899 and 1900\r\nabout \"the patient and unconsenting millions\" dominated by \"the Tagalo\r\ntribe,\" which nonsense was immensely serviceable in a campaign for the\r\npresidency wherein antidotes for sympathy with a people struggling\r\nto be free were of supreme practical political value. General Otis\r\nactually had Mr. McKinley believing as late as December, 1899, at\r\nleast, that the opposition to a change of masters in lieu of Freedom\r\nwas confined to a little coterie of self-seeking politicians who were\r\nin the business for what they could get out of it, and that the great\r\nmajority would prefer him, Otis, to Aguinaldo, as governor-general. It\r\nis difficult on first blush to accept this statement as dispassionately\r\ncorrect, but there is no escape from the record. Mr. McKinley said\r\nin his annual message to Congress in December, 1899, in reviewing\r\nthe direction he gave to the Paris peace negotiations which ended\r\nin the purchase of the islands, and the war with the Filipinos which\r\nhad followed, and had then been raging since February 4th previous,\r\n\"I had every reason to believe, and still believe that the transfer\r\nof sovereignty was in accordance with the wishes and aspirations of\r\nthe great mass of the Filipino people.\"\r\n\r\nYet every American soldier who served in the Philippines at the time\r\nknows that Aguinaldo held the whole people in the hollow of his hand,\r\nbecause he was their recognized leader, the incarnation of their\r\naspirations. [190]\r\n\r\nDuring the presidential campaign of 1900, while the war with the\r\nFilipinos was still raging, partisan rancour bitterly called in\r\nquestion the sincerity of President McKinley's statement in his annual\r\nmessage to Congress of December, 1899, that he then still believed \"the\r\ntransfer of sovereignty was in accord with the wishes and aspirations\r\nof the great mass of the Filipino people,\" on the ground that he must\r\nby the time he made that statement have understood how grossly--however\r\nhonestly--General Otis had misled him as to the unanimity and tenacity\r\nof the Filipino purpose. But it is only necessary to read Admiral\r\nDewey's testimony before the Senate Committee of 1902 to understand\r\nMr. McKinley's allusion in this same message to Congress of 1899 to\r\n\"the sinister ambition of a few leaders,\" and this, once understood,\r\nexplains the other statement of the message. Admiral Dewey came\r\nhome in the fall of 1899 and undoubtedly filled Mr. McKinley with\r\nthe estimate of Aguinaldo which makes such painful reading in the\r\nAdmiral's testimony of 1902 before the Senate Committee, where he\r\nabused Aguinaldo like a pick-pocket, so to speak, saying his original\r\nmotive was principally loot. [191] In the fall of 1899 Aguinaldo had\r\nissued a proclamation claiming that Admiral Dewey originally promised\r\nhim independence, and Admiral Dewey had bitterly denounced this as a\r\nfalsehood, so that the Admiral always cherished a very real resentment\r\nagainst the insurgent chief thereafter. His estimate of the Filipino\r\nleader as being in the insurrection merely for what he could get out\r\nof it was wholly erroneous, and has long since been exploded, all our\r\ngenerals of the early fighting and all Americans who have known him\r\nsince being unanimous that Aguinaldo was and is a sincere patriot;\r\nbut it undoubtedly explains Mr. McKinley's still clinging, in 1899,\r\nto the notion derived from General Otis that the insurrection did not\r\nhave the moral and material backing of the whole Filipino people. The\r\nFilipino leaders were familiar with the spirit of our institutions. The\r\nmen who controlled their counsels were high-minded, educated, patriotic\r\nmen. \"For myself and the officers and men under my command,\" wrote\r\nGeneral Merritt to Aguinaldo in August, 1898, just after the fall\r\nof Manila, \"I can say that we have conceived a high respect for the\r\nabilities and qualities of the Filipinos, and if called upon by the\r\nGovernment to express an opinion, it will be to that effect.\" [192]\r\n\r\nThe leaders believed that the American people did not fully understand\r\nthe identity of the Philippine situation with that in Cuba, and that\r\nif they had, the treaty would not have been ratified. They also knew\r\nthe supreme futility of trying to get the facts before the American\r\npeople by peaceful means. And it was really with the abandon of genuine\r\npatriotism that they plunged their country into war. We did not know\r\nit then, but we do know it now. It would be simply wooden-headed to\r\naffirm that they ever expected to succeed in a war with us. Of course\r\nsome of the jeunesse doree, as General Bell calls them in one of his\r\nearly reports, [193] grew very aggressive and insulting toward the\r\nlast. But the thinking men went into the war for independence in a\r\nspirit of \"decent respect to the opinions of mankind,\" to correct the\r\nimpression General Otis had communicated to Mr. McKinley, and through\r\nhim to our people, in the hope that the more lives they sacrificed\r\nin such a war (they risked--and many of them lost--their own also),\r\nthe nearer they would come to refuting the idea that they did not\r\nknow what they wanted. It was the only way they had to appeal to\r\nCaesar, i.e., to the great heart of the American people. As the war\r\ngrew more and more unpopular in the United States, the impression\r\nwas more and more nursed here at home that the people did not really\r\nwant independence, but were being coerced; and that they were like\r\ndumb driven cattle. The striking similarity of these suggestions\r\nto those by which tyranny has always met the struggles of men to\r\nbe free, did not seem to occur to the American public. They were\r\naccepted as authoritative, being convenient also as an antidote to\r\nsympathy. General Otis had suppressed such words as \"sovereignty,\"\r\n\"protection,\" and the like from his original sugar-coated edition\r\nof the Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation, offering an elaborate\r\ncock-and-bull explanation of why he did so. The Filipino answer to\r\nthis took the form of a very clever newspaper cartoon, representing an\r\nAmerican in a carromata--a kind of two-wheeled buggy--with a Filipino\r\nbetween the shafts pulling it; which cartoon of course, never reached\r\nthe United States. The Filipinos had never heard the story on General\r\nMahone about \"tie yoh hoss an' come in,\" [194] but they had heard of\r\nthe jinrickshaws of Japan, and they had read in Holy Writ and elsewhere\r\nof conquered people becoming hewers of wood and drawers of water to\r\ninvading conquerors. And they are not without a sense of humor. It is\r\na common mistake with many Americans--for quite a few among us suffer\r\nintellectually from over-sophistication--to suppose we monopolize all\r\nthe sense of humor there is, and that that alone is proof of a due\r\nsense of proportion. At any rate, the Filipinos, with all due respect\r\nto General Otis's good intentions, understood that \"sovereignty\" and\r\n\"protection\" meant alien domination, so there was nothing in the Otis\r\nnotion that for them those words had a \"peculiar meaning which might\r\nbe advantageously used by the Tagalo war party to incite,\" etc. [195]\r\n\r\nHaving now gotten into a war on the theory that only a small fraction\r\nof the Filipino people were opposed to a new and unknown yoke in\r\nlieu of the old one, General Otis still continued to try to square\r\nhis theory with the facts. For many months he sat at his desk in\r\nManila cheerily waging war with an inadequate force, and retaining in\r\nthe service and on the firing line after their terms of enlistment\r\nexpired, under pretence that they consented to it willingly, a lot\r\nof fellows from Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and the Western States, who\r\nhad volunteered for the war with Spain, with intent to kill Spaniards\r\nin order to free Cubans, and not with intent to kill Filipinos for\r\nalso wanting to be free. Seeing nothing of the fighting himself,\r\nhe of course failed to get a correct estimate of the tenacity of\r\nthe Filipino purpose. No purpose is here entertained to suggest\r\nthat any of those early volunteers went around preaching mutiny,\r\nor feeling mutinous. They did not originally like the Filipinos\r\nespecially; furthermore, they liked the Philippines less than they\r\ndid the Filipinos, and they had a vague notion that some one had\r\nblundered. But it was not theirs to ask the reason why. Besides,\r\nthe orders from Washington being not to clash with the Filipinos\r\nat least until the treaty was ratified, the Filipino soldiers and\r\nsubaltern officers had been calling them cowards for some time with\r\nimpunity. So that as soon as the treaty was safely \"put over,\" they\r\nwere very glad to let off steam by killing a few hundred of them. But\r\ntheir hearts were not in the fight, in the sense of clear and profound\r\nconviction of the righteousness of the war. However, war is war, and\r\nthey were soldiers, and \"orders is orders,\" as Tommy Atkins says. So\r\nlet us turn to an honester, if grimmer, side of the picture.\r\n\r\nThe first battle of the war began about 8:30 o'clock on the night\r\nof February 4th, and lasted all through that night and until about\r\n5 o'clock in the afternoon of the next day. Our casualties numbered\r\nabout 250 killed and wounded. The insurgent loss was estimated at\r\n3000. \"Those of the insurgents will never be known,\" says General\r\nOtis. [196] \"We buried 700 of them.\" [197] There was fighting pretty\r\nmuch all around Manila, for the insurgents had the city almost hemmed\r\nin. An arc of a circle, broken in places possibly, but several miles\r\nlong, drawn about the city, would probably suggest the general idea\r\nof the enemy's lines. They had been allowed to dig trenches without\r\ninterference while the debate in the Senate on the treaty was in\r\nprogress, pursuant to the temporary \"peace-at-any-price\" programme. The\r\narc was broken into smithereens by 5 P.M. of February 5th. When the\r\nmorning of February 6th came Col. James F. Smith, commanding the First\r\nCalifornias, was non est inventus, and so was a large part of his\r\nregiment. \"No one seemed to know definitely his location,\" says the\r\nOtis Report. [198] As a matter of fact he had taken two battalions of\r\nhis regiment and waded clean through the enemy's lines, and had to be\r\nsent for to come back to form again with the line of battle needed to\r\nprotect the city. So the Californias probably carried off the pick of\r\nthe laurels of the first day's fighting. General Anderson, commanding\r\nthe First Division of the Eighth Corps, threw them some very handsome\r\nwell earned bouquets in his report, stating also that their colonel\r\nhad shown \"the very best qualities of a volunteer officer\"--why he\r\nlimited it to \"volunteer\" does not appear, but is inferable from the\r\nwell-known disposition of all regulars to consider all volunteers\r\n\"rookies\" [199]--and recommended that he be made a brigadier general,\r\nwhich shortly afterward was done. [200]\r\n\r\nIt would be invidious to follow the various phases of the subsequent\r\nearly fighting, and single out one or more States [201] and tell of the\r\nhard earned and well deserved honors they won, because space forbids\r\na proper tribute to the heroism of all of them. As for the regulars,\r\n[202] they were the same they were at Santiago de Cuba, the same\r\nthey always are anywhere you put them. When a newspaper man would\r\ncome around a regular regiment during the fighting before Santiago\r\nhe would be told that they had no news to give him, \"We ain't heroes,\r\nwe're regulars,\" they would say. After the outbreak of February 4th,\r\nall our people did well, acted nobly, \"Angels could no more.\" Neither\r\ncould devils, as shown by the losses inflicted on the enemy.\r\n\r\nThere was more fighting outside Manila during the next two or three\r\ndays, and when that was done the somewhat shattered insurgent legions\r\nhad recoiled to the distantly visible foot-hills, convinced that\r\ntheir notion they could take Manila was very foolish and very rash.\r\n\r\nAt the town of Caloocan, some three or four miles out to the north\r\nof Manila, were located the shops and round houses of the Manila and\r\nDagupan Railway, which runs from Manila in a northwesterly direction\r\nabout 120 miles to Dagupan, and was then the only railroad in the\r\narchipelago. It was fed by a vast rich farming country, the great\r\nplain of central Luzon. Naturally, the central plain which fed the\r\nrailroad that traversed it and kept its teeming myriads of small\r\nfarmers in touch with the great outside world was to be sooner or\r\nlater, the theatre of war. To seize transportation is instinctively\r\nthe first tactical move of a military man. Lieutenant-General Luna,\r\ncommander-in-chief, next to Aguinaldo, of the revolutionary forces, the\r\nman whom later Aguinaldo had shot, was just then at Caloocan with 4000\r\nmen. So it fell to General MacArthur, commanding the Second Division of\r\nthe Eighth Corps, to move on Caloocan, which he did on February 10th.\r\n\r\nJohn F. Bass, correspondent for Harper's Weekly, writing from Manila\r\na short time after this, describes this movement. It was our first\r\nmove away from the city of Manila. With a few masterly strokes of the\r\npen, which I regret there is not space to reproduce here in full,\r\nMr. Bass gives a vivid picture of the various engagements, and of\r\n\"a background of burning villages, smoke, fire, shot, and shell, the\r\nceaseless tramp of tired and often bleeding feet,\" etc. \"Heroism,\"\r\nhe says, \"became a matter of course and death an incident.\" Finally\r\nhis story pauses for a moment thus: \"The natural comment is that\r\nall this is merely war--the business of the soldier. True, nor do\r\nI think Jimmie Green [Mr. Bass's name for our \"Tommy Atkins\"] is\r\ntroubled with heroics. He accepts the situation without excitement\r\nor hysterics. He has little feeling in this matter for his heart is\r\nnot in this fight.\" Here brother Bass's moralizing ceases abruptly,\r\nand the contagious excitement of the hour catches him, just as it\r\nalways does the average man under such circumstances:\r\n\r\n\r\n    From La Loma church you may get the full view of our long line\r\n    crossing the open field, evenly, steadily, irresistibly, like an\r\n    inrolling wave on the beach * * *. Watch the regiments go forward,\r\n    and form under fire, and move on and on, and you will exclaim:\r\n    \"Magnificent,\" and you will gulp a little and feel proud without\r\n    exactly knowing why. Then gradually the power of that line will\r\n    force itself upon you, and you will feel that you must follow,\r\n    that wherever that line goes you must go also. By and by you will\r\n    be sorry, but for the present the might of an American regiment\r\n    has got possession of you.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnybody who has ever been with an American regiment in action knows\r\nexactly how the man who wrote that felt. The American who has never\r\nhad the experience Mr. Bass describes above has missed one way of\r\nrealizing the majesty of the power of the republic whereof he is\r\nprivileged to be a citizen. For if there is one national trait which\r\nmore than any other explains the greatness of our country, it is the\r\ninstinct for organization, the fondness for self-multiplication to\r\nthe nth power by intelligent co-operation with one's fellows to a\r\ncommon end. Especially is the experience in question inspiring where\r\nthe example of the field officers is particularly appropriate to the\r\noccasion. Take for instance the following, concerning the conduct of\r\nMajor J. Franklin Bell in this advance on Caloocan, from the report\r\nof Major Kobbe, Commanding the Artillery:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As the right cleared the head of the ravine, I could see\r\n    Maj. J. F. Bell * * * leading a company of Montana troops in front\r\n    of the right * * * advancing, firing, toward intrenchments * * *.\r\n    He was on a black horse to the last * * * leading and cheering\r\n    the men. His work was most gallant and * * * especially cheering\r\n    to me. [203]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo mere scribe can magnify General Bell's matchless efficiency in\r\naction, but it is certainly inspiring to contemplate. There are no\r\n\"fuss and feathers\" about him. Yet his power, proven on many a field\r\nin the Philippines, to kindle martial ardor by example, suggests the\r\nubiquitous \"Helmet of Navarre\" of Lord Macaulay's poem.\r\n\r\nA little later correspondent Bass develops what he meant by \"by\r\nand by you will be sorry.\" You see it is not comfortable business,\r\nthis of hustling about among the dead and dying. In the excitement,\r\nyou are so liable to step on the face of some poor devil you knew\r\nwell, maybe a once warm friend. In this connection Mr. Bass says:\r\n\"There is this difference between the manner in which American and\r\nFilipino soldiers die. The American falls in a heap and dies hard;\r\nthe Filipino stretches himself out, and when dead is always found in\r\nsome easy attitude, generally with his head on his arms. They die\r\nthe way a wild animal dies--in just such a position as one finds a\r\ndeer or an antelope which one has shot in the woods.\"\r\n\r\nSo far as the writer is advised and believes, nobody who knows\r\nJohn F. Bass ever suspected him of being a quitter. He must have\r\nbeen reading the London Standard, which said about that time:\r\n\"It is a little startling to find the liberators of Cuba engaged\r\nin suppressing a youthful republic which claims the sacred right of\r\nself-government.\" Bass had written his newspaper in August previous,\r\nafter observing how pluckily the Filipinos had fought and licked\r\nthe Spaniards: \"Give them their independence and guarantee it to\r\nthem.\" The overwhelming sentiment of the Eighth Army Corps when we\r\ntook the Philippines was against taking them; and those who had kept\r\ninformed knew that the Senate had ratified the treaty by a majority\r\nonly one more than enough to squeeze it through, the vote having been\r\n57 to 27, at least 56 being thus indispensable to make the necessary\r\nconstitutional two-thirds of the 84 votes cast; and that Wall Street\r\nand the White Man's Burden or land-grabbing contingent--\"Philanthropy\r\nand Five per cent,\" as Secretary of the Treasury Lyman J. Gage put\r\nit at the time--were responsible for these shambles Mr. Bass describes.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture some soft-headed gentleman asks: \"What is this\r\nman who writes this book driving at? Is he trying to show that the\r\nAmerican soldiers in the Philippines in February, 1899, all wanted\r\nto quit as soon as the war broke out?\" Not at all. In the first\r\nplace it hardly lay in American soldier nature to want to quit when\r\nAguinaldo was telling us \"if you don't take your flag down and out of\r\nthese islands at once and promptly get out yourselves along with it,\r\nI will proceed to kick you out and throw it out.\" And in the next\r\nplace, in the war with the Filipinos, as in all other wars, fuel was\r\nadded to the flame as soon as the war broke out. Among the Americans,\r\ncharges soon came into general circulation and acceptance that the\r\nFilipinos had planned (but been frustrated in) a plot looking to a\r\ngeneral massacre of all foreigners in Manila. This alleged plot was\r\nsupposed to have been scheduled to be carried out on a certain night\r\nshortly after February 15, 1899. Among the Filipinos, on the other\r\nhand, counter-charges soon followed, and met with general credence,\r\nthat the Americans made a practise of killing prisoners taken in\r\nbattle, including the wounded. Neither charge was ever proven, but\r\nboth served the purpose, at the psychologic moment, of possessing\r\neach side with the desire to kill, which is the business of war. Let\r\nus glance briefly at these recriminations.\r\n\r\nBetween pages 1916 and 1917 of Senate Document 331, part 2 [204] may\r\nbe found a photo-lithograph of the celebrated alleged order of the\r\nFilipino Revolutionary Government of February 15, 1899, to massacre\r\nall foreign residents of Manila. In his report for 1899 [205] General\r\nOtis himself describes this order as one \"which for barbarous intent\r\nis unequalled in these modern times in civilized warfare,\" and speaks\r\nof it as \"issued by the Malolos Government through the responsible\r\nofficer who had raised and organized the hostile inhabitants within\r\nthe city.\" After Aguinaldo was captured in 1901, according to an\r\naccount given by General MacArthur to the Senate Committee in 1902, of\r\na conversation with the insurgent leader, the latter was shown a copy\r\nof this document purporting to have been signed by General Luna, one of\r\nhis generals. He disclaimed having in any way sanctioned it, in fact\r\ndisclaimed any prior knowledge of it whatsoever, [206] a disclaimer\r\nwhich General MacArthur appears to have accepted as true, frankly and\r\nentirely. At page 1890 of the same volume, Captain J. R. M. Taylor,\r\n14th U. S. Infantry, a gallant soldier and an accomplished scholar,\r\nwho was in charge in 1901 of the captured insurgent records at Manila,\r\nstates that he was \"informed\" that the document was originally \"signed\r\nby Sandico, then Secretary of the Interior\" of the revolutionary\r\ngovernment. Captain Taylor made an attempt to run the matter down,\r\nbut obtained no evidence convincing to him. A like investigation by\r\nGeneral MacArthur in 1901 had a like result. [207]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Major Wm. H. Bishop, of the 20th Kansas, was\r\ncredited in a soldier's letter written home, which first came to light\r\nin this country, with killing unarmed prisoners during the advance on\r\nCaloocan. The charges originated with a private of that regiment. Major\r\nBishop denied the charges. [208] An investigation followed, in the\r\ncourse of which somebody made an innuendo, or charge--it is not\r\nimportant which--that other officers used their influence to prevent\r\na full ventilation of the matter, specifically, General Funston,\r\nthen Colonel of the 20th Kansas, and Major Metcalf, of the same\r\nregiment. These last two also made a most vigorous general denial,\r\nand nothing whatever was established against them. The whole matter\r\nwas finally disposed of by being forwarded to the War Department at\r\nWashington by General Otis on July 13, 1899, some six months after the\r\noccurrences alleged, with the remark that he (General Otis) \"doubted\r\nthe wisdom of a court-martial\" of the soldier who had made the charge\r\nagainst Major Bishop, \"as it would give the insurgent authorities a\r\nknowledge of what was taking place, and they would assert positively\r\nthat our troops practised inhumanities, whether the charges could\r\nbe proven or not\" and that they would use the incident \"as an excuse\r\nto defend their own barbarities.\" [209] The last endorsement on the\r\npapers preceding General Otis's final endorsement was one by Colonel\r\nCrowder, now (1912) Judge Advocate General of the United States Army,\r\nin which he said: \"I am not convinced from a careful reading of this\r\nreport, that Private Brenner has made a false charge against Captain\r\nBishop\"; adding that \"considerations of public policy, sufficiently\r\ngrave to silence every other demand, require that no further action\r\nbe taken in this case.\" [210] The \"considerations of public policy\"\r\nwere of course those indicated in General Otis's final endorsement on\r\nthe papers, already quoted. They were compellingly controlling, in my\r\njudgment, independently of the merits. Washing one's soiled linen in\r\npublic is never advisable, and placing a weapon in your enemy's hand\r\nin time of war is at least equally unwise. Some shreds of this once\r\nmuch mooted matter doubtless still linger in the public memory. It\r\nhas been thus briefly ventilated here solely to trace the genesis of\r\nthe bitterness of that war, and of numerous later barbarities avenged\r\nin kind. The bitterness thus early begun grew as the war went on,\r\nuntil every time a hapless Filipino peasant soldier speaking only\r\ntwo or three words of Spanish would falsely explain, when captured,\r\nthat he was a non-combatant, an amigo (friend), it usually at once\r\nfilled the captor with vivid recollections of slain comrades, and of\r\nrumored or sometimes proven mutilation of their bodies after death,\r\nand these reflections would at once fill him with a yearning desire\r\nto blow the top of the amigo's head off, whether he yielded to the\r\ndesire or not. Of no instance where he did so yield am I aware. But\r\nI do know that the invariable statement of all Filipinos unarmed and\r\nun-uniformed when captured, to the effect that they were amigos, became\r\nto the American soldier not remotely dissimilar to the waving of a red\r\nrag at a bull. Of course this was also due, largely, to the guerrilla\r\npractice of hiding guns when hard-pressed and actually plunging at\r\nonce into some make-believe agricultural pursuit. As for Major Bishop,\r\nit is inconceivable to me that he gave any order to kill unarmed\r\nprisoners. Even admitting for the sake of the argument that he is a\r\nfiend, he is not a fool. As a matter of fact, he was a brave soldier,\r\nas all the reports show, and is a reputable lawyer, having many warm\r\nfriends whose opinion of any man would command respect anywhere. The\r\ntruth of the whole matter probably is that just before going into\r\nbattle, when our troops were in an ugly temper by reason of the\r\nrumors of barbarities alleged to have been perpetrated by the enemy,\r\nor contemplated by him, the word was passed along the line to \"Take no\r\nmore prisoners than we have to,\" and that that thought originated with\r\nsome irresponsible private soldier of the line inflamed by stories\r\nof mutilation of our dead or of maltreatment of our wounded. Such a\r\n\"word,\" so passed from man to man, can, in the heat of conflict,\r\nvery soon evolve into something having for practical purposes all\r\nthe force and effect of an order.\r\n\r\nThrough the foregoing, and like causes, including the \"water cure,\"\r\nlater invented to persuade amigos to discover the whereabouts of hidden\r\ninsurgent guns or give information as to the movements of the enemy,\r\n[211] our war with the Filipinos became, before it was over, a rather\r\n\"dark and bloody\" affair, accentuated as it was, from time to time,\r\nby occasional Filipino success in surprising detachments from ambush,\r\nor by taking them unawares and off their guard in their quarters,\r\nand eliminating them, the most notable instance of the first being\r\nthe crumpling of a large command of the 15th Infantry by General Juan\r\nCailles, in southern Luzon, and the most indelibly remembered and\r\nimportant example of the second being the massacre of the 9th Infantry\r\npeople at Balangiga, in Samar, in the fall of 1901. Certainly more\r\nthan one American in that long-drawn-out war did things unworthy of\r\nany civilized man, things he would have believed it impossible, before\r\nhe went out there, ever to come to. Personally, I have heard, so far\r\nas I now recollect, of comparatively few barbarities perpetrated\r\nby Filipinos on captured American soldiers. Barbarities on their\r\nside seemed to have been reserved for those of their own race whom\r\nthey found disloyal to the cause of their country. Personally I\r\nhave never seen the water-cure administered. But I once went on\r\na confidential mission by direction of General MacArthur, in the\r\ncourse of which I reported first, on arriving in the neighborhood\r\nof the contemplated destination, to a general officer of the regular\r\narmy who is still such to-day. [212] That night the general was good\r\nenough to extend the usual courtesy of a cot to sleep on, in the\r\nheadquarters building. Toward dusk I went to dine with a certain\r\nlieutenant, also of the regular army. [213] As we approached the\r\nlieutenant's quarters a sergeant came up with a prisoner, and asked\r\ninstructions as to what to do with him. The lieutenant said: \"Take\r\nhim out and find out what he knows. Do you understand, Sergeant?\" The\r\nsergeant saluted, answered in the affirmative, and moved away with\r\nhis prisoner. We went in to the lieutenant's quarters, and while at\r\ndinner heard groans outside. I said \"What is that, Jones?\" [214]\r\nJones said: \"That's the water-cure he's giving that hombre. [215]\r\nWant to see it?\" I replied that I certainly did not. Returning that\r\nnight to the general's headquarters, after breakfast the next morning\r\nI met my friend Jones coming out of the general's office. I said:\r\n\"What's the matter, what are you doing here,\" he having mentioned\r\nthe evening before an expedition planned for the morrow. He said:\r\n\"Well, I've just had a talk with the general to see if I could get my\r\nresignation from the army accepted?\" \"Why?\" said I. \"Well,\" was the\r\nreply, \"that ----\" (designating the prisoner of the night before by a\r\ndouble barrelled epithet) \"died on me last night.\" Just how the matter\r\nwas hushed up I have never known, but Jones was never punished. More\r\nthan one general officer of the United States Army in the Philippines\r\nduring our war with the Filipinos at least winked at the water-cure\r\nas a means of getting information, and quite a number of subalterns\r\nmade a custom of applying it for that purpose. It was practically\r\nthe only way you could get them to betray their countrymen. Did\r\nI report the incident to General MacArthur? Certainly not. It was\r\nthe business of the general commanding the district. The water-cure,\r\nthough very painful, was seldom fatal, and when not fatal was almost\r\nnever permanently damaging, and it was about the only way to shake\r\nthe loyalty of the average Filipino and make him give information\r\nas to hidden insurgent guns, guerrilla bands, etc. It was a part of\r\nBenevolent Assimilation.\r\n\r\nLet us now return to the early battlefields about Manila which we\r\nleft, initially, to analyze the extreme bitterness of the feeling\r\nbetween the combatants that very early began to develop.\r\n\r\nWe left war correspondent John F. Bass among the dead and dying on\r\none of these fields, supposedly musing on the White Man's Burden,\r\nor Land-Grabbing, or Trust-for-Civilization theory, or whatever it\r\nwas that moved the fifty-seven senators whose votes had ratified\r\nthe treaty by a majority of just one more than the constitutionally\r\nnecessary two-thirds.\r\n\r\nThe reason the writer lays so much stress on Mr. Bass's letters to\r\nHarper's Weekly on the early fighting in the Philippines, is because\r\nhis remarks come direct from the battlefield, and are, as it were,\r\nres gestae. They were made dum fervet opus, to use a law Latin phrase\r\nwhich in plain English means \"while the iron is hot.\" They reflect\r\nmore or less accurately the feelings of the men whose deeds he was\r\nrecording. He, and O. K. Davis, now Washington correspondent of the\r\nNew York Times, and John T. McCutcheon, of Chicago, the now famous\r\ncartoonist (who was with Dewey in the battle of Manila Bay), and\r\nRobert Collins, now London correspondent of the Associated Press, and\r\n\"Dick\" Little of the Chicago Tribune,--a little man about six feet\r\nthree,--and lots of other good men and true, were all through that\r\nfighting, and we will later come to an issue of personal veracity\r\nbetween them and General Otis which culminated in the retirement from\r\noffice of Secretary of War Alger, and ought to have resulted in the\r\nrecall of General Otis, but did not, because to have acknowledged\r\nwhat a blunderer General Otis had been and to have relieved him from\r\ncommand, as he should have been relieved, would have been to \"swap\r\nhorses crossing a stream,\" as Mr. Lincoln used to put it in declining\r\nto change generals during a given campaign. The object here is to\r\nbring out the truth of history as to how the men who bore the brunt of\r\nthe early fighting felt about it. Testimony as to what the officers\r\nand men of the army said would be of no value, because a complaining\r\nsoldier's complaints are too often only a proof of \"cold feet.\" [216]\r\n\r\nThese newspaper men, not under military orders, were daily risking\r\ntheir lives voluntarily, just to keep the American public informed,\r\nand the American public were kept in darkness and only vouchsafed\r\nbulletins giving them the progressive lists of their dead and wounded,\r\nand this last only on demand made upon Secretary Alger by the people\r\nof Minnesota, the Dakotas, etc., through their senators. The War\r\nDepartment did not want the people to know, did not want to admit\r\nitself, how plucky, vigorous, and patriotic the resistance was. The\r\nperiod of the fighting done by the State Volunteers from February\r\nuntil fall, when public opinion finally forced the Administration\r\nto send General Otis an adequate force, is slurred by Secretary of\r\nWar Root in his report for 1899. I do not mean that it was slurred\r\nintentionally. But the Philippines were a long way off, and Mr. Root\r\nand Mr. McKinley naturally relied for their information on their\r\ncommanding general on the spot. There were gallant deeds done in the\r\nPhilippines by those Western fellows of the State regiments which\r\nvolunteered for the war with Spain, that would have made the little\r\nfighting around Santiago look like--well, to borrow from \"Chimmie\"\r\nFadden's fertile vocabulary, \"like 30 cents.\" But General Otis was\r\nnot in a position to get the thrill of such things from his office\r\nwindow, so very few of them were given much prominence by him in his\r\ndespatches to the Adjutant-General of the army. This was wise enough\r\nfrom a political standpoint, seeing that a presidential campaign\r\nwas to ensue in 1900 predicated on the proposition that American\r\nsovereignty was \"in accord with the wishes and aspirations of the\r\ngreat mass of the Filipinos,\" to use the words of the President's\r\nmessage to Congress of December, 1899.\r\n\r\nCaloocan was taken by General MacArthur on February 10th. The natural\r\nline of advance thereafter was of course up the railroad, because\r\nthe insurgents held it, and needed it as much as we would. Throughout\r\nFebruary there were engagements too numerous to mention. The navy also\r\nentertained the enemy whenever he came too near the shores of Manila\r\nBay. One incident in particular is worthy of note, and worthy of\r\nthe best traditions of the navy. I refer to the conduct of Assistant\r\nEngineer Emory Winship off Malabon, March 4, 1899. Malabon is five\r\nmiles north of Manila, on the bay, not far from Caloocan. On the day\r\nnamed, a landing party of 125 men from the U. S. S. Bennington went\r\nashore near Malabon to make photographs, in aid of navy gunnery, of\r\ncertain entrenchments and buildings that had been struck by shells\r\nfrom the Monadnock. They foolishly failed to throw out scouts ahead\r\nof their column, and were suddenly greeted with a withering fire from\r\na whole regiment of insurgents who had seen them first and lain in\r\nwait for them. They retired with considerably more haste than they\r\nhad gone forth. The insurgents advanced, firing, at double quick,\r\ntoward the comparative handful of Americans, and would undoubtedly\r\nhave killed the last man jack of them, but Engineer Winship, who\r\nhad been left in charge of the tug that brought the landing party\r\nshoreward, to keep up steam, saw the situation and promptly met it. He\r\nunlimbered a 37mm. Hotchkiss revolving machine gun which stood in\r\nthe bow of the tug, and opened up with accurate aim on the advancing\r\nregiment of Filipinos. Naturally he at once became a more important\r\ntarget than the retreating body. Nevertheless, he kept pumping lead\r\ninto that long howling murderous advancing brown line until, when\r\nwithin two hundred yards of where the tug lay, the line recoiled and\r\nretreated, and the landing party got safely back to the ship. It was,\r\nliterally, a case of saving the lives of more than a hundred men,\r\nby fearless promptness and dogged tenacity in the intelligent and\r\nskilful performance of duty. The awnings of the tug were torn in\r\nshreds by the enemy's rain of bullets, and her woodwork was much\r\npeppered. Winship was hit five times, and still carries the bullets\r\nin his body, having been retired on account of disability resulting\r\ntherefrom, after being promoted in recognition of his work.\r\n\r\nSoon after March 25th, General MacArthur, commanding the Second\r\nDivision of the Eighth Army Corps, advanced from Caloocan up the\r\nrailroad to Malolos, the insurgent capital, some twenty miles\r\naway. Malolos was taken March 31st. Our February killed were six\r\nofficers and seventy-one enlisted men, total seventy-seven, and a total\r\nof 378 wounded. By the end of March the list swelled to twelve officers\r\nand 127 enlisted men killed, total 139, and a total of 881 wounded,\r\nmaking our total casualties, as reported April 1st, 1020. Also 15%\r\nof the command, or about 2500, were on sick report on that date from\r\nheat prostrations and the like. [217] For these and other reasons,\r\nfarther advance up the railroad was halted for a while.\r\n\r\nMeantime, General Lawton, with his staff, consisting of Colonel\r\nEdwards, Major Starr, and Captains King and Sewall, \"the big four\" they\r\nwere called, had come out from New York City by way of the Suez Canal,\r\nbringing most welcome reinforcements, the 4th and 17th Infantry. These\r\npeople arrived between the 10th and the 22d of March. What happened\r\nsoon after, as a result of their arrival, must now become for a brief\r\nmoment, a part of the panorama, the lay of the land General Lawton\r\nfirst swept over being first indicated.\r\n\r\nLuzon is practically bisected, east and west, by the Pasig River\r\nand a lake out of which it flows almost due west into Manila Bay,\r\nManila being at the mouth of the river. Under the Spaniards,\r\nall Luzon north of the Pasig had been one military district and\r\nall Luzon south of the Pasig another. The Eighth Army Corps always\r\nspoke of northern Luzon as \"the north line,\" and of southern Luzon as\r\n\"the south line.\" The lake above mentioned is called the Laguna de\r\nBay. It is nearly as big as Manila Bay, which last is called twenty\r\nodd miles wide by thirty long. On the map, the Laguna de Bay roughly\r\nresembles a half-moon, the man in which looks north, the western\r\nhorn being near Manila, and the eastern near the Pacific coast of\r\nLuzon. General Otis had learned that at a place called Santa Cruz,\r\ntoward the eastern end of the Laguna de Bay, there were a lot of steam\r\nlaunches and a Spanish gun-boat, which, if captured, would prove\r\ninvaluable for river fighting and transportation of supplies along\r\nthe Rio Grande de Pampanga and the other streams that watered the\r\ngreat central plain through which the railroad ran and which would\r\nhave to be occupied later. So as soon as possible after General\r\nLawton arrived and the necessary men could be spared, he was sent\r\nwith 1500 troops to seize and bring back the boats in question. Of\r\ncourse the country he should overrun would have to be overrun again,\r\nbecause there were not troops enough to spare to garrison and hold\r\nit. But for the present, the launches would help. This expedition was\r\nsuccessful, leaving the head of the lake nearest Manila on April 9th,\r\nand returning April 17th. It met with some good hard fighting on the\r\nway, sweeping everything before it of course, inflicting considerable\r\nloss, and suffering some. General Lawton's report mentions, among\r\nother officers whose conspicuous gallantry and efficiency in action\r\nattracted his attention, Colonel Clarence R. Edwards, now Chief of\r\nthe Bureau of Insular Affairs of the War Department, of whose conduct\r\nin the capture of Santa Cruz on the morning of April 10th, he says:\r\n\"No line of battle could have been more courageously or intelligently\r\nled.\" [218] The resistance was pretty real to Colonel Edwards then,\r\ni.e., the Benevolent Assimilation was quite strenuous, and it continued\r\nto be so until his great commander was shot through the breast in the\r\nforefront of battle in the hour of victory in December thereafter,\r\nand the colonel came home with the general's body. Since then the\r\ncolonel has soldiered no more, but has remained on duty at Washington,\r\nthe birthplace of the original theory that the Filipinos welcomed our\r\nrule, charged with the duty of yearning over the erring Filipino who\r\nthinks he can govern himself but is mistaken, and also with the still\r\nmore difficult task of trying to live up to the original theory as\r\nfar as circumstances will permit. As a matter of fact, the Filipinos\r\nwould probably have gotten along much better than the Cubans if we\r\nhad let General Lawton do there what he and General Wood were set to\r\nwork doing in Cuba shortly after Santiago fell. Public opinion is a\r\nvery dangerous thing to trifle with, and when, in September, 1899,\r\nthere was a story going the rounds of the American newspapers that\r\nLawton, the hero of El Caney, the man who had reflected more glory\r\non American arms in striking the shackles of Spain from Cuba than any\r\nother one soldier in the army, had called the war in the Philippines\r\n\"this accursed war,\" the War Department got busy over the cable to\r\nGeneral Otis and obtained from him a denial that General Lawton had\r\nmade such a remark. But the public knew its Lawton and what he had done\r\nin Cuba, and had a suspicion there might be some truth in the rumor. So\r\nthe War Department cabled out saying \"Newspapers say Lawton's denial\r\ninsufficient,\" and then repeating the words attributed to him. So\r\nGeneral Otis sent another denial that filled the bill. [219] Of course\r\nGeneral Lawton made no such remark. He was too good a soldier. It would\r\nhave demoralized his whole command. But I served under him in both\r\nhemispheres, and I will always believe that he had a certain amount\r\nof regret at having to fight the Filipinos to keep them from having\r\nindependence, when they were a so much likelier lot, take it all in\r\nall, than the Cubans we saw about Santiago. Moreover, I believe that\r\nhad it not been then too late to ask him, he would have subscribed\r\nto the opinion Admiral Dewey had cabled home the previous summer:\r\n\"These people are far superior in their intelligence and more capable\r\nof self-government than the natives of Cuba, and I am familiar with\r\nboth races.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the expedition down the lake, General Lawton went on \"The North\r\nLine.\" So let us now turn thither also. For wherever Lawton was,\r\nthere was fighting.\r\n\r\nIn the latter half of April, General MacArthur advanced north along the\r\nrailroad, and took Calumpit, where the railroad crosses the Rio Grande,\r\non April 28th. This was the place where under cover of \"the accurate\r\nconcentrated fire of the guns of the Utah Light Artillery commanded by\r\nMajor Young\" [220] a few Kansas men with ropes tied to their bodies\r\nswam the river in the face of a heavy fire from the enemy, fastened\r\nthe ropes to some boats on the enemy's side, and were pulled back\r\nin the boats, by their comrades, to the side they had come from; the\r\nKansans then crossing the river under the lead of the gallant Funston,\r\nand driving the enemy from his trenches. The desperate bravery of\r\nthe performance, like so many other things General Funston did in the\r\nPhilippines, was so superb that one forgets how contrary it was to all\r\nknown rules of the game of war. If it was Providence that saved Funston\r\nand his Kansans from annihilation, certainly Providence was ably\r\nassisted on that occasion by Major Young and his Utah Battery. [221]\r\n\r\nShortly after this General MacArthur entered San Fernando, the second\r\ninsurgent capital, which is forty miles or so up the railroad from\r\nManila.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of May General Lawton kept the insurgents busy to\r\nthe east of the railroad, between it and the Pacific coast range,\r\ntaking San Isidro, whither the third insurgent capital was moved after\r\nMalolos fell, on May 17th. Here he made his headquarters for a time,\r\nas did General MacArthur at San Fernando.\r\n\r\nIt had been supposed that practically the whole body of the insurgent\r\narmy was concentrated in the country to the north of Manila, but this\r\nproved a mistake. They now began to threaten Manila from the country\r\nsouth of the Pasig. Says General Otis:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The enemy had become again boldly demonstrative at the South and\r\n    it became necessary to throw him back once more. [222]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Lawton was directed to concentrate his troops in the country\r\nabout San Isidro, turn them over to the command of some one else,\r\nand come to Manila to organize for a campaign on the south line. The\r\ndetails of this expedition belong to a military history, which this\r\nis not. The expedition left its initial point of concentration near\r\nManila on June 9th. Its great event was the battle of Zapote River on\r\nJune 13th. Along this river in 1896 the insurgents had gained a great\r\nvictory over the Spaniards. They had trenches on the farther side of\r\nthe river which they deemed impregnable. General Lawton attacked them\r\nin these intrenchments June 13th. At three o'clock that afternoon\r\nhe wired General Otis at Manila giving him an idea of the battle\r\nand stating that the enemy was fighting in strong force and with\r\ndetermination. At 3:30 o'clock he wired:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are having a beautiful battle. Hurry up ammunition; we will\r\n    need it;\r\n\r\n\r\nand at 4 o'clock:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have the bridge. It has cost us dearly. Battle not yet over. It\r\n    is a battle however. [223]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in this battle of Zapote River that Lieutenant William L. Kenly,\r\nof the regular artillery, did what was perhaps the finest single bit\r\nof soldier work of the whole war, [224] in recognition of which his\r\nconduct in the battle was characterized as \"magnificent\" by so thorough\r\na soldier as General Lawton, who recommended him to be brevetted for\r\ndistinguished gallantry in the presence of the enemy, with this remark:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As General Ovenshine says, speaking of Lieutenant Kenly and\r\n    his battery, \"This is probably the first time in history that a\r\n    battery has been advanced and fought without cover within thirty\r\n    yards of strongly manned trenches.\" [225]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor what he did on that occasion, Kenly ought to have had a medal\r\nof honor, which, except life insurance and a good education, is the\r\nfinest legacy any government can enable a soldier to bequeath to his\r\nchildren. If the war had been backed by the sentiment of the whole\r\ncountry, as the Spanish War was, he would have gotten it. As it was,\r\nthe only thing he ever got for it, so far as the writer is advised,\r\nwas to have his name spelt wrong in an account of the incident in\r\nthe only book wherein there has yet been attempted a record of the\r\nmany deeds of splendid daring that marked the only war into which\r\nthis nation ever blundered. [226]\r\n\r\nWhile there were divers and sundry movements of our troops hither\r\nand thither, and much sacrifice of life, after General Lawton's\r\nZapote River campaign in June, no substantial progress was made in\r\nconquering and occupying the Islands until the fall following the\r\nZapote River campaign above mentioned, when the twenty-five regiments\r\nof volunteers were organized and sent out. All that was done until\r\nthen, after the capture of San Fernando, may be summed up broadly,\r\nby saying that we protected Manila and held the railroad, as far as\r\nwe had fought our way up it. It is true that the city of Iloilo had\r\nbeen occupied on February 11th, the city of Cebu shortly afterward,\r\nthe island of Negros, an oasis of comparative quiet in a great desert\r\nof hostility, a little later; also that a small Spanish garrison at\r\nthe little port of Jolo in the Mohammedan country near Borneo had\r\nalso been relieved by a small American force on the 19th of May. But\r\nthese irresolute movements accomplished nothing except to deprive\r\nour force at the front of about 4000 men and to awaken the Visayan\r\nIslands to active and thorough organization against us.\r\n\r\nPreparatory to an understanding of the fall campaign, in which\r\npatchwork and piecemeal warfare was superseded by the real thing, it\r\nwill now be necessary to consider the political--or let us call it,\r\nthe politico-military--aspect of the first half year of the war.\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis's folly had led him to advise Washington as early as\r\nNovember, 1898, that he could get along with 25,000 troops, [227]\r\nand the Otis under-estimate of the resistance we would meet if we\r\ntook the Islands had undoubtedly influenced Mr. McKinley in deciding\r\nto take them. Twenty-five thousand troops was only 5000 more than\r\nGeneral Otis had with him at the time he made the recommendation, and\r\nsignified that he was not expecting trouble. The Treaty of Paris was\r\nsigned on December 10, 1898, and on December 16th, President McKinley's\r\nSecretary of War informed Congress that 25,000 troops would be enough\r\nfor the Philippines. [228] When the treaty was ratified February 6,\r\n1899, the war in the Philippines had already broken out. On March 2,\r\n1899, two days before the 55th Congress expired, in fact on the very\r\nday that Congress appropriated the $20,000,000 to pay Spain for the\r\nIslands, an act was passed authorizing the President to enlist 35,000\r\nvolunteers to put down the insurrection in the Islands. The term\r\nof enlistment of these volunteers was to expire June 30, 1901. As\r\nthe New Thought people would say \"Hold the Thought!\" June 30, 1901,\r\nis the end of our government's fiscal year. That date, the date of\r\nexpiration of the enlistment of the volunteer army raised under the\r\nact of March 2, 1899, is a convenient key to the whole history of the\r\nAmerican occupation of the Philippines since the outbreak of our war\r\nwith the Filipinos, February 4, 1899, including the titanic efforts of\r\nthe McKinley Administration in the latter half of 1899 and the first\r\nhalf of 1900 to retrieve the Otis blunders; the premature resumption\r\nby Judge Taft, during and in aid of Mr. McKinley's campaign for the\r\nPresidency in 1900, of the original McKinley Benevolent Assimilation\r\nprogramme, on the theory, already wholly exploded by a long and bitter\r\nwar, that the great majority of the people welcomed American rule and\r\nhad only been coerced into opposing us; and the premature setting up\r\nof the Civil Government on July 4, 1901. No candid mind seeking only\r\nthe truth of history can fail to see that when President McKinley\r\nsent the Taft Commission to the Philippines in the spring of 1900,\r\npart of their problem was to facilitate Mr. McKinley in avoiding later\r\non any further call for volunteers to take the place of those whose\r\nterms would expire June 30, 1901. The amount of force that has been\r\nneeded to saddle our government firmly on the Filipino people is the\r\nonly honest test by which to examine the claim that it is unto them\r\nas Castoria unto children. In February, 1899, the dogs of war being\r\nalready let loose, President McKinley had resumed his now wholly\r\nimpossible Benevolent Assimilation programme, by sending out the\r\nSchurman Commission, which was the prototype of the Taft Commission,\r\nto yearningly explain our intentions to the insurgents, and to make\r\nclear to them how unqualifiedly benevolent those intentions were. The\r\nscheme was like trying to put salt on a bird's tail after you have\r\nflushed him. This commission was headed by President Schurman, of\r\nCornell University. It arrived in March, armed with instructions\r\nas benevolent in their rhetoric as any the Filipinos had ever read\r\nin the days of our predecessors in sovereignty, the Spaniards. And\r\nthe commission were of course duly astounded that their publication\r\nhad no effect. The Filipinos in Manila tore them down as soon as\r\nthey were put up. The instructions clothed the commission with\r\nauthority to yield every point in issue except the only one in\r\ndispute--Independence. On this alone they were firm. But so were\r\nthe people who had already submitted the issue to the arbitrament\r\nof war. Of course the Schurman Commission, therefore, accomplished\r\nnothing. It held frequent communication with the enemy in the field\r\nand came near an open rupture with General Otis, who was nominally a\r\nmember of it. But even that unwise man knew war when he saw it, and\r\nknew the futility of trying to mix peace with war. War being hell,\r\nthe sooner 'tis over the better for all concerned. After Professor\r\nSchurman had been quite optimistically explaining our intentions for\r\nabout three months, under the tragically mistaken notion Mr. McKinley\r\nhad originally derived from General Otis that the insurrection had\r\nbeen brought about by \"the sinister ambition of a few leaders,\"\r\n[229] General Otis wired Washington, on June 4th, \"Negotiations and\r\nconferences with insurgent leaders cost soldiers' lives and prolong our\r\ndifficulties,\" [230] adding with regard to the Schurman Commission:\r\n\"Ostensibly it will be supported * * * here, and to the outside\r\nworld gentle peace shall prevail,\" but intimating that he would be\r\nvery much gratified if the Department would allow him to handle the\r\nenemy, and stop Dr. Schurman from having their leaders come in under\r\nflags of truce to parley. After that Dr. Schurman's activities seem\r\nto have been confined to the less mischievous business of gathering\r\nstatistics. His mistake was simply the one he had brought with him,\r\nderived from President McKinley. He came back home, however, thoroughly\r\nsatisfied that the Filipinos did of a verity want the independence\r\nthey were fighting for, and quite as sure that republics should not\r\nhave colonies as General Anderson's experience had previously made\r\nhim. It has long been known throughout the length and breadth of the\r\nUnited States that Dr. Schurman is in favor of Philippine independence.\r\n\r\nOn June 26th, just thirteen days after the Zapote River fight had\r\nstopped the insurgents on the south line from threatening almost the\r\nvery gates of the city of Manila itself, General Otis had another\r\nattack of optimism. On that date he wired Washington: \"Insurgent cause\r\nmay collapse at any time.\" [231] Finally, the war correspondents at\r\nManila, wearied with the military press censorship whereby General\r\nOtis had so long kept the situation from the people at home, with his\r\neternal \"situation-well-in-hand\" telegrams, got together, inspired no\r\ndoubt by the example of the Roosevelt round robin that had rescued the\r\nFifth Army Corps from Cuba after the fighting down there, and prepared\r\na round robin of their own--a protest against further misrepresentation\r\nof the facts. This they of course knew General Otis would not let\r\nthem cable home. However, they asked his permission to do so, the\r\ncommittee appointed to beard the lion in his den being O. K. Davis,\r\nJohn T. McCutcheon, Robert Collins, and John F. Bass. General Otis\r\nthreatened to \"put them off the island.\" This did not bother them in\r\nthe least. General Otis told the War Department afterwards that he\r\ndid not punish them because they were \"courting martyrdom,\" or words\r\nto that effect. As a matter of fact, they were merely determined that\r\nthe American people should know the facts. That of \"putting them off\r\nthe island\" was just a fussy phrase of \"Mother\" Otis, long familiar to\r\nthem. They were under his jurisdiction. But they were Americans, and\r\nreputable gentlemen, and he knew he was responsible for their right\r\ntreatment. After General Otis had duly put the expected veto on the\r\nproposed cablegram of protest, the newspaper men sent their protest\r\nover to Hong Kong by mail, and had it cabled to the United States from\r\nthere. It was published in the newspapers of this country July 17,\r\n1899. A copy of it may be found in any public library which keeps\r\nthe bound copies of the great magazines, in the Review of Reviews\r\nfor August, 1899, pp. 137-8. It read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The undersigned, being all staff correspondents of American\r\n    newspapers stationed in Manila, unite in the following statement:\r\n\r\n    We believe that, owing to official despatches from Manila made\r\n    public in Washington, the people of the United States have not\r\n    received a correct impression of the situation in the Philippines,\r\n    but that those despatches have presented an ultra-optimistic view\r\n    that is not shared by the general officers in the field.\r\n\r\n    We believe the despatches incorrectly represent the existing\r\n    conditions among the Filipinos in respect to internal dissension\r\n    and demoralization resulting from the American campaign and to\r\n    the brigand character of their army.\r\n\r\n    We believe the despatches err in the declaration that \"the\r\n    situation is well in hand,\" and in the assumption that the\r\n    insurrection can be speedily ended without a greatly increased\r\n    force.\r\n\r\n    We think the tenacity of the Filipino purpose has been\r\n    under-estimated, and that the statements are unfounded that\r\n    volunteers are willing to engage in further service.\r\n\r\n    The censorship has compelled us to participate in this\r\n    misrepresentation by excising or altering uncontroverted statements\r\n    of facts on the plea that \"they would alarm the people at home,\"\r\n    or \"have the people of the United States by the ears.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men of the pen had been so long under military rule and had seen\r\nso much of courts-martial that their document savored of military\r\njurisprudence. After making the above charges, it set forth what it\r\ncalled \"specifications.\" These were:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Prohibition of hospital reports; suppression of full reports\r\n    of field operations in the event of failure; numbers of heat\r\n    prostrations in the field; systematic minimization of naval\r\n    operations; and suppression of complete reports of the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe paper was signed by John T. McCutcheon and Harry Armstrong,\r\nrepresenting the Chicago Record; O. K. Davis and P. G. MacDonnell,\r\nrepresenting the New York Sun; Robert M. Collins, John P. Dunning,\r\nand L. Jones, representing the Associated Press; John F. Bass and\r\nWilliam Dinwiddie, representing the New York Herald; E. D. Skeene,\r\nrepresenting the Scripps-McRae Association; and Richard Little,\r\nrepresenting the Chicago Tribune. Mr. Collins, the Associated Press\r\nrepresentative, wrote his people an account of this whole episode,\r\nwhich was also given wide publicity. After describing the committee's\r\ninterview with the General down to a certain point, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But when General Otis came down to the frank admission that it\r\n    was his purpose to keep the knowledge of conditions here from the\r\n    public at home, and when the censor had repeatedly told us, in\r\n    ruling out plain statements of undisputed facts, \"My instructions\r\n    are to let nothing go that can hurt the Administration,\" we\r\n    concluded that protest was justifiable.\r\n\r\n\r\nCollins had written what he considered a conservative review of\r\nthe situation in June, saying reinforcements were needed. Of the\r\nsuppression of this he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The censor's comment (I made a note of it) was: \"Of course we all\r\n    know that we are in a terrible mess out here, but we don't want the\r\n    people to get excited about it. If you fellows will only keep quiet\r\n    now we will pull through in time [232] without any fuss at home!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Collins's letter proceeds: \"When I went to see him [Otis] he\r\nrepeated the same old story about the insurrection going to pieces.\"\r\n\r\nAs to the charge of suppressing the real condition of our sick in\r\nthe hospitals, Mr. Collins says that General Otis remarked that the\r\n\"hospitals were full of perfectly well men who were shirking and should\r\nbe turned out.\" On June 2, 1899, according to General Otis's report\r\n(p. 121), sixty per cent. of one of the State volunteer regiments\r\nwere in hospital sick or wounded and there were in its ranks an\r\naverage of but eight men to a company fit for duty. The report of\r\nthe regimental surgeon stating this was forwarded by General Otis\r\nto Washington with the comment that there were few cases of serious\r\nillness; that the then \"present station of these troops\"--the place\r\nwhere the fighting was hottest, San Fernando--\"is considered by the\r\nFilipinos as a health resort,\" and that \"when orders to take passage\r\nto the United States are issued, both the Montana and South Dakota\r\ntroops will recover with astonishing rapidity.\" [233]\r\n\r\nThis round robin of course produced a profound sensation in the United\r\nStates. It was just what the American public had long suspected was\r\nthe case. Shortly afterward Secretary of War Alger resigned. Coming\r\nas it did on the heels of the scandal about \"embalmed beef\" having\r\nbeen furnished to the army in Cuba, it made him too much of a load\r\nfor the Administration to carry. He was succeeded by Mr. Root,\r\nan eminent member of the New York Bar, whose masterful mind soon\r\nsaw the essentials of the situation and proceeded to get a volunteer\r\narmy recruited, equipped, and sent to the Philippines without further\r\nunnecessary delay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nOTIS AND THE WAR (Continued)\r\n\r\n              And now, a man of head being at the centre of it,\r\n              the whole matter gets vital.--Carlyle's French Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can surely be little doubt in any quarter that Mr. Root is, in\r\nintellectual endowment and equipment at least, one of the greatest,\r\nif he is not the greatest, of living American statesmen. Mankind will\r\nalways yield due acclaim to men who, in great emergencies, see the\r\nessentials of a given situation, and at once proceed to get the thing\r\ndone that ought to be done. Whether the war in the Philippines was\r\nregrettable or not, it had become, by midsummer of 1899, supremely\r\nimportant, from any rational and patriotic standpoint, to end it as\r\nsoon as possible.\r\n\r\nMr. Root had not been in office as Secretary of War very long before\r\nfleets of troop-ships, carrying some twenty-five well-equipped\r\nvolunteer regiments, [234] were swarming out of New York harbor\r\nbound for Manila by way of the Suez Canal, and out of the Golden\r\nGate for the same destination via Honolulu. Nor was there any\r\nconfusion as in the Cuban helter-skelter. Everything went as if by\r\nclockwork. Moreover, along with the new and ample force, went a clear,\r\nmasterly, comprehensive plan of campaign, prepared, not by General\r\nOtis at Manila, but in the War Department at Washington, by officers\r\nalready familiar with the islands.\r\n\r\nIt was the purpose of this government at last to demonstrate\r\nconclusively to the Filipino people that the representative of the\r\nUnited States at Manila was \"the boss of the show,\" and that Aguinaldo\r\nwas not--a demonstration then sorely needed by the exigencies of\r\nAmerican prestige. The purpose can readily be appreciated, but to\r\nunderstand the plan of campaign, and the method of its execution,\r\nsomewhat of the geography of Luzon must now be considered. Before\r\nwe approach the shores of Luzon and the city of Manila, however,\r\nlet us consider from a distance, in a bird's-eye view, as it were,\r\nthe relation of Luzon to the rest of the archipelago, so as to know,\r\nin a comprehensive way, what we are \"going out for to see.\" We may as\r\nwell pause at this point, long enough to learn all we will ever need to\r\nknow, for the purposes of the scope of this narrative, concerning the\r\ngeneral geography of the Philippine archipelago, and the governmental\r\nproblems it presents. (See folding map at end of volume.)\r\n\r\nIt is a common saying that Paris is France. In the same sense Manila\r\nis the Philippines. In fact, the latter expression is more accurate\r\nthan the former, for Manila, besides being the capital city of the\r\ncountry, and its chief port, is a city of over 200,000 people, while\r\nno one of the two or three cities next to it in rank in population\r\nhad more than 20,000. [235] By parity of reasoning it may be said that\r\nLuzon was the Philippines, so far as the problem which confronted us\r\nwhen we went there was concerned, relatively both to the original\r\nconception in 1898 of the struggle for independence, its birth in\r\n1899, its life, and its slow, lingering obstinate death in 1900-1902,\r\nin which last year the insurrection was finally correctly stated\r\nto be practically ended. To know just how and why this was true,\r\nis necessary to a clear understanding of that struggle, including\r\nnot only its genesis and its exodus, but also its gospels, its acts,\r\nits revelations, and the multitudinous subsequent commentaries thereon.\r\n\r\nThe total land area of the Philippine archipelago, according to the\r\nAmerican Census of 1903, is 115,000 square miles. [236] The area of\r\nLuzon, the principal island, on which Manila is situated, is 41,000\r\nsquare miles, and that of Mindanao, the only other large island, is\r\n36,000. [237] Between these two large islands, Luzon on the north,\r\nand Mindanao on the south, there are a number of smaller ones,\r\nbut acquaintance with only six of these is essential to a clear\r\nunderstanding of the American occupation. Many Americans, too busy\r\nto have paid much attention to the Philippine Islands, which are,\r\nand must ever remain, a thing wholly apart from American life, have a\r\nvague notion that there are several thousand of them. This is true, in\r\na way. American energy has made, for the first time in their history,\r\nan actual count of them, \"including everything which at high tide\r\nappeared as a separate island.\" [238] The work was done for our Census\r\nof 1903 by Mr. George R. Putnam, now head of the Lighthouse Board of\r\nthe United States. Mr. Putnam, counted 3141 of them. [239] Of these,\r\nof course, many--many hundred perhaps--are merely rocks fit only for a\r\nresting place for birds. 2775, have an area of less than a square mile\r\neach, 262 have an area of between 1 and 10 square miles, 73 between 10\r\nand 100 square miles, and 20 between 100 and 1000 square miles. This\r\naccounts for, and may dismiss at once from consideration 3130--all but\r\n11. Most of these 3130 that are large enough to demand even so much\r\nas a single word here are poorly adapted to human habitation, being\r\nin most instances, without good harbors or other landing places, and\r\nusually covered either with dense jungle or inhospitable mountains, or\r\nboth. Their total area is only about 8500 square miles, of the 115,500\r\nsquare miles of land in the archipelago. None of them have ever had\r\nany political significance, either in Spain's time, or our own, and\r\ntherefore, the whole 3130 may at once be eliminated from consideration,\r\nleaving 11 only requiring any special notice at all--the 11 largest\r\nislands. Of these, Luzon and Mindanao have already been mentioned. The\r\nremaining 9, with their respective areas and populations, are:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Island                Area [240]        Population [241]\r\n                          in Square Miles\r\n\r\n    Panay                 4,611               743,646\r\n    Negros                4,881               560,776\r\n    Cebu                  1,762               592,247\r\n    Bohol                 1,411               243,148\r\n    Samar                 5,031               222,690\r\n    Leyte                 2,722 [242]         357,641\r\n    Mindoro               3,851                28,361\r\n    Masbate               1,236                29,451\r\n    Paragua               4,027 [243]          10,918\r\n                         ------             ---------\r\n         Total           29,532             2,788,878\r\n\r\n\r\nThe political or governmental problem being now reduced from 3141\r\nislands to eleven, the last three of the nine contained in the above\r\ntable may also be eliminated as follows: (See map at end of volume.)\r\n\r\nParagua, the long narrow island seen at the extreme lower left of any\r\nmap of the archipelago, extending northeast southwest at an angle\r\nof about 45 deg., is practically worthless, being fit for nothing much\r\nexcept a penal colony, for which purpose it is in fact now used.\r\n\r\nMasbate--easily located on the map at a glance, because the twelfth\r\nparallel of north latitude intersects the 124th meridian of longitude\r\neast of Greenwich in its southeast corner--though noted for cattle\r\nand other quadrupeds, is not essential to a clear understanding of\r\nthe human problem in its broader governmental aspects.\r\n\r\nMindoro, the large island just south of the main bulk of Luzon,\r\npierced by the 121st meridian of longitude east of Greenwich, is\r\nthick with densely wooded mountains and jungle over a large part\r\nof its area, has a reputation of being very unhealthy (malarious),\r\nis also very sparsely settled, and does not now, nor has it ever,\r\ncut any figure politically, as a disturbing factor. [244]\r\n\r\nEliminating Paragua, Masbate, and Mindoro as not essential to a\r\nsubstantially correct general idea of the strategic and governmental\r\nproblems presented by the Philippine Islands, we have left, besides\r\nLuzon and Mindanao, nothing but the half-dozen islands which appear\r\nin large type in the above table: Panay, Negros, Cebu, Bohol, Samar,\r\nLeyte, with a total area of 20,500 square miles. Add these to Luzon's\r\n41,000 square miles and Mindanao's 36,000, and you have the Philippine\r\narchipelago as we are to consider it in this book, that is to say,\r\ntwo big islands with a half dozen little ones in between, the eight\r\nhaving a total area of 97,500 square miles, of which the two big\r\nislands represent nearly four-fifths.\r\n\r\nWhile the great Mohammedan island of Mindanao, near Borneo, with\r\nits 36,000 square miles [245] of area, requires that the Philippine\r\narchipelago be described as stretching over more than 1000 miles\r\nfrom north to south, still, inasmuch as Mindanao only contains\r\nabout 500,000 people all told, [246] half of them semi-civilized,\r\n[247] the governmental problem it presents has no more to do with\r\nthe main problem of whether, if ever, we are to grant independence\r\nto the 7,000,000 Christians of the other islands, than the questions\r\nthat have to be passed on by our Commissioner of Indian Affairs have\r\nto do with the tariff.\r\n\r\nMindanao's 36,000 square miles constitute nearly a third of\r\nthe total area of the Philippine archipelago, and more than that\r\nfraction of the 97,500 square miles of territory to a consideration\r\nof which our attention is reduced by the process of elimination\r\nabove indicated. Turning over Mindanao to those crudely Mohammedan,\r\nsemi-civilized Moros would indeed be \"like granting self-government\r\nto an Apache reservation under some local chief,\" as Mr. Roosevelt,\r\nin the campaign of 1900, ignorantly declared it would be to grant\r\nself-government to Luzon under Aguinaldo. [248] Furthermore, the Moros,\r\nso far as they can think, would prefer to owe allegiance to, and be\r\nentitled to recognition as subjects of, some great nation. [249]\r\nAgain, because, the Filipinos have no moral right to control\r\nthe Moros, and could not if they would, the latter being fierce\r\nfighters and bitterly opposed to the thought of possible ultimate\r\ndomination by the Filipinos, the most uncompromising advocate of\r\nthe consent-of-the-governed principle has not a leg to stand on\r\nwith regard to Mohammedan Mindanao. Hence I affirm that as to it,\r\nwe have a distinct and separate problem, which cannot be solved\r\nin the lifetime of anybody now living. But it is a problem which\r\nneed not in the least delay the advent of independence for the\r\nother fourteen-fifteenths of the inhabitants of the archipelago\r\n[250]--all Christians living on islands north of Mindanao. It is\r\ntrue that there are some Christian Filipinos on Mindanao, but in\r\npolicing the Moros, our government would of course protect them from\r\nthe Moros. If they did not like our government, they could move to\r\nsuch parts of the island as we might permit to be incorporated in an\r\nultimate Philippine republic. Inasmuch as the 300,000 or so Moros of\r\nthe Mohammedan island of Mindanao and the adjacent islets called Jolo\r\n(the \"Sulu Archipelago,\" so called, \"reigned over\" by the Sultan of\r\ncomic opera fame) originally presented, as they will always present,\r\na distinct and separate problem, and never did have anything more\r\nto do with the Philippine insurrection against us than their cousins\r\nand co-religionists over in nearby Borneo, the task which confronted\r\nMr. Root in the fall of 1899, to wit, the suppression of the Philippine\r\ninsurrection, meant, practically, the subjugation of one big island,\r\nLuzon, containing half the population and one-third the total area of\r\nthe archipelago, and six neighboring smaller ones, the Visayan Islands.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us concentrate our attention upon Luzon as Mr. Root\r\nno doubt did, with infinite pains, in the fall of 1899. Of the\r\n7,600,000 people of the Philippines [251] almost exactly one-half,\r\ni.e., 3,800,000, [252] live on Luzon, and these are practically all\r\ncivilized. [253] It so happens that the State of our Union which is\r\nnearer the size of Luzon than any other is the one which furnished\r\nthe first American Civil Governor for the Philippine Islands, Governor\r\nTaft. President Taft's native State of Ohio is 41,061 square miles in\r\narea, and Luzon is 40,969. [254] Roughly speaking, Luzon may also be\r\nsaid to be about the size of Cuba, [255] though it is about twice as\r\nthickly populated as the latter, Cuba, having something over 2,000,000\r\npeople to Luzon's nearly 4,000,000. [256]\r\n\r\nBy all Americans in the Philippines since our occupation, the island\r\nof Luzon is always contemplated as consisting of two parts, to wit,\r\nnorthern Luzon, or that part north of Manila, and southern Luzon,\r\nthe part south of Manila. The great central plain of Luzon, lying\r\njust north of Manila, is nearly as large as the republic of Salvador,\r\nor the State of New Jersey, i.e., in the neighborhood of 7000 square\r\nmiles area [257]--and, like Salvador, it contains a population of\r\nsomething over 1,000,000 inhabitants. The area and population of the\r\nfive provinces of this plain are, according to the Philippine Census\r\nof 1903, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province              Area [258] (sq. m.)    Population [259]\r\n\r\n    Pangasinan            1,193                      397,902\r\n    Pampanga                868                      223,754\r\n    Bulacan               1,173                      223,742\r\n    Tarlac                1,205                      135,107\r\n    Nueva Ecija           1,950                      134,147\r\n                          -----                    ---------\r\n                          6,389                    1,114,652\r\n\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the central plain comprising the above five provinces\r\nis bounded as follows: On the north by mountains and Lingayen Gulf, on\r\nthe east by a coast range of mountains separating it from the Pacific\r\nOcean, on the west by a similar range separating it from the China\r\nSea, and on the south by Manila Bay and mountains. The Rio Grande de\r\nPampanga flows obliquely across it in a southwesterly direction into\r\nManila Bay, and near its western edge runs the railroad from Manila\r\nto Dagupan on Lingayen gulf. Dagupan is 120 miles from Manila. This\r\nplain, held by a well-equipped insurgent army backed by the moral\r\nsupport of the whole population, became the theatre of war as soon\r\nas the volunteers of 1899 began to arrive at Manila, the insurgent\r\ncapital being then at Tarlac, a place about two-thirds of the way up\r\nthe railroad from Manila to Dagupan.\r\n\r\nOf course the first essential thing to do was to break the backbone\r\nof the insurgent army, and scatter it, and the next thing to do was\r\nto capture Aguinaldo, the head and front of the whole business, the\r\nincarnation of the aspirations of the Filipino people. The operations\r\nto this end commenced in October, and involved three movements of\r\nthree separate forces:\r\n\r\n(1) A column under General Lawton, proceeding up the Rio Grande\r\nand along the northeastern borders of the plain, and bending around\r\nwestward along its northern boundary toward the gulf of Lingayen,\r\ngarrisoning the towns en route, and occupying the mountain passes\r\non the northeast which give exit over the divide into the great\r\nvalleys beyond.\r\n\r\n(2) An expedition under General Wheaton, some 2500 in all, proceeding\r\nby transports to the gulf of Lingayen, the chief port of which,\r\nDagupan, was the northern terminus of the railroad; the objective\r\nbeing to land on the shore of that gulf at the northwest corner of\r\nthe plain, occupy the great coast road which runs from that point to\r\nthe northern extremity of the island, and also to proceed eastward\r\nand effect a junction with the Lawton column.\r\n\r\n(3) A third column under General MacArthur, proceeding up the railroad\r\nto the capture of Tarlac, the third insurgent capital, and thence\r\nstill up the railroad to its end at Dagupan, driving the enemy's\r\nforces before it toward the line held by the first two columns.\r\n\r\nOn October 12th, General Lawton moved up the Rio Grande from a place\r\ncalled Aryat, a few miles up stream from where the railroad crosses the\r\nriver at Calumpit, driving the insurgents before him to the northward\r\nand westward. His command was made up mainly from the 3d Cavalry and\r\nthe 22d Infantry, together with several hundred scouts, American and\r\nMaccabebee. On the 20th San Isidro was again captured. That was the\r\nplace Lawton had evacuated in May previous. Arriving in the Islands\r\nwith Colonel E. E. Hardin's regiment, the 29th U. S. Volunteer\r\nInfantry, on November 3, 1899, the writer was immediately detailed\r\nto the Maccabebee scouts, to take the place of Lieutenant Boutelle,\r\nof the regular artillery, a young West Pointer from Oregon, who had\r\nbeen killed a day or two previous, and reported to Major C. G. Starr,\r\nGeneral Lawton's Adjutant-General in the field (whom he had known at\r\nSantiago de Cuba the previous year) at San Isidro on or about November\r\n8th. Major Starr said: \"We took this town last spring,\" stating how\r\nmuch our loss had been in so doing, \"but, partly as a result of the\r\nSchurman Commission parleying with the insurgents General Otis had\r\nus fall back. We have just had to take it again.\" General Lawton\r\ngarrisoned San Isidro this time once for all, and pressed on north,\r\ncapturing the successive towns en route. Meantime, General Young's\r\ncavalry, and the Maccabebee scouts under Major Batson, a lieutenant\r\nof the regular army, and a medal-of-honor graduate of the Santiago\r\ncampaign, were operating to the west of the general line of advance,\r\nstriking insurgent detachments wherever found and driving them toward\r\nthe line of the railroad. By November 13th, Lawton's advance had\r\nturned to the westward, according to the concerted plan of campaign\r\nabove described, garrisoning, as fast as they were taken, such of the\r\ntowns of the country over which he swept as there were troops to spare\r\nfor. We knew that Aguinaldo had been at Tarlac when the advance began,\r\nand every officer and enlisted man of the command was on the qui vive\r\nto catch him. By November 18th, General Lawton's forces held a line of\r\nposts extending up the eastern side of the plain, and curving around\r\nacross the northern end to within a few miles of the gulf of Lingayen.\r\n\r\nOn November 6th, General Wheaton set sail from Manila for Lingayen\r\nGulf, with 2500 men of the 13th Regular and 33d Volunteer Infantry,\r\nand a platoon of the 6th Artillery, convoyed by the ships of the\r\nnavy, and next day the expedition was successfully landed at San\r\nFabian, \"with effective assistance from the naval convoy against\r\nspirited resistance,\" says Secretary of War Root, in his annual\r\nreport for 1899. The navy's assistance on that occasion was indeed\r\n\"effective,\" but such passing mention hardly covers the case. In\r\nthe first place, they selected the landing point, their patrols\r\nbeing already familiar with the coasts. As soon as the transports\r\nwere sighted, about eleven o'clock on the morning of November\r\n7th, Commander Knox, the senior officer present, who commanded the\r\nPrinceton, and Commander Moore, of the Helena, went out to meet and\r\nconfer with General Wheaton. This done, the landing was effected\r\nunder protection of the navy's guns. Besides the naval vessels\r\nabove named, there were also present the Bennington under Commander\r\nArnold, the Manila under Lieutenant-Commander Nazro, and two captured\r\nSpanish gun-boats small enough to get close in shore, the Callao,\r\nand the Samar. The troops were disembarked in two columns of small\r\nboats towed by launches. Lieutenant-Commander Tappan in charge of\r\nthe Callao, and Ensign Mustin, commanding the Samar, were especially\r\ncommended in the despatches of Admiral Watson, commander-in-chief\r\nof the Asiatic squadron. Both bombarded the insurgent trenches\r\nat close range during the landing, and Mustin actually steamed in\r\nbetween the insurgents and the head of the column of troop-boats,\r\nso as to intercept and receive the brunt of their fire himself, and,\r\nselecting a point about seventy-five yards from the enemy's trenches\r\nwhence he could effectually pepper them, ran his ship aground so she\r\nwould stick, and commenced rapid firing at point blank range, driving\r\nthe enemy from his trenches, and enabling Colonel Hare of the 33d,\r\nand those who followed, to land without being subjected to further\r\nfire while on the water. [260]\r\n\r\nOn the 11th of November, Colonel Hare with the 33d Volunteer Infantry\r\nand one Gatling gun under Captain Charles R. Howland of the 28th\r\nVolunteer Infantry, a lieutenant of the regular army, and a member of\r\nGeneral Wheaton's staff, proceeded southeastward to San Jacinto, and\r\nattacked and routed some 1200 to 1600 intrenched insurgents, Major John\r\nA. Logan being among our killed. The enemy left eighty-one dead in the\r\ntrenches, and suffered a total loss estimated at three hundred. While\r\nspace does not permit dwelling on the details of engagements, it may be\r\nremarked here, once for all, that the 33d Volunteer Infantry, Colonel\r\nLuther R. Hare commanding, made more reputation than any other of the\r\ntwenty-five regiments of the volunteer army of 1899, except, possibly,\r\nColonel J. Franklin Bell's regiment, the 36th. This is no reflection on\r\nthe rest. These two were lucky enough to have more opportunities. In\r\nmeeting his opportunities, however, Colonel Hare, like Colonel Bell,\r\nproved himself a superb soldier; his field-officers, especially Major\r\nMarch, [261] were particularly indefatigable; and his men were mostly\r\nTexans, accustomed to handling a rifle with effect. Space also forbids\r\nfollowing Captain Howland and his Gatling gun into the engagement of\r\nNovember 11th, but from the uniformity with which General Wheaton's\r\nofficial reports commend his young aide's bravery and efficiency\r\non numerous occasions in 1899-1900, it may be safely assumed that\r\nthose qualities were behind that Gatling gun at San Jacinto. There\r\nwas a vicious rumor started after the San Jacinto fight and given wide\r\ncirculation in the United States, that Major Logan was shot in the back\r\nby his own men. I saw a major surgeon a few days later who had been\r\nan eye-witness to his death. He said an insurgent sharpshooter shot\r\nMajor Logan from a tree, and that the said sharpshooter was promptly\r\nthereafter dropped from his perch full of 33d Infantry bullets. Says\r\nGeneral Wheaton's despatch of November 12th: \"Major Logan fell while\r\ngallantly leading his battalion.\" [262]\r\n\r\nOn November 5th, General MacArthur, with a strong column, composed\r\nmainly of the 9th, 17th, and 36th Regiments of Infantry, two troops of\r\nthe 4th Cavalry, two platoons of the 1st Artillery, and a detachment\r\nof scouts, advanced up the railroad from Angeles, in execution of his\r\npart of the programme. [263] Angeles is some distance up the railroad\r\nfrom Calumpit, where the railroad crosses the Rio Grande. [264]\r\nGeneral MacArthur's column encountered and overwhelmed the enemy\r\nat every point, entering Tarlac on November 12th, and effecting a\r\njunction with General Wheaton at Dagupan, the northern terminus of\r\nthe Manila-Dagupan Railroad, 120 miles from Manila, on November 20th.\r\n\r\nAfter General Lawton had finished his part of the round-up, he had\r\na final conference with General Young on November 18th at Pozorubio,\r\nwhich is near the northeastern border of the plain, bade him good-bye,\r\nand soon afterward went south to dispose of a body of insurgents who\r\nwere giving trouble near Manila. It was in this last expedition that\r\nhe lost his life at San Mateo about twelve miles out of Manila on\r\nDecember 19, 1899.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two purposes of the great Wheaton-Lawton-MacArthur\r\nnorthern advance, viz., the dispersion of the insurgent army of\r\nnorthern Luzon had been duly accomplished. The other purpose had\r\nfailed of realization. Aguinaldo had not been captured. He escaped\r\nthrough our lines.\r\n\r\nSuch is in brief the story of the destruction of the Aguinaldo\r\ngovernment in 1899 by General Otis, or rather by Mr. Root. But the\r\ntrouble about it was that it would not stay destroyed. It \"played\r\npossum\" for a while, the honorable President retiring to permanent\r\nheadquarters in the mountains \"with his government concealed about\r\nhis person,\" as Senator Lodge put it later in a summary of the case\r\nfor the Administration, before the Senate, in the spring of 1900. If\r\nthe distinguished and accomplished senator from Massachusetts, in\r\nadding at that time to the gaiety of nations, had had access to a\r\ncertain diary kept by one of Aguinaldo's personal staff throughout\r\nthat period, subsequently submitted, in 1902, to the Senate Committee\r\nof that year, he could have swelled the innocuous merriment with such\r\ncheery entries as \"Here we tightened our belts and went to bed on\r\nthe ground\"--the time alluded to being midnight after a hard day's\r\nmarch without food, the place, some chilly mountain top up which the\r\n\"Honorable Presidente\" and party had that day been guided by the\r\never-present and ever-willing paisano (fellow countryman) of the\r\nimmediate neighborhood--whatever the neighborhood--to facilitate them\r\nin eluding General Young's hard riding cavalry and scouts. The writer\r\nhas no quarrel with Senator Lodge's witticism above quoted, having\r\nderived on reading it, in full measure, the suggestive amusement it\r\nwas intended to afford. It is true that about all then left of the\r\n\"Honorable Presidente's\" government, for the nonce, was in fact\r\nconcealed about his person. It was of a nature easily portable. It\r\nneeded neither bull trains, pack ponies, nor coolies to carry it. It\r\nconsisted solely of the loyal support of the whole people, who looked\r\nto him as the incarnation of their aspirations. Said General MacArthur\r\nto the Senate Committee in 1902 concerning Aguinaldo: \"He was the\r\nincarnation of the feelings of the Filipinos.\" \"Senator Culberson:\r\n'And represented the Filipino people?' General MacArthur: 'I think so;\r\nyes'.\" [265] We of the 8th Army Corps did not know what a complete\r\nstructure the Philippine republic of 1898-9 was until, having shot\r\nit to pieces, we had abundant leisure to examine the ruins. To admit,\r\nin the same breath, participation in that war and profound regret that\r\nit ever had occurred, is not an incriminating admission. In this case\r\nas in any other where you have done another a wrong, by thrashing him\r\nor otherwise, under a mistake of fact, the first step toward righting\r\nthe wrong is to frankly acknowledge it. As soon as Aguinaldo's flight\r\nand wanderings terminated in the finding of permanent headquarters,\r\nhe began sending messages to his various generals all over Luzon and\r\nthe other islands, and wherever those orders were not intercepted they\r\nwere delivered and loyally obeyed. This kept up until General Funston\r\ncaptured him in 1901. One traitor among all those teeming millions\r\nmight have betrayed his whereabouts, but none appeared. The obstinate\r\ncharacter and long continuance of the warfare in northern Luzon after\r\nthe great round-up which terminated with the final junction of the\r\nLawton, Wheaton, and MacArthur columns near Dagupan, as elsewhere\r\nlater throughout the archipelago, was at first very surprising to our\r\ngenerals. It had been supposed that to disperse the insurgent army\r\nwould end the insurrection. As events turned out, it only made the\r\nresistance more effective. So long as the insurgents kept together\r\nin large bodies they could not hide. And as they were poor marksmen,\r\nwhile the men behind our guns, like most other young Americans,\r\nknew something about shooting, the ratio of their casualties to ours\r\nwas about 16 to 1. [266] When General MacArthur began his advance\r\non Tarlac, General Lawton his great march up the valley of the Rio\r\nGrande, and General Wheaton his closing in from Dagupan, Aguinaldo\r\nwith his cabinet, generals, and headquarters troops abandoned Tarlac,\r\ntheir capital, and went up the railroad to Bayambang. Here they held\r\na council of war, which General MacArthur describes in his report\r\nfor 1900 (from information obtained later on) as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At a council of war held at Bayambang, Pangasinan, about November\r\n    12, 1899, which was attended by General Aguinaldo and many of the\r\n    Filipino military leaders, a resolution was adopted to the effect\r\n    that the insurgent forces were incapable of further resistance\r\n    in the field, and as a consequence it was decided to disband the\r\n    army, the generals and the men to return to their own provinces,\r\n    with a view to organizing the people for general resistance by\r\n    means of guerrilla warfare. [267]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis had been the plan from the beginning, the council of war\r\nsimply determining that the time to put the plan into effect had\r\narrived. Accordingly, the uniformed insurgent battalions and regiments\r\nbroke up into small bands which maintained a most persistent guerrilla\r\nwarfare for years thereafter. During those years they seldom wore\r\nuniforms, disappearing and hiding their guns when hotly pursued,\r\nand reappearing as non-combatant peasants interrupted in agricultural\r\npursuits, with invariable protestations of friendship. Hence all such\r\ncame to be known as amigos (friends), and the word amigo, or friend,\r\nbecame a bitter by-word, meaning to all American soldiers throughout\r\nthe archipelago an enemy falsely claiming to be a friend. And every\r\nFilipino was an \"amigo.\"\r\n\r\nStill, the volunteers had arrived in time to enable Mr. Root to make\r\na very nice showing to Congress, and through it to the people, in his\r\nannual report to the President for 1899, dated November 29th. This\r\nreport is full of cheerful chirps from General Otis to the effect\r\nthat the resistance was practically ended, and the substance of the\r\ninformation it conveyed duly found its way into the President's message\r\nof December of that year and through it to the general public. One\r\nof the Otis despatches said: \"Claim to government by insurgents can\r\nbe made no longer.\" [268] This message went on to state that nothing\r\nwas now left but \"banditti,\" and that the people are all friendly\r\nto our troops. Thus misled, Mr. Root repeated to the President and\r\nthrough him to Congress and the country the following nonsense:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is gratifying to know that as our troops got away from the\r\n    immediate vicinity of Manila they found the natives of the country\r\n    exceedingly friendly * * *. This was doubtless due in some measure\r\n    to the fact that the Pampangos, who inhabit the provinces of\r\n    Pampanga and Tarlac, and the Pangasinanes, who inhabit Pangasinan,\r\n    as well as the other more northerly tribes, are unfriendly to the\r\n    Tagalogs, and had simply submitted to the military domination of\r\n    that tribe, from which they were glad to be relieved.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn characterizing this as nonsense no disrespect is intended to\r\nMr. Root. He did not know any better. He was relying on General\r\nOtis. But it is sorely difficult to convey in written words what\r\nutter nonsense those expressions about \"the Pampangos\" and \"the\r\nPangasinanes\" are to any one who was in that northern advance in the\r\nfall of 1899. Imagine a British cabinet minister making a report to\r\nParliament in 1776 couched in the following words, to wit:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Massachusetts-ites, who inhabit Massachusetts, and the\r\n    Virginia-ites who inhabit Virginia, as well as most of the other\r\n    inhabitants are unfriendly to the New York-ites, and have simply\r\n    submitted to the military domination of the last named,\r\n\r\n\r\nand you have a faint idea of the accuracy of Mr. Root's report. It is\r\nquite true that the Tagalos were the prime movers in the insurrection\r\nagainst us, as they had been in all previous insurrections against\r\nSpain. But the \"Tagalo tribe\" was no more alone among the Filipino\r\npeople in their wishes and views than the \"unterrified\" Tammany tribe\r\nwho inhabit the wilds of Manhattan Island, at the mouth of the Hudson\r\nRiver, are alone in their views among our people.\r\n\r\nOn page 70 of this report, Secretary Root reproduces a telegram from\r\nGeneral Otis dated November 18, 1899, stating that on the road from\r\nSan Nicolas to San Manuel, a day or so previous, General Lawton was\r\n\"cordially received by the inhabitants.\" He announces in the same\r\ntelegram the drowning of Captain Luna, a volunteer officer from New\r\nMexico, who was one of General Lawton's aides, and had been a captain\r\nin Colonel Roosevelt's regiment of Rough Riders before Santiago. The\r\nwriter happens to have been on that ride with General Lawton from San\r\nNicolas to San Manuel, and was within a dozen feet of Captain Luna\r\nwhen the angry current of the Agno River caught him and his pony\r\nin its grip and swept both out of sight forever, along with divers\r\ntroopers of the 4th Cavalry, horses and riders writhing to their\r\ndeath in one awful, tangled, struggling mass. He can never forget\r\nthe magnificent dash back into the wide, ugly, swollen stream made\r\nby Captain Edward L. King of General Lawton's staff, as he spurred\r\nhis horse in, followed by several troopers who had responded to his\r\ncall for mounted volunteers to accompany him in an effort to save the\r\nlives of the men who went down. Their generous work proved futile. But\r\nit was inspired partly by common dread of what they knew would happen\r\nto any half-drowned soldier who might be washed ashore far away from\r\nthe column and captured. If an army was ever \"in enemy's country\" it\r\nwas then and there. When we reached San Manuel that night, Captains\r\nKing and Sewall, the two surviving personal aides of General Lawton's\r\nstaff, and the writer, stopped, along with the general, in a little\r\nnipa shack on the roadside. General Lawton, was in an upper room busy\r\nwith couriers and the like, but downstairs King, Sewall, and myself\r\nset to work to buscar [269] something to eat. I got hold of an hombre\r\n(literally, a man; colloquially a native peasant man), who went to work\r\nwith apparent alacrity, and managed to provide three ravenously hungry\r\nyoung men with a good meal of chicken, eggs, and rice. After supper,\r\nbeing new in the country, the writer remarked to the general on the\r\nalacrity of the hombre. I had brought out from the United States the\r\nnotions there current about the nature of the resistance. General\r\nLawton said, with a humorous twinkle in those fine eyes of his:\r\n\"Humph! If you expected to be killed the next minute if you didn't\r\nfind a chicken, you'd probably find one too.\" It is true that in the\r\ncourse of the campaign General Young sent a telegram to General Otis\r\nat Manila characterizing his reception at the hands of the natives as\r\nfriendly. This was prompted by our column being met as it would come\r\ninto a town by the town band. It did not take long to see through\r\nthis, and other like hypocrisy entirely justifiable in war, though\r\nsuch tactics deceived us for a little while at first into thinking\r\nthe people were genuine amigos (friends). General Otis, not being near\r\nthe scene, remained under our original brief illusion. Let us return,\r\nhowever, from Mr. Root's \"patient and unconsenting millions dominated\r\nby the Tagalo tribe,\" of 1899, to the facts, and follow the course\r\nof events succeeding Lawton's junction with Wheaton and MacArthur\r\nand his farewell to Young.\r\n\r\nGeneral Young, with his cavalry, and the Maccabebee scouts, continued\r\nin pursuit of Aguinaldo through the passes of the mountains, the\r\nlatter having managed to run the gauntlet of our lines successfully\r\nby a very close shave. How narrowly he escaped is illustrated by\r\nthe fact that after a fight we had at the Aringay River on November\r\n19th, in which Major Batson was wounded while gallantly directing\r\nthe crossing of the river, we remained that night in the town of\r\nAringay, and at the very time we were \"hustling for chow\" in Aringay,\r\nAguinaldo was in the village of Naguilian an hour or so distant,\r\nas was authoritatively ascertained long afterward from a captured\r\ndiary of one of his staff officers. [270]\r\n\r\nGeneral Young proceeded up the coast road, in hot haste, taking\r\none town, San Fernando de Union, after a brief engagement led by\r\nthe general in person--imagine a brigadier-general leading a charge\r\nat the head of thirty-seven men!--but Aguinaldo had turned off to\r\nthe right and taken to the mountains. General Lawton wired General\r\nOtis about that time, in effect, in announcing Aguinaldo's escape\r\nthrough our lines and his own tireless brigade-commander's bold dash\r\nin pursuit of him with an inadequate force of cavalry hampered by\r\nlack of horseshoes and nails for the same, \"If Young does not catch\r\nAguinaldo, he will at least make him very unhappy.\" The Young column\r\ngarrisoned the towns along the route over which it went, occupying\r\nall the western part of Northern Luzon, hereafter described, and also\r\nlater on rescued Lieutenant Gilmore of the navy, Mr. Albert Sonnichsen,\r\npreviously an enlisted man and since a writer of some note, and other\r\nAmerican prisoners who had been in the hands of the insurgents for\r\nmany months. General Young finally made his headquarters at Vigan,\r\nin the province of Ilocos Sur, a fine town in a fine country. The\r\nIlocanos are called \"the Yankees of the Philippines,\" on account of\r\ntheir energy and industry. Vigan is on the China sea coast of Luzon\r\n(the west coast), about one hundred miles up the old Spanish coast\r\nroad, or \"King's Highway\" (Camino Real), from Lingayen Gulf (where\r\nthe hundred-and-twenty mile railroad from Manila to Dagupan ends)\r\nand about eighty miles from the extreme northern end of the island\r\nof Luzon. [271]\r\n\r\nAs subsequent policies and their effect on one's attitude toward\r\na great historic panorama do not interfere in the least with a\r\nproper appreciation of the bravery and efficiency of the army of\r\none's country, it is with much regret that this narrative cannot\r\nproperly chronicle in detail what the War Department reports record\r\nof the stirring deeds of General Young, and the officers and men\r\nof his command, Colonels Hare and Howze, Captains Chase and Dodd,\r\nand the rest, [272] performed during the long course of the work now\r\nunder consideration. One incident, however, is appropriate in this\r\nconnection, not only to a collection of genre pictures of the war\r\nitself, but also to a place among the lights and shadows of the general\r\npicture of the American occupation. On December 2, 1899, Major March\r\nof the 33d Infantry had his famous fight at Tila pass, in which young\r\nGregorio del Pilar, one of the ablest and bravest of the insurgent\r\ngenerals, was killed. The locality mentioned is a wild pass in the\r\nmountains of the west coast of Luzon, that overlook the China Sea, some\r\n4500 feet above sea level. It was strongly fortified, and was believed\r\nby the insurgents to be impregnable. The trail winds up the mountains\r\nin a sharp zigzag, and was commanded by stone barricades loop-holed\r\nfor infantry fire. The advance of our people was checked at first by\r\na heavy fire from these barricades. The approach being precipitous,\r\nit looked for a while as if the position would indeed be impregnable,\r\nand the idea of taking it by a frontal attack was abandoned. But a\r\nhill to the left front of the barricade was seized by some of our\r\nsharpshooters--those Texans of the 33d were indeed sharpshooters--and\r\nafter that, under cover of their fire, our troops managed to get in\r\na fire simultaneously both on the flank and rear of the occupants of\r\nthe barricades, climbing the precipitous slope up the mountain side\r\nby means of twigs and the like, and finally killing some fifty-two of\r\nthe enemy, General Pilar among the number. After the fight was over,\r\nLieutenant Quinlan, heretofore mentioned, moved by certain indignities\r\nin the nature of looting perpetrated upon the remains of General Pilar,\r\nburied them with such military honors as could be hastily provided,\r\nafter first taking from a pocket of the dead general's uniform a\r\nsouvenir in the shape of an unfinished poem written in Spanish by\r\nhim the night before, addressed to his sweetheart; and, the burial\r\nfinished, the American officer placed on the rude headstone left to\r\nmark the spot this generous inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n    General Gregorio Pilar, killed at the battle of Tila Pass, December\r\n    2d, 1899, commanding Aguinaldo's rear-guard. An officer and a\r\n    gentleman. (Signed) D. P. Quinlan, 2d Lieutenant, 11th Cavalry.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brief incident over, Quinlan hurried on, rejoined the column,\r\nand resumed the work of Benevolent Assimilation and the war\r\nagainst Home Rule with all the dauntless ardor of his impetuous\r\nIrish nature. Whatever the ultimate analysis of the ethics of this\r\nscene--Quinlan at the grave of Pilar--clearly the Second Lieutenant\r\nQuinlan of 1899 would hardly have agreed with the vice-presidential\r\ncandidate of 1900, Colonel Roosevelt, that granting self-government\r\nto the Filipinos would be like granting self-government to an Apache\r\nreservation under some local chief.\r\n\r\nThe territory occupied and finally \"pacified\" by General Young,\r\nwith the effective assistance of the officers heretofore mentioned,\r\nand many other good men and true, was ultimately organized into\r\na military district, which was called the First District of the\r\nDepartment of Northern Luzon. As territory was fought over, occupied,\r\nand finally reduced to submission, that territory would be organized\r\ninto a military district by the commanding general or colonel of the\r\ninvading column, under the direction of the division commander. The\r\nmilitary \"Division of the Philippines,\" which was succeeded by the\r\nCivil Government of the Philippines under Governor Taft in 1901,\r\nof course covered all the territory ceded by the Treaty of Paris. It\r\nwas divided into four \"Departments,\" the Department of Northern Luzon,\r\nthe Department of Southern Luzon, the Department of the Visayas, [273]\r\nand the Department of Mindanao and Jolo. General Young commanded the\r\nFirst District of the Department of Northern Luzon--which included\r\nthe three west coast provinces north of Lingayen Gulf, and the three\r\nadjacent mountain provinces--from the time he led his brigade into\r\nthat region in pursuit of Aguinaldo until shortly before Governor\r\nTaft's inauguration in the summer of 1901. Many were the combats,\r\ngreat and small, of General Young's brigade, in compassing the task\r\nof crushing the resistance in that part of Luzon into which he led\r\nthe first American troops in the winter of 1899-1900. The resistance\r\nwas obstinate, desperate, and long drawn out, but when he finally\r\nreported the territory under his command \"pacified,\" it was pacified.\r\nA soldier's task had been performed in a soldierly manner. The work\r\nhad been done thoroughly. General Young gave the Ilocano country a\r\nlesson it never forgot, before politics had time to interfere. We\r\nhave never had any trouble in that region from that day to this.\r\n\r\nBefore the army of occupation had had time to do in southern Luzon what\r\nGeneral Young did in northern Luzon and thereby secure like permanent\r\nresults in that region, a \"peace-at-any-price\" policy was inaugurated\r\nto meet the exigencies of Mr. McKinley's campaign for the Presidency\r\nin 1900. Our last martyred President clung all through that campaign\r\nto his original assumption that Benevolent Assimilation would work,\r\nand that the single burning need of the hour was to make clear to\r\nthe Filipinos what our intentions were--as if powder and lead did\r\nnot spell denial of independence plain enough, as if that were\r\nnot the sole issue, and as if that issue had not been submitted,\r\nwith deadly finality, to the stern arbitrament of war. However,\r\nneither Lord Roberts in India, nor Lord Kitchener in Egypt ever more\r\neffectively convinced the people of those countries that his flag\r\nmust be respected as an emblem of sovereignty, than General Young did\r\nthe Ilocanos. Take the month of April, 1900 for instance. Several\r\ndays after the expiration of said month (on May 5th) General Otis\r\nwas relieved and went home. During the month of April, General Young\r\nkilled five hundred insurgents in his district. [274] But this did\r\nnot prevent General Otis, arriving as he did in the United States\r\nin the month of June, when the national political conventions meet,\r\nfrom \"repeating the same old story about the insurrection going to\r\npieces\" [275]--only, not \"going\" now, but \"gone.\" Nor did it, and like\r\nsputterings of insurrection all over the place, prevent Judge Taft--the\r\n\"Mark Tapley of this Philippine business\" as he humorously told the\r\nSenate Committee of 1902 he had been called--from cabling home, during\r\nthe presidential campaign of 1900, a series of superlatively optimistic\r\nbulletins, [276] based on the testimony of Filipinos who had abandoned\r\nthe cause of their country as soon as patriotism meant personal peril,\r\nall such testimony being eagerly accepted, as testimony of the kind one\r\nwants and needs badly usually is, in total disregard of information\r\ndirectly to the contrary furnished by General MacArthur and other\r\ndistinguished soldiers who had been then on the ground for two years.\r\n\r\nThe area and population of the territory occupied by General Young,\r\nthe \"First District of the Department of Northern Luzon,\" was,\r\naccording to the Census of 1903, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province              Area (sq. m.) [277]      Population [278]\r\n\r\n    Ilocos Norte          1,330                       178,995\r\n    Ilocos Sur              471                       187,411\r\n    Union                   634                       137,839\r\n    Abra                  1,171                        51,860\r\n    Lepanto-Bontoc [279]  2,005                        72,750\r\n    Benguet                 822                        22,745\r\n                          -----                       -------\r\n                          6,433                       651,600\r\n\r\n\r\nAs this narrative purposes so to present the geography of the\r\nPhilippine Islands as to facilitate an easy remembrance of the\r\nessentials only of the governmental problem there presented,\r\nwe will hereafter speak of the First District as containing,\r\nroughly, 6500 square miles, and 650,000 people. Whenever, if ever,\r\na Philippine republic is set up, these six provinces are very likely,\r\nfor geographical and other reasons, to become one of the original\r\nstates comprising that republic, just as the states of Mexico are\r\nmade up of groups of provinces. [280]\r\n\r\nThe rest of the story of the northern campaign of 1899-1900 immediately\r\nfollowing Aguinaldo's escape into the mountains through General Young's\r\nand General Lawton's lines, being a necessary part of the American\r\noccupation of the Philippines, may also serve as a text for further\r\nacquainting the reader with the geography of Luzon. War is the best\r\npossible teacher of geography, and it may be well to communicate\r\nin broken doses, as we received them, the lessons on the subject\r\nwhich the 8th Army Corps learned in 1899 and the subsequent years\r\nso thoroughly that we could all pronounce with astonishing glibness,\r\nthe most unpronounceable names imaginable.\r\n\r\nWhen the great Wheaton-Lawton-MacArthur \"Round-up\" reached the\r\nmountains on the northeast of the great central plain, in the\r\nlatter part of November 1899, Captain Joseph B. Batchelor, with\r\none battalion of the 24th (negro) Infantry, and some scouts under\r\nLieutenant Castner, a very intrepid and tireless officer, boldly cut\r\nloose from the column of which he was a part, and, pressing on over the\r\nCaranglan pass, overran the province of Nueva Vizcaya, which is part\r\nof the watershed of north central Luzon, proceeding from Bayombong,\r\nthe capital of Nueva Vizcaya, down the valley of the Magat River,\r\nby the same route Messrs. Wilcox and Sargent of the navy had made\r\ntheir pleasant junket in the fall of 1898 as described in Chapter VI\r\n(ante). Following this route Captain Batchelor finally came into\r\nIsabela province, where the Magat empties into the Cagayan River,\r\nreaching Iligan, the capital of Isabela, ninety miles northeast of\r\nBayombong, about December 8th. From Iligan Batchelor went on, promptly\r\novercoming all resistance offered, down the great Cagayan valley, some\r\n110 miles due north, to the sea at Aparri, the northernmost town of\r\nLuzon and of the archipelago, where he met two vessels of our navy,\r\nthe Newark and the Helena, under Captain McCalla, and found, to his\r\ninexpressible (but partially and rather fervently expressed) chagrin,\r\nthat the insurgents who had fled before him, and also the garrison\r\nat Aparri, had already surrendered to the navy. The territory thus\r\ncovered by Batchelor's bold, brilliant, and memorable march over two\r\nhundred miles of hostile country from the mountains of central Luzon\r\ndown the Cagayan valley to the northern end of the island, at Aparri,\r\n[281] consisted of the three provinces of Cagayan, Isabela, and Nueva\r\nVizcaya. The area and population of these three, according to the\r\ncensus tables of 1903, are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province             Area (sq. m.) [282]   Population [283]\r\n\r\n    Cagayan               5,052                156,239\r\n    Isabela               5,018                 76,431\r\n    Nueva Vizcaya         1,950                 62,541\r\n                         ------                -------\r\n    Total                12,020                295,211\r\n\r\n\r\nThe troops of Captain Batchelor's command were later on relieved by\r\nthe 16th Infantry, commanded by Colonel Hood, under whom the above\r\ngroup of three provinces finally became the \"Second District of the\r\nDepartment of Northern Luzon.\" As part of the plan to provide the\r\nreader with a fair general idea of Luzon conveniently portable in\r\nmemory, he is requested to note, at this point, that hereinafter the\r\nCagayan valley, with its three provinces, [284] will be alluded to as\r\na district containing 12,000 square miles and 300,000 people. As was\r\nremarked concerning the original military district commanded by General\r\nYoung, to wit, the First District, so of Colonel Hood's district,\r\nthe Second--that is to say, as the Ilocano country may some day become\r\nthe state of Ilocos, so, for like geographical and other governmental\r\nreasons, the three provinces of the Cagayan valley may some day become\r\nthe state of Cagayan in the possible Philippine republic of the future.\r\n\r\nHaving now followed the \"far-flung battle line\" of the volunteers of\r\n'99 and their comrades in arms, the regulars, from Manila northward\r\nacross the rice paddies of central Luzon and over the mountains to the\r\nnorthern extremity of the island, let us return to the central plain,\r\nfor reasons which will be stated in so doing. Between the China Sea\r\nand the coast range which forms the western boundary of the central\r\nplain of Luzon, there is a long strip of territory--a west wing of\r\nthe plain, as it were--about 125 miles long, with an average width\r\nof not more than twenty miles, stretching from Manila Bay to Lingayen\r\nGulf. This is divided, for governmental purposes into two provinces,\r\nBataan on the south, whose southern extremity lay on Admiral Dewey's\r\nport side as he entered Manila Bay the night before the naval battle\r\nof May 1, 1898, and Zambales on the north. The area and population\r\nof this territory are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province             Area (sq. m.)

Principe and Infanta are wholly\r\nunimportant, except that, to avoid confusion, we must account for\r\nall the provinces visible on the maps of Luzon. These two provinces\r\nnever gave any trouble and no one ever bothered about them. [285]\r\nIn the mountains of Zambales and Bataan, however, as in most of the\r\nother provinces of the archipelago, the struggle was long kept up,\r\njust as the Boers kept up their war for independence against Great\r\nBritain about the same time, by guerrilla warfare.\r\n\r\nThe central plain with five provinces has already been fully\r\ndescribed. If to this plain you add its two wings, above mentioned,\r\nyou have the nine provinces of central Luzon you see on the map. And\r\nif to them you add the six provinces of the Ilocos country and the\r\nthree of the Cagayan valley, you have clearly before you the political\r\nmake-up of northern Luzon--eighteen provinces in all. When central\r\nLuzon was arranged by districts under the military occupation,\r\nit was divided into three parts, the Third, Fourth, and Fifth\r\ndistricts of the Department of Northern Luzon, the Third District\r\nbeing under General Jacob H. Smith of Samar fame, [286] the Fourth\r\nunder General Funston, and the Fifth under General Grant. The Sixth\r\nand last district of northern Luzon was made up of the city of Manila\r\nand adjacent territory.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith's district, the Third, comprised the provinces of\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province           Area (sq. m.)

[288] This Third District may be conveniently\r\nrecollected as accounting for, roughly speaking, 4500 square miles\r\nof territory and 625,000 people. The total combined area of General\r\nFunston's old district, the Fourth, [289] and the adjacent one,\r\nthe Fifth, General Grant's district, is--roughly--5000 square miles,\r\nand its total population 650,000. No reason is apparent why these two\r\ndistricts, the Fourth and Fifth, should not ultimately evolve into a\r\nState of Pampanga. The five original military districts, [290] which\r\nin 1900 constituted all of the Department of Northern Luzon except\r\nthe city of Manila and vicinity, might make four ultimate states,\r\nwith names, areas, and populations as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    State            Area (sq. m.)         Population\r\n\r\n    Ilocos            6,500                   650,000\r\n    Cagayan          12,000                   300,000\r\n    Pangasinan        4,500                   625,000\r\n    Pampanga          5,000                   650,000\r\n                     ------                 ---------\r\n                     28,000                 2,225,000\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may surprise the reader after all the blood and thunder to which\r\nhis attention has hereinabove been subjected, apropos of northern\r\nLuzon and the winter of 1899-1900, to know that the insurgents were\r\nstill bearding the lion in his den, i. e., General Otis in Manila,\r\nby operating in very considerable force in the village-dotted country\r\nwithin cannon-shot of the road from Manila to Cavite in January,\r\n1900. Nevertheless such was the case.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th of January, 1900, General J. C. Bates was assigned to\r\nthe command of the First Division of the Eighth Army Corps, General\r\nLawton's old division, and an active campaign was commenced in southern\r\nLuzon. The plan adopted was that General Wheaton with a strong force\r\nshould engage and hold the enemy in the neighborhood of Cavite, while\r\nGeneral Schwan, starting at the western horn of the half moon to which\r\nthe great lake called Laguna de Bay has already been likened, should\r\nmove rapidly down the west shore of the lake, and around its south\r\nshore to Santa Cruz near its eastern end, or horn, garrisoning the\r\ntowns en route, as taken, instead of leaving them to be re-occupied by\r\nthe insurgents. Santa Cruz is the same place where General Lawton had\r\n\"touched second base,\" as it were, with a flying column in April, 1899.\r\n\r\nThis plan was duly carried out. The Schwan column started from San\r\nPedro Macati, the initial rendezvous, a few miles out of Manila,\r\non January 4, 1900, now garrisoning the towns en route, instead of\r\nleaving them to be fought over and captured again as heretofore. The\r\nfirst stiff fight we had in that campaign was at Binan, on January 6,\r\n1900, one of the places General Lawton's expedition had taken when\r\nhe fought his way over the same country the year before. O. K. Davis\r\nand John T. McCutcheon, who were in that fight and campaign--in fact\r\none of them had the ice-cold nerve to photograph the Binan fight while\r\nit was going on, as I learned when we all went down to the creek near\r\nthe town, after we took it, to freshen up--can testify that we did not\r\nthen hear any nonsense about a \"Tagal\" insurrection, such as Secretary\r\nof War Root's Report for 1899, published shortly before, is full of,\r\nand that on the contrary the whole country was as much a unit against\r\nus and as loyal to the Aguinaldo government as northern Luzon had\r\nbeen. And inasmuch as I am doing some \"testifying\" along here myself,\r\nand assuming to brush aside without the slightest hesitation, as wholly\r\nerroneous, information conveyed to the American public at the time\r\nin the state papers of President McKinley and Secretary of War Root,\r\nit is only due the reader, whose attention is being seriously asked,\r\nthat \"the witness\" should \"qualify\" as to the opportunities he may\r\nhave had, if any, to know whereof he speaks, concerning the character\r\nof the opposition. To that end, the following document, which General\r\nSchwan was kind enough to send me afterwards, is submitted as sent:\r\n\r\n\r\n    EXTRACT COPY.\r\n\r\n    Headquarters Detachment Macabebe Scouts.\r\n    The Adjutant General, Schwan's Expeditionary Brigade:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report of the\r\n    operations of the Detachment of Macabebe Scouts, under my command,\r\n    while forming a part of your Brigade.\r\n\r\n    The Detachment, consisting of five (5) officers and one hundred\r\n    and forty (140) men, was divided into two companies, commanded\r\n    by 1st Lt. J. Lee Hall, 33rd Inf., and 1st Lt. Blount, 29th Inf.,\r\n    left San Pedro Macati the afternoon of Jan. 4th, 1900 * * *.\r\n\r\n                * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\n    I wish to invite your attention, especially, to the good work\r\n    done in the fight at Binan by Lieut.

Geiger, 1st Lt. 14th Inf., Com'd'g Det.\r\n\r\n\r\n    I hereby certify that the above is a true copy of extracts from\r\n    the report of the operations of the Detachment of Macabebe Scouts\r\n    forming part of an Expeditionary Brigade under my command, in\r\n    the months of January and February, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Theo. Schwan,\r\n        Brig. General, U. S. Vols.\r\n        Aug. 16, 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe activities of Generals Bates and Wheaton, and the Schwan Expedition\r\nof January-February, 1900, extended the American occupation, so far\r\nas there were troops enough immediately available to go around, over\r\nthe lake-shore portions and the principal towns of the two great\r\nprovinces of southern Luzon bordering on the Laguna de Bay, viz.,\r\nCavite and Laguna; and over parts of the two adjacent provinces of\r\nBatangas and Tayabas.\r\n\r\nBatangas bounds Cavite on the south, and is itself bounded on the\r\nsouth by the sea, where a fairly good port offered a fine gateway\r\nfor smuggling arms into the interior from abroad. Tayabas province\r\nadjoins Laguna on the southeast. Cavite province has always been,\r\nsince the opening of the Suez Canal, about 1869, and the agitations\r\nfor political reform in Spain which culminated in the Spanish republic\r\nof 1873, quickened the thought of Spain's East Indies, the home of\r\ninsurrection, the breeding place of political agitation. Aguinaldo\r\nhimself was born within its limits in 1869. Laguna province comprehends\r\nmost of the country lying between the southern and eastern lake-shore\r\nof the Laguna de Bay and the mountains which skirt that body of water\r\nin the blue distance, all parts of it being thus in easy and safe\r\ntouch by water transportation by night with Cavite, the home and\r\nheadquarters of insurgency.\r\n\r\nJust as northern Luzon had been gradually organized into military\r\ndistricts as conquered, so was southern Luzon. The territory, over-run,\r\nas above described, by Generals Bates, Wheaton, and Schwan, was divided\r\ninto two districts. [291] Colonel Hare commanded the First District,\r\nCavite province and vicinity. General Hall commanded the Second\r\nDistrict, Batangas, Laguna, and Tayabas. The area and population of\r\nthese four provinces, according to the Census of 1903, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province            Area (sq. m.)             Population\r\n\r\n    Cavite                619                      134,779\r\n    Batangas            1,201                      257,715\r\n    Laguna                629                      148,606\r\n    Tayabas             5,993                      153,065\r\n                        -----                      -------\r\n                        8,442                      694,165\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience of subsequent allusion, this group of provinces may\r\nbe treated as representing roughly 8500 square miles of territory\r\nand 700,000 people. These four provinces group themselves together\r\nnaturally from a military standpoint. As physical force is the\r\nfinal basis of all government, these four provinces constitute a\r\nlogical administrative governmental unit, as shown by the action\r\nof our military authorities in their extension of the American\r\noccupation. It would seem therefore that if there should ever be\r\na Philippine republic, they would probably constitute one of its\r\nstates--the State, let us say, of Cavite.\r\n\r\nThe rest of southern Luzon below that part above described consists of\r\na peninsula which, owing to its odd formation, is easy to remember. The\r\nmainland of Luzon, that is to-say, that part of the island which our\r\nnarrative has already covered, remotely suggests, in shape, the State\r\nof Illinois. At least it resembles Illinois more than it does any other\r\nState of our Union, in that its length runs north and south, and its\r\naverage length and width are nearer that of Illinois than any other. At\r\nthe southeast corner of this mainland, the observer of the map will\r\nsee, jutting off to the southeast from the mainland, the peninsula in\r\nquestion. It is about a hundred and fifty miles long, with an average\r\nwidth of possibly thirty miles--a minimum width of, say, ten miles, and\r\na maximum of fifty,--and is separated from Samar by the narrow, swift,\r\nand treacherous San Bernardino Strait, which connects the Pacific\r\nOcean with the China Sea. This peninsula is frequently called \"the\r\nHemp Peninsula.\" The importance of controlling the hemp ports prompted\r\nGeneral Otis to send General Bates with an expedition to those ports on\r\nFebruary 15, 1900. [292] This expedition did little more than occupy\r\nthose ports. The great interior continued under insurgent control\r\nsome time afterward. The report of the Secretary of War, Mr. Root,\r\nfor 1900, goes on to describe an engagement, or two, sustained by\r\nthe Bates Expedition shortly after it landed, and concludes, with\r\na complacency almost Otis-like, by stating that shortly thereafter\r\n\"the normal conditions of industry and trade relations with Manila\r\nwere resumed by the inhabitants.\" Of course Mr. Root believed this,\r\nand so did Mr. McKinley. More the pity, as we shall later see. General\r\nOtis was now getting anxious to go home, and hastened to \"occupy\"\r\nand organize the rest of the archipelago, on paper, at least, the\r\nhemp peninsula becoming, on March 20, 1900, the Third District of\r\nthe Department of Southern Luzon, Brigadier-General James M. Bell\r\ncommanding. The provinces comprised in this district, with their\r\nareas and populations as given by the Census of 1903, were as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province              Area (sq. m.)         Population\r\n\r\n    Camarines [293]       3,279                  239,405\r\n    Albay                 1,783                  240,326\r\n    Sorsogon                755                  120,495\r\n                          -----                  -------\r\n                          5,817                  600,226\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience of subsequent allusion, these three provinces of\r\nthe hemp peninsula which constituted the Third Military District of\r\nthe Military Department of Southern Luzon in 1900, may be regarded\r\nas comprising, roughly, 6000 square miles of territory and 600,000\r\npeople. If the Philippine republic of the future which is the dream\r\nof the Filipino people, prove other than an idle dream, the hemp\r\npeninsula will probably some day constitute a state of that republic,\r\nan appropriate and probable name for which would be the State of\r\nCamarines.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth District of southern Luzon--there were but four--was\r\noccupied by the 29th U. S. Volunteer Infantry, commanded by Colonel\r\nE. E. Hardin, one of the best executive officers General Otis had in\r\nhis whole command. The Fourth District comprised a lot of islands\r\nunnecessary to be considered at length in this bird's-eye view of\r\nthe panorama, but necessary to be mentioned in outlining the military\r\noccupation. The 29th, like the other twenty-four volunteer regiments,\r\nsettled down with equanimity to the business of policing a hostile\r\ncountry, sang with zest, like the rest of the twenty-five volunteer\r\nregiments, that old familiar song, \"Damn, Damn, Damn the Filipino,\"\r\netc., and waited with the uniquely admirable stoicism of the American\r\nsoldier for the season of their home-going to roll round, which, under\r\nthe Act of Congress, [294] would be the spring of the following year.\r\n\r\nIn volume i., part 5, War Department Report, 1899, at pages 5 et seq.,\r\nmay be found a journal illustrating the nature of the \"police\" work\r\ndone by the volunteers of 1899, in 1900, and at pages 5 et seq. of\r\nthe same report for 1900 (volume i., part 4) may be found a similar\r\ndiary carried up to June 30, 1901. Throughout the period covered by\r\nthose reports, scarcely a day passed without what the military folk\r\ncoolly call \"contacts\" with the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Visayan Islands were in course of time duly organized, as Luzon had\r\npreviously been, departmentally and by military districts. The Visayan\r\nIslands became the Department of Visayas, divided into districts\r\ncommanded either by regimental commanders having a regiment or more\r\nwith them, or by general officers. For a long time no attempt to make\r\nmilitary occupation effective in these various islands, save in the\r\ncoast towns, was attempted. However, the indicated disposition of\r\ntroops completed, technically at least, the American occupation of\r\nthe Visayan Islands.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the plan followed, as we have hitherto followed the\r\narmy in our narrative, first throughout northern Luzon and later\r\nthrough southern Luzon, some data are now in order concerning the\r\nVisayan Islands.\r\n\r\nAs already made clear, there are but six of the Visayan Islands with\r\nwhich any one interested in the Philippines merely as a student of\r\nworld politics or of history need bother. The area and population of\r\nthese are as follows: [295]\r\n\r\n\r\n    Island                Area (sq. m.)       Population\r\n\r\n    Panay                 4,611                743,646\r\n    Negros                4,881                460,776\r\n    Cebu                  1,762                592,247\r\n    Leyte                 2,722                356,641\r\n    Samar                 5,031                222,090\r\n    Bohol                 1,441                243,148\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever, if ever, an independent republic is established in\r\nthe Philippines, the six islands above mentioned could and should\r\nconstitute self-governing commonwealths similar to the several States\r\nof the American Union. The rest of the islands lying between Luzon\r\nand Mindanao could easily be disposed of governmentally by being\r\nattached to the jurisdiction of one of the said six islands.\r\n\r\nMindanao and the adjacent islets called Jolo were organized as\r\nthe Department of Mindanao and Jolo, under General Kobbe, with\r\nthe 31st Volunteer Infantry, Colonel Pettit's regiment, the 40th\r\nVolunteer Infantry, Colonel Godwin's regiment, and the 23rd Regular\r\nInfantry. Thus the archipelago was completely accounted for, for\r\nthe time being, just as all the territory of the United States was\r\nlong accounted for by our military authorities at home, with the\r\nDepartment of the East, headquarters Governor's Island, New York; the\r\nDepartment of the Lakes, headquarters Chicago; the Department of the\r\nGulf, headquarters Atlanta, etc. In this state of the case, General\r\nOtis re-embraced his early pet delusion--if it was a delusion, which\r\ncharity and the probabilities suggest it should be called--about the\r\ninsurrection having gone to pieces; and decided to come home. Possibly,\r\nalso, he was homesick. General Otis was a very positive character,\r\na strong man. But even strong men get homesick after long exile. When\r\nyou hear the call of the homeland after long residence \"east of Suez,\"\r\nyou must answer the call, duty not forbidding. General Otis had stood\r\nby his ink wells and the Administration with unswerving devotion\r\nfor twenty months, and was entitled to come back home and tell the\r\npublic all about the fighting in the Philippines, and how entirely\r\nover it was, and how wholly right Mr. McKinley was in his theory\r\nthat the visible opposition to our rule and the seeming desire to\r\nbe free and independent did not represent the wishes of the Filipino\r\npeople at all, but only the \"sinister ambitions of a few unscrupulous\r\nTagalo leaders.\" Accordingly on May 5, 1900, he was relieved at his\r\nown request, and departed for the United States. He was succeeded\r\nin command by a very different type of man, Major-General Arthur\r\nMacArthur, upon whom now devolved the problem of holding down the\r\nsituation and of actually getting it stably \"well in hand\" by June\r\n30, 1901, the date of expiration of the term of enlistment of the\r\ntwenty-five volunteer regiments organized under the Act of March\r\n2, 1899.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMACARTHUR AND THE WAR\r\n\r\n                        Damn, damn, damn the Filipino,\r\n                        Pock-marked khakiac ladrone; [296]\r\n                        Underneath the starry flag\r\n                        Civilize him with a Krag,\r\n                        And return us to our own beloved home.\r\n\r\n                     Army Song of the Philippines under MacArthur. [297]\r\n\r\n\r\nSome one has said, \"Let me write the songs of a people and I care\r\nnot who makes their laws.\" Give me the campaign songs of a war, and\r\nI will so write the history of that war that he who runs may read,\r\nand, reading, know the truth. The volunteers of 1899 had, most of\r\nthem, been in the Spanish War of '98. That struggle had been so\r\nbrief that, to borrow a phrase of the principal beneficiary of it,\r\nColonel Roosevelt, there had not been \"war enough to go 'round.\" The\r\nPhilippine insurrection had already broken out when the Spanish War\r\nvolunteers returned from Cuba in the first half of 1899. Few of them\r\nknew exactly where the Philippines were on the map. They simply knew\r\nthat we had bought the islands, that disturbances of public order\r\nwere in progress there, and that the Government desired to suppress\r\nthem. The President had called for volunteers. That was enough. When\r\nthey reached the islands, instead of finding a lot of outlaws,\r\nbrigands, etc., such as that pestiferous, ill-conditioned outfit of\r\nhorse-thieves and cane-field burning patriots we volunteers of '98\r\nhad to comb out of the eastern end of Cuba under General Wood in the\r\nwinter of 1898-9, they found Manila, on their arrival, practically\r\nalmost a besieged city. They knew that the erroneous impression\r\nthey had brought with them was the result of misrepresentation. Who\r\nwas responsible for that misrepresentation they did not attempt to\r\nanalyze. They simply set to work with American energy to put down the\r\ninsurrection. Nobody questioned the unanimity of the opposition. There\r\nit was, a fact--denied at home, but a fact. In the course of the fight\r\nagainst the organized insurgent army they lost a great many of their\r\ncomrades, and in that way the unanimity of the resistance was quite\r\nforcibly impressed upon them. By kindred psychologic processes equally\r\nfree from mystery, their determination to overcome the resistance\r\nearly became very set--a state of mind which boded no good to the\r\nFilipinos. The army song given at the beginning of Chapter XI (ante),\r\nin which General Otis is made to sing, after the fashion of some of\r\nthe characters in Pinafore, that pensive query to himself\r\n\r\n\r\n    Am I the boss, or am I a tool?\r\n\r\n\r\nthe first stanza of which closes\r\n\r\n\r\n    Now I'd like to know who's the boss of the show,\r\n    Is it me or Emilio Aguinaldo?\r\n\r\n\r\nwas a point of departure, in the matter of information, which\r\nserved to acquaint them with all that had gone before. They resented\r\nthe loss of prestige to American arms and desired to restore that\r\nprestige. While engaged in so doing, they became aware, during the\r\nPresidential year 1900, that the campaign of that year in the United\r\nStates was based largely upon the pretence that the majority of the\r\nFilipinos welcomed our rule. Naturally, their experience led them to\r\na very general and very cordial detestation of this pretence. For one\r\nthing, it was an unfair belittling of the actual military service\r\nthey were rendering. People hate a lie whether they are able to\r\ntrace its devious windings to its source or sources, or to analyze\r\nall its causes, or calculate all its possible effects, or not. The\r\nreal rock-bottom falsehood, not as fully understood then as it became\r\nlater, consisted in the impression sought to be produced at home, in\r\norder to get votes, that the great body of the Filipino people were\r\nnot really in sympathy with their country's struggle for freedom,\r\nand would be really glad tamely to accept the alien domination so\r\nbenevolently offered by a superior people, but were being coerced into\r\nfighting through intimidation by a few selfish leaders acting for their\r\nown selfish ends. While our fighting generals in the field,--General\r\nMacArthur, for instance, whose interview with a newspaper man just\r\nafter the fall of Malolos, in March, 1899, subsequently verified by\r\nhim before the Senate Committee of 1902, has already been noticed--at\r\nfirst believed that it was only a faction that we had to contend with,\r\nthey soon discovered that the whole people were loyal to Aguinaldo and\r\nthe cause he represented. But, while the point as to how unanimous\r\nthe resistance was remained a disputed matter for some little time\r\namong those of our people who did not have to \"go up against it,\"\r\nthe most curious fact of that whole historic situation, to my mind,\r\nis the absolute identity of the disputed suggestion with that which\r\nhad previously been used in like cases in all ages by the powerful\r\nagainst people struggling to be free, and the cotemporaneous absence\r\nof any notation of the coincidence by any conspicuous spectator of\r\nthe drama, to say nothing of us smaller fry who bore the brunt of\r\nthe war or any portion of it.\r\n\r\nThose men of '99 in the Philippines realized in 1900, vaguely\r\nit may be, but actually, that they were waging a war of conquest\r\nafter the manner of the British as sung by Kipling, but under the\r\nhypocritical pretence that they were doing missionary work to improve\r\nthe Filipino. They did not know whether the Filipinos could or could\r\nnot run a decent government if permitted. It was too early to form\r\nany judgment. And even then there was no unanimous feeling that they\r\ncould not. Brigadier-General Charles King, the famous novelist,\r\nwho was in the fighting out there during the first half of 1899,\r\nwas quoted in the Catholic Citizen, of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in June,\r\n1899, as having said in an interview given at Milwaukee:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is no reason in the world why the people should not have\r\n    the self-government which they so passionately desire, so far as\r\n    their ability to carry it on goes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe real reason why the war was being waged was stated with the honesty\r\nwhich heated public discussion always brings forth, by Hon. Charles\r\nDenby, a member of the Schurman Commission of 1899, in an article\r\nwhich appeared in the Forum for February, 1899, entitled \"Why the\r\nTreaty Should be Ratified:\" [298]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cold, hard, practical question alone remains: \"Will the\r\n    possession of the islands benefit us as a nation?\" If it will not,\r\n    set them free to-morrow.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut in the same magazine, the Forum, for June, 1900, in other words\r\nto the very same audience, in an article whose title is a protest,\r\n\"Do we Owe the Filipinos Independence?\" we find this same distinguished\r\ndiplomat sagaciously deferring to that not inconsiderable element of\r\nthe American public which is opposed to wars for conquest, with the\r\nrank hypocrisy which must ever characterize a republic warring for\r\ngain against the ideals that made it great, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A little time ought to be conceded to the Administration to\r\n    ascertain what the wish of the people [meaning the people of the\r\n    Philippine Islands] really is; [299]\r\n\r\n\r\nadding some of the stale but ever-welcome salve originally invented\r\nby General Otis for use by Mr. McKinley on the public conscience\r\nof America, about the war having been \"fomented by professional\r\npoliticians,\" and not having the moral support of the whole people. \"A\r\nmajority of the Filipinos are friendly to us,\" he says. Even as early\r\nas January 4, 1900, in the New York Independent, we find Mr. Denby\r\nabandoning all his previous honesty of 1899 about \"the cold, hard,\r\npractical question,\" and rubbing his hands with invisible soap to\r\nthe tune of the following hypocrisy:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Let us find out how many of the people want independence, and\r\n    how many are willing to remain loyal to our government. It is\r\n    believed a large majority [etc.]. [300]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same article even assumed an air of injured innocence and urged\r\nthat as soon as the insurgent army laid down its arms [301] \"the\r\nintentions of our government will be made known by Congress.\" That\r\nwas just thirteen years ago, and \"the intentions of our government\"\r\nhave never yet been \"made known by Congress,\" despite the fact\r\nthat the omission has all these years been like a buzzing insect,\r\nlighting intermittently on the sores of race prejudice and political\r\ndifference in the Philippines, to say nothing of the circumstance\r\nthat such omission leaves everybody guessing, including ourselves. The\r\nomission has been due to the fact that both the McKinley Administration\r\nwhich committed the original blunder of taking the islands, and\r\nthe succeeding Administrations which have been the legatees of that\r\nblunder, have always needed in their Philippine business the support\r\nboth of those whose votes are caught by the Denby honesty of 1899\r\nand those whose votes are caught by the Denby hypocrisy of 1900.\r\n\r\nWar is a great silencer of hypocrisy. In the presence of real sorrow\r\nand genuine anger, it slinks away and is seen no more until more\r\npiping times. The lists of casualties had been duly bulletined to\r\nthe United States from time to time between February, 1899, and June,\r\n1900, so that by the date last named it had become \"good politics\" to\r\nthrow off the mask. Hence, at the Republican National Convention held\r\nin Philadelphia June 19-21, 1900, we find that astute past-master of\r\nthe science of government by parties, Senator Lodge, boldly throwing\r\noff the mask thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We make no hypocritical pretense of being interested in the\r\n    Philippines solely on account of others. We believe in trade\r\n    expansion.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the words of a United States Senator are much listened to by an\r\narmy in the field. When a war breaks out, it is usually your Senator\r\nwho gets your commission for you originally, and has you promoted\r\nand made captain, colonel, or general, as the case may be, if you do\r\nanything to deserve it, or lifted from the ranks to a commission, if\r\nyou do anything to deserve it, or sees that something fitting is done\r\nif you die in any specially decent way. An army in the field thinks\r\na United States Senator is about one of the biggest institutions\r\ngoing--which, seriously, is not far from the truth, with all due\r\nrespect to the blase pessimists of the press gallery. Consider then how\r\nwholly uninspiring, as a sentiment to die by and kill by, the above\r\nsenatorial utterance was to the men in the field in the Philippines,\r\nwho did not even then believe the islands would pay. The \"cold, hard,\r\npractical\" fact was, if the Senator was to be believed, that we were\r\nfighting for what is generically called \"Wall Street;\" that it was\r\nprimarily a Wall Street war: an expedition fitted out to kill enough\r\nFilipinos to make the survivors good future customers--\"Ultimate\r\nConsumers\"--and only incidentally a war to make people follow your\r\nway of being happy in lieu of their own. Yet we had most of us, but\r\nshortly previously to that, gone trooping headlong to Cuba, in the wake\r\nof the most inspiring single personality of this age--Senator Lodge's\r\nfriend, Colonel Roosevelt--some of our American thoraxes inflated with\r\nsentiments thus nobly expressed by the same distinguished Senator in\r\nhis speech on the resolution which declared war against Spain:\r\n\r\n\"We are there\" (meaning in the then Cuban situation), Senator Lodge\r\nhad said in the Senate, in the matchless outburst of eloquence with\r\nwhich he set the keynote to the war with Spain--\r\n\r\n\r\n    We are there because we represent the spirit of liberty and the\r\n    new time. * * * We have grasped no man's territory, we have taken\r\n    no man's property, we have invaded no man's rights. We do not\r\n    ask their lands. [302]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat difference, however, did it make to men under military orders,\r\nand that far away from home, where American public opinion could not\r\nand never can affect any given situation in time to help it, whether\r\nthey were serving God or the devil? Everything disappeared but the\r\nprimal fighting instinct. So the slaughter proceeded right merrily,\r\nat a ratio of about sixteen to one, and many a Filipino died with the\r\nword \"Independence\" on his lips, [303] while many an obscure American\r\nlife went out, fighting under the Denby-Lodge dollar-mark flag of\r\npseudo-trade expansion. Can you imagine a more thankless job? Do\r\nyou wonder at the song that heads the chapter? Still, war is war,\r\nonce you are in it. All through 1900 the volunteers of 1899 kept on,\r\ncheerfully doing their country's work, not in the least hampered by\r\nwhys or wherefores, so far as the quality of their work went. They knew\r\nthat the Filipinos were not heathen, and they were not perfectly clear\r\nthat they themselves were doing the Lord's work, unless \"putting the\r\nfear of God into the heart of the insurrecto\"--one of their campaign\r\nexpressions--was the Lord's work. However, if any of them gave any\r\nspecial thought to the ethics of the situation, this did not in the\r\nleast affect their efficiency in action, nor their determination to\r\nlick the Filipino into submission. When the brief organized resistance\r\nof the insurgent armies in the field (February to November, 1899)\r\nunderwent its transition to the far more formidable guerrilla tactics,\r\nthey realized that they were \"up against\" a long and tedious task,\r\nin which would be no special glamour, as there had been in Cuba,\r\nbecause the war was not much more popular at home than it was with\r\nthem. The rank net hypocrisy of the whole situation, as they viewed\r\nit, is expressed in the song which heads this chapter. It is an\r\nanswer to the Taft nonsense of 1900 about \"the people long for peace\r\nand are willing to accept government under United States.\" [304]\r\nThat is why the Caribao Society do not sing it to Mr. Taft when he\r\nattends their annual banquet, notwithstanding that it is the star\r\nsong of their repertoire. [305] This statement of Judge Taft's, as\r\nwell as other like statements of his which followed it during the\r\npresidential campaign of 1900, would have been perfectly harmless in\r\nhome politics. It was made in the same spirit of optimism in which\r\na Taft man will tell you to-day, \"The people are willing to see the\r\nTaft Administration endorsed.\" But at that time in the Philippines\r\nthere was no possible way to prove or disprove the statement to the\r\nsatisfaction of anybody at home--or elsewhere, for that matter. And,\r\nunder the circumstances, it was at once a libel on Filipino patriotism\r\nand an ungracious belittling of the work of the American army. It was\r\na libel on Filipino patriotism because it denied the loyal (even if\r\nill-advised) unanimity of the Filipino people in their struggle for\r\nindependence, and was a statement made recklessly, without knowledge,\r\nin aid of a presidential candidate in the United States. That it was\r\nhighly inaccurate was well known to some 70,000 American soldiers then\r\nin the field, who were daily getting insurrecto lead pumped into them,\r\nand also well known to their gallant commander, General MacArthur, who\r\ntold Judge Taft just that thing. That it was an ungracious belittling\r\nof the work of the army is certainly obvious enough, and it was\r\nso considered by the army, and its commanding general aforesaid,\r\nwho practically told Judge Taft just that thing. But Mr. Root,\r\nthen Secretary of War, was as much interested in Mr. McKinley's\r\nre-election as Judge Taft was. So he spread the Taft cablegrams\r\nbroadcast throughout the United States during the presidential\r\ncampaign, and pigeonholed the MacArthur messages and reports on the\r\nsituation in the dusty and innocuous desuetude of the War Department\r\narchives. Four years later at the Republican National Convention of\r\n1904, Mr. Root told the naked truth, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the last national convention met, over 70,000 soldiers from\r\n    more than 500 stations held a still vigorous enemy in check. [306]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is all a record made and unalterable. It is a fair sample\r\nof the initial stages of one more of the experiments in colonization\r\nby a republic which are scattered through history and teach but\r\none lesson. All the gentlemen concerned were personally men of high\r\ntype. But look at the net result of their work. The impression it\r\nproduced in the United States, at a tremendously critical period in the\r\ncountry's history, when the men at the helm of state were bending every\r\nenergy to railroad the republic into a career of overseas conquest,\r\nand using the army for that purpose, can be called by a short and ugly\r\nword. The splendor of Mr. Root's intellect is positively alluring,\r\nbut he is a dangerous man to republican institutions. Mr. Taft's part\r\nin that conspiracy for the suppression of the facts of the Philippine\r\nsituation in 1900 was really due to kindliness of heart, regret\r\nat the war, and earnest hope that it would soon end. Mr. Denby's\r\npart was that of the out-and-out imperialist who has frank doubts\r\nin his own mind as to whether it is axiomatic, after all, that the\r\nform of government bequeathed us by our fathers is the best form of\r\ngovernment yet devised. But the conspiracy was really a sin against\r\nthe progress of the world, because it deceived the American people as\r\nto the genuineness and unanimity of the desire of the Filipino people\r\nto imitate the example set by us in 1776, which has since served as\r\na beacon-light of hope to so many people in so many lands in their\r\nseveral struggles to be free.\r\n\r\nBy the spring of 1900, when General MacArthur relieved General Otis,\r\nthe volunteers of 1899 had gotten thoroughly warmed up to the work\r\nof showing the Filipinos who was in fact \"the boss of the show,\"\r\nand by June, 1900, when Judge Taft arrived, they had gotten still\r\nwarmer [307]; and in General Otis's successor they had a commander\r\nwho understood his men thoroughly, and was determined to carry out\r\nhonestly, with firmness, and without playing, as his predecessor had\r\ndone, the role of political henchman, the purpose for which the army\r\nhe commanded had been sent to the Islands to accomplish. In this\r\nstate of the case, the Taft Commission came out.\r\n\r\nThis would seem rather an odd point at which to terminate a chapter on\r\n\"MacArthur and the War,\" seeing that General MacArthur continued to\r\ncommand the American forces in the Philippines and to direct their\r\nstrenuous field operations until July, 1901, more than a year later,\r\nwhen he was relieved by General Chaffee, on whom thereafter devolved\r\nthe subsequent conduct of the war. But we must follow the inexorable\r\nthread of chronological order, and so yield the centre of the stage\r\nfrom June, 1900, on, to Mr. Taft, else the resultant net confusion of\r\nideas about the American occupation of the Philippines might remain\r\nas great as that which this narrative is an attempt in some degree\r\nto correct.\r\n\r\nAll through the official correspondence of 1899 and 1900 between the\r\nAdjutant-General of the Army, General Corbin, and General Otis at\r\nManila, one sees Mr. McKinley's sensitiveness to public opinion. \"In\r\nview of the impatience of the people\" you will do thus and so,\r\nis a typical sample of this feature of that correspondence. [308]\r\nTroubled, possibly, with misgivings, as to whether, after all, in view\r\nof the vigorous and undeniably obstinate struggle for independence\r\nthe Filipinos were putting up, it would not have been wiser to have\r\ndone with them as we had done in the case of Cuba, and troubled,\r\nbeyond the peradventure of a doubt, about the effect of the possible\r\nPhilippine situation on the fortunes of his party and himself in the\r\napproaching campaign for the presidency, Mr. McKinley sent Mr. Taft\r\nout, in the spring preceding the election of 1900, to help General\r\nMacArthur run the war. We must now, therefore, turn our attention to\r\nMr. Taft, not forgetting General MacArthur in so doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE TAFT COMMISSION\r\n\r\n                                    The papers 'id it 'andsome,\r\n                                    But you bet the army knows.\r\n\r\n                                        Kipling, Ballad of the Boer War.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essentials of the situation which confronted the Taft Commission\r\non its arrival in the islands in June, 1900, and the mental attitude\r\nin which they approached that situation, may now be briefly summarized,\r\nwith entire confidence that such summary will commend itself as fairly\r\naccurate to the impartial judgment both of the historian of the future\r\nand of any candid contemporary mind.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to \"vex the dull ear\" of a mighty people much\r\nengrossed with their own affairs, by repetition of any further\r\ndetails concerning the original de facto alliance between Admiral\r\nDewey and Aguinaldo. Suffice it to remind a people whose saving\r\ngrace is a love of fair play, that, after the battle of Manila Bay,\r\nwhen Admiral Dewey brought Aguinaldo down from Hong Kong to Cavite,\r\nboth the Admiral and his Filipino allies were keenly cognizant of the\r\nnational purpose set forth in the declaration of war against Spain,\r\nand that the Filipinos could not have been expected to make any\r\nsubstantial distinction between the casual remarks of a victorious\r\nadmiral on the quarter-deck of his flagship in May, remarks concurrent\r\nand consistent with actual treatment of the Filipinos as allies, and\r\nthe imperious commands of a general ashore in December thereafter,\r\nacting under specific orders pursuant to the Treaty of Paris. The\r\none great fact of the situation, \"as huge as high Olympus,\" they did\r\ngrasp, viz., that both were representatives of America on the ground\r\nat the time of their respective utterances, and that one in December\r\nin effect repudiated without a word of explanation what the other\r\nhad done from May to August. They had helped us to take the city of\r\nManila in August, and, to use the current phrase of the passing hour,\r\ncoined in this period of awakening of the national conscience to\r\na proper attitude toward double-dealing in general, they felt that\r\nthey had been \"given the double cross.\" In other words they believed\r\nthat the American Government had been guilty of a duplicity rankly\r\nMachiavellian. And that was the cause of the war.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the chapters on \"The Benevolent Assimilation\r\nProclamation\" and \"The Iloilo Fiasco\" that, in the Philippines at\r\nany rate, no matter how mellifluously pacific it may have sounded at\r\nhome--no matter how soothing to the troubled doubts of the national\r\nconscience--the Benevolent Assimilation Proclamation of December 21,\r\n1898, was recognized both by the Eighth Army Corps and by Aguinaldo's\r\npeople as a call to arms--a signal to the former to get ready for the\r\nwork of \"civilizing with a Krag\"; a signal to the latter to gird up\r\ntheir loins for the fight to the death for government of their people,\r\nby their people, for their people; and that the yearning benevolence\r\nof said proclamation was calculated strikingly to remind the Filipinos\r\nof Spain's previous traditional yearnings for the welfare of Cuba,\r\nindignantly cut short by us--yearnings \"to spare the great island\r\nfrom the danger of premature independence\" [309] which that decadent\r\nmonarchy could not even help repeating in the swan-song wherein\r\nshe sued to President McKinley for peace. We did not realize the\r\nabsoluteness of the analogy then. It is all clear enough now. We can\r\nnow understand how and why Mr. McKinley's programme of Annexation and\r\nBenevolent Assimilation of 1898-9, blindly earnest as was his belief\r\nthat it would make the Filipino people at once cheerfully forego the\r\n\"legitimate aspirations\" to which we ourselves had originally given\r\na momentum so generous that nothing but bullets could then possibly\r\nhave stopped it, was in fact received by them in a manner compared\r\nwith which Canada's response in 1911 to Speaker Champ Clark's equally\r\nbenevolent suggestion of United States willingness to accord to Canada\r\nalso, gradual Benevolent Assimilation and Ultimate Annexation, was\r\none great sisterly sob of sheer joy as at the finding of a long lost\r\nbrother. From the arrival of the American troops on June 30, 1898,\r\nuntil the outbreak of February 4, 1899, there had been two armies\r\ncamped not far from each other, one born of the idea of independence\r\nand bent upon it, the other at first groping in the dark without\r\ninstructions, and finally instructed to deny independence. There\r\nwas never any faltering or evasion on the part of Aguinaldo and his\r\npeople. They knew what they wanted and said so on all occasions. At\r\nall times and in all places they made it clear, by proclamation, by\r\nletter, by conversation, and otherwise, that independence was the one\r\nthing to which, whether they were fit for it or not, they had pledged\r\n\"their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor.\"\r\n\r\nWe have seen how easily the war itself could have been averted by the\r\nBacon Resolution of January, 1899, or some similar resolution frankly\r\ndeclaring the purpose of our government; how here was Senator Bacon\r\nat this end of the line pleading with his colleagues to be frank,\r\nand to make a declaration in keeping with \"the high purpose\" for\r\nwhich we had gone to war with Spain, instead of holding on to the\r\nPhilippines on the idea that they might prove a second Klondike,\r\nwhile justifying such retention by arbitrarily assuming, without any\r\nknowledge whatever on the subject, that the Filipinos were incapable\r\nof self-government; how, there, at the other end of the line, at\r\nManila, Aguinaldo's Commissioners, familiar with our Constitution\r\nand the history and traditions of our government, were making,\r\nsubstantially, though in more diplomatic language, precisely the\r\nsame plea, and imploring General Otis's Commissioners to give them\r\nsome assurance which would quiet the apprehensions of their people,\r\nand calm the fear that the original assurance, \"We are going to lick\r\nthe Spaniards and set you free,\" was now about to be ignored because\r\nthe islands might be profitable to the United States.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the war itself, as far as it had progressed by June,\r\n1900, one of the bitterest wars in history, punctuated by frequent\r\nbarbarities avenged in kind, and how, if the Taft Commission had\r\nnot come out with McKinley spectacles on, they would have seen the\r\npicture of a bleeding, prostrate, and deeply hostile people, still\r\nbent on fighting to the last ditch, not only animated by a feeling\r\nagainst annexation by us similar to that the Canadians would have\r\nto-day if we should also try the Benevolent Assimilation game on\r\nthem--first with proclamations breathing benevolence and then with\r\ncannon belching grape-shot--but further animated by the instinctive\r\nas well as inherited knowledge common to all colored peoples,\r\nwhether red, yellow brown, or black, that wheresoever white men\r\nand colored live in the same country together, there the white man\r\nwill rule. Understand, this was before Judge Taft had had a chance to\r\nassure them, with the kindly Taft smile and the hearty Taft hand-shake,\r\nthat their benevolent new masters were going to reverse the verdict\r\nof the ages, and treat them with a fraternal love wholly free from\r\nrace prejudice. If Judge Taft could only have arrived in January,\r\n1899, and told them that the Bacon Resolution really represented the\r\nspirit of the attitude of the American people toward them, then the\r\nfinely commanding bearing of Mr. Taft, and the noble genuineness of\r\nhis desire to see peace on earth and goodwill toward men, might even\r\nhave prevented the war. But this is merely what might have been. What\r\nactually was, when he did arrive, in June, 1900, was that the milk of\r\nhuman kindness had long since been spilled, and his task was to gather\r\nit up and put it back in the pail. When I, a Southern man who have\r\ntaken part in the only two wars this nation has had in my lifetime,\r\nreflect that in this year of grace, 1912, Mr. Underwood's otherwise\r\nmatchless availability as the candidate of his party for President is\r\nquestioned on the idea that it might be a tactical blunder, because of\r\n\"the late war,\" which broke out before either Mr. Underwood or myself\r\nwere born, I cannot share the Taft optimism as to the rapidity with\r\nwhich the scars of \"the late war\" in the Philippines will heal, and\r\nas to the affectionate gratitude toward the United States with which\r\nthe McKinley-Taft programme of Benevolent Assimilation will presently\r\nbe regarded by the people of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\nWe have seen the futile efforts of the Schurman Commission of 1899,\r\nsent out that spring, in deference to American public opinion,\r\nwith definite instructions to try and patch up a peace, by talking\r\nto the leading spirits of a war for independence, now in full swing,\r\nabout the desirability of benevolent leading-strings. \"They [meaning\r\nthe Schurman Commission] had come,\" says Mr. McKinley, in his annual\r\nmessage to Congress of December 5, 1899, [310] \"with the hope of\r\nco-operating with Admiral Dewey and General Otis in establishing\r\npeace and order.\" They came, they saw, they went, recognizing the\r\nfutility of the errand on which they had been sent. And now came the\r\nTaft Commission a year later, on precisely the same errand, after the\r\nFilipinos had sunk all their original petty differences and jealousies\r\nin a very reasonable instinctive common fear of economic exploitation,\r\nand a very unreasonable but, to them, very real common fear of race\r\nelimination, amounting to terror, and been welded into absolute\r\noneness--if that were somewhat lacking before--in the fierce crucible\r\nof sixteen months of bloody fighting against a foreign foe for the\r\nindependence of their common country. President McKinley's message to\r\nCongress of December, 1899, is full of the old insufferable drivel,\r\nso grossly, though unwittingly, ungenerous to our army then in the\r\nfield in the Philippines, about the triviality of the resistance\r\nwe were \"up against.\" The message in one place blandly speaks of\r\n\"the peaceable and loyal majority who ask nothing better than to\r\naccept our authority,\" in another of \"the sinister ambitions of a\r\nfew selfish Filipinos.\" Thus was outlined, in the message announcing\r\nthe purpose to send out the Taft Commission, the view that no real\r\nfundamental resistance existed in the islands. Basing contemplated\r\naction on this sort of stuff, the presidential message outlines the\r\npresidential purpose as follows--this in December, 1899, mind you:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is no reason why steps should not be taken from time to\r\n    time to inaugurate governments essentially popular in their form\r\n    as fast as territory is held and controlled by our troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen follows the genesis of the idea which resulted in the Taft\r\nCommission:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To this end I am considering the advisability of the return\r\n    [to the islands] of the commission [the Schurman Commission]\r\n    or such of the members thereof as can be secured.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Cuba, General Wood began the work of reconstruction at Havana with\r\na central government and the best men he could get hold of, and acted\r\nthrough them, letting his plans and purposes percolate downward to\r\nthe masses of the people. Not so in the Philippines. Reconstruction\r\nthere was to begin by establishing municipal governments, to be\r\nlater followed by provincial governments, and finally by a central\r\none; in other words, by placing the waters of self-government at\r\nthe bottom of the social fabric among the most ignorant people,\r\nand letting them percolate up, according to some mysterious law of\r\ngravitation apparently deemed applicable to political physics. Of\r\ncourse, these poor people simply always took their cue from their\r\nleaders, knowing nothing themselves that could affect the success of\r\nthis project except that we were their enemies and that they might get\r\nknocked in the head if they did not play the game. \"I have believed,\"\r\nsays Mr. McKinley, in his message to Congress of December, 1899,\r\n\"that reconstruction should not begin by the establishment of one\r\ncentral civil government for all the islands, with its seat at Manila,\r\nbut rather that the work should be commenced by building up from the\r\nbottom.\" Whereat, the young giant America bowed, in puzzled hope,\r\nand worldly-wise old Europe smiled, in silent but amused contempt.\r\n\r\nIf at the time he formulated this scheme for their government\r\nMr. McKinley had known anything about the Philippines, or the\r\nFilipinos, he would have known that what he so suavely called \"building\r\nfrom the bottom\" was like trying to make water run up hill, i.e.,\r\nlike starting out to have ideas percolate upward, so that through \"the\r\nmasses\" the more intelligent people might be redeemed. The \"nigger\r\nin the woodpile\" lay in the words \"essentially popular in form.\" Of\r\ncourse no government by us \"essentially popular\" was possible at the\r\ntime. But a government \"popular in form\" would sound well to the\r\nAmerican people, and, if they could be kept quiet until after the\r\npresidential election of 1900, maybe the supposed misunderstanding\r\non the part of the Filipinos of the benevolence of our intentions\r\nmight be corrected by kindness. Accordingly, the following spring,\r\ncotemporaneously with General Otis's final departure from Manila to\r\nthe United States, in which free country he might say the war was over\r\nas much as he pleased without being molested with round-robins by Bob\r\nCollins, O. K. Davis, John McCutcheon, and the rest of those banes of\r\nhis insular career, who so pestiferously insisted that the American\r\npublic ought to know the facts, the Taft Commission was sent out,\r\nto \"aid\" General MacArthur, as the Schurman Commission had \"aided\"\r\nGeneral Otis. [311]\r\n\r\nIt would seem fairly beyond any reasonable doubt that the official\r\ninformation the Taft Commission were given by President McKinley\r\nconcerning the state of public order they would find in the islands\r\non arrival was in keeping with the information solemnly imparted\r\nto Congress by him in December thereafter, which was as follows:\r\n\"By the spring of this year (1900) the effective opposition of the\r\ndissatisfied Tagals\"--always the same minimization of the task of the\r\narmy as a sop to the American conscience--\"was virtually ended.\" Then\r\nfollows a glowing picture of how the Filipinos are going to love us\r\nafter we rescue them from the hated Tagal, but with this circumspect\r\nreservation: \"He would be rash who, with the teachings of contemporary\r\nhistory, would fix a limit\" as to how long it will take to produce\r\nsuch a state of affairs. Looking at that mighty panorama of events\r\nfrom the dispassionate standpoint now possible, it seems to me that\r\nMr. McKinley's whole Philippine policy of 1899-1900 was animated by\r\nthe belief that the more the Philippine situation should resemble the\r\nreally identical Cuban one in the estimation of the American people,\r\nthe more likely his Philippine policy was to be repudiated at the\r\npolls in the fall of 1900. The Taft Commission left Washington for\r\nManila in the spring of 1900, after their final conference with the\r\nPresident who had appointed them and was a candidate for re-election in\r\nthe coming fall, as completely committed as circumstances can commit\r\nany man or set of men to the programme of occupation which was to\r\nfollow the subjugation of the inhabitants, and to the proposition\r\nof present incapacity for self-government, its corner-stone;\r\nto say nothing of the embarrassment felt at Washington by reason\r\nof having stumbled into a bloody war with people whom we honestly\r\nwanted to help, had never seen, and had nothing but the kindliest\r\nfeelings for. While the serene and capacious intellect of William\r\nH. Taft was still pursuing the even tenor of its way in the halls of\r\njustice (as United States Circuit Judge for the 8th Circuit), the\r\nPhilippine programme was formulated at Washington. Judge Taft went\r\nto Manila to make the best of a situation which he had not created,\r\nto write the lines of the Deus ex machina for a Tragedy of Errors\r\nup to that point composed wholly by others. It has been frequently\r\nstated and generally believed that when Mr. McKinley sent for him and\r\nproposed the Philippine mission, Judge Taft replied, substantially:\r\n\"Mr. President, I am not the man for the place. I don't want the\r\nPhilippines.\" To which Mr. McKinley is supposed to have replied:\r\n\"You are the man for the place, Judge. I had rather have a man out\r\nthere who doesn't want them.\" The point of the original story lay in\r\nwhat Mr. McKinley said. The point of the repetition of it here lies\r\nin what Mr. Taft said, the inference therefrom being that he did not\r\nthink the true interests of his country \"wanted\" them, and that had\r\nhe been called into President McKinley's council sooner he would have\r\nso advised; an inference warranted by his subsequent admission that\r\n\"we blundered into colonization.\" [312]\r\n\r\nIt is utterly fatal to clear thinking on this great subject, which\r\nconcerns the liberties of a whole people, to treat Judge Taft's reports\r\nas Commissioner to, and later Governor of, the Philippines as in the\r\nnature of a judicial decision on the capacity of the Filipinos for\r\nself-government. When he consented to go out there, he went, not to\r\nreview the findings of the Paris Peace Commission, but at the urgent\r\nsolicitation of an Administration whose fortunes were irrevocably\r\ncommitted to those findings, including the express finding that they\r\nwere unfit for self-government, and the implied one that we must remain\r\nto improve the condition of the inhabitants. He was thus not a judge\r\ncome out to decide on the fitness of the people for self-government,\r\nbut an advocate to make the best possible case for their unfitness, and\r\nits corollary, the necessity to remain indefinitely, just as England\r\nhas remained in Egypt. The war itself convinced the whole army of the\r\nUnited States that Aguinaldo would have been the \"Boss of the Show\"\r\nhad Dewey sailed away from Manila after sinking the Spanish fleet. The\r\nwar satisfied us all that Aguinaldo would have been a small edition\r\nof Porfirio Diaz, and that the Filipino republic-that-might-have-been\r\nwould have been, very decidedly, \"a going concern,\" although Aguinaldo\r\nprobably would have been able to say with a degree of accuracy, as\r\nDiaz might have said in Mexico for so many years, \"The Republic? I\r\nam the Republic.\" The war demonstrated to the army, to a Q. E. D.,\r\nthat the Filipinos are \"capable of self-government,\" unless the kind\r\nwhich happens to suit the genius of the American people is the only\r\nkind of government on earth that is respectable, and the one panacea\r\nfor all the ills of government among men without regard to their\r\ntemperament or historical antecedents. The educated patriotic Filipinos\r\ncan control the masses of the people in their several districts as\r\ncompletely as a captain ever controlled a company. [313] While the\r\nmunicipal officials of the McKinley-Taft municipal kindergarten were\r\nstumbling along with the strange new town government system imported\r\nfrom America, and atoning to their benignant masters for mistakes by\r\nwriting them letters about how benignant they--the teachers--were,\r\nthey--the pupils,--according to the contemporaneous description by the\r\ncommanding general of the United States forces in the islands, were\r\nrunning a superbly efficient municipal system throughout the whole\r\narchipelago, \"simultaneously and in the same sphere as the American\r\ngovernments, and in many instances through the same personnel,\"\r\n[314] in aid of the insurrection. General MacArthur humorously adds\r\nthat the town officials \"acted openly in behalf of the Americans\r\nand secretly in behalf of the insurgents, and, with considerable\r\napparent solicitude for the interest of both.\" In short, the war\r\nat once demonstrated their \"capacity for self-government\" and made\r\ngranting it to them for the time being unthinkable. For the war was\r\nfought not on the issue of the capacity, but on the issue of the\r\ngranting. The Treaty of Paris settled the \"capacity\" part. The army\r\nin 1898, 1899, and 1900 can hardly be said to have had any much more\r\ndecided opinion on the capacity branch of the subject, than Perry did\r\nabout the Japanese in 1854. The Paris Peace Commission having solemnly\r\ndecided the \"capacity part\" adversely to the Filipinos and the war\r\nhaving followed, thereafter Mr. Taft went out to make out the best case\r\npossible in support of the action of the Peace Commission and, ex vi\r\ntermini, in support of everything made necessary by the fact of the\r\npurchase. Unless some one goes out to present to the American people\r\nthe other side of the case, they will never arrive at a just verdict.\r\n\r\nCommitted, a priori, to the task of squaring the McKinley\r\nAdministration with its course as to Cuba, the only course possible\r\nfor the Taft Commission was to set up a benevolent government based\r\nupon the incompetency of the governed, which, being a standing affront\r\nto the intelligence of the people, earns their hatred, however it may\r\ncrave their love. By the very bitterness of the opposition it permits\r\nyet disregards, it binds itself ever more irrevocably to remain a\r\nbenevolent engenderer of malevolence. Government and governed thus get\r\nwider apart as the years go by, and, the raison d'etre of the former\r\nbeing the mental deficiencies of the latter, it must, in self-defence,\r\nassert those deficiencies the more offensively, the more vehemently\r\nthey are denied. What hope therefore can there be that the light\r\nthat shone upon Saul on the road to Damascus will ever break upon\r\nthe President? What hope that he will ever re-attune his ears to the\r\nvoice of the Declaration of Independence, calling down from where\r\nthe Signers (we hope without untoward exception) have gone, crying:\r\n\"William, William, why persecutest thou me? it is hard for thee to\r\nkick against the right of a people to pursue happiness in their own\r\nway\"? The difference between the President and the writer is that\r\nboth went out to scoff and the latter remained--much longer--to pray.\r\n\r\nThe Taft Commission arrived at Manila on June 3, 1900, loaded to the\r\nguards with kindly belief in the stale falsehood wherewith General\r\nOtis, ably assisted by his press censor, had been systematically\r\nsoothing Mr. McKinley's and the general American conscience during\r\nthe whole twenty months he had commanded the Eighth Army Corps, [315]\r\nviz., that the insurrection was due solely to \"the sinister ambitions\r\nof a few selfish leaders,\" and did not represent the wishes of the\r\nwhole people. It is true that the insurrection originally started\r\nunder Admiral Dewey's auspices and under the initial protection of\r\nhis puissant guns was headed by a group of men most of whom, including\r\nAguinaldo, were Tagalos. But all Filipinos look alike, the whole seven\r\nor eight millions of them. They differ from one another not one whit\r\nmore than one Japanese differs from another. And they all feel alike on\r\nmost things, [316] because they all have the same customs, tastes, and\r\nhabits of thought. Said Governor Taft to the Senate Committee in 1902:\r\n\r\n\r\n    While it is true that there are a number of Christian \"tribes,\"\r\n    so-called,--I do not know the number, possibly eight or ten, or\r\n    twelve,--that speak different languages, there is a homogeneity\r\n    in the people in appearance, in habits, and in many avenues of\r\n    thought. To begin with, they are Catholics.\" [317]\r\n\r\n\r\nCertainly this should forever crucify the stale slander, still\r\nignorantly repeated in the United States at intervals, which seeks\r\nto make the American people think the great body of the Filipino\r\npeople are still in a tribal state, ethnologically. [318] A Tagalo\r\nleader is about as much a \"tribal\" leader as is a Tammany \"brave\"\r\nof Irish antecedents. In fact there is much in common between the\r\ntwo. Both are clannish. Both have a genius for organization that\r\nis simply superb. Both are irrepressible about Home Rule. Countless\r\ngenerations ago the Filipinos were lifted by the Spanish priests out\r\nof the tribal state, and the educated people all speak Spanish. But\r\nthe original tribal dialects, which the Spanish priests patiently\r\nmastered and finally reduced for them to a written language, still\r\nsurvive in the several localities of their origin. So that every\r\nFilipino of a well-to-do family is brought up speaking two languages,\r\nSpanish, and the local dialect of his native place, which is the only\r\nlanguage known to the poorer natives of the same neighborhood. Surely\r\neven the valor of ignorance can see that we are presumptuously\r\nseeking to reverse the order of God and nature in assuming that\r\nan alien race can lead a people out of the wilderness better than\r\ncould a government by the leading men of their own race to whom the\r\nless favored look with an ardent pride that would be a guarantee of\r\nloyal and inspiring co-operation. You can beat a balking horse to\r\ndeath but you cannot make him wag his tail, or otherwise indicate\r\ncontentment or a disposition to cordial co-operation which will\r\nmake for progress. Mr. Bryan has visited the Philippines, and his\r\nevidence is simply cumulative of mine, as mine, based on six years'\r\nacquaintance with the Filipinos, is simply cumulative of Admiral\r\nDewey's testimony of 1898, so often cited hereinbefore, and of the\r\nopinion of Hon. George Curry, a Republican member of Congress from\r\nNew Mexico who served eight years in the Philippines, and believes\r\nthey can safely be given their independence by 1921. Mr. Bryan says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    So far as their own internal affairs are concerned, they do not\r\n    need to be subject to any alien government.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe further says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is a wide difference, it is true, between the general\r\n    intelligence of the educated Filipino and the laborer on\r\n    the street and in the field, but this is not a barrier to\r\n    self-government. Intelligence controls in every government,\r\n    except where it is suppressed by military force. Nine tenths of\r\n    the Japanese have no part in the law-making. In Mexico, the gap\r\n    between the educated classes and the peons is fully as great as,\r\n    if not greater than, the gap between the extremes of Filipino\r\n    society. Those who question the capacity of the Filipinos for\r\n    self-government forget that patriotism raises up persons fitted\r\n    for the work that needs to be done.\" [319]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is because I believe that in the Philippines we are doing ourselves\r\nan injustice and keeping back the progress of the world by depreciating\r\nand scoffing at the value of patriotism as a factor in self-government\r\nand in the maintenance of free institutions, that I have written this\r\nbook. There is no more patriotic people in the world than the Filipino\r\npeople. I base this opinion upon an intimate knowledge of them, and\r\nin the light of considerable observation throughout most of Europe,\r\nand in Asia from the Golden Horn to the mouth of the Yang-tse. Woe\r\nto the nonsense, sometimes ignorant, sometimes vicious, wherewith\r\nwe are regaled from time to time by Americans who go to Manila,\r\nsmoke a cigar or two in some American club there, and then come back\r\nhome and depreciate the Filipino people without at least correcting\r\nCol. Roosevelt's wholly uninformed and cruel random assertions of\r\n1900 about the Filipinos being a \"jumble of savage tribes,\" and about\r\nAguinaldo being \"the Osceola of the Filipinos,\" or their \"Sitting\r\nBull!\" It is wonderfully inspiring to turn from such stale slander to\r\nMr. Bryan's above statement of the case for our Oriental subjects,\r\na statement framed in his own infinitely sympathetic and inimitable\r\nway, which says for me just what I had long wanted to express, but\r\ncould not, so well. And in the midst of the recurring slander that the\r\nFilipino people are \"a heterogeneous lot,\" it is refreshing to find in\r\na preface to the American Census of the Philippines of 1903, by the\r\nDirector thereof, a passage where, in comparing the tables of that\r\ncensus with those of the Twelfth Census of the United States, he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"Those of the Philippine Census are somewhat simpler, the\r\n    differences being due mainly to the more homogeneous character\r\n    of the population of the Philippine Islands.\" [320]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the above in the light of the past and present\r\noperation of our own immigration laws, it is not flattering, but it\r\nmay and should tend to awaken some realization of the manifold nature\r\nand blinding effects of current misapprehensions in the United States\r\nconcerning the inhabitants of the Philippines. One Filipino does not\r\ndiffer from another any more than one American does from another\r\nAmerican--in fact they differ less, considering immigration. The\r\nFilipino people are not rendered a heterogeneous lot by having three\r\ndifferent languages, Ilocano, Tagalo, and Visayan, [321] which are\r\nrespectively the languages spoken in the northern, the central,\r\nand the southern part of their country, any more than the people\r\nof Switzerland are rendered heterogeneous by the circumstance that\r\nin northern Switzerland you find German spoken for the most part,\r\nwhile farther south you find French, and near the southernmost\r\nextremities some Italian. At this late date no credible person\r\nacquainted with the facts will be so poor in spirit as to deny that\r\nthe motives of the men who originally started the insurrection were\r\npatriotic. Nor will any one who served under General Otis's command\r\nin the Philippines deny that that eminent desk soldier continued to\r\ncling to his early theory that it was a purely Tagalo insurrection\r\nlong after the deadly unanimity of the opposition had seeped, with\r\nall-pervading thoroughness, into the general mind of the army of\r\noccupation. The white flag or rag of truce, alias treachery, used\r\nto be hoisted to put us off our guard in pretence of welcome to our\r\ncolumns approaching their towns and barrios. Such use of such a flag,\r\nfollowed by treachery, the ultimate weapon of the weak, had been in\r\nturn followed, with relentless impartiality in countless instances,\r\nby due unloosening of the vials of American wrath, until every nipa\r\nshack [322] in the Philippine Islands that remained unburned had\r\nhad its lesson, written in the blood of its occupants or their kin,\r\nto the tune of the Krag-Jorgensen or the Gatling. Yet General Otis's\r\nreports are always bland, and always convey the idea of an insurrection\r\nexclusively Tagalo.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1900, the newly arrived civilians, the Taft\r\nCommission, had no special interest in the soldiers who, for better,\r\nfor worse, were \"doing their country's work,\" as Kipling calls his\r\nown country's countless wars against its refractory subjects in the\r\nfar East; and no especial sympathy with that work. Two years later we\r\nfind President Roosevelt, in connection with the general amnesty of\r\nJuly 4, 1902, congratulating his \"bowld lads,\" as Mr. Dooley would\r\ncall them--meaning General Chaffee and the Eighth Army Corps--on a\r\ntotal of \"two thousand combats, great and small\" up to that time,\r\nbut you never find in any of Governor Taft's Philippine state\r\npapers any more affirmative recognition of continued resistance to\r\nAmerican rule than some mild allusion to \"small but hard knocks\"\r\nbeing administered here and there by the army. From the beginning\r\nthere was a systematic belittling, on the part of the Taft Commission,\r\nof the work of the army, incidentally to belittling the reality and\r\nunanimity of the opposition which was daily calling it forth. [323]\r\nThis was not vicious. It was essentially benevolent. It was part of\r\nthe initial fermentation of their preconceived theory. But the trouble\r\nabout their theory was that it was only a theory. It would not square\r\nwith the facts. They were trying to square the subjugation of the\r\nPhilippines with the freeing of Cuba, a task quite as soluble as the\r\nsquaring of a circle. They hoped, with all the kindly benevolence\r\nof Mr. McKinley himself, that the opposition to our rule was not\r\nas great as some people seemed to think. They had come out to the\r\nislands earnestly wishing to find conditions not as bad as they\r\nhad been asserted to be. And the wish became father to the thought\r\nand the thought soon found expression in words--cablegrams to the\r\nUnited States presenting an optimistic view as to the prospects of\r\nnecessity for further shedding of blood in the interest of Benevolent\r\nAssimilation, alias Trade Expansion. Some flippant person will say,\r\n\"That is a polite way of charging insincerity.\" This book is not\r\naddressed to flippant persons. It is a serious attempt to deal with\r\na problem involving the liberties of a whole people, and will be,\r\nas far as the writer can make it, straightforward, dignified, and\r\ncandid. Judge Taft's fearful mistake of 1900-1901 in the matter of his\r\npremature planting of the civil government--a mistake because based\r\non the idea that \"the great majority of the people\" welcomed American\r\nrule, and a fearful mistake because fraught with so much subsequent\r\nsacrifice of life due to too early withdrawal of the police protection\r\nof the army--was not the first instance in American history where an\r\nordinarily level-headed public man has, with egregious folly, mistaken\r\nthe mood and temper of a whole people. The key to his mistake lay in\r\nthe fact that, coming into a strange country in the midst of a war,\r\nhe ignored the advice of the commanding general of the army of his\r\ncountry concerning the military situation, and took the advice of a\r\nfew native Tories, or Copperheads, of wealth, who had never really\r\nbeen in sympathy with the insurrection and who, flocking about him\r\nas soon as he arrived, told him what he so longed to be told, viz.,\r\nthat the war did not represent the wishes of the people but was kept\r\nup by \"a conspiracy of assassination\" of all who did not contribute\r\nto it either in service or money. He thereupon decided that the men\r\nwho told him this really represented the voice of the people, and\r\nthat the men in the field who had then been keeping up the struggle\r\nfor independence for sixteen months, in season and out of season,\r\nwere simply \"a Mafia on a very large scale.\" Consequently the Taft\r\nCommission had been in the islands less than three months when\r\nSecretary of War Root at Washington was giving the widest possible\r\npublicity to cablegrams from them, such as that dated August 21,\r\n1900, mentioned in the preceding chapter, conveying the glad tidings\r\nthat \"large number of people long for peace and are willing to accept\r\ngovernment under United States\" [324]; and by November next thereafter,\r\nthe \"large number\" had grown to \"a great majority,\" and the \"willing\"\r\nto \"entirely willing.\" The November statement was:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A great majority of the people long for peace and are entirely\r\n    willing to accept the establishment of a government under the\r\n    supremacy of the United States. [325]\r\n\r\n\r\nYet, as we saw in the preceding chapter, the real situation in the\r\nPhilippines at this very time was described four years later at the\r\nRepublican National Convention of 1904 by Mr. Root thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the last national convention met, over 70,000 American\r\n    soldiers from more than 500 stations held a still vigorous enemy\r\n    in check.\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween the date of their arrival in the Islands on June 3d, and the\r\ndate of this August 21st telegram, the Taft Commission did little\r\njunketing, but remained in Manila imbibing the welcome views of the\r\n\"Tories\" or \"Copperheads,\" and seeking very little information from\r\nthe army. But it so happens that the Adjutant-General at Manila used\r\nto keep a record of the daily engagements during that period, which\r\nrecord was later published in the annual War Department Report, [326]\r\nand it shows a total of about five hundred killings (of Filipinos)\r\nbetween June 3d, and August 21st, to say nothing of probably many times\r\nthat number hit but not killed, and therefore able to get away. (You\r\ncould not include any Filipino in your returns of your killings except\r\ndead you had actually counted.) It also happens that on June 4th,\r\nthe day after Judge Taft's arrival, General MacArthur, in response to\r\nan order from Washington sent some time previous at the instance of\r\nCongress, had all the Filipino casualties our military records showed\r\nup to that time (i. e., during the sixteen months from the day of the\r\noutbreak, February 4, 1899, to June 3, 1900), tabulated and totalled,\r\nand the total Filipino killed accordingly reported by cablegram to\r\nthe War Department on June 4, 1900, was 10,780. [327]\r\n\r\nTen thousand in sixteen months is 625 per month. So that by the\r\ntime Judge Taft arrived, the Filipinos had been sufficiently\r\nbeaten into submission to decrease the death-rate due to the\r\nIndependence Bug from something over six hundred per month to about\r\ntwo hundred per month. Judge Taft called this enthusiasm. I call it\r\nexhaustion. Whereupon, exclaims a Boston Anti-Imperialist, \"Why don't\r\nyou issue Mr. Taft a certificate as a member of the Ananias Club at\r\nonce, and be done with it?\" My answer is that I do not believe the\r\nTaft Commission in 1900 either knew these figures or wanted to know\r\nthem. They came out preaching a Gospel of Hope to the exclusion of\r\nall else, a species of mental healing. They said, soothingly to Dame\r\nFilipina, \"Be not afraid; you are well; you are well\"--of the desire\r\nfor independence she had conceived, when what that lady needed was the\r\nsurgical operation indispensable for the removal of a still-born child.\r\n\r\nThe will of the American people is ascertainable, and quadrennially\r\nannounced, through certain prescribed methods. And (nearly)\r\neverybody takes the result good-humoredly, God bless our country,\r\nwhatever the result. But just how Mr. Taft and his colleagues could\r\nassume to speak for the \"great majority\" of the Filipino people at\r\nthe tremendous juncture in their destinies now under consideration\r\nduring the Presidential election of 1900, does not clearly appear,\r\nexcept that in their first report they say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Many witnesses were examined as to the form of government best\r\n    adapted to these islands and satisfactory to the people, [328]\r\n\r\n\r\na statement which obviously takes for granted the only point\r\ninvolved in the war, viz., whether any kind of alien government\r\nwould be \"satisfactory to the people.\" And in their various other\r\ncommunications to Washington they describe themselves, with no small\r\ndegree of benevolent satisfaction, as enthusiastically received by\r\nnatives not under arms at the moment of such reception. As a matter of\r\nfact, a carpet-bag governor of Georgia might just as well have reported\r\nto Andrew Johnson an enthusiastic reception at the hands of the people\r\nwhose homes had lately been put to the torch, and their kith and kin to\r\nthe sword, while the whole fair face of nature from Atlanta to the sea\r\nlay bruised and bleeding under the iron heel of Sherman's army. Let no\r\nadvocate of Indefinite Tutelage whet his scalping-knife for me because\r\nof the use of that word \"carpet-bag.\" It was as free from ill-will\r\nas the explosion incident to flash-light photography. We are trying\r\nto develop a picture of those times. Two at least of the Commission,\r\nMessrs. Taft and Wright, were the kind of men who in all the personal\r\nrelations of life, meet the ultimate test of human confidence and\r\nfriendship--you would make either, if he would consent to act,\r\nexecutor of your will, or testamentary guardian of your child. But\r\nthey came out with the preconceived notion that kindness would win\r\nthe people over, whereas what those people wanted was not foreign\r\nkindness but home rule, not silken political swaddling clothes,\r\nbut freedom. And as the acquisition of the Philippines has placed\r\nus under the necessity of getting up a new definition of freedom,\r\none consistent with tariff taxation without representation--through\r\nlegislation by a Congress on the other side of the world in which\r\n\"our new possessions\" have no vote--it should be added that one of\r\nthe things Freedom meant with us before 1898, was freedom to frame\r\nthe laws--tariff and other--which largely determine the selling\r\nprice of crops and the purchase price of the necessities of life,\r\nfreedom to see the intelligent and educated men of your own race in\r\ncharge of your common destiny, freedom to have a flag as an emblem\r\nof your common interests, in a word, just Freedom. And that was what\r\nthe war was about. They wanted to be free and independent. Whether\r\nthey were fit for such freedom is wholly foreign to the reality and\r\nunanimity of their desire for it. General Otis used to be very fond\r\nof taking the wind out of the sails of their commissioners and other\r\nofficials before the outbreak by saying that their people had not\r\nthe slightest notion of what the word independence meant. It is true\r\nthat they knew nothing about it by experience, but equally true that\r\nwhatever it was, they wanted it. Of the ten thousand men we had already\r\nkilled when Judge Taft arrived, there can be no question, as already\r\nheretofore suggested, that many of them may have been hit just as\r\nthey were hurrahing for independence, in other words, died with the\r\nword \"Independence\" on their lips. When men have been thus fighting\r\nagainst overwhelming odds for some sixteen months for government of\r\ntheir people by their people for their people--however inarticulate\r\nthe emotions of the rank and file on going into battle--it is idle\r\nto claim that they do not know what they want, whether the great\r\nmajority of the rank and file can read and write or not. But pursuant\r\nto the idea that kindness would cure the desire for independence,\r\nJudge Taft ignored, in the outset, all advice from the military\r\ndepartment, because that was not the kindness department, accepting\r\nas truly representative of the temper of the whole people the views\r\nof a few ultra-conservatives of large means who had always been part\r\nand parcel of the Spanish Administration.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, General MacArthur and the whole Eighth Army Corps\r\nhad seen a great insurrection drag on from month to month and from one\r\nyear to another, under General Otis, when short shrift would have been\r\nmade of it in the outset, and far less life sacrificed, if Mr. McKinley\r\nhad not needed, in aid of his Philippine policy, the support of both\r\nof those who believed it was right and of those who believed it would\r\npay. The one central thought which had seemed to animate General\r\nOtis from the beginning, a thought which we have already traced\r\nthrough all its humiliating manifestations, was that he must neither\r\ndo or permit anything that might hurt the Administration. When the\r\n\"impatience of the people\" at home, which figures so prominently in\r\nthe correspondence already cited between the Adjutant General of the\r\narmy, General Corbin, and General Otis at Manila, had begun to cast its\r\nshadows on the presidential year, 1900, the master mind of Mr. Root had\r\ninterrupted the fatal Otis treatment of the insurrection, indicated by\r\nGeneral Otis's long failure to call for volunteers, his stupid stream\r\nof \"situation well in hand\" and \"insurrection about to collapse\"\r\ntelegrams, and his utterly unpardonable persistence in calling it a\r\npurely \"Tagalo insurrection,\" by sending him a competent force, and\r\na plan of campaign, and directing him to carry out the plan. General\r\nOtis did this, because he was told to, and then began again to sing\r\nthe same old song. MacArthur, Wheaton, Lawton, Bates, Young, Funston,\r\nand the rest of the fighting generals, had submitted to all the Otis\r\nfollies without a murmur, because insubordination degrades an army\r\ninto a rabble. But they [329] believed the army was there to put down\r\nthat insurrection, not to have a symposium with its leaders on the\r\nrights of man. They had taken up \"The White Man's Burden,\" after the\r\nmanner of Lords Kitchener and Roberts, and they had no qualms. Above\r\nall, they wanted peace, no matter how much fighting it took to get\r\nit. Mindful of the attempts of the Schurman Commission of the year\r\nbefore to mix peace with war, and of the immense encouragement thus\r\ngiven the insurgents, they had not looked forward with enthusiasm to\r\nthe coming of the Taft Commission, and to the highly probable renewal\r\nof negotiations with the insurgent leaders in the field, pursuant to\r\na presidential policy of patching up a peace at any price, suggested\r\nby the exigencies of political expediency, to give the government a\r\nsemblance of having more or less of the consent of the governed. That\r\nthe anticipations of the military authorities in this regard did not\r\nreceive a pleasant disappointment, has already been suggested by the\r\nnature of the views adopted by the commission soon after its arrival.\r\n\r\nThe military view of the situation, as it stood when Judge Taft and his\r\ncolleagues arrived at Manila in June, 1900, is set forth in the annual\r\nreport of the commanding general, General MacArthur, rendered shortly\r\nthereafter; rendered, not in aid of any political candidate at home,\r\nnor of a sudden, but at the usual and customary annual season for the\r\nmaking of such reports; and rendered by a soldier of no mean experience\r\nand ability, who was a man of great kindliness of heart as well, to\r\nthe war department of his government, to acquaint it with the facts\r\nof a military situation he had been dealing with for two years prior\r\nto the arrival of the Taft Commission. General MacArthur's views,\r\nas expressed in his report, must now be contrasted with the Taft\r\nview, not to show that MacArthur is a bigger man than Taft, nor for\r\nany other idle or petty purpose, but because, if, in 1900, General\r\nMacArthur was right, and Judge Taft was wrong, about the unanimity\r\nof the whole Filipino people against us, then the institution of the\r\nCivil Government of the Philippines on July 4, 1901, was premature;\r\nand, therefore, by reason of the withdrawal of the strong arm of the\r\nmilitary at a critical period of public order, it was not calculated\r\nto give adequate protection to the lives and property of those who\r\nwere willing to abandon the struggle for independence and submit\r\nto our rule. And if, as we shall see later, it did in fact grossly\r\nfail to afford such adequate protection for life and property, it was\r\nderelict in the most sacred duty enjoined upon it by Mr. McKinley's\r\ninstructions to the Taft Commission. But first let me introduce you\r\nto General MacArthur.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur is not only a soldier of a high order of\r\nability, but a statesman as well. Moreover, he was a thoroughgoing\r\n\"expansionist.\" He believed in keeping the Philippines permanently,\r\njust as England does her colonies. But he was perfectly honest about\r\nit. He recognized the fact that they were against our rule. But\r\nhe did not attach any more weight to that circumstance than Lord\r\nKitchener would have done. Also, he had come out to the islands with\r\nthe first expedition, in 1898, had been in the field continuously\r\nfor fifteen months prior to assuming supreme military command, and\r\nknew the Filipinos thoroughly. As soon as he took command, on May 5,\r\n1900, of the 70,000 troops then in the Islands, he set himself with\r\npatience and firmness to the great task of ending the insurrection,\r\nwhich at that time promised to continue indefinitely, the far more\r\nformidable guerrilla warfare that had followed the brief period of\r\nserried resistance having now settled down to a chronic stage, aided\r\nand abetted by the whole population. I have said General MacArthur was\r\na \"thoroughgoing\" expansionist. This needs a slight qualification. At\r\nfirst he appears to have had a few qualms. Shortly after the outbreak\r\nof the war with the Filipinos, when he took the first insurgent capital\r\nMalolos, in March, 1899, he had said at Malolos, as we have seen,\r\nto a newspaper man who accompanied the expedition:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When I first started in against these rebels, I believed that\r\n    Aguinaldo's troops represented only a faction. I did not believe\r\n    that the whole population of Luzon was opposed to us; but I have\r\n    been reluctantly compelled to believe that the Filipinos are\r\n    loyal to Aguinaldo and the government which he represents. [330]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur's reports concerning the war in the Philippines\r\nduring the period of his command are succinct and luminous. He\r\nmakes it perfectly clear that the original resistance offered by the\r\ninsurgent armies in the field after the arrival of the overwhelmingly\r\nample reinforcements sent out from this country in the fall of 1899,\r\nwas little more than a mere flash in the pan, compared with the\r\nwell-planned scheme of resistance which followed the dispersion of\r\nthose armies to the several provinces which had furnished them to\r\nthe cause, and Aguinaldo's simultaneous flight into the mountains\r\n\"with his government concealed about his person,\" as Senator Lodge\r\nexultantly described that incident in his speech of April, 1900,\r\nin defence of the Administration's Philippine policy. Speaking of\r\nthis period, General MacArthur says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It has since been ascertained that the expediency of adopting\r\n    guerrilla warfare from the inception of hostilities was seriously\r\n    discussed by the native leaders, and advocated with much emphasis\r\n    as the system best adapted to the peculiar conditions of the\r\n    struggle. It was finally determined, however, that a concentrated\r\n    field army, conducting regular operations, would, in the event\r\n    of success, attract the favorable attention of the world, and be\r\n    accepted as a practical demonstration of capacity for organization\r\n    and self-government. The disbandment of the field army, therefore,\r\n    having been a subject of contemplation from the start, the actual\r\n    event, in pursuance of the deliberate action of the council of\r\n    war in Bayambang about November 12, 1899 (already hereinbefore\r\n    noticed), was not regarded by Filipinos in the light of a calamity,\r\n    but simply as a transition from one form of action to another;\r\n    a change which by many was regarded as a positive advantage,\r\n    and was relied upon to accomplish more effectively the end in\r\n    view. The Filipino idea behind the dissolution of their field\r\n    army was not at the time of the occurrence well understood in\r\n    the American camp. As a consequence, misleading conclusions\r\n    were reached to the effect that the insurrection itself had been\r\n    destroyed, and that it only remained to sweep up the fag ends of\r\n    the rebel army by a system of police administration not likely\r\n    to be either onerous or dangerous. [331]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his report covering the period from May 5th, to October 1, 1900,\r\nGeneral MacArthur says of the policy of resistance above outlined:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The country affords great advantages for the practical\r\n    development of such a policy. The practice of discarding the\r\n    uniform enables the insurgents to appear and disappear almost at\r\n    their convenience. At one time they are in the ranks as soldiers,\r\n    and immediately thereafter are within the American lines in\r\n    the attitude of peaceful natives, absorbed in a dense mass of\r\n    sympathetic people. [332]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this same connection the report includes a copy of the original\r\norder of the insurgent government which was the corner stone of the\r\nguerrilla policy, and states that \"systemized regulations\" for its\r\neffective prosecution throughout the archipelago had been compiled\r\nand published by the Filipino junta, or revolutionary committee at\r\nMadrid, and distributed among the insurgent forces. The report also\r\nappends a copy of the \"Army Regulations\" under which the insurgent\r\nforces were to conduct the guerrilla warfare. It also describes in\r\ndetail the system of warfare prescribed under these regulations, and\r\nstates that as a result of the measures which he, General MacArthur,\r\ntook to combat that warfare \"the 53 stations of American troops\r\noccupied in the archipelago on November 1, 1899, had on September 1,\r\n1900, expanded to 413,\" and that during this period, the casualties\r\nto our troops were 268 killed, 750 wounded, 55 captured, and to the\r\ninsurgents, so far as our records showed, 3227 killed, 694 wounded,\r\nand 2864 captured. Says he:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The extensive distribution of troops has strained the soldiers\r\n    of the army to the full limit of endurance. Each little command\r\n    has had to provide its own service of security and information\r\n    by never ceasing patrols, explorations, escorts, outposts, and\r\n    regular guards. An idea seems to have been established in the\r\n    public mind [he meant the public mind at home, of course] that the\r\n    field work of the army is in the nature of police, in regulating a\r\n    few bands of guerrillas, and involving none of the vicissitudes of\r\n    war. [Here he is meeting the Otis theory, then being industriously\r\n    circulated in the United States.] Such a narrow statement of the\r\n    case is unfair to the service. In all things requiring endurance,\r\n    fortitude, and patient diligence, the guerrilla period has been\r\n    pre-eminent. It is difficult for the non-professional observer\r\n    [he means Judge Taft] to understand that apparently desultory\r\n    work, such as has prevailed in the Philippines during the past\r\n    ten months, [333] has demanded more of discipline and as much\r\n    of valor as was required during the period of regular operations\r\n    against the concentrated field forces of the insurrection. It is,\r\n    therefore, a great privilege to speak warmly in respect of the\r\n    importance of the service rendered day by day, with unremitting\r\n    vigilance, by the splendid men who,\" etc. [334]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until July 4, 1902, that President Roosevelt officially\r\ndeclared, by his amnesty proclamation of that date that the\r\ninsurrection in the Philippines was at last ended. It was by no\r\nmeans beaten to a frazzle, as we shall later see. But of course,\r\nknowing the impatience of a large portion of the American people with a\r\nsituation about which there was a wide-spread notion that much remained\r\nundisclosed, Mr. Roosevelt would have issued such a proclamation\r\nearlier, had the facts seemed to him to so authorize. General\r\nMacArthur's relentless \"never ceasing patrols, explorations,\" etc.,\r\ncontinued straight on through the presidential campaign of 1900 side\r\nby side in point of time with the roseate Taft cablegrams of the same\r\nperiod, and long thereafter--how long will be later indicated. Says\r\nGeneral MacArthur, in his report for 1901:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It had been suggested that some of the Filipino leaders were\r\n    willing to submit the issue to the judgment of the American people,\r\n    which was soon to be expressed at the polls, and to abide by\r\n    the result of the presidential election of November, 1900. [335]\r\n    But subsequent events demonstrated that the hope of ending the\r\n    war without further effusion of blood was not well founded,\r\n    and that as a matter of fact the Filipinos were organizing for\r\n    further desperate resistance by means of a general banding of\r\n    the people in support of the guerrillas in the field. [336]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur then goes on to tell how, as part of this programme,\r\nthe insurgent authorities,\r\n\r\n\r\n    announced a primal and inflexible principle, to the effect that\r\n    every native, without any exception, residing within the limits\r\n    of the archipelago, owed active allegiance to the insurgent\r\n    cause. This jurisdiction was enjoined under severe penalties,\r\n    which were systematically enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what Judge Taft afterwards described as \"a conspiracy of\r\nmurder, a Mafia on a very large scale\", [337] the characterization\r\nbeing made in support of his theory that \"the great majority of the\r\npeople\" with whom we were then at war would welcome our rule if allowed\r\nto follow their real preferences, and that they were being cruelly\r\ncoerced to fight for the independence of their country. General\r\nMacArthur's view, however, did not support this theory. His report\r\ndeals with this branch of the subject thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cohesion of Filipino society in behalf of insurgent\r\n    interests is most emphatically illustrated by the fact that\r\n    assassination, which was extensively employed, was generally\r\n    accepted as a legitimate expression of insurgent governmental\r\n    authority. The individuals marked for death would not appeal to\r\n    American protection, although condemned exclusively on account\r\n    of supposed pro-Americanism.\r\n\r\n\r\nLater on, when we came to understand the Filipinos better, this\r\nsummary method of dealing with the faint-hearted lost much of its\r\ninitial horrifying force, and the failure of such to appeal to us for\r\nprotection lost much of its strangeness. In the first place, nobody\r\nloves a traitor. Even those to whom he claims to have betrayed his\r\ncountrymen do not trust him implicitly. Again, Latin countries never\r\nassume that before a man is punished for alleged crime he has been\r\nconfronted with the witnesses against him. Such testimony is, under\r\ntheir jurisprudence, frequently received in his absence. The legal\r\ndepartment of General MacArthur's office once got hold of a captured\r\ninsurgent paper subscribed with the autograph of Juan Cailles, one\r\nof their best generals. It directed that a named Filipino residing\r\nin a certain town garrisoned by American troops be executed--we\r\nof course, would call it \"assassinated\"--at a certain hour on a\r\ncertain day in a public street of the town, and that the soldier or\r\nsoldiers performing the \"execution\" should declare to the bystanders,\r\nif any, in so doing, that it was done because the man was a traitor,\r\na friend of the Americans. We kept this paper, intending to hang Juan\r\nwhenever he should be captured. He held out a long time, and finally\r\nsurrendered unconditionally--but he proved such an elegant fellow,\r\ngame as a pebble, courteous as Chesterfield, and immensely popular\r\nwith his people, that it was decided he could be of more service\r\nas a live governor of a province than he could as a dead general,\r\n[338] so he was appointed a provincial governor by Governor Taft,\r\nand made a splendid official.\r\n\r\nAnother reason why Filipinos suspected, during the insurrection, by\r\nthe more obstinate and stout-hearted of their compatriots who held\r\nout longer in the struggle for independence, of weakening toward the\r\ncause of their country, in other words, suspected of what might be\r\ncalled \"Copperhead\" or \"Tory\" tendencies, would not appeal to us for\r\nprotection, is strikingly presented in General MacArthur's report for\r\n1901. He says they naturally had \"grave doubt as to the wisdom\" of\r\nsiding with us, \"as the United States had made no formal announcement\r\nof an inflexible purpose to hold the archipelago and afford protection\r\nto pro-Americans.\" [339]\r\n\r\nThe one great thing that has crippled progress in the Philippines\r\nfrom the beginning of the American occupation down to date is the\r\nuncertainty as to what our policy for the future is to be, the lack of\r\nsome, \"formal announcement of an inflexible purpose.\" And of course\r\nI mean, as General MacArthur meant, by \"formal\" announcement, an\r\nauthoritative declaration by the law-making power of the government. If\r\nCongress should formally declare that it is the purpose of this\r\ngovernment to hold the Philippines permanently, American and other\r\ncapital would at once go there in abundance and the place would\r\n\"blossom like a rose.\" If, on the other hand, Congress should formally\r\ndeclare that it is the purpose of this government to give the Filipinos\r\ntheir independence as soon as a stable native government can be set up,\r\nthus holding out to the present generation the prospect of living to\r\nsee the independence of their country, the place would also quickly\r\nblossom as aforesaid, through the generous ardor of native love of\r\ncountry. In either event, everybody out there would know where he is\r\n\"at.\" At present all is uncertainty, both with the resident members\r\nof the dominant alien race, and with those over whom we are ruling.\r\n\r\nIt took over 120,000 American troops, first and last, to put down\r\nthe struggle of the Filipinos for independence. [340] The war began\r\nFebruary 4, 1899, and the last public official announcement that it\r\nwas ended was on July 4, 1902. [341] Of course this does not imply\r\nthat every province was at all times during that period a theatre\r\nof actual war. Putting down the insurrection was something like\r\nputting out a fire in a field of dry grass. At first the trouble was\r\ngeneral. Gradually it diminished toward the end. But for a while,\r\nno sooner was it quenched in one province than it would break out\r\nin another. How the Filipinos were able to prolong the struggle\r\nas long as they did against such apparently overwhelming odds is\r\nmost interestingly explained by General MacArthur in his report\r\nfor 1900. After describing the method he followed of establishing\r\nnative municipal governments in territory as conquered, he says,\r\nwith a patient stateliness that is almost humorous:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The institution of municipal government under American auspices,\r\n    of course, carried the idea of exclusive fidelity to the sovereign\r\n    power of the United States. All the necessary moral obligations\r\n    to that end were readily assumed by municipal bodies, and all\r\n    outward forms of loyalty and decorum carefully preserved. But\r\n    precisely at this point the psychologic conditions referred to\r\n    above [meaning the unity against us], [342] began to work with\r\n    great energy, in assistance of insurgent field operations. For this\r\n    purpose most of the towns secretly organized complete insurgent\r\n    municipal governments, to proceed simultaneously and in the\r\n    same sphere as the American governments and in many instances\r\n    through the same personnel--that is to say, the presidentes\r\n    and town officials acted openly in behalf of the Americans and\r\n    secretly in behalf of the insurgents, and, paradoxical as it may\r\n    seem, with considerable apparent solicitude for the interests\r\n    of both. In all matters touching the peace of the town, the\r\n    regulation of markets, the primitive work possible on roads,\r\n    streets, and bridges, and the institution of schools, their open\r\n    activity was commendable; at the same time they were exacting and\r\n    collecting contributions and supplies and recruiting men for the\r\n    Filipino forces, and sending all obtainable military information\r\n    to the Filipino leaders. Wherever, throughout the archipelago,\r\n    there is a group of the insurgent army, it is a fact beyond\r\n    dispute, that all contiguous towns contribute to the maintenance\r\n    thereof. In other words, the towns, regardless of the fact of\r\n    American occupation and town organization, are the actual bases\r\n    for all insurgent military activities; and not only so in the\r\n    sense of furnishing supplies for the so-called flying columns of\r\n    guerrillas, but as affording secure places of refuge. Indeed, it\r\n    is now the most important maxim of Filipino tactics to disband\r\n    when closely pressed and seek safety in the nearest barrio;\r\n    a manoeuvre quickly accomplished by reason of the assistance\r\n    of the people and the ease with which the Filipino soldier is\r\n    transformed into the appearance of a peaceful native. [343]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo contrast a cold, hard military fact involving the lives of American\r\nsoldiers with a lot of political nonsense intended for consumption in\r\nthe United States during a presidential election, the next paragraph is\r\nparticularly interesting in the light of the cotemporaneous Taft view:\r\n[344]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The success of this unique system of war depends upon almost\r\n    complete unity of action of the entire native population. That such\r\n    unity is a fact is too obvious to admit of discussion. Intimidation\r\n    has undoubtedly accomplished much to this end, but fear as the\r\n    only motive is hardly sufficient to account for the united and\r\n    apparently spontaneous action of several millions of people. [345]\r\n    One traitor in each town would effectually destroy such a complex\r\n    organization.\r\n\r\n\r\nThen follows this bit of grim humor:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is more probable that the adhesive principle comes from\r\n    ethnological homogeneity which induces men to respond for a time\r\n    to the appeals of consanguineous leadership--\r\n\r\n\r\nin other words, to stick to their own kith and kin. He had in a\r\nprevious paragraph used that very expression thus: \"The people seem to\r\nbe actuated by the idea that in politics or war men are never nearer\r\nright then when going with their own kith and kin.\"\r\n\r\nIn all the foregoing, General MacArthur was not simply trying to score\r\na point against Judge Taft, though his resentment of the effort of the\r\nTaft Commission of 1900 to mix politics with war in the presidential\r\nyear was quite as decided, and quite as well known in the islands at\r\nthe time, as was General Otis's similar attitude toward the Schurman\r\nCommission of the previous year. [346] He is simply laying before\r\nthe War Department, as a soldier, the familiar facts of a situation\r\nwhich he had been dealing with for two years past, as well known to\r\nthe 70,000 officers and men under his command as to himself. And as\r\nthe details into which he goes are simply prefatory to an account of\r\nthe remedy he applied to the situation, that remedy must now claim\r\nour attention. The remedy General MacArthur finally applied was\r\na proclamation, explaining to the Filipino people--\"to all classes\r\nthroughout the archipelago,\" it read, and especially to the leaders in\r\nthe field, many of whose captured comrades-in-arms he had now become\r\nthoroughly acquainted with--the severities sanctioned by the laws of\r\ncivilized nations under such circumstances, and the reasons therefor;\r\nand, further, serving them with notice that thenceforward he proposed\r\nto enforce those laws with full rigor. [347]\r\n\r\nThe eminent lawyers of the Taft Commission were too busy about that\r\ntime acquainting themselves with the situation through natives not in\r\narms, to attach much importance to General MacArthur's proclamation,\r\nbut the Eighth Army Corps always believed that that proclamation,\r\nand the army's work under it, was the main factor in making the\r\ncivil government at all possible by the date it was set up, July 4,\r\n1901. The issuance of this document was not only a wise military move,\r\nbut a subtle stroke of statesmanship as well. It assumed that the\r\nFilipino people were a civilized people, an assumption never indulged\r\nby Spain during the whole of her rule, but always freely admitted by\r\nGeneral MacArthur in all his dealings with their leading men to be a\r\nfact. It therefore appealed to their amour propre, and to the noblesse\r\noblige of many of the most obstinate and trusted fighting leaders. The\r\nwriter was, at the date of the proclamation under consideration,\r\non duty at General MacArthur's headquarters, as assistant to Colonel\r\nCrowder, his judge advocate, now Judge Advocate General of the United\r\nStates Army, and prepared the first rough, tentative suggestions\r\nfor the final draft of it, accompanying such suggestions with a\r\nmemorandum showing the course taken by Wellington in France in 1815,\r\nand by Bismarck's generals at the close of the Franco-Prussian War,\r\nas well as that followed under General Order No. 100, 1863, for the\r\ngovernment of the armies of the United States in the field. Having then\r\nentertained the opinion that that proclamation, though drastic, was\r\nwise and right under the facts of the situation which confronted us,\r\nand having nowise changed that opinion since, it may be well for the\r\nwriter of this book to explain his reasons for that opinion. This must\r\nbe done wholly without reference to \"the authorities,\" for neither at\r\nthe bar of public opinion, nor at the bar of final judgment, do \"the\r\nauthorities\" count for much. In so doing, however, we must start with\r\nthe assumption that it was a case of American military occupation of\r\nhostile territory, notwithstanding that Judge Taft began soon after\r\nhis arrival in the islands in the June previous to the December now\r\nreferred to, to cable home impressions which, if correct, amounted\r\nto a denial that the great body of the people were hostile. Military\r\noccupation is a fact which admits of no debate, and the necessity\r\nof making your country's flag respected is always fully and keenly\r\nrecognized as the one supreme consideration by every good American\r\nexcept one who, obsessed with the idea that kindness will cure the\r\ndesire of a people for independence, proceeds to act on that idea in\r\nthe midst of a war for independence.\r\n\r\nUnder the laws of war the commanding general of the occupying force\r\nowes protection, both of life and property, to all persons residing\r\nwithin the territory occupied. The object of General MacArthur's\r\nproclamation was to put a stop to such \"executions,\" or assassinations,\r\nas that perpetrated by Juan Cailles, mentioned above, and to separate\r\nthe insurgents in the field from their main reliance, the towns. The\r\nlatter end of a bloody war is no time for a discussion of the causes\r\nof the war between victor and vanquished. Nor is it any time to\r\nbelieve the representative of the enemy who tells you that most of\r\nhim is really in sympathy with you and merely coerced. Your duty is to\r\nstop the war. You and your enemy having had a difference, and having\r\nreferred it to the arbitrament of war, which is, unfortunately, at\r\npresent the only human jurisdiction having power to enforce decisions\r\nconcerning such differences, if you win, and your enemy refuses to\r\nabide the decision, he is simply, as it were in contempt of court, and,\r\nin the scheme of things, as at present ordered, deserves punishment\r\nas an enemy to the general peace. To state the ethics of the matter\r\njuridically, \"there should be an end of litigation\"--somewhere.\r\n\r\nI do not believe in the doctrine that might makes right, and I cherish\r\nthe high hope that this human family of ours will survive to see war\r\nsuperseded, as the ultimate arbiter, by something more like heaven and\r\nless like hell. But in the Philippines in 1900 it was a situation,\r\nnot a theory, that confronted us, and, as far as my consciously\r\nfallible thinking apparatus lights the way which then lay before us,\r\nthat way led to a shrine whereon was written \"A life for a life.\" This\r\nis no mere academic discussion. With me it is a tremendously practical\r\none. In the gravest possible acceptation of the term it is awe-fully\r\nso. If I am wrong, every execution I approved by memorandum review\r\nfurnished Colonel Crowder and General MacArthur, of military commission\r\nfindings out there was wrong, and so were a number of the executions I\r\nordered as a judge appointed by Governor Taft under a government which,\r\nthough nominally a civil government, was no more \"civil\" in so far as\r\nthat term implies absence of necessity for the presence of military\r\nforce, than other governments immediately following conquest usually\r\nare. The propriety of the imposition of capital punishment by the\r\nconstituted authorities of a nation as part of a set policy to make its\r\nsovereignty respected, is wholly independent of whether you call your\r\ncolonial government a civil or a military one. So that in justifying\r\nGeneral MacArthur I am also justifying Governor Taft, and as it was\r\non the recommendation of the former that the latter appointed me to\r\nthe Bench, we are certainly all three in the same boat in the matter\r\nof the capital punishments under consideration. And while the company\r\nyou were in on earth in a given transaction, however distinguished\r\nthat company, is not going to help you with the Recording Angel,\r\n[348] still, it is some comfort to know that wiser and abler men than\r\nyourself approved a course of imposing capital punishments to which\r\nyou were a party, such punishments having been inflicted as part of a\r\npolicy whose subsequent evolution revealed it to you as fundamentally\r\nwrong. And this reflection is quite relevant in the present connection\r\nto the question whether the government of Benevolent Assimilation we\r\nhave maintained over the Filipinos for the last fourteen years is one\r\nwhich was originally imposed by force against their will, or whether\r\nit was ever welcomed by them or any considerable fraction of them.\r\n\r\nThat the MacArthur proclamation of December 20, 1900, concerning the\r\nlaws of war, was at the time a military necessity, is as perfectly\r\nclear to me now as it was then. And yet it may well give the thoughtful\r\nand patriotic American pause. It is sometimes difficult to understand\r\nwhy men are so often entirely willing to go on fighting and dying in\r\na cause they must know to be hopeless. The famous passage of Edmund\r\nBurke's speech on \"Conciliation with America,\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    If I were an American, as I am an Englishman, so long as foreign\r\n    troops remained on my native soil, I never would lay down my arms,\r\n    no, never, never, never!\r\n\r\n\r\nsounds well to us, but from the standpoint of a conqueror, there is\r\na good deal of wind-jamming to it, after all. It was the language of\r\na man who knew nothing of the horrors of war by actual experience,\r\nor of what hell it slowly becomes to everybody concerned after most\r\nof the high officials of the vanquished government have been captured\r\nand are sleeping on dry, warm beds, eating good wholesome food, and\r\nsmoking good cigars, in comfortable custody, while the vanquished\r\narmy, no longer strong enough to come out in the open and fight, is\r\nrelegated to ambuscades and other tactics equally akin to the methods\r\nof the assassin. The law of nations in this regard is an expression\r\nof the views of successive generations of civilized and enlightened\r\nmen of all nations whose profession was war--men familiar with the\r\nhorrors inevitably incident to it and anxious to mitigate them as far\r\nas possible. That law represents the common consensus of Christendom\r\nresulting from that experience. It recognizes that after resistance\r\nbecomes utterly hopeless, it becomes a crime against society and\r\nthe general peace, and this is wholly independent of the merits\r\nor demerits of the questions involved in the war. In other words,\r\nthe greatest good of the greatest number cries aloud that the war\r\nmust stop. The cold, hard fact is that the great majority of the men\r\nwho hold out longest are, usually, either single men having no one\r\ndependent on them, or nothing to lose, or both, or else they are men\r\nmore or less indifferent to the ties of family affection, and callous\r\nto the suffering fruitlessly entailed upon innocent noncombatants\r\nby the various and sundry horrors of war, such as decimation of\r\nthe plough animals of the country due to their running at large\r\nwithout caretakers or forage; resultant untilled fields and scant\r\nfood; pestilence and famine consequent upon insufficient nourishment;\r\narson, robbery, rape, and murder inevitably committed in such times\r\nby sorry scamps and ruffians claiming to be patriots but yielding no\r\nallegiance to any responsible head; and so on, ad infinitum.\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur's proclamation of December 20, 1900, served\r\nnotice on the leaders of a hopeless cause that assassinations, such\r\nas that ordered by Juan Cailles, above mentioned, must stop; that\r\nthe universal practice of the townfolk, of sending money, supplies,\r\nand information concerning our movements to the enemy in the field,\r\nmust stop; that participating in hostilities intermittently, in\r\ncitizen garb, followed by return to home and avocation when too\r\nhard pressed, must stop; in short that the war must stop. Yet the\r\nproclamation explained in so firm and kindly a way why the penalties\r\nit promised were only reasonable under the circumstances, that \"as an\r\neducational document the effect was immediate and far-reaching,\" [349]\r\nto quote from an opinion expressed by its author in the body of it,\r\nan opinion entirely consistent with modesty and fully justified by\r\nthe facts. General MacArthur also goes on to say of his unrelenting\r\nand rigid enforcement of the terms of this proclamation that the\r\nresults \"preclude all possibility of doubt * * * that the effective\r\npacification of the archipelago commenced December 20, 1900\"--its\r\ndate. It is a part of the history of those times, familiar to all who\r\nare familiar with them, that the Taft Civil Commission thought its\r\nassurances of the benevolent intentions of our government were what\r\nmade the civil government possible by midsummer, 1901. But whatever\r\nthe Filipinos may think of us at present, now that they understand us\r\nbetter, certainly in 1900-01, in view of the events of the preceding\r\ntwo or three years, which formed the basis of the only acquaintance\r\nthey then had with us, and in view of the fact that their experience\r\nfor the preceding two or three hundred years had made force the only\r\neffective governmental argument with them, and governmental promises a\r\nmere mockery, and in view of the fact that the \"never-ceasing patrols,\r\nexplorations, escorts, outposts,\" etc., of General MacArthur's 70,000\r\nmen were relentlessly kept up during the six months immediately\r\nfollowing the proclamation and in aid of it, it at once becomes\r\nobvious how infinitesimal a fraction of the final partial pacification\r\nwhich made the civil government possible, the Taft assurances to the\r\nFilipinos as to our intentions must have been. These matters are of\r\nprime importance to any honest effort toward a clear understanding of\r\npresent conditions, because far and away the greatest wrong which we,\r\nin our genuinely benevolent misinformation, have done the Filipinos,\r\nnot even excepting the tariff legislation perpetrated upon them by\r\nCongress, lies in the insufferably hypocritical pretence that they\r\never consented to our rule, or that they consent to it now--a pretence\r\nconceived in 1898 by Trade Expansion, to beguile a nation the breath of\r\nwhose own life is political liberty based on consent of the governed,\r\ninto a career of conquest, but not even countenanced since by those\r\nwho believe the Government should go into the politico-missionary\r\nbusiness, after the manner of Spain in the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nHaving now exhaustively examined the differences of opinion between\r\nJudge Taft and General MacArthur, when the former set to work,\r\nin the summer of 1900, to get a civil government started by the\r\ndate of expiration of the term of enlistment of the volunteer army\r\n(June 30, 1901), let us follow the facts of the situation up to the\r\ndate last named, or, which is practically the same thing, up to the\r\ninauguration of Judge Taft as Civil Governor of the islands on July 4,\r\n1901, pausing, in passing, for such reflections as may force themselves\r\nupon us as pertinent to the Philippine problem of to-day.\r\n\r\nOn September 19, 1900, General MacArthur wired Secretary of War\r\nRoot--General Corbin, the Adjutant-General of the Army, to be exact,\r\nbut it is the same thing--describing what he calls \"considerable\r\nactivity\" throughout Luzon, ominously stating that General Young (up\r\nin the Ilocano country, into which we followed him and his cavalry\r\nin Chapter XII, ante) \"has called so emphatically for more force,\"\r\nthat he, MacArthur, feels grave concern; adding that Luzon north of\r\nthe Pasig is \"very much disturbed,\" and that south of the Pasig the\r\nsame conditions prevail. [350]\r\n\r\nOctober 26th, General MacArthur cables outlining a plan for a great\r\ncampaign on comprehensive lines, stating that \"Full development of this\r\nscheme requires about four months and all troops now in the islands,\"\r\nand deprecating any move on Mr. Root's part to reduce his force of\r\n70,000 men by starting any of the volunteers homeward before it should\r\nbe absolutely necessary. [351] October 28th, General MacArthur wires,\r\n\"Shall push everything with great vigor,\" adding \"Expect to have\r\neverything in full operation November 15th.\" [352] November 5th, as\r\nif to reassure General MacArthur that he and the General understand\r\neach other and that the Taft cotemporaneous nonsense is not going to\r\nbe allowed to interfere with more serious business, Secretary Root,\r\nthrough the Adjutant-General, sends this cable message:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Secretary of War directs no instructions from here be allowed\r\n    interfere or impede progress your military operations which he\r\n    expects you force to successful conclusion. [353]\r\n\r\n\r\nSo that while the American people were being pacified with the Taft\r\ncablegrams to Secretary Root that the Filipino people wanted peace,\r\nGeneral MacArthur, under Mr. Root's direction, was simultaneously\r\nproceeding to make them want it with the customary argument used\r\nto settle irreconcilable differences between nations--powder and\r\nlead. Mr. Root was all the time in constant communication with both,\r\nbut he gave out only the Taft optimism to the public, and withheld the\r\nactual facts within his knowledge. December 25th, General MacArthur\r\nwires Secretary Root, \"Expectations based on result of election have\r\nnot been realized.\" \"Progress,\" he says, is \"very slow.\" [354]\r\n\r\nAnd now I come to one of the most important things that all my\r\nresearches into the official records of our government concerning\r\nthe Philippine Islands have developed. On December 28, 1900, General\r\nMacArthur reports by cable the contents of some important insurgent\r\npapers captured in Cavite Province about that time. The Filipinos have\r\na great way of reducing to writing, or making minutes of, whatever\r\noccurs at any important conference. This habit they did not abandon\r\nin the field. The papers in question belonged to General Trias, the\r\nLieutenant-General commanding all the insurgent armies in the field,\r\nand, next to Aguinaldo, the highest official connected with the\r\nrevolutionary government. One of these papers, according to General\r\nMacArthur's despatch of December 28th, purported to be the minutes of\r\na certain meeting had October 11th previous, between General Trias\r\nand the Japanese Consul at Manila. As to whether or not the paper\r\nwas really authentic, General MacArthur says: \"I accept it as such\r\nwithout hesitation.\" Communicating the contents of the paper he says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Consul advised that Trias visit Japan. Filipinos represented that\r\n    concessions which they might be forced to make to Washington would\r\n    be more agreeable if made to Japan, which as a nation of kindred\r\n    blood would not be likely to assert superiority. Consul said Japan\r\n    desired coaling station, freedom to trade and build railways. [355]\r\n\r\n\r\nI consider these negotiations of the Japanese Government with the\r\nPhilippine insurgents important to be related here because they have\r\nnever been generally known, for the good reason, of course, that\r\nthe President of the United States cannot take the public into his\r\nconfidence about such grave and delicate matters when they occur. The\r\nincident is not \"ancient history\" relatively to present-day problems,\r\nfor the following reasons:\r\n\r\n(1) Because it is credibly reported and currently believed in the\r\nUnited States that in Japan, during the cruise of our battleship\r\nfleet around the world in 1907, one of the reception committee of\r\nJapanese officers who welcomed our officers was recognized by one of\r\nthe latter as having been, not a great while before that, a servant\r\naboard an American battleship.\r\n\r\n(2) Because of the following incident, related to me, in 1911,\r\nwithout the slightest injunction of secrecy, by the Director of\r\nPublic Health of the Philippine Islands, then on a visit to the United\r\nStates. Shortly before the Director's said visit home, while he was out\r\nin one of the provinces, there was brought to his attention a Filipino\r\nwith a broken arm. There was a Japanese doctor in the town, at least\r\na Japanese who had a sign out as a doctor. The Director carried the\r\nsufferer to the \"doctor,\" not being a surgeon himself. The \"doctor\"\r\nturned out to be a civil engineer, who had been making maps and plans\r\nof fortifications. The plans were found in his possession.\r\n\r\n(3) Because from one of the islands through which the northern line of\r\nthe Treaty of Paris runs, situated only a pleasant morning's journey\r\nin a launch due north of Aparri, the northernmost town of Luzon, you\r\ncan see, on a clear day, with a good field-glass, the southern end of\r\nFormosa, some 60 or 70 miles away. Japan can land an army on American\r\nsoil at Aparri any time she wants to, overnight--an army several\r\ntimes that of the total American force now in the Philippines, [356]\r\nor likely ever to be there. From Aparri it is 70 miles up the river to\r\nTueguegarao, 40 more to Iligan, and 90 more, all fairly good marching,\r\nto Bayombong, in Nueva Viscaya (total distance, Aparri to Bayombong,\r\n200 miles) the province which lies in the heart of the watershed of\r\nCentral Luzon. I know what I am talking about, because that region\r\nwas the first judicial district I presided over, and many a hard\r\njourney I have had over it, circuit riding, on a scrubby pony. Part\r\nof it I have been through in the company of President Taft. It thus\r\nappears that from Aparri to Bayombong there would be but a week or\r\nten days of unresisted marching to reach the watershed region, Nueva\r\nViscaya. The Japanese soldier's ration is mainly rice, so that he can\r\ncarry more days' travel rations than almost any other soldier in the\r\nworld. Never fear about their making the journey inside of a week or\r\nten days, once they start. To descend from the watershed aforesaid,\r\nover the Caranglan Pass, and down the valley of the Rio Grande de\r\nPampanga to Manila, another three or four days would be all that would\r\nbe needed. It would be a Japanese picnic. Fortifying Corregidor Island,\r\nat the entrance to Manila Bay, which is about all the serious scheme\r\nof defence against a foreign foe we have out there, is quite like\r\nthe reliance of the Spaniards on Morro Castle, at the mouth of the\r\nharbor of Santiago de Cuba, against our landing at Guantanamo. Our\r\ngarrison in the Philippines, all told, is but a handful. Aparri is an\r\nabsolutely unfortified seaport, at which the Japanese could land an\r\narmy overnight from the southern end of Formosa. There are no military\r\nfortifications whatsoever to stay the advance of an invading army\r\nfrom Aparri down the Cagayan Valley, and thence over the watershed\r\nof Nueva Viscaya Province, through the Caranglan Pass, and down the\r\nvalley of the Pampanga River to Manila. So that to-day Japan can\r\ntake Manila inside of two weeks any time she wants to. That is why\r\nI object to the President's \"jollying\" the situation along as best\r\nhe can, without taking the American people into his confidence. Any\r\narmy officer at our War College will inform any member of the House\r\nor Senate on inquiry, that Japan can take the Philippines any time\r\nshe wants to. President Taft and the Mikado may keep on exchanging the\r\nmost cordial cablegrams imaginable, but the map-making goes on just the\r\nsame. And, earnest and sincere as both the President and the Emperor\r\nundoubtedly are in their desire to preserve the general peace, who\r\nis going to restrain Hobson and Hearst, and several of Japan's public\r\nmen equally distinguished and equally inflammatory? Heads of nations\r\ncannot restrain gusts of popular passion. The Pacific Coast is not so\r\nfriendly to Japan as the rest of our country, and as between Japan and\r\nthe Pacific Coast, we are pretty apt to stand by the latter without\r\ninquiring with meticulous nicety into any differences that may arise.\r\n\r\nThe reason I said in the chapter before this one that Mr. Root is\r\na dangerous man to Republican institutions was because he is of the\r\ntype who are constantly finding situations which they consider it best\r\nfor the people not to know about. After the McKinley election of 1900\r\nwas safely \"put over,\" Mr. Root, as Secretary of War, let Judge Taft\r\ngo ahead and ride his dove-of-peace hobby-horse in the Philippines,\r\nduly repeating to the American people all the cheery Taft cluckings\r\nto said horse, at a time when the real situation is indicated by such\r\ngrim correspondence as the following cablegram dated January 29, 1901:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Wood, Havana: Secretary of War is desirous to know if you can\r\n    give your consent to the immediate withdrawal Tenth Infantry\r\n    from Cuba. Imperative that we have immediate use of every\r\n    available company we can lay our hands on for service in the\r\n    Philippines. (Signed) Corbin. [357]\r\n\r\n\r\nBut let us turn from this sorry spectacle of Mr. Root pulling the wool\r\nover the eyes of his countrymen to make them believe the Filipinos\r\nwere not quite so unconsenting as they seemed to be, and again look\r\nat the sheer splendor of American military ability to get anything\r\ndone the Government wants done. I refer to the capture of Aguinaldo.\r\n\r\nOne of the most eminent lawyers in this country once said to me, \"I\r\nwould not let that man Funston enter my house.\" I tried to enlighten\r\nhim, but as I happened to be a guest in his house at the time,\r\nwhich entitled him to exemption from light if he insisted--which he\r\ndid--General Funston and he have continued to miss what might have been\r\na real pleasure to them both. The following is, as briefly as I can\r\ndispose of it, the story of the capture of Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901.\r\n\r\nEver since Aguinaldo had escaped through our lines in November,\r\n1899, his capture had been the one great consummation most devoutly\r\nwished. It has already been shown how busy with the war the army\r\nwas all the time Judge Taft was gayly jogging away astride of his\r\npeace hobby about the insurrection being really quite regretted\r\nand over. However, in the favorite remark with which he used to\r\nwave the insurrection into thin air, to the effect that it was\r\nnow merely \"a Mafia on a large scale,\" there was one element\r\nof truth. The general feeling of the people, both educated and\r\nuneducated, was such as to countenance the attitude of the leaders\r\nthat pro-American tendencies were treason. Any leader who surrendered\r\nof course was thereafter an object of at least some suspicion to his\r\nfellow-countrymen, however assiduous his subsequent double-dealing. As\r\nlong as Aguinaldo remained out, this state of affairs was sure to\r\ncontinue indefinitely, possibly for years to come. If captured, he\r\nwould probably himself give up the struggle, and use his influence\r\nwith the rest to do likewise. Therefore, in the spring of 1901,\r\neach and every one of General MacArthur's 70,000 men was, and had\r\nbeen since 1899, on the qui vive to make his own personal fortunes\r\nsecure for life, and gain lasting military distinction, by taking\r\nany sort of chances to capture Aguinaldo. On February 8, 1901, an\r\nofficer of General Funston's district, the Fourth, in central Luzon,\r\nintercepted a messenger bearing despatches from Aguinaldo to one of\r\nhis generals of that region, directing the general (Lacuna) to send\r\nsome reinforcements to him, Aguinaldo. General Funston's headquarters\r\nwere then at San Fernando, in the province of Pampanga--organized as a\r\n\"civil\" government province by act of the Taft Commission just five\r\ndays later. [358] Through these despatches and their bearer, General\r\nFunston ascertained the hiding-place of the insurgent chieftain to\r\nbe at a place called Palanan, in the mountains of Isabela Province,\r\nin northeastern Luzon, near the Pacific Coast. Early in the war we had\r\navailed ourselves of a certain tribe, or clan, known as the Maccabebes,\r\nwho look nowise different from all other Filipinos, but who had, under\r\nthe Spanish government, by reason of long-standing feuds with their\r\nmore rebellious neighbors, come to be absolutely loyal to the Spanish\r\nauthorities. When we came they had transferred that loyalty to us, and\r\nhad now become a recognized and valuable part of our military force. So\r\nit occurred to General Funston; \"Why not personate the reinforcements\r\ncalled for, the American officers to command the expedition assuming\r\nthe role of captured American prisoners?\" The plan was submitted to\r\nGeneral MacArthur and adopted. A picked company of Maccabebes was\r\nselected, consisting of about eighty men, and General Funston decided\r\nto go himself, taking with him on the perilous expedition four young\r\nofficers of proven mettle: Captain Harry W. Newton, 34th Infantry,\r\nU. S. Volunteers, now a captain of the Coast Artillery; Captain\r\nR. T. Hazzard, 11th Volunteer Cavalry; Lieutenant O. P. M. Hazzard,\r\nhis brother, of the same regiment, the latter now an officer of\r\nthe regular army, and Lieutenant Mitchell, \"my efficient aid.\" [359]\r\nMarch 6, 1901, the U.S.S. Vicksburg slipped quietly out of Manila Bay,\r\nbearing the participants in the desperate enterprise--as desperate\r\nan undertaking as the heart and brain of a soldier ever carried to a\r\nsuccessful conclusion. General Thomas H. Barry wrote Secretary of War\r\nRoot, after they left, telling of their departure, and stating that\r\nhe did not much expect ever to see them again. The chances were ten\r\nto one that the eighty men would meet five or ten times their number,\r\nand, as they were to masquerade as troops of the enemy, they could\r\nnot complain, under the recognized laws of war as to spies, at being\r\nsummarily shot if captured alive. And the whole Filipino people were a\r\nsecret service ready to warn Aguinaldo, should the carefully concocted\r\nruse be discovered anywhere along the journey. They went down to the\r\nsouthern end of Luzon, and through the San Bernardino Straits into\r\nthe Pacific Ocean, and thence up the east coast of Luzon to Casiguran\r\nBay, about 100 miles south of Palanan, landing at Casiguran Bay, March\r\n14th. The \"little Macks,\" as General Funston calls the Maccabebes, were\r\nmade to discard their dapper American uniforms after they got aboard\r\nthe ship, and don instead a lot of nondescript clothing gathered by\r\nthe military authorities at Manila before the Vicksburg sailed, so\r\nas to resemble the average insurgent command. Not a man of them had\r\nbeen told of the nature of the expedition before sailing. This was\r\nnot for fear of treachery, but lest some one of the faithful \"Macks\"\r\nshould get his tongue loosed by hospitality before departing. Also,\r\ntheir Krag-Jorgensen regulation rifles were taken from them, and a\r\nmiscellaneous assortment of old Springfields, Mausers, etc., given them\r\ninstead, to complete the deception. An ex-insurgent officer, well known\r\nto Aguinaldo, but now in General Funston's employ, was to play the\r\nrole of commanding officer of the \"reinforcements.\" To read General\r\nFunston's account of this expedition is a more convincing rebuttal\r\nof the contemporaneous Taft denials of Filipino hostility and of the\r\nunanimity of the feeling of the people against us, than a thousand\r\nquotations from official documents could ever be. It was necessary\r\nto land more than 100 miles south of Aguinaldo's hiding-place, lest\r\nthe smoke of the approaching vessel should be sighted from a distance,\r\nand some peasant or lookout give the alarm. Accordingly, they landed at\r\nCasiguran Bay by night, with the ship's lights screened, the Vicksburg\r\nat once departing out of sight of land, and agreeing to meet them off\r\nPalanan, their destination, on March 25th, eleven days later. From the\r\nbeginning they vigilantly and consummately played the role planned,\r\nthe \"Macks\" having been drilled on the way up, each and all, in the\r\nstory they were to tell at the first village near Casiguran Bay, and\r\neverywhere thereafter, to the effect that they had come across country,\r\nand en route had met ten American soldiers out map-making, and had\r\nkilled two, wounded three, and captured five. They were to point to\r\nGeneral Funston and the four other Americans in corroboration of their\r\nstory. Speaking of himself and his four fellow \"prisoners,\" General\r\nFunston says, \"We were a pretty scrubby looking lot of privates.\" The\r\nvillagers received the patriot forces, thus flushed with triumph,\r\nin an appropriate manner, and supplied them with rations and guides\r\nfor the rest of their 100-mile journey to the headquarters of the\r\n\"dictator.\" General Funston is even at pains to say for the village\r\nofficials that they were very humane and courteous to himself and\r\nthe other four American \"prisoners.\" They reached Palanan Bay,\r\neight miles from Palanan, on March 22d. Here Hilario Tal Placido,\r\nthe ex-insurgent officer whose role in the present thrilling drama\r\nwas that of \"commanding officer\" of the expedition, sent a note to\r\nAguinaldo, stating that he had halted his command for a rest at the\r\nbeach preparatory to marching inland and reporting to the Honorable\r\nPresidente, that they were very much exhausted, and much in need of\r\nfood, and please to send him some. Of course that was the natural card\r\nto play to put Aguinaldo off his guard. The food came, and the bearers\r\nreturned and casually reported to the Honorable Presidente that his\r\nhonorable reinforcements would soon be along, much to the honorable\r\njoy--to make the thing a little Japanesque--of the president of the\r\nhonorable republic. This incident has been since made the occasion of\r\nsome criticism--that it was contrary to decency to accept Aguinaldo's\r\nfood and then attack him afterwards. General Funston very properly\r\nreplies in effect that the case would have been very different had he\r\nthrown himself on Aguinaldo's mercy, taken his food, and used treachery\r\nafterwards, but that his conduct was entirely correct, under the code\r\nof war, for the reason that should he and his command be captured\r\nwhile personating enemy's forces, Aguinaldo would have had a perfect\r\nright, under the rules of the game, to shoot them all as spies. He\r\nadds rather savagely, concerning \"certain ladylike persons in the\r\nUnited States\" who have censured his course in the matter, that he\r\n\"would be very much interested in seeing the results of a surgical\r\noperation performed on the skull of a man who cannot readily see the\r\nradical difference between the two propositions,\" and that he doubts\r\nif a good quality of calf brains would be revealed by the operation.\r\n\r\nAt all events, the expedition was very much refreshed by the food\r\nand highly delighted at the proof, contained in the sending of it,\r\nthat Aguinaldo did not suspect a ruse. But now came one of the many\r\nemergencies which had to be met by quick wit in the course of that\r\nmemorable adventure. Aguinaldo sent word to leave the \"prisoners\"\r\nunder a guard in one of the huts by the sea-shore, where there was one\r\nof the Aguinaldo retainers in charge, an old Tagalo. After a hurried,\r\nwhispered conversation, \"prisoner\" Funston instructed \"Commanding\r\nOfficer\" Placido to go ahead with his main column and then a little\r\nlater send back a forged written order purporting to be from Aguinaldo,\r\nfor the \"prisoners\" to come on also. This was shown to the old Tagalo,\r\nthus disarming suspicion on his part. But now came the \"closest shave\"\r\nthey had. The column met a detachment from Aguinaldo's headquarters\r\nsent down with instructions to relieve the necessarily worn-out\r\nguard of the newly arrived \"re-inforcements\" that were supposed to\r\nbe guarding the five prisoners at the beach, and let said guard come\r\non up to headquarters with the rest of the \"re-inforcements,\" the\r\nidea being to still leave the prisoners at the beach so they would\r\nnot learn definitely as to the Aguinaldo whereabouts. Detaining the\r\nofficer commanding this detachment for a moment or so on some pretext,\r\nthe \"Commanding Officer\" of the \"re-inforcements\" whispered to a\r\nMaccabebe corporal to run back and tell General Funston and the rest\r\nof the \"prisoners\" to jump in the bushes and hide. This they did,\r\nlying within thirty feet of the detachment, as it passed them en\r\nroute for the beach. Of course a fight would have meant considerable\r\nfiring, and the quarry might hear it, take fright, and escape. Finally\r\nthey reached Palanan, the \"prisoners\" quite far in the rear. Placido\r\ngot safely into Aguinaldo's presence, followed at a short distance\r\nby the main body of his Maccabebes. Aguinaldo's life-guard of some\r\nfifty men, neatly uniformed, presented arms as Placido entered the\r\ninsurgent headquarters building, and thereafter waited at attention\r\noutside. Then the worthy Placido entertained the honorable Presidente\r\nwith a few cock-and-bull stories about the march across country,\r\netc., made obediently to the President's order, keeping a weather\r\neye out of the window all the time. As soon as the Maccabebes had\r\ncome up and formed facing the Aguinaldo life-guard, Placido went to\r\nthe window and ordered them to open fire. This they did, killing\r\ntwo of the insurgents and wounding their commanding officer. The\r\nrest fled, panic-stricken, by reason of the surprise. Then Placido,\r\na very stout individual, grabbed Aguinaldo, who only weighs about\r\n115 pounds, threw him down, and sat on him, until General Funston,\r\nthe Hazzards, Mitchell, and Newton arrived. The orders were iron-clad\r\nthat under no circumstances, if it could be avoided, was Aguinaldo\r\nto be killed. His signature to proclamations telling the people to\r\nquit the war was going to be needed too much. The party rested two\r\ndays and then set out for the coast again, on March 25th, the day the\r\nVicksburg had agreed to meet them. \"At noon\" says General Funston,\r\n\"we again saw the Pacific, and far out on it a wisp of smoke--the\r\nVicksburg coming in!\" In due course they reached Manila Bay. The\r\nold palace of the Spanish captains-general, then occupied by our\r\ncommanding general, is up the Pasig River, accessible from the bay\r\nby launch. By that method General Funston took his precious prisoner\r\nto the palace without the knowledge of a soul in the great city of\r\nManila. He arrived before General MacArthur had gotten up. In a few\r\nminutes the General came out. \"Where is Aguinaldo?\" said he, dryly. He\r\nsupposed General Funston simply had some details to tell, like the\r\ncommanding officers of hundreds of other expeditions that had gone out\r\nbefore that on false scents in search of the illustrious but elusive\r\nPresidente. \"Right here in this house,\" said General Funston. General\r\nMacArthur could hardly believe his ears. A few days later, General\r\nFunston walked into General MacArthur's office. The latter said;\r\n\"Well, Funston, they do not seem to have thought much in Washington\r\nof your performance. I am afraid you have got into trouble.\" \"At the\r\nsame time he handed me,\" says General Funston in the Scribner Magazine\r\narticle above mentioned, \"a cablegram announcing my appointment as\r\na brigadier-general in the regular army.\"\r\n\r\nIn his annual report for 1901, [360] General MacArthur describes\r\nthe capture of Aguinaldo as \"the most momentous single event of\r\nthe year,\" stating also that \"Aguinaldo was the incarnation of the\r\ninsurrection.\" This last statement explains why he was so anxious to\r\ncapture him alive. If dead, he would be sure to get re-incarnated in\r\nthe person of some able assistant of his entourage, thus insuring\r\nundisturbed continuance of the war. He was most graciously treated\r\nby General MacArthur during his stay as that distinguished soldier's\r\n\"guest\" at the Malacanan palace, from March 28th until April 20th. The\r\nword \"guest\" is placed in quotations because the host thought so\r\nmuch of him that he considered him worth many hundred times his\r\nweight in gold, and had him watched night and day by a commissioned\r\nofficer. Everything that had been done by the Americans since November,\r\n1899, was explained to him, and he was made to see that our purposes\r\nwith regard to his people were not only benevolent but also inflexible;\r\nin other words that there was no altering our determination to make\r\nhis people happy whether they were willing or not. Seeing this,\r\nAguinaldo bowed to the inevitable. The programme explained to\r\nAguinaldo is wittily described by a very bright Englishwoman as a\r\nplan \"to have lots of American school teachers at once set to work\r\nto teach the Filipino English and at the same time keep plenty of\r\nAmerican soldiers around to knock him on the head should he get a\r\nnotion that he is ready for self-government before the Americans\r\nthink he is\"--a quaint scheme, she adds, \"and one characteristic of\r\nthe dauntlessness of American energy.\" To be brief, on April 19th,\r\nAguinaldo took the oath of allegiance to the American Government,\r\nwhich all agree he has faithfully observed ever since, and issued\r\na proclamation recommending abandonment of further resistance. This\r\nproclamation was at once published by General MacArthur and signalized\r\nby the immediate liberation of one thousand prisoners of war, on\r\ntheir likewise taking the oath of allegiance.  In his proclamation\r\nAguinaldo said, among other things:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The time has come, however, when they [the Filipino people] find\r\n    their advance along this path [the path of their aspirations]\r\n    impeded by an irresistible force. * * * Enough of blood, enough\r\n    of tears and desolation.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe concludes by announcing his final unconditional submission to\r\nAmerican sovereignty and advises others to do likewise. [361]\r\n\r\nSoon after this General Tino surrendered in General Young's district,\r\nand in another part of northern Luzon, General Mascardo, commanding\r\nthe insurgent forces in the provinces of Bataan and Zambales,\r\nheretofore described as \"the west wing of the great central plain,\"\r\nalso surrendered. In the latter part of June, General Cailles, with\r\nwhom we have already had occasion to become acquainted, in connection\r\nwith Judge Taft's \"Mafia on a large scale,\" also surrendered in\r\nLaguna Province. After that, there was never any more trouble in\r\nnorthern Luzon. But during the spring of 1901, the Commission had\r\nbeen very busy organizing the provinces of southern Luzon under\r\ncivil government, thus cutting short the process of licking it into\r\nsubmission and substituting a process of loving it into that state\r\nthrough good salaries and otherwise--a policy which postponed the\r\nfinal permanent pacification of that ill-fated region for several\r\nyears, as hereinafter more fully set forth.\r\n\r\nThe unconditional absoluteness with which Judge Taft acted from the\r\nbeginning on the assumption that the Filipinos would make a distinction\r\nbetween civil and military rule, and that their objection to us was\r\nbecause we had first sent soldiers to rule them and not civilians,\r\nand that these objections would vanish before the benignant sunlight\r\nof a government by civilians, is one of the great tragedies of all\r\nhistory, considering the countless lives it eventually cost. As a\r\nmatter of fact, the Filipino objection had little or no relation\r\nto the kind of clothes we wore, whether they were white duck or\r\nkhaki. Their objection was to us, i.e., to an alien yoke. However,\r\nto heal the bleeding wounds of war, the Filipinos were benevolently\r\ntold to forget it, and a civil government was set up on July 4, 1901,\r\npursuant to the amiable delusion indicated. That it has never yet\r\nproved a panacea, and why, will be developed in the next and subsequent\r\nchapters, but only in-so-far as such development throws light on the\r\npresent situation--which it is the whole object of this book to do.\r\n\r\nAnd now a few words by way of concluding the present chapter, as\r\npreliminary to the inauguration of a civil government, cannot be\r\nmisconstrued, though they come from one who held office under it. I\r\nhave certainly made clear that Judge Taft and his colleagues were as\r\nhonest in their delusion about how popular they were with the Filipinos\r\nas many other public men who have been known to have hobbies, and my\r\nremarks must be understood as based on the comprehensive bird's-eye\r\nview which we have had of the whole situation from the outbreak of\r\nthe war with Spain in 1898 to the end of June, 1901, as a summation\r\nof that situation. It is quite true that all contemporary history is\r\nas much affected by its environment as the writer of it is by his\r\nown limitations. But it certainly seems clear now that, in regard\r\nto the Philippine problem presented in 1898 by the decision to keep\r\nthe islands, the American people were played upon by the politicians\r\nfor the next few years thereafter, sometimes on the idea that the\r\nFilipino people were not a people but only a jumble of semi-civilized\r\ntribes incapable of any intelligent notion of what independence meant,\r\nand sometimes on the idea that while there was no denying that they\r\nwere indeed a civilized, homogeneous, Christian people, yet the great\r\nmajority of them did not want independence, and would prefer to be\r\nunder a strong alien government. But the key-note to the McKinley\r\npolicy from the beginning, his answer to the eager question of his\r\nown people, was that there was no real absence of the consent of the\r\ngoverned. In Senator Lodge's history of the war with Spain, written in\r\n1899, there is a description of the long struggle for independence in\r\nCuba, whose existence Spain denied year after year until we decided\r\nthat patience had ceased to be a virtue, which description is so\r\nstrikingly applicable to the situation in the Philippines during\r\nthe first years of American rule that I cannot refrain from quoting\r\nit here:\r\n\r\n\r\n    And we were to go on pretending that the war was not there,\r\n    and that we had answered the unsettled question, when we really\r\n    had simply turned our heads aside and refused to look. And then\r\n    when the troublesome matter had been so nicely laid to sleep,\r\n    the result followed which is usual when Congressmen and Presidents\r\n    and nations are trying to make shams pass for realities.\" [362]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the same high token the Philippine question will always remain\r\n\"the unsettled question\" until it is settled right. In other words,\r\nthe American occupation of the Philippines, having been originally\r\npredicated on the idea that the Filipino people did not really\r\nwant independence, a fiction which political expediency incident\r\nto government by parties inexorably compelled it to try to live up\r\nto thereafter, took the form, in 1901, of a civil government founded\r\nupon a benevolent lie, which expressed a hope, not a fact, a hopeless\r\nhope that can never be a fact. And that is what has been the matter\r\nwith it ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    The papers 'id it 'andsome,\r\n                    But you bet the army knows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR TAFT--1901-2\r\n\r\n                For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of\r\n                my people slightly, saying--Peace, peace; when there\r\n                is no peace. Jeremiah viii., 11.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 1898, the American Consul at Manila, Mr. Williams,\r\nafter he had been at that post for about a month, wrote the State\r\nDepartment, describing the Spanish methods of keeping from the world\r\nthe outward and visible manifestations of the desire of the Filipino\r\npeople to be free from their yoke thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Peace was proclaimed and, since my coming, festivities therefor\r\n    were held; but there is no peace, and has been none for two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Conditions here and in Cuba are practically alike. War exists,\r\n    battles are of almost daily occurrence, etc. [363]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs will hereinafter appear, this is not far from a correct description\r\nof the conditions which prevailed successively in various provinces\r\nof the Philippines in gradually lessening degree for the six years\r\nnext ensuing after the report of the Taft Commission of November 30,\r\n1900, wherein they said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A great majority of the people long for peace and are entirely\r\n    willing to accept the establishment of a government under the\r\n    supremacy of the United States. [364]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how from the date of the outbreak, February 4, 1899, to\r\nthe date of his final departure from the islands for the United States\r\non May 5, 1900, General Otis had diligently supplied the eager ear of\r\nMr. McKinley with his \"situation well in hand\" and \"insurrection about\r\nto collapse\" telegrams, Secretary of War Alger having meantime been\r\nforced out of the cabinet--in part, at least--by a public opinion which\r\nindignantly believed that the real situation was being withheld. We\r\nhave seen how, from soon after the arrival of the Taft Commission at\r\nManila on June 3, 1900, until after the November elections of that\r\nyear, the same eager presidential ear aforesaid was supplied with\r\nlike material through the presumably innocent but opportunely deluded\r\noptimism of the Commission, as manifested in the above sample message;\r\nhow the actual military situation as described by General MacArthur,\r\nthe military commander at the time, was one of \"desperate resistance by\r\nmeans of a general banding of the people in support of the guerrillas\r\nin the field,\" [365] he having wired the War Department on January 4,\r\n1901, \"Troops throughout the archipelago more active than at any time\r\nsince November, 1899\"; [366] and how this had been followed on July\r\n4, 1901, by a civil government, the inauguration of which could by\r\nno possibility be construed as affirming to the people of the United\r\nStates anything other than the existence of a state of peace.\r\n\r\nWe are to trace in this and subsequent chapters how, a short time after\r\nthe civil government was instituted, the insurrection got its second\r\nwind; how a year later came another public declaration of peace, on\r\nJuly 4, 1902; and how this was followed by a long series of public\r\ndisorders, combated by prosecutions for sedition and brigandage,\r\nuntil toward the end of 1906. The drama is quite an allegory--Uncle\r\nSam wrestling with his guardian angel Consent-of-the-governed. He\r\nfinally gets both the angel's shoulders on the mat, however, and so\r\nthe two have lived at loggerheads in the Philippines ever since.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we had once blundered into the colonial business, the\r\nrock-bottom frankness with which we so dearly love to deal with one\r\nanother, let carping Europe deny it as she will, was superseded\r\nby a systematic effort on the part of the statesmen responsible\r\nfor the blunder to conceal it. It soon became clear to those on the\r\ninside that the sovereign American people had \"bought a gold brick,\"\r\nthat is to say, had made a grievous mistake and had done wrong. But\r\nas it is not expedient for courtiers to tell the sovereign he has\r\ndone wrong, because \"The king can do no wrong,\" thereafter all the\r\ncourtiers,--i. e. persons desiring to control the \"sovereign\" while\r\nseeming to obey him--instead of risking loss of the \"royal\" favor\r\nby boldly telling the people they had done wrong and ought to mend\r\nthe error of their ways, began to fill their ears and salve their\r\nconscience with mediaeval doctrines about salvation of the heathen\r\nthrough governmental missions maintained by the joint agencies of Cross\r\nand Sword. For the foregoing and cognate reasons, Senator Lodge's\r\ndescription of Spain's last thirty years in Cuba fits our first six\r\nor seven in the Philippines, beginning in 1899 with the original\r\nOtis press censorship policy of \"not letting anything go that will\r\nhurt the Administration,\" and coming on down to a certificate made\r\nin 1907 by the Philippine Commission for consumption in the United\r\nStates, to the effect that a state of general and complete peace had\r\nprevailed throughout the islands for a stated period preceding the\r\ncertificate, when, as a matter of fact, during the period covered by\r\nthe certificate, an executive proclamation formally declaring a state\r\nof insurrection had issued, and the Supreme Court of the islands had\r\nupheld certain drastic executive action as legal because of the state\r\nof insurrection recognized by the proclamation.\r\n\r\nThe Taft civil government of the Philippines set up in 1901 was an\r\nattempt to answer the question which, during the crucial period of\r\nour country's history following the Spanish War, rang so persistently\r\nthrough the public utterances of both Grover Cleveland and Benjamin\r\nHarrison: \"Mr. President, how are you going to square the subjugation\r\nof the Philippines with the freeing of Cuba?\" Mr. McKinley's\r\nanswer had been, in effect: \"Never mind about that, Grover; you and\r\nBenjamin are back numbers. I will show you 'the latest thing' in the\r\nconsent-of-the-governed line, a government not 'essentially popular,'\r\nit is true, nor indeed at all 'popular,' in fact very unpopular,\r\nbut 'essentially popular in form.' You lads are not experts on the\r\npolitical trapeze.\" Accordingly, as Senator Lodge said concerning\r\nthe dreary years of continuous public disorders in Cuba under Spain,\r\nwhich we finally put a stop to in 1898:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We were to go on pretending that the war was not there, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLack of frankness is usually due to weakness of one sort or\r\nanother. The weakness of the Spanish colonial system lay in the\r\nimpotent poverty of the home government and the graft tendencies\r\nof the colonial officials. The weakness of the American colonial\r\nsystem has always lain in the fundamental unfitness of republican\r\ngovernmental machinery for boldly advocating and honestly enforcing\r\ndoctrines which deny frankly and as a matter of course that governments\r\nderive their just powers from the consent of the governed. There\r\nare so many people in a republic like ours who will always stand by\r\nthis last proposition as righteous, and as being the chief bulwark\r\nof their own liberties, and so many who will always regard denial\r\nof that proposition as an insidious practice calculated ultimately\r\nto react on their own institutions, that no colonial government of\r\nconquered subject provinces eager for independence can ever have the\r\nsympathy and backing of all our people. Thus it is that to get home\r\nsupport for the policy, the supreme need of the colonial government\r\nis constant apology for its own existence, and constant effort to\r\nshow that the subject people do not really want freedom to pursue\r\nhappiness in their own way as badly as their orators say they do;\r\nthat the oratory is mere \"hot air\"; and that the people really like\r\nalien domination better than they seem to.\r\n\r\nAlways in a mental attitude of self-defence against home criticism,\r\nin its official reports there is ever present with the Philippine\r\ninsular government the tendency and temptation not to volunteer to\r\nthe American people evidence within its possession calculated to\r\nawaken discussion as to the wisdom of its continuance. It thus usurps\r\na legitimate function never intended to be delegated to the Executive,\r\nbut reserved to the people. It thus makes itself the judge of how much\r\nthe people at home shall know. The law of self-preservation prompts\r\nit not to take the American people into its confidence, at least\r\nnot that portion of them who are opposed on principle to holding\r\nremote colonies impossible to defend in the event of war without a\r\nlarge standing army maintained for the purpose. There is always the\r\napprehension that the value of apparently unfavorable evidence will\r\nnot be wisely weighed by the people at home, because of unfamiliarity\r\nwith insular conditions. This is by no means altogether vicious. It\r\nis a perfectly natural attitude and a good deal can be said in favor\r\nof it. But the real vice of it lies in the fact that your colonial\r\ngovernment thus becomes not unlike the president of a certain naval\r\nboard before which a case involving the commission of an officer of\r\nthe navy was once tried. They had no competent official stenographer to\r\ntake down all that transpired. The Navy Department was asked for one,\r\nbut they referred it to the board. The president of the board knew very\r\nwell that \"the defence\" wanted to show bias on his part. He exuded\r\nconscious rectitude and plainly resented any suggestion of bias. So\r\na stenographer was refused and the case proceeded, the proceedings\r\nbeing recorded in long hand by a regular permanent employee of the\r\nboard. Under such circumstances, there is so much which transpires that\r\nis absolutely irrelevant and immaterial, that the proceedings would\r\nbe interminable if every little thing were recorded. Consequently,\r\nmuch that was material, including casual remarks of the president of\r\nthe board clearly indicative of bias sufficient to disqualify any\r\njudge or juror on earth, failed of entry in the record. However,\r\nenough was gotten into the record to satisfy the President of the\r\nUnited States that the president of the board was not only not\r\nimpartial, but very much prejudiced, and he reversed the action of\r\nthe board. The case of that board is very much like the case of the\r\nPhilippine Government. The case of the latter is, as it were, a case\r\ninvolving a question as to how long a guardianship ought to continue,\r\nand they simply fail and omit to have recorded in a form where it may\r\nbe available to the reviewing authority, the American people, much that\r\nis material (on the idea of saving the reviewing authority labor and\r\ntrouble), which they think the record ought not to be cumbered with,\r\nor the reviewing authority bothered with. This practice is due to a\r\nconfident belief that the American people, being so far away, and being\r\nnecessarily so wholly unacquainted with all the ins and outs of the\r\nsituation in the Philippines, are not fitted to pass intelligently on\r\nthe questions which continually confront the colonial government. This\r\nis not a mental attitude of insult to the intelligence of the people\r\nof the United States. It is simply a belief that they, the colonial\r\nofficials, know much better than the American people can ever know,\r\nwhat is wisest, in each case, to be done in the premises. And there\r\nis much to be said in favor of this view, so far as details go. The\r\nfundamental error of it, however, lies in the assumption that the\r\nAmerican people are forever committed to permanent retention of the\r\nPhilippines, i. e., permanent so far as any living human being is\r\nconcerned--an assumption wholly unauthorized by any declaration of\r\nthe law-making power of this government, and countenanced only by\r\nthe oft-expressed hope of President Taft that that will be the policy\r\nsome day declared, if any definite policy is ever declared. Thus it\r\nis that throughout the last twelve years those particular facts and\r\nevents which (to me) seem most vitally relevant to the fundamental\r\nquestion in the case, viz., whether or not we should continue to\r\npersist in the original blunder of inaugurating and maintaining a--to\r\nall intents and purposes--permanent over-seas colonial government,\r\nhave been withheld from the knowledge of the American public. The\r\npresent policy of indefinite retention with undeclared intention\r\nis a mere makeshift to avoid a frank avowal of intention to retain\r\nthe islands for all future time with which anybody living has any\r\npractical concern. Until it is substituted by a definite declaration\r\nby Congress similar to the one we made in the case of Cuba, and the\r\npresent American Governor-General and his associates are substituted\r\nby men sent out to report back how soon they think the Filipinos\r\nmay safely be trusted to attend to their own domestic concerns, all\r\ncrucial facts and situations that might jeopardize the continuance\r\nof the present American regime in the Philippines will continue,\r\nas heretofore, to remain unmentioned in the official reports of the\r\nAmerican authorities now out there. Until that is done, you will never\r\nhear the Filipino side of the case from anybody whose opinion you are\r\nwilling to make the basis of governmental action. These remarks will,\r\nobviously from the nature of the case, be quite as true long after\r\nPresident Taft, the reader, and I are dead as they are now.\r\n\r\nMr. Taft would be very glad to have Congress declare frankly that it\r\nis the purpose of this Government to hold the Philippines permanently,\r\ni. e., permanently so far as the word means continuance of the \"uplift\"\r\ntreatment long after everybody now on the earth is beneath it. But\r\nbecause public opinion in the United States is so much divided as\r\nto the wisdom of a policy of frankly avowed intention permanently\r\nto retain the islands, he prefers to leave the whole matter open\r\nand undetermined, so as to get the support both of those who think\r\na definite programme of permanent retention righteous and those who\r\nthink such a programme vicious. He wishes to please both sides of\r\na moral issue, on the idea that, as the present policy is in his\r\nindividual judgment best for all concerned, the end justifies the\r\nmeans. Yet, as the issue is a moral one, which concerns the cause of\r\nrepresentative government throughout the world, and a strategic one\r\nwhich concerns the national defence, it should, in my judgment, no\r\nlonger be dodged, but squarely met. You constantly hear President Taft\r\ntalking quite out loud here at home, in his public utterances, about\r\nthe great politico-missionary work we are doing in the Philippines\r\nby furnishing them with the most approved up-to-date methods for\r\nthe pursuit of happiness, the avoidance of graft in government, the\r\nelimination of crimes of violence, in short the ideal way to minimize\r\nthe ills that human governments are heir to, while every day and every\r\ndollar spent out there by Americans induced by him to go there, are\r\ntime and money tensely arrayed against the ultimate independence he\r\npurports to favor. Give the Americans out there a square deal. Let\r\nthem know whether we are going to keep the islands or whether we\r\nare not. Honesty is a far better policy than the present policy. The\r\nAmericans in the islands, Mr. Taft's agents in the Philippines, talk no\r\nuncandid and misleading stuff about the Philippines being exclusively\r\nfor the Filipinos. And they do considerable talking. They need looking\r\nafter, if the present pious fiction is to be kept up at this end of the\r\nline. Nobody in the Philippines to-day, among the Americans, considers\r\ntalk about independence as anything other than political buncombe very\r\nhampering to their work. Listen to this high official of the insular\r\ngovernment, who writes in the North American Review for February, 1912:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The somewhat blatant note with which we at the beginning\r\n    proclaimed our altruistic purposes in the Philippines has died\r\n    away into a whisper. To say much about it is to incur a charge\r\n    of hypocrisy. [367]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important problem which confronted Mr. McKinley when he\r\nsent Judge Taft to the Philippines was how to so handle the supreme\r\nquestion of public order as to avoid any necessity of having to\r\nask Congress later for more volunteers to replace those whose terms\r\nof enlistment would expire June 30, 1901. We have already reviewed\r\nthe strenuous efforts of General MacArthur during the twelve months\r\nimmediately following the arrival of the Taft Commission in June,\r\n1900, to get rid of the shadow of this necessity by the date named,\r\nthe regular army having been reorganized meantime and considerably\r\nincreased by the Act of February 2, 1901. On March 22, 1901, while\r\nthe Taft Commission was going around the islands with their Federal\r\nparty folk, holding out the prospect of office to those who would\r\nquit insurging and come in and be good, General MacArthur reported\r\nprogress to Secretary of War Root by cable as follows: \"Hope report\r\ncessation of hostilities before June 30.\" [368] His idea was to get\r\na good military grip on the situation, if possible, by that time,\r\nand, as a corollary, of course, that the grip thus obtained should\r\nbe diligently retained for a long time, not loosened, so that the\r\ndisturbed conditions incident to many years of war might have a few\r\nyears, at least, in which to settle. In his annual report dated July 4,\r\n1901, the date of the inauguration of Judge Taft as \"Civil Governor,\"\r\nhe says, in regard to the imperative necessity for continuing the\r\nmilitary grip by keeping on hand sufficient forces:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Anything in the immediate future calculated to impede the activity\r\n    or reduce the efficiency of these instruments will not only be a\r\n    menace to the present, but put in jeopardy the entire future of\r\n    American possibilities in the archipelago. [369]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral MacArthur believed in keeping the islands permanently. His\r\nviews were frankly imperialistic. He had no salve to offer to the\r\nconscience of pious thrift at home anxious to believe that the\r\nFilipinos were not bitterly opposed to our rule, and very much in\r\nfavor of what was supposed to be a glittering opening for Trade\r\nExpansion. He was thoroughly imbued with the British colonial idea\r\nknown as The White Man's Burden. On the other hand, Governor Taft\r\nfirmly believed that kindness would cure the desire of the people for\r\nindependence. The difference between these two gentlemen was fully\r\nventilated afterward before the Senate Committee of 1902. A statement\r\nof General MacArthur's embodying the crux of this difference was read\r\nto Governor Taft by Senator Carmack, and the Governor's reply was:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We did not then agree with that statement, and we do not now\r\n    agree with it. [370]\r\n\r\n\r\nA little later, in the same connection, he said to the same Senate\r\nCommittee, with the cheery tolerance of conflicting views which comes\r\nonly from entire confidence in the soundness of one's own:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I have been called the Mark Tapley of this Philippine business.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt about the fact that President Taft is an\r\noptimist. But while optimism is a very blessed thing in a sick-room or\r\na financial panic, it is a very poor substitute for powder and lead\r\nin putting down an insurrection, or in weaning people from a desire\r\nfor independence accentuated by a long war waged for that purpose,\r\nespecially when your kindness must be accompanied by assurances to\r\nthe objects of it that on account of a lack of sufficient intelligence\r\nthey are not fit for the thing they want. It was upon a programme of\r\nthis sort that Governor Taft entered upon the task of reconciling the\r\nFilipinos to American rule more than ten years ago. The impossibility\r\nof the task is of course obvious enough from the mere statement of\r\nit. The subsequent bitterness between him and the military authorities\r\nwas quite carefully and very properly kept from the American public\r\nbecause it might get back to the Filipino public. The military folk\r\nknew that to go around the country setting up provincial and municipal\r\ngovernments, carrying a liberal pay-roll, with diligent contemporaneous\r\ncirculation of the knowledge that anybody who would quit fighting\r\nwould stand a good chance to get an office, would seem to many of the\r\nFilipinos a confession of weakness and fear, sure to cause trouble\r\nlater. Many of them--of course it would be inappropriate to mention\r\nnames--simply did not believe that Mr. Taft was honest in his absurd\r\nnotion. They simply damned \"politics\" for meddling with war, and let\r\nit go at that. But the real epic pathos of the whole thing was that\r\nMr. Taft was actually sincere. He believed that the majority of the\r\nPhilippine people were for him and his policies. As late as 1905,\r\nhe seems to have clung to this idea, according to various accounts\r\nby Senators Newlands, Dubois, and others, in magazine articles\r\nwritten after their return from a trip to the Philippines in that\r\nyear in company with Mr. Taft, then Secretary of War. In fact so\r\nimpressed were they with the general discontent out there, and yet so\r\nconsiderate of their good friend Mr. Taft's feelings in the matter and\r\nhis confidence that the Filipinos loved benevolent alien domination,\r\nthat one of them simply contented himself with the remark:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When we left the islands I do not believe there was a single\r\n    member of our party who was not sorry we own them, except Secretary\r\n    Taft himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndeed it is not until 1907 that, we find Mr. Taft's paternal\r\nsolicitude for his step-daughter, Miss Filipina, finally reconciling\r\nitself to the idea that while this generation seems to want Home\r\nRule as irreconcilably as Ireland herself and \"wont be happy 'til\r\nit gets it,\" yet inasmuch as Home Rule is not, in his judgment, good\r\nfor every people, this generation is therefore a wicked and perverse\r\ngeneration, and hence the Filipinos must simply resign themselves to\r\nthe idea of being happy in some other generation. This attitude was\r\nfreely stated before the Millers' convention at St. Louis, May 30,\r\n1907, the speech being reported in the St. Louis Globe-Democrat the\r\nnext day. Said Mr. Taft on that occasion, after admitting that the\r\nIslands had been a tremendous financial drain on us:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If, then, we have not had material recompense, have we had it in\r\n    the continuing gratitude of the people whom we have aided?\r\n\r\n\r\nAnswering this, in effect, though not in so many words, \"Alas, no,\"\r\nhe adds, with a sigh which is audible between the lines:\r\n\r\n\r\n    He who would measure his altruism by the thankfulness of those\r\n    whom he aids, will not persist in good works.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus we see the Mark Tapley optimism of 1902 become in 1907 a species\r\nof solicitude which Dickens describes in Bleak House as \"Telescopic\r\nPhilanthropy,\" in the chapter by that title in which he introduces\r\nthe famous Mrs. Jellyby, mother of a large and interesting family,\r\n\"a lady of very remarkable strength of character, who devotes\r\nherself entirely to the public,\" who \"has devoted herself to an\r\nextensive variety of public subjects, at various times, and is at\r\npresent devoted to the subject of Africa, with a general view to the\r\ncultivation of the coffee berry--and the natives,\"--to the woeful\r\nneglect of her own domestic concerns and her large and expensive\r\nfamily of children. Since 1907, Mr. Taft has frankly abandoned his\r\nearly delusion about the consent-of-the-governed, and boldly takes\r\nthe position, up to that time more or less evaded, that the consent\r\nof the governed is not at all essential to just government.\r\n\r\nThe apotheosis of Uncle Sam as Mrs. Jellyby is to be found in one of\r\nMr. Taft's speeches wherein he declared that the present Philippine\r\npolicy was \"a plan for the spread of Christian civilization in the\r\nOrient.\"\r\n\r\nThus has it been that, under the reactionary influence of a colonial\r\npolicy, this republic has followed its frank abandonment of the idea\r\nthat all just government must derive its origin in the consent of\r\nthe governed by a further abandonment of the idea that Church and\r\nState should be kept separate. I do not wish to make President Taft\r\nridiculous, and could not if I would. Nor do I seek to belittle him\r\nin the eyes of his people,--for we are \"his people,\" for the time\r\nbeing. No one can belittle him. He is too big a man to be belittled\r\nby anybody. Besides, he is, in many respects beyond all question, a\r\ntruly great man. But he is not the only great man in history who has\r\nmade egregious blunders. And there is no question that we are running\r\nthere on the confines of Asia, in the Philippines, a superfluous\r\ngovernmental kindergarten whose sessions should be concluded, not\r\nsuddenly, but without unnecessary delay. The two principal reasons\r\nfor retaining the Filipinos as subjects, or \"wards,\" or by whatever\r\neuphemism any one may prefer to designate the relation, are, first,\r\nthat a Filipino government would not properly protect life and\r\nproperty, and second, that although they complain much at taxation\r\nwithout representation through tariff and other legislation placed or\r\nkept on the statute books of Congress through the influence and for\r\nthe benefit of special interests in the United States, yet that such\r\ntaxation without representation is not so grievous as to justify them\r\nin feeling as we did in 1776. Whether these reasons for retaining the\r\nFilipinos as subjects indefinitely are justified by the facts, must\r\ndepend upon the facts. If they are not, the question will then arise,\r\n\"Would a Filipino government be any worse for the Filipinos than the\r\none we are keeping saddled on them over their protest?\"\r\n\r\nIn his letter of instructions of April 7, 1900, to the Taft Commission,\r\nMr. McKinley first quoted the noble concluding language with which\r\nthe articles of capitulation of the city of Manila gave an immediate\r\nand supremely comforting sense of security to a city of some three\r\nhundred thousand people who had then been continuously in terror of\r\ntheir lives for three and one half months, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This city, its inhabitants, * * * and its private property of\r\n    all description * * * are placed under the special safeguard of\r\n    the faith and honor of the American army;\r\n\r\n\r\nand then added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the Government of\r\n    the United States to give protection for property and life * * *\r\n    to all the people of the Philippine Islands. * * * I charge this\r\n    commission to labor for the full performance of this obligation,\r\n    which concerns the honor and conscience of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow the premature setting up of the civil government of the Philippines\r\nin 1901 under pressure of political expediency, and the consequent\r\nwithdrawal of the police protection of the army, was followed by a\r\nlong series of disorders combated by prosecutions for sedition and\r\nbrigandage, toward the end of which the writer broke down and left the\r\nIslands exclaiming inwardly, \"I do not know the method of drawing an\r\nindictment against a whole people,\" will now be traced, not so much\r\nto show that the Philippine insular government has failed properly and\r\ncompetently to meet the most sacred obligations that can rest upon any\r\ngovernment, but to show the inherent unfitness of a government based\r\non the consent of the governed to run any other kind of a government.\r\n\r\nThere were five officers of the Philippine volunteer army of 1899-1901\r\nappointed to the bench by Governor Taft in 1901. Their names and the\r\nmethod of their transition from the military to the civil regime\r\nare indicated by the following communication, a copy of which was\r\nfurnished to each, as indicated in the endorsement which follows the\r\nsignature of Judge Taft:\r\n\r\n\r\n    UNITED STATES PHILIPPINE COMMISSION\r\n\r\n    President's Office, Manila, June 17, 1901.\r\n\r\n    Major-General Arthur MacArthur, U. S. A.,\r\n\r\n    Military Governor of the Philippine Islands, Manila.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sir:\r\n\r\n    I am directed by the commission to inform you that it has made\r\n    the following appointments under the recent Judicial Act passed\r\n    June 11, 1901:\r\n\r\n    You will observe that among our appointees are five army officers:\r\n    Brigadier General James F. Smith, Lieutenant James H. Blount,\r\n    Jr., 29th Infantry, Captain Adam C. Carson, 28th Infantry; Captain\r\n    Warren H. Ickis, 36th Infantry; and Lieutenant George P. Whitsett,\r\n    32d Infantry.\r\n\r\n    It is suggested that it would be well for these officers to resign\r\n    their positions in the United States military service to the end\r\n    that they may accept the civil positions, take the oath of office,\r\n    and immediately begin their new duties.\r\n\r\n    I have the honor to be, very respectfully,\r\n\r\n\r\n        Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n        (Signed) Wm. H. Taft,\r\n        President.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Official extract copy respectfully furnished Lieutenant James\r\n    H. Blount, Jr., 29th Infantry, U. S. Vols., Manila, P. I. Your\r\n    resignation, if offered in compliance with above letter, will be\r\n    accepted upon the date preferred.\r\n\r\n    By command of Major-General MacArthur:\r\n\r\n\r\n        (Signed) E. H. Crowder\r\n        Lieutenant-Colonel and Judge Advocate, U. S. A. Secretary.\r\n        Military Secretary's Office,\r\n        June 18, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith had come out as colonel of the 1st Californias, and had\r\nwon his stars on the field of battle, as has already been described in\r\nan earlier chapter. He went from the army to the Supreme Bench--at\r\nManila. The archipelago had been divided by the Taft Commission\r\ninto fifteen judicial districts, containing three or four provinces\r\neach,--each district court to be a nisi prius or trial court. Judge\r\nCarson (Va.) went to the Hemp Peninsula District in the extreme south\r\nof Luzon, already described, and four years later to the Supreme Bench,\r\nwhere he still is. Judge Ickis (Ia.) went to Mindanao, and later died\r\nof the cholera down there. Judge Whitsett (Mo.) went to Jolo (the\r\nlittle group of islets near British North Borneo), but his wife died\r\nsoon afterward, and he resigned and came home. The writer (Ga.) went\r\nto northern Luzon, to the First District hereinafter noticed.\r\n\r\nJust here it may be remarked that the reader will need no long\r\ncomplicated description of the details of the organization of the new\r\ngovernment, interspersed with unpronounceable names, if he will simply\r\nassume the view-point Governor Taft had in the beginning. Governor\r\nTaft simply analogized his situation to that of a governor of a State\r\nor Territory at home. His fifty provinces were to him fifty counties,\r\ntwenty-five of them in the main island of Luzon, which, as heretofore\r\nstated, is about the size of Ohio or Cuba (forty odd thousand square\r\nmiles), and contains half the population and over one-third the total\r\nland area of the archipelago. However, each of his provincial governors\r\nwas liberally paid, and the authority of a governor of a province\r\nwas, on a small scale, more like that of one of our own state chief\r\nexecutives than like the authority and functions of the chairman of\r\nthe Board of County Commissioners of a county with us. For instance,\r\nthe governorship of Cebu, with its 2000 square miles of territory\r\nand 650,000 inhabitants, was quite as big a job as the governorship\r\nof New Mexico, or some other one of our newer States.\r\n\r\nSo that the task on which Governor Taft entered July 4, 1901, was\r\nthe governing of a potential ultimate federal union in miniature,\r\ncontaining nearly eight millions of people. One slight mistake I\r\nthink he made was in providing that the governors of the provinces\r\nshould be ex-officio sheriffs of the Courts of First Instance\r\n(of the fifteen several judicial districts aforesaid). This was to\r\nenable the Judges of First Instance to keep a weather eye on the\r\nprovincial governors, the judiciary at first being largely American,\r\nand it being the programme to have native governors, some of them\r\nrecently surrendered insurgent generals, as rapidly as practicable\r\nand advisable. The scheme was good business, but not tactful. It\r\nsubtracted some wind from the gubernatorial sails to be a sheriff,\r\na provincial governor under the Spanish regime having been quite a\r\nvice-regal potentate. But the judges were as careful to treat their\r\nnative governors with the consideration the authority vested in them\r\ncalled for as Governor Taft himself would have been. So no substantial\r\nharm was done, and the real power in the provinces of questionable\r\nloyalty remained where it belonged, in American hands.\r\n\r\nJust after Governor Taft's inauguration, the four newly appointed\r\ndistrict judges just out of the army called on the governor. Judge\r\nCarson was the spokesman, though without pre-arrangement. He said:\r\n\"Governor, we have called to pay our respects and say goodbye before\r\ngoing to the provinces. We have been acting under military orders so\r\nlong, that while we are not here to get orders, we would like to have\r\nany parting suggestions that may occur to you.\" Governor Taft said:\r\n\"Well, Gentlemen, all I can think of is to remind you that if what\r\nwe have all heard is true the Spanish courts usually operated to the\r\ndelay of justice, rather than to the dispensing of it. So just go\r\nahead to your respective districts, and get to work, remembering that\r\nyou are Americans.\" So we did. Of course none of us loaned ourselves\r\nfor a moment to the amiable Taft fiction that \"the great majority of\r\nthe people are entirely willing to government under the supremacy\r\nof the United States.\" We had all had a share in the subjugation\r\nof the Islands as far as it had progressed at that time, and had\r\nseen the Filipinos fight--unskilfully and ineffectively, it is true\r\n(because they none of them understood the use of two sights on a rifle,\r\nand simply could not hit us much), but pluckily enough. We knew the\r\nFilipinos well, and our attitude was simply that of \"Pharaoh and the\r\nSergeant,\" in Kipling's ballad of the conquest of Egypt. However,\r\nwe knew nothing of the Egyptians, except what we had learned in the\r\nBible, gave no thought to whether our occupation was to be \"temporary\"\r\nlike the British occupation of Egypt since 1882, or temporary like\r\nthe American occupation of Cuba in 1898. That was a matter for the\r\npeople of the United States to determine later. But somebody had to\r\ngovern the Islands, and there we were, and there were the Islands. In\r\nthe scheme of things some one had to do that part of the world's work,\r\nand, as the salaries were liberal, we went to the work, not concerning\r\nourselves with amiable fictions of any kind. I think our attitude\r\nwas really one of more intimately sympathetic understanding of the\r\nFilipinos than that of Governor Taft himself, because we had all known\r\nthem longer, and all spoke their language, i. e., the language of\r\nthe educated and representative men (Spanish), and knew their ways,\r\ntheir foibles, and their many indisputably noble traits. But we did\r\nnot start out to play the part of political wet-nurses. Our attitude\r\nwas, if Mr. Filipino does not behave, we will make him.\r\n\r\nJudge Carson and myself had one peculiar qualification for fidelity\r\nto the Taft policies for which we were entitled to no credit. We\r\ninstinctively resented any suggestion comparing the Filipinos to\r\nnegroes. We had many warm friends among the Filipinos, had shared\r\ntheir generous hospitality often, and in turn had extended them\r\nours. Any such suggestion as that indicated implied that we had been\r\ndoing something equivalent to eating, drinking, dancing, and chumming\r\nwith negroes. And we resented such suggestions with an anger quite as\r\ncordial and intense as the canons of good taste and loyal friendship\r\ndemanded. I really believe that the southern men in the Philippines\r\nhave always gotten along better with the Filipinos than any other\r\nAmericans out there, and for the reasons just suggested. Not only\r\nis the universal American willingness to treat the educated Asiatic\r\nas a human being endowed with certain unalienable rights going to\r\nredeem him from the down-trodden condition into which British and\r\nother European contempt for him has kept him, but the American from\r\nthe South out there is a guarantee that he shall never be treated as\r\nif he were an African. The African is aeons of time behind the Asiatic\r\nin development; the latter is aeons ahead of us in the mere duration\r\nof his civilization. The Filipino has many of the virtues both of the\r\nEuropean and the Asiatic. Christianity has made him the superior in\r\nmany respects, of his neighbor and racial cousin, the Japanese. And\r\nSpanish civilization has produced among them many educated gentlemen\r\nwhom it is an honor to call friend.\r\n\r\nThe five lawyers, who on ceasing to be volunteer officers became\r\njudges, had other incentives also to make the Taft Government a\r\nsuccess. The possession of power is always pleasant. We knew the\r\nmilitary folk were going to stand by and watch the civil government,\r\nand prophesy failure. This of course put us on our metal to impress\r\nupon the dictatorial gentry of the military profession, with didactic\r\nfirmness, the fundamental importance to all American ideals that the\r\nmilitary should be subordinate to the civil authority.\r\n\r\nThe First Judicial District to which the writer was first assigned\r\ncomprised four provinces, Ilocos Norte, in the Ilocano country, the\r\nprovince situated at the extreme northwestern corner of Luzon, in the\r\nmilitary district the conquest of which by General Young has already\r\nbeen fully described; and the three provinces of the Cagayan valley,\r\n[371] overrun by Captain Batchelor on his remarkable march from the\r\nmountains to the sea in November, 1899, also already described. Here\r\nI remained for a year, and then came home on leave, desperately\r\nill; being given, on returning to the Islands after my recovery,\r\nan assignment in one of the southern islands, hereinafter dealt with.\r\n\r\nWe volunteers were all commissioned as judges as of the 15th of June,\r\nthough none of us I believe were mustered out until June 30th. The\r\nday after I was notified of my appointment as judge, as above set\r\nforth, desiring to enter upon my judicial emoluments, which were\r\nseveral times those I was receiving as a soldier, I removed the\r\nshoulder-straps and collar ornaments from my white duck suit, and\r\nwent over and took the oath of office before the Chief Justice of\r\nthe Islands. We had not yet been mustered out of the army, but as\r\nabove stated, Governor Taft had suggested to General MacArthur that\r\nwe resign without waiting for the day of muster out, so we could\r\nget to work that much sooner, and General MacArthur had notified us\r\nthat if we cared to resign at once as suggested, he would cable our\r\nresignations to Washington. Immediately after qualifying before the\r\nChief Justice, I left his office and on emerging from the court-house\r\nhailed a carromata, [372] but the driver said No, he would not carry\r\nme. I suggested in a very rudimental way, in rather rudimental Spanish\r\nsuited to him, that he was a common carrier, and as such under a\r\nduty to transport me. He said his horse was tired. His horse did\r\nnot look tired. He would not have thus casually toyed with veracity\r\nif I had had my shoulder-straps on. An autoridad (a representative\r\nof constituted authority) is to the masses of the Filipino people\r\nsomething which instinctively challenges their respect and obedience,\r\nmore especially where the \"authority\" is firm and just. Respect for\r\nauthority is their most conspicuous civic trait, and it is on this\r\nelement in the lower ninety, on the intelligence and capacity to\r\nguide them of the upper ten, and on the ardent patriotism of both,\r\nthat I predicate my difference with President Taft as to the capacity\r\nof the Filipino people for self-government. However, as I was to all\r\nappearances not an \"authority,\" this ignorant man treated me as merely\r\none of the Americans who, having invaded his country, apparently were\r\nnot sure whether they were afraid of his people or not. Again I tried\r\ndiplomacy, offering him an exorbitant fare. \"Nothing doing.\" It was\r\nabout siesta time, and he would not budge. Here then was the civil\r\ngovernment proposition in a nutshell, to take the ignorant people and\r\nteach them their rights under theoretically free institutions, instead\r\nof letting their own people do it in their own way; to reason directly\r\nwith such people as this cochero (hackman), to begin at the bottom of\r\nthe social scale right on the jump, the idea being to fit them, the\r\nsacred (?) majority, to know their rights and \"knowing dare maintain\"\r\nthem against the educated minority, as if the latter did not have\r\na greater natural interest in their welfare than any stranger could\r\npossibly have. That I indulged all these reflections at the time I\r\nof course do not mean to say. The significance of the incident has\r\nof course deepened in the light of the subsequent years. At any rate,\r\nI did not succeed in budging that cochero. I walked home, forego the\r\ndifference between the military and the judicial salary for the two\r\nweeks remaining before muster-out day, put my shoulder-straps back on,\r\nand kept them on until June 30, 1901. [373]\r\n\r\nWhen I first landed on the China seacoast of the district I was to\r\npreside over, I was met by quite a reception committee of the leading\r\nmen, who conducted me with great courtesy to the provincial capital. A\r\nlittle later the justices of the peace paid their respects. One\r\nof them came thirty miles to do so. The court-room was very long,\r\nand when I first spied this last man, he was at the other end of\r\nthe room bowing very low. He would bow, then advance a few steps,\r\nthen bow again, then resume the forward march toward me. I reminded\r\nmyself of some ancient king, so profound were his obeisances. At\r\nfirst I thought to myself, \"He bows too low, he must have been up to\r\nsome devilment lately!\" Experience showed me later that it was simply\r\none of the ever-present manifestations of the respect of the Filipino\r\nfor constituted authority. They positively love to show their respect\r\nfor authority, just as a good soldier loves to show his respect for\r\nan officer. Here some American remarks: \"Ah, but that is not good\r\nproof of capacity for self-government. They would not 'cuss out' the\r\nparty in power enough.\" I answer: Who made you the judge to say that\r\nour particular form of government and our particular way of doing\r\nthings is better for each and every other people under the sun than\r\nany they can devise for themselves? But there was of course another\r\npossible reason for the profundity of the obeisances of my judicial\r\nsubordinate above mentioned. When I reached that province of Ilocos\r\nNorte in July, 1901, the people were in a state of submission that was\r\nsimply abject. They had at first worked the amigo business on General\r\nYoung, and treachery of that kind had been so inexorably followed by\r\ndire punishment, that every home in the country had its lesson. Yet\r\nthat was the only way. The poor devils did not seem to know when they\r\nwere licked. This is not maudlin sentiment. It is a protest against the\r\ncotemporary libel on Filipino patriotism about \"the great majority\"\r\nbeing \"entirely willing\" to accept our rule, and the cotemporary\r\nbelittling of the work the army had to do to make them accept it.\r\n\r\nI remained in charge of the First Judicial District for more\r\nthan a year, and during that period tried few or no crimes of a\r\npolitical character, that is to say, indictments for sedition or the\r\nlike--attempts to subvert the government. The district comprised a\r\ntotal population of about a half million people, more than one-eighth\r\nof the population of Luzon, and a total area of over 13,000 square\r\nmiles, nearly one-third of all Luzon. But remember, this was in\r\nnorthern Luzon, where the work of pacification was lucidly completed\r\nby the army before the \"peace-at-any-price\" policy began. We will see\r\nwhat happened in my friend Judge Carson's district, and in the rest of\r\nsouthern Luzon later. The principal broad general fact I now recall,\r\nin connection with the administration of justice in the First Judicial\r\nDistrict during the year or more I had it, is that the main volume of\r\nbusiness on the court calendars was crimes of violence of a strictly\r\nnon-political character due to lack of efficient police protection\r\nin the several communities, consequent on withdrawal of military\r\ngarrisons. The country was in an unsettled state. The aftermath\r\nof war, lawless violence, was virulently present, and the presence\r\nof troops scattered through a province, under such circumstances,\r\nis a wonderful moral force to restrain lawlessness. However high\r\nthe purpose, however kindly the motive, the setting up of a civil\r\ngovernment in the Philippines at the time it was set up, when the\r\ncountry was far from ready for it, was a terrible mistake. Of course\r\nno one man in a given province or judicial district had a bird's-eye\r\nview of the whole situation and the whole panorama at the time,\r\nsuch as we can get at this distance, in retrospect. Of course it did\r\nnot lie in human nature for the men responsible for the mistake to\r\nsee it at first, and, the die once cast, they had to keep on, with\r\nintermittent resort to military help, the extent of which help was\r\nalways minimized thereafter. To show how little the general state of\r\nthe archipelago was understood by American provincial officials busy in\r\na given part of it, and getting little or no news of the outside world,\r\nI remained in the First Judicial District from July, 1901, to August,\r\n1902, and heard nothing of the great insurrection in southern Luzon,\r\nin Batangas, and the adjacent provinces, which raged during the winter\r\nof 1901-02, except a vague rumor that there was trouble down there. The\r\nFilipinos did, however. Of course for Mr. Root to be able to furnish\r\nin December, 1901, a report, as Secretary of War, to the President,\r\nfor consumption by Congress and the people of this country, to the\r\neffect that his volunteer army had been mustered out on schedule time,\r\nJune 30, 1901, and a \"civil\" government set up and in due operation,\r\nwas a nice showing, calculated to sooth latent public discontent with\r\nwading through slaughter to over-seas dominion. Reports thereafter of\r\ndisturbances could always be waived aside as merely local in character,\r\nand not serious. If it were stoutly asserted that everything was\r\nquiet all over the archipelago except in certain parts of certain\r\nlocalities, naming them, that sounded well, and as the public at home\r\nsimply skipped the unpronounceable names, not caring much whether they\r\nrepresented molecules or hemispheres, all went well. For instance,\r\nmost of the provinces of the archipelago were organized under \"civil\"\r\ngovernment prior to the inauguration of Governor Taft, which occurred,\r\nJuly 4, 1901, and on July 17th, thereafter, Batangas, Cebu, and Bohol\r\nwere restored to military control. [374] I suppose the fact that\r\nBatangas, Cebu, and Bohol had been so restored was duly announced\r\nat the time in the Associated Press despatches from Manila. But\r\nwhat light did it throw on the situation? Who knew whether any one\r\nof these names represented a mountain lair, a country village, a\r\nremote islet, or a large and populous province? As a matter of fact,\r\neach was a province, and the total population of the three provinces\r\nwas 1,180,655, [375] and their total area 4651 square miles. [376]\r\nThe eminent gentlemen charged with the government of the Islands,\r\nonce they committed themselves to their \"civil\" government, persisted\r\nalways in treating the insurrection, as General Hancock's campaign\r\nspeeches used to treat the tariff--as \"a local issue.\" The true\r\nanalogy, that of a house on fire, with the fire partly but not wholly\r\nunder control, and momentarily subject to gusts of wind, never seems\r\nto have occurred to them. Here were provinces aggregating nearly\r\ntwelve hundred thousand people, officially admitted to be still in\r\ninsurrection within less than two weeks after the announcement of\r\nthe inauguration of a civil government, which included them, with\r\nits implied assertion of a state of peace as to them.\r\n\r\nIf to the three provinces above named you add the province of Samar,\r\nlater of dark and bloody fame, you have a fourth province as to which\r\nnot only had there been no \"civil\" government organized on paper, but\r\nno claim yet made by any one that we had ever conquered it. We had been\r\nso busy in Luzon and elsewhere that we had not yet had time to bother\r\nvery much with Samar. The area of Samar is 5276 square miles, and its\r\npopulation 266,237. (See the census tables already cited.) In their\r\nreport dated October 15, 1901, [377] you find the Commission admitting\r\nthat \"the insurrection still continues in Batangas, Samar, Cebu\" and\r\n\"parts of\" Laguna and Tayabas provinces. Now the euphemistic limitation\r\nimplied in the words \"parts of\" is quite negligible, for any serious\r\npurpose, since our troops kept the insurgents rather constantly on the\r\nmove, and the population in all the \"parts of\" any province that was\r\nstill holding out backed up the combatants morally and materially,\r\nwith information as to our movements, supplies, etc., whenever\r\nthe insurgent detachments, in the course of their peregrinations,\r\nhappened to pass through those \"parts.\" So, to make a recapitulation\r\npresenting the political situation admitted by the Commission to exist\r\na little over three months after the inauguration of civil government,\r\nwe have the insurrection still in progress as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Province             Area (sq. m.)          Population\r\n\r\n    Batangas              1,201                   257,715\r\n    Cebu                  1,939                   653,727\r\n    Bohol                 1,511                   269,223\r\n    Laguna                  629                   148,606\r\n    Tayabas               5,993                   153,065\r\n    Samar                 5,276                   266,237\r\n                         ------                 ---------\r\n        Total            16,549                 1,748,573\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to his own official statements, it thus appears that on\r\nOctober 15th, after Governor Taft set up his \"civil\" government on\r\nthe Fourth of July, throughout one-fifth of the territory and among\r\none-fourth of the population insurrection was rampant. The total\r\narea of the archipelago, if Mohammedan Mindanao be excepted (for the\r\nreason that the Moros never had anything to do with the Filipinos\r\nand their insurrection against us), is about 80,000 square miles,\r\nhaving a total population of 7,000,000. So that, to restate the\r\ncase, one-fifth of the house was still on fire, and one-fourth of\r\nthe inmates were trying their best to keep the fire from being put out.\r\n\r\nJust here I owe it to President Taft, under whose administration\r\nas governor I served as a judge, as well as to myself, to explain\r\nwhy I have so frequently put the word \"civil\" in quotations in\r\nreferring to the civil government of the Philippines. Broadly\r\nspeaking, if \"civil\" does not imply consent of the governed, it\r\nat least distinctly negatives the idea of a bleeding, prostrate,\r\nand deeply hostile people. And, in that the civil government of the\r\nPhilippines founded in 1901 did so negative the actual conditions it\r\nwas a kindly humbug. When you go around the country sending people\r\nto the penitentiary by scores for political crimes, and then get\r\ncriticised afterwards for \"subserviency\" to the government you are\r\nthus serving, you get a trifle sensitive about such criticism. Now\r\nthe core of the charges made in this country against the Philippine\r\njudiciary in the early days was that they were parties to a humbug,\r\npliable servants of a government which was trying to produce at home\r\nan incorrect impression of substantial absence of unwillingness on\r\nthe part of the governed. I am very sure that the five ex-officers of\r\nthe volunteer army above named, who went from the army to the bench,\r\nnever did, by act or word, lend themselves to the idea that there was\r\nany \"consent\" on the part of the governed. Those of us who had been\r\nin Cuba with General Wood had but a little while previously observed\r\nthere a civil regime under a military name. We were now, in the\r\nPhilippines, serving a military regime under a civil name. We had all\r\nof us doubtless--if there was an exception it is immaterial--served\r\non military commissions. We therefore felt, without immodesty,\r\nthat we could deal out to insurrectos and their political cousins,\r\nthe brigands, more even-handed justice, as a military commission\r\nof one, than a board of several officers, booted, spurred, and\r\ntravel-stained from some recent man-hunt. Turning, however, from\r\nthe more inconspicuous objects of Professor Willis's attacks, [378]\r\nthe American trial judges in the Philippines in the pioneer days, to\r\nthe now wide-looming historic personage who was his real objective,\r\nI was asked at a public meeting in Boston, rather significantly,\r\nby one of the most eminent lawyers in this country, Mr. Moorfield\r\nStorey, formerly president of the American Bar Association, whether\r\nor not there had been attempts in the Philippines, while I was there,\r\nto make the judiciary subservient to the executive. My answer was, \"No,\r\nthe lawyers who have been in charge of the Philippine Government have\r\nnever been guilty of any unprofessional conduct.\" But the distinguished\r\nBoston barrister above referred to has a nephew who is now and has been\r\nsince 1909, Governor of the Philippines--and who, before he went out\r\nthere was a representative of Big Business in Boston--Governor Forbes,\r\nand I have no idea that any judge who during that time has rendered\r\nany decision of importance he did not like has been promoted to the\r\nSupreme Bench of the Islands, though I know that under Governor Taft,\r\nJudge Carson unhesitatingly declared a certain act of the Commission\r\nnull and void as being in conflict with an Act of Congress, and\r\nbefore the time-servers had gotten through wondering at his rashness,\r\nMr. Taft had him put on the Supreme Bench of the Philippines [379]\r\nbecause he liked that kind of a judge.\r\n\r\nHaving sown the wind by setting up his civil government too soon,\r\nlet us now observe the whirlwind Governor Taft reaped within six\r\nmonths thereafter. Of course the civil and military folk were at\r\ndaggers' points. That goes without saying. But their differences\r\nwere decorously suppressed so that the Filipinos did not get hold\r\nof them. To that end, the situation was also diligently concealed\r\nin the United States. In his proclamation of July 4, 1902, you find\r\nPresident Roosevelt publicly smoothing the ruffled feathers of that\r\nrugged hero of many battles in two hemispheres, General Chaffee, and\r\nalso commending Governor Taft, and telling them how harmoniously they\r\nhad gotten along together to the credit of their common country. But\r\nin 1901, shortly after General Chaffee had relieved General MacArthur,\r\nyou find the following cablegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                          Executive Mansion, Washington,\r\n                                                        October 8, 1901.\r\n\r\n    Chaffee, Manila: I am deeply chagrined, to use the mildest possible\r\n    term, over the trouble between yourself and Taft. I wish you\r\n    to see him personally, and spare no effort to secure prompt and\r\n    friendly agreement in regard to the differences between you. Have\r\n    cabled him also. It is most unfortunate to have any action which\r\n    produces friction and which may have a serious effect both in\r\n    the Philippines and here at home. I trust implicitly that you\r\n    and Taft will come to agreement.\r\n\r\n        Theodore Roosevelt. [380]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important words of the above telegram are \"and here at\r\nhome.\" The \"serious effect here at home\" so earnestly deprecated was\r\nthat the real issue between General Chaffee and Governor Taft might\r\nbe ventilated by some Congressional Committee, and thus bring out\r\nthe prematurity with which, to meet political exigencies, the civil\r\ngovernment had been set up. The issue was that General Chaffee was\r\nrecognizing the hostility of the people, and deprecating the withdrawal\r\nof the police protection of the army from districts in which there\r\nwere many people who, though tired of keeping up the struggle, and\r\nwilling to quit, were being harried by the die-in-the-last-ditch\r\ncontingent. This would mean, ultimately, an examination, such as has\r\nalready been made in this volume, of the evidence on which Governor\r\nTaft based his half-baked opinion of 1900 that \"the great majority\"\r\nwere \"entirely willing\" to American sovereignty. It would also show\r\nup Mr. Root's nonsense about \"the patient and unconsenting millions,\"\r\nso shamelessly flouted in the presidential campaign of 1900, and his\r\npious Philippics against delivering said millions \"into the hands of\r\nthe assassin, Aguinaldo,\" [381] and would reveal the truth confessed\r\nby Secretary Root in a speech made to the cadets at West Point in July,\r\n1902, after the trouble had blown over, in which, apropos of the valor\r\nand services of the army, he referred proudly to its having then just\r\ncompleted the suppression of \"an insurrection of 7,000,000 people.\"\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 1901, just prior to President Roosevelt's above\r\ncablegram pouring oil on the troubled politico-military insular\r\nwaters, a company of General Chaffee's command, Company C, of the\r\n9th Infantry, had been taken off their guard and massacred at a place\r\ncalled Balangiga, in the island of Samar. [382] This had made General\r\nChaffee somewhat angry, and explains the subsequent dark and bloody\r\ndrama of which General \"Jake\" Smith was the central figure, whereby\r\nSamar was made \"a howling wilderness.\" But Governor Taft was filled\r\nwith much more solicitude about the success of his civil government\r\nthan he was about the obscure lives lost at Balangiga. Apropos\r\nof the Balangiga affair he was wearing the patience of the doughty\r\nChaffee with remarks like this: \"The people are friendly to the civil\r\ngovernment,\" and suavely speaking of \"the evidence which accumulates\r\non every hand of the desire of the people at large for peace and\r\nprotection by the civil government.\" [383] The same Taft report goes\r\non to deprecate \"rigor in the treatment\" of the situation and the\r\n\"consequent revulsion in those feelings of friendship toward the\r\nAmericans which have been growing stronger each day with the spread\r\nand development of the civil government.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral \"Jake\" Smith was sent to Samar shortly after the Balangiga\r\nmassacre, and did indeed make the place a howling wilderness, with his\r\nfamous \"kill-and-burn\" orders, instructions to \"kill everything over\r\nten years old\" and so forth, and the army was in sympathy generally\r\nwith most of what he did,--except, of course, the unspeakable \"10 year\r\nold\" part--piously exclaiming, as fallible human nature often will in\r\nsuch circumstances, \"Vengeance is mine, saith the Lord.\" Now the civil\r\ngovernment could have put a stop to all this if it had wanted to. It\r\nhad the backing of President Roosevelt. But it quietly accepted the\r\nbenefit of such \"fear of God\"--to use the army's rather sacrilegious\r\nexpression about that Samar campaign--as the military arm put into\r\nthe heart of the Filipino, and went on the even tenor of its way,\r\nstill maintaining that the Filipinos must like us because the civil\r\ngovernment was so benevolent,--as if the Filipinos drew any nice\r\ndistinctions between Governor Taft and General Chaffee, or supposed\r\nthe two did not represent one and the same government, the government\r\nof the United States. There was much investigation about that awful\r\nSamar campaign afterward. General Smith was court-martialed and partly\r\nwhitewashed, at least not dismissed. At General Smith's court-martial,\r\nthere was some dispute about the alleged orders to \"kill and burn,\"\r\nto \"kill everything over ten years old,\" etc. But the nature of the\r\ncampaign may be inferred from General Smith's famous circular No. 6,\r\nwhich, issued on Christmas eve, 1901, advised his command, in effect,\r\nthat he did not take much stock in the civil commission's confidence\r\nthat the people really wanted peace; that he was \"thoroughly convinced\"\r\nthat the wealthy people in the towns of his district were aiding the\r\ninsurgents while pretending to be friendly and that he proposed to\r\n\r\n\r\n    adopt a policy that will create in all the minds of all the\r\n    people a burning desire for the war to cease; a desire or longing\r\n    so intense, so personal, and so real that it will impel them to\r\n    devote themselves in real earnest to bringing about a real state\r\n    of peace. [384]\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring all his trial troubles, General Smith \"took what was coming\r\nto him\" without a murmur, and General Chaffee stuck to him as far as\r\nhe could without assuming the primary responsibility for the fearful\r\norders above alluded to. If, when General Smith went to Samar, his\r\nsuperior officer, General Chaffee, was in just the direly vengeful\r\nframe of mind he, General Smith, afterwards displayed, and prompted\r\nhim to do, substantially, what he afterward did, which is by no\r\nmeans unlikely, General Smith never whimpered or put the blame on his\r\nchief. But a fearful lesson was given the Filipinos, and the civil\r\ngovernment profited by it. General Chaffee was never really pressed\r\non whether he did or did not prompt General Smith to do what he did;\r\nGovernor Taft was never even criticised for not protesting; but with\r\na flourish of presidential trumpets, General Smith was finally made\r\n\"the goat,\" by being summarily placed on the retired list, and that\r\nclosed the bloody Samar episode of 1901-02. I wonder General Smith\r\nhas not gone and wept on General Miles's shoulder and like him become\r\na member of the Anti-Imperialist League of Boston. Some of the best\r\nfighting men in the army say that as a soldier in battle General\r\nSmith is superb. At any rate he may find spiritual consolation in the\r\nfollowing passage of the Scriptures which fits and describes his case:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall be\r\n    presented alive before the Lord, to make an atonement with him,\r\n    and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness. [385]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his Report for 1901 Governor Taft says that the four principal\r\nprovinces, including Batangas, which gave trouble shortly after the\r\ncivil government was set up in that year, and had to be returned\r\nto military control, were organized under civil rule \"on the\r\nrecommendation\" of the then commanding general (MacArthur) [386]: It\r\ncertainly seems unlikely that the haste to change from military rule\r\nto civil rule came on the motion of the military. If the Commission\r\never got, in writing, from General MacArthur, a \"recommendation\" that\r\nany provinces be placed under civil rule while still in insurrection,\r\nthe text of the writing will show a mere soldiery acquiescence in the\r\nwill of Mr. McKinley, the commander-in-chief. Parol contemporaneous\r\nevidence will show that General MacArthur told them, substantially,\r\nthat they were \"riding for a fall.\" In fact, whenever an insurrection\r\nwould break out in a province after Governor Taft's inauguration as\r\ngovernor, the whole attitude of the army in the Philippines, from\r\nthe commanding general down, was \"I told you so.\" They did not say\r\nthis where Governor Taft could hear it, but it was common knowledge\r\nthat they were much addicted to damning \"politics\" as the cause of\r\nall the trouble.\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft's statement in his report for 1901, that the four\r\nprincipal provinces, above named, Batangas and the rest, were organized\r\nunder civil rule \"on the recommendation of General MacArthur,\"\r\nis fully explained in his testimony before the Senate Committee of\r\n1902. From the various passages hereinbefore quoted from President\r\nMcKinley's state papers concerning the Philippines, especially\r\nhis messages to Congress, the political pressure Mr. McKinley was\r\nunder from the beginning to make a show of \"civil\" government, thus\r\nemphasizing the alleged absence of any real substantial opposition\r\nto our rule by a seeming absence of necessity for the use of force,\r\nso as to palliate American repugnance to forcing a government upon an\r\nunwilling people, has been made clear. There were to be no \"dark days\r\nof reconstruction.\" The Civil War in the United States from 1861 to\r\n1865 was a love feast compared with our war in the Philippines. Yet the\r\nwork of reconstruction in the Philippines was to be predicated on the\r\ntheory of consent, so persistently urged by President McKinley before\r\nthe American people from the beginning, viz., that the insurrection\r\nrepresented only a small faction of the people. We have seen how\r\nGeneral MacArthur also had originally, in 1898, entertained this\r\nnotion, and how by the time he took Malolos in March, 1899, he had\r\ngotten over this notion, and had--regretfully--recognized that \"the\r\nwhole people are loyal to Aguinaldo and the cause he represents.\" And\r\nnow came Governor Taft, after fifteen months more of continuous\r\nfighting, to tell General MacArthur, on behalf of Mr. McKinley,\r\nthat he, MacArthur, did not know what he was talking about, and that\r\n\"the great majority\" were for American rule. The representative\r\nmen of my own State of Georgia welcomed the return of the State to\r\nmilitary control in 1870. Most of them had been officers of the\r\nConfederate army. The Federal commander simply told them that if\r\nthey could not restrain the lawless element of their own people, he\r\nwould. By premature setting up of the Philippine civil government,\r\nthe lawless element was allowed full swing. General MacArthur had\r\nbeen in the Civil War. He knew something about reconstruction. But\r\nhere were the Taft Commission, with instructions from Mr. McKinley to\r\nthe effect that civil government, government \"essentially popular in\r\nform,\" was to be set up as fast as territory was conquered. It didn't\r\nmake any difference about the government being \"essentially popular\"\r\njust so it was \"essentially popular in form.\" To the Senate Committee\r\nof 1902, Governor Taft said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    General MacArthur and the Commission did differ as to where the\r\n    power lay with respect to the organization of civil governments,\r\n    as to who should say what civil governments should be organized,\r\n    the Commission contending that, under the instructions, it was\r\n    left to them, and General MacArthur thinking that everything was\r\n    subject to military control ultimately, in view of the fact that\r\n    the islands were in a state of war. [387]\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft then added that he and General MacArthur reached a\r\nmodus vivendi. When a good soldier once finds out just what his\r\ncommander-in-chief wants done, he will endeavor, in loyal good\r\nfaith, to carry out the spirit of instructions, no matter how\r\nunwise they may seem to him. As soon as General MacArthur saw what\r\nPresident McKinley wanted done, he proceeded to co-operate loyally\r\nwith Governor Taft to carry out the plan. He well knew the country\r\nwas not ready for civil government, but if Mr. McKinley was bent on\r\ncrowding civil government forward as fast as territory was conquered,\r\nhe would make his recommendations on that basis. In the matter of\r\nthe utter folly of the prematurity with which the civil government\r\nwas set up in the Philippines in 1901, and the terrible consequences\r\nto the hapless Filipinos, hereinafter described, which followed,\r\nby reason of the premature withdrawal of the police protection of\r\nthe army and the sense of security its several garrisons radiated,\r\nfrom a country just recovering from some six years of war, General\r\nMacArthur's exemption from responsibility is shown by his reports\r\nfor 1900 and 1901. [388] The former has already been fully examined,\r\nand the original sharp differences between him and Governor Taft\r\nmade clear. In the latter report dated July 4, 1901, the date of\r\nthe Taft inauguration as Governor, and also, if I mistake not, the\r\nday of General MacArthur's final departure for the United States,\r\nthe latter washes his hands of the kindly McKinley-Taft nonsense,\r\nborn of political expediency, about there having never been any real\r\nfundamental or unanimous resistance, in no uncertain terms thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Anything in the immediate future calculated to impede the\r\n    activity or reduce the efficiency of these instruments [our\r\n    military forces,] will not only be a menace to the present, but\r\n    put in jeopardy the entire future of American possibilities in\r\n    the archipelago. [389]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, President Taft can never make General MacArthur \"the goat\" for\r\nwhat General Bell had to do in Batangas Province in 1901-02 to make\r\nour \"willing\" subjects behave. Nor can the ultimate responsibility\r\nbefore the bar of history for the awful fact that, according to the\r\nUnited States Coast and Geodetic Survey Atlas of the Philippines of\r\n1899, the population of Batangas Province was 312,192, and according\r\nto the American Census of the Philippines of 1903 it was 257,715,\r\n[390] rest entirely on military shoulders. An attempt to place the\r\nresponsibility for the prematurity of the civil government on General\r\nMacArthur was made by Honorable Henry C. Ide, who was of the Taft\r\nCommission of 1900, and later Governor General of the Islands, and\r\nis now Minister to Spain, in the North American Review for December,\r\n1907. But Mr. Taft, a man of nobler mould, has at least maintained a\r\ndecorous silence on the subject except when interrogated by Congress,\r\nand when so interrogated, his testimony, above quoted, if analyzed,\r\nplaces the responsibility where it honestly belongs. In 1900 the Taft\r\nCommission were not taking much military advice.\r\n\r\nBatangas province was first taken under the wing of the\r\npeace-at-any-price policy by the Act of the Taft Commission of May 2,\r\n1901, entitled \"An Act Extending the Provisions of 'the Provincial\r\nGovernment Act' [391] to the Province of Batangas.\" By the Act of\r\nthe Commission of July 17, 1901, the provinces of Batangas, Cebu, and\r\nBohol, were restored to military control. When the civil authorities\r\nturned those provinces back to military control, they well knew the\r\nframe of mind the military were in, and there is no escape from the\r\nproposition that they, in effect, said to the military: \"Take them\r\nand chasten them; go as far as you like. After you are done with them,\r\nit will be time enough to pet them again. But for the present we mean\r\nbusiness.\" General Bell was scathingly criticised on the floor of the\r\nUnited States Senate for what he did in Batangas in 1901-02, but by\r\nthe time he took hold there it had become a case of \"spare the rod\r\nand spoil the child.\" The substitution by the Commission of kindness,\r\nand a disposition to forget what the Filipinos could not forget, for\r\nfirmness and the policy of making them submit unreservedly to the\r\ninevitable,--viz., abandonment of their dream of independence--had\r\ncreated among them a well-nigh ineradicable impression that, for some\r\nreason or other, whether due to disapproval in the United States\r\nof the so-called \"imperial\" policy or what not, we were afraid of\r\nthem. General Bell's task in Batangas, therefore, was to eradicate\r\nthis impression all over the archipelago by making an example of the\r\nBatangas people.\r\n\r\nIn General Chaffee's report for 1902, [392] he prefaces his account\r\nof General Bell's operations in Batangas as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The long-continued resistance in the province of Batangas and\r\n    in certain parts of the bordering provinces of Tayabas, Laguna,\r\n    and Cavite, had made it apparent to me and to others that the\r\n    insurrectionary force keeping up the struggle there could exist\r\n    and maintain itself only through the connivance and knowledge\r\n    of practically all the inhabitants; that it received the active\r\n    support of many who professed friendship for United States\r\n    authority, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis last was a thrust at Governor Taft's new-found Filipino friends\r\nand advisers, in whose lack of sympathy with the cause of their\r\ncountry the Governor so profoundly believed, but in whose continuing\r\nco-operation in the killing of his soldiers General Chaffee believed\r\nstill more profoundly.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bell's famous operations on a large scale in Batangas began\r\nJanuary 1, 1902. The great mistake of the Civil Commission, to which\r\nthey adhered so long, was in supposing that when the respectable\r\nmilitary element of the insurgents was pursued to capture or surrender,\r\nthese last could and would thereafter control the situation. As a\r\nmatter of fact, whether they could or not, they did not.\r\n\r\nIn his celebrated circular order dated Batangas, December 9, 1901,\r\nGeneral Bell announced:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To all Station Commanders:\r\n\r\n    A general conviction, which the brigade commander shares,\r\n    appears to exist, that the insurrection in this brigade continues\r\n    because the greater part of the people, especially the wealthy\r\n    ones, pretend to desire, but do not in reality want peace; that\r\n    when all really want peace, we can have it promptly. Under such\r\n    circumstances, it is clearly indicated that a policy should be\r\n    adopted that will, as soon as possible, make the people want\r\n    peace and want it badly.\r\n\r\n    The only acceptable and convincing evidence of the real sentiments\r\n    of either individuals or town councils should be such acts\r\n    publicly performed as must inevitably commit them irrevocably to\r\n    the side of Americans by arousing the animosity of the insurgent\r\n    element. * * * No person should be given credit for loyalty simply\r\n    because he takes the oath of allegiance, or secretly conveys to\r\n    Americans worthless information and idle rumors which result in\r\n    nothing. Those who publicly guide our troops to the camps of the\r\n    enemy, who publicly identify insurgents, who accompany troops in\r\n    operations against the enemy, who denounce and assist in arresting\r\n    the secret enemies of the Government, who publicly obtain and\r\n    bring reliable and valuable information to commanding officers,\r\n    those in fact who publicly array themselves against the insurgents,\r\n    and for Americans, should be trusted and given credit for loyalty,\r\n    but no others. No person should be given credit for loyalty solely\r\n    on account of having done nothing for or against us so far as\r\n    known. Neutrality should not be tolerated. Every inhabitant of\r\n    this brigade should be either active friend or be classed as enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his Circular Order No. 5, dated Batangas, December 13, 1901, [393]\r\nGeneral Bell announced that General Orders No. 100, Adjutant General's\r\nOffice, 1863, approved and published by order of President Lincoln,\r\nfor the government of the armies of the United States in the field,\r\nwould thereafter be regarded as the guide of his subordinates in the\r\nconduct of the war. This order is familiar to all who have ever made\r\nany study of military law. Ordinarily, of course, a captured enemy\r\nis entitled to \"the honors of war,\" i. e., he must be held, housed,\r\nand fed, unless exchanged, until the close of the war. But where an\r\nenemy places himself by his conduct without the pale of the laws of\r\nwar, i. e., where he does not \"play the game according to the rules,\"\r\nhe may be killed on sight, like other outlaws.\r\n\r\nUnder General Orders No. 100, 1863, men and squads of men who,\r\nwithout commission, without being part or portion of the regularly\r\norganized hostile army, fight occasionally only, and with intermittent\r\nreturns to their homes and avocations, and frequent assumption of the\r\nsemblance of peaceful pursuits, divesting themselves of the character\r\nand appearance of soldiers; armed prowlers seeking to cut telegraph\r\nwires, destroy bridges and the like, etc., are not entitled to the\r\nprotection of the laws of war and may be shot on sight. In other\r\nwords, the game being one of life and death, you must take even\r\nchances with your opponent. General Bell's defenders on the floor of\r\nthe Senate simply relied on General Orders No. 100. However, there is\r\nnothing about reconcentration in that order. We learned that from the\r\nSpaniards. In fact we never did succeed in bringing to terms the far\r\nEastern colonies we bought from Spain, until we adopted her methods\r\nwith regard to them. Another of the expedients adopted by General Bell\r\nin Batangas seems harsh, but it was used by Wellington in the latter\r\nend of the Napoleonic wars, and by the Germans in the latter end of\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War. It was to promise the inhabitants of a given\r\nterritory that whenever a telegraph wire or pole was cut the country\r\nwithin a stated radius thereof, including all human habitations,\r\nwould be devastated. It is in General Bell's Circular Order No. 7\r\nof December 15, 1901, [394] that we find the genesis of the idea of\r\nbasing tactics used by Weyler in Cuba on Mr. Lincoln's General Order\r\n100. He there says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Though Section 17, General Orders 100, authorizes the starving\r\n    of unarmed hostile belligerents as well as armed ones, provided\r\n    it leads to a speedier subjection of the enemy, it is considered\r\n    neither justifiable nor desirable to permit any person to starve\r\n    who has come into towns under our control seeking protection.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis order goes on to direct that all food supplies encountered\r\nbe brought to the towns. Of course this does not mean supplies\r\ncaptured from the enemy's forces, which may lawfully be destroyed\r\nat once. To those not familiar with reconcentration tactics it\r\nshould be explained that reconcentration means this: You notify,\r\nby proclamation and otherwise, all persons within a given area, that\r\non and after a certain day they must all leave their homes and come\r\nwithin a certain prescribed zone or radius of which a named town is\r\nusually the centre, there to remain until further orders, and that\r\nall persons found outside that zone after the date named will be\r\ntreated as public enemies. General Bell's order of December 20th,\r\nprovided that rice found in the possession of families outside the\r\nprotected zone should, if practicable, be moved with them to the town\r\nwhich was the centre of the zone, that that found apparently cached\r\nfor enemy's use should be confiscated, and also destroyed if necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whenever it is found absolutely impossible to transport it [any\r\n    food supply] to a point within the protected zone, it will be\r\n    burned or otherwise destroyed. These rules will apply to all\r\n    food products.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo person within the reconcentration zones was permitted to go\r\noutside thereof--cross the dead line--without a written pass. The\r\nCircular Order of December 23d, apparently solicitous lest subordinate\r\ncommanders might become infected with the Taft belief in Filipino\r\naffection, directs that after January 1, 1902, all the municipal\r\nofficials, members of the police force, etc., \"who have not fully\r\ncomplied with their duty by actively aiding the Americans and rendering\r\nthem valuable service,\" shall be summarily thrown into prison. [395]\r\nCircular Order No. 19, issued on Christmas Eve, 1901, provided that,\r\n\r\n\r\n    in order to make the existing state oL war and martial law\r\n    so inconvenient and unprofitable to the people that they will\r\n    earnestly desire and work for the re-establishment of peace and\r\n    civil government,\r\n\r\n\r\nsubordinate commanders might, under certain prescribed restrictions,\r\nput everybody they chose to work on the roads. [396] This was an\r\ningenious blow at the wealthy and soft-handed, intended to superinduce\r\nsubmission by humbling their pride. Note also the seeds of affection\r\nthus sown for the civil government under the reconstruction period\r\nwhich was to follow. In one of Dickens novels there occurs a law\r\nfirm by the name of Spenlow and Jorkins. Mr. Spenlow was quite\r\nfond of considering himself, and of being considered by others, as\r\ntender-hearted. Mr. Jorkins did not mind. When the widow and the orphan\r\nwould plead with Mr. Spenlow to stay the foreclosure of a mortgage,\r\nthat benevolent soul would tell them, with a pained expression of\r\ninfinite sympathy, that he would do all he could for them, but that\r\nthey would have to see Mr. Jorkins, \"who is a very exacting man,\"\r\nhe would say. In the dual American politico-military regime in the\r\nPhilippines of 1901-02, Governor Taft was the Mr. Spenlow, General\r\nChaffee the Mr. Jorkins. But the former always seemed to harbor the\r\namiable delusion that the Filipinos did not at all consider the firm as\r\nthe movants in each proceeding against them, and that on the contrary\r\nthey were sure to make a favorable contrast in their hearts between\r\nthe kindness of Mr. Spenlow and the harshness of Mr. Jorkins. He\r\nseemed blind to the fact that the Filipinos, in considering what was\r\ndone by any of us, spelled us--U. S.\r\n\r\nGeneral Bell's Circular Order No. 22, also a Christmas Eve product,\r\nre-iterates the usual purpose to make the people yearn for civil\r\ngovernment, and the usual warning that none of them really and truly\r\nwant the blessings of American domination and Benevolent Assimilation\r\nas they truly should, and adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To combat such a population, it is necessary to make the state of\r\n    war as insupportable as possible; and there is no more efficacious\r\n    way of accomplishing this than by keeping the minds of the people\r\n    in such a state of anxiety and apprehension that living under such\r\n    conditions will soon become unbearable. Little should be said. The\r\n    less said the better. Let acts, not words, convey intentions. [397]\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder date of December 26, 1901, General Bell reports:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am now assembling in the neighborhood of 2500 men, who will be\r\n    used in columns of fifty each. I expect to accompany the command.\r\n    * * * I take so large a command for the purpose of thoroughly\r\n    searching each ravine, valley, and mountain peak for insurgents\r\n    and for food, expecting to destroy everything I find outside of\r\n    town. All able-bodied men will be killed or captured.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the central idea animating the Bell Brigade that overran\r\nBatangas in 1902. The American soldier in officially sanctioned\r\nwrath is a thing so ugly and dangerous that it would take a Kipling\r\nto describe him. I have seen him in that mood, but to describe it is\r\nbeyond me. Side by side with innumerable ambuscades incident to the\r\nnature of the field service as it then was, in which little affairs\r\nthe soldier above mentioned had lost many a \"bunkie,\" there had gone\r\non for some time, under the McKinley-Taft peace-at-any-price policy,\r\nwhose keynote was that no American should have a job a Filipino could\r\nfill, much appointing to municipal and other offices of Filipinos,\r\nmany of whom had at once set to work to make their new offices useful\r\nto the cause of their country by systematic aid to the ambuscade\r\nbusiness. With this and the Balangiga massacre ever in mind, the\r\nmen of General Bell's brigade began their work in Batangas in a mood\r\nwhich quite made for fidelity in performance of orders to \"make living\r\nunbearable\" for the Filipino \"by acts, not words.\" Also, the American\r\nsoldier can sing, sometimes very badly, but often rather irrepressibly,\r\nuntil stopped by his officer. Also, whether justly or unjustly is\r\nbeside the question, he considers a politician who pets the enemy\r\nin the midst of a war a hypocrite. So General Bell's 2500 men began\r\nthat Batangas campaign on New Year's Day, 1902, giving preference,\r\nout of their repertoire, to a campaign song whose ominous chorus ran:\r\n\r\n\r\n            \"He may be a brother of William H. Taft\r\n            But he ain't no friend of mine,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nand between songs they would say purringly to one another, \"Remember\r\nBalangiga.\" And their commanding officer was the very incarnation of\r\nthis feeling. So listen to the stride of his seven-league boots and\r\nthe ring of his iron heel:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I expect to first clean out the wide Looboo Peninsula. I shall then\r\n    move command to the vicinity of Lake Taal, and sweep the country\r\n    westward to the ocean and south of Cavite, returning through\r\n    Lipa. I shall scour and clean up the Lipa mountains. Swinging\r\n    northward, the country in the vicinity of [here follows a long\r\n    list of towns] will be scoured, ending at [a named mountain],\r\n    which will then be thoroughly searched and devastated. Swinging\r\n    back to the right, the same treatment will be given all the\r\n    country of which [two named mountains] are the main peaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so on ad libitum. General Bell's course in Batangas was commended\r\nin the annual report of his immediate superior, a very humane, as\r\nwell as gallant, soldier, General Wheaton, as \"a model in suppressing\r\ninsurrections under like circumstances.\" [398] The Batangas programme\r\nwas approved by General Chaffee, the commanding general. In 1902 the\r\nUnited States Senate rang with indiscriminate denunciation of the\r\nBatangas severities and the Samar \"kill and burn\" orders. I tried\r\nin 1903, without success, to satisfy my distinguished and beloved\r\nfellow-townsman, Senator Bacon, that at the time it was adopted it\r\nhad become a military necessity, which it had. The fact was that the\r\nMcKinley-Taft policy of conciliation, intended to gild the rivets of\r\nalien domination and cure the desire for independence by coddling,\r\nhad loaned aid and comfort to the enemy, by creating, among a people\r\nused theretofore solely to force as a governmental agency for making\r\nsovereignty respected, the pathetic notion that we were afraid of them,\r\nand might be weakening in respect to our declared programme of denying\r\nthem independence. The Bell opinion of the Commission's confidence in\r\nFilipino gladness at its advent among them is sufficiently apparent in\r\nhis orders to his troops. On May 23, 1902, Senator Bacon read in the\r\nSenate a letter from an officer of the army, a West Point graduate and\r\na personal friend of the Senator's, whose name he withheld, but for\r\nwhose veracity he vouched, which letter alluded to \"a reconcentrado,\r\npen with a dead line outside, beyond which everything living is\r\nshot\"; spoke of \"this corpse-carcass stench wafted in\" (to where the\r\nletter-writer sat writing) as making it \"slightly unpleasant here,\"\r\nand made your flesh crawl thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At nightfall clouds of vampire bats softly swirl out on their\r\n    orgies over the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis does not sound to me like Batangas and Bell. It sounds like\r\nSmith and Samar. There were about 100,000 people, all told, gathered\r\nin the reconcentrado camps in Batangas under General Bell, [399]\r\nand they were handled as efficiently as General Funston handled\r\nmatters after the San Francisco fire. There was no starvation in\r\nthose camps. All the reconcentrados had to do was not to cross the\r\ndead line of the reconcentration zone, and to draw their rations,\r\nwhich were provided as religiously as any ordinary American who is\r\nnot a fiend and has plenty of rice on hand for the purpose will give\r\nit to the hungry. The reconcentrado camps and the people in them were\r\ndaily looked after by medical officers of the American army. General\r\nBell's active campaigning began in Batangas January 1, 1902, Malvar\r\nsurrendered April 16 thereafter, and Batangas was thoroughly purged\r\nof insurrectos and the like by July. During this period the total of\r\ninsurgents killed was only 163, and wounded 209; and 3626 insurgents\r\nsurrendered. [400]\r\n\r\nThe truth is General Bell's \"bark\" was much worse than his\r\n\"bite.\" The inestimable value of what he did in Batangas in 1901-02\r\nlay in convincing the Filipinos once and for all that we were not\r\nas impotent as the civil-government coddling had led them quite\r\nnaturally, but very foolishly, to think we were. Reference was\r\nmade above to the fact that the population of Batangas in 1899 was\r\n312,192, and in 1903, 257,715. Those figures were inserted at the\r\noutset to make General Bell's \"bark\" sound louder, but now that we\r\nare considering his \"bite\"--how many lives his Batangas lesson to\r\nthe Filipino people cost--another bit of testimony is tremendously\r\nrelevant. On December 18, 1901, the Provincial Secretary of Batangas\r\nProvince reported to Governor Taft that the mortality in Batangas due\r\nto war, pestilence, and famine \"has reduced to a little over 200,000\r\nthe more than 300,000 inhabitants which in former years the province\r\nhad.\" [401] Considering that General Bell's 1901-'02 campaign in that\r\nill-fated province cost outright but 163 killed,--how many of the 209\r\nwounded recovered does not appear; they may have all recovered--the\r\nBell programme in Batangas was indeed a very tender model, from\r\nthe humanitarian stand-point, of civilizing with a Krag, a model of\r\n\"suppressing insurrection under like circumstances.\" But it was never\r\nagain followed. It had made too much noise at home. Senator Bacon's\r\n\"corpse-carcass stench\" from supposed reconcentrado pens and his\r\n\"clouds of vampire bats softly swirling on their orgies over the\r\ndead,\" so vividly reminded our people of why they had driven Spain\r\nout of Cuba, that the Administration became apprehensive. Until the\r\nnoise about the Batangas business, our people had been led by Governor\r\nTaft and President Roosevelt to believe that the Filipinos were most\r\nsobbingly in love with \"a benign civil government\" and had forgotten\r\nall about independence. It was obvious that a repetition of such a\r\ncampaign in any other province might create in the public mind at home\r\na disgust with the whole Philippine policy which would be heard at\r\nthe polls in the next presidential election. So the Batangas affair\r\nmade it certain that the army was not going to be ordered out again\r\nin the Philippines before said next presidential election, at least;\r\nwhatever castigation might be deemed advisable thereafter.\r\n\r\nIt was intimated above that Senator Bacon's army friend's \"clouds of\r\nvampire bats softly swirling\" over the corpses of reconcentrados, were\r\ndoing said swirling not over Batangas at all, but over Samar. Any man\r\nfamiliar with the lay of the land in the two provinces can see from\r\nthe letter that it was written from Samar. Moreover, Colonel Wagner\r\nafterwards testified before the Senate Committee of 1902 [402] that\r\nif there had been any great mortality in the reconcentration camps\r\nin Batangas, he would have known of it. He inspected practically\r\nall those Batangas camps. Nobody who was in the islands at the time\r\ndoubts but what such conditions may have obtained in some places\r\nunder General Smith in Samar, or believes for a moment that any such\r\nconditions would have been tolerated under General Bell. General Bell\r\nhas that aversion to either causing or witnessing needless suffering,\r\nwhich you almost invariably find in men who are both constitutionally\r\nbrave and temperamentally generous and considerate of others. But the\r\nmoral sought to be pointed here is not that the Bell reconcentration\r\nin Batangas was as merciful as the Smith performances in Samar were\r\nhellish, but that, in all matters concerning the Philippines, the army,\r\nas in the case of Senator Bacon's friend, is gagged by operation of\r\nlaw, and its enforced silence is peculiarly an asset in the hands of\r\nthe party in power seeking to continue in power, in a distant colonial\r\nenterprise. Senator Bacon withheld his friend's name, because for an\r\narmy officer to tell the truth about the Philippines would be likely\r\nto get him into trouble with the President of the United States. The\r\nPresident, be it remembered, is also the leader of the political party\r\nto which he belongs. That is why the country has never been able to\r\nget any light from those who know the most about the Philippines and\r\nthe wisdom or unwisdom of keeping them, viz., the army. In 1898 this\r\nrepublic was beguiled into abandonment of the faiths of the founders\r\nand started after a gold brick, thinking it was a Klondyke. Then and\r\never since, the most important and material witnesses concerning the\r\nwisdom or unwisdom of keeping the brick, viz., the army,--which best\r\nof all knows the rank folly of it--have been gagged by operation\r\nof law. All republics that have heretofore become monarchies, have\r\nbecome so through manipulation of the army by men in power seeking\r\nto continue in power. We should either resign our expensive kingship\r\nover the Philippines or get a king for the whole business, and be\r\ndone with it. We have some ready-made coronet initials in T. R. [403]\r\n\r\n\"On June 23, 1902,\" says General Chaffee, in his report for that year,\r\n[404] \"by Act No. 421 of the Philippine Commission, so much of Act\r\nNo. 173, of July 17, 1901, as transferred the province of Batangas\r\nto military control was revoked. Civil government was re-established\r\nin the province at 12 o'clock noon, July 4, 1902.\" The rest of the\r\n1,748,573 people herein above mentioned as constituting the population\r\nof Batangas, Cebu, Bohol, Laguna, Tayabas, and Samar, were also in\r\nturn made to \"want peace and want it badly,\" and on July 4, 1902,\r\nPresident Roosevelt issued his proclamation declaring that a state of\r\ngeneral and complete peace existed. This is the famous proclamation\r\nin which he congratulated General Chaffee and the officers and men of\r\nhis command on \"a total of more than 2000 combats, great and small,\"\r\nmost of them subsequent to the Taft roseate cablegrams of 1900,\r\nand the still more roseate reports of 1901 from the same source. The\r\nproclamation appeared in the Philippines as General Orders No. 66,\r\nAdjutant General's Office, Washington, dated July 4, 1902. [405]\r\nIt directed, in the body of it, that it be \"read aloud at parade in\r\nevery military post.\" It thanked the officers and enlisted men of the\r\narmy in the Philippines, in the name of the President of the United\r\nStates, for the courage and fortitude, the indomitable spirit and loyal\r\ndevotion with which they had been fighting up to that time, alluded\r\nto the impliedly lamb-like or turn-the-other-cheek way in which they\r\nhad been behaving (no special reference is made either to Batangas,\r\nSamar, or the water-cure), and closes with a bully Rooseveltian\r\nwar-whoop about the \"more than 2000 combats, great and small,\" above\r\nmentioned. It also referred to how, \"with admirable good temper and\r\nloyalty to American ideals its (the army's) commanding generals have\r\njoined with the civilian agents of the government\" in the work of\r\nsuperinducing allegiance to American sovereignty. This document is\r\none of the most remarkable state papers of that most remarkable of\r\nmen, ex-President Roosevelt, in its evidences of ability to mould\r\npowerful discordant elements to his will. It put everybody in a good\r\nhumor. And yet, read at every military post, it served notice on the\r\nmilitary that if they knew which side their bread was buttered on,\r\nthey had better forget everything they knew tending to show the\r\nprematurity of the setting-up of the civil government, sheath all\r\ntomahawks and scalping knives they might have whetted and waiting\r\nfor Governor Taft's exit from office, abstain from chatty letters to\r\nUnited States Senators telling tales out of school, such as the one\r\nSenator Bacon had read on the floor of the Senate (already noticed),\r\nand dutifully perceive, in the future, that the war was ended, as\r\nofficially announced in the proclamation itself.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Philippine Commission for 1902, declares that the\r\ninsurrection \"as an organized attempt to subvert the authority of\r\nthe United States\" is over (p. 3). They then proceed, with evident\r\nsincerity, to describe the popularity of themselves and their\r\npolicies with the same curious blindness you sometimes find in\r\nyour Congressional district, in the type of man who thinks he could\r\nbe elected to Congress \"in a walk\" if he should only announce his\r\ncandidacy, when as a matter of fact, the great majority of the people\r\nof his district are, for some notorious reason connected with his\r\npast history among them,--say his war record--very much prejudiced\r\nagainst him. They repeat one of their favorite sentiments about the\r\nwhole country--always except \"as hereinafter excepted\"--being now\r\nengaged in enjoying civil government. But they casually admit also that\r\n\"much remains to be done\" in suppressing lawlessness and disturbances,\r\nso as to perfect and accentuate said \"enjoyment.\"\r\n\r\nLet us see just what the state of the country was in this regard\r\naccording to their own showing. They say:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The six years of war to which these islands have been subjected\r\n    have naturally created a class of restless men utterly lacking\r\n    in habits of industry, taught to live and prey upon the country\r\n    for their support by the confiscation of food supplies as a\r\n    war measure, and regarding the duties of a laborer as dull and\r\n    impossible for one who has tasted the excitement of a guerrilla\r\n    life. Even to the man anxious to return to agricultural pursuits,\r\n    the conditions existing present no temptation. By the war\r\n    and by the rinderpest, chiefly the latter, the carabaos, or\r\n    water-buffaloes, have been reduced to ten per cent. of their\r\n    former number.\r\n\r\n\r\nThink of the condition of a country, any country, but especially one\r\nwhose wealth is almost wholly agricultural, which has just had nine\r\ntenths of its plow animals absolutely swept off the face of the earth\r\nby war and its immediate consequences. The report proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The chief food of the common people of these islands is rice,\r\n    and the carabao is the indispensable instrument of the people in\r\n    the cultivation of rice,\r\n\r\n\r\nadding also that the carabao is the chief means of transportation\r\nof the tobacco, hemp, and other crops to market, and that the few\r\nremaining carabaos, the ordinary price of which in normal Spanish\r\ntimes had been $10 was now $100. Then, after completing a faithful\r\npicture of supremely thorough desolation such as the Islands had never\r\nseen since they first rose out of the sea, certainly not during the\r\nsleepy, easy-going Spanish rule, they say: \"The Filipino people of\r\nthe better class have received the passage of the Philippine Act with\r\ngreat satisfaction\"--meaning the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, the\r\nPhilippine Government Act. Gott im Himmel! What did the people care\r\nabout paper constitutions concerning benevolent assimilation? What they\r\nwere interested in was food and safety, not politics; food, raiment,\r\nshelter, and efficient police protection from the brigandage which\r\nimmediately follows in the wake of all war, not details as to what we\r\nwere going to do with the bleeding and prostrate body politic. But\r\nthe Commission had started out to govern the Filipino people on a\r\ndefinite theory,--apparently on the idea that if Americans wore white\r\nduck and no brass buttons, in lieu of khaki and brass buttons, the\r\nFilipinos would at once forget the war and be happy with an exceeding\r\ngreat happiness. Now the real situation was this. The Islands had not\r\nyet been thoroughly beaten into submission. Northern Luzon had been\r\nconquered. The lake region of Southern Luzon had been conquered. The\r\nmost important of the Visayan Islands had been conquered. But the\r\nextreme southern portion of Luzon, the enormously rich hemp peninsula\r\nalready described in a former chapter, and the adjoining hemp island of\r\nSamar, were still seething with sedition which later broke out. All\r\nthrough the winter of 1900-01 General MacArthur had tried to get\r\nMr. Root to let him close the hemp ports. But some powerful influence\r\nat Washington had prevented the grant of this permission. On January 9,\r\n1901, General MacArthur had wired Mr. Root:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hemp in southern Luzon in same relation to present struggle as\r\n    cotton during rebellion. [406]\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing doing. General MacArthur must worry along with the\r\n\"blockade-runners\" as best he could, no matter how much hemp money\r\nmight be poured into the insurgent coffers. So that in the latter\r\npart of 1902, although the more respectable of the insurgent leaders\r\nhad then surrendered, even in the hemp country, the flames of public\r\ndisorder, which had flickered for a spell after the Batangas lesson,\r\nbroke out anew in the province of Albay, and in parts of Sorsogon,\r\nthe two provinces of the hemp peninsula having the best sea-ports. The\r\nman at the head of this Albay insurrection was a sorry scamp of some\r\nshrewdness by the name of Simeon Ola, with whom I afterwards had an\r\ninteresting and in some respects most amusing acquaintance. But that\r\nis another story. I have simply brought the whole archipelago abreast\r\nof the close of 1902, relatively to public order. In this way only\r\nmay the insurrections in Albay and elsewhere in 1902-03, described\r\nin the chapter which follows, be understood in their relation to a\r\ncomprehensive view of the American occupation from the beginning,\r\nand not be regarded as \"a local issue\" like General Hancock's tariff,\r\nhaving no general political significance. In this way only may those\r\ninsurrections be understood in their true relation to the history of\r\npublic order in the Islands. The Commission always represented all\r\ndisturbances after 1902 as matters of mere banditti, such as have\r\nbeen chronic for generations in Calabria or the Transcaucasus, wholly\r\ndistinct from, instead of being an inevitable political sequel of,\r\nthe years of continuous warfare which had preceded. Their benevolent\r\nobsession was that the desire of the Philippine people for independence\r\nwas wholly and happily eradicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR TAFT, 1903\r\n\r\n                            Me miserable! Which way shall I fly?\r\n\r\n                                                          Paradise Lost.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout the last year of Governor Taft's administration in the\r\nPhilippines, 1903, both he, and the peaceably inclined Filipinos in\r\nthe disturbed districts, were between the devil and the deep sea. The\r\nmilitary handling of the Batangas and Samar disorders of 1901-2 had\r\nprecipitated in the United States Senate a storm of criticism, at\r\nthe hands of Senator Bacon and others, which had reminded a public,\r\nalready satiated with slaughtering a weaker Christian people they had\r\nnever seen in the interest of supposed trade expansion, of \"the days\r\nwhen Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres, and when,\r\nbefore a senate which still retained some show of freedom, Tacitus\r\nthundered against the oppressor of Africa.\" [407] He did not want to\r\norder out the military again if he could help it, and this relegated\r\nhim to his native municipal police and constabulary, experimental\r\noutfits of doubtful loyalty, [408] and, at best, wholly inadequate, as\r\nit afterwards turned out, [409] for the maintenance of public order and\r\nfor affording to the peaceably inclined people that sort of security\r\nfor life and property, and that protection against semi-political as\r\nwell as unmitigated brigandage, which would comport with the dignity\r\nof this nation. The better class of Filipinos, though not so enamored\r\nof American rule as Governor Taft fondly believed, had by 1903 about\r\nresigned themselves to the inevitable, and would have liked to see\r\nbrigandage masquerading under the name of patriotism stopped by that\r\nsort of adequate police protection which was so obviously necessary in\r\nthe disturbed and unsettled conditions naturally consequent upon many\r\nyears of war, and which they of course realized could only be afforded\r\nby the strong arm of the American army. But they knew that if the army\r\nwere ordered out, the burden of proof as to their own loyalty would\r\nat once be shifted to them, by the strenuous agents of that strenuous\r\ninstitution. The result was a sort of reign of terror for nearly a\r\nyear, in 1902-3, in the richest province of the whole archipelago,\r\nthe hemp-producing province of Albay, at the southern end of Luzon,\r\nand also in portions of the province of Misamis. These conditions had\r\nbegun in those provinces in 1902, and, not being promptly checked,\r\nbecause the army was held in leash and the constabulary were crude and\r\ninadequate, by 1903 brigandage therein was thriving like a garden of\r\nweeds. Super-solicitude concerning the possible effect of adequately\r\nvigorous governmental action in the Philippines on the fortunes of the\r\nAdministration in charge of the Federal Government at Washington, an\r\nattitude not surprising in the colonial agents of that Administration,\r\nbut which, as we have seen, had been from the beginning, as it must\r\never be, the curse of our colonial system, had rendered American\r\nsovereignty in the disturbed districts as humiliatingly impotent as\r\nsenile decadence ever rendered Spain.\r\n\r\nThe average American citizen will admit that the average American\r\nstatesman, even if he be not far-sighted, looks at least a year\r\nahead, in matters where both his personal fortunes and those of the\r\npolitical party to which he belongs are intimately related to what he\r\nmay be doing at the time. If in 1903 Governor Taft's administration\r\nof affairs in the Philippines was wholly uninfluenced by any possible\r\neffect it might have on President Roosevelt's chances for becoming an\r\nelected President in 1904, then he was a false friend and a very poor\r\nparty man as well. Assuming that he was neither, let us examine his\r\ncourse regarding the disturbances of public order in the Philippines\r\nin that year, as related to the first and most sacred duty of every\r\ngovernment, adequate protection for life and property.\r\n\r\nIn President McKinley's original instructions of April 7, 1900,\r\nto the Taft Commission, after quoting the final paragraph of the\r\narticles of capitulation of the city of Manila:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This city, its inhabitants * * * and its private property of all\r\n    descriptions * * * are hereby placed under the special safeguard\r\n    of the faith and honor of the American army;\r\n\r\n\r\nthe President had added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the Government of\r\n    the United States to give protection for property and life\r\n    * * * to all the people of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    * * * I charge this Commission to labor for the full performance\r\n    of this obligation, which concerns the honor and conscience of\r\n    their country.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will probably never again have a better man at the head of the\r\nPhilippine Government than William H. Taft. We have no higher type of\r\ncitizen in the republic to-day than the man now [410] at the head of\r\nit. In the Outlook of September 21, 1901, there appeared an article\r\non the Philippines written in the summer previous by Vice-President\r\nRoosevelt, entitled \"The First Civil Governor,\" which began as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A year ago a man of wide acquaintance both with American public\r\n    life and American public men [411] remarked that the first Governor\r\n    of the Philippines ought to combine the qualities which would make\r\n    a first-class President of the United States with the qualities\r\n    which would make a first-class Chief Justice of the United States,\r\n    and that the only man he knew who possessed all these qualities was\r\n    Judge William H. Taft, of Ohio. The statement was entirely correct.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer subscribed then, and still subscribes, to the foregoing\r\nestimate of Mr. Taft, whether Colonel Roosevelt still does or\r\nnot. Though I dissent most vigorously from more than one of President\r\nTaft's policies, and though this book is one long dissent from his\r\nchief pet policy, still it is to me an especial pleasure to do him\r\nhonor where I may, not merely because he has greatly honored me in\r\nthe past, but because my judgment approves the above estimate. Though\r\nas a party leader he is a very poor general, as Chief Magistrate of\r\nthe nation he has certainly deserved and commanded the cordial esteem\r\nof the whole country, and the respectful regard of all mankind. With\r\nthis admission freely made, if after reading what follows in this and\r\nthe next chapter, and weighing the same in the light of all that has\r\npreceded, the reader does not decide that the writer, far from being\r\nanimated by any intelligent high purpose, is merely a foolish person\r\nof the sounding-brass-and-tinkling-cymbal variety full of sound and\r\nfury signifying nothing, then he can reach but one other conclusion,\r\nviz., that colonization by a republic like ours, such as that we\r\nblundered into by purchasing the Philippines, is a case of a house\r\ndivided against itself, a case of the soul of a nation at war with\r\nthe better angels of its nature, a case where considerations of what\r\nmay be demanded by home considerations of political expediency will\r\nalways operate to the detriment of the Filipino people, and be the\r\ncontrolling factor in our government of them. And if I show that\r\nin the Philippines in 1903 Governor Taft failed properly to protect\r\nthe lives and property of peaceably inclined people, as so sacredly\r\nenjoined in the language above quoted from President McKinley's\r\noriginal instructions to him, lest \"the full performance of this\r\nobligation\" might prejudice the presidential prospects of his friend,\r\nMr. Roosevelt, and the success of the party to which they belonged,\r\nthen I will have shown that for this republic to be in the colonizing\r\nbusiness is an absolutely evil thing, and that any man who proposes\r\nany honorable way out of the conceded blunder of 1898, is entitled to\r\na hearing at the hands of the American people, because it \"concerns\r\nthe honor and conscience of their country.\"\r\n\r\nHaving tried most of the cases which arose out of the public disorders\r\nin the Philippines in 1903, and knowing from what I thus learned,\r\ntogether with what I subsequently learned which Mr. Taft knew then,\r\nthat the most serious of those disorders were very inadequately handled\r\nby native police, and constabulary, with much wholly unnecessary\r\nincidental sacrifice of life, in order to preserve the appearance of\r\n\"civil\" government and convey the impression of the state of peace\r\nthe name implied, at a time when a reign of terror due to brigandage\r\nprevailed throughout wide and populous regions in whose soil lay the\r\nriches of agricultural plenty, while the United States Army looked\r\non with a silent disgust which understood the reason, and a becoming\r\nsubordination which regretfully bowed to that reason as one which\r\nmust ever be the curse of colonization by a republic like ours, I\r\nknow whereof I shall speak, and will therefore speak neither lightly\r\nnor unadvisedly, but soberly, charitably, and in the fear of God.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection in the Philippines against American authority which\r\nbegan with the outbreak of February 4, 1899, and whose last dying\r\nembers were not finally stamped out until 1906, systematic denials\r\nby optimist officialdom to the contrary notwithstanding, had three\r\ndistinct stages:\r\n\r\n(1) The original fighting in company, battalion, and regimental\r\nformation, with the ordinary wide-flung battle line; this having\r\nterminated pursuant to a preconcerted plan early in November, 1899.\r\n\r\n(2) A period of guerrilla warfare maintained by the educated,\r\npatriotic, fighting generals, in a gradually decreasing number of\r\nprovinces, until the summer of 1902.\r\n\r\n(3) The final long drawn-out sputterings, which began to get serious\r\nin the fall of 1902, in provinces prematurely taken under the civil\r\ngovernment, and stripped of adequate military protection before things\r\nhad been given time to settle down in them to normal.\r\n\r\nThese last are the \"gardens of weeds\"--brigandage weeds--above\r\nmentioned. While the horticultural metaphor will help some, to really\r\nunderstand the case nothing so fits it as the more common illustration\r\napplied to grave public disorders having a common cause which likens\r\nsuch matters to a conflagration. The third and last stage through\r\nwhich the Philippine insurrection degenerated to final extinction\r\nis adequately and accurately described in the following extract from\r\none of the military reports of 1902:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The surrender or capture of the respectable military element left\r\n    the control of affairs and the remainder of the arms in the hands\r\n    of a lot of persons, most of them ignorant, some criminal, and\r\n    nearly all pertaining to a restless, irresponsible, unscrupulous\r\n    class of people, whose principal ambition seems to be to live\r\n    without work, and who have found it possible to so do under the\r\n    guise of patriotism. [412]\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the problem which confronted Governor Taft in 1903 as to\r\npublic order and protection of the peaceably inclined people, in the\r\ntwo main provinces hereinafter dealt with.\r\n\r\nIt is a great pity that in 1903 President Roosevelt could not have\r\ncalled in Secretary of War Root and sent for Senator Bacon, and those\r\nof the latter's colleagues whose philippics in the Senate of the year\r\nprevious against Generals Jake Smith and J. Franklin Bell had reminded\r\nan aroused nation of the days of Cicero and Verres, Tacitus and Africa,\r\netc., and had a frank talk with them somewhat after this fashion:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Gentlemen, Governor Taft has a hard job out there in the\r\n    Philippines. There is a big insurrection going on in the province\r\n    of Albay, which is the very richest province in the whole\r\n    archipelago, a province as big as the State of Delaware, [413]\r\n    having a population of about a quarter of a million people, and he\r\n    has, for police purposes, a crude outfit of native constabulary,\r\n    officered mostly by ex-enlisted men of the mustered-out American\r\n    volunteer regiments. The personnel of the officers may be weeded\r\n    out later and made a fine body of men, but just at present there\r\n    are a good many rather tough citizens among them. Moreover, as\r\n    soon as the constabulary was gotten together they were at once set\r\n    to work chasing little remnants of the insurgent army all over\r\n    the archipelago. So as yet they are as undisciplined an outfit\r\n    as you can well imagine, and have never had any opportunity to\r\n    act together in any considerable command. Moreover, hardly any\r\n    Filipinos have yet had a chance to learn much about how to shoot\r\n    a rifle. Also, they know practically nothing about the interior\r\n    economy of large commands, such as handling and distributing\r\n    rations systematically for troops and for prisoners, or doing the\r\n    same as to clothing, and nothing at all about medical care of\r\n    the wounded, or the sick, or prisoners. So you can see that to\r\n    handle this insurrection with such an outfit as this is sure to\r\n    mean trouble of one sort or another. Wholly unauthorized overtures\r\n    through officious natives, to the insurgent brigand chiefs, may,\r\n    possibly, be made, promising them immunity, when they ought to be\r\n    made an example of; and that will embarrass us in punishing them\r\n    when we do finally get them, and be an encouragement to other\r\n    cut-throats to do likewise in the future. Worst of all, you can\r\n    see that if some five hundred or a thousand of these brigands,\r\n    or insurgents, or whatever they are, suddenly surrender, the\r\n    ordinary police accommodations for housing and feeding prisoners\r\n    will be wholly inadequate; yet we will have to detain them all\r\n    until our courts can sift them and see which are the mere dumb\r\n    driven cattle and which are the mischievous fellows. Therefore,\r\n    in case of such a surrender, the nature of this constabulary\r\n    force, as I have already described it to you, makes it plain\r\n    that its inadequacy to meet the serious conditions we are now\r\n    confronted with may result in our having on our hands a series\r\n    of little Andersonville prisons that will smell to heaven. The\r\n    majority of the people of the province are really sick of the\r\n    war. Their best men have all surrendered and come in. But there\r\n    is an ignorant creature calling himself a general, by the name of\r\n    Ola, who seems to have a great deal of influence with the lawless\r\n    element that do not want to work. Ola has gathered together\r\n    nearly a thousand malcontents, who obey him implicitly. He is\r\n    terrorizing Albay province and the regions adjacent thereto,\r\n    and as the constabulary are not adequate to patrol the whole\r\n    province, the people do not know whether self-interest demands\r\n    that they should side with Ola or with us. Clearly, therefore,\r\n    this is a case for vigorous measures, if we all have a common\r\n    concern for the national honor, for the maintenance of law and\r\n    order in a territory we are supposed to be governing, and for\r\n    the proper protection of life and property there. General Bell\r\n    or somebody else ought to be sent there to comb that province\r\n    just as Bell did Batangas. But we don't want any howl about it.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point of the supposed colloquy,--I say \"colloquy,\" though\r\ntradition has it that most of President Roosevelt's \"colloquys\" with\r\nSenators were what Henry E. Davis, the Sidney Smith of Washington,\r\ncalls \"unilateral conversation\"--one can imagine the senatorial\r\nCiceros exchanging glances expressive of the unspoken thought: \"The\r\nman certainly has his nerve with him. Does he think the Senate is an\r\nannex of the White House?\" Then we can imagine President Roosevelt\r\nbending strenuously to his task with infinite tactfulness thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I put Jake Smith out of business, as you gentlemen all know, for\r\n    his inhuman methods of avenging the Balangiga massacre in Samar,\r\n    and I am just as much opposed to cruelty as any of you Senators can\r\n    be. But Bell in Batangas is an altogether different case from Smith\r\n    in Samar. All this about the odor of decomposing bodies wafted from\r\n    reconcentration camps, and \"clouds of vampire bats swirling out\r\n    on their orgies over the dead,\" that Senator Bacon's army friend,\r\n    whoever he may be, wrote the Senator, relates to Samar, and never\r\n    did have any application to Bell's methods in Batangas. Bell did\r\n    a clean job in a minimum of time and with a minimum sacrifice\r\n    of life, and, while he did have those reconcentration camps in\r\n    Batangas, he saw to it religiously that nobody starved, and that\r\n    all those people received daily medical treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the correctness of the picture of conditions presented in the\r\nabove hypothetical talk, I of course intend to be understood as\r\nvouching. If such a talk could have been had in 1903 by President\r\nRoosevelt with Senator Bacon and those of his colleagues who shared his\r\nviews, the Albay situation might have been handled creditably. But the\r\nAdministration was in no position to be frank with the Opposition. No\r\nAdministration has ever yet during the last fourteen years been in a\r\nposition to be frank with the Senate and the country concerning the\r\nsituation at any given time in the Philippines, because at any given\r\ntime there was always so much that it could not afford to re-open\r\nand explain. Mr. Root, for instance, might have been questioned too\r\nclosely as to why, when Secretary of War, he had gone around the\r\ncountry in the fall of 1900 speaking for Mr. McKinley, and talking\r\nabout \"the patient and unconsenting millions\" so anxious to be rid\r\nof \"Aguinaldo and his band of assassins,\" when at that very time his\r\n(Mr. Root's) generals in the Philippines were engaged in activities,\r\nthe magnitude of which may be inferred from a telegram sent from\r\nWashington to General Wood at Havana, asking if he could possibly\r\nspare the 10th Infantry, and adding:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Imperative that we have immediate use of every available company\r\n    that we can lay our hands on for service in the Philippines, [414]\r\n\r\n\r\nalthough at West Point in 1902 he told the cadets how nobly the army\r\nhad labored in putting down \"an insurrection of 7,000,000 people.\" No,\r\nthe Administration in 1903 simply could not afford to be frank\r\nconcerning the situation in the Philippines. I need not recapitulate\r\nhere any more of the long train of reasons why, because they have all\r\nbeen fully explained in the preceding chapters. Of course President\r\nRoosevelt had no such guilty knowledge of the facts as Mr. Root. He\r\nwas not in constant daily contact with army officers at the War\r\nDepartment, familiar with the actual situation in the Philippines,\r\nas Mr. Root was. He was simply \"sticking to Taft.\" Somewhere along\r\nabout the time the military folk in the Philippines were scoffing at\r\nthe unnecessary sacrifice of life incident to the lack of a strong\r\ngovernment, President Roosevelt had written his warm personal friend,\r\nHon. George Curry, now a member of Congress from New Mexico, who had\r\nbeen a captain in his regiment before Santiago, was then an official\r\nof the civil government of the Philippines, and later Governor of\r\nNew Mexico, by appointment of Mr. Roosevelt: \"Stick to Taft, George\"\r\nor words to that effect. Mr. Roosevelt's attitude was simply that\r\nof an intensely loyal friend of Mr. Taft who simply assumed that the\r\nPhilippine Government was not going to tolerate impotence in the matter\r\nof protecting life and property. But everybody at both ends of the line\r\nwas too deep in the mire of all the long and systematic withholding\r\nof facts from the American public which had been occurring ever since\r\n1898, and which it has been the aim of the preceding chapters to\r\nilluminate by the light since becoming available in the published\r\nofficial records of the Government. Hence, in the hypothetical\r\nconference above supposed, President Roosevelt was in no position\r\nto take any high ground. He would have had to admit that the civil\r\ngovernment of 1901 was set up too soon in order to stand by half-baked\r\nnotions dished out in 1900 by the Taft Commission in aid of his own\r\nand Mr. McKinley's campaign for the Presidency and Vice-Presidency,\r\nrespectively. In other words the truth about the Philippines from\r\nthe beginning might, and probably would, have seriously jeopardized\r\nthe Roosevelt presidential chances in 1904. So Governor Taft was left\r\nto his own resources in struggling with the problem of law and order\r\nin the Islands, intimately understanding the obvious bearing, just\r\nsuggested, of what he might do out there, on the election of 1904. What\r\nthen did Governor Taft do to meet the situation in 1903? Chronological\r\norder, as well as other considerations making for clearness, would\r\nsuggest that I begin by telling what he did not do.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1903, I was sent to the province of Surigao to try some cases\r\narising out of what has ever since been known in that out-of-the-way\r\nregion as \"the affair of March 23d\" (1903). In his annual report for\r\n1903, pages 29 and 30, in describing the Surigao affair, Governor\r\nTaft correctly states that a band of outlaws came into the town of\r\nSurigao on the day above named, killed Captain Clark, the officer\r\nin charge of the constabulary, took the constabulary's guns, while\r\nthey were all away at their mid-day meal, scattered about the town,\r\nand departed. But Mr. Taft's report disposes of the whole incident\r\nin a most casual way. As a matter of fact the gist of it was that\r\na heroic little band of Americans under Mr. Luther S. Kelly, the\r\nprovincial treasurer, an old Indian scout of the Yellowstone country,\r\nhastily gathered the seven American women then in the town, one of\r\nthem in a delicate condition, into the stone government house, and\r\nstood off those semi-civilized sensual brigands until reinforcements\r\narrived. Governor Taft's failure adequately to present the gravity of\r\nthe episode in his account of it does not argue well for the subsequent\r\nsolicitude he might feel about other American women in other remote\r\nprovinces which he was anxious to keep on his \"pacified list,\" to\r\nsay nothing of politically negligible native life therein. [415]\r\nNor does this report include any of the material facts showing the\r\nineffectiveness of the rank and file of the constabulary to cope\r\nwith the situation, or the general feeling of insecurity I found in\r\nthe province as to how far the whole population might be in sympathy\r\nwith the brigands. As a matter of fact, after that Surigao affair,\r\nGovernor Taft had to turn the army loose in the province to go and\r\nget back and restore to his constabulary the seventy-five to one\r\nhundred stand-of-arms the brigands had so rudely and impolitely taken\r\naway from them, and I held court there for a month trying the people\r\nwho were captured and brought in, with Colonel Meyer, of the 11th\r\nInfantry, one of the most thorough and able soldiers of the United\r\nStates Army, and seven hundred soldiers of his regiment acting as\r\ndeputy sheriffs, and yet all the time the province was under \"civil\"\r\ngovernment, nominally. Colonel Meyer got the men who killed Clark,\r\nand, upon due and ample proof, I hung them, but Surigao was never\r\ntaken for a day from the list of provinces enjoying \"the peace and\r\nprotection of a benign civil government.\" The writ of habeas corpus\r\nwas never suspended for a moment.\r\n\r\nIn the report above quoted from, Governor Taft remarks that if\r\nthe prompt steps he did take (he had already described the prompt\r\nsending of the military to the scene) had not been taken, \"the trouble\r\nmight have spread.\" But the Surigao affair seemed to teach the civil\r\ngovernment nothing in the matter of subsequent protection of life,\r\nnor did it lessen their persistence in relying on their constabulary\r\nfor due extension of such protection in time of need.\r\n\r\nBy June, 1903, another scheme was invented for avoiding calling on the\r\nmilitary. When you are in a foreign country building a new government\r\non the ruins of an old one, you naturally find out as much as you\r\ncan about how the old one met its problems. The Spaniards had had\r\nthe same problem in their day about not ordering out the military,\r\nbecause they did not have any military to order out. They were too poor\r\nto garrison the various provinces. They had long followed the plan,\r\nfrom time to time, of reconcentrating in the main towns of disturbed\r\ndistricts all the country population they could get to come in, and\r\nthen acting on the assumption that all who did not come in were public\r\nenemies. This meant that when the country people came in, they simply\r\nlooked out for themselves, while away from their homes, and farms,\r\nas best they could. Of course nobody at all looked after the farms,\r\nand nobody provided medical attention for the reconcentrados, or\r\nsanitary attention for the reconcentration camps. This general plan\r\nwas formally sanctioned by the Commission, in so far as the following\r\nlaw sanctioned it. The law was enacted, June 1, 1903. It is section\r\n6, of Act 781, which was an act dealing with all the constabulary\r\nproblems, of which this was one. It read:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In provinces which are infested to such an extent with ladrones or\r\n    outlaws that the lives and property of residents in the outlying\r\n    barrios [416] are rendered wholly insecure by continued predatory\r\n    raids--\r\n\r\n\r\nthink of permitting a country to get into any such condition when you\r\nhave an abundance of American troops on hand available to prevent it--\r\n\r\n\r\n    and such outlying barrios thus furnish to the ladrones or outlaws\r\n    their sources of food supply, and it is not possible with the\r\n    available police forces constantly to provide protection to\r\n    such barrios--\r\n\r\n\r\nthere being all the time \"available police forces,\" in the shape\r\nof regular troops, amply able to handle these unsettled conditions,\r\nwhich were the inevitable aftermath of lawlessness consequent on five\r\nor six years of guerrilla warfare--\r\n\r\n\r\n    it shall be within the power of the Governor-General, upon\r\n    resolution of the Philippine Commission, to authorize the\r\n    provincial governor to order that the residents of such outlying\r\n    barrios be temporarily brought--\r\n\r\n\r\nobserve the length of time this may last is not limited--\r\n\r\n\r\n    within stated proximity to the poblacion, or larger barrios, of\r\n    the municipality, there to remain until the necessity for such\r\n    order ceases to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo house and ration the reconcentrados, the following provision is\r\nmade by the statute we are considering:\r\n\r\n\r\n    During such temporary residence, it shall be the duty of the\r\n    provincial board, out of provincial funds, to furnish such\r\n    sustenance and shelter as may be needed to prevent suffering\r\n    among the residents of the barrios thus withdrawn.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe act also provides that during the course of the reconcentration,\r\nwhere the province does not happen to have the necessary ready\r\ncash, it may apply to the Commission, in distant Manila, for an\r\nappropriation to meet the emergency. What is to be done with those\r\nwho starve during the temporary deficit, it does not say. If you\r\nmust have reconcentration, to leave it to such agencies as the above,\r\nwith the native police and constabulary as understudies, in lieu of\r\navailing yourself of the superb equipment of the American army, with\r\nall its facilities for handling great masses of people, as they did,\r\nfor instance, after the San Francisco fire, is like preferring the\r\nMulligan Guards to the Cold-stream Guards. Furthermore, there is no\r\nescape from the logic of the fact that reconcentration is essentially\r\na war measure. The difference between what is lawful in war and what\r\nis lawful in peace is not a technical one. In war the innocent must\r\noften suffer with the guilty. In peace the theory at least is that\r\nonly the guilty suffer. Hence it is that our Constitution is so\r\njealous that in time of peace no man's life, liberty, or property,\r\nshall be taken from him without \"due process of law,\" a provision\r\nwhich becomes inoperative in war times, being superseded by martial\r\nlaw. I know that the early question, \"Does the Constitution follow\r\nthe flag?\" was answered by the Supreme Court of the United States in\r\nthe negative as to the Philippines. But the Act of Congress of July\r\n1, 1902, under which we were governing the Philippines in 1903,\r\nand still govern them, known as the Philippine Government Act,\r\nextended to the Islands all the provisions of the Bill of Rights of\r\nour Constitution except the right of jury trial and the individual\r\nright to go armed--\"bear arms.\" It specifically said in section 5:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No law shall be enacted in said Islands which shall deprive any\r\n    person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt hardly needs argument to show that to bundle the rural population\r\nof a whole district out of house and home, and make them come to town\r\nto live indefinitely on such public charity as may drain through the\r\nitching fingers of impecunious town officials, abandoning meantime\r\ntheir growing crops, and the household effects they cannot bring with\r\nthem, is depriving people of their property, and restraining them\r\nof their liberty, without due process of law. In fact, in 1905, in\r\nthe case of Barcelon vs. Baker, vol. v., Philippine Report, page 116,\r\nduring an insurrection in Batangas, to control which, the presidential\r\nelection of 1904 being then safely over, the writ of habeas corpus\r\nhad been suspended and martial law declared, the Supreme Court of the\r\nPhilippines held that detention of people as reconcentrados under\r\nsuch circumstances \"for the purpose of protecting them\" was not an\r\nillegal restraint of their liberty, because the ordinary law had been\r\nsuspended. This decision held it to be both the prerogative and the\r\nduty of the Governor-General to suspend the writ of habeas corpus\r\nwhen the public safety so required.\r\n\r\nI refuse to believe for a moment that President Taft, the former\r\nwise and just judge, in whom is now vested by law the mighty power\r\nof filling vacancies on the highest court in this great country of\r\nours, will seriously contend that that reconcentration law is not in\r\ndirect violation of the above quoted section of the Act of Congress\r\nof July 1, 1902, for the government of the Philippines, and therefore\r\nnull and void. The truth is, it was a piece of careless legislation,\r\ndealing with conditions that were essentially war conditions, under\r\na government which was forever vowing that peace conditions existed,\r\nand determined not to admit the contrary. The civil government was\r\nlike Lot's wife. It could not look back.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress of 1902 had made the usual provision permitting\r\nthe governor to declare martial law in a given locality in his\r\ndiscretion. But the reconcentration law passed by the Philippine\r\nCommission was a way of avoiding the exercise of that authority,\r\nso as to keep up the appearance of peace in the provinces to which\r\nit might be applied, regardless of how many lives it might cost. In\r\nits last analysis the reconcentration law was at once an admission\r\nof a duty to order out the military and a declaration of intention\r\nto neglect that duty. I suppose the eminent gentlemen who enacted\r\nit justified it on the idea of teaching the natives how to maintain\r\norder themselves by letting them stew in the dregs of their own\r\ninsurrection. Yet no one can read the Commission's own description\r\nof the widespread lawlessness which so long ran riot after the\r\nguerrilla warfare degenerated into brigandage, without seeing,\r\nfrom their own showing, how obvious was their duty to have waited,\r\noriginally, until law and order were restored, by not interfering\r\nwith the war itself until it was over, and by keeping the country\r\nproperly garrisoned for a decorous and sufficient period after it\r\nwas over, until something like real peace conditions should exist,\r\non which to begin the work of post-bellum reconstruction. After all,\r\nit all gets us back to the original pernicious programme outlined in\r\nPresident McKinley's annual message to Congress of December, 1899,\r\nwherein was announced the intention to send out the Taft Commission,\r\nwhich message also announced, in effect, that it was Mr. McKinley's\r\npurpose to begin the work of reconstruction as fast as the patient\r\nand unconsenting millions \"loyal to our rule\" should be rescued from\r\nthe clutch of the hated Tagals.\r\n\r\nRecurring again to the reconcentration law itself, the moral quality\r\nof executive action putting it in operation was not unlike that which\r\nwould attach should the Governor of Massachusetts, in lieu of ordering\r\nthe state troops to the scene of great strike riots in half a dozen\r\ntowns around Boston, issue a proclamation something like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The situation has grown so serious that your local police force,\r\n    as you see, is wholly inadequate to cope with the situation. You\r\n    will all, therefore, thrust your tooth-brushes, night-gowns,\r\n    and a change of clothing, into the family grip, and assemble\r\n    on the Boston Common and in the public gardens, there to remain\r\n    until the necessity for this order ceases to exist, and we will\r\n    there take the best care of you we can, as was done in the case\r\n    of the San Francisco fire. As governor I am unwilling to order\r\n    out the military.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf any lawyer on the Commission gave any thought at the time to the\r\nvalidity of the reconcentration law, in its relation to the \"due\r\nprocess of law\" clause of the Philippine Government Act, which none\r\nof them probably did, he must simply have justified the means by the\r\nbenevolence of the end, on the idea that he knew so much better than\r\nCongress possibly could, the needs of the local situation. But if you\r\nread this law in the light of a knowledge of its practical operation,\r\nthere is more suggestion between its lines of Senator Bacon's friend's\r\n\"corpse-carcass stench\" and \"clouds of vampire bats softly swirling\r\nout on their orgies over the dead\" than there is of benevolence. It\r\nreally was unsportsmanlike for the Commission to have entrusted\r\nreconcentration to the native police and constabulary the native\r\ngovernors had, and it was wholly indefensible for them to take the\r\nliberty of violating an act of Congress in order to live up to their\r\npet fiction about the war being \"entirely over.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the term of court at Surigao in the month of May, 1903, I was\r\nsent to Misamis province, where I remained until September, handling an\r\ninsurrection down there. This province also was nominally in a state of\r\npeace, i.e., there was no formal recognition of the existence of the\r\ninsurrection by suspension of the writ of habeas corpus. Curiously\r\nenough, as I wrote Governor Taft afterwards, the Misamis crowd of\r\ndisturbers of the peace were genuine insurrectos. Their movement\r\nwas not so formidable as the Ola insurrection in Albay I dealt with\r\nlater, but they were by no means unmitigated cut-throats. I have often\r\nwondered how they managed to be so respectable at that late date. They\r\ndid not steal, as did most of the outlaws of 1903. Their avowed\r\npurpose was to subvert the existing government. The use of this word\r\n\"insurrection\" in connection with these various disturbances recalls\r\na pertinent incident. In 1904 there was a vacancy on the Supreme Bench\r\nof the Islands. Some of my friends, members of the bar of my district,\r\ngot up a petition to the then Governor-General setting forth in most\r\npartial terms my alleged qualifications for the place. Now in the\r\nPhilippines, in the candor of informal social intercourse, all of\r\nus always called a spade a spade, i.e., we called an insurrection an\r\ninsurrection, instead of referring to the disturbance in the guarded\r\nand euphemistic terms which you find in all the official reports\r\nintended for home consumption. So in their petition, these gentlemen\r\nrecited, among my other supposed qualifications, that I had held\r\ncourt in three different provinces \"during insurrections in the same.\"\r\n\r\nThe Albay insurrection was the worst one I had to deal with during\r\nGovernor Taft's administration as Governor of the Philippines. This\r\nwas the insurrection headed by Simeon Ola. The first appearance of\r\nthis man Ola in the official reports of the Philippine Government in\r\nconnection with the Albay disturbances of 1902-3 is in the report\r\nof the colonel commanding the constabulary for the district which\r\nincluded Albay, Col. H. H. Bandholtz, dated June 30, 1903. [417] This\r\nreport contains a sort of diary of events for the year preceding the\r\ndate of it. An entry for October 28, 1902, begins:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Early this month negotiations were opened with Simeon Ola, chief\r\n    of the ladrones in this province, with a view of inducing him\r\n    to surrender.\r\n\r\n\r\nThink of this great government negotiating with the leader of a band\r\nof thieves who were openly and flagrantly defying its authority! The\r\nentry proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    After many promises and conferences extending over a period of\r\n    forty days, during which hostilities were suspended, Ola broke\r\n    off negotiations and withdrew his entire force and a large number\r\n    of additional recruits that he had secured during the armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore Ola finally surrendered he is supposed to have had a total\r\ncommand ranging at various times from a thousand to 1500 men. And I\r\nthink Colonel Bandholtz must have had in the field opposed to him,\r\nfirst and last, at least an equal number of native forces. Ola also\r\nmakes an official reappearance in the report of the Governor of Albay\r\nProvince for 1904. [418] It there appears that reconcentration was\r\nbegun in Albay as part of the campaign against Ola and his forces, in\r\nMarch, 1903, and continued until the end of October of that year. Says\r\nthis report of the Governor of Albay concerning reconcentration:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Naturally, the effect of this unusual volume of persons in a\r\n    limited area was disease and suffering for want of food and\r\n    ordinary living accommodations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Governor does not say how large the \"unusual volume of persons\"\r\nwas that was herded into the reconcentration zones, nor does he\r\nfurnish any mortality statistics. Nobody kept any. How much there was\r\nof the awful mortality and \"clouds of vampire bats softly swirling\r\nout on their orgies over the dead,\" that Senator Bacon's army friend\r\ncorrespondent encountered in Samar does not affirmatively appear. The\r\nnumber of people affected by reconcentration in Albay and an adjacent\r\nprovince that caught the contagion of unrest and had to be given\r\nsimilar treatment, was about 300,000. [419]\r\n\r\nIn his report for 1903, in describing the Ola insurrection of 1902-3,\r\nGovernor Taft says: \"A reign of terror was inaugurated throughout\r\nthe province.\" He then goes on to state that to meet it he applied\r\nthe reconcentration tactics. In the same report he describes what\r\nis to my mind the most humiliating incident connected with the\r\nwhole history of the American Government in the Philippines, viz.,\r\nVice-Governor Wright's visit to Albay in 1903, apparently in pursuance\r\nof the peace-at-any-price policy that the Manila Government was\r\nbent on. Governor Taft says of the civil government's dealings with\r\nHis Excellency, the Honorable Simeon Ola, the chief of the brigands,\r\nthat General Wright and Dr. Pardo de Tavera, a Filipino member of the\r\nCommission, went down to Albay and \"talked to the people,\" the idea\r\napparently being that those poor unarmed or ill-armed creatures should\r\ngo after the brigands. This was to avoid ordering out the military,\r\nand summarily putting a stop to the reign of terror as became the\r\ndignity of this nation. I think these talks had something to do with\r\nthe origin of the charge afterwards made that immunity was promised\r\nOla and the men who finally did surrender with him. Of course General\r\nWright made no such promises. But the idea got out in the province\r\nthat the word was, \"Get the guns,\" the inference being that if Ola\r\nand his people would come in and surrender their guns they would be\r\nlightly dealt with. In his book Our Philippine Problem, Professor\r\nWillis, at page 140, gives what purports to be an agreement signed\r\nby Colonel Bandholtz, dated September 22, 1903, whereby Bandholtz\r\npromises Ola immunity, and also promises a number of other things\r\nwhich are on their face rankly preposterous. Ola was much on the\r\nwitness stand before me during that term of court, and, everything\r\n\"came out in the wash.\" He was represented by competent, intelligent,\r\nand fearless Filipino counsel, and they did not suggest the existence\r\nof any such document. No proof of any offer of immunity was adduced\r\nbefore me. I think Ola simply finally decided to throw himself on\r\nthe mercy of the government, on the idea that there would be more joy\r\nover the one sinner that repenteth than over the ninety and nine that\r\nare already saved. He was probably as much afraid that Governor Taft\r\nwould order out the military as the wretched pacificos were that he\r\nwould not. He immediately turned state's evidence against all the men\r\nunder him of whose individual actings and doings he had any knowledge,\r\nthe prosecuting attorney making, with my full approval, a promise\r\nto ask executive clemency as a reward. This was in keeping with the\r\npractice in like cases customary in all jurisdictions throughout the\r\nEnglish-speaking world.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of the Ola insurrection may be somewhat appreciated\r\nfrom the financial loss it occasioned. Says Governor Taft, in his\r\nreport for 1903:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Governor [of Albay] estimates that hemp production and sale\r\n    have been interfered with to the extent of some ten to twelve\r\n    millions of dollars Mexican [which is equivalent to five or six\r\n    million dollars American money]. [420]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the population of the province was about 250,000, [421] a loss\r\nof $5,000,000 meant a loss of $20 per capita for the six months or\r\nso of reconcentration during which the farms were neglected. This\r\nwould be equivalent to a loss of $1,800,000,000, in the same length\r\nof time to a country having a population of 90,000,000, which is the\r\ntotal population figure for the United States according to the Census\r\nof 1910.\r\n\r\nIt was in the latter part of October, 1903, I believe, that Ola finally\r\nsurrendered with some five hundred or six hundred men. I was sent to\r\nAlbay about the middle of November, to assist the regular judge of\r\nthe district, Hon. Adam C. Carson, now one of the justices of the\r\nSupreme Court of the Philippines, in disposing of the case arising\r\nout of the Ola performances. Conditions at the time were also very\r\nmuch perturbed in various neighboring and other provinces, and the\r\ncourts and constabulary were kept very busy.\r\n\r\nAn incident recurs to memory just here which illustrates the state of\r\npublic order. But before relating it a decent respect to the opinions\r\nof the reader requires me to state my own attitude toward that whole\r\nsituation at the time. I am perfectly clear in my own mind that as\r\nsociety stands at present, capital punishment is a necessary part of\r\nany sensible scheme for its protection. I have no compunction about\r\nhanging any man for the lawless taking of the life of another. We owe\r\nit to the community as a measure of protection to your life and mine\r\nand all others. So far as public order was concerned in the country\r\nnow under consideration in 1903, the \"civil\" government was simply a\r\nwell-meaning sham, a military government with a civil name to it. When\r\nthe constabulary would get in the various brigands, cut-throats, etc.,\r\nwho might be terrorizing a given district, some of them masquerading as\r\npatriots, others not even doing that, the courts would try them. None\r\nof the judges cared anything about any particular brigand in any\r\ngiven case except to find out how many, if any, murders, rapes,\r\narsons, etc., he had committed during the particular reign of terror\r\nof which he had been a part. Wherever specific murders were proven,\r\nthe punishment would always be \"a life for a life.\" And you have no\r\nidea how absolutely wanton some of the murders were, and how cruelly\r\nsome of the young women, daughters of the farmers, were maltreated\r\nafter they were carried off to the mountains. I would hate to try to\r\nguess how much more of this sort of thing would have had to occur in\r\nAlbay in 1903 than did occur, to have moved Governor Taft to deprive\r\nAlbay of \"the protection of a benign civil government\"--one of the pet\r\nexpressions of contemporaneous official literature--and say the word\r\nto the army to take hold of the situation and give the people decent\r\nprotection. But to come to the incident above broached. Shortly after I\r\nreached Albay, and set to work to hold Part II. of the district court,\r\nwhile my colleague, Judge Carson, held Part I. we had a call from a\r\nthird judge, Judge Linebarger, of Chicago, who was on his way to some\r\nother perturbed region. I think that by that time, late in November,\r\n1903, Governor Taft must have known he was soon to leave the Islands to\r\nbecome Secretary of War, and therefore was anxious to be able to make\r\nthe best showing possible, in his farewell annual report as Governor,\r\nas to the \"tranquillity\" conditions. At any rate Judge Linebarger\r\ncame to see us, for a few hours, his ship having touched en route at\r\nthe port near the provincial capital of Albay. Judge Carson had had a\r\ngallows erected near the public square of the town, for the execution\r\nof some brigand he had convicted, whether it was for maltreating some\r\npoor farmer's daughter until she died, or burying an American alive,\r\nor what, I do not now recollect. But in going around the town some\r\none suggested, as we passed this gallows, that we go up on it to\r\nget the view. So we went--the three of us. Then each looked at the\r\nother and all thought of the work ahead. Then Judge Carson smiled\r\nand dispelled the momentary sombreness by repeating with grim humor,\r\nan old Latin quotation he happened to remember from his college days\r\nat the University of Virginia: Haec olim meminisse juvabit (\"It will\r\nbe pleasant to remember these things hereafter\").\r\n\r\nThe Ola insurrection had continued from October, 1902, to October,\r\n1903, without suspension of civil government. During that period the\r\njail had been filled far beyond its reasonable capacity most of the\r\ntime. It sometimes had contained many hundreds. As to the sanitary\r\nconditions, in passing the jail building one day in company with\r\none of the provincial officials, he remarked to me, nonchalantly:\r\n\"It's equivalent to a death sentence to put a man in that jail.\" I\r\nafterwards found out that this was no joke. During most of my visit\r\nto the province I was too busy holding court and separating the sheep\r\nfrom the goats, to think much of anything else. But toward the close of\r\nthe term, after Christmas, after Governor Taft had left the Islands\r\nand gone home to be Secretary of War, an incident happened that\r\nproduced a profound impression on me, suggested a new view-point,\r\nand started troubled doubts as to whether the whole Benevolent\r\nAssimilation business was not a mistake born of a union of avarice\r\nand piety in which avarice predominated--doubts which certain events\r\nof the following year, hereinafter related, converted in conviction\r\nthat any decent kind of government of Filipinos by Filipinos would\r\nbe better for all concerned than any government we could give them,\r\nhampered as we always will be by the ever-present necessity to argue\r\nthat government against the consent of the governed is not altogether\r\nwrong, and that taxation without representation may be a blessing in\r\ndisguise. The Yule-tide incident above alluded to was this. Most of\r\nthe docket having been disposed of, and there being a lull between\r\nChristmas and New Year's day which afforded time for matters more or\r\nless perfunctory in their nature, the prosecuting attorney brought in\r\nrough drafts of two proposed orders for the court to sign. One was\r\nheaded with a list of fifty-seven names, the other with a list of\r\nsixty-three names. Both orders recited that \"the foregoing\" persons\r\nhad died in the jail--all but one between May 20 and Dec. 3. 1903\r\n(roughly six and one-half months) as will appear from an examination\r\nof the dates of death--and concluded by directing that the indictments\r\nbe quashed. The writer was only holding an extraordinary term of court\r\nthere in Albay, and was about to leave the province to take charge\r\nof another district to which Governor Taft had assigned him before\r\nleaving the Islands. The newly appointed regular judge of the district,\r\nJudge Trent, now of the Philippine Supreme Court, was scheduled soon\r\nto arrive. Therefore the writer did not sign the proposed orders\r\nbut kept them as legal curios. A correct translation of one of them\r\nappears below, followed by the list of names which headed the other\r\n(identical) order:\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PHILIPPINE ISLANDS, EIGHTH\r\n    JUDICIAL DISTRICT\r\n\r\n    In the Court of First Instance of Albay\r\n\r\n    The United States against\r\n\r\n    Cornelio Rigorosa              died December    3, 1903\r\n    Fabian Basques                 died September  25, 1903\r\n    Julian Nacion                  died October    14, 1903\r\n    Francisco Rigorosa             died October    18, 1903\r\n    Anacleto Solano                died November   25, 1903\r\n    Valentin Cesillano             died November    6, 1903\r\n    Felix Sasutona                 died September  26, 1903\r\n    Marcelo de los Santos          died June        3, 1903\r\n    Marcelo Patingo                died November   15, 1903\r\n    Julian Raynante                died September   7, 1903\r\n    Dionisio Carifiaga             died October     4, 1903\r\n    Felipe Navor                   died September  17, 1903\r\n    Luis Nicol                     died November   23, 1903\r\n    Balbino Nicol                  died September  23, 1903\r\n    Damiano Nicol                  died November   23, 1903\r\n    Leoncio Salbaburo              died November   20, 1903\r\n    Catalino Sideria               died July       25, 1903\r\n    Marcelo Ariola                 died October    26, 1903\r\n    Francisco Cao                  died November   26, 1903\r\n    Martin Olaguer                 died November   13, 1903\r\n    Juan Neric                     died November   16, 1903\r\n    Eufemio Bere                   died November   21, 1903\r\n    Julian Sotero                  died October    30, 1902\r\n    Juan Payadan                   died September  10, 1903\r\n    Benedicto Milla                died July       30, 1903\r\n    Placido Porlage                died June       13, 1903\r\n    Gaudencio Oguita               died October    11, 1903\r\n    Alberto Cabrera                died September   8, 1903\r\n    Julian Payadan                 died August      4, 1903\r\n    Eusebio Payadan                died August     10, 1903\r\n    Leonardo Rebusi                died November    2, 1903\r\n    Julian Riobaldis               died October     2, 1903\r\n    Victor Riobaldis               died October    23, 1903\r\n    Mauricio Balbin                died September  27, 1903\r\n    Tomas Rigador                  died July       23, 1903\r\n    Miguel de los Santos           died July       28, 1903\r\n    Eustaquio Mapula               died November   18, 1903\r\n    Eugenio Lomibao                died November    1, 1903\r\n    Francisco Luna                 died August      7, 1903\r\n    Gregorio Sierte                died October    31, 1903\r\n    Teodoro Patingo                died November   21, 1903\r\n    Teodorico Tua                  died September  23, 1903\r\n    Ceferino Octia                 died November   10, 1903\r\n    Graciona Pamplona              died September  12, 1903\r\n    Felipe Bonifacio               died November   26, 1903\r\n    Baltazer Bundi                 died October    12, 1903\r\n    Julian Locot                   died October    13, 1903\r\n    Francisco de Punta             died August     20, 1903\r\n    Pedro Madrid                   died August     24, 1903\r\n    Felipe Pusiquit                died July       17, 1903\r\n    Rufo Mansalan                  died July       14, 1903\r\n    Ignacio Titano                 died June       20, 1903\r\n    Alfonso Locot                  died June       29, 1903\r\n    Gil Locot                      died May        23, 1903\r\n    Regino Bitarra                 died September   7, 1903\r\n    Bonifacio Bo                   died August      2, 1903\r\n    Francisco de Belen             died September  29, 1903\r\n\r\n\r\n    DECREE\r\n\r\n    The defendants above named, charged with divers crimes, having\r\n    died in the provincial jail by reason of various ailments, upon\r\n    various dates, according to official report of the jailer, it is\r\n\r\n    ORDERED BY THIS COURT, That the cases pending against the said\r\n    deceased persons be, and the same are hereby, quashed, the costs\r\n    to be charged against the government.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Judge of the Twelfth District acting in the Eighth.\r\n\r\n    Albay, December 28, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing order contains fifty-seven names.

James L. Slayden, of Texas, in the Congressional\r\nRecord for February 12, 1907. There can be little doubt that President\r\nTaft saw the article, and that if it had contained any inaccuracies\r\nthey would long since have been noticed. So that in the Albay jail in\r\n1903 we had a sort of Andersonville prison, or Black Hole of Calcutta,\r\non a small scale.\r\n\r\nIf the military authorities had had charge of the Albay insurrection\r\nand of the prisoners in the Albay jail in 1903, it is safe to say\r\nthat the great majority of those who died would have lived. But to\r\nhave ordered out the troops would have been to abandon the official\r\nfiction that there was peace.\r\n\r\nOf Ola's five or six hundred men, Judge Carson and I, assisted by\r\nthe chief prosecuting attorney of the government, Hon. James Ross,\r\nturned several hundred loose. Another large batch were disposed of\r\nunder a vagrancy law, which allowed us to put them to work on the\r\nroads of the provinces for not exceeding two years, usually six to\r\ntwelve months. Most of the remainder, a few score, we tried under the\r\nsedition law, and sent to Bilibid, the central penitentary at Manila,\r\nfor terms commensurate with their individual conduct and deeds. The\r\nmore serious cases were sent up for longer terms under the brigandage\r\nlaw. We indulged in no more maudlin sentiment about those precious\r\nscamps who had been degrading Filipino patriotism by occasionally\r\ninvoking its name in the course of a long season of preying upon\r\ntheir respectable fellow-countrymen than Aguinaldo or Juan Cailles\r\nwould have indulged. I am quite sure that either Aguinaldo or Juan\r\nCailles would have made much shorter shrift of the whole bunch than\r\nJudge Carson and I did. It was only the men shown to have committed\r\ncrimes usually punished capitally in this country that we sentenced\r\nto death--a dozen or more, all told. Ola was the star witness for the\r\nstate. He held back nothing that would aid the prosecuting attorney\r\nto convict the men who had followed him for a year. He was given a\r\nsentence of thirty years (by Judge Carson), as a sort of expression\r\nof opinion of the most Christian attitude possible concerning his\r\nreal deserts, but his services as state's evidence entitled him to\r\nimmunity, and for that very good and sufficient reason Judge Carson,\r\nProsecuting Attorney Ross, and myself so recommended to the Governor.\r\n\r\nOla could read and write after a fashion, though he was quite an\r\nignorant man. But to show what his control must have been over the\r\nrank and file of his men, let one incident suffice. On the boat going\r\nup to Manila from Albay, after the term of court was over, Ola was\r\naboard, en route for the penitentiary. But, as he was a prospective\r\nrecipient of executive clemency, though the guards kept an eye on him,\r\nhe was allowed the freedom of the ship. One night on the voyage up,\r\nthe weather being extremely warm, I left my stateroom sometime after\r\nmidnight, carrying blanket and pillow, and went back to the storm\r\nsteering-gear at the stern of the ship, to spend the rest of the night\r\nmore comfortably. Waking sometime afterward for some unassignable\r\ncause, I realized that the crown of another head was tangent to the\r\ncrown of my own, and occupying part of my pillow. It was Ola, the\r\nchief of the brigands. I raised up, shook the intruder, and said:\r\n\"Hello, Ola, what are you doing here?\" He wakened slowly. He had no\r\nidea of any first-class passenger being back there, and had taken\r\nit for granted that I was one of the ship's crew, when he decided to\r\nshare my pillow. As soon as he realized who I was, he sprang to his\r\nfeet with profound and effusive apologies, and paced the deck until\r\nmorning, perhaps thinking over the possible effect of the incident\r\non my recommendation concerning himself.\r\n\r\nAfter I had recovered the use of all my pillow I went back to\r\nsleep for a spell. About dawn I was wakened by some of the guards\r\nchattering. But I heard Ola, who had apparently been keeping watch\r\nover my august slumbers in the meantime, say in an imperious tone to\r\nthe guards, his keepers, \"Hush, the judge is sleeping.\" They looked\r\nat the brigand chief, and cowed, obeyed.\r\n\r\nOla was pardoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR TAFT, 1903 (Continued)\r\n\r\n                            The Philippines for the Filipinos.\r\n\r\n                                                Speech of Governor Taft.\r\n\r\n\r\nJust before Governor Taft left the Islands in 1903, he made a speech\r\nwhich made him immensely popular with the Filipinos and immensely\r\nunpopular with the Americans. The key-note of the speech was \"The\r\nPhilippines for the Filipinos.\" The Filipinos interpreted it to\r\nmean for them that ultimate independence was not so far in the dim\r\ndistance of what is to happen after all the living are dead as to\r\nbe a purely academic matter. And there was absolutely nothing in\r\nthe speech to negative that idea, although he must have known how\r\nthe great majority of the Filipinos would interpret the speech. On\r\nthe other hand, the Americans in the Islands, popularity with whom\r\nwas then and there a negligible factor, interpreted the speech,\r\nnot inaccurately, to mean for them: \"If you white men out here, not\r\nconnected with the Government, you Americans, British, Germans and\r\nSpaniards, and the rest of you, do not like the way I am running this\r\ncountry, why, the boats have not quit running between here and your\r\nrespective homes.\" [422] Then he came back to the United States and\r\nhas ever since been urging American capital to go to the Philippines,\r\nall the time opposing any declaration by the law-making power of the\r\nGovernment which will let the American who goes out there know \"where\r\nhe is at,\" i.e., whether we are or are not going to keep the Islands\r\npermanently, and how to formulate his earthly plans accordingly, though\r\nthe educated Filipinos are concurrently permitted to clamor against\r\nAmerican \"exploitation,\" American rule, and Americans generally,\r\nand to keep alive among the masses of their people what they call\r\n\"the spirit of liberty,\" and what the insular government calls the\r\nspirit of \"irreconcilableness.\" Clearly, a policy which makes for race\r\nfriction and race hatred is essentially soft-headed, not soft-hearted,\r\nand ought not to be permitted to continue. Yet it has been true for\r\ntwelve years, as one of President Taft's admiring friends proudly\r\nboasted concerning him some time since:\r\n\r\n\r\n    One man virtually holds in his keeping the American conscience\r\n    with the regard to the Philippines. [423]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is true, and it is not as it should be. We should either stop\r\nthe clamor, or stop the American capital and energy from going to\r\nthe Islands. After an American goes out to the Islands, invests his\r\nmoney there, and casts his fortunes there, unless he is a renegade,\r\nhe sticks to his own people out there. Then the Taft policy steps in\r\nand bullyrags him into what he calls \"knuckling to the Filipinos,\"\r\nevery time he shows any contumacious dissent from the Taft decision\r\nreversing the verdict of all racial history--which has been up to\r\ndate, that wheresoever white men dwell in any considerable numbers\r\nin the same country with Asiatics or Africans, the white man will\r\nrule. Yet the American in the Philippines, once he is beguiled into\r\ngoing there, must bow to the Taft policies. He has taken his family to\r\nthe Islands, and all his worldly interests are there. Yet he is living\r\nunder a despotism, a benevolent despotism, it is true, so long as the\r\nnon-office-holding American does not openly oppose the government's\r\npolicies, but one which, however benevolent, is, so far as regards any\r\nbrooking of opposition from any one outside the government hierarchy,\r\nas absolute as any of the other despotic governments of Asia. Though\r\nthe Governor of the Philippines does not wear as much gilt braid\r\nas some of his fellow potentates on the mainland of Asia, still,\r\nin all executive matters he wields a power quite as immediate and\r\nsubstantial, in its operation on his subjects, as any of his royal\r\ncolleagues. It never for a moment occurs either to the American\r\nGovernment official in the Philippines, or to the American citizen\r\nengaged in private business there who is in entire accord with the\r\npolicies of the insular government and on terms of friendship with\r\nthe officials, that the government under which he is living is any\r\nmore of a despotism than the Government of the United States. The\r\nshoe never pinches the American citizen engaged in private business\r\nuntil he begins, for one reason or another, to be \"at outs\" with the\r\ninsular government, and to have \"opinions\" which--American-like--he\r\nat once wants to express. If he permits himself to get thoroughly\r\nout of accord with the powers that be, the sooner he gets out of the\r\nIslands the better for him. This is the most notorious single fact\r\nin the present situation. There is no public opinion to help such a\r\nperson, in any case where he differs with any specific act or policy\r\nof the insular government. The American colony is comparatively small,\r\nsay between ten and twenty thousand all told, outside the army (which\r\nconsists of ten or twelve thousand individuals living wholly apart\r\nfrom the rest of the community). The doctor who is known to have\r\nthe patronage of high government officials is sure of professional\r\nsuccess, and his wife is sure to receive the social recognition her\r\nhusband's position in the community naturally commands; and this\r\npermits her to make auspicious entrance into the game of playing at\r\nprecedence with her next neighbor called \"society,\" so dear to the\r\nhearts of many otherwise sensible and estimable women--to say nothing\r\nof carpet knights, callow youths, cads, and aging gourmands. Also\r\nif the doctor and his lady have adult children, their opportunities\r\nto marry well are multiplied by the sunlight from the seats of the\r\nmighty. Thus the doctor and his wife are a standing lesson to the man\r\n\"with convictions\" that yearn for utterance, but who is also blessed\r\nwith a discreet helpmate, more concerned in the general welfare and\r\nhappiness of all the family than in seeing her husband's name in\r\nthe paper. What is true of the doctor is also true of the lawyer\r\nknown to be persona grata to the government. Again, the newspaper\r\nman in favor with the government is sure to get his share of the\r\ngovernment advertising, according to a very liberal construction,\r\nand that insures his being able to command reportorial and editorial\r\ntalent such as will sell his paper, and the consequent circulation is\r\nsure to get him the advertising patronage of the mercantile community,\r\nthus placing success for him on a solid, comfortable basis. Also, a\r\ncontrary course will, slowly, maybe, but surely, freeze out any rash\r\ncompetitor. Consequently, the American in the Philippines is deprived\r\nof one of his most precious home pleasures, viz., letting off steam,\r\nin some opposition paper, about the real or imagined shortcomings of\r\nthe men in charge of the government. For the reasonable expectancy\r\nof life of an opposition paper in Manila is pathetically brief. The\r\nhapless editor on the prosperous paper, whatever his talents,\r\nwho happens to become afflicted with \"views\" which he airs in his\r\neditorial columns, is soon upbraided by his friends at his club as\r\n\"getting cranky,\" and is told by the orthodox old-timers among them,\r\n\"John, you've been out here too long. You better go home.\" If he does\r\nnot change his tone, the receipts of the advertising department of his\r\npaper soon fall off, and his friend, the more tactful proprietor, who\r\n\"knows how to get along with people,\" is not long in agreeing with\r\nthe rest of his friends that he has \"been out here too long.\" Again\r\nthe successful merchant has too many interests at stake in which he\r\nneeds the cordial friendship of the government to be able to afford\r\nto antagonize it. And so on, through every walk of life, the influence\r\nof the government permeates every nook and corner of the situation.\r\n\r\nThe average public man in the United States would not feel \"nat'ral\"\r\nunless intermittently bedewed with steam from the exhaust valve of\r\nthe soul of some \"outraged citizen,\" through the medium of the public\r\npress. But in the Philippines a public man occupying a conspicuous\r\nposition with the government may be very generally detested and\r\nactually not know it. [424] The American in the Philippines, with\r\nall his home connections severed, might as well send his family to\r\nthe poor-house at once as to come out in a paper with an interview or\r\nspeech,--even supposing any paper would publish it--which, copied by\r\nthe papers back in the United States, would embarrass the National\r\nAdministration's Philippine policy in any way. The same applies to\r\ntalking too freely for the newspapers when home on a visit.\r\n\r\nI think the foregoing makes sufficiently obvious the inherent\r\nimpossibility of the American people ever knowing anything about\r\ncurrent governmental mistakes in the Philippines, of which there\r\nmust be some, in time for their judgment to have anything to do with\r\nshaping the course of the government out there for which they are\r\nresponsible. And therefore it shows the inherent unfitness of their\r\ngovernmental machinery to govern the Filipinos so long as they do not\r\nchange the home form of government to meet the needs of the colonial\r\nsituation, by providing a method of invoking the public judgment on\r\na single issue, as in the case of monarchical ministries, instead of\r\nlumping issues as we now do. It is certainly a shame that the fate and\r\nfuture of the Philippines are to-day dependent upon issues as wholly\r\nforeign to anything Philippine as is the price of cheese in Kamchatka\r\nor the price of wool in the United States. Whether the Filipinos are\r\nfit for self-government or not, under our present form of government\r\nwe are certainly wholly unfit to govern them. In our government of\r\nthe Filipinos, the nature of the case eliminates our most valuable\r\ngovernmental asset, to wit, that saving grace of public opinion\r\nwhich stops public men, none of whom are infallible, before they can\r\naccomplish irreparable mischief, through uncorrected faith in plans of\r\nquestionable wisdom and righteousness to which their minds are made up.\r\n\r\nTo show how absolute was the executive and legislative power over\r\n8,000,000 of people entrusted by the sole authority of President\r\nMcKinley to Governor Taft--without consulting Congress, though\r\nafterwards the authority so conferred was ratified by Congress and\r\ndescended from Governor Taft to his successor--an incident related\r\nto me in the freedom of social intercourse, and not in the least\r\nin confidence, by my late beloved friend Arthur W. Fergusson,\r\nlong Executive Secretary to Governor Taft, will suffice. In 1901\r\nthe Commission had passed a law providing for the constitution of\r\nthe Philippine judiciary, [425] according to which law an American,\r\nin order to be eligible to appointment as a Judge of First Instance\r\n(the ordinary trial court, or nisi prius court, of Anglo-Saxon\r\njurisprudence) must be more than thirty years old, and must have\r\npractised law in the United States for a period of five years before\r\nappointed. In 1903 President Roosevelt wanted to make Hon. Beekman\r\nWinthrop (then under thirty years of age) now (1912), Assistant\r\nSecretary of the Navy, a Judge of First Instance. Governor Taft called\r\nFergusson in and said: \"Fergy, make me out a commission for Beekman\r\nWinthrop as a Judge of First Instance.\" Fergusson said: \"You can't do\r\nit, Governor. It's against the law. He's not old enough.\" Winthrop was\r\na graduate of the Harvard Law School. Governor Taft said humorously,\r\n\"I can't eh? I'll show you. Send me a stenographer.\" A law was dictated\r\n[426] striking out thirty years and inserting twenty-five, and adding\r\nafter the words \"must have practised law for a period of five years\"\r\nthe words \"or be a graduate of a reputable law school.\" Fergusson\r\nwas then called in, and told to go down the hall, see the other\r\ncommissioners, [427] and get them together, which he did, and\r\nthe law was passed in a few minutes. Then Fergusson was sent for,\r\nand the Governor said, handing him the new \"law\"; \"Now make out\r\nthat commission.\" Even if Fergusson colored the incident up a bit,\r\nin the exercise of his inimitable artistic capacity to make anything\r\ninteresting, his story was certainly substantially correct relatively\r\nto the absoluteness of the authority of the Governor, as will appear\r\nby reference to the two laws cited.\r\n\r\nIt is only fair to say that Winthrop made a very good judge. There\r\nused to be current in the Philippines a story that Governor Taft\r\nhad said, in more or less humorous vein: \"Gentlemen, I'm somewhat\r\nof an expert on judges. What you need in a judge is\"--counting with\r\nthe index finger of one hand on the fingers of the other--\"firstly,\r\nintegrity; secondly, courage; thirdly, common sense; and fourthly,\r\nhe must know a little law.\" Winthrop's integrity, courage, and common\r\nsense were beyond all question. It could hardly have been otherwise. He\r\ncame of a long line of sturdy and distinguished men, the first of whom\r\nhad come over in the Mayflower days to the Massachusetts coast. And,\r\nhe did know a little law. But the manner of his appointment is none\r\nthe less illustrative of how much quicker, Governor Taft could make\r\nand publish a law than any of his fellow despots [428] over on the\r\nmainland of Asia, considering how slow-moving all their various grand\r\nviziers were, compared with Fergy, and his corps of stenographers.\r\n\r\nHaving now given, I hope, a more or less sympathetic insight into\r\nwhat absolute rulers our governors in the Philippines have been, in\r\nthe very nature of the case, from the beginning, let us observe the\r\nchange of tone of the government, after the reign of the first ended,\r\nand the reign of the second began.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR WRIGHT--1904\r\n\r\n                                The blame of those ye better\r\n                                The hate of those ye guard.\r\n\r\n                                           Kipling's White Man's Burden.\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft left the Philippines on or about December 23, 1903,\r\nto become Secretary of War in President Roosevelt's Cabinet, and\r\nshortly afterward Vice-Governor Luke E. Wright succeeded to the\r\ngovernorship. After the accession of Governor Wright, there was\r\nno more hammering it into the American business men having money\r\ninvested in the Islands that the Filipino was their \"little brown\r\nbrother,\" for whom no sacrifice, however sublime, would be more\r\nthan was expected. Governor Wright was quite unpopular with the\r\nFilipinos and immensely popular with the Americans and Europeans,\r\nbecause, soon after he came into power, he \"let the cat out of the\r\nbag,\" by letting the Filipinos know plainly that they might just as\r\nwell shut up talking about independence for the present, so far as\r\nhe was advised and believed; in other words, that Governor Taft's\r\n\"Philippines for the Filipinos\" need not cause any specially billowy\r\nsighs of joy just yet, because it had no reference to any Filipinos\r\nnow able to sigh, but only to unborn Filipinos who might sigh in\r\nsome remote future generation; and that the slogan which had caused\r\nthem all to want to sob simultaneously for joy on the broad chest\r\nof Governor Taft was merely a case of an amiable unwillingness to\r\ntell them an unpleasant truth, viz., that in his opinion they were\r\nwholly unfit for self-government--all of which, in effect, meant\r\nthat Governor Taft had been merely \"Keeping the word of promise to\r\nthe ear and breaking it to the hope.\"\r\n\r\nThe Wright plain talk made the Filipinos one and all feel:\r\n\"Alackaday! Our true friend has departed.\" But as Secretary of War\r\nTaft, after four years more of trying to please both sides, at home, at\r\nlast frankly told the Filipinos when he went out to attend the opening\r\nof the first Philippine legislature, in 1907, practically just what\r\nGovernor Wright had begun to tell them from the moment his predecessor\r\nhad exchanged the parting tear with them on the water-front at Manila\r\nin 1903, the net result of the Wright policy of uncompromising honesty\r\non the present political situation, may easily be guessed.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wright's method of repudiating the Taft straddle took for its\r\nkey-note, in lieu of \"The Philippines for the Filipinos,\" the slogan\r\n\"An Equal Chance for All.\" What Governor Wright meant was merely that\r\nthere would be no more browbeating of Americans to make them love\r\ntheir little brown brother as much as Governor Taft was supposed\r\nto love him, but that everybody would be treated absolutely alike\r\nand nobody coddled. However, the Filipinos of course knew that they\r\ncould not compete with American wealth and energy, and so did the\r\nAmericans in the islands. So what the Wright slogan, unquestionably\r\nfair as was its intent, inexorably meant to everybody concerned except\r\nthe dignified, straightforward and candid propounder of it, was, in\r\neffect, the British \"White Man's Burden\" or Trust-for-Civilization\r\ntheory, a theory whereunder the white man who wants some one else's\r\nland goes and takes it on the idea that he can put it to better\r\nuse than the owner. Thus early did the original \"jollying\" Mr. Taft\r\nhad given them become transparent to his little brown brother. Thus\r\nearly did it become clear to the Filipinos that behind the mask of\r\nexecutive protestations that they shall some day have independence\r\nwhen fit for it, lurks a set determination industriously to earn for\r\nan indeterminate number of generations yet to come\r\n\r\n\r\n                The blame of those ye better\r\n                The hate of those ye guard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book has been written, up to this point, in vain, if the\r\npreceding chapters have not made clear how much political expediency,\r\nlooking to the welfare of a party in power naturally seeking to\r\ncontinue in power, necessarily dominates Philippine affairs under\r\nAmerican rule. We have observed under the microscope of history,\r\nmade available by the official documents now accessible, the long\r\nbattle between the political expediency germ and the independence\r\nbug which began in General Anderson's dealings with Aguinaldo and\r\ncontinued through General Merritt's and General Otis's regimes. We\r\nhave seen General MacArthur's attempt at a wise surgical operation\r\nto excise the independence bug from the Philippine body politic--so\r\nthat the expediency germ might die a natural death from having nothing\r\nto feed on. We have seen that operation interfered with by the Taft\r\nCommission during the presidential campaign of 1900, because the men\r\nin control of the republic could not ignore considerations of political\r\nexpediency; and we saw the consequent premature setting up of the civil\r\ngovernment in 1901, with all its dire consequences in the then as yet\r\nunconquered parts of the archipelago, southern Luzon, and some of the\r\nVisayan Islands. We have observed the effective though heroic local\r\ntreatment administered to the Philippine body politic by General Bell\r\nin Batangas in 1901-2, with a view of killing off the independence\r\nbug there. We have seen the fierce struggle between some of the bug's\r\nbelated spawn and the expediency germ's now more emboldened forces\r\nin Albay in the off year, 1903. We are now to take our fifth year's\r\ncourse in the colonial department of politico-entomological research,\r\nthe presidential year 1904.\r\n\r\nIt was the way the Samar insurrection of 1904-5-6 was handled which\r\nfinally convinced me that the Filipinos would not kill any more of\r\neach other in a hundred years than we have killed, or permitted to\r\nbe killed, of them, in the fell process of Benevolent Assimilation.\r\n\r\nAmerican imperialism is not honest, like the British variety. American\r\nimperialism knows that Avarice was its father, and Piety its\r\nmother, and that it takes after its father more than it does\r\nafter its mother. British imperialism frankly aims mostly to make\r\nthe survivors of its policies happy, not the people it immediately\r\noperates on. American imperialism pretends to be ministering to the\r\nhappiness of the living, and, though it realizes that it is not a\r\nsuccess in that line, it resents identification with its British\r\ncousin, by sanctimonious reference to the alleged net good it is\r\ndoing. Yet in its moments of frankness it says, with an air of infinite\r\npatience under base ingratitude, \"Well, they will be happy in some\r\nother generation,\" and that therefore the number of people we have\r\nhad or may have, to kill, or permit to be killed, in the process of\r\nBenevolent Assimilation, is wholly negligible. This is simply the old,\r\nold argument that the end justifies the means, the argument that has\r\nwrought more misery in the world than any other since time began.\r\n\r\nWhen Judge Taft, General Wright, and their colleagues of the Taft\r\nCommission, came out to the Philippines in 1900, they came full of the\r\nMcKinley convictions about a people whom neither they or Mr. McKinley\r\nhad ever seen, bound hand and foot by political necessity to square the\r\nfreeing of Cuba with the subjugation of the Philippines. A perfectly\r\nnatural evolution of this attitude resulted in the position they\r\nat once took on arriving in the Islands, viz., that to do for the\r\nFilipinos what we have done for the Cubans would mean a bloody welter\r\nof anarchy and chaos. And the presidential contest of 1900 was fought\r\nand won largely on that issue. After 1900, for all the gentlemen above\r\nreferred to, the proposition was always res adjudicata. All protests\r\nby Filipinos to the contrary caused only resentment, and welded the\r\nauthorities more and more hermetically to the correctness of the\r\noriginal proposition. Loyalty to the original ill-considered decision\r\nbecame impregnated, in their case, with a fervor not entirely unlike\r\nreligious fanaticism, and belief in it became a matter of principle,\r\njustifying all they had done, and guiding all they might thereafter\r\ndo. So that when General Wright \"came to the throne\" in our colonial\r\nempire, as Governor, and legatee of the McKinley-Taft Benevolent\r\nAssimilation policies, his attitude in all he did was thoroughly\r\nhonest, and also thoroughly British. He honestly believed in the\r\n\"bloody welter of anarchy and chaos\" proposition, and was prepared,\r\nin any emergency that might arise, to follow his convictions in that\r\nregard whithersoever they might lead, without variableness or shadow\r\nof turning. Take him all in all, Governor Wright was about the best\r\nman occupying exalted station I ever knew personally, President Taft\r\nhimself not excepted; although I still adhere to Colonel Roosevelt's\r\nopinion of 1901 concerning Mr. Taft, quoted in the chapter preceding\r\nthis, from the Outlook of September 21, 1901, notwithstanding that in\r\nthe contest for the Republican nomination for the presidency in 1912,\r\nthe Colonel \"recalled\" that opinion. Seriously, a man may \"combine the\r\nqualities which would make a first class President of the United States\r\nwith the qualities which would make a first class Chief Justice of the\r\nUnited States\" and still cut a sorry figure trying to fit a square peg\r\ninto a round hole, or a scheme of government, the breath of whose life\r\nis public opinion, into the running of a remote colonial government,\r\nthe breath of whose life is exemption from being interfered with by\r\npublic opinion.\r\n\r\nAfter the Albay insurrection of 1903 had been cleaned up, I took charge\r\nof the Twelfth Judicial District, having been appointed thereto by\r\nGovernor Taft just before he left the islands to become Secretary of\r\nWar. In those trying pioneer days they always seemed to give me the\r\ninsurrections to sift out, but it was purely fortuitous. Whenever you\r\nceased to be busy, prompt arrangements were made for you to get busy\r\nagain. Judge Ide, the Minister of Justice, wasted no government money.\r\n\r\nThe Twelfth District consisted of the two island provinces of Samar and\r\nLeyte, two of the six Visayan Islands heretofore noticed as the only\r\nones worth considering in a general view of the archipelago such as\r\nthe student of world politics wants or needs. Leyte had a population\r\nof 388,922, [429] and an area of 3008 square miles. [430] Samar's\r\npopulation was 266,237, and its area, 5276 square miles, makes it the\r\nthird largest island of the Philippine Archipelago. So that as Judge\r\nof the Twelfth District, consisting of two provinces, the Governor of\r\neach of which was ex-officio sheriff of the court for his province,\r\nI was, in a sense, a sort of shepherd of a political flock of some\r\n650,000 people, whom I always thought of as a whole as \"my\" people.\r\n\r\nSamar and Leyte are separated, where nearest together, by a most\r\npicturesque winding strait bordered with densely wooded hills. San\r\nJuanico Strait is much narrower than the inland sea of Japan at its\r\nnarrowest point, and almost as beautiful. In fact, at its narrowest\r\npoint it seems little more than a stone's throw in width. It is as\r\npretty as the prettiest part of the Golden Horn. Leyte had been put\r\nunder the Civil Government in 1901, and this premature interference\r\nwith the military authorities in the midst of their efforts to pacify\r\nthe island had had the usual result of postponing pacification, by\r\nfilling local politicians, wholly unable to comprehend a government\r\nwhich entreated or reasoned with people to do things, with the notion\r\nthat we were resorting to diplomacy in lieu of force because of fear\r\nof them. Leyte and Samar were strategically one for the insurgents,\r\njust as the provinces of the Lake district of Luzon, described in\r\nan earlier chapter, were, because they could flee by night from\r\none province to another in small boats without detection, when hard\r\npressed by the Americano. The main insurgent general in Samar, Lucban,\r\nhad surrendered to General Grant in 1902, but the cheaper fellows\r\nstayed out much longer, preying upon those who preferred daily toil\r\nto cattle-stealing and throat-cutting as a means of livelihood,\r\nand continuing the political unrest intermittently in gradually\r\ndiminishing degree, through 1903. By the spring of 1904, however,\r\nthere still remained in Samar riffraff enough, the jetsam and flotsam\r\nof the insurrection--professional outlaws--to get up some trouble,\r\nso that, as brigand chiefs, they might resume the roles of Robin\r\nHood, Jesse James, et al. During the first half of that year the\r\nopportunity these worthies had been waiting for, while resting on\r\ntheir oars, developed. The crop of municipal officials resulting from\r\nthe original McKinley plan of beginning the work of reconstruction\r\nduring, instead of after, the war, and among the potential village\r\nHampdens, instead of among the Cromwells, had resulted in some very\r\nrascally municipal officials who oppressed the poor, getting the hemp\r\nof the small farmer, when they would bring it to town, at their own\r\nprices--hemp being to Samar what cotton is to the South. From the\r\nlowland and upland farmers the ever-widening discontent spread to\r\nthe hills, where dwelt a type of people constituting only a small\r\nfraction of the total population of the Islands--\"half savage and\r\nhalf child\"--but loving their hills, and wholly indisposed, of their\r\nown initiative, to start trouble, unless manipulated. Obviously,\r\nthen, \"the public mind\" of Samar--those who know Samar will smile\r\nwith me at the phrase, but it will do, for lack of a better--was\r\nlikely soon to be in a generally inflammable condition. By July,\r\n1904, the Robin Hoods, Jesse Jameses, et al., touched the match to\r\nthe material and a political conflagration started, apparently as\r\nunguided--save by the winds of impulse--and certainly as persistent,\r\nas a forest fire. Every native of the Philippine Islands, whether\r\nhe be of the 7,000,000 Christians or of the 500,000 non-Christian\r\ntribes, is born with a highly developed social instinct either to\r\ncommand or to obey. The latter tendency is quite as common in the\r\nPhilippines as the former is in the United States. Hence the Samar\r\ndisturbances of 1904-5-6, though made up at the outset of raids and\r\ndepredations by various roving bands of outlaws yielding allegiance\r\nonly to their immediate chief, soon took on a very formidable military\r\nand political aspect. [431] The roving bands would ask the peaceably\r\ninclined people our flag was supposed to be protecting, \"Are you for\r\nus or for the Americans?\" promptly chopping their heads off if they\r\nshowed any lack of zeal in denouncing American municipal institutions\r\nand things American in general. Pursuant to Mr. McKinley's original\r\nscheme--concocted for a people he had never seen, under pressure of\r\npolitical necessity--to rig up in short order a government \"essentially\r\npopular in form,\" a lot of most pitiable municipal governments had\r\nbeen let loose on the people, a part of our series of kindergarten\r\nlessons. The plan was as wise as it will be for the Japanese--some\r\none please hold Captain Hobson while I finish the analogy--when\r\nthey conquer the United States, to go to the Bowery and the Ghetto\r\nfor mayors of all our cities. Thus by our pluperfect benevolence,\r\nwe had contrived in Samar by 1904 to rouse the highland folk, or hill\r\npeople, whom the Spaniards had always let alone, against the pacific\r\nagricultural lowland people and the dwellers in the coast villages. The\r\nlatter, or such of them as did not join the hill folk for protection,\r\nwe permitted to be mercilessly butchered by wholesale, from August to\r\nNovember, 1904, as hereinafter more fully set forth, because ordering\r\nout the army to protect them might have been construed at home to mean\r\ndisturbances more serious and widespread than actually existed, and\r\nmight therefore affect the presidential election in the United States\r\nby renewing the notion that the Administration had never been frank\r\nwith the American people concerning conditions in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Philippine Commission for 1904 is dated\r\nNovember 1st, which was just a week before the presidential election\r\nday of that year. Their annual report for 1905 is dated November 1,\r\n1905. In their report for 1904, the Commission deal with the general\r\nstate of public order in the same roseate manner which, as we have\r\nseen, had made its first appearance during the political exigencies\r\nof 1900 in the language about \"the great majority of the people\"\r\nbeing \"entirely willing\" to benevolent alien domination in lieu\r\nof independence. When Rip Van Winkle was trying to quit drinking,\r\nhe used to say after each drink: \"Oh, we'll just let that pass.\" In\r\ntheir report for 1904, the Commission swallow the conditions in Samar\r\nwith equal nonchalance. After stating that some (impliedly negligible)\r\ndisturbances had occurred in Samar \"two months since,\" they add that\r\n\"the constabulary of the province took the field\" against the bands\r\nof Pulajans, or outlaws, and that \"as a result, they were soon broken\r\nup, and are being pursued and killed or captured\" (p. 3). In their\r\nreport dated November 1, 1905, by way of preface to an account of\r\nthe extensive military operations inaugurated in Samar shortly after\r\nthe presidential election of 1904, which operations had not only\r\nbeen in progress for nearly a year on the date of the 1905 report,\r\nbut continued for more than a year thereafter, the Commission explain\r\ntheir 1904 nonchalance about Samar thus: \"It was then believed that\r\nthe constabulary forces had succeeded in checking the further progress\r\nof the outbreak\" (p. 47).\r\n\r\nLet us examine the facts on which they based this statement, since it\r\nmeant that they believed that a duly reported epidemic of massacres\r\nof peaceably inclined people, over whom the American flag was floating\r\nas a symbol of protection to life and property, had stood effectually\r\nchecked by November 1, 1904, the date of their report. And first,\r\nof the massacres themselves, their nature and extent.\r\n\r\nThe Samar massacres of 1904 began with what we all called down there\r\n\"the outbreak of July 10th.\" In August, 1904, I went to Samar to\r\nhandle the cases arising out of the disturbances there, assisted by\r\nthe (native) Governor of the province, who, under the law already\r\nalluded to, was ex-officio sheriff of the court, and an army of\r\ndeputy sheriffs, as it were, the constabulary, numbering several\r\nhundred. The outbreak of July 10th was always known afterwards as\r\n\"the Tauiran affair.\" This Tauiran affair was a raid by an outlaw\r\nband on the barrio of Tauiran, one of the hamlets of the municipal\r\njurisdiction of the township called Gandara, in the valley of the\r\nGandara River, in north central Samar, wherein one hundred houses,\r\nthe whole settlement, were burned, and twenty-one people killed. The\r\nterm of court lasted from early in August until early in November. The\r\nday after the Tauiran affair, over on the other fork of the Gandara\r\nRiver, occurred what was called \"the Cantaguic affair.\" Cantaguic was\r\na hamlet or barrio about the size of Tauiran. The brigands killed the\r\nlieutenant of police of Cantaguic and some others, but they did not\r\nkill everybody in the place. Instead, after killing a few people,\r\nthey went to the tribunal (town hall), seized the local teniente,\r\nor municipal representative of American authority, tied the American\r\nflag they found at the tribunal about the head of the teniente, turban\r\nfashion, poured kerosene oil on it, and took the teniente down stairs\r\nand out into the public square, where they lighted and burned the\r\nflag on his head, the chief of the band, one Juliano Caducoy by name,\r\nremarking to the onlookers that the act was intended as a lesson to\r\nthose serving that flag. They then cut off the lips of the teniente\r\nso he could not eat (he of course died a little later), burned the\r\nbarrio and carried off fifty of the inhabitants. Caducoy was captured\r\nsome time afterward, and I sentenced him to be hanged. There was\r\npractically no dispute about the facts. After the Cantaguic affair,\r\nduring the term of court mentioned, the provincial doctor, Dr. Cullen,\r\nan American who had been a captain doctor of volunteers, had occasion\r\nto run up to Manila. The doctor was a most accomplished gentleman,\r\nbut he had a fondness for the grewsome in description equal to Edgar\r\nAllan Poe himself. After he came back he told me about having told the\r\nGovernor-General of the Cantaguic affair, and repeated with an evident\r\npleased consciousness of his ability to make his hearer's blood curdle,\r\nhow the Governor had said to him slowly, \"Doctor, that--is--awful!\"\r\n\r\nBlood seemed to whet the appetite for slaughter. The records of the\r\nAugust-November, 1904 term of the court of first instance of Samar show\r\nall the various barrios of the Gandara Valley in flames on successive\r\ndays, after the affairs of July 10th and 11th. I do not speak from\r\nmemory, but from documents contained in a large bundle of papers\r\nkept ever since, in memory of that incarnadined epoch. You find one\r\nbarrio burned one day and another another day, until all the people\r\nof the Gandara Valley were made homeless. One of the constabulary\r\nofficers, Lieutenant Bowers, a very gallant fellow, testified before\r\nme that from July 10th to the date of his testimony, which was on or\r\nabout September 28th, some 50,000 people had been made homeless in\r\nSamar by the operations of the outlaws. I deem Lieutenant Bowers's\r\nestimate quite reasonable. His figures include only one-fifth of the\r\npopulation of an island which was in the throes of an all-pervading\r\nbrigand uprising. The conservative nature of Lieutenant Bowers's\r\nestimate concerning the mischief that had already been wrought\r\nby the end of September, 1904, and was then gathering destructive\r\npotentiality like a forest or prairie fire, may be inferred from the\r\ncontents of a memorandum appearing below, furnished me by a Spanish\r\nofficer of the constabulary, a Lieutenant Calderon, who had been an\r\nofficer of the Rural Guard in the Spanish days. It contains a list\r\nof fifty-three towns, villages, and hamlets (a barrio may be quite a\r\nvillage, sometimes even quite a town, though usually it is a hamlet)\r\nburned up to the date the memorandum was furnished me.\r\n\r\nIn order to a clear understanding of these Samar massacres and\r\ntown-burnings of 1904, as well as for general geographical purposes,\r\na few preliminary words of explanation will be appropriate just here.\r\nA province in the Philippines has heretofore been likened to a county\r\nwith us. But in the largest provinces, the subdivisions of provinces\r\ncalled municipalities are more like counties; and each municipality\r\nis in turn subdivided into sections called barrios. A municipality\r\n(Spanish, pueblo) in the Philippines is not primarily a city or town,\r\nas we understand it, i.e., a more or less continuous settlement\r\nof houses and lots more or less adjacent, but a specific area of\r\nterritory, a township, as it were. This area or territory may be 5 x\r\n10 square miles, or 10 x 20, or more, or less. For example, Samar's\r\narea is 5276 square miles. Yet it contained in 1904, and probably still\r\ncontains, only twenty-five townships or municipalities all told, each\r\nmunicipality being subdivided in turn into barrios. Municipalities\r\nin the Philippines vary in size as much as counties do with us, and\r\ntheir total area accounts for and represents the total area of the\r\nprovince, just as the total area of the counties of a State represents\r\nwith us the total area of the State. The seat of government of the\r\nmunicipality always bears the same name as the municipality itself,\r\njust as the county seat of a county usually, or frequently, bears\r\nthe same name as the county, with us. Take for instance, the name of\r\nthe first municipality or township in the list which appears below,\r\nGandara. The municipality of Gandara might be described by analogy\r\nas the \"county\" of Gandara, the list of barrios burned as a list of\r\ntowns and villages of the \"county\" of Gandara.\r\n\r\nThe municipality of Gandara included a watershed in north central Samar\r\nfrom which the Gandara River flowed in a southwesterly direction to\r\nthe sea. Within this watershed, parallel 12 1/2 north of the equator\r\nintersects the 125th meridian of longitude east of Greenwich. Northern\r\nSamar is a very rich hemp country, Catarman hemp being usually quoted\r\nhigher than any hemp listed on the London market. If you stand at the\r\nhighest point of the Gandara watershed you can see four streams flowing\r\noff north, northwest, northeast, and southwest to the sea. There are\r\nsome half dozen streams having their source there. Brigands making\r\ntheir headquarters there could always, when hard pressed, get away\r\nin canoes toward the sea in almost any direction they wished. The\r\nfollowing is Lieutenant Calderon's list:\r\n\r\n\r\n    RELACION POR MUNICIPIOS DE LOS BARRIOS QUEMADOS.\r\n\r\n    (List by Municipalities of the Barrios Burned.)\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF GANDARA\r\n\r\n    Tauiran                    July 10\r\n    Cantaguic                  July 12\r\n    Cauilan                    July 13\r\n    Erenas                     July 16\r\n    Blanca Aurora              July 19\r\n    Bulao [432]                July 21\r\n    Pizarro                  August  8\r\n    Cagibabago               August  8\r\n    Nueva                    August 10\r\n    Hernandez                August 10\r\n    San Miguel               August 10\r\n    Buao                     August 15\r\n    El Cano                  August 17\r\n    San Enrique              August 20\r\n    San Luis                 August 25\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF CATBALOGAN\r\n\r\n    (Calderon's List of Barrios Burned, continued)\r\n\r\n    Malino                   July   31\r\n    Silanga                  August  9\r\n    Ginga                    August 13\r\n    San Fernando             August 15\r\n    Maragadin                August 20\r\n    Talinga                  August 21\r\n    Santa Cruz               August 22\r\n    Dap-dap                  August 29\r\n    Palencia                 August 31\r\n    Albalate           (date not given)\r\n    Villa Hermosa      (date not given)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above list of villages burned in the township of Catbalogan\r\nshows how bold the Pulajans had then grown. By that time they were\r\ncommitting depredations, robbery, murder, and town-burning, in all the\r\nvarious villages within the municipal jurisdiction of the township\r\nof Catbalogan, coming often within a few miles of the town proper\r\nof Catbalogan itself, the seat of the provincial government. In the\r\nattack on Silanga, which occurred August 9th, a number of people\r\nwere killed. Silanga was but little more than an hour's walk from\r\nthe court-house at Catbalogan. The Governor at once wired Manila\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        Catbalogan, Samar, Aug. 9, 1904.\r\n\r\n    Executive Secretary, Manila:\r\n\r\n    The peaceably inclined people of the barrios near here are\r\n    collecting here in large numbers, terrorized by Pulajans who are\r\n    boldly roaming the country, burning barrios within seven or eight\r\n    miles from Catbalogan. They kill men, women, and children without\r\n    distinction. These Pulajans have fled from Gandara where they are\r\n    being actively pursued by constabulary. All forces that could be\r\n    spared have gone out. We have about thirty available fighting\r\n    men here. Pulajans liable at any time to enter Catbalogan. We\r\n    are in danger of some occurrence quite as serious as the Surigao\r\n    affair. [433] There are buildings here which I must protect at all\r\n    hazards--Treasury, Provincial Jail with ninety-five prisoners, and\r\n    commissary and ordnance stores of constabulary. We need at once at\r\n    least three hundred men, scouts if possible, to handle situation,\r\n    between here and Gandara. Pulajans undoubtedly have friends in\r\n    Catbalogan. I suspect certain of the municipal authorities here. I\r\n    estimate number of Pulajans now operating at about five hundred.\r\n\r\n        (Signed) Feito, Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn September 2d, the Provincial Governor of Samar sent to Manila the\r\nfollowing telegram:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                              Catbalogan, Sept. 2, 1904.\r\n\r\n    Carpenter, Actg. Ex. Secy., Palace, Manila:\r\n\r\n    Seven-thirty this evening simultaneous reports from north\r\n    and south sides of town Pulajans approaching. They have not\r\n    entered yet and may not, but have gathered Americans with wives\r\n    and children in my house. Arms supplied. Treasury twenty-five\r\n    thousand Conant. [434] One hundred forty prisoners in jail. Only\r\n    forty-seven constabulary here. If Pulajans enter much needless\r\n    sacrifice life pacific citizens here. Feel sure Pulajans have\r\n    friends in Catbalogan. Request company either scouts or soldiers\r\n    from Calbayog stationed here, preferably former. Their presence\r\n    guarantee stability.\r\n\r\n        (Signed) Feito, Governor.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Governor Feito did not call for the regular army of the\r\nUnited States. His job, poor devil, was to demonstrate as best he\r\ncould that the military were not needed. He would at once have been\r\nsuspected of trying to scuttle the ship of \"benign civil government\"\r\nif he had admitted that the regular army was needed. But to return\r\nto Calderon's list:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF CALBAYOG [435]\r\n\r\n    (Calderon's List of Barrios Burned, continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Ylo                       August 17\r\n    Napuro                    August 17\r\n    Balud                     August 17\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF WRIGHT\r\n\r\n    (Calderon's List of Barrios Burned, continued)\r\n\r\n    Guinica-an                  July 25\r\n    Calapi                      July 28\r\n    Bonga                      August 4\r\n    Tutubigan                 August 19\r\n    Motiong                 September 1\r\n    Lau-an                   October 10\r\n    Sao Jose           (date not given)\r\n\r\n\r\nA sample of the distressing communications I was getting as these\r\nmassacres progressed is the notification of the Motiong affair\r\nof September 1st set forth below, which I give as a type of the\r\nmethodical stoicism of those bloody times. Motiong was seven miles\r\ndown the coast road from Catbalogan:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the district of Motiong, municipality of Wright, province of\r\n    Samar, Philippine Islands, September 1, 1904.\r\n\r\n    In the presence of the undersigned Peregrin Albano, member of\r\n    the village council, there being also present the president of\r\n    the Municipal Board of Health, Mr. Tomas San Pablo, and the\r\n    principal men of the place, there has this day occurred the\r\n    burial of the corpses, victims of the Pulajans, in the cemetery\r\n    of this place, to wit: The officer of volunteers, Rafael Rosales,\r\n    and the following volunteers, viz., Gualberto Gabane, Juan Pacle,\r\n    Dionisio Daisno, Pedro Damtanan, Carmelo Lagbo; also the two women,\r\n    Eustaquia Sapiten and Apolinaria N., also one unknown Pulajan. This\r\n    in fulfilment of the official letter of instructions No. 136,\r\n    from the office of the presidente of the town of Wright dated\r\n    to-day. Said burial ceremonies were conducted by the Reverend\r\n    Father Marcos Gomez, and were attended by the whole volunteer\r\n    force of this place because of the death of their officer Rosales.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Tomas San Pablo,\r\n    President of the Board of Health.\r\n\r\n    Peregrin Albano,\r\n    Councillor.\r\n\r\n    (Illegible)----Moro, Captain of Volunteers. [436]\r\n\r\n\r\nFancy having documents like the foregoing handed you with\r\never-increasing regularity as you sauntered, morning after morning,\r\nfrom your bath to your coffee and rolls, preparatory to the daily\r\nsifting of incidents such as that which included the burning of\r\nthe American flag on the head of the municipal representative of\r\nAmerican authority already mentioned, and other like acts of poor\r\nmisguided peasants stirred up by trifling scamps representing the\r\ndregs of insurrection. Motiong was not only within seven miles of\r\nthe court-house at Catbalogan, but it was so near to Camp Bumpus,\r\nover in Leyte, where the 18th Infantry lay, that an order to them\r\nto move in the morning would have made life and property in all that\r\nbrigand-harried region safe that night and continuously thereafter.\r\n\r\nGeneral Wm. H. Carter, Major-General U. S. A., well known to the\r\nAmerican public as the able officer who, in 1911, commanded the United\r\nStates forces mobilized on the Mexican border during the Mexican\r\nrevolution of that year, that ousted President Diaz and seated\r\nPresident Madero, was in command at the time--the fall of 1904--of\r\nthe military district of the Philippines which included Samar and\r\nLeyte. A word of request to him would have made life definitely safe\r\nin all the coast towns and their vicinity within two or three days\r\nafter receipt of such a request.\r\n\r\nBesides Gandara, Catbalogan, Calbayog, and Wright, Lieutenant\r\nCalderon's list included the trio of ill-fated municipalities set\r\nforth below, concluding with the illustrious name of Taft:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF CATUBIG\r\n\r\n    Poblacion              September  5\r\n    Tagabiran                 August 11\r\n    San Vicente               August --\r\n\r\n\r\nCatubig was toward the north end of Samar. On the day of the burning\r\nand sacking of the poblacion of Catubig, September 5th, which was done\r\nby a force of several hundred Pulajans, the scouts and constabulary,\r\nso it was afterward reported, killed a hundred of the Catubig Pulajans\r\nin an engagement. If this report were correct, as is likely, it was\r\nthe biggest single killing of natives since the early days of the\r\ninsurrection. [437] But it did not in the least check the Pulajan\r\ninsurrection, which simply swerved its fury from the Catubig region\r\ntoward the coast (the Pacific coast), descending upon the towns,\r\nvillages, and hamlets of the townships of Borongan and Taft, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF BORONGAN\r\n\r\n    (Calderon's List of Barrios Burned, continued)\r\n\r\n    Sepa                     Sept. 23\r\n    Lucsohong                Sept. 23\r\n    Maybocog                 Sept. 23\r\n    Maydolong                Sept. 23\r\n    Soribao                  Sept. 23\r\n    Bugas                     Oct. 10\r\n    Punta Maria               Oct. 10\r\n    Canjauay                  Oct. 11\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF TAFT\r\n\r\n    (Calderon's List continued)\r\n\r\n    Del Remedio              Sept. 22\r\n    San Julian               Sept. 22\r\n    Nena                     Sept. 22\r\n    Libas                    Sept. 22\r\n    Pagbabangnan             Sept. 22\r\n    San Vicente              Sept. 21\r\n    Jinolaso                 Oct.   3\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the twenty-five pueblos or townships of Samar, the Calderon\r\nlist only pretended to throw light on events in nine of them,\r\nthose being the only ones from which definite news had then reached\r\nheadquarters. But as a reign of terror prevailed all over Samar at the\r\ntime, the rest may be imagined, though it can never be ascertained. Of\r\nthese nine, the last two were:\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF LLORENTE\r\n\r\n    Pagbabalancayan          Sept. 23\r\n\r\n\r\n    MUNICIPALITY OF ORAS\r\n\r\n    Concepcion               Sept. 23\r\n    Jipapad                     --\r\n\r\n\r\nNow it feels just as uncomfortable to be boloed in Pagbabalancayan\r\nas it would in a place with a more pronounceable name, and the same\r\nis true of the comparatively mellifluous Jipapad. True, some of\r\nthese places were mere hamlets of twenty to forty houses, but you\r\nmay be sure there were five or six people, on an average, to each\r\nhouse. On the other hand, glance back again at the list of towns of\r\nthe township of Taft that were sacked and burned, and consider that\r\nSan Julian was about the size of the provincial capital, Catbalogan,\r\nand that Catbalogan, the town proper, contained a population of\r\nfour thousand, though looked at from the amphitheatre of hills which\r\nsurround it, Catbalogan does not look like such a very large group\r\nof houses. Filipino houses are usually full of people. It is easier\r\nto live that way than to build more houses.\r\n\r\nAfter the Pulajan descent on Llorente, the people of Llorente all went\r\noff to the hills to the Pulajans for safety. They were not allowed\r\nto have firearms. This was forbidden by law, except on condition of\r\nmaking formal application for permission, getting it finally approved,\r\nand giving a bond, conditions which, in practical operation, made\r\nthe prohibition all but absolute. The law was general for the whole\r\narchipelago. The theory of the law was that the inhabitants were under\r\n\"the peace and protection of a benign civil government.\" The real\r\nreason of the law was that if the people were allowed to bear arms it\r\nwas very uncertain which side they would use them on, our side or the\r\nother. But, by 1904, the lowland and coast people of Samar would have\r\nbeen glad enough to have stuck to us and gone out after the mountain\r\nrobber bands had we armed them. Left unprotected, a feeling seemed\r\nto spread in many places that about the only thing to do to be safe\r\nwas to depart from under the \"protection\" of the American flag and\r\ntake to the hills and join, or seem to join, the uprising.\r\n\r\nToward the last of September, the provincial treasurer of Samar, an\r\nAmerican, a Mr. Whittier, visited the east coast of Samar, including\r\nTaft. On October 5th, he stated before me as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All the presidentes that I have talked with, and this man Hill,\r\n    [438] said that they wanted some protection for their towns. Except\r\n    at Borongan there are no guns in the hands of the municipal\r\n    police. [439] This band near Taft was said to have nineteen\r\n    guns, and they felt they could not defend their towns with spears\r\n    against these guns. There were reported to be between 200 and 600\r\n    in operation on the coast at that time, and they felt that they\r\n    could not defend their towns with the means at hand. I found at\r\n    Taft that they had taken all the records of the municipality,\r\n    and the money, and taken it over to an island away from the\r\n    main coast, in order to protect their money and their records,\r\n    and I understand the same thing was done at Llorente. At Oras\r\n    they had practically decided to take the same step if it became\r\n    necessary. All of the commercial houses on the east coast and\r\n    a large number of people congregated at Borongan, which was\r\n    safe on account of the protection of the constabulary; and the\r\n    constabulary there were doing very good work, doing everything\r\n    they could with their small force, and they (the presidentes)\r\n    felt that if they had guns in the hands of the municipal police\r\n    or if they had the constabulary to guard their towns, they could\r\n    go out after these people themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe importance of all this testimony, relatively to its forever\r\nsickening any one acquainted with it with colonization by a republic,\r\nis that a transcript of Mr. Whittier's statement of October 5th\r\nwas placed in the hands of the Governor-General a few days later by\r\nMr. Harvey, the Assistant Attorney-General, and yet this situation\r\ncontinued until shortly after the presidential election. Several\r\nyears afterwards, in the North American Review, Judge Ide, who\r\nwas Vice-Governor in 1904, after admitting that he was in constant\r\nconsultation with the Governor-General all through that period (by\r\nway of showing his opportunities for knowing whereof he spoke),\r\ndenied that the failure to order out the military to protect the\r\npeople from massacre had any relation whatever to the presidential\r\nelection then going on in the United States.\r\n\r\nMr. Whittier also stated before me that the total population of the\r\nmunicipality of Taft was 18,000, and that twenty-five men armed with\r\nguns in each of the four principal villages thereof that were burned\r\nwould have prevented the destruction of those villages. So we did not\r\nprotect the people, and we would not let them protect themselves. I\r\ndo not select the pueblo of Taft on account of its distinguished\r\nname. \"What's in a name?\" The fate of Taft and its inhabitants was\r\nsimply typical of the fate which descended upon scores of other places\r\nin \"dark and bloody\" Samar between the outbreak of July 10, 1904, and\r\nthe presidential election of November 8th, of that year, and between\r\nthose two dates the shadow of such a fate was over all the towns of\r\nthe island on which it did not in fact descend. Mr. Whittier stated to\r\nme informally that at the time he was speaking of in the above formal\r\nstatement, there were pending and had been pending for a long time\r\n(he seemed to think they must have been pigeon-holed) applications\r\nfor permission to bear arms from fifteen different pueblos. After\r\nMr. Whittier had finished his statement the Presidente of Taft made\r\na like statement on the same day, October 5th. My retained copy\r\nshows that this official bore the ponderous name of Angel Custodio\r\nCrisologo. He declared a willingness to lead his people against\r\nthe Pulajans if given guns, though the fervent soul did qualify\r\nthis martial remark by adding, \"If I am well enough,\" explaining\r\nthat the presidential body was subject to rheumatism. Mr. Crisologo\r\nstated among other things that there had been eight hundred houses\r\nburned in the jurisdiction of Taft before he left the east coast\r\nfor Catbalogan--about a week before. Like Mr. Whittier's, a copy\r\nof Mr. Crisologo's statement was delivered a few days later to\r\nthe Governor-General in person by the Assistant Attorney-General,\r\nMr. Harvey, who had been present when it was made and taken down.\r\n\r\nThis Mr. Harvey need not be, to the western hemisphere reader, a\r\nmere nebulous antipodal entity, as the Hon. Angel Custodio Crisologo\r\nmight. He is a very live American, a very high-toned gentleman, and\r\nan excellent lawyer, and was at last accounts still with the insular\r\ngovernment of the Philippine Islands, though in a higher capacity\r\n(Solicitor General) than he was at the date of the events herein\r\nnarrated. There was very little congenial society in Catbalogan when\r\nMr. Harvey came there to help dispose of the criminal docket, and his\r\nadvent was to me a very welcome oasis in a desert of \"the solitude\r\nof my own originality\"--or lack of originality. On September 19th I\r\nhad wired Vice-Governor Ide that there were 172 prisoners in the jail\r\nawaiting trial and \"many more coming.\" Of course no justice of the\r\npeace would be trusted to pass on whether an alleged outlaw should\r\nor should not be held for trial. If he were secretly in sympathy\r\nwith the discomfiture American authority in Samar was having, he\r\nmight let the man go, no matter what the proof. Also he might seek to\r\nclear himself of all suspicion in each case by committing men against\r\nwhom there was no proof, thus unnecessarily crowding an already fast\r\nfilling provincial jail of limited dimensions, wherein beriberi [440]\r\nwas already making its dread appearance.\r\n\r\nSo the writ of habeas corpus remained unsuspended, thus making it\r\npossible to so state in later official certificates covering that\r\nperiod. But habeas corpus cut no more figure in the situation than\r\nit did at the battle of Gettysburg, or at the crossing of the Red\r\nSea by the chosen people, or at the sinking of the Titanic. The\r\nconstabulary would worry along with such force as they had in the\r\nisland of Samar, only a few hundred, certainly nearer five hundred\r\nthan one thousand. And, whenever they had a battle with the outlaws,\r\nif they themselves were not annihilated, which happened more than\r\nonce, they would bring back prisoners in droves and put them in\r\nthe jail, and I was expected to sift out how much proof they had,\r\nor claimed to have, of overt acts by persons not actually captured\r\nin action. Of course a race then began, a race against death, to see\r\nwhether death or I would get to John Doe or Richard Roe first. And\r\nthough I held court every day except Sunday from August to November\r\n8th, sometimes getting in sixteen hours per day by supplementing a\r\nday's work with a night session, death would often beat me to some\r\none man on the jail list whom I happened to have picked out to get to\r\nthe next day. Men so picked out were men as to whom something I might\r\nhave heard held out the hope of being able to dispose of their cases\r\nquickly by letting them loose, [441] thus getting that much farther\r\nfrom the danger limit of crowding in the jail. Some of these would be\r\nspecially picked out because reported sick. I kept track of the sick\r\nby visiting them myself when practicable, and talking to them. Of\r\ncourse many of them were brigands---Pulajans--but some of them were\r\nthe saddest looking, most abject little brigands that anybody ever\r\nsaw. Of course you might catch some nasty disease from them, but\r\nnobody, somehow, ever seemed to have any apprehension on that score\r\nin the Philippines. This does not argue bravery at all. It is merely\r\nthe listless stoicism that lurks in the climate. I recollect going\r\nto walk one afternoon, after adjourning court at 5 o'clock, saying to\r\nthe prosecuting attorney before adjourning, \"We will take up the case\r\nof Capence Coral in the morning; there does not seem, from what I can\r\nunderstand, to be enough proof to convict him of anything.\" Of course\r\nwhen you were dealing with hundreds of people, you did not have any\r\nnerve-racking hysterics about any one man. Leaving the court-house I\r\npassed by the hospital, where Capence had been transferred, pending\r\nthe arrival of witnesses against him and the rest of the crowd captured\r\nwith him. I asked the hospital steward how Capence was. The answer was\r\nhe had died at 4:45--some twenty minutes before. Death had beat me to\r\nCapence. When I meet Capence he will know I did the best I could. I\r\nwas under a great strain, a sort of writ of habeas corpus incarnate,\r\nthe only thing remotely suggesting relief from unwarranted [442]\r\ndetention on the whole horizon of the situation. I was trying to do\r\nthe best I could by the Constitution, in so far as the spirit of it\r\nhad reached the Philippines. I broke down totally under the strain\r\nabout November 8th, came home in the spring of the following year\r\nand remained an invalid for several years thereafter; and as a noted\r\ncorporation lawyer once said after recovery from a similar illness,\r\n\"I haven't had much constitution since, but have been living mostly\r\nunder the by-laws.\"\r\n\r\nAmerican office-holding in the Philippines is not so popular with\r\nthe Filipinos as to have moved them to any outburst of gratitude in\r\nthe shape of an effort to create a pension system for Americans who\r\nlose their health in the government service out there. When they\r\nleave the Islands they become as one dead so far as the Philippine\r\ninsular government is concerned. And the men whose health is more or\r\nless permanently impaired by disability incurred in line of duty in\r\nthe Philippines are not and will never be numerous or powerful enough\r\nback home to create any sentiment in favor of a pension system for\r\nformer Philippine employees, since the Philippine business is not a\r\nsubject of much popular enthusiasm at best. So if I had not had private\r\nresources, the results of the Samar insurrection of 1904 would have\r\nleft me also in the pitiable plight in which I have beheld so many\r\nof my repatriated former comrades of the Philippine service in the\r\nlast seven years, to whom the heart of the more fortunate ex-Filipino\r\nindeed goes out in sympathy. But to return to the race to beat death\r\nto prisoners in that grim and memorable fall of 1904.\r\n\r\nIn September the crowded condition of the jail had begun to tell on\r\nthe inmates. The constabulary force at Catbalogan was quite inadequate\r\nfor the varied emergencies of the situation, there being, besides\r\nthe town itself to protect, the provincial treasury to guard, the\r\ngovernor's office, the court-house, and the jail. Consequently the jail\r\nguard was too small. The jail buildings were in an enclosure a little\r\nlarger than a baseball diamond, surrounded by high stone walls. But\r\nit was not safe to let the inmates sleep out in the enclosure at\r\nnight. They had to be kept at night in the buildings. Any American\r\nwho has visited the central penitentiary at Manila called Bilibid\r\nhas seen a place almost as clean as a battleship. This is American\r\nwork. But the Filipinos are not trained in sanitary matters, and all\r\nthey know about handling large crowds of prisoners they learned from\r\nthe Spaniards. The Governor was a native half-caste, a very excellent\r\nman, but free from that horror, which I think is an almost universal\r\nAmerican trait, of seeing unnecessary and preventable sacrifice of\r\nhuman life, no matter whose the life. I inspected the jail as often\r\nas was practicable, and managed to keep down the death-rate below\r\nwhat it might have been, the prisoners being allowed to go out in\r\nthe open court during the day. They also had such medical attention\r\nas was available. However, during the last five or six weeks of that\r\nterm of court I would be pretty sure to find on my desk every two or\r\nthree days, on opening court in the morning, a notice like this:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Carcel Provincial de Samar, I. F.\r\n    Oficina del Alcaide\r\n\r\n    Catbalogan, Samar, I. F.,\r\n    22 de Septiembre de 1904.\r\n\r\n    Hon. Sr. Juez de Ia Instancia de esta provincia,\r\n    Catbalogan, Samar, I. F.\r\n\r\n    Senor:\r\n\r\n    Tengo el honor de poner en conocimiento de ese juzgado, que\r\n    anoche entre 12 y 1 de ella, fallecio el procesado, Ramon Boroce,\r\n    a consecuencia de la enfermedad de beriberi, que venia padeciendo.\r\n\r\n    Lo que tengo el honor de communicar a ese Juzgado para su superior\r\n    conocimiento.\r\n\r\n    De U. muy respetuosamente,\r\n    Gonzalo Lucero,\r\n\r\n    Alcaide de la Carcel Provincial.\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich being interpreted means:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Provincial Jail of Samar, P. I.\r\n\r\n    Catbalogan, Samar, P. I.,\r\n    September 22, 1904.\r\n\r\n    His honor, the Judge of First Instance of this province,\r\n    Catbalogan, Samar, P. I.\r\n\r\n    Sir:\r\n\r\n    I have the honor to bring to the knowledge of the court that last\r\n    night between 12 and 1 o'clock, the accused person Ramon Boroce\r\n    died in consequence of the disease of beriberi from which he has\r\n    been suffering; which fact I have the honor to communicate to\r\n    the court for its superior knowledge.\r\n\r\n    Very respectfully,\r\n    Gonzalo Lucero,\r\n\r\n    Warden of the Provincial Jail.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow a jail death-rate of only ten or twelve a month was not at all a\r\nbad record for an insurrection in a Philippine province. It would be\r\nrank demagoguery at this late date to be a party to anybody's getting\r\nexcited about it. I was rather proud of it by comparison with the jail\r\ndeath-rate of the Albay insurrection of the year before, where 120\r\nmen had died in the jail in about six months. But it began to get on\r\none's nerves to have to expect a billet-doux like the above on your\r\ndesk at the opening of court each day, when the accused person had\r\nhad no commitment trial and may have been wholly innocent. It all\r\ncame back to the difference between war and peace, viz., that in war\r\nit is to be expected that many innocent persons will suffer, but that\r\nin peace only the guilty should suffer. Moreover, in war that admits\r\nit is war, your agents, your army, are better able to handle crowds\r\nof prisoners than native police and constabulary, and the percentage\r\nof innocent who suffer with the guilty in such war will be far less;\r\nwhereas the contrary is true of war--waged by constabulary checked\r\nby courts--which pretends that a state of peace exists, i.e., which\r\npretends there is no need for declaring martial law and calling on\r\nyour army.\r\n\r\nIt was this Samar insurrection which convinced me that waging war\r\nwith courts and constabulary in lieu of the recognized method was,\r\nin its net results, the cruelest kind of war, and that the civil\r\ngovernment of the Philippines was a failure, in so far as regarded\r\nMr. McKinley's original injunction to the Taft Commission; where,\r\nafter alluding to the articles of capitulation of the city of Manila\r\nto our forces, which concluded with the words:\r\n\r\n\r\n    This city, its inhabitants * * * and its private property of all\r\n    descriptions * * * are placed under the special safeguard of the\r\n    faith and honor of the American Army,\r\n\r\n\r\nhe added:\r\n\r\n\r\n    As high and sacred an obligation rests upon the Government of\r\n    the United States to give protection for property and life * * *\r\n    to all the people of the Philippine Islands. I charge this\r\n    commission to labor for the full performance of this obligation,\r\n    which concerns the honor and conscience of their country.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommenting on this in his inaugural address as Governor of the\r\nPhilippines, Governor Taft had said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    May we not be recreant to the charge, which he truly says,\r\n    concerns the honor and conscience of our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo matter who was to blame, here we were in Samar, with the\r\n14th Infantry three hours away in one direction at Calbayog,\r\ndoing nothing, and the 18th Infantry five hours away in another\r\ndirection, at Tacloban, doing nothing, and a reign of terror going\r\non in Samar, with the peaceably inclined people of the lowlands\r\nand coast towns appealing to us for protection and not getting it,\r\nsometimes crouching in abject terror without knowing which way to fly,\r\nsometimes taking to the hills and joining the outlaws as a measure\r\nof self-preservation. 'Twas pitiful, wondrous pitiful! I then and\r\nthere decided that we ought to get out of the Philippines as soon\r\nas any decent sort of a native government could be set up, and that\r\nour republic was not adapted to colonization. In his North American\r\nReview article above cited, in denying that the unwillingness of\r\nthe Manila government to order out the army in Samar in the fall\r\nof 1904 had anything to do with the possible effect so doing might\r\nhave had on the presidential election, then in progress in the United\r\nStates, Governor Ide rebuked me with patronizing self-righteousness\r\nthus: \"Was Judge Blount opposed to kindness?\" He means in giving\r\nthe Filipinos, under such circumstances, the \"protection of civil\r\ngovernment,\" instead of ordering out the army. No, but I was opposed\r\nto using a saw, in lieu of a lancet, in excising the ulcers of that\r\nbody politic at that time. In protesting that there was \"nothing\r\nsinister\" about the failure to use the troops, Judge Ide cunningly\r\nwonders whether my attitude was subsequently assumed after I left\r\nthe Islands because of \"proclivities as a Democrat,\" or whether it\r\nwas merely due to \"predilections in favor of military rule.\" Read\r\nMr. McKinley's instructions to the Taft Commission, above quoted,\r\nthat to protect life and property concerned the honor and conscience\r\nof their country, and consider if the Ide suggestion does not seem to\r\nhide its head and slink away in shame before the strong clear light\r\nof what was then a plain duty. As a matter of fact Judge Charles\r\nS. Lobinger, who is still with the Philippine judiciary, visited me\r\nen route to another point, during that Samar term of court, and he\r\nwill recall, should he ever chance upon this book and this chapter,\r\nwith what vehemence I said to him at the time, in effect, \"Judge,\r\nwe belong in the Western Hemisphere. We have no business out here\r\npermanently.\" If proclivities and predilections in favor of affording\r\ndecent protection to the lives and property of defenceless people\r\nby properly garrisoning their towns constitutes lack of kindness,\r\nthen the Ide rebuke was well taken.\r\n\r\nThese details are not related with Pickwickian gravity in order to\r\nacquaint the reader with my utterances as being important per se. But\r\nit is important to make clear to the reader, and he is entitled,\r\nin all frankness, to have it made clear by one who has now so long\r\ndetained his attention on this great subject, to know just when \"the\r\nlight from heaven on the road to Damascus\" broke upon this witness,\r\nand how and why he came to be in favor of Philippine independence,\r\nbecause the reasons which convinced him may seem good in the sight\r\nof the reader also. If the man who reads this book shall see that\r\nthe man who wrote it was, in Samar in 1904, neither a Republican nor\r\na Democrat, but simply an American in a far distant land, jealous\r\nof the honor of his country's flag in its capacity as a symbol of\r\nprotection to those over whom it floated, then the work will not have\r\nbeen written in vain.\r\n\r\nThe presidentes or mayors of the various pueblos were in session\r\nat Catbalogan in semi-annual convention during the first few days\r\nof October, 1904, when the Assistant Attorney-General, Mr. Harvey,\r\nvisited Catbalogan. Mr. Harvey and the writer had taken a number of\r\nlong walks together in the suburbs of Catbalogan, though Major Dade,\r\ncommanding the Samar constabulary, an officer of the regular army,\r\nhad warned us it was not safe outside of town. We had talked over\r\nthe situation fully. Besides all its other aspects, there were a\r\nnumber of American women in Catbalogan, an American lawyer's wife,\r\nthe wife of the superintendent of schools, her sister, and others. It\r\nwas not at all likely that the Pulajans would enter Catbalogan, but\r\nthere was always the possibility, not to be wholly ignored, that some\r\nsuch episode as that of March 23d, of the preceding year, at Surigao,\r\nalready described, might be repeated. As hereinbefore noted, on August\r\n9th, the Pulajans had done some killing and burning at Silanga, less\r\nthan ten miles north of Catbalogan and likewise at Motiong, less than\r\nten miles south of Catbalogan, on September 1st, and on the evening\r\nof September 2d, about 7:30, there had been a false alarm caused\r\nby some native of Catbalogan running down the main street yelling,\r\n\"Pulajans! Pulajans!\" All of which did not tend to make you feel\r\nthat your American women were quite as entirely safe from harm as\r\nthey ought to be.\r\n\r\nIn the course of one of our walks Mr. Harvey and I had stopped on the\r\nmountain side overlooking Catbalogan, to catch our breath and take in\r\nthe view of the town below and the sea beyond. I said to him, because\r\nI knew his mind also was on the one great need of the hour: \"Yes sir,\r\nif President Roosevelt were here, and could see this situation as we\r\ndo, he would order out the army and protect these defenceless people,\r\nno matter which way the chips might fly.\" Mr. Harvey agreed with\r\nme. He promised to go back to Manila and tell the authorities there\r\nso. After we came back to town, we were advised that the convention of\r\npresidentes desired to have Mr. Harvey favor them with an address. He\r\nsaid, \"What shall I tell them?\" I said, \"Tell them that if they will\r\ndo their duty by the American Government, the American Government will\r\ndo its duty by them.\" He spoke Spanish fluently, made a good speech,\r\nand told them in effect just that thing. Then he went back to Manila,\r\nand shortly afterward wrote me the two letters which follow:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Department of Justice, Philippine Islands,\r\n    Office of the Assistant Attorney-General\r\n    for the Constabulary,\r\n\r\n                                        Manila, P. I., October 15, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Judge: We arrived in Manila on Tuesday morning,\r\n    the 11th instant, and I prepared my report and submitted it\r\n    to the attorney-general on the 12th, in the meantime making a\r\n    transcript of your summary and delivering a copy of same with other\r\n    information to the attorney-general along with my report. After\r\n    dictating the report and before delivering it I had a conversation\r\n    with General Allen on the situation in Samar and told him what\r\n    my recommendations would be. He agreed that rewards should be\r\n    offered for the capture of Pablo Bulan, Antonio Anogar, and Pedro\r\n    de la Cruz, but took issue on the other recommendations, and to my\r\n    mind he takes a very extreme view; but I thought at the time and\r\n    still think that he wanted to tone me down in my feelings in the\r\n    matter. I think the real cause for his opposition is the effect\r\n    that he fears an aggressive attitude might have on the presidential\r\n    election. In other words, whatever they do aggressively might be\r\n    misconstrued and made use of as political capital.\r\n\r\n    At Governor Wright's request I got the report from the\r\n    attorney-general before it was sent up and went over to the\r\n    Malacanan, and the governor read the report and read most of the\r\n    data that I submitted with the report, including your summary, and\r\n    while he did not say much what he did say convinced me that there\r\n    would be something doing if it were not on the eve of election,\r\n    and in my opinion there will be things doing in Samar within\r\n    thirty days.\r\n\r\n    I inclose herewith a copy of your summary, and also a copy of my\r\n    report to the attorney-general. On the 18th instant I received\r\n    your telegram to hold the completion of your summary until receipt\r\n    of a letter mailed by you that day. I telegraphed you in reply\r\n    that my report and your summary were placed in the hands of the\r\n    attorney-general on the 12th instant. If there is any additional\r\n    data in your letter mailed on the 13th I will submit it to the\r\n    proper authorities.\r\n\r\n    For the lack of time, I will close, and write more next time.\r\n\r\n\r\n        Very truly yours,\r\n        (Signed) Geo. R. Harvey,\r\n        Assistant Attorney-General.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Department of Justice, Philippine Islands,\r\n    Office of the Assistant Attorney-General,\r\n    for the Constabulary,\r\n\r\n                                        Manila, P. I., October 19, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n    My dear Judge Blount: Since mailing my letter to you of last\r\n    Saturday I have found the copies of your summary on the situation\r\n    in Samar and inclose two herewith, in accordance with my promise.\r\n\r\n    This week we have received some good news from Samar with\r\n    reference to important captures and killings of Pulajans. I\r\n    am not in touch with what is going on with reference to Samar,\r\n    and can give you no information along that line. As I remember,\r\n    the governor told me the other day when I was talking with him\r\n    that one more company of scouts will be sent down right away.\r\n\r\n    I sincerely hope the situation is improving, and that you are\r\n    getting along rapidly in disposing of the large docket before\r\n    you. If there is not a very great improvement in the situation\r\n    by the 9th of November, I think there will be a considerable\r\n    movement of troops in Samar within thirty days. For the good of the\r\n    government, I hope the situation will improve materially before\r\n    that time. I would like to see them put the troops there right\r\n    now. I am of the opinion that it would not affect the election a\r\n    half-dozen votes, and it might save two or three or a half-dozen\r\n    massacres and the destruction of much property.\r\n\r\n    With best wishes for your success in your work, and with regards\r\n    to Mr. Block, I am,\r\n\r\n\r\n        Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n        Geo. R. Harvey,\r\n\r\n        Assistant Attorney-General, Philippines Constabulary.\r\n        To Hon. James H. Blount,\r\n        Judge of First Instance, Catbalogan, Samar, P. I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese two letters may be found at p. 2532, Congressional Record,\r\nFebruary 25, 1908, where they were the subject of remark in the House\r\nof Representatives by Hon. Thomas W. Hardwick of Georgia, apropos of\r\nGovernor Ide's North American Review article of December, 1907.\r\n\r\nA few weeks after the presidential election I saw Mr. Harvey\r\nin Manila. We naturally talked about Samar and his two letters\r\nto me. The troops had then been ordered out. He referred to his\r\nconference with the Governor-General and stated, \"Yes, he told me\r\nthat was the reason,\" meaning that the reason for not ordering out\r\nthe troops was the one assigned in his (Harvey's) letter to me, viz.,\r\n\"Whatever we do aggressively might be misconstrued and made use of\r\nas political capital.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 18, 1904, there was received at Manila the following\r\ncablegram concerning the presidential campaign in the United States:\r\n\r\n\r\n    New York, 16th. Judge Parker, in addressing campaign clubs at\r\n    Esopus the past week returned to the subject of the Philippines\r\n    in the evident hope of making it a paramount issue of the\r\n    campaign. He repeated his former declaration that the retention\r\n    of the Philippines and the carrying out of the policy of the\r\n    Republican Administration have cost six hundred and fifty millions\r\n    of dollars and two hundred thousand lives. Secretary of War Taft,\r\n    in addressing a mass meeting held in Baltimore, Saturday night,\r\n    ridiculed Judge Parker's statement and characterized his figures\r\n    as alarmist.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course Judge Parker's figures were rather high--of which more\r\nanon. He was not going to miss anything in the way of a chance of\r\n\"getting a rise\" out of the Administration, by understatement. But some\r\nstatement from the Philippines at once became a supremely important\r\ndesideratum, to counterbalance Judge Parker's over-statement, some\r\noptimism to meet the Parker pessimism. Encouraged by the public\r\ninterest aroused by the figures furnished him, and the consequent\r\napparent uneasiness it created in \"the enemy's camp,\" Judge Parker\r\nsoon had the whole Philippine group of islands going to \"the demnition\r\nbow-wows.\" On October 20th, Secretary of War Taft cabled Governor\r\nWright, then Governor-General of the Islands, a long telegram, quoting\r\nJudge Parker as having used, among other language descriptive of the\r\nbeatitudes we had conferred on our little brown brother, the following:\r\n\"The towns in many places in ruins, whole districts in the hands of\r\nladrones.\" [443]\r\n\r\nAt that time the whole archipelago was absolutely quiet for the nonce,\r\nexcept Samar. Samar was the only island where Judge Parker's statement\r\nwas true, and as to Samar, it was absolutely true. On October 23d\r\nGovernor Wright wired Secretary of War Taft as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is nothing warranting the statement that towns are in\r\n    ruins. It is not true that there are whole districts in the hands\r\n    of ladrones. Life and property are as safe here as in the United\r\n    States. [444]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was followed by a perfectly true and correct picture of the\r\npeace and quiet which then prevailed for the time being everywhere\r\nthroughout the archipelago, except in Samar, which dark and bloody\r\nisle was specifically excepted. Then followed a statement as to\r\nSamar, full of allusions as elaborately optimistic as any of the Taft\r\ncablegrams of 1900, to impliedly inconsiderable \"prowling bands\" of\r\noutlaws in Samar. Of course nobody at home knew the answer to this,\r\nso it silenced the Parker batteries, and the Samar massacres proceeded\r\nunchecked. Meanwhile the 14th Infantry at Calbayog, Samar, and the 18th\r\nInfantry, at Tacloban, Leyte, smiled with astute, if contemptuous,\r\ntolerance, at the self-inflicted impotence of a republic trying to\r\nmake conquered subjects behave without colliding too violently with\r\nhome sentiment against having conquered subjects; sang their favorite\r\nbarrack room song,\r\n\r\n\r\n            He may be a brother of Wm. H. Taft,\r\n            But he ain't no friend of mine;\r\n\r\n\r\nand continued to enjoy enforced leisure. They did chafe under the\r\nrestraint, but it at least relieved them from the not altogether\r\ninspiring task of chasing Pulajans through jungles and along the\r\nslippery mire of precipitous mountain trails, and at the same time\r\npermitted the secondest second lieutenant among them to swear fierce\r\nblase oaths, not wholly unjustified, about how much better he could\r\nrun the Islands than they were being run.\r\n\r\nOn October 26th, I wired Governor Wright at Manila as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Since my letter of October 6th, situation appears worse. Additional\r\n    depredations both on east and west coast. Smith-Bell closing\r\n    out. [445] Reliable American residing in Wright says that during\r\n    week ending last Sunday thirteen families living along river\r\n    Nacbac, barrio of Tutubigan, said pueblo, kidnapped by brigands\r\n    and carried off to hills. This means some sixty people having\r\n    farms along river, rice ready to be harvested. Seven of the eleven\r\n    barrios of Wright have been burned.\r\n\r\n            Blount.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I sent that telegram of October 26th, the situation in the pueblo\r\nof Wright was typical of the reign of terror throughout the island.\r\nWright could have been reached by the 18th Infantry (then over at\r\nTacloban, in Leyte), and garrisoned on eight hours' notice. But I had\r\nlittle hope that the telegram would stir the 18th. The best man I had\r\never personally known well in high station was at the head of the\r\ngovernment of the Islands, and as he was my friend, I sat down to\r\nthink the situation out, determined, with the prejudice which is the\r\nprivilege of friendship, to analyze his apparent apathy, and to\r\nconjecture how many times thirteen families \"having farms along river,\r\nrice ready to be harvested\" would have to be carried off to the hills\r\nby the brigands in order to move the 18th Infantry before the\r\npresidential election. Then I wondered just how many seconds it\r\nwould have taken a British governor-general, backed by unanimous\r\nhome sentiment concerning the wisdom of having colonies, to have\r\nacted, had a great British colonial mercantile house like Smith,\r\nBell & Co. appealed to him for protection of its interests. And that\r\nbrought me, there on \"the tie-ribs of earth,\" as Kipling would phrase\r\nit, to the fundamentals of the problem. The British imperial idea of\r\nwhich Kipling is the voice and Benjamin Kidd the accompanist is based,\r\nsuperficially, upon a supposed necessity for the control of the tropics\r\nby non-tropical peoples, though fundamentally, it is an assertion of\r\nthe right of any people to assume control of the land and destinies\r\nof another when they feel sure they can govern that other better than\r\nthat other can govern itself. Is this proposition tenable, and if so,\r\nwithin what limits? Is it tenable to the point of total elimination of\r\nthe people sought to be improved? If not, then how far? How far is\r\nincidental sacrifice of human life negligible in the working out of\r\nthe broader problem of \"the greatest good of the greatest number?\" In\r\nhis article in the North American Review for December, 1907, Governor\r\nIde makes exhaustive answer to \"the doctors who for some months past,\r\nin the columns of the North American Review and elsewhere, have\r\npublished prescriptions for curing the ills of the Filipino people,\"\r\nincluding Senator Francis G. Newlands, Hon. William J. Bryan, and the\r\nwriter. In the course of disposing of the quack last mentioned,\r\nGovernor Ide gets on rather a high horse, asking, with much dignified\r\nindignation, \"How many people in the United States would have known or\r\ncared whether the army was or was not ordered out in Samar in 1904?\"\r\nI concede that the solicitude was a super-solicitude, as do the Harvey\r\nletters, but like them, I must recognize its reality. However, when\r\nGovernor Ide reaches this rhapsody of conscious virtue: \"It is\r\ninconceivable that the Commission could have been animated by the\r\nbase and ignoble partisan prejudices thus charged against them,\"\r\ncapping his climax by triumphantly pointing out that \"Governor-General\r\nWright was a life-long Democrat,\" he doth protest too much. For the\r\nangelic pinions he thus attaches to himself are at once rudely snapped\r\nby the reflection that a very short while after his article came out\r\nin the North American Review Governor Wright became Secretary of War\r\nin President Roosevelt's Cabinet, and a little later took the stump\r\nfor Taft and Sherman, in 1908. Governor Wright did not stoop to deny\r\nor extenuate his share in the matter, and I honor him for it. [446]\r\nBut to stick to your own crowd and then deny afterwards that you did\r\nso--that is another story. However, let us brush aside such petty\r\nattempts to cloud the real issue, which is: How many people would\r\nGovernor Wright and Vice-Governor Ide have permitted to be massacred\r\nby the Pulajans in Samar in 1904 before they would have ordered out\r\nthe military prior to the presidential election? Let us consider the\r\ncase, not with a view of clouding the issue, but of clearing it. The\r\ntruth is, Governor Wright was very gravely concerned about the Samar\r\nsituation from August to November, 1904. Of course it is due to him\r\nto make perfectly clear that he did not realize the gravity of that\r\nsituation as vividly as those of us who were on the ground in Samar,\r\nfour or five hundred miles away. But the information hereinbefore\r\nreviewed, conveyed to him by the Provincial Governor, by Mr. Harvey,\r\nthe Assistant Attorney General sent to Samar for the express purpose\r\nof getting the Manila government in possession of the exact situation,\r\nand by myself, was certainly sufficient to make him \"chargeable with\r\nnotice\" of all that happened thereafter, certainly chargeable with\r\nknowledge of all that had happened theretofore. Of course there\r\nwas General Allen, the commander-in-chief of the constabulary, at\r\nManila, presumably speaking well of his command--the right arm of\r\nthe civil government--presumably giving industrious and tactful aid\r\nand comfort to the idea that the authorities could afford to worry\r\nalong with the constabulary alone until after the presidential\r\nelection. But that could not discount the actual facts reported\r\nfrom the afflicted province by the officials on the ground. General\r\nAllen, it should be noted, remained in Manila all this time. So that\r\nany Otis-like \"situation-well-in-hand\" bouquets he may have thrown\r\nat his subordinates in Samar, and the situation there generally,\r\nwere mere political hothouse products, surer to be recognized as\r\nsuch by the shrewd kindliness of the truly considerable man at the\r\nhead of the government than by most any one else he could hand them\r\nout to. That man knew, to all intents and purposes, in the great and\r\nnoble heart of him, what was really going on in Samar. He knew that\r\nmassacres had been occurring, and that they were likely to keep on\r\noccurring. In other words, he knew that preventable sacrifice of life\r\nof defenceless people was going on, and that he could put a stop to it\r\nany time he saw fit. The question he had to wrestle with was, should he\r\nstop it, knowing the \"Hell fer Sartin\" the Democratic orators in the\r\nUnited States would at once luridly describe as \"broke loose\" in the\r\nPhilippines? I insist that there is no use for any holier-than-thou\r\ngentleman to become suffused with any glow of indignant conscious\r\nrectitude based on the premises we are considering. Better to look\r\na little deeper, on the idea that you are observing your republic in\r\nflagrante colonizatione, with as good a man as you ever have had, or\r\never will have, among you, as the principal actor. Governor Wright's\r\ncourse was entirely right, if the Philippine policy was right. If his\r\ncourse was not right, it was not right because the Philippine policy\r\nis fundamentally wrong. Governor Wright of course believed that the\r\nPhilippine policy was right. I myself did not come finally to believe\r\nit was wrong until it was revealed in all its rawness by the period now\r\nunder discussion. Of course the Governor did not vividly realize that\r\nthe American women in Catbalogan were not entirely safe. If he had,\r\nhe would have rushed the troops there, politics or no politics. But\r\nnative life was politically negligible. What difference would a few\r\nscore, or even a few hundred, natives of Samar make, compared with\r\nthat pandemonium of anarchy and bloodshed all over the archipelago\r\nwhich Messrs. Taft, Wright, and Ide had long been insisting would\r\nfollow Philippine independence? Was the whole future of 8,000,000 of\r\npeople to be jeopardized to save a few people in Samar? That was the\r\nmoral question before the insular government, in its last analysis. And\r\nthe government faced the proposition squarely, and answered it \"No.\"\r\n\r\nI will go farther than this. If I had believed, with Messrs. Taft,\r\nWright, and Ide, that Philippine independence meant anarchy in the\r\nIslands, and the orthodox \"bloody welter of chaos,\" I too might have\r\nhesitated to order out the troops on the eve of the election, and\r\nmy hesitation, like theirs, might have continued until the election\r\nwas safely over. So might yours, reader. Don't be so certain you\r\nwould not. Practically absolute power, sure of its own benevolence,\r\nhas temptations to withhold its confidence from the people that you\r\nwot not of. Don't condemn Governor Wright. Condemn the policy, and\r\nchange your republic back to the course set by its founders. Give\r\nthe Philippine people the independence they of right ought to have,\r\ninstead of secretly hoping to unload them on somebody else, through\r\nthe medium of your next great war.\r\n\r\nThe question of whether the troops should have been ordered out\r\nor not at the time above dealt with is by no means without two\r\nsides. On the \"bloody welter\" side, you have the well-known opinions\r\nof Messrs. Taft, Wright, and Ide. On the other side you have before\r\nyou--for the moment--only my little opinion. So instead of having in\r\nGovernor Wright a Bluebeard, you simply have a man of great personal\r\nprobity and unflinching moral courage, following his convictions to\r\ntheir ultimate logical conclusion without shadow of turning, in the\r\nact of colonization. In other words, Mr. American, you see yourself,\r\nas others see you. So face the music and look at yourself. In your\r\ncolony business, you are a house divided against itself, which\r\ncannot stand. On the other hand, I knew the Filipino people far more\r\nintimately than either Mr. Taft, Governor Wright, or Judge Ide. I spoke\r\ntheir language--which they did not. I had met them both in peace and\r\nin war--which they had not. I had held court for months at a time in\r\nvarious provinces of the archipelago from extreme northern Luzon to\r\nMindanao--which they had not. I had met the Filipinos in their homes\r\nfor years on terms of free and informal intercourse impracticable\r\nfor any governor-general. It was therefore perfectly natural that I\r\nshould know them better than any of these eminent gentlemen. I was\r\nnot prepared to be in a hurry about recommending myself out of office\r\nby assenting that our guardianship over the Filipinos should at once\r\nbe terminated, but I knew there was nothing to the \"bloody welter\"\r\nproposition. The home life of the Filipino is too altogether a model\r\nof freedom from discord, pervaded as it is by parental, filial, and\r\nfraternal love, and their patriotism is too universal and genuine,\r\nto give the \"bloody welter\" bugaboo any standing in court.\r\n\r\nBut whosoever questions for one moment Governor Wright's high personal\r\ncharacter, simply does not know the man. To do so, moreover, would\r\nfatally cloud the issue I have sought to make clear between his\r\nview of the duty of our government and my own. In his moods that\r\nreminded one of Lincoln, Governor Wright used to say: \"Don't shoot\r\nthe organist, he's doing the best he can.\" It is true that his\r\nanswer to Judge Parker was not a full and frank statement of the\r\ncase. But did it lie in American human nature, when your antagonist\r\nwas recklessly over-stating the case in the heat of debate on the\r\neve of a presidential election, to take him into your confidence\r\nand tell him all you knew, in simple trusting faith that he would\r\nthereafter quit exaggerating? To permit the dispute to boil down to\r\nthe real issue, viz., how many lives it was permissible to abandon on\r\nthe \"greatest good to the greatest number\" theory, would obviously\r\njeopardize the existence of a government which the Governor of the\r\nPhilippines naturally believed to be better for all concerned than\r\nany other. And there is your cul-de-sac. Hinc illae lachrymae.\r\n\r\nWe can point with pride to many things we have done in the\r\nPhilippines, the public improvements, [447] the school system, the\r\nbetter sanitation, and a long list of other benefits conferred. But in\r\nthe greatest thing we have done for them, we have builded wiser than\r\nwe knew. \"God moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform.\" In\r\nfourteen years we have welded the Filipinos into one homogeneous\r\npolitical unit. In a most charming book, entitled An Englishwoman in\r\nthe Philippines, [448] we can see our attempts to fit government by\r\ntwo political parties into over-seas colonization caricatured without\r\nsting until we really remind ourselves of a hippopotamus caressing a\r\nsquirrel. In one passage the British sister describes our programme\r\nas one \"to educate the Filipino for all he is worth, so that he may,\r\nin the course of time, be fit to govern himself according to American\r\nmethods; but at the same time they have plenty of soldiers to knock\r\nhim on the head if he shows signs of wanting his liberty before the\r\nAmericans think he is fit for it\"--\"A quaint scheme,\" she naively adds,\r\n\"and one full of the go-ahead originality of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe more we teach the Filipinos, the more intimately they will become\r\nacquainted, in their own way, with the history of the relations\r\nbetween our country and theirs from the beginning, including the\r\ntaxation without representation, through Congressional legislation\r\n(hereinafter noticed) placed or kept on our statute-books by the hemp\r\ntrust and other special interests in the United States. And they will\r\nlearn all these things in the midst of a \"growing gulf between the\r\ntwo peoples.\" [449]\r\n\r\nIn fourteen years we have made these unwilling subjects, whom we\r\nneither want nor need any more than they want or need us, a unit; a\r\nunit for Home Rule in preference to alien domination, it is true; but,\r\nnevertheless, a patriotic unit--one people--a potential body politic\r\nwhich can take a modest, but self-respecting place in the concert of\r\nfree nations, with only a little more additional help from us.\r\n\r\nIn the handling of an insurrection in any given province with\r\ncourts and constabulary during the first four or five years after\r\nthe Taft government of the Philippines was founded, the function of\r\na representative of the office of the Attorney-General, coming from\r\nManila to help the local prosecuting attorney handle a large docket\r\nand a crowded jail, was by no means remotely analogous to that of a\r\ngrand jury. He originated prosecutions, found \"No Bill,\" etc. When\r\nMr. Harvey came to Samar, he came direct to the court room, and I\r\nsuspended the trial of the pending case, and, after greeting him,\r\nbegan an informal talk which was akin to the nature of a charge to\r\na grand jury, putting him in possession of the general aspects of\r\nthe uprising. He was a very just and kindly man, and entered into\r\nthe spirit of the task. I elaborated on the class of cases where\r\nthe defendant claimed, as most of them did, \"Yes, I joined the band\r\nof brigands, but I was made to do so.\" It was also indictable to\r\nfurnish supplies to the public enemy. This presented the class of\r\ncases where the brigands would swoop down on a town and demand rice,\r\nand not getting it, would sometimes kill the persons refusing it,\r\nand so intimidate the rest into finding rice for them. Also there was\r\nthe class of cases where a man would claim to have been one of the\r\ninhabitants of an unprotected town who had gone off to the hills in a\r\nbody, for safety, to propitiate the mountain people by becoming part of\r\nthem. This sort of thing at one time threatened to become epidemic with\r\nall the coast towns. It did not, however. A modus vivendi of some sort,\r\nsometimes express, sometimes merely tacit, would be arranged between\r\nthe coast people and the hill people. These modus vivendi arrangements\r\nenabled the coast people to obtain a certain degree of safety, in\r\nlieu of that we should have secured them but did not, by making the\r\nhill folk believe that the coast men were against us and for them. At\r\none time the prosecuting attorney got hold of evidence sufficient to\r\nauthorize the issuance of a warrant for the Presidente of Balangiga,\r\nthe man supposed to have engineered the massacre of the 9th Infantry\r\nin September 1901. I authorized the issuance of the warrant for his\r\narrest. But the native governor of the province, and also Major Dade,\r\nthe American regular officer commanding the constabulary, satisfied me\r\nthat we did not have force sufficient to protect Balangiga from the\r\nPulajans, if we arrested the presidente, who, being persona grata to\r\nthe Pulajans, was able to keep them from descending on his town. To\r\narrest him would therefore mean, in their opinion, that the people\r\nof Balangiga would take to the hills for protection, and join the\r\nhill folk, or Pulajans, and if a town as large as Balangiga set any\r\nsuch example all the coast towns might follow it. So the supposed\r\nperpetrator of the 9th Infantry massacre was allowed to remain\r\nunmolested. The American court was impotent to enforce its processes.\r\n\r\nIn my mass of Philippine papers there is one containing a copy of my\r\nremarks to the Assistant Attorney-General on his arrival at Catbalogan,\r\nabove referred to as analogous to a charge to a grand jury at home. It\r\nis dated Catbalogan, Samar, September 28, 1904, and is headed:\r\n\"Remarks by the court upon the occasion of the arrival of Assistant\r\nAttorney-General Harvey, with regard to the recent disturbances in\r\nSamar, and the cases for brigandage and sedition growing out of the\r\nsame.\" Certain parts of this contemporary document will doubtless\r\ngive the reader a more vivid apprehension of the then situation than\r\nhe can get from mere subsequent description. Of course the visiting\r\nrepresentative of the Attorney-General's office was familiar in a\r\ngeneral way with the manner of the handling of the Albay insurrection\r\nin the previous year, described in the chapter preceding this. In\r\ndiscussing the Samar situation the \"remarks\" of the court contain,\r\namong other things, this passage:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the cases growing out of the Albay disturbances there were\r\n    a great many people who strayed out to the mountains just like\r\n    cattle. They did not know why or whither they went. As to those\r\n    persons, Judge Carson, Mr. Ross, and myself were unanimous in the\r\n    opinion that some of them could be indicted under the vagrancy\r\n    law. There were others of a greater degree of guilt, but who did\r\n    not appear to have been what you might call ordinary thieves,\r\n    and we were all agreed to indict those under the sedition law,\r\n    the limit of which is ten years and ten thousand dollars. Thus you\r\n    do not force upon a Judge of First Instance the responsibility of\r\n    sentencing a man to twenty years of his life for a connection with\r\n    bandits which may be but little more than technical. Besides those\r\n    two classes, there were in Albay of course the bandits proper,\r\n    to whom the bandolerismo [brigandage] law was specially intended\r\n    to apply. There cannot be any doubt about the fact that this\r\n    bandolerismo law is one of the most stringent statutes that ever\r\n    was on the statute-books of any country. It is very far from the\r\n    purpose of this court to attempt to say what would be the wisest\r\n    legislation, or to say that this is not the very best legislation,\r\n    under the circumstances. How we administer the several laws\r\n    alluded to governing public order, will settle whether or not\r\n    substantial justice is done.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men in the United States who in those days were slinging mud at\r\nthe Philippine trial judges as being \"subservient,\" wholly missed\r\nthe core of the whole matter. In the provinces where so many heavy\r\nsentences were imposed, the real situation was that a state of war\r\nexisted, and the judges believed, and I think correctly, that they were\r\npractically a military commission of one, and much more able to give\r\na prisoner a square deal, tempering justice with mercy, than officers\r\nbriefly gathered from the scenes of the fighting to act as a military\r\ncommission. We tried those men with as little prejudice as if they had\r\njust come from the moon. Moreover, from the italicized concluding words\r\nof the above excerpt from my talk to the Assistant Attorney-General,\r\nit will be seen that the court had practically unlimited discretion\r\nin the matter of punishment, and was, in fact, about the only court\r\nof criminal equity in the annals of Anglo-Saxon jurisprudence.\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis, the righteousness or unrighteousness of a civil\r\ngovernment in a country not yet entirely subjugated, depends on whether\r\nmore innocent people suffer through completing the work of subjugation\r\nwith constabulary whose \"prisoners of war\" are tried, to see what\r\nthey may have done, if anything, by one-man courts, or whether more\r\ninnocent people suffer through completing the work of subjugation as\r\nany other great power on earth but ourselves would have completed it,\r\nwith an army, trying the prisoners by military commission. Unless you\r\nyourself were a traitor to your country, you considered as criminal\r\nattempts to subvert your government by cut-throats that no one of\r\nthe respectable Filipinos, from Aguinaldo and Juan Cailles down,\r\nwould have hesitated to have shot summarily. But you sought to\r\nmake the punishment in each case fit the crime, by ascertaining\r\nas dispassionately as if the defendant were fresh from the moon,\r\njust what each accused man had himself done. Either Aguinaldo, or\r\nan American military commission would have had such people shot in\r\nbunches, as not entitled to be treated as prisoners of war. The trouble\r\nwith the civil government did not lie in its judiciary, but in its\r\nconstabulary. It was the physical handling of the crowds of prisoners\r\nby the constabulary, and their failure, because not numerous enough,\r\nto protect peaceably inclined people, which made it a fact that turning\r\nthe situation over to the military would have meant less sacrifice of\r\nthe innocent along with the guilty. It is much more merciful to kill\r\na few hundred people, as a lesson to the rest, and let the rest go,\r\nwith the clear understanding that if they insurrect again you will\r\npromptly kill a few hundred more, than to permit a reign of terror\r\nfrom one month to another and from one year to another, with all the\r\nuntilled fields, famine, pestilence, and other disease this involves,\r\nmerely in order to be able to invoke the blessing of the Doctor Lyman\r\nAbbots of the world on a supposedly benign \"civil\" government.\r\n\r\nIn all my sentences, and in all his indictments, Mr. Harvey and the\r\nwriter sailed close to the wind, by holding only those responsible\r\nwho had taken active parts in the sacking and burning of villages and\r\nthe massacre of their inhabitants. I knew that sooner or later some\r\nofficious prosecuting attorney of less noble mould than Harvey would\r\nask me to convict some poor creature of brigandage for giving a little\r\nrice to the brigands, and my mind was made up to refuse to do so,\r\nand in so refusing to commit heresy once and for all by expressing my\r\nsentiments, in the decision, concerning the failure to give adequate\r\nprotection to defenceless people, along the lines indicated in this\r\nchapter. No such case was in fact presented. I broke down under the\r\nstrain of graver cases early in November and left Samar forever,\r\nbound for Manila.\r\n\r\nBefore I left, the whole island was seething with sedition. I was\r\ntold by a credible American that the chief deputy sheriff of the\r\ncourt, an ex-insurgent officer, one of the \"peace-at-any-price\"\r\npolicy appointees, had remarked among some of his own people where he\r\ndid not expect the remark to be repeated: \"I see no use persecuting\r\nour brethren in the hills.\" The municipal officials of the provincial\r\ncapital, Catbalogan, were suspected by the native provincial governor,\r\nand the latter in turn was suspected by the Manila government. In\r\nfact the whole political atmosphere of the island had become full of\r\nrumor and suspicion as to who was for the government, and who was\r\nagainst the government. I left Samar, November 8th, which was the\r\nday of the presidential election of 1904, determined to try no more\r\ninsurrections. By that time nearly everybody in the island was more\r\nor less guilty of sedition, and I did not know the method of drawing\r\nan indictment against a whole people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR WRIGHT--1905\r\n\r\n        My heart is heavy with the fate of that unhappy people.\r\n\r\n                       Speech of Hon. A. O. Bacon in U. S. Senate. [450]\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the especially cordial relations which existed to the last\r\nbetween Governor Wright and myself [451] are familiar to a number of\r\nvery dear mutual friends, I deem it due both to them and to myself,\r\nin view of the contents of the preceding chapter, to state that I\r\nsee no reason why, in writing a history of the American Occupation\r\nof the Philippines, I should omit or slur the facts which convinced\r\nme that that occupation ought to terminate as soon as practicable,\r\nand that any decent kind of a government of Filipinos by Filipinos\r\nwould be better for all concerned than the McKinley-Taft programme of\r\nBenevolent Assimilation whereof Governor Wright was the legatee. By the\r\nthousand and one uncandid threads of that programme, slowly woven from\r\n1898 to 1904, as indicated in the first sixteen chapters of this book,\r\nGovernor Wright had found himself as hopelessly bound to concealment\r\nfrom the American people of the real situation in Samar in the fall\r\nof 1904, as a Gulliver in Lilliput.\r\n\r\nWhen I finally left Samar and came to Manila, in November, 1904, I\r\nwas not prepared to figure out how or how soon, the blunder we made\r\nby the purchase of the Philippine archipelago could be corrected. But\r\nmy mental attitude toward the whole Philippine problem had undergone\r\na complete change. In 1901 Governor Wright, then Vice-Governor, had\r\nwritten me: \"You younger men out here, who have cast your fortunes with\r\nthis country, are to be, in all likelihood, in the natural course of\r\nevents, its future rulers.\" Up to 1903 I had clung to that idea with\r\nthe devotion of what was really high and earnest purpose, untroubled\r\nwith misgivings of any kind. In November, 1903, in Albay, Judge Carson\r\nand myself had talked over the long struggle of the civil government\r\nto walk without leaning on the military, and, with the readiness of one\r\nvested with authority to believe such authority wisely vested, and the\r\nreadiness of a civilian lawyer to jealously guard the American home\r\nidea that the military should be subordinate to the civil authority,\r\nI had cordially agreed with a sentiment one day expressed by Judge\r\nCarson concerning Governor Taft about \"the splendid moral fibre of\r\nthe man,\" meaning in keeping the military from prancing out of the\r\ntraces. After Governor Taft left the Islands to be Secretary of War\r\n(December 23, 1903), and while I was still in Albay, I had learned of\r\nthe 120 men who had died in the Albay jail while awaiting trial, and\r\nthereafter something of the magnitude of the Ola insurrection there,\r\nand that had given me pause as to the practical benevolence of the\r\noperation of \"a benign civil government.\" Then the Samar massacres\r\nof 1904, and the gory panorama I had there witnessed, had finally\r\nconvinced me that a republic like ours is wholly unfitted to govern\r\npeople against their consent. But I did not tell anybody in Manila\r\nall these things. I simply pondered them. Grover Cleveland was the\r\nonly man in the world I would have liked to talk to just then freely\r\nand fully. And he was not about. \"My heart was heavy with the fate\r\nof that unhappy people\" as Senator Bacon had said in the Senate in\r\n1902, after visiting the Islands in 1901. I did not condemn Governor\r\nWright. I quite realized that I was \"up against\" about the largest\r\nethical problem of world politics, one on which the nations are much\r\ndivided, and that I was not infallible. I did not say to the Governor:\r\n\"Governor, let's resign and go home and tell our people that this whole\r\nbusiness is a mistake.\" Nor did I ever lose faith in Governor Wright\r\npersonally. If I had, I might just as well have said: \"After this,\r\nthe deluge.\" I would simply have lost faith in human nature. I had not\r\nthen, nor have I since, known a man of higher personal character. I\r\nhad simply lost faith in Benevolent Assimilation, and begun to take\r\nthe Filipino people seriously as a potential nation, probably better\r\nable to handle their own domestic problems than we will ever be able\r\nto handle them for them.\r\n\r\nThe day after I resigned, Mr. Justice Carson, of the Supreme Court,\r\nand Mr. Wilfley, the Attorney-General, came to call on me. My friends\r\nknew I was very much troubled over the Samar business. I was doing\r\nsome grumbling, but without specifying, because to specify would mean\r\nthat we all of us ought to give up the life careers we had planned for\r\nourselves in the Islands. I knew the old familiar answer a grumbler\r\nwas sure to get in the Philippines, viz., \"Old man, you've been out\r\nhere too long. You better go home.\" But I did a little more grumbling\r\nto my friends Judge Carson and Mr. Wilfley, during the course of their\r\nvisit. They could both pretty well guess what was the matter. But Judge\r\nCarson and I had come out in 1899, and had served through the war\r\ntogether. He knew all about the Albay business, and somewhat of the\r\nSamar business. Wilfley had not come out until the civil government\r\nwas founded in 1901. Mr. Wilfley said cheerily: \"Oh, Blount, you are\r\ntoo conscientious.\" I shall never forget what happened then. Judge\r\nCarson said, with a ring of something like anger in his tone: \"No,\r\nWilfley, I'll be d--d if he is.\" Is it any wonder that ever since I\r\nhave worn that man, as Hamlet would say, \"in my heart's core\"? Here was\r\nas brave and true an Irishman as ever gained distinction on battlefield\r\nor bench. And he understood. He did not say--which was the implication\r\nof Wilfley's tone--\"Old man, you've been out here too long, and illness\r\nhas made you peevish.\" He knew what was the matter. He knew that as\r\ntrial judges he and I had not been small editions of Lord Jeffries,\r\nas some of our American critics had implied, BUT HE ALSO KNEW THAT\r\nTHERE WAS NO METHOD OF DRAWING AN INDICTMENT AGAINST A WHOLE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nPossibly the intensity of my feelings on this great subject, then\r\nand ever since, hampers the power of clear expression. Therefore,\r\na word more in attempt at elucidation. In 1898, Judge Carson and I,\r\nwith many thousands of other young Americans, had trooped down to\r\nCuba, in the wake of the impetuous Roosevelt, to free the inhabitants\r\nof that ill-fated island from Spanish rule, drive the Spaniards from\r\nthe Western Hemisphere, and put a stop to Spain's pious efforts \"to\r\nspare the great island from the dangers of premature independence,\"\r\nas she always expressed her attitude toward Cuba. We had many of us\r\nbeen fired by the catchy Roosevelt utterance which did so much to\r\nbring on the Spanish War, viz., \"The steps of the White House are\r\nslippery with the blood of the Cuban reconcentrados.\" Then in 1899,\r\nwe had gone to the Philippines, and had ever since been engaged there\r\nin \"sparing the Islands from the danger of premature independence,\"\r\nand the Samar massacres of 1904 were, to me, the apotheosis of the\r\nwork. So that after November 8, 1904, I felt \"The steps of the White\r\nHouse are slippery with the blood of the people of my district.\" It had\r\nall been done under the pious pretence that the Filipinos welcomed our\r\nrule--a pretence which had taken the form for six years of systematic\r\nasseveration that they did so welcome it. Yet it was not true that\r\nthey, or any appreciable fraction of them, had ever welcomed our\r\nrule. And it never will be true. Surely no man can see in this book\r\nany scolding or unkindness. It is an attempt merely to bring home to\r\nmy countrymen a strategic fact, a fact which it is folly to ignore. But\r\nto return to the thread of our story.\r\n\r\nFour days after the presidential election of 1904, to wit, on November\r\n12th, Governor Wright left Manila and went to Samar, including in\r\nhis itinerary various others of the southern islands. [452] Soon\r\nafter their return, the seven hundred native troops in Samar were\r\nincreased to nearly two thousand, and sixteen companies of regulars\r\n(say one hundred men to a company) were also thrown into Samar. It\r\ntook until the end of 1906 to end the trouble. You cannot find in the\r\nreports of the civil authorities anything explaining their three or\r\nfour weeks' stay in the Visayan Islands in November-December, 1904,\r\nthat is not absolutely in accord with the original Taft obsession of\r\n1900 about the popularity of the proposed alien \"civil\" government with\r\nits subjects. Governor Wright's description of the trip says: \"The\r\nwarm hospitality of the Filipino people made this trip of inspection\r\na most agreeable one.\" As a matter of fact, on such occasions, the\r\nmore disaffected a leader of the people was, the more he would seek,\r\nby \"warm hospitality,\" \"warm\" oratory telling the visiting mighty\r\nwhat the visiting mighty longed to hear, parades, fiestas, etc.,\r\nto divert suspicion of sedition from himself. The poor creatures\r\nhad met General Young's cavalry column in northern Luzon in 1899\r\nwith their town bands, doing the only thing they knew of to do to\r\n\"temper the wind to the shorn lamb\"--i.e., to temper it to their\r\nseveral communities--many of them doubtless expecting to be put\r\nto the sword by General Young's troopers, as the Cossacks did the\r\nPersians during the brief and sensational sojourn of that brilliant\r\nyoung administrator, Hon. W. Morgan Shuster, in Persia in 1911-12. I\r\nhave no doubt that high on the list of those extending some of the\r\n\"warm hospitality\" above mentioned appeared the name of Don Jaime de\r\nVeyra. Yet in the summer of 1904 Don Jaime had gotten out of a sick\r\nbed to attend a convention called to send delegates to the Democratic\r\nNational Convention in the United States that year, [453] and also,\r\nin that same year, had run for Governor of Leyte on a platform\r\nthe principal plank of which was Carthago est delenda--\"Carthago\"\r\nbeing us, the American regime. De Veyra was defeated that time,\r\nbut ran again the next time and was elected. While the writer is not\r\none of those who seek to show their \"breadth of view\" by gossiping\r\nwith outsiders regarding what is peculiarly our own affair, still,\r\nthe British view-point of the situation in the Visayan Islands, as\r\nconveyed by an Englishwoman whose husband was engaged in mercantile\r\nbusiness there in 1904-5, and who therefore was certainly in a position\r\nto know the opinion of the little circle of British people at Cebu and\r\nIloilo, may not be superfluous here. This lady, living then at Iloilo,\r\nwrote a series of letters to friends back home in England which she\r\nafterwards published in book form. [454] In a letter dated Iloilo,\r\nJanuary 22, 1905 (page 86), she says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Americans give out and write in their papers that the\r\n    Philippine Islands are completely pacified, and that the Filipinos\r\n    love Americans and their rule. This, doubtless with good motives,\r\n    is complete and utter humbug, for the country is honeycombed\r\n    with insurrection and plots; the fighting has never ceased; and\r\n    the natives loathe the Americans and their theories, saying so\r\n    openly in their native press and showing their dislike in every\r\n    possible fashion. Their one idea is to be rid of the U. S. A.\r\n    * * * and to be free of a burden of taxation which is heavier than\r\n    any the Spaniards laid on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso an Englishman who was in Samar in 1904-5, a Mr. Hyatt, who,\r\nwith his brother, served with the American troops there in the bloody\r\nPulajan uprising, afterwards wrote a book called the Little Brown\r\nBrother, wherein he fully corroborates Mrs. Dauncey's appreciation\r\nof the situation during that period.\r\n\r\nIn its blindness to the unanimity of Visayan discontent, as manifested\r\nin its report now under consideration, the civil government of\r\nthe Philippines was not trying wilfully to deceive anybody. It was\r\ndeceiving itself. It was obeying the law of its life, its existence\r\nhaving been originally predicated on the consent of a great free\r\npeople to keep in subjection a weaker people eager to be also free,\r\nsuch consent having been obtained through diligent nursing of the\r\noriginal idea that the subject people were not in fact so eager, but\r\nwere, on the contrary, in a mental attitude of tearful welcome toward\r\nthe proffered protection of a strong power. In his report for 1905\r\n[455] General William H. Carter, commanding the Department of the\r\nPhilippines which included Samar and the rest of the Visayan Islands,\r\ngives the key to the Commission's twenty-six-day stay in his district\r\nin the following part of said report:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Within a few days after the rendition of the annual report for\r\n    last year [456] a serious outbreak occurred in the Gandara valley,\r\n    Samar. This was followed by disorders in all the other large\r\n    islands of the department, Negros, Panay, Cebu, and Leyte.\r\n\r\n\r\nNowhere in the civil government reports do you find the slightest\r\nrecognition that these disorders had any relation to each other, or to\r\nthe fundamental problem of public order, or any political significance\r\nwhatsoever, each being treated as a purely local issue, the idea that\r\nthe circumstance of Samar's having been thrown into pandemonium by\r\nthe successes of the enemies of the American Government might have\r\nencouraged its enemies in the neighboring islands, never seeming to\r\noccur to the authors of the said reports. General Carter's report goes\r\non to state that within five months after the Samar outbreak of July,\r\n1904, seven hundred native troops had been put in the field in that\r\nturbulent island. In December, 1904, troops began to be poured into\r\nSamar, so that it was not long before the seven hundred native troops\r\nhad become seventeen hundred or eighteen hundred, and, says General\r\nCarter, \"in order to free them from garrison work in the towns, sixteen\r\ncompanies of the 12th and 14th Infantry were distributed about the\r\ndisaffected coasts to enable the people who so desired to come from\r\ntheir hiding places\"--whither they had gone because the American flag\r\nafforded them no protection--\"and undertake the rebuilding of their\r\nburned homes.\" General Carter avoids touching on the civil government's\r\n(to him well-known) obsession about its popularity, a state of mind\r\nwhich could see no \"political\" significance in outbreaks of any\r\nkind. But he does use this very straightforward language about Samar:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whatever may have been the original cause of the outbreak, it was\r\n    soon lost sight of when success had drawn a large proportion of\r\n    the people away from their homes and fields. * * * Except in the\r\n    largest towns it became simply a question of joining the Pulajans\r\n    or being harried by them. In the absence of proper protection\r\n    thousands joined in the movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly in 1905, Hon. George Curry, of New Mexico, who was an officer\r\nof Colonel Roosevelt's regiment in Cuba, and had gone out to the\r\nPhilippines with a volunteer regiment in 1899, remaining with the\r\ncivil Government after 1901, was made Governor of Samar. Governor\r\nCurry has since been Governor of the Territory of New Mexico,\r\nand is now (1912) a member of Congress from the recently admitted\r\nState of New Mexico. Governor Curry has told me since he was\r\nelected to Congress that it took him all of 1905 and most of\r\n1906, aided by several thousand troops, native and regular, to\r\nput down that Samar outbreak. Yet a certificate signed March 28,\r\n1907, by the Governor-General and his associates of the Philippine\r\nCommission states that \"a condition of general and complete peace\"\r\nhad continued in the Islands for two years previous to the date\r\nof the certificate. [457] We will come to this certificate in its\r\nchronological order later. How many and what sort of uprisings were\r\nblanketed in that \"forget-it\" certificate of 1907 is material to the\r\nquestion whether or not the National Administration has ever been or\r\nis now frank with the country about the universality of the desire of\r\nthe Philippine people for independence and local self-government, and\r\npertinent to the insistently recurring query: \"Why should we make of\r\nthe Philippines an American Ireland?\" But inasmuch as, in addition to\r\nthe Samar uprising which raged all through 1905, another insurrection\r\noccurred in that year, which was duly \"forgotten\" by said certificate,\r\nthis last movement must now claim our attention.\r\n\r\nThe provinces which were the theatre of the outbreak last above\r\nmentioned were all near Manila. They were: Cavite, a province of\r\n135,000 people almost at the gates of Manila; Batangas, a province of\r\n257,000 inhabitants adjoining Cavite; and Laguna, a province of 150,000\r\npeople adjoining both. Some five hundred brigands headed by cut-throats\r\nclaiming to be patriots were terrorizing whole districts. Far be it\r\nfrom me to lend any countenance to the idea that the leaders of this\r\nmovement, Sakay, Felizardo, Montalon, and the rest of their gang,\r\nwere entitled to any respect. But they certainly had a hold on\r\nthe whole population akin to that of Robin Hood, Little John, and\r\nFriar Tuck. In refusing in 1907 to commute Sakay's death sentence\r\nafter he was captured, tried, and convicted, Governor-General James\r\nP. Smith gives some gruesome details concerning the performance of\r\nthat worthy, and his followers, yet in dealing with the nature and\r\nextent of the trouble they gave the Manila government he says they\r\n\"assumed the convenient cloak of patriotism, and under the titles of\r\n'Defenders of the Country' and 'Protectors of the People' proceeded\r\nto inaugurate a reign of terror, devastation, and ruin in three of\r\nthe most beautiful provinces in the archipelago.\" [458]\r\n\r\nIt has already been made clear that, during the time of the\r\ninsurrection against both the Spaniards and Americans, the insurrecto\r\nforces were maintained by voluntary contributions of the people. Major\r\nD. C. Shanks, Fourth U. S. Regular Infantry, who was Governor of Cavite\r\nProvince in 1905, after calling attention to this fact, adds [459]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When the insurrection was over a number of these leaders remained\r\n    out and refused to surrender. Included among them were Felizardo\r\n    and Montalon. The system of voluntary contributions, carried on\r\n    during the insurrecto period, was continued after establishment\r\n    of civil government.\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain Governor Shanks says, with more of frankness than diplomacy,\r\nconsidering that he was a provincial governor under the civil\r\ngovernment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The establishment of civil government of this province was\r\n    premature and ill-advised. Records show the capture or surrender\r\n    since establishment of civil government of nearly 600 hostile\r\n    firearms.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the causes contributory to the Cavite-Batangas-Laguna\r\ninsurrection is stated in the report of the Governor-General for\r\n1905 thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In the autumn of 1904 it became necessary to withdraw a number\r\n    of the constabulary from these provinces to assist in suppressing\r\n    disorder which had broken out in the province of Samar. [460]\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother of the contributory causes is thus stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There was at the time [the fall of 1904] also considerable activity\r\n    among the small group of irreconcilables in Manila, who began\r\n    agitating for immediate independence, doubtless because of the\r\n    supposed effect it would have on the presidential election in\r\n    the United States, in which the Philippines was a large topic\r\n    of discussion. Evidently this was regarded as a favorable time\r\n    for a demonstration by Felizardo, Montalon, De Vega, Oruga, Sakay\r\n    [etc]. All these men had been officers of the Filipino army during\r\n    the insurrection.\r\n\r\n\r\nConsider the benevolent casuistry necessary to include these fellows,\r\nand the tremendous following they could get up, and did get up, in\r\nCavite, \"the home of insurrection,\" and the adjacent provinces, in a\r\ncertificate to \"a condition of general and complete peace\" alleged\r\nin the certificate to have prevailed for two years prior to March\r\n28, 1907. To make a long story short, on January 31, 1905, a state\r\nof insurrection was declared to exist, the writ of habeas corpus was\r\nsuspended in Cavite and Batangas, the regular army of the United States\r\nwas ordered out, and reconcentration tactics resorted to, as provided\r\nby Section 6 of Act 781 of the Commission. This is the act already\r\nexamined at length, intended to meet cases of impotency on the part\r\nof the insular government to protect life and property in any other\r\nway. Political timidity is conspicuously absent from the resolution of\r\nthe Philippine Commission of January 31, 1905, formally recognizing\r\na break in the peerless continuity of the \"general and complete\r\npeace.\" It is virilely frank, the presidential election being then\r\nsafely over. [461] It concludes by authorizing the Governor-General\r\nto suspend the writ of habeas corpus and declare martial law, \"the\r\npublic safety requiring it.\" Then follows a proclamation of the same\r\ndate and tenor, by the Governor-General.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the case cited in the foot-note that in the spring of\r\n1905, one, Felix Barcelon, filed in the proper court a petition for the\r\nwrit of habeas corpus, alleging that he was one of the reconcentrados\r\ncorralled and \"detained and restrained of his liberty at the town of\r\nBatangas, in the province of Batangas,\" by one of Colonel Baker's\r\nconstabulary minions down there. The writ was denied by the lower\r\ncourt. In one part of the opinion of the Supreme Court in the case it\r\nis stated (p. 116) that the petitioner \"has been detained for a long\r\ntime * * * not for the commission of any crime and by due process of\r\nlaw, but apparently for the purpose of protecting him.\" The opinion of\r\nthe court, delivered by Mr. Justice Johnson, very properly held that\r\nthe detention was lawful under the war power, basing its decision on\r\nthe authority conferred on the Governor-General of the Philippines\r\nby the Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, section 5 of which expressly\r\nauthorizes the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus \"when in\r\ncases of rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety may\r\nrequire it.\" A long legal battle was fought, the court holding that the\r\nExecutive Department of the Government is the one in which is vested\r\nthe exclusive right to say when \"a state of rebellion, insurrection,\r\nor invasion\" exists, and that when it so formally declares, that\r\nsettles the fact that it does exist. At page 98 of the volume above\r\ncited [462] the court held, as to the above mentioned resolution of\r\nthe Philippine Commission and the above mentioned executive order\r\ndeclaring a state of insurrection in Cavite and Batangas:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The conclusion set forth in the said resolution and the said\r\n    executive order, as to the fact that there existed in the provinces\r\n    of Cavite and Batangas open insurrection against the constituted\r\n    authorities, was a conclusion entirely within the discretion of\r\n    the legislative and executive branches of the Government, after\r\n    an investigation of the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nYet two years later the same \"constituted authorities\" certified to\r\nthe President of the United States, in effect, as we shall see, that\r\nno open insurrection against the constituted authorities had occurred\r\nduring the preceding two years. They do not in their certificate\r\nignore Cavite and Batangas. They mention them by name, with a lot\r\nof whereases, explaining that after all they really believe that the\r\nmajority of the people in the provinces aforesaid were not in sympathy\r\nwith the uprising. However, after they get through with their whereases\r\nthey face the music squarely, and certify to \"the condition of general\r\nand complete peace.\" Of the \"nigger in the woodpile\" more anon.\r\n\r\nGovernor Wright was not a party to the certificate of 1907. He\r\nleft the Islands on leave November 4, 1905. A speech made by him\r\nprior to his departure, as published in a Manila paper, indicates\r\nan expectation to return. He never did. In 1906 he was demoted to be\r\nAmbassador to Japan, a place of far less dignity, and far less salary,\r\nwhich he resigned after a year or so. Vice-Governor Ide acted as\r\nGovernor-General until April 2, 1906, on which date he was formally\r\ninaugurated as Governor-General.\r\n\r\nJust why Governor Wright did not go back to the Philippines as\r\nGovernor, after his visit to the United States in 1905-6, does\r\nnot appear. It would seem almost certain that if Secretary of War\r\nTaft had wanted President Roosevelt to send him back, he would have\r\ngone. Mr. Taft never did frankly tell the Filipinos until 1907 that\r\nthey might just as well shut up talking about any independence that\r\nanybody living might hope to see. Governor Wright began to talk that\r\nway soon after Mr. Taft left the Islands. Possibly Governor Wright\r\nundeceived them too soon, and thereby made the Philippines more of\r\na troublesome issue in the presidential campaign of 1904. President\r\nRoosevelt recognized the sterling worth of the man, by inviting\r\nhim to succeed Mr. Taft as Secretary of War in 1908. But President\r\nTaft did not invite him to continue in that capacity after March 4,\r\n1909. Gossip has it that when the incoming President Taft's letter\r\nto the outgoing President Roosevelt's last Secretary of War, Governor\r\nWright, was handed to the addressee, and its conventional \"hope to be\r\nable to avail myself of your services later in some other capacity\"\r\nwas read by him, the outgoing official quietly remarked: \"Well, that\r\nis a little more round-about than the one Jimmie Garfield [463] got,\r\nbut it's a dismissal just the same.\"\r\n\r\nI have always thought that the reason Governor Wright did not go back\r\nto the Philippines as Governor after 1905 was that he did not continue\r\nto \"jolly\" the Filipinos, and abstain from ruthlessly crushing their\r\nhopes of seeing independence during their lifetime, as Mr. Taft did\r\ncontinuously during his stay out there. The inevitable tendency of\r\nthe Wright frank talk was from the beginning to discredit the Taft\r\npleasing and evasive nothings. Also, it was followed, as we have seen,\r\nby quite a crop of serious disturbances of public order, and somebody\r\nhad to be \"the goat.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR IDE--1906\r\n\r\n                                The Tariff is a local issue.\r\n\r\n                                                  General W. S. Hancock.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Governor Wright left the Islands finally on November 4, 1905,\r\nVice-Governor Henry C. Ide acted as Governor-General until April 2,\r\n1906, when he was duly inaugurated as such. He resigned and left the\r\nIslands finally in September thereafter.\r\n\r\nAll through 1905, Governor Curry, as Governor of Samar, which is the\r\nthird largest island of the archipelago, wrestled with the Pulajan\r\nuprising there, aided, as has been stated in the previous chapter,\r\nby the native troops, scouts, and constabulary, and also by the\r\nregular army. But at the end of 1905 \"the situation\" was not yet\r\n\"well in hand.\" Since his election to Congress in 1912, Governor\r\nCurry has told me that in 1905 many thousands of people of Samar\r\nparticipated actively as part of the enemy's force in the field during\r\nthat period. By the spring of 1906 Governor Curry was getting a grip\r\non the situation, and in the latter part of March of that year, some\r\nof the main outlaw chiefs agreed to surrender to him. The report of\r\nColonel Wallace C. Taylor, commanding the constabulary of the Third\r\nDistrict, which included Samar states [464]: \"After several weeks of\r\nnegotiating, during which time the camp of the Pulahanes was visited\r\nby Governor Curry, and the Pulahan officers visited the settlement\r\nat Magtaon\"--a settlement in south central Samar--\"an understanding\r\nwas arrived at by which the Pulahanes were to surrender, March 24,\r\n1906. Instead of surrendering as agreed, the Pulahanes, commanded by\r\nNasario Aguilar, made a treacherous attack on the constabulary garrison\r\non the day and hour appointed for the surrender.\" The constabulary\r\nnumbered some fifty men, the pulajans about 130. After the pulajans\r\nopened fire they made a rush on the constabulary and a hand-to-hand\r\nfight ensued. Colonel Taylor's report continues:\r\n\r\n\r\n    After the first rush the fighting continued fiercely, and when\r\n    the last of the pulahanes disappeared there remained but seven\r\n    enlisted men of the constabulary able to fight. Seven more were\r\n    lying about more or less seriously wounded and twenty-two were\r\n    dead. Captain Jones received a bad spear thrust in the chest early\r\n    in the fight, but fought on, regardless. Lieutenant Bowers received\r\n    a gunshot wound through the left arm, which, however, did not put\r\n    him out of the fight. Thirty-five dead pulahanes were found on the\r\n    field and eight more have since been found some distance off. The\r\n    number of wounded who escaped cannot be determined. The unarmed\r\n    Americans present with Governor Curry escaped to the river and\r\n    afterwards rejoined Captain Jones who armed them.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe explanation of this treachery, as given by Governor Curry, is\r\ncurious and interesting. The outlaws had intended in good faith to\r\nsurrender as a result of his negotiation with them, but at the last\r\nmoment there arrived to witness the surrender certain native officials\r\nand other natives bitterly hated by the Pulajans and wholly mistrusted\r\nby them. Their arrival caused the outlaws to suspect treachery\r\nthemselves and that was the cause of their change of plans. It was not\r\nuntil the end of the year 1906 that the various energetic campaigns\r\nwhich followed the Magtaon incident finally began to work more or\r\nless complete restoration of public order by gradual elimination of\r\nthe enemy through killings, captures, and surrenders. An idea of the\r\nseriousness and magnitude of these operations may be gathered without\r\ngoing into the details, from the annual report for 1906 of General\r\nHenry T. Allen commanding the Philippines Constabulary. This report,\r\ndated August 31, 1906 [465], states:\r\n\r\n\r\n    At present seventeen companies of scouts and four companies of\r\n    American troops under Colonel Smith, 8th U. S. Infantry, are\r\n    operating against the pulahanes, but with success that will be\r\n    largely dependent upon time and attrition.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Allen adds: \"The entire 21st Regiment [of Infantry] is also in\r\nSamar.\" These facts are here given because they relate to the period\r\ncovered by the certificate of the Philippine Commission of March 28,\r\n1907, heretofore alluded to, and which will be more fully dealt with\r\nhereinafter, which stated that \"a condition of general and complete\r\npeace\" had prevailed throughout the archipelago for two years prior\r\nto March 28, 1907. Without a brief exposition of all these matters,\r\nit would be impossible to enable the reader to feel the pulse of\r\nthe Filipino people as it stood at the time of the election of their\r\nassembly in 1907. The fact of our having been unable to discontinue\r\nFilipino-killing altogether for any considerable period from 1899 to\r\nthe end of 1906 is too obviously relevant to the state of the public\r\nmind in 1907 to need elaboration.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1906 [466] deals at some\r\nlength with disturbances which occurred in the island of Leyte (area\r\n3000 square miles, population nearly 400,000), beginning in the middle\r\nof June. It describes among other things a visit of Governor-General\r\nIde to Tacloban, the capital of Leyte, made in consequence of said\r\ndisturbances, and conferences held by him there with Major-General\r\nWood, commanding all the United States forces in the Philippines,\r\nBrigadier-General Lee, commanding the Department of the Visayas (which\r\nincluded Leyte, headquarters, Iloilo), Colonel Borden, commanding\r\nthe United States forces in the island of Leyte, Colonel Taylor, the\r\nchief of the constabulary of the District, etc. Certainly from this\r\nformidable gathering of notables, it is clear that there was about to\r\ntake place in Leyte what our friends of the Lambs' Club in New York\r\nwould call \"An all star performance.\" Leyte was four to five hundred\r\nmiles from Manila. Yet so serious was the disturbance that the highest\r\nmilitary and civil representatives of the American Government in the\r\narchipelago deemed it necessary to meet in the island which was the\r\nscene of the trouble with a view of handling it. Yet in the Report of\r\nthe Philippine Commission for 1906 one finds the usual rotund rhetoric\r\ntreating the disturbances as of no \"political\" significance--which\r\nwas only another way of claiming that they were not serious. It\r\nis difficult to handle this aspect of the matter without imputing\r\nto the civil authorities intent to deceive, but to leave such an\r\nimputation unremoved would be to miss the whole significance of the\r\nmatter. As has already been made clear, when Judge Taft, Judge Ide,\r\nand their colleagues of the Philippine Commission had left Washington\r\nfor Manila in 1900 Mr. McKinley had assured them he had no doubt that\r\nthe better element of the Philippine people, once they understood us,\r\nwould welcome our rule. As soon as they set foot in the Philippine\r\nIslands they had at once begun to act upon the theory that there was\r\nno real fundamental opposition to us on the part of the people of\r\nthe Philippines and had continued obstinately to act upon that theory\r\never since. Certainly the attitude of the civil government toward the\r\ndisturbances in Leyte in 1906 is not surprising when the mind adverts\r\nfor a moment to the panorama of the five more or less sanguinary years\r\nalready fully described hereinbefore and then takes the following\r\nbird's-eye glance at the official reports for those years.\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1900, (page 17) had said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A great majority of the people long for peace and are entirely\r\n    willing to accept the establishment of a government under the\r\n    supremacy of the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1901 (page 7) had said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The collapse of the insurrection came in May.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1902 (page 3) had said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The insurrection as an organized attempt to subvert the authority\r\n    of the United States in these islands is entirely at an end,\r\n\r\n\r\nreferring farther on to \"the whole Christian Philippine population\"\r\nas \"enjoying civil government.\" If the \"enjoyment\" thus described had\r\nbeen genuine, continued, profound, and sincere, it would have been\r\nanother story. But the net attitude of the civil government toward\r\nthe general health of the body politic, relatively to public order,\r\nreminds one of the cheerful gentleman who remarked of his invalid\r\nfriend, \"He seems to be 'enjoying' poor health.\"\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1903 (page 25) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The conditions with respect to tranquillity in the islands have\r\n    greatly improved during the last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1904 (page 1) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The great mass of the people, however, were domestic and peaceable.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1905 (part 1, page 59)\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\r\n    On the whole life and property have been as safe as in other\r\n    civilized countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Report of the Philippine Commission for 1906 (page 40) says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Viewing the entire situation the islands are in a peaceable and\r\n    orderly condition aside from----\r\n\r\n\r\nvarious disorders which fill some ten pages of the report.\r\n\r\nThe inflexible attitude of the Commission from the beginning, of\r\ntreating each successive disturbance of public order as a purely\r\n\"local issue,\" after General Hancock's method with the tariff,\r\nis thus sufficiently apparent. They always refuse to see in\r\nsuccessive outbreaks in various parts of the Islands any evidence\r\nof general and unanimous lack of appreciation for a benign alien\r\ncivil government. Therefore it was of course clearly a foregone\r\nconclusion, in 1906, that Governor Ide, who had been in the Islands\r\nall these years, was going to be wholly unable to see anything in the\r\ndisturbances in Leyte in the least tending to show that American rule\r\nwas unpopular. And yet it was a matter of common knowledge all over\r\nthe Visayan Islands that Jaime Veyra, then Governor of Leyte, elected\r\nby the people, was one of the most obnoxious anti-Americans in the\r\narchipelago. Both the army and constabulary were ordered out in Leyte\r\nand a good deal of fighting occurred before order was restored. The\r\nreport of General Allen, commanding the constabulary for that year\r\n[467] shows one engagement with the outlaws in Leyte participated\r\nin by the constabulary and the 21st Regular Infantry, in which the\r\nenemy numbered 450 and left forty-nine dead upon the field. All\r\nthis period is covered by the certificate of general and complete\r\npeace of 1907, in the fall of which year a Philippine legislature\r\nwas elected. And those of the membership of that body not in favor\r\nof Philippine independence were almost as few as the Socialist party\r\nin the American House of Representatives, which, I believe, consists\r\nof Representative Berger. True, the peace certificate does not ignore\r\nthe Leyte outbreak. It \"forgets and forgives it,\" so to speak, as we\r\nshall see.\r\n\r\nGovernor Ide left the Islands finally on September 20, 1906, having\r\nresigned. Why he should have resigned, it is difficult to say. Take\r\nit all in all, he made a splendid Governor-General, and ought to\r\nhave been allowed to remain. He knew the Islands from Alpha to Omega\r\nand had been there six years. His going out of office to make way\r\nfor still another Governor-General was wholly uncalled for. So far\r\nas the writer is informed, he was, when he left, still blessed with\r\ngood health. He had filled a very considerable place in the history\r\nof his country most creditably. He had drawn up a fine code of laws\r\nfor the Islands known as the Ide code. He had made a great minister of\r\nfinance, successfully performing the perilous task of transferring the\r\ncurrency of the country from a silver basis to a gold basis, and in so\r\ndoing had proven himself fully a match, in protecting the interests\r\nof the Government, for the wiley local financiers representing the\r\nHong Kong and Shanghai Bank, the chartered bank of India, Australia,\r\nand China, and other institutions run by experienced men of more or\r\nless piratical tendencies. As Governor-General of the Islands, his\r\njustice, firmness, and courtliness of manner combined to produce an\r\nadministration in keeping with the dignity of his great office. After\r\nreturning to the United States, he remained in private life for a time,\r\nand was finally given a comparatively unimportant post as minister to\r\na second-class country, Spain, which post he still occupies (in 1912).\r\n\r\nWhen, fresh from the memory of the Samar massacres of 1904, I landed\r\nat Seattle, at the end of my last homeward-bound journey across the\r\nPacific, in April, 1905, one of the \"natives\" of Seattle asked me:\r\n\"Have those people over there ever got quiet yet?\" The question itself\r\nseemed an answer to the orthodox official attitude at Manila, which had\r\nso long been elaborately denying, as to each successive local outbreak,\r\nthat such outbreak bore any relation to the original insurrection,\r\nor was any wise illustrative of the general state of public feeling\r\nin the Islands. At the time the question was asked, the answer was,\r\n\"Not entirely.\" Not until toward the end of 1906 did \"Yes\" become\r\na correct answer to the question. In other words, there were no\r\nmore serious outbreaks after 1906, nor was a state of general and\r\ncomplete peace ever finally established until then. Since 1906 there\r\nhave been occasional despatches from Manila recounting small episodes\r\nof bloodshed, several of which have had quite a martial ring. These\r\nhave related merely to the country of the Mohammedan Moros, who are\r\nas wholly apart from the main problem as the American Indian to-day\r\nis from our tariff and other like questions. The Moros are indeed\r\nwhat Kipling calls \"half savage and half child.\" They never did have\r\nanything more to do with the Filipino insurrection against us than\r\nthe American Indian had to do with the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SMITH--1907-9\r\n\r\n        Oh, but Honey, dis rabbit dess 'bleeged ter climb dis tree.\r\n\r\n                                                            Uncle Remus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"On September 20, 1906,\" says the Report of the Philippine Commission\r\nfor 1907, [468] \"the resignation of the Hon. Henry Clay Ide as\r\nGovernor-General became effective, and on that date the Hon. James\r\nF. Smith was inaugurated as Governor-General of the Philippine\r\nIslands.\"\r\n\r\nThe year 1907 will be known most prominently to the future history of\r\nour Far Eastern possession as the year of the opening of the Philippine\r\nAssembly, which momentous event occurred on October 16th. But in the\r\ndepartments both of Politics and Psychology it should be known as the\r\nyear of the Great Certificate. The Great Certificate was a certificate\r\nsigned by certain eminent gentlemen on March 28, 1907, which made the\r\npreposterous affirmation that a condition of general and complete\r\npeace had prevailed throughout the archipelago, except among the\r\nnon-Christian tribes, for the two years immediately preceding. Taken\r\nin its historic setting, that certificate can by no possibility escape\r\nresponsibility, as \"accessory after the fact\" at least, to the pretence\r\nthat a similar condition had prevailed ever since President Roosevelt's\r\nfinal war-whoop of July 4, 1902, published to the American troops in\r\nthe Islands on the day named. That war-whoop, it will be remembered,\r\nwas in the form of a presidential proclamation congratulating General\r\nChaffee and \"the gallant officers and men under his command\" on some\r\n\"two thousand combats, great and small,\" and declaring, in effect,\r\nthat Benevolent Assimilation was at last triumphantly vindicated,\r\nand that opposition to American rule was at an end. The certificate of\r\nMarch 28, 1907, appears at pages 47-8 of the Report of the Philippine\r\nCommission for 1907, part 1. If we consider what is now going on in\r\nthe Islands as \"modern\" history, and the days of the early fighting as\r\n\"ancient\" history, this certificate will serve as the connecting link\r\nbetween the two. It furnishes the key-note to all that had happened\r\nduring the American occupation prior to 1907, and the key-note of\r\nall that has happened since. Therefore, though somewhat long, it is\r\ndeemed indispensable to clearness to submit here in full the text of\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE GREAT CERTIFICATE OF 1907\r\n\r\n    Whereas the census of the Philippine Islands was completed and\r\n    published on the twenty-seventh day of March, nineteen hundred and\r\n    five, which said completion and publication of said census was,\r\n    on the twenty-eighth day of March, nineteen hundred and five, duly\r\n    published and proclaimed to the people by the governor-general of\r\n    the Philippine Islands with the announcement that the President\r\n    of the United States would direct the Philippine Commission to\r\n    call a general election for the choice of delegates to a popular\r\n    assembly, provided that a condition of general and complete peace\r\n    with recognition of the authority of the United States should be\r\n    certified by the Philippine Commission to have continued in the\r\n    territory of the Philippine Islands for a period of two years\r\n    after said completion and publication of said census; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas since the completion and publication of said census there\r\n    have been no serious disturbances of the public order save and\r\n    except those caused by the noted outlaws and bandit chieftains,\r\n    Felizardo and Montalon, and their followers in the provinces of\r\n    Cavite and Batangas, and those caused in the provinces of Samar\r\n    and Leyte by the non-Christian and fanatical pulahanes resident\r\n    in the mountain districts of the said provinces and the barrios\r\n    contiguous thereto; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas the overwhelming majority of the people of said provinces\r\n    of Cavite, Batangas, Samar, and Leyte have not taken part in said\r\n    disturbances and have not aided or abetted the lawless acts of\r\n    said bandits and pulahanes; and\r\n\r\n    Whereas the great mass and body of the Filipino people have,\r\n    during said period of two years, continued to be law-abiding,\r\n    peaceful, and loyal to the United States, and have continued to\r\n    recognize and do now recognize the authority and sovereignty of\r\n    the United States in the territory of said Philippine Islands:\r\n    Now, therefore, be it\r\n\r\n    Resolved by the Philippine Commission in formal session duly\r\n    assembled, That it, said Philippine Commission, do certify, and it\r\n    does hereby certify, to the President of the United States that for\r\n    a period of two years after the completion and publication of the\r\n    census a condition of general and complete peace, with recognition\r\n    of the authority of the United States, has continued to exist\r\n    and now exists in the territory of said Philippine Islands not\r\n    inhabited by Moros or other non-Christian tribes; and be it further\r\n\r\n    Resolved by said Philippine Commission, That the President of the\r\n    United States be requested, and is hereby requested, to direct\r\n    said Philippine Commission to call a general election for the\r\n    choice of delegates to a popular assembly of the people of said\r\n    territory in the Philippine Islands, which assembly shall be\r\n    known as the Philippine Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us examine these amiable liberties thus taken with the facts of\r\nhistory by men of irreproachable private character, briefly analyzing\r\ntheir action. Such an examination and analysis are indispensable to\r\na clear understanding by a great free people whose proudest boast is\r\nlove of fair play, of whether the Filipino people, or any appreciable\r\nfraction of them, have ever in the least consented, or do now in the\r\nleast consent, to our rule, as the small minority among us interested\r\nin keeping the Islands, have systematically sought, all these years,\r\nto have this nation believe. As the above certificate of 1907 was\r\nthe last hurdle that Benevolent Assimilation had to leap on the\r\nBenevolent Hypocrisy course over which we had to gallop in order to\r\nget from the freeing of Cuba to the subjugation of the Philippines,\r\nlet us glance back for a moment at the first hurdle or two, leapt\r\nwhen Mr. Taft was in the Philippine saddle.\r\n\r\nJudge Taft had said on November 30, 1900:\r\n\r\n\r\n    A great majority of the people long for peace and are entirely\r\n    willing to accept the establishment of a government under the\r\n    supremacy of the United States [469];\r\n\r\n\r\nand, pursuant to that idea, he had set up his civil government on July\r\n4, 1901. He never did thereafter admit that he was mistaken in his\r\noriginal theory, but kept on trying to fit the facts to his theory,\r\nhoping that after a while they would fit. He \"clung to his policy\r\nof disinterested benevolence with a tenacity born of conviction,\"\r\nto borrow a phrase from Governor-General Smith's inaugural address of\r\n1907. But in this same inaugural address of Governor Smith of 1907,\r\nyou find, for the first time in all the Philippine state papers,\r\na frank admission of the actual conditions under which the civil\r\ngovernment of 1901 was in fact set up. Says he:\r\n\r\n\r\n    While the smoke of battle still hung over the hills and valleys\r\n    of the Philippines and every town and barrio in the islands was\r\n    smoking hot with rebellion, she [the United States] replaced the\r\n    military with a civil regime and on the smouldering embers of\r\n    insurrection planted civil government. [470]\r\n\r\n\r\nThat confession, made with the bluntness of a most gallant soldier,\r\nis as refreshing in its honesty as the Roosevelt war-whoop of\r\n1902. There shall be no tiresome repetition here concerning the\r\noriginal withholding of the facts from the American people in 1898-9,\r\nbut to place in juxtaposition Secretary of War Root's representations\r\nto the American public in the year last named, and the actual facts\r\nas stated earlier in the same year by General MacArthur, one of\r\nour best fighting generals, during the thick of the early fighting,\r\nin an interview already noticed in its proper chronological place,\r\nwill forever fix the genesis of the original lack of frankness as to\r\nconditions in the Philippines which has naturally and inexorably made\r\nfrankness as to those conditions impossible ever since. As late as\r\nOctober 7, 1899, Mr. Root--who had not then and has not since been\r\nin the Philippines--had said in Chicago, in a speech at a dinner of\r\nthe Marquette Club:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Well, against whom are we fighting? Are we fighting the\r\n    Philippine nation? No. There is none. There are hundreds of\r\n    islands, inhabited by more than sixty tribes, speaking more than\r\n    sixty different languages, and all but one are ready to accept\r\n    American sovereignty.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as the beginning of April, 1899, just after the taking on\r\nMarch 31st of the first insurgent capital, Malolos, General MacArthur,\r\nwho commanded our troops in the assault on that place, had said, in\r\nan interview with a newspaper man afterwards verified by the General\r\nbefore the Senate Committee of 1902 as substantially correct:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When I first started in against these rebels, I believed that\r\n    Aguinaldo's troops represented only a faction. * * * I did not like\r\n    to believe that the whole population of Luzon * * * was opposed to\r\n    us * * *. But after having come thus far, and having been brought\r\n    much in contact with both insurrectos and amigos, [471] I have\r\n    been reluctantly compelled to believe that the Filipino masses\r\n    are loyal to Aguinaldo and the government which he heads. [472]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe presidential election of 1900 had been fought out, in the midst of\r\nconsiderable bitterness, on the idea that the Root view was correct\r\nand the MacArthur view was altogether mistaken. So that after 1900,\r\nthe McKinley Administration was irrevocably committed to the Root\r\nview. [473] The Philippine Government had, after 1900, diligently set\r\nto work to live up to the Root view, and to fit the facts to the Root\r\nview by prayer and hope, accompanied by asseveration. Hence in 1901 the\r\nalleged joyous sobs of welcome with which the Filipino people are, in\r\neffect, described in the report of the Philippine Commission for that\r\nyear as having received the \"benign\" civil government, said sobs or\r\nother manifestations having spread, if the Commission's report is to\r\nbe taken at its face value, \"like wild-fire.\" Hence also the attempt\r\nof 1902 to minimize the insurrection of 1901-2, in Batangas and other\r\nprovinces of southern Luzon, conducted by what Governor Luke E. Wright,\r\nin a speech delivered at Memphis in the latter part of 1902, called\r\n\"the die-in-the-last-ditch contingent.\" Hence the quiet placing of\r\nthe province of Surigao in the hands of the military in 1903 without\r\nsuspension of the writ of habeas corpus, and the failure to order\r\nout the army in Albay in 1903 and in Samar in 1904. Hence also the\r\nprompt use of the army in Samar, Batangas, and Cavite in 1905, after\r\nthe presidential election was safely over. Hence also the seething\r\nstate of sedition which smouldered in the Visayan Islands in 1906,\r\npunctuated by the outbreak in Leyte of that year.\r\n\r\nThe psychologic processes by which the distinguished gentlemen\r\nwho signed the Great Certificate of March 28, 1907, got their\r\nown consent to sign it make the most profoundly interesting study,\r\nrelatively to the general welfare of the world, in all our Philippine\r\nexperiments so far. They are the final flowering of the plant Political\r\nExpediency. They are the weeds of benevolent casuistry that become from\r\ntime to time unavoidable in a colonial garden tended by a republic\r\nbased on the consent of the governed and therefore by the law of its\r\nown life unfitted to run any other kind of a government frankly. These\r\nprocesses find their origin in the provisions of the Act of Congress\r\nof July 1, 1902, known as the Philippine Government Act. Three days\r\nafter President Roosevelt approved the Act, he issued his proclamation\r\nof July 4, 1902, above noticed, declaring the insurrection at an\r\nend. Section 6 of that Act provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Whenever the existing insurrection in the Philippine Islands shall\r\n    have ceased, and a condition of general and complete peace shall\r\n    have been established therein, and the fact shall be certified to\r\n    the President by the Philippine Commission, the President, upon\r\n    being satisfied thereof, shall order a census of the Philippine\r\n    Islands to be taken by said Philippine Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis census was intended to be preliminary to granting the Filipinos\r\na legislature of their own, but as a legislature full of insurrectos\r\nwould of course stultify its American sponsors before all mankind,\r\nit was announced in effect, in publishing the census programme, that\r\nno legislature would be forthcoming if the Filipinos did not quit\r\ninsurrecting, and remain \"good\" for two years. If they did remain good\r\nfor two years after the census was finished, then they should have\r\ntheir legislature. During the lull of \"general and complete\" peace\r\nwhich, in the fall of 1902, followed the suppression of the Batangas\r\ninsurrection of 1901-2, and preceded the Ola insurrection of 1902-3 in\r\nthe hemp provinces of southern Luzon, the Commission made, on September\r\n25, 1902, the certificate contemplated by the above Act of Congress,\r\nand the taking of the census was accordingly ordered by the President\r\nof the United States, Mr. Roosevelt, by a proclamation issued the\r\nsame day. [474] Section 7 of the aforesaid Act of Congress provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Two years after the completion and publication of the census, in\r\n    case such condition of general and complete peace with recognition\r\n    of the authority of the United States shall have continued in\r\n    the territory of said islands not inhabited by Moros or other\r\n    non-Christian tribes, and such facts shall have been certified\r\n    to the President by the Philippine Commission, the President\r\n    upon being satisfied thereof shall direct said Commission to\r\n    call, and the Commission shall call, a general election for the\r\n    choice of delegates to a popular assembly of the people of said\r\n    territory in the Philippine Islands, which shall be known as the\r\n    Philippine Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 27, 1905, the President of the United States was duly\r\nadvised that the census had been completed, and on March 28th,\r\nthe presidential proclamation promising the Filipinos a legislature\r\ntwo years later if in the meantime they did not insurrect any, was\r\nduly published at Manila. It is true that there is no Philippine\r\nstate paper signed by anybody, either by the President of the United\r\nStates, or the Governor-General of the Philippines, or any one else,\r\ncertifying to a condition of \"general and complete peace\" between\r\nthe certificate to that effect made by the Philippine Commission on\r\nSeptember 25, 1902, above mentioned, which authorized commencing the\r\ncensus (and was justified by the facts), and the presidential promise\r\nof March 28, 1905, that if they would \"be good\" for two years more,\r\nthey should have a legislature. But the whole manifest implication\r\nof the representations of fact sought to be conveyed by the action\r\nboth of the Washington and the Manila authorities at the date of the\r\npresidential promise of March 28, 1905, is that a condition of general\r\nand complete peace had obtained ever since the last certificate to that\r\neffect, the certificate of September 25, 1902. Yet, as we saw in the\r\nchapter covering the last year of Governor Wright's administration,\r\nbesides the Samar disturbances that lasted all through 1905, a big\r\ninsurrection was actually in full swing in Cavite, Batangas, and Laguna\r\nprovinces, on March 28, 1905, had then been in progress since before\r\nthe first of the year, and continued until the latter part of 1905,\r\nthe then Governor-General, Governor Wright, having, by proclamation\r\nissued January 31, 1905, declared Cavite and Batangas to be in a\r\nstate of insurrection, ordered the military into those provinces, and\r\nsuspended the writ of habeas corpus. President Roosevelt's proclamation\r\nof March 28, 1905, can by no possibility be construed as saying to\r\nthe Filipinos anything other than substantially this: \"You have not\r\ninsurrected any since my proclamation of July 4, 1902. If you will be\r\ngood two years more, you shall have a legislature.\" What then was the\r\nPhilippine Commission to do at the end of those two years, peppered,\r\nas they had been, with most annoying outbreaks in various provinces\r\nnot inhabited by \"Moros or other non-Christian tribes.\" During the\r\npresidential campaign of 1904 the Commission had committed themselves,\r\nas we have seen, to the proposition that nothing serious was going\r\non at that time in Samar. So how could they take frank official\r\ncognizance on paper of the reign of terror let loose there by their\r\ndelay in ordering out the army until after the presidential election,\r\na delay which, like a delay of fire-engines to arrive at the scene of\r\na fire, had permitted the Samar outbreak to gain such headway that it\r\ntook two years to finally put it down? Then there was the outbreak\r\nof 1906 in Leyte, described in the last chapter, as to which even\r\nthe Commission had admitted in their annual report for that year [475]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Possibly its [Leyte's] immediate vicinity to Samar has had to do\r\n    with the disturbed conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn other words, possibly, a fire may spread from one field of dry\r\ngrass to another near by.\r\n\r\nAs to the Cavite-Batangas-Laguna insurrection of 1905, in an executive\r\norder dated September 28, 1907, [476]--noticed in a previous chapter,\r\nbut too pertinent to be entirely omitted here--wherein are set forth\r\nthe reasons for withholding executive clemency from the condemned\r\nleaders of that movement, Governor-General Smith describes in harrowing\r\nterms \"a reign of terror, devastation, and ruin in three of the most\r\nbeautiful provinces in the archipelago,\" wrought by the condemned\r\nmen, who he says \"assumed the cloak of patriotism, and under the\r\ntitles of 'Defenders of the Country,' and 'Protectors of the People'\r\nproceeded to inaugurate\" said reign of terror. These men were most\r\nof them former insurgent officers who had remained out after the\r\nrespectable generals had all surrendered. This Cavite-Batangas-Laguna\r\ninsurrection was the very sort of thing which the conditional promise\r\nof a legislature made by Congress to the Filipino people in Sections 6\r\nand 7 of the Act of July 1, 1902--the Philippine Government Act--had\r\nstipulated should not happen. This is no mere dictum of my own. In\r\nthe case of Barcelon against Baker, 5 Philippine Reports, pp. 87 et\r\nseq., already very briefly noticed in a previous chapter, the Supreme\r\nCourt of the Islands had, in effect, so held. Section 5 of the Act of\r\nCongress of July 1, 1902, had provided that if any state of affairs\r\nserious enough should arise, the Governor of the Philippines should\r\nhave authority to suspend the writ of habeas corpus \"when in cases\r\nof rebellion, insurrection, or invasion the public safety may require\r\nit.\" Sections 6 and 7 of the same Act had provided, on the other hand,\r\nthat if a condition of general and complete peace should prevail for\r\na stated period the Filipinos should have a legislature. In the case\r\nof Barcelon against Baker the Supreme Court held that the situation\r\ncontemplated by Section 5 of the Act of Congress had arisen in the\r\nprovinces of Cavite and Batangas. That, of course, automatically, so\r\nto speak, made the postponement of the Philippine Assembly a necessary\r\nlogical sequence, under the provisions of Sections 6 and 7. These\r\nSections 6 and 7 promised the Filipinos a legislature in the event\r\nthe conditions contemplated by Section 5 should not arise. Barcelon,\r\nwho was one of the (non-combatant) reconcentrados restrained of his\r\nliberty at Batangas, claimed that his detention as such reconcentrado\r\nby the defendant in the habeas corpus proceeding, the constabulary\r\nofficer, Colonel Baker, was unlawful, in that, he being charged with\r\nno crime, such detention deprived him of his liberty without due\r\nprocess of law. The Philippine Commission, however, had declared,\r\nby virtue of the authority vested in it by Section 5 of the Act of\r\nCongress aforesaid, that a state of insurrection existed in Cavite and\r\nBatangas, and accordingly the Governor-General had suspended the writ\r\nof habeas corpus and declared martial law in those provinces. The\r\nAttorney-General representing the Philippine Commission before\r\nthe court rested the Government's case on the proposition that the\r\npetitioner was not entitled to claim the ordinary \"due process of\r\nlaw\" because \"open insurrection against the constituted authorities\"\r\nexisted in the provinces named. And the Supreme Court upheld his\r\ncontention. In so holding, they say, among other things (page 93),\r\nin construing Section 5 of the Act of Congress we are considering:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Inasmuch as the President, or Governor-General with the approval\r\n    of the Philippine Commission, can suspend the privilege of the\r\n    writ of habeas corpus only under the conditions mentioned in the\r\n    said statute, it becomes their duty to make an investigation of\r\n    the existing conditions in the archipelago, or any part thereof,\r\n    to ascertain whether there actually exists a state of rebellion,\r\n    insurrection, or invasion, and that the public safety requires the\r\n    suspension of the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus. When\r\n    this investigation is concluded, and the President, or the\r\n    Governor-General with the consent of the Philippine Commission,\r\n    declares that there exists these conditions, and that the public\r\n    safety requires the suspension of the privilege of the writ of\r\n    habeas corpus, can the judicial department of the Government\r\n    investigate the same facts and declare that no such conditions\r\n    exist?\r\n\r\n\r\nThey answer \"No!\" The head note of the decision is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The privilege of the writ of habeas corpus may be suspended in\r\n    the Philippine Islands in the case of rebellion, insurrection,\r\n    and invasion, when the public safety requires it, by the President\r\n    of the United States, or by the Governor-General of the Philippine\r\n    Islands with the approval of the Philippine Commission.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus the Supreme Court of the Islands squarely held that on the\r\nfourth day of August, 1905 (the day the writ of habeas corpus\r\nwas made returnable), open insurrection existed against the\r\nconstituted authorities in the Islands, in the provinces named,\r\nand had existed since the Executive Proclamation of January 31st,\r\nprevious, declaring a state of insurrection, and on that ground denied\r\nthe writ. Yet the Commission certified on March 28, 1907, that a state\r\nof general and complete peace as contemplated by the Act of Congress\r\nconditionally promising a legislature, had prevailed for the two\r\nyears preceding. In other words the Philippine Commission declared\r\na state of insurrection to exist in certain populous provinces, and\r\nwas upheld by the Supreme Court of the Islands in so doing, and later\r\ncertified to the continuance of a state of general and complete peace\r\ncovering the same period.\r\n\r\nAll the uncandid things--uncandid in failure to take the American\r\npeople into their confidence--that have been done by all the good men\r\nwe have sent to the Philippines from the beginning, have been justified\r\nby those good men to their own consciences on the idea that, because\r\nthe end in view was truly benevolent, therefore the end justified the\r\nmeans. As a matter of fact, American Benevolent Assimilation in the\r\nPhilippines has, in its practical operation, worked more of misery and\r\nhavoc, first through war, and since through legislation put or kept on\r\nthe statute books by the influence of special interests in the United\r\nStates with Congress, \"than any which has darkened their unhappy past\"\r\nto use one of Mr. McKinley's early expressions deprecating doing for\r\nthe Philippines what we did for Cuba. [477]\r\n\r\nBut let us see just how much the Philippine Commission that signed the\r\npeace certificate of March 28, 1907, swallowed, and how they swallowed\r\nit. It will be observed that they sugar-coated their certificate with\r\na lot of whereases. The first of these recites President Roosevelt's\r\npromise of March 28, 1905, that the Filipinos should have a legislature\r\ntwo years thereafter \"provided that a condition of general and\r\ncomplete peace with recognition of the authority of the United States\r\nshould be certified by the Philippine Commission to have continued in\r\nthe territory of the Philippine Islands for a period of two years\"\r\nafter the proclamation. Whereas number two, it will be noted, goes\r\non to state that there have been \"no serious disturbances of public\r\norder save and except\" those in Cavite, Batangas, Samar, and Leyte,\r\n[478] the magnitude of which has been fully described in previous\r\nchapters. Of the Cavite-Batangas insurrection, the only one they had\r\npreviously formally admitted to be an insurrection, they say it was\r\n\"caused by certain noted outlaws and bandit chieftains [naming them],\r\nand their followers.\" Obviously this was hardly sufficient to show\r\nthat an insurrection they had once officially recognized as such\r\nwas not in fact such at all. So in order to justify a statement\r\nthat \"a condition of general and complete peace\" had continued in\r\nthese two great provinces of Cavite and Batangas, which they had\r\nbut shortly previously declared to be in a state of insurrection,\r\nand been upheld by the Supreme Court in so doing, they resort to the\r\nold Otis expedient of 1898-9, worked on the American people through\r\nMr. McKinley to show absence of lack of consent-of-the-governed. This\r\nexpedient, as we have seen in the earlier chapters of this book,\r\nconsisted in vague use of the word \"majority.\" It had stood Judge\r\nTaft in good stead in the campaign of 1900, because when he then\r\nsaid that \"the great majority of the people\" were \"entirely willing\"\r\nto accept American rule, there was no earthly way to disprove it\r\nin time for the verdict of the American people to be influenced by\r\nthe unanimity of the Filipinos against a change of masters in lieu\r\nof independence. It was the only possible expedient for an American\r\nconscience, because every American naturally feels that unless he\r\ncan, by some sort of sophistry, persuade himself that \"the majority\"\r\nof the people want a given thing, then the thing is a wrong thing to\r\nforce upon them. So the ethical hurdle the Commission had to leap in\r\norder to sign the certificate of 1907 was cleared thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The overwhelming majority of the people of said provinces have\r\n    not taken part in said disturbances and have not aided and abetted\r\n    the lawless acts of said bandits.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the report of the American Governor of Cavite--and\r\nconditions were conceded to be identical in the two provinces of\r\nCavite and Batangas--shows that the reason it was so hard to suppress\r\nthe Cavite-Batangas troubles of 1905 was that the people would not\r\nhelp the authorities to apprehend the outlaws. No doubt the King of\r\nEngland would have signed a similar certificate as to the people of\r\nthe shires and counties in which Robin Hood, Little John, and Friar\r\nTuck, held high carnival. Of course I do not mean to libel the fair\r\nfame of that fine freebooter Robin Hood and his companions by placing\r\nthe rascally leaders of the bands of outlaws now under consideration\r\nin the same jolly and respectable class with those beloved friends of\r\nthe childhood of us all. But the Cavite-Batangas \"patriots\" of 1905\r\ncould never have given the authorities as much trouble as they did if\r\nthe people had not at least taken secret joy in discomfiture of the\r\nAmerican authorities. Until finally suppressed, all such movements\r\nas these always grew exactly as a snow-ball does if you roll it on\r\nsnow. Says Governor Shanks, a Major of the 4th United States Infantry,\r\nwho was Governor of Cavite, in 1905 in his report for that year, [479]\r\nin explaining the uprising under consideration, and the way it grew:\r\n\"The Filipino likes to be on the winning side.\" Certainly this is\r\nnot peculiar to the Filipino. Governor Shanks proceeds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The prestige acquired (by the uprising) at San Pedro Tunasan,\r\n    Paranaque, Taal, and San Francisco de Malabon had great weight in\r\n    creating active sympathy for ladrone bands and leaders. Something\r\n    was needed to counterbalance the effect of their combined\r\n    successes, and the appearance of regular troops was just the\r\n    thing needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis explains how \"the overwhelming majority\" of which the certificate\r\nof 1907 speaks was obtained in Cavite. It took six months to obtain\r\nsaid \"majority\" at that. I suppose the campaigning of the American\r\nregulars might be credited with obtaining the \"majority,\" and the\r\nreconcentration of brother Baker of the constabulary might be accorded\r\nthe additional credit of making the majority \"overwhelming.\" If you\r\nhave, as election tellers, so to speak, a soldier with a bayonet on\r\none side, and a constabulary officer with a reconcentration camp\r\nback of him on the other, you can get an \"overwhelming majority\"\r\nfor the continuance of American rule even in Cavite province.\r\n\r\nThrough men I commanded during the early campaigning, I have killed my\r\nshare of Filipinos in the time of war; and after the civil government\r\nwas set up I had occasion to hang a good many of them, under what\r\nseemed to me a necessary application of the old Mosaic law, \"An eye\r\nfor an eye, a tooth for a tooth, and a life for a life.\" But I thank\r\nGod I have never been a party to the insufferable pretence that they,\r\nor any appreciable fraction of them, ever consented to our rule. This,\r\nhowever, is the whole theory of the Philippine Commission's certificate\r\nof March 28, 1907. It is curious how generously and supremely frank a\r\nbrave soldier will get when he forgets to be a politician. In one of\r\nhis state papers of 1907 Governor-General Smith [480] speaks of General\r\nTrias, who had been Lieutenant-General of the insurgent army in the\r\ndays of the insurrection, and next in rank to Aguinaldo himself, as one\r\n\"whose love of country had been tested on many a well fought field\r\nof honorable conflict.\" Contrast this tribute to the respectability\r\nof the original Philippine war for independence against us with the\r\nlong list of stale falsehoods already reviewed in this volume, on the\r\nfaith of which, in the presidential campaign of 1900, the American\r\npeople were persuaded that to deny to the Filipinos what they had\r\naccorded to Cuba was righteous! The leaders of the Cavite-Batangas\r\nuprising of 1905 had been officers of the insurgent army, and that\r\nwas the secret of their hold upon the people of those provinces. It\r\nis true that they must have been pretty sorry officers, and that they\r\nwere ladrones (brigands). They were cruel and unmitigated scoundrels\r\nworking for purely selfish and vainglorious ends. But it was the\r\ncloak of patriotism, however, infamously misused, that gained them\r\nsuch success as they attained in 1905. Says the American Governor of\r\nCavite province in his annual report for 1906 [481]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The province should be most carefully watched. I am convinced\r\n    that ladrone leaders do not produce conditions, but that the\r\n    conditions and attitude of the public produce ladrones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo much for the Cavite-Batangas hurdle. And now as to the Samar and\r\nLeyte hurdle.\r\n\r\nThe signers of the certificate of 1907 justify their certificate as to\r\nSamar and Leyte on a very ingenious theory. The Act of Congress of July\r\n1, 1902, already cited, which had provided for the taking of a census\r\npreliminary to the call of an election for delegates to a legislature,\r\nhad recognized the crude ethnological status of the Moros and other\r\nnon-Christian tribes. These had never had anything whatever to do\r\nwith the insurrection against us. Therefore in making the continuance\r\nof a state of general and complete peace for a prescribed period a\r\ncondition precedent to granting the Filipinos a legislature, the Act\r\nof 1902 had limited that condition precedent to \"the territory of said\r\nIslands not inhabited by Moros or other non-Christian tribes.\" In fact\r\nPresident Roosevelt's proclamation of September 25, 1902, already\r\nnoticed, ordering the taking of the census on the theory that a\r\nstate of general and complete peace then existed, explains that this\r\ntheory is entirely consistent with trouble among the Moros and other\r\nnon-Christian tribes because they, it says, quoting from a statement\r\nof the Philippine Commission previously made to the President,\r\n\"never have taken any part in the insurrection.\" The Moros and other\r\nnon-Christian tribes were, so to speak, in no sense assets of the\r\nPhilippine insurrection. All the rest of the population was--that is,\r\nif there was anything in the veteran General MacArthur's grim jest of\r\n1900, prompted by Governor Taft's half-baked opinion to the contrary,\r\nthat \"ethnological homogeneity\" was the secret of the unanimity of the\r\nopposition we met, and that somehow people \"will stick to their own\r\nkith and kin.\" When the Philippine Government Act of 1902 was drawn\r\nnobody pretended for a moment that there were any non-Christian tribes\r\neither in Samar or Leyte. The whole population of those Islands were\r\nvaluable assets of the insurrection. If any one doubts it, let him\r\nask the 9th Infantry. You will find in the Census of 1903 that there\r\nare no non-Christian tribes credited either to Samar or Leyte. [482]\r\nWhen the Philippine Government Act of 1902 was drafted, the exception\r\nabout Moros and other non-Christian tribes was intended to except\r\nmerely certain types of people as distinct from the great mass of the\r\nPhilippine population as islands are from the sea. The fact is, no\r\nperson connected with the Philippine Government either before or after\r\nthe certificate under consideration, ever thought of classifying the\r\nignorant country people of the uplands and hills of Samar or Leyte,\r\nas \"non-Christian tribes.\" The Philippine Census of 1903 does not\r\nso classify them. The very volume of the Report of the Philippine\r\nCommission for 1907 in which the certificate aforesaid appears,\r\ndoes not. In that volume, [483] the report of the Executive Secretary\r\ndeals elaborately with the subject of non-Christian tribes. Professor\r\nWorcester of the Philippine Commission has for the last twelve years\r\nbeen the grand official digger-up of non-Christian tribes. He takes\r\nas much delight at the discovery of a new non-Christian tribe in\r\nsome remote, newly penetrated mountain fastness, as the butterfly\r\ncatcher with the proverbial blue goggles does in the capture of a\r\nnew kind of butterfly. The Executive Secretary's report, out of\r\ndeference to the professor, omits no single achievement of his\r\nwith reference to his anthropological hobby. It treats, with an\r\nenthusiasm that would delight Mrs. Jellyby herself, of \"the progress\r\nthat was made during the fiscal year in the work of civilizing\r\nnon-Christian tribes scattered throughout the archipelago.\" It\r\ngives an alphabetical list of all the provinces where there are\r\nnon-Christian tribes, and, under the name of each province it gives\r\nnotes as to the progress during the year with those tribes. Neither\r\nSamar nor Leyte appear in that list of provinces. So that the Samar\r\n\"Pulajans,\" or \"Red Breeches\" fellows,--\"fanatical\" Pulajans, they\r\nare called in the certificate--were \"non-Christian tribes\" for peace\r\ncertificate purposes only. One thing which makes it most difficult\r\nof all for me to understand how these gentlemen got their consent\r\nto sign that certificate is that each non-Christian tribe in the\r\nPhilippines has a language of its own, whereas the country people\r\nof the uplands and mountains of Samar and Leyte who are labelled--or\r\nlibelled--\"non-Christian tribes\" in the certificate of 1907, were no\r\nmore different from the rest of the population of those islands than,\r\nfor instance, the ignorant mountain people of Virginia or Kentucky\r\nare different, ethnologically, from the inhabitants of Richmond or\r\nLouisville. In his report for 1908, [484] Governor-General Smith\r\nhimself makes this perfectly clear, where he describes the Samar\r\nPulajan, or mountaineer, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Pulajan is not a robber or a thief by nature--quite the\r\n    contrary. He is hard working, industrious, and even frugal. He\r\n    had his little late [485] of hemp on the side of the mountain,\r\n    and breaking out his picul [486] of hemp, he carried it hank by\r\n    hank for miles and miles over almost impassable mountain trails\r\n    to the nearest town or barrio. There he offered it for sale,\r\n    and if he refused the price tendered, which was generally not\r\n    more than half the value, he soon found himself arrested on a\r\n    trumped-up charge, and unless he compromised by parting with his\r\n    hemp he found himself, after paying his fine and lawyer's fees,\r\n    without either hemp or money.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe non-Christian tribes, on the other hand, never have anything to\r\ndo with the civilized people. The Act of Congress of 1902, therefore,\r\nhad no sort of reference to the simple, ignorant, and ordinarily\r\ndocile mountain folk who tilled the soil, revered the priests, paid\r\ntheir cedula or head tax like all the rest of the population of the\r\nIslands, and carried their agricultural products from season to season,\r\ntheir hemp and the like, to the coast towns to market. In other words,\r\ninclusion of the Samar \"Pulajans,\" or \"Red Breeches\" brigade, and the\r\nLeyte bandits, in the peace certificate of 1907, as \"non-Christian\r\ntribes\" was an afterthought, having no foundation either in logic\r\nor fact. It was a part of Benevolent Assimilation. This is clearly\r\napparent from President Roosevelt's message to Congress of December,\r\n1905. [487] You do not find any buncombe about \"non-Christian\r\ntribes\" in that message. In there reviewing the Samar and other\r\ninsurrections of 1905 in the Philippines, you find him dealing with\r\nthe real root of the evil with perfect honesty, though adopting the\r\nview that the Filipino people were to blame therefor, because we\r\nhad placed too much power in the hands of an ignorant electorate,\r\nwhich had elected rascally officials. \"Cavite and Samar,\" he says,\r\n\"are instances of reposing too much confidence in the self-governing\r\npower of a people.\" If we had let the Filipinos go ahead with their\r\nlittle republic in 1898, instead of destroying it as we did, they\r\nknew and would have utilized the true elements of strength they had,\r\nviz., a very considerable body of educated, patriotic men having\r\nthe loyal confidence of the masses of the people. But we proceeded\r\nto ram down their throats a preconceived theory that the only road\r\nto self-government was for an alien people to step in and make the\r\nignorant masses the sine qua non. Yet if there was one point on which\r\nMr. McKinley had laid more stress than on any other, in his original\r\ninstructions of April 7, 1900, to the Taft Commission, that point was\r\nthe one consecrated in the following language of those instructions:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In all the forms of government and administrative provisions which\r\n    they are authorized to prescribe, the commission should bear in\r\n    mind that the government which they are establishing is designed\r\n    not for * * * the expression of our theoretical views, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the ignorant electorate we perpetrated on Samar as an\r\n\"expression of our theoretical views\" proved that we had \"gone too\r\nfast\" in conferring self-government, or, to quote Mr. Roosevelt,\r\nhad been \"reposing too much confidence in the self-governing power\r\nof a people,\" if to begin with the rankest material for constructing\r\na government that there was at hand was to offer a fair test of\r\ncapacity for self-government. But President Roosevelt's message,\r\nabove quoted, shows you that the \"ignorant electorate\" was merely an\r\nignorant electorate, and not a non-Christian tribe, as the Philippine\r\nCommission later had the temerity to certify they were. Now the plain,\r\nunvarnished, benevolent truth is just this: The Commission knew that\r\nnobody in the United States, whether they were for retaining the\r\nIslands or against retaining them, had any desire to postpone granting\r\na legislature to the Philippine people. So in their certificate they\r\nsimply included everybody who had given trouble in Samar and Leyte\r\nas \"non-Christian tribes.\" The only justification for this was that\r\nthey had in fact acted in a most un-Christianlike manner,--i.e., for\r\npeople who devotedly murmur prayers to patron saints in good standing\r\nin the church calendar. In making their certificate, the Commission\r\nsimply ignored the various uprisings of the preceding two years. They\r\nsimply said, generously, \"Oh, forget it.\" They knew nobody in the\r\nUnited States begrudged the Filipinos their conditionally promised\r\nlegislature, or cared to postpone it. The leading Filipinos begged the\r\nauthorities to \"forget\" the various disturbances that had occurred\r\nsince the publication of the census, and there was a very general\r\ndesire in the Islands to let bygones be bygones, wipe the slate, and\r\nbegin again. Any other attitude would have meant that the legislature\r\nwould have to be postponed. Then the opposition in the United States\r\nwould want to know why, and by 1908 Philippine independence might\r\nbecome an issue again. In the eyes of the Commission, the end, being\r\nbenevolent, justified stretching the language of the Act of 1902\r\nas if it had been the blessed veil of charity itself--i.e., the end\r\njustified the means. In fact it did--almost--justify the means. But not\r\nquite. The moral quality of the Great Certificate of 1907 was not as\r\nreprehensible as General Anderson's dealings with Aguinaldo, already\r\ndescribed, which, like the certificate, were a necessary part of the\r\nbenevolent hypocrisy of Benevolent Assimilation of an unconsenting\r\npeople. Yet General Anderson is an honorable man. It was not as bad\r\nas General Greene's juggling Aguinaldo out of his trenches before\r\nManila in a friendly way, and failing to give him a receipt for said\r\ntrenches, as he had promised to do, because such a receipt would show\r\nco-operation and \"might look too much like an alliance.\" This also was\r\ndone on the idea that the end justified the means. Yet General Greene\r\nis an honorable man. The signers of the great peace certificate of\r\n1907 are all honorable men. But they signed that certificate, just the\r\nsame. \"Judge not that ye be not judged.\" All I have to say is, I would\r\nnot have signed that certificate. I would have said: \"No, gentlemen,\r\nthe end does not justify the means. The Philippine Assembly must be\r\npostponed, if we are going to deal frankly with Congress and the folks\r\nat home. The conditions Congress made precedent to the grant of an\r\nassembly have not been met, and we each and all of us know it. We owe\r\nmore to our own country and to truth than we do to the Filipinos. The\r\nAct of Congress of 1902 did not vest in the Philippine Commission\r\nauthority to pardon disturbances of public order. It imposed upon\r\nthe Commission an implied duty to report such disturbances, fully\r\nand frankly. It is not true that there has been a continuing state of\r\ngeneral and complete peace in these Islands for the last two years,\r\nand I for one will not certify that there has been.\"\r\n\r\nThe truth is, the attitude of the signers of the certificate was like\r\nthat of Uncle Remus, when interrupted by the little boy in one of his\r\nstories. When Uncle Remus gets to the point in the rabbit story where\r\nthe rabbit thrillingly escapes from the jaws of death, i.e., from the\r\njaws of the dogs, by climbing a tree, the rapt listener interrupts:\r\n\"Why, Uncle Remus, a rabbit can't climb a tree.\" To which Uncle\r\nRemus replies, with a reassuring wave of the hand, \"Oh, but Honey,\r\ndis rabbit dess 'bleeged ter climb dis tree.\"\r\n\r\nShould any of my good friends still in the Philippines feel disposed to\r\ncensure such levity as the above, I can only say, as Kipling writes\r\nfrom England to his Anglo-Indian friends in a foreword to one of\r\nhis books:\r\n\r\n\r\n            I have told these tales of our life\r\n              For a sheltered people's mirth,\r\n            In jesting guise,--but ye are wise,\r\n              And ye know what the jest is worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, my authority to speak frankly about these matters is also\r\naptly stated by the same great poet thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n            I have eaten your bread and salt,\r\n              I have drunk your water and wine,\r\n            The deaths ye died I have watched beside\r\n              And the lives that ye led were mine.\r\n\r\n            Was there aught that I did not share\r\n              In vigil or toil or ease,\r\n            One joy or woe that I did not know,\r\n              Dear friends across the seas?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above reflections are not placed before the reader to show him\r\nwhat a pity it is that the writer was not a member of the Philippine\r\nCommission at the time of their certificate of 1907, or to show what\r\na fine thing for our common country it would be if he were made a\r\nmember of that Commission now. He is, personally, as disinterested\r\nas if Manila were in the moon, for he cannot live in the tropics\r\nany more. The effect of a year or so of residence there upon white\r\nmen invalided home for tropical dysentery and then returning to the\r\nIslands is like the effect of water upon a starched shirt. However,\r\nit is believed that the facts of official record collected in this\r\nchapter up to this point are a demonstration of this proposition,\r\nto wit: What the Philippine Government needs more than anything else\r\nis that the minority party in the United States should be represented\r\non the Commission. By this I do not mean representation by what are\r\ncalled, under Republican Administrations, \"White House\" Democrats,\r\nnor what under a Democratic Administration, if one should ever occur,\r\nwould probably be called \"Copperhead Republicans.\" I mean the genuine\r\narticle. A Democrat who has cast his fortunes with the Philippines\r\nis no longer a Democrat relatively to the Philippines, because the\r\nDemocratic party wants to get rid of the Philippines and the Democrat\r\nin the Philippines of course does not. How absurd it is to talk about\r\nformer Governors Wright and Smith, as \"life-long Democrats,\" by way\r\nof preliminary to using their opinions as \"admissions.\" In the law\r\nof evidence, an \"admission\" is a statement made against the interest\r\nof the party making it.\r\n\r\nThe first election for representatives in the Philippine Assembly was\r\nheld on July 30, 1907, and on October 16th thereafter the Assembly\r\nwas formally opened by Secretary of War, William H. Taft. The various\r\n\"whereases\" hereinabove reviewed, importing complete acquiescence in\r\nAmerican rule since President Roosevelt's Proclamation of July 4, 1902,\r\nwere first duly read, and then the Assembly was opened. Of course,\r\nno man could have been elected to the Assembly without at least\r\npretending to be in favor of independence, and all but a corporal's\r\nguard of them were outspoken in favor of the proposition. As the\r\npresent Governor-General Mr. Forbes, said, while Vice-Governor,\r\nin the Atlantic Monthly for February, 1909:\r\n\r\n\r\n    To deny the capacity of one's country for * * * self-government\r\n    is essentially unpopular.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he visited the Philippines to open their Assembly in 1907,\r\nMr. Taft had said nothing definite and final on the question of\r\npromising independence since his departure from the Islands in\r\n1903. His then benevolent unwillingness to tell them frankly he did not\r\nthink they had sense enough to run a government of their own, and that\r\nthey were unfit for self-government, has already been reviewed. For\r\ntwo years after 1903 Governor Wright had made them pine for the return\r\nof Mr. Taft. They longed to hear again some of the siren notes of\r\nthe celebrated speech \"the Philippines for the Filipinos.\" They had\r\ngotten very excited and very happy over that speech. Of course they\r\nwould not have gotten very excited over independence supposed to be\r\ncoming long after they should be dead and buried. During the two dark\r\nfrank years of Governor Wright's regime, they had frequently been\r\ntold that they were not fit for independence. So that when Secretary\r\nof War Taft had visited the Islands in 1905 they all had been on the\r\nqui vive for more statements vaguely implying an independence they\r\nmight hope to live to see. During the visit of 1905 the time of the\r\nvisiting Congressional party was consumed principally with tariff\r\nhearings, and comparatively little was said on the subject uppermost\r\nin the minds of all Filipinos. It is true that Mr. Taft said then he\r\nwas of the opinion that it would take a generation or longer to get\r\nthe country ready for self-government, but he said it in a tactful,\r\nkindly way, and did not forever crush their hopes. So when he went\r\nout to the Islands to open the assembly in 1907, the attitude of the\r\nwhole people in expectation of some definite utterances on the question\r\nof a definite promise of independence at some future time, was just\r\nthe attitude of an audience in a theatre as to which one affirms\r\n\"you could hear a pin fall.\" In this regard Mr. Taft's utterances\r\nwere as follows [488]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I am aware that in view of the issues discussed at the election of\r\n    this assembly I am expected to say something regarding the policy\r\n    of the United States toward these islands. I cannot speak with\r\n    the authority of one who may control that policy. The Philippine\r\n    Islands are territory belonging to the United States, and by the\r\n    Constitution, the branch of that government vested with the power\r\n    and charged with the duty of making rules and regulations for their\r\n    government is Congress. The policy to be pursued with respect\r\n    to them is therefore ultimately for Congress to determine. * * *\r\n    I have no authority to speak for Congress in respect to the\r\n    ultimate disposition of the Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter that there was some talk about \"mutually beneficial trade\r\nrelations\" and \"improvement of the people both industrially and in\r\nself-governing capacity.\" But with regard to the \"process of political\r\npreparation of the Filipino people\" for self-government the Secretary\r\nsaid that was a question no one could certainly answer; and so far as\r\nhe was concerned he thought it would take \"considerable longer than a\r\ngeneration.\" Somewhere in the early Philippine State papers there is\r\na quotation used by Mr. Taft from Shakespeare about \"Keeping the word\r\nof promise to the ear and breaking it to the hope.\" The Filipinos have\r\neagerly read for the last twelve years every utterance of Mr. Taft's\r\nthat they could get hold of. If any of those embryonic statesmen of the\r\nfirst Philippine Assembly, familiar with the various Taft utterances,\r\nhad looked up the context of the Shakespearian quotation above alluded\r\nto, he would have found it to be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n            And be these juggling fiends no more believ'd,\r\n            That palter with us in a double sense:\r\n            That keep the word of promise to our ear\r\n            And break it to our hope. [489]\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the announcement by Secretary of War Taft at the opening\r\nof the Philippine Assembly in October, 1907, of the policy of\r\nindefinite retention of the Islands with undeclared intention,\r\nthe Filipinos have of course clearly understood that if they were\r\never to have independence they must look to Congress for it. But\r\nthey know Congress is not interested in them and that they have no\r\ninfluence with it, and that the Hemp Trust, the Tobacco Trust, and the\r\nSugar Trust, have. So that since 1907, both the American authorities\r\nin the Philippines and the Filipinos have settled down, the former\r\nsuffused with benevolence--hardened however by paternalistic firmness,\r\nthe latter stoically, to the programme of indefinite retention with\r\nundeclared intention. No conceivable programme could be devised more\r\ningeniously calculated to engender race hatred. The Filipino newspapers\r\ncall the present policy one of \"permanent administration for inferior\r\nand incapable races.\" The Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, known as the\r\nPhilippine Government Act, which is the \"Constitution,\" so to speak,\r\nwe have given the Filipinos, accords \"liberty of the press\" in the\r\nexact language of our own Constitution. The native press does not\r\nfail to use this liberty to the limit. Naturally the American press\r\ndoes not remain silent. So here are a pair of bellows ever fanning\r\nthe charcoals of discontent. And the masses of the Filipino people\r\nread the Filipino papers. If they cannot read, their children can. In\r\none of the reports of one of the American constabulary officials in\r\nthe Philippines, there is an account of the influence of the native\r\npress too graphic to be otherwise than accurate. He says one can often\r\nsee, in the country districts, a group of natives gathered about some\r\nvillage Hampden, listening to his reading the latest diatribe against\r\nthe American Occupation. Never was there such folly in the annals of\r\nstatesmanship. In their native papers, the race situation of course\r\ncomes in for much comment. Now the most notorious and inflexible\r\nfact of that race situation is that the colonial Anglo-Saxon does\r\nnot intermarry with \"the yellow and brown\" subject people, as the\r\nLatin colonizing races do. It would be an over-statement of the case\r\nto say that the Filipinos to-day had rather have the Spaniards back\r\nas their overlords instead of us. In 1898, they \"tasted the sweets\r\nof liberty,\" to use an expression of one of their leaders, and I\r\nam perfectly sure that to-day the desire of all those people for a\r\ngovernment of their own is so genuine and universal as that it amounts\r\nto a very hopeful positive factor in the equation of their capacity for\r\nself-government. But there is no doubt that many of the Filipinos after\r\nall have a very warm place in their hearts for the Spanish people. How\r\ncould it be otherwise when so many of the Filipinos are sons and\r\ngrandsons of Spaniards? Much of like and dislike in life's journey is\r\ndetermined pre-natally. On the other hand, the American women in the\r\nPhilippines maintain an attitude toward the natives quite like that of\r\ntheir British sisters in Hong Kong toward the Chinese, and in Calcutta\r\ntoward the natives there. The social status of an American woman who\r\nmarries a native,--I myself have never heard of but one case--is like\r\nthat of a Pacific coast girl who marries a Jap. This is merely the\r\ninstinct of self-defence with which Nature provides the weaker sex,\r\njust as she provides the porcupine with quills. But look at the other\r\nside of the picture. When an American man marries a native woman,\r\nhe thereafter finds himself more in touch with his native \"in-laws\"\r\nit is true, but correspondingly, and ever increasingly, out of touch\r\nwith his former associations. This is not as it should be. But it is\r\na most unpleasant and inexorable fact of the present situation. In\r\nan address delivered at the Quill Club in Manila on January 25,\r\n1909, Governor Smith, after reciting the various beneficent designs\r\ncontemplated by the government and the various public works consummated\r\n(at the expense of the people of the Islands) deplored, in spite of\r\nit all, what he termed \"the growing gulf between the races.\" Said he:\r\n\r\n\r\n    An era of ill feeling has started between Americans and Filipinos,\r\n    and, I hesitate to say it, race hatred.\r\n\r\n\r\nCherchez la femme! You find her, on the one hand, in the American woman\r\nwhose attitude has been indicated, and you find her, on the other,\r\nin the refined and virtuous native woman, who finds her American\r\nhusband's relations to his compatriots altered--queered--since his\r\nmarriage to her, no matter how faithful a wife and mother she may\r\nbe. This is the unspeakably cruel situation we have forced upon the\r\nFilipino people--whom I really learned to respect, and became much\r\nattached to, before I left the Islands--and President Taft knows it\r\nas well as I do. Yet he does not take the American people into his\r\nconfidence. He simply worries along with the situation, wishing it\r\nwould get better, but knowing it will get worse. That this situation\r\nis a permanent one is clearly shown by all the previous teachings\r\nof racial history. In his Winning of the West, written in 1889,\r\nspeaking of the French settlers in the Ohio valley before 1776,\r\nand the cordial social relations of the dominant race with the\r\nnatives--relations which have always obtained with all Latin races\r\nunder like circumstances--Mr. Roosevelt says (vol. i., page 41):\r\n\r\n\r\n    They were not trammelled by the queer pride which makes a man\r\n    of English stock unwilling to make a red-skinned woman his wife,\r\n    though anxious enough to make her his concubine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMen of English stock have changed but little in the matter of race\r\ninstinct since 1776. If we had a definite policy, declared by Congress,\r\npromising independence, the American attitude in the Philippines toward\r\nthe Filipinos would at once change, from the present impossible one,\r\nto our ordinary natural attitude of courtesy toward all foreigners,\r\nregardless of their color.\r\n\r\nOn May 7, 1909, the Honorable James F. Smith took his departure from\r\nthe Philippine Islands forever and turned over the duties of his\r\noffice to the Honorable W. Cameron Forbes, as Acting President of the\r\nCommission and Governor-General. As in the case of Governors Wright\r\nand Ide, so in that of Governor Smith, no reason is apparent why the\r\nWashington Government should have been willing to dispense with the\r\nservices of the incumbent. This was peculiarly true in the case of\r\nGeneral Smith. He was but fifty years of age when he left the Islands\r\nin 1909. He has rendered more different kinds of distinguished public\r\nservice than any American who has ever been in the Philippine Islands\r\nfrom the time Dewey's guns first thundered out over Manila Bay down to\r\nthis good hour. Going out with the first expedition in 1898 as Colonel\r\nof the 1st California Regiment, he distinguished himself on more\r\nthan one battlefield in the early fighting and in recognition thereof\r\nwas made a brigadier-general. Subsequent to this he became Military\r\nGovernor of the island of Negros, that one of the six principal\r\nVisayan Islands which gave less trouble during the insurrection and\r\nafter than any other--a circumstance doubtless not wholly unrelated\r\nto General Smith's wise and tactful administration there. Later on\r\nduring the military regime he became Collector of Customs of the\r\narchipelago. The revenues from customs are the principal source of\r\nrevenue of the Philippine Government and the sums of money handled\r\nare enormous. The customs service, moreover, in most countries, and\r\nespecially in the Philippines, is more subject to the creeping in of\r\ngraft than any other. General Smith's administration of this post was\r\nin keeping with everything else he did in the Islands. When the civil\r\ngovernment was founded by Judge Taft in 1901, he was appointed one of\r\nthe Justices of the Supreme Court and filled the duties of that office\r\nmost creditably. Thence he was promoted to the Philippine Commission,\r\nwhich is, virtually, the cabinet of the Governor-General. Still later\r\nhe became Vice-Governor, and finally Governor, serving as such from\r\nSeptember, 1906, to May, 1909. Any other government on earth that has\r\nover-seas colonies and recognizes the supreme importance of a maximum\r\nof continuity of policy, would have kept Governor Smith as long\r\nas it could have possibly induced him to stay, just as the British\r\nkept Lord Cromer in Egypt. Governor Smith was succeeded by a young\r\nman from Boston, who had come out to the Islands four years before,\r\nand who, prior to that time, had never had any public service in the\r\nUnited States of any kind, had never been in the Philippine Islands,\r\nand probably had never seen a Filipino until he landed at Manila.\r\n\r\nGeneral Smith is now (1912) one of the Judges of the Court of Customs\r\nAppeals at Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR FORBES--1909-1912\r\n\r\n            The trouble with this country to-day is that,\r\n            under long domination by the protected interests,\r\n            a partnership has grown up between them and the\r\n            Government which the best men in the Republican\r\n            party could not break up if they would.--Woodrow Wilson.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Governor Forbes assumed the duties of Governor-General of the\r\nPhilippines, some ten years after the ratification of the Treaty\r\nof Paris whereby we bought the Islands, he was the ninth supreme\r\nrepresentative of American authority we had had there since the\r\nAmerican occupation began. The following is the list:\r\n\r\n\r\n    (1) Gen. Thomas M. Anderson       June  30, 1898-July 25, 1898\r\n    (2) Gen. Wesley Merritt           July  25, 1898-Aug. 29, 1898\r\n    (3) Gen. Elwell S. Otis           Aug.  29, 1898-May 5, 1900\r\n    (4) Gen. Arthur MacArthur         May    5, 1900-July 4, 1901\r\n    (5) Hon. William H. Taft          July   4, 1901-Dec. 23, 1903\r\n    (6) Hon. Luke E. Wright           Dec.  23, 1903-Nov. 4, 1905\r\n    (7) Hon. Henry C. Ide             Nov.   4, 1905-Sept. 20, 1906\r\n    (8) Hon. James F. Smith           Sept. 20, 1906-May 7, 1909\r\n    (9) Hon. W. Cameron Forbes        May    7, 1909- [490]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one of these distinguished gentlemen has ever had any authority to\r\ntell the Filipinos what we expect ultimately to do with them. They\r\nhave not known themselves. Is not this distinctly unfair both to\r\ngovernors and governed?\r\n\r\nBefore Governor Forbes went to the Philippines he had been a largely\r\nsuccessful business man. He is a man of the very highest personal\r\ncharacter, and an indefatigable worker. He has done as well as the\r\nconditions of the problem permit. But he is always between Scylla\r\nand Charybdis. American capital in or contemplating investment in the\r\nIslands is continually pressing to be permitted to go ahead and develop\r\nthe resources of the Islands. To keep the Islands from being exploited\r\nCongress early limited grants of land to a maximum too small to attract\r\ncapital. So those who desire to build up the country, knowing they\r\ncannot get the law changed, are forever seeking to invent ways to get\r\naround the law. And, being firm in the orthodox Administration belief\r\nthat discussion of ultimate independence is purely academic, i.e.,\r\na matter of no concern to anybody now living, Governor Forbes is of\r\ncourse in sympathy with Americans who wish to develop the resources of\r\nthe Islands. On the other hand, he knows that such a course will daily\r\nand hourly make ultimate independence more certain never to come. So\r\ndo the Filipinos know this. Therefore they clamor ever louder and\r\nlouder against all American attempts to repeal the anti-exploiting\r\nActs of Congress by \"liberal\" interpretation. Many an American just\r\nhere is sure to ask himself, \"Why all this 'clamor'? Do we not give\r\nthem good government? What just ground have they for complaint?\" Yes,\r\nwe do give them very good government, so far as the Manila end of\r\nthe business is concerned, except that it is a far more expensive\r\ngovernment than any people on the earth would be willing to impose\r\non themselves. But their main staples are hemp, sugar, and tobacco,\r\nand we raise the last two in this country. Their sugar and tobacco\r\nwere allowed free entry into the United States by the Paine Law of\r\n1909 up to amounts limited in the law, but the Philippine people know\r\nvery well that American sugar and tobacco interests will either dwarf\r\nthe growth of their sugar and tobacco industries by refusing to allow\r\nthe limit raised--the limit of amounts admitted free of duty--or else\r\nthat our Sugar Trust and our Tobacco Trust will simply ultimately\r\neliminate them by absorption, just as the Standard Oil Company used\r\nto do with small competitors. In this sort of prospect certainly even\r\nthe dullest intellect must recognize just ground for fearing--nay for\r\nplainly foreseeing--practical industrial slavery through control by\r\nforeign [491] corporations of economic conditions. So much for the\r\ntwo staples in which the Philippines may some day become competitors\r\nof ours. It took Mr. Taft nine years to persuade American sugar and\r\ntobacco that they would not be in any immediate danger by letting\r\nin a little Philippine sugar and tobacco free of duty. Then they\r\nconsented. Not until then did they promise not to shout \"Down with\r\ncheap Asiatic labor. We will not consent to compete with it.\" Their\r\nmental reservation was, of course, and is, \"if the Philippine sugar\r\nand tobacco industries get too prosperous, we will either buy them,\r\nor cripple them by defeating their next attempt to get legislation\r\nincreasing the amounts of Philippine sugar and tobacco admitted into\r\nthe United States free of duty.\" And the Filipinos know that this is\r\nthe fate that awaits two out of the three main sources of the wealth\r\nof their country. Their third source of wealth, their main staple, is\r\nthe world-famous Manila hemp. This represents more than half the value\r\nof their total annual exports. And as to it, \"practical industrial\r\nslavery through control by foreign corporations of economic conditions\"\r\nis to-day not a fear, but a fact. The International Harvester Company\r\nhas its agents at Manila. The said company or allied interests,\r\nor both, are large importers of Manila hemp. The reports of all the\r\ngovernors-general of the Philippines who have preceded Governor Forbes\r\ntell, year after year, of the millions \"handed over\" to American hemp\r\nimporters through \"the hemp joker\" of the Act of Congress of 1902,\r\nhereinafter explained, in the chapter on Congressional Legislation\r\n(Chapter XXVI.). Why did these complaints--made with annual\r\nregularity up to Governor Forbes's accession--cease thereafter? You\r\nwill find these complaints of his predecessors transcribed in the\r\nchapter mentioned, because if I had re-stated them you might suspect\r\nexaggeration. The \"rake-off\" of the American importers of Manila hemp\r\nfor 1910 was nearly $750,000, as fully explained in Chapter XXVI.\r\n\r\nGovernor Forbes will be in this country when this book is issued. I\r\nthink he owes it to the American people to explain why he does not\r\ncontinue the efforts of his predecessors to halt the depredations\r\nof the Hemp Trust. Why does he content himself in his last annual\r\nreport with a mild allusion to the fact that the condition of\r\nthe hemp industry is \"not satisfactory\"? I have said that Governor\r\nForbes is a man of high character, and take pleasure in repeating that\r\nstatement in this connection. The truth is we are running a political\r\nkindergarten for adults in the Philippines, and those responsible\r\nfor the original blunder of taking them, and all their political\r\nheirs and assigns since, have sought to evade admitting and setting\r\nto work to rectify the blunder. Unmasked, this is what the policy of\r\nBenevolent Assimilation now is. They allege an end, and so justify\r\nall the ways and means. Benevolent Assimilation needs the support\r\nof the International Harvester Company and of all other Big Business\r\ninterested directly or indirectly in Manila hemp. The end justifies\r\nthe means. Hence the silence. Philippine gubernatorial reticence is\r\nalways most reticent about that particular subject on which at the time\r\nthe American people are most peculiarly entitled to information. As\r\nlong as public order was the most pressing question, Philippine\r\ngubernatorial reticence selected that branch of our colonial problem\r\neither for especial silence or for superlatively casual allusion, as\r\nwe have already seen. So now with the economic distresses. Frankness\r\nwould obviously furnish too much good argument for winding up this\r\nOriental receivership of ours. The Philippine Government will never\r\ntell its main current troubles until after they are over. But as\r\nthe present trouble--the economic depredations of powerful special\r\ninterests--must necessarily be fruitful of discontent which will\r\ncrop out some day to remind us that as we sow so shall we reap,\r\nany one who helps expose the root of the trouble is doing a public\r\nservice. No Congressman who in silence would permit Big Business to\r\nprey upon his constituents as Governor Forbes has, could long remain in\r\noffice. Taxation without representation may amount to depredation, and\r\nyet never be corrected, when the powers that prey have the ear of the\r\ncourt, and the victims cannot get the ear of the American people. So\r\nthe Hemp Trust continues to rob the Filipinos under the forms of law,\r\nand the Mohonk Conference continues to kiss Benevolent Assimilation\r\non both cheeks. And Dr. Lyman Abbott periodically says Amen. I am not\r\nspeaking disrespectfully of Dr. Abbott. I am deploring the lack of\r\ninformation of our people at home as to conditions in the Philippines.\r\n\r\nIt is a relief to turn from such matters to some of the real\r\nsubstantial good we have done out there to which Governor Forbes\r\nhas heretofore publicly pointed with just pride. In an article\r\nin the Atlantic Monthly for February, 1909, Governor Forbes (then\r\nVice-Governor) said, among other things:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have completed the separation of Church and State, buying out\r\n    from the religious orders their large agricultural properties,\r\n    which are now administered by the government for the benefit of\r\n    the tenants.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis statement I cannot too cordially endorse. It would be grossly\r\nunfair not to accord full measure of acclaim to Governor Taft for the\r\nway he worked out the problem of the Friar Lands. He has been attacked\r\nin some quarters in this regard, and most unjustly. Not being a\r\nCatholic, and all my people being Protestants, I have no fear of being\r\nsuspected of special pleading in the matter. The working out of the\r\nFriar Land problem by Governor Taft in the Philippines was a splendid\r\npiece of constructive statesmanship. He was at his greatest and best\r\nin that very transaction. The Treaty of Paris had guaranteed that all\r\nvested rights should be respected, including those of ecclesiastical\r\nbodies. The friars had long owned the lands in question. There can be\r\nno particle of doubt on this point. The tenants on the land had all\r\nlong ago attorned to them, father and son, from time out of mind,\r\npaying rent regularly. But by claiming jurisdiction over their\r\ntenants' souls also, and getting that jurisdiction effectively\r\nrecognized, the thrifty friars used to raise the rent regularly,\r\nquieting incipient protest with threats of eternal punishment,\r\nor protracted stay in purgatory. The advent of our government let\r\nloose a revolt against the authority of the friars generally, and,\r\ntheir spiritual hold once loosened, this led the tenants to dispute\r\nthe land titles of their spiritual shepherds, who were also their\r\ntemporal landlords. Of course the titles had all been long recorded,\r\nand looked after by the best legal talent the country afforded. As\r\nlong as you control the future of your tenant's soul, you can make him\r\npay his last copeck for rent. But as soon as that control is lost,\r\nthe man on whom the governing of the country thereafter devolves\r\nhas a certain prospect of a great agrarian revolution on his hands,\r\nhaving in it many elements of substantial righteousness. Governor\r\nTaft's capacious mind, prompted by his strongest instinct, love of\r\njustice, conceived the idea of having the Philippine Government raise\r\nthe money to buy the Friar Lands, by issuing bonds, and then buying\r\nthe Friars out and re-selling the land to the tenants on long time,\r\non the instalment plan, the instalments to be so graduated as to be\r\nequal to a moderate rental. Each tenant stayed right where he had\r\nbeen all the time, in possession of the tract he had always tilled,\r\nhe and his father before him. To arrange all this it took an Act of\r\nCongress authorizing the bond issue, and a visit to Rome to arrange\r\nthe bargain with the Pope. Some say His Holiness drove a hard bargain\r\nwith Governor Taft, or to put it another way, that Governor Taft paid\r\nthe Church people too much for the land. He did not. He may not have\r\ncounted pennies with them, but the lands were worth what he paid for\r\nthem. And the purchase protected the faith and honor of our government,\r\nas pledged by the Treaty of Paris, and at the same time prevented an\r\nagrarian revolution--which would have had a lot of elemental justice\r\non its side.\r\n\r\nAnother of the good works we have done in the Philippines, to which\r\nGovernor Forbes points in his magazine article above mentioned,\r\nis thus noted by him:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have put the finances on a sound and sensible basis.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo this also I say Amen. The Forbes article then goes on to say\r\nthat the government of the Islands is self-supporting. This is\r\ntrue, except the $14,000,000 a year it costs us to keep out there a\r\ngarrison of 12,000 American troops (supplemented by certain native\r\nscouts--see chapter on \"Cost of the Philippines,\" hereafter). This\r\ngarrison is conceded to be a mere handful, sufficient merely,\r\nand intended merely--as a witty English woman has put it in a book\r\non the Philippines--\"to knock the Filipino on the head in case he\r\nwants his liberty before the Americans think he is fit for it.\" In\r\nother words, we only attempt to keep force enough there to quell any\r\noutbreak that might occur. So far as possible invasion by any foreign\r\npower is concerned, our $14,000,000 per annum is an absolutely dead\r\nloss. Brigadier-General Clarence Edwards, U. S. A., commanding the\r\nBureau of Insular Affairs, said recently [492] before the Finance\r\nCommittee of the Senate:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I would never think of the Philippines as a military problem for\r\n    defence. If any nation wants them, it is merely a declaration\r\n    of war.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a shameful admission for a great nation to subscribe to,\r\nrelatively to people it pretends to be protecting! The programme of\r\nthe War Department is to abandon the Islands to their fate, for the\r\ntime being at least, in our next war, letting them remain a football\r\nuntil the end of such war, when, as an independent republic they\r\ncould, and would, rally as one man to the defence of their country\r\nagainst invasion, and would, with a little help from us, make life\r\nunbearable for an invading force. As things stand, we are just as\r\nimpotent as Spain was out there in 1898, and it is utter folly to\r\nforget what happened then.\r\n\r\nBut to return to Governor Forbes's article and to a pleasanter feature\r\nof the situation. He says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have established schools throughout the archipelago, teaching\r\n    upward of half a million children.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also is true, and greatly to our credit. But as the American\r\nhemp trust mulcts the Philippine hemp output about a half million\r\ndollars a year (as above suggested, and later, in another chapter,\r\nmore fully explained), it follows that each Filipino child pays the\r\nhemp trust a dollar a year for the privilege of going to school.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us consider the most supremely important part of Governor\r\nForbes's magazine article above quoted. The burden of the song of\r\nthe adverse minority report on the pending Jones bill (looking to\r\nPhilippine independence in 1921) [493] is that because there are\r\ncertain \"wild tribes\" scattered throughout the archipelago, in the\r\nmountain fastnesses, therefore we should cling to the present policy of\r\nindefinite retention with undeclared intention until the wild tribes\r\nget civilized. Governor Forbes's article is an absolute, complete,\r\nand final answer to the misinformed nonsense of the minority report\r\naforesaid. He says, apropos of public order:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is now safe to travel everywhere throughout the Islands without\r\n    carrying a weapon, excepting only in some of the remote parts of\r\n    the mountains, where lurk bands of wild tribes who might possibly\r\n    mistake the object of a visit, and in the southern part of the\r\n    great island of Mindanao which is inhabited by intractable Moros.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe foregoing unmasks, in all its contemptible falsehood, the pretence\r\nthat the presence of a few wild tribes in the Philippines is a reason\r\nfor withholding independence from 7,000,000 of Christian people in\r\norder that a greedy little set of American importers of Manila hemp may\r\nfatten thereon. True, hemp is not edible, but it is convertible into\r\nedibles--and also into campaign funds. That the existence of these wild\r\ntribes--the dog-eating Igorrotes and other savages you saw exhibited at\r\nthe St. Louis Exposition of 1903-4--constitute infinitely less reason\r\nfor withholding independence from the Filipinos than the American\r\nIndian constituted in 1776 for withholding independence from us, will\r\nbe sufficiently apparent from a glance at the following table, taken\r\nfrom the American Census of the Islands of 1903 (vol. ii., p. 123):\r\n[494]\r\n\r\n\r\n        Island      Civilized       Wild        Total\r\n\r\n        Luzon       3,575,001    223,506    3,798,507\r\n        Panay         728,713     14,933      743,646\r\n        Cebu          592,247                 592,247\r\n        Bohol         243,148                 243,148\r\n        Negros        439,559     21,217      460,776\r\n        Leyte         357,641                 357,641\r\n        Samar         222,002        688      222,690\r\n        Mindanao      246,694    252,940      499,634\r\n\r\n\r\nI think the above table makes clear the enormity of the injustice I am\r\nnow trying to crucify. Without stopping to use your pencil, you can\r\nsee that Mindanao, the island where the \"intractable Moros\" Governor\r\nForbes speaks of live, contains about a half million people. Half\r\nof these are civilized Christians, and the other half are the wild,\r\ncrudely Mohammedan Moro tribes. Above Mindanao on the above list,\r\nyou behold what practically is the Philippine archipelago (except\r\nMindanao), viz., Luzon and the six main Visayan Islands. If you will\r\nturn back to pages 225 et seq., especially to page 228, where the\r\nstudent of world politics was furnished with all he needs or will\r\never care to know about the geography of the Philippine Islands,\r\nyou will there find all the rocks sticking out of the water and all\r\nthe little daubs you see on the map eliminated from the equation\r\nas wholly unessential to a clear understanding of the problem of\r\ngoverning the Islands. That process of elimination left us Luzon and\r\nthe six main Visayan Islands above, as constituting, for all practical\r\ngovernmental purposes all the Philippine archipelago except the Moro\r\ncountry, Mindanao (i.e., parts of it), and its adjacent islets;\r\nLuzon and the Visayan Islands contain nearly 7,000,000 of people,\r\nand of these the wild tribes, as you can see by a glance at the above\r\ntable, constitute less than 300,000, sprinkled in the pockets of their\r\nvarious mountain regions. Nearly all these 300,000 are quite tame,\r\npeaceable, and tractable, except, as Governor Forbes suggests, they\r\n\"might possibly mistake the object of a visit.\" The half million\r\n\"intractable Moros\" of Mindanao, plus those in the adjacent islets,\r\nmake up another 300,000. These last, it is true, will need policing\r\nfor some time to come, but whether we do that policing by retaining\r\nMindanao, or whether we let the Filipinos do it, is a detail that has\r\nno standing in court as a reason for continuing to deny independence\r\nto the 7,000,000 of people of Luzon and the Visayan Islands because\r\nthey have some 300,000 backward people in the backwoods of their\r\nmountains. Yet see how the ingenuity of inspired ignorance states the\r\ncase, by adding the 300,000 tame tribes of Luzon and the Visayas to\r\nthe 300,000 fierce Moro savages away down in Mindanao, near Borneo,\r\nso as to get 600,000 \"wild\" people, and then alluding to the fact\r\nthat so far only 200,000 Filipinos are qualified to vote. Says the\r\nreport of the minority of the Committee on Insular Affairs on the\r\npending Jones bill (proposing independence in 1921):\r\n\r\n\r\n    The wild and uncivilized inhabitants of the islands outnumber, 3\r\n    to 1, those who would be qualified to vote under the pending bill\r\n    [the Jones bill].\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see the minority report is counting women and children,\r\nwhen it talks about the wild tribes, but not when it talks about\r\nvoters. According to universally accepted general averages, among\r\n7,500,000 people you should find 1,500,000 adult males. No one doubts\r\nthat of these, by 1921, 500,000 will have become qualified voters. No\r\none can deny that any such country having 500,000 qualified voters, the\r\nbulk of whom are good farmers, and the cream of whom are high-minded\r\neducated gentlemen, and all of whom are intensely patriotic, will be in\r\ngood shape for promotion to independence. What wearies me about this\r\nwhole matter is that the minority report above mentioned is permitted\r\nto get off such \"rot,\" and the New York Times, the Army and Navy\r\nJournal, and others, to applaud it, while the Administration sits by,\r\nsilent, and reaps the benefit of such stale, though not intentional,\r\nfalsehoods, without attempting to correct them, so that our people\r\nmay get at the real merits of the question. You see this silence\r\ninures to the benefit of the interests that have cornered the Manila\r\nhemp industry.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1912 for the Republican nomination for the\r\nPresidency, there was much mutual recrimination between Colonel\r\nRoosevelt and Mr. Taft about which of them had been kindest to\r\nthe International Harvester Company. It seems to me it is \"up to\"\r\nGovernor Forbes, who in the Philippines has served under the present\r\nPresident and his predecessor also, to explain why he has abandoned\r\nthe fight, so long waged by previous governors-general, to get what\r\nformer Governor-General James F. Smith calls \"the [hemp] joker\" of\r\nthe Act of Congress of 1902 concerning the Philippines, wiped from\r\nthe statute books of this country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\"NON-CHRISTIAN\" WORCESTER\r\n\r\n            The cry of remote distress is ever faintly heard.\r\n\r\n                          Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1911, the editor of one of the great metropolitan\r\npapers told me that President Taft told him that the Honorable\r\nDean C. Worcester, the Secretary of the Interior of the Philippine\r\nGovernment, was \"the most valuable man we have on the Philippine\r\nCommission.\" Certainly, reproduction of such an indorsement from\r\nso exalted a source shows a wish to be fair, in one who considers\r\nProfessor Worcester the direst calamity that has befallen the\r\nFilipinos since the American occupation, neither war, pestilence,\r\nfamine, reconcentration, nor tariff-wrought poverty excepted. During\r\nall my stay in the Philippines I never did have any official relations\r\nof any sort with the Professor, and only met him, casually, once,\r\nin 1901. The personal impression left from the meeting was distinctly\r\nthat of an overbearing bully of the beggar-on-horseback type. Conscious\r\nof liability to error, and preferring that the reader should judge for\r\nhimself, I give the main circumstances upon which this impression is\r\nbased. Soon after the central insular government was set up, in 1901,\r\nJudge Taft and certain other members of the Philippine Commission,\r\nthe Professor among the number, came into my judicial district to\r\norganize provincial governments. Their coming to each town where they\r\nstopped was telegraphed in advance, and before they reached the town\r\nwhere I then was holding court each one of the American colony of\r\nthe town was designated by common consent to look after a fraction\r\nof the Taft party during their stay. The Professor fell to my lot. I\r\nalways was unlucky. However, their stay was only a few hours. While\r\nthey were there, I had occasion to observe that the Professor spoke\r\nSpanish quite well and so remarked to him. The well-bred reply was:\r\n\"You'll find that I know a great many things you might not think I\r\nknew.\" Whether this was merely \"The insolence of office\" cropping\r\nout in a previously obscure young man suddenly elevated to high\r\nstation, or whether it was an evidence of the Commissioner's idea\r\nof the relation of the Executive Department of a government to its\r\nJudiciary, is a question. [495] At all events I think the incident\r\ngives an insight into the man not irrelevant to what is hereinafter\r\nsubmitted. I have met a number of other Americans since who had\r\nreceived impressions similar to my own. And the Professor's whole\r\nsubsequent course in the Islands corroborates those impressions. I\r\nhave never talked to any American in the Philippines who had a good\r\nword for him. Of course, Power, like Property, will always have\r\nfriends. So that even Professor Worcester may have some friends,\r\namong his fellow-countrymen in those far-away Islands. But it has\r\nalready been made clear in a former chapter how entirely possible it\r\nis for a man occupying high position in the government out there to\r\nbe very generally and cordially disliked by his own countrymen there\r\nand actually not know it. Whether this is true of Professor Worcester,\r\nor not, as a general proposition it is quite possible. One thing is\r\ncertain, namely, that he is very generally and very cordially detested\r\nby the Filipinos. That this detestation is perfectly natural under\r\nthe circumstances, and entirely justifiable, and that it is a cruel\r\ninjustice to those people, as well as a monumental piece of folly,\r\nto keep the Professor saddled upon them, it is now in order to show.\r\n\r\nIn Chapter VI (ante), we made the acquaintance of two young naval\r\nofficers. Paymaster W. B. Wilcox and Naval Cadet L. R. Sargent, who,\r\nin the fall of 1898, while the fate of the Philippines hung in the\r\nbalance at Paris, and peace still reigned in the Islands between us\r\nand the Filipinos, made a trip through the interior of Luzon, covering\r\nsome six hundred miles, and afterwards furnished Admiral Dewey with\r\na written report of their trip, which was later published as a Senate\r\ndocument. Professor Worcester's greatest value to President Taft, and\r\nalso the thing out of which has grown, most unfortunately, what seems\r\nto be a very cordial mutual hatred between him and the Filipinos,\r\nis his activities in the matter of discovering, getting acquainted\r\nwith, classifying, tabulating, enumerating, and otherwise preparing\r\nfor salvation, the various non-Christian tribes. These tribes have\r\nalready been briefly dealt with in Chapter XXI. (ante), apropos of\r\nthat part of the Great Peace Certificate of 1907 which related to the\r\n\"Moros and other non-Christian tribes\"--uncivilized tribes which,\r\nbeing as distinct from the great mass of the Filipino people as\r\nislets from the sea, had had no more to do with the insurrection\r\nagainst us, than the Pawnees, Apaches, and Sioux Indians had to do\r\nwith our Civil War of 1861-5. They were also dealt with, somewhat,\r\nin the chapter preceding this. Long before Professor Worcester was\r\npermanently inflicted upon the Filipino people, one of the young\r\nnaval officers above mentioned, Mr. Sargent, published an article in\r\nthe Outlook for September 2, 1899, [496] based on this trip through\r\nthe interior of Luzon, made by authority of Admiral Dewey the year\r\nbefore. In the course of his article Mr. Sargent says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Some years ago, at an exposition held at Barcelona, Spain,\r\n    a man and woman were exhibited as representative types of the\r\n    inhabitants of Luzon. The man wore a loin cloth, and the woman\r\n    a scanty skirt. It was evident that they belonged to the lowest\r\n    plane of savagery.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think no deeper wound was ever inflicted upon the pride of the\r\n    real Filipino people than that caused by this exhibition, the\r\n    knowledge of which seems to have spread throughout the island. The\r\n    man and woman, while actually natives of Luzon, were captives of\r\n    a wild tribe of Igorrotes of the hills.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Worcester was originally a professor of zoology, or something\r\nof that sort, in a western university. In the early nineties he had\r\nmade a trip to the Philippines, confining himself then mostly to\r\ncreeping things and quadrupeds--lizards, alligators, pythons, unusual\r\nwild beasts, and other forms of animal life of the kind much coveted as\r\nspecimens by museums and universities. In 1899, just after the Spanish\r\nWar, he got out a book on the Philippines, and as an American who had\r\nbeen in the Philippines was then a rara avis, it came to pass that\r\nthe reptile-finder ultimately became a statesman. He was brought,\r\npossibly by conscious worth, to the notice of President McKinley,\r\naccompanied the Schurman Commission to the Islands, in 1899, and\r\nthe Taft Commission in 1900, and finally evolved into his present\r\neminence as Secretary of the Interior and official chief finder of\r\nnon-Christian tribes for the Philippine Government.\r\n\r\nThe best known of the wild tribes in the Philippines are the Igorrotes,\r\nthe dog-eating savages you saw at the St. Louis Exposition in 1903-4,\r\nthe same Mr. Sargent speaks of in his article in the Outlook. Of\r\ncourse it was not a desire to misrepresent the situation, but only the\r\nenthusiasm of a zoologist, anthropologically inclined, and accustomed\r\nto carry a kodak, which started the Professor to photographing the\r\ndog-eating Igorrotes and specimens of other non-Christian tribes\r\nsoon after the Taft Commission reached the Philippines. But you\r\ncannot get far in the earlier reports of the Taft Commission, which\r\nwas supposed to have been sent out to report back on the capacity of\r\nthe Filipinos for self-government, without crossing the trail of the\r\nProfessor's kodak--pictures of naked Igorrotes and the like. This,\r\nhowever innocent, must have been of distinct political value in\r\n1900 and 1904 in causing the heart of the missionary vote in the\r\nUnited States to bleed for those \"sixty different tribes having sixty\r\ndifferent languages\" of which Secretary Root's campaign speeches made\r\nso much. It must also have greatly awakened the philanthropic interest\r\nof exporters of cotton goods to learn of those poor \"savage millions\"\r\nwearing only a loin cloth, when they could be wearing yards of cotton\r\ncloth. By the time the St. Louis Exposition came off, in 1903-4,\r\nit was decided to have the various tribes represented there. So\r\nspecimens were sent of the Igorrote tribe, the Tagalos, the Visayans,\r\nthe Negrito tribe, and various other tribes. The Tagalos, the Visayans,\r\netc., being ordinary Filipinos, did not prove money-makers. But it was\r\ngreat sport to watch the Igorrotes preparing their morning dog. So it\r\nwas the \"non-Christian tribes\" that paid. It was they that were most\r\nadvertised. It was the recollection of them that lingered longest\r\nwith the visitor to the Exposition, and there was always in his mind\r\nthereafter an association of ideas between the Igorrotes and Filipino\r\ncapacity for self-government generally. Many representative Filipinos\r\nvisited the St. Louis Exposition, saw all this, and came home and told\r\nabout it. One very excellent Filipino gentleman, a friend of mine,\r\nwho was Governor of Samar during my administration of the district\r\nwhich included that island, sent me one day in October, 1904, a\r\nsatirical note, enclosing a pamphlet he had just received called\r\nCatalogue of Philippine Views at the St. Louis Exposition. He knew I\r\nwould understand, so he said in the note, that the pamphlet was sent\r\n\"in order that you may learn something of certain tribes still extant\r\nin this country.\" Concerning all this, I can say of my own knowledge\r\nexactly what Naval Cadet Sargent said concerning the lesser like\r\nindignity of the one Igorrote couple exhibited at Barcelona while\r\nthe Filipinos were asking representation in the Spanish Cortes, viz.:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I think no deeper wound was ever inflicted upon the pride of\r\n    the real Filipino people than that caused by this exhibition,\r\n    the knowledge of which seems to have spread throughout the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see our Census of 1903 gave the population of the Philippines\r\nat about 7,600,000 of which 7,000,000 are put down as civilized\r\nChristians; and of the remaining 600,000, about half are the\r\nsavage, or semi-civilized, crudely Mohammedan Moros, in Mindanao,\r\nand the adjacent islets down near Borneo. The other 300,000 or so\r\nuncivilized people scattered throughout the rest of the archipelago,\r\nthe \"non-Christian tribes,\" which dwell in the mountain fastnesses,\r\nremote from \"the madding crowd,\" cut little more figure, if any,\r\nin the general political equation, than the American Indian does\r\nwith us to-day. Take for instance the province of Nueva Vizcaya,\r\nin the heart of north central Luzon. That was one of the provinces\r\nof the First Judicial District I presided over in the Islands. I\r\nthink Nueva Vizcaya is Professor Worcester's \"brag\" province, in the\r\nmatter of non-Christian anthropological specimens, both regarding\r\ntheir number and their variety. Yet while I was there, though we knew\r\nthose people were up in the hills, and that there were a good many\r\nof them, the civilized people all told us that the hill-tribes never\r\nbothered them. And on their advice I have ridden in safety, unarmed,\r\nat night, accompanied only by the court stenographer, over the main\r\nhigh-road running through the central plateau that constitutes the\r\nbulk of Nueva Vizcaya province, said plateau being surrounded by a\r\ngreat amphitheatre of hills, the habitat of the Worcester pets.\r\n\r\nThe non-Christian tribes in the Philippines have been more\r\nwidely advertised in America than anything else connected with\r\nthe Islands. That advertisement has done more harm to the cause\r\nof Philippine independence by depreciating American conceptions\r\nconcerning Filipino capacity for self-government, than anything that\r\ncould be devised even by the cruel ingenuity of studied mendacity. And\r\nProfessor Worcester is the P. T. Barnum of the \"non-Christian tribe\"\r\nindustry. The Filipinos, though unacquainted with the career of\r\nthe famous menagerie proprietor last named, and his famous remark:\r\n\"The American people love to be humbugged,\" understand the malign\r\nand far-reaching influence upon their future destiny of the work\r\nof Professor Worcester, and his services to the present Philippine\r\npolicy of indefinite retention with undeclared intention, through\r\nhumbugging the American people into the belief that the Islands must be\r\nretained until the three hundred thousand or so Negritos, Igorrotes,\r\nand other primitive wild peoples sprinkled throughout the archipelago\r\nare \"reconstructed.\" Is it any wonder that the Filipinos do not love\r\nthe Professor? To keep him saddled upon them as one of their rulers\r\nis as tactful as it would be to send Senator Tillman on a diplomatic\r\nmission to Liberia or Haiti.\r\n\r\nNot long ago the famous magazine publisher Mr. S. S. McClure, who, I\r\nthink, is trying to make his life one of large and genuine usefulness\r\nfor good, said to me that if we gave the Filipinos self-government\r\nwe would shortly have another Haiti or Santo Domingo on our hands. He\r\nmust have seen some of Professor Worcester's pictures of Igorrotes and\r\nNegritos scattered through public documents related to the question\r\nof Filipino capacity for self-government. Mr. McClure has never,\r\nI believe, been in the Islands; and the cruelly unjust impression he\r\nhad innocently received was precisely the impression systematically\r\ndeveloped all these years through the Worcester kodak.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1911, there appeared an article in the Sunset magazine for\r\nthat month entitled \"The Philippines as I Saw them.\" The contributor\r\nof the article is no less a personage than the Honorable James\r\nF. Smith, former Governor-General of the Islands. At the top of the\r\narticle one reads the legend \"Illustrated by Photographs through\r\nthe Courtesy of the Bureau of Insular Affairs.\" If you read this\r\nlegend understandingly, you can, in so doing, hear the click of the\r\nWorcester kodak. General Smith's article is smeared all over with\r\nsuch pictures. One is merrily entitled \"Eighteen Igorrot Fledglings\r\nHatched by the American Bird of Freedom.\" Another is entitled \"Subano\r\nMan and woman, Mindanao.\" Another is a picture of an Ifugao home\r\nin the province of Nueva Vizcaya, hereinabove mentioned. Ifugao is\r\nthe name of one of the wild tribes, one of the results of Professor\r\nWorcester's anthropological excavations of the last few years. In\r\nfront of the Ifugao home stands the master of the house, clothed in a\r\nbreech-clout. Next in the menagerie in the article under consideration\r\nyou find a group of Ifugao children, then a Bagobo of Mindanao, then\r\nsome other specimen with a curious name, in which there is a woman\r\nnaked from the waist up and a man in a loin-cloth. Then follows a\r\npicture of a Tingyan girl from Abra province. And, to cap the climax,\r\namong the last of these pictures you find a Filipino couple pounding\r\nrice. The rice pounders are ordinary Filipinos. The woman is decently\r\ndressed; the man is clothed only from the waist down, having divested\r\nhimself of his upper garment, as is customary in order to work at hard\r\nlabor more comfortably in hot weather. I do not so much blame General\r\nSmith for this libellous panorama of pictures, scattered though they\r\nare through an article by him on \"The Philippines as I Saw them.\" He\r\nprobably illustrated his article with what the Bureau of Insular\r\nAffairs sent him, without giving much thought to the matter. But the\r\nBureau of Insular Affairs appears to neglect no occasion to parade the\r\nPhilippine archipelago's sprinkling of non-Christian tribes before\r\nthe American public, fully knowing that the hopes of the Filipinos\r\nfor independence must depend upon impressions received by the American\r\npeople concerning the degree of civilization they have reached.\r\n\r\nFor all these wanton indignities offered their pride and self-respect,\r\nthe Filipinos well know they are primarily indebted to Professor\r\nWorcester and his non-Christian tribe bureau. The feud between the\r\nProfessor and the Filipino people--the bad blood has been growing so\r\nlong that the incident hereinafter related justifies its being called\r\na feud--has been peculiarly embittered by the missionary aspect of\r\nthe non-Christian industry. The great body of the Filipino people,\r\nthe whole six or seven millions of them, are Catholics--most of them\r\ndevout Catholics. Presumably, their desire for salvation by the method\r\nhanded down by their forefathers would not be affected by a change\r\nfrom American political supervision to independence. Yet the darkest\r\nthing ahead of Philippine independence prospects is the Protestant\r\nmissionary vote in the United States. Bishop Brent, Episcopal Bishop\r\nof the Philippines, one of the noblest and most saintly characters\r\nthat ever lived, has devoted his life apparently to missionary work\r\nin the Philippines, having twice declined a nomination as Bishop of\r\nWashington (D.C.). The only field of endeavor open to Bishop Brent and\r\nhis devoted little band of co-workers is the non-Christian tribes. It\r\nseems that the Catholic and Protestant ecclesiastical authorities in\r\nthe Islands get along harmoniously, a kind of modus vivendi having\r\nbeen arranged between them, by which the Protestants are not to do\r\nany proselyting among the seven millions of Catholic Christians. So\r\nthis field of endeavor is the one Professor Worcester has been\r\nindustriously preparing during the last twelve years. Obviously,\r\nevery time Professor Worcester digs up a new non-Christian tribe\r\nhe increases the prospective harvest of the Protestants, thus\r\ncorralling more missionary vote at home for permanent retention of\r\nthe Philippines. Professor Worcester is quoted in a Manila paper as\r\nsaying, \"I am under no delusion as to what may be accomplished for\r\nthe primitive wild people. It takes time to reconstruct them.\" This\r\nremark is supposed to have been made in a speech before the Young Men's\r\nChristian Association of Manila. Neither is Mr. Taft under any delusion\r\nas to how valuable is religious support for the idea of retaining the\r\nPhilippines as a missionary field. The nature of the above allusion to\r\nBishop Brent should certainly be sufficient to show that the writer\r\nyields to no one in affectionate reverence and respect for that rare\r\nand noble character. But neither Bishop Brent nor any one else can\r\npersuade him that it is wise to abandon the principle that Church\r\nand State should be separate, in order that our government may go\r\ninto the missionary business. Since it has become apparent that the\r\nPhilippines will not pay, the Administration has relied solely on\r\nmissionary sentiment. In one of his public utterances Mr. Taft has\r\nsaid in effect, \"The programme of the Republican party with regard\r\nto the Philippines is one which will make greatly for the spread of\r\nChristian civilization throughout the Orient.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing reflections are not intended to raise an issue as to the\r\nwisdom of foreign missions. They are simply intended to illustrate\r\nhow it is possible and natural for President Taft to consider\r\nProfessor Worcester \"the most valuable man we have on the Philippine\r\nCommission.\" The Professor's menagerie is a vote-getter. Also,\r\nPresident Taft's whole Philippine policy being founded upon the theory\r\nthat \"the great majority\" of the Filipino people are in favor of\r\nalien thraldom in lieu of independence, he tolerantly permits their\r\neditors to \"let off steam\" through clamor for independence. This\r\nprivilege they do not fail to exercise to the limit. The attitude\r\nof the Insular Government permits the native press much latitude of\r\n\"sauciness,\" in deference to the American idea about liberty of the\r\npress. In the exercise of this privilege during the last few years\r\nthe native press has gone the limit. However, there was no way to\r\nstop them, on the principle to which we had committed ourselves. The\r\nthing was very mischievous, and became utterly intolerable. There was\r\na native paper called Renacimiento (Renaissance). This paper was long\r\npermitted to say things more or less seditious in character which\r\nno self-respecting government should have tolerated. This was done\r\npursuant to the original theory, obstinately adhered to up to date,\r\nthat there was no real substantial unwillingness to American rule. Of\r\ncourse, if this were true, newspaper noise could do no harm. Therefore\r\nit was permitted to continue. Finally, however, like a boy \"taking a\r\ndare,\" the Renacimiento published an article on Professor Worcester\r\nwhich intimately and sympathetically voiced the general yearning of\r\nthe Filipino people to be rid of the Professor. In so doing, however,\r\nthe hapless editor overstepped the limits of American license, and\r\ngot into the toils of the law, by saying things about the Professor\r\nthat rendered the editor liable to prosecution for criminal libel. The\r\nProfessor promptly took advantage of this misstep, to the great joy of\r\nthe authorities, who had been previously much goaded by independence\r\nclamor. The result was that the paper was put out of business and the\r\neditor was put in jail. No doubt the editor ought to have been put in\r\njail, but his incarceration incidentally served to tone down Filipino\r\nclamor for independence. Subsequent to this coup d'etat, the Professor\r\ndid a little venting of feelings in his turn. He made a speech at\r\nthe Y. M. C. A. on October 10, 1910, which was a highly unchristian\r\nspeech to be gotten off in an edifice dedicated to the service\r\nof Christ. The Manila papers give only extracts from the speech,\r\nand I have never seen a copy of it. From the newspaper accounts,\r\nit seems that the Professor was determined to, and did, relieve his\r\nfeelings about the Filipinos. The Manila Cable-News of October 11,\r\n1910, quotes the Professor as referring to his pets, the non-Christian\r\ntribes, as \"ancestral enemies of the Christians.\" Thus for the first\r\ntime is developed an attitude of being champion of the uncivilized\r\npagan remnant, left from prehistoric times, against the Christians\r\nof the Islands. The Cable-News also says that Professor Worcester\r\n\"laughed at the idea that the Islands belonged to the so-called\r\ncivilized people and held that if the archipelago belonged to any\r\none it certainly belonged to its original owners the Negritos.\" This\r\nremark about the \"so-called civilized people\" was as tactful as\r\nif President Taft should address a meeting of colored people in a\r\ndoubtful state and call them \"niggers.\" Another of the Manila papers\r\ngives an account of the speech from which it appears that the burly\r\nProfessor succeeded in amusing himself at least, if not his audience,\r\nby suggestions as to the superior fighting qualities of the Moros over\r\nthe Filipinos, which suggestions were on the idea that the Moros would\r\nlick the Filipinos if we should leave the country. (The Moros number\r\n300,000, the Filipinos nearly 7,000,000.) The Professor's remarks\r\nin this regard, according to the paper, were a distinct reflection\r\nupon the courage of the Filipinos generally as a people. The effect\r\nof Professor Worcester's speech before the Y. M. C. A. may be well\r\nimagined. However the facts of history do not leave the imagination\r\nunaided. The Philippine Assembly, representing the whole Filipino\r\npeople, and desiring to express the unanimous feeling of those people\r\nwith regard to the Worcester speech, unanimously passed, soon after\r\nthe speech was delivered, a set of resolutions whereof the following\r\nis a translation:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Resolved that the regret of the Assembly be recorded for the\r\n    language attributed to the Honorable Dean C. Worcester, Secretary\r\n    of the Interior of the Philippine Government in a discourse\r\n    before the Young Men's Christian Association, October 10,\r\n    1910. It is improper and censurable in a man who holds a public\r\n    office and who has the confidence of the government. And as the\r\n    statements made as facts are false, slanderous, and offensive to\r\n    the Philippine people, their publication is a grave violation of\r\n    the instructions given by President McKinley which required that\r\n    public functionaries should respect the sensibilities, beliefs,\r\n    and sentiments of the Philippine people, and should show them\r\n    consideration. The words and the conduct of Mr. Worcester tend\r\n    to sow distrust between the Americans and the Filipinos, whose\r\n    aspirations and duties should not separate them but unite them\r\n    in the pathway which leads to the progress and emancipation of\r\n    the Philippine people. The influence of Mr. Worcester has caused\r\n    injury to the feelings of the Filipinos, encouraged race hatred,\r\n    and tended to frustrate the task undertaken by men of real good\r\n    will to win the esteem, confidence, and respect of the Philippine\r\n    people for the Americans.\r\n\r\n    Resolved further that this House desires that these facts should\r\n    be communicated to the President of the United States through\r\n    the Governor of the Philippines and the Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n\r\nPresumably these resolutions were forwarded \"to the President\r\nof the United States through the Governor of the Philippines and\r\nthe Secretary of War.\" But apparently they were pigeonholed when\r\nthey reached Washington. I stumbled on them in the Insular Affairs\r\nCommittee of the House of Representatives whither they had landed\r\nthrough Mr. Slayden of Texas. The distinguished veteran Congressman\r\nfrom Texas, being known as an enemy of all wrong things, was appealed\r\nto by certain persons in the United States to bring the matter to\r\nthe attention of Congress. He did so by presenting to the House of\r\nRepresentatives an American petition which embodied a copy of the\r\nresolutions of the Philippine Assembly.\r\n\r\nIt thus becomes apparent that one of Professor Worcester's principal\r\nelements of value is in bullying the Filipinos, and thereby smothering\r\nmanifestations of a desire for independence, the existence of which\r\ndesire is denied by President Taft's Administration. The more the\r\nFilipinos cry for independence the greater seems the sin of holding\r\nthem in subjection. So that Professor Worcester is very valuable in\r\nsilencing independence clamor and thereby creating an appearance of\r\nconsent of the governed, when there is no consent of the governed\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nIn describing the discontent in distant provinces under brutal\r\npro-consuls, which contributed largely to the final disintegration\r\nof the Roman Empire, Gibbon says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The cry of remote distress is ever faintly heard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe total failure of the above temperate, dignified, and vibrant\r\nprotest of the Philippine Assembly to reach the ears of the American\r\npeople is but another reminder that history repeats itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE PHILIPPINE CIVIL SERVICE\r\n\r\n        Is our Occupation of the Philippines to be temporary,\r\n        like our occupation of Cuba after the Spanish War, or\r\n        \"temporary\" like the British Occupation of Egypt since\r\n        1882? The Unsettled Question.\r\n\r\n        The policy to be pursued is for Congress to determine.\r\n        I have no authority to speak for Congress in respect\r\n        to the ultimate disposition of the Islands.\r\n\r\n              Secretary of War Wm. H. Taft to Philippine Assembly, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress of July 1, 1902, known as the Philippine Government\r\nAct, is entitled \"An Act temporarily to provide\" a government for the\r\nPhilippine Islands. The young American who goes out to the Philippines\r\nto take a position with the Insular Government there has usually\r\nread his share of Kipling, and his imagination likes to analogize\r\nhis prospective employment to the British Indian Civil Service. The\r\nlatter, however, offers a career. But what does the former offer? Take\r\nthe prospects of the rank and file, as set forth by Mr. J. R. Arnold,\r\nof the Executive Bureau of the Philippine Government, in an article\r\npublished in the North American Review for February, 1912. Suppose a\r\nyoung man goes out to the Philippines at a salary of $1200. Mr. Arnold\r\ndiscusses fully and frankly the cost of living in the Islands, and\r\nhow much higher board, lodging, etc., are out there than in the United\r\nStates. He states that board and lodging will cost $15 to $20 a month\r\nmore than here. So that, so far, a salary of $1200 in the Philippines\r\nwould seem equivalent to a salary of say approximately $950 in the\r\nUnited States--say in Washington. Also he calls attention to the\r\nfact that the government will pay your way out, but you must get\r\nback the best way you can. He does not say so, but the walking is not\r\ngood all the way from Manila to Washington. Seriously, according to\r\nthe authority from whom we are quoting, it costs $225 to $300 to get\r\nback. So if you come back at the end of a three years' stay--you must\r\ncontract to stay at least that long--you must have laid by, taking\r\nhis maximum return fare as the more prudent figure to reckon on, one\r\nhundred dollars a year to buy your return ticket. Mr. Arnold does not\r\nsay so, but it is a fact, that various little expenses will creep in\r\nthat are sure to amount, even with the most rigidly frugal, to $50\r\nper annum that you would never have spent in the United States. You\r\nare hardly respectable in the Philippines if you do not have a\r\nmuchacho. Muchacho, in Spanish, means the same as garcon in French,\r\nor valet in English. But muchachos are as thick as cigarettes in the\r\nPhilippines. And you can hire one for about $5 a month. To resolve not\r\nto have a muchacho in the Philippines would be like resolving at home\r\nnever to have your shoes shined, or your clothes pressed. It would be\r\ncontrary to the universal custom of the country, and would therefore be\r\n\"impossible.\" You have not been long in the Philippines before you get\r\ntired of telling applicants for the position of muchacho that you do\r\nnot want one, and, benumbed by the universal custom, you accept the\r\nlast applicant. You must figure on a muchacho as one of your \"fixed\r\ncharges.\" Count then an extra $50 annual necessary expense that you\r\nwould not have at home. If you do not succumb to the muchacho custom,\r\nyou will get rid of the $50 in other ways fairly classifiable as\r\nnecessary current expenses. Thus, if you take from your $1200, worth\r\n$950 in Manila, as above stated, the $100 per annum necessary to be\r\nlaid by against your home-coming, and the other $50 last suggested,\r\nyour salary of $1200 per annum in Manila becomes equivalent to one of\r\n$800 at home, so far as regards what you are likely to save by strict\r\nhabits of economy. In other words, to figure how you are going to come\r\nout in the long run, if you go out as a $1200 man, while your social\r\nposition will be precisely that of a man commanding the same salary\r\nin a government position in Washington, you must knock off a third of\r\nthe $1200. This is not the way Mr. Arnold states the case exactly. I\r\nam simply taking his facts, supplemented by what little I have added,\r\nand stating them in a way which will perhaps illustrate the case\r\nbetter to some people. Mr. Arnold says you are apt to get up as high\r\nas $1500 and finally even to $1800 in three to five years. Suppose\r\nyou do have that luck. Still, if, as has been made plain above, you\r\nmust consider $1200 in Manila as equal to only $800 in Washington\r\n(so far as regards what you are going to be able to save each year),\r\nby the same token you must consider $1500 in Manila as being equal\r\nto only $1000 in Washington, and $1800 as only $1200.\r\n\r\nThe utmost limit of achievement in the Philippine Government service,\r\nthe only one of the higher positions not subject to political caprice,\r\nthe only one regarded out there as a \"life position\"--and this excepts\r\nneither the Governorship of the Islands nor the Commissionerships--is\r\nthe position of Justice of the Supreme Court. The salary is $10,000\r\nper annum, American money. But there is not an American judge on that\r\nbench who would not be glad at any moment to accept a $5000 position\r\nas a United States District Judge at home. All of them whom I know\r\nare most happily married. But I believe their wives would quit them\r\nif they refused such an offer from the President of the United States,\r\nor else get so unhappy about it that they would accept and come home.\r\n\r\nWhile we have now considered the case from bottom to top, we did not\r\noriginally figure on the young American going out to the Philippines\r\notherwise than single. In this behalf Mr. Arnold himself says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I do not think it can be fairly called other than risky for\r\n    an American to attempt to practise love in a cottage in the\r\n    Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\nSays the late Arthur W. Fergusson--who gave his life to the Philippine\r\nCivil Service--in his annual report for 1905, as Executive Secretary:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The one great stumbling-block, and which no legislative body\r\n    can eradicate, is the fact that very few Americans intend to\r\n    make the Philippines their permanent home, or even stay here\r\n    for any extended period. This is doubtless due to the location\r\n    of the islands, their isolation from centres of civilization\r\n    and culture, the enervating climate, lack of entertainment and\r\n    desirable companionship, and distance from the homeland. Every\r\n    clerk, no matter what his ideals or aspirations, realizes after\r\n    coming here that he must at some time in the future return to\r\n    the United States and begin all over again. After spending a\r\n    year or more in the islands, the realization that the sooner the\r\n    change is made the better, becomes more acute. This condition\r\n    causes, doubtless, the class of men who are not adventurous or\r\n    fond of visiting strange climes to think twice before accepting\r\n    an appointment for service in these islands, and generally to\r\n    remain away, and a great majority of those who do come here to\r\n    leave the service again after a very short period of duty. [497]\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Fergusson comes to the obvious but apparently unattainable\r\nremedy, which he says is\r\n\r\n\r\n    to make a Philippine appointment a permanent means of livelihood\r\n    by providing an effective system of transfers to the Federal\r\n    service after a reasonable period of service here. * * * Under\r\n    the present regulations influence must be brought to bear at\r\n    Washington in order that requisition may be made by the Chief of\r\n    some bureau there for the services of a clerk desiring to transfer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou see, if a Washington Bureau, say the Coast and Geodetic Survey,\r\nor the Geological Survey, sends a man out to the Islands, he is never\r\nfor a moment separated from the Federal Civil Service or the Federal\r\nGovernment's pay-roll. The same is true of civilian employees of the\r\narmy. But the man in the Insular Service, when he wants to get back\r\nhome, is little better off than if he were in the employ of the Cuban\r\nGovernment, or the British Indian Government, or that of the Dutch\r\nEast Indies. Mr. Fergusson also says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is believed to be useless to try to influence men to come out\r\n    here unless there is something permanent offered to them at the\r\n    expiration of a reasonable term of service. * * * The average\r\n    European is content to live and die \"east of Suez\"; the average\r\n    American is not. * * * I am firmly convinced that a permanent\r\n    service under present conditions is entirely out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow can you have \"a permanent service\" unless you have a definite\r\ndeclared policy? Why not declare the purpose of our Government with\r\nthe regard to the Islands?\r\n\r\nIn his annual report for 1906 [498] Mr. Fergusson says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Our relations to the islands are such that the education and\r\n    specialization of a distinct body of high class men purposely\r\n    for this service as is done in England for the Indian service,\r\n    will probably be always a practical impossibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe then goes on to reiterate his annual plea for a law providing for\r\ntransfer as a matter of right, not of influence, from the Philippine\r\nCivil Service to the Federal Civil Service in the United States,\r\nand tells of a very capable official of his bureau who got a chance\r\nduring the year just closed to transfer from the Philippines to a\r\n$1400 government position in the United States, and was glad to get\r\nit, although $1400 was \"considerably less than half what he received\r\nhere.\" Mr. Fergusson quickly gives the key to all this in what he calls\r\n\"the haunting fear of having to return to the States in debilitated\r\nhealth and out of touch with existent conditions, only to face the\r\nnecessity of seeking a new position.\" He adds:\r\n\r\n\r\n    That this is not a mere theory is proven by the number of army\r\n    (civilian) employees who contentedly remain year after year.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1907, Mr. Fergusson reports on the same subject [499]: \"Matters\r\ndo not seem to be improving,\" and that the Director of the Insular\r\nCivil Service informs him that \"during the fiscal year there were five\r\nhundred voluntary separations from the service by Americans, of whom\r\none hundred were college graduates.\" He adds: \"When the expense of\r\ngetting and bringing out new men, and of training them to their new\r\nwork is considered, the wastefulness of the present system is evident.\"\r\n\r\nYou do not find any quotations from any of the Fergusson disclosures\r\nin Mr. Arnold's North American Review article. He would probably have\r\nlost his job, if he had quoted them. Yet the evils pointed out by\r\nMr. Fergusson come from one permanent source, the uncertainty of the\r\nfuture of every American out there, due to the failure of Congress\r\nto declare the purpose of the Government.\r\n\r\nOn January 30, 1908, Arthur W. Fergusson died in the service of the\r\nPhilippine Government. No general law putting that service on the basis\r\nhe pleaded for to the day of his death has ever yet been passed. Since\r\nhis death, his tactful successor appears to have abandoned further\r\npleading, and concluded to worry along with the permanently lame\r\nconditions inherent in the uncertainty as to whether we are to keep\r\nthe Islands permanently or not, rather than embarrass President Taft\r\nby discouraging young Americans from going to the Islands.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Governor-General of the Philippines for 1907,\r\nGovernor Smith, says [500]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    American officials and employees have rarely made up their minds\r\n    to cast their fortunes definitely with the Philippines or to make\r\n    governmental service in the tropics a career. Many of those who\r\n    in the beginning were so minded, due to ill health or the longing\r\n    to return to friends or relatives, changed front and preferred to\r\n    return to the home land, there to enjoy life at half the salary\r\n    in the environment to which they were accustomed. * * * That\r\n    which operates probably more than anything else to induce good men\r\n    drawing good salaries to abandon the service * * * is the knowledge\r\n    that they have nothing to look forward to when broken health or\r\n    old age shall have rendered them valueless to the government.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf Congress should ever care to do anything to improve the Philippine\r\nCivil Service and the status of Americans entering the same, certainly\r\nthe one supremely obvious thing to do is to make transfer back to\r\nthe civil service in the United States after a term of duty in the\r\nIslands a matter of right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nCOST OF THE PHILIPPINES\r\n\r\n                If 't were well to do right, 't were better still\r\n                if 't were more profitable.\r\n\r\n                                                           Cynic Maxims.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral Otis's annual report for 1899, [501] dated August 31st, gives\r\nthe number of Americans killed in battle in the Philippines, from\r\nthe beginning of the American occupation to that date, as 380. This\r\nincludes those wounded who afterwards died of such wounds. His report\r\nfor 1900, [502] covering the period from his 1899 report to May 5,\r\n1900, gives the number of Americans killed in battle from August 31,\r\n1899, to May 1, 1900, as 258. General MacArthur succeeded General\r\nOtis in command of the American forces in the Philippines on May 5,\r\n1900. General MacArthur's annual report for 1901, [503] gives the\r\nnumber of Americans killed in battle between May 5, 1900, and June 30,\r\n1901, as 245. Thus the total number of Americans killed in battle up\r\nto the time the Civil Government was set up in 1901, was 883. The\r\nmilitary reports do not always give the insurgents killed during\r\nthe periods they cover. But on June 4, 1900, as we saw in a previous\r\nchapter, General MacArthur reported the number of Filipinos killed\r\nup to that time, so far as our records showed, to be something over\r\n10,000. General MacArthur's report, above quoted, giving our killed\r\nfor the period it covers (May 5, 1900, to June 30, 1901), at 245,\r\ngives the insurgent killed for the same period as 3854. If we add this\r\n3854 to the 10,000 killed up to about where May merged into June in\r\n1900, we have 13,854 Filipinos killed up to the time Judge Taft was\r\ninaugurated as Governor, in 1901. There was no record, of course,\r\nobtainable or attempted, by the Eighth Army Corps, of Filipinos who\r\nwere wounded and not captured and who subsequently died. It is quite\r\nsafe to assume that such fatalities must have swelled the enemy's list\r\nup to the time of the setting up of the Civil Government far above\r\n16,000 killed. Thus, as has heretofore been stated, the ratio of the\r\nenemy's loss to our loss was, literally, at least 16 to 1, up to the\r\ntime the civil government was set up. General MacArthur's report for\r\n1900 [504] would seem to bear out the above ratio. He there gives the\r\nnumber of our killed, from November 1, 1899, to September 1, 1900,\r\nincluding the wounded who afterwards died of such wounds, at 268, and\r\nthe Filipinos killed, \"as far as of record,\" 3227. While these last\r\nfigures make our killed for the period they relate to, considerably\r\nover 200, and the enemy's killed but a very small figure over 3200,\r\nstill, making allowances for the enemy's wounded that died afterwards,\r\nof which of course we have no record, the 16 to 1 ratio would seem to\r\ngive a fairly accurate probable estimate of the relative loss of life.\r\n\r\nThese figures are explained by the facts, already noticed hereinbefore,\r\nthat most of our people knew how to shoot and the Filipinos did\r\nnot. The great part of their army were raw recruits who did not\r\nunderstand the use of two sights on a rifle, and frequently relied\r\nsolely on the one at the muzzle, not even lifting up the sight near\r\nthe lock which when not in use lies flat along the gun-barrel, with\r\nthe result that they almost invariably got the range too high and\r\nshot over our heads.\r\n\r\nBecause the military reports overlap each other in many instances,\r\nit is not possible to state accurately how many men the Eighth Army\r\nCorps lost by disease, but our loss chargeable to this account was\r\nnot far from our fatalities on the battlefield. [505]\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to even approximate the enemy's loss other than\r\non the battlefield. The United States Coast and Geodetic Survey\r\nPhilippine Atlas gives the table estimating the population of the\r\nvarious provinces of the Philippine archipelago prior to the American\r\noccupation. This estimate gives the population of Batangas province\r\nat 312,192. The American Census of the Philippines of 1903 gives\r\nthe population of Batangas province at 257,715. [506] This would\r\npresent a difference in the population of Batangas prior to 1898 and\r\nits population after the war of 54,477. The provincial secretary of\r\nBatangas province made a report to Governor Taft on December 18, 1901\r\n[507] on the condition of the province generally. This report, as it\r\nappears in the Senate Document, is a translation from the Spanish. The\r\nportion which relates to the reduction of the population of Batangas\r\nprovince reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The mortality, caused no longer by the war, but by disease,\r\n    such as malaria and dysentery, has reduced to a little over\r\n    200,000 the more than 300,000 inhabitants which in former years\r\n    the province had.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course these appalling figures [508] must be taken with a grain\r\nof salt. In the first place, the man who furnished them was merely\r\nreproducing the general impression of his neighbors as to the\r\ndiminution of the population of the province. He does not pretend\r\nto be dealing with official statistics. On the other hand, all of\r\nthe yearly reports of the various native provincial officers are,\r\nas a general rule, pathetically optimistic. They all seem to think\r\nit their duty to present a hopeful view of the situation. In fact if\r\nyou read these reports one after the other, the various signers seem\r\nto vie with one another in optimism as if their tenure of office\r\ndepended upon it. So that, balancing probabilities, it would seem\r\nunlikely that the provincial secretary of Batangas would have stated\r\nmore than what he at least believed to represent actual conditions,\r\nand the results of the war. A comparison of the Atlas population\r\ntables above mentioned with the census tables of 1903 shows no very\r\nstartling difference in the population of any of the other provinces\r\nof the archipelago before and after the war except Batangas. It is\r\nalso notorious that Batangas suffered by the war more than any other\r\nprovince in the Philippine Islands. However, a glance at the table\r\nof population of the various provinces of the Census of 1903 [509]\r\nshows you fifty provinces with a total of 7,635,426 people. While\r\nwe will never know whether Batangas did or did not lose one hundred\r\nthousand as a result of the war and its consequences, still, if it did,\r\nthe other forty-nine provinces above mentioned must have lost as many\r\nmore, that is to say, must have lost another hundred thousand. So that\r\nwhile it is all a matter of surmise, with nothing more certain to go on\r\nthan the foregoing, it would really seem by no means absurd to assume\r\nthe Filipino loss of life, other than on the battlefield, caused by the\r\nwar, and the famine, pestilence, and other disease consequent thereon,\r\nat not far from 200,000 people. In more than one province, the people\r\ndied like flies, especially the women and children, as a result of\r\nconditions incident to and consequent upon the war. This will not\r\nseem an over-statement to men who have lived much among people that\r\ndo not know much about how to take care of themselves in the midst\r\nof great calamities, people who will eat meat of animals carried off\r\nby disease, in time of famine; who will drink water contaminated by\r\nwhat may for euphony be called sewage; and who are unprovided with\r\nany save traditional home remedies against cholera, small-pox, etc.\r\n\r\nAs to the cost of the Philippines in money, it used to be said\r\nin the early days that we paid $20,000,000 for a $200,000,000\r\ninsurrection. Just what the Islands have cost us up to date in money\r\nit is utterly impossible to figure out with any degree of certainty,\r\nexcept that a safe minimum may be arrived at. Said the distinguished\r\nCongressman from Texas, Honorable James L. Slayden, in a speech which\r\nappears in the Congressional Record of February 25, 1908 (pp. 2532\r\net seq.):\r\n\r\n\r\n    On this point, and in reply to a resolution of the Senate in\r\n    1902, the Secretary of War reported that the cost of the army\r\n    in the Philippines from June 30, 1898, to July 1, 1902, had been\r\n    $169,853,512.00. To this let us add $114,515,643.00, the admitted\r\n    cost of the army in the Philippines from May 1, 1902, to June 30,\r\n    1907, and we will have a grand total of $284,369,155.00. That\r\n    does not take into account the additional cost of the navy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNor, be it noted, does it count the $20,000,000 we paid Spain for\r\nthe Islands, which item, is, however included in another part of\r\nMr. Slayden's speech.\r\n\r\nThe only other estimate of what the Islands have cost, made in the\r\nlast few years, which seems to be specially worthy of consideration,\r\nis one which appeared in the New York Evening Post of March 6,\r\n1907. This estimate was prepared by one of the best trained and\r\nmost conservative newspaper men in the United States, Mr. Edward\r\nG. Lowry, then Washington correspondent of the Evening Post, and\r\nsince 1911, its managing editor. The total which Mr. Lowry arrives\r\nat is $308,369,155, up to that time. There have been various absurd\r\nestimates made recklessly without knowledge, but Mr. Lowry's estimate\r\nis very carefully studied out, and presented in detail in the newspaper\r\nreferred to. From the testimony of Mr. Slayden and Mr. Lowry, given\r\nas a result of their inquiries into the matter, it would thus seem\r\nthat the Islands must have cost us by the end of 1907 something like\r\n$300,000,000. The Insular Government is now self-sustaining, except\r\nas to military affairs.\r\n\r\nThe cost per annum of the Philippine (native) scouts, of which there\r\nare 4000, is paid out of the United States Treasury, and amounts\r\nto $2,000,000 per annum. [510] The number of American troops in the\r\nislands for the last few years has been about 12,000. Those who are\r\nwedded to the present Philippine policy of indefinite retention\r\nwith undeclared intention, insist that our military expenses in\r\nthe Philippines, in respect to the regular army out there, are not\r\nfairly chargeable as a part of the current expenses of the Philippine\r\noccupation. This argument must be admitted to have some force as far\r\nas the navy is concerned, but as to the army it is clearly without\r\nmerit. Under the Act of Congress reorganizing the army of the United\r\nStates after the Spanish War, provision was made for a skeleton army\r\nof about 60,000 men capable of expansion to something like 100,000\r\nin time of war. The method of expansion thus contemplated was to have\r\ncompanies of, say, for illustration, sixty men, in time of peace, which\r\ncompanies could be recruited up to a war footing of one hundred men,\r\nin time of war. The suggestion that the cost of the part of the regular\r\narmy which we have to keep in the Philippines is not chargeable to\r\nthe Philippines because those same troops would have to be somewhere\r\nin the United States if they were not where they are, is not well\r\ntaken. If we did not need 12,000 men continually in the Philippines,\r\nthe army could be at once reduced by that much without affecting its\r\npresent organization. If we had no troops in the Philippines this would\r\nnot mean the absolute elimination from the army of enough regiments\r\nto represent twelve thousand men. It would not eliminate any existing\r\norganization. It would simply mean contraction of the number of men in\r\nthe several companies of the several regiments of the army toward a\r\npeace basis to the extent of a total of twelve thousand men, more or\r\nless. The War Department has long figured on the cost of an American\r\nsoldier in the Philippines per annum including his pay, allowances,\r\nand transportation out and back, at $1000 per annum. The cost of\r\n12,000 soldiers at $1000 per annum is $12,000,000, per annum. The\r\nconclusion would, therefore, seem inevitable that the extra military\r\ncurrent expense chargeable to our occupation of the Philippines is\r\n$12,000,000, per annum, outside the Philippine scouts, or, a total\r\nof $14,000,000. Even if the Philippines have cost us $300,000,000,\r\nthat is no reason why we should continue to run a kindergarten for\r\nadults out there, and let the Monroe Doctrine run to seed. \"Something\"\r\nis not \"bound to turn up.\" The Philippine Islands will not prove a\r\nblessing in disguise. In every war with a nation having discontented\r\ncolonial subjects, the enemy will always strike the colony first,\r\nand hope for aid from the inhabitants thereof.\r\n\r\nEven if the Philippines have cost us $300,000,000, we are a nation\r\nof nearly 100,000,000 people. So they have cost us, all told, in\r\nthe neighborhood of only about $3 a piece. And we subjugated them by\r\nmistake, after freeing a less capable people, the Cubans.\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal is to be finished in 1913. This means a splendid,\r\nbut free-for-all contest, for the trade of South America. In South\r\nAmerica we will meet a tremendous pro-German sentiment, and a by no\r\nmeans inconsiderable anti-\"Yankee\" sentiment. The bigger Germany's\r\narmy and navy grows, the more she will loom up as the one great\r\nmenace to the peace of the world, and the one avowed enemy of the\r\nMonroe Doctrine. We need to build up a Pan-American esprit de corps,\r\nbased on the instinct of self-defence. We must win the good will of\r\nSouth America, and we cannot do it so long as we insist, in another\r\npart of the world, upon the righteousness of the principle of one\r\nChristian people policing a weaker Christian people, ostensibly to\r\nkeep them from having revolutions, and really in the hope of ultimate\r\nprofit. To free the Filipinos should be the first step we take after\r\nthe Panama Canal is completed toward getting ourselves foot-loose\r\nentirely, with a view of getting everything from the Canadian border\r\nto the Argentine wheat fields and beyond, solidly and sincerely\r\nfor the Monroe Doctrine. In that direction lies our only sensible\r\nand reasonable hope that the canal will get for us the trade and\r\nfriendship of South America. With such tremendous issues at stake,\r\nwhat does it matter to the richest nation on earth what the Philippines\r\ncost? What does it matter, anyhow, how much it costs to do right?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n        Taxation without representation is good cause for revolt.\r\n\r\n                                                American Speech of 1776.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a colony of Spain the Philippines enjoyed certain special\r\nprivileges in the way of trade with the \"mother country.\" When at the\r\nbeginning of our military occupation in 1898 General Otis detailed\r\nan army officer to take charge of the Customs House, he continued\r\nfor the time being the Spanish tariff laws concerning imports and\r\nexports. On September 17, 1901, the Philippine Commission passed\r\na tariff act [511] fixing the duties on imports into the Islands\r\nand also continuing to a considerable extent the system of duties\r\non Philippine exports inherited from the Spanish regime. Among the\r\nproducts of the Philippine Islands on which the Act of September 17,\r\n1901, imposed an export tax were the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hemp, 75c. per 100 kilos [512]; sugar, 5c. per 100 kilos;\r\n    manufactured tobacco, $1.50 per 100 kilos; raw tobacco, $1.50\r\n    down to 75c. per 100 kilos. [513]\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 8, 1902, the United States Congress passed an Act,\r\n\"temporarily to provide revenue for the Philippine Islands and for\r\nother purposes.\" The Act of 1902 re-enacted the Commission's tariff\r\nlaw for the Philippines of September 17, 1901, with one change,\r\nhereinafter to be discussed, as to its export tax features. As\r\nto the tariffs to be collected at our custom-houses on Philippine\r\nproducts shipped to the United States, the Act of 1902 reduced the\r\nrates fixed by the Dingley tariff to seventy-five per cent. of said\r\nrates. That was all Congress did in the way of lowering our tariff\r\nwall to Philippine products until 1909, when the Payne-Aldrich tariff\r\nbill became a law. This twenty-five per cent. reduction was no better\r\nthan no reduction whatever would have been.\r\n\r\nGovernor Taft pleaded very earnestly with Congress, at the time\r\nof the passage of the Philippine Tariff Act of March 8, 1902, for a\r\nsubstantial reduction of the Dingley tariff rate on sugar and tobacco,\r\nso as to give his \"constituents\"--his Filipinos--something in lieu\r\nof the markets they had had under Spain. But our sugar and tobacco\r\ninterests defeated his efforts, because they feared what they termed\r\n\"competition with cheap Asiatic labor.\"\r\n\r\nThe Act of Congress of March 8, 1902, repealed the export duties\r\nimposed by the Act of the Philippine Commission of September 17,\r\n1901, as to exports to the United States, leaving unrepealed,\r\nhowever, the export duty on Philippine products shipped to foreign\r\ncountries. Section 2 of said Act of 1902 provided, as to exports\r\nfrom the Philippines to the United States, that the rates of duty\r\nupon products of the Philippine Archipelago coming into the United\r\nStates, should be less any duty or tax levied, collected, and paid\r\nthereon (under the Act of the Philippine Commission of September\r\n17, 1901, aforesaid) upon the shipment thereof from the Philippine\r\nArchipelago. This sounds liberal enough. It is, as far as it goes. But\r\nwhat those familiar with the hemp infamy of the Act of 1902 call\r\n\"the joker\" in it, is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    All articles, the growth and product of the Philippine Islands,\r\n    admitted into the ports of the United States free of duty\r\n    under the provisions of this act, and coming directly from said\r\n    islands to the United States, for use and consumption therein,\r\n    shall be hereafter exempt from any export duties imposed in the\r\n    Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis also sounds liberal, on first reading, but its object was, and\r\nits effect has been, to enable the American Hemp Trust to corner\r\nand control the Manila hemp industry. There is but one article of\r\nPhilippine export which any one in the United States is interested\r\nin, that was admitted into the United States free of duty under the\r\nDingley Act. [514] That article is hemp. The object of the law was\r\nto favor Americans interested in exporting hemp from Manila to the\r\nUnited States as against Europeans exporting it to England and other\r\nforeign countries. This does not look, on its face, either unpatriotic\r\nor un-Christian. It is not unpatriotic or un-Christian, ordinarily,\r\nto favor your own people, as against their foreign competitors. The\r\nmoral quality of such favoritism, however, must depend on who is to\r\npay for it. Under the Act of 1902, the Manila authorities have always\r\ncollected an export tax on hemp coming to the United States, just as\r\nthey do on hemp going from Manila to foreign countries, exactly as\r\nif the law abolishing the export tax on hemp coming to the United\r\nStates had never been passed. Later, on proof that the hemp was in\r\nfact carried to the United States and used and consumed therein, they\r\nrefund the export tax. This is on the idea that they cannot tell where\r\nthe hemp is going to until they know where it went to, nor where it\r\nis going to be \"used and consumed\" until they know where it was in\r\nfact finally \"used and consumed.\" Of course the small farmer is in\r\nno position to follow his bale of hemp into the markets of the world\r\nand show, if it happens to go to the United States, that it did in\r\nfact go there and that it was there \"used and consumed,\" and, finally\r\nobtaining the proof of this, submit it to the Manila Government and\r\nget his little export tax on his bale of hemp refunded. Only the big\r\nbuyer's agents at Manila are in a position to do this. So the hemp\r\ncrop is bought and moved under conditions which are the same as if\r\nall hemp were subject to an export tax. And only the big fish get\r\nthe benefit. For instance, the International Harvester Company has\r\nits hemp buyers at Manila. And as to the part of the Philippine hemp\r\ncrop it handles, it can, of course, follow the hemp to its ultimate\r\nconsumption in the United States, make the proof, and get the refund.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the Philippines is practically entirely\r\nagricultural. Neither mining nor manufactures cut any appreciable\r\nfigure. Hemp, sugar, tobacco, and copra [515] are the chief staples\r\nand main exports, and of the first of these Secretary of War Taft\r\nsays in one of his reports: [516]\r\n\r\n\r\n    The chief export in value and quantity from the Philippines is\r\n    Manila hemp, it amounting to between 60 and 65 per cent. of the\r\n    total exports.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us see just how far, according to the annual reports of our\r\nown agents in the Philippines--those charged by us with governing\r\nthem,--this piece of legislation gotten through by \"special privilege\"\r\nhas depressed the Manila hemp industry, the chief source of wealth of\r\nthe Islands. And before we even get to the main trouble, let us permit\r\nthe Insular Government to \"place on the screen,\" as a preliminary\r\n\"view,\" a glance at what the instinct of self-preservation of American\r\nsugar and tobacco interests, fearing competition from \"cheap Asiatic\r\nlabor,\" have deemed it necessary to do to the Philippine sugar and\r\ntobacco industries, through the Dingley tariff. The annual report of\r\nthe Philippine Commission for 1904, before it gets to the subject of\r\nhemp, draws a most gloomy picture of how we killed the markets for\r\nsugar and tobacco the Islands had under Spain, and gave them none\r\ninstead. They speak of \"the languishing state of these industries\"\r\n(p. 26), and describe a state of affairs that sounds more like Egypt\r\nunder Pharaoh than anything else, including a cattle disease that\r\ncarried off ninety per cent. of the beasts of burden of the country,\r\nand wholesale destruction of crops by locusts. [517] What they have to\r\nsay of the annual tribute levied by the American Hemp Trust, through\r\nCongress, on the Manila hemp industry, should not be re-stated,\r\nbut quoted. They say: [518]\r\n\r\n\r\n    We desire to call attention to the injustice effected upon the\r\n    revenues of the islands by section 2 of the Act of Congress\r\n    approved March 8, 1902, which provides that the Philippine\r\n    Government shall refund all export duties imposed upon articles\r\n    exported from the islands into and consumed in the United\r\n    States. Under the provisions of this section there has been\r\n    collected in the Philippine Islands, since its enactment down to\r\n    the close of the fiscal year 1904, the sum of $1,060,460.20 United\r\n    States currency, which is refundable. These refundable duties\r\n    are principally upon hemp exportations to the United States,\r\n    and are in effect a gift of that amount to the manufacturers of\r\n    the United States who use hemp in their operations.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey add:\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is manifestly a discrimination in favor of our manufacturers\r\n    as against those of foreign countries. No good reason is perceived\r\n    why this bounty to American manufacturers should be extracted from\r\n    the treasury of the Philippine Islands, and it is respectfully\r\n    submitted that the law authorizing it should be repealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the Philippine Commission for 1905, after the\r\nusual complaint about being made a political football by Benevolent\r\nAssimilation on the one side, and Louisiana and our sugar-beet\r\nStates on the other, and the usual annual and true description of\r\nthe consequent poverty, says concerning hemp:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We have several times in our reports called attention to the\r\n    practical workings of that portion of the Act of Congress approved\r\n    March 8, 1902, which provides for the refund of duties paid\r\n    on articles exported from the Philippine Islands to the United\r\n    States and consumed therein, and have as repeatedly recommended\r\n    its repeal. It is a direct burden upon the people of the Philippine\r\n    Islands, because it takes from the insular treasury export duties\r\n    collected from the people and gives them to manufacturers of hemp\r\n    products in the United States. These manufacturers were already\r\n    prosperous before this bounty was given them and it seems hardly\r\n    consistent with our expressions of purpose to build up and develop\r\n    the Philippine Islands when we are thus enriching a few of our\r\n    own people at their expense. [519]\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the end of the fiscal year 1905 (June 30), the American importers of\r\nManila hemp--of whom the International Harvester Company and its allied\r\ninterests are the most influential--had, under the operation of the\r\nrebate system based on the Act of 1902, milked the Philippine people to\r\nthe tune of about $1,000,000. Says the Philippine Commission's annual\r\nreport for 1905, immediately after the passage last above quoted:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The amount of duties refunded under this act to manufacturers in\r\n    the United States during the three years ending June 30, 1905,\r\n    is $1,057,251.12. Many of the departments of the government are\r\n    much hampered in their operations because of the lack of funds,\r\n    notably the bureau of education, and were the sum thus taken\r\n    available for educational purposes, to say nothing of any other,\r\n    the government would be enabled to give instruction to thousands\r\n    of Filipino children whom they are now unable to reach and who\r\n    must remain steeped in ignorance because of the lack of funds to\r\n    provide such instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSaid the Manila Chamber of Commerce to the Taft Congressional party in\r\nAugust, 1905: \"The country is in a state of financial collapse.\" [520]\r\n\r\nSays the Philippine Commission's report for 1906 (pt. 1, p. 68):\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Commission has repeatedly called attention in its reports\r\n    to the action of Congress providing for a refund of duties paid\r\n    on articles exported from the Islands to the United States and\r\n    consumed therein. The reasons that led the Commission heretofore to\r\n    recommend the repeal of that provision are still operative. Since\r\n    the passage of that act on March 8, 1902, the amount of duties\r\n    collected and paid into the Philippine treasury and handed over\r\n    to manufacturers in the United States down to June 30, 1906,\r\n    is $1,471,208.47. This money has been taken out of the poverty\r\n    of the insular treasury to be delivered directly into the hands\r\n    of manufacturers of cordage and other users of Philippine hemp in\r\n    the United States for their enrichment. The cordage interests are\r\n    prosperous and do not need this help; the Philippine Islands are\r\n    poor. Legislation which takes money directly from the Philippine\r\n    treasury and passes it over to a particular industry in the United\r\n    States is not founded on sound principles of political economy\r\n    or of justice to the Filipinos. We renew our recommendation for\r\n    the repeal of this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou also find in the Commission's report for 1906 the usual\r\nannual protests against the Dingley tariff on Philippine sugar and\r\ntobacco. Said the Honorable Henry C. Ide in an article in the New York\r\nIndependent for November 22, 1906, written shortly after he retired\r\nfrom the office of Governor-General of the Philippines and returned\r\nto the United States: \"By annexation we killed the Spanish market for\r\nPhilippine sugar and tobacco, and our tariff shuts these products\r\nfrom the United States market, and to-day both these [industries]\r\nare practically prostrated.\" In their annual report for 1907,\r\nthe Philippine Commission say with regard to the American corner on\r\nPhilippine hemp: [521] \"The price of hemp has fallen from an average of\r\ntwenty pesos ($10 American money) per picul [522] to thirteen pesos\r\nper picul.\" It thus appears that by judicious manipulation of the\r\nhemp market at Manila, through the leverage of the refund system,\r\nbased on collection and subsequent refunding of the export tax on\r\nhemp coming to the United States, the Manila agents of the American\r\nhemp manufacturers had, as early as 1907, beat the price of hemp down\r\nto not far above half of what it had been formerly. To-day (1912)\r\nthe Filipino hemp farmer gets for his hemp just one half what he got\r\njust ten years ago. During all this period of economic depression,\r\nthe public utterances and State papers both of President Roosevelt\r\nand Mr. Taft are full of such preposterous stuff as the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No great civilized power has ever managed with such wisdom and\r\n    disinterestedness the affairs of a people committed by the accident\r\n    of war to its hands. [523]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is what Mr. Roosevelt and Mr. Taft were publicly pretending to\r\nbelieve. But at practically the same time, during as dark a year,\r\neconomically, as the American occupation has seen, 1907, let us see\r\nwhat they were privately admitting to their intimate friends.\r\n\r\nIn the North American Review for January 18, 1907, in an article\r\ncontributed to that Review by the author of this volume, our\r\ntreatment of the Philippine people, through our Congress, was briefly\r\ndiscussed. The article chanced to attract the attention of Mr. Andrew\r\nCarnegie, who gave a considerable sum of money to have it reprinted and\r\ndistributed. Some correspondence followed between us, in the course\r\nof which Mr. Carnegie stated that he had been at the White House\r\nshortly before writing me, and described what happened as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When at supper with the President [Mr. Roosevelt] recently,\r\n    pointing to Judge Taft [then Secretary of War], who sat opposite,\r\n    he [President Roosevelt] said: \"Here are the two men in all the\r\n    world most anxious to get out of the Philippines.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another letter Mr. Carnegie described this same incident, this other\r\nletter's version of President Roosevelt's supper-table remark being:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Here are the two men in America most anxious to get rid of them\r\n    [the Philippines]. [524]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow why all this public boasting about our \"disinterestedness,\"\r\nwhen, if he had been a Filipino, Colonel Roosevelt would probably\r\nhave hunted up all the American speeches of 1776 about taxation\r\nwithout representation, and played hide-and-seek with the public\r\nprosecutor at Manila, to see how far he could violate the sedition\r\nstatute without getting in jail? And why this private admission\r\nto his friend Mr. Carnegie, which neither he nor Mr. Taft has ever\r\npublicly made? Why did he not send a message to Congress showing up\r\nthe hemp rebate system? Simply because to do so would lose support\r\nfor the Administration, would alienate powerful interests from the\r\nfatuous policy of Benevolent Assimilation bequeathed to Mr. Roosevelt\r\nby Mr. McKinley. His party was irrevocably committed to indefinite\r\nretention of the Islands. It was like Lot's wife. It could not turn\r\nback. So the protected and subsidized interests were permitted to\r\ncontinue to prey upon the Philippine people. Tariff evils were never\r\nPresident Roosevelt's specialty. Nor has war against intrenched\r\nprivilege of any sort ever been Mr. Taft's specialty. Mr. Taft went\r\nout to the Philippines in 1907 to open the Philippine Assembly. In\r\n1908 he came back and made a report to President Roosevelt which is\r\nas bland as his Winona declaration that the Payne-Aldrich bill is\r\n\"the best tariff bill the Republican party ever passed.\" It makes\r\nthe American reader's heart swell with pious pride at what he is\r\ndoing for his \"little brown brother,\" in the matter of vaccination,\r\nsewers, school-books, and the like. President Roosevelt sent this\r\nreport to Congress, accompanied by a message, from which we have\r\nalready quoted. In that same message he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    I question whether there is a brighter page in the annals of\r\n    international dealing between the strong and the weak than the\r\n    page which tells of our doings in the Philippines.\r\n\r\n\r\nApparently, Messrs. Roosevelt and Taft thought, in 1907, that granting\r\nthe Filipinos a little debating society solemnly called a legislative\r\nbody, but wholly without any real power, was ample compensation for\r\ndeserted tobacco and cane plantations and for the price of hemp being\r\nbeat down below the cost of production by manipulation through an Act\r\nof Congress passed for the benefit of American hemp manufacturers. If\r\nwe had had a Cleveland in the White House about that time, he would\r\nhave written an essay on taxation without representation, with the\r\nhemp infamy of this Philippine Tariff Act of 1902 as a text, and sent\r\nit to Congress as a message demanding the repeal of the Act. But the\r\ngood-will of the Hemp Trust is an asset for the policy of Benevolent\r\nAssimilation. The Filipino cannot vote, and the cordage manufacturer in\r\nthe United States can. No conceivable state of economic desolation to\r\nwhich we might reduce the people of the Philippine Islands being other\r\nthan a blessing in disguise compared with permitting them to attend\r\nto their own affairs after their own quaint and mutually considerate\r\nfashion, the Hemp Trust's rope, tied into a slip-knot by the Act of\r\n1902, must not be removed from their throats. By judicious manipulation\r\nof sufficient hemp rope, you can corral much support for Benevolent\r\nAssimilation. Therefore, to this good hour, the substance of the hemp\r\npart of the Philippine Tariff Act of March 8, 1902, remains upon the\r\nstatute books of the United States, to the shame of the nation.\r\n\r\nAt last, under the Payne tariff law of 1909, Mr. Taft's long and\r\npatient quiet work with Congressional committees prevailed upon\r\nCongress and the interests to admit Philippine sugar and tobacco to\r\nthis country free of duty, up to amounts limited in the Act. [525]\r\nSince then you find the reports of our American officials in the\r\nPhilippines palpitating with gratitude to Congress. As a matter\r\nof fact all Congress had said to the Filipinos by its action may be\r\nsummed up about thus: \"The sugar and tobacco interests of this country\r\nhave at last realized that such little of the sugar and tobacco you\r\nraise as may stray over to this side of the world will not be in the\r\nleast likely to hurt them. Therefore they have graciously decided,\r\nin their benignity, to permit you to live, provided you do not get\r\ntoo prosperous.\" But this very same Payne bill continued the export\r\ntax features of the Act of 1902. Section 13 of the Payne bill is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Section 13. That upon the exportation to any foreign country from\r\n    the Philippine Islands, or the shipment thereof to the United\r\n    States or any of its possessions, of the following articles\r\n    there shall be levied, collected, and paid thereon the following\r\n    export duties: Provided, however, that all articles the growth\r\n    and product of the Philippine Islands coming directly from said\r\n    islands, to the United States or any of its possessions for use\r\n    and consumption therein shall be exempt from any export duties\r\n    imposed in the Philippine Islands:\r\n\r\n    352. Abaca (hemp), gross weight, 100 kilos, 75 cents.\r\n    353. Sugar, gross weight, 100 kilos, 5 cents.\r\n    354. Copra, gross weight, 100 kilos, 10 cents.\r\n    355. Tobacco, gross weight:\r\n\r\n    (a) Manufactured or unmanufactured, except as otherwise provided,\r\n    100 kilos, $1.30.\r\n\r\n    (b) Stems, clippings, and other wastes of tobacco, 100 kilos,\r\n    50 cents.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us briefly glance at the net results of this law, and its\r\npredecessor, the Act of 1902, the export features of which it\r\nre-enacted. It is important that every fair-minded American who can\r\npossibly spare the time should take such a glance at what Congress has\r\ndone to the Philippine hemp industry, because of the obvious bearing\r\nthat such taxation without representation will probably have on the\r\nattitude of the Philippine people whenever we get into a war with a\r\nforeign power. Certainly the legislation Congress has perpetrated upon\r\nthem, at the behest of special interests in the United States, has not\r\nsoothed the original desire of those people to be free and independent.\r\n\r\nAt page 27 of the report of the Philippine Collector of Customs for\r\n1910, a table is given showing the export duties subject to refund\r\ncollected under the Act of Congress of March 8, 1902, and deposited\r\nin the Philippine treasury to the credit of the Insular Government\r\nat the end of each fiscal year (June 30), as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                    1902        $  71,064.69\r\n                    1903          527,228.10\r\n                    1904          462,433.83\r\n                    1905          486,475.56\r\n                    1906          433,991.79\r\n                    1907          433,458.58\r\n                    1908          370,513.36\r\n                    1909          598,917.69\r\n                               -------------\r\n                               $3,384,083.60\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following table, taken from this same annual report of the\r\nCollector of Customs of the Philippines for 1910 (p. 22) shows the\r\nsize (weight in kilograms), and value, of the annual Philippine hemp\r\ncrop from 1899 to 1910, both inclusive.

For instance, take the last year, 1910: 99,305,102 kilos\r\nat 75 cents per 100 kilos is $744,788.26, which is more than 4%\r\nof $17,404,922, the total value of the hemp crop of the archipelago\r\nfor that year. Add this $744,788.26 to the $3,384,183.60 shown by the\r\nabove table of refundable duties collected from 1902 to 1909 inclusive,\r\nand you have over $4,000,000 rebates accruing to American importers\r\nof Manila hemp from 1902 to 1910 inclusive.\r\n\r\nIn his remarks on Section 13 of the Payne Law of 1909 (above set\r\nforth), in the House of Representatives, May 13, 1909, [526] Hon. Oscar\r\nW. Underwood said, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n    When you put a tax on your people for engaging in export trade,\r\n    to that extent you lessen their ability to successfully meet\r\n    their foreign competitor and reduce the territory in which they\r\n    can successfully dispose of their surplus products abroad. Our\r\n    forefathers in writing the Constitution of the United States,\r\n    recognizing the false principle on which an export tax was based,\r\n    put it in the fundamental law of our land that the United States\r\n    Government should not lay export taxes. If we enact this law,\r\n    we write into the statute book for the Philippine Islands,\r\n    legislation which is little short of barbarous, legislation that\r\n    no government in the civilized world except Turkey, and Persia,\r\n    and other second-class nations countenance to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut the hemp interests won out and the section was adopted. In an\r\nargument for the repeal of the export tax, delivered in the House of\r\nRepresentatives August 19, 1911, the Philippine delegate, Hon. Manuel\r\nL. Quezon, said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    There is one section in the Philippine tariff law, approved\r\n    August 5, 1909, which is seriously injuring the proper commercial\r\n    development of the islands.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course the earnestness with which Mr. Quezon pleaded his cause may\r\nbe imagined from the circumstance that, as he says, he is continually\r\nadvised by letters from his people, and verily believes that if the\r\nexport tax is not taken off soon the Philippine hemp industry will be\r\nentirely destroyed, and the hemp farmers will have to take to raising\r\nsomething else in lieu of hemp, because the present prices hardly\r\npermit them to live. In the course of his speech Mr. Quezon offered\r\nthe following truly eloquent and absolutely unanswerable argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Although it has been decided by the Supreme Court of the United\r\n    States that the provisions of the Constitution are not in force in\r\n    the Philippines, I have serious doubts as to whether said decision\r\n    also meant that this Government has the power to enact laws for\r\n    the islands which are expressly prohibited by the Constitution\r\n    in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is through the courtesy of Mr. Quezon that such light as I may\r\nhave been able to throw on the subject has been obtained. He has\r\nshown me letters from the Philippine Chamber of Commerce at Manila\r\nand other commercial organizations prophesying ruin to the Manila\r\nhemp industry in the event the export tax should continue. One of\r\nthese letters is addressed to the two Philippine Commissioners in\r\nCongress, Mr. Legarda and Mr. Quezon. It informs them of the hopes of\r\nthe Filipinos at Manila that they, Messrs. Legarda and Quezon, may be\r\nsuccessful in their campaign to get the law repealed and that many\r\nof them (the Filipinos at Manila) feel hopeful of results in that\r\nregard. Speaking for their fellow countrymen at Manila, they say,\r\n\"The optimists are of the opinion that the matter being in such good\r\nhands as yours will be carried to a successful conclusion.\" Then they\r\ngive the darker side of the picture thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    But the representatives at this capital of the famous syndicate,\r\n    the International Harvester Company, are of the opinion that we\r\n    will be able to accomplish nothing, and theirs is an opinion to\r\n    which great weight should be attached, because the vast interests\r\n    which that concern represents can set in motion powerful influences\r\n    to keep the present law as it is, since it concerns their interest\r\n    to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Quezon has also shown me a letter written to him, March 30, 1911,\r\nby his and my warm personal friend, Hon. James F. Smith, formerly\r\nGovernor-General of the Philippines, now (1912) Judge of the Court of\r\nCustoms Appeals at Washington, D. C., in which letter General Smith\r\nsays, concerning the operation of that part of the export tax act of\r\nMarch 8, 1902 (continued by the Payne Tariff Law of 1909) by which\r\nAmerican manufacturers are relieved from the payment of the export\r\ntax on Manila hemp:\r\n\r\n\r\n    In effect this really and truly amounts to the payment by the\r\n    Philippine Government and the Filipino people of a large subsidy\r\n    to American manufacturers of hemp. More than that, this concession\r\n    to the American manufacturer, by enabling him to undersell his\r\n    British competitor, gives him an undue control of the situation\r\n    and has put him in a position, to some extent, to control prices\r\n    for the raw product.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that the American people had better look to their\r\nown liberties, when they remember that in the campaign for the\r\nRepublican nomination in 1912, the Roosevelt Headquarters gave out\r\nthat pending the Roosevelt dictation of Mr. Taft's nomination in\r\n1908, the International Harvester Company furnished a floor of its\r\nChicago building to the Taft people, this interesting fact being\r\npart of the leakage from the Roosevelt-Taft quarrel caused by the\r\nRoosevelt charge that Mr. Taft was unfit for re-election because he\r\n\"meant well feebly\"; and when it is recalled, on the other hand, that\r\nin the Roosevelt campaign of 1912 for the presidential nomination for\r\na third term, Mr. George W. Perkins, [527] the very personification\r\nof undue corporation influence with the Government, assumed the role\r\nof Warwick for an ex-President who, when President, had repudiated\r\nthe advice of his counsel, Governor Harmon, that a railroad company\r\n[528] be prosecuted for taking rebates because the vice-president of\r\nthe company was his personal friend. [529] But let us return to the\r\nPhilippine rebates, and their corner-stone, the export tax, Section\r\n13 of the Payne-Aldrich Tariff.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Fairbanks vs. United States, 181 U. S. Supreme Court\r\nReports, page 290, a case in which the court was asked to declare a\r\ncertain Act of Congress unconstitutional and void, because it imposed\r\nwhat was virtually an export tax, the opinion of the court cites\r\nthe absolute inhibition against such a tax imposed by our Federal\r\nConstitution, and says concerning the wise theory on which this\r\nfundamental tenet of our government rests:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The requirement of the Constitution is that exports should be\r\n    free from any governmental burden.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision then goes on to elaborate on what it terms \"that freedom\r\nfrom governmental burden in the matter of exports which it was the\r\nintention of our Constitution to protect and preserve.\" Finally,\r\nthe court uses an expression which is certainly a stinging rebuke to\r\nany law-making power that permits the selfish greed of a little set\r\nof importers to get a law passed imposing for their special benefit\r\na paralyzing export tax on the chief staple of a helpless colony:\r\n\r\n\r\n    The power to tax is the power to destroy.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Quezon has no vote in Congress and his voice was not heard,\r\nat least not heeded.\r\n\r\nThe summation of the whole matter is this: Both the Philippine\r\npeople and the American people are, and long have been, suffering\r\nfrom unjust taxation through laws for which special selfish financial\r\ninterests in the United States, exercising grossly undue influence on\r\ngovernmental action, are responsible. Neither will ever get relief\r\nuntil the government of this nation is wrested from the control\r\nof the money-hogs and restored to the people. Until that is done,\r\nselfish greed will continue to sow sedition in the Philippines,\r\nand socialism in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF MAN\r\n\r\n                        The rights of man cannot be changed. It is\r\n                        the government which attempts to change them\r\n                        that must change.--Webster.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the homely common sense of Mr. Lincoln that first reminded\r\nus most vividly how like to the sins of an individual are those of a\r\nnation. To the Southern man who admires Mr. Lincoln as one of the great\r\nfigures of all time, he seems like a great physician, who, with malice\r\ntoward none and with charity for all, kept vigil for four years at the\r\nbedside of a sick nation through all the long agony of its efforts to\r\nthrow off from its system the inherited curse of slavery. Of course,\r\nhuman slavery was a relic of barbarism. But in fixing the Rights of\r\nMan, the founders of the Republic actually overlooked the fact that a\r\nnegro was a human being. So that, vast property rights having accrued\r\npursuant to that mistake, the march of progress had to wipe them out,\r\nno matter whom it hurt financially. The enormity of the iniquity of\r\nhuman slavery did not dawn suddenly and exclusively upon William Lloyd\r\nGarrison. He is not the sole, original inventor and patentee of the\r\nidea. Lord Macaulay's father was doing the same sort of agitating in\r\nEngland about the same time. Westminster Abbey has its monument to\r\nthe elder Macaulay, just as Commonwealth Avenue has its monument to\r\nthe elder Garrison. Simultaneous like stirrings occurred elsewhere\r\nthroughout Christendom. But, of course, in America, arguments for\r\nthe emancipation of the slave first took root most readily in a\r\nthrifty section of our liberty-loving country which had nothing to\r\nlose by abolition.\r\n\r\nJohn Quincy Adams once said that our government was \"an experiment\r\nupon the heart of man.\" It is because this government of the people\r\nby the people for the people was a deliberate and thoughtful attempt\r\nupon the part of its founders to apply the Golden Rule as a doctrine\r\nof international and inter-individual law, that we believe our form\r\nof government is the last hope of mankind. It is, as we conceive\r\nit, the voice of humanity raised in protest against the proposition\r\nthat might makes right. It is, as we conceive it, a government which\r\nentered the lists of the nations as the champion of the human mind,\r\nin the great struggle of Mind for the mastery over Matter, the\r\nworld-old struggle between Good and Evil, Light and Darkness. Our\r\ngovernment, like everything else, must follow the law of its being,\r\nor die. Its first great sin in violation of the Rights of Man was due\r\nto heredity. We inherited the institution of slavery, the governmental\r\nexception to the rule that all men are created with equal right to\r\nlife, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. This was a sin against\r\nhuman liberty, one of the \"unalienable\" Rights of Man, upon which\r\nthe Republic purported to be builded. The consequences of that sin\r\nare still with us; but, except for the occasional bloody-shirt waver,\r\nwhose intellectual resources are not sufficient to provide him with a\r\nlive issue, we are meeting those consequences, as a nation, bravely,\r\nand with the mutual forbearance born of the fact that none are wholly\r\nfree from responsibility for present difficulties.\r\n\r\nOur second great national sin was a yielding to the temptation of\r\nthe environment which arose, unforeseen, after a splendid war waged\r\nfor the Rights of Man against Spain in Cuba. The Philippine war was\r\nwaged to subjugate the Filipino people, because Mr. McKinley believed\r\nit would be financially profitable to us to own the islands, and in\r\nthe face of the fact that the only thing he knew officially about\r\nthe Filipino people was that Admiral Dewey thought them superior\r\nto the Cubans and more capable of self-government. The war in the\r\nPhilippines was, therefore, a war against the Rights of Man. Nowhere\r\nin any state paper has any American statesman, soldier, or sailor,\r\nhad the temerity to invoke the name of God in connection with the\r\nretention of the Philippine Islands. Nowhere in any American state\r\npaper connected with the Philippines is there any reference to \"a\r\ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind.\" The sin of our Philippine\r\npolicy is that it is a denial of the right of a people to pursue\r\nhappiness in their own way instead of in somebody else's way. It is a\r\ndenial of the very principles in maintenance of which we went to war\r\nagainst Spain to free Cuba, as we had previously gone to war against\r\nEngland to free ourselves.\r\n\r\nNow the reason the nation blundered into taking the Philippines was\r\nthat it believed the Filipinos to be, not a people, but a jumble\r\nof savage tribes. But the reason the men who controlled the action\r\nof the government at the time took the Philippines was because they\r\nbelieved they would pay. Nevertheless, there was a sufficient number\r\nof our fellow-citizens--controlled, some by altruistic motives and\r\nsome by sordid motives--to cause the nation to follow the lead of\r\nthose then in control. If the men then in control had taken the people\r\ninto their confidence, the blunder would never have been made. If the\r\ncorrespondence between Mr. McKinley and the Paris Peace Commission\r\nin the fall of 1898, from which the injunction of secrecy was not\r\nremoved until 1901, had been given out at the time, the treaty would\r\nnever have been ratified except after some such declaration as to\r\nthe Philippines as was made concerning Cuba, some reaffirmance of\r\nallegiance to faith in our cardinal tenet--the right of every people\r\nto pursue happiness in their own way, free from alien domination. The\r\nBacon resolution of 1899, which was along this line, was defeated only\r\nby the deciding vote of the presiding officer, the Vice-President of\r\nthe United States. The passage of that resolution would have prevented\r\nthe Philippine Insurrection. Had it passed, the Filipinos would no more\r\nhave had occasion to think of insurrection than the Cubans did. It was\r\nMr. McKinley alone who decided to take the Philippines. Congress was\r\nnot called together in extra session. The people were not consulted,\r\nexcept from the rear-end of an observation car.\r\n\r\nMost people, whether they be lawyers or not, are more or less\r\nacquainted with the doctrine of what is called in law a \"bona\r\nfide purchaser without notice.\" No man can claim to be a bona fide\r\npurchaser without notice, when he knows enough about the subject\r\nmatter of his purchase to put him on reasonable notice of the\r\nexistence of facts which, had he taken the trouble to verify them,\r\nwould have caused him to halt and not purchase. The correspondence\r\nin 1898, made public in 1901, withheld by Mr. McKinley until after\r\nhis second election in 1900, is sufficient to have made any honest\r\nman ask himself some such question as this: \"After all, is it not\r\nquite possible that those people can run a decent government of\r\ntheir own? Admiral Dewey says they are superior to the Cubans.\" But\r\nMr. McKinley did not pursue this inquiry, as it was his duty to\r\ndo. He took the islands because he believed they would pay, knowing\r\nnothing in particular about the Filipinos, except what he had learned\r\nfrom Admiral Dewey's brief comment, yet hoping in spite of it that\r\nthey would turn out sufficiently unfit for self-government for the\r\nevent to vindicate the purchase. To demonstrate that the Filipinos\r\nwere wholly unfit for the treatment accorded the Cubans was the only\r\npossible justification of the initial departure from the traditions of\r\nthe Republic and from the principles which were its corner-stone. And\r\nhe made the departure because the business \"interests\" of the country\r\nthen believed--erroneously they all now admit--that it would pay. He\r\ndecided to treat eternal principles as \"worn-out formulae.\" Senator Hoar\r\nonce declined an invitation extended by his own city of Worcester,\r\nto deliver a eulogy on Mr. McKinley, because of his Philippine\r\npolicy. True, he tempers the asperity of this action thus: \"It was\r\nnot because I was behind any other man in admiration or personal\r\naffection for that lofty and beautiful character. But * * * if a great\r\nCatholic prelate were to die, his eulogy should not be pronounced\r\nby a Protestant.\" [530] But all Senator Hoar's speeches against the\r\nMcKinley Philippine policy were as emphatic as Luther's ninety-five\r\ntheses. He was in possession at the time, along with the rest of the\r\nSenate, of the correspondence with the Paris Peace Commission made\r\npublic after the presidential election of 1900.\r\n\r\nEver since Mr. McKinley took the Philippines, it has been the awkward\r\nbut inexorable duty of the defenders of that good man's fame to\r\ndeprecate Filipino capacity for self-government. President Taft's\r\nchief life-work since this century began has been to take care\r\nof his martyred predecessor's fame, by proving that Mr. McKinley\r\nguessed right in 1898 when he bought the Philippines and trusted\r\nto luck to be able to make out, in spite of what Admiral Dewey had\r\nsaid, a case sufficiently derogatory to Filipino intelligence to\r\njustify the purchase and subjugation of the islands at the very\r\ntime we were freeing Cuba. Obviously, then, the more utterly unfit\r\nfor self-government in the present or the near future Mr. Taft can\r\nmake the Filipinos out, the nearer he gets to vindicating the memory\r\nof Mr. McKinley, that is, with men of his own, (Mr. Taft's) high\r\ncharacter. He insists on treating as children a people who got up a\r\nwell-armed army of thirty-odd thousand men in three or four months\r\nand held at bay, for two years and a half, some 125,000 husky American\r\nsoldiers, over five times as many as it took to drive Spain from the\r\nWestern hemisphere. Physical force is the basis of all government\r\namong men. If President Taft had anything of the soldier instinct\r\nof his immediate predecessor, he would not sniff demagoguery in the\r\nproposition that military efficiency is a better guaranty of capacity\r\nfor self-government than all the school-books in the world, and that\r\nproven passionate willingness to die for freedom from alien domination\r\nis the best guaranty conceivable against internecine strife. It was\r\na tremendous struggle with his own conscience that Mr. McKinley went\r\nthrough with before he decided to repudiate the principles on which we\r\ntook Cuba in order, for a money consideration euphemistically called\r\n\"trade expansion,\" to take the Philippines. He had advices before him\r\nat the time making it reasonably certain that this meant trouble with\r\nthe Filipinos, i.e., bloodshed in the Philippines, the extent of which\r\nnone could foresee, and about which he was of course apprehensive. In\r\nthe matter of instructing our Paris Peace Commissioners to insist on\r\nSpain's ceding us the Philippines, Mr. McKinley took no moral ground\r\ntenable like a rock, such as truly great men take in great crises of\r\ntheir country's history. He did not attempt to lead the people. He\r\nsimply decided that it would be a popular thing to do to take the\r\nislands. Fresh from a war entered upon to emancipate the Cubans from\r\nalien domination, he took a step which both Admiral Dewey and General\r\nMerritt warned him beforehand would probably mean war--to subjugate,\r\nagainst their will, a people superior to the Cubans. And in taking\r\nthis step, he took into his confidence, neither the people who paid\r\nfor the war, nor the soldiers who fought it. To deny that his motives\r\nwere benevolent would be simply stupid. But he followed the mob which\r\nshouted from the rear-end of his observation car and repeated by cable\r\nto the Paris Peace Commission, what the mob yelled. Ever since the\r\nsupposed Philippine Klondyke whispered in President McKinley's ear\r\n\"Eat of the imperial fruits of a colonial policy,\" the archives of\r\nthis government--the reports of the State, War, and Navy Departments,\r\nand the Congressional Documents--have reeked with the inevitable\r\nconsequences of our fall from our high estate. No man can serve two\r\nmasters. Philanthropy for pecuniary profit is a paradox. Duplicity\r\never follows deviation from principle. In our dealings in 1898 with\r\nAguinaldo you find vacillation on the part of military commanders who\r\npersonally did not know what fear was, and embarrassed hypocrisy in\r\ndealing with him on the part of men wearing the shoulder-straps of the\r\nAmerican army, athwart the frankness of whose gaze no such shadow had\r\never fallen before. You find systematic concealment of our intentions\r\nin dealing with the insurgents, for fear they would insurge before the\r\nTreaty was signed, and thus cause such a revulsion of feeling in our\r\ncountry against the purchase of theirs as to defeat the ratification\r\nof the treaty. After that, you find a systematic minimizing of\r\nthe opposition to our rule, reinforced by subtle depreciation of\r\nFilipino intelligence, and backed up by a \"peace-at-any-price\" policy,\r\nperiodically punctuated by the horrors of war without its dignity. The\r\ndenial of Filipino opposition to our rule, which opposition means\r\nmerely a natural longing for freedom from alien rule, has gradually\r\nbeen abandoned. Nobody now clings to that stale fiction. Also, a long\r\ncourse of chastening, through reconcentration and kindred severities\r\nsubsequent to the official announcement of a state of general peace,\r\nhas at last gotten the situation as to public order well in hand. The\r\nonly question for those who affect that \"decent respect to the opinions\r\nof mankind\" which the men of 1776 had in mind is, \"Are the Filipinos\r\na people?\" President Taft was originally with Senator Hoar on the\r\nPhilippine question. At least he was an \"anti-expansionist.\" In all\r\nthe heat of subsequent controversy he has never made bold to deny\r\nthe general proposition of the unalienable right of every people to\r\nliberty and the pursuit of happiness in their own way. His position\r\nis that the Filipino people must be made an exception to the rule\r\nbecause they are not a people. This is the strongest I can state his\r\nproposition for him. It is very difficult to state even with apparent\r\nplausibility, anything which denies the right of every community of\r\npeople to immunity from alien domination. The case must be an extreme\r\none. The issue which the writer raises with the President's policy\r\nis that the Filipinos are a people.\r\n\r\nI know of no graver responsibility that an American statesman can\r\ntake upon himself before the bar of history than to deny the right\r\nof any given people to self-government. Certainly any man who denies\r\nthat right at least assumes the burden of proof that they are unfit\r\nto attend to their own affairs. Mr. McKinley assumed it without\r\npretending to know anything much about the Filipinos, the motive being\r\nthat the Islands would be profitable to us. When Mr. Taft went to the\r\nPhilippines in 1900, he went, not to investigate the correctness of\r\nMr. McKinley's assumption, which was implied in the purchase, but to\r\nchampion it; not to give advice concerning the righteousness of having\r\ntaken over the Philippines, but to bolster up the policy. He assumed\r\nthe burden of proof before he knew anything about the facts. The\r\nburden has been on him ever since. Any subordinate who helps him\r\nto bear that burden, finds favor in his eyes. But the burden is\r\ngreater than he can bear. The proof fails. The proof shows that the\r\nFilipino people ought to be allowed to pursue happiness in their\r\nown way instead of being made to pursue it in Mr. Taft's way. Once\r\nyou pretend that our true object in the Philippines is the \"pursuit\r\nof happiness\" for them, The Taft policy is condemned by the facts;\r\nand that is why I am opposed to it. The record shows this. He admits\r\nit. But he insists, with a sigh, that in some other generation they\r\nwill be happy. Meantime, we are drifting toward our next war carrying\r\nin tow 8,000,000 of human beings who, if neutralized and let alone\r\nwould not be disturbed by our next war, but whose destinies now must\r\nbe dependent upon the outcome of such war, however little they may\r\nbe concerned in the issues which bring it about.\r\n\r\nThe shifty opportunism which once actually held out to the Filipinos\r\nthe hope of some day becoming a State of the United States of America,\r\nhas long since lapsed into the silence of shame, because no American\r\never honestly believed that the American people would ever countenance\r\nany such preposterous proposition. And so a free republic based on\r\nrepresentative government is face to face with the proposition of\r\nhaving a \"crown colony\" on its hands which wishes to be, and could\r\nsoon be made fit to be, a free republic also.\r\n\r\nIf a federal republic cannot live half slave and half free, can it\r\nlive with millions of the governed denied a voice in the federal\r\ngovernment confessedly forever?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE ROAD TO AUTONOMY\r\n\r\n                                Oh be ye not dismayed\r\n                                Though ye stumbled and ye strayed.\r\n\r\n                                         Kipling--A Song of the English.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who points out a wrong without being prepared to suggest a remedy\r\npresumes upon the patience of his neighbor without good and sufficient\r\ncause. Up to this point the wrong has been unfolded, with such ability\r\nas was vouchsafed the narrator, \"from Genesis to Revelations,\" so to\r\nspeak; also his own attitude as an eye-witness, and its evolution from\r\nthe Mosaic doctrine of an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,\r\nto the more Christian doctrines of the New Testament. Let us now\r\nconsider the remedy.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our travels with the army in the earlier chapters of\r\nthis book, we first followed its northern advance, from Manila over\r\nthe great central plain drained by the Rio Grande and crossed by the\r\nrailroad connecting Manila Bay with Lingayen Gulf; its further advance\r\nfrom the northern borders of the plain over the mountains of Central\r\nLuzon; and its march from the central mountains to the northern sea,\r\nat the extreme northern end of the archipelago. We thus saw in detail\r\nthe military conquest and occupation of that part of Luzon lying\r\nnorth of the Pasig River. Before leaving that part of the subject, the\r\nway the provinces thus occupied were grouped into military districts\r\nwas indicated. Following the lines of the military occupation, it was\r\nshown that Northern Luzon was naturally and conveniently susceptible of\r\ndivision into four groups of provinces, which groups might ultimately\r\nbe evolved into self-governing commonwealths--States of a Philippine\r\nFederal Union, as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Name of State     Area (sq. m.)    Population\r\n\r\n    Ilocos [531]          6,500           650,000\r\n    Cagayan [532]        12,000           300,000\r\n    Pangasinan [533]      4,500           625,000\r\n    Pampamga [534]        5,000           650,000\r\n                         ------         ---------\r\n    Total                28,000         2,225,000\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that after our narrative had followed the\r\noccupation of Northern Luzon by the American forces to practical\r\ncompletion, we turned to that part of Luzon lying south of Manila,\r\nand followed the military occupation as it was gradually extended\r\nfrom the Pasig River to the extreme point of Southern Luzon. Before\r\nclosing the review of that military panorama, suggestions were made\r\nfor an ultimate grouping of the provinces of Southern Luzon into two\r\ngovernmental units intended to be ultimately evolved into states. Those\r\nsuggestions contemplated grouping the provinces of the lake region\r\nbordering on the Laguna de Bay and the adjacent provinces, into a\r\nterritory designated for convenience as Cavite. [535] This territory\r\nwas to include all of Southern Luzon except the hemp peninsula,\r\nwhich lies to the south of the Lake country. It was also suggested\r\nin the same connection that the three provinces of the hemp peninsula\r\nmight form a convenient ultimate State of Camarines. In other words,\r\ntwo states can be made out of Southern Luzon as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Name of State    Area (sq. m.)      Population\r\n\r\n    Cavite              8,500              700,000\r\n    Camarines           7,000              600,000\r\n                       ------            ---------\r\n    Total              15,500            1,300,000\r\n\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate: All of Luzon except Manila and the vicinity\r\ncan at once be divided into the six groups of provinces above\r\nmentioned--\"territories,\" having what we are accustomed in the United\r\nStates to call a \"territorial form of government,\" and intended to\r\nbe made states later. Luzon is about the size of Cuba (a little over\r\n40,000 sq. miles), is twice as thickly populated (nearly 4,000,000 to\r\nCuba's 2,000,000), and is not cursed with a negro question, as Cuba is.\r\n\r\nThe above totals, be it remembered, are only round numbers, but\r\nthey get us \"out of the woods\" so to speak, and away from a lot of\r\nunpronounceable names. They show you how to handle Luzon as if it were\r\nabout the size of Ohio--which it is. And, as has already been made\r\nclear in the earlier part of this volume, Luzon \"is\" the Philippines,\r\nin a very suggestive sense of the phrase, since it contains half the\r\nland area of the archipelago (outside of the Mohammedan island of\r\nMindanao), and half the total population of the whole archipelago,\r\nbesides being eight or ten times as large as any other island of the\r\ngroup except Mindanao; and it also contains the city which is the\r\ncapital and chief port of the archipelago, and has been the seat of\r\ngovernment for over three hundred years--Manila. And Manila is eight\r\nor ten times as large as any other town in the archipelago.\r\n\r\nAfter the occupation of Luzon, General Otis's extension of our\r\noccupation to the Visayan islands was reviewed, and in that connection\r\nit was pointed out that each of the six largest of those islands to\r\nwit, Panay, Negros, Cebu, Leyte, Samar, Bohol, might be ultimately\r\nevolved into six states. [536]\r\n\r\nThe smaller islands lying between Luzon and Mindanao could easily be\r\ndisposed of governmentally by being attached to the jurisdiction of\r\none of the said six islands.\r\n\r\nThere is to-day no reason why a dozen Americans could not be at\r\nonce appointed governors of the twelve prospective autonomous\r\ncommonwealths above indicated, just as the President of the United\r\nStates has in the past appointed governors for New Mexico, Arizona,\r\nand other territories of the United States which have subsequently\r\nbeen admitted to the Union. If the Congress of the United States should\r\npromise the Filipinos independence, to be granted as soon as American\r\nauthority in the Islands should so recommend, the dozen territorial\r\ngovernments intended to be evolved into states of an ultimate federal\r\nunion could soon be whipped into shape where they could take care of\r\nthemselves to the extent that our state governments to-day take care\r\nof themselves. American representatives of American authority in the\r\nIslands, sent out to work out such a programme, might be instructed\r\nto watch these twelve territorial governments, granting to each the\r\nright to elect a governor in lieu of the appointed governor as soon\r\nas in their judgment a given territory was worthy of it. I have no\r\ndoubt that such recommendations would follow successively as to all\r\nof said prospective states inside of four or five years. Whether this\r\nplan is wise or not, it certainly is not, as far as I am concerned,\r\n\"half baked.\" Some five years ago, in the North American Review,\r\n[537] I suggested that Luzon could be so organized within less than\r\nten years by American territorial governors selected for the work,\r\nnaming the Honorable George Curry of New Mexico, formerly Governor of\r\nthe territory of New Mexico, and now a member of Congress therefrom,\r\nas an ideal man to organize one such territory. It is true that there\r\nare not eleven other men as well qualified for the work as Governor\r\nCurry. In fact he is probably better qualified for the work than\r\nany man living. The language used as to Governor Curry in the North\r\nAmerican Review article referred to was as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If the inhabitants of these regions were told by a man whom they\r\n    liked and would believe, as they would Curry, that they were to\r\n    have autonomous governments like one of the Western Territories\r\n    of the United States, at the very earliest possible moment,\r\n    and urged to get ready for it, they could and would, under his\r\n    guidance. We would get a co-operation from those people we do not\r\n    now get and never will get, so long as we keep them in uncertainty\r\n    as to what we are going to do with them. If next year we should\r\n    formally disclaim intention to retain the islands permanently, and\r\n    set to work to create autonomous Territories destined ultimately\r\n    to be States of a Federated Philippine Republic, whenever fit,\r\n    we would soon see the way out of this tangle, and behold the\r\n    beginning of the end of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever the twelve territorial governments should be gotten into\r\nsmooth working order under elected native governors, the Philippine\r\narchipelago would then be nearly ready for independence, so far as\r\nits internal affairs are concerned. The danger of their being annexed\r\non the first pretext by some one of the great land-grabbing powers\r\nshould be met by our guaranteeing them their independence, as we\r\ndo Cuba, until they could be protected by neutralization treaties,\r\nsuch as protect Belgium and Switzerland to-day, as explained in\r\nthe chapter which follows this. Powers not specifically granted\r\nto the several states-in-embryo should of course, until the final\r\ngrant of independence, be reserved to the central government at\r\nManila. Manila and Rizal province would be available at almost any\r\ntime as a thirteenth state. So that when the twelve states above\r\nsuggested had shown themselves capable of local self-government,\r\nManila and Rizal province might be added to make the final one of\r\nthirteen original states of a Philippine Republic.\r\n\r\nAny American who has seen a Filipino pueblo transformed, as if by\r\nmagic, from listless apathy to a state of buzzing and busy enthusiasm\r\nsuggestive of a bee-hive, by preparations for some church fiesta,\r\nor for the coming of some dignitary from Manila, has seen something\r\nanalogous to what would happen if the Filipino body politic should\r\nsuddenly be electrified by a promise of independence under some such\r\nprogramme as the above. A generous rivalry would at once ensue all\r\nover the archipelago in each of the twelve prospective states. Each\r\nwould seek to be the first to be recommended by American authority as\r\nready for statehood. I do not believe the annals of national experience\r\ncontain any analogy where every member of a given community has rallied\r\nto a common cause more completely than the whole Filipino people would\r\nrally to such a prospective programme of independence. The unanimity\r\nwould be as absolute as the kind we saw among the American people at\r\nthe outbreak of the Spanish War, when Congress one fine morning placed\r\nfifty millions of dollars at the disposal of President McKinley by\r\na unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nI especially invite attention to the fact that the above programme\r\nthrows away nothing that has been done by us in the Islands in the\r\nlast twelve years in the way of organization. It simply takes it and\r\nbuilds upon it. Congress should not attempt to work out the details\r\nfrom this end of the line. We should send men out there from here to\r\nwork them out, with local co-operation from the leading Filipinos. Men\r\nanimated by the idea of working out a programme under which the living\r\nmay hope to see the independence of their country, should be sent out\r\nto take the place of the men now there who are irrevocably committed\r\nto the programme of indefinite retention with undeclared intention,\r\nwhich holds out no hope to the living. It is not wise to arrange\r\nthe details of the programme by act of Congress without a year or\r\ntwo of study of the situation by such men on the ground. An act of\r\nCongress which goes into details before getting the recommendations\r\nof such men will inevitably set up a lot of straw men easy for the\r\nother side to knock down. All you need is a program, sanctioned by\r\nCongress, containing a promise of independence, and men sent out to\r\nthe islands to work out the program. They would report back from time\r\nto time, and the Congress by whose authority they went out would have\r\nno hesitation in being guided by their recommendations. If unpatriotic\r\ngreed for office among the Filipinos, or other opposition animated by\r\nevil motives, should block the game, your Americans so sent out would\r\nhave to recommend the calling of a halt. This ever-present shadow\r\nin the background would in turn throw the shadow of ostracism over\r\nall demagogues.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Filipinos should be given a Senate, or upper house,\r\nin which, the thirteen prospective \"states\" should be represented by\r\ntwo men, the bill therefor to be framed out there, and sent back here\r\nto Congress for approval. This would give them under the plan here\r\nsuggested, as soon as the Americans sent out should so recommend,\r\na Senate of twenty-six members. At present, if the native Assembly,\r\nor lower house, does not pass the annual appropriations necessary\r\nto run the government, the appropriation act of the preceding year\r\nagain becomes law. At present, the upper house is the Philippine\r\nCommission. By withholding its consent, it can prevent any legislation\r\nwhatsoever. So, at present, the Assembly is little more than a debating\r\nsociety. All questions as to appropriations, veto of legislation, and\r\nother details, in the event the Filipinos are given a Senate also,\r\nshould be left to be fixed in the bill recommended by the men sent\r\nout to work out the program of promise.\r\n\r\nOn March 20, 1912, Honorable W. A. Jones, the distinguished veteran\r\nCongressman from Virginia, who is Chairman of the Committee on Insular\r\nAffairs, introduced in the House of Representatives a bill entitled\r\n\"A bill to establish a qualified independence for the Philippines, and\r\nto fix the date when such qualified independence shall become absolute\r\nand complete.\" The greater part of what precedes this paragraph of\r\nthis chapter was written prior to March 20, 1912. Mr. Jones's bill\r\nworks out the details of the independence problem in a manner somewhat\r\ndifferent from the plan I suggest, but that does not make me any the\r\nless heartily in favor of the principle which his bill embodies. The\r\nsupreme virtue of the Jones bill is that it promises Independence at\r\na fixed date, July 4, 1921. It ends the cruel uncertainty, so unjust\r\nto both the Filipinos and to the Americans in the Philippines, that\r\nis contained in the present program of indefinite retention with\r\nundeclared intention. Five years ago, in the North American Review\r\nfor January 18, and June 21, 1907, the writer hereof expressed the\r\nbelief that an earlier date was feasible, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n    If three strong and able men, familiar with insular conditions,\r\n    and still young enough to undertake the task [538] were told by\r\n    a President of the United States, by authority of the Congress,\r\n    \"Go out there and set up a respectable native government in\r\n    ten years, and then come away,\" they could and would do it,\r\n    and that government would be a success; and one of the greatest\r\n    moral victories in the annals of free government would have\r\n    been written by the gentlemen concerned upon the pages of their\r\n    country's history.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Jones's bill allows four years more of time, I believe it to\r\nbe absolutely safe.\r\n\r\nGovernor Curry, the Congressman from New Mexico hereinabove mentioned,\r\nwho spent eight years in the Philippines, agrees with the fundamental\r\nprinciple of the Jones bill, that as to making a definite promise of\r\nIndependence within a few years, and does not consider 1921 too early.\r\n\r\nUnder the present law, the Philippine Assembly has some eighty\r\nmembers, each supposed to represent 90,000 people, more or less. This\r\ntallies, roughly, with the census total of population, which is\r\n7,600,000. [539] Under the existing law in the Philippines, the\r\nqualifications for voting are really of two kinds, though nominally\r\nof three kinds. There is a property qualification, and there is\r\nan educational qualification. In any case, in order to vote, the\r\nindividual must be twenty-one years old, and must have lived for six\r\nmonths in the place where he offers to vote. The property qualification\r\nrequires that the would-be voter own at least $250 worth of property,\r\nor pay a tax to the amount of $15. The explanation of how a man may\r\nnot own $250 worth of property and yet pay $15 taxes is that under the\r\nold Spanish system, which we partially adopted, a man might pay such\r\ncedula or poll-tax as he preferred, according to a graduated scale,\r\ncertain civic rights being accorded to those voluntarily paying the\r\nhigher poll-tax which were denied to those paying less. The educational\r\nqualification requires the would-be voter to speak, read, and write\r\neither English or Spanish, or else to have held certain enumerated\r\nsmall municipal offices under the Spaniards--before the American\r\noccupation. Mr. Jones's bill proposes to add the speaking, reading,\r\nand writing of the native dialect of a given locality [540] to the\r\neducational qualification. This would double, or perhaps triple,\r\nthe electorate, and would, in my judgment, be wise. Thousands upon\r\nthousands of natives who only speak a little Spanish can both speak,\r\nread, and write their native Tagalo, Ilocano, or Visayan, as the\r\ncase may be. The total of those qualified to vote for members of the\r\nAssembly in 1907 was only about 100,000. At a later election, that\r\nnumber was doubled. If there are 7,500,000 people in the archipelago,\r\none fifth of these should represent the adult male population, say\r\n1,500,000. Under Mr. Jones's bill, the electorate would probably\r\nincrease to half a million long before the date he proposes for\r\nindependence, July 4, 1921. But all such details as qualification for\r\nvoting might, it seems to me, be left to people on the ground, their\r\nrecommendations controlling. Under a promise of independence by 1921,\r\na very fair electorate of at least one third, possibly one half, of\r\nthe adult male population, could be built up. As the majority report\r\non the Jones Bill, dated April 26, 1912, says:\r\n\r\n\r\n    For nearly ten years the average public-school enrolment has not\r\n    been less than 500,000. [541]\r\n\r\n\r\nI believe that the Moros should be left as they are for the\r\npresent. The time for solving that problem has not yet been\r\nreached. Mr. Jones himself evidently bases his idea of allowing the\r\nMoro country representation in the Philippine Congress, or legislature\r\nprovided by his bill, on the probability that enough Christian people\r\nwill vote, down there, to make up an electorate that would not be\r\n\"impossible,\" i.e., absurd. For instance, he tells me that a great\r\nmany people have moved into Mindanao from the northern islands for\r\ncommercial reasons, and, if I recollect correctly, that Zamboanga,\r\nthe most beautiful little port in Mindanao, which hardly had 10,000\r\npeople when I was there, now has possibly 50,000. But the Moro\r\nquestion need not stand in the way of setting up an independent\r\ngovernment in the Philippines in 1921, as proposed by his bill. You\r\nhave material for thirteen original states, representing a population\r\nof nearly seven million Christian people, in Luzon and the six main\r\nVisayan Islands. Why delay the creation of this republic on account\r\nof 250,000 semi-civilized, crudely Mohammedan Moros in Mindanao--a\r\nseparate island lying off to the south of the proposed republic? [542]\r\nA happy solution of the matter would be to send Mr. Jones out there as\r\nGovernor-General and let him work out the problem on the ground. He\r\nhas had a long and distinguished career in the public service,\r\ntwenty-two years in Congress. His public record and speeches on the\r\nPhilippine question from the beginning would make him to the Filipinos\r\nthe very incarnation of a bona fide intention on our part to give\r\nthem their independence at the earliest practical moment, that is,\r\nat some time which the living might hope to see. When Governor Taft\r\nand Mr. Root drew the Philippine Government Act of 1902, the former\r\nhad already been president of the Philippine Commission for two\r\nyears, had been all over the archipelago, and knew it well. Suppose\r\nthe Taft policy should be substituted by the more progressive Jones\r\npolicy. Mr. Jones, or whoever is to change the policy, ought to have\r\nas much acquaintance with the subject, acquired on the ground, as\r\nMr. Taft had when he formulated his policy of indefinite retention\r\nwith undeclared intention. The nucleus of the Taft policy was stated\r\nby Governor Taft to the Senate Committee in 1902, as follows [543]:\r\n\r\n\r\n    My own judgment is that the best policy, if a policy is to be\r\n    declared at all, is to declare the intention of the United States\r\n    to hold the islands indefinitely, until the people shall show\r\n    themselves fit for self-government, under a gradually increasing\r\n    popular government, when their relation to the United States,\r\n    either of statehood, or of quasi-independence, like the colony\r\n    of Australia or Canada, can be declared after mutual conference.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy which Mr. Jones has favored for the last twelve years is\r\nalmost as well known to the Filipinos as are the views of Mr. Taft\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the writer desires to say, with especial emphasis,\r\nthat the suggestions outlining the plan which forms the bulk of this\r\nchapter are presented in a spirit of entire deference to the views\r\nof any one else who may have considered this great subject carefully,\r\nespecially to the views of Mr. Jones, whose bill is so entirely right\r\nin principle. The one supreme need of the situation is a definite\r\nlegislative declaration which shall make clear to all concerned--to the\r\nFilipino demagogue and the American grafter, as well as to the great\r\nbody of the good people of both races out there--that the governing\r\nof a remote and alien people is to have no permanent place in the\r\npurposes of our national life; and that we do bona fide intend to\r\ngive the Filipinos their independence at a date in the future which\r\nwill interest the living, by extending to the living the hope to see\r\nthe independence of their country. And the Jones Bill does that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE WAY OUT\r\n\r\n                Respect for the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland\r\n                has now taken such lodgment in the conscience of\r\n                Europe that its violation would inevitably provoke\r\n                a storm of indignation.\r\n\r\n                             M. de Martens in the Revue des Deux Mondes.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 1912, Honorable W. A. Jones, of Virginia, Chairman of the\r\nHouse Committee on Insular Affairs, introduced a resolution (H. J. 278)\r\nproposing the neutralization of the Philippines, to accompany his\r\nPhilippine Independence Bill discussed in the preceding chapter. Such\r\na resolution, accompanying such a bill, both introduced by one of the\r\nmajority leaders in the House of Representatives, lifts the question\r\nof Philippine neutralization out of the region of the \"academic,\"\r\nand brings it forward as a thing which must, sooner or later, command\r\nthe serious consideration both of Congress and the country. There\r\nhave been many such resolutions before that of Mr. Jones. But they\r\nare all the same in principle. All contemplate our guaranteeing the\r\nFilipinos their independence until the treaties they propose shall\r\nbe consummated. In 1911, there were at least nine such resolutions\r\nproposing neutralization of the Philippines, introduced by the\r\nfollowing named gentlemen, the first a Republican, the rest Democrats:\r\n\r\nMr. McCall, of Massachusetts; Mr. Cline, of Indiana; Mr. Sabath,\r\nof Illinois; Mr. Garner, of Texas; Mr. Peters, of Massachusetts;\r\nMr. Martin, of Colorado; Mr. Burgess, of Texas; Mr. Oldfield, of\r\nArkansas; and Mr. Ferris, of Oklahoma.\r\n\r\nBecause the neutralization plan to provide against the Philippines\r\nbeing annexed by some other Power in case we ever give them their\r\nindependence would, if successfully worked out, reduce by that much\r\nthe possible area of war, and be a distinct step in the direction of\r\nuniversal peace, it is certainly worthy of careful consideration by\r\nthe enlightened judgment of the Congress and the world.\r\n\r\nMr. McCall is the father of the neutralization idea, so far as\r\nthe House of Representatives is concerned, application of it to\r\nthe Philippines having been first suggested at the Universal Peace\r\nConference of 1904, by Mr. Erving Winslow, of Boston. Mr. McCall has\r\nbeen introducing his neutralization resolution at every Congress for\r\na number of Congresses past.\r\n\r\nThe McCall Resolution (H. J. Res. 107) is the oldest, and perhaps the\r\nsimplest, of the various pending resolutions for the neutralization\r\nof the Philippines, and is typical of all. It reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n    JOINT RESOLUTION\r\n\r\n    Declaring the purpose of the United States to recognize\r\n    the independence of the Filipino people as soon as a stable\r\n    government can be established, and requesting the President to\r\n    open negotiations for the neutralization of the Philippine Islands.\r\n\r\n    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United\r\n    States of America in Congress assembled:\r\n\r\n    That in accordance with the principles upon which its government\r\n    is founded and which were again asserted by it at the outbreak of\r\n    the war with Spain, the United States declares that the Filipino\r\n    people of right ought to be free and independent, and announces\r\n    its purpose to recognize their independence as soon as a stable\r\n    government, republican in form, can be established by them, and\r\n    thereupon to transfer to such government all its rights in the\r\n    Philippine Islands upon terms which shall be reasonable and just,\r\n    and to leave the sovereignty and control of their country to the\r\n    Filipino people.\r\n\r\n    Resolved, That the President of the United States be, and he hereby\r\n    is, requested to open negotiations with such foreign Powers as in\r\n    his opinion should be parties to the compact for the neutralization\r\n    of the Philippine Islands by international agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the McCall Resolution, or any one of the kindred resolutions,\r\nwere passed, and complied with by the President of the United States,\r\nand accepted by the other Powers, and the Filipinos were helped to\r\norganize territorial governments such as Arizona and New Mexico were\r\nbefore they became States, several such territories could form the\r\nnucleus about which to begin to build at once, as indicated in the\r\nchapter on \"The Road to Autonomy.\" A number of such territories could\r\nbe made at once as completely autonomous as the governments of the\r\nterritories of Arizona and New Mexico were before their admission to\r\nour Union. With those examples to emulate, together with the tingling\r\nof the general blood that would follow a promise of independence and\r\na national life of their own, similar territorial governments could\r\nbe successively organized, as indicated in the preceding chapter,\r\nthroughout the archipelago. These could, in less than ten years, be\r\nfitted for admission to a federal union of autonomous territories,\r\nwith the string of our sovereignty still tied to it, and an American\r\nGovernor-General still over the whole, as now. And when the last island\r\nknocked for admission and was admitted, the string could be cut, and\r\nthe Federal Union of Territories admitted, through our good offices, to\r\nthe sisterhood of nations, as an independent Philippine republic. They\r\nwould not bother the rest of the world any more than Belgium and\r\nSwitzerland do, which are likewise protected by neutralization.\r\n\r\nThe idea of international neutralization is not without pride of\r\nancestry or hope of posterity. It was born out of the downfall of\r\nNapoleon I. The Treaty of Paris of 1815 declared that\r\n\r\n\r\n    the neutrality and inviolability of Switzerland, as well as its\r\n    independence of outside influences, are in conformity with the\r\n    true interests of European politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Congress of Vienna, held afterwards in the same year, at\r\nwhich there were present, besides the various monarchs, such men as\r\nWellington, Talleyrand, and Metternich, solemnly and finally reiterated\r\nthat declaration. Would not \"the neutrality and inviolability\" of\r\nthe Philippines be gladly acceded to by the great Powers as being\r\n\"in conformity with the true interests of European politics,\" and\r\nAsiatic politics as well?\r\n\r\nSays M. De Martens, in an article in the Revue des Deux Mondes for\r\nNovember 15, 1903:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Respect for the perpetual neutrality of Switzerland has now taken\r\n    such lodgment in the conscience of the civilized nations of Europe\r\n    that its violation would inevitably provoke a storm of indignation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt present, the Philippines are a potential apple of discord thrown\r\ninto the Balance of Power in the Pacific. The present policy of\r\nindefinite retention by us, with undeclared intention, leaves everybody\r\nguessing, including ourselves. Now is the accepted time, while the\r\nhorizon of the future is absolutely cloudless, to ask Japan to sign\r\na treaty agreeing not to annex the Philippine Islands after we give\r\nthem their independence. By her answer she will show her hand. The\r\novercrowded monarchies do not pretend any special scruples about\r\nannexing anything annexable. Germany very frankly insists that she\r\nbecame a great Power too late to get her rightful share of the earth's\r\nsurface, and that she must expand somewhither. And only the virile\r\nmenace of the Monroe Doctrine has so far stayed her heavy hand from\r\nseizing some portion of South America. But probably none of the Powers\r\nwould object to converting the Philippines into permanently neutral\r\nterritory, by the same kind of an agreement that protects Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of London of 1831, relative to Belgium and Holland,\r\ndeclares:\r\n\r\n\r\n    Within the limits indicated, Belgium shall form an independent\r\n    and perpetually neutral state. She shall be required to observe\r\n    this same neutrality toward all the other states.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe signatories to this treaty were Great Britain, France, Austria,\r\nPrussia, and Russia. Forty years after it was made, during the\r\nFranco-Prussian war, when Belgium's neutrality was threatened by\r\nmanifestations of intention on the part both of France and of Prussia\r\nto occupy some of her territory, England served notice on both parties\r\nto the conflict that if either violated the territorial integrity of\r\nBelgium, she, England, would join forces with the other. And the treaty\r\nwas observed. The specific way in which observance of it was compassed\r\nwas this: Great Britain made representations to both France and Germany\r\nwhich resulted in two identical conventions, signed in August, 1870,\r\nat Paris and Berlin, whereby any act of aggression by either against\r\nBelgium was to be followed by England's joining forces with the other\r\nagainst the aggressor. So long as human nature does not change very\r\nmaterially, \"the green-eyed monster\" will remain a powerful factor in\r\nhuman affairs. The mutual jealousy of the Powers will always be the\r\nsaving grace, in troubled times, of neutralization treaties signed in\r\ntime of profound peace. If \"Balance of Power\" considerations in Europe\r\nhave protected the Turkish Empire from annexation or dismemberment all\r\nthese years, without a neutralization treaty, why will not the mutual\r\njealousy of the Powers insure the signing and faithful observance of\r\na treaty tending to preserve the Balance of Power in the Pacific? Who\r\nwould object?\r\n\r\nThe Panama Canal is to be opened in 1913. We want South America to\r\nbe a real friend to the Monroe Doctrine, which she certainly is not\r\nenthusiastic about now, and will never be while we remain wedded\r\nto the McKinley Doctrine of Benevolent Assimilation of unconsenting\r\npeople--people anxious to develop, under God, along their own lines. In\r\n1906, while Secretary of State of the United States, Mr. Root made\r\na tour of South America. He told those people down there, at Rio\r\nJaneiro, by way of quieting their fears lest we may some day be moved\r\nto \"improve\" their condition also, through benevolent assimilation\r\nand vigorous application of the \"uplift\" treatment:\r\n\r\n\r\n    We wish for * * * no territory except our own. We deem the\r\n    independence and equal rights of the smallest and weakest member\r\n    of the family of nations entitled to as much respect as those of\r\n    the greatest empire, and we deem the observance of that respect the\r\n    chief guaranty of the weak against the oppression of the strong.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat Rio Janeiro speech of Mr. Root's is as noble a masterpiece of\r\nreal eloquence, its setting and all considered, as any utterance of\r\nany statesman of modern times. Among other things, he said:\r\n\r\n\r\n    No student of our times can fail to see that not America alone\r\n    but the whole civilized world is swinging away from its old\r\n    governmental moorings and intrusting the fate of its civilization\r\n    to the capacity of the popular mass to govern. By this pathway\r\n    mankind is to travel, whithersoever it leads. Upon the success\r\n    of this, our great undertaking, the hope of humanity depends.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Secretary of War, \"civilizing with a Krag,\" Mr. Root reminds one\r\nof Cortez and Pizarro. As Secretary of State, he permits us to believe\r\nthat all the great men are not dead yet.\r\n\r\nIf, in making that Rio Janeiro speech, Mr. Root laid to his soul\r\nthe flattering unction that the minds of his hearers did not revert\r\ndubiously to his previous grim missionary work in the Philippines,\r\nwhere the percentage of literacy is superior to that of more than one\r\nLatin-American republic, he is very much mistaken. If he is laboring\r\nunder any such delusion, let him read a book written since then by\r\na distinguished South American publicist, called El Porvenir de La\r\nAmericana Latina (\"The Future of Latin America\"). If he does not read\r\nSpanish, he can divine the contents of the book from the cartoon which\r\nadorns the title-page. The cartoon represents the American eagle,\r\nflag in claw, standing on the map of North America, looking toward\r\nSouth America as if ready for flight, its beak bent over Panama,\r\nthe shadow of its wings already darkening the northern portions of\r\nthe sister continent to the south of us. To get the trade of South\r\nAmerica, in the mighty struggle for commercial supremacy which is to\r\nfollow the opening of the Panama Canal, we must win the confidence of\r\nSouth America. We will never do it until we do the right thing by the\r\nFilipinos. Concerning the Philippines, South America reflects that\r\nwe annexed the first supposedly rich non-contiguous Spanish country\r\nwe ever had a chance to annex that we had not previously solemnly\r\nvowed we would not annex. We must choose between the Monroe Doctrine\r\nof mutually respectful Fraternal Relation, which contemplates some\r\ntwenty-one mutually trustful republics in the Western Hemisphere, all\r\na unit against alien colonization here, and the McKinley Doctrine of\r\ngrossly patronizing Benevolent Assimilation, which contemplates some\r\n8,000,000 of people in the Eastern Hemisphere, all a unit against\r\nalien colonization there--a people, moreover, whose friendship we\r\nhave cultivated with the Gatling gun and the gallows, and watered\r\nwith tariff and other legislation enacted without knowledge and used\r\nwithout shame.\r\n\r\nWe should stop running a kindergarten for adults in Asia, and get back\r\nto the Monroe Doctrine. There are only two hemispheres to a sphere,\r\nand our manifest destiny lies in the Western one. We do not want the\r\nearth. Our mission as a nation is to conserve the republican form\r\nof government, and the consent-of-the-governed principle, and to\r\npromote the general peace of mankind by insuring it in our half of\r\nthe earth. The first thing to do to set this country right again is\r\nto get rid of the Philippines, and give them a square deal, pursuant\r\nto the spirit of the neutralization resolutions now pending before\r\nCongress. All these resolutions contain the one supreme need of the\r\nhour, an honest declaration of intention. The longer we fight shy\r\nof that, the less likely we are ever to give the Filipinos their\r\nindependence, and the deeper we get into the mire of mistaken\r\nphilanthropy and covert exploitation.\r\n\r\nWe should resume our original programme of blazing out the path and\r\nmaking clear the way up which any nation of the earth may follow when\r\nit will. That path lies along the line of actually attempting as a\r\nnation a practical demonstration of the Power of Righteousness, or,\r\nin other words, the existence of an Omnipotent Omniscient Benevolent\r\nGood (whether you spell it with one o or with two is not important)\r\nshaping, guiding, and directing human affairs, such demonstration\r\nto be made through the concerted action of a self-governing people\r\nunder a written Constitution based on equality of opportunity and\r\nthe Golden Rule.\r\n\r\nAs a people we are very young yet. It is not yet written in the Book\r\nof Time how long this nation will survive. So far, our government is\r\nonly an experiment. But, as John Quincy Adams once said, it and its\r\nConstitution are \"an experiment upon the human heart,\" to see whether\r\nor not the Golden Rule will work in government among men.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The date contemplated by the pending Philippine Independence\r\nBill, introduced in the House of Representatives in March, 1912,\r\nby Hon.

How modest and self-effacing. How deep his insight\r\ninto the human heart. How swift the intuitions of his sympathy. How\r\ncompelling the charm of his gracious presence.

Under the Act of March 2, 1899, providing the\r\nvolunteer army of 35,000 men for the Philippines, twenty-four regiments\r\nof infantry and one of cavalry were organized. The infantry regiments\r\nwere numbered Twenty-six to Forty-nine, both inclusive, the numbering\r\ntaking up where the numbering of the regular infantry regiments then\r\nended, with the Twenty-fifth. The cavalry regiment was called the\r\nEleventh Cavalry, the regular cavalry regimental enumeration ending at\r\nthat time with the Tenth. The Eleventh Cavalry and the Thirty-sixth\r\nInfantry were organized, officered, and largely recruited from men\r\nof the State Volunteers sent out in '98, who, in consideration of\r\nliberal inducements offered by the Government, consented to remain.\r\n\r\n[235] The population of the city of Manila according to the Philippine\r\nCensus of 1903, vol. ii., p. 16; was 219,928. The three next largest\r\ntowns are: Laoag, in the province of Ilocos Norte, about 270 miles\r\nnorth of Manila, near the northwest corner of Luzon, population 19,699;\r\nIloilo, capital of the island of Panay and chief city and port of the\r\nVisayan Islands, some 300 miles south of Manila, population 19,054;\r\nand Cebu, capital and chief port of the island of Cebu, a day's\r\nvoyage from Iloilo, population 18,330. See Philippine Census of 1903,\r\nvol. ii., p. 38.\r\n\r\n[236] 115,026 is the exact figure.

The civilized Christian\r\nFilipinos of Mindanao live mostly on the littoral.\r\n\r\n[248] This was said in no mere speech. Speeches are often\r\nmisquoted. It was a letter signed by the foremost man of this age,\r\nMr. Roosevelt, written September 15, 1900, accepting the nomination\r\nfor the Vice-Presidency. (See Proceedings of the Republican National\r\nCommittee, 1900, p. 86.) Yet it represented then one of the many\r\ncurrent misapprehensions about the Filipinos which moved this great\r\nnation to destroy a young republic set up in a spirit of intelligent\r\nand generous emulation of our own.\r\n\r\n[249] One of the sultans, or head-men, was believed in 1899, to have\r\ntried on his return from a pilgrimage to Mecca made before we took\r\nthe Philippines, by some dickering at Singapore or near there in\r\nthe Straits Settlements, to sell out for a consideration to Great\r\nBritain, so as to be under the protection and in the pay of British\r\nNorth Borneo.\r\n\r\n[250] The fraction used is based on 500,000 (the population of\r\nMindanao), being that fraction of 7,500,000 (which last is, roughly\r\nspeaking, the total population of the archipelago). The census figures\r\nbeing 499,634 and 7,635,426 respectively, as heretofore stated.\r\n\r\n[251] 7,635,426. Philippine Census, vol. ii., p. 15.\r\n\r\n[252] 3,798,507.

New\r\nJersey's area is nearer 8000 than 7000 square miles. For further\r\nillustration by comparison, it may be noted in this connection that\r\nthe area of Massachusetts is over 8000 square miles (8315) and that of\r\nVermont between 9000 and 10,000 (9565). As Costa Rica has only 368,780\r\ninhabitants (Statesman's Year Book), the province of Pangasinan alone\r\ncontains more people than the republic of Costa Rica. The average of\r\nintelligence and industry of the masses in both is doubtless about\r\nthe same, with the probabilities in favor of Pangasinan.\r\n\r\n[258] Table of Areas, Philippine Census of 1903, vol. i., p. 58.\r\n\r\n[259] Table of Populations, ib., vol. ii., p. 123.\r\n\r\n[260] In alluding, in complimentary terms, to this officer's\r\ngallant conduct on that occasion, Harper's History of the War in the\r\nPhilippines spells the name \"Hustin,\" as it had previously misspelled\r\nthe name of the star actor among the younger officers who participated\r\nin the Zapote River fight \"Kanly.\" \"Such is fame.\" The gentleman's\r\nright name is Mustin. He is now a lieutenant-commander, well known\r\nin the navy to-day, as the inventor of the \"Mustin gun-sight.\"\r\n\r\n[261] There is a notable unanimity, among the men in the army of about\r\nMajor March's age and rank, in the opinion that he is a man of very\r\nextraordinary ability. This unanimity is so generous and genuine that\r\nI deem it a duty as well as a pleasure to emphasize it here.\r\n\r\n[262] See Otis's Report covering September 1, 1899, to May 5, 1900,\r\nWar Dept.

(1902), p. 1988. It was in this\r\nAringay fight that one of the narrowest escapes from death in battle\r\never officially authenticated occurred. Lieutenant Dennis P. Quinlan,\r\nnow a captain of the 5th U. S. Cavalry, was struck just over the heart\r\nby an insurgent bullet (probably more or less spent) while crossing the\r\nriver in the face of a hot fire, the bullet being deflected by a plug\r\nof tobacco carried in the breast pocket of the regulation campaign\r\nblue shirt he was wearing, which pocket, any one acquainted with\r\nthat shirt will remember, is at the left breast just over the heart\r\n(War Department Report, 1900, vol. i., pt. 6, pp. 166, 279). He was\r\nknocked over, but soon recovered and went on. The flesh of the left\r\nbreast over the heart was bruised black and blue. He was recommended\r\nfor a medal of honor on account of the incident (War Department Report,\r\n1900, vol. i., pt. 7, p. 136).\r\n\r\n[271] If these figures are not exact, they are approximately\r\ncorrect. We always called it three hundred miles from Manila to the\r\nnorthern end of Luzon via Vigan and the lighthouse at Cape Bojeador.\r\n\r\n[272] For instance, there was what used to be known to the 8th Corps\r\nas \"Col. Jim Parker's night attack at Vigan,\" which occurred early in\r\nDecember, 1899, soon after that place was occupied, the insurgents\r\ncoming into the town in large numbers, at night under command of\r\nGeneral Tinio, through a tunnel so it was said, and being driven\r\nout only after desperate close quarters' fighting from about two\r\no'clock in the morning until after broad daylight, leaving the streets\r\nand plaza of Vigan much cumbered with their dead. Again, later on,\r\nthere was the sudden order, swiftly executed, in obedience to which\r\nLieutenant Grayson V. Heidt with a part of a troop of the 3d Cavalry,\r\nrode from Laoag to Batac to the rescue of a besieged garrison at the\r\nlatter place, arriving in time to prevent a small Custer massacre,\r\nthe garrison having gotten short of ammunition, and having just managed\r\nto telegraph for reinforcements a few moments before the enemy cut the\r\ntelegraph wire. Then, there was Lieutenant Hannay, of the 22d Infantry,\r\nwho being at the front, received an order from General Lawton to come\r\nback to build a bridge. The order made him sick, the surgeon reported\r\nhim sick, the messenger returned with that message, and then Hannay\r\npromptly got well, and stayed at the front. And so on, ad infinitum.\r\n\r\n[273] The Visayan Islands--the half-dozen islands between Luzon and\r\nMindanao already mentioned, as the only ones worth mentioning for\r\nour purposes, together with the various smaller islands, islets,\r\nand rocks \"visible at high water.\"\r\n\r\n[274] \"During April, in the First District, comprising the provinces\r\nof Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur, Union, Abra, Lepanto, Benguet, and Bontoc,\r\nBrigadier General S.

Captain Batchelor had neither orders nor\r\npermission to do what he did. When he cut loose from the command he\r\nbelonged to, he took very long chances on finding subsistence for\r\nhis men in the unknown country he had set out to conquer, to say\r\nnothing of the highly probable chances of annihilation of his whole\r\ncommand. When an officer commanding troops does this in time of war,\r\nhe does so at his peril, and signal success is his only salvation.\r\n\r\n[282] Area tables, Philippine Census, vol. i., p. 58.\r\n\r\n[283] Population tables, Philippine Census, vol. ii., p. 123.\r\n\r\n[284] Though Nueva Vizcaya is not in the Cagayan valley, but on a\r\nplateau of the great divide, still, its streams all flow into the\r\nCagayan valley, and that term will be used in this book, as it is\r\ncolloquially in the Philippines, to include not only the Cagayan valley\r\nproper, but also the adjoining tributary province of Nueva Vizcaya.\r\n\r\n[285] The only thing of interest to the American people that ever\r\nhappened over there was the capture of Lieutenant Gilmore of the Navy,\r\nand his men, at Baler, on the Pacific coast, in Principe, a capture\r\nwhich, it will be recollected, was followed by long captivity, and\r\nultimately terminated in rescue. The interested student will see\r\nthese two provinces on the American maps of the islands, but they\r\nwere each attached by the Taft government for administration purposes\r\nto another province, and do not appear in the American census list\r\nof provinces. Therefore, they cut no figure in the census totals,\r\neither of area or population.\r\n\r\n[286] The officer on whom public attention in the United States was\r\nlater focussed by an alleged order, charged to have been issued by him\r\nin a campaign in Samar to \"kill everything over ten years old.\" This\r\nalleged order was called by the American newspapers of the period\r\n\"Jake Smith's Kill and Burn Order.\"\r\n\r\n[287] The figures as to Principe are mere arbitrary guesses, the exact\r\nfigures used being fixed on merely to get convenient round numbers,\r\nthere being no statistics as to Principe.\r\n\r\n[288] Of course the Filipinos should be consulted as to what provinces\r\nshould constitute each state, but I am simply sketching a tentative\r\ngovernmental scheme based upon the way our army perfected its original\r\ngrip on public order and the general administrative situation.\r\n\r\n[289] All along here we, of course, deal in round numbers only.\r\n\r\n[290] See War Department Report, 1900, vol. i., part 5, pp. 45 et\r\nseq.

Philippine Commission, passed June 11, 1901.\r\n\r\n[426] Act 1024, Philippine Commission, passed Oct. 10, 1903.\r\n\r\n[427] There were five members of the original Taft Commission,\r\nincluding President Taft.\r\n\r\n[428] I neither forget nor gainsay the generally benevolent character\r\nof his despotism; and having been a beneficiary of it myself I am\r\ntherefore disposed to see much of wisdom in the way it was exercised.\r\n\r\n[429] Philippine Census, vol. ii., p. 123.\r\n\r\n[430] Ib., vol. i., p. 58.\r\n\r\n[431] Says Brigadier-General Wm. H. Carter, in his annual report for\r\n1905 covering the Samar outbreak of 1904-5: \"Whatever may have been\r\nthe original cause of the outbreak, it was soon lost sight of when\r\nsuccess had drawn a large proportion of the people away from their\r\nhomes and fields. Except in the largest towns it became simply a\r\nquestion of joining the pulajans or being harried by them. In the\r\nabsence of proper protection thousands joined in the movement.\" See\r\nWar Department Report, 1905, vol. iii., p. 286.\r\n\r\n[432] Bulao was situated on a high bluff on the left bank of a river\r\ncalled the Bangahon. The Pulajans entered before daybreak, on July\r\n21st. There was a stiff fight at Bulao, also, between our native\r\ntroops and the enemy on August 21st, but Calderon seems to have\r\nleft it out of his list. See Gen. Wm. H. Carter's Report for 1905,\r\nWar Department Report, 1905, vol. iii., p. 290. Capt. Cary Crockett,\r\na descendant of David Crockett, commanded the constabulary, and though\r\nbadly wounded himself, as were also half his command, he defeated\r\na force of Pulajans greatly outnumbering his, killing forty-one of\r\nthem. Report U. S. Philippine Commission, 1905, pt. 3, p. 90, Report\r\nof Col. Wallace C. Taylor. I think he was awarded a medal of honor\r\nfor his work. He certainly earned it.\r\n\r\n\"Pulajan\" means \"red breeches,\" the uniform of the mountain clans,\r\nworn whenever they set out to give trouble.\r\n\r\n[433] Of March 23d of the previous year, already described in a\r\nprevious chapter, where Luther S. Kelly--\"Yellowstone\" Kelly--saved\r\nthe American women by gathering them and a few men in the Government\r\nHouse and bluffing the brigands off.\r\n\r\n[434] The \"Conant\" peso, named for the noted fiscal expert,\r\nMr. Conant. It was worth fifty cents American money.\r\n\r\n[435] The Fourteenth U. S. Infantry was stationed in garrison just\r\noutside the town proper of Calbayog, which was three hours by steam\r\nlaunch from the provincial capital, Catbalogan. But the depredations\r\nmight have been carried to just outside the line of the military\r\nreservation, and the military folk would not have dared to make a\r\nmove save on request first made by the Civil Government at Manila. In\r\nother words the above three villages were burned under their noses.\r\n\r\n[436] One seems to get the stoicism better in the original, somehow,\r\nso I give the body of the original Spanish, as it came to me:\r\n\r\n\r\n    En el distrito de Motiong, municipio de Wright, provincia de\r\n    Samar, Islas Filipinas, a primero de septiembre de mil novecientos\r\n    quatro.

It had been the cause of many\r\nof the 120 deaths in the Albay jail during the Ola insurrection. Ideal\r\nconditions for it are a steady diet of poor rice and lack of exercise.\r\n\r\n[441] It was not well to be too hasty. You might have the head of the\r\nwhole uprising in custody, or one of his most important lieutenants,\r\nand find it out by the merest accident in the course of hearing a\r\ncase against some apparently abject \"private of the rear rank.\"\r\n\r\n[442] By unwarranted I mean without warrant.

I regret extremely that your ill-health has made\r\n    this course imperative. Under all the circumstances, however, I am\r\n    satisfied that you have acted wisely, as I have feared for some\r\n    time that you would be unable to perform the duties pertaining\r\n    to your office because of your physical condition. I, therefore,\r\n    though with much regret accept your resignation.\r\n\r\n    At the same time I beg to express my appreciation of the faithful\r\n    and efficient services you have rendered in the past. I hope very\r\n    much that a rest and change of climate may have the effect of\r\n    restoring you again to vigorous health, and I assure you that\r\n    you carry with you my best wishes for your future prosperity\r\n    and happiness.\r\n\r\n        Sincerely yours,\r\n        Luke E.

Carson, of the Philippine Supreme Court, who has been a member\r\nof the Philippine Judiciary since the Taft Civil Government was\r\nfounded in 1901. If this book has gained for me any character in\r\nthe estimation of any reader who is or may hereafter be clothed with\r\nauthority, I desire to say here, on the very highest public grounds,\r\nthat, in my judgment, Judge Carson is the most considerable man we\r\nhave out there now (1912)--a good man to have in an emergency. Though\r\nnot as learned in the law as his colleague, Justice Johnson--who is\r\nquite the equal, as a jurist, of most of the Federal judges I know\r\nin the United States, Judge Carson is a man of great breadth of view,\r\nand is peculiarly endowed with capacity to handle men and situations\r\neffectively and patriotically.\r\n\r\n[539] Says the census of the Philippines of 1903, vol. ii., p. 15:\r\n\"The total population of the Philippine Archipelago on March 2,\r\n1903, was 7,635,426. Of this number, 6,987,686 enjoyed a considerable\r\ndegree of civilization, while the remainder, 647,740, consisted of wild\r\npeople.\" By this same Census, the Moros are classified as uncivilized,\r\nand the population of the island on which they live, Mindanao, is\r\ngiven at about 500,000 (499,634, vol. ii., p. 126), of which about\r\nhalf only (252,940) are Moros, the rest being civilized. The total of\r\nthe uncivilized people of the archipelago, according to the Census, is\r\n647,740 (vol. ii., p. 123), less than 400,000, leaving out the Moros.\r\n\r\n[540] Tagalo, Ilocano, and Visayan are the three main dialects\r\nthat have been evolved into written language by the patience of the\r\nSpanish priests in the last couple of hundred years or so. Probably\r\nfive sixths of the people of the archipelago speak some one of these\r\nthree dialects. In fact they can hardly be called \"dialects,\" for there\r\nare plenty of books--novels, plays, grammars, histories, dictionaries,\r\netc.--written in Tagalo, Ilocano, or Visayan. Every educated Filipino\r\nof the well-to-do classes grows up speaking Spanish and the dialect\r\nof his native province, while the latter is the only language spoken\r\nby the less fortunate people of his neighborhood, the poorer classes.\r\n\r\n[541] This report is numbered Report 606, 62d Cong., 2d Sess., and\r\naccompanies H. R. 22143 (the Jones Bill).\r\n\r\n[542] According to the American Census of the Philippines, of 1903,\r\nthe total population of Mindanao is 499,634 (see vol. ii., p. 126),\r\nof which 252,940 are Moros, and the rest civilized. In addition to\r\nsaid 252,940 Moros on Mindanao, the adjacent islets contain some\r\n25,000 Moros.\r\n\r\n[543] See Senate Document 331, 1902, p. 339.",
