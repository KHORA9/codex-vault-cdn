The long\r\ncontinuance of this dual power; its control of the city, infrequently\r\ninterrupted, throughout the century; the nature of its principles, the\r\nmethod of its practices and the character of its personnel--all these\r\ncombine to furnish a spectacle which exerts over the general mind a\r\npeculiar and strong fascination.\r\n\r\nIt was under the sway of this mood that I began the investigation which\r\nhas resulted in this volume. I had no thought, on beginning, to carry\r\nthe work so far: I sought merely to satisfy my curiosity regarding the\r\nmore important particulars of Tammany’s history. But I soon learned\r\nthat what I sought was not easily to be obtained. The few narratives\r\nalready published were generally found to be either extravagant\r\npanegyrics, printed under the patronage of the Tammany Society, or else\r\npartisan attacks, violent in style and untruthful in statement. Usually\r\nboth were characterized by their paucity of real information no less\r\nthan by the number of their palpable errors of fact.\r\n\r\nTurning from these, I determined to find the facts for myself.\r\nMy search led me first through the files of all the available\r\nnewspapers from 1789 to the present time, and thence--for origins and\r\ncontributory causes--through publications as far back as 1788; thence\r\nthrough State and city histories, and a great number of biographies,\r\nsketches, essays, political pamphlets and broadsides. The fragmentary\r\nmatter gleaned from these sources was found to be extremely valuable\r\nin helping to form the continuous thread of a narrative, and in\r\ndetermining contemporary spirit; but the statements and conclusions,\r\nparticularly with regard to the character and conduct of public men,\r\nwere generally contradictory and inconclusive. Realizing this, I began\r\nthe last phase of my search--a task that has led me through numberless\r\ndreary pages of the Minutes and Documents of the Common Council (which\r\nfor the years previous to 1881 exist only in manuscript), Journals and\r\nDocuments of the Senate and Assembly, including the reports of various\r\nlegislative committees; Congressional and Executive Records, Treasury\r\nReports, Records of the Police, Common Pleas, Superior and Supreme\r\nCourts; Minutes of the Oyer and Terminer; Grand Jury Presentments,\r\nand Records of the Board of Supervisors. Finally, I have had the good\r\nfortune, in developing the story of the middle and later periods,\r\nof having secured many valuable interviews with a number of men who\r\nactively participated in the stirring events of thirty, forty and even\r\nfifty years ago.\r\n\r\nThe purpose to write a book became fixed as my search progressed. The\r\nwork is finished, and the result is now to be given to the public. What\r\nI have sought to produce is a narrative history--plain, compact and\r\nimpartial. I have sought to avoid an indulgence, on the one hand, in\r\npolitical speculation, and on the other, in moralizing platitudes. Such\r\ndeductions and generalizations as from time to time I have made, seem\r\nto me necessary in elucidating the narrative; without them the story\r\nwould prove to the reader a mere chronology of unrelated facts.\r\n\r\nIf my narrative furnishes a sad story for the leaders and chieftains\r\nof the Tammany Society and the Tammany Hall political organization,\r\nthe fault is not mine, but that of a multitude of incontestible public\r\nrecords. It was in no partizan spirit that I began the work, and in\r\nnone that I now conclude it. I have always been an independent in\r\npolitics; and I have even voted, when there seemed to me ample reason\r\nfor doing so, a Tammany ticket. I have tried to set down nothing in\r\nmalice, nor with such exceptions as are obviously necessary with\r\nregard to living men, to extenuate anything whatever. Those who may be\r\ntempted to consider my work partial and partizan, on account of the\r\nshowing that it makes of Tammany corruption and inefficiency, will do\r\nwell to read carefully the pages relating to the Whigs and to some\r\nother opponents of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe records show that a succession of prominent Tammany leaders were\r\ninvolved in some theft or swindle, public or private. These peculations\r\nor frauds ranged, in point of time, from 1799 and 1805-6 to the later\r\ndecades; in the matter of persons, from the founder of the Tammany\r\nSociety to some of the subsequent “bosses,” and in gradation of amount,\r\nfrom the petty thousands taken by Mooney, Stagg and Page, in the first\r\ndecade of the century, to the $1,220,000 taken by Swartwout in 1830-38\r\nand the undetermined millions taken by Wood and Tweed in the fifties,\r\nsixties and first two years of the seventies. From nearly the beginning\r\nof its active political career, Tammany leaders, with generally brief\r\ninterruptions, thus continued to abstract money from the city, the\r\nState and the nation--the interruptions to the practice generally\r\ncoinciding with the periods when Tammany in those years was deprived of\r\npolitical power.\r\n\r\nMy search has shown me the absurdity of the pretense that any vital\r\ndistinction exists between the Tammany Society and the Tammany Hall\r\npolitical organization. Tammany members industriously propagate this\r\npretense, but it has neither a historic nor an actual basis. From\r\n1805, the date of the apparent separation of the organization from\r\nthe society, the Sachems of the latter have ruled the policies of\r\nthe former. Repeatedly, as in 1828, 1838, 1853, and 1857, they have\r\ndetermined the “regularity” of contending factions in the organization,\r\nand have shut the hall to members of the faction against which they\r\nhave decided. The Sachems have at all times been the leaders in the\r\npolitical body, and the control of the society in every year that\r\nTammany has held control of the city, has determined the division of\r\nplunder for the ensuing year. The Tammany Society and the Tammany\r\npolitical organization constitute a dual power--but, unlike Ormuzd and\r\nAhrimanes, a duality working by identical means for an identical end.\r\n\r\nThe records show that Tammany was thus, from the beginning, an evil\r\nforce in politics. Its characteristics were formed by its first great\r\nleader, Aaron Burr, and his chief lieutenant, Matthew L. Davis; and\r\nwhatever is distinctive of Tammany methods and policies in 1900 is,\r\nfor the most part, but the development of features initiated by these\r\ntwo men one hundred years ago. It is curious to recall, on looking\r\nback to the time when my researches began, the abundant evidences of\r\nmisapprehension regarding Tammany’s earlier history. “No especial\r\ndiscredit attached to Tammany Hall before Tweed’s time,” wrote, in\r\neffect, Mr. E. L. Godkin in an essay published a few years ago. State\r\nSenator Fassett, in 1890, made a similar statement in his report on\r\nthe investigation of conditions in New York City. “Down to the time,”\r\nhe says, “that the Tammany ‘ring,’ under the leadership of William\r\nM. Tweed, took possession of the government of New York City … the\r\noffice [of Alderman] was held in credit and esteem.” The exact reverse\r\nof both statements is true; and abundant proof of my contention, I\r\nbelieve, will be found in the pages of this book. Another instance may\r\nbe given--though the opinion expressed, instead of being founded upon\r\nmisapprehension, may charitably be set down as one of misjudgment. “I\r\nwas a Sachem of Tammany,” said a one-time noted politician recently,\r\nbefore the Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents, “in\r\nthe days when it was _an honor to be a Sachem_.” The precise time he\r\ndid not specify; and it would be difficult to identify it from the\r\ndescription he has given. Certainly, since 1805, the office of Sachem\r\nhas been one ill calculated, of itself, to bring particular honor to\r\nthe incumbent.\r\n\r\nIt would be dishonest to pretend for a moment that Tammany has been\r\nalone in its evil-doing; it has been simply the most ingenious and the\r\nmost pretentious; and its practices have a historic continuity and\r\npersistence not shared by any of its rivals. The Whigs, for instance,\r\nsought in every possible way to outdo Tammany in election frauds; they\r\nstuffed ballot boxes, colonized voters, employed rowdies and thugs at\r\nthe polls and distributed thousands of deceptive ballots for the use\r\nof their opponents. In fiscal frauds, likewise, they left a record\r\nwell-nigh equaling that of Tammany. The Native Americans imitated\r\nboth Whigs and Tammany men, and the Republicans have given instances\r\nat Albany of a wholesale venality unapproached in the history of\r\nlegislative bodies. Among the few exceptions, during the earlier half\r\nof the century, to the general prostitution of civic ideals, was the\r\ncareer of the Workingmen’s party (1829-31) and of its successor, the\r\nEqual Rights party (1834-38). The principles of both these parties were\r\nfar in advance of their time; and though the effect tended somewhat to\r\nthe temporary heightening of political standards, a reaction followed,\r\nwhich again brought in a long period of fraud and corruption.\r\n\r\nBut shameful as this record is, it is one which, viewed in the light\r\nof present practises and present ideals, gives the basis for a robust\r\nfaith in the future. The hiding of vice and the employment of indirect\r\nmethods in cheating and plundering, are themselves an evidence of the\r\nexistence of moral standards; and it is unquestionable that Tammany\r\nto-day outwardly conforms to ethical demands which would have been\r\nscoffed at a half century ago. No one can read the details of political\r\nhistory without acknowledging a growing betterment in political methods.\r\n\r\n“Hardly a man [before the Civil War] could be found,” says Jesse Macy\r\nin his recent _History of Political Parties in the United States_,\r\n“who felt himself too virtuous to go into politics. The sensitively\r\nmoral were not repelled by political methods which to-day are regarded\r\nas disgraceful.” And further along he says: “It is easy to forget\r\nthat, from the very nature of moral progress, it often happens that\r\nintelligent moral leaders of one generation will in all good conscience\r\nsay and do things which only the conscious hypocrite or the knave of a\r\nlater generation can do.” Pessimism as to political progress secures no\r\nsupport from real research.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, and with some show of reason, how it has been possible\r\nfor New York City to achieve its present rank in population, in wealth,\r\nin commerce and in transportation facilities; how it has acquired\r\nits splendid libraries, its magnificent buildings, its museums, its\r\nparks, its benevolent institutions, in the face of this continued\r\ndominancy of corruption, violence and fraud. The answer is simple: the\r\ncity has grown _despite_ these adverse influences. The harbor of New\r\nYork is one factor; the Erie Canal (constructed notwithstanding the\r\nopposition of the dominant political party of the city) is another; the\r\ntremendous growth of the nation, and the thousand external influences\r\nthat determined the location of the nation’s metropolis, are yet other\r\nfactors. The city has grown to magnificence and world-wide influence;\r\nbut it has paid dear tribute for every forward step it has taken.\r\nImagination fails at picturing the metropolis that might have been,\r\ncould the city throughout the century have been guided and controlled\r\nin the light of present-day civic ideals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of securing the publication of this work by any\r\nof the regular publishing houses proved insurmountable. Two of the\r\nbest known firms wrote that they could not encourage me to submit\r\nthe manuscript to them for consideration. Four others considered its\r\npublication “inadvisable,” though their readers had returned favorable\r\nrecommendations. One other declined it without giving reasons. More\r\nrecently, when the offer of certain responsible persons who had\r\nread the manuscript, to guarantee the expense of its publication,\r\nwas made to a certain house, the firm replied: “… we should hardly\r\nfeel warranted in locking horns with Tammany Hall.…” It was thought\r\nthat perhaps an out-of-town house might issue it, but here again\r\ndeclinations were forthcoming. Finally it was decided to attempt\r\nits publication by private subscription. To this end I solicited\r\nindividual advances to a publication fund, from a number of the city’s\r\npublic-spirited citizens. The appearance of the work at this time is\r\ndue to the kindly interests of these men.\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments for the courtesies tendered me, and for material aid\r\nrendered in the project of issuing the work, are due to a number\r\nof persons: To the public-spirited citizens of different political\r\nfaiths, who, while familiar with the scope of the work, contributed the\r\nfunds for its publication without insisting upon a censorship of the\r\nmanuscript or its alteration in any way for political purposes; and\r\nparticularly to Mr. James B. Reynolds, Mr. James W. Pryor and Milo R.\r\nMaltbie, Ph. D.\r\n\r\n                                                        GUSTAVUS MYERS.\r\n\r\nNew York City, January, 1901.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD TO THE NEW EDITION (1917)\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the original publication of this work, a large number of\r\ninquiries have appeared in the _Publisher’s Weekly_ and have come\r\nfrom other quarters requesting information as to where copies of The\r\n_History of Tammany Hall_ could be obtained. For the last ten years\r\nthis work has been in continuous demand but unavailable. For reasons\r\nfully set forth in the preface to that issue, the edition of 1901 was\r\nbrought out in the face of difficulties. Not the least of these was\r\nthe self-expressed dread of certain publishing houses to bring out\r\na work which (as some of them frankly admitted in their letters of\r\ndeclination) might bring reprisals to them in some unexplained form or\r\nother.\r\n\r\nHence to all intents and purposes, that edition was in the nature of a\r\nrestricted private edition. Denied the usual and almost indispensable\r\npublication and distribution facilities by the publishing houses, the\r\nwork necessarily was subject to obvious disadvantages, and, so far as\r\ncirculation went, practically took rank as a suppressed book--not, it\r\nis true, suppressed by any particular agency, but by the circumstances\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\nIn 1913 Mr. Edward Kellogg Baird, a public-spirited attorney in New\r\nYork City, kindly undertook, in behalf of the author (who was absent in\r\nanother country at the time) to see whether some one of the publishing\r\nhouses would not bring out a new edition of _The History of Tammany\r\nHall_, brought down to date. In his letters to these publishers,\r\nMr. Baird pointed out that there never had been any lack of general\r\ninterest in this work, and referred to the extremely large number of\r\nreviews in important publications in many countries treating the book\r\nat length and commending its purpose and scope. Mr. Baird also called\r\nthe attention of publishers to the fact that the book was recognized\r\nas the only authority on the subject; that it had been tested by\r\ntime; that there had never been a libel suit arising from any of the\r\nstatements made therein; and that, therefore, there could be no valid\r\nobjection on the part of any publisher that publication of further\r\neditions would lead to any legal trouble.\r\n\r\nWith such possible objections thus disposed of in advance, Mr.\r\nBaird confidently expected that he would find at least one of\r\nthe old-established publishers who would not be deterred by such\r\nconsiderations as influenced them to refuse publication in 1901. But\r\nthe replies were virtually repetitions of those received twelve years\r\npreviously. One of the first replies, dated February 24, 1913, from the\r\nsenior member of a New York publishing house, read as follows:\r\n\r\n“For the very same reason that the author of _The History of Tammany\r\nHall_ was unable to obtain a publisher for the original edition,\r\nleads us to decide unfavorably so far as we are concerned. The policy\r\nof publishing the book was the first question raised by one of my\r\npartners, before he had a chance even to read the preface, and we as\r\na firm have decided that the objection is too strong to permit us to\r\nbring the book out over our imprint. I am sorry that we must be so\r\ncowardly, for the book itself is worthy of reissue, and I personally\r\nshould be glad to see it published by my firm.…”\r\n\r\nAt about the same time, the head of another prominent and older New\r\nYork publishing house--a citizen, by the way, who had served as foreman\r\nof a noted grand jury exposing Tammany corruption--wrote this reply:\r\n\r\n“I have given due consideration, with my partners, to the suggestion\r\nyou are so kind to submit to us in regard to the publication of a new\r\nedition of _The History of Tammany Hall_ brought down to date.… I must\r\nreport that our judgment is adverse to the desirability of reissuing\r\nsuch a book with the imprint of our house. I should be individually\r\ninterested in obtaining a copy for my own library in case you may be\r\nable to secure for the work a satisfactory arrangement with some other\r\nhouse.”\r\n\r\nAn equally well-known New York publishing house sent this declination:\r\n“We have looked over with interest _The History of Tammany Hall_, which\r\nyou were good enough to submit to us, but are sorry to say that after a\r\ncareful examination we are unable to persuade ourselves that we could\r\nsuccessfully undertake its publication.” The head of still another\r\nold-established New York publishing house wrote, on March 4, 1913, a\r\nlong apologetic letter giving his reasons for not caring to undertake\r\nthe publication of the work, the principal of those reasons being the\r\nplea that there was not sufficient prospect of gain “to compensate for\r\nsome of the unpleasantness its publishers would have to endure.” Yet\r\na year later a magazine published by this identical house contained a\r\nlaudatory reference to “Myers’s excellent _History of Tammany Hall_.”\r\n\r\nOn April 10, 1913, Mr. Baird wrote to a prominent Boston publishing\r\nhouse. “Before offering the book,” Mr. Baird wrote in part, “I want to\r\ntell you frankly that it has been turned down by other publishers, not\r\nbecause of any lack of excellence or authenticity, but simply because,\r\nas several of the publishers have frankly acknowledged, they ‘are\r\nafraid of reprisals from Tammany Hall.’\r\n\r\n“Your house has been suggested by a publisher as one which is probably\r\nnot so timid as some others, and as you are located out of town you are\r\ntherefore not subject to local influences, and I write to ask if you\r\nwould be interested in having the publication submitted to you.\r\n\r\n“I might add that I have been lecturing on this subject at the City\r\nClub and other prominent clubs in the city, and the subject itself\r\nseemed to bring out record audiences wherever the lecture was given,\r\nand it is because so many people have asked me where they can obtain\r\ncopies of Mr. Myers’s book, that I am prompted to endeavor to have a\r\nreprint of it.”\r\n\r\nThe reply of the Boston publishing house was a curt declination.\r\n\r\nSubsequently the following letter was received by the author from a\r\nprominent New York City attorney:\r\n\r\n“I have been endeavoring to purchase a copy of _The History of Tammany\r\nHall_ published by you, but as yet have been unable to find a copy in\r\nany of the book stores.

The constitution\r\nprovided by his care contained, among other things, a solemn\r\nasseveration, which every member at his initiation was required to\r\nrepeat and subscribe to, that he would sustain the State institutions\r\nand resist a consolidation of power in the general Government.”\r\n\r\nBefore the Revolution, societies variously known as the “Sons of\r\nLiberty” and the “Sons of St. Tammany” had been formed to aid the cause\r\nof independence. Tammany, or Tamanend, was an Indian chief, of whom\r\nfanciful legends have been woven, but of whose real life little can\r\nbe told. Some maintain that he lived in the neighborhood of Scranton,\r\nPa., when William Penn arrived, and that he was present at the great\r\ncouncil under the elm tree. His name is said to have been on Penn’s\r\nfirst treaty with the Indians, April 23, 1683. He is also described as\r\na great chief of the Delaware nation, and his wigwam is said to have\r\nstood on the grounds now occupied by Princeton University. The fame of\r\nhis wisdom, benevolence and love of liberty spreading to the colonists,\r\nthey adopted his name for their patriotic lodges. When societies\r\nsprang up bearing the names of St. George, St. Andrew or St. David and\r\nproclaiming their fealty to King George, the Separatists dubbed Tammany\r\na saint in ridicule of the imported saints. The Revolution over, the\r\n“Sons of Liberty” and the “Sons of St. Tammany” dissolved.\r\n\r\nThe controversy over the adoption of the Federal constitution had the\r\neffect of re-uniting the patriotic lodges. The rich and influential\r\nclasses favored Hamilton’s design of a republic having a President and\r\na Senate chosen for life, and State governments elected by Congress.\r\nOpposed to this attempt toward a highly centralized government were\r\nthe forces which afterward organized the Anti-Federalist party. Their\r\nleader in New York was Governor George Clinton. The greater number of\r\nthe old members of the Liberty and Tammany societies, now familiarly\r\nknown as “Liberty boys,” belonged to this opposition.\r\n\r\nDuring this agitation Hamilton managed to strengthen his party, by\r\ncausing to be removed, in 1787, the political disabilities bearing\r\nupon the Tories. New York was noted for its Tories, more numerous in\r\nproportion than in any other colony, since here, under the Crown,\r\noffices were dispensed more liberally than elsewhere. In the heat of\r\nthe Revolutionary War and the times immediately following it, popular\r\nindignation struck at them in severe laws. In all places held by the\r\npatriot army a Tory refusing to renounce his allegiance to King George\r\nran considerable danger not only of mob visit, but of confiscation\r\nof property, exile, imprisonment, or, in flagrant cases of adherence\r\nto the enemy, death. From 1783 to 1787 the “Liberty boys” of the\r\nRevolution, who formed the bulk of the middle and working classes,\r\ngoverned New York City politics. In freeing the Tories from oppressive\r\nlaws, and opening political life to them, Hamilton at once secured\r\nthe support of a propertied class (for many of them had succeeded in\r\nretaining their estates) numerous enough to form a balance of power and\r\nto enable him to wrest the control of the city from the “Liberty boys.”\r\n\r\nThe elevation to office of many of the hated, aristocratic supporters\r\nof Great Britain inflamed the minds of the “Liberty boys” and their\r\nfollowers, and made the chasm between the classes, already wide, yet\r\nwider. The bitterest feeling cropped out. Hamilton, put upon the\r\ndefensive, took pains in his addresses to assure the people of the\r\nbaselessness of the accusation that he aimed to keep the rich families\r\nin power. That result, however, had been partially assured by the\r\nState constitution of 1777. Gaging sound citizenship by the ownership\r\nof property, the draughtsmen of that instrument allowed only actual\r\nresidents having freeholds to the value of £100, free of all debts, to\r\nvote for Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and State Senators, while a vote\r\nfor the humbler office of Assemblyman was given only to those having\r\nfreeholds of £20 in the county or paying forty shillings rent yearly.\r\nPoor soldiers who had nobly sustained the Revolutionary cause were\r\njustly embittered at being disqualified by reason of their poverty,\r\nwhile full political power was given to the property-owning Tories.\r\n\r\n“The inequality,” wrote one who lived in those days,\r\n\r\n    “was greatly added to by the social and business customs of\r\n    the times.… There was an aristocracy and a democracy whose\r\n    limits were as clearly marked by manner and dress as by legal\r\n    enactment.… The aristocracy controlled capital in trade,\r\n    monopolized banks and banking privileges, which they did not\r\n    hesitate to employ as a means of perpetuating their power.”\r\n\r\nDr. John W. Francis tells, in his _Reminiscences_, of the prevalence in\r\nNew York for years after the Revolution of a supercilious class that\r\nmissed no opportunity of sneering at the demand for political equality\r\nmade by the leather-breeched mechanic with his few shillings a day.\r\n\r\nPermeated with democratic doctrines, the populace detested the landed\r\nclass. The founding of the Society of the Cincinnati was an additional\r\nirritant. Formed by the officers of the Continental army before\r\ndisbandment, this society adopted one clause especially obnoxious\r\nto the radicals. It provided that the eldest male descendant of an\r\noriginal member should be entitled to wear the insignia of the order\r\nand enjoy the privileges of the society, which, it was argued, would be\r\nbest perpetuated in that way. Jefferson saw a danger to the liberties\r\nof the people in this provision, since it would tend to give rise to\r\na race of hereditary nobles, founded on the military, and breeding in\r\nturn other subordinate orders. At Washington’s suggestion the clause\r\nwas modified, but an ugly feeling rankled in the public mind, due to\r\nthe existence of an active party supposedly bent on the establishment\r\nof a disguised form of monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt was at such a juncture of movements and tendencies that the Society\r\nof St. Tammany or Columbian Order was formed. The new organization\r\nconstituted a formal protest against aristocratic influences, and stood\r\nfor the widest democratization in political life.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to the old-world distinctions of the Cincinnati and other\r\nsocieties, the Tammany Society adopted aboriginal forms and usages.\r\nThe officers held Indian titles. The head, or president, chosen from\r\nthirteen Sachems, corresponding to trustees, elected annually, was\r\nstyled Grand Sachem. In its early years the society had a custom, now\r\nobsolete, of conferring the honorary office of Kitchi Okemaw, or Great\r\nGrand Sachem, upon the President of the United States. Washington,\r\nJohn Adams, Jefferson, Madison, Monroe, John Quincy Adams and Jackson\r\nwere hailed successively as the Great Grand Sachems of Tammany. After\r\nthe Sachems came the Sagamore, or Master of Ceremonies, a Scribe, or\r\nsecretary, and a Wiskinskie,[3] or doorkeeper. Instead of using the\r\nordinary calendar designations, the society divided the year into\r\nseasons and these into moons. Its notices bore reckoning from the\r\nyear Columbus discovered America, that of the Declaration of American\r\nIndependence and of its own organization. Instead of inscribing:\r\n“New York, July, 1800,” there would appear: “Manhattan, Season of\r\nFruits, Seventh Moon, Year of Discovery three hundred and eighth; of\r\nIndependence twenty-fourth, and of the Institution the twelfth.” In\r\nearly times the society was divided into tribes, one for each of the\r\nthirteen original States; there were the Eagle, Otter, Panther, Beaver,\r\nBear, Tortoise, Rattlesnake, Tiger, Fox, Deer, Buffalo, Raccoon and\r\nWolf tribes, which stood respectively for New York, New Hampshire,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\r\nDelaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina and\r\nGeorgia. A new member of the Tammany Society had the choice of saying\r\nto which of these tribes he cared to be attached. Frequently the\r\nmembers dressed in Indian garb and carried papooses in their public\r\nparades. They introduced the distinction between “long talks” and\r\n“short talks” in their public addresses. The name “Wigwam” was given to\r\ntheir meeting-place, and Barden’s Tavern was selected as their first\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAt the initiation of the Grand Sachem a song beginning, “Brothers, Our\r\nCouncil Fire Shines Bright, et-hoh!” was sung, and at the initiation\r\nof a member another song was sung, beginning:\r\n\r\n    “Sacred’s the ground where Freedom’s found,\r\n    And Virtue stamps her Name.”\r\n\r\nThe society contemplated founding a chain of Tammany societies over\r\nthe country, and accordingly designated itself as Tammany Society, No.\r\n1. A number sprang into life, but only a few--those in Philadelphia,\r\nProvidence, Brooklyn and Lexington, Ky., continued for any time, and\r\neven these disappeared about the year 1818 or a few years later.\r\n\r\nThe society showed its Indian ceremonies to advantage and gained\r\nmuch prestige by aiding in the conciliation of the Creek Indians.\r\nAfter useless attempts to make a treaty with them, the Government\r\nundertook, as a last resort, in February, 1790, to influence Alexander\r\nMcGillivray, their half-breed chief, to visit New York, where he might\r\nbe induced to sign a treaty. To Col. Marinus Willett, a brave soldier\r\nof the Revolution, and later Mayor of New York City, the mission\r\nwas intrusted. In July, 1790, Willett started North accompanied by\r\nMcGillivray and twenty-eight Creek chiefs and warriors. Upon their\r\narrival in New York, then the seat of the National Government, the\r\nmembers of the Tammany Society, in full Indian costume, welcomed them.\r\nOne phase of the tale has it that the Creeks set up a wild whoop, at\r\nwhose terrifying sound the Tammany make-believe red-faces fled in\r\ndismay. Another version tells that the Tammany Society and the military\r\nescorted the Indians to Secretary Knox’s house, introduced them to\r\nWashington and then led them to the Wigwam at Barden’s Tavern, where\r\nseductive drink was served. On August 2 the Creeks were entertained at\r\na Tammany banquet. A treaty was signed on August 13.\r\n\r\nIn June of the same year Tammany had established, in the old City Hall,\r\na museum “for the preservation of Indian relics.” For a brief while\r\nthe society devoted itself with assiduity to this department, but the\r\npractical men grew tired of it. On June 25, 1795, the museum was given\r\nover to Gardiner Baker, its curator, on condition that it was to be\r\nknown for all time as the Tammany Museum and that each member of the\r\nsociety and his family were to have entrance free. Baker dying, the\r\nmuseum eventually passed into the hands of a professional museum-owner.\r\n\r\nTammany’s chief functions at first seem to have been the celebration\r\nof its anniversary day, May 12; the Fourth of July and Evacuation Day.\r\nThe society’s parades were events in old New York. On May 12, 1789,\r\nthe day of organization, two marquees were built two miles above the\r\ncity, whither the Tammany brethren went to hold their banquet. Thirteen\r\ndischarges of cannon followed each toast. The first one read: “May\r\nHonor, Virtue and Patriotism ever be the distinguishing characteristics\r\nof the sons of St. Tammany.” John Pintard,[4] Tammany’s first Sagamore,\r\nwrote an account[5] of the society’s celebration of May 12, 1791. “The\r\nday,” he says,\r\n\r\n    “was ushered in by a Federal salute from the battery and\r\n    welcomed by a discharge of 13 guns from the brig Grand Sachem,\r\n    lying in the stream. The society assembled at the great Wigwam,\r\n    in Broad street, five hours after the rising of the sun, and\r\n    was conducted from there in an elegant procession to the brick\r\n    meeting house in Beekman street. Before them was borne the cap\r\n    of liberty; after following seven hunters in Tammanial dress,\r\n    then the great standard of the society, in the rear of which\r\n    was the Grand Sachem and other officers. On either side of\r\n    these were formed the members in tribes, each headed by its\r\n    standard bearers and Sachem in full dress. At the brick meeting\r\n    house an oration was delivered by their brother, Josiah Ogden\r\n    Hoffman, to the society and to a most respectable and crowded\r\n    audience. In the most brilliant and pathetic language he traced\r\n    the origin of the Columbian Order and the Society of the\r\n    Cincinnati. From the meeting house the procession proceeded (as\r\n    before) to Campbell’s grounds, where upwards of two hundred\r\n    people partook of a handsome and plentiful repast. The dinner\r\n    was honored by his Excellency [George Clinton] and many of the\r\n    most respectable citizens.”\r\n\r\nThe toasts, that now seem so quaint, mirror the spirit of the diners.\r\n“The Grand Sachem of the Thirteen United Fires,” ran the first, “may\r\nhis declining sun be precious in the sight of the Great Spirit that\r\nthe mild luster of his departing beams may prove no less glorious than\r\nthe effulgence of the rising or transcendent splendor of his meridian\r\ngreatness.” The second: “The head men and chiefs of the Grand Council\r\nof the Thirteen United Fires--may they convince our foes not only of\r\ntheir courage to lift, prudence to direct and clemency to withhold the\r\nhatchet, but of their power to inflict it in their country’s cause.”\r\n\r\nUp to 1835, at least, toasts were an important feature in public\r\ndinners, as they were supposed to disclose the sentiments, political or\r\notherwise, of the person or body from whom they came. In this fashion\r\nthe Tammany Society announced its instant sympathy with the French\r\nRevolution in all its stages. On May 12, 1793, the sixth toast read:\r\n“Success to the _Armies_ of France, and Wisdom, Concord and Firmness\r\nto the Convention.” “The first sentence was hardly articulated,” a\r\nnewspaper[6] records, “when _as one_ the whole company _arose_ and gave\r\nthree cheers, continued by roars of applause for several minutes; the\r\ntoast was then given in whole and the applauses reiterated.”\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock that morning, the same account relates, “the society\r\nhad assembled at Tammanial Hall, in Broad street, and marched to St.\r\nPaul’s Church, where Brother Cadwallader D. Colden delivered to a\r\ncrowded and brilliant audience an animated talk on the excellence of\r\nthe Government and situation of the United States when contrasted\r\nwith those of despotic countries.” In the procession were about 400\r\nmembers in civilian dress. From each hat flowed a bucktail--the symbol\r\nof Liberty--and the standard and cap of Liberty were carried in front\r\nof the line. From the church “the Tammanials went to their Hall, where\r\nsome 150 of them partook of an elegant dinner.”\r\n\r\nPublic feeling ran high in discussing the French Revolution, and there\r\nwere many personal collisions. The Tammany Society was in the vanguard\r\nof the American sympathizers and bore the brunt of abuse. The pamphlets\r\nand newspapers were filled with anonymous threats from both sides. “An\r\nOneida Chief” writes in the _New York Journal and Patriotic Register_,\r\nJune 8, 1793:\r\n\r\n    “A Hint to the Whigs of New York: To hear our Brethren of\r\n    France vilified (with all that low Scurrility of which their\r\n    enemies the English are so well stocked) in our streets and on\r\n    the wharves; nay, in our new and elegant Coffee House; but more\r\n    particularly in that den of ingrates, called Belvidere Club\r\n    House, where at this very moment _those enemies to liberty_ are\r\n    swallowing potent draughts to the destruction and _annihilation\r\n    of Liberty, Equality_ and the _Rights of Man_, is not to\r\n    be borne by freemen and I am fully of opinion that if some\r\n    method is not adopted to suppress such daring and presumptuous\r\n    insults, a band of determined Mohawks, Oneidas and Senekas will\r\n    take upon themselves that necessary duty.”\r\n\r\nThere is no record of the carrying out of this threat.\r\n\r\nDespite its original composition of men of both parties, the Tammany\r\nSociety drifted year by year into being the principal upholder of\r\nthe doctrines of which Jefferson was the chief exponent. Toward the\r\nend of Washington’s administration political feelings developed into\r\nviolent party divisions, and the Tammany Society became largely\r\nAnti-Federalist, or Republican, the Federalist members either\r\nwithdrawing or being reduced to a harmless minority. It toasted the\r\nRepublican leaders vociferously to show the world its sympathies and\r\nprinciples. On May 12, 1796, the glasses ascended to “Citizen” Thomas\r\nJefferson, whose name was received with three cheers, and to “Citizen”\r\nEdward Livingston, for whom nine cheers were given. “The people,”\r\nran one toast, “may they ever at the risk of life and liberty support\r\ntheir equal rights in opposition to Ambition, Tyranny, to Sophistry and\r\nDeception, to Bribery and Corruption and to an enthusiastic fondness\r\nand implicit confidence in their fellow-fallible mortals.”\r\n\r\nTammany had become, by 1796-97, a powerful and an extremely partizan\r\nbody. But it came near being snuffed out of existence in the last year\r\nof Washington’s presidency. Judah Hammond writes that when Washington,\r\nbefore the close of his second term,\r\n\r\n    “rebuked self-creative societies from an apprehension that\r\n    their ultimate tendency would be hostile to the public\r\n    tranquillity, the members of Tammany supposed their institution\r\n    to be included in the reproof, and they almost all forsook\r\n    it. The founder, William Mooney, and a few others continued\r\n    steadfast. At one anniversary they were reduced so low that\r\n    but three persons attended its festival.[7] From this time it\r\n    became a political institution and took ground with Thomas\r\n    Jefferson.”\r\n\r\nTo such straits was driven the society which, a short time after,\r\nsecured absolute control of New York City, and which has held that\r\ngrasp, with but few and brief intermissions, ever since. The contrast\r\nbetween that sorry festival, with its trio of lonesome celebrators, and\r\nthe Tammany Society of a few years afterwards presents one of the most\r\nstriking pictures in American politics.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Mooney was an ex-soldier, who at this time kept a small upholstery\r\nshop at 23 Nassau street. He was charged with having deserted the\r\nAmerican Army, September 16, 1776, and with joining the British forces\r\nin New York, where for a year he wore the King’s uniform. The truth or\r\nfalsity of this charge cannot be ascertained.\r\n\r\n[2] Hammond, _Political History of the State of New York_, Vol. I, p.\r\n341.\r\n\r\n[3] So spelled in all the earlier records.

Relieved\r\nof its Federalist members, it became purely partizan. As yet it was\r\nnot an “organization,” in the modern political sense; it did not seek\r\nthe enrollment and regimentation of voters. Its nature was more that\r\nof a private political club, which sought to influence elections by\r\nspeeches, pamphlets and social means. It shifted its quarters from\r\nBarden’s Tavern to the “Long Room,” a place kept by a sometime Sachem,\r\nAbraham or “Brom” Martling,[1] at the corner of Nassau and Spruce\r\nstreets. This Wigwam was a forlorn, one-story wooden building attached\r\nto Martling’s Tavern, near, or partly overlapping, the spot where\r\nsubsequently Tammany Hall erected its first building--recently the\r\n_Sun_ newspaper building. No larger than a good-sized room the Wigwam\r\nwas contemptuously styled by the Federalists “the Pig Pen.” In that\r\nyear New York City had only 58,000 inhabitants. The Wigwam stood on\r\nthe very outskirts of the city. But it formed a social rendezvous very\r\npopular with the “Bucktails” of the time. Every night men gathered\r\nthere to drink, smoke and “swap” stories. Fitz-Greene Halleck has\r\nwritten of a later time:\r\n\r\n    “There’s a barrel of porter at Tammany Hall,\r\n    And the Bucktails are swigging it all the night long;\r\n    In the time of my boyhood ’twas pleasant to call\r\n    For a seat and cigar mid the jovial throng.”\r\n\r\nThis social custom was begun early in the life of the society, and was\r\nmaintained for several decades.\r\n\r\nAaron Burr was the first real leader of the Tammany Society. He\r\nwas never Grand Sachem or even Sachem; it is doubtful whether he\r\never set foot in the Wigwam; it is known that it was never his\r\nhabit to attend caucuses; but he controlled the society through his\r\nfriends and protégés. The transition of Tammany from an effusive,\r\nspeech-making society to an active political club was mainly through\r\nhis instrumentality. Mooney[2] was a mediocre man, delighting in\r\nextravagant language and Indian ceremonials, and was merely a tool in\r\nthe hands of far abler men. “Burr was our chief,”[3] said Matthew L.\r\nDavis, Burr’s friend and biographer, and several times Grand Sachem of\r\nthe society.\r\n\r\nDavis’s influence on the early career of Tammany was second only to\r\nthat of Burr himself. He was reputed to be the originator of the\r\ntime-honored modes of manufacturing public opinion, carrying primary\r\nmeetings, obtaining the nomination of certain candidates, carrying\r\na ward, a city, a county or even a State. During one period of his\r\nactivity, it is related, meetings were held on different nights in\r\nevery ward in New York City. The most forcible and spirited resolutions\r\nand addresses were passed and published. Not only the city, but the\r\nentire country, was aroused. It was some time before the secret was\r\nknown--that at each of these meetings but three persons were present,\r\nDavis and two friends.\r\n\r\nThough Davis was credited with the authorship of these methods, it is\r\nnot so certain that he did not receive his lessons from Burr. Besides\r\nDavis, Burr’s chief protégés, all of whom became persons of importance\r\nin early New York, were Jacob Barker, John and Robert Swartwout, John\r\nand William P. Van Ness; Benjamin Romaine, Isaac Pierson, John P. Haff\r\nand Jacob Hayes.[4] When Burr was in disgrace William P. Van Ness, at\r\nthat time the patron of the law student Martin Van Buren, wrote a long\r\npamphlet defending him. At the time of his duel with Hamilton these men\r\nsupported him. They made Tammany his machine; and it is clear that they\r\nwere attached to him sincerely, for long after his trial for treason,\r\nTammany Hall, under their influence, tried unsuccessfully to restore\r\nhim to some degree of political power. Burr controlled Tammany Hall\r\nfrom 1797 until even after his fall. From then on to about 1835 his\r\nprotégés either controlled it or were its influential men. The phrase,\r\n“the old Burr faction still active,” is met with as late as 1832, and\r\nthe Burrites were a considerable factor in politics for several years\r\nthereafter. Nearly every one of the Burr leaders, as will be shown, was\r\nguilty of some act of official or private peculation.\r\n\r\nThese were the men Burr used in changing the character of the Tammany\r\nSociety. The leader and his satellites were quite content to have the\r\nTammany rank and file parade in Indian garb and use savage ceremonies;\r\nsuch forms gave the people an idea of pristine simplicity which was\r\na good enough cloak for election scheming. Audacious to a degree and\r\nworking through others, Burr was exceedingly adroit. One of his most\r\nimportant moves was the chartering of the Manhattan Bank. Without this\r\ninstitution Tammany would have been quite ineffective. In those days\r\nbanks had a mightier influence over politics than is now thought.\r\nNew York had only one bank, and that one was violently Federalist.\r\nIts affairs were administered always with a view to contributing to\r\nFederalist success. The directors loaned money to their personal and\r\nparty friends with gross partiality and for questionable purposes. If a\r\nmerchant dared help the opposite party or offended the directors he was\r\ntaught to repent his independence by a rejection of his paper when he\r\nmost needed cash.\r\n\r\nBurr needed this means of monopoly and favoritism to make his political\r\nmachine complete, as well as to amass funds. He, therefore, had\r\nintroduced into the Legislature (1799) a bill, apparently for the\r\npurpose of diminishing the future possibility of yellow fever in New\r\nYork City, incorporating a company, styled the Manhattan Company, to\r\nsupply pure, wholesome water. Supposing the charter granted nothing\r\nmore than this, the legislators passed it. They were much surprised\r\nlater to hear that it contained a carefully worded clause vesting the\r\nManhattan Company with banking powers.[5] The Manhattan Bank speedily\r\nadopted the prevailing partizan tactics.\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1800 was full of personal and party bitterness and was\r\ncontested hotly. To evade the election laws disqualifying the poor,\r\nand working to the advantage of the Federalists, Tammany had recourse\r\nto artifice. Poor Republicans, being unable individually to meet the\r\nproperty qualification, clubbed together and bought property. On the\r\nthree election days[6] Hamilton made speeches at the polls for the\r\nFederalists, and Burr directed political affairs for the Republicans.\r\nTammany used every influence, social and political, to carry the city\r\nfor Jefferson.\r\n\r\nAssemblymen then were not elected by wards, but in bulk, the\r\nLegislature in turn selecting the Presidential electors. The\r\nRepublican Assembly candidates in New York City were elected[7] by a\r\nmajority of _one_, the vote of a butcher, Thomas Winship, being the\r\ndecisive ballot. The Legislature selected Republican electors. This\r\nthrew the Presidential contest into the House of Representatives,\r\ninsuring Jefferson’s success. Though Burr was the choice of the Tammany\r\nchiefs, Jefferson was a favored second. Tammany claimed to have brought\r\nabout the result; and the claim was generally allowed.[8]\r\n\r\nThe success of the Republicans in 1800 opened new possibilities to the\r\nmembers of the Tammany Society. Jefferson richly rewarded some of them\r\nwith offices. In 1801 they advanced their sway further. The society had\r\ndeclared that one of its objects was the repeal of the odious election\r\nlaws. For the present, however, it schemed to circumvent them. The\r\npractise of the previous year of the collective buying of property\r\nto meet the voting qualifications was continued. Under the society’s\r\nencouragement, and with money probably furnished by it, thirty-nine\r\npoor Republicans in November, 1801, bought a house and lot of ground in\r\nthe Fifth Ward. Their votes turned the ward election. The thirty-nine\r\nwere mainly penniless students and mechanics; among them were such men\r\nas Daniel D. Tompkins, future Governor of New York and Vice-President\r\nof the United States; Richard Riker, coming Recorder of New York\r\nCity; William P. Van Ness, United States Judge to be, Teunis Wortman,\r\nWilliam A. Davis, Robert Swartwout and John L. Broome, all of whom\r\nbecame men of power.\r\n\r\nThe result in the Fifth Ward, and in the Fourth Ward, where seventy\r\nTammany votes had been secured through the joint purchase of a house\r\nand lot at 50 Dey street, gave the society a majority in the Common\r\nCouncil.[9] The Federalist Aldermen decided to throw out these votes,\r\nas being against the spirit of the law, and to seat their own party\r\ncandidates. The Republican Mayor, Edward Livingston, who presided over\r\nthe deliberations, maintained that he had a right to vote.[10] His vote\r\nmade a tie. The Tammany, or Republican, men were arbitrarily seated,\r\nupon which, on December 14, 1801, eight Federalists seceded to prevent\r\na quorum;[11] they did not return until the following March.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany Society members, or as they were called until 1813 or\r\n1814, the Martling Men (from their meeting place), soon had a far more\r\ninteresting task than fighting Federalists. This was the long, bitter\r\nwarfare, extending over twenty-six years, which they waged against De\r\nWitt Clinton, one of the ablest politicians New York has known, and\r\nremembered by a grateful posterity as the creator of the Erie Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Martling was several times elected a Sachem. Like most of the\r\nRepublican politicians of the day he had a habit of settling his\r\ndisputes in person. Taking offense, one day, at the remarks of one\r\nJohn Richard Huggins, a hair-dresser, he called at Huggins’s shop, 104\r\nBroadway, and administered to him a sound thrashing with a rope. When\r\nhe grew old Tammany took care of him by appointing him to an obscure\r\noffice (Keeper of the City Hall).\r\n\r\n[2] Mooney was a life-long admirer of Burr, but was ill-requited in\r\nhis friendship. At Mooney’s death, in 1831, a heap of unpaid bills for\r\ngoods charged to Burr was found.\r\n\r\n[3] _American Citizen_, July 18, 1809.\r\n\r\n[4] Hayes, as High Constable of the city from 1800 to 1850, was a\r\ncharacter in old New York. He was so devoted to Burr that he named his\r\nsecond son for him.\r\n\r\n[5] Hammond, Vol. I, pp. 129-30.\r\n\r\n[6] Until 1840 three days were required for elections in the city and\r\nState. In the earlier period ballots were invariably written. The first\r\none-day election held in the city was that of April 14, 1840. For the\r\nrest of the State, however, the change from three-day elections was not\r\nmade until several years later.\r\n\r\n[7] During the greater part of the first quarter of the century members\r\nof the Legislature, Governor and certain other State officers were\r\nelected in April, the Aldermen being elected in November.\r\n\r\n[8] Shortly after Jefferson’s inauguration Matthew L. Davis called\r\nupon the President at Washington and talked in a boastful spirit of\r\nthe immense influence New York had exerted, telling Jefferson that\r\nhis elevation was brought about solely by the power and management of\r\nthe Tammany Society. Jefferson listened. Then reaching out his hand\r\nand catching a large fly, he requested Davis to note the remarkable\r\ndisproportion in size between one portion of the insect and its body.\r\nThe hint was not lost on Davis, who, though not knowing whether\r\nJefferson referred to New York or to him, ceased to talk on the subject.\r\n\r\n[9] The Common Council from 1730 to 1830 consisted of Aldermen and\r\nAssistant Aldermen, _sitting as one board_. The terms “Board of\r\nAldermen” and “Common Council” are used interchangeably.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ms. Minutes of the Common Council_, Vol. 13, pp. 351-52.\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._, pp. 353-56.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTAMMANY QUARRELS WITH DE WITT CLINTON\r\n\r\n1802-1809\r\n\r\n\r\nThe quarrel between Tammany and De Witt Clinton arose from Clinton’s\r\ncharge in 1802 that Burr was a traitor to the Republican party and had\r\nconspired to defeat Jefferson. De Witt Clinton was a nephew of George\r\nClinton. When a very young man he was Scribe of the Tammany Society.\r\nOwing to the influence of his powerful relative, backed by his own\r\nability, he had become a United States Senator, at the promising age\r\nof thirty-three. His principal fault was his unbridled temper, which\r\nled him to speak harshly of those who displeased him. George Clinton\r\nthought himself, on account of his age and long public service,\r\nentitled to the place and honors heaped upon Burr, whom he despised\r\nas an unprincipled usurper. He was too old, however, to carry on a\r\ncontest, and De Witt Clinton undertook to shatter the Burr faction for\r\nhim. To oppose the Tammany Society, which embraced in itself nearly\r\nall there was of the Republican party in New York City, was no slight\r\nmatter. But De Witt Clinton, with the confidence that comes of steady,\r\nrapid advancement, went about it aggressively. He had extraordinary\r\nqualities of mind and heart which raised him far above the mere\r\npoliticians of his day.\r\n\r\nSuch of the elective offices as were allowed the city were filled by\r\nthe Tammany Republicans from 1800 to 1809. State Senators, Assemblymen\r\nand Aldermen were elective, but the Mayor, Sheriff, Recorder,\r\nJustices of the Peace of counties--in fact, nearly all civil and\r\nmilitary officers from the heads of departments and Judgeships of\r\nthe Supreme Court down to even auctioneers--were appointed by a body\r\nat Albany known as the Council of Appointment, which was one of the\r\nold constitutional devices for centralizing political power. Four\r\nState Senators, chosen by the Assembly, comprised, with the Governor,\r\nthis Council. Gov. Clinton, as president of this board, claimed the\r\nexclusive right of nomination, and effectually concentrated in himself\r\nall the immense power it yielded. He had De Witt Clinton transferred\r\nfrom the post of United States Senator to that of Mayor of New York\r\nCity in 1803, and filled offices in all the counties with his relatives\r\nor partizans. The spoils system was in full force, as exemplified by\r\nthe Council’s sudden and frequent changes. Though swaying New York\r\nCity, Tammany could get only a few State and city offices, the Clintons\r\nholding the power elsewhere throughout the State and in the Council of\r\nAppointment. Hence in fighting the Clintons, Tammany confronted a power\r\nmuch superior in resources.\r\n\r\nOne of the first moves of the Clintons was to get control of the\r\nManhattan Bank. They caused John Swartwout, Burr’s associate director,\r\nto be turned out. Some words ensued, and De Witt Clinton styled\r\nSwartwout a liar, a scoundrel and a villain. Swartwout set about\r\nresenting the insult in the gentlemanly mode of the day. Clinton\r\nreadily accepted a challenge, and five shots were fired, two of which\r\nhit Swartwout, who, upon being asked whether he had had enough said\r\nthat he had not; but the duel was stopped by the seconds.\r\n\r\nWhile the Clintons were searching for a good pretext to overthrow Burr,\r\nthe latter injudiciously supplied it himself when in 1804 he opposed\r\nthe election of Morgan Lewis, his own party’s nominee for Governor.\r\nBurr’s action gave rise to much acrimony; and from that time he was\r\nostracized by every part of the Republican party in New York except\r\nthe chiefs of the Tammany Society, or Martling Men. He fell altogether\r\ninto disgrace with the general public when he shot Alexander\r\nHamilton in a duel, July 11, 1804. Tammany, however, still clung to\r\nhim. Two of Tammany’s chiefs--Nathaniel Pendleton and William P. Van\r\nNess--accompanied Burr to the field; John Swartwout, another chief, was\r\nat Burr’s house awaiting his return. The Tammany men looked upon much\r\nof the excitement over Hamilton’s death as manufactured. But as if to\r\nyield to public opinion, the society on July 13 issued a notice to its\r\nmembers to join in the procession to pay the “last tribute of respect\r\nto the _manes_ of Hamilton.”\r\n\r\nIn the inflamed state of public feeling which condemned everything\r\nconnected with Burr and caused his indictment in two States, the\r\nSachems knew it would be unwise for a time to make any attempt to\r\nrestore him to political power. They found their opportunity in\r\nDecember, 1805, when, strangely enough, De Witt Clinton, forced by\r\nthe exigencies of politics, made overtures to form a union with the\r\nBurrites in order to resist the powerful Livingston family, which, with\r\nGov. Morgan Lewis at its head, was threatening the Clinton family. The\r\nBurrites thought they would get the better of the bargain and be able\r\nto reinstate their chief.\r\n\r\nThe negotiators met secretly February 20, 1806, at Dyde’s Hotel. John\r\nSwartwout and the other Tammany chiefs insisted as conditions of the\r\nunion that Burr should be recognized as a Republican; that his friends\r\nshould be well cared for in the distribution of offices, and that\r\n“Burrism” should never be urged as an objection against them. The\r\nClintons, anxious to beat down the Livingstons, were ready to agree to\r\nthese terms, knowing that Burr’s prestige was utterly swept away and\r\nthat any effort of his followers to thrust him forward again would be\r\na failure. Clintonites and Burrites set to drinking hilariously as a\r\ntoken of good will. But their joy was premature.\r\n\r\nWhen the body of the Tammany men learned of the arrangement they were\r\naroused. The Sachems drew off, and the Tammany Society continued to\r\nrevile Clinton and to be reviled in return.\r\n\r\nIt was just before this that the Tammany Hall political organization,\r\nas apparently distinct from the Tammany Society, was created. In 1805\r\nthe society made application for, and obtained from the Legislature,\r\nthe charter, which still remains in force, incorporating it as a\r\nbenevolent and charitable body “for the purpose of affording relief to\r\nthe indigent and distressed members of said association, their widows\r\nand orphans and others who may be proper objects of their charity.”\r\n\r\nThe wording of the charter deluded only the simple. Everybody knew\r\nthat the society was the center around which the Republican politics\r\nof the city revolved. It had its public and its secret aspects. “This\r\nsociety,” says _Longworth’s American Almanac, New York Register and\r\nCity Directory_ for 1807-1808, in a description of Tammany, “has a\r\nconstitution in two parts--public and private--the public relates to\r\nall external or public matters; and the private, to the arcana and all\r\ntransactions which do not meet the public eye, and on which its code of\r\nlaws are founded.”\r\n\r\nThe Sachems knew that to continue appearing as a political club would\r\nbe most impolitic. Year after year since 1798 the criticisms directed\r\nat the self-appointed task of providing candidates for the popular\r\nsuffrage grew louder. In 1806 these murmurings extended to Tammany’s\r\nown voters. Honest Republicans began to voice their suspicions of\r\ncaucuses which never met and public meetings called by nobody knew\r\nwhom. The Sachems, though perfectly satisfied with the established\r\nforms which gave them such direct authority, wisely recognized the need\r\nof a change.\r\n\r\nIt was agreed that the Republicans should assemble in each ward to\r\nchoose a ward committee of three and that these ward committees should\r\nconstitute a general committee, which should have the power of\r\nconvening all public meetings of the party and of making preparatory\r\narrangements for approaching elections. This was the origin of the\r\nTammany Hall General Committee, which, consisting then of thirty\r\nmembers, has been expanded in present times to over five thousand\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time each of the ten wards began sending seven\r\ndelegates to Martling’s, the seventy forming a nominating committee,\r\nwhich alone had the right to nominate candidates. The seventy met\r\nin open convention. At times each member would have a candidate for\r\nthe Assembly, to which the city then sent eleven members. These\r\nimprovements on the old method gave, naturally, an air of real\r\ndemocracy to the proceedings of the Tammany faction in the city and\r\nhad the effect of softening public criticism. Yet behind the scenes\r\nthe former leaders contrived to bring things about pretty much as they\r\nplanned.\r\n\r\nThe action of the nominating committee was not final, however. It was\r\na strict rule that the committee’s nominations be submitted to the\r\nwards and to a later meeting of all the Republican electors who chose\r\nto attend and who would vote their approval or disapproval. If a name\r\nwere voted down, another candidate was substituted by the meeting\r\nitself. This was called the “great popular meeting,” and its design\r\nwas supposed to vest fully in the Republican voters the choice of\r\nthe candidates for whom they were to vote. But in those days, as has\r\nalways been the case, most voters were so engrossed in their ordinary\r\noccupations that they gave little more attention to politics than to\r\nvote; and the leaders, except on special occasions, found it easy to\r\nfill the great popular meeting, as well as other meetings, with their\r\nfriends and creatures, sending out runners, and often in the winter,\r\nsleighs, for the dilatory. To the general and nominating committees\r\nwas added, several years later, a correspondence committee, which was\r\nempowered to call meetings of the party when necessary, the leaders\r\nhaving found the general committee too slow and cumbersome a means\r\nthrough which to reach that important end.\r\n\r\nTo hold public favor, the Tammany Society thought prudent to make it\r\nappear that it was animated by patriotic motives instead of the desire\r\nfor offices. That the people might see how dearly above all things\r\nTammany prized its Revolutionary traditions, the society on April 13,\r\n1808, marched in rank to Wallabout, where it laid the corner-stone of a\r\nvault in which were to be placed the bones of 11,500 patriots who had\r\ndied on board the British prison ships. On April 26, the vault being\r\ncompleted, the remains were laid in it. The Tammany Society, headed by\r\nBenjamin Romaine and the military; the municipal officials, Gov. Daniel\r\nD. Tompkins, members of Congress, Army and Navy officers, and many\r\nother detachments of men of lesser note participated in the ceremony.\r\n\r\nThe Federalists maintained that Tammany’s patriotic show was merely an\r\nelection maneuver. Subsequent developments did not help to disprove the\r\ncharge. The society proclaimed far and wide its intention of building\r\na monument over the vault, and induced the Legislature to make a grant\r\nof land worth $1,000 for the purpose. Associations and individuals\r\nlikewise contributed. The political ceremonies connected with the\r\nburial having their expected effect, Tammany forgot altogether about\r\nits project until ugly rumors, pointing to the misuse of the money\r\ncollected, forced the society in 1821 to petition the Legislature for\r\nfurther aid in erecting the monument. On that occasion the Tammany\r\nSociety was denounced bitterly. It was brought out that such was\r\nTammany’s interest in the monument that no request was ever made for\r\nthe land granted by the Legislature in 1808. The Legislature, however,\r\ngranted $1,000 in cash.[1] This sum was not enough; and as Tammany did\r\nnot swell the amount, though its Sachems were rich with the spoils of\r\noffice, a resolution was introduced in the Assembly, March 4, 1826,[2]\r\nstating that as the $1,000 appropriated February 27, 1821, had not been\r\nused for the purpose but remained in the hands of Benjamin Romaine,\r\nthe society’s treasurer, it should be returned, and threatening legal\r\nproceedings in case it was not. This resolution, slightly amended, was\r\npassed on a close vote. There is, however, no available record of what\r\nbecame of the $1,000.\r\n\r\nDuring three years, culminating in 1809, a series of disclosures\r\nregarding the corruption of Tammany officials astounded the city.\r\nRumors grew so persistent that the Common Council was forced by public\r\nopinion to investigate. In the resultant revelations many Tammany\r\nchiefs suffered.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Romaine, variously Sachem and Grand Sachem, was removed in\r\n1806 from the office of City Controller for malfeasance, though the\r\nCommon Council was controlled by his own party.[3] As a trustee of\r\ncorporation property he had fraudulently obtained valuable land in the\r\nheart of the city, without paying for it. The affair caused a very\r\nconsiderable scandal. The Common Council had repeatedly passed strong\r\nresolutions calling on him to explain. Romaine must have settled in\r\nsome fashion; for there is no evidence that he was prosecuted.\r\n\r\nOn January 26, 1807, Philip I. Arcularius, Superintendent of the\r\nAlmshouse, and Cornelius Warner, Superintendent of Public Repairs, were\r\nremoved summarily.[4] It was shown that Warner had defrauded the city\r\nas well as the men who worked under him.[5]\r\n\r\nJonas Humbert, Inspector of Bread and sometime Sachem, was proved to\r\nhave extorted a third of the fees collected by Flour Inspector Jones,\r\nunder the threat of having Jones put out of office. In consequence\r\nof the facts becoming known, Humbert and his associate Inspector,\r\nChristian Nestell, discreetly resigned their offices--probably to avert\r\nofficial investigation.[6]\r\n\r\nAbraham Stagg, another of the dynasty of Grand Sachems, as Collector\r\nof Assessments failed, it was disclosed in 1808, to account for about\r\n$1,000.[7] Two other Assessment Collectors, Samuel L. Page (for a long\r\ntime prominent in Tammany councils), and Simon Ackerman, were likewise\r\nfound to be embezzlers.[8] Stagg and Page managed to make good their\r\ndeficit by turning over to the city certain property, but Ackerman\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nJohn Bingham, at times Sachem, and a noted politician of the day,\r\nmanaged, through his position as an Alderman, to wheedle the city\r\ninto selling to his brother-in-law land which later he influenced the\r\ncorporation to buy back at an exorbitant price. The Common Council,\r\nspurred by public opinion, demanded its reconveyance.[9] Even Bingham’s\r\npowerful friend, Matthew L. Davis, could not silence the scandal, for\r\nDavis himself had to meet a charge that while defending the Embargo at\r\nMartling’s he was caught smuggling out flour in quantities that yielded\r\nhim a desirable income.\r\n\r\nBut worse than these disclosures was that affecting the society’s\r\nfounder, William Mooney. The Common Council in 1808 appointed him\r\nSuperintendent of the Almshouse, at an annual recompense of $1,000 and\r\nthe support of his family in the place, provided that this latter item\r\nshould not amount to over $500. Mooney had a more exalted idea of how\r\nhe and his family ought to live. In the summer of 1809 the city fathers\r\nappointed a committee to investigate. The outcome was surprising.\r\nMooney had spent nearly $4,000 on himself and family in addition to\r\nhis salary; he had taken from the city supplies about $1,000 worth of\r\narticles, and moreover had expended various sums for “trifles for\r\nMrs. Mooney”--a term which survived for many years in local politics.\r\nThe ofttimes Grand Sachem of the Tammany Society could not explain his\r\nindulgences satisfactorily, and the Common Council relieved him of the\r\ncares of office, only one Alderman voting for his retention.[10]\r\n\r\nMost of these leaders were only momentarily incommoded, the Tammany\r\nSociety continuing many of them, for years after, in positions of trust\r\nand influence. Mooney subsequently was repeatedly chosen Grand Sachem\r\nand Father of the Council; Romaine was elected Grand Sachem in 1808,\r\nagain in 1813, and frequently Sachem; Matthew L. Davis was elected\r\nGrand Sachem in 1814 and reelected in 1815[11] and was a Sachem for\r\nyears later; Abraham Stagg remained a leader and continued to get\r\ncontracts for street paving and regulating, and neither Jonas Humbert\r\nnor John Bingham suffered a loss of influence with the Wigwam men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Sachems were professing the highest virtue. The society’s\r\ncalls for meetings ran like this:\r\n\r\n    “Tammany Society, or Columbian Order--Brothers, You are\r\n    requested to assemble around the council fire in the Great\r\n    Wigwam, No. 1, on Saturday, the 12th inst., at 9 o’clock A. M.\r\n    (wearing a bucktail in your hat), to celebrate the anniversary\r\n    of the Columbian Order and recount to each other the deeds of\r\n    our departed chiefs and warriors in order that it may stimulate\r\n    us _to imitate them in whatever is virtuous and just_.”[12]\r\n\r\nThe public, however, took another view of the matter. These scandals,\r\nand the showing of a deficit in the city’s accounts of $250,000, hurt\r\nTammany’s prestige considerably. The Republican strength in the city at\r\nthe election of April, 1809, showed a decrease of six hundred votes,\r\nthe majority being only 116, while the Federalists carried the State,\r\nand thus secured control of the Council of Appointment.\r\n\r\nThe lesson was lost on the leaders. The society at this time was led by\r\nvarious men, of whom Teunis Wortman[13] was considered the chief power.\r\nWortman was as enraged at the defection of these few hundred voters as\r\nhis successors were at a later day at an adverse majority of tens of\r\nthousands. He caused a meeting to be held at Martling’s on May 19, and\r\nsecured the appointment of a committee, with one member from each of\r\nthe ten wards, instructed to inquire into the causes contributing to\r\nlessen Tammany’s usual majority. The committee was further instructed\r\nto call a general meeting of the Republican citizens of the county,\r\non the completion of its investigation, and to report to them, that\r\nit might be known who were their friends and who their enemies. Here\r\nis to be seen the first manifestation of that systematic discipline\r\nwhich Tammany Hall thereafter exercised. Wortman’s plan excited both\r\nClintonites and Federalists. The committee was called “the committee\r\nof spies,” and was regarded generally as the beginning of a system of\r\nintimidation and proscription.\r\n\r\nIn the passionate acrimony of the struggle between Tammany and the\r\nClintons, the Federalists seemed to be well-nigh forgotten. The\r\nspeakers and writers of each side assailed the other with great fury.\r\nOne of these was James Cheetham, a Clinton supporter and editor of\r\nthe _American Citizen_. Goaded by his strictures, the Tammany Society\r\non the night of February 28, 1809, expelled him from membership on\r\nthe grounds that he had assailed the general Government and vilified\r\nJefferson.\r\n\r\nIn the _American Citizen_ of March 1, Cheetham replied that the\r\nresolution was carried by trickery. “Tammany Society,” Cheetham\r\ncontinued, “was chartered by the Legislature of the State for\r\n_charitable purposes_. Not a member of the Legislature, when it was\r\nchartered, imagined, I dare to say, that it would be thus perverted to\r\nthe worst purposes of faction.” On May 1 he sent this note to the Grand\r\nSachem:\r\n\r\n    “Sir, I decline membership in Tammany Society. Originally\r\n    national and Republican, it has degenerated into a savage\r\n    barbarity.”\r\n\r\nCheetham then wrote to Grand Sachem Cowdrey for a certified copy of the\r\nproceedings, saying he wanted it to base an action which he would bring\r\nfor the annulment of the charter of the Tammany Society for misuser.\r\nCowdrey expressed regret at not being able to accommodate him. “Tammany\r\nSociety,” wrote Cowdrey,\r\n\r\n    “is an institution that has done much good and may and\r\n    undoubtedly will do more.… I do not think one error can or\r\n    ought to cancel its long list of good actions and wrest from it\r\n    its charter of incorporation, the basis of its stability and\r\n    existence.”\r\n\r\nThe _American Citizen_ thereupon bristled with fiercer attacks upon\r\nTammany. “Jacobin clubs,” says “A Disciple of Washington,” in this\r\nnewspaper, July 29, 1809,\r\n\r\n    “are becoming organized to overawe, not only the electors but\r\n    the elected under our government; such are the Washington and\r\n    the Tammany Societies. The latter was originally instituted\r\n    for harmless purposes and long remained harmless in its acts;\r\n    members from all parties were admitted to it; but we have seen\r\n    it become a tremendous political machine.… The Washington\r\n    Jacobin Club, it is said, consists of at least two thousand\r\n    rank and file, and the Tammany Jacobins to perhaps as many.…\r\n    The time will come, and that speedily, when the Legislature,\r\n    the Governor and the Council of Appointment shall not dare to\r\n    disobey their edicts.”\r\n\r\nTammany retaliated upon Cheetham by having a bill passed by the\r\nLegislature taking away from him the position of State Printer, which\r\npaid $3,000 a year.\r\n\r\nTammany’s comparative weakness in the city, as shown in the recent\r\nvote, prompted Clinton to suggest a compromise and union of forces.\r\nOvertures were made by his agents, and on July 13, 1809, twenty-eight\r\nof the leaders of the Clinton, Madison, Burr and Lewis factions met in\r\na private room at Coleman’s Fair House. Matthew L. Davis told them the\r\nchiefs ought to unite; experience demonstrated that if they did they\r\nwould lead the rest--meaning the voters. Tammany, he said, welcomed\r\na union of the Republican forces so as to prevent the election of a\r\nFederalist Council of Appointment. Davis and Wortman proposed that they\r\nunite to prevent any removals from office; that the two opposition\r\nRepublican clubs in turn should be destroyed and that their members\r\nshould go back to the Tammany Society, which, being on the decline,\r\nmust be reenforced. Or, if it should be thought advisable to put down\r\nthe Tammany Society, “considering its prevailing disrepute,” then a new\r\nsociety should be organized in which Burrites, Lewisites, Clintonites\r\nand Madisonians were to be admitted members under the general family\r\nand brotherly name of Republican.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton cautiously kept away from this meeting, allowing his\r\nlieutenants to do the work of outwitting Tammany. A committee of ten\r\nwas appointed to consider whether a coalition of the chiefs were\r\npracticable; whether, if it were, the people would agree to it; whether\r\nthe Whig (opposition Republican) clubs should be destroyed and whether\r\nthe Tammany Society should be reenforced.\r\n\r\nThe meeting came to naught. In this effort to win over the Tammany\r\nchiefs, De Witt Clinton abandoned his protégé and dependent, Cheetham,\r\nwho had made himself obnoxious to them. Finding Clinton’s political\r\nand financial support withdrawn, Cheetham, out of revenge, published\r\nthe proceedings of this secret meeting in the _American Citizen_, and,\r\nawakening public indignation, closed the bargaining. A few nights later\r\na Tammany mob threw brickbats in the windows of Cheetham’s house. By\r\nhis death, on September 19, 1810, Tammany was freed from one of its\r\nearliest and most vindictive assailants.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Journal of the Assembly_, 1821, p. 532, also p. 758.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, 1826, p. 750.\r\n\r\n[3] _MS.

He suddenly shifted to Tammany, on seeing better\r\nopportunities of advancement with that body.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSLOW RECOVERY FROM DISASTER\r\n\r\n1809-1815\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tammany men fared badly for a time. During 1809 the Council of\r\nAppointment removed numbers of them from office. In November the\r\nFederalists elected a majority of their Aldermanic ticket, and in\r\nApril, 1810, they elected their Assembly ticket by the close majority\r\nof 36. Even when the Federalists were beaten the following year, it\r\nbrought no good to Tammany, for a Clintonite Council of Appointment\r\ndispensed the offices. Clinton, though ousted from the Mayoralty in\r\n1810 to make room for the Federalist Jacob Radcliff, was again made\r\nMayor in the Spring of 1811.\r\n\r\nBut before long affairs took another turn. Tammany was the only real\r\nRepublican organization in the city. It stood for the national party.\r\nAs men were inclined to vote more for party success than for particular\r\nlocal nominees, Tammany’s candidates were certain to be swept in at\r\nsome time on the strength of party adherence. While the rank and file\r\nof the organization were concerned in seeing its candidates successful\r\nonly inasmuch as that meant the success of democratic principles, the\r\nleaders intrigued constantly for spoils at the expense of principles.\r\nBut whatever their conduct might be, they were sure of success when the\r\nnext wave of Republican feeling carried the party to victory.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton’s following was largely personal. Drawing, it was\r\nestimated, from $10,000 to $20,000 a year in salary and fees as Mayor,\r\nhe lived in high style and distributed bounty liberally among his\r\nsupporters. His income aroused the wonder of his contemporaries. The\r\nPresident of the United States received $25,000 annually; the Mayor of\r\nPhiladelphia, $2,000. “Posterity,” said one observer, “will read with\r\nastonishment that a Mayor of New York should make the enormous sum of\r\n$15,000 out of his office.” This was no inconsequential salary at a\r\ntime when a man worth $50,000 was thought rich; when a good house could\r\nbe rented for $350 a year, and $750 or $800 would meet the expenses of\r\nthe average family. Many of those whom Clinton helped picked a quarrel\r\nwith him later, in order to have a pretext for the repudiation of their\r\ndebts, and joined Tammany.\r\n\r\nTammany had the party machine, but Clinton had a powerful hold on the\r\nlower classes, especially the Irish. As United States Senator he had\r\nbeen foremost in having the naturalization period reduced from fourteen\r\nto five years, and he made himself popular with them in other ways. He,\r\nhimself, was of Irish descent.\r\n\r\nThe Irish were bitter opponents of Tammany Hall. The prejudice against\r\nallowing “adopted citizens” to mingle in politics was deep; and Tammany\r\nclaimed to be a thoroughly native body. As early as May 12, 1791, at\r\nCampbell’s Tavern, Greenwich, the Tammany Society had announced that\r\nbeing a national body, it consisted of Americans born, who would fill\r\nall offices; though adopted Americans were eligible to honorary posts,\r\nsuch as warriors and hunters. An “adopted citizen” was looked upon\r\nas an “exotic.” Religious feeling, too, was conspicuous. It was only\r\nafter repeated hostile demonstrations that Tammany would consent, in\r\n1809, for the first time to place a Catholic--Patrick McKay--upon its\r\nAssembly ticket.\r\n\r\nThe accession of the Livingston family had helped the society, adding\r\nthe support of a considerable faction and “respectability.” The\r\nLivingstons, intent on superseding the Clintons, seized on Tammany as\r\na good lever. Above all, it was necessary to have a full application\r\nof “respectability,” and to further that end the society put up a\r\npretentious building--the recent _Sun_ newspaper building. In 1802\r\nthe Tammany Society had tried by subscription to build a fine Wigwam,\r\nbut was unsuccessful. The unwisdom of staying in such a place as\r\nMartling’s, which subjected them to gibes, and which was described as\r\n“the Den where the Wolves and Bears and Panthers assemble and drink\r\ndown large potations of beer,” was impressed upon the Sachems who, led\r\nby Jacob Barker, the largest shipbuilder in the country at the time,\r\nraised the sum of $28,000. The new Wigwam was opened in 1811, with the\r\npeculiar Indian ceremonies. Sachem Abraham M. Valentine--the same man\r\nwho, for malfeasance, was afterward (May 26, 1830) removed from the\r\noffice of Police Magistrate[1]--was the grand marshal of the day.\r\n\r\nFrom 1811 the Tammany, or Martling, men came under the general term\r\nof the Tammany Hall party or Tammany Hall; the general committee was\r\ncalled technically the Democratic-Republican General Committee. The\r\nTammany Society, with its eleven hundred members, now more than ever\r\n_appeared_ distinct from the Tammany Hall political body. Though the\r\ngeneral committee was supplied with the use of rooms and the hall in\r\nthe building, it met on different nights from the society, and to all\r\nappearances acted independently of it. But the society, in fact, was\r\nand continued to be, the secret ruler of the political organization.\r\nIts Sachems were chosen yearly from the most influential of the local\r\nTammany political leaders.\r\n\r\nDe Witt Clinton aimed to be President of the United States and schemed\r\nfor his nomination by the Republican Legislative caucus. Early\r\nin 1811 he sought and received from the caucus the nomination for\r\nLieutenant-Governor. He purposed to hold both the offices of Mayor\r\nand Lieutenant-Governor, while spending as much time as he could at\r\nAlbany so as to bring his direct influence to bear in person. As a\r\nState officer he could do this without loss of dignity. He would\r\nhave preferred the post of State Senator, but he feared if he stood\r\nfor election in New York City Tammany would defeat him. The chiefs,\r\nregarding his nomination as treachery toward Madison, immediately held\r\na meeting and issued a notice that they ceased to consider him a member\r\nof the Republican party; that he was not only opposing Madison but was\r\nbent on establishing a pernicious family aristocracy.\r\n\r\nWhen the Clinton men tried to hold a counter meeting at the Union\r\nHotel a few days later, the Tammany men rushed in and put them to\r\nflight.[2] Tammany was so anxious to defeat Clinton that it supported\r\nthe Federalist candidate for Lieutenant-Governor, defeating the\r\naggressive Mayor. But Clinton obtained the caucus nomination for\r\nPresident. His partizans voted the Federalist Assembly ticket (1812)\r\nrather than aid the Republican ticket of Tammany Hall. Assisted by the\r\nFederalists, Clinton received the electoral vote of New York State, but\r\nwas overwhelmed by Madison. His course seemed precisely that with which\r\nTammany had charged him--treason to the party to which he professed to\r\nbelong. In a short time, the Wigwam succeeded in influencing nearly all\r\nthe Republicans in New York City against him.\r\n\r\nOne other event helped to bring back strength and prestige to\r\nTammany Hall. This was the War of 1812, which Tammany called for and\r\nsupported. On February 26, four months before war was declared, the\r\nTammany Society passed resolutions recommending immediate war with\r\nGreat Britain unless she should repeal her “Orders in Council.” The\r\nmembers pledged themselves to support the Government “in that just\r\nand necessary war” with their “lives, fortunes and sacred honor.” The\r\nconservative element execrated Tammany, but the supporters of the war\r\ncame to look upon it more favorably, and about a thousand persons, some\r\nof whom had been members before but had ceased attendance, applied\r\nfor membership. Throughout the conflict Tammany Hall was the resort\r\nof the war-party. At the news of each victory the flag was hoisted to\r\nthe breeze and a celebration followed. The successful military and\r\nnaval men were banqueted there, while hundreds of candles illumined\r\nevery window in the building. On August 31, 1814, 1150 members of the\r\nsociety marched to build defenses in Brooklyn; but this was not done\r\nuntil public pressure forced it, for by August 15 at least twenty other\r\nsocieties, civil and trades, had volunteered, and Tammany had to make\r\ngood its pretensions.\r\n\r\nThe leaders prospered by Madison’s favor. From one contract alone\r\nMatthew L. Davis reaped $80,000, and Nathan Sanford was credited with\r\nmaking his office of United States District Attorney at New York yield\r\nas high as $30,000 a year. The lesser political workers were rewarded\r\nproportionately. Having a direct and considerable interest in the\r\nsuccess of Madison’s administration, they were indefatigable partizans.\r\nSome of the Tammany leaders proved their devotion to their country’s\r\ncause by doing service in the Quartermaster’s Department. Among these\r\nwere the two Swartwouts (John and Robert), who became Generals, and\r\nRomaine, who became a Colonel.\r\n\r\nThis war had the effect of causing the society to abandon its custom\r\nof marching in Indian garb.[3] In 1813 the Indians in the Northwest,\r\nincited by British agents, went on the war-path, torturing and\r\nscalping, devastating settlements and killing defenseless men, women\r\nand children. Their very name became repulsive to the whites. The\r\nsociety seemed to be callous to this feeling, and began preparations\r\nfor its annual parades, in the usual Indian costumes, with painted\r\nfaces, wearing bearskins and carrying papooses. The Federalists\r\ndeclared that these exhibitions, at all times ridiculous and absurd,\r\nwould be little short of criminal after the cruelties which were being\r\ncommitted by the Tammany men of the wilderness. These attacks affected\r\nthe Tammany Society so much that a majority of the members, consisting\r\nmainly of the politicians and young men, held a secret meeting and\r\nabolished all imitations of the Indians, in dress and manners as well\r\nas in name, and resolved that the officers should thereafter bear plain\r\nEnglish titles.\r\n\r\nMooney opposed the change.[4] He would not listen to having those\r\npicturesque and native ceremonies, which he himself had ordained, wiped\r\nout. He resigned as Grand Sachem, and many of the Sachems went with\r\nhim. On May 1, 1813, Benjamin Romaine was elected Grand Sachem, and\r\nother “reformers” were chosen as Sachems. On July 4 the Tammany Society\r\nmarched with reduced numbers in ordinary civilian garb. From that time\r\nthe society contented itself with civilian costume until 1825, when its\r\nparades ceased.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the political parties to the war had the effect\r\nof making Tammany Hall the predominant force in the State, and of\r\ndisorganizing the Federalist party beyond hope of recovery. Tammany\r\nbegan in 1813 to organize for the control of the State and to put\r\ndown for all time De Witt Clinton, whom it denounced as having tried\r\nto paralyze the energies of Madison’s administration. Meanwhile\r\nthe Federalist leaders in the city, with a singular lack of tact,\r\nwere constantly offending the popular feeling with their political\r\ndoctrines and their haughty airs of superior citizenship. To such an\r\nextent was this carried that at times they were mobbed, as on June 29,\r\n1814, for celebrating the return of the Bourbons to the French throne.\r\n\r\nThe organization of Tammany Hall, begun, as has been seen, by the\r\nformation of the general, nominating and correspondence committees,\r\nin 1806 and 1808, was now further elaborated. A finance committee,\r\nwhose duty it was to gather for the leaders a suitable campaign fund,\r\nwas created, and this was followed by the creation of the Republican\r\nYoung Men’s General Committee,[5] which was a sort of auxiliary to the\r\ngeneral committee, having limited powers, and serving as a province\r\nfor the ambitions of the young men. The Democratic-Republican General\r\nCommittee was supposed to comprise only the trusted ward leaders, ripe\r\nwith years and experience. About the beginning of the War of 1812, it\r\nadded to its duties the issuing of long public addresses on political\r\ntopics. These general committees were made self-perpetuating. At the\r\nclose of every year they would issue a notice to the voters when and\r\nwhere to meet for the election of their successors. No sooner did\r\nthe committee of one year step out than the newly elected committee\r\ninstantly took its place. There were also ward or vigilance committees,\r\nwhich were expected to bring every Tammany-Republican voter to the\r\npolls, to see that no Federalist intimidation was attempted and\r\nto campaign for the party. The Tammany Hall organization was in a\r\nsuperb state by the year 1814, and in active operation ceaselessly.\r\nThe Federalists, on the contrary, were scarcely organized, and the\r\nClintonites had declined to a mere faction.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany leaders, moreover, were shrewd and conciliating. About\r\nforty Federalists--disgusted, they said, with their party’s opposition\r\nto the war--joined the Tammany Society. They were led by Gulian C.\r\nVerplanck, who severely assailed Clinton, much to the Wigwam’s delight.\r\nTammany Hall not only received them with warmth, but advanced nearly\r\nall of them, such as Jacob Radcliff, Richard Hadfelt, Richard Riker\r\nand Hugh Maxwell, to the first public positions. This was about the\r\nbeginning of that policy, never since abandoned, by which Tammany Hall\r\nhas frequently broken up opposing parties or factions. The winning over\r\nof leaders from the other side and conferring upon them rewards in the\r\nform of profitable public office or contracts has been one of the most\r\nnotable methods of Tammany’s diplomacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _MS.

The Common Council and its\r\ndependent offices since 1809 had been more or less under Federalist\r\nrule, and from the beginning of the century the city had had a\r\nsuccession of Clintonite office-holders in those posts controlled by\r\nthe Council of Appointment.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the War of 1812 the population of the city approached\r\n100,000, and there were 13,941 voters in all. The total expenses of\r\nthe municipality reached a little over a million dollars. The city had\r\nbut one public school, which was maintained by public subscription.\r\nWater was supplied chiefly by the Manhattan Company, by means of bored\r\nwooden logs laid underground from the reservoir in Chambers street. No\r\nfire department was dreamed of, and every blaze had the city at its\r\nmercy. The streets were uncleaned; only two or three thoroughfares were\r\nfit for the passage of carriages, though until 1834 the law required\r\nthe inhabitants to clean the streets in front of their houses. Many\r\nof those elaborate departments which we now associate with political\r\ncontrol were then either in an embryo state or not thought of.\r\n\r\nThe Aldermen were not overburdened with public anxieties. No salary\r\nwas attached to the office, yet none the less, it was sought\r\nindustriously. In early days it was regarded as a post of honor and\r\nfilled as such, but with the beginning of the century it was made a\r\nmeans of profit. The professional politician of the type of to-day was\r\nrare. The Aldermen had business, as a rule, upon which they depended\r\nand to which they attended in the day, holding sessions of the board\r\nsporadically at night. The only exception to this routine was when\r\nthe Alderman performed some judicial office. Under the law, as soon\r\nas an Alderman entered office he became a judge of some of the most\r\nimportant courts, being obliged to preside with the Mayor at the\r\ntrial of criminals. This system entailed upon the Aldermen the trial\r\nof offenses against laws many of which they themselves made, and it\r\nhad an increasingly pernicious influence upon politics. Otherwise the\r\nsole legal perquisites and compensation of the Aldermen consisted in\r\ntheir power and custom of making appropriations, including those for\r\nelaborate public dinners for themselves. It was commonly known that\r\nthey awarded contracts for city necessaries either to themselves or to\r\ntheir relatives.\r\n\r\nThe backward state of the city, its filthy and neglected condition and\r\nthe chaotic state of public improvements and expenditures, excited\r\nlittle public discussion. The Common Councils were composed of men of\r\ninferior mind. It is told of one of them that hearing that the King of\r\nFrance had taken umbrage he ran home post haste to get his atlas and\r\nfind out the location of that particular spot. In the exclusive charge\r\nof such a body New York City would have struggled along but slowly had\r\nit not been for the courage and genius of the man who at one stroke\r\nstarted it on a dazzling career of prosperity. This was De Witt Clinton.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did a Republican Council of Appointment step into office,\r\nearly in 1815, than Tammany Hall pressed for the removal of Clinton\r\nas Mayor and announced that John Ferguson, the Grand Sachem of the\r\nSociety, would have to be appointed in his place.[1] The Council, at\r\nthe head of which was Gov. Tompkins, wavered and delayed, Tompkins\r\nnot caring to offend the friends of Clinton by the latter’s summary\r\nremoval. At this the entire Tammany representation, which had gone\r\nto Albany for the purpose, grew furious and threatened that not only\r\nwould they nominate no ticket the next Spring, but would see that none\r\nof their friends should accept office under the Council, did it fail\r\nto remove Clinton. This action implied the turning out of the Council\r\nof Appointment at the next election. Yielding to these menaces, the\r\nCouncil removed Clinton. Then by a compromise, Ferguson was made Mayor\r\nuntil the National Government should appoint him Naval Officer when\r\nJacob Radcliff (Mayor 1810-1811) was to succeed him--an arrangement\r\nwhich was carried out.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Wigwam was overjoyed at having struck down Clinton, and now\r\nexpected many years of supremacy. From youth Clinton’s sole occupation\r\nhad been politics. He had spent his yearly salaries and was deeply\r\nin debt. His political aspirations seemed doomed. Stripped, as he\r\nappeared, of a party or even a fraction of one, the Sachems felt sure\r\nof his retirement to private life forever. In this belief they were as\r\nmuch animated by personal as by political enmity. Clinton had sneered\r\nat or ridiculed nearly all of them, and he spoke of them habitually in\r\nwithering terms.\r\n\r\nBesides, to enlarge their power in the city they needed the Mayor’s\r\noffice. The Mayor had the right to appoint a Deputy Mayor from\r\namong the Aldermen, the Deputy Mayor acting with full power in his\r\nabsence. The Mayor could convene the Common Council, and he appointed\r\nand licensed marshals, porters, carriers, cartmen, carmen, cryers,\r\nscullers and scavengers, and removed them at pleasure. He licensed\r\ntavern-keepers and all who sold excisable liquors by retail. The Mayor,\r\nthe Deputy Mayor, Recorder and Aldermen were ex-officio Justices of\r\nthe Peace, and were empowered to hold Courts of General Sessions. The\r\nMayor, Recorder and Aldermen were also Justices of Oyer and Terminer;\r\nand the Mayor, Deputy Mayor and Recorder could preside over the Court\r\nof Common Pleas with or without the Aldermen. The gathering of all this\r\npower into its own control gave further strength to Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nBut the expressions of regret at Clinton’s removal were so spontaneous\r\nand sincere that Tammany feigned participation in them and took the\r\nutmost pains to represent the removal as only a political exigency. The\r\nCommon Council (which was now Federalist) passed, on March 21, 1815, a\r\nvote of thanks to Clinton for his able administration.[3] Curiously,\r\nthe very Wigwam men who had made it their business to undertake the\r\ntedious travel over bad roads to Albany to effect his removal (Aldermen\r\nSmith, George Buckmaster, Mann and Burtis) voted loudest in favor of\r\nthe resolution.\r\n\r\nOut of office, Clinton found time to agitate for the building of a\r\nnavigable canal between the great western lakes and the tide waters\r\nof the Hudson. The idea of this enterprise was not original with him.\r\nIt had been suggested over thirty years before, but it was he who\r\ncarried it forward to success. The bigotry and animus with which it\r\nwas assailed were amazing. Tammany Hall frequently passed resolutions\r\ndenouncing the project as impracticable and chimerical, declaring that\r\nthe canal would make a ditch fit to bury its author in. At Albany the\r\nTammany representatives greeted the project with a burst of mockery,\r\nand placed obstacle after obstacle in its path.\r\n\r\nIn the intervals of warring upon Clinton, Tammany was adroitly seizing\r\nevery post of vantage in the city. The Burr men ruled its councils and\r\ndirected the policy and nominations of the Republican, or, as it was\r\ngetting to be more generally known, the Democratic-Republican party.\r\nThree men, in particular, were foremost as leaders--George Buckmaster,\r\na boat builder; Roger Strong and Benjamin Prince, a druggist and\r\nphysician. Teunis Wortman, one of the energetic leaders in 1807-10,\r\nwas now not quite so conspicuous. What the Wigwam lacked to make\r\nits rule in the city complete was a majority in the Common Council.\r\nThe committees of the Council not only had the exclusive power of\r\nexpenditures, but they invariably refused an acceptable accounting.[4]\r\nThe Federalists, though vanishing as a party owing to their attitude\r\nin the recent war, still managed, through local dissensions among the\r\nRepublicans, to retain control of the Common Council. The Federalists,\r\ntherefore, held the key to the purse. It had always been customary for\r\nthe Mayor to appoint the Common Council committees from the party which\r\nhappened to be dominant.\r\n\r\nEstablished forms meant nothing to Mayor Radcliff and to Buckmaster[5]\r\nand other Tammany Aldermen, who late in December, 1815, decided to turn\r\nout the Federalist chairmen of committees and put Tammany men in their\r\nplaces. Radcliff imprudently printed a handbill of officers he intended\r\nappointing, copies of which he sent to his partizans. A copy fell into\r\na Federalist’s hands. At the next meeting, before the Mayor could get a\r\nchance to act, the Federalist majority altered the rules so as to vest\r\nin future the appointment of all committees in a majority of the board.\r\nThe Sachems were so enraged at Radcliff’s bungling that they declared\r\nthey would have him removed from office. About a year afterward they\r\ncarried out their threat.\r\n\r\nIn 1816 Tammany elected not only its Congress and Assembly ticket, but\r\na Common Council, by over 1000 majority out of 9000 votes. This victory\r\nwas the result of the wily policy of further disrupting the Federalist\r\nparty by nominating its most popular men. Walter Bowne, a late\r\nFederalist, an enemy of Clinton and a man of standing in the community,\r\nwas one of those nominated by Tammany Hall for State Senator, and the\r\nsupport of the wealthy was solicited by the selection of men of their\r\nown class, such as Col. Rutgers, said to be the richest man in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nMost of Tammany’s early members, certainly the leaders, were now rich\r\nand had stepped into the upper middle class; but their wealth could\r\nnot quite secure them admittance to that stiff aristocracy above them,\r\nwhich demanded something more of a passport than the possession of\r\nmoney. Another body of members were the small tradesmen and the like,\r\nto whom denunciations of the aristocracy were extremely palatable. A\r\nthird class, that of the mechanics and laborers, believed that Tammany\r\nHall exclusively represented them in its onslaughts on the aristocracy.\r\nFrom the demands of these various interests arose the singular sight\r\nof Tammany Hall winning the support of the rich by systematically\r\ncatering to them; of the middle class, which it reflected, and of the\r\npoor, in whose interests it claimed to work. The spirit of the Tammany\r\nSociety was well illustrated in its odd address on public affairs in\r\n1817, wherein it lamented the spread of the foreign game of billiards\r\namong the aristocratic youth and the prevalence of vice among the\r\nlower classes. Again, in May, 1817, the Tammany majority of the Common\r\nCouncil, under pressure from the religious element, passed an ordinance\r\nfining every person $5 who should hunt, shoot, fish, spar or play on\r\nSunday--a law which cut off from the poor their favorite pastimes.\r\n\r\nHere, too, another of the secrets by which the organization was enabled\r\nto thrive, should be mentioned. This was the “regularity” of its\r\nnominations. Teunis Wortman, a few years before, had disclosed the\r\nreal substance of the principle of “regularity” when he wrote: “The\r\nnominating power is an omnipotent one. Though it approaches us in the\r\nhumble attitude of the _recommendation_, its influence is irresistible.\r\nEvery year’s experience demonstrates that its recommendations are\r\ncommands. That instead of presenting a choice it deprives us of all\r\noption.”[6] The plain meaning was that, regardless of the candidate’s\r\ncharacter, the mass of the party would vote for him once he happened\r\nto be put forth on the “regular” ticket. Fully alive to the value of\r\nthis particular power, the Tammany Hall General Committee, successively\r\nand unfailingly, would invite in its calls for all meetings “those\r\nfriendly to regular nominations.” Its answer to charges of dictatorship\r\nwas plain and direct. Discipline was necessary, its leaders said, to\r\nprevent aristocrats from disrupting their party by inciting a variety\r\nof nominations.\r\n\r\nIt was through this fertile agency that “bossism” became an easy\r\npossibility. With the voters in such a receptive state of mind it\r\nwas not difficult to dictate nominations. The general committee was\r\ncomposed of thirty members; its meetings were secret and attended\r\nseldom by more than fourteen members. So, substantially, fourteen\r\nmen were acting for over five thousand Republican voters, and eight\r\nmembers of the fourteen composed a majority. Yet the system had all the\r\npretense of being pure democracy; the wards were called upon at regular\r\nintervals to elect delegates; the latter chose candidates or made party\r\nrules; and the “great popular meeting” accepted or rejected nominees;\r\nit all seemed to spring directly from the people.\r\n\r\nThis exquisitely working machine was in full order when the\r\norganization secured a firm hold upon the city in 1816. The newly\r\nelected Common Council removed every Federalist possible and put a\r\nstanch Tammany man in his place. The Federalist Captains of Police\r\nand the heads and subordinates of many departments whose appointments\r\nand removal were vested in the Common Council were all ejected. This\r\nfrequent practice of changes in the police force, solely because of\r\npolitical considerations, had a demoralizing effect upon the welfare of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nBoth parties were as responsible for this state of affairs as they were\r\nfor the increase in the city’s debt. To provide revenue the Aldermen\r\nrepeatedly caused to be sold ground owned by the municipality in the\r\nheart of the city. This was one of their clumsy or fraudulent methods\r\nof concealing the squandering of city funds, on what no one knew. They\r\nwere not ignorant that with the growth of the city the value of the\r\nland would increase vastly. It was perhaps for this very reason they\r\nsold it; for it was generally themselves or the Tammany leaders who\r\nwere the buyers. One sale was of land fronting Bowling Green, among the\r\npurchasers being John Swartwout, Jacob Barker and John Sharpe. A hint\r\nas to the fraudulent ways in which the Tammany leaders became rich is\r\nfurnished by a report made to the Common Council respecting land in\r\nHamilton Square, bought from the city by Jacob Barker, John S. Hunn and\r\nothers. The report stated that repeated applications for the payment\r\nof principal and interest had been made without effect.[7]\r\n\r\nBy 1817 the Federalists in New York City were crushed, quite beyond\r\nhope of resurrection as a winning party. The only remaining fear was\r\nClinton, whose political death the organization celebrated prematurely.\r\nPublic opinion was one factor Tammany had not conquered.\r\n\r\nThis inclined more and more daily to the support of Clinton.\r\nNotwithstanding all the opposition which narrow-mindedness and hatred\r\ncould invent, Clinton’s grand project of the Erie Canal became\r\npopular--distinctively so throughout the State, then so greatly\r\nagricultural. On April 15, 1817, the bill pledging the State to the\r\nbuilding of the canal became a law, the Tammany delegation and all\r\ntheir friends voting against it.\r\n\r\nGov. Tompkins becoming Vice-President, a special election to fill the\r\ngubernatorial vacancy became necessary. A new and powerful junction\r\nof Clinton’s old friends and the disunited Federalists joined in\r\nnominating him to succeed Tompkins. This was bitter news to Tammany,\r\nwhich made heroic efforts to defeat him, nominating as its candidate\r\nPeter B. Porter, and sending tickets with his name into every county in\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nInopportunely for the Wigwam, the resentment of the Irish broke out\r\nagainst it at this time. Tammany’s long-continued refusal to give\r\nthe Irish proper representation among its nominations, either in the\r\nsociety or for public office, irritated them greatly. On February 7,\r\na writer in a newspaper over the signature “Connal,” averred in an\r\nopen letter to Matthew L. Davis that on the evening of February 3,\r\nthe Tammany Society had considered a resolution for the adoption of\r\na new constitution, the object of which was to exclude foreigners\r\nentirely from holding office in the society. This may not have been\r\nstrictly true, but the anti-foreign feeling in the organization was\r\nunquestionably strong. The Irish had sought, some time before, to have\r\nthe organization nominate for Congress Thomas Addis Emmett, an Irish\r\norator and patriot and an ardent friend of Clinton. As Tammany Hall\r\nsince 1802 had not only invariably excommunicated all Clintonites,\r\nbut had broken up such Clinton meetings as were held, this demand was\r\nrefused without discussion. The Irish grew to regard Tammany Hall as\r\nthe home of bigotry; the Wigwam, in turn, was resolved not to alienate\r\nthe prejudiced native support by recognizing foreigners; furthermore,\r\nthe Irish were held to be Clintonites trying to get into Tammany Hall\r\nand control it.\r\n\r\nThe long-smouldering enmity burst out on the night of April 24, 1817,\r\nwhen the general committee was in session. Two hundred Irishmen,\r\nassembled at Dooley’s Long Room, marched in rank to the Wigwam and\r\nbroke into the meeting room. The intention of their leaders was\r\nto impress upon the committee the wisdom of nominating Emmett for\r\nCongress, as well as other Irish Catholics on the Tammany ticket in\r\nfuture, but the more fiery spirits at once started a fight. Eyes were\r\nblackened, noses and heads battered freely. The invaders broke the\r\nfurniture, using it for weapons and shattering it maliciously; tore\r\ndown the fixtures and shivered the windows. Reinforcements arriving,\r\nthe intruders were driven out, but not before nearly all present had\r\nbeen bruised and beaten.[8]\r\n\r\nClinton received an overwhelming majority for Governor, Porter\r\nobtaining a ridiculously small vote in both New York City and the rest\r\nof the State.[9] Thus in the feud between Tammany Hall and DeWitt\r\nClinton, the latter, lacking a political machine and basing his contest\r\nsolely on a political idea--that of internal improvements--emerged\r\ntriumphant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Hammond, Vol. I, p. 399.\r\n\r\n[2] Valentine in his _Manual of the Common Council of New York_, for\r\n1842-44, p. 163, states that Ferguson held on to both offices until\r\nPresident Monroe required him to say which office he preferred.\r\nFerguson soon after resigned the Mayoralty. He held the other post\r\nuntil his death in 1832.\r\n\r\n[3] _MS. Minutes of the Common Council_, Vol. 29, p. 150.\r\n\r\n[4] As late as July 28, 1829, the Common Council refused such an\r\naccounting. Charles King, a prominent citizen, memorialized the\r\nCouncil, through Alderman Lozier, to furnish an itemized statement of\r\nthe expenditure of over half a million dollars for the previous fiscal\r\nyear. By a vote of 15 to 6 the Council refused to grant the request. A\r\npublic agitation on the question following, the board later rescinded\r\nits action, and supplied the statement.\r\n\r\n[5] Buckmaster had a record. On October 9, 1815, the Common Council\r\npassed a secret resolution to sell $440,000 of United States bonds\r\nit held at 97--the stock being then under par. About $30,000 worth\r\nwas disposed of at that figure, when the officials found that not a\r\ndollar’s worth more could be sold. Investigation followed. Gould Hoyt\r\nproved that Buckmaster had disclosed the secret to certain Wall street\r\nmen, who, taking advantage of the city’s plight, forced the sale of the\r\nstock at 95. Buckmaster was chairman of the general committee in 1815\r\nand at other times, and chairman of the nominating committee in 1820.\r\n\r\n[6] _New York Public Advertiser_, April 13, 1809. This journal was\r\nsecretly supported for a time by the funds of the Tammany Society.\r\n\r\n[7] _MS. Minutes of the Common Council_, Vol. 18, p. 359.\r\n\r\n[8] _The National Advocate_, May 10, asserted that the Irish entered\r\nTammany Hall, shouting “Down with the Natives!” but the assertion was\r\ndenied.\r\n\r\n[9] Clinton’s vote was nearly 44,000; Porter’s not quite 1,400.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nCLINTON MAINTAINS HIS SUPREMACY\r\n\r\n1817-1820\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Gov. Clinton at the head of the Council of Appointment, Tammany\r\nmen expected the force of his vengeance. They were not disappointed. He\r\nremoved many of them for no other reason than that they belonged to the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nHoping to make terms with him, the Wigwam Assemblymen, early in 1818,\r\npresented to the Council of Appointment a petition praying for the\r\nremoval of Mayor Radcliff and the appointment in his place of William\r\nPaulding, Jr. “Radcliff,” the paper read, “is an unfit person longer\r\nto fill that honorable and respectful office.” Clinton smiled at this\r\nambidexterity. It was rumored that he intended to award the honor to\r\nCadwallader D. Colden, a Federalist supporter of the War of 1812, and\r\none of the Federalists Tammany Hall had sent to the Assembly in 1817,\r\nas a means of breaking up that party. Colden now let it be understood\r\nthat he sided with Clinton.\r\n\r\nThe whole Tammany delegation lived in a single house at Albany and\r\nmet in a large room, No. 10, in Eagle Tavern. “This system of acting\r\nas a separate body,” admitted Tammany’s own organ,[1] “was very\r\ninjudicious to our city. It created suspicion and distrust among\r\ncountry members; it looked like a separate interest; a combination of\r\na powerful delegation to frown down or overpower the delegation of a\r\nsmaller county.” Colden did not join in these nightly meetings. One\r\nday he was coaxed in to take a glass of wine. To his surprise, upon\r\nopening the door of No. 10, he found the delegation in caucus. The\r\nmeeting seemed to be waiting for him before transacting business. He\r\nhad scarcely taken a seat, when one of the members arose, and in a long\r\nspeech protested against any member of the city delegation accepting\r\nan office, and suggested that each member should pledge himself not\r\nto do so. Colden saw at once that the resolution was directed against\r\nhimself. He exclaimed energetically against the trickery, declaring\r\nthat he had not asked for the office of Mayor, but would accept it if\r\noffered. The meeting broke up; Colden was appointed Mayor, and Tammany\r\nHall from that time denounced him.\r\n\r\nIn Albany, Clinton was vigorously pushing forward the Erie Canal\r\nproject; the Tammany men were as aggressively combatting it.[2] While\r\nClinton was thus absorbed in this great public enterprise the Wigwam\r\nwas enriching its leaders in manifold ways. An instance of this was\r\nthe noted Barker episode. Jacob Barker was a Sachem, a leader of\r\ngreat influence in the political organization, and such a power in\r\nfinancial and business circles that at one time he defied the United\r\nStates Bank. He and Matthew L. Davis were Burr’s firmest friends to\r\nthe hour of Burr’s death. Early in 1818 a bill prohibiting private\r\nbanking, prepared at the instance of the incorporated banks, which\r\nsought a monopoly, passed the Senate; though as a special favor to\r\nBarker the Senate exempted from its provisions the latter’s Exchange\r\nBank for three years. But Barker desired an indefinite lease. To create\r\na show of public sentiment he had the hall packed with his friends\r\nand creatures on April 14, when resolutions were passed stating that\r\nthe proposed bill would destroy all competition with the incorporated\r\nbanks, “benefit the rich, oppress the poor, extend the power of\r\nexisting aristocracies, and terminate the banking transactions of an\r\nindividual whose loans have been highly advantageous to many laborious\r\nand industrious mechanics and neighboring farmers.” The Legislature\r\ngranted the privileges Barker asked. A few years later (1826) the\r\nsequel to this legislative favoritism appeared in the form of one of\r\nthe most sensational trials witnessed in early New York.\r\n\r\nThe year 1818 saw Tammany Hall in the unusual position of advocating\r\na protective tariff. The War of 1812 having injured domestic\r\nmanufacturing, the demand for such a measure was general. Party\r\nasperity had softened, and Republicans, or Democrats--as they were\r\ncoming to be known--and Federalists alike favored it. The society made\r\nthe best of this popular wave. It issued an address, advising moderate\r\nprotective duties on foreign goods. But New York then, and until after\r\nthe Civil War, was a great shipbuilding center; and the shipbuilders\r\nand owners and the importing merchants soon influenced Tammany to\r\nrevert to the stanch advocacy of free trade.\r\n\r\nThe almost complete extinction of national party lines under Monroe\r\ncaused the disappearance of violent partizan recriminations and brought\r\nmunicipal affairs more to public attention. From 1817 onward public\r\nbodies agitated much more forcibly and persistently than before for\r\nthe correction of certain local evils. Chief among these were the high\r\ntaxes. In 1817 the city tax levy was $180,000; in 1818 it rose to\r\n$250,000, “an enormous amount,” one newspaper said. Though the city\r\nreceived annually $200,000 in rents from houses and lots, for wharves,\r\nslips and piers, and also a considerable amount from fines, yet there\r\nwas a constantly increasing deficit. The city expenses were thought\r\nto be too slight to devour the ordinary revenue. The Democratic, or\r\nTammany, officials made attempts to explain that much of the debt was\r\ncontracted under Federalist Common Councils, and said that sufficient\r\nmoney must be provided or “the poor would starve.”\r\n\r\nAt almost the identical time this plea was entered, E. C. Genet\r\nwas laying before the Grand Jury a statement to this effect: that\r\nalthough it was known that the aggregate capital of the incorporated\r\nbanks, insurance and commission companies in New York City, exclusive\r\nof one branch of the United States Bank, amounted in 1817 to about\r\n$22,000,000, in addition to the shares in those companies, yet the city\r\nand States taxes combined “on all that vast personal estate in New York\r\nCity are only a paltry $97,000.”\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the blindness of the Wigwam officials to the escape\r\nof the rich from taxation is simple. The Tammany Hall of 1818 was not\r\nthe Tammany Hall of 1800. In that interval the poor young men who once\r\nhad to club together in order to vote had become directors in banking,\r\ninsurance and various other corporations, which as members of the\r\nLegislature or as city officials they themselves had helped to form.\r\nBeing such, they exerted all the influence of their political machinery\r\nto save their property from taxation. From about 1805 to 1837 Tammany\r\nHall was ruled directly by about one-third bankers, one-third merchants\r\nand the remaining third politicians of various pursuits. The masses\r\nformed--except at rare times--the easily wielded body. The leaders\r\nsafeguarded their own interests at every point, however they might\r\nprofess at election times an abhorrence of the aristocracy; and the\r\nGrand Jury being of them, ignored Genet’s complaint.\r\n\r\nA new series of revelations concerning the conduct of Tammany\r\nchieftains was made public during 1817-18. Ruggles Hubbard, a one-time\r\nSachem and at the time Sheriff of the county, absconded from the city\r\nAugust 15, 1817, leaving a gap in the treasury.[3] John L. Broome,\r\nanother Sachem, was shortly after removed from the office of City\r\nClerk by the Council of Appointment for having neglected to take the\r\nnecessary securities from Hubbard. John P. Haff, a one-time Grand\r\nSachem and long a power in the organization, was removed by President\r\nMonroe on November 14, 1818, from the office of Surveyor of the Port,\r\nfor corruption and general unfitness.[4]\r\n\r\nBut the most sensational of these exposures was that concerning the\r\nswindling of the Medical Science Lottery, by which Naphtali Judah[5]\r\nand others profited handsomely. The testimony brought out before Mayor\r\nColden, November 10, 1818, showed that a corrupt understanding existed\r\nbetween Judah and one of the lottery’s managers, by which the former\r\nwas enabled to have a knowledge of the state of the wheel. Not less\r\nthan $100,000 was drawn on the first day, of which Judah received\r\na large share. Further affidavits were submitted tending to show a\r\ncorrupt understanding between Judah and Alderman Isaac Denniston in the\r\ndrawing of the Owego Lottery, by which Denniston won $35,000. John L.\r\nBroome was also implicated in the scandal, and Teunis Wortman, while\r\nnot directly concerned in it, was considered involved by the public,\r\nand suffered a complete loss of popular favor,[6] though retaining\r\nfor some time a certain degree of influence in the society and\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nAlways as popular criticism began to assert itself, Tammany would\r\nmake a sudden display of patriotism, accompanied by the pronouncement\r\nof high-sounding toasts and other exalted utterances. Such it did in\r\n1817, when the society took part in the interment of the remains of\r\nGen. Montgomery in St. Paul’s Church. And now the Sachems prepared to\r\nentertain Andrew Jackson at a banquet, and also indirectly signify\r\nthat he was their choice for President. William Mooney, again elected\r\nGrand Sachem, sent to Gen. Jackson, under date of February 15, 1819, a\r\ngrandiloquent letter of invitation which, referring to the battle of\r\nNew Orleans, said in part:\r\n\r\n    “Columbia’s voice, in peals of iron thunder, proclaimed the\r\n    dread fiat of that eventful morn! Terra was drenched with human\r\n    gore! The perturbed elements were hushed! Mars and Bellona\r\n    retired from the ensanguined field! and godlike Hera resumed\r\n    her gentle reign.… We approbate your noble deeds and greet you\r\n    hero. Scourge of British insolence, Spanish perfidy and Indian\r\n    cruelty--these, sir, are the sentiments of the Sons of Liberty\r\n    in New York who compose the National Institution of Tammany\r\n    Society No. 1 of the United States. Here, sir, we guard the\r\n    patriot flame--‘preserved by concord’--its effulgence, in a\r\n    blaze of glory, shall surround and accompany you to the temple\r\n    of interminable fame and honor.”\r\n\r\nJackson accepted the invitation. Cadwallader D. Colden, who had been\r\nreappointed Mayor a few days before, was asked to preside. When, on\r\nFebruary 23, the banquet was held and Jackson was called for his toast,\r\nColden arose, and to the consternation of the Tammany men proposed:\r\n“De Witt Clinton, the Governor of the great and patriotic State of New\r\nYork.” This surprising move made it appear that Jackson favored the\r\nClinton party. To counteract the impression, the General instantly\r\nleft the room, “amidst reiterated applauses,” and a dead silence ensued\r\nfor three minutes. This incident, it may well be believed, did not\r\ndampen the society’s enthusiasm for Jackson; it continued to champion\r\nhim ardently.\r\n\r\nColden was reappointed Mayor for the third time in February, 1820.\r\nMunicipal issues were dividing the public consideration with Tammany’s\r\nrenewed efforts to overthrow Clinton. The report of the Common Council\r\nFinance Committee, January 10, 1820, showed that the city would soon\r\nbe $1,300,000 in debt. An attempt was made to show how the money had\r\nbeen spent on the new City Hall and Bellevue Hospital, but it proved\r\nnothing. Although the law expressly prohibited Aldermen from being\r\ndirectly or indirectly interested in any contract or job, violations\r\nwere common. It was alleged that streets were sunk, raised and sunk\r\nagain, to enable the contractors to make large claims against the city.\r\nTo soothe public clamor, the Aldermen made a show of reducing city\r\nexpenses. The salary of Colden--he being a Clintonite--was reduced\r\n$2,500, and the pay of various other city officers was cut down. The\r\nsalaries of the Wigwam men were not interfered with.\r\n\r\nThe wholesome criticism of municipal affairs was soon obscured again\r\nby the reviving tumult of the contest between Tammany and Clinton. The\r\nGovernor stood for reelection against Daniel D. Tompkins in April,\r\n1820. Tompkins had long been the idol of the Tammany men and for a\r\ntime was one of the society’s Sachems. In 1818 he had been practically\r\ncharged with being a public defaulter. State Controller Archibald\r\nM’Intyre submitted to the Legislature a mass of his vouchers, public\r\nand private (for the time Tompkins was Governor), which showed a\r\nbalance against him of $197,297.64. In this balance, however, was\r\nincluded the sum of $142,763.60 which was not allowed to Tompkins’s\r\ncredit because the vouchers were insufficient. Allowing Tompkins this\r\namount, the balance against him was $54,533.44. Tompkins, on the other\r\nhand, claimed the State owed him $120,000. His partisans in the Senate\r\nin 1819 passed a bill to re-imburse him, but it was voted down in the\r\nAssembly.[7]\r\n\r\nThe statements of both sides during the campaign of 1820 were filled\r\nwith epithets and strings of accusations. Tammany contrasted Clinton’s\r\nalleged going over to the British with Tompkins’s patriotism in the\r\nWar of 1812. Party lines were broken down, and Federalists and Tammany\r\nmen acted together, as they had done the year before (1819), when\r\ntheir Legislative ticket won over the Clintonites by 2,500 majority.\r\nThe Clintonites were tauntingly invited to visit the Wigwam, because\r\nin that “stronghold of Democracy would be found no ‘Swiss’ Federalism,\r\nno British partizans, no opponents of the late war, no bribers or\r\nbribed for bank charters, no trimming politicians, no lobby members\r\nor legislative brokers.” In Tammany Hall they would see a body of\r\nindependent yeomen, of steady and unerring Republicans and men who\r\nrallied around their country in the hour of danger.[8]\r\n\r\nWhile Clinton’s adherents in New York City on election day were\r\ninactive, his opponents, ever on the lookout, carried the city by 675\r\nmajority. The popularity of the Erie Canal, however, which was fast\r\nnearing completion, carried the rest of the State for Clinton.[9]\r\n“Heads up! tails down,” shouted the exuberant, successful Clintonites\r\nsome days after, pointing to the disappointed, discomfited Bucktails.\r\nFor Tammany had been so sure of Tompkins’s election that it had\r\nprocured, at considerable expense, a painting of him which was to be\r\nexhibited in the hall when the news of his election should arrive. By\r\nway of consolation the Sachems drank to this toast at their anniversary\r\non May 12:\r\n\r\n    “De Witt Clinton, our lean Governor--\r\n      ---- May he never get fat,\r\n    While he wears two faces under one hat.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _National Advocate_, October 7, 1822. A circumstantial account of\r\nthe meeting referred to on the following page appears in this issue.\r\nThe paper was edited and owned by M. M. Noah, who became Grand Sachem\r\nin 1824.\r\n\r\n[2] Hammond, Vol. I, p. 450.\r\n\r\n[3] In what year Hubbard was Sachem is uncertain. His name is included\r\nin Horton’s list. He was one of the chiefs in the nominating committee\r\nfrom 1815 to 1817. It is worthy of note that only a short time before\r\nhis flight a committee of the Common Council had examined his accounts\r\nand approved them as correct.\r\n\r\n[4] That Haff was removed is certain, though the author has been unable\r\nto find a record of the fact in the available papers of the Treasury\r\nDepartment. The Tammany organ, the _National Advocate_, November 19,\r\n1818, commented as follows: “The rumors which, for several days past,\r\nhave been afloat and which we treated as idle and interested, are\r\nconfirmed--Captain Haff has been removed from office.” Many evidences\r\nof public gratification were shown. In one instance, eighty citizens\r\ndragged a field piece from the Arsenal to the Battery and fired a\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n[5] Naphthali Judah had been Sachem of the Maryland tribe in 1808, and\r\ncontinued for some time to be a leader in the party’s councils. He was\r\nagain elected a Sachem in 1819.\r\n\r\n[6] How deeply the people of New York were concerned in lotteries may\r\nbe gathered from the fact that in 1826 there were 190 lottery offices\r\nlegalized by statute in New York City. A saying obtained that “one-half\r\nthe citizens got their living by affording the opportunity of gambling\r\nto the rest.” Many State institutions were in part supported from the\r\nproceeds of the lotteries. These swindles, therefore, became a matter\r\nfor legislative investigation. A great number of pages of the Journal\r\nof the Assembly for 1819 are taken up with the testimony.\r\n\r\n[7] _Journal of the Assembly_, 1819, pp. 222-45, and _Ibid._,\r\npp. 1046-53. Tompkins, now Vice President, made this race for\r\n“vindication.” It is altogether likely that this particular charge\r\nagainst Tompkins was made for political effect in a campaign in which\r\neach side sought to blacken the other by fierce personal attacks.\r\n\r\n[8] _National Advocate_, March 29, 1820.\r\n\r\n[9] Tammany charged that in the construction of the Erie Canal, land\r\nhad been cut up in slips to make additional voters for Clinton and\r\ncited the county of Genesee, which, though polling but 750 freehold\r\nvotes in 1815, gave nearly 5,000 votes in this election.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE SUFFRAGE CONTEST\r\n\r\n1820-1822\r\n\r\n\r\nTammany Hall now entered upon a step destined to change its composition\r\nand career, and greatly affect the political course of the State and\r\nnation.\r\n\r\nFrom its inception the society had declared among its objects the\r\naccomplishment of two special reforms--the securing of manhood suffrage\r\nand the abolition of the law for the imprisonment of debtors. No steps\r\nso far had been taken by either the organization or the society toward\r\nthe promotion of these reforms; first, because the leaders were engaged\r\ntoo busily in the contest for office, and second, because Tammany Hall,\r\nthough professing itself devoted to the welfare of the poor, was,\r\nto repeat, essentially a middle-class institution. Having property\r\nthemselves, the men who controlled and influenced the organization were\r\nwell satisfied with the laws under which Tammany had grown powerful\r\nand they rich; they could not see why so blissful a state of affairs\r\nshould be changed for something the outcome of which was doubtful. The\r\nfarmer, the independent blacksmith, the shoemaker with an apprentice\r\nor two, the grocer--these had votes, and though they looked with envy\r\non the aristocratic class above them, yet they were not willing that\r\nthe man with the spade should be placed on a political equality with\r\nthemselves. In addition, most of the aristocratic rich were opposed\r\nto these reforms, and the Tammany leaders were either ambitious to\r\nenter that class or desirous of not estranging it. Lastly, the lower\r\nclasses had sided with Clinton generally; they regarded him as their\r\nbest friend; to place the ballot unrestrictedly in their hands, Tammany\r\nHall reckoned, would be fatuous. As to the debtors’ law, the tradesmen\r\nthat thronged Tammany were only too well satisfied with a statute that\r\nallowed them to throw their debtors, no matter for how small an amount,\r\ninto jail indefinitely.\r\n\r\nAgitation for these two reforms, begun by a few radicals, gradually\r\nmade headway with the public. The demand for manhood suffrage made\r\nthe greater progress, until in 1820 it overshadowed all other\r\nquestions. The movement took an such force and popularity that Tammany\r\nHall was forced, for its own preservation, to join. Agreeable to\r\ninstructions, the _National Advocate_, September 13, 1820, began to\r\nurge the extension of the right of suffrage and the abolition of\r\nthose cumbersome relics of old centralizing methods, the Council of\r\nAppointment and the Council of Revision--the latter a body passing\r\nfinally on all laws enacted by the Legislature. On October 7, a meeting\r\nof Democrats from all parts of the State was held in the Wigwam,\r\nStephen Allen presiding, and the Legislature was called upon to provide\r\nfor a constitutional convention for the adoption of the amendments.\r\n\r\nThe aristocracy and all the powers at its command assailed the proposed\r\nreforms with passionate bitterness. “Would you admit the populace,\r\nthe patron’s coachman to vote?” asked one Federalist writer. “His\r\nexcellency (the Governor) cannot retain the gentry, the Judges, and\r\nthe ‘manors’ in his interest without he opposes either openly or\r\nclandestinely every attempt to enlarge the elective franchise.” “We\r\nwould rather be ruled by a _man_ without an estate than by an estate\r\nwithout a _man_,” replied one reform writer. The Legislature passed a\r\nbill providing for the holding of a constitutional convention, and the\r\nCouncil of Revision, by the deciding vote of Clinton, promptly rejected\r\nit. Doubtless this action was due to the declared intention of the\r\nadvocates of the constitutional convention to abolish this body. Again\r\nan assemblage gathered at Tammany Hall (December 1) and resolved that\r\nas the “distinction of the electorial rights, the mode of appointment\r\nto office and the union of the judiciary and legislative functions were\r\nobjectional and highly pernicious,” the next Legislature should pass\r\nthe pending bill.\r\n\r\nUpon this issue a Legislature overwhelmingly favorable to the extension\r\nof suffrage and other projected reforms was elected. The aristocratic\r\nparty opened a still fiercer onslaught. But when the Legislature\r\nrepassed the convention bill, the Council of Revision did not dare to\r\nveto it. The convention bill was promptly submitted to the people and\r\nratified. On the news of its success the Democratic voters celebrated\r\nthe event in the Wigwam, June 14, 1821.\r\n\r\nBeaten so far, the Federalists tried to form a union with the\r\nreactionary element in Tammany Hall by which they could elect delegates\r\nopposed to the projected reforms. All opposition was unavailing,\r\nhowever; the reformers had a clear majority in the convention, and\r\nthe new amendments, embodying the reforms, were submitted to the\r\npeople. They were adopted in January, 1822, the city alone giving them\r\n4608 majority.[1] When the Legislature took oath under the revised\r\nconstitution on March 4, the bells of the city churches were rung;\r\nflags were flung on the shipping and public buildings; “a grand salute”\r\nwas fired by a corps of artillery from the Battery; the City Hall was\r\nilluminated at night, and the municipality held a popular reception\r\nthere. In Tammany Hall a gala banquet was spread, one toast of which\r\nran: “The right of suffrage--Corruption in its exercise most to be\r\napprehended from its limitation to a few.” After that pronouncement, so\r\nedifying in view of later developments, came another as instructive:\r\n“The young and rising politician--May integrity and principle guide\r\nhim--studying the public good, not popularity.”\r\n\r\nSo Tammany Hall built for itself a vast political following, which soon\r\nmade it practically invincible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] A considerable increase in the number of voters was made by the\r\nsuffrage reform. The last remnant of the property qualification was\r\nabolished in the State in 1826 by a vote of 104,900 to 3,901.\r\n\r\nThe abolition of the Council of Appointment carried with it a clause\r\nvesting the Appointment of the Mayor in the Common Council. It was\r\nnot until 1834 that the Mayor was elected by the people. By the\r\nConstitutional Amendments the gubernatorial term was changed to two\r\nyears and the election time to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLES OF THE PRESIDENTIAL FACTIONS\r\n\r\n1822-1825\r\n\r\n\r\nInevitably the greater part of the newly created voters gravitated to\r\nTammany Hall, but they did not instantly overrun and rule it.\r\n\r\nA new set of leaders came in view. Wortman and Judah had been forced\r\nfrom public life through the lottery exposures of 1818, and Broome\r\nhad lost prestige. Hubbard had fled; Haff, Buckmaster, Strong and\r\nPrince were no longer powerful, and Jonas Humbert, who until 1820 had\r\nbeen a person of some authority, was now no longer in public notice.\r\nStephen Allen and Mordecai M. Noah, with a following of some of the old\r\nBurrites, were now regarded as being at the helm.\r\n\r\nThe pro-Tammany Council of Appointment chosen late in 1820, before the\r\nnew constitutional amendments were adopted, had removed Colden and\r\nappointed Allen (Grand Sachem about this time) Mayor[1] in his place.\r\nNoah was made Sheriff, and all the other offices were filled with\r\nWigwam men.\r\n\r\nThe new voting element coming into the organization had to be impressed\r\nwith the traditional principle of discipline. Otherwise there might\r\nbe all kinds of nominations, whose effect upon the machine-made\r\n“regular” nominations of the organization would be disastrous, if\r\nnot destructive. To this end the different ward committees passed\r\nresolutions (April 27 and 28, 1822) declaring in nearly identical terms\r\nthat the sense of a majority, fairly expressed, ought always to govern,\r\nand that no party, however actuated by principle, could be truly useful\r\nwithout organization. “Therefore, that the discipline of the Republican\r\nparty, as established and practised for the last twenty-five years,\r\nhas, by experience, been found conducive to the general good and\r\nsuccess of the party.”[2]\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Clinton declined to stand for reelection. Tammany Hall was\r\nconsidered so invincible in the city that the Clintonites and the\r\nremnant of the Federalists refused to nominate contesting candidates\r\nfor Congress and the Legislature. Experience demonstrating that almost\r\nall the voters cast their ballots for the “regular” ticket without\r\nasking questions, competition for a place on that ticket, which now\r\nwas equivalent to election, became sharp. When, on October 30, the\r\nnominating committee reported the name of M. M. Noah for the office\r\nof Sheriff, Benjamin Romaine moved to have that of Peter H. Wendover\r\nsubstituted. Two factors were at work here; one was religious prejudice\r\nagainst Noah, who was a Jew; the other and greater, was the struggle\r\nbetween the partizans of Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams and William\r\nH. Crawford to get control of Tammany Hall, as a necessary preliminary\r\nto the efforts of each for the nomination for President.[3] Romaine was\r\nan Adams supporter and could easily have nominated a ticket independent\r\nof Tammany Hall, but it would have lacked “regularity,” and hence\r\npopular support. A row ensued; and while Noah’s party rushed out of\r\nTammany Hall claiming the “regular” nomination, the other faction, by\r\nthe light of a solitary candle, passed resolutions denouncing Noah and\r\nclaiming that Wendover was the “regular” nominee.\r\n\r\nEach of the candidates put himself before the people, declaring that\r\na majority of the nominating committee favored him as “regular.” The\r\nleaders of the organization inclined to Noah, as one of its heads,\r\nbut Wendover skillfully appealed to Anti-Semitic bigotry and gathered\r\na large following. The Sachems dared not interfere between them, and\r\neach in consequence had a room in Tammany Hall, where his tickets\r\nwere distributed and his agents made their headquarters. Noah was\r\ndefeated at the polls; but his defeat did not impair his influence in\r\nTammany Hall. He was a person of singular ability. A facile writer and\r\neffective manipulator, he maintained his hold.\r\n\r\n“Regularity,” then, was the agency by which the leaders imposed their\r\ncandidates upon the thousands of voters who, from their stores and\r\nbenches, offices and farms, went to the polls to deposit a list of\r\nnames prepared for them. The voters were expected only to vote; the\r\nleaders assumed the burden of determining for whom the voting should be\r\ndone. An instance of the general recognition of this fact was given in\r\n1820 when the counties of Suffolk, Queens, Kings and Dutchess voted to\r\ndiscontinue the practice of holding Senatorial conventions in Tammany\r\nHall because a fair expression of the wishes of a great proportion of\r\nthe Democratic-Republican electors was not obtainable there. At the\r\nsame time, and for years later, complaints were frequent that the ward\r\nmeetings had long since become an object of so little interest that\r\nthey were nearly neglected; and that a small knot of six or eight men\r\nmanaged them for their own purposes.\r\n\r\nIn 1823 attempts were made by different factions to obtain the\r\ninvaluable “regular” nominations. Seemingly a local election, the\r\nreal point turned on whether partisans of Jackson, Adams or Crawford\r\nshould be chosen. Upon this question Tammany Hall was still divided.\r\nThe nominating committee, however, was for Jackson. The voters were\r\nbidden to assemble in the hall at 7 o’clock on the evening of October\r\n30 to hear that committee’s report. When they tried to enter, they\r\nfound the hall occupied by the committee and its friends. This was a\r\nnew departure in Tammany practices. Since the building of the hall\r\nthe nominating committee had always waited in a lower room for the\r\nopening of the great popular meeting, and had then marched up stairs\r\nand reported. To head off expected hostile action by the Adams men, the\r\ncommittee this time started proceedings before the appointed hour. The\r\nnames of its candidates were called and affirmed in haste. Gen. Robert\r\nSwartwout, a corrupt but skillful politician and an Adams supporter,\r\nproposed a substitute list of names, upon which the chairman declared\r\nthat the meeting stood adjourned. A general fist-fight followed, in the\r\nexcitement of which Swartwout took the chair, read off a list of names\r\nand declared it adopted. Epithets, among which “liar” and “traitor”\r\nfigured most, were distributed freely. Both tickets went to the people\r\nunder the claim of “regularity,” and each carried five of the ten wards.\r\n\r\nThough Robert Swartwout[4] was for Adams, another Swartwout (Samuel),\r\nan even shrewder politician, was Jackson’s direct representative in\r\nthe task of securing the organization’s support for President. A third\r\nand less important group were the Crawford advocates. They were led\r\nby Gen. John P. Van Ness, an adroit intriguer and one of the old\r\nBurr chieftains of Tammany. In 1821 Adams, then Secretary of State,\r\nascertaining that Van Ness, as president of the Bank of the Metropolis,\r\nwas indebted to that institution to the amount of $60,000 and that its\r\naffairs were in bad condition, transferred the account of the State\r\nDepartment to another bank. From that time Van Ness bore deep hatred\r\nagainst Adams, and supported Crawford, Secretary of the Treasury, for\r\nPresident. Crawford had deposited as a standing balance with Van Ness\r\nabout the same sum Adams had withdrawn, notwithstanding the bank’s\r\nsuspicious character. The Crawford men went first about the business of\r\nobtaining complete ascendency in the Tammany Society. With that end in\r\nview they tried in 1823 to elect a Grand Sachem favoring Crawford. The\r\nold Burr faction now brought forth a Presidential candidate of its own\r\nin the person of John C. Calhoun, and taking advantage of the absence\r\nof most of the society’s members, dexterously managed to elect William\r\nTodd, a partisan of Calhoun, Grand Sachem.\r\n\r\nThe popular voice for Jackson becoming daily stronger, some of the\r\nAdams leaders changed about. Perhaps having a premonition that Adams\r\nwould be chosen President by the House of Representatives, the general\r\ncommittee of Tammany Hall, on October 3, 1823, resolved that the\r\nelection of President by that branch of Congress was “an event to be\r\ndeprecated,” and that the constitution ought to be so amended as to\r\ngive the election directly to the people without the intervention\r\nof electors. The ward committees passed similar resolutions. This\r\naction was on a line with that of a few years before when the Wigwam,\r\nfearing the nomination of Clinton for Governor by legislative caucus,\r\nrecommended that State nominations be made by a State convention of\r\ndelegates. In the following April (1824) Jackson’s friends filled\r\nTammany Hall and nominated him for President.\r\n\r\nBefore the election came on, however, the organization, in the full\r\nswing of power, again brought public odium upon itself. De Witt\r\nClinton, having filled his gubernatorial term, was now serving in the\r\nmodest post of a Canal Commissioner, without pay and utterly without\r\npolitical power. Yet Tammany carried its hatred of him so far as to\r\ncause the Legislature to remove him (April 12, 1824), despite the\r\nprotests of a few of its more sagacious members.[5]\r\n\r\nNaturally, this petty act caused an immediate and strong reaction\r\nin a community endeared to Clinton by that splendid creation of his\r\nenergy--the Erie Canal. No sooner did the news reach New York City than\r\n10,000 persons held an indignation meeting in the City Hall Park and\r\nin front of Tammany Hall. Throughout the State similar meetings were\r\nheld. In spite of the politicians, the cyclonic popular movement forced\r\nClinton to be again a candidate for Governor.\r\n\r\nThe chiefs regretted their folly. At the same time they were subjected\r\nto public criticism in another direction. One of them, William P. Van\r\nNess, Burr’s companion at the Hamilton duel, a Judge of the United\r\nStates District Court, took it upon himself to select Tammany Hall\r\npermanently for a court-room, his object being to have the Government\r\npay rent to the Tammany Society. His colleague, Judge Thompson, a\r\nscrupulous official, indignantly asked why the courts were not to be\r\nheld in the City Hall, as usual. Judge Van Ness defiantly held court\r\nin Tammany Hall, Judge Thompson going to the City Hall. Public disgust\r\nasserting itself, an investigation was set afoot. Van Ness tried to\r\nthrow the blame on his marshal. But this officer, as was conclusively\r\nshown, acted under written instructions from Van Ness in refusing to\r\nconsider any other place than Tammany Hall, and he agreed to pay to the\r\nsociety $1,500 a year rent. The lease, which was made under the plea\r\nthat no room was available in the City Hall, contained a stipulation\r\nthat not only should the tavern be allowed in Tammany Hall but that\r\nthe court-room should be used, when required, as the meeting place of\r\nthe society or of the political conventions. The citizens assembled in\r\nthe wards and denounced the proceeding. The Aldermen decided to shift\r\nthe responsibility which Van Ness attempted to place upon them. Their\r\ncommittee reported (October 24, 1824),[6] that the City Hall always had\r\nbeen and would be at the service of the United States Court Judges, and\r\nthat a room had been set apart especially for their use. Judge Van Ness\r\nwas forced to return to the City Hall to hold court.[7]\r\n\r\nTammany now had recourse to its customary devices in endeavoring to\r\nbring out its usual vote in the coming election. The general committee\r\nannounced that at no period in the last twenty years had the welfare\r\nand perpetuity of the party more imperiously required a rigid adherence\r\nto ancient usages and discipline. This was meant to play on the\r\npartizan emotions of the Democrats. It was likewise a threat to punish\r\nany man of independent views who disobeyed the orders of the general\r\ncommittee. Such summary, veiled notifications of the general committee\r\nwere seldom disregarded by those who profited or expected to profit\r\nby politics. After toasting their “squaws and papooses” on July 4 the\r\nsociety impressively made this toast: “May regular nominations ever\r\nprevail”--a thrust at the method of Clinton’s nomination and a warning\r\nfor the future guidance of all Tammany men.\r\n\r\nTammany further attempted to counteract the impetus of the Clinton\r\nmovement by touching at length upon its own patriotism in the past\r\nand by stirring up class hatreds. On the vital issues the Wigwam was\r\nsilent; but in another long fulmination it recalled the “sins” and\r\n“treason” of Clinton against the Democratic party. “He is haughty in\r\nhis manners,” it went on, “and a friend of the aristocracy--cold and\r\ndistant to all who cannot boast of wealth and family distinctions and\r\nselfish in all the ends he aims at.”\r\n\r\nThe partizans of Jackson carried the city. Presidential electors were\r\nstill selected by the Legislature, and it is therefore impossible\r\nto determine Jackson’s vote. A fusion between the Clintonites and\r\nthe People’s party caused the defeat of most of Tammany’s Assembly\r\ncandidates, but the victors were Jackson men, and Clinton himself had\r\ndeclared for Old Hickory. The full Jackson strength was shown in the\r\nvote for the three Tammany candidates for Congress, who were elected.\r\n\r\nClinton’s victory was sweeping. The near completion of the Erie Canal,\r\nfor which he had labored so zealously and which Tammany had opposed\r\nso pertinaciously, made him the idol of the people, and he was again\r\nelected Governor, carrying even New York City by 1,031 majority. That\r\neye was blind which could not see in the opening of the canal the\r\nincalculable benefits Clinton had estimated from the first. This great\r\nwork secured as a virtual gift to New York City the inland commerce of\r\nthe vast empire west of the mountains, no rival being able to contend\r\nfor it. The trade of the canal almost immediately increased the city’s\r\nbusiness $60,000,000 annually, and year by year the amount grew. Along\r\nits course a hundred new and thrifty villages sprang into existence,\r\nand the State’s wealth and population went upward by leaps and bounds.\r\n\r\nCompared with this illustrious achievement, a summary of the record of\r\nClinton’s antagonists, the Tammany leaders, makes but a poor showing.\r\nContributing to the development of democracy, for the most part,\r\nonly so far as it benefited themselves; declining to take up even\r\nthe question of manhood suffrage until forced to, they did little or\r\nnothing, even in the closer domain of the city, for the good of their\r\nown time or of posterity. In the years when Clinton was engaged in\r\nprojecting and building the canal, they were too busy wrangling over\r\noffices or cribbing at the public treasury to improve city conditions.\r\nThe streets were an abomination of filth. The local authorities long\r\nrefused, despite public pressure, to take steps to have the city\r\nfurnished with pure water. As a result of the bad water of a private\r\ncorporation and the uncleanliness of the streets, yellow fever and\r\ncholera had several times devastated the city, and in one year (1822)\r\nit was so deserted that grass grew in the streets. To make up for\r\nmunicipal deficits the city fathers continued selling the public land,\r\nthat might have been made into parks or retained for future uses,\r\nbuying it in as individuals. Between 1813 and 1819, according to the\r\nadmission of the Tammany organ in the latter year, $440,347 worth\r\nof land, whose present value probably amounts to tens of millions\r\nof dollars, was thus fraudulently disposed of.[8] In a word, their\r\nrecords, public and private, furnish an extreme contrast to the record\r\nof Clinton, who, while a politician when need be, gave his years and\r\nhis talents to the completion of a public work of the greatest utility\r\nand importance.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The first election for Mayor by the Common Council, under the new\r\nconstitution, resulted in the choice of William Paulding, Jr., 1823-25.\r\n\r\n[2] Advertisements of the ward committees in the _National Advocate_,\r\nApril 29, 1822.\r\n\r\n[3] It is a convincing commentary on the absolute disruption of party\r\nlines at this epoch that a contest could arise in such an organization\r\nas Tammany Hall between supporters of men of such diverse political\r\nbeliefs as Andrew Jackson and John Quincy Adams.\r\n\r\n[4] When United States Navy Agent in 1820, Robert Swartwout became\r\nindebted to the Government in the sum of $68,000, a defalcation he\r\ncould not make good. The Government took a mortgage on his property\r\nfor $75,000. This and political influence saved him from prison. It\r\nwas because of Adams’s efforts in his behalf that his extraordinary\r\ndevotion to the sixth President was credited. Tammany Hall, considerate\r\nof human infirmity, continued him in full favor as a leader. These\r\nfacts were brought out in the suit of the United States Government\r\nagainst Francis H. Nicholl, one of Robert Swartwout’s sureties, before\r\nJudge Van Ness in the United States District Court, April 8, 1824.\r\n\r\n[5] _Journal of the Senate_, 1824, p. 409.\r\n\r\n[6] _MS. Minutes of the Common Council_, Vol. 52, pp. 75-78.\r\n\r\n[7] During this agitation Jacob Barker, Judge Van Ness and M. M. Noah\r\nrepeatedly presented, in the public prints, arguments in favor of using\r\nTammany Hall as a court-room. We shall have need to refer to Barker\r\nagain on another page.\r\n\r\n[8] For a part of this time, it should be stated, the Federalists were\r\nin power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE JACKSON ELEMENT VICTORIOUS\r\n\r\n1825-1828\r\n\r\n\r\nFactional strife had not entirely smothered the demand for improvement\r\nin the city government.[1] The arbitrary powers of the Common Council,\r\ncomposed, as it was, of one Board in which sat both Aldermen and\r\nAssistant Aldermen, excited general dissatisfaction. Having the power\r\nof making assessments, ordering public improvements, and disposing of\r\nthe public property at will, the Aldermen made no detailed account of\r\ntheir expenditures. One writer advised the Aldermen to curtail some of\r\ntheir own extravagances: “Why not stop,” he wrote,\r\n\r\n    “in their career of eating the most unreasonable and costly\r\n    suppers every time they meet on public business and drinking\r\n    such wines as they never in the course of their lives tasted\r\n    before; choice wines that cost $40 a dozen? O! but I will soon\r\n    tell a tale that will make our citizens stare. I understand\r\n    that our city expenses are now nearly _$2,000 a day_.”\r\n\r\nThe State constitution of 1821-22 had granted the Common Council\r\ngreater powers than before in vacating and filling important offices\r\nin the city. In 1823 the city debt was rising, and though the Common\r\nCouncil professed to attempt retrenchment, no real effort was made, the\r\nfathers being loth to give over the voting of pretended improvements\r\nout of which they benefited as individual contractors. The agitation\r\ncontinuing, the Legislature, in April, 1824, had passed a law to\r\n“erect” two separate chambers--a Board of Aldermen to be elected from\r\namong the freeholders for two years, and a Board of Assistants for one\r\nyear, with concurrent powers. The opponents of the new branch termed it\r\nderisively the “House of Lords” and denounced its aristocratic nature.\r\nThe amendment was defeated by the radicals in June, though the interest\r\nin it was slight. Over 8,000 electors failed to vote.\r\n\r\nOther schemes for municipal reform dissolved in talk, and by the Spring\r\nof 1825 public attention became concentrated again on the matter of\r\nJackson’s candidacy for the office of President. Barely had John\r\nQuincy Adams been inaugurated when Tammany set about to make Jackson\r\nhis successor. On May 12 Sachem Nicholas Schureman, at the anniversary\r\ncelebration of the society, gave this toast: “Jackson, the Hero of New\r\nOrleans, our next President.” Again, on July 4, the principal toast was\r\nto Jackson.[2]\r\n\r\nThe Jackson campaign went energetically on. But it was rudely\r\ninterrupted during the following Autumn by a fresh series of\r\nrevelations regarding certain Tammany chieftains. The legislative\r\nfavoritism by which Jacob Barker was enabled to secure advantages for\r\nhis Exchange Bank (1818)[3] now culminated in a grave public scandal.\r\nIn September, 1826, Barker, Henry Eckford, another of the line of\r\nSachems; Matthew L. Davis, lately Grand Sachem, and several other\r\naccomplices were principals in one of the most extended and sensational\r\ntrials which the city had known. They stood charged with swindles\r\naggregating several million dollars. The Grand Jury’s indictment of\r\nSeptember 15 charged them, and also Mark Spencer, William P. Rathbone,\r\nThomas Vermilyea and others, with defrauding the Mechanics’ Fire\r\nInsurance Company of 1,000 shares of its own capital stock, 1,000\r\nshares of United States Bank stock and $50,000; the Fulton Bank of\r\n2,000 shares of its own capital stock and $50,000; the Tradesmen’s\r\nBank of 2,000 shares of its own capital stock and $50,000; the Morris\r\nCanal and Banking Company of 2,000 shares of its own capital stock\r\nand $50,000; and the Life and Fire Insurance Company of 2,000 shares\r\nof its own capital stock. The indictment further charged these men\r\nwith obtaining fraudulently 1,000 promissory notes for the amount of\r\nnearly $100 each, belonging to the Fulton Bank; and the same number of\r\nnotes for similar sums belonging respectively to the Tradesmen’s Bank,\r\nthe Morris Canal and Banking Company, and the Life and Fire Insurance\r\nCompany, and with additionally obtaining by fraud the sum of $50,000,\r\nthe property of Henry Barclay, George Barclay and others.[4]\r\n\r\nA disagreement of the jury marked the first trial; the second brought a\r\nconviction of the prisoners. Tammany Hall was unwilling to see any of\r\nits leaders go to prison. As soon as the storm of popular indignation\r\nblew over, a new trial was had for Davis, and owing to strong political\r\ninfluence his acquittal was the outcome. Barker was again convicted,\r\nbut, thanks to the discreet use of his money, never saw a cell. He went\r\nSouth and lived on till over ninety years of age.[5] Eckford fled to\r\nthe Orient and died in Syria. The severity of the law fell on the minor\r\noffenders, two of whom, Mowatt and Hyatt, went to prison for two years,\r\nand the Lambert brothers for one year.\r\n\r\nThe trial over, public interest again centered on the Presidential\r\nstruggle. Alive to the necessity of winning Tammany to his interest,\r\nPresident Adams chose most of his New York appointees from its\r\norganization, thereby creating in that body an alert clique of devoted\r\npartizans. If the leaders had been able to direct the organization\r\nabsolutely, Adams might have bribed nearly all of them with offices,\r\nfavors or promises, but there were other deciding factors. The first\r\nwas the mass of the Democrats who favored Jackson and forced most\r\nof the leaders to his support. The second was the organizing genius\r\nof Martin Van Buren. He was a member of the Tammany Society, and in\r\nSeptember, 1827, he visited New York to compose the discord in the\r\ngeneral committee, which was divided equally on the question of the\r\nPresidency, although in the society itself a majority was for Jackson.\r\nThe Jackson men quickly gained predominant influence. On September\r\n27 the general committee recommended in a public address to its\r\n“fellow-citizens” that when they met in their wards, they should elect\r\nsuch citizens _only_, to represent them in their different committees,\r\nas were favorable to Jackson. The Adams men were enraged.[6] Col. James\r\nFairlie, a veteran of the Revolution; Benjamin Romaine, Peter Sharpe,\r\nWilliam Todd, W. H. Ireland, Abraham Stagg, Peter Stagg and John L.\r\nLawrence, known as “the elite” of Tammany Hall, and others, denounced\r\nthis action. “Was such a power of proscription and dictation ever\r\ndelegated to or practised by any other general committee?” they asked\r\nin an address.\r\n\r\nThe ward primary elections on the night of October 3 were tumultuous.\r\nThe Jackson men took possession of the meeting rooms, installed their\r\nown chairmen and passed resolutions, without allowing the Adams\r\nsupporters a chance to be heard. Both factions then alternately\r\nheld meetings in Tammany Hall. So determined was the struggle to get\r\npossession of the Wigwam that the Adams men contrived to expel their\r\nopponents from it for one day, and the Jackson men had to make their\r\nnominations in the cellar called “the Coal Hole.” At a later meeting of\r\nthe Adams faction, embracing a group of old Federalists, Col. Marinus\r\nWillett, a venerable Revolutionary patriot, who presided, spoke of\r\n“the danger and absurdity of confiding the destinies of the country to\r\na mere arbitrary soldier.” The meeting passed resolutions denouncing\r\nthe general committee majority and reiterating its support of Adams.\r\nThe Jackson men rallied to the Wigwam in force and approved the ticket\r\nnominated in “the Coal Hole.” The nominees were for local offices and\r\nwere themselves of no particular importance. The great question was\r\nwhether New York City favored Jackson or Adams, and the coming election\r\nwas the accepted test.\r\n\r\nThe Jackson men made desperate efforts to carry the city. Now were\r\nobservable the effects brought about by the suffrage changes of 1822\r\nand 1826. The formerly disinherited class had become attached to\r\nTammany Hall, and the organization, entirely reversing its exclusive\r\nnative policy, declared for a reduction of the five-year naturalization\r\nperiod. From that time forth the patronage of aliens became a settled\r\npolicy of Tammany. In this election these aliens exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence, materially aiding Jackson.\r\n\r\nCases of fraud and violence had hitherto been frequent; but nothing\r\nlike the exhibition at the primaries and polls in November, 1827, had\r\never been known. Cart-loads of voters, many of whom had been in the\r\ncountry less than three years, were used as repeaters in the different\r\nwards. An instance was known of one cart-load of six men voting at six\r\ndifferent places. Other men boasted of having voted three and four\r\ntimes. In an upper ward, where the foreign population had full sway,\r\nan American found it almost impossible to appear or vote at all. If\r\nhe tried the experiment, he was arrested immediately, his votes were\r\ntaken from him and Jackson votes put in his hands. Many of the polling\r\nplaces had no challengers, and most of the inspectors did duty for\r\nthe Jackson ticket by a display of stout hickory branches. By such\r\nmeans the Jackson men rolled up in the city a majority of nearly five\r\nthousand.\r\n\r\nReflective citizens of both parties were alarmed and humiliated by\r\nthe events of the election. The public conscience was not used to the\r\nindiscriminate stuffing of ballot boxes. To the revelations of this\r\nelection can be traced the origin of the Native American party, whose\r\ncry that “political privileges should belong exclusively to the natives\r\nof the country” even now was heard.\r\n\r\nThough a year before the time for choosing a President, the result of\r\nthis election strongly indicated the choice of Jackson and caused great\r\nexultation and encouragement among his supporters in other cities.\r\nIn the Winter of 1827, Tammany sent a delegation to visit him at New\r\nOrleans, ostensibly to present an address on the anniversary of the\r\nbattle of New Orleans, but in reality, it was supposed, to confer with\r\nhim on the work to be done in his behalf. By the beginning of 1828 the\r\norganization was controlled wholly by Jackson men. Not a nomination,\r\nhowever petty, was made of a man not known to be his partizan. The\r\ngreat body of Democrats approved this course on the ground that\r\nJackson’s election was the real issue, and that local issues were\r\nsubordinate for the time. When the Adams men tried to hold anti-Jackson\r\nmeetings in the Wigwam, the Sachems stepped forward and exercised a\r\nlong dormant power--a power which explains the real connection between\r\nthe society and the organization, and which it frequently used later\r\nagainst hostile factions. Through pressure, the lessee of Tammany\r\nHall sold to the society his lease. This secured, the society put\r\nin charge of the building (which was fitted in part as a hotel as\r\nwell as a hall) another person, instructed not to let any room to the\r\nAdams committee. The Adams men asked by what right a “charitable and\r\nbenevolent society” interfered in politics. But, being excluded, they\r\ncould no longer claim they represented Tammany Hall--a fatal loss to\r\nthem and an important advantage to the Jackson men, who now were the\r\nonly Tammany organization. The Adams committees were thus shut off from\r\nholding any meetings in the hall.\r\n\r\nWith the Adams committees put out, the Jackson men began to quarrel\r\namong themselves for local and State nominations. The Wigwam’s\r\ninveterate foe, De Witt Clinton, was out of the way, he having died on\r\nFebruary 11, 1828, while still Governor. As nominations continued to\r\nbe looked upon as almost certainly resulting in election, there was a\r\nswarm of candidates.[7] The ambitions of few of these were gratified.\r\nThe nominations were settled beforehand by a small clique, headed, it\r\nwas said, by M. M. Noah.\r\n\r\nOf a voting population of 25,000, Tammany Hall secured a majority of\r\n5,831 for Jackson[8] and elected all its candidates except one. That\r\nhundreds, if not thousands, of illegal votes were counted was admitted.\r\nBoys of 19 and 20 years of age voted and were employed to electioneer\r\nfor the Jackson ticket. On the other hand, raftsmen just arrived from\r\nthe interior and men who had no homes were gathered in bunches and sent\r\nto swell the Adams vote, though it is doubtful whether their votes\r\nwere counted. For the first time in city elections money was used to\r\ninfluence voting.\r\n\r\nThe Common Council soon after removed every office-holder not of the\r\nJackson faith. As a matter of course, Jackson rewarded his friends. He\r\nmade Samuel Swartwout Collector of the Port and filled every Federal\r\nlocal post with his Tammany adherents.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] William Paulding was succeeded by Philip Hone (1825-26), who in\r\nturn was followed by Paulding (1826-29).\r\n\r\n[2] This anniversary was the first on which the society, since its\r\nformation, did not march in the streets and go to church. Each\r\n“brother,” wearing a bucktail in front of his hat, went instead to the\r\ngreat council chamber, where the Declaration of Independence was read\r\nby Matthew L. Davis.\r\n\r\n[3] See Chapter vi.\r\n\r\n[4] _Minutes of the Oyer and Terminer_, Vol. 6, pp. 3-137.\r\n\r\n[5] Barker maintained that a conspiracy had been formed against him. A\r\npamphlet entitled, _Jacob Barker’s Letters Developing the Conspiracy\r\nFormed in 1826 for His Ruin_, was extensively circulated about this\r\ntime or later.\r\n\r\n[6] The action of the general committee had a sweeping national\r\nimportance. “The State of New York represents the Democracy of the\r\nUnion; the City of New York gives tone to the State; the General\r\nCommittee govern the City.” Quoted by “A Journalist” as applying to\r\nthese years in his _Memoirs of James Gordon Bennett and His Times_, New\r\nYork, 1855.\r\n\r\n[7] “Should the Independent electors,” wrote one of them, Aaron\r\nSergeant, “give me a nomination (for Sheriff) (as there will be several\r\ncandidates for the office) I shall succeed by a handsome majority. The\r\nSons of Erin are my most particular friends. I rely with confidence on\r\ntheir support.\r\n\r\n“Knowing the office to be one worth $10,000 per annum, should I be\r\nelected, I shall give one-third of the income of this office to be\r\ndivided equally to [among] the several charitable Religious Societies\r\nin the city. My claims for the office are, that I am a citizen born,\r\nand my father one of the _Patriots of the Revolution for seven long\r\nyears …_.”\r\n\r\n[8] This was the first election in the State in which Presidential\r\nelectors were voted on by the people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE WORKINGMEN’S PARTY\r\n\r\n1829-1830\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1829 the indignation against the Tammany leaders crystallized in\r\na “purifying” movement. Under the direction of its banker, merchant\r\nand lawyer leaders, Tammany Hall had been made a medium for either\r\ncoercing or bribing the Legislature or the Common Council into passing\r\ndozens of bank charters and franchises with scarcely any provision\r\nfor compensation to either State or city.[1] In 1819 the Tammany\r\nSociety, in one of its pompous addresses, had recited the speculative\r\nspirit and consequent distress brought about by the multiplication of\r\nincorporated banks, and suggested that the Legislature adopt a prompt\r\nand decisive remedy tending to the abolition of those institutions.\r\nThis sounded well; but at that very time, as before and after, the\r\nSachems were lobbying at Albany for charters of banks of which they\r\nbecame presidents or directors. By one means or another these banks\r\nyielded fortunes to their owners; but the currency issued by them\r\nalmost invariably depreciated. The laboring classes on whom this bad\r\nprivate money was imposed complained of suffering severely. Each year,\r\nbesides, witnessed an increase in the number of chartered monopolies,\r\narmed with formidable powers for long periods, or practically in\r\nperpetuity.[2] To the first gas company, in May, 1823, the Common\r\nCouncil had granted the exclusive right to light all the streets\r\nsouth of Grand street for thirty years, without returns of any kind\r\nto the city.[3] At the rate at which the city was expanding, this\r\nwas a concession of immense value, and formed one of the subjects of\r\ncomplaint in 1829.\r\n\r\nWhile laws were instituted to create a money aristocracy, the old\r\ndebt and other laws bearing on the working classes were not changed.\r\nNo attempt was made to improve a condition which allowed a dishonest\r\ncontractor to put up a building or a series of buildings, collect his\r\nmoney and then swindle his laborers out of their wages. The local\r\nadministration, moreover, continued corrupt. It was freely charged\r\nat this time that $250,000 of city money was being stolen outright\r\nevery year. The city charter drafted and adopted in 1829-30 contained\r\nprovisions which, it was thought, might remedy matters. It created two\r\nbodies of the Common Council--the Aldermen and Assistant Aldermen--and\r\ngave each a negative upon the propositions of the other, vesting a\r\nsupreme veto power in the Mayor. It again separated the election of the\r\nCommon Council from the general election. It abolished secret contracts\r\nand compelled all resolutions involving appropriations of public money\r\nor placing taxes or assessments to be advertised, and included other\r\nprecautionary measures against corruption. But it opposed the public\r\nwish in still vesting the appointment of the Mayor in the Common\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nTo battle against the prevailing injustices the Mechanics’ or\r\nWorkingmen’s party was formed. Its chief inspiration was Robert\r\nDale Owen, son of the famous Robert Owen. “Dale” Owen, as he was\r\nfamiliarly known, and others had recently returned to the city after\r\nan unsuccessful experiment at cooperative colonizing at New Harmony,\r\nIndiana, and a number of bright and ardent intellects gathered about\r\nhim. Boldly declaring against the private and exclusive possession of\r\nthe soil and against the hereditary transmission of property, the new\r\nparty won over a large part of the laboring element. “Resolved,” ran\r\nits resolutions adopted at Military Hall, October 19, 1829,\r\n\r\n    “in the opinion of this meeting, that the first appropriation\r\n    of the soil of the State to private and exclusive possession\r\n    was eminently and barbarously unjust. That it was substantially\r\n    feudal in its character, inasmuch as those who received\r\n    enormous and unequal possessions were _lords_ and those who\r\n    received little or nothing were _vassals_. That hereditary\r\n    transmission of wealth on the one hand and poverty on the\r\n    other, has brought down to the present generation all the evils\r\n    of the feudal system, and that, in our opinion, is the prime\r\n    source of all our calamities.”\r\n\r\nAfter declaring that the Workingmen’s party would oppose all exclusive\r\nprivileges, monopolies and exemptions, the resolutions proceeded:\r\n\r\n    “We consider it an exclusive privilege for one portion of the\r\n    community to have the _means of education in colleges_ while\r\n    another is restricted to common schools, or perhaps, by extreme\r\n    poverty, even deprived of the limited education to be acquired\r\n    in those establishments. Our voice, therefore, shall be raised\r\n    in favor of a system of education which shall be equally open\r\n    to _all_, as in a real republic it should be.”\r\n\r\nThe banks, too, came in for a share of the denunciation. The bankers\r\nwere styled “the greatest knaves, impostors and paupers of the age.”\r\nThe resolutions continued:\r\n\r\n    “As banking is now conducted, the owners of the banks receive\r\n    annually of the people of this State not less than two millions\r\n    of dollars in their paper money (and it might as well be pewter\r\n    money) for which there is and can be nothing provided for its\r\n    redemption on demand.…”\r\n\r\nThe Workingmen put a full ticket in the field.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall, dominated by some of the same men and interests denounced\r\nby the Workingmen’s party, opened a campaign of abuse. Commercial and\r\nbanking men outside the Wigwam joined ardently in the campaign. The new\r\nmovement was declared to be a mushroom party, led by designing men,\r\nwhose motives were destructive. The _Evening Post_, which represented\r\nthe commercial element and which sided with Tammany in opposition to\r\nthe new party, said that it remained for the really worthy mechanics\r\nwho might have associated accidentally with that party, to separate\r\nthemselves from it, now that its designs and doctrines were known. The\r\n_Courier and Enquirer_, partly owned and edited by Noah,[4] styled\r\nthe Workingmen’s party an infidel ticket, hostile to the morals, to\r\nthe institutions of society and the rights of property. The Tammany\r\nHall, or to speak more technically, the Democratic-Republican General\r\nCommittee, declaiming on the virtues of Jackson and Democracy, advised\r\nall good men, and especially all self-respecting laborers, not to vote\r\nthe Workingmen’s ticket.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, its principles made such an impression that in\r\nNovember it polled over 6,000 votes, while Tammany, with its compact\r\norganization, could claim little more than 11,000 votes. It was\r\nwell settled that numbers of Whig workingmen voted the new party’s\r\nticket; and that the rich Whigs secretly worked for the success of\r\nTammany Hall, whose ticket was almost entirely successful, though the\r\nWorkingmen elected Ebenezer Ford to the Assembly.\r\n\r\nTammany was dismayed at the new party’s strength, and determined to\r\ndestroy it by championing one of the reform measures demanded. In\r\nJanuary, 1830, a bill for the better security of mechanics and other\r\nlaborers of New York City was introduced by Silas M. Stillwell. The\r\nTammany men immediately took it up as if it were their own, urged\r\nits passage and secured the credit of its adoption, when in April,\r\nmuch emasculated, it became a law. It required, under penalties, the\r\nowner of a building to retain from the contractor the amount due to\r\nthe mechanics employed thereon. By exploiting this performance to the\r\nutmost, Tammany succeeded in making some inroads on the Workingmen’s\r\nparty. The organization leaders had recognized that it was time they\r\ndid something for the laboring classes. They were fast losing caste\r\nwith even independent Democrats of means, because of their subservience\r\nto the aristocracy and of the common knowledge of the illegitimate ways\r\nin which they were amassing wealth.\r\n\r\nOne result of the Workingmen’s movement was the failure of the Wigwam\r\nto secure a majority in the Common Council. This seemed to frustrate\r\nthe design to reelect, as Mayor, Walter Bowne (Grand Sachem in 1820\r\nand 1831). Fourteen Aldermen and Assistants were opposed to Bowne, and\r\nthirteen favored him. There was but one expedient calculated to reelect\r\nhim, and to this Tammany Hall resorted. Bowne, as presiding officer\r\nof the Council, held that the constitution permitted him to vote for\r\nthe office of Mayor. “I will persist in this opinion even though the\r\nboard decide against me,” he said. To prevent a vote being taken, seven\r\nof Bowne’s opponents withdrew on December 28, 1829. They went back on\r\nJanuary 6, 1830, when Tammany managed to reelect Bowne by one vote. How\r\nthis vote was obtained was a mystery. Fourteen members declared under\r\noath that they had voted for Thomas R. Smith, Bowne’s opponent.[5]\r\nCharges of bribery were made, and an investigating committee was\r\nappointed on January 11; but as this committee was composed of Bowne’s\r\nown partizans, it announced its inability to find proofs. Meanwhile the\r\ngeneral committee[6] had issued a loftily worded manifesto saying that\r\nit (the committee) was established and was maintained to watch over the\r\npolitical interests of the Democratic-Republicans of the city and “to\r\nexpose and repel the insidious and open machinations of their enemies,”\r\nthat it could not discover anything wrong in the conduct of the Chief\r\nMagistrate of the city, and that it “repelled the accusations of his\r\nenemies.”\r\n\r\nThe Workingmen’s party continued its agitation, and prepared for\r\nanother campaign. In the meantime the Wigwam’s agents skilfully went\r\nabout fomenting divisions, with the result that three tickets, all\r\npurporting to be the genuine Workingmen’s, were put into the field\r\nin October, 1830. One was that of the “Clay Workingmen”; it was\r\ncomposed of a medley of admirers of Clay, the owners of stock in\r\nvarious great manufacturing establishments, workingmen who believed\r\nin a protective tariff, Whigs,[7] and a bunch of hack politicians who\r\nhad taken up the Workingmen’s movement for selfish ends. The second\r\nwas that of a fragment of the Workingmen’s party of the year before,\r\nstanding resolutely for their principles and containing no suspicious\r\npoliticians or monopolists. The third was that of the Agrarian party,\r\nembracing a few individuals of views too advanced even for the\r\nWorkingmen’s party.\r\n\r\nTo the Clay Workingmen’s party[8] Tammany Hall gave little attention,\r\nsince it was made up mainly of Whigs who had always, under different\r\nnames, been opposed to the organization. But the genuine movement\r\nTammany Hall covered with abuse. “Look, fellow-citizens,” said the\r\naddress of the “general nominating committee,”\r\n\r\n    “upon the political horizon and mark the fatal signs\r\n    prognosticating evils of a dire and fatal nature! Associations\r\n    and political sects of a new and dangerous character have\r\n    lately stalked into existence, menacing the welfare and\r\n    good order of society. These associations … have assumed to\r\n    represent two of the most useful and respectable classes of our\r\n    citizens--our _Workingmen and Mechanics …_. Confide in them,\r\n    and when they have gained their ends they will treat you with\r\n    derision and scorn! Then rally round your ancient and trusty\r\n    friends and remember that honest men and good citizens never\r\n    assume false names nor fight under borrowed banners!”\r\n\r\nTo display its devotion to the cause of Democracy, Tammany Hall\r\ncelebrated, on November 26, the revolution in France. It persuaded\r\nformer President James Monroe to preside in Tammany Hall at the\r\npreliminary arrangements, and made a studied parade of its zeal. There\r\nwas a procession, Samuel Swartwout acting as grand marshal. Monroe, in\r\na feeble state of health, was brought in a stage to Washington Square,\r\nwhere for ten minutes he looked on. A banquet, the usual high-flown\r\nspeeches, and fireworks followed.\r\n\r\nThe election was favorable to Tammany. About 3,800 workingmen who\r\nhad supported the independent movement the previous year, went back\r\nto Tammany, because of its advocacy of the mechanics’ lien law. The\r\naverage Tammany plurality was 3,000. The real Workingmen’s ticket\r\npolled a vote of about 2,200; the Clay Workingmen’s ticket a little\r\nabove 7,000, and the Agrarian, 116.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years the contest of Jackson with the United States\r\nBank drew together the energies of all Democrats supporting him.\r\nDropping local contests, they united to renew his power. For the time,\r\nthe Workingmen’s movement ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] “The members [of the Legislature] themselves sometimes participated\r\nin the benefits growing out of charters created by their own votes; …\r\nif ten banks were chartered at one session, twenty must be chartered\r\nthe next and thirty the next. The cormorants could never be gorged.\r\nIf at one session you bought off a pack of greedy lobby agents … they\r\nreturned with increased numbers and more voracious appetite.”--Hammond,\r\nVol. II, pp. 447-48.\r\n\r\nFour conspicuous “charter dealers” at Albany were Sachems Samuel B.\r\nRomaine, Michael Ulshoeffer, Peter Sharpe and Abraham Stagg, all\r\npowerful organization leaders.\r\n\r\n[2] Hammond, Vol. II, pp. 447-48.\r\n\r\n[3] _MS. Minutes of the Common Council_, Vol. 48, pp. 59-60.\r\n\r\n[4] Noah, after falling into financial difficulties, had been ousted\r\nfrom the editorship of the _National Advocate_ and had now become\r\nassociated with his former political enemy, James Watson Webb, in the\r\nconduct of the _Courier and Enquirer_.\r\n\r\n[5] _MS. Minutes of the Common Council_, Vol. 70, p. 311. Shortly after\r\nthis the Wigwam men removed Smith from his post of Commissioner of\r\nthe Almshouse for opposing Bowne. So great was the haste to oust him,\r\nbefore the Aldermen went out of office, that one of the board seconded\r\nthe motion for his removal before the motion was made.\r\n\r\n[6] The general committee was now composed of thirty-six members,\r\nmainly the directors in banking and other companies. Remonstrances at\r\nthis time were frequent that its important proceedings were a sealed\r\nbook to the electors. Among other things it dictated to the wards not\r\nonly when, but where, they should meet.\r\n\r\n[7] The term “Whig” had now come to have a definite party meaning,\r\nbeing used as a popular designation of the group led by John Quincy\r\nAdams and Henry Clay, officially known (1828-36) as the National\r\nRepublican party. The term is first found in American politics applied\r\nto the Separatists during the Revolution. About 1808 it was taken by\r\nthe anti-Burr faction of the Democratic-Republican party.\r\n\r\n[8] The men of this party, as a rule, voted the Anti-Masonic State\r\nticket. While the Anti-Masonic party occasioned political commotion in\r\nthe State, there is no evidence that it had any perceptible effect on\r\nTammany’s career.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTAMMANY AND THE BANK CONTEST\r\n\r\n1831-1834\r\n\r\n\r\nTammany lost no time in announcing its intention to support the\r\nrenomination of Jackson. The general committee, on March 3, 1831,\r\nunanimously passed a resolution approving of his renomination by the\r\nDemocratic members of the Legislature. Seven days later the General\r\nCommittee of Democratic Young Men and the ward committees acted\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\nSince the campaign of 1800 there had not been a Presidential contest\r\nin which the masses joined with such enthusiasm. Although the national\r\nelection was more than 18 months distant, the excitement was intense.\r\nThe late Workingmen’s party and Tammany men fraternized. The ward\r\nresolutions were full of fire, the meetings spirited. The Democratic\r\nelectors of the Sixth Ward “friendly to regular nominations” resolved,\r\non March 15:\r\n\r\n    “… That aristocracy in all its forms is odious to us as\r\n    Democratic-Republicans, and that of all aristocracies an\r\n    aristocracy of wealth, grinding the faces of the poor and\r\n    devouring the substance of the people, is the most alarming.\r\n    That we regard an incorporated association of rich men wielding\r\n    the whole monied capital of the country as dangerous to our\r\n    rights and liberties. That we consider the next Presidential\r\n    election as substantially a contest between the people on one\r\n    side and the monied aristocracy of the country on the other.”[1]\r\n\r\nThe organization’s first object was to gain a majority of the local\r\noffices in the Spring election of 1831 on the Jackson issue. The\r\nNational Republican party, recently organized in New York City on the\r\nsame general lines as Tammany Hall, and headed by Clarkson Crolius,\r\na former Grand Sachem, set out to crush the Jackson movement. If a\r\ndefeat could be administered to it at this time, the practical effect\r\nwould be great; New York would possibly influence the entire Union. To\r\naccomplish this, the National Republicans tried to divert the issue to\r\nlocal lines and agitated for the election of the Mayor by the people.\r\nThe Tammany men joined issue at once, and in February, 1831, the Common\r\nCouncil committee on application, composed chiefly of Tammany men,\r\nreported adversely on a motion to suggest to the Legislature a revision\r\nof the charter. The time was declared to be inexpedient for such an\r\ninnovation, one Tammany Alderman, Thomas T. Woodruff, declaring,\r\nwhen the matter again came up, on April 8, that the people could not\r\nbe trusted with the choice of that important official. The National\r\nRepublicans replied by denouncing the Common Council for its lavish\r\nexpenditures of public money, its distribution of favors in the shape\r\nof “jobs” and contracts among a few retainers whose sole merits lay in\r\ntheir close relationship to certain managing members of the board, and\r\nfor its efforts to prevent the people from having the right to elect\r\ntheir own Mayor.[2]\r\n\r\nThe opposition to Tammany was ineffectual. In the ensuing election,\r\nnot less than 22 of the 28 members chosen for the new double-chamber\r\nCommon Council were Tammany men, elected solely upon their pledge of\r\nallegiance to the national and State administrations. The first trial\r\nof the new charter, therefore, showed that the separation of municipal\r\nfrom general elections did not prevent the division of the voters on\r\nnational party lines. The extent of this preliminary Jackson victory\r\nmade a sensation throughout the Union and caused gloom among the United\r\nStates Bank supporters.\r\n\r\nThe prestige of Tammany Hall was now overwhelming; its influence\r\nupon the Democratic party, great before, became greater. No aspirant\r\nfor public favor could ignore its demands and decrees. When, on May\r\n12, the society held an imposing celebration of the forty-second\r\nanniversary of its founding, politicians from the highest to the\r\nlowest, national and local, four hundred and over, crowded there with\r\nwords of flattery. Lewis Cass, Nathaniel P. Tallmadge, the Governor and\r\nLieutenant-Governor of the State of New York; members of the National\r\nSenate and of the House of Representatives--these and the rest were\r\nglad to avail themselves of the invitation. William Mooney was there,\r\nvery old and feeble, beaming with pride at the power of the institution\r\nhe had founded.[3] After the banquet, which was described in the old\r\nIndian terms, as consisting “of the game of the forest, the fish of the\r\nlakes, the fruits of the season and the waters of the great spring,”\r\ncame the reading of letters. Jackson wrote: “Nothing could afford\r\nme greater gratification than to participate with your ancient and\r\nhonorable society of Republicans on such an occasion,” but that press\r\nof official duties kept him away. A letter of regret, in high-flown and\r\nlaudatory diction, from Secretary of State Martin Van Buren followed.\r\nJames Watson Webb proposed this toast: “Martin Van Buren, the Grand\r\nSachem of the Eagle Tribe--The Great Spirit is pleased with his\r\nfaithful support of the Great Grand Sachem of the Nation and smiles\r\ngraciously upon the sages and warriors of the tribe who aim to elevate\r\ntheir chief in 1836 to the highest station in the country.” This was\r\ngreeted by nine cheers, and instantly disclosed Tammany’s choice for\r\nJackson’s successor in 1836. The only troublous note was furnished by\r\nDuff Green, who sprang this toast upon the surprised gathering: “De\r\nWitt Clinton--His friends honor his memory--his enemies dare not assail\r\nit!” By “enemies” he referred to those present; they retorted that he\r\nwas an intruder, was not invited, and had not paid for his ticket.[4]\r\nMayor Bowne was then installed as Grand Sachem in place of Stephen\r\nAllen, the former Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe Fall election of 1831 also turned upon national issues. Upon\r\nJackson’s popularity nearly every Democratic candidate in New York\r\ncity was elected by an average majority of 6,000. There were rumors of\r\nillegal voting, but no proof was submitted. The Wigwam was so overjoyed\r\nat the result that a banquet was held on November 21, presided over by\r\nBenjamin Bailey, who for a dozen years had been chairman of the general\r\ncommittee. He had reached his seventy-second year and could claim\r\nlittle political influence. But as a captain in the Revolutionary army,\r\nand as one of those confined in the Jersey prison ships, the Tammany\r\nchiefs considered him a valuable figurehead. Gen. Wool, Cols. Twiggs\r\nand Crogham and five hundred men of various importance spent the night\r\nin the Wigwam drinking to Jackson, Tammany Hall and coming victory.\r\n\r\nNot only did Tammany take the initiative in supporting Jackson, but it\r\nwas the first body to nominate Van Buren for Vice-President. On the\r\nnews of the Senate’s rejection of Van Buren as Minister to England, an\r\nindignation meeting was held in Tammany Hall, January 30, 1832, this\r\nbeing the opening expression of public opinion. Van Buren was suggested\r\nfor Vice-President, and the Wigwam gathering showed its satisfaction by\r\nrepeated cheers.[5] Twenty-four leading Tammany men drew up a letter\r\ncontaining their sentiments on Van Buren’s rejection, and on May 31 an\r\noutpouring in the Wigwam approved his nomination.\r\n\r\nThen followed a striking revelation, showing the venality of some of\r\nTammany’s leaders. The United States Bank officials began bargaining\r\nfor the betrayal of Jackson. The _Courier and Enquirer_ suddenly\r\nabandoned him for the support of the bank candidates, giving as a\r\nreason the fear of the “fearful consequences of revolution, anarchy\r\nand despotism,” which assuredly would ensue if Jackson were reelected.\r\nThe real reason was that Webb and Noah, as revealed by a Congressional\r\ninvestigation,[6] had borrowed directly and indirectly $50,000 from the\r\nUnited States Bank, which had now called them to time. Mayor Bowne was\r\ntheir sponsor to Nicholas Biddle, head of the bank. Some of the other\r\nTammany leaders, it appeared, had been for years the bank’s retainers.\r\nRepresentative Churchill C. Cambreleng enjoyed a place on its pay\r\nrolls. Gulian C. Verplanck, another of the Wigwam’s representatives\r\nin Congress, had voted in its behalf, and Stephen Allen, in the State\r\nSenate, had voted for a resolution in its favor. Peter Sharpe, Ogden\r\nEdwards,[7] William H. Ireland, John Morss--all influential men in\r\ntimes past--now vigorously opposed Jackson, and the services of other\r\nTammany chiefs were secured.\r\n\r\nTwo influences, however, prevented the organization leaders from\r\nbetraying the Democratic cause--one the common people, the other the\r\nowners of the State banks, whose self-interest called for the speedy\r\ndownfall of the United States Bank. Finding that they could not control\r\nthe Wigwam, the Tammany agents of that bank seceded, and joined the\r\nNational Republicans. The State Bank men remained in the organization\r\nand labored for Jackson, with no other idea than that their\r\ninstitutions would benefit in the distribution of Government funds\r\nif the United States Bank were put down. The course of the leaders\r\nremaining in Tammany smacked of double dealing. Refusing to renominate\r\nVerplanck, they put in his place Dudley Selden, who had borrowed $8,000\r\nfrom the United States Bank, but who had professed to support Jackson’s\r\nveto. It looked as though certain potent influences were operating in\r\nTammany Hall for the election of a pro-bank Congress, whoever might be\r\nchosen President.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany ward organizations, assisted by the men of the late\r\nWorkingmen’s party, appointed vigilance committees to undo any mischief\r\nthe leaders might attempt, and to electioneer for Jackson’s success.\r\nSo enthusiastic was the Jackson feeling that many politicians of note,\r\nunderstanding its depth and having a care for their political futures,\r\nmade haste to change front. Almost daily the people were rallied to the\r\nWigwam by the beating of drums. A few years before, a hickory tree had\r\nbeen planted in front of the Wigwam; now, on October 30, a second was\r\nput there, and a barrel of beer was used to moisten its roots.\r\n\r\nBoth sides were guilty of election frauds. Votes were bought at\r\nthe rate of $5 each, most of the buying being done by the National\r\nRepublicans, who were supplied with abundant resources. The National\r\nRepublicans, moreover, had sought to bribe certain men with the promise\r\nof offices, and on the three election days they foisted upon the voters\r\na Jackson electoral ticket containing forty-three names, instead of the\r\nlegal number, forty-two, thereby invalidating each of these ballots\r\nvoted. This trick, it was calculated, lost to Jackson more than a\r\nthousand votes. Of a total of 30,474 votes, Tammany carried the city by\r\n5,620 majority. The Wigwam for many successive nights was filled with\r\ncelebrating crowds. Jackson gave a conspicuously public display of his\r\nrecognition of Tammany’s invaluable services, when, on the evening of\r\nJune 13, 1833, he visited the society, attended by the Vice-President,\r\nSecretary Woodbury, Gov. William L. Marcy, the Mayor, and the members\r\nof the Common Council.\r\n\r\nThe United States Bank supporters did not surrender with Jackson’s\r\nreelection. They exerted themselves to influence Congress by means of a\r\ndefeat for the anti-bank forces in New York City in the Fall election\r\nof 1833. Tammany Hall during the campaign sent out runners ordering\r\nevery office-holder to his electioneering post. Vigorous meetings were\r\nheld, and all the secret influences of the general committee were\r\nemployed. On the other hand, merchants laid aside their ruffled shirts\r\nand broadcloth coats, put on their roundabouts and worked at the polls\r\non the three election days for the Whig ticket. Tammany carried the\r\ncity by between 2,000 and 3,000 majority. Touching this and previous\r\nelections a committee of Assistant Aldermen reported on February 10,\r\n1834: “That frauds have been practised at the polls, the committee\r\nare convinced. At any rate, a universal and deep conviction prevails\r\namong our citizens that tricks have been resorted to for the purpose of\r\ndefeating the election of one candidate and securing that of another.”\r\nIt was further set forth that persons were brought up to vote who\r\nwere not citizens of the United States nor qualified to vote in the\r\nState. Others voted in more than one ward. Voters also were transferred\r\novernight from a sure to a doubtful ward.[8] No remedy followed the\r\nreport.\r\n\r\nThe Spring election of 1834, though local, again turned upon national\r\nissues. For the first time in the history of the city, the Mayor was to\r\nbe elected by the people. The growth of public opinion had been such\r\nthat the Legislature was forced, in 1833, to grant this reform.\r\n\r\nThe contending hosts were swayed, first, by the question of the United\r\nStates Bank, and second, by the spoils. The merchants shut their shops\r\nand sent their whole body of clerks and laboring men to surround the\r\npolls and influence voters against Tammany Hall. The United States Bank\r\nspread abroad the cry of “panic.” If its directors could show that\r\npublic opinion in the foremost city in the Union had altered so as to\r\nfavor the continuation of the bank charter, then they could use that\r\nas a good basis for influencing Congress. There was no concealment of\r\ncoercion of voters; the weak, the timid, the fearful were overawed by\r\nthe increasing clamor of paid newspapers that the destruction of the\r\nUnited States Bank meant “widespread revulsion of trade and everlasting\r\ninjury to the poor.” In fact, a general depression of business was\r\nproduced. A row began in the “bloody ould Sixth,” by the breaking\r\nof some ballot boxes. Both parties armed with stones and bludgeons,\r\nand turned the scene into one of violence. The riot became general.\r\nA crowd, composed chiefly of Whigs, ransacked gun-shops in Broadway\r\nand made for the State arsenal at Elm and Franklin streets. Rumors of\r\ntheir intentions spreading, a gathering of peaceably inclined citizens\r\narrived before them and held the arsenal until the militia hastened\r\nthere and restored order.[9]\r\n\r\nCornelius W. Lawrence, the Tammany candidate, was declared elected by\r\n181 votes out of a total of nearly 35,000[10] over Gulian G. Verplanck,\r\nwho had gone over to the Whigs. Verplanck never ceased to contend that\r\nhe had been defrauded of the office. The Whigs obtained a majority\r\nin a Common Council, 17 members to the Wigwam’s 15, and joyfully said\r\nthat Tammany Hall in electing the Mayor had the shadow; while they, in\r\nsecuring the corporation, had the substance. With the Common Council\r\nthey could carry the whole patronage of the city, amounting to more\r\nthan $1,000,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThis election demonstrated clearly that the propertied classes as\r\na whole were combined against the laborers, mechanics, farmers and\r\nproducing classes generally, and that they were as much concerned over\r\nthe spoils of office as was the most rabid Tammany man. As a protest\r\nagainst the indifference of the local leaders of both parties to the\r\nreal interests of the people, and to put a stop to the granting of\r\nspecial privileges, the Equal Rights party now came into existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Advertisement in the New York _Evening Post_, March 17, 1831.\r\n\r\n[2] Resolutions of the Sixth Ward Anti-Tammany Republicans, March 24,\r\n1831.\r\n\r\n[3] Mooney passed away the following November.

Further charges credited him with\r\nhaving cleaned up more than $50,000 in five years, through various\r\npickings connected with his office. Such, however, was his influence,\r\nthat he not only escaped prosecution, but retained an unimpaired\r\nprestige in the organization.\r\n\r\n[8] _Documents of the Board of Aldermen and Assistant Aldermen_, 1834,\r\nNo. 82.\r\n\r\n[9] _Documents of the Board of Aldermen_, 1839, No. 29.\r\n\r\n[10] Lawrence, 17,576; Verplanck, 17,395; blank and scattering, 18;\r\ntotal, 34,989.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE EQUAL RIGHTS PARTY\r\n\r\n1834-1837\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights movement, which began its activity inside the Tammany\r\norganization, was virtually a moral, then a political, revival of the\r\nWorkingmen’s movement. Its principles, however, were less radical,\r\nand its demands more moderate. It advocated the equal rights of\r\nevery citizen in his person and property and in their management;\r\ndeclared unqualified and uncompromising opposition to bank notes as\r\na circulating medium, because gold and silver were the only safe and\r\nconstitutional currency, and a like opposition to all monopolies\r\nby legislation. It also announced hostility “to the dangerous and\r\nunconstitutional creation of vested rights by legislation, because\r\nthese were a usurpation of the people’s sovereign rights,” and asserted\r\nthat all laws or acts of incorporation passed by the Legislature could\r\nbe rightfully altered or repealed by its successors. The Equal Rights\r\nmovement comprised men of various classes. Moses Jacques and Levi D.\r\nSlamm were its principal leaders. To comprehend its nature, a brief\r\nreview of the causes which conspired to bring it into being will be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nUp to 1831 the repeal of the law for the imprisonment of debtors\r\nhad been a subject of almost constant agitation by reformers and\r\nworkingmen. Under this law more than 10,000 persons, mainly unfortunate\r\nlaborers, were imprisoned annually in loathsome prisons, without\r\ninquiry as to their innocence or guilt, lying there at their\r\ncreditors’ will, unsupplied by the city with any of the necessities\r\nof life.[1] Tammany Hall had taken no action until 1831, when its\r\nleaders gave a belated approval to a bill introduced in the Assembly,\r\nabolishing imprisonment for debts of any sum except in the cases of\r\nnon-residents.[2]\r\n\r\nThis bill had become a law in that year; yet by 1833 the interest of\r\nTammany’s chiefs in the workingman had died away to such an extent that\r\nthe Assembly was allowed to pass a measure entitled “a law abolishing\r\nimprisonment for debt,” but reinstituting imprisonment on all debts\r\nunder $50, thus completely nullifying the law so far as the poor were\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nThe measure failed to become a law; but the sharp practise shown in\r\nits wording, and in the means taken to push it through the Assembly,\r\ndisgusted the Equal Rights men, and in their meetings they passed\r\nresolutions denouncing the chiefs responsible therefor. Their\r\nresolutions furthermore declared that the proceedings at Tammany\r\nHall were a sealed book; that a few men--William Paxen Hallett,\r\nElisha Tibbits, J. J. Roosevelt and John Y. Cebra--made up important\r\nnominations in Wall street after the bankers had decided upon the\r\ncandidates and then had the nominating committee accept them.\r\n\r\nPopular disaffection was increased by the manner in which the\r\nLegislature and the Aldermen continued to create corporations with\r\nenormous grants. The scandals over the procurement of legislative\r\ncharters, particularly bank charters, had for more than 25 years\r\naroused a growing indignation among the people. In 1805, shortly\r\nafter the passage of the Merchants’ Bank charter, Peter Betts, an\r\nAssemblyman, declared in open session of the lower house, that Luke\r\nMetcalfe, a fellow-member, had sought to bribe him to vote for the\r\nmeasure. The price promised was 15 shares of the bank’s stock, valued\r\nat $50 each. Conflicting testimony was given on the matter, and a\r\nmotion was made to expel Metcalfe; the house, however, retained him in\r\nhis seat by a vote of 37 to 16.[3]\r\n\r\nCharges of the same kind, affecting practically every session of the\r\nLegislature, were common, though only occasionally were they made the\r\nsubject of official investigation. In 1812, however, shortly after\r\nthe Assembly, forced by public criticism, had passed a resolution\r\ncompelling each member to pledge himself that he had neither taken\r\nnor would take, “any reward or profit, direct or indirect, for any\r\nvote on any measure,”[4] another scandal arose. The Bank of America,\r\nwith very moderate assets of any sort, received a charter on a stated\r\ncapitalization of $6,000,000, an enormous sum in those days. Charges of\r\ncorruption were bandied about, one Assemblyman, Silas Holmes, declaring\r\nunder oath that the sum of $500, “besides a handsome present,” had been\r\noffered him. A committee of the lower house listened to testimony in\r\nthe case, and then, by a decisive majority, voted that the body was\r\nabove suspicion.[5] But in a pronunciamento to Gov. Tompkins during the\r\nsame year the same house graciously reported: “We are well aware that\r\nthe number of charters for banking institutions already granted has\r\nawakened general solicitude and anxiety.”\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Bank was a more modern instance. The report of the joint\r\nlegislative committee in 1824 had shown that its promoters set apart\r\n$50,000 worth of stock at par value[6] to buy the votes of members,\r\nGen. Robert Swartwout--he who had defaulted for $68,000 in 1820--acting\r\nas one of the lobbyists and claiming $5,000 for his services.[7] Other\r\nscandals throwing strong light on legislative practises were those of\r\nthe Ætna and Chatham Fire Insurance Companies. The testimony brought\r\nout in the investigation of these companies in 1826 showed that\r\nWilliam J. Waldron (one of the line of Grand Sachems) gave $20,000\r\nin certificates of stock to Gen. Jasper Ward, a State Senator, and\r\n$20,000 more to various other persons to get the Ætna charter through\r\nthe Legislature.[8] The Chatham charter, passed in 1822, cost $20,000\r\nin stock at par value, additional sums being paid for the passage of\r\ncertain amendments in 1824.[9] Ward wrote from Albany to a friend in\r\nthe city, complaining that the Jefferson Fire Insurance Company, which\r\nsecured a charter at the same time (1824), had paid only 5 per cent. of\r\nwhat it had promised, giving notes for the remainder.[10] These were\r\nbut a few examples of the general legislative corruption. The men who\r\nprofited by these charters brought about, in 1830, the exemption of\r\nbank stock in the city from taxation. That nearly every Tammany leader\r\nheld bank stock was proved by the testimony before an investigating\r\ncommittee in June, 1833, which set forth how the organizers of the\r\nnewly founded Seventh Ward Bank had distributed thousands of shares\r\namong over one hundred State and city office-holders, both Tammany\r\nand Anti-Masonic. Every Tammany Senator was involved. James Perkins,\r\nthe principal lobbyist for the charter, swore repeatedly that $5,000\r\nin stock at par value had been taken directly by State Senators and\r\nfrom $10,000 to $25,000 in stock distributed indirectly.[11] Perkins\r\ncharged Thurlow Weed with accepting a $500 bribe.[12] The investigating\r\ncommittee reported finally that it could find no proof involving any\r\nbut one of the accused.[13] As the bill for the charter had originally\r\npassed the Senate by a vote of 27 to 2,[14] and as the members of\r\nthe investigating committee had been chosen from this majority, its\r\nconclusions were naturally viewed with a good deal of suspicion.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights men complained that 75 per cent. of the whole of the\r\nbank notes circulating in New York City consisted of depreciated paper.\r\nThe circulation of these in notes of $5 or under amounted by March,\r\n1835, to nearly $1,500,000. One establishment alone, whose weekly\r\npayroll in 1834 amounted to $40,000, paid the greater part of this sum\r\nin depreciated notes. The wage-earner was in constant fear that any\r\nmorning he might wake to hear that the bank whose notes he held had\r\nfailed. Frequently the worst deceptions on the public were connived at\r\nby the officials. The Hudson Insurance Company, for instance, with a\r\nnominal capital of $200,000, was permitted to issue bonds to the amount\r\nof $800,000, upon the most fictitious resources. This was far from\r\nbeing an isolated instance. The law allowed a bank with only $100,000\r\ncapital to loan $250,000, thus receiving interest on more than twice\r\nthe capital actually invested.[15]\r\n\r\nThe Council was more than ever a hotbed of venality. Numberless\r\nsmall “jobs” were perpetrated without public notice; but when it was\r\nproposed in October, 1831, to give the Harlem Railroad Company the\r\nfranchise for the perpetual and exclusive use of Fourth avenue, free\r\nof all payment to the city, Alderman George Sharp, one of the few\r\npublic-spirited members, drew general attention to the matter by an\r\nenergetic denunciation. After every other means had been resorted to\r\nwithout success to influence his vote, he was told that he would be\r\nexcluded from the party by certain persons at Tammany Hall. Alderman\r\nStevens, who declared that he had seen stock given to members of the\r\nboard and to the “corps editorial” to secure their influence, was also\r\nthreatened. The words of these two men proved conclusively the truth\r\nof what for a long time was common report: that the group of Tammany\r\nleaders not only controlled the party nominations but threatened public\r\nofficials with their displeasure, with all which that implied--exile\r\nfrom public life, loss of political influence, perhaps ruin of\r\nfortune--in case they did not vote for certain measures whose “merits”\r\nwere recommended to them.\r\n\r\nThe laborer had other grievances. For seventeen years the Council had\r\nrefused to grant any additional ferries between New York City and\r\nBrooklyn. During that period the population of New York had increased\r\n150,000 and that of Brooklyn 15,000. This growth involved a vast amount\r\nof marketing and increased the business intercourse between the two\r\nplaces more than fourfold. The lessees of the Fulton Ferry--the sole\r\nferry--had made an agreement in 1811, it was alleged, with the New York\r\nCity Corporation, by which the latter undertook to bind itself not to\r\nestablish any additional ferries from south of Catherine street to\r\nthe Village of Brooklyn for twenty-five years. The large landholders\r\ninfluenced the Common Council to continue this monopoly, their aim\r\nbeing to force the people to stay in New York, where rents were 35 per\r\ncent. higher than in any other city in the Union. The exactions of the\r\nwater, gas and steamboat monopolies likewise had a share in causing the\r\nformation of the Equal Rights party.\r\n\r\nBesides the dispensing to favored knots of citizens of trading\r\nprivileges and immunities which were withheld from the great body of\r\nthe community, the laboring element believed that there was a gross\r\ninequality of taxation in the interests of the rich. Taxes rose from\r\n$550,000 in 1832 to $850,000 in 1833, but the increase fell upon the\r\npoor. The Merchants’ Bank was assessed at $6,000; the lot and building\r\nhad cost that sum twenty years before, and were now worth at least\r\ntwice as much. The Merchants’ Exchange was assessed at $115,000, yet it\r\nwas known that the land and building had cost $800,000. Dozens of like\r\ninstances were cited by the reformers and they now determined upon a\r\nconcerted effort looking to better government.\r\n\r\nA powerful influence came to the aid of the Equal Rights men when\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant and William Leggett assumed the editorship of the\r\n_Evening Post_. This journal now advocated industrial and political\r\nreforms with singular independence and ability. It revived the original\r\nconception of the nominating committee’s functions. It urged the\r\nelectors to remember that the nomination by a nominating committee was\r\nbut a recommendation to the people of certain candidates whose merits\r\nand qualifications were as fair a matter of discussion as any under\r\nHeaven; and that it was for this very purpose that nominations were\r\nmade so long before the great popular meeting was convened. Besides\r\nhis editorial support of the movement, Leggett participated in the\r\npractical work of its organization and management. The clear thought\r\nand definite expression shown in most of the Equal Rights manifestoes\r\nand resolutions are perhaps directly due to him.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights faction became especially active in the Fall of\r\n1884. Its orators raised such a stir that both Tammany Hall and the\r\nWhigs suddenly developed an astonishing care for the workingmen. To\r\nconciliate them, the Tammany Nominating Committee exacted a written\r\npledge from every one of its candidates requiring an expression of his\r\nsentiments on the monopoly question. To counteract the Wigwam, the\r\nWhigs gathered a meeting of “Whig Mechanics” at Masonic Hall, October\r\n14, at which opposition to monopolies, especially banking monopolies,\r\nwas declared. Not to be outdone, the Wigwam got together a meeting\r\nof “Democratic Mechanics,” who resolved to oppose monopolies and to\r\nrestore the constitutional currency. Tammany also began to recognize,\r\neven more liberally than before, the naturalized citizens. As a\r\nconsequence, it won the Fall (1834) election by over 2,300 majority,\r\nmost of the Equal Rights men voting with it. One-third of its 18,000\r\nvoters were estimated at this time to be of foreign birth.\r\n\r\nNearly all the Tammany Assemblymen proceeded to forget their pledges,\r\nonly four of the delegation voting in the February following against\r\nthe bill giving exclusive privileges to the Peaconic Company.\r\n\r\nThe first clash between the Equal Rights faction and the Tammany\r\nmonopolists occurred at a meeting at the Wigwam on March 31, 1835.\r\nCertain that the Aldermen would never grant additional ferries, the\r\nEqual Rights men favored a measure, then pending in the Legislature,\r\nfor the establishment of a State Board of Commissioners clothed with\r\nthat power. Gideon Lee,[16] a Wall Street banker, called the meeting\r\nto order and nominated Preserved Fish for chairman. Many objections\r\nwere uttered, and Fish retired. The radicals howled down the Tammany\r\nspeakers and ran the meeting themselves, adopting resolutions prepared\r\nby Joel P. Seaver, declaring for the creation of the State board. A\r\nbill for a new ferry--the present South Ferry--was passed the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights men still hoped to gain their ends inside the\r\norganization. When Cornelius W. Lawrence[17] stood for reelection as\r\nMayor in April, 1835, there was scarcely any opposition to him from any\r\nquarter, he receiving 17,696 votes out of a total of 20,196.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall of 1835, however, the Tammany Nominating Committee\r\nrecommended for State offices candidates of a character most obnoxious\r\nto the Equal Rights men, and called a meeting for the evening of\r\nOctober 29, to ratify its nominations. Barely were the doors opened\r\nwhen the Equal Rights men rushed in and frustrated an attempt to\r\nplace Isaac L. Varian in the chair. In the mêlée, the Bank Democrats,\r\nfinding themselves unable to control the meeting, withdrew, but in\r\ndoing so turned off the gas, leaving the Equal Rights men in total\r\ndarkness. The trick must have been anticipated; for each man drew forth\r\na candle and a lucifer, or “loco foco” match, and in a twinkling the\r\nhall was resplendent with dancing lights. The Equal Rights men adopted\r\nresolutions and a suitable ticket of their own.[18]\r\n\r\nThree sets of candidates stood for election. The Native Americans, who\r\nopposed the election of foreigners to office and urged the repeal of\r\nthe naturalization laws, took the place of the Whigs. In the face of\r\nthis strong sentiment, Tammany Hall acted with its usual diplomacy. The\r\ngeneral committee boasted that the regular Tammany ticket was composed\r\nof only native Americans, which was true, the naturalized citizens\r\nhaving been cajoled on the promise of receiving the usual quota\r\namong nominations the next year. Of the nearly 23,000 votes cast at\r\nthe election, Tammany Hall obtained an average majority of about 800.\r\nThe Native Americans polled 9,000 votes, and the Equal Rights men, or\r\nAnti-Monopolists, over 3,500. It was estimated that 2,000 Whigs voted\r\nthe Tammany ticket to defeat the Anti-Monopolists, and that about 5,500\r\nWhig votes were divided between Tammany Hall and the Native Americans.\r\n\r\nThe news of its slight plurality was hailed with anything but pleasure\r\nat the Wigwam, where the Anti-Monopolists were denounced as political\r\nswindlers and adventurers. Instead, however, of making a show of\r\noutward fairness, the organization leaders blindly took the course\r\nmost adapted to fan the flame of opposition to themselves. After the\r\ngreat fire of 1835, which destroyed $20,000,000 worth of property, and\r\nthe extent of which was due to the refusal of the corrupt Aldermen\r\nto give the city a proper water supply, the Common Council agreed to\r\nloan $6,000,000 at 5 per cent. interest for the relief of insurance\r\ncompanies and banks which had suffered from the fire.[19] Nothing was\r\nsaid or done for the relief of the poor sufferers whom the Wigwam\r\nclaimed to have under its especial protection. The Council allowed\r\npawnbrokers 25 per cent. interest and prohibited them from loaning\r\nmore than $25 on a single pledge.[20] The city institutions were in\r\na melancholy state.[21] Most serious of all on the public mind were\r\nthe disclosures concerning the Commercial Bank, from which funds were\r\nembezzled in the scheme of cornering the stock of the Harlem Railroad.\r\nAs a step towards this end, Samuel Swartwout and Garrit Gilbert (a\r\nsometime Sachem) lobbied for the passage of a bill to increase the\r\ncapital stock of this road, which in turn, it was thought, would\r\nincrease the price of all the stock--two Senators agreeing to raise\r\nobjections temporarily “so as to blind the eyes of the New Yorkers.”[22]\r\n\r\nThe leaders made no effort to stop the granting of charters, or to\r\ncurtail the monopolist privileges already granted. It was admitted\r\ngenerally that no legislation even remotely affecting the interests\r\nof the banks could pass without the consent of those institutions.\r\nTradesmen also had their combinations. But combinations, legal enough\r\nwhen organized by capital, were declared illegal when formed by\r\nworkingmen. At this time the Supreme Court of the State of New York\r\ndecided that combinations to raise the wages of any class of laborers\r\namounted to a misdemeanor, on the ground that they were injurious\r\nto trade. Later, in June, 1836, twenty tailors were found guilty of\r\nconspiracy under that decision and fined by Judge Edwards $1,150 in the\r\naggregate for engaging in a strike for higher wages.\r\n\r\nThe mechanics prepared to hold an indignation meeting and applied for\r\npermission to use Tammany Hall. This was refused by the Sachems.[23]\r\nIn defiance of the Wigwam, the meeting, a gathering of 20,000 persons,\r\nwas held in the park fronting Tammany Hall. “Are workingmen,” read the\r\naddress of the committee of this meeting,\r\n\r\n    “free in reality when they dare not obey the first instinct of\r\n    all animated beings; when our courts pronounce it criminal to\r\n    exercise nature’s paramount law of self-preservation? Trades\r\n    unions and mechanick societies are only self-protective against\r\n    the _countless combinations of aristocracy_; boards of bank and\r\n    other chartered directories; boards of brokers; boards of trade\r\n    and commerce; combinations of landlords; coal and wood dealers;\r\n    monopolists and all those who grasp at everything and produce\r\n    nothing. If _all these combinations_ are suffered to exist, why\r\n    are trades unions and combinations of workingmen denounced?\r\n    Should they not have an equal chance in the pursuit of life,\r\n    liberty and happiness? Should they not have an equal right\r\n    with the other classes of society, in their person, in their\r\n    property or labor, and in their management?”\r\n\r\nThe meeting, in strong resolutions, condemned the Supreme Court\r\ndecision and that of Judge Edwards.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the peculiar Wigwam methods were being displayed in\r\nanother direction to an edified public. In the first days of May, 1836,\r\nthe Board of Aldermen found itself divided equally, Tammany Hall and\r\nthe Whigs each having eight votes, precluding either from electing a\r\npresident. The Tammany members, in the tea-room downstairs, made merry\r\nover refreshments. The Whigs could not muster a quorum, and sent word\r\nto the organization men to appear; the Wigwam men replied that they\r\ndidn’t choose, and bade the Whigs come to them. Meanwhile the public\r\nbusiness stood still. Finally the balloting was begun. On May 23,\r\nseventeen votes were found to have been cast, although there were only\r\nsixteen voting Aldermen.[24] By the end of May more than 120 ballots\r\nwere had. At last, on July 1, the Tammany men persuaded Alderman Ward,\r\na Whig, to offer a resolution electing Isaac L. Varian, a Wigwam\r\ncandidate, for the first six months, which was done.\r\n\r\nTaking these proceedings as a cue, the Equal Rights party, on June 6,\r\nat Military Hall, adopted a long series of resolutions stating that\r\nthe aristocracy of the Democracy, or in other words, the monopolists,\r\nthe paper-currency Democrats, the partizans of the “usages,” had\r\nlong deceived and misguided the great body of the Democrats. Through\r\nthese “usages,” the tools of the banks and other incorporated\r\nand speculative interests were enabled to take advantage of the\r\nunsuspicious self-security of the people, both before and at primary\r\nmeetings. By the aristocracy and through secret caucuses, candidates\r\nwere chosen, proceedings were cut and dried, and committees were\r\npacked. When committees could not be packed without opposition, the\r\nresolutions further read, two sets of committeemen were usually\r\nelected, and that set whose political complexion best suited the\r\npacked majority of the general committee was always accepted without\r\nany regard to the majorities of the people. The Union did not furnish\r\na more dangerous usurpation upon the sovereignty of the people than\r\nthe fact of the Tammany Hall Nominating Committee sending recently\r\na petition to the Legislature in favor of chartering more banks and\r\nbanking paper capital and designating themselves, not as citizens,\r\nbut as members of the nominating committee, notwithstanding the very\r\nnominees of such a committee had given their written pledge to oppose\r\nnew banks and monopolies.\r\n\r\nThe “usages,” the Equal Rights party next resolved, so productive of\r\nsecret caucuses, intrigues and abuses, furnished the avenue through\r\nwhich one portion of the Democracy had been corrupted, and the other\r\nportion--the great mass--led astray. The latter was taught to believe\r\nthat “usages” alone made men Democrats, and that to keep Federalists\r\nand Whigs out of office was the very essence of Democracy.[25]\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights party then nominated Isaac L. Smith, of Buffalo,\r\nfor Governor, and Moses L. Jacques, of New York City, for\r\nLieutenant-Governor.\r\n\r\nTo draw from the strength of the new party, some of Tammany’s\r\nleaders--Samuel Swartwout, Jesse Hoyt, Stephen Allen, Saul Alley and\r\na few others--professed to favor the repeal of the Restraining law,\r\nwhich in effect prohibited private banking and gave the incorporated\r\ninstitutions a monopoly. The Anti-Monopolists were not to be deluded.\r\nOn September 21 they declared that in the recent _professions_ of the\r\nTammany corruptionists in advocating this repeal and in favoring some\r\nother few _minor_ democratic measures, they beheld the stale expedient\r\nof luring the bone and sinew of the country to the support of their\r\nmonopoly and banking men and measures and that they had no faith in\r\nTammany “usages,” policy or its incorrigible Sachems.\r\n\r\nThe characters of most of the Wigwam nominations were so tainted that\r\nit seemed as if the candidates were put forward in defiance of the\r\nbest public sentiment. It is not so certain that outside the Equal\r\nRights party the voters were repelled by the current methods of buying\r\nlegislation and dictating nominations. A low tone of public morals was\r\nmanifested. Men were bent on money-making. He who could get rich by\r\ngrace of the Legislature was thought “smart” and worthy of emulation.\r\nThe successful in politics were likewise to be envied, and, if\r\npossible, imitated. A large part of the community bowed in respect to\r\nthe person of wealth, no matter whence came his riches; and the bank\r\nlobbyists were the recipients of a due share of this reverence.\r\n\r\nFrom these men the Tammany leaders selected candidates. One of the\r\nAssembly nominees was Prosper M. Wetmore, who had lobbied for the\r\nnotorious State Bank charter. This bank, according to the charter,\r\nwas to have $10,000,000 capital, although its organizers did not have\r\nmore than a mere fraction of that sum. This was going too far, even\r\nfor Albany, though upon modifying their application, the charter was\r\ngranted.[26] Reuben Withers and James C. Stoneall, bank lobbyists;\r\nBenjamin Ringgold, a bank and legislative “go-between,” and Morgan\r\nL. Smith, preeminent among lobbyists, were other Tammany nominees.\r\nNotwithstanding the low standards of public morals, these men were\r\nso unpopular, that when the form of submitting their names for\r\nratification to the great popular meeting at the Wigwam on November\r\n1, was carried out, a hostile demonstration followed. The names of\r\nWetmore, Smith and Ringgold especially were hooted. But the leaders had\r\ngroups of “whippers-in” brought in hurriedly to vote affirmatively, and\r\nthe presiding officer declared all the nominees duly accepted by the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nOnly six of the organization’s thirteen Assembly nominees survived\r\nthe popular wrath, and the nominees for nearly all the other offices\r\nwere beaten, notwithstanding the expectation that the Presidential\r\nelection would carry them in on the party ticket. A number of Tammany\r\nmen of principle refused to vote. The Whigs, the Native Americans and\r\nsome “Locofocos” joined forces. They were aided by the panic, which,\r\nbreaking out shortly before election, reacted against the Democrats.\r\nThe Equal Rights men as a rule voted for Van Buren. Tammany Hall and\r\nthe Whigs both committed frauds. Van Buren received 1,124 majority in\r\nNew York City, which in 1832 had given Jackson nearly 6,000 majority.\r\n\r\nMade wiser by defeat, the organization leaders realized the importance\r\nof the Equal Rights movement, and caused, as a sop, the passage, in\r\nFebruary, 1837, of the bill repealing the Restraining act. The Common\r\nCouncil likewise modified the Pawnbrokers’ act by cutting down the\r\ninterest to a more reasonable percentage.[27]\r\n\r\nTheir providence stopped at this point, however,[28] and during the\r\npanic Winter following neither Legislature nor Common Council did\r\nanything to alleviate the miseries of the poor. On the contrary,\r\nthe poor complained that the tendency more and more was to use the\r\npower of the law to make the rich richer. While the suffering was\r\ngreatest, Alderman Aaron Clark, a Whig, who had made his fortune from\r\nlotteries, proposed that the city spend several millions of dollars to\r\nsurround its water front with a line of still-water ponds for shipping\r\npurposes, his justification for this expenditure being that the North\r\nRiver piers would “raise the price of every lot 25 × 100 feet west\r\nof Broadway $5,000 at a jump.”[29] “Millions to benefit landowners\r\nand shippers, but not a dollar for the unemployed hungry!” exclaimed\r\nthe Anti-Monopolists. Alderman Bruen, another Whig, at a time when\r\nthe fall in the value of real estate in New York City alone exceeded\r\n$50,000,000, suggested the underwriting by the city to the speculators\r\nfor the sum of $5,000,000, to take in pledge the lands they had bought\r\nand to give them the bonds of the city for two-thirds their value.\r\nTo the Equal Rights men there was not much difference between the\r\nTammany Hall and the Whig leaders. Both, it was plain, sweated the\r\npeople for their own private interests, although the Whigs, inheriting\r\nthe Federalist idea that property was the sole test of merit, did not\r\nflaunt their undying concern for the laborer so persistently as did the\r\nWigwam.\r\n\r\nThe city in 1837 was filled with the homeless and unemployed. Rent was\r\nhigh, and provisions were dear. Cattle speculators had possession of\r\nnearly all the stock, and a barrel of flour cost $12. On February 12\r\na crowd met in the City Hall Park, after which over 200 of them sped\r\nto the flour warehouse of Eli Hart & Co., on Washington street. This\r\nfirm and that of S. B. Herrick & Son, it was known, held a monopoly\r\nin the scarce supply of flour and wheat. The doors of Hart’s place\r\nwere battered down, and nearly 500 barrels of flour and 1,000 bushels\r\nof wheat were taken out and strewed in the street. Herrick’s place\r\nlikewise was mobbed.[30] On May 10, when the banks suspended specie\r\npayments, a vast and excited crowd gathered in Wall Street, and a riot\r\nwas narrowly averted.[31]\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights party could not be bought out or snuffed out.\r\nTo deprive it of its best leaders Tammany Hall resorted to petty\r\npersecution. Jacques and Slamm had headed a petition to the Legislature\r\nprotesting against the appointment of a certain suspicious bank\r\ninvestigating committee. The Wigwam men in the Legislature immediately\r\nsecured the passage of a resolution for the appointment of a committee\r\nto investigate this petition, and this committee instantly haled\r\nJacques and Slamm to appear at Albany and give testimony.[32] The\r\npurpose was plain. The Tammany men sought to have the Equal Rights\r\nleaders at Albany, which was not as accessible from the city as now,\r\nand there keep them under various pretexts while the Spring campaign\r\nfor Mayor was going on. Jacques and Slamm did not appear and were\r\nadjudged guilty of contempt. When they were most needed in New York\r\nCity they were arrested and arraigned before the Legislature. William\r\nLeggett also was threatened, but escaped arrest.\r\n\r\nThe Equal Rights party, however, was soon to demonstrate its capacity\r\nto do harm to Tammany. The organization nominated John J. Morgan for\r\nMayor; the Whigs named Aaron Clark, and the Equal Rights party opposed\r\nthem with Jacques. The 3,911 votes Jacques received were enough to\r\ndefeat Morgan, with his 12,974 votes, against Clark’s 16,140. Worst\r\nblow of all, Tammany Hall lost the Common Council. When the new body\r\ncame in it removed all of the Wigwam’s office-holders that it could.\r\nThe spoils in the form of annual salaries paid by the city, amounting\r\nto $468,000; the perquisites and contracts--such as that for the Croton\r\nAqueduct, in favor of which the people had voted some years before--and\r\nother improvements, all went to the Whigs.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany men, regarding the Equal Rights men responsible for this\r\nloss of power, were now disposed to treat with them and willing enough\r\nto throw over the banker-corporation element.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The minutes of the Common Council covering these years show\r\ncontinuous records of petitions from imprisoned debtors, praying for\r\nfuel and the patching up of windows in the dead of Winter. Charitable\r\nsocieties were in existence to supply the jailed debtors with food.\r\n\r\n[2] This singular provision, by which non-residents were liable to\r\nimprisonment for debt, while the natives of the city were exempted, was\r\nerased in 1840.\r\n\r\n[3] _Journal of the Senate and Assembly_, 1805, pp. 351 and 399.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._, 1812, p. 134.\r\n\r\n[5] _Journal of the Senate and Assembly_, 1812, pp. 259-60.\r\n\r\n[6] Stock given at par value meant an almost immediate rise in value\r\nto the legislator.

Resolutions were then passed setting forth that whereas\r\nthe self-constituted, self-perpetuating Tammany Society had assumed a\r\ndictatorial attitude and by usages made by itself endeavored to rule\r\nthe people as with a rod of iron; and, as they (the Equal Rights men)\r\nbelieved the people were capable of managing their own affairs without\r\nthe aid of said inquisitorial society, “that we deem the Tammany\r\nSociety an excrescence upon the body politic and dangerous to its\r\nrights and liberties.”\r\n\r\n[24] _Proceedings of the Board of Aldermen_, Vol XI, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[25] These resolutions were published officially in the New York\r\n_Evening Post_, June 8, 1836.\r\n\r\n[26] Cornelius W.

The United States Bank dependents, lobbyists and supporters had\r\nleft the Wigwam, as has been noted, in 1832, but the State Bank men,\r\nwell satisfied with the destruction of the great rival corporation, had\r\nremained. Finding the organization no longer subservient to them they,\r\nin turn, quit Tammany during Van Buren’s administration.\r\n\r\nThis happened in the Fall of 1837. The Tammany General Committee, whose\r\nmembership had recently been increased from thirty-six to fifty-one\r\nmembers, held a meeting on September 7, thirty-six members being\r\npresent. Resolutions were offered upholding Van Buren’s scheme of\r\nplacing the United States funds in sub-treasuries. This was a bitter\r\ndose to the State Bank men who, wanting to retain Government deposits,\r\nopposed the sub-treasury plan. The “bank conservatives” vainly tried\r\nto put off a vote on the resolutions, but being repeatedly outvoted,\r\nall but one of them left the room before the main question was put.\r\nNineteen members remained. As seventeen formed a quorum, the question\r\nwas put and the resolutions were adopted by a vote of 18 to 1. The bank\r\nmen pretended that the resolutions were passed clandestinely, and they\r\nso deviously managed things that in a few days they regained control of\r\nthe general committee, which at their behest refused to call a public\r\nmeeting to act on the resolutions.\r\n\r\nBut the Democratic-Republican Young Men’s Committee was saturated with\r\nEqual Rights ideas and rebelled at the policy which allowed the acts\r\nof the bankers to antagonize Democrats of principle and bring defeat\r\nto Tammany Hall. This committee met in the Wigwam on September 11 and\r\npassed a series of resolutions with which the Anti-Monopolists were\r\nas pleased as the bankers were angry. The resolution declared the\r\npublic satisfaction in anticipating the separation of bank and state,\r\nand welcomed the approach of an era when legislation should not be\r\nperverted to the enrichment of a few and the depression of the many.\r\nThe Young Men resolved that the crisis was sufficient reason for their\r\ncommittee assuming to recommend a public meeting of those who approved\r\nVan Buren’s recent message, to be held in Tammany Hall, on September 21.\r\n\r\nThe bank men were angry that the Young Men’s committee should dare to\r\nact independently of the elder, the general committee. The latter,\r\nmeeting on September 14, disapproved of the manner in which the Young\r\nMen’s meeting had been called, declined cooperation with it, and by a\r\nvote of 21 to 16 ordered the Young Men’s General Committee to withdraw\r\nthe recommendation for that meeting. The Young Men ignored the order\r\nand held their meeting. Van Buren and his prospective sub-treasuries\r\nwere indorsed and fiery resolutions adopted denouncing the incorporated\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nComing, as this denunciation did, from Tammany Hall, which had a\r\nfar-reaching influence over the Union, the “bank conservatives”\r\ngrew even more exasperated, for they had come to look upon the\r\norganization as almost their private property. As two-thirds of the\r\nSachems belonged to their clique, they held a meeting in the Wigwam,\r\non September 25, to disapprove of the sub-treasury scheme. In rushed\r\nthe progressive Democrats in overwhelming force, and for an hour the\r\nplace was a fighting arena. The bank men were forced to leave, and the\r\nprogressives organized and carried out the meeting.\r\n\r\nRegarding Tammany as having ceased to be the tool of the exploiting\r\ninterests, the Anti-Monopolists were disposed to a union with the\r\nadvanced organization party. When the Equal Rights men met at\r\nMilitary Hall on October 27, Col. Alexander Ming, Jr., one of the\r\nparty’s organizers, said that one of the chief purposes of the Equal\r\nRights party was to effect reform in Tammany Hall; this having been\r\naccomplished, it was the duty of every Democrat to unite on one ticket\r\nagainst the “high-toned Federalists, Whigs and aristocrats.” A fusion\r\nAssembly ticket was made up, composed of both Tammany and Equal Rights\r\nmen, each Tammanyite subscribing in writing to the Equal Rights\r\nprinciples. A small contingent of the Equal Rights party, however,\r\naccused their comrades of selling out to the Wigwam, and nominated\r\ntheir own candidates--Job Haskell, Daniel Gorham, William E. Skidmore\r\nand others.\r\n\r\nThe “bank conservatives” allied themselves with the Whigs. They were\r\ncredited with raising an election fund of $60,000, a sum which at that\r\ntime could do great execution. By raising the cries of “agrarianism”\r\nand “infidelity,” ascribing the effects of the panic of 1837 to the\r\nDemocrats, coercing laborers and using illegal votes, the combined\r\nconservatives wrested nearly 3,000 majority out of a total of 33,093\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nStimulated by this victory, the bank men attempted to regain control\r\nof Tammany and called a meeting for January 2, 1838, at 7 o’clock, in\r\nthe Wigwam. The Anti-Bank Democrats then issued a call for a meeting\r\non the same night, but one hour earlier. The Council of Sachems were\r\nmostly either “bank conservatives” themselves or sympathizers; but they\r\nfeared to alienate the dominant progressives. As the best solution,\r\nthey agreed that neither party should meet in the Wigwam. On January\r\n1 they resolved that both calls were unauthorized and that neither\r\nhad been sanctioned by any act of the general committee. “The lease\r\nof Tammany Hall,” read their resolution, “reserves to the Council of\r\nSachems of the Tammany Society the right to decide on all questions of\r\ndoubt, arising out of the rooms being occupied by or let to a person\r\nor persons as a committee or otherwise for political purposes!” The\r\nCouncil sent a copy of these resolutions to Lovejoy and Howard, the\r\nlessees[1] of Tammany Hall, forbidding them to “rent, hire to, or allow\r\neither of the assemblages named on the premises.” Identical with this\r\ndecree, Lovejoy and Howard issued a notice (which was published in the\r\npublic prints) that their lease of Tammany Hall “contained covenants”\r\nthat they would not permit any persons to assemble in the hall “whose\r\npolitical opinions the Council of Sachems of Tammany Society should\r\ndeclare not to be in accordance with the political views of the general\r\ncommittee of said Tammany Society,” and they (Lovejoy and Howard)\r\ntherefore could not permit either meeting.[2] The conservatives then\r\nmet in the City Hall Park, where they were assaulted and maltreated.[3]\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Bank men won over the general committee, which gave the\r\nnecessary permission for their meeting in the Wigwam on January 9. The\r\npolicy of Jackson and of Van Buren was upheld, and it was set forth\r\nthat while the Democracy, unlike its calumniators, did not arrogate to\r\nitself “the possession of all the decency, the virtue, the morals and\r\nthe wealth of the community,” it felt no more disturbed at being called\r\n“Agrarians,” “Locofocos” or “Radicals” than it did at being abused in\r\nthe days of Jefferson.\r\n\r\nThat foremost Equal Rights advocate, the _Evening Post_, now\r\nacknowledged the purification of Tammany Hall;[4] saying that\r\nthe spurious Democrats who had infested the party for their own\r\nselfish purposes had either been drummed out of the ranks, had left\r\nvoluntarily, or had acquiesced sullenly in the decision of the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] It will be remembered that in 1828 the Sachems had bought back a\r\nlease on the building in order to shut out the Adams men. The lease had\r\nagain been let, but under restrictions which left the Sachems the power\r\nto determine what faction should be entitled to the use of the hall.\r\n\r\n[2] These details are of the greatest importance as revealing the\r\nmethods by which the society asserted its absolute ascendency over\r\nthe organization. They proved the absurdity of the claim that the two\r\nbodies were distinct and separate from each other.\r\n\r\n[3] The _New Yorker_ (magazine), January 13, 1838. This journal was\r\nedited and published by Horace Greeley.\r\n\r\n[4] January 11, 1838. The credit for this temporary purification must\r\nin considerable measure be given to the _Evening Post’s_ editors,\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant and William Leggett.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nWHIG FAILURE RESTORES TAMMANY TO POWER\r\n\r\n1838-1840\r\n\r\n\r\nThe course of the Whig city administration served only to strengthen\r\nTammany and was responsible for the conviction, which later so often\r\nprevailed, that if Tammany Hall was bad the Whigs were no better, and\r\nwere perhaps worse. At this time of general distress complaints were\r\nnumerous that the sum of $1,300,000 was exacted from the rentpayers in\r\na single year. In the early part of 1838 one-third of all the persons\r\nin New York City who subsisted by manual labor was substantially or\r\nwholly without employment.[1] Not less than 10,000 persons were in\r\nutter poverty and had no other means of surviving the Winter than those\r\nafforded by the charity of neighbors. The Almshouse and all charitable\r\ninstitutions were full to overflowing; the usual agencies of charity\r\nwere exhausted or insufficient, and 10,000 sufferers were still uncared\r\nfor. The great panic of 1837 had cut down the city’s trade one-half.\r\nNotwithstanding the fall of prices, the rents for tenements in New\r\nYork were greater than were paid in any other city or village upon\r\nthe globe.[2] So exorbitant were the demands of the landlords that\r\nthe tenants found it impossible to meet them. The landowners were the\r\nbackbone of the Whig party; it was not unnatural, therefore, that\r\ntheir rapacity developed among the people at large a profound distrust\r\nof Whig men and principles.\r\n\r\nThe Whig officials, so far as can be discovered, took no adequate steps\r\nto relieve the widespread suffering. The Tammany ward committees, on\r\nthe other hand, were active in relief work. This was another of the\r\nsecrets of Tammany Hall’s usual success in holding the body of voters.\r\nThe Whigs made fine speeches over champagne banquets, but kept at a\r\ndistance from the poor, among whom the Wigwam workers mingled, and\r\ndistributed clothing, fuel and food and often money. The leaders set\r\nthe example. One of these was John M. Bloodgood,[3] who frequently went\r\namong the charitable citizens, collecting, in a large basket, cakes,\r\npies, meat and other eatables, and distributing them among the needy.\r\n\r\nIn the Spring of 1838 Tammany nominated Isaac L. Varian for Mayor,\r\nand the Whigs renominated Aaron Clark. The Whigs used the panic as an\r\nexample of the result of Democratic rule. Controlling the city, they\r\nemployed all its machinery to win. It was reasonably certain that they\r\ndid not stop at fraud. In some wards canvassing was delayed until\r\nother wards were heard from. In still other wards the Whigs refused\r\nto administer the oath to naturalized citizens. With all this they\r\nobtained a plurality of only 519 out of 39,341 votes. Had it not been\r\nfor dissensions in the tumultuous Sixth Ward, Tammany would have won.\r\n\r\nIn the Fall election of 1838 the Whig frauds were enormous and\r\nindisputable. The Whigs raised large sums of money, which were handed\r\nto ward workers for the procuring of votes. About two hundred roughs\r\nwere brought from Philadelphia, in different divisions, each man\r\nreceiving $22. Gen. Robert Swartwout, now a Whig, at the instance\r\nof such men as Moses H. Grinnell, Robert C. Wetmore and Noah Cook,\r\nformer Wigwam lights, who left the Hall because the “destructionist”\r\nAnti-Monopolists captured it, arranged for the trip of these fraudulent\r\nvoters. After having voted in as many wards as possible, each was to\r\nreceive the additional compensation of $5. They were also to pass\r\naround spurious tickets purporting to be Democratic. The aggregate\r\nWhig vote, it was approximated, was swelled through the operations of\r\nthis band by at least five to six hundred.[4] One repeater, Charles\r\nSwint, voted in sixteen wards. Such inmates of the House of Detention\r\nas could be persuaded or bullied into voting the Whig ticket were set\r\nat large. Merritt, a police officer, was seen boldly leading a crowd\r\nof them to the polls. Ex-convicts distributed Whig tickets and busily\r\nelectioneered. The cabins of all the vessels along the wharves were\r\nransacked, and every man, whether or not a citizen or resident of New\r\nYork, who could be wheedled into voting a Whig ballot, was rushed to\r\nthe polls and his vote was smuggled in. The Whigs were successful,\r\ntheir candidate for Governor, William H. Seward, receiving 20,179\r\nvotes, to 19,377 for William L. Marcy.\r\n\r\nDeparting from its custom of seeking local victory on national issues,\r\nTammany, in April, 1839, issued an address expatiating on the increase\r\nof the city expenses from a little over $1,000,000 in 1830 to above\r\n$5,000,000 in 1838. Deducting about $1,500,000 for the Croton works,\r\nthere would still remain the enormous increase of $2,500,000. The\r\ncity population had not trebled in that time, nor had there been any\r\nextraordinary cause for expenditure. Where had all this money gone?\r\n\r\nTammany further pointed out that, unlike the Whigs, it had never\r\nstooped so low as to discharge the humble laborers in the public\r\nservice, when it (Tammany) held the Common Council. Nor had it ever\r\nbeen so abject as to provide them with colored tickets, as the Whigs\r\nhad done, so that the laborers might be detected if they voted contrary\r\nto their masters. Tammany further charged that the Whigs in the\r\nprevious election had taken the Almshouse paupers, with embossed satin\r\nvoting tickets in their hands, to the polls, and were planning to do it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nTammany made good use of this charge. But the practise was not\r\nexclusively a Whig industry. In those years both Democrats and Whigs,\r\naccording to which held power, forced Almshouse paupers to vote. For\r\na fortnight before the election the paupers were put in training. On\r\nthe morning of election they were disguised with new clothing, so that\r\nthe public might not see their gray uniforms. They were given tickets\r\nto vote “and tickets for grog, silver coin and also good advice as to\r\ntheir conduct at the polls.” Then they were carried to the polls in\r\nstages, with an officer on each step to see that none escaped. Many\r\nwould return to the Almshouse drunk and with torn clothing, or after\r\nhaving exchanged their new garments for liquor.[5] There were usually\r\nabout 300 paupers. In the Fall and Winter of 1838 a quarter of the\r\npopulation was relieved at the Almshouse.\r\n\r\nClark and Varian were both renominated for Mayor in the Spring of 1839.\r\nPreparations for fraud on a large scale were made by both parties. The\r\nnewspapers supporting Varian admitted that Tammany thought proper to\r\nfollow the Whigs’ example, and to counteract its effects, by colonizing\r\nthe doubtful wards with Democratic voters. On both sides repeating was\r\ngeneral. An Albany police officer named Coulson brought twenty-three\r\npersons, one of whom was only seventeen years old, to New York City,\r\nwhere they voted the Whig ticket in the different wards. For this they\r\nreceived $5 in advance, and $1 a day.\r\n\r\nOf the 41,113 votes Varian[6] received 21,072, and Clark 20,005. The\r\nWigwam secured a majority of 12 in the Common Council.\r\n\r\nFearing that Tammany in power would use the administration machinery\r\nin elections even more than had the Whigs, the latter now made a great\r\noutcry for a registry law,[7] proclaiming it the only fraud preventive.\r\nThe sudden conversion of the Whig leaders to civic purity called forth\r\nderision. But the people at large, the non-politicians, ashamed of such\r\nbarefaced frauds in their city, took up the agitation. The Registry\r\nbill was introduced in the Legislature in May, 1839. It provided for\r\nthe registration of voters in New York City, and made fraudulent voting\r\na felony, with severe penalties.\r\n\r\nAfter the frauds of 1834 the Wigwam leaders had given out that they\r\nwould take serious steps to obtain from the Legislature a law causing\r\nvoters to be registered, but had done nothing. They now opened a\r\ncampaign against the Whig bill. In the Spring of 1840 the ward\r\ncommittees declared against it on the pretext that it interfered with\r\nconstitutional rights; that it was an insidious attempt to take from\r\nthe poor man either his right of suffrage or to make the exercise of\r\nthat right so inconvenient as practically to debar him from voting.\r\nThe Common Council, on March 16, 1840, denounced the proposed law as\r\ninquisitorial, tyrannical and disfranchising in its effect, as well\r\nas unjust, because they (the Aldermen) “know of no sin which she (New\r\nYork City) has committed to make her worthy of the signal reproach now\r\nsought to be cast upon her.”[8] A few days later the Common Council\r\non joint ballot delivered itself of a solemn protest against the\r\nconstitutionality of the Registry bill, and on the night of March 24\r\nan assemblage in the Wigwam did likewise. It was in this year that the\r\nfull account of the Whig frauds of 1838 was made public. Commenting\r\nupon this, the Tammany Nominating Committee, with characteristic\r\nnaïveté, said in its address: “It is with shame that we record these\r\ndark transactions and proclaim them to the people. We would, if we\r\ncould, blot out their existence, for it brings disgrace on our whole\r\ncountry and will make the enemies of civil freedom laugh with joy.”\r\n\r\nThe Registry bill became a law, but Tammany continued to protest\r\nagainst it. When, in 1841, the Legislature increased the penalties\r\nfor its violation, Acting Mayor Elijah F. Purdy commented upon it\r\nseverely.[9]\r\n\r\nThe able, sincere and high-minded William Leggett, the guiding spirit\r\nof the Equal Rights party, died on May 29, 1839, not quite forty years\r\nold. The Tammany Young Men’s General Committee eulogized his virtues\r\nand talents, proclaimed him amongst the purest of politicians and\r\nannounced the purpose of raising a monument to his memory. Of this\r\ncommittee, curious to relate, the chairman was Fernando Wood and the\r\nsecretary Richard B. Connolly--two men who became known for anything\r\nbut devotion to the virtues they here exalted.\r\n\r\nLeggett, some years before this, had become a radical Abolitionist. By\r\nthis time the anti-slavery movement in the city and State had grown to\r\nconsiderable proportions, though as yet it had exercised but little\r\ninfluence on politics. Several riots had taken place in the streets of\r\nthe city, two rather serious ones happening on July 9 and 10, 1834,\r\nand June 21, 1835, and Lewis Tappan, an anti-slavery propagandist, had\r\nbeen mobbed. The local movement gradually acquired new adherents, and\r\nconstantly increased its propaganda. At this period, however, it was\r\nmore in the nature of a growing moral force.\r\n\r\nDuring this period another great series of disclosures regarding\r\nTammany chieftains was made public. Samuel Swartwout, whom Jackson\r\nhad made Collector of the Port shortly after coming into office in\r\n1829, fled from the city late in 1838. He had long been a power in the\r\norganization. His name had been mentioned unpleasantly when he, with\r\nM. M. Noah and Henry Ogden,[10] contrived by means of their official\r\npositions to get $10,000 reward for the recovery of the jewels stolen\r\nfrom the Prince of Orange, though the recovery had been made by others.\r\nAnd in 1833 he had threatened, as Collector of the Port, to remove the\r\nCustom House uptown because the merchants would not lend him more than\r\n$7,000 on the strength of some worthless “Jersey meadows.” Three years\r\nlater he was connected with the unsavory Harlem Railroad stock corner\r\nand the manipulation of the funds of the Commercial Bank. Early in 1838\r\nhe joined forces with the notorious politicians of the Seventh Ward\r\nBank for the defeat of William Leggett for the Democratic nomination\r\nfor Congress, securing the nomination of Isaac L. Varian in his\r\nstead. A few months later the city was astounded to learn that since\r\n1830 he had been systematically robbing the Government, through the\r\nmanipulation of Custom House receipts, and that the total of his thefts\r\namounted to nearly $1,250,000.[11] Fleeing to Europe, he wandered\r\naimlessly about[12] for many years.[13] The community was so impressed\r\nwith the size of this defalcation that a verb, “to Swartwout,” was\r\ncoined, remaining in general use for many years thereafter. A defaulter\r\nwas generally spoken of as having “Swartwouted.”\r\n\r\nA lesser figure in Tammany circles, though a person of considerable\r\nconsequence, followed Swartwout in flight. This was William M. Price,\r\nat the time District Attorney for the Southern District of New York. It\r\nwas discovered that he had defaulted to the Government in the sum of\r\n$75,000. Price, like so many other Tammany politicians of his time, had\r\nbeen mixed up with Seventh Ward Bank politics. During the latter part\r\nof his career he had been known as the personal representative in the\r\ncity of President Van Buren.\r\n\r\nDuring the following Spring, William Paxen Hallett, a member of the\r\n“Big Four” against whom the Equal Rights party had so energetically\r\nprotested in 1836, was made the defendant in a civil suit involving\r\ngrave fraud. As referee in a suit for damages of one John A. Manning\r\nagainst one Charles J. Morris, Hallett had wrongfully reported that\r\nonly trifling judgments remained outstanding against Morris, and the\r\ncourt had accordingly given the latter a year’s time in which to make\r\ngood a judgment for $3,496 rendered in favor of Manning. It appeared,\r\nhowever, in the proceedings before the Superior Court, May 20, 1839,\r\nthat Hallett knew, or should have known, of a previous judgment\r\nagainst the defendant for $15,014.44 in favor of one Nathan Davis, who\r\nduring the year of grace seized upon all of Morris’s property, thus\r\ndefrauding Manning. The testimony was so convincing that Hallett was\r\nforced to compromise the suit by paying the damages asked for. Through\r\nthe influence of the organization, however, he escaped prosecution.\r\n\r\nThe “ring” of Police Justices had for several years been a crying\r\nscandal. Whig and Tammany magistrates were equally involved. Public\r\nclamor fixed upon John M. Bloodgood, despite his private charities,\r\nas the first victim. The Assistant Aldermen impeached him in January,\r\n1839,[14] and submitted the case to the Court of Common Pleas, by\r\nwhom he was tried.[15] Testimony was brought out tending to show that\r\nthe Police Justices, by means of an understanding with policemen and\r\njailers, extorted money from prisoners and shielded counterfeiters,\r\nthieves, street walkers and other malefactors from arrest or\r\nconviction. The charges were dismissed.[16] Stronger testimony of the\r\nsame kind was brought out in May, 1840, on the trial of Police Justice\r\nHenry W. Merritt, and other testimony involved in the same way Special\r\nJustice Oliver M. Lowndes. The case, however, was dismissed.[17]\r\n\r\nA strong public agitation had been waged for the reorganization of the\r\ncriminal courts. The _Weekly Herald_ of February 1, 1840, had made the\r\nstatement that the farce of conducting the correctional machinery of\r\nthe city involved a yearly sum of $1,360,564--this sum being the total\r\nof judges’, policemen’s and court attendants’ salaries (about $50,000),\r\nadded to the blackmail exacted from offenders, and various “pickings\r\nand stealings.” The statement was an extravagant one; $700,000 would\r\nhave been nearer the mark. But whatever the sum, the acquittal of the\r\nPolice Justices by their fellows in judicial evil-doing indicated that\r\nthe carnival was to continue. The Tammany leaders had been “out” for\r\nthe two years 1837-38, and were now vigorously making hay while the sun\r\nshone, while such of their Whig contemporaries as still held office\r\nwere vying with the chiefs in systematic and organized plundering.\r\n\r\nThe Manhattan Bank scandals were made public in February, 1840. This\r\nwas the bank whose charter Aaron Burr had so ingeniously secured in\r\n1799. It had been a Tammany institution from the beginning, and Tammany\r\npoliticians had ruled its policies. It was now generally regarded as\r\nthe leading financial institution in the city, rivaled only by the Bank\r\nof America. It carried $600,000 of Government funds on deposit, and, of\r\ncourse, a large city and State fund.\r\n\r\nIt was now shown that for years it had loaned large sums to Tammany\r\nleaders and to family connections of its directors and officials, and\r\nthat it had spent other large sums for political purposes. The total\r\nof its worthless loans and political expenditures reached the enormous\r\nsum of $1,344,266.99. Cashier Campbell P. White, tried on the technical\r\ncharge of stealing several of the bank’s books, was freed through the\r\ndisagreement of the jury,[18] but on a second trial, charged with\r\nassaulting Jonathan Thompson, a Tammany director of the bank who had\r\ncriticized his management, he was fined $250 and imprisoned for fifteen\r\ndays.[19] In the midst of the excitement Colin G. Newcomb, the teller,\r\ndisappeared with $50,000. That the bank weathered the storm well-nigh\r\nreaches the dimensions of a miracle. Paulding, twice a Tammany Mayor;\r\nBowne, another Tammany ex-Mayor; and Robert H. Morris, at that time\r\nRecorder, appeared as the defendant’s witnesses in the first trial.\r\nWhite was an influential Wigwam chief, and in 1832 had been elected to\r\nCongress on the Tammany ticket.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The _New Yorker_, January 20, 1838.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, February 17, 1838.

Sir\r\nCharles Lyell, the noted British geologist, once asked him questions\r\nas to the formation of Manhattan Island. Varian said he had dug a well\r\non his farm at Murray Hill and after going through “a stratagem of\r\nsand and a stratagem of clay they struck a stratagem of red rock.” At\r\nanother time, while reading a New York newspaper at the Stanwix House\r\nin Albany, Varian remarked to Walter Bowne, then Mayor, that they had a\r\nnew Street Inspector in New York City. “Indeed! who is he?” “A perfect\r\nstranger,” replied Varian; and he read from the paper: “‘Last evening\r\nthe wind suddenly changed to the north, and this morning, thanks to Old\r\nBoreas, our streets are in a passable condition.’ Old Boreas,” said\r\nVarian, reflectively, “I thought I knew every Democrat in New York, but\r\nI never heard of him.”\r\n\r\n[7] In 1834 the Board of Assistant Aldermen had passed a resolution in\r\nfavor of the registry of voters, and the Native American Association,\r\nearly in 1838, had petitioned the Legislature similarly.

At the\r\ntime of Swartwout’s flight he was the Cashier of the Custom House, a\r\npost which he had held for several years.

(These records are neither paged nor indexed.) The Common\r\nPleas of this time was popularly known as the Mayor’s Court; and the\r\nJudges were the Mayor, Recorder and certain Aldermen. The later Court\r\nof Common Pleas was not established until 1856.\r\n\r\n[16] A curious reason for the dismissal was given in the decision of\r\nthe Judges. It was that the charges had not been individually sworn to.\r\nIt appeared, therefore, that the Board of Assistant Aldermen, acting in\r\nits official capacity in formulating impeachment proceedings, was not a\r\nrecognizable party before the Court of Common Pleas.\r\n\r\n[17] _Journal and Documents of the Board of Assistant Aldermen_,\r\n1839-40, Vol. XV, No. 71.

After its absorption of the Equal\r\nRights party, the organization had remained “purified” for a year or\r\nso, and then, as usual, had relapsed. But a new power and new ideas\r\nprevailed. No longer did the bankers and merchants who once held\r\nthe Wigwam in their grasp, venture to meet in the secret chamber of\r\nthe hall and order nominations, command policies or determine the\r\npunishment of refractory individuals. Tammany from this time forward\r\nbegan to be ruled from the bottom of the social stratum, instead of\r\nfrom the top.\r\n\r\nSomething had to be done to offset the disclosures of 1838-40.\r\nAccordingly, the policy of encouraging the foreigners, first rather\r\nmildly started in 1823, was now developed into a system. The Whigs\r\nantagonized the entrance of foreign-born citizens into politics, and\r\nthe Native American party was organized expressly to bar them almost\r\nentirely from the enjoyment of political rights. The immigrant had\r\nno place to which to turn but Tammany Hall. In part to assure to\r\nitself this vote the organization opened a bureau, a modest beginning\r\nof what became a colossal department. An office was established in\r\nthe Wigwam, to which specially paid agents or organization runners\r\nbrought the immigrant, drilled into him the advantages of joining\r\nTammany and furnished him with the means and legal machinery needed\r\nto take out his naturalization papers. Between January 14 and April 1,\r\n1840, 895 of these men were taken before Tammany Marine Court Judges\r\nand naturalized. Judges of other courts helped to swell the total.\r\nNearly every one of these aliens became and remained an inveterate\r\norganization voter. Tammany took the immigrant in charge, cared for\r\nhim, made him feel that he was a human being with distinct political\r\nrights, and converted him into a citizen. How sagacious this was,\r\neach year revealed. Immigration soon poured in heavily, and there\r\ncame a time when the foreign vote outnumbered that of the native-born\r\ncitizens.[1]\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were bewildered at this systematic gathering in of the\r\nnaturalized citizens. After the election of April, 1840,[2] when\r\nTammany reelected Varian Mayor and carried the Common Council, the\r\nCommittee of Whig Young Men[3] issued a long address on the subject.\r\nAfter specifically charging that prisoners had been marched from their\r\ncells in the City Prison by their jailers to the polls to vote the\r\nTammany ticket, the address declared that during the week previous to,\r\nand on election day, naturalization papers had been granted at the\r\nMarine Court on tickets from Tammany Hall, under circumstances of great\r\nabuse.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1840 the so-called best elements of the town\r\nwere for General Harrison. The Wigwam men had much at stake in Van\r\nBuren’s candidature and exerted themselves to reelect him. Tammany now\r\nelaborated its naturalization bureau. A committee sat daily at the\r\nWigwam, assisting in the naturalization process, free of charge to the\r\napplicant. The allegiance of foreign-born citizens was further assured\r\nby humoring their national pride in the holding of Irish, German and\r\nFrench meetings in the hall, where each nationality was addressed in\r\nits own language. The more influential foreigners were rewarded with\r\nplaces on the Assembly or local ticket, and to the lesser workers of\r\nforeign birth were given petty jobs in the department offices, or\r\ncontract work.\r\n\r\nThe outcome was, that in the face of especially strong opposition\r\nTammany harvested 982 plurality in the city for Van Buren, though\r\nthe vote of the Western counties gave Harrison the electoral vote\r\nof the State. It was such instances as this--demonstrating its\r\ncapacity of swaying New York City even if the rest of the State voted\r\noppositely--that continued to give Tammany Hall a powerful hold on the\r\nDemocratic party of the nation, notwithstanding the discredit that so\r\noften attached to Tammany men and measures.\r\n\r\nAnother example of the change in the personnel of Tammany was shown in\r\nthe rise and progress of the “ward heeler” and his “gangs.” The “gangs”\r\nwere not conspicuous in 1841, when the organization elected Robert H.\r\nMorris Mayor.[4] In April, 1842, when Morris was reelected,[5] the\r\n“gangs” were still modestly in the background. But in the Fall of that\r\nyear they came forth in their might.\r\n\r\nOne of their leaders was “Mike” Walsh, who became a sort of example\r\nfor the professional “ward heelers” that followed in his wake. Walsh\r\nhad no claim at all on the ruling politicians at the Wigwam, and would\r\nhave been unnoticed by them. But he was ambitious, did not lack ability\r\nof a certain kind, and had a retinue of devoted “plug-ugly” followers.\r\nHe spoke with a homely eloquence, which captivated the poor of his\r\nward. The turbulent he won over with his fists. On November 1 the\r\nTammany Nominating Committee reported to the great popular meeting.\r\nWalsh, with the express purpose of forcing his own nomination for the\r\nAssembly, went there with such a band of shouters and fighters as\r\nnever before had been seen in the hall. His “shoulder-hitters”--men,\r\nas a rule, of formidable appearance--did such hearty execution and so\r\noverawed the men assembled there, that upon the question being put\r\nto a vote the general committee decided in his favor and placed his\r\nname on the regular ticket. While in the ensuing election he received\r\nnot quite 3,000 votes to the nearly 20,000 cast for his opponent (the\r\nnominee first reported by the committee), he eventually was successful\r\nin his aim. Seeing how easy it was to force nominations at the Wigwam\r\nif backed by force, other men began to imitate him and get together\r\n“gangs” of their own.\r\n\r\nThis was the kind of men who, with their “gangs,” superseded the former\r\nDemocratic ward committees, nearly every member of which kept a shop or\r\nearned his living in some legitimate calling. By helping one another\r\nin introducing “gangs” of repeaters from one ward to another at the\r\nprimary elections, the “ward heelers” became the masters of the wards\r\nand were then graduated into leaders, whose support was sought by the\r\nmost dignified and illustrious politicians.\r\n\r\nIn fact, the city was frequently in a state of turmoil. Since 1834\r\nthere had been half a dozen riots.[6] There were constant fights\r\nbetween rival volunteer engine companies, to which lawless and\r\nabandoned characters attached themselves. Engines were stolen, clubs,\r\npipes, wrenches and other weapons were used, and the affrays generally\r\nclosed with stabbings and broken skulls.[7] There was no police\r\nforce to speak of; even Mayor Morris, whom the “gangs” called “Bob”\r\nand tapped familiarly on the shoulder, described it as “lamentably\r\ndefective.”[8] One out of every twenty-one white persons in the city\r\ncould not read and write.[9] From so large a population of illiterates,\r\nthe “ward heelers” easily recruited great numbers of followers. Morris\r\nallowed the “gangs” full sway, and was popular accordingly. Naturally,\r\nwith this encouragement, the “gangs” grew and became ever bolder.\r\n\r\nGeneral disgust at the low character of politics was felt by the\r\nindependents, who rightly held both Tammany and the Whigs responsible.\r\nDuring the time each party held power affairs had gone from bad to\r\nworse. A joint special committee of Aldermen, appointed under public\r\npressure, reported, in 1842, that dishonest office-holders had\r\nrecently robbed the city of little short of $100,000.[10] A street\r\ncleaning contract was awarded for $64,500 a year, for five years, when\r\nother responsible persons offered to take it for not quite $25,000\r\na year.[11] The fraudulent selling of city land to cover up the\r\nincreasing debt was continued.[12] The city office-holders sold real\r\nestate for unpaid assessments, frequently without giving notice to the\r\nowner, and bought it in themselves and so “possessed themselves of\r\nestates.”[13] Heavy and oppressive assessments for improvements never\r\nactually made were laid on the taxpayers.[14] Hundreds of thousands of\r\ndollars were expended uselessly and extravagantly.[15] Mayor Morris\r\ncomplained that he had no power over expenditures; that he knew nothing\r\nof legislative action on public works until the warrants for payment\r\nwere sent to him.[16] In violation of the charter, the Aldermen\r\nparticipated in all the profitable “jobs.”[17]\r\n\r\nConvicts were allowed to escape from Blackwell’s Island on condition\r\nthat they voted as their keepers ordered them.[18] Prisoners whose\r\nterms had expired were kept at the public expense until election day,\r\nto get their votes. The inmates of the Almshouse and the Penitentiary\r\nwere forced to manufacture articles for the use and profit of the\r\nofficers of those departments. “It is a well-known fact to all who\r\nhave been familiar with those establishments,” declared the Almshouse\r\nCommissioners, “that large quantities of cabinet furniture, clothing\r\nand sometimes elegant carriages, cut-glass decanters, punch-bowls, and\r\nother articles have been made at the expense of the city; and this has\r\nbeen carried on more or less for years.”[19] It was the custom of the\r\nofficers “to expend large sums in sumptuous and costly dinners for the\r\nentertainment of partizans.” Persons confined in the City Prison were\r\nfrequently swindled out of their money or effects by the officers, or\r\nby “shyster” lawyers, acting in connivance with the jailers; and to\r\nget a mere note or message delivered to friends they had to pay an\r\nexorbitant price.[20]\r\n\r\nDespite the disclosures, Tammany again elected Morris, in April, 1843,\r\nby nearly 5,000 plurality, he receiving 24,395 votes to 19,516 for\r\nRobert Smith, the Whig candidate. The storm, however, was gathering,\r\nboth in and out of Tammany. Inside the organization, charges were\r\ncommon of monstrous frauds in the primaries. Frauds against the Whigs\r\nwere acceptable enough, but by Democrats against Democrats were\r\nintolerable. So pronounced was the outcry over these frauds that the\r\nTammany General Committee, in the Fall of 1843, directed that in\r\nfuture the ward meetings should be held on the same night and that\r\nonly those whose names appeared on the poll lists should be allowed to\r\nvote.[21]\r\n\r\nOutside criticism materialized in an independent reform movement. It\r\nfound a rallying point in the Native American or American Republican\r\nparty, which previously had polled about 9,000 votes. It resented\r\nthe intrusion of foreigners into politics, large numbers of whom had\r\nsecured office. It was partially industrial in its character and\r\nfollowing; numbers of American workingmen believed that with 100,000\r\nimmigrants[22] pouring into this country every year they would soon\r\nhave to be satisfied with a shilling or twenty cents a day for their\r\nlabor, instead of $1.50 they were receiving. The native element also\r\ncomplained of the organization of the Irish into a distinct and\r\nseparate element, with a high Roman Catholic prelate at its head, in\r\norder to get part of the public school funds. The discussion of the\r\npublic school question only the more accentuated hatreds, bringing to\r\nthe surface the most delicate questions touching the religious feelings\r\nand prejudices of the major part of the community.\r\n\r\nTammany nominated Jonathan I. Coddington for Mayor, and placed very few\r\nnaturalized citizens on its ticket. The Native American candidate was\r\nJames Harper, and the Whig, Morris Franklin.\r\n\r\nMayor Morris called a meeting in Tammany Hall at which resolutions\r\nwere passed denouncing the Common Council for its corruption and its\r\nfailure to carry out reform. The advocates of the new party declared\r\nthat they were not to be deceived. Their campaign was carried on with\r\nvigor. Honest men generally were roused against both Tammany and the\r\nWhigs. Religious and racial vituperation were partially cast aside and\r\nforgotten for the time when the reform men took hold of the movement;\r\nnot wholly so, however, for we find one of the chief native orators\r\ndeclaring in a campaign speech that “the American Republicans will not\r\nbe found with Roman Catholics in the same ranks.” This bigotry was\r\noverlooked, inasmuch as the Native Americans promised city reform, good\r\npolice, reductions in taxes, clean streets and economical expenditure\r\nof the public money. The community was pervaded by a profound sense\r\nof the corruption and inefficiency of the old parties, and ordinary\r\npolitical lines were forgotten.\r\n\r\nTammany made desperate efforts to carry the election. On the preceding\r\nnight, convicts in batches of twenty and thirty were taken from\r\nBlackwell’s Island to New York, where they were lodged, and the next\r\nday given Democratic ballots, free lunch and in some instances were\r\nemployed to electioneer.[23]\r\n\r\nThe Native Americans won, however, the vote standing: Harper, 24,606;\r\nCoddington, 20,726; Franklin, 5,207.\r\n\r\nThe new administration was a distinct disappointment. Though it had\r\na majority in the Common Council, it accomplished few or none of\r\nthe reforms its supporters had promised. The scramble for office\r\ncontinued as before; municipal improvements progressed slowly, and\r\nthough salaries and appropriations were cut to some extent, taxes\r\nand expenditures increased. A part of this increase was doubtless\r\njustified, but the people had been promised reduction, and they refused\r\nto take into account the fiscal needs of a rapidly growing city. The\r\nadministration further weakened its hold by passing and enforcing\r\nstringent “blue laws.” Not only were the unfortunate women of the\r\nstreets warred upon and quiet drinking places raided, but irritating\r\nmeasures, such as the prohibiting of fireworks on the Fourth of July\r\nand the driving of apple women and other vendors from the streets, were\r\ntaken. The result was a public reaction.\r\n\r\nMayor Harper was a quaint character, and his odd rulings when presiding\r\nin Special Sessions were the talk of the town. If a shoemaker, for\r\ninstance, was arraigned before him, he would say: “Well, we want\r\nshoemakers on the island, so we’ll send you up for three months, and be\r\nsmart while you _last_, John, be smart.” Or, in the instance of a man\r\nwho claimed to be “a sort of carpenter”: “Well, we’ll send you up for\r\ntwo months to round your apprenticeship, and the city will take care of\r\nyour lodging and board, Matthew.”\r\n\r\nIn the reaction that set in, many voters swung back to Tammany on\r\nthe general belief that it was no worse than the other parties. This\r\nchange of sentiment put the organization in good form to carry the\r\ncity for James K. Polk in November, 1844. A short time before this\r\nthere had come into distinction one of the most effective auxiliaries\r\nof the Wigwam. This was the Empire Club,[24] of No. 28 Park Row. Its\r\nchief was Captain Isaiah Rynders, and its membership was made up of a\r\nchoice variety of picked worthies who could argue a mooted point to a\r\nfinish with knuckles. Rynders had a most varied career before entering\r\nNew York politics. A gambler in New Orleans, he mixed in some bowie\r\nand pistol fights there in which he was cut severely on the head and\r\nelsewhere, and his hat was perforated by a bullet. On a Mississippi\r\nsteamboat he drove O’Rourke, a pugilist, out of the saloon with a\r\nred-hot poker, after O’Rourke had lost at faro and had attempted to\r\nkill the winner. These were but a few of his many diversions. In\r\nWashington he was arrested with Breedlove and Jewell on suspicion of\r\nbeing connected with the theft of a large sum in Treasury notes, though\r\nno proof was found against him. He was a very considerable power in\r\nthe Wigwam for over twenty years, frequently officiating at meetings\r\nthere. Chief among the club’s other members of like proclivities were\r\nsuch noted fighters and “unterrified Democrats” as “Country McCleester”\r\n(McClusky), “Bill” Ford, “Manny” Kelly, John Ling, “Mike” Phillips,\r\n“Bill” Miner, “Denny” McGuire, “Ike” Austin, “Tom” McGuire, “Tom”\r\nFreeman and “Dave” Scandlin. After the nomination of Henry Clay,\r\n“Johnny” Austin--a common report of the day had it--was offered the\r\nsum of $2,000 to bring himself and five of his associates--McClusky,\r\nKelly, Ford, Scandlin and Phillips--into the Unionist Club (a Whig\r\norganization) with the hope that they could secure success to the Whigs\r\nin the city. Offices also were promised, but the offers were refused;\r\nwhether because the Wigwam held forth greater inducements is not clear.\r\n\r\nAided by these worthies, and by the popular indignation against the\r\nreform administration, the Wigwam men grew confident. They were now\r\nheard boasting that they intended electing their entire ticket. There\r\nbeing no longer fear of the Registry law (which the Wigwam had recently\r\ninfluenced a friendly Legislature to repeal on the ground of its\r\ndiscriminative application to New York City alone), fraud was open and\r\ngeneral. The vote on its face proved this; since, while New York City\r\ncould claim a legitimate vote of only 45,000, the Polk electors were\r\ncredited with 28,216, and the Clay electors with 26,870 votes. For\r\nJames G. Birney, the Abolition candidate, but 118 votes were polled, or\r\nat least counted.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany General Committee, on January 13, 1845, passed resolutions\r\nfavoring the annexation of Texas and calling a public meeting. With a\r\nview of glorifying John Tyler--to whom they owed their positions--and\r\nat the same time of winning the good will of the incoming\r\nadministration, the Custom House officers tried to anticipate the\r\ncommittee’s action, but were not allowed to use the hall. Resolved,\r\nat any rate, to control the meeting regularly called, they crowded two\r\nthousand of their creatures, under the leadership of Rynders, into\r\nthe Wigwam. The meeting was soon one of uproar, turbulence and some\r\nfighting. Rynders had his resolutions adopted “amid yells, shouts,\r\nscreams, oaths, cheers, blasphemy, hisses and an uproar never before\r\nknown in the pandemonium of politics.” It was the generally expressed\r\nopinion that the time had come when the proceedings of a meeting at\r\nTammany Hall were no longer to be considered as any certain indication\r\nof the opinions of the Democratic party; that a class of men who\r\nchose to organize themselves for the purpose, by being early on the\r\nground, acting in concert and clamoring according to certain understood\r\nsignals, could carry any set of resolutions they pleased, in the very\r\nteeth of the large majority of the Democratic party.\r\n\r\nIn the local campaign of 1845 Tammany acted sagaciously. It nominated\r\nWilliam F. Havemeyer for Mayor, laying stress on the fact that he was\r\na “native New Yorker.” The Native Americans renominated Harper, and\r\nthe Whigs, Dudley Selden. The vote stood: Havemeyer, 24,183, Harper,\r\n17,472; Selden, 7,082. Tammany secured a majority of 26 on joint ballot\r\nin the Common Council--the real power.\r\n\r\nMayor Havemeyer sincerely tried to effect reforms. In the beginning\r\nof his term he urged the fact that the Common Council united in\r\nitself nearly all the executive with all the legislative power,\r\nand declared that its main business was to collect and distribute,\r\nthrough the various forms of patronage, nearly a million and a half\r\ndollars a year.[25] His attacks upon the arbitrary powers and corrupt\r\npractises of the Common Council made so little impression upon that\r\nbody that on May 13, the very first day of convening, the Aldermen,\r\nimmediately after the reading of the Mayor’s message, removed not\r\nless than seventy officials, from the heads of departments to Street\r\nInspectors;[26] and on subsequent days the process was continued until\r\nevery post was filled with a Tammany man.\r\n\r\nBut the effect upon the public mind was such that in 1846 a new charter\r\nwas drafted and adopted, which deprived the Common Council of the power\r\nwhich it hitherto had enjoyed of appointing the heads of departments,\r\nand gave their election direct to the people.\r\n\r\nMayor Havemeyer not being pliable enough for the Wigwam leaders, they\r\nnominated and elected, in the Spring of 1846, Andrew H. Mickle, by a\r\nvote of 21,675, the Whigs receiving 15,111, and the Native Americans\r\n8,301.[27] Mayor Mickle was regarded as “one of the people.” He was\r\nborn in a shanty in the “bloody ould Sixth,” in the attic of which a\r\ndozen pigs made their habitation. Marrying the daughter of the owner of\r\na large tobacco house, he later became its proprietor. He improved his\r\nopportunities, business and official, so well that he died worth over a\r\nmillion dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The statement was made at a reform meeting in City Hall Park on\r\nApril 11, 1844, that from 1841 to 1844 not less than 11,000 foreigners\r\nhad been naturalized at $1 a head, though the legal fee was $5. The\r\nJudges, the speaker said on the authority of Judge Vanderpoel, signed\r\ntheir names to the papers without asking questions.\r\n\r\n[2] This was the first election in the city occupying only one day.\r\nBefore 1840 three days were used.

The\r\nnickname was occasioned by the saying of a contractor, a few years\r\nbefore: “These men are incendiaries; they are mad; they are like the\r\nfarmer, who, to get the rats out of his granary, sets fire to his own\r\nbarn.”\r\n\r\nThe “Hunkers” were the office-holding conservatives, very unwilling\r\nto have anything disturb their repose, and above all, opposed to the\r\nagitation of the slavery question. Their influence was thrown wherever\r\npossible with the slaveholding States. The term “Hunkers” arose from\r\ntheir characteristic of striving to keep their offices to the exclusion\r\nof everybody else--“to get all they can and keep all they can get.”[1]\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was as sharply defined throughout the State as in New\r\nYork City. Such men as Samuel J. Tilden, C. C. Cambreleng, William\r\nF. Havemeyer and Minthorne Tompkins were the local leaders of the\r\n“Barnburners”; John McKeon, Lorenzo B. Shepard,[2] a brilliant young\r\nleader who was a noted orator at the early age of 19; Edward Strahan\r\nand Emanuel B. Hart were some of the chiefs of the “Hunkers.” This\r\nfactional struggle, together with the dissatisfaction given by the city\r\nadministration, weakened Tammany, whose nominee, in the Spring election\r\nof 1847, J. Sherman Brownell, was defeated by the Whig candidate,\r\nWilliam V. Brady. The vote stood: Brady, 21,310; Brownell, 19,877;\r\nEllis G. Drake (Independent), 2,078. This was the first time in nine\r\nyears that the city had been carried by the Whigs proper, though they\r\nwere aided somewhat by the Native Americans.\r\n\r\n“Barnburners” and “Hunkers” laid aside their differences momentarily\r\nwhen President Polk visited the city in June, 1847, one of his objects\r\nbeing to be initiated a member of the Tammany Society. On June 26 he\r\nwas waited upon at the Astor House by a deputation of the society,\r\nheaded by Elijah F. Purdy. Quite worn out after a torrid day of\r\nhandshaking, Polk accompanied his escorts to the large room in the\r\nWigwam, where members of the society were usually initiated. Later,\r\nthe President emerged, looking happy at having availed himself of\r\nmembership in a political society which could sway Presidential choices\r\nand elections and perhaps determine his own future political fate.\r\n\r\nThis incident past, the factions resumed their quarrel and warred so\r\neffectually that in the general election of November, 1847, the Whigs\r\nagain won, by more than 3,000 votes. But Tammany, in its darkest\r\nmoments, was fertile in expedients. It now arranged a great meeting for\r\nFebruary 5, 1848, in commendation of the Mexican War. Sam Houston and\r\nGeneral Foote made speeches, and one of the Tammany orators assured\r\nthe audience that though Tammany Hall “erred sometimes,” its “patriotic\r\nardor was never cooled.” The success of this war brought thousands of\r\nvoters back to the Democratic ranks in the city. Besides, “Barnburners”\r\nand “Hunkers” were tiring of defeat. Neither relished exile from office\r\nall the time. They agreed on the nomination of former Mayor Havemeyer,\r\nwho personally was popular, though the Wigwam leaders had caused his\r\nadministration to be discredited. Havemeyer was elected by the slender\r\nmajority of 928 over the Whig candidate, Mayor Brady. The Native\r\nAmerican party had now about gone out of existence.\r\n\r\nBut the factions soon disagreed again on national questions, and\r\nsent conflicting Tammany delegations to the national convention in\r\nBaltimore, in May, 1848. After tedious debate and much acrimony both\r\nwere allowed a half vote to each delegate. When, however, it was\r\nseen that the “Barnburners” voted with some other States in support\r\nof the principle against the extension of slavery to free territory,\r\na movement was started to reject them. The prospect of losing the\r\nall-important electoral vote of New York State was not pleasant to the\r\nconvention. To avoid the arbitrary rejection of either faction the\r\ncommittee on credentials suggested a compromise by which it refused\r\nto open the discussion as to which faction ought to be accepted until\r\nboth had pledged themselves to abide by the decision of the convention.\r\nKnowing that this would be pro-slavery, the “Barnburners” declared that\r\n“the Democracy of New York must be admitted unconditionally or not at\r\nall,” and withdrew. The “Hunkers” took the required pledge.\r\n\r\nArriving home, the “Barnburner” delegates issued an address saying\r\nthat a faction existed among them whose object was the perpetuation\r\nand the extension of human servitude. Bold, unscrupulous and active,\r\nit wielded to a great degree the patronage of the Federal Government.\r\nIt addressed itself to the fears of some, to the cupidity of others.\r\nBy these means it had got possession of the late national convention\r\nand had proclaimed a candidate for the Presidency--a man who obtained\r\nhis nomination only as the price of the most abject subserviency to\r\nthe slave power. The “Barnburners” then took steps to name candidates\r\nin opposition to Lewis Cass and Gen. W. O. Butler, the Baltimore\r\nnominees, who had been promptly approved by the “Hunker” element in the\r\nWigwam. Calling Martin Van Buren from obscurity, they nominated him\r\nfor President, anticipating the action of the Free Soil convention at\r\nBuffalo in August.\r\n\r\nThroughout the slavery agitation up to the firing on Fort Sumter,\r\nthe South had no firmer supporter than Tammany. In the hall Southern\r\nrepresentatives spoke and spread broadcast their doctrines on every\r\navailable occasion; however ultra those doctrines might be, the Wigwam\r\naudiences never missed applauding them enthusiastically.\r\n\r\nThe “Hunkers” immediately opened a series of Cass meetings. “All the\r\nSouth asks,” said Gen. Stevenson at one of them in Tammany Hall, on\r\nJune 9, 1848, “is non-interference.” He was cheered wildly. As usual,\r\nthe “regular” Democratic nominations were supported by the backbone\r\nof the Democracy in New York City--those who clung to the mere name\r\nand forms of the party as well as the active men who lived in office\r\nand luxuriated on the spoils. The “Barnburners,” otherwise now styled\r\nthe Free Soilers, were quite as active as the “Hunkers,” and their\r\ndefection on election day enabled Gen. Taylor to carry the city--the\r\nsupposed Democratic stronghold--by 9,883 votes.\r\n\r\nThe dissensions in the Wigwam were as pronounced in the Spring of\r\n1849--at least outwardly. The two factions held separate Mayoralty\r\nconventions on the same night. The “Barnburners” were naturally\r\neager for Havemeyer, one of themselves, but he would not have the\r\nhonor. Hearing that the “Hunkers” were proposing Myndert Van Schaick,\r\nan extremely popular man, the “Barnburners” resolved to steal the\r\n“Hunkers’” thunder by nominating him themselves. This they accordingly\r\ndid, and the bewildered public was treated to the spectacle of Van\r\nSchaick standing as the candidate of both the recriminating factions.\r\nThere were not wanting those who professed to see in this action an\r\nagreement between the leaders on the matter of the local offices. The\r\nWhigs elected Caleb S. Woodhull by 4,121 plurality, and secured over\r\ntwo-thirds of the members of the Common Council. The Democrats of the\r\n“Old School,”--the unyielding “Hunkers”--would not vote for a candidate\r\nthe Free Soilers approved of; they either did not vote at all or voted\r\nfor Woodhull.\r\n\r\nThe “Barnburners,” practically driven out of Tammany Hall by the\r\n“Hunkers,” had been meeting elsewhere. Tiring of defeats, however,\r\novertures for reunion were made during the Fall campaign. A fusion\r\nresulted, not only in the city but in other parts of the State, and\r\ncandidates were agreed upon.[3] But no sooner had the reunion been\r\ndeclared than a number of irreconcilable “Hunkers” and certain other\r\npoliticians--including Daniel E. Sickles, James T. Brady, “Mike” Walsh\r\nand John M. Bloodgood--formed a self-constituted “Democratic-Republican\r\nExecutive Committee” to oppose the deal. On the day before election\r\nthey sent out a circular denouncing the fusion, and declaring that\r\nthough it promised much it was really only a means of engrafting upon\r\nDemocratic time-honored principles a set of abolition doctrines,\r\n“hostile to the peace and welfare of the Republic and repugnant to the\r\nsympathies and intelligence of the Democratic party.”[4]\r\n\r\nThis circular was misleading. Neither the “Barnburners” nor the\r\n“Hunkers” had imposed any sacrifice of principle upon the other. They\r\nmerely agreed for the time being to suspend their differences in order\r\nto get a controlling influence over the disbursement of municipal\r\nfinances. The opinion of each voter on the slavery question was left\r\nuntouched.\r\n\r\nThe election was hotly contested, for by the new State constitution\r\nthe selection of minor State offices had been taken from the Governor\r\nand Legislature and given to the people.[5] Owing to this defection of\r\na strong Tammany group the Whigs carried the city. The excitement in\r\nthe Wigwam, when the result became known, was intense. Four thousand\r\nTammany men, looking either for office or party triumph, were in a\r\nfrenzy. W. D. Wallach, a politician of some note, mounted the rostrum,\r\nand under the stimulus of disappointment, held forth in a long and\r\nremarkable harangue, to which his auditors listened in comparative\r\nsilence, though the same utterances at another time might have provoked\r\na riot in the Wigwam. Men of downright dishonesty, Wallach said, had\r\ncrept into the organization by the aid of bullies and loafers. These\r\nmen of late years had managed to wield great power at Tammany primary\r\nelections, where, as everybody knew, matters long had been arranged\r\n“upon the assumption that by a free application of money, violence and\r\nroguery, the people could and should be controlled.” What wonder was\r\nit, he asked, that thousands of quiet and respectable Democrats had\r\nceased to bow to the authority of regular nominations, however worthy\r\nthe candidates, when they found more or less of the Tammany nominating\r\ncommittees returned in part notoriously by violence, if not by fraud?\r\n\r\nThe breach between the “Barnburners” and the extreme “Hunkers” was\r\nreopened and widened by this self-constituted committee’s action. It\r\nled to the formation of two bodies, each claiming to be the genuine\r\ngeneral committee of Tammany Hall. One was led by Fernando Wood, who\r\nwas suspected of being a “Hunker,” but was too much of a politician\r\nto be active against the “Barnburners.” This general committee was of\r\na compromising disposition. In brief, it was composed mainly of what\r\nwere known as political “trimmers”--men willing to make any sacrifices\r\nof principle for individual or party success. The other committee, of\r\nwhich Henry M. Western was the head, was composed of “Hunkers” and took\r\nup the interests of the self-formed “Democratic-Republican Executive\r\nCommittee.” It was the first body in the North to call a meeting to\r\ndenounce the Wilmot proviso. To all intents standing for principle,\r\neach committee sought the tremendous advantages of the possession of\r\nTammany Hall and its political machinery. By being recognized as the\r\n“regular” general committee, its nominations would be “regular” and as\r\nsuch would command the votes of the great mass of Democrats. To obtain\r\nthat recognition both committees realized the necessity of obtaining a\r\nmajority of the Council of Sachems, which, in critical moments, had so\r\nthoroughly demonstrated its legal right to eject from the Wigwam any\r\nman or body of men it pleased.\r\n\r\nThe opening struggle between the factions for mastery took place at\r\nthe annual election of the society on April 15, 1850. Each body made\r\ndesperate efforts to elect its list of Sachems. The ticket in favor of\r\na union of the factions and of reorganizing the “Wood committee” was\r\nheaded by Elijah F. Purdy, then Grand Sachem, and contained the names\r\nof Isaac V. Fowler, John A. Bogert, John J. Manning and others. Former\r\nMayor Mickle, Charles O’Conor, Francis B. Cutting and M. M. Noah led\r\nthe rival ticket.\r\n\r\nThe “Hunkers” brought to the polls many men, who, though still members\r\nof the society, long since had gone over to the Whigs and had lost the\r\nhabit of attending the society’s meetings. These men claimed the right\r\nto vote, and it was unquestionably theirs. In law the Tammany Society\r\nwas merely a charitable and benevolent corporation. No member in good\r\nstanding could be debarred from voting. With cheerful alacrity these\r\nWhig members lent their aid in distracting the Democratic party into\r\nkeeping up a double organization. Office-holders and other men openly\r\nattached to the Whig party voted.[6] When it seemed that most of the\r\nPurdy ticket was elected, the two “Hunker” inspectors suddenly found\r\nthree more “Hunker” tickets in the ballot box. Previously this box had\r\nbeen examined, emptied and exposed publicly. These three ballots, if\r\ncounted, would have elected one more Sachem of the “Hunker” stripe,\r\ngiving that faction six of the thirteen Sachems--one short of a\r\nmajority. The two “Barnburner” inspectors refused to count them. The\r\nresult of the election being disputed, Purdy promptly took possession\r\nof the books and papers of the society.\r\n\r\nAs the best solution of the troubles, the Sachems, on April 26,\r\ndetermined to forbid both committees admittance to the Wigwam. The\r\nSachems did not acknowledge accountability to any one for their\r\nactions, not even to the society which elected them.[7] Representing\r\nthemselves as the supreme judges of which was the real Democratic\r\nGeneral Committee or whether there was any,[8] the Sachems let it be\r\nunderstood that they would act as mediators. By a vote of 10 to 1,[9]\r\nthey “recommended”--an action equivalent to an arbitrary order--that\r\nthe “Wood committee” provide for the election of delegates to a\r\nconvention in Tammany Hall “to reorganize the New York City Democracy.”\r\nFrom the substance of the invitation sent out by the society to various\r\nconspicuous personages it was evident that, though the “Wood committee”\r\nhad been favored, somehow a majority of the “Hunker,” or pro-slavery\r\nSachems was installed.[10]\r\n\r\nThe plan of a convention was accepted by both factions. But by\r\nmanipulating the primary elections for delegates Fernando Wood\r\nsucceeded in filling the convention with his own creatures, allowing,\r\nfor form’s sake, a sprinkling of opponents. Wood, whose aim was to get\r\nthe nomination for Mayor, was the chief “trimmer,” though each side\r\nmade concessions. Various equivocal resolutions touching the slavery\r\nquestion were adopted, and a new Tammany General Committee, comprising\r\n“Barnburners,” mild “Hunkers” and ultra-“Hunkers,” was formed.\r\n\r\nThe “Barnburners” and “Hunkers” then agreed upon a coalition in\r\nState and city, uniting on Horatio Seymour for Governor. Despite\r\nthe diplomacy of Wood, who had arranged this pact, an explosion was\r\nnarrowly averted a few weeks later. Finding themselves in a majority at\r\na slimly attended meeting of the general committee in the latter part\r\nof September, 1850, the uncompromising “Hunkers” denounced parleying\r\nwith Free Soilers, and by a vote of 16 to 11 refused to sustain\r\nSeymour. As soon as their action became known there was a burst of\r\nindignation. The threat was made that if the committee did not rescind\r\nit, the Council of Sachems, most of whom, it seems, Wood had won over\r\nto his plans, would turn it out of Tammany Hall. The members of the\r\ncommittee hastened to meet, the ultra-“Hunkers” were routed, and the\r\nState candidates strongly indorsed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] The Century Dictionary derives the word from the Dutch _honk_,\r\npost, goal or home. The transition in meaning from “goal” to “office”\r\nis easy and natural.\r\n\r\n[2] Shepard became Grand Sachem at an early age. He was one of the very\r\nfew influential men achieving prominence in the society or organization\r\nagainst whose character, public or private, no charges were ever\r\nbrought.\r\n\r\n[3] New York _Weekly Herald_, November 3, 1849. James Gordon Bennett,\r\neditor and owner of this newspaper, “was a recognized member of the\r\nTammany party.” (“Memoirs of James Gordon Bennett and His Times,”\r\n1855, p. 80.) When Bennett first contemplated starting a newspaper, it\r\nwas to the Young Men’s General Committee that he applied for funds.\r\nThough professing to be independent, the Herald nearly always supported\r\nTammany Hall. In 1837-39, however, it had supported Aaron Clark.\r\n\r\n[4] The committee advertised the stand it had taken in the Democratic\r\njournals of the city on November 5.\r\n\r\n[5] The city charter of 1846 had likewise increased the number of\r\nelective offices in the municipality.\r\n\r\n[6] New York _Evening Post_ (Democratic), April 16, 1850.\r\n\r\n[7] New York _Weekly Herald_, May 4, 1850.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[9] _Evening Post_, May 2, 1850.\r\n\r\n[10] Seven Sachems signed the letter of invitation, which read in\r\npart: “Brothers of this society look with deep concern at the present\r\ncritical state of the country and are not unmindful of the services\r\nof those who are laboring to thwart the designs of the fanatics\r\nand demagogues who are waging an unholy crusade against a union of\r\nindependent sovereignties, which union has done much to advance\r\nand perpetuate the principles of American liberty throughout the\r\nworld.… We have no sympathy with those who war upon the South and its\r\ninstitutions.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nDEFEAT AND VICTORY\r\n\r\n1850-1852\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder a new charter the Mayor’s term was extended to two years, and the\r\ntime of election, with that of the other city officers, was changed to\r\nNovember. The latter change gave great satisfaction to the leaders, for\r\nit enabled them to trade votes. Trading grew to such an extent that\r\ncharges became common of this or that nominee for President, Governor,\r\nState Senator and so on being “sold out” by the leaders to insure their\r\nown election.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany organization, too, had made a change. It had adopted\r\nthe convention system of nominating. This new method was much more\r\nsatisfactory to the leaders, because the election of delegates to\r\nthe conventions could easily be controlled, and the risk of having\r\nprearranged nominations overruled by an influx of “gangs” into the\r\ngreat popular meeting was eliminated.\r\n\r\nA show of opposition to the proposed program was, however, still\r\nnecessary. The first general convention was held in October, 1850.\r\nFernando Wood was the leading candidate for Mayor, and it was certain\r\nthat he would be nominated. But the first ballot showed a half-dozen\r\ncompetitors. The second ballot, however, disclosed the real situation,\r\nand Wood was chosen by 29 votes, to 22 for John J. Cisco.\r\n\r\nWood was a remarkable man. As a tactician and organizer he was the\r\nsuperior both of his distant predecessor Burr and of his successors\r\nTweed and Sweeny. He was born in Philadelphia, in June, 1812, of Quaker\r\nparents. At the age of thirteen, he was earning $2 a week as a clerk.\r\nLater, he became a cigarmaker and tobacco dealer, and still later, a\r\ngrocer. As a lad he was pugnacious; in a Harrisburg bar-room he once\r\nfloored with a chair a State Senator who had attacked him. But he\r\nseems to have been amenable to good advice; for once when a Quaker\r\nreprimanded him for his excessive use of tobacco with the observation,\r\n“Friend, thee smokes a good deal,” he at once threw away his cigar, and\r\ngave up the habit.\r\n\r\nComing to New York, he engaged in several business enterprises, all\r\nthe while taking a considerable interest in politics. He was elected\r\nto Congress in 1840, serving one term. Gradually he came to make\r\npolitics his vocation. Political manipulation before his day was, at\r\nthe best, clumsy and crude. Under his facile genius and painstaking\r\ncare, it developed to the rank of an exact science. He devoted himself\r\nfor years to ingratiating himself with the factors needed in carrying\r\nelections.[1] He curried favor with the petty criminals of the Five\r\nPoints, the boisterous roughs of the river edge, and the swarms of\r\nimmigrants, as well as with the peaceable and industrious mechanics and\r\nlaborers; and he won a following even among the business men. All these\r\nhe marshaled systematically in the Tammany organization. Politics was\r\nhis science, and the “fixing” of primaries his specialty; in this he\r\nwas perhaps without a peer.\r\n\r\nHis unscrupulousness was not confined to politics. During this brief\r\ncampaign he was repeatedly charged with commercial frauds as well\r\nas with bribery and dishonest practises at the primaries. A year\r\nlater he was shown to have been guilty before this time of having\r\ndefrauded a partner of $8,000, and he escaped conviction by the merest\r\ntechnicality.[2]\r\n\r\nPolitical standards in the fifties were not high. But the rowdy\r\ncharacter of a great part of Tammany’s membership, and the personal\r\ncharacter of many of its nominees, particularly that of Wood, proved\r\ntoo much to bear, even for those days, and a strong revulsion followed.\r\nFormer Mayors Havemeyer and Mickle; John McKeon, a leader of note, and\r\nother prominent Democrats revolted. The election resulted in a Whig\r\nvictory, Ambrose C. Kingsland securing 22,546 votes to 17,973 for Wood.\r\nA great Democratic defection was shown by the fact that Horatio Seymour\r\ncarried the city by only 705 plurality.\r\n\r\nSo general were the expressions of contempt for the character of\r\nthe Wigwam that the Sachems resolved to invoke again the spirit of\r\npatriotism, and consequently fixed upon a revival of the old custom of\r\nIndependence Day celebrations. In 1851 the ruling Council of Sachems\r\nwas a mixture of compromise “Barnburners” and “Hunkers.” The committee\r\nof arrangements--Elijah F. Purdy, Daniel E. Delavan, Richard B.\r\nConnolly, Stephen C. Duryea and three others--sent invitations, filled\r\nwith lofty and patriotic sentiments, to various national politicians.\r\n“Barnburners” also were invited, the conciliatory Sachems being\r\nsincerely tired of a warfare which threatened to exile them all from\r\nthe sinecures of city and State offices.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Tammany, or Columbian Order, the circular said, had\r\noriginated “in a fraternity of patriots, solemnly consecrated to\r\nthe independence, the popular liberty and the federal union of the\r\ncountry.” Tammany’s councils were “ever vigilant for the preservation\r\nof those great national treasures from the grasp alike of the\r\ntreacherous and the open spoiler.” It had “enrolled in its brotherhood\r\nmany of the most illustrious statesmen, patriots and heroes that had\r\nconstellated the historic banners of the past and present age.… And it\r\nremained to the present hour,” the glowing lines read on, “instinct\r\nwith its primitive spirit and true to the same sacred trust.”\r\n\r\nThe rhetoric delivered at the celebration was quite as pretentious and\r\nhigh-flown. But the phrases made no impression on the public mind. No\r\nimpartial observer denied that the Wigwam’s moral prestige with the\r\nState and national party was for the time gone. Throughout the country\r\nthe belief prevailed that the politicians of the metropolis deserved\r\nno respect, merit or consideration; and that they were purchasable and\r\ntransferable like any stock in Wall street.\r\n\r\nIf before 1846 nominations were sold it was not an open transaction.\r\nSince then the practise of selling them had gradually grown, and now\r\nthe bargaining was unconcealed. Upon the highest bidder the honors\r\ngenerally fell. Whigs and Tammany men were alike guilty. If one\r\naspirant offered $1,000, another offered $2,000. But these sums were\r\nmerely a beginning; committees would impress upon the candidate the\r\nfact that a campaign costs money; more of the “boys” would have to\r\nbe “seen”; such and such a “ward heeler” needed “pacifying”; a band\r\nwas a proper embellishment, with a parade to boot, and voters needed\r\n“persuading.” And at the last moment a dummy candidate would be brought\r\nforward as a man who had offered much more for the nomination. Then the\r\nbidder at $2,000 would have to pay the difference, and if the office\r\nsought was a profitable one, the candidate would be a lucky man if\r\nhe did not have to disgorge as much as $15,000 before securing the\r\nnomination. Some candidates were bled for as much as $20,000, and even\r\nthis was a moderate sum compared to the prices which obtained a few\r\nyears later.\r\n\r\nThe primaries were attended by “gangs” more rowdy and corrupt than\r\never; Whig ward committees often sold over to Tammany,[3] and Whig\r\nvotes, bought or traded, swelled the ballot boxes at the Wigwam\r\nprimaries. Nearly every saloon was the headquarters of a “gang” whose\r\nenergies and votes could be bought. In Tammany Hall an independent\r\nDemocrat dared not speak unless he had previously made terms with the\r\ncontrolling factions, according to a relatively fixed tariff of rates.\r\nThe primaries of both parties had become so scandalously corrupt as to\r\ncommand no respect.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of gold in California and Australia created in all\r\nclasses a feverish desire for wealth. Vessel after vessel was arriving\r\nin the harbor with millions of dollars’ worth of gold dust. Newspapers\r\nand magazines were filled with glowing accounts of how poor men became\r\nrich in a dazzlingly short period. The desire for wealth became a\r\nmania, and seized upon all callings. The effect was a still further\r\nlowering of the public tone; standards were generally lost sight of,\r\nand all means of “getting ahead” came to be considered legitimate.\r\nPoliticians, trafficking in nominations and political influence, found\r\nit a most auspicious time.\r\n\r\nThis condition was intensified by the influx of the hordes of\r\nimmigrants driven by famine and oppression from Ireland, Germany and\r\nother European countries. From over 129,000 arriving at the port of\r\nNew York in 1847, the number increased to 189,000 in 1848, 220,000\r\nin 1849, 212,000 in 1850, 289,000 in 1851 and 300,000 in 1852. Some\r\nof these sought homes in other States, but a large portion remained\r\nin the city. Though many of these were thrifty and honest, numbers\r\nwere ignorant and vicious, and the pauper and criminal classes of\r\nthe metropolis grew larger than ever. The sharper-witted among them\r\nsoon mended their poverty by making a livelihood of politics. To them\r\npolitical rights meant the obtaining of money or the receiving of\r\njobs under the city, State or national government, in return for the\r\nmarshaling of voters at the polls. Regarding issues they bothered\r\nlittle, and knew less.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the Whig and Native American denunciation of the alien\r\nvote were now seen. The naturalized citizens almost invariably sided\r\nwith Tammany Hall, although there were times when, by outbidding the\r\nWigwam, the Whigs were enabled to use them in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nDespite an unusual degree of public condemnation, Tammany managed, by\r\na temporary pacification of the factions and a general use of illegal\r\nvotes, to carry the city in the Fall of 1851 by nearly 2,000 majority.\r\nBut it could not hold the regular Democratic strength, for Wright,\r\nthe candidate for Governor, received over 3,000 majority. Frauds were\r\nnotorious. In one of the polling places of the Nineteenth Ward, the\r\nWigwam’s candidates for Alderman and Assistant Alderman were counted in\r\nafter a mob invaded it and forced the Whig inspectors to flee for their\r\nlives. When the votes for the Assembly ticket were counted 532 were\r\nannounced, although there were only 503 names on the poll list. This\r\nwas but an instance of the widespread repeating and violence.\r\n\r\nWith its large majority in the Common Council Tammany at first made\r\na feint at curtailing city expenses. The taxpayers complained that\r\nthe taxes were upwards of $3,500,000, for which there was little\r\napparent benefit. The new Common Council made professions of giving a\r\nspotless administration; but before its term was over it had generally\r\nearned the expressive title of “the Forty Thieves.”[4] This was the\r\nbody that with lavish promises of reform replaced the Whig Common\r\nCouncil. William M. Tweed, an Alderman in the “Forty Thieves” Common\r\nCouncil, was busy in the Fall of this year indignantly defending, in\r\nspeeches and public writings, the Aldermen from the numerous charges\r\nof corruption; but, as will be seen, these charges were by no means\r\ngroundless.\r\n\r\nSince the passings of the Equal Rights party, the mechanics and\r\nlaborers had taken no concerted part in politics, not even as a\r\nfaction. But at this period they were far from being lethargic. The\r\nrecent discoveries of gold and silver had given a quickened pulse to\r\nbusiness, enormously increasing the number of transactions and the\r\naggregate of profits. The workers were determined to have their share\r\nof this prosperity, and acted accordingly. Old trade-unions were\r\nrapidly strengthened and new ones formed. More pay and shorter hours of\r\nwork were demanded. Between the Spring of 1850 and the Spring of 1853\r\nnearly every trade in the city engaged in one or more strikes, with\r\nalmost invariable success.\r\n\r\nHaving now no sincere leaders to prompt them to concerted political\r\naction, the workers oscillated listlessly between the two parties.\r\nThey had lost the tremendous influence secured in the thirties,\r\nand the business element had again become dominant. Legislature\r\nand Common Council vied with each other in granting exploitative\r\ncharters, and the persons who secured these, generally by bribery,\r\nwere considered the leaders of public opinion. Every company demanding\r\nspecial privileges of the State maintained its lobby at Albany. The\r\nCity Council was more easily reached, and was generally dealt with\r\npersonally. Fortunes were made by plundering the city and State, and\r\nwhile the conduct of the agents and actual performers in this wholesale\r\nbrigandage--the lobbyists, Legislators and Aldermen--was looked upon\r\nsomewhat doubtfully, their employers stood before the world as the\r\nrepresentatives of virtue and respectability. The one force which might\r\nhave stood as a bulwark against this system of pillage had been so\r\ncompletely demoralized by its political experiences that it could now\r\nonly look on and let matters drift as they would.\r\n\r\nIn the Baltimore Democratic convention the Wigwam was represented by so\r\nboisterous a delegation that its speakers were denied a hearing. Among\r\nthe delegates were Capt. Rynders, “Mike” Walsh and a number of the same\r\nkind. Cass was their favorite, and they shouted for him lustily; but on\r\nattempting to speak for him they were invariably howled down, despite\r\nthe fact that Cass had a majority of the convention almost to the end\r\nof the balloting.\r\n\r\nThe Wigwam, however, lost no time in indorsing the nomination of\r\nFranklin Pierce. In this ratification the “Barnburners” joined,\r\nardently urging the election of candidates on a platform which held\r\nthat Congress had no power under the Constitution “to interfere with\r\nthe domestic institutions of the States”; which advocated compromise\r\nmeasures, the execution of the Fugitive Slave law, and which opposed\r\nall attempts to agitate the slavery question.\r\n\r\nThe election of November, 1852, was not only for President and\r\nCongressmen, but for a long list of officials, city and State. Each of\r\nthe Wigwam factions began playing for advantage. On July 16 a portion\r\nof the general committee met, apparently to accept an invitation to\r\nattend the funeral of Henry Clay. The “Barnburners,” finding themselves\r\nin a majority, sprang a trick upon the “Hunkers” by adopting a plan\r\nof primary elections favorable to their side. Later the general\r\ncommittee, in full meeting, substituted another plan, and a great\r\nhubbub followed. A “committee of conciliation,” composed of members of\r\nboth factions, was appointed. When it met, on August 20, the halls,\r\nlobbies and entrances of Tammany Hall were filled with a vicious\r\nassortment of persons, chiefly inimical to the general committee. “The\r\nbar-room,” wrote a chronicler, “was the scene of several encounters\r\nand knockdowns. It was only necessary for a man to express himself\r\nstrongly on any point, when down he went, by the hammer-fist of one of\r\nthe fighting men.” Even members of the committee, while passing in and\r\nout of the room, were intimidated. Daniel E. Sickles was threatened\r\nwith personal violence, and it might have gone hard with him had he\r\nnot taken the precaution of arming himself with a bowie and revolver.\r\nMembers’ lives were constantly threatened; the scenes of uproar and\r\nconfusion were indescribable. Mr. Sickles, for his own safety, had to\r\njump from a window to Frankfort street, and other members were forced\r\nto retreat through secret byways.[5] It was near day-break when the\r\nfactions consented to leave the Wigwam.\r\n\r\nThe anxiety of each was explained by the proceedings at the primaries.\r\nThe faction having a majority of the inspectors secured by far the\r\ngreater number of votes, and consequently the delegates who had the\r\npower of making nominations. At the primaries of August, 1852, fraud\r\nand violence occurred at nearly every voting place. In some instances\r\none faction took possession of the polls and prevented the other from\r\nvoting; in others, both factions had control by turns, and fighting\r\nwas desperate. One party ran away with a ballot box and carried it off\r\nto the police station. Many ballot boxes, it was alleged, were half\r\nfilled with votes before the election was opened. Wards containing less\r\nthan 1,000 legal Democratic voters yielded 2,000 votes, and a ticket\r\nwhich not a hundred voters of the ward had seen was elected by 600 or\r\n700 majority. Whigs, boys and paupers voted; the purchasable, who\r\nflocked to either party according to the price, came out in force, and\r\nruffianism dominated the whole.\r\n\r\nThe police dared not interfere. Their appointment was made by the\r\nAldermen and Assistant Aldermen, with the nominal consent of the Mayor,\r\nexclusively on political grounds and for one year. The policeman’s\r\nlivelihood depended upon the whims of those most concerned in the ward\r\nturmoils. A hard lot was the policeman’s. On the one hand, public\r\nopinion demanded that he arrest offenders. On the other, most of the\r\nAldermen had their “gangs” of lawbreakers at the polls, and to arrest\r\none of these might mean his dismissal.[6] But this was not all. The\r\npolitics of the Common Council changed frequently; and to insure\r\nhimself his position the guardian of the peace must conduct himself\r\naccording to the difficult mean of aiding his own party to victory and\r\nyet of giving no offense to the politicians of the other party. Hence,\r\nwhenever a political disturbance took place the policeman instantly, it\r\nwas a saying, became “deaf and blind, and generally invisible.”[7]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of uniting to displace the Whigs from the millions of\r\ncity patronage and profit brought the factions to an understanding.\r\nJacob A. Westervelt, a moderate “Hunker,” and a shipbuilder of wealth,\r\nwho was considered the very essence of “respectability,” and a\r\ncontrast to Wood, was nominated for Mayor. Tammany planned to have its\r\ncandidates swept in on the Presidential current. National issues were\r\nmade dominant, and the city responded by giving the Pierce electors\r\n11,159 plurality, and electing the whole organization ticket.[8] Fraud\r\nwas common. No registry law was in force to hinder men from voting, as\r\nit was charged some did, as often as twenty times. On the other hand,\r\n80,000 tickets purporting to be Democratic, intended for distribution\r\nby the Whigs, but not containing the name of a single Democrat, were\r\nseized at the post-office and carried in triumph to the Wigwam.\r\n\r\nTammany once more had full control of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Wood’s was an attractive personality. He was a handsome man, six\r\nfeet high, slender and straight, with keen blue eyes, and regular\r\nfeatures. His manner was kindly and engaging.\r\n\r\n[2] Wood was charged with having obtained about $8,000 on false\r\nrepresentations from his partner, Edward E. Marvine, in a transaction.\r\nMarvine brought suit against Wood in the Superior Court, and three\r\nreferees gave a unanimous decision in the plaintiff’s favor. The Grand\r\nJury, on November 7, 1851, indicted Wood for obtaining money under\r\nfalse pretenses, but he pleaded the Statute of Limitations. A friendly\r\nRecorder decided that as his offense had been committed three years\r\npreviously (on November 7, 1848), the period required by the statute\r\nhad been fully covered. The indictment, therefore, was quashed, and\r\nWood escaped by _one_ day.\r\n\r\n[3] New York _Tribune_, May 5, 1852. (This admission on the part of a\r\nWhig journal caused a great stir.)\r\n\r\n[4] There was another “Forty Thieves” Council five or six years later,\r\nwhich must not be confounded with the earlier and more notorious one.\r\n\r\n[5] The _Herald_, which, as usual, supported Tammany this year,\r\ndescribed (August 24, 1852) these violences in detail.\r\n\r\n[6] The political lawbreaker had a final immunity from punishment in\r\nthe fact that Aldermen sat as Justices in the Mayor’s Court, which\r\ntried such culprits, if ever they happened to be arrested.\r\n\r\n[7] See Report of Chief of Police Matsell, _Documents of the Board of\r\nAldermen_, Vol. XXX, part 1, No. 17. The extreme turbulence of the city\r\nat this time may be judged from the fact that, despite the comparative\r\nimmunity of political lawbreakers, during the eight years 1846-54,\r\n200,083 arrests were made, an average of 25,010 a year.\r\n\r\n[8] The vote on Mayor stood: Westervelt, 33,251; Morgan Morgans,\r\n23,719; Henry M. Western, 861; blank and scattering, 227; total,\r\n58,058.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n“HARDSHELLS” AND “SOFTSHELLS”\r\n\r\n1852-1853\r\n\r\n\r\nThe “Barnburner”-“Hunker” factional fight was succeeded by that of the\r\n“Hardshells” and “Softshells.” How the ludicrous nicknames originated\r\nit is not possible to say. The “Softshells” were composed of a remnant\r\nof the “Barnburners”[1] and that part of the “Hunkers” who believed in\r\na full union with the “Barnburners,” especially in the highly important\r\nmatter of distributing offices. The “Hardshells” were the “Old Hunkers”\r\nwho disavowed all connection with the “Barnburners,” or Free Soilers,\r\nexcept so far as to get their votes. This division also extended to\r\nother parts of the State, where perhaps real differences of political\r\nprinciple were responsible for it; but in the city the fundamental\r\npoint of contention was the booty of office.\r\n\r\nThe “Hardshells” boasted in 1852 of a majority of the Tammany General\r\nCommittee which met on December 2 to choose inspectors for the ward\r\nelections of delegates to the general committee for 1853. The control\r\nof these inspectors was the keynote of the situation, for they would\r\nreturn such delegates as they pleased. Angered at the appointment of\r\n“Hardshell” inspectors, the “Softshells” broke in the door of the\r\ncommittee room, assaulted the members of the committee with chairs,\r\nfractured some heads and forced the “Hards” to flee for refuge to the\r\nAstor House.[2]\r\n\r\nAgreeable to “usages,” the departing general committee instructed the\r\ndelegates of its successor to assemble in Tammany Hall on January 13,\r\n1853, to be installed as the general committee for the ensuing year.\r\nUntil this installation, the committee of the last year remained\r\nin power. In the interval the Sachems, who, in the peculiar mix of\r\npolitics, were for the most part “Softshells,” decided to take a hand\r\nin the game of getting control of the organization, and therefore\r\ncalled a meeting for the same night and at the same time.\r\n\r\nThe object of the old general committee was to allow only delegates\r\nwhose seats were uncontested to vote on the organization, or the\r\ncontest of seats, which would return a “Hardshell” committee. The\r\nSachems, on the contrary, favored voting by those who had the\r\nindorsement of two of the three inspectors.\r\n\r\nThe “Hardshells” insisted that the Sachems had unwarrantably\r\ninterfered; that this was the first time in the history of the society\r\nof any interference as to the manner of organizing the general\r\ncommittee; that the only power the Sachems had was to decide between\r\ncontending parties for the use of the hall for political meetings, and\r\nthat even then their power was doubtful.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Sachem ordered the doors of the meeting room locked till 7:30\r\no’clock, at which hour both factions streamed in. Soon there were two\r\nmeetings in the same room, each with a chairman, and each vociferously\r\ntrying to shout down the other. Neither accomplished anything, and\r\nboth adjourned, and kept adjourning from day to day, awaiting positive\r\naction by the society.\r\n\r\nThe “Softshell” section of the general committee called a meeting\r\nfor January 20, but it was prohibited by the Sachems. When doubt\r\nof their authority was expressed, the Sachems produced a lease\r\nexecuted in 1842 to Howard, the lessee of the property, by the Tammany\r\nSociety, in which he agreed that he would not lease, either directly\r\nor indirectly, the hall, or any part of the building, to any other\r\npolitical party (or parties) whatever, calling themselves committees,\r\nwhose general political principles did not appear to him or the Sachems\r\nto be in accordance with the general political principles of the\r\nDemocratic-Republican General Committee of New York City, of which\r\nElijah F. Purdy was then chairman. Howard had also agreed that\r\n\r\n    “if there should be at any time a doubt arising in his mind\r\n    or that of his assigns, or in the mind of the Grand Sachem\r\n    of the Tammany Society for the time being, in ascertaining\r\n    the political character of any political party that should be\r\n    desirous of obtaining admission to Tammany Hall for the purpose\r\n    of holding a political meeting, then either might give notice\r\n    in writing to the Father of the Council of the Tammany Society,\r\n    in which event it was the duty of the Father of the Council to\r\n    assemble the Grand Council, who would determine in the matter\r\n    and whose decision should be final, conclusive and binding.”\r\n\r\nOf the thirteen Sachems, eleven were “Softshells”--a predominance due\r\nto the activity of the “Barnburners.” The “Hardshells,” without doubt,\r\nwere in a majority in the Tammany Society and in Tammany Hall, but\r\nthey had taken no such pains as had their opponents to elect their\r\nmen. The Sachems’ meeting on January 20, professedly to decide the\r\nmerits of the contest, called for the ward representatives in turn. The\r\n“Hardshells” refused to answer or to acknowledge the Sachems’ authority\r\nto interfere with the primary elections of the people. The Sachems then\r\nnamed by resolution the general committee they favored, thus deciding\r\nin favor of the “Softshell” committee. There was no little suppressed\r\nexcitement, since the members of the Tammany Society, it was naïvely\r\ntold, though allowed to be present, were not allowed to speak.\r\n\r\nAlderman Thomas J. Barr, a member of the Tammany Society and chairman\r\nof the “Hardshell” committee, handed to the Sachems, on behalf of his\r\nassociates, an energetic protest. Summarized, it read as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Tammany Society is a private association, incorporated\r\n    for charitable purposes. There is nothing in its charter,\r\n    constitution or by-laws making it a political organization in\r\n    any sense of the term. The Democrats of New York City have\r\n    never, in any manner or by any act, vested in the society the\r\n    right to prescribe the rules for their government in matters of\r\n    political organization.\r\n\r\n    “The society comprises among its members men belonging to all\r\n    the different political parties of the day. The only political\r\n    test of admission to membership is to be ‘a Republican in favor\r\n    of the Constitution of the United States.’ It is, besides, a\r\n    secret society, whose transactions are known only to its own\r\n    officers and members, except so far as might be the pleasure\r\n    of the Council to make the proceedings public. It can never be\r\n    tolerated that a body which, in the language of its charter,\r\n    was created ‘to carry into effect the benevolent purpose of\r\n    affording relief to the indigent and distressed,’ and which is\r\n    wholly independent of the great body of the Democracy shall be\r\n    permitted to sit in judgment upon the primary organization of\r\n    the Democratic-Republican party of the city of New York; and\r\n    such a state of things, if its absurdity be not too great for\r\n    serious consideration, would amount to a despotism of the most\r\n    repugnant character and render the Democratic party of the city\r\n    an object of contempt and ridicule everywhere.… Tammany Society\r\n    owns a portion of the premises known as Tammany Hall, which is\r\n    let to Mr. Howard and forms the plant of his hotel. This fact\r\n    is all that gives to the Tammany Society any, even the least\r\n    political significance.\r\n\r\n    “The general committee derives its powers from the people, who\r\n    alone can take them away. The committee in its objects, its\r\n    organization and its responsibilities to a popular constituency\r\n    is wholly distinct from and independent of the Tammany Society,\r\n    its council or its officers, and to be efficient for any good\r\n    purpose must always so remain, leaving to the Tammany Society\r\n    its legitimate duty of excluding from Tammany Hall those who\r\n    are hostile to the Democracy and its principles.”[3]\r\n\r\nIn the bar-room many leaders of the excluded faction were assembled,\r\nsurrounded by their fighting men. When the Sachems’ adverse decision\r\nwas announced, their anger found vent in a sputter of oaths and\r\nthreats, and the sum of $15,000 was subscribed on the spot for the\r\nbuilding of a rival Tammany Hall. It is almost needless to say that\r\nthe rival hall was never built.\r\n\r\nThe Sachems later replied to the protest with the defense that their\r\nlease to Howard obliged them to act as they did. By that lease the\r\nsuccession of Elijah F. Purdy’s committee alone was at liberty to meet\r\nas a general committee in Tammany Hall; they (the Sachems) had not\r\nrecognized Barr’s committee as such, and moreover did not admit the\r\nclaim the “Hardshell” committee made of _their_ right to hire a room\r\nseparate from the majority in a building in which they had no property\r\nwhatever. The Council of Sachems insisted that it had exercised the\r\nright of excluding so-called general committees before; that Tammany\r\nwas a benevolent society, and that benevolent societies had the same\r\nright as others to determine who should occupy their property.\r\n\r\nThe “Hardshells” attempted to rout the “Softshells” at the regular\r\nmeeting of the Tammany Society on February 12, but the Sachems’ action\r\nwas confirmed by a vote of two hundred to less than a dozen. Each\r\nfaction then strained to elect a majority of the Sachems at the annual\r\nelection on April 18. Private circulars were distributed, that of the\r\n“Softshells” being signed by Isaac V. Fowler, Fernando Wood, Nelson\r\nJ. Waterbury, John Cochrane and others. It breathed allegiance to the\r\nnational and State administrations, the regular organization and to\r\nthe Baltimore platform. The “Hardshell” circular had the signatures of\r\nRichard B. Connolly, Cornelius Bogardus, Jacob Brush and others styling\r\nthemselves the “Old Line Democrats.”\r\n\r\nThe “Softshells” elected their ticket, and Isaac V. Fowler, afterward\r\npostmaster, was chosen Grand Sachem. This vote of a few score of\r\nprivate individuals decided the control of Tammany Hall and the lot of\r\nthose who would share in the division of plunder for the next year.\r\n\r\n“With the exception of some few quarrels,” one friendly account had\r\nit, “which fortunately did not result in any personal damage to\r\nthe disputants, the affair passed off very quietly. While the votes\r\nwere counted upstairs some interesting scenes were presented in the\r\nbar-room, which was crowded with anxious expectants. Language of a\r\nrather exceptional character, such as ‘political thieves,’ ‘swindlers,’\r\netc., was employed unsparingly, but as the majority was peaceably\r\ninclined, there were no heads fractured.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Many of the “Barnburners” had finally broken with the Democratic\r\nparty, and were now acting independently as Free Soilers. Afterward, in\r\ngreat part, these independents gravitated to the new Republican party.\r\n\r\n[2] This affair was exploited in the General Courts later. Seven\r\nrioters were arrested.\r\n\r\n[3] The statements of both sides were published officially in the New\r\nYork _Herald_, February 10, 1853, the bare facts covering more than an\r\nentire page of solid print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER OF DISCLOSURES\r\n\r\n1853-1854\r\n\r\n\r\nNow came an appalling series of disclosures regarding public officials.\r\nActing on the affidavit of James E. Coulter, a lobbyist, charging that\r\nthere was a private organization[1] in the Board of Aldermen formed to\r\nreceive and distribute bribes, the Grand Jury, after investigation,\r\nhanded down a presentment, on February 26, 1853, together with a vast\r\nmass of testimony.\r\n\r\n“It was clearly shown,” stated the presentment, “that enormous sums of\r\nmoney have been expended for and towards the procurement of railroad\r\ngrants in the city, and that towards the decision and procurement of\r\nthe Eighth Avenue Railroad grant a sum so large that would startle\r\nthe most credulous was expended; but in consequence of the voluntary\r\nabsence of important witnesses, the Grand Jury was left without direct\r\ntestimony of the particular recipients of the different amounts.”[2]\r\n\r\nSolomon Kipp, one of the grantees of the Eighth and Ninth Avenue\r\nRailroad franchises, admitted frequently to a member of the Grand Jury\r\nthat he had expended, in 1851, upwards of $50,000 in getting them. Five\r\ngrantees of the Third Avenue Railroad franchise swore that upwards of\r\n$30,000 was paid for it in 1852 in bribes to both boards.[3] Of this\r\nsum Alderman Tweed received $3,000. Chief among those who bribed the\r\nAldermen were Elijah F. Purdy (one of the line of Grand Sachems) and\r\nMyndert Van Schaick, who only a few years before had been the Tammany\r\ncandidate for Mayor. A franchise for a surface railroad on Broadway,\r\nwith scarcely any provision for compensation and with permission to\r\ncharge a five-cent fare, was given to Jacob Sharp, over five profitable\r\nbids from responsible persons. One applicant, Thomas E. Davies, had\r\noffered to give the city one cent for every fare charged. In another\r\napplication, Davies, D. H. Haight and others had offered $100,000\r\na year and the payment of a license fee of $1,000 on each car (the\r\nprevailing fee being $20) for a ten-years’ grant, on the agreement\r\nto charge a five-cent fare. There were two other offers equally\r\nfavorable.[4] When Mayor Kingsland had vetoed the bill[5] the Aldermen\r\nhad repassed it, notwithstanding an injunction forbidding them to do\r\nso.[6]\r\n\r\nDr. William Cockroft had to pay, among other sums, $500 to Assistant\r\nAlderman Wesley Smith to get favorable action on his application for a\r\nlease of the Catherine Street Ferry. After the passage of the grant,\r\nSmith demanded $3,000 more, which Cockroft refused to pay.[7] Burtis\r\nSkidmore, a coal dealer, testified that in the Fall of 1851 James B.\r\nTaylor informed him that he had been an applicant for a ferry across\r\nthe East River to Greenpoint, and that “he bribed members of the\r\nCommon Council for the purpose of obtaining said grant, and that other\r\napplicants for the same ferry gave a larger bribe than he did, and\r\nobtained the grant, and that all members of the Common Council whom\r\nhe had bribed returned to him the money he had paid them, with the\r\nexception of Alderman Wood, who kept the money from both parties.”[8]\r\n\r\nJohn Morrell swore that one of the applicants for the lease of the\r\nferry to Williamsburg applied to some of the Aldermen and was told that\r\nit would cost about $5,000 “to get the grant through.” But a Mr. Hicks,\r\nanother applicant, was so eager to “get it through” that he gave more\r\nthan $20,000.[9]\r\n\r\nThe lease of the Wall Street Ferry was similarly disposed of. Silas C.\r\nHerring testified that he with others was told he could secure it by\r\npaying a certain Alderman $5,000. Herring declined. James B. Taylor\r\nwas another applicant, in 1852. He was informed that it would cost him\r\n$15,000. He offered $10,000, but on the same night “Jake” Sharp offered\r\n$20,000 and got the grant. Taylor also testified that he additionally\r\napplied for the Grand Street Ferry lease. Other parties, however, paid\r\nmore bribe money and obtained it, whereat one Alderman said that “it\r\nwas the damnedest fight that was ever had in the Common Council; it\r\ncost them [Taylor’s rivals] from $20,000 to $25,000.”[10]\r\n\r\nThe Aldermen extorted money in every possible way. In defiance of\r\nthe Mayor’s veto they gave a $600,000 contract for the “Russ” street\r\npavement, afterward found to be worthless, and which had to be replaced\r\nat additional cost. Russ had offered one Assistant Alderman $1,000\r\nto help carry his election the next Fall if he voted favorably.[11]\r\nExorbitant prices were paid for land on Ward’s Island, several Aldermen\r\nand officials receiving for their influence and votes bribes of\r\n$10,000, and others even larger sums.[12] The Common Council sold to\r\nReuben Lovejoy the Gansevoort Market property for $160,000 in the face\r\nof other bids of $225,000 and $300,000. Lovejoy, who, it was disclosed,\r\nwas merely a dummy for James B. Taylor and others, testified “that it\r\nwould cost from $40,000 to $75,000 to get this operation--the purchase\r\nof the Gansevoort property--through the city government.”[13]\r\n\r\nA coal merchant had to pay money for a favorable vote on his\r\napplication for a lease of the Jefferson Market property, and another\r\nmerchant testified to having paid one Assistant Alderman about $1,700\r\nto get a pier lease.[14] The Aldermen demanded and received bribes not\r\nonly for passing measures but for suppressing them, and even invented\r\nmany “strikes,” as instanced by the case of Alderman Smith, who agreed\r\nfor $250 to silence a resolution to reduce the Coroners’ fees.[15]\r\nThey demanded a share of every contract made by any city official,\r\nthreatening, if it were not given, to stop his supplies and have his\r\naccounts investigated.[16] If a contractor or lessee refused to meet\r\na “request,” the Aldermen retaliated by imposing burdens upon him and\r\nreporting hostile resolutions.[17]\r\n\r\nApplicants for the police force paid the Police Captains $40, and more\r\nto the Aldermen who appointed them. One man was reappointed Police\r\nCaptain by Alderman Thomas J. Barr for $200, and another, assistant\r\nCaptain for $100.[18]\r\n\r\nEvery city department was corrupt. It was found that one hundred and\r\nsixty-three conveyances were deeded to the Chief of Police, George W.\r\nMatsell, and his partner, Capt. Norris, in about a year.[19] Matsell\r\nwas mentioned also as receiving money from about one hundred men who\r\npatronized the odious Madame Restell’s establishment in Greenwich\r\nstreet.[20] Both the police and Aldermen collected money from saloons,\r\nthough the Aldermen obtained the larger share, as they had the power of\r\ngranting licenses.\r\n\r\nWithin three or four years William B. Reynolds received over $200,000\r\nfrom the city, under a five-years’ contract for removing dead animals,\r\noffal and bones, though at the time the contract was made other persons\r\nhad offered to remove them free of expense, and one had even offered\r\nto pay the city $50,000 a year for the exclusive privilege.[21] It was\r\nowing to Controller Flagg’s action that a contract to index certain\r\ncity records at a cost of between $200,000 and $300,000, despite the\r\noffer of a well-known publisher to do it for $59,000, was canceled.[22]\r\nFlimsy tenement houses, causing later much fatality and disaster,\r\nwere built in haste, there being no supervisory authority over their\r\nerection.[23] The lighting of the city was insufficient, thousands of\r\noil lamps still being used, and these, according to an old custom, not\r\nbeing lighted on moonlit nights.[24]\r\n\r\nBoth Tammany and Whig Aldermen and officials were implicated in these\r\ndisclosures. Such was the system of city government that, though\r\ntwenty-nine Aldermen were at one time under judgment of contempt of\r\ncourt, and a part of the same number under indictment for bribery, yet\r\nunder the law they continued acting as Judges in the criminal courts.\r\nAccording to Judge Vanderpoel, bribery was considered a joke.\r\n\r\nA new reform movement sprang up, which quickly developed into the\r\nCity Reform party. The reformers proposed, as a first step, to amend\r\nthe charter. The granting of leases for more than ten years was to be\r\nprohibited, and the highest bidder was to get them. A two-thirds vote\r\nwas to be required to pass a bill over the Mayor’s veto. Work to be\r\ndone and supplies furnished costing more than $250 were to be arranged\r\nfor on contract to the lowest bidder. Any person guilty of bribery,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, was to be sentenced, upon conviction, to not\r\nabove ten years in prison and fined not over $5,000, or both. The right\r\nto sit as Judges of the criminal courts was to be taken away from the\r\nAldermen, as was also the power of appointing policemen. The Board of\r\nAssistant Aldermen was to be abolished, and a Board of Councilmen,\r\nconsisting of sixty members, was to be instituted in its place, the\r\ncollective title of the two boards to be “the Common Council.” The\r\nAldermen were to be elected for two years (as determined in the charter\r\nof 1849) and the Councilmen for one year. An efficient auditing of\r\naccounts and claims against the city was called for, and only the more\r\npopular branch of the Common Council was to originate appropriations of\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\nTammany had grown suddenly virtuous again, and responding to the\r\npublic clamor over the disclosures, had declared its devotion to pure\r\ngovernment. At a “reform” meeting of the Young Men’s Union Club, John\r\nCochrane, one of Wood’s lieutenants, who later announced that he would\r\nvote “for the devil incarnate if nominated by Tammany Hall,” declared:\r\n“Reform is at home in Tammany Hall. Its birthplace is Tammany Hall.”\r\nThe purification movement advanced so unmistakably that Tammany\r\napproved the amendments, and the legislative bill embodying some of\r\nthem was supported by the Tammany delegation in the Senate and Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed, and upon being submitted to the people of the city,\r\nin June, 1853, was adopted by the significant vote of 36,000 to 3,000.\r\n\r\nOne of the benefits due to the City Reform party was the reorganization\r\n(1853) of the police under a separate department. The police were\r\ncompelled to wear a uniform against which there had been bitter\r\nprejudice,[25] and the term of appointment was made dependent upon good\r\nbehavior.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the City Reform party, the division between the\r\n“Hardshells” and “Softshells” extending throughout the State caused\r\nthe nomination of separate Democratic tickets in the Fall of 1853.\r\nThere seemed less than ever any vital difference between the professed\r\nprinciples of the two. Under the name of “National Democrats” the\r\n“Hardshells” met in City Hall Park on September 26, and resolved:\r\n\r\n    “We regret that the Democracy of the city are prevented from\r\n    holding this meeting in their accustomed hall.… The Democracy\r\n    of the city waged in time past a successful war against a\r\n    corporation which sought to control by money the political\r\n    destinies of the country. We now from this time forward\r\n    commence a campaign against another corporation known as the\r\n    Tammany Society--a secret, self-elected and irresponsible body\r\n    of men who have dared to usurp the right of determining who\r\n    shall and who shall not meet in Tammany Hall.… The accidental\r\n    ownership of a small equity of redemption of a small part of\r\n    the ground upon which Tammany Hall stands may continue to\r\n    enable the Sachems to prevent the Democracy from meeting within\r\n    the hall, but we can meet in the park or in the open air or\r\n    elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nThe City Reform party nominated acceptable Whigs and Democrats pledged\r\nto reform, and obtained a decisive majority in the next Common Council.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] William H.

The _Tribune_, the chief supporter of the party, admitted\r\nthis (May 3, 1854), declaring that much feeling was manifested over the\r\nfailure of the reformers to realize the public hopes, and attributing\r\nthe failure “to the power of those representing the great political\r\nparties in the two boards to league together and sell out to each other\r\nthe interests of the city as partizan or personal considerations might\r\ndictate.”\r\n\r\nAccordingly, preparations were made to overthrow the new party.\r\nFernando Wood now secured the “Softshell” nomination for Mayor, by\r\npacking the convention with his henchmen. The “Hardshells” held a\r\nseparate convention, which ended in a row, a part nominating Wood, and\r\nthe rest Augustus Schell.\r\n\r\nWood successfully intrigued to cause the Whigs to separate from the\r\nCity Reformers; and to further divide the opposition, Tammany nominated\r\nsham reformers for the lesser city and State offices. The Whigs\r\nnominated for Mayor, John J. Herrick; the City Reformers, Wilson G.\r\nHunt, and the Native Americans, or “Know-Nothings,” springing to life\r\nagain, put forward James W. Barker. Schell, Wood’s Tammany opponent,\r\nwithdrew in favor of Hunt.\r\n\r\nThe disreputable classes, believing that his success meant increased\r\nprosperity to themselves, energetically supported Wood, and the\r\nliquor-dealers formally commended him. In the city at this time were\r\nabout 10,000 shiftless, unprincipled persons who lived by their wits\r\nand the labor of others. The trade of a part of these was turning\r\nprimary elections, packing nominating conventions, repeating and\r\nbreaking up meetings. Most of these were Wood’s active allies.\r\n\r\nHe needed them all on election day. With every resource strained to\r\nthe utmost, he won by a close margin. He was credited with 19,993\r\nvotes; Barker with 18,553; Hunt, 15,386, and Herrick, 5,712. Tammany,\r\ntherefore, succeeded, though in a minority of over 17,000 votes.\r\n\r\nUpon assuming office, Wood surprised his followers by announcing that\r\nhe would purge all offices of corruption and give good government. His\r\nmessages were filled with flattering promises and lofty sentiments.\r\nAt the outset he seemed disposed for good. He closed the saloons on\r\nSunday, suppressed brothels, gambling houses and rowdyism, had the\r\nstreets cleaned, and opened a complaint book. The religious part of the\r\ncommunity for a time believed in him. He assumed personal charge of the\r\npolice, and when a bill was introduced in the Legislature to strip him\r\nof this power, the foremost citizens called a mass meeting to support\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe troubles between the “Hardshells” and “Softshells” continued\r\nthroughout the year 1855. When the latter held their county\r\nratification meeting in the Wigwam and the name of their nominee for\r\nStreet Commissioner was announced, the “Hardshells,” who had come\r\nthither with a nominee of their own, raised an uproar, whereupon “the\r\nfactions on both sides went to work and pummeled each other pretty\r\nsoundly and highly satisfactorily to the lookers, for at least ten\r\nminutes.”\r\n\r\nThe election of 1855 was of little consequence. All eyes were now\r\nturned to the coming contest of 1856. Before the end of a year Wood\r\nhad begun to reveal his real nature. Many of the decent element that\r\nhad for a time believed in him began to turn against him. He had also\r\nmade himself unpopular with certain powerful Sachems by not giving\r\nthem either a share, or a large enough share, in the spoils. His\r\nappointments were made wholly from a circle of personal friends who\r\nwere more attached to him than to the Tammany organization. Knowing\r\nthe folly of expecting a renomination from Tammany, as it was then\r\nconstituted, he set about obtaining it by trickery.\r\n\r\nInducing Wilson Small, a Custom House officer holding a seat in the\r\ngeneral committee, to resign, Wood had himself substituted. Then he\r\npersonally assumed control of the primary election inspectors in every\r\nward, so as to manipulate the election of convention delegates. He\r\ncaused the appointment of an executive committee, which was to have\r\nthe entire choice of inspectors in every instance in which the general\r\ncommittee failed to agree. This new committee was composed mainly of\r\nhis friends, and he named himself chairman.\r\n\r\nHis henchmen incited divisions in such of the wards as were not under\r\nthe control of his inspectors, and the contests, upon being referred to\r\nthe “executive committee,” were of course decided in Wood’s favor. Thus\r\nhe appropriated a great majority of the delegates to the nominating\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n“It is well known,” wrote Peter B. Sweeny and J. Y. Savage, secretaries\r\nof the Tammany General Committee, in a long statement denouncing Wood’s\r\nthimble-rigging “that for many years this [primary] system has been\r\ndegenerating until it has become so corrupt as to be a mere machine in\r\nthe hands of unprincipled men, by which they foist themselves before\r\nthe people as the nominees of a party for office in defiance of public\r\nsentiment.”[1] Sweeny and Savage charged further than when the primary\r\nelections took place under this patent process for cheating the people,\r\nthe ballot boxes were stuffed and detachments of police were stationed\r\nat every poll to aid Wood’s agents and bully his opponents. A sickening\r\nmass of evidence of corruption was at hand, Sweeny and Savage recounted.\r\n\r\nWood was renominated by the city convention, and at an hour when most\r\nof his opponents on the general committee were absent, he had that\r\nbody endorse his nomination by a vote of 56 to 26, nearly all of those\r\nvoting being office-holders by his grace.\r\n\r\nHe also arranged a reconciliation between the “Hardshells” and\r\n“Softshells.” With a show of traditional Tammany custom, the “Softs”\r\nmarched in Indian file to the Stuyvesant Institute, the headquarters of\r\nthe “Hards,” and the reunited leaders marched back to Tammany Hall--in\r\npairs, arm-in-arm. The “Hardshell”-“Softshell” contention thus became a\r\nthing of the past.\r\n\r\nBut Wood’s personal enemies in the Wigwam were not to be appeased,\r\nand they nominated a candidate to oppose him--James S. Libby. Bitter\r\nfeelings were aroused. At the Wood ratification meeting in the\r\nWigwam, October 22, both Wood and Anti-Wood men crowded in, and then\r\nensued another of those clashes for which Tammany Hall had become so\r\ncelebrated. When John Kelly mentioned Wood’s name the Anti-Wood men\r\nraised a din and smothered the speaker’s voice. The Wood men, growing\r\nenraged, “pitched into the Anti-Woodites hot and heavy, and for a\r\ntime a scene of the wildest clamor ensued. A general fight took place\r\nin front of the speaker’s stand and all round the room. Blows were\r\ngiven and exchanged with great spirit, and not a few faces were badly\r\ndisfigured.” After a few planks had been plucked from the stand and\r\nwielded with telling effect, the Wood men won. “The great body of\r\nthe Libbyites were kicked out of the room and down the stairs with a\r\nvelocity proportionate to the expelling force behind.”\r\n\r\nThe City Reform party was far from being satisfied with Wood’s\r\nadministration. In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that by the\r\ntime of his second year in office the blackness of his administration\r\nexceeded anything known before. Seasoned men fancied they knew\r\nsomething of corruption, extravagance and malfeasance in the City Hall,\r\nbut by 1856 they better understood the growth of these under a reckless\r\nand unprincipled Mayor.\r\n\r\nThe saloon power had grown until it controlled the politics of the\r\ncity. In every groggery could be found a crowd of loafers and bruisers\r\nwho could always be relied upon to pack a primary or insure or defeat\r\nthe election of certain nominees. In these saloons the ward politicians\r\nheld their meetings, and the keepers were ready at all times to\r\nfurnish persons to parade, carrying partizan banners they could not\r\nread, or to cheer at mass meetings at the drop of a handkerchief. The\r\nsaloon-keepers also furnished cheap illegal voters, ballot-box stuffers\r\nand thoroughbred “shoulder-hitters,” to intimidate peaceable citizens,\r\nor as a last resort, to smash the ballot boxes.\r\n\r\nThe saloon-keepers were largely above the law. A disingenuous bill,\r\npassed in 1855, ordered the saloons to be closed on Sunday, but made\r\nno provision for enforcement. They were accordingly kept open, likely\r\nenough through assurances from Wood that the owners would not be\r\nmolested. Their support of the Mayor was well-nigh unanimous.\r\n\r\nIt was the domination of politics by this element that caused great\r\nirritation and disgust. But the opposition to Wood was hopelessly\r\ndivided. It had to contend, moreover, with the adverse factor of the\r\nintroduction into the campaign of national issues. The fear of the\r\nnew Republican party was sure to bring out a heavy vote for Buchanan\r\nand Breckinridge, and on the strength of this wave Tammany reasonably\r\nexpected to be again swept into power.\r\n\r\nThe City Reformers had greatly declined in numbers, but they again\r\ncame forward for the contest, nominating Judge James R. Whiting.[2]\r\nThe Native American party, still maintaining its bitterness against\r\nthe control of politics by foreigners, chose Isaac O. Barker, and the\r\nWhigs, Anthony J. Bleecker, making, with Wood and Libby, five Mayoralty\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nThough backed by the dregs of the city on the one hand, Wood did not\r\nneglect to secure some “respectability” on the other. During the\r\ncampaign he received a testimonial signed by some of the leading\r\nbankers and merchants, praising him and his administration and\r\nexpressing the hope of his reelection. Nearly all of the signers, it\r\nwas afterwards disclosed, profited by Wood’s placing of city funds or\r\nbuying of city goods.\r\n\r\nWood sought to force every man on the police force to subscribe to his\r\nelection fund, one policeman, who refused to contribute, being kept on\r\nduty twenty-four hours at a stretch. From this source alone he gathered\r\nin from $8,500 to $10,000.\r\n\r\nOn election day the scum of the town shouted, repeated and bruised for\r\nWood. Candidates were traded openly, and bribing was unconcealed.[3]\r\nThe majority of the policemen were off on furlough, given by the\r\nMayor as head of the Police Department, assisting actively for his\r\nreelection. At the polling places, so terrific was the competition for\r\nthe millions of city plunder, that the Wood and Anti-Wood men fought\r\nsavagely. In the Sixth Ward the Wood partizans, upon being attacked,\r\nretreated for the while, and coming back, armed with brickbats,\r\nclubs, axes and pistols, set upon and routed their foes. The police\r\nmeanwhile calmly looked on, until the riot was at its height, when\r\nthey made a show of concern by firing fifteen or more shots, all of\r\nwhich fortunately went astray. The Wood partizans then broke the ballot\r\nboxes to pieces and carried off the fragments for kindling wood. In the\r\nSeventeenth Ward the Anti-Wood men destroyed some of the Wood boxes;\r\nand in the First, and most of the other wards, the day was enlivened\r\nwith assaults, riots and stabbings.\r\n\r\nThe count of the vote gave Wood, 34,860; Barker, 25,209; Bleecker,\r\n9,654; Libby, 4,764, and Whiting, 3,646. The Buchanan electors carried\r\nthe city with 41,913 votes; Fillmore, the American candidate, and\r\nFremont, Republican, were allowed respectively 19,924 and 17,771 votes.\r\nTammany Hall obtained a serviceable majority in the Common Council.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans maintained that 10,000 fraudulent Democratic votes\r\nwere cast in New York City and Brooklyn, and credited Wood with\r\nhaving profited by the most of those cast in this city. It was not an\r\nunreasonable contention, in view of the enormous increase over the vote\r\nof two years before.\r\n\r\nA few days after the election a meeting in Tammany Hall, called to\r\ncelebrate Buchanan’s triumph, resolved that next to the success of\r\nBuchanan and Breckinridge, “the brightest and most signal achievement\r\nof the Democratic party, at this election, was the triumphant election\r\nof Fernando Wood!”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] This statement was published officially in the New York newspapers,\r\nSeptember 27, 1856.\r\n\r\n[2] Whiting, according to the testimony of James Perkins, before the\r\nSenate Investigating Committee in 1833, had been the chief lobbyist in\r\nthe task of securing the notorious Seventh Ward Bank charter in 1831.\r\nIt is a striking commentary on political standards of the day that\r\nunrebutted charges of such a nature formed no bar to the advancement of\r\na politician to such distinctions as those of Judge, District Attorney\r\nand reform candidate for Mayor.\r\n\r\n[3] Josiah Quincy related, in a lecture in Boston, that while in New\r\nYork City on this election day, he saw $25 given for a single vote\r\nfor a member of Congress. Upon expressing his surprise, Quincy was\r\ntold that this man could afford to pay it. If reelected, it would be a\r\nmoney-making operation. He had received $30,000 at the last session for\r\n“getting a bill through,” and at that rate could afford to pay a good\r\nprice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nWOOD’S SECOND ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n1856-1859\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Wood’s second administration city affairs went from bad to worse.\r\nThe departments reeked with frauds. The city paid Robert W. Lowber\r\n$196,000 for a lot officially declared to be worth only $60,000 and to\r\ntwo-thirds of which, it was proved, Lowber had no title. Controller\r\nFlagg charged that both the Mayor and the Common Council were parties\r\nto it.[1] Fraudulent computations and illegitimate contracts were\r\ncovered by false entries.[2] Amounts on the ledger were revised so\r\nas to steal considerable sums from the city outright.[3] To Bartlett\r\nSmith had been awarded a contract for grading certain streets. Before\r\nbeginning work, however, the Legislature created Central Park out of\r\nthat very territory.[4] Smith demanded $80,000 from the city “for\r\ntrouble in arranging to do the grading”--a claim the Common Council\r\nallowed, but Flagg refused to pay.\r\n\r\nIt was generally charged that Wood sold the office of Street\r\nCommissioner to the notorious Charles Devlin[5] for $50,000 cash, with\r\ncertain reservations as to the patronage and profits. Devlin recouped\r\nhimself; for an investigation revealed that he spent half a million\r\ndollars on contracts of which he was either the real contractor or\r\nsurety, and on which he made the prices 75 per cent higher than they\r\nought to have been.[6] Of how much the city was plundered it was\r\nimpossible to find out, since no reliable accounts of expenditures were\r\nkept in the Finance Department.[7] Not a few officials, relinquishing\r\noffices paying about $2,500 a year, retired loaded with riches and\r\nsurrounded by friends whom they had enriched. Wood himself was now\r\nreputed to be worth $400,000.\r\n\r\nEven the Judiciary was held in general contempt. The Lowber fraud (see\r\nprevious page) was promptly excused and the defendant exonerated by\r\nthe courts. In November, 1855, a City Judge was tried for corruption\r\nin having entered a _nolle prosequi_ in a certain case. The verdict\r\nwas “not guilty,” with this remarkable addition: “And the jury are\r\nunanimously of opinion that in the entry of the _nolle prosequi_ by\r\nthe City Judge he has been guilty of irregularity, and it is the\r\nunanimous recommendation of the jury that Judge ---- resign.” He\r\nresigned.[8] In December, 1855, during a trial for murder in the\r\nSupreme Court, counsel for the defendant exclaimed: “I know the jury\r\nhave too much intelligence to pay any regard to the assumptions of\r\nthe Court.”[9] A man was killed at a prize fight. The Coroner, after\r\nstating the evidence at the inquest, concluded: “If the persons\r\nimplicated are tried before our Court of Sessions they will have reason\r\nto congratulate themselves, as it is a difficult matter in this city\r\nto convict a person charged with any other crime than theft.”[10] In\r\nJanuary, 1856, the seat of one of the Judges of the Supreme Court was\r\ncontested by two candidates, both claiming to have been elected by\r\npopular vote. Both asserted the right to sit; in opposition to the\r\nopinions of the Judges sitting, one of the contestants took and kept\r\nhis seat by pure “nerve.”[11]\r\n\r\nA new city charter, adopted in 1857, changed the date of municipal\r\nelections to the first Tuesday in December, and provided for an\r\nelection for Mayor and Common Council in December, 1857. The change was\r\naimed partly at Wood. He had probably expected severe opposition of\r\nsome kind, for he had early begun planning for the continued control of\r\nthe Tammany General Committee, so as to secure a renomination.\r\n\r\nIn the primary elections, late in 1856, for delegates to this committee\r\nfor 1857, a majority favorable to Wood had been elected, after violence\r\nand ballot-box stuffing in every ward. The Wood men took possession of\r\nthe Wigwam and elected Wilson Small chairman. The rival party met in\r\nanother place and organized a general committee. Each put forward the\r\nclaim of “regularity.”\r\n\r\nAs the “usages” of the party required that the “regular” committee\r\nshould have legal possession of Tammany Hall, it was necessary to\r\ndetermine which that committee was. Then the Sachems stepped in. Seven\r\nof them--a majority of one--were Wood’s personal enemies. By a vote\r\nof seven to five the Sachems concluded to order the election of a new\r\ngeneral committee, which was to have all known Democrats enrolled into\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\n“Tammany Society,” said the “seven Sachems’” report,\r\n\r\n    “is the undisputed owner of Tammany Hall; and the right to\r\n    control the use of that building which is inherent in its\r\n    ownership has been fully secured by the lease. The Council is\r\n    determined that their action shall vindicate fully the rights\r\n    and powers of the venerable society of which they are officers;\r\n    and also, prove a safe and efficient barrier against the tide\r\n    of corruption and fraud which is sapping the power of the great\r\n    party to which the society has adhered during the whole period\r\n    of its existence.”\r\n\r\nAt the society’s annual election, on May 20, the Isaac V. Fowler, or\r\n“reform” ticket, had the names of some men of note--Samuel J. Tilden,\r\nElijah F. Purdy, Peter B. Sweeny, Edward Cooper, William H. Cornell,\r\nJohn McKeon and Emanuel B. Hart--while Wood’s candidates were inferior\r\nhack politicians and nonentities. The “seven Sachems” had previously\r\nmanaged to get into the Wigwam unobserved by the Wood men, and had\r\nrapidly elected nearly sixty new members, all their own partizans, to\r\nthe society.[12] These voted at the election, enabling Wood’s opponents\r\nto beat him by a majority of sixty.[13] Then the “seven Sachems” turned\r\nWood and his men out of the Wigwam.\r\n\r\nIn a public address, the Wood men thereupon declared the society an\r\nirresponsible body of less than four hundred members, one-third of\r\nwhom held no communication with the Democratic party, and that of\r\nits thirteen Sachems seven were “Libby bolters.” “What, then, is\r\nthe issue?” asked the address. “Shall the Sachems rule the people;\r\nor shall the people rule themselves? Shall the Sachems of this\r\nclose corporation, to procure offices for themselves and friends,\r\nbe permitted, unrebuked by the people, to exercise this omnipotent,\r\ndictatorial, supervisory power over the great Democratic party, its\r\norganization and interests, to rule out or rule in your general\r\ncommittees whenever it suit their caprice or selfish purposes?”\r\n\r\nThe control of the police force was considered as necessary as ever\r\nto success at the election. The changes of 1853, from which much\r\nwas hoped, had proved of little benefit. The force was in a chaotic\r\nstate. Political and pecuniary reasons alone guided the appointment\r\nof policemen. No record of merit was kept; there was no systematic\r\ninstruction of policemen in their duties except as to drill. Some\r\nCaptains wore uniforms, others refused. When an applicant appointed to\r\nthe force was tested for qualifications in reading, a large newspaper\r\nwas given to him, and he was told to read the title. Murder abounded,\r\nand the city was full of escaped convicts.[14] One of the most\r\nimportant provisions of a special act of 1857 was the transfer of the\r\npolice from city control to that of the State. Unwilling to surrender\r\nso effective a hold, Wood resisted the Legislature’s action. For a time\r\nthere were two police departments--the Metropolitan force, under the\r\nState Commissioners, and the municipal police, under the Mayor--each\r\ncontending for supremacy. One day a part of the two forces came into\r\ncollision in the City Hall, and twelve men were wounded. It was found\r\nnecessary to summon the militia to quell the disturbances, and Wood was\r\narrested. Finding resistance useless, he submitted grudgingly to the\r\nnew order.[15]\r\n\r\nThe police being so disorganized, the criminal classes ran the town.\r\nChief among Wood’s supporters were the “Dead Rabbits” or “Black\r\nBirds,”--a lawless “gang” who overawed certain portions of the city\r\nand who had a rival in the “Bowery Boys,” whose sole profession seems\r\nto have been to pack primaries, break ballot boxes and fight the “Dead\r\nRabbits.” On July 4, 1857, the “Dead Rabbits,” presumably having\r\nnothing else to do, attacked a body of police in Jackson street. A band\r\nof “Bowery Boys” hurried to the front, and a pitched street battle\r\nensued, pistols and muskets being procured from neighboring places.\r\nBarricades were thrown up in the most approved Parisian style. The\r\nresult was the killing of ten and the wounding of eighty persons, some\r\nof whom were innocent bystanders. This was the most deadly of the\r\nnumerous collisions of these “gangs.” As they had a powerful political\r\ninfluence, the police did not molest them.[16]\r\n\r\nAs a member of the Metropolitan Police Commission, Mayor Wood about\r\nthis time was instrumental in giving out a contract for 4,000 glass\r\nballot boxes, at $15 apiece. It was disclosed in James Horner’s\r\naffidavit before Judge Davis, in the Supreme Court, in November of this\r\nyear, that the city needed no more than 1,200 of the boxes; that Wood’s\r\nbrother had secured the 4,000 boxes at a cost of less than $5 apiece\r\nand that the Mayor was to share in the $40,000 of expected profits.\r\n\r\nWood neglected no means of ingratiating himself with the masses. The\r\npanic of 1857 suddenly deprived over 30,000 mechanics and laborers in\r\nthe city of employment. Wood proposed the employment of the idle on\r\npublic works, and the buying by the city of 50,000 barrels of flour\r\nand an equal amount of other provisions to be disposed of to the\r\nneedy at cost.[17] The Common Council failed to see the value of this\r\nplan, but did appropriate a sum for public works in Central Park, the\r\nbetter share of which went to contractors and petty politicians. To\r\nwin the good will of the Roman Catholics, becoming more and more a\r\npower, the Common Council gave over to the Roman Catholic Orphan Asylum\r\na perpetual lease of the entire plot from Fifth to Fourth avenue,\r\nFifty-first to Fifty-second street, at a rental of $1 a year.[18]\r\n\r\nSo resourceful was Wood and so remarkable his political ingenuity that\r\nthough he and his general committee were driven out by the Tammany\r\nSociety, he nevertheless brought things about so that the Democratic\r\nconvention in Tammany Hall, on October 15, renominated him for Mayor,\r\nby 75 votes to 12. The Tammany General Committee thereupon openly\r\nrepudiated him, and the curious complication was presented of a\r\ncandidate who was the Tammany “regular” nominee, yet opposed by both\r\nthe society and the general committee.\r\n\r\nInstantly a determined citizen’s movement to defeat him sprang up.\r\nThe city taxes had nearly doubled in the three years of Wood’s\r\nadministration and were now over $8,000,000, of which over $5,000,000\r\nhad already been signed away in contracts or spent in advance of\r\ncollection. Yet the Common Council had recently resolved to spend the\r\nexorbitant sum of $5,000,000 on a new City Hall. The Mayor vetoed the\r\nresolution only when the most intense public opposition was manifested.\r\n\r\nA committee of citizens, representative of the Republicans, Democrats\r\nand Native Americans, nominated Daniel F. Tiemann, a paint dealer, and\r\na member of Tammany Hall, but who was an Alderman and as Governor of\r\nthe Almshouse had made a good record.\r\n\r\nTo Wood’s support there concentrated the preponderance of the foreign\r\nborn, the native rowdies and the usual mass blinded into voting for\r\nthe “regular” ticket. The gamblers, brothel-keepers, immigrant runners\r\nand swindlers of every kind bought and cheated for him in the belief\r\nthat the reformers would drive them from the city. Wood had taken\r\nthe precaution to manufacture thousands of voters. From the Wigwam,\r\nwhere the Wood partizans backed up their right to meet with fists,\r\ndrummers-up were sent to bring in prospective citizens. Upon promising\r\nfaithfully to vote the Tammany ticket, a card, valued at fifty cents,\r\nwas furnished gratuitously to each. It was addressed to a Judge who\r\nowed his election to Tammany, and read:\r\n\r\n    “Common Pleas:\r\n\r\n    “Please naturalize the bearer.\r\n\r\n    “N. Seagrist, chairman.”[19]\r\n\r\nFrom 3,000 to 4,000 voters, it was estimated, were turned out by this\r\nprocess.\r\n\r\nThe sentiment of certain politicians may be taken from John\r\nCochrane’s[20] remark that “he would vote for the devil incarnate if\r\nnominated by Tammany Hall.” Meanwhile they took care to make out Wood\r\nto be a much-abused man. At the ratification meeting in Tammany Hall,\r\non November 23, long resolutions were passed, fulsomely flattering Wood\r\nand asking voters to remember that if Wood was assailed, so Jefferson,\r\nJackson and Daniel Webster were pursued to their graves by harpies. The\r\nvoters were asked not to be deceived by the abuse of the graceless,\r\ngodless characters and disappointed demagogues.\r\n\r\nWood and his partizans strained every nerve for success. But it was a\r\nfutile effort. The opposition won, Tiemann receiving 43,216 votes, to\r\n40,889 for Wood. His large vote, however, showed the dangerous strength\r\nof the worst classes of the city, and boded ill for the years to come.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of the Tammany Society and the general committee having\r\nbeen responsible for his defeat, Wood made renewed efforts to regain\r\nsway over both. On their part, elated at his supposed downfall, the\r\nAnti-Wood members of the general committee decided to expel Daniel E.\r\nSickles and C. Godfrey Gunther, two of his supporters, and met for that\r\npurpose in the Wigwam on December 9, 1857.\r\n\r\nWood’s followers thought proper to impress upon the general committee a\r\nsense of their strength. Accordingly, their fighting men were present\r\nin full force, awaiting an opportunity to mingle in the proceedings.\r\nThe probability of a violent row increasing momentarily, the\r\nMetropolitan police were summoned to Tammany Hall. For a time they kept\r\nthe hostiles within bounds; but the bar was well patronized, and large\r\ndelegations of the “Dead Rabbits” and “shoulder-hitters” from the wards\r\nwere flowing in constantly.\r\n\r\nAt 9 o’clock a desperate fight was begun in the center of the bar-room,\r\namid intense excitement. By using their clubs unsparingly, the forty\r\npolicemen succeeded in separating the combatants, though not before a\r\nyoung man, Cornelius Woods, had been shot in the shoulder with a slug.\r\nUnwilling to draw upon themselves the resentment of the influential\r\nward politicians, the police made no arrests. The meeting broke up\r\nwithout definite action being taken in the matter of expelling the two\r\nsupporters of Wood.\r\n\r\nThe first and chief point in the struggle for the control of the\r\norganization was, as usual, the control of the Tammany Society. Both\r\nfactions were alive to this necessity. On April 13, 1858, 150 members\r\nof the society met at the Westchester House, Bowery and Broome streets,\r\nwhere it was announced that 212 members were pledged to vote for\r\nAnti-Wood Sachems. Some of these members were seeking the ascendency\r\nfor their own benefit, while others were not active in politics at all,\r\nbut had become disgusted with Wood’s methods and men. At the election,\r\nsix days later, the Anti-Wood ticket, headed by Isaac V. Fowler and\r\nNelson J. Waterbury, won by a majority of nearly 100, 378 members\r\nvoting. More than twenty members who had not been at an election of the\r\nsociety for twenty years or more, and a large number who had eschewed\r\nvoting for ten years, hastened, some from distances, to deposit\r\ntheir votes. Three came from Hudson, a number from Albany, two from\r\nWashington, and one from Cincinnati.\r\n\r\nThe result was Wood’s forced withdrawal from the organization. He\r\nimmediately started a Democratic organization opposed to Tammany and\r\nupon the same lines. It was known generally as “Mozart Hall,” from the\r\nname of the assembly room in which it met. Wood denounced Tammany,\r\ndeclaring that its nominees were chosen by five members of the Tammany\r\nSociety, in a parlor, and ferociously expressed his determination to\r\nwage war upon the society as long as he lived until (this reservation\r\nwas added) “it opened its doors.”\r\n\r\nEach hall, as a matter of political business, made the most virtuous\r\nand the strongest claims of being the true Democratic organization.\r\nEach execrated the other and announced itself as the sole, valiant,\r\nsincere upholder of Democracy.\r\n\r\nWood’s enemies made haste to guarantee their ascendency when, on\r\nDecember 28, the Sachems ordered elections for the committees to be\r\nheld on December 30, thus giving but _one day’s_ notice of the event.\r\nMoreover, they forced upon all persons accepting membership in the\r\ncommittees, a pledge that in case of their election they would support\r\nthe Tammany organization and all nominations made under its authority,\r\nand disclaim allegiance to any other organization, party or clique.\r\n\r\nThe election of delegates to the various nominating conventions, in the\r\nFall of 1858, was attended by the customary disorder. Wood’s partizans\r\nwere everywhere inciting trouble. At O’Connell’s Hall, on Mulberry\r\nstreet, a crowd, seeing that the result was unfavorable to their side,\r\nsplit the ballot boxes and threw them into the street. The “Dead\r\nRabbits,” scenting trouble, appeared hastily, and a fight ensued on\r\nHester street, in which two of them were shot.\r\n\r\nThis municipal election was the first in which the Democratic voters\r\nof Irish nativity or lineage insisted on a full share of the best\r\nplaces on the party’s ticket. Previously they had seldom been allowed\r\nany local office above Coroner. Their dominance on the Tammany ticket\r\nagain roused the “Know-Nothing” sentiment, and a combination of Native\r\nAmericans, Republicans and independents resulted. The combination\r\nsecured 16 of the 24 Councilmen.\r\n\r\nThe politicians were now confronted with a registry act, which omitted\r\nthe blunder of that of 1840 in applying only to New York City. This\r\nmeasure became a law in 1859, despite the stubborn opposition of\r\nTammany, some of whose leaders, Isaac V. Fowler and others, issued an\r\naddress asking Democrats to arise and defeat it. Failing to defeat it,\r\nthey resolved to circumvent it by means of the Board of Supervisors,\r\nwhich was required to appoint the registry clerks. This body was by\r\nlaw divided equally as to politics, the Legislature calculating that\r\nthis would insure fair dealing. But by the purchase of the vote of one\r\nof the Republican Supervisors for $2,500,[21] the Tammany members\r\nwere enabled not only to redistrict the city to their own advantage,\r\nbut to appoint trusted tools as registrars. For appearances’ sake\r\nthey allowed a Republican registry clerk here and there. Of 609\r\nregistrars appointed, the Republicans secured about 75; and of the\r\nwhole 609, 68 were liquor-sellers, 92 were petty office-holders, 34\r\nwere supposed gamblers, and 50 of the names were not in the city\r\ndirectory. The Tammany leaders held daily private caucuses, and made\r\na list of henchmen with extreme care, in order to exclude Wood from\r\nany influence with the registry clerks. William M. Tweed, a member of\r\nthe board, generally named the men, and Elijah F. Purdy boasted that\r\nTammany demanded the appointment of none but Democrats, and that they\r\n(the Tammany Supervisors) meant to sustain their party at any and all\r\nhazards. Having the registry clerks, Tammany Hall could revel in false\r\nregistry and repeating. Good citizens, dejected at the outlook, were\r\nsure of a repetition of the frauds of former years.\r\n\r\nSeeking to satisfy all parties, Mayor Tiemann failed to satisfy any.\r\nHe was accused of using the official patronage for the advantage of\r\nTammany Hall, in the hope of getting a renomination from it in 1859. He\r\nand his chief office-holders appointed to the office the most notorious\r\nfighting men and ruffians in the city. The Tammany leaders did not\r\nfavor him, possibly because they thought William F. Havemeyer a man of\r\nmore weight, popularity and respectability.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they nominated the latter. Wood had himself nominated by\r\nMozart Hall, and the Republicans chose George P. Opdyke, a millionaire.\r\nIn this triangular contest the Tammany men felt that the force of\r\nHavemeyer’s good record would put them in power. Singularly, however,\r\nwith all its manipulation of the registry lists, and the excellent\r\ncharacter of its nominee, Tammany lost. The Irish voters sided almost\r\nsolidly with Wood, and the lowest classes of the city, fearing the\r\nelection of a man so distasteful to them as Havemeyer or Opdyke, used\r\nall their effectiveness for Wood, who received 29,940 votes, against\r\n26,913 for Havemeyer, and 21,417 for Opdyke.\r\n\r\nIt was conceded that much of the worst part of Tammany’s strength had\r\ngone over to Wood. This fact was suggestive, to a degree, of Wood’s\r\nassurance, considering the declaration in his letter of acceptance of\r\nthe nomination that he favored “excluding the bullies and rowdies from\r\npublic employment and of dealing summarily with that class of outlaws.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Tammany had nominated a good man, for the sake of sliding into\r\npower upon the strength of his reputation, its lesser candidates were\r\ngenerally incompetent or of bad character; half a dozen of its nominees\r\nfor Councilmen were under indictment for various crimes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Documents of the Board of Aldermen_, 1859, No. 16. The courts\r\ndecided later in favor of Lowber. As Controller Flagg refused to\r\npay the claim on the ground of no funds being “applicable,” Lowber\r\ncaused the Sheriff to sell at auction, in October, 1858, the City Hall\r\nwith its equipment and paintings to satisfy a judgment of $228,000,\r\nincluding damages, costs and interest. Mayor Tiemann bid the City\r\nHall in for the sum of $50,000, and turned it over to the city when\r\nreimbursed. _Documents of the Board of Aldermen_, 1859, Vol. XXVI, No.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, Vol. XXIII, No. 42; also _Ibid._, Vol. XXV, No. 10.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[4] The Act was passed July 21, 1853. This was one of the very few\r\npublic-spirited measures of the time. Tammany, however, immediately\r\nbegan to utilize the measure, through contracts for the clearing and\r\nimprovement of the park, to the profit of its leaders and followers.\r\n\r\n[5] Devlin was appointed by Mayor Wood to succeed Joseph S. Taylor,\r\ndeceased. At the same time Daniel D. Conover was selected for the post\r\nby the Governor, who claimed the right of appointment. The Mayor used\r\ninflammatory language, a turbulent mob gathered, and the militia had\r\nto be ordered out to prevent serious violence between the partizans of\r\neach. (_Assembly Documents_, 1858, No. 80.) The courts later decided in\r\nfavor of Devlin.\r\n\r\n[6] Devlin was removed from office by Mayor Tiemann in April, 1858.\r\n\r\n[7] _Report of Special Common Council Committee_, October 22, 1857.\r\n\r\n[8] _Harper’s New Monthly Magazine_, November, 1856.\r\n\r\n[9] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[11] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[12] Statement to the author by Douglas Taylor, one of the “seven\r\nSachems.”\r\n\r\n[13] Of this action Talcott Williams (_Tammany Hall_, G. P. Putnam’s\r\nSons, 1898) says: “For the first time, the Tammany Society, which\r\nis only the landlord of the political body which leases its hall,\r\nexercised its singular power of deciding between rival organizations.”\r\nThis, of course, is a decided error. Repeated instances of the activity\r\nof the society in this direction have been given in this work.\r\n\r\n[14] _Assembly Documents_, 1857, II, part 2, No. 127.\r\n\r\n[15] _Assembly Documents,_ 1858, No. 80. The chaos produced during this\r\ndispute was extreme. Members of one force would seize and liberate\r\nprisoners taken by the other force, combats were frequent, and\r\npeaceable citizens were often unable to secure protection.\r\n\r\n[16] This riot is briefly treated in Document No. 80.\r\n\r\n[17] _Proceedings of the Board of Aldermen_, Vol. LXVII, pp. 157-60.\r\n\r\n[18] _Ibid._, Vol. LXVIII, p. 140.\r\n\r\n[19] This reference to Seagrist was handed down in an Aldermanic\r\ncommittee’s report some years before: “… Thomas Munday, Nicholas\r\nSeagrist, Captain Norris, Mackellar and others were charged with\r\n_robbing the funeral pall of Henry Clay_, when his sacred person passed\r\nthrough this city.” _Documents of the Board of Aldermen_, Vol. XXII:\r\nNo. 43.\r\n\r\n[20] Cochrane later followed Wood into Mozart Hall, but subsequently\r\nreturned to Tammany Hall. He was elected to Congress, serving one term.\r\nHe raised a regiment at the outbreak of the Civil War, and in June,\r\n1862, was made a Brigadier-General. He was elected Attorney-General\r\nof the State in 1863. In 1872 he joined the Greeley movement. He held\r\nvarious local offices, both in 1872 and in 1883 being elected to the\r\nPresidency of the Board of Aldermen. As late as 1889 he was a Sachem.\r\nHe died in 1898, in his 85th year.\r\n\r\n[21] Statement of William M. Tweed before a special investigating\r\ncommittee of the Board of Aldermen, 1877 (_Document No. 8_, _Documents\r\nof the Board of Aldermen,_ Vol. II, pp. 15-16). Isaac V. Fowler, Tweed\r\ntestified, furnished the $2,500 which was paid to Peter R. Voorhis, a\r\nRepublican member. Tweed further stated, that besides himself there\r\nwere in the conspiracy Elijah F. Purdy, William C. Conner, Isaac Bell,\r\nJr. (a Sachem) and John R. Briggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE CIVIL WAR AND AFTER\r\n\r\n1859-1867\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stirring years of the Civil War were drawing near. In this\r\ncrisis, Tammany, ever pro-slavery, dealt in no equivocal phrases. On\r\nNovember 1, 1859, at a meeting called to order by Isaac V. Fowler,\r\nJames T. Brady, acting as president, referred to John Brown’s raid as\r\n“riot, treason and murder.” Brady and others spoke dolefully of the\r\ndire consequences of a continuation of the abolition agitation and\r\nprophesied that if the “irrepressible conflict” ever came, it would\r\nresult in an extermination of the black race.\r\n\r\nBut Grand Sachem Fowler was not to officiate at any more meetings. He\r\nhad been living for several years at a rate far beyond his means. In\r\none year his bill at the New York Hotel, which he made the Democratic\r\nheadquarters, amounted to $25,000.[1] He had spent $50,000 toward the\r\nelection of Buchanan. A social favorite, he gave frequent and lavish\r\nentertainments.[2] President Pierce had appointed him Postmaster, but\r\nthe salary was only $2,500 a year, and he had long ago exhausted his\r\nprivate means and much of the property of his family. It was therefore\r\na source of wonder whence his money came. The problem was cleared\r\nup when, on May 10, 1860, he was removed from office, and an order\r\nwas issued for his arrest under the accusation of having embezzled\r\n$155,000.[3] The filching, it appeared, had been going on since 1855.[4]\r\n\r\nIsaiah Rynders, then United States Marshal at New York, upon receiving\r\norders to arrest Fowler, went to his hotel, but tarried at the bar\r\nand by his loud announcement of his errand, allowed word to be taken\r\nto Fowler, who forthwith escaped. He subsequently made his way to\r\nMexico. His brother, John Walker Fowler, who upon recommendation of\r\nthe “seven Sachems” had been appointed clerk to Surrogate Gideon J.\r\nTucker, subsequently absconded with $31,079.65 belonging to orphans and\r\nothers.[5]\r\n\r\nIn 1860 Tammany was greatly instrumental in inducing the Democrats\r\nof New York State to agree upon a fusion Douglas-Bell-Breckinridge\r\nelectoral ticket. On the registration and election days the frauds\r\npractised against the Lincoln electors surpassed anything the city\r\nhad known. In the Third Ward 63 fictitious names were registered\r\nin a single election district. Five hundred of the 3,500 names\r\nof the Twelfth Ward register were found to be fraudulent. In the\r\nSeventeenth Ward 935 names on the registry books were spurious, no\r\npersons representing them being discoverable at the places given as\r\ntheir residences. An Irish widow’s two boys, six and seven years old\r\nrespectively, were registered, mother and sons, of course, knowing\r\nnothing of it--and so on _ad libitum_. Fictitious names, accredited to\r\nvacant lots or uninhabited buildings, were voted by the thousands.\r\nThe announcement of the result gave the Fusionists 62,611 votes, and\r\nLincoln 33,311.\r\n\r\nAt the outbreak of the war, Mozart Hall, for purposes of political\r\ndisplay, took a prompt position in favor of maintaining the Union,\r\nalthough Wood, its master spirit, advocated, in a public message, the\r\ndetaching of New York City from the Union and transforming it into a\r\nfree city on the Hamburg plan.[6] Tammany, perforce, had to follow the\r\nlead of Mozart Hall in parading its loyalist sentiments. The society\r\nraised a regiment, which was taken to the field in June, 1861, by Grand\r\nSachem William D. Kennedy.[7] Tammany long dwelt upon this action as a\r\ncrowning proof of its patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe real sentiments of the bulk of Tammany and of Mozart Hall were to\r\nthe contrary. Both did their best to paralyze the energies of Lincoln’s\r\nadministration. In a speech to his Mozart Hall followers at the Volks\r\nGarden, on November 27, 1861, Wood charged the national administration\r\nwith having provoked the war, and said that they (the administration)\r\nmeant to prolong it while there was a dollar to be stolen from the\r\nnational Treasury or a drop of Southern blood to be shed. At the\r\nTammany celebration of July 4, 1862, Grand Sachem Nelson J. Waterbury,\r\nthough expressing loyalty to the Union, averred that it was the\r\nPresident’s duty “to set his foot firmly upon abolitionism and crush it\r\nto pieces, and then the soldiers would fight unembarrassed, and victory\r\nmust soon sit upon the National banners.” Declarations of this kind\r\nwere generally received with enthusiasm in both halls.\r\n\r\nAt times, however, under the sting of severe public criticism, Tammany\r\nHall made haste to assert its fealty to the Union cause. In September,\r\n1861, Elijah F. Purdy, chairman of its general committee, issued a\r\nstatement that “Tammany Hall had maintained an unswerving position\r\nupon this great question from the time the first gun was fired to the\r\npresent hour. It has been zealously devoted to the Union, in favor of\r\nupholding it with the utmost resources of the nation, and opposed to\r\nany action calculated to embarrass the Government or to prevent all\r\nloyal men from standing together in solid column for the country.”\r\nTammany put forth the claim that “three-fourths of the volunteer\r\nsoldiers enlisted in this city and at the seat of war, are Democrats\r\nattached to Tammany Hall”; and on October 3, 1861, resolved that with\r\na deep sense of the peril in which the Union and the Constitution were\r\ninvolved by the reckless war being waged for their destruction by armed\r\ntraitors, it (Tammany Hall) held it to be the first and most sacred\r\nduty of every man who loved his country to support the Government.\r\n\r\nThe war, which so engaged and diverted the popular mind, served as a\r\ncover for the continued manipulation of primaries and conventions,\r\nand the consummation of huge schemes of public plunder. Wood himself\r\npointed out that from 1850 to 1860 the expenses of the city government\r\nhad increased from over $3,200,000 to $9,758,000, yet his tenure of\r\noffice from 1860 to 1862 was characterized by even worse corruption\r\nthan had flourished so signally in his previous terms. After his\r\ninstallation, in 1860, it was charged that he had sold the office of\r\nCity Inspector to Samuel Downes, a man of wealth, for $20,000; that\r\nDownes had paid $10,000 to certain confederates of Wood, and that he\r\nhad afterward been cheated out of the office. Another charge, the facts\r\nof which were related in a presentment by the Grand Jury, accused Wood\r\nof robbing the taxpayers of $420,000. The Common Council had awarded a\r\nfive-years’ street-cleaning contract to Andrew J. Hackley, at $279,000\r\na year, notwithstanding the fact that one among other responsible\r\npersons had bid $84,000 a year less. Afraid to submit the contract to\r\nthe ordeal of public opinion, which might give rise to injunctions,\r\nthe Common Council sped it through both boards on the same night.\r\nWaiting in his office until nearly midnight for the express purpose\r\nof signing it, the Mayor hastily affixed his signature the moment it\r\nreached him. The Grand Jury found that the sum of $40,000 in bribes had\r\nbeen raised and paid for the passage of the contract. It was asserted\r\nthat the equivalent Wood received for signing the bill was one-fourth\r\nthe amount of the contract, or $69,750 a year, for five years, free of\r\nany other consideration than his signature, the other beneficiaries\r\nof the contract supplying all the money needed to protect the fraud.\r\nSpurred on by public opinion, the police--when the work was not done in\r\ncompliance with the contract--had reported to the Controller, who had\r\nrefused to pay the monthly bills. Then the contractors reduced the pay\r\nof their laborers from $1.25 to 95 cents a day in order to make good\r\ntheir payments to Wood.[8]\r\n\r\nHiram Ketchum, in November, 1861, publicly accused Wood of promising\r\ntwo men--Woodruff and Hoffman--Mozart Hall nominations for Judgeships,\r\nupon which they each paid $5,000 in checks to Wood’s account for\r\n“election expenses.” Pocketing the money, Wood then made an agreement\r\nwith Tammany to unite on two other men--Monell and Barbour--for Judges,\r\non condition that Tammany should not unite with the Republicans against\r\nhim in the December Mayoralty election.\r\n\r\nS. B. Chittenden, a citizen of wealth and standing, charged, in Cooper\r\nInstitute, November 26, 1861, that the signature of the Street Cleaning\r\nCommissioner necessary for certain documents could be bought for\r\n$2,500, and intimated that Wood was not dissociated from the procedure.\r\n\r\nWood had spent an enormous amount in his political schemes. He himself\r\nadmitted, according to the testimony of A. W. Craven, Chief Engineer of\r\nthe Croton Aqueduct Department, before a committee of Aldermen, “that\r\nhis object in removing heads of departments was to get control of the\r\ndepartments, so that he could put in those who would cooperate with him\r\nand, also, could pay off his obligations.”[9]\r\n\r\nIt is possible to give only an outline of the “jobs” stealthily put\r\nthrough the Common Council. Newspaper criticism was, in a measure,\r\nsilenced by appropriations of from $10,000 to $20,000 a year for\r\n“advertising,” though occasional exposures were made in spite of this.\r\nOne of these related to the appropriation of $105,000 in July, 1860,\r\nfor a few days’ entertainment of the Japanese Embassy in New York. Of\r\nthis sum only a few thousand dollars were used for the purpose, the\r\nrest being stolen.[10]\r\n\r\nNever more than now was patriotism shown to be the last refuge of\r\nscoundrels. Taking advantage of the war excitement, the most audacious\r\ndesigns on the city treasury were executed under color of acts of the\r\npurest patriotism. At a special meeting of the Common Council, on\r\nAugust 21, 1861, called ostensibly to help the families of the poor\r\nvolunteers, a measure providing for the appointment of twenty-two\r\nStreet Opening Commissioners was hurriedly passed, upon motion of\r\nAlderman Terence Farley, against whom several untried indictments\r\nwere pending. Without entering into details, it can be said that this\r\naction represented a theft of $250,000, in that the Commissioners were\r\nsuperfluous, and their offices were created merely to make more places\r\nfor a hungry host of political workers.\r\n\r\nIf the city was a richer prize than ever to the politicians, the\r\nLegislature was no less desirable. Alien members of both branches of\r\nthat body were under the complete domination of political managers.\r\nIt was notorious that the Democratic and the Republican lobby lords\r\nexchanged the votes of their respective legislative vassals, so that it\r\nmattered little to either which political party had the ascendency in\r\nthe Legislature. One celebrated lobbyist declared that it was cheaper\r\nto buy, than to elect, a Legislature. The passage of five franchises by\r\nthe Legislature, on April 17, 1860, over Gov. Morgan’s veto, cost the\r\nprojectors upwards of $250,000 in money and stock.[11]\r\n\r\nApparently hostile, the leaders of Tammany and of Mozart Hall soon saw\r\nthat it was to their mutual benefit to have a secret understanding\r\nas to the division of the spoils. While Mozart had supremacy for the\r\nmoment, Tammany had superior advantages. It could point to a long\r\nrecord; its organization was perfect; it had a perpetual home, and\r\nthe thousands of its disappointed ward-workers and voters who had\r\ntransferred their allegiance to Mozart, in the hope of better reward,\r\nwould certainly flow back in time. This changing about was an old\r\nfeature of New York politics. A successful political party was always\r\ndepleted by thousands of office-seekers who left its ranks because\r\ndisappointed in their hopes. Most important of all, Tammany had dealt\r\nthe decisive blow to Mozart Hall at the Charleston convention, in 1860,\r\nand at the Syracuse convention, in September, 1861, when its delegation\r\nsecured the recognition of “regularity.”\r\n\r\nHence Mozart Hall, to avoid losing the State offices, willingly\r\nbargained with Tammany, and in the Fall of 1861 the two combined on\r\nnominees for the Legislature. They could not agree on the Mayoralty,\r\nWood determining to stand for reelection. But true to their agreement\r\nnot to ally themselves with the Republicans, the Tammany leaders\r\nnominated independently, selecting C. Godfrey Gunther. Once more a\r\nnon-partizan movement sprang up to combat the forces of corruption.\r\nThe People’s Union, composed of Republicans and Democrats, succeeded,\r\ndespite the usual frauds, in electing George P. Opdyke, a Republican,\r\nby less than 1,000 plurality, he receiving 25,380 votes; Gunther,\r\n24,767; and Wood 24,167. In violation of the law, returns in ten\r\ndistricts were held back for evident purposes of manipulation. When the\r\nfigures showed Opdyke’s election, attempts were made to deprive him\r\nof his certificate on the pretense that the returns as published in\r\nthe daily newspapers were inaccurate. After much counting by the Board\r\nof Aldermen, whose attempt at “counting out” Opdyke was frustrated by\r\nthe vigilance of his friends, the latter was declared elected by 613\r\nplurality.\r\n\r\nNewspaper accounts described a lively time, quite in keeping with a\r\nlong line of precedents, in Tammany Hall on election night. The crowd\r\nwas in unpleasant humor because of Gunther’s defeat. When “Jimmy”\r\nNesbit, a good-natured heeler of the Sixth Ward, was called upon to\r\npreside, he tried to evoke cheers for Gunther. Chafing at the lack\r\nof enthusiasm, he swore fiercely at his hearers. A shout was heard,\r\n“Three cheers for Fernando Wood,” whereupon the eminent chairman lost\r\nhis equanimity and let fly a pitcher at the offender’s head. He was\r\non the point of heaving another missile, a large pewter pitcher,\r\nbut a bystander caught his hand. Cries of “Tammany is not dead yet,”\r\nwere heard, and then Chauncey Shaeffer regaled the crowd with the\r\ninformation that he got his first meal, with liquor thrown in, at\r\nTammany Hall, sixteen years before, and he would never desert her.\r\nShaeffer told the Tammanyites how he had gone to the White House and\r\nadvised the President to let out the job of putting down the rebellion\r\nto Tammany Hall. Cries broke forth of, “You’re drunk, Shaeffer!”\r\n“You’re a disgrace to Tammany Hall.” After trying to sing “The Red,\r\nWhite and Blue,” Shaeffer stumbled off the platform. Isaiah Rynders\r\nthen arose, and after denouncing the leaders for not being there,\r\nassured his hearers that there were many respectable gentlemen present\r\nand some d--d fools. This edifying meeting ended by “the chairman\r\njumping from the platform and chasing a Wood man out of the room.”\r\n\r\nThough no longer in office, Wood was still a powerful factor, since\r\nMozart Hall, of which he was the head, could poll, or pretend to poll,\r\n25,000 votes. Further overtures were made between him and the leaders\r\nof Tammany in 1862, with the result that an understanding was reached\r\nto divide the nominations equally. The partition was conducted amicably\r\nuntil the office of Surrogate was reached. Besides this there was an\r\nodd member of the Assembly not accounted for. The leaders could not\r\nagree as to how these two offices should be disposed of, and on the\r\nevening of October 2 the general committee met in the Wigwam to discuss\r\nthe profound problem. Crowds were gathered inside and outside the hall,\r\nin the lobby, bar-room and on the stairs. The excitement was such that\r\na squad of police was sent to the scene to maintain peace.\r\n\r\nTheir services were needed. Heated discussions had been going on all\r\nthe evening. Richard B. Connolly had his “party” on hand, eager for the\r\nfray. Francis I. A. Boole mustered his retainers by the score--“fine\r\nstrapping fellows, with upturned sleeves and significant red shirts\r\nthat told of former battles and hard-earned laurels.” At 11 o’clock the\r\nfighting began. It had not progressed far, however, when the police\r\ncharged, and wielding their clubs right and left, drove the combatants\r\nin disorder into the street. The committee was in session nearly all\r\nnight, but a renewal of the scrimmage was not attempted.\r\n\r\nAfter much haggling, the factions finally agreed. Nominations\r\nbrought such great sums that the severe contention of the leaders\r\nis easily explainable. A hint of the enormous sums wrung from this\r\nsource was given by Judge Maynard, when addressing a meeting of the\r\n“Representative Democracy,” in Cooper Union, on October 27, 1863. He\r\nstated that one man in Mozart Hall (doubtless referring to Fernando\r\nWood) was the chief of all the “strikers” in New York City, and that\r\nthis person made from $100,000 to $200,000 every year marketing\r\noffices.[12] Nominations and appointments went to the highest bidders,\r\nand some of the leaders held as many as thirteen different offices\r\neach. At the same meeting W. R. Ranken stated that “the manner in\r\nwhich these two organizations--Tammany and Mozart Hall--have packed\r\ntheir preliminary conventions and organizations, has been of such a\r\ncharacter as to bring the blush of shame to every man of principle in\r\nthe party. No man, were he to poll 10,000 votes, under those primary\r\nelections, could be admitted within the precincts of Tammany Hall\r\nunless he came with the indorsement of the Election Inspectors who were\r\nunder the influence of the two or three men who held the reins of power\r\nthere.”[13]\r\n\r\nThe State and Congressional elections in November showed the power of\r\nthe combined halls. Seymour, for Governor, carried the city by 31,309\r\nplurality. Among the Democratic Congressmen elected was Fernando Wood,\r\nwho, evidently despairing of again filling the Mayor’s chair, had\r\ndetermined to employ his activities in another field.\r\n\r\nThe city election for minor officers occurred in December, and the two\r\nhalls again won. The apportionment of the offices, however, caused a\r\nnumber of clashes. One of the offices filled was that of Corporation\r\nCounsel, the nomination to which fell to the lot of Mozart Hall. Wood\r\nhad promised it to John K. Hackett, subsequently Recorder, but gave it\r\nto John E. Devlin, a Sachem, supposed to be one of Wood’s bitterest\r\nopponents. By way of smoothing Hackett’s ire, Wood promised to have him\r\nappointed Corporation Attorney. This promise was also broken. Hackett\r\nwent to Wood’s house and was shown into his parlor. “Mr. Wood,” said\r\nHackett, as soon as the man who had been thrice Mayor of the metropolis\r\nof America appeared, “I called to say to you, personally, that you are\r\na scoundrel, a rascal and a perjured villain.” Wood threatened to put\r\nhim out and rang the bell. As the servant was on the point of entering,\r\nHackett drew a revolver from his pocket and went on: “If that man comes\r\nbetween us, I shall blow out his brains and cut off your ears. So you\r\nmay as well listen. On a certain night, in a room of the Astor House,\r\nwere four persons, Mr. D., Mr. X., Mr. Y., and yourself. One of these\r\nfour is a scoundrel, a rascal, a perjured villain and a hound. It is\r\nnot Mr. D., nor Mr. X., nor Mr. Y. Who he is, I leave you to imagine.”\r\n\r\nThe degraded state of politics, sinking yearly still lower, caused\r\nunspeakable disgust, but the honest element of the citizenship seemed\r\npowerless. The occasional election of a reform Mayor made little\r\ndifference in the situation, for either through the impotence of\r\nhis position or his personal incompetency, the spoilsmen managed to\r\nprevail. The Common Council was the supreme power, and this body\r\nTammany, or Tammany and Mozart together, generally controlled. The\r\npublic money was spent as the Aldermen pleased. The Mayor’s veto became\r\na legal fiction, for a bare majority[14] sufficed to overcome it, and\r\nthis could generally be secured through deals and the trading of votes\r\non one another’s “jobs.” The veto, in the words of a later Mayor,\r\namounted “to nothing more than the publication of his remonstrance in\r\ncorporation newspapers, to cause a few hours’ delay and excite the\r\ncontempt of the members [of the Common Council] who have determined to\r\ncarry their measure in spite of his remonstrance.”[15]\r\n\r\nPublic indignation resulted in another anti-Tammany demonstration of\r\nstrength in 1863. The Wigwam nominated for Mayor, Francis I. A. Boole,\r\ngenerally considered as nauseating a type of the politician as Tammany\r\ncould bring forth. Independent Democrats and some Republicans thereupon\r\nrallied to the support of C. Godfrey Gunther, nominee of a new “reform”\r\norganization--the “McKeon Democracy.” The Republican organization,\r\nhowever, stood apart, nominating Orison Blunt. Gunther was elected,\r\nreceiving 29,121 votes, to 22,579 for Boole, and 19,383 for Blunt. At\r\nthis, as in previous elections, there were unmistakable Wigwam frauds,\r\nsuch as repeating and altering election returns.\r\n\r\nHitherto, in Presidential conventions since Van Buren’s time,\r\nthe Democratic candidates had been nominated against Tammany’s\r\nresistance, the organization having had each time a candidate of its\r\nown whom it sought to force on the convention. In 1864, however, the\r\nWigwam shrewdly anticipated the action of the Chicago convention by\r\nrecommending McClellan as the Democratic nominee. On the night of\r\nMcClellan’s nomination, Tammany held a ratification meeting in the City\r\nHall Park, denounced “the imbecility of the administration of Abraham\r\nLincoln” in the conduct of the war and “its ruinous financial policy,”\r\nand declared that it had “forfeited the confidence of the loyal States;\r\nusurped powers not granted by the Constitution; endeavored to render\r\nthe executive, aided by the military, superior to the judicial and\r\nlegislative branches of the Government, and assumed to destroy life and\r\nconfiscate property by its unconstitutional proclamations.” Again, on\r\nNovember 16, at a meeting of the general committee, George H. Purser,\r\na lobbyist and organization leader, offered a resolution, which was\r\nunanimously approved, practically declaring the war a failure.\r\n\r\nIn this election the Republicans took precautions to prevent repetition\r\nof the frauds of preceding years. An investigation disclosed illegal\r\nregistration on a large scale. To hold the lawless in check, Gen.\r\nBenjamin F. Butler was ordered to New York. He brought 6,000 of his own\r\ntroops, with artillery and a regiment of regulars, which he kept within\r\ncall outside of the city until after the election, and he established\r\na civilian system of surveillance in every election district. An\r\nunusually orderly election was the result, though fraud was not\r\nentirely suppressed, and it was charged that both sides were parties to\r\nit. McClellan received a majority in the city of 37,023, of the total\r\nvote of 110,433.\r\n\r\nIn 1865 Tammany again nominated Francis I. A. Boole for Mayor. Boole,\r\nas City Inspector, was the head of a department which embraced the\r\nStreet Cleaning and Health Bureaus. Daniel B. Badger testified before\r\nthe Senate Investigating Committee of 1865 that in the previous year\r\nhe had put in a written bid to clean the streets for $300,000, but when\r\nit was opened, Boole announced loudly that it was $500,000, and gave\r\nthe contract elsewhere, with the consequence that it cost $800,000 to\r\nclean the streets in 1864.[16] Many witnesses swore that they paid\r\nvarious sums, ranging about $200 each, for positions under Boole, only\r\nto be suddenly dismissed later.[17] A surprising number of men were on\r\nBoole’s payrolls who had other business and who appeared only to draw\r\ntheir salaries.[18] The filthy condition of the city entailed a fearful\r\nsacrifice of life, the average deaths yearly being no less than 33 in\r\n1,000.[19] Nearly all the 220 Health Wardens and special inspectors\r\nunder Boole were illiterate and unfit. One of them testified that he\r\nthought “the term ‘hygienic’ meant the odor arising from stagnant\r\nwater.”[20]\r\n\r\nBoole, about this time, was engaged in other activities than the\r\nprotection of the city’s health. In a suit brought by William Elmer\r\nagainst Robert Milbank in the Superior Court, in 1867, Milbank\r\ntestified that he had called upon Boole to learn how he could secure\r\nthe passage of an ordinance allowing the People’s Gas Light Company to\r\nlay pipes in the streets. Boole referred him to Charles E. Loew,[21]\r\na clerk in the Common Council, and later County Clerk, and a noted\r\nTammany figure. Milbank gave Loew $20,000 cash[22] and $30,000 in\r\nstock, whereupon the Common Council passed the ordinance on the same\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nPublic criticism was so caustic that Tammany withdrew Boole and\r\nnominated John T. Hoffman, a man of some popularity and considerable\r\nability. The Mozart faction nominated John Hecker, a religious and\r\npolitical enthusiast of narrow views, but acceptable to the Mozart\r\n“boys” or “strikers,” because of his willingness to supply an abundance\r\nof money. Smith Ely, Jr., urged Hecker to withdraw, as his candidacy\r\nwas hopeless. “Mr. Ely,” said Hecker, “you form your opinions in\r\nthe ordinary way of a business man and politician, but I receive my\r\nimpressions directly from on High.” The Republicans nominated Marshall\r\nO. Roberts, and the “McKeon Democracy” renominated Gunther.\r\n\r\nFrauds were as common as ever. It was well established that 15,000\r\npersons who had registered could not be found at the places given as\r\ntheir residences. In the disreputable districts, upon which Tammany\r\ndepended for a large vote, a non-Tammany speaker was in actual danger\r\nof his life. Hoffman received 32,820 votes; Roberts, 31,657; Hecker,\r\n10,390, and Gunther, 6,758.\r\n\r\nThere is little to say of Hoffman’s administration. Frauds and thefts\r\nof every description continued as before, though it is not possible to\r\nconnect his name with any of them. His popularity grew. The Tammany\r\nSociety elected him Grand Sachem, the Democratic State Committee named\r\nhim for Governor in 1866,[23] and toward the end of his term as Mayor\r\nhe was renominated for that office. Fernando Wood again came forth\r\nas the Mozart Hall nominee, and the Republicans selected William\r\nA. Darling. Hoffman swept everything before him (December, 1867),\r\nreceiving 63,061 votes, to 22,837 for Wood, and 18,483 for Darling.\r\n\r\nThe total vote was 104,481, an increase of 22,779 in two years. The\r\nreasons for this astounding augmentation were no secret to any one.\r\nRepeating was one cause, and false registration was another; in\r\none ward alone--the Eighteenth--in this election, 1,500 fraudulent\r\nregistrations were discovered. But the main cause was illegal\r\nnaturalization. In the Supreme Court and the Court of Common Pleas,\r\ncitizens were turned out at the rate, often, of about 1,000 a day.\r\nThe State census of 1865 gave the city 51,500 native and 77,475\r\nnaturalized voters.[24] The figures were doubtless false, probably\r\nhaving been swelled to allow fraudulent totals at the polls to come\r\nwithin the limits of an officially declared total of eligible voters.\r\nNevertheless, the figures are significant of the proportion of aliens\r\nto natives. The predominance of the former, moreover, was daily made\r\ngreater through the connivance of corrupt Judges with the frauds of\r\nthe politicians. The bulk of these aliens added to the hopelessness of\r\nthe local situation. With their European ideas and training, and their\r\nignorance of our political problems, they became the easy prey of the\r\nward “bosses” and aided in imposing upon the city a reign of unexampled\r\ncorruption.\r\n\r\nHeretofore the Tammany organization had been held in the control of\r\nconstantly changing combinations. Duumvirates, triumvirates and cliques\r\nof various numbers of men had risen, prospered and passed away. The\r\nperiod is now reached when the power became centralized in one man.\r\nFernando Wood had illustrated the feasibility of the “boss” system;\r\nWilliam M. Tweed now appeared to develop it to its highest pitch. The\r\n“boss” was the natural result of the recognized political methods.\r\nWhere, as in previous times, three or four or half a dozen leaders\r\nhad put their wits together and dictated and sold nominations, Tweed,\r\nastute, unprincipled and thoroughly versed in the most subterranean\r\nphases of ward politics, now gathered this power exclusively in his own\r\nhands. How he and his followers used it was disclosed in the operations\r\nof the extraordinary Tweed, or Tammany “Ring.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Statement to the author by Douglas Taylor, then his private\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\n[2] Fowler was an exception to the average run of the leaders who\r\npreceded him, in that he was a college graduate and moved in the best\r\nsocial circles.

The Whigs, and their successors,\r\nthe Republicans, had up to that year held the legislative power of\r\nthe State for the greater part of ten years, during which their chief\r\nconcern had been the devising of means for keeping down the Democratic\r\nmajority in New York City. Their legislation was directed to the\r\ntransferring of as much as they could of the government of the city to\r\nState officials, a change generally welcomed by the honest part of the\r\ncitizenship, on account of the continuous misgovernment inflicted by\r\ncity officials.\r\n\r\nThe real result of these transfers, however, was merely to make\r\ntwo strongholds of corruption instead of one. The Republican power\r\nin Albany and the Tammany power in New York City found it to their\r\ninterests to arrange terms for the distribution of patronage and\r\nbooty. Accordingly, as one means to that end, the Board of Supervisors\r\nfor New York County was created. It was founded strictly as a State\r\ninstitution. Unlike the Boards of Supervisors of other counties, it had\r\nno power to tax. It could only ascertain and levy the taxes decreed\r\nby the State Legislature, which was required to pass yearly a special\r\nact declaring the amount necessary for the maintenance of the city\r\ngovernment. It was to be an elective body, and each side was to have an\r\nequal quota of the twelve members. But in the first board convened,\r\nthis delicate balance was upset, as has been shown, by the buying of a\r\nRepublican member, which in effect gave Tammany a majority.\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Tweed was born in Cherry street in 1823. He spent the\r\nusual life of a New York boy. His father was a chairmaker in good\r\ncircumstances and gave his children a fair education. Fascinated, as\r\nwere most New York boys of the period, with the life of a volunteer\r\nfireman, he became a runner with Engine 12 before he was of age, and\r\nin 1849 he was elected foreman of another fire company. Carrying a\r\nsilver-mounted trumpet, a white fire-coat over his arm and wearing an\r\nold-fashioned stiff hat, he led the ropes. So popular was young Tweed\r\nthat he became a powerful factor in ward politics, and gifted with\r\nthe qualities that counted most in those circles, he was not slow in\r\nutilizing his popularity. The Americus Club, for a long time Tweed’s\r\nfavorite quarters, and at times the place where Tammany politics were\r\ndetermined, was started with him as its foremost luminary.\r\n\r\nThough defeated for Assistant Alderman in 1850, he was elected the next\r\nyear and served in the “Forty Thieves” Board. He was a delegate, in\r\n1852, to the Congressional convention of the Fifth District, composed\r\nof two East Side wards of New York City, and Williamsburg. A deadlock\r\nensued, through each of two candidates polling forty-four votes.\r\nFinally the Williamsburg delegates “threw over” their favorite and\r\nvoted for Tweed, who as chairman of the convention, cast the deciding\r\nvote for himself, with the statement that “Tweedie never goes back on\r\nTweedie.” He was elected, but beaten for reelection, in 1854, by the\r\n“Know-Nothings.” The latter he fought so persistently that he became\r\nknown as the champion of the foreign element. He was made a Sachem of\r\nthe Tammany Society because of his extreme popularity, and in 1857\r\nhe was elected to the Board of Supervisors. Selling his business of\r\nchairmaking, he thereupon devoted his entire time to politics.\r\n\r\nThe first “ring” was the Supervisors’ “Ring,” founded in 1859 by the\r\nDemocrats in the board for the purpose of procuring the appointment of\r\nInspectors of Election.[1] One member of the board, as already shown,\r\nwas bribed by a present of $2,500 to stay away from a session when the\r\nInspectors were appointed. Tweed was so well pleased with the success\r\nof this scheme that he was inspired to wider efforts. Aided by two\r\nmen--Walter Roche and John R. Briggs--he began a systematic course of\r\nlobbying before the Board of Aldermen in support of excessive bills\r\nfor supplies. He and his associates collected heavy tribute on every\r\nsuccessful bill.\r\n\r\nHis prestige was not visibly lessened by his defeat for Sheriff, in\r\n1861, by James Lynch, a popular Irishman. In the same year he was\r\nelected chairman of the Tammany General Committee. This instantly made\r\nhim a person of great political importance. But his grasp was yet\r\ninsecure, since a hostile body of Sachems might at any time declare\r\nthe general committee “irregular.” Recognizing this, he planned to\r\ndominate the society by having himself elected Grand Sachem. Holding\r\nthese two positions, he reckoned that his power would be absolute.\r\nFor the time, however, he thought it wise to be satisfied with the\r\none; but eventually he succeeded Hoffman as Grand Sachem, and in his\r\ndual positions gained complete control of the political situation and\r\ndictated nominations at will.\r\n\r\nThe title of “boss” he earned by his despotic action in the general\r\ncommittee. When a question was to be voted upon which he wished to have\r\ndetermined in his favor, he would neglect to call for negative votes\r\nand would decide in the affirmative, with a significantly admonishing\r\nglance at the opposing side. Soon friends and enemies alike called him\r\n“Boss” Tweed, and he did not seem to take the title harshly.\r\n\r\nHe made short shrift of his antagonists. Once, when chairman of\r\na Tammany nominating convention, he declared the nomination of\r\nMichael Ulshoeffer, for Judge, unanimous, amid a storm of protests.\r\nOn adjournment, thirty delegates remained behind to make a\r\ncounter-nomination. Tweed blocked their plan by having the gas turned\r\noff.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile he daily increased his strong personal following. Nominally\r\nDeputy Street Commissioner, to which place he was appointed in 1863, he\r\nwas virtually the head of that department, and could employ, when so\r\ninclined, thousands of laborers, who could be used in manipulating ward\r\nprimaries when the ward leaders showed a spirit of revolt. The Aldermen\r\nhad to apply to him for jobs for their ward supporters. As a member\r\nof the Board of Supervisors at the same time, he was in a position to\r\nexercise his mandatory influence respecting the passage of resolutions\r\ndealing with expenditures and the giving out of contracts. In 1868 he\r\nadded a third office to the list--that of State Senator, and was thus\r\nenabled to superintend personally the “running” of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe members of the “ring”--Tweed and his subordinates, Peter B. Sweeny,\r\nRichard B. Connolly and the rest--were growing rich at a rapid rate.\r\nAccording to the subsequent testimony of James H. Ingersoll, it was\r\nin 1867 that the understanding was reached that persons who supplied\r\nthe public offices with materials would be required to increase the\r\npercentages given to the officials, and that all purveyors to the city\r\nmust comply. The previous tax had been but 10 per cent., and it had\r\nbeen somewhat irregularly levied. A few tradesmen refused to pay the\r\nadvance, but plenty there were to take their places. Ingersoll was one\r\nof these. He was told to fix his bills so as to “put up 35 per cent.,”\r\nand he obligingly complied with the command. Of the 35 per cent.\r\ncollected, 25 went to Tweed and 10 to Controller Connolly.\r\n\r\nTweed had become dissatisfied with the old Tammany Hall building, and\r\na site for a new hall--the present location on Fourteenth street--was\r\nsecured. The funds in hand for the building were insufficient,\r\nhowever, and had to be augmented by private subscription. It well\r\nillustrates the liberality with which the Tammany chieftains were\r\nsupplying themselves financially, to note that when John Kelly, the\r\nGrand Sachem, at a meeting of the society announced that a loan of\r\n$250,000 would be needed, the sum of $175,000 was subscribed on the\r\nspot, fifteen members alone subscribing $10,000 each.[2] A far more\r\nastonishing incident happened in the Fall of 1867, when Peter B.\r\nSweeny, the City Chamberlain,[3] announced his determination to give to\r\nthe city treasury, for the benefit of the taxpayers, over $200,000 a\r\nyear, interest money, which before that had been pocketed by the City\r\nChamberlain.\r\n\r\nWhile the “ring” was plundering the city and plotting theft on a more\r\ngigantic scale, the Sachems, many of them implicated in the frauds,\r\nlaid the corner-stone of the new Tammany Hall building. The ceremony\r\nwas marked by the characteristic pronouncement of virtuous-sounding\r\nphrases. “Brothers and friends,” rhapsodized Mayor Hoffman, “in the\r\nname of the Tammany Society, I proceed to lay the corner-stone of\r\na new hall which will, for the next half century at least, be the\r\nheadquarters of the Democracy of New York, where the great principles\r\nof civil and religious liberty, constitutional law and national unity,\r\nwhich form the great corner-stones of the republic, will always be\r\nadvocated and maintained.…” The “braves” then marched to Irving Hall,\r\nwhere Tweed, Sweeny and Connolly had caused such inscriptions as these\r\nto be hung about: “Civil liberty the glory of man”; “The Democratic\r\nparty--Upon its union and success depends the future of the republic.\r\nHe who would seek to lower its standard of patriotism and principle, or\r\ndistract its councils, is an enemy to the country.” Gazing approvingly\r\non these inscriptions from the platform sat Tweed, Sweeny and Connolly,\r\nA. Oakey Hall and a host of Judges and office-holders of all sorts,\r\nwhile Andrew J. Garvey (who will reappear in these chapters) conducted\r\nthe invited guests. The building of this hall--an imposing one for the\r\nday--in a central part of the city, gave to the Tweed combination an\r\nadvantage of no inconsiderable significance.\r\n\r\nIn the new Wigwam, on July 4, 1868, the Democratic national convention\r\nwas held. Tammany, in fact, forced its candidate, Horatio Seymour,\r\non the convention. The galleries were filled with seasoned Wigwam\r\nshouters, cheering vociferously for Seymour. Only persons having\r\ntickets were admitted, and these tickets were distributed by an able\r\nyoung Wigwam politician, who saw to it that only the right sort of\r\npersons gained entrance. Gaining its point on the nomination, Tammany\r\nmagnanimously allowed the Southern men to dictate the declaration in\r\nthe platform that the reconstruction acts were “unconstitutional,\r\nrevolutionary and void.” There was a general suspicion that the\r\norganization, hopeless of the election of a Democratic President, had\r\nforced Seymour’s nomination for the purpose of trading votes for its\r\nState and local ticket.\r\n\r\nThe State convention again named Hoffman for Governor, and\r\npreparations began for a lively campaign. Tammany addressed itself\r\nto the citizenship as the defender of the interests of the poor, and\r\ninstanced the candidacy of John A. Griswold for Governor, Edwin D.\r\nMorgan for Governor, and “several other millionaires,” as a proof of\r\nthe plutocratic tendencies of the Republican party. On October 19 the\r\ngeneral committee, with Tweed in the chair, adopted an address urging\r\nthe people to stand by Seymour and Blair. Continuing, it said:\r\n\r\n    “We are united. We believe in our cause. It is the cause of\r\n    constitutional liberty, of personal rights, of a fraternity of\r\n    States, of an economical government, of the financial credit\r\n    of the nation, of one currency for all men, rich and poor, and\r\n    of the political supremacy of the white race and protection\r\n    of American labor.… [Hoffman] is the friend of the poor, the\r\n    sympathizer with the naturalized citizen, and the foe to\r\n    municipal oppression in the form of odious excise and all other\r\n    requisitional laws.… Is not the pending contest preeminently\r\n    one of capital against labor, of money against popular rights,\r\n    and of political power against the struggling interests of the\r\n    masses?”\r\n\r\nPublic addresses and pronunciamentos, however, formed but a small part\r\nof the Tammany program for 1868. For six weeks the naturalization mills\r\nworked with the greatest regularity in the Supreme, Common Pleas and\r\nSuperior Courts, producing, it was estimated, from 25,000 to 30,000\r\ncitizens, of whom not less than 85 per cent. voted the Tammany Hall\r\nticket. On October 30 Tweed announced to the general committee that\r\n“at 10 o’clock to-morrow the money for electioneering purposes will\r\nbe distributed” and that those who came first would be served first.\r\nThe chairman of the executive committee spread forth the glad tidings\r\nthat there was $1,000 ready for each election district. There being\r\n327 election districts, this made a fund of $327,000 from the general\r\ncommittee alone, exclusive of the sums derived in the districts\r\nthemselves from the saloon-keepers and the tradesmen, whose fear of\r\ninviting reprisals by Tammany officials made them “easy marks” for\r\nassessments. Tweed personally suggested to the twenty-four leaders the\r\nstuffing of ballot boxes.[4] By fraudulent naturalization, repeating,\r\nthe buying and trading of votes, and intimidation, Seymour secured\r\na total of 108,316 votes, against 47,762 for Grant. The whole vote\r\nof the city was swelled to 156,288, of which, it was conclusively\r\ndemonstrated, at least 25,000 were fraudulent.[5] Tweed himself\r\nconfessed, nine years later, that he thought the Inspectors of\r\nElections “lumped” the votes and declared them without counting, in\r\norder to overcome the result in the rest of the State and give the\r\nelectoral vote to Seymour.[6] To prevent the Republicans from getting\r\nthe use of certain telegraph wires on election night, Tweed sent out\r\nlong, useless messages, and it was even proposed to telegraph the whole\r\nBible if necessary.[7]\r\n\r\nHoffman was swept into the Governorship on the strength of the frauds.\r\nHis election left vacant the Mayor’s chair, and a special election to\r\nfill it was called for the first Tuesday of December.\r\n\r\nIt was all essential to the “ring” that its candidate, A. Oakey\r\nHall, should be elected. The candidacy of Frederick A. Conkling, the\r\nRepublican nominee, was not feared, but John Kelly, who controlled\r\na considerable part of the Irish vote, was a threatening factor.\r\nDisappointed at not receiving a new post at the close of his term\r\nas Sheriff, he had led a revolt against the “ring,” and had himself\r\nnominated for Mayor at the Masonic Hall “reform” convention.\r\n“Influences” were soon set at work; and suddenly, after Kelly had\r\nappeared before the nominating convention and accepted the nomination,\r\nhe withdrew from the contest, on the score of ill-health.[8] Hall\r\nwon, receiving 75,109 votes, to 20,835 for Conkling. The degree in\r\nwhich Tammany fraudulently increased the vote at the November election\r\nis indicated in the fact that at the December election, despite a\r\nrepetition of frauds, the Tammany vote declined 33,000.\r\n\r\nThe “ring” nominations, being equivalent to election, yielded a\r\nlarge price. There was no Democratic opposition, Mozart Hall having\r\npractically passed out of existence, through Wood’s resignation of its\r\nleadership. The revenues of the various city offices were constantly\r\nrising, and a keener competition for the places arose. In 1866, before\r\nthe really extensive operations of the “ring” began, it was estimated\r\nthat the offices of Sheriff and County Clerk were worth $40,000 a year\r\neach. Several years later it was found that the yearly revenue of the\r\nRegister amounted to between $60,000 and $70,000, partly derived from\r\nillegal fees. It was well known that one Register had received the sum\r\nof $80,000 a year.[9] The yearly aggregate of the illegal transactions\r\nin the Sheriff’s office could not be accurately ascertained; but it\r\nwas a well-authenticated fact that one Sheriff, about 1870, drew from\r\nthe office the sum of $150,000 the first year of his term. He was a\r\npoor man when elected; upon retiring at the end of the two-years’ term,\r\nhe did not conceal the fact that he was worth $250,000, clear of all\r\npolitical assessments and other deductions.\r\n\r\nAll nominations for city, county and, too often, State offices, and\r\nnotoriously those for Judges, were dictated by Tweed. He not only\r\ncontrolled all the local departments, but swayed every court below\r\nthe Court of Appeals.[10] Judges were nominated partly with a view\r\nto the amount they could “put up,” and partly with a view to their\r\nfuture decisions on political questions. Fernando Wood had frankly\r\npresented the latter reason in his speech nominating Albert Cardozo,\r\none of Tweed’s most useful puppets, for the Supreme Court.[11] At\r\nthe Judiciary election of May, 1870, repeating was the order of the\r\nday, and the registry was swelled to an enormous extent. In one of\r\nthe wards, about 1,100 negroes were registered; but when they went to\r\nthe ballot boxes, they were amazed to learn that white repeaters had\r\nalready voted upon nearly 500 of their names. Later, when a few of the\r\nnegroes tried to vote, they were arrested as repeaters. The corrupt\r\nmeans used in selecting the Judiciary, and the hopelessness of securing\r\njust verdicts in any of the courts, prompted one writer seriously\r\nto discuss, in the pages of a standard magazine, the formation of a\r\nvigilance committee modeled upon that of San Francisco.[12]\r\n\r\nTweed had for some time recognized the importance of gaining a seat\r\nin the State Senate. That body could at any time create or abolish\r\ncity departments or offices, or change the laws affecting them. The\r\nTammany officials, realizing its potentialities, had already made\r\nterms with it, and the “ring,” which subsisted at first between the\r\ntwo factions of partizans in the Board of Supervisors, had grown into\r\na compact “ring” between the Republican majority at Albany, the Board\r\nof Supervisors and the Democratic officials of New York City. Tweed\r\nsaw the necessity of being at the center of political bargaining and\r\nlegislative manipulation, and accordingly had himself elected to the\r\nupper house.\r\n\r\nUpon taking his seat, in 1868, he at once began to procure legislation\r\nincreasing his power in New York City. His first measure was the\r\n“Adjusted Claims” act, which gave the City Controller power to adjust\r\nclaims then existing against the city, and to obtain money by the issue\r\nof bonds. Payments under this act were first made by the Controller\r\nin July, 1868, and were continued to January, 1869. During this time,\r\n55 per cent. of the claims paid were divided among the members of the\r\n“ring.” In July, 1869, payments under the act were resumed, but the\r\npercentage was increased to 60 per cent., and after November, 1869, to\r\n65 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe conspiring contractors were led by Andrew J. Garvey, Ingersoll\r\n& Co. and Keyser & Co. At first, 25 per cent. of the spoils went to\r\nTweed, 20 to Connolly and 10 to Sweeny. When the rate was subsequently\r\nincreased, others were permitted to share in the harvest, and Watson,\r\nthe County Auditor; Woodward, the clerk of the Board of Supervisors,\r\nand the recognized go-betweens for the “ring” members, received 2½ per\r\ncent. Five per cent. was reserved for “expenses”--in other words, the\r\nsums necessary to bribe the requisite members of the Legislature. The\r\ndivision of the spoils was a matter of daily occurrence when Tweed was\r\nin town, and took place in the Supervisors’ room in the County Court\r\nHouse. After Watson’s warrants had been cashed, Garvey would carry\r\nTweed’s share of the plunder to the “Boss” at the office of Street\r\nCommissioner George W. McLean. On one such visit Garvey found McLean\r\npresent. In trying to hand the parcel secretly to Tweed, it fell on\r\nthe floor. Tweed quickly covered it with his foot, and later, with\r\napparent carelessness, picked it up and threw it into a drawer. The\r\ntoo-ingenious Garvey was thereafter instructed to “do business” with\r\nWoodward.[13]\r\n\r\nTweed soon reached a position of general control in the State\r\nLegislature. But it cost him hundreds of thousands of dollars. Often he\r\nhad to pay for what he wanted quite as heavily as did the corporations\r\nwho maintained lobbies there. “It was impossible to do anything there\r\nwithout paying for it,” were his own words; “money had to be raised\r\nfor the passing of bills.”[14] A well-known lobbyist of the time\r\nstated that for a favorable report on a certain bill before the Senate\r\n$5,000 apiece was paid to four members of the committee having it\r\nin charge. On the passage of the bill a further $5,000 apiece, with\r\ncontingent expenses, was to be paid. In another instance, when but one\r\nvote was needed to pass a bill, three Republicans put their figures\r\nup to $25,000 each. One of them, it is needless to say, was secured.\r\nA band of about thirty Republicans and Democrats, shortly afterwards\r\nbecoming known as the “Black Horse Cavalry,” organized themselves\r\nunder the leadership of an energetic lobbyist, with a mutual pledge to\r\nvote as directed.[15] Naturally their action exercised a strong “bull”\r\ninfluence on the market for votes; and the sums paid by Tweed and other\r\n“promoters” grew to an enormous aggregate.\r\n\r\nHonesty among legislators was at a discount. There were some honest\r\nmen in both houses who voted for several of the bills alluded to, on\r\ntheir merits. The lobbyists entered these men in their memoranda to\r\ntheir corporations as having been “fixed,” put the money in their\r\nown pockets and allowed the honest members to suffer under the\r\nimputation of having been bribed. Any corporation, however extensive\r\nand comprehensive the privileges it asked, and however much oppression\r\nit sought to impose upon the people in the line of unjust grants,\r\nextortionate rates or monopoly, could convince the Legislature of the\r\nrighteousness of its requests upon “producing the proper sum.”[16] The\r\ntestimony before the Select Committee of the New York Senate, appointed\r\nApril 10, 1868, showed that at least $500,000 was expended to get\r\nlegislation legalizing fraudulent Erie Railway stock issues.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the “ring” opened operations in the Legislature and in\r\nthe municipal bodies on a greater scale than ever. Tweed began to\r\nconcern himself in Erie and other railroads, and to compel different\r\ncorporations to give tribute for laws passed in their interest or\r\nfor providing against hostile measures. He ordered the passage of\r\nthe Erie Classification bill, at the suggestion of “Jim” Fisk, Jr.,\r\nand Jay Gould, who for that service made him a director of the\r\nErie railroad.[17] At this juncture Fisk and Gould were engaged in\r\ngreat stock frauds and in breeding a disastrous panic, which caused\r\nwidespread ruin and suffering. Tweed abetted their schemes. One of his\r\nmost servile tools, Judge George G. Barnard, of the Supreme Court, did\r\nwhatever Tweed directed him, especially in favor of Gould and Fisk. One\r\nbiographer of Fisk wrote quite innocently: “Jay Gould and Fisk took\r\nWilliam M. Tweed into their [Erie] board, and the State Legislature,\r\nTammany Hall and the Erie ‘Ring’ were fused in interest and have\r\ncontrived to serve each other faithfully.”[18] Once Tweed complained\r\nthat a friend “had gone back on him,” and when asked in return how it\r\nwas that he could stand such drains on his check-book, he laughed and\r\nshowed a slip of paper on which he had calculated his Erie profits for\r\nthe foregoing three months; they amounted to $650,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1869, for the election of members of the\r\nCommon Council and certain State officers, a legal question arose\r\nas to whether Mayor Hall had been elected for two years or merely\r\nfor the unexpired year of Hoffman’s term. Hall claimed a two-years’\r\nterm, and the best lawyers supported the claim. But to make sure of\r\nthe matter, Tammany, in the late days of the campaign, instructed\r\nits members and followers to cast ballots for him, and the Police\r\nCommissioners distributed special ballot boxes for the Mayoralty vote.\r\nAs no proclamation on the subject had been issued, the Republicans and\r\nother opponents of Tammany Hall had no opportunity to make nominations.\r\nMayor Hall consequently received nearly the entire number of votes\r\ncast--65,568, out of a total of 66,619.\r\n\r\nAfter entering the Board of Supervisors, Tweed had boasted that he\r\nwould soon be among the largest real-estate owners in the city. He made\r\ngood the boast. A comparatively poor man in 1864, he was reputed five\r\nyears later to be worth $12,000,000. This was an exaggeration, for\r\nhe was not worth anything like that sum at any one time; but he was,\r\nnevertheless, an enormously rich man. He had investments in real estate\r\nand iron mines; he was interested in every street opening and widening\r\nscheme; he had a hand in all city, and in some State, contracts, and\r\nhe held directorships in many railroad and gas companies and other\r\ncorporations. Connolly, who some years before had left a position\r\nas a book-keeper, at a moderate salary, to engage in politics “as a\r\nfinancial speculation”; Sweeny, and the rest of the “ring,” suddenly\r\nbecame millionaires. Many other politicians shared in the sacking of\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Documents of the Board of Aldermen_, 1877, part 2, No. 8, pp.\r\n15-16. This document, embodying the full confession of Tweed before\r\na special investigating committee, will be frequently referred to in\r\nthis and the following chapter. Its value as a support to many of the\r\nstatements made in the text of this work rests upon the credibility\r\nof Tweed’s word. The best opinion is that Tweed told the approximate\r\ntruth. He was not a vengeful man; he was, at the time, old, and broken\r\nin power and health; he had no reason for concealment or evasion, and\r\nit is unlikely, considering his moral temperament, that he would have\r\nmade false statements for the purpose of involving innocent men, or of\r\nadding to the sum of venality already proved against the guilty.\r\n\r\n[2] New York _Herald_, September 10, 1867.\r\n\r\n[3] “I heard that Peter B.

They were led by Henry W. Genet, John Fox,\r\nJohn Morrissey, James O’Brien, “Mike” Norton and others, and called\r\nthemselves the “Young Democracy.” Tweed had used these men in building\r\nhis power; now, combined, they believed they could retire him. The\r\ndangerous classes joined them. Heretofore, these had stood by Tweed\r\nunder a reciprocal agreement valuable to both sides. But the “Boss”\r\nhad recently yielded to the public indignation over the leniency shown\r\nto an influential murderer, and had given orders to the Judges to\r\ndeal more severely with flagrant criminal cases. This act constituted\r\na virtual breaking of the compact, and the lawbreakers with one\r\naccord turned against him. There were at this time in the city,\r\nit was charged, about 30,000 professional thieves, 2,000 gambling\r\nestablishments and 3,000 saloons.[1]\r\n\r\nThe plan of the Young Democracy leaders was to induce the Legislature\r\nto pass a measure known as the Huckleberry charter, the object of which\r\nwas to abolish the State commissions governing the city and to obtain\r\na relegation of their powers to the Board of Aldermen. The disclosure\r\nwas made, many years later, that Richard Croker and seven other members\r\nof the Board of Aldermen had signed an agreement before a notary\r\npublic, on March 20, 1870, pledging themselves to take no official\r\naction on any proposition affecting the city government without first\r\nobtaining the consent of Senator Genet and four other Young Democracy\r\nleaders.[2] These latter boasted that they would “put the charter\r\nthrough” if it took $200,000 to do it. To save himself, Tweed opened a\r\nhalf-way understanding with the Young Democracy chiefs, by which he was\r\nto join them and abandon Sweeny. Tweed even offered--though vainly--one\r\nof the most formidable young leaders $200,000 outright if he would\r\nswerve the Young Democracy to his interest.\r\n\r\nThe Young Democracy succeeded in winning over a majority of the general\r\ncommittee, and influenced that majority to call a meeting to be held in\r\nthe Wigwam, on March 28. But the plotters had overlooked the society,\r\nwhose Sachems, being either in, or subservient to, the “ring,” now\r\nexercised the oft-used expedient of shutting out of the hall such\r\npersons as happened to be obnoxious to them. When the members of the\r\ngeneral committee appeared before Tammany Hall, on the night of March\r\n28, they found to their surprise that the “ring” had caused to be\r\nplaced a guard of 600 policemen about the building, to prevent their\r\ningress. The gathering convened in Irving Hall, nearby, where by roll\r\ncall it was found that 187 members of the committee, later increased\r\nby about a dozen--a clear majority of the whole number--were present.\r\nFiery speeches were made, and the set purpose of dethroning and\r\nrepudiating the “ring” Sachems was emphatically declared.\r\n\r\nBut the Young Democracy failed to distribute among the members of\r\nthe Legislature the sum promised, and the country members, by way of\r\nrevenge, voted down the Huckleberry charter. Greatly encouraged by\r\nhis enemies’ defeat, the “Boss” went to Albany with a vast sum of\r\nmoney and the draft of a new charter. This charter, supplemented by a\r\nnumber of amendments which Tweed subsequently caused the Legislature to\r\npass, virtually relieved the “ring” of accountability to anybody. The\r\nState commissions were abolished, and practically the whole municipal\r\npower was placed in the hands of a Board of Special Audit, composed\r\nof himself, Connolly and Mayor Hall. No money could be drawn from the\r\ncity without the permission of this board. The powers of the Board of\r\nAldermen, moreover, were virtually abolished.[3]\r\n\r\nThe charter, which immediately became known as the “Tweed charter,”\r\nwas passed on April 5. The victory cost every dollar of the sum Tweed\r\ntook with him. Samuel J. Tilden testified that it was popularly\r\nsupposed that about $1,000,000 was the amount used.[4] Tweed stated\r\nthat he gave to one man $600,000 with which to buy votes, this being\r\nmerely a part of the fund. For his services this lobbyist received a\r\nposition requiring little or no work and worth from $10,000 to $15,000\r\na year.[5] Tweed further testified that he bought the votes of five\r\nRepublican Senators for $40,000 apiece, giving one of them $200,000\r\nin cash to distribute.[6] The vote in the two houses was practically\r\nunanimous: in the Senate, 30 to 2, and in the Assembly, 116 to 5. The\r\nstate of the public conscience in New York City may be judged from\r\nthe fact that the charter received the support of nearly all classes,\r\n“large numbers,” according to the Annual Cyclopedia for 1871, “of the\r\nwealthiest citizens signing the petition” [for its passage].\r\n\r\nTweed’s enemies were now crushed. At the election (April 18) of the\r\nSachems of the society the opposition could poll only a paltry 23\r\nvotes, against the 242 secured by Tweed’s candidates; and even this\r\nminority was a factitious one, Tilden declaring that Tweed had arranged\r\nfor it, to furnish the appearance of a contest.\r\n\r\nTweed’s organization was wonderfully effective. The society stood ready\r\nat a moment’s notice to expel from the Wigwam any person or group\r\nobnoxious to him. The general committee was now likewise subservient.\r\nIn every ward he had a reliable representative--a leader, whose duty\r\nwas to see that his particular district should return its expected\r\nmajority. Under the leaders there were sub-leaders, ward clubs and\r\nassociations, and captains of every election district. The organization\r\ncovered every block in town with unceasing vigilance, acquainting\r\nitself with the politics of every voter. The moment a leader lost his\r\npopularity, or hesitated at scruples of any sort, Tweed dismissed\r\nhim; only vote-getters and henchmen were wanted. So large was his\r\npersonal following, that he not only caused thousands to be appointed\r\nto superfluous offices, but had a number of retainers, to whom he paid\r\nin the aggregate probably $60,000 a year, “letting them think they were\r\nbeing paid by the city.”[7] Opposition he had no difficulty in buying\r\noff, as in the case of one “Citizen’s Association,” whose principal men\r\nhe caused to be appointed to various lucrative positions in the city\r\ngovernment.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Registry law having been virtually repealed at Tweed’s order,\r\nelection frauds were made easier, and as a result of the abolition by\r\nthe “Tweed charter” of the December city election, and the merging into\r\none day’s polling of national, State and city elections, the “ring”\r\nwas in a position to resume the old practise of trading candidates, if\r\nall other resources failed.\r\n\r\nWith the passage of the “Tweed charter” and the City and County Tax\r\nLevy bill[9] of 1870, the stealing expanded to a colossal degree. At\r\na single sitting--on May 5, 1870--the Board of Special Audit made out\r\nan order for the payment of $6,312,500 on account in building the new\r\nCounty Court House. Of this sum barely a tenth part was realized by\r\nthe city.[10] From the 65 per cent. levied on supplies, at the end\r\nof 1869, the rate was swelled to 85 per cent. “Jobs” significant of\r\nuntold millions lurked in every possible form. Great projects of public\r\nimprovements were exploited to the last dollar that could be drawn from\r\nthem. A frequent practise of Tweed was to create on paper a fictitious\r\ninstitution, jot down three or four of his friends as officers, put a\r\nlarge amount for that institution in the tax levy and pocket the money.\r\nAsylums, hospitals and dispensaries that were never heard of, and\r\nnever existed except on paper, were put down as beneficiaries of State\r\nand city. The thefts were concealed in the main by means of issues\r\nof stocks and bonds and the creation of a floating debt, which the\r\nController never let appear in his statements.\r\n\r\nA new reform movement appeared during the Summer and Fall of 1870.\r\nRepublicans, independents and disaffected Democrats combined forces and\r\nnominated Thomas A. Ledwith for Mayor. The reform ticket was apparently\r\nreceived with great public approval, and hopes began to be entertained\r\nof its success at the polls. Tweed, however, had already secured, by\r\nways known best to himself, assurance of Republican assistance; he\r\nhad large numbers of Republican officials, Election Inspectors, and\r\nthe like, in his pay, and therefore knew that he had nothing to fear.\r\nBesides this, Tammany was united and enthusiastic. Its candidates,\r\nHall, for Mayor, and Hoffman, for Governor, had seemingly lost none of\r\ntheir popularity with the rank and file. A few days before the election\r\na popular demonstration, perhaps the largest in Tammany’s history, was\r\nheld in and about the Wigwam. August Belmont presided, and addresses\r\nwere made by Seymour, Hoffman, Tweed and Fisk (who had now become a\r\nDemocrat). All the speakers were received with boisterous enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nTweed won, Hall receiving 71,037 votes, to 46,392 for Ledwith. But the\r\nindications were plain that a reaction against the “ring” had begun,\r\nfor Hoffman’s vote exceeded that of Hall by 15,631, while Ledwith’s\r\nvote exceeded that of Stewart L. Woodford, the Republican candidate for\r\nGovernor, by nearly 12,000.\r\n\r\nPartly to quiet his conscience, it was suspected, and in part to make\r\nhimself appear in the light of a generously impulsive man, Tweed gave,\r\nin the Winter of 1870-71, $1,000 to each of the Aldermen of the various\r\nwards to buy coal for the poor. To the needy of his native ward he\r\ngave $50,000. By these acts he succeeded in deluding the needier part\r\nof the population to the enormity of his crimes. Abstractly, these\r\nbeneficiaries of his bounty knew he had not amassed his millions by\r\nhonest means. But when, in the midst of a severe Winter, they were\r\ngladdened by presents of coal and provisions, they did not stop to\r\nmoralize, but blessed the man who could be so good to them. Even\r\npersons beyond the range of his bounty have hailed him as a great\r\nphilanthropist; and the expression, “Well, if Tweed stole, he was at\r\nleast good to the poor,” is still repeated, and furnished, in its tacit\r\nexoneration, the prompting for like conduct, both thieving and giving,\r\non the part of his successors.\r\n\r\nOne of Tweed’s schemes was the Viaduct Railroad bill, which virtually\r\nallowed a company created by himself to place a railroad on or above\r\nthe ground, on any city street. The Legislature passed, and Governor\r\nHoffman signed, the bill, early in 1871. One of its provisions\r\nauthorized and compelled the city to take $5,000,000 of stock;[11]\r\nanother exempted the company’s property from taxes or assessments,\r\nwhile other bills allowed for the benefit of the railroad the widening\r\nand the grading of streets, which meant a “job” costing the city from\r\n$50,000,000 to $65,000,000.[12] Associated with Tweed and others of the\r\n“ring” as directors were some of the foremost financial and business\r\nmen of the day. The complete consummation of this almost unparalleled\r\nsteal was prevented only by the general exposure of Tweedism a few\r\nmonths later.\r\n\r\nIn the Assembly of 1871 party divisions were so even that Tweed,\r\nthough holding a majority of two votes, had only the exact number (65)\r\nrequired by the constitution as a majority. In April “Jimmy” Irving,\r\none of the city Assemblymen, resigned, to avoid being expelled for\r\nhaving assaulted Smith Weed. But Tweed was equal to the occasion,\r\nfor the very next day he obtained the vote and services of Orange S.\r\nWinans, a Republican creature of the Erie Railroad Company. It was\r\ncharged publicly that Tweed gave Winans $75,000 in cash, and that the\r\nErie Railroad Company gave him a five-years’ tenure of office at $5,000\r\na year.[13]\r\n\r\nTweed neglected no means whatever to avert popular criticism. A\r\ncommittee composed of six of the leading and richest citizens--Moses\r\nTaylor, Marshall O. Roberts, E. D. Brown, J. J. Astor, George K.\r\nSistare and Edward Schell--were induced to make an examination of the\r\nController’s books, and hand in a most eulogistic report, commending\r\nConnolly for his honesty and faithfulness to duty. So highly useful a\r\ndocument naturally was used for all it was worth.[14]\r\n\r\nBut it was in his tender providence over the newspapers that his\r\ngreatest success in averting public clamor was shown. Both in Albany\r\nand in this city he showered largess upon the press. One paper at the\r\nCapital received, through his efforts, a legislative appropriation of\r\n$207,900 for one year’s printing, whereas $10,000 would have overpaid\r\nit for the service rendered.[15] The proprietor of an Albany journal\r\nwhich was for many years the Republican organ of the State, made it a\r\npractice to submit to Tweed’s personal censorship the most violently\r\nabusive articles. On the payment of large sums, sometimes as much as\r\n$5,000, Tweed was permitted to make such alterations as he chose.[16]\r\nHere, in the city, the owner of one subservient newspaper received\r\n$80,000 a year for “city advertising,” and to some other newspapers\r\nlarge subsidies were paid in the same guise. Under the head of “city\r\ncontingencies,” reporters for the city newspapers, Democratic and\r\nRepublican, received Christmas presents of $200 each. This particular\r\npractice had begun before Tweed’s time,[17] but in line with the\r\nexpansive manner of the “ring,” the plan was elaborated by subsidizing\r\nsix or eight men on nearly all the city newspapers, crediting each of\r\nthem with $2,000 or $2,500 a year for “services.”[18]\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the _Sun_, a newspaper that, from supporting the\r\nYoung Democracy, veered suddenly to an enthusiastic devotion to the\r\n“Boss,” proposed, in March 1871, the erection of a statue to Tweed.\r\nThe “Boss’s” adherents jumped at the idea; and an association for the\r\npurpose was formed by Edward J. Shandley, a Police Justice, and a host\r\nof other men of local note, in professional, political and social\r\ncircles, among whom were not only ardent friends of Tweed, but also\r\nthose who, having opposed him, sought this opportunity of ingratiating\r\nthemselves into his favor. The statue was to be “in commemoration of\r\nhis [Tweed’s] services to the commonwealth of New York”--so ran the\r\ncircular letter.\r\n\r\nIn a few days the association had obtained nearly $8,000, some\r\npoliticians giving $1,000 apiece. Other men pledged themselves to pay\r\nany amount from $1,000 to $10,000, and were on the point of making good\r\ntheir word when a letter from Tweed appeared, discountenancing the\r\nproject. It was printed in the Sun of March 14, 1871, under the heading:\r\n\r\n    “A GREAT MAN’S MODESTY.\r\n\r\n    “THE HON. WILLIAM M. TWEED DECLINES THE SUN’S\r\n    STATUE--CHARACTERISTIC LETTER FROM THE GREAT NEW YORK\r\n    PHILANTHROPIST--HE THINKS THAT VIRTUE SHOULD BE ITS OWN\r\n    REWARD--THE MOST REMARKABLE LETTER EVER WRITTEN BY THE NOBLE\r\n    BENEFACTOR OF THE PEOPLE.”\r\n\r\n“Statues,” wrote Tweed in part, “are not erected to living men, but to\r\nthose who have ended their careers, and where no interest exists to\r\nquestion the partial tributes of friends.” Tweed hinted that he was\r\nnot so deficient in common sense as not to know the bad effect the\r\ntoleration of the scheme would have, and, ever open to suspicion, he\r\nbroadly asserted that the original statue proposition was made either\r\nas a joke or with an unfriendly motive.\r\n\r\nOne of the signers of the circular has assured the author that it was a\r\nserious proposal. The attitude of the _Sun_ confirms this. On March 15\r\nthat newspaper stated editorially that it thought “Mr. Tweed had acted\r\nhastily,” and inquired whether it was too late “to realize so worthy\r\nand so excellent an idea.” In the same issue appears an interview with\r\nJustice Shandley, who says:\r\n\r\n    “We had contemplated eventually making a public proposition\r\n    that the testimonial finally take the form of the establishment\r\n    of a grand charitable institution, bearing Mr. Tweed’s\r\n    honored name, and so overcome the prejudices that the\r\n    statue proposition have engendered, and passing the fame of\r\n    that statesman, philanthropist and patriot down to future\r\n    generations. Mr. Tweed has willed otherwise, and we must\r\n    submit.”\r\n\r\nA Chicago clergyman, reading of the suggestion, publicly declared that\r\nTweed was “more dangerous than were the ancient robber kings.” Copying\r\nthis expression, the _Sun_ urged editorially on May 13:\r\n\r\n    “Now, let the friends of Mr. Tweed combine together and\r\n    answer this clergyman by erecting and endowing the Tweed\r\n    Hospital in the Seventh Ward of this city. A great monument of\r\n    public charity is the best response that can be made to such\r\n    accusations.”\r\n\r\nTweed aimed at a high social place. He had removed from his modest\r\nhouse on Henry street to a pretentious establishment on Fifth Avenue.\r\nHis daughter’s wedding was among the marvels of the day; from her\r\nfather’s personal and political friends she received nearly $100,000\r\nworth of gifts. Among the wedding presents were forty complete sets of\r\nsilver and fifteen diamond sets, one of which was worth $45,000. Her\r\nwedding dress cost $4,000, and the trimmings were worth $1,000.\r\n\r\nAll of his expenditures showed a like disregard of cost. In the\r\nconstruction of the stables adjoining his Summer place at Greenwich,\r\nConn., money “was absolutely thrown away.” The stalls were built of\r\nthe finest mahogany. All told, these stables were said to have cost\r\n$100,000.\r\n\r\nThe Americus Club was his favorite retreat, and there his satellites\r\nfollowed him. Scores of them were only too glad to pay the $1,000\r\ninitiation fee required, in addition to the $2,000 or so charged for\r\nsumptuously fitting the room to which each was entitled. The grandeur\r\nof their club badges well illustrated their extravagance. One style\r\nof the badges was a solid gold tiger’s[19] head in a belt of blue\r\nenamel; the tiger’s eyes were rubies, and above his head sparkled three\r\ndiamonds of enormous size. Another style of badge was of solid gold\r\nwith the tiger’s head in _papier-maché_ under rock crystal. It was\r\nsurrounded by diamonds set in the Americus belt. Above was a pin with a\r\nhuge diamond, with two smaller diamonds on either side. This badge was\r\nestimated to be worth $2,000. A third style showed the tiger’s head in\r\nfrosted gold, with diamond eyes.\r\n\r\nEverywhere the prodigal dissipation of the plunder was visible. Sums\r\nof a few thousand dollars Tweed professed to hold in utter contempt. A\r\ncity creditor once appealed to him to use his influence with Controller\r\nConnolly to have a bill paid. Twenty times he had asked for it, the\r\ncreditor said, and could get it only by paying the 20 per cent.\r\ndemanded. (This 20 per cent., it should be explained, was the sum\r\nextorted from all city creditors by the officials in the Controller’s\r\noffice as their portion after the chiefs of the “ring” had taken the\r\nlion’s share.) Tweed looked at the man a moment and then wrote hastily\r\nto Connolly:\r\n\r\n    “Dear Dick: For God’s sake pay ----’s bill. He tells me your\r\n    people ask 20 per cent. The whole d----d thing isn’t but\r\n    $1,100. If you don’t pay it, I will. Thine. William M. Tweed.”\r\n\r\nThe “Boss’s” note being virtually a command, the bill was paid in full.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Statement of Rev. Dr. H. W.

The Aldermen passed in 1869 a resolution\r\ngiving them (sixteen in all) $200 apiece, for “services.” Mayor Opdyke\r\nvetoed the resolution, but it was passed over his veto.

This animal was the emblem of the Americus\r\nClub, and in Mr. Nast’s cartoons it frequently appears, with the word\r\nAMERICUS on its collar. In all probability Mr. Nast was responsible for\r\nthe transference of the symbol from the club to the organization. The\r\nauthor has been unable to find any earlier reference to the Tammany\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nCOLLAPSE AND DISPERSION OF THE “RING”\r\n\r\n1871-1872\r\n\r\n\r\nThe downfall of the “ring” was inevitable. No such stupendous series\r\nof frauds could reasonably be expected to continue, once the proper\r\nmachinery for their exposure and for the awakening of the dormant\r\npublic conscience was put in motion. Protests and complaints and even\r\nconcerted opposition might for the time prove futile, as indeed they\r\ndid; but the wind had been sown for the reaping of the whirlwind,\r\nand it could not be averted. One conspicuous instance of apparently\r\nfutile criticism of the “ring” was the action of the New York City\r\nCouncil of Political Reform. This body, but recently organized, held a\r\nmass-meeting in Cooper Union, April 6, 1871, to consider “the alarming\r\naspects of public affairs generally,” and to agree upon means for\r\narousing the public to some remedial action. Speeches were made by\r\nHenry Ward Beecher, Judge George C. Barrett, William F. Havemeyer,\r\nWilliam Walter Phelps and William M. Evarts. It was pointed out that\r\nthe city debt had increased from about $36,000,000 in 1868 to over\r\n$136,000,000 at the close of 1870. But amazing as were the facts, the\r\nmeeting produced no direct effect.\r\n\r\nThe immediate causes of the exposure were fortuitous and accidental.\r\nIn December, 1870, Watson, who had become one of the chiefs in the\r\nFinance Department, was fatally injured while sleigh-riding, and died a\r\nweek later. In the resultant change, Stephen C. Lyons, Jr., succeeded\r\nWatson, and Matthew J. O’Rourke succeeded Lyons as County Book-Keeper.\r\nMr. O’Rourke gradually came upon the evidence of the enormous\r\nrobberies. In the meantime some of the evidence had also come into\r\nthe possession of James O’Brien, one of the Young Democracy leaders.\r\nController Connolly was on the point of paying out the $5,000,000\r\ncalled for by the Viaduct Railroad act, as well as other sums, but\r\nlearning of O’Brien’s knowledge of the situation, resolved to defer the\r\npayments. In the Summer of 1871 Mr. O’Rourke presented his evidence to\r\nthe New York _Times_.\r\n\r\nThis newspaper published the figures in detail, producing fresh\r\ndisclosures day after day, and showing indisputably that the city\r\nhad been plundered on a stupendous scale. In two instances alone--in\r\nthe printing bills and the bills for the erection and repairing of\r\nthe County Court House--the _Times_ averred that over $10,000,000\r\nhad been illegally squandered. Tweed had bought an obscure sheet,\r\nthe _Transcript_, and had made it the official organ for city and\r\ncounty advertising. He had also formed the New York Printing Company,\r\nwhich not only did the city printing, but claimed the custom of many\r\npersons and corporations whom he was in a position either to aid or\r\ninjure. These two properties served as the highly useful _media_ with\r\nwhich to extort millions from the city treasury. The _Times_ gave the\r\nincontestible figures, disclosing that the sum of nearly $3,000,000 was\r\nsquandered for county printing, stationery and advertising during the\r\nyears 1869, 1870 and 1871.\r\n\r\nBut the new County Court House, the _Times_ demonstrated, was the\r\nchief means of directly robbing the city. All told, so far as could\r\nbe learned, the sum of $3,500,000 had been spent for “repairs” in\r\nthirty-one months--enough, the _Times_ said, to have built and\r\nfurnished five new buildings such as the County Court House. Merely the\r\nfurnishing, repairing and decorating of this building, it was shown,\r\ncost $7,000,000. One firm alone--Ingersoll & Co.--received, in two\r\nyears, the gigantic sum of $5,600,000 “for supplying the County Court\r\nHouse with furniture and carpets.” In brief, the County Court House, it\r\nwas set forth specifically, instead of costing between $3,000,000 and\r\n$5,000,000, as the “ring” all along had led the public to believe, had\r\nactually cost over $12,000,000, the bulk of which was stolen.\r\n\r\nThe members of the “ring” affected an air of unconcern regarding the\r\ndisclosures. When Tweed was questioned as to the charges, he made his\r\nfamous reply: “What are you going to do about it?” He professed not\r\nto care for newspaper attacks. Yet Thomas Nast’s terribly effective\r\ncartoons pierced him to the heart. “If those picture papers would\r\nonly leave me alone,” he lamented, “I wouldn’t care for all the rest.\r\nThe people get used to seeing me in stripes, and by and by grow to\r\nthink I ought to be in prison.” Mayor Hall put on an air of jocose\r\nindifference, occasionally replying to the charges by references to the\r\nalleged frauds in the Federal Government,[1] but oftener by wondrously\r\nfacetious jests such as: “Counts at Newport are at a discount”;\r\n“shocking levity--the light-ship off Savannah has gone astray”; “these\r\nwarm, yet occasionally breezy days, with charmingly cool mornings and\r\nevenings, are an indication that we are likely to have what befell\r\nAdam--an early Fall.”[2]\r\n\r\nThe public, however, was at last aroused, and the impudent flippancy of\r\nTweed, Hall and others only added to the public indignation. Though the\r\n_Times_ was but imperfectly armed with proofs, each day’s revelations\r\nbrought the citizens to a keener realization of the unprecedented\r\nenormity of the thefts, and the resolve was made by leading members\r\nof both parties in the city to unite and crush the “ring.” A call for\r\na mass-meeting, to be held in Cooper Union, September 4, was met by a\r\ntremendous outpouring of citizens. William F. Havemeyer, the former\r\nMayor, presided, and 227 vice-presidents and 15 secretaries were chosen\r\nfrom among the foremost names in the community. Among the speakers\r\nwere Robert B. Roosevelt and Judge Edwards Pierrepont. Now, for the\r\nfirst time, the public obtained a really definite idea of the magnitude\r\nof the sum stolen by the “ring” and its followers. Resolutions were\r\nreported by Joseph H. Choate, stating that the acknowledged funded and\r\nbonded debt of the city and county was upward of $113,000,000--over\r\n$63,000,000 more than it was when Mayor Hall took office--and that\r\nthere was reason to believe that there were floating, contingent or\r\npretended debts and claims against the city and county which would\r\namount to many more millions of dollars, and which would be paid out\r\nof the city treasury unless the fiscal officers were removed and\r\ntheir proceedings arrested. The resolutions concluded by directing\r\nthe appointment of an Executive Committee of Seventy, to overthrow\r\nthe “ring,” abolish abuses, secure better laws, and by united effort,\r\nwithout reference to party, obtain a good government and honest\r\nofficers to administer it.\r\n\r\nThe first move decided upon by the Committee of Seventy was to make\r\na thorough examination of the city’s accounts. A sub-committee was\r\non the point of doing this when, on the morning of September 11, it\r\nwas reported that the Controller’s office, in the City Hall, had been\r\nbroken into on the previous night and the vouchers, more than 3,500 in\r\nall, stolen. The “ring” confederates pretended that the vouchers had\r\nbeen abstracted from a glass case--an absurd explanation considering\r\nthat after spending $400,000 for safes the city officials should have\r\nchosen such a flimsy receptacle. Later, the charred remains of these\r\nvouchers were discovered in an ash-heap in the City Hall attic.\r\n\r\nAs if to yield to public opinion, Mayor Hall at once asked Connolly\r\nto resign as Controller. Connolly refused, on the ground that such a\r\nstep without impeachment and conviction on trial would be equal to a\r\nconfession of guilt. Secretly, however, fearing that the other members\r\nof the “ring” intended to make a scape-goat of him, he was disposed\r\nto make terms with the Committee of Seventy to save himself. Upon the\r\nadvice of Havemeyer, he appointed Andrew H. Green, Deputy Controller.\r\nWith Mr. Green in that post, the Committee of Seventy could expect a\r\ntangible computation of the “ring’s” thefts. Alive to their danger,\r\nthe other members of the “ring” in terror tried to force Connolly to\r\nresign, so as to end the powers he had delegated to the new Deputy\r\nController. Mayor Hall insisted that in making Mr. Green Acting\r\nController, Connolly’s action was equivalent to a resignation, and with\r\nmuch bluster said he would treat it as such.\r\n\r\nIn October the sub-committee made a hasty examination of such of the\r\ncity accounts as were available, and were enabled to report that the\r\ndebt of the city was doubling every two years; that $3,200,000 had\r\nbeen paid for repairs on armories and drill rooms, the actual cost of\r\nwhich was less than $250,000; that over $11,000,000 had been charged\r\nfor outlays on the unfinished County Court House,[3] the entire cost of\r\nbuilding which, on an honest estimate, would be less than $3,000,000;\r\nthat safes, carpets, furniture, cabinet-work, painting, plumbing, gas\r\nand plastering, had cost $7,289,466, the real value of which was found\r\nto be only $624,180; that $460,000 had been paid for $48,000 worth of\r\nlumber; that the printing, advertising, stationery, etc., of the city\r\nand county had cost in two years and eight months, $7,168,212; that a\r\nlarge number of persons were on the payrolls of the city whose services\r\nwere neither rendered nor needed; and that figures upon warrants and\r\nvouchers had been altered fraudulently and payments made repeatedly on\r\nforged endorsements.\r\n\r\nThese figures, though presenting nothing more than an outline of the\r\nimmensity of corruption, gave the Committee of Seventy a foundation\r\nupon which to proceed legally. It at once obtained an injunction from\r\nJudge Barnard, restraining for the time the payment of all moneys out\r\nof the city treasury.[4] The order was modified subsequently to permit\r\nthe necessary payments. The city treasury had been sacked so completely\r\nthat it was found necessary to borrow nearly a million dollars from the\r\nbanks to satisfy the more pressing claims.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Seventy next presented Mayor Hall before the Grand\r\nJury for indictment. Anticipating this, the “ring” had “packed” the\r\nGrand Jury; but such was the public outcry on this fact becoming known,\r\nthat Judge Barnard was forced to dismiss the jury and order a new\r\npanel. The second jury, however, did not indict the Mayor, giving, as a\r\nreason, the lack of conclusive evidence. Later, Hall was tried, but the\r\njury disagreed. The Committee of Seventy next procured the appointment\r\nof Charles O’Conor as assistant to the Attorney-General, and then\r\nengaged, as O’Conor’s assistants, William M. Evarts, Wheeler H. Peckham\r\nand Judge Emmott, with the express view of driving the “ring” men into\r\nprison. Through their energy, Tweed was arrested, on the affidavit\r\nof Samuel J. Tilden, on October 26, and held to bail in the sum of\r\n$1,000,000.\r\n\r\nBut Tweed was not yet crushed. In a few days--on November 7--an\r\nelection for members of the Legislature, State officers, Judges of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and Aldermen and Assistant Aldermen, was to be\r\nheld. Most of the “ring” men, in the very face of the revelations of\r\ntheir stupendous thefts, forgery, bribing and election frauds, came\r\nforward as candidates for renomination and election. Once elected, they\r\nreckoned upon their “vindication.” The Committee of Seventy naturally\r\naimed at the defeat of the Tammany candidates, both for political\r\nand moral effect, and placed candidates in the field for all local,\r\nlegislative and judicial offices.\r\n\r\nAs Grand Sachem and chairman of the Tammany General Committee, Tweed\r\nwas still “boss.” He arranged to win by his oft-used weapons of bribery\r\nand intimidation, if not by violence. The two Republican Police\r\nCommissioners were his hirelings, owing their offices to him. They\r\ncould be depended upon to aid their Tammany colleagues into making\r\nthe police a power for his benefit. How well, otherwise, the “ring”\r\nwas fortified, was shown when the _Times_[5] charged that sixty-nine\r\nmembers of the Republican General Committee, which assumed to direct\r\nthe counsels of the Republican party in the city, were stipendiaries\r\nof Tweed and Sweeny. One of them was quoted as saying, “I go up to\r\nheadquarters the first of every month and get a hundred dollars, but I\r\ndon’t hold no office and don’t do no work.”\r\n\r\nTammany feigned to regard Tweed as a great benefactor being hounded.\r\nTweed carried out the comedy to his best. On September 22 a “great\r\nTweed mass-meeting” assembled in “Tweed Plaza.” Resolutions were\r\nvociferously adopted, that,\r\n\r\n    “pleased with his past record and having faith in his future,\r\n    recognizing his ability and proud of his leadership, believing\r\n    in his integrity and outraged by the assaults upon it, knowing\r\n    of his steadfastness and commending his courage, admiring his\r\n    magnanimity and grateful for his philanthropy, the Democracy\r\n    of the Fourth Senatorial District of the State of New York,\r\n    constituents of the Hon. William M. Tweed, in mass-meeting\r\n    assembled, place him in nomination for reelection, and pledge\r\n    him their earnest, untiring and enthusiastic support.”[6]\r\n\r\nDespite the public agitation over the frauds, the Tammany nominations\r\nwere of the worst possible character. Nominees for the State Senate\r\nincluded such “ring” men as Genet, “Mike” Norton, John J. Bradley and\r\nWalton; and for the Assembly, “Jim” Hayes, an unscrupulous tool; “Tom”\r\nFields, reputed to be probably the most corrupt man that ever sat in\r\nthe Legislature; Alexander Frear, who for years had engineered “ring”\r\nbills; and “Jimmy” Irving, who had been forced to resign his seat in\r\nthe Assembly the previous Winter to avoid being expelled for a personal\r\nassault on a fellow-member. The innumerable Tammany ward clubs, all\r\nbent on securing a share of the “swag,” paraded and bellowed for these\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThe election proved that the people had really awakened. The victory of\r\nthe Committee of Seventy was sweeping. Of the anti-Tammany candidates,\r\nall of the Judges, four of the five Senators, 15 of the 21 Assemblymen,\r\nand all but two of the Aldermen were elected, and a majority of the\r\nAssistant Aldermen had given pledges for reforms.\r\n\r\nThe one Tammany candidate for Senator elected was the “Boss” himself,\r\nand he won by over 9,000 majority. The frauds in his district were\r\nrepresented by careful observers as enormous. In many precincts it was\r\nunsafe to vote against him. Opposing voters were beaten and driven away\r\nfrom the polls, the police helping in the assaults. The reelection of\r\nTweed, good citizens thought, was the crowning disgrace, and measures\r\nwere soon taken which effectually prevented him from taking his seat.\r\n\r\nOn November 20 Connolly resigned as Controller, and Andrew H. Green\r\nwas appointed in his place. On November 25 Connolly was arrested and\r\nheld in $1,000,000 bail. Unable to furnish it, he was committed to\r\njail. On December 16 Tweed was indicted for felony. While being taken\r\nto the Tombs he was snatched away on a writ of _habeas corpus_ and\r\nhaled before Judge Barnard, who released him on the paltry bail of\r\n$5,000. A fortnight later, forced by public opinion, Tweed resigned as\r\nCommissioner of Public Works, thus giving up his last hold on power.\r\n\r\nThe careers of the “ring” men after 1871 form a striking contrast to\r\ntheir former splendor. Tweed ceased to be Grand Sachem. Almost every\r\nman’s hand seemed raised against him. The newspapers which had profited\r\nmost by his thefts grew rabid in denouncing him and his followers, and\r\nurged the fullest punishment for them.\r\n\r\nHe was tried on January 30, 1873. The jury disagreed. During the next\r\nSummer he fled to California. Voluntarily returning to New York City,\r\nagainst the advice of his friends, he was tried a second time, on\r\ncriminal indictments, on November 19. Found guilty on three-fourths\r\nof the 120 counts, Judge Noah Davis sentenced him to twelve years’\r\nimprisonment and to pay a fine of $12,000. Upon being taken to\r\nBlackwell’s Island, the Warden of the Penitentiary asked him the usual\r\nquestions: “What occupation?” “Statesman!” he replied. “What religion?”\r\n“None.”\r\n\r\nAfter one year’s imprisonment, Tweed was released by a decision of the\r\nCourt of Appeals, on January 15, 1875, on the ground that owing to\r\na legal technicality the one year was all he was required to serve.\r\nAnticipating this decision, Tilden and his associates had secured the\r\npassage of an act by the Legislature, expressly authorizing the People\r\nto institute a civil suit such as they could not otherwise maintain.\r\nNew civil suits were then brought against Tweed, and as soon as he\r\nwas discharged from the Penitentiary he was rearrested and held in\r\n$3,000,000 bail.\r\n\r\nThis bail he could not get, and he lay in prison until December 4,\r\nwhen, while visiting his home, in the custody of two keepers, he\r\nescaped. For two days he hid in New Jersey, and later was taken to a\r\nfarm-house near the Palisades. He disguised himself by shaving his\r\nbeard and clipping his hair, and wearing a wig and gold spectacles.\r\nFleeing again, he spent a while in a fisherman’s hut near the Narrows,\r\nvisiting Brooklyn and assuming the name of “John Secor.” Leaving on a\r\nschooner, he landed on the coast of Florida, whence he went to Cuba\r\nin a fishing smack, landing near Santiago de Cuba. The fallen “Boss”\r\nand a companion were at once arrested as suspicious characters--the\r\nTen Years’ War being then in progress--and Tweed was recognized. He,\r\nhowever, smuggled himself on board the Spanish bark _Carmen_, which\r\nconveyed him to Vigo, Spain. Upon the request of Hamilton Fish,\r\nSecretary of State, he was arrested and turned over to the commander of\r\nthe United States man-of-war _Franklin_, which brought him back to New\r\nYork on November 23, 1876.\r\n\r\nIn one of the civil suits judgment had been given against him for over\r\n$6,000,000. Confessing to this, he was put in jail, to be kept there\r\nuntil he satisfied it, a requirement he said he was unable to meet. The\r\ncity found no personal property upon which to levy. Tweed testified in\r\n1877 that he held about $2,500,000 worth of real estate in 1871, and\r\nthat at no time in his life was he worth more than from that amount to\r\n$3,000,000.[7] He had recklessly parted with a great deal of his money,\r\nhe stated. He testified also to having lost $600,000 in two years in\r\nfitting up the Metropolitan Hotel for one of his sons,[8] and to having\r\npaid his lawyers $400,000 between 1872 and 1875. His escape from Ludlow\r\nStreet Jail had cost him $60,000. It is reasonably certain that he had\r\nbeen blackmailed on all sides, and besides this, as has already been\r\nshown, he had been compelled to disgorge a vast share of the plunder\r\nto members of the Legislature and others. When his troubles began he\r\ntransferred his real estate--and, it is supposed, his money--to his\r\nson, Richard M. Tweed.\r\n\r\nIn Ludlow Street Jail he occupied the Warden’s parlor, at a cost of $75\r\na week. As he lay dying, on April 12, 1878, he said to the matron’s\r\ndaughter: “Mary, I have tried to do good to everybody, and if I have\r\nnot, it is not my fault. I am ready to die, and I know God will receive\r\nme.” To his physician, Dr. Carnochan, he said: “Doctor, I’ve tried to\r\ndo some good, if I haven’t had good luck. I am not afraid to die. I\r\nbelieve the guardian angels will protect me.” The matron said he never\r\nmissed reading his Bible. According to S. Foster Dewey, his private\r\nsecretary, Tweed’s last words were: “I have tried to right some great\r\nwrongs. I have been forbearing with those who did not deserve it. I\r\nforgive all those who have ever done evil to me, and I want all those\r\nwhom I have harmed to forgive me.” Then throwing out his hand to catch\r\nthat of Luke, his black attendant, he breathed his last.\r\n\r\nOnly eight carriages followed the plain hearse carrying his remains,\r\nand the cortège attracted no attention. “If Tweed had died in 1870,”\r\nsaid the cynical Coroner Woltman, one of his former partizans,\r\n“Broadway would have been festooned with black, and every military and\r\ncivic organization in the city would have followed him to Greenwood.”\r\n\r\nSweeny settled with the prosecutor for a few hundred thousand dollars\r\nand found a haven in Paris, until years later he reappeared in New\r\nYork. He lived to an old age. The case of the People against him was\r\nsettled--as the Aldermanic committee appointed in 1877 to investigate\r\nthe “ring” frauds reported to the Common Council--“in a very curious\r\nand somewhat incomprehensible way.”[9] The suits were discontinued on\r\nSweeny agreeing to pay the city the sum of $400,000 “from the estate of\r\nhis deceased brother, James M. Sweeny.” What the motive was in adopting\r\nthis form the committee did not know. The committee styled Sweeny\r\n“the most despicable and dangerous [of the “ring”] because the best\r\neducated and most cunning of the entire gang.”[10]\r\n\r\nConnolly fled abroad with $6,000,000, and died there. Various lesser\r\nofficials also fled, while a few contractors and officials who remained\r\nwere tried and sent to prison, chiefly upon the testimony of Garvey,\r\nwho turned State’s evidence, and then went to London. Under the name of\r\n“A. Jeffries Garvie,” he lived there until his death in 1897.\r\n\r\nOf the three Judges most involved--Barnard, Cardozo and McCunn[11]--the\r\nfirst and the last were impeached, while Cardozo resigned in time to\r\nsave himself from impeachment.\r\n\r\nThe question remains: How much did the “ring” steal? Henry F. Taintor,\r\nthe auditor employed in the Finance Department by Andrew H. Green\r\nto investigate the controller’s books, testified before the special\r\nAldermanic committee, in 1877, that he had estimated the frauds to\r\nwhich the city and county of New York had been subjected, during the\r\nthree and a half years from 1868 to 1871, at from $45,000,000 to\r\n$50,000,000.[12] The special Aldermanic committee, however, evidently\r\nthought the thefts amounted to $60,000,000; for it asked Tweed whether\r\nthey did not approximate that sum, upon which he gave no definite\r\nreply. But Mr. Taintor’s estimate, as he himself admitted, was far from\r\ncomplete, even for the three and a half years. It is the generally\r\naccepted opinion among those who have had the best opportunity for\r\nknowing, that the sums distributed among the “ring” and its allies and\r\ndependents amounted to over $100,000,000. Matthew J. O’Rourke, who,\r\nsince his disclosures, made a further remarkable study of this special\r\nperiod, informed the author that, from 1869 to 1871, the “ring” stole\r\nabout $75,000,000, and that he thought the total stealings from about\r\n1865 to 1871, counting vast issues of fraudulent bonds, amounted to\r\n$200,000,000. Of the entire sum stolen from the city only $876,000 was\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\nThe next question is: Where did all this money go? We have referred to\r\nthe share that remained to Tweed and Connolly, but the other members\r\nof the great “ring” and its subordinate “rings” kept their loot, a few\r\nof them returning to the city a small part by way of restitution. When\r\nGarvey died in London, his estate was valued at $600,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] New York _Times_, August 29, 1871.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, August 30, 1871.\r\n\r\n[3] Later estimates put the expenditures on the Court House at\r\n$13,000,000. The generally accepted figures were over $12,000,000.\r\n\r\n[4] It was John Foley who procured the injunction. Mr. Foley later\r\ninformed the author that upon the original injunction being obtained,\r\nthe “ring” made a great clamor about the thousands of laborers who\r\nwould be deprived of their wages, and ordered their hired newspaper\r\nwriters so to incite the workingmen that the chief movers against the\r\n“ring” would be mobbed. In fact, were it not for public protection,\r\ngrudgingly given on demand, it is doubtful whether some of the\r\nopponents of the “ring” would have survived the excitement.\r\n\r\n[5] August 19, 1871.\r\n\r\n[6] New York _Times_, November 2, 1871.\r\n\r\n[7] _Document No. 8_, p. 306.\r\n\r\n[8] _Document No. 8_, p. 372.\r\n\r\n[9] _Document No. 8_, p. 29.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._, p. 30.\r\n\r\n[11] Barnard and Cardozo were both Sachems.

But the wonderful instinct of\r\nself-preservation which had always characterized Tammany, joined with\r\nthe remarkable sagacity which its chiefs almost invariably displayed\r\nin critical times, now conspired to keep the organization alive\r\ndespite every antagonistic influence. The Tammany Society still had\r\nits charter, and while that charter remained intact, Tammany retained\r\nstrong potentialities for regaining power. The reformers neglected\r\nto ask for its annulment--though it is doubtful if they could have\r\nobtained it, since the Governor, John T. Hoffman, was a creation of the\r\nTammany organization.\r\n\r\nThe urgent need of the Wigwam was a leader. In response to the demand,\r\ntwo men, John Kelly and John Morrissey, stepped to the front. Both of\r\nthem were the product of local politics, and having made a science\r\nof their experience, they knew that the Tammany Hall that now lay\r\nprostrate and reviled could be raised and again made a political\r\nfactor, and eventually the ruler of the city. The few men of fair\r\ncharacter in the organization were undesirous of appearing too\r\nprominently in its councils; but despite the general odium attached to\r\nit, Kelly and Morrissey found that a large part of the thoughtless\r\nmass of the Democratic voters were still willing to follow its\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nKelly had been in Europe from 1868 to late in 1871, and had not been\r\ndirectly implicated in the Tweed frauds. He had a strong personality,\r\nand was popular among the largest and most energetic part of the voting\r\npopulation--the Irish. He was called “Honest John Kelly,” and he took\r\ncare to strengthen the belief implied in that name, surrounding himself\r\nat all times with a glamour of political probity. Born April 20, 1822,\r\nin New York City, of poor parents, his early life was divided between\r\nhard work and fighting, though he never appeared in the prize-ring. His\r\ntrade was that of a grate-setter and mason. His early education was\r\ndefective, but he later improved his natural talents by study at the\r\nparochial and evening schools.\r\n\r\nThe district in which he lived was the roughest in the city. Being a\r\nman of aggressive ways and popular enough to control the turbulent\r\nelements, the politicians in 1858 had him elected an Alderman, a post\r\nwhich he retained during 1854 and 1855. In this body he was known as a\r\n“bench-warmer”--that is, a member who kept his seat and followed the\r\norders of his political masters without question. Giving satisfaction,\r\nhe was selected to run for Congress in the district then represented by\r\n“Mike” Walsh--who was regarded in Washington as the leader of the rowdy\r\nelement of New York City. Walsh ran independently, but Kelly beat him\r\nby 18 votes in a total vote of 7,593. It was generally charged then and\r\nlong after that Kelly was “counted in.” Later he was reelected. During\r\nhis terms in Congress, Kelly controlled most of the Federal patronage\r\nin New York City, and it was through his influence especially that\r\nIsaac V. Fowler--who, as we have mentioned, was afterward found to have\r\nembezzled over $155,000 from the Government--was reappointed Postmaster\r\nby Buchanan.\r\n\r\nIn 1863 Kelly, disgruntled at not being appointed a Police\r\nCommissioner, led a portion of the Irish vote from the Wigwam over\r\nto the Germans, helping in the election of Gunther as Mayor. Having\r\nproved his influence, Tweed, in order to gain him over, gave him the\r\nnomination for Sheriff, to which office he was elected. His nomination\r\nfor Mayor and his sudden withdrawal we have already related.\r\n\r\nAt the time of his flight to Europe he was a rich man. Mayor Havemeyer\r\ncharged, in 1874, as we shall see, that some, at least, of Kelly’s\r\nwealth was obtained by anything but proper methods.\r\n\r\nThis was the successor of Tweed as the “boss” of Tammany Hall. His\r\ncoadjutor for a time, John Morrissey, was a professional prize-fighter\r\nand gambler, whose boast was that he “had never fought foul nor turned\r\na card.”[1] When these men assumed control of the Wigwam, few persons\r\nbelieved it could outlive the “ring” revelations and regain power.\r\n\r\nThen occurred an extraordinary happening, though quite in keeping with\r\nTammany shrewdness. At the society’s annual election, in April, 1872,\r\nKelly and Augustus Schell (who had been elected Grand Sachem after\r\nTweed was forced to resign) caused to be selected as Sachems some of\r\nthe identical men who had been most conspicuous in the reform movement,\r\nsuch as Samuel J. Tilden, Charles O’Conor, Horatio Seymour, Sanford\r\nE. Church and August Belmont. The best proof that the non-partizan\r\nmovement of 1871 was already dissolving was the readiness with which\r\nthese men accepted these elections. Their acceptance may have been due\r\nto a mixed desire to make of the organization a real reform body as\r\nwell as to advance their political fortunes.\r\n\r\nThe Tammany Society now stood before the public as a reform body,\r\nwith the boast that all the thieves had been cast out. Next it\r\nappointed a reorganization committee to reconstruct the Tammany Hall\r\npolitical organization. Under its direction the general committee was\r\nenlarged to nearly five hundred members, and a new general committee,\r\nof unquestionably better quality than its predecessor, was elected.\r\nIn the case of disputing district delegations, the Tammany Society’s\r\ncommittee decided by selecting the best men for both.[2] Out of chaos,\r\nwithin a few months of the “ring’s” overthrow, Kelly created a strong\r\norganization, so deftly composed as to place itself before the people\r\nas an entirely distinct set of men from the “ring” thieves--as a really\r\nDemocratic body, quite as heartily in favor of good government as the\r\nmost exacting reformer.\r\n\r\nKelly acted with great shrewdness, executive force, knowledge of men,\r\nand apparent regard for the public interests and proprieties. He\r\naffected extreme modesty, and made it appear that the delegates chose\r\nnominees by their own uninfluenced will. At the Judiciary convention in\r\nTammany Hall, in October, 1872, he insisted that each delegate vote; in\r\nhis speech he said that Tammany should have no more of the times when\r\ntickets were made up outside of conventions. Some delegates shouting\r\nfor the nomination of a man of dubious character, he declared, with the\r\nair of a man exerting himself for the good of his party only, that it\r\nwas time that Tammany Hall should put such a ticket in the field that\r\nno man could hold up the finger of scorn at any individual on it. He\r\nfurthermore caused the appointment of a committee to cooperate in the\r\nwork of reform with the Bar Association, the Committee of Seventy, the\r\nMunicipal Taxpayers’ Association and the Liberal Republicans.\r\n\r\nAt Kelly’s suggestion the Wigwam, in the Fall of 1872, nominated for\r\nMayor, Abraham R. Lawrence, a member of the Committee of Seventy and\r\nits counsel, and for Judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts, men\r\nof ability and unimpeachable name. Altogether, Tammany took on such a\r\nnew guise that thousands of voters returned to its support. But the\r\nanti-Tammany movement had not yet dissipated its strength, even though\r\nit presented a divided front. One wing of this opposition was the new\r\n“reform” organization, the “Apollo Hall Democracy,” founded by James\r\nO’Brien, who now stood forth as its candidate for Mayor. The other\r\nwing, composed of the individuals and associations centering about the\r\nCommittee of Seventy, nominated William F. Havemeyer.\r\n\r\nTammany had the advantage of a Presidential year, when the obligation\r\nof “regularity” could be imposed upon a goodly share of the Democratic\r\nvoters, and the further advantage of a high order of personal character\r\nin its nominees. Nevertheless, Havemeyer won, the vote standing\r\napproximately: Havemeyer, 53,806; Lawrence, 45,398; O’Brien, 31,121.\r\nThe results from several election districts were missing and were\r\nnever canvassed by the Board of Canvassers. For Horace Greeley, the\r\nDemocratic Presidential candidate, Tammany Hall carried the city by\r\n23,000 majority.\r\n\r\nMayor Havemeyer’s administration differed greatly from most of the\r\n“reform” administrations that had preceded it. Never since the year\r\n1800 had the city revenue been distributed with such great care. The\r\nutmost regard was paid to the ordinances dealing with public health\r\nand security, and the streets were kept cleaner than ever before. The\r\nrowdy and criminal classes were deprived of the free sway they had so\r\nlong enjoyed. The public school system was improved, and the standard\r\nof official character was of a higher type than had been known in\r\nmany a decade. The city expenditures in 1873 were about $32,000,000,\r\nas compared with $36,262,589.41 in 1871, and notwithstanding the\r\ntremendous legacy of debt left by the Tweed “ring” to be shouldered by\r\nlater administrations, Mayor Havemeyer’s administration reduced the\r\ncity expenses about $8,000,000 in reality, though the bare figures on\r\ntheir face did not show that result.\r\n\r\nMayor Havemeyer complained, as so many of his predecessors had done,\r\nof the perverse interference of the Legislature in city affairs--an\r\ninterference which constantly embarrassed his plans and set back the\r\ncause of reform.\r\n\r\nThe Mayor was not destined to serve his full term. In September, 1874,\r\na bitter quarrel sprang up between him on the one hand and John Kelly\r\nand John Morrissey on the other, apparently over the appointment, at\r\nKelly’s request, of Richard Croker to be a Marshal. “When Croker’s\r\nappointment was announced,” wrote the Mayor, “I was overwhelmed with\r\na torrent of indignation.” In a public letter addressed to Kelly,\r\nMayor Havemeyer charged that the former, while Sheriff, had obtained\r\n$84,482 by fraudulent and illegal receipts, adding this further\r\ncharacterization:\r\n\r\n    “I think that you were worse than Tweed, except that he was\r\n    a larger operator. The public knew that Tweed was a bold,\r\n    reckless man, making no pretensions to purity. You, on the\r\n    contrary, were always avowing your honesty and wrapped yourself\r\n    in the mantle of piety. Men who go about with the prefix of\r\n    ‘honest’ to their names are often rogues.”\r\n\r\nKelly replied that he had acted in the Sheriff’s office as had his\r\npredecessors, and brought a libel suit against the Mayor, in the answer\r\nto which the latter embodied his charges in full. But on the day the\r\nsuit was to come to trial Havemeyer fell dead of apoplexy in his office.\r\n\r\nDuring the two years (1872-74) various forces combined to restore\r\nTammany to the old power. The two great parties were struggling for\r\npartizan advantage for future State and national elections. This\r\nbrought about the old party alignment, the reform Democrats, as a\r\nrule, acting with the Wigwam, and the reform Republicans drifting to\r\nthe Republican side. The disreputable classes issued forth in greater\r\nforce than ever to help replace in power the Tammany that meant to\r\nthem free sway. The panic of 1873, with the consequent “hard times,”\r\nturned great bodies of voters against the dominant party. The “ring”\r\nhad so thoroughly looted the city that Havemeyer’s administration was\r\nforced to practise economy in the public works. The working classes\r\neither did not understand the motive of this retrenchment, or did not\r\nappreciate it. Out of the 24,500 mechanics in the city during the\r\nWinter of 1873-74, 15,000, it was estimated, were unemployed. Tammany\r\nnow adroitly declared itself in favor of giving public employment to\r\nthe workers. The Wigwam agents scoured the poorer districts during the\r\ncampaign of 1874, giving aid to the needy, and gained their support.\r\nThe agitation against a third term for President Grant; the demand for\r\na low tariff and the denunciation of the Washington “ring,” all had\r\ntheir effect, while the impression which naturally might have been\r\nexpected from Havemeyer’s charges against Kelly was entirely lost by\r\nthe former’s slurring allusions to Kelly’s humble birth and early\r\noccupation--allusions which threw the sympathy and support of the\r\nmasses strongly to Kelly and his ticket.\r\n\r\nThe astonishing consequence was that in November, 1874, Tammany Hall\r\nwhich, in 1871, seemed buried beneath obloquy, elected its candidate\r\nfor Mayor, William H. Wickham (a diamond merchant and an anti-“ring”\r\nDemocrat and a member of the Committee of Seventy) by nearly 9,000\r\nmajority over all, his vote being 70,071, against 24,226 for Oswald\r\nOttendorfer, the Independent Democratic candidate, and 36,953 for Salem\r\nH. Wales, the Republican. At the same election, Tilden, who had also\r\ncontributed to the downfall of the “ring,” received the solid support\r\nof Tammany, and was elected to the Governorship.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall under the surface was rapidly becoming its old self. Its\r\ncandidate for Register, “Jim” Hayes, had made, it was charged, $500,000\r\nduring the Tweed régime. Fully three-fourths of the office-seekers in\r\nthis election were connected with the liquor interests; and as many of\r\nthese were keepers of low groggeries, they were in constant conflict\r\nwith the law. Nine of the fifteen Tammany candidates for Aldermen were\r\nformer creatures or beneficiaries of the “ring,” one of them being\r\nunder two indictments for fraud. Yet the partizan currents at work\r\nagain swept almost all of them into office.\r\n\r\nWell realizing the value of appearances, Kelly lectured the new members\r\nof the Common Council,[3] telling them that “there must be no bad\r\nmeasures, no ‘rings,’ no getting together of a few men for the purpose\r\nof making money and controlling patronage.” Yet Kelly himself at this\r\ntime absolutely controlled the strongest and probably the most corrupt\r\npolitical organization in the Union. He dictated State, Judicial,\r\nCongressional, Legislative and municipal nominations at will, and\r\ncontinued to be the absolute “boss” until his death in 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] In Tweed’s confession (1877) Morrissey is mentioned as having\r\nintroduced a system of repeating from Philadelphia, and also as having\r\nacted as paymaster of the fund of $65,000 distributed among the\r\nAldermen to secure the confirmation of Sweeny as Chamberlain.\r\n\r\n[2] The reorganization committee reached the understanding that the\r\nsociety should thereafter keep in the background and that it should not\r\nprominently interfere in the organization’s affairs.\r\n\r\n[3] Amendments to the charter, passed in 1873, vested local powers in a\r\nBoard of Aldermen and a Board of Assistant Aldermen--the latter to be\r\nabolished on and after January 1, 1875, and the Board of Aldermen to\r\nform thenceforth the Common Council. The Common Council was not to pass\r\nany measure over the Mayor’s veto without the vote of two-thirds of all\r\nits members. A part of the former Aldermanic powers was restored to\r\nthis board by the amendments of 1873 and later years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATORSHIP OF JOHN KELLY\r\n\r\n1874-1886\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the Tammany Society and of Tammany Hall during\r\nthe period from 1874 onward embraces a vast and intricate web of\r\ninfluences, activities and consequences. To present this period in the\r\ndetail proportionate to that employed in the preceding chapters would\r\nrequire an amount of space inconsistent with the projected volume\r\nof this work. It will, therefore, be presented in the manner of a\r\nCOMPREHENSIVE SUMMARY, in which the main movement will be outlined,\r\nand particular treatment given only to the more important features and\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1874 Kelly’s rule had become supreme. Under the form\r\nof “requests” he assessed every office-holder, even calling upon men\r\nreceiving only $1,000 a year to pay as much as $250. To systematize\r\nthese assessments, he established a regular collectorship, in charge\r\nof the society’s Wiskinskie, a city employee drawing $1,500 a year for\r\napparent services. Abundant charges, some of which were proved, were\r\nmade as to corruption in many of the city departments.\r\n\r\nDuring the next year (1875) a number of disaffected Wigwam men formed\r\nthe “Irving Hall Democracy” and issued an address denouncing the\r\nTammany General Committee as the creature of the society. The effect of\r\nthis defection and of the charges of public corruption were such that\r\nin the local elections Tammany lost many of the minor offices.\r\n\r\nThe friendship between Kelly and Tilden had already been broken. Kelly\r\norganized a bitter opposition to Tilden at the St. Louis National\r\nconvention, in 1876, but pledged himself to support the nominations,\r\nand kept his word.\r\n\r\nThe Presidential campaign of this year held the municipal struggle\r\nwithin strict party lines. The various Democratic factions united on\r\nSmith Ely, electing him Mayor by a majority of 53,517 over John A. Dix,\r\nthe Republican candidate.\r\n\r\nFrom December, 1876, to December, 1880, Kelly filled the position\r\nof City Controller, and was credited with reducing the city debt.\r\nPolitics, however, rather than fiscal administration for the benefit\r\nof the city, continued to be his main business. One of the numerous\r\nexamples of his superior sagacity in bowing to the general public\r\nsentiment was his support, in 1878, of Edward Cooper, an anti-Tammany\r\nnominee for Mayor, a man of recognized independence of character, who\r\nwas elected. Tammany at this time was still largely influenced by the\r\nold Tweed conspirators, the assertion being made in 1877 that at least\r\nfifty former office-holders under Tweed were to be found in the general\r\ncommittee.[1]\r\n\r\nIn 1879 occurred the well-known fight of Tammany against the Democrats\r\nof the rest of the State. The Democratic State convention had assembled\r\nat Syracuse. The roll-call had barely begun when Augustus Schell,\r\nspokesman for the Tammany organization, stated that as there was every\r\nprospect that Gov. Lucius Robinson would be renominated, the delegates\r\nfrom New York City would withdraw, although they stood ready to support\r\nany other name. This “suggestion,” as Schell afterwards called it,\r\nwas unheeded, whereupon the entire Tammany delegation retired. The\r\ndelegation meeting elsewhere, Kelly, with the specific object of\r\ndefeating Robinson, caused himself to be nominated for Governor. The\r\nquarrel between Robinson and the Tammany chief was personal, arising\r\nfrom the fact that the Governor had removed Henry A. Gumbleton, a\r\nprominent Wigwam man, from the office of County Clerk. Such was the\r\ndiscipline to which Kelly had reduced the organization that it obeyed\r\nhis word without a single protest.\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in his ulterior object. His 77,566 votes caused the defeat\r\nof Robinson, who received 375,790 votes, to 418,567 for Alonzo B.\r\nCornell, the Republican candidate. The significant lesson furnished by\r\nKelly’s making good his threat, was one generally heeded thereafter by\r\nState and national politicians and candidates, who declined to invite\r\nthe hostility of so great a power. But for this secession, and the\r\nconsequent demoralization of the Democratic party in the State, New\r\nYork’s electoral vote, it is generally thought, would have gone to Gen.\r\nHancock in 1880. Mayor Cooper refused to reappoint Kelly to the office\r\nof Controller at the expiration of his term, in December, 1880, because\r\nof his supposed agency in the defeat of Hancock.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Democrats of the city were divided into the factions of\r\nTammany Hall and Irving Hall, but laying aside differences till after\r\nthe election, they agreed upon an apportionment of the local offices.\r\nThe Democratic candidate for Mayor, William R. Grace, was selected\r\nby the Tammany committee from a list of names submitted by Irving\r\nHall. Many of the members of the latter organization, however, were\r\nprejudiced against Mr. Grace because of his Roman Catholic faith,\r\nfearing that in case of his election the public school appropriations\r\nwould be diverted to sectarian uses. They joined with the Republicans\r\nin support of William Dowd. The vote stood: Grace, 101,760; Dowd,\r\n98,715.\r\n\r\nMayor Grace’s official power was considerably limited by the action\r\nof the Legislature, which had made the tenure of office of executives\r\nof departments longer than his own--a law which in effect put the\r\ndepartment heads in a position independent of the Mayor. In frequent\r\nmessages, Mayor Grace expressed himself, as had Mayor Havemeyer,\r\npointedly, though vainly, on the evils of legislative interference with\r\nthe local government.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1880, a new organization, called the “New York County\r\nDemocracy,” was formed by Abram S. Hewitt and others, to oppose both\r\nTammany Hall and Irving Hall. This body soon had a large enrolled\r\nmembership, and was joined later by a number of Democrats who had\r\nunsuccessfully attempted to bring about reform in Tammany. To that end\r\nthey had made an effort, at the society’s annual election in April,\r\n1881, to elect their candidates for Sachems, when the ticket headed by\r\nKelly won by an average majority of 50 in about 775 votes. The fact, or\r\nbelief, that the result was secured through repeating and other unfair\r\nmeans, caused a considerable defection from Tammany.\r\n\r\nIn the State convention of October, 1881, the Tammany delegation was\r\nruled out, and the County Democracy was declared “regular.” At an\r\nearlier period this adverse decision might have entailed serious, if\r\nnot fatal, consequences to the Wigwam. But now that the organization\r\nwas in a state of absolute discipline, ruled by one hard-headed,\r\ntireless “boss,” with each member understanding that his self-interest\r\nrequired his “standing by” the organization in times of trouble, as\r\nwell as in times of triumph, the blow had no lasting effect.\r\n\r\nHolding the balance of power in the Legislature of 1882, the Tammany\r\nmembers resolved to force the “regular” Democracy to make terms with\r\nthem. To that end they attended no party caucuses, and refused to\r\nsupport men nominated by the “regular” Democrats. At Kelly’s order they\r\ndemanded, as the price of their cooperation, certain chairmanships\r\nof important committees. Not getting them, they continued for weeks\r\ntheir stubborn opposition. Finally the two houses were organized, the\r\nTammany men voting for the Republican candidate for clerk. Charges were\r\nfreely made of a political bargain between Kelly and Gov. Cornell.\r\n\r\nThere were three Democratic factions in the city in 1882--Tammany Hall,\r\nIrving Hall and the County Democracy. A movement to obtain non-partizan\r\ngovernment caused the independent nomination of Allan Campbell for\r\nMayor. The Republicans indorsed him, but their support was greatly\r\nweakened by their nomination of a spoils politician, John J. O’Brien,\r\nfor County Clerk. The three Democratic factions agreed on Franklin\r\nEdson, who was elected by a majority of 21,417, the vote being: Edson,\r\n97,802; Campbell, 76,385.\r\n\r\nIn the Chicago national convention of 1884 the Tammany delegation\r\nbitterly opposed the nomination of Grover Cleveland, its orators\r\nvirulently assailing his private and public character. Though\r\nprofessing afterward to support him as the Democratic candidate, the\r\nWigwam refused to unite with other Democratic organizations in any\r\npolitical demonstration. The reason seems to have been Mr. Cleveland’s\r\npublicly expressed independence of Kelly and his machine. After the\r\nensuing election, Tammany was generally charged with treachery. The\r\nWigwam nominated a separate city and county ticket, naming Hugh J.\r\nGrant for Mayor. The County Democracy and Irving Hall agreed upon the\r\nnomination of former Mayor William R. Grace, and elected him with\r\nthe rest of the fusion ticket, the vote being: Grace, 96,288; Grant,\r\n86,361; Frederick S. Gibbs (Republican), 45,386.\r\n\r\nIn these years the control of the city offices was frequently divided\r\namong the various parties and factions. In the Board of Aldermen, as in\r\nthe departments, were Tammany and County Democracy men and Republicans,\r\nso that no one faction or party completely swayed the city. Much of\r\ntheir former power had been restored to the Aldermen by the charter\r\namendments of 1873, by the State constitution of 1874 and various\r\nlegislative acts. Reports arose from time to time that money was used\r\nto secure confirmation of appointments by the Aldermen, but the nearest\r\napproach to detail was the testimony of Patrick H. McCann before the\r\n“Fassett Committee” in 1890.\r\n\r\nMr. McCann testified that Richard Croker, a brother-in-law, came to his\r\nstore in 1884, with a bag containing $180,000, which, he said, was to\r\nbe used in obtaining Aldermanic votes to secure the confirmation, in\r\ncase of his appointment, of Hugh J. Grant as Public Works Commissioner,\r\nand that he (Mr. Croker) was to get ten cents a barrel on all cement\r\nused by that department.[2] Mr. McCann further testified that Mr.\r\nCroker had told him that $80,000 of this sum was furnished by Mr.\r\nGrant, and the remainder by the organization. Mr. Croker, according\r\nto the same testimony, opened negotiations through Thomas D. Adams\r\nfor the purchase of two Republican Aldermen, whose votes were needed.\r\nThe alleged “deal,” however, was not consummated, and the money was\r\nreturned. Mr. Croker and Mr. Grant both swore that these statements\r\nwere untrue.[3]\r\n\r\nBut the extraordinary corruption of the Board of Aldermen of 1884 is a\r\nmatter of public record. Twenty-one members--the exceptions among those\r\npresent and voting being Aldermen Grant and O’Connor--voted to give the\r\nfranchise for a surface railway on Broadway to the Broadway Surface\r\nRailroad Company.[4] The rival road, the Broadway Railroad Company,\r\nsought to bribe the Aldermen with $750,000, half cash and half bonds,\r\nbut the Aldermen thought the bonds might be traced, and considered\r\nit wiser to accept the $500,000 cash offered by the former,[5] each\r\nAlderman receiving $22,000.[6] Mayor Edson vetoed the resolution,[7]\r\nbut it was repassed.\r\n\r\nOther street railway franchises were passed by the same board. Mr.\r\nMcCann testified in 1890 that Mr. Grant had told him that Mr. Croker\r\nstrongly advised him [Grant] not to have anything to do with “that\r\nBroadway matter,” as “they [the other Aldermen] would be caught.”[8]\r\nMr. Grant denied having said so.[9] The fact remains that Mr. Grant\r\nwas the only Tammany Alderman free of suspicion. Many of the accused\r\nTammany city fathers were members of the organization’s executive\r\ncommittee, which was composed almost exclusively of leaders, and which\r\nwas supposed to direct the Wigwam’s affairs.[10]\r\n\r\nOne Alderman, Henry W. Jaehne, was sentenced to penal servitude at hard\r\nlabor for the term of nine years and ten months; and another, “Honest”\r\nJohn O’Neill, to four years and a half, and to pay a fine of $2,000;\r\na third, Arthur J. McQuade, was sentenced to seven years and ordered\r\nto return $5,000 of the bribe money to the city, but on July 20, 1889,\r\nat a new trial at Ballston, he was acquitted. Six other Aldermen\r\nfled to Canada, and three turned State’s evidence. Ten others were\r\nindicted, but were never brought to trial. As Col. John R. Fellows, the\r\nDistrict Attorney who tried the cases, stated to the Fassett Committee,\r\nconvictions could not then (1890) be secured, because public sentiment\r\nhad changed; the storm had subsided; people had grown tired of the\r\nsubject, and many former opponents of the franchise had come to look\r\nupon it as a benefit.[11] But there were strong hints that political\r\ninfluence had saved many persons from prison.\r\n\r\nThough the facts did not come out until the trials in 1886, public\r\nindignation and suspicion were so strong in 1884 that Kelly insisted\r\nthat the Tammany Aldermen who had voted for the franchise should not be\r\nrenominated.[12]\r\n\r\nKelly broke down with nervous and physical prostration after the\r\nPresidential campaign of 1884. Grover Cleveland’s election, which\r\nfalsified his predictions, deeply disappointed him. He kept to his\r\nhouse, No. 34 East Sixty-ninth street, but still issued his orders to\r\nthe Tammany organization. Towards the end, he could not sleep except by\r\nthe use of opiates. He died on June 1, 1886.\r\n\r\nThus passed away the second absolute “boss” of Tammany Hall. For more\r\nthan ten years 50,000 voters obeyed his commands, and it was he and not\r\nthe people to whom a host of office-holders, contractors, and all who\r\nprofited directly or indirectly from politics, looked as the source of\r\ntheir appointment, employment or emolument. On more than one occasion\r\nKelly complained of his onerous duty of providing government for New\r\nYork City. The secret of his control was the same as that of Tweed and\r\nof the previous cliques: he knew that a large part of the voting mass\r\ncared nothing for good government, but looked upon politics solely as\r\na means of livelihood; that another large part were satisfied to vote\r\nthe “regular” ticket under any and all circumstances; and, with a keen\r\nunderstanding of human nature, he knew how to harmonize conflicting\r\ninterests, to allay personal differences, and to soothe with large\r\npromises of future rewards his disaffected followers. Profiting by\r\nTweed’s fate, he knew the value of moderation; and he earned the\r\npraise, not only of his interested followers, but also of a tolerant\r\nand easy-going class in the community, through the fact that under his\r\nrule the stealing, compared to that of the Tweed régime, was kept at\r\na comparatively respectable minimum. It was pointed out to his credit\r\nthat the fortune he left--reputed to be $500,000--was very reasonable\r\nfor one who so long had held real control of a great city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Document No. 8_, p. 102.\r\n\r\n[2] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, 1890, Vol. I, pp. 682-98.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, 733, and _Ibid._, Vol. II, p. 1693.\r\n\r\n[4] _Proceedings of the Board of Aldermen_, Vol. CLXXV, pp. 237-39.\r\n\r\n[5] Alderman Arthur J.

However, cliques immediately arose, and soon four\r\nleaders--Richard Croker, who had been a sort of deputy “boss” under\r\nKelly; Hugh J. Grant, Thomas F. Gilroy and W. Bourke Cockran--arranged\r\na junta for administering the organization’s affairs. By securing the\r\nsupport of 17 of the 24 leaders, Mr. Croker began concentrating power\r\nin his own hands, and for about fourteen years remained the absolute\r\n‘boss’ of both society and organization.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker was born near Cork, Ireland, November 24, 1843. His father\r\nwas a blacksmith, who emigrated to America in 1846, and settled in a\r\nsquatter’s shanty in what is now the upper portion of Central Park.\r\nFrom his thirteenth to his nineteenth year young Croker worked as\r\na machinist. At a very early age he distinguished himself in the\r\nsemi-social fist-fights which were a part of the life of the “gang”\r\nto which he belonged. He became, tradition has it, the leader of\r\nthe “Fourth Avenue Tunnel Gang,” and fought a number of formal\r\nprize-fights, in which he came out victor.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the Tweed régime, according to his testimony\r\nbefore the Fassett Committee, he was an attendant under Judge Barnard\r\nand other Judges in the Supreme Court. Upon leaving that place, for\r\nsome reason not known, he served as an engineer on a Fire Department\r\nsteamer.[1] In 1868 and 1869 he was elected an Alderman. With a\r\nmajority of his fellow-members, he sided with the Young Democracy\r\nagainst Tweed, and was accordingly, with the rest of the board,\r\nlegislated out of office (April, 1870). But he must have made his\r\npeace with the “Boss” soon after, for Controller Connolly appointed\r\nhim Superintendent of Market Fees and Rents. In 1873 he was elected\r\nCoroner. On election day, November 3, 1874, during a street row growing\r\nout of a political quarrel between Mr. Croker and James O’Brien, John\r\nMcKenna was shot dead. Bystanders maintained that Mr. Croker fired the\r\nshot, and the Grand Jury indicted him for the crime. The trial jury,\r\nafter being out for seventeen hours, failed to agree. Public opinion\r\nat the time was divided, but it is the preponderance of opinion among\r\nthose who are in a position to know, that Mr. Croker did not fire the\r\nfatal shot.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 he was reelected Coroner. In 1883 he ran for Alderman, with\r\nthe understanding that if elected, thus establishing the fact of\r\nhis constituents’ approval, Mayor Edson would appoint him a Fire\r\nCommissioner. During the canvass, a Police Captain, one of Croker’s\r\nprotégés, was responsible for a brutal clubbing, the feeling over which\r\nhad the effect of reducing his plurality to about 200. Mayor Edson,\r\nhowever, gave him the appointment, and he was reappointed by Mayor\r\nHewitt. His alleged connection with the fund of $180,000 to be used in\r\nbehalf of Hugh J. Grant, in 1884, has already been mentioned. In 1885\r\nhe caused the nomination of the latter for Sheriff. Mr. Grant, while\r\nin that office, according to Mr. McCann’s testimony, gave $25,000, in\r\nfive presents of $5,000 each, to Mr. Croker’s two-year-old daughter\r\nFlossie.[2]\r\n\r\nNeither Mr. Croker nor Mr. Grant denied this transaction, though both\r\ndeclared the sum was $10,000 and not $25,000.[3] Mr. Grant furthermore\r\ndeclared that he gave it in consideration of Flossie being his\r\ngod-child.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker showed the sagacity common to a long line of Tammany chiefs\r\nin the municipal campaign of 1886. It was a time of great excitement.\r\nThe labor unions, including the Knights of Labor, had reached the\r\nhighest point in organization and in solidarity of feeling ever\r\nattained by them in the history of the city. Knowing their strength,\r\nthey were ripe for independent political action, and they were rendered\r\nall the more ready for it by the earnest social propaganda carried on\r\nat the time by Single-Taxers, Socialists and social reformers generally.\r\n\r\nThe conviction of certain members of a union for carrying on a boycott\r\nagainst the Thiess establishment, on Fourteenth street, proved the\r\none impulse needed for the massing together of all the various clubs\r\nand unions into one mighty movement. The convictions were believed\r\nto be illegal, and moreover to have been fraudulently obtained--and\r\nTammany was held responsible. Before long the nucleus of an independent\r\npolitical party was formed. Henry George, then at the height of his\r\npopularity, was looked upon as the logical leader, and he was asked to\r\nbecome the new party’s candidate for Mayor. To this request he gave an\r\naffirmative answer, contingent upon the securing of 25,000 signatures\r\nto his nominating petition.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker saw the danger, and he took immediate steps to avert it.\r\nAccording to the open letter of Henry George to Abram S. Hewitt,\r\nOctober 17, 1897, Mr. Croker, in behalf of Tammany Hall and the County\r\nDemocracy, tried to buy off George by offering him a nomination\r\nregarded as equivalent to an election. George, of course, refused;\r\nthe 25,000 names, or a great part of them, were secured; a nominating\r\nconvention was held; George was formally nominated, and the United\r\nLabor party was launched. A spirited campaign in George’s behalf was\r\nat once begun, and was responded to by the masses with remarkable\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker was equal to the crisis. The agitation among the masses\r\nmust be met by the nomination of a representative of the conservative\r\ninterests, and a general appeal be made for the “saving of society.”\r\nAccordingly he chose as the Tammany candidate the County Democracy’s\r\nchoice, Abram S. Hewitt.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans nominated Theodore Roosevelt. His candidacy, however,\r\nwas not regarded so seriously as otherwise it might have been, for the\r\ncontest narrowed down at once to a class struggle between George and\r\nMr. Hewitt. Anarchy and every other social ill were prophesied by the\r\nconservatives as the certain results of the former’s election, and\r\nRepublicans were openly urged to support the latter.\r\n\r\nThe result proved the keenness of Mr. Croker’s foresight. The vote\r\nstood: Hewitt, 90,552; George, 68,110; Roosevelt, 60,435. Yet it\r\nwould be difficult to name a time in recent years, if the reiterated\r\nstatements of reputable eye-witnesses are to be believed, when frauds\r\nso glaring and so tremendous in the aggregate have been employed in\r\nbehalf of any candidate as were committed in behalf of Mr. Hewitt in\r\n1886. There are few living men among the earnest band who supported\r\nGeorge’s interests at the polls on that election day who do not believe\r\nthat their candidate was grossly “counted out.”\r\n\r\nMayor Hewitt revealed an independence of character that astonished\r\nthe Wigwam. Before many months he had antagonized its powerful\r\nleaders. By 1888 the United Labor party had dwindled into a faction,\r\nand there being no such compelling reason, as in 1886, for choosing\r\na candidate outside of the organization, the chiefs selected one of\r\ntheir own number, Hugh J. Grant. Mr. Hewitt was nominated by the County\r\nDemocracy, Joel B. Erhardt by the Republicans, and James J. Coogan by\r\nthe remnant of the United Labor party. The vote was as follows: Grant,\r\n114,111; Erhardt, 73,037; Hewitt, 71,979; Coogan, 9,809. For Grover\r\nCleveland, whom Tammany had this time supported at the nominating\r\nconvention, the city gave a plurality of 55,831, out of a total vote of\r\nabout 270,000.\r\n\r\nOne of the Tammany men elected was James A. Flack, Grand Sachem of the\r\nsociety (1888-1889), who assumed the duties of Sheriff the following\r\nJanuary. During the same year Flack surreptitiously and fraudulently\r\nobtained a divorce in order to remarry. His wife was the ostensible\r\nplaintiff, but it was shown that she knew nothing of the suit. Flack\r\nand his accomplices were indicted by the Grand Jury, whereupon he was\r\ntried and sentenced to two months in the Tombs prison, and to pay a\r\nfine of $500. The Supreme Court later affirmed the sentence. Some\r\nothers implicated also went to prison. The scandal was such that Flack\r\nwas removed from the Sheriff’s office, and was forced to resign as\r\nGrand Sachem of the society.\r\n\r\nTammany was now in practically complete control, and carried things\r\nwith a high hand. Most of the departments had again become inefficient\r\nand corrupt. On March 21, 1890, the Grand Jury handed down a\r\npresentment stating that the Sheriff’s office, which for twenty years\r\nhad been a hotbed of corruption, had recently been brought into “public\r\nscandal and infamy,” through the growth of notorious abuses; that in\r\n1889 the Sheriff’s net profits had been at least $50,000, not including\r\ncertain “extra compensations that could not be ascertained.” Many other\r\nabuses, the Grand Jury further recited, were found to be connected with\r\nthe management of this office, and also with the conduct of the Ludlow\r\nStreet Jail.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time the State Senate Committee on Cities, headed\r\nby J. Sloat Fassett, a Republican, undertook an investigation. Though\r\nsubjected to the charges of lukewarmness and bargaining, this body,\r\npopularly known as the “Fassett Committee,” brought out much valuable\r\ninformation. Part of its testimony has already been referred to.\r\nIt is impossible even to summarize the vast total embodied in the\r\n3,650 printed pages of its report, but some of the more interesting\r\nparticulars may be briefly touched upon.\r\n\r\nHenry S. Ives and George H. Stayner testified that, while prisoners\r\nat Ludlow Street Jail, they had paid, for various favors, $10,000 to\r\nWarden James P. Keating, then and later a prominent Tammany leader, and\r\nthat previously they had paid other large amounts to certain Deputy\r\nSheriffs.[4]\r\n\r\nJohn F. B. Smyth testified that when Sheriff Grant had appointed\r\nhim Sheriff’s auctioneer--the most valuable gift at the Sheriff’s\r\ndisposal--the latter suggested his having as a partner ex-Alderman Kirk\r\n(one of the Aldermen of 1884 indicted in connection with the Broadway\r\nSurface Railroad franchise),[5] saying that the organization insisted\r\non having “one-half of it [the loot] go to somebody else.” In less than\r\na year the gross proceeds amounted to about $20,000. Of this, $10,000\r\nwent to various Deputy Sheriffs, one of whom was Bernard F. Martin,\r\nfrequently Sachem and another noted Tammany leader.[6]\r\n\r\nA copious amount of similar testimony was brought out implicating many\r\nother Tammany leaders, and showing that the Sheriff’s known income\r\nfrom the office ranged from $60,000 to $75,000 a year.[7] Thomas P.\r\nTaylor, a lawyer, swore that one of his clients in 1888 had had a claim\r\nof about $4,000 in the Sheriff’s hands, and that William H. Clark, a\r\nSachem and a powerful Tammany leader, the partner of W. Bourke Cockran,\r\nand sometime Corporation Counsel, had asked him (Taylor), “what he\r\nwould give to get it.” Mr. Taylor further testified that he had given\r\nnothing, and that he had secured only a few hundred dollars of the\r\namount, after much trouble.[8] Clark denied the charge.[9]\r\n\r\nCorruption, favoritism and blackmail were charged against all the other\r\ndepartments controlled by Tammany, though in the Police and Excise\r\ndepartments, Republican and Tammany commissioners alike were shown to\r\nhave winked at the abuses. Gambling houses had to pay at least $25 a\r\nweek for protection,[10] and revenue was likewise derived from every\r\nplace or person capable of being blackmailed. The testimony strongly\r\npointed to the probability that as much as $10,000 had been paid to get\r\na certain saloon license, though there was no absolute verification of\r\nthe statement.\r\n\r\nOne interesting fact officially brought out--a fact long generally\r\nknown, however, and stated heretofore in this work--was that the\r\nWiskinskie of the Tammany Society, nominally a city employee, was\r\nthe official agent of the organization in collecting assessments,\r\nsaid to vary from 5 to 10 per cent., on the salaries of every Tammany\r\noffice-holder. In fact, Mr. Croker unhesitatingly admitted before the\r\nFassett Committee, that at that time it cost from $50,000 to $75,000 to\r\nrun the organization successfully.[11] Considerable sums were likewise\r\nderived from assessments on candidates. Mr. Hewitt, it was said,\r\ncontributed $12,000 in 1886, but Mr. Croker developed a very poor\r\nmemory when questioned about this and contributions from many Judges\r\nand other office-holders.[12]\r\n\r\nThe revelations, as usual, caused the formation of a citizens’\r\nmovement, and a strong combination of Republicans, Democrats and\r\nindependents was formed, under the name of the “People’s Municipal\r\nLeague,” for the purpose of ousting Tammany. Francis M. Scott, a\r\nDemocrat, was nominated for Mayor, and a vigorous campaign was waged.\r\nTammany minimized the disclosures, and renominated Mr. Grant. A\r\nDemocratic tidal wave swept the nation in the Fall of 1890, and on this\r\nwave the Tammany ticket was carried to victory, the local majority\r\nbeing 23,199.\r\n\r\nThe effect on the society and the organization of this victory,\r\nfollowing so closely upon the Fassett revelations, was to impress the\r\nTammany men with an added sense of security. Accordingly, by tacit\r\nunderstanding, smirches made upon reputations before the Fassett\r\nCommittee were to constitute no bar to political advancement, and the\r\nold condition of things in the departments was to continue. Many of\r\nthose who had suffered most at the hands of the Senatorial inquisitors\r\nwere elected during the next four years to places in the society and\r\nto public offices. Irving Hall and the County Democracy passed out\r\nof existence, and Tammany had full sway. Administrative corruption\r\ncontinued, and frauds at the polls, despite certain improvements in the\r\nballot laws instituted in 1890, developed to a science, reaching their\r\nclimax in 1893.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Tammany fought the nomination of Mr. Cleveland for President,\r\nthough it supported him after his election. Thomas F. Gilroy, Grand\r\nSachem (1892-94) was nominated for Mayor, the Republicans presenting\r\nEdwin Einstein. A Democratic landslide marked the election, and the\r\nTammany candidates won by practically the same majority as that given\r\nto Mr. Cleveland, Mr. Gilroy receiving 173,510, and Mr. Einstein,\r\n97,923 votes. Frauds were numerous, as usual. The opposition vote in a\r\nnumber of election districts was practically nothing. A certain Tammany\r\npolitician, later State Senator from the lower end of town, stood in\r\nthe envious wonder of his fellows for a whole year following, for\r\nhaving secured for the ticket all the votes but four in his election\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe fame of this enterprising worker aroused a determination in the\r\nbreasts of others to exceed his record. During the next campaign\r\n(1893) the general indignation against the corrupt conduct of Judge\r\nMaynard, brought out a strong opposition to his elevation to the bench\r\nof the Court of Appeals. Senator Hill caused his nomination, Tammany\r\nsupported him, and the word was passed around that he must be elected\r\nat all hazards. As a consequence, frauds of the gravest character\r\nwere committed throughout the city. The Tammany leader of the Second\r\nAssembly District, zealous to outdo the record of the previous year,\r\noffered prizes to his election district captains for the best results.\r\nThe election overturned all known records. The successful competitor\r\nbrought in a poll of 369 to 0. In two other precincts no opposition\r\nvotes of any kind were counted, despite the presence of Republican\r\ninspectors, and the fact that Republicans, Socialists, Populists and\r\nProhibitionists afterward swore under oath that they had voted for\r\ntheir respective candidates. The vote in this assembly district,\r\nnominally 8,000, rose to nearly 13,000.\r\n\r\nA committee from the Populist County Committee, the local branch of\r\nthe National People’s party, immediately took steps to secure evidence\r\nthrough which to effect the punishment of the lawbreakers.[13] The\r\nevidence secured, with that afterwards obtained by the Republican\r\nCounty Committee, the City Club, the Good Government clubs, and the Bar\r\nAssociation, was submitted to the Grand Jury, upon which some sixty\r\nindictments were handed down. A number of convictions were obtained,\r\nand several Tammany and assistant Tammany election officers were sent\r\nto prison. The Tammany leader of the Second Assembly District went to\r\nCalifornia immediately after the agitation began, and remained there\r\nuntil the affair blew over. In the election the following year the vote\r\nof this district fell to the old figures of approximately 8,000.\r\n\r\nThe city had again become scandalously corrupt. The bi-partizan\r\nboards, which originally had been established in the hope of applying\r\nsome check to the general rascality, had merely furnished greater\r\nopportunities for deals and political bargaining. Charges of blackmail,\r\nextortion, of immunity given to crime, and most other forms of\r\nadministrative venality, grew so common that again the State Senate\r\nsent (April, 1894), a committee to the city to investigate. This was\r\nthe body commonly known as the “Lexow Committee,” from its chairman,\r\nClarence Lexow. Its counsel, John W. Goff, vigorously conducted the\r\ninvestigation, and the result was a mass of information regarding\r\nTammany methods of government such as the public had not known since\r\nthe exposures of Tweed’s time. We can but touch upon the testimony.\r\n\r\nIt was shown that during each of the years 1891, 1892 and 1893, many\r\nthousands of fraudulent ballots had been cast by the active cooperation\r\nand connivance of the police; Police Captains were appointed from\r\nthose members of the force who especially connived at these frauds,\r\nthe appointments being made by the President of the Board of Police\r\n(who was one of the most conspicuous Wigwam leaders) at the instance of\r\nthe organization. Tammany influences permeated the Police Department\r\nto such a degree that the district leaders dictated appointments, and\r\nfrom Captain down almost the entire force joined the Tammany district\r\nassociations. Forced contributions were levied upon the members for the\r\nbenefit of Wigwam district organizations.\r\n\r\nCapt. Creedon confessed to paying $15,000 to secure a promotion to a\r\nCaptaincy, and Capt. Schmittberger, to having secured the appointment\r\nof another man as Captain, in consideration of the payment of $12,000.\r\nThe average cost of obtaining an appointment as policeman was $300.\r\nThe police functionaries recouped themselves in various ways. Vice and\r\ncrime were protected openly. One woman who kept a number of houses of\r\nill-repute testified that she had paid continuously for protection an\r\naggregate of $30,000 or more. The system reached such a perfection\r\nin detail that a ratable charge was placed upon each house according\r\nto the number of inmates, the protection prices ranging from $25 to\r\n$50 monthly. Women of the streets paid patrolmen for permission to\r\nsolicit, and divided proceeds. Visitors were robbed systematically, and\r\nthe plunder was divided with the police. More than 600 policy shops\r\npaid at the monthly rate of $15, while pool rooms paid $300 a month.\r\nIt was noted by the committee, as a remarkable fact, that when public\r\nagitation grew very strong, a private citizen, Richard Croker, secured\r\nthe closing of these places practically in a single day. Every form of\r\ngambling had to pay high prices for immunity. Green goods swindlers\r\nwere required to make monthly payments, to subdivide the city into\r\ndistricts, and additionally, in case the victim “squealed,” to give\r\none-half of the plunder to either ward or headquarters detectives.\r\nSaloons paid $20 monthly, according “to the established custom.” The\r\npolice also acted in collusion with thieves and dishonest pawnbrokers.\r\nAlmost every branch of trade and commerce was forced to make monthly\r\npayments, and from every possible source tribute was wrung.\r\n\r\nThe committee incorporated in its testimony the estimate of Foreman\r\nTabor, of the Grand Jury, in March, 1892, that the annual income\r\nderived from blackmailing and different sources of extortion was\r\n$7,000,000.[14] In this estimate there were probably not included the\r\nlarge sums paid by corporations of every kind, and all who sought the\r\nfavor or feared the power of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nThe two Democratic members of the Police Board at this time were\r\nJames J. Martin, one of the powerful district leaders, and John C.\r\nSheehan, who became deputy “boss” during Mr. Croker’s absence. No\r\ndirect evidence was given to establish their complicity in the general\r\nextortion, but John McClave, the Republican Commissioner, resigned\r\nafter a searching and pointed examination.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker did not testify before the Lexow Committee, urgent business\r\ndemanding his presence in England throughout the investigation.\r\n\r\nThe public was aroused as it had not been since 1871. An earnest\r\nagitation for reform, largely due to the crusade of Rev. Charles H.\r\nParkhurst, and to the work of the City Club and the Good Government\r\nclubs, was begun. A Committee of Seventy, composed of representatives\r\nof all classes, was formed to carry on a political contest, and an\r\nenthusiastic support was given to it by the great mass of the public\r\nthroughout the campaign. William L. Strong, a Republican and a\r\nprominent dry goods merchant, was nominated by the Seventy for Mayor,\r\nand the Republicans indorsed him. Tammany, after floundering about for\r\nseveral weeks in the vain hope of securing a candidate strong enough to\r\nstem the opposing tide, selected at first Nathan Straus, who withdrew,\r\nand then Hugh J. Grant, making its campaign largely on the ground\r\nthat Mr. Grant was the only unsmirched Tammany member of the “Boodle”\r\nBoard of Aldermen of 1884. The contest was bitter and determined on\r\nboth sides, Tammany putting forth its utmost efforts to avert the\r\ninevitable disaster. According to a statement of John C. Sheehan, the\r\norganization expended more money in this election than in any election\r\nin recent years.\r\n\r\nThe convictions of the previous year had served to cool the zeal of\r\nthe Tammany workers for records at the polls. In consequence of this,\r\nand of further changes in the manner of balloting, New York enjoyed\r\nprobably the most fairly conducted election of any since the first\r\norganized effort of Tammany men at the polls in 1800. Strong was\r\nelected by a majority of 45,187. With his election went nearly the\r\nwhole of the city patronage, changes in the new constitution (1894)\r\nhaving greatly centralized the city’s administrative functions in the\r\nMayor’s hands. Tammany was thus thrust out again.\r\n\r\nMayor Strong’s administration on the whole was beneficial. The city\r\nbudget went up to nearly $44,000,000, but for the first time since\r\nMayor Havemeyer’s time the streets were kept clean--a result due to the\r\nsystematic energy of Col. George E. Waring, Jr. Moreover, new schools\r\nwere built, new parks laid out, streets asphalted, improvements planned\r\nand carried out, while administrative corruption was almost unheard\r\nof. Not the least of the benefits of this administration was the\r\npartial reform of the Police Department, through the efforts of Police\r\nCommissioner Theodore Roosevelt, and his fellow Commissioners, Avery D.\r\nAndrews, Andrew D. Parker and Frank Moss.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Richard Croker spent most of his time in England.\r\nFrom being a comparatively poor man, as he testified in 1890, he\r\nbecame suddenly rich. From April, 1889, to February, 1890, he was City\r\nChamberlain, at a salary of $25,000 a year, but thereafter he held no\r\npublic office. Within two years, however, he was able, according to\r\ncommon report, to buy an interest in the Belle Meade stock farm for\r\n$250,000, paying additionally $109,000 for Longstreet and other race\r\nhorses. Later, he built a new house, said to cost over $200,000, and\r\nlavishly spent money, and displayed the evidences of wealth in other\r\nways.\r\n\r\nWhen in the city he was, for a considerable number of years, in the\r\nreal estate business. He is popularly credited with having been\r\ninterested in the passage and development of certain extremely valuable\r\nfranchises which were obtained from the Legislature and Board of\r\nAldermen for almost nothing. In 1892 he was reputed to dominate the\r\nLegislature, as he did the city, and the lobby disappeared. It was\r\nrelated at the time that all applicants for favors or for relief from\r\nhostile measures were advised “to see headquarters.”\r\n\r\nOne of the franchises granted during that year was the “Huckleberry\r\nfranchise,” for a street railway in the Annexed District--a grant which\r\nwas worth at the time fully $2,000,000, and yet was practically given\r\naway under circumstances of great scandal.[15] When testifying before\r\nthe Mazet Committee in 1899, he was asked whether he had owned, in\r\n1892, 800 shares of the stock of this road, but declined to state.[16]\r\nAnother illustration of Mr. Croker’s alleged diversified interests was\r\nfurnished by a statement said to have been inspired by John C. Sheehan\r\nand published on December 23, 1900. Mr. Sheehan asserted that in 1894\r\nhe and Mr. Croker were interested in a company formed with a capital\r\nof $5,000,000 for the construction of the rapid transit tunnel. Mr.\r\nSheehan, the statement read, forced through the Board of Aldermen a\r\nresolution approving the tunnel route which he and Mr. Croker had\r\nselected as the most feasible. The statement further set forth that\r\nMr. Croker had $500,000 worth of this company’s stock, which came to\r\nhim gratuitously, and that he and Mr. Sheehan had been also mutually\r\ninterested in a proposed surety company.\r\n\r\nAs chairman of the finance committee of Tammany Hall (a post Tweed\r\nand Kelly had held, and which carried with it the titular leadership\r\nof the organization), all the vast funds contributed for Tammany’s\r\nmany campaigns passed through his hands. As he himself testified, the\r\nfinance committee kept no books.[17]\r\n\r\nWhether Mr. Croker was at home or far abroad, his control of the Wigwam\r\nwas absolute. Long since, he had inaugurated the system of “turning\r\ndown” any man that disobeyed orders.\r\n\r\nAt the time of Mr. Bryan’s nomination, in 1896, Mr. Croker was in\r\nEngland. His three years’ racing experience there cost him, it was\r\nreported, between $600,000 and $700,000. He remained abroad, leaving\r\nthe organization, as we have mentioned, in charge of John C. Sheehan\r\nas a kind of vicegerent. Mr. Sheehan’s public record in Buffalo had\r\nbeen severely criticized, and many organization men had protested\r\nagainst his being put in charge. This protest, however, was generally\r\nunderstood at the time to be founded not so much on the matter of Mr.\r\nSheehan’s record as on that of his being an interloper from another\r\nsection of the State. Tammany that year ignored the national Democratic\r\nplatform. Though ratifying Mr. Bryan’s nomination, a general apathy\r\nprevailed at the Wigwam throughout the campaign, and the more radical\r\nDemocrats repeatedly charged the leaders with treachery to the ticket.\r\nThe result of this apathy and of other influences was that Mr. McKinley\r\ncarried the city by over 20,000 plurality.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker finally returned home in September, 1897, shortly before the\r\nmeeting of the Democratic city convention. It was commonly believed\r\nthat Mr. Sheehan, the deputy “boss,” had made preparations to assume\r\nthe “boss-ship” himself, but Mr. Sheehan emphatically denied this.\r\nWhatever the circumstances were Mr. Croker promptly deprived the former\r\nof power, and later succeeded in practically excluding him from the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nThe “Boss’s” supreme control of city politics was illustrated by the\r\nnomination for Mayor of Greater New York of Robert C. Van Wyck, who\r\nwas in no sense the organization’s candidate, but represented merely\r\nMr. Croker’s choice and dictation. The Citizens’ Union nominated Seth\r\nLow, who probably would have been elected had the Republicans indorsed\r\nhim. But the latter nominated Benjamin F. Tracy, thus dividing the\r\nopposition, which was still further disintegrated by the action of\r\nthe Jeffersonian Democrats in nominating Henry George, and later\r\nHenry George, Jr., upon the noted economist dying in the heat of the\r\ncampaign. The canvass was carried on with the greatest vigor, for under\r\nthe Greater New York charter all the territory now embraced in the\r\ncity limits was to vote for one Mayor, with a four-years’ term, and\r\nalmost dictatorial power in the matter of appointments and removals.\r\nIn his statement, heretofore referred to, Mr. Sheehan asserted that\r\nduring this campaign he personally collected and turned over to John\r\nMcQuade,[18] the treasurer of Tammany Hall, the sum of $260,000,\r\nirrespective of contributions collected by others, and that at the end\r\nof the canvass Mr. McQuade had $50,000 in the treasury.[19]\r\n\r\nThe vote stood: Van Wyck, 253,997; Low, 151,540; Tracy, 101,863;\r\nGeorge, 21,693; scattering, 17,464. The Wigwam was beside itself with\r\njoy; the victory meant absolute control of the greater city’s annual\r\nbudget of over $90,000,000, not to speak of the tens of millions more\r\nderived from rents, fees, fines, interest, assessments for street\r\nimprovements, bond sales and premiums, and from those vast and varied\r\nsources of contract juggling, selling of legislative “goods,” and\r\nall the other avenues, too numerous to enumerate, of which Tammany\r\nfrom early times has availed itself. It also meant the control of an\r\narmy of employees, now estimated at 60,000. The disreputable classes\r\nvociferously celebrated the occasion, assured that the town was once\r\nmore to be “wide open.”\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, 1890, Vol. II, pp. 1708-12.\r\n\r\n[2] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, 1890, Vol. I, pp. 707-8.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, pp. 745-50, and _Ibid._, Vol. II, p. 1701.\r\n\r\n[4] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, 1890, Vol. I, pp. 235-52,\r\nand _Ibid._, p. 300.\r\n\r\n[5] Kirk had been dropped from the Council of Sachems in 1886 owing to\r\nthe disclosures.\r\n\r\n[6] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, 1890, Vol. I, pp. 282-87.\r\nBernard, or “Barney,” Martin and two others had been indicted on the\r\nground of having been bribed, but the indictments were dismissed in\r\nMarch, 1890, on a technicality which allowed the defendants to fall\r\nback upon the Statute of Limitations.\r\n\r\n[7] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, 1890, Vol. I, p. 344.\r\n\r\n[8] _Ibid._, pp. 502-11.\r\n\r\n[9] _Ibid._, p. 513.\r\n\r\n[10] _Ibid._, Vol. II, p. 1244.\r\n\r\n[11] _Testimony, Senate Committee on Cities_, Vol. II, p. 1756.\r\n\r\n[12] _Ibid._, pp. 1757-62.\r\n\r\n[13] The credit for instituting this prosecution has been variously,\r\nand sometimes impudently, claimed.

The testimony brought out in the\r\ncase of Henry A. Smalley _vs._ The Mayor, etc., before Judge Donohue,\r\nin the Supreme Court, January 28, 1878, showed that the value of all\r\nthe material used in the building was $66,386, but that the Finance\r\nDepartment had paid out for this material $268,580.\r\n\r\n[19] Early in 1898 Tammany Hall, with considerable display, disposed\r\nof most of this fund, by giving $20,000 for the poor of the city and a\r\nlike sum for the Cuban cause.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nTHE DICTATORSHIP OF RICHARD CROKER (_Concluded_)\r\n\r\n1897-1901\r\n\r\n\r\nNow that Tammany was reinstalled in almost absolute power, Mr. Croker\r\nset about choosing the important city officials to be appointed by\r\nthe Mayor. He frankly admitted before the Mazet Committee, in 1899,\r\nthat practically all of them were selected by him or his immediate\r\nassociates. Requiring a routine assistant in the work of “bossing,”\r\nMr. Croker selected John F. Carroll, who thereupon resigned the\r\noffice of Clerk of the Court of General Sessions, which yielded, it\r\nwas estimated, about $12,000 a year, to take a post with no apparent\r\nsalary. Mr. Croker then returned to horse-racing in England.\r\n\r\nThe public pronouncements of the organization continued to voice the\r\nold-time characteristic pretensions of that body’s frugality, honesty\r\nand submission to the popular will. In October, 1898, the county\r\nconvention in the Wigwam passed resolutions commending “the wise,\r\nhonest and economical” Tammany administration of Greater New York, and\r\ndenouncing the “corruption, extravagance and waste of the infamous\r\nmismanagement” by the previous reform administration. Yet at this very\r\nmoment the Bar Association was protesting against Mr. Croker’s refusal\r\nto renominate Judge Joseph F. Daly,[1] on the ground of his refusing\r\nto hand over the patronage of his court. The convention itself, despite\r\nits fine words, acted merely as the register of the will of one man,\r\nwith scarcely the formality of a contest; and the public had again\r\nbecome agitated over the certainty of grave scandals in the public\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nTammany’s election fund this year was generally reputed to be in the\r\nneighborhood of $100,000. As much as $500 was spent in each of several\r\nhotly contested election districts. Tammany won, but by a margin\r\nless than had been expected and, in fact, arranged for. The State\r\nSuperintendent of Elections, John McCullough, in his annual report\r\n(January, 1899) to Gov. Roosevelt, gave good grounds for believing\r\nthat Tammany had been deprived of a large support on which it had\r\ncounted. Of 13,104 persons registered from specified lodging houses in\r\ncertain strong Tammany districts, only 4,034 voted. It was evident that\r\ncolonization frauds on a large scale had been attempted, and had been\r\nfrustrated only by the vigilance of Superintendent McCullough.\r\n\r\nThe state of administrative affairs in the city grew worse and worse,\r\nnearly approximating that of 1893-94. The Legislature again determined\r\nto investigate, and accordingly sent to the city the special committee\r\nof the Assembly, popularly known as the “Mazet Committee.” This body’s\r\nprestige suffered from the charge that its investigation was unduly\r\npartizan. Moreover, it was generally felt by the public that its work\r\nwas inefficiently carried on. Nevertheless, it produced a considerable\r\narray of facts showing the existence of gross maladministration.\r\n\r\nIt was disclosed that every member of the Tammany Society or of the\r\norganization’s executive committee, held office, or was a favored\r\ncontractor. Over $700,000 of city orders went to favored contractors\r\nwithout bidding. Various city departments were “characterized by\r\nunparalleled ignorance and unfairness.” The payrolls in some of the\r\nmost important departments had increased $1,500,000 between July 1,\r\n1898, and September 1, 1899, and the employees had increased over\r\n1,000, excluding policemen, firemen and teachers. The testimony proved\r\nthe increasing inefficiency and demoralization of the Police and Fire\r\nDepartments. It further proved the existence of a ramified system of\r\ncorruption similar to that revealed by the Lexow Committee.\r\n\r\nThe disclosures attracting the greatest public attention were those\r\nrelating to the Ice Trust, the Ramapo project, and Mr. Croker’s\r\nrelations to the city government. On April 14 the committee exposed a\r\nconspiracy between the Ice Trust and the Dock and other departments\r\nof the city government, to create and maintain a monopoly of New\r\nYork’s ice supply. Six days after the exposure, Mayor Van Wyck, as he\r\nsubsequently admitted in his testimony before Judge Gaynor, acquired\r\n5,000 shares, worth $500,000, of the Ice Trust stock, alleging that he\r\npaid $57,000 in cash for them; but although urged to substantiate his\r\nstatement, did not produce proof that he actually paid anything. It was\r\nshown conclusively before the committee that the arrangement between\r\nthe Ice Trust and the city officials was such as to compel the people\r\nto pay 60 cents a hundred pounds, and that the trust had stopped the\r\nsale of five-cent pieces of ice, practically cutting off the supply\r\nof the very poor. Many other Tammany officials were equally involved.\r\nProceedings were begun some time after, looking to an official\r\ninvestigation of the Ice Trust’s affairs, and charges against Mayor Van\r\nWyck were filed with Gov. Roosevelt. The latter were finally dismissed\r\nby the Governor in November, 1900.\r\n\r\nIn August, the committee uncovered the Ramapo scheme. The Ramapo Water\r\nCompany, with assets “of at least the value of $5,000,” sought to foist\r\nupon the city a contract calling for payment from the city treasury\r\nof an enormous amount in annual installments of about $5,110,000,\r\nin return for at least 200,000,000 gallons of water a day, at $70\r\nper million gallons. This was proved to be an attempt toward a most\r\ngigantic swindle. Had not Controller Coler exposed and frustrated the\r\nscheme, the Tammany members of the Board of Public Improvements would\r\nhave rushed the contract to passage.\r\n\r\nMr. Croker’s testimony threw a flood of light upon his political\r\nviews and standards as well as his powers and emoluments as “boss.”\r\nHe acknowledged that he had a powerful influence over the Tammany\r\nlegislators at Albany, whose actions he advised, and that he exercised\r\nthe same influence upon local officials. He readily conceded that he\r\nwas the most powerful man he knew of.[2] “We try to have a pretty\r\neffective organization,” he said; “that is what we are there for.”[3]\r\n\r\nMr. Croker also admitted that judicial candidates were assessed in\r\ntheir districts.[4] In fact, some of the Judges themselves named the\r\nrespective sums to the committee. Judge Pryor testified that he had\r\nbeen asked for $10,000 for his nomination for a vacant half-term in\r\nthe Supreme Court.[5] Other judicial candidates, it was understood,\r\npaid from $10,000 to $25,000 for nominations.[6] Mr. Croker maintained\r\nthat the organization was entitled to all the judicial, executive,\r\nadministrative--in brief, all offices--because “that is what the\r\npeople voted our ticket for.”[7] Mr. Croker refused to answer many\r\nquestions tending to show that he profited by a silent partnership in\r\nmany companies which benefited directly or indirectly by his power.\r\n“The man who is virtual ruler of the city,” said Frank Moss and\r\nFrancis E. Laimbeer, counsel to the committee, in their report, “can\r\ninsure peace and advantage and business to any concern that takes him\r\nand his friends in, and can secure capital here or abroad to float\r\nany enterprise, when he guarantees that the city officials will not\r\ninterfere with it.” Mr. Croker was asked many other questions touching\r\nthis subject, but gave little information. He declined to answer the\r\nquestion whether $140,000 of the stock of the Auto-Truck Company had\r\nbeen given to him without the payment of a dollar; it was his “private\r\naffair.”[8]\r\n\r\n“We are giving the people pure organization government,” he said. He\r\nreferred to the thoroughness of discipline in the Wigwam, and stated\r\nthat the only way to succeed was to keep the whip in hand over his\r\nhenchmen. It took “a lot of time,” and he “had to work very hard\r\nat it.” Tammany was built up, he said, not only upon the political\r\nprinciples it held, but upon the way its members sustained one another\r\nin business. “We want the whole business, if we can get it”; “to the\r\nparty belong the spoils”; “we win, and we expect every one to stand\r\nby us”; “I am working for my pocket all the time,” were some of Mr.\r\nCroker’s answers, most of them told in anything but grammatical English.\r\n\r\nThe general opinion obtained that the committee’s work would have been\r\nfar more effective and free from charges of partizan bias if Thomas\r\nC. Platt, the Republican “boss,” had been summoned concerning his\r\nalleged political connection with the great corporations and financial\r\ninterests, as Mr. Croker had been.\r\n\r\nApparently the disclosures made no deep impression on the city\r\nadministration, for matters went along pretty much as before. On March\r\n9, 1900, the New York _Times_ published a detailed statement, which\r\nit later reiterated, that the sum of $3,095,000 a year was being paid\r\nby the gambling-house keepers of the city to the “gambling-house\r\ncommission,” which, it said, was composed of two State Senators, a\r\nrepresentative of the poolroom proprietors, and the head of one of the\r\ncity departments. This commission, the account stated, received and\r\npassed upon applications, established the tariff to be paid by the\r\napplicants, and supervised the collections. Later, in the same month,\r\nthe Grand Jury handed down a presentment arraigning the city officials\r\nfor the sway enjoyed by the criminal and vicious classes.[9]\r\n\r\nNeither the Grand Jury’s presentment nor the _Times’s_ detailed\r\nstatements had the slightest effect on the conduct of the city\r\nadministration. In November, however, a marked change occurred. For\r\nseveral years certain reform societies and ecclesiastical bodies,\r\nparticularly the Episcopal Church, had sought to mitigate the open\r\nflaunting of immorality in the tenement houses of a particular police\r\ndistrict on the East Side. The attempts had been resisted, not only by\r\nthose living upon the proceeds of this immorality, but by the police\r\nthemselves; and two ministers who had complained to certain police\r\nofficials had been grossly insulted.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the Presidential election, Bishop Henry C. Potter,\r\nof the Episcopal Church, in a stinging letter of complaint, brought\r\nthe matter to the attention of Mayor Van Wyck. It was the psychologic\r\nmoment for such an action, and it produced immediate results. Mr.\r\nCroker paused in his preparations for his usual trip to England long\r\nenough to give orders to put down the immorality complained of, and he\r\nappointed a committee of five to carry his mandate into effect, or at\r\nleast to make some satisfactory show of doing so. He went further than\r\nthis, for his orders included a general ukase to the lawbreakers of the\r\ncity to “go slow,” or in other words, to observe, until further advices\r\nfrom headquarters, a certain degree of moderation in their infractions\r\nof law and their outrages upon decency.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] Tweed testified in 1877 that Joseph F. Daly, with two others,\r\nconstituted the sole membership of the “Citizens’ Association” of 1870,\r\nand that he had placated the three men by giving them offices, Mr. Daly\r\nsecuring a Judgeship of the Court of Common Pleas.\r\n\r\n[2] _Stenographic minutes_, p. 451.\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, p. 465.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._, p. 6806.\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid._, p. 523.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._, pp. 6891, etc.\r\n\r\n[7] _Ibid._, p. 464.\r\n\r\n[8] _Stenographic minutes_, p. 683.\r\n\r\n[9] On December 22, 1900, Gov. Roosevelt removed Asa Bird Gardiner,\r\nthe Tammany District Attorney, who was popularly credited with having\r\noriginated the phrase, “To hell with reform,” for having encouraged the\r\nturbulent element to open resistance of the law at the election. Eugene\r\nA. Philbin, an independent Democrat, was appointed his successor. The\r\nlatter promptly demanded the resignations of many of Mr. Gardiner’s\r\nassistants. Before his election Gardiner had long been chairman of the\r\nTammany Hall Legal Committee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTAMMANY UNDER ABSENTEE DIRECTION\r\n\r\n1901-1902\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the municipal campaign of 1901 the anti-Tammany forces combined\r\nupon the nomination of Seth Low, a Republican, for Mayor, and upon the\r\nnominations of various other candidates for city offices. Tammany’s\r\ncandidate for Mayor was Edward M. Shepard. Both Mr. Low and Mr. Shepard\r\nwere acclaimed by their respective supporters as men of standing,\r\nprestige and public character. Mr. Low was a man of wealth who had\r\nbecome president of Columbia University. Mr. Shepard was a lawyer of\r\nnote, although some critics pointed out that his practise was that of\r\na corporation attorney, serving the great vested interests. It may\r\nbe remarked that Mr. Shepard was a son of the brilliant Lorenzo B.\r\nShepard, who, as stated in Chapter XVI of this work, became a leader\r\nof Tammany Hall at so early an age and was chosen Grand Sachem of the\r\nTammany Society.\r\n\r\nThe scandals of Mayor Van Wyck’s administration were conspicuous issues\r\nof the campaign of 1901. But there were two particularly noteworthy\r\nfeatures pressed by the reformers in their indictment of Tammany. One\r\nof these issues, which made so deep an impression upon the public mind,\r\nespecially in the densely populous East Side of New York City, was the\r\nflagrant immorality under which young girls of the tenderest age were\r\noften decoyed into lives of shame. The question thus presented was\r\nneither that of the “suppression of vice” nor that of how people could\r\nbe made virtuous by mandate of law. The question, as put to voters,\r\nwas whether a system under which a corrupt, money-making combination of\r\nvicious lawbreakers with police and other officials should be allowed\r\nto continue in abhorrent traffic.\r\n\r\nA widely-circulated pamphlet published by the City Club for the\r\nWomen’s Municipal League presented a series of facts as attested by\r\ncourt records, the statements of City Magistrates, the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Children and others, and as reported by the\r\nCommittee of Fifteen, composed of reformers, probing into the question.\r\nThe pamphlet declared that the facts justified the conclusion that the\r\nbusiness of ruining young girls and forcing them into a life of shame,\r\nfor the money there was in it for the dealers, had recently grown to\r\nconsiderable proportions; that its existence was known to the police;\r\nthat the police made little or no effort to stop it; that the police,\r\nor those for whom they acted, probably derived profit from the traffic;\r\nand that a reasonably active and efficient Police Department could\r\nstop the traffic of a deliberate merchandizing of the virtue of women,\r\nusually young girls. Details were given of numerous cases which had\r\nbeen passed upon in the courts, and a long description of the traffic\r\nwas included from a statement made on October 21, 1901, by District\r\nAttorney Eugene A. Philbin of New York County.[1]\r\n\r\nJustice William Travers Jerome, of the Court of Special Sessions,\r\nhad already made a similar statement. He was quoted in the New York\r\n_Times_, of June 27, 1901, as saying:\r\n\r\n    “People are simply ignorant of conditions on the East Side\r\n    [of New York City]. If those conditions existed in some other\r\n    communities there would be a Vigilance Committee speedily\r\n    organized, and somebody would get lynched. The continued greed\r\n    and extortion of the Police Captains who charge five hundred\r\n    dollars for a disorderly resort to open in their precinct,\r\n    and then collect fifty to a hundred [dollars] per month, has,\r\n    however, made even vice unprofitable. Details, I know, are\r\n    revolting and not nice to read, but yet the people ought to\r\n    know about them. Just yesterday I sentenced to six months in\r\n    the penitentiary the keepers of one of the most depraved houses\r\n    of the East Side. I firmly believe that they were merely the\r\n    agents of the man who owns not one but many of such places. He\r\n    is well known as a politician in a certain notorious district.\r\n\r\n    “That house is but one of hundreds within a radius of one mile\r\n    of this building [the Criminal Court House] where criminals\r\n    are sometimes brought to justice. I will stake my reputation\r\n    that there are scores within less than that distance from here\r\n    in which there are an average of ten or twelve children from\r\n    thirteen to eighteen years old.”[2]\r\n\r\nNominated for District Attorney of New York County by the anti-Tammany\r\nforces, Mr. Jerome’s speeches on these existing conditions made a\r\nkeen impression and excited the deepest feeling, especially among the\r\npeople of the East Side. Intricate questions of taxation and arrays\r\nof figures proving an exorbitant budget and the waste of public funds\r\ncould not make the same appeal to their indignation as the portrayal of\r\nconditions menacing their home life and polluting their environment.\r\nThe facts thus spread forth caused the most intense resentment against\r\nTammany.\r\n\r\nIn reply Tammany Hall sought to represent that the traffic thus\r\ndescribed was largely mythical--and that at all events it was greatly\r\nexaggerated. It was no fiction, however, nor was police connivance\r\nand corruption a fiction, either. So far as the open flaunting of\r\nvicious conditions was concerned, Tammany Hall had itself been forced\r\nto recognize them; as a concession to public opinion Mr. Croker had,\r\nin November, 1900, appointed an Anti-Vice Committee with orders to\r\ninvestigate vice conditions and “clean up” the “Red Light” district.\r\nTo impart a tone of good faith to the work of this committee, he had\r\nappointed Lewis Nixon, a naval academy graduate and a ship builder,\r\nits chairman. It was generally understood that this committee had\r\nbeen created as a clever campaign move to offset in the public mind\r\nthe growing indignation against Tammany, many of the leaders of\r\nwhich, it was notorious, had profited richly from the system of police\r\n“protection” of vice.\r\n\r\nIn respect to the “white slave” traffic, however, it must be said, in\r\njustice to Tammany, that the factors attributed were not the only ones\r\nresponsible, and such a traffic was far from being confined to New York\r\nCity; it went on in other cities under Republican and Reform as well\r\nas Democratic rule. This was conclusively shown later by the necessity\r\nof the passage of a law passed by Congress aimed at the traffic (a\r\nlaw subsequently diverted somewhat from its original purpose), and by\r\nofficial investigations and court proceedings. The large number of\r\nprosecutions in the Federal courts under that law showed the widespread\r\ncharacter of the traffic.\r\n\r\nAnother important issue of the municipal campaign of 1901 was the\r\nscandal growing out of the charges that William C. Whitney, Thomas F.\r\nRyan, W. L. Elkins, P. A. B. Widener, Thomas Dolan and associates had\r\nlooted the stockholders of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company of\r\nNew York City of tens of millions of dollars. Whitney and Ryan were\r\ncredited with being among the chief financial powers long controlling\r\n“Boss” Croker; and by means of his control of Tammany Hall, and in turn\r\nNew York City, securing franchises, privileges and rights of enormous\r\nvalue. This control was often equally true of the New York State\r\nlegislature; subsequent developments, in fact, revealed that in years\r\nwhen the Legislature was dominantly Republican and therefore could not\r\nbe ordered by Mr. Croker, both Republican and Democratic legislators\r\nwere corrupted by the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, or by agents\r\nacting for it.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. W. N. Amory,[3] who was thoroughly familiar with\r\nthe affairs of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, and who\r\nexposed its looting, Mr. Jerome knew, in 1901, “that the conduct\r\nof Metropolitan affairs was corrupt. We had on numerous occasions\r\ndiscussed that point.”\r\n\r\nMr. Jerome made profuse public promises that if he were elected\r\nDistrict Attorney he would press investigation. “Let me tell you,” he\r\nsaid at the conclusion of a speech on October 26, 1901, “that if I am\r\nelected I shall make it my business to follow the trail of wrongdoing\r\nand corruption not only when they lead into tenement houses, but I\r\nshall follow them even if they lead into the office of the Metropolitan\r\nStreet Railway Company.” Mr. Jerome added: “No one knows better than I\r\ndo that when I am attacking the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, I\r\nam arraying myself against the most dangerous, the most vindictive and\r\nthe most powerful influences at work in this community.”[4]\r\n\r\nMr. Jerome’s denunciations and promises aroused great enthusiasm and\r\nlarge expectations; they had much effect in contributing to the result\r\nof the campaign, for it was popularly realized that while Tammany\r\nleaders accumulated their millions of dollars, yet back of these\r\nleaders, and secretly operating through them, were magnates of great\r\nfinancial power with their tens or hundreds of millions of dollars\r\nacquired largely by means of financial and industrial power conferred\r\nby legislation, permissory or statute, of various kinds. The electorate\r\nwell knew that comparatively small grafters were numerous, but now it\r\nhad the promise that the large spoliators, hitherto immune, would be\r\nexposed and prosecuted, if possible.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election was that Mr. Low was elected Mayor by a\r\nplurality of 31,636. Nearly all of the other anti-Tammany candidates\r\nfor the large offices were also elected, although Tammany’s candidate\r\nfor the Borough of the Bronx--Louis F. Haffen--was successful. The\r\ntotal vote stood: Low, 296,813; Shepard, 265,177. For other political\r\nparties, a small vote was cast: Benjamin Hanford, candidate for\r\nMayor of the Social Democratic party, received 9,834 votes; Keinard,\r\nSocialist Labor candidate for Mayor, polled 6,213 votes, and Manierre,\r\nProhibition candidate for Mayor, 1,264 votes.\r\n\r\nThat of a total vote of 561,990 votes cast for the two chief opposing\r\ncandidates, Tammany and its allied organizations should have polled\r\n265,177 votes, showed Tammany Hall’s enormous strength, even in the\r\nface of a combination of opponents, with all the strength of definite\r\nissues obviously putting Tammany on the defensive.\r\n\r\nRealizing that the attacks upon him personally as the “boss” of Tammany\r\nHall and of the city had been successful in a political sense, Mr.\r\nCroker wisely concluded, immediately after this defeat, to obscure\r\nhimself and give an appearance of retiring from active participation in\r\nthe affairs of Tammany Hall. Conscious, too, of the public discredit\r\nattaching to Tammany methods and Tammany leaders, he saw that the time\r\nhad come to inject some show of an element of respectability and reform\r\ninto Tammany Hall. He now underwent the formalities of an “abdication.”\r\n\r\nOn January 13, 1902, the astonishing news was made public that he\r\nhad selected Lewis Nixon as his successor as the leader of Tammany\r\nHall. Mr. Nixon, at this time, was forty-one years old; hailing from\r\nLeesburg, Virginia, he had been graduated from the United States\r\nNaval Academy, and had become a naval constructor, later owning his\r\nown naval ship plant at Elizabeth, New Jersey. He was also connected\r\nwith a number of private corporations. In 1898 he had been appointed\r\nby Mayor Van Wyck to the office of President of the East River Bridge\r\nCommission, and in 1900-1901 had acted, as we have seen, as Chairman of\r\nMr. Croker’s Anti-Vice Committee.\r\n\r\nWhen the educated Mr. Nixon assumed what he styled the leadership of\r\nTammany Hall, not only seasoned politicians of all grades but also the\r\nsophisticated smiled skeptically. Tammany district leaders maintained\r\nin public an air of profound gravity and obedient acquiescence which\r\ncaused general amusement. And when Mr. Nixon solemnly discussed his\r\nplans for the improvement of Tammany Hall, he was popularly regarded\r\nas an innocent. Even when Mr. Croker, as an apparent token of good\r\nfaith, made Mr. Nixon chairman of the Tammany Finance Committee,\r\nfew considered his appointment seriously; he was generally dubbed\r\n“the phantom leader.” Having attended to Mr. Nixon’s installation,\r\nMr. Croker sailed abroad to his estate at Wantage; to all nominal\r\nappearances he had severed himself from Tammany politics.\r\n\r\nThis comedy lasted but a few months. On May 14, 1902, Mr. Nixon sent\r\nhis resignation as leader to the Tammany Hall Executive Committee. He\r\naccompanied his resignation with a speech in which he declared that\r\nsince he had become chairman of the Tammany Hall Finance Committee,\r\nhe had found himself so hampered by a “kitchen cabinet” headed by\r\nAndrew Freedman (Mr. Croker’s business partner) and by the continued\r\ninterference of the absent Mr. Croker, that he could no longer lead\r\nTammany Hall and retain his self-respect in the circumstances.\r\n\r\n“Every important act of mine,” Mr. Nixon announced, “has been cabled\r\nto England before it became effective. Mr. Freedman and his party\r\ninterfered with me at every turn, and at last sought to dictate to me\r\nwhom I ought to place on the Board of Sachems.\r\n\r\n“Then a cablegram came from Wantage [Mr. Croker’s estate] direct to\r\nme to place certain men on the Board of Sachems, and when I rebelled\r\nI found that at every turn I would be opposed by this coterie of\r\ninterferers.\r\n\r\n“I found that nearly all my important acts had to be viséd before they\r\nbecame effective. Many of the district leaders would accept my orders,\r\nbut before carrying them out, they would get advice from Mr. Croker.”[5]\r\n\r\nWith this announcement Mr. Nixon vanished from the scene of Tammany\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, certain Tammany district leaders were already\r\nplanning to bring about a change of actual leadership.\r\n\r\nOn May 22, 1902, the Executive Committee of Tammany Hall took steps\r\nwhich tended to sever the relation that Mr. Croker retained with the\r\norganization. It voted to recommend the abolition of the Sub-Committee\r\non Finance which had always been presided over by the various “bosses”\r\nof Tammany Hall, thus eliminating from the chairmanship of that\r\ncommittee Andrew Freedman, who was the representative and mouthpiece of\r\nthe absentee Mr. Croker.\r\n\r\nAt the same time the Executive Committee chose a triumvirate of leaders\r\nto guide the organization. The regency of three thus selected were\r\nCharles F. Murphy, Daniel F. McMahon and Louis F. Haffen. All three, of\r\ncourse, were Tammany district leaders. Mr. Murphy’s career is described\r\nhereafter. Mr. McMahon was chairman of Tammany’s Executive Committee\r\nand head of the contracting firm of Naughton & Company. It was this\r\ncompany that made a fortune from the contract for changing the motive\r\npower of the Third Avenue Railway, regarding which there was so much\r\nscandal. With nothing more than powerful political “pull,” this concern\r\nobtained large contracts. It was charged by John C. Sheehan that\r\nRichard Croker secured 50 per cent. of the profits of this company, and\r\nthat he pocketed $1,500,000 from this source; this assertion, however,\r\ndepended merely upon Mr. Sheehan’s word; it was not established in\r\nany official investigation. The third member of the triumvirate, Mr.\r\nHaffen, was now president of the Borough of the Bronx.\r\n\r\nBut this triumvirate did not last long. On September 19, 1902, it was\r\neffaced, and Charles F. Murphy became the boss of Tammany. This action\r\nwas taken at a meeting of the Executive Committee. At this meeting\r\nformer Chief of Police Devery, holding that he had been elected at the\r\nprimaries, tried to have himself recognized as a district leader, but\r\nhis claims were speedily disposed of and he was shut out. Mr. Haffen\r\nhanded in this resolution:\r\n\r\n    “Whereas, the experiment of the Committee of Three having\r\n    proved the desirability of individual responsibility in\r\n    leadership,\r\n\r\n    “Resolved, That the powers and duties heretofore exercised and\r\n    performed by the Committee of Three be hereafter exercised and\r\n    performed by Charles F. Murphy.”\r\n\r\nNine Tammany district leaders, headed by John F. Carroll, who evidently\r\naimed at power himself, opposed the resolution, but twenty-seven other\r\ndistrict leaders voted it through. One of the leaders immediately sent\r\na cablegram to Mr. Croker announcing the result. Now that Mr. Murphy\r\nwas chosen leader, he also became the treasurer of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Facts for New York Parents_, etc., Published for the Women’s\r\nMunicipal League by the City Club of New York, October, 1901.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[3] From 1895 to 1900 Mr. Amory was connected in an official capacity\r\nwith the Third Avenue Railway Company.\r\n\r\n[4] Report of speech in the New York _Herald_, October 27, 1901.\r\n\r\n[5] This speech was published in the New York _Sun_ and other\r\nnewspapers on the following day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nCHARLES F. MURPHY’S AUTOCRACY\r\n\r\n1902-1903\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles Francis Murphy, supreme leader of the Tammany organization from\r\n1902 to this present writing, was born in New York City on June 20,\r\n1858. He was a son of Dennis Murphy, an Irishman whose eight children\r\nall were born in the same district in New York City, and all of whom\r\nobtained the rudiments at least of a public school education. Dennis\r\nMurphy, it may be here said, lived to the remarkably hale age of\r\neighty-eight years, dying in 1902.\r\n\r\nAs a youth, “Charlie” Murphy worked in an East Side shipyard, by no\r\nmeans a genteel schooling for a boy, although affording a forceful kind\r\nof experience of much value in his later career. Having to fight his\r\nway among rough youths, he developed both physical prowess and a sort\r\nof domineering ascendency which gave him marked leadership qualities\r\namong the virile youths overrunning what was then a district noted for\r\nits gangs. It was a section of the city filled with vacant lots and was\r\nlong called the “Gas House District”; here it was that the notorious\r\n“Gas House Gang” achieved local reputation.\r\n\r\nTradition has it that when a very young man “Charlie” Murphy organized\r\nthe Sylvan Social Club, a species of Tammany Hall juvenile auxiliary,\r\ncomposed of boys and youths ranging from fifteen to twenty years of\r\nage of whom he became the recognized leader. Later, through political\r\ninfluence, he obtained a job as driver on a cross-town horse car\r\nline. In his later career his enemies invidiously related how jobs of\r\nthat kind were much coveted at the time because of the fact that as\r\nthere were no bell punches or car fare registers, the conductors could\r\neasily help themselves to a proportion of the fares and divide with the\r\ndrivers. True, this practise was prevalent, but the implication thus\r\ncast upon Mr. Murphy has been simply a gratuitous one, lacking even the\r\nelements of proof; it can therefore be dismissed from consideration.\r\n\r\nHe was a manly youth noted for his filial care, a solicitous son,\r\nturning in most of his earnings to his mother; he was, in fact,\r\nthe main support of the family. At the same time he put by enough\r\nmoney--said to have been $500--to establish himself in the saloon\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 he became owner of a diminutive saloon on Nineteenth street,\r\neast of Avenue A. Four years later, he opened another saloon, larger\r\nand better equipped than the first, at the corner of Twenty-third\r\nstreet and Avenue A. He was already a pushful, resourceful Tammany\r\nworker in his district, in which he was a district captain. Of the\r\nunderground methods and diversified influences of district politics he\r\nhad a good knowledge, and no less so the application of campaign funds\r\nin the most effective ways for producing votes. Shortly before 1886,\r\nMr. Murphy opened another saloon, this time at Nineteenth street and\r\nFirst avenue. Subsequently he opened still another saloon at Twentieth\r\nstreet and Second avenue, which was the headquarters of the Anawanda\r\nClub, the Tammany district organization. Selling out the original\r\nsaloon in which he had started business, he now opened a saloon at\r\nthe northwest corner of First avenue and Twenty-third street. By\r\n1890 he was the owner of four prosperous saloons. It was said of him\r\nthat he never tolerated a woman in his saloons, although all of his\r\nsaloons were situated in a district where the admission of women was a\r\ncommonplace.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, at the age of thirty-two years, he was chosen Tammany leader\r\nof the “Gas-House” district. He was popular with the generality of\r\npeople there; however reserved was his talk, he was always credited\r\nwith being generous with his cash; no poor person was turned away\r\nempty-handed. It was narrated of him that during the blizzard of 1888\r\nthe Tammany General Committee, at his prompting, voted $4,000 for the\r\nrelief of the poor, and that a large part of it came from Mr. Murphy’s\r\nown pocket. Of the $4,000, the sum of $1,500 was given to the Rev.\r\nDr. Rainsford’s mission for distribution. Such personal acts of human\r\nwarmth (irrespective of motive) counted more with masses of voters than\r\ntons of formal polemics on civic virtue, nor did the recipients care as\r\nto what source the funds came from. Even Dr. Rainsford was so impressed\r\nthat he was moved to say from the pulpit of St. George’s Church that if\r\nall the Tammany leaders were like the leader of the Eighteenth Assembly\r\nDistrict (Mr. Murphy), Tammany would be an admirable organization.\r\n\r\nAs a district leader, Mr. Murphy carried on politics and saloons\r\nsystematically as a combined business. One of his brothers had long\r\nbeen on the police force; another brother was an Alderman; still\r\nanother brother became an Alderman and Councilman.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Van Wyck was elected Mayor, Charles F. Murphy was appointed\r\na Dock Commissioner. Report had it that when he went into the Dock\r\nBoard Mr. Murphy “was worth” perhaps $400,000, accumulated in the\r\nsaloon business and politics in eighteen years. He had long been known\r\nas “Silent Charlie.” Within a few years after his appointment as Dock\r\nCommissioner, his fortune, it was said, reached at least $1,000,000.\r\nWhen he became Dock Commissioner, Mr. Murphy nominally assigned his\r\nfour saloons to a brother and three old friends.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the office of Dock Commissioner, John J. Murphy (Charles\r\nF. Murphy’s brother), James E. Gaffney and Richard J. Crouch (one of\r\nCharles F. Murphy’s political district lieutenants) had incorporated\r\nthe New York Contracting and Trucking Company. Gaffney was an Alderman.\r\nThese three men were credited with holding only five shares each\r\nof the hundred shares of the company; just who held the remaining\r\neighty-five shares has never been definitely explained. When quizzed\r\nlater by a legislative committee, Charles F. Murphy denied that he had\r\nany ownership or financial interest in the New York Contracting and\r\nTrucking Company, and no records could be found proving that he did\r\nhave any interest.\r\n\r\nOne of the transactions of this company was as follows: In July, 1901,\r\nthe company leased a dock at West Ninety-sixth Street, and it leased\r\nanother dock at East Seventy-ninth Street, paying the city a total rent\r\nof $4,800 a year for the two properties. It would appear from a report\r\nsubsequently made by Commissioner of Accounts William Hepburn Russell\r\nto Mayor Low that the average profit from the two dock properties\r\nwas $200 a day, making a rate of 5,000 per cent. on the investment.\r\nThis particular transaction of the New York Contracting and Trucking\r\nCompany, lucrative as it was, nevertheless was modest compared to the\r\ncompany’s subsequent transactions which we shall duly describe.\r\n\r\nCertainly by the year 1902, Mr. Murphy showed the most visible\r\nevidences of some sizable degree of wealth; he acquired a suburban\r\nestate at Good Ground, Long Island, owning, too, in time, among other\r\npossessions denoting wealth, a string of automobiles.\r\n\r\nThis millionaire leader of Tammany Hall was by no means an unpleasant\r\nman to meet. He had a certain diffidence and he was not a good talker;\r\nhis old habit of attentively listening was too strongly fixed.\r\nPhysically strong, his deep voice and direct, concise manner when he\r\ndid speak were impressive and always concentrated on the business at\r\nhand. He had none of the ordinary vices; he drank liquor occasionally,\r\nit was true, but his drinks were sparse and the times far separated.\r\nIn smoking he did not indulge, neither did he swear, nor gamble at\r\ncards, although he was not a stranger to stock market speculations.\r\nA communicant of the Epiphany Roman Catholic Church, he attended\r\nmass every Sunday, and gave liberal donations to the church. Unlike\r\nMr. Croker, Mr. Murphy never cared to make the Democratic Club his\r\nheadquarters; every night, when a district leader, Mr. Murphy could\r\nbe found, from 7:30 to 10 o’clock, leaning against a lamp post at the\r\nnorthwest corner of Twentieth Street and Second Avenue. Everybody in\r\nthe district knew that he would be there, accessible to anybody who\r\nwanted to talk to him. Such were the career and characteristics of the\r\nnew leader of Tammany Hall--a dictator in fact, yet preserving all of\r\nthe tokens of democratic accessibility.\r\n\r\nMayor Low’s administration failed to make an impression calculated to\r\ninfluence a majority of voters to reelect him. Quite true, most of\r\nhis appointees to head the various departments were men of character,\r\nadministrative capacity and sincerity of purpose--radically different\r\ntypes, indeed, from the Tammany district leaders who were usually\r\nappointed to those offices under Tammany administrations.\r\n\r\nBut in appointing Colonel John N. Partridge as commissioner of police,\r\nMayor Low chose a weak and inefficient man. The demoralized condition\r\nof the police administration under Tammany had long been the special\r\ntarget of the reformers’ attacks, and people had expected a wholesome\r\noverhauling of that department under Mayor Low. Colonel Partridge’s\r\nadministration, however, was so disappointing that the City Club was\r\nmoved to demand his resignation. It criticized Commissioner Partridge\r\nfor taking no adequate measures to break up the alliance between the\r\npolice and crime, or to get a proper understanding of the underlying\r\nconditions in the police department, and further criticized him for\r\nsurrounding himself at headquarters with notoriously corrupt officers,\r\none of whom, in fact, was made his principal uniformed adviser.\r\n\r\nThe City Club’s criticism did not charge that Partridge was personally\r\ncorrupt, but that he was weak and gullible and was ignorant of real\r\nconditions. “Commissioner Partridge and his deputies adopted the idea\r\nof ruling the police force according to military ideas. The word\r\nof a superior officer was accepted absolutely as against that of a\r\nsubordinate. In a force where the superior officers had, for the most\r\npart, secured their promotions by bribery; where the superior officers\r\nwere the beneficiaries of blackmailing; and where the honest men, as a\r\nrule, remained subordinates--the attempt to instil a spirit of respect\r\namong the men for their superiors excited only ridicule, and added to\r\nthe prevalent demoralization.…”[1]\r\n\r\nTrue as such a general statement was, it has been equally true, as\r\nexperience has shown, that various other reform police commissioners\r\nhave vainly tried “to break the system”; temporary figures,\r\ncommissioners come and go, but “The System” has remained more or less\r\nintact. Even General Francis V. Greene, appointed by Mayor Low January\r\n1, 1903, to succeed Colonel Partridge (who resigned the day before the\r\ntrustees of the City Club’s demand for his resignation was handed in),\r\nfound this to be a fact, notwithstanding his earnest, conscientious\r\nefforts to correct conditions in the police department.\r\n\r\nThe vote of the body of the police force themselves showed, in 1902,\r\ntheir complete dissatisfaction with conditions. At least 75 per cent.\r\nof the police force voted for Low in 1901; a year later fully 90 per\r\ncent. voted for Bird S. Coler, Tammany’s candidate for Governor.[2]\r\n\r\nThis was only one of many indications of a forthcoming Tammany victory.\r\nEven some reformers criticized Mayor Low as at all times ready to\r\ndenounce the Tammany leader from whom he could expect nothing, while\r\nrefraining from saying anything against Senator Thomas C. Platt, the\r\nRepublican “boss” who represented and headed a political machine\r\nelement not materially different from that of Tammany. Mayor Low,\r\nit was also critically pointed out, was not of a type to hold the\r\ngoodwill of a large body of the proletarian voters; his views, manner\r\nand leanings were of an aristocratic order; and in a city where\r\nclass distinctions were so notoriously and effectively exploited by\r\nTammany Hall, nothing could be more destructive to the endurance of\r\nan administration than the popular belief that its head, however\r\nhonest personally, embodied the interests and smug views of the people\r\nof wealth--that he was, in the expressive phrase of politics, “a\r\nsilk-stocking.” Various acts of Mayor Low’s were cited against him and\r\ndeepened this impression in the popular mind.[3] Mayor Low’s supporters\r\npointed out energetically that he had reduced the city’s debt by\r\n$7,000,000; that he had reformed the system of tax collection; that he\r\nhad secured for the city adequate payments for public franchise grants;\r\nthat he had defeated corrupt “jobs”; that he had reformed the public\r\nschool system--that in every way he had been a thorough reform Mayor.\r\nThese representations, the election result showed, were in vain.\r\n\r\nWith conditions favorable to its return to power, Tammany Hall took\r\nmeasures to make its ticket in the municipal campaign of 1903 headed by\r\na candidate whose name stood for prestige and respectability.\r\n\r\nTammany’s candidate for Mayor was George B. McClellan, whose father\r\nof the same name, after serving as Commanding General in the Union\r\nArmy during part of the Civil War, had been the Democratic candidate\r\nfor President of the United States in 1864. A political protégé of\r\nCharles F. Murphy, George B. McClellan had seen service in Congress\r\nand had been selected by Mr. Murphy as Tammany’s candidate for Mayor\r\na considerable time before the campaign opened. Jealousy antagonistic\r\nto Tammany’s domination and assertion of supreme power, the Brooklyn\r\nDemocratic organization, then under control of “Boss” Hugh McLaughlin,\r\nopposed McClellan’s nomination, but Mr. Murphy carried his point.\r\n\r\nTo the amazement and chagrin of the Republicans and Fusionists,\r\nTammany Hall then consummated a bold and astute political stroke by\r\nappropriating two of the three principal nominees of its opponents’\r\nticket, and nominating them as Tammany candidates. These two men were\r\nEdward M. Grout and Charles V. Fornes, respectively occupying the\r\noffices of Controller and President of the Board of Aldermen under\r\nMayor Low’s administration. With Mayor Low they had been renominated.\r\nThus did Tammany shrewdly weaken the other side and present itself\r\nas having two chief candidates of the same identity and capacity as\r\nthose of the reformers. Mayor Low and his supporters did not accept\r\nthis unhumorous situation complacently; they indignantly forced Grout\r\nand Fornes off their ticket. But the effect sought by Tammany had been\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nMr. McClellan was elected Mayor by a plurality of 62,696. The vote\r\nresulted: McClellan, 314,782; Low, 252,086. Furman, candidate for\r\nMayor of the Social Democratic party, received 16,596 votes; Hunter,\r\nthe Socialist Labor party’s candidate for Mayor, 5,205 votes. For the\r\nProhibition ticket 869 votes were cast. In this election Tammany also\r\nelected its candidates, including Grout and Fornes, to all of the\r\nother important city offices, except the Presidency of the Borough of\r\nRichmond. The results of the election practically gave Tammany Hall\r\nfull control of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _The Police Department of the City of New York--A Statement of\r\nFacts_, published by the City Club of New York, October, 1903, pp.\r\n52-55, etc.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, p. 58.\r\n\r\n[3] See a long letter from a leading reformer published in the New York\r\n_Herald_, April 12, 1903.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE SWAY OF BRIBERY AND “HONEST GRAFT”\r\n\r\n1903-1905\r\n\r\n\r\nGraft of all kinds was rampant, as later official investigation showed,\r\nin Tammany-controlled departments, but in the public mind the question\r\nof this form of graft was vastly overshadowed by the revelations of the\r\nNew York legislative committee investigating the great life insurance\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nThe disclosures showed that Republican legislators as well as\r\nDemocratic were bought; that enormous corruption funds had been\r\ncontributed to both political parties, and that one political machine\r\nwas no better than the other.\r\n\r\nBribery expenditures, the committee reported, were classified on the\r\nvarious insurance companies’ books as “legal expenses.” The committee\r\ndescribed the amounts as extraordinarily large. In the year 1904 alone,\r\nthe Mutual Life Insurance Company thus disbursed $364,254.95; the\r\nEquitable Life Assurance Society, $172,698.42, and the New York Life\r\nInsurance Company, $204,019.25.[1]\r\n\r\nAndrew C. Fields, long engaged by the Mutual Life Insurance Company\r\nto manipulate legislation at Albany, lived there in a sumptuously\r\nfurnished house jocosely styled the “House of Mirth.” The expenditures\r\nwere charged to “legal expenses.” The Mutual thus expended more than\r\n$2,000,000 in “legal expenses” from 1898 to 1904.[2] And from 1895\r\nto 1904, the total payments made by the New York Life Insurance\r\nCompany to Andrew Hamilton, its chief lobbyist at Albany, amounted\r\nto $1,312,197.16, all of which sum was soberly entered as “legal\r\nexpenses.”[3] A present of nearly $50,000 was contributed in 1894\r\nby the New York Life Insurance Company to the campaign fund of the\r\nRepublican National Committee, and similar amounts in 1896 and 1900 to\r\nthe same recipient.[4] All of the large insurance companies regularly\r\ncontributed funds not only for national political campaigns, but for\r\nthose in the States; the Equitable, for example, gave $50,000 in\r\n1904 to the Republican National Committee, and had also, for many\r\nyears, been giving $30,000 annually to the New York State Republican\r\nCommittee.[5] The legislative investigating committee found it\r\nimpossible to trace all of the directions of this continuous great\r\ncorruption. “Enormous sums,” the committee stated, “have been expended\r\nin a surreptitious manner.”\r\n\r\nUnder the pressure of public opinion, District Attorney Jerome finally\r\ncaused the Grand Jury to proceed against a few of the figureheads\r\ninvolved; the great magnates who had profited so enormously from the\r\nhuge frauds, were, so events proved, left untouched. Although it had\r\nbeen clearly proved by the testimony that the frauds and corruptions\r\nconsummated were gigantic, not a single one of those of great wealth\r\nimplicated was ever sent to jail or even incommoded by the formality of\r\na trial.\r\n\r\nIn the face of such disclosures, the opponents of Tammany could not\r\nwell point to Tammany corruption as an exclusive product. It was a\r\ntime, too, when what was termed “muckraking” was almost at its height;\r\nmagazines and newspapers, were filled with articles exposing in detail\r\nthe corruptions and colossal manipulations and spoliation done by great\r\ncorporations and other vested interests, and the close connection\r\nbetween these and the “bosses” and machines of both old political\r\nparties. Public attention was concentrated more upon these nationwide\r\nscandals than upon local graft--petty, indeed, in some respects,\r\ncompared to the great extortions of trusts and other industrial,\r\ntransportation and financial corporations.\r\n\r\nThese factors had their influence in developing in New York City\r\na powerful movement called the Municipal Ownership League, later\r\npassing under the name of the Independence League. The head of this\r\norganization was William R. Hearst. He had inherited a large fortune\r\nfrom his father, United States Senator George Hearst. The estate\r\ncomprised a San Francisco newspaper; and William R. Hearst had come to\r\nNew York, where he now had a morning and an evening newspaper. Of a\r\nsensational order, yet written in popular style, these newspapers had\r\nan extensive circulation, and their agitational matter were in reality\r\nthe mainstay of his movement. Two of the local objectives of this\r\nagitation were the scandalous overcrowding of the street car system\r\nand the methods by which the subway system in New York City, built\r\nby the city’s credit, had been turned over to the profit of private\r\ninterests. At the same time, no means was neglected to awaken popular\r\nresentment against the “plunderbund” fattening on the people, and to\r\narouse indignation against the bossism of Tammany Hall. Day after day\r\neffective articles, editorials and cartoons were published; written\r\nin a simple style, understandable by the crudest intelligence, they\r\nproduced a great effect among the voters. Nothing quite like this\r\noriginal kind of political journalism had ever been known in New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the New York Contracting and Trucking Company, in\r\nparticular, supplied facts which were used effectually by newspapers\r\nand civic organizations to show the new methods by which Tammany\r\nleaders were gathering in millions from contracts. This company, as we\r\nhave seen, was headed by John J. Murphy, brother of the Tammany Hall\r\nchief, and by Alderman James E. Gaffney.\r\n\r\nIts transactions revealed the great difference between Tweed’s methods\r\nand those of the later leaders of Tammany Hall. Under the Tweed régime\r\ntens of millions of dollars were stolen outright. The lesson of the\r\noverthrow of the Tweed “ring” was not lost on his successors. Mr.\r\nCroker refused to countenance such outworn, discarded and dangerous\r\nmethods of theft. They had resulted disastrously to Tammany in Tweed’s\r\nday. In place of direct thieving methods of getting rich, indirect\r\nmethods, surrounded with secrecy and every possible precaution against\r\ndetection, were developed. Some Tammany district leaders became opulent\r\non blackmail and extortion, the circuitous route of which it was most\r\ndifficult to trace (in a legal sense) to its final destination. As for\r\nMr. Croker himself, the question was frequently put to him, “Where did\r\nyou get it?”[6] He could reply that his operations in amassing his\r\nwealth were entirely legitimate; “inside” real estate speculations,\r\nconnections with trust companies and other corporations and stock\r\ntransactions. Knowing him to be the source of much legislation and\r\nadministrative favors worth tens, if not hundreds, of millions of\r\ndollars to corporations, his opponents were by no means wholly\r\nsatisfied with such an explanation, but whatever their suspicions\r\nthey could never prove that he had personally profited from selling\r\nlegislation. Essentially, however, Mr. Croker never posed as a business\r\nman; he was a politician.\r\n\r\nBut by the period when Charles F. Murphy became “chief,” the\r\n“business-man” type of leader had evolved. Under this plan--a plan that\r\nafforded the most plausible opportunities for explaining the sudden\r\nacquisition of wealth--Tammany men became open or secret partners\r\nin contracting firms, using the pressure of political power to have\r\nlarge contracts awarded to their concerns. It was not necessary\r\nfor these leaders to know anything of contracting; they could be\r\nignorant of every detail; their one aim was to get the contracts; the\r\nactual skilled work could be done by hired professional men. No law\r\npenalized such methods, respectable in every appearance. At the same\r\ntime, inasmuch as speculating in the stock market was legitimate in\r\nlaw, fortunes could be made in acting upon advance information of\r\nlegislative or other official means concerning certain corporations.\r\n\r\nThe first large contract obtained by the New York Contracting and\r\nTrucking Company was a $2,000,000 contract for excavating the site for\r\nthe new Pennsylvania Railroad Station in New York City.\r\n\r\nFor a long time, notwithstanding reiterated protests from the press and\r\npublic organizations, the Board of Aldermen, controlled by Tammany, had\r\nobstinately refused to vote for the franchise giving the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad power to use streets for its tunnel approaches and terminal\r\nin Manhattan, New York City. Reports were circulated that the sum of\r\n$300,000 had been demanded by the Aldermen, and that until that sum was\r\nproduced they would not vote for the franchise. It was noted that it\r\nwas “Big Jim” Gaffney, “outside man” for the New York Contracting and\r\nTrucking Company and Alderman from Leader Charles F. Murphy’s district,\r\nwho, together with “Little Tim” Sullivan, Tammany leader in the Board\r\nof Aldermen, took a leading part in persuading the Aldermen to hold\r\nout against giving the franchise for the Pennsylvania tunnel. The\r\nnewspapers unanimously described the Aldermanic action as a “hold-up.”\r\nLikewise, it was also noted that when from some mysterious quarter\r\norders reached Tammany Aldermen to vote for the franchise, it was\r\nAlderman Gaffney who took the lead in rallying the Aldermen to vote it\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nThis sudden change of front after a protracted “hold-up,” puzzled\r\nthe public exceedingly, and sinister imputations were made. Not until\r\nmonths later did the public begin to see illumination; it was then\r\nannounced that although the New York Contracting and Trucking Company\r\nhad not been the lowest bidder (its bid, according to report, was\r\n$400,000 more than that of a competitor), nevertheless it had been\r\nawarded the $2,000,000 contract for digging the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nsite.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the awarding of a contract covering several million\r\ndollars in February, 1905, to the New York Contracting and Trucking\r\nCompany for the six-track local improvement of the New York, New Haven\r\nand Hartford Railroad, the circumstances were much the same.\r\n\r\nA franchise had been asked for a project called the New York,\r\nWestchester and Boston Railroad Company. At the same time, another\r\ncompany calling itself the New York and Port Chester Railroad Company,\r\nmade a similar application and opposed the other company. Both\r\ncompanies, as subsequent developments showed, were in fact owned by the\r\nNew York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad; the opposition of one to the\r\nother was evidently for mere effect.\r\n\r\nFor three years the Board of Aldermen refused to give the franchises,\r\neither one of which would give the New York, New Haven and Hartford\r\nRailroad its own independent entrance into New York City. Somehow and\r\nfrom somewhere the announcement was now made that unless the Board of\r\nAldermen acted, a law would be passed by the Legislature stripping it\r\nof all power of granting franchises. This threat was executed; the\r\nLegislature passed an act vesting franchise-granting power in the Board\r\nof Estimate and Apportionment. It may here be parenthetically noted\r\nthat with the great powers increasingly vested in it the Board of\r\nEstimate became the most compact and powerful instrument of government\r\nthat had ever been developed in the government of New York City.\r\n\r\nThis body is composed of eight officials. Of these, three\r\nofficials,--the Mayor, the Controller and the President of the Board of\r\nAldermen,--have, by reason of a greater vested plurality of votes, the\r\ndominance of power. The other five members are the Borough Presidents.\r\n\r\nThe first point passed upon by this Board was the question of whether\r\nor not the New York, Westchester and Boston Railroad Company was or\r\nwas not a defunct corporation. On March 30, 1904, Corporation Council\r\nDelany (elected by Tammany Hall) reported to the Board of Estimate and\r\nApportionment that the Board had no jurisdiction to examine the legal\r\ncapacity or incapacity of the company.[7]\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1904, the company received its franchise. The company was\r\nreally an adjunct of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad,\r\nand its franchise gave it the right to operate more than sixteen\r\nmiles of four-track line within New York City; the company secured\r\npractically all the available routes for entrance and exit to and from\r\nNew York City by way of the Bronx. It was the $6,000,000 contract for\r\nconstructing this railroad improvement that the New York Contracting\r\nand Trucking Company secured.\r\n\r\nThe declaration was made that no other contractor had ventured to\r\ncompete for this work; and the explanation was offered in some quarters\r\nthat inasmuch as a large part of the work was located inside the city\r\nlimits and as an unfriendly city administration might do much to\r\nhamper the carrying out of the contract, the New York, New Haven and\r\nHartford officials, with a cautious eye to the railroad’s interests,\r\nwere willing to award the contract to the Tammany firm and pay higher\r\nprices. Mr. Gaffney asserted that politics had nothing to do with the\r\nobtaining of the contract and that his company “had bid with other\r\ncontractors and won out,” but politicians did not take this statement\r\nseriously. In February, 1907, the New York Contracting and Trucking\r\nCompany surrendered its contract for a consideration of $500,000\r\nto another company, the Holbrook, Cabot & Daly Company, which had\r\npreviously done much of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad’s\r\nconstruction work. It was not until seven years later that the fact,\r\noriginally suspected, as to why the contract had been given without\r\ncompetition to the Gaffney-Murphy company, was authoritatively stated.\r\nOn May 20, 1914, Charles S. Mellen, long president of the New York, New\r\nHaven and Hartford Railroad, testified before the Interstate Commerce\r\nCommission that the contract had been turned over to that Tammany\r\nconcern “to avoid friction with the city,” meaning that by giving\r\nthe contract to the Tammany company, city officials would attempt\r\nno “hold-up,” such as placing obstacles in the way of carrying the\r\nconstruction work through.\r\n\r\nFurther disclosures strongly indicated that during the time when the\r\nWestchester franchise was acquired by the New York, New Haven and\r\nHartford Railroad, certain powers in Tammany Hall “had to be taken care\r\nof,” and that they benefited financially.\r\n\r\nAfter being looted of large sums in financial jugglery, the New York,\r\nNew Haven and Hartford Railroad had been thrown on the verge of\r\ninsolvency. It was revealed in 1918 that a certain $12,000,000 of New\r\nYork, New Haven and Hartford Railroad money put into the Westchester\r\nproject had mysteriously vanished in unexplained directions. The\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, in 1914, conducted an investigation\r\nto find out specifically, if possible, what became of those missing\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nOn April 24, 1914, Oakley Thorne, a New York banker, who had been the\r\nagent of J. P. Morgan & Company in handling the $12,000,000 for the\r\npurpose of secretly purchasing the Westchester and the Portchester\r\nfranchises for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, gave\r\ncertain testimony before the Interstate Commerce Commission. He averred\r\nthat he had burned the books containing the particulars as to how he\r\nhad spent at least $8,000,000; he explained that he therefore could\r\nnot give names, amounts and dates. A letter written by Mr. Thorne in\r\nOctober, 1906, to C. S. Mellen, president of the New York, New Haven\r\nand Hartford Railroad, was produced. In this letter Thorne wrote that\r\n“there are people in Fourteenth Street who are very strongly in favor\r\nof Westchester and others in favor of Portchester,” and suggested that\r\n“both sides will have to be taken care of.” Asked what the reference\r\nto “Fourteenth Street” meant, Thorne replied, “Why, I believe, Tammany\r\nHall.” Mr. Thorne testified that he could not possibly remember the\r\nnames of any individuals in “Fourteenth Street” who “had to be taken\r\ncare of,” but he admitted that he knew that “Big Tim” Sullivan was\r\n“friendly” to the Westchester “enterprise” and owned stock in it; at\r\nthe time this testimony was given Sullivan was dead.\r\n\r\nMr. Thorne asserted that he could not recall definite particulars,\r\nbut he could vaguely remember that there were persons in “Fourteenth\r\nStreet” who had, at the time, been “interested in the Westchester\r\nCity and Contract Company, the New York Development Company and other\r\nconcerns that subsequently formed a part of the Westchester combination\r\nturned over to the New Haven [the New York, New Haven and Hartford\r\nRailroad Company] through Morgan & Company.” Certain “persons in\r\nFourteenth Street,” Mr. Thorne further testified, had to be bought off\r\nbecause of their “nuisance value,” but precisely what was the nature of\r\nthat “nuisance value” was not explained. In the disposition of the many\r\nmillions of dollars placed in his hands, Mr. Thorne was not required to\r\nmake any accounting or give any vouchers.\r\n\r\nFurther details of later developments were given in the testimony of\r\nCharles S. Mellen, president of the New York, New Haven and Hartford\r\nRailroad during the years when the above franchises were acquired.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 1914, Mr. Mellen testified, at a hearing before the\r\nInterstate Commerce Commission, that the directors of that railroad\r\nset aside a fund of $1,200,000, the value of 8,000 shares of New York,\r\nNew Haven and Hartford Railroad stock, which sum was distributed\r\namong “people of influence” in the politics of New York City for\r\nthe procuring of certain much-desired changes in the charter of\r\nthe New York, Westchester and Boston Railroad Company. Mr. Mellen\r\nfurther testified that Inspector Thomas F. Byrnes, who, for many\r\nyears, had been head of the New York Police Department (and who was\r\ndeceased at the time of this hearing) had acted as the go-between in\r\nthis transaction; that Byrnes agreed to obtain thirteen different\r\nmodifications or “amendments” to the New York, Westchester and Boston\r\nRailroad charter from New York city’s officials; and that to bring\r\nabout these results stock, or its equivalent in cash, to the sum\r\nof $1,200,000, was given to Byrnes for distribution among Tammany\r\npoliticians whose identity Mr. Mellen declared that he did not know.\r\nMr. Mellen’s testimony revealed that some of these persons accepted\r\nstock made out in the names of dummies, but that the majority demanded\r\nand received cash for their “services.” All but $50,000 of the\r\n$1,200,000 was distributed.\r\n\r\nThe records of the Board of Estimate in 1908 and 1909 bear out Mr.\r\nMellen’s testimony; they show that nearly every request for alterations\r\nof the charter or extensions of time made by the New York, New Haven\r\nand Hartford Railroad was granted. The Board of Estimate during the\r\nyears in question consisted of Mayor McClellan; Controller Herman A.\r\nMetz; Patrick F. McGowan, President of the Board of Aldermen; John F.\r\nAhearn, President of the Borough of Manhattan; Bird S. Coler, President\r\nof the Borough of Brooklyn; Louis F. Haffen, President of the Borough\r\nof the Bronx; Lawrence Gresser, President of the Borough of Queens,\r\nand George Cromwell, President of the Borough of Richmond.[8]\r\n\r\nContinuing his testimony, Mr. Mellen stated, on May 20, 1914, that\r\nupon further recollection he found that the amount distributed to\r\npoliticians in connection with securing the Westchester franchise and\r\nalterations to the charter, really totaled $1,500,000 or $1,600,000.\r\nMuch of this amount was presented in the form of due bills sent in\r\nby Tammany politicians by means of messengers; Mr. Mellen personally\r\nhanded over cash for the due bills, but the names of the recipients he\r\nsaid he could not remember. “Do you know,” Mr. Mellen was asked, “what\r\nall this Westchester and Portchester stock was doing in Tammany Hall?”\r\n“I know,” he replied, “what it was doing to me when I took it on. It\r\nwas costing me lots of money.” “Do you know how all this stock reached\r\nTammany Hall?” “I have not the slightest idea. I could suppose a lot of\r\nthings, but I do not know anything about it.”\r\n\r\nSubmitting, on July 11, 1914, the results of its investigation\r\nto the United States Senate, the Interstate Commerce Commission\r\nreported that the facts as to the New York, Westchester and Boston\r\nRailway transaction constituted “a story of the profligate waste of\r\ncorporate funds.” The fullest details are set forth in that report of\r\nthe magnitude of the corruption used. Commenting upon Mr. Mellen’s\r\ntestimony, the report declared: “The testimony is somewhat occult,\r\nbut the character of the transaction is no less certain. This money\r\nwas used for corrupt purposes, and the improper expenditures covered\r\nup by the transfer to the New Haven [New York, New Haven and Hartford\r\nRailroad Company] of these worthless securities.… It seems very strange\r\nthat Mr. Mellen was not able to identify with any particularity any one\r\nwith whom he had these transactions except the late Thomas F. Byrnes.\r\nNo comment is necessary to make clear to the mind the corrupt and\r\nunlawful nature of this transaction, and it would seem that the amount\r\nillegally expended could be recovered from Mr. Mellen and the directors\r\nwho authorized it.…”[9]\r\n\r\nThere is now pending (1917) a suit in the United States District Court\r\nbrought by the stockholders against the former directors of the New\r\nYork, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Company and against the company\r\nfor the return of $165,000,000 alleged to have been lost to the\r\ntreasury of that railroad in various ways.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the operations of the New York Contracting\r\nand Trucking Company: Another contract secured by that concern was a\r\ncontract from the Consolidated Gas Company for grading the site for the\r\nAstoria gas plant; the franchise for the Astoria “Gas Grab” had been\r\nsupported by Tammany.\r\n\r\nBy 1905 it was estimated that the New York Contracting and Trucking\r\nCompany or its offshoots had received contracts aggregating\r\n$15,000,000--all contracts from corporations and interests benefiting\r\nfrom the city government or depending upon favors from it. Yet\r\ntwo years previously this very company was a nonentity as far as\r\nsecuring large contracts were concerned, and none of its heads\r\nhad any experience in the contracting business. Now in a certain\r\nwell-understood field, it was virtually free from competition.\r\n\r\nNone could now fail to note the great transition from the Tweed\r\nperiod when Tammany leaders used only the vulgar and criminal methods\r\nof stealing money out of the city treasury. Under Murphy’s leadership\r\nthe obvious methods used were those of “honest graft”--the making of\r\nmillions from contracts with public service corporations, and this was\r\nrepresented as legitimate business. Fully six Tammany district leaders\r\nwere members of or “interested” in large contracting firms, although\r\nthe heads of these, often of a nominal character, were not known as\r\nTammany leaders. These concerns employed a total of many thousands\r\nof men, all of whom were expected to be useful at the primaries and\r\nelections.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was discernible the beginnings of a growing feeling\r\nthat reform officials, while prosecuting gamblers and comparatively\r\npetty offenders of all stripes, somehow were singularly ineffective in\r\nbringing about the prosecution of corporation magnates charged with\r\nlooting on a large scale. This feeling had not crystallized as yet, but\r\nit was felt in some quarters.\r\n\r\nSome of District Attorney Jerome’s former supporters were impressed\r\nby the fact that despite his campaign promises, he had not caused\r\nthe indictment or other prosecution of the men who had looted the\r\nMetropolitan Street Railway Company. James W. Osborne, a noted\r\nattorney, had declared in open court in 1903, that the “insiders” had,\r\nby means of duplicating of construction accounts, manipulation and\r\nin other ways, stolen $30,000,000. Mr. Amory declared and specified\r\nthat an additional $60,000,000 had, by various processes of devious\r\nmanipulation, gone to enrich the “insiders”--a total of $90,000,000.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 1903, Mr. Osborne gave out this statement: “We have\r\nproduced evidence before Magistrate Barlow which shows a crime has been\r\ncommitted, and now it is up to the District Attorney to say whether he\r\nwill avail himself of that evidence and proceed against those who have\r\ncommitted the crime. We have charged in open court that $30,000,000\r\nhas been stolen, and that [statement] never has been disproved by the\r\nMetropolitan Company or its counsel. I told Mr. Nicoll, counsel for Mr.\r\nVreeland [president of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company] openly\r\nhe would not be able to disprove my charges.”\r\n\r\nMr. Amory openly declared that Mr. Jerome’s investigation of the\r\nmatter in 1903 was not undertaken in good faith. “It was,” he wrote,\r\n“a deliberate whitewash. I have documentary evidence to prove it.” Mr.\r\nAmory charged that of the twenty-seven distinct written charges filed\r\nwith Mr. Jerome against the Metropolitan management, Mr. Jerome’s\r\naccountant reported on only seven, and these latter were of minor\r\nimportance, involving chiefly technicalities of accounts and not\r\nserious crimes. Yet Mr. Jerome, was Mr. Amory’s indignant comment,\r\nrepresented that the accountant’s report was “very clear and full and\r\ntakes up every charge” and that Mr. Jerome had reported that “the\r\nspecific charges so far as they involve criminal wrong-doing are\r\nentirely without foundation.”[10]\r\n\r\nWhile thus declaring that he could find nothing on which to base\r\nprosecution of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company magnates,\r\nDistrict Attorney Jerome showed by other acts, it was complained,\r\nthat petty criminals would be prosecuted to the limit of the law. He\r\nwas charged with discriminating between rich and powerful business\r\noffenders, on the one side, and on the other, poor and relatively\r\nuninfluential violators of the law.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion Mr. Jerome appeared before labor unions, delivered\r\nhomilies on the virtues, and warned them that he would make short\r\nshrift of labor grafters. This lecture had reference to the case of Sam\r\nParks, a labor leader, charged with grafting on employers and receiving\r\nmoney for prompting or “calling off” strikes. District Attorney\r\nJerome waited for no elaborate formal investigation; he immediately\r\nstarted the machinery of his office against Parks and caused him to be\r\nconvicted. Already a dying consumptive, Parks was sentenced to prison,\r\nwhere he died shortly after. But no action, it was pointed out, was\r\ntaken against powerful construction companies that had bribed Parks\r\nand other labor leaders to declare strikes on buildings for which\r\ncompetitors had the contracts.[11] Another much-discussed incident\r\nwas the result of a collision of railroad trains in the Park Avenue\r\ntunnel--a collision maiming and killing many persons. The obsolete\r\nand dangerous condition of this tunnel had long been known. It was\r\ncommented that District Attorney Jerome did not make the slightest move\r\nagainst the railroad directors; he hurriedly caused the indictment\r\nand arrest of Wisker, a railroad engineer, as the sole culprit and\r\nproceeded with despatch to his trial. The jury, however, refused to\r\nconvict the engineer.\r\n\r\nConsidering that Mr. Jerome was a leading reformer, such contrasts\r\nwere gradually calculated to make the very mention of reform odious\r\nto the observing of the working people. The complaint was generally\r\nheard that the big grafters were safe and immune, while petty offenders\r\nwere dealt with rigorously. Nevertheless, a large number of voters,\r\ninfluenced by a stream of praise from the press, still believed in Mr.\r\nJerome’s promises and motives, and his action in 1905 in not securing\r\na renomination from political bosses but procuring it independently by\r\nmeans of a petition circulated among electors, strengthened the old\r\nbelief that he was sincere and was independent of political and other\r\ndomination. Much was made of the fact of his independent renomination.\r\nThe Republicans withdrew their candidate for District Attorney and\r\nnominated Mr. Jerome, and the press in general enthusiastically\r\nsupported him. He was reelected. It was not until some years later when\r\nthe full effects of his administration could be popularly realized in\r\nperspective, that Jerome fell into general disfavor with the voters.\r\n\r\nAs an instance of the methods of contractors under the Tammany régime\r\nduring this time, it is only necessary to mention the facts, later\r\ndisclosed in an investigation by John Purroy Mitchel, Commissioner\r\nof Accounts, as to how in 1904 defective hose was sold to the Fire\r\nDepartment. The Windsor Fire Appliance Company (of which the president\r\nand chief stockholder was Michael F. Loughman, later appointed Deputy\r\nCommissioner of Water Supply) sold 25,000 feet of hose to New York City\r\nfor $23,410.25. Although this hose did not answer the specifications\r\nof the contract, it was accepted. The consequence was that it burst\r\nmany times at fires, some of them serious. The same was true of equally\r\nworthless hose supplied by other contractors.\r\n\r\nThe municipal election in 1905 was a triangular contest. Tammany Hall\r\ndid not fear the Republican ticket headed by William M. Ivins for\r\nMayor. But it did have intense uneasiness over the possibility of Mr.\r\nHearst triumphing; his movement was too plainly making inroads among\r\nlarge numbers of voters that ordinarily would have voted the Tammany\r\nticket. Tammany was particularly bent upon winning inasmuch as by the\r\nprovisions of the revised charter the term of the incoming Mayor and\r\nother officials had been changed to a four-year incumbency. Hearst\r\nwas the Municipal Ownership League’s candidate for Mayor, and Tammany\r\nrenominated Mayor McClellan. So effective were Hearst’s onslaughts\r\non “Boss” Murphy and the elements represented by him that during the\r\ncampaign Mayor McClellan repeatedly made promises that he would\r\nthereafter pursue an independent course, should he be reelected.\r\n\r\nMr. Hearst’s vote returns came in so heavily after the polls were\r\nclosed that it looked as though he were certainly elected. That very\r\nnight there was a strange interruption, lasting about an hour, in the\r\npublic giving-out of the returns. Then as the returns were resumed,\r\nit appeared that although the vote between McClellan and Hearst was\r\nextremely close, McClellan had a little the better of it. The next\r\nday it was announced that Mayor McClellan was reelected by a close\r\nmargin. Mr. Hearst and his followers declared that manifest fraud had\r\nbeen committed, and took steps to have a recount. Meantime while this\r\nprocess was dragging along, Mayor McClellan was widely criticized for\r\nhis action in immediately claiming his reelection, opposing a recount,\r\nand not showing faith in the legitimacy of his claims by waiting with\r\ndignity until there had been a careful official recount.\r\n\r\nThe final official recount gave this result: McClellan, 228,407 votes\r\nHearst, 224,929 votes; Ivins, 137,184 votes. It may be added here that\r\nin the very next year--in 1906--Hearst accepted a Tammany indorsement\r\nwhen he ran for Governor, but he was defeated by Charles E. Hughes,\r\nwho, as counsel for the Legislative Insurance Committee, had achieved\r\nwide popularity for his exposure of the insurance company iniquities.\r\n\r\nWith the reelection of Mr. McClellan, Tammany Hall confidently looked\r\nforward to four more years of unquestioned control of the immense\r\nbudget and enormous opportunities embodied in the rule of New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Report of the New York Legislative Insurance Committee_, 1906,\r\nVol. X, p. 16.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[3] _Ibid._, p. 50.\r\n\r\n[4] _Ibid._, pp. 62 and 398.\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid._, p. 10.\r\n\r\n[6] Mr. Croker, in 1900, had admitted his liability to an English tax\r\non a yearly income of $100,000.\r\n\r\n[7] The company had filed articles of incorporation in 1872, but\r\nwas charged with being an abortive corporation in that it had never\r\ncompleted the necessary formalities required by law.\r\n\r\n[8] As we shall see later, the political composition of the Board of\r\nEstimate was at this time considerably mixed; during his second term\r\nMayor McClellan was fighting Mr. Murphy, leader of Tammany Hall, and\r\nhad the backing of Senator McCarren and of McCarren’s lieutenant,\r\nController Metz. Mr. McGowan, president of the Board of Aldermen,\r\nwas supposed to be a Tammany man, but was not on good terms with the\r\n“Organization” and was credited with being aligned with McClellan and\r\nMetz.\r\n\r\n[9] _Interstate Commerce Commission Report No. 6569_, In re _Financial\r\nTransactions of the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad Co._,\r\nJuly 11, 1914, pp. 35, 38, etc. The above are but a few extracts from\r\nthis comprehensive report.\r\n\r\n[10] _The Truth About Metropolitan_, by W.

In this estimate they were\r\nmistaken. Mayor McClellan broke relations with Charles F. Murphy in\r\nJanuary, 1906, and announced that he would keep every promise made by\r\nhim “on the stump.” His appointment of anti-Murphy men to office had a\r\nnettling effect on the leader of Tammany Hall, against whom he began a\r\nsystematic campaign. Results, still more serious to Tammany leaders,\r\nwere forthcoming.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Borough of Manhattan was John A. Ahearn, a noted\r\nTammany district leader. He had been a State Senator from 1889 to 1902,\r\nand had been elected president of the Borough of Manhattan in 1903,\r\nand reelected in 1905 for a term of four years. It may be explained\r\nthat the presidency of a borough was a powerful office, having direct\r\nappointive and supervisory power over six departments with expenditures\r\nof many millions of dollars annually.[1]\r\n\r\nCharges of misconduct were brought against Mr. Ahearn, in 1906, by\r\nthe Bureau of City Betterment (later called the Bureau of Municipal\r\nResearch). When Mr. Ahearn requested an investigation by the\r\nCommissioners of Accounts, Mayor McClellan accommodated his desire.\r\nThe report of these commissioners, handed in to the Mayor, July 16,\r\n1907, severely arraigned Ahearn’s administration, and after specifying\r\nparticulars, the report denounced “the inefficiency, neglect, waste and\r\ncorruption disclosed in the course of this inquiry.”[2]\r\n\r\nThe investigation showed that in the three years that Mr. Ahearn\r\nhad occupied the office of borough president, he had control of an\r\nexpenditure totaling $21,994,477. Of this amount it was shown that\r\n$1,608,762 was spent in the purchase of supplies without public\r\ntender being asked, as required by law. It was proved that many of\r\nthe payrolls (amounting to an aggregate of $5,942,187) were padded\r\nwith the names of men who never did a day’s work for the department.\r\nEven in the expenditures made under contract--expenditures totaling\r\n$14,447,473 in the three years--it was proved that little effort was\r\nmade to compel contractors to observe their obligations. Fully a third\r\nof the total expenditure--the third amounting to $5,400,000--was\r\nlost to the city, it was asserted, by the manner in which the\r\ndepartment was administered. There were still further losses to the\r\ncity; and although, also, there was plenty of money at Mr. Ahearn’s\r\ndisposal for the repairs of street pavements, that work, it was\r\nheld, was considerably neglected. The evidence in the commissioners’\r\ninvestigation and the evidence presented by the City Club in subsequent\r\nhearings ordered by Governor Hughes showed that supply contractors\r\noften made profits ranging from 100 to 200 per cent. (and in at least\r\none case 300 to 500 per cent.) more than the regular prices prevailing\r\nin the open market.\r\n\r\nAmong other disclosures the testimony revealed that $144,500 had been\r\npaid out for asphalt “fire burns,” which in reality were not “fire\r\nburns” at all; they were defects that the asphalt companies were\r\nobliged to repair without charge. The favorite contractors were such\r\nTammany district leaders as Bartholomew Dunn, Thomas J. Dunn and others.\r\n\r\nOn December 9, 1907, Governor Hughes removed Mr. Ahearn from office.\r\nIn his notice of ejection, Governor Hughes said that justice to Mr.\r\nAhearn required that attention should be called to the fact that “it is\r\nnot shown, and it has not been claimed, that he has converted public\r\nmoney or property to his own use, or has personally profited in an\r\nunlawful manner by his official conduct.” But Governor Hughes said\r\nthat he did find that the charges of maladministration, remissness and\r\ngrave abuses existing under Ahearn’s administration had been proved.\r\nMr. Ahearn was, in reality, a victim of the Tammany system. A few days\r\nlater, the Manhattan Aldermen reelected him--a move that was contested\r\nby taking the case to the Court of Appeals, which in November, 1909,\r\nsustained his removal and disapproved of his reelection. Meanwhile, he\r\nhad continued in office.\r\n\r\nAnother conspicuous Tammany leader removed from office was Louis F.\r\nHaffen, president of the Borough of the Bronx. He had held that office\r\nsince January 1, 1898, and had been last reelected in 1905. Mr. Haffen\r\nwas, as we have seen, one of the regency of three controlling Tammany\r\nHall immediately previous to Charles F. Murphy’s assumption of sole\r\nleadership. He was a Sachem of the Tammany Society.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1908, twenty-two charges were presented to Governor Hughes\r\nby John Purroy Mitchel and Ernest Gallagher, Commissioners of Accounts\r\nof New York City, at the instance of Mayor McClellan.[3] The City Club\r\nand the Citizens’ Union jointly filed charges against Mr. Haffen and\r\nprosecuted them. Governor Hughes, basing his findings and action on the\r\nreport of Wallace Macfarlane, his Commissioner who heard the evidence,\r\nfound that the following charges had been established:\r\n\r\nThat Mr. Haffen had greatly abused his discretionary power in failing\r\nto enforce more stringently the time clauses of contracts for public\r\nimprovements, and that the time statements in his certificates to the\r\nFinance Department were in many cases untrue; that the public funds\r\nwere wasted by loading the payrolls of his department with a large\r\nnumber of superfluous employees; that there was political jobbery in\r\nthe building of the Bronx Borough Court House; the appointed architect\r\nwas essentially a politician without professional qualifications who\r\nhad hired others to do the architectural work. The granite contract\r\nfor this building was awarded to the Buck’s Harbor Granite Company,\r\nrepresented in New York by a Bronx Tammany district leader.\r\n\r\nAmong an array of further charges against Mr. Haffen that were found\r\ntrue was the charge that he was financially interested in the Sound\r\nView Land and Improvement Company, “and that his official action in\r\nconnection with the Clason’s Point Road was induced by his desire to\r\nincrease the value of his own and his associates’ holdings in this\r\ncompany, which had acquired a tract of forty-one acres with a frontage\r\nof 2,500 feet on the proposed road, with a view to that improvement.”\r\n\r\nAnother charge established against Mr. Haffen was that as borough\r\npresident and chairman of the local board of Morrisania, Mr. Haffen\r\nhad recommended the acquisition by New York City of certain property\r\nat Hunt’s Point on the East River Shore, for use as a public bathing\r\nplace. This property, Governor Hughes declared, was utterly unsuitable\r\nfor the purpose because of its proximity to a trunk sewer.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hughes set forth that the Hunt’s Point transaction was “a\r\nhighly discreditable affair. This shore property was about five acres\r\nin extent, and the assessed valuation was about $4,300. During the\r\ncondemnation proceedings the attorney for the company which owned\r\nit purchased it from his client for about $86,000.[4] It was then\r\ntransferred to another company, and was acquired by the city at a cost\r\nof about $247,000, the value fixed by the condemnation commissioners.”\r\nThus the award for the Hunt’s Point property was fifty-eight times the\r\nassessed value, and many times the actual value.\r\n\r\nOther charges against Mr. Haffen were sustained. Overtime charges on\r\ncontracts had been liquidated arbitrarily; on one occasion $70,000\r\nwas improperly remitted to “Bart” Dunn who previously had contributed\r\n$1,000 to the Haffen campaign fund.[5] Payments were made to\r\ncontractors on absolutely false statements certified from Mr. Haffen’s\r\noffice. Extravagance in the Bureau of Public Buildings and Offices\r\nresulted in an estimated waste of $175,000 of an available $292,000\r\nin six years of Mr. Haffen’s administration.[6] Contract juggling was\r\ncommon. Worn-out Belgian blocks were sold by the borough to contractors\r\nand then repurchased by the city as new. In cases where contractors\r\nwere friends of Mr. Haffen, contract specifications were so drawn as\r\nto exclude competitors. Streets were laid in irregular routes so as to\r\naid land development schemes in which Tammany men held control. Highway\r\ncontract specifications were deliberately violated by the contractors.\r\nThe labors of the maintenance force in the Bureau of Highways were\r\nwasted to such an extent that the investigators estimated a loss of 50\r\nper cent. in efficiency, or $1,600,000 in money, within six years.[7] A\r\nsimilar waste of $300,000 was attributed to the Bureau of Sewers in the\r\nsame period.\r\n\r\nBorough President Haffen was ousted by Governor Hughes on August\r\n29, 1909. When removed from office, Haffen complained, “This is a\r\nfine reward for twenty-six and a half years of honest, faithful and\r\nefficient service to the people.…”\r\n\r\nAnother high city official who went out of office during this time was\r\nJoseph Bermel, president of the Borough of Queens. He hastily resigned\r\nwhile under charges.\r\n\r\nMr. Bermel was not, strictly speaking, a Tammany man; he was an\r\nauxiliary satrap. His removal from office had been asked for by\r\nAttorney-General Jackson and Deputy Attorney-General Nathan Viadiver,\r\nof New York State, at the conclusion of an inquiry into Bermel’s office.\r\n\r\nBermel was charged by the Attorney General and by the Queen’s Borough\r\nProperty Owners’ Association with various acts. He was accused of\r\nconspiring with others to defraud New York City in the purchase or\r\nsale of land to New York City; he was charged with accepting money from\r\npersons interested in the sale of such lands, and was further charged\r\nwith selling and using his influence in the land purchases in question.\r\nHe was accused of failing to aid the Grand Jury in its investigations\r\ninto these transactions, and was further charged with blocking the\r\nprocedure of that body with his influence and money in refusing to\r\ntestify in certain matters, and in other cases testifying falsely and\r\nremoving his books from the Grand Jury’s jurisdiction. Another charge\r\nwas that he swore falsely concerning his bank deposits, which evidence\r\nhe sought to corroborate by the testimony of a witness who presented\r\napparent confirmation in the shape of a written paper, which paper upon\r\ninvestigation was proved to be a false and fraudulent document.\r\n\r\nStill further, Mr. Bermel was charged with receiving money for\r\ngranting special privileges to contractors; with neglecting pavements\r\nand permitting material of a lower grade than specified to be used\r\nin contract work; with purchasing supplies for public buildings at\r\nexorbitant prices and with allowing the same high prices to be charged\r\nfor repairs to public buildings. Additional charges were that he\r\nappointed incompetent subordinates and permitted persons who did no\r\nwork to draw salaries. Close upon the announcement from Albany that\r\nGovernor Hughes had appointed Samuel H. Ordway as Commissioner to take\r\ntestimony, Bermel on April 29, 1908, resigned from office.[8]\r\n\r\nThe Aldermen on April 30, 1908, elected Lawrence Gresser to fill Mr.\r\nBermel’s unexpired term as President of the Borough of Queens, and\r\non November 2, 1909, Mr. Gresser was elected by the people to that\r\noffice for the four ensuing years. In 1911 charges were preferred by\r\ncitizens of Queens County against Gresser. A number of these charges\r\nwere sustained by Samuel H. Ordway, the Commissioner appointed by the\r\nGovernor to take testimony and report. Commissioner Ordway, however,\r\nexplained in his report made June 16, 1911: “Of those [charges]\r\nthat are sustained, none, in my opinion, establishes corruption or\r\ndishonesty on the part of Mr. Gresser. I believe that he is an honest\r\nman and would not be a party to any corrupt acts either for his own\r\nbenefit or that of his associates. But I am of the opinion that he\r\nhas been inefficient and incompetent, and has been neglectful of his\r\nduty to protect the city and the Borough of Queens against fraud and\r\ncorruption on the part of his subordinates.”[9] After an argument\r\nmade by Robert S. Binkerd, Secretary of the City Club, asking for Mr.\r\nGresser’s removal, Governor Dix removed Gresser from office.\r\n\r\nBut Tammany men were not the only officials against whom charges were\r\nbrought. It had long been a subject of increasing general comment\r\nthat District Attorney Jerome, much noted as such a leading reformer,\r\nwho had been so conspicuously active in sending petty offenders to\r\nprison, had failed to bring about the conviction of any high insurance\r\nofficials and had not brought about the indictment of a single traction\r\nsystem manipulator.\r\n\r\nOn September 8, 1907, a voluminous petition was sent by various New\r\nYork business men and other citizens to Governor Hughes. This petition\r\nrecited in detail the specific transactions thus complained of, made\r\na scathing criticism of District Attorney Jerome for having failed to\r\nprosecute those responsible, and demanded that the Attorney General of\r\nNew York State be forthwith directed to bring prosecution.\r\n\r\nEvidence submitted, on December 1, 1907, to the Grand Jury in General\r\nSessions showed that Thomas F. Ryan and associates had bought in 1902\r\nfrom Anthony N. Brady for $250,000 the franchise of a company called\r\nthe Wall and Cortland Street Ferries Railroad Company, a corporation\r\nhaving a dormant franchise for a road that had never been built.[10]\r\nThey had then sold this franchise to a dummy corporation, called the\r\nMetropolitan Securities Company, for $965,607.19. Part of this sum went\r\nto the syndicate’s brokers; the precise amount of funds divided among\r\nRyan, Widener, Dolan and the estates of William C. Whitney and William\r\nL. Elkins was $692,292.82.[11] The surviving members of this group\r\nsubsequently settled the transaction by making restitution of this sum\r\nsoon after the facts had been made public and after charges had been\r\nmade against Jerome. On the very day that Mr. Ryan and associates had\r\nbought the non-existent Wall and Cortlandt Street Ferries Railroad,\r\nthey had also bought, for $1,600,000, the People’s Traction Company,\r\nowning a paper road never built, and the New York, Westchester and\r\nConnecticut Traction Company, a small railway, which a short time\r\npreviously had been sold in bankruptcy proceedings for $15,000.[12]\r\nIt was charged that in this transaction also, there was another grand\r\ndivision of funds.\r\n\r\nThese particular transactions, however, were in reality insignificant\r\ncompared to the disappearance of $16,000,000 from the treasury of the\r\nThird avenue Railway,[13] and vaster total transactions charged,\r\naggregating, as we have previously noted, about $90,000,000. The fact\r\nwas brought out in the investigation by the Public Service Commission\r\nthat all the books of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company in which\r\nits affairs from 1891 onward to 1902 were recorded, had been sold to\r\na purchaser who promised to destroy them.[14] Street car lines bought\r\nfor a few hundred thousand dollars were, it was charged, capitalized at\r\nten or twenty times that sum, and then followed a process by which vast\r\namounts were charged in duplication of construction accounts.\r\n\r\nLemuel Ely Quigg (who for six years had been a member of Congress)\r\nadmitted that in the four years preceding 1907 he had received $217,000\r\nfrom the Metropolitan Street Railway Company.[15] This was charged to\r\na construction fund, part of which was another sum of $798,000 paid\r\nto different persons whose names were concealed. Further facts in a\r\nlegislative investigation in 1910 (to which we shall hereafter refer)\r\nsupplied certain other missing links.\r\n\r\nNo criminal proceedings, however, were brought against Mr. Ryan. In\r\na statement published on May 26, 1909, Col. Amory averred that when\r\na Grand Jury was called in 1907 to investigate the acts of Ryan and\r\nassociates of the Metropolitan Street Railway Company, the foreman of\r\nthe Grand Jury was a director in Mr. Ryan’s Equitable Life Assurance\r\nSociety. Col. Amory also made the accusation that in April, 1903,\r\nDaniel Mason, Mr. Jerome’s former law partner, and William H. Page,\r\nJr., another of the Metropolitan’s lawyers, had attempted to bribe\r\nhim (Amory) while a State’s witness, with $200,000, to withdraw the\r\ncharges that Amory had filed with Jerome against the Metropolitan\r\nStreet Railway Company. On January 27, 1908, Judge Rosalsky, in the\r\nCourt of General Sessions, severely arraigned District Attorney Jerome,\r\ndeclaring that Jerome had so conducted the examination of Thomas F.\r\nRyan before the Grand Jury as probably to invalidate any indictments\r\nwhich that body might have found against Ryan. Paul D. Cravath,\r\nGovernor Hughes’s former law partner, was now Ryan’s astute attorney.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hughes appointed a Commissioner to hear the evidence upon\r\nwhich the charges against Mr. Jerome were made. Jerome admitted that\r\nwhen Ryan, Brady and Vreeland were before the Grand Jury he had put\r\nleading questions to them. Further he testified that he had not asked\r\nthe Grand Jury to indict Ryan in the matter of the Wall Street and\r\nCortlandt Street Ferries Railway transactions. Interrogated as to a\r\ncertain contribution made to his campaign fund by Samuel Untermeyer,\r\ncounsel for Mr. Hyde of the Equitable Life Assurance Society, Mr.\r\nJerome denied that any ulterior purpose was behind it. Mr. Ryan\r\nadmitted on the witness stand that he (Ryan) had contributed heavily to\r\nthe national fund of the Democratic party in 1900.\r\n\r\nThe Commissioner’s report exonerated Jerome, and Governor Hughes\r\ndismissed the charges, saying, “Nothing has been presented which\r\nfurnishes any just ground for impeaching the good faith of the District\r\nAttorney in connection with any of the transactions set forth, nor has\r\nanything been shown which would justify his removal from office.” The\r\noutcome was severely criticized by some of the very newspapers which\r\nhad once enthusiastically supported Mr. Jerome. Col. Amory wrote that\r\nthere were other bribes than money bribes, and that he did not believe\r\nMr. Jerome capable of doing a corrupt act for money.[16] Whatever the\r\nfundamental facts, the consequences were clear: great sums of money\r\nhad undeniably vanished, a group of magnates had become additionally\r\nenriched, the street railway system was wrecked and thrown into\r\nbankruptcy, the statute of limitations had meanwhile been interposed,\r\nand nobody had been prosecuted.\r\n\r\nThese were the essential facts, and they were facts that, after all\r\nexplanations, could not be evaded. Mr. Jerome himself was forced to\r\nrecognize them in his own defense; in his public speeches he took\r\ngreat pains to assure his hearers that acts might be wrong and yet not\r\ncriminal, but it was an explanation not favorably received in general.\r\nThe great change in public opinion was forcibly shown, when, at a\r\nmeeting in Cooper Union, on May 26, 1909, Mr. Jerome was badly heckled\r\nand asked the most pointed questions as to why he had not prosecuted\r\nthe traction magnates.\r\n\r\nThe city finances during these years were in a bewilderingly deplorable\r\nstate. On December 31, 1907, the total amount remaining uncollected\r\nfrom the tax levies covering the years 1899 to 1907, inclusive, was\r\n$90,545,000. In addition, a sum of $12,289,000 remained uncollected\r\nfrom the tax levies prior to the year 1899.[17] Notwithstanding these\r\nactual enormous deficiencies, the amounts placed in the tax levies,\r\nfrom the years 1899 to 1905 inclusive, to provide for possible\r\ndeficiencies in tax collections, was only $11,719,000. During that very\r\nperiod the amounts in discounts, remissions and cancelations amounted\r\nto $12,477,000, which was more than $758,000 in excess of the amount\r\nplaced in the tax levies to provide for deficiencies in collections.\r\n“In other words,” reported a Select Legislative Committee, “the amounts\r\nplaced in the tax levies during those years to provide for deficiencies\r\nin collections, did not even equal the discounts, cancelations and\r\nremissions, and made no provision whatever for failure or inability to\r\ncollect taxes levied.”[18]\r\n\r\nBy October 31, 1908, uncollected taxes due the city (including\r\n$9,324,000 personal taxes for years previous to 1898, which had been\r\nwritten off as uncollectable), amounted to $84,506,000. Despite the\r\nfact that this huge sum had not been collected, the city officials\r\nspent the greater part of it as though it had been collected; of the\r\n$84,506,000 uncollected, the sum of $76,266,000 had, by October 31,\r\n1908, been expended by the city in appropriations included in budgets\r\nwhich, in reality, ought to have been defrayed by these uncollected\r\ntaxes.[19]\r\n\r\nBasing their action on these uncollected taxes, the city officials\r\nhad issued, from time to time, large amounts in revenue bonds with\r\nwhich to get money to pay the appropriations in the yearly budgets.\r\nOn October 31, 1908, there was outstanding against these arrears of\r\ntaxes $40,606,000 of revenue bonds. This left a balance of $35,660,000\r\nwhich had been expended by the city for current expenses, but which\r\nhad neither been collected nor procured by revenue bonds.[20] The\r\nSelect Legislative Committee commented upon the fact that although\r\nthe evidence proved conclusively that not more than 65 per cent. of\r\npersonal taxes were collectable, yet the city budget had nearly equaled\r\nthe entire levy in each year.[21] Furthermore, the sum of $24,521,000\r\nin special franchise taxes had not been collected by December 31, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe sources of a certain $33,000,000 which had been spent by the city\r\npuzzled the Select Legislative Committee. Just how this money was\r\nobtained the Committee was not able to ascertain.\r\n\r\nBut, the Committee added, it was shown that the assessment account\r\nfor local improvements was depleted to the amount of $1,900,000.\r\nThere should have been a sum of $600,000 comprising trust funds,\r\nvarious bequests, intestate estates, etc., but it could not be found.\r\nAlso, there should have been in the city treasury $3,800,000 more\r\nas a special account including deposits made with the city against\r\ncontractors’ liability for restoring and repaving streets and the\r\nunliquidated balance of the Brooklyn fund. But this $3,800,000 “did\r\nnot exist.” The accounts of the various boroughs revealed a shortage\r\nof $1,500,000; excise funds were short $5,100,000; the account of\r\nunexpended proceeds of the bond account disclosed a shortage of\r\n$7,200,000, and the account of that part of the unexpended bond\r\naccounts which had not been allotted was short $8,250,000.[22] making\r\n“The Controller’s office,” the Select Legislative Committee reported,\r\n“was unable within any reasonable time to determine from what funds\r\nthe remaining $4,000,000 had been taken, up the total shortage of\r\n$33,000,000. But the net result is certain, that for the payment of\r\nrunning expenses over a long period of years, the City has taken the\r\ntotal amount of $29,000,000 from specific funds set apart for other\r\npurposes, shifting the resulting deficits from one fund to another as\r\noccasion required.”[23]\r\n\r\nLarge issues of corporate stock were also made for other than permanent\r\nimprovements.[24]\r\n\r\nThe city budget appropriations had grown enormously. In 1898 the amount\r\nwas $70,175,896. By 1909 it had mounted to $156,545,148, an increase of\r\nmore than $86,000,000, or approximately 123 per cent. Yet the increase\r\nin population had been only about 39.4 per cent.[25]\r\n\r\nVast sums were squandered in the purchasing of city supplies and in\r\na multitude of other ways. Condemnation proceedings were a source\r\nof great scandal. There was the Catskill reservoir and aqueduct to\r\nsupply New York with water, the estimated cost of which undertaking\r\nwas $162,000,000. “Rings” of politicians bought land which they\r\nsold to the city at high prices. For the one item of advertising\r\n“public notices” of condemnation proceedings, the cost already had\r\napproximated $800,000.[26] In three years the fees paid to certain\r\nCatskill reservoir and aqueduct commissioners appointed to condemn\r\nland, aggregated $169,490, and this amount did not include the fees of\r\ncommissioners who had not yet reported.[27] During the same period the\r\nfees paid to commissioners in New York City street and park opening\r\nproceedings totalled more than $384,000, while fees paid in other\r\ncondemnation proceedings (exclusive of the Dock Department) aggregated\r\nmore than $300,000.[28]\r\n\r\nLarge as these sums were, they were but a fraction of the total amounts\r\npocketed by all of the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nThe city payroll was padded with an extraordinarily large number of\r\nsuperfluous employees. In a separate memorandum to the Legislative\r\nCommittee report, Mr. William M. Bennet, a member of that committee,\r\nquoted Controller Metz’s statement in 1909 that from 25 to 50 per\r\ncent. of New York City’s payroll, then totalling $80,000,000 a year,\r\nwas “useless.”[29] At this time (in 1909) New York City’s actual debt\r\nreached $800,000,000.[30] In many directions “Organization” men were\r\nfaring richly. Even though Mayor McClellan was fighting Leader Murphy,\r\nTammany held sway in many administrative and court departments, not\r\nincluded in the Mayor’s jurisdiction, and he had certain reasons for\r\nplacating some Tammany district leaders.\r\n\r\nAfter declaring his independence of “Boss” Murphy, Mayor McClellan,\r\nsupported by Senator McCarren, of Brooklyn, had begun a contest--futile\r\nenough, as it turned out--to get control of Tammany Hall. According to\r\na magazine article[31] written by General Theodore A. Bingham, Police\r\nCommissioner during Mayor McClellan’s second administration, Mayor\r\nMcClellan “knew full well that the most effective weapon was the power\r\nand patronage at his disposal, by virtue of his office. When he tried\r\nto use the police I objected.” Dismissed by Mayor McClellan from the\r\noffice of Police Commissioner, Mr. Bingham soon after set forth his\r\nexperiences in the published article in question.\r\n\r\n“In all election contests,” wrote General Bingham further,\r\n\r\n    “whether it be a primary election, a municipal election, or\r\n    a State or a National election, the police are a factor. The\r\n    district leader who can control the majority of the uniformed\r\n    men on duty in his bailiwick is not apt to have much trouble in\r\n    fighting off rival candidates. He has a most influential body\r\n    of men working for him 365 days in the year.\r\n\r\n    “The baneful influence of the ordinary Tammany district leader\r\n    in a single precinct station house is far-reaching. When he\r\n    can do favors, or persuade the men that he can do them, his\r\n    influence is something beyond belief. Some leaders have had\r\n    more authority in some police stations than the executive head\r\n    of the department. They have been looked upon as the men from\r\n    whom to take orders. They have often visited the station not\r\n    only to give bail for unlucky constituents, but to give orders\r\n    to the captains and lieutenants.\r\n\r\n    “Policemen as a whole are the most gullible persons in the\r\n    entire City Government when it comes to the question of\r\n    the power of the political ‘boss.’ This is not surprising.\r\n    Experience has taught them that if they displease the local\r\n    powers they are apt to be transferred to a distant precinct.\r\n    Therefore, they fear to take a chance. The wily leader takes\r\n    advantage of this weakness. He uses his power at every\r\n    opportunity, and when he meets with opposition he is prompt\r\n    with his threats. Suppose, in the course of time, the offending\r\n    policeman is shifted as a matter of routine. Then the leader\r\n    struts about telling this offender’s fellow officers that he,\r\n    the leader, had the man transferred.” And if a policeman showed\r\n    independence, Mr. Bingham asserted, a word from the leader to\r\n    the superior officers caused “complaints to be made, extra\r\n    hours of duty, unpleasant details and the like, until the man’s\r\n    life is made miserable.”\r\n\r\nGeneral Bingham declared that he had labored to stamp out these abuses,\r\nbut unavailingly. “So bad did this political influence become in some\r\nprecincts in Manhattan after Mayor McClellan began his contests at\r\nthe primaries for the leadership of Tammany Hall, that I had to make\r\nradical changes in the personnel of those districts.”\r\n\r\nIt was absurdly easy for Mr. Murphy and his Tammany machine leaders\r\nto squelch Mayor McClellan’s plans for leadership. No auspicious time\r\nwas it, however, to nominate a “regular Organization man” for Mayor;\r\nrespectability had to be invoked and a hack politician obviously\r\nwould not serve the purpose. Besides, there was resistance from\r\nSenator McCarren’s Brooklyn organization against the nomination of a\r\ndistinctively Tammany “Organization” creature.\r\n\r\nThe candidate of Tammany Hall and its allies was William J. Gaynor. A\r\nBrooklyn lawyer, he had signalized his early career by causing John Y.\r\nMcKane, then Democratic “boss” of Coney Island, to be convicted and\r\nimprisoned for ballot box frauds and for defying a court injunction.\r\nElected to the State Supreme Court, Gaynor was a member of that\r\nbody when nominated for Mayor; and by his constant exposures of the\r\ntyrannies and abuses committed by the police force he had become widely\r\nand favorably known as a man opposed to “The System.” Thus, Tammany\r\ncould depict its candidate as a genuine and proved reformer. But apart\r\nfrom these representations, Gaynor was, in fact, a man of intellect,\r\nforce and independence of character, deep understanding of public\r\nquestions and of progressive, even advanced, views. A far different\r\ntype he was from the usual run of ignorant grafting politicians.\r\n\r\nBy his strong denunciations of the looting done by surface-railway\r\nmanipulators and by his emphatic declarations in favor of the building\r\nby the city itself of further subways, Gaynor won a large following.\r\nHe seemed uncommonly sincere when he caustically arraigned the\r\ncombination of railway promoters and financiers who, he said, were busy\r\nat the “old game” of seeking to enrich themselves manifold more by\r\ngetting additional traction franchises. “My friends,” he asserted in a\r\nspeech in Tammany Hall, on October 19, 1909, “we are going to build the\r\nsubways. We do not intend that a single subway or a franchise for it\r\nshall be passed over to any of these men.” He made other pronouncements\r\nto the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe pushful, insistent Mr. Hearst was still backed by a political\r\norganization, now passing under the name of the Civic Alliance, but\r\nhis course in accepting Mr. Murphy’s and Tammany’s support during his\r\ncandidacy for Governor after having bitterly assailed them in previous\r\ncampaigns when he was an independent candidate, had effectually\r\nalienated many of his former followers. By reason of the influence\r\nof his newspapers, he still, however, had considerable strength. He\r\nwas the nominee of the Civic Alliance for Mayor. The Republican and\r\nFusion candidate was Otto Bannard, a banker. Edward F. Cassidy was\r\nthe Socialist Party’s candidate. One of the issues put forward by the\r\nFusion campaigners was the continuing abominations of the “white slave”\r\ntraffic, operated, it was asserted, with the connivance of the police.\r\n\r\nGaynor was elected. The vote resulted: Gaynor, 250,378; Bannard,\r\n177,304; Hearst, 154,187; Cassidy, 11,768; Hunter (Socialist Labor)\r\n1,256; Manierre (Prohibition) 866. Although, however, Gaynor won,\r\nyet by the election of many of the Fusion candidates (to the offices\r\nof Controller, President of the Board of Aldermen and presidents\r\nof boroughs) Tammany lost control of nearly all of the borough\r\npresidencies, and in turn of many of the departments and of the\r\npowerful Board of Estimate. In this Board Tammany now had only three\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] When Ahearn was elected president of the Borough of Manhattan,\r\nit was “Boss” Murphy, with the “advice and consent” of the Tammany\r\nExecutive Committee, who really chose his appointees to head the\r\nDepartment of Public Work, the Bureau of Highways, the Bureau of\r\nSewers, the Bureau of Buildings, etc. Of course, Tammany district\r\nleaders were appointed; they were really responsible to the Tammany\r\nExecutive Committee.\r\n\r\n[2] See _A Report on a Special Examination of the Accounts and Methods\r\nof the Office of the President of the Borough of Manhattan, Directed by\r\nHon.

Flannery. Upon\r\ncharges preferred by the Bar Association, and after a three years’\r\ninvestigation, he was disbarred, May 17, 1912, by the Appellate\r\nDivision of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. He was found\r\nguilty on five of the six charges brought against him, one of which\r\ncharges dealt with the notorious Hunt’s Point land “job.” It was on\r\nrecord that Flannery personally profited to the sum of $300,000 from\r\nvarious transactions of land sold to the city at fictitious valuations.\r\nOn June 11, 1914, W. D. Guthrie, representing the New York Bar\r\nAssociation, reiterated the charges when he argued before the Court of\r\nAppeals at Albany for the confirmation of Mr. Flannery’s disbarment.\r\nFlannery’s attorney declared that nobody was misled or labored under a\r\nmisapprehension as a result of his client’s actions; that the company\r\nfor which Flannery was attorney knew as much about the transaction as\r\ndid Flannery. On October 24, 1914, the Court of Appeals sanctioned\r\nFlannery’s disbarment.\r\n\r\n[5] _Summary of Findings, A Report on a Special Examination of the\r\nOffice of the President of the Borough of the Bronx, etc. Commissioners\r\nof Accounts, June 16, 1908_, p. 1.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[7] _Ibid._, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[8] He had been elected Borough President of Queens in 1905, after a\r\nfight upon “Joe” Cassidy, long Democratic “boss” of Queens, in which\r\ncampaign Bermel ran as an “Independent Democrat” and had violently\r\ndenounced “Cassidyism and public graft.”\r\n\r\n[9] _In the Matter of Charges Preferred against Lawrence Gresser,\r\nPresident of the Borough of Queens, City of New York, Report of\r\nCommissioner Samuel H.

Hotchkiss, State Superintendent of Insurance, followed by\r\nthat of a New York Legislative committee into the matter of legislative\r\ngraft, revealed the extensive and variegated corruption of both\r\npolitical parties.\r\n\r\nAn examination by Mr. Hotchkiss, in October, 1909, of the affairs of\r\nthe Phœnix Insurance Company of Brooklyn had brought to light a mass\r\nof correspondence apparently disclosing an intimate connection between\r\nthe president of that company and legislative measures, introduced from\r\n1900 to 1910, affecting fire insurance companies. The materials thus\r\nunearthed caused Superintendent Hotchkiss to order a full examination\r\nof the books and records of other fire insurance companies, which\r\nexamination was begun in January, 1910.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 1910, the New York _Evening Post_ published certain\r\nfacts the purport of which tended to show that State Senator Jotham P.\r\nAllds, when Republican leader of the Assembly, in 1901, had been bribed\r\nto assist in killing certain legislation to which bridge construction\r\ncompanies objected. The Senate was forced to investigate, and Allds\r\nhastily resigned, but the Senate on March 29, 1910, sustained the\r\ncharge of bribery by a vote of 40 to 9.\r\n\r\nIt was well understood that this virtuous action was “a sacrifice” and\r\nan ostentatious sop to public opinion; many more legislators than he\r\nwere implicated in charges of corruption. Meanwhile, Mr. Hotchkiss\r\nwas persisting in his investigation. In the course of Mr. Hotchkiss’\r\ninquiry, on March 22, 1910, testimony developed the fact that for\r\ntwenty years or more, “firebug” funds had been raised by insurance\r\ncompanies and lavishly distributed among legislators at Albany and that\r\nthose companies had employed one William H. Buckley to act as “watcher”\r\non “strike bills” introduced in the Legislature at Albany. Buckley\r\nadmitted that at a time after only three years’ admission to the bar,\r\nhe had received $27,000 from insurance companies for representing them\r\nduring the sessions of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nOne of the bills introduced in the Legislature was a measure fathered\r\nby Senator Thomas F. Grady, a noted Tammany leader, celebrated as\r\nthe chief orator of the Tammany organization. This bill, called a\r\nre-insurance act, was introduced and passed under such circumstances\r\nthat Vice-President Correa of the Home Insurance Company referred\r\nto it in a contemporary letter as “bought legislation.” Mr. Correa\r\nalso stated in that letter, which was in evidence, that only three\r\nre-insured fire insurance companies supported the bill, which gave\r\nthose three companies a distinct advantage over 209 direct insurance\r\ncompanies doing business in New York State. The bill dealt with the\r\ncarrying of a reserve where part of a fire risk was re-insured. Senator\r\nGrady declared, in a public interview, that this bill was introduced to\r\nprotect policy holders by compelling the re-insurance company, when a\r\npart of a policy was farmed out by the company of the first instance,\r\nto keep an adequate reserve against the policy thus taken, but all\r\nof the insurance officers examined by Mr. Hotchkiss admitted either\r\nwholly or in part, that Grady’s interview did not represent a correct\r\nconception of what his bill actually provided.[1]\r\n\r\nAnother conspicuous Tammany leader implicated in the disclosures before\r\nSuperintendent Hotchkiss was Senator “Big Tim” Sullivan. He had long\r\nbeen one of the really powerful leaders of Tammany Hall, and held\r\ndirect sovereignty over the teeming East Side below Fourteenth Street.\r\n\r\nBeginning life as a bartender, “Big Tim” Sullivan had been given the\r\nnickname “Dry Dollar” Sullivan, because of his habit of carefully\r\nwiping the bar before placing change on it. His career in the Assembly\r\nand Senate was notorious for the number of bad bills promoted or\r\nsupported by him. His power in manipulating primaries and swaying\r\nelections on the East Side south of Fourteenth Street was recognized\r\nas that of a master hand; he knew how to make the “gangs” his obedient\r\nservants; not a secret of colonizing voters and carrying elections was\r\nunknown to him and his clan; at the same time he was called “the friend\r\nof the poor” because of his yearly practise of giving the wastrels\r\nof the Bowery and vicinity Thanksgiving and Christmas dinners and\r\npresents. By his proved and consistent ability to sway politics in the\r\ngreat and thickly-populated East Side, he had to be recognized as an\r\nindependent Tammany power; no one could become “boss” of Tammany Hall\r\nwithout his support. His power in Tammany was exceeded only by Mr.\r\nMurphy’s. In fact, he was one of the actual rulers, not only of Tammany\r\nHall, but of New York City.\r\n\r\nGeorge F. Seward, president of the Fidelity and Casualty Company,\r\ntestified on March 21, 1910, before Superintendent Hotchkiss, that a\r\nman representing himself to be an agent of Senator “Big Tim” Sullivan,\r\nin 1891 or 1892, offered, in return for a $10,000 bribe, to have a\r\nbill inimical to that company’s interests killed. Mr. Seward, in\r\nresponse, dictated this telegram to Sullivan: “Mr. Seward says you can\r\ngo to hell.” In reply to a question as to whether this happened when\r\nthe Republican party or the Democratic party was in power, Mr. Seward\r\nreplied, “So far as either party is concerned, I don’t think it would\r\nmake very much difference, and I really do not recall.” Both parties,\r\nMr. Seward said, were represented in the “Black Horse Cavalry” at\r\nAlbany. In a public interview Sullivan denounced Mr. Seward’s charge\r\nas a lie. Recalled as a witness, on March 22, 1910, Seward adhered to\r\nthe story he had told. It may be remarked here that when Sullivan died\r\nin 1913, he left a considerable fortune, originally estimated at two\r\nmillions of dollars; his friends represented that he had made it from\r\na chain of showhouses in which he was interested; but the inventory\r\nshowed that he owned large quantities of stock in mining companies,\r\nrealty companies and other concerns. Many of these shares, however,\r\nwere listed by the executors of his estate as valueless. The definite\r\nvalue of Sullivan’s estate was placed at $1,021,277.33.\r\n\r\nOn March 24, 1910, certain definite facts were brought out showing\r\nhow Buckley, lobbyist at Albany for the fire insurance companies, had\r\nsucceeded in killing, in 1903, various proposed enactments which those\r\ncompanies did not want enacted.\r\n\r\nCorrespondence produced showed that Buckley had written to George P.\r\nSheldon, president of the Phœnix Insurance Company, that “it was not\r\ndifficult to tie the matter [insurance bills] up in the committee,” and\r\nlater correspondence held out the assurance that the matter “had been\r\narranged.” According to the testimony, Justice Edward E. McCall of the\r\nNew York State Supreme Court had indorsed a $35,000 check from Sheldon\r\nto Buckley. On March 29, 1910, Darwin P. Kingsley, president of the\r\nNew York Life Insurance Company, testified that Buckley had offered to\r\nbuy him the votes of six members of the New York State Senate for a\r\ncertain amount, and that when he (Kingsley) declined to pay, a certain\r\ninsurance measure which Kingsley had favored was withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThese are but a few of the specific details brought out in the\r\nhearings before Mr. Hotchkiss; it appeared that at least ten prominent\r\nRepublican legislators who had ruled important Senate and Assembly\r\nCommittees for years had speculative accounts in the brokerage firm\r\nof Ellingwood & Cunningham of New York City, in which firm G. Tracy\r\nRogers, keeper of the traction “Yellow Dog” fund during that period,\r\nwas a special partner.\r\n\r\nOn April 8, 1910, State Superintendent of Insurance Hotchkiss made a\r\nfull report to Governor Hughes of the investigation that he had made.\r\nMr. Hotchkiss reported that the aggregate of disbursements by fire\r\ninsurance companies in connection with legislation affecting those\r\ncompanies, from 1901 to 1909, probably exceeded $150,000.\r\n\r\n“The moneys so paid,” Mr. Hotchkiss reported, “were disbursed for\r\ntraveling expenses of individuals and delegations; annual and special\r\nretainers of regular counsels; so-called retainers of legislative\r\nlawyers; contributions to political committees; gifts or payments to\r\nmen of political prominence and influence, and entertaining legislators\r\nand others, at times in a somewhat lavish manner.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hotchkiss further set forth in his report that the log rolling of\r\n“strike” bills in and out of committees was a regular business, that\r\nthe books of the stock brokerage house of Ellingwood & Cunningham,\r\nNew York City, “warrant a strong suspicion that such books, to an\r\nextent at least, had been a clearing house for financial transactions\r\nconnected with legislation during the period mentioned,” and that G.\r\nTracy Rogers, a special partner in the firm and long president of the\r\nStreet Railways Association of the State of New York, seemed up to\r\nthe time of the failure of that firm “to have been the legislative\r\nrepresentative at Albany of the traction interests.” Mr. Hotchkiss\r\nreported that: “Certain of the accounts in these ledgers show a close\r\nconnection between G. Tracy Rogers and the Metropolitan traction\r\ninterests in New York City. The character of the securities dealt in\r\n[by legislators] frequently recalls legislation urged or retarded at\r\nabout the same time.” Mr. Hotchkiss urged further inquiry, and in a\r\nspecial message to the Legislature, on April 11, 1910, Governor Hughes\r\ncalled on that body to follow, by means of a general investigation, the\r\ntrails of legislative corruption laid bare by the Allds bribery trial\r\nand the investigation conducted by Superintendent Hotchkiss.\r\n\r\nIn the face of the exposures already made and the insistent demands\r\nfor further investigation, the legislative committee appointed for the\r\npurpose could not evade pressing the inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe testimony on September 15, 1910, showed that during a single month\r\nin the summer of 1903, the sum of $40,000 was sent by an agent of the\r\nNew York City street railway interests to the firm of Ellingwood &\r\nCunningham, and that no vouchers or receipts were asked or given to\r\naccount for the distribution of the money. At previous hearings, the\r\nfact had been established that this brokerage house was the firm which\r\nserved as a “clearing-house” for the money supplied to members of the\r\nLegislature by G. Tracy Rogers. At the hearing on September 16, 1910,\r\nthe evidence showed that Senator Louis F. Goodsell and Assemblyman\r\nLouis Bedell, prominent Republican leaders in the Legislature, had\r\nreceived large amounts of money from the Metropolitan Street Railway\r\nCompany and G. Tracy Rogers from 1900 to 1904; Goodsell had received\r\n$24,800, and Bedell $21,750. Goodsell admitted that he had “bought”\r\nstock without putting up any margin.\r\n\r\nAt the same hearing, H. H. Vreeland, president of the Metropolitan\r\nStreet Railway Company, testified that the Metropolitan Street Railway\r\nCompany contributed campaign funds, and that it did so to practically\r\nevery one that ran for office; he remembered $20,000 or $25,000 given\r\nto the Republican organization and $17,000 or $18,000 to the Democratic\r\norganization; this was in about the year 1902 or 1903. Another method\r\nof subsidizing politicians individually, Mr. Vreeland testified, was\r\nby carrying stocks on the books of various brokerage houses for them;\r\nthese individual stock transactions ran from $20,000 to more than\r\n$30,000.\r\n\r\nMuch further testimony was brought out showing the enormous and\r\ncontinuous subsidizing of both old political parties and politicians\r\nby corporations wanting certain legislation enacted or smothered. On\r\nSeptember 21, 1910, Mr. Vreeland admitted that the Metropolitan Street\r\nRailway Company had, prior to 1903, paid out fully $250,000 in “taking\r\nup” stocks that legislators and other politicians had been carrying\r\nwith brokerage houses and which they desired converted into cash; this\r\nwas one of the indirect methods of influencing political or legislative\r\naction in the interest of the company. G. Tracy Rogers testified that\r\nhe had disbursed $82,475 in three years, and that most of it went to\r\nmembers of the railroad committees of the New York Legislature. In\r\nthese hearings the names of a number of conspicuous legislators and the\r\namounts received by them were brought out in the testimony.\r\n\r\nTestimony, also under oath, on October 19, 1910, purported to show that\r\na legislative corruption fund of $500,000 was raised at a meeting in\r\nDelmonico’s to defeat anti-race track gambling legislation at Albany\r\nin 1908; that Charles H. Hyde,[2] Chamberlain of New York City under\r\nMayor Gaynor, attended this meeting, and that State Senator Frank\r\nGardner went to Albany with Hyde because Hyde did not know the ways of\r\nlegislators and how to approach them “properly.”\r\n\r\nHyde’s father-in-law was William A. Engeman, owner of the Brighton\r\nBeach race track; according to the testimony, Hyde made a subscription\r\nfor Engeman (who had failed to pay), and later put in a bill for\r\npersonal expenses covering the amount. The testimony further\r\nrepresented that there was a dispute as to who was to handle the\r\nbribery funds, and that $125,000 was given to James E. Gaffney “to\r\ntake care of three or four members of the Legislature--Tammany men.”\r\nAccording further to the testimony, Senator Thomas F. Grady, Democratic\r\nleader at Albany and close friend and spokesman of “Boss” Murphy,\r\nreceived only $4,000 of the bribery fund. Two Republican State Senators\r\nwanted $25,000 each. The testimony also involved Senator Patrick H.\r\nMcCarren. Senator McCarren was the Democratic “boss” of Brooklyn;\r\nhe was an ally of Tammany Hall (for the Democratic organization in\r\nBrooklyn retained its autonomy separate from that of Tammany Hall, yet\r\nallied with it), and he was the legislative agent of various financial\r\ninterests and trusts.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, according to the testimony, that Senator McCarren was\r\nangry that the handling of the race track fund was entrusted to others;\r\nhe objected “to a strange man going up there, expecting to get away\r\nwith such a proposition,” but later he was placated and lent his aid\r\nagainst the bill. When urging Senator Foelker, a Brooklyn Republican,\r\nto vote against the bill, McCarren was represented as saying to\r\nFoelker: “You need not fear the indignation of your constituents. If\r\nyou are afraid of possible reelection or have any doubts about election\r\ntime, I think I can fix it up for you so you can name your own opponent\r\nat the coming election.” This was the substance of the testimony of\r\nAssistant District Attorney Robert Elder, of Brooklyn, who narrated\r\nthe facts revealed to him by former State Senator Frank Gardner, under\r\nindictment charged with attempting to bribe Foelker. (Here the fact\r\nshould be noted that when Gardner was tried on this charge he was\r\nacquitted on February 23, 1911.) Mr. Foelker himself testified that he\r\nwas offered $45,000 and then $50,000 to vote against the bill, which\r\noffer he refused; the vote on the bill was extremely close, and a\r\nsingle vote meant its passage or defeat.\r\n\r\nAt further hearings of the Legislative “Graft Hunt” Committee, Senator\r\nEugene M. Travis, of Brooklyn, testified that an ineffectual effort\r\nhad been made, at a time when the foes of the measure needed only one\r\nor two votes, to bribe him with $100,000 to vote against the bill\r\nprohibiting horse racing in New York State. Senator Travis specified\r\nthree other Senators whom they attempted to bribe. August Belmont\r\ntestified that the $500,000 fund was “mythical and absurd.” It was\r\nreported that representations made at the hearing on November 30, 1910,\r\nwere to the effect that one jockey club alone had expended $33,000\r\nwhile the anti-race track gambling legislation was pending, and that\r\ninformation from reliable sources tended to show that each of the other\r\nseven racing associations had expended a similar sum, or perhaps more.\r\nFurther information, it was given out, was to the effect that each of\r\nninety-three bookmakers had subscribed $3,000 each. The total of the\r\nabove stated contributions would have amounted to $543,000--supposing\r\nthe fund to have been a fact.\r\n\r\nWhatever were the basic facts, pro and con, as to the alleged $500,000\r\nfund for the defeat of the anti-race-track bill, the record shows that\r\nit was defeated on April 8, 1908, by a-vote of 25 to 25, and that\r\namong those voting against it were such Tammany Senators as Grady,\r\nFrawley, McManus, Sullivan and other Tammany men and Democrats,--in\r\nall seventeen Democrats and eight Republicans. A new State Senator\r\nhaving been elected in a special election in one district, the bill\r\nprohibiting gambling at race tracks was subsequently passed.\r\n\r\nNearly all of those involved made vehement denials. Senator McCarren\r\nhad died on October 23, 1909--a year before these hearings. Although\r\ncooperating with “Boss” Murphy in elections, there was nevertheless\r\nconsiderable animosity between the two, arising, it was generally\r\nbelieved, from a suspicion that Mr. Murphy, inflated by his personal\r\nvictory in electing McClellan in 1903, was attempting to extend\r\nhis political territory to Brooklyn. Senator McCarren had openly\r\nprotested against this “encroachment” and had threatened trouble if\r\nit were pushed. It was this jealously vigilant attitude on the part\r\nof the bosses of the other boroughs which prevented Tammany Hall from\r\nextending its regular organization outside the former city limits.\r\n\r\nMcCarren himself was a “sporting man” and reputed to be a\r\n“thoroughbred” at that. He had his own elaborate racing stable, and it\r\nwas said of him that he once uncomplainingly lost $30,000 on a bet,\r\nalthough the decision of the racing judges was open to question. In\r\n1908 the failure of the brokerage firm of Ennis & Stoppani revealed\r\nthe fact that McCarren was “carrying” $250,000 worth of stock, for\r\nwhich he had paid nothing, and which resulted in a loss to him of\r\nabout $107,000. No demand had been made by the brokers upon McCarren\r\nfor margins; in view of this fact he could not have been compelled\r\nto pay losses; it was said of him, however, that he gave a check to\r\nthe receiver and took the stock. He was a “heavy operator” in real\r\nestate and in the stock market, and had personal relations with H. H.\r\nRogers, Anthony N. Brady, William C. Whitney, J. Pierpont Morgan, W.\r\nK. Vanderbilt, August Belmont and other Wall Street magnates, of whose\r\ninterests he was a recognized pusher in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the hearings of the Legislative “Graft Hunt”\r\nCommittee: facts brought out showed that the beet sugar interests had\r\nalso debauched the Legislature and that State Senator John Raines, a\r\nleading Republican, received $9,000 in two years for pushing bounty\r\nbills to aid beet sugar interests. These facts were admitted by Henry\r\nF. Zimmerlin, former vice-president and Albany lobbyist of the Lyons\r\nBeet Sugar Refining Company.\r\n\r\nThe full testimony tended to show that insurance companies, traction\r\ncompanies, construction companies and other interests paid large\r\nsums to defeat legislation that they did not want enacted, or were\r\nblackmailed into paying other large sums to have “strike bills”\r\nsuppressed. But the report of the Legislative Investigating Committee,\r\nmade on February 1, 1911, was harmless as far as specific findings of\r\ncorruption were concerned. As to the charges of traction and race track\r\ncorruption, the Committee reported that no definite and substantial\r\ncharge, verified by knowledge, had been filed with it, and that “in\r\nconsequence it finds nothing definite in regard to the traction\r\nand race track charges that it examined.”[3] There were one or two\r\nindictments, but no one, either bribers or bribed, had to go prison,\r\nalthough in charges made in a detached subsequent case, one solitary\r\nState Senator, Stilwell, was convicted of bribery charges and sentenced\r\nto prison; he was a comparatively obscure politician.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the Legislature for years had been dominantly Republican,\r\nthese disclosures had a much more injurious political effect upon the\r\nRepublican organization than upon Tammany, and they were of weight in\r\nbringing about the election of a Democratic Governor in the person of\r\nJohn A. Dix, in 1910. This was the first Democratic Governor of New\r\nYork State elected in many years; the result was the enlargement of\r\nTammany’s sway, and more offices and further fields of power and profit\r\nfor “the Organization.”\r\n\r\nAt the same time, a Legislature, the majority of which were Tammany men\r\nand Democrats, was elected. The election of a United States Senator\r\ncoming up, the chief aspirant pushed for the place was William F.\r\nSheehan, an attorney for the traction magnate, Thomas F. Ryan. Mr.\r\nMurphy had his headquarters in Albany directing the contest; he was\r\nsaid to have given his promise to Mr. Sheehan, but when he saw that\r\nSheehan could not be elected, he tried to bring about the election of\r\nDaniel F. Cohalan, his personal attorney and adviser, as United States\r\nSenator. A few years previously, Cohalan was an obscure lawyer, but\r\nas the friend and adviser of “Boss” Murphy, his practise had grown to\r\nlarge and lucrative proportions; it was a practise principally dealing\r\nwith matters concerning municipal affairs. In 1908 Mr. Murphy had\r\ncaused Mr. Cohalan to be chosen Grand Sachem of the Tammany Society.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Murphy found that it was not possible to put Cohalan in the\r\nUnited States Senate. Certain “insurgent” Democratic legislators\r\nelected from various parts of the State, wanted neither Sheehan, Ryan’s\r\nattorney, nor Cohalan, Murphy’s attorney. Finally Justice James A.\r\nO’Gorman (who years previously had been elected to the New York State\r\nSupreme Court by Tammany) was compromised upon as the candidate for\r\nUnited States Senator and elected.\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Murphy decided to make Mr. Cohalan Justice O’Gorman’s\r\nsuccessor on the Supreme Court Bench.\r\n\r\nAccording to published report, the appointment of Mr. Cohalan as a\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court by Governor Dix was the result of “a deal”\r\nbetween Dix and Murphy. Governor Dix wanted the appointment of George\r\nC. Van Tuyl, as State Commissioner of Banks, confirmed. The nomination\r\nof Van Tuyl was referred to the Senate Finance Committee, of which\r\nSenator Frawley, a Tammany district leader, was chairman. A report was\r\nprepared recommending that the nomination of Van Tuyl be confirmed,\r\nbut this report was held up week after week, and the statement was\r\ncommon in the political slang current at Albany that no action could be\r\ntaken in presenting the report “until the Governor comes across with\r\nCohalan.” At last, on May 18, 1911, Senator Frawley suddenly presented\r\nthe report, moved its confirmation, and the Senate acquiesced. Sixteen\r\nminutes later a message appeared from Governor Dix announcing the\r\nappointment of Daniel F. Cohalan to succeed James A. O’Gorman as\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court for the remainder of O’Gorman’s unexpired\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nThe session of 1911 was the first time in nineteen years that the\r\nDemocratic party had control of the Legislature, and Tammany Hall was\r\nin control of the Democratic organization in the State. It was at this\r\nsession that a strong effort was made to enact the Tammany-Gaynor\r\n“Ripper” Charter, the provisions of which aroused much scandal. The\r\nmajority of the Board of Estimate in New York City were at this time\r\nIndependent Democrats. The proposed charter would have arbitrarily\r\ndeprived them of many of their most important functions of office.\r\nIts aim was to impair the powers of the Board of Estimate in many\r\ndestructive ways, and to centralize power in the hands of the Mayor. It\r\nwould have given the Mayor complete domination of the development of\r\ntransportation facilities in New York City. Such effective opposition\r\nwas raised that it was defeated by the votes of Independent Democrats\r\nin the Assembly. At this session it was, too, that an attempt was made\r\nto pass the Sullivan Inferior Criminal Courts “Ripper” bill which, by\r\nmaking city magistrates elective instead of appointive, would have\r\nrestored the old pernicious, demoralizing system of local political\r\ninfluence. These were but two of a list of other proposed Tammany\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nMr. Murphy’s habits as leader at this time were in singular contrast\r\nwith those of years previously when, as a district leader, he had\r\nmade his hailing place by a lamp post. He now used a luxurious suite\r\nof rooms at Delmonico’s fashionable restaurant, at Fifth avenue and\r\nForty-fourth street, where, during campaign contests, he held his\r\nsecret consultations. Here those whom the “Boss” desired to see on\r\nterms of great privacy were summoned, nor were they admitted, it was\r\nreported, before they had been first scrutinized and received by Mr.\r\nMurphy’s factotum, “Phil” Donohue, the treasurer of Tammany Hall,\r\nwho took his stand in an anteroom. During the campaign of 1911, when\r\nCounty and Assembly candidates were to be elected, Mr. Murphy was to be\r\nfound almost daily at Delmonico’s, and, according to published report,\r\nJustice Cohalan was there with him frequently. It was at this election\r\nthat Mr. Cohalan was elected Justice of the Supreme Court for a period\r\nof fourteen years.\r\n\r\nVeteran politicians who had learned the wisdom of combining the\r\npocketing of millions with the art of simple appearances, shook their\r\nheads ominously at what they considered “Boss” Murphy’s tactlessness in\r\nvaunting his power, surrounded by ostentation and grandiose luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] An indication of Senator Grady’s large sources of income had come\r\nto public notice in 1907 when the District Attorney’s force raided the\r\npoolroom “clearing house” at 112 Fulton street, New York City. Canceled\r\nchecks and other records found there revealed that a mysterious person\r\ndesignated variously in the syndicate’s account books as “Tommy,” “T.\r\nG.,” “T. Grady,” and “Sen.,” had “raked off” more than $43,000 on the\r\npoolroom business in the first two years of the syndicate’s existence\r\nand had continued to profit from that source up to the very time of the\r\nraid. No doubt, however, Grady had his losses, too.\r\n\r\n[2] Hyde, on November 29, 1912, was convicted in court on a charge of\r\naccepting a bribe, as a public officer, in consideration for depositing\r\npublic money in certain banks. He was sentenced to two years in State’s\r\nprison. But the verdict was later reversed by the Appellate Division of\r\nthe Supreme Court, and he was released from all criminal charges.\r\n\r\n[3] The Committee commented: “The investigation shows clearly the\r\nextreme difficulty of securing exact information which will disclose\r\nthe methods by which powerful financial interests seek to control\r\nlegislative action in matters coming before legislative bodies.\r\n\r\n“The crime of bribery is one of the most difficult of all crimes to\r\nuncover. All the resources of ingenuity are used to conceal it, and\r\nonly in exceedingly rare instances are either of the parties to the\r\ncrime willing to come forward and disclose the facts.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n“CHIEF” MURPHY’S LEADERSHIP--FURTHER DETAILS\r\n\r\n1912-1913\r\n\r\n\r\nMayor Gaynor was by no means pliable to Tammany purposes; he both\r\nasserted and exercised his independence of “Chief” Murphy. But although\r\ngreat powers were centralized in his office, there were nevertheless\r\nnumbers of Tammany men in the various departments, bureaus and courts.\r\nOf the 85,000 regular employees of New York City in 1912 (including\r\n10,118 policemen and 4,346 firemen), many were Tammany men, the larger\r\nnumber of them occupying subordinate positions. The entire city payroll\r\nat this time aggregated about $89,000,000--an average outlay of\r\n$7,500,000 a month for salaries and wages alone. The city budget for\r\n1913 was $190,411,000.\r\n\r\nDespite the appointment of successive Police Commissioners--there\r\nhad been eight within eleven years--to remedy matters in the Police\r\nDepartment, the state of affairs in that department was still a\r\nfruitful cause of scandal. This continuing scandal was brought to a\r\nvivid climax by a murder the deliberate audacity of which horrified and\r\naroused the people of the city.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 1912, Police Lieutenant Charles Becker went, at the head\r\nof his “raiding squad,” to the gambling house of Herman Rosenthal on\r\nWest Forty-fifth street. On July 11, 1912, Rosenthal went to the West\r\nSide Police Court to protest against the “oppression” of the police in\r\nstationing a uniformed man constantly on duty in his house. Shortly\r\nthereafter, Rosenthal made an affidavit, which was published in the\r\nNew York _World_ on July 14, 1912, swearing that Police Lieutenant\r\nBecker had been his partner in the operation of the gambling house and\r\nhad made the raid for certain personal purposes hereafter explained.\r\n\r\nIf at this time a Tammany district attorney had been in office, the\r\nresults might not have been fatal to Rosenthal. But the district\r\nattorney, Charles S. Whitman, was an official noted for his excellent\r\nrecord. It was well realized that when he agreed to listen to\r\nRosenthal’s charges against Becker, he could not be “reached” by any\r\n“influence” or intimidated by any threat. The alternative on the part\r\nof somebody vitally interested was to slay Rosenthal on the principle\r\nthat “dead men tell no tales,” and thus prevent important disclosures\r\nbeing made to the district attorney.\r\n\r\nAt 2 o’clock on the morning of July 16, 1912, Rosenthal was summoned\r\nout from the doorway of the Hotel Metropole at Broadway and Forty-third\r\nstreet, and shot to death by four “gunmen” from within an automobile,\r\nwhich immediately after the shooting sped away with the murderers.\r\n\r\nArrests of suspects quickly followed. By July 29, 1912, District\r\nAttorney Whitman held four men, all of whom had become informers. These\r\nfour were “Bald Jack” Rose, “Bridgie” Webber, Harry Vallon, and Sam\r\nSchepps--two of whom, Rose and Vallon, had voluntarily surrendered.\r\nOn statements made by Rose and Vallon, the Grand Jury returned an\r\nindictment against Becker charging murder in the first degree. A few\r\ndays later, Becker was re-indicted, and indictments were handed in\r\nagainst the four “gunmen”--Louis Rosenberg, alias “Lefty Louie,” 23\r\nyears old; Harry Horowitz, alias “Gyp the Blood,” 26 years old; Jacob\r\nSeidenshner, alias “Whitey Lewis,” 26 years old, and Frank Cirofici,\r\nalias “Dago Frank,” 29 years old. These “gunmen” were variously\r\narrested at different places.\r\n\r\nStirred by this brutal murder, a mass meeting of citizens was held at\r\nCooper Union on August 14, 1912. Resolutions were adopted part of which\r\napproved a proposal for an appropriation by the city of $25,000 for\r\nan investigation into police conditions and a thorough inquiry into\r\nthe causes and possible remedies of systems of blackmail and graft. A\r\nCitizens’ Committee was appointed by this mass meeting to report on\r\nthese conditions.\r\n\r\nOf the police force this committee reported on February 26, 1913, that:\r\n\r\n    “The corruption is so ingrained that the man of ordinary decent\r\n    character entering the force and not possessed of extraordinary\r\n    moral fiber may easily succumb. About him are the evidences\r\n    of graft and the enjoyment of irregular incomes substantially\r\n    increasing the patrolman’s salary. Inadequate condemnation is\r\n    shown by his associates in the force for such practises; on the\r\n    contrary, there is much indirect pressure which induces him to\r\n    break his oath of office; the families of grafting policemen\r\n    live better than his own, and the urgencies of his family and\r\n    of his own social needs tempt him to thrive as do his corrupt\r\n    associates. Such a system makes for too many of the police an\r\n    organized school of crime. The improvement of recent years--and\r\n    there is some--is not great enough to satisfy an aroused public.\r\n\r\n    “But not resting with this general knowledge of the existence\r\n    of such matters, this Committee has made an intensive\r\n    examination of the conditions in a number of police precincts.\r\n    We know that the connection between members of the police force\r\n    and crime or commercialized vice is continuous, profitable\r\n    and so much a matter of course that explicit bargains do not\r\n    have to be made; naturally this “honor among thieves” is\r\n    occasionally violated, as is customary among thieves, both the\r\n    keeping and the breaking of faith being determined by these\r\n    policemen for their own profit.\r\n\r\n    “Well knowing this police ‘system,’ grand juries will not on\r\n    police testimony indict violators of the law, lest they [the\r\n    grand juries] be lending themselves to police persecution of a\r\n    selected criminal who had refused tribute, and so be helping\r\n    the police ‘system.’ For the same reason petit juries will\r\n    acquit, and judges will discharge, and crime increases and\r\n    goes unpunished, while honest policemen are discredited and\r\n    discouraged.\r\n\r\n    “Evil thus breeds new maggots of evil. The sums collected\r\n    by the police excite the greed of certain politicians; they\r\n    demand their shares, and in their turn they protect the\r\n    criminal breaches of the law and the police in corruption.\r\n    The presence of ‘politics’ brings strength and complexity to\r\n    the ‘system’ and makes it harder to break up. The city, we\r\n    believe, is convinced that it is time for more radical efforts\r\n    at improvement.”[1]\r\n\r\nA Committee of the Board of Aldermen, appointed to inquire into\r\nmatters connected with the Police Department, held eighty public\r\nsessions, took 4,800 pages of testimony and records, handed in certain\r\nconclusions, and made recommendations for further laws. “We have\r\nreceived shocking evidence of a widespread corrupt alliance between\r\nthe police and gamblers and disorderly house keepers,” this committee\r\nreported in part.[2] During the same time, District Attorney Whitman\r\nwas vigorously prosecuting public offenders. In a single year four\r\npolice inspectors were convicted of conspiracy and were also under\r\nindictment for bribery, one police captain was convicted of extortion,\r\none lieutenant was convicted of extortion, one patrolman of perjury,\r\nand two patrolmen were convicted of extortion. In addition, there were\r\nvarious indictments of patrolmen for extortion. Of the convicted, the\r\ncaptain and one patrolman confessed; an attorney and a citizen indicted\r\nfor bribery in connection with police matters, also confessed.\r\n\r\nTo return to the trials for the murder of Rosenthal: At Becker’s trial\r\nRose testified that his connection with Becker had begun in 1911, after\r\na “raid” on a gambling house kept by him (Rose) on Second Avenue; that\r\nthe levying of tribute on “unraided” gamblers was systematized; that\r\nRosenthal was brought under this system of “protection”; that Rosenthal\r\nand Becker had become partners; and that Rosenthal in March, 1912,\r\nhad refused to “give up” $500 for the defense of Becker’s press agent\r\nwho was charged with the killing of a negro in a “raid” on a crap\r\ngame. According further to Rose’s testimony, this refusal brought on\r\nstrained relations between Becker and Rosenthal; and that after the\r\n“raid” on Rosenthal’s gambling house, on April 15, 1912, when Rosenthal\r\nthreatened “to squeal,” Becker began to plan for the “fixing” of\r\nRosenthal. In June, 1912--so Rose testified--when “Big Jack” Zelig, an\r\nEast Side gang leader, was in the City Prison, the plan was determined\r\nupon of negotiating with him that, in exchange for his release, some of\r\nhis “gunmen” should “attend to” Rosenthal. The four “gunmen” arrested,\r\nRose swore, were the tools that committed the murder, and he (Rose) had\r\nacted as Becker’s agent in arranging matters with them. The testimony\r\nfurther showed that on the afternoon after the murder, the quartet of\r\n“gunmen” had received $1,000 as payment, after which they quit the city.\r\n\r\nOn the testimony of Rose and others, Becker was convicted on October\r\n24, 1913; the conviction of the four young “gunmen” soon followed. All\r\nfive were sentenced to death. By a decision of the Court of Appeals,\r\non February 24, 1914, Becker was allowed a new trial upon the ground\r\nthat by reason of hostile rulings his trial had not been fair, but the\r\nconviction of the four “gunmen” was affirmed. They were electrocuted at\r\nSing Sing prison on April 13, 1914. Subsequently, after a second trial,\r\nBecker was again convicted, and was duly electrocuted.\r\n\r\nAnother source of quick-ripening trouble to Tammany Hall, turning\r\nlarge numbers of voters against its chief, Mr. Murphy, and against the\r\nwhole system of the “Organization,” was the summary manner in which it\r\nimpeached and disposed of Governor William Sulzer.\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer had been a member of Tammany Hall for twenty-five years,\r\nand had always been pushed into office by Tammany Hall since the time\r\nwhen, as a young man, he had been one of Mr. Croker’s protégés. Elected\r\nto the New York State Assembly, he had been made its Speaker at a\r\nyouthful age. Later he had been repeatedly sent to Congress by Tammany\r\nHall nominations, and it was primarily a Tammany backing that caused\r\nhis nomination and election as Governor, in 1912. Tammany believed\r\nthat it had every reason to feel sure that as Governor Mr. Sulzer\r\nwould continue pliable and docile to the “Organization’s” orders and\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n“Boss” Murphy, however, was soon disillusioned when Governor Sulzer\r\ndeclined dictation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Sulzer’s detailed story,[3] he (Sulzer), immediately\r\nprior to going into office as Governor, spent an afternoon with Mr.\r\nMurphy at his request in his private room at Delmonico’s.\r\n\r\n“His attitude,” Mr. Sulzer related, “was very friendly and\r\nconfidential. He said he was my friend; that he knew of my financial\r\ncondition and wanted to help me out. As he went on, I was amazed at\r\nhis knowledge of my intimate personal affairs. To my astonishment, he\r\ninformed me that he knew I was heavily in debt. Then he offered me\r\nenough money to pay my debts and have enough left to take things easy\r\nwhile Governor. He said that this was really a party matter and that\r\nthe money he would give me was party money … and that nobody would\r\nknow anything about it; that I could pay what I owed and go to Albany\r\nfeeling easy financially. He then asked me how much I needed, to whom I\r\nowed it, and other personal questions.\r\n\r\n“As I did not want to be tied hard and fast as Governor in advance,\r\nI declined Mr. Murphy’s offer, saying that I was paying off my debts\r\ngradually; that my creditors were friends and would not press me;\r\nthat I was economical, that I would try to get along on my salary as\r\nGovernor.” Mr. Sulzer asserted that Mr. Murphy repeated the offer, and\r\nthat when he (Sulzer) again refused, Mr. Murphy said, “If you need\r\nmoney at any time, let me know, and you can have what you want. We\r\ncleaned up a lot of money on your campaign. I can afford to let you\r\nhave what you want and never miss it.”\r\n\r\nThen, according further to Mr. Sulzer’s story, Mr. Murphy wanted\r\nGovernor Sulzer to meet him at the hotel in Albany where Murphy was\r\nstaying; Sulzer did not go. Subsequently, on the night of February 2,\r\n1913, they met at Justice Edward E. McCall’s house in New York City,\r\nwhere Murphy urged the appointment of his friend, John Galvin, to\r\nsucceed Mr. Willcox as a member of the Public Service Commission in\r\nNew York City. The Public Service Commission is a body invested with\r\nenormous authority in the matter of granting of public franchises and\r\nother comprehensive powers; it had been under anti-Tammany control, and\r\nit was a body the domination of which was pressingly sought by Tammany;\r\nthere were vast subway franchises to be awarded, and the powers of that\r\nbody could be used with almost autocratic effect in certain ways over\r\nthe entire range of recognized public service corporations. Governor\r\nSulzer would not appoint Galvin, but finally compromised upon the\r\nselection of Justice Edward E. McCall as Chairman of the Public Service\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n“At this meeting and subsequently,” Mr. Sulzer declared, “Mr. Murphy\r\ndemanded from me pledges regarding legislation and especially\r\nconcerning appointments to the Public Service Commission, the Health\r\nDepartment, the Labor Department, the State Hospital Commission, the\r\nDepartment of State Prisons and the Department of Highways.” Murphy\r\ninsisted that various Tammany men whom he named should be appointed to\r\nthose offices. Mr. Murphy, however, favored the retention in office of\r\nC. Gordon Reel, State Superintendent of Highways, saying that he was “a\r\ngood man.” “Mr. Murphy added,” Mr. Sulzer’s statement continued, “that\r\nif I wished a new State Superintendent of Highways, ‘Jim’ Gaffney was\r\nthe best all-around man for the job.”\r\n\r\n“When I took office as Governor of the State last January,” Mr. Sulzer\r\ndeclared in a signed published statement,\r\n\r\n    “on the very first day my attention was abruptly called to the\r\n    fact that during the year just ended there had been spent in\r\n    the State $34,000,000 WITHOUT A SINGLE AUDIT.\r\n\r\n    “On the second day that I was in office a messenger presented\r\n    to me bills amounting to hundreds of thousands of dollars,\r\n    pointing out to me where I was to sign my name. If I had\r\n    attached my signature to those bills they would have been\r\n    immediately paid, and yet the messenger thought that he was\r\n    telling me nothing unusual when he said that other Governors\r\n    had signed bills that way, and that one Governor had left a\r\n    rubber stamp outside his office with the messenger, so that he\r\n    would not be bothered.\r\n\r\n    “‘Leave those bills there,’ I said, ‘and I’ll look into them.\r\n    The rubber stamp period is over.’”\r\n\r\nAfter Mr. Sulzer had become Governor he learned, as his statement read,\r\nthat the State Architect had expended more than $4,300,000 in the\r\nprevious year; that this was done practically on the certificate of\r\nthat official, and that there had been no proper audit; the vouchers\r\nhad been carried to the trustees of public buildings, composed of\r\nthe Governor, Lieutenant-Governor and Speaker of the Assembly by a\r\nclerk and approved by the use of a regular office stamp. Governor\r\nSulzer also learned, he said, that the appropriation for 1912 had been\r\nexceeded by nearly half a million dollars, and that there was no proper\r\nsupervision. Governor Sulzer appointed John A. Hennessy as Commissioner\r\nto investigate reports of graft in these and other departments. At the\r\nsame time, he appointed George W. Blake as Commissioner to inquire into\r\nprison management.\r\n\r\nMr. Hennessy’s report disclosed the most widespread graft. In\r\nconstruction work on public buildings, large bills had been submitted\r\nfor inferior material; the payrolls on the electrical and other\r\ncontracts had been padded; regular State employees had been displaced\r\nas inspectors and timekeepers by political henchmen from Tammany\r\nDistrict Leader James J. Hagan’s district in Manhattan, from which\r\nthe State Architect, his secretary, and the foreman on the general\r\nwork came. At Governor Sulzer’s request, Mr. Hennessy asked the State\r\nArchitect for his resignation, but Senator Frawley, another Tammany\r\ndistrict leader, intervened with a protest to Governor Sulzer against\r\nany interference with the work on the State Capitol or other State\r\nbuildings.\r\n\r\n“I sent for Hennessy,” Mr. Sulzer’s narrative went on, “who in my\r\npresence related to Senator Frawley the main facts in the case, but\r\nFrawley still persisted that nothing should be done with the State\r\nArchitect’s office, at least until there had been further consideration\r\nof the case. I told Hennessy to return to the State Architect (Mr.\r\nHoofer) and insist upon his resignation. What happened between these\r\ntwo men I can only tell from Hennessy’s recital to me. Hoofer told him\r\nthat he (Hoofer) was not a free agent, that he had no control over his\r\ndeputies, that he had no control over his secretary, nor did he have\r\nany control over the men who checked up the work. He (Hoofer) said they\r\nwere all appointed through Tammany Hall.… Hoofer said he wanted to\r\nconsult somebody in New York. While I held the ’phone, I told Hennessy\r\nto ask Hoofer the name of the man, and Hennessy responded that Hoofer\r\nwanted an opportunity to see Charles F. Murphy and explain certain\r\nthings.”\r\n\r\nGovernor Sulzer allowed a few days’ delay. Shortly before the time\r\nlimit that Governor Sulzer had set for Hoofer’s resignation, “John H.\r\nDelaney came to me,” Mr. Sulzer’s story went on, “and said that he had\r\nbeen talking to ‘the Chief’ over the ’phone, and that Murphy wanted\r\nHoofer’s resignation to go over until such time as he could discuss the\r\ncase with me.” A little later “Senator Wagner, Senator Frawley and John\r\nH. Delaney came into the Executive Chamber and informed me that Murphy\r\nwas insistent that nothing should be done in the case of Hoofer during\r\nthat week, and it was a subject that would have to be discussed with\r\nthe organization.” Upon Governor Sulzer’s demand that he resign or be\r\nimmediately removed, Mr. Hoofer wrote his resignation.\r\n\r\nThe next official removed by Governor Sulzer was C. Gordon Reel,\r\nState Superintendent of Highways, following Commissioner Hennessy’s\r\ninvestigation and the disclosures of extensive graft in highway\r\ncontracts in a large number of counties. The amount of this graft\r\nhas been variously estimated at from $5,000,000 to $9,000,000. That\r\nthe system of plundering the State in the building of roads was no\r\nfiction was shown later in the large number of indictments (followed by\r\nmany convictions) handed down against politico-contractors and State\r\nemployes in New York State.\r\n\r\nIn the most important of the indictments found by the Suffolk County\r\nGrand Jury on January 22, 1914, the Grand Jury charged “grand larceny”\r\nand “conspiracy” in the construction of a so-called “cementitious\r\nHudson River gravel road” the specifications of which designated a\r\nmaterial absolutely controlled by Henry Steers, of the contracting firm\r\nof Bradley, Gaffney & Steers, commonly known as “the Tammany Trust.”\r\n\r\nDuring an investigation conducted by James W. Osborne, in behalf of New\r\nYork State, the testimony, on February 17, 1914, indicated that State\r\nSuperintendent of Highways Reel ordered the use of a patented road for\r\nroadways and caused the specifications to be changed so as to favor\r\nthe Gaffney-Bradley-Steers Company which controlled this particular\r\npatented pavement. And when Mr. Sulzer testified, on February 29, 1914,\r\nbefore the Assembly “Graft Hunt” Investigating Committee, he said that\r\nan average of 30 per cent. of the money paid for those State roads\r\n(which had been investigated by Mr. Hennessy) went into the contract,\r\nand that 70 per cent. went into the pockets of politicians and\r\ncontractors. Mr. Sulzer asserted that about $9,000,000 had been stolen\r\nin 1912.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Sulzer, Mr. Reel’s appointment as State Commissioner\r\nof Highways had been Mr. Murphy’s “personal selection.” When Governor\r\nSulzer’s attitude indicated Reel’s removal, Mr. Murphy (so Sulzer\r\nstated) pressed forward the appointment of “Jim” Gaffney to succeed\r\nReel. “Mr. Murphy demanded the appointment of Gaffney, and still later\r\na prominent New Yorker came to me in the Executive Mansion bringing the\r\nmessage from Mr. Murphy that it was ‘Gaffney or war.’ I declined to\r\nappoint Gaffney.\r\n\r\n“This is the Gaffney who, only a few months afterwards, on September 4,\r\n1913, in undisputed testimony before the Supreme Court of New York, was\r\nshown to have demanded and received $30,000 in money (refusing to take\r\na check) from one of the aqueduct contractors, nominally for ‘advice.’\r\nThis is the man who Mr. Murphy demanded should be put in a position\r\nwhere he would superintend and control the spending of sixty-five\r\nmillions of the money of the State in road contracts.”\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer here referred to the testimony of Harry B. Hanger, aqueduct\r\ncontractor, who swore that he paid Mr. Gaffney $30,000 for “expert\r\nadvice on the labor situation” on one contract, and $10,000 for the\r\nsame services on another contract. Mr. Gaffney later--on March 20,\r\n1914--himself testified before the Special Grand Jury in New York City\r\nas to this transaction.\r\n\r\nIt was the same Mr. Gaffney, too, whose name was involved in the award\r\nof Contract No. 22 for the Catskill Aqueduct. This contract was awarded\r\non March 19, 1909, over two lower bidders to Patterson & Company, a\r\nfirm of no great capital or experience. James W. Patterson, Jr., head\r\nof that firm, subsequently testified before the Grand Jury, in 1914,\r\nto his making arrangements to pay 5 per cent. of the contract price\r\n($824,942.50) as a “contribution to Tammany Hall.” John M. Murphy, a\r\nBronx contractor, testified that, as agent for James E. Gaffney, he had\r\narranged to sell the contract, and had received from Mr. Gaffney 10 per\r\ncent., or $4,125, as his share of a certain $41,250, after threatening\r\n“to kick over the whole deal” if Gaffney did not give the proper\r\n“honorarium.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared from the testimony that $41,250 in bills had been deposited\r\nin escrow to be handed over by James G. Shaw, the “stakeholder,” to a\r\nsome one designated as Gaffney, on the day after the award of Aqueduct\r\nContract No. 22. Questioned as to whom this $41,250 was given, Mr. Shaw\r\ncould not remember, which forgetfulness made the fastening of legal\r\nproof impossible. The special Grand Jury investigating this matter\r\nreported, however, in a presentment to Justice Vernon M. Davis, in\r\nthe Supreme Court, New York City, on April 21, 1914, that the Grand\r\nJurors were morally satisfied that a crime had been committed in the\r\nsale of Contract No. 22 to Patterson & Company, and that this contract\r\ncould not have been sold and delivered, as it was, in the name of\r\nJames E. Gaffney, “without the collusion of a member of the Board (of\r\nWater Supply) itself.” Inasmuch as five years had passed since the\r\ntransaction, the Statute of Limitations intervened to bar criminal\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nIn an inquiry later conducted by District Attorney Whitman, James C.\r\nStewart swore that one “Gaffney” asked him for a contribution of five\r\nper cent. upon $3,000,000 worth of canal work that he (Stewart) was\r\nseeking. Stewart refused to make the arrangement; his bid was much the\r\nlowest, but he did not then get the contract. Precisely what “Gaffney”\r\nit was who proposed the handing over of this $150,000, Stewart averred\r\nthat he could not tell; he had never seen him previously. When, on\r\nJanuary 30, 1914, District Attorney Whitman brought Stewart and James\r\nE. Gaffney face to face, Stewart said that he could not identify Mr.\r\nGaffney as the man who demanded the $150,000.\r\n\r\nDuring the course of this same inquiry Mr. Sulzer testified, on January\r\n21, 1914, that on learning that Stewart was to be denied the contracts,\r\nhe telegraphed on December 18, 1912, to the Canal Board asking it to\r\ndefer action until he could consult with its members. Whereupon John\r\nH. Delaney came to him and excitedly said, “My God, Congressman, what\r\nhave you done? It angered the Chief more than anything else I have ever\r\nknown. The Chief is wild.” The “Chief,” otherwise Charles F. Murphy,\r\ndemanded an interview with the Governor-elect at once.\r\n\r\nIn this interview, which was held at Delmonico’s, Mr. Sulzer quoted Mr.\r\nMurphy as saying to him, “Why did you send that telegram to the Canal\r\nBoard? You have no right to butt in on things that don’t concern you.\r\nI’m attending to that matter, and I want you to keep your hands off.\r\nIf you are going to begin this way, I can see now where you will end\r\nas Governor. You do what you are told hereafter, and don’t take any\r\naction on matters that don’t concern you without conferring with me.”\r\nWhen Mr. Sulzer said he was going to be Governor, Mr. Murphy (so Sulzer\r\ntestified) replied: “So that is the way you understand it? Well, if you\r\ngo along that line, I can see where you will end up damned quick. You\r\nare going to be Governor? Like hell you are!”\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer further testified at this hearing that on the evening of\r\nMarch 3, 1913, at a luncheon in Washington, he told Senator O’Gorman\r\nthat Mr. Murphy was putting the “screws” on him and bringing to\r\nbear all the influence he could to have James E. Gaffney appointed\r\nCommissioner of Highways, and that Senator O’Gorman had said:\r\n“Governor, if you appoint Jim Gaffney Commissioner of Highways it will\r\nbe a disgrace to the State of New York and it will ruin your political\r\ncareer as the Governor. Don’t you know that Gaffney is Murphy’s chief\r\nbagman? Don’t you know he is the man Murphy sends out to hold up the\r\ncontractors? Don’t you know he is the man that held up my client, James\r\nG. Stewart, for over a hundred thousand dollars, and he would have got\r\naway with it if Stewart had not come to me, and if I had not gone to\r\nMurphy and read the Riot Act, telling him that I would not stand for\r\nthat kind of politics; that he had to stop Gaffney, and that if he\r\ndidn’t stop Gaffney, so far as my client was concerned, I would expose\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\nSubsequently Mr. Sulzer met Mr. Murphy several times, and was\r\nimportuned (so he testified) to appoint Mr. Gaffney. When Sulzer\r\nreplied that it was impossible, Mr. Murphy announced, “Well, it’s\r\nGaffney or war.” Mr. Sulzer’s testimony went on: “At this conversation,\r\none of the things Mr. Murphy said to me was, ‘If you don’t do this,\r\nI will wreck your administration.’ It was not the first time he had\r\nthreatened me, and I answered, ‘I am the Governor, and I am going to\r\nbe the Governor.’ He said, ‘You may be the Governor, but I have got\r\nthe Legislature, and the Legislature controls the Governor, and if\r\nyou don’t do what I tell you to do, I will throw you out of office.’”\r\nAfter Governor Sulzer had removed Reel, Mr. Murphy was still pressing\r\nGaffney’s appointment.\r\n\r\nOf the inquiries into graft carried on by George W. Blake and John\r\nW. Hennessy, Mr. Sulzer testified: “Their reports staggered me, and\r\nbelieve me, it takes something to stagger me. There was graft, graft\r\neverywhere, nor any man to stop it.” Mr. Sulzer testified that Mr.\r\nMurphy had sought to hamper the graft exposure by causing to be cut\r\noff--for the first time in the State’s history, he said--the Governor’s\r\ncontingent fund, and he described how it became necessary to raise\r\nmoney by private subscription to enable the graft inquiry to be carried\r\non.\r\n\r\n“I have been in office now for six months,” wrote Mr. Sulzer in a\r\nsigned article later, “and in that time I have learned enough to be\r\nable to say without fear of contradiction that in the past three years\r\n$50,000,000 of the people’s money has been wasted or stolen.”\r\n\r\nIn a talk, on March 18, 1913, with Mr. Murphy over appointments to\r\nthe Supreme Court of New York State, the Tammany chief--so Mr. Sulzer\r\nrelated--“threatened me with public disgrace unless I agreed to his\r\nprogram on legislative matters and appointments. It was at this\r\nconference, too, that he talked about the things he ‘had on me,’ and\r\nsaid that I had better listen to him and not to his enemies up the\r\nState; that if I did what he told me I would have things easy and no\r\ntrouble, and that if I didn’t do what he wanted me to, I would have all\r\nthe trouble I wanted.…\r\n\r\n“He was very insulting. Then I asked him what he could do to destroy\r\nme. And he said: ‘Never mind; you will find out in good time. Stand\r\nby the organization and you will be all right. If you go against the\r\norganization, I will make your administration the laughing stock of the\r\nState.’ It was at this time that he asked me to call off George Blake,\r\nthe commissioner who was investigating the prisons.… I told him that\r\nBlake was an efficient man and that I was going to let him go on with\r\nhis work, and he said, ‘If you do you will be sorry for it. Mark what I\r\nam telling you now!’\r\n\r\n“I told him what I had heard about the vileness of things in the Sing\r\nSing and Auburn prisons. I said: ‘We certainly ought not to stand for\r\nthem. I want to get at the facts, and if there is anything wrong, stop\r\nit; if there is any graft, eliminate it.’ Mr. Murphy told me that he\r\ndidn’t want anything done in connection with Sing Sing prison by Blake\r\nor any other man; that the warden there, Mr. Kennedy, was a friend of\r\nhis and a good man, and he wanted him left alone. This, remember, was\r\nthe warden whom I afterward removed from his place on charges and who\r\nwas since indicted by the Westchester grand jury.” It may be noted here\r\nthat later there were a number of prosecutions in prison graft cases.\r\nThe graft in the prisons reached a total of many millions of dollars in\r\nthe one item alone of the substitution of bad food for the good food\r\npaid for by the State. Extensive grafting was found in other respects.\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer added that one of the agents through whom Mr. Murphy most\r\nfrequently communicated with him was Justice Edward E. McCall. “Judge\r\nMcCall usually spoke of Mr. Murphy as ‘the Chief,’ and would say to me\r\nthat ‘the Chief’ wished such and such a thing done, or demanded that I\r\nfollow such and such a course of action. Every Tammany member of either\r\nhouse who approached me from day to day used the same language, saying\r\nthat ‘the Chief’ demanded this or demanded that, or that ‘the Chief’\r\nhad telephoned to put through such a piece of legislation, or kill some\r\nother piece of legislation.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, on March 10, 1913, reports of trouble between Governor\r\nSulzer and Mr. Murphy had become public; when on this date Sulzer\r\nremoved C. Gordon Reel as State Superintendent of Highways, it was\r\nreported in the newspapers that Murphy had asked Governor Sulzer to\r\nname James E. Gaffney, his partner in the contracting business, as\r\nReel’s successor. On the next day, Mr. Murphy hotly denied that he\r\nhad asked Gaffney’s appointment. From day to day further reports of\r\nestrangement were published. In a speech before the Democratic editors\r\nof the State, on March 25, Sulzer asserted: “No man, no party, no\r\norganization can make me a rubber stamp. I am the Governor. Let no man\r\ndoubt that.”\r\n\r\nIt appeared that Mr. Murphy had the idea that Sulzer was at heart a\r\nProgressive; it may be explained that the Progressive party had polled\r\na large vote and was recognized as a powerful political factor.\r\n\r\nIt was on the night of April 13, 1913, that Governor Sulzer, according\r\nto his interview published later in the New York _Evening Mail_, held\r\nhis final interview with Mr. Murphy. “I asked him,” Mr. Sulzer said,\r\n“not to interfere with the trial of Stilwell in the Senate. I said,\r\n‘What are you going to do about him?’ ‘Stand by him, of course,’\r\nreplied Mr. Murphy. ‘Stilwell will be acquitted. It will only be a\r\nthree-day wonder. How do you expect a Senator to live on $1,500 a year?\r\nThat is only chicken feed.’ … Before we parted that night, I warned Mr.\r\nMurphy that he would wreck the party and accomplish his own destruction\r\nif he persisted in shielding grafters and violating platform pledges.\r\nHis angry retort was that I was an ingrate, and that he would disgrace\r\nand destroy me.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, as Mr. Murphy predicted, Senator Stephen J. Stilwell was\r\nvoted not guilty of official misconduct, by a vote of 28 to 21 in the\r\nSenate, after an investigation by the judiciary committee of charges\r\nof bribery made against him by George H. Kendall, president of the New\r\nYork Bank Note Company. But subsequently Stilwell was indicted in New\r\nYork County, convicted of bribery upon substantially the same evidence\r\nas that upon which a majority of his colleagues in the State Senate had\r\nacquitted him, and he was sentenced to a two-year term in prison.\r\n\r\nReplying later to Mr. Sulzer’s charges, Mr. Murphy definitely denied\r\nthat he had ever recommended the appointment of James E. Gaffney\r\nas Highways Commissioner; that he ever mentioned Gaffney’s name to\r\nGovernor Sulzer for any office; he emphatically denied that he ever\r\nmade the threats that Sulzer attributed to him or that he ever sent for\r\nMr. Sulzer to come and see him. Mr. Murphy asserted that he never saw\r\nSulzer alone after he became Governor “because I knew he’d do just what\r\nhe has done--perjure himself.”\r\n\r\nIn April, 1913, Governor Sulzer pushed his Direct Primary Bill, and\r\nTammany members of the Legislature decided in retaliation to defeat\r\nall bills favored by him and to “hold up” all of his appointments. On\r\nApril 24, 1913, Tammany legislators were stirred to anger by his veto\r\nof a direct primary bill that they had concocted; a few days later they\r\noverwhelmingly voted down his direct primary bill. More retaliation\r\nfollowed on both sides.\r\n\r\nIt was during this time--in May, 1913--that the New York _World_\r\npublished specific charges that in return for a promise made two years\r\npreviously to get a lucrative post for J. A. Connolly, a personal\r\nfriend, Justice Cohalan, Murphy’s legal and political adviser, had\r\ntaken a note from Connolly for $4,000. This promise, it was charged,\r\nhad not been kept. There were, it was also charged, back of this note a\r\nseries of transactions in the years 1904 to 1906 between Connolly and\r\nCohalan involving the payment of various sums amounting to $3,940.55;\r\nConnolly claimed that Cohalan had demanded and obtained from him 55 per\r\ncent. of the net profits on all city work that was given to Connolly’s\r\nfirm by means of Cohalan’s influence. Connolly further claimed that\r\nthe payments to Cohalan were calculated on this basis, and that their\r\nfriendship ceased when Cohalan demanded $1,500 more than Connolly\r\nreckoned was due him. Threatened with an action at law, Cohalan\r\nsurrendered the $4,000 note to Connolly’s attorney.\r\n\r\nThese charges were investigated by the Grievance Committee of the\r\nBar Association; the report of that committee confirmed every charge\r\nmade. Refusing to recognize the jurisdiction of the Bar Association,\r\nJustice Cohalan requested Governor Sulzer to have the charges passed\r\nupon by the Legislature; this Governor Sulzer did in a special message\r\nembodying the report of the Grievance Committee of the Bar Association.\r\nThe Legislature ordered a trial before the Joint Judiciary Committee.\r\nJustice Cohalan admitted on the witness stand that he had made a great\r\nmistake in his dealings with Connolly, and that the money he had\r\npaid to Connolly was blackmail given in the hope of hushing up the\r\naffair for the good of his party. William D. Guthrie, representing the\r\nBar Association, reviewed the case in detail, and demanded Justice\r\nCohalan’s removal. The Joint Judiciary Committee’s report recommended\r\nthat the case against Justice Cohalan be dismissed, which report was\r\nupheld by a majority vote of the Legislature. Opponents of Tammany\r\npointed out that this was a characteristic action from a Legislature\r\ndominated by Tammany influences.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Report of the Citizens’ Committee Appointed at the Cooper Union\r\nMeeting, August 12, 1912_, pp. 6-7.\r\n\r\n[2] _Preliminary Legislative Report of Special Committee of Board of\r\nAldermen_, p. 6.\r\n\r\n[3] An extended interview published in the New York _Evening Mail_,\r\nOctober 20 and 21, 1913.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nGOVERNOR SULZER’S IMPEACHMENT AND TAMMANY’S DEFEAT\r\n\r\n1913-1914\r\n\r\n\r\nThe campaign of retaliation against Governor Sulzer soon came to a\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 1913, a committee called the Frawley Committee (headed\r\nby Senator Frawley) was appointed to inquire into Governor Sulzer’s\r\nreceipts and expenditures of campaign funds. After taking testimony,\r\nthat committee submitted its report with the finding that, following\r\nhis campaign for Governor, Mr. Sulzer had omitted declaring in his\r\ncampaign statement $19,000 of contributions to his campaign fund and\r\nhad purchased, for his personal account, stocks with part of the moneys\r\nthus received.\r\n\r\nThe evidence, according to the committee’s report, showed that a total\r\nof $109,016 in cash or stock had been in Mr. Sulzer’s possession,\r\nand that this sum came from campaign contributions. Mr. Sulzer had\r\nused both cash and checks to purchase stocks; and as far as could be\r\nbrought out by the records and testimony, his Wall Street transactions\r\nwith three brokerage firms covered a total of $72,428.28, dating from\r\nJanuary 1, 1912. It appeared that the greater part of these payments\r\nwere made after he became a candidate for Governor and was elected to\r\nthat office. Mr. Murphy and other Tammany leaders pointed out that\r\nwhile these very transactions had been going on, Mr. Sulzer had in his\r\npublic speeches pretended that he was a poor man.\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer’s own version was that if he had made a mistake in signing\r\nhis campaign statement it was due to haste and carelessness and not to\r\nintent to deceive. “But,” he added,\r\n\r\n    “this is not the only explanation of the failure to itemize\r\n    certain moneys which were received in the campaign. Some of\r\n    the moneys were not for campaign purposes at all, but were\r\n    loans. They were given to me by friends who knew I was heavily\r\n    in debt, and who loaned me the money to pay my debts or to use\r\n    as I saw fit. These friends wanted nothing, and in case of my\r\n    election I knew there was nothing they would ask me to do, or\r\n    that I could do for them. Politics had nothing to do with the\r\n    matter.\r\n\r\n    “All the moneys given to me, or sent to me for the campaign,\r\n    were turned over to the committee, to which reference has been\r\n    made, or were subsequently given to Mr. Murphy. Whether the\r\n    latter turned these moneys over to the State Committee or not\r\n    I cannot say, but an investigation of the report filed by that\r\n    committee negatives the assumption.”\r\n\r\nOn August 13, 1913, the Assembly, by a vote of 79 to 45, impeached\r\nGovernor Sulzer on eight articles. Trial by the High Court for the\r\nTrial of Impeachments, consisting of the State Senate and the Judges of\r\nthe Court of Appeals, followed.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sulzer vigorously fought back, and public opinion was\r\ngreatly aroused over his charges that the affair was simply a case of\r\nthe Tammany “Organization” summarily disciplining him for refusing\r\nto be its tool. He was convicted on three of the eight articles of\r\nimpeachment: (1) that he had filed with the Secretary of State a false\r\nsworn statement of his campaign receipts and expenditures; (2) perjury\r\nin swearing to the truth of the campaign accounting; (3) committing\r\na misdemeanor in suppressing evidence and preventing or seeking to\r\nprevent witnesses from appearing before the legislative committee. On\r\nOctober 17, 1913, Governor Sulzer was removed from office by a vote of\r\n43 to 12 by the High Court for the Trial of Impeachments.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that Chief Justice Edgar M. Cullen, of the Court\r\nof Appeals, who presided at the trial, voted to acquit Mr. Sulzer on\r\nevery one of the articles. “Never before the present case,” said Chief\r\nJustice Cullen, “has it been attempted to impeach a public officer for\r\nacts committed when he was not an officer of the State.…” Chief Justice\r\nCullen held that Mr. Sulzer had committed no offense in failing to\r\nstate the amounts and sources of his campaign contributions, and that\r\nthere was no evidence of any deceit or fraud.\r\n\r\nGovernor Sulzer’s supporters set forth the following as the main actual\r\nreasons why proceedings for his removal were pushed:\r\n\r\nFirst: Mr. Sulzer’s persistent efforts to secure the enactment of the\r\nFull Crew legislation to conserve human life on the railroads.\r\n\r\nSecond: Mr. Sulzer’s success in securing the enactment of the laws that\r\nhe recommended to compel honest dealings on the New York Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nThird: Mr. Sulzer’s refusal to approve the McKee Public Schools Bills\r\nwhich would have given control of public schools to a religious\r\ndenomination.\r\n\r\nFourth: Mr. Sulzer’s successful efforts in causing the repeal of the\r\nnotorious charter of the Long Sault Development Company, by which the\r\nState of New York received back its greatest water power and the most\r\nvaluable of its natural resources.\r\n\r\nFifth: Mr. Sulzer’s defiance of the bosses-big and little--and his\r\nfight for honest and genuine direct primaries.\r\n\r\nSixth: Mr. Sulzer’s determined refusal to be a proxy Governor or “a\r\nrubber stamp.”\r\n\r\nSeventh: Mr. Sulzer’s absolute refusal to follow “boss” dictation\r\nregarding legislation and appointments, and his blunt refusal to call\r\noff Blake and Hennessy, and stop the investigations which were being\r\nmade, under his direction, to uncover fraud and expose graft in the\r\nState Departments.\r\n\r\nEighth: Mr. Sulzer’s moral courage, in the performance of public duty,\r\nwherein he insisted on the trial and punishment of Senator Stilwell for\r\nextortion.\r\n\r\nNinth: Mr. Sulzer’s determination to set in motion the machinery of the\r\nlaw, in various counties of the State, to indict the grafters and bring\r\nthem to justice.\r\n\r\nThere could be no questioning that the proceedings against Sulzer had\r\nan effect upon the public mind the reverse of that expected by “Boss”\r\nMurphy and his advisers.\r\n\r\nThe attempt of Tammany Hall’s leaders to pose in this case as the\r\nconservers of political virtue met with a sardonic reception and\r\nquickly reacted upon them in unmistakable terms. Public opinion in\r\ngeneral made no attempt to mitigate Mr. Sulzer’s acts, but, with a keen\r\nperception of the fundamental facts, it saw that the real reason why\r\nGovernor Sulzer was so brutally punished was not because of those acts\r\nbut because he had finally broken away from Tammany dictation and had\r\nsought to be somewhat of an independent Governor. Every intelligent\r\nperson knew that this was his crime in the view of the Tammany\r\norganization, and, according to Tammany standards, the worst crime that\r\ncould be committed. That an organization which had been steeped in\r\ncorruption and graft should so ostentatiously pretend to be the exposer\r\nand punisher of infractions in an official who had defied its power,\r\nexcited mockery, resentment and indignation. Public sympathy turned\r\ntoward the deposed Governor, and he was nominated for the Assembly by\r\nthe Progressives in an East Side district.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, one of the chief issues upon which Gaynor had made\r\nhis Mayoralty campaign in 1909 was for municipally built and operated\r\nsubways.\r\n\r\nAfter becoming Mayor, he underwent a decided change of mind. The\r\nsubway rights were awarded to the Interborough Rapid Transit Company\r\nand the Brooklyn Rapid Transit Company. The Final Report of the Joint\r\nLegislative Committee appointed to investigate the Public Service\r\nCommissions severely criticizes the policy and the terms under which\r\nthe contracts were made by the Public Service Commission and the Board\r\nof Estimate. On the other hand, defenders of the Board of Estimate’s\r\naction point out that the reasons why that Board changed from city to\r\ncompany subways were that by the cooperation of the companies, the city\r\nhad the benefit of $150,000,000 more in funds than would have been\r\nthe case without that cooperation; that the new subway lines instead\r\nof being independent, disconnected routes, unrelated to existing\r\ntransportation lines, would be built in appropriate extenso of subway\r\nfacilities already in operation; and that by this arrangement not\r\nonly would the service be harmonized and improved but the payment of\r\ndouble fares would be done away with and an aggregate of vast sums thus\r\nsaved to the traveling public. The circular routes by which the city’s\r\ntransportation problems will be more effectively and constructively\r\nsolved were adopted despite Gaynor’s favoring the Interborough Rapid\r\nTransit Company’s perpendicular routes plan.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the testimony later before the Joint Legislative\r\nCommittee especially attracting public attention was the imputation\r\nthat in the contract for the third-tracking of the Interborough\r\nRapid Transit Company’s elevated railroads, a fund of $2,000,000\r\nwas surreptitiously provided in the form of a commission to John F.\r\nStevens. Formerly Mr. Stevens had been associated in the construction\r\nof the Panama Canal with Mr. Shonts who now was president of the\r\nInterborough Rapid Transit Company. This company, in the third-tracking\r\nwork, wanted exemption from supervision by the Public Service\r\nCommission. According to a memorandum preserved by George W. Young,\r\nan Interborough director, this contract with Mr. Stevens was entered\r\ninto (so, it was asserted, Mr. Shonts told Mr. Lane, another director),\r\nbecause “in connection with the securing of the contract which had been\r\nclosed between the City of Greater New York and the Interborough, Mr.\r\nShonts had found it necessary to make certain commitments and incur\r\ncertain obligations, and that it was by means of the Stevens contract\r\nthat he expected to meet and pay these commitments and obligations.”[1]\r\n\r\nThe Joint Legislative Committee thus comments on the testimony: “It\r\nis perfectly clear that Mr. Shonts did tell Mr. Lane something about\r\ncommitments and obligations in respect to this strange proposition;\r\nit is equally clear that he was not under any business commitment or\r\nhonorable obligation to Mr. Stevens. He made a request of the Public\r\nService [Commission] Chairman for an exception from the general\r\ncontract, relieving third tracking from official supervision, and\r\nhad told the reason for it in his desire to give the contract to Mr.\r\nStevens. He did obtain exemption from supervision, and that applied to\r\nthe contractor to whom finally the contract was awarded.”[2]\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the Public Service Commission here referred to was\r\nEdward E. McCall. Whatever may be the shadowy implications conveyed in\r\nthis report, no statement is made that any corruption was used, nor is\r\nany proof presented that any official was improperly influenced. The\r\nsalient fact was that McCall, in an era when corporation activities\r\nwere more and more rigorously scrutinized by official bodies, should\r\nhave reverted to by-gone standards and graciously allowed a removal\r\nof that very supervision which it was expected the Public Service\r\nCommission would insist upon exercising.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall’s nominee in the municipal campaign of 1913 was this same\r\nEdward E. McCall.\r\n\r\nWhen an attorney, Mr. McCall had been connected with certain operations\r\nof the New York Life Insurance Company, of which corporation his\r\nbrother, John A. McCall, was president. It appeared from the testimony\r\nbefore the Legislative Insurance Investigating Committee, in 1905, that\r\nEdward E. McCall had given notes, totalling about $10,000, to “Andy”\r\nHamilton, the chief legislative lobbyist at Albany of that company and\r\ndistributor of the “Yellow Dog Fund.”\r\n\r\nPrecisely why Edward E. McCall should have given those notes was\r\nnot explained. Hamilton received great sums in all for legislative\r\npurposes; in the transferring of some of the sums Edward E. McCall\r\nfigured. Both Edward E. McCall and “Andy” Hamilton received “excessive\r\nremuneration” from the New York Life Insurance Company, apparently for\r\nlegal services in a certain case, which sums, according to the report\r\nof Charles E. Hughes, there was no adequate reason for paying. At the\r\nsame time that these sums were paid to them, both Edward E. McCall and\r\nHamilton were under a regular retainer as attorneys by the New York\r\nLife Insurance Company, each of them receiving $10,000 a year.\r\n\r\nMr. McCall was put upon the Supreme Court Bench in 1902, by Tammany\r\nbacking, and remained there until his appointment, in 1913, by Governor\r\nSulzer as Chairman of the Public Service Commission, First District.\r\n\r\nThe greatest exertions were made by Tammany to sway the electorate\r\nso as to swing the election in its favor. Tammany realized that the\r\nSulzer episode would be an important issue, but it did not anticipate\r\nthat the summary removal of Governor Sulzer, with all the attendant\r\ncircumstances, would make so unpleasant an impression, driving large\r\nnumbers of voters to the other side. Tammany thought that it had\r\nput Sulzer on the defensive; it did not quite foresee the effect\r\nof revelations which, before the campaign was over, placed Tammany\r\nseriously on the defensive and its leaders under the necessity of\r\nmaking explanations.\r\n\r\nMoreover, in selecting its candidates and developing its campaign\r\ntactics Tammany did not appreciate the very much altered attitude of a\r\nlarge section of the public toward municipal politics. There had arisen\r\nin New York City an increased public demand for proved administrative\r\ncapacity. The old days of public toleration of choosing politicians for\r\n“good fellowship” or subservient qualities had about gone. The emphasis\r\nwas now placed by Tammany’s opponents upon the fact that cities should\r\nbe not merely governed, but well governed, by men of vision, ability\r\nand integrity.\r\n\r\nThe candidate for Mayor of the Republicans and Fusionists was John\r\nPurroy Mitchel, a young Independent Democrat, who was credited with\r\nhaving made a notable record as Commissioner of Accounts. Later he had\r\nbeen President of the Board of Aldermen, and then Collector of the\r\nPort of New York. Nominated with him were William A. Prendergast, for\r\nComptroller, and George McAneny for President of the Board of Aldermen;\r\nall were eulogized by their supporters with having served the city with\r\nconstructive ability and marked efficiency, and with having opposed and\r\nexposed Tammany graft and extravagance.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist Party’s candidate for Mayor was Charles Edward Russell, a\r\nwriter of note and a man of high personal character.\r\n\r\nFull of bitterness was this campaign. Perhaps the most effective\r\nspeakers against Tammany Hall were John A. Hennessy and former\r\nGovernor Sulzer. Mr. Hennessy in a public speech on October 23, 1913,\r\nspecifically charged that he held a note for $35,000 that had been\r\nsigned by a Justice of the Supreme Court who had been Mr. Murphy’s\r\nalternative candidate for Mayor. “I do not say that the $35,000 was\r\never paid to anybody. I don’t suspect him of any vices that would\r\ninduce him to borrow $35,000.… If he has had to pay $35,000 or more for\r\nhis [Supreme Court] nomination, why he simply followed a tradition in\r\nthe organization to which he belonged.”\r\n\r\nMr. Hennessy charged Mr. McCall with not answering the question of\r\nwhere he got his campaign money, and asked Mr. McCall whether, in 1902\r\n(when McCall was a candidate for the Supreme Court nomination) he,\r\nMcCall, had not met George W. Plunkett, a Tammany district leader--the\r\noriginator of the term “honest graft”--in a room in the Hoffman House,\r\nand whether Anthony N. Brady was not in another room at the same\r\ntime. “I want to ask Judge McCall,” Mr. Hennessy continued, “whether\r\nhis sponsor, Charlie Murphy, had not seen Anthony Brady in respect\r\nto McCall’s nomination in the Hoffman House, and I want to ask Judge\r\nMcCall if the gentleman who brought him and Plunkett together to\r\ndiscuss that nomination, did not have something to do with Murphy and\r\nMr. Brady in respect of that nomination.” Mr. Hennessy charged that one\r\nman that Mr. McCall paid was Plunkett, but he (Hennessy) did not know\r\nwhether he paid Murphy, or whether he paid the amount to somebody who\r\npaid Murphy; he (Hennessy) did not undertake to assert that.\r\n\r\nThe Anthony N. Brady here mentioned was a traction magnate, who,\r\nbeginning as a clerk in Albany, had by means of legislative\r\nmanipulation giving richly valuable railway and other franchises,\r\naccumulated an estate of $90,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn several speeches Mr. Hennessy pointedly asserted that James Stewart,\r\na contractor, had paid $25,000 to a former friend of Charles F. Murphy,\r\nand inquired whether J. Sergeant Cram (a prominent Tammany light) had\r\nnot received $5,000, and Norman E. Mack another $5,000.\r\n\r\nAt a public meeting on October 25, 1913, Mr. Sulzer declared that he\r\nhad sent to Charles F. Murphy $10,000 that Allan Ryan (Thomas F. Ryan’s\r\nson), had contributed to his campaign fund, and that Mr. Murphy had\r\nnever accounted for it.\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer named John H. Delaney (later State Commissioner of the\r\nDepartment of Efficiency and Economy), as the messenger who had\r\ncarried the $10,000 in bills to Mr. Murphy. This money, Mr. Sulzer\r\nasserted, had originally been handed to him (Sulzer) in his New York\r\noffice by Mr. McGlone, Allan Ryan’s secretary, and that he (Sulzer)\r\ngave the $10,000 to Delaney, who took it uptown and gave it to Murphy.\r\n“Late that afternoon,” Mr. Sulzer continued, “I saw Mr. Murphy at\r\nDelmonico’s. During our conversation, I said, ‘Did John give you the\r\nten from Ryan?’ Mr. Murphy replied: ‘Yes, that’s all right, but it’s\r\nonly a drop in the bucket. You’ll have to do better than that.’ So far\r\nas I know,” Mr. Sulzer continued, “and I am pretty well advised, Mr.\r\nMurphy never accounted for that $10,000, any more than he accounted\r\nfor the Brady $25,000 which I refused and which he accepted from\r\nJudge Beardsley [Brady’s legal representative]. At all events, I\r\nthink Mr. Murphy should tell the voters what he did with the money.”\r\nMr. Sulzer declared that he (Sulzer) was still in debt, and that\r\n“I am a poorer man to-day than I was when I became a candidate for\r\nGovernor.” No one acquainted with Sulzer’s career could doubt that had\r\nhe been essentially corrupt, he could have become a millionaire from\r\nhuckstering of legislation when he was Speaker of the Assembly; there\r\nwas no bribing him, however, with money; he was, in fact, a poor man.\r\n\r\nMr. Sulzer then declared that Thomas F. Ryan was “Boss” Murphy’s master.\r\n\r\nThis, in fact, was the very point made by the Socialists: that the\r\npolitical “bosses” were only the tools of the great financial and\r\nindustrial magnates; and that where the political “bosses” gathered\r\nin their millions, the magnates accumulated their tens or hundreds of\r\nmillions of dollars as their individual fortunes. Why, queried the\r\nSocialists, concentrate attention on the instruments? Why not, said\r\nthey, attack the power of the whole social, political and industrial\r\nsystem of which the political “boss” was merely one expression? This\r\nsystem, according to the Socialist party, was the capitalist system\r\nfor the overthrow of which they declared and agitated. They pointed\r\nout that behind Mr. Murphy and Tammany Hall, as well as behind the\r\nRepublican organization where it was in power, were traction, railroad,\r\ntelephone, electric lighting, industrial and other financial interests\r\nall selfishly utilizing the power embodied in political “bosses” for\r\ntheir own ends and aggrandizement, and that these were the real powers\r\nthat could make and unmake political “bosses.”\r\n\r\nGaffney, Cram and Plunkett had all denied allegations aimed at them;\r\nMurphy and McCall had remained silent. But on October 26, 1913, McCall\r\nand Murphy both issued statements. Mr. McCall denied the charge that\r\nhe had paid $35,000 for the nomination for the Supreme Court in 1902.\r\nMr. Murphy made public an affidavit in which he (Murphy) denied that\r\nMcCall had ever paid him anything at any time, and branding the charge\r\nas false. On the next day Mr. Murphy gave out a long statement making\r\na sweeping denial of Mr. Sulzer’s statements; he asserted that he had\r\nreceived the $25,000 from Anthony N. Brady, but that he had returned\r\nthe money the next day; he also denied that he had ever received\r\n$10,000 from Ryan.\r\n\r\nMr. Hennessy returned to the attack. On the same day he charged that\r\na seat in the United States Senate (to succeed Senator Root) had been\r\noffered to Sulzer if he would yield to Mr. Murphy, and that it was Mr.\r\nMcCall who acted as the intermediary.\r\n\r\nIn a public speech on the following day, October 28, 1913, Mr. Hennessy\r\ndemanded the tracing of Mr. Brady’s $25,000, and suggested that it\r\nmight be well to examine the executors of Brady’s estate and find out\r\nwhether Brady had deposited $25,000 two days after Judge Beardsley\r\nhad handed that money to Mr. Murphy. “I knew Mr. Brady very well,”\r\nMr. Hennessy went on. “I have known Mr. Brady since he was selling\r\ngroceries in Albany twenty-five or twenty-six years ago, … and I know\r\nthat he never carried around $25,000 in bills every day in his pocket;\r\nso if he got this $25,000 in bills from Mr. Murphy, he undoubtedly\r\ndeposited it somewhere.” Mr. Hennessy chided Mr. Murphy with having\r\nbeen told by his district leaders to answer him, after he (Murphy) had\r\ndeclared that he would not notice the charges, and said that Mr. Murphy\r\nwas “shoving it off on a dead man.”\r\n\r\nWhen, on October 29, 1913, former Judge Beardsley, counsel for the\r\nBrady estate, issued a statement asserting that the $25,000 was\r\nreturned to Brady, Mr. Hennessy in a public speech demanded proof and\r\ncharged that an alibi was being proved over the body of a dead man.\r\nMr. Hennessy made the charge that in the campaign of 1910 Mr. Murphy\r\nhad collected fully $150,000 for which he had not accounted in the\r\nstatement filed with the Secretary of State. “Most of this money,” Mr.\r\nHennessy declared, “came from contractors who were clubbed into giving\r\nit.”\r\n\r\nSo this exciting campaign drew to a close amid sensational charges,\r\ncounter charges, denials and reiterations.\r\n\r\nOver in Queen’s Borough, the Democratic “boss” of that section,\r\n“Joe” Cassidy, was in serious difficulties; he had long, with some\r\nintermissions, ruled that part of the city; and although he was not a\r\nTammany man, nor did Tammany rule Queens, in the strict sense of the\r\nmeaning, yet he was an ally of Tammany and had always “consulted” Mr.\r\nMurphy.\r\n\r\nLocal “Boss” Cassidy and one of his lieutenants were under indictment\r\nfor conspiring in selling a nomination in 1911, to the Supreme Court\r\nBench to William Willett, Jr., and Willett was indicted for being a\r\nparty to the conspiracy. During his trial later, Cassidy admitted that\r\nhe was “boss,” but asserted his honesty. Questioned as to why he did\r\nnot deposit a certain sum in bank, he replied, “I was used to carrying\r\nmoney in my pocket. I was lonesome without a roll in my pocket.” It\r\nmay be said here that Willett was convicted, and likewise were Cassidy\r\nand one of his lieutenants by a jury on February 2, 1914; Cassidy and\r\nWillett were each sentenced to an indeterminate sentence of not less\r\nthan a year in prison and a fine of $1,000, and Cassidy’s lieutenant\r\n“go-between,” Louis T. Walter, received a sentence of three months and\r\na fine of $1,000. After serving a year in prison Cassidy was released\r\nand later (January 19, 1917) was restored to citizenship by Governor\r\nWhitman.\r\n\r\nIntelligent people contemplated with wonderment the antiquated tactics\r\nthat Tammany Hall was blindly following. Although the discussion of\r\npressing economic problems was vitally concerning great masses of\r\npeople, Tammany Hall seemed unaware of their existence. The rapid\r\ndevelopment of the trusts, the concentration of capitalist power and\r\nwealth, the tense unrest among different classes of people, were\r\nreflected in various political and industrial movements, but in Tammany\r\nHall no attention was given to them. Oblivious to the great industrial\r\nchanges and popular agitations and thought, Tammany still adhered to\r\nits old semi-feudalistic methods of “carrying its vote”; it concerned\r\nitself only with matters of offices, jobs, contracts and interested\r\nlegislation; it depended upon immense campaign funds and the personal\r\nfollowing of its leaders in marshaling the army of voters all of whom\r\nby jobs or other such self interest sought to perpetuate its power.\r\n\r\nNew York City had also grown too vast for the Tammany district leaders\r\nto control as they did in the decades when it was smaller and compact.\r\nGreat numbers of people had moved from Manhattan to other boroughs;\r\nand this constant process of migration had much weakened the power of\r\nTammany organization leaders in keeping in touch with the voters. The\r\nJewish vote had grown to enormous proportions, and so had the Italian,\r\nbut the Jewish vote was generally a vote racially independent of\r\nTammany and not particularly sympathetic to the character, racial and\r\nreligious, of its leaders.\r\n\r\nTammany Hall was overwhelmingly defeated. Mr. Mitchel’s plurality was\r\n124,262. The vote resulted: Mitchel, 358,181; McCall, 233,919; Russell,\r\n32,057. All of the anti-Tammany candidates for city offices were\r\nelected by varying pluralities. Mr. Sulzer was triumphantly elected to\r\nthe Assembly. However, Tammany men could glean some slight consolation\r\nin this hour of disaster; Lieutenant Governor Martin Glynn, who had\r\nsucceeded Sulzer as Governor, could be generally depended upon to\r\nappoint some Tammany men to various appointive offices; when his list\r\nof appointments was handed down they were not altogether disappointed.\r\nTammany was especially jubilant in getting control of the Public\r\nService Commission, not to mention a firmer hold in various State\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nThe results of the municipal election cut Tammany off from city, county\r\nand national patronage; in such an extremity Mr. Murphy had little\r\nto offer famishing followers except soothing words which counted for\r\nnothing where practical results were demanded.\r\n\r\nThe mutterings against Mr. Murphy in certain quarters grew to open\r\nrebellion; no longer was he fulsomely praised as a sagacious political\r\nstrategist; he was now derisively called a stupid blunderer for his\r\nsuccessive actions and particularly for his campaign of reprisal\r\nagainst Sulzer--a campaign producing so inflaming an effect against\r\nTammany.\r\n\r\nA resolution introduced in the Democratic Club, on February 2, 1914,\r\ndemanded that he retire from “all participation in the party’s\r\naffairs,” to which Mr. Murphy defiantly replied in an interview, “I\r\nam the leader of Tammany Hall. You can add that I am going to remain\r\nthe leader of Tammany Hall no matter what some others might think they\r\nhave to say about it.” Believing that at least thirty-two of the\r\nthirty-four Tammany district leaders would vote to continue him in\r\npower, “Boss” Murphy made this announcement with apparent confidence.\r\nIndeed, it was reported that the Executive Committee of Tammany Hall\r\nhad voted to retain his leadership.\r\n\r\nA few days later some extracts from a letter written by Richard Croker\r\nto John Fox were made public. “Murphy was a big handicap to McCall,”\r\nMr. Croker wrote. “The Hall will never win under Murphy’s management. I\r\nhope some good man will get in and drive all them grafters contractors\r\nout.” On March 10, 1914, at a meeting of the Democratic Club, Charles\r\nF. Murphy, James E. Gaffney, Thomas F. Foley, George W. Plunkett and\r\nThomas Darlington were rudely read out of that club on the nominal\r\nground of non-payment of dues, whereupon Thomas F. Smith, Secretary of\r\nTammany Hall, styled that action “a joke” and declared that “the club\r\nhas cut no figure locally since 1896.”\r\n\r\nMr. Murphy remained “the Chief” of Tammany Hall.\r\n\r\nThe various official inquiries into the system of graft in State\r\ncontracts conducted by Special Commissioner James W. Osborne and\r\nother officials continued after the election. In January, 1914, Bart\r\nDunn, an associate Tammany leader of the Eighteenth Assembly District\r\nand a close friend of Charles F. Murphy, was convicted of conspiracy\r\nin highways construction graft, and sentenced to ten months in the\r\npenitentiary and to pay a fine of $500; he took an appeal and was let\r\nout on bail. Subsequently, however, he was compelled to serve six\r\nmonths in prison.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 1914, after he had been summoned to testify again in\r\nan investigation by District Attorney Whitman, State Treasurer John J.\r\nKennedy committed suicide. As State Treasurer, Kennedy was ex-officio\r\na member of the State Canal Board which had control of contracts now\r\nunder investigation; his son was, in conjunction with others, one of\r\nwhom was under indictment, in the business of bonding contractors on\r\ncanal and other State work. It was believed that worry arising from the\r\nforthcoming examination as to his son’s transactions, was the cause of\r\nKennedy’s suicide.\r\n\r\nAt a hearing conducted by the District Attorney’s office, in New York\r\nCity, on February 26, 1914, Mr. Sulzer again related, this time in\r\ntestimony, the story of the $25,000 campaign contribution by Anthony N.\r\nBrady and that of $10,000 by Allan Ryan, both of which contributions\r\nwere made in 1912. “Once,” Mr. Sulzer testified, “in a talk with\r\nMurphy, he told me that Ryan had given a check for $25,000 in 1912.\r\nMurphy said that he would report that, but not the $10,000. He said\r\nhe would find a dummy for that. He also found dummies for Brady’s\r\n$25,000.” Mr. Sulzer explained that a certain $25,000 that Mr. Murphy\r\nhad returned to Brady was not the $25,000 that Brady had contributed to\r\nthe campaign of 1912. Brady, so Mr. Sulzer testified, had sued Murphy\r\nfor $40,000 and Murphy had settled the suit for $25,000; the records\r\nwould disclose this suit, Mr. Sulzer said.\r\n\r\nThus far some of the smaller grafters have been convicted and sentenced\r\nto jail, but the really powerful politicians involved have not\r\nsuffered. After two months’ consideration of the charges of graft and\r\nofficial misconduct brought against C. Gordon Reel, State Engineer John\r\nA. Bensel, Duncan W. Peck, State Superintendent of Public Works--the\r\nthree officials forming the highways Commission under the régime of\r\nwhich, it was charged, the large grafting had been going on--the Albany\r\nCounty Grand Jury, on April 28, 1914, reported that no indictments had\r\nbeen found against any of these men, nor against Charles A. Foley,\r\nDeputy Superintendent of Highways. According to facts disclosed by\r\nMr. Osborne’s investigation, many of the 318 repair contracts let by\r\nFoley and passed by Reel, Bensel and Peck, were awarded only after\r\ncontractors had contributed to the Democratic campaign fund. Numerous\r\nof the roads covered by these contracts were so badly constructed\r\nthat they went to pieces within a year; and the State, so Mr. Osborne\r\ncharged, thereby lost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n[1] _Final Report of the Joint Legislative Committee Appointed to\r\nInvestigate the Public Service Commissions_, March, 1917, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[2] _Ibid._, p. 68.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nTAMMANY’S PRESENT STATUS\r\n\r\n1914-1917\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon the removal of Governor Sulzer from office, Martin Glynn, as has\r\nalready been noted, had become Governor of New York State. A Democrat,\r\nhe consequently appointed men of the party to which he belonged to\r\nvarious offices. Tammany and its auxiliaries now had control of the\r\nPublic Service Commission, First District.\r\n\r\nBut this control was abruptly ended by the effect of the disclosures\r\nmade in the testimony before the (Thompson) Joint Legislative Committee\r\nprobing into the affairs of the Public Service Commissions. Mr. Glynn\r\nwas succeeded as Governor by Charles S. Whitman who had done such\r\nnotable service as District Attorney of New York County. During 1915\r\nthe Joint Legislative Committee held many hearings at which much\r\ntestimony of an upheaving nature was given.\r\n\r\nOne result of this inquiry was a series of grave charges against\r\nEdward E. McCall, Chairman of the Public Service Commission, First\r\nDistrict, and, as we have seen, recent candidate of Tammany Hall for\r\nMayor. Accompanied, by a request for Mr. McCall’s removal from office,\r\nthese charges were made to Governor Whitman by the Joint Legislative\r\nCommittee on December 12, 1915, and were supplemented by a bill of\r\nparticulars, specifying twenty charges, formally filed ten days later.\r\n\r\nThe charges declared that Mr. McCall’s acceptance of his appointment\r\nto the Public Service Commission was in violation of law; that he was\r\nat the time the owner of stock in a corporation subject to the Public\r\nService Commission’s supervision; that thereafter he attempted to\r\ntransfer this stock to his wife “which attempt was a mere subterfuge\r\nand a clumsy effort to evade the statute”; and that as Chairman of\r\nthe Public Service Commission he participated in the consideration of\r\nmatters affecting the value of this stock.\r\n\r\nFurther, the charges accused Mr. McCall of accepting a retainer for\r\nlegal services from a corporation, the chief owner of the stock of\r\nwhich was commonly reputed to be a controlling factor in the management\r\nof the Interborough Rapid Transit Company; and that in another case\r\nhe accepted a retainer in an action then pending in the Supreme Court\r\n“in which action the engineers in the employ of the Public Service\r\nCommission will be necessary as material witnesses.” Other charges\r\nspecified that he favored the public service corporations to the\r\ndetriment of public interests. The sixteenth charge particularized\r\nthat in the matter of the third tracking of the elevated railroads\r\nin Manhattan he failed to reserve the power of supervision to the\r\nCommission “and that as a result of such failure the lessee of\r\nthe Manhattan Railway Company [the Interborough] has entered into\r\nextravagant and improvident contracts under which its stockholders and\r\nthe people of the City of New York have suffered and will suffer large\r\nlosses”. The seventeenth charge arraigned McCall for having authorized\r\nthe construction of connecting lines by the Interborough Rapid Transit\r\nCompany “at an extravagant and exorbitant price and without competition\r\nto the disadvantage of the city of New York and its inhabitants.” The\r\neighteenth charge set forth that in the execution of the dual subway\r\ncontracts “he permitted the inclusion of a provision under which the\r\nNew York Municipal Railway Corporation will be permitted unwarrantedly\r\nto deduct from the earnings of that company, before the division of the\r\nnet earnings between the company and the city can be accomplished, a\r\nsum aggregating more than $10,000,000.” In brief, the charges declared\r\nthat McCall showed misconduct in office, favoritism, neglect of duty,\r\nand inefficiency.\r\n\r\nAfter consideration of the charges, Governor Whitman, on December 6,\r\n1915, removed Mr. McCall from office as the Chairman of the Public\r\nService Commission, First District. The particular charge substantiated\r\nwas that McCall violated that section of the Public Service Commissions\r\nlaw forbidding a Commissioner to hold stock in a corporation subject to\r\nthe Commission’s supervision.\r\n\r\nMcCall, however, was not the only Public Service Commissioner involved\r\nin the revelations before the Joint Legislative Committee. At a session\r\non December 16, 1915, Sidney G. Johnson, vice-president of the General\r\nRailway Signal Company, testified that Robert Colgate Wood, another\r\nPublic Service Commissioner, demanded $5,000 from the Union Switch and\r\nSignal Company for using his influence as Commissioner to give that\r\ncompany a subway signal system contract. The offer, it was testified,\r\nwas refused. On January 25, 1916, the Grand Jury in New York County\r\nindicted Mr. Wood for the alleged solicitation of a bribe. Meanwhile,\r\non December 27, 1915, George V. S. Williams, another Public Service\r\nCommissioner, resigned from office on the plea that for some time he\r\nhad been contemplating this step, and now that he was no longer “under\r\nfire” he could retire in justice to himself.\r\n\r\nSerious as these developments were, they did not have the damaging\r\neffect upon Tammany that might ordinarily be supposed. Except in\r\ncertain offices here and there Tammany was out of power, and therefore,\r\nnot being prominently on the defensive, could not be effectively\r\nassailed. Moreover, in view of the results of a recently tried libel\r\nsuit, it was anything but a propitious time for Tammany’s Republican\r\nopponents to make capital from such incidents.\r\n\r\nThis libel action, which conspicuously held public attention, was\r\none brought by William Barnes, Jr., Republican State leader, against\r\nTheodore Roosevelt. In a published article, Colonel Roosevelt had\r\npractically charged that there was a corrupt alliance between Mr.\r\nBarnes and Charles F. Murphy, the Tammany leader, and that Mr. Barnes\r\nhad worked through a corrupt alliance between crooked business and\r\ncrooked politics. The article did not charge personal corruption in the\r\nsense of bribery, but emphasized the nature of the political methods\r\nused. The trial of this action resulted, on May 22, 1915, in the jury\r\nfinding a verdict in favor of Roosevelt.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of this trial directed general notice much more to the\r\nworkings of the Republican machine system than to Tammany methods.\r\nTo the initiated it had long been known that the Republican machine,\r\nas the power usually controlling the Legislature, was the preferred\r\ninstrument through which the powerful financial, industrial, utility,\r\ncommercial and other corporations operated to get the legislation\r\nthat they wanted. This fact was now confirmed and disseminated by\r\nthe outcome of the libel suit. Long, too, had it been suspected that\r\nbetween the apparently hostile political machines there often existed\r\nsecret understandings or alliances cloaked over by pretended political\r\nwarfare which was merely mock opposition intended for credulous public\r\nconsumption. The court proceedings and the verdict showed that the\r\nstating of this fact was not a libel.\r\n\r\nThe effect upon public opinion of this libel action was far more\r\ninjurious to the Republican State organization than to Tammany, a\r\nreaction naturally to be expected in judging an organization which\r\nhad so long found campaign material in strong virtuous denunciations\r\nof “Tammany corruption.” At the same time public disfavor of the\r\nRepublican organization was increased by the bad record of the\r\nRepublican Legislature in 1915--a record that in many respects was\r\nworse than that of a Tammany Legislature. These influences were to\r\nTammany’s advantage. Always rushing to excesses when in prosperity,\r\nTammany in times of adversity moderated its action by observing\r\nprudence and deferring to public proprieties. Its chief candidates in\r\nthe 1915 election were men of accredited good character and reputed\r\nability. These conditions, together with the fact that the Republicans\r\nand the Progressives did not unite in opposition to Tammany, helped\r\nto bring a measure of success to Tammany. For the first time in more\r\nthan fifteen years Tammany managed to elect a District Attorney in the\r\nCounty of New York in the person of Judge Edward Swann, and it elected\r\nAlfred E. Smith to the office of Sheriff.\r\n\r\nFrom the beginning of 1916 Tammany was thus in full control of the\r\ncriminal machinery of the law in New York County. District Attorney\r\nSwann showed such energy in the sustained prosecution of the infamous\r\n“white slavers,” that the formulating of charges against him came as\r\na surprise to many citizens who had formed a good estimate of his\r\nactivities in office. These charges, made by Judge James A. Delahanty\r\nof the Court of General Sessions, on December 30, 1916, alleged\r\nmisconduct in office in the matter of certain assault cases resulting\r\nfrom the garment trades strike of 1914.\r\n\r\nIn the list of charges forwarded to Governor Whitman Judge Delahanty\r\naccused District Attorney Swann of having deliberately presented a\r\nfalse recommendation to a Judge of General Sessions on the strength\r\nof which he obtained the discharge on bail of more than a score of\r\ndefendants indicted in March, 1914, on various charges of assault,\r\nriots, and injuries to property occurring during the course of labor\r\ndisputes on the East Side. Judge Delahanty further charged that\r\nDistrict Attorney Swann even sought to have the indictments against\r\nthese men dismissed, although seven of them had offered to plead\r\nguilty. Judge Delahanty had been an Assistant District Attorney when\r\nMr. Whitman was District Attorney, and hence could claim an intimate\r\nfamiliarity with the details of those very cases. Among the characters\r\nconcerned in the clothing trades strike were such notorious gangsters\r\nas “Dopey Benny” Fein, “Waxy” Gordon, “Jew” Murphy and others such\r\nwidely known for their activities in the section east of the Bowery.\r\n\r\nAssistant District Attorney Lucian S. Breckinridge who had had charge\r\nof the preparation of many of these cases for trial, had resigned on\r\nMarch 28, 1916, on the ground that District Attorney Swann’s action\r\nin the cases was “a travesty on justice, and an outrage to decency,”\r\nand that he (Mr. Breckinridge) did not purpose to acquiesce in that\r\naction either actively or by silence. In his letter of resignation Mr.\r\nBreckinridge asserted that the investigation of the strike “disclosed\r\na tale of wrong and outrage, and a use of gangsters and thugs in labor\r\ntroubles unparalleled in the history of this country.” On the other\r\nhand, Morris Hillquit, chief counsel for the labor unions involved,\r\nasserted in an interview that “the indictments were based on evidence\r\nfurnished by a combination of notorious lawbreakers, who were known\r\nas such to the prosecuting officials.” Mr. Hillquit denounced their\r\nstory as “a most clumsy concoction, bearing evidence of deliberate\r\nfabrication.”\r\n\r\nAfter the filing of the charges against him, District Attorney Swann\r\ndeclared that the charges were actuated by politics. He made a bitter\r\npersonal attack upon Mr. Breckenridge, and retaliated later by causing\r\nMr. Breckinridge to be indicted upon the allegation that he had\r\nreceived a bribe from manufacturers. On January 14, 1917, the City\r\nClub presented charges to Governor Whitman and asked for District\r\nAttorney Swann’s removal from office. The first charge included Judge\r\nDelahanty’s statements, and declared that District Attorney Swann’s\r\nefforts to procure the dismissal of indictments against labor union men\r\ncharged with assault constituted an attempt to perpetrate a fraud on\r\nthe Court of General Sessions, and that its object was to pay a Tammany\r\nelection debt to East Side labor unionists. The second charge asserted\r\nthat by various means Mr. Swann had sought to coerce and intimidate\r\nMr. Breckinridge, who was a valuable witness into any inquiry into the\r\ncharges against the District Attorney.\r\n\r\nAt this writing (March, 1917), it is not possible to give the outcome\r\nof these charges; the determination of them and the decision are still\r\nto be forthcoming from Governor Whitman when sufficient time shall have\r\nbeen allowed for adequate inquiry.\r\n\r\nBy the end of 1916 the municipal administration headed by Mayor John\r\nPurroy Mitchel had been in power for three years with another year to\r\nserve. Usually in past times after a fusion administration had been\r\nin office for a year or two its unwise repressive acts only the more\r\nstrengthened Tammany, which always put forth the boast that it was\r\nthe real democratic bulwark against aristocratic property rule and\r\nthat it was the genuine representative of the masses. On this claim it\r\ngenerally had succeeded in elections for nearly two decades, returning\r\na majority of from 75,000 to 100,000 for the Democratic candidates,\r\nespecially in State and National elections. In the 1916 election\r\nTammany was able to give Wilson a plurality of only about 40,000 over\r\nHughes. To accept the results of any one particular election would be\r\nunsafe. Nevertheless, it would seem to be the case that as compared\r\nwith its past Tammany is in a moribund condition; its only large hold,\r\nthe decline of which is relieved by but an occasional victory, is in\r\nManhattan Borough. The population of Manhattan is not growing nearly as\r\nrapidly as some of the other boroughs which at the same time show an\r\nincreasing anti-Tammany or Republican tendency.\r\n\r\nWhile Tammany has been clinging to outworn tactics and aims out of\r\nkeeping with the rising standards of the times, the anti-Tammany\r\nfarces have learned much from the experiences of previous movements.\r\nLikewise they have proved responsive to the broadening currents of the\r\nage. Whatever their minor mistakes they have not regarded New York\r\nCity as an object of low political tyranny and brutal spoliation. They\r\nhave, in the main, applied constructive ability to administration, and\r\nhave evinced a keen sense not merely of the cleanly appearance and\r\nwell-ordered functions of the great city but of its architectural and\r\nother aesthetic values as well, as shown by several measures recently\r\nadopted. This is a very different condition from that prevailing during\r\nthe times when the city’s affairs were dictated by ignorant politicians\r\nwhose sole aim was to enrich themselves quickly and satisfy the\r\npredatory desires of their followers.\r\n\r\nThe anti-Tammany forces have learned, too, that repression\r\nonly nullifies in the popular mind the good effects of other\r\naccomplishments. In the last few years New York City officials have\r\nallowed absolute freedom of speech and freedom of assemblage on the\r\npublic streets, designating certain places for the purpose, and\r\nqualifying this liberty only by the salutary proviso that the speakers\r\nbe held responsible for any unlawful utterances. An instructively\r\ndifferent attitude, this, from that in days not so long gone by when\r\nassemblages of citizens were forbidden to use streets and were mauled\r\nand clubbed by the police, and when they were prohibited from holding\r\ndiscussions in public buildings.\r\n\r\nJudged by the performances of many exploiting administrations that\r\nhave ruled and robbed New York City, Mayor Mitchel’s administration\r\nhas been one of wholesome tendencies and accomplishments. Its\r\nopponents have bitterly attacked some of its policies, but however\r\nof a debatable nature these may have been or are, the antagonists of\r\nthis administration have not been able to assail it on the score of\r\nendorsed graft and incompetence as has been the case with so many\r\nother city administrations. It is not contended that evils have\r\nentirely disappeared, but at any rate the base, ignoble practices and\r\nthe repellant incompetence characteristic of past “boss” rule have\r\nbeen much supplanted by improved methods, expert judgment, technical\r\nexperience, a higher tone, and good spirit.\r\n\r\nThe police department, so long the special canker, has been placed on\r\na different basis. A recent report of the Bureau of Social Hygiene,\r\nwhich has closely investigated that department, does not claim that\r\ngraft has been entirely eliminated but it points out that “tremendous\r\ngains have been made.” The “vice ring,” it reports, has been broken\r\nup; the gambling evil has been greatly reduced; organized graft is\r\nno longer the sinister and secure system that it was. “Collusion\r\nbetween exploiters of vice and officials in the Police Department\r\nhas ceased. Petty grafting still occurs. The man on the beat may\r\ntake a small bribe to overlook a breach of the law, but protection\r\ncan no longer be purchased.” The Committee of Fourteen gives credit\r\nfor this transformation largely to the “clean-up” movement started\r\nby Police Commissioner Cropsey under Mayor Gaynor, and continued and\r\nelaborated by Police Commissioner Arthur Woods under Mayor Mitchel’s\r\nadministration. Some survivals of old standards still remain,\r\nparticularly in the selection of policemen too much for physical\r\ncapacity and not enough for technical intelligence as applied to\r\ndetective work. From these continuing old standards serious incapacity\r\nhas often resulted in the unearthing of crimes.\r\n\r\nHad New York City a homogeneous population the movement for a general\r\nelevation of civic standards would have proceeded faster. But New\r\nYork City’s conglomerate population with its polyglot diversities has\r\nnaturally presented great difficulties in the solid formation of a\r\nunity of understanding and purposes. Nevertheless the progress has\r\nbeen very considerable. In spreading its educational measures for\r\nthe conservation of health, the Health Department of New York City\r\nfor example, has obviously encountered serious obstacles, in dealing\r\nwith a heterogeneous and in many quarters a congested population.\r\nYet by intelligent perseverance it has succeeded so well that in\r\n1916, notwithstanding an infantile paralysis epidemic, the death rate\r\nwas only 13.82 per 1000--the lowest death rate in New York City’s\r\nhistory. The notable improvements brought about by these and other\r\ndepartments attest ever-increasing proficiency. Where formerly the\r\ntraditional conception of politics in New York City was one cynically\r\nregarding office as a legitimate means of spoils, graft, corruption and\r\ncorporation pillaging, new traditions have been gradually substituted.\r\nThe old influences may here and there persist, but they are no longer\r\naccepted by masses of voters as a fixed creed. The stage has been\r\npassed when the open venality of politics can be successfully flaunted;\r\nit is now the subtle influences often seeking surreptitiously to use\r\ngovernment for their own invidious ends that require the watching.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of Mayor Mitchel’s administration hold that by\r\neradicating partisan politics it has been able to concentrate its\r\nwhole attention upon the one duty of providing efficient government\r\nfor the city. They point out, that contrary to the careless methods\r\nof some former administrations, the Mitchel administration has, by\r\nprudent supervision of finances reduced the budget annually by several\r\nmillion dollars, and yet has made notable extensions in service. They\r\nfurther call attention to the fact that the Mitchel administration\r\nhas put a stop to the ruinous practice of mortgaging the credit of\r\nthe city for generations in advance. For the first time, they also\r\ntell, New York City has protested against the old arbitrary practice\r\nof making enormous State appropriations for objects in which New\r\nYork City had no share; that as result of this protest the State has\r\nalready made partial restitution; and that the program of city relief\r\nin this direction should eventually mean an annual reduction of\r\n$12,000,000 in New York City’s tax burdens. The Mitchel administration\r\nforces emphasize the great increase in the collections from taxes,\r\nassessments, water rates, docks, ferries, subway and miscellaneous\r\nrevenue. These are some of the financial improvements enumerated.\r\n\r\nIn the line of departmental progress Mayor Mitchel’s administration is\r\ncredited with a large list of reforms and innovations: The transformed\r\nmorale of the Police Department; the efficiency of the Fire Department\r\nin greatly curtailing the number of fires while at the same time that\r\ndepartment has cost $200,000 less a year than formerly; the humanizing\r\nof the activities of the Charities Department and of the correctional\r\nsystem; the progressive work of the Health, Education and other\r\ndepartments; the enterprise of the Dock Department in adding seven\r\nmiles of wharfage and vast areas of dock space to New York harbor’s\r\npiers. This is but the merest synopsis of the abundant details set\r\nforth showing what Mayor Mitchel’s administration has done.\r\n\r\nSo attractive is this record that the description may possibly seem\r\nopen to the suspicion of being one-sided, if not effusive. Recalling\r\nhow often New York City has suffered from flagrant maladministration,\r\nthe skeptic may be tempted to regard these attributed deeds as being\r\ntoo good to be true. Besides, campaign documents are to be scrutinized\r\nnot so much for their assertions as for their omissions.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the great bulk of the accomplishments of Mayor\r\nMitchel’s administration may be justly claimed by his supporters\r\nas genuine services which are bound to become fixed standards any\r\noverthrow of which will not be easily tolerated by the educated\r\npublic. These Administration annalists, however, have not separated\r\nthe reforms essentially enduring from those which by their nature are\r\nmerely experimental, as, for example, certain educational policies.\r\nBut experiments have their distinct value; better that they should be\r\ntried than inertia should prevail.\r\n\r\nOne of the few specific charges brought against Mayor Mitchel’s\r\nadministration is the assertion that a coterie of real estate\r\nspeculators has profited unduly by the sale of park sites and other\r\nreal estate to the city and State during recent years. In reply the\r\nsupporters of Mayor Mitchel’s administration say that the acquisition\r\nof these properties was indispensable to great public improvements\r\nplanned; that whatever payments have been made have been paid by the\r\nregularly determined award of the courts; and that there is not the\r\nslightest evidence of collusion on the part of city officials.\r\n\r\nThus far the opponents of Mayor Mitchel’s administration have devoted\r\nmuch of their energy to attempts at personal onslaughts. This line\r\nof action has called forth the comment that it is because of the\r\nvery absence of administrative scandals that the administration’s\r\nadversaries resort to vague personal attacks. From these opponents has\r\ncome the persistent innuendo that because of Mayor Mitchel’s occasional\r\nsocial associations with rich and powerful personages, his official\r\nactivities must necessarily be influenced by that contact. It is aptly\r\npointed out that the hypocrisy and demagogery of such an aspersion may\r\nbe properly estimated when it is recalled that the elements mainly\r\nconcerned in spreading it have been the identical organized forces\r\nthat year after year were the tools of designing men and corporations\r\nthat by the adroit use of corrupt politics vested in themselves huge\r\ncorporate privileges and powers and enormous wealth.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Abolitionist movement, 122-123\r\n\r\n  Ackerman, Simon, 24\r\n\r\n  Adams, John, 5\r\n\r\n  Adams, John Quincy, 5, 61-65, 70-74, 82\r\n\r\n  Ætna Fire Insurance Co., 97\r\n\r\n  Ahearn, John F., 316, 324-326\r\n\r\n  Aldermanic corruption, 81, 98-99, 103, 105, 132-133, 155, 156, 167-171,\r\n      181, 197-198, 252, 263-265\r\n\r\n  Allds, Jotham P., 312\r\n\r\n  Allen, Stephen, 57, 60, 88, 89, 106\r\n\r\n  Alley, Saul, 106\r\n\r\n  Amory, William N., 293, 320-321, 332, 334-335\r\n\r\n  Andrews, Avery D., 279\r\n\r\n  Anti-Masonic party, 83, 87\r\n\r\n  Anti-Monopolists, 103, 109, 113-114, 119\r\n\r\n  Apollo Hall Democracy, 254\r\n\r\n  Arcularius, Philip I., 23\r\n\r\n  Astor, John Jacob, 232\r\n\r\n\r\n  B\r\n\r\n  Bailey, Benjamin, 88\r\n\r\n  Baker, Gardiner, 7\r\n\r\n  Baker, Ray Stannard, 321\r\n\r\n  Bank of America, 96, 126\r\n\r\n  Bank of the Metropolis, 64\r\n\r\n  Bank of the United States (see U.
