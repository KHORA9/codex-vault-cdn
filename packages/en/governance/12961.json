Long ere the grey\r\nwinter's morning struggled in through the crisp frosty air--long ere\r\nthe first gleam of the coming day dulled the glare of the flaming\r\ngas jets, the streets of the Lancashire capital were all astir with\r\nbustling crowds, and the silence of the night was broken by the\r\nceaseless footfalls and the voices of hurrying throngs. Through the\r\nlong, dim streets, and past the tall rows of silent houses, the full\r\ntide of life eddied and poured in rapid current; stout burghers,\r\nclosely muffled and staff in hand; children grown prematurely old,\r\nwith the hard marks of vice already branded on their features; young\r\ngirls with flaunting ribbons and bold, flushed faces; pale-faced\r\noperatives, and strong men whose brawny limbs told of the Titanic\r\nlabours of the foundry; the clerk from his desk; the shopkeeper from\r\nhis store; the withered crone, and the careless navvy, swayed and\r\nstruggled through the living mass; and with them trooped the legions\r\nof want, and vice, and ignorance, that burrow and fester in the foetid\r\nlanes and purlieus of the large British cities: from the dark alleys\r\nwhere misery and degradation for ever dwell, and from reeking cellars\r\nand nameless haunts, where the twin demons of alcohol and crime rule\r\nsupreme; from the gin-palace, and the beer-shop, and the midnight\r\nhaunts of the tramp and the burglar, they came in all their\r\nrepulsiveness and debasement, with the rags of wretchedness upon\r\ntheir backs, and the cries of profanity and obscenity upon their\r\nlips. Forward they rushed in a surging flood through many a street\r\nand byway, until where the narrowing thoroughfares open into the space\r\nsurrounding the New Bailey Prison, in that suburb of the great city\r\nknown as the Borough of Salford, they found their further progress\r\narrested. Between them and the massive prison walls rose piles of\r\nheavy barricading, and the intervening space was black with a dense\r\nbody of men, all of whom faced the gloomy building beyond, and each of\r\nwhom carried a special constable's baton in his hand. The long railway\r\nbridge running close by was occupied by a detachment of infantry, and\r\nfrom the parapet of the frowning walls the muzzle of cannon, trained\r\non the space below, might be dimly discerned in the darkness. But\r\nthe crowd paid little attention to these extraordinary appearances;\r\ntheir eyes were riveted on the black projection which jutted from the\r\nprison wall, and which, shrouded in dark drapery, loomed with ghastly\r\nsignificance through the haze. Rising above the scaffold, which\r\nreplaced a portion of the prison wall, the outlines of a gibbet were\r\ndescried; and from the cross-beam there hung three ropes, terminating\r\nin nooses, just perceptible above the upper edge of the curtain which\r\nextended thence to the ground. The grim excrescence seemed to possess\r\na horrible fascination for the multitude. Those in position to see it\r\nbest stirred not from their post, but faced the fatal cross-tree, the\r\nmotionless ropes, the empty platform, with an untiring, insatiable\r\ngaze, that seemed pregnant with some terrible meaning, while the mob\r\nbehind them struggled, and pushed, and raved, and fought; and the\r\nhaggard hundreds of gaunt, diseased, stricken wretches, that vainly\r\ncontested with the stronger types of ruffianism for a place, loaded\r\nthe air with their blasphemies and imprecations. The day broke slowly\r\nand doubtfully upon the scene; a dense yellow, murky fog floated round\r\nthe spot, wrapping in its opaque folds the hideous gallows and the\r\nfrowning mass of masonry behind. An hour passed, and then a hoarse\r\nmurmur swelled upwards from the glistening rows of upturned faces.\r\nThe platform was no longer empty; three pinioned men, with white caps\r\ndrawn closely over their faces, were standing upon the drop. For a\r\nmoment the crowd was awed into stillness; for a moment the responses,\r\n\"Christ, have mercy on us,\" \"Christ, have mercy on us,\" were heard\r\nfrom the lips of the doomed men, towards whom the sea of faces were\r\nturned. Then came a dull crash, and the mob swayed backwards for an\r\ninstant. The drop had fallen, and the victims were struggling in\r\nthe throes of a horrible death. The ropes jerked and swayed with\r\nthe convulsive movements of the dying men. A minute later, and the\r\nvibrations ceased--the end had come, the swaying limbs fell rigid\r\nand stark, and the souls of the strangled men had floated upwards\r\nfrom the cursed spot--up from the hateful crowd and the sin-laden\r\natmosphere--to the throne of the God who made them.\r\n\r\nSo perished, in the bloom of manhood, and the flower of their\r\nstrength, three gallant sons of Ireland--so passed away the last\r\nof the martyred band whose blood has sanctified the cause of Irish\r\nfreedom. Far from the friends whom they loved, far from the land for\r\nwhich they suffered, with the scarlet-clad hirelings of England around\r\nthem, and watched by the wolfish eyes of a brutal mob, who thirsted\r\nto see them die, the dauntless patriots, who, in our own day,\r\nhave rivalled the heroism and shared the fate of Tone, Emmett, and\r\nFitzgerald, looked their last upon the world. No prayer was breathed\r\nfor their parting souls--no eye was moistened with regret amongst the\r\nmultitude that stretched away in compact bodies from the foot of the\r\ngallows; the ribald laugh and the blasphemous oath united with their\r\ndying breath; and, callously as the Roman mob from the blood-stained\r\namphitheatre, the English masses turned homewards from the fatal spot.\r\nBut they did not fall unhonoured or unwept. In the churches of the\r\nfaithful in that same city, the sobs of mournful lamentation were\r\nmingled with the solemn prayers for their eternal rest, and, from\r\nthousands of wailing women and stricken-hearted men, the prayers for\r\nmercy, peace, and pardon, for the souls of MICHAEL O'BRIEN, WILLIAM\r\nPHILIP ALLEN, and MICHAEL LARKIN, rose upwards to the avenging God.\r\nStill less were they forgotten at home. Throughout the Irish land,\r\nfrom Antrim's rocky coast to the foam-beaten headlands of Cork, the\r\nhearts of their countrymen were convulsed with passionate grief and\r\nindignation, and, blended with the sharp cry of agony that broke from\r\nthe nation's lips, came the murmurs of defiant hatred, and the pledges\r\nof a bitter vengeance. Never, for generations, had the minds of the\r\nIrish people been more profoundly agitated--never had they writhed\r\nin such bitterness and agony of soul. With knitted brows and burning\r\ncheeks, the tidings of the bloody deed were listened to. The names of\r\nthe martyred men were upon every lip, and the story of their heroism\r\nand tragic death was read with throbbing pulse and kindling eyes\r\nby every fireside in the land. It is to assist in perpetuating that\r\nstory, and in recording for future generations the narrative which\r\ntells of how Allen, O'Brien, and Larkin died, that this narrative is\r\nwritten, and few outside the nation whose hands are red with their\r\nblood, will deny that at least so much recognition is due to their\r\ncourage, their patriotism, and their fidelity. In Ireland we know it\r\nwill be welcomed; amongst a people by whom chivalry and patriotism are\r\nhonoured, a story so touching and so enobling will not be despised;\r\nand the race which guards with reverence and devotion the memories\r\nof Tone, and Emmett, and the Shearses, will not soon surrender to\r\noblivion the memory of the three true-hearted patriots, who, heedless\r\nof the scowling mob, unawed by the hangman's grasp, died bravely that\r\nSaturday morning at Manchester, for the good old cause of Ireland.\r\n\r\nEarly before daybreak on the morning of November 11th, 1867,\r\nthe policemen on duty in Oak-street, Manchester, noticed four\r\nbroad-shouldered, muscular men loitering in a suspicious manner\r\nabout the shop of a clothes dealer in the neighbourhood. Some remarks\r\ndropped by one of the party reaching the ears of the policemen,\r\nstrengthened their impression that an illegal enterprise was on foot,\r\nand the arrest of the supposed burglars was resolved on. A struggle\r\nensued, during which two of the suspects succeeded in escaping, but\r\nthe remaining pair, after offering a determined resistance, were\r\noverpowered and carried off to the police station. The prisoners, who,\r\non being searched, were found to possess loaded revolvers on their\r\npersons, gave their names as Martin Williams and John Whyte, and were\r\ncharged under the Vagrancy Act before one of the city magistrates.\r\nThey declared themselves American citizens, and claimed their\r\ndischarge. Williams said he was a bookbinder out of work; Whyte\r\ndescribed himself as a hatter, living on the means brought with him\r\nfrom America. The magistrate was about disposing summarily of the\r\ncase, by sentencing the men to a few days' imprisonment, when a\r\ndetective officer applied for a remand, on the ground that he had\r\nreason to believe the prisoners were connected with the Fenian\r\nconspiracy. The application was granted, and before many hours\r\nhad elapsed it was ascertained that Martin Williams was no other\r\nthan Colonel Thomas J. Kelly, one of the most prominent of the\r\n(O'Mahony-Stephens) Fenian leaders, and that John Whyte was a brother\r\nofficer and co-conspirator, known to the circles of the Fenian\r\nBrotherhood as Captain Deasey.\r\n\r\nOf the men who had thus fallen into the clutches of the British\r\ngovernment the public had already heard much, and one of them\r\nwas widely known for the persistency with which he laboured as an\r\norganiser of Fenianism, and the daring and skill which he exhibited\r\nin the pursuit of his dangerous undertaking. Long before the escape\r\nof James Stephens from Richmond Bridewell startled the government from\r\nits visions of security, and swelled the breasts of their disaffected\r\nsubjects in Ireland with rekindled hopes, Colonel Kelly was known in\r\nthe Fenian ranks as an intimate associate of the revolutionary chief.\r\nWhen the arrest at Fairfield-house deprived the organization of its\r\ncrafty leader, Kelly was elected to the vacant post, and he threw\r\nhimself into the work with all the reckless energy of his nature. If\r\nhe could not be said to possess the mental ability or administrative\r\ncapacity essential to the office, he was at least gifted with a\r\nvariety of other qualifications well calculated to recommend him to\r\npopularity amongst the desperate men with whom he was associated. Nor\r\ndid he prove altogether unworthy of the confidence reposed in him. It\r\nis now pretty well known that the successful plot for the liberation\r\nof James Stephens was executed under the personal supervision of\r\nColonel Kelly, and that he was one of the group of friends who grasped\r\nthe hand of the Head Centre within the gates of Eichmond Prison on\r\nthat night in November, '65, when the doors of his dungeon were thrown\r\nopen. Kelly fled with Stephens to Paris, and thence to America,\r\nwhere he remained attached to the section of the Brotherhood which\r\nrecognised the authority and obeyed the mandates of the \"C.O.I.R.\" But\r\nthe time came when even Colonel Kelly and his party discovered that\r\nStephens was unworthy of their confidence. The chief whom they had so\r\nlong trusted, and whose oath to fight on Irish soil before January,\r\n'67, they had seen so unblushingly violated, was deposed by the\r\nlast section of his adherents, and Colonel Kelly was elected\r\n\"Deputy Central Organiser of the Irish Republic,\" on the distinct\r\nunderstanding that he was to follow out the policy which Stephens had\r\nshrunk from pursuing. Kelly accepted the post, and devoted himself\r\nearnestly to the work. In America he met with comparatively little\r\nco-operation; the bulk of the Irish Nationalists in that country had\r\nlong ranged themselves under the leadership of Colonel W.R. Roberts,\r\nan Irish gentleman of character and integrity, who became the\r\nPresident of the reconstituted organization; and the plans and\r\npromises of \"the Chatham-street wing,\" as the branch of the\r\nbrotherhood which ratified Colonel Kelly's election was termed,\r\nwere regarded, for the most part, with suspicion and disfavour. But\r\nfrom Ireland there came evidences of a different state of feeling.\r\nBreathless envoys arrived almost weekly in New York, declaring that\r\nthe Fenian Brotherhood in Ireland were burning for the fray--that they\r\nawaited the landing of Colonel Kelly with feverish impatience--that\r\nit would be impossible to restrain them much longer from fighting--and\r\nthat the arrival of the military leaders, whom America was expected\r\nto supply, would be the signal for a general uprising. Encouraged\r\nby representations like these, Colonel Kelly and a chosen body of\r\nIrish-American officers departed for Ireland in January, and set\r\nthemselves, on their arrival in the old country, to arrange the plans\r\nof the impending outbreak. How their labours eventuated, and how the\r\nFenian insurrection of March, '67, resulted, it is unnecessary to\r\nexplain; it is enough for our purpose to state that for several months\r\nafter that ill-starred movement was crushed, Colonel Kelly continued\r\nto reside in Dublin, moving about with an absence of disguise and\r\na disregard for concealment which astonished his confederates, but\r\nwhich, perhaps, contributed in no slight degree to the success with\r\nwhich he eluded the efforts directed towards his capture. At length\r\nthe Fenian organization in Ireland began to pass through the same\r\nchanges that had given it new leaders and fresh vitality in America.\r\nThe members of the organization at home began to long for union\r\nwith the Irish Nationalists who formed the branch of the confederacy\r\nregenerated under Colonel Roberts; and Kelly, who, for various\r\nreasons, was unwilling to accept the new _regime_, saw his adherents\r\ndwindle away, until at length he found himself all but discarded by\r\nthe Fenian circles in Dublin. Then he crossed over to Manchester,\r\nwhere he arrived but a few weeks previous to the date of his\r\naccidental arrest in Oak-street.\r\n\r\nThe arrest of Colonel Kelly and his aide-de-camp, as the English\r\npapers soon learned to describe Deasey, was hailed by the government\r\nwith the deepest satisfaction. For years they had seen their hosts of\r\nspies, detectives, and informers foiled and outwitted by this daring\r\nconspirator, whose position in the Fenian ranks they perfectly\r\nunderstood; they had seen their traps evaded, their bribes spurned,\r\nand their plans defeated at every turn; they knew, too, that Kelly's\r\nsuccess in escaping capture was filling his associates with pride and\r\nexultation; and now at last they found the man whose apprehension they\r\nso anxiously desired a captive in their grasp. On the other hand, the\r\narrests in Oak-street were felt to be a crushing blow to a failing\r\ncause by the Fenian circles in Manchester. They saw that Kelly's\r\ncapture would dishearten every section of the organization; they knew\r\nthat the broad meaning of the occurrence was, that another Irish rebel\r\nhad fallen into the clutches of the British government, and was about\r\nto be added to the long list of their political victims. It was felt\r\nby the Irish in Manchester, that to abandon the prisoners helplessly\r\nto their fate would be regarded as an act of submission to the laws\r\nwhich rendered patriotism a crime, and as an acceptance of the policy\r\nwhich left Ireland trampled, bleeding, and impoverished. There\r\nwere hot spirits amongst the Irish colony that dwelt in the great\r\nindustrial capital, which revolted from such a conclusion, and there\r\nwere warm, impulsive hearts which swelled with a firm resolution to\r\nchange the triumph of their British adversaries into disappointment\r\nand consternation. The time has not yet come when anything like\r\na description of the midnight meetings and secret councils which\r\nfollowed the arrest of Colonel Kelly in Manchester can be written;\r\nenough may be gathered, however, from the result, to show that the\r\nplans of the conspirators were cleverly conceived and ably digested.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, September 18th, Colonel Kelly and his companion were\r\na second time placed in the dock of the Manchester Police Office.\r\nThere is reason to believe that means had previously been found of\r\nacquainting them with the plans of their friends outside, but this\r\nhypothesis is not necessary to explain the coolness and _sang froid_\r\nwith which they listened to the proceedings before the magistrate.\r\nHardly had the prisoners been put forward, when the Chief Inspector\r\nof the Manchester Detective Force interposed. They were both, he said,\r\nconnected with the Fenian rising, and warrants were out against them\r\nfor treason-felony. \"Williams,\" he added, with a triumphant air, \"is\r\nColonel Kelly, and Whyte, his confederate, is Captain Deasey.\" He\r\nasked that they might again be remanded, an application which was\r\nimmediately granted. The prisoners, who imperturbably bowed to the\r\ndetective, as he identified them, smilingly quitted the dock, and were\r\ngiven in charge to Police Sergeant Charles Brett, whose duty it was to\r\nconvey them to the borough gaol.\r\n\r\nThe van used for the conveyance of prisoners between the police office\r\nand the gaol was one of the ordinary long black boxes on wheels, dimly\r\nlit by a grating in the door and a couple of ventilators in the roof.\r\nIt was divided interiorly into a row of small cells at either side,\r\nand a passage running the length of the van between; and the practice\r\nwas, to lock each prisoner into a separate cell, Brett sitting in\r\ncharge on a seat in the passage, near the door. The van was driven\r\nby a policeman; another usually sat beside the driver on the box; the\r\nwhole escort thus consisting of three men, carrying no other arms than\r\ntheir staves; but it was felt that on the present occasion a stronger\r\nescort might be necessary. The magistrates well knew that Kelly\r\nand Deasey had numerous sympathisers amongst the Irish residents in\r\nManchester, and their apprehensions were quickened by the receipt of\r\na telegram from Dublin Castle, and another from the Home Office in\r\nLondon, warning them that a plot was on foot for the liberation of the\r\nprisoners. The magistrates doubted the truth of the information, but\r\nthey took precautions, nevertheless, for the frustration of any such\r\nenterprise. Kelly and Deasey were both handcuffed, and locked in\r\nseparate compartments of the van; and, instead of three policemen,\r\nnot less than twelve were entrusted with its defence. Of this body,\r\nfive sat on the box-seat, two were stationed on the step behind, four\r\nfollowed the van in a cab, and one (Sergeant Brett) sat within the\r\nvan, the keys of which were handed in to him through the grating,\r\nafter the door had been locked by one of the policemen outside. There\r\nwere, in all, six persons in the van: one of these was a boy, aged\r\ntwelve, who was being conveyed to a reformatory; three were women\r\nconvicted of misdemeanours; and the two Irish-Americans completed the\r\nnumber. Only the last-mentioned pair were handcuffed, and they were\r\nthe only persons whom the constables thought necessary to lock up, the\r\ncompartments in which the other persons sat being left open.\r\n\r\nAt half-past three o'clock the van drove off, closely followed by the\r\ncab containing the balance of the escort. Its route lay through some\r\nof the principal streets, then through the suburbs on the south side,\r\ninto the borough of Salford, where the county gaol is situated. In all\r\nabout two miles had to be traversed, and of this distance the first\r\nhalf was accomplished without anything calculated to excite suspicion\r\nbeing observed; but there was mischief brewing, for all that, and the\r\ncrisis was close at hand. Just as the van passed under the railway\r\narch that spans the Hyde-road at Bellevue, a point midway between\r\nthe city police office and the Salford gaol, the driver was suddenly\r\nstartled by the apparition of a man standing in the middle of the\r\nroad with a pistol aimed at his head, and immediately the astonished\r\npoliceman heard himself called upon, in a loud, sharp voice, to \"pull\r\nup.\" At the spot where this unwelcome interruption occurred there\r\nare but few houses; brick-fields and clay-pits stretch away at either\r\nside, and the neighbourhood is thinly inhabited. But its comparative\r\nquiet now gave way to a scene of bustle and excitement so strange\r\nthat it seems to have almost paralysed the spectators with amazement.\r\nThe peremptory command levelled at the driver of the van was hardly\r\nuttered, when a body of men, numbering about thirty, swarmed over\r\nthe wall which lined the road, and, surrounding the van, began to\r\ntake effectual measures for stopping it. The majority of them were\r\nwell-dressed men, of powerful appearance; a few carried pistols or\r\nrevolvers in their hands, and all seemed to act in accordance with a\r\npreconcerted plan. The first impulse of the policemen in front appears\r\nto have been to drive through the crowd, but a shot, aimed in the\r\ndirection of his head brought the driver tumbling from his seat,\r\nterror-stricken but unhurt; and almost at the same time, the further\r\nprogress of the van was effectually prevented by shooting one of the\r\nhorses through the neck. A scene of indescribable panic and confusion\r\nensued; the policemen scrambled hastily to the ground, and betook\r\nthemselves to flight almost without a thought of resistance. Those\r\nin the cab behind got out, not to resist the attack, but to help in\r\nrunning away; and in a few minutes the strangers, whose object had by\r\nthis time become perfectly apparent, were undisputed masters of the\r\nsituation. Pickaxes, hatchets, hammers, and crow-bars were instantly\r\nproduced, and the van was besieged by a score stout pairs of arms,\r\nunder the blows from which its sides groaned, and the door cracked and\r\nsplintered. Some clambered upon the roof, and attempted to smash it in\r\nwith heavy stones; others tried to force an opening through the side;\r\nwhile the door was sturdily belaboured by another division of the\r\nband. Seeing the Fenians, as they at once considered them, thus busily\r\nengaged, the policemen, who had in the first instance retreated to a\r\nsafe distance, and who were now reinforced by a large mob attracted\r\nto the spot by the report of firearms, advanced towards the van, with\r\nthe intention of offering some resistance; but the storming party\r\nimmediately met them with a counter-movement. Whilst the attempt to\r\nsmash through the van was continued without pause, a ring was formed\r\nround the men thus engaged, by their confederates, who, pointing\r\ntheir pistols at the advancing crowd, warned them, as they valued\r\ntheir lives, to keep off. Gaining courage from their rapidly-swelling\r\nnumbers, the mob, however, continued to close in round the van,\r\nwhereupon several shots were discharged by the Fenians, which had the\r\neffect of making the Englishmen again fall back in confusion. It is\r\ncertain that these shots were discharged for no other purpose than\r\nthat of frightening the crowd; one of them did take effect in the heel\r\nof a bystander, but in every other case the shots were fired high over\r\nthe heads of the crowd. While this had been passing around the van, a\r\nmore tragic scene was passing inside it. From the moment the report\r\nof the first shot reached him, Sergeant Brett seems to have divined\r\nthe nature and object of the attack. \"My God! its these Fenians,\" he\r\nexclaimed. The noise of the blows showered on the roof and sides of\r\nthe van was increased by the shrieks of the female prisoners, who\r\nrushed frantically into the passage, and made the van resound with\r\ntheir wailings. In the midst of the tumult a face appeared at the\r\ngrating, and Brett heard himself summoned to give up the keys. The\r\nassailants had discovered where they were kept, and resolved on\r\nobtaining them as the speediest way of effecting their purpose. \"Give\r\nup the keys, or they will shoot you,\" exclaimed the women; but Brett\r\nrefused. The next instant he fell heavily backwards, with the hot\r\nblood welling from a bullet-wound in the head. A shot fired into the\r\nkey-hole, for the purpose of blowing the lock to pieces, had taken\r\neffect in his temple. The terror-stricken women lifted him up,\r\nscreaming \"he's killed.\" As they did so, the voice which had been\r\nheard before called out to them through the ventilator to give up the\r\nkeys. One of the women then took them from the pocket of the dying\r\npoliceman, and handed them out through the trap. The door was at once\r\nunlocked, the terrified women rushed out, and Brett, weltering in\r\nblood, rolled out heavily upon the road. Then a pale-faced young man,\r\nwearing a light overcoat, a blue tie, and a tall brown hat, who had\r\nbeen noticed taking a prominent part in the affray, entered the van,\r\nand unlocked the compartments in which Kelly and Deasey were confined.\r\nA hasty greeting passed between them, and then the trio hurriedly\r\njoined the band outside. \"I told you, Kelly, I would die before I\r\nparted with you,\" cried the young man who had unlocked the doors;\r\nthen, seizing Kelly by the arm, he helped him across the road, and\r\nover the wall, into the brick-fields beyond. Here he was taken charge\r\nof by others of the party, who hurried with him across the country,\r\nwhile a similar office was performed for Deasey, who, like Colonel\r\nKelly, found himself hampered to some extent by the handcuffs on his\r\nwrists. The main body of those who had shared in the assault occupied\r\nthemselves with preventing the fugitives from being pursued; and not\r\nuntil Kelly, Deasy, and their conductors had passed far out of sight,\r\ndid they think of consulting their own safety. At length, when further\r\nresistance to the mob seemed useless and impossible, they broke and\r\nfled, some of them occasionally checking the pursuit by turning round\r\nand presenting pistols at those who followed. Many of the fugitives\r\nescaped, but several others were surrounded and overtaken by the mob.\r\nAnd now the \"chivalry\" of the English nature came out in its real\r\ncolours. No sooner did the cowardly set, whom the sight of a revolver\r\nkept at bay while Kelly was being liberated, find themselves with some\r\nof the Irish party in their power, than they set themselves to beat\r\nthem with savage ferocity. The young fellow who had opened the van\r\ndoor, and who had been overtaken by the mob, was knocked down by\r\na blow of a brick, and then brutally kicked and stoned, the only\r\nEnglishman who ventured to cry shame being himself assaulted for his\r\ndisplay of humanity. Several others were similarly ill-treated; and\r\nnot until the blood spouted out from the bruised and mangled bodies\r\nof the prostrate men, did the valiant Englishmen consider they had\r\nsufficiently tortured their helpless prisoners. Meanwhile, large\r\nreinforcements appeared on the spot; police and military were\r\ndespatched in eager haste in pursuit of the fugitives; the telegraph\r\nwas called into requisition, and a description of the liberated\r\nFenians flashed to the neighbouring towns; the whole detective force\r\nof Manchester was placed on their trail, and in the course of a\r\nfew hours thirty-two Irishmen were in custody, charged with having\r\nassisted in the attack on the van. But of Kelly or Deasey no trace was\r\never discovered; they were seen to enter a cottage not far from the\r\nHyde-road, and leave it with their hands unfettered, but all attempts\r\nto trace their movements beyond this utterly failed. While the\r\nauthorities in Manchester were excitedly discussing the means to\r\nbe adopted in view of the extraordinary event, Brett lay expiring\r\nin the hospital to which he had been conveyed. He never recovered\r\nconsciousness after receiving the wound, and he died in less than two\r\nhours after the fatal shot had been fired.\r\n\r\nDarkness had closed in around Manchester before the startling\r\noccurrence that had taken place in their midst became known to the\r\nmajority of its inhabitants. Swiftly the tidings flew throughout the\r\nbig city, till the whisper in which the rumour was first breathed\r\nswelled into a roar of astonishment and rage. Leaving their houses and\r\nleaving their work, the people rushed into the streets, and trooped\r\ntowards the newspaper offices for information. The rescue of Colonel\r\nKelly and death of Sergeant Brett were described in thousands of\r\nconflicting narratives, until the facts almost disappeared beneath\r\nthe mass of inventions and exaggerations, the creations of excitement\r\nand panic, with which they were overloaded. Meanwhile, the police,\r\nmaddened by resentment and agitation, struck out wildly and blindly\r\nat the Irish. They might not be able to recapture the escaped Fenian\r\nleaders, but they could load the gaols with their countrymen and\r\nco-religionists; they might not be able to apprehend the liberators\r\nof Colonel Kelly and Captain Deasey, but they could glut their fury on\r\nmembers of the same nationality; and this they did most effectually.\r\nThe whole night long the raid upon the Irish quarter in Manchester was\r\ncontinued; houses were broken into, and their occupants dragged off\r\nto prison, and flung into cells, chained as though they were raging\r\nbeasts. Mere Irish were set upon in the streets, in the shops, in\r\ntheir homes, and hurried off to prison as if the very existence of\r\nthe empire depended on their being subjected to every kind of brutal\r\nviolence and indignity. The yell for vengeance filled the air; the cry\r\nfor Irish blood arose upon the night-air like a demoniacal chorus;\r\nand before morning broke their fury was to some extent appeased by\r\nthe knowledge that sixty of the proscribed race--sixty of the hated\r\nIrish--were lying chained within the prison cells of Manchester.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes was the time occupied in setting Kelly free--only\r\nfifteen minutes--but during that short space of time an act was\r\naccomplished which shook the whole British Empire to its foundation.\r\nFrom the conspiracy to which this daring deed was traceable the\r\nEnglish people had already received many startling surprises. The\r\nliberation of James Stephens and the short-lived insurrection that\r\nfilled the snow-capped hills with hardy fugitives, six months before,\r\nhad both occasioned deep excitement in England; but nothing that\r\nFenianism had yet accomplished acted in the same bewildering manner\r\non the English mind. In the heart of one of their largest cities, in\r\nthe broad daylight, openly and undisguisedly, a band of Irishmen had\r\nappeared in arms against the Queen's authority, and set the power and\r\nresources of the law at defiance. They had rescued a co-conspirator\r\nfrom the grasp of the government, and slain an officer of the law in\r\nthe pursuit of their object. Within a few minutes' walk of barracks\r\nand military depôts,--in sight of the royal ensign that waved over\r\nhundreds of her Majesty's defenders, a prison van had been stopped and\r\nbroken open, and its defenders shot at and put to flight. Never had\r\nthe English people heard of so audacious a proceeding--never did they\r\nfeel more insulted. From every corner of the land the cry swelled, up\r\nfor vengeance fierce and prompt. Victims there should be; blood--Irish\r\nblood--the people _would_ have; nor were they willing to wait long for\r\nit. It might be that, falling in hot haste, the sword of Justice might\r\nstrike the innocent, and not the guilty; it might be that, in the\r\nthirst for vengeance, the restraints of humanity would be forgotten;\r\nbut the English nature, now thoroughly aroused, cared little for such\r\nconsiderations. It was Irishmen who had defied and trampled on their\r\npower; the whole Irish people approved of the act; and it mattered\r\nlittle who the objects of their fury might be, provided they\r\nbelonged to the detested race. The prisoners, huddled together in the\r\nManchester prisons, with chains round their limbs, might not be the\r\nliberators of Colonel Kelly--the slayers of Brett might not be amongst\r\nthem; but they were Irishmen, at any rate, and so they would answer\r\nthe purpose. Short shrift was the cry. The ordinary forms of law,\r\nthe maxims of the Constitution, the rules of judicial procedure, the\r\nproprieties of social order and civilization, might be outraged and\r\ndiscarded, but speedy vengeance should, at all hazards, be obtained:\r\nthe hangman could not wait for his fee, nor the people for their\r\ncarnival of blood; and so it was settled that, instead of being tried\r\nat the ordinary Commission, in December, a Special Commission should\r\nbe issued on the spot for the trial of the accused.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, the 25th of October, the prisoners were brought up\r\nfor committal, before Mr. Fowler, R.M., and a bench of brother\r\nmagistrates. Some of the Irishmen arrested in the first instance had\r\nbeen discharged--not that no one could be found to swear against them\r\n(a difficulty which never seems to have arisen in these cases) but\r\nthat the number of witnesses who could swear to their innocence was so\r\ngreat, that an attempt to press for convictions in their cases would\r\nbe pertain to jeopardize the whole proceedings. The following is a\r\nlist of the prisoners put forward, the names being, as afterwards\r\nappeared, in many cases fictitious:--\r\n\r\n    William O'Mara Allen, Edward Shore, Henry Wilson, William\r\n    Gould, Michael Larkin, Patrick Kelly, Charles Moorhouse, John\r\n    Brennan, John Bacon, William Martin, John F. Nugent, James\r\n    Sherry, Robert McWilliams, Michael Maguire, Thomas Maguire,\r\n    Michael Morris, Michael Bryan, Michael Corcoran, Thomas Ryan,\r\n    John Carroll, John Cleeson, Michael Kennedy, John Morris,\r\n    Patrick Kelly, Hugh Foley, Patrick Coffey, Thomas Kelly, and\r\n    Thomas Scally.\r\n\r\nIt forms no part of our purpose to follow out the history of the\r\nproceedings in the Manchester court on the 25th of September and the\r\nfollowing days: but there are some circumstances in connection with\r\nthat investigation which it would be impossible to pass over without\r\ncomment. It was on this occasion that the extraordinary sight of men\r\nbeing tried in chains was witnessed, and that the representatives of\r\nthe English Crown came to sit in judgment on men still innocent in\r\nthe eyes of the law, yet manacled like convicted felons. With the\r\nblistering irons clasped tight round their wrists the Irish prisoners\r\nstood forward, that justice--such justice as tortures men first and\r\ntries them afterwards--might be administered to them. \"The police\r\nconsidered the precaution necessary,\" urged the magistrate, in reply\r\nto the scathing denunciations of the unprecedented outrage which fell\r\nfrom the lips of Mr. Ernest Jones, one of the prisoners' counsel. The\r\npolice considered it necessary, though within the courthouse no friend\r\nof the accused could dare to show his face--though the whole building\r\nbristled with military and with policemen, with their revolvers\r\nostentatiously displayed;--necessary, though every approach to the\r\ncourthouse was held by an armed guard, and though every soldier in the\r\nwhole city was standing to arms;--necessary there, in the heart of an\r\nEnglish city, with a dense population thirsting for the blood of the\r\naccused, and when the danger seemed to be, not that they might escape\r\nfrom custody--a flight to the moon would be equally practicable--but\r\nthat they might be butchered in cold blood by the angry English mob\r\nthat scowled on them from the galleries of the court house, and howled\r\nround the building in which they stood. In vain did Mr. Jones protest,\r\nin scornful words, against the brutal indignity--in vain did he appeal\r\nto the spirit of British justice, to ancient precedent and modern\r\npractice--in vain did he inveigh against a proceeding which forbad\r\nthe intercourse necessary between him and his clients--and in vain\r\ndid he point out that the prisoners in the dock were guiltless and\r\ninnocent men according to the theory of the law. No arguments, no\r\nexpostulations would change the magistrate's decision. Amidst the\r\napplause of the cowardly set that represented the British public\r\nwithin the courthouse, he insisted that the handcuffs should remain\r\non; and then Mr. Jones, taking the only course left to a man of spirit\r\nunder the circumstances, threw down his brief and indignantly quitted\r\nthe desecrated justice hall. Fearing the consequences of leaving the\r\nprisoners utterly undefended, Mr. Cottingham, the junior counsel for\r\nthe defence, refrained from following Mr. Jones's example, but he,\r\ntoo, protested loudly, boldly, and indignantly against the cowardly\r\noutrage, worthy of the worst days of the French monarchy, which\r\nhis clients were being subjected to. The whole investigation was in\r\nkeeping with the spirit evinced by the bench. The witnesses seemed\r\nto come for the special purpose of swearing point-blank against the\r\nhapless men in the dock, no matter at what cost to truth, and to take\r\na fiendish pleasure in assisting in securing their condemnation. One\r\nof the witnesses was sure \"the whole lot of them wanted to murder\r\neveryone who had any property;\" another assured his interrogator in\r\nthe dock that \"he would go to see him hanged;\" and a third had no\r\nhesitation in acknowledging the attractions which the reward offered\r\nby the government possessed for his mind. Men and women, young and\r\nold, all seemed to be possessed of but the one idea--to secure as\r\nmuch of the blood-money as possible, and to do their best to bring the\r\nhated Irish to the gallows. Of course, an investigation, under these\r\ncircumstances, could have but one ending, and no one was surprised\r\nto learn, at its conclusion, that the whole of the resolute body\r\nof stern-faced men, who, manacled and suffering, confronted their\r\nmalignant accusers, had been committed to stand their trial in hot\r\nhaste, for the crime of \"wilful murder.\"\r\n\r\nOf the men thus dealt with there are four with whose fate this\r\nnarrative is closely connected, and whose names are destined to be\r\nlong remembered in Ireland. They have won for themselves, by their\r\ncourage, constancy, and patriotism, a fame that will never die; and\r\nthrough all future time they will rank beside the dauntless spirits\r\nthat in days of darkness and disaster perished for the sacred cause\r\nof Ireland. Great men, learned men, prominent men they were not--they\r\nwere poor, they were humble, they were unknown; they had no claim to\r\nthe reputation of the warrior, the scholar, or the statesman; but they\r\nlaboured, as they believed, for the redemption of their country from\r\nbondage; they risked their lives in a chivalrous attempt to rescue\r\nfrom captivity two men whom they regarded as innocent patriots, and\r\nwhen the forfeit was claimed, they bore themselves with the unwavering\r\ncourage and single-heartedness of Christian heroes. Their short and\r\nsimple annals are easily written, but their names are graven on the\r\nIrish heart, and their names and actions will be cherished in Ireland\r\nwhen the monumental piles that mark the resting-places of the wealthy\r\nand the proud have returned, like the bodies laid beneath them, to\r\ndust.\r\n\r\nWilliam Philip Allen was born near the town of Tipperary, in April,\r\n1848. Before he was quite three years old his parents removed to\r\nBandon, County Cork, where the father, who professed the Protestant\r\nreligion, received the appointment of bridewell-keeper. As young\r\nAllen grew up, he evinced a remarkable aptitude for the acquirement\r\nof knowledge, and his studious habits were well known to his\r\nplaymates and companions. He was a regular attendant at the local\r\ntraining-school for the education of teachers for the Protestant\r\nschools of the parish, but he also received instruction at the morning\r\nand evening schools conducted under Catholic auspices, in the same\r\ntown. He was not a wild boy, but he was quick and impulsive,--ready\r\nto resent a wrong, but equally ready to forgive one; and his natural\r\nindependence of spirit and manly disposition rendered him a favourite\r\nwith all his acquaintances. The influence and example of his father\r\ndid not prevent him from casting a wistful eye towards the ancient\r\nfaith. His mother, a good pious Catholic, whose warmest aspiration was\r\nto see her children in the fold of the true church, encouraged this\r\ndisposition by all the means in her power, and the result of her pious\r\ncare shortly became apparent. A mission, opened in the town by some\r\nCatholic order of priests, completed the good work, which the prayers\r\nand the example of an affectionate mother had commenced; and young\r\nAllen, after regularly attending the religious services and exercises\r\nof the mission, became so much Impressed with the truth of the\r\nlectures and sermons he had listened to, that he formally renounced\r\nthe alien religion, and was received by the respected parish priest\r\nof the town into the bosom of the Catholic Church. His only sister\r\nfollowed his example, while his brothers, four in number, remained in\r\nthe Protestant communion. The subject of our sketch was apprenticed\r\nto a respectable master carpenter and timber merchant in Bandon,\r\nbut circumstances highly creditable to the young convert induced the\r\nseverance of the connection before his period of apprenticeship was\r\nexpired, and we next find him working at his trade in Cork, where he\r\nremained for some six months, after which he returned to Bandon. He\r\nnext crossed over to Manchester, at the request of some near relatives\r\nliving there. Subsequently he spent a few weeks in Dublin, where he\r\nworked as builder's clerk; and finally he revisited Manchester, where\r\nhe had made himself numerous friends. It was in the summer of '67\r\nthat Allen last journeyed to Manchester. He was then little more than\r\nnineteen years old, but there is reason to believe that he had long\r\nbefore become connected with the Fenian conspiracy. In his ardent\r\ntemperament the seeds of patriotism took deep and firm root, and the\r\ndangers of the enterprise to which the Fenians were committed served\r\nonly to give it a fresh claim upon his enthusiastic nature. When\r\nColonel Kelly quitted Dublin, and took up his quarters in Manchester,\r\nAllen was one of his most trusted and intimate associates; and when\r\nthe prison door grated behind the Fenian leader, it was Allen who\r\nroused his countrymen to the task of effecting his liberation. Allen\r\nhad by this time grown into a comely young man of prepossessing\r\nappearance; he was a little over the middle height, well shaped,\r\nwithout presenting the appearance of unusual strength, and was always\r\nseen neatly and respectably dressed. His face was pale, and wore\r\na thoughtful expression, his features, when in repose, wearing an\r\nappearance of pensiveness approaching to melancholy. His eyes were\r\nsmall, the eyelids slightly marked; a mass of dark hair clustered\r\ngracefully over a broad pale forehead, while the absence of any beard\r\ngave him a peculiarly boyish appearance. Gentle and docile in his\r\ncalmer moments, when roused to action he was all fire and energy. We\r\nhave seen how he bore himself during the attack on the prison van, for\r\nhe it was whom so many witnesses identified as the pale-faced young\r\nfellow who led the attack, and whose prophetic assurance that he would\r\ndie for him, greeted Colonel Kelly on regaining his freedom. During\r\nthe magisterial investigation he bore himself firmly, proudly, and, as\r\nthe English papers would have it, defiantly. His glance never quailed\r\nduring the trying ordeal. The marks of the brutality of his cowardly\r\ncaptors were still upon him, and the galling irons that bound his\r\nhands cut into his wrists; but Allen never winced for a moment, and\r\nhe listened to the evidence of the sordid crew, who came to barter\r\naway his young life, with resolute mien. The triumph was with him.\r\nOut of the jaws of death he had rescued the leader whose freedom he\r\nconsidered essential to the success of a patriotic undertaking, and he\r\nwas satisfied to pay the cost of the venture. He had set his foot upon\r\nthe ploughshare, and would not shrink from the ordeal which he had\r\nchallenged.\r\n\r\nAmongst the crowd of manacled men committed for trial by the\r\nManchester magistrates, not one presented a finer or more impressive\r\nexterior than Michael O'Brien, set down in the list above given as\r\nMichael Gould. Standing in the dock, he seemed the impersonation of\r\nvigorous manhood. Frank, fearless, and resolute, with courage and\r\ntruth imprinted on every feature, he presented to the eye a perfect\r\ntype of the brave soldier. He was tall and well-proportioned, and his\r\nbroad shoulders and well-developed limbs told of physical strength\r\nin keeping with the firmness reflected in his face. His gaze, when\r\nit rested on the unfriendly countenances before him, was firm and\r\nundrooping, but a kindly light lit his hazel eyes, and his features\r\nrelaxed into a sympathising and encouraging expression, as often as he\r\nglanced at Allen, who stood behind him, or bent his gaxe upon any of\r\nhis other fellow-prisoners. O'Brien was born, near Ballymacoda, County\r\nCork, the birthplace of the ill-fated and heroic Peter Crowley. His\r\nfather rented a large farm in the same parish, but the blight of the\r\nbad laws which are the curse of Ireland fell upon him, and in the year\r\n1856, the O'Briens were flung upon the world dispossessed of lands and\r\nhome, though they owed no man a penny at the time. Michael O'Brien was\r\napprenticed to a draper in Youghal, and earned, during the period of\r\nhis apprenticeship, the respect and esteem of all who knew him. He\r\nwas quiet and gentlemanly in manners, and his character for morality\r\nand good conduct was irreproachable. Having served out his time in\r\nYoughal, he went to Cork, and he spent some time as an assistant in\r\none of the leading drapery establishments of that city. He afterwards\r\nemigrated to America, where some of his relatives were comfortably\r\nsettled. Like many of the bravest of his fellow-countrymen, the\r\noutbreak of the civil war kindled a military ardour within his bosom,\r\nand O'Brien found himself unable to resist the attractions which the\r\nsoldier's career possessed for him. His record throughout the war\r\nwas highly honourable; his bravery and good conduct won him speedy\r\npromotion, and long before the termination of the conflict, he had\r\nrisen to the rank of lieutenant. When his regiment was disbanded he\r\nrecrossed the Atlantic, and returned to Cork, where he again obtained\r\nemployment as assistant in one of the large commercial establishments.\r\nHere he remained until the night before the Fenian rising, when he\r\nsuddenly disappeared, and all further trace was lost of him, until\r\narrested for participation in the attack upon the prison van in\r\nManchester.\r\n\r\nClose by his side in the dock stood Michael Larkin, an\r\nintelligent-looking man, older looking than most of his\r\nfellow-prisoners. The following are a few facts relating to his humble\r\nhistory:--\r\n\r\n\"He was,\" writes a correspondent who knew him, \"a native of the parish\r\nof Lusmagh, in the south-western corner of the King's County, where\r\nfor many generations his ancestors have been residents on the Cloghan\r\nCastle estate (then in the possession of the O'Moore family), and\r\nwhere several of his relatives still reside; and was grandson to James\r\nQuirke, a well-to-do farmer, who was flogged and transported in '98\r\nfor complicity in the rebellion of that time, and whose name, in this\r\npart of the country, is remembered with pleasure and affection for\r\nhis indomitable courage and perseverance in resisting the repeated\r\nallurements held out by the corrupt minions of the crown to induce him\r\nto become a traitor to his companions and his country. But all their\r\nimportunities were vain; Quirke steadily persevered in the principles\r\nof his gallant leader, Robert Emmett. Larkin's father was a\r\nrespectable tradesman, carrying on his business for many years in his\r\nnative parish; he removed to Parsonstown, where he contrived to impart\r\nto his son Michael, a good English education, and then taught him his\r\nown profession. When Michael had attained a thorough knowledge of his\r\nbusiness, he was employed till '58 at Parsonstown; he then went to\r\nEngland to improve his condition, and after some time he married, and\r\ncontinued to work on industriously at his business till May, '67, when\r\nhe visited his native country to receive the last benediction of his\r\ndying father. He again returned to England with his wife and family,\r\nto resume his employment. After some time he was arrested for\r\nassisting to release two of his fellow-countrymen from bondage. I\r\ncannot attempt to enumerate the many good qualities of the deceased\r\npatriot: the paternal affection, exhibited from the earliest age;\r\nthe mildness and affability of manner, good temper, affectionate and\r\ninoffensive disposition; his sobriety and good moral conduct--endeared\r\nhim to all who had the pleasure and honour of his acquaintance.\r\nThroughout his whole life he was remarkable for his 'love of country,'\r\nand expressions of sincere regret for the miserable condition of many\r\nof his countrymen were ever on his lips. He was, in the true sense\r\nof the idea, a good son, an affectionate husband and father, and a\r\nsincere friend.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday, October 28th, the three Irishmen whose lives we have\r\nglanced at were placed at the bar of the Manchester Assize Court,\r\nand formally placed on their trial for wilful murder. With them were\r\narraigned Thomas Maguire, a private belonging to the Royal Marines,\r\nwho was on furlough in Liverpool at the time of Kelly's liberation,\r\nand who was arrested merely because he happened to be an Irishman,\r\nand who, though perfectly innocent of the whole transaction, had\r\nbeen sworn against by numerous witnesses as a ringleader in the\r\nattack; and Edward O'Meagher Condon (_alias_ Shore), a fine-looking\r\nIrish-American, a citizen of the State of Ohio, against whom, like\r\nhis four companions, true bills had been found by the Grand Jury.\r\nIt would take long to describe the paroxysms of excitement, panic,\r\nand agitation that raged in the English mind within the period that\r\nintervened between the committal of the prisoners and the date at\r\nwhich we are now arrived. Nothing was heard of but the Fenians;\r\nnothing was talked of but the diabolical plots and murderous designs\r\nthey were said to be preparing. The Queen was to be shot at; Balmoral\r\nwas to be burned down; the armouries had been attacked; the barracks\r\nwere undermined; the gas works were to be exploded, the Bank blown\r\nup, the water poisoned. Nothing was too infernal or too wicked for the\r\nFenians, and every hour brought some addition to the monstrous stock\r\nof canards. North and south, east and west, the English people were in\r\na ferment of anxious alarm; and everywhere Fenianism was cursed as an\r\nunholy thing to be cut from society as an ulcerous sore--to be banned\r\nand loathed as a pestilence--a foul creation with murder in its glare,\r\nand the torch of the incendiary burning in its gory hand. Under these\r\ncircumstances, there was little chance that an unprejudiced jury could\r\nbe empanelled for the trial of the Irish prisoners; and their counsel,\r\nseeing the danger, sought to avent it by a motion for the postponement\r\nof the trials. The Home Secretary was memorialed on the subject,\r\nand the application was renewed before the judges in court, but the\r\nefforts to obtain justice were fruitless. The blood of the British\r\nlion was up; with bloodshot eyes and bristling mane he stood awaiting\r\nhis prey, and there was danger in trifling with his rage. Even Special\r\ncommissicns were voted slow, and a cry arose for martial law, Lynch\r\nlaw, or any law that would give the blood of the victims without\r\nhindrance or delay. So the appeal for time was spurned; the government\r\nwas deaf to all remonstrance; British bloodthirstiness carried the\r\nday, and the trials proceeded without interruption.\r\n\r\nWe have not patience to rehearse calmly the story of these trials,\r\nwhich will long remain the reproach of British lawyers. We shall not\r\nprobe the motives which led to the appointment of two such men as\r\nJustice Mellor and Justice Blackburne as Judges of the Commission,\r\nbut history will be at no loss to connect the selection with their\r\npeculiar character on the bench. Nor shall we analyze the speeches\r\nof the Attorney-General and his colleagues, in which the passions and\r\nprejudices of the jury were so dexterously appealed to. The character\r\nof the evidence demands more study. The witnesses consisted of the\r\npolicemen present at the attack, the prisoners who were locked with\r\nKelly and Deasey in the van, and the bystanders who saw the affray or\r\nassisted in stoning the prisoners before and after they were captured.\r\nThey swore with the utmost composure against the four prisoners. Allen\r\nwas identified as one of the leaders, and he it was whom most of the\r\nwitnesses declared to have fired through the door. On this point,\r\nindeed, as on many others, there was confusion and contradiction in\r\nthe evidence: some of the witnesses were sure it was O'Brien fired\r\nthrough the door; others were inclined to assign the leading part to\r\nCondon; but before the trial had gone far, it seemed to be understood\r\nthat Allen was the man to whom the death of Brett was to be\r\nattributed, and that the business of the witnesses was to connect\r\nthe other prisoners as closely as possible with his act. On one point\r\nnearly all of the witnesses were agreed--whoever there might be any\r\ndoubt about, there could be none concerning Maguire. Seven witnesses\r\nswore positively to having seen him assisting in breaking open the\r\nvan, and some of them even repeated the words which they said he\r\naddressed to them while thus engaged. On the evening of Friday,\r\nNovember 1st, the trials terminated. It was past five o'clock when\r\nJudge Mellor concluded his charge. The court was densely crowded, and\r\nevery eye was strained to mark the effect of the judge's words upon\r\nthe countenances of the prisoners; but they, poor fellows, quailed not\r\nas they heard the words which they knew would shortly be followed by\r\na verdict consigning them to the scaffold. Throughout the long trial\r\ntheir courage had never flagged, their spirits had never failed them\r\nfor an instant. Maguire, who had no real connection with the other\r\nfour, and who knew that the charge against him was a baseless\r\nconcoction, did, indeed, betray traces of anxiety and bewilderment\r\nas the trial progressed; but Allen, O'Brien, Larkin, and Condon went\r\nthrough the frightful ordeal with a heroic display of courage to which\r\neven the most malignant of their enemies have paid tribute.\r\n\r\nThe judge has done, and now the jury turned from the box \"to consider\r\ntheir verdict.\" An hour and twenty minutes they remained absent;\r\nthen their returning tread was heard. The prisoners turned their eyes\r\nupwards; Maguire looked towards them, half hopefully half appealingly;\r\nfrom Allen's glance nothing but defiance could be read; Larkin fixed\r\nhis gaze on the foreman, who held the fatal record in his hand, with\r\ncalm resolution; while a quiet smile played round O'Brien's lips, as\r\nhe turned to hear the expected words.\r\n\r\n\"Guilty!\" The word is snatched up from the lips of the foreman of the\r\njury, and whispered through the court. They were all \"guilty.\" So said\r\nthe jury; and a murmur of applause came rolling back in response to\r\nthe verdict. \"Guilty!\" A few there were in that court upon whom the\r\nfatal words fell with the bitterness of death, but the Englishmen\r\nwho filled the crowded gallery and passages exulted at the sound: the\r\nvengeance which they longed for was at hand.\r\n\r\nThe murmur died away; the sobs that rose from the dark recesses where\r\na few stricken-hearted women had been permitted to stand were stifled;\r\nand then, amidst breathless silence, the voice of the Crown Clerk was\r\nheard demanding \"if the prisoners had anything to say why sentence of\r\ndeath should not be pronounced on them.\"\r\n\r\nThe first to respond was Allen. A slight flush reddened his cheeks,\r\nand his eyes lit up with the fire of enthusiasm and determination, as,\r\nadvancing to the front of the dock, he confronted the Court, and spoke\r\nin resolute tones as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"My Lords and Gentlemen--It is not my intention to occupy much of\r\nyour time in answering your question. Your question is one that can\r\nbe easily asked, but requires an answer which I am ignorant of. Abler\r\nand more eloquent men could not answer it. Where were the men who have\r\nstood in the dock--Burke, Emmett, and others, who have stood in the\r\ndock in defence of their country? When the question was put, what\r\nwas their answer? Their answer was null and void. How, with your\r\npermission, I will review a portion of the evidence that has been\r\nbrought against me.\"\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Justice Blackburne interrupted. \"It was too late,\" he said,\r\n\"to criticise the evidence, and the Court had neither the right nor\r\nthe power to alter or review it. If,\" he added, \"you have any reason\r\nto give why, either upon technical or moral grounds, the sentence\r\nshould not be passed upon you, we will hear it, but it is too late for\r\nyou to review the evidence to show that it was wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannot that be done in the morning, Sir,\" asked Allen, who felt in\r\nhis heart how easily the evidence on which he had been convicted might\r\nbe torn to shreds. But the Judge said not. \"No one,\" he said, \"could\r\nalter or review the evidence in any way after the verdict had been\r\npassed by the jury. We can only\" he said in conclusion, \"take the\r\nverdict as right; and the only question for you is, why judgment\r\nshould not follow.\"\r\n\r\nThus restricted in the scope of his observations, the young felon\r\nproceeded to deliver the following patriotic and spirited address:--\r\n\r\n\"No man in this court regrets the death of Sergeant Brett more than\r\nI do, and I positively say, in the presence of the Almighty and\r\never-living God, that I am innocent, aye, as innocent as any man\r\nin this court. I don't say this for the sake of mercy: I want no\r\nmercy--I'll have no mercy. I'll die, as many thousands have died,\r\nfor the sake of their beloved land, and in defence of it. I will die\r\nproudly and triumphantly in defence of republican principles and the\r\nliberty of an oppressed and enslaved people. Is it possible we are\r\nasked why sentence should not be passed upon us, on the evidence\r\nof prostitutes off the streets of Manchester, fellows out of work,\r\nconvicted felons--aye, an Irishman sentenced to be hung when an\r\nEnglish dog would have got off. I say positively and defiantly,\r\njustice has not been done me since I was arrested. If justice had\r\nbeen done me, I would not have been handcuffed at the preliminary\r\ninvestigation in Bridge-street; and in this court justice has not\r\nbeen done me in any shape or form. I was brought up here, and all the\r\nprisoners by my side were allowed to wear overcoats, and I was told to\r\ntake mine off. What is the principle of that? There was something in\r\nthat principle, and I say positively that justice has not been done\r\nme. As for the other prisoners, they can speak for themselves with\r\nregard to that matter. And now with regard to the way I have been\r\nidentified. I have to say that my clothes were kept for four hours by\r\nthe policemen in Fairfield-station, and shown to parties to identify\r\nme as being one of the perpetrators of this outrage on Hyde-road. Also\r\nin Albert-station there was a handkerchief kept on my head the whole\r\nnight so that I could be identified the next morning in the corridor\r\nby the witnesses. I was ordered to leave on the handkerchief for\r\nthe purpose that the witnesses could more plainly see I was one of\r\nthe parties who committed the outrage. As for myself, I feel the\r\nrighteousness of my every art with regard to what I have done in\r\ndefence of my country I fear not. I am fearless--fearless of the\r\npunishment that can be inflicted on me; and with that, my lords, I\r\nhave done. (After a moment's pause)--I beg to be excused. One remark\r\nmore. I return Mr. Seymour and Mr. Jones my sincere and heartfelt\r\nthanks for their able eloquence and advocacy on my part in this\r\naffair. I wish also to return to Mr. Roberts the very same. My name,\r\nsir, might be wished to be, known. It is not William O'Meara Allen. My\r\nname is William Philip Allen. I was born and reared in Bandon, in the\r\ncounty of Cork, and from that place I take my name; and I am proud of\r\nmy country, and proud of my parentage. My lords, I have done.\"\r\n\r\nA sign of mingled applause and admiration rose faintly on the air, as\r\nthe gallant young Irishman, inclining his head slightly to the Court,\r\nretired to make way at the front, of the bar for one of his companions\r\nin misfortune. But his chivalrous bearing and noble words woke no\r\nresponse within the prejudice-hardened hearts of the majority of his\r\nauditors; they felt that the fearless words of the fearless youth\r\nwould overbear all that his accusers had uttered, and that the world\r\nwould read in them the condemnation, of the government and of the\r\npeople whose power he so bravely defied.\r\n\r\nMichael Larkin spoke next. He looked a shade paler than on the first\r\nday of the trial, but no want of resolution was expressed in his\r\nfirm-set face. He gazed with an unquailing glance round the faces\r\neagerly bent forward to catch his words, and then spoke in distinct\r\ntones as follows:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have only got a word or two to say concerning Serjeant\r\n    Brett. As my friend here said, no one could regret the man's\r\n    death as much as I do. With regard to the charge of pistols\r\n    and revolvers, and my using them, I call my God as a witness\r\n    that I neither used pistols, revolvers, nor any instrument on\r\n    that day that would deprive the life of a child, let alone\r\n    a man. Nor did I go there on purpose to take life away.\r\n    Certainly, my lords, I do not want to deny that I did go to\r\n    give aid and assistance to those two noble heroes that were\r\n    confined in that van--Kelly and Deasey. I did go to do as much\r\n    as lay in my power to extricate them out of their bondage; but\r\n    I did not go to take life, nor, my lords did anyone else. It\r\n    is a misfortune there was life taken, but if it was taken it\r\n    was not done intentionally, and the man who has taken life\r\n    we have not got him. I was at the scene of action, when there\r\n    were over, I dare say, 150 people standing by there when I\r\n    was. I am very sorry I have to say, my lord, but I thought I\r\n    had some respectable people to come up as witnesses against\r\n    me; but I am sorry to say as my friend said. I will make no\r\n    more remarks concerning that. All I have to say, my lords and\r\n    gentlemen, is that so far as my trial went and the way it was\r\n    conducted, I believe I have got a fair trial. So far as my\r\n    noble counsel went, they done their utmost in the protection\r\n    of my life; likewise, my worthy solicitor, Mr. Roberts, has\r\n    done his best; but I believe as the old saying is a true one,\r\n    what is decreed a man in the page of life he has to fulfil,\r\n    either on the gallows, drowning, a fair death in bed, or\r\n    on the battlefield. So I look to the mercy of God. May God\r\n    forgive all who have sworn my life away. As I am a dying man,\r\n    I forgive them from the bottom of my heart. God forgive them.\"\r\n\r\nAs Larkin ceased speaking, O'Brien, who stood to the right of him,\r\nmoved slightly in advance, and intimated by a slight inclination to\r\nthe Court his intention of addressing them. His stalwart form seemed\r\nto dilate with proud defiance and scorn as he faced the ermine-clad\r\ndignitaries who were about to consign, him to the gibbet. He spoke\r\nwith emphasis, and in tones which seemed to borrow a something of the\r\nfire and spirit of his words. He said:--\r\n\r\n    \"I shall commence by saying that every witness who has sworn\r\n    anything against me has sworn falsely. I have not had a stone\r\n    in my possession since I was a boy. I had no pistol in my\r\n    possession on the day when it is alleged this outrage was\r\n    committed. You call it an outrage, I don't. I say further,\r\n    my name is Michael O'Brien. I was born in the county of Cork,\r\n    and have the honour to be a fellow-parishioner of Peter\r\n    O'Neal Crowley, who was fighting against the British troops at\r\n    Mitchelstown last March, and who fell fighting against British\r\n    tyranny in Ireland. I am a citizen of the United States\r\n    of America, and if Charles Francis Adams had done his duty\r\n    towards me, as he ought to do in this country, I would not be\r\n    in this dock answering your questions now. Mr. Adams did not\r\n    come though I wrote to him. He did not come to see if I could\r\n    not find evidence to disprove the charge, which I positively\r\n    could, if he had taken the trouble of sending or coming to see\r\n    what I could do. I hope the American people will notice that\r\n    part of the business. [The prisoner here commenced reading\r\n    from a paper he held in his hand.] The right of man is\r\n    freedom. The great God has endowed him with affections that\r\n    he may use, not smother them, and a world that may be enjoyed.\r\n    Once a man is satisfied he is doing right, and attempts to do\r\n    anything with that conviction, he must be willing to face all\r\n    the consequences. Ireland, with its beautiful scenery, its\r\n    delightful climate, its rich and productive lands, is capable\r\n    of supporting more than treble its population in ease and\r\n    comfort. Yet no man, except a paid official of the British\r\n    government, can say there is a shadow of liberty, that there\r\n    is a spark of glad life amongst its plundered and persecuted\r\n    inhabitants. It is to be hoped that its imbecile and\r\n    tyrannical rulers will be for ever driven from her soil,\r\n    amidst the execration of the world. How beautifully the\r\n    aristocrats of England moralise on the despotism of the\r\n    rulers of Italy and Dahomey--in the case of Naples with what\r\n    indignation did they speak of the ruin of families by the\r\n    detention of its head or some loved member in a prison. Who\r\n    have not heard their condemnations of the tyranny that would\r\n    compel honourable and good men to spend their useful lives in\r\n    hopeless banishment.\"\r\n\r\nThe taunt went home to the hearts of his accusers, and, writhing under\r\nthe lash thus boldly applied, Judge Blackburne hastened, to intervene.\r\nUnable to stay, on _legal grounds_, the torrent of scathing invective\r\nby which O'Brien was driving the blood from the cheeks of his British\r\nlisteners, the judge resorted to a device which Mr. Justice Keogh\r\nhad practised very adroitly, and with much success, at various of the\r\nState trials in Ireland. He appealed to the prisoner, \"entirely for\r\nhis own sake,\" to cease his remarks. \"The only possible effect of your\r\nobservations.\" he said, \"must be to tell against you with those who\r\nhave to consider the sentence. I advise you to say nothing more of\r\nthat sort. I do so entirely for your own sake.\" But O'Brien was not\r\nthe man to be cowed into submission by this artful representation.\r\nPossibly he discerned the motive of the interruption, and estimated at\r\nits true value the disinterestedness of Judge Blackburne's \"advice.\"\r\nMr. Ernest Jones in vain used his influence to accomplish the\r\njudge's object. O'Brien spurned the treacherous bait, and resolutely\r\nproceeded:--\r\n\r\n    \"They cannot find words to express their horror of the\r\n    cruelties of the King of Dahomey because he sacrificed 2,000\r\n    human beings yearly, but why don't those persons who pretend\r\n    such virtuous indignation at the misgovernment of other\r\n    countries look at home, and see if greater crimes than those\r\n    they charge against other governments are not committed by\r\n    themselves or by their sanction. Let them look at London,\r\n    and see the thousands that want bread there, while those\r\n    aristocrats are rioting in luxuries and crimes. Look to\r\n    Ireland; see the hundreds of thousands of its people in misery\r\n    and want. See the virtuous, beautiful, and industrious women\r\n    who only a few years ago--aye, and yet--are obliged to look at\r\n    their children dying for want of food. Look at what is called\r\n    the majesty of the law on one side, and the long deep misery\r\n    of a noble people on the other. Which are the young men of\r\n    Ireland to respect--the law that murders or banishes their\r\n    people, or the means to resist relentless tyranny and ending\r\n    their miseries for ever under a home government? I need not\r\n    answer that question here. I trust the Irish people will\r\n    answer it to their satisfaction soon. I am not astonished at\r\n    my conviction. The government of this country have the power\r\n    of convicting any person. They appoint the judge; they choose\r\n    the jury; and by means of what they call patronage (which is\r\n    the means of corruption) they have the power of making the\r\n    laws to suit their purposes. I am confident that my blood\r\n    will rise a hundredfold against the tyrants who think proper\r\n    to commit such an outrage. In the first place, I say I was\r\n    identified improperly, by having chains on my hands and feet\r\n    at the time of identification, and thus the witnesses who have\r\n    sworn to my throwing stones and firing a pistol have sworn to\r\n    what is false, for I was, as those ladies said, at the jail\r\n    gates. I thank my counsel for their able defence, and also Mr.\r\n    Roberts, for his attention to my case.\"\r\n\r\nEdward Maguire spoke next. He might well have felt bewildered at\r\nthe situation in which he found himself, but he spoke earnestly and\r\ncollectedly, nevertheless. He had had an experience of British law\r\nwhich, if not without precedent, was still extraordinary enough to\r\ncreate amazement. He knew that he had never been a Fenian; he knew\r\nthat he never saw Colonel Kelly--never heard of him until arrested\r\nfor assisting in his liberation; he knew that while the van was being\r\nattacked at Bellevue, he was sitting in his own home, miles away; and\r\nhe knew that he had never in his life placed his foot in the scene of\r\nthe rescue; yet there he found himself convicted by regular process\r\nof law, of the murder of Constable Brett. He had seen witness after\r\nwitness enter the box, and deliberately swear they saw him take a\r\nprominent part in the rescue. He saw policemen and civilians coolly\r\nidentify him as a ringleader in the affair; he had heard the Crown\r\nlawyers weave round him the subtle meshes of their logic; and now\r\nhe found himself pronounced guilty by the jury, in the teeth of the\r\noverwhelming array of unimpeachable evidence brought forward in his\r\ndefence. What \"the safeguards of the Constitution\" mean--what \"the\r\nbulwark of English freedom,\" and \"the Palladium of British freedom\"\r\nare worth, when Englishmen fill the jury-box and an Irishman stands in\r\nthe dock, Maguire had had a fair opportunity of judging. Had he been\r\nreflectively inclined, he might, too, have found himself compelled to\r\nadopt a rather low estimate of the credibility of English witnesses,\r\nwhen they get an opportunity of swearing away an Irishman's life. An\r\nimpetuous man might have been goaded by the circumstances into cursing\r\nthe atrocious system under which \"justice\" had been administered to\r\nhim, and calling down the vengeance of Heaven on the whole nation from\r\nwhich the perjured wretches who swore away his life had been drawn.\r\nBut Maguire acted more discreetly; he began, indeed, by declaring that\r\nall the witnesses who swore against him were perjurers--by vehemently\r\nprotesting that the case, as regarded him, was one of mistaken\r\nidentity; but he shortly took surer ground, by referring to his\r\nservices in the navy, and talking of his unfailing loyalty to \"his\r\nQueen and his country.\" He went through the record of his services\r\nas a marine; appealed to the character he had obtained from his\r\ncommanding officers, in confirmation of his words: and concluded by\r\nsolemnly protesting his perfect innocence of the charge on which he\r\nhad been convicted.\r\n\r\nWhile Maguire's impressive words were still ringing in the ears of\r\nhis conscience-stricken accusers, Edward O'Meagher Condon commenced to\r\nspeak. He was evidently more of an orator than either of those who had\r\npreceded him, and he spoke with remarkable fluency, grace, and vigour.\r\nThe subjoined is a correct report of his spirited and able address:--\r\n\r\n    \"My Lords--this has come upon me somewhat by surprise.\r\n    It appeared to me rather strange that upon any amount of\r\n    evidence, which of course was false, a man could have been\r\n    convicted of wilfully murdering others he never saw or heard\r\n    of before he was put in prison. I do not care to detain your\r\n    lordships, but I cannot help remarking that Mr. Shaw, who has\r\n    come now to gloat upon his victims, alter having sworn away\r\n    their lives--that man has sworn what is altogether false; and\r\n    there are contradictions in the depositions which have not\r\n    been brought before your lordships' notice. I suppose the\r\n    depositions being imperfect, there was no necessity for it.\r\n    As to Mr. Batty, he swore at his first examination before the\r\n    magistrates that a large stone fell on me, a stone which Mr.\r\n    Roberts said at the time would have killed an elephant. But\r\n    not the slightest mark was found on my head; and if I was to\r\n    go round the country, and him with me, as exhibiting the stone\r\n    having fallen on me, and him as the man who would swear to\r\n    it, I do not know which would be looked for with the most\r\n    earnestness. However, it has been accepted by the jury. Now he\r\n    says he only thinks so. There is another matter to consider.\r\n    I have been sworn to, I believe, by some of the witnesses who\r\n    have also sworn to others, though some of them can prove they\r\n    were in another city altogether--in Liverpool. Others have an\r\n    overwhelming _alibi_, and I should by right have been tried\r\n    with them; but I suppose your lordships cannot help that.\r\n    We have, for instance, Thomas, the policeman, who swore to\r\n    another prisoner. He identified him on a certain day, and\r\n    the prisoner was not arrested for two days afterwards. As for\r\n    Thomas, I do not presume that any jury could have believed\r\n    him. He had heard of the blood-money, and of course was\r\n    prepared to bid pretty high for it. My _alibi_ has not been\r\n    strong, and unfortunately I was not strong in pocket, and was\r\n    not able to produce more testimony to prove where I was at\r\n    exactly that time. With regard to the unfortunate man who\r\n    has lost his life, I sympathize with him and his family as\r\n    deeply as your lordships or the jury, or anyone in the court.\r\n    I deeply regret the unfortunate occurrence, but I am as\r\n    perfectly innocent of his blood as any man. I never had the\r\n    slightest intention of taking life. I have done nothing at\r\n    all in connection with that man, and I do not desire to be\r\n    accused of a murder which I have not committed. With regard to\r\n    another matter, my learned counsel has, no doubt for the best,\r\n    expressed some opinions on these matters and the misgovernment\r\n    to which my country has been subjected. I am firmly convinced\r\n    there is prejudice in the minds of the people, and it has been\r\n    increased and excited by the newspapers, or by some of them,\r\n    and to a certain extent has influenced the minds of the jury\r\n    to convict the men standing in this dock, on a charge of\r\n    which--a learned gentleman remarked a few nights since--they\r\n    would be acquitted if they had been charged with murdering\r\n    an old woman for the sake of the money in her pocket, but a\r\n    political offence of this kind they could not. Now, sir, with\r\n    regard to the opinions I hold on national matters--with regard\r\n    to those men who have been released from that van, in which,\r\n    unfortunately, life was lost, I am of opinion that certainly\r\n    to some extent there was an excess. Perhaps it was unthought,\r\n    but if those men had been in other countries, occupying other\r\n    positions--if Jefferson Davis had been released in a northern\r\n    city, there would have been a cry of applause throughout all\r\n    England. If Garibaldi, who I saw before I was shut out from\r\n    the world had been arrested, was released, or something of\r\n    that kind had taken place, they would have applauded the\r\n    bravery of the act. If the captives of King Theodore had\r\n    been released, that too would have been applauded. But, as\r\n    it happened to be in England, of course it is an awful thing,\r\n    while yet in Ireland murders are perpetrated on unoffending\r\n    men, as in the case of the riots in Waterford, where an\r\n    unoffending man was murdered, and no one was punished for it.\r\n    I do not desire to detain your lordships. I can only say that\r\n    I leave this world without a stain on my conscience that I\r\n    have been wilfully guilty of anything in connexion with the\r\n    death of Sergeant Brett. I am totally guiltless. I leave this\r\n    world without malice to anyone. I do not accuse the jury,\r\n    but I believe they were prejudiced. I don't accuse them of\r\n    wilfully wishing to convict, but prejudice has induced them\r\n    to convict when they otherwise would not have done. With\r\n    reference to the witnesses, every one of them has sworn\r\n    falsely. I never threw a stone or fired a pistol; I was never\r\n    at the place, as they have said; it is all totally false. But\r\n    as I have to go before my God. I forgive them. They will be\r\n    able to meet me, some day, before that God who is to judge us\r\n    all, and then they and the people in this Court, and everyone,\r\n    will know who tells the truth. Had I committed anything\r\n    against the Crown of England, I would have scorned myself had\r\n    I attempted to deny it; but with regard to those men, they\r\n    have sworn what is altogether false. Had I been an Englishman,\r\n    and arrested near the scene of that disturbance, I would\r\n    have been brought as a witness to identify them; but being an\r\n    Irishman, it was supposed my sympathy was with them, and on\r\n    suspicion of that sympathy I was arrested, and in consequence\r\n    of the arrest, and the rewards which were offered, I was\r\n    identified. It could not be otherwise. As I said before, my\r\n    opinions on national matters do not at all relate to the case\r\n    before your lordships. We have been found guilty, and, as\r\n    a matter of course we accept our death as gracefully as\r\n    possible. We are not afraid to die--at least I am not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I,\" \"Nor I,\" \"Nor I,\" swelled up from the lips of his companions,\r\nand then, with a proud smile, Condon continued:--\r\n\r\n    \"I have no sin or stain upon me; and I leave this world at\r\n    peace with all. With regard to the other prisoners who are to\r\n    be tried afterwards, I hope our blood at least will satisfy\r\n    the cravings for it. I hope our blood will be enough, and that\r\n    those men who I honestly believe are guiltless of the blood\r\n    of that man--that the other batches will get a fair, free,\r\n    and a more impartial trial. We view matters in a different\r\n    light from what the jury do. We have been imprisoned, and\r\n    have not had the advantage of understanding exactly to what\r\n    this excitement has led. I can only hope and pray that this\r\n    prejudice will disappear--that my poor country will right\r\n    herself some day, and that her people, so far from being\r\n    looked upon with scorn and aversion, will receive what they\r\n    are entitled to, the respect not only of the civilized world,\r\n    but of Englishmen. I, too, am an American citizen, and on\r\n    English territory I have committed no crime which makes me\r\n    amenable to the crown of England. I have done nothing; and, as\r\n    a matter of course, I did expect protection--as this gentleman\r\n    (pointing to Allen) has said, the protection of the ambassador\r\n    of my government. I am a citizen of the State of Ohio; but\r\n    I am sorry to say my name is not Shore. My name is Edward\r\n    O'Meagher Condon. I belong to Ohio, and there are loving\r\n    hearts there that will be sorry for this. I have nothing but\r\n    my best wishes to send them, and my best feelings, and assure\r\n    them I can die as a Christian and an Irishman; and that I\r\n    am not ashamed or afraid of anything I have done, or the\r\n    consequences, before God or man. They would be ashamed of me\r\n    if I was in the slightest degree a coward, or concealed my\r\n    opinions. The unfortunate divisions of our countrymen in\r\n    America, have, to a certain extent, neutralized the efforts\r\n    that we have made either in one direction or another for\r\n    the liberation of our country. All these things have been\r\n    thwarted, and as a matter of course we must only submit to our\r\n    fate. I only trust again, that those who are to be tried after\r\n    us, will have a fair trial, and that our blood will satisfy\r\n    the craving which I understand exists. You will soon send us\r\n    before God, and I am perfectly prepared to go. I have nothing\r\n    to regret, or to retract, or take back. I can only say, GOD\r\n    SAVE IRELAND.\"\r\n\r\nAgain were the voices of his companions raised in unison. \"God save\r\nIreland!\" they cried defiantly, in chorus. \"God save Ireland!\" The\r\ncry rung through the packed justice-hall, and fell on the ears of its\r\nblood-thirsty occupants like the voice of an accusing angel. \"God save\r\nIreland,\" they said; and then the brave-hearted fellows gazed fiercely\r\naround the hostile gathering, as if daring them to interfere with the\r\nprayer. \"God save Ireland!\"--from the few broken-hearted relatives who\r\nlistened to the patriots' prayer the responsive \"Amen\" was breathed\r\nback, and the dauntless young Irishman continued:--\r\n\r\n    \"I wish to add a word or two. There is nothing in the close\r\n    of my political career which I regret. I don't know of one act\r\n    which could bring the blush of shame to my face, or make me\r\n    afraid to meet my God or fellow-man. I would be most happy,\r\n    and nothing would give me greater pleasure than to die on the\r\n    field for my country in defence of her liberty. As it is,\r\n    I cannot die on the field, but I can die on the scaffold, I\r\n    hope, as a soldier, a man, and a Christian.\"\r\n\r\nAnd now the last was spoken. As true Irishmen and as true patriots\r\nthey had borne themselves. No trace of flinching did they give for\r\ntheir enemies to gloat over--no sign of weakness which could take from\r\nthe effect of their deathless words. With bold front and steady mien\r\nthey stood forward to listen to the fatal decree their judges were\r\nready to pronounce. The judges produced the black caps, with which\r\nthey had come provided, and then Justice Mellor proceeded to pass\r\nsentence. No person, he said, who had witnessed the proceedings could\r\ndoubt the propriety of the verdict, which, he insisted, was the\r\nresult of \"a full, patient, and impartial investigation.\" He made no\r\ndistinction. \"I am perfectly convinced,\" he said, \"that all of you\r\nhad resolved, at any risk, and by any amount of dangerous violence and\r\noutrage, to accomplish your object; and that, in fact, Charles Brett\r\nwas murdered because it was essential to the completion of your common\r\ndesign that he should be.\" The stereotyped words of exhortation to\r\nrepentance followed, and then the judge concluded:--\r\n\r\n    \"The sentence is that you, and each of you, be taken hence to\r\n    the place whence you came, and thence to a place of execution,\r\n    and that you be there hanged by the neck until you shall be\r\n    dead, and that your bodies be afterwards buried within the\r\n    precincts of the prison wherein you were last confined after\r\n    your respective convictions; and may God, in His infinite\r\n    mercy, have mercy upon you.\"\r\n\r\nWith quiet composure the doomed men heard the words. They warmly shook\r\nhands with their counsel, thanked them for their exertions, and then,\r\nlooking towards the spot where their weeping friends were seated, they\r\nturned to leave the dock. \"God be with you, Irishmen and Irishwomen!\"\r\nthey cried and, as they disappeared from the court, their final adieu\r\nwas heard in the same prayer that had swelled upwards to heaven from\r\nthem before--\r\n\r\n\"GOD SAVE IRELAND!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"GOD SAVE IRELAND!\"]\r\n\r\nScarcely had the Manchester courthouse ceased to echo those voices\r\nfrom the dock, when the glaring falseness of the verdict became the\r\ntheme of comment amongst even the most thoroughgoing Englishmen who\r\nhad been present throughout the trial.\r\n\r\nWithout more ado, down sate some thirty or forty reporters, who, as\r\nrepresentatives of the English metropolitan and provincial press,\r\nhad attended the Commission, and addressed a memorial to the Home\r\nSecretary, stating that they had been long accustomed to attend at\r\ntrials on capital charges; that they had extensive experience of\r\nsuch cases, from personal observation of prisoners in the dock and\r\nwitnesses on the table; and that they were solemnly convinced, the\r\nswearing of the witnesses and the verdict of the jury to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding, that the man Maguire had neither hand, act, nor part\r\nin the crime for which he had been sentenced to death. The following\r\nis the petition referred to:--\r\n\r\n    We, the undersigned members of the metropolitan and provincial\r\n    Press, having had long experience in courts of justice, and\r\n    full opportunity of observing the demeanour of prisoners and\r\n    witnesses in cases of criminal procedure, beg humbly to submit\r\n    that, having heard the evidence adduced before the Special\r\n    Commission, on the capital charge preferred against Thomas\r\n    Maguire, private in the Royal Marines, we conscientiously\r\n    believe that the said Thomas Maguire is innocent of the crime\r\n    of which he has been convicted, and that his conviction has\r\n    resulted from mistaken identity. We, therefore, pray that\r\n    you will be pleased to advise her Majesty to grant her most\r\n    gracious pardon to the said Thomas Maguire.\r\n\r\nThis was a startling event; it was a proceeding utterly without\r\nprecedent. Nothing but the most extraordinary circumstances could have\r\ncalled it forth. The blunder of the jury must have been open, glaring,\r\npainfully notorious, indeed, when such an astonishing course was\r\nadopted by the whole staff of the English Press.\r\n\r\nIt was most embarrassing. For what had those newspaper reporters seen\r\nor heard that the jurors had not seen and heard?--and yet the jurors\r\nsaid Maguire was guilty. What had those reporters seen or heard that\r\nthe judges had not seen and heard?--and yet the judges said they\r\n\"fully concurred in the verdict of the jury.\" The reporters were not\r\nsworn on the Evangelists of God to give a true deliverance--but the\r\njurors were. The reporters were not sworn to administer justice--were\r\nnot dressed in ermine--were not bound to be men of legal ability,\r\njudicial calmness, wisdom, and impartiality--but the judges were. Yet\r\nthe unsworn reporters told the government Maguire was an innocent man;\r\nwhile judge and jury told the government--_swore_ to it--that he was a\r\nguilty murderer!\r\n\r\nWhat was the government to do? Was it to act on the verdict of\r\nnewspaper reporters who had happened to be present at this trial,\r\nand not on the verdict of the jury who had been solemnly sworn in the\r\ncase? Behind the reporters' verdict lay the huge sustaining power of\r\nalmost universal conviction, mysteriously felt and owned, though as\r\nyet nowhere expressed. Everyone who had calmly and dispassionately\r\nweighed the evidence, arrived at conclusions identical with those of\r\nthe Press jury, and utterly opposed to those of the sworn jury. The\r\nministers themselves--it was a terribly embarassing truth to own--felt\r\nthat the reporters were as surely right as the jurors were surely\r\nwrong. But what were they to do? What a frightful imputation would\r\npublic admission of that fact cast upon the twelve sworn jurors--upon\r\nthe two judges? What a damning imputation on their judgment or their\r\nimpartiality! Was it to be admitted that newspaper reporters could\r\nbe right in a case so awful, where twelve sworn jurors and two judges\r\nwere wrong?\r\n\r\nAnd then, look at the consequences. The five men were convicted\r\nin the one verdict. There were not five separate verdicts, but\r\none indivisible verdict. If the (jurors') verdict were publicly\r\nvitiated--if the government confessed or admitted that verdict to be\r\nfalse--it was not one man, but five men, who were affected by it.\r\nTo be sure the reporters' jury, in _their_ verdict, did not include\r\nAllen, O'Brien, Larkin, and Shore; but was it to be conveyed by\r\nimplication that omission from the reporters' verdict of acquittal was\r\nmore fatal to a man than inclusion in the verdict of guilty by a sworn\r\njury? Might not twenty, or thirty, or forty men, quite as intelligent\r\nas the reporters, be soon forthcoming to testify as forcibly of Allen,\r\nO'Brien, Larkin, and Shore, as the Press-men had testified of Maguire?\r\nWas it only _reporters_ whose judgment could set aside the verdict of\r\nsworn jurors, endorsed by ermined judges? But, in any event, the five\r\nmen were convicted by the one verdict. To cut that, loosed all--not\r\nnecessarily in law, perhaps, but inevitably as regarded public\r\nconscience and universal judgment; for there was not in all the\r\nrecords of English jurisprudence a precedent for executing men on a\r\nverdict acknowledged to have been one of blunder or perjury. Clearly,\r\nif the jurors were to be told by the government that, in a case\r\nwhere life and death hung on the issue, they had been so blinded\r\nby excitement, passion, or prejudice, that they declared to be a\r\nguilty murderer a man whose innocence was patent even to unofficial\r\nlookers-on in court, the moral value of such a verdict was\r\ngone--ruined for ever; and to hang _anyone_ on such a verdict--_on\r\nthat identical verdict, thus blasted and abandoned_--would, it was\r\npointed out, be murder, for all its technical legality; neither more\r\nnor less, morally, than cool, deliberate, cold-blooded murder.\r\n\r\nEverybody saw this; but everyone in England saw also the awkward\r\ndifficulty of the case. For, to let Allen, O'Brien, Larkin, and\r\nShore go free of death, in the face of their admitted complicity in\r\nthe rescue, would baulk the national demand for vengeance. It was\r\nnecessary that some one should be executed. Here were men who, though\r\nthey almost certainly had had no hand in causing, even accidentally,\r\nthe death of Brett, dared to boast of their participation in the\r\naffray in the course of which that lamentable event unhappily\r\noccurred--that rescue which had so painfully wounded and humiliated\r\nEnglish national pride. If these men were saved from execution,\r\nowing to any foolish scruples about hanging a possibly--nay,\r\nprobably--innocent man along with them, a shout of rage would\r\nascend from that virtuous nation amongst whom Charlotte Winsor, the\r\nprofessional infant-murderess, walks a free woman, notwithstanding a\r\njury's verdict of wilful murder and a judge's sentence of death.\r\n\r\nSo, for a time it seemed that, notwithstanding the verdict of the\r\nreporters, the government would act upon the verdict of the jury, and\r\nassume it to be correct. No doubt Maguire might be innocent, but it\r\nwas his misfortune to be included in an indivisible verdict with other\r\nmen, who, though perhaps as guiltless as he of wilful murder, were\r\nsurely guilty of riot and rescue, aggravated by the utterance of the\r\nmost bitter reflections on the British Constitution, which all men\r\nknow to be the \"envy of surrounding nations.\" If they were not guilty\r\nof the crime laid against them on the trial, they were guilty of\r\nsomething else--they had outraged British pride. It was necessary they\r\nshould die; and as Maguire's verdict was not separate from theirs, he\r\nmust die too, rather than that they should escape.\r\n\r\nBut after a while the idea gained ground in England that this would\r\nbe rather _too_ monstrous a proceeding. Maguire's utter innocence of\r\nany participation whatsoever in the rescue was too notorious. The\r\ncharacter of the witnesses on whose evidence he was convicted became\r\nknown: some were thieves, pickpockets, or gaol-birds of some other\r\ndenomination; others were persons palpably confused by panic,\r\nexcitement, passion, or prejudice. True, these same witnesses were\r\nthose who likewise swore against Allen, Larkin, O'Brien and Shore.\r\nIndeed, a greater number swore against Maguire than against some of\r\nthe others. Nevertheless, the overwhelming notoriety of the jury's\r\nblunder or perjury, in at least his case, became daily more and more\r\nan obstacle to his execution; and eventually, on the 21st of November,\r\nit was announced that his conviction had been cancelled, by the only\r\nmeans existing under the perfect laws of Great Britain--namely, a\r\n\"free _pardon_\" for a crime never committed. The prison doors were\r\nopened for Maguire; the sworn jurors were plainly told in effect\r\nthat their blunder or perjury had well-nigh done the murder of at\r\nleast one innocent man. The judges were in like manner told that\r\nshorthand-writers had been more clear-headed or dispassionate to weigh\r\nevidence and judge guilt than they. The indivisible verdict had been\r\nopenly proclaimed worthless.\r\n\r\nThe news was received with a sense of relief in Ireland, where the\r\nwholesale recklessness of the swearing, and the transparent falseness\r\nof the verdict had, from the first, created intense indignation and\r\nresentment. Everyone knew and saw that, whatever might have been the\r\nparticipation of those men in the rescue of Colonel Kelly, they had\r\nnot had a fair trial; nay, that their so-called trial was an outrage\r\non all law and justice; that witnesses, jurors and judges, were in the\r\nfull fierce heat of excitement, panic, and passion--much more ready\r\nto swear evidence, to find verdicts, and to pass sentences against\r\ninnocent men than they themselves were, perhaps, conscious of while\r\nlabouring under such influences. The public and official recognition\r\nof the falseness and injustice of the Manchester verdict was therefore\r\nhailed with intense satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMaguire was at once liberated; Allen, Larkin, Shore, and O'Brien\r\nwere still detained in custody. It was universally concluded that,\r\nnotwithstanding the abandonment by the Crown of the verdict on which\r\nthey had been sentenced, they, because of their admitted complicity\r\nin the rescue, would be held to imprisonment--probably penal\r\nservitude--for a term of years. Considerable astonishment was excited,\r\nsome days subsequently to Maguire's pardon, by a statement that, in\r\nthe case of the other prisoners included in the verdict, \"the law\r\nshould take its course.\" No one credited this declaration for an\r\ninstant, and most persons felt that the Crown officials were indulging\r\nin an indecent piece of mockery. Amidst this universal incredulity,\r\nhowever--this disdainful and indignant disbelief--the prisoners'\r\nsolicitor, Mr. Roberts, vigilant and untiring to the last, took the\r\nnecessary steps to pray arrest of execution pending decision of the\r\nserious law points raised on the trial. Some of the most eminent\r\ncounsel in England certified solemnly that these points were of the\r\ngravest nature, and would, in their opinion, be fully established on\r\nargument before the judges; in which event the conviction would be\r\nlegally quashed, independently of the substantial abandonment of it as\r\nfalse and untenable by the Crown in Maguire's case.\r\n\r\nThe first idea of the merest possibility--the faintest chance--of\r\nthe remaining four men being executed on the vitiated verdict, arose\r\nwhen it became known that the judges, or some of them, had informally\r\ndeclared to the government (without waiting to hear any argument on\r\nthe subject) that the points raised by the prisoners' counsel were\r\nnot tenable, or were not of force. Mr. Roberts was officially informed\r\nthat the sentence would infallibly be carried out. By this time barely\r\na few days remained of the interval previous to the date fixed for\r\nthe execution, and the strangest sensations swayed the public mind in\r\nIreland. Even still, no one would seriously credit that men would be\r\nput to death on a verdict notoriously false. Some persons who proposed\r\nmemorials to the Queen were met on all hands with the answer that it\r\nwas all \"acting\" on the part of the government; that, even though it\r\nshould be at the foot of the scaffold, the men would be reprieved;\r\nthat the government would not--_dare not_--take away human life on a\r\nverdict already vitiated and abandoned as a perjury or blunder.\r\n\r\nThe day of doom approached; and now, as it came nearer and nearer,\r\na painful and sickening alternation of incredulity and horror surged\r\nthrough every Irish heart. Meanwhile, the Press of England, on\r\nboth sides of the Channel, kept up a ceaseless cry for blood. The\r\ngovernment were told that to let these men off, innocent or guilty,\r\nwould be \"weakness.\" They were called upon to be \"firm\"--that is, to\r\nhang first, and reflect afterwards. As the 23rd of November drew near,\r\nthe opinion began to gain ground, even in England, that things had\r\nbeen too hastily done--that the whole trial bore all the traces of\r\npanic--and that, if a few weeks were given for alarm and passion\r\nto calm down, not a voice would approve the Manchester verdict.\r\nPerceiving this--perceiving that time or opportunity for reflection,\r\nor for the subsidence of panic, would almost certainly snatch its prey\r\nfrom vengeance--a deafening yell arose from the raving creatures of\r\nblood-hunger, demanding that not a day, not an hour, not a second,\r\nshould be granted to the condemned.\r\n\r\nStill the Irish people would not credit that, far towards the close of\r\nthe nineteenth century, an act so dreadful durst be done.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time the condemned lay in Salford gaol, tortured by\r\nthe suspense inevitably created by Maguire's reprieve. Although every\r\neffort was made by their friends to keep them from grasping at or\r\nindulging in hope, the all-significant fact of that release seemed\r\nto imperatively forbid the idea of their being executed on a verdict\r\nwhose falseness was thus confessed. The moment, however, that the\r\nsingular conduct of the judges in London defeated the application of\r\nMr. Roberts, they, one and all, resigned themselves to the worst;\r\nand while their fellow-countrymen at home were still utterly and\r\nscornfully incredulous on the subject, devoted their remaining hours\r\nexclusively to spiritual preparation for death upon the scaffold.\r\n\r\nIt was now that each character \"rushed to its index.\" It was\r\nnow--within the very shadow of death--in the most awful crisis that\r\ncan test the soul--that these men rose into the grandeur and sublimity\r\nof true heroism. They looked death in the face with serene and\r\ncheerful composure. So far from requiring consolation, it was they\r\nwho strove most earnestly to console the grieving friends they were\r\nleaving behind; imploring of them to exhibit resignation to the will\r\nof God, and assuring them that, ignominious as was death upon the\r\ngallows, and terrible as was the idea of suffering such a fate\r\nunjustly, it was \"not hard to die\" with a clear and tranquil\r\nconscience, as they were dying, for the cause of native land.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether the martyrology of any nation in history\r\ncan exhibit anything more noble, more edifying--more elevating and\r\ninspiring--than the last hours of these doomed Irishmen. Their\r\nevery thought, their every utterance, was full of tenderness and\r\nholiness--full of firmness and cheerful acceptance of God's will.\r\nThe farewell letters addressed by them to their relatives and\r\nfriends--from which we take a few--amply illustrate the truth of\r\nthe foregoing observations. Here is O'Brien's last letter to his\r\nbrother:--\r\n\r\n    New Bailey Prison, Salford,\r\n\r\n    Nov. 14th, 1867.\r\n\r\n    My dear brother--I have been intending to write to you\r\n    for some time, but having seen a letter from a Mr. Moore,\r\n    addressed to the governor of this prison, and knowing from\r\n    that that you must be in a disagreeable state of suspense, I\r\n    may therefore let you know how I am at once. With reference\r\n    to the trial and all connected with it, it was unfair from\r\n    beginning to end; and if I should die in consequence it will\r\n    injure my murderers more than it will injure me. Why should I\r\n    fear to die, innocent as I am of the charge which a prejudiced\r\n    jury, assisted by perjured witnesses, found me guilty of? I\r\n    will do judge and jury the justice of saying they believed\r\n    me guilty of being--a citizen of the United States, a friend\r\n    to liberty, a hater of relentless cruelty, and therefore\r\n    no friend to the British government, as it exists in our\r\n    beautiful island. I must say, though much I would like to\r\n    live, that I cannot regret dying in the cause of Liberty and\r\n    Ireland. It has been made dear to me by the sufferings of its\r\n    people, by the martyrdom and exile of its best and noblest\r\n    sons. The priest, the scholar, the soldier, the saint, have\r\n    suffered and died, proudly, nobly: and why should I shrink\r\n    from death in a cause made holy and glorious by the numbers\r\n    of its martyrs and the heroism of its supporters, as well as\r\n    by its justice? You don't, and never shall, forget that Peter\r\n    O'Neill Crowley died only a short time since, in this cause.\r\n\r\n  \"Far dearer the grave or the prison,\r\n    Illum'd by one patriot name,\r\n  Than the trophies of all who have risen\r\n    On liberty's ruins to fame.\"\r\n\r\n    I should feel ashamed of my manhood if I thought myself\r\n    capable of doing anything mean to save my life, to get out\r\n    of here, or for any other selfish purpose. Let no man think\r\n    a cause is lost because some suffer for it. It is only a\r\n    proof that those who suffer are in earnest, and should be an\r\n    incentive to others to be equally so--to do their duty with\r\n    firmness, justice, and disinterestedness. _I feel confident\r\n    of the ultimate success of the Irish cause, as I do of my\r\n    own existence._ God, in His great mercy and goodness, will\r\n    strengthen the arm of the patriot, and give him wisdom to\r\n    free his country. Let us hope that He, in His wisdom, is only\r\n    trying our patience. The greater its sufferings, the more\r\n    glorious will He make the future of our unfortunate country\r\n    and its people.\r\n\r\n    The shriek of the famine-stricken mother and the helpless\r\n    infant, as well as the centuries of misery, call to heaven\r\n    for vengeance. God is slow, but just! The blood of Tone,\r\n    Fitzgerald, Emmett, and others has been shed--how much good\r\n    has it done the tyrant and the robber? None. Smith O'Brien,\r\n    McManus, and Mitchel suffered for Ireland, yet not their\r\n    sufferings, nor those of O'Donovan (Bossa) and his companions,\r\n    deterred Burke, McAfferty, and their friends from doing their\r\n    duty. Neither shall the sufferings of my companions, nor mine,\r\n    hinder my countrymen from taking their part in the inevitable\r\n    struggle, but rather nerve their arms to strike. I would write\r\n    on this subject at greater length, but I hope that I have\r\n    written enough to show you that if a man dies for liberty, his\r\n    memory lives in the breasts of the good and virtuous. You will\r\n    also see that there is no necessity for my father, mother,\r\n    sisters or relations fretting about me. When I leave this\r\n    world it will be (with God's help) to go to a better, to join\r\n    the angels and saints of God, and sing His praises for all\r\n    eternity. I leave a world of suffering for one of eternal joy\r\n    and happiness. I have been to Holy Communion, and, please God,\r\n    intend going shortly again. I am sorry we cannot hear Mass;\r\n    the good priest is not allowed to say it in this prison.\r\n\r\n    Give my love to my father and mother, to Mary, Ellen, John\r\n    Phillips, Tim, Catherine, uncles, aunts, and cousins.\r\n\r\n    Farewell.\r\n\r\n    From your affectionate brother,\r\n\r\n    MICHAEL O'BRIEN (_alias_ William Gould).\r\n\r\nThe following is one of Allen's letters to his relatives, written the\r\nday before his execution:--\r\n\r\n    Salford, New Bailey Prison, Nov. 23rd, 1867.\r\n\r\n    TO YOU, MY LOVING AND SINCERE DEAR UNCLE AND AUNT HOGAN,\r\n\r\n    I suppose this is my last letter to you at this side of the\r\n    grave. Oh, dear uncle and aunt, if you reflect on it, it\r\n    is nothing. I am dying an honourable death: I am dying _for\r\n    Ireland_--dying for the land that gave me birth--dying for\r\n    the Island of Saints--and dying for liberty. Every generation\r\n    of our countrymen has suffered; and where is the Irish heart\r\n    could stand by unmoved? I should like to know what trouble,\r\n    what passion, what mischief could separate the true Irish\r\n    heart from its own native isle. Dear uncle and aunt, it is\r\n    sad to be parting you all, at my early age; but we must all\r\n    die some day or another. A few hours more and I will breathe\r\n    my last, and on English soil. Oh, that I could be buried in\r\n    Ireland! What a happiness it would be to all my friends, and\r\n    to myself--where my countrymen could kneel on my grave. I\r\n    cannot express what joy it afforded me, when I found Aunt\r\n    Sarah and you were admitted. Dear uncle, I am sure it was not\r\n    a very pleasant place I had to receive you and my aunt; but\r\n    we must put up with all trials until we depart this life. I am\r\n    sure it will grieve you very much to leave me in such a place,\r\n    on the evidence of such characters as the witnesses were that\r\n    swore my life away. But I forgive them, and may God forgive\r\n    them. I am dying, thank God! an Irishman and a Christian.\r\n    Give my love to all friends; same from your ever affectionate\r\n    nephew,\r\n\r\n    W.P. ALLEN.\r\n\r\n    Pray for us. Good bye, and remember me. Good bye, and may\r\n    heaven protect ye, is the last wish of your dying nephew,\r\n\r\n    W.P. ALLEN.\r\n\r\nLarkin was the only one of the condemned four who was married. There\r\nwere to weep his fall, besides his aged parents, a devoted wife\r\nand three little children--all young; and it redounds rather to his\r\nhonour, that though flinching in nowise, lacking nought in courageous\r\nfirmness, home ties were painfully strong around his heart. With\r\nhim it was anguish indeed to part for ever the faithful wife and the\r\nlittle ones who used to nestle in his bosom. Ah! he was never more to\r\nfeel those little arms twining round his neck--never more to see those\r\ninfant faces gazing into his own--never more to part the flaxen curls\r\nover each unfurrowed brow! Henceforth they would look for his coming\r\nand hearken for his footfall in vain! They would call upon him, and be\r\nanswered only by the convulsive sobs of their widowed mother. And who\r\nwould now fill his place for them, even as bread-winner? Mayhap, when\r\nhe lay in the grave, these cherished little ones, for whom he would\r\ndraw the life-blood from his heart, would feel the hunger-pangs of\r\norphanage in squalid misery and obscurity! But no. If such a thought\r\napproached Larkin's heart, it was at once repelled. Assuredly, he\r\nhad more faith in his countrymen--more faith in the fidelity and\r\ngenerosity of his race--than to believe they would suffer one of those\r\norphans to want loving, helping, guiding hands. As he himself said, he\r\nwas not, after all, leaving them fatherless; he was bequeathing them\r\nto Ireland and to God.\r\n\r\nAnd the Father of the Fatherless, even on the instant, raised up a\r\nfriend for them--sent an angel missioner of blessed comfort to give\r\npoor Larkin, even on the brink of the grave, assurance that no pang of\r\npoverty should ever wound those little ones thus awfully bereaved. One\r\nday the confessor met the prisoners with beaming face, holding in his\r\nhand a letter. It was from the Dowager Marchioness of Queensbury, to\r\nthe condemned Irishmen in Salford gaol, and ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    MY DEAR FRIENDS--\r\n\r\n    It may be that those few lines may minister some consolation\r\n    to you on your approaching departure from this world. I send\r\n    you by the hands of a faithful messenger some help for your\r\n    wife, or wives, and children, in their approaching irreparable\r\n    loss, and with the assurance that so long as I live they shall\r\n    be cared for to the utmost of my power.\r\n\r\n    Mr. M'Donnell, the bearer of this for me, will bring me their\r\n    address, and the address of the priest who attends you.\r\n\r\n    It will also be a comfort for your precious souls, to know\r\n    that we remember you here at the altar of God. where the daily\r\n    remembrance of that all-glorious sacrifice on Calvary, for you\r\n    all, is not neglected.\r\n\r\n    We have daily Mass for you here; and if it be so that it\r\n    please the good God to permit you thus to be called to Himself\r\n    on Saturday morning, the precious body and blood of our Lord\r\n    and Saviour and our Friend will be presented for you before\r\n    God, at eight o'clock, on that day--that blood so precious,\r\n    that cleanses from all sin. May your last words and thoughts\r\n    be Jesus. Rest on Him, who is faithful, and willing and\r\n    all-powerful to save. Rest on Him, and on His sacrifice on\r\n    that Cross for you, instead of you, and hear Him say, \"_To-day\r\n    thou shalt be with me in Paradise_.\" Yet will we remember your\r\n    souls constantly at the altar of God, after your departure, as\r\n    well as those whom you leave in life.\r\n\r\n    Farewell! and may Jesus Christ, the Saviour of sinners, save\r\n    us all, and give you His last blessing upon earth, and an\r\n    eternal continuance of it in heaven.\r\n\r\n    CAROLINE QUEENSBURY.\r\n\r\nThis letter enclosed £100. On hearing it read, poor Larkin burst into\r\ntears; the other prisoners also were deeply affected. Surely, never\r\nwas act more noble! Never was woman's sex more exalted--never was\r\nwoman's mission more beautifully exemplified, than by this glorious\r\nact of bravery, tenderness, and generosity.\r\n\r\nTwo days before the fatal 23rd, the calm resignation which the\r\ncondemned by this time enjoyed was once more cruelly disturbed, and\r\nalmost destroyed. Once again the government came to fill their hearts\r\nwith the torturing hope, if not, indeed, the strong conviction, that\r\nafter all, even though it should be at the foot of the gallows, they\r\nwould one and all be reprieved. _Another man of the five included in\r\nthe vitiated verdict was reprieved_--Shore was to have his sentence\r\ncommuted.\r\n\r\nThis second reprieve was the most refined and subtle torture to\r\nmen who had made up their minds for the worst, and who, by God's\r\nstrengthening gracs, had already become, as it were, dead to the\r\nworld. It rendered the execution of the remaining men almost an\r\nimpossibility. Maguire notoriously was innocent even of complicity\r\nin the rescue--the verdict of the sworn jury, concurred in by the\r\n\"learned judge,\" to the contrary notwithstanding. But _Shore_ was\r\n_avowedly a full participator in the rescue_. He was no more, no less,\r\nguilty than Allen, Larkin, O'Brien. In the dock he proudly gloried in\r\nthe fact. What wonder if the hapless three, as yet unrespited, found\r\nthe wild hope of life surging irresistibly through heart and brain!\r\n\r\nTo the eternal honour of the artisans of London be it told, they\r\nsignalized themselves in this crisis by a humanity, a generosity, that\r\nwill not soon be forgotten by Irishmen. At several crowded meetings\r\nthey adopted memorials to the government, praying for the respite\r\nof the condemned Irishmen--or rather, protesting against their\r\ncontemplated execution. These memorials were pressed with a devoted\r\nzeal that showed how deeply the honest hearts of English working-men\r\nwere stirred; but the newspaper press--the \"high class\" press\r\nespecially--the enlightened \"public instructors\"--howled at, reviled,\r\nand decried these demonstrations of humanity. The Queen's officials\r\ntreated the petitions and petitioners with corresponding contempt;\r\nand an endeavour to approach the Sovereign herself, then at Windsor;\r\nresulted in the contumelious rejection from the palace gate of the\r\npetitioners, who were mobbed and hooted by the tradesmen and flunkeys\r\nof the royal household!\r\n\r\nIn Ireland, however, as might be supposed, the respite of Shore was\r\naccepted as settling the question: there would be no execution. On the\r\n21st of November men heard, indeed, that troops were being poured into\r\nManchester, that the streets were being barricaded, that the public\r\nbuildings were strongly guarded, and that special constables were\r\nbeing sworn in by thousands. All this was laughed at as absurd parade.\r\nReady as were Irishmen to credit England with revengeful severity,\r\nthere was, in their opinion, nevertheless, a limit even to that.\r\nTo hang Allen, O'Brien, and Larkin now, on the broken-down verdict,\r\nwould, it was judged, be a measure of outrage which even the fiercest\r\nhater of England would frankly declare too great for her.\r\n\r\nA few there were, however, who did not view the situation thus. They\r\nread in the respite of Shore, _fear_; and they gloomily reflected that\r\njustice or magnanimity towards the weak seldom characterizes those who\r\nexhibit cowardice towards the strong. _Shore was an American._ By this\r\nsimple sentence a flood of light is thrown on the fact of respiting\r\nhim alone amongst the four men admittedly concerned in the rescue.\r\nShore was an American. He had a country to avenge him if legally\r\nslaughtered on a vitiated verdict. To hang _him_ was dangerous; but\r\nas for Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien, _they had no country_ (in the same\r\nsense) to avenge them. America was strong, but Ireland was weak. If\r\nit was deemed dangerous to sport with the life of the American, it was\r\ndeemed safe to be brutal and merciless towards the Irishmen. On these\r\nthe full arrear of British vengeance might be glutted.\r\n\r\nBut there were not many to discern, in the first flush of its\r\nproclamation, this sinister aspect of Shore's respite. The news\r\nreached Ireland on Friday, 22nd November, and was, as we have already\r\nsaid, generally deemed conclusive evidence that the next day would\r\nbring like news in reference to Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning--Saturday, 23rd November, 1867--men poured into the\r\ncities and towns of Ireland reached by telegraphic communication, to\r\nlearn \"the news from Manchester.\" Language literally fails to convey\r\nan idea of the horror--the stupefaction--that ensued when that news\r\nwas read:--\r\n\r\n\"_This morning, at eight o'clock, the three condemned Fenians, Allen,\r\nLarkin, and O'Brien, were executed in front of Sulford Gaol._\"\r\n\r\nMen gasped in awe-struck horror--speech seemed denied them. Could it\r\nbe a dream, or was this a reality? Had men lived to see the day when\r\nsuch a deed could be done? For the reason that incredulity had been\r\nso strong before, wild, haggard horror now sat on every countenance,\r\nand froze the life-blood in every heart. Irishmen had lain quiescent,\r\npersuaded that in this seventh decade of the nineteenth century, some\r\nhumanizing influences would be found to sway that power that in the\r\npast, at least, had ever been so merciless to Irish victims. But now!\r\nAlas!--\r\n\r\nIn that dreadful hour the gulf between the two nations seemed widened\r\nand deepened, until it gaped and yawned wide, deep, and dark as hell\r\nitself. There was a scowl on every brow. Men went about--sullen,\r\nmoody, silent, morose--with clenched teeth and darkened faces,\r\nterrible passions raging in their bosoms. For all knew that the\r\nsacrifice of those three Irish patriots was a cold-blooded and\r\ncowardly act of English policy, more than a judicial proceeding--an\r\nact of English panic, cowardice, hate, and terror. All knew that\r\nAllen, Larkin, and O'Brien would never have been hanged on the\r\nevidence of those forsworn witnesses, and on the verdict of that jury\r\nwhose perjury or blunder was openly confessed and proclaimed, but for\r\nthe political aspirations and designs of which the rescue was judged\r\nto be an illustration. Had their offence been non-political, they\r\nwould not have been held a day on such a verdict. They were put\r\nto death for their political opinions. They were put to death for\r\npolitical reasons. Their execution was meant to strike terror into\r\nIrishmen daring to mutter of liberty. Had they been Americans, like\r\nShore, they would have been respited; but as they were Irishmen, they\r\nwere immolated.\r\n\r\nThe full story of how those patriots met their fate at the last\r\nreached Ireland two days afterwards, and intensified a thousandfold\r\nthe national emotions. Men were alternately melted into tears\r\nor maddened into passion as they read that sad chapter of Irish\r\nmartyrdom.\r\n\r\nEven before the respite of Shore the government had commenced the most\r\nformidable military preparations in view of the bloody act of State\r\npolicy designed for the 23rd. Troops were hurried by rail to all\r\nthe English cities and towns where an \"Irish element\" existed; and\r\nManchester itself resembled a city besieged. The authorities called\r\nfor \"special constables,\" and, partly attracted by the plenteous\r\nsupply of drink and free feeding;[1] and partly impelled by their\r\nsavage fury against the \"Hirish\" or the \"Fenians,\"--suddenly become\r\nconvertible terms with English writers and speakers--a motley mass\r\nof several thousands, mainly belonging to the most degraded of the\r\npopulation, were enrolled. All the streets in the neighbourhood of the\r\nprison were closed against public traffic, were occupied by police or\r\n\"specials,\" and were crossed at close intervals by ponderous wooden\r\nbarriers. Positions commanding the space in front of the scaffold were\r\nstrategetically scanned, \"strengthened,\" and occupied by military. The\r\nscaffold was erected in a space or gap made in the upper part of the\r\nouter or boundary wall of the prison in New Bailey-street. The masonry\r\nwas removed to the width necessary for the scaffold, which was then\r\nprojected over the street, at the outer side of the wall. It was\r\napproached or ascended from the prison yard below, by a long wooden\r\nstair or stepladder, close alongside the wall on the inside. Against\r\nthe wall on the inner side, on either hand of the scaffold, were\r\nerected platforms within about four feet below the wall coping.\r\nThese platforms were filled with soldiers, \"crouching down,\" as the\r\nreporters described, \"with the muzzles of their rifles just resting on\r\nthe top of the wall.\" The space in the street immediately beneath the\r\nscaffold was railed off by a strong wooden barrier, and outside this\r\nbarrier were massed the thousands of police, special constables, and\r\nvolunteers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Manchester papers inform us that the specials were\r\nplentifully fed with hot pork pies and beer _ad libitum_, which seemed\r\nto have a powerful effect in bringing in volunteers from the lower\r\nclasses.]\r\n\r\nOn Friday the doomed men took leave for the last time of the few\r\nrelatives allowed to see them. The parting of Larkin and his family\r\nis described as one of the most agonizing scenes ever witnessed. Poor\r\nAllen, although not quite twenty years of age, was engaged to a young\r\ngirl whom he loved, and who loved him, most devotedly. She was sternly\r\nrefused the sad consolation of bidding him farewell. In the evening\r\nthe prisoners occupied themselves for some time in writing letters,\r\nand each of them drew up a \"declaration,\" which they committed to the\r\nchaplain. They then gave not another thought to this world. From that\r\nmoment until all was over, their whole thoughts were centred in the\r\nsolemn occupation of preparing to meet their Creator. In these last\r\nhours Father Gadd, the prison chaplain, was assisted by the Very\r\nRev. Canon Cantwell and the Rev. Father Quick, whose attentions were\r\nunremitting to the end. From the first the prisoners exhibited a deep,\r\nfervid religious spirit, which could scarcely have been surpassed\r\namong the earliest Christian martyrs. They received Holy Communion\r\nevery alternate morning, and spent the greater part of their time\r\nin spiritual devotion. On Friday evening they were locked up for\r\nthe night at the usual hour,--about half-past six o'clock. In their\r\ncells they spent a long interval in prayer and meditation--disturbed\r\never and anon, alas! by the shouts of brutal laughter and boisterous\r\nchoruses of the mob already assembled outside the prison walls. At\r\nlength the fated three sought their dungeon pallets for the last\r\ntime. \"Strange as it may appear,\" says one of the Manchester papers\r\nchronicling the execution, \"those three men, standing on the brink\r\nof the grave, and about to suffer an ignominious death, _slept\r\nas soundly_ as had been their wont.\" Very \"strange,\" no doubt, it\r\nappeared to those accustomed to see _criminals_ die; but no marvel to\r\nthose who know how innocent men, at peace with God and man, can mount\r\nthe scaffold, and offer their lives a sacrifice for the cause of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nFar differently that night was spent by the thronging countrymen of\r\nBroadhead, who came as to a holiday to see the \"Fenians\" die. Early\r\non the preceding evening crowds had taken up their places wherever the\r\noccupying bodies of military, police, or specials did not prevent; and\r\nthe pictures drawn of their conduct by the newspaper reporters, one\r\nand all, are inexpressibly revolting. It was the usual English crowd\r\nassembled to enjoy an execution. They made the air resound with\r\nlaughter at obscene jokes, shouts, cries and repartees; and chorused\r\nin thousands [beneath the gallows!] snatches of \"comic\" ballads and\r\npot-house songs, varied by verses of \"Rule, Brittania\" and \"God save\r\nthe Queen,\" by way of exultation over the Irish. Once or twice, in\r\nthe early part of the night, the police had to remove the mob from the\r\nportion of the prison nearest the condemned cells, as the shouts and\r\nsongs were painfully disturbing the hapless men engaged at that moment\r\npreparing for eternity.\r\n\r\nSaturday, the 23rd November, dawned misty, murky, dull, and cold over\r\nSalford. During the first hours after the past midnight the weather\r\nhad been clear and frosty, and a heavy hoar covered the ground; but as\r\ndaylight approached, a thick mist or fog crept like a pallid pall over\r\nthe waking city.\r\n\r\nThe condemned were roused from sound and tranquil slumbers about a\r\nquarter to five o'clock. Having dressed, they attended Mass, Rev.\r\nCanon Cantwell, Rev. Mr. Gadd, and Rev. Mr. Quick officiating. They\r\nheard this, their last Mass, with a fervour and solemnity which no\r\nwords could describe. The Holy Sacrifice having been offered, the\r\ncondemned and the three priests remained in prayer and spiritual\r\nexercises until seven o'clock, when the prisoners partook of\r\nbreakfast. \"The last preparations,\" says an English eye-witness,\r\n\"were then begun. At twelve minutes to eight o'clock the executioner,\r\nCalcraft, and his assistant, were introduced into the cell in which\r\nthe prisoners were placed, and the process of pinioning their arms\r\nwas gone through. The priests stood by the side of the unhappy men,\r\nadministering the consolations of religion, and exhorting them to\r\nfirmness to meet the last dreadful ordeal. The convicts, at this\r\ntime,\" continues the English reporter, \"manifested a remarkable\r\nfortitude. Not one of them flinched in the least.\"\r\n\r\nThe same eye-witness describes as follows the last act of the tragedy,\r\nwith a brief general sketch of which we commenced this narrative:--\r\n\r\n\"At a quarter to eight o'clock the interior court of the gaol\r\npresented a strange and striking spectacle. Behind the wall in New\r\nBailey-street was erected the long staircase leading to the scaffold,\r\nand by its side were platforms for the use of the military. The fog\r\nwas so dense, that objects could be but faintly distinguished at a\r\ndistance of thirty yards. Suddenly the words of military command\r\nwere heard, and a company of the 72nd Highlanders marched round\r\nthe Roundhouse, and took up a position in line at the foot of the\r\nstaircase. Simultaneously, small detachments of the same regiment\r\nascended to the platform, and crouched there, with their loaded rifles\r\nslightly projecting over the prison wall. At almost the same moment\r\nthe heads of a line of soldiers arose above the parapet of the railway\r\nviaduct. A line of warders was formed in the gaol court. The sentries\r\non duty ceased their walk; magistrates and reporters stood aside, and\r\na dead silence prevailed for a few moments, as a signal was given from\r\nthe corner of the Roundhouse. At three minutes past eight o'clock the\r\nsolemn voice of a minister repeating the litany of the Catholic Church\r\nwas heard, and the head of the procession became visible through a\r\nthick fog, about thirty yards from the foot of the staircase. The\r\nRev. Canon Cantwell walked first by the side of Allen. The convict\r\nwas deadly pale; his eyes wandered alternately from the priest to the\r\nindividuals standing round, and then he uplifted his gaze, in a vain\r\nendeavour to pierce the dense canopy which hung above him. He walked\r\nwith a tolerably steady step, and uttered the response, 'Lord, have\r\nmercy upon us,' in a firm voice.\"\r\n\r\nNext to him came Larkin, in whose appearance confinement and anxiety\r\nof mind had wrought a striking change. His physical strength seemed\r\nshaken, and he required to be assisted by one of the warders in\r\nascending the long wooden stair that led to the scaffold. Last of\r\nall came O'Brien, whose noble, firm, and dignified bearing won the\r\napprobation of everyone who beheld him. A partition running in the\r\nline of the wall divided the scaffold into an outer and an inner\r\nplatform, a small door opening between them. Allen and O'Brien, and\r\ntheir attendants, having reached the top of the stair, waited on the\r\ninner platform until Larkin and the rest of the attendant warders and\r\nofficials came up. Then, all being ready, the door was flung open,\r\nand the boy-martyr was first led out upon the drop. His face, which\r\nwas deathly pale, appeared working with the effects of strong mental\r\nagony. The high priest of English rule over Irishmen, Calcraft, came\r\nforward, placed the treacherous noose around Allen's neck, pulled a\r\nthin white cap over his ashen face, and then stooped, and securely\r\ntied his feet together. The pinioning of the arms, which had been done\r\nin the cell, allowed his hands, from the elbows downward, sufficient\r\nfreedom to clasp on his breast a crucifix, which ever and anon, as he\r\nspoke aloud the responses of the litany, the poor young fellow seemed\r\nto press closer and closer to his heart.\r\n\r\nNext O'Brien was led forth. On his fine manly face the closest\r\nscrutiny could not detect a trace of weakness. He looked calmly\r\nand sadly around; then, stepping up to where Allen stood capped and\r\npinioned, he clasped him by the hand, and kissed him affectionately on\r\nthe cheek, speaking to him a word or two not overheard. Then O'Brien\r\nhimself was placed by Calcraft on the drop, the rope was fixed upon\r\nhis neck, the cap was drawn on his face, and his feet were securely\r\nbound.\r\n\r\nLarkin was now brought out, and led directly to his place on the\r\nleft hand of O'Brien, who was in the middle. The sight of his two\r\nbrother-martyrs capped and pinioned, and with the fatal cord around\r\neach neck, seemed to unman the poor fellow utterly. He stumbled on\r\ntouching an uneven plank on the scaffold, so that many thought he had\r\nfainted; but it was not so, though he unquestionably was labouring\r\nunder intense agony of mind. O'Brien, firm and unshrinking to the\r\nlast, turned and looked at him encouragingly, and to him also spoke\r\na few words in a low tone.\r\n\r\nCalcraft now disappeared from view, and the three men stood for a\r\nmoment before the multitude, their voices ringing out clearly in the\r\nstill morning air, \"Lord Jesus, have mercy on us.\" Suddenly the click\r\nof the bolts was heard; the three bodies sunk through the traps;\r\nEngland's three halters strained, and tugged, and twitched\r\nconvulsively for a few moments, and the deed was done--her vengeance\r\nwas accomplished.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon, her functionaries bore to three grave-pits in the\r\nprison-yard three lumps of lifeless clay, that a few short hours\r\nbefore had been three of God's noblest creatures. Like carrion, they\r\nwere flung into those unconsecrated pits, and strewed with quicklime.\r\nFor this was British law. The wolf and the tiger leave some vestiges\r\nof their victims; but a special ordinance of English law required even\r\nthe corpses of those martyred Irishmen to be calcined.\r\n\r\nThey had purposed addressing the crowd from the scaffold, but were\r\nprevented from so doing by order of the government! They had each one,\r\nhowever, committed to writing, as already mentioned, a last solemn\r\nmessage to the world. These declarations of the dying men were\r\nentrusted to the care of their confessor, who eventually gave them up\r\nfor publication. They created the most intense and painful sensation\r\nin Ireland. They made more and more clear the, dreadful fact that\r\nthe hapless men had been cruelly sacrificed. Standing, as it might\r\nbe said, in the presence of their God and Judge, they one and all\r\nprotested their innocence, and declared the falseness of the evidence\r\non which they had been convicted. But not in querulous repining or\r\ndenunciation were these truths proclaimed, but in language and with\r\nsentiments worthy of men who professed the faith preached by the\r\nCrucified on Calvary. Every line breathed the purest humility, the\r\nmost perfect resignation, and the most intense devotion to God,\r\nmingled with the most fervent love of country. Those men were all of\r\nhumble circumstances in life, and, with the exception of O'Brien, had\r\nbut slight literary advantages; yet the simple pathos, beauty, and\r\neloquence of their dying messages moved every heart. Poor Larkin was,\r\nof all three, the least endowed with education, yet his letter has\r\nbeen aptly described as \"a perfect _poem_ in prose.\" here append those\r\nmemorable documents:--\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF WILLIAM PHILIP ALLEN.\r\n\r\nI wish to say a few words relative to the charge for which I am to\r\ndie. In a few hours more I will be going before my God. I state in\r\nthe presence of that great God that I am not the man who shot Sergeant\r\nBrett. If that man's wife is alive, never let her think that I am the\r\nperson who deprived her of her husband; and if his family is alive,\r\nlet them never think I am the man who deprived them of their father.\r\n\r\nI confess I have committed other sins against my God, and I hope He\r\nwill accept of my death as a homage and adoration which I owe his\r\nDivine Majesty, and in atonement for my past transgressions against\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThere is not much use in dwelling on this subject much longer; for by\r\nthis time I am sure it is plain that I am not the man that took away\r\nthe life of Sergeant Brett.\r\n\r\nI state this to put juries on their guard for the future, and to have\r\nthem inquire into the characters of witnesses before they take away\r\nthe lives of innocent men. But then, I ought not to complain. Was\r\nnot our Saviour sold for money, and His life sworn away by false\r\nwitnesses? With the help of the great God, I am only dying to a world\r\nof sorrow to rise to a world of joy. Before the judgment seat of God\r\nthere will be no false witnesses tolerated; everyone must render an\r\naccount for himself.\r\n\r\nI forgive all the enemies I ever may have had in this world. May God\r\nforgive them. Forgive them, sweet Jesus, forgive them! I also ask\r\npardon of all whom I have injured in any way.\r\n\r\nIn reference to the attack on the van, I confess I nobly aided in the\r\nrescue of the gallant Colonel Kelly and Captain Deasey. It is well\r\nknown to the whole world what my poor country has to suffer, and how\r\nher sons are exiles the world over; then tell me where is the Irishman\r\nwho could look on unmoved, and see his countrymen taken prisoners, and\r\ntreated like murderers and robbers in British dungeons?\r\n\r\nMay the Lord have mercy on our souls, and deliver Ireland from her\r\nsufferings. God save Ireland!\r\n\r\nWILLIAM PHILIP ALLEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF MICHAEL LARKIN.\r\n\r\nMen of the World--I, as a dying man, going before my God, solemnly\r\ndeclare I have never fired a shot in all my life, much less the day\r\nthe attack was made on the van, nor did I ever put a hand to the van.\r\nThe world will remember the widow's son's life that was sworn away,\r\nby which he leaves a wife and four children to mourn a loss. I am\r\nnot dying for shooting Brett, but for mentioning Colonel Kelly's and\r\nDeasey's names in the court. I am dying a patriot for my God and my\r\ncountry, and Larkin will be remembered in time to come by the sons and\r\ndaughters of Erin.\r\n\r\nFarewell, dear Ireland, for I must leave you, and die a martyr for\r\nyour sake. Farewell, dear mother, wife, and children, for I must leave\r\nyou all for poor Ireland's sake. Farewell, uncles, aunts, and cousins,\r\nlikewise sons and daughters of Erin. I hope in heaven we will meet\r\nanother day. God be with you. Father in heaven, forgive those that\r\nhave sworn my life away. I forgive them and the world. God bless\r\nIreland!\r\n\r\nMICHAEL LARKIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLARATION OF MICHAEL O'BRIEN.\r\n\r\nI have only to make these few remarks. I did not use a revolver or\r\nany other firearm, or throw stones, on the day that Colonel Kelly and\r\nCaptain Deasey were so gallantly rescued. I was not present too, when\r\nthe van was attacked. I say this not by way of reproach, or to give\r\nannoyance to any person; but I say it in the hope that witnesses may\r\nbe more particular when identifying, and that juries may look more\r\nclosely to the character of witnesses, and to their evidence, before\r\nthey convict a person to send him before his God. I trust that\r\nthose who swore to seeing me with a revolver, or throwing stones,\r\nwere nothing more than mistaken. I forgive them from my heart, and\r\nlikewise, I forgive all who have ever done me or intended to do me\r\nany injury. I know I have been guilty of many sins against my God; in\r\nsatisfaction for those sins I have tried to do what little penance I\r\ncould, and having received the sacraments of the Church, I have humbly\r\nbegged that He would accept my sufferings and death, to be united\r\nto the sufferings and death of His innocent Son, through whom my\r\nsufferings can be rendered acceptable.\r\n\r\nMy Redeemer died a more shameful death, as far as man could make it,\r\nthat I might receive pardon from Him and enjoy His glory in Heaven.\r\nGod grant it may be so. I earnestly beg my countrymen in America to\r\nheal their differences, to unite in God's name for the sake of Ireland\r\nand liberty. I cannot see any reason, even the slightest, why John\r\nSavage should not have the entire confidence of all his countrymen.\r\nWith reference to Colonel Kelly, I believe him to be a good, honorable\r\nman, unselfish, and entirely devoted to the cause of Irish freedom.\r\n\r\nMICHAEL O'BRIEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo ends the story of the memorable events which gave three new names\r\nto the list of Ireland's martyrs; so closes the sad and thrilling\r\nrecord which tells how Allen, Larkin, and O'Brien died. Over the\r\nneglected plot in which their calcined remains are lying no stone\r\nstands inscribed with their names--no emblem to symbolize their\r\nreligion or their nationality. But to that gloomy spot the hearts of\r\nthe Irish people will ever turn with affectionate remembrance; and the\r\nday will never come when, in this the land that bore them, the brave\r\nmen whose ashes repose within it will be forgotten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUISE OF THE JACKNELL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was wild commotion among the Irish people in America, when, on\r\nthe 6th of March, 1867, the Atlantic cable flashed across to them\r\nthe news that on the previous night the Fenian circles, from Louth\r\nto Kerry, had turned out in arms, and commenced the long promised\r\nrebellion. It was news to send a thrill of excitement through every\r\nIrish heart--to fire the blood of the zealous men, who for years had\r\nbeen working to bring the Irish question to this issue; and news to\r\ncause profound and anxious thought to that large class of Irishmen\r\nwho, deeply occupied with commercial and professional pursuits, are\r\nless energetic than the members of the Fenian Brotherhood in their\r\npolitical action, but who scarcely differ from them in principle. It\r\nwas, for all who had Irish blood in their veins and Irish sympathies\r\nin their hearts, a serious consideration that once again the banner\r\nof insurrection against English rule had been unfurled in Ireland,\r\nand that on many a spot of Irish earth the organized forces of England\r\nwere in conflict with the hastily collected, ill-supplied, and almost\r\nunarmed levies of Irish patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe question whether the cause of Ireland would be advantaged or\r\ninjured by the struggle and its inevitable results, was differently\r\nanswered by different minds. Some saw in the conflict nothing but\r\ndefeat and suffering for the country--more, gyves and chains--more,\r\nsorrow and humiliation for her sons, and a fresh triumph for the proud\r\nand boastful power of England. Others, while only too well convinced\r\nthat the suppression of the insurrectionary movement was sure to be\r\nspeedily accomplished, viewed the position with a certain fierce and\r\nstern satisfaction, and discerned therein the germ of high hopes for\r\nthe future.\r\n\r\nBut to certain of the Fenian leaders and Fenian circles in America,\r\nthe news came with a pressing and a peculiar interest. They were\r\nlargely responsible for the outbreak; the war was, in a manner, their\r\nwar. Their late head-centre, James Stephens, was chargeable with it\r\nonly in a certain degree. He had promised to initiate the struggle\r\nbefore the 1st of January of that year. Conscious that his veracity\r\nwas regarded in somewhat of a dubious light by many of his followers,\r\nhe reiterated the declaration with all possible passion and vehemence,\r\nand even went the length of swearing to it by invocations of the Most\r\nHigh, before public assemblies of his countrymen. When the time came\r\nfor the fulfilment of his pledges he failed to keep them, and was\r\nimmediately deposed from his position by the disappointed and enraged\r\ncircles which had hitherto trusted him. But in the meantime, relying\r\non his engagement to lead off an insurrection in Ireland, those\r\ncircles had made certain preparations for the event, and a number of\r\ntheir members, brave Irishmen who had had actual experience of war in\r\nthe armies of America, had crossed the Atlantic, and landed in England\r\nand Ireland, to give the movement the benefit of their services. To\r\nthese men the break-down of James Stephens was a stunning blow, an\r\nevent full of shame and horror; they felt their honour compromised\r\nby his conduct; they considered that they could not return to America\r\nwith their mission unattempted, and they resolved to establish their\r\nown honesty and sincerity at all events, as well as the courage\r\nand earnestness of the Fenian Brotherhood in Ireland, by taking the\r\ndesperate course of engaging forthwith in open insurrection. It was\r\nin conformity with their arrangements, and in obedience to their\r\ndirections, that the rising took place on the night of the 5th of\r\nMarch, 1867.\r\n\r\nThe ill success which attended the attempted insurrection was reported\r\nin America almost as soon as it was known in Ireland, by the agency\r\nof the Atlantic telegraph. But, whoever believed the statements of its\r\nspeedy and utter collapse, which were forwarded through the cable, the\r\nFenian circles certainly did not. They felt certain that the truth was\r\nbeing withheld from them, that the cable, which was an instrument in\r\nthe hands of the British Government, was being employed to mislead\r\nthem, and that when it reported all quiet in Ireland, and no movement\r\nafoot save that of the British troops employed in \"scouring\" the\r\nmountains of Cork and Tipperary, there was, in reality, a guerilla\r\nwarfare being waged over a great extent of the country, and many\r\na tough fight being fought in pass, and glen, and wood, amidst the\r\npicturesque scenery of the Munster counties. Their incredulity was but\r\nnatural. They had no reason whatever to rely on the truthfulness of\r\nthe cable messages. If there had been Fenian successes to report, it\r\nis very likely that no fair account of them would have been allowed\r\nto pass by that route. Still, as day after day went by, and brought\r\nno news of battles lost or won by any party, the conviction began to\r\nforce itself on the minds of the American Fenians that the movement\r\nin Ireland was hanging fire, and that it was going hard with the brave\r\nmen who had committed themselves to it at the outset. It was necessary\r\nthat something should be done, if those men were to be sustained, and\r\nthe outbreak developed into a struggle worthy of the cause, and of the\r\nlong years of preparation, the bold threats and the glowing promises\r\nof the Fenian Brotherhood, the risks they had incurred, and the\r\nsacrifices they had made.\r\n\r\nWhat was to be done? What was most needed to give force and power to\r\nthe insurrectionary uprising in Ireland? They knew the answer. Arms\r\nand officers were wanted. To supply them, at least in some measure,\r\nwas, therefore, the great object that now presented itself to their\r\nminds. How they sought to accomplish it is known to the public--if the\r\nAttorney-General and his witnesses, at the opening of the Commission\r\nin Dublin, in November, 1867, told a true story.\r\n\r\nAny references we shall here make to that particular subject, that is,\r\nto the alleged voyage of a Fenian cruiser conveying men and arms from\r\nNew York to Ireland, shall be derived entirely from the statements\r\nmade in open court on that occasion, with an extract or two from a\r\ndocument otherwise published. We shall add nothing to them, neither\r\nshall we vouch for the authenticity of all or any of them, for, at\r\nthe time of our writing, \"the Crown,\" as the government lawyers call\r\nthemselves, are not yet done with some of the cases arising out of\r\nthis alleged expedition. But, taking the narrative as we find it\r\nin the newspaper reports of the trials of Colonel John Warren and\r\nAugustine E. Costello, and in the lecture delivered in America, under\r\nthe auspices of the Fenian Brotherhood, by Colonel S.R. Tresilian,\r\nJohn Savage, Esq., C.E.F.B. in the chair, reported in the _Irish\r\nPeople_, New York, and in other journals, we summarise briefly, as\r\nfollows, its chief particulars.\r\n\r\nIt appears, then, that at the time to which we have referred, when the\r\nnecessity of transmitting a quantity of arms, and sending a number of\r\nmilitary leaders to Ireland for the sustainment of the insurrectionary\r\nmovement had impressed itself on the minds of the Fenian leaders\r\nin America, they resolved on an attempt to supply, to some extent,\r\nthose requirements. Two ways were open to them of setting about this\r\ndifficult and hazardous undertaking. One was to avail of the ordinary\r\nmail steamers and trading ships between the two countries, send the\r\nmen across as ordinary passengers, and ship the arms as goods of\r\ndifferent kinds. Much had been done in that way during the previous\r\nthree or four years, but it was plainly too slow and uncertain a\r\nprocess to adopt on the present occasion. The other course was to\r\nprocure a vessel for this special purpose, freight her with the men\r\nand arms, place her under the command of a skilful and experienced\r\ncaptain, and trust to his skill and luck for landing the entire in\r\nsafety somewhere on the west coast of Ireland.\r\n\r\nThis was the course adopted. How it was carried out, the\r\nAttorney-General, with whatever degree of authority may attach to his\r\nwords in such a case, has thus described:--\r\n\r\n    On the 12th of April, 1867, a party of forty or fifty men,\r\n    almost all of whom had been officers or privates in the\r\n    service of the American government, went down from New York to\r\n    Sandyhook, in a steamer, a distance of about eighteen miles.\r\n    There they found a brigantine of about 200 tons burden, which\r\n    had been purchased for the expedition, and in that brigantine\r\n    these men embarked, and sailed for Ireland. She was called the\r\n    \"Jacknell,\" and she sailed without papers or colours. For the\r\n    purpose of keeping their movements as free from observation\r\n    as possible, these men embarked without luggage--a rather\r\n    extraordinary thing in men the great majority of whom had\r\n    been officers in the American service. The commander of the\r\n    expedition was named John F. Kavanagh, and he had filled the\r\n    office of brigadier-general in the American army, and was at\r\n    one time a member of the American Congress. These men had on\r\n    board a very large quantity of arms, packed in piano-cases,\r\n    cases for sewing machines, and wine barrels, in order to\r\n    conceal them effectually; and the parcels were consigned to\r\n    a merchant firm in Cuba. The ship steered for one day towards\r\n    the West Indies, in order to avoid suspicion, and then shaped\r\n    her course towards Ireland. Vessels occasionally came in\r\n    sight, and when they did English colours were hoisted. Nothing\r\n    remarkable occurred until Easter Sunday, April 29th, nearly\r\n    nine days after they had sailed from New York. The parties\r\n    determined to celebrate that day as a festival, and they\r\n    hoisted the green flag with a sunburst, fired a salute, and\r\n    changed the name of the vessel, calling her \"Erin's Hope.\"\r\n    Kavanagh then produced Fenian commissions, and distributed\r\n    them, and also produced sealed orders, from which it appeared\r\n    that he was to sail to Sligo Bay, and there land his men and\r\n    arms; and if he found it impracticable to land them there,\r\n    he was to proceed to some other place in Ireland. Some days\r\n    after this, they came in sight of the coast of the county\r\n    of Limerick, and then they sailed towards Sligo; but they\r\n    overshot the mark, and arrived off the coast of Donegal. They\r\n    then turned back, and arrived at Sligo Bay on the 20th of May.\r\n\r\nThe learned gentleman then went on to describe certain occurrences\r\nalleged to have taken place on board the vessel, while she remained\r\nin and about Sligo Bay. He said that on one evening a hooker came\r\nalongside, from which a man, who appeared to be a gentleman, got on\r\nboard the brigantine. This person went down into the cabin, conversed\r\nwith the officers, and told them the landing could not be effected at\r\nSligo, after which he returned on board the hooker, and sailed for the\r\nshore. The Attorney-General said:--\r\n\r\n    About the 26th of May the ship left the Sligo coast. On the\r\n    1st of June she arrrivcd at Dungarvan. During the voyage\r\n    councils were held on board. Provisions were running short,\r\n    and they could not remain much longer at sea. These matters\r\n    were made the subjects of discussion. Some were for going to\r\n    America, and some for landing; and at last the conclusion was\r\n    arrived at that the majority of the officers should be landed,\r\n    and that the others should go either to America or to the\r\n    Western Isles--the Hebrides. They hailed a large fishing boat,\r\n    and offered the man on board £2 to put two men on shore. He\r\n    went on board the brigantine, and when he did so, twenty-eight\r\n    men who were hitherto concealed, rushed on board his ship. He\r\n    asked them if he would land them at Helwick Point, and they\r\n    said no, because there was a coastguard station there. They\r\n    were eventually landed about two miles from that point, and\r\n    they were compelled to wade through water three-and-a-half\r\n    feet deep to the shore.\r\n\r\nSo far the learned gentleman, her Majesty's Attorney-General for\r\nIreland. His statement was supported by the informations and\r\nthe evidence of an informer, Daniel J. Buckley, the Judas of the\r\nexpedition. He, however, represented Kavanagh as the captain of\r\nthe vessel, and General James E. Kerrigan as chief of the military\r\nexpedition. As to the armament on board, they had, he said, \"some\r\nSpencer's repeating rifles, seven-shooters, and some Enfield rifles,\r\nAustrian rifles, Sharp's and Burnside's breech-loaders, and some\r\nrevolvers. There were about 5,000 stand of arms on board, and three\r\npieces of artillery, which would fire three-pound shot or shell. With\r\nthese pieces the salute was fired on the occasion of hoisting the\r\nsunburst on Easter Sunday. As regards ammunition, there were about a\r\nmillion-and-a-half rounds on board.\"\r\n\r\nColonel S.R. Tresilian, in the lecture already alluded to, gave the\r\nfollowing facetious account of the warlike stores which were on board\r\nthe vessel:--\r\n\r\n    We found the cargo to consist of 5,000 rat-tail files, of\r\n    different sizes and descriptions. Then there were several\r\n    smaller files that mechanics carry in their pockets; then\r\n    again there was the flat file, in respectable numbers, that\r\n    are used for cutting on either edge, and that are carried\r\n    in sheathes, to prevent the mechanics from cutting their\r\n    neighbours' fingers. These files were to be distributed to the\r\n    paupers in Ireland, to enable them to sharpen their teeth, so\r\n    that they could masticate animal food at the grand barbecue\r\n    that was to be given on the landing of our vessel. Another\r\n    portion of the cargo was 200,000 puff-balls and sugar-plums,\r\n    for gratuitous distribution among our English friends and\r\n    brethren in Ireland.\r\n\r\nIt surely was a daring venture to run that craft, freighted as she\r\nwas, across the ocean, and sail her for days along the coast of\r\nIreland. The lecturer gave the following account of her voyagings:--\r\n\r\n    The craft made three landings in Ireland, and one in England,\r\n    and they were very near being captured several times. At no\r\n    time were they over twelve miles from a British man-of-war,\r\n    a frigate, ram, or gun-boat, and were continually annoyed by\r\n    pilots. They were at sea 107 days; 38 days from America to\r\n    Ireland, in which, they sailed 3,565 miles; 24 days round\r\n    the coast of Ireland and England, 2,023 miles; 47 days from\r\n    Ireland to America, 3,577 miles; making a grand total of 9,205\r\n    miles.\r\n\r\nAs regards the return voyage, the lecturer gave the following\r\ninformation:--\r\n\r\n    On the return trip they had, in starting from the coast of\r\n    Ireland, one barrel sound bread, one barrel mouldy bread,\r\n    one rice, pork 6 lbs., one box fish, one barrel of beef, one\r\n    bushel of beans, two quarts of molasses, one-half lb. sugar,\r\n    tea and coffee in sufficient quantities, one-third rations\r\n    of water. They ran out of everything except bread and water\r\n    before reaching the Banks of Newfoundland, where they received\r\n    assistance from a fishing-smack, and again, off Boston, from\r\n    a vessel bound to San Francisco. They succeeded in landing the\r\n    entire cargo safely in America, and it is now in the hands of\r\n    the Fenian Brotherhood.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange story altogether. The voyage of the vessel to and fro,\r\nand along the well-watched coast of Ireland, unchallenged by a British\r\nship, is a fact of no small significance, even if it be not quite\r\nconclusive as regards the argument of the lecturer, that the Fenian\r\nBrotherhood of America can, when they please, land large supplies, men\r\nand arms, in Ireland. Then the interest of the narrative is greatly\r\nenhanced by some of its romantic incidents, more especially by the\r\nremarkable scene stated to have occurred on Easter Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nNews of the landing which had been effected near Dungarvan was\r\nquickly spread amongst the coastguards and the police, and a few\r\nhours afterwards some twenty-seven men were under arrest, charged with\r\nhaving come into the country under suspicious circumstances. Amongst\r\nthem were two whose trials for having formed part of an armed\r\nexpedition destined to aid a rebellion in Ireland, have since been\r\nhad at the Commission which opened in Dublin on the 28th of November,\r\n1867, and whose spirited defence of themselves in the dock it is our\r\npurpose to record in these pages. They were Colonel John Warren, of\r\nthe American army, and Augustine E. Costello.\r\n\r\nThe trial of the first-named of those gentlemen is likely, owing\r\nto the spirited and statesmanlike course which he adopted on the\r\noccasion, to become memorable for all time, and to have a prominent\r\nplace in the histories of two great nations, England and America. One\r\nof its results, now actually in progress, is an alteration in the law\r\nof America, on a point of great importance to both countries; and this\r\nalteration will necessitate a corresponding change, if not in the law,\r\nat least in the practice, of the English courts. From these changes\r\nwill ensue consequences of the utmost gravity to England, but of\r\nunquestionable advantage to the Irish people, and the cause which they\r\nhave at heart; for all which the name of Colonel Warren will long be\r\nheld in honour and in grateful remembrance among his countrymen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLONEL WARREN]\r\n\r\nColonel Warren, who is a native of the town of Clonakilty, in the\r\ncounty of Cork, and of respectable parentage, emigrated to the United\r\nStates some twelve years ago, and in due course of time, like most\r\nof his countrymen who transfer their domicile to that free and great\r\ncountry, he took out papers of naturalization, and became one of its\r\nadopted citizens. That act of naturalization is the declaration of\r\na contract between the American government, on the one hand, and\r\nthe new-made citizen on the other, whereby the latter formally and\r\nsolemnly transfers his allegiance to that government, and withdraws\r\nit from any other which might previously have had a claim on it; and\r\nwhereby the government, on its part, in exchange for that allegiance,\r\nengages to extend to him all the liberties and rights possessed by its\r\nnative-born subjects--the benefit of its laws, the full scope of its\r\nfranchises, the protection of its flag. In this way many hundreds\r\nof thousands of men, hunted by British law and British policy out of\r\nIreland, have, during recent years, been added to the number of brave\r\nand devoted citzens possessed by the United States. But yet, it\r\nseems, the law of England affords no recognition to this transfer of\r\nallegiance, expressly denies the legality of any such act, and claims\r\nas subjects of the British crown, not only all persons born within\r\nBritish jurisdiction, but also their sons and grandsons, wherever\r\ntheir domicile and their place of birth may be. Between the\r\nBritish law on the subject of allegiance and the American system of\r\nnaturalization, there is, therefore, an irreconcilable discrepancy;\r\nand the course taken by Colonel Warren, on his trial, was to bring\r\nthis question of law between the two governments to a direct issue.\r\nHe took his stand on his American citizenship; he claimed to be tried\r\nas an alien, and, on the bench refusing to accede to his demand, he\r\nabandoned all legal defence, directed his counsel to withdraw from\r\nthe case, and put it upon his government to maintain the honour and\r\nvindicate the laws of America, by affording him the protection to\r\nwhich he was entitled.\r\n\r\nOther Irishmen, naturalized citizens of America, had previously been\r\ntried and sentenced for Fenian practices, including acts done and\r\nwords spoken by them in America, which would not have come within the\r\ncognizance of the court had they been tried otherwise than as British\r\nsubjects; and in their addresses to the court they had made reference,\r\nproudly and hopefully, to the fact that they were adopted sons of\r\nthat great country; but none of them had struck upon a course so well\r\ncalculated as that taken by Colonel Warren to raise the international\r\nquestion, and necessitate a distinct and speedy solution of it. He\r\nhad a good case to go before the jury, had he allowed himself to be\r\nlegally defended, and he was perfectly aware of that fact; but he\r\nclearly perceived that, by taking the other course, whatever might\r\nbe the consequences to himself, he would be able to render better\r\nservice, both to his adopted country and his native land. He took that\r\ncourse, and it is, therefore, that he is to-day in a British convict\r\nprison, far away from his home and friends, from his wife and his\r\nchildren, subject to all the restraints and indignities imposed by\r\nEngland on the vilest and meanest of her criminals, and with a term of\r\nfifteen years of such treatment decreed to him. Let us be able to say\r\nat least, that his countrymen are not unmindful of the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the trial, which was had before Chief Baron Pigot\r\nand Mr. Justice Keogh, in the Commission Court, Dublin, Colonel Warren\r\noffered some few remarks on the evidence, and put some questions to\r\nthe witnesses, all of which showed considerable acumen on his part,\r\nand were thoroughly _ad rem_. He complained particularly of the manner\r\nin which his identification was obtained. Gallagher, who had piloted\r\nthe \"Erin's Hope\" around the west coast of Ireland, swore to his\r\nidentity as one of the party who were on board; but the prisoner\r\ncontended that Gallagher's knowledge of him was acquired, not on board\r\nthat vessel, but in Kilmainham gaol, where Gallagher had been his\r\nfellow-prisoner for some weeks, during which time he had abundant\r\nopportunities of learning his, Colonel Warren's, name, and the\r\ncharge against him. But it was a vain thing, as far as the jury were\r\nconcerned, to indulge in such criticisms of the evidence. There were\r\ntimes in Irish and in English history, when juries could rise above\r\nthe panic of the hour, and refuse to minister to the passion of the\r\ngovernment, but we have fallen upon other times, and, now-a-days, to\r\nbe accused of a political crime means to be convicted.\r\n\r\nA verdict of \"guilty\" against Colonel Warren was returned as a\r\nmatter of course. On Saturday, November the 16th, he, with two other\r\nprisoners, was brought up for sentence. On the usual interrogatory\r\nbeing put to him, the following proceedings took place:--\r\n\r\n    I claim the privilege established by precedent. I have had no\r\n    opportunity of making any remarks on my case, and I would now\r\n    wish to say a few words.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--Just state what you have to say; we are ready\r\n    to hear you.\r\n\r\n    WARREN--I desire, in the first place, to explain, while\r\n    ignoring the jurisdiction of this court to sentence me,\r\n    and while assuming my original position, my reasons for\r\n    interfering in this case at all. I can see beyond my present\r\n    position, the importance of this case, and I was desirous\r\n    to instruct the jury, either directly or indirectly, of\r\n    the importance of their decision, while never for a moment\r\n    deviating from the position which I assumed. I submit that\r\n    I effectually did that. They incautiously, and foolishly for\r\n    themselves and the country of which they claim to be subjects,\r\n    have raised an issue which has to be settled by a higher\r\n    tribunal than this court.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--I propose to show that the verdict is contrary to\r\n    evidence.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I must again tell you that you are not at\r\n    liberty to do that.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--I propose to answer briefly the question why the\r\n    sentence of the court should not be pronounced upon me. Do I\r\n    understand you to refuse me that privilege?\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--Certainly not; but I am bound in point of law\r\n    to refuse to hear you upon any matter respecting the verdict.\r\n    We are bound by that verdict just as much as you are. That is\r\n    the law.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--What position do I stand in now, my lord? I have\r\n    been indicted with a number of parties, one of whom had been\r\n    identified in America. I have been tried and convicted. What\r\n    position do I stand in now? Am I convicted on the evidence of\r\n    Corydon, who swears that I belonged to the Fenian Brotherhood\r\n    in 1863? Does that prove that I belonged to it in 1867?\r\n\r\nThe Chief Baron then explained that what he left to the jury was,\r\nthat if they believed upon the evidence that on the 5th of March the\r\nprisoner belonged to the Fenian confederacy, having for its object the\r\ndeposition of the Queen, he would be answerable for the acts done by\r\nhis confederates, whether he was present or absent at the time.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--You instructed the jury, at the same time, that\r\n    the fact of my holding the position of a colonel in '63 was\r\n    sufficient corroboration of the evidence that I belonged to it\r\n    in 1867.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I told the jury that holding the rank of\r\n    colonel was evidence for their consideration, upon which\r\n    to determine whether you previously belonged to the Fenian\r\n    confederacy. I told them they were at liberty to consider\r\n    whether you would have got that rank if you then joined for\r\n    the first time.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--Precisely the same thing, but in different\r\n    phraseology. Am I to understand that I have not liberty to\r\n    address the court as to why sentence should not be pronounced\r\n    upon me?\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--You are not so to consider. You are at\r\n    liberty to address the court, but you are not at liberty to\r\n    comment upon the evidence to show that the verdict was wrong.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--What can I speak on? To what can I speak, if not to\r\n    something connected with my case? I am not here to refer to a\r\n    church matter or any political question.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I have informed you what we are bound to\r\n    rule.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--Then I state, my lord, that as an American citizen,\r\n    I protest against the whole jurisdiction of this court, from\r\n    the commencement of my arraignment down to the end of my\r\n    trial. I protest against being brought here forcibly, and\r\n    against my being convicted on the evidence of a man whom you\r\n    yourselves designated a man of the most odious character.\r\n    You instructed the jury pointedly on one occasion, and\r\n    subsequently you said that no respectable jury could act on\r\n    his evidence, and that it was a calamity for any government,\r\n    to have to resort to the evidence of such a man. I do not wish\r\n    to say anything disrespectful to this eourt, but I think I may\r\n    say that if I stand here as a convicted felon, the privilege\r\n    should be accorded to me that has been accorded to every other\r\n    person who stood here before me in a similar position. There\r\n    is a portion of the trial to which I particularly wish to\r\n    refer. That is, in reference to the oath which it was stated\r\n    the pilot was forced to take on board the vessel. Much\r\n    importance was attached to this matter, and therefore I wish\r\n    to ask you and others in this court to look and to inquire if\r\n    there is any man here who could suppose that I am scoundrel\r\n    enough and ignorant enough to take an ignorant man, put a\r\n    pistol to his face, and force him to take an oath I ask you,\r\n    in the first place, not to believe that I am such a scoundrel,\r\n    and in the second that I am not such an idiot. If I were at\r\n    this moment going to my grave, I could say that I never saw\r\n    that man Gallagher till I saw him in Kilmainham prison. These\r\n    men, although they have been, day after day, studying lessons\r\n    under able masters, contradicted each other on the trial, and\r\n    have been perjuring themselves. Gallagher, in his evidence,\r\n    swore that his first and second informations were false, and\r\n    that he knew them to be false. It is contrary to all precedent\r\n    to convict a man on the evidence of a witness who admits\r\n    that he swore what was false. In America I have seen judges,\r\n    hundreds of times, sentencing men who were taken off the\r\n    table, put into the dock, and sent to prison. In this case,\r\n    this poor, ignorant man was brought into Kilmainham gaol on\r\n    the 1st of July. He knew my name, heard it called several\r\n    times, knew of the act of which I was suspected, and, on the\r\n    2nd of August he was taken away. On the 12th of October he\r\n    is brought back, and out of a party of forty or fifty he\r\n    identifies only three. If that man came on board the vessel,\r\n    he did so in his ordinary capacity as a pilot. He did his\r\n    duty, got his pay, and left. His subsequent evidence was\r\n    additions. With respect to the vessel, I submit that there was\r\n    not a shadow of evidence to prove that there was any intention\r\n    of a hostile landing, and that the evidence as to the identity\r\n    of the vessel would not stand for a moment where either law\r\n    or justice would be regarded. Now, as to the Flying Dutchman\r\n    which it is said appeared on the coast of Sligo and on the\r\n    coast of Dungarvan, in Gallagher's information nothing is said\r\n    about the dimensions of the vessel. Neither length, breadth,\r\n    or tonnage is given, but in making his second information he\r\n    revised the first.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner then proceeded to argue that there was nothing to show\r\nthat the vessel which had appeared in Sligo harbour was the same with\r\nthat which had appeared off Dungarvan, except the testimony of the\r\ninformer, Buckley, of which there was no corroboration. He also denied\r\nthe truth of Corydon's evidence, in several particulars, and then went\r\non to say--\r\n\r\n    As to the position in which I am now placed by British law,\r\n    I have to repeat that I am an American citizen, and owe\r\n    allegiance to the government of the United States. I am a\r\n    soldier, and have belonged to the National Militia of America.\r\n    Now, if war had broken out between the two countries, and that\r\n    I had been taken prisoner, the English government, according\r\n    to English law, would hold me guilty of high treason. I would\r\n    not be treated as an ordinary prisoner of war, but would be\r\n    liable to be strung up at the yard arm. See then the position\r\n    of England towards the United States. The Crown should not be\r\n    in such haste to act thus. It was hardly a judicious policy.\r\n    Andrew Johnson was the grandson of an Irishman; Mr. Seward was\r\n    the son of an Irishwoman; General Jackson was the son of an\r\n    Irishman; General Washington and Benjamin Franklin lived\r\n    and died British subjects, if this law be correct. There is\r\n    another point to which I wish to refer--it is to the manner in\r\n    which my government has acted in this matter--\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--We cannot allow you to enter into remarks on\r\n    the conduct of any government. We have simply to sit here to\r\n    administer the law which we are called upon to discharge.\r\n\r\n    THE PRISONER--I wish simply to call your attention to one\r\n    point. On the 3rd of August I wrote to my government--\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to refer to that.\r\n\r\n    THE PRISONER--The President of the United States, on a report\r\n    submitted to him--\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to proceed with any\r\n    reference to what has been done by any government. We have\r\n    nothing to do with the conduct of any government We are only\r\n    here to administer the law which we are sworn to administer.\r\n\r\n    THE PRISONER--I was simply going to state that while the vile\r\n    officials of your government--.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--We have nothing to do with the conduct of any\r\n    government. We are here to dispense justice according to\r\n    law, and whatever the officials of our government or of\r\n    the American government have done cannot have the slightest\r\n    influence upon our judgment. It can neither affect us\r\n    favourably or unfavourably to the prisoner or to the Crown. We\r\n    stand indifferently between both.\r\n\r\n    THE PRISONER--I beg simply to call your lordship's attention\r\n    to the correspondence--\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--We cannot allow you to do so. We cannot allow\r\n    you to refer to the correspondence between the officials of\r\n    one government and the officials of another.\r\n\r\n    THE PRISONER--If America does not resent England's conduct\r\n    towards me, and protect that allegiance to her government\r\n    which I proudly own is the only allegiance I ever\r\n    acknowledged, I shall call on thirteen millions of Irishmen--\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to use the position in\r\n    which you stand there as the arena for those observations.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--I must then state, in conclusion, that while I\r\n    protest against the jurisdiction, I am confident that the\r\n    position which I take will be sustained. I know that the\r\n    verdict of the jury will be reversed, and while returning you,\r\n    my lord, thanks for your kindness during the trial, I must\r\n    say you have taken from me the privilege I am entitled to\r\n    get. I am sure that I shall live longer than the British\r\n    Constitution.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAUGUSTINE E. COSTELLO.\r\n\r\nAfter the verdict had been returned against Colonel Warren, Augustine\r\nE. Costello was put on his trial, charged with the same offence--that\r\nof having formed cne of the invading party who landed from the \"Erin's\r\nHope,\" in the neighbourhood of Dungarvan. He, too, was an adopted\r\ncitizen of the United States, and he declared that he was anxious to\r\nfollow the course that had been taken by his friend, Colonel Warren,\r\nin reference to his trial; but, deferring to the strongly-expressed\r\nwish of his counsel, he would leave his case in their hands. An able\r\ndefence was made for him by Messrs. Heron and Molloy, Q.C., instructed\r\nby Mr. Scallan, Solicitor; but it was all in vain. When he was called\r\non to say why sentence should not be pronounced on him, he delivered\r\nthe following address in a loud tone of voice, his fresh young\r\nface glowing with emotion as he spoke, and his manner showing deep\r\nexcitement, but withal a fearless and noble spirit:--\r\n\r\n    In answer to the question put to me by the Clerk of the Court,\r\n    I will speak a few words. I don't intend to say much, and I\r\n    will trespass on foibidden ground but as little as possible.\r\n    I am perfectly satisfied that there has not been one fact\r\n    established or proved that would justify a conscientious and\r\n    impartial jury in finding me guilty of treason-felony. There\r\n    is an extreme paucity of evidence against me;--that everyone\r\n    who has been here while this case has been proceeded with\r\n    will admit frankly and candidly. We need no stronger proof of\r\n    this fact than that the first jury that was empanelled to try\r\n    me had, after a long and patient hearing of the case, to be\r\n    discharged without having found me guilty of treason-felony.\r\n    Ah! there were a few honest men on that jury. They knew that\r\n    Augustine E. Costello was not guilty of the crime trumped up\r\n    against him. They knew I was not guilty. Mr. Anderson, sitting\r\n    there, knows that I am not a felon, but that I am an honest\r\n    man; that as such I stand here in this dock, where Robert\r\n    Emmett stood, where Robert Emmett spoke from; and the actions\r\n    and the words of that Emmett have immortalized him, and he now\r\n    lies embalmed in the hearts of the world.\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to proceed in that\r\n    strain.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I can say to those assembled here, and who are now\r\n    listening to me, that I stand here, branded, as I am, a felon,\r\n    but with a clear conscience. No one can point the finger of\r\n    scorn against me, and say I have sold my brother and committed\r\n    perjury. Can every man in this court house lay his hand on his\r\n    heart and say the same? Answer me, Mr. Anderson. Answer me,\r\n    Governor Price.\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--You are again transgressing. You had\r\n    better stop for a moment or two; you seem to be excited.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--My lord, as you truly remark. I have allowed my\r\n    feelings to run away with my discretion; but it is hard for\r\n    a man to stand here, satisfied as I am of innocence, knowing\r\n    full well that I have committed no wrong; it is hard for a\r\n    man in the bloom of youth, when the world looks fair and\r\n    prosperous to him--when all he loves is in that world--it is\r\n    hard that a man should be torn from it, and incarcerated in a\r\n    living tomb. My lords, I am an humble individual; I claim no\r\n    rights but the rights that emanated from a Godhead--the rights\r\n    that were given to me at the hour of my birth. That right is\r\n    my inalienable liberty, and that no government, no people,\r\n    has a right to take from me. I am perfectly satisfied to stand\r\n    before a British tribunal to answer for acts or words of mine,\r\n    if I break any of the laws of the country; but, my lords,\r\n    you must admit that I have transgressed no law. His lordship,\r\n    Judge Keogh--I must now candidly admit that I have heard\r\n    a great deal about that gentle nan that was not at all\r\n    complimentary to him--but I say for myself that his lordship,\r\n    Judge Keogh has dealt with me in the fairest manner he could\r\n    have done. I have nothing to say against the administration of\r\n    the law, as laid down by you; but I say a people who boast of\r\n    their freedom--hold up their magnanimous doings to the world\r\n    for approval and praise--I say those people are the veriest\r\n    slaves in existence to allow laws to exist for a moment which\r\n    deprive a man of liberty.\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--It is impossible for a Court\r\n    administering the law, to allow you to speak in such terms\r\n    against such law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Augustine E. Costello.]\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I speak under correction, my lord. You must, if you\r\n    please, be assured that I do not attribute any wrong to\r\n    your lordships--far be it from me; I acknowledge and again\r\n    reiterate that. So far as the law is concerned, I have had a\r\n    dose that has almost killed me; but if there was a little--a\r\n    very little--justice mixed in that law, I would not be now\r\n    addressing your lordships. Of the law I have had sufficient,\r\n    but I have come to the conclusion that justice is not to be\r\n    found inside a British courthouse. My lords, I complain, and\r\n    grievously, of what my friend Colonel Warren and my friend\r\n    General Halpin complained of--of being tried in this Court\r\n    as a British subject; and I think your lordships will not\r\n    reprimand me much for that expression. I left the shores of my\r\n    native land--Ireland is the land of my birth, and I am proud\r\n    to own it. I am proud to say that I am an Irishman, but I am\r\n    also proud and happy to state that I am an adopted citizen of\r\n    the United States; and while true to the land of my birth, I\r\n    can never be false to the land of my adoption. That is not\r\n    an original phrase, but it expresses the idea which I mean to\r\n    convey. Now, my lords, my learned and very able counsel, who\r\n    have conducted my case with the greatest ability and zeal, and\r\n    of whom I cannot speak in terms of sufficient praise, demanded\r\n    for me a jury half alien. I was refased it. I was born in\r\n    this country, and I was, while breath remained in my body, a\r\n    British subject. In God's name--if I may mention His holy name\r\n    without sufficient reasons--what affection should I have for\r\n    England? You cannot stamp out the instincts that are in the\r\n    breast of man--man will be man to the end of time--the very\r\n    worm you tread upon will turn upon your feet. If I remained in\r\n    this country till I descended to the grave, I would remain in\r\n    obscurity and poverty. I left Ireland, not because I disliked\r\n    the country--I love Ireland as I lovs myself--I left Ireland\r\n    for the very good and cogent reason that I could not live in\r\n    Ireland. But why could I not live here? I must not say; that\r\n    would be trespassing. I must not mention why I was forced to\r\n    leave Ireland--why I am now placed in this dock. Think you,\r\n    my lords, that I would injure a living being--that I would,\r\n    of my own free accord, willingly touch a hair upon the head\r\n    of any man? No, my lords; far would it be from me; but that\r\n    government which has left our people in misery--\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to trespass on\r\n    political grievances.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I am afraid I am occupying the time of the court\r\n    too much, but really a man placed in such a position as I now\r\n    occupy, finds it necessary to make a few observations. I know\r\n    it savours of a great deal that is bad and foul to be mixed\r\n    up with Fenian rebels, assassins, and cut-throats. It is\r\n    very bad; it is not a very good recommendation for a young\r\n    man. Even were that fact proved home to me--that I were a\r\n    Fenian--no act of mine has ever thrown dishonour on the name.\r\n    I know not what Fenian means. I am an Irishman, and that is\r\n    all-sufficient.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner then proceeded to criticise the evidence against him\r\nat considerable length. He declared emphatically that one of the\r\ndocuments sworn to be in his handwriting was not written by him. He\r\nthus continued:--\r\n\r\n    Your lordships are well aware that there are many\r\n    contradictions in the informers' testimony, and now here is\r\n    a matter which I am going to mention for the first time.\r\n    Corydon. in his first information at Kilmainham, swears that\r\n    he never knew me until he saw me at a Fenian pic-nic, and this\r\n    he modifies afterwards by the remark, that any man would be\r\n    allowed into these pic-nics on the payment of a certain sum.\r\n    I did not pay much attention to what the fellow was saying\r\n    about me, as I thought it did not affect me in the least; but\r\n    this I can distinctly remember, that Mr. Anderson, jun.--and\r\n    he is there to say if I am saying anything false--said that\r\n    the evidence of Corydon did not affect any one of the six\r\n    prisoners put in this dock but another and myself. It _is_\r\n    very strange if that was said by Mr. Anderson. He knew\r\n    that there was nothing more to be got out of Corydon,\r\n    the informer--that he had told everything he knew in his\r\n    information, but on pressure there was found to be a little\r\n    left in the sponge. They refreshed his memory a little, and\r\n    he comes to think that he saw Costello at a meeting in\r\n    814 Broadway I think he gives it. And here is a singular\r\n    occurrence--that Devany, who never swore an information\r\n    against me, comes on the table and swears that he also saw me\r\n    at 814 Broadway Here is one informer striving to corroborate\r\n    the other. It is a well-known fact that these informers speak\r\n    to each other, go over the evidence, and what is more likely\r\n    thin that they should make their evidence to agree--say, \"I\r\n    will corroborate your story, you corroborate mine.\" By this\r\n    means was it that the overt acts of the 5th of March, which\r\n    took place at Stepaside, Glencullen, and Tallaght, were\r\n    brought home to Costello--a man who was 4,000 miles away,\r\n    and living--and I say it on the word of a man, a Christian\r\n    man--peaceably, not belonging to that confederation. I did\r\n    not belong to the Fenian Brotherhood for twelve months before\r\n    I left America, if I did belong to it at any other time, so\r\n    help me God! God witnesses what I say, and he records my words\r\n    above. It is a painful position to be placed in. I know I am\r\n    a little excited. Were I to speak of this matter under other\r\n    circumstances, I would be more cool and collected. Were I\r\n    conscious of guilt--did I know that I merited this punishment,\r\n    I would not speak a word, but say that I deserved and well\r\n    merited the punishment about to be inflicted upon me. But,\r\n    my lords, there never was a man convicted in this court more\r\n    innocent of the charges made against him than Costello. The\r\n    overt acts committed in the county of Dublin, admitting\r\n    that the law of England is as it was laid down by your\r\n    lordship, that a man, a member of this confederacy, if\r\n    he lived in China, was responsible for the acts of his\r\n    confederates--admitting that to be law, I am still an innocent\r\n    man. Admitting and conceding that England has a right to try\r\n    me as a British subject, I still am an innocent man. Why do I\r\n    make these assertions? I know full well they cannot have any\r\n    effect in lessening the term of my sentence. Can I speak for\r\n    the sake of having an audience here to listen to me? Do I\r\n    speak for the satisfaction of hearing my own feeble voice? I\r\n    am not actuated by such motives. I speak because I wish to\r\n    let you know that I believe myself innocent; and he would be\r\n    a hard-hearted man, indeed, who would grudge me those few\r\n    sentences. Now, my lord, I have observed I did not belong to\r\n    the Fenian confederacy in March of this present year. I did\r\n    not belong to the Fenian confederacy anterior to the period\r\n    that Corydon and Devany allege that they saw me act as centre\r\n    and secretary to Fenian meetings; that, anterior to that\r\n    period, I never took act or part in the Fenian conspiracy up\r\n    to the period of my leaving America. Does it do me any good to\r\n    make these statements? I ask favours, as Halpin said, from\r\n    no man. I ask nothing but justice--stern justice--even-handed\r\n    justice. If I am guilty--if I have striven to overthrow the\r\n    government of this country, if I have striven to revolutionize\r\n    this country, I consider myself enough of a soldier to\r\n    bare my breast to the consequences, no matter whether that\r\n    consequence may reach me on the battle-field or in the cells\r\n    of Pentonville. I am not afraid of punishment. I have moral\r\n    courage to bear all that can be heaped upon me in Pentonville,\r\n    Portland, or Kilmainham, designated by one of us as the modern\r\n    Bastile. I cannot be worse treated, no matter where you send\r\n    me to. There never was a more infernal dungeon on God's earth\r\n    than Kilmainham. It is not much to the point, my lord. I will\r\n    not say another word about it. I believe I saw in some of the\r\n    weekly papers that it would be well to appoint a commission to\r\n    inquire--\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to proceed with that\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I will not say another word. I will conclude now.\r\n    There is much I could say, yet a man in my position cannot\r\n    help speaking. There are a thousand and one points affecting\r\n    me here, affecting my character as a man, affecting my life\r\n    and well-being, and he would be a hard-hearted man who could\r\n    blame me for speaking in strong terms. I feel that I have\r\n    within me the seeds of a disease that will soon put me into\r\n    an early grave, and I have within my breast the seeds of a\r\n    disease which will never allow me to see the expiration of my\r\n    imprisonment. It is, my lord, a disease, and I hope you will\r\n    allow me to speak on this subject, which has resulted from\r\n    the treatment I have been subjected to. I will pass over it as\r\n    rapidly as I can, because it is a nasty subject--Kilmainham.\r\n    But the treatment that I have received at Kilmainham--I will\r\n    not particularize any man, or the conduct of any man--has\r\n    been most severe, most harsh, not fit for a beast, much less\r\n    a human being. I was brought to Kilmainham, so far as I know,\r\n    without any warrant from the Lord Lieutenant. I was brought on\r\n    a charge the most visionary and airy. No man knew what I was.\r\n    No one could tell me or specify to me the charge on which I\r\n    was detained. I asked the magistrates at Dungarvan to advise\r\n    me of these charges. They would not tell me. At last I drove\r\n    them into such a corner as I might call it, that one of them\r\n    rose up and said, with much force, \"You are a Fenian.\" Now, my\r\n    lords, that is a very accommodating word. If a man only breaks\r\n    a window now he is a Fenian. If I could bring, or if I had\r\n    only the means of bringing, witnesses from America, I would\r\n    have established my innocence here without a probability of\r\n    doubt. I would have brought a host of witnesses to prove that\r\n    Costello was not the centre of a circle in 1866. I would\r\n    have brought a host of witnesses to prove that he was not\r\n    the secretary of a circle--never in all his life. My lords, I\r\n    speak calmly, and weigh well, and understand every word that\r\n    I say. If I speak wrong, time will bring the truth to the\r\n    surface, and I would sooner have fifteen years added to my\r\n    sentence than that any man might say I spoke from this dock,\r\n    which I regard as a holy place, where stood those whom I\r\n    revere as much as I do any of our saints--\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--I cannot suffer you to proceed thus.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I would not speak one word from this dock which I\r\n    knew to be other than truth. I admit there is a great deal of\r\n    suspicion, but beyond that there are no facts proved to bring\r\n    home the charge against me. What I have stated are facts,\r\n    every one of them. Now, my lords, is it any wonder that I\r\n    should speak at random and appear a little bit excited. I am\r\n    not excited in the least. I would be excited in a degree were\r\n    I expressing myself on any ordinary topic to any ordinary\r\n    audience. It is my manner, your lordships will admit, and\r\n    you have instructed the jury not to find me guilty, but to\r\n    discharge me from the dock, if they were not positive that\r\n    I was a Fenian on the 5th March. I believe these are the\r\n    instructions that his lordship, Justice Keogh, gave to the\r\n    jury--if I were not a Fenian on the 5th March, I was entitled\r\n    to an acquittal. Well I was not a Fenian at that time. I say\r\n    so as I have to answer to God. Now, to conclude. I have not\r\n    said much about being an American citizen. For why? I am not\r\n    permitted to speak on that subject. Now, as Colonel Warren\r\n    remarked, if I am not an American citizen, I am not to be held\r\n    responsible, but to the American Government. I did not press\r\n    myself on that government. They extended to me those rights\r\n    and those privileges; they said to me, \"Come forward, young\r\n    man; enrol yourself under our banner, under our flag; we\r\n    extend to you our rights and privileges--we admit you to the\r\n    franchise.\" I came not before I was asked. The invitation\r\n    was extended to me. I had no love then, and never will have,\r\n    towards England, and I accepted the invitation. I did forswear\r\n    allegiance to all foreign potentates, and more particularly\r\n    I forswore all allegiance to the Crown of Great Britain. Your\r\n    lordships say that the law of the land rules that I had no\r\n    right to do anything of the kind. That is a question for the\r\n    governments to settle. America is guilty of a great fraud if I\r\n    am in the wrong.\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to proceed in that\r\n    line of argument.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I will take up no more of your time. If I am still a\r\n    British subject, America is guilty.\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--I cannot allow you to refer either to\r\n    the American people or to the American government.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--Would you allow me to state they enticed me from my\r\n    allegiance to England; therefore she (America) is guilty of\r\n    high treason?\r\n\r\n    The LORD CHIEF BARON--We cannot allow you to speak on that\r\n    subject.\r\n\r\n    COSTELLO--I will conclude, then. I have nothing to say further\r\n    than to thank your lordships for the latitude you have given\r\n    me in these few remarks, and also to thank your lordships for\r\n    your kindness during my trial. I know you have done me every\r\n    justice; you did not strain the law against me; you did\r\n    everything that was consistent with your duty to do, and\r\n    I have nothing to complain of there. I must again thank my\r\n    learned and able counsel for the able, zealous, and eloquent\r\n    manner in which they defended me. I am at a loss for words\r\n    to express the gratitude I owe to each and every one of those\r\n    gentlemen who have so ably conducted my case. Now, my lords,\r\n    I will receive that sentence which is impending. I am prepared\r\n    for the worst. I am prepared to be torn from my friends, from\r\n    my relations, from my home. I am prepared to spend the bloom\r\n    of my youth in a tomb more dark and horrible than the tomb\r\n    wherein the dead rest. But there is one consolation that\r\n    I will bring into exile, if I may so call that house of\r\n    misery--a clear conscience, a heart whose still small voice\r\n    tells me that I have done no wrong to upbraid myself with.\r\n    This is the consolation that I have,--that my conscience\r\n    is clear. I know it appears somewhat egotistical for me to\r\n    speak thus, but it is a source of consolation for me that I\r\n    have nothing to upbraid myself with, and I will now say in\r\n    conclusion, that if my sufferings can ameliorate the wrongs or\r\n    the sufferings of Ireland. I am willing to be offered up as a\r\n    sacrifice for the good of old Erin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL W. HALPIN.\r\n\r\nAt the same Commission, before the same judges who had tried the cases\r\nof Colonel Warren and Augustine E. Costello, General William Halpin\r\nwas put on his trial for treason-felony. It was alleged that he was\r\none of the military officers of the Fenian organization, and, had been\r\nappointed to take command, in the Dublin district, in the rising which\r\nhad taken place on the 5th of March; and this it was sought to prove\r\nby the evidence of the informers, Massey, Corydon, Devany, and others.\r\n\r\nGeneral Halpin employed no counsel, and undertook the conduct of his\r\ncase himself. The considerations that had induced him to take this\r\ncourse he thus explained to the jury:--\r\n\r\n    Two reasons operated on my mind, and induced me to forego\r\n    the advantage I would derive from having some of the able and\r\n    learned counsel that plead at this bar. The first reason is,\r\n    that if you, gentlemen, are a jury selected by the Crown,\r\n    as juries are known to be selected heretofore in political\r\n    cases--if you are, in fact, a jury selected with the express\r\n    purpose of finding a verdict for the Crown--then, gentlemen,\r\n    all the talent and ability that I could employ would avail\r\n    me nothing. If, on the other hand, by any chance the\r\n    Attorney-General permitted honest men to find their way into\r\n    the box, then, gentlemen, lawyers were equally unnecessary for\r\n    me.\r\n\r\nNot an inaccurate view of the case, perhaps; the experience of the\r\nFenian trials, from first to last, certainly goes to support it.\r\n\r\nThe general set about his work of defending himself with infinite\r\ncoolness and self-possession. He was supplied with a chair, a small\r\ntable, and writing materials in the dock. When he had any notes to\r\nmake, he sat down, cleaned and adjusted his spectacles, and wrote out\r\nwhat he wanted. When he wished to cross-examine a witness, he removed\r\nhis glasses, came to the front of the dock, and put his questions\r\nsteadily and quietly, without a trace of excitement in his manner,\r\nbut always with a close application to the subject in hand. One could\r\nalmost refuse to believe, while listening to him, that he had not been\r\neducated and trained for the bar; and undoubtedly many of those who\r\nwear wigs and gowns in her Majesty's courts, are far from exhibiting\r\nthe same degree of aptitude for the profession. But it was in his\r\naddress to the jury that the remarkable talents of the man were most\r\nbrilliantly revealed. It was an extraordinary piece of argument and\r\neloquence, seasoned occasionally with much quiet humour, and enriched\r\nwith many passages that showed a high and courageous spirit. His\r\nscathing denunciations of the system of brutality practised towards\r\nthe political prisoners in Kilmainham gaol, and his picture of Mr.\r\nGovernor Price as \"the old gorilla,\" will long be remembered. One\r\nportion of his remarks ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n    The whole conduct of the Crown, since my arrest, has been such\r\n    as to warrant me in asserting that I have been treated\r\n    more like a beast of prey than a human being. If I had been\r\n    permitted to examine witnesses, I would have shown how the\r\n    case had been got up by the Crown. I would have shown them\r\n    how the Crown Solicitor, the gaolers, the head gaoler and the\r\n    deputy gaolers of Kilmainham, and the Protestant chaplain\r\n    of that institution, had gone in, day and night, to all\\\r\n    the witnesses--to the cells of the prisoners--with a bribe\r\n    in one hand and a halter in the other. I would have shown\r\n    how political cases were got up by the Crown in Ireland. I\r\n    would have shown how there existed, under the authority of\r\n    the Castle, a triumvirate of the basest wretches that ever\r\n    conspired to take away the lives and liberties of men. One of\r\n    these represented the law, another the gibbet in front of\r\n    the gaol, and another was supposed to represent the Church\r\n    militant.\r\n\r\nHere the Chief Baron interposed; but the prisoner soon after reverted\r\nto the subject, and said that every opportunity was taken in that gaol\r\nto wrong and torture the men incarcerated there on political charges.\r\nEvery petty breach of discipline was availed of to punish them,\r\nby sending them down to work the crank, and reducing their scanty\r\nrations. For the crime of not saluting Mr. Governor Price, they were\r\nplaced upon a dietary of seven ounces of what was called brown bread\r\nand a pint of Anna Liffey, in the twenty-four hours. Brown, indeed,\r\nthe article was, but whether it deserved the name of bread, was quite\r\nanother question. The turf-mould taken from the Bog of Allen was the\r\nnearest resemblance to it that he could think of. For his own part, he\r\ndid not mean to complain of his rations--he could take either rough\r\nor smooth as well as most men; but what he would complain of was, the\r\nsystem of petty insults and indignities offered by Mr. Price and his\r\nwarders to men of finer feelings than their own, and whom they knew to\r\nbe their superiors. He concluded his address in the following terms:--\r\n\r\n    I ask you if I have not thoroughly and sufficiently explained\r\n    away the terror, if I may use the term, of these papers, which\r\n    were taken from walls and other places, to be brought against\r\n    me here. I ask you, gentlemen, us reasonable men, if there\r\n    be a shadow of a case against me? I ask you if I have been\r\n    connected by an untainted witness with any act, in America or\r\n    Ireland, that would warrant you in deciding that I was guilty\r\n    of the charge with which I stand accused? Is there one single\r\n    overt act proved against me; or have I violated any law for\r\n    the violation of which I can be made amenable in this court?\r\n    I ask you if, in these letters which have been brought up\r\n    against me--one found in Thomas-street, another in the pocket\r\n    of a fellow-prisoner--there is anything that can affect me?\r\n    Recollect, gentlemen of the jury, that I speak to you now\r\n    as men imbued with a spirit of justice. I speak to you,\r\n    gentlemen, believing that you are honest, recognising your\r\n    intelligence, and confident that you will give in a verdict\r\n    in accordance with the dictates of your conscience. If you are\r\n    the jury that the Attorney-General hopes you are, gentlemen\r\n    of the jury, I am wasting time in speaking to you. If you are,\r\n    gentlemen, that jury which the Attorney-General hopes to make\r\n    the stepping-stone to the bench--for; gentlemen, I do not\r\n    accuse the Attorney-General of wishing to prosecute me for\r\n    the purpose of having me punished; I believe he is above any\r\n    paltry consideration of that sort--but, gentlemen, all men are\r\n    influenced by one motive or another, and the Attorney-General,\r\n    though he is the first law officer of the Crown in Ireland,\r\n    is human like ourselves; he is not above all human frailty,\r\n    but like other men, doubtless, likes office, and likes\r\n    the emolument which office brings. But, gentlemen of the\r\n    jury, it will be your fault if you make your shoulders the\r\n    stepping-stone for the Attorney-General to spring upon the\r\n    bench. I say these words to you in sober, solemn earnestness.\r\n    You are now trying a man who has lived all his life-time in\r\n    a country where freedom is venerated and adored. You may\r\n    believe, gentlemen, that you have the speech of freedom here;\r\n    but I claim, gentlemen, that the real spirit of freedom has\r\n    fled these shores many a century ago--has sped across the\r\n    Atlantic, and perched upon American soil; and, gentlemen, it\r\n    ought to be your wish and desire--as I am sure it is, for I am\r\n    unwilling to believe that you are the men the Attorney-General\r\n    deems you to be--to do me justice, and to prove that Dublin\r\n    juries do not on all occasions bring in a verdict at the\r\n    dictation of the Crown. Gentlemen, the principle of freedom\r\n    is at stake. Every man that is born into this world has a\r\n    right to freedom, unless he forfeits that right by his\r\n    own misdemeanour. Perhaps you have read the Declaration of\r\n    American Independence. In that declaration, drawn up by one\r\n    Thomas Jefferson, it is stated that every man born into this\r\n    world is born free and equal; that he has the right--the\r\n    inalienable right--to live in liberty and the pursuit of\r\n    happiness. These are the cardinal principles of liberty. I\r\n    claim these rights, unless I have forfeited them by my own\r\n    misconduct. I claim there is not one particle, one scintilla,\r\n    of evidence to warrant you in finding a verdict for the Crown.\r\n    I have not conspired with General Roberts or any of these\r\n    other generals. There is no evidence to show you anything\r\n    about any such conspiracy, as far as I am concerned. With\r\n    these facts before you, I ask you, as reasonable men, is\r\n    there one particle of evidence to show that I am guilty of\r\n    the charges preferred against me? I shall simply conclude\r\n    by repeating the words with which I commenced--that I leave\r\n    it between your conscience and your God to find a verdict\r\n    according to the evidence and, the truth. I leave it to you\r\n    in the name of that sacred justice which we all profess to\r\n    venerate, and I ask you not to allow your passion or your\r\n    prejudices to cloud your judgments--not to allow the country\r\n    to say that the Dublin juries are in the breeches-pocket of\r\n    the Attorney-General. Never let it be said that a prisoner,\r\n    forced into your country, carried off from the steamer which\r\n    was bearing him away from yours to his own, has been found\r\n    guilty on the evidence of perjured witnesses. Never let the\r\n    world say that a Dublin jury are not as honest as any other.\r\n    Do not allow those acrimonious feelings which unfortunately in\r\n    this country difference of sect engenders, to have anything to\r\n    with your verdict. As far as I am concerned, I ask no favour\r\n    from you. I ask no favour from any man that lives in the\r\n    world. I have always, gentlemen, adhered to my own principles,\r\n    and will do so while I am able. If you consent to send me\r\n    for my life to a penitentiary you will not make the slightest\r\n    impression on me. I am pleading for life and liberty--I am\r\n    pleading in the cause of justice, and I leave it in your\r\n    hands. I demand that you should exercise your best judgement\r\n    to render a verdict before the Omnipotent Creator of the\r\n    universe, who is looking into your hearts as well as mine--to\r\n    render a verdict for which you will be sorry--to render a\r\n    verdict that your countrymen will cheer--to render a verdict\r\n    that will make you venerated and admired im the land of your\r\n    birth while you live on this earth.\r\n\r\nThe jury, however, found not for the prisoner, but for the Crown.\r\n\r\nWhen General Halpin took his place in the dock with, his fellow\r\n\"convicts,\" Colonel Warren and Augustine E. Costello, to receive his\r\nsentence, he appeared calm and uuimpassioned as ever. The question why\r\nsentence should not be passed on him having been put--\r\n\r\n    The Prisoner said that before he spoke to the question put\r\n    him by the Clerk of the Crown, he wished to say a few words on\r\n    another topic. The day before yesterday he was handed by the\r\n    governor of Kilmainham a letter which had come from America,\r\n    and enclosed a draft. The draft the governor refused to give\r\n    up, and also refused to state what disposition he intended\r\n    to make of it. The deputy governor had other moneys of his,\r\n    and he requested that those, as well as the draft, should be\r\n    restored to him.\r\n\r\n    The Attorney-General, in an undertone, having addressed some\r\n    observations to the bench.\r\n\r\n    The Lord Chief Baron said that the prisoner, having been\r\n    convicted of felony, his property was at the disposal of the\r\n    authorities, and that any representation he had to make on the\r\n    subject should be made to the government.\r\n\r\n    Halpin said he wished that the money might be transferred to\r\n    the governor of whatever gaol he was to be imprisoned in,\r\n    so that he might have the use of it to purchase necessaries\r\n    should he require them.\r\n\r\n    LORD CHIEF BARON--If you desire to make any representation it\r\n    must be through the government.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--I don't wish to make any representation to the\r\n    government on the subject. I will permit the government to add\r\n    robbery to perjury.\r\n\r\nThe Prisoner, in reply to a question asked by the Clerk of the Crown,\r\nsaid that justice had not been dealt out to him as he thought it might\r\nhave been. He had been prevented by the Crown from getting witnesses\r\nfor his defence, and from seeing his witnesses, while the Crown had\r\ntaken four months to get their witnesses properly trained, and to\r\nransack all the Orange lodges of Dublin for jurors. He complained of\r\nthe rules of the gaol, and of the law that permitted them to be in\r\nforce, and said:--\r\n\r\n    I deny the jurisdiction of this court in common with Colonel\r\n    Warren. I owe no allegiance to this country, and were I a\r\n    free man to-morrow I would sooner swear allegiance to the\r\n    King of Abyssinia than give half-an-hour's allegiance to the\r\n    government of this country--a government that has blasted\r\n    the hopes of half the world and disgusted it all. I am not, I\r\n    suppose, permitted to speak of the verdict given against me by\r\n    the jury. It was entirely unnecessary for the Crown to produce\r\n    one single witness against me. The jury had their lesson\r\n    before they came to the box.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--It is impossible for me to allow you to\r\n    proceed with this line of observation.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--I wish to simply say that the jury exhibited an\r\n    extreme anxiety to find a verdict against me before I had\r\n    even said a word to them. I saw their anxiety. I knew from\r\n    the moment they were put into the box that a verdict of guilty\r\n    would be returned against me. I knew it from looking at the\r\n    conduct of the jury in the box.--I knew it from the way the\r\n    jury were empanelled, and I knew the Attorney-General relied\r\n    upon the jury for a verdict when he set three citizens aside.\r\n    I therefore conclude, and rightly, that all the eloquent\r\n    talent that ever pleaded at this bar would be entirely useless\r\n    to me whilst such a jury was in the box. The Crown, in order\r\n    to give some colour to the proceedings, thought proper to\r\n    produce several witnesses against me. Eleven witnesses\r\n    were examined, and out of these no less than nine committed\r\n    absolute, diabolical, and egregious perjury.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--You are transcending the limit within which\r\n    the law confines you.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--I do not blame you for enforcing the law us it stands.\r\n    By no means. I have to thank your lordship for your kindness\r\n    during the progress of my trial. I do not blame you, because\r\n    the law stands as it does, but what I say is--that the law is\r\n    absurd in taking me and trying me as a British subject whilst\r\n    I am a citizen of the United States, without a particle of\r\n    evidence to show that I was born under the jurisdiction of\r\n    the British Crown. I must say that I look to another place,\r\n    another government, and another people to see that justice\r\n    shall be done me.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--Here again you are transcending the limits\r\n    which the law allows. We could not deal with any consideration\r\n    connected with what any government will do.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--I am aware that it is not within your province to deal\r\n    with the acts of another government, but I may be permitted to\r\n    say this--that the outrages offered me and those gentlemen who\r\n    claim, like me, to be citizens of the United States will be\r\n    gladly submitted to if they only have the effect of making the\r\n    sword of Brother Jonathan spring from its scabbard.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I cannot suffer you to proceed with this line\r\n    of observation. I cannot suffer to make this a place of appeal\r\n    to persons in this country or in America.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--I am not making any appeal to any man. Although I was\r\n    found guilty by a jury of this court I deem my conduct above\r\n    reproach. I know how I have been convicted, and will still\r\n    assert that the first gun fired in anger between this country\r\n    and America will be a knell of comfort to my ears.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I will be compelled to remove you from where\r\n    you are now if you proceed with this line of observation.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--Well, then, if I am not permitted to say that,--\r\n\r\n    CHIEF BARON--You are not permitted to make any observation\r\n    upon what any government of any country may do.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--I think the reference has not anything to do with any\r\n    government or any country. It refers to a fact that will\r\n    come to pass, and when I shall hear the death-knell of this\r\n    infamous government.\r\n\r\n    The CHIEF BARON--I will not allow you to proceed.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--Well, I cannot be prevented thinking it. Now, I will\r\n    refer to a subject which I may be allowed to speak upon. You\r\n    will recollect that I had addressed a letter to Mr. Price,\r\n    asking him to furnish me, at my own expense, with two of the\r\n    morning papers--the _Irish Times_ and _Freeman's Journal_. I\r\n    believe they are both loyal papers; at least they claim to be\r\n    loyal, and I have no doubt they are of the admitted character\r\n    of loyalty registered in the principles of Dublin Castle. The\r\n    reason why I wanted these papers was, that I believed that\r\n    the best reports of the trials since the opening of the\r\n    Commission, would be found in them. I said to Mr. Price that\r\n    it was important that I should see all the evidence given by\r\n    the informers who were to be produced against me, to enable me\r\n    to make up my defence. I was denied, even at my own expense,\r\n    to be furnished with these papers, and that I complain of as\r\n    a wanton outrage. Perhaps Mr. Price was governed by some rule\r\n    of Kilmainham, for it appears that the rules of Kilmainham\r\n    are often as far outside the law of the country as I have been\r\n    said to be by the Attorney-General. In fact, Mr. Price stated\r\n    when giving his testimony, that he was not governed by any law\r\n    or rule, but that he was governed solely and entirely by his\r\n    own imperial will.\r\n\r\n    CHIEF BARON--That I cannot allow to be said without at once\r\n    setting it right. Mr. Price said no such thing. He said that\r\n    with respect to one particular matter--namely, the reading of\r\n    prisoners' correspondence, he was bound to exercise his own\r\n    discretion as to what he would send out of the gaol, and what\r\n    he would hold. This is the only matter in which Mr. Price said\r\n    he would exercise his own discretion.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER.--I think, my lord, you will allow your memory to go\r\n    back to the cross-examination of Mr. Price, and you will find\r\n    that when I asked him by what authority he gave the letters he\r\n    suppressed into the hands of the Crown to be produced here,\r\n    he stated he had no other authority than his own will for so\r\n    doing.\r\n\r\n    CHIEF BARON--You are quite right with respect to the\r\n    correspondence.\r\n\r\n    PRISONER--I say he violated the law of the land in so doing,\r\n    and I claim that he had no right to use those letters written\r\n    by me in my private capacity to friends in America, asking\r\n    for advice and assistance, and the very first letter\r\n    that he read was a letter written to a man named Byrne.\r\n    That, you may recollect, was put into the hands of the\r\n    Attorney-General--kept by him for four months. That was the\r\n    first intimation I had of its suppression or of its production\r\n    here by the Crown. Now, the letter was addressed to a friend\r\n    in New York, asking him to look after my trunk, which had been\r\n    taken away without my consent by the captain of the vessel in\r\n    which I was arrested. Mr. Price never told me he suppressed\r\n    that letter, and I was three months waiting for a reply,\r\n    which, of course, I did not receive, as the letter never went.\r\n    Mr. Price suppressed another letter yesterday. It was written\r\n    to a friend of mine in Washington, in relation to my trial and\r\n    conviction, and asking him to present my case to the President\r\n    of the United States, detailing the case as it proceeded in\r\n    this court. Mr. Price thought proper to suppress that letter,\r\n    and I ask that he be compelled to produce it, so that, if your\r\n    lordships think fit, it may be read in court.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I cannot do that. I cannot have a letter of\r\n    that character read in open court.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--Am I entitled to get the letter to have it destroyed,\r\n    or is Price to have it, to do with it as he pleases?\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--I can make no order in the matter.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN--Then Price is something like Robinson Crusoe--\"Monarch\r\n    of all he surveys;\" monarch of Kilmainham; and when I ask if\r\n    he is to be controlled, I find there is no law to govern him.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BABON--you have now no property in these letters,\r\n    being a convict.\r\n\r\n    THE PRISONER--I will very soon be told I have no property in\r\n    myself. I claim to have been arrested on the high seas, and\r\n    there was then no case against me, and the Crown had to wait\r\n    four months to pick up papers and get men from Stepaside, and\r\n    arrange plans between Mr. Price and his warders to fill up any\r\n    gap that might be wanted. I was arrested out of the _habeas\r\n    corpus_ jurisdiction, without authority, and detained four\r\n    months in gaol until the Crown could trump up a case against\r\n    me. Have I not a right to complain that I should be consigned\r\n    to a dungeon for life in consequence of a trumped-up case? I\r\n    am satisfied that your lordships have stated the case as it\r\n    stands, but I am not satisfied that I have been convicted\r\n    under any law. I have been four months in durance vile, and\r\n    vile durance it has been. The preachers tell us that hell is a\r\n    very bad place, and the devil a very bad boy, but he could not\r\n    hold a candle to old Price.\r\n\r\n    THE CHIEF BARON--You are trespassing very much upon a very\r\n    large indulgence. I must adopt a more decisive course if you\r\n    persevere.\r\n\r\n    HALPIN (laughing)--Well, my lord, I will say no more about the\r\n    old gorilla. The Crown officers have laid much stress upon\r\n    the fact that I have travelled under different names, and\r\n    therefore I was guilty of a great crime. I have precedent for\r\n    it when I read in the papers that some continental monarchs\r\n    travel under an assumed name, and I hear that the Prince of\r\n    Wales does so also when he thinks proper to go the London\r\n    brothels.\r\n\r\nAt this point the Court cut short his address, and Chief Baron Pigot\r\nproceeded to pass sentence on the three prisoners.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE SENTENCES.\r\n\r\nAfter some share of preliminary remarks, the Chief Baron announced the\r\nsentence of the court. It was for\r\n\r\n    John Warren, 15 years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\n    William Halpin, 15 years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\n    Augustine E. Costello, 12 years' penal servitude.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners heard the announcement without manifesting any emotion.\r\nGeneral Halpin remarked that he would take fifteen years more any day\r\nfor Ireland. Colonel Warren informed the Court that he did not think\r\na lease of the British Empire worth thirty-seven-and-a-half cents; and\r\nthen all three, followed by a _posse_ of warders, disappeared from the\r\ndock.\r\n\r\nAnd thus were three men of education and ability added to the hundreds\r\nwho are now rotting their lives away in British dungeons, because of\r\nthe love they bore to their country, and their hatred of the misrule\r\nwhich makes her the most afflicted and miserable land on earth. It is\r\nhard for Ireland to see such men stricken down and torn from her upon\r\nsuch an accusation; yet, looking at the noble bearing of that long\r\nlist of devoted men when confronted with the worst terrors to which\r\ntheir enemies could subject them, she has something which may well\r\ncause the light of pride to glisten in her eyes, even while the tears\r\nof love and pity are falling from them. And we would say to her in\r\nthe noble words of a French writer, one of the many generous-hearted\r\nforeigners, whose affectionate admiration has been won by her\r\nsufferings and her constancy, the Rev. Adolphe Perraud, Priest of the\r\nOratory, Paris:--\r\n\r\n\"Take heart! your trials will not last for ever; the works of iniquity\r\nare passing and perishable: 'Vidi impium super exaltamum et elevatum\r\nsicut cedros Libani, et ecce non erat!' (Ps. xvxvi.) Patience, then,\r\neven still! Do not imagine that you are forsaken: God forsakes not\r\nthose that believe in Him. The day of retribution will come--to teach\r\nmen that no struggle against right is rightful, that probation is not\r\nabandonment; that God and conscience have unimagined resources against\r\nbrutal spoliation and the triumphs of injustice; and that if men are\r\noften immoral in their designs and actions, there is still in the\r\ngeneral course of history a sovereign morality, and judgments the\r\nforerunners of the infallible judgment of God.\"",
