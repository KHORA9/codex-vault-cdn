I.--NOVEMBER, 1857.--NO. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOUGLAS JERROLD.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy personal acquaintance with Douglas Jerrold began in the spring of 1851.\r\nI had always had a keen relish for his wit and fancy; I felt a peculiar\r\ninterest in a man who, like myself, had started in life in the Navy; and\r\none of the things poor Douglas prided himself on was his readiness to know\r\nand recognize young fellows fighting in his own profession. I shall not\r\nsoon forget the dinner he gave at the Whittington Club that spring. St.\r\nClement's had rung out a late chime before we parted; and it was a drizzly,\r\nmisty small hour as he got into a cab for Putney, where he was then living.\r\nI had found him all I expected; and he did not disappoint, on further\r\nacquaintance, the promise of that first interview. It will be something to\r\nremember in afterlife, that one enjoyed the friendship of so brilliant a\r\nman; and if I can convey to my readers a truer, livelier picture of his\r\ngenius and person than they have been able to form for themselves hitherto,\r\nI shall be delighted to think that I have done my duty to his memory. The\r\nlast summer which he lived to see is now waning; let us gather, ere it\r\ngoes, the \"lilies\" and \"purple flowers\" that are due to his grave.\r\n\r\nJerrold's Biography is still unwritten. The work is in the hands of his\r\neldest son,--his successor in the editorship of \"Lloyd's,\"--and will be\r\ndone with pious carefulness. Meanwhile I cannot do more than _sketch_ the\r\nnarrative of his life; but so much, at all events, is necessary as shall\r\nenable the reader to understand the Genius and Character which I aspire to\r\nset before him.\r\n\r\nDouglas William Jerrold was, I take it, of South-Saxon ancestry,--dashed\r\nwith Scotch through his grandmother, whose maiden name was Douglas, and who\r\nis said to have been a woman of more than ordinary energy of character. As\r\na Scot, I should like to trace him to that spreading family apostrophized\r\nby the old poet in such beautiful words,--\r\n\r\n  \"O Douglas, O Douglas,\r\n  Tender and true!\"\r\n\r\nBut I don't think he ever troubled himself on the subject; though he had\r\nnone of that contempt for a good pedigree which is sometimes found in men\r\nof his school of politics. As regarded fortune, he owed every thing to\r\nnature and to himself; no man of our age had so thoroughly fought his own\r\nway; and no man of any age has had a much harder fight of it. To understand\r\nand appreciate him, it was, and is, necessary to bear this fact in mind.\r\nIt colored him as the Syrian sun did the old crusading warrior. And hence,\r\ntoo, he was in a singular degree a representative man of his age; his\r\nage having set him to wrestle with it,--having tried his force in every\r\nway,--having left its mark on his entire surface. Jerrold and the century\r\nhelp to explain each other, and had found each other remarkably in earnest\r\nin all their dealings. This fact stamps on the man a kind of genuineness,\r\nvisible in all his writings,--and giving them a peculiar force and\r\nraciness, such as those of persons with a less remarkable experience never\r\npossess. We are told, that, in selling yourself to the Devil, it is the\r\nproper traditionary practice to write the contract in your blood. Douglas,\r\nin binding himself against him, did the same thing. You see his blood in\r\nhis ink,--and it gives a depth of tinge to it.\r\n\r\nHe was the son of a country manager named Samuel Jerrold, and was born in\r\nLondon on the 3d of January, 1803. His father was for a long time manager\r\nof the seaport theatres of Sheerness and Southend,--which stand opposite\r\neach other, just where the Thames becomes the sea. Douglas spent most of\r\nhis boyhood, therefore, about the sea-coast, in the midst of a life that\r\nwas doubly dramatic,--dramatic as real, and dramatic as theatrical. There\r\nwere sea, ships, sailors, prisoners, the hum of war, the uproar of seaport\r\nlife, on the one hand; on the other, the queer, rough, fairy world (to\r\nhim at once fairy world and home world) of the theatre. It was a position\r\nto awaken precociously, one would think, the feelings of the quick-eyed,\r\nquick-hearted lad. No wonder he took the sea-fever to which all our blood\r\nis liable, and tried a bout of naval life. At eleven years of age he\r\nbecame a middy, and served a short time--not two years in all--in a vessel\r\nstationed in the North Sea. Naval life was a rough affair in those days.\r\nJerrold's most remarkable experience seems to have been bringing over\r\nthe wounded of Waterloo from Belgium; which stamped on his mind a sense\r\nof the horrors of war that never left him, but is marked on his writings\r\neverywhere, in spite of a certain combative turn and an admiration of\r\nheroes which also belonged to him. To the last, he had an interest in sea\r\nmatters, and spoke with enthusiasm of Lord Nelson. But the literary use he\r\nmade of his nautical experience ended with \"Black-eyed Susan.\" He was a boy\r\nwhen he came ashore and threw himself on the very different sea of London;\r\nand it is the influence of London that is most perceptible in his mature\r\nworks. Here his work was done, his battles fought, his mind formed; and you\r\nmay observe in his writings a certain romantic and ideal way of speaking of\r\nthe country, which shows that to him it was a place of retreat and luxury,\r\nrather than of sober, practical living. This is not uncommon with literary\r\nmen whose lot has been cast in a great city, if they possess, as Jerrold\r\ndid, that poetic temperament which is alive to natural beauty.\r\n\r\nHe now became an apprentice in a printing-office, and went through the\r\nordinary course of a printer's life. He felt genius stirring in him, and\r\nhe strove for the knowledge to give it nourishment, and the field to give\r\nit exercise. He read and wrote, as well as worked and talked. It would be\r\na task for antiquarian research to recover his very earliest lucubrations\r\nscattered among the ephemeral periodicals of that day. Plays of his might\r\nbe dug out, whose very names are unknown to his most intimate friends. He\r\nscattered his early fruit far and wide,--getting little from the world in\r\nexchange. Literature was then a harder struggle than in our days. Jerrold\r\ndid not know the successful men who presided over it. He had no patrons;\r\nand he had few friends. The isolation and poverty in which he formed his\r\nmind and style deepened the _peculiarity_ which was a characteristic of\r\nthese. They gave to his genius that intense and eccentric character which\r\nit has; and no doubt (for Fortune has a way of compensating) the chill they\r\nbreathed on the fruits of his young nature enriched their ripeness, as a\r\ntouch of frost does with plums. The grapes from which Tokay is made are\r\nleft hanging even when the snow is on them;--all the better for Tokay!\r\n\r\nHis youth, then, was a long and hard struggle to get bread in\r\nexchange for wit;--a struggle like that of the poor girls who sell\r\nviolets in the streets. He was wont to talk of those early days very\r\nfreely,--passionately, even to tears, when he got excited,--and always\r\nbravely, heartily, and with the right \"moral\" to follow. When Diderot had\r\npassed a whole day without bread, he vowed that if he ever got prosperous,\r\nhe would save any fellow-creature that he could from such suffering.\r\nJerrold had learned the same lesson. Through life, he took the side of\r\nthe poor and weak. It was the secret, at once, of his philosophy and his\r\npolitics. He got endless abuse for his eternal tirades against the great\r\nand the \"respectable,\"--against big-wigs of every size and shape. But\r\nthe critics who attacked him for this negative pole of his intellectual\r\ncharacter overlooked the positive one. He had kindness and sympathy enough;\r\nbut he always gave them first to those who wanted them most. And as\r\nhumorist and satirist he had a natural tendency to attack power,--to\r\nplay Pasquin against the world's Pope. In fact, his radicalism was that\r\nof a humorist. He never adopted the utilitarian, or, as it was called,\r\n\"philosophical,\" radicalism which was so fashionable in his younger\r\ndays;--not, indeed, the Continental radicalism held by a party in\r\nEngland;--but was an independent kind of warrior, fighting under his own\r\nbanner, and always rather with the weapons of a man of letters than those\r\nof a politician. For the business aspect of politics he never showed any\r\npredilection from first to last.\r\n\r\nWell, then,--picture him to yourself, reader, a small, delicate youth, with\r\nfair, prominent features,--long, thin hair,--keen, eager, large, blue eyes,\r\nglancing out from right to left, as he walks the streets of Babylon,--and\r\nseizing with a quick impulsiveness every feeling of the hour. Still\r\nyoung,--and very young,--he has married for love. He is living in a cottage\r\nor villakin on the outskirts of town, where there is just a peep of green\r\nto keep one's feelings fresh; and he is writing for the stage. It is hard\r\nwork, and sometimes the dun is at the door, and contact is inevitable with\r\nmen who don't understand the precious jewel he weareth in his head;--but\r\nthe week's hard work is got through somehow; and on Sundays he sallies\r\nforth for rural air with a little knot of friends, and the talk is of art,\r\nand letters, and the world. So quick and keen a nature as his had immense\r\nbuoyancy in it. Nay, for the very dun young Douglas had an epigram,--as\r\nbright, but not as welcome, as a sovereign. A saying of those early days\r\nhas found its way into a comedy,--but not the less belongs to his authentic\r\nbiography. A threatening attorney shakes his fist at the villakin where at\r\nthe window the wit is parleying with him. \"I'll put a man in the house,\r\nSir!\" \"Couldn't you,\" says Douglas, (and of course the right-minded reader\r\nis shocked,) \"couldn't you make it a woman?\" What a scandalous way to treat\r\na man of business! Between Douglas and the lawyers, for many years, there\r\nwas open war. He was a kind of Robin Hood to these representatives of the\r\nCrown,--adopting the plucky and defiant gaiety of the old outlaw, and\r\nshooting keen arrows at them with a bow that never grew weak.\r\n\r\nThe theatres were his regular sources of employment for many years, and he\r\nwrote dramas at a salary. Tradition and family connection must have led\r\nhim chiefly to this walk; for though he had some of the most important\r\nqualities of a dramatist, very few of his dramas seem likely to live,--and\r\neven these are not equal to his works in other departments. The \"Man made\r\nof Money\" will outlast his best play. His most popular drama,--\"Black-eyed\r\nSusan,\"--though clever, pretty, and tender, is not, as a work of art,\r\nworthy of his genius; nor did he consider it so himself. In his dramas\r\nwe find, I think, rather touches of character, than characters,--scenes,\r\nrather than plots,--_disjecta membra_ of dramatic genius, rather than\r\nharmonious creations of it. He could not separate himself from his work\r\nsufficiently for the purposes of the higher stage. As Johnson says of\r\n\"Cato,\" \"We pronounce the name of Cato, but we think on Addison,\"--so one\r\nmay say of any character of Jerrold's, that it suggests and refers us to\r\nits author. All the gold has his head on it. To be sure, there is plenty of\r\ngold; and I wish somebody would put his scores of plays, big and little,\r\ninto a kind of wine-press and give us the wine. There is always the wit of\r\nthe man, whether the play be \"Gertrude's Cherries,\" or \"The Smoked Mixer,\"\r\nor \"Fifteen Years of a Drunkard's Life,\"--or what not. _That_ quality never\r\nfailed him. He dresses up all his characters in that brilliant livery. But\r\ndialogue is not enough for the stage, and compared with the attraction of\r\nan intense action is nothing. Besides, Jerrold found the modern taste for\r\nspectacle forming thirty years ago. In his prefaces he complains bitterly\r\nof the preference of the public for the mechanical over the higher\r\nattractions of the art. And the satirical war he waged against actors\r\nand managers showed that he looked back with little pleasure to the days\r\nwhen his life was chiefly occupied with them and their affairs. It may be\r\nmentioned here, that he was very shabbily treated by several people who\r\nowed fame and fortune to his genius. I have heard a curious story about his\r\nconnection with Davidge, manager of the Surrey,--the original, as I take\r\nit, of his Bajazet Gay. They say that he had used Douglas very ill,--that\r\nDouglas invoked this curse upon him,--\"that he might live to keep his\r\ncarriage, and yet not be able to ride in it,\"--and that it was fulfilled,\r\ncuriously, to the letter. The ancient gods, we know, took the comic poet\r\nunder their protection and avenged him. Was this a case of the kind,--or\r\nbut a flying false anecdote? I would not be certain;--but at least,\r\nwhen Davidge died one evening, and Douglas was informed of the hour, he\r\nremarked, \"I did not think he would have died before the half-price came\r\nin!\" Sordid fellows are not safe from genius even in the grave. It spoils\r\ntheir sepulchral monuments,--as the old heralds tore the armorial blazonry\r\nfrom plebeian tombs.\r\n\r\nHis first fame and success, however, were owing to the Drama; and though\r\nhis non-dramatic labors were greater and still more successful, he never\r\naltogether left the stage. I repeat, that I value his plays, most, because\r\nthey helped to discipline him for his after-work; and I thank the theatre\r\nchiefly for ripening in its heat the philosophic humorist. That was the\r\nreal character of the man. He tried many things, and he produced much;\r\nbut the root of him was that he was a humorous thinker. He did not write\r\nfirst-rate plays, or first-rate novels, rich as he was in _the elements_\r\nof playwright and novelist. He was not an artist. But he had a rare and\r\noriginal eye and soul,--and in a peculiar way he could pour out himself.\r\nIn short, to be an Essayist was the bent of his nature and genius. English\r\nliterature is rich in such men,--in men whose works are cherished for\r\nthe individuality they reveal. What the Song is in poetry the Essay is\r\nin prose. The producer pours out himself in his own way, and cannot be\r\nseparated even in thought from that which he has produced. Jerrold's\r\ncharacters in plays and novels are interesting to me because they are\r\nJerrold in masquerade.\r\n\r\nBut none of us are just what we should like to be. Fortune has her say in\r\nthe matter; and as Bacon observes, a man's fortune works on his nature, and\r\nhis nature on his fortune. Many a play Jerrold no doubt wrote when he would\r\nrather have been writing something else,--and so on, as life rolled by, and\r\nthe day that was passing over him required to be provided for. His fight\r\nfor fame was long and hard; and his life was interrupted, like that of\r\nother men, by sickness and pain. In the stoop in his gait, in the lines in\r\nhis face, you saw the man who had reached his Ithaca by no mere yachting\r\nover summer seas. And hence, no doubt, the utter absence in him of all\r\nthat conventionalism which marks the man of quiet experience and habitual\r\nconformity to the world. In the streets, a stranger would have known\r\nJerrold to be a remarkable man; you would have gone away speculating\r\non him. In talk, he was still Jerrold;--not Douglas Jerrold, Esq., a\r\nsuccessful gentleman, whose heart and soul you were expected to know\r\nnothing about, and with whom you were to eat your dinner peaceably,\r\nlike any common man. No. He was at all times Douglas the peculiar and\r\nunique,--with his history in his face, and his genius on his tongue,--nay,\r\nand after a little, with his heart on his sleeve. This made him piquant;\r\nand the same character makes his writings piquant. Hence, too, he is\r\noften _quaint_,--a word which describes what no other word does,--always\r\nconveying a sense of originality, and of what, when we wish to be\r\ncondemnatory, we call egotism, but which, when it belongs to genius, is\r\ndelightful.\r\n\r\nAs he became better known, he wrote in higher quarters. \"Men of Character\"\r\nappeared in \"Blackwood,\"--a curious collection of philosophical\r\nstories;--for artist he was not; he was always a thinker. He had a way of\r\ndressing up a bit of philosophical observation into a story very happily.\r\nHe had much feeling for symbol, and, like the old architects, would fill\r\nall things, pretty or ugly, with meaning. When one reads these stories, one\r\ndoes not feel as if it were the writer's vocation to be a story-teller, but\r\nas if he were using the story as a philosophical toy. And it was fortunate\r\nfor him that he fell on an age of periodicals, a class of works which just\r\nsuited his genius. He and the modern development of periodical literature\r\ngrew up together, and grew prosperous together. He was never completely\r\nknown in England till after the establishment of \"Punch.\" An independent\r\nand original organ just suited him, above all; for there he had the full\r\nplay which he required as a humorist, and as a self-formed man with a\r\npeculiar style and experience. \"Punch\" was the \"Argo\" which conveyed him to\r\nthe Golden Fleece.\r\n\r\nUp to the time of the appearance of this journal, Jerrold had scattered\r\nhimself very freely over periodical literature. He had conquered a\r\nposition. He had formed his mind. He had seen the world in many phases, and\r\nbesides his knowledge of London, had varied his experience of that city\r\nby a lengthened residence in France. Still, he had not yet caught _the\r\nnation_,--there being many degrees of celebrity below _that_ stage of it;\r\nand now, in middle life, his best and crowning success was to begin.\r\n\r\nI believe that Jerrold had long desiderated a \"Punch\"; but it is certain\r\nthat the present famous periodical of that name was started by his\r\nson-in-law, Mr. Henry Mayhew. For a while it had no great success, and the\r\ncopyright was sold for a small sum to Messrs. Bradbury and Evans. Success\r\ncame, and such a success that \"Punch\" must always last as part of the comic\r\nliterature of England. That literature is rich in political as well as\r\nother forms of satire; and from various causes, about the time of \"Punch,\"\r\npolitical satire was at a low ebb. The newspapers no longer published\r\nsquibs as they once had done. The days of the Hooks and Moores had gone\r\nby; there was nobody to do with the pen what H. B. did with the pencil. So\r\n\"Punch\" was at once a novelty and a necessity,--from its width of scope,\r\nits joint pictorial and literary character, and its exclusive devotion to\r\nthe comic features of the age. \"Figaro\" (a satirical predecessor, by Mr. à\r\nBeckett) had been very clever, but wanted many of \"Punch's\" features, and\r\nwas, above all, not so calculated to hit \"society\" and get into families.\r\n\r\nJerrold's first papers of mark in \"Punch\" were those signed \"Q.\" His style\r\nwas now formed, as his mind was, and these papers bear the stamp of his\r\npeculiar way of thinking and writing. Assuredly, his is a _peculiar_ style\r\nin the strict sense; and as marked as that of Carlyle or Dickens. You see\r\nthe self-made man in it,--a something _sui generis_,--not formed on the\r\n\"classical models,\" but which has grown up with a kind of twist in it, like\r\na tree that has had to force its way up surrounded by awkward environments.\r\nFundamentally, the man is a thinking humorist; but his mode of expression\r\nis strange. The perpetual inversions, the habitual irony, the mingled\r\ntenderness and mockery, give a kind of gnarled surface to the style, which\r\nis pleasant when you get familiar with it, but which repels the stranger,\r\nand to some people even remains permanently disagreeable. I think it was\r\nhis continual irony which at last brought him to writing as if under a\r\nmask; whereas it would have been better to write out flowingly, musically,\r\nand lucidly. His mixture of satire and kindliness always reminds me of\r\nthose lanes near Beyrout in which you ride with the prickly-pear bristling\r\nalongside of you, and yet can pluck the grapes which force themselves\r\namong it from the fields. Inveterately satirical as Jerrold is, he is even\r\n\"spoonily\" tender at the same time; and it lay deep in his character; for\r\nthis wit and _bon-vivant_, the merriest and wittiest man of the company,\r\nwould cry like a child, as the night drew on, and the talk grew serious. No\r\ntheory could be more false than that he was a cold-blooded satirist,--sharp\r\nas steel is sharp, from being hard. The basis of his nature was\r\nsensitiveness and impulsiveness. His wit is not of the head only, but\r\nof the heart,--often sentimental, and constantly _fanciful_, that is,\r\ndependent on a quality which imperatively requires a sympathetic nature\r\nto give it full play. Take those \"Punch\" papers which soon helped to make\r\n\"Punch\" famous, and Jerrold himself better known. Take the \"Story of a\r\nFeather,\" as a good expression of his more earnest and tender mood. How\r\ndelicately all the part about the poor actress is worked up! How moral, how\r\nstoical, the feeling that pervades it! The bitterness is healthy,--healthy\r\nas bark. We cannot always be\r\n\r\n  \"Seeing only what is fair,\r\n  Sipping only what is sweet,\"\r\n\r\nin the presence of such phenomena as are to be seen in London alongside\r\nof our civilization. If any feeling of Jerrold's was intense, it was his\r\nfeeling of sympathy with the poor. I shall not soon forget the energy and\r\ntenderness with which he would quote these lines of his favorite Hood:--\r\n\r\n  \"Poor Peggy sells flowers from street to street,\r\n  And--think of that, ye who find life sweet!--\r\n    She hates the smell of roses.\"\r\n\r\nHe was, therefore, to be pardoned when he looked with extreme suspicion\r\nand severity on the failings of the rich. _They_ at least, he knew, were\r\nfree from those terrible temptations which beset the unfortunate. They\r\ncould protect themselves. They needed to be reminded of their duties.\r\nSuch was his view, though I don't think he ever carried it so far as he\r\nwas accused of doing. Nay, I think he sometimes had to prick up his zeal\r\nbefore assuming the _flagellum_. For a successful, brilliant man like\r\nhimself,--full of humor and wit,--eminently convivial, and sensitive to\r\npleasure,--the temptation rather was to adopt the easy philosophy that\r\nevery thing was all right,--that the rich were wise to enjoy themselves\r\nwith as little trouble as possible,--and that the poor (good fellows, no\r\ndoubt) must help themselves on according as they got a chance. It was\r\nto Douglas's credit that he always felt the want of a deeper and holier\r\ntheory, and that, with all his gaiety, he felt it incumbent on him to\r\nuse his pen as an implement of what he thought reform. Indeed, it was a\r\nwell-known characteristic of his, that he disliked being talked of as \"a\r\nwit.\" He thought (with justice) that he had something better in him than\r\nmost wits, and he sacredly cherished high aspirations. To him buffoonery\r\nwas pollution. He attached to _salt_ something of the sacredness which\r\nit bears in the East. He was fuller of repartee than any man in England,\r\nand yet was about the last man that would have condescended to be what\r\nis called a \"diner-out\". It is a fact which illustrates his mind, his\r\ncharacter, and biography.\r\n\r\nThe \"Q.\" papers, I say, were the first essays which attracted attention\r\nin \"Punch.\" In due time followed his \"Punch's Letters to his Son,\" and\r\n\"Complete Letter-Writer,\" with the \"Story of a Feather\", mentioned above.\r\nA basis of philosophical observation, tinged with tenderness, and a dry,\r\nironical humor,--all, like the Scottish lion in heraldry, \"within a double\r\ntressure-fleury and counter-fleury\" of wit and fancy,--such is a Jerroldian\r\npaper of the best class in \"Punch.\" It stands out by itself from all\r\nthe others,--the sharp, critical knowingness, sparkling with puns, of à\r\nBeckett,--the inimitable, wise, easy, playful, worldly, social sketch of\r\nThackeray. In imagery he had no rivals there; for his mind had a very\r\nmarked tendency to the ornamental and illustrative,--even to the grotesque.\r\nIn satire, again, he had fewer competitors than in humor;--sarcasms lurk\r\nunder his similes, like wasps in fruit or flowers. I will just quote one\r\nspecimen from a casual article of his, because it happens to occur to my\r\nmemory, and because it illustrates his manner. The \"Chronicle\" had been\r\nattacking some artists in whom he took an interest. In replying, he set\r\nout by telling how in some vine countries they repress the too luxuriant\r\ngrowths by sending in asses to crop the shoots. Then he remarked gravely,\r\nthat young artists required pruning, and added, \"How thankful we ought all\r\nto be that the 'Chronicle' keeps a donkey!\" This is an average specimen of\r\nhis playful way of ridiculing. In sterner moods he was grander. Of a Jew\r\nmoney-lender he said, that \"he might die like Judas, but that he had no\r\nbowels to gush out\";--also, that \"he would have sold our Saviour for _more\r\nmoney_.\" An imaginative color distinguished his best satire, and it had the\r\ndeadly and wild glitter of war-rockets. This was the most original quality,\r\ntoo, of his satire, and just the quality which is least common in our\r\npresent satirical literature. He had read the old writers,--Browne, Donne,\r\nFuller, and Cowley,--and was tinged with that richer and quainter vein\r\nwhich so emphatically distinguishes them from the prosaic wits of our day.\r\nHis weapons reminded you of Damascus rather than Birmingham.\r\n\r\nA wit with a mission,--this was the position of Douglas in the last years\r\nof his life. Accordingly he was a little ashamed of the immense success of\r\nthe \"Caudle Lectures,\"--the fame of which I remember being bruited about\r\nthe Mediterranean in 1845,--and which, as social drolleries, set nations\r\nlaughing. Douglas took their celebrity rather sulkily. He did not like\r\nto be talked of as a funny man. However, they just hit the reading\r\nEnglish,--always domestic in their literary as in their other tastes,--and\r\nso helped to establish \"Punch\" and to diffuse Jerrold's name. He began\r\nnow to be a Power in popular literature; and coming to be associated\r\nwith the _liberal_ side of \"Punch,\" especially, the Radicals throughout\r\nBritain hailed him as a chief. Hence, in due course, his newspaper and\r\nhis magazine,--both of which might have been permanently successful\r\nestablishments, had his genius for business borne any proportion to his\r\ngenius for literature.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was by no manner of means the case. His nature was\r\naltogether that of a literary man and artist. He could not speak in public.\r\nHe could not manage money matters. He could only write and talk,--and\r\nthese rather as a kind of _improvvisatore_, than as a steady, reading,\r\nbookish man, like a Mackintosh or a Macaulay. His politics partook of this\r\ncharacter, and I always used to think that it was a queer destiny which\r\nmade him a Radical teacher. The Radical literature of England is, with few\r\nexceptions, of a prosaic character. The most famous school of radicalism\r\nis utilitarian and systematic. Douglas was, emphatically, neither. He\r\nwas impulsive, epigrammatic, sentimental. He dashed gaily against an\r\ninstitution, like a _picador_ at a bull. He never sat down, like the\r\nregular workers of his party, to calculate the expenses of monarchy or the\r\nextravagance of the civil list. He had no notion of any sort of \"economy.\"\r\nI don't know that he had ever taken up political science seriously, or that\r\nhe had any preference for one kind or form of government over another.\r\nI repeat,--his radicalism was that of a humorist. He despised big-wigs,\r\nand pomp of all sorts, and, above all, humbug and formalism. But his\r\nradicalism was important as a sign that our institutions are ceasing\r\nto be picturesque; of which, if you consider his nature, you will see\r\nthat his radicalism was a sign. And he did service to his cause. Not an\r\nabuse, whether from the corruption of something old, or the injustice of\r\nsomething new, but Douglas was out against it with his sling. He threw his\r\nthought into some epigram which stuck. Praising journalism once, he said,\r\n\"When Luther wanted to crush the Devil, didn't he throw _ink_ at him?\"\r\nRecommending Australia, he wrote, \"Earth is so kindly there, that, tickle\r\nher with a hoe, and she laughs with a harvest.\" The last of these sayings\r\nis in his best manner, and would be hard to match anywhere for grace and\r\nneatness. Here was a man to serve his cause, for he embodied its truths in\r\nforms of beauty. His use to his party could not be measured like that of\r\ncommoner men, because of the rarity and attractive nature of the gifts\r\nwhich he brought to its service. They had a kind of incalculable value,\r\nlike that of a fine day, or of starlight.\r\n\r\nHe was now immersed in literary activity. He had all kinds of work on hand.\r\nHe brought out occasionally a five-act comedy, full as usual of wit. He\r\nwrote in \"Punch,\"--started a newspaper,--started a magazine,--published\r\na romance,--all within a few years of each other. The romance was \"A Man\r\nmade of Money,\" which bids fair, I think, to be read longer than any of\r\nhis works. It is one of those fictions in which, as in \"Zanoni,\" \"Peter\r\nSchlemil,\" and others, the supernatural appears as an element, and yet is\r\nmade to conform itself in action to real and every-day life, in such a\r\nway that the understanding is not shocked, because it reassures itself by\r\nreferring the supernatural to the regions of allegory. Shall we call this a\r\nkind of bastard-allegory? Jericho, when he first appears, is a common man\r\nof the common world. He is a money-making, grasping man, yet with a bitter\r\nsavour of satire about him which raises him out of the common place.\r\nPresently it turns out, that by putting his hand to his heart he can\r\ndraw away bank-notes,--only that it is his life he is drawing away. The\r\nconception is fine and imaginative, and ought to rank with the best of\r\nthose philosophical stories so fashionable in the last century. Its\r\nworking-out in the every-day part is brilliant and pungent; and much\r\ningenuity is shown in connecting the tragic and mysterious element in\r\nJericho's life with the ordinary, vain, worldly existence of his wife\r\nand daughters. It is startling to find ourselves in the regions of the\r\nimpossible, just as we are beginning to know the persons of the fable. But\r\nthe mind reassures itself. This Jericho, with his mysterious fate,--is\r\nnot he, in this twilight of fiction, shadowing to us the real destiny of\r\nreal money-grubbers whom we may see any day about our doors? Has not the\r\nmoney become the very life of many such? And so feeling, the reader goes\r\npleasantly on,--just excited a little, and raised out of the ordinary\r\ntemperature in which fiction is read, by the mystic atmosphere through\r\nwhich he sees things,--and ends, acknowledging that with much pleasure he\r\nhas also gathered a good moral. For his mere amusement the best fireworks\r\nhave been cracking round him on his journey. In short, I esteem this\r\nJerrold's best book,--the one which contains most of his mind. Certain\r\naspects of his mind, indeed, may be seen even to better advantage in others\r\nof his works; his sentimental side, for instance, in \"Clovernook,\" where\r\nhe has let his fancy run riot like honeysuckle, and overgrow every thing;\r\nhis wit in \"Time works Wonders,\" which blazes with epigrams like Vauxhall\r\nwith lamps. But \"A Man made of Money\" is the completest of his books as\r\na creation, and the most characteristic in point of style,--is based on\r\na principle which predominated in his mind,--is the most original in\r\nimaginativeness, and the best sustained in point and neatness, of the works\r\nhe has left.\r\n\r\nDuring the years of which I have just been speaking, Jerrold lived chiefly\r\nin a villa at Putney, and afterwards at St. John's Wood,--the mention\r\nof which fact leads me to enter on a description of him in his private,\r\nsocial, and friendly relations. Now-a-days it is happily expected of every\r\nman who writes of another to recognize his humanity,--not to treat him as\r\na machine for the production of this or that--scientific, or literary, or\r\nother--material. _Homo sum_ is the motto of the biographer, and so of the\r\nhumbler biographic sketcher. Jerrold is just one of those who require and\r\nreward this kind of personal sympathy and attention;--so radiant was the\r\nman of all that he put into his books!--so quick, so warm, so full of light\r\nand life, wit and impulse! He was one of the few who in their conversation\r\nentirely come up to their renown. He sparkled wherever you touched him,\r\nlike the sea at night.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I have to remark, in treating of Jerrold the man, is the\r\nentire harmony between that figure and Jerrold the writer. He talked very\r\nmuch as he wrote, and he acted in life on the principles which he advocated\r\nin literature. He united, remarkably, simplicity of character with\r\nbrilliancy of talk. For instance, with all his success, he never sought\r\nhigher society than that which he found himself gradually and by a natural\r\nmomentum borne into, as he advanced. He never suppressed a flash of\r\nindignant sarcasm for fear of startling the \"genteel\" classes and Mrs.\r\nGrundy. He never aped aristocracy in his household. He would go to a tavern\r\nfor his oysters and a glass of punches simply as they did in Ben Jonson's\r\ndays; and I have heard of his doing so from a sensation of boredom at a\r\nvery great house indeed,--a house for the sake of an admission to which,\r\nhalf Bayswater would sell their grandmothers' bones to a surgeon. This kind\r\nof thing stamped him in our polite days as one of the old school, and was\r\nexceedingly refreshing to observe in an age when the anxious endeavour\r\nof the English middle classes is to hide their plebeian origin under a\r\nmockery of patrician elegance. He had none of the airs of success or\r\nreputation,--none of the affectations, either personal or social, which\r\nare rife everywhere. He was manly and natural,--free and off-handed to the\r\nverge of eccentricity. Independence and marked character seemed to breathe\r\nfrom the little, rather bowed figure, crowned with a lion-like head and\r\nfalling light hair,--to glow in the keen, eager, blue eyes glancing on\r\neither side as he walked along. Nothing could be less commonplace, nothing\r\nless conventional, than his appearance in a room or in the streets.\r\n\r\nHis quick, impulsive nature made him a great talker, and conspicuously\r\nconvivial,--yea, convivial, at times, up to heights of vinous glory which\r\nthe Currans and Sheridans shrank not from, but which a respectable age\r\ndiscourages. And here I must undertake the task of saying something about\r\nhis conversational wit,--so celebrated, yet so difficult (as is notoriously\r\nthe case with all wits) to do justice to on paper.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that struck you was his extreme _readiness_ in\r\nconversation. He gave the electric spark whenever you put your knuckle to\r\nhim. The first time I called on him in his house at Putney, I found him\r\nsipping claret. We talked of a certain dull fellow whose wealth made him\r\nprominent at that time. \"Yes,\" said Jerrold, drawing his finger round\r\nthe edge of his wineglass, \"_that's_ the range of his intellect,--only\r\nit had never any thing half so good in it.\" I quote this merely as one\r\nof the average _bons-mots_ which made the small change of his ordinary\r\nconversation. He would pun, too, in talk, which he scarcely ever did in\r\nwriting. Thus he extemporized as an epitaph for his friend Charles Knight,\r\n\"GOOD NIGHT!\"--When Mrs. Glover complained that her hair was turning\r\ngray,--from using essence of lavender (as she said),--he asked her \"whether\r\nit wasn't essence of thyme?\" On the occasion of starting a convivial club,\r\n(he was very fond of such clubs,) somebody proposed that it should consist\r\nof twelve members, and be called \"The Zodiac,\"--each member to be named\r\nafter a sign. \"And what shall I be?\" inquired a somewhat solemn man, who\r\nfeared that they were filled up. \"Oh, we'll bring you in as the weight\r\nin Libra,\" was the instant remark of Douglas. A noisy fellow had long\r\ninterrupted a company in which he was. At last the bore said of a certain\r\ntune, \"It carries me away with it.\" \"For God's sake,\" said Jerrold, \"let\r\nsomebody whistle it.\"--Such _dicteria_, as the Romans called them, bristled\r\nover his talk. And he flashed them out with an eagerness, and a quiver of\r\nhis large, somewhat coarse mouth, which it was quite dramatic to see. His\r\nintense chuckle showed how hearty was his gusto for satire, and that wit\r\nwas a regular habit of his mind.\r\n\r\nI shall set down here some _Jerroldiana_ current in London,--some heard by\r\nmyself, or otherwise well authenticated. Remember how few we have of George\r\nSelwyn's, Hanbury Williams's, Hook's, or indeed any body's, and you will\r\nnot wonder that my handful is not larger.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the well-known \"Letters\" of Miss Martineau and Atkinson appeared,\r\nJerrold observed that their creed was, \"There is no God, and Miss Martineau\r\nis his prophet.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I have had such a curious dinner!\" said C. \"Calves' tails.\"--\"Extremes\r\nmeet,\" Douglas said, instantly.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe admired Carlyle; but objected that he did not give definite suggestions\r\nfor the improvement of the age which he rebuked. \"Here,\" said he, \"is a man\r\nwho beats a big drum under my windows, and when I come running down stairs\r\nhas nowhere for me to go.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA wild Republican said profanely, that Louis Blanc was \"next to Jesus\r\nChrist\"--\"On which side?\" asked the wit.\r\n\r\n\r\nPretty Miss ----, the actress, being mentioned, he praised her early\r\nbeauty. \"She was a lovely little thing,\" he said, \"when she was a _bud_,\r\nand\"--(a pause)--\"before she was a _blowen'_.\"--This was in a very merry\r\nvein, and the serious reader must forgive me.\r\n\r\n\r\nHe called a small, thin London _littérateur_ of his acquaintance, \"a pin\r\nwithout the head or the point.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen a plain, not to say ugly, gentleman intimated his intention of being\r\ngodfather to somebody's child, Jerrold begged him not to give the youngster\r\nhis \"mug.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA dedication to him being spoken of,--\"Ah!\" said he, with mock gravity,\r\n\"that's an awful power that ---- has in his hands!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCarlyle and a much inferior man being coupled by some sapient review as\r\n\"biographers,\"--\"Those two joined!\" he exclaimed. \"You can't plough with an\r\nox and an ass.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is the legacy to be paid immediately?\" inquired somebody,--_apropos_ of a\r\nwill which made some noise.--\"Yes, on the coffin-nail,\" answered he.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing told that a recent play had been \"done to order,\"--he observed, that\r\n\"it would be done to a good many 'orders,' he feared.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may be honestly said that these are average specimens of the\r\npleasantries which flowed from him in congenial society. His talk was full\r\nof such, among friends and acquaintance, and he certainly enjoyed the\r\napplause which they excited. But in his graver and tenderer moods, in the\r\ncountry walks and lounges of which he was fond, his range was higher and\r\ndeeper. For a vein of natural poetry and piety ran through the man,--wit\r\nand satirist as he was,--and appeared in his speech, occasionally, as in\r\nhis writings.\r\n\r\nA long habit of indulgence in epigram had made him rather apt to quiz\r\nhis friends. But we are to remember that he was encouraged in this, and\r\nthat a self-indulgent man is only too liable to have the nicety of his\r\nsensitiveness spoiled. Certainly, he had a kind heart and good principles.\r\nHe would lend any man money, or give any man help,--even to the extent\r\nof weakness and imprudence. This was one reason why he died no better\r\noff,--and one reason why his friends have so much exerted themselves to pay\r\na tribute to his memory in the shape of an addition to the provision he had\r\nmade for his family. The quickness of feeling which belonged to him made\r\nhim somewhat ready to take offence. But if he was easily ruffled, he was\r\neasily smoothed. Of few men could you say, that their natural impulses were\r\nbetter, or that, given such a nature and such a fortune, they would have\r\narrived at fifty-four years of age with so young a heart.\r\n\r\nThe last literary event of any magnitude in Jerrold's life was his assuming\r\nthe editorship of \"Lloyd's Newspaper.\" This journal, which before his\r\nconnection with it had no position to brag of, rose under his hands to\r\ngreat circulation and celebrity. Every week, there you traced his hand\r\nat its old work of embroidering with queer and fanciful sarcasm some bit\r\nof what he thought timely and necessary truth. Against all tyrants, all\r\nbig-wigged impostors, black, white, or gray, was his hammer ringing, and\r\nsparks of wit were flying about as ever under his hand. He was getting up\r\nin years; but still there seemed many to be hoped for him, yet. Though not\r\nso active in schemes as formerly, he still talked of works to be done; and\r\nat \"Our Club,\" and such-like friendly little associations, the wit was\r\nall himself, and came to our stated meetings as punctually as a star to\r\nits place in the sky. He had suffered severely from illness, especially\r\nfrom rheumatism, at various periods of life; and he had lived freely and\r\njoyously, as was natural to a man of his peculiar gifts. But, _death_! We\r\nnever thought of the brilliant and radiant Douglas in connection with the\r\nblack river. He would have sunk Charon's boat with a shower of epigrams,\r\none would have fancied, if the old fellow, with his squalid beard, had\r\ndared to ask him into the stern-sheets. To more than one man who knew him\r\nintimately the first announcement of his decease was made by the \"Times.\"\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the 19th of May, I met him,--as I frequently did on\r\nSaturday evenings,--and on no evening do I remember him more lively and\r\nbrilliant. Next Saturday, I believe, he was at the same kindly board; but\r\nsome accident kept me away;--I never saw him again. Soon after, he was\r\ntaken ill. There passed a week of much suffering. June had come, warm\r\nand rainy, but our friend was dying. The nature of the illness might be\r\ndoubtful, but there could be no doubt that the end was near. He prepared\r\nhimself to meet it. He sent friendly messages of farewell to those he\r\nloved, begging, too, that if what he had ever said had pained any one, he\r\nmight now be forgiven. His mind was made up, and his children were all\r\nabout him. On a fine evening in the first week of June, he was moved to the\r\nwindow, that he might see the sun setting. On Monday, the eighth of that\r\nmonth, being perfectly conscious almost till the very last, he died.\r\n\r\nThe time is not yet come to discuss what his ultimate place will be in\r\nthe literature of his century. It will not be denied that he was a man of\r\nrare gifts, and of a remarkable experience in life; and his life and the\r\npopularity of his writings will by and by help posterity to understand\r\nthis our generation. Meanwhile I shall leave him in his resting-place in\r\nNorwood, among the hills and fields of Surrey, near the grave of the friend\r\nof his youth, the gentle and gifted Laman Blanchard, where he was laid on\r\nthe 15th of June, amidst a concourse of people not often assembled round\r\nthe remains of one who has begun life as humbly as he did.\r\n\r\nHis death made a great impression; and the acuteness with which his friends\r\nfelt it said more than could be said in a long dissertation for the kindly\r\nand love-inspiring qualities of the man. As soon as it appeared that his\r\nfamily were left in less prosperous circumstances than had been hoped,\r\ntheir interest took an active form. A committee met to organize a plan\r\nby which the genius of those who had known Jerrold might be employed in\r\nraising a provision for his family. The rest has been duly recorded in the\r\nnewspapers, where the success of these benevolent exertions may be read.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORENTINE MOSAICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL.\r\n\r\nThe capital of Tuscany--according to its most respectable and veracious\r\nchroniclers--is the oldest city extant. Its history is traced with great\r\naccuracy up to the Deluge, which is as much as could be reasonably\r\nexpected. The egg of Florence is Fiesole. This city, according to the\r\nconscientious and exhaustive Villani, [Footnote: Cronica. Lib. I. c. vii.]\r\nwas built by a grandson of Noah, Attalus by name, who came into Italy in\r\norder \"to avoid the confusion occasioned by the building of the Tower of\r\nBabel.\" [Footnote: \"per evitare la confusione creata per la edificazione\r\ndella torre di Babel,\" etc.] Noah and his wife had, however, already made\r\na visit to Tuscany, soon after the Deluge; so that it is not remarkable\r\nthat \"King Attalus\" should have felt inclined to visit the estates of his\r\nancestor. At the same time, it is obvious that the Noahs had not been\r\nsatisfied with the locality, and had reëmigrated; for Attalus, upon his\r\narrival, found Italy entirely without inhabitants. He, therefore, with\r\ngreat propriety claimed jurisdiction over the whole country, elected\r\nhimself king, and his wife Electra queen; built himself a palace, with a\r\ncity attached to it; and in short, made himself, generally, at home. We\r\nare also fortunate in having some genealogical particulars as to his wife's\r\nantecedents; and it is to be regretted that modern historians, of the\r\nskeptical, the irreverent, and the startling schools, could not imitate\r\nthe gravity, the good faith, and the respect for things established, by\r\nwhich the elder chroniclers were inspired. The apothecaries of the Middle\r\nAges never dealt so unkindly with the Pharaohs of Egypt, as the historical\r\nexcavators of more recent times have done with the embalmed, crowned, and\r\nconsecrated mummies which they have been pleased to denounce as delusions.\r\nYour Potiphars or your Mizraims, even when converted into balsam, or\r\nemployed as a styptic, were at least not denuded of their historical\r\nidentity by the druggists who reduced their time-honored remains to\r\na powder. Their dust was made merchandise, but their characters were\r\nrespected. Moreover, there was an object and a motive, even if mistaken\r\nones, on the part of the mediæval charlatans. But what ointment, what\r\nsoothing syrup, what panacea has been the result of all this pulverizing of\r\nSemiramis and Sardanapalus, Mucius Scævola and Junius Brutus? Are all the\r\ncharacters graven so deeply by the stylus of Clio upon so many monumental\r\ntablets, and almost as indelibly and quite as painfully upon school-boy\r\nmemory, to be sponged out at a blow, like chalk from a blackboard? We, at\r\nleast, cling fondly to our Tarquins; we shudder when the abyss of historic\r\nincredulity swallows up the familiar form of Mettus Curtius; we refuse to\r\nbe weaned from the she-wolf of Romulus. Your unbelieving Guy Faux, who\r\napproaches the stately superstructures of history, not to gaze upon them\r\nwith the eye of faith and veneration, but only that he may descend to the\r\nvaults, with his lantern and his keg of critical gunpowder, in order to\r\nblow the whole fabric sky-high,--such an ill-conditioned trouble-tomb\r\nshould be burned in effigy once a year.\r\n\r\nElectra, then, wife of Attalus, founder and king of Fiesole, was of very\r\nbrilliant origin, being no less than one of the Pleiades, and the only one\r\nof the sisters who seems to have married into a patriarchal family. \"The\r\nreason why the seven stars are seven is a pretty reason\"; but it is not\r\n\"because they are not eight,\" as Lear suggests, but, as we now discover\r\nby patient investigation, because one of them had married and settled in\r\nTuscany. We are not informed whether the lost Pleiad, thus found on the\r\nArno, was happy or not, after her removal from that more elevated sphere\r\nwhich she had just begun to move in. But if respectability of connection\r\nand a pleasant locality be likely to insure contentment to a fallen star,\r\nwe have reason to believe that she found herself more comfortable than\r\nLucifer was after his emigration.\r\n\r\nGreat care must be taken not to confound Attalus with Tantalus,--a blunder\r\nwhich, as Villani observes, [Footnote: Cron. Lib. I. c. vii.] is often\r\ncommitted by ignorant chroniclers. But Tantalus, as we all very well know,\r\nwas the son of Jupiter, and grandson of Saturn. Now we are quite sure\r\nthat Noah never married a daughter of Saturn, because that voracious\r\nheathen ate up all his children except Jupiter. This simple fact precludes\r\nall possibility of a connection with Saturn by the mother's side, and\r\nillustrates the advantage of patient historical investigation, when founded\r\nupon a reverence for traditional authority. Had it not been for such an\r\nhonest chronicler as Giovanni Villani, our historic thirst might have been\r\ntantalized for seven centuries longer with this delusion. Certainly, to\r\nconfound Tantalus, ancestor of all the Trojans, with Attalus, ancestor of\r\nall the Tuscans, would be worse than that \"confusion of Babel\" which the\r\nquiet-loving potentate came to Florence to avoid.\r\n\r\nAttalus brought with him from Babel an eminent astrologer and civil\r\nengineer, who assured him, after careful experiments, that, of all places\r\nin Europe, the mount of Fiesole was the healthiest and the best. He was\r\ntherefore ordered to build the city there at once. When finished, it was\r\ncalled _Fia sola_, because of its solitariness; Attalus, in consequence\r\nof his participation in the Babel confusion, having become familiar with\r\nTuscan several thousand years before that language was invented. The city,\r\nthus auspiciously established, flourished forty or fifty centuries, more\r\nor less, without the occurrence of any event worth recording, down to the\r\ntime of Catiline. The Fiesolans, unfortunately, aided and comforted that\r\nconspirator in his designs against Rome, and were well punished for their\r\ncrime by Julius Cæsar, who battered their whole town about their ears, in\r\nconsequence, and then ploughed up their territory, and sowed it with salt.\r\nThe harvest of that agricultural operation was reaped by Florence; for the\r\nconqueror immediately afterwards, by command of the Roman Senate, converted\r\na little suburb at the bottom of the hill into a city. Into this the\r\nFiesolans removed at once, and found themselves very comfortable there;\r\nbeing saved the trouble of going up and down a mountain every time they\r\ncame out and went home again. Florence took its name from one Fiorino,\r\nmarshal of the camp, in the Roman army, who was killed in the battle of\r\nFiesole. As he was the flower of chivalry, his name was thought of good\r\naugury; the more so, as roses and lilies sprang forth plenteously from the\r\nspot where he fell. Hence the fragrant and poetical name which the City of\r\nFlowers has retained until our days; and hence the cognizance of the three\r\nflowers-de-luce which it has borne upon its shield. Julius Cæsar, whose\r\nsword had severed the infant city from its dead mother in so Cæsarean a\r\nfashion, had set his heart upon calling the town after himself, and took\r\nthe contrary decree of the Roman Senate very much in dudgeon. He therefore\r\nleft the country in a huff, and revenged himself by annihilating vast\r\nnumbers of unfortunate Gauls, Britons, Germans, and other barbarians, who\r\nhappened to come in his way.\r\n\r\nThe first public edifice of any importance erected in the city was a temple\r\nto Mars, with a colossal statue of that divinity in the midst of it. This\r\nis the present baptistery, formerly cathedral, of Saint John; for the\r\ntemple never was destroyed, and never can be destroyed, until the day of\r\njudgment. This we know on the authority of more than one eminent historian.\r\nIt is also proved by an inscription to that effect in the mosaic pavement,\r\nwhich any one may inspect who chooses to do so. [Footnote: Villani, Cron.\r\nLib. I. c. xlii.]\r\n\r\nThe town was utterly destroyed A.D. 450, by Totila, _Flagellum Dei_,\r\nwho, with great want of originality, immediately rebuilt Fiesole; thus\r\nrepeating, but reversing, the achievement of the Romans five hundred years\r\nbefore. So Fiesole and Florence seem to have alternately filled and emptied\r\nthemselves, like two buckets in a well, down to the time of Charlemagne.\r\nThat emperor rebuilt Florence, but experienced some difficulty in doing\r\nso, by reason of the statue of Mars, which had been thrown into the Arno.\r\nThe temple, converted to Christian purposes, had been the only building to\r\nescape the wrath of Totila; but owing to the pagan incantations practised\r\nwhen the town was originally consecrated to the god of war, the statue of\r\nthat divinity would not consent to lie quietly and ignominiously in the bed\r\nof the Arno, while his temple and town were appropriated to other purposes.\r\nThe river was dragged. The statue was found and set upon a column near the\r\nedge of the river, on a spot which is now the head of the Ponte Vecchio.\r\nTrue to its pugnacious character, it brought nothing but turbulence and\r\nbloodshed upon the town. The long and memorable feuds between the Guelphs\r\nand Ghibellines began by the slaying of Buondelmonte in his wedding dress,\r\nat the base of the statue. (A.D. 1215.)\r\n\r\nThere could be no better foundation for romance or drama than the famous\r\nBuondelmonte marriage, before which, sings Dante, Florence had never cause\r\nto shed a tear, and after which the white lily of her escutcheon was dyed\r\nred in her heart's blood. There were four noble families in Florence, of\r\nsurpassing importance,--the Buondelmonti, the Uberti, the Donati, and the\r\nAmidei. A match-making widow of the Donati has a daughter of extraordinary\r\nbeauty, whom she intends to bestow in marriage upon the young chief of the\r\nBuondelmonti. Before she has time to complete her arrangements, however,\r\nBuondelmonte betroths himself to a daughter of the house of Amidei. Signora\r\nDonati waylays him, as he passes the door, and suddenly displays to him the\r\nfatal beauty of her daughter. \"She should have been your bride,\" said the\r\nwidow, \"had you not been so hasty.\" The gentleman, dazzled by the beauty\r\nof the girl, and satisfied by the prudent mother as to the dowry, marries\r\nSignorina Donati upon the spot. Next day, riding across the Ponte Vecchio\r\nupon a white horse, he is beset by a party of friends and relatives of\r\nthe deserted damsel, and killed close by the statue of Mars. All the\r\nnobles of Florence take part in the question; upon one side the Nerli, the\r\nFrescobaldi, the ----; but \"courage, gentle reader,\" as Tristram Shandy\r\nobserves, in his famous historical chapter upon Calais; \"I scorn it; 'tis\r\nenough to have thee in my power; but to make use of the advantage which the\r\nfortune of the pen has now gained over thee would be too much.\"\r\n\r\nThirty years long, then, the town gates were all fastened, and the streets\r\nall chained, so as to make many little compact inclosures for slaughtering\r\npurposes; while the whites and blacks, Guelphs and Ghibellines, red caps\r\nand brown, all buffeted each other pell-mell. To the exhaustion thus\r\nproduced of noble blood is often ascribed the establishment of a popular\r\ngovernment at the close of the thirteenth century. The causes lay really\r\nmuch deeper, however,--in the great revolutions consequent upon the\r\nextinction of the Suabian dynasty, and in the wonderful progress in culture\r\nmade by the Florentine democracy.\r\n\r\n    O Buondelmonte, quanto mal fuggisti\r\n    Le nozze sue per gli altrui conforti!\r\n  Molti sarebber lieti, che son tristi,\r\n    Se Dio t' avesse conceduto ad Ema\r\n    La prima volta ch' a città venisti.\r\n  Ma conveniasi a quella pietra scema\r\n    Che guarda il ponte, che Fiorenza fesse\r\n    Vittima nella sua pace postrema.\r\n  Con queste genti, e con altre con esse,\r\n    Vid' io Fiorenza in sì fatto riposo,\r\n    Che non avea cagione onde piangesse.\r\n  Con queste genti vid' io glorioso\r\n    E giusto il popol suo tanto, che 'l giglio\r\n    Non era ad asta mai posto a ritroso,\r\n  Nè per division fatto vermiglio.\r\n               _Paradiso_, XVI. 140-154.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nSAN MINIATO.\r\n\r\nThe walk to the church of San Miniato is a paved, steep path, through\r\nolive orchards fringed by a row of cypresses, to the little church of\r\nSan Salvadore; thence, through a garden of roses and cabbages, fresh and\r\nfragrant in the December sun, to the convent of Miniato. From the terrace\r\nis one of the best views of the city; not so fine, however, as that from\r\nBello Sguardo. The gentle, beautiful chain of hills which encircle Florence\r\nsmile cheerfully in the sunshine, clapping their hands and skipping like\r\nlambs, if little hills ever did make such a demonstration. These environs\r\nof the town are like a frame of golden filigree, almost too fantastic a one\r\nfor so shadowy and sombre a city. The green hill-sides and plains are sown\r\nthickly with palaces and villas glancing whitely through silvery forests of\r\nolives and myrtle; while the distant Apennines, like guardian giants, lift\r\ntheir icy shields in the distance.\r\n\r\nThe church is built upon the grave of the eminent saint, Miniato. This\r\npersonage was, it seems, the son of the king of Armenia,--very much as all\r\nthe heroes in the Arabian Nights are sons of the emperor of China. Having\r\nbeen converted to Christianity, he was offered by the emperor Decius great\r\nhonors and rewards suitable to his royal rank, if he would renounce his\r\nfaith. (A.D. 250.) He refused, and the emperor cut off his head. The\r\nexecution took place in Florence, on the north side of the Arno. The holy\r\nman was not so easily disposed of, however; for he immediately clapped his\r\nhead upon his shoulders again, and holding it on with both hands, waded\r\nacross the river, and marched steadily up the hill on the other side.\r\nArrived at the top, he gave up his head and the ghost. Hence the convent\r\nand church of San Miniato.\r\n\r\nThe church, to an architectural student, is interesting and important. A\r\nman needs a good eye and a good education to feel and thoroughly appreciate\r\nthe grand symphonies which this wonderful architectural music of the Middle\r\nAges has so long been silently playing. San Miniato belongs to the close of\r\nthe Romanesque or Latin period. The early Christian school had expired in\r\nthe midst of the general convulsions of the ninth and tenth centuries,--in\r\nthe struggles of an effete and expiring antiquity with the brutal,\r\nblundering, but vigorous infancy of mediæval Europe. During the three\r\ncenturies which succeeded, there was rather a warming into unnatural life\r\nof the mighty corpse, than the birth of a new organism, capable of healthy\r\nexistence and unlimited reproduction. The Romanesque art seems to have\r\ndealt with the ancient forms, without moulding any thing essentially\r\nand vitally new. Where there seemed originality, it was, after all,\r\nonly a theft from the Saracenic or Byzantine, and the plagiarism became\r\nincongruity when engrafted upon the Roman. Thus a Latin church was often\r\nbut an early Christian _basilica_ with a Moorish arcade.\r\n\r\nThe San Miniato has an arcade, of course not pointed, upon the façade and\r\nthe interior. Its tessellated marble work, its ancient mosaics, with its\r\nRoman capitals and columns, all make it interesting. These last show that\r\nat the close of the epoch, even as at its beginning, the chain which binds\r\nthe school to the ancient Roman is fastened anew.\r\n\r\nThe frescos in the sacristy, by Spinello Aretino, painted at the end of the\r\nfourteenth century, are singularly well preserved,--fresh as if painted\r\nyesterday. 'Tis a great pity that the works of other masters of the same\r\nage, Spinello's superiors, could not have been as fortunate. If the frescos\r\nof Orgagna, and of Benozzo Gozzoli in the Campo Santo at Pisa, were in as\r\ngood condition, it would be much more satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThese pictures of Spinello are drawn with much boldness and energy, but it\r\nis not the fortunate audacity of Orgagna. They are much more the work of\r\na mechanic, not self-distrustful, but with comparatively little feeling\r\nfor the higher range of artistic expression. They are quite destitute of\r\nsentiment, but are not without a strong, rough, hardy humor. The drawing\r\nis far from accurate, but the coloring is well laid on. They represent the\r\nlife and adventures of Saint Benedict, are of colossal size, and depict the\r\nsaint in various striking positions. Here he is portrayed as rescuing a\r\nbrother friar from the inconveniences resulting from a house having fallen\r\nupon him; in another he is miraculously mending a crockery jug belonging\r\nto his nurse; and in a third he is unsuccessfully attempting to move a\r\nlarge stone, upon which the Devil has seated himself, much to Benedict's\r\ndiscomfiture. The fiend is drawn, _con amore_, in black, with hairy hide,\r\nbat's wings, and a monkey's tail; the traditional Devil who has come down\r\nto us unharmed through all the vicissitudes of the Middle Ages. The saints\r\nand friars are generally attired in mazarine blue.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nACADEMY OF THE FINE ARTS.\r\n\r\nThere is here a large hall, containing a brief chronicle of the progress of\r\npainting from Cimabue to--Carlo Dolce! There may be a still deeper descent;\r\nbut that is bathos sufficient for any lover of his species.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable to look at these painters of the thirteenth, fourteenth,\r\nand fifteenth centuries with some reference to the political condition of\r\nFlorence and of Italy at that time. In truth, Florence during the period of\r\nits life _was_ Italy,--the _vivida vis_, creative, contemplative, ornative,\r\nimpulsive to the clay of Europe. The art of painting seems to spring\r\nfull-grown into existence, with the appearance of Cimabue in the latter\r\npart of the thirteenth century. Even so the Italian language suddenly\r\ncrystallizes itself into a brilliant and perpetual type, at the same epoch\r\nas the wondrous poem of Dante flashes forth from the brooding chaos,--the\r\n_fiat lux_ of a new intellectual world.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Frederic II., last of the imperial Hohenstaufens, died in 1250.\r\nChivalrous, adventurous, despotic, as became the head of the conquering\r\nGerman races at their epoch of triumph,--imaginative, poetical, debauched,\r\natheistical, as might be expected of a prince born in Italy, he seemed to\r\njustify the somewhat incongruous eagerness with which the Florentine mind\r\nsought political salvation in the bosom of the Church. Yet here seems the\r\nfatal flaw in the liberal system of Italy at that period. The Ghibelline\r\nparty was at least consistent. To be an imperialist, a Hohenstaufenite,\r\nwas at least definite; as much so as to be an absolutist, a Habsburgite,\r\na Napoleonite to-day. But to be a Guelph,--to be in favor of municipal\r\ndevelopment, local self-government, intellectual progress, and to fight for\r\nall these things under the banner of the Church, in an age which witnessed\r\nthe establishment of the Inquisition, in an age when the mighty spirit of\r\nHildebrand was rising every day from his grave in more and more influential\r\nand imposing shape,--this was to place one's self in a false position.\r\nDante, no doubt, felt all this to the core of his being. A poet by nature,\r\nwith that intense, morbid, proud, uncomfortable, alternately benevolent\r\nand misanthropical temperament which occasionally accompanies the poetic\r\nfaculty, he had little in common with the bustling, vivacious character\r\nof his fellow-townsmen. _Fiorentino di nascita, non di costumi_, as he\r\ndescribes himself, he had slight sympathy with Blacks or Whites, Guelphs\r\nor Ghibellines. A Guelph by birth, a Ghibelline by banishment, he was in\r\nreality an absolutist in politics, and a bigot in religion. Had a hell\r\nnever been heard of, he would have invented one, for the mere comfort of\r\nroasting his enemies in it, and his friends along with them,--the solitary\r\nenjoyment of his lifetime. His part in public affairs has been much\r\nmagnified. He was prior in 1300; but almost any citizen of Florence might\r\nbe prior. He was once sent to Rome, on a diplomatic errand; but he was\r\nonly the envoy of a party, only one of a set of delegates appointed by\r\nthe Whites. He was banished for his political opinions, and afterwards\r\ncondemned to death; but even this was no distinction; for six hundred other\r\npersons, most of them obscure men, were included in the same sentence,\r\nfor the same offence. They all happened, in short, to belong to the party\r\nopposed to the one which was successful. His merits of style can hardly\r\nbe exaggerated. Alone of mankind he almost created a language. Imagine\r\nthe English, or the German, or the French poetry of the year 1300 flowing\r\nmusically and familiarly from the lips of 1857! The culture, too, of\r\nhis epoch might almost be measured by his personal accomplishments. The\r\nAristotle, the Bacon, the Humboldt of Florence was one of the world's\r\ngreat poets into the bargain; but he was any thing but a statesman or a\r\npolitician.\r\n\r\nIn his poetry, accordingly, written when the Florentine democracy was\r\nyoung, vigorous, and mischievous, there is no chord of sympathy with\r\nthe polity of his native place. On the contrary, the whole magnificent\r\n\"Commedia\" is a _De profundis_ chanted out of an oppressed and scornful\r\nbosom, a fiery protest, an excoriating satire against the liberty upon\r\nwhich the Commonwealth prided itself. Florence banished and would have\r\nburned her poet. The poet banished and burned Florence in the great hell\r\nwhich his imagination created and peopled. His ashes,--so often and so\r\nvainly implored for by the repentant and sorrowing mother, who had driven\r\nhim from her bosom with curses, to wander and to starve, \"to eat the bitter\r\nbread of exile, and to feel that sharpest arrow in the bow of exile, the\r\ngoing up and down in another's house,\"--his ashes are not the property of\r\nthe Republic. Are his laurels? Yes. The \"Divina Commedia\" is a splendid\r\nproof of the vitality which pervades a republican atmosphere. There was\r\nlittle of justice perhaps, and less of security and comfort; but there was\r\nat any rate life, intellectual development, thought, pulsation, fierce\r\ncollision of mind with mind, attrition of human passions and divine\r\nfaculties, out of which an elemental fire was created which flamed over the\r\ncivilized world, and has lighted the torches of civilization for centuries.\r\nHe who would study the _artes humaniores_ must turn of necessity to two\r\nfountain heads; and he finds them in the trampled marketplaces of two\r\nnoisy, turbulent, unreasonable, pestilent little democratic cities,--Athens\r\nand Florence. Extinguish the architecture and the sculpture, the poetry and\r\nthe philosophy of Attica; obliterate from the sum of civilization the names\r\nof Dante, Boccaccio, Petrarch, Machiavelli,--of Cimabue, Giotto, Leonardo\r\nda Vinci, Brunelleschi, Michel Angelo,--of Brunetto, Ficino, Politian; and\r\nhow much diminished will be the remainder!\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is in vain to look for any special seal set by the spirit\r\nof liberty upon the artistic productions of the earlier age in Florence.\r\nThe works of the great painters bear the impress of the Church. If the\r\nspirit of liberty be present at all, it is veiled and hooded by monastic\r\ngarments. But it should never be forgotten, that, in this age, the Church\r\nembodied an element of liberty. The keys of Saint Peter were brandished\r\nagainst the universal sceptre of the Suabians; cultivated intellect was\r\nmatched, and often successfully, against brutal violence. The Pope was the\r\nrival of Cæsar.\r\n\r\nThe first great painting in the Academy--to return from this digression--is\r\nthe famous Madonna of Cimabue. This picture is astonishing. Although\r\nconsidered by many critics to manifest lingering traces of the Byzantine\r\nbandages, it seems to us, on the contrary, to be wonderfully free from\r\nstiffness and conventionality. The genius of Cimabue extricates itself at a\r\nbound from the trammels of preceding systems, and flies vigorously towards\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna is colossal. She wears a hood, and holds her child in her\r\narms. There is a strong human, yet spiritualized expression upon the face.\r\nThe drapery is gracefully arranged, not folded like mummy cloths; and the\r\ncolor is strong and liberally laid on, without any attempt, however, at\r\ntransparency of shadow. There is little indication of the technical glories\r\nof succeeding centuries. Perhaps the best part of the picture is in the\r\nlower margin. Here are four heads of saints, painted with a breadth and\r\nenergy absolutely startling, when one recollects by whom and when they were\r\nexecuted. Dominic Ghirlandaio, two hundred years later, could hardly have\r\nput more masculine expression into a quartet of heads.\r\n\r\nGiotto's Madonna is the pendant to that of Cimabue; but although painted\r\ntwenty-five years later, it shows less progress in art than might be\r\nexpected. Giotto's triumphs are to be found in the frescos of the\r\nSanta Croce. In that unequalled series, the art-student recognizes,\r\nalmost at a glance, the power of the master. Largeness, rhythm, and\r\nharmony of composition,--dramatic movement, and individual beauty of\r\nexpression,--heads which have brains, eyes which can smile, lips which can\r\nspeak, fluent limbs which can move, or remain in natural repose,--the whole\r\nsurrounded and inspired by that atmosphere of piety, that effluence of\r\nreligious ecstasy, which can never be imitated, and which came from the\r\nunquestioning faith of the artist;--such wonders were for the first time\r\nrevealed by Giotto. The shepherd boy, whom Cimabue found drawing pictures\r\nupon a stone in the open field, nobly repaid his patron and master, by\r\nextending still farther the domain of art,--by throwing its doors wide open\r\nto the cool breath of nature and the liberal sunshine. To pass from the\r\nByzantines into the school of Giotto is to come out from the catacombs into\r\nthe warm precincts of the cheerful day.\r\n\r\nOf the pictures of the early part of the fifteenth century, none are\r\nmore worthy of attention in this collection than those of Fra Angelico\r\nof Fiesole. (1387-1455.) Nevertheless, it seems no great progress from\r\nCimabue, Giotto, and Orgagna, whose compositions are so full of energetic\r\nlife and human passion, to these careful, gentle miniatures upon an\r\nexpanded scale. The Fra was a _miniatore_, after all,--a manuscript\r\nilluminator of the first class. His effort to represent a descent from the\r\ncross in a large and dramatic manner is feeble and flat. This flight seems\r\nbeyond his strength; and his waxy little wings, which sustained him so well\r\nwithin his own sphere, melted at once in this higher region.\r\n\r\nFar better is an exquisite little picture in his very best manner, a\r\nwork which hangs in the apartment De' Piccoli Quadri. This is a Judgment\r\nDay, and a cheerful painting of its class. There is an old conceit, very\r\ncleverly carried out through the whole composition, of representing all the\r\njust made perfect as actually converted into little children. Kings with\r\ncrowns, popes, bishops, cardinals in hats and mitres, monks cowled and\r\nrobed in conventual habiliments, are all philandering together through\r\ngardens of amaranth and asphodel towards the Grecian portico of heaven; and\r\nall these fortunate personages, whether monarchs, priests, fine ladies, or\r\nbeggars, are depicted with perfectly infantine faces. To do this well lay\r\nexactly in the quaint, delicate nature of the angelic Frater; and this\r\nportion of the picture is most exquisitely handled. The other moiety, where\r\ndevils with rabbits' ears, tiger faces, and monkeys' tails, are forking\r\nover the damned into frying-pans, while Satan devours them as fast as\r\ncooked, is common-place and vulgar. At the same time, it is certain that\r\nthe whole composition shows much poetry of invention and delicacy of\r\nfinish.\r\n\r\nAndrew Castagno's Magdalen, like Donatello's Wooden Statue of the same\r\npenitent in the Baptistery, seems a female Robinson Crusoe,--hirsute,\r\ncadaverous, fleshless, uncombed and uncomely,--certainly a more edifying\r\nspectacle than the voluptuous, Titianesque exhibitions of fair frailty\r\nwhich became the fashion afterwards.\r\n\r\nOf Gentile da Fabriano, a very rare master, there hangs an Adoration of\r\nthe Magi, marked May, 1423. One always feels grateful to such of the\r\n_Quattrocentisti_ as enlarged the sphere of artistic action, by going out\r\nof the conventional circle of holy families, nativities, and entombments.\r\nThere is a dash about Gentile, a fresh, cavalier-like gentility, quite\r\nsurprising, and altogether his own. A showy, flippant frivolity in several\r\nof the figures enlivens and refreshes us with its mundane sparkle and\r\nenergy. One of the three kings, in particular,--a young, well-dressed,\r\nvivacious, _goguenard_-looking personage, with a very glittering pair of\r\nspurs, which his groom is just unbuckling, while another holds a highly\r\nbedizened war-horse, who is throwing up his head, showing all his teeth,\r\nand crying ha, ha, with all his might,--has a very dramatic effect.\r\n\r\nOf the Lippo Lippis, the Lorenzo di Credis, the Ghirlandaios, the\r\nPeruginos, and the other great masters of the fifteenth century, of whom\r\nare many masterpieces in this collection, there shall, for the present, not\r\na word be said.\r\n\r\nThere is also a portrait of Savonarola, by Fra Bartolommeo. The face is\r\nneither impressive nor attractive. The head is shorn, except the monastic\r\ncoronal, and shows a small organ of benevolence, and a very large one\r\nof self-esteem. The profile is not handsome,--the nose being regularly\r\naquiline, while the mouth is heavy with a projecting upper lip. A strong,\r\nblue beard, closely shaven, but very visible, darkens and improves the\r\nphysiognomy.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nSANTA MARIA NOVELLA.\r\n\r\nThis church was so beloved by Michel Angelo as to be called his bride. It\r\nmust be confessed that the great artist was determined in his choice less\r\nby the external charms than by the interior excellence of his _sposa_;\r\nfor although she has now got herself a new front and vamped herself up a\r\nlittle, thus looking a trifle younger than she must have done three hundred\r\nyears ago, still she has any thing but a bridal or virginal aspect.\r\n\r\nThis church and monastery belong to the earlier German period of Italy,\r\nif such a thing as Italian Gothic can be said to have ever existed. The\r\ntruth is, that with the exception of Milan cathedral, which is modern,\r\nexotic, and exceptional, the German, or, to use the common and senseless\r\nexpression, the Gothic system of architecture never fairly took root in\r\nItaly. Certainly, the pointed windows and arches of the Florence _duomo_\r\nand its _campanile_ do not constitute it a Gothic church. The square\r\ncornices, vast masses of wall, heavy pilasters, and, in general, the\r\nhorizontal outlines and heavy expression of all these churches, have\r\na character very remote from that of the airy, upspringing, fantastic\r\nGerman architecture, in which every shaft, arch, vault-girdle, pillar,\r\nwindow-frame, pinnacle, seems struggling and panting upward with an almost\r\naudible eloquence. This is not the expression of the _duomo_ here. There\r\nis no perpetual _Excelsior_ ringing from point, spire, and turret. On the\r\ncontrary, the grave, almost rigid aspect of the ancient _basilica_--the\r\nRoman business-hall, compounded of Greek elements, and transformed into a\r\nGrecian temple--is ever at work repressing that devotional ecstasy which\r\nis the characteristic of the Gothic church. The Italian language in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries was like the Italian architecture of\r\nthe same period. The different intellectual manifestations, subjected to\r\nthe same influences, obeyed one general law. The conquering German mind\r\nof the Dark Ages easily impressed itself where the soil was still virgin.\r\nThroughout _savage_ Europe the dominion was yielded at once to the new\r\npower which succeeded to the decrepit empire of Rome. Gaul, Germany,\r\nBritain, Iberia obeyed instinctively the same impulse. The children born of\r\nthat vigorous embrace were of fresh and healthy beauty. The manifestations\r\nof the German mind in the cathedrals of Paris, Cologne, Antwerp are\r\nundimmed and unrivalled. The early German architecture in the actual realms\r\nof Germany is as romantic, energetic, and edifying as its poetry at the\r\nsame epoch. A great German cathedral is a religious epic in stone. All the\r\nornaments, all the episodes, spring from and cluster around one central,\r\nlife-giving principle.\r\n\r\nIn Italy, on the other hand, the architecture of the so-called Gothic\r\nperiod embodies a constant struggle between the ancient and the new-born\r\nmind,--a contest in which the eventual triumph of the elder is already\r\nforeshadowed, even while the new has apparently gained the ascendency. Why\r\nwas this? Because in Italy the German conquerors had invaded the land of\r\nancient culture, of settled and organized form. The world could not be\r\ncreated _de novo_, as in the shaggy deserts of Hercynia and Belgica. The\r\nseeds of human speech, planted in those vast wildernesses, sprouted readily\r\ninto new and luxuriant languages. English, Flemish, German, French spring\r\nfrom German roots hidden in Celtic soil. The Latin element, afterwards\r\nengrafted, is exotic, excrescent, and not vital to the organization. In\r\nItaly, where a language, a grammar, a literature already existed in full\r\nforce, the German element was almost neutralized. The Goths could only\r\ndeface the noble language of Rome. They gave it auxiliary verbs,--that\r\nfeeblest form of assistance to human eloquence,--and they took away its\r\ndeclensions. Architecture presented the same phenomenon. It submitted\r\nto what seemed the German tyranny for a time, but it submitted\r\nunder a perpetual and visible protest. [Footnote: Compare Kugler,\r\n_Kunstgeschichte_, pp. 590, 591.] The Gothic details in the _campanile_\r\nand the _duomo_ look altogether extraneous and compulsory; they are not\r\nassimilated into the constitution of the structure. The severe Roman\r\nprofile is marked as distinctly as ever, notwithstanding the foreign\r\nornaments which it has been forced to assume.\r\n\r\nSanta Maria Novella, then, is as good a German Italian church as can be\r\nfound; but, for the reasons stated, it is not particularly interesting as a\r\npiece of architecture. Its wealth is in its frescos. In the quadrangle\r\nof the cloister is a series of pictures by Paolo Uccello, who, by the\r\nintroduction of linear perspective, of which he is esteemed the inventor,\r\nmade a new epoch in art. In the \"chapel of the Spaniards\" is a famous\r\ncollection of frescos by Giotto's scholars. A large, thoughtful, and\r\nattractive composition is called the Wisdom of the Church. On the opposite\r\nside is a very celebrated painting, entitled the Church Militant and\r\nTriumphant; the militating and triumphing business being principally\r\nconfided to the dogs of the Lord,--_videlicet, Domini-canes_. A large\r\nnumber of this dangerous fraternity is represented as a pack of\r\nhounds, fighting, pulling, biting, and howling most vigorously in a\r\nlife-and-death-struggle with the wolves of heresy. In the centre of the\r\ncomposition are introduced various portraits. These were thought for a\r\nlong time to represent Cimabue (in a white night-cap), Petrarch (in long\r\npetticoats), Laura (in short ones), and various other celebrities. Vasari\r\nis the original authority [Footnote: Vite da Vasari, ed. Lemonnier, 1846.\r\nSim. and Lippo Memmi, p. 90, and notes.] for this opinion, which has ceased\r\nto be entertained by _cognoscenti_. It is also no longer believed that the\r\npictures are the work of Taddeo Gaddi and Simon Memmi. The _custode_ clings\r\nto both delusions,--the portraits and the painters. Whether red Murray, and\r\nthat devoted band of English and Americans who follow his flag, patronize\r\nthe Vasari theory or more modern ones, we are at this moment unable to\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nBy what subtile threads are international hearts bound together! Two great\r\nnations have wrangled for a century; but they have a common property in\r\nShakspeare and Tupper,--and--most precious of all joint-possessions--in the\r\nhand-books of Murray. We feel with one throb upon all æsthetic subjects. We\r\nadmire the same great works of art. We drop a tear upon exactly the same\r\nspots, hallowed in ancient or modern history. The fraternity is absolute.\r\n\r\nIn the Strozzi chapel are an altar-piece and several wall-pictures by\r\nAndrew Orgagna. They are not so grandly conceived as that wondrous\r\ncomposition of his, the Triumph of Death, in the Pisan Campo Santo; but\r\nthey are additional proofs of his intense and Dante-like genius. No doubt\r\nDante influenced him deeply, as he did all his contemporaries, whose minds\r\nwere fertile enough to ripen such seed. The large picture on the left--a\r\nview of paradise--is full of energetic and beautiful figures, combined with\r\nmuch dramatic effect and great technical skill. The opposite pictures,\r\nrepresenting hell, were not by Andrew, but by Bernard Orgagna, a man of far\r\ninferior calibre. They have, moreover, been entirely revamped.\r\n\r\nIn the choir are the renowned frescos of Dominic Ghirlandaio,--scenes from\r\nthe lives of John the Baptist and the Virgin Mary. These, however, are\r\nbut names and frames. The great merit of these paintings is that they were\r\nthe first, or among the first, to introduce the actual into the world\r\nof conventional and conventual art. They form a series of full-length\r\nportraits,--sometimes of celebrated contemporaries, as Politian, Marsilio\r\nFicino, and others,--but always of flesh-and-blood people, living, moving,\r\nand having a being. That group of Platonists, with their looks of profound\r\nwisdom and dogmatic eloquence, are lifting their forefingers, pricking up\r\ntheir ears, opening their mouths, (each obviously interrupting the flow of\r\nthe others' rhetoric,) in most lifelike fashion. One almost catches the\r\nwinged syllogisms as they fly from lip to lip. We are almost drawn into\r\nthe dispute ourselves, and are disposed to ventilate a score of outrageous\r\nparadoxes, for the mere satisfaction of contradicting such wiseacres. These\r\nheads are painted with a vivacity and an energy worthy of the Dutch great\r\nmasters of the seventeenth century. In fact, there is something caught, no\r\ndoubt, from the early schools of Flanders; for Dominic was the contemporary\r\nof the glorious masters protected by Philip the Good of Burgundy,--the only\r\ngood thing he ever did in his life,--the man who opened the road for that\r\nlong triumphant procession which for two centuries was to march through the\r\nNetherlands, Germany, and Italy. There is no want, however, of historical\r\ndignity in these compositions. Each one has a stately rhythm, an harmonious\r\ngrandeur of conception and execution, which, in connection with the\r\nlifelike fidelity and unaffected beauty of the heads, stamp their creator\r\nas a dramatic genius of a higher order than any of his contemporaries.\r\n\r\nThe Madonna of Cimabue, which hangs at the end of the south transept,\r\nresembles the one in the Academy. In place of the powerful saints' heads,\r\nis a group of angels of much grace and purity, supporting a shrine. This\r\npicture is considered a bolder and more untrammelled composition than the\r\nother. It is the world-renowned masterpiece of the thirteenth century,\r\nwhich all Florence turned out in procession to honor when it left the\r\npainter's hands; and which even Charles of Anjou, dripping in blood, and\r\nstalking through the scenes of that great tragedy whose catastrophe was the\r\nSicilian vespers, paused on his way to admire.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nSAN SPIRITO.\r\n\r\nIn this church, which the admirers of Brunelleschi must study, are two\r\nsmall, but most exquisite masterpieces of Lippo Lippi. All the works of\r\nthis most profligate of friars are tender and holy beyond description.\r\nThey have also that distinguishing charm of the Florentine school of the\r\nfifteenth century, _naïveté_,--a fresh, gentle, and loving appreciation\r\nof the beautiful and the natural. It is evident that the Fra went through\r\nthe world with his eyes open, looking for beauty wherever it was visible;\r\nand in his works, at least, there is no lingering trace of Byzantinism. A\r\nscholar of Masaccio, of a far inferior mind both to Masaccio and Maselino,\r\nand without the force of hand of either, he is still, more than both\r\ntogether, the founder of the natural school of Florence.\r\n\r\nOne of his pictures is in this church,--a Madonna with the child on her\r\nlap. The Christ is leaning forward and playing with a cross which the\r\ninfant Saint John holds in his hand. Nothing can be more suggestive or\r\ntouching than this prophetic infantile movement. Although the color of\r\nthe picture is rather feeble and washy, as frequently may be observed of\r\nLippo's paintings, the whole expression is bathed in purity and piety. Yet\r\nthe Fra was such an incorrigible _mauvais sujet_, that when he was employed\r\nto decorate the _palazzo_ of Cosmo Vecchio, the _Pater Patriæ_ was obliged\r\nto lock up his artist in the chamber which he was painting. The holy man\r\nwas not easily impounded, however; for he cut his bedclothes into strips,\r\nlet himself into the street from an upper-story window, and departed on\r\nhis usual adventures; so that it was weeks before Cosmo could hear of his\r\npainter again.\r\n\r\n[Concluded in the next Number.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSANTA FILOMENA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whene'er a noble deed is wrought,\r\n  Whene'er is spoken a noble thought,\r\n    Our hearts, in glad surprise,\r\n    To higher levels rise.\r\n\r\n  The tidal wave of deeper souls\r\n  Into our inmost being rolls,\r\n    And lifts us unawares\r\n    Out of all meaner cares.\r\n\r\n  Honor to those whose words or deeds\r\n  Thus help us in our daily needs,\r\n    And by their overflow\r\n    Raise us from what is low!\r\n\r\n  Thus thought I, as by night I read\r\n  Of the great army of the dead,\r\n    The trenches cold and damp,\r\n    The starved and frozen camp,--\r\n\r\n  The wounded from the battle-plain,\r\n  In dreary hospitals of pain,\r\n    The cheerless corridors,\r\n    The cold and stony floors.\r\n\r\n  Lo! in that house of misery\r\n  A lady with a lamp I see\r\n    Pass through the glimmering gloom\r\n    And flit from room to room.\r\n\r\n  And slow, as in a dream of bliss,\r\n  The speechless sufferer turns to kiss\r\n    Her shadow, as it falls\r\n    Upon the darkening walls.\r\n\r\n  As if a door in heaven should be\r\n  Opened, and then closed suddenly,\r\n    The vision came and went,\r\n    The light shone and was spent.\r\n\r\n  On England's annals, through the long\r\n  Hereafter of her speech and song,\r\n    That light its rays shall cast\r\n    From portals of the past.\r\n\r\n  A lady with a lamp shall stand\r\n  In the great history of the land,\r\n    A noble type of good,\r\n    Heroic womanhood.\r\n\r\n  Nor even shall be wanting here\r\n  The palm, the lily, and the spear,\r\n    The symbols that of yore\r\n    Saint Filomena bore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSALLY PARSONS'S DUTY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun that shines on eastern Massachusetts, specially on buttercups and\r\ndandelions, and providentially on potatoes, looks down on no greener fields\r\nin these days than it saw in the spring of 1775, fenced in and fenced off\r\nby the zigzag snake-fences of 'Zekiel Parsons's farm.\r\n\r\n\"About this time,\" as almanacs say, young orchards were misty with buds,\r\nred maples on the highway shone in the clear light, and a row of bright\r\ntin pans at the shed door of the farm-house testified to a sturdy arm and\r\nskilful hand within,--arm and hand both belonging to no less a person than\r\nMiss Sally, 'Zekiel Parsons's only daughter, and the prettiest girl in\r\nWestbury; a short, sturdy, rosy little maid, with hair like a ripe chestnut\r\nshell, bright blue eyes full of mischief, and such a sunny, healthy,\r\ncommon-sense character, one is almost afraid to tell of it, it is so out of\r\ndate now.\r\n\r\nBut of what use is it to describe her? How can I impress upon moderns how\r\nenlivening and refreshing was her aspect, as she spun, or scoured pans, in\r\na linsey-woolsey petticoat and white short gown, wearing her pretty curls\r\nin a crop? George Tucker knew it all without telling; and so did half a\r\ndozen of the Westbury boys, who haunted the picket fence round 'Zekiel's\r\ngarden every moonlight night in summer, or scraped their feet by the half\r\nhour together on his door-step in winter evenings. Sally was a belle; she\r\nknew it and liked it, as every honest girl does;--and she would have been\r\na belle without the aid of her father's wide farm and pine-tree shillings;\r\nfor she was fresh and lovely, with a spice of coquetry, but a true woman's\r\nheart beneath it all.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard to discover whom Sally Parsons favored among her numerous\r\nbeaux. Her father seriously inclined to George Tucker; not because he was\r\nrich,--for 'Zekiel had not arrived at fashionable principles,--but because\r\nhe was honest, kind-hearted, and reliable; but as yet Sally showed no\r\ndecided preference; time and the hour were near, but not in sight.\r\n\r\nOne Sunday night, early in April, after the nine o'clock bell had scattered\r\nSally's admirers far and wide, and old 'Zekiel sat by the chimney corner,\r\nwatching his sister, Aunt Poll, rake up the rest of the hickory log in the\r\nashes, while he rubbed away sturdily at his feet, holding in one hand the\r\nblue yarn stockings, \"wrought by no hand, as you may guess,\" but that of\r\nSally; the talk, that had momentarily died away, began again, and with a\r\nglance at Long Snapps,--a lank, shrewd-faced old sailor, who, to use his\r\nown speech, had \"cast anchor 'longside of an old ship-met fur a spell,\r\nbein' bound fur his own cabin up in Lenox,\"--'Zekiel spoke after this\r\nwise:--\r\n\r\n\"I expect, Long, you sailors hev a drefful hard, onsartain time navigatin',\r\ndon't ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, skipper! that are depen's on folks. I don't calk'late to hev no sort\r\nof a hard time, ef I don't get riled with it; but these times I doo rile\r\neasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"What onsettles ye, Snapps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's a squall to wind'ard, skipper; 'ta'n't no cat's-paw neither;\r\ngood no-no-east, ef it's a flaw. And you landlubbers are a-goin' to\r\nleeward, some on ye.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't say! what be you a hintin' at?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, there's a reel blow down to Bostin, Zekle; there's no more gettin'\r\nout o' harbour with our old sloop; she's ben an' gone, an' got some 'tarnal\r\nlawyer's job spliced to her bows, an' she's laid up to dry; but that's\r\na pesky small part o' judgment. Bostin's full o' them Britishers, sech\r\nas scomfishkated the Susan Jane, cos our skipper done suthin' he hedn't\r\noughter, or didn't do suthin' he hed oughter; and I tell _yew_ the end o'\r\nthings is nigh about comin' on here!\"\r\n\r\nSally, in the chimney corner, heard Long Snapps with open eyes, and\r\nhitching her wooden chair nearer, inquired solemnly,--\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Mister Snapps? Is the end of the world comin' here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless your pooty little figger-head, Sally! I don't know as 'tis, but\r\nsuthin' nigh about as bad is a-comin. Them Britishers is sot out for to hev\r\nus under hatches, or else walk the plank; and they're darned mistook, ef\r\nthey think men is a-goin' to be steered blind, and can't blow up the cap'en\r\nno rate. There a'n't no man in Ameriky but what's got suthin' to fight for,\r\nafore he'll gin in to sech tyrints; and it'll come to fightin', yet, afore\r\nlong!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh my! oh goody! the land's sakes! yew don't mean ter say that, Long?\"\r\nwofully screeched Aunt Poll, whose ideas of war were derived in great\r\nmeasure from the tattered copy of Josephus extant in the Parsons family;\r\nand who was at present calculating the probable effect of a battering-ram\r\non their back buttery, and thinking how horrid it would be to eat up Uncle\r\n'Zekiel in case of famine,--even after long courses of rats and dogs.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I dew, Aunt Poll; there'll be some poppin' an' stickin' done in\r\nthese parts, afore long!\"\r\n\r\n\"The Lord deliver us! an' the rest on't!\" devoutly ejaculated Poll, whose\r\npiety exceeded her memory; whereat 'Zekiel, pulling on the other blue\r\nstocking that had hung suspended in his fingers, while the sailor\r\ndiscoursed, exhorted a little himself.\r\n\r\n\"Well, the Lord don't deliver nobody, without they wriggle for themselves\r\npretty consider'ble well fust. This a'n't the newest news to me; I've been\r\nexpectin' on't a long spell, an' I've talked consider'ble with Westbury\r\nfolks about it; and there a'n't nobody much, round about here, but what'll\r\nstand out agin the Britishers, exceptin' Tucker's folks; they're desp'rit\r\nfor Church an' King; they tell as ef the Lord gin the king a special\r\nlicense to set up in a big chair an' rewl creation; an' they think it's\r\nperticular sin to speak as though he could go 'skew anyhow. Now I believe\r\nthe Lord lets folks find out what He does, out o' Scriptur; and I han't\r\nfound nothin' yet to tell about kings bein' better than their neighbours,\r\nand it don't look as ef this king was so clever as common. I s'pose you\r\nha'n't heerd what our Colony Congress is a-doin', hev ye, Snapps?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, I ha'n't. They was a-layin' to, last I heerd, so's to settle\r\ntheir course, I 'xpect they've heaved up an' let go by this, but I han't\r\nseen no signals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me!\" interrupted Sally, \"a real war coming! and I a'n't any thing but\r\na woman!\"\r\n\r\nHer cheeks and eyes glowed with fervent feeling, as she said this; and the\r\nold sailor, turning round, surveyed her with a grin of honest admiration.\r\n\r\n\"Well said, gal! but you're out o' your reckonin', ef you think women a'n't\r\nnothin' in war-time. I tell _yew_, them is the craft that sails afore the\r\nwind, and does the signallin' to all the fleet. When gals is full-rigged\r\nan' tonguey, they're reg'lar press-gangs to twist young fellers round, an'\r\nmake 'em sail under the right colors. Stick to the ship, Miss Sally; give\r\na heave at the windlass now'n then, an' don't let nary one o' them fellers\r\nthat comes a buzzin' round you the hull time turn his back on Yankee\r\nDoodle; an' you won't never hanker to be a man, ef 'tis war-time!\"\r\n\r\nSally's eyes burned bluer than before. \"Thank you kindly, Mister Snapps.\r\nI'm obleeged to you for putting the good thought into my head. (If I don't\r\npester George Tucker! the plaguy Tory!)\"\r\n\r\nThis parenthesis was mental, and Sally went off to bed with a busy brain;\r\nbut the sleep of youth and health quieted it; and if she dreamed of\r\nGeorge Tucker in regimentals, I am afraid they were of flagrant militia\r\nscarlet;--the buff and blue were not distinctive yet. However, for the next\r\nweek Sally heard enough revolutionary doctrine to revive her Sunday-night\r\nenthusiasm; the flame of \"successful rebellion\" had spread; the country\r\nbegan to stir and hum ominously; people assembled in groups, on corners,\r\nby church steps, around tavern-doors, with faces full of portent and\r\nexpectance; ploughs stood idly in the fields; and the raw-boned horses,\r\nthat should of right have dragged the reluctant share through heavy clay\r\nand abounding stones, now, bestridden by breathless couriers, scoured the\r\ncountry hither and yon, with news, messages, and orders from those who had\r\ntaken the right to order out of the hands of sleek and positive officials.\r\n\r\nNor were Westbury people the last to wake up in the general _réveille_.\r\nEverybody in the pretty, tranquil village, tranquil now no more, declared\r\nthemselves openly on one side or the other;--Peter Tucker and his son\r\nGeorge for the king, of course; and this open avowal caused a sufficiently\r\npungent scene in Miss Sally Parsons's keeping-room the very next Sunday\r\nnight, when the aforesaid George, in company with several of his peers,\r\nvisited the farm-house for the laudable purpose of \"sparkin'\" Miss Sally.\r\n\r\nThere were three other youths there, besides George; all stout for the\r\nContinental side of the question, and full of eager but restrained zeal;\r\nready to take up arms at a moment's notice; equally ready to wait for the\r\nripened time. Of such men were those armies made up that endured with a\r\nwoman's patience and fought with a man's fury, righting a great wrong as\r\nmuch by moral as by physical strength, and going to death for the right,\r\nwhen death, pitiless and inevitable, stared them in the face.\r\n\r\nLong Snapps had been, in his own phrase, \"weather-bound\" at Westbury, and\r\nwas there still, safe in the chimney-corner, his shrewd face puckered\r\nwith thought and care, his steady old heart full of resolute bravery, and\r\nlonging for the time to come; flint and steel ready to strike fire on the\r\nslightest collision. On the other side of the hearth from Snapps sat Zekle\r\nin his butternut-colored Sunday suit; the four young men ranged in a grim\r\nrow of high-backed wooden chairs; Sally, blooming as the roses on her\r\nchintz gown, occupying one end of the settle, while Aunt Poll filled the\r\nrest of that institution with her ample quilted petticoat and paduasoy\r\ncloak, trying hard to keep her hands still, in their unaccustomed\r\nidleness,--nay, if it must be told, surreptitiously keeping up a knitting\r\nwith the fingers, in lieu of the accustomed needles and yarn.\r\n\r\nAn awful silence reigned after the preliminary bows and scrapes had been\r\nachieved,--first broken by George Tucker, who drew from under his chair a\r\nsmall basket of red-cheeked apples and handed them to Aunt Poll.\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, George Tucker!\" exclaimed the benign spinster, \"you dew beat\r\nall for sass out o' season! Kep 'em down sullar, I expect?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes'm, our sullar's very dry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, it hed oughter. What kind be they?\"\r\n\r\n\"English pippins, ma'am.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dew tell! be you a-goin to hev one, Sally?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Aunt Poll! I don't want any thin' English 'round!\"\r\n\r\nThe three young men grinned and chuckled. George Tucker turned red.\r\n\r\n\"Hooray for you, Sally!\" sung out old Snapps. \"You're a three-decker, ef\r\never there was 'un!\"\r\n\r\nAgain George reddened, fidgeted on his chair, and at last said, in a\r\ndisturbed, but quite distinct voice,--\r\n\r\n\"I think the apples are good, Miss Sally, if the name don't suit you.\"\r\n\r\n\"The name's too bad to be good, sir!\" retorted Sally, with a decided sniff\r\nand toss of the head. Old Zekle gave a low laugh and interfered.\r\n\r\n\"You see, George Tucker, these here times is curus! It wakes up the wimmen\r\nfolks to hev no tea, nor no prospects of peace an' quiet, so's to make\r\nbutter an' set hens.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, father!\" burst out Sally, \"do you think that's all that ails women? I\r\nwouldn't care if I eat samp forever, and had nothing but saxifrax tea; but\r\nI can't stand by cool, and see men driven like dumb beasts by another man,\r\nif he has got a crown, and never be let speak for themselves!\"\r\n\r\nSally's logic was rather confused, but George got at the idea as fast as\r\nwas necessary.\r\n\r\n\"If 'twas a common man, Miss Sally; but a king's set up on high by the\r\nLord, and we ought to obey what He sets over us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see where in Scriptur you get that idee, George,\" retorted Zekle.\r\n\r\n\"Well, it says in one place you're to obey them that has the rule over you,\r\nsir.\"\r\n\r\n\"So it do; but ef the king ha'n't got no rewl over us, (an' it looks mighty\r\nlike it jes' now,) why, I don't see's we're bound to mind him!\"\r\n\r\nThis astute little sophism confounded poor George for a minute, during\r\nwhich Sally began to giggle violently, and flirt in her rustic fashion\r\nwith the three rebels in a row. At length George, recovering his poise and\r\nclear-sightedness, resumed,--\r\n\r\n\"But he did rule over us, Mister Parsons, and I can't see how it's right to\r\nrebel.\"\r\n\r\n\"There don't everythin' come jest square about seein' things,\" interposed\r\nLong Snapps; \"folks hed better steer by facts sometimes, than by yarns.\r\nIt's jest like v'yagin'; yew do'no' sumtimes what's to pay with a compass;\r\nit'll go all p'ints to once; mebbe somebody's got a hatchet near by, or\r\nsome lubber's throwed a chain down by the binnacle, or some darned thing's\r\ngot inside on't, or it's shipped a sea an' got rusted; but there's allers\r\nthe Dipper an' the North Star; they're allers true to their bearin's,\r\nand you can't go to Davy Jones's locker for want of a light'us so long's\r\nthey're ahead. I calk'late its jes' so about this king-talk; orders is very\r\nwell when they a'n't agin common sense an' the rights o' natur; but you\r\nsee, George Tucker, folks will go 'cordin to natur an' reason, ef there's\r\nforty parlamints an' kings in tow. Natur's jest like a no'west squall; you\r\ncan't do nothin' but tack ag'inst it; and no men is goin' to stan' still\r\nand see the wind taken out o' their sails, an' their liberty flung to\r\nsharks, without one mutiny to know why!\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" burst out Sally, who had stopped flirting, and been listening with\r\nsoul and body to Long; \"and no man, that _is_ a man, will go against the\r\nright and the truth just because the wrong is strongest!\"\r\n\r\nThis little feminine insult was too much for George Tucker, particularly as\r\nhe had not the least idea how its utterance burned Sally's lips, and made\r\nher heart ache. He got up from his chair with a very bitter look on his\r\nhandsome face.\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said he, quite coldly, \"I am likely to be scarce welcome here. I\r\nbelieve the king is my master, made so by the Lord, and I think it is my\r\nhonest duty to obey him. It hurts me to part otherwise than kind with\r\nfriends; but I wish you a good night, and better judgment.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something so manly in George's speech, that, but for its final\r\nfling and personality, every man in the room would have crowded round him\r\nto shake hands; but what man ever coolly heard his judgment impeached?\r\n\r\nSally swallowed a great round sob; but being, like all women, an actress in\r\nher way, bowed as calmly to Mr. George as if he only said adieu, after an\r\nordinary call.\r\n\r\nAunt Poll snuffled, and followed George to the door; Uncle Zekle drew\r\nhimself up straight, and looked after him, his clear blue eyes sparkling\r\nwith two rays,--one of honest patriotic wrath, one of affection and regret\r\nfor George; while Long, from the corner, eyed all with a serpent's wisdom\r\nin his gaze, oracularly uttering, as the door shut,--\r\n\r\n\"Well, that 'are feller is good grit!\"\r\n\r\n\"All the worse for us!\" growled Eliashib Sparks, the biggest of the three,\r\nsurprising Sally into a little hysterical laugh, and surprised himself\r\nstill more at this unexpected sequence to his remark.\r\n\r\n\"Pooty bad! George is a clever fellow!\" ejaculated Zekle. \"He han't got the\r\nrights on't, but I think he'll come round by'n by.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do'no',\" said Long, meditatively; \"he's pooty stiff, that 'are feller.\r\nHe's sot on dooty, I see; an' that means suthin', when a man that oughter\r\nbe called a man sez it. Wimmin-folks, now, don't sail on that tack. When\r\na gal sets to talkin' about her dooty, it's allers suthin' she wants ter\r\ndo and han't got no grand excuse for't. Ye never see a woman't didn't get\r\nmarried for dooty yet; there a'n't nary one on 'em darst to say they wanted\r\nter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! Mister Long!\" exclaimed Sally.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sally, it's nigh about so; you han't lived a hunderd year. Some o'\r\nthese days you'll get to know yer dooty.\"\r\n\r\nSally turned red, and the three young men sniggered. Forgive the word,\r\ngentle and fair readers! it means what I mean, and no other word expresses\r\nit; let us be graphic and die!\r\n\r\nJust then the meeting-house bell rang for nine o'clock; and every man got\r\nup from his seat, like a son of Anak, bowed, scraped, cleared his throat to\r\nsay \"Goodnight,\" did say something like it, and left.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sally, I swear you're good at signallin',\" broke out Long, as soon\r\nas the youths were fairly out of sight and sound; \"you hev done it for\r\nGeorge Tucker!\"\r\n\r\nSally gave no answer, but a brand from the back-log fell, blazed up in a\r\nshaft of rosy flame, and showed a suspicious glitter on the girl's round,\r\nwholesome cheek. Aunt Poll had gone to bed; Zekle was going the nightly\r\nrounds of his barns, to see to the stock; Long Snapps was aware of\r\nopportunity, the secret of success.\r\n\r\n\"Sally,\" said he, \"is that feller sparkin' you?\"\r\n\r\nSally laughed a little, and something, perhaps the blaze, reddened her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know,\" said the pretty hypocrite, demurely.\r\n\r\n\"H'm! well, I do,\" answered Long; \"and you a'n't never goin' to take up\r\nwith a Tory? don't think it's yer dooty, hey?\"\r\n\r\n\"No indeed!\" flashed Sally. \"Do you think I'd marry a Britisher? I'd run\r\naway and live with the Indians first.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pooty good! pooty good! you're calk'lating to make George into a rebel, I\r\n'xpect?\"\r\n\r\nLong was looking into the fire when he said this; he did not see Sally's\r\nlook of rage and amazement at his unpleasant penetration.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure I don't care what George Tucker thinks,\" said she, with a toss of\r\nher curly head.\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" uttered Long, meditatively, \"lucky! I 'xpect he carries too many\r\nguns to be steered by a woman; 'tis a kinder pity you a'n't a man, Sally;\r\nmebbe you'd argufy him round then; it's plain as the Gulf you can't crook\r\nhis v'yage; he's too stiff for wimmin-folks, that is a fact!\"\r\n\r\nOh, Long Snapps! Long Snapps! how many wives, in how many ports, went to\r\nthe knowledge of feminine nature that dictated that speech? Sally set her\r\nlips. From that hour George Tucker was a doomed man; but she said nothing\r\nmore audible than \"Goodnight.\" Long looked at her, as she lit the tallow\r\ndip by the fire, and chuckled when he heard her shut the milk-room door in\r\nthe safe distance. He was satisfied.\r\n\r\nThe next afternoon, Sally was weeding onions in the garden;--heroines did,\r\nin those days;--the currant-bushes had but just leafed out; so George\r\nTucker, going by, saw her; and she, who had seen him coming before she\r\nbegan to weed, accidentally of course, looked up and gave him a very bright\r\nsmile. That was the first spider-thread, and the fly stepped into it with\r\nsuch a thrill!\r\n\r\nOf course he stopped, and said,--\r\n\r\n\"What a pleasant day!\"--the saving phrase of life. Then Sally said\r\nsomething he couldn't hear, and he leaped the low fence without being\r\nasked, rather than request her to raise her voice; he was so considerate!\r\nNext he remembered, just as he turned to go away, that there were some\r\nwhite violets down in the meadow, that Sally always liked. Couldn't she\r\nspend time to walk down there across lots and get some? Sally thought the\r\nonions could not be left. Truth to tell, her heart was in her mouth. She\r\nhad been playing with edge-tools; but just then she smelt a whiff of smoke\r\nfrom Long Snapps's pipe, and the resolve of last night came back; her face\r\nrelented, and George, seeing it, used his utmost persuasiveness; so the\r\nresult was, that Sally washed her hands at the well, and away they went, in\r\nthe most serene silence, over fences, grass-lots, and ditches, through bits\r\nof woodland, and fields of winter-green, till they reached the edge of the\r\ngreat meadow, and sat down on a log to rest. It was rather a good place for\r\nthat purpose. An old pine had fallen at the feet of a majestic cluster of\r\nits brethren, so close that the broad column of one made a natural back to\r\npart of the seat. The ground was warm, dry sand, strown with the fine dead\r\nleaves of past seasons, brown and aromatic. A light south wind woke the\r\nvoices of every bough above, and the melancholy susurrus rose and fell\r\nin delicate cadences; while beyond the green meadow, Westbury River, a\r\ngood-sized brook, babbled and danced as if there were no pine-tree laments\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\nI believe the air, and the odor, and the crying wind drove the violets\r\nquite out of both the two heads that drooped silently over that pine\r\nlog. If Sally had been nervous or poetical, she would have been glad to\r\nrecollect them; but no such morbidness invaded her healthy soul. She sat\r\nquite still till George said, in a suppressed and rather broken tone,--\r\n\r\n\"I was sorry to vex you last night, Sally! I could not be sorry for any\r\nthing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did grieve me very much, Mister George,\" said Sally, affecting a\r\nlittle distance in her address, but sufficiently tender in manner.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I suppose you don't see it the way I do,\" returned George; \"and I am\r\nvery sorry, for I had rather please you than any body else.\"\r\n\r\nThis was especially tender, and he possessed himself of Sally's little red\r\nhand, unaware or careless that it smelt of onions; but it was withdrawn\r\nvery decidedly.\r\n\r\n\"I think you take a strange way of showing your liking!\" sniffed the\r\ndamsel.\r\n\r\nGeorge sat astounded. Another tiny spider-thread stopped the fly; a subtle\r\nray of blue sped sideways out of Sally's eye, that meant,--\"I don't object\r\nto be liked.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish with all my heart I knew any good way to please you,\" he fervently\r\nejaculated.\r\n\r\n\"_I_ should think any way to please people was a good way,\" retorted Sally,\r\nsaying more with her eyes than with her voice,--so much more, that in fact\r\nthis fly was fast. A little puff of wind blew off Sally's bonnet; she\r\nlooked shy, flushed, lovely. George stood up on his feet, and took his hat\r\noff.\r\n\r\n\"Sally!\" said he, in the deepest notes of his full, manly voice, \"I love\r\nyou very much indeed; will you be my wife?\"\r\n\r\nSally was confounded. I rejoice to say she was quite confounded; but she\r\nwas made of revolutionary stuff, and what just now interfered with her\r\nplans and schemes was the sudden discovery how very much indeed she loved\r\nGeorge Tucker; a fact she had not left enough margin for in her plot.\r\n\r\nBut, as I said, she was made of good metal, and she answered very low,--\r\n\r\n\"I do like you, George; but I never will marry a Britisher and a Tory.\"\r\n\r\nA spasm of real anguish distorted the handsome face, bent forward to\r\nlisten.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that, Sally? Can't you love me because we don't think alike?\"\r\n\r\nSally choked a little; her tones fell to a whisper. George had to sit down\r\nclose to her to hear.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't say I didn't love you, George!\"--A blissful pause of a second;\r\nthen in a clear, cold voice,--\"But my mind's set. I can't marry a Britisher\r\nand a Tory, if I died sayin' so.\"\r\n\r\nGeorge gasped.\r\n\r\n\"And I cannot turn traitor and rebel, Sally. I can _not_. I love you better\r\nthan any thing in the world; but I can't do a wicked thing; no, not even\r\nfor you.\"\r\n\r\nHe was pale as death. Sally's secret heart felt proud of him, and never had\r\nshe been so near repenting of her work in the good cause before; but she\r\nwas resolute.\r\n\r\n\"Very well!\" replied she, coolly, \"if you prefer the king to me, it's not\r\nmy fault; when your side beats, you can take your revenge!\"\r\n\r\nThe thorough injustice of this speech roused her lover's generous\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\n\"If you can think that way of me, Sally, it is better for us both to have\r\nme go! Good night!\" And away strode the loyal fellow, never looking back\r\nto see his sweetheart have a good cry on the pine-log, and then an equally\r\ncomfortable fit of laughter; for she knew very well how restless Mister\r\nGeorge would be, all alone by himself, and how much it meant that they both\r\nloved each other, and both knew it.\r\n\r\nSally's heart was stout. A sort of Yankee Evangeline, she would not have\r\ngone after Gabriel; she would have staid at home and waited for him to the\r\nend of time; doing chores and mending meanwhile, but unmarried, in the\r\nfixed intention of being her lover's sixth wife possibly, but his wife at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nSo she went home and got supper, strained and skimmed milk, set a sponge\r\nfor bread, and slept all night like a dormouse. George Tucker never went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\"Hooraw!\" roared Long Snapps, trundling in to dinner, the next day;\r\n\"they're wakin' up down to Bostin! Good many on 'em's quit the town.\r\nThem 'are Britishers is a-gettin' up sech a breeze; an' they doo say the\r\nreg'lars is comin' out full sail, to cair' off all the amminition in these\r\nparts, fear o' mutiny 'mongst the milishy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Come along!\" shouted Zekle, \"let 'em come! like to see 'em takin' our\r\npowder an' shot 'thout askin'! Guess they'll hear thunder, ef they stick\r\ntheir heads inter a hornet's nest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dredful suz!\" exclaimed Aunt Poll, pulling turnips out of the pot with\r\nreckless haste, and so scalding her brown fingers emphatically; \"be they\r\na-comin' here? will they fetch along the batterin' rams?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thunder _an'_ dry trees,\" ejaculated Zekle, \"what does the woman--\";\r\nbut at that instant Long made for the door, and flung it open, thereby\r\npreventing explanations.\r\n\r\n\"Goin' to Concord, George?\" shouted he to George Tucker, who in a one-horse\r\nwagon and his Sunday-best clothes was driving slowly past.\r\n\r\n\"No! goin' to Lexington, after corn. Can I do anything for you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, no, I 'xpect not. When be you a-comin' back?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, go long! good-luck to ye; keep to wind'ard o' squalls, George.\"\r\n\r\nLong nodded, and George drove on. That day the whole village of Westbury\r\nwas in an uproar. News had come from Boston that the British were about\r\nto send out forces to possess themselves of all the military stores in\r\nthe country, and forestall rebellion by rendering it helpless. From every\r\ncorner of every farm and village, young men and old mustered; from every\r\nbarn, horses of all sizes and descriptions were driven out and saddled;\r\nrusty muskets, balls of all shapes and of any available metal that would\r\nmelt and run, disabled broadswords, horse-pistols, blunderbusses, whatever\r\nwore any resemblance to a weapon, or could be rendered serviceable to that\r\nend,--all were hunted out, cleaned, mended, and laid ready;--an array that\r\nmight have made a properly drilled and equipped army smile in contempt,\r\nbut whose deficiencies were more than supplied by iron sinews, true blood,\r\nresolve and desperate courage.\r\n\r\nSally and Aunt Poll partook the gale of patriotism. They scoured the \"ole\r\nqueen's arm\" to brilliancy; they ran bullets by the hour; baked bread and\r\nbrewed Spring beer, with no more definite purpose than a general conviction\r\nthat men must and would eat, as the men of their house certainly did, in\r\nthe intervals of repairing harness, filling powder-horns and shot-belts,\r\ntrotting over to the tavern after news, and coming back to retail it,\r\ntill Aunt Poll began to imagine she heard the distant strokes of a\r\nbattering-ram, and rushing out in terror to assure herself, discovered it\r\nto be only Sam Pequot, an old Indian, who, with the apathy of his race, was\r\nthreshing in the barn.\r\n\r\nAunt Poll took down Josephus to refresh her memory, and actually drew a\r\nlaugh from Sally's grave lips by confiding to her this extreme horror of\r\nthe case; a laugh she forgave, since Sally reassured her by recommending to\r\nher notice the fact that Jerusalem had stone walls that were more difficult\r\nto climb than stone fences. As for Sally, she thought of George, all day of\r\nGeorge, all night; and while the next day deepened toward noon, was still\r\nthinking of him, when in rushed Long Snapps, tarpaulin in hand, full of\r\nnews and horror.\r\n\r\n\"I swan! we've got it now!\" said he. \"Them darned Britishers sot out fur\r\nConcord last night, to board our decks an' plunder the magazine; the\r\nboys heerd on't, and they was ready over to Lexin'ton, waitin' round the\r\nmeetin'us; they stood to't, an' that old powder monkey Pitcairn sung out to\r\nthrow down their arms, darned rebels; an' cause they didn't muster to his\r\nwhistle, he let fly at 'em like split; an' there's some killed an' more\r\nwounded; pretty much all on 'em our folks, though they did giv the reg'lars\r\none round o' ball afore they run.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hooray!\" shouted Zekle; \"that's the talk; guess they'll sing smaller next\r\ntime!\"\r\n\r\n\"They'll do more'n that, Zekle,\" responded Long; \"this a'n't but the\r\nbeginnin' o' sorrers, as Parson Marsh sez, sez he; there'll be a hull gulf\r\nstream o' blood, afore them darned reg'lars knows the color on't well\r\nenough to lay their course.\"\r\n\r\nSally glided past Long, and plucked him by the sleeve, unseen by the rest.\r\nHe followed her into the shed. She was ghastly pale. \"Long,\" said she,\r\nhurriedly, \"did you hear who? was anybody shot?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless ye, gal! a hull school on 'em was shot; there wasn't many went to\r\nthe bottom, though; han't heerd no names.\"\r\n\r\n\"But George?\" gasped Sally; \"he went to Lexington yesterday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I am took aback!\" growled Long. \"I swear I never thought on't. I'll\r\ngo see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come back and tell me?\" whispered Sally.\r\n\r\n\"Lord-a-massy, yes, child! jest as soon's I know myself trewly! but I\r\nshan't know nothin' more till sundown, I expect. Desire Trowbridge is\r\na-ridin' post; he'll come through 'bout that time with news.\"\r\n\r\nLong did not come back for several hours, some time after sundown, when he\r\nfound Sally in the shed, waiting for him. She saw the news in his face.\r\n\"Dead?\" said she, clutching at the old sailor's hand.\r\n\r\n\"No! no! he a'n't slipt his moorins' yet, but he is badly stove about the\r\nfigger-head; he's got a ball through his head somewhere, an' another in his\r\nleg; and he a'n't within hail; don't hear no speakin'-trumpets; fact is,\r\nSally, he's in for the dockyard a good spell, ef he a'n't broke up hull and\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who shot him?\" whispered Sally.\r\n\r\n\"That's the best on't, gal; he's took an' tacked beautiful; he went into\r\nport at Lexin'ton yesterday, and heerin' there all sides o' the story,\r\nan' how them critters sot up for to thieve away our stores, he got kinder\r\nriled at the hull crew, like a common-sense feller, an' when Pitcairn come\r\nalong, George finally struck his colors, run up a new un to the mast-head,\r\nborrered a musket, an' jined the milishy, an' got shot by them cussed\r\nreg'lars fur his pains; an ef he doos die, I'll hev a figger cut on a stun\r\nmyself, to tell folks he was a rebel and an honest man arter all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he?\" asked Sally in another whisper.\r\n\r\n\"He's to the tavern there in Lexin'ton. There a'n't nobody along with him,\r\ncause his father's gone to Bostin to see 'bout not gettin' scomfishkated,\r\nor arter a protection, or sumthin.\"\r\n\r\n\"And his mother is dead,\" said Sally, slowly. \"Long! I must go to Lexington\r\nto-night, on the pillion, and you must go with me. Father's got too much\r\nrheumatiz to ask it of him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well!\" said Long, after a protracted stare at Sally,--\"wimmin is the\r\noddest craft that ever sailed. I swan, when I sight 'em I don't know a\r\nmain-top-sail from a flyin' jib! Goin' to take care o' George, be ye?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Sally, meekly.\r\n\r\nLong rolled the inseparable quid in his cheek, and slyly drawled out,\r\n\"W-ell, if ye must, ye must! I a'n't a-goin' ter stand in the way of yer\r\ndooty!\"\r\n\r\nSally was too far away to hear, or she might have smiled.\r\n\r\nUncle Zeke and Aunt Poll were to be told and coaxed into assent;--no very\r\nhard task; for George Tucker was a favorite of 'Zekiel's, and now he had\r\nturned rebel, the only grudge he had ever owed him was removed; he was only\r\ntoo glad to help him in any way. Aunt Poll's sole trouble was lest Sally\r\nshould take cold. The proprieties, those gods of modern social worship, as\r\nwell as their progenitors, the improprieties, were unknown to these simple\r\nsouls; they did things because they were right and wrong. They were not\r\nnice according to Swift's definition, nor proper in the mode of the best\r\nsociety, but they were good and pure; are the disciples and lecturers of\r\nthe 'proper' equally so?\r\n\r\nSally's simple preparations were quickly made. By nine o'clock she was safe\r\non the pillion behind Long Snapps, folded in Aunt Poll's red joseph, and\r\nprovided with saddle-bags full of comforts and necessaries. The night was\r\ndark, but Sally did not feel any fear; not Tam O'Shanter's experience could\r\nhave shaken the honest little creature's courage, when George filled the\r\nperspective before her. The way was lonely; the hard road echoed under\r\nthe old cart-horse's hoofs; many a black and desolate tract of forest lay\r\nacross their twenty miles' ride; more than once the tremulous shriek of a\r\nscreech-owl smote ominously on Sally's wakeful sense, and quavered away\r\nlike a dying groan; more than once a mournful whippoorwill cried out in\r\npain and expostulation, and in the young leaves a shivering wind foreboded\r\nevil;--but they rode on. Presently Sally's drooping head rose erect; she\r\nlistened; she laid her hand on the bridle. \"Stop, Long!\" said she. \"I hear\r\nhorses' feet, and shouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look here!\" said Long, after a moment's listening, \"there's breakers\r\nahead, Sally; let's heave to in these 'ere piny bushes side o' the track;\r\nit's pitch dark, mebbe they'll go by.\"\r\n\r\nHe reined the horse from the road, and forced him into a group of young\r\nhemlocks, which hid them entirely from passers by. Just as he was well\r\nensconced, a company of British cavalry rode up, broken and disorderly\r\nenough, cursing and swearing at the Yankees, and telling to unseen ears\r\na bloody story of Concord and its men. Sally trembled, but it was with\r\nindignation, not fear, and as soon as the last hoof-beat died away, she\r\nurged Long forward; they regained the road, and made their way at once to\r\nGeorge in Lexington.\r\n\r\nIs it well to paint, even in failing words, such emotions as Sally fought\r\nwith and conquered in that hour? Whoever has stood by the bed of a\r\nspeechless, hopeless, unconscious human being, in whom their own soul lived\r\nand suffered, will know these pangs without my interpretation. Whoever\r\nknows them not need not so anticipate. If Sally had been less a woman, I\r\nmight have had more to say; but she was only a woman, and loved George, so\r\nshe went on in undisturbed self-control, and untiring exertion, to nurse\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe doctor said he could not live; Long said he was booked for Davy Jones;\r\nthe minister prayed for \"our dying brother\";--but Sally said he should\r\nlive, and he did. After weeks of patient care he knew her; after more weeks\r\nhe spoke,--words few, but precious; and when accumulating months brought\r\nto the battlefields of America redder stains than even patriotic blood had\r\nsplashed upon their leaves,--when one nation began to hope, and another to\r\nfear, both hope and fear had shaken hands with Sally and said good-bye. She\r\nwas married to George Tucker, and, with the prospect of a crippled husband\r\nfor life, was perfectly happy; too happy not to laugh, when, the day after\r\ntheir wedding, sitting on the door-sill of the old Westbury homestead, with\r\nGeorge and Long Snapps, George said, \"Would you ever have come to take care\r\nof me, Sally, if I'd 'a' been shot on the side of the reg'lars?\"\r\n\r\nSally looked at him, and then looked away.\r\n\r\n\"I 'xpect she'd 'a' done her dooty,\" said Long Snapps dryly; and Sally\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MANCHESTER EXHIBITION.\r\n\r\nIn a number of the \"Illustrated News,\" not long since, there was what\r\nprofessed to be a view of Manchester. It represented a thousand tall\r\nfactory-chimneys rising out of a gray mist, and surmounted by a heavy,\r\ndrifting cloud of smoke. And in truth a view not very different from this\r\nwas presented to any one who, standing at the entrance of the Palace of the\r\nExhibition of Art Treasures, turned and looked back before going within.\r\nTwo miles off lies the body of the great workshop-city, already stretching\r\nits begrimed arms in the direction of the Exhibition. The vast flat expanse\r\nof brick walls, diversified by countless chimney and occasional steeples,\r\nnow and then interrupted by the insertion of a low shed or an enormous\r\nwarehouse, offers no single object upon which the eye or the imagination\r\ncan rest with pleasure. Such a view was never to be seen in the world\r\nbefore this century; a city built merely by trade, built for the home of\r\nlabor, of machines, and of engines, and for the dwelling-place (one cannot\r\ncall it the home) of crowds of human beings, whose value is, for the\r\nmost part, estimated according to the development of their machine-like\r\nqualities. Beauty is not consulted here. In those places in or near the\r\ncity, where Nature, reluctant to be driven utterly away, still tries to\r\nkeep a foothold, she is parched and scorched by the feverish breath of\r\nforges and furnaces. Standing here, one may see the cloud of smoke, which\r\nwaves in the wind like a pall over the city, slowly moving and settling\r\ndown upon the land. One may almost hear the roar of the continual fires,\r\nthe throb of the engines, the heavy beat of the trip-hammers, and the\r\nrattle of the spindles, by which the work of the world is done; and their\r\nnoises, blended by the distance into one monotonous sound, seem like the\r\nvoice of the restless, hard-working, unsettled spirit of gain. Manchester\r\nis built and is worked for profit, not for pleasure; beauty is driven away\r\nfrom her as a thing at variance with practical life; and even the sky above\r\nher and the fields around her yield only at rare moments and for short\r\nseasons those precious and gracious shows of beauty which are the free and\r\nblessed gift of love to all the world. Smoke, steam, coal-dust, blackened\r\nwalls, and bare fields lie outside the Exhibition; and now let us go\r\nwithin.\r\n\r\nThe world could show no sharper and more affecting contrast. Outside, all\r\nsuggests the competitions and struggles of trade, the crowded street, the\r\nbustle of the exchange, the cold and dry elements of purely unimaginative\r\nlife. Inside, all suggests the quietness and composure of solitary and\r\ndelightful labor, the silence of the studio, the resort to nature, and the\r\nfrequenting of the springs of poetry. From the present, one is suddenly\r\ntransferred to the past; from the near, to the remote. In place of the\r\nblank, black factory wall, there is the low wall of some Italian Campo\r\nSanto, its painted sides more precious than marbles or gold could have made\r\nthem; in place of the dull and heavy stone of the Exchange, the glowing\r\nmosaics of some southern cathedral; in place of the factory bell and\r\nthe rush into the steaming and dirty workroom, the bell of a convent on\r\nFiesole, and the slow walk through its cool cloisters; in place of the dead\r\nfiles of uniform ugly houses, Venetian palaces, with the water at their\r\nbase, reflecting the colors which Giorgione and Titian, housepainters at\r\nVenice, left upon their stones; in place of the racket of the street, the\r\nquiet greenness of an English lane, or the inaccessible ice and glory of\r\na far-off mountain summit; in place of the burnt waste of fields covered\r\nwith ashes and coal-dust, the burning stretch of the desert with the Sphinx\r\nlooking out over it century after century; in place of the shower coming\r\ndown through the dirty air to wash the dirty roofs, a storm breaking over\r\nthe sea-shore rocks, or beating down on the broken wreck; instead of the\r\ndrabbled calico of the factory girl and her face old before its time,\r\nthe satins of Vandyck's beauties, and the fair looks of Sir Peter Lely's\r\nheroines; instead of Manchester mayors and masters of factories, Tintoret's\r\nnoble Venetian counsellors and doges, and Titian's Shakspearian men. It was\r\na bold thought thus to bring pictures and statues into one great collection\r\nat Old Trafford, and to set off the art of the world against the\r\nmanufactures of Manchester.\r\n\r\nThe Exhibition building was admirably designed for its purpose. Its plan\r\nis simple, and not unpleasing, although the proportions, which its object\r\nrequired, were such as to prevent any attempt at grand architectural\r\neffect. The general arrangement of the interior is easily understood, even\r\nwithout the aid of a ground-plan. The chief entrance leads into a nave,\r\nwhich has on each side an aisle of less height, separated from it by a\r\nwall. The wall is broken by two openings, through which is the passage from\r\nnave to aisle, or aisle to nave. The nave and aisles end in a transept,\r\nand behind the transept are two small saloons, and a large hall or aisle\r\ncrossing the building transversely and forming its western end. A gallery\r\nruns round the transept, and another crosses the nave at its eastern end.\r\nThis is the general arrangement. The walls of the nave or central hall are\r\noccupied by the gallery of British portraits, and between the iron columns\r\nthat support the roof are set pieces of sculpture, and the cases containing\r\nthe precious collection of Ornamental Art, (works of the minor arts, as\r\nthey might be called,) which has been brought together from private and\r\npublic sources, and is quite unrivalled in its completeness. The southern\r\naisle contains the main collection of pictures by ancient, foreign masters;\r\nwhile the opposite aisle is filled with the works of the British school.\r\nThe transept, being chiefly given up to arrangements for an orchestra,\r\ncontains below little but a collection of busts, but its galleries are\r\noccupied with the collection of miniatures, a most admirable and extensive\r\nhistorical series of engravings, a large number of photographs, and a very\r\nprecious collection of original drawings by the old masters. The saloon\r\nat the north end of the transept is filled with East Indian and Chinese\r\ntapestries, furniture, and works of ornamental design; while the opposite\r\nsaloon continues the collection of paintings of ancient masters, being\r\nchiefly occupied with works from the gallery of the Marquis of Hertford,\r\nwhich he sent to the Exhibition on condition that they should be kept\r\ntogether. The hall that crosses the building at the western end is filled\r\nwith a collection of water-color drawings.--Such, in brief, is an outline\r\nof the distribution of the treasures contained in this great palace of Art.\r\n\r\nThe first impression, on entering the nave, is that of the vast space\r\nfilled with light and rich with color. The attention is not attracted to\r\nparticular details. Separate objects are dwarfed in the long vista. The eye\r\nrests on nothing that is not precious, and is at first contented to wander\r\nrapidly from one object to another, without attempting to delay on any\r\nthing. Passing down the middle between the ordered files of statues, (all\r\nmodern works, and few of them worthy of remark,) we enter from the transept\r\nthe south nave, where the works of the foreign schools of painting are\r\narranged for the most part in chronological order. This nave, like the\r\nopposite, is divided into three saloons and two vestibules. We are now in\r\nthe first saloon. On the one side are the works of the earlier Italian\r\nmasters, and on the other those of the masters of the earlier German and\r\nFlemish schools. And it is here that one observes the chief deficiency of\r\nthe collection. The pictures which are here have been brought from the\r\nprivate galleries in which England is so rich. Many a famous country-house,\r\nfull of historic and poetic associations, gains additional interest from\r\nits gallery of pictures or of marbles. Blenheim, Wilton House, Warwick\r\nCastle, have their old walls hung with pictures by Titian, Vandyck, and\r\nHolbein. Who does not remember, as one of his most delightful recollections\r\nof England,--delightful as all his recollections of that dear old\r\nMother-land are, if he has really seen her,--who does not thus remember the\r\ndrive from the little country town to the old family place, up the long\r\navenue under its ancestral trees, the ferny brook crossed by the stone\r\nbridge with its carved balustrade, the deer feeding on the green slope\r\nof the open park or lying under some secular oak, the heavy white clouds\r\ncasting their slow shadows on the broad lawn, the dark spreading cedars\r\nof Lebanon standing on the edge of the bright flower-garden,--the old\r\nhouse itself, with its quaint gables and oriels, the broad flight of\r\nsteps leading to the wide door,--the cheerful reception from the prim,\r\nbut good-natured housekeeper,--her pride in the great hall, and in the\r\npleasant, home-like rooms, in Vandyck's portrait of the beautiful countess,\r\nand in Holbein's of the fifth earl,--the satisfaction with which she would\r\npoint to the pictures and the marbles brought two centuries ago from\r\nItaly, now stopping before this to tell you that \"it is considered a very\r\nimproportionable Virgin by Parmigianino,\" and calling you to observe this\r\nold statue \"of a couching Silenius wrapped in the skin of a Pantheon,\"--and\r\nthen, when the Rubens, and the Claude, and all the other pictures have been\r\nseen, her letting you pass, as a great favor, through the library with its\r\nwell-filled oaken shelves, the gilding worn off the backs of many of its\r\nbooks by the love of successive generations;--who does not remember such\r\nscenes as these, and recall the glorious pictures from Florence, or from\r\nVenice, or from Antwerp, that enrich many an English country home?\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, from such homes that the Manchester collection was, in\r\ngreat measure, brought together; and this being the case, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that it was difficult to form an historic sequence of pictures\r\nby which the course and progress of Art should be properly illustrated,\r\nor that many of the old pictures that hang on the walls of the Exhibition\r\nbear the names of greater masters than they deserve to be honored with. Nor\r\nis it strange that the earlier schools of Art should be but very scantily\r\nrepresented. The earlier painters did not do much work that would answer\r\nfor the decoration of homes; their work was of a public, and, for the most\r\npart, a consecrated nature. The pictures of later centuries are more easily\r\nappreciated by those who have not made a thoughtful study of Art, and they\r\nhave consequently been more loudly praised and more generally sought for.\r\nThe later works have attractive qualities in which the earlier are often\r\ndeficient, and it is not until very recently that the real beauty and\r\nvalue of these first pictures of the revival have been felt with any due\r\nappreciation. The masters of the fourteenth, and of the greater part of\r\nthe fifteenth century, did not, as we have said, paint pictures simply as\r\nobjects of beauty or for mere purposes of adornment, nor were those methods\r\nof painting then in use which have brought pictures into private homes and\r\nwithin private means. And so it happens that the schools of this period are\r\nnot represented at Manchester in any fair proportion to the schools of the\r\nsixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe two most important centuries of Art are not to be studied here. Of\r\nthe six pictures, for instance, that profess to be by Giotto, the great\r\nhead and master of Italian Art, there are but two from which even a faint\r\nimpression of his style can be gained. There is nothing here which would\r\nenable one who had not seen his works in Italy to conceive a true idea\r\nof their character and merits. Giotto stands at the threshold of the\r\nfourteenth century, breaking open the door, so long barred up, that was to\r\nlet men into the glories of the unseen world. The friend of Dante, he, as\r\npainter, stands side by side with the poet. In the midst of the tumults,\r\nthe confusion, and violence of those bloody times, his soul rose above\r\nthe discord of the world, his hand snapped the fetters of authority and\r\ntradition, and revealed by line and color the exalted visions of his\r\nimagination. Painting, with him, took its inspiration from religious faith,\r\nand spent itself in religious service. Whether at Padua, in the little\r\nwithdrawn Arena chapel, or on the bare mountains at Assisi, in the great\r\nchurch of St. Francis, or at Naples, in the king's chapel, his frescos,\r\nthough dimmed by the dust of five hundred years, blackened by the smoke\r\nof incense, abused by restorers, still show a power of imagination, a\r\nspirituality and tenderness of feeling, a simplicity and directness of\r\ntreatment, which give them place among the most sacred and precious works\r\nthat Art has yet produced. That quiet, solitary chapel of the Arena at\r\nPadua is one of the places most worthy of reverence in Italy; for in the\r\npictures from the lives of the Virgin and the Saviour, that are painted\r\nupon its walls, there is the expression of such religious fervor, such\r\nfaith and love, as Art has rarely or never reached in later times.\r\n\r\nNor is there at Manchester any picture by Duccio da Siena, the great, and,\r\none may almost say, the worthy contemporary of Giotto, from which his power\r\nand feeling are to be well estimated. Like Giotto he struggled to free\r\nhimself from the swathing-clothes in which the traditions of Byzantine Art\r\nhad bound up the limbs and the imaginations of artists, and he succeeded\r\nin at last breaking loose. But the long restraint had impaired the power\r\nof all who were subjected to it; and as in the works of Giotto, so in the\r\nrarer works of Duccio, one often finds an effort after truth of expression,\r\nwhich is almost pathetic in its character, from its revealing the\r\ninefficiency of the hand to carry out the thought, and the resolute will\r\nstriving half in vain to overcome the impediments of bad teaching and\r\nimperfect knowledge of the materials and limits of painting. It is this\r\ngroping effort after truth which results often in the _naïve_ rendering\r\nof details, and the quaintness of composition, which are so common in\r\nthe works of these early masters; but the deep feeling of the artists\r\npenetrates through all, and thus even their awkward and imperfect drawing\r\nfrequently produces a stronger effect, and seems a better rendering of\r\nnature, than the cold, unfeeling, academic accuracy of Bologna, or all the\r\nfinished science of the eclectic schools.\r\n\r\nIn passing down through the century one finds lamentable omissions at\r\nManchester. Fifty pictures, of which half at least have been restored,\r\n(that is to say, in part or wholly spoiled,) and half originally the work\r\nof inferior masters, do not represent the art of a century which was full\r\nof the glow of reawakening life, and which, as the spring covers the\r\nearth with flowers, covered Italy with cathedrals, campaniles, churches,\r\nbaptisteries, and camposantos, and decorated their walls with sculpture and\r\npainting. Art was gaining gradually a knowledge of her own powers. Orgagna,\r\nthe Michel Angelo of his time, (one of his pictures is at Manchester,) was\r\nopening a wider field for her progress; and ten years after his death Fra\r\nAngelico was born. He was a boy of fifteen years old when in 1402 Masaccio\r\nwas born at Florence, and the brightness of the fifteenth century had\r\nbegun.\r\n\r\nThere is one, among the four pictures ascribed to Fra Angelico in this\r\ncollection, from which something of the heavenly purity, the sweetness,\r\nand the tenderness of this great and gentle master may be learned. It is a\r\npicture of the Last Judgment. Unfortunately, it has been much injured by\r\ntime and by neglect; its brilliant colors have sunk and become dim,--those\r\npure, clear colors which give to Fra Angelico's panel pictures the\r\nbrilliancy of a missal illumination, and which reflect the purity and the\r\nclearness of his tranquil life and his reverential soul. It is no fanciful\r\ntheory which connects the uses of color with moral qualities, and which\r\nfrom the coloring of a picture will deduce something of the moral character\r\nof its painter. Thus it is not only from the exquisite delicacy of form,\r\nthe spirituality of expression, and the sweet, reverent fancy in attitude,\r\nof the angels from which Fra Angelico derived his name, but also from the\r\nbrightness of their golden wings, from the deep glow of their crimson, or\r\nscarlet, or azure robes, and from the clear shining of the stars on their\r\nforeheads, that one learns that he deserved that name as characteristic of\r\nhis temper and his life. Something of the influence of the cloister shows\r\nitself in most of his larger works; but if his vision was narrowed within\r\nconvent walls, it did but pierce the more clearly into the regions of\r\ntranquillity and loveliness that lay above them.\r\n\r\nWith the end of the fifteenth century religion almost disappears from Art.\r\nJohn Bellini, dying ninety years old in 1516, was the last and one of the\r\ngreatest of the long line of artists who had loved Art as the means granted\r\nthem of serving God upon earth. The manly vigor of his conceptions, the\r\ntender and holy purity of his imagination, the delicate strength of his\r\nfancy, are not to be discovered in the few pictures that bear his name at\r\nManchester. His pictures are to be fairly seen only at Venice, where, in\r\nout-of-the-way churches, over tawdry altars, his colors gleam undimmed\r\nby time, and the faces of his Virgins look down with a still celestial\r\nsweetness. But there is one picture here, by a Venetian contemporary\r\nof John Bellini, before which we shall do well to pause. It is a St.\r\nCatharine, by Cima da Conegliano. It is the picture of a noble woman, full\r\nof fortitude, serenity, and faith. The richness of the color of her dress,\r\nher calm dignity, the composure of her attitude, recall to mind and make\r\nher the worthy companion of the beautiful St. Barbara of the church of\r\nSanta Maria Formosa. It is well to look at her, for we are coming to those\r\ndays when such saints as these were no longer painted; but in their places\r\nwhole tribes of figures with faces twisted into every trick of sentimental\r\ndevotion, imbecile piety, and pretended fervor.\r\n\r\nBut before this time, somewhere about the middle of the fifteenth century,\r\nthe fashion of painting pictures upon panel for private purposes, though as\r\nyet religious subjects were principally chosen for treatment, had already\r\nbegun; and we find the masters of the early part of the sixteenth century\r\nrepresented with tolerable fulness at Manchester. English collectors have\r\nlong had a passion for Raphael, and England is almost as rich in his works\r\nin oils as Italy herself. Italy, however, keeps his frescos; and may she\r\nlong keep them! There are more than thirty works ascribed to Raphael\r\nhanging on the walls of the Exhibition. Many of them are of doubtful\r\ngenuineness; many of them have been restored.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to trace in these pictures the progress of Raphael's\r\nmanner, and to mark the development of his style; but even in these one may\r\nsee something of the change from the simplicity and feeling of his early\r\nworks, produced under the influence of religious sentiment, and the still\r\nclinging stiffness of traditional restraints, to the freedom and coldness\r\nof his later works, painted under the influence of success at a dissolute\r\ncourt, of flattery, of jealousy, and of indifference to the motives of\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nThe Venetian masters of the sixteenth century fill a large portion of the\r\nsides of one of the great saloons of this aisle, covering it with a glow of\r\ndeepest color. The opposite side is hung with many pictures by Rubens; and\r\nthe contrast between the works of the mighty colorists of Venice and the\r\nfamous colorist of Antwerp is not without curious interest and instruction.\r\nThe Venice wall has the color of Venetian sunsets, the gold and crimson\r\nof its clouds, the solemn blue of the Cadore hills, the deep green of the\r\nlagoons, the brown and purple of the seaweeds, and the shadows of the city\r\nof decaying palaces. Here are such harmonies as Nature strikes in her great\r\nsymphony of color. But on the other wall are the colors of the courts in\r\nwhich Rubens passed so many of his days,--the dyes of tapestry, the sheen\r\nof jewels and velvet, the glaring crimson and yellow of royal displays;\r\nwhile the harmonies that he strikes out with his rapid and powerful hand\r\nare like those of the music of some great military band.\r\n\r\nThere are noble pictures here by Giorgione, and Titian, and Tintoret, and\r\nPaul Veronese, and Bonifazio. Look at this Musical Party by Giorgione, this\r\nlandscape by Titian, this portrait of the vile Duke of Alva by the same\r\ngreat master, the greatest master of all in portraiture. It is the Duke\r\nhimself, not merely in his outward presence, but such as the insight of\r\none as profoundly versed in human as in external nature beheld him. The\r\nportrait is a biography of the man, and one may read in the narrow, hard,\r\nand wily face the history of his cruel life. The same qualities of inward\r\nvision are displayed by Tintoret in his more hasty portraits, and one\r\nlearns as much of Venetian men and of their lives from the pencil of Titian\r\nand of Tintoret as from the pens of contemporary chroniclers. The picture\r\nby Bonifazio of a Virgin and Child surrounded by saints is a splendid\r\nexample of this almost unsurpassed colorist; while several of the pictures\r\nby Paul Veronese are among the most precious things in all the Exhibition,\r\nas clear and uninjured specimens of admirable Venetian work.\r\n\r\nThe Bolognese school is represented at Manchester out of all proportion to\r\nits worth, in comparison with the earlier and greater schools of Italy. It\r\nis essentially the school of decline, and, after the time of Francia, very\r\nfew pictures proceeded from it dignified by noble thought, or exhibiting\r\neither purity or power of imagination. Its very method condemned it\r\nto inferiority. But debased as it is, it has been during the last two\r\ncenturies the object of perhaps more real and affected admiration than any\r\nother of the schools of Italian art. Fortunately, we have entered upon a\r\nbetter period of criticism, and a change is fast coming over the public\r\ntaste. But it is a curious fact, that the most popular picture in the whole\r\ngallery of ancient masters, the picture before which larger crowds assemble\r\nand linger than before any other, is one from this school,--the three\r\nMaries weeping over the body of the Saviour, by Annibale Caracci. A portion\r\nof the interest which it excites undoubtedly arises from the report that\r\nLouis Napoleon has offered the sum of £20,000 for it to its possessor, the\r\nEarl of Carlisle; but its intrinsic qualities are such as to explain much\r\nof its attraction for uneducated eyes. The attitudes of the figures are\r\nviolent and theatrical, the colors are strong, the surface is smooth, the\r\nsubject is easily recognized and of general interest. But whatever value\r\nbe set upon these points, it is an example of many of the worst defects of\r\nthe school. The expressions of the figures are exaggerated and unnatural,\r\nthe color, though strong, is cold and inharmonious, the drawing feeble and\r\nincorrect, the sentiment inconceivably material. It is a true exponent of\r\nthe low ebb of artistic power and of religious feeling at the period at\r\nwhich it was painted.\r\n\r\nBut we are delaying too long in these halls of the old painters. We have\r\nscarcely looked at a tithe of the eleven hundred pictures that hang around,\r\nand we must pass by with only a glance the long lines of German, Flemish,\r\nand Dutch works, and the rows of pictures by the great Spanish masters. We\r\ncan but see how much there is for pleasure and for study, and wish in vain\r\nto pause before Rembrandt, and Cuyp, and Ruysdael, and Vandyck, before\r\nMurillo and Velasquez.\r\n\r\nWe come out into the nave, and, forgetting for a time pictures as works of\r\nart, let us look at them as representations of men, as we pass along before\r\nthe portraits of British worthies, with which the two sides of this great\r\nhall are hung. It is a gallery of which every one of British blood may be\r\nproud; for no other country could show such a long line of the portraits\r\nof her famous men, and feel at the same time that so many of her greatest\r\nwere not to be found in the collection. The gallery begins with a portrait\r\nof King Henry IV.; it ends with that of Mr. Prescott. After nearly four\r\nhundred English worthies, at last one American,--and only one; for in the\r\nwhole collection there is but one other portrait of an American,--West, the\r\npainter,--and he was English by adoption, though not by birth. We could\r\nspare his fame without great loss, but it would not do for us to give\r\nup that of our popular historian. In the next great assemblage of the\r\nportraits of the worthies of the English race and speech, perhaps those\r\nborn on this side of the Atlantic may appear in larger numbers and in even\r\nrank of honor.\r\n\r\nThe first portrait on the catalogue is that of King Henry IV.; but he has\r\ndisplaced here, as in life, his predecessor on the throne. Henry VI. and\r\nRichard III. follow in near succession; but it is not till Henry VIII.'s\r\ntime that we really enter upon the field of English portraiture. We begin\r\nwith the king himself. Here is Holbein's famous picture of him; a picture\r\nthat represents a man so gross, so sensual, so disgusting in appearance,\r\nthat one recognizes its truth, and wonders that the court-painter did not\r\nlose his head for such a libellous sincerity.\r\n\r\nWolsey is near his master; his face is that of a man \"exceeding wise,\r\nfair-spoken, and persuading\"; he has a large, full brow, narrow and shrewd\r\neyes, a delicate nose, and somewhat heavy and sensual cheeks. A little\r\nlater the portraits become more numerous. Of Queen Elizabeth there are\r\nseven here, and in them may be traced the great changes of her face,--from\r\nthat of the plain, awkward, not altogether unpleasing, red-haired girl, to\r\nthat of the hard, bitter, disappointed old woman. Some of her courtiers\r\nsurround her;--Leicester, with a treacherous uncertainty of expression;\r\nand Burleigh, riding on a mule, and holding flowers in his hand,--an\r\nodd representation of the great Lord Treasurer. And here, too, is Henry\r\nWriothesley, the Earl of Southampton, finding a deserved place among the\r\nchief men of his time,--for he was Shakspeare's friend, and to him the\r\n\"Rape of Lucrece\" was dedicated, with the words, \"What I have done is\r\nyours; what I have to do is yours; being part in all I have devoted yours.\"\r\nHere is Holbein's portrait of Sir Walter Raleigh, with the face of a true\r\nknight. Sidney is not here, but \"Sidney's sister, Pembroke's mother,\" has\r\nan honored place,--and though her portrait is not of so \"fair\" a woman as\r\none might desire to have seen her, it has the look of a woman \"wise and\r\ngood.\" And here are Shakspeare and Ben Jonson themselves;--the Chandos\r\nportrait of Shakspeare, with which all the world is familiar, more\r\ninteresting from its own fame than from its being either an authentic or a\r\nsatisfactory likeness of the poet; and Ben Jonson close by, with his strong\r\nfeatures and manly face. And Fletcher, and Shirley, and Dick Burbadge, who\r\nfirst acted Hamlet, and whose picture explains why the queen should say,\r\n\"He's fat and scant of breath,\"--and others of the same great band of\r\ncontemporaries. Their heads belong for the most part to one broad type;\r\ntheir common characteristics are strongly marked. There were never finer\r\nheads than these;--the broad, uplifted, solidly based skulls; the strong\r\nand vigorous marking of the features, giving evidence, both in shape and in\r\nexpression, of the union of pure intellect and pure imagination. Compare\r\nwith them the heads of the wits and statesmen of Charles II.'s time. See\r\nthe difference;--the high, wide arch of the skull is lowered or narrowed;\r\nthe broad brow cramped; the features finer cut, but losing in force what\r\nthey gain in fineness. Look, for instance, at this Vandyck of Sir John\r\nSuckling,--only the next generation after the great men; but his portrait\r\nis that of an idler, his head that of a man without great thoughts or great\r\ninterests. The age of imagination had passed; the age of fancy was setting\r\nin. Here and there in the later days one finds a man who might belong to\r\nthe earlier time;--for instance, this likeness of Sir Henry Wotton, also by\r\nVandyck, gives us a broad and noble head; but one sees the time to which\r\nhe belonged in his somewhat affected meditative attitude, and in the word\r\n_Philosophemur_, which is inscribed upon the canvas. The finest type of\r\nhead which England has had since the time of Elizabeth was that developed\r\namong the Roundheads. _Round_ heads they were, and noble heads too. They\r\nare well represented here. Look at this portrait of Cromwell;--it has\r\nthe same character and expression with that still nobler likeness of\r\nhim which he sent to the Duke of Tuscany, and which hangs now in one\r\nof the back halls of the Pitti Gallery, a stern, silent monitor to the\r\ndull Florentines. Frederick Tennyson said of it, that it was the best\r\nbattle-piece he ever saw;--\"In its red ruggedness it looks as if it had\r\nbeen sketched in by the gleam of Dunbar's cannon flashes.\" Hampden,\r\nEliot, and Pym, with wide individual differences, all belong to the same\r\nclass;--the lines of their faces, which in Hampden and in Eliot have\r\nsettled into a cast of resolute melancholy, and in Pym betray the sternness\r\nof his nature, tell in all of the hard discipline of their lives, and the\r\nupright patriotism of their hearts. Compare the faces of these patriots\r\nwith those of the leaders of the French Revolutions. The Cavaliers, with\r\na type of head less fine, were for the most part handsomer men than the\r\nRoundheads. Here is Lovelace, the poet, for instance; Aubrey says of him,\r\n\"He was an extraordinary handsome man,\" and this likeness bears out the\r\nassertion. His face has a look of enthusiasm and of gallantry, appropriate\r\nto the man who could write, \"Stone walls do not a prison make.\" With the\r\nportraits of Brooke, and Fairfax, and Falkland, and Astley, and others of\r\nthe time, the comparison between Roundhead and Cavalier might be carried\r\nstill farther,--but we must pass on.\r\n\r\nThe portrait of Hobbes of Malmesbury, as an old man, hangs near that of Sir\r\nThomas Browne. It is a curious contrast between the imaginative and the\r\nunimaginative philosopher,--between the student of innumerable books, and\r\nthe cynic who declared that \"he should know as little as other men, if he\r\nhad read as many books.\"\r\n\r\nThere is a whole bevy here of the famous beauties of Charles II.'s\r\ncourt,--full of the affected airs and languishing graces which Sir Peter\r\nLely knew well how to paint, and rarely showing any thing in their\r\nportraits of the sprightliness which some of them at least possessed in\r\nlife. The only one of Sir Peter's full-length beauties, who calls up any\r\nassociations but such as belong to Grammont's Memoirs, is Margaret Lucas,\r\nthe Duchess of Newcastle. Who does not know her through Charles Lamb, and\r\nlove her for Charles Lamb's sake? She looks out of place here, between\r\nCharles II. and the Duchess of Cleveland; and it was not in a fancy dress\r\nof most fantastic style that she wrote her memoir of her husband,--in which\r\nshe tells of what My Lord would eat at dinner, as well as collects the wise\r\nthings which dropped from My Lord's lips.\r\n\r\nThe worthy Secretary Pepys appears here, in \"an excellent conceited\r\npicture,\" of which he himself has told the story in his Diary:--\r\n\r\n\"1666, March 17. To Hales's, and paid him £14 for the picture, and £1 5s.\r\nfor the frame. This day I began to sit, and he will make me, I think, a\r\nvery fine picture. He promises it shall be as good as my wife's; and I sit\r\nto have it full of shadows, and do almost break my neck looking over my\r\nshoulder, to make the posture for him to work by.\"\r\n\r\n\"March 30. To Hales's, and there sat till almost quite dark upon working my\r\ngowne, which I hired to be drawn in; an Indian gowne.\"\r\n\r\n\"April 11. To Hales's, where there was nothing found to be done more to my\r\npicture, but the musique, which now pleases me mightily, it being painted\r\ntrue.\" [Footnote: Mr. Peter Cunningham has quoted these passages in his\r\nexcellent catalogue of the gallery.]\r\n\r\nAnd here is Kneller's familiar portrait of John Evelyn, the other diarist\r\nof the times. And Lely's portrait of Rochester, the _roué_, represented in\r\nthe characteristic act of crowning his monkey with laurel,--laurel to\r\nwhich he sometimes aspired himself. And Kneller's portrait of Lord William\r\nRussell, with a face that answers better to the character of the man, as it\r\nappeared before he was brought face to face with death, and forced to exert\r\nand to display the manlier qualities of his nature.\r\n\r\nThe men of letters of the end of the 17th and the beginning of the 18th\r\ncentury appear here in great force. With the faces of most of them the\r\nworld is familiar. Here are six of the Kit-Kat Club portraits that\r\nwere painted for Jacob Tonson. First in order Tonson himself, the very\r\npersonification of the nourishing publisher and patron of authors, with\r\nthe pleasant air of the happy discoverer of genius, and the maker of its\r\nfortune as well as of his own. He holds a folio copy of \"Paradise Lost\"; it\r\nis Tonson patting Milton on the back. Dryden, Vanbrugh, Congreve, Steele,\r\nAddison, and Lord Chancellor Somers are the other five of these celebrated\r\nportraits. What a congress of wits! But we have besides, Atterbury, and\r\nPope, and Lady Mary Wortley Montague, and Prior, and Tickell, and Swift.\r\nPope's face, as given in Kneller's portrait, (which recalls the poet's\r\nstolen complimentary verse to the painter,) has a sad and weary look, and\r\nis marked by that pallor, and that peculiar hollowness of eye and cheek,\r\nwhich often accompany bodily deformity. Swift's face betrays but little\r\nof the bitterness of his soul; but it was painted in his best days,\r\nbefore the cloud of darkness had begun to settle down upon him. It is the\r\nportrait of him as he was in London, among his set,--not as he was in the\r\nhalf-banishment of his Irish life.\r\n\r\nThe end of the century brings us to other familiar portraits, and at length\r\nto portraits painted by great native artists. Gainsborough and Reynolds\r\nappear in full rivalry. Here are Gainsborough's Johnson, the well-known\r\nprofile portrait, and Sir Joshua's Boswell; Gainsborough's Garrick, a most\r\ndelightful portrait of Garrick's pleasantest expression, and Sir Joshua's\r\nGibbon, which looks as ugly and as conceited as the little man himself.\r\nOne of Reynolds's most pleasing portraits is his likeness of himself in\r\nspectacles. It has suffered from the fading of colors and the cracking of\r\nthe paint, as so many of Sir Joshua's best pictures have done; but it still\r\npresents him amiable, cultivated, and unpretending, the accomplished artist\r\nand the kindly friend, and affords the best possible illustration of the\r\ncharacter which Goldsmith drew of him in his \"Retaliation.\"\r\n\r\nWe pass rapidly before the portraits of the present century. Every one\r\nknows by heart the faces of Scott and Byron, Southey and Coleridge. But\r\nthere is one little portrait, hung at the end of the gallery, in front of\r\nwhich we pause. It has no remarkable merit as a work of art, but it is the\r\nportrait of Keats, painted in Rome by his friend Severn. The young poet is\r\nresting his head on his hand, as if it were heavy and tired. His face has a\r\nlook of illness; his eyes are large, and the spaces around them are hollow.\r\nHis wide and well-formed brow, and all the features, betray a temperament\r\ndelicate, passionate, and sensitive to excess. This portrait was painted,\r\naccording to tradition, in the little summer-house studio, at the corner\r\nof the Via Strozzi. The windows look out over the garden with its cypress\r\nwalks, its old pine trees, its rows of cabbages and artichokes, its\r\nweather-stained statues and bits of ancient marbles. Beyond are the walls\r\nof Rome, and beyond these the Campagna stretches away in level lines of\r\nbeauty to the blue billow of the Alban hills. On this view the eyes of the\r\ndying poet rested, while his heart gave no prophecy to him of coming fame.\r\nWould it have cheered him, during those last disheartened days, to have\r\nforeseen that so soon England would rank him among her honored children,\r\nand place his portrait in the gallery of the most worthy of her dead; while\r\na line of his writing, \"A thing of beauty is a joy forever,\" should be\r\nemblazoned in glowing letters at the end of the great hall of her first\r\ngreat Palace of Art?\r\n\r\nWe come now to the northern aisle, the aisle which contains the works of\r\nthe British school of painters. It is the most complete of the sections of\r\nthis great collection of pictures, and the lessons which are to be learned\r\nfrom it of the present condition and prospects of Art are of the highest\r\ninterest. Here are six hundred pictures, the English record of about a\r\nhundred years of painting. Never before has there been such a collection\r\nof the works of English painters, and never before has there been an\r\nopportunity of studying so fully and satisfactorily the course and progress\r\nof the English school.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this school hardly dates before the first quarter of the\r\nlast century. Public taste was then at its lowest level. The fall of Art\r\nin Italy, in the preceding century, had carried down with it both the\r\nappreciation and the feeling for what was truly good. A factitious taste\r\nhad taken the place of honest and simple likings. The worst things were\r\noften preferred, the worst pictures bought. Artists, as a class, had given\r\nup the study of Nature as the foundation of Art; and in the place of\r\nNature, they had put other men's pictures. They had substituted a system\r\nof conventional rules and traditional methods, for the infinite variety\r\nand the unceasing study of truth. They preferred falsehood, they liked\r\nimitation, and their patrons soon came to consider the feeble results of\r\nfalsehood and imitation as better than honest work and strong originality.\r\nOf course, here and there was a man whose native love of truth or spirit\r\nof opposition would give him strength to break loose from the fetters of\r\nartistic convention and prevailing taste, and to exhibit the truth in his\r\npictures. Such a man was the first great artist of the English school,\r\nHogarth; the greatest humorist of a century rich in humorists, with a\r\nknowledge of human nature that reminds one sometimes of Fielding's in its\r\nclearness and variety, sometimes of Goldsmith's in its tender pleasantry.\r\nBut Hogarth had to struggle all his life against the taste of his time,\r\nwhich was unable to appreciate his merit. He was too natural for an\r\nartificial age. Among the pictures exhibited here is one from his famous\r\nseries of the Harlot's Progress. It is too well known by the engravings to\r\nneed description; but when the eight masterly pictures which compose this\r\nseries were sold at auction during Hogarth's life, they brought the sum of\r\nfourteen guineas each! The March of the Guards to Finchley, so admirable in\r\ncomposition, so full of incident and character, so rich in humor, could not\r\nbe sold by the artist, and he disposed of it in a lottery, in which many\r\ntickets were left on his hands. And while this was the fate of works which\r\nstill stand unsurpassed in their peculiar field, the amateurs were paying\r\nenormous prices for worthless pictures of second-rate Italian masters, and\r\ntalking about their \"Correggios and Raphaels and stuff.\"\r\n\r\nFrom Hogarth to Sir Joshua Reynolds is a wide step. Sir Joshua is well\r\nrepresented here by some thirty pictures; and Gainsborough is at his side\r\nwith perhaps half as many. If Sir Joshua had not been a man of genius,\r\nhe would have been ruined by his academic principles. He laid down rules\r\nwhich he constantly violated. He praised the Bolognese masters, and advised\r\nall students of Art in Italy to study at Bologna; but he did not confine\r\nhimself to the study of other men's works, but sometimes gave himself, with\r\nhonest sincerity and affection, to the study of Nature; and thus it is that\r\nit becomes hard to draw the line of praise between some of his pictures and\r\nsome of those by Gainsborough, and to say which are the best. Gainsborough\r\nwas no academician; he did not believe in conventionalities. When Sir\r\nJoshua laid down as a rule that blue was bad as a prevailing color in\r\npictures, Gainsborough painted his famous Blue Boy, and made one of the\r\nmost charming portraits and pleasantest pictures that had ever been painted\r\nin England. Look at Sir Joshua's delightful, winning Nelly O'Brien,--what\r\na happy picture of a girl!--and then look at Gainsborough's Mrs. Graham,\r\nwith her exquisite, perhaps even too exquisite, beauty; and see, not which\r\nof the artists was the best, for that it is hard to see, but how great\r\nboth were as students and renderers of human nature. One of the best of\r\nReynolds's portraits is that of Foote, the actor. He is leaning over a\r\nchair, and his laughing face is looking out from the canvas, as if he\r\nwere watching the effect of one of his own most brilliant and easy jokes.\r\nBut Sir Joshua does not compare with Gainsborough in landscape; there the\r\nlover of Nature had the advantage over the lover of Poussin and Claude.\r\nThe famous picture of Puck, which Lord Fitzwilliam lately bought at Mr.\r\nRogers's sale for the extravagant sum of nine hundred and eighty guineas,\r\nis here for all eyes to see how far the imagination of the President of the\r\nRoyal Academy differed from that of Shakspeare.\r\n\r\nBut the principles which Sir Joshua laid down, though they did not ruin\r\nhis own works, did much to ruin those of the next generation of painters.\r\nThere was still the struggle between the painters by rule and according to\r\nconvention, and the painters of truth as found in Nature. But the painters\r\nof Nature were in a minority so small as to be powerless against the\r\nprevailing current. English Art seemed to be running down; cold formalisms,\r\nclassicalities, extravagances, affectations, imitations, \"high art,\"\r\noccupied the field almost to the exclusion of better things. West, Fuseli,\r\nNorthcote, Barry, Sir Thomas Lawrence, Haydon, Maclise, and Sir Charles\r\nEastlake form a famous line of painters who have been admired, but whose\r\nworks have little value except as warnings, and as showing into what errors\r\na false method and want of recognition of the foundation and the end of Art\r\nmay lead men not destitute of ability.\r\n\r\nBut while these men had their day, the school of the lovers of Nature as\r\nseen in the external world was making irregular progress. The overwhelming\r\npressure of conventional traditions is shown most forcibly, however, by\r\nthe fact that the great leader of this school of the students of landscape\r\nnature, the man to whom was given the power to see and to represent Nature\r\nin all the changing glories and beauties of her ceaselessly varying\r\nmoods, the man who knew the value of truth and set his desires upon it\r\naccordingly,--that this man should have been for years of his life kept\r\ndown to the imitation of and competition with the works of painters of\r\nprevious centuries who were supposed to have painted landscapes. But it was\r\nPegasus running a race with cart-horses. He had reached the goal which they\r\nhad never aspired after. There are nineteen pictures of Turner's here at\r\nManchester; some of them among his noblest works. Here is his Cologne at\r\nSunset; look at it, for the picture will fade before your eyes, and you\r\nwill stand looking at the golden glow of evening over the church towers,\r\nand the gleaming river of the ancient city.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of Turner's power, and the commencement of a better period\r\nof public taste and feeling, as marked not only in Art, but in letters, the\r\nstudy of Nature became more manifest in the English school. In different\r\ndirections, and with different degrees of success, many artists, but\r\ngenerally with more or less faltering, broke away from the old system.\r\nWilkie, Etty, Constable, Collins, and others, often painted simple and\r\nsincere pictures, pictures that showed careful study and real love of\r\nNature. All these artists may be seen to advantage here. But in looking\r\nat the mass of the collection, one sees that the true principles of Art\r\nhave not even as yet been generally recognized by the majority of English\r\nartists. The last hall of the gallery, which is devoted to the works of\r\nliving artists, gives especial proof of this fact. But at the same time,\r\nit gives proof of the rise of a spirit among a small body of the younger\r\npainters, whose influence promises to be of strong and beneficial effect.\r\nThe artists among whom this spirit exists are the Pre-Raphaelites.\r\n\r\nGreat misconception exists with regard to the works and to the principles\r\nof Art of this school. The name by which it is known has in part occasioned\r\nthis misconception. It was not happily chosen; for these Pre-Raphaelites,\r\ninstead of being three centuries behind their times, are fully up with the\r\nday in which they live. Pre-Raphaelitism was not intended to mean, as it\r\nmight seem to imply, the going back to worn-out and obsolete methods of\r\npainting, the resort to past modes of representation; it does not mean the\r\nadoption of the artistic forms, traditions, or rules of the old painters;\r\nit does not mean the seeking of inspiration from the works of any other\r\nmen; but, in theory at least, it means the pursuit of Art in that spirit\r\nwhich the painters before Raphael possessed, the spirit which united Art\r\nwith Religion; it means the pursuit of Art with the humility of learners,\r\nwith the faith of apostles. It does not mean the reproduction of the\r\nquaintnesses, and awkwardnesses, and limitations of the early artists, more\r\nthan it means the adoption of the errors of their creed as exhibited in\r\ntheir paintings; but it means that as those artists broke loose from the\r\nbondage of Byzantine captivity, and found in Nature the source of all true\r\ninspiration, the exhaustless fountain from which their imaginations might\r\ndraw perpetual refreshment,--so these artists who took this name would free\r\nthemselves from whatever they could discern to be false in the teaching\r\nand practice of Art in our times, and give themselves to the study of that\r\nbeauty and that truth which are to be found in God's world to-day, whether\r\nin external nature or in human hearts, actions, and lives. Truth was to be\r\ntheir device; Nature was to be their mistress. And in the ardor of youth,\r\nthey set forth for the conquest of new and untravelled lands.\r\n\r\nIt is greatly to be regretted that there should be but an inconsiderable\r\nnumber of pictures in this last hall of the English gallery by\r\nPre-Raphaelite artists. A little private exhibition of seventy-two pictures\r\nand drawings, by some twenty artists of this school, which was held in a\r\nsmall house in London, during the month of June, gave a far better view of\r\nwhat had been already accomplished by them, of the practical working out of\r\ntheir principles of Art, and of their present tendencies. Three men stand\r\nas the prominent leaders of the movement,--Rosetti, Hunt, and Millais.\r\nThere is not a single picture by Rosetti at Manchester; but two (if we\r\nremember rightly) by Millais; and although there are several by Hunt, there\r\nare none of his latest works, nor the most powerful and beautiful of his\r\ncomparatively early ones, the well-known Light of the World. Rosetti has\r\nnever, we believe, exhibited in public. But whether he paint Dante led in a\r\nvision by Love to see Beatrice lying dead,--or the Angel leading King and\r\nShepherd to adore the new-born Saviour, while the angelic choir in white\r\nrobes stand around the manger in the night, singing their song of Peace and\r\nGood-will,--or Queen Guinever and Sir Lancelot meeting in the autumn day\r\nat King Arthur's tomb,--or Mary of Magdala flying from the house of revels,\r\nand clasping the alabaster box of ointment to her bosom,--or Ophelia\r\nredelivering to Hamlet his gifts of remembrance, while he strips the leaves\r\nfrom a rosetree as he breaks her heart,--or the young farmer, who, having\r\ndriven his cart to London, and crossed one of the bridges over the black\r\nriver, finds in the cold, wet morning his old love, long lost, now fallen\r\nat the side of the street, fainting against the dead brick wall of a\r\ngraveyard; whether he paint these or other scenes, in all are to be found\r\nsuch sense of the higher truths of Nature and such faithful rendering of\r\nthem, such force of expression, and such beauty of conception, as place\r\nthem as works of imagination among the first that this age has produced.\r\nWith equal fidelity to Nature, with a more definite moral purpose, perhaps\r\nwith a more consistent steadiness of work, but with less delicate sense\r\nof beauty, and with imagination of a very different order, Hunt stands\r\nwith Rosetti in the front ranks of Pre-Raphaelitism. The earnestness and\r\ndirectness of moral expression in most of his pictures is such as has for\r\na long time been rare in Art. Art is with him a means of enforcing the\r\nrecognition of truths often avoided or carefully concealed. Their powerful\r\ndramatic character compels the attention of the careless to his pictures.\r\nHe paints Claudio and Isabella in the prison scene, and it is not merely\r\na vivid rendering of the scene in its external features, but also a true\r\nrendering of the character of Claudio and Isabella, of the weakness of the\r\ncoward, of the strength that dwells with the pure. His Awakened Conscience\r\nis a scene from the interior of London life; a denunciation of the vice\r\nof which the world is so careless; a sad, stern picture of the bitterness\r\nof sin. Millais is less in earnest, and his pictures, with many great\r\ntechnical merits, with portions of very exquisite painting, have rarely\r\npossessed any great worth as works of imagination. One of the tenderest\r\nof them all is the Huguenots, the girl and her lover parting, which is\r\nnow becoming generally known through the engraving that has recently been\r\npublished. The Autumn Leaves, which is exhibited at Manchester, is one of\r\nhis least satisfactory pictures.\r\n\r\nBut all these men are young, and what they have already accomplished is\r\nbut as the promise of greater things to come. It is impossible, however,\r\nto look forward for these greater things, without a feeling of doubt and\r\nuncertainty as to their being produced. The times in which we are living\r\nare not fitted to develope and confirm the qualities on which the best\r\nresults of Art depend. Ours is neither an age of composure nor of faith. It\r\nurges speedy results; it desires effective, rather than simple, truthful\r\nwork. But the Pre-Raphaelites are exposed to especial dangers; just now to\r\nthe dangers that come from success. And these are of two kinds; first, the\r\nundermining of that humility which is the secret of mastery; and secondly,\r\nthe tendency to the development of peculiarities and mannerisms, to the\r\nexaggeration of special features that have attracted attention in their\r\nwork, and which have a factitious value set upon them by the public, as\r\nthey are taken to be the signs and passwords of initiation into the new\r\nschool. But, lying deeper than these, there is a danger to Pre-Raphaelitism\r\nfrom the tendency to insist on too literal an application of its own\r\nprinciples. The best principles will not include all cases. The workings\r\nand ways of Nature are infinite, and the principles of Art are finite\r\ndeductions from these infinite examples. As yet these deductions have been\r\nbut imperfectly made. The most exact and truthful representation of Nature\r\nmay be the rule of the artist, but it is not an easy thing to attain to an\r\nunderstanding of the truth of Nature. The actual is not always the real.\r\nLiteral truth is not always exact truth; and the seeming truth, which is\r\nwhat Art must often represent, is very different from the absolute truth.\r\nAnd here there has been much stumbling in Pre-Raphaelitism, and there is\r\nlikelihood of fall; likelihood of the actual being mistaken for the real,\r\nthe show for the essence. It is, indeed, apparently, a tendency toward this\r\nerror which has deprived most of the best pictures of the Pre-Raphaelites\r\nof the quality of _breadth_, a quality which Nature usually preserves in\r\nherself, which in painting takes the place of harmony in music, and which\r\nonly the greatest painters have acquired.\r\n\r\nBut if Pre-Raphaelitism be true, not to the letter, but to the spirit\r\nof its principles,--if its artists remain unspoiled by flattery and\r\nsuccess,--if they avoid mannerisms, conceits, and the affectations of\r\noriginality,--if they can keep religious faith undimmed by the \"world's\r\nslow stain\"; then we may expect from the school such works of painting as\r\nhave not been seen in past times,--works which shall be the forerunners of\r\na new period of Art, and shall show what undreamed conquests yet lie open\r\nbefore it,--works which shall take us into regions of yet undiscovered\r\nbeauty, and reveal to us more and more of the exhaustless love of God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROMMANY GIRL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The sun goes down, and with him takes\r\n  The coarseness of my poor attire;\r\n  The fair moon mounts, and aye the flame\r\n  Of gypsy beauty blazes higher.\r\n\r\n  Pale northern girls! you scorn our race;\r\n  You captives of your air-tight halls,\r\n  Wear out in-doors your sickly days,\r\n  But leave us the horizon walls.\r\n\r\n  And if I take you, dames, to task,\r\n  And say it frankly without guile,\r\n  Then you are gypsies in a mask,\r\n  And I the lady all the while.\r\n\r\n  If, on the heath, under the moon,\r\n  I court and play with paler blood,\r\n  Me false to mine dare whisper none,--\r\n  One sallow horseman knows me good.\r\n\r\n  Go, keep your cheek's rose from the rain,\r\n  For teeth and hair with shopmen deal;\r\n  My swarthy tint is in the grain,\r\n  The rocks and forest know it real.\r\n\r\n  The wild air bloweth in our lungs,\r\n  The keen stars twinkle in our eyes,\r\n  The birds gave us our wily tongues,\r\n  The panther in our dances flies.\r\n\r\n  You doubt we read the stars on high,\r\n  Nathless we read your fortunes true;\r\n  The stars may hide in the upper sky,\r\n  But without glass we fathom you.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHARTIST'S COMPLAINT.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Day! hast thou two faces,\r\n  Making one place two places?\r\n  One, by humble farmer seen,\r\n  Chill and wet, unlighted, mean,\r\n  Useful only, triste and damp,\r\n  Serving for a laborer's lamp?\r\n  Have the same mists another side,\r\n  To be the appanage of pride,\r\n  Gracing the rich man's wood and lake,\r\n  His park where amber mornings break,\r\n  And treacherously bright to show\r\n  His planted isle where roses glow?\r\n  O Day! and is your mightiness\r\n  A sycophant to smug success?\r\n  Will the sweet sky and ocean broad\r\n  Be fine accomplices to fraud?\r\n  O Sun! I curse thy cruel ray!\r\n  Back, back to chaos, harlot Day!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAYS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days,\r\n  Muffled and dumb, like barefoot dervishes,\r\n  And marching single in an endless file,\r\n  Bring diadems and fagots in their hands.\r\n  To each they offer gifts, after his will,--\r\n  Bread, kingdoms, stars, or sky that holds them all.\r\n  I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,\r\n  Forgot my morning wishes, hastily\r\n  Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day\r\n  Turned and departed silent. I, too late,\r\n  Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRAHMA.\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the red slayer think he slays,\r\n  Or if the slain think he is slain,\r\n  They know not well the subtle ways\r\n  I keep, and pass, and turn again.\r\n\r\n  Far or forgot to me is near,\r\n  Shadow and sunlight are the same,\r\n  The vanished gods to me appear,\r\n  And one to me are shame and fame.\r\n\r\n  They reckon ill who leave me out;\r\n  When me they fly, I am the wings;\r\n  I am the doubter and the doubt,\r\n  And I the hymn the Brahmin sings.\r\n\r\n  The strong gods pine for my abode,\r\n  And pine in vain the sacred Seven;\r\n  But thou, meek lover of the good!\r\n  Find me, and turn thy back on heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTOCRAT OF THE BREAKFAST-TABLE.\r\n\r\nEVERY MAN HIS OWN BOSWELL.\r\n\r\n\r\nI was just going to say, when I was interrupted, that one of the many ways\r\nof classifying minds is under the heads of arithmetical and algebraical\r\nintellects. All economical and practical wisdom is an extension or\r\nvariation of the following arithmetical formula: 2 + 2 = 4. Every\r\nphilosophical proposition has the more general character of the expression\r\n_a + b = c_. We are mere operatives, empirics, and egotists, until we learn\r\nto think in letters instead of figures.\r\n\r\nThey all stared. There is a divinity student lately come among us to whom\r\nI commonly address remarks like the above, allowing him to take a certain\r\nshare in the conversation, so far as assent or pertinent questions are\r\ninvolved. He abused his liberty on this occasion by presuming to say that\r\nLeibnitz had the same observation.--No, sir, I replied, he has not. But he\r\nsaid a mighty good thing about mathematics, that sounds something like it,\r\nand you found it, _not in the original_, but quoted by Dr. Thomas Reid. I\r\nwill tell the company what he did say, one of these days.\r\n\r\n--If I belong to a Society of Mutual Admiration?--I blush to say that\r\nI do not at this present moment. I once did, however. It was the first\r\nassociation to which I ever heard the term applied; a body of scientific\r\nyoung men in a great foreign city who admired their teacher, and to some\r\nextent each other. Many of them deserved it; they have become famous\r\nsince. It amuses me to hear the talk of one of those beings described by\r\nThackeray--\r\n\r\n  \"Letters four do form his name\"--\r\n\r\nabout a social development which belongs to the very noblest stage of\r\ncivilization. All generous companies of artists, authors, philanthropists,\r\nmen of science, are, or ought to be, Societies of Mutual Admiration. A man\r\nof genius, or any kind of superiority, is not debarred from admiring the\r\nsame quality in another, nor the other from returning his admiration. They\r\nmay even associate together and continue to think highly of each other. And\r\nso of a dozen such men, if any one place is fortunate enough to hold so\r\nmany. The being referred to above assumes several false premises. First,\r\nthat men of talent necessarily hate each other. Secondly, that intimate\r\nknowledge or habitual association destroys our admiration of persons\r\nwhom we esteemed highly at a distance. Thirdly, that a circle of clever\r\nfellows, who meet together to dine and have a good time, have signed a\r\nconstitutional compact to glorify themselves and put down him and the\r\nfraction of the human race not belonging to their number. Fourthly, that it\r\nis an outrage that he is not asked to join them.\r\n\r\nHere the company laughed a good deal, and the old gentleman who sits\r\nopposite said, \"That's it! that's it!\"\r\n\r\nI continued, for I was in the talking vein. As to clever people's hating\r\neach other, I think a _little_ extra talent does sometimes make people\r\njealous. They become irritated by perpetual attempts and failures, and it\r\nhurts their tempers and dispositions. Unpretending mediocrity is good, and\r\ngenius is glorious; but a weak flavor of genius in an essentially common\r\nperson is detestable. It spoils the grand neutrality of a commonplace\r\ncharacter, as the rinsings of an unwashed wineglass spoil a draught of\r\nfair water. No wonder the poor fellow we spoke of, who always belongs to\r\nthis class of slightly flavored mediocrities, is puzzled and vexed by the\r\nstrange sight of a dozen men of capacity working and playing together in\r\nharmony. He and his fellows are always fighting. With them familiarity\r\nnaturally breeds contempt. If they ever praise each other's bad drawings,\r\nor broken-winded novels, or spavined verses, nobody ever supposed it\r\nwas from admiration; it was simply a contract between themselves and a\r\npublisher or dealer.\r\n\r\nIf the Mutuals have really nothing among them worth admiring, that alters\r\nthe question. But if they are men with noble powers and qualities, let\r\nme tell you, that, next to youthful love and family affections, there is\r\nno human sentiment better than that which unites the Societies of Mutual\r\nAdmiration. And what would literature or art be without such associations?\r\nWho can tell what we owe to the Mutual Admiration Society of which\r\nShakspeare, and Ben Jonson, and Beaumont and Fletcher were members? Or\r\nto that of which Addison and Steele formed the centre, and which gave us\r\nthe Spectator? Or to that where Johnson, and Goldsmith, and Burke, and\r\nReynolds, and Beauclerk, and Boswell, most admiring among all admirers,\r\nmet together? Was there any great harm in the fact that the Irvings and\r\nPaulding wrote in company? or any unpardonable cabal in the literary union\r\nof Verplanck and Bryant and Sands, and as many more as they chose to\r\nassociate with them?\r\n\r\nThe poor creature does not know what he is talking about, when he abuses\r\nthis noblest of institutions. Let him inspect its mysteries through the\r\nknot-hole he has secured, but not use that orifice as a medium for his\r\npopgun. Such a society is the crown of a literary metropolis; if a town has\r\nnot material for it, and spirit and good feeling enough to organize it, it\r\nis a mere caravansary, fit for a man of genius to lodge in, but not to live\r\nin. Foolish people hate and dread and envy such an association of men of\r\nvaried powers and influence, because it is lofty, serene, impregnable, and,\r\nby the necessity of the case, exclusive. Wise ones are prouder of the title\r\nM.S.M.A. than of all their other honors put together.\r\n\r\nAll generous minds have a horror of what are commonly called \"facts.\" They\r\nare the brute beasts of the intellectual domain. Who does not know fellows\r\nthat always have an ill-conditioned fact or two that they lead after them\r\ninto decent company like so many bull-dogs, ready to let them slip at every\r\ningenious suggestion, or convenient generalization, or pleasant fancy? I\r\nallow no \"facts\" at this table. What! Because bread is good and wholesome\r\nand necessary and nourishing, shall you thrust a crumb into my windpipe\r\nwhile I am talking? Do not these muscles of mine represent a hundred loaves\r\nof bread? and is not my thought the abstract of ten thousand of these\r\ncrumbs of truth with which you would choke off my speech?\r\n\r\n[The above remark must be conditioned and qualified for the vulgar mind.\r\nThe reader will of course understand the precise amount of seasoning which\r\nmust be added to it before he adopts it as one of the axioms of his life.\r\nThe speaker disclaims all responsibility for its abuse in incompetent\r\nhands.]\r\n\r\nThis business of conversation is a very serious matter. There are men\r\nthat it weakens one to talk with an hour more than a day's fasting would\r\ndo. Mark this that I am going to say, for it is as good as a working\r\nprofessional man's advice, and costs you nothing: It is better to lose a\r\npint of blood from your veins than to have a nerve tapped. Nobody measures\r\nyour nervous force as it runs away, nor bandages your brain and marrow\r\nafter the operation.\r\n\r\nThere are men of _esprit_ who are excessively exhausting to some people.\r\nThey are the talkers that have what may be called _jerky_ minds. Their\r\nthoughts do not run in the natural order of sequence. They say bright\r\nthings on all possible subjects, but their zigzags rack you to death. After\r\na jolting half-hour with one of these jerky companions, talking with a dull\r\nfriend affords great relief. It is like taking the cat in your lap after\r\nholding a squirrel.\r\n\r\nWhat a comfort a dull but kindly person is, to be sure, at times! A\r\nground-glass shade over a gas-lamp does not bring more solace to our\r\ndazzled eyes than such a one to our minds.\r\n\r\n\"Do not dull people bore you?\" said one of the lady-boarders,--the same\r\nthat sent me her autograph-book last week with a request for a few original\r\nstanzas, not remembering that \"The Pactolian\" pays me five dollars a line\r\nfor every thing I write in its columns.\r\n\r\n\"Madam,\" said I, (she and the century were in their teens together,) \"all\r\nmen are bores, except when we want them. There never was but one man that I\r\nwould trust with my latch-key.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who might that favored person be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Zimmermann.\"\r\n\r\nThe men of genius that I fancy most have erectile heads like the\r\ncobra-di-capello. You remember what they tell of William Pinkney, the great\r\npleader; how in his eloquent paroxysms the veins of his neck would swell\r\nand his face flush and his eyes glitter, until he seemed on the verge of\r\napoplexy. The hydraulic arrangements for supplying the brain with blood\r\nare only second in importance to its own organization. The bulbous-headed\r\nfellows that steam well when they are at work are the men that draw big\r\naudiences and give us marrowy books and pictures. It is a good sign to have\r\none's feet grow cold when he is writing. A great writer and speaker once\r\ntold me that he often wrote with his feet in hot water; but for this, _all_\r\nhis blood would have run into his head, as the mercury sometimes withdraws\r\ninto the ball of a thermometer.\r\n\r\n--You don't suppose that my remarks made at this table are like so many\r\npostage-stamps, do you,--each to be only once uttered? If you do, you are\r\nmistaken. He must be a poor creature that does not often repeat himself.\r\nImagine the author of the excellent piece of advice, \"Know thyself,\"\r\nnever alluding to that sentiment again during the course of a protracted\r\nexistence! Why, the truths a man carries about with him are his tools; and\r\ndo you think a carpenter is bound to use the same plane but once to smooth\r\na knotty board with, or to hang up his hammer after it has driven its first\r\nnail? I shall never repeat a conversation, but an idea often. I shall\r\nuse the same types when I like, but not commonly the same stereotypes. A\r\nthought is often original, though you have uttered it a hundred times.\r\nIt has come to you over a new route, by a new and express train of\r\nassociations.\r\n\r\nSometimes, but rarely, one may be caught making the same speech twice over,\r\nand yet be held blameless. Thus, a certain lecturer, after performing in\r\nan inland city, where dwells a _Littératrice_ of note, was invited to meet\r\nher and others over the social teacup. She pleasantly referred to his many\r\nwanderings in his new occupation. \"Yes,\" he replied, \"I am like the Huma,\r\nthe bird that never lights, being always in the ears, as he is always on\r\nthe wing,\"--Years elapsed. The lecturer visited the same place once more\r\nfor the same purpose. Another social cup after the lecture, and a second\r\nmeeting with the distinguished lady. \"You are constantly going from place\r\nto place,\" she said.--\"Yes,\" he answered, \"I am like the Huma,\"--and\r\nfinished the sentence as before.\r\n\r\nWhat horrors, when it flashed over him that he had made this fine speech,\r\nword for word, twice over! Yet it was not true, as the lady might perhaps\r\nhave fairly inferred, that he had embellished his conversation with the\r\nHuma daily during that whole interval of years. On the contrary, he had\r\nnever once thought of the odious fowl until the recurrence of precisely\r\nthe same circumstances brought up precisely the same idea. He ought to\r\nhave been proud of the accuracy of his mental adjustments. Given certain\r\nfactors, and a sound brain should always evolve the same fixed product with\r\nthe certainty of Babbage's calculating machine.\r\n\r\n--What a satire, by the way, is that machine on the mere mathematician! A\r\nFrankenstein-monster, a thing without brains and without heart, too stupid\r\nto make a blunder; that turns out formulæ like a corn-sheller, and never\r\ngrows any wiser or better, though it grind a thousand bushels of them!\r\n\r\nI have an immense respect for a man of talents _plus_ \"the mathematics.\"\r\nBut the calculating power alone should seem to be the least human of\r\nqualities, and to have the smallest amount of reason in it; since a machine\r\ncan be made to do the work of three or four calculators, and better than\r\nany one of them. Sometimes I have been troubled that I had not a deeper\r\nintuitive apprehension of the relations of numbers. But the triumph of the\r\nciphering hand-organ has consoled me. I always fancy I can hear the wheels\r\nclicking in a calculator's brain. The power of dealing with numbers is a\r\nkind of \"detached lever\" arrangement, which may be put into a mighty poor\r\nwatch. I suppose it is about as common as the power of moving the ears\r\nvoluntarily, which is a moderately rare endowment.\r\n\r\n--Little localized powers, and little narrow streaks of specialized\r\nknowledge, are things men are very apt to be conceited about. Nature is\r\nvery wise; but for this encouraging principle how many small talents and\r\nlittle accomplishments would be neglected! Talk about conceit as much as\r\nyou like, it is to human character what salt is to the ocean; it keeps it\r\nsweet, and renders it endurable. Say rather it is like the natural unguent\r\nof the sea-fowl's plumage, which enables him to shed the rain that falls on\r\nhim and the wave in which he dips. When one has had _all_ his conceit taken\r\nout of him, when he has lost _all_ his illusions, his feathers will soon\r\nsoak through, and he will fly no more.\r\n\r\nSo you admire conceited people, do you? said the young lady who has come to\r\nthe city to be finished off for--the duties of life.\r\n\r\nI am afraid you do not study logic at your school, my dear. It does not\r\nfollow that I wish to be pickled in brine because I like a saltwater plunge\r\nat Nahant. I say that conceit is just as natural a thing to human minds as\r\na centre is to a circle. But little-minded people's thoughts move in such\r\nsmall circles that five minutes' conversation gives you an arc long enough\r\nto determine their whole curve. An arc in the movement of a large intellect\r\ndoes not sensibly differ from a straight line. Even if it have the third\r\nvowel as its centre, it does not soon betray it. The highest thought, that\r\nis, is the most seemingly impersonal; it does not obviously imply any\r\nindividual centre.\r\n\r\nAudacious self-esteem, with good ground for it, is always imposing. What\r\nresplendent beauty that must have been which could have authorized Phryne\r\nto \"peel\" in the way she did! What fine speeches are those two: \"_Non omnis\r\nmoriar_\" and \"I have taken all knowledge to be my province\"! Even in common\r\npeople, conceit has the virtue of making them cheerful; the man who thinks\r\nhis wife, his baby, his house, his horse, his dog, and himself severally\r\nunequalled, is almost sure to be a good-humored person, though liable to be\r\ntedious at times.\r\n\r\n--What are the great faults of conversation? Want of ideas, want of words,\r\nwant of manners, are the principal ones, I suppose you think. I don't\r\ndoubt it, but I will tell you what I have found spoil more good talks than\r\nanything else;--long arguments on special points between people who differ\r\non the fundamental principles upon which these points depend. No men can\r\nhave satisfactory relations with each other until they have agreed on\r\ncertain _ultimata_ of belief not to be disturbed in ordinary conversation,\r\nand unless they have sense enough to trace the secondary questions\r\ndepending upon these ultimate beliefs to their source. In short, just as a\r\nwritten constitution is essential to the best social order, so a code of\r\nfinalities is a necessary condition of profitable talk between two persons.\r\nTalking is like playing on the harp; there is as much in laying the hand on\r\nthe strings to stop their vibrations as in twanging them to bring out their\r\nmusic.\r\n\r\n--Do you mean to say the pun-question is not clearly settled in your minds?\r\nLet me lay down the law upon the subject. Life and language are alike\r\nsacred. Homicide and _verbicide_--that is, violent treatment of a word\r\nwith fatal results to its legitimate meaning, which is its life--are alike\r\nforbidden. Manslaughter, which is the meaning of the one, is the same as\r\nman's laughter, which is the end of the other. A pun is _primâ facie_ an\r\ninsult to the person you are talking with. It implies utter indifference\r\nto or sublime contempt for his remarks, no matter how serious. I speak of\r\ntotal depravity, and one says all that is written on the subject is deep\r\nraving. I have committed my self-respect by talking with such a person. I\r\nshould like to commit him, but cannot, because he is a nuisance. Or I speak\r\nof geological convulsions, and he asks me what was the cosine of Noah's\r\nark; also, whether the Deluge was not a deal huger than any modern\r\ninundation.\r\n\r\nA pun does not commonly justify a blow in return. But if a blow were given\r\nfor such cause, and death ensued, the jury would be judges both of the\r\nfacts and of the pun, and might, if the latter were of an aggravated\r\ncharacter, return a verdict of justifiable homicide. Thus, in a case lately\r\ndecided before Miller, J., Doe presented Roe a subscription paper, and\r\nurged the claims of suffering humanity. Roe replied by asking, When charity\r\nwas like a top? It was in evidence that Doe preserved a dignified silence.\r\nRoe then said, \"When it begins to hum.\" Doe then--and not till then--struck\r\nRoe, and his head happening to strike a bound volume of the Monthly Rag-bag\r\nand Stolen Miscellany, intense mortification ensued, with a fatal result.\r\nThe chief laid down his notions of the law to his brother justices, who\r\nunanimously replied, \"Jest so.\" The chief rejoined, that no man should jest\r\nso without being punished for it, and charged for the prisoner, who was\r\nacquitted, and the pun ordered to be burned by the sheriff. The bound\r\nvolume was forfeited as a deodand, but not claimed.\r\n\r\nPeople that make puns are like wanton boys that put coppers on the railroad\r\ntracks. They amuse themselves and other children, but their little trick\r\nmay upset a freight train of conversation for the sake of a battered\r\nwitticism.\r\n\r\nI will thank you, B.F., to bring down two books, of which I will mark the\r\nplaces on this slip of paper. (While he is gone, I may say that this boy,\r\nour landlady's youngest, is called BENJAMIN FRANKLIN, after the celebrated\r\nphilosopher of that name. A highly merited compliment.)\r\n\r\nI wished to refer to two eminent authorities. Now be so good as to listen.\r\nThe great moralist says: \"To trifle with the vocabulary which is the\r\nvehicle of social intercourse is to tamper with the currency of human\r\nintelligence. He who would violate the sanctities of his mother tongue\r\nwould invade the recesses of the paternal till without remorse, and repeat\r\nthe banquet of Saturn without an indigestion.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, once more, listen to the historian. \"The Puritans hated puns. The\r\nBishops were notoriously addicted to them. The Lords Temporal carried them\r\nto the verge of license. Majesty itself must have its Royal quibble. 'Ye be\r\nburly, my Lord of Burleigh,' said Queen Elizabeth, 'but ye shall make less\r\nstir in our realm than my Lord of Leicester.' The gravest wisdom and the\r\nhighest breeding lent their sanction to the practice. Lord Bacon playfully\r\ndeclared himself a descendant of 'Og, the King of Bashan. Sir Philip\r\nSidney, with his last breath, reproached the soldier who brought him water,\r\nfor wasting a casque full upon a dying man. A courtier, who saw Othello\r\nperformed at the Globe Theatre, remarked, that the blackamoor was a brute,\r\nand not a man. 'Thou hast reason,' replied a great Lord, 'according to\r\nPlato his saying; for this be a two-legged animal _with_ feathers.' The\r\nfatal habit became universal. The language was corrupted. The infection\r\nspread to the national conscience. Political double-dealings naturally grew\r\nout of verbal double meanings. The teeth of the new dragon were sown by the\r\nCadmus who introduced the alphabet of equivocation. What was levity in\r\nthe time of the Tudors grew to regicide and revolution in the age of the\r\nStuarts.\"\r\n\r\nWho was that boarder that just whispered something about the\r\nMacaulay-flowers of literature?--There was a dead silence.--I said calmly,\r\nI shall henceforth consider any interruption by a pun as a hint to change\r\nmy boarding-house. Do not plead my example. If _I_ have used any such, it\r\nhas been only as a Spartan father would show up a drunken helot. We have\r\ndone with them.\r\n\r\n--If a logical mind ever found out anything with its logic?--I should say\r\nthat its most frequent work was to build a _pons asinorum_ over chasms that\r\nshrewd people can bestride without such a structure. You can hire logic, in\r\nthe shape of a lawyer, to prove anything that you want to prove. You can\r\nbuy treatises to show that Napoleon never lived, and that no battle of\r\nBunker-hill was ever fought. The great minds are those with a wide span,\r\nthat couple truths related to, but far removed from, each other. Logicians\r\ncarry the surveyor's chain over the track of which these are the true\r\nexplorers. I value a man mainly for his primary relations with truth, as I\r\nunderstand truth,--not for any secondary artifice in handling his ideas.\r\nSome of the sharpest men in argument are notoriously unsound in judgment.\r\nI should not trust the counsel of a smart debater, any more than that of a\r\ngood chess-player. Either may of course advise wisely, but not necessarily\r\nbecause he wrangles or plays well.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman who sits opposite got his hand up, as a pointer lifts\r\nhis forefoot, at the expression, \"his relations with truth as I understand\r\ntruth,\" and when I had done, sniffed audibly, and said I talked like a\r\ntranscendentalist. For his part, common sense was good enough for him.\r\n\r\nPrecisely so, my dear sir, I replied; common sense, _as you understand it_.\r\nWe all have to assume a standard of judgment in our own minds, either of\r\nthings or persons. A man who is willing to take another's opinion has to\r\nexercise his judgment in the choice of whom to follow, which is often as\r\nnice a matter as to judge of things for one's self. On the whole, I had\r\nrather judge men's minds by comparing their thoughts with my own, than\r\njudge of thoughts by knowing who utter them. I must do one or the other. It\r\ndoes not follow, of course, that I may not recognize another man's thoughts\r\nas broader and deeper than my own; but that does not necessarily change my\r\nopinion, otherwise this would be at the mercy of every superior mind that\r\nheld a different one. How many of our most cherished beliefs are like those\r\ndrinking-glasses of the ancient pattern, that serve us well so long as we\r\nkeep them in our hand, but spill all if we attempt to set them down! I have\r\nsometimes compared conversation to the Italian game of _mora_, in which one\r\nplayer lifts his hand with so many fingers extended, and the other matches\r\nor misses the number, as the case may be with his own. I show my thought,\r\nanother his; if they agree, well; if they differ, we find the largest\r\ncommon factor, if we can, but at any rate avoid disputing about remainders\r\nand fractions, which is to real talk what tuning an instrument is to\r\nplaying on it.\r\n\r\n--What if, instead of talking this morning, I should read you a copy of\r\nverses, with critical remarks by the author? Any of the company can retire\r\nthat like.\r\n\r\n  When Eve had led her lord away,\r\n    And Cain had killed his brother,\r\n  The stars and flowers, the poets say,\r\n    Agreed with one another\r\n\r\n  To cheat the cunning tempter's art,\r\n    And teach the race its duty,\r\n  By keeping on its wicked heart\r\n    Their eyes of light and beauty.\r\n\r\n  A million sleepless lids, they say,\r\n    Will be at least a warning;\r\n  And so the flowers would watch by day,\r\n    The stars from eve to morning.\r\n\r\n  On hill and prairie, field and lawn,\r\n    Their dewy eyes upturning,\r\n  The flowers still watch from reddening dawn\r\n    Till western skies are burning.\r\n\r\n  Alas! each hour of daylight tells\r\n    A tale of shame so crushing,\r\n  That some turn white as sea-bleached shells,\r\n    And some are always blushing.\r\n\r\n  But when the patient stars look down\r\n    On all their light discovers,\r\n  The traitor's smile, the murderer's frown,\r\n    The lips of lying lovers,\r\n\r\n  They try to shut their saddening eyes,\r\n    And in the vain endeavour\r\n  We see them twinkling in the skies,\r\n    And so they wink forever.\r\n\r\nWhat do _you_ think of these verses, my friends? Is that piece an\r\nimpromptu? said my landlady's daughter. (Aet. 19+. Tender-eyed blonde. Long\r\nringlets. Cameo pin. Gold pencil-case on a chain. Locket. Bracelet. Album.\r\nAutograph book. Accordeon. Reads Byron, Tupper, and Sylvanus Cobb, junior,\r\nwhile her mother makes the puddings. Says, \"Yes?\" when you tell her\r\nanything.)--_Oui et non, ma petite_,--Yes and no, my child. Five of the\r\nseven verses were written off-hand; the other two took a week,--that is,\r\nwere hanging round the desk in a ragged, forlorn, unrhymed condition as\r\nlong as that. All poets will tell you just such stories. _C'est le DERNIER\r\npas qui coute_. Don't you know how hard it is for some people to get out of\r\na room after their visit is really over? They want to be off, and you want\r\nto have them off, but they don't know how to manage it. One would think\r\nthey had been built in your parlour or study, and were waiting to be\r\nlaunched. I have contrived a sort of ceremonial inclined plane for such\r\nvisitors, which being lubricated with certain smooth phrases, I back them\r\ndown, metaphorically speaking, stern-foremost, into their \"native element,\"\r\nthe great ocean of out-doors. Well, now, there are poems as hard to get rid\r\nof as these rural visitors. They come in glibly, use up all the serviceable\r\nrhymes, _day_, _ray_, _beauty_, _duty_, _skies_, _eyes_, _other_,\r\n_brother_, _mountain_, _fountain_, and the like; and so they go on until\r\nyou think it is time for the wind-up, and the wind-up won't come on any\r\nterms. So they lie about until you get sick of the sight of them, and end\r\nby thrusting some cold scrap of a final couplet upon them, and turning them\r\nout of doors. I suspect a good many \"impromptus\" could tell just such a\r\nstory as the above.--Here turning to our landlady, I used an illustration\r\nwhich pleased the company much at the time, and has since been highly\r\ncommended. \"Madam,\" I said, \"you can pour three gills and three quarters\r\nof honey from that pint jug, if it is full, in less than one minute; but,\r\nMadam, you could not empty that last quarter of a gill, though you were\r\nturned into a marble Hebe, and held the vessel upside down for a thousand\r\nyears.\"\r\n\r\nOne gets tired to death of the old, old rhymes, such as you see in that\r\ncopy of verses,--which I don't mean to abuse, or to praise either. I always\r\nfeel as if I were a cobbler, putting new top-leathers to an old pair of\r\nboot-soles and bodies, when I am fitting sentiments to these venerable\r\njingles.\r\n\r\n     *     *     *     *    youth\r\n     *     *     *     *   morning\r\n     *     *     *     *    truth\r\n     *     *     *     *   warning\r\n\r\nNine tenths of the \"Juvenile Poems\" written spring out of the above musical\r\nand suggestive coincidences.\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\" said our landlady's daughter.\r\n\r\nI did not address the following remark to her, and I trust, from her\r\nlimited range of reading, she will never see it; I said it softly to my\r\nnext neighbour.\r\n\r\nWhen a young female wears a flat circular side-curl, gummed on each\r\ntemple,--when she walks with a male, not arm in arm, but his arm against\r\nthe back of hers,--and when she says \"Yes?\" with the note of interrogation,\r\nyou are generally safe in asking her what wages she gets, and who the\r\n\"feller\" was you saw her with.\r\n\r\n\"What were you whispering?\" said the daughter of the house, moistening her\r\nlips, as she spoke, in a very engaging manner.\r\n\r\n\"I was only giving some hints on the fine arts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes?\"\r\n\r\n--It is curious to see how the same wants and tastes find the same\r\nimplements and modes of expression in all times and places. The young\r\nladies of Otaheite, as you may see in Cook's Voyages, had a sort of\r\ncrinoline arrangement fully equal in radius to the largest spread of our\r\nown lady-baskets. When I fling a Bay-State shawl over my shoulders, I am\r\nonly taking a lesson from the climate that the Indian had learned before\r\nme. A _blanket_-shawl we call it, and not a plaid; and we wear it like the\r\naborigines, and not like the Highlanders.\r\n\r\n--We are the Romans of the modern world,--the great assimilating people.\r\nConflicts and conquests are of course necessary accidents with us, as with\r\nour prototypes. And so we come to their style of weapon. Our army sword\r\nis the short, stiff, pointed _gladius_ of the Romans; and the American\r\nbowie-knife is the same tool, modified to meet the daily wants of civil\r\nsociety. I announce at this table an axiom not to be found in Montesquieu\r\nor the journals of Congress:--\r\n\r\nThe race that shortens its weapons lengthens its boundaries.\r\n\r\n_Corollary_. It was the Polish _lance_ that left Poland at last with\r\nnothing of her own to bound.\r\n\r\n  \"Dropped from her nerveless grasp the _shattered spear_!\"\r\n\r\nWhat business had Sarmatia to be fighting for liberty with a fifteen-foot\r\npole between her and the breasts of her enemies? If she had but clutched\r\nthe old Roman and young American weapon, and come to close quarters, there\r\nmight have been a chance for her; but it would have spoiled the best\r\npassage in \"The Pleasures of Hope.\"\r\n\r\n--Self-made men?--Well, yes. Of course every body likes and respects\r\nself-made men. It is a great deal better to be made in that way than not to\r\nbe made at all. Are any of you younger people old enough to remember that\r\nIrishman's house on the marsh at Cambridgeport, which house he built from\r\ndrain to chimney-top with his own hands? It took him a good many years to\r\nbuild it, and one could see that it was a little out of plumb, and a little\r\nwavy in outline, and a little queer and uncertain in general aspect. A\r\nregular hand could certainly have built a better house; but it was a very\r\ngood house for a \"self-made\" carpenter's house, and people praised it, and\r\nsaid how remarkably well the Irishman had succeeded. They never thought of\r\npraising the fine blocks of houses a little farther on.\r\n\r\nYour self-made man, whittled into shape with his own jack-knife, deserves\r\nmore credit, if that is all, than the regular engine-turned article, shaped\r\nby the most approved pattern, and French-polished by society and travel.\r\nBut as to saying that one is every way the equal of the other, that is\r\nanother matter. The right of strict social discrimination of all things and\r\npersons, according to their merits, native or acquired, is one of the most\r\nprecious republican privileges. I take the liberty to exercise it, when I\r\nsay, that, _other things being equal_, in most relations of life I prefer a\r\nman of family.\r\n\r\nWhat do I mean by a man of family?--O, I'll give you a general idea of what\r\nI mean. Let us give him a first-rate fit out; it costs us nothing.\r\n\r\nFour or five generations of gentlemen and gentlewomen; among them a member\r\nof his Majesty's Council for the Province, a Governor or so, one or two\r\nDoctors of Divinity, a member of Congress, not later than the time of\r\ntop-boots with tassels.\r\n\r\nFamily portraits. The member of the Council, by Smibert. The great\r\nmerchant-uncle, by Copley, full length, sitting in his arm-chair, in a\r\nvelvet cap and flowered robe, with a globe by him, to show the range of his\r\ncommercial transactions, and letters with large red seals lying round, one\r\ndirected conspicuously to The Honourable etc. etc. Great-grandmother, by\r\nthe same artist; brown satin, lace very fine, hands superlative; grand old\r\nlady, stiffish, but imposing. Her mother, artist unknown; flat, angular,\r\nhanging sleeves; parrot on fist. A pair of Stuarts, viz., 1. A superb\r\nfull-blown, mediæval gentleman, with a fiery dash of Tory blood in his\r\nveins, tempered down with that of a fine old rebel grandmother, and warmed\r\nup with the best of old India Madeira; his face is one flame of ruddy\r\nsunshine; his ruffled shirt rushes out of his bosom with an impetuous\r\ngenerosity, as if it would drag his heart after it; and his smile is good\r\nfor twenty thousand dollars to the Hospital, besides ample bequests to\r\nall relatives and dependants. 2. Lady of the same; remarkable cap; high\r\nwaist, as in time of Empire; bust _à la Josephine_; wisps of curls,\r\nlike celery-tips, at sides of forehead; complexion clear and warm, like\r\nrose-cordial. As for the miniatures by Malbone, we don't count them in the\r\ngallery.\r\n\r\nBooks, too, with the names of old college-students in them,--family\r\nnames:--you will find them at the head of their respective classes in\r\nthe days when students took rank on the catalogue from their parents'\r\ncondition. Elzevirs, with the Latinized appellations of youthful\r\nprogenitors, and _Hic liber est meus_ on the title-page. A set of Hogarth's\r\noriginal plates. Pope, original edition, 15 volumes, London, 1717. Barrow\r\non the lower shelves, in folio. Tillotson on the upper, in a little dark\r\nplatoon of octodecimos.\r\n\r\nSome family silver; a string of wedding and funeral rings; the arms of the\r\nfamily curiously blazoned; the same in worsted, by a maiden aunt.\r\n\r\nIf the man of family has an old place to keep these things in, furnished\r\nwith claw-foot chairs and black mahogany tables, and tall bevel-edged\r\nmirrors, and stately upright cabinets, his outfit is complete.\r\n\r\nNo, my friends, I go (always, other things being equal) for the man that\r\ninherits family traditions and the cumulative humanities of at least four\r\nor five generations. Above all things, as a child, he should have tumbled\r\nabout in a library. All men are afraid of books, that have not handled them\r\nfrom infancy. Do you suppose our dear Professor over there ever read _Poll\r\nSynopsis_, or consulted _Castelli Lexicon_, while he was growing up to\r\ntheir stature? Not he; but virtue passed through the hem of their parchment\r\nand leather garments whenever he touched them, as the precious drugs\r\nsweated through the bat's handle in the Arabian story. I tell you he is at\r\nhome wherever he smells the invigorating fragrance of Russia leather. No\r\nself-made man feels so. One may, it is true, have all the antecedents I\r\nhave spoken of, and yet be a boor or a shabby fellow. One may have none of\r\nthem, and yet be fit for councils and courts. Then let them change places.\r\nOur social arrangement has this great beauty, that its strata shift up and\r\ndown as they change specific gravity, without being clogged by layers of\r\nprescription. But I still insist on my democratic liberty of choice, and I\r\ngo for the man with the gallery of family portraits against the one with\r\nthe twenty-five-cent daguerreotype, unless I find out that the last is the\r\nbetter of the two.\r\n\r\n--I should have felt more nervous about the late comet, if I had thought\r\nthe world was ripe. But it is very green yet, if I am not mistaken; and\r\nbesides, there is a great deal of coal to use up, which I cannot bring\r\nmyself to think was made for nothing. If certain things, which seem to me\r\nessential to a millennium, had come to pass, I should have been frightened;\r\nbut they haven't. Perhaps you would like to hear my\r\n\r\nLATTER-DAY WARNINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  When legislators keep the law,\r\n  When banks dispense with bolts and locks,\r\n  When berries, whortle--rasp--and straw--\r\n  Grow bigger _downwards_ through the box,--\r\n\r\n  When he that selleth house or land\r\n  Shows leak in roof or flaw in right,--\r\n  When haberdashers choose the stand\r\n  Whose window hath the broadest light,--\r\n\r\n  When preachers tell us all they think,\r\n  And party leaders all they mean,--\r\n  When what we pay for, that we drink,\r\n  From real grape and coffee-bean,--\r\n\r\n  When lawyers take what they would give,\r\n  And doctors give what they would take,--\r\n  When city fathers eat to live,\r\n  Save when they fast for conscience' sake,--\r\n\r\n  When one that hath a horse on sale\r\n  Shall bring his merit to the proof,\r\n  Without a lie for every nail\r\n  That holds the iron on the hoof,--\r\n\r\n  When in the usual place for rips\r\n  Our gloves are stitched with special care,\r\n  And guarded well the whalebone tips\r\n  Where first umbrellas need repair,--\r\n\r\n  When Cuba's weeds have quite forgot\r\n  The power of suction to resist,\r\n  And claret-bottles harbor not\r\n  Such dimples as would hold your fist,--\r\n\r\n  When publishers no longer steal,\r\n  And pay for what they stole before,--\r\n  When the first locomotive's wheel\r\n  Rolls through the Hoosac tunnel's bore;--\r\n\r\n  _Till_ then let Gumming blaze away,\r\n  And Miller's saints blow up the globe;\r\n  But when you see that blessed day,\r\n  _Then_ order your ascension robe!\r\n\r\nThe company seemed to like the verses, and I promised them to read others\r\noccasionally, if they had a mind to hear them. Of course they would not\r\nexpect it every morning. Neither must the reader suppose that all these\r\nthings I have reported were said at any one breakfast-time. I have not\r\ntaken the trouble to date them, as Raspail, _père_, used to date every\r\nproof he sent to the printer; but they were scattered over several\r\nbreakfasts; and I have said a good many more things since, which I shall\r\nvery possibly print some time or other, if I am urged to do it by judicious\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, in company with an agreeable party, I spent a long summer\r\nday in exploring the Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. We traversed, through\r\nspacious galleries affording a solid masonry foundation for the town and\r\ncounty overhead, the six or eight black miles from the mouth of the cavern\r\nto the innermost recess which tourists visit,--a niche or grotto made of\r\none seamless stalactite, and called, I believe, Serena's Bower. I lost the\r\nlight of one day. I saw high domes, and bottomless pits; heard the voice of\r\nunseen waterfalls; paddled three quarters of a mile in the deep Echo River,\r\nwhose waters are peopled with the blind fish; crossed the streams \"Lethe\"\r\nand \"Styx\"; plied with music and guns the echoes in these alarming\r\ngalleries; saw every form of stalagmite and stalactite in the sculptured\r\nand fretted chambers,--the icicle, the orange-flower, the acanthus, the\r\ngrapes, and the snowball. We shot Bengal lights into the vaults and groins\r\nof the sparry cathedrals, and examined all the masterpieces which the four\r\ncombined engineers, water, limestone, gravitation, and time, could make in\r\nthe dark.\r\n\r\nThe sights and scenery of the cave had the same dignity that belongs to all\r\nnatural objects, and which shames the fine things to which we foppishly\r\ncompare them. I remarked, especially, the mimetic habit, with which Nature,\r\non new instruments, hums her old tunes, making night to mimic day, and\r\nchemistry to ape vegetation. But I then took notice, and still chiefly\r\nremember, that the best thing which the cave had to offer was an illusion.\r\nOn arriving at what is called the \"Star-Chamber,\" our lamps were taken from\r\nus by the guide, and extinguished or put aside, and, on looking upwards, I\r\nsaw or seemed to see the night heaven thick with stars glimmering more or\r\nless brightly over our heads, and even what seemed a comet flaming among\r\nthem. All the party were touched with astonishment and pleasure. Our\r\nmusical friends sung with much feeling a pretty song, \"The stars are in\r\nthe quiet sky,\" &c., and I sat down on the rocky door to enjoy the serene\r\npicture. Some crystal specks in the black ceiling high overhead, reflecting\r\nthe light of a half-hid lamp, yielded this magnificent effect.\r\n\r\nI own, I did not like the cave so well for eking out its sublimities with\r\nthis theatrical trick. But I have had many experiences like it, before and\r\nsince; and we must be content to be pleased without too curiously analyzing\r\nthe occasions. Our conversation with Nature is not just what it seems. The\r\ncloud-rack, the sunrise and sunset glories, rainbows, and northern lights\r\nare not quite so spheral as our childhood thought them; and the part our\r\norganization plays in them is too large. The senses interfere everywhere,\r\nand mix their own structure with all they report of. Once, we fancied the\r\nearth a plane, and stationary. In admiring the sunset, we do not yet deduct\r\nthe rounding, coordinating, pictorial powers of the eye.\r\n\r\nThe same interference from our organization creates the most of our\r\npleasure and pain. Our first mistake is the belief that the circumstance\r\ngives the joy which we give to the circumstance. Life is an ecstasy. Life\r\nis sweet as nitrous oxide; and the fisherman dripping all day over a cold\r\npond, the switchman at the railway intersection, the farmer in the field,\r\nthe Irishman in the ditch, the fop in the street, the hunter in the woods,\r\nthe barrister with the jury, the belle at the ball, all ascribe a certain\r\npleasure to their employment, which they themselves give it. Health and\r\nappetite impart the sweetness to sugar, bread, and meat. We fancy that\r\nour civilization has got on far, but we still come back to our primers.\r\nThackeray's \"Vanity Fair\" is pathetic in its name, and in his use of the\r\nname. It is an admission from a man of the world in the London of 1850,\r\nthat poor old Puritan Bunyan was right in his perception of the London of\r\n1650. And yet now, in Thackeray, is the added wisdom or skepticism, that\r\nthough this be really so, he must yet live in tolerance of and practically\r\nin homage and obedience to these illusions.\r\n\r\nThe world rolls, the din of life is never hushed. In London, in Paris, in\r\nBoston, in San Francisco, the carnival, the masquerade is at its height.\r\nNobody drops his domino. The unities, the fictions of the piece it would be\r\nan impertinence to break. The chapter of fascinations is very long. Great\r\nis paint; nay, God is the painter; and we rightly accuse the critic who\r\ndestroys too many illusions. Society does not love its unmaskers. It was\r\nwittily, if somewhat bitterly, said by D'Alembert, \"_Un état de vapeur\r\nétait un état très fâcheux, parcequ'il nous faisait voir les choses\r\ncomme elles sont._\" I find men victims of illusion in all parts of life.\r\nChildren, youths, adults, and old men, all are led by one bawble or\r\nanother. Yoganidra, the goddess of illusion, Proteus, or Momus, or Gylfi's\r\nMocking,--for the Power has many names,--is stronger than the Titans,\r\nstronger than Apollo. The toys, to be sure, are various, and are graduated\r\nin refinement to the quality of the dupe. The intellectual man requires a\r\nfine bait; the sots are easily amused. But everybody is drugged with his\r\nown dream, and the pageant marches at all hours, with music and banner and\r\nbadge.\r\n\r\nAmid the joyous troop who give in to the charivari, comes now and then\r\na sad-eyed boy, whose eyes lack the requisite refractions to clothe the\r\nshow in due glory, and who is afflicted with a tendency to trace home the\r\nglittering miscellany of fruits and flowers to one root. Science is a\r\nsearch after identity, and the scientific whim is lurking in all corners.\r\nAt the State Fair, a friend of mine complained that all the varieties of\r\nfancy pears in our orchards seem to have been selected by somebody who had\r\na whim for a particular kind of pear, and only cultivated such as had that\r\nperfume; they were all alike. And I remember the quarrel of another youth\r\nwith the confectioners, that, when he racked his wit to choose the best\r\ncomfits in the shops, in all the endless varieties of sweetmeat he could\r\nonly find three flavors, or two. What then? Pears and cakes are good for\r\nsomething; and because you, unluckily, have an eye or nose too keen, why\r\nneed you spoil the comfort which the rest of us find in them? I knew a\r\nhumorist, who, in a good deal of rattle, had a grain or two of sense.\r\nHe shocked the company by maintaining that the attributes of God were\r\ntwo,--power and risibility; and that it was the duty of every pious man\r\nto keep up the comedy. And I have known gentlemen of great stake in the\r\ncommunity, but whose sympathies were cold,--presidents of colleges,\r\nand governors, and senators,--who held themselves bound to sign every\r\ntemperance pledge, and act with Bible societies, and missions, and\r\npeacemakers, and cry _Hist-a-boy!_ to every good dog. We must not carry\r\ncomity too far, but we all have kind impulses in this direction. When the\r\nboys come into my yard for leave to gather horsechestnuts, I own I enter\r\ninto Nature's game, and affect to grant the permission reluctantly, fearing\r\nthat any moment they will find out the imposture of that showy chaff. But\r\nthis tenderness is quite unnecessary; the enchantments are laid on very\r\nthick. Their young life is thatched with them. Bare and grim to tears is\r\nthe lot of the children in the hovel I saw yesterday; yet not the less they\r\nhung it round with frippery romance, like the children of the happiest\r\nfortune, and talked of \"the dear cottage where so many joyful hours had\r\nflown.\" Well, this thatching of hovels is the custom of the country. Women,\r\nmore than all, are the element and kingdom of illusion. Being fascinated,\r\nthey fascinate others. They see through Claud-Lorraines. And how dare\r\nany one, if he could, pluck away the _coulisses_, stage effects, and\r\nceremonies, by which they live? Too pathetic, too pitiable, is the region\r\nof affection, and its atmosphere always liable to _mirage_.\r\n\r\nWe are not very much to blame for our bad marriages. We live amid\r\nhallucinations; and this especial trap is laid to trip up our feet with,\r\nand all are tripped up first or last. But the mighty Mother who had been\r\nso sly with us, as if she felt that she owed us some indemnity, insinuates\r\ninto the Pandora-box of marriage some deep and serious benefits, and some\r\ngreat joys. We find a delight in the beauty and happiness of children, that\r\nmakes the heart too big for the body. In the worst-assorted connections\r\nthere is ever some mixture of true marriage. Teague and his jade get some\r\njust relations of mutual respect, kindly observation, and fostering of each\r\nother, learn something, and would carry themselves wiselier, if they were\r\nnow to begin.\r\n\r\n'Tis fine for us to point at one or another fine madman, as if there were\r\nany exempts. The scholar in his library is none. I, who have all my life\r\nheard any number of orations and debates, read poems and miscellaneous\r\nbooks, conversed with many geniuses, am still the victim of any new page;\r\nand, if Marmaduke, or Hugh, or Moosehead, or any other, invent a new style\r\nor mythology, I fancy that the world will be all brave and right, if\r\ndressed in these colors, which I had not thought of. Then at once I will\r\ndaub with this new paint; but it will not stick. 'Tis like the cement which\r\nthe peddler sells at the door; he makes broken crockery hold with it, but\r\nyou can never buy of him a bit of the cement which will make it hold when\r\nhe is gone.\r\n\r\nMen who make themselves felt in the world avail themselves of a certain\r\nfate in their constitution, which they know how to use. But they never\r\ndeeply interest us, unless they lift a corner of the curtain, or betray\r\nnever so slightly their penetration of what is behind it. 'Tis the charm\r\nof practical men, that outside of their practicality are a certain poetry\r\nand play, as if they led the good horse Power by the bridle, and preferred\r\nto walk, though they can ride so fiercely. Bonaparte is intellectual, as\r\nwell as Cæsar; and the best soldiers, sea-captains, and railway men have\r\na gentleness, when off duty; a good-natured admission that there are\r\nillusions, and who shall say that he is not their sport? We stigmatize the\r\ncast-iron fellows, who cannot so detach themselves, as \"dragon-ridden,\"\r\n\"thunder-stricken,\" and fools of fate, with whatever powers endowed.\r\n\r\nSince our tuition is through emblems and indirections, 'tis well to know\r\nthat there is method in it, a fixed scale, and rank above rank in the\r\nphantasms. We begin low with coarse masks, and rise to the most subtle and\r\nbeautiful. The red men told Columbus, \"they had an herb which took away\r\nfatigue\"; but he found the illusion of \"arriving from the east at the\r\nIndies\" more composing to his lofty spirit than any tobacco. Is not our\r\nfaith in the impenetrability of matter more sedative than narcotics? You\r\nplay with jackstraws, balls, bowls, horse and gun, estates and politics;\r\nbut there are finer games before you. Is not time a pretty toy? Life will\r\nshow you masks that are worth all your carnivals. Yonder mountain must\r\nmigrate into your mind. The fine star-dust and nebulous blur in Orion, \"the\r\nportentous year of Mizar and Alcor,\" must come down and be dealt with in\r\nyour household thought. What if you shall come to discern that the play and\r\nplayground of all this pompous history are radiations from yourself, and\r\nthat the sun borrows his beams? What terrible questions we are learning to\r\nask! The former men believed in magic, by which temples, cities, and men\r\nwere swallowed up, and all trace of them gone. We are coming on the secret\r\nof a magic which sweeps out of men's minds all vestige of theism and\r\nbeliefs which they and their fathers held and were framed upon.\r\n\r\nWith such volatile elements to work in, 'tis no wonder if our estimates\r\nare loose and floating. We must work and affirm, but we have no guess of\r\nthe value of what we say or do. The cloud is now as big as your hand,\r\nand now it covers a county. That story of Thor, who was set to drain the\r\ndrinking-horn in Asgard, and to wrestle with the old woman, and to run\r\nwith the runner Lok, and presently found that he had been drinking up the\r\nsea, and wrestling with Time, and racing with Thought, describes us who\r\nare contending, amid these seeming trifles, with the supreme energies of\r\nNature. We fancy we have fallen into bad company and squalid condition, low\r\ndebts, shoe-bills, broken glass to pay for, pots to buy, butcher's meat,\r\nsugar, milk, and coal. \"Set me some great task, ye gods! and I will show\r\nmy spirit.\" \"Not so,\" says the good Heaven; \"plod and plough, vamp your\r\nold coats and hats, weave a shoestring; great affairs and the best wine\r\nby and by.\" Well, 'tis all phantasm; and if we weave a yard of tape in\r\nall humility and as well as we can, long hereafter we shall see it was no\r\ncotton tape at all, but some galaxy which we braided, and that the threads\r\nwere Time and Nature.\r\n\r\nWe cannot write the order of the variable winds. How can we penetrate the\r\nlaw of our shifting moods and susceptibility? Yet they differ as all and\r\nnothing. Instead of the firmament of yesterday, which our eyes require, it\r\nis to-day an eggshell which coops us in; we cannot even see what or where\r\nour stars of destiny are. From day to day, the capital facts of human life\r\nare hidden from our eyes. Suddenly the mist rolls up, and reveals them, and\r\nwe think how much good time is gone, that might have been saved, had any\r\nhint of these things been shown. A sudden rise in the road shows us the\r\nsystem of mountains, and all the summits, which have been just as near us\r\nall the year, but quite out of mind. But these alternations are not without\r\ntheir order, and we are parties to our various fortune. If life seems\r\na succession of dreams, yet poetic justice is done in dreams also. The\r\nvisions of good men are good; it is the undisciplined will that is whipped\r\nwith bad thoughts and bad fortunes. When we break the laws, we lose our\r\nhold on the central reality. Like sick men in hospitals, we change only\r\nfrom bed to bed, from one folly to another; and it cannot signify much what\r\nbecomes of such castaways,--wailing, stupid, comatose creatures,--lifted\r\nfrom bed to bed, from the nothing of life to the nothing of death.\r\n\r\nIn this kingdom of illusions we grope eagerly for stays and foundations.\r\nThere is none but a strict and faithful dealing at home, and a severe\r\nbarring out of all duplicity or illusion there. Whatever games are played\r\nwith us, we must play no games with ourselves, but deal in our privacy with\r\nthe last honesty and truth. I look upon the simple and childish virtues of\r\nveracity and honesty as the root of all that is sublime in character. Speak\r\nas you think, be what you are, pay your debts of all kinds. I prefer to be\r\nowned as sound and solvent, and my word as good as my bond, and to be what\r\ncannot be skipped, or dissipated, or undermined, to all the _éclat_ in the\r\nuniverse. A little integrity is better than any career. This reality is the\r\nfoundation of friendship, religion, poetry, and art. At the top or at the\r\nbottom of all illusions I set the cheat which still leads us to work and\r\nlive for appearances, in spite of our conviction, in all sane hours, that\r\nit is what we really are that avails with friends, with strangers, and with\r\nfate or fortune.\r\n\r\nOne would think from the talk of men, that riches and poverty were a great\r\nmatter; and our civilization mainly respects it. But the Indians say, that\r\nthey do not think the white man with his brow of care, always toiling,\r\nafraid of heat and cold, and keeping within doors, has any advantage of\r\nthem. The permanent interest of every man is, never to be in a false\r\nposition, but to have the weight of Nature to back him in all that he does.\r\nRiches and poverty are a thick or thin costume; and our life--the life of\r\nall of us--identical. For we transcend the circumstance continually, and\r\ntaste the real quality of existence; as in our employments, which only\r\ndiffer in the manipulations, but express the same laws; or in our thoughts,\r\nwhich wear no silks, and taste no ice-creams. We see God face to face every\r\nhour, and know the savour of Nature.\r\n\r\nThe early Greek philosophers Heraclitus and Xenophanes measured their\r\nforce on this problem of identity. Diogenes of Apollonia said, that unless\r\nthe atoms were made of one stuff, they could never blend and act with one\r\nanother. But the Hindoos, in their sacred writings, express the liveliest\r\nfeeling, both of the essential identity, and of that illusion which they\r\nconceive variety to be. \"The notions, 'I am,' and 'This is mine,' which\r\ninfluence mankind, are but delusions of the mother of the world. Dispel,\r\nO Lord of all creatures! the conceit of knowledge which proceeds from\r\nignorance.\" And the beatitude of man they hold to lie in being freed from\r\nfascination.\r\n\r\nThe intellect is stimulated by the statement of truth in a trope, and the\r\nwill by clothing the laws of life in illusions. But the unities of Truth\r\nand of Right are not broken by the disguise. There need never be any\r\nconfusion in these. In a crowded life of many parts and performers, on a\r\nstage of nations, or in the obscurest hamlet in Maine or California, the\r\nsame elements offer the same choices to each new comer, and, according to\r\nhis election, he fixes his fortune in absolute nature. It would be hard to\r\nput more mental and moral philosophy than the Persians have thrown into a\r\nsentence:--\r\n\r\n  \"Fooled thou must be, though wisest of the wise;\r\n  Then be the fool of virtue, not of vice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIFT OF TRITEMIUS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Tritemius of Herbipolis one day,\r\n  While kneeling at the altar's foot to pray,\r\n  Alone with God, as was his pious choice,\r\n  Heard from beneath a miserable voice,--\r\n  A sound that seemed of all sad things to tell,\r\n  As of a lost soul crying out of hell.\r\n\r\n  Thereat the Abbot rose, the chain whereby\r\n  His thoughts went upward broken by that cry,\r\n  And, looking from the casement, saw below\r\n  A wretched woman, with gray hair aflow,\r\n  And withered hands stretched up to him, who cried\r\n  For alms as one who might not be denied.\r\n\r\n  She cried: \"For the dear love of Him who gave\r\n  His life for ours, my child from bondage save,\r\n  My beautiful, brave first-born, chained with slaves\r\n  In the Moor's galley, where the sun-smit waves\r\n  Lap the white walls of Tunis!\" \"What I can\r\n  I give,\" Tritemius said,--\"my prayers.\" \"O man\r\n  Of God!\" she cried, for grief had made her bold,\r\n  \"Mock me not so; I ask not prayers, but gold;\r\n  Words cannot serve me, alms alone suffice;\r\n  Even while I plead, perchance my first-born dies!\"\r\n\r\n  \"Woman!\" Tritemius answered, \"from our door\r\n  None go unfed; hence are we always poor.\r\n  A single soldo is our only store.\r\n  Thou hast our prayers; what can we give thee more?\"\r\n\r\n  \"Give me,\" she said, \"the silver candlesticks\r\n  On either side of the great crucifix;\r\n  God well may spare them on His errands sped,\r\n  Or He can give you golden ones instead.\"\r\n\r\n  Then said Tritemius, \"Even as thy word,\r\n  Woman, so be it; and our gracious Lord,\r\n  Who loveth mercy more than sacrifice,\r\n  Pardon me if a human soul I prize\r\n  Above the gifts upon His altar piled!\r\n  Take what thou askest, and redeem thy child.\"\r\n\r\n  But his hand trembled as the holy alms\r\n  He laid within the beggar's eager palms;\r\n  And as she vanished down the linden shade,\r\n  He bowed his head and for forgiveness prayed.\r\n\r\n  So the day passed; and when the twilight came\r\n  He rose to find the chapel all a-flame,\r\n  And, dumb with grateful wonder, to behold\r\n  Upon the altar candlesticks of gold!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOURNING VEIL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Then in life's goblet freely press\r\n  The leaves that give it bitterness,\r\n  Nor prize the colored waters less,\r\n  For in thy darkness and distress\r\n      New light and strength they give\r\n\r\n  And he who has not learned to know\r\n  How false its sparkling bubbles flow,\r\n  How bitter are the drops of woe\r\n  With which its brim may overflow,\r\n      He has not learned to live.\r\n\r\nLONGFELLOW.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was sunset. The day had been one of the sultriest of August. It would\r\nseem as if the fierce alembic of the last twenty-four hours had melted it\r\nlike the pearl in the golden cup of Cleopatra, and it lay in the West a\r\nfused mass of transparent brightness. The reflection from the edges of a\r\nhundred clouds wandered hither and thither, over rock and tree and flower,\r\ngiving a strange, unearthly brilliancy to the most familiar things.\r\n\r\nA group of children had gathered about their mother in the summer-house of\r\na garden which faced the sunset sky. The house was one of those square,\r\nstately, wooden structures, white, with green blinds, in which of old times\r\nthe better classes of New England delighted, and which remain to us as\r\nmemorials of a respectable past. It stood under the arches of two gigantic\r\nelms, and was flanked on either side with gardens and grounds which seemed\r\ndesigned on purpose for hospitality and family freedom.\r\n\r\nThe evening light colored huge bosquets of petunias, which stood with\r\ntheir white or crimson faces looking westward, as if they were thinking\r\ncreatures. It illumined flame-colored verbenas, and tall columns of pink\r\nand snowy phloxes, and hedges of August roses, making them radiant as the\r\nflowers of a dream.\r\n\r\nThe group in the summer-house requires more particular attention. The\r\nfather and mother, whom we shall call Albert and Olivia, were of the\r\nwealthiest class of the neighbouring city, and had been induced by the\r\nfacility of railroad travelling, and a sensible way of viewing things, to\r\nfix their permanent residence in the quiet little village of Q----. Albert\r\nhad nothing in him different from multitudes of hearty, joyous, healthily\r\nconstituted men, who subsist upon daily newspapers, and find the world a\r\nmost comfortable place to live in. As to Olivia, she was in the warm noon\r\nof life, and a picture of vitality and enjoyment. A plump, firm cheek, a\r\ndark eye, a motherly fulness of form, spoke the being made to receive and\r\nenjoy the things of earth, the warm-hearted wife, the indulgent mother,\r\nthe hospitable mistress of the mansion. It is true that the smile on the\r\nlip had something of earthly pride blended with womanly sweetness,--the\r\npride of one who has as yet known only prosperity and success, to whom no\r\nmischance has yet shown the frail basis on which human hopes are built. Her\r\nfoot had as yet trod only the high places of life, but she walked there\r\nwith a natural grace and nobleness that made every one feel that she was\r\nmade for them and they for her.\r\n\r\nAround the parents were gathered at this moment a charming group of\r\nchildren, who with much merriment were proceeding to undo a bundle the\r\nfather had just brought from the city.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Rose,\" said little Amy, a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired pet, who seemed\r\nto be a privileged character, \"let _me_ come; don't be all night with your\r\norderly ways; let me cut that string.\" A sharp flash of the scissors, a\r\nquick report of the bursting string, and the package lay opened to the\r\nlittle marauder. Rose drew back, smiled, and gave an indulgent look at\r\nher eager younger sister and the two little ones who immediately gathered\r\naround. She was one of those calm, thoughtful, womanly young girls, that\r\nseem born for pattern elder sisters, and for the stay and support of\r\nmothers' hearts. She watched with a gentle, quiet curiosity the quick and\r\neager fingers that soon were busy in exposing the mysteries of the parcel.\r\n\r\n\"There's a dress for Rose,\" said Amy, triumphantly drawing out a delicate\r\nmuslin; \"I can always tell what's for her.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\" put in the father, who stood regarding the proceeding with that air\r\nof amused superiority with which the wearers of broadcloth look down on the\r\nmysteries of muslin and barége.\r\n\r\n\"How?\" said Amy, \"why, because they look just like her. If I were to see\r\nthat lilac muslin in China, I should say it was meant for Rose. Now this is\r\nmine, I know,--this bright pink; isn't it, mamma? No half shades about me!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" said her mother; \"that is your greatest fault, Amy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, well, mamma, Rose has enough for both; you must rub us together, as\r\nthey do light red and Prussian blue, to make a neutral tint. But oh, what\r\na ribbon! oh, mother, what a love of a ribbon! Rose! Rose! look at this\r\nribbon! And oh, those buttons! Fred, I do believe they are for your new\r\ncoat! Oh, and those studs, father, where did you get them? What's in that\r\nbox? a bracelet for Rose, I know! oh, how beautiful! perfectly exquisite!\r\nAnd here--oh!\"\r\n\r\nHere something happened to check the volubility of the little speaker; for\r\nas she hastily, and with the license of a petted child, pulled the articles\r\nfrom the parcel, she was startled to find lying among the numerous colored\r\nthings a black crape veil. Sombre, dark, and ill-omened enough it looked\r\nthere, with pink, and lilac, and blue, and glittering _bijouterie_ around\r\nit!\r\n\r\nAmy dropped it with instinctive repugnance, and there was a general\r\nexclamation, \"Mamma, what's this? how came it here? what did you get this\r\nfor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Strange!\" said Olivia; \"it is a _mourning veil_. Of course I did not order\r\nit. How it came in here nobody knows; it must have been a mistake of the\r\nclerk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly it is a mistake,\" said Amy; \"we have nothing to do with\r\nmourning, have we?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, to be sure; what should we mourn for?\" chimed in little Fred and Mary.\r\n\r\n\"What a dark, ugly thing it is!\" said Amy, unfolding and throwing it over\r\nher head; \"how dismal it must be to see the world through such a veil as\r\nthis!\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet till one has seen the world through a veil like that, one has\r\nnever truly lived,\" said another voice, joining in the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Father Payson, are you there?\" said two or three voices at once.\r\n\r\nFather Payson was the minister of the village, and their nearest neighbor;\r\nand not only their nearest neighbor, but their nearest friend. In the\r\nafternoon of his years, life's day with him now stood at that hour when,\r\nthough the shadows fall eastward, yet the colors are warmer, and the songs\r\nof the birds sweeter, than even in its jubilant morning.\r\n\r\nGod sometimes gives to good men a guileless and holy second childhood, in\r\nwhich the soul becomes childlike, not childish, and the faculties in full\r\nfruit and ripeness are mellow without sign of decay. This is that songful\r\nland of Beulah, where they who have travelled manfully the Christian way\r\nabide awhile to show the world a perfected manhood. Life, with its battles\r\nand its sorrows, lies far behind them; the soul has thrown off its armor,\r\nand sits in an evening undress of calm and holy leisure. Thrice blessed the\r\nfamily or neighborhood that numbers among it one of these not yet ascended\r\nsaints! Gentle are they and tolerant, apt to play with little children,\r\neasy to be pleased with simple pleasures, and with a pitying wisdom guiding\r\nthose who err. New England has been blessed in numbering many such among\r\nher country pastors; and a spontaneous, instinctive deference honors them\r\nwith the title of Father.\r\n\r\nFather Payson was the welcome inmate of every family in the village,\r\nthe chosen friend even of the young and thoughtless. He had stories for\r\nchildren, jokes for the young, and wisdom for all. He \"talked good,\" as the\r\nphrase goes,--not because he was the minister, but because, being good,\r\nhe could not help it; yet his words, unconsciously to himself, were often\r\nparables, because life to him had become all spiritualized, and he saw\r\nsacred meanings under worldly things.\r\n\r\nThe children seized him lovingly by either hand and seated him in the\r\narbor.\r\n\r\n\"Isn't it strange,\" said Amy, \"to see this ugly black thing among all these\r\nbright colors? such a strange mistake in the clerk!\"\r\n\r\n\"If one were inclined to be superstitious,\" said Albert, \"he might call\r\nthis an omen.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did you mean, sir,\" asked Rose, quietly seating herself at his feet,\r\n\"by 'seeing life through this veil'?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a parable, my daughter,\" he said, laying his hand on her head.\r\n\r\n\"I never have had any deep sorrow,\" said Olivia, musingly; \"we have been\r\nfavored ones hitherto. But why did you say one must see the world through\r\nsuch a medium as this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sorrow is God's school,\" said the old man. \"Even God's own Son was not\r\nmade perfect without it; though a son, yet learned he obedience by the\r\nthings that he suffered. Many of the brightest virtues are like stars;\r\nthere must be night or they cannot shine. Without suffering, there could be\r\nno fortitude, no patience, no compassion, no sympathy. Take all sorrow out\r\nof life, and you take away all richness and depth and tenderness. Sorrow is\r\nthe furnace that melts selfish hearts together in love. Many are hard and\r\ninconsiderate, not because they lack capability of feeling, but because the\r\nvase that holds the sweet waters has never been broken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it, then, an imperfection and misfortune never to have suffered?\" said\r\nOlivia.\r\n\r\nFather Payson looked down. Rose was looking into his face. There was a\r\nbright, eager, yet subdued expression in her eyes that struck him; it had\r\noften struck him before in the village church. It was as if his words had\r\nawakened an internal angel, that looked fluttering out behind them. Rose\r\nhad been from childhood one of those thoughtful, listening children with\r\nwhom one seems to commune without words. We spend hours talking with them,\r\nand fancy they have said many things to us, which, on reflection, we find\r\nhave been said only with their silent answering eyes. Those who talk much\r\noften reply to you less than those who silently and thoughtfully listen.\r\nAnd so it came to pass, that, on account of this quietly absorbent nature,\r\nRose had grown to her parents' hearts with a peculiar nearness. Eighteen\r\nsummers had perfected her beauty. The miracle of the growth and perfection\r\nof a human body and soul never waxes old; parents marvel at it in every\r\nhousehold as if a child had never grown before; and so Olivia and Albert\r\nlooked on their fair Rose daily with a restful and trusting pride.\r\n\r\nAt this moment she laid her hand on Father Payson's knee, and said\r\nearnestly,--\"Ought we to pray for sorrow, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no, no, no!\" interrupted Olivia, with an instinctive shudder,--such a\r\nshudder as a warm, earnest, prosperous heart always gives as the shadow of\r\nthe grave falls across it,--\"don't say yes!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not say we should pray for it,\" said Father Payson; \"yet the Master\r\nsays, 'Blessed are they that mourn,' not 'Blessed are they that prosper.'\r\nSo heaven and earth differ in their judgments.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, me!\" said Olivia, \"I am afraid I have not courage to wish to be among\r\nthe blessed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Albert, whom the gravity of the discussion somewhat disturbed.\r\n\"let us not borrow trouble; time enough to think of it when it happens.\r\nCome, the dew is falling, let us go in. I want to show Father Payson some\r\npeaches that will tempt his Christian graces to envy. Come, Rose, gather up\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nRose, in a few moments, gathered the parcel together, and quietly flitted\r\nbefore them into the house.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Albert, \"you'll see that girl will have everything quietly\r\ntucked away in just the right place; not a word said. She is a born\r\nhousewife; it's in her, as much as it is in a pointer to show game.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rose is my right hand,\" said Olivia; \"I should be lost without her.\"\r\n\r\nWhence comes it, that, just on the verge of the great crises and\r\nafflictions of life, words are often spoken, that, to after view, seem to\r\nhave had a prophetic meaning? So often do we hear people saying, \"Ah, the\r\nvery day before I heard of this or that, we were saying so and so!\" It\r\nwould seem sometimes as if the soul felt itself being drawn within the dark\r\nsphere of a coming evil, of which as yet nothing outward tells. Then the\r\nthoughts and conversation flow in an almost prophetic channel, which a\r\ncoming future too well interprets.\r\n\r\nThe evening passed cheerfully with our friends, notwithstanding the grave\r\nconversation in the arbor. The mourning veil was laid away in a drawer\r\nalong with many of its brilliant companions, and with it the thoughts it\r\nhad suggested; and the merry laugh ringing from the half-open parlor-door\r\nshowed that Father Payson was no despiser of the command to rejoice with\r\nthem that do rejoice.\r\n\r\nRose played and sung, the children danced, and the mirth was prolonged till\r\na late hour in the evening.\r\n\r\nOlivia and Albert were lingering in the parlor after the departure of the\r\nfamily, busy in shutting windows, setting back chairs, and attending to all\r\nthe last duties of orderly householders.\r\n\r\nA sudden shriek startled them; such a shriek as, once heard, is never\r\nforgotten. With an answering cry of horror, they rushed up the stairs. The\r\nhall lamp had been extinguished, but the passage and staircase were red\r\nwith a broad glare from the open door of the nursery.\r\n\r\nA moment more showed them the drapery of the bed in which their youngest\r\nchild was sleeping all in flames; then they saw a light form tearing down\r\nthe blazing curtains.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Rose! Rose! take care, for God's sake! your dress! you'll kill\r\nyourself! oh, God help us!\"\r\n\r\nThere were a few moments--awful moments of struggle--when none knew or\r\nremembered what they did; a moment more and Rose lay panting in her\r\nfather's arms, enveloped in a thick blanket which he had thrown around her\r\nburning night-dress. The fire was extinguished, the babe lay unawakened,\r\nand only the dark flecks of tinder scattered over the bed, and the trampled\r\nmass on the floor, told what had been. But Rose had breathed the hot breath\r\nof the flame, deadly to human life, and no water could quench that inward\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nA word serves to explain all. The child's nurse had carelessly set a lamp\r\ntoo near the curtains, and the night breeze had wafted them into the flame.\r\nThe apartment of Rose opened into the nursery, and as she stood in her\r\nnight-dress before her mirror, arranging her hair, she saw the flashing of\r\nthe flame, and, in the one idea of saving her little sister, forgot every\r\nother. That act of self-forgetfulness was her last earthly act; a few short\r\nhours of patient suffering were all that remained to her. Peacefully as she\r\nhad lived, she died, looking tenderly on her parents out of her large blue\r\neyes, and only intent to soothe their pain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I suffer,\" she said, \"but only a short pain. We must all suffer\r\nsomething. My Father thinks a very little enough for me. I have had such a\r\nhappy life, I _might_ bear just a little pain at the last.\"\r\n\r\nA little later her mind seemed to wander. \"Mamma, mamma,\" she said,\r\nhurriedly, \"I put the things all away; the lilac muslin and the barége.\r\nMamma, that veil, the mourning veil, is in the drawer. Oh, mamma, that\r\nveil was for you; don't refuse it; our Father sends it, and he knows best.\r\nPerhaps you will see heaven through that veil.\"\r\n\r\nIt is appalling to think how near to the happiest and most prosperous\r\nscene of life stands the saddest despair. All homes are haunted with awful\r\npossibilities, for whose realization no array of threatening agents is\r\nrequired,--no lightning, or tempest, or battle; a peaceful household lamp,\r\na gust of perfumed evening air, a false step in a moment of gayety, a\r\ndraught taken by mistake, a match overlooked or mislaid, a moment's\r\noversight in handling a deadly weapon,--and the whole scene of life is\r\nirretrievably changed!\r\n\r\nIt was but a day after the scene in the arbor, and all was mourning in the\r\nso lately happy, hospitable house; everybody looked through tears. There\r\nwere subdued breathings, a low murmur, as of many listeners, a voice of\r\nprayer, and the wail of a funeral hymn,--and then the heavy tread of\r\nbearers, as, beneath the black pall, _she_ was carried over the threshold\r\nof her home, never to return.\r\n\r\nAnd Olivia and Albert came forth behind their dead. The folds of the dark\r\nveil seemed a refuge for the mother's sorrow. But how did the flowers of\r\nhome, the familiar elms, the distant smiling prospect look through its\r\ngloomy folds,--emblem of the shadow which had fallen between her heart and\r\nlife? When she looked at the dark moving hearse, she wondered that the sun\r\nstill shone, that birds could sing, and that even her own flowers could be\r\nso bright.\r\n\r\nAh, mother! the world had been just as full of sorrow the day before;\r\nthe air as full of \"farewells to the dying and mournings for the dead\";\r\nbut thou knewest it not! Now the outer world comes to thee through the\r\n_mourning veil_!\r\n\r\nBut after the funeral comes life again,--hard, cold, inexorable life,\r\nknocking with business-like sound at the mourner's door, obtruding its\r\ncommon-place pertinacity on the dull ear of sorrow. The world cannot wait\r\nfor us; the world knows no leisure for tears; it moves onward, and drags\r\nalong with its motion the weary and heavy-laden who would fain rest.\r\n\r\nOlivia would have buried herself in her sorrows. There are those who refuse\r\nto be comforted. The condolence of friends seems only a mockery; and truly,\r\nnothing so shows the emptiness and poverty of human nature as its efforts\r\nat condolence.\r\n\r\nFather Payson, however, was a visitor who would not be denied; there\r\nwas something of gentle authority in his white hairs that might not be\r\nresisted. Old, and long schooled in sorrow, his heart many times broken\r\nin past years, he knew all the ways of mourning. His was no official\r\ncommon-place about \"afflictive dispensations.\" He came first with that\r\ntender and reverent silence with which the man acquainted with grief\r\napproaches the divine mysteries of sorrow; and from time to time he\r\ncast on the troubled waters words, dropped like seeds, not for present\r\nfruitfulness, but to germinate after the floods had subsided.\r\n\r\nHe watched beside a soul in affliction as a mother waits on the crisis of a\r\nfever whose turning is to be for life or for death; for he well knew that\r\ngreat sorrows never leave us as they find us; that the broken spirit, ill\r\nset, grows callous and distorted ever after.\r\n\r\nHe had wise patience with every stage of sorrow; he knew that at first\r\nthe soul is blind, and deaf, and dumb. He was not alarmed when returning\r\nvitality showed itself only in moral spasms and convulsions; for in\r\nall great griefs come hours of conflict, when the soul is tempted, and\r\ncomplaining, murmuring, dark, skeptical thoughts are whirled like withered\r\nleaves through all its desolate chambers.\r\n\r\n\"What have I learned by looking through this veil?\" said Olivia to him,\r\nbitterly, one day when they were coming out of a house where they had been\r\nvisiting a mourning family. \"I was trusting in God as an indulgent Father;\r\nlife seemed beautiful to me in the light of his goodness; now I see only\r\nhis inflexible severity. I never knew before how much mourning and sorrow\r\nthere had been even in this little village. There is scarcely a house where\r\nsomething dreadful has not at some time happened. How many families here\r\nhave been called to mourning since we have! I have not taken up a paper in\r\nwhich I have not seen a record of two or three accidental deaths; some of\r\nthem even more bitter and cruel than what has befallen us. I read this\r\nmorning of a poor washerwoman, whose house was burned, and all her children\r\nconsumed, while she was away working for her bread. I read the other day of\r\na blind man whose only son was drowned in his very presence, while he could\r\ndo nothing to help him. I was visiting yesterday that poor dress-maker whom\r\nyou know. She has by toil and pains been educating a fine and dutiful son.\r\nHe is smitten down with hopeless disease, while her idiot child, who can\r\ndo nobody any good, is spared. Ah, this mourning veil has indeed opened my\r\neyes; but it has taught me to add all the sorrows of the world to my own;\r\nand can I believe in God's love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Daughter,\" said the old man, \"I am not ignorant of these things. I have\r\nburied seven children; I have buried my wife; and God has laid on me in my\r\ntime reproach, and controversy, and contempt. Each cross seemed, at the\r\ntime, heavier than the others. Each in its day seemed to be what I least\r\ncould bear; and I would have cried, '_Anything but this!_' And yet, now\r\nwhen I look back, I cannot see one of these sorrows that has not been made\r\na joy to me. With every one some perversity or sin has been subdued, some\r\nchain unbound, some good purpose perfected. God has taken my loved ones,\r\nbut he has given me love. He has given me the power of submission and of\r\nconsolation; and I have blessed him many times in my ministry for all I\r\nhave suffered, for by it I have stayed up many that were ready to perish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said Olivia, \"you indeed have reason to be comforted, because you can\r\nsee in yourself the fruit of your sorrows; but I am not improving; I am\r\nonly crushed and darkened,--not amended.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have patience with thyself, child; weeping must endure for a night;\r\nall comes not at once. 'No trial _for the present_ seemeth joyous'; but\r\n'_afterwards_ it yieldeth the peaceable fruit';--have faith in this\r\n_afterwards_. Some one says that it is not in the tempest one walks the\r\nbeach to look for the treasures of wrecked ships; but when the storm is\r\npast we find pearls and precious stones washed ashore. Are there not even\r\nnow some of these in your path? Is not the love between you and your\r\nhusband deeper and more intimate since this affliction? Do you not love\r\nyour other children more tenderly? Did you not tell me that you had thought\r\non the sorrows of every house in this village? Courage, my child! that is a\r\ngood sign. Once, as you read the papers, you thought nothing of those who\r\nlost friends; now you notice and feel. Take the sorrows of others to your\r\nheart; they shall widen and deepen it. Ours is a religion of sorrow. The\r\nCaptain of our salvation was made perfect through suffering; our Father is\r\nthe God of all consolation; our Teacher is named the Comforter; and all\r\nother mysteries are swallowed up in the mystery of the Divine sorrow. 'In\r\nall our afflictions He is afflicted.' God refuseth not to suffer;--shall\r\nwe?\"\r\n\r\nThere is no grave so desolate that flowers will not at last spring on it.\r\nTime passed with Albert and Olivia with healing in its wings. The secret\r\nplace of tears became first a temple of prayer, and afterwards of praise;\r\nand the heavy cloud was remembered by the flowers that sprung up after the\r\nrain. The vacant chair in the household circle had grown to be a tender\r\ninfluence, not a harrowing one; and the virtues of the lost one seemed to\r\nsow themselves like the scattered seeds of a fallen flower, and to spring\r\nup in the hearts of the surviving ones. More tender and more blessed is\r\noften the brooding influence of the sacred dead than the words of the\r\nliving.\r\n\r\nOlivia became known in the abodes of sorrow, and a deep power seemed given\r\nher to console the suffering and distressed. A deeper power of love sprung\r\nup within her; and love, though born of sorrow, ever brings peace with\r\nit. Many were the hearts that reposed on her; many the wandering that she\r\nreclaimed, the wavering that she upheld, the desolate that she comforted.\r\nAs a soul in heaven may look back on earth, and smile at its past sorrows,\r\nso, even here, it may rise to a sphere where it may look down on the storm\r\nthat once threatened to overwhelm it.\r\n\r\nIt was on the afternoon of just such another summer day as we have\r\ndescribed at the opening of our story, that Olivia was in her apartment,\r\ndirecting the folding and laying away of mourning garments. She took up the\r\ndark veil and looked on it kindly, as on a faithful friend. How much had\r\nshe seen and learned behind the refuge of its sheltering folds! She turned\r\nher thoughts within herself. She was calm once more, and happy,--happy with\r\na wider and steadier basis than ever before. A new world seemed opened\r\nwithin her; and with a heart raised in thankfulness she placed the veil\r\namong her most sacred treasures.\r\n\r\nYes, there by the smiling image of the lost one,--by the curls of her\r\nglossy hair,--by the faded flowers taken from her bier, was laid in solemn\r\nthankfulness the Mourning Veil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPENDLAM: A MODERN REFORMER.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy theatre-going friend pulled up suddenly in his ambling discourse\r\nconcerning the merits of the last actress, dropped his voice to a whisper,\r\ntouched my arm, and pointed with his cane.\r\n\r\n\"Look! the Reverend John Henry Pendlam!\"\r\n\r\n\"Coming out of a bar-room! Ho, ho! Sir Reverend!\"\r\n\r\nI spoke gayly, but with an indefinably serious sentiment at heart I was\r\ninterested in this John Henry Pendlam; not particularly on account of\r\nthe reputation for eloquence and zeal which he had so early and rapidly\r\nachieved, but his approaching marriage with my friend's second cousin,\r\nSusan D----, (whom I had myself even barely escaped marrying,) quickened a\r\npersonal curiosity regarding my successor.\r\n\r\n\"He is on no base errand,\" replied Horatio. \"He goes about carrying the\r\nGospel into these dens. The papers you see in his hand are tracts. Shall I\r\nintroduce you?\"\r\n\r\nBefore I could fairly answer, No, (for I felt a repugnance to making the\r\nacquaintance of any man who was to marry Susan,) Pendlam, standing a moment\r\nin the gas-light before the door of the saloon, observed my friend, and\r\nadvanced quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Too late to escape!\" cried the young clergyman, seizing Horatio by\r\nthe collar. \"I have you, truant!\" And he drew a tract upon him, like a\r\nrevolver.\r\n\r\n\"I surrender!\" said Horatio. \"If it's you, don't shoot; I'll come down, as\r\nthe treed coon said to the hunter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't think to disarm me by a pleasantry,\" replied Pendlam, brandishing\r\nhis spiritual weapon. \"This is my sermon on the theatre, which you engaged\r\nto hear me preach; I have had it printed for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Horatio, with a humorous smile, \"I had forgotten my promise.\r\nBesides, I was engaged,--let me see, it was two Sundays ago, wasn't\r\nit?--yes, I was engaged to dine with Miss Kellerton.\"\r\n\r\n\"The actress! On Sunday!\" said Pendlam, with a shocked expression. \"But you\r\nmight have heard me in the morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the morning we rode together,\" laughed Horatio.\r\n\r\nI knew all this was a fiction on the part of my friend, designed to mystify\r\nthe minister. I said nothing, to avoid an introduction; I had stepped\r\naside, and now stood, amused and observant, under the street lamp. Pendlam\r\nespecially I studied, with one eye (figuratively speaking) on him, and\r\nthe other on Susan. I compared him with myself, and had no doubt but she\r\nwas weak enough to consider him the handsomer man of the two. He was of\r\nmedium height, slightly built, of a nervous temperament, with bright,\r\nquick-glancing eyes, and vehement gestures. The chief characteristic of the\r\nman seemed intensity. It manifested itself in his eager movements, in his\r\nemphasis and tones of voice, in his swiftly changing expression, in his\r\nwild hair, in his neckerchief, which seemed to have been tied with a jerk,\r\nand in his dress throughout, which was evidently that of a man who had\r\nthings of vaster importance to think of.\r\n\r\nHe was whirling Horatio away in a torrent of eloquence, poured out against\r\nthe sins of the age, and mainly against the theatre, which he denounced as\r\nthe citadel of dissipation and all immoralities; and my poor friend, who\r\nhad opened the gates of this flood by his indiscreet pleasantry, was vainly\r\nendeavouring to escape and rejoin me, when I observed a person come out of\r\nthe saloon, and gradually draw near, until he stood within a few feet of\r\nthe zealous reformer. A group watched him from the door. Before I suspected\r\nhis object, he threw out the coils of a concealed whip, and springing upon\r\nPendlam from behind, dealt him furious successive blows over the shoulders\r\nand head. I ran to the rescue. But already Horatio had seized the whip.\r\n\r\n\"Good for evil,\" cried Pendlam, as I was on the point of throttling the\r\nassailant. \"My friend, how have I injured you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Interfering with my business! getting away my custom! insulting folks with\r\nyour cursed tracts!\" frothed the angry man. \"I swore to cowhide you, and\r\nI've done it!\"\r\n\r\n\"If that is the case, I have no complaint to make,\" said Pendlam. \"You can\r\ngo on with your cowhiding.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've had enough for once!\" growled the other, rolling up the lash.\r\n\r\n\"But if I deserve whipping for doing my duty, I deserve a good deal more,\"\r\ncried Pendlam. \"And if you are to be my castigator for each offence, you\r\nwill find yourself pretty well employed. It would be less trouble, I should\r\nthink, to do a little more, while you have your hand in. Meanwhile, take\r\nthis tract upon the sin of Anger, carry it home with you, and read it\r\ncarefully at your leisure.\"\r\n\r\nMuttering threats, the man returned to the saloon, amid the laughs and\r\nacclamations of his constituents. Pendlam followed impulsively, and left\r\nthe tract within. He then returned to us. Up to this time, he had appeared\r\nexalted and firm; but now there came a reaction; his voice forsook him,\r\nhe trembled violently, and we were obliged to give him the support of our\r\narms. As we conducted him away, his condition might have been taken for\r\nthat of many others who get into difficulty in bar-rooms. Arrived at his\r\nboarding-house, he thanked us with pathetic earnestness, and urged us to go\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"On one condition,\" said Horatio,--\"that you say no more about the\r\ntheatres.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam smiled faintly. \"I should think I might refrain from that and\r\nkindred topics, at least until my shoulders have done smarting! But I\r\nassure you, my zeal will only be quickened by the occurrences of this\r\nnight. The first horsewhipping is a great event. I now know what it is to\r\nbe a martyr!\"\r\n\r\nWe went in and conversed. My repugnance to forming a friendship with\r\nthe man who was to marry Susan had vanished. I found him rather too\r\nzealous,--almost fanatical; but we forgive every thing in a man who shows\r\ngenerosity of heart, and sincere aspirations. Horatio took a paper from\r\nhis pocket and read for the twentieth time a certain criticism upon Miss\r\nKellerton's acting; occasionally looking up, to listen to some remark from\r\neither Pendlam or myself,--then returning to his favorite article.\r\n\r\nI had the honor of differing, on many essential points, with my new\r\nclerical acquaintance; and we were soon on excellent terms of courteous\r\ndispute. I assumed the philosopher, and expressed candidly my conviction\r\nthat his intellect had early projected itself into doctrines which would\r\nprove too confined for its future growth. I remember distinctly his reply.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it is you,\" he said, \"who, I perceive, will some day come\r\nover upon the very ground I now occupy. Our modern ways of thinking have\r\nbecome too free and lax. We cannot draw the rein and tighten the girth.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a charming sparkle in his blue eyes as he spoke. I gave him my\r\nhand, and we parted. As we walked away together, Horatio asked how I liked\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"He is in earnest, and that is everything. But mark me, he is not the man\r\nfor Susan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your jealousy!\" said Horatio.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit! I see a discrepancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In my mind's eye, Horatio.\"\r\n\r\nI concluded that silence was discretion, and refused to answer more\r\nquestions. Horatio looked at his watch.\r\n\r\n\"We have just time to see Miss Kellerton in the last act of 'The Stranger.'\r\nShe is great! You should see her, when she turns and embraces the children;\r\nit's a scene of overwhelming pathos! Come!\"\r\n\r\n\"With Pendlam's printed sermon in your pocket?\"\r\n\r\nHoratio laughed. \"We will read it during the dance!\"\r\n\r\nBut I declined; and he went alone into the theatre.\r\n\r\nNot long after, I received a certain wedding card, and, in consequence,\r\nmade a certain call. Susan was all blushes and smiles at sight of me; but I\r\nwas cool and circumspect.\r\n\r\n\"We are friends, are we not?\" I said, \"We once thought we were more than\r\nthat; but we became older and wiser. We agreed to disagree, very properly.\r\nIt did not break our hearts; and that shows that it is better as it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" murmured Susan.\r\n\r\n\"Let us be quite frank with each other; that is the best way, Susan. We are\r\ngood friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes!\" said Susan.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, dear Susan,--if I may still call you so, in the sense of\r\nfriendship. I know your husband, and love him. I congratulate you on having\r\nso noble a companion.\"\r\n\r\nSusan sighed, and concealed a tear. Just then Pendlam entered. He seemed\r\nabstracted, and took a quick turn across the room; then gave me a surprised\r\nlook, a pleased smile, and a cordial grasp of the hand. The next hour I\r\nwas oblivious of all external things, in the delightful excitement of our\r\nconversation. I even forgot Susan. Poor Susan! the trouble was, she was\r\nnot intellectual; not at all imaginative; but a very plain, matter-of-fact\r\nperson, with deep affections, and paramount instincts. During that\r\nmemorable hour, she spoke not one word. When at length I observed her\r\nconsciously, she was gazing at us with a look of weariness and vacancy.\r\n\r\n\"Is it not so?\" cried Pendlam.\r\n\r\nHe appealed to her. She smiled sweetly, and said with simplicity that she\r\nscarcely understood any thing that had been said.\r\n\r\nI could see that Pendlam was a little shocked. From clear, joyous heights\r\nof poetic discourse, we looked down, and saw how far off below was her\r\nbeingless mind. To the vision we then enjoyed, there was something thick\r\nand earthy in her expression. It was the first time Pendlam had observed\r\nit; I had seen it before. And even as before, I looked back, with wonder at\r\nmyself, to the earlier period when I deemed her beauty peerless.\r\n\r\nBoth Pendlam and I were chilled. The fine tension of the spiritual chords\r\nrelaxed, and gave forth heavier music. Susan failing to ascend to us, we\r\ncame down to her. She now made haste to atone for her long silence by\r\ntalking freely of the pretty new church, and the people she saw out Sunday;\r\nand she seemed proud and happy when she brought out her wedding gifts, and\r\nI praised them.\r\n\r\nIt was several weeks before I again saw Pendlam. I went with Horatio to\r\nhear him preach. The sermon surprised me. Many of the thoughts which I\r\nhad advanced in our private conversations, and which he had opposed, were\r\nreproduced, but very slightly modified, in his discourse.\r\n\r\n\"Pendlam is enlarging,\" whispered Horatio. \"The very things you said to him\r\nthe first time you met!\"\r\n\r\nI was gratified by the fact, and gratified that Horatio observed it;\r\nregarding it as evidence of Pendlam's emancipation from his chains.\r\n\r\nThe services over, the young clergyman made his way to us through the\r\ncrowd.\r\n\r\n\"I have so much wished to see you!\" he exclaimed, grasping my hand. \"You\r\nwere a little astonished at my sermon.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a good deal pleased,\" I added.\r\n\r\nPendlam's delicate and changing features colored finely.\r\n\r\n\"You think I have altered my views, I see by your smile. Not at all, except\r\nthat I have gone farther.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have gone farther,\" I answered.\r\n\r\n\"But in the same direction, I assure you!\" said Pendlam, quickly. \"Step by\r\nstep, step by step.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were on your way back to Paul and the Fathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and on my arrival among them, I found myself one of the Fathers! It\r\nwas a necessary experience. As Paul spoke by authority, so I, when I stand\r\nwhere Paul stood, also speak by authority. We must first be obedient,\r\nbefore we can be free. You see where I am,\" said Pendlam.\r\n\r\nHere a young woman came forward, and, with tears in her eyes, thanked her\r\npastor for the glorious truths he had that day preached.\r\n\r\n\"They are not my truths; they are the Lord's; I am but his mouthpiece,\"\r\nanswered Pendlam, well pleased.\r\n\r\nA gray-haired deacon now approached.--\"On the hull,\" said he, \"I liked your\r\nsarmon tolerable well, Brother Pendlam; but it warn't one o' your best;\r\nand if anybody else had preached it, I should have thought it contained a\r\nlittle dangerous doctrine.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam blushed. This compliment did not please him quite so well. But\r\nbefore he could shape a reply, quite an old woman seized his hand and\r\nkissed it.\r\n\r\n\"God bless you for those words! They have done my soul good, sir!\"\r\n\r\nHer gratitude and piety were quite affecting. Tears gushed into Pendlam's\r\neyes. The deacon turned away with a smirk and an ominous shake of the head.\r\n\r\nHoratio had found Susan. Pendlam took my arm, and we walked out of the\r\nchurch. The crowd pressed on before us; and as we reached the vestibule, we\r\noverheard suppressed voices the merits of the sermon.\r\n\r\n\"It was full of beautiful truth!\" said a sweet young girl's voice.\r\n\r\n\"The most eloquent discourse I ever heard!\" added a young man with a\r\nsinging-book under his arm.\r\n\r\n\"For my part,\" remarked a portly and well-dressed pillar of the church, \"I\r\nwas a good deal surprised. Rather too wild and flowery. Must have a bad\r\ntendency.\"\r\n\r\n\"What we want is sound doctrine,\" observed another prosperous pillar.\r\n\"Better let such abstract subjects alone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dangerous doctrine! dangerous doctrine!\" chimed in the gray-haired deacon.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the open air, I observed that Pendlam was quite tremulous and\r\nflushed.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he said with a smile, \"what it is to be a minister.\"\r\n\r\nWe went home to his house. Horatio had arrived before us, in company with\r\nSusan and her mother. The latter was looking very uncomfortable at seeing\r\nme, I thought, for she had hated me cordially since my affair with her\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n\"I declare, John Henry,\" she said, in her energetic way, \"I hope you never\r\nwill preach another such sermon as long as _I_ live! I couldn't make\r\nneither head nor tail to it.\" And she gathered up her Sunday things, which\r\nshe had taken off in the parlour, with an air of offended piety that\r\noccasioned a general smile. Pendlam smiled with the rest.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Horatio, you next,--what did you think of my sermon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I liked it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! but give your reason.\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you said nothing about the theatre. I was mortally afraid you\r\nwould; for, d'ye see, you had a distinguished theatrical personage in your\r\naudience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! I was not aware; who?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Kellerton herself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\" Pendlam looked surprised, Susan interested, Mrs. D----\r\n(with her Sunday things on her arm) amazed.\r\n\r\n\"She told me she was going to hear you, to show you that she could be quite\r\nas tolerant as yourself. She expects you to return the compliment, and go\r\nto her benefit.\"\r\n\r\nPoor Pendlam hardly knew what to say in his confusion. Susan spoke up,--\r\n\r\n\"Why didn't you point her out to me? I have such a curiosity to see her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was to her I took off my hat, coming away from the church door.\"\r\n\r\n\"To her!\" broke forth Mrs. D----, \"to an actress! Horatio, I'm ashamed of\r\nyou. You wouldn't have caught me walking with you, if I had known!\" She\r\nshook her Sunday things indignantly; and there was another general smile,\r\nas she took these representatives of her piety abruptly out of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Ail this is very interesting,\" said Pendlam, recovering his equanimity. \"I\r\nwonder what sort of a sermon I shall preach next Sabbath?\"\r\n\r\nWe were invited to stay to luncheon. Horatio consented; but I declined, and\r\ntook my leave, much to the gratification of Susan's mother, no doubt.\r\n\r\nSome months passed before I again saw Pendlam. Our next meeting was in the\r\nstreet. I observed him coming towards me with the peculiarly abstracted and\r\nintense expression which his face assumed under excitement.\r\n\r\n\"What now?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"A little difficulty with my people,\" he said, with a forced smile. \"I have\r\njust come from a church meeting; it was terribly hot there!\"\r\n\r\n\"No serious trouble, I hope?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no,--only, you will hardly be surprised to hear, my preaching has been\r\nsomewhat too liberal for them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, sir,\" I cried, \"if I remember right, you were for restoring the more\r\nrigorous and stringent forms of religion; drawing the rein and tightening\r\nthe girth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly! and do you not see? Step by step I worked back to the\r\nprimitive and central principle, the soul of all religion. You know what\r\nthat is. It is Love! This I have preached,\" said Pendlam, his features\r\nsuffused, his eyes glistening bright; \"and this I shall continue to preach,\r\nwhile life lasts. Persecution cannot influence me. I know my duty, and I\r\nshall perform it, at all risks. You see where I am,\" added Pendlam.\r\n\r\nI was thrilled to admiration by his enthusiasm and heroic resolution. At\r\nthe same time I saw him in that transitional state which is so full of\r\nperil to persons of certain temperaments, escaping into too sudden freedom\r\nand light from the walls of a narrow and gloomy belief; and I could not\r\nbut smile, with mingled amusement and commiseration, at his singular\r\nstep-by-step processes.\r\n\r\nIt was during the following autumn that Horatio and I one day looked in\r\nupon a reform meeting, held at the Melodeon. The audience was thin, the\r\nspeakers numerous. The platform was crowded with male and female reformers,\r\namong whom I recognized our clerical friend Pendlam. A celebrated female\r\norator sat down, and Pendlam stood up. The audience cheered a little; the\r\nplatform cheered a good deal. He at first stammered and hesitated, not from\r\nwant of thoughts, but from their pressure and multitude. They soon fused,\r\nhowever, and poured forth streams of fire, rather largely mixed with smoke.\r\n\r\n\"There is no other religion but Love,\" declared the speaker. \"And where\r\nLove is, there is Religion; in the Mohammedan, in the Mormon, in the\r\nsavage,--I care not for names. And where Love is not, there Religion is\r\nnot, though her image be preserved and clothed in all Christian forms.\r\nTheology and sects fall away from it; it is alone vital; it is eternal, it\r\nis unitary, it is God. Here I proclaim it to the world; here I announce to\r\nyou and to all where I stand.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech was reported along with others in the morning papers. It was\r\nnot long before Pendlam had more church business to perplex him; and he\r\nsoon withdrew from the pastorship of his troublesome flock. A number of\r\nthese went with him; there was a schism in the church; and the following\r\nspring, a new society was formed, which gave Pendlam a call.\r\n\r\nI also gave him a call, at his house. Changes had taken place since my last\r\nvisit. I was shocked at Susan's altered appearance. She had had an infant,\r\nand untold trouble along with it. The bloom of the bride was gone, and\r\nthe finer permeating beauty of the happy mother had failed to replace it.\r\nMrs. D---- was with her. This excellent lady received me with surprising\r\npoliteness, and brought out the little Pendlam for my inspection.\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible, Susan, that this living, breathing, dimpled little wonder\r\nis yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose it is,\" said the blushing Susan.\r\n\r\n\"Where is its father?\" I inquired, for John Henry had not yet appeared.\r\n\r\n\"It hasn't got any father!\" ejaculated Mrs. D----, with grim sarcasm. \"A\r\nman can't be a reform-preacher, and a father too. His sermons, lectures,\r\nand conventions are of too much importance for him even to think of his\r\nwife and child.\"\r\n\r\nI looked to see poor Susan writhe with pain under these harsh words. But\r\nshe merely heaved a sigh, and let fall a tear on the babe, which she had\r\ntaken from its grandmother's arms.\r\n\r\n\"I will speak to Mr. Pendlam,\" she said, as she hastily left the room.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have come,\" said Mrs. D----, bitterly, seating herself on\r\nthe sofa. \"I am glad to see any person enter this house, who isn't all\r\neaten up with the evils of society. I have heard about the evils of society\r\ntill I'm heartily sick of them. People that come to see Pendlam don't\r\ngenerally talk about anything else. It's the ruin of him, as I tell Susan;\r\nI never in this world can be reconciled to his leaving his church.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. D---- became confidential, and abused her daughter's husband in a\r\nstyle which did not argue much for the peace of his household during that\r\nenergetic lady's visits. Her indignation against him had quite swallowed\r\nup her old cherished resentment against myself. She soon went so far as to\r\ninsinuate a regret that Susan had not married a man of solid sense and some\r\nmental ballast, (meaning me,) instead of a hotheaded reformer.\r\n\r\nSusan reentered. \"Mr. Pendlam is very busy; but he will come down\r\npresently.\"\r\n\r\nShe sighed, and took a seat. Mrs. D---- continued her abuse of her\r\nson-in-law, in her daughter's presence,--which I thought in very bad taste,\r\nto say the least. Susan uttered not one word in her husband's defence,\r\nbut simply sat and sighed. I defended and praised him; for which act of\r\nfriendship I earned not one look of gratitude from her, and only contempt\r\nand sneers from her mother.\r\n\r\nI was glad when Pendlam appeared. He was looking care-worn and toil-worn;\r\nhis expression had grown more intense than ever. His face lighted up a\r\nlittle at sight of me; but it was some minutes before his mind seemed\r\ncapable of extricating itself from its abstractions, and meeting me upon\r\nsocial grounds.\r\n\r\n\"You will excuse me. I am heartily rejoiced to see you. I was hard at work.\r\nJust pass your hand over my forehead; it will relieve the pressure upon\r\nmy brain. My mission is now fully revealed to me; everything is reform,\r\nreform. I have been led here step by step. Your magnetism is very soothing.\r\nThe old crumbling walls of creeds and conventionalities are to be swept\r\naway, and their foundations subjected to the plough and the harrow. I am in\r\nthe harness. I have no motive for concealment; I tell you frankly where I\r\nstand,\" said Pendlam. Another long sigh from Susan. Mrs. D---- tossed her\r\ncontemptuous chin, and expressed scorn in divers significant ways.\r\n\r\n\"I should want to conceal a little, if I was in your place,\" she remarked,\r\ncuttingly.\r\n\r\n\"Truth is truth; it can harm only those who are in error,\" said Pendlam.\r\n\r\n\"It certainly hasn't done you a very great amount of good.\" Another toss of\r\nthe contemptuous chin.\r\n\r\n\"On the contrary, it has done me incalculable good,\" answered the\r\nson-in-law, with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you consider it good, then, to be cut off from the church,--to give up\r\na good situation and sure salary,--to lose the respect of everybody whose\r\nrespect is worth having!\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have done all this for the truth's sake, it is good,\"--the reformer's\r\nface kindled with enthusiasm,--\"and I for one find it good.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you do, but I know who don't. I believe reform, like charity,\r\nbegins at home. You talk of your duty to humanity; I believe the first duty\r\nis to one's own family. I don't think much of that man's mission to the\r\nworld, who forgets his own wife and child.\"\r\n\r\nHoratio had previously told me, what I could hardly believe, that Mrs.\r\nD---- was accustomed to abuse her son-in-law in this way, in the presence\r\nof strangers. Susan did nothing but sigh. Pendlam smiled, as if he was used\r\nto it.\r\n\r\n\"I need a little such invective occasionally, to refresh my zeal,\" he\r\nsaid, with provoking meekness. \"It shows me where I am. It assures me\r\nthat I am fighting the good fight. I do not blame my good mother; she\r\nis worldly-minded, and sees things from her stand-point. Neither she nor\r\nSusan can perceive anything but loss and disgrace, in the change from the\r\nhandsome, fashionable church, where I used to preach, to the naked hall\r\nwhere our new society holds its meetings. Very natural for people upon\r\ntheir plane. But I view things from another stand-point, to which I have\r\nbeen led step by step; and I have simply to be true to my own revealed\r\nmission.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mission! revealed! step by step! planes and stand-points!\" exclaimed Mrs.\r\nD----, rising in great disgust. \"For my part, I believe in common sense; I\r\ndon't know any other plane or stand-point, and _I_ don't believe Providence\r\never intended we should have any other. There, you have my opinion!\" And\r\nwith a violent gesture, as if throwing her opinion from her, and shutting\r\nour little party into the room with that formidable object, she swept out,\r\nslammed the door after her, and rustled remorselessly up stairs.\r\n\r\n\"Persons upon her plane are very much to be pitied,\" observed Pendlam,\r\nquietly.\r\n\r\nSusan began to cry, and the scene became so painful to me, that I made\r\nhaste to shake hands with the ill-mated couple, say a few soothing words,\r\nand take leave of them. From that time, I saw Pendlam occasionally, but\r\navoided the house. It was a peculiarity of his impressible nature, to\r\nimbibe, unconsciously to himself, the sentiments of powerful persons\r\nwith whom he came in contact, retain and revolve them in his intellect,\r\nuntil they reappeared as his own original convictions. He now went with\r\nreformers, and carried with him their atmosphere. To hear him talk, you\r\nwould have thought universal reorganization at hand. I said I avoided\r\nthe house; but one day Horatio came to me with a doleful face, backing a\r\npetition that I would go and talk with Susan.\r\n\r\n\"There has been an explosion! The old woman is gone; she has declared open,\r\ninternecine war against Pendlam.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought she had declared that some time ago, good Horatio!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, but now she is trying to get his wife away from him! She has sent\r\nplenipotentiaries, with threats and entreaties, and they have frightened\r\nSusan out of her poor little wits. Go and reassure her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horatio, I am not certain what would be best. They never belonged\r\ntogether. But at your request, I will go and see what I can do.\"\r\n\r\nI went. Susan received me with an effort at a smile, which was a failure,\r\nand at my inquiry for Pendlam, burst into tears.\r\n\r\n\"He is not dead, I hope.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" sobbed Susan.\r\n\r\n\"Nor in jail?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.\" Another sob.\r\n\r\n\"Nor in any serious trouble?\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble enough, Heaven knows! Mother has gone. I don't know what to do.\r\nAll the nice people we used to visit with have turned against us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our happiness does not depend upon nice people, you know, dear Susan.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he is getting into the strangest ways! Shabby folks, with long beards,\r\ncome to see him. He has left off family devotions.\"\r\n\r\nSusan was weeping; when, at a quick step in the hall, she took alarm, and\r\nhurried from the room, just in time to hide her tears from her husband.\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\" said Pendlam.\r\n\r\n\"No; Susan has just left me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you have come. I have thought for several days that I required\r\nyour magnetism. Every thing with me now is magnetism. My nature demands a\r\ncertain magnetism, as the appetite demands a certain quality of food. There\r\nare coarse magnetisms, and fine magnetisms; yours is peculiarly agreeable\r\nto me. Some repel me, and some attract irresistibly. I have only to follow\r\nmy impressions, to get what is necessary for me. That's where I am,\" said\r\nPendlam.\r\n\r\nHe urged me to stay and dine; and as I desired an opportunity to converse\r\nfurther with Susan, I consented. I was surprised to see a dish of roast\r\nmeat come upon the table,--Pendlam having, for the past year, preached\r\nvegetarianism. But he assured me that he had not changed his theory of\r\ndietetics.\r\n\r\n\"There are times, however, when we require the magnetisms of certain animal\r\nfoods. To-day I perceived that my system demanded the magnetism of lamb.\r\nIf your constitution is wanting in the lamb element, you will find this\r\ntender.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam, I should observe, had neglected to say grace.\r\n\r\n\"Your theory of magnetisms,\" said I, \"would seem a very convenient one.\r\nTo-morrow, for example, you can require the magnetism of roast beef.\r\nThe next day, the magnetisms of turtle-soup and venison will be found\r\nagreeable. The magnetisms of some birds are said to be excellent. And\r\nI have no doubt but in time you will arrive at the discovery, that the\r\nmagnetism of a certain distilled beverage, called brandy, stimulates\r\ndigestion.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam laughed and blushed.\r\n\r\n\"I have not forgotten that for three good years of my life I waged war\r\nagainst King Alchohol. (Will you try a bit of the lamb?) But I do not push\r\nmy principles over the verge of prejudice, as those do who condemn the\r\ngrape.\"\r\n\r\n\"Condemn the grape?\" I repeated.\r\n\r\n\"The juice of the grape, which is the same thing. Where this can be\r\nobtained pure, it will be found highly beneficial to persons on a certain\r\nplane. The grape magnetism is eminently spiritualizing.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, to my utter astonishment, Pendlam uncorked a small bottle, which\r\nI had supposed to contain pepper-sauce, and commenced pouring out WINE.\r\n\r\n\"This will answer in lieu of grace,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"The act of prayer,\" said Pendlam, \"has indisputable uses. It opens the\r\navenues to an influx of spiritual magnetisms. But where the mind is kept\r\nin the receptive condition without the aid of the external form of prayer,\r\nthis becomes like a scaffolding after the house is built. Step by step, I\r\nhave been led to this high spiritual plane.\"\r\n\r\nSusan, as of old, sat and sighed.\r\n\r\nPendlam found my magnetism so attractive, that it was impossible for me to\r\nobtain a minute's conversation with Susan alone. I departed, wearied and\r\ndisheartened with her sad, despairing face haunting me.\r\n\r\nI had little further personal knowledge of Pendlam's career, until Horatio\r\ncame for me, one evening, to attend a meeting of the Disciples of Freedom.\r\n\r\nWe found the Melodeon crowded by one of those stifling audiences for which\r\nno ventilation seems availing. A portion had come to be interested, a\r\nportion to be amused. To the former, the object of the meeting was wise and\r\ngreat; to the latter, it was ridiculous enough to be worth an evening's\r\nsenseless laughter. For my own part, only the strong desire I felt to\r\nobserve the characteristics of a new sect daily increasing in numbers and\r\ninfluence could induce me to undergo the exhaustion of sitting an hour in\r\nsuch an assembly.\r\n\r\nWe took seats in an obscure corner, and looked around. Here were curious,\r\nlank stalks of humanity, which seemed to have been raked from unheard-of,\r\noutlandish stubbles. Occasionally, in beautiful relief out of these, a\r\nclear, full-berried stem of ripened grain lifted its gracious head. It was\r\na strange mixture; a strange power, indeed, that had swept together such\r\npromising wheat and such refuse chaff and straw in one incongruous mass.\r\n\r\nWe turned our eyes to the platform. There sat Pendlam, with other prominent\r\nDisciples. A young man was speaking wise and beautiful words. From the\r\nwell of a deep and sincere soul he drew needed counsel for the perishing\r\nmultitude; said what he seemed impelled to say, and sat down. He was\r\nfollowed by a sallow-visaged, black-bearded speaker, who poured forth\r\nabundant venomous froth of denunciation. He had caught enough of the\r\nphraseology of the more philosophical Disciples, to impress the earnest\r\nignorant with some show of profundity. I was glad when his stream dried up.\r\nPendlam next arose and read a paper upon \"Magnetisms and Organizations.\"\r\nAfter him, came forward a gentleman with a model, illustrating the design\r\nof a dwelling-house for the Associated Disciples. He showed, entirely\r\nto the satisfaction of himself at least, that society should be reduced\r\nto a mechanism, and mankind to pivots and wheels. This was the dawn of\r\nthe millennial era. The world was to be saved by organization. First, an\r\nassociation; then an association of associations, which should spread\r\nover the United States, abolish taxes, banks, slavery, and private\r\nproperty, elect its president, annex South America, the British and\r\nRussian possessions, and eventually Europe, Africa, and Asia. The model\r\ndwelling-house was likened to a manger, in which Christ was to be born,\r\nat his second coming. The speaker ended by introducing the \"Practical\r\nOrganizer of the Initial Association of Free Disciples.\"\r\n\r\nHoratio and myself had already remarked upon the platform an individual\r\nwhose features seemed somehow familiar to us. He was rather stoutly built,\r\nfull-faced, of a sanguine complexion and temperament. His mouth indicated\r\nboth sensuality and decision of character. His forehead was prominent and\r\nlow, his eye keen, his neck thick and muscular. We were not surprised to\r\nsee him arise and step forward as the Practical Organizer of the Initial\r\nAssociation of Free Disciples.\r\n\r\n\"Ladies and gentlemen,\" said he, \"I am no orator. I am a business man. I am\r\nnot here to make a speech, but to tell you about the practical part of this\r\nAssociation.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first words he spoke, a flood of recollections rushed over me. For a\r\nmoment my breath was quite taken away.\r\n\r\n\"I know him!\" \"I remember him!\" Horatio and I whispered almost\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nHis voice was unmistakable. He was the fellow who had flogged Pendlam four\r\nyears before.\r\n\r\nExtremes had met. The temperance missionary and the infuriate liquor-dealer\r\nstood upon the same platform.\r\n\r\nSoon after, we took our leave. We walked up and down in the fresh air. How\r\nsweet, how cool it seemed, after an hour spent amid the heated breaths of\r\nthe packed audience!\r\n\r\nI had parted from my friend, and was returning home, when I met two persons\r\nwalking arm in arm. I heard one of them say,--\r\n\r\n\"I find that no great work can be accomplished, without due regard paid\r\nto magnetisms; and in organization, we must take care that they are\r\nharmoniously distributed. I find that I now assume relations with every\r\nindividual according to these subtile laws. You see where I am,\" said\r\nPendlam.\r\n\r\nFor Pendlam was the speaker. His companion was the Practical Organizer of\r\nthe Initial Association of Free Disciples.\r\n\r\nI went home, filled with a multitude of reflections. Strong interest led\r\nme soon after to pay a visit to Pendlam's house. As I went in, I met a\r\nman coming out. He had a stout frame, keen eye, sensual mouth, sanguine\r\ncomplexion, muscular neck.\r\n\r\n\"Susan,\" said I, \"who is that man?\"\r\n\r\n\"One of my husband's friends,\" answered Susan, in some confusion.\r\n\r\n\"And yours?\"--eyeing her closely.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he comes frequently to the house; I see him occasionally.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Tis he who gave Pendlam that bottle of wine?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe so.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that flogging, Susan!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, they have made that up,\" said Susan, innocently.\r\n\r\n\"If they are satisfied, I have nothing to say. Are you happy, Susan?\" for a\r\nchange had come over her, which I did not readily understand.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, dear!\" said Susan, \"we have had so much trouble!\" She began to give\r\nway to her emotions. \"We have lost all our old friends. Mother never comes\r\nnear us now. Sometimes I don't know what we shall do. Tell me what you\r\nthink of it;--is Henry so much out of the way as people think? He certainly\r\nknows more than anybody else, and I don't see how he can be wrong.\" She\r\nended with a sob.\r\n\r\n\"You are aware,\" I answered, \"that Pendlam and I partly agree in every\r\nthing, and wholly agree in nothing. He is right, and he is wrong. He takes\r\nhold of what is a truth, but detaches it from universal truth, and so it\r\nbecomes an error.\" I saw she did not comprehend. \"But never despair,\" I\r\nadded, \"The future depends upon you.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can I do?\" she pleaded.\r\n\r\n\"Remain firm in principle, dear Susan. Whatever happens, stand true to him\r\nand to yourself. Do that, and all will be well.\"\r\n\r\nThe crying of her child, which was sick, called her away. I sought\r\nPendlam's study. I found him busily writing. He was pale and thin, and\r\nthere was a wild brightness in his eye which did not please me.\r\n\r\n\"You, of all men!\" he exclaimed. \"Sit down.\" He closed the door, with an\r\nair of mystery. \"I was just writing to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"To me? Then I have saved you the trouble of employing a messenger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Susan would be mortified and incensed, if she knew what I am about to say.\r\nBut truth is truth. She is perishing; I see new evidence of it every day.\r\nIt is for want of magnetisms. I have little to give her, and what I have\r\nis not such as she requires. Do not be astonished when I tell you I have\r\ndiscovered that there do not exist between us the requisite affinities.\"\r\n\r\nI smiled; for Pendlam was continually announcing discoveries of facts I had\r\ndiscovered long before.\r\n\r\n\"You see where I am,\" said Pendlam. \"I am compelled to go to other women\r\nfor the magnetisms I need; she must receive what she requires from other\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is interesting,\" I replied. \"What is the peculiar process of\r\nimparting these magnetisms?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes by conversation,--sometimes by the contact of hands,--perhaps\r\nby a kiss; no rule is laid down; the process must depend upon the kind of\r\nmagnetism to be imparted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very naturally. But what have I to do with all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you. I was not Susan's first choice; but you were. That fact\r\nis very significant; it shows an affinity. And what I desire is, that--\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear John Henry,\" I interrupted, \"allow me to say that you are quite\r\nmistaken. If I know any thing of affinities, there is none between Susan\r\nand myself; no more, I judge, than there is between you and the gentleman I\r\nmet going out, as I was coming in.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,--Clodman! You saw him?\" cried Pendlam.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and remember distinctly seeing him at least twice before; once as the\r\nPractical Organizer of the Initial Association of Free Disciples, and once\r\nas the self-appointed castigator of unfortunate temperance missionaries.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are pleased to be sarcastic,\" said Pendlam, mildly. \"He is a very\r\nuseful man to us. I welcome his visits to my house; for I consider his\r\nmagnetism highly beneficial to Susan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, by all the gods at once, you wrong me!\" I said. \"If that man's\r\nmagnetism is what she needs, to suppose that mine is, also, is an insult. I\r\nlose patience with you, O most free Disciple!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" replied Pendlam, with a smile, \"you have not yet reached the plane\r\nof perfect freedom. I cannot argue with you; but when you have had certain\r\nnecessary experiences, and arrived at my stand-point, you will see as I\r\ndo.\"\r\n\r\nHe conducted me to the door, rather coolly. I stopped a moment to speak to\r\nSusan.\r\n\r\n\"For the love of Heaven,\" I said, \"remember what I told you. You don't know\r\nhow much depends upon you!\"\r\n\r\nSusan stared. I left her staring.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Miss Kellerton returned, and played a brilliant engagement.\r\nI accompanied Horatio one evening to witness her fourth appearance in a\r\nnew play, which had taken the theatrical portion of the city by storm.\r\nThe play-house was packed from top to bottom. We had our seats in the\r\norchestra, where we enjoyed a view of both actors and audience, and a cool\r\nbreeze from behind the scenes. For criticisms of the performance, I must\r\nrefer the reader to the newspapers of the period. Horatio cheered like a\r\nmadman. He was quite beside himself with enthusiasm, especially at the\r\nclose of the third act. He was clapping furiously, and looking about upon\r\nthe audience to see who else was cheering, when he suddenly stopped, his\r\nhands asunder, his countenance transfixed with an alarming expression. I\r\nthought he had clapped himself into a fit.\r\n\r\n\"Horatio!\" I cried,--\"Horatio! what's the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look! look!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yonder! by the pillar!\" I now thought (his head being turned) that\r\nperchance he beheld a ghost. \"Don't you see?--Pendlam!\"\r\n\r\nIt was true;--there sat the reformer, out-cheering Horatio himself! By\r\nhis side was Susan, looking brighter and happier than I had seen her for\r\nmonths. By _her_ side sat--\r\n\r\n\"That rascal Clodman!\" hissed Horatio, through his teeth.\r\n\r\nMiss Kellerton came before the curtain. A vast tumult of applause burst\r\nforth and died away. Pendlam cheered after all the rest had ceased. Then\r\nhe and Clodman conferred,--the face of the latter so near Susan's, as he\r\nleaned before her, that Horatio swore he kissed her. Both Pendlam and Susan\r\nwere beaming with smiles.\r\n\r\n\"This recreation will do them good,\" I whispered.\r\n\r\n\"That Clodman is a villain!\" muttered Horatio. \"Ask Miss Kellerton; she\r\nknows him. But, villainy aside, what a stupendous joke it is to see Pendlam\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\nHoratio arose, flushed and excited.\r\n\r\n\"Where are you going?\" I demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you soon. Let me pass.\"\r\n\r\nHe left the theatre. I did not see him again until the play was over. He\r\nmade his way to the orchestra box where I sat, in time to applaud Miss\r\nKellerton's final appearance before the curtain. Then he grasped my arm.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me; they are going!\"\r\n\r\nHe indicated Pendlam's party. We passed up the aisle, reached the hall, and\r\nwaited for them at the foot of the stairs. Presently they appeared. Clodman\r\nwas praising the performance; Susan expressed her delight; Pendlam said\r\nsomething about miscellaneous magnetisms. They had reached the foot of\r\nthe stairs, when Horatio sprang upon them like a brigand, and seized John\r\nHenry's collar.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! Horatio!\" gasped Pendlam, a good deal startled.\r\n\r\n\"Too late to escape!\" And Horatio drew a tract upon him, like a revolver.\r\n\"Here is something, sir, which I think will suit your case,\" levelling it at\r\nPendlam's throat.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" stammered Pendlam, reading the title, \"'The Theatre a Stronghold of\r\nVice; a Sermon, by--'\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Reverend John Henry Pendlam,\" roared out Horatio. \"Pendlam, the\r\ndistinguished temperance-preacher!\"\r\n\r\nA lurid smile played over the grim features of the Practical Organizer.\r\n\r\n\"Pendlam has outgrown his former opinions,\" he said, with a look of hate at\r\nHoratio.\r\n\r\n\"Not precisely,\" said Pendlam. \"I have simply enlarged them, or rather\r\nadded to them. I preach temperance the same; but every man must be his own\r\nmaster. The vices of the theatre appear just as hideous to me as ever; but\r\nthe theatre itself may be redeemed, and made an instrument of salvation. As\r\nthe patronage of bad people rendered it what it has been, so the patronage\r\nof the good is required to make it what it should be. The divine magnetism\r\nof a few spiritual persons in the audience must necessarily affect, not\r\nonly the remainder of the audience, but also the actors. In our new\r\nAssociation--\"\r\n\r\n\"Come!\" growled the Practical Organizer, turning away, with Susan leaning\r\nconfidingly on his arm; \"shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Excuse me. I will give you my ideas of a spiritual drama another time.\r\nI'll take this sermon. I shall read with interest what I had to say on the\r\nsubject before my mind had attained its present plane. Good night! You see\r\nwhere I am,\" added Pendlam.\r\n\r\nThenceforward the Pendlams were frequent visitors at the theatres. When\r\nJohn Henry was too much occupied to attend, Clodman had the gallantry to\r\nescort Susan. This was considered exceedingly kind in Clodman; he not only\r\ntreated Susan to delightful dramatic performances, but at the same time\r\nimparted to her his valuable magnetism.\r\n\r\nOne Sabbath evening Horatio came suddenly upon me in the street, and pulled\r\nme breathlessly around a corner.\r\n\r\n\"Wait till I can speak; the miracle of miracles! I have been to--to call on\r\nHER; and who do you suppose had been dining with her?\"\r\n\r\nI named successively several noted actress-hunters and snobs, whose names\r\ndisgusted Horatio. \"Who then?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"Pendlam! Pendlam! Pendlam!\" ejaculated Horatio. \"He wanted to consult HER\r\nupon the subject of creating a Divine Drama, or some such nonsense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly a new Divine Comedy,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\n\"She made him stay and dine on Sunday! And will you believe it?--he\r\nfinds her magnetic impartations, as he calls them, highly agreeable and\r\nadvantageous to his constitution! Bless him! he isn't the first man who has\r\nfound them agreeable, if not so advantageous. But she gave him a dose!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of bitter truth about Clodman. She knows him for a villain, and told him\r\nso. I was there, and glad to hear it. But I was enraged. I could have\r\nwrung John Henry Pendlam's neck for him, when he said, with his quiet,\r\ncharitable, mild, incredulous smile, that he was already aware there\r\nexisted in the community _a good deal of prejudice_ against Clodman!\"\r\n\r\nMatters were now progressing rapidly to a crisis. One day during the\r\nensuing summer, I asked Horatio the usual question, \"Where is Pendlam\r\nnow?\"--referring, as John Henry himself would have said, not to locality,\r\nbut condition.\r\n\r\n\"That is impossible to say,\" replied Horatio, \"for I have not seen him\r\nsince yesterday. Then he was situated opposite a bottle of pale sherry,\r\nwhich that rascal Clodman had just brought to the house. They were\r\ndrinking, and talking over the Organization of Free Disciples. Several\r\nwealthy men have become interested in the enterprise, and large amounts\r\nhave been subscribed. Pendlam is writing a work on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Susan?\"\r\n\r\n\"Her child is sick, and claims all her attention. They are trying to cure\r\nit with magnetisms. Clodman is day and night at the house; his magnetism\r\nbeing considered indispensable for the restoration of the child.\"\r\n\r\nA month later, Horatio brought me word that the child was dead.\r\n\r\nAnother month, and I learned that Susan had been sent to some celebrated\r\nWestern Magnetic Springs for her health.\r\n\r\n\"How did she go?\"\r\n\r\nHoratio hesitated. \"I am sorry to say she has gone with that rascal\r\nClodman, who is travelling on business for the Association. Pendlam remains\r\nat home, hard at work on his book. I will now add what I did not wish you\r\nto know,\" said Horatio. \"For some months Pendlam's family subsisted almost\r\nentirely upon funds advanced him by that rascal Clodman. They talk of\r\nhis wonderful generosity! But the villain has a wife of his own, and a\r\ncouple of young children, who are left to suffer for want of the actual\r\nnecessaries of life. Pendlam has given up preaching, you know, in order to\r\ndevote himself entirely to the Association.\"\r\n\r\n\"Horatio, I am afraid that all is lost. I did hope better things of Susan.\r\nWretched, wretched girl!\"\r\n\r\nTears came into Horatio's eyes. \"How could the damnable thing ever happen?\"\r\nhe exclaimed, passionately. \"She was a true, honest girl; and Pendlam is\r\nnot a bad man.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a man,\" I said, \"who verily thinketh no evil. He has imagination,\r\nintellect, spirituality; but he wants balance. From the first, I saw that\r\nhis powers needed centralizing. He had no hold upon integral truth, but\r\nsnatched here a fragment and there a fragment. Always distrust that man,\r\nHoratio, that talks forever of planes, and stand-points, and step-by-step\r\nprocesses, and deems it necessary to inform you each day where he stands.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what could have saved him!\" sighed Horatio.\r\n\r\n\"I know what could; an entire and absorbing love. His wife should have been\r\none towards whom all his thoughts and sympathies would have been drawn.\r\nSuch a love would have given him concentration, poise, unity. But, on the\r\nother hand, his heart had no anchor, and his intellect was left adrift. He\r\nhas pursued truth, forgetting that truth is a tree, one and mighty, but\r\nwith innumerable branches; and that it is unsafe to risk the weight of\r\none's salvation upon a single bough. Susan had no part in his life; she\r\nwas left with that hungry, yearning heart, until the sympathy even of a\r\nClodman seemed food to her perishing nature. Pity her, Horatio, but do not\r\ncondemn.\"\r\n\r\nThe Initial Association failed. Clodman did not return; and it was found\r\nthat he had appropriated to his private use the funds of the Association.\r\nBehind him he had left a distressed family, and many creditors. Where was\r\nSusan?\r\n\r\nI now thought it time to hunt up Pendlam. After no little search, I was\r\nsent to an obscure lodging. I opened the door pointed out to me, and\r\nentered an extraordinary chamber. The sides were covered with strange\r\ndiagrams, grotesque drawings, lettered inscriptions. Some were sketched\r\nrudely upon the plastering with colored chalk; others were designed\r\nupon paper, and pasted on the wall. In the centre of the room sat an\r\nindescribable human figure, with its face buried in its hands. It wore an\r\nanomalous garment, slashed with various colors, like a harlequin's coat.\r\nUpon one shoulder was sewed the semblance of a door cut out of blue cloth;\r\non the other, a crescent cut out of green. Upon the head was set a tinsel\r\ncrown, amid tangles of disordered hair. Above was a huge brass key,\r\nsuspended by a tow string from the ceiling. Table and floor were littered\r\nwith manuscripts and papers; under the former I observed an empty bottle.\r\n\r\nI spoke. The figure started, and looked up. In the sallow cheeks, untrimmed\r\nbeard, sunken and encircled eyes, I recognized Pendlam. A quick flush\r\nspread over his haggard features, and he made a snatch at his tinsel crown.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be disturbed,\" I entreated.\r\n\r\nHe smiled, but with an air of embarrassment; and leaving the tinsel upon\r\nhis uncombed head, pointed to the wall.\r\n\r\n\"You see where I am,\" said Pendlam.\r\n\r\n\"I see, yet do _not_ see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have reached the plane of symbols. You are aware that there is something\r\nin symbols?\"\r\n\r\n\"A great deal! a great deal!\" I said, from a sorrowful heart, as I glanced\r\naround me.\r\n\r\nPendlam, who had spoken doubtingly, seemed encouraged.\r\n\r\n\"Symbols are the highest expression of spiritual thought. Both words and\r\npictures are used. They are the language of the spirit, which only the same\r\nspirit can understand. Look here, and you will see some symbols of a very\r\nastonishing character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Astonishing,\" said I, \"is a mild word!\"\r\n\r\n\"And what is equally astonishing,\" added the eager reformer, \"is the\r\nmanner in which they are produced. The hand is moved to write or draw them\r\nspontaneously. The symbol comes first, the interpretation afterwards. Here\r\nis a vulture soaring away with a lamb. It has a meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"A deep meaning!\" I added. \"We have known such a vulture!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" he cried,--too excited to heed any words but his own,--\"are swine\r\nfeeding upon golden fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the swine! Oh, the precious, wasted, golden fruit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is one in words; it reads, _Beware of falling from a balloon_. It\r\nrequires a peculiar experience,\" added Pendlam, with a smile, \"to enable\r\none to understand that beautiful symbol.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I have not had the requisite experience; but\"--I laid my hand on\r\nPendlam's shoulder--\"I know a man who has fallen from several balloons!\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is one,\" said Pendlam, turning to the table, \"which I have just\r\ndrawn. I was trying to get at its meaning when you came in.\" He showed me a\r\nsketch consisting of a number of zigzag lines, joined one to another, and\r\ntending towards a circle.\r\n\r\n\"My dear John Henry,\" said I, \"any person who has watched your course for\r\nthe last four or five years will readily see the meaning of that symbol. It\r\nis a map of your voyage of discoveries.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such tacking and shifting?\" queried Pendlam, with a smile commiserating my\r\nignorance.\r\n\r\n\"Just such tacking and shifting. If you had possessed a good compass, it\r\nwould have shown you.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam caught at the word compass. \"It is singular;--you must have some\r\nspiritual perception;--it was written through my hand nine days ago,\r\n_Purchase a compass_. Here is the writing; I placed it upon the wall as a\r\nsymbol; and I have intended buying a compass as soon as I could get the\r\nmeans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, John Henry,\" said I, \"there is more in your symbols than you suppose.\r\nYou want no purchasable compass.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam rewarded my simplicity with another pitying smile.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, \"you who know so much of symbols, explain this. _Avoid the\r\nshores of Old Spain_. I have not yet penetrated its meaning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave it,\" I replied, \"with the unexplained Pythagorean symbol touching\r\nabstinence from beans. Perhaps future events will reveal it.\"\r\n\r\nPendlam smiled as before. But was I not right? Did not lamentable events in\r\nthe not far-off future give to the symbol a melancholy significance?\r\n\r\n\"Come,\" I said, \"leave these abstruse studies; take off that symbolic coat,\r\nthat tinsel crown; wash, comb your hair, and walk with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should enjoy a walk,\" replied Pendlam; \"but I am directed to retain\r\nthese symbols upon my person, and you would hardly wish me to appear in the\r\nstreet with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Directed!--by what authority?\"\r\n\r\n\"By the Spirit. Some beautiful use is to be fulfilled. I see where you\r\nare,\" added Pendlam;--\"from your stand-point it must look absurd enough.\"\r\n\r\nI sat down, and endeavoured to reason with him. But I found it impossible\r\nfor a person upon my plane to reach with any argument a person upon his. In\r\nvain I recapitulated his successive trials and failures.\r\n\r\n\"It is true,\" he confessed, \"I have been called to pass through some\r\nstrange experiences. But all were necessary steps; and I have now reached\r\na stand-point from which I can look back and see in its indisputable\r\nplace every grade of the progressive ascent. There has been only apparent\r\nfailure. Our attempted Association was a necessary foreshadowing of what\r\nremains to be unfolded; a prophetic symbol. We have all been taught great\r\nlessons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the vulture and the lamb!\" I said, sternly; \"where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"I perceive,\" answered Pendlam, charitably, \"you do not understand.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is you,\" I cried, \"who have failed to understand your own symbols.\r\nTo use plain language, then, where is Susan? She is the lamb that was\r\nentrusted to your keeping, and that you suffered the obscene bird to carry\r\naway!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are pleased to employ harsh terms,\" said Pendlam, meekly. \"Susan has\r\ndone well; she has followed her attractions, and that is obedience to the\r\nSpirit. Perfect freedom is essential to progression. Consequently, above\r\na certain plane, monogamy, which has undeniable primitive uses, ceases to\r\nexist. The laws of chemical affinity teach this by analogy. When the mutual\r\nimpartations which result from the conjunction of positive and negative\r\nhave blended in a state of equilibrium, there is consequent repulsion, and\r\nthe law of harmonies ordains new combinations. You see where I am,\" said\r\nPendlam.\r\n\r\nDisheartened and sorrowful, I set out to go. At the door I turned back.\r\n\r\n\"Can I do anything for you, John Henry?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless\"--Pendlam hesitated a moment--\"if you have a dollar to spare?\"\r\n\r\nI gave him a bank-bill. As he leaned forward to receive it, he struck his\r\nhead against the suspended key.\r\n\r\n\"Another symbol,\" I said. _\"Break not your brains upon the key of brass.\"_\r\n\r\nHe scratched his head, rearranged his tinsel, and smiling, advanced to show\r\nme the stairs. I looked back once: there crowned he stood, in his symbolic\r\ncoat, with the green crescent and blue door on the shoulders; and as a gust\r\nfrom the stairway blew open the garment, I beheld a great yellow heart on\r\nhis breast. That picture remained impressed upon my vision. In the street,\r\nI recalled the room, the drawings, the inscriptions,--all so tragical and\r\nsaddening! I had not proceeded far, when, moved by greater compassion, I\r\nturned and retraced my steps. At the door of the house, I saw the servant\r\ngirl who had admitted me coming out with a bottle, and thought it the same\r\nI had seen lying empty under Pendlam's table. I followed her into a grocery\r\non the corner. She called for gin, and paid for it out of my bank-bill.\r\n\r\nI now changed my mind, and went to consult Horatio. It was concluded that\r\nPendlam's old habits of thought and associations ought to be entirely\r\nbroken up. Deserted, destitute, dependent, he condescended, after long\r\nholding out against us, to listen to what we proposed. Hearing of a vacancy\r\nin a newspaper office in a western city, we had procured for him the\r\nsituation. Not without a struggle, he consented to accept it, abandoned his\r\ndarling reformatory projects, and set out for his new sphere.\r\n\r\nHis position was that of subordinate writer; and for a time he maintained\r\nit with considerable ability. But he grew restless under restraint; and at\r\nlength, taking advantage of the managing editor's absence, he published\r\narticles on prohibited subjects, which lost the paper half its subscribers,\r\nand him his situation. When next heard of, he was gaining a meagre\r\nsubsistence by writing theatrical puffs,--employment for which he was\r\nindebted to the kindness of a certain influential actress named Kellerton.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Susan returned from her unhappy wanderings; and her\r\nmother's family, seizing upon her like wolves, hid her from the world in\r\ntheir den. And I was pleased not long after to read that an individual\r\nnamed Clodman, a noted swindler, had recently been shot in a street-fight\r\nin St. Louis, by a husband whose domestic peace he had disturbed.\r\n\r\nThe last word of all, that ends this strange, eventful, and, alas! too true\r\nhistory, remains to be said.\r\n\r\nFor some months, we had heard nothing of Pendlam. But last week I received\r\na bundle of Roman Catholic publications, one of which contained an article\r\nproclaiming a miraculous conversion of the distinguished reformer, and\r\nthereby greatly glorifying Catholicism.\r\n\r\nThe same mail brought me a letter from the convert.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" he wrote, \"I have found peace in the bosom of the Holy Catholic\r\nChurch. All my previous experiences were necessary to lead me where I am.\r\nThis is the divine association I was so long seeking elsewhere in vain;\r\nI find in its forms the true symbols of a universal religion; and I now\r\nperceive that the seeming errors, in which I was for a time permitted to\r\nstray, were wisely designed to convince me of the sublime truth, that\r\ncelibacy is the single condition befitting a holy apostolic teacher.\"\r\n\r\nAmid the flood of reflections that rushed upon me, arose prominent the\r\nimage of poor Pendlam's unexplained symbol: \"_Avoid the shores of old\r\nSpain._\" Had it not now received its interpretation? The tossed voyager,\r\nfailing to make the continent of truth, but beating hither and thither amid\r\nthe reefs and breakers of dangerous coasts, mistaking many islands for the\r\nmain, and drifting on unknown seas, had at last steered straight to the old\r\nCatholic shores, from which the great discoverers had sailed so many years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH INDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe year 1757 was one of the gloomiest ever known to England. At home, the\r\ngovernment was in a state of utter confusion, though the country was at war\r\nwith France, and France was in alliance with Austria; these two nations\r\nhaving departed from their policy of two centuries and a half, in order\r\nthat they might crush Frederic of Prussia, England's ally. Frederic was\r\ndefeated at Kolin, by the Austrians, on the 18th of June, and a Russian\r\narmy was in possession of East Prussia. A German army in British pay,\r\nand commanded by the \"Butcher\" hero of Culloden, was beaten in July, and\r\ncapitulated in September. In America, the pusillanimity of the English\r\ncommanders led to terrible disasters, among which the loss of Fort William\r\nHenry, and the massacre of its garrison, were conspicuous events. In India,\r\nthe English were engaged in a doubtful contest with the viceroy of Bengal,\r\nwho was supported by the French. Even the navy of England appeared at\r\nthat time to have lost its sense of superiority; for not only had Admiral\r\nByng just been shot for not behaving with proper spirit, but a combined\r\nexpedition against the coast of France ended in signal failure, and Admiral\r\nHolburne declined to attack a French fleet off Louisburg. No wonder that\r\nthe British people readily believed an author who then published a work to\r\nestablish the agreeable proposition, \"that they were a race of cowards and\r\nscoundrels; that nothing could save them; that they were on the point of\r\nbeing enslaved by their enemies, and that they richly deserved their fate.\"\r\nSuch a succession of disasters might well discourage a people, some of whom\r\ncould recollect the long list of victories which commenced with Blenheim\r\nand closed with Malplaquet, and by which the arrogance of the Grand\r\nMonarque had been punished.\r\n\r\nYet it is from this very year of misfortune that the power of modern\r\nEngland must take its date. \"Adversity,\" said El Hakim to the Knight of the\r\nLeopard, \"is like the period of the former and of the latter rain,--cold,\r\ncomfortless, unfriendly to man and to animal; yet from that season\r\nhave their birth the flower and the fruit, the date, the rose, and the\r\npomegranate.\" In the summer of 1757 was formed that ministry which\r\nsucceeded in carrying England's power and glory to heights which they\r\ndid not reach even under the Protectorship of Cromwell or the rule of\r\nGodolphin. Then were commenced those measures which ended in the expulsion\r\nof the French from North America, and gave to England a territory here\r\nwhich may perpetuate her institutions for ages after they shall have ceased\r\nto be known in the mother-land. Then was America conquered in Germany, and\r\nnot only was Frederic so assisted as to be able to contend successfully\r\nagainst the three great houses of Bourbon, Habsburg, and Romanoff, and a\r\nhorde of lesser dynasties, but British armies, at Minden and Creveldt,\r\nrenewed on the fields of the continent recollections of the island skill\r\nand the island courage. Then was a new spirit breathed into the British\r\nmarine, by which it has ever since been animated, and which has seldom\r\nstopped to count odds. Then began that dashing course of enterprise which\r\ngave almost everything to England that was assailable, from Goree to Cuba,\r\nand from Cuba to the Philippines. Then was laid the foundation of that\r\nOriental dominion of England which has been the object of so much wonder,\r\nand of not a little envy; for on the 23d of June, 1757, was fought the\r\nbattle of Plassey, the first of those many Indian victories that illustrate\r\nthe names of Clive, Coote, Wellesley, Gough, Napier, and numerous other\r\nheroes. It seems odd, that the interest in Indian affairs should have been\r\nsuddenly and strangely revived in the hundredth year after the victory that\r\nlaid Bengal at the feet of an English adventurer. Had the insurgent Sepoys\r\ndelayed action but a few weeks, they might have inaugurated their movement\r\non the very centennial anniversary of the birth of British India.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing like the rule of the English in India to be found in\r\nhistory. It has been compared to the dominion which Rome held over so large\r\na portion of the world; but the comparison has not the merit of aptness.\r\nThe population of the Roman Empire, in the age of the Antonines, has been\r\nestimated at 120,000,000, including that of Italy. The population of\r\nIndia is not less than 150,000,000, without counting any portion of the\r\nconquering race. Rome was favorably situated for the maintenance of her\r\nsupremacy, as she had been for the work of conquest. Her dominion lay\r\naround the Mediterranean, which Italy pierced, looking to the East and the\r\nWest, and forming, as it were, a great place of arms, whence to subdue or\r\nto overawe the nations. Cicero called the Hellenic states and colonies a\r\nfringe on the skirts of Barbarism, and the description applies also to the\r\nRoman dominion; for though Gaul and Spain were conquered from sea to sea,\r\nand the legions were encamped on the Euphrates, and the valley of the Nile\r\nwas as submissive to the Cæsars as it had been to the Lagidse, yet the\r\nMediterranean was the basis of Roman power, and a short journey in almost\r\nany direction from it would have taken the traveller completely from\r\nunder the protection of the eagles. Not so is it with British India. From\r\nno European country is India so remote as from England. The two regions\r\nare separated by the ocean, by seas, by deserts, and by some of the most\r\npowerful nations. Their sole means of union are found in the leading cause\r\nof their separation. England owes her Indian empire to her empire of the\r\nsea. India will be hers just so long, and no longer, as she shall be able\r\nto maintain her naval supremacy. Those who predict her downfall in the\r\nEast, either as a consequence of the natives throwing off her rule, or\r\nthrough a Russian invasion, forget that she entered India from the sea,\r\nand that until she shall have been subdued on that element it would be\r\nidle to think of dispossessing her of her Oriental supremacy. Were the\r\nlong-cherished dream of Russia to be realized,--a dream that is said to\r\nhave troubled the sleep of Peter, and which certainly haunted the mind of\r\nCatharine,--and Russian proconsuls ruling on the Ganges, India could no\r\nmore be to Russia what she has been to England, than the Crimea, had he\r\nkept it, could have been to Louis Napoleon what it is to the Czar. The\r\ncondition of Indian dominion is ocean dominion.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the Indian empire of England resembles the Roman empire.\r\nThe latter comprised many and widely different countries and races, and\r\nso is it with the former. We are so accustomed to speak of India as if it\r\nconstituted one country, and were inhabited by a homogeneous people, that\r\nit is difficult to understand that not even in Europe are nations to be\r\nfound more unlike to one another than in British India. In Hindostan and\r\nthe Deccan there are ten different civilized nations, resembling each other\r\nno more than Danes resemble Italians, or Spaniards Poles. They differ in\r\nmoral, physical, and intellectual conditions,--in modes of thought and in\r\nmodes of life. This is one of the chief causes of England's supremacy,\r\njust as a similar state of things not only promoted the conquests of Rome,\r\nbut facilitated her rule after they had been made. The Emperors ruled over\r\nSyrians, Greeks, Egyptians, and other Eastern peoples, with ease, because\r\nthey had little in common, and could not combine against their conquerors.\r\nThey did the same in the West, because the inhabitants of that quarter, if\r\nleft to themselves, would have passed their time in endless quarrels. The\r\nold world abounded in great cities, all of which owned the supremacy of\r\nRome, from Gades to Thapsacus; and in modern India the most venerable\r\nplaces are compelled to bow before the upstart Calcutta.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar condition of India a hundred years since enabled the English\r\nto lay the foundations of their power in that country so broadly and so\r\ndeep that nothing short of a moral convulsion can uproot them, though the\r\nedifice erected upon them may be rudely shaken by internal revolts, or by\r\nthe consequences of external wars. Fifty years sooner or forty years later,\r\nthe English could have made no impression on India as conquerors. Seventy\r\nyears before the conquest of Bengal the English traders had been plundered\r\nby a viceroy who anticipated the tyranny of Surajah Doulah. They determined\r\nnot to submit to such exactions. They resolved upon war. But the great\r\nAurungzebe was then on the throne of Delhi; and though the Moghul empire\r\nhad declined somewhat from the standard set up by Akbar and maintained by\r\nShah Jehan, the fighting merchants were soon taught that they were but as\r\nchildren in the hands of its chief. They were driven out of Bengal, and\r\nAurungzebe thought of expelling them from his whole empire. The punishment\r\nof death was visited upon some of the East India Company's officers and\r\nservants by the Moghul. This severe lesson made a deep impression on the\r\nEnglish. They resumed their humble position as traders on sufferance. They\r\nnever thought of conquest again. It was not until every man who had been\r\nconcerned in that business had long been in his grave, that the English\r\ndared so much as to think of making another war. Though the Moghuls\r\nrapidly became powerless after the death of Aurungzebe, the blows struck\r\nby anticipation in their behalf protected them for forty years against the\r\nambition of the intrusive Occidentals, and even for some time after Nadir\r\nShah's Persian invasion had demonstrated that their dynasty was as weak\r\nas that of Lodi had been found when Baber came into the land. Whether the\r\nEnglish have been right or wrong in making themselves masters of India, it\r\nis certain that they were forced upon the work against their own wishes and\r\ninclinations, and in self-defence. The very expedition which Clive made use\r\nof to effect the subjugation of Bengal had been undertaken on defensive\r\ngrounds; and so fearful was even that great man of the consequences of a\r\nunion of the forces of the Moghul with those at the command of the French\r\nin the East, that he was at first desirous of making peace with Surajah\r\nDoulah himself. When the arrival of reinforcements had induced him to\r\ntake a bolder course, and the destruction of that fierce viceroy had been\r\nresolved upon, it was not until after much doubt and hesitation, and\r\nagainst his original judgment, that that course of action was entered upon\r\nwhich ended in the victory of Plassey. He knew the risk that was run in\r\nfighting a pitched battle against a force nearly twenty times larger than\r\nhis own; and had the viceroy been either a respectable ruler or a good\r\nsoldier, the English, humanly speaking, must have then failed as signally\r\nas their predecessors of 1687; but as he was as destitute of humanity as of\r\ncourage and skill, and could neither animate his followers by affection nor\r\ncommand them by force of character, he was utterly routed. Not six hundred\r\nmen fell in the battle of Plassey, on both sides, and most of these were on\r\nthe side of the vanquished. Seldom has it happened that so mighty a change\r\nhas been effected with so little slaughter. One is reminded of the battles\r\nfought by the few Romans under Lucullus against the entire array of the\r\nArmenian monarchy.\r\n\r\nHad circumstances not led to the display of British power at the time when\r\ngreat prizes were sure to follow even from minor exertions, England never\r\ncould have become mistress of India. Had the English remained traders\r\nforty years longer,--or even for half that time, perhaps,--they would have\r\nencountered very different foes from those which they overthrew so easily\r\nwhen forced to fight for property and life. India was breaking up in 1757,\r\nand the process of reformation was about to begin. Had not the English been\r\nbrought into the vast arena, either a number of powerful monarchies would\r\nhave been formed, or the whole country would have passed under some new\r\ndynasty, which would have revived the power of the state with that rapidity\r\nwhich is so often exhibited in the East, when new and able men assume the\r\nreins of government. Hyder Ali might have made himself the master of all\r\nIndia, had it been his lot to contend only with native rulers and native\r\nraces. Had this been the course of events, and had circumstances brought\r\nhim into collision with the East India Company when he had made himself the\r\nMoghul's successor, can it be believed that he would have experienced any\r\nmore difficulty in dealing with them than was found by Aurungzebe? We know\r\nthat the English found in Hyder a very able foe, with but limited means\r\nat his disposal, and when they were masters of half the country, and had\r\nbeen almost uniformly victorious. Can it be supposed that they could have\r\neffected anything against all India, ruled by so consummate a statesman as\r\nHyder Ali? There seems to have been something providential in the events\r\nthat caused them to pass from traders to conquerors, at the only time when\r\nsuch a transition could be made either with safety or success. That their\r\ncareer of conquest has been occasionally marked by injustice and crime\r\nproves nothing against the position that they may have been appointed by\r\na higher Power to work out a revolution in the East. \"The dark mystery\r\nof the moral world,\" in this as in a thousand other instances, remains\r\nimpenetrable. Heaven selects its own agents, and all that it becomes us to\r\nsay concerning such relations is, that they do not appear in all cases to\r\nbe made from among men specially entitled to the honors of canonisation.\r\n\r\nThe English have frequently been denounced, not only for their errors in\r\ngoverning India, but for their conquest of that country. The French have\r\nbeen especially fervent in these denunciations. It is a fact, however, that\r\nthe French saw nothing wrong in subduing India until all their own plans\r\nto that end had utterly failed. The device originated with them, but the\r\nEnglish applied it. Dupleix planned for France what Clive executed for\r\nEngland. The French adhered to their plans for years, and it was not until\r\na very recent period that the last remnants of their influence disappeared\r\nfrom India. They saw not the evil involved in the overthrowing of virtuous\r\nnabobs and venerable viceroys, until time and a whole train of events had\r\nproved that England alone was competent to the full performance of the\r\nwork. The English in India have not, on all occasions, been saints; but we\r\nare unable to see what moral right the French have to reproach them with\r\nthe enumeration of their errors. In the East, France was \"overcrowed\" by\r\nEngland; and that is the sole and the very simple cause of the vast amount\r\nof \"sympathy\" which the French have bestowed upon suffering Indian princes,\r\nwhose condition in no sense would have been improved, had fortune favored\r\nthe Gallic race, instead of the Saxon, in their struggle for supremacy in\r\nHindostan.\r\n\r\nThe prejudice that exists in many minds against England, concerning her\r\nIndian empire, is in no small degree owing to something of which she is\r\njustly proud; to the talent that characterized the prosecution--his friends\r\ncalled it the persecution--of Warren Hastings. No man, not even Strafford,\r\nwhen borne down by the whole weight of the country party in the first\r\nsession of the Long Parliament, ever encountered so able a host as that\r\nwhich set itself to effect the ruin of the great British proconsul. He\r\nwas acquitted by his judges, but he stands blackened forever on the most\r\nmagnificent pages of his country's eloquence. Burke's speeches are yet read\r\neverywhere; and to Burke, Hastings was the principle of Evil incarnate.\r\nThe two great divisions of civilized mankind hold Burke in lasting\r\nremembrance,--the liberals for his labors in the early part of his life,\r\nand the conservatives for his writings against the French Revolution; and\r\nit is impossible to admire him without condemning Hastings. It is equally\r\nimpossible to condemn Hastings without condemning the nation for which he\r\nperformed deeds so vicious and cruel, and which formally acquitted him of\r\neach and every charge preferred by Burke and his immortal associates, in\r\nthe name of the Commons of England. Even those charges were the result, not\r\nof conscientious conviction on the part of the Commons, but of Mr. Pitt's\r\ndetermination to crush one who promised to become a formidable political\r\nrival. The arguments and eloquence of such men as Burke, Fox, Sheridan, and\r\nGrey, constitute a splendid armory, from which the enemies of England can\r\nforever draw admirable weapons with which to assail her Indian policy; and\r\nthey have not been backward in making use of this mighty advantage. No one,\r\nwho has ever sought to defend England's course in the East, but has had\r\nexperience of the difficulties which those great men have placed in the\r\nway of a successful vindication of their country's cause. Either they were\r\nhonest, or they were not. If honest, what shall be said of the nation which\r\nwould not listen to them? If dishonest, what are we to think of men, the\r\nfirst statesmen of their age, who, for mere party ends, had persecuted to\r\nhis ruin one who was in no respect their inferior, and who had saved India\r\nfor England? Our own opinion is that Burke and his associates were honest,\r\nand that the only dishonest men in the prosecuting party were William Pitt\r\nand Henry Dundas,--the first being chief minister, and the other second\r\nonly to the premier himself in the government. Pitt talked much of his\r\nconscience, after having absolved Hastings on the very worst of the charges\r\nthat had been preferred against him, and then condemned him on lighter\r\ncharges. When Roger Wildrake heard the landlord at Windsor talk much of\r\nhis conscience, he was led to observe that his measures were less and his\r\ncharges larger than they had been in those earlier times when sin was\r\nallowed to take its natural course. It was so with Pitt, who was guilty\r\nof gross injustice, according to his own arguments, and then threw his\r\nconscience into the scale against the accused party, when he saw that\r\nthat party's acquittal would probably lead to his being converted into a\r\nsuccessful political rival. Hastings deserved severe censure, and no light\r\npunishment, for some of his deeds; but not even Burke would have condemned\r\nhim to the slow torture to which he was sentenced by one who believed\r\nhim to be innocent, and the object of party persecution. But the nice\r\ndistinctions which Englishmen and Americans can make in the cause and\r\ncourse of this famous state trial, because they live in the very atmosphere\r\nof party politics, are utterly unknown to the men of continental Europe;\r\nand until the end of time, England will be condemned out of the mouths of\r\nher most brilliant sons, whenever her foes--and she is too great not to\r\nhave many and bitter foes--shall discuss the history of her Indian empire.\r\n\r\nEvery nation condemns conquest, and every nation with power to enter upon\r\na career of conquest rushes eagerly upon it. The harshest condemnation\r\nthat has visited England because of her Indian successes has proceeded\r\nfrom nations who have never been backward in seizing the lands of other\r\nnations. She has been stigmatized as a usurper, and as having destroyed the\r\nindependence of Indian states. The facts do not warrant these charges. She\r\nhas rarely had a contest with any power which was not as much an intruder\r\nin India as herself. The Moghul dynasty was as foreign to India as the\r\nEast India Company, or the house of Hanover; and the viceroys sent to\r\nrule over its vast and populous provinces had the same bases of power as\r\nwere possessed by Clive, and Hastings, and Wellesley, and Bentinck, and\r\nEllenborough, and Dalhousie. The Moghuls obtained Indian dominion by\r\nconquests that were rendered easy by Indian troubles; and this is precisely\r\nthe history of England's Oriental dominion. What difference there is, is\r\nfavorable to England. The Moghuls were deliberate invaders of India; the\r\nfounder of that dynasty being an adventurer who sought an empire sword in\r\nhand, and won it by violence which no man had provoked. Baber was to India\r\nwhat the Norman William was to England. He long contemplated the conquest\r\nof the country, showing a wolf-like perseverance in hunting down his prey.\r\nFor two-and-twenty years he had his object in view, and invaded India five\r\ntimes before he obtained the throne of Delhi. The English were forced to\r\nassume the part of conquerors, and would gladly have remained traders.\r\nThey did not commence their military career until the Moghul had become a\r\nmere shadow, and when that potentate was altogether unable to protect them\r\nagainst the tyrannical practices of his lieutenants. They had to choose\r\nbetween war and extermination, and they belonged to a race which never\r\nhesitates when forced to make such a choice. Their wars were waged with the\r\nMoghul's viceroys, who were aiming at the foundation of dynastic rule, each\r\nin his own government, or with other princes, who were equally usurpers\r\nwith those viceroys, the Mahratta chiefs, for example, and Hyder Ali.\r\nOne war led to another, in all of which the English were victorious,\r\nuntil their power extended itself over all India. In one hundred and six\r\nyears--dating from the capture of Madras by the French in 1746, which event\r\nmust be taken as the commencement of their military career in India, and\r\nclosing with the annexation of Pegu, December 28, 1852,--they had completed\r\ntheir work. That, in the course of operations so mighty, and relating to\r\nthe condition of so many millions of people, they were sometimes guilty of\r\nacts of singular injustice, is true, and might be inferred, if there were\r\nno facts upon which to base the charge. It is impossible that it should\r\nhave been otherwise, considering the nature of man, and the character of\r\nmany of the instruments by which great enterprises are accomplished. But we\r\nthink it may safely be said, that never was there a career of conquest of\r\nsuch extent accompanied with so little of wrong and suffering to the body\r\nof the people. As against the wrong that was perpetrated, and the suffering\r\nthat was inseparable from wars so numerous and long-continued, are to be\r\nset the reign of order and law, under which the mass of the inhabitants\r\nhave been able to cultivate their fields in quiet, and with the assurance\r\nthat they should reap where they had sowed, undisturbed by the incursions\r\nof robber-bands. The cessation of the Mahratta invasions alone is an ample\r\ncompensation for whatever of evil may have marked the course of British\r\nconquest. The stop that has been put to the cruelties of the native rulers\r\nought not to be forgotten in estimating the amount of evil and of good\r\nwhich that conquest has brought upon India. The world has been shocked by\r\nthe cruelties of which the rebellious Sepoys have been guilty; but they\r\ncan astonish no one who is familiar with the history of the races to which\r\nthese mutineers belong. An indifference to life, and a love of cruelty for\r\ncruelty's sake, are common characteristics of most of the Orientals, and\r\nare chiefly conspicuous in the ruling classes. The reader of Indian history\r\nsickens over details compared with which all that is told of the horrors\r\nof the Black Hole of Calcutta is tame and common-place. The English have\r\nprevented repetitions of those outrages on humanity, wherever it has been\r\nin their power to coerce the princes. They have pared the claws and drawn\r\nthe teeth of these human tigers. They have acted humanely; yet it may be\r\ndoubted if they would not have consulted their own immediate interests more\r\nclosely, if they had acted the part of tyrants rather than of protectors.\r\nBy ruling through the princes, and allowing them to act as \"middle-men,\"\r\nthey would have been less troubled with mutinies, and could have amassed\r\ngreater sums of money. It is to their credit that they have pursued\r\nthe nobler course; nor ought they to repent of it even in the midst of\r\ndisasters brought upon them, we are firmly convinced, as much by the\r\nmildness of their rule as by any other cause that can be mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is yet too early to attempt to account for the rebellion of the Bengal\r\narmy. That rebellion took the world by surprise, and nowhere more so, it\r\nwould seem, than in England. A remarkable proof of this is to be found in\r\nthe tone and language of the debate that took place in the British House of\r\nCommons on the 27th of July, in which Mr. Disraeli, Lord Palmerston, Lord\r\nJohn Russell, Mr. Whiteside, Mr. T. Baring, Sir T.E. Perry, Mr. Mangles,\r\nMr. Vernon Smith, and others, participated. That debate was most lively and\r\ninteresting; and the reading of the ample report in the \"Times\" revives the\r\nrecollection of the great field-days of the English senate. Mr. Disraeli's\r\nspeech is a masterpiece, and would have done honor to times when eloquence\r\nwas far more common than it is now. Yet the conclusion to which the careful\r\nreader of the report must come is, that neither Mr. Disraeli, nor the\r\nPremier, nor the President of the Board of Control, nor the Chairman of\r\nthe Directors of the East India Company, nor any other of the speakers,\r\nhad a definite idea of the cause of the sudden mutiny of the Sepoys. It\r\nis impossible not to admire Mr. Disraeli's talents, as displayed in this\r\nspeech; and equally impossible is it to find in that speech anything that\r\nan intelligent observer of Indian affairs can regard as settling the\r\nquestion, Why did the Sepoys of the Bengal army mutiny in 1857? Everything\r\nthat he brought forward as a cause of the mutiny was distinctly proved not\r\nto be worthy of the name of a cause. Yet the men who could show that he had\r\nfailed to clear up the mystery could themselves throw no light upon it. The\r\ngovernment was especially ignorant of all that it should have known; and\r\nthere is something almost ludicrous in the tone of the speech made by the\r\nPresident of the Board of Control.\r\n\r\nIt is not for us to speak authoritatively as to the cause of the Sepoy\r\nmutiny, but we venture to express our concurrence with those who have\r\nregarded it as, in considerable measure, of Mahometan origin. The Mahometan\r\nrule was displaced by the British rule. The Mahometans were for centuries\r\nthe aristocracy of India, standing to the genuine Indians in pretty much\r\nthe same relation that the Normans held to the Saxons in England; only\r\nit is but justice to them to say, that they rarely bore themselves so\r\noffensively towards the Indians as the Normans were accustomed to bear\r\nthemselves towards the English. They have never lost the recollection of\r\ntheir former _status_, or ceased to sigh for its restoration. Nor is the\r\ntime so very remote when they were yet great in the land. Old men among\r\nthem can recollect when Tippoo Saib was treated as an equal by the English,\r\nand have not forgotten how powerful was his father, Hyder. Some few\r\naged Mussulmans there may be yet living who heard from their sires or\r\ngrandsires, who saw it with their mortal eyes, of the glories of the\r\nmagnificent Aurungzebe, ere the Persian, or the Affghan, or the Mahratta\r\nhad carried fire and sword into Shahjehanabad. Two not over-long lives\r\nwould measure the whole interval of time between the punishment of the\r\nEnglish by Aurungzebe and the mutiny at Meerut. Time enough has not yet\r\nelapsed to cause the Mahometans to forget what they have been, or to cease\r\nto hope that they may yet surpass their fathers. They are not actuated by\r\nanything of a sentimental character, but desire to win back, and to enjoy\r\nat the expense of the Indian races, the solid advantages of which they\r\nhave been deprived through the ascendency of a Christian people in the\r\nEast. \"Mahometans in India sigh for the restoration of the old Mahometan\r\n_régime_,\" says Colonel Sleeman, \"not from any particular attachment to the\r\ndescendants of Tymour, but with precisely the same feelings that Whigs and\r\nTories sigh for the return to power of their respective parties in England;\r\nit would give them all the offices in a country where office is everything.\r\nAmong them, as among ourselves, every man is disposed to rate his own\r\nabilities highly, and to have a good deal of confidence in his own good\r\nluck; and all think, that if the field were once opened to them by such a\r\nchange, they should very soon be able to find good positions for themselves\r\nand their children in it. Perhaps there are few communities in the world,\r\namong whom education is more generally diffused than among the Mahometans\r\nin India. He who holds an office worth twenty rupees a month commonly\r\ngives his sons an education equal to that of a prime-minister.\" [Footnote:\r\n_Rambles and Recollections of an Indian Official_, Vol. II. pp. 282,\r\n283.--Colonel Sleeman's work is one of the best ever published on\r\nIndia,--learned, liberal, and philosophical. It has been highly praised\r\nby so competent a judge as Mr. Grote.] This very capability for rule must\r\nrender them not only all the more desirous of obtaining it, but exceedingly\r\ndangerous as seekers after it. They are not an ignorant rabble, but men who\r\nhave an intelligent idea of what they want, and rational modes of effecting\r\nits realization. Colonel Sleeman adds, \"It is not only the desire for\r\noffice that makes the educated Mahometans cherish the recollection of\r\nthe old _régime_ in Hindostan; they say, 'We pray every night for the\r\nEmperor and his family, because our forefathers ate of the salt of His\r\nforefathers,'--that is, our ancestors were in the service of his ancestors,\r\nand consequently were of the _aristocracy_ of the country. Whether they\r\nreally were so matters not; they persuade themselves or their children that\r\nthey were.\" In this way the idea of superiority has been kept up among the\r\nMahometans of India; and they have continued to hope for the restoration\r\nof their old political supremacy, as pious Jews dream of the rebuilding of\r\nZion. That they were at the bottom of the Meerut mutiny may be taken for\r\ngranted. That they took for their leader the heir of the Moghul shows the\r\nMahometan nature of the outbreak. At the same time, we believe that if\r\nit had not been for the imbecility of Hewitt, who commanded at Meerut,\r\nthe mutiny never would have occurred, or the mutineers would have been\r\npromptly put down. Even after they had escaped from Meerut, Delhi never\r\ncould have fallen into their hands, if that city--so important, morally\r\nand geographically, as well as in a military point of view--had not\r\nbeen without a garrison. That a station of such consequence, stored so\r\nabundantly with all the munitions of war, should have been left in an\r\nutterly defenceless condition, is a fact that creates inexpressible\r\nastonishment, notwithstanding all that happened during the Russian war. Mr.\r\nWhiteside, in the debate of the 27th of July, stated that the late General\r\nSir C.J. Napier \"said of Delhi, that to guard against surprise, considering\r\nits position, its treasures, and its magazines, it should always be\r\ndefended by twelve thousand picked men.\" From all that appears, there were\r\nnot twelve hundred men, or anything like that number, of any kind, in\r\nDelhi, last May, to protect either the inhabitants or the stores there\r\ndeposited. Such another instance of neglect it would be impossible to find\r\nin history, after due warning given. Long ago, Albany Fonblanque said, \"The\r\nsign of the fool with his finger in his mouth, and the sentiment, 'Who'd\r\nhave thought it?' is the precise emblem of English jurisprudence.\" The same\r\nsign would seem to be applicable to some other branches of the English\r\npublic service, as well as to that of the law. Perhaps it was because\r\nof the warning that nothing was done,--that being the usual course with\r\ngovernments; while it was thought a duty to treat with a sort of spiteful\r\nneglect every warning that came from Sir C.J. Napier, because he had a\r\nrough, fiery way of expressing his opinion of the folly of those who are\r\nperpetually giving occasion for warnings which they never heed,--as if in\r\nall ages roughness and fire had not been especial characteristics of the\r\nprophetic office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAKIN BY MARRIAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nThe railway traveller, journeying between Springfield and Hartford along\r\nthe banks of the fair Connecticut, sees from the car window, far away to\r\nthe eastward, across the broad level of intervening plains, a chain of\r\npurple hills, whose undulating crest-line meets the bending sky and forms\r\nthe distant horizon. Just beyond the loftiest hummock of this range a\r\nfertile valley lies concealed; and near its centre, upon the smooth summit\r\nof a gently swelling ridge, which, extending north and south for miles,\r\ndivides the valley lengthwise, stands Belfield, the shire town of the rural\r\ncounty of Hillsdale. Its fourscore white dwellings, scattered unevenly\r\nalong the shady margins of a straight and ample street, are mostly large,\r\nsubstantial granges, each with its little suburb of dependencies making\r\na hamlet by itself. But where the broad avenue, at midway, spreads still\r\nwider, forming a spacious square, are thickly clustered the public\r\nbuildings of the town and county,--together with the meeting-houses, the\r\ntaverns, the bank, the shops, and a few handsome dwellings, whose large\r\ndimensions and ornate style show them to be the abodes of people of wealth\r\nand consideration.\r\n\r\nThe greensward in the middle of this square contains two or three elms of\r\nimmemorial age, besides many thrifty trees of a later planting. The wooden\r\nbarrier by which it is enclosed was once adorned with a coat of white\r\npaint, now nearly worn off. The topmost rails and post-heads of this fence\r\nhave been so notched and gnawed by the jackknives of whittling idlers\r\nand the teeth of cribbing horses, that their original size and shape are\r\nmatters concerning which the present generation are informed only by\r\ntradition.\r\n\r\nThis square was long ago named \"The Green\"; a pleasant title, by which, in\r\ncourse of time, the village itself came to be known and called. Instead of\r\ngoing \"to town,\" the farmers of the remote school districts talk of going\r\n\"to the Green,\" to meeting and to market; and in all that region the\r\nguideboards point the way \"To BELFIELD GREEN.\" This spot was the site of\r\nthe old blockhouse and stockaded fort, within whose rude but safe defences\r\nthe early colonists of Belfield, with their wives, children, and cattle,\r\nused to huddle at night, through all the time of King Philip's War. Here,\r\nwith much labor, the settlers dug a deep well, fed by never-failing\r\nsprings, to provide a sure supply of water, in case of siege, for all the\r\ngarrison. And now, as if it were a monument raised to commemorate those\r\ndismal times, there stands, at a point where all the crossing footpaths\r\nmeet, a huge town-pump, near ten feet high, carved and painted, with\r\na great ball upon its top, and an iron ladle chained to its nose. In\r\nthe torrid summer-days, from early morning till late at night, the old\r\npump-handle has but little rest; for, though in a season of drought the\r\nneighboring wells are apt to run low, the ancient pump, like a steadfast\r\nfriend, never fails at such a time of need.\r\n\r\nNear at hand, in the centre of a foot-worn circle, a stout wooden post\r\nstands by itself, which, in spite of its homely aspect, may well be termed\r\na Pillar of the State. It is one of the institutions of the Commonwealth,\r\nestablished by an act of the General Assembly. Here, with torn corners\r\nfluttering in the wind, hang weather-stained probate notices, mildewed\r\ntown-meeting warnings, and tattered placards of sheriff's sales; for no\r\nestate can be settled, no land set off or chattel sold on execution, no\r\nlegal meeting of the voters or freemen holden, without previous notice on\r\nthe sign-post. It used to be known by another name, and marks the spot,\r\nwhere, whilom, petty thieves, shiftless vagrants, and other small offenders\r\nagainst the majesty of the law, were wont to suffer a shameful penalty for\r\ntheir vile misdeeds.\r\n\r\nOn the western side of the square, on the summit of the grassy slope,\r\nstands the Presbyterian meeting-house, flanked on one side by the academy,\r\nand on the other by the court-house. There are, besides, two other places\r\nof worship in the village; but neither is built upon the square; and when,\r\nat Belfield, the meeting-house is mentioned, the speaker is understood to\r\nindicate by that title the edifice which stands between the academy and\r\nthe court-house, and not the plain, square structure, with neither steeple\r\nnor bell, in which the Baptists assemble for worship, nor the little\r\nwhite Methodist chapel in the lane, with green blinds to its windows, and\r\na little toy of a turret, scarcely bigger than a martin-box, upon its\r\nshingled roof.\r\n\r\nThe quaint style and old-fashioned aspect of Belfield meeting-house attest\r\nits venerable age. For more than a hundred years its slender spire has\r\nglowed in the ruddy beams of early dawn, and cast at sunset its lengthening\r\nshadow across the village green. A century ago, the mellow tones of its\r\nSabbath bell, echoing through the valley, summoned the pious congregation\r\nto their austere devotions. Before the worn threshold of the great\r\ndouble-leaved door, in the broadside of the building, lies a platform,\r\nwhich was once a solid shelf of red sandstone, but now is cracked in twain,\r\nand hollowed by the footsteps of six generations. In the very spot where it\r\nnow lies it has lain ever since the first framed meeting-house was built\r\nin Belfield, in the reign of good King William III. There, gathered in a\r\nlittle knot, on Sundays and public days, the forefathers of the settlement\r\nused to talk over the current news; how the first Port Royal expedition had\r\nfailed; or how New England militiamen, without aid from home, had captured\r\nthe great fortress of Louisburg, after a brief and glorious siege. There,\r\nstill later, the sons of these men rejoiced at the news of Wolfe's victory,\r\nand sorrowfully related the sad intelligence of Braddock's shameful defeat.\r\nThere stood their grandsons, a flushed, excited throng of hardy yeomen,\r\nclinching their fists unconsciously, and breathing hard and fast, as they\r\nlistened to the tidings of the fight at Concord Bridge. Here, during the\r\nwar that followed, when troops were mustered before marching off to camp,\r\nthe roll used to be called upon this very stone. No town of its size in all\r\nNew England contributed a larger number to the ranks of the Continental\r\narmy than did Belfield. One hot summer, all the unwonted toils and\r\nunbefitting cares of haying and harvest fell upon the little boys and women\r\nand a few old gray-haired men, whose aged limbs had long before earned the\r\nright to rest. In all Belfield there was not a male able to bear arms who\r\nwas not gone to camp. Some war-worn veterans lived to return; and many a\r\nSunday noon, in later years, sitting here, upon the broad doorstone of\r\nthe meeting-house, they used to tell over the stories of their battles\r\nand campaigns, until the sound from the belfry overhead, and the sight of\r\nthe minister approaching from the parsonage, with stately pace and solemn\r\naspect, would check the flowing current of their talk, and recall their\r\nthoughts to subjects more in keeping with the holy Sabbath-day. But some\r\nof the friends and comrades of these brave men never came home; their\r\nbones lie mouldering beneath the turf at White Plains, at Saratoga, at\r\nBrandywine, and at Princeton. Some perished with cold and hunger at Valley\r\nForge; some died of fever in the horrible Old Sugar-house; some rotted\r\nalive in the Jersey prison-hulk; some lie buried under the gloomy walls of\r\nDartmoor; and some there were whose fate was never known.\r\n\r\nIt was the custom, formerly, to hold all meetings for the transaction\r\nof public business in the sanctuary. None, not even the most piously\r\nfastidious parson or deacon, ever thought of being shocked at what in these\r\ndegenerate times would seem like a gross desecration of the house of God.\r\nThere were fewer Pharisees in Belfield a hundred years ago than now. To\r\nthe Puritans, and to all their descendants, until of late, their places\r\nof worship were not churches, but meeting-houses merely; and by the\r\nstout-hearted men who used to dwell in New England it would have been\r\ndeemed a heresy near akin to idolatry itself, or at least savoring strongly\r\nof the damnable errors of the Romish Church, to hold that wood and stones,\r\ncarved and fashioned by the hand of man, could be hallowed by an empty rite\r\nof consecration.\r\n\r\nOn these week-day occasions, therefore, no part of the house was kept\r\nsacred from the world. Even the pulpit itself would have been given up to\r\nsecular uses, but that, being so lofty, it was found to be an inconvenient\r\nposition for the moderator's chair. So this important functionary was\r\naccustomed, from time immemorial, to take his place in the deacons'\r\nseat, below, with the warning of the meeting, the statute-book, and the\r\nballot-boxes arranged before him on the communion-table, which in course of\r\ntime became so banged and battered, by dint of lusty gavel-strokes, that\r\nthere was scarcely a place big enough to put one's finger upon which was\r\nnot bruised and dented. For, in the days of the fierce conflict between the\r\nFederalists and Democrats, the meetings were often noisy and disorderly;\r\nand once, even, at the memorable election of 1818, two hot-headed partisans\r\nfrom sharp words fell to blows, and others joining in the fray, the\r\nskirmish became at length a general engagement. The recurrence of a scene\r\nlike this, upon the same stage, is never to be expected. The meeting-house\r\nhas been set apart for religious uses exclusively, since its interior was\r\nthoroughly altered and remodelled, the tall pulpit replaced by one of\r\nmodern style, the sounding-board removed, the aisles carpeted, and the\r\nsquare, old-fashioned pews changed for cushioned slips.\r\n\r\nIn the rear, a little way off, is a row of ugly sheds, yawning towards the\r\nstreet, where, on Sundays, the farmers who come from a distance tie their\r\nbeasts, each in his separate stall. In hot days, in the summer time, when\r\nall the doors and windows of the meeting-house are set wide open, the\r\nhollow sound of horses' stamping mingles with the preacher's drowsy tones,\r\nand sometimes the congregation is startled from repose by the shrill squeal\r\nof some unlucky brute, complaining of the torture inflicted by the sharp\r\nteeth of its ill-natured mate or vicious neighbor; or, perhaps, the flutter\r\nof fans is suspended at the obstreperous neigh by which some anxious dam\r\nrecalls the silly foal that has strayed from her side; or the dissonant\r\ncreaking of a cramped wheel makes doleful interludes between the verses of\r\nthe hymn. Here naughty boys, escaped from the confinement of the sanctuary,\r\nare wont to lounge in the wagons during prayer and sermon time, munching\r\ngreen pears and apples, devouring huge bunches of fennel, dill, and\r\ncaraway, comparing and swapping jackknives, or striving, by means of\r\ncautious hems and whispers, and other sly signals, to attract the notice of\r\ntheir more decent fellows sitting near the open gallery-windows.\r\n\r\nWhen the black doors of the little dingy building not far from the south\r\nend of the horse-sheds are seen standing open, it is a pretty sure sign\r\nthat somebody lies dead in the parish. In this gloomy place the sexton\r\nkeeps his dismal apparatus,--the hearse, with its curtains of rusty sable,\r\nthe bier, the spades and shovels for digging graves; and in a corner lies\r\na coil of soiled ropes, whose rasping sound, as they slipped through the\r\ncoffin-handles, while the bearers lowered the corpse into the earth, has\r\ngrated harshly on many a shuddering mourner's ear. The leaves of the\r\nhearse-house door are fastened together by a hasp and pin, so that any one\r\nmay enter at will. But there is no need of bolts and bars. The boys, at\r\nplay, in the evening, at \"I spy\" or \"hide and seek,\" never go there for\r\nconcealment, although their smothered whoops may be heard issuing from\r\nevery other dark corner in the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThe narrow space between the hearse-house and the sheds forms a short lane\r\nor passage-way, through which all the funeral processions pass from the\r\nstreet into the burying-ground, lying behind the sheds, on the western\r\nslope of the ridge upon which the village stands. This ancient cemetery\r\nwas laid out by the early settlers, when they made the first allotments\r\nof land. It is a square area of two acres in extent, inclosed by a mossy\r\npicket paling, so rickety that the neighbors' sheep sometimes leap through\r\nthe gaps from the adjacent pastures, and feed among the graves upon the\r\nlong grass and nettles.\r\n\r\nThe lower portion of the graveyard is set apart as a sort of\r\npotter's-field, where negroes, Indians, and stranger-paupers are buried.\r\nThis region is bordered by a little jungle of poke-berry and elder-bushes,\r\nsumachs and brambles, so dense and thrifty that they overtop and hide the\r\nfence; and there is a tradition among the school-boys, that somewhere in\r\nthe copse there is a black-snake hole, the abode of an enormous monster,\r\nupon whom no one, however, has ever happened to set eyes. Here, with but\r\nfew exceptions, the graves are marked only by low mounds of turf, overrun\r\nwith matted wild-blackberry vines, where the lightest footstep, crushing\r\nthrough the crumbling sod, destroys the labors of whole colonies of ants.\r\nBut farther up the hillside, headstones and monuments stand so close\r\ntogether, that, at a distance, there seems to be scarcely room for another\r\ngrave.\r\n\r\nNear the summit lie the early settlers of the town; and in a conspicuous\r\nplace upon the brow of the acclivity stands a row of tombstones several\r\nrods in length. These mark the graves of an ancient and honorable family\r\nof townsfolk. At one end, a thick slab of red sandstone, of uncouth shape\r\nand rude appearance, leans aslant, partly buried in the mellow soil. The\r\nmoss and lichens, with which its roughly cut back and edges are overgrown,\r\nhave been removed from its face, and the quaint inscription is distinctly\r\nlegible, whereby the curious idler is informed that \"Here lies, in y'e Hope\r\nof a Joyfull Resurrecion, y'e Body of Maj'r Iohn Bugbee, an Assistant of\r\ny'e Colony & A Iustice of y'e Peace. Born at Austerfield, in y'e County\r\nof Lincoln, England. Dyed Feb. y'e 9 AD. 1699 Æ. 72.\" Close by the side\r\nof this venerable grave is another, which the stone at its head announces\r\nto be the resting-place of \"Mistress Mindwell Bugbee--Consort of Maj'r\r\nIohn Bugbee and youngest Daut: of Sir Roger Braxley, of Braxley Hall,\r\nLincolnshire, England.\" Then follow, in order of time, the headstones\r\nwhich mark the graves of successive generations descended from this worthy\r\ncouple. Some of these are so defaced and weather-worn, that in aspect they\r\nseem even more venerable than the monuments of the founders of the race.\r\nNearly all of those erected before the beginning of the present century\r\nbear quaint devices,--some of cherubs, all wings, and blank, staring faces;\r\nsome of hour-glasses, some of masonic emblems, and upon one of two are\r\nrudely carved, ugly death's heads and crossbones. Two thirds of the way\r\ndown the line stands the first marble headstone. It is taller than its\r\nneighbors, and, though spotted with weather stains, it bears a deeply\r\ngraven inscription, which seems as legible as the day it was cut, full\r\nforty years ago. In the grave at the foot of this stone lies buried another\r\nMajor Bugbee, the great-great-grandson of the first Major. The commission\r\nof this gentleman, signed by John Hancock, President of the Continental\r\nCongress, still hangs in a frame against the wainscot, over the mantel,\r\nin the parlor of the great gambrel-roofed house, whose front-yard fence\r\nand garden palings form, for almost half the way, the eastern side of\r\nthe village square. The late master of this dwelling, Doctor Bugbee, who\r\nwas the eldest son of the Continental major, lies at the end of the long\r\nplatoon of dead, in the newest grave of all the range, over which a marble\r\nobelisk has been erected, in memory of the name and many virtues of the\r\ndeceased, who departed this life, as the inscription attests, on the 7th\r\nday of September, 1843, in the fifty-seventh year of his age.\r\n\r\nNear by this spot, with its drooping boughs shading the monument I have\r\njust described, grows a weeping-willow tree, of such great size, that its\r\ntop, from half way up, can be plainly discerned from almost every corner\r\nof the village green; and it is, withal, of such perfect symmetry of\r\nform, that on a moonlight night it resembles a fountain, as its leaves,\r\nfluttering in the breezy air, and turning their silver linings to the\r\nmoonbeams, seem to sparkle like spray and drops of falling water. Behind\r\nthis tree is placed a rustic bench, where, on a pleasant day in June, one\r\nmay sit and look forth upon as pretty a landscape as can be seen in all\r\nHillsdale County, or, for that matter, in all the State as well. Before you\r\nlies the declivity of the hill upon which the village stands. At its foot\r\nbegins a verdant plain of interval meadows, dotted here and there with\r\ngraceful elms and stately hickories, each standing alone in its ring of\r\nshadow, the turf everywhere bespangled with dandelions and buttercups, and\r\nchanging its hue from shade to shade of vivid green, as the wind sweeps\r\nover the thick growing verdure. Through these meadows flows a sluggish\r\nbrook, in broad meandering curves, crossed at each turn by rustic\r\nfarm-bridges, with clumps of trees fringing the deeper pools. The plain\r\nis skirted by a country road, bordered with majestic trees, and with\r\nfarm-houses standing all along its winding course. Beyond, the land rises,\r\nand the slope is checkered, to the foot of the hills, with arable fields.\r\nThe view is bounded by the craggy sides of the great hills which separate\r\nthis quiet vale from the broad valley of the Connecticut. Here, all is soft\r\nand tranquil beauty. But just beyond the rugged barrier of those western\r\nhills lies a grander landscape, of wide extent, through which flows New\r\nEngland's greatest river, and crossed from end to end by New England's\r\nbusiest thoroughfares, dusty with the tread of commerce, and bordered with\r\ngrowing cities and thrifty, bustling towns. Here, reclining on this rustic\r\nbench, in the shadow of the willow branches, among the tombstones of the\r\nsilent dead, you may dream away the sultry afternoon, and hear no sounds\r\nbut drowsy noises that dispose to rest and quiet; the whispering of the\r\nwind in the treetops, the droning pipe of grasshoppers and locusts,\r\nthe distant cries of teamsters to their cattle, the shouts of children\r\nloitering home from school or gathering berries in the sunny fields, the\r\nwhetting of a scythe in a far-off meadow, or the music of the blacksmith's\r\nhammer upon his ringing anvil.\r\n\r\nFour times a year, during the brief terms of court, the usual stillness\r\nthat pervades the sober village is enlivened by the presence of a scanty\r\ncrowd. Then, for a week, judges, jurors, suitors, and witnesses flock\r\ntogether; and sometimes, in the winter season, when farm work is not\r\npressing, the neighbors throng by scores into the court-house, to hear\r\nthe wordy harangues of the lawyers in some notable cause. Likewise on\r\ntown-meeting days, the stores and tavern bar-rooms about the square are\r\nfilled with a concourse of the sovereign people from the more rural\r\ndistricts; and at the annual cattle show and fair all Hillsdale comes up to\r\nBelfield. Then, I warrant you, if it chance to be a pleasant Indian-summer\r\nday, there is indeed a crowd, and for a while the little capital contains\r\na greater number of living souls than all the county besides. From early\r\ntwilight till sunset blazes on the western hills the square and street\r\nare densely thronged. A Babel of strange noises fills the dusty air: the\r\nlowing of cows and oxen; the bellowing of frightened calves; the plaintive\r\nbleating of bewildered lambs; the fierce neighing of excited horses; the\r\nyelping of curs; the crowing of imprisoned cocks, responding to each\r\nother's defiant notes; the sing-song clamor of itinerant auctioneers,\r\nstanding on their wagons and displaying their tempting wares to the little\r\nknots around them; the din and hubbub of the busy, moving, talking,\r\njostling multitude,--shouts, laughs, cries, murmurs, all mingled together,\r\ntill confusion harmonizes; and above all, the constant clanking of the iron\r\nhandle of the old town-pump, which never ceases all the livelong day. At\r\nnightfall the uproar lessens, and as the evening wanes, the unaccustomed\r\nsounds diminish, though till midnight, ever and anon, the tired and sleepy\r\ncitizens are startled from their dreams by whoops, hurrahs, snatches of\r\nsongs, and outbursts of rude laughter ringing through the frosty air and\r\nmingling with the clattering of horses' feet and the whirring rumble of\r\nswift-revolving wheels, as some party of roystering blades, excited by deep\r\npotations, drive shouting homewards from the village inns.\r\n\r\nExcepting on these unfrequent occasions, Belfield Green is as free from\r\nbustle as if it were a hamlet whose name was never seen upon a map. The\r\ntime has been, however, when it was a busy little mart, the centre of trade\r\nfor an extensive district. In yonder low-roofed store that stands upon the\r\nsquare, near by the great gambrel-roofed house of which mention has already\r\nbeen made, the second Major Bugbee increased a handsome patrimony till it\r\ngrew to be a great estate; the share of which that fell to his two eldest\r\nsons, the Doctor and his younger brother, James, they in time, by gainful\r\ntraffic in the same old place, made more than equal to the entire estate,\r\nof which a quarter only came to them. Thousands and tens of thousands of\r\ntons of golden butter and cheese, hundreds of thousands of bushels of rye,\r\noats, flaxseed, buckwheat, and corn, millions of eggs and skeins of linen\r\nand woollen yarn have been bartered at Belfield Green by the country folks,\r\nin exchange for rum, molasses, tea, coffee, salt, and codfish, enough to\r\nfreight the royal navy. Time was when folks came twenty miles to Belfield\r\npost-office, and when a dusty miller and his men, at the old red mill\r\nstanding on the brook at the foot of the valley, took toll from half the\r\ngrists in Hillsdale County. But that was long ago, when people who lived\r\ntwenty miles away from Hartford went to the city scarcely twice in a dozen\r\nyears,--in the good old days of turnpikes, stage-coaches, and wayside\r\ntaverns, before railroads were built to carry all the trade to great,\r\novergrown towns and cities. Now-a-days, as I have said, it is hard to find\r\na village of its size and rank in all the land, which is more quiet, at\r\nordinary times, than Belfield Green.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nEvery community has its quota of great men; and in this respect a country\r\nvillage is often, in proportion to its numbers, as well endowed as the\r\ncapital itself. So Belfield has her magnates whom she delights to honor.\r\nChief among them used to be numbered the late Doctor John Bugbee, a worthy\r\ngentleman, now gathered to his fathers in the ancient burying-ground behind\r\nthe meeting-house. He was not, to be sure, esteemed by all, especially the\r\nwomen, to be so great a man as the Reverend Jabez Jaynes, A.M., who, by\r\nvirtue of his sacred office and academical honors, took formal precedence\r\nof every mere layman in the parish. But with this notable exception, Doctor\r\nBugbee was the peer of every other dignitary, whether civil, military, or\r\necclesiastical, within the borders of the town.\r\n\r\nBut when I say the Doctor was a great man in Belfield, I do not mean to\r\naver, or to be understood, that, in person, he was of colossal bulk or\r\nstature; neither is it true that his intellect was of a quality so far\r\nsuperior to the average of human minds as to make him a giant in that\r\nrespect. It would be great presumption in so humble a penman as myself to\r\nchoose, even for the hero of my tale, a man of eminent distinction. So I\r\nmake haste to confess, that, doubtless, there were at least a score or two\r\nof his fellow-townsmen as well endowed by nature as the Doctor. But above\r\nmany of these persons he was elevated by accidental circumstances and\r\nacquired advantages to a position which rendered him a man of greater mark\r\nand influence than they. He was descended from a most reputable ancestry,\r\nand, being a professional man, of polite address and handsome fortune, it\r\nwould have been strange indeed, if he had not been highly esteemed in the\r\ncommunity where he dwelt. Besides, he was a man of sense and taste, witty,\r\njovial, talkative, and of such extremely easy good-nature, that, if it had\r\nnot been for the tact and shrewdness of his brother and partner in trade,\r\nwho managed the business of the firm, the Doctor's income would have\r\ndiminished, instead of increasing, as it did, year after year. As it was,\r\nhis practice as a physician scarcely paid for his horsekeeping and the\r\nmedicines he dispensed, though for a while he was a favorite physician in\r\nall that region; growing in the good-will of the people, until, as a mark\r\nof their esteem, he received a nomination to the General Assembly. At first\r\nthere was such an outcry of dismay from the old ladies of the parish, that\r\nthe Democrats came near defeating him, though the Whigs had a sure majority\r\nfor every other name on the ticket. But having triumphed over this outburst\r\nof stubborn opposition, the Doctor speedily became the most popular\r\npolitician in the county, if frequent election to office was a true test of\r\npublic favor. For it turned out, that, instead of the mortality happening,\r\nwhich the Democrats, and their allies, the old women, had predicted would\r\nprevail, there never had been known a healthier season within the memory\r\nof man. And always afterwards, whenever the worthy Doctor was chosen to\r\nrepresent the town at Hartford or New Haven, there seemed to be a special\r\ninterposition of providential mercy, inasmuch as in all his professional\r\nround, none ever sickened unto death during his absence; though it\r\nsometimes happened that the population of the town would be increased by\r\none or two. In course of time, therefore, his fame as a statesman even\r\nrivalled his reputation as physician, and all parties were brought to join\r\nin voting for him with the most cordial unanimity.\r\n\r\nIn his youth the Doctor had been reckoned a handsome young fellow, and, to\r\nthe day of his death, he preserved his good looks to a wonderful degree. A\r\ncheerful temper like his is a famous preventive of gray hairs and wrinkles.\r\nSo the jovial Doctor never seemed to grow old; and at fifty, his erect\r\nform, smooth, ruddy cheeks, curly brown poll, and merry blue eyes made him\r\nlook younger than many of his neighbors who were his juniors by a dozen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nWhen a very young man, not quite twenty years of age, and before he had\r\nfinished his course of professional study, the Doctor had taken to wife his\r\ncousin, Miss Naomi Bugbee, who had lived in his father's house ever since\r\nhe could remember; for the young lady was an orphan, with a good estate,\r\nand during her minority had been her uncle's ward. The bride was not an\r\nuncomely damsel, neither was she distinguished for beauty; and between the\r\nages of the happy young couple there was quite a difference; a circumstance\r\nby no means unusual, and which would not have been mentioned here, but\r\nfor the fact, that, in this case, it was the bride who was the senior of\r\nthe pair. Some people said she was ten years older than the Doctor; and,\r\nfor a wonder, these gossips had the evidence of the registry to back\r\ntheir statements. In fact, the youthful bridegroom had been very tenderly\r\ndry-nursed, in his infancy, by his bride; and a certain sound spanking\r\nwhich she gave him when he was just coming four, because he insisted\r\nupon crying and keeping awake, one evening, while his mother was gone\r\nto a wedding, instead of going to sleep in his trundle-bed like a good\r\nboy,--this chastisement, I say, had been one of the earliest and most vivid\r\nof the bridegroom's recollections of his childhood. But though he had not\r\nforgotten this grievance, he had doubtless forgiven it with all his heart;\r\nthereby setting an example worthy of imitation by the fair Naomi, who,\r\nindeed, was doubly bound to exercise forgiveness and forbearance towards\r\nher lord; for, whatever might have been the faults and failings of the\r\nyouth to whom she surrendered the ripened harvest of her charms, it\r\ncertainly did not lie in the mouth of one to complain of them unduly, who\r\nhad enjoyed such rare and excellent opportunities to train up for herself a\r\nhusband in the way he should go.\r\n\r\nThere was not wanting at that time in Belfield a class of spiteful people,\r\nwho, doubtless, being inspired by envy at beholding the felicity of the\r\nhappy pair, affected to laugh and sneer a good deal at what they jeeringly\r\ncalled Jack Bugbee's marrying his grandmother. But, as if it had been\r\nspecially ordered on purpose to confound these ill-natured jokers, this\r\nunion, the object of their ridicule, was most signally prospered, and in\r\ndue time the Doctor himself put his wife to bed with a pair of nice little\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nNot long after, the twins were christened at the meeting-house, a great\r\ncrowd attending to witness the ceremony. To the elder girl was given\r\nthe name of Amelia. Upon the other was bestowed the equally desirable\r\nappellative of Cornelia. While they were babies, both were considered\r\nremarkably pretty children; at least, so everybody told Mrs. Bugbee; but\r\nas they grew in years and stature, it became more and more apparent, that,\r\nalthough each resembled the other in figure, features, and expression, so\r\nstrongly that you could not see one without being reminded of the other,\r\nnone would ever be at a loss to distinguish between them; for Amelia\r\npromised to be as extremely handsome as her sister seemed likely to be\r\nhomely. Indeed, Amelia was a beautiful counterpart of Cornelia, resembling\r\nher in the same wise that a flattered portrait, painted by some shrewd and\r\nskilful limner, will sometimes resemble the rich and ugly original, in\r\nwhich, while the likeness is faithfully portrayed, all the harsh lines are\r\nsoftened, and even blemishes are transformed into beauty-spots, or made to\r\nserve as foils.\r\n\r\nBesides these twins, other children, from time to time, were born to the\r\nDoctor and his spouse, all of whom died in infancy. The love of the parents\r\nfor their first-born seemed to redouble at each of these bereavements. The\r\nmother, especially, would scarcely suffer her darlings to be absent from\r\nher sight; and when, at last, after infinite persuasion, she was induced to\r\nlet them go to the Misses Primber's great boarding-school at Hartford, she\r\nused to ride over to see them as often as she could invent a pretext. It\r\nwas with the greatest reluctance that she consented to this separation; but\r\nin those days it was indispensable that a young woman of good family should\r\nspend at least a twelve-month at the Misses Primber's famous establishment,\r\nwhere all the rough hewing of less skilful teachers was shaped and\r\npolished, so to speak, according to the most fashionable models then in\r\nvogue. It was while the twins remained at this notable seminary that they\r\nexecuted those wonderful landscapes, in Reeves's best water-colors, which\r\nused to decorate the walls of the parlors in the Bugbee mansion, and which,\r\nI dare say, still hang in tarnished gilt frames in some of the bedchambers.\r\nIt was there they filled the copybooks of French exercises from Levizac's\r\nGrammar, which Miss Cornelia still carefully preserves in a bureau drawer.\r\nThere they learned to play and sing \"Days of Absence,\" \"I'm A Merry Swiss\r\nBoy,\" and many other delightful melodies, the which, even now, Miss\r\nCornelia will sometimes hum softly to herself. Besides acquiring these and\r\nsundry other accomplishments, Miss Amelia found time to carry on a secret\r\nepistolary correspondence with a good-looking young law-student, (of whom\r\nmore extended mention will presently be made,) and also to contrive many\r\nmeetings and walks with him, of which nobody was cognizant but her sister\r\nand some five or six other bosom friends and faithful confidants. But\r\nMiss Cornelia, though as well inclined thereto as her sister, having,\r\nnevertheless, been able to find no lover to occupy her thoughts, and with\r\nwhom to hold amatory interviews to fill her leisure, was fain to devote all\r\nher spare moments to the reading of romances and novels, of which, though\r\nrigorously interdicted, a great number were in the house, in possession of\r\nthe Misses Primber's pupils; and when this supply was exhausted, she had\r\nrecourse to a circulating library near by; being often put as nearly to her\r\nwits' end to devise expedients whereby to smuggle the contraband volumes\r\ninto her chamber, as Amelia was to fulfil, at the time and place of tryst,\r\nthe frequent engagements which she made to meet her lover.\r\n\r\nAccordingly it came to pass, that Amelia's heart became affected in such a\r\nway and to that degree that she was never heart-whole again so long as she\r\nlived; and Cornelia's head was filled with such an accumulation of romantic\r\nrubbish, that, to this very day, a mighty heap of it remains,--mingled, to\r\nbe sure, with ideas of a more solid and useful quality. For when a woman\r\nlives a maid during those years in which most of her sex are busy with\r\nthe cares attendant upon the matronly estate, fantastic notions, such as\r\nI have mentioned, are not so apt to be excluded from the mind, and in\r\nthis way many girls of good natural parts are spoiled, merely for lack of\r\nhusbands. With the exception of this inordinate liking for the romantic\r\nand mysterious,--by which she was sometimes betrayed into follies and\r\nabsurdities that provoked a little harmless scandal or ridicule,--Miss\r\nCornelia has ever been held in good repute among her neighbors as a\r\nkind-hearted, obliging, sentimental little woman.\r\n\r\nAt last, at the end of a year, the young ladies came home from the\r\nseminary, having fully completed their education; an event which filled\r\nMrs. Bugbee's heart with ineffable satisfaction. When the loving mother\r\nreflected, that, for a long time, if it pleased God to spare their lives,\r\nshe should now enjoy the pleasure of her children's presence, her bosom\r\noverflowed with happiness. Though she looked forward to their being married\r\nas to something quite likely to happen in the course of time, yet such\r\nevents are always uncertain, and they appeared to her to lie so far ahead\r\nin the vague distance of the future, that these anticipations caused her\r\nno serious disquiet. For the girls were but eighteen years of age, and it\r\nseemed hardly a twelvemonth since the time when they used to wear their\r\nhair curling in their necks, and to go hand in hand to the district school\r\nin pinafores and pantalets.\r\n\r\nThe good lady's chagrin, therefore, was excessive, when, the next Saturday\r\nmorning but one after her daughters' return, Amelia came into her bedroom,\r\nwhere she sat darning a stocking by the window, and after so much\r\nhesitation that her mother began to wonder, suddenly put her arms about her\r\nneck, hid her blushing face upon her shoulder, and in that position softly\r\nwhispered a confession, that a certain young gentleman, with whom she had\r\nbecome acquainted in Hartford, had told her he was very much attached to\r\nher indeed; that she was not wholly indifferent with respect to him, and\r\nthat, in fact, she loved him. While Mrs. Bugbee remained speechless with\r\nsurprise, Miss Amelia proceeded to say, that it was highly probable the\r\nyoung gentleman would that very afternoon take it into his head to ride\r\nout from Hartford to Belfield; and perhaps he would also request permission\r\nto visit her regularly, with the ultimate purpose of asking her hand in\r\nmarriage; in which case, she said, it was to be hoped her parents would not\r\nrefuse his modest petition; for that the young gentleman was a very good\r\nand worthy young gentleman, a law-student of extraordinary promise, of as\r\nold and respectable a family as any other in the State, and, withal, a\r\nyoung gentleman in no wise given to bad habits of any kind whatsoever, but,\r\non the contrary, distinguished for his exemplary morals and sober conduct.\r\nAll this Amelia uttered very earnestly; but, strange to say, made no\r\nmention of the quality which, as much as all the rest, had attracted\r\nher regards; namely, the young gentleman's good looks, for which he was\r\nsomewhat noted, and of which he was not a little vain.\r\n\r\nWhen the Doctor returned that day from his morning ride among his patients,\r\nhis wife took him aside into their bedroom and related what has just been\r\nset forth. The Doctor listened with grave attention till his wife concluded\r\nher story; but when, at the end of it, she began to lament, he turned the\r\nthing off with a laugh, and giving her a hearty kiss, endeavored to soothe\r\nher disquiet. \"Well, well, mother,\" said he, \"why, let him come, let him\r\ncome. It's only a year or two sooner than I expected, and may be it'll be a\r\nflash in the pan after all. I think I must have seen the young fellow in at\r\nSquire Johnson's; and at any rate, I'm pretty sure I know his father. When\r\nhe comes, we'll just invite him right over here to spend the Sabbath, and\r\nby the time he goes away on Monday we'll know the twist of every thread in\r\nhis jacket. If he's the right one to make our girl happy, we ought to be\r\nglad she's found him; and if he a'n't, it'll be all the harder to make her\r\nlisten to reason, unless we show reason ourselves; and, surely, it would be\r\nunreasonable to be set against him, before we've even seen him or heard him\r\nsay a word.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Edward Talcott (for that was the young gentleman's name) came over\r\nfrom the tavern, where he had left his horse and portmanteau, and with much\r\nsecret trepidation and assumed boldness had walked up the wide flagstones\r\nwhich led from the street to the green front door of Doctor Bugbee's\r\nmansion, it was opened, at the summons of the brass knocker, by a little\r\nblack girl, who vainly strove to hide a grin behind a corner of her long\r\ncheck apron. Before the visitor had time to utter a word, Amelia, blushing\r\nlike a rose and looking handsomer than ever, came tripping into the hall,\r\nand after a whisper, which Dinah, who tried, failed to overhear, and the\r\npurport of which, therefore, I cannot relate, ushered him into the parlor,\r\nand presented him in due form to her mother, and also to her grandmother,\r\nMadam Major Bugbee, as she was styled by the townsfolk,--a stately old\r\nlady in black silk, who, being hard of hearing, and therefore incapable of\r\nmingling in the conversation that ensued, regarded the new comer through\r\nher gold-bowed spectacles, during the remainder of the afternoon, with a\r\nfurtive, but earnest attention which was quite embarrassing to the object\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nPresently a sulky came dashing up the drive, and soon afterwards the Doctor\r\ncame in, who, being made acquainted with Mr. Talcott by the blushing\r\nAmelia, fell into a lively conversation with his visitor, which finally\r\nturning upon the subject of politics, both gentlemen agreed cordially\r\nin lauding the wisdom displayed in Mr. Adams's administration, and\r\ncongratulating each other and the country upon the defeat of General\r\nJackson. After tea, the hired man was sent to fetch Mr. Talcott's horse and\r\nluggage from the inn, and then, it being near sundown, the Doctor put on as\r\nsolemn an expression as his merry visage was capable of assuming, took up\r\nthe big quarto Bible from its place, on a stand in the corner of the room,\r\nand read a chapter from the New Testament. Then, standing up behind his\r\narm-chair, he made a hurried prayer, which was evidently one he had got by\r\nheart; for when he endeavored to interpolate an apt allusion to the young\r\n\"stranger within his gates,\" he made such a piece of work of it, that\r\neverybody but the dowager had to bite his lips to keep from smiling. The\r\nbrief remainder of the evening was spent in sober conversation. Soon after\r\nnine o'clock the little black girl showed Mr. Talcott up the broad stairway\r\ninto the best front chamber, a spacious apartment directly over the parlor,\r\nwhere he went to bed under a lofty tester canopy, with embroidered curtains\r\ntrimmed with lace. After a long reverie, coming to the conclusion that\r\nthe downright courtship of a young lady in her father's house was a much\r\nmore serious affair than a mere clandestine flirtation with a pretty\r\nschool-girl, the young gentleman turned over upon his side and went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe next day, being Sunday, everybody went to meeting, except the Doctor,\r\nwho was obliged to ride away upon his round of visits. Accordingly, Mr.\r\nTalcott walked twice to and fro across the green, with Miss Amelia tripping\r\ndemurely by his side, and served as the target for a thousand eyeshots as\r\nhe stood up at the head of the Doctor's pew during the long prayers.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, after supper, the Doctor put off his grave Sabbath face\r\nand invited his young guest to walk over to the store, which stood in the\r\ncorner of the yard, a little distance off. Presently, Miss Amelia, peeping\r\nfrom behind her bedroom window-curtain, beheld them sitting together upon\r\nthe broad back-stoop of the store, talking and smoking in a most amicable\r\nmanner, the fragrant incense of their cigars being wafted across the\r\nintervening space, which was quite too wide, however, to enable her to hear\r\nthe words of their earnest conversation. But that night, as she and her\r\nlover sat together alone in the front parlor, after the family had gone to\r\nbed, he told her that her father had consented to his courtship.\r\n\r\nBut if I am so circumstantial in relating these events, which are merely\r\nintroductory to my story, I shall have neither time nor space left for\r\nthe story itself. So I will hasten to say, that the upshot of Mr. Edward\r\nTalcott's frequent visits, as might have been expected, was a very splendid\r\nwedding, which took place in the front parlor of the Bugbee mansion, one\r\nevening during the winter after Amelia came nineteen, the bridegroom being\r\nthen twenty-three, and just admitted to practice as an attorney-at-law. In\r\npursuance of a condition which Mrs. Bugbee had proposed, in order to avoid\r\nthe pangs of a separation from her child, the young couple remained members\r\nof the Doctor's household; and Mr. Talcott, who, through the influence of\r\nhis wife's father, had been taken into partnership with a well-established\r\nattorney, commenced the practice of law at the Hillsdale bar. His partner,\r\nSquire Bramhall, had for many years been clerk of the courts, and was a\r\nsage and prudent counsellor, noted for the careful preparation bestowed\r\nupon his causes before they came to trial. But, in spite of his learning\r\nand industrious painstaking, he used to cut a poor figure at the bar; for\r\nbeing, though a lawyer, an exceedingly modest and bashful man, he failed to\r\nacquire the habit of addressing either court or jury with ease, fluency, or\r\nforce. On the other hand, Squire Talcott, as he soon came to be called, was\r\na young man of fine appearance and good address, in no wise troubled with\r\nan undue degree of doubt touching the excellence of his own abilities. His\r\nfirst argument before a jury was a showy and successful effort in behalf\r\nof a person for whom the sympathies of the public were already warmly\r\nenlisted. By this, of course, he won considerable applause. His subsequent\r\nattempts sustained the popular expectation. He began to acquire distinction\r\nas a fluent, persuasive, and even eloquent speaker. A lawyer haranguing a\r\njury in a densely crowded courtroom fills a much larger space in the public\r\neye than when, in the solitude of his back-office, he is preparing a brief;\r\nand, as young Squire Talcott used to argue all the cases which his plodding\r\npartner elaborately prepared to his hand, his fame as a wonderfully smart\r\nyoung lawyer soon began to extend even beyond the limits of the county.\r\nThe judges, in other places upon their circuit, spoke of his quick and\r\nbrilliant parts, and his apparent learning and familiar acquaintance\r\nwith authorities, so unusual at his age. These flattering commendations,\r\nreturning to Belfield, came to young Talcott's ears. It would have been\r\nstrange if he had not been too much elated by his sudden success in\r\nthe practice of a profession in which so very few win a speedy renown.\r\nForgetful how much of the praise he received was due to his partner's\r\nlaborious researches and unobtrusive learning, he suffered his vanity to\r\nlead him astray; becoming discontented with his position, and secretly\r\nrepining at the necessity by which he was compelled to remain in an obscure\r\ncountry town, when, as he imagined, his talents were sufficient to win for\r\nhim, unaided, an easy and rapid promotion even at the metropolitan bar.\r\n\r\nThe Doctor and his wife, as was to be expected, soon got to be proud of\r\ntheir clever son-in-law. In fact, after the birth of a little girl, an\r\nevent by which the honors of grand-paternity were conferred upon the Doctor\r\nwhen he was but a year or two past forty, Mrs. Bugbee could scarcely tell\r\nwhich she loved best, her daughter, the baby, or its father.\r\n\r\nWhen little Helen, as the child was named, was just coming three years old,\r\nMrs. Talcott, being in childbed again, was taken with a fever, and, in\r\nspite of everything which was done to save her, died, and was buried with\r\nher infant on her bosom. I do not need to relate what a grievous stroke\r\nthis sad event was to all the household,--nay, I might say to the whole\r\nvillage as well; for all who knew Amelia loved her, and the praise of the\r\ndead was in everybody's mouth. As for poor Mrs. Bugbee, she sorrowed like\r\none in despair. Even the worthy parson's pious words, to which she appeared\r\nto listen with passive attention, fell unheeded upon her ear. People began\r\nto shake their heads when her name was mentioned, and to predict that ere\r\nlong she would follow her daughter to the grave. At last, however, after\r\nmany weeks of close seclusion, she grew more cheerful, and seemed to\r\ntransfer all the affection she had borne the dead to the child who survived\r\nher.\r\n\r\nNot long after Amelia's death, the secret discontent existing in her\r\nhusband's mind, which, if she had lived, would in time, perhaps, have\r\nabated, began instead to increase, and at length he came to talk openly\r\nof departure. The Doctor, perceiving that he was firmly resolved upon the\r\nstep, did not seriously endeavor to dissuade him; and even Mrs. Bugbee\r\ncould not withhold her consent, when the young widower said, with a\r\ntrembling voice, he could not endure to stay in a spot endeared to him by\r\nno other associations than those which continually reminded him of his\r\ngrievous loss. One stipulation only the good couple insisted on; namely,\r\nthat Amelia's child should be given to them, to be adopted as their own\r\ndaughter. Knowing not whither he should go, the father yielded; reflecting\r\nthat he could not better promote the welfare of his little girl than by\r\nconsenting.\r\n\r\nSo, a few weeks afterwards, when Edward Talcott bade farewell to Belfield,\r\nthe relation of parent and child between him and his little daughter was\r\ncompletely severed. For though since their first sorrowful parting they\r\nhave met more than once, and though long after that mournful day she used\r\nto wear in her bosom a locket containing his miniature and a lock of his\r\nhair, which she used to kiss every night and morning, yet Helen seldom\r\nremembers that the distant stranger is her father, and he forgets to reckon\r\nhis first-born among the number of his children.\r\n\r\nWhen he was gone, the child was told that the name of Bugbee was thereafter\r\nto be appended to those she already bore; and being quite pleased with the\r\nnotion, she forthwith adopted her new appellative, retaining it for several\r\nyears, until (such is the fickle nature of women) she took a fancy to\r\nchange it for another which she liked better still. She was also taught\r\nto call her grandparents papa and mamma; and though, while a child, she\r\ncontinued to address Miss Cornelia by the title of \"Aunty,\" this respectful\r\ncustom, as the relative difference between her age and the elder spinster's\r\ngradually diminished, was suffered, at the latter's special request, to\r\nfall into disuse, and give place to the designation of sister. The few\r\nnew-comers to Belfield, therefore, were never apt to suspect that Helen\r\nBugbee was not really the Doctor's own daughter; and even the neighbors\r\nforgot that her name had ever been changed, except when the gossips\r\nsometimes put each other in mind of it.\r\n\r\nThe older she grew the more Helen resembled her mother, as the ladies\r\nalways used to exclaim when they came to take tea with Mrs. Bugbee. Some\r\nof the village folks, who were in the habit, so common with old people, of\r\nthinking that the race is continually degenerating, I have heard express\r\nthe opinion that Helen was never so handsome as her mother had been. But I\r\nhave seen a portrait of Miss Amelia Bugbee, for which she sat just before\r\nher wedding, and which, I am assured, was, in the time of it, called a\r\nwonderful likeness; I also knew Miss Helen Talcott Bugbee when she was not\r\nfar from her mother's age at the time the picture was taken; and though\r\nMiss Amelia must have been a very sweet young lady, of extraordinarily good\r\nlooks, I used to think, for my part, that Helen was much handsomer than the\r\nportrait; although people of a different taste might very properly have\r\npreferred the less haughty expression of the face depicted on the canvas.\r\n\r\nIt was not strange that Helen was petted and humored as much as was well\r\nfor her. But her disposition being naturally docile and amiable, she was\r\nnot to be easily spoiled. Be that as it may, however, when she had grown to\r\nbe a woman, there were, I dare say, no less than fifty young men who knew\r\nher well, any one of whom would have jumped at the chance to get her for a\r\nwife, and made but little account of the risk of her turning out a shrew.\r\nTo be sure, when I first knew her, she had rather a high and mighty\r\nway with her, at which some people took offence, calling her proud and\r\ndisdainful; but those whom she wished to please never failed to like her;\r\nand I used to observe she seldom put on any of her lofty airs when she\r\nspoke to unpresuming people, especially if they were poor or in humble\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nThough the indulgence of all her whims and fancies by her doting\r\ngrandparents was a danger of no small magnitude, Helen encountered a still\r\ngreater peril in the shape of a vast store of novels, poems, and romances,\r\nwhich Miss Cornelia had accumulated, and to which she was continually\r\nmaking additions. In that young lady's bedchamber, where Helen slept,\r\nthere was a large bookcase full of these seductive volumes; even the upper\r\nshelves of the wardrobe closet, and a cupboard over the mantel, were\r\nclosely packed with them; and there was not one of them all which Helen\r\nhad not read by the time she was fifteen. Thus, in spite of natural good\r\nsense, strengthened and educated by much wise and wholesome instruction,\r\nshe grew up with an imagination quite disproportioned to her other mental\r\nfaculties; so that, in some respects, she was almost as romantic in her\r\nnotions as her Aunt Cornelia, who, at forty, used to prefer moonlight to\r\ngood honest sunshine, and would have heard with an emotion of delight\r\nthat the mountains between Belfield and Hartford were infested by a band\r\nof brigands, in picturesque attire, with a handsome chief like Rinaldo\r\nRinaldini, or haunted by two or three dashing highwaymen, of the genteel\r\nPaul-Clifford style. Indeed, the ideal lover, to whom for many years Miss\r\nCornelia's heart was constant as the moon, was a tall, dark, mysterious\r\nman, with a heavy beard and glittering eyes, who, there is every reason to\r\nsuspect, was either a corsair, a smuggler, or a bandit chief.\r\n\r\nI am loath to have it supposed that Helen turned out a silly young woman.\r\nIndeed, it would be wrong to believe so; for she possessed many good parts\r\nand acquirements. But I must confess that her fancy, being naturally\r\nlively, was unduly stimulated by reading too many books of the kind I have\r\nmentioned; and that seeing but little of the world in her tender years, she\r\nlearned from their pages to form false and extravagant notions concerning\r\nit. She used to build castles in the air, was subject to fits of tender\r\nmelancholy, and, like Miss Cornelia, adored moonlight, pensive music, and\r\nsentimental poetry. But she would have shrunk from contact with a brigand,\r\nin a sugar-loaf hat, with a carbine slung across his shoulder, and a\r\nstiletto in his sash, with precisely the same kind and degree of horror and\r\ndisgust that would have affected her in the presence of a vulgar footpad,\r\nin a greasy Scotch-cap, armed with a horse-pistol and a sheath-knife. Her\r\nromantic tastes differed in many respects from her Aunt Cornelia's. She,\r\ntoo, had an ideal lover; (and for that matter the fickle little maid had\r\nseveral;) but the special favorite was a charming young fellow, of fair\r\ncomplexion, with blue eyes, and a light, elegant moustache, his long brown\r\nhair falling down his neck in wavy masses,--tall in stature, athletic, and\r\nyet slim and graceful,--gifted with many accomplishments, with a heart full\r\nof noble qualities, and a brain inspired by genius,--a poet, or an author,\r\nor an artist, perhaps a lawyer merely, but of rare talents, at any rate\r\na man of superior intellect,--in a word, a paragon, who, when he should\r\nappear upon the earth, incarnate, she expected would conceive a violent\r\npassion for her, in which case, she should take it into consideration\r\nwhether to marry him or not.\r\n\r\nMy inexperience in the art of story-telling must be manifest to everybody;\r\nfor here I am talking of Helen, as of a young lady of sixteen or more, with\r\nshy notions of beaux and lovers in her head,--whereas, in point of time,\r\nmy story has not advanced by regular stages beyond the period of her\r\nchildhood, when she thought more of a single doll in her baby-house, and\r\nheld her in higher estimation, than the whole rising generation of the\r\nother sex. I shall resume the thread of my narrative by relating, that,\r\nsome two or three years before Miss Cornelia Bugbee, in her journey across\r\nthe sands of time, came to the thirtieth mile-stone, she arrived at an\r\noasis in the desert of her existence; or, to be more explicit, she had the\r\nrare good-fortune to find a heart throbbing in unison with her own,--a\r\ntender bosom in whose fidelity she could safely confide even her most\r\nprecious secret; namely, the passion she entertained for the aforementioned\r\ncorsair,--a being of congenial soul, whose loving ears could hear and\r\ninterpret her lowest whisper and most incoherent murmur, by means of the\r\nsubtile instinct of spiritual sympathy,--in fine, a trusty, true, and\r\nconfidential friend.\r\n\r\nAll this, and more, was Miss Laura Stebbins, the youngest sister of Mrs.\r\nJaynes, who, being suddenly left an orphan, dependent on the charity of her\r\nkindred, came to reside at the parsonage in Belfield. An intimacy forthwith\r\ncommenced between the Doctor's daughter and the Parson's sister-in-law,\r\nwhich ripened speedily into the enduring friendship of which mention has\r\njust been made. There were some who affected to wonder at the ardent\r\nattachment which sprung up between the two young ladies, because, forsooth,\r\none was but sixteen, and the other eight-and-twenty; as if this slight\r\ndisparity in years must necessarily engender a diversity of tastes, fatal\r\nto a budding friendship.\r\n\r\nI would fain describe the person of Miss Laura Stebbins, if I could call\r\nto mind any similitudes, whereunto to liken her charms, which have not\r\nbeen worn out in the service of other people's heroines. To use any but\r\nbrand-new comparisons to illustrate graces like hers would be singularly\r\ninappropriate; for she herself always had a bright, fresh look, like some\r\npiece of handiwork just finished by the maker. Her hair was black, glossy,\r\nand abundant. She had large, hazel eyes, full of expression, shaded by\r\nlong, black eyelashes, a clear, light-brown complexion, rosy cheeks, small,\r\neven teeth, as white as cocoanut meat, and lips whose color was like the\r\ntint of sealing-wax. There was not a straight line or an angle about her\r\nplump and well-proportioned figure. Her waist was round and full, and yet\r\nappeared so slim between the ravishing curves of her shapely form, above\r\nand below it, that it seemed as if it were fashioned so on purpose to be\r\nembraced.\r\n\r\nIf Laura had been as wise as she was handsome, some pen more worthy than\r\nmine would have celebrated her wit and beauty. But she was nothing more\r\nthan a wild, merry, frolicsome girl, whom, if you knew her, it was very\r\nhard not to like; even her reverend brother-in-law, a very grave personage,\r\nof whom, at first, she stood in no little awe, learned to smile at some of\r\nher very giddiest nonsense, and Mrs. Bugbee's sober reserve, which had been\r\nincreased by her domestic afflictions, thawed in the sunshine of Laura's\r\npresence, like snow in the warmth of a bright spring morning. Helen, also,\r\ngrew to be extremely fond of Laura, who returned the child's regard in\r\ntwofold measure, at least, and yet had love enough to spare wherewith\r\nto answer the immense draughts upon her heart by which Miss Cornelia's\r\nromantic affection was repaid.\r\n\r\nIt was more than even Miss Cornelia Bugbee could do to transform this gay\r\ncreature into a lackadaisical young lady; though, as she tried her very\r\nbest to do so, none ought to blame her because she failed of success. All\r\nher stock of novels she lent to Laura, who read them, every one, in secret,\r\nskipping only the dull and didactic pages. That she was not spoiled by\r\nthis experiment was due less to the strength of Laura's understanding than\r\nto the liveliness of her temper, which, in this strait, stood her in very\r\ngood stead of more solid qualities and a wiser experience. As it was,\r\nshe learned to talk in a romantic fashion, longed, above all things, to\r\ngrow thin, pretended to sigh frequently, and affected, at times, an air\r\nof pensive thoughtfulness. Her imagination began to be haunted by the\r\napparition of a brave, gallant, and exceedingly graceful and good-looking\r\nyoung officer, of rank and high renown, who, she confidently hoped, would\r\nsome day appear before her, arrayed in full uniform, with a sword by his\r\nside, and, with all the impetuous ardor of a soldier, throw himself at her\r\nfeet and pour forth a declaration of inextinguishable love.\r\n\r\nUntil Laura was nearly twenty, this phantom in regimentals held exclusive\r\npossession of her bosom, and reigned in that sweet domain without a rival;\r\nfor, strange as it may appear, she never had a suitor of real flesh and\r\nblood, until a certain young divinity-student from East Windsor Seminary,\r\nwho sometimes of a Sunday when Mr. Jaynes was absent came over to Belfield\r\nto try his hand at preaching, perceived, by sly and stealthy glances at\r\nLaura over the rim of his blue spectacles, how exceeding comely the damsel\r\nwas, and firmly resolved to win her for a helpmeet. And even Mr. Elam Hunt\r\n(for that was the pious student's name) seemed scarcely more substantial\r\nthan a ghost, so very pale and bloodless was his meagre face, and so lean\r\nand spare his stooping, narrow-chested figure.\r\n\r\nThis youthful saint was well esteemed by Laura's sister, Mrs. Jaynes, a\r\nsharp-visaged little woman, to whose energetic control her absent-minded,\r\nstudious husband surrendered the parsonage and all it contained. Nay,\r\nshe even shared his labors in the moral vineyard of his parish; for\r\nwhile he remained at home among his favorite volumes, she used to go\r\nabout from house to house, collecting donations in aid of some one of\r\nthe great eleemosynary corporations, whose certificates attesting her\r\nlife-membership, all framed and glazed, covered the walls of the parsonage\r\nparlor. Her zeal in this good work was untiring, and she levied tribute to\r\nher favorite charities upon all classes and conditions of her neighbors\r\nwith strict impartiality. The poorest widow was not suffered to withhold\r\nher mite, and, wherever she went, the pouting children of the household\r\nwere forced to open their money-boxes and tin savings-banks, and bring\r\nforth the hoarded pence with which they had hoped to purchase candy and\r\ntoys at Christmas and New Year. The village folks reckoned the cost of her\r\nvisits among their annual expenses, and, when she was seen approaching,\r\nmade ready, as if a sturdy beggar or a tax-gatherer was at the door.\r\n\r\nTo have heard this estimable lady, when in private she sometimes rebuked\r\nthe failings of her reverend spouse, one would not have supposed that she\r\nregarded him with awful veneration; nevertheless, she magnified his\r\noffice greatly. The dignity conferred by ordination she held to be the\r\nhighest honor to which a mortal man can possibly attain. Herself adorning\r\nthe elevated station of a pastor's wife, she resolved to secure for Laura a\r\nposition of equal eminence. When, therefore, she perceived that her sister\r\nhad found favor in the eyes of Mr. Elam Hunt, she gave the bashful student\r\nfrequent opportunities to speak his mind; and when, at last, he ventured\r\nin private to tell her of the flame which warmed his breast with a\r\ngentle glow, quite unlike that fervent heat by which the hearts of more\r\nimpassioned, worldly-minded swains are apt to be tortured and consumed, she\r\nassuaged his pangs of doubt by encouraging assurances of her countenance\r\nand favor. In the mean time she resolved to guard against every\r\nmisadventure by which the successful termination of his suit might be\r\nprevented or imperilled.\r\n\r\nThis was by no means an easy thing to do; for Laura, at twenty, though an\r\norphan, without a penny to buy even so much as a dozen teaspoons for a\r\nsetting-out, was not a girl that would have been apt to lack for lovers, if\r\nshe had had a fair chance to get them. As I have already told you, she was\r\nas sweet and as pretty as a pink full of dewdrops, and might have picked\r\nout a sweetheart from as many beaux as she had fingers and thumbs, but that\r\nher vigilant duenna, Mrs. Jaynes, kept the young fellows beyond courting\r\ndistance. It was impossible, even for this shrewd and discreet lady, so\r\nto manage, without danger of giving offence, as to prevent Laura from\r\nassociating with the other young folks of the parish; and indeed, to do\r\nher justice, she was not so austerely strict that she desired her sister\r\nto abstain from all social intercourse with those of her own age, sex, and\r\ncondition. On the contrary, as the reader already knows, she was permitted\r\nto cherish a tender and devoted friendship for Miss Cornelia Bugbee; and\r\nthere were several other young ladies, whose brothers were only little\r\nboys, with whom she was on the most amicable and familiar terms.\r\n\r\nBut by means of various arts and devices Mrs. Jaynes contrived to keep the\r\nyoung men from becoming too intimate with her pretty sister; although some\r\nof them had vainly endeavored to be more than neighborly. If one ventured\r\nto call at the parsonage, Mrs. Jaynes was always in the parlor, with Laura,\r\nto receive him, and sat there, grimly, on the sofa, as long as he staid;\r\ntaking a part in the conversation, which she generally managed to turn upon\r\nthe most grave and serious topics. The benighted condition of the heathen\r\nwas a favorite subject of discourse with her, upon these occasions; and the\r\nvisitor was a lucky youth, if he escaped without making, upon the spot,\r\na cash contribution to the worthy cause of foreign missions. If Laura\r\nwas invited to ride or to walk with a gentleman, Mrs. Jaynes always had a\r\nplausible pretext for objecting. It was either too hot, or too cold, or\r\ntoo damp, or too dusty, or there was sure to be some other reason, equally\r\nsufficient, for withholding her consent. As for balls and cotillon parties,\r\nthe most enterprising and audacious youngster of them all would have\r\nquailed at the idea of facing the parson's wife with a request to take her\r\nsister to such a place. At last the report got wind that Mrs. Jaynes was\r\nsaving Laura for Mr. Elam Hunt, until such time as, having finished his\r\ncourse of study at East Windsor, he should be ordained and settled in a\r\nparish of his own, and ready to take to himself a wife. To be sure, it did\r\nnot seem that Laura was of the right sort of temper for a minister's sober\r\nhelpmeet; nevertheless, this rumor gained credit, and very soon came to\r\nbe believed by many of the neighbors. Mrs. Jaynes, it was noticed, would\r\nnever contradict the story, though, to be sure, Laura herself always did,\r\nwhenever she had a chance to do so. Indeed, she was often heard to declare,\r\nwith great vehemence and apparent sincerity, that she would as lief be\r\nburied alive as marry that living skeleton,--by which scandalous epithet\r\nshe designated the lean and reverend youth from East Windsor. Some people\r\nwho heard these protestations let them go for naught, giving them all the\r\nless heed on account of their violence, or, perhaps, being even confirmed\r\nin the belief of what she so earnestly denied. For it is a very common\r\nartifice with young women to pretend a strong aversion for their most\r\nfavored lovers, and to feign an utter dislike and abhorrence for the very\r\npersons whom they love most fondly. Others, however, gave credit to her\r\npassionate declarations, and believed that she recoiled from the idea of\r\nmarrying the lank young student with unfeigned repugnance and disgust.\r\nBetween people holding these diverse opinions discussions would sometimes\r\narise, especially at meetings of the Dorcas Society, when neither Laura\r\nnor Mrs. Jaynes was present. But, just at this juncture, an event occurred\r\nwhich gave a new direction to the current of village gossip, setting every\r\nmember of the Dorcas sisterhood all agape with wonder and surprise, and all\r\nagog with excitement and curiosity. Of this strange and memorable affair I\r\nwill presently give a veritable account, and even show the reader how it\r\ncame to pass. But in the mean time the fortunes of the Bugbee family demand\r\nmy brief attention.\r\n\r\n[Continued in the next Number.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF DIDACTIC POETRY\r\n\r\n\r\n  When wise Minerva still was young\r\n    And just the least romantic,\r\n  Soon after from Jove's head she flung\r\n    That preternatural antic,\r\n  'Tis said to keep from idleness\r\n    Or flirting,--those twin curses,--\r\n  She spent her leisure, more or less,\r\n    In writing po--, no, verses.\r\n\r\n  How nice they were! to rhyme with _far_\r\n    A kind _star_ did not tarry;\r\n  The metre, too, was regular\r\n    As schoolboy's dot and carry;\r\n  And full they were of pious plums,\r\n    So extra-super-moral,--\r\n  For sucking Virtue's tender gums\r\n    Most tooth-enticing coral.\r\n\r\n  A clean, fair copy she prepares,\r\n    Makes sure of moods and tenses,\r\n  With her own hand,--for prudence spares\r\n    A man-(or woman)-uensis;\r\n  Complete, and tied with ribbons proud,\r\n    She hinted soon how cosy a\r\n  Treat it would be to read them loud\r\n    After next day's Ambrosia.\r\n\r\n  The Gods thought not it would amuse\r\n    So much as Homer's Odyssees,\r\n  But could not very well refuse\r\n    The properest of Goddesses;\r\n  So all sat round in attitudes\r\n    Of various dejection,\r\n  As with a _hem!_ the queen of prudes\r\n    Began her grave prelection.\r\n\r\n  At the first pause Zeus said, \"Well sung!--\r\n    I mean--ask Phoebus,--_he_ knows.\"\r\n  Says Phoebus, \"Zounds! a wolf's among\r\n    Admetus's merinos!\r\n  Fine! very fine! but I must go;\r\n    They stand in need of me there;\r\n  Excuse me!\" snatched his stick, and so\r\n    Plunged down the gladdened ether.\r\n\r\n  With the next gap, Mars said, \"For me\r\n    Don't wait,--naught could be finer;\r\n  But I'm engaged at half-past three,--\r\n    A fight in Asia Minor!\"\r\n  Then Venus lisped, \"How very thad!\r\n    It rainth down there in torrinth;\r\n  But I _mutht_ go, becauthe they've had\r\n    A thacrifithe in Corinth!\"\r\n\r\n  Then Bacchus,--\"With those slamming doors\r\n    I lost the last half dist--(hic!)\r\n  Mos' bu'ful se'ments! what's the Chor's?\r\n    My voice shall not be missed--(hic!)\"\r\n  His words woke Hermes; \"Ah!\" he said,\r\n    \"I so love moral theses!\"\r\n  Then winked at Hebe, who turned red,\r\n    And smoothed her apron's creases.\r\n\r\n  Just then Zeus snored,--the Eagle drew\r\n    His head the wing from under;\r\n  Zeus snored,--o'er startled Greece there flew\r\n    The many-volumed thunder;\r\n  Some augurs counted nine,--some, ten,--\r\n    Some said, 'twas war,--some, famine,--\r\n  And all, that other-minded men\r\n    Would get a precious ----.\r\n\r\n  Proud Pallas sighed, \"It will not do;\r\n    Against the Muse I've sinned, oh!\"\r\n  And her torn rhymes sent flying through\r\n    Olympus's back window.\r\n  Then, packing up a peplus clean,\r\n    She took the shortest path thence,\r\n  And opened, with a mind serene,\r\n    A Sunday-school in Athens.\r\n\r\n  The verses? Some, in ocean swilled,\r\n    Killed every fish that bit to 'em;\r\n  Some Galen caught, and, when distilled,\r\n    Found morphine the residuum;\r\n  But some that rotted on the earth\r\n    Sprang up again in copies,\r\n  And gave two strong narcotics birth,--\r\n    Didactic bards and poppies.\r\n\r\n  Years after, when a poet asked\r\n    The Goddess's opinion,\r\n  As being one whose soul had basked\r\n    In Art's clear-aired dominion,--\r\n  \"Discriminate,\" she said, \"betimes;\r\n    The Muse is unforgiving;\r\n  Put all your beauty in your rhymes,\r\n    Your morals in your living.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FINANCIAL FLURRY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Break, break, break,\r\n  On thy cold, gray crags, O Sea!\"\r\n\r\n\"I remember a day,\" said a friend not long since, \"a day as sweet, calm,\r\ncool, and bright as that whose wedding and funeral song the poet sings in\r\nthe same verse, when I stood upon the white sea-coast near Naples, and\r\nlooked far away across the blue, silent waters, and up the gray, flowery\r\nsteeps, to where the towering cone of Vesuvius cleaves the skies. It was in\r\nthe spring-time; luxuriant nature seemed to have nothing to do but to grow\r\nand bloom, and the huge mountain itself was profoundly at peace,--smiling\r\na welcome, apparently, to the delicate bean-plants and wild vines which\r\nclambered up its sides, and wearing a light curl of smoke, like a gay\r\ncoronal, around its brow. The bay was alive with red-capped fishermen,\r\neach one intent on fishing up his inverted brother below him; the beach\r\nwas thronged with women, who chattered cheerfully over their baskets; and\r\nalong the road scampered soldiers in bright uniforms, as if they had no\r\nconceivable purpose in life but to bathe in that clear sunshine, and\r\nbreathe that soft, delicious air.\r\n\r\n\"A few hours later,\" continued he, \"I stood not far from the same spot,\r\nand saw that mountain angrily belching forth pitch and flames; the earth\r\nbeneath my feet groaned with sullen, suppressed rage, or as if it were\r\nin pain; vast volumes of lurid smoke rolled through the sky, and streams\r\nof melted brimstone coursed down the hill-sides, burning up the pretty\r\nflowers, crushing the trees, and ruthlessly devouring the snug farms and\r\ncottages of the loving Philemons and Baucises who had incautiously built\r\ntoo near the fatal precinct. The poor _contadini_, who lately chaffered so\r\nvivaciously over their macaroni and chestnuts, were flying panic-smitten\r\nin all directions; some clasped their crucifixes, and called wildly upon\r\nthe saints for protection; others leaped frantically into boats and rowed\r\nthemselves dead, in the needless endeavor to escape death; while the\r\ngeneral expression of the people was that of a multitude who, the next\r\nminute, expected to see the skies fall to crush them, or the earth open to\r\nswallow them up forever. But I was myself unmoved,\" our friend concluded,\r\nin his usual vein of philosophy, \"though, I trust, not unsympathizing;\r\nbecause I saw, through those dun clouds of smoke, the stars still shining\r\nserenely aloft, and because I felt that after that transient convulsion of\r\nnature the great sun would rise as majestically as ever on the morrow, to\r\nshow us, here and there, no doubt, a beautiful tract now desolate, here and\r\nthere a fruitful vale now filled with ashes,--but also, the same glorious\r\nbay breathing calmly in its bed, the same cloudless sky holding the green\r\nand peaceful earth in its complacent embrace.\"\r\n\r\nWe could not, as we listened to the story of the traveller, help\r\nconsidering it an illustration of that great convulsion of finance\r\nwhich has visited us during the last month. We do not mean to call\r\nthis an eruption, which would scarcely be appropriate,--inasmuch as\r\nthe characteristic of it was not a preternatural activity, but rather a\r\npreternatural stagnation and paralysis; but there is certainly a striking\r\nsimilarity in the contrasts presented by the two pictures just painted, and\r\nthe contrasts presented in the condition of the commercial world as it is\r\nnow, and as it was only a few weeks since. Then all nature smiled, and we\r\nscarcely thought of the future in the happy consciousness of the present;\r\nwhereas now all nature seems to frown, and we eagerly long for the future\r\nto escape the endless vexations and miseries of the present. Our trade,\r\nwhich lately bloomed like a Neapolitan spring-day, is now covered with\r\nclouds and sifted with ashes, as if some angry Vesuvius had exploded its\r\ncontents over us and shot the hot lava-tides among our snug vineyards and\r\ncottages. May we not also, in this case, as in that, draw some consolation\r\nfrom the knowledge that the stars are still shining behind the smoke, and\r\nthat the sun will assuredly come up to-morrow, as it has come up on so\r\nmany morrows, for so many thousands of years? Convulsions, by the very\r\nfact of their violence, show that they are short-lived; and though we, who\r\nsuffer by them directly, are apt to derive the slenderest solace from the\r\nphilosophy which demonstrates their transientness, or their utility in\r\ncertain aspects, it is nevertheless profitable, for various reasons, to\r\nmake them a subject of remark.\r\n\r\nIn a season of great public calamity, moreover, everybody feels that he\r\nought to participate in it in some way, if not as a sufferer, then as a\r\nsympathizer, and, in either capacity, as a speculator upon its causes and\r\nprobable effects. The learned historian, Monsieur Alcofribas, who preserves\r\nfor our instruction \"the heroic deeds and prowesses\" of the great king of\r\nthe Dipsodes, tells us how that once, when Philip of Macedon threatened\r\nCorinth, the virtuous inhabitants of that city were thrown into mortal\r\nfear; but they were not too much paralyzed to forget the necessity of\r\ndefence; and while some fortified the walls, others sharpened spears, and\r\nothers again carried the baskets, the noble Diogenes, who was doubtless the\r\nchief literary man of the place, was observed to thwack and bang his tub\r\nwith unmerciful vehemence. When he was asked why he did so, he replied,\r\nthat it was for the purpose of showing that he was not a mere slug and lazy\r\nspectator, in a crowd so fervently exercised. In these times, therefore,\r\nwhen Philip of Macedon is not precisely thundering at our walls, but\r\nnibbling at every man's cupboard and cheese-press, it behooves each\r\nDiogenes to rattle his tub at least, in order to prove, in the spirit of\r\nhis prototype and master,\r\n\r\n  \"Though he be rid of fear,\r\n  He is not void of care.\"\r\n\r\nIf the noise he makes only add to the general turbulence and confusion, the\r\nshow of sympathy will at least go for something.\r\n\r\nThe same authority, whom we have just quoted, has a piece of advice with\r\nwhich we intend to set our tub in motion. \"Whatsoever,\" he says, \"those\r\nblindfolded, blockheady fools, the astrologers of Louvain, Nuremberg,\r\nTubingen, and Lyons, may tell you, don't you feed yourselves up with whims\r\nand fancies, nor believe there is any Governor of the whole universe this\r\nyear but God the Creator, who by his Word rules and governs all things, in\r\ntheir nature, propriety, and conditions, and without whose preservation and\r\ngovernance all things in a moment would be reduced to nothing, as out of\r\nnothing they were by him created.\" It is a most sound and salutary truth,\r\nnot to be forgotten in times of commercial distress, nor even in discussing\r\nfinancial questions, remote as they may seem to be from the domain of\r\nethics. God rules in the market, as he does on the mountain; he has\r\nprovided eternal laws for society, as he has for the stars or the seas;\r\nand it is just as impossible to escape him or his ways in Wall Street or\r\nState Street as it is anywhere else. We do not wish to suggest any improper\r\ncomparisons, but does not the Psalmist assert, \"If I make my bed in\r\n_sheol_, behold Thou art there\"?\r\n\r\nIn other words, commerce, the exchange of commodities, banking, and\r\nwhatever relates to it, currency, the rise and fall of prices, the rates\r\nof profits, are all subject to laws as universal and unerring as those\r\nwhich Newton deduces in the \"Principia,\" or Donald McKay applies in the\r\nconstruction of a clipper ship. As they are manifested by more complicated\r\nphenomena, man may not know them as accurately as he knows the laws of\r\nastronomy or mechanics; but he can no more doubt the existence of the\r\nformer than he can the existence of the latter; and he can no more\r\ninfringe the one than he can infringe the other with impunity. The poorest\r\nhousekeeper is perfectly well aware that certain rules of order are to\r\nbe observed in the management of the house, or else you will have either\r\nstarvation or the sheriff inside of it in a little time. But what means\r\nthat formidable, big-sounding phrase, Political Economy, more than national\r\nhousekeeping? Can you manage the immense, overgrown family of Uncle Sam\r\nwith less calculation, less regard to justice, prudence, thrift, than you\r\nuse in your own little affairs? Can you sail that tremendous vessel,\r\nthe Ship of State, without looking well to your chart and compass and\r\nNavigator's Guide?\r\n\r\nWhen the \"Central America\" sinks to the bottom of the sea with five hundred\r\nsouls on board, though it is in the midst of a terrible tempest, the public\r\ninstinct is inclined to impute the disaster less to the mysterious uproar\r\nof wind and wave than to some concealed defect in the vessel. Had she sunk\r\nin a tranquil ocean, while the winds were idle and the waves asleep, the\r\nincident would have produced a burst of indignation, above the deeper wail\r\nof sorrow, strong enough to sweep the guilty instruments of it out of\r\nexistence. The world would have felt that some great law of mechanics had\r\nbeen wilfully violated. But here is a whole commercial society suddenly\r\nwrecked, in a moment of general peace, after ten years of high, but not\r\nvery florid or very unwholesome prosperity, on the heel of an abundant\r\nrecompense to the efforts of labor,--when there has occurred no public\r\ncalamity, no war, no famine, no fire, no domestic insurrection, scarcely\r\none startling event, and when the interpositions of the government have\r\nbeen literally as unfelt as the dropping of the dew, a whole commercial\r\nsociety is wrecked; values sink to the bottom like the California gold\r\non the \"Central America\"; great money-corporations fall to pieces as\r\nher state-rooms and cabins fell to pieces; the relations of trade are\r\ndislocated as her ribs and beams were dislocated; and the people are cast\r\nupon an uncertain sea, as her passengers were cast,--not to struggle for\r\nphysical existence like them, but to endure an amount of anguish and\r\ndespair almost equal to what was endured by those unhappy victims.\r\n\r\nHow can this have happened arbitrarily, capriciously, mysteriously, without\r\nsome gross and positive violation of social law, some wilful and therefore\r\nwicked departure from the known principles of science? Every random\r\nconjecture as to the causes of the prevailing distress implies an answer\r\nto the question, and it need not be repeated. It is more important to\r\ninquire what those violations and departures have been, than to reiterate\r\nthe general principle. What has led to the lamentable results under which\r\nwe suffer? What has rendered the winds so tempestuous that they must needs\r\nblow down our noble ship? What has provoked the ire of those big bully\r\nwaves so that they advance to demolish us? Ah! hark just here how the\r\nDiogenidæ tumble and thump their tubs! each one rapping out his own tune;\r\neach one screaming to boot, to be heard above the din!\r\n\r\nOne cries, that we Americans are an unconscionably greedy people, ever\r\nhasting to get rich, never satisfied with our gains, and, in the frantic\r\neagerness of accumulation, disregarding alike justice, truth, probity, and\r\nmoderation. Under this impulse our trade becomes an incessant and hazardous\r\nadventure, like the stakes of the gambler upon the turn of the dice, or\r\nupon the figures of the sweat-cloth; a feverish impatience for success\r\npushes everything to the verge of ruin, and only after it has toppled over\r\nthe brink, and we have followed it, does the danger of the game we had\r\nbeen playing become apparent.--A second qualifies this view, and shouts,\r\nthat our vice is not so much greed, which is the vice of the miser, as\r\nextravagance, which is the vice of the spendthrift; and that as soon as\r\nwe get one dollar, we run in debt for ten. We must have fine houses,\r\nfine horses, fine millinery, fine upholstery, troops of servants, and\r\ngive costly dinners, and attend magnificent balls. Our very shops and\r\ncounting-houses must resemble the palaces of the Venetian nobility, and\r\nour dwellings be more royally arrayed than the dwellings of the mightiest\r\nmonarchs. When the time comes--as come it will--for paying for all this\r\nglorious frippery, we collapse, we wither, we fleet, we sink into the\r\nsand.--A third Diogenes, of a more practical turn of mind, vociferates,\r\nthat the whole thing comes from the want of a high protective tariff. These\r\nsubtle and malignant foreigners, who are so jealous of our progress, who\r\nare ever on the watch to ruin us, who make any quantity of goods at any\r\ntime, for nothing, and send them here just at the right moment, to swamp\r\nus irrecoverably, are the authors of the mischief, and ought to be kept\r\noutside of the nation by a triple wall of icebergs drawn around each\r\nport. They pour in upon us a flood of commodities, which destroys our\r\nmanufactures; they carry off all our gold and silver, which eviscerates the\r\nbanks; the banks squeeze the merchants, to the last drop of blood; and the\r\nmerchants perish in the process, carrying with them hosts of mechanics,\r\nfarmers, and professional men.--Not so, bellows a fourth philosopher,\r\nperhaps a little more seedy than the rest; it is all the work of \"the\r\ninfernal credit system,\"--of the practice of making money out of that\r\nwhich is only a promise to pay money,--out of that which purports to have\r\na real equivalent in some vault, when no such equivalent exists, and is,\r\ntherefore, a fraud on the face of it,--and which, deluging the community,\r\nraises the price of everything, begets speculation, stimulates an excessive\r\nand factitious trade, and is then suddenly withdrawn from the system, at\r\nthe height of its inflation, like wind sucked from a bladder, to leave it a\r\nmere flaccid, wrinkled, empty, worthless old film of fat!\r\n\r\nNow, for our part, we think all the Diogenidæ right, but not precisely in\r\nthe way in which they state the matter; and we think the seedy Diogenes\r\nthe rightest of all,--because he has struck nearest to the centre, to the\r\norganic fact which controls the other facts,--yet, without sharing his\r\nprejudice against credit, one of the blessedest of inventions. As a very\r\nlong and a very dull treatise, however, would scarcely suffice to explain\r\nall the reasons for our thinking so, we must devote the one or two pages\r\nthat are given us to a few simple, elementary, frontal principles,\r\nfamiliar, no doubt, to every one, and therefore the more important to be\r\nrecalled, when every one seems to have forgotten them. Nothing is better\r\nknown than the laws of gravitation; nothing staler in the repetition; but\r\nif the folk around us are building their houses so that they all fall down\r\nupon our heads, it behooves us to remind them of those laws.\r\n\r\n1. Human wisdom has discovered nothing clearer than this,--that in all the\r\noperations of trade above a primitive barter, you must have a standard or\r\nmeasure of values; and human ingenuity has never been able to devise any\r\nstandard more perfect, in essential respects, than the precious metals. It\r\nmay be doubted, indeed, whether the choice of these metals for currency\r\nis a result of human ingenuity. Paley and his school of theologians\r\ndemonstrate the existence, intelligence, and goodness of God from the\r\nevidences of design in creation,--from that nice adaptation of means to\r\nends which shows an infinite knowledge and infinite benevolence at work;\r\nbut no one of the instances in which they found their argument, from\r\nthe watch, which affords the primal illustration, to the human body,\r\nwhich furnishes the most complex confirmations, is a more astonishing or\r\nexquisite proof of pre-arrangement than is the adaptedness of gold and\r\nsilver to the purposes of currency. Your standard or measure, for instance,\r\nmust, in the first place, possess a certain uniformity; if it be a measure\r\nof capacity, it must not be of the size of a thimble in the morning, and as\r\nbig as a haystack at night, like the mystic bottle of the fairy tale; if\r\na measure of length, it must not be made of caoutchouc, as long as your\r\nfinger to-day, and as long as the Atlantic Cable to-morrow; and so, if a\r\nmeasure of value, it must not equal one thousand at ten o'clock, and equal\r\nzero at three. But the precious metals do possess this uniformity; they\r\nare not scarce, as diamonds are, so that a pinch of them might measure\r\nthe value of a city; nor are they as plenty as blackberries, so that a\r\nwagon-load could scarcely buy a fat goose for dinner. They cannot be washed\r\naway like a piece of soap, nor wear out like a bit of wampum, nor crumble\r\nlike agate or carnelian in dividing. In short, they combine all the\r\nadvantages that are needed, with few or none of the disadvantages that\r\nwould be troublesome, in a substance which is used for money. They possess\r\nintrinsic utility, they are equably supplied, they may be easily divided\r\nand then fused again, they take a stamp, and they retain the same qualities\r\neverywhere and at all times. Accordingly, all the civilized nations,\r\nfrom the time of great-great-great-grandfather Moses down to the time of\r\nPresident Buchanan, have used the precious metals for their standard of\r\nvalues; while your barbarians only, your silly Sandwich-islanders, your\r\nstupid troglodytes of interior Africa, your savage red men, have used for\r\nthat purpose fish-bones, beaver-skins, cowries, strings of beads, or a lump\r\nof old rags. Q.E.D., then, on Paley's principles, the precious metals were\r\nmeant by Divine Providence for use as money, at least more than anything\r\nelse, because nothing else is so well adapted to the end. Intelligent man\r\neverywhere has been glad to recognize the Divine teaching; and the American\r\nman--holding himself the most intelligent of all men--has incorporated\r\nthe lesson in his fundamental law. Nothing can be money for him,\r\nconstitutionally, but metal which has a genuine ring in it.\r\n\r\n2. Being the established standard, the precious metals, so long as they\r\ncontinue unchanged in amount, have a precise and definite relation to all\r\nother commodities. But they do not continue unchanged; and neither do\r\nother commodities continue unchanged. There is more gold at one time than\r\nanother, and more wheat at one time than another; so that the relation\r\nbetween the two is not a determinate, but a variable one; and it is this\r\nvariation which causes or constitutes the fluctuation of prices. If wheat\r\nincreases in quantity, more of it will be given for the same money; and if\r\nit decreases, less of it will be given for the same money; on the other\r\nhand, if money increases, more of it will be given for a specific quantity\r\nof wheat, and if it decreases, less will be given; while if they increase\r\nor decrease together, a relative equilibrium will be maintained. But the\r\nbeauty of the precious metals, as we have said, is that they are not liable\r\nto very sudden or considerable increase or decrease; only twice in the\r\ncourse of history, on the occasion of the discovery of the South American\r\nmines by the Spaniards, and of the California mines by the Americans,\r\nhas there been recorded an unusual production of gold and silver; and in\r\nboth cases, it is important to note, the same effect followed,--a very\r\nconsiderable enhancement of prices; that is, all other articles seemed to\r\ngrow dear, although the real fact was that money had only grown cheap. In\r\nSpain every commodity rose; everybody experienced that delicious feeling,\r\nwhich we sometimes enjoy in dreams, of going up without spring or effort;\r\nand Spain was considered to be enviably prosperous and happy. As for\r\nSan Francisco, we all remember the fabulous prices which ruled in that\r\nvicinity. An acquaintance of ours wrote us then, that he gave five dollars\r\nfor a dinner consisting of half a pullet and two potatoes, and when he\r\nadded a pint of champagne, it came to five dollars more. He allowed his\r\nwasherwoman one hundred and fifty dollars a month, paid fifty dollars for\r\na pair of second-hand cow-hide boots, and hired a cellar, seven feet by\r\nnine, and six feet under ground, at the rate of fifteen thousand dollars a\r\nyear. But both in Spain and in San Francisco this ludicrous exaggeration\r\nof values cured itself. The manufacturers and merchants of all the world\r\nsent their goods of all sorts to such tempting markets; and it was not\r\nlong before the goods, not the money, were in excess. Prices came down,\r\nas sailors say, by the run, and Spain and San Francisco were reduced once\r\nmore to rationality and comfort. These were exceptional cases, but they\r\nillustrate the general principle, that the increase of money raises prices,\r\nand the decrease of money lowers them, which is all we wish to state. In\r\nordinary cases, however, when the currency is in its normal condition, this\r\nrise and fall of prices is like the rise and fall of the tides, the mere\r\npulsations of the great sea, which drown and damage nobody, and rather keep\r\nthe waters more clear and wholesome by their gentle agitation.\r\n\r\n3. The same law is observed to operate, whenever anything is made, either\r\nby the decrees of government or the usages of society, to take the place of\r\nthe precious metals as money. Paper, in the shape of bank-bills, promising\r\nto pay money on demand, is the most frequent, because the most cheap\r\nand convenient substitute; accordingly, when convertible paper-money is\r\nincreased, it raises prices, and when it is diminished, it depresses\r\nprices, just as in the case of a metallic currency. But there are these\r\ntwo signal points of distinction between a paper and a metallic currency:\r\nfirst, that paper money may be increased or diminished much more easily\r\nthan metallic money; and, second, that any excess or deficiency of the\r\nformer is not so easily corrected by the natural operations of trade. The\r\nsudden or large increase of the metals is prevented by their scarcity and\r\nthe laborious processes necessary to produce them, and a sudden or large\r\ndecrease of them could be brought about only by some great public calamity\r\nwhich should destroy them or cause them to be hoarded. But paper money,\r\nwhether made by a government or made by authorized corporations, may be\r\nissued and put in circulation almost at will, and again be withdrawn\r\nat will. We do not mean that the issue and withdrawal of it are wholly\r\nunchecked, but that the checks, as the entire history of banking would seem\r\nto prove, are comparatively inefficient and delusive. If the rise and fall\r\nof prices, caused by the fluctuations of metallic money, are to be compared\r\nto the rise and fall of the tides, the rise and fall of paper prices are\r\nmore like the increase and decrease of steam in a boiler, which is an\r\nadmirable agent, but demanding an incessant and scientific control. The\r\nsea-tides, even after a tempest, will regulate themselves, because they\r\nhave all the oceans and all the rivers of the globe to draw upon; but the\r\nsteam in a boiler is a thing confined, and yet capable of immense and\r\ndestructive expansion. A metallic currency runs from nation to nation, and\r\nhas its perturbations corrected from nation to nation; but a paper currency\r\nis local, and cannot be so well corrected by the great interchanges of the\r\nglobe. Let us make this clearer in another way.\r\n\r\n4. It is universally conceded, by all the writers on finance, that any\r\nunusual production of currency occasions a rise of prices; the relative\r\nvalue of money is less than it was before, while the relative value of\r\nother articles is greater; a greater quantity of money is given for other\r\narticles, and fewer of other articles are given for the same amount of\r\nmoney. This rise has the double effect of provoking the importation\r\nof foreign commodities, and of preventing the exportation of domestic\r\ncommodities; inasmuch as the same enhancement of rates, which opens a good\r\ndomestic market for the former, closes the foreign market to the latter;\r\nand thus an unfavorable balance accumulates rapidly against the country\r\nwhere the rise occurs, in respect to other countries where it has not\r\noccurred. Now sooner or later this balance must be paid; and as products\r\ncannot be profitably shipped abroad to furnish a fund whereupon to\r\ndraw bills of exchange, it must be paid in coin. The coin is therefore\r\nabstracted from circulation; and if coin were the only currency, such an\r\nabstraction would of itself induce a fall of prices, which would operate as\r\na check upon importations until the old relation of equilibrium should be\r\nrestored. But where the government, or where individuals, whether organized\r\nor alone, have the power to replace the departed coin by issues of paper\r\nmoney, prices are for a while maintained, and importations continued as\r\nvigorously as ever. All this, however, is but a postponement of the day of\r\nsettlement. The balance to be extinguished is a substantial balance, which\r\ncan be discharged only by substantial means; a mere promise to pay, a mere\r\nsign and representative of debt, will not extinguish it, any more than the\r\nsmell of a cook-shop will extinguish a ravenous appetite. The insatiable\r\ncreditor will have money; and the depositories of that essential become,\r\nunder his assaults, more and more meagre and tenuous. The managers of\r\nthem at last get alarmed, and begin to withhold their issues of paper;\r\nwhich means that they begin to reduce their loans to the community. The\r\nmoney-market grows \"tight,\" as it is phrased; the money-world feels\r\ngenerally as if it had taken an overdose of persimmons. Merchants and\r\ndealers, shorn of their usual accommodations, are compelled to borrow at\r\nruinous usuries, or to fail to meet their payments. Their default involves\r\nothers; others fail, and others again. The bowels of the banks, with us\r\nthe great money-lenders, close with the snap and tenacity of steel-traps;\r\nand then a general panic, or want of commercial confidence, brings on a\r\nparalysis of the domestic exchanges, and wide-spread bankruptcy and ruin.\r\nImportations are checked, of course; but they are checked in a sharp,\r\nrapid, and violent way, accompanied by the most painful embarrassments and\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nThis we believe to be an outline of the history of all our commercial\r\ncatastrophes, stripped of those local and incidental circumstances which\r\nvary from time to time: over-issues of money,--speculative prosperity,--all\r\nthe world getting rich in the most agreeable manner,--fairy palaces rising\r\non all sides, without the sound of trowel or hammer; then,--the day of\r\nadjustment,--the rapid contraction of the currency,--all the world getting\r\npoor in the most drastic and disagreeable manner,--and those fairy palaces,\r\nwhich rose under our very eyelids over-night, vanishing, like the palace\r\nof Aladdin from the vision of the Grand-Seignior after he awoke in the\r\nmorning. But, alas! the revulsion does not stop with the overthrow of the\r\npalaces which had been reared without labor; it is not satisfied with the\r\ndissipation of mere fancies and dreams; but, being itself a most real\r\nthing, it carries with it many a stately structure, which the toil, the\r\neconomy, the self-denial of years had hardly raised. Extraneous causes,--a\r\nshort crop,--a reduced tariff,--a peculiar mania of enterprise,--may hasten\r\nor retard the various steps of the process which has been described; but\r\nits cause and its course are almost always the same, and the discerning\r\neye may easily detect them, from the beginning to the end of our modern\r\ncommercial experience. In the existing difficulties, in this country, the\r\nrailroad speculations have had much to do with producing and aggravating\r\nthe effect; but the primary source of it, we think, is to be found in the\r\nease with which our currency is inflated, under a banking system which\r\nvaries from State to State, and which, outside of New England and New York,\r\nwhere it is by no means perfect, is as bungling a contrivance, for the ends\r\nto be answered, as was ever inflicted on the patience of mankind. Much\r\nof the trouble is due also to the extravagance and reckless waste of our\r\npeople, which, though owing in some degree to our want of good manners and\r\ngood taste, are directly traceable to the stimulus given to expense by the\r\nover-issue of artificial money. While the paper which passes for money is\r\nplenty, and every man can easily get \"accommodations\" from the banks, we\r\nsquander without thought. No matter how costly the articles we buy; the\r\nexpansion of the currency is greater than the rise in market values; and it\r\nis only when the contraction comes that we see how foolishly lavish we have\r\nbeen.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the remedy? \"Why, away with paper currency altogether!\" says\r\none. Yes,--tear up your Croton-water-pipes, because the breaking of a main\r\nsometimes submerges your dwellings; destroy your railroads, because the\r\ntrains sometimes run off the track; arrest your steamships, because an\r\n\"Arctic\" and a \"Central America\" go disastrously down into the deep,\r\ndeep sea! That were not wise, surely; that were very unwise, even were\r\nit possible, which it is not.--\"Give us a high protective tariff,\" says\r\nanother. Most certainly, friend, if we are to be perpetually flooded with\r\npaper, a high tariff is needed;--your theory is at least consistent,\r\nhowever it may have worked in practice. But a high protective tariff is\r\nan impossibility, because it can be attained only by favor of the Federal\r\nlegislature; and, as we all know, at the door of that legislature stands\r\nthe inexorable shape of the Slave Power, which consults no interest but\r\nits own in the management of government, and which will never make a\r\nconcession to the manufacturers or the merchants of the North, unless it be\r\nto purchase some new act of baseness, or bind them in some new chains of\r\nservility.--But have you inquired whether that flood of paper is necessary?\r\nWe frankly tell you that we do not believe it is; we believe that a better\r\nsystem is possible,--to be brought about, not by greater restrictions\r\non banking, but by greater freedom; and we only regret that we have not\r\nnow space to discuss that faith with you in all its reasons and results.\r\nWe hope to be permitted to do so at some other time. Meanwhile, let us\r\nrejoice that the whole subject is in a position to be frankly discussed. A\r\nfew years ago, when the question of the currency was a question of party\r\npolitics, there was no aspect in which it could be presented, which did\r\nnot arouse all the restless jealousies of party prejudice. If you talked\r\nof hard-money, you were denounced as a Benton bullionist; if you talked\r\nof credit, you were called a Whig banker, plotting to devour the poor;\r\nand the calmest phrases of science were turned into the shibboleths of an\r\ninternecine warfare. A better hour has come, and let us improve it to our\r\nmutual edification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSONNET.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Maple puts her corals on in May,\r\n  While loitering frosts about the lowlands cling,\r\n  To be in tune with what the robins sing,\r\n  Plastering new log-huts 'mid her branches gray;\r\n  But when the Autumn southward turns away,\r\n  Then in her veins burns most the blood of Spring,\r\n  And every leaf, intensely blossoming,\r\n  Makes the year's sunset pale the set of day.\r\n  O Youth unprescient, were it only so\r\n  With trees you plant, and in whose shade reclined,\r\n  Thinking their drifting blooms Fate's coldest snow,\r\n  You carve dear names upon the faithful rind,\r\n  Nor in that vernal stem the cross foreknow\r\n  That Age may bear, silent, yet unresigned!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROUND TABLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was said long ago, that poets, like canaries, must be starved in order\r\nto keep them in good voice, and, in the palmy days of Grub Street, an\r\neditor's table was nothing grander than his own knee, on which, in his airy\r\ngarret, he unrolled his paper-parcel of dinner, happy if its wrapping were\r\na sheet from Brown's last poem, and not his own. Now an editorial table\r\nseems to mean a board of green cloth at which literary broken-victuals are\r\nserved out with no carving but that of the editorial scissors.\r\n\r\n_La Maga_ has her table, too, and at fitting times invites to it her\r\nvarious Eminent Hands. It is a round table,--that is, rounded by the\r\nprinciple of rotation,--for how could she settle points of precedence with\r\nthe august heads of her various Departments without danger of the dinner's\r\ngrowing cold? Substantial dinners are eaten thereat with Homeric appetite,\r\nnor, though _impletus venter non vult studere libenter_, are the visits of\r\nthe Muse unknown. At these feasts no tyranny of speech-making is allowed,\r\nbut the _bonbons_ are all wrapped in original copies of verses by various\r\ncontributors, which, having served their festive turn, become the property\r\nof the guests. Reporters are not admitted, for the eating is not done\r\nfor inspection, like that of the hapless inmates of a menagerie; but\r\n_La Maga_ herself sometimes brings away in her pocket a stanza or so which\r\nshe esteems worthy of a more general communication. Last month she thus\r\nsequestered the following Farewell addressed by Holmes to the historian of\r\nWilliam the Silent.\r\n\r\n  Yes, we knew we must lose him,--though friendship may claim\r\n  To blend her green leaves with the laurels of fame;\r\n  Though fondly, at parting, we call him our own,\r\n  'Tis the whisper of love when the bugle has blown.\r\n\r\n  As the rider that rests with the spur on his heel,--\r\n  As the guardsman that sleeps in his corselet of steel,--\r\n  As the archer that stands with his shaft on the string,\r\n  He stoops from his toil to the garland we bring.\r\n\r\n  What pictures yet slumber unborn in his loom\r\n  Till their warriors shall breathe and their beauties shall bloom,\r\n  While the tapestry lengthens the life-glowing dyes\r\n  That caught from our sunsets the stain of their skies!\r\n\r\n  In the alcoves of death, in the charnels of time,\r\n  Where flit the gaunt spectres of passion and crime,\r\n  There are triumphs untold, there are martyrs unsung,\r\n  There are heroes yet silent to speak with his tongue!\r\n\r\n  Let us hear the proud story that time has bequeathed\r\n  From lips that are warm with the freedom they breathed!\r\n  Let him summon its tyrants, and tell us their doom,\r\n  Though he sweep the black past like Van Tromp with his broom!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  The stream flashes by, for the west-winds awake\r\n  On pampas, on prairie, o'er mountain and lake,\r\n  To bathe the swift bark, like a sea-girdled shrine,\r\n  With incense they stole from the rose and the pine.\r\n\r\n  So fill a bright cup with the sunlight that gushed\r\n  When the dead summer's jewels were trampled and crushed:\r\n  THE TRUE KNIGHT OF LEARNING,--the world holds him dear,--\r\n  Love bless him, Joy crown him, God speed his career!\r\n\r\n  _Aug. 8, 1857._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERARY NOTICES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Greyson Letters_, Selections from the Correspondence of R.E.H.\r\nGREYSON, ESQ. Edited by HENRY ROGERS, Author of \"The Eclipse of Faith,\" &c.\r\nBoston: Gould & Lincoln. 1 vol. 12mo.\r\n\r\nWe are assured in the American preface to this volume, that while it\r\nexhibits Henry Rogers as the peer of Butler as a reasoner, it also shows\r\nhim not inferior to Lamb as a humorist. Much as we are inclined to echo\r\nthe critical decisions of prefaces, we regret being unable to indorse this\r\nconfident statement. In amplitude, vigor, and fertility of thought we must\r\nthink the author of the \"Analogy\" holds some slight advantages over the\r\nauthor of \"The Eclipse of Faith\"; and we seriously doubt if the lovers of\r\nCharles Lamb will be likely to rush into mirthful ecstasies over the humor\r\nof \"The Greyson Letters.\" But we suppose that Henry Rogers himself would\r\nmake no pretensions to the rank of a writer, or reasoner, or humorist of\r\nthe first class. Far from being a great man, he occasionally slips into\r\nthe prejudices of quite a little one, and he never wholly puts off the\r\npedagogue and puts on the philosopher. Without much original force of\r\nnature, and never unmistakably stamping his own image and superscription\r\neither on his arguments or his language, he is still a well-trained\r\ntheological scholar, a skilful logician, and one of that class of\r\nelegant writers who neither offend the taste nor kindle the soul. As a\r\ncontroversialist on themes which are now engaging popular attention, he\r\ngrasps the questions he discusses at one or two removes from their centre\r\nand heart, where they pass out of the sphere of ideas and pass into the\r\nregion of opinions; and in this region he is candid to the extent of his\r\nperceptions, quick to detect the weak points in the formal statements\r\nof his opponents, and, without touching the vitalities of the matter in\r\ncontroversy, is always hailed as victor by those who agree with him, but\r\nrarely convinces the doubters and deniers he aims to convert. \"The Greyson\r\nLetters\" are evidently the work of an amiable, learned, accomplished, and\r\nable man, interested in a wide variety of themes which especially attract\r\nthe attention of thinkers, but in his treatment of them indicating a lack\r\nof deep and wide experience, and of that close, searching thought which\r\npierces to the core of a subject, and broods patiently over its living\r\nelements and relations, before it assumes to take them as materials for\r\nargumentation. This broad grasp of premises, which implies a penetrating\r\nand interpretative as well as dialectic mind, is the distinguishing\r\ndifference between a great reasoner and an able logician. In regard to the\r\nform of the work, we can see no reason why its essays should be thrown\r\ninto the shape of letters. The epistolary spirit vanishes almost as soon\r\nas \"Dear Sir\" and \"Dear Madam\" create its expectation. The author's mind\r\nis grave by nature and culture, and is sprightly, as it seems to us, by\r\ncompulsion and laborious levity. His nature has none of the richness and\r\njuiciness, none of the instinctive soul of humor, which must have vent in\r\nthe ludicrous. Occasionally an adversary or adverse dogma is demolished\r\nwith excellent logic, and then comes a dismal grin or chuckle at the feat,\r\nwhich hardly reminds us of the sly, shy smile of Addison, or the frolic\r\nintelligence which laughs in the victorious eyes of Pascal. Still, with all\r\nabatements, \"The Greyson Letters\" make a book well worthy of being read,\r\ncontain much admirable matter and suggestive thought, and might be allowed\r\nto pass muster among good books of the second class, did they not come\r\nbefore us with professions that seemed to invite the tests applicable to\r\nthe first.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Essays in Biography and Criticism_. By PETER BAYNE, M.A., Author of \"The\r\nChristian Life, Social and Individual,\" &c. First Series. Boston: Gould &\r\nLincoln. 1 vol. 12mo.\r\n\r\nThis volume contains essays on De Quincey, Tennyson and his Teachers, Mrs.\r\nBarrett Browning, Glimpses of Recent British Art, John Ruskin, Hugh Miller,\r\nThe Modern Novel, and Currer Bell. Though of various degrees of merit,\r\nthey all evince careful study and patient thought, and are written with\r\nconsiderable brilliancy and eloquence. As a critic, Mr. Bayne is generally\r\ncandid, conscientious, and intelligent, with occasional remarks evincing\r\ndelicacy and depth of thought; but his perceptions are not always\r\ntrustworthy, and his judgments are frequently of doubtful soundness. Thus\r\nwhen we are told that Wordsworth owed his fame to his moral elevation\r\nrather than to his \"intellectual or æsthetic capacities,\" and that there is\r\nhardly an instance of the highest creative imagination in the whole range\r\nof his poetry,--when we are informed that since Shakspeare no one \"has laid\r\nbare the burning heart of passion\" so perfectly as Byron,--and when the\r\nquestion is triumphantly asked, \"Where, out of Shakspeare, can we find\r\nsuch a series of female portraits as those\" in Bulwer's \"Rienzi,\"--we feel\r\ninclined, in this association of Byron and Bulwer with Shakspeare, and this\r\noversight of Wordsworth's claim to represent the highest original elements\r\nin the English poetry of the present century, to dispute Mr. Bayne's right\r\nto assume the chair of interpretative criticism. But still there are so\r\nmany examples in his book of fine and true perception, and so evident a\r\nsympathy with intellectual excellence and moral beauty, that we do not\r\nfeel disposed to quarrel with him on account of the apparent erroneousness\r\nof some of his separate opinions. Besides, his work is written in a style\r\nwhich will recommend it to a class of readers who are not especially\r\ninterested in the subjects of which it treats, and it cannot fail to\r\nstimulate in them a desire to know more of the great writers of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_White Lies. A Novel_. By Charles Reade. Boston: Ticknor & Fields. 1 vol.\r\n12mo.\r\n\r\nThe early chapters of this novel lack the brisk movement, the sparkling\r\ncompactness, the stinging surprises of Mr. Reade's usual style, but he\r\nkindles and condenses as he proceeds. As a whole, the work compares\r\nfavorably with his most brilliant compositions. He is a writer difficult to\r\ncriticize, because his defects are pleasing defects. Dogmatism is commonly\r\noffensive, and Mr. Reade's dogmatism is of the most uncompromising, not to\r\nsay insulting character; yet it is exhibited in connection with insight\r\nso sure and vivid, that we pardon the positiveness of the assertion for\r\nthe truth of what is asserted. Then he has a way of forcing Nature, much\r\nagainst her wish, to be epigrammatic,--of producing startling effects by\r\nartifices almost theatrical; and though his devices are obvious, they are\r\nmore than forgiven for the genuine power and real naturalness behind the\r\nrhetorical masquerade. Other men's freaks and eccentricities lead to the\r\ndistortion of truth and the confusion of relations, but Mr. Reade has\r\nfreaks of wisdom and eccentricities of practical sagacity. Occasionally\r\nhe has a stroke of observation that comes like a flash of lightning,\r\nblasting and shattering in an instant a prejudice or hypocrisy which was\r\nstrong enough to resist all the arguments of reason and all the appeals\r\nof humanity. \"White Lies\" is full of examples of his power, and of the\r\npeculiarities of his power. Blunt and bold and arrogant as his earnestness\r\noften appears, it is capable of the most winning gentleness, the most\r\ndelicate grace, and the most searching pathos. The delineation of the\r\nfemale characters in this novel is especially admirable. Josephine\r\nand Laure are exquisite creations, and the Baroness and Jacintha,\r\nthough different, are almost as perfect, considered as examples of\r\ncharacterization. In the invention and management of incidents, the\r\nauthor exhibits a sure knowledge of the means and contrivances by which\r\nexpectation is stimulated, and the interest of the story kept from\r\nflagging. We hope to read many more novels from the same pen as delightful\r\nas \"White Lies.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Brazil and the Brazilians_. Portrayed in Historical and Descriptive\r\nSketches. By Rev. D.P. Kidder, D.D., and Rev. J.C. Fletcher. Illustrated by\r\none hundred and fifty Engravings. Philadelphia: Childs & Peterson. 1 vol.\r\n8vo.\r\n\r\nBrazil is a country but little known to the majority of readers, and the\r\nlittle that is known is so fragmentary that it is as likely to convey a\r\nfalse idea as an incomplete one. The writers of this volume combine two\r\nqualifications for the work of dissipating this ignorance. They have a\r\ndirect personal knowledge of Brazil, gained during a long residence in\r\nthe country, and they have carefully studied every valuable book on its\r\nhistory and resources. The manners, customs, laws, government, productions,\r\nliterature, art, and religion of the people have all been carefully\r\nobserved under circumstances favorable for accurate investigation. The\r\nresult is a valuable, interesting, and attractive volume, well worthy of\r\nbeing extensively read. The elegance of its mechanical execution, and the\r\nprofusion of engravings illustrating the text, will add to its popularity,\r\nif not to its value.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_The Poetical Works of Leigh Hunt_. Now first entirely collected. Revised\r\nby himself, and edited, with an Introduction, by S. ADAMS LEE. Boston:\r\nTicknor & Fields. 2 vols. 18mo.\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt has outlived all the enmities and enemies provoked either by his\r\nmerits or his demerits, and is especially interesting as the sole survivor\r\nof the illustrious company of poets with whom the mind instinctively\r\nassociates him. Some burnt out; some died out; some dried up; but he\r\nremains the same cosey, chirping, fine-natured, and self-pleased singer,\r\nwho won the love of Shelley and Keats, and roused the wrath of Gifford and\r\nWilson. We are glad to welcome his collected poems in their appropriate\r\nattire of \"blue and gold,\" and trust they will have a wide circulation\r\nin the United States, as the genial poet is himself to be a participant\r\nin the profits of the publication. We wish that a word of ours could\r\nbe influential in assisting this veteran of letters to reap from the\r\npublication something more substantial than fame, yet in some degree the\r\nexpression of it,--something which shall give him assurance that his\r\nvolumes are on thousands of parlor tables, because the proofs of it are\r\npalpable in the increased comforts afforded to his old age. And certainly\r\nthe poet deserves a wide circle of readers. Though he does not succeed in\r\nthe delineation of the great and grand passions of our nature, he is very\r\nsuccessful in the sphere of its humane and tender sentiments; and though\r\nopen to criticism for the jaunty audacity with which he coins dainty\r\nsweetnesses of expression rejected by all dictionaries, and for an\r\noccasional pertness in asserting opinions of doubtful truth, he is so\r\nlovable a creature that we pardon his literary foibles as we would pardon\r\nthe personal foibles of a charming companion and friend. He has a genuine\r\nlove for all cheerful and cheering things, and power enough to infuse his\r\ncheer into other minds. Disliking all internal and external foes to human\r\ncomfort, he is equally the enemy of evil, and of the morbid discontent\r\nwhich springs from the bitter contemplation of evil. His nature is\r\nessentially sprightly and sensuous, with here a bit of Suckling and there a\r\nbit of Fletcher, carrying us back to an elder period of British poetry by\r\nthe careless grace and freedom of his movement, and proving his connection\r\nwith the present by the openness of his mind to all liberal thought and\r\nphilanthropic feeling. Good-humor and benevolence are so dominant in his\r\nnature, that they prevent him from having any deep perceptions of evil and\r\ncalamity. He is personally affronted when he sees the thunder-cloud push\r\naway the sunshine from life; and God, to him, is not only absolute Good,\r\nbut absolute Good Nature.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to quote passages from these volumes illustrative of his\r\nacute observation, his largeness of sympathy, his delicacy and daintiness\r\nof touch, his sweetness, humor, pathos, and fancy. As a specimen of the\r\nplayful and beautiful ingenuity of his mind, we extract a portion of his\r\nlittle poem on \"Love-Letters made of Flowers.\"\r\n\r\n  \"An exquisite invention this,\r\n  Worthy of Love's most honeyed kiss,\r\n  This art of writing _billets-doux_\r\n  In buds and odors and bright hues!\r\n  In saying all one feels and thinks\r\n  In clever daffodils and pinks;\r\n  In puns of tulips; and in phrases,\r\n  Charming for their truth, of daisies;\r\n  Uttering, as well as silence may,\r\n  The sweetest words the sweetest way.\r\n  How fit, too, for the lady's bosom!\r\n  The place where _billets-doux_ repose 'em.\r\n\r\n  \"What delight, in some sweet spot\r\n  Combining _love_ with _garden_ plot,\r\n  At once to cultivate one's flowers\r\n  And one's epistolary powers!\r\n  Growing one's own choice words and fancies\r\n  In orange tubs and beds of pansies;\r\n  One's sighs and passionate declarations\r\n  In odorous rhetoric of carnations;\r\n  Seeing how far one's stocks will reach;\r\n  Taking due care one's flowers of speech\r\n  To guard from blight as well as bathos,\r\n  And watering every day one's pathos!\"\r\n\r\nFrom the exquisite little poem entitled \"Songs of the Flowers\" we should\r\nlike to cut a few stanzas; but our limits forbid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSIC.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat will the Muses do in these hard times? Must they cease to hold court\r\nin opera-house and concert-room, because stocks fall, factories and banks\r\nstop, credit is paralyzed, and princely fortunes vanish away like bubbles\r\non the swollen tide of speculation? Must Art, too, bear the merchant's\r\npenalties? or shall not rather this ideal, feminine element of life, shall\r\nnot Art, like woman, warm and inspire a sweeter, richer, more ideal, though\r\nit be a humbler home for us, with all the tenderer love and finer genius,\r\nnow that man's enterprise is wrecked abroad? Shall we have no Music? Has\r\nthe universal \"panic\" griped the singers' throats, that they can no longer\r\nvibrate with the passionate and perfect freedom indispensable to melody?\r\nIt must not be. The soul is too rich in resources to let all its interests\r\nfail because one fails. If business and material speculation have been\r\noverdone, if we are checked and flung down in these mad endeavors to\r\naccumulate vast means of living, we shall have time to pick ourselves up,\r\ncompose ourselves to some tranquillity and some humility, and actually,\r\nwith what small means we have, begin to _live_. Panic strangles life, and\r\nthe money-making fever always tends to panic. Panic is the great evil\r\nnow, and panic needs a panacea. What better one can we invent than music?\r\nIt were the very madness of economy to cut off that. Some margin every\r\nlife must have, around this everlasting sameness of the dull page of\r\nnecessity,--some opening into the free infinite of joy and careless\r\nideality, or the very life-springs dry up.\r\n\r\nMusic is a cheap luxury; the more so as one seeks real music for its own\r\nsake, and not the music which is imported like the Paris fashions. This\r\nwinter it will be a question between whether we can afford to pay for it,\r\nand whether we can afford to do without it. We think the absolute necessity\r\nof some diversion, something to lift the leaden cloud, and keep us in a\r\nstate of natural buoyancy and courage, already settles the question. Music\r\nwe shall have, simply because we need it. Or view it from the opposite\r\nside, from the point of mere political economy. Music, in many ways, has\r\nbuilt itself up into a great industry among us,--music-publishers, musical\r\ninstrument-makers, music teachers, musical performers,--all mutually\r\ndependent, and together swelling the national industry to the amount of\r\nmany millions. It is the opportunities of hearing music, it is the concerts\r\nand the operas, that give the impulse to this whole many-branched machine.\r\nTaken together, it feeds many mouths, and helps turn many other very\r\ndifferent sort of mills, and plays its part in Wall Street and in State\r\nStreet, and its _notes_ in that sense enter as much into the general\r\ncurrency as they do into the general ear in another. Now which is cheaper,\r\nwhich is wiser, to employ these artists, and the crowds of workers whom\r\nthe public exercise of their talent keeps in motion, or cast them off upon\r\nsociety to be a general burden in a more hopeless form? Surely, we can\r\nafford the stoppage of some banks and factories, quite as well as we can\r\nthat of music. Let us look around, then, upon its prospects for the winter.\r\n\r\nWhile we write (the first week in October) the musical season, in what we\r\ntake to be the most music-loving of our cities, Boston, has not commenced,\r\nor shaped itself into much distinctness of plan. The season is late;\r\nhard times may make it later; yet shall \"the winter of our discontent be\r\nglorious summer\" ere long. Boston, for its best music,--best in artistic\r\ntendency, though not perhaps the most exciting or most fashionable,--has\r\nalways relied more than New York on its own quiet, domestic resources. Our\r\nmusical societies have been the centres of our musical activity, and have\r\nmore or less successfully provided us with sterling opportunities of making\r\nourselves acquainted with the master compositions in the various forms\r\nof Oratorio, Orchestra, Chamber Music, etc., where the end has been more\r\nto get at the intrinsic worth and beauty of the music, than to go into\r\nfashionable raptures about some new-come singer or solo-playing virtuoso.\r\nYet virtuosodom and the Italian opera come in to reap an annual harvest\r\nhere too, and have and long will have their zealous party of admirers.\r\nWere Opera an organized home industry among us, as much as other forms of\r\nmusic,--were there some meaning in the name \"Academy of Music\" worn by\r\noperatic theatres, it would be more useful to our artistic progress. But\r\nItalian Opera, as managed, and \"star\" concerts generally, are no part of\r\nthe healthy, permanent development of our own musical resources. They\r\nare speculations; they attack us from without, exploiting a factitious\r\nenthusiasm, and exhausting the soil in one short season, so they may only\r\ncarry off the present fatness of the land. Operas and virtuoso concerts\r\nare wholly in the hands of speculators, musical Jew-brokers, who do a\r\nformidable business in old clothes, the worn-out musical celebrities of\r\nEurope;--often with great skill, often much to our pleasure and advantage;\r\nfor it is much to us to hear great artists, even when the voice has lost\r\nsome of its freshness, and to admire now what long ago perhaps exhausted\r\nadmiration in the Old World. But the effect is bad on our domestic\r\nindustry. We almost need a musical protective system. Our good old society\r\nconcerts have been much thrown out of joint. Few of them of late, as\r\ncompared with former years, have paid. The dazzling novelties, that come\r\ntrumpeted with all the cunning speculators' arts, debauch us somewhat from\r\nour wholesome, quiet love of pure, high music for its own sake, and lead\r\nthe public into little short-lived fanaticisms about certain prima donnas,\r\nbaritones, or tenors, and about music chiefly made to show off the singer,\r\nfull of the commonplaces that he loves to make \"effect\" in,--fanaticisms\r\nalternating with _blasé_ indifference. But this would lead us into a long\r\ndiscussion, and it is our wish here to avoid vexed questions. For\r\nthe present we will avow no sides, of German or Italian, \"light\" or\r\n\"classical.\"\r\n\r\nThe lovers of opera have something to look forward to in Boston; what, we\r\nshall see when we survey the field elsewhere. Our noble Boston theatre\r\nmust needs be one point in the triangular campaign of the three cities.\r\nAnd here we may allude, _en passant_, to the prospect of one novelty that\r\nought to interest our opera-lovers who are weary of the usual hackneyed\r\n_répertoire_. Our townsman, Mr. L. H. Southard, the composer of \"The\r\nScarlet Letter,\" has also written an Italian opera, on an Oriental subject,\r\nwith the title \"Omano,\" the libretto by Signor Manetta, founded on\r\nBeckford's \"Vathek.\" A private or subscription concert will soon give an\r\nopportunity of hearing some of its scenas, quatuors, etc. To come back,\r\nthen, to what is more peculiarly Bostonian in the way of music,--what\r\nconcerts shall we have? Of large societies, the only one remaining now\r\nin operative force is the oldest and the largest, the Handel and Haydn\r\nSociety. This set the right example last May, in that splendid three-days'\r\nFestival, of true domestic musical enterprise, organizing the whole thing\r\non the basis of internal and domestic means, with our own permanent nucleus\r\nof orchestra and chorus, and drawing from without such other talent, such\r\nsolo singers, as were needed for the right interpretation of the noble\r\nmusic, and not merely for their own private exhibition and profit. This was\r\ngenuine; this was wholesome; and the success warrants the best hopes for\r\nanother season. Carl Zerrahn, the excellent conductor upon that occasion,\r\nis on his way home from Germany (his _old_ home) with new stock of zeal and\r\nof new music, and the oratorio rehearsals will at once begin. It is event\r\nenough for one winter, the single fact that Handel's \"Israel in Egypt,\"\r\nthat mightiest oratorio, which is one mountain range of sublime choruses,\r\nwill be the chief subject of study. It is proposed to give at least four\r\nSunday-evening performances, consisting of \"The Messiah,\" of course, at\r\nChristmas; Costa's \"Eli,\" or \"Elijah\"; the \"Requiem\" of Mozart, and the\r\n\"Lobgesang\" by Mendelssohn; and for the last, and we trust many last,\r\n\"Israel in Egypt.\" All this will be but so much rehearsal for the grander\r\nFestival to follow. We have no organized orchestral or symphony society,\r\nas we should have; but we have with us always the elements of a good\r\norchestra, who always work well together, and never better than last\r\nyear under the enterprise and drill of Mr. Zerrahn. Then we had glorious\r\nsymphonies and overtures, both old and new; and we shall have as good, and\r\nstill more brilliant concerts soon, if hard times do not daunt the leader's\r\nvery sanguine purpose. As a pendant, too, to the orchestral evenings, will\r\ncome cheap afternoon concerts in the Music Hall, where good symphonies\r\nand overtures, with sparkling varieties for younger tastes, will hold out\r\nweekly invitation.\r\n\r\nFor the select few, who hold communion in the love of classical quartet\r\nand trio music by the great masters,--in the piano poems of Chopin,\r\nMendelssohn, and Beethoven, there will be abundant opportunities. The\r\nMendelssohn Quintette Club, the German Trio, Mr. Satter, the pianist,\r\nand would we might add Otto Dresel, will give series of concerts in the\r\npleasant Chickering Saloon, that holds two hundred. Alas! we may be\r\ndisappointed there. The Masonic Temple has been sold to the government for\r\na United States Court-house. Think of the musical associations that haunt\r\nand consecrate the place, and think of the uses to which it may soon be\r\nput! What profanation! Hitherto the only _chains_ that have surrounded that\r\nTemple have been chains of harmony, which one may wear and not be a slave!\r\nIt has been a Temple of Concord;--may we hope that it will be in truth a\r\nTemple of Justice!--For virtuoso concerts, we shall have what the managers\r\nat New York send us. We shall of course have Vieuxtemps and Thalberg, if no\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nIn New York the campaign has been opened for this month past, and we do not\r\nyet hear that the troubles down in Wall Street have discouraged the lessees\r\nof the Academy of Music. Great is the array of singers and of players that\r\nrevolve around the little knot of musical speculators in New York. Strange\r\nto say, Italian opera has German managers. They catch the birds, having\r\nbeforehand caught and prepared the public. But it is as well to state, that\r\nthere are _two_ great operatic enterprises, as there are two rival musical\r\nbroker managers: to wit, Maretzek and Ullman; the former backed by Marshall\r\nof the Philadelphia Academy, and proceeding forth with hope to conquer\r\nfrom that centre; the latter backed by Thalberg, and strengthened by the\r\nStrakosch and Vestvali tributaries that roll proudly in from scenes of\r\nconquest in the Western States and Mexico. The Ullman party hold the New\r\nYork Academy; the other party hold the theatres of Philadelphia and Boston;\r\neither must make itself felt at the three points, to avoid a losing game.\r\nHence these harmonious and deadly rivals have perforce entered into a\r\nleague of amity and commerce, whereby they exchange singers, so that all\r\nshall in turn be heard at every theatre. At New York the company includes,\r\nfor leading soprani, Madame Lagrange, the wonder of the last two years,\r\ngreatest of vocal gymnasts, and fine actress always, with voice well worn,\r\nand Madame Frezzolini, as the last imported celebrity from Europe; her\r\nvoice, too, is past its prime, but her art is pronounced immaculate, and\r\nshe is quite a charmer, if we may trust the critics. For contralto there\r\nis Vestvali, the dashing tall one, who delights in man's clothes, and\r\nsings Charles the Fifth, the baritone (!) rôle in \"Ernani.\" There is a\r\ndelicate new tenor, Labocetta, and another named Maccaferri, and a fresh,\r\nuniversally admired baritone, Gassier; and there is our old buffo friend,\r\nRocco, and many more. Besides whom are two famous announcements, yet to\r\ncome from Europe: the French tenor, Roger, and the German basso, Formes.\r\nThe orchestra and chorus are, we suppose, as usual; the conductor better;\r\nhe is Herr Anschütz, who has had experience in London, and who subdues his\r\norchestra to sympathetic support of the singers. With Max it is the other\r\nway; he loves to ride full swing upon the top of his forces, brass and\r\nall, _fortissimo_, conquering and to conquer. Is \"Il Trovatore\" wanted,\r\neverlasting \"Trovatore,\"--music that whirls and fascinates, possessed\r\nand driven by one fixed idea of burning at the stake, with furies of\r\nlove and jealousy to match,--they borrow from the other company (under\r\nthe \"amicable\" treaty) Brignoli, of the golden tenor voice, who sings\r\nso sweetly and sulks so proudly lazy, and Amodio, that ton of juvenile\r\nhumanity, whose weighty baritone and eagerness to please make up for the\r\nsee-saw alternation of his two only expressions and gesticulations,--those\r\nof vulgar love-making and mock-heroical revenge. These, with Gazzaniga, the\r\ncharming, lively, natural Gazzaniga, whose voice _is_ fresh, and who can\r\nsing and act so charmingly in genial music, such as Donizetti's \"Elisir d'\r\nAmore,\" with also Assoni, the buffo, and Coletti, the bass, compose the\r\nyear-old and tried nucleus of the Philadelphia opera, which opened the\r\nfirst Monday in October. To these are added new attractions, in the shape\r\nof old celebrities from Europe: namely, Ronconi, the great _Don Giovanni_\r\nof the London opera; Tagliafico, the basso; Stecchi-Bottardi, tenor from\r\nHer Majesty's; Signora Ramos, prima donna from Turin; Signora Tagliafico;\r\nand greatest of all, to come when he has got through with the Russians, the\r\nfamous tenor, Tamberlik.\r\n\r\nHere is a great array, and great expense. Verily, it rains \"stars,\" as it\r\nrains meteors in our cold November nights. Perhaps it will pay,--perhaps\r\nnot. But for the interests of Art, and the true gratification and\r\nadvancement of the taste for music, one might ask whether a better economy\r\nof means would not have dictated fewer \"stars,\" and more completeness in\r\nthe orchestra, the chorus, and the general _ensemble_, so that we might for\r\nonce hear and enjoy _an opera_, and not merely a few singers lifted up on\r\nthe cheapest platform of an opera, loosely nailed together for their sakes.\r\nAnd this question leads to another consideration of still more importance\r\nto the real interests of Art. What music, what operas shall we hear? So\r\nfar, it has been the same old story, the same hackneyed round of \"Norma,\"\r\nand \"Lucia,\" and \"Lucrezia Borgia,\" and \"Ernani,\" and \"Trovatore,\" and so\r\non, with once or twice the ever genial and sparkling \"Il Barbiere.\" The\r\nwhole attraction lies (as always in these great musical _speculations_) in\r\nthe solo singers. These ever place themselves between you and good music;\r\nthey choose to sing the music that best shows their powers, no matter how\r\nfamiliar, hackneyed, sentimental, commonplace, and trashy. If you call for\r\n\"William Tell,\" for the \"Nozzi di Figaro,\" to say nothing of \"Fidelio,\" or\r\n\"Oberon,\" or \"Freischütz,\" they have not the organization for it, have not\r\nthe chorus, the secondary singers, the artists who know and love the music;\r\nit will not pay, and so forth. Our Academies must justify their name and be\r\ndomestic institutions, permanent lyric organizations, before we can call in\r\nsingers to illustrate an opera, instead of worn-out operas to illustrate\r\nthe singer.\r\n\r\nSince penning the above, we hear of a fortnight's suspension of the Opera\r\nin New York, to allow time for the preparation of the \"Nozzi di Figaro,\"\r\n\"Robert le Diable,\" \"Les Huguenots,\" &c.\r\n\r\nIn close connection with the opera, the brilliant concerts of Vieuxtemps\r\nand Thalberg go on. Probably there is nothing better of the virtuoso kind;\r\nand as they bring in the orchestra sometimes, they give occasionally\r\nsomething classical and great, performed in a masterly manner. Indeed,\r\nall the music of New York seems to revolve now round the Ullman-Thalberg\r\ncentre. They sweep all into their orbit. With the Harmonic Society, they\r\ngive Sunday oratorios, promising \"The Messiah,\" \"Creation,\" \"Elijah,\"\r\nDavid's \"Desert,\" (!) and others.\r\n\r\nWe have not left ourselves room to more than hint at the truest musical\r\npride of New York, her Philharmonic Society, whose orchestra now numbers\r\neighty excellent performers, and whose list of regular subscribers reaches\r\neighteen hundred. They are rehearsing Spohr's symphony, \"Die Weihe der\r\nTöne,\" with Schumann's \"Manfred\" overture, and Beethoven's sublime\r\n\"Leonora,\" for their first concert, and will do much for classical music\r\nby their four concerts. In Boston, in spite of our broken and disorganized\r\ncondition, we have ten or a dozen Symphony concerts in a winter. Chamber\r\nQuartets, too, and Trios with Piano, will have their audiences,--let us\r\nhope numerous enough to gladden the hearts of the artists.",
