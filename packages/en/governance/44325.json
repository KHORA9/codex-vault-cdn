THE GREAT AMERICAN FRAUD.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Oct. 7, 1905. {003}\r\n\r\nThis is the introductory article to a series which will contain a full\r\nexplanation and exposure of patent-medicine methods, and the harm done\r\nto the public by this industry, founded mainly on fraud and poison.\r\nResults of the publicity given to these methods can already be seen\r\nin the steps recently taken by the National Government, some State\r\nGovernments and a few of the more reputable newspapers. The object\r\nof the series is to make the situation so familiar and thoroughly\r\nunderstood that there will be a speedy end to the worst aspects of the\r\nevil.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {003}\r\n\r\nGullible America will spend this year some seventy-five millions of\r\ndollars in the purchase of patent medicines. In consideration of this\r\nsum it will swallow huge quantities of alcohol, an appalling amount of\r\nopiates and narcotics, a wide assortment of varied drugs ranging from\r\npowerful and dangerous heart depressants to insidious liver stimulants;\r\nand, far in excess of all other ingredients, undiluted fraud. For fraud,\r\nexploited by the skillfulest of advertising bunco men, is the basis of\r\nthe trade. Should the newspapers, the magazines and the medical journals\r\nrefuse their pages to this class of advertisements, the patent-medicine\r\nbusiness in five years would be as scandalously historic as the South\r\nSea Bubble, and the nation would be the richer not only in lives and\r\nmoney, but in drunkards and drug-fiends saved.\r\n\r\n\"Don't make the mistake of lumping all proprietary medicines in one\r\nindiscriminate denunciation,\" came warning from all sides when this\r\nseries was announced. But the honest attempt to separate the sheep from\r\nthe goats develops a lamentable lack of qualified candidates for the\r\nsheepfold. External remedies there may be which are at once honest in\r\ntheir claims and effective for their purposes; they are not to be found\r\namong the much-advertised ointments or applications which fill the\r\npublic prints.\r\n\r\nCuticura may be a useful preparation, but in extravagance of advertising\r\nit rivals the most clamorous cure-all. Pond's Extract, one would\r\nnaturally suppose, could afford to restrict itself to decent methods,\r\nbut in the recent {004}epidemic scare in New York it traded on the\r\npublic alarm by putting forth \"display\" advertisements headed, in heavy\r\nblack type, \"Meningitis,\" a disease in which witch-hazel is about as\r\neffective as molasses. This is fairly comparable to Peruna's ghoulish\r\nexploitation, for profit, of the yellow-fever scourge in New Orleans,\r\naided by various southern newspapers of standing, which published as\r\n_news_ an \"interview\" with Dr. Hartman, president of the Peruna Company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs That Make Victims.\r\n\r\nWhen one comes to the internal remedies, the proprietary medicines\r\nproper, they all belong to the tribe of Capricorn, under one of two\r\nheads, harmless frauds or deleterious drugs. For instance, the laxatives\r\nperform what they promise; if taken regularly, as thousands of people\r\ntake them (and, indeed, as the advertisements urge), they become an\r\nincreasingly baneful necessity. Acetanilid will undoubtedly relieve\r\nheadache of certain kinds; but acetanilid, as the basis of headache\r\npowders, is prone to remove the cause of the symptoms permanently by\r\nputting a complete stop to the heart action. Invariably, when taken\r\nsteadily, it produces constitutional disturbances of insidious\r\ndevelopment which result fatally if the drug be not discontinued, and\r\noften it enslaves the devotee to its use. Cocain and opium stop pain;\r\nbut the narcotics are not the safest drugs to put into the hands of the\r\nignorant, particularly when their presence is concealed in the \"cough\r\nremedies,\" \"soothing syrups,\" and \"catarrhal powders\" of which they are\r\nthe basis. Few outside of the rabid temperance advocates will deny a\r\nplace in medical practice to alcohol. But alcohol, fed daily and in\r\nincreasing doses to women and children, makes not for health, but for\r\ndrunkenness. Far better whiskey or gin unequivocally labeled than the\r\nalcohol-laden \"bitters,\" \"sarsaparillas\" and \"tonics\" which exhilerate\r\nfatuous temperance advocates to the point of enthusiastic testimonials.\r\n\r\nNone of these \"cures\" really does cure any serious affection, although\r\na majority of their users recover. But a majority, and a very large\r\nmajority, of the sick recover, anyway. Were it not so--were one illness\r\nout of fifty fatal--this earth would soon be depopulated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Testimonials.\r\n\r\nThe ignorant drug-taker, returning to health from some disease which he\r\nhas overcome by the natural resistant powers of his body, dips his pen\r\nin gratitude and writes his testimonial. The man who dies in spite of\r\nthe patent medicine--or perhaps because of it--doesn't bear witness to\r\nwhat it did for him. We see recorded only the favorable results: the\r\nunfavorable lie silent. How could it be otherwise when the only avenues\r\nof publicity are controlled by the advertisers? So, while many of the\r\nprinted testimonials are genuine enough, they represent not the average\r\nevidence, but the most glowing opinions which the nostrum vender\r\ncan obtain, and generally they are the expression of a low order of\r\nintelligence. Read in this light, they are unconvincing enough. But the\r\ninnocent public regards them as the type, not the exception. \"If that\r\ncured Mrs. Smith of Oshgosh it may cure me,\" says the woman whose\r\nsymptoms, real or imaginary, are so feelingly described under the\r\npicture. Lend ear to expert testimony from a certain prominent cure-all:\r\n\r\n\"They see my advertising. They read the testimonials. They are\r\nconvinced. They have faith in Peruna. It gives them a gentle stimulant\r\nand so they get well.\"\r\n\r\nThere it is in a nutshell; the faith cure. Not the stimulant, but the\r\nfaith inspired by the advertisement and encouraged by the stimulant\r\ndoes the work--or seems to do it. If the public drugger can convince his\r\npatron {005}that she is well, she _is_ well--for his purposes. In the\r\ncase of such diseases as naturally tend to cure themselves, no greater\r\nharm is done than the parting of a fool and his money. With rheumatism,\r\nsciatica and that ilk, it means added pangs; with consumption, Bright's\r\ndisease and other serious disorders, perhaps needless death. No onus of\r\nhomicide is borne by the nostrum seller; probably the patient would have\r\ndied anyway; there is no proof that the patent bottle was in any way\r\nresponsible. Even if there were--and rare cases do occur where the\r\nresponsibility can be brought home--there is no warning to others,\r\nbecause the newspapers are too considerate of their advertisers to\r\npublish such injurious items.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Magic \"Red Clause.\"\r\n\r\nWith a few honorable exceptions the press of the United States is at the\r\nbeck and call of the patent medicines. Not only do the newspapers modify\r\nnews possibly affecting these interests, but they sometimes become their\r\nactive agents. F. J. Cheney, proprietor of Hall's Catarrh Cure, devised\r\nsome years ago a method of making the press do his fighting against\r\nlegislation compelling makers of remedies to publish their formulæ, or\r\nto print on the labels the dangerous drugs contained in the medicine--a\r\nconstantly recurring bugaboo of the nostrum-dealer. This scheme he\r\nunfolded at a meeting of the Proprietary Association of America, of\r\nwhich he is now president. He explained that he printed in red letters\r\non every advertising contract a clause providing that the contract\r\nshould become void in the event of hostile legislation, and he boasted\r\nhow he had used this as a club in a case where an Illinois legislator\r\nhad, as he put it, attempted to hold him for three hundred dollars on a\r\nstrike bill.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I had a better plan than this,\" said Mr. Cheney to his\r\nassociates, \"so I wrote to about forty papers and merely said: 'Please\r\nlook at your contract with me and take note that if this law passes you\r\nand I must stop doing business,' The next week every one of them had an\r\narticle and Mr. Man had to go.\"\r\n\r\nSo emphatically did this device recommend itself to the assemblage that\r\nmany of the large firms took up the plan, and now the \"red clause\" is a\r\nfamiliar device in the trade. The reproduction printed on page 6 {p006}\r\nis a fac-simile of a contract between Mr. Cheney's firm and the Emporia\r\n_Gazette_, William Allen White's paper, which has since become one\r\nof the newspapers to abjure the patent-medicine man and all his ways.\r\nEmboldened by this easy coercion of the press, certain firms have since\r\nused the newspapers as a weapon against \"price-cutting,\" by forcing\r\nthem to refuse advertising of the stores which reduce rates on patent\r\nmedicines. Tyrannical masters, these heavy purchasers of advertising\r\nspace.\r\n\r\nTo what length daily journalism will go at the instance of the business\r\noffice was shown in the great advertising campaign of Paine's Celery\r\nCompound, some years ago. The nostrum's agent called at the office of a\r\nprominent Chicago newspaper and spread before its advertising manager a\r\nfull-page advertisement, with blank spaces in the center.\r\n\r\n\"We want some good, strong testimonials to fill out with,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"You can get all of those you want, can't you?\" asked the newspaper\r\nmanager.\r\n\r\n\"Can _you?_\" returned the other. \"Show me four or five strong ones from\r\nlocal politicians and you get the ad.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFake Testimonials.\r\n\r\nThat day reporters were assigned to secure testimonials with photographs\r\nwhich subsequently appeared in the full-page advertisement as\r\npromised. As for the men who permitted the use of their names for this\r\n{006}purpose, several of them afterward admitted that they had\r\nnever tasted the \"Compound,\" but that they were willing to sign the\r\ntestimonials for the joy of appearing in print as \"prominent citizens.\"\r\nAnother Chicago newspaper compelled its political editor to tout for\r\nfake indorsements of a nostrum. A man with an inside knowledge of the\r\npatent-medicine business made some investigations into this phase of the\r\nmatter, and he declares that such procurement of testimonials became so\r\nestablished as to have the force of a system, only two Chicago papers\r\nbeing free from it.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {006}\r\n\r\nTo-day, he adds, a similar \"deal\" could be made with half a dozen of\r\nthat city's dailies. It is disheartening to note that in the case of\r\none important and high-class daily, the Pittsburg _Gazette_, a trial\r\nrejection of all patent-medicine advertising received absolutely no\r\nsupport or encouragement from the public; so the paper reverted to its\r\nold policy.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {007} A WINDOW EXHIBIT IN A CHICAGO DRUG STORE.\r\n\r\n{008} The control is as complete, though exercised by a class of\r\nnostrums somewhat differently exploited, but essentially the same.\r\nOnly \"ethical\" preparations are permitted in the representative medical\r\npress, that is, articles not advertised in the lay press. Yet this\r\ndistinction is not strictly adhered to. \"Syrup of Figs,\" for instance,\r\nwhich makes widespread pretense in the dailies to be an extract of the\r\nfig, advertises in the medical journals for what it is, a preparation\r\nof senna. Antikamnia, an \"ethical\" proprietary compound, for a long\r\ntime exploited itself to the profession by a campaign of ridiculous\r\nextravagance, and is to-day by the extent of its reckless _use_ on the\r\npart of ignorant laymen a public menace. Recently an article announcing\r\na startling new drug discovery and signed by a physician was offered to\r\na standard medical journal, which declined it on learning that the drug\r\nwas a proprietary preparation. The contribution was returned to the\r\neditor with an offer of payment at advertising rates if it were printed\r\nas editorial reading matter, only to be rejected on the new basis.\r\nSubsequently it appeared simultaneously in more than twenty medical\r\npublications as reading matter. There are to-day very few medical\r\npublications which do not carry advertisements conceived in the same\r\nspirit and making much tin same exhaustive claims as the ordinary quack\r\n\"ads\" of the daily press, and still fewer that are free from promises\r\nto \"cure\" diseases which are incurable by any medicine. Thus the medical\r\npress is as strongly enmeshed by the \"ethical\" druggers as the lay press\r\nis by Paine, \"Dr.\" Kilmer, Lydia Pinkham, Dr. Hartman, \"Hall\" of the\r\n\"red clause\" and the rest of the edifying band of life-savers, leaving\r\nno agency to refute the megaphone exploitation of the fraud. What\r\nopposition there is would naturally arise in the medical profession, but\r\nthis is discounted by the proprietary interests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Doctors Are Investigating.\r\n\r\n\"You attack us because we cure your patients,\" is their charge. They\r\nassume always that the public has no grievance against them, or, rather,\r\nthey calmly ignore the public in the matter. In his address at the last\r\nconvention of the Proprietary Association, the retiring president, W.\r\nA. Talbot of Piso's Consumption Cure, turning his guns on the medical\r\nprofession, delivered this astonishing sentiment:\r\n\r\n\"No argument favoring the publication of our formulas was ever uttered\r\nwhich does not apply with equal force to your prescriptions. It is\r\npardonable in you to want to know these formulas, for they are good.\r\nBut you must not ask us to reveal these valuable secrets, to do what you\r\nwould not do yourselves. The public and our law-makers do not want your\r\nsecrets nor ours, _and it would be a damage to them to have them_.\"\r\n\r\nThe physicians seem to have awakened, somewhat tardily, indeed, to\r\ncounter-attack. The American Medical Association has organized a Council\r\non Pharmacy and Chemistry to investigate and pass on the \"ethical\"\r\npreparations advertised to physicians, with a view to listing those\r\nwhich are found to be reputable and useful. That this is regarded as\r\na direct assault on the proprietary interests is suggested by the\r\nprotests, eloquent to the verge of frenzy in some cases, emanating from\r\nthose organs which the manufacturers control. Already the council has\r\nissued some painfully frank reports on products of imposingly scientific\r\nnomenclature; and more are to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat One Druggist Is Doing.\r\n\r\nLargely for trade reasons a few druggists have been fighting the\r\nnostrums, but without any considerable effect. Indeed, it is surprising\r\nto see that people are so deeply impressed with the advertising claims\r\nput forth daily as to be impervious to warnings even from experts. {009}\r\n\r\nA cut-rate store, the Economical Drug Company of Chicago, started on a\r\ncampaign and displayed a sign in the window reading:\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {009}\r\n\r\nPLEASE DO NOT ASK US\r\n\r\nWhat is ANY OLD PATENT MEDICINE Worth?\r\n\r\nFor you embarrass us, as our honest answer must be that IT IS WORTHLESS\r\n\r\nIf you mean to ask at what price we sell it, that is an entirely\r\ndifferent proposition.\r\n\r\nWhen sick, consult a good physician. It is the only proper course. And\r\nyou will find it cheaper in the end than self-medication with worthless\r\n\"patent\" nostrums.\r\n\r\nThis was followed up by the salesmen informing all applicants for the\r\nprominent nostrums that they were wasting money. Yet with all this that\r\nstore was unable to get rid of its patent-medicine trade, and to-day\r\nnostrums comprise one-third of its entire business. They comprise about\r\ntwo-thirds of that of the average small store.\r\n\r\nLegislation is the most obvious remedy, pending the enlightenment of\r\nthe general public or the awakening of the journalistic conscience. But\r\nlegislation proceeds slowly and always against opposition, which may be\r\nmeasured in practical terms as $250,000,000 at stake on the other\r\nside. I note in the last report of the Proprietary Association's annual\r\nmeeting the significant statement that \"the heaviest expenses were\r\nincurred in legislative work.\" Most of the legislation must be done by\r\nstates, and we have seen in the case of the Hall Catarrh cure contract\r\nhow readily this may be controlled.\r\n\r\nTwo government agencies, at least, lend themselves to the purposes of\r\nthe patent-medicine makers. The Patent Office issues to them trade-mark\r\nregistration (generally speaking, the convenient term \"patent medicine\"\r\nis a misnomer, as very few are patented) without inquiry into the nature\r\nof the article thus safeguarded against imitation. The Post Office\r\nDepartment permits them the use of the mails. Except one particular\r\nline, the disgraceful \"Weak Manhood\" remedies, where excellent work has\r\nbeen done in throwing them out of the mails for fraud, the department\r\nhas done nothing in the matter of patent remedies, and has no present\r\nintention of doing anything; yet I believe that such action, powerful as\r\nwould be {010}the opposition developed, would be upheld by the courts on\r\nthe same grounds that sustained the Post Office's position in the recent\r\ncase of \"Robusto.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Post-Office Report.\r\n\r\nThat the advertising and circular statements circulated through the\r\nmails were materially and substantially false, with the result of\r\ncheating and defrauding those into whose hands the statements came;\r\n\r\nThat, while the remedies did possess medicinal properties, these were\r\nnot such as to carry out the cures promised;\r\n\r\nThat the advertiser knew he was deceiving;\r\n\r\nThat in the sale and distribution of his medicines the complainant made\r\nno inquiry into the specific character of the disease in any individual\r\ncase, but supplied the same remedies and prescribed the same mode of\r\ntreatment to all alike.\r\n\r\nShould the department apply these principles to the patent-medicine\r\nfield generally, a number of conspicuous nostrums would cease to be\r\npat-, rons of Uncle Sam's mail service.\r\n\r\nSome states have made a good start in the matter of legislation, among\r\nthem Michigan, which does not, however, enforce its recent strong law.\r\nMassachusetts, which has done more, through the admirable work of its\r\nState Board of Health, than any other agency to educate the public on\r\nthe patent-medicine question, is unable to get a law restricting this\r\ntrade. In New Hampshire, too, the proprietary interests have proven\r\ntoo strong, and the Mallonee bill was destroyed by the almost\r\nunited opposition of a \"red-clause\" press. North Dakota proved more\r\nindependent. After Jan. 1, 1906, all medicines sold in that state,\r\nexcept on physicians' prescriptions, which contain chloral, ergot,\r\nmorphin, opium, cocain, bromin, iodin or any of their compounds or\r\nderivatives, or more than 5 per cent, of alcohol, must so state on\r\nthe label. When this bill became a law, the Proprietary Association\r\nof America proceeded to blight the state by resolving that its members\r\nshould offer no goods for sale there.\r\n\r\nBoards of health in various parts of the country are doing valuable\r\neducational work, the North Dakota board having led in the legislation.\r\nThe Massachusetts, Connecticut and North Carolina boards have been\r\nactive. The New York State board has kept its hands off patent\r\nmedicines, but the Board of Pharmacy has made a cautious but promising\r\nbeginning by compelling all makers of powders containing cocain to put\r\na poison label on their goods; and it proposes to extend this ruling\r\ngradually to other dangerous compositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth Boards and Analyses.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat surprising to find the Health Department of New York\r\nCity, in many respects the foremost in the country, making no use of\r\ncarefully and rather expensively acquired knowledge which would serve\r\nto protect the public. More than two years ago analyses were made by the\r\nchemists of the department which showed dangerous quantities of cocain\r\nin a number of catarrh powders. These analyses have never been printed.\r\nEven the general nature of the information has been withheld. Should\r\nany citizen of New York, going to the Health Department, have asked:\r\n\"My wife is taking Birney's Catarrh Powder; is it true that it's a\r\nbad thing?\" the officials, with the knowledge at hand that the drug in\r\nquestion is a mater of cocain fiends, would have blandly emulated the\r\nSphinx. Outside criticism of an overworked, undermanned and generally\r\nefficient department is liable to error through ignorance of the\r\nproblems involved in its administration; yet one can not but believe\r\nthat some form of warning against what is wisely admittedly a public\r\nmenace would have been a wiser form {011}of procedure than that\r\nwhich has heretofore been discovered by the formula, \"policy of the\r\ndepartment.\"\r\n\r\nPolicies change and broaden under pressure of conditions. The Health\r\nCommissioner is now formulating a plan which, with the work of the\r\nchemists as a basis, shall check the trade in public poisons more or\r\nless concealed behind proprietary names.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, even in a series of articles, to attempt more than an\r\nexemplary treatment of the patent-medicine frauds. The most degraded\r\nand degrading, the \"lost vitality\" and \"blood disease\" cures, reeking of\r\nterrorization and blackmail, can not from their very nature be treated\r\nof in a lay journal. Many dangerous and health-destroying compounds will\r\nescape through sheer inconspicuousness. I can touch on only a few of\r\nthose which may be regarded as typical: the alcohol stimulators, as\r\nrepresented by Peruna, Paine's Celery Compound and Duffy's Pure Malt\r\nWhiskey (advertised as an exclusively medical preparation); the catarrh\r\npowders, which breed cocain slaves, and the opium-containing soothing\r\nsyrups, which stunt or kill helpless infants; the consumption cures,\r\nperhaps the most devilish of all, in that they destroy hope where hope\r\nis struggling against bitter odds for existence; the headache powders,\r\nwhich enslave so insidiously that the victim is ignorant of his own\r\nfate; the comparatively harmless fake as typified by that marvelous\r\nproduct of advertising and effrontery, Liquozone; and, finally, the\r\nsystem of exploitation and testimonials on which the whole vast system\r\nof bunco rests, as on a flimsy but cunningly constructed foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. PERUNA AND THE BRACERS.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Oct. 28, 1905. {012}\r\n\r\nA distinguished public health official and medical writer once made this\r\njocular suggestion to me:\r\n\r\n\"Let us buy in large quantities the cheapest Italian vermouth, poor gin\r\nand bitters. We will mix them in the proportion of three of vermouth to\r\ntwo of gin, with a dash of bitters, dilute and bottle them by the\r\nshort quart, label them '_Smith's Reviver ana Blood Purifier; dose,\r\none wineglassful before each meal_'; advertise them to cure erysipelas,\r\nbunions, dyspepsia, heat rash, fever and ague, and consumption; and to\r\nprevent loss of hair, smallpox, old age, sunstroke and near-sightedness,\r\nand make our everlasting fortunes selling them to the temperance trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds to me very much like a cocktail,\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"So it is,\" he replied. \"But it's just as much a medicine as Peruna and\r\nnot as bad a drink.\"\r\n\r\nPeruna, or, as its owner, Dr. S. B. Hartman, of Columbus, Ohio (once\r\na physician in good standing), prefers to write it, Pe-ru-na, is at\r\npresent the most prominent proprietary nostrum in the country. It has\r\ntaken the place once held by Greene's Nervura and by Paine's Celery\r\nCompound, and for the same reason which made them popular. The name of\r\nthat reason is alcohol.* Peruna is a stimulant pure and simple, and\r\nit is the more dangerous in that it sails under the false colors of a\r\nbenign purpose.\r\n\r\n     * Dr. Ashbel P. Grinnell of New York City, who has made a\r\n     statistical study of patent medicines, asserts as a provable\r\n     fact that more alcohol is consumed in this country in patent\r\n     medicines than is dispensed in a legal way by licensed\r\n     liquor venders, barring the sale of ales and beer.\r\n\r\nAccording to an authoritative statement given out in private circulation\r\na few years ago by its proprietors, Peruna is a compound of seven\r\ndrugs with cologne spirits. This formula, they assure me, has not been\r\nmaterially changed. None of the seven drugs is of any great potency.\r\nTheir total is less than one-half of 1 per cent, of the product.\r\nMedicinally they are too inconsiderable, in this proportion, to produce\r\nany effect. There remains to Peruna only water and cologne spirits,\r\nroughly in the proportion of three to one. Cologne spirits is the\r\ncommercial term for alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Peruna Is Made Of.\r\n\r\nAny one wishing to make Peruna for home consumption may do so by mixing\r\nhalf a pint of cologne spirits, 190 proof, with a pint and a half of\r\nwater, adding thereto a little cubebs for flavor and a little burned\r\nsugar for color. Manufactured in bulk, so a former Peruna agent\r\nestimates, its cost, including bottle and wrapper, is between fifteen\r\nand eighteen cents a bottle. Its price is $1.00. Because of this\r\nhandsome margin of profit, and by way of making hay in the stolen\r\nsunshine of Peruna advertising, many imitations have sprung up to harass\r\nthe proprietors of the alcohol-and-water product. Pe-ru-vi-na, P-ru-na,\r\nPurina, Anurep (an obvious inversion); these, bottled and labeled to\r\nresemble Peruna, are self-confessed imitations. From what the Peruna\r\npeople tell me, I gather that they are dangerous and damnable frauds,\r\nand that they cure nothing.\r\n\r\nWhat does Peruna cure? Catarrh. That is the modest claim for it; nothing\r\nbut catarrh. To be sure, a careful study of its literature will suggest\r\nits value as a tonic and a preventive of lassitude. But its reputation\r\n{013}rests on catarrh. What is catarrh? Whatever ails you. No matter\r\nwhat you've got, you will be not only enabled, but compelled, after\r\nreading Dr. Hartman's Peruna book, \"The Ills of Life,\" to diagnose\r\nyour illness as catarrh and to realize that Peruna alone will save\r\nyou. Pneumonia is catarrh of the lungs; so is consumption. Dyspepsia\r\nis catarrh of the stomach. Enteritis is catarrh of the intestines.\r\nAppendicitis--surgeons, please note before operating--is catarrh of the\r\nappendix. Bright's disease is catarrh of the kidneys. Heart disease is\r\ncatarrh of the heart. Canker sores are catarrh of the mouth. Measles\r\nis, perhaps, catarrh of the skin, since \"a teaspoonful of Peruna thrice\r\ndaily or oftener is an effectual cure\" (\"The Ills of Life\"). Similarly,\r\nmalaria, one may guess, is catarrh of the mosquito that bit you. Other\r\ndiseases not specifically placed in the catarrhal class, but yielding to\r\nPeruna (in the book), are colic, mumps, convulsions, neuralgia, women's\r\ncomplaints and rheumatism. Yet \"Peruna is not a cure-all,\" virtuously\r\ndisclaims Dr. Hartman, and grasps at a golden opportunity by advertising\r\nhis nostrum as a preventive against yellow fever! That alcohol and\r\nwater, with a little coloring matter and one-half of 1 per cent, of mild\r\ndrugs, will cure all or any of the ills listed above is too ridiculous\r\nto need refutation. Nor does Dr. Hartman himself personally make that\r\nclaim for his product. He stated to me specifically and repeatedly that\r\nno drug or combination of drugs, with the possible exception of quinin\r\nfor malaria, will cure disease. His claim is that the belief of the\r\npatient in Peruna, fostered as it is by the printed testimony, and\r\naided by the \"gentle stimulation,\" produces good results. It is well\r\nestablished that in certain classes of disease the opposite is true.\r\nA considerable proportion of tuberculosis cases show a history of the\r\nPeruna type of medicines taken in the early stages, with the result of\r\ndiminishing the patient's resistant power, and much of the typhoid in\r\nthe middle west is complicated by the victim's \"keeping up\" on this\r\nstimulus long after he should have been under a doctor's care. But it\r\nis not as a fraud on the sick alone that Peruna is baneful, but as the\r\nmaker of drunkards also.\r\n\r\n\"It can be used any length of time without acquiring a drug habit,\"\r\ndeclares the Peruna book, and therein, I regret to say, lies\r\nspecifically and directly. The lie is ingeniously backed up by Dr.\r\nHartman's argument that \"nobody could get drunk on the prescribed doses\r\nof Peruna.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps this is true, though I note three wineglassfuls in\r\nforty-five minutes as a prescription which might temporarily alter a\r\nprohibitionist's outlook on life. But what makes Peruna profitable to\r\nthe maker and a curse to the community at large is the fact that the\r\nminimum dose first ceases to satisfy, then the moderate dose, and\r\nfinally the maximum dose; and the unsuspecting patron, who began with\r\nit as a medicine, goes on to use it as a beverage and finally to be\r\nenslaved by it as a habit. A well-known authority on drug addictions\r\nwrites me:\r\n\r\n\"A number of physicians have called my attention to the use of Peruna,\r\nboth preceding and following alcohol and drug addictions. Lydia\r\nPinkham's Compound is another dangerous drug used largely by drinkers;\r\nPaine's Celery Compound also. I have in the last two years met four\r\ncases of persons who drank Peruna in large quantities to intoxication.\r\nThis was given to them originally as a tonic. They were treated under my\r\ncare as simple alcoholics.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Government Forbids the Sale of Peruna to Indians.\r\n\r\nExpert opinion on the non-medical side is represented in the government\r\norder to the Indian Department, reproduced on the following page, the\r\nkernel of which is this: {014}\r\n\r\nDEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR,\r\n\r\nOFFICE OF INDIAN AFFAIRS,\r\n\r\nWashington, D. C., _August 10, 1905._\r\n\r\n_To Indian Agents and School Superintendents in charge of Agencies:_\r\n\r\nThe attention of the Office has been called to the fact that many\r\nlicensed traders are very negligent as to the way in which their stores\r\nare kept. Some lack of order might he condoned, but it is reported that\r\nmany stores are dirty even to filthiness. Such a condition of affairs\r\nneed not be tolerated, and improvement in that respect must be insisted\r\non.\r\n\r\nThe Office is not so inexperienced as to suppose that traders open\r\nstores among Indians from philanthropic motive's. Nevertheless a trader\r\nhas a great influence among the Indians with whom he has constant\r\ndealings and who are often dependent upon him, and there are not a few\r\ninstances in which the trader has exerted this influence for the welfare\r\nof his customers as well as for his own profit.\r\n\r\nA well-kept store, tidy in appearance, where the goods, especially\r\neatables, are handled in a cleanly way, with due regard to ordinary\r\nhygiene, and where exact business methods prevail is a civilizing\r\ninfluence among Indians, while disorder, slovenliness, slipshod ways,\r\nand dirt are demoralizing.\r\n\r\nYou will please examine into the way in which the traders under your\r\nsupervision conduct their stores, how their goods, particularly edible\r\ngoods, are handled, stored, and given out, and see to it that in these\r\nrespects, as well in respect of weights, prices, and account-keep-ing,\r\nthe business is properly conducted. If any trader, after due notice,\r\nfails to come up to these requirements you will report him to this\r\nOffice.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this investigation, please give particular attention\r\n{016}to the proprietary medicines and other compounds which the traders\r\nkeep in stock, with special reference to the liability of their misuse\r\nby Indians on account of the alcohol which they contain. The sale of\r\nPeruna, which is on the lists of several traders, is hereby absolutely\r\nprohibited. As a medicine, something else can be substituted; as an\r\nintoxicant, it has been found too tempting and effective. Anything of\r\nthe sort under another name which is found to lead to intoxication you\r\nwill please report to this Office. When a compound of that sort gets a\r\nbad name it is liable to be put on the market with some slight change of\r\nform and a new name. Jamaica ginger and flavoring extracts of vanilla,\r\nlemon, and so forth, should be kept in only small quantities and in\r\nsmall bottles and should not be sold to Indians, or at least only\r\nsparingly to those who it is known will use them only for legitimate\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nOf course, you will continue to give attention to the labeling of\r\npoisonous drugs with skull and cross-bones as per Office circular of\r\nJanuary 12, 1905.\r\n\r\nCopies of this circular letter are herewith to be furnished the traders.\r\n\r\nYours, respectfully,\r\n\r\nC. F. LARRABEE,\r\n\r\n_Acting Commissioner._\r\n\r\n\r\nNote, in the fifth paragraph, these sentences: \"The sale of Peruna which\r\nis on the list of several traders, _is hereby absolutely prohibited._\r\nAs a medicine something else can be substituted; as an Intoxicant it has\r\nbeen found too tempting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlcohol In \"Medicines\" And In Liquors.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {015}\r\n\r\nThese diagrams show what would be left in a bottle of patent medicine\r\nIf everything was poured out except the alcohol; they also show the\r\nquantity of alcohol that would be present if the same bottle had\r\ncontained whisky, champagne, claret or beer. It is apparent that a\r\nbottle of Peruna contains as much alcohol as five bottles of beer, or\r\nthree bottles of claret or champagne--that is, bottles of the same size.\r\nIt would take nearly nine bottles of beer to put as much alcohol into\r\na thirsty man's system as a temperance advocate can get by drinking one\r\nbottle of Hostetter's Stomach Bitters. While the \"doses\" prescribed\r\nby the patent medicine manufacturers are only one to two teaspoonfuls\r\nseveral times a day, the opportunity to take more exists, and even small\r\ndoses of alcohol, taken regularly, cause that craving which is the first\r\nstep in the making of a drunkard or drag fiend.\r\n\r\nSpecific evidence of what Peruna can do will be found in the following\r\nreport, verified by special investigation:\r\n\r\nPinedale, Wyo., Oct. 4.-- (Special.)--\"Two men suffering from delirium\r\ntremens and one dead is the result of a Peruna intoxication which took\r\nplace here a few days ago. C. E. Armstrong, of this place, and a\r\nparty of three others started out on a camping trip to the Yellowstone\r\ncountry, taking with them several bottles of whisky and ten bottles of\r\nPeruna, which one of the members of the party was taking as a tonic. The\r\ntrip lasted over a week. The whisky was exhausted and for two days\r\nthe party was without liquor. At last some one suggested that they use\r\nPeruna, of which nine bottles remained. Before they stopped the whole\r\nremaining supply had been consumed and the four men were in a state of\r\nintoxication, the like of which they had never known before. Finally,\r\none awoke with terrible cramps in his stomach and found his companions\r\nseemingly in an almost lifeless condition. Suffering terrible agony,\r\nhe crawled on his hands and knees to a ranch over a mile distant, the\r\nprocess taking him half a day. Aid was sent to his three companions.\r\nArmstrong was dead when the rescue party arrived. The other two men,\r\nstill unconscious, were brought to town in a wagon and are still in a\r\nweak and emaciated condition. Armstrong's body was almost tied in a knot\r\nand could not be straightened for burial.\"\r\n\r\nHere is testimony from a druggist in a Southern \"no license\" town:\r\n\r\n\"Peruna is bought by all the druggists in this section by the gross. I\r\nhave seen persons thoroughly intoxicated from taking Peruna. The common\r\nremark in this place when a drunken party is particularly obstreperous\r\nis that he is on a 'Peruna drunk,' It is a notorious fact that a great\r\nmany do use Peruna to get the alcoholic effect, and they certainly do\r\nget it good and strong. Now, there are other so-called remedies used for\r\nthe same purpose, namely, Gensenica, Kidney Specific, Jamaica Ginger,\r\nHostetter's Bitters, etc.\"\r\n\r\nSo well recognized is this use of the nostrum that a number of the\r\nSouthern newspapers advertise a cure for the \"Teruna habit.\" which\r\nis probably worse than the habit, as is usually the case with these\r\n\"cures.\" In southern Ohio and in the mountain districts of West Virginia\r\nthe \"Peruna jag\" is a standard form of intoxication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo Testimonials.\r\n\r\nA testimonial-hunter in the employ of the Peruna company was referred\r\nby a Minnesota druggist to a prosperous farmer in the neighborhood. The\r\nfarmer gave Peruna a most enthusiastic \"send-off\"; he had been using\r\nit for several months and could say, etc. Then he took the agent to his\r\nbarn and showed him a heap of empty Peruna bottles. The agent counted\r\nthem. There were seventy-four. The druggist added his testimonial. \"That\r\nold boy has a 'still' on all the time since he discovered Peruna,\" said\r\nhe. \"He's my star customer.\" The druggist's testimonial was not printed.\r\n\r\nAt the time when certain Chicago drug stores were fighting some of the\r\nleading patent medicines, and carrying only a small stock of them, a\r\nboy {017}called one evening at one of the downtown shops for thirty-nine\r\nbottles of Peruna. \"There's the money,\" he said. \"The old man wants to\r\nget his before it's all gone.\" Investigation showed that the purchaser\r\nwas the night engineer of a big downtown building and that the entire\r\nworking staff had \"chipped in\" to get a supply of their favorite\r\nstimulant.\r\n\r\n\"But why should any one who wants to get drunk drink Peruna when he can\r\nget whisky?\" argues the nostrum-maker.\r\n\r\nThere are two reasons, one of which is that in many places the\r\n\"medicine\" can be obtained and the liquor can not. Maine, for instance,\r\nbeing a prohibition state, does a big business in patent medicines. So\r\ndoes Kansas. So do most of the no-license counties in the South, though\r\na few have recently thrown out the disguised \"boozes.\" Indiana Territory\r\nand Oklahoma, as we have seen, have done so because of Poor Lo's\r\npredilection toward curing himself of depression with these remedies,\r\nand for a time, at least, Peruna was shipped in in unlabeled boxes.\r\n\r\nUnited States District Attorney Mellette, of the western district of\r\nIndian Territory, writes: \"Vast quantities of Peruna are shipped into\r\nthis country, and I have caused a number of persons to be indicted for\r\nselling the same, and a few of them have been convicted or have entered\r\npleas of guilty. I could give you hundreds of specific cases of 'Peruna\r\ndrunk' among the Indians. It is a common beverage among them, used for\r\nthe purposes of intoxication.\"\r\n\r\nThe other reason why Peruna or some other of its class is often the\r\nagency of drunkenness instead of whisky is that the drinker of Peruna\r\ndoesn't want to get drunk, at least she doesn't know that she wants to\r\nget drunk. I use the feminine pronoun advisedly, because the remedies\r\nof this class are largely supported by women. Lydia Pinkham's variety of\r\ndrink depends for its popularity chiefly on its alcohol. Paine's Celery\r\nCompound relieves depression and lack of vitality on the same principle\r\nthat a cocktail does, and with the same necessity for repetition. I\r\nknow an estimable lady from the middle West who visited her dissipated\r\nbrother in New York--dissipated from her point of view, because she was\r\na pillar of the W. C. T. U., and he frequently took a cocktail before\r\ndinner and came back with it on his breath, whereon she would weep over\r\nhim as one lost to hope. One day, in a mood of brutal exasperation, when\r\nhe hadn't had his drink and was able to discern the flavor of her grief,\r\nhe turned on her:\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what's the matter with you,\" he said. \"You're\r\ndrunk--maudlin drunk!\"\r\n\r\nShe promptly and properly went into hysterics. The physician who\r\nattended diagnosed the case more politely, but to the same effect,\r\nand ascertained that she had consumed something like half a bottle of\r\nKilmer's Swamp-Root that afternoon. Now, Swamp-Root is a very creditable\r\n\"booze,\" but much weaker in alcohol than most of its class. The\r\nbrother was greatly amused until he discovered, to his alarm, that his\r\ndrink-abhorring sister couldn't get along without her patent medicine\r\nbottle! She was in a fair way, quite innocently, of becoming a drunkard.\r\n\r\nAnother example of this \"unconscious drunkenness\" is recorded by the\r\n_Journal of the American Medical Association_: \"A respected clergyman\r\nfell ill and the family physician was called. After examining the\r\npatient carefully the doctor asked for a private interview with the\r\npatient's adult son.\r\n\r\n\"'I am sorry to tell you that your father undoubtedly is suffering from\r\nchronic alcoholism,' said the physician.\r\n\r\n\"'Chronic alcoholism! Why, that's ridiculous! Father never drank a\r\ndrop of liquor in his life, and we know all there is to know about his\r\nhabits.'\r\n\r\n\"'Well, my boy, its chronic alcoholism, nevertheless, and at this\r\npresent {018}moment your father is drunk. How has his health been\r\nrecently? Has he been taking any medicine?'\r\n\r\n\"'Why, for some time, six months, I should say, father has often\r\ncomplained of feeling unusually tired. A few months ago a friend of\r\nhis recommended Peruna to him, assuring him that it would build him up.\r\nSince then he has taken many bottles of it, and I am quite sure that he\r\nhas taken nothing else.'\"\r\n\r\nFrom its very name one would naturally absolve Duffy's Malt Whiskey\r\nfrom fraudulent pretence. But Duffy's Malt Whiskey is a fraud, for\r\nit pretends to be a medicine and to cure all kinds of lung and\r\nthroat diseases. It is especially favored by temperance folk. \"A\r\ndessertspoonful four to six times a day in water and a tablespoonful on\r\ngoing to bed\" (personal prescription for consumptive), makes a fair grog\r\nallowance for an abstainer.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {018}\r\n\r\nA SALOON WINDOW DISPLAY AT AUBURN. N. Y.\r\n\r\nThis bar-room advertises Duffy's Malt Whiskey, the beverage \"indorsed\"\r\nby the \"distinguished divines and temperance workers\" pictured below,\r\nand displays it with other well-known brands of Bourbon and rye--not\r\nas a medicine, but purely as a liquor, to be served, like others, in\r\n15-cent drinks across the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicine or Liquor?\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {019}\r\n\r\nTHREE \"DISTINGUISHED TEMPERANCE WORKERS\" WHO ADVOCATE THE USE OF\r\nWHISKEY.\r\n\r\nOf these three \"distinguished divines and temperance workers,\" the Rev.\r\nDunham runs a Get-Married-Quick Matrimonial Bureau, while the \"Rev.\"\r\nHoughton derives his income from his salary as Deputy Internal Revenue\r\nCollector, his business being to collect Uncle Sam's liquor tax. The\r\nprinted portrait of Houghton is entirely Imaginary; a genuine photograph\r\nof the \"temperance worker\" and whiskey Indorser is shown above. The\r\nRev. McLeod lives in Greenleaf, Mich.--a township of 893 inhabitants, in\r\nSalina County, north of Port Huron, and off the railway line. Mr. McLeod\r\nwas called to trial by his presbytery for Indorsing Duffy's whiskey and\r\nwas allowed to \"resign\" from the fellowship. {020}It has testimonials\r\nranging from consumption to malaria, and indorsements of the clergy.\r\nOn the opposite page we reproduce a Duffy advertisement showing the\r\n\"portraits\" of three \"clergymen\" who consider Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey\r\na gift of God, and on page 18 [IMAGE ==>] {018}a saloon-window display\r\nof this product. For the whisky has its recognized place behind the bar,\r\nbeing sold by the manufacturers to the wholesale liquor trade and by\r\nthem to the saloons, where it may be purchased over the counter for\r\n85 cents a quart. This is cheap, but Duffy's Pure Malt Whiskey, is not\r\nregarded as a high-class article.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {020}\r\n\r\nREV. W. N. DUNHAM.\r\n\r\nBorn in Vermont eighty-two years ago, Mr. Dunham was graduated from the\r\nBoston Medical College and practiced medicine until about thirty years\r\nago, when he moved west. There he became a preacher. He occupied the\r\npulpit of the South Cheyenne, Wyoming, Congregational Church for ten\r\nyears. Two years ago he retired from the pulpit and established a\r\nmarriage bureau for the accommodation of couples who come over from\r\nColorado to be married. No money was paid by the Duffy's Malt Whiskey\r\npeople for Dunham's testimonial; but he received about $10 \"to have his\r\npicture taken.\"\r\n\r\n\"REV.\" M. N. HOUGHTON.\r\n\r\nThis Is the actual likeness of the \"distinguished divine\" with the side\r\nwhiskers in the Duffy whiskey advertisement. Mr. Houghton was for a\r\nnumber of years pastor of the Church of Eternal Hope, of Bradford, Pa.\r\nHe retired six years ago to enter politics, and is now a deputy Internal\r\nRevenue collector. Although a member of the Universalist Church, Mr.\r\nHoughton is a spiritualist and delivered orations last summer at the\r\nLily Dale assembly, the spiritualistic \"City of Light\" located near\r\nDunkirk, N. Y. Mr. Houghton owned racehorses and was a patron of the\r\nturf.\r\n\r\nIts status has been definitely settled in New York State, where Excise\r\nCommissioner Cullinane recently obtained a decision in the supreme court\r\ndeclaring it a liquor. The trial was in Rochester, where the nostrum is\r\nmade. Eleven supposedly reputable physicians, four of them members of\r\nthe Health Department, swore to their belief that the whisky contained\r\ndrugs which constituted it a genuine medicine. The state was able to\r\nshow conclusively that if remedial drugs were present they were in\r\nsuch small {021}quantities as to be indistinguishable, and, of course,\r\nutterly without value; in short, that the product was nothing more or\r\nless than sweetened whisky. Yet the United States government has long\r\nlent its sanction to the \"medicine\" status by exempting Duffy's Pure\r\nMalt Whiskey from the federal liquor tax. In fact, the government is\r\nprimarily responsible for the formal establishment of the product as a\r\nmedicine, having forced it into the patent medicine ranks at the time\r\nwhen the Spanish war expenses were partly raised by a special tax on\r\nnostrums. Up to that time the Duffy product, while asserting its virtues\r\nin various ills, made no direct pretence to be anything but a whisky.\r\nTransfer to the patent medicine list cost it, in war taxes, more\r\nthan $40,000. By way of setting a _quid pro quo_, the company began\r\ningeniously and with some justification to exploit its liquor as \"the\r\nonly whisky recognised by the government as medicine,\" and continues\r\nso to advertise, although the recent decision of the Internal Revenue\r\nDepartment, providing that all patent medicines which have no medicinal\r\nproperties other than the alcohol in them must pay a rectifier's tax,\r\nrelegates it to its proper place. While this decision is not a severe\r\nfinancial blow to the Duffys and their congeners (it means only a few\r\nhundred dollars apiece), it is important as officially establishing\r\nthe \"bracer\" class on the same footing with whisky and gin, where they\r\nbelong. Other \"drugs\" there are which sell largely, perhaps chiefly,\r\nover the oar, Hostetter's Bitters and Damiana Bitters being prominent in\r\nthis class.\r\n\r\nWhen this series of articles was first projected, _Collier's_ received\r\na warning from \"Warner's Safe Cure,\" advising that a thorough\r\ninvestigation would be wise before \"making any attack\" on that\r\npreparation. I have no intention of \"attacking\" this company or any one\r\nelse, and they would have escaped notice altogether, because of their\r\npresent unimportance, but for their letter. The suggested investigation\r\nwas not so thorough as to go deeply into the nature of the remedy, which\r\nis an alcoholic liquid, but it developed this interesting fact; Warner's\r\nSafe Cure, together with all the Warner remedies, is leased, managed\r\nand controlled by the New York and Kentucky Distilling Company,\r\nmanufacturers of standard whiskies which do not pretend to remedy\r\nanything but thirst. Duffy's Malt Whiskey is an another subsidiary\r\ncompany of the New York and Kentucky concern. This statement is\r\nrespectfully submitted to temperance users of the Malt Whiskey and the\r\nWarner remedies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Alcohol Percentages.\r\n\r\nHostetter's Bitters contain, according to an official state analysis,\r\n44 per cent, of alcohol; Lydia Pinkham appeals to suffering womanhood with\r\n20 per cent, of alcohol; Hood's Sarsaparilla cures \"that tired feeling\"\r\nwith 18 per cent.; Burdock's Blood Bitters, with 25 per cent.; Ayer's\r\nSarsaparilla, with 26 per cent., and Paine's Celery Compound, with\r\n21 per cent. The fact is that any of these remedies could be interchanged\r\nwith Peruna or with each other, so far as general effect goes, though\r\nthe iodid of potassium in the sarsaparilla class might have some effect\r\n(as likely to be harmful as helpful ) which would be lacking in the\r\nsimpler mixtures.\r\n\r\nIf this class of nostrum is so harmful, asks the attentive reader of\r\nnewspaper advertising columns, how explain the indorsements of so many\r\npeople of prominence and reputation? \"Men of prominence and reputation\"\r\nin this connection means Peruna, for Peruna has made a specialty of high\r\ngovernment officials and people in the public eye. In a self-gratulatory\r\ndissertation the Peruna Company observes in substance that, while the\r\nleading minds of the nation have hitherto shrunk from the publicity\r\nattendant on commending any patent medicine, the transcendent virtues of\r\nPeruna have overcome this amiable modesty, and, one and all, they stand\r\nforth its avowed champions. This is followed by an ingenious document\r\nheaded {022}\"Fifty Members of Congress Send Letters of Indorsement\r\nto the Inventor of the Great Catarrh Remedy, Pe-ru-na,\" and quoting\r\nthirty-six of the letters. Analysis of these letters brings out the\r\nsingular circumstance that in twenty-one of the thirty-six there is no\r\nindication that the writer has ever tasted the remedy which he so\r\nwarmly praises. As a sample, and for the benefit of lovers of ingenious\r\nliterature, I reprint the following from a humorous member of Congress:\r\n\r\n\"My secretary has as bad a case of catarrh as I ever saw, and since he\r\nhas taken one bottle of Peruna he seems like a different man.\r\n\r\n\"Taylorsville, N. C. Romulus Z. Linney.\"\r\n\r\nThe famous letter of Admiral Schley is a case in point. He wrote to the\r\nPeruna Company:\r\n\r\n\"I can cheerfully say that Mrs. Schley has used Peruna, and, I believe,\r\nwith good effect. [Signed] W. S. Schley.\"\r\n\r\nThis indorsement went the rounds of the country in half-page blazonry,\r\nto the consternation of the family's friends. Admiral Schley seems\r\nto have appreciated that this use of his name was detrimental to his\r\nstanding. He wrote to a Columbus religious journal the following letter:\r\n\r\n\"1820 I Street, Washington, D. C., Nov. 10,1904. \"_Editor Catholic\r\nColumbian_:--The advertisement of the Peruna Company, inclosed, is made\r\nwithout any authority or approval from me. When it was brought to\r\nmy attention first I wrote the company a letter, stating that\r\nthe advertisement was offensive and must be discontinued. Their\r\nrepresentative here called on me and stated he had been directed to\r\nassure me no further publication would be allowed, as it was without my\r\nsanction.\r\n\r\n\"I would say that the advertisement has been made without my knowledge\r\nor consent and is an infringement of my rights as a citizen.\r\n\r\n\"If you will kindly inform me what the name and date of the paper was in\r\nwhich the inclosed advertisement appeared I shall feel obliged.\r\n\r\n\"Very truly yours, W. S. Schley.\"\r\n\r\nCareful study of this document will show that this is no explicit denial\r\nof the testimonial. But who gives careful study to such a letter? On the\r\nface of it, it puts the Peruna people in the position of having forged\r\ntheir advertisement. Ninety-nine people out of a hundred would get\r\nthat impression. Yet I have seen the testimonial, signed with Admiral\r\nSchley's name and interlined in the same handwriting as the signature,\r\nand I have seen another letter, similarly signed, stating that Admiral\r\nSchley had not understood that the letter was to be used for such\r\nadvertising as the recipient based on it. If these letters are forgeries\r\nthe victim has his recourse in the law. They are on file at Columbus,\r\nOhio, and the Peruna Company would doubtless produce them in defense of\r\na suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the Government Can Do.\r\n\r\nOne thing that the public has a right to demand in its attitude toward\r\nthe proprietary medicines containing alcohol: that the government carry\r\nout rigidly its promised policy no longer to permit liquors to disguise\r\nthemselves as patent medicines, and thereby escape the tax which is put\r\non other (and probably better) brands of intoxicants. One other demand\r\nit should make on the purveyors of the concoctions: that they label\r\nevery bottle with the percentage of alcohol it contains; that they label\r\nevery man who writes testimonials to Duffy, and the W. C. T. U. member\r\nwho indorses Peruna, Lydia Pinkham, Warner and their compeers, will\r\nknow when they imbibe their \"tonics,\" \"invigorators,\" \"swamp roots,\"\r\n\"bitters,\" \"nerve-builders\" or \"spring medicines\" that they are sipping\r\nby the tablespoon or wineglassful what the town tippler takes across the\r\nlicense-paying bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--LIQUOZONE.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Nov. 18, 1905. {023}\r\n\r\nTwenty years ago the microbe was making a great stir in the land. The\r\npublic mind, ever prone to exaggerate the importance and extent of any\r\nnew scientific discovery, ascribed all known diseases to microbes. The\r\ninfinitesimal creature with the mysterious and unpleasant attributes\r\nbecame the leading topic of the time. Shrewdly appreciating this golden\r\nopportunity, a quack genius named Radam invented a drug to slay the new\r\nenemy of mankind and gave it his name. Radam's Microbe Killer filled the\r\npublic prints with blazonry of its lethal virtues. As it consisted of a\r\nmixture of muriatic and sulphuric acids with red wine, any microbe which\r\ntook it was like to fare hard; but the ingenious Mr. Radam's method of\r\nadministering it to its intended prey via the human stomach failed to\r\ncommend itself to science, though enormously successful in a financial\r\nsense through flamboyant advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquozone \"Cures\" Thirty-seven Varieties.\r\n\r\nIn time some predaceous bacillus, having eluded the \"killer,\" carried\r\noff its inventor. His nostrum soon languished. To-day it is little heard\r\nof, but from the ashes of its glories has risen a mightier successor,\r\nLiquozone. Where twenty years ago the microbe reveled in publicity,\r\nto-day we talk of germs and bacteria; consequently Liquozone exploits\r\nitself as a germicide and bactericide. It dispenses with the red wine\r\nof the Radam concoction and relies on a weak solution of sulphuric\r\nand sulphurous acids, with an occasional trace of hydrochloric or\r\nhydrobromic acid. Mostly it is water, and this is what it \"cures\":\r\n\r\n     \"Asthma, Gallstones,\r\n     Abscess--Anemia, Goiter--Gout;\r\n     Bronchitis, Hay Fever--Influenza,\r\n     Blood Poison, La Grippe,\r\n     Bowel Troubles, Leucorrhea,\r\n     Coughs--Colds, Malaria--Neuralgia,\r\n     Consumption, Piles--Quinsy,\r\n     Contagious Diseases, Rheumatism,\r\n     Cancer--Catarrh, Scrofula,\r\n     Dysentery--Diarrhea, Skin Diseases,\r\n     Dyspepsia--Dandruff, Tuberculosis,\r\n     Eczema--Erysipelas, Tumors--Ulcers,\r\n     Fevers, Throat Troubles\r\n\r\n--all diseases that begin with fever--all inflammations--all\r\ncatarrh--all contagious diseases--all the results of impure or poisoned\r\nblood. In nervous diseases Liquozone acts as a vitalizer, accomplishing\r\nwhat no drugs can do.\"\r\n\r\nThese diseases it conquers by destroying, in the human body, the germs\r\nwhich cause (or are alleged to cause) them. Such is Liquozone's claim.\r\n\r\nYet the Liquozone Company is not a patent medicine concern. We have\r\ntheir own word for it:\r\n\r\n\"We wish to state at the start that we are not patent medicine men, and\r\ntheir methods will not be employed by us.... Liquozone is too important\r\na product for quackery.\"\r\n\r\nThe head and center of this non-patent medicine cure-all is Douglas\r\nSmith. {024}Mr. Smith is by profession a promoter. He is credited with\r\na keen vision for profits. Several years ago he ran on a worthy ex-piano\r\ndealer, a Canadian by the name of Powley (we shall meet him again,\r\ntrailing clouds of glory in a splendid metamorphosis), who was selling\r\nwith some success a mixture known as Powley's Liquefied Ozone. This was\r\nguaranteed to kill any disease germ known to science. Mr. Smith examined\r\ninto the possibilities of the product, bought out Powley, moved the\r\nbusiness to Chicago and organized it as the Liquid Ozone Company. Liquid\r\nair was then much in the public prints. Mr. Smith, with the intuition\r\nof genius, and something more than genius' contempt for limitations,\r\nproceeded to catch the public eye with this frank assertion: \"Liquozone\r\nis liquid oxygen--that is all.\"\r\n\r\nIt is enough. That is, it would be enough if it were but true. Liquid\r\noxygen doesn't exist above a temperature of 229 degrees below zero. One\r\nspoonful would freeze a man's tongue, teeth and throat to equal solidity\r\nbefore he ever had time to swallow. If he could, by any miracle, manage\r\nto get it down, the undertaker would have to put him on the stove to\r\nthaw him out sufficiently for a respectable burial. Unquestionably\r\nLiquozone, if it were liquid oxygen, would kill germs, but that wouldn't\r\ndo the owner of the germs much good because he'd be dead before they had\r\ntime to realize that the temperature was falling. That it would cost a\r\ngood many dollars an ounce to make is, perhaps, beside the question. The\r\nobject of the company was not to make money, but to succor the\r\nsick and suffering. They say so themselves in their advertising. For\r\nsome reason, however, the business did not prosper as its new owner had\r\nexpected. A wider appeal to the sick and suffering was needed. Claude C.\r\nHopkins, formerly advertising manager for Dr. Shoop's Restorative (also\r\na cure-all) and perhaps the ablest exponent of his specialty in the\r\ncountry, was brought into the concern and a record-breaking campaign\r\nwas planned. This cost no little money, but the event proved it a good\r\ninvestment. President Smith's next move showed him to be the master of a\r\nsilver tongue, for he persuaded the members of a very prominent law firm\r\nwho were acting as the company's attorneys to take stock in the concern,\r\nand two of them to become directors. These gentlemen represent, in\r\nChicago, something more than the high professional standing of their\r\nfirm; they are prominent socially and forward in civic activities; in\r\nshort, just the sort of people needed by President Smith to bulwark his\r\ndubious enterprise with assured respectability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Men Who Back the Fake.\r\n\r\nIn the Equitable scandal there has been plenty of evidence to show\r\nthat directors often lend their names to enterprises of which they know\r\npractically nothing. This seems to have been the case with the lawyers.\r\nOne point they brought up: was Liquozone harmful? Positively not,\r\nDouglas Smith assured them. On the contrary, it was the greatest boon to\r\nthe sick in the world's history, and he produced an impressive bulk of\r\ntestimonials. This apparently satisfied them; they did not investigate\r\nthe testimonials, but accepted them at their face value. They did not\r\nlook into the advertising methods of the company; as nearly as I can\r\nfind out, they never saw an advertisement of Liquozone in the papers\r\nuntil long afterward. They just became stockholders and directors, that\r\nis all. They did as hundreds of other upright and well-meaning men had\r\ndone in lending themselves to a business of which they knew practically\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nWhile the lawyers continued to practice law, Messrs. Smith and Hopkins\r\nwere running the Liquozone Company. An enormous advertising campaign\r\nwas begun. Pamphlets were issued containing testimonials and claiming\r\n{025}the soundest of professional backing. Indeed, this matter of\r\nexpert testimony, chemical, medical and bacteriologic, is a specialty of\r\nLiquozone. Today, despite its reforms, it is supported by an ingenious\r\nsystem of pseudoscientific charlatanry. In justice to Mr. Hopkins it is\r\nbut fair to say that he is not responsible for the basic fraud; that the\r\ngeneral scheme was devised, and most of the bogus or distorted medical\r\nletters arranged, before his advent. But when I came to investigate\r\nthe product a few months ago I found that the principal defense against\r\nattacks consisted of scientific statements which would not bear analysis\r\nand medical letters not worth the paper they were written on. In\r\nthe first place, the Liquozone people have letters from chemists\r\nasseverating that the compound is chemically scientific.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFaked and Garbled Indorsements.\r\n\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {025}\r\n\r\nANALYSIS OF LIQUOZONE.\r\n\r\nSULPHURIC ACID -- About nine-tenths of one per cent. SULPHUROUS ACID --\r\nAbout three-tenths of one per cent WATER....... -- Nearly ninety-nine\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\nSulphuric acid is oil of vitriol. Sulphurous acid is also a corrosive\r\npoison. Liquozone is the combination of these two heavily diluted.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Dickman, Mackenzie & Potter, of Chicago, furnish a statement\r\nto the effect that the product is \"made up on scientific principles,\r\ncontains no substance deleterious to health and is an antiseptic and\r\ngermicide of the highest order.\" As chemists the Dickman firm stands\r\nhigh, but if sulphuric and sulphurous acids are not deleterious to their\r\nhealth there must be something peculiar about them as human beings. Mr.\r\nDeavitt of Chicago makes affidavit that the preparation is not made by\r\ncompounding drugs. A St. Louis bacteriologist testifies that it will\r\nkill germs (in culture tubes), and that it has apparently brought\r\nfavorable results in diarrhea, rheumatism and a finger which a\r\nguinea-pig had gnawed. These and other technical indorsements are set\r\nforth with great pomp and circumstance, but when analyzed they fail to\r\nbear out the claims of Liquozone as a medicine. Any past investigation\r\ninto the nature of Liquozone has brought a flood of \"indorsements\"\r\ndown on the investigator, many of them medical. My inquiries have been\r\nlargely along medical lines, because the makers of the drug claim the\r\nprivate support of many physicians and medical institutions, and such\r\ntestimony is the most convincing. \"Liquozone has the indorsement of an\r\noverwhelming number of medical authorities,\" says one of the pamphlets.\r\n\r\nOne of the inclosures sent to me was a letter from a young physician on\r\nthe staff of the Michael Reese Hospital, Chicago, who was paid $25 to\r\nmake bacteriologic tests in pure cultures. He reported: \"This is\r\nto certify that the fluid Liquozone handed to me for bacteriologic\r\nexamination has shown bacteriologic and germicidal properties.\" At the\r\nsame time he {026}informed the Liquozone agent that the mixture would\r\nbe worthless medicinally. He writes me as follows: \"I have never used or\r\nindorsed Liquozone; furthermore, its action would be harmful when taken\r\ninternally. Can report a case of gastric ulcer due probably to its use.\"\r\n\r\nLater in my investigations I came on this certificate again. It was\r\nquoted, in a report on Liquozone, made by the head of a prominent\r\nChicago laboratory for a medical journal, and it was designated \"Report\r\nmade by the Michael Reese Hospital,\" without comment or investigation.\r\nThis surprising garbling of the facts may have been due to carelessness,\r\nor it may have some connection with the fact that the laboratory\r\ninvestigation was about that time employed to do work for Mr. Douglas\r\nSmith, Liquozone's president.\r\n\r\nAnother document is an enthusiastic \"puff\" of Liquozone, quoted as being\r\ncontributed by Dr. W. H. Myers in _The New York Journal of Health_.\r\nThere is not nor ever has been any such magazine as _The New York\r\nJournal of Health_. Dr. W. H. Myers, or some person masquerading under\r\nthat name, got out a bogus \"dummy\" (for publication only, and not as\r\nguarantee of good faith) at a small charge to the Liquozone people.\r\n\r\nFor convenience I list several letters quoted or sent to me, with the\r\nresult of investigations.\r\n\r\nThe Suffolk Hospital and Dispensary of Boston, through its president,\r\nAlbert C. Smith, writes: \"Our test shows it (Liquozone) to possess great\r\nremedial value.\" The letter I have found to be genuine. But the hospital\r\n_medical_ authorities say that they know nothing of Liquozone and never\r\nprescribe it. If President Smith is prescribing it he is liable to\r\narrest, as he is not an M.D.\r\n\r\nA favoring letter from \"Dr.\" Fred W. Porter of Tampa, Fla., is quoted.\r\nThe Liquozone recipients of the letter forgot to mention that \"Dr.\"\r\nPorter is not an M.D., but a veterinary surgeon, as is shown by his\r\nletter head.\r\n\r\nDr. George E. Bliss of Maple Rapids, Mich., has used Liquozone for\r\ncancer patients. Dr. Bliss writes me, under the flaming headline of his\r\n\"cancer cure,\" that his letter is genuine and \"not solicitated.\"\r\n\r\nDr. A. A. Bell of Madison, Ga., is quoted as saying: \"I found Liquozone\r\nto invigorate digestion.\" He is _not_ quoted (although he wrote it)\r\nas saying that his own personal experience with it had shown it to be\r\nineffective. I have seen the original letter, and the unfavorable part\r\nof it was blue-penciled.\r\n\r\nFor a local indorsement of any medicine perhaps as strong a name as\r\ncould be secured in Chicago is that of Dr. Frank Billings. In the\r\noffices of _Collier's_ and elsewhere Dr. Billings has been cited by the\r\nLiquozone people as one of those medical men who were prevented only by\r\nethical considerations from publicly indorsing their nostrum, but who,\r\nnevertheless, privately avowed confidence in it. Here is what Dr.\r\nBillings has to say of this:\r\n\r\nChicago, Ill., July 31, 1905.\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of Collier's Weekly._\r\n\r\n_Dear Sir_:--I have never recommended Liquozone in any way to any one,\r\nnor have I expressed to any representative of the Liquozone Company, or\r\nto any other person, an opinion favorable to Liquozone. (Signed)\r\n\r\nFrank Billings, M.D.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading, \"Some Chicago Institutions which Constantly Employ\r\nLiquozone,\" are cited Hull House, the Chicago Orphan Asylum, the Home\r\nfor Incurables, the Evanston Hospital and the Old People's Home.\r\n\r\nLetters to the institutions elicited the information that Hull\r\nHouse {027}had never used the nostrum, and had protested against the\r\nstatement; that the Orphan Asylum had experimented with it only for\r\nexternal applications, and with such dubious results that it was soon\r\ndropped; that it had been shut out of the Home for Incurables; that a\r\nfew private patients in the Old People's Home had purchased it, but on\r\nno recommendation from the physicians; and that the Evanston Hospital\r\nknew nothing of Liquozone and had never used it.\r\n\r\nHaving a professional interest in the \"overwhelming number of medical\r\nindorsements\" claimed by Liquozone, a Chicago physician, Dr. W. H.\r\nFelton, went to the company's offices and asked to see the medical\r\nevidence. None was forthcoming; the lists, he was informed, were in the\r\npress and could not be shown. He then asked for the official book for\r\nphysicians advertised by the firm, containing \"a great deal of evidence\r\nfrom authorities whom all physicians respect.\" This also, they said, was\r\n\"in the press.\" As a matter of fact, it has never come out of the press\r\nand never will; the special book project has been dropped.\r\n\r\nOne more claim and I am done with the \"scientific evidence.\" In a\r\npamphlet issued by the company and since withdrawn occurs this sprightly\r\nsketch:\r\n\r\n\"Liquozone is the discovery of Professor Pauli, the great German\r\nchemist, who worked for twenty years to learn how to liquefy oxygen.\r\nWhen Pauli first mentioned his purpose men laughed at him. The idea\r\nof liquefying gas--of circulating a liquid oxygen in the blood--seemed\r\nimpossible. But Pauli was one of those men who set their whole hearts on\r\na problem and follow it out either to success or to the grave. So Pauli\r\nfollowed out this problem though it took twenty years. He clung to it\r\nthrough discouragements which would have led any lesser man to abandon\r\nit. He worked on it despite poverty and ridicule,\" etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLiquozone Kills a Great German Scientist.\r\n\r\nAlas for romance! The scathing blight of the legal mind descended on\r\nthis touching story. The lawyer-directors would have none of \"Professor\r\nPauli, the great German chemist,\" and Liquozone destroyed him, as it\r\nhad created him. Not totally destroyed, however, for from those rainbow\r\nwrappings, now dissipated, emerges the humble but genuine figure of our\r\nold acquaintance, Mr. Powley, the ex-piano man of Toronto. He is the\r\nprototype of the Teutonic savant. So much the Liquozone people now\r\nadmit, with the defence that the change of Powley to Pauli was, at most,\r\na harmless flight of fancy, \"so long as we were not attempting to use a\r\nname famous in medicine or bacteriology in order to add prestige to the\r\nproduct.\" A plea which commends itself by its ingeniousness at least.\r\n\r\nGone is \"Professor Pauli,\" and with him much of his kingdom lies. In\r\nfact, I believe there is no single definite intentional misstatement in\r\nthe new Liquozone propaganda. For some months there has been a cessation\r\nof all advertising, and an overhauling of materials under the censorship\r\nof the lawyer-directors, who were suddenly aroused to the real situation\r\nby a storm of protest and criticism, and, rather late in the day, began\r\nto \"sit up and take notice.\" The company has recently sent me a copy of\r\nthe new booklet on which all their future advertising is to be based.\r\nThe most important of their fundamental misstatements to go by the board\r\nis \"Liquozone is liquid oxygen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Liquozone contains no free oxygen,\" declares the revision frankly. No\r\ntestimonials are to be printed. The faked and garbled letters are to\r\nbe dropped from the files. There is no claim of \"overwhelming medical\r\nindorsement.\" Nor is the statement {028}anywhere made that Liquozone\r\nwill cure any of the diseases in which it is recommended. Yet such is\r\nthe ingenuity with which the advertising manager has presented his case\r\nthat the new newspaper exploitation appeals to the same hopes and\r\nfears, with the same implied promises, as the old. \"I'm well because of\r\nLiquozone,\" in huge type, is followed by the list of diseases \"where it\r\napplies.\" And the new list is more comprehensive than the old.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Ills Look Alike to Liquozone.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {028}\r\n\r\nJust as to Peruna all ills are catarrh, so to Liquozone every disease is\r\na germ disease. Every statement in the new prospectus of cure \"has been\r\nsubmitted to competent authorities, and is exactly true and correct.,\"\r\ndeclares the recently issued pamphlet, \"Liquozone, and Tonic Germicide\";\r\nand the pamphlet goes on to ascribe, among other ills, asthma, gout,\r\nneuralgia, dyspepsia, goiter and \"most forms of kidney, liver and heart\r\ntroubles\" to germs. I don't know just which of the eminent authorities\r\nwho have been working for the Liquozone Company fathers this remarkable\r\nand epoch-making discovery. {029}\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the writer of the Liquozone pamphlet, and the experts who\r\nedited it, got a little mixed on their germs in the matter of malaria.\r\n\"Liquozone is deadly to vegetable natter, but helpful to animals,\"\r\ndeclares the pamphlet.... \"Germs are vegetables\"--and that is the reason\r\nthat Liquozone kills them. But malaria, which Liquozone is supposed to\r\ncure, is positively known to be due to animal organisms in the blood,\r\nnot vegetable. Therefore, if the claims are genuine, liquozone, being\r\n\"helpful to animals,\" will aid and abet the malaria organism in his\r\nnefarious work, and the Liquozone Company, as well-intentioned men,\r\nworking in the interests of health, ought to warn all sufferers of this\r\nclass from use of their animal-stimulator.\r\n\r\nThe old claim is repeated that nothing enters into the production of\r\nLiquozone but gases, water and a little harmless coloring matter, and\r\nthat the process requires large apparatus and from eight to fourteen\r\ndays' time. I have seen the apparatus, consisting of huge wooden vats,\r\nand can testify to their impressive size. And I have the assurance of\r\nseveral gentlemen whose word (except in print) I am willing to take,\r\nthat fourteen days' time is employed in impregnating every output of\r\nliquid with gas. The result, so far as can be determined chemically\r\nor medicinally, is precisely the same as could be achieved in fourteen\r\nseconds by mixing the acids with the water. The product is still\r\nsulphurous and sulphuric acid heavily diluted, that is all.\r\n\r\nWill the compound destroy germs in the human body? This is, after all,\r\nthe one overwhelmingly important point for determination; for if it\r\nwill, all the petty fakers and forgery, the liquid oxygen and Professor\r\nPauli and the mythical medical journalism may be forgiven. For more than\r\nfour months now _Collier's_ has been patiently awaiting some proof of\r\nthe internal germicidal qualities of Liquozone None has been\r\nforthcoming except specious generalities from scientific employés of\r\nthe company--and testimonials. The value of testimonials as evidence is\r\nconsidered in a later article. Liquozone's are not more convincing than\r\nothers. Of the chemists and bacteriologists employed by the Liquozone\r\nCompany there is not one who will risk his professional reputation on\r\nthe simple and essential statement that Liquozone taken internally kills\r\ngerms in the human system. One experiment has been made by Mr. Schoen\r\nof Chicago, which I am asked to regard as indicating in some degree\r\na deterrent action of Liquozone on the disease of anthrax. Of two\r\nguinea-pigs inoculated with anthrax, one which was dosed with Liquozone\r\nsurvived the other, not thus treated, by several hours. Bacteriologists\r\nemployed by us to make a similar test failed, because of the surprising\r\nfact that the dose as prescribed by Mr. Schoen promptly killed the first\r\nguinea-pig to which it was administered. A series of guinea-pig tests\r\nwas then arranged (the guinea-pig is the animal which responds to germ\r\ninfection most nearly as the human organism responds), at which Dr.\r\nGradwohl, representing the Liquozone Company, was present, and in which\r\nhe took part. The report follows: {030}\r\n\r\nLEDERLE LABORATORIES.\r\n\r\nSanitary, Chemical and Bacteriologic Investigations.\r\n\r\n518 FIFTH AVENUE,\r\n\r\nNEW YORK CITY.\r\n\r\nOctober 21, 1905,\r\n\r\nAnthrax Test. Twenty-four guinea-pigs were inoculated with anthrax\r\nbacilli, under the same conditions, the same amount being given to each.\r\nThe representative of the Liquozone people selected the twelve pigs for\r\ntreatment. These animals were given Liquozone is 5 c.c. doses for three\r\nhours. In twenty-four hours all pigs were dead--the treated and the\r\nuntreated ones.\r\n\r\nSecond Anthrax Test. Eight guinea-pigs were Inoculated under the same\r\nconditions with a culture of anthrax sent by the Liquozone people. Four\r\nof these animals were treated for three hours with Liquozone as in\r\nthe last experiment. These died also in from thirty-six to forty-eight\r\nhours, as did the remaining four.\r\n\r\nDiphtheria Test. Six guinea-pigs were inoculated with diphtheria\r\nbacilli and treated with Liquozone. They all died in from forty-eight\r\nto seventy-two hours. Two out of three controls (i. e., untreated\r\nguinea-pigs) remained alive after receiving the same amount of culture.\r\n\r\nTuberculosis Test. Eight guinea-pigs were inoculated with tubercle\r\nbacilli. Four of these animals were treated for eight hours with 5 c.c.\r\nof a 20 per cent, solution of Liquozole. Four received no Liquozone. At\r\nthe end of twenty-four days all the animals were killed.\r\n\r\nFairly developed tuberculosis was present in all.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, we would say that the Liquozone had absolutely no curative\r\neffect, but did, when given in pure form, lower the resistance of the\r\nanimals, so that they died a little earlier than those not treated.\r\n\r\nLederle Laboratories.\r\n\r\nBy Ernst J. Lederle.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gradwohl, representing the Liquozone Company, stated that he was\r\nsatisfied of the fairness of the tests. He further declared that in his\r\nopinion the tests had proved satisfactorily the total ineffectiveness of\r\nLiquozone as an internal germicide.\r\n\r\nBut these experiments show more than that. They show that in so far as\r\nLiquozone has any effect, it tends to lower the resistance of the body\r\nto an invading disease. That is, in the very germ diseases for which\r\nit is advocated, _Liquozone may decrease the chances of the patient's\r\nrecovery with every dose that is swallowed, but certainly would not\r\nincrease them_.\r\n\r\nIn its own field Liquozone is _sui generis_. On the ethical side,\r\nhowever, there are a few \"internal germicides,\" and one of these comes\r\nin for mention here, not that it is in the least like Liquozone in\r\nits composition, but because by its monstrous claims it challenges\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nSince the announcement of this article, and before, _Collier's_ has been\r\nin receipt of much virtuous indignation from a manufacturer of remedies\r\nwhich, he claims, Liquozone copies. Charles Marchand has been the most\r\nactive enemy of the Douglas Smith product. He has attacked the makers in\r\nprint, organized a society, and established a publication mainly devoted\r\nto their destruction, and circulated far and wide injurious literature\r\n(most of it true) about their product. Of the relative merits of\r\nHydrozone, Glycozone (Marchand's products); and Liquozone, I know\r\nnothing; but I know that the Liquozone Company has never in its history\r\nput forth so shameful an advertisement as the one reproduced on page\r\n28, [IMAGE ==>] {028} signed by Marchand, and printed in the New Orleans\r\n_States_ when the yellow-fever scare was at its height. {031}\r\n\r\nAnd Hydrozone is an \"ethical\" remedy; its advertisements are to be found\r\nin reputable medical journals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Same Old Fake.\r\n\r\nPartly by reason of Marchand's energy, no nostrum in the country has\r\nbeen so widely attacked as the Chicago product. Occasional deaths,\r\nattributed (in some cases unjustly) to its use, have been made the most\r\nof, and scores of analyses have been printed, so that in all parts\r\nof the country the true nature of the nostrum is beginning to be\r\nunderstood. The prominence of its advertising and the reckless breadth\r\nof its claims have made it a shining mark. North Dakota has forbidden\r\nits sale. San Francisco has decreed against it; so has Lexington, Ky.,\r\nand there are signs that it will have a fight tor its life soon in\r\nother cities. It is this looming danger that impelled Liquozone to an\r\nattempted reform last summer. Yet, in spite of the censorship of\r\nits legal lights, in spite of the revision of its literature by its\r\nscientific experts, in spite of its ingenious avoidance of specifically\r\nfalse claims in the advertising which is being scattered broadcast\r\nto-day, Liquozone is now what it was before its rehabilitation, a fraud\r\nwhich owes its continued existence to the laxity of our public health\r\nmethods and the cynical tolerance of the national conscience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV--THE SUBTLE POISONS.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Dec. 2, 1006. {032}\r\n\r\nIgnorance and credulous hope make the market for most proprietary\r\nremedies. Intelligent people are not given largely to the use of the\r\nglaringly advertised cure-alls, such as Liquozone or Peruna. Nostrums\r\nthere are, however, which reach the thinking classes as well as the\r\nreadily gulled. Depending, as they do, for their success on the lure of\r\nsome subtle drug concealed under a trademark name, or some opiate not\r\nreadily obtainable under its own label, these are the most dangerous\r\nof all quack medicines, not only in their immediate effect, but because\r\nthey create enslaving appetites, sometimes obscure and difficult of\r\ntreatment, most often tragically obvious. Of these concealed drugs the\r\nheadache powders are the most widely used, and of the headache powders\r\nOrangeine is the most conspicuous.\r\n\r\nOrangeine prints its formula. It is, therefore, its proprietors claim,\r\nnot a secret remedy. But to all intents and purposes it is secret,\r\nbecause to the uninformed public the vitally important word \"acetanilid\"\r\nin the formula means little or nothing. Worse than its secrecy is its\r\npolicy of careful and dangerous deception. Orangeine, like practically\r\nall the headache powders, is simply a mixture of acetanilid with less\r\npotent drugs. Of course, there is no orange in it, except the orange hue\r\nof the boxes and wrappers which is its advertising symbol. But this is\r\nan unimportant deception. The wickedness of the fraud lies in this:\r\nthat whereas the nostrum, by virtue of its acetanilid content, thins the\r\nblood, depresses the heart and finally undermines the whole system, it\r\nclaims _to strengthen the heart and to produce better blood_. Thus\r\nfar in the patent medicine field I have not encountered so direct and\r\nspecific an inversion of the true facts.\r\n\r\nRecent years have added to the mortality records of our cities a\r\nsurprising and alarming number of sudden deaths from heart failure. In\r\nthe year 1902 New York City alone reported a death rate from this cause\r\nof 1.34 per thousand of population; that is about six times as great as\r\nthe typhoid fever death record. It was about that time that the headache\r\npowders were being widely advertised, and there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the increased mortality, which is still in evidence, is due\r\nlargely to the secret weakening of the heart by acetanilid. Occasionally\r\na death occurs so definitely traceable to this poison that there is\r\nno room for doubt, as in the following report by Dr. J. L. Miller, of\r\nChicago, in the _Journal of the American Medical Association_, on the\r\ndeath of Mrs. Frances Robson:\r\n\r\n\"I was first called to see the patient, a young lady, physically\r\nsound, who had been taking Orangeine powders for a number of weeks for\r\ninsomnia. The rest of the family noticed that she was very blue, and\r\nfor this reason I was called. When I saw the patient she complained of\r\na sense of faintness and inability to keep warm. At this time she had\r\ntaken a box of six Orangeine powders within about eight hours. She was\r\nwarned of the danger of continuing the indiscriminate use of the remedy,\r\nbut insisted that many of her friends had used it and claimed that it\r\nwas harmless. The family promised to see that she did not obtain any\r\nmore of the remedy. Three days later, however, I was called to the house\r\nand found the patient dead. The family said that she had gone to her\r\nroom the evening before in her usual health. The next morning, the\r\npatient not appearing, they investigated and found her dead. The case\r\nwas reported to the coroner, and the coroner's verdict was: 'Death was\r\nfrom the effect of an overdose of Orangeine {033}powders administered by\r\nher own hand, whether accidentally or otherwise, unknown to the jury.'\"\r\n\r\nLast July an 18-year-old Philadelphia girl got a box of Orangeine\r\npowders at a drug store, having been told that they would cure headache.\r\nThere was nothing on the label or in the printed matter inclosed with\r\nthe preparation warning her of the dangerous character of the nostrum.\r\nFollowing the printed advice, she took two powders. In three hours she\r\nwas dead. Coroner Dugan's verdict follows:\r\n\r\n\"Mary A. Bispels came to her death from kidney and heart disease,\r\naggravated by poisoning by acetanilid taken in Orangeine headache\r\npowders.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrescribing Without Authority.\r\n\r\nYet this poison is being recommended every day by people who know\r\nnothing of it and nothing of the susceptibility of the friends to whom\r\nthey advocate it. For example, here is a testimonial from the Orangeine\r\nbooklet:\r\n\r\n\"Miss A. A. Phillips, 60 Powers street, Brooklyn, writes: 'I always keep\r\nOrangeine in my desk at school, and through its frequent applications to\r\nthe sick I am called both \"doctor and magician.\"'\"\r\n\r\nIf the school herein referred to is a public school, the matter is\r\none for the Board of Education; if a private school, for the Health\r\nDepartment or the county medical society. That a school teacher should\r\nbe allowed to continue giving, however well meaning her foolhardiness\r\nmay be, a harmful and possibly fatal dose to the children intrusted\r\nto her care seems rather a significant commentary on the quality of\r\nwatchfulness in certain institutions.\r\n\r\nObscurity as to the real nature of the drug, fostered by careful\r\ndeception, is the safeguard of the acetanilid vender. Were its perilous\r\nquality known, the headache powder would hardly be so widely used. And\r\nwere the even more important fact that the use of these powders becomes\r\na habit, akin to the opium or cocain habits, understood by the public,\r\nthe repeated sales which are the basis of Orangeine's prosperity would\r\nundoubtedly be greatly cut down. Orangeine fulfills the prime requisite\r\nof a patent medicine in being a good \"repeater.\" Did it not foster\r\nits own demand in the form of a persistent craving, it would hardly be\r\nprofitable. Its advertising invites to the formation of an addiction to\r\nthe drug. \"Get the habit,\" it might logically advertise, in imitation of\r\na certain prominent exploitation along legitimate lines. Not only is\r\nits value as a cure for nervousness and headaches insisted on, but its\r\nprospective dupes are advised to take this powerful drug as a _bracer_.\r\n\r\n\"When, as often, you reach home tired in body and mind... take an\r\nOrangeine powder, lie down for thirty minutes' nap--if possible--anyway,\r\nrelax, then take another.\"\r\n\r\n\"To induce sleep, take an Orangeine powder immediately before retiring.\r\nWhen wakeful, an Orangeine powder will have a normalizing, quieting\r\neffect.\"\r\n\r\nIt is also recommended as a good thing to begin the day's work on in the\r\nmorning--that is, take Orangeine night, morning and between meals!\r\n\r\nThese powders pretend to cure asthma, biliousness, headaches, colds,\r\ncatarrh and grip (dose: powder every four hours during the day for a\r\nweek!--a pretty fair start on the Orangeine habit), diarrhea, hay fever,\r\ninsomnia, influenza, neuralgia, seasickness and sciatica.\r\n\r\nOf course, they do not cure any of these; they do practically nothing\r\nbut give temporary relief by depressing the heart. With the return\r\nto normal conditions of blood circulation comes a recurrence of the\r\nnervousness, {034}headache, or what not, and the incentive to more of\r\nthe drug, until it becomes a necessity. In my own acquaintance I know\r\nhalf a dozen persons who have come to depend on one or another of these\r\nheadache preparations to keep them going. One young woman whom I have\r\nin mind told me quite innocently that she had been taking five or\r\nsix Orangeine powders a day for several months, having changed from\r\nKoehler's powders when some one told her that the latter were dangerous!\r\nBecause of her growing paleness her husband had called in their\r\nphysician, but neither of them had mentioned the little matter of the\r\nnostrum, having accepted with a childlike faith the asseverations of\r\nits beneficent qualities. Yet they were of an order of intelligence that\r\nwould scoff at the idea of drinking Swamp-Root.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {034}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Acetanilid Death Record.\r\n\r\nThis list of fatalities is made up from statements published in the\r\nnewspapers. In every case the person who died had taken to relieve a\r\nheadache or as a bracer a patent medicine containing acetanilid, without\r\na doctor's prescription.

In almost every instance the local papers suppressed\r\nthe name of the fatal remedy, {035}Peruna. That particular victim\r\nhad the beginning of the typical blue skin pictured in the street-car\r\nadvertisements of Orangeine (the advertisements are a little mixed, as\r\nthey put the blue hue on the \"before taking,\" whereas it should go on\r\nthe \"after taking\"). And, by the way, I can conscientiously recommend\r\nOrangeine, Koehler's powders, Royal Pain powders and others of that\r\nclass to women who wish for a complexion of a dead, pasty white,\r\nverging to a puffy blueness under the eyes and about the lips. Patient\r\nuse of these drugs will even produce an interesting and picturesque, if\r\nnot intrinsically beautiful, purplish-gray hue of the face and neck.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {035}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDrugs That Deprave.\r\n\r\nAnother acquaintance writes me that he is unable to dissuade his wife\r\nfrom the constant use of both Orangeine and Bromo-Seltzer, although her\r\n{036}health is breaking down. Often it is difficult for a physician to\r\ndiagnose these cases because the symptoms are those of certain diseases\r\nin which the blood deteriorates, and, moreover, the victim, as in opium\r\nand cocain slavery, will positively deny having used the drug. A case\r\nof acetanilid addiction (in \"cephalgin,\" an ethical proprietary) is thus\r\nreported:\r\n\r\n\"When the drug was withheld the patient soon began to exhibit all the\r\ntraits peculiar to the confirmed morphine-maniac--moral depravity\r\nand the like. She employed every possible means to obtain the drug,\r\nattempting even to bribe the nurse, and, this failing, even members of\r\nthe family.\" Another report of a similar case (and there are plenty of\r\nthem to select from) reads:\r\n\r\n\"Stomach increasingly irritable; skin a grayish or light purplish hue;\r\npalpitation and slight enlargement of the heart; great prostration, with\r\npains in the region of the heart; blood discolored to a chocolate\r\nhue. The patient denied that she had been using acetanilid, but it was\r\ndiscovered that for a year she had been obtaining it in the form of\r\na proprietary remedy and had contracted a regular 'habit.' On the\r\ndiscontinuance of the drug the symptoms disappeared. She was discharged\r\nfrom the hospital as cured, but soon returned to the use of the drug and\r\napplied for readmission, displaying the former symptoms.\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {036}\r\n\r\nNEW YORK STATE'S NEW POISON LABEL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a cocain-laden medicine.\r\n\r\nWhere I have found a renegade physician making his millions out of\r\nPeruna, or a professional promoter trading on the charlatanry of\r\nLiquozone, it has seemed superfluous to comment on the personality of\r\nthe men. They are what their business connotes. With Orangeine the case\r\nis somewhat different. Its proprietors are men of standing in other and\r\nreputable spheres of activity. Charles L. Bartlett, its president, is a\r\ngraduate of Yale University and a man of some prominence in its alumni\r\naffairs. Orangeine is a side issue with him. Professionally he is the\r\nwestern representative of Ivory Soap, one of the heaviest of legitimate\r\nadvertisers, and he doubtless learned from this the value of skillful\r\nexploitation. Next to Mr. Bartlett, the largest owner of stock (unless\r\nhe has recently sold out) is William Gillette, the actor, whose\r\nenthusiastic indorsement of the powders is known in a personal sense to\r\nthe profession which he follows, and in print to hundreds of thousands\r\nof theater-goers who have read it in their programs. Whatever these\r\ngentlemen may think of their product (and I understand that, incredible\r\nas it may seem, both of them are constant users of it and genuine\r\nbelievers in it), the methods by which it is sold and the essential and\r\nmendacious concealment of its real nature illustrate the {037}level to\r\nwhich otherwise upright and decent men are brought by a business which\r\ncan not profitably include either uprightness or decency in its methods.\r\n\r\nOrangeine is less dangerous, except in extent of use, than many other\r\nacetanilid mixtures which are much the same thing under a different\r\nname. A friend of mine with a weak heart took the printed dose of\r\nLaxative Bromo Quinin and lay at the point of death for a week. There\r\nis no word of warning on the label. In many places samples of headache\r\npowders are distributed on the doorsteps. The St. Louis Chronicle\r\nrecords a result:\r\n\r\n\"Huntington, W. Va., Aug. 15, 1905.--While Mrs. Thomas Patterson was\r\npreparing supper last evening she was stricken with a violent headache\r\nand took a headache powder that had been thrown in at her door the day\r\nbefore. Immediately she was seized with spasms and in an hour she was\r\ndead.\"\r\n\r\nThat even the lower order of animals is not safe is shown by a canine\r\ntragedy in Altoona, Pa., where a prize collie dog incautiously devoured\r\nthree sample tablets and died in an hour. Yet the distributing agents of\r\nthese mixtures do not hesitate to lie about them. Rochester, N. Y., has\r\nan excellent ordinance forbidding the distribution of sample medicines,\r\nexcept by permission of the health officer. An agent for Miniature\r\nHeadache Powders called on Dr. Goler with a request for leave to\r\ndistribute 25,000 samples.\r\n\r\n\"What's your formula?\" asked the official.\r\n\r\n\"Salicylate of soda and sugar of milk,\" replied the traveling man.\r\n\r\n\"And you pretend to cure headaches with that?\" said the doctor. \"I'll\r\nlook into it.\"\r\n\r\nAnalysis showed that the powders were an acetanilid mixture. The sample\r\nman didn't wait for the result. He hasn't been back to Rochester since,\r\nalthough Dr. Goler is hopefully awaiting him.\r\n\r\nBromo-Seltzer is commonly sold in drug stores, both by the bottle and\r\nat soda fountains. The full dose is \"a heaping teaspoonful.\" A heaping\r\nteaspoonful of Bromo-Seltzer means about ten grains of acetanilid. The\r\nUnited States Pharmacopeia dose is four grains; five grains have been\r\nknown to produce fatal results. The prescribed dose of Bromo-Seltzer is\r\ndangerous and has been known to produce sudden collapse.\r\n\r\nMegrimine is a warranted headache cure that is advertised in several\r\nof the magazines. A newly arrived guest at a Long Island house party\r\nbrought along several lots and distributed them as a remedy for headache\r\nand that tired feeling. It was perfectly harmless, she declared; didn't\r\nthe advertisement say \"leaves no unpleasant effects\"? As a late dance\r\nthe night before had left its impress on the feminine members of the\r\nhouse party, there was a general acceptance of the \"bracer.\" That\r\nnight the local physician visited the house party (on special \"rush\"\r\ninvitation), and was well satisfied to pull all his patients through.\r\nHe had never before seen acetanilid poisoning by wholesale. A Chicago\r\ndruggist writes me that the wife of a prominent physician buys Megrimine\r\nof him by the half-dozen lots secretly. She has the habit.\r\n\r\nOn October 9, W. H. Hawkins, superintendent of the American Detective\r\nAssociation, a mar of powerful physique and apparently in good health,\r\nwent to a drug store in Anderson, Ind., and took a dose of Dr. Davis'\r\nHeadache Powders. He then boarded a car for Marion and shortly after\r\nfell to the floor, dead. The coroner's verdict is reproduced on page 35.\r\n{035} Whether these powders are made by a Dr. W. C. Davis, of\r\nIndianapolis, who makes Anti-Headache, I am unable to state.\r\nAnti-Headache describes itself as \"a compound of mild ingredients and\r\npositively contains no dangerous drugs.\" It is almost pure acetanilid.\r\n\r\nIn the \"ethical\" field the harm done by this class of proprietaries is\r\nperhaps {038}as great as in the open field, for many of those which are\r\nsupposed to be sold only in prescriptions are as freely distributed to\r\nthe laity as Peruna. And their advertising is hardly different.\r\n\r\nAntikamnia, claiming to be an \"ethical\" remedy, and advertising through\r\nthe medical press by methods that would, with little alteration, fit any\r\npatent painkiller on the market, is no less dangerous or fraudulent than\r\nthe Orangeine class which it almost exactly parallels in composition. It\r\nwas at first exploited as a \"new synthetical coal-tar derivative,\"\r\nwhich it isn't and never was. It is simply half or more acetanilid\r\n(some analyses show as high as 68 per cent.) with other unimportant\r\ningredients in varying proportions. In a booklet entitled \"Light on\r\nPain,\" and distributed on doorsteps, I find under an alphabetical list\r\nof diseases this invitation to form the Antikamnia habit:\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {038}\r\n\r\n\"Nervousness (overwork and excesses)--Dose: One Antikamnia tablet every\r\ntwo or three hours.\r\n\r\n\"Shoppers' or Sightseers' Headache--Dose: Two Antikamnia tablets every\r\nthree hours.\r\n\r\n\"Worry (nervousness, 'the blues')--Dose: One or two Antikamnia and\r\nCodein tablets every three hours.\"\r\n\r\nCodein is obtained from opium. The codein habit is well known to all\r\ninstitutions which treat drug addictions, and is recognized as being no\r\nless difficult to cure than the morphin habit.\r\n\r\nThe following well-known \"remedies\" both \"ethical\" and \"patent,\" depend\r\nfor their results upon the heart-depressing action of Acetanilid:\r\n\r\n     Orangeine\r\n     Bromo-Seltzer\r\n     Megrimine\r\n     Anti-Headache\r\n     Ammonol\r\n     Salacetin\r\n     Royal Pain Powders Dr. Davis's Headache Phenalgin\r\n     Cephalgin\r\n     Miniature Headache Powders\r\n     Powders\r\n\r\nA typical instance of what Antikamnia will do for its users is that of a\r\nPennsylvania merchant, 50 years old, who had declined, without apparent\r\nAntikamnia {039}cause, from 140 to 116 pounds, and was finally brought\r\nto Philadelphia in a state of stupor. His pulse was barely perceptible,\r\nhis skin dusky and his blood of a deep chocolate color. On reviving he\r\nwas questioned as to whether he had been taking headache powders. He\r\nhad, for several years. What kind? Antikamnia; sometimes in the plain\r\ntablets, at other times Antikamnia with codein. How many? About twelve\r\na day. He was greatly surprised to learn that this habit was responsible\r\nfor his condition.\r\n\r\n\"My doctor gave it to me for insomnia,\" he said, and it appeared that\r\nthe patient had never even been warned of the dangerous character of the\r\ndrug.\r\n\r\nWere it obtainable, I would print here the full name and address of\r\nthat attending physician, as one unfit, either through ignorance or\r\ncarelessness, to practice his profession. And there would be other\r\nphysicians all over the country who would, under that description,\r\nsuffer the same indictment within their own minds for starting innocent\r\npatients on a destructive and sometimes fatal course. For it is the\r\ncareless or conscienceless physician who gets the customer for the\r\n\"ethical\" headache remedies, and the customer, once secured, pays\r\na profit, very literally, with his own blood. Once having taken\r\nAntikamnia, the layman, unless informed as to its true nature, will\r\noften return to the drug store and purchase it with the impression that\r\nit is a specific drug, like quinin or potassium chlorate, instead of a\r\ndisguised poison, exploited and sold under patent rights by a private\r\nconcern. The United States Postoffice, in its broad tolerance, permits\r\nthe Antikamnia company to send through the mails little sample boxes\r\ncontaining tablets enough to kill an ordinary man, and these samples are\r\nsent not only to physicians, as is the rule with ethical remedies,\r\nbut to lawyers, business men, \"brain workers\" and other prospective\r\npurchasing classes. The box bears the lying statement: \"No drug\r\nhabit--no heart effect.\"\r\n\r\nJust as this is going to press the following significant case comes in\r\nfrom Iowa:\r\n\r\n\"Farmington, Iowa, Oct. 6.-- (Special to the\r\nConstitution-Democrat.)--Mrs. Hattie Kick, one of the best and most\r\nprominent ladies of Farmington, died rather suddenly Wednesday morning\r\nat 10 o'clock from an overdose of Antikamnia, which she took for a\r\nsevere headache from which she was suffering. Mrs. Kick was subject to\r\nsevere headaches and was a frequent user of Antikamnia, her favorite\r\nremedy for this ailment.\"\r\n\r\nThere is but one safeguard in the use of these remedies: to regard them\r\nas one would regard opium and to employ them only with the consent of\r\na physician who understands their true nature. Acetanilid has its uses,\r\nbut not as a generic painkiller. Pain is a symptom; you can drug it away\r\ntemporarily, but it will return clamoring for more payment until the\r\nfinal price is hopeless enslavement. Were the skull and bones on every\r\nbox of this class of poison the danger would be greatly minimized.\r\n\r\nWith opium and cocain the case is different. The very words are danger\r\nsignals. Legal restrictions safeguard the public, to a greater or less\r\ndegree, from their indiscriminate use. Normal people do not knowingly\r\ntake opium or its derivatives except with the sanction of a physician,\r\nand there is even spreading abroad a belief (surely an expression of the\r\nprimal law of self-preservation) that the licensed practitioner leans\r\ntoo readily toward the convenient narcotics.\r\n\r\nBut this perilous stuff is the ideal basis for a patent medicine because\r\nits results are immediate (though never permanent), and it is its own\r\nbest advertisement in that one dose imperatively calls for another.\r\nTherefore it behooves the manufacturer of opiates to disguise the use of\r\nthe drug. This he does in varying forms, and he has found his greatest\r\nsuccess in the \"cough and consumption cures\" and the soothing syrup\r\nclass. The former of these will be considered in another article. As\r\nto the \"soothing syrups,\" {040}designed for the drugging of helpless\r\ninfants, even the trade does not know how many have risen, made their\r\nbase profit and subsided. A few survive, probably less harmful than\r\nthe abandoned ones, on the average, so that by taking the conspicuous\r\nsurvivors as a type I am at least doing no injustice to the class.\r\n\r\nSome years ago I heard a prominent New York lawyer, asked by his office\r\nscrub woman to buy a ticket for some \"association\" ball, say to her:\r\n\"How can you go to these affairs, Nora, when you have two young children\r\nat home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure, they're all right,\" she returned, blithely; \"just wan teaspoonful\r\nof Winslow's an' they lay like the dead till mornin'.\"\r\n\r\nWhat eventually became of the scrub woman's children I don't know. The\r\ntypical result of this practice is described by a Detroit physician who\r\nhas been making a special study of Michigan's high mortality rate:\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Winslow's Soothing Syrup is extensively used among the poorer\r\nclasses as a means of pacifying their babies. These children eventually\r\ncome into the hands of physicians with a greater or less addiction to\r\nthe opium habit. The sight of a parent drugging a helpless infant into a\r\nsemi-comatose condition is not an elevating one for this civilized age,\r\nand it is a very common practice. [IMAGE ==>] {040}I can give you one\r\nillustration from my own hospital experience, which was told me by the\r\nfather of the girl. A middle-aged railroad man of Kansas City had a\r\nsmall daughter with summer diarrhea. For this she was given a patent\r\ndiarrhea medicine. It controlled the trouble, but as soon as the remedy\r\nwas withdrawn the diarrhea returned. At every withdrawal the trouble\r\nbegan anew, and the final result was that they never succeeded in curing\r\nthis daughter of the opium habit which had taken its hold on her. It\r\nwas some years afterward that the parents became aware that she had\r\ncontracted the habit, when the physician took away the patent medicine\r\nand gave the girl morphin, with exactly the same result which she had\r\nexperienced with the patent remedy. At the time the father told me\r\nthis story his daughter was 19 years of age, an only child of wealthy\r\nparents, and one who could have had every advantage in life, but who was\r\na complete wreck in every way as a result of the opium habit. The father\r\ntold me, with tears in his eyes, that he would rather she had died with\r\nthe original illness than to have lived to become the creature which she\r\nthen was.\" The proprietor of a drug store in San José, Cal., writes to\r\n_Collier's_ as follows:\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {041}\r\n\r\n\"I have a good customer, a married woman with five children, all under\r\n10 years of age. When her last baby was born, about a year ago, the\r\nfirst thing she did was to order a bottle of Winslow's Soothing Syrup,\r\nand every {042}week another bottle was bought at first, until now a\r\nbottle is bought every third day. Why? Because the baby has become\r\nhabituated to the drug. I am not well enough acquainted with the family\r\nto be able to say that the weaned children show any present abnormality\r\nof health due to the opium contained in the drug, but the after-effects\r\nof opium have been thus described.... Another instance, quite as\r\nstartling, was that of a mother who gave large quantities of soothing\r\nsyrup to two of her children in infancy; then, becoming convinced of\r\nits danger, abandoned its use. These children in middle life became\r\nneurotics, spirit and drug-takers. Three children born later and not\r\ngiven any drugs in early life grew up strong and healthy.\r\n\r\n\"I fear the children of the woman in question will all suffer for their\r\nmother's ignorance, or worse, in later life, and have tried to do my\r\nduty by sending word to the mother of the harmful nature of the stuff,\r\nbut without effect.\r\n\r\n\"P. S.--How many neurotics, fiends and criminals may not 'Mrs. Winslow'\r\nbe sponsor for?\"\r\n\r\nThis query is respectfully referred to the Anglo-American Drug Company,\r\nof New York,' which makes its handsome profit from this slave trade.\r\n\r\nRecent legislation on the part of the New York State Board of Pharmacy\r\nwill tend to decrease the profit, as it requires that a poison label be\r\nput on each bottle of the product, as has long been the law in England.\r\n\r\nAn Omaha physician reports a case of poisoning from a compound bearing\r\nthe touching name of \"Kopp's Baby Friend,\" which has a considerable\r\nsale in the middle west and in central New York. It is made of sweetened\r\nwater and morphin, about one-third grain of morphin to the ounce.\r\n\r\n\"The child (after taking four drops) went into a stupor at once, the\r\npupils were pin-pointed, skin cool and clammy, heart and respiration\r\nslow. I treated the case as one of opium poisoning, but it took twelve\r\nhours before my little patient was out of danger.\"\r\n\r\nAs if to put a point of satirical grimness on the matter, the\r\nresponsible proprietor of this particular business of drugging helpless\r\nbabies is a woman, Mrs. J. A. Kopp, of York, Pa.\r\n\r\nMaking cocain fiends is another profitable enterprise. Catarrh powders\r\nare the medium. A decent druggist will not sell cocain as such,\r\nsteadily, to any customer, except on prescription, but most druggists\r\nfind salve for their consciences in the fact that the subtle and\r\nterrible drug is in the form of somebody's sure cure. There is need to\r\nsay nothing of the effects of cocain other than that it is destructive\r\nto mind and body alike, and appalling in its breaking down of all\r\nmoral restraint. Yet in New York City it is distributed in \"samples\"\r\nat ferries and railway stations. You may see the empty boxes and the\r\ninstructive labels littering the gutters of Broadway any Saturday night,\r\nwhen the drug-store trade is briskest.\r\n\r\nSimey's Catarrhal Powder, Dr. Cole's Catarrh Cure, Dr. Gray's Catarrh\r\nPowder and Crown Catarrh Powder are the ones most in demand. All of\r\nthem are cocain; the other ingredients are unimportant--perhaps even\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nWhether or not the bottles are labeled with the amount of cocain makes\r\nlittle difference. The habitués know. In one respect, however, the\r\nlabels help them by giving information as to which nostrum is the most\r\nheavily drugged.\r\n\r\n\"People come in here,\" a New York City druggist tells me, \"ask what\r\ncatarrh powders we've got, read the labels and pick out the one that's\r\ngot the most cocain. When I see a customer comparing labels I know she's\r\na fiend.\" {043}\r\n\r\nNaturally these owners and exploiters of these mixtures claim that the\r\nsmall amount of cocain contained is harmless. For instance, the \"Crown\r\nCure,\" admitting 2% per cent., says:\r\n\r\n\"Of course, this is a very small and harmless amount. Cocain is now\r\nconsidered to be the most valuable addition to modern medicine... it is\r\nthe most perfect relief known.\"\r\n\r\nBirney's Catarrh Cure runs as high as 4 per cent, and can produce\r\ntestimonials vouching for its harmlessness. Here is a Birney\r\n\"testimonial\" to the opposite effect, obtained \"without solicitation\r\nor payment\" (I have ventured to put it in the approved form), which no\r\nsufferer from catarrh can afford to miss. [IMAGE ==>] {043}\r\n\r\nREAD what William Thompson, of Chicago, says of\r\n\r\nBIRNEY'S CATARRH CURE.\r\n\r\n\"Three years ago Thompson was a strong man. Now he is without money,\r\nhealth, home or friends.\"\r\n\r\n(Chicago Tribune.)\r\n\r\n\"I began taking Birney's Catarrh Cure (says Thompson) three years ago,\r\nand the longing for the drug has grown so potent that I suffer without\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"I followed the directions at first, then I increased the quantity until\r\nI bought the stuff by the dozen bottles.\"\r\n\r\nA famous drink and drug cure in Illinois had, as a patient, not long\r\nago, a 14-year-old boy, who was a slave to the Birney brand of cocain.\r\nHe had run his father $300 in debt, so heavy were his purchases of the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\nChicago long ago settled this cocain matter in the only logical way. The\r\nproprietor of a large downtown drug store noticed several years ago\r\nthat at noon numbers of the shop girls from a great department store\r\npurchased certain catarrh powders over his counter. He had his clerk\r\nwarn them that the powders contained deleterious drugs. The girls\r\ncontinued to purchase in increasing numbers and quantity. He sent word\r\nto the superintendent of the store. \"That accounts for the number of our\r\ngirls that have gone wrong of late,\" was the superintendent's comment.\r\nThe druggist, Mr. McConnell, had an analysis made by the Board of\r\nHealth, which showed that the powder most called for was nearly 4 per\r\ncent, cocain, whereon he threw it and similar powders out of stock. The\r\ngirls went elsewhere. Mr. McConnell traced them and started a general\r\nmovement against this class of remedies, which resulted in an ordinance\r\nforbidding their sale. Birney's Catarrhal Powders, as I am informed, to\r\nmeet the new conditions brought-out a powder without cocain, which had\r\nthe briefest kind of a sale. For weeks thereafter the downtown stores\r\nwere haunted by haggard young men and women, who begged for \"the old\r\npowders; these new ones don't do any good.\" As high as $1.00 premium was\r\npaid for the 4 per cent, cocain species. To-day the Illinois druggist\r\nwho sells cocain in this form is liable to arrest. Yet in New York,\r\nat the corner of Forty-second street and Broadway, I saw recently a\r\nshow-window display of the Birney cure, and similar displays are not\r\nuncommon in other cities.\r\n\r\nRegarding other forms of drugs there may be honest differences of\r\nopinion as to the limits of legitimacy in the trade. If mendacious\r\nadvertising were stopped, and the actual ingredients of every nostrum\r\nplainly published {044}and frankly explained, the patent medicine trade\r\nmight reasonably claim to be a legitimate enterprise in many of its\r\nphases. But no label of opium or cocain, though the warning skull and\r\ncross-bones cover the bottle, will excuse the sale of products that are\r\nnever safely used except by expert advice. I believe that the Chicago\r\nmethod of dealing with the catarrh powders is the right method in\r\ncocain- and opium-bearing nostrums. Restrict the drug by the same\r\nsafeguards when sold under a lying pretence as when it flies its true\r\ncolors. Then, and then only, will our laws prevent the shameful trade\r\nthat stupefies helpless babies and makes criminals of our young men and\r\nharlots of our young women.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--PREYING ON THE INCURABLES.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Jan. 13, 1906. {045}\r\n\r\nIncurable disease is one of the strongholds of the patent medicine\r\nbusiness. The ideal patron, viewed in the light of profitable business,\r\nis the victim of some slow and wasting ailment in which recurrent hope\r\ninspires to repeated experiments with any \"cure\" that offers. In\r\nthe columns of almost every newspaper you may find promises to cure\r\nconsumption. Consumption is a disease absolutely incurable by any\r\nmedicine, although an increasing percentage of consumptives are saved by\r\nopen air, diet and methodical living. This is thoroughly and definitely\r\nunderstood by all medical and scientific men. Nevertheless there are in\r\nthe patent medicine world a set of harpies who, for their own business\r\ninterests, deliberately foster in the mind of the unfortunate sufferer\r\nfrom tuberculosis the belief that he can be saved by the use of some\r\nabsolutely fraudulent nostrum. Many of these consumption cures contain\r\ndrugs which hasten the progress of the disease, such as chloroform,\r\nopium, alcohol and hasheesh. Others are comparatively harmless in\r\nthemselves, but for their fervent promises of rescue they delude the\r\nsufferer into misplacing his reliance, and forfeiting his only chance by\r\nneglecting those rigidly careful habits of life which alone can conquer\r\nthe \"white plague.\" One and all, the men who advertise medicines to cure\r\nconsumption deliberately traffic in human life.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {045}\r\n\r\nCertain members of the Proprietary Association of America (the patent\r\nmedicine \"combine\") with whom I have talked have urged on me the claim\r\nthat there are firms in the nostrum business that are above criticism,\r\nand have mentioned H. E. Bucklen & Co., of Chicago, who manufacture a\r\ncertain salve. The Bucklen salve did not particularly interest me.\r\nBut when I came to take up the subject of consumption cures I ran\r\nunexpectedly on an interesting trail. In the country and small city\r\nnewspapers there is now being advertised lavishly \"Dr. King's New\r\nDiscovery for Consumption.\" It is proclaimed to be the \"only sure cure\r\nfor consumption.\" Further announcement is made that \"it strikes terror\r\nto the doctors.\" As it is a morphin and chloroform mixture, \"Dr. King's\r\nNew Discovery for Consumption\" is well calculated to strike terror to\r\nthe doctors or to any other class or profession, except, perhaps, the\r\nundertakers. It is a pretty diabolical concoction to give to any one,\r\nand particularly to a consumptive. The chloroform temporarily allays\r\nthe cough, thereby checking Nature's effort to throw off the dead\r\nmatter from the lungs. The opium drugs the patient into a deceived\r\ncheerfulness. The combination is admirably designed to shorten the life\r\nof any consumptive who takes it steadily. Of course, there is nothing on\r\nthe label of the bottle to warn the purchaser. That would be an example\r\nof legitimate advertising in the consumption field.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {046}\r\n\r\nA TYPICAL FRAUD.\r\n\r\nChloroform and Prussic Acid. {047}\r\n\r\nAnother \"cure\" which, for excellent reasons of its own, does not print\r\nits formula, is \"Shiloh's Consumption Cure,\" made at Leroy, N. Y., by\r\nS. C. Wells & Co. Were it to publish abroad the fact that it contains,\r\namong other ingredients, chloroform and prussic acid. Under our present\r\nlax system there is no warning on the bottle that the liquid contains\r\none of the most deadly of poisons. The makers write me: \"After you have\r\ntaken the medicine for awhile, if you are not firmly convinced that you\r\nare very much better we want you to go to your druggist and get back all\r\nthe money that you have paid for Shiloh.\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {047}\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {048}\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {049}\r\n\r\nBut if I were a consumptive, after I had taken \"Shiloh\" for awhile I\r\nshould be less interested in recovering my money than in getting back my\r\nwasted chance of life. Would S. C. Wells & Co. guarantee that? {050}\r\n\r\nMorphin is the important ingredient of Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup.\r\nNevertheless, the United States Postoffice Department obligingly\r\ntransmits me a dose of this poison through the mails from A. C. Meyer\r\n& Co., of Baltimore, the makers. The firm writes me, in response to my\r\nletter of inquiry:\r\n\r\n\"We do not claim that Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup will cure an established\r\ncase of consumption. If you have gotten this impression you most likely\r\nhave misunderstood what we claim.... We can, however, say that Dr.\r\nBull's Cough Syrup has cured cases said to have been consumption in its\r\nearliest stages.\"\r\n\r\nQuite conservative, this. But A. C. Meyer & Co. evidently don't follow\r\ntheir own advertising very closely, for around my sample bottle (by\r\ncourtesy of the Postoffice Department) is a booklet, and from that\r\nbooklet I quote:\r\n\r\n\"_There is no case of hoarseness, cough, asthma, bronchitis... or\r\nconsumption that can not be cured speedily by the proper use of Dr.\r\nBull's Cough Syrup_.\"\r\n\r\nIf this is not a claim that Dr. Bull's Cough Syrup \"will cure an\r\nestablished case of consumption,\" what is it? The inference from Meyer\r\n& Co.'s cautious letter is that they realize their responsibility for a\r\ncruel and dangerous fraud and are beginning to feel an uneasiness\r\nabout it, which may be shame or may be only fear. One logical effect\r\nof permitting medicines containing a dangerous quantity of poison to\r\nbe sold without the poison label is shown in the coroner's verdict\r\nreproduced on page 47.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {047}\r\n\r\nIn the account of the Keck baby's death from the Dr. Bull opium mixture,\r\nwhich the Cincinnati papers published, there was no mention of the\r\nname of the cough syrup. Asked about this, the newspapers gave various\r\nexplanations. Two of them disclosed that they had no information on the\r\npoint. This is contrary to the statement of the physician in the case,\r\nand implies a reportorial, laxity which is difficult to credit. One\r\nascribed the omission to a settled policy and one to the fear of libel.\r\nWhen the coroner's verdict was given out, however, the name of the\r\nnostrum got into plain print. On the whole, the Cincinnati papers showed\r\nthemselves gratifyingly independent.\r\n\r\nAnother case of poisoning from this same remedy occurred in Morocco,\r\nInd., the victim being a 2-year-old child. The doctor reports:\r\n\r\n\"In an hour, when first seen, symptoms of opium poisoning were present.\r\nIn about twelve hours the child had several convulsions, and spasms\r\nfollowed for another twelve hours at intervals. It then sank into a coma\r\nand died in the seventy-two hours with cardiac failure. The case was\r\nclearly one of death from overdose of the remedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe baby had swallowed a large amount of the \"medicine\" from a bottle\r\nleft within its reach. Had the bottle been properly labeled with skull\r\nand cross-bones the mother would probably not have let it lie about.\r\n\r\nCaution seems to have become a suddenly acquired policy of this class\r\nof medicines, in so far as their correspondence goes. Unfortunately,\r\nit does not extend to their advertising. The result is a rather painful\r\ndiscrepancy. G. G. Green runs hotels in California and manufactures\r\nquack medicines in Woodbury, N. J., one of these being \"Boschee's German\r\nSyrup,\" a \"consumption cure.\" Mr. Green writes me (per rubber stamp):\r\n\r\n\"Consumption can sometimes be cured, but not always. Some cases are\r\nbeyond cure. However, we suggest that you secure a trial bottle of\r\nGerman Syrup for 25 cents,\" etc.\r\n\r\nOn the bottle I read: \"Certain cure for all diseases of the throat and\r\nlungs.\" Consumption is a disease of the lungs; sometimes of the throat.\r\n{051}\r\n\r\nIf it \"can sometimes be cured, but not always,\" then the German Syrup\r\nis not a \"certain cure for all diseases of the throat and lungs,\" and\r\nsomebody, as the ill-fated Reingelder put it, \"haf lied in brint\" on\r\nMr. Green's bottle, which must be very painful to Mr. Green. Mr. Green's\r\nremedy contains morphin and some hydrocyanic acid. Therefore consumption\r\nwill be much less often curable where Boschee's German Syrup is used\r\nthan where it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolutely False Claims.\r\n\r\nA curious mixture of the cautious, semi-ethical method and the blatant\r\nclaim-all patent medicine is offered in the Ozomulsion Company.\r\nOzomulsion does not, like the \"cures\" mentioned above, contain active\r\npoisons. It is one of the numerous cod-liver oil preparations, and its\r\nadvertising, in tne medical journals at first and now in the lay\r\npress, is that of a cure for consumption. I visited the offices of the\r\nOzomulsion Company recently and found them duly furnished with a regular\r\nphysician, who was employed, so he informed me, in a purely ethical\r\ncapacity. There was also present during the interview the president\r\nof the Ozomulsion Company, Mr. A. Frank Richardson, former advertising\r\nagent, former deviser of the advertising of Swamp-Root, former\r\nproprietor of Kranitonic and present proprietor of Slocum's Consumption\r\nCure, which is the \"wicked partner\" of Ozomulsion. For convenience I\r\nwill put the conversation in court report form, and, indeed, it partook\r\nsomewhat of the nature of a cross-examination:\r\n\r\nQ.--Dr. Smith, will Ozomulsion cure consumption?\r\n\r\nA.--Ozomulsion builds up the tissues, imparts vigor, aids the natural\r\nresistance of the body, etc. (Goes into a long exploitation in the\r\nmanner and style made familiar by patent medicine pamphlets. )\r\n\r\nQ.--But will it cure consumption?\r\n\r\nA.--Well, without saying that it is a specific, etc. (Passes to an\r\ninstructive, entertaining and valuable disquisition on the symptoms and\r\nnature of tuberculosis. )\r\n\r\nQ.--Yes, but will Ozomulsion cure consumption?\r\n\r\nA.--We don't claim that it will cure consumption.\r\n\r\nQ.--Does not this advertisement state that Ozomulsion will cure\r\nconsumption? (SHowing advertisement.)\r\n\r\nA.--It seems to.\r\n\r\nQ.--Will Ozomulsion cure consumption?\r\n\r\nA.--In the early stages of the disease--\r\n\r\nQ. (interrupting)--Does the advertisement make any qualifications as to\r\nthe stage of tne disease?\r\n\r\nA.--Not that I find.\r\n\r\nQ.--Have you ever seen that advertisement before?\r\n\r\nA.--Not to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nQ.--Who wrote it?\r\n\r\nA. (by President Richardson)--I done that ad. myself.\r\n\r\nQ.--Mr. Richardson, will Ozomulsion cure consumption?\r\n\r\nA.--Sure; we got testimonials to prove it.\r\n\r\nQ.--Have you ever investigated any of these testimonials?\r\n\r\nQ. (to Dr. Smith)--Dr. Smith, in view of the direct statement of your\r\nadvertising, do you believe that Ozomulsion will cure consumption?\r\n\r\nA.--Well, I believe in a great many cases it will.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHealth for Five Dollars.\r\n\r\nThat is as far as Dr. Smith would go. I wonder what he would have said\r\nas to the Dr. T. A. Slocum side of the business. Dr. Slocum puts out a\r\n\"Special Cure Offer\" that will snatch you from the jaws of death, on the\r\n{052}blanket plan, for $6, and guarantees the cure (or more medicine) for\r\n$10. His scheme is so noble and broad-minded that I can not refrain from\r\ndetailing it. For $5 you get,\r\n\r\n     1 large bottle of Psychine,\r\n     1 large bottle of Ozomulsion,\r\n     1 large bottle of Coltsfoote Expectorant,\r\n     1 large tube of Ozojell,\r\n     3 boxes of lazy Liver Pills\r\n     3 Hot X-Ray Porous Plaster,\r\n\r\n\"which,\" says the certificate, \"will in a majority of cases effect a\r\npermanent care of the malady from which the invalid is now suffering.\"\r\nWhatever ails you--that's what Dr. T. A. Sloram cures. For $10 you get\r\nalmost twice the amount, plus the guarantee. Surely there is little left\r\non earth, unless Dr. Slocum should issue a $15 offer, to include funeral\r\nexpenses and a tombstone.\r\n\r\nThe Slocum Consumption Cure proper consists of a gay-hued substance\r\nknown as \"Psychine.\" Psychine is about 16 per cent, alcohol, and has a\r\ndash of strychnin to give the patient his money's worth. Its alluring\r\ncolor is derived from cochineal. It is \"an infallible and unfailing\r\nremedy for consumption.\" Ozomulsion is also a sure cure, if the\r\nliterature is to be believed. To cure one's self twice of the same\r\ndisease savors of reckless extravagance, but as \"a perfect and permanent\r\ncure will be the inevitable consequence,\" perhaps it's worth the money.\r\nIt would not do to charge Dr. T. A. Slocum with fraud, because he is,\r\nI suppose, as dead as Lydia E. Pinkham; but Mr. A. Frank Richardson is\r\nvery much alive, and I trust it will be no surprise to him to see here\r\nstated that his Ozomulsion makes claims that it can not support, that\r\nhis Psychine is considerably worse, that his special cure offer is a bit\r\nof shameful quackery, and that his whole Slocum Consumption Cure is a\r\nfake and a fraud so ludicrous that its continued insistence is a\r\nbrilliant commentary on human credulousness.\r\n\r\nSince the early '60s, and perhaps before, there has constantly been in\r\nthe public prints one or another benefactor of the human race who wishes\r\nto bestow on suffering mankind, free of charge, a remedy which has\r\nsnatched him from the brink of the grave. Such a one is Mr. W. A.\r\nNoyes, of Rochester, N. Y. To any one who writes him he sends gratis\r\na prescription which will surely cure consumption. But take this\r\nprescription to your druggist and you will fail to get it filled,\r\nfor the simple reason that the ingenious Mr. Noyes has employed a\r\npharmaceutical nomenclature peculiarly his own If you wish to try the\r\n\"Cannabis Sativa Remedy\" (which is a mixture of hasheesh and other\r\ndrugs) you must purchase it direct from the advertiser at a price which\r\nassures him an abnormal profit. As Mr. Noyes writes me proposing to give\r\nspecial treatment for my (supposed) case, depending on a diagnosis of\r\nsixty-seven questions, I fail to see why he is not liable for practicing\r\nmedicine without a license.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiso Grows Cautious.\r\n\r\nPiso's Consumption Cure, extensively advertised a year or two ago, is\r\napparently withdrawing from the field, so far as consumption goes,\r\nand the Pino people are now more modestly promising to cure coughs and\r\ncolds. Old analyses give as the contents of Piso's Cure for Consumption\r\nalcohol, chloroform, opium and cannabis indica (hasheesh). In reply\r\nto an inquiry as to whether their remedy contains morphin and cannabis\r\nindica, the Piso Company replies: \"Since the year 1872 Piso's Cure has\r\ncontained no morphin or anything derived from opium.\" The question as to\r\ncannabis indica is not answered. Analysis shows that the \"cure\" contains\r\nchloroform, alcohol and apparently cannabis indica. It is, therefore,\r\nanother of the {053}remedies which can not possibly cure consumption,\r\nbut, on the contrary, tend by their poisonous and debilitating drugs to\r\nundermine the victim's stamina.\r\n\r\nPeruna, Liquozone, Duffy's Malt Whiskey, Pierce's Golden Medical\r\nDiscovery and the other \"blanket\" cures include tuberculosis in their\r\nlists, claiming great numbers of well-authenticated cures. From the\r\nimposing book published by the R. V. Pierce Company, of Buffalo, I took\r\na number of testimonials for investigation; not a large number, for I\r\nfound the consumption testimonial rather scarce. From fifteen letters I\r\ngot results in nine cases. Seven of the letters were returned to me\r\nmarked \"unclaimed,\" of which one was marked \"Name not in the dictory,\"\r\nanother \"No such postoffice in the state\" and a third \"Deceased.\" The\r\neighth man wrote that the Golden Medical Discovery had cured his cough\r\nand blood-spitting, adding: \"It is the best lung medisan I ever used for\r\nlung trubble.\" The last man said he took twenty-five bottles and was\r\ncured! Two out of nine seems to me a suspiciously small percentage of\r\ntraceable recoveries. Much stress has been laid by the Proprietary\r\nAssociation of America through its press committee on the suit brought\r\nby R. V. Pierce against the Ladies' Home Journal, the implication being\r\n(although the suit has not yet been tried) that a reckless libeler of a\r\nnoble and worthy business has been suitably punished. In the full\r\nappreciation of Dr. Pierce's attitude in the matter of libel, I wish to\r\nstate that in so far as its claim of curing consumption is concerned his\r\nGolden Medical Discovery is an unqualified fraud.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {053}\r\n\r\nOne might suppose that the quacks would stop short of trying to deceive\r\nthe medical profession in this matter, yet the \"consumption cure\" may\r\nbe found disporting itself in the pages of the medical journals. For\r\ninstance, I find this advertisement in several professional magazines:\r\n\r\n\"McArthur's Syrup of Hypophosphites has proved itself, time and time\r\nagain, to be positively beneficial in this condition [tuberculosis]\r\nin the hands of prominent observers, clinicians and, what is more,\r\npracticing physicians, hundreds of whom have written their admiring\r\nencomiums in {054}its behalf, and it is the enthusiastic conviction of\r\nmany that _its effect is truly specific_\" Which, translated into lay\r\nterms, means that the syrup will cure consumption. I find also in the\r\nmedical press \"a sure cure for dropsy,\" fortified with a picture worthy\r\nof Swamp-Root or Lydia Pinkham. Both of these are frauds in attempting\r\nto foster the idea that they will _cure_ the diseases, and they are\r\nnone the less fraudulent for being advertised to the medical profession\r\ninstead of to the laity.\r\n\r\nIs there, then, no legitimate advertising of preparations useful in\r\ndiseases such as tuberculosis? Very little, and that little mostly in\r\nthe medical journals, exploiting products which tend to build up and\r\nstrengthen the patient. There has recently appeared, however, one\r\nadvertisement in the lay press which seems to me a legitimate attempt\r\nto push a nostrum. It is reproduced at the beginning of this article.\r\nNotice, first, the frank statement that there is no specific for\r\nconsumption; second, that there is no attempt to deceive the public into\r\nthe belief that the emulsion will be helpful in all cases. Whether or\r\nnot Scott's Emulsion is superior to other cod-liver oils is beside the\r\npresent question. If all patent medicine \"copy\" were written in the same\r\nspirit of honesty as this, I should have been able to omit from this\r\nseries all consideration of fraud, and devote my entire attention to the\r\nfar less involved and difficult matter of poison. Unhappily, all of\r\nthe Scott's Emulsion advertising is not up to this standard. In another\r\nnewspaper I have seen an excerpt in which the Scott & Bowne Company come\r\nperilously near making, if they do not actually make, the claim that\r\ntheir emulsion is a cure, and furthermore make themselves ridiculous by\r\nchallenging comparison with another emulsion, suggesting a chemical test\r\nand offering, if their nostrum comes out second best, _to give to the\r\ninstitution making the experiment a supply of their oil free for a\r\nyear_. This is like the German druggist who invented a heart-cure and\r\noffered two cases to any one who could prove that it was injurious!\r\n\r\nConsumption is not the only incurable disease in which there are good\r\npickings for the birds of prey. In a recent issue of the New York Sunday\r\n_American-Journal_ I find three cancer cures, one dropsy cure, one\r\n\"heart-disease soon cured,\" three epilepsy cures and a \"case of\r\nparalysis cured.\" Cancer yields to but one agency--the knife. Epilepsy\r\nis either the result of pressure on the brain or some obscure cerebral\r\ndisease; medicine can never cure it. Heart disease is of many kinds, and\r\na drug that may be helpful in relieving symptoms in one case might be\r\nfatal in another. The same is true of dropsy. Medical science knows no\r\n\"cure\" for paralysis. As space lacks to consider individually the nature\r\nof each nostrum separately, I list briefly, for the protection of those\r\nwho read, a number of the more conspicuous swindles of this kind now\r\nbeing foisted on the public:\r\n\r\n     Rupert Wells' Radiatized Fluid, for cancer.\r\n     Miles' Heart Disease Cure.\r\n     Miles' Grand Dropsy Cure.\r\n     Dr. Tucker's Epilepsy Cure.\r\n     Dr. Grant's Epilepsy Cure.\r\n     W. H. May's Epilepsy Cure.\r\n     Dr. Kline's Epilepsy Cure.\r\n     Dr. W. 0. Bye's Cancer Cure.\r\n     Mason's Cancer Cure.\r\n     Dr. Williams' Pink Pills for Pale People,\r\n\r\nwhich are advertised to cure paralysis and are a compound of green\r\nvitriol, starch and sugar.\r\n\r\nPurchasers of these nostrums not only waste their money, but in many\r\ncases they throw away their only chance by delaying proper treatment\r\nuntil it is too late. {055}\r\n\r\nProperly, a \"cure\" known as Bioplasm belongs in this list, but so\r\ningenious are its methods that it deserves some special attention. In\r\nsome of the New York papers a brief advertisement, reading as follows,\r\noccupies a conspicuous position.\r\n\r\n\"After suffering for ten years the torture that only an ataxic can know,\r\nMr. E. P. Burnham, of Delmar, N. Y., has been relieved of all pain and\r\nrestored to health and strength, and the ability to resume his usual\r\npursuits, by an easily obtained and inexpensive treatment which\r\nany druggist can furnish. To any fellow-sufferer who mails him a\r\nself-addressed envelope Mr. Burnham sends free this prescription which\r\ncured him.\"--Adv.\r\n\r\nNow, people who give away something for nothing, and spend money\r\nadvertising for a chance to do it, are as rare in the patent medicine\r\nbusiness as out of it, and Delmar, N. Y., is not included in any map of\r\nAltruria that I have learned of E. P. Burnham, therefore, seemed worth\r\nwriting to. The answer came back promptly, inclosing the prescription\r\nand explaining the advertiser's purpose:\r\n\r\n\"My only motive in the notice which caught your attention is to help\r\nother sufferers. _You owe me nothing. I have nothing to sell_. When\r\nyou are benefited, however, if you feel disposed and able to send me\r\na contribution to assist me in making this great boon to our\r\nfelow-sufferers better known it will be thankfully received and used for\r\nthat purpose.\"\r\n\r\nI fear that Mr. Burnham doesn't make much money out of grateful\r\ncorrespondents who were cured of locomotor ataxia by his prescription,\r\nbecause locomotor ataxia is absolutely and hopelessly incurable. Where\r\nMr. Burnham gets his reward, I fancy, is from the Bioplasm Company, of\r\n100 William street, New York, whose patent medicine is prescribed for\r\nme. I should like to believe that his \"only motive is to help other\r\nsufferers,\" but as I find, on investigation, that the advertising agents\r\nwho handle the \"Burnham\" account are the Bioplasm Company's agents, I am\r\nregretfully compelled to believe that Mr. Burnham, instead of being of\r\nthe tribe of the good Samaritan, is probably an immediate relative of\r\nAnanias. The Bioplasm Company also proposes to cure consumption, and is\r\nworthy of a conspicuous place in the Fraud's Gallery of Nostrums.\r\n\r\nEven the skin of the Ethiop is not exempt from the attention of the\r\nquacks. A colored correspondent writes, asking that I \"give a paragraph\r\nto these frauds who cater to the vanity of those of my race who insult\r\ntheir Creator in attempting to change their color and hair,\" and inclose\r\na typical advertisement of \"Lustorene,\" which \"straightens kinky, nappy,\r\ncurly hair,\" and of \"Lustorone Face Bleach,\" which \"whitens the darkest\r\nskin\" and will \"bring the skin to any desired shade or color.\" Nothing\r\ncould better illustrate to what ridiculous lengths the nostrum fraud\r\nwill go. Of course, the Lustorone business is fraudulent. Some time\r\nsince a Virginia concern, which advertised to turn negroes white, was\r\nsuppressed by the Postoffice Department, which might well turn its\r\nattention to Lustorone Face Bleach.\r\n\r\nThere are being exploited in this country to-day more than 100 cures,\r\nfor diseases that are absolutely beyond the reach of drugs. They\r\nare owned by men who know them to be swindles, and who in private\r\nconversation will almost always evade the direct statement that their\r\nnostrums will \"cure\" consumption, epilepsy, heart disease and ailments\r\nof that nature. Many of them \"guarantee\" their remedies. They will\r\nreturn your money if you aren't satisfied. And they can afford to. They\r\ntake the lightest of risks. The real risk is all on the other side.\r\nIt is their few pennies per bottle against your life. Were the facile\r\npatter by which they lure to the bargain a menace to the pocketbook\r\nalone, one might regard them only as ordinary {056}followers of light\r\nfinance, might imagine them filching their gain with the confidential,\r\nhalf-brazen, half-ashamed leer of the thimblerigger. But the matter\r\ngoes further and deeper. Every man who trades in this market, whether he\r\npockets the profits of the maker, the purveyor or the advertiser, takes\r\ntoll of blood. He may not deceive himself here, for here the patent\r\nmedicine is nakedest, most cold-hearted. Relentless greed sets the trap\r\nand death is partner in the enterprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI--THE FUNDAMENTAL FAKES.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Feb. 17, 1906. {057}\r\n\r\nAdvertising and testimonials are respectively the aggressive and\r\ndefensive forces of the Great American Fraud. Without the columns of the\r\nnewspapers and magazines wherein to exploit themselves, a great majority\r\nof the patent medicines would peacefully and blessedly fade out of\r\nexistence. Nearly all the world of publications is open to the swindler,\r\nthe exceptions being the high-class magazines and a very few independent\r\nspirited newspapers. The strongholds of the fraud are dailies, great\r\nand small, the cheap weeklies and the religious press. According to\r\nthe estimate of a prominent advertising firm, above 90 per cent, of\r\nthe earning capacity of the prominent nostrums is represented by their\r\nadvertising. And all this advertising is based on the well-proven\r\ntheory of the public's pitiable ignorance and gullibility in the vitally\r\nimportant matter of health.\r\n\r\nStudy the medicine advertising in your morning paper, and you will find\r\nyourself in a veritable goblin-realm of fakery, peopled with monstrous\r\nmyths. Here is an amulet in the form of an electric belt, warranted\r\nto restore youth and vigor to the senile; yonder a magic ring or a\r\nmysterious inhaler, or a bewitched foot-plaster which will draw the\r\npangs of rheumatism from the tortured body \"or your money back\"; and\r\nagain some beneficent wizard in St. Louis promises with a secret philtre\r\nto charm away deadly cancer, while in the next column a firm of magi\r\nin Denver proposes confidently to exorcise the demon of incurable\r\nconsumption without ever seeing the patient. Is it credible that a\r\nsupposedly civilized nation should accept such stuff as gospel? Yet\r\nthese exploitations cited above, while they are extreme, differ only\r\nin degree from nearly all patent-medicine advertising. Ponce de Leon,\r\ngroping toward that dim fountain whence youth springs eternal, might\r\nbelieve that he had found his goal in the Peruna factory, the Liquozone\r\n\"laboratory\" or the Vitæ-Ore plant; his thousands of descendants in\r\nthis century of enlightenment painfully drag themselves along poisoned\r\ntrails, following a will-o'-the-wisp that dances above the open graves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNewspaper Accomplices.\r\n\r\nIf there is no limit to the gullibility of the public on the one hand,\r\nthere is apparently none to the cupidity of the newspapers on the other.\r\nAs the Proprietary Association of America is constantly setting forth in\r\nveiled warnings, the press takes an enormous profit from patent-medicine\r\nadvertising. Mr. Hearst's papers alone reap a harvest of more than half\r\na million dollars per annum from this source. The Chicago _Tribune_,\r\nwhich treats nostrum advertising in a spirit of independence, and\r\nsometimes with scant courtesy, still receives more than $80,000 a year\r\nin medical patronage. Many of the lesser journals actually live on\r\npatent medicines. What wonder that they are considerate of these\r\nprofitable customers! Pin a newspaper owner down to the issue of fraud\r\nin the matter, and he will take refuge in the plea that his advertisers\r\nand not himself are responsible for what appears in the advertising\r\ncolumns. _Caveat emptor_ is the implied superscription above this\r\ndepartment. The more shame to those publications {058}which prostitute\r\ntheir news and editorial departments to their greed. Here are two\r\nsamples, one from the Cleveland _Plain-Dealer_, the other from a\r\ntemperance weekly, Green Goods \"Cable News.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"Ascatco\" advertisement, which the Plain-Dealer prints as a\r\ncablegram, without any distinguishing mark to designate it as an\r\nadvertisement, of course, emanates from the office of the nostrum, and\r\nis a fraud, as the _Plain-Dealer_ well knew when it accepted payment,\r\nand became partner to the swindle by deceiving its readers. Tne Vitæ-Ore\r\n\"editorial\" appears by virtue of a full-page advertisement of this\r\nextraordinary fake in the same issue.\r\n\r\nWhether, because church-going people are more trusting, and therefore\r\nmore easily befooled than others, or from some more obscure reason, many\r\nof the religious papers fairly reek with patent-medicine fakes.\r\nTake, for instance, the _Christian Endeavor World_, which is the\r\nundenominational organ of a large, powerful and useful organization,\r\nunselfishly working toward the betterment of society. A subscriber who\r\nrecently complained of certain advertisements received the following\r\nreply from the business manager of the publication:\r\n\r\n\"Dear Sir:--Your letter of the 4th comes to me for reply. Appreciating\r\nthe good spirit in which you write, let me assure you that, to the best\r\nof our knowledge and belief, we are not publishing any fraudulent\r\nor unworthy medicine advertising. We decline every year thousands of\r\ndollars' worth of patent-medicine advertising that we think is either\r\nfraudulent or misleading. You would be surprised, very likely, if you\r\ncould know of the people of high intelligence and good character who are\r\nbenefited by these {059}medicines. We have taken a great deal of pains\r\nto make particular inquiries of our subscribers with respect to this\r\nquestion, and a very large percentage of them are devoted to one or\r\nmore well-known patent medicines, and regard them as household remedies.\r\nTrusting that you will be able to understand that we are acting\r\naccording to our best and sincerest judgment, I remain, yours very\r\ntruly,\r\n\r\n\"The Golden Rule Company,\r\n\r\n\"George W. Coleman, Business Manager\"\r\n\r\nRunning through half a dozen recent issues of the _Christian Endeavor\r\nWorld_, I find nineteen medical advertisements of, at best, dubious\r\nnature. Assuming that the business management of the _Christian Endeavor\r\nWorld_ represents normal intelligence, I would like to ask whether it\r\naccepts the statement that a pair of \"magic foot drafts\" applied to the\r\nbottom of the feet will cure any and every kind of rheumatism in any\r\npart of the body? Further, if the advertising department is genuinely\r\ninterested in declining \"fraudulent or misleading\" copy, I would call\r\ntheir attention to the ridiculous claims of Dr. Shoop's medicines,\r\nwhich \"cure\" almost every disease; to two hair removers, one an \"Indian\r\nSecret,\" the other an \"accidental discovery,\" both either fakes or\r\ndangerous; to the lying claims of Hall's Catarrh Cure, that it is \"a\r\npositive cure for catarrh\" in all its stages to \"Syrup of Figs,\" which\r\nis not a fig syrup, but a preparation of senna; to Dr. Kilmer's Swamp\r\nRoot, of which the principal medicinal constituent is alcohol; and,\r\nfinally, to Dr. Bye's Oil Cure for cancer, a particularly cruel swindle\r\non unfortunates suffering from an incurable malady. All of these, with\r\nother matter, which for the sake of decency I do not care to detail\r\nin these columns, appear in recent issues of the _Christian Endeavor\r\nWorld_, and are respectfully submitted to its management and its\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQuackery and Religion.\r\n\r\nThe Baptist Watchman of Oct. 12, 1905, prints an editorial defending the\r\nprinciple of patent medicines. It would be interesting to know whether\r\nthe back page of the number has any connection with the editorial. This\r\npage is given up to an illustrated advertisement of Vito-Ore, one of\r\nthe boldest fakes in the whole Frauds' Gallery. Vitæ-Ore claims to be\r\na mineral mined from \"an extinct mineral spring,\" and to contain free\r\niron, free sulphur and free magnesium. It contains no free iron, no free\r\nsulphur, and no free magnesium. It announces itself as \"a certain and\r\nnever-failing cure\" for rheumatism and Bright's disease, dropsy,\r\nblood poisoning, nervous prostration and general debility, among other\r\nmaladies. Whether it is, as asserted, mined from an extinct spring\r\nor bucketed from a sewer has no bearing on its utterly fraudulent\r\ncharacter. There is no \"certain and never-failing cure\" for the diseases\r\nin its list, and when the _Baptist Watchman_ sells itself to such an\r\nexploitation it becomes partner to a swindle not only on the pockets\r\nof its readers, but on their health as well. In the same issue I find\r\n\"Piso's Cure for Consumption,\"\r\n\r\n\"Bye's Cancer Cure,\"\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. M. Summer's Female Remedy,\"\r\n\r\n\"Winslow's Soothing Syrup,\" and \"Juven Pills,\" somewhat disguised here,\r\nbut in other mediums openly a sexual weakness \"remedy.\"\r\n\r\nA correspondent sends me clippings from _The Christian Century_, leading\r\noff with an interesting editorial entitled \"Our Advertisers,\" from which\r\nI quote in part:\r\n\r\n\"We take pleasure in calling the attention of our readers to the high\r\ngrade of advertising which _The Christian Century_ commands. We shall\r\ncontinue to advertise only such companies as we know to be thoroughly\r\nreliable. During the past year we have refused thousands of dollars'\r\n{060}worth of advertising which other religious journals are running,\r\nbut which is rated 'objectionable' by the better class of periodicals.\r\nCompare our advertising columns with the columns of any other purely\r\nreligious journal, and let us know what you think of the character of\r\nour advertising patrons.\"\r\n\r\nWhether the opinion of a non-subscriber will interest _The Christian\r\nCentury_ I have no means of knowing, but I will venture it. My opinion\r\nis that a considerable proportion of its advertisements are such as any\r\nright-minded and intelligent publisher should be ashamed to print, and\r\nthat if its readers accept its endorsement of the advertising columns\r\nthey will have a very heavy indictment to bring against it. Three\r\n\"cancer cures,\" a dangerous \"heart cure,\" a charlatan eye doctor, Piso's\r\nConsumption Cure, Dr. Shoop's Rheumatism Cure and Liquozone make up\r\na pretty fair \"Frauds' Gallery\" for the delectation of _The Christian\r\nCentury's_ readers.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {060}\r\n\r\nAs a convincing argument, many nostrums guarantee, not a cure, as they\r\nwould have the public believe, but a reimbursement if the medicine is\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nLiquozone does this, and faithfully carries out its agreement.\r\nElectro-gen, a new \"germicide,\" which has stolen Liquozone's advertising\r\nscheme almost word for word, also promises this. Dr. Shoop's agreement\r\n{061}is so worded that the unsatisfied customer is likely to have\r\nconsiderable trouble in getting his money back. Other concerns send\r\ntheir \"remedies\" free on trial, among these being the ludicrous \"magic\r\nfoot drafts\" referred to above. At first thought it would seem that\r\nonly a cure would bring profit to the makers. But the fact is that most\r\ndiseases tend to cure themselves by natural means, and the delighted and\r\ndeluded patient, ascribing the relief to the \"remedy,\" which really has\r\nnothing to do with it, sends on his grateful dollar. Where the money\r\nis already paid, most people are too inert to undertake the effort of\r\ngetting it back. It is the easy American way of accepting a swindle as a\r\nsort of joke, which makes for the nostrum readers ready profits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSafe Rewards.\r\n\r\nThen there is the \"reward for proof\" that the proprietary will not\r\nperform the wonders advertised. The Liquozone Company offer $1,000, I\r\nbelieve, for any germ that Liquozone will not kill. This is a pretty\r\nsafe offer, because there are no restrictions as to the manner in which\r\nthe unfortunate germ might be maltreated. If the matter came to an\r\nissue, the defendants might put their bacillus in the Liquozone bottle\r\nand freeze him solid. If that didn't end him, they could boil the ice\r\nand save their money, as thus far no germ has been discovered which\r\ncan survive the process of being made into soup. Nearly all of the\r\nHall Catarrh Cure advertisements offer a reward of $100 for any case\r\nof catarrh which the nostrum fails to cure. It isn't enough, though one\r\nhundred times that amount might be worth while; for who doubts that Mr.\r\nF. J. Cheney, inventor of the \"red clause,\" would fight for his cure\r\nthrough every court, exhausting the prospective $100 reward of his\r\nopponent in the first round? How hollow the \"guarantee\" pretence is, is\r\nshown by a clever scheme devised by Radam, the quack, years ago, when\r\nShreveport was stricken with yellow fever. Knowing that his offer could\r\nnot be accepted, he proposed to the United States Government that he\r\nshould eradicate the epidemic by destroying all the germs with Radam's\r\nMicrobe Killer, offering to deposit $10,000 as a guarantee. Of course,\r\nthe Government declined on the ground that it had no power to accept\r\nsuch an offer. Meantime, Radam got a lot of free advertising, and his\r\nfortune was made.\r\n\r\nNo little stress is laid on \"personal advice\" by the patent-medicine\r\ncompanies. This may be, according to the statements of the firm, from\r\ntheir physician or from some special expert. As a matter of fact, it is\r\nalmost invariably furnished by a $10-a-week typewriter, following\r\nout one of a number of \"form\" letters prepared in bulk for the\r\n\"personal-inquiry\" dupes. Such is the Lydia E. Pinkham method. The\r\nPinkham Company writes me that it is entirely innocent of any intent to\r\ndeceive people into believing that Lydia E. Pinkham is still alive, and\r\nthat it has published in several cases statements regarding her demise.\r\nIt is true that a number of years ago a newspaper forced the Pinkham\r\nconcern into a defensive admission of Lydia E. Pinkham's death, but\r\nsince then the main purpose of the Pinkham advertising has been to\r\nbefool the feminine public into believing that their letters go to a\r\nwoman--who died nearly twenty years ago of one of the diseases, it is\r\nsaid, which her remedy claims to cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Immortal Mrs. Pinkham.\r\n\r\nTrue, the newspaper appeal is always \"Write to Mrs. Pinkham,\" and this\r\nis technically a saving clause, as there is a Mrs. Pinkham, widow of the\r\nson of Lydia E. Pinkham. What sense of shame she might be supposed to\r\nsuffer in the perpetration of an obvious and public fraud is presumably\r\n{062}salved by the large profits of the business. The great majority\r\nof the gulls who \"write to Mrs. Pinkham\" suppose themselves to be\r\naddressing Lydia E. Pinkham, and their letters are not even answered by\r\nthe present proprietor of the name, but by a corps of hurried clerks and\r\ntypewriters.\r\n\r\nYou get the same result when you write to Dr. Hartman, of Peruna, for\r\npersonal guidance. Dr. Hartman himself told me that he took no active\r\npart now in the conduct of the Peruna Company. If he sees the letters\r\naddressed to him at all, it is by chance. \"Dr. Kilmer,\" of Swamp-Root\r\nfame, wants you to write to him about your kidneys. There is no Dr.\r\nKilmer in the Swamp-Root concern, and has not been for many years. Dr.\r\nT. A. Slocum, who writes you so earnestly and piously about taking care\r\nof your consumption in time, is a myth. The whole \"personal medical\r\nadvice\" business is managed by rote, and the letter that you get\r\n\"special to your case\" has been printed and signed before your inquiry\r\never reached the shark who gets your money.\r\n\r\nAn increasingly common pitfall is the letter in the newspapers from some\r\nsufferer who has been saved from disease and wants you to write and get\r\nthe prescription free. A conspicuous instance of this is \"A Notre\r\nDame Lady's Appeal\" to sufferers from rheumatism and also from female\r\ntrouble. \"Mrs. Summers,\" of Notre Dame, Ill., whose picture in the\r\npapers represents a fat Sister of Charity, with the wan, uneasy\r\nexpression of one who feels that her dinner isn't digesting properly,\r\nmay be a real lady, but I suspect she wears a full beard and talks in\r\na bass voice, because my letter of inquiry to her was answered by the\r\npatent medicine firm of Vanderhoof & Co., who inclosed some sample\r\ntablets and wanted to sell me more. There are many others of this class.\r\nIt is safe to assume that every advertising altruist who pretends to\r\ngive out free prescriptions is really a quack medicine firm in disguise.\r\n\r\nOne more instance of bad faith to which the nostrum patron renders\r\nhimself liable: It is asserted that these letters of inquiry in the\r\npatent medicine field are regarded as private. \"All correspondence\r\nheld strictly private and sacredly confidential,\" advertises Dr. R. V.\r\nPierce, of the Golden Medical Discovery, etc. A Chicago firm of letter\r\nbrokers offers to send me 50,000 Dr. Pierce order blanks at $2 a\r\nthousand for thirty days; or I can get terms on Ozomulsion, Theodore\r\nNoel (Vitæ-Ore), Dr. Stevens' Nervous Debility Cure, Cactus Cure,\r\nwomen's regulators, etc.\r\n\r\nWith advertisements in the medical journals the public is concerned only\r\nindirectly, it is true, but none the less vitally. Only doctors read\r\nthese exploitations, but if they accept certain of them and treat their\r\npatients on the strength of the mendacious statements it is at the peril\r\nof the patients. Take, for instance, the Antikamnia advertising which\r\nappears in most of the high-class medical journals, and which includes\r\nthe following statements:\r\n\r\n    \"Do not depress the heart.\r\n     Do not produce habit.\r\n     Are accurate--safe--sure.\"\r\n\r\nThese three lines, reproduced as they occur in the medical journals,\r\ncontain five distinct and separate lies--a triumph of condensed\r\nmendacity unequaled, so far as I know, in the \"cure all\" class. For an\r\ninstructive parallel here are two claims made by Duffy's Malt Whiskey,\r\none taken from a medical journal, and hence \"ethical,\" the other\r\ntranscribed from a daily paper and therefore to be condemned by all\r\nmedical men.\r\n\r\nPuzzle: Which is the ethical and which the unethical advertisement?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {063}\r\n\r\n\"It is the only cure and preventative [sic] of consumption, pneumonia,\r\ngrip, bronchitis, coughs, colds, malaria, low fevers and all wasting,\r\nweakening, diseased conditions.\" {064}\r\n\r\n\"Cures general debility, overwork, la grippe, colds, bronchitis,\r\nconsumption, malaria, dyspepsia, depression, exhaustion and weakness\r\nfrom whatever cause.\"\r\n\r\nAll the high-class medical publications accept the advertising\r\nof \"McArthur's Syrup of Hypophosphites,\" which uses the following\r\nstatement: \"It is the enthusiastic conviction of many (physicians) that\r\nits effect is truly specific.\" That looks to me suspiciously like a\r\n\"consumption cure\" shrewdly expressed in pseudo-ethical terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Germicide Family.\r\n\r\nZymoticine, if one may believe various medical publications, \"will\r\nprevent microbe proliferation in the blood streams, and acts as an\r\nefficient eliminator of those germs and their toxins which are already\r\npresent.\" Translating this from its technical language, I am forced to\r\nthe conviction that Zymoticine is half-brother to Liquozone, and if the\r\nlatter is illegitimate at least both are children of Beelzebub, father\r\nof all frauds. Of the same family are the \"ethicals\" Acetozone and\r\nKeimol, as shown by their germicidal claims.\r\n\r\nAgain, I find exploited to the medical profession, through its own\r\norgana, a \"sure cure for dropsy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hygeia presents her latest discovery,\" declares the advertisement, and\r\nfortifies the statement with a picture worthy of Swamp-Root or Lydia\r\nPinkham. Every intelligent physician knows that there is no sure cure\r\nfor dropsy. The alternative implication is that the advertiser hopes to\r\nget his profit by deluding the unintelligent of the profession, and\r\nthat the publications which print his advertisement are willing to hire\r\nthemselves out to the swindle.\r\n\r\nIn one respect some of the medical journals are far below the average of\r\nthe newspapers, and on a par with the worst of the \"religious\" journals.\r\nThey offer their reading space for sale. Here is an extract from a\r\nletter from the _Medical Mirror_ to a well-known \"ethical firm\":\r\n\r\n\"Should you place a contract for this issue we shall publish a 300-word\r\nreport in your interest in our reading columns.\"\r\n\r\nMany other magazines of this class print advertisements as original\r\nreading matter calculated to deceive their subscribers.\r\n\r\nBack of all patent medicine advertising stands the testimonial. Produce\r\nproofs that any nostrum can not in its nature perform the wonders that\r\nit boasts, and its retort is to wave aloft its careful horde or letters\r\nand cry:\r\n\r\n\"We rest on the evidence of those we have cured.\"\r\n\r\nThe crux of the matter lies in the last word. Are the writers of those,\r\nletters really cured? What is the value of these testimonials? Are\r\nthey genuine? Are they honest? Are they, in their nature and from their\r\nsource, entitled to such weight as would convince a reasonable mind?\r\n\r\nThree distinct types suggest themselves: The word of grateful\r\nacknowledgement from a private citizen, couched in such terms as to\r\nbe readily available for advertising purposes; the encomium from some\r\nperson in public life, and the misspelled, illiterate epistle which is\r\nfrom its nature so unconvincing that it never gets into print, and which\r\noutnumbers the other two classes a hundred to one. First of all,\r\nmost nostrums make a point of the mass of evidence. Thousands of\r\ntestimonials, they declare, {065}just as valuable for their purposes as\r\nthose they print, are in their files. This is not true. I have taken\r\nfor analysis, as a fair sample, the \"World's Dispensary Medical Book,\"\r\npublished by the proprietors of Pierce's Favorite Prescription, the\r\nGolden Medical Discovery, Pleasant Pellets, the Pierce Hospital, etc. As\r\nthe dispensers of several nostrums, and because of their long career in\r\nthe business, this firm should be able to show as large a collection of\r\nfavorable letters as any proprietary concern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOverworked Testimonials.\r\n\r\nIn their book, judiciously scattered, I find twenty-six letters twice\r\nprinted, four letters thrice printed and two letters produced four\r\ntimes. Yet the compilers of the book \"have to regret\" (editorially) that\r\nthey can \"find room only for this comparatively small number in this\r\nvolume.\" Why repeat those they have if this is true? If enthusiastic\r\nindorsements poured in on the patent medicine people, the Duffy's Malt\r\nWhiskey advertising management would hardly be driven to purchasing\r\nits letters from the very aged and from disreputable ministers of the\r\ngospel. If all the communications were as convincing as those published,\r\nthe Peruna Company would not have to employ an agent to secure\r\npublishable letters, nor the Liquozone Company indorse across the face\r\nof a letter from a Mrs. Benjamin Charters: \"Can change as we see fit.\"\r\nMany, in fact I believe I may say almost all, of the newspaper-exploited\r\ntestimonials are obtained at an expense to the firm. Agents are\r\nemployed to secure them. This costs money. Druggists get a discount\r\nfor forwarding letters from their customers. This costs money. Persons\r\nwilling to have their picture printed get a dozen photographs for\r\nthemselves. This costs money. Letters of inquiry answered by givers\r\nof testimonials bring a price--25 cents per letter, usually. Here is a\r\ndocument sent out periodically by the Peruna Company to keep in line its\r\n\"unsolicited\" beneficiaries:\r\n\r\n\"As you are aware, we have your testimonial to our remedy. It has been\r\nsome time since we have heard from you, and so we thought best to\r\nmake inquiry as to your present state of health and whether you still\r\noccasionally make use of Peruna. We also want to make sure that we have\r\nyour present street address correctly, and that you are making favorable\r\nanswers to such letters of inquiry which your testimonial may occasion.\r\nRemember that we allow 25 cents for each letter of inquiry. You have\r\nonly to send the letter you receive, together with a copy of your reply\r\nto the same, and we will forward you 25 cents for each pair of letters.\r\n\r\n\"We hope you are still a friend of Peruna and that our continued use\r\nof your testimonial will be agreeable to you. We are inclosing stamped\r\nenvelope for reply. Very sincerely yours,\r\n\r\n\"The Peruna Drug Manufacturing Company,\r\n\r\n\"Per Carr.\"\r\n\r\nAnd here is an account of another typical method of collecting this sort\r\nof material, the writer being a young New Orleans man, who answered an\r\nadvertisement in a local paper, offering profitable special work to a\r\nnews paper man with spare time:\r\n\r\n\"I found the advertiser to be a woman, the coarseness of whose features\r\nwas only equaled by the vulgarity of her manners and speech, and whose\r\nself-assertiveness was in proportion to her bulk. She proposed that I\r\nset about securing testimonials to the excellent qualities of Peruna,\r\nwhich she pronounced 'Pay-Runa,' for which I was to receive a fee of $5\r\nto $10, according to the prominence of 'the guy' from whom I obtained\r\nit. This I declined {066}flatly. She then inquired whether or not I was\r\na member of any social organizations or clubs in the city, and receiving\r\na positive answer she offered me $3 for a testimonial, including the\r\nstatement that Pay-Runa had been used by the members of the Southern\r\nAthletic Club with good effects, and raised it to $5 before I left.\r\n\r\n\"Upon my asking her what her business was before she undertook the\r\nPay-Runa work, she became very angry. Now, when a female is both very\r\nlarge and very angry, the best thing for a small, thin young man to do\r\nis to leave her to her thoughts and the expression thereof. I did it.\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE: ==>] {066}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Questions Desired.\r\n\r\n{067} Testimonials obtained in this way are, in a sense, genuine; that\r\nis, the nostrum firm has documentary evidence that they were given;\r\nbut it is hardly necessary to state that they are not honest. Often\r\nthe handling of the material is very careless, as in the case of Doan's\r\nKidney Pills, which ran an advertisement in a Southern city embodying\r\na letter from a resident of that city who had been dead nearly a year.\r\nCause of death, kidney disease.\r\n\r\nIn a former article I have touched on the matter of testimonials\r\nfrom public men. These are obtained through special agents, through\r\nhangers-on of the newspaper business who wheedle them out of congressmen\r\nor senators, and sometimes through agencies which make a specialty of\r\nthat business. A certain Washington firm made a \"blanket offer\" to a\r\nnostrum company of a $100 joblot of testimonials, consisting of one\r\nDe Wolf Hopper, one Sarah Bernhardt and six \"statesmen,\" one of them a\r\nUnited States senator. Whether they had Mr. Hopper and Mme. Bernhardt\r\nunder agreement or were simply dealing in futures I am unable to say,\r\nbut the offer was made in business-like fashion. And the \"divine Sarah\"\r\nat least seems to be an easy subject for patent medicines, as her\r\nletters to them are by no means rare. Congressmen are notoriously easy\r\nto get, and senators are by no means beyond range. There are several\r\nmen now in the United States Senate who have, at one time or another,\r\nprostituted their names to the uses of fraud medicines, which they do\r\nnot use and of which they know nothing. Naval officers seem to be easy\r\nmarks. Within a few weeks a retired admiral of our navy has besmirched\r\nhimself and his service by acting as pictorial sales agent for Peruna.\r\nIf one carefully considers the \"testimonials\" of this class it will\r\nappear that few of the writers state that they have ever tried the\r\nnostrum. We may put down the \"public man's\" indorsement, then, as\r\ngenuine (documentarily), but not honest. Certainly it can bear no weight\r\nwith an intelligent reader.\r\n\r\nAlmost as eagerly sought for as this class of letter is the medical\r\nindorsement. Medical testimony exploiting any medicine advertised in the\r\nlay press withers under investigation. In the Liquozone article of this\r\nseries I showed how medical evidence is itself \"doctored.\" This was\r\nan extreme instance, for Liquozone, under its original administration,\r\nexhibited less conscience in its methods than any of its competitors\r\nthat I have encountered. Where the testimony itself is not distorted, it\r\nis obtained under false pretences or it comes from men of no standing in\r\nthe profession. Some time ago Duffy's Malt Whiskey sent out an agent to\r\nget testimonials from hospitals. He got them. How he got them is told\r\nin a letter from the physician in charge of a prominent Pennsylvania\r\ninstitution:\r\n\r\n\"A very nice appearing man called here one day and sent in his card,\r\nbearing the name of Dr. Blank (I can't recall the name, but wish I\r\ncould), a graduate of Vermont University. He was as smooth an article as\r\nI have ever been up against, and I have met a good many. He at once\r\ngot down to business and began to talk of the hospitals he had visited,\r\nmentioning physicians whom I knew either personally or by reputation. He\r\nthen brought out a lot of documents for me to peruse, all of which were\r\nbona fide affairs, from the various institutions, signed by the various\r\nphysicians or resident physicians, setting forth the merits or use of\r\n'Duffy's Malt Whiskey.' He asked if I had ever used it. I said yes, but\r\nvery little, and was at the time using some, a fact, as I was sampling\r\nwhat he handed me. He then placed about a dozen small bottles, holding\r\npossibly two ounces, on the table, and said I should keep it, and he\r\nwould send me two quarts free for use here as soon as he got back.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGetting a Testimonial from a Physician.\r\n\r\n{068} \"He next asked me if I would give him a testimonial regarding\r\nDuffy's Whiskey. I said I did not do such things, as it was against\r\nmy principles to do so. 'But this is not for publication,' he said. I\r\nreplied that I had used but little of it, and found it only the same as\r\nany other whisky. He then asked if I was satisfied with the results as\r\nfar as I had used it. I replied that I was. He then asked me to state\r\nthat much, and I very foolishly said I would, on condition that it was\r\nnot to be used as an advertisement, and he assured me it would not be\r\nused. I then, in a few words, said that 'I (or we) have used and are\r\nusing Duffy's Malt Whiskey, and are satisfied with the results,' signing\r\nmy name to the same. He left here, and what was my surprise to receive\r\nlater on a booklet in which was my testimonial and many others, with\r\ncuts of hospitals ranging along with people who had reached 100 years by\r\nuse of the whisky, while seemingly all ailments save ringbone and spavin\r\nwere being cured by this wonderful beverage. I was provoked, but was\r\npaid as I deserved, for allowing a smooth tongue to deceive me. Duffy's\r\nMalt Whiskey has never been inside this place since that day and never\r\nwill be while I have any voice to prevent it. The total amount used at\r\nthe time and before was less than half a gallon.\"\r\n\r\nThis hospital is still used as a reference by the Duffy people.\r\n\r\nMany of the ordinary testimonials which come unsolicited to the\r\nextensively advertised nostrums in great numbers are both genuine and\r\nhonest. What of their value as evidence?\r\n\r\nSome years ago, so goes a story familiar in the drug trade, the general\r\nagent for a large jobbing house declared that he could put out an\r\narticle possessing not the slightest remedial or stimulant properties,\r\nand by advertising it skillfully so persuade people of its virtues that\r\nit would receive unlimited testimonials to the cure of any disease for\r\nwhich he might choose to exploit it. Challenged to a bet, he became a\r\nproprietary owner. Within a year he had won his wager with a collection\r\nof certified \"cures\" ranging from anemia to pneumonia. Moreover, he\r\nfound his venture so profitable that he pushed it to the extent of\r\nthousands of dollars of profits. His \"remedy\" was nothing but sugar. I\r\nhave heard \"Kaskine\" mentioned as the \"cure\" in the case. It answers the\r\nrequirements, or did answer them at that time, according to an analysis\r\nby the Massachusetts State Board of Health, which shows that its\r\npurchasers had been paying $1 an ounce for pure granulated sugar.\r\nWhether \"Kaskine\" was indeed the subject of this picturesque bet, or\r\nwhether it was some other harmless fraud, is immaterial to the point,\r\nwhich is that where the disease cures itself, as nearly all diseases\r\ndo, the medicine gets the benefit of this _viæ medicatriæ naturæ_--the\r\nnatural corrective force which makes for normal health in every human\r\norganism. Obviously, the sugar testimonials can not be regarded as very\r\nweighty evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTestimonials for a Magic Ring.\r\n\r\nThere is being advertised now a finger ring which by the mere wearing\r\ncures any form of rheumatism. The maker of that ring has genuine letters\r\nfrom people who believe that they have been cured by it. Would any one\r\nother than a believer in witchcraft accept those statements? Yet they\r\nare just as \"genuine\" as the bulk of patent medicine letters and written\r\nin as good faith. A very small proportion of the gratuitous indorsements\r\nget into the newspapers, because, as I have said, they do not lend\r\nthemselves {069}well to advertising purposes. I have looked over the\r\noriginals of hundreds of such letters, and more than 90 per cent, of\r\nthem--that is a very conservative estimate--are from illiterate and\r\nobviously ignorant people. Even those few that can be used are rendered\r\nsuitable for publication only by careful editing. The geographical\r\ndistribution is suggestive. Out of 100 specimens selected at random\r\nfrom the Pierce testimonial book, eighty-seven are from small,\r\nremote hamlets, whose very names are unfamiliar to the average man of\r\nintelligence. Only five are from cities of more than 50,000 inhabitants.\r\nNow, Garden City, Kas.; North Yamhill, Ore.; Theresa, Jefferson County,\r\nN. Y.; Parkland, Ky., and Forest Hill, W. Va., may produce an excellent\r\nbrand of Americanism, but one does not look for a very high average of\r\nintelligence in such communities. Is it only a coincidence that the\r\nmountain districts of Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, recognized\r\nas being the least civilized parts of the country, should furnish a\r\nnumber of testimonials, not only to Pierce, but to Peruna, Paine's\r\nCelery Compound and other brands, out of all proportion to their\r\npopulation? On page 65 {065} is a group of Pierce enthusiasts and a\r\ngroup of Peruna witnesses. Should you, on the face of this exhibit,\r\naccept their advice on a matter wholly affecting your physical welfare?\r\nThis is what the advertiser is asking you to do.\r\n\r\nSecure as is the present control of the Proprietary Association over the\r\nnewspapers, there is one point in which I believe almost any journal may\r\nbe made to feel the force of public opinion, and that is the matter of\r\ncommon decency. Newspapers pride themselves on preserving a respectable\r\nmoral standard in their news columns, and it would require no great\r\npressure on the part of the reading public (which is surely immediately\r\ninterested) to extend this standard to the advertising columns. I am\r\nreferring now not only to the unclean sexual, venereal and abortion\r\nadvertisements which deface the columns of a majority of papers, but\r\nalso to the exploitation of several prominent proprietaries.\r\n\r\nRecently a prominent Chicago physician was dining _en famille_ with a\r\nfriend who is the publisher of a rather important paper in a Western\r\ncity. The publisher was boasting that he had so established the\r\neditorial and news policy of his paper that every line of it could be\r\nread without shame in the presence of any adult gathering.\r\n\r\n\"Never anything gets in,\" he declared, \"that I couldn't read at this\r\ntable before my wife, son and daughter.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor, a militant member of his profession, snuffed battle from\r\nafar. \"Have the morning's issue brought,\" he said. Turning to the second\r\npage he began on Swift's Sure Specific, which was headed in large black\r\ntype with the engaging caption, \"Vile, Contagious Blood Poison.\" Before\r\nhe had gone far the 19-year-old daughter of the family, obedient to\r\na glance from the mother, had gone to answer an opportune ring at the\r\ntelephone, and the publisher had grown very red in the face.\r\n\r\n\"I didn't mean the advertisements,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said the visitor, curtly, and passed on to one of the extremely\r\nintimate, confidential and highly corporeal letters to the ghost of\r\nLydia E. Pinkham, which are a constant ornament of the press. The\r\npublisher's son interrupted:\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe that was written for me to hear,\" he observed. \"I'm\r\ntoo young--only 25, you know. Call me when you're through. I'll be out\r\nlooking at the moon.\"\r\n\r\nRelentlessly the physician turned the sheet and began on one of the\r\nChattanooga Medical Company's physiological editorials, entitled \"What\r\n{070}Men Like in a Girl.\" For loathsome and gratuitous indecency, for\r\nleering appeal to their basest passions, this advertisement and the\r\nothers of the Wine of Cardui series sound the depths. The hostess lasted\r\nthrough the second paragraph, when she fled, gasping.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said the physician to his host, \"what do you think of yourself?\"\r\n\r\nThe publisher found no answer, but thereafter his paper was put under\r\na censorship of advertising. Many dailies refuse such \"copy\" as this of\r\nWine of Cardui. And here, I believe, is an opportunity for the entering\r\nwedge. If every subscriber to a newspaper who is interested in keeping\r\nhis home free from contamination would protest and keep on protesting\r\nagainst advertising foulness of this nature, the medical advertiser\r\nwould soon be restricted to the same limits of decency which other\r\nclasses of merchandise accept as a matter of course, for the average\r\nnewspaper publisher is quite sensitive to criticism from his readers. A\r\nrecent instance came under my own notice in the case of the _Auburn_ (N.\r\nY.) _Citizen_, which bought out an old-established daily, taking over\r\nthe contracts, among which was a large amount of low-class patent\r\nmedicine advertising. The new proprietor, a man of high personal\r\nstandards, assured his friends that no objectionable matter would be\r\npermitted in his columns. Shortly after the establishment of the new\r\npaper there appeared an advertisement of Juven Pills, referred to above.\r\nProtests from a number of subscribers followed. Investigation showed\r\nthat a so-called \"reputable\" patent medicine firm had inserted this\r\ndisgraceful paragraph under their contract. Further insertions of the\r\noffending matter were refused and the Hood Company meekly accepted the\r\nsituation. Another central New York daily, the _Utica Press_, rejects\r\nsuch \"copy\" as seems to the manager indecent, and I have yet to hear of\r\nthe paper's being sued for breach of contract. No perpetrator of unclean\r\nadvertising can afford to go to court on this ground, because he knows\r\nthat his matter is indefensible.\r\n\r\nOur national quality of commercial shrewdness fails us when we go into\r\nthe open market to purchase relief from suffering. The average American,\r\nwhen he sets out to buy a horse, or a house, or a box of cigars, is a\r\nmodel of caution. Show him testimonials from any number of prominent\r\ncitizens and he would simply scoff. He will, perhaps, take the word of\r\nhis life-long friend, or of the pastor of his church, but only after\r\nmature thought, fortified by personal investigation. Now observe the\r\nsame citizen seeking to buy the most precious of all possessions, sound\r\nhealth. Anybody's word is good enough for him here. An admiral whose\r\npuerile vanity has betrayed him into a testimonial; an obliging and\r\nconscienceless senator; a grateful idiot from some remote hamlet; a\r\nrenegade doctor or a silly woman who gets a bonus of a dozen photographs\r\nfor her letter--any of these are sufficient to lure the hopeful patient\r\nto the purchase. He wouldn't buy a second-hand bicycle on the affidavit\r\nof any of them, but he will give up his dollar and take his chance of\r\npoison on a mere newspaper statement which he doesn't even investigate.\r\nEvery intelligent newspaper publisher knows that the testimonials which\r\nhe publishes are as deceptive as the advertising claims are false. Yet\r\nhe salves his conscience with the fallacy that the moral responsibility\r\nis on the advertiser and the testimonial-giver. So it is, but the\r\nnewspaper shares it. When an aroused public sentiment shall make our\r\npublic men ashamed to lend themselves to this charlatanry, and shall\r\nenforce on the profession of journalism those standards of decency in\r\nthe field of medical advertising which apply to other advertisers, the\r\nProprietary {071}Association of America will face a crisis more\r\nperilous than any threatened legislation. For printers' ink is the very\r\nlife-blood of the noxious trade. Take from the nostrum vendors the means\r\nby which they influence the millions, and there will pass to the limbo\r\nof pricked bubbles a fraud whose flagrancy and impudence are of minor\r\nimport compared to the cold-hearted greed with which it grinds out its\r\nprofits from the sufferings of duped and eternally hopeful ignorance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PATENT MEDICINE CONSPIRACY AGAINST THE FREEDOM OF THE PRESS.\r\n\r\nReprinted from Collier's Weekly, Nov. 4, 1905. {072}\r\n\r\n     \"Here shall the Press the People's rights maintain.\r\n     Unawed by influence and unbribed by gain.\"\r\n\r\n     --Joseph Story: Motto of the Salem Register.\r\n\r\n_Would any person believe that there is any one subject upon which the\r\nnewspapers of the United States, acting in concert, by prearrangement,\r\nin obedience to wires all drawn by one man, will deny full and free\r\ndiscussion? If such a thing is possible, it is a serious matter, for we\r\nrely upon the newspapers as at once the most forbidding preventive and\r\nthe swiftest and surest corrective of evil. For the haunting possibility\r\nof newspaper exposure, men who know not at all the fear of God pause,\r\nhesitate, and turn back from contemplated rascality. For fear \"it might\r\nget into the papers,\" more men are abstaining from crime and carouse\r\nto-night than for fear of arrest. But these are trite things--only, what\r\nif the newspapers fail us? Relying so wholly on the press to undo evil,\r\nhow shall we deal with that evil with which the press itself has been\r\nseduced into captivity?_\r\n\r\nIn the Lower House of the Massachusetts Legislature one day last March\r\nthere was a debate which lasted one whole afternoon and engaged some\r\ntwenty speakers, on a bill providing that every bottle of patent\r\nmedicine sold in the state should bear a label stating the contents of\r\nthe bottle. More was told concerning patent medicines that afternoon\r\nthan often comes to light in a single day. The debate at times was\r\ndramatic--a member from Salem told of a young woman of his acquaintance\r\nnow in an institution for inebriates as the end of an incident which\r\nbegan with patent medicine dosing for a harmless ill. There was humor,\r\ntoo, in the debate--Representative Walker held aloft a bottle of Peruna\r\nbought by him in a drug store that very day and passed it around for\r\nhis fellow-members to taste and decide for themselves whether Dr.\r\nHarrington, the Secretary of the State Board of Health, was right when\r\nhe told the Legislative Committee that it was merely a \"cheap cocktail.\"\r\n\r\nThe Papers did not Print One Word.\r\n\r\nIn short, the debate was interesting and important--the two qualities\r\nwhich invariably ensure to any event big headlines in the daily\r\nnewspapers. But that debate was not celebrated by big headlines, nor any\r\nheadlines at all. Yet Boston is a city, and Massachusetts is a state,\r\nwhere the proceedings of the legislature figure very large in public\r\ninterest, and where the newspapers respond to that interest by reporting\r\nthe sessions with greater fullness and minuteness than in any\r\nother state. Had that debate {073}been on prison reform, on Sabbath\r\nobservance, the early closing saloon law, on any other subject, there\r\nwould have been, in the next day's papers, overflowing accounts of\r\nverbatim report, more columns of editorial comment, and the picturesque\r\nfeatures of it would have ensured the attention of the cartoonist.\r\n\r\nNow why? Why was this one subject tabooed? Why were the daily accounts\r\nof legislative proceedings in the next day's papers abridged to a\r\nfraction of their usual ponderous length, and all reference to the\r\nafternoon debate on patent medicines omitted? Why was it in vain for the\r\nspeakers in that patent-medicine debate to search for their speeches\r\nin the next day's newspapers? Why did the legislative reporters fail to\r\nfind their work in print? Why were the staff cartoonists forbidden to\r\nexercise their talents on that most fallow and tempting opportunity--the\r\nmembers of the Great and General Court of Massachusetts gravely tippling\r\nPeruna and passing the bottle around to their encircled neighbors, that\r\npractical knowledge should be the basis of legislative action?\r\n\r\nI take it if any man should assert that there is one subject on which\r\nthe newspapers of the United States, acting in concert and as a\r\nunit, will deny full and free discussion, he would be smiled at as an\r\nintemperate fanatic. The thing is too incredible. He would be regarded\r\nas a man with a delusion. And yet I invite you to search the files of\r\nthe daily newspapers of Massachusetts for March 16, 1905, for an account\r\nof the patent-medicine debate that occurred the afternoon of March 15 in\r\nthe Massachusetts Legislature. In strict accuracy it must be said that\r\nthere was one exception. Any one familiar with the newspapers of the\r\nUnited States will already have named it--the Springfield _Republican_.\r\nThat paper, on two separate occasions, gave several columns to the\r\nrecord of the proceedings of the legislature on the patent-medicine\r\nbill. Why the otherwise universal silence?\r\n\r\nThe patent-medicine business in the United States is one of huge\r\nfinancial proportions. The census of 1900 placed the value of the annual\r\nproduct at $59,611,355. Allowing for the increase of half a decade of\r\nrapid growth, it must be to-day not less than seventy-five millions.\r\nThat is the wholesale price. The retail price of all the patent\r\nmedicines sold in the United States in one year may be very\r\nconservatively placed at one hundred million dollars. And of this one\r\nhundred millions which the people of the United States pay for patent\r\nmedicines yearly, fully forty millions goes to the newspapers. Have\r\npatience! I have more to say than merely to point out the large revenue\r\nwhich newspapers receive from patent medicines, and let inference do the\r\nrest. Inference has no place in this story. There are facts a-plenty.\r\nBut it is essential to point out the intimate financial relation between\r\nthe newspapers and the patent medicines. I was told by the man who for\r\nmany years handled the advertising of the Lydia E. Pinkham Company that\r\ntheir expenditure was $100,000 a month, $1,200,000 a year. Dr. Pierce\r\nand the Peruna Company both advertise more extensively than the Pinkham\r\nCompany. Certainly there are at least five patent-medicine concerns\r\nin the United States who each pay out to the newspapers more than one\r\nmillion dollars a year. When the Dr. Greene Nervura Company of Boston\r\nwent into bankruptcy, its debts to newspapers for advertising amounted\r\nto $535,000. To the Boston _Herald_ alone it owed $5,000, and to so\r\nsmall a paper, comparatively, as the Atlanta _Constitution_ it owed\r\n$1,500. One obscure {074}quack doctor in New York, who did merely an\r\noffice business, was raided by the authorities, and among the papers\r\nseized there were contracts showing that within a year he had paid to\r\none paper for advertising $5,856.80; to another $20,000. Dr. Humphreys,\r\none of the best known patent-medicine makers, has said to his\r\nfellow-members of the Patent Medicine Association: \"The twenty thousand\r\nnewspapers of the United States make more money from advertising\r\nthe proprietary medicines than do the proprietors of the medicines\r\nthemselves.... Of their receipts, one-third to one-half goes for\r\nadvertising.\" More than six years ago, Cheney, the president of the\r\nNational Association of Patent Medicine Men, estimated the yearly amount\r\npaid to the newspapers by the larger patent-medicine concerns at twenty\r\nmillion dollars--more than one thousand dollars to each daily, weekly\r\nand monthly periodical in the United States.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {074}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSilence is the Fixed Quantity.\r\n\r\nDoes this throw any light on the silence of the Massachusetts papers?\r\n{075}\r\n\r\nNaturally such large sums paid by the patent-medicine men to the\r\nnewspapers suggest the thought of favor. But silence is too important a\r\npart of the patent-medicine man's business to be left to the capricious\r\nchance of favor. Silence is the most important thing in his business.\r\nThe ingredients of his medicine--that is nothing. Does the price of\r\ngoldenseal go up? Substitute whisky. Does the price of whisky go up? Buy\r\nthe refuse wines of the California vineyards. Does the price of opium go\r\ntoo high, or the public fear of it make it an inexpedient thing to use?\r\nTake it out of the formula and substitute any worthless barnyard\r\nweed. But silence is the fixed quantity--silence as to the frauds he\r\npractices; silence as to the abominable stewings and brewings that enter\r\ninto his nostrum; silence as to the deaths and sicknesses he causes;\r\nsilence as to the drug fiends he makes, the inebriate asylums he fills.\r\nSilence he must have. So he makes silence a part of the contract.\r\n\r\nRead the significant silence of the Massachusetts newspapers in the\r\nlight of the following contracts for advertising. They are the regular\r\nprinted form used by Hood, Ayer and Munyon in making their advertising\r\ncontracts with thousands of newspapers throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nOn page 80 [IMAGE ==>] {080} is shown the contract made by the J. C.\r\nAyer Company, makers of Ayer's Sarsaparilla. At the top is the name of\r\nthe firm, \"The J. C. Ayer Company, Lowell,, Mass.,\" and the date. Then\r\nfollows a blank for the number of dollars, and then the formal contract:\r\n\"We hereby agree, for the sum of............ Dollars per year,........to\r\ninsert in the............. published at............... the advertisement\r\nof the J. C. Ayer Company.\" Then follow the conditions as to space to be\r\nused each issue, the page the advertisement is to be on and the position\r\nit is to occupy. Then these two remarkable conditions of the contract:\r\n\"First--It is agreed in case any law or laws are enacted, either state\r\nor national, harmful to the interests of the T. C. Ayer Company, that\r\nthis contract may be canceled by them from date of such enactment, and\r\nthe insertions made paid for pro-rata with the contract price.\"\r\n\r\nThis clause is remarkable enough. But of it more later. For the present\r\nexamine the second clause: \"Second--It is agreed that the J. C. Ayer Co.\r\nmay cancel this contract, pro-rata, in case advertisements are published\r\nin this paper in which their products are offered, with a view to\r\nsubstitution or other harmful motive; also in case any matter otherwise\r\ndetrimental to the J. C. Ayer Company's interest is permitted to appear\r\nin the reading columns or elsewhere in the paper.\"\r\n\r\nThis agreement is signed in duplicate, one by the J. C. Ayer Company and\r\nthe other one by the newspaper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll Muzzle-Clauses Alike.\r\n\r\nThat is the contract of silence. (Notice the next one, in identically\r\nthe same language, bearing the name of the C. I. Hood Company, the\r\nother great manufacturer of sarsaparilla; and then the third--again in\r\nidentically the same words--for Dr. Munyon.) That is the clause which\r\nwith forty million dollars, muzzles the press of the country. I wonder\r\nif the Standard Oil Company could, for forty million dollars, bind\r\nthe newspapers of the United States in a contract that \"no matter\r\ndetrimental to the Standard Oil Company's interests be permitted to\r\nappear in the reading columns or elsewhere in this paper.\"\r\n\r\nIs it a mere coincidence that in each of these contracts the silence\r\n{076}clause is framed in the same words? Is the inference fair that\r\nthere is an agreement among the patent-medicine men and quack doctors\r\neach to impose this contract on all the newspapers with which it deals,\r\none reaching the newspapers which the other does not, and all combined\r\nreaching all the papers in the United States, and effecting a universal\r\nagreement among newspapers to print nothing detrimental to patent\r\nmedicines? You need not take it as an inference. I shall show it later\r\nas a fact.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {076}\r\n\r\n\"In the reading columns or elsewhere in this paper.\" The paper must not\r\nprint itself, nor must it allow any outside party, who might wish to\r\ndo so, to pay the regular advertising rates and print the truth about\r\npatent medicines in the advertising columns. More than a year ago, just\r\nafter Mr. Bok had printed his first article exposing patent medicines,\r\na business man in St. Louis, a man of great wealth, conceived that it\r\nwould {077}help his business greatly if he could have Mr. Bok's article\r\nprinted as an advertisement in every newspaper in the United States.\r\nHe gave the order to a firm of advertising agents and the firm began in\r\nTexas, intending to cover the country to Maine. But that advertisement\r\nnever got beyond a few obscure country papers in Texas. The contract of\r\nsilence was effective; and a few weeks later, at their annual meeting,\r\nthe patent-medicine association \"Resolved\"--I quote the minutes--\"That\r\nthis Association commend the action of the great majority of the\r\npublishers of the United States who have consistently refused said false\r\nand malicious attacks in the shape of advertisements which in whole or\r\nin part libel proprietary medicines.\"\r\n\r\nI have said that the identity of the language of the silence clause\r\nin several patent-medicine advertising contracts suggests mutual\r\nunderstanding among the nostrum makers, a preconceived plan; and I\r\nhave several times mentioned the patent-medicine association. It seems\r\nincongruous, almost humorous, to speak of a national organization of\r\nquack doctors and patent-medicine makers; but there is one, brought\r\ntogether for mutual support, for co-operation, for--but just what\r\nthis organization is for, I hope to show. No other organization ever\r\ndemonstrated so clearly the truth that \"in union there is strength.\" Its\r\nofficial name is an innocent-seeming one--\"The Proprietary Association\r\nof America.\" There are annual meetings, annual reports, a constitution,\r\nby-laws. And I would call special attention to Article II of those\r\nby-laws.\r\n\r\n\"The objects of this association,\" says this article, \"are: to protect\r\nthe rights of its members to the respective trade-marks that they may\r\nown or control; to establish such mutual co-operation as may be required\r\nin the various branches of the trade; to reduce all burdens that may\r\nbe oppressive; to facilitate and foster equitable principles in the\r\npurchase and sale of merchandise; to acquire and preserve for the use\r\nof its members such business information as may be of value to them; to\r\nadjust controversies and promote harmony among its members.\"\r\n\r\nThat is as innocuous a statement as ever was penned of the objects of\r\nany organization. It might serve for an organization of honest cobblers.\r\nChange a few words, without altering the spirit in the least, and a body\r\nof ministers might adopt it. In this laboriously complete statement\r\nof objects, there is no such word as \"lobby\" or \"lobbying.\" Indeed, so\r\nharmless a word as \"legislation\" is absent--strenuously absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhere the Money Goes.\r\n\r\nBut I prefer to discover the true object of the organization of the\r\n\"Proprietary Association of America\" in another document than Article\r\nII of the by-laws. Consider the annual report of the treasurer, say\r\nfor 1904. The total of money paid out during the year was $8,516.26.\r\nOf this, one thousand dollars was for the secretary's salary, leaving\r\n$7,516.26 to be accounted for. Then there is an item of postage, one\r\nof stationery, one of printing--the little routine expenses of every\r\norganization; and finally there is this remarkable item:\r\n\r\nLegislative Committee, total expenses, $6,606.95.\r\n\r\nTruly, the Proprietary Association of America seems to have several\r\n{078}objects, as stated in its by-laws, which cost it very little, and\r\none object--not stated in its by-laws at all--which costs it all its\r\nannual revenue aside from the routine expenses of stationery, postage\r\nand secretary. If just a few more words of comment may be permitted on\r\nthis point, does it not seem odd that so large an item as $6,606.95,\r\nout of a total budget of only $8,516.26, should be put in as a lump sum,\r\n\"Legislative Committee, total expenses\"? And would not the annual report\r\nof the treasurer of the Proprietary Association of America be a more\r\nentertaining document if these \"total expenses\" of the Legislative\r\nCommittee were carefully itemized?\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {078}\r\n\r\nNot that I mean to charge the direct corruption of legislatures. The\r\nProprietary Association of America used to do that. They used to spend,\r\naccording to the statement of the present president of the organization,\r\nMr. F. J. Cheney, as much as seventy-five thousand dollars a year. But\r\nthat was before Mr. Cheney himself discovered a better way. The fighting\r\nof public health legislation is the primary object and chief activity,\r\nthe very raison d'etre, of the Proprietary Association. The motive back\r\nof bringing the quack doctors and patent-medicine manufacturers of the\r\nUnited States into a mutual organization was this: Here are some\r\nscores of men, each paying a large sum annually to the newspapers. The\r\naggregate of these sums is forty million dollars. By organization, the\r\nfull effect of this money can be got and used as a unit in preventing\r\nthe passage of laws which would compel them to tell the contents of\r\ntheir nostrums, and in suppressing the newspaper publicity which would\r\ndrive them {079}into oblivion. So it was no mean intellect which devised\r\nthe scheme whereby every newspaper in America is made an active lobbyist\r\nfor the patent-medicine association. The man who did it is the present\r\npresident of the organization, its executive head in the work of\r\nsuppressing public knowledge, stifling public opinion and warding off\r\npublic health legislation, the Mr. Cheney already mentioned. He makes\r\na catarrh cure which, according to the Massachusetts State Board of\r\nHealth, contains fourteen and three-fourths per cent, of alcohol. As\r\nto his scheme for making the newspapers of America not only maintain\r\nsilence, but actually lobby in behalf of the patent medicines, I am glad\r\nthat I am not under the necessity of describing it in my own words.\r\nIt would be easy to err in the direction that makes for incredulity.\r\nFortunately, I need take no responsibility. I have Mr. Cheney's own\r\nwords, in which he explained his scheme to his fellow-members of the\r\nProprietary Association of America. The quotation marks alone (and the\r\ncomment within the parentheses) are mine. The remainder is the language\r\nof Mr. Cheney himself:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Cheney's Plan.\r\n\r\n\"We have had a good deal of difficulty in the last few years with the\r\ndifferent legislatures of the different states.... I believe I have a\r\nplan whereby we will have no difficulty whatever with these people. I\r\nhave used it in my business for two years and know it is a practical\r\nthing.... I, inside of the last two years, have made contracts with\r\nbetween fifteen and sixteen thousand newspapers, and never had but one\r\nman refuse to sign the contract, and my saying to him that I could not\r\nsign a contract without this clause in it he readily signed it. My point\r\nis merely to shift the responsibility. We to-day have the responsibility\r\non our shoulders. As you all know, there is hardly a year but we have\r\nhad a lobbyist in the different state legislatures--one year in New\r\nYork, one year in New Jersey, and so on.\" (Read that frank confession\r\ntwice--note the bland matter-of-factness of it.) \"There has been a\r\nconstant fear that something would come up, so I had this clause in my\r\ncontract added. This is what I have in every contract I make: 'It is\r\nhereby agreed that should your state, or the United States Government,\r\npass any law that would interfere with or restrict the sale of\r\nproprietary medicines, this contract shall become void.'... In the\r\nstate of Illinois a few years ago they wanted to assess me three hundred\r\ndollars. I thought I had a better plan than this, so I wrote to about\r\nforty papers and merely said: 'Please look at your contract with me and\r\ntake note that if this law passes you and I must stop doing business,\r\nand my contracts cease.'\" The next week every one of them had an article,\r\nand Mr. Man had to go....\r\n\r\nI read this to Dr. Pierce some days ago and he was very much taken up\r\nwith it. I have carried this through and know it is a success. I know\r\nthe papers will accept it. Here is a thing that costs us nothing. We\r\nare guaranteed against the $75,000 loss for nothing. It throws the\r\nresponsibility on the newspapers.... I have my contracts printed and\r\nI have this printed in red type, right square across the contract, so\r\nthere can be absolutely no mistake, and the newspaper man can not say\r\nto me, 'I did not see it.' He did see it and knows what he is doing. It\r\nseems to me it is a point worth every man's attention.... I think this\r\nis pretty near a sure thing.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {080}\r\n\r\nTHIS IS THE FORM OF CONTRACT--SEE (A) (B) (C)--THAT MUZZLES THE PRESS OF\r\nTHE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the contract lies in the clause which is marked with\r\nbrackets, to the effect that the agreement is voidable, In case any\r\nmatter detrimental to the advertiser's interests \"Is permitted to appear\r\nin the reading columns, or elsewhere, in this paper.\" This clause,\r\nin the same words, appears in all three of these patent-medicine\r\nadvertising contracts. The documents reproduced here were gathered\r\nfrom three different newspapers in widely separated parts of the United\r\nStates. The name of the paper in each case has been suppressed in order\r\nto shield the publisher from the displeasure of the patent-medicine\r\ncombination. How much publishers are compelled to fear this displeasure\r\nis exemplified by the experience of the Cleveland _Press,_ from whose\r\ncolumns $18,000 worth of advertising was withdrawn within forty-eight\r\nhours. {081}\r\n\r\nI should like to ask the newspaper owners and editors of America what\r\nthey think of that scheme. I believe that the newspapers, when they\r\nsigned each individual contract, were not aware that they were being\r\ndragooned into an elaborately thought-out scheme to make every newspaper\r\nin the United States, from the greatest metropolitan daily to the\r\nremotest country weekly, an active, energetic, self-interested lobbyist\r\nfor the patent-medicine association. If the newspapers knew how they\r\nwere being used as cat's-paws, I believe they would resent it. Certainly\r\nthe patent-medicine association itself feared this, and has kept this\r\nplan of Mr. Cheney's a careful secret. In this same meeting of the\r\nProprietary Association of America, just after Mr. Cheney had made the\r\nspeech quoted above, and while it was being resolved that every other\r\npatent-medicine man should put the same clause in his contract, the\r\nvenerable Dr. Humphreys, oldest and wisest of the guild, arose and said:\r\n\"Will it {082}not be now just as well to act on this, each and every one\r\nfor himself, instead of putting this on record?... I think the idea is\r\na good one, But really don't think it had better go in our proceedings.\"\r\nAnd another fellow nostrum-maker, seeing instantly the necessity\r\nof secrecy said: \"I am heartily in accord with Dr. Humphreys. The\r\nsuggestion is a good one, but when we come to put in our public\r\nproceedings, and state that we have adopted such a resolution, I want to\r\nsay that the legislators are just as sharp as the newspaper men.... As\r\na consequence, this will decrease the weight of the press comments.\r\nSome of the papers, also, who would not come in, would publish something\r\nabout it in the way of getting square.....\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {082}\r\n\r\nThis contract is the backbone of the scheme. The further details, the\r\norganization of the bureau to carry it into effect--that, too, has been\r\nkept carefully concealed from the generally unthinking newspapers,\r\nwho are all unconsciously mere individual cogs in the patent-medicine\r\nlobbying machine. At one of the meetings of the association, Dr. R. V.\r\nPierce of Buffalo arose and said (I quote him verbatim):... \"I would\r\nmove you that the report of the Committee on Legislation be made a\r\nspecial order to be taken up immediately... that it be considered\r\nin executive session, and that every person not a member of the\r\norganization be asked to retire, so that it may be read and considered\r\nin executive session. There are matters and suggestions in reference to\r\nour future action, and measures to be taken which are advised therein,\r\nthat we would not wish to have published broadcast over the country for\r\nvery good reasons.\"\r\n\r\nNow what were the \"matters and suggestions\" which Dr. Pierce \"would\r\nnot wish to have published broadcast over the country for very good\r\nreasons?\" {083}\r\n\r\nCan Mr. Cheney Reconcile These Statements?\r\n\r\n\r\nLetter addressed to Mr. William Allen White, Editor of the Gazette,\r\nEmporia, Kan.\r\n\r\nBy Frank J. Cheney.\r\n\r\nDear Sir--\r\n\r\nI have read with a great deal of interest, to-day, an article in\r\nColliers illustrating therein the contract between your paper and\r\nourselves, [see p. 18--Editor.] {018}Mr. S. Hopkins Adams endeavored very\r\nhard (as I understand) to find me, but I am sorry to say that I was not\r\nat home. I really believe that I could have explained that clause of\r\nthe contract to his entire satisfaction, and thereby saved him the\r\nhumiliation of making an erratic statement.\r\n\r\nThis is the first intimation that I ever have had that that clause was\r\nput into the contract to control the Press in any way, or the editorial\r\ncolumns of the Press. I believe that if Mr. Adams was making contracts\r\nnow, and making three-year contracts, the same as we are, taking into\r\nconsideration the conditions of the different legislatures, he would be\r\ndesirous of this same paragraph as a safety guard to protect himself, in\r\ncase any State did pass a law prohibiting the sale of our goods.\r\n\r\nHis argument surely falls flat when he takes into consideration the\r\nconduct of the North Dakota Legislature, because every newspaper in that\r\nState that we advertise in hid contracts containing that clause. Why\r\nwe should be compelled to pay for from one to two years' advertising or\r\nmore, in a State where we could not sell our goods, is more than I can\r\nunderstand. As before stated, it is merely a precautionary paragraph to\r\nmeet conditions such as now {084}exist in North Dakota. We were\r\ncompelled to withdraw from that State because we would not publish our\r\nformula, and, therefore, under this contract, we are not compelled to\r\ncontinue our advertising.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from a speech delivered before the Proprietary Association of\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nBy Frank J. Cheney.\r\n\r\n\"We have had a good deal of difficulty in the last few years with the\r\ndifferent legislatures of the different states.... I believe I have a\r\nplan whereby we will have no difficulty whatever with these people. I\r\nhave used it in my business for two years, and I know it is a practical\r\nthing.... I, inside of the last two years, have made contracts with\r\nbetween fifteen and sixteen thousand newspapers, and never had but one\r\nman refuse to sign the contract, and by saying to him that I could not\r\nsign a contract without this clause in it he readily signed it. My point\r\nis merely to shift the responsibility. We to-day have the responsibility\r\nof the whole matter upon our shoulders....\r\n\r\n\"There? has been constant fear that something would come up, so I had\r\nthis clause in my contract added. This is what I have in every contract\r\nI make: 'It is hereby agreed that should your State, or the United\r\nStates government, pass any law that would interfere with or restrict\r\nthe sale of proprietary medicines, his contract shall become void.'...\r\nIn the State of Illinois a few years ago they wanted to assess me three\r\nhundred dollars. I thought I had a better plan than this, so I wrote to\r\nabout forty papers, and merely said: 'Please look at your contract with\r\nme and take note that if this law passes you and I must stop doing\r\nbusiness, and my contracts cease.'

He did see it and knows what he is doing. It\r\nseems to me it is a point worth every man's attention.... I think this\r\nis pretty near a sure thing.\"\r\n\r\nTo illustrate: There are 739 publications in your State--619 of these\r\nare dailies and weeklies. Out of this number we are advertising in over\r\n500, at an annual expenditure of $8,000 per year (estimated). We make a\r\nthree-year contract with all of them, and, therefore, our liabilities in\r\nyour State are $24,000, providing, of course, all these contracts were\r\nmade at the same date. Should these contracts all be made this fall\r\nand your State should pass a law this winter (three months later)\r\nprohibiting the sale of our goods, there would be virtually a loss to us\r\nof $24,000. Therefore, for a business precaution to guard against just\r\nsuch conditions, we add the red paragraph referred to in Collier's.\r\n\r\nI make this statement to you, as I am credited with being the originator\r\nof the paragraph, and I believe that I am justified in adding this\r\nparagraph to our contract, not for the purpose of controlling the Press,\r\nbut, as before stated, as a business precaution which any man should\r\ntake who expects to pay his bills.\r\n\r\nWill you kindly give me your version of the situation? Awaiting an early\r\nreply, I am,\r\n\r\nSincerely yours,\r\n\r\nFRANK J. CHENEY.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {083}\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {084}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nValuable Newspaper Aid.\r\n\r\n{085} Dr. Pierce's son, Dr. V. Mott Pierce, was chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Legislation. He was the author of the \"matters and\r\nsuggestions\" which must be considered in the dark. \"Never before,\" said\r\nhe, \"in the history of the Proprietary Association were there so many\r\nbills in different state legislatures that were vital to our interests.\r\nThis was due, we think, to an effort on the part of different state\r\nboards of health, who have of late years held national meetings, to make\r\nan organized effort to establish what are known as 'pure food laws.'\"\r\nThen the younger Pierce stated explicitly the agency responsible for the\r\ndefeat of this public health legislation: \"We must not forget to\r\nplace the honor where due for our uniform success in defeating class\r\nlegislation directed against our legitimate pursuits. The American\r\nNewspaper Publishers' Association has rendered us valued aid through\r\ntheir secretary's office in New York and we can hardly overestimate the\r\npower brought to bear at Washington by individual newspapers.\"... (On\r\nanother occasion, Dr. Pierce, speaking of two bills in the Illinois\r\nLegislature, said: \"Two things operated to bring these bills to the\r\ndanger line. In the first place, the Chicago papers were almost wholly\r\nwithout influence in the Legislature.... Had it not been for the active\r\nco-operation of the state outside of Chicago there is absolute certainty\r\nthat the bill would have passed.... I think that a great many members\r\ndo not appreciate the power that we can bring to bear on legislation\r\nthrough the press.\") But this power, in young Dr. Pierce's opinion, must\r\nbe organized and systematized. \"If it is not presumptuous on the part of\r\nyour chairman,\" he said modestly, \"to outline a policy which experience\r\nseems to dictate for the future, it would be briefly as follows\"--here\r\nthe younger Pierce explains the \"matters and suggestions\" which must\r\nnot be \"published broadcast over the country.\" The first was \"the\r\norganization of a Legislative Bureau, with its offices in New York or\r\nChicago. Second, a secretary, to be appointed by the chairman of the\r\nCommittee on Legislation, who will receive a stated salary, sufficiently\r\nlarge to be in keeping with such person's ability, and to compensate him\r\nfor the giving of all his time to this work.\"\r\n\r\n\"The benefits of such a working bureau to the Proprietary Association,\"\r\nsaid Dr. Pierce, \"can be foreseen: First, a systematic plan to acquire\r\nearly knowledge of pending or threatened legislation could be taken up.\r\nIn the past we have relied too much on newspaper managers to acquaint us\r\nof such bills coming up.... Another plan would be to have the regulation\r\nformula bill, for instance, introduced by some friendly legislator, and\r\nhave it referred to his own committee, where he could hold it until\r\nall danger of such another bill being introduced were over, and the\r\nLegislature had adjourned.\"\r\n\r\nLittle wonder Dr. Pierce wanted a secret session to cover up the frank\r\n{087}naïveté of his son, which he did not \"wish to have published\r\nbroadcast over the country, for very good reasons.\"\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {086}\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF WHAT MR. CHENEY CALLS \"SHIFTING THE RESPONSIBILITY.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was sent by the publishers of one of the leading newspapers\r\nof Wisconsin to Senator Noble of that state. It illustrates the method\r\nadopted by the patent-medicine makers to compel the newspapers In each\r\nstate to do their lobbying for them. Senator Noble introduced a bill\r\nrequiring patent-medicine manufacturers to state on their labels the\r\npercentage of various poisons which every bottle might contain. Senator\r\nNoble and a few others fought valiantly for their bill throughout\r\nthe whole of the last session of the Wisconsin Legislature, but were\r\ndefeated by the united action of the newspaper publishers, who, as this\r\nletter shows, exerted pressure of every kind, Including threats, to\r\ncompel members of the Legislature to vote against the bill.\r\n\r\nIn discussing this plan for a legislative bureau, another member told\r\nwhat in his estimation was needed. \"The trouble,\" said he--I quote\r\nfrom the minutes--\"the trouble we will have in attempting to buy\r\nlegislation--supposing we should attempt it--is that we will never know\r\nwhat we are buying until we get through. We may have paid the wrong man,\r\nand the bill is passed and we are out. It is not a safe proposition, if\r\nwe consider it legitimate, which we do not.\"\r\n\r\nTrue, it is not legitimate, but the main point is, it's not safe; that's\r\nthe thing to be considered.\r\n\r\nThe patent-medicine man continued to elaborate on the plans proposed\r\nby Dr. Pierce: \"It would not be a safe proposition at all. What this\r\nassociation should have... is a regularly established bureau.... We\r\nshould have all possible information on tap, and we should have a list\r\nof the members of the legislature of every state. We should have a list\r\nof the most influential men that control them, or that can influence\r\nthem.... For instance, if in the state of Ohio a bill comes up that is\r\nadverse to us, turn to the books, find out who are members of the\r\nlegislature there, who are the publishers of the papers in the state,\r\nwhere they are located, which are the Republican and which the\r\nDemocratic papers.... It will take money, but if the money is rightly\r\nspent, it will be the best investment ever made.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trust's Club for Legislators.\r\n\r\nThat is about as comprehensive, as frankly impudent a scheme of\r\ncontrolling legislation as it is possible to imagine. The plan was put\r\nin the form of a resolution, and the resolution was passed. And so the\r\nProprietary Association of America maintains a lawyer in Chicago, and\r\na permanent secretary, office and staff. In every state it maintains\r\nan agent whose business it is to watch during the session of the\r\nLegislature each day's batch of new bills, and whenever a bill affecting\r\npatent medicines shows its head to telegraph the bill, verbatim, to\r\nheadquarters. There some scores of printed copies of the bill are made,\r\nand a copy is sent to every member of the association--to the Peruna\r\npeople, to Dr. Pierce at Buffalo, to Kilmer at Birmingham, to Cheney at\r\nToledo, to the Pinkham people at Lynn, and to all the others. Thereon\r\neach manufacturer looks up the list of papers in the threatened state\r\nwith which he has the contracts described above. And to each newspaper\r\nhe sends a peremptory telegram calling the publisher's attention to the\r\nobligations of his contract, and commanding him to go to work to defeat\r\nthe anti-patent-medicine bill. In practice, this organization works with\r\nsmooth perfection and well-oiled accuracy to defeat the public health\r\nlegislation which is introduced by boards of health in over a score of\r\nstates every year. To illustrate, let me describe as typical the\r\nhistory of the public health bills which were introduced and defeated\r\nin Massachusetts last year. I have already mentioned them as showing how\r\nthe newspapers, obeying that part of their contract which requires\r\nthem to print nothing harmful to patent medicines, refused to print\r\nany account of the exposures which were made by several members of the\r\nLegislature during the debate of the bill. I wish here to describe their\r\nobedience to that other clause of the {088}contract, in living up to\r\nwhich they printed scores of bitterly partisan editorials against the\r\npublic health bill, and against its authors personally; threatened with\r\npolitical death those members of the Legislature who were disposed to\r\nvote in favor of it, and even, in the persons of editors and owners,\r\nwent up to the State House and lobbied personally against the bill. And\r\nsince I have already told of Mr. Cheney's author-ship of the scheme, I\r\nwill here reproduce, as typical of all the others (all the other large\r\npatent-medicine concerns sent similar letters and telegrams), the letter\r\nwhich Mr. Cheney himself on the 14th day of February sent to all\r\nthe newspapers in Massachusetts with which he has lobbying\r\ncontracts--practically every newspaper in the state:\r\n\r\n\"Toledo, Ohio, Feb. 14, 1905.\r\n\r\n\"Publishers\r\n\r\n\"----- Mass.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen:\r\n\r\n\"Should House bills Nos. 829, 30, 607, 724, or Senate bill No. 185\r\nbecome laws, it will force us to discontinue advertising in your state.\r\nYour prompt attention regarding this bill we believe would be of mutual\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n\"We would respectfully refer you to the contract which we have with you.\r\n\r\n\"Respectfully,\r\n\r\n\"Cheney Medicine Company.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNow here is the fruit which that letter bore: a strong editorial against\r\nthe anti-patent-medicine bill, denouncing it and its author in the most\r\nvituperative language, a marked copy of which was sent to every member\r\nof the Massachusetts Legislature. But this was not all that this one\r\nzealous publisher did; he sent telegrams to a number of members, and a\r\npersonal letter to the representative of his district calling on that\r\nmember not only to vote, but to use his influence against the bill, on\r\nthe pain of forfeiting the paper's favor.\r\n\r\nNow this seems to me a shameful thing--that a Massachusetts newspaper,\r\nof apparent dignity and outward high standing, should jump to the\r\ncracking of the whip of a nostrum-maker in Ohio; that honest and\r\nwell-meaning members of the Massachusetts Legislature, whom all the\r\nmoney of Rockefeller could not buy, who obey only the one thing\r\nwhich they look on as the expression of the public opinion of their\r\nconstituents, the united voice of the press of their district--that\r\nthese men should unknowingly cast their votes at the dictate of a\r\nnostrum-maker in Ohio, who, if he should deliver his command personally\r\nand directly, instead of through a newspaper supine enough to let him\r\ncontrol it for a hundred dollars a year, would be scorned and flouted.\r\n\r\nAny self-respecting newspaper must be humiliated by the attitude of\r\nthe patent-medicine association. They don't ASK the newspapers to do\r\nit--they ORDER it done. Read again Mr. Cheney's account of his plan,\r\nnote the half-contemptuous attitude toward the newspapers. And read\r\nagain Mr. Cheney's curt letter to the Massachusetts papers; Observe the\r\nthreat, just sufficiently veiled to make it more of a threat; and the\r\nformal order from a superior to a clerk: \"We would respectfully refer\r\nyou to the contract which we have with you.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the threat is not an empty one. The newspaper which refuses to\r\naid the patent-medicine people is marked. Some time ago Dr. V. Mott\r\n{089}Pierce of Buffalo was chairman of what is called the \"Committee on\r\nLegislation\" of the Proprietary Association of America. He was giving\r\nhis annual report to the association. \"We are happy to say,\" said\r\nhe, \"that though over a dozen bills were before the different State\r\nLegislatures last winter and spring, yet we have succeeded in defeating\r\nall the bills which were prejudicial to proprietary interests without\r\nthe use of money, and through the vigorous co-operation and aid of the\r\npublishers. January 23 your committee sent out letters to the principal\r\npublications in New York asking their aid against this measure. It is\r\nhardly necessary to state that the publishers of New York responded\r\ngenerously against these harmful measures. The only small exception was\r\nthe _Evening Star_ of Poughkeepsie, N. Y., the publisher of which, in a\r\nvery discourteous letter, refused to assist us in any way.\"\r\n\r\nIs it to be doubted that Dr. Pierce reported this exception to his\r\nfellow patent-medicine men, that they might make note of the offending\r\npaper, and bear it in mind when they made their contracts the following\r\nyear? There are other cases which show what happens to the newspaper\r\nwhich offends the patent-medicine men. I am fortunate enough to be\r\nable to describe the following incident in the language of the man who\r\nwielded the club, as he told the story with much pride to his fellow\r\npatent-medicine men at their annual meeting:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen of the Proprietary Association,\" said Mr.\r\nCooper, \"I desire to present to you a situation which I think it is\r\nincumbent on manufacturers generally to pay some attention to--namely,\r\nthe publication of sensational drug news which appears from time to time\r\nin the leading papers of the country.... There are, no doubt, many of\r\nyou in the room, at least a dozen, who are familiar with the sensational\r\narticles that appeared in the Cleveland _Press_. Gentlemen, this is a\r\nquestion that appeals to you as a matter of business.... The Cleveland\r\nPress indulged in a tirade against the so-called 'drug trust.'... (the\r\n'drug trust' is the same organization of patent-medicine men--including\r\nPierce, Pinkham, Peruna, Kilmer and all the well-known ones--which I\r\nhave referred to as the patent-medicine association. Its official name\r\nis the Proprietary Association of America.) \"I sent out the following\r\nletter to fifteen manufacturers\" (of patent medicines):\r\n\r\n\"'Gentlemen--Inclosed we hand you a copy of matter which is appearing\r\nin the Cleveland papers. It is detrimental to the drug business to have\r\nthis matter agitated in a sensational way.\r\n\r\nIn behalf of the trade we would ask you to use your influence with the\r\npapers in Cleveland to discontinue this unnecessary publicity, and if\r\nyou feel you can do so, we would like to have you wire the business\r\nmanagers of the Cleveland papers to discontinue their sensational\r\ndrug articles, as it is proving very injurious to your business.\r\nRespectfully, E. R. Cooper.'\r\n\r\n\"Because of that letter which we sent out, the Cleveland Press received\r\ninside of forty-eight hours telegrams from six manufacturers canceling\r\nthousands of dollars' worth of advertising and causing a consequent\r\ndearth of sensational matter along drug lines. It resulted in a loss\r\nto one paper alone of over eighteen thousand dollars in advertising.\r\nGentlemen, when you touch a man's pocket, you touch him where he lives;\r\nthat principle {090}is true of the newspaper editor or the retail\r\ndruggist, and goes through all business.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trust's Club for Newspapers.\r\n\r\nThat is the account of how the patent-medicine man used his club on\r\nthe newspaper head, told in the patent-medicine man's own words, as he\r\ndescribed it to his fellows. Is it pleasant reading for self-respecting\r\nnewspaper men--the exultant air of those last sentences, and the worldly\r\nwisdom: \"When you touch a man's pocket you touch him where he lives;\r\nthat principle is true of the newspaper editor...\"?\r\n\r\nBut the worst of this incident has not yet been told. There remains the\r\naccount of how the offending newspaper, in the language of the bully,\r\n\"ate dirt\". The Cleveland _Press_ is one of a syndicate of newspapers,\r\nall under Mr. McRae's ownership--but I will use Mr. Cooper's own words:\r\n\"We not only reached the Cleveland _Press_ by the movement taken up\r\nin that way, but went further, for the Cleveland _Press_ is one of a\r\nsyndicate of newspapers known as the Scripps-McRae League, from whom\r\nthis explanation is self-explanatory:\r\n\r\n\"'Office Schipps-McRae Press Association.\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. E. R. Cooper, Cleveland, Ohio:\r\n\r\n\"'Mr. McRae arrived in New York the latter part of last week after a\r\nthree months' trip to Egypt. I took up the matter of the recent cut-rate\r\narticles which appeared in the Cleveland _Press_ with him, and to-day\r\nreceived the following telegram from him from Cincinnati: 'Scripps-McRae\r\npapers will contain no more such as Cleveland _Press_ published\r\nconcerning the medicine trust--M. A. McRae.'\r\n\r\n\"'I am sure that in the future nothing will appear in the Cleveland Press\r\ndetrimental to your interests.\r\n\r\n\"'Yours truly,\r\n\r\n\"'F. J. Carlisle.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis incident was told, in the exact words above quoted, at the\r\nnineteenth annual meeting of the Proprietary Association of America.\r\n\r\nI could, if space permitted, quote many other telegrams and letters from\r\nthe Kilmer's Swamp Root makers, from the Piso's Cure people, from all\r\nthe large patent-medicine manufacturers. The same thing that happened\r\nin Massachusetts happened last year in New Hampshire, in Wisconsin,\r\nin Utah, in more than fifteen states. In Wisconsin the response by the\r\nnewspapers to the command of the patent-medicine people was even more\r\nhumiliating than in Massachusetts. Not only did individual newspapers\r\nwork against the formula bill; there is a \"Wisconsin Press\r\nAssociation,\" which includes the owners and editors of most of the\r\nnewspapers of the state. That association held a meeting and passed\r\nresolutions, \"that we are opposed to said bill... providing that\r\nhereafter all patent medicine sold in this state shall have the formula\r\nthereof printed on their labels,\" and \"Resolved, That the association\r\nappoint a committee of five publishers to oppose the passage of the\r\nmeasure.\" And in this same state the larger dailies in the cities took\r\nit on themselves to drum up the smaller country papers and get them\r\nto write editorials opposed to the formula bill. Nor was even this\r\nthe measure of their activity in response to the command of the patent\r\nmedicine association. I am able to give the letter which is here\r\nreproduced [see page 86]. {086} It was sent by the publisher\r\nof one of the largest daily papers in Wisconsin to the state senator\r\nwho {091}introduced the bill. In one western state, a board of health\r\nofficer made a number of analyses of patent medicines, and tried to have\r\nthe analyses made public, that the people of his state might be warned.\r\n\"Only one newspaper in the state,\" he says in a personal letter, \"was\r\nwilling to print results of these analyses, and this paper refused them\r\nafter two publications in which a list of about ten was published.\r\n\r\nIn New Hampshire--but space forbids. Happily there Is a little silver in\r\nthe situation. The legislature of North Dakota last year passed, and the\r\ngovernor signed a bill requiring that patent-medicine bottles shall\r\nhave printed on their labels the percentage of alcohol or of morphin or\r\nvarious other poisons which the medicine contains. That was the first\r\nsuccess in a fight which the public health authorities have waged\r\nin twenty states each year for twenty years. In North Dakota the\r\npatent-medicine people conducted the fight with their usual weapons,\r\nthe ones described above. But the newspapers, be it said to their\r\neverlasting credit, refused to fall in line to the threats of the\r\npatent-medicine association. And I account for that fact in this way:\r\nNorth Dakota is wholly a \"country\" community.\r\n\r\nIt has no city of over 20,000, and but one over 5,000. The press of the\r\nstate, therefore, consists of very small papers, weeklies, in which\r\nthe ownership and active management all lie with one man. The editorial\r\nconscience and the business manager's enterprise lie under one hat. With\r\nthem the patent-medicine scheme was not so successful as with the more\r\nelaborately organized newspapers of older and more populous states.\r\n\r\nJust now is the North Dakota editor's time of trial. The law went into\r\neffect July 1. The patent-medicine association, at their annual meeting\r\nin May, voted to withdraw all their advertising from all the papers in\r\nthat state. This loss of revenue, they argued self-righteously, would\r\nbe a warning to the newspapers of other states. Likewise it would be\r\na lesson to the newspapers of North Dakota. At the next session of the\r\nlegislature they will seek to have the label bill repealed, and they\r\ncount on the newspapers, chastened by a lean year, to help them. For the\r\nindependence they have shown in the past, and for the courage they will\r\nbe called on to show in the future, therefore, let the newspapers of\r\nNorth Dakota know that they have the respect and admiration of all\r\ndecent people.\r\n\r\n\"What is to be done about it?\" is the question that follows exposure of\r\norganized rascality. In few cases is the remedy so plain as here. For\r\nthe past, the newspapers, in spite of these plain contracts of silence,\r\nmust be acquitted of any very grave complicity. The very existence of\r\nthe machine that uses and directs them has been a carefully guarded\r\nsecret. For the future, be it understood that any newspaper which\r\ncarries a patent-medicine advertisement knows what it is doing. The\r\nobligations of the contract are now public property. And one thing more,\r\nwhen next a member of a state legislature arises and states, as I have\r\nso often heard: \"Gentlemen, this label bill seems right to me, but I can\r\nnot support it; the united press of my district is opposed to it\"--when\r\nthat happens, let every one understand the wires that have moved \"the\r\nunited press of my district.\" {092}\r\n\r\nThe Following are Extracts and Abstracts from Various Articles in the\r\nLadies Home Journal?\r\n\r\nA PECULIAR \"ETC.\"\r\n\r\nA great show of frankness was recently made by a certain \"patent\r\nmedicine.\" The makers advertised that they had concluded to take the\r\npublic into their confidence, and that thereafter they would print a\r\nformula of the medicine on each bottle manufactured.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing secretive about our medicine,\" was the cry. \"We have\r\nnothing to hide. Here is the formula. Show it to your physician.\"\r\n\r\nThen comes the formula: This herb and that herb, this ingredient\r\nand that ingredient, and the formula winds up, \"etc.\" All good,\r\nold-fashioned, well recognized drugs were those which were\r\nmentioned--all except the \"etc.\"\r\n\r\nA certain Board of Pharmacy had never heard of a drug called \"etc.,\" and\r\nso made up Its mind to find out.\r\n\r\nAnd the \"etc.\" was found to be 3.76 per cent of cocain!--just the\r\nsimple, death-dealing cocain!--From _The Ladies' Home Journal_,\r\nFebruary, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT MEDICINE CONCERNS AND LETTER BROKERS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most disgusting and disgraceful features of the patent\r\nmedicine business is the marketing of letters sent by patients to patent\r\nmedicine firms. Correspondence is solicited by these firms under the\r\nseal of sacred confidence. When the concern is unable to do further\r\nbusiness with a patient it disposes of the patient's correspondence to\r\na letter-broker, who, in turn, disposes of it to other patent medicine\r\nconcerns at the rate of half a cent, for each letter.\r\n\r\nThis Information was made public by Mark Sullivan in the _Ladies' Home\r\nJournal_ for January, 1906.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {092}\r\n\r\nAn advertisement showing how the names to orders sent to \"Patent\r\nMedicine\" concerns are offered for sale or rent to be used by others.\r\n\r\nYet we are told how \"Sacredly Confidential\" these letters are regarded\r\nand held. (The advertisement is from the _Mail Order Journal_, April,\r\n1905.)\r\n\r\nSays Mr. Sullivan: \"One of these brokers assured me he could give me\r\n'choice lots' of 'medical female letters'... Let me now give you, from\r\nthe printed lists of these 'letter brokers' some idea of the way in\r\nwhich these {093}'sacredly confidential' letters are hawked about the\r\ncountry. Here are a few samples, all that are really printable:\r\n\r\n\"'55,000 Female Complaint Letters' Is the sum total of one Item, and\r\nthe list gives the names of the \"medicine company\" or the \"medical\r\ninstitute\" to whom they were addressed. Here is a barter, then, in\r\n55,000 letters of a private nature, each one of which, the writer\r\nwas told, and had a right to expect, would be regarded as sacredly\r\nconfidential by the \"doctor\" or concern to whom she had been deluded\r\ninto telling her private ailments. Yet here they are for half a cent\r\neach!\r\n\r\n\"Another batch of some 47,000 letters addressed to five 'doctors' and\r\n'institutes' is emphasized because they were all written by women! A\r\nthird batch is:\r\n\r\n\"'44,000 Bust Developer Letters'--letters which one man in a \"patent\r\nmedicine\" concern told me were \"the richest sort of reading you could\r\nget hold of.\"\r\n\r\n\"A still further lot offers: '40,000 Women's Regulator Letters'--letters\r\nwhich in their context any woman can naturally imagine would be of the\r\nmost delicate nature. Still, the fact remains, here thy are for sale.\"\r\n\r\nIs not this contemptible?\r\n\r\nIn the same article Mr. Sullivan exposes the inhuman greed of patent\r\nmedicine concerns that turn into cold cash the letters of patients\r\nafflicted with the most vital diseases.\r\n\r\nTo quote Mr. Sullivan again: \"All these are made the subject of public\r\nbarter. Here are offered for sale, for example: 7,000 Paralysis Letters;\r\n9,000 Narcotic Letters; 52,000 Consumption Letters; 3,000 Cancer\r\nLetters, and even 65,000 Deaf Letters. Of diseases of the most private\r\nnature one is offered here nearly one hundred thousand letters--letters\r\nthe very classification of which makes a sensitive person shudder.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Appeal To The American Woman.\r\n\r\n\"If the American woman would withhold her patronage from these secret\r\nnostrums the greater part of the industry would go to pieces. I do\r\nnot ask any woman to take my word for this. Let me give her a personal\r\nstatement direct from one of these manufacturers himself--a 'doctor' to\r\nwhom thousands of women are writing to-day, and whose medicines they are\r\nbuying by the hundreds of thousands of bottles each year. I quote his\r\nown statement, word for word:\r\n\r\n\"'Men are \"on\" to the game; we don't care a damn about them. It is the\r\nwomen we are after. We have buncoed them now for a good many years, and\r\nso long as they remain as \"easy\" as they have been, and we can make them\r\nbelieve that they are sick, we're all right. Give us the women every\r\ntime. We can make them feel more female troubles In a year than they\r\nwould really have if they lived to be a hundred.' \".--From \"Why 'Patent\r\nMedicines' are Dangerous,\" Edward Bok, Ladies' Home Journal, March,\r\n1905.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"REPEATERS.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the \"repeat\" orders that make the profit. Referring to a certain\r\npatent medicine that had gone to the wall a nostrum agent said that It\r\nfailed because \"it wasn't a good repeater.\" When these men doubt whether\r\na new medicine will be a success they say: \"I'm afraid it wouldn't be a\r\n'repeater.'\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cure_ rheumatism\" said a veteran patent medicine man considering\r\nthe exploitation of a new remedy; \"good Heavens, man, you don't want a\r\nremedy that _cures_ 'em. Where would you get your 'repeats'? You want to\r\nget up a medicine that's full of dope, so the more they take of it the\r\nmore they'll want.\"--From \"The Inside Story of a Sham,\" _Ladies' Home\r\nJournal_, January, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATENT MEDICINES AND TESTIMONIALS.\r\n\r\nIn the January, 1906, issue of the _Ladies' Home Journal_ Mark Sullivan\r\ncontributes an article on the business of securing from well-known\r\npeople testimonials indorsing and praising nostrums. Mr. Sullivan\r\nlearned that three men, rivals in trade, make a business of securing\r\nthese indorsements. They are known as \"testimonlal-brokers.\"\r\n\r\nA representative of a patent medicine who was anxious to exploit his\r\npreparation through the press approached one of these brokers and made\r\narrangements for the delivery of one hundred signed testimonials from\r\nmembers of {094}congress, governors and men high in the Army and Navy.\r\nThe following is the memorandum of the agreement as drawn up by the\r\nbroker:\r\n\r\n\"Confirming my talk with Mr. ------, I will undertake to obtain\r\ntestimonials from senators at $75 each, and from congressmen at $40,\r\non a prearranged contract.... A contract for not less than $5,000 would\r\nmeet my requirements In the testimonial line.... I can put your\r\nmatter in good shape shortly after congress meets if we come to an\r\nagreement.... We can't get Roosevelt, but we can get men and women of\r\nnational reputation, and we can get their statements in convincing form\r\nand language...\"\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that years ago Mrs. Pinkham, at Lynn, Mass.,\r\ndetermined to step in and help her sex. Having had considerable\r\nexperience in treating female ills with her Vegetable Compound, she\r\nencouraged the women of America to write to her for advice in regard to\r\ntheir complaints, and being a woman, it was easy for help ailing sisters\r\nto pour into her ears every detail of their suffering.\r\n\r\nNo physician in the world has had such a training, or has such an amount\r\nof information at hand to assist in the treatment of all kinds of female\r\nills.\r\n\r\nThis, therefore, is the reason why Mrs. Pinkham, in her laboratory at\r\nLynn, Mass., Is able to do more for the ailing women, of America than\r\nthe family physician.' Any woman, therefore, is responsible for her own\r\nsuffering who will not take the trouble to write to Mrs. Pinkham for\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\n[IMAGE ==>] {094}\r\n\r\nThe way in which the testimonial is actually obtained is thus described\r\nby the broker:\r\n\r\n\"The knowing how to approach each individual is my stock-in-trade. Only\r\na man of wide acquaintance of men and things could carry it out. Often\r\nI employ women. Women know how to get around public men. For example,\r\nI know that Senator A has a poverty-stricken cousin, who works as a\r\nseamstress. I go to her and offer her twenty-five dollars to get the\r\nsenator's signature to a testimonial. But most of it I do through\r\nnewspaper correspondents here in Washington. Take the senator from\r\nsome southern state. That senator is very dependent on the Washington\r\ncorrespondent of the leading newspaper in his state. By the dispatches\r\nwhich that correspondent sends back the senator's career is made or\r\nmarred. So I go to that correspondent. I offer him $50 to get the\r\nsenator's testimonial. The senator may squirm, but he'll sign all right.\r\nThen there are a number of easy-going congressmen who needn't be seen at\r\nall. I can sign their names to anything, and they'll stand for it. And\r\nthere are always a lot of poverty-stricken, broken-down Army veterans\r\nhanging around Washington. For a few dollars they'll go to their old\r\nArmy officers on a basis of old acquaintance sake and get testimonials.\"\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that such testimonials are a fraud on the\r\npurchaser of the medicine thus exploited.\r\n\r\n\"Not one in a thousand of these letters ever reaches the eyes of the\r\n'doctor' to whom they are addressed. There wouldn't be hours enough in\r\nthe day to read them even if he had the desire. On the contrary, these\r\nletters from women of a private and delicate nature are opened and read\r\nby young men and girls; they go through not fewer than eight different\r\nhands before they reach a reply; each in turn reads them, and if there\r\nis anything 'spicy' you will see the heads of two or three girls get\r\ntogether and enjoy (!) the 'spice.' Very often these 'spicy bits' are\r\ntaken home and shown to the friends and families of these girls and men!\r\nTime and again have I seen this done; time and again have I been handed\r\nover a letter by one of the young fellows with the remark: 'Read this,\r\nisn't that rich?' only to read of the recital of some trouble into which\r\na young girl has fallen, or some mother's sacred story of her daughter's\r\nall!\r\n\r\n\"Then, to cap the climax of iniquity, with some of these houses these\r\nnames and addresses are sold at two, three or five cents a name to firms\r\nin other lines of business for the purpose of sending circulars. As\r\na fact, often the trouble is not taken to copy off the names and\r\naddresses, but the letters themselves, with all their private contents,\r\nare sold!\r\n\r\n\"This is the true story of the 'sacredly confidential' way in which\r\nthese private letters from women are treated!\"--Statement of a man who\r\nspent two years in the employ of a large patent medicine concern, as\r\ntold in \"How the Private Confidences of Women Are Laughed At.\" Edward\r\nBok, _Ladies' Home Journal,_ November, 1904.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Great American Fraud, by Samuel Hopkins Adams",
