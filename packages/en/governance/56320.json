The\r\nnecessity of strengthening the imperial ties between the old colonies\r\nand the mother country and reorganizing the new acquisitions came to\r\nthe forefront at this time and led the government into a course soon\r\nto end in the disruption of the empire. Certainly not the least of the\r\nquestions demanding solution was that of the disposition of the country\r\nlying to the westward of the colonies, including a number of French\r\nsettlements and a broad belt of Indian nations. It does not, however,\r\ncome within the proposed limits of this study to discuss all the\r\ndifferent phases of the western policy of England, except in so far as\r\nit may be necessary to make more clear her attitude towards the French\r\nsettlements in the Illinois country.\r\n\r\nThe European situation leading to the Seven Years War, which ended so\r\ndisastrously to French dominion, is too familiar to need repetition.\r\nThat struggle was the culmination of a series of continental and\r\ncolonial wars beginning towards the close of the seventeenth century\r\nand ending with the definitive treaty of 1763. During the first quarter\r\nof the century France occupied a predominating position among the\r\npowers. Through the aggressiveness of Louis XIV and his ministers\r\nher boundaries had been pushed eastward and westward, which seriously\r\nthreatened the balance of power on the continent. Until 1748 England\r\nand Austria had been in alliance against their traditional enemy, while\r\nin the Austrian Succession France had lent her aid to Prussia in the\r\ndismemberment of the Austrian dominions,—at the same time extending\r\nher own power in the interior of America and India. In the interval of\r\nnominal peace after the treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle in 1748, preparations\r\nwere begun for another contest. The astute diplomacy of Kaunitz won\r\nFrance from her traditional enmity and secured her as an open ally for\r\nMaria Theresa in her war of revenge.[1] While the European situation\r\nwas giving occasion for new alignments of powers, affairs in America\r\nwere becoming more and more important as between France and England.\r\nHere for over a century the two powers had been rivals for the\r\nterritorial and commercial supremacy.\r\n\r\nIn North America the pioneers had won for her the greater part of\r\nthe continent,—the extensive valleys of the St. Lawrence and the\r\nMississippi with all the land watered by their tributaries. The\r\nFrench claim to this region was based almost entirely upon discovery\r\nand exploration, for in all its extent less than one thousand\r\npeople were permanently settled. Canada at the north and the region\r\nabout New Orleans on the extreme south containing the bulk of the\r\npopulation, while throughout the old Northwest settlements were few and\r\nscattering.[2] Trading posts and small villages existed at Vincennes\r\non the Wabash River, at Detroit on a river of the same name, at\r\nSt. Joseph near Lake Michigan and other isolated places. Outside of\r\nDetroit, the most important and populous settlement was situated along\r\nthe eastern bank of the Mississippi, in the southwestern part of the\r\npresent state of Illinois. Here were the villages of Kaskaskia, St.\r\nPhillippe, Prairie du Rocher, Chartres village and Cahokia, containing\r\na population of barely two thousand people.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to this vast area of French territory and the sparseness\r\nof its population were the British colonies, with more than a million\r\npeople confined to the narrow strip between the Alleghany mountains and\r\nthe Atlantic ocean. These provinces were becoming comparatively crowded\r\nand many enterprising families of English, Scotch Irish, and German\r\nextraction were pushing westward towards the mountains. Each year saw\r\nthe pressure on the western border increased; the great unoccupied\r\nvalley of the Ohio invited homeseekers and adventurers westward in\r\nspite of hostile French and Indians. By the fifth decade the barriers\r\nwere being broken through by constantly increasing numbers, and the\r\nFrench found their possession of the West and their monopoly of the fur\r\ntrade seriously threatened.\r\n\r\nTo prevent such encroachments the French sought to bind their\r\npossessions together with a line of forts extending from the St.\r\nLawrence down the Ohio valley to the Gulf of Mexico. It had indeed been\r\nthe plan of such men as La Salle, Iberville, and Bienville to bring\r\nthis territory into a compact whole and limit the English colonies to\r\nthe line of mountains. New Orleans and Mobile gave France command of\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico and the Mississippi River; Louisburg, Niagara, and\r\nFrontenac afforded protection for Canada. The weak point for France was\r\nthe Ohio valley, in the upper part of which Virginia and Pennsylvania\r\nsettlers had already located. Celoron, who went down the Ohio in 1749,\r\nburying plates of lead to signify French dominion, warning English\r\nsettlers and traders, and persuading the Indians to drive out the\r\ninvaders of their hunting grounds, saw the inevitableness of the\r\nconflict. The American phase of the final struggle for colonial empire\r\nwas to begin in this region.[3]\r\n\r\nIn the early years of the war Great Britain and her ally met with\r\nserious reverses every where, and it seemed probable that France would\r\nbe able to hold her line of defense in America. The French colonies,\r\nhowever, were fundamentally weak. Being wholly dependent upon the\r\nmother country, when the latter became absorbed in the continental\r\nstruggle to the exclusion of her interests in her colonial possessions,\r\ndefeat was inevitable. By 1758 the tide was turning in America; this,\r\ntogether with the victories of Clive in India and Frederick the Great\r\nat Rossbach and Leuthen, started France on her downward road to ruin\r\nas a world power, and with the transference of the American struggle\r\nto Canada by the capture of Montreal and Quebec the war was at an end.\r\nIn 1762 the financial condition of France became so desperate that\r\nChoiseul was anxious for peace and he found George III and Lord Bute\r\nready to abandon their Prussian ally, and even to give up the fruits\r\nof some of the brilliant victories of 1762 which brought Spain to her\r\nknees.[4]\r\n\r\nThe definitive treaty of Paris was signed February 10, 1763,[5] by\r\nthe terms of which France ceded to Great Britain all of Canada and gave\r\nup her claim to the territory east of the Mississippi River, except the\r\ncity of New Orleans, adding to this the right of the free navigation of\r\nthe Mississippi. Spain received back Havana ceding Florida to England\r\nin return. A few weeks before signing the definitive treaty, France, in\r\na secret treaty with Spain ceded to her the city of New Orleans and the\r\nvast region stretching from the Mississippi towards the Pacific. Thus\r\nwas France divested of practically every inch of territory in America.\r\n\r\nThe French colony in the Illinois country had been originally\r\nestablished with the view of forming a connecting link between the\r\ncolonies in Louisiana on the south and Canada at the northeast. La\r\nSalle himself had recognized the possible strategic value of such\r\nan establishment from both a commercial and military standpoint.[6]\r\nBefore any settlements had even been made on the lower Mississippi,\r\nhe and his associates had attempted in 1682 the formation of a colony\r\non the Illinois River, near the present site of Peoria.[7] This the\r\nfirst attempt at western colonization was a failure. The opening of the\r\nfollowing century saw the beginning of a more successful and permanent\r\ncolony, when the Catholic missionaries from Quebec established their\r\nmissions at Kaskaskia and Cahokia,[8] near the villages of the Illinois\r\nIndians. They were soon followed by hunters and fur traders, and\r\nduring the first two decades of the eighteenth century a considerable\r\nnumber of families immigrated from Canada, thus assuring the permanancy\r\nof the settlement.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the contemporaneous colony of Louisiana had grown to some\r\nimportance, and in 1717, when the Company of the West assumed control\r\nof the province, the Illinois country was annexed. Prior to this time\r\nit had been within the jurisdiction of Quebec. This gave the Illinois\r\ncountry a period of prosperity, many new enterprizes being undertaken.\r\nShortly after its annexation to Louisiana, Pierre Boisbriant was given\r\na commission to govern the Illinois country, and among his instructions\r\nwas an order to erect a fort as a protection against possible\r\nencroachments from the English and Spanish. About 1720 Fort Chartres\r\nwas completed and became thereafter the seat of government during the\r\nFrench regime. In 1721 the Company of the West divided Louisiana into\r\nnine districts,[9] extending east and west of the Mississippi River\r\nbetween the lines of the Ohio and Illinois rivers. In 1732 Louisiana\r\npassed out of the hands of the Company of the West Indies, and,\r\ntogether with the Illinois dependency, became a royal province.[10] It\r\nremained in this status until the close of the Seven Years War. During\r\nthis period its relation with Louisiana had become economic as well as\r\npolitical, all of its trade being carried on through New Orleans, and\r\nthe southern colony often owed its existence to the large supplies of\r\nflour and pork sent down the river from the Illinois country.[11]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE OCCUPATION OF ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the treaty of Paris the title to the Illinois region passed to Great\r\nBritain, but Fort Chartres was not immediately occupied. Detachments\r\nof British troops had taken possession of practically every other post\r\nin the newly ceded territory as early as 1760. The occupation of the\r\nforest posts of Green Bay, Mackinac, St. Joseph, Ouitanon, Detroit,\r\nFort Miami, Sandusky, Niagara and others seemed to indicate almost\r\ncomplete British dominion in the West. The transfer of the Illinois\r\nposts, however, remained to be effected, and although orders were\r\nforwarded from France in the summer of 1763 to the officers commanding\r\nin the ceded territory to evacuate as soon as the English forces\r\nappeared,[12] almost three years elapsed before this was accomplished;\r\nfor soon after the announcement of the treaty of cession, that broad\r\nbelt of Indian tribes stretching from the fringe of the eastern\r\nsettlements to the Mississippi rose in open rebellion.[13] This\r\nunexpected movement had to be reckoned with before any thought of the\r\noccupation of the Illinois could be seriously entertained.\r\n\r\nOf the two great northern Indian families, the Iroquois had generally\r\nespoused the English cause during the recent war, while the Algonquin\r\nnations, living in Canada, and the Lake and Ohio regions, had supported\r\nthe French. At the close of the war the greater portion of the French\r\nhad sworn fealty to the English crown; but the allegiance of their\r\nallies, the Algonquins, was at best only temporary. It was thought\r\nthat, since the power of France had been crushed, there would be no\r\nfurther motive for the Indian tribes to continue hostilities; but from\r\n1761 there had been a growing feeling of discontent among the western\r\nIndians. So long as France and Great Britain were able to hold each\r\nother in check in America, the Indian nations formed a balance of\r\npower, so to speak, between them. England and France vied with each\r\nother to conciliate the savages and to retain their good will. As soon,\r\nhowever, as English dominion was assured, this attitude was somewhat\r\nchanged. The fur trade under the French had been well regulated, but\r\nits condition under the English from 1760 to 1763 was deplorable.[14]\r\nThe English traders were rash and unprincipled men[15] who did not\r\nscruple to cheat and insult their Indian clients at every opportunity.\r\nThe more intelligent of the western and northern Indians perceived\r\nthat their hunting grounds would soon be overrun by white settlers\r\nwith a fixed purpose of permanent settlement.[16] This was probably\r\nthe chief cause of the Indian uprising. There remained in the forests\r\nmany French and renegade traders and hunters who constantly concocted\r\ninsidious reports as to English designs and filled the savage minds\r\nwith hope of succor from the King of France.[17] Many of the French\r\ninhabitance had since 1760 emigrated beyond the Mississippi, because,\r\nas the Indians thought, they feared to live under English rule.[18]\r\nThis doubtless contributed something toward the rising discontent of\r\nthe savages. Finally the policy of economy in expenses, which General\r\nAmherst entered upon, by cutting off a large part of the Indian\r\npresents, always so indispensable in dealing with that race, augured\r\npoorly for the Indians's future.\r\n\r\nOn the part of the mass of the Indians the insurrection was probably\r\na mere outbreak of resentment; but Pontiac, the great chief of the\r\nOttawas, had a clearer vision. He determined to rehabilitate French\r\npower in the west and to reunite all the Indian nations into one great\r\nconfederacy in order to ward off the approaching dangers. During the\r\nyears 1761-1762 the plot was developed. In 1762 Pontiac dispatched\r\nhis emissaries to all the Indian nations. The ramifications of the\r\nconspiracy extended to all the Algonquin tribes, to some of the\r\nnations on the lower Mississippi and even included a portion of the\r\nSix Nations. The original aim of the plot was the destruction of the\r\ngarrisons on the frontier, after which the settlements were to be\r\nattacked. The attack on the outposts, beginning in May, 1763, was\r\nsudden and overwhelming; Detroit, Fort Pitt, and Niagara alone held\r\nout, the remainder of the posts falling without an attempt at defense.\r\nHad the proclamation of 1763, which aimed at the pacification of the\r\nIndians by reserving to them the western lands, been issued earlier\r\nin the year, this devastating might have been avoided. Peaceful\r\npacification was now out of the question. During the summers of 1763\r\nand 1764 Colonel Bouquet raised the siege of Fort Pitt, penetrated into\r\nthe enemy's country in the upper Ohio valley region and completely\r\nsubdued the Shawnee and Delaware tribes upon whom Pontiac had placed\r\nevery dependence. Previous to Bouquet's second campaign, Colonel\r\nBradstreet had advanced with a detachment along the southern shore of\r\nLake Erie, penetrating as far west as Detroit, whence companies were\r\nsent to occupy the posts in the upper lake region. In the campaign\r\nas a whole the Bouquet expedition was the most effective. After the\r\nratification of a series of treaties, in which the Indians promised\r\nallegiance to the English crown, the eastern portion of the rebellion\r\nwas broken.\r\n\r\nIt now remained to penetrate to the Illinois country in order to\r\nrelieve the French garrison. Pontiac had retired thither in 1764,\r\nafter his unsuccessful attempt upon Detroit; there he hoped to rally\r\nthe western tribes and sue for the support of the French. But as we\r\nshall see, his schemes received a powerful blow upon the refusal of the\r\ncommandants to countenance his pleas.\r\n\r\nTo what extent Pontiac was assisted by French intriguers in the\r\ndevelopment of his plans may never be positively known. As has already\r\nbeen pointed out, French traders were constantly among the Indians,\r\nfilling their minds with hopes and fears. That the plot included French\r\nofficials may be doubted; although Sir William Johnson and General\r\nGage seemed convinced that such was the case.[19] Their belief,\r\nhowever, was based almost wholly upon reports from Indian runners,\r\nwhose credibility as witnesses may well be questioned. A perusal of the\r\ncorrespondence of the French officials[20] residing in Illinois and\r\nLouisiana, and their official communications with the Indians during\r\nthis period goes far to clear them of complicity in the affair.[21]\r\n\r\nGeneral Gage, who succeeded Amherst as commander-in-chief of the\r\nBritish army in America in November, 1763, was convinced that the early\r\noccupation of the western posts was essential,[22] since it would in\r\na measure cut off the communication between the French and Indian\r\nnations dwelling in that vicinity. The Indians, finding themselves\r\nthus inclosed would be more easily pacified. But the participation in\r\nthe rebellion of the Shawnee and Delaware tribes of the upper Ohio\r\nriver region precluded for a time the possibility of reaching the\r\nMississippi posts by way of Fort Pitt, without a much larger force than\r\nGage had at his command in the east; and the colonies were already\r\navoiding the call for troops.[23] The only other available route\r\nwas by way of New Orleans and the Mississippi River whose navigation\r\nhad been declared open to French and English alike by the treaty of\r\nParis. Little opposition might be expected from the southern Indians\r\ntoward whom a much more liberal policy had been pursued than with the\r\nnorthern tribes. Presents to the value of four or five thousand pounds\r\nhad been sent to Charleston in 1763 for distribution among the southern\r\nnations which counter-acted in a large measure the machinations of the\r\nFrench traders from New Orleans.[24] The Florida ports, Mobile and\r\nPensacola, were already occupied by English troops, and Gage and his\r\nassociates believed, that with the co-operation of the French Governor\r\nof Louisiana a successful ascent could be made.[25]\r\n\r\nAccordingly in January, 1764, Major Arthur Loftus, with a detachment\r\nof three hundred and fifty-one men from the twenty-second regiment\r\nembarked at Mobile for New Orleans, where preparations were to be made\r\nfor the voyage.[26] A company of sixty men from this regiment were to\r\nbe left at Fort Massac on the Ohio River, while the remainder were to\r\noccupy Kaskaskia and Fort Chartres.[27] At New Orleans boats had to be\r\nbuilt, supplies and provisions procured, and guides and interpreters\r\nprovided.[28] The expedition set out from New Orleans February 27.\r\nThree weeks later the flotilla was attacked by a band of Tonica Indians\r\nnear Davion's Bluff, or Fort Adams,[29] about two hundred and forty\r\nmiles above New Orleans. After the loss of several men in the boats\r\ncomposing the vanguard, Loftus ordered a retreat, and the expedition\r\nwas abandoned. Depleted by sickness, death and desertion the regiment\r\nmade its way from New Orleans back to Mobile.[30]\r\n\r\nMajor Loftus placed the blame for the failure of his expedition upon\r\nGovernor D' Abadie and other French officials at New Orleans.[31] There\r\nis probably sufficient evidence, however, to warrant the conclusion\r\nthat his accusations against the Governor were without foundation.\r\nThe correspondence of D' Abadie, Gage, and others indicates that\r\nofficial aid was given the English in making their preparations for\r\nthe journey,[32] and letters were issued to the commandants of the\r\nFrench posts on the Mississippi to render the English convoys all the\r\nassistance in their power[33]. There may have been some justification\r\nfor the suspicion of Loftus that the intriguers were at work, for the\r\nFrench as a whole were not in sympathy with the attempt; the success\r\nof the English meant the cessation of the lucrative trade between New\r\nOrleans and Illinois. They were no doubt delighted at the discomfiture\r\nof the English officer, for when some of the chiefs engaged in the\r\nambuscade entered New Orleans they were said to have been publicly\r\nreceived.[34]\r\n\r\nGranting, however, the machinations of the French, the reason for\r\nthe failure of Loftus may be found in part in the almost total lack\r\nof precautions adopted before undertaking the journey. Governor D'\r\nAbadie had given the English officer warning of the bad disposition\r\nof a number of tribes along the Mississippi River, among whom Pontiac\r\nhad considerable influence, and had assured him that unless he carried\r\npresents for the Indians, he would be unable to proceed far up the\r\nriver.[35] The policy of sending advance agents with convoys of\r\npresents for the Indians was successful the following year when the\r\nIllinois posts were finally reached from the east; but no such policy\r\nwas adopted at this time.[36] No action was taken to counter-act any\r\npossible intrigues on the part of the French. D' Abadie's advice\r\nwas not heeded, and his prophecy was fulfilled. General Gage in his\r\nofficial correspondence implied that he did not think sufficient care\r\nhad been exercised to insure success, and expressed his belief that if\r\nLoftus would make use of the \"necessary precautions\" he might get up\r\nto the mouth of the Ohio with little interruption.[37] This want of\r\njudgement, therefore, accounts in a large degree for the unfortunate\r\ntermination of the plans of an approach from the south.\r\n\r\nThe news of the defeat of Loftus had two results. First, it gave\r\nPontiac renewed hope that he might be able to rally again the western\r\nand northern Indians, and, with French assistance, block the advance\r\nof the English. In the second place it led General Gage to determine\r\nupon an advance from the east, down the Ohio River, which was made\r\npracticable by the recent submission of the Delaware Indians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Illinois country in 1764 presented an anomalous\r\nsituation. St. Ange was governing, in the name of Louis XV, a country\r\nbelonging to another king. He was under orders to surrender the place\r\nas soon as possible to its rightful owner; but the prospect for such an\r\nevent seemed remote. He was surrounded by crowds of begging, thieving\r\nsavages; and the emissaries of the greatest of Indian chieftains,\r\nPontiac, were constantly petitioning for his active support against\r\nthe approaching English. A considerable portion of the French traders\r\nof the villages were secretly, and sometimes openly, supporting the\r\nIndian cause, which added greatly to the increasing embarrasment of the\r\ncommandant. So distressing became the situation that Neyon de Villiers,\r\nSt. Ange's predecessor, called the latter from Vincennes on the Wabash,\r\nand left the country in disgust, taking with him to New Orleans sixty\r\nsoldiers and eighty of the French inhabitants.[38] He had shortly\r\nbefore indignantly refused to countenance the proposals of Pontiac, and\r\nhad begged the Indians to lay down their arms and make peace with the\r\nEnglish.[39]\r\n\r\nThe news of Loftus' defeat aroused Pontiac the thought of the\r\npossibility of meeting and repelling the advance from the east as\r\nit had been met and repelled in the south. In spite of the news of\r\nthe defeat of his allies by Bouquet and the report that preparations\r\nwere being made by his victorious enemy to advance against him,\r\nPontiac determined to make a last supreme effort. By a series of\r\nvisits among the tribes dwelling in the Illinois, on the Wabash and\r\nin the Miami country, he succeeded in arousing in them the instinct\r\nof self-preservation, in firing the hearts of all the faltering\r\nIndians and in winning the promise of their co-operation in his plan\r\nof defense. He was in this temper when he met and turned back Captain\r\nThomas Morris in the Miami country early in the autumn of 1764. Morris\r\nhad been sent by Bradstreet from the neighborhood of Detroit with\r\nmessages to St. Ange in the Illinois country, whence he was to proceed\r\nto New Orleans.[40] After being maltreated and threatened with the\r\nstake, Morris effected an escape and made his way to Detroit.[41] It\r\nwas during his interview with Pontiac that the latter informed Morris\r\nof the repulse of Loftus, of the journey of his emissaries to New\r\nOrleans to seek French support, and of his determination and that of\r\nhis Indian allies to resist the English to the last.[42]\r\n\r\nA few months later, in February, 1765, there arrived at Fort Chartres\r\nan English officer, accompanied by a trader named Crawford. They were\r\nprobably the first Englishmen to penetrate thus far into the former\r\nFrench territory since the beginning of the war.[43] They had been sent\r\nfrom Mobile by Major Farmer, the commandant at that place, to bring\r\nabout the conciliation of the Indians in the Illinois.[44] Instead of\r\nfollowing the Mississippi, they worked their way northward through the\r\ngreat Choctaw and Chicksaw nations to the Ohio, descended the latter\r\nto the Mississippi and thence to the Illinois villages.[45] Although\r\nSt. Ange received them cordially[46] and did all in his power to\r\ninfluence the savages to receive the English,[47] the mission of Ross\r\nwas a failure. The Indians had nothing but expressions of hatred and\r\ndefiance for the English; even the Missouri and Osages from beyond\r\nthe Mississippi had fallen under the influence of Pontiac.[48] Ross\r\nand his companion remained with St. Ange nearly two months; but about\r\nthe middle of April they were obliged to go down the river to New\r\nOrleans.[49]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1764-1765 preparations were made to send a\r\ndetachment of troops down the Ohio from Fort Pitt to relieve Fort\r\nChartres. To pave the way for the troops Gage dispatched two agents\r\nin advance. He selected George Croghan, Sir William Johnson's deputy,\r\nfor the delicate and dangerous task of going among the Indians of\r\nthat country to assure them of the peaceful attitude of the English,\r\nto promise them better facilities for trade and to accompany the\r\npromise with substantial presents.[50] The second agent was Lieutenant\r\nFraser,[51] whose mission was to carry letters to the French commandant\r\nand a proclamation for the inhabitants.[52] January 24, 1765, Fraser\r\nand Croghan set out from Carlisle, Pennsylvania,[53] followed a few\r\ndays later by a large convoy of presents.[54] During the journey, the\r\nconvoy was attacked by a band of Pennsylvania borderers,[55] and a\r\nlarge part of the goods destined for the Indians were destroyed,[56]\r\ntogether with some valuable stores which certain Philadelphia merchants\r\nwere forwarding to Fort Pitt for the purpose of opening up the trade\r\nas early as possible.[57] Croghan therefore found it necessary to\r\ntarry at Fort Pitt to replenish his stores and to await the opening of\r\nspring.[58] But another matter intervened which forced him to postpone\r\nhis departure for more than two months. A temporary defection had\r\narisen among the Shawnee and Delaware Indians.[59] They had failed to\r\nfulfil some of the obligations imposed upon them by Bouquet in the\r\nprevious summer, and there was some fear lest they would not permit\r\nCroghan to pass through their country. His influence was such, however,\r\nthat, in an assembly of the tribes at Fort Pitt, he not only received\r\ntheir consent to a safe passage, but some of their number volunteered\r\nto accompany him.[60]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Lieutenant Fraser, Croghan's companion, decided to proceed\r\nalone, inasmuch as Gage's instructions to him were to be at the\r\nIllinois early in April.[61] On March 23 he departed, accompanied\r\nby two or three whites and a couple of Indians,[62] and reached the\r\nIllinois posts in the latter part of April, shortly after the departure\r\nof Lieutenant Ross and his party. Here Fraser found many of the\r\nIndians in destitution and some inclined for peace.[63] Nevertheless,\r\ninstigated by the traders and encouraged by their secret supplies,\r\nthe savages as a whole would not listen to Fraser; they threatened\r\nhis life, and threw him into prison, and he was finally saved by the\r\nintervention of Pontiac himself.[64] Fraser felt himself to be in a\r\ndangerous situation; unable to hear from Croghan, whom he was expecting\r\nevery day, and daily insulted and maltreated by the drunken savages,\r\nhe took advantage of his discretionary orders and descended the\r\nMississippi to New Orleans.[65] Although the French traders continued\r\nto supply the Indians with arms and ammunition, and buoy up their\r\nspirits by stories of aid from the king of France, Pontiac himself\r\nwas being rapidly disillusioned. He had given Fraser the assurance that\r\nif the Indians on the Ohio had made a permanent peace, he would do\r\nlikewise.[66] St. Ange continued to refuse the expected help,[67] and\r\nwhen the news came of the failure of the mission to New Orleans and of\r\nthe transfer of Louisiana to Spain, the ruin of the Indian cause was\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nHaving adjusted affairs with the Indians at Fort Pitt, Croghan set out\r\nfrom there on May 15th with two boats, accompanied by several white\r\ncompanions and a party of Shawnee Indians.[68] In compliance with\r\nmessages from Croghan, representatives of numerous tribes along the\r\nroute met him at the mouth of the Scioto and delivered up a number of\r\nFrench traders who were compelled to take an oath of allegiance to\r\nthe English crown, or pass to the west of the Mississippi.[69] The\r\nonly other incident of importance on this voyage was the attack of\r\nthe Kickapous and Mascoutin Indians near the mouth of the Wabash on\r\nJune 8th,[70] which contributed greatly to the success of the mission.\r\nAfter the attack in which two whites and several Shawnees were killed,\r\nthe assailants expressed their profound sorrow, declaring that they\r\nthought the party to be a band of Charokees with whom they were at\r\nenmity.[71] Nevertheless, they plundered the stores and carried Croghan\r\nand the remainder of the party to Vincennes, a small French town on\r\nthe Wabash. Croghan was now separated temporarily from his companions\r\nand carried to Fort Ouiatanon, about 210 miles north of Vincennes. The\r\npolitical blunder of the Kickapous in firing upon the convoy now became\r\napparent;[72] they were censured on all sides for having attacked\r\ntheir friends the Shawnees, since the latter might thus be turned into\r\ndeadly enemies.[73] During the first week of July deputations from all\r\nthe surrounding tribes visited Croghan, assuring him of their desire\r\nfor peace and of their willingness to escort him to the Illinois where\r\nPontiac was residing.[74] July 11th, Maisonville, whom Fraser had a\r\nfew weeks before left at Fort Chartres, arrived at Ouiatanon with\r\nmessages from St. Ange requesting Croghan to come to Fort Chartres to\r\narrange affairs in that region.[75] A few days later Croghan set out\r\nfor the Illinois, attended by a large concourse of savages; but he had\r\nadvanced only a short distance when he met Pontiac himself who was on\r\nthe road to Ouiatanon. They all returned to the fort where, at a great\r\ncouncil, Pontiac signified his willingness to make a lasting peace and\r\npromised to offer no further resistance to the approach of the English\r\ntroops.[76] There was now no need to go to Fort Chartres; instead\r\nCroghan turned his steps toward Detroit, where another important Indian\r\nconference was held in which a general peace was made with all the\r\nwestern Indians.[77]\r\n\r\nImmediately after effecting an accomodation with Pontiac at Ouiatanon,\r\nCroghan sent an account of the success of his negotiations to Fort\r\nPitt.[78] Here Captain Stirling with a detachment of about one hundred\r\nmen of the 42d or Black Watch regiment, had been holding himself in\r\nreadiness for some time, waiting for a favorable report before moving\r\nto the relief of Fort Chartres. Although the 34th regiment under Major\r\nFarmer was supposed to be making its way up the Mississippi to relieve\r\nthe French garrison in Illinois, General Gage would not depend upon\r\nits slow and uncertain movements.[79] Upon receipt of the news, on the\r\n24th of August, Stirling left Fort Pitt[80] and began the long and\r\ntedious journey. Owing to the season of the year the navigation of the\r\nOhio was very difficult, forty-seven days being required to complete\r\nthe journey.[81] The voyage, on the whole, was without incident until\r\nabout forty miles below the Wabash River. Here Stirling's force\r\nencountered two boats loaded with goods, in charge of a French trader,\r\nwho was accompanied by some thirty Indians and a chief of the Shawnees,\r\nwho had remained in the French interest.[82] On account of the\r\nallegations of a certain Indian that his party had planned to fire on\r\nthe English before they were aware of the latters' strength, Stirling\r\nbecame apprehensive lest the attitude of the Indians had changed since\r\nCroghan's visit. He therefore sent Lieutenant Rumsey, with a small\r\nparty by land from Fort Massac to Fort Chartres, in order to ascertain\r\nthe exact situation and to apprise St. Ange of his approach.[83] Rumsey\r\nand his guides, however, lost their way and did not reach the villages\r\nuntil after the arrival of the troops.[84] Sterling arrived on the 9th\r\nof October; and it is said that the Indians and French were unaware of\r\nhis approach until he was within a few miles of the village, and that\r\nthe Indians upon learning of the weakness of the English force, assumed\r\na most insolent and threatening attitude.[85] On the following day St.\r\nAnge and the French garrison were formally relieved,[86] and with this\r\nevent, the last vestige of French authority in North America, except\r\nnew Orleans, passed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSTATUS OF THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY IN THE EMPIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore entering upon the more detailed study of events in the Illinois\r\ncountry during the period of the British occupation, it is necessary\r\nto take into consideration certain general aspects of the subject\r\nwhich will enable us to understand more clearly the bearing of those\r\nevents. The relation of that country to the empire and the view held\r\nby British statesmen of the time relative to its status are problems\r\nwhich naturally arise and demand solution. What was the nature of the\r\ngovernment imposed upon the French in Illinois after its occupation? Is\r\nthe hitherto prevailing opinion that the British government placed the\r\ninhabitants of those villages under a military government any longer\r\ntenable? Was the government de jure or de facto?\r\n\r\nThe treatment received by the settlements in the Northwest and West\r\nin general was fundamentally different in nature from that accorded\r\nother portions of the new empire. By the terms of the Proclamation\r\nof 1763,[87] civil governments were created for the provinces of\r\nQuebec, East Florida, West Florida, and Grenada, while all the western\r\nterritory outside the prescribed limits of those colonies, including\r\na large portion of southern Canada of today, was reserved as a vast\r\nhunting ground for the Indian nations. No mention whatsoever is made\r\nin the Proclamation concerning the settled portions of the West and\r\nsince it is, therefore, impossible to ascertain in this document their\r\ngovernmental status, we will examine the official correspondence of the\r\nministry which immediately proceeded the issuance of the Proclamation\r\nto find, if possible, what the directors of the British colonial policy\r\nhad in mind.\r\n\r\nWhen the question of the Proclamation was under discussion by the\r\nMinistry in the summer of 1763, two opposing views with reference\r\nto the West were for a time apparent in the ministry. It appears to\r\nhave been the policy of Lord Egremont, at that time Secretary for the\r\nSouthern Department, which included the management of the colonies, to\r\nplace the unorganized territory within the jurisdiction of some one of\r\nthe colonies possessing a settled government, preferably Canada.[88]\r\nIt was at least his aim to give to the Indian country sufficient\r\ncivil supervision so that criminals and fugitives from justice from\r\nthe colonies might be taken. That he did not intend to extend civil\r\ngovernment to the villages or any of the French inhabitants of the\r\nWest seems clear: his only reference is to the \"Indian country\" and to\r\n\"criminals\" and \"fugitives from justice.\"\r\n\r\nLord Shelburne, President of the Board of Trade and a member of the\r\nGrenville ministry, and his colleagues were of the opinion that the\r\nannexation of the West to Canada might lend color to the idea that\r\nEngland's title to the West came from the French cession, when in\r\nfact her claim was derived from other sources; that the inhabitants\r\nof the province to which it might be annexed would have too\r\ngreat an advantage in the Indian trade; and finally that such an\r\nimmense province could not be properly governed without a large\r\nnumber of troops and the governor would thus virtually become a\r\ncommander-in-chief.[89] Shelburne then announced his plan of giving\r\nto the commanding general of the British army in America jurisdiction\r\nover the West for the purpose of protecting the Indians and the fur\r\ntrade.[90] Lord Halifax, who succeeded to Egermont's position at the\r\nlatter's death in August, 1763, fell in with Shelburne's views. But\r\nthe commission to the commanding general does not appear to have been\r\nissued; for Hillsborough, who succeeded Shelburne as President of the\r\nBoard of Trade in the autumn of 1763, favored a different policy. There\r\nis nothing, however, to indicate that Shelburne and his advisers had\r\nany thought of the government of the French colonies. There is no hint\r\nin any of this correspondence that the ministry had any idea of the\r\nexistence of the several thousand French inhabitants of the West.[91]\r\n\r\nThere remain one or two documents in which we might expect to find some\r\nreference to the government of the French settlers. The authors of that\r\npart of the Proclamation of 1763 which provided for the reservation\r\nof the Indian lands and the regulation of the trade,[92] had in\r\ncontemplation the formation of an elaborate plan comprehending the\r\nmanagement of both in the whole of British North America.[93] It was\r\nleft to Hillsborough, Shelburne's successor as President of the Board\r\nof Trade, to direct the formulation of the plan, which was finished\r\nin 1764. The details of this program will be taken up in a later\r\nchapter,[94] and it will therefore suffice to note the presence or\r\nabsence of any provisions for the French. The chief object of the plan\r\nseems to have been to bring about a centralization in the regulation\r\nof the trade and the management of the Indians, and in no place is\r\nthere any intimation that its provisions have any application to the\r\ngovernment of the French residing at the various posts.[95]\r\n\r\nTurning to another source we find a document addressed directly to the\r\ninhabitants of the Illinois country, dated in New York, December 30,\r\n1764 and signed by General Thomas Gage.[96] Mention has already been\r\nmade in another connection of the unsuccessful mission of Lieutenant\r\nFraser to Illinois in the spring of 1765, when he carried this\r\nproclamation to the inhabitants. But its contents were not announced\r\nuntil the entry of Captain Sterling in October of that year. This\r\nproclamation related solely to guarantees by the British government\r\nof the right of the inhabitants under the treaty of Paris: freedom of\r\nreligion, the liberty of removing from or remaining within English\r\nterritory and the requirements as to taking the oath of allegiance made\r\nup its contents. As to whether the inhabitants were to enjoy a civil\r\ngovernment or be ruled by the army there is no intimation.\r\n\r\nLaying aside the barren papers of 1763-1765 and giving attention to the\r\ndocumentary material after those dates proves much more productive.\r\nWe are thereby enabled to arrive at some pretty definite conclusions.\r\nFortunately there were a few men in authority during that period who\r\nhad some interest in the interior settlements, and who, from their\r\nofficial positions realized the difficulties of the problem. Such\r\nmen have left expressions of opinion and stray bits of information\r\nwhich leave us in little doubt as to the governmental status of the\r\nIllinois country. General Thomas Gage, Sir William Johnson, and Lord\r\nHillsborough are perhaps the most representative examples. Gage, who\r\nwas commander-in-chief of the American army throughout this period,\r\nwith headquarters in New York City, was in direct communication both\r\nwith his subordinates in Illinois and the home authorities. He was in\r\na position to know, in general, the state of affairs in the West\r\nas well as to keep in touch with ministerial opinion. Sir William\r\nJohnson, by virtue of his office as Superintendent of Indian affairs\r\nfor the northern district, was in a peculiarly strategic position\r\nto acquire information. His Indian agents were stationed at all the\r\nwestern posts and he was in constant correspondence with the Board of\r\nTrade relative to Indian and trade conditions. From the ministry itself\r\nthe correspondence of Lord Hillsborough best reflects the prevailing\r\nopinion of the government. He was one of the few governmental\r\nauthorities who took any considerable interest in the western problem\r\nand information coming from him must, therefore, have some weight.\r\n\r\nThat the British commandant of the fort in the Illinois country had no\r\ncommission to govern the inhabitants, except perhaps that power, which,\r\nin the absence of all other authority, naturally devolves upon the\r\nmilitary officer, seems amply clear from a recommendation transmitted\r\nby General Gage to his superior shortly after the occupation of Fort\r\nde Chartres. \"If I may presume to give my opinion further on this\r\nmatter, I would humbly propose that a Military Governor should be\r\nappointed for the Ilinois (sic) as soon as possible. The distance of\r\nthat Country from any of the Provinces being about 1400 Miles, making\r\nits Dependance upon any of them impractical, and for its Vicinity to\r\nthe French Settlements, no other than a Military Government would\r\nanswer our purpose.\"[97] In the following year he took a similar point\r\nof view in a communication to his co-laborer in America: \"I am quite\r\nsensible of the irregular behavior of the Traders and have intimated to\r\nhis Majesty's Secretary of State what I told the Board of Trade four\r\nor five years ago: That they must be restrained by Law, and a Judicial\r\nPower invested in the officer Commanding at the Posts to see such Law\r\nput in force. And without this, Regulations may be made, but they will\r\nnever be observed.\"[98]\r\n\r\nWith the condition of comparative anarchy in the Illinois country\r\nduring this period and indeed at all the western posts and throughout\r\nthe Indian country the authorities seemed unable to combat\r\nsuccessfully. Had all the regulations outlined in the plan for the\r\nmanagement of Indian affairs,[99] been put into operation the Indian\r\ndepartment would have been able to cope more successfully with that\r\nphase of the situation. But neither military nor Indian departments had\r\nlegal authority to take any action whatsoever. As Johnson, in speaking\r\nof his inability to handle the situation for lack of sufficient power,\r\ndeclared in 1767 that \"the authority of commissaries is nothing, and\r\nboth the Commanding Officers of Garrisons and they, are liable to\r\na civil prosecution for detaining a Trader on any pretence.\"[100]\r\nProbably more emphatic still the commanding general four years later\r\nin writing of the disturbances, said: \"And I perceive there has been\r\nwanting judicial powers to try and determine. There has been no way\r\nto bring Controversys & Disputes properly to a determination or\r\ndelinquenents to punishment.\"[101]\r\n\r\nThere is probably some justification for the current belief that the\r\ngovernment placed the inhabitants under a military rule, inasmuch as\r\nthe actual government proved in the last analysis to be military.\r\nBut that the British ministry consciously attached the interior\r\nsettlements to the military department is far from the truth. Such a\r\nsystem was probably contemplated by no one, particularly between the\r\nyears 1763 and 1765 when the re-organization of the new acquisitions\r\nwas under discussion. The greater part of the new territory was the\r\nseat of the fur trade and the desire for the development of that\r\nindustry controlled in the main the policy of the ministry relative\r\nto the disposition of the peltry districts and the interests of the\r\nsettlements were completely ignored. Secretary Hillsborough, who\r\nhelped formulate the western policy in 1763 and 1764 doubtless gave\r\nthe most adequate explanation when in 1769, he wrote: \"With regard to\r\nthe Posts in the interior Country considered in another view in which\r\nseveral of your letters have placed them; I mean as to the settlements\r\nformed under their protection, which, not being included within the\r\njurisdiction of any other Colony are exposed to many Difficulties\r\n& Disadvantages from the Want of some Form of Government necessary\r\nto Civil Society, it is very evident that, if the case of these\r\nSettlements had been well known or understood at the time of forming\r\nthe conquered Lands into Colonies, some provision would have been\r\nmade for them, & they would have been erected into distinct Governments\r\nor made dependent upon those Colonies of which they were either the\r\noffspring, or with which they did by circumstances and situation, stand\r\nconnected. I shall not fail, therefore, to give this matter the fullest\r\nconsideration when the business of the Illinois Country is taken\r\nup.\"[102]\r\n\r\nThat the occupation of Fort Chartres became anything more than\r\ntemporary was due to the necessity of being prepared to crush a\r\npossible uprising of the savages and to repel the constant invasion of\r\nthe French and Spanish traders[103] from beyond the Mississippi, whose\r\ninfluence over the Indians, it was feared, would be detrimental to the\r\npeace of the empire. In its policy of retrenchment owing to the trouble\r\nwith the colonies, the government at various times contemplated the\r\nwithdrawal of the troops, but each time the detachment was allowed to\r\nremain the sole reason given was to guard that portion of the empire\r\nagainst the French and Indians.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this inquiry relative to the legal status of Illinois\r\nno mention has been made of the extension or non-extension of English\r\nlaw and custum to the West after its cession. This is one of the more\r\nimportant general aspects of the western problem and deserves some\r\nattention inasmuch as it may throw some light on the legal position of\r\nthe settlements. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the\r\ngreat era of English colonization, the necessity of fixing definitely\r\nthe legal status of the colonies called forth a series of judicial\r\nopinions and legal commentaries; it is to these we have to look to\r\ndetermine the theory held regarding the application of English law\r\nto the colonies and particularly to conquered provinces. In general\r\nit may be said that Blackstone represents the usual view taken by\r\njurists during these two centuries. In his commentaries published in\r\n1765 he declared that \"in conquered or ceded countries, that have\r\nalready laws of their own, the king may indeed alter and change those\r\nlaws, but till he actually does change them, the ancient laws of the\r\ncountry remain.[104]\" This opinion is supported by the authority of\r\nLord Mansfield in his decision in the case of Campbell vs Hall,[105]\r\nrendered in 1774, which involved the status of the island of Granada, a\r\nconquered province. He laid down in this decision the general principle\r\nthat the \"laws of a conquered country continue in force until they are\r\naltered by the conquerer. The justice and antiquity of this maxim are\r\nincontrovertible:——\"[106]\r\n\r\nThe Proclamation of 1763 which had definitely extended the laws of\r\nEngland to the new provinces,[107] made no such provisions for the\r\nWest, nor did the crown ever take such action. We may, therefore, lay\r\ndown the general principle that the British Government was obliged\r\nto govern her new subjects in this region according to the laws\r\nand customs hitherto prevailing among them; any other course would\r\nmanifestly be illegal. The commanding general of the army in America\r\nand his subordinates, who were embarrassed by the presence of this\r\nFrench settlement for which no provision had been made by the ministry,\r\nand who found it necessary to assume the obligation of enforcing some\r\nsort of order in that country, had no power to displace any of the\r\nlaws and customs of the French inhabitants. It will be pointed out in\r\nsucceeding chapters that this general principle, while adhered to in\r\nmany respects, was not uniformly carried out.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the foregoing considerations that the government\r\nof the Illinois people was de facto in nature. It had no legal\r\nfoundations. Every action of the military department was based on\r\nexpediency; although this course was in general acquiesced in by the\r\nhome authorities, all the officials concerned were aware that such a\r\nstatus could not continue indefinitely. But it did continue for about a\r\ndecade, during which time the inhabitants were at the mercy of some six\r\nor seven different military commandants. In 1774, however, Parliament\r\npassed the Quebec Act, which provided, among other things, for the\r\nunion of all the western country north of the Ohio River, and which but\r\nfor the cataclysm of the American revolution meant civil government for\r\nthe whole region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTRADE CONDITIONS IN ILLINOIS, 1765-1775.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peltry trade had been one of the elements which had accentuated,\r\nthroughout the eighteenth century, the difficulties between France and\r\nEngland in the Ohio and Mississippi valleys. It was the chief support\r\nof the French government in Canada and now that the English were in\r\nundisputed possession of the great peltry districts it became apparent\r\nthat the management of the trade deserved most serious consideration.\r\nIt was becoming of increasing importance to the manufacturing monopoly\r\nof the mother country, and therefore, in the minds of English\r\nstatesmen, deserved far more attention than did the few thousand French\r\ncolonists scattered throughout the West. The desire to increase this\r\nbranch of commerce dictated in a large measure those clauses in the\r\nProclamation of 1763 which forbade the formation of settlements or the\r\npurchase of lands within the Indian reservation, but at the same time\r\ndeclared that the trade with the Indians should be free and open to\r\nall English subjects alike. Again, the plan proposed in 1764 related\r\nsolely to the management of the Indians and to the regulation of the\r\ntrade with a view to making the English monopoly of intrinsic value to\r\nthe empire. Even towards the close of the period under consideration\r\nthere is little or no change of policy so far as official utterances\r\nare concerned. In 1772 in a report to the crown, the Lords of Trade\r\nmade the following declaration: \"The great object of colonization upon\r\nthe continent of North America has been to improve and extend the\r\ncommerce and manufactures of this kingdom. It does appear to us that\r\nthe extension of the fur trade depends entirely upon the Indians being\r\nundisturbed in the possession of their hunting grounds, and that all\r\ncolonization does in its nature and must in its consequence operate to\r\nthe prejudice of that branch of commerce. Let the savages enjoy their\r\ndeserts in quiet. Were they driven from their forests the peltry trade\r\nwould decrease.\"[108]\r\n\r\nUnder the French regime the western Indians and their trade had been\r\nmanaged with greater success than had the tribes living under English\r\ninfluence. The success of France was due largely to her policy of\r\ncentralization combined of course with the genial character of the\r\nFrench fur trader and the influence of the missionary. The English,\r\non the contrary, had managed their relations with the Indians through\r\nthe agency of the different colonies, without a semblance of union or\r\nco-operation: each colony competed for the lion's share of the trade, a\r\npolicy which resulted disastrously to the peace of the empire.\r\n\r\nIn 1755 the English government under the influence of Halifax,\r\npresident of the Board of Trade, took over the political control of\r\nthe Indians, and superintendents were appointed by the crown to reside\r\namong the different nations.[109] A little later in 1761 the purchase\r\nof Indian lands was taken out of the hands of the colonies and placed\r\nunder the control of the home government.[110] No further change is\r\nto be noted until after the issue of the war was known, when the\r\nwhole question was taken under consideration. The most important step\r\nyet taken respecting the Indian and his concomitant, the fur trade,\r\nappeared in the Proclamation of 1763, issued in October following the\r\ntreaty of cession. Some of its provisions for the West have already\r\nbeen noted. In addition to reserving for the present the unorganized\r\nterritory between the Alleghany mountains and the Mississippi River\r\nfor the use of the Indians, the government guaranteed the Indians\r\nin the possession of those lands by announcing in the Proclamation\r\nthat no Governor or Commander-in-chief would be allowed to make land\r\ngrants within their territory, and further all land purchases and\r\nthe formation of settlements by private individuals without royal\r\nconsent were prohibited. Trade within this reservation was made,\r\nhowever, free to all who should obtain a license from the Governor or\r\nCommander-in-chief of the colony in which they resided.[111]\r\n\r\nThe policy was now for the central government to take the Indian\r\ntrade under its management; and in the course of the year following\r\nthe issuance of the Proclamation an elaborate plan was outlined by\r\nHillsborough[112] comprehending the political and commercial relations\r\nwith all the Indian territory.\r\n\r\nAccording to the proposed scheme[113] British North America was to be\r\ndivided, for the purpose of Indian management, into two districts,\r\na northern and a southern, each under the control of a general\r\nsuperintendent or agent appointed by the crown: the Ohio River being\r\ndesignated as the approximate line of division. In the northern\r\ndistrict, with which we are here concerned, the regulation of such\r\nIndian affairs as treaties, land purchases, questions of peace and\r\nwar, and trade relations were to be given into the hands of the\r\nsuperintendent who was to be entirely free from outside interference:\r\nwithout his consent no civil or military officer could interfere with\r\nthe trade or other affairs of any of the Indian tribes. Three deputies\r\nwere to be appointed to assist the superintendent and at each post a\r\ncommissary, an interpreter, and a smith were to reside, acting under\r\nthe immediate direction of the superintendent and responsible only\r\nto him for their conduct. For the administration of justice between\r\ntraders and Indians and between traders themselves, the commissary\r\nat each post was to be empowered to act as justice of the peace in\r\nall civil and criminal cases. In civil cases involving sums not\r\nexceeding ten pounds an appeal might be taken to the superintendent.\r\nThe Indian trade was to be under the direct supervision of the general\r\nsuperintendent. Traders who desired to go among the Indians to ply\r\ntheir trade could do so by obtaining a license from the province from\r\nwhich they came. The region into which the trader intended to go was\r\nto be clearly defined in the license and each had to give bond for\r\nthe observance of the laws regulating the trade. The superintendent,\r\ntogether with the commissary at the post and a representative of the\r\nIndians were to fix the value of all goods and traders were forbidden\r\nto charge more than the price fixed; for the still better regulation\r\nof the trade, it was to be centered about the regularly fortified and\r\ngarrisoned forts. Regulations for the sale of land were also proposed;\r\noutside the limits of the colonies no individual or company could\r\nlegally purchase land from the Indians unless at a general meeting of\r\nthe tribe presided over by the superintendent.\r\n\r\nThe plan thus outlined by the ministry was never legally carried into\r\neffect, although the superintendents used the outline as a guide in\r\ntheir dealings with the Indians. The original intention had been to\r\nlevy a tax on the Indian trade to defray the expense of putting the\r\nscheme into operation, but it was found that the budget was already too\r\ngreatly burdened; and the Stamp Act disturbance which soon followed\r\nillustrated the possible inexpediency of imposing such a duty.[114]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing considerations serve to indicate the importance the\r\nministry attached to the Indian trade in general. But what of the\r\ntrade in the Illinois country? This region had been one of the great\r\ncenters of the Indian trade under the French regime; and, in addition,\r\nthe French inhabitants had been one of the main supports of New\r\nOrleans since its foundation early in the century. The commercial\r\nconnection between the Illinois villages and New Orleans had never been\r\nbroken, and at the time of the occupation of Illinois in 1765 French\r\nfur traders and merchants still plied their traffic up and down the\r\nMississippi River. Now that the title to this trade center passed to\r\nEngland it was expected that the volume of trade would be turned\r\neastward from its southerly route. The necessity for this was patent if\r\nany solid benefits were to accrue to the empire from the cession.[115]\r\n\r\nThe home and colonial authorities early saw the importance of the\r\nredirection of the trade. They hoped and expected that a trade would be\r\nopened with the Indians in and about the Illinois country immediately\r\nafter the active occupation by the English troops.[116] A large number\r\nof individual traders were early aware of this and representatives of\r\nsome of the large trading corporations of the East were also preparing\r\nto take advantage of the early opening of the trade. In 1765 Fort Pitt\r\nbecame the great rendezvous for this element, and when the army reached\r\nFort Chartres in October, 1765, it was followed as soon as the season\r\nof the year would permit, by the traders with their cargoes to exchange\r\nfor the Indians' furs. Among the more important figures was George\r\nMorgan,[117] a member of the firm of Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan\r\nof Philadelphia,[118] and the firm's personal representative at the\r\nIllinois, where he first appeared early in 1766,[119] remaining there\r\nthe greater part of the next five years.[120] Other representatives\r\nof this company left Fort Pitt in March of the same year with a large\r\ncargo of goods, which reached Fort Chartres during the summer.[121]\r\nFirms such as Franks and Company of Philadelphia and London and Bently\r\nand Company of Manchac also traded extensively in the Illinois during\r\nthe following years: all the larger British companies becoming rivals\r\nfor that portion of the Indian trade which the English were able to\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nOther and perhaps greater sources of profit to the English merchants\r\nlay in the privilege of furnishing the garrison with provisions[122]\r\nand the Indian department with goods for Indian presents.[123]\r\nAlthough the houses of Baynton, Wharton, and Morgan, and Franks and\r\nCompany were usually competitors for the former privileges, the latter\r\ncompany generally had the monopoly.[124] On the other hand, Baynton,\r\nWharton, and Morgan derived their greatest profits from the sale of\r\nenormous quantities of goods to the government through the Indian\r\ndepartment for distribution among the Indians accustomed to assemble\r\nat the Illinois.[125] But whether all these houses received profits\r\ncommensurate with the risks undertaken is problematical.[126] In the\r\nIndian trade, in which all the merchants were interested, they not\r\nonly had to compete with each other and with independent English\r\ntraders, but with the French and Spanish who had not ceased to ply\r\ntheir trade among their old friends the Indians. This continuance of\r\nforeign traders in British territory was probably the most serious\r\nproblem in the trade situation. Not only did it affect English traders\r\nbut the interests of the empire itself were seriously threatened by the\r\npresence within its limits of unlicensed foreign traders.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that the close of hostilities between France\r\nand England in 1763 and the formal transfer of Canada and the West to\r\nGreat Britain by no means closed the intense rivalry between the fur\r\ntrading elements of the two nations for predominance in the western\r\ntrade: it rather accentuated it. As has already been suggested, France,\r\nuntil cession of the West, had naturally possessed the sphere of\r\ninfluence among the savages of the Mississippi Valley and Canada, and\r\nconsequently the monopoly of the fur trade accrued to her subjects. In\r\nthe upper Ohio river region and among the tribes bordering on or living\r\nwithin the limits of the English colonies, the British, during the\r\nfirst half of the eighteenth century, were either strong rivals of the\r\nFrench or were completely dominant. And it was generally expected that\r\nafter the cession of the West the British would inherit the influence\r\nof the French among the Indians and succeed to the monopoly of the fur\r\ntrade just as Great Britain had succeeded to the sovereignty of the\r\nterritory itself. But the Conspiracy of Pontiac, due in large part to\r\nthe machinations of the French traders, postponed for a considerable\r\nperiod the entry of the British traders, during which time the French\r\nbecame more strongly entrenched than ever in the affections of the\r\nsavages.\r\n\r\nThe character of the French fur traders has already been noted. Their\r\nmethods had from the beginning been different from those pursued by\r\ntheir neighbors and rivals: they lived among the Indians, affected\r\ntheir manners, treated them kindly and respectfully, and supplied all\r\ntheir wants, while the missionary, the connecting link between the\r\ntwo races, was ever present. This association of religion was one of\r\nthe causes of the success of the French in gaining such a permanent\r\nfoothold in the affections of the Indians, but was entirely absent\r\nin the British relation with that race. The English traders were in\r\ngeneral unscrupulous[127] in their dealings with the savages and\r\ndeficient of that tact which enabled Frenchmen to overcome the natural\r\nprejudice of the Indian and acquire an interest with him which would\r\nbe difficult to sever. In that section of the Indian country where\r\nthe influence of Great Britain was such that her traders could go\r\namong the Indians, there was always considerable dissatisfaction on\r\naccount of the methods employed by the large number of independent\r\nand irresponsible traders. Many carried large quantities of rum, some\r\ndealing in nothing else.[128] English traders frequently attended\r\npublic meetings of Indians, gave them liquor during the time for\r\nbusiness and defrauded them of their furs.[129] This abuse was one\r\nof the great causes of complaint against British traders.[130]\r\nIndeed, wherever they participated in the trade, its condition was\r\ndeplorable. Many of the independent traders had little or no credit so\r\nthat the legitimate merchants suffered as well as the Indians.[131]\r\nThey adopted various expedients to draw trade from each other, one\r\nof which was to sell articles below first cost, thus ruining a large\r\nnumber of traders.[132] Fabrications dangerous to the public were\r\nfrequently created to explain the price and condition of goods.[133]\r\nBut probably more injurious still to imperial interests, was the fact\r\nthat whole cargoes of goods were sometimes sold by English firms to\r\nFrench traders thus enabling the latter to engross a great part of the\r\ntrade,[134] depriving the empire of the benefit of the revenue accruing\r\nfrom the importation of furs into England. This practice was probably\r\nfollowed to a greater degree in the farther West, where the French\r\ncontinued to have a monopoly in the trade.\r\n\r\nIt had been expected that the Illinois villages would be the center of\r\ntrade for the English side of the upper Mississippi Valley just as it\r\nhad been one of the centers during the French regime.[135] But, except\r\nfor the few tribes of Illinois Indians in the immediate vicinity,\r\nvery few savages found their way to these posts for trading purposes.\r\nEnglish traders, on the other hand, did not trust themselves far\r\nbeyond this narrow circle.[136] But their French and Spanish rivals\r\nfrom Louisiana, many of whom formally lived in the Illinois, carried\r\non a trade in all directions, both by land and by water.[137] They\r\nascended the Ohio, Wabash, and Illinois rivers[138] and crossed the\r\nMississippi River above the Illinois River, plying their traffic among\r\nthe tribes in the region of the Wisconsin and Fox rivers.[139] This\r\nwas probably the most productive area in the Mississippi Valley in the\r\nsupply of fur bearing animals. The Mississippi River from its junction\r\nwith the Illinois northward was also considered especially good for the\r\npeltry business: the otter, beaver, wolf, cervine, and marten were to\r\nbe found in abundance.[140] But the British traders dared not venture\r\ninto that quarter. The loss of this trade, however, can scarcely be\r\nattributed to their misconduct, for the French had never allowed it\r\nto pass from their own hands. The latter continued to intrigue with\r\nthe Indians throughout the greater part of this period just as they\r\nhad prior to 1765. As we have seen they pointed out to the savages how\r\nthey would suffer from the policy of economy practiced by the British\r\ngovernment.[141] Thus by giving presents and circulating stories and\r\nmisrepresentations the French subjects of Spain attempted to checkmate\r\nevery move of the English.[142] The Indians were constantly reminded\r\nof the bad designs on the part of the English, and were encouraged\r\nwith unauthorized promises of aid in case they took up the hatchet in\r\ndefense of their hunting grounds.[143]\r\n\r\nThis state of affairs continued throughout the greater part of the\r\nperiod, although it was probably modified to some extent after 1770,\r\nfor in that year O'Reilly, the Spanish governor of Louisiana, issued an\r\norder to all the commandants in that colony to prohibit the inhabitants\r\ncrossing the river in the pursuit of trade and whenever any excesses\r\nwere committed satisfaction was to be given the English commandant\r\naccording to the laws of nations.[144]\r\n\r\nDuring the first years of the British occupation there was considerable\r\nfriction in the contact between the two alien peoples in the Illinois\r\nvillages. In spite of the fact that the French who remained became\r\nsubjects of Great Britain there was for several years sharp competition\r\nbetween the English and French residents in the vicinity of the\r\nvillages.[145] The latter were on terms of friendship with the savages\r\nand could go into any part of the country without difficulty and those\r\nIndians who came to Fort Chartres to trade generally preferred to deal\r\nwith their trusted friends. The French often carried the packs of\r\nfurs thus obtained across the river to St. Louis or transported them\r\ndirectly to the New Orleans market. Although the British merchants\r\nwere occasionally to pool their interests with French residents, such\r\ncases were exceptional prior to 1770. In that year, however, General\r\nGage informed the home government that \"the competition between his\r\nMajestys' old and new Subjects is greatly abated & must by degrees\r\nsubside, for if carried to extremes it would be very prejudicial to\r\nboth.\"[146]\r\n\r\nWe have seen in the foregoing study how the British traders were\r\nhandicapped in the prosecution of the trade by their French rivals.\r\nNaturally the large quantities of furs and skins obtained by such\r\ncontraband traders as well as by the French residents of Illinois were\r\ntaken directly to New Orleans and there embarked for the ports of\r\nFrance and Spain. These foreign interlopers, however, only followed\r\nthe course they had long been accustomed to take. On the other hand it\r\nwas expected by the government that the traders who carried English\r\nmanufactured goods down the Ohio River would return by the same route\r\nwith their cargoes of peltry for the purpose of transporting them to\r\nEngland. In this the aim of the ministry miscarried. English traders\r\nand merchants followed the line of least resistance: the route down\r\nthe Mississippi to New Orleans was easier and quicker than up the\r\nOhio and across the country to the sea-coast.[147] Moreover, the New\r\nOrleans market was attractive, for peltries sold at a higher price\r\nthere than in the British market.[148] The tendency of the English\r\ntraders and merchants to follow this course was discovered soon after\r\nthe occupation.[149] In a communication to Secretary Shelburne in 1766\r\nGage informed the government that \"it is reported that the Traders in\r\nWest Florida carry most of their Skins to New Orleans, where they sell\r\nthem at as good a price as is given in London. As I had before some\r\nIntelligence of this, the Officer commanding at Fort Pitt had Orders\r\nto watch the Traders from Pensilvania (sic) who went down the Ohio in\r\nthe Spring to Fort Chartres; & to report the quantity of Peltry they\r\nshould bring up the Ohio in the Autumn. He has just acquainted me\r\nthat the traders do not return to his Post, that they are gone down\r\nthe Mississippi with all their Furrs and Skinns under the pretense of\r\nembarking them at New Orleans for England.\"[150] A few weeks later\r\nhe wrote again in a similar strain: \"That Trade will go with the\r\nstream is a maxim found to be true from all Accounts that have been\r\nreceived of the Indian Trade carried on in that vast Tract of Country\r\nwhich lies in the Back of the British Colonies; and that the peltry\r\nacquired there is carried to the Sea either by the River St. Lawrence\r\nor River Mississippi.\"[151] Gage seemed to believe that the part\r\nwhich went down the St. Lawrence would be transported to England; but\r\nthat the peltry passing through New Orleans would never enter a British\r\nport.[152] \"Nothing but prospect of a superior profit or force will\r\nturn the Channel of Trade contrary to the above maxim.\"[153]\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to figure exactly what the loss to imperial\r\ninterests was under these conditions.[154] Furs and skins, however\r\nbeing among the enumerated commodities[155] some loss certainly accrued\r\nto British shipping and to the government through loss of the duty, as\r\nwell as to English manufacturers. While practically no peltries reached\r\nthe Atlantic ports from the Illinois region, enormous quantities were\r\ncarried to New Orleans. The few who have left any estimate of the\r\namount of peltries exported to New Orleans agree in general that from\r\n500 to 1000 packs were shipped annually from Illinois. According to\r\nthe usual estimate 500 packs were worth in New Orleans about 3500\r\npounds sterling.[156] At New Orleans, where the western trade finally\r\ncentered, it was estimated that peltries worth between 75,000 and\r\n100,000 pounds sterling were sent annually to foreign ports.[157]\r\n\r\nIt became apparent to those in a position to understand the situation\r\nthat those solid advantages which the Government had expected would\r\naccrue in return for the expense of maintaining establishments in the\r\nWest would not be forthcoming, unless some effective though expensive\r\nmeasures be taken. The rivalry of the French who monopolized the larger\r\npart of the trade and who naturally followed their old road to New\r\nOrleans, and the action of the English traders in turning the channel\r\nof their trade down the stream effectually deprived the empire of any\r\nbenefits. Conditions grew no better as the years went by. In 1767 we\r\nfind General Gage complaining that \"as for the Trade of the Ilinois,\r\nand in general of the Mississippi, we may dispose of some manufactures\r\nthere, but whilst Skins and Furrs bear a high price at New Orleans, no\r\nPeltry gained by our manufactures, will ever reach Great Britain, and\r\nif our Traders do not return with the Produce of their Trade to the\r\nNorthern Provinces, by way of the Ohio or Lakes, it will not answer to\r\nEngland to be at much expence about the Mississippi.\"[158] Not only\r\nwere the officials in America, who were in close touch with western\r\naffairs, convinced of the impossibility of obtaining any immediate\r\ncommercial benefits from the country, but one of the leading members\r\nof the ministry, Lord Hillsborough, Secretary for the colonies, took a\r\nsimilar view, in an argument against the planting of western colonies.\r\n\"This Commerce cannot (I apprehend) be useful to Great Britain\r\notherwise than as it furnishes a material for her Manufactures, but\r\nit will on the contrary be prejudicial to her in proportion as other\r\nCountries obtain that material from us without its coming here first; &\r\nwhilst New Orleans is the only Post for Exportation of what goes down\r\nthe Mississippi, no one will believe that that town will not be the\r\nmarket for Peltry or that those restrictions, which are intended to\r\nsecure the exportation of that Commodity directly to G. Britain, can\r\nhave any effect under such circumstances.\"[159] Though there seems to\r\nhave been a unanimity of opinion respecting the commercial inutility of\r\nthe Illinois and surrounding country under existing conditions, there\r\nwere those, however, who believed that with the adoption of certain\r\nmeasures the western country could be made of intrinsic commercial\r\nvalue. Whether any adequate steps could have been taken to turn the\r\nchannel of trade eastward and to exclude foreign traders is uncertain.\r\n\r\nThe original intention of the British government had been to use\r\nFort Chartres to guard the rivers in order to prevent contraband\r\ntrading;[160] but its inefficiency was soon apparent.[161] Although\r\nwell constructed, its location was not strategic; it commanded nothing\r\nbut an island in the river.[162] An indication to the Indians of\r\nBritish dominion[163] and a place of deposit for English merchants\r\nwas about the sum total of its efficiency.[164] In order to make the\r\nIllinois country effective as a bulwark against foreign aggression and\r\nto keep the trade in English hands, thus insuring material advantages\r\nto the empire, it seemed imperative to many who were familiar with\r\nthe situation to adopt measures looking toward the closure of those\r\nnatural entrances into the country, the mouths of the Illinois and\r\nOhio rivers.[165] Almost all the correspondence of the time relating\r\nto Illinois, contains references to the practicability of erecting\r\nforts at the junctions of the Illinois and Ohio rivers with the\r\nMississippi; in most cases this was insisted upon as the only measure\r\nto be adopted to make the country of value.[166] All were further in\r\nagreement that until such plan was carried out no benefits would arise\r\nfrom the possession of that territory. Suggestion were also offered\r\nrelative to the erection of a fort on the Mississippi River above its\r\njunction with the Illinois for the protection of that section of the\r\ncountry.[167] Perhaps the most novel suggestion emanated from General\r\nGage, who declared that in order to gain all the advantages expected it\r\nwould be necessary to amalgamate all the little French villages lying\r\nbetween the Illinois and Ohio rivers into one settlement, which would\r\nalso be the centre of the military establishment; detachments could\r\nthen be sent out to guard the rivers and prevent British merchants\r\nfrom descending the stream to New Orleans and also watch for foreign\r\ninterlopers.[168]\r\n\r\nBut these suggestions one and all failed to receive recognition from\r\nthe government. One of the main reasons for this non-action may well be\r\nsummed up in a statement of Hillsborough's, who appears by 1770 to have\r\nbecome somewhat pessimistic regarding the prospect of any immediate\r\nadvantages from the western trade. He declared in that year that \"Forts\r\n& Military Establishments at the Mouths of the Ohio & Illinois Rivers,\r\nadmitting that they would be effectual to the attainment of the objects\r\nin view, would yet, I fear, be attended with an expence to this Kingdom\r\ngreatly disproportionate to the advantage proposed to be gained.——\"[169]\r\n\r\nThe failure of the government to manage successfully the western trade\r\nprevious to 1770 was not the only reason the ministry hesitated to\r\ndo any thing further. Any measure would have meant the expenditure\r\nof large sums of money with no absolute certainty of an adequate\r\nreturn. The problem of the western trade confronted the ministry at\r\na most unfortunate time. Questions of graver import were arising and\r\ndemanding immediate attention. Instead of seeking new schemes upon\r\nwhich to lavish money, every opportunity was seized upon to curtail\r\nexpenses. The government failed to put into full operation the plan\r\nof 1764 because of the added financial burden it would entail and in\r\n1768 the management of the Indian Trade was transferred from the crown\r\nto the colonies to further reduce the budget. The western question\r\nhad become subordinated to that of the empire. Furs were important\r\nto the manufacturing monopoly of Great Britain, but at this time of\r\nrising discontent and dissatisfaction in the colonies any new projects\r\nentailing further expense were out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nCOLONIZING SCHEMES IN THE ILLINOIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough prior to the Seven Years War France was in nominal possession\r\nof the Ohio and Mississippi valleys, the English colonies on the\r\nsea-board viewed that territory in a different light. The old sea to\r\nsea charters still possessed a potential value in the eyes of British\r\ncolonists and little or no respect was accorded the claims of France.\r\nGradually toward the middle of the century the more enterprising and\r\nfarsighted of the colonists, who appreciated the future value of the\r\nregion, began to lay plans for its systematic exploitation. As early\r\nas 1748, shortly after the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle, the Ohio Company,\r\ncomposed of London merchants and Virginia land speculators obtained\r\nfrom the crown a grant of land south of the Ohio river. This was the\r\nprecursor of several companies formed for similar purposes. In 1754 the\r\nquestion of western expansion had become of sufficient importance to\r\nengage the attention of the Albany Congress, the plans for the creation\r\nof western colonies were discussed by that body.[170] The following\r\nyear Samuel Hazard of Philadelphia outlined a proposition looking\r\ntoward the formation of a western colony,[171]—probably the first which\r\ncomprehended the Illinois country.\r\n\r\nThe treaty of cession of 1763 gave a new impulse to the colonizing\r\nspirit which had lain dormant during the early years of the war. The\r\nEnglish now believed that they were free to occupy at will the\r\nunsettled lands as far westward as the Mississippi River. Early in the\r\nsummer of 1763, before the British ministry had had time to consider\r\nand determine its policy toward the new acquisitions, there was formed\r\nan organization known as the Mississippi Land Company,[172] for the\r\npurpose of planting a colony in the Illinois and Wabash regions. In\r\nthis scheme some of the most prominent inhabitants of Virginia and\r\nMaryland were interested,[173]—indeed membership in the organization\r\nwas drawn almost entirely from those two colonies and from London. The\r\nCompany was eventually to be composed of fifty members who were to\r\ncontribute equally towards the maintenance of an agent in England, to\r\nwhom was intrusted the duty of soliciting from the crown a grant of two\r\nmillion five hundred thousand acres of land[174] on the Mississippi and\r\nits tributaries, the Wabash and Ohio rivers. The proposed grant was\r\nto be \"laid off within the following bounds beginning upon the East\r\nside of the Rivers Mississippi one hundred and twenty miles above or\r\nto the northward of the confluence of the River Ohio therewith. Thence\r\nby a line to strike the river Wabash or St. Ireon eighty miles above\r\nthe union of Ohio and Wabash, and abutting on the main branch of the\r\nRiver Cherokee or Tennessee one hundred fifty mile above the junction\r\nof Cherokee River with Ohio and proceeding thence Westerly in a line\r\nto strike the River Mississippi seventy miles below the union of Ohio\r\nwith that River; thence upon the said River to the beginning.\"[175]\r\nThe subscribers were to be free to retain their lands twelve years\r\nor more at the pleasure of the crown without the payment of taxes on\r\nquit rents. Within the same period also the company was to be obliged\r\nto settle two hundred families in the colony, unless prevented by\r\nIndians or a foreign enemy.[176] In order to insure against any such\r\ninterruption, it was hinted that the government might establish and\r\ngarrison two forts,—one at the confluence of the Cherokee[177] and Ohio\r\nrivers, and the other at the mouth of the Ohio.[178]\r\n\r\nIn their petition the memorialists enumerate the advantages they expect\r\nthe empire to receive in case the land be granted, special emphasis\r\nbeing laid on two points of view,—commerce and defence. \"The Increase\r\nof the people, the extension of trade and the enlargement of the\r\nrevenue are with certainty to be expected, where the fertility of the\r\nsoil, and mildness of the climate invite emigrants (provided they can\r\nobtain Lands on easy terms) to settle and cultivate commodities most\r\nwanted by Great Britain and which will bear the charges of a tedious\r\nnavigation, by the high prices usually given for them,—such as Hemp,\r\nFlax, Silk, Wine, Potash, Cochineal, Indigo, Iron, &c., by which means\r\nthe Mother Country will be supplied with many necessary materials,\r\nthat are now purchased by foreigners at a very great expense.\"[179]\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of both trade and defense, the company proposed\r\n\"that by conducting a trade useful to the Indians on the borders of the\r\nMississippi they will effectually prevent the success of that cruel\r\npolicy, which has ever directed the French in time of peace, to prevail\r\nwith the Indians their neighbors to lay waste the frontiers of your\r\nMajestie's Colonies thereby to prevent their increase.\"[180]\r\n\r\nLastly, the establishment of a buffer colony would effectually prevent\r\nthe probable encroachments of the French from the West side of the\r\nMississippi, and cut off their political and commercial connection with\r\nthe Indians. They would \"thereby be prevented from instigating them to\r\nWar, and the harrassing the frontier Counties as they have constantly\r\ndone of all the Colonies.\"[181]\r\n\r\nThe plan received its first official check in the year of its\r\ninception, when in October, 1763, the British ministry announced its\r\nwestern policy in a proclamation according to which all the territory\r\nlying north of the Floridas and west of the Alleghanies was reserved\r\nfor the use of the Indians.[182] Thereafter the colonial governors were\r\nforbidden to issue patents for land within this reservation without the\r\nconsent of the crown.[183] However, the enounciation of this policy\r\ndid not deter this and similar companies from pressing their claims\r\nupon the Board of Trade. The more far-sighted of the Americans\r\nhad probably correctly interpreted the proclamation as temporary in\r\ncharacter and as promulgated to allay the alarm of the savages.[184]\r\nThe Mississippi company therefore continued to solicit the grant until\r\n1769, when it was decided that on account of the temper of the ministry\r\ntowards America, it would be advisable to allow the matter to rest\r\nfor a time in the hope that a change in the government would bring a\r\ncorresponding change in policy.[185] But at no time does it appear that\r\nthe promoters of the colony received the slightest encouragement from\r\nthose in authority.[186]\r\n\r\nAbout the time of the Mississippi company in 1763, General Charles\r\nLee[187] outlined a scheme for the establishment of two colonies, one\r\non the Ohio River below its junction with the Wabash, and the other\r\non the Illinois River.[188] It was his plan to organize a company\r\nand petition the crown for the necessary grants of land.[189] A\r\nportion of the settlers were to be procured in new England, and the\r\nremainder from among Protestants of Germany and Switzerland.[190] In\r\nnarrating the probable advantages which he thinks would be derived\r\nfrom such settlements, Lee takes practically the same point of view\r\nas the Mississippi company, adding the suggestion that a new channel\r\nof commerce would be opened up through the Mississippi River and\r\nthe Gulf of Mexico.[191] This proposal suffered the same fate as\r\nits contemporary in being objected by the ministry, whose policy of\r\nallowing no settlements in the country beyond the mountains had been\r\ntoo recently adopted.[192]\r\n\r\nThus far there seems to be no indication that the above mentioned\r\ncolonizing schemes received encouragement from any one in close touch\r\nwith the government. Apparently the authors of those projects did not\r\nhave the ear of those members of the ministry, whose general attitude\r\ngave some ground for the belief that in the end plans for western\r\nsettlements would be adopted. The most prominent among these was Lord\r\nShelbourne, whose personal attitude favored carving the West into\r\ncolonies. Possibly his friendship with Dr. Franklin influenced him in\r\npart to throw the weight of his prestige in favor of a new plan for a\r\ncolony, promoted this time by prominent merchants and land speculators\r\nof New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey. It was in 1766 that the\r\nnext definite scheme appeared, although it is probable that there\r\nwere many others, for during those years half of England was said to\r\nhave been \"New Land mad as every body there had their eyes fixt on\r\nthis Country.\"[193] Pamphlet literature was printed and disseminated\r\nthroughout England and America from 1763 on advocating the feasibility\r\nof settling the new lands,[194] which doubtless had considerable\r\ninfluence. It is hardly probable that the few definite propositions\r\nof which we have recorded were the only schemes projected during this\r\nperiod.[195]\r\n\r\nThe plan of 1764 had its origin we may safely say as 1764. In January\r\nof that year the Board of Trade received a communication from one of\r\nthe promoters of the plan, George Croghan, who was then in England,\r\nasking their Lordships \"whether it would not be good policy at this\r\ntime while we certainly have it in our power to secure all the\r\nadvantages we have got there by making a purchase of the Indians\r\ninhabiting the Country along the Mississippi from the mouth of the Ohio\r\nup to the sources of the River Illinois, and there plant a respectable\r\ncolony, in order to secure our frontiers, and prevent the French from\r\nany attempt to rival us in the Fur trade with the Natives, by drawing\r\nthe Ohio and Lake Indians over the Mississippi which they have already\r\nattempted by the last accounts we have from Detroit.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThe tentative proposition thus suggested by Croghan to the Board\r\nwas in essence the same plan that he and his associates developed\r\ntwo years later. In its general outline there is no intimation that\r\nCroghan intended at this time to include the cultivated lands of the\r\nFrench inhabitants of Illinois who might leave that country.[197] But\r\nSir William Johnson, his superior in the Indian department in America\r\nand his constant associate in colonizing enterprizes, writing to the\r\ntwo years subsequently, gave as his opinion that \"some of the present\r\nInhabitants may possibly incline to go home, and our Traders will I\r\ndare say chuse to purchase their rights, this may be the foundation\r\nfor a Valuable Colony in that Country, —-—, this may be effected in\r\ntime, & large cessions obtained of the Natives.\"[198] This idea of\r\nbasing the colony in part upon the lands vacated by the French was a\r\nfew weeks later taken up and emphasized by General Gage. He declared\r\nthat there was only one way to obviate the difficulties in Illinois\r\non account of lack of provisions for the army as well as to form at\r\nthe least expense a barrier against probable incursions of foreigners\r\nfrom Louisiana. That method must be to \"grant the lands deserted by the\r\nFrench, which I presume forfeited, as well as other Lands unsettled,\r\nusing necessary Precautions to avoid Disputes with the Indians, to\r\nthe British Settlers.\"[199] While Croghan, Johnson, and Gage were\r\nthus advocating the purchase of the French claims and some additional\r\nIndian lands with the view of forming a buffer colony, Governor William\r\nFranklin of New Jersey and some Philadelphia merchants, all friends of\r\nthe Indian agent Croghan, were promoting the same scheme, and on March\r\n29th, 1766, Governor Franklin drew up[200] a formal sketch.[201] \"A\r\nfew of us, from his (Croghan's) encouragement, have formed a Company,\r\nto purchase of the French, settled at the Illinois, such lands as\r\nthey have a good title to, and are inclined to dispose of. But as I\r\nthought it would be of little avail to buy lands in the Country,\r\nunless a Company were established there, I have drawn some proposals\r\nfor that purpose, which are much approved of by Col. Croghan and the\r\nother gentlemen concerned in Philadelphia, and are sent by them to Sir\r\nWilliam Johnson for his sentiments, and when we receive them, the whole\r\nwill be forwarded to you. It is proposed that the Company shall consist\r\nof twelve, now in America, and if you like the proposals, you will\r\nbe at liberty to add Yourself, & such other gentlemen of character &\r\nfortune in England, as you may think will be most likely to promote the\r\nundertaking.\"[202]\r\n\r\nFranklin's letter to his father explains very clearly the steps in the\r\ndevelopment of the plan up to that time. It is necessary, however, to\r\nexamine other sources in order to ascertain details concerning the\r\nproposition. The Articles of Agreement as outlined by Governor Franklin\r\ncontains the tentative proposal that application be made to the crown\r\nfor a grant in the Illinois country of 1,200,000 acres or \"more if to\r\nbe procured.\"[203] Provision was also made in the original draft for\r\nten equal shareholders, the stipulation to be subject to change in case\r\nothers desired to enter the company.[204] The original draft was sent\r\nto Sir William Johnson who was requested to consider the proposals and\r\nmake any alterations he saw fit.[205] The articles were then to be\r\nreturned to Governor Franklin, with Johnson's recommendations to the\r\nministry.[206] Through Franklin the papers were to be forwarded to Dr.\r\nFranklin in London, to whom was intrusted the task of negotiating with\r\nthe ministry.[207]\r\n\r\nIn his recommendations Johnson urged upon the ministry the adoption\r\nof the proposals and in addition offered a number of suggestions\r\namong which the following are of interest.[208] 1. The crown should\r\npurchase from the Indians all their right to the territory in the\r\nIllinois country. 2. A civil government should be established. 3. The\r\nproposed land grants should be laid out in townships according to the\r\npractice in New England. 4. Provincial officers and soldiers who served\r\nin the French war should receive grants. 5. The mines and minerals\r\nshould belong to the owners of the land in which they may be found,\r\nexcept royal mines, from which the crown might receive a fifth. 6. In\r\nevery township 500 acres should be reserved for the maintenance of a\r\nclergyman of the Established Church of England. 7. Finally the lands of\r\nthe colony were suggested as follows:—From the mouth of the Ouisconsin\r\n(or Wisconsin) River down the Mississippi agreeable to Treaty, to the\r\nForks, or Mouth of the Ohio. Then up the same River Ohio to the River\r\nWabash, thence up the same River Wabash to the Portage at the Head\r\nthereof. Then by the said Portage to the River Miamis and down the said\r\nRiver Miamis to Lake Erie. Thence along the several Courses of the said\r\nLake to Riviere al Ours (or Bear River) and up the said River to the\r\nHead thereof, and from thence in a straight Line, or by the Portage of\r\nSt. Josephs River & down the same River to Lake Michigan then along the\r\nseveral Courses of the said Lake on the South and West Side thereof\r\nto the point of Bay Puans, and along the several Courses on the East\r\nSide of the said Bay to the Mouth of Foxes River, thence up to the Head\r\nthereof and from thence by a Portage to the Head of Ouisconsin River,\r\nand down the same to the Place of Beginning.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin exerted every effort to advance the project in\r\nEngland, but with little success. Lord Shelburne, who was at this\r\ntime Secretary of State for the southern department, was also ready\r\nand anxious to see the new colony established, and he was able to\r\ninfluence the ministry to take a favorable view. Others in authority,\r\nhowever, and particularly members of the Board of Trade, were opposed\r\nto the proposition.[209] In 1768, the Board, under the presidency\r\nof Hillsborough, reported adversely and the question of the Illinois\r\ncolony was dropped. Attention of land speculators was now called to the\r\nnew Vandalia colony in the upper Ohio region.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nEVENTS IN THE ILLINOIS COUNTRY, 1765-1768.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing chapters an attempt has been made to point out\r\ncertain general aspects relating to the West and to the Illinois\r\ncountry, with special reference to the governmental status of the old\r\nFrench settlements after the conquest, the extension of the English\r\nlaw to the conquered territory, some of the problems of the Indian\r\nand trade relations, and finally attention has been called to some\r\nof the projects for the colonization of the Illinois country after\r\n1763. What were the actual events taking place in the Illinois after\r\nthe occupation has always been problematical. Previous writers have\r\nalmost without exception dismissed with a sentence the first two\r\nor three years of the period. Indeed the whole thirteen years of\r\nBritish administration have generally been crowded into two or three\r\nparagraphs. Although the available historical material relating to\r\nthe material to the period in general has recently been considerably\r\naugmented, there yet remain gaps which must be bridged before a\r\ncomplete history of the colony under the British can be written.\r\n\r\nAmong the first duties of the British commandant after taking formal\r\npossession of Fort de Chartres in October, 1765, was to announce to\r\nthe inhabitants the contents of Gage's proclamation. It is only from\r\nthis document that we know anything of the status of the individual\r\ninhabitants of Illinois. One of its leading features was a clause\r\ngranting to the French the right of the free exercise of the Roman\r\nCatholic religion \"in the same manner as in Canada,\"[210] which was\r\nthe fulfillment on the part of the British government of the pledge\r\nstipulated in the IVth article of the treaty of Paris, containing the\r\nfollowing clause: \"Brittanick Majesty agrees to grant the liberty\r\nof the Catholic religion to the inhabitants of Canada; he will\r\nconsequently give the most precise and effectual orders, that his new\r\nRoman Catholic subjects may profess the worship of their religion,\r\naccording to the rites of the Roman Catholic Church, as far as the\r\nlaws of Great Britain permit.\"[211] This provision appertained to the\r\nwhole western territory as well as to Canada proper. Prior to the\r\ntreaty of cession the Illinois and Wabash settlements were subject to\r\nthe jurisdiction of Louisiana, while approximately the country north\r\nof the Fortieth parallel had been within the limits of Canada. But\r\nin the treaty all the territory lying between the Alleghanies and\r\nthe Mississippi river was described as a dependency of Canada. The\r\ngovernment was thus commited to religious toleration within the whole\r\nextent of the ceded territory. This meant, however, that only the\r\nreligious privileges of the church had been secured, for the clause in\r\nthe treaty, \"as far as the laws of Great Britain permit,\" meant that\r\npapal authority would not be tolerated within the British empire.\r\n\r\nOther clauses provided that all the inhabitants of Illinois who\r\nhad been subjects of the king of France, might if they so desired,\r\nsell their estates and retire with their effects to Louisiana. No\r\nrestraint would be placed on their emigration, except for debt or\r\non account of criminal processes.[212] This was also a fulfillment of\r\nthe pledges made in the treaty of Paris.[213] All the inhabitants who\r\ndesired to retain their estates and become subjects of Great Britain\r\nwere guaranteed security for their persons and effects and liberty of\r\ntrade.[214] Finally they were commanded to take the oath of allegiance\r\nand fidelity to the crown in case they remained on British soil.[215]\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Sterling proceeded to Kaskaskia to post the proclamation\r\nand to administer the oaths of allegiance for which he was empowered\r\nby the commanding general, he was confronted by an unexpected movement\r\non the part of the inhabitants. A petition was presented signed by the\r\nrepresentative French of the village, asking for a respite of nine\r\nmonths in order that they might settle their affairs and decide whether\r\nthey wished to remain under the British government or withdraw from\r\nthe country.[216] At first Sterling refused to grant the request.[217]\r\nAccording to the terms of the Paris treaty the inhabitants of the ceded\r\nterritory had been given eighteen months in which to withdraw, the time\r\nto be computed from the date of the exchange of ratifications.[218] The\r\nlimit had long since expired, and it was therefore beyond the power of\r\nSterling or his superior General Gage to grant legally an extension of\r\ntime.[219] When, however, the commandant perceived that unless some\r\nconcessions were granted, the village would be immediately depopulated,\r\nhe extended the time to the first of March, 1766, with the provisions\r\nthat a temporary oath of allegence be given,[220] and that all desiring\r\nto leave the country should give in their names in advance.[221] To\r\nthis tentative proposition the French in Kaskaskia agreed on condition\r\nthat Sterling forward to the commanding general a petition, in which\r\nthey ask for the longer time.[222] An officer was dispatched to the\r\nvillages of Prairie du Rocher, St. Phillipe, and Cahokia where similar\r\narrangements were made.[223]\r\n\r\nThe machinery of civil government in operation under the French regime\r\nhad become badly deranged during the French and Indian war and when the\r\nrepresentatives of the English government entered the country affairs\r\nwere in a chaotic state. The commandant of the English troops had of\r\ncourse no authority to govern the inhabitants. But he found himself\r\nface to face with conditions which made immediate action imperative.\r\nPractically the only civil officers Sterling found on the English side\r\nof the river were Joseph La Febevre, who acted as Judge, Attorney\r\nGeneral and Guardian of the Royal Warehouse, and Joseph Labuxiere,\r\nwas Clerk and Notary Public.[224] But those men retired with St. Ange\r\nand the French soldiers to St. Louis shortly after the arrival of\r\nthe English.[225] This brought the whole governmental machinery to a\r\nstandstill, and the English commander was forced to act. He determined\r\nto appoint a judge and after consulting the principal inhabitants of\r\nthe villages, selected M. La Grange, who was intrusted \"to decide\r\nall disputes according to the Laws and Customs of the Country,\"\r\nwith liberty to appeal to the commandant in case the litigants were\r\ndissatisfied with his decision.[226] The captains of militia seem to\r\nhave retained their positions under the British, their duties being\r\npractically the same as in the French regime. Each village or parish\r\nhad its captain who saw to the enforcement of decrees and other civil\r\nmatters as well as looking after the local militia.[227] The office\r\nof royal commissary continued and James Rumsey, a former officer\r\nin the English army was appointed to this position.[228] But who\r\nwas to continue the duties of the old French commandants with both\r\nhis civil and military functions? Obviously the most logical person\r\nwas the commanding officer of the English troops stationed at the\r\nfort, with the difference that the former held a special commission\r\nfor the performance of these duties, while the latter had no such\r\nauthorisation. A further and more fundamental difference lay in\r\nthe fact that formerly the French had the right to appeal to the\r\nSuperior Council at New Orleans, while apparently no such corresponding\r\nsafeguard was given them by the new arrangement.\r\n\r\nSterling did not long retain command of the post[229] for in December\r\nhe was superseded by Major Robert Farmer,[230] his superior in rank,\r\nwho arrived from Mobile with a detachment of the 34th regiment, after\r\nan eight months voyage. Their arrival was exceedingly welcome to\r\nSterling and his men since they were becoming greatly embarrassed for\r\nlack of provisions, ammunition, and presents for the Indians.[231]\r\nWhen they left Fort Pitt in August, it had not been thought necessary\r\nto transport more than sixty pounds of ammunition inasmuch as Fort\r\nde Chartres was expected to yield a sufficient supply, and both Gage\r\nand Sterling believed that Croghan, with his cargo of supplies, would\r\nbe awaiting the arrival of the troops at the Illinois.[232] Neither\r\nexpectation was realized. Croghan was back in the colonies prior to\r\nSterling's arrival at the post, and when the fort was transferred, it\r\nyielded neither ammunition nor other supplies in sufficient quantity to\r\nmeet the needs of the troops.[233]\r\n\r\nAn assembly of three or four thousand Indians had been accustomed to\r\ngather at the fort each spring to receive annual gifts from the French.\r\nBut the English had made no provisions for such a contingency, which,\r\ncoupled with the weakness of the garrison and the recent hostility of\r\nthe Indians, would probably lead to serious complications. A possible\r\ndefection of the Indians, therefore, necessitated a large supply of\r\nmilitary stores[234] which it was possible to obtain from the French\r\nmerchants in the villages. The latter agreed to furnish the soldiers\r\nwith ammunition, on the condition that other provisions would also\r\nbe purchased,[235] for which the English alleged they charged an\r\nexorbitant price.[236] Sterling was compelled to acquiesce, for the\r\nmerchants had sent their goods across the river where he could not get\r\nat them.[237]\r\n\r\nThe large supply of provisions which the colony had produced in former\r\nyears seems to have decreased, at any rate it fell far short of the\r\nexpectations of the English officers. One officer writes at this time\r\nthat \"they have indeed but little here, and are doing us a vast favor\r\nwhen they let us have a Gallon of French brandy at twenty Shillings\r\nSterling, and as the price is not as yet regulated the Eatables is in\r\nthe same proportion.\"[238] The wealth of colony had been considerably\r\nimpaired since the occupation on account of the exodus of a large\r\nnumber of French who disobeyed the order of Sterling that all who\r\ndesired to withdraw should give in their names in advance. Taking\r\ntheir cattle, grain and effects across the ferries at Cahokia and\r\nKaskaskia, they found homes at St. Louis and St. Genevieve on the\r\nSpanish side.[239] Probably a large part of the emigrants left in\r\nthe hope that in Louisiana they might still enjoy their ancient laws\r\nand privileges,[240] and others from fear lest the Indians, who were\r\nnow assuming a threatening attitude, might destroy their crops and\r\nhomes.[241]\r\n\r\nThe acute situation of the garrison brought on by the dearth of\r\nsupplies continued through the winter and spring of 1765 and 1766.[242]\r\nFarmer estimated that all the provisions available amounted to no more\r\nthan fifty thousand pounds of flour and 1250 pounds of corn meal,[243]\r\nupon which the garrison could barely subsist till the following July;\r\nand a portion of this stock would have to be given to the Indians,\r\nsince representatives of the Indian department had not yet appeared.\r\nThese circumstances obliged Major Farmer to send Sterling and his\r\ntroops to New York by way of the Mississippi river and New Orleans\r\ninstead of up the Ohio river in accordance with Gage's orders.[244] In\r\nresponse to a series of urgent requests for assistance, Gage employed\r\na force of Indians to transport a cargo to the Illinois,[245] which\r\nreached Fort Chartres during the early summer of 1766, by which time\r\nalso representatives of the English merchants at Philadelphia had\r\narrived with large stores of supplies.[246] Henceforth we hear nothing\r\nfurther of a shortage of provisions in the Illinois, for not only did\r\nthe English merchants import large supplies from the East, but cargoes\r\nwere brought up the Mississippi from New Orleans by the French;[247]\r\nand for a time the English government itself transported the necessary\r\nprovisions from Fort Pitt.[248]\r\n\r\nLate in the summer of 1766 Farmer was relieved by Lieutenant Colonel\r\nReid, who arrived during the summer from Mobile with another detachment\r\nof the thirty-fourth regiment.[249] Reid soon became obnoxious to\r\nthe people on account of his tyrannical acts, many of which have been\r\nrecorded in Colonel George Morgan's letter book. His administration\r\nof affairs, however, continued over a period of two years. In 1768 he\r\nwas relieved by Colonel John Wilkins who ruled the French for the next\r\nthree years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlden, George Henry, New Governments West of the Alleghany Mountains\r\nbefore 1780.
