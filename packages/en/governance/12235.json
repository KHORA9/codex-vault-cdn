The\r\ntreatment was as untechnical as possible. The lectures themselves were\r\nfor men who meant to go into business, for journalists, or political\r\nstudents; a general view--an elemental, broad general view--of the\r\nproblems that confront legislation to-day. So is the book not one for\r\nlawyers alone; it seeks to cover both what has been accomplished\r\nby law-making in the past, and what is now being adopted or even\r\nproposed; the history of statutes of legislation by the people as\r\ndistinct from \"judge-made\" law; how far legislatures can cure the\r\nevils that confront the state or the individual, and what the future\r\nof American legislation is likely to be. Constitutional difficulties\r\nI had merely mentioned, as there was another course of lectures on\r\nAmerican constitutional principles, which supplemented it.[1] In those\r\nI tried to show what we _cannot_ do by legislation; in these I merely\r\ndiscussed what had been done, and tried to show what we are now doing.\r\nWhat we may _not_ do may sound, perhaps, like a narrow field; but the\r\ngrowth of constitutional law in this country is so wide--in the first\r\nplace including all the English Constitution, and more than that,\r\nso many principles of human liberty that have been adopted into our\r\nConstitution, either at the time it was adopted, or which have crept\r\ninto it through the Fourteenth Amendment, with all the innovations\r\nof State constitutions as well--that really the discussion of what\r\n_cannot_ be done by statute takes one almost over the entire range of\r\nconstitutional law and even into the discussion of what cannot be done\r\nin a free country or under ordinary principles of human liberty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The Law of the Federal and State Constitutions of\r\nthe United States,\" Boston Book Company, 1908. \"The American\r\nConstitution,\" Scribners, New York, 1907.]\r\n\r\nHow many of us have ever formulated in our minds what _law_ means? I\r\nam inclined to think that the most would give a meaning that was never\r\nthe meaning of the word _law_, at least until a very few years\r\nago; that is, the meaning which alone is the subject of this book,\r\n_statute_ law. The notion of law as a _statute_, a thing passed by a\r\nlegislature, a thing enacted, made new by representative assembly, is\r\nperfectly modern, and yet it has so thoroughly taken possession of our\r\nminds, and particularly of the American mind (owing to the forty-eight\r\nlegislatures that we have at work, besides the National Congress,\r\nevery year, and to the fact that they try to do a great deal to\r\ndeserve their pay in the way of enacting laws), that statutes have\r\nassumed in our minds the main bulk of the concept of law as we\r\nformulate it to ourselves. I guess that the ordinary newspaper reader,\r\nwhen he talks about \"laws\" or reads about \"law,\" thinks of statutes;\r\nbut that is a perfectly modern concept; and the thing itself, even\r\nas we now understand it, is perfectly modern. There were no statutes\r\nwithin the present meaning of the word more than a very few centuries\r\nago. But statutes are precisely the subject of this book; legislation,\r\nthe tendency of statute-making, the spirit of statutes that we have\r\nmade, that we are making, and that we are likely to make, or that are\r\nnow being proposed; so it is concerned, in a sense, with the last and\r\nmost recent and most ready-made of all legal or political matters. The\r\nsubject of statute-making is not thought difficult; it is supposed\r\nto be perfectly capable of discussion by any one of our State\r\nlegislators, with or without legal training; and sometimes with\r\nlamentable consequences. For the subject is of the most immense\r\nimportance, now that the bulk of all our law is, or is supposed to be,\r\nstatutes.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand, therefore, what a statute is, and why it has\r\ngrown important to consider statute-making, it is necessary to have\r\nsome knowledge of the meaning of the word _law_, and of the origin\r\nboth of representative government and of legislatures, before we come\r\nto statutes, as we understand them; for parliaments existed centuries\r\nbefore they made statutes as we now use this word. _Statutes_ with\r\nus are recent; _legislatures_ making statutes are recent everywhere;\r\nlegislatures themselves are fairly recent; that is, they date only\r\nfrom the end of the Dark Ages, at least in Anglo-Saxon countries.\r\nRepresentative government itself is supposed, by most scholars, to be\r\nthe one invention that is peculiar to the Anglo-Saxon people.\r\n\r\nAnd there is another invention--if we can call it one--to my mind of\r\nfar greater importance, which I should urge was also peculiar to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon people; that is, the invention or the idea of personal\r\nliberty; which is understood, and always has been understood, by\r\nAnglo-Saxons in a sense in which it never existed before, so far as I\r\nknow, in any people in the history of the world. It is that notion of\r\npersonal liberty which was the cause of representative government, not\r\nrepresentative government that was the cause of personal liberty. In\r\nother words, the people did not get up a parliament for the sake of\r\nhaving that parliament enact laws securing personal liberty. It was\r\nthe result of a condition of personal liberty which prevailed among\r\nthem and in their laws that resulted in representative government, and\r\nin the institution of a legislature, making, as we now would say, the\r\nlaws; though a thousand years ago they never said that a legislature\r\n_made_ laws, they only said that it _told what the laws were_. This is\r\nanother very important distinction. The \"law\" of the free Anglo-Saxon\r\npeople was regarded as a thing existing by itself, like the sunlight,\r\nor at least as existing like a universally accepted custom observed by\r\nevery one. It was five hundred years before the notion crept into the\r\nminds, even of the members of the British Parliaments, that they could\r\nmake a _new_ law. What they supposed they did, and what they were\r\nunderstood by the people to do, was merely to _declare_ the law, as it\r\nwas then and as it had been from time immemorial; the notion always\r\nbeing--and the farther back you go and the more simple the people are,\r\nthe more they have that notion--that their free laws and customs were\r\nsomething which came from the beginning of the world, which they\r\nalways held, which were immutable, no more to be changed than the\r\nforces of nature; and that no parliament, under the free Anglo-Saxon\r\ngovernment, or later under the Norman kings, who tried to make them\r\nunfree, no king, could ever _make_ a law, but could only declare what\r\nthe law was. The Latin phrase for that distinction is _jus dare_, and\r\n_jus dicere_. In early England, in Anglo-Saxon times, the Parliament\r\nnever did anything but tell what the law was; and, as I said, not\r\nonly what it was then, but what it had been, as they supposed, for\r\nthousands of years before. The notion of a legislature to make _new_\r\nlaws is an entirely modern conception of Parliament. How did it arise?\r\nThe English Parliament,[1] as you doubtless know, was the successor,\r\nor grew out of the old Witenagemot, the old Saxon Great Council, and\r\nthat Great Council originally--and I am now talking of centuries\r\nbefore the Conquest--the Witenagemot, included in theory all the free\r\ninhabitants of the realm, just as a modern town meeting does. Mind\r\nyou, they were then tribes, living in \"Hundreds.\" They were not\r\nnations, not even states and counties, and in early times it probably\r\nwas possible to have a popular assembly which should include at least\r\nall the warriors, all the fighting men, and consequently all the men\r\nwhose votes counted. No man who could not fight could share in the\r\ngovernment--an historical fact which our suffragists tend to ignore\r\nwhen they talk of \"rights.\" The Witenagemot, undoubtedly, was\r\noriginally a universal assembly of the tribe in question. But as\r\nthe tribes got amalgamated, were associated together, or at least\r\nlocalized instead of wandering about, and particularly when they got\r\nlocalized in England--where before they had been but a roaming people\r\non account of their struggles with the Britons--the necessity of\r\ngreater organization probably became obvious to them at once, and the\r\nWitenagemot readily assumed a somewhat more formal form; and that\r\nresulted in representation. For we are talking of early England;\r\nthat is, of the eastern half of what is now England, the Saxon part;\r\nobviously you couldn't put all the members even of East Anglia in one\r\nhall or in one field to discuss laws, so they invented representation.\r\nAll the authorities appear to be agreed that there is no prototype\r\nfor what seems to us such a very simple thing as representation,\r\nrepresentative government, among the Greeks or the Romans, or any\r\nof the older civilizations of which we have knowledge. It is very\r\nsurprising that it is so, and I am always expecting that some one will\r\ndiscover, either in the Achaian League or somewhere, that it is not\r\nso, that there is a prototype; but there doesn't seem to be any\r\nregular system of representative government until you get to\r\nAnglo-Saxon peoples. So that was the second stage of the Witenagemot,\r\nand then it properly begins to be called the Great Assembly or\r\nCouncil of the people. This representative assembly was then not only\r\nlegislative, it was also executive, to some extent, and entirely\r\njudicial; for we are a thousand years before the notion of the\r\nthreefold division of government has occurred to any one. The early\r\nSaxon Witenagemot, as later the Norman kings tried to, did unite all\r\nthree functions in themselves. Their main function was judicial; for\r\nthe reason that there was very little notion as yet of _legislation_,\r\nin a people or tribe whose simple customs and simple property demanded\r\nvery few laws, where the first remedy for any man for any attack on\r\nhis family or property was the remedy of his own good, right hand.\r\nWhen you really only got into a lawsuit, at least as concerning\r\nproperty, as a result of a killing of somebody or other, albeit in\r\ndefence of one's own chattels, it is obvious that there need not be\r\nmuch legislation; the laws were too well known, the unwritten law too\r\nwell enforced. It probably would have surprised the early Englishman\r\nif he had been told that either he or anybody else didn't _know_ the\r\nlaw--still more that there was ever any need for any parliament or\r\nassembly to tell him what it was. They all knew the law, and they all\r\nknew that they knew the law, and the law was a thing that they knew as\r\nnaturally as they knew fishing and hunting. They had grown up into it.\r\nIt never occurred to them as an outside thing.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Gneist, \"The English Parliament,\" and Skottowe, \"History\r\nof Parliament,\" perhaps best summarize this view.]\r\n\r\nSo it has been found that where you take children, modern children,\r\nat least boys who are sons of educated parents, and put them in large\r\nmasses by themselves, they will, without apparently any reading,\r\nrapidly invent a notion of law; that is, they will invent a certain\r\nset of customs which are the same thing to them as law, and which\r\nindeed are the same as law. They have tried in Johns Hopkins\r\nUniversity experiments among children, to leave them entirely alone,\r\nwithout any instruction, and it is quite singular how soon customs\r\nwill grow up, and it is also quite singular and a thing that always\r\nsurprises the socialist and communist, that about the earliest concept\r\nat which they _will_ arrive is that of private property! They will\r\nsoon get a notion that one child owns a stick, or toy, or seat,\r\nand the others must respect that property. This I merely use as an\r\nillustration to show how simple the notion of law was among our\r\nancestors in England fifteen hundred years ago, and how it had grown\r\nup with them, of course, from many centuries, but in much the same way\r\nthat the notion of custom or law grows up among children. The English\r\nhad acquired naturally, but with the tradition of centuries, the\r\nnotion of law a _sexisting_; and that brings us to the next point.\r\n\r\nHere again we are so confused with our modern notions of law that it\r\nis very important not to be misled by them at the beginning. I am\r\nquite sure that all the American people when they think of law in\r\nthe sense I am now speaking of, even when they are not thinking\r\nnecessarily of statute law, do mean, nevertheless, a law which is\r\nenforced by somebody with power, somebody with a big stick. They\r\nmean a law, an ordinance, an order or dictate addressed to them by\r\na sovereign, or by at least a power of some sort; and they mean an\r\nordinance which if they break they are going to suffer for, either in\r\nperson or in property. In other words, they have a notion of law as a\r\nwritten command addressed by the sovereign to the subject, or at least\r\nby one of the departments of government to the citizen. Now, that, I\r\nmust caution you, is in the first place rather a modern notion of law,\r\nquite modern in England; it is really Roman, and wasn't law as it was\r\nunderstood by our Anglo-Saxon ancestors. He didn't think of law as\r\na thing written, addressed to him by the king. Neither did he\r\nnecessarily think of it as a thing which had any definite punishment\r\nattached or any code attached, any _sanction_, as we call it, or thing\r\nwhich enforces the law; a penalty, or fine, or imprisonment. There are\r\njust as good \"sanctions\" for law outside of the sanctions that our\r\npeople usually think of as there are inside of them; and often very\r\nmuch better. For instance, the sanction of a strong custom. Take any\r\nexample you like; there are many States where marriage between blacks\r\nand whites is not made unlawful, but where practically it is made\r\ntremendously unlawful by the force of public opinion. Take the case of\r\ndebts of honor, so-called, debts of gambling; they are paid far more\r\nuniversally than ordinary commercial debts, even by the same people;\r\nbut there is no _law_ enforcing them--there is no _sanction_ for the\r\ncollection of gambling debts. And take any custom that grows up. We\r\nknow how strong our customs in college are. Take the mere custom of a\r\nclub table; no one dares or ventures to supplant the members at that\r\ntable. That kind of sanction is just as good a law as a law made\r\nby statute and imposing five or ten dollars penalty or a week's\r\nimprisonment. And judges or juries recognize those things as laws,\r\njust as much as they do statute laws; when all other laws are lacking,\r\nour courts will ask what is the \"custom of the trade.\" These be laws;\r\nand are often better enforced than the statute law; the rules of the\r\nNew York Stock Exchange are better enforced than the laws of the State\r\nlegislature. Now all our early Anglo-Saxon law was law of that kind.\r\nAnd it was not written down for a great many centuries, and even after\r\nbeing first written it wasn't usual to affix any _penalty_; they were\r\nmere customs, but of an iron-bound nature--customs that were followed\r\nfar more devoutly than the masses of our people follow any of our\r\nwritten laws to-day. And their \"sanction\" was twofold: In the first\r\nplace, the sanction I have mentioned, universal custom, social\r\nostracism for breach. A second and very obvious sanction, that if you\r\ndo a thing that I don't like and think is against the law, I am going\r\nto knock you down or kill you if I can! That was a sanction, and a\r\nperfectly good one; and the question that arose, therefore, was not at\r\nall as to penalty for the law-breaker; it was whether there should be\r\na penalty for the law-breaker's being killed. That is the reason they\r\ndidn't have to have any penalty! In those days if there was a custom\r\nthat a certain tribe had a certain pasture, and a man of another tribe\r\npastured his cattle in that pasture, the first man would go to him and\r\nthey would have a fight, and if he killed him he would be, as we say,\r\narrested; then the matter would be inquired into by the kin of the\r\nmurdered man or neighbors, and if the killer could prove that the\r\nmurdered man had committed a breach of the law, he went off scot\r\nfree--so, as a matter of fact he would to-day, if it were justifiable\r\nhomicide. In other words, it was a question of whether it was\r\njustifiable homicide; and that brought in the question what the\r\nlaw was, and it was usually only in that way. For the law was but\r\nuniversal custom, and that custom had no _sanction_; but for breach\r\nof the custom anybody could make personal attack, or combine with his\r\nfriends to make attack, on the person that committed the breach, and\r\nthen, when the matter was taken up by the members of both tribes, and\r\nfinally by the Witenagemot as a judicial court, the question was, what\r\nthe law was; and if it was proved, for instance, that the law was that\r\nthere _was_ private property in that pasture belonging to the man who\r\ncommitted the murder he went off scot free. That was the working of\r\nthe old Anglo-Saxon law, and it was a great many centuries before the\r\nnotion of law changed in their minds from that. And this \"unwritten\r\nlaw\" perdures in the minds of many of the people to-day.\r\n\r\nSo it was that the Witenagemot--this Great Council of the realm--was\r\nprimarily judicial, in the first instance always judicial; that is, it\r\nnever made new laws. It got together to try people for the breach of\r\nlaw; and that incidentally brought up the validity of the old law, and\r\nthen decided whether old law was valid or not. In a sense, therefore,\r\nyou see they told what the law was, they announced it; but they never\r\nsupposed they were making new laws. That was the last thing they\r\nintended to do, and the last thing the people would have stood, had\r\nthey tried it.\r\n\r\nSo much for the growth of law, the origin of Anglo-Saxon law, as we\r\nunderstand it, and for representative government, and for the origin\r\nof Parliament. I doubt if there was any giving of new law, anything\r\nthat we should call _legislation_, made by the English Parliament,\r\nthen called the Witenagemot, before the Norman Conquest. I have never\r\nbeen able to find any. You find occasional announcements that the men\r\nof Kent \"shall have their liberties as they used to,\" and perhaps\r\nthere will be a statement of what those liberties were, in brief; but\r\nit is always clearly meant that they are stating the law as already\r\nexisting. How, then, did they invent a legislature?\r\n\r\nThe Roman law, the whole Roman system, as you know, was absolutely\r\ndistinct, and distinct in two great principles which have lasted down\r\nreally into modern times, and still divide Continental countries\r\nfrom Anglo-Saxon countries. What I call the first great principle is\r\nuniversal law--the principle that no officer of government, no high\r\nofficial, no general, no magistrate, no anybody, can do anything\r\nagainst the law without being just as liable, if he infringed upon a\r\nsubject's liberty, as the most humble citizen. That is a notion which\r\ndoes not yet exist on the Continent or any part of the world except\r\nEngland and the United States, and the countries or colonies copying\r\nafter them. In Germany, for instance, Dr. Gierke tells me it exists\r\nonly partially and by a modern constitution. This is the first great\r\ndifference; and the second one is the notion that laws are made by the\r\npeople only, with or without representative government. The notion\r\nof law as a custom is Teutonic; but on the Continent the Germans\r\nabandoned it. The Roman law was always law more as we moderns think of\r\nit; it was an _order_, addressed by the sovereign, or at least by a\r\npolitical superior, to a subject or to a political inferior; addressed\r\nin the form of definite writing, that is to say, a statute, and with a\r\nsanction, that is to say, a penalty, a threat as to what the sovereign\r\nwill do if the subject does not obey. That is the universal notion\r\nof Roman law, and it has so far affected certain English writers on\r\njurisprudence that I feel almost one should be warned against them.\r\nNot that their side isn't arguable, but the weight of English history\r\nseems the other way. Austin, for instance, was so much impressed with\r\nthe notion of law as an order from the sovereign to an inferior that\r\nhe practically, even when considering the English Constitution, adopts\r\nthat notion of law, and therefore arrives to some conclusions, as it\r\nseems to me, unwarranted, and certainly omits to note a great many\r\nthings that would be noted had he kept clearly the Anglo-Saxon theory\r\nof law in mind.\r\n\r\nNow the Normans, mind you, had purely Roman law. While they were in\r\nNormandy, being in France, they had imbibed or adopted Roman notions\r\nof law, perhaps because they were then first civilized. They had lost\r\ntheir old Saxon notions, if they had any, for they were, after all,\r\nof the same _race_ as the Saxons. Nevertheless, when they conquered\r\nEngland they brought just as much the notion of the Roman law into\r\nEngland as if they had been Caesar's legions. And that fact must\r\nalways be borne in mind, and that led to centuries of conflict in the\r\nmaking of English constitutional law. The first thing, of course, that\r\nthey tried to do, that the Norman kings tried to do, was to use law in\r\nthe Roman way; that is, to make the law themselves, from the king. For\r\nthat was another consequence of the Roman law, that not only was it an\r\norder by the sovereign power, but that this sovereign power was not in\r\ntheory a legislature, as it is with us to-day, but the sovereign; in\r\nFrance and the Continental countries laws were made in theory and in\r\npractice by the king. So the Normans came over with the Roman notion,\r\nin the first place, as to what law was, that it was a written, newly\r\nmade order of a sovereign, not a thing that had grown up and was part\r\nof the lives and customs of the people, but a thing made out of hand\r\nby the king; and, secondly, that it was made by the king and not by\r\nany legislature. And the first two or three centuries of English\r\nparliamentary history were mainly taken up, in the English Parliament,\r\nso far as it concerns the subject of our course here, in the contest\r\nbetween Parliament and the king as to who should make law and what\r\nlaw was. It took more than one century for the Parliament, after the\r\nNorman Conquest, to revive as a Parliament at all; then when it\r\ndid finally get together it took two or three centuries before it\r\nestablished the principle that it had anything to do with the making\r\nof law. The Norman kings regarded the Parliament as a mere method of\r\ngetting money from the people, hardly even as a Council when they\r\nsought for popular support; and yet it was through the fact that they\r\nso regarded Parliament that Parliament was enabled ultimately to\r\nacquire the law-making or the legislative power which exists in all\r\nour legislatures to-day. The king, in those days, derived his revenue\r\nmainly from his own land. It was not necessary for the government to\r\nhave any revenue except for what we should call the king's private\r\npurse. What was wanted for public expense was for two or three\r\nwell-recognized purposes, all purposes of defence. The old English\r\ntaxation system was in a sense no system. There wasn't any such thing\r\nas taxation. There was the \"threefold necessity\" as it was called. It\r\nwas necessary for the king to have money, horses, grain, supplies,\r\netc., to defend the kingdom, and to build forts, and to maintain\r\nbridges or defensive works; and that was the only object of taxation\r\nin those times. Those were the only \"aids\"--they were called\r\n\"aids\"--those were the only aids recognized. The first word for tax is\r\nan \"_aid_\", granted voluntarily, in theory at least, by the barons to\r\nthe king, and for these three purposes only. The king's private purse\r\nwas easily made up by the enormous land he held himself. Even to-day\r\nthe crown is probably the largest land-owner in the kingdom, but at\r\nthe time of the Conquest, and for many years afterward, he certainly\r\nowned an hundredfold as much, and that gave him enough revenue for his\r\npurse; of course, in those days, money for such things as education,\r\nhighways, police, etc., was entirely out of their mind. They were\r\nnot as yet in that state of civilization. So the king got along\r\nwell enough for his own income with the land he owned himself as\r\nproprietor. But very soon after the Norman Conquest the Norman kings\r\nbegan to want more money. Nominally, of course, they always said they\r\nwanted it for the defence of the realm. Then they wanted it, very\r\nsoon, for crusades; lastly, for their own favorites. They spent an\r\nenormous amount of money on crusades and in the French wars; later\r\nthey began to maintain--always abroad--what we should call standing\r\narmies, and they needed money for all those purposes. And money could\r\nyet be only got from the barons, the nobility, or at least the landed\r\ngentry, because the people, the agricultural laborers or serfs,\r\nvilleins, owned no land. Knights and barons paid part of the tax by\r\nfurnishing armed men, but still, as civilization increased, there was\r\na growing demand on the part of the Norman kings for money. Now\r\nthis money could be got only from the barons, and under the\r\nConstitution--and here we first have to use that phrase--it could only\r\nbe got from the barons by their consent. That is, the great barons of\r\nthe realm had always given these aids in theory voluntarily. The king\r\ngot them together, told them what he wanted, and they granted it; but\r\nstill it had to come from them, and in the desire to get money the\r\nNorman kings first called together the Great Council, first consulted\r\nthe parliament which afterward became their master. They made a\r\nlegislature by calling them together, although only for this purpose,\r\nto give them the power of getting more money; but when the Great\r\nCouncil was once together and the kings began to be more and more\r\ngrasping in their demands for money, the barons naturally wanted\r\nsomething on their side, and they would say to them: \"Well, yes--you\r\nshall have this aid--we will vote you this tax--but the men of England\r\nmust have such and such a law as they used to under Anglo-Saxon\r\ntimes.\" And they pretty soon got to using the word \"people\";\r\nthe \"people\" must have \"the liberties they had under Edward the\r\nConfessor\"; and time after time they would wring from a Norman king a\r\ncharter, or a concession, to either the whole realm or a certain part\r\nof the realm, of all the liberties and laws and customs that they\r\nhad under the old Saxon domination--and that ultimately resulted in\r\nbringing the whole free English law back. Thus, early law was custom;\r\nAnglo-Saxon law was _free_ custom; the English lost it under the\r\nConquest; and they got it back because the first Norman kings had to\r\ncall the council together, which grew into Parliament, which then,\r\nin voting their aids or taxes, demanded their \"old liberties\"; and\r\nfinally, after getting Magna Charta, after getting all their old Saxon\r\nliberties back, by easy transition, they began to say: \"We would make\r\ncertain regulations, ordinances, laws of our own\"; though we have not\r\nyet got to the time where the notion of making _new_ law, as a statute\r\nis now understood, existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nEARLY ENGLISH LEGISLATION AND MAGNA CHARTA\r\n\r\n\r\nParliament began avowedly to make new laws in the thirteenth century;\r\nbut the number of such laws concerning private relations--private\r\ncivil law--remained, for centuries, small. You could digest them all\r\ninto a book of thirty or forty pages. And even to Charles the First\r\nall the statutes of the realm fill but five volumes. The legislation\r\nunder Cromwell was all repealed; but the bulk, both under him and\r\nafter, was far greater. For legislation seems to be considered a\r\ndemocratic idea; \"judge-made law\" to be thought aristocratic. And so\r\nin our republic; especially as, during the Revolution, the sole power\r\nwas vested in our legislative bodies, and we tried to cover a still\r\nwider field, with democratic legislatures dominated by radicals. Thus\r\nat first the American people got the notion of law-making; of the\r\nmaking of new law, by legislatures, frequently elected; and in that\r\nmost radical period of all, from about 1830 to 1860, the time of\r\n\"isms\" and reforms--full of people who wanted to legislate and make\r\nthe world good by law, with a chance to work in thirty different\r\nStates--the result has been that the bulk of legislation in this\r\ncountry, in the first half of the last century, is probably one\r\nthousandfold the entire law-making of England for the five centuries\r\npreceding. And we have by no means got over it yet; probably the\r\noutput of legislation in this country to-day is as great as it ever\r\nwas. If any citizen thinks that anything is wrong, he, or she (as it\r\nis almost more likely to be), rushes to some legislature to get a new\r\nlaw passed. Absolutely different is this idea from the old English\r\nnotion of law as something already existing. They have forgotten\r\nthat completely, and have the modern American notion of law, as\r\na ready-made thing, a thing made to-day to meet the emergency of\r\nto-morrow. They have gotten over the notion that any parliament, or\r\nlegislature, or sovereign, should only _sign_ the law--and I say sign\r\nadvisedly because he doesn't enact it, doesn't create it, but signs a\r\nwritten statement of law already existing; all idea that it should be\r\njustified by custom, experiment, has been forgotten. And here is the\r\nneed and the value of this our study; for the changes that are being\r\nmade by new legislation in this country are probably more important\r\nto-day than anything that is being done by the executive or the\r\njudiciary--the other two departments of the government.\r\n\r\nBut before coming down to our great mass of legislation here it will\r\nbe wise to consider the early English legislation, especially that\r\npart which is alive to-day, or which might be alive to-day. I\r\nmentioned one moment ago thirty pages as possibly containing the bulk\r\nof it. I once attempted to make an abstract of such legislation in\r\nearly England as is significant to us to-day in this country;[1] not\r\nthe merely political legislation, for ours is a sociological study.\r\nWe are concerned with those statutes which affect private citizens,\r\nindividual rights, men and women in their lives and businesses; not\r\nmatters of state, of the king and the commons, or the constitution of\r\ngovernment. Except incidentally, we shall not go into executive or\r\npolitical questions, but the sociological--I wish there were some\r\nsimpler word for it--let us say, the _human_ legislation; legislation\r\nthat concerns not the government, the king, or the state, but each man\r\nin his relations to every other; that deals with property, marriage,\r\ndivorce, private rights, labor, the corporations, combinations,\r\ntrusts, taxation, rates, police power, and the other great questions\r\nof the day, and indeed of all time.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Federal and State Constitutions,\" book II, chap. 2.]\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the Conquest, it would hardly have been necessary\r\nto have enacted the legislation of the first two or three centuries at\r\nall. Its object mainly was political, that is, to enforce Saxon law\r\nfrom Norman kings. No change was made, nothing new was added. There\r\nwas, however, a little early Saxon legislation before the Conquest.\r\nThe best compilation is contained in Stubbs's \"Selected Charters.\" He\r\nsays that the earliest English written laws contained amendments of\r\nolder unwritten customs, or qualifications of those customs, when they\r\nwere gradually wearing out of popular recollection. Such documents are\r\ngenerally obscure. They require for their elucidation a knowledge\r\nof the customs they were intended to amend. That is as I told you:\r\neverybody was supposed to know the law, and early written statutes\r\nwere either mere compilations of already existing law, slight\r\nmodifications of them, or else in the nature of imposing various\r\npenalties--all of which assume that you know the law already. When\r\nthey attempted codification, which they did about twice before the\r\nConquest (especially under Edward the Confessor, for that reason he is\r\ncalled the Father of English law, the English Justinian, because he\r\nwas enough of a civilian to understand what a code was), King Edward\r\nmade the attempt to get a certain amount of law written out; but even\r\nthat would be very unintelligible if you tried to read it, for he\r\nassumed that one knew it all already, and it also is mainly in the\r\nnature of imposing penalties, not stating the law as it was. However,\r\nthat is called the first English code. All the Saxon laws Dr. Stubbs\r\ncould find fill only twenty-two pages of his small book; and he says\r\nthat English law, from its first to its latest phase, has never\r\npossessed an authoritative, constructive, systematic, or approximately\r\nexhaustive statement, such as was attempted by the great founders of\r\nthe civil or Continental law, by Justinian or by Napoleon Bonaparte.\r\nNow this is true, even to-day, of our English and our American law.\r\nThat is, the great bulk of the law that is administered in our courts\r\nis not \"written,\" it is not in any code. There are, of course,\r\ntext-books on the subject, but they are of no binding authority. It\r\nresides in the learning of the judges. It is what is called court-made\r\nlaw--\"_jus dicere_,\" not \"_jus dare_.\" Our judges are still supposed\r\nto tell what the law is, and they sometimes, as the common law is a\r\nvery elastic thing, have to make new law. That is, if the precise case\r\nisn't covered by any previous decision or by any statute, the judge\r\nor the court will say what the common law ought to be when applied\r\nto that state of facts. So our law is a continually growing law, and\r\nlargely made still in the old Saxon way, by custom and the judges, and\r\nstill under the theory that the common law is an existing thing; that\r\nthe law exists and the judge only expounds. We have never lost sight\r\nof that theory.\r\n\r\nThese early Anglo-Saxon laws mostly concern only matters of procedure\r\nfor the courts, or the scale of punishment. As they assume a knowledge\r\nof existing law, they are often hard to understand. Here are some of\r\nthe laws of Wessex:\r\n\r\n    A.D. 690. WESSEX KING INI.\r\n\r\n    CAP. 11. \"If any one sell his own countryman, bond or free, though\r\n    he be guilty, over sea, let him pay for him according to his\r\n    'wer.'\"\r\n\r\nAs to \"wer.\" Now there were slaves in England in those days; at the\r\ntime of the Conquest the Domesday Book reports twenty-five thousand.\r\n_Slaves_, I mean; not the unfree agricultural laborers, they were in a\r\nhigher class, but the regularly bound _slaves_, who were descendants,\r\neither of the early British inhabitants or of the Saxons themselves,\r\nwho had been punished in the courts and had been sentenced into\r\nslavery, or men who had voluntarily sold themselves into slavery. For\r\nunder early Saxon law a man could sell his child into slavery if the\r\nchild were under seven years old, and above fourteen the child could\r\nsell himself. This refers, of course, to that; it is really a kind of\r\npredecessor of our Thirteenth Amendment; that is, it forbids slavery;\r\nit forbids making new slaves. The word \"wer\" is the word we have in\r\n\"wer-wolf,\" meaning blood; for instance, \"weregild\" is a man's blood\r\nmoney. Every man had a price from the king down; if a man killed the\r\nking he had to pay, we will say, fifty thousand pounds; if a thane,\r\nit might be one or two thousand; if an ordinary freeman, one hundred\r\npounds, and so on.\r\n\r\n    CAP. 36. \"Let him who takes a thief, or to whom one taken is\r\n    given, and he then lets him go, or conceals the theft, pay for\r\n    the thief according to his 'wer.' If he be an ealdorman, let him\r\n    forfeit his shire, unless the king is willing to be merciful to\r\n    him.\"\r\n\r\nNow the earliest direct legislation about personal property in a\r\nstatute is as late as 1100; but this early Saxon law was a recognition\r\nof personal property, because a man cannot steal a thing unless there\r\nis property. This section, therefore, implies property in personalty;\r\nbecause a man cannot steal land; but it never occurred to them to pass\r\na law saying that there _shall be_ private property, because that was\r\nthe unwritten law that they were all supposed to know.\r\n\r\n    A.D. 890. WESSEX. ALFRED.\r\n\r\n    CAP. 27. \"If a man, kinless of paternal relatives, fight and slay\r\n    a man, and then if he have maternal relatives, let them pay a\r\n    third of the 'wer'; his guild-brethren a third part; for a\r\n    third let him flee. If he have no maternal relatives, let his\r\n    guild-brethren pay half, for half let him flee.\"\r\n\r\n    CAP. 28. \"If a man kill a man thus circumstanced, if he have\r\n    no relatives, let half be paid to the king, half to his\r\n    guild-brethren.\"\r\n\r\nIt is very hard for us to understand what that means. One would\r\ninfer that the weregild was only paid by a man with relatives on his\r\nfather's side. It doesn't say that, but that is the inference. We\r\nshall have plenty to say about the guilds later--the historical\r\npredecessors of the modern trades-unions. We here find the word\r\n_guild_ recognized and spoken of in the law as early as 890.\r\n\r\n    A.D. 920. WESSEX. EDWARD.\r\n\r\n    \"2. And if a ceorl throve, so that had fully five hides of his\r\n    own land, church and kitchen, bell-house and burh-gate-seat,\r\n    and special duty in the king's hall, then was he thenceforth of\r\n    thegn-right worthy.\r\n\r\n    \"6. And if a merchant throve, so that he fared thrice over the\r\n    wide sea by his own means, then was he thenceforth of thegn-right\r\n    worthy.\"\r\n\r\nWorldly success has thus always been the foundation of English\r\nnobility.\r\n\r\nThen there is a good deal about how much you have to pay for a churl,\r\nand how much for an earl, and so on, leaving out only the slaves; for\r\nall the free people of England in Saxon times were divided into earls\r\nand churls; that is, noblemen and agricultural laborers or yeomanry;\r\nthese were the two estates besides the church, always a class by\r\nitself. Later there grew up the thanes, who were merely large\r\nlandlords; the law became that a man that had five hides of land, five\r\nor six hundred acres, with a farm, should by the mere fact of having\r\nthat land become a thane, an earl. That method of ennobling a man by\r\nland got to be a way, at that time the only way, by which a churl or a\r\nvillein could become a nobleman or even be emancipated. Exactly as now\r\nwith our American Indians; when an Indian gets one hundred and sixty\r\nacres given to him in severalty he becomes, under the Dawes Act, a\r\ncitizen of the United States. Later there grew up emancipation by the\r\nguilds. The word _guild_ meant the members of a certain handicraft,\r\nbut that was rather the secondary meaning; it originally meant the\r\nfreemen of the town. But the freemen of the towns were made up of\r\nthe freemen of the guilds. No one could become a member of the guild\r\nwithout going through certain ceremonies, much as he would now to join\r\na trades-union; and no one could become a freeman of the town unless\r\nhe was a freeman of the guild. The law grew to be, however, that if a\r\nman succeeded in staying in a town for a year and a day, without being\r\nturned out, plying his handicraft, he became by that mere fact a\r\nfreeman of the town; for the citizens of towns established their\r\nliberty, both personal and political, far earlier than the dwellers on\r\nagricultural land.\r\n\r\n    959-975-EDGAR.\r\n\r\n    CAP. 1. \"_Secular Ordinance_. Now this is the secular ordinance\r\n    which I will that it be held. This, then, is first what I will:\r\n    that every man be worthy of folk-right, as well poor as rich;\r\n    and that righteous dooms be judged to him; and let there be such\r\n    remission in the 'bot' as may be becoming before God and tolerable\r\n    before the world.\"\r\n\r\n    1016. CANUTE.\r\n\r\n    CAP. 71. \"And if any one depart this life intestate, be it through\r\n    his neglect, be it through sudden death; then let not the lord\r\n    draw more from his property than his lawful heriot. And according\r\n    to his direction, let the property be distributed very justly to\r\n    the wife and children and relations, to every one according to the\r\n    degree that belongs to him.\"\r\n\r\n    CAP. 81. \"And I will that every man be entitled to his hunting in\r\n    wood and in field, on his own possession. And let every one forego\r\n    my hunting: take notice where I will have it untrespaesed on under\r\n    penalty of the full 'wite.'\"\r\n\r\nBut even the great code of Edward the Confessor has, for the most\r\npart, to do only with political divisions, what shall be a shire, what\r\na parish, etc., and certain technical matters that have now grown\r\nobsolete. So we may conclude with the statement, substantially\r\naccurate, that there was practically no _new_ legislation, no\r\nconstructive legislation under the Saxons; their social law was all\r\nunwritten.\r\n\r\nAnd Parliament did not begin by being a law-making body. Its\r\nlegislative functions were not very active, as they were confined to\r\ndeclaring what the law was; more important were its executive and\r\njudicial functions. In modern English government, particularly in our\r\nown, one of the basic principles is that of the three departments,\r\nexecutive, legislative, and judicial; the Norman or Roman theory\r\nrather reposed all power in one; that is, in the sovereign, commonly,\r\nof course, the king, the others being theoretically his advisers or\r\nservants. In England, to-day, the real sovereign is the Parliament;\r\nthe merest shadow of sovereignty is left to the executive, the king,\r\nand none whatever given the judicial branch. In this country we\r\npreserve the three branches distinct, though none, not all three\r\ntogether, are sovereign; it is the people who are that. And each\r\ndepartment is of equal dignity; although at one period there was a\r\ncertain amount of public complaint that Congress was usurping more\r\npower than belongs to it, and recently that power was being usurped by\r\nthe president, there has hardly been (except from Mr. Gompers and Mr.\r\nHearst) any complaint that power is usurped by the _judicial_ branch,\r\nhowever unpopular its decisions. But in England there is no pretence\r\nof maintaining the three branches uniform either in importance or in\r\npower. Starting with the Great Council, which had originally only a\r\ncertain amount of executive power and a great deal of judicial power,\r\nthey have retained and added to the former, while practically giving\r\nup the latter; and, moreover, they have divided into the two houses,\r\nthe House of Lords and the House of Commons, with a division of\r\nsovereignty between them, the Commons, of course, getting the lion's\r\nshare. The only judicial power substantially now remaining in the\r\nEnglish Parliament is the power of impeachment, which is rarely\r\nexercised in England, and the appellate jurisdiction of the House\r\nof Lords, of the \"law\" lords, that is, those peers who held legal\r\noffices. On the other hand the legislative function of Parliament,\r\nwhich began merely in the way of saying what the law was, has\r\nenormously developed, and still more so the executive. Thus the\r\nlegislative branch of the three divisions in the English government\r\nhas increased out of all proportion to both the others, having now all\r\nthe legislative power and most of the executive. And legislatively it\r\nis omnipotent; it is confined by no constitution; even the king cannot\r\nwithhold his consent. Parliament can make any law, although against\r\nwhat _was_ the Constitution; the Constitution may be modified by a\r\nsimple statute. So their legislative function is infinite; and their\r\nexecutive function has, in substance, grown very large, because the\r\nBritish government is carried on by the cabinet, which is practically\r\na committee of the House of Commons. But of the judicial function,\r\nwhich was the principal function of the Great Council at the time\r\nof the Conquest, hardly a shred remains. It is the history of all\r\ncountries that people are not jealous of the judicial power, while\r\nthey are extremely anxious to seize the legislative and executive.\r\nWith us, however, we are supposed to have all three functions\r\nco-ordinate and in good working activity. But in both countries, money\r\nbills, bills imposing taxes, are the function of the lower house. That\r\nprinciple grew historically from the principle that all taxation must\r\nbe voted by the people, directly or indirectly; must be with the\r\ncommon consent and for the common benefit. That principle was\r\nestablished by the House of Commons, and consequently they arrogated\r\nto themselves that part of the legislative power. That principle we\r\nhave retained in our Federal Constitution, and in most of our State\r\nconstitutions; all of which have the double house.\r\n\r\nThe first functions of Parliament were restricted to voting taxes.\r\nThe king called the barons together merely to get \"aids,\" and they\r\nwouldn't give them until he recognized what they chose to call the old\r\nlaw of England, always a pre-existing law. It was still a long time\r\nbefore there was constructive legislation. Just as, before the\r\nConquest, in the seventh century, we find it said of the law of\r\nWihtred: \"Then the great lords with the consent of all came to a\r\nresolution upon these ordinances and added them to the customary\r\nlaws of the men of Kent\"; and, in the time of King Alfred: \"I, then,\r\nAlfred, king, gathered these [laws] together, and commanded many of\r\nthose to be written which our forefathers held, those which to me\r\nseemed good; and many of those which seemed to me not good I rejected\r\nthem, by the counsel of my 'witan,' and they then said that it seemed\r\ngood to them all to be holden\";[1] so, after the Conquest, every\r\nNorman king was made on his coronation oath to promise this, the law\r\nof Edward the Confessor, until Magna Charta; after that they promised\r\nto respect Magna Charta instead, which was thus reissued or confirmed\r\nthirty-two times in the eighty-two years which intervened between\r\nRunnymede and the final Confirmation of Charters under Edward I. Thus,\r\nWilliam the Conqueror himself, in his charter to the city of London,\r\nsays, in Anglo-Saxon: \"_And I do you to wit that I will that ye two be\r\nworthy of all the laws that ye were worthy of in King Edward's day_.\"\r\nSo the Domesday Book records \"_the customs_,\" that is to say,\r\nthe laws, of various towns and counties; these bodies of customs\r\ninvariably containing a mere list of penalties for the breach of the\r\nestablished law; while later charters usually give the inhabitants of\r\na town all the customs and free privileges enjoyed by the citizens of\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Stubbs's \"Charters,\" p. 62.]\r\n\r\nBut after the Conquest laws could only be enacted with the concurrence\r\nof the king; and the phrase was, and is still, in form, that \"the\r\nking wills it\"--_Le Roy le veult_. Nevertheless, Parliament usually\r\noriginated laws. The early Norman kings cared nothing about\r\nlegislation; their sole desire was to get money from the people. For\r\ntwo centuries, therefore, Parliament was occupied only with laws\r\nrecognizing the old Anglo-Saxon laws previously existing, or laws\r\nremoving abuses of the royal power; and the desire of the king to tax\r\nthe people was used as the lever to get him to assent to these laws.\r\n\r\nWith the usual sensible indifference of the English race to mere\r\nmatters of form, they allowed the Norman kings to go on declaring the\r\nlaws and signing them as if they were made only by the crown, which\r\nwas the Norman theory--not caring for the shadow, if they could get\r\nthe substance. Thus they established, in the first two or three\r\ncenturies, the right to force legislation on the king, and they did it\r\nby the instrument of the taxation power. For taxation must be \"by the\r\ncommon consent of the realm\"; no taxation without representation, as\r\nthe Declaration of Independence puts it, is probably the earliest\r\nprinciple of the English Constitution; and it is most significant to\r\nthe student of the constitutional law, a most necessary reminder to\r\nthose who do not value our Constitution, that it was the departure\r\nby George III from this very earliest of English constitutional\r\nprinciples that caused the loss of his American empire.\r\n\r\nThis was six hundred years old, therefore, at the time of our\r\nRevolution. Except those two principles, taxation by common consent\r\nand taxation for the common benefit--which latter was not finally\r\nestablished until two hundred years later (that is, it was put in the\r\nfirst Magna Charta, John's, and then quietly dropped out by Henry II,\r\nand kept out of the charter for nearly one hundred years),--we have to\r\ncome down to the year 1100 before we find the first _sociological_\r\nstatute. \"Henry I called another convention of all the estates of the\r\nrealm to sit in his royal palace at London ... the prohibiting the\r\npriests the use of their wives and concubines was considered, and the\r\nbishops and clergy granted to the king the correction of them for that\r\noffence; by which means he raised vast sums of money compounding with\r\nthe priests....\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Cobbett's \"Parliamentary History of England,\" I, 4.]\r\n\r\nIn 1 Henry, cap. VII, is another recognition of personal property--it\r\nsays that at a man's death it is to be divided between his widow and\r\nhis heirs. Now that may seem commonplace enough; but it is interesting\r\nto note, as in the law, personal property did not come first; property\r\nin land was many centuries earlier. And this suggests the legal basis\r\nand present tendency of the law of property. \"Property exists only\r\nby the law\"; and extreme socialists say that all private property is\r\nrobbery. No law, no property; this is true. Property is an artificial\r\nthing. It is a creation of law. In other words, where there is now no\r\nlaw except statute, it is the creation of statute. That may sound a\r\ncommonplace, but is not, when you remember that socialists, who are\r\nattacking property, do so on precisely that ground. They say it is a\r\nfictitious thing, it is a matter of expediency, it is a matter which\r\nwe can recognize or not, as we like; \"no law, no property,\" and they\r\nask us to consider whether, on the whole, it is a good thing to have\r\nany property at all, or whether the state had not better own all the\r\nproperty. But our Federal and State constitutions guard it expressly.\r\n\r\nThus, property is the very earliest legal concept expressed in\r\nstatutes, just as it is perhaps the earliest notion that gets into a\r\nchild's mind. And ownership of land preceded _personal_ property--for\r\nthe perfectly simple reason that there was very little personal\r\nproperty until comparatively late in civilization, and for the other\r\nmore significant reason that an Anglo-Saxon freeman didn't bother with\r\nlaw when he had his good right hand. In the fifth, sixth, and seventh\r\ncenturies, when we were barbarous tribes, a man's personal property\r\nconsisted chiefly in his spear, his weapons, or his clothes; enemies\r\nwere not very apt to take them, and if they did, he was prepared to\r\ndefend them. Then, cattle, in those days, belonged to the tribe and\r\nnot to the individual. So, I should fancy, of ships--that is, galleys,\r\nnot private \"coracles,\" the earliest British boats. Consequently there\r\nwasn't any need for a law as to personal property. What little there\r\nwas could be easily defended. But with land it was different. Property\r\nin land was recognized both among the English and, of course, with the\r\nNormans; and in ways so similar that it was very easy for the Normans\r\nto impose the feudal system upon England. There had been no feudal\r\nsystem before the Norman Conquest; there were then three kinds of\r\nland: the rare and exceptional _individual_ land, owned by one\r\nman--always a freeman, not a villein or slave--and this was very small\r\nin extent, limited to a very few acres around a man's home. Most of\r\nthe land was held in common; the folgland, so-called, which belonged\r\nto the tribe; the land on which the cows of the village were pastured.\r\nAnd finally there was the public, or unappropriated, or waste land.\r\nMost of this last was seized, after the Conquest, by the big feudal\r\nlords. For they came in with their feudal system; and the feudal\r\nsystem recognized no absolute ownership in individuals. Under it there\r\nwere also three kinds of land, and much the same as the Saxon, only\r\nthe names were different: there was the crown land--now I am speaking\r\nEnglish and not Norman-French--which belonged to the king and which he\r\nprobably let out most profitably; there was the manor, or the feudal\r\nland, which was owned by the great lords, and was not let by the king\r\ndirectly; and then there was the vacant land, the waste land, which\r\nwas in a sense unappropriated. Now all the Norman kings had to do was\r\nto bring the feudal system over the Saxon law of land, so that the\r\ntribal land remained the only private land--that which is called \"boke\r\nland.\" This is land such as all our land is to-day, except land like\r\nour Cambridge Common. With a very few exceptions, all our land is\r\n\"boke\" land--freehold land. Then there was the public land; but that\r\nvery soon was taken by the lords and let out to their inferiors; this\r\nwas the great bulk of land in England after the Norman Conquest.\r\nLastly again there was the crown land, out of which the king got his\r\nrevenue. As something like this threefold system of land existed\r\nbefore the Conquest, a subtle change to the feudal system was\r\ncomparatively easy by a mere change of name.\r\n\r\nIn the same year--1100--is the Charter of \"Liberties\" of Henry I. It\r\nrestores the laws of Edward the Confessor \"with the amendments made by\r\nmy father with the counsel of his barons.\" It promises in the first\r\nsection relief to the kingdom of England from all the evil customs\r\nwhereby it had lately been oppressed, and finally returns to the\r\npeople the laws of Edward the Confessor, \"with such emendations as my\r\nfather made with the consent of his barons.\"[1] In his charter to the\r\ncitizens of London[2] he promises general freedom from feudal taxes\r\nand impositions, from dane-geld and from the fine for the murder of\r\na Norman; and the Charter of Liberties issued by Henry II in 1154\r\nconfirms their \"liberties and free customs to all men in the\r\nkingdom.\"[3] From this dates the equality of Englishmen before the\r\nlaw, commons as well as barons. Henry II was the first Norman king who\r\nhad the old Saxon blood, and therefore he was looked forward to with a\r\ngreat deal of enthusiasm by the people of England. For although it is\r\nonly one hundred years after the Conquest, the Normans and the Saxons\r\nhad pretty well fused, and the Normans, who were inferior in number,\r\nhad got thoroughly imbued with the free notion of Anglo-Saxon law. So\r\nthey got this charter from him; but there is no legislation to concern\r\nus in it, it is only political. It has a great deal to do with the\r\nchurch, and with what the king will not do; it binds him, but it does\r\nnot state any law directly.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Stubbs's \"Charters,\" p. 101 (clause 13).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 108.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Ibid_., p. 135.]\r\n\r\nThere is further a continued evidence of the efforts of the people to\r\nrestore the common law of England as against the king's law or Roman\r\nlaw, or later against the law of the church, also a kind of Roman law\r\nknown as canon law; and later still against the law of the king's\r\nchancellor, what we should now call chancery jurisdiction; for the\r\njealousy of chancery procedure was quite as great in the twelfth\r\ncentury as it is with the most radical labor leaders to-day; but of\r\nthis later on.\r\n\r\nIn 1159 they succeeded in doing away with the Norman method of trying\r\ncases by battle and the Saxon method of trying by oath, and by the\r\nmachinery of the Norman Great Assize introduced again trial by jury.\r\nFor this in itself is probably an old Saxon institution. And in 1164\r\ncame the great Constitutions of Clarendon, the principal object of\r\nwhich was to free the people from the church law and subject\r\nthe priests to the ordinary common law as in times before the\r\nConquest--for now, \"as the influence of the Italian lawyers\r\nincreased,\"[1] all the priests and clergy were above it. It was the\r\nfirst great statute which clearly subjected the church--which, of\r\ncourse, was the Church of Rome--to the common secular law. There was a\r\nvast jurisdiction of church law (\"Doctors commons\" courts lasted until\r\na generation ago in England); some of it still remains. But in these\r\nearly days all matters concerning marriage, divorce, guardianship of\r\nchildren, ownership of property after death, belonged to church law.\r\nIt is hard to see why, except that the mediaeval church arrogated\r\nto itself anything that concerned _sin_ in any way--anything that\r\nconcerned the relation of the sexes, that concerned the Holy\r\nSacraments, and marriage is a sacrament. Consequently the mediaeval\r\nchurch claimed that it had jurisdiction over all marriage, and over\r\nall divorce; and also took jurisdiction over a man's children at his\r\ndeath, and over his property, now exercised by our courts of probate.\r\nThis they got out of the notion that when a man was dead, there was\r\nsomething, in a sense, that went beyond this life in looking after his\r\nproperty and children. And down until twenty or thirty years ago all\r\njurisdiction in England in matters which concerned a man's property,\r\nafter death, belonged to the church courts and their successors. The\r\nchurch law was based on the Roman law, but was called _canon_ law,\r\nthe technical word, because it is the \"canons\" of the church. It is a\r\nconvenient term to distinguish it from the ordinary civil law of the\r\nContinent. So that the Constitutions of Clarendon began what was\r\ncompleted only under Henry VIII; they very clearly asserted the claim\r\nof the king to be supreme over the Church of England. The Bishop of\r\nRome, as Henry VIII called the pope, had no more power than any other\r\nforeign bishop.[2] There still remained the institution known as\r\nbenefit of clergy, by which any priest, or later any clerk or cleric\r\n(which word came to mean any one who could read and write) could\r\nget off of any criminal accusation, at first even murder, by simply\r\npleading his clergy; in which case the worst that could happen to him\r\nwas that he was branded in the right hand. But the Constitutions of\r\nClarendon were a great step toward civil liberty. Taken by us in 1164,\r\nit was followed in so neighboring a country as France only so late as\r\na few years ago. The priests, however, still managed to retain their\r\njurisdiction over offences among themselves, as well as over marriage,\r\nthe relation between the sexes, slander, usury, and wills--of matters\r\nrelating to the sacraments, and of sins.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Stubbs, p. 136.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Yet \"Peter's Pence\" were initiated by Ini, King of the\r\nWest Saxons, about 690!]\r\n\r\nNow this is a very interesting matter, and were it borne in mind by\r\nour modern legislators they would escape a good deal of unintelligent\r\nlegislation; that is, the distinction between a sin and a crime. A sin\r\nis against the church, or against one's conscience; matter, therefore,\r\nfor the priest, or one's spiritual adviser. A crime is an offence\r\nagainst other men; that is, against the state, in which all are\r\nconcerned. Under the intelligent legislation of the twelfth century\r\nall matters which were _sins_, which concerned the conscience, were\r\nleft to the church to prevent or punish. For the same reason usury was\r\nmatter for the priest--because it was regarded under the doctrines\r\nof the Bible as a sin. This notion prevailed down to the early\r\nlegislation of the colony of Massachusetts, though doubtless many\r\nthings which were then considered sins would now be regarded\r\nas crimes, such as bigamy, for instance. The distinction is,\r\nnevertheless, a valid one, and we shall have occasion frequently to\r\nrefer to it. We shall find that the defect of much of our modern\r\nlegislation--prohibition laws, for instance--is that they attempt to\r\ntreat as crimes, as offences against the state, matters which are\r\nmerely sins, offences against the conscience or the individual who\r\ncommits them.\r\n\r\nTo-day, the American constitutions all say that a militia is the\r\nnatural defence of a state of free men. It is interesting; therefore,\r\nto find, hardly a century after the Norman Conquest. In 1181, the\r\nAssize of Arms, which revived the ancient Saxon \"Fyrd,\" the word for\r\nwhat we now call militia; and, twenty years before that, \"scutage\"\r\nreplaced military service. To the burdens of the feudal system,\r\ncompulsory military service and standing armies, our ancestors\r\nobjected from the very beginning. In a sense, scutage was the\r\nbeginning of taxation; but it was only a commutation for military\r\nservice, much as a man to-day might pay a substitute to go to war in\r\ntimes of draft. General taxation first appears in 1188 in the famous\r\nSaladin tithe, the first historical instance of the taxation of\r\npersonal property as distinct from a feudal burden laid upon land.\r\nThe object of this tax was to raise money for the crusade against\r\nthe Sultan Saladin. It was followed, five years later, by a tax of\r\none-fourth of every person's revenue or goods to ransom the king,\r\nRichard I having gone to this crusade against Saladin, and been\r\ncaptured on his return by his good friend and Christian ally, the\r\nEmperor of the Holy Roman Empire. It is interesting to note that the\r\nworth of the king in those days was considered exactly one-fourth of\r\nthe common wealth of England. John was less expensive; but he was not\r\ncaptured. He levied a tax ten years later of one-seventh part on the\r\nbarons, and one-thirteenth on every man.\r\n\r\nIn 1213 two important things happened. The high-water mark of\r\ndomination by the Roman Church is reached when King John surrendered\r\nEngland to the pope, and took it back as a fief of the pope for a\r\ntribute of one thousand marks. The same year the other early method\r\nof trial of lawsuits was abolished by the Lateran Council--trial by\r\nordeal. This was the only remaining Saxon method. The Norman trial by\r\nbattle had already been superseded by trial by jury; and from this\r\ntime on, in practice, no other method than a jury remains, though\r\ntrial by battle was not abolished by statute until the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nAnd then we come to Magna Charta. The first time it was granted was in\r\n1215 by John, but the charter always quoted is that promulgated ten\r\nyears later under Henry III. They were very nearly identical, but the\r\nimportant omission in the charter of Henry was in regard to \"scutage\"\r\n(\"no aid other than the three customary feudal aids shall be imposed\r\nwithout the common counsel of the kingdom\"); that, of course, is the\r\nprinciple we have discussed above, first put in writing in the charter\r\nof John. The barons claimed it as part of the unwritten law. But Henry\r\nIII in his charter cannily dropped it out--which is a trick still\r\nplayed by legislatures to-day. This Magna Charta was confirmed and\r\nratified something like thirty times between the time of its adoption\r\nunder John and the time it got established so completely that it\r\nwasn't necessary to ratify it any more. There are four sections of\r\nMagna Charta that are most important. Chapter 7, the establishment of\r\nthe widow's dower; of no great importance to us except as showing\r\nhow early the English law protected married women in their property\r\nrights. Chapter 13 confirmed the liberties and customs of London and\r\nother cities and seaports--which is interesting as showing how early\r\nthe notion of free trade prevailed among our ancestors. It gave\r\nrise to an immense deal of commercial law, which has always existed\r\nindependent of any act of Parliament. Chapter 17 provided that the\r\ncommon pleas court--that is, the ordinary trial court--should not\r\nfollow the king about, but be held at a place and time certain. That\r\nwas the beginning of our legal liberty; because before that the king\r\nused to travel about his realm with his justiciar, as they called his\r\nchief legal officer, and anybody who wanted to have a lawsuit had\r\nto travel around England and get the king to hear his case. But the\r\nuncertainty of such a thing made justice very difficult, so it was a\r\ngreat step when the leading court of the kingdom was to be held in a\r\nplace certain, which was at once established in Westminster. Minor\r\ncourts were, of course, later established in various counties, though\r\nusually the old Saxon county or hundred-motes continued to exist.\r\nChapter 12 is the one relating to scutage, from the word _scutum_,\r\nshield--meaning the service of armed men. Just as, to-day, a man who\r\ndoes not pay his taxes can in some States work them out on the road,\r\nso conversely in England they very early commuted the necessity of\r\na knight or land-owner furnishing so many armed men into a money\r\npayment. \"The three customary feudal aids\" were for the defence of the\r\nkingdom, the building of forts, and the building of bridges--all\r\nthe taxes usually imposed upon English citizens in these earliest\r\ntimes--all other taxation to be only by the Common Council of the\r\nkingdom. This is the first word, council; later, it became \"consent\";\r\nthe word _conseil_ meaning both consent and council. \"Council of\r\nEngland\" means, of course, the Great Council. We are still before the\r\ntime when the word Parliament was used. Thus Magna Charta expresses it\r\nthat there should be no taxation without \"the advice\" of Parliament,\r\nwithout legislation; and as Parliament was a representative body, it\r\nis the equivalent of \"taxation without representation.\" This also was\r\nomitted in Henry III's charter, 1217, and only restored under Edward\r\nI in 1297, a most significant omission. And it is also expressed in\r\nearly republications of the Great Charter that taxation must be for\r\nthe benefit of _all_, \"for public purposes only,\" for the people\r\nand not for a class. On this latter principle of Anglo-American\r\nconstitutional law one of our great political parties bases its\r\nobjection to the protective tariff, or to bounties; as, for instance,\r\nto the sugar manufacturers; or other modern devices for extorting\r\nwealth from all the people and giving it to the few. All taxation\r\nshall be for the _common_ benefit. Any taxation imposed for the sole\r\nbenefit of the land-owning class, for instance, or even for\r\nthe manufacturing class, is against the original principles of\r\nconstitutional liberty.\r\n\r\nThen we come to chapter 39, the great \"Liberty\" statute. \"No freeman\r\nshall be taken or imprisoned or be disseised of his freehold or _his\r\nliberties or his free customs_ [these important words added in 1217]\r\nor be outlawed or exiled or otherwise destroyed but by lawful judgment\r\nof his peers, or by the law of the land.\" This, the right to law, is\r\nthe cornerstone of personal liberty. Any government in any country on\r\nthe Continent can seize a man and keep him as long as it likes; it is\r\nonly Anglo-Saxons that have an absolute right not to have that happen\r\nto them, and not only are they entitled not to be imprisoned, but\r\ntheir liberty of free locomotion may not be impeded. An American\r\ncitizen has a constitutional right to travel freely through the\r\nwhole republic and also not to be excluded therefrom. Punishment by\r\nbanishment beyond the four seas was forbidden in very early times in\r\nEngland. \"Disseised of his freehold, of his liberties or his free\r\ncustoms\"--that is the basis of all our modern law of freedom of trade,\r\nagainst restraint of trade, and the basis on which our actions against\r\nthe modern trusts rest; the right to freely engage in any business, to\r\nbe protected against monopoly either of the state or brought about\r\nby competitors, to freely make one's own contracts, for labor or\r\nproperty, to work as long as one chooses, for what wages one wills,\r\nand all the other liberties of labor and trade. \"Or be outlawed or\r\nexiled or otherwise destroyed\"--that is a broad general phrase for any\r\ninterference with a man's property, life, or liberty. \"Nor will we go\r\nupon him\"--that has been translated in various ways, but it means what\r\nit says; it means that the king won't descend upon a man personally or\r\nwith his army; nor will we \"send upon him\"--a law officer after\r\nhim; \"but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of the\r\nland\"--that means jury trial, or at least the law of the land, as it\r\nthen was; and that phrase, or its later equivalent--due process of\r\nlaw--is discussed to-day probably in one case out of every ten that\r\narise in our highest courts. Many books have been written upon it.\r\nTo start with, it means that none of these things can be done except\r\n_under law_; that is, except under a lawsuit; except under a process\r\nin a court, having jury trial if it be a civil case, and also\r\nan indictment if it be a criminal case, with all the rights and\r\nconsequences that attend a regularly conducted lawsuit. It must be\r\ndone by the courts, and not by the executive, not by the mere will of\r\nthe king; and, still more important to us to-day, not by legislatures,\r\nnot even by Parliament. \"We will sell to no man, we will deny or delay\r\nto no man, either right or justice,\" needs no explanation; it is\r\nequality before the law, repeated in our own Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nLastly, we have in cap. 41: \"Merchants shall have safe conduct in\r\nEngland, subject only to the ancient and allowed customs, not to evil\r\ntolls\"--a forecast of the allowable tariff as well as of the spirit\r\nof modern international law. Finally, there is a chapter on mortmain,\r\nrecognizing that land might not be given to monasteries or religious\r\nhouses, and particularly under a secret trust; the object being to\r\nkeep the land, which made the power of the realm, out of the hands of\r\nthe church. As far as that part of it goes, it is merely historical to\r\nus, but it developed into the principle that corporations \"which have\r\nno souls,\" and do not die, should not own too much land, or have too\r\nmuch power--and that is a very live question in the United States\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nOne must not be misled by the generality of the phrase used in chapter\r\n39, and think it unimportant because it looks simple. It is hard for\r\nan American or Englishman to get a fresh mind on these matters. We all\r\ngrow up with the notion that nobody has the right to arrest us, nobody\r\nhas the right to deprive us of our liberty, even for an hour. If\r\nanybody, be he President of the United States or be he a police\r\nofficer, chooses to lay his hand on our shoulder or attempts to\r\nconfine us, we have the same right to try him, if he makes a mistake,\r\nas if he were a mere trespasser; and that applies just as much to the\r\nhighest authority, to the president, to the general of the army, to\r\nthe governor, as it does to a tramp. But one cannot be too often\r\nreminded that this principle is peculiar to English and American\r\ncivilization. Throughout the Continent any official, any judge,\r\nanybody \"who has a red band around his cap,\" who, in any indirect way,\r\nrepresents the state--a railway conductor, a spy, a station agent--not\r\nonly has the right to deprive you of your freedom, but you have no\r\nright to question him; the \"red band around the cap\" is a final\r\nanswer. Hence that extraordinary incident, at which all England\r\nlaughed, the Kupenick robbery. A certain crook who had been a soldier\r\nand was familiar with the drill and the passwords, obtained possession\r\nof an old captain's uniform, walked into a provincial town of some\r\nimportance, ordered the first company of soldiers he met to follow\r\nhim, and then with that retinue, appeared before the town hall and\r\ndemanded of the mayor the keys of the treasury. These were surrendered\r\nwithout question and he escaped with the money, representing, of\r\ncourse, that he had orders from the Imperial government. It never\r\noccurred to any one to question a soldier in full uniform, and it was\r\nonly some days later, when the town accounts were sent to Berlin to be\r\napproved, that the robbery was discovered.\r\n\r\nSuch a thing could by no possibility have happened in England or with\r\nus; the town treasurer would at once have demanded his authority, his\r\norder from the civil authorities; the uniform would have failed to\r\nimpress him. Moreover, under our local self-government, under our\r\ndecentralized system, nobody is _above_ even a town officer, or a\r\nState or city official at the head of his department, however small it\r\nbe, except the courts. State officers may not command town officers,\r\nnor Federal officers State officers; nor soldiers give orders to\r\npolicemen. The president, the governor, may perhaps remove them; but\r\nthat is all. And even the policeman acts at his peril, and may be sued\r\nin the ordinary courts, if he oversteps his authority. The notion that\r\na free citizen has a right absolutely to question his constraint by\r\nany State officer is peculiar to the English and American people, and\r\nthis cannot be too often repeated; for it is what foreigners simply\r\nfail to understand. And it rests on this chapter in the Great Charter,\r\noriginally, as amplified and explained by the courts and later acts of\r\nParliament, such, as the Habeas Corpus Act. If a man is arrested by\r\nany official, that person, however great, has to justify the arrest.\r\nIn theory, a man arrested has a right to sue him for damages, and\r\nto sue him criminally for trespass; and if that man, be he private\r\nindividual or be he an official or president, cannot show by a \"due\r\ncourse of law\"--that is, by a due lawsuit, tried with a jury--that he\r\ndid it under a duly enacted law, and that the facts of the case were\r\nsuch as to place the man under that law--then that official, however\r\nhigh, is just as much liable in the ordinary courts, as if he were the\r\nmerest footpad trying to stop a man on the highway--a doctrine almost\r\nunknown to any country in the world outside of England, the United\r\nStates, and English colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nRE-ESTABLISHMENT OF ANGLO-SAXON LAW\r\n\r\n\r\nGoing on with the statutes, the next thing we will note is a matter\r\nthat concerns the personal relations. It shows again how eagerly our\r\nEnglish common law overruled the church law, the canon law. Although\r\nthe church under the pope always pretended that it alone had authority\r\nto regulate relations between the sexes, marriage and divorce, we\r\nfound Henry I interfering with the priests themselves, and we now find\r\nas early as 1235, a secular statute which extends the interference of\r\nthe secular law over the relations between parent and child; that is,\r\nas to when a child should be legitimate and when not. We shall have a\r\ngreat deal to say later about marriage and divorce laws, particularly\r\ndivorce laws as they exist in this country and as they apparently are\r\ngoing to be. As early as 1235 the secular courts interfered with the\r\nmarriage relation; and the importance of that is here: there is one\r\ngreat school to-day, including largely clergymen and the divorce\r\nreformers, so-called, who hold substantially that marriage is a\r\nsacrament, or at least a status; that the secular law has nothing to\r\ndo with it and should not be allowed to grant a divorce except for\r\ncanonical causes, _i.e._, causes recognized by the church; that it\r\nis not like any other contract, which can be set aside with mutual\r\nconsent; when a marriage takes place, they say, it is a sacrament,\r\nor, at least, a status ensues which cannot in future be altered.\r\nConsequently, it is not like a contract; for all contracts can be\r\nabrogated by mutual consent. On the other hand, the most radical\r\npeople go to the other extreme, and say that marriage _is_ like any\r\nother contract; it is purely a civil contract, not a sacrament, not\r\na status; just like any other, and some of them go to what is the\r\nlogical conclusion of that position and say that therefore marriage,\r\nlike any other contract, ought to be ended at any time by the consent\r\nof both parties. The extreme radical view leads to the conclusion that\r\na man and woman ought to be divorced any time by merely saying that\r\nthey want to be; and some States have almost got to this position in\r\ntheir statutes. This may seem a very far cry from this early statute,\r\nwhich does not directly concern marriage but the status of children;\r\nnevertheless it has this bearing--it is an interference by Parliament,\r\nby the secular, legislative branch of government, with a relation\r\nwhich the church believed to belong only to the church. It so happens\r\nthat in this instance the secular law instead of being liberal and\r\nkindly was extremely cruel and the reverse of liberal. Under the\r\nchurch law, when a man married a woman by whom he already had\r\nchildren, all those children were thereby made legitimate, and that\r\ncertainly seems the kindly and the Christian law. But the secular\r\nbarons who constituted the Parliament, in their jealousy for the\r\ncommon law, took the harsher view, that any children born of parents\r\nwho are not married at the time they are born shall be illegitimate,\r\nalthough their parents may marry afterward. Beaumont and Fletcher, in\r\none of their plays, make a punning reference to that. It seems to have\r\nstruck Beaumont and Fletcher as it does us, that it was a cruel law\r\nfor the Parliament to make; when the church for once was liberal, it\r\nwas queer that the Parliament should be illiberal; so Beaumont and\r\nFletcher, in one of their plays, say: \"The children thou shalt get\r\n_by this civilian_ cannot inherit by the _law_.\" This is interesting,\r\nbecause they use all the words I have been trying to define; when they\r\nsay \"the children thou shalt get by this _civilian_,\" they mean by\r\nthis civilian a person who is under the civil, or Roman, or church\r\nlaw; that is, they mean to say, although you marry a woman who is\r\na church member and under the jurisdiction of the bishop, etc.,\r\nnevertheless the church law won't help you; your children by her\r\ncannot inherit by the _law_, and the law as used by Beaumont and\r\nFletcher and as used by me and as used in English books means the\r\n_common_ law, the common _secular_ law, the law of _England_, not the\r\ncivil or canon law.[1] Beaumont and Fletcher evidently thought it was\r\na very illiberal statute; and our modern American States have all come\r\nto Beaumont and Fletcher's conclusion; they have universally reversed\r\nthe old English statute and gone back to the church law, so that\r\nthroughout the United States to-day a child born before the marriage\r\nof its parents is legitimate if its parents afterward marry. That is\r\ntrue, no matter how late it is; if the man marries her even on his\r\ndeath-bed, all his children are legitimized.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"And so all the earls and barons answered with one voice,\r\nthat they would not change the laws of England.\"]\r\n\r\nIn the same Statute of Merton there is a sentence against usury, \"no\r\nusury permitted against minors\"; and there are two things to note\r\nhere. One is, that the secular legislature is also taking jurisdiction\r\nof minors, who were claimed at that time to be solely under the\r\njurisdiction of the church; and the other is the reference to usury.\r\nMind you, usury is interest. It didn't mean excessive interest, as\r\nit does now. As you probably know, the notion prevailed in the early\r\nMiddle Ages that all usury--interest--was a sin and wrong; and even\r\nRuskin has chapter after chapter arguing that principle, that it is\r\nwrong to take interest for money. I should perhaps add another reason\r\nwhy interest was so disliked in early England: There was very little\r\nmoney in early England; and it mostly belonged to the Jews. It was\r\na good deal as it is in Russia to-day; the Jews were persecuted in\r\nRussia as in early England, because, in the country districts of\r\nRussia, the Jews have all the money, and money-lenders are always\r\nunpopular. So in early England. The great barons had their land and\r\ntheir cattle and crops, but they had little money. When they wanted\r\nmoney they got the value of it out of their tenants. Nobody carried\r\nlarge sums of money around with him then, any more than a woman does\r\nto-day--she relies on her husband or father; they went to the nearest\r\nJew. When the king wanted cash, he also extorted it from the Jews. One\r\nof the early Henrys said seriously, that he regarded the Jews as a\r\nvery convenient sponge! That is, they sucked all the money in the\r\nkingdom and got it into a place whence he could easily get it out. But\r\nit made the Jews very unpopular with the masses of the people and with\r\nthe Parliament; hence, their great dislike of usury. I doubt very much\r\nif they would have cared much about usury if one gentleman had been in\r\nthe habit of loaning money to another; but all the money came from the\r\nJews, who were very unpopular; and the statutes against usury were\r\nreally made against them, and that is why it was so easy to pass\r\nthem--they based it, doubtless, on the references to usury in the\r\nBible. Thus they got the notion that it was wrong to charge interest,\r\nor at least extortionate interest; more than a certain definite per\r\ncent.; and this is the origin of all our interest and usury statutes\r\nto-day. Although most economists will tell you that it is ridiculous\r\nto have any limit on the rate of interest, that the loan of money\r\nmay well be worth only four per cent. to one man and twenty-five to\r\nanother, and that the best way for everybody would be to leave it\r\nalone; nevertheless, nearly all our States have usury laws. We shall\r\ndiscuss that later; but here is the first statute on the subject, and\r\nit really arose because of the feeling against the Jews. To show how\r\nstrong that prejudice was, there was another statute passed in the\r\ninterest of liberality to protect the Jews--a statute which provided\r\nliberally that you must not take from a Jew \"more than one-half his\r\nsubstance.\" And a very early commentator tells us of a Jew who fell\r\ninto a privy on a Friday, but refused to be helped out on Saturday\r\nbecause it was his Sunday; and on Sunday he besought the Earl of\r\nGloucester to pull him out, but the Earl of Gloucester refused because\r\nit was his Sunday; so the Jew remained there until Monday morning,\r\nwhen he was found dead. There is no prejudice against Hebrews to-day\r\nanywhere in Europe stronger than existed even in England for the first\r\nthree or four centuries after the Norman Conquest; and had it not been\r\nfor the protection given them by the crown, probably they would have\r\nbeen exterminated or starved out, and in 1289 they were all banished\r\nto the number of 16,160, and their movables seized.\r\n\r\nIn 1264 citizens of towns were first represented in the Parliament (in\r\nthe Great Council, that is, for the word parliament is not yet used),\r\noriginally only composed of the great barons, who were the only\r\nland-owners. The notion of there being freemen in towns was slowly\r\nestablished, but it was fully recognized by 1264, and in that year\r\ncitizens of towns first appeared in the Council. To-day, under the\r\nvarious Reform Acts, tenants or even lodgers in towns are just as much\r\nrepresented as the land-owners; but the reform which began in 1264\r\ntook six hundred years to be thoroughly established.\r\n\r\nAnd now we find the first statutory origin of that utterly fallacious\r\nprinciple--although alive to-day--that the state, in a free country,\r\na legislature-governed country, has the right, when expedient, to fix\r\nthe _price_ of anything, wages or other commodities; fallacious, I\r\nsay, except possibly as to the charges of corporations, which are\r\ngiven special privileges by the government; the principle, which\r\nprevailed throughout the Middle Ages, of fixing the prices of all\r\nthings. In this case the price was on bread; but you find now for many\r\ncenturies an attempt to fix the price of almost everything; and of\r\nlabor, too, what wages a man should be paid. It lasted persistently\r\nfor centuries and centuries, and it was only under the influence of\r\nmodern political economy, Adam Smith and other quite modern writers,\r\nthat the principle that it was possible to fix prices of commodities\r\nwas utterly eradicated from the English mind. And you hardly got it\r\nout of England before it reappeared in the United States. It is not\r\na new-fangled principle. You find the newspapers commonly talk about\r\nfixing prices by law as if it were something utterly unheard of and\r\nutterly new. It is not so. It Is on the contrary as old as almost any\r\nlegislation we have, and you can make no argument against it on that\r\nground. It has always been the custom of our ancestors to regulate\r\nthe prices of wages by law, and the notion that it was either\r\nunconstitutional or inexpedient dates from a very few years back; yet\r\nall such attempts at legislation have utterly disappeared from any\r\nmodern statute-book. In no State of our forty-six States is any one so\r\nunintelligent, even in introducing bills in the legislature, as to-day\r\nto propose that the price of a ton of coal or a loaf of bread shall\r\nbe so much. Nor is any modern legislature so unintelligent or so\r\noppressive as to propose sumptuary laws; that is, to prescribe how\r\nexpensively a man or woman must dress; but in the mediaeval times\r\nthose were thought very important. Every class in England was then\r\nrequired by law to have exactly so many coats, to spend so much money\r\non their dress, so much on their wives' dress, and certain men could\r\nhave fine cloth and others coarse cloth; everything was graded, even\r\nto the number of buttons on clothes, and they went so far even as to\r\ntry in some early legislation to say what men should have to eat; the\r\nnumber of courses a man should have for his dinner were prescribed by\r\nlaw at one time in England, varying according to the man's rank. All\r\nsuch legislation has absolutely vanished and probably no one need know\r\nthat it existed--but that when efforts are made, as they sometimes\r\nare, by our more or less uneducated members of legislatures to\r\nintroduce bills of such a kind, it is very important for us to know\r\nthat those experiments have been tried and have failed, having proved\r\nto be either impracticable or oppressive or not for the general\r\nbenefit. This is the importance of these early laws, even when\r\nobsolete; because we never know when some agitator may not pop up\r\nwith some new proposal--something he thinks new--which he thinks, if\r\nadopted, will revolutionize society. If you can show him that his\r\nnew discovery is not only not new, but was tried, and tried in vain,\r\nduring two or three centuries in the life of our own ancestors, until\r\nan enraged public abolished it, it will destroy any effect that he is\r\nlikely to make upon the average legislature.\r\n\r\nThe first general example of an English law fixing the price of a\r\ncommodity is in 1266, the Assize of Bread and Beer. That fixed the\r\nprice of bread according to the cost of wheat, a sliding scale, in\r\nother words; when a bushel of wheat cost so much, a loaf weighing a\r\ncertain amount must cost so much, etc. But you must not confound that\r\nwith the modern law that still exists in England, and in some States\r\nand cities here, merely regulating the _size_ of a loaf. That is\r\nperfectly proper, reasonable legislation, done merely for the purpose\r\nof protecting the public and preventing fraud. In England, for\r\ninstance, there is a certain standard loaf known as a quartern loaf,\r\nand in order to prevent poor people being cheated it is prescribed\r\nby city ordinance that the quartern loaf shall weigh so much, shall\r\ncontain so many ounces of flour. We do have similar laws saying how\r\nmuch a bushel of potatoes shall weigh, how much a barrel of flour\r\nshall weigh. That isn't fixing the price; it is only fixing a uniform\r\nsize so that the public may not be cheated in its dealings, and one\r\nmust not take such a law as justifying the fixing of prices.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1266 I find the first statute in the French language,\r\nNorman French; before that they were all in Latin; and they lasted in\r\nFrench for some four or five hundred years, and then they were put in\r\nEnglish. The Statute of Marlborough, 1267, is a very important one\r\nhistorically, but it does not concern us, because it mainly had to\r\ndo with the ownership of land, the tenure of land in England, an\r\nextremely important subject, but one that is obsolete here. Then we\r\nhave something about the trial of clerks for murder. Of course the\r\nword clerk there means not what we mean by a clerk, but a person who\r\ncould read and write; and nothing more than that. It originally meant\r\npersons in holy orders, who were called clerks (clerics), but there\r\ngot to be clerks who were not in holy orders. Originally only priests\r\ncould read and write. No one else knew how, except possibly great\r\npersonages like kings, and consequently it was the same thing whether,\r\nwhen you said a clerk, you meant a person who could read and write or\r\na priest. But when there got to be people who could read and write and\r\nwho were not priests, it became an important distinction. There was\r\na privilege in England known as the \"benefit of the clergy\"; if any\r\nclerk was tried for a criminal offence, no matter what, all he had to\r\ndo was to state that he was a priest and he was at once set free. In\r\nother words, he could not be punished. That doesn't concern us; but, I\r\nsuppose, it resulted from the old notion that all priests were subject\r\nonly to Rome, and to the church courts, and not to the civil law\r\ncourts; and consequently when a priest was attempted to be tried in a\r\ncivil law court, it was a way of doing what we should call \"pleading\r\nto the jurisdiction\" of the court. Later, as time went on, in England\r\nit was greatly abused, especially when there got to be clerks who\r\nwere not priests. When it meant anybody who could read and write, and\r\nanybody who had committed a murder had only to say, \"I can read and\r\nwrite,\" and be set free, it led to an extraordinary state of things.\r\nSo, from time to time, they modified the benefit of the clergy, until\r\nultimately it was abolished entirely; first by not allowing it in high\r\noffences like murder; then by imposing certain slight punishment--they\r\nwere \"burned in the hand\"; then by applying it only to the first\r\noffence, and so on, until they got rid of it entirely; and this\r\nStatute of Marlborough is simply one of the first of that long chain\r\nof statutes which finally did away with it and prevented people from\r\ngetting rid of a criminal prosecution merely because they knew how to\r\nread and write or were priests.\r\n\r\nIn 1275 I note the first use of the word parliament. I have used it\r\nfrom the beginning, but it is important to remember that the thing\r\nwas not _called_ parliament until 1275. Before that it was called\r\nthe Great Council or the King's Council, and in Saxon times the\r\nWitenagemot.\r\n\r\nThen we come down to the Statute of Westminster I. That is considered\r\na great landmark in statutory legislation mainly because it is the\r\nfirst attempt to establish a code, or, at least, a large collection of\r\nthe laws of England. It is an attempt to put what they supposed to be\r\na good part of them into writing. We have no codes in this country,\r\nas a rule; nor to-day in England; the ordinary Anglo-Saxon does\r\nnot believe in codes. It is the French and Germans who have codes.\r\nNevertheless, you often find collections of statutes. It is important\r\nnot to confound these things with codes, because they never pretend to\r\nbe complete. Many States in this country never make revision of the\r\nstatutes. Nevertheless, every ten or twenty years they will print a\r\ncollection of the statutes arranged alphabetically. In some States, as\r\nin Massachusetts, those collections are official; but in other\r\nStates they are simply matters of private enterprise. They are of no\r\nauthority, and if they are wrong it is no protection to you. You are\r\nbound to know the laws. These early so-called codes, especially this\r\ncode of Edward I, although it caused him to be called the English\r\nJustinian, because it was the first attempt of putting any large\r\nbody of the Anglo-Saxon laws in writing at all, are still not at all\r\n_codes_ in the technical sense. This one was merely a collection of a\r\ncertain number of laws reduced to writing and re-enacted by Edward I.\r\nWe note here the phrase \"common right shall be done to rich and poor,\"\r\nrather an interesting landmark; it shows what progress was being made\r\nby the people in establishing their rights as freemen and to equal\r\nlaws. For the laws of Norman England mainly applied to land-owners,\r\nand were made by the barons, the only people that had property; there\r\nwas but a small class in those early days between the land-owners and\r\nactual serfs, villeins, who were practically attached to the soil,\r\nin a condition almost of servitude; they did service, were not paid\r\nwages, and couldn't leave the place where they were born--and both\r\nthese are tests of slavery. But in the first two centuries after the\r\nConquest the number of freemen very rapidly increased; men who were\r\nnot property owners, not land-owners, but still freemen. Especially\r\nit increased in the towns, for the towns very early established their\r\nright to be free, far earlier than the country. It was very early\r\nestablished that the citizens of any town, that is, the members of\r\nthe guild of the town, duly admitted to the guild, were freemen, and\r\nprobably before this statute. But this is interesting as a recognition\r\nof the fact that there were free poor people--people without property,\r\nwho nevertheless were neither villeins nor serfs--and that they were\r\nentitled to equality before the law, just as we are to-day, as early\r\nas 1275. Otherwise, the Statute of Westminster concerns mainly the\r\ncriminal law. There is one very important provision--because it has\r\nbeen historically followed from then down to now--that there shall\r\nbe no disturbance of the elections. Elections shall be free and\r\nunimpeded, uncontrolled by any power, either by the crown, or\r\nParliament, or any trespasser. That has been a great principle of\r\nEnglish freedom ever since, and passed into our unwritten constitution\r\nover here, and of course has been re-enacted in many of our laws. That\r\nis the feeling which lay behind those statutes which we enacted after\r\nour slaves were freed, for the making of elections free in the\r\nSouth; for protecting negroes in the act of voting and preventing\r\ninterference with them by the Ku Klux Klan. The Democratic party\r\nstrongly objected and objects still to such legislation on the part of\r\nthe government, on the ground that the right of regulating elections\r\nbelongs to the States and not to the Federal government; which,\r\nconstitutionally speaking, before the Fifteenth Amendment at least,\r\nwas true. They do not, of course, deny this great old English\r\nprinciple that elections must be free and must not be intimidated or\r\ncontrolled by anybody; but, they say, we left the machinery of the\r\nelections in the hands of the States when we adopted the Federal\r\nConstitution; and although at our State elections some of the officers\r\nelected are Federal officers--as, for instance, the President of the\r\nUnited States, or rather the presidential electors, and members of\r\nCongress--nevertheless, when we adopted the Federal Constitution, the\r\nfounders chose to rely for the machinery of a fair and free election\r\nupon the officers of States; so that the Federal government has\r\nnothing to do with it, and has no business to send Federal troops to\r\nthe South; and they called such bills the \"force\" bill. In theory, of\r\ncourse, those elections were controlled in these bills just as much in\r\nthe North as in the South; but there being practically no complaint in\r\nthe North that the negroes were not allowed to vote, as a matter of\r\nfact the strength of the Federal government was only invoked in the\r\nSouthern States.\r\n\r\n\"Fines are to be reasonable.\" You find that principle in all our\r\nconstitutions to-day in the clause that there shall be no cruel or\r\nunusual punishments, and that fines shall be proportionate to the\r\noffence; this principle is expressed also in Magna Charta.\r\n\r\nThen slander and rape were made criminal at common law; before this\r\nonly the church took jurisdiction. Slander Is the imputing of crime to\r\na person by speech, by word of mouth. If it be a written imputation,\r\nit is libel and not slander. Then in this statute also we find the\r\nfirst import tax upon wool. The constitutionality of revenue taxes,\r\nduties, or taxes on imports, was once disputed by our parties; one\r\nparty denying the constitutional right to impose any tax upon imports\r\nexcept for the strict purpose of raising necessary revenue; the\r\nargument being perfectly logical and based upon the constitutional\r\nprinciple we already have had that all taxation must be for the common\r\nbenefit. Democrats argued that if a tax upon imports was imposed to\r\nraise the necessary revenue, that is for the common benefit; but if it\r\nwas imposed, as it avowedly is imposed in Republican legislation, for\r\nthe purpose of benefiting certain industries or classes, why that,\r\nof course, is not for the common or general benefit and therefore\r\nunconstitutional. The trouble with this position is that early English\r\nlaws were prohibitive of imports--that is, they were imposed for\r\nprohibition _before_ they allowed importation on payment of duties.\r\nThis Statute of Westminster is a landmark, as showing how slow the\r\nCommons were in even allowing taxation upon imports at all. They\r\nearlier allowed the ordinary direct taxes. All that the Norman kings\r\ngot they got with the consent of Parliament, direct taxes, for the\r\ncommon benefit; but they struggled for two centuries before they got\r\nthe permission of Parliament to impose duties, taxes upon imports;\r\nhere first they finally got it on wool, the thing produced of most\r\nvalue of anything in England; and consequently an important protective\r\nduty. It is a curious historical fact that this article, wool, seems\r\nto be the chief bone of contention ever since; in our tariffs nothing\r\nhas been more bitter than the dispute on wool; the duty on wool is the\r\nshibboleth of the extreme protectionist.[1] Ohio, which is the home\r\nof the strong protection feeling, regards the duty on wool as the\r\ncorner-stone to the whole fabric. It is argued that \"a cheap coat\r\nmakes a cheap man.\" In the East the feeling is that the duty on wool\r\nmakes clothing poor and shoddy, and the prices excessively high for\r\nthe poor. It is odd to find that the very first thing that did make\r\ntrouble was the duty on wool, and it is still making the same trouble\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The \"ancient\" customs were on wool, woolfels and leather;\r\nall other were \"evil\" customs. Holt, afterward C.J., in \"The Great\r\nCase of Monopolies.\"]\r\n\r\nThere is another interesting clause in this statute; I don't know\r\nwhether in this country so much as there, but it is in England the\r\nalmost universal custom of ships to have a dog or cat on board. You\r\nnever will find a coasting vessel without a dog or cat, usually both;\r\nand I believe it is for this strange historical reason, as shown in\r\nthis Statute of Westminster I: In those days all wrecks belonged to\r\nthe king. (Pretty much everything, in fact, did belong to the king,\r\nexcept the land that was held by book or charter, or such personal\r\nproperty as a man had in his own house--all mines, all franchises, all\r\nmonopolies, even all whales and sturgeons that were thrown up on the\r\nbeach--the head to the king and the tail to the queen.) So all wrecks\r\nbelonged to the king. The result was, that whenever any vessel went\r\nashore the king's officers seized it; and naturally the owner of the\r\nvessel didn't like that, because it very often happened that the\r\nvessel was perfectly good and could be easily repaired and the cargo\r\nsaved. It is still a great principle in marine law that if one-half of\r\nthe cargo is good, the man who owns the vessel cannot surrender and\r\nclaim from the insurance company as a total loss; it is important\r\nstill how much of a wreck a wreck is. But in those days the king, even\r\nif the vessel was stranded and could be raised, would seize it on\r\nthe plea it was a wreck. The man who owned the ship would say she is\r\nperfectly seaworthy; and then would come the dispute as to what a\r\nwreck was. Or even when the vessel was destroyed, a great part of the\r\ncargo might be saved, and the owner of the vessel thought it very\r\nunjust that the king should claim it all. So the Parliament of England\r\nestablished as part of the liberties of the English merchant or trader\r\nthat he should still have a property in his wreck; and then the\r\nquestion came up as to what was a wreck. It was generally admitted\r\nthat when all hands were lost, that was a wreck; but they wanted to\r\nget as narrow a definition as they could, so they got Parliament to\r\nestablish this law, that in future nothing shall be considered a wreck\r\nout of which a cat or a dog escapes alive; and from that time until\r\nthe present day no vessel coasts about England without carrying a cat\r\nor dog.\r\n\r\nBut the great achievements of legislation up to 1300 remain the\r\nre-establishment of English law, as shown in the great charters of\r\nJohn, Henry III, and the confirmation of Edward I. And Magna Charta\r\nhad to be read once a year (like our Declaration of Independence),\r\nand for breach of it a king might be excommunicated; and Henry III\r\nhimself, according to Cobbet, feared that the Archbishop of Canterbury\r\nwas about to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEARLY LABOR LEGISLATION, AND LAWS AGAINST TRUSTS\r\n\r\n\r\n(1275) Far the most important phrase to us found in the Statute of\r\nWestminster I, save perhaps that common right should be done to rich\r\nand poor, is to be found in this sentence: \"Excessive toll, contrary\r\nto the common custom of the realm,\" is forbidden. The statute applies\r\nonly to market towns, but the principle established there would\r\nnaturally go elsewhere, and indeed most towns where there was any\r\ntrade were, in those days, market towns. Every word is noticeable:\r\n\"Excessive toll\"--extortion in rates. As this statute passed into the\r\ncommon law of England and hence our own, it has probably always been\r\nlaw in America except, possibly, in those few States which expressly\r\nrepealed the whole common law[1] and those where civil law\r\nprevailed.[2] It was therefore equally unnecessary to adopt new\r\nstatutes providing against extortion or discrimination, for the last\r\npart of the phrase \"contrary to the common custom of the realm\" means\r\ndiscrimination. But this is one of the numerous cases where our\r\nlegislatures, if not our bar and bench, erred through simple\r\nhistorical ignorance. They had forgotten this law, or, more\r\ncharitably, they may have thought it necessary to remind the people of\r\nit. There has been a recent agitation in this country with the object\r\nof compelling great public-service companies, such as electric\r\nlighting or gas companies, to make the same rates to consumers, large\r\nor small. This also was very possibly the common law, and required no\r\nnew statutes; there are cases reported as far back as the fourteenth\r\nand fifteenth centuries where, for instance, a ferryman was punished\r\nfor charging less for the ferriage of a large drove of sheep or cattle\r\nthan for a smaller number, \"contrary to the common custom of the\r\nrealm.\" Nine years before this statute is the Assize of Bread and\r\nBeer, attempting to fix the price of bread according to the cost\r\nof wheat, but notable to us as containing both the first pure-food\r\nstatute and the first statute against \"forestalling.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Florida, Texas, and the old Territory of Dakota.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Louisiana, New Mexico, and Arizona.]\r\n\r\nNow forestalling, regrating, and engrossing are the early English\r\nphrases for most of the unlawful or unmoral actions which we ascribe\r\nto the modern trust. In fact, there is hardly one legal injury which\r\na trust is said to commit in these days which cannot be ranked under\r\nthose three heads, or that of monopoly or that of restraint of trade.\r\n\r\n\"Forestalling\" is the buying up provisions on the way to a market with\r\nintent to sell at a higher price; and the doctrine applied primarily\r\nto provisions, that is to say, necessaries of life. Precisely the same\r\nthing exists to-day, only we term it the buying of futures, or the\r\nattempt to create a corner. We shall find that the buying of futures,\r\nthat is to say, of crops not yet grown or outputs not yet created,\r\nis still obnoxious to many of our legislatures to-day, and has been\r\nforbidden, or made criminal, in many States. \"Regrating\" is defined\r\nin some of the early dictionaries as speculating in provisions; the\r\noffence of buying provisions at a market for the purpose of reselling\r\nthem within four miles of the place. The careful regulation of markets\r\nand market towns that existed in early times in England would not\r\nsuffer some rich capitalist to go in and buy all that was offered for\r\nsale with intent of selling it to the same neighborhood at a higher\r\nprice. Bishop Hatto of the Rhine, you may remember, paid with his life\r\nfor this offence. The prejudice against this sort of thing has by no\r\nmeans ended to-day. We have legislation against speculation in theatre\r\ntickets, as well as in cotton or grain. \"Engrossing\" is really the\r\nresult of a successful forestalling, with or without regrating; that\r\nis to say, it is a complete \"corner of the market\"; from it our word\r\n\"grocer\" is derived. Such corners, if completely successful, would\r\nhave the public at their mercy; luckily they rarely are; the\r\ndifficulty, in fact, begins when you begin to regrate. But in\r\nartificial commodities it is easier; so in the Northern Pacific\r\ncorner, a nearly perfect engrossing; the shares of stock went to a\r\nthousand dollars, and might have gone higher but for the voluntary\r\ninterference of great financiers. Leiter's Chicago corner in wheat,\r\nSully's corner in cotton, were almost perfect examples of engrossing,\r\nbut failed when the regrating began. All these tend to monopoly, and\r\nact, of course, in restraint of trade; the broader meanings of these\r\ntwo latter more important principles we leave for later discussion.\r\n\r\n(1285) The Statute of Bakers, or Assize of Bread and Ale, is by some\r\nassigned to the 13th of Edward I. If so, we find all these great\r\nmodern questions treated by statute in the reign of the same\r\ngreat law-making king, Edward I, who well was called the \"English\r\nJustinian\"; for, in 1305, twenty years later, we have the first\r\nStatute of Conspiracy. This statute only applies to the maintaining\r\nof lawsuits; but the Statute of Laborers of 1360 declares void _all_\r\nalliances and covins between masons, carpenters, and guilds, chapters\r\nand ordinances; and from this time on the statutes recognize the\r\nEnglish common law of conspiracy in general words.\r\n\r\nAs this is one of the most important doctrines of the English law, and\r\nmoreover one which is most criticised to-day by large interests, both\r\nof capital and labor, it will be wise to dwell upon its historical and\r\nlogical origin in this place, though we shall consider it at length\r\nlater as it touches various fields of legislation. It is notable for\r\ntwo most important principles: first, that it recognizes the great\r\nmenace of combined action, and both forbids and punishes combinations\r\nto do an act which might be lawful for the individual; second, of all\r\nbranches of civil, as distinct from criminal, law, it is the one which\r\nmost largely recognizes intent; that is to say, the ethical purposes\r\nof the combination. It has been urged in some judicial opinions that\r\nin matters of boycotts, strikes, etc., the law cannot go into the\r\nmotive; this argument obviously proves too much, for it is no more\r\neasy to examine motives in the criminal law, and this is done all\r\nthe time. A homicide, for instance, will vary in all degrees between\r\njustifiable guilt or manslaughter up to murder in the first degree,\r\naccording to the motive which prompted the act. It is really no more\r\ndifficult, and the reported cases do not show it to be any more\r\ndifficult, to consider the motive behind a combination of men or the\r\nmotive inspiring a series of related acts. The real trouble comes only\r\nin the Federal anti-trust act, because the machinery of this clumsy\r\nstatute, a bill in equity, imposes upon judges the duty of finding the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of conspiracy is so old in England that I am unable to\r\ntrace it to its source. From the wording of repeated early statutes\r\nit would seem that they recognized this law of conspiracy as already\r\nexisting and merely applied it to new forms, such as, for instance,\r\nthe combination of masons, carpenters, and guilds, just mentioned. It\r\nis, perhaps, not to us important whether it is originally based on\r\ncommon law or these early statutes, for these statutes are quite early\r\nenough to have passed into the common law of England, and consequently\r\ninto the common law in this country. Moreover, early statutes merely\r\nexpress the common law; therein lies their significance. Now, many\r\nState laws and constitutions, as well as most State courts, recognize\r\nthat the common-law statutes of England existing at least before 1775,\r\nif not 1620,[1] are common law in the States of this Union. In a\r\ngeneral way, any statute that antedates the time of our settlement we\r\ntook over as part of our common law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: 1607 (Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Indiana,\r\nMissouri, Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming); 1776 (Florida, Maryland, Rhode\r\nIsland, Pennsylvania). None, however, are law in New York.]\r\n\r\nWe are now coming also to that great range of statutes, which, on the\r\none hand, control labor and regulate the rights of the laborer, both\r\nin his prices and in his hours; and, on the other, those statutes\r\nrelating to what we call \"trusts,\" conspiracy, and trades-unions,\r\nwhich have made common-law principles which are to-day, all of them,\r\ninvoked by our courts; and form the precedents of practically all\r\nour modern legislation on matters affecting labor, labor disputes,\r\ninjunctions, strikes, boycotts, blacklists, restraint of trade, and\r\ntrusts--in fact, the largest field of discussion now before the mind\r\nof the American people. The subjects are more or less connected. That\r\nis, you have the growth of legislation as to laborers on the one\r\nhand, and on the other you have the growth of this legislation as to\r\ncombinations or conspiracies, trades-unions, guilds, etc.\r\n\r\n(1304) Now let us begin at that first statute of conspiracy, and find\r\nwhat the definition of a conspiracy is; because it is a very important\r\nquestion to-day, whether we are going to stick to the old common-law\r\nidea or not. The very title of this statute is \"A definition of\r\nconspirators,\" and it begins: \"Conspirators be they that do confeder\r\nor bind themselves together by oath, covenant or other alliance\"\r\neither to indict or maintain lawsuits; \"and such as retain men in\r\nthe Countrie with Liveries or Fees for to maintain their malicious\r\nEnterprises, and this extends as well to the Takers as to the Givers.\"\r\nAnd as it gradually assumed shape and got definite and broad, the\r\nidea, we will say, by 1765, when Blackstone wrote, was this: _A\r\nconspiracy is a combination by two or more men, persons or companies,\r\nto bring about, either an unlawful result by means lawful or unlawful,\r\nor a lawful result by unlawful means._ Now so far the definition is\r\nadmitted. Everybody agrees, both the labor leaders and the courts,\r\non that definition--that when two or more people combine together\r\nto effect an _unlawful_ object, it is a conspiracy; which is both a\r\ncriminal offence under the laws of the land everywhere, and also gives\r\nthe party injured a right to damages, that is, what we call a civil\r\nsuit; and furthermore no _act_ is necessary. There is no doubt about\r\nthat part of the definition. Or where they combine to get a lawful\r\nend by unlawful means, as, for instance, when laborers combine to get\r\ntheir employer to raise their wages by the process of knocking on the\r\nhead all men that come to take their places, that is gaining a lawful\r\nend by unlawful means, by intimidation--and is a conspiracy. But now\r\nthe whole doctrine in discussion comes in: If you have a combination\r\nto bring about by _lawful_ means the _injury_ of a third person in his\r\nlawful rights--not amounting to crime--is that an unlawful conspiracy?\r\nYes--for it is a \"malicious enterprise.\" So is our law, and the common\r\nlaw of England, yes. And you can easily see the common-sense of it.\r\nThe danger to any individual is so tremendous if he is to be conspired\r\nagainst by thousands, hundreds of thousands, not by one neighbor, but\r\nby all the people of the town, that it early got established as a\r\nprinciple of the common law, and of these early English statutes,\r\nthat, although one man alone might do an act which, otherwise lawful,\r\nwas to the injury of a third person, and be neither restrained nor\r\npunished for it, he could not _combine with others_ for that purpose\r\nby the very same acts. For instance, I don't like the butcher with\r\nwhom I have been doing business; I take away my trade. That, of\r\ncourse, I have a perfect right to do. But going a step farther, I\r\ntell my friends I don't like Smith and don't want to trade with\r\nhim--probably I have a right to do that; but when I get every citizen\r\nof that town together at a meeting and say: \"Let us all agree to\r\nruin Smith, we will none of us trade with him\"--Smith is bound to\r\nbe ruined. The common law early recognized this importance of the\r\nprinciple of combination, and therefore it was part of the English\r\ncommon law and is still, barring one recent statute, that a\r\ncombination to injure a person, although by an act which if done\r\nby one individual would be lawful, is nevertheless an unlawful\r\ncombination; that is, a _conspiracy_ under the law; for all\r\n\"conspiracies\" are unlawful, under the law; the meaning of the word\r\n_conspiracy_ in the law is, not an innocent combination, but a guilty\r\none, and anything which is a _conspiracy_ at law can be punished\r\ncriminally, or will give rise to civil suits for damages by the\r\nparties injured, or usually entitle one to the protection of an\r\ninjunction. A conspiracy, therefore, is not only a guilty combination,\r\nof two or more persons, for an unlawful end by any means, or for a\r\nlawful end by unlawful means, but also one for an immoral end, a\r\nmalicious end, as, let us say, the ruin of a third person, or the\r\ninjury of the public. All the dispute about the law of conspiracy and\r\nthe statutes and what laborers can do and what employers can do to-day\r\nreally hinges about that last clause. The labor leaders, the radicals,\r\nwant to say that nothing shall be a conspiracy where the end is\r\nnot unlawful and where the acts done are such as, if done by an\r\nindividual, would not be wrong. In other words, they want statutes\r\nto provide that nothing is a conspiracy where the acts done are\r\nin themselves lawful if done by one individual. But this English\r\nconspiracy law was of the most immense sociological value, in that it\r\ndid recognize the tremendous power of _combination_. It said, although\r\nyou don't have to trade with Smith alone, yet a combination of a\r\ngreat many individuals for the purpose of ruining Smith, by all\r\nsimultaneously refusing to trade with him, is such a tremendous injury\r\nto Smith that the law will take cognizance of it and hold that kind of\r\na combination to be unlawful.\r\n\r\nThis definition should be further extended, perhaps, to remind you\r\nthat the courts hold that there are certain kinds of combinations,\r\ncontemplating ends which will necessarily result in the use of\r\nunlawful means; the most familiar example is picketing. The courts\r\nmostly hold that although in theory a labor union can march up and\r\ndown the highway and peacefully advise non-union men or other laborers\r\nnot to take their jobs, in practice such action usually, if not\r\nnecessarily, goes to the point of intimidation; and intimidation is\r\nnearly always made unlawful by statute. Now I should only add that\r\nit is very important to remember--and even the courts do not always\r\nremember it--that the thing being punished as a conspiracy is not the\r\nend, but the combining; the conspiracy itself is the criminal act.\r\nSuppose in Pennsylvania one thousand men meet and say: \"John Smith\r\nhas taken a job and is a scab, and we will go around and maul him\r\nto-night,\" and they do, or they don't; if they are tried, the fact\r\nwhether they did maul him or not has nothing to do with the matter\r\nof the conspiracy. They might, of course, be tried for assault and\r\nbattery, or for an attempt to commit murder; but if they are being\r\ntried for the _conspiracy_ the criminal act is the combining and\r\nmeeting, not what they do afterward. Therefore it is of no importance\r\nwhatever what the result of the matter is. The thing that is criminal\r\nis the combining; and this leads to a very curious consequence:\r\nAll conspiracies are criminal; but the object aimed at may be very\r\nslightly so. So that it is perfectly possible to have a conspiracy\r\nwhich shall result to its members in five or ten years in the\r\nstate-prison, whereas the object itself, the act aimed at, may have\r\nbeen comparatively slight, a mere misdemeanor. Take the case of mere\r\nintimidation without assault or battery; one man goes to another\r\nand says: \"If you take that work I shall smash your head,\" that is\r\nintimidation. Thirty of our States have made that unlawful, but it is\r\nonly a misdemeanor. But if one thousand men get together and say:\r\n\"We will go around to tell him we will smash his head,\" that is\r\nconspiracy; and conspiracy may subject them to penalty of years in\r\nprison. It has been found in the experience of the English people to\r\nbe such a dangerous power, this power of combination, that to use it\r\nfor an unlawful or wrongful end may be more of an offence than the end\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nA combination to injure a man's trade is, therefore, an unlawful\r\nconspiracy; well shown in a recent Ohio case where a combination of\r\nseveral persons to draw their money out of a bank simultaneously for\r\nthe purpose of making it fail, was held criminal. It gives a claim\r\nfor damages in a civil suit and may be enjoined against. But is it\r\nnecessarily criminal? It is possible that the offence to the public is\r\nso slight that the criminal courts would hardly take cognizance of it\r\nin minor cases where there is not some statute expressly providing for\r\na criminal remedy. The Sherman Act, our Anti-trust Act, does so where\r\neven two persons conspire together to restrain interstate commerce. It\r\nis a crime at common law, however slight, for even two to combine to\r\ninjure any person's trade. But, independent of statutes, suppose only\r\ntwo persons agree not to buy of a certain butcher in Cambridge: in\r\ntheory, he might have a civil remedy; but it may be doubted that it\r\nwould amount to a criminal offence. _Lex non curat de minimis_. So,\r\nit is an offence under most State anti-trust laws, as it was at the\r\ncommon law, to fix the price of an article--that is restraint of\r\ntrade--or to limit the output. Two grocers going to the city in the\r\nmorning train agree that they will charge seven dollars a barrel for\r\nflour during the ensuing week; two icemen, to harvest only a thousand\r\ntons of ice. The contract between them could not be enforced; it is\r\nundoubtedly unlawful; but it would hardly be a criminal offence at the\r\ncommon law. There is, at least at the common law, some middle ground\r\nbetween those contracts which are merely unenforceable, and those\r\nwhich subject the co-makers to a criminal liability; although under\r\nthe cast-iron wording of a statute it may be that no such distinction\r\ncan be made.\r\n\r\nIndependent of combination, there is probably no legal wrong in merely\r\nwishing ill to a man, withdrawing one's custom from him, competing\r\nwith him, or even, possibly, in injuring his trade. There is an\r\nancient case where the captain of an English ship engaged in a certain\r\ntrade, to wit, the slave trade, arrived off a beach on the coast\r\nof Africa and was collecting his living cargo, when a second ship,\r\narriving too late to get a load itself, fired a cannon over the heads\r\nof the negroes, and they, with the chief who was selling them, fled\r\nin terror to the forest. The captain of the first ship went back to\r\nLondon and brought suit against the captain of the second ship for\r\ninjuring his trade and was allowed to recover damages; but it may\r\nbe doubted if that is good law; although in 1909 a Minnesota court\r\ndecided that a barber could sue an enemy if he maintained an\r\nopposition barbershop solely for the purpose of injuring his business;\r\nand a few years ago in Louisiana a street railway foreman was held\r\nliable in damages for instructing his men not to frequent the\r\nplaintiff's store.[1] I say to you: \"Do not trade with Smith, he is\r\nnot a good person to deal with,\" or, \"Do not take employment with\r\nhim, he will treat you cruelly\"; and in either case, unless I can\r\nbe convicted of slander, he has no remedy against me if I am acting\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Tarleton _v_. McGawley, Peak, N.P.C. 270; Tuttle _v_.\r\nBuck, 110 N.W. 946; Graham _v_. St. Charles St. Ry. Co., 47 La. Ann.\r\n214.]\r\n\r\nNow, this great law of conspiracy applies equally and always to\r\ncombinations of capital or of employers, to trusts, contracts in\r\nrestraint of trade and blacklists, as well as to unlawful labor\r\ncombinations, unlawful union rules, and boycotts. The statutes\r\ndirected against both originated about the same time and have run\r\nhistorically on all-fours together. The old offences of forestalling\r\nand regrating may have been lost sight of, and possibly the statutes\r\nagainst them fallen into disuse, although they were expressly made\r\nperpetual by the 13th Elizabeth in 1570 and not repealed until the\r\n12th George III in 1772; but the principle invalidating restraint of\r\ntrade and contracts in restraint of trade remained as alive as that\r\nprohibiting unlawful combinations of labor. The latter, indeed, has\r\nlargely disappeared. Both strikes and trades-unions, once thought\r\nunlawful in England, are made lawful now by statute, but a contract\r\nin restraint of trade or a monopolistic combination of capital is as\r\nunlawful as it ever was both in England and in this country; and the\r\ncommon law is only re-enforced by our State statutes and applied to\r\nmatters of interstate commerce as well, by the Sherman Act. Closely\r\nconnected with both is the principle of reasonable rates in the\r\nexercise of franchises; excessive toll contrary to common custom, as\r\nwe found forbidden in 1275. The first statute against forestalling\r\nmerely inflicts a punishment on forestallers and dates ten years\r\nlater, 1285, though the time of this, the Statute concerning Bakers,\r\nis put by some still earlier, with the Assize of Bread and Beer, in\r\n1266. It provides the standard weight and price of bread, ale, and\r\nwine, the toll of a mill. It anticipates our pure-food laws and\r\npunishes butchers for selling unwholesome flesh or adulterating\r\noatmeal, and says \"that no Forestaller be suffered to dwell in\r\nany Town, which is an open Oppressor of Poor People ... which for\r\nGreediness of his private Gain doth prevent others in buying Grain,\r\nFish, Herring, or any other Thing to be sold coming by land or Water,\r\noppressing the Poor, and deceiving the Rich, which carrieth away such\r\nThings, intending to sell them more dear,... and an whole Town or a\r\nCountry is deceived by such Craft and Subtilty,\" and the punishment is\r\nput at a fine at the first offence with the loss of the thing bought,\r\nthe pillory for the second offence, fine and imprisonment for the\r\nthird, and the fourth time banishment from the town.\r\n\r\nThe first definition of forestalling is here given. Our modern\r\nequivalent is the buying of futures or dealing in stocks without\r\nintent to deliver, both of which have been forbidden or made criminal\r\nin many of our States. And forestalling, regrating, and engrossing\r\nwere things early recognized as criminal in England, and these\r\nstatutes embody much of what is sound in the present legislation\r\nagainst trusts.\r\n\r\nForestalling was very apt to be done in a _staple_, that is, in the\r\ntown which was specially devoted to that article of trade; so that\r\nthe laws of forestalling got very much mixed up with the laws of the\r\nstaple; but forestalling would equally mean going into any market and\r\nbuying up all the production. If the article was produced abroad, the\r\nforestaller would try to buy up the entire importation.\r\n\r\n(1352) We now find another statute; it applies to wines and liquors\r\n\"and all other wares that come to the good towns of England,\" and the\r\npenalty imposed by that law was that the forestaller must forfeit the\r\nsurplus over cost to the crown and be imprisoned two years. We are\r\nstill enforcing remedies of that kind in our anti-trust laws, only\r\ninstead of having him forfeit the surplus to the crown we usually have\r\nhim pay damages, sometimes treble damages to the persons injured. In\r\nthe Beef Trust case, the parties were duly convicted, and instead of\r\nbeing imprisoned, they were fined $25,000. In other words, we still\r\nhave not the courage to go to the length that our ancestors did in\r\nenforcing the penalties of these unlawful combinations. Of course it\r\nis a much more difficult thing to have forestalling and engrossing\r\nlaws against foreign importations than against home productions; and\r\nso to-day we have not tried, except by a tariff, forestalling laws\r\nagainst foreign importations, but we have attempted to apply them very\r\nmuch as to home productions. In England, however, the statute at that\r\ntime said that a person who bought up all the foreign product must\r\nforfeit all the profits to the state. Now this is nothing but the\r\n\"Iowa idea\" of two years ago. It was suggested very urgently by\r\nGovernor Cummins that there should be a law providing that where a\r\ntrust got complete control of a certain industry in this country its\r\nsurplus profit should be forfeited either indirectly by the taking\r\noff of the tariff, or by way of a franchise tax, that is, of a United\r\nStates tax upon its franchises, which could be increased in such a way\r\nas to tax it out of existence if it persisted. The latter remedy is at\r\nthe root of President Taft's new corporation tax, but Congress has not\r\nyet applied the former, although it was very seriously advocated that\r\nthere should be statutes which should indirectly forfeit the profits\r\nof the trust that had secured a monopoly; that is an engrossing\r\ntrust--covin or alliance, as our ancestors would have called it--\"a\r\ngentleman's agreement\"--and that it should be done by a reduction of\r\nthe tariff on the articles in which that trust dealt; this reduction\r\nto be ordered by the president. When he determined that a trust had\r\ncompletely engrossed an industry, he might say so by proclamation; and\r\nthen the act of Congress should go into effect and the duties upon\r\nthat product be abolished, all the protection of the trust taken away.\r\nThere is a trouble with such legislation, in that it may be said to\r\nallow the president to make the law; and under our Constitution the\r\npresident cannot make laws. The legislative branch and the executive\r\nbranch of the government must be kept distinct; and it probably would\r\nbe argued by constitutional lawyers, and in this instance by either\r\nparty that was not in favor of such legislation, that to reduce the\r\nduties of such a class of goods was a legislative act, and therefore\r\nany such law would be unconstitutional because the president cannot\r\nlegislate. But the point I wish to make now in both these cases is the\r\nexact correspondence of the problem; what are remedies to-day were\r\nremedies five hundred years ago. So far we have found nothing new,\r\neither in remedy or offence.\r\n\r\n(1349) Now there is a third great line of legislation that we must\r\nconsider in connection with these other two, and that is the Statutes\r\nof Labor. It was the custom in early times to attempt to regulate\r\nprices; both of wages and commodities. The first Statute of Laborers\r\ndates from 1349. Its history was economic. They had had a great plague\r\nin England known as the Black Death; and it had carried off a vast\r\nnumber of people, especially the laboring people. There was naturally\r\ngreat demand for workers. Laborers were very scarce. It is estimated\r\nthat one-third of the entire population had died; and there has never\r\nbeen a time when wages were so high relatively, that is, when wages\r\nwould buy so much for the workingman, as about the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century. But the employers were no fonder of high wages\r\nthan they are to-day. All England was used to sumptuary laws, laws\r\nregulating the price of commodities, and villeins still existed. They\r\nwere only just beginning to consider agricultural laborers as freemen;\r\nthey were used to the notion of exerting a control over laboring men,\r\nwho were still often appendant to the land on which they worked, for\r\nit was unlawful for an agricultural laborer to change his abode; and\r\nin many other ways they were under strict laws. So that it didn't\r\nseem much of a step to say also, we will regulate the rate of\r\nwages--particularly as the payment of wages in money was rather a new\r\nthing. Probably two or three centuries before most wages were paid in\r\narticles of food or in the use of the land. So they got this first\r\nStatute of Laborers through; it required all persons able in body\r\nunder sixty to do labor to such persons as require labor or else be\r\ncommitted to gaol. That, of course, is compulsory labor; the law would\r\ntherefore be unconstitutional with us to-day except in so far as it\r\napplied, under a criminal statute, in regard to tramps or vagrants. In\r\nsome States we commit tramps and vagrants to gaol if they won't do a\r\ncertain amount of work for their lodging, under the theory that they\r\nhave committed a criminal act in being vagrants. Otherwise this\r\nprinciple, a law requiring all persons to work, is now obsolete. Then\r\nit went on to say, no workman or servant can depart from service\r\nbefore the time agreed upon; lawful enough, to-day, although laborers\r\ndo not like to make a definite contract. The South, however, has\r\nadopted this principle as to agricultural labor, just as in the\r\nEngland of the fourteenth century. Southern States have an elaborate\r\nsystem of legislation for the purpose of enforcing labor upon idle\r\nnegroes, which, when it creates a system of \"peonage,\" is forbidden by\r\nthe Federal laws and Constitution. They are compelled, as in the old\r\nEnglish statute, to serve under contract or for a period of time, and\r\nif they break it, are made liable by this statute to some fine or\r\npenalty imposed by the nearest justice of the peace; and when they\r\ncannot pay this, they may be Imprisoned. Finally, this Statute of\r\nLaborers first states the principle that the old \"wage and no more\"\r\nshall be given, thus establishing the notion that there was a legal\r\nwage, which lasted in England for centuries and gave rise to the later\r\nlaw under which strikes were held unlawful. Here, they meant such\r\nwages as prevailed before the Black Death.\r\n\r\n(1350) The next year the statute is made more elaborate, and\r\nspecifies, for common laborers, one penny a day; for mowers,\r\ncarpenters, masons, tilers, and thatchers, three pence, and so on. It\r\nis curious that the relative scale is much the same as to-day: masons\r\na little more than tilers, tilers a little more than carpenters;\r\nthough unskilled labor was paid less in proportion. The same statute\r\nattempts to protect the laborer by providing that victuals shall be\r\nsold only at reasonable prices, which were apparently fixed by the\r\nmayor.\r\n\r\nHere, therefore, we have the much-discussed Standard Wage fixed by\r\nlaw, but in the interest of the employer; not a \"living wage\" fixed\r\nin the interest of the employee, as modern thought requires. The same\r\nstatute makes it unlawful to give to able-bodied beggars, which is of\r\na piece with the compulsory labor of the able-bodied. Now this first\r\nStatute of Laborers, which led to centuries of English law unjust to\r\nthe laborers, it is interesting to note, was possibly never a valid\r\nlaw, for it was never agreed to by the House of Commons. However that\r\nmay be, the confirming statute of 1364 was duly enacted by Parliament,\r\nand this was not in terms repealed until the year 1869, although labor\r\nleaders claim it to have been repealed by general words in the 5th\r\nElizabeth.\r\n\r\nThorold Rogers tells us that those, after all, were the happy days of\r\nthe laborer--when masons got four pence a day, and the Black Prince,\r\nthe head of the army, only got twenty shillings--sixty times as much.\r\nThis is a fair modern proportion, however, for military and other\r\nstate service; though we pay the president a salary of nearly double\r\nthat proportion to the yearly pay of a carpenter. But then, these\r\nEnglish statutes applied mainly to agricultural labor; and domestic\r\nlabor was paid considerably less.\r\n\r\nThis Statute of Laborers was again re-enacted in 1360, with a clause\r\nallowing work in gross, and forbidding \"alliances and covins between\r\nmasons, carpenters, and guilds.\" Work \"in gross\" means work by\r\ncontract, piece-work, thus made expressly lawful by statute in England\r\nin 1360, but still objected to by many of our labor unions to-day.\r\nThe provision against alliances and covins was extended to cover\r\ntrades-unions, their rules and by-laws, as well as strikes, which were\r\nalso considered combinations in restraint of trade. Now this was never\r\nlaw in this country.\r\n\r\nThere was a very early case in Pennsylvania, while it was still a\r\ncolony, and there were others in the States soon after, which held\r\nthat the Statutes of Laborers were never law in America. Our statutes\r\nearly authorized trades-unions, but without this there is, I think, no\r\nAmerican case where either a trades-union or a simple strike was held\r\nto be an unlawful combination. It was these early statutes which gave\r\nrise to the law that existed until the nineteenth century in England,\r\nthat both strikes and unions were unlawful; a strike because it was\r\nusually a combination to raise the rate of wages, which was in theory\r\nfixed by law. Therefore, a strike was a combination with an unlawful\r\naim, consequently a conspiracy. The logic is simple; and in the same\r\nway a trades-union was certainly an alliance between skilled workmen,\r\nand as such forbidden under the Statute of Laborers, besides being a\r\ncombination in restraint of trade.\r\n\r\nNow the guild, in so far as it was a combination of a trade in a town,\r\nwas a perfectly lawful thing; in so far as it bore upon the right of a\r\nman to be a freeman, it was a perfectly lawful thing; it was only from\r\nthe other end, from this statute I read as to combinations, that two\r\nor three centuries later they got the notion that a trades-union was\r\nan unlawful thing; so you may say that a trades-union in England has\r\na lawful root and an unlawful root, and it is rather important to see\r\nfrom which each class springs. The first case in which the modern\r\nstrike was considered was a case known as the Journeymen Tailors'\r\ncase, which happened more than two hundred years ago; and in that case\r\nit was definitely held to be an unlawful combination, while the first\r\ncase on the modern boycott, where an injunction was awarded, is as\r\nlate as 1868, this being the origin of that process which has evoked\r\nso much criticism here, the use of the injunction in labor disputes.\r\nThe unskilled laborers in England have never combined; the only people\r\nwho combined were the guilds, the skilled men, and in so far as they\r\ncombined they did it rather as capitalists, employees, or as freemen,\r\nto govern the town; this was a lawful object; and the guilds rapidly\r\ngrew into little aristocracies. They very soon ceased to be journeyman\r\nlaborers, and became combinations of employers. Thus, the guild\r\nmovement didn't amount to much in bringing about the modern\r\ntrades-union or combinations of laboring men; it began before it\r\noccurred to these latter that they also could combine; just as,\r\neven now, it is more difficult among _women_ to get them to join\r\ntrades-unions, or for working women to combine; they have not\r\napparently got into that stage of evolution; and so with the negroes\r\nin the South. But about the end of the eighteenth century you begin to\r\nfind the first strikes and combinations of workingmen; and then what\r\nthe courts promptly applied to them was not the old line of statutes,\r\nthe historical common-law growth, deriving from a guild which in its\r\norigin was a lawful body and so making the union free and lawful, but\r\nnaturally--for the magistrates were capitalists and land-owners, and\r\nall the courts were in sympathy with that class--they went back to the\r\nlong series of Statutes of Laborers, and said \"this is a combination\r\nof workingmen to break the law by getting more than lawful wages,\"\r\nand consequently found both combinations unlawful, trades-unions and\r\nstrikes, as well as when they were combinations to injure somebody,\r\nwhat we should now call a boycott.\r\n\r\nThe great Statute of Laborers which was for centuries supposed to\r\nsettle the law of England is that of Elizabeth in 1562. Meantime,\r\nagricultural labor as well as industrial was getting to be free. A\r\nstatute of 1377, which requires villeins refusing to labor to be\r\ncommitted to prison on complaint of the landlord, without bail, itself\r\nrecognizes that villeins fleeing to a town are made free after a year\r\nand day's habitation therein. In 1383 came Wat Tyler's rising; the\r\nvilleins demanded a commutation of agricultural labor to a money rent\r\n(four pence) and full freedom of trade and labor in all the market\r\ntowns; and about this time was great growth of small freeholders.\r\n\r\n(1388) The Statute of Richard II restricts laborers to their hundred\r\nand makes it compulsory for them to follow the same trade as their\r\nfather after the age of twelve. The wages of both industrial and\r\nagricultural laborers are again fixed-shepherds, ten shillings a year;\r\nploughmen, seven; women laborers, six shillings, and so on. Servants\r\nare permitted to carry bows and arrows, but not swords, and they may\r\nnot play tennis or foot-ball. And here is the historical origin of\r\nthe important custom of exacting recommendations: servants leaving\r\nemployment are required to carry a testimonial, and none are to\r\nreceive servants without such letter--the original of the blacklist.\r\nHere, also, we find the beginning of poor-law legislation, those\r\nunable to work are to be supported in the town where born. Villeinage,\r\nwhich began at the Norman Conquest, according to Fitz-Herbert,\r\n\"because the Conqueror gave lordships with all the inhabitants to do\r\nwith them at their pleasure to his principal followers, and they,\r\nneeding servants, pardoned the inhabitants of their lives, and caused\r\nthem to do all manner of service\"--was now abolished by compensation\r\nin a money wage payment. The institution of villeinage is last\r\nmentioned in a commission of Queen Elizabeth, 1574, directing Lord\r\nBurleigh and others in certain counties to compound with all such\r\nbondmen or bondwomen for their manumission and freedom.\r\n\r\n(1389) The next year the practice of fixing wages at a permanent sum\r\nis abandoned and they are to be fixed semi-annually at Easter and\r\nMichaelmas by a justice of the peace. In 1402 we find the remarkable\r\nprovision that laborers are not to work on feast days nor for more\r\nthan half a day before a holiday. Such legislation would hardly be\r\nnecessary in modern England, where, in many trades, no one works for\r\na whole day after the holiday as well. In 1425 is another statute\r\nforbidding masons to confederate themselves in chapters; and in 1427\r\nthe attempt to fix wages by law is again abandoned and they are to\r\nbe fixed by the justices as in 1389, \"because Masters could not get\r\nServants without giving higher Wages than allowed by the Statute.\"\r\n\r\n(1436) Now, perhaps, we find the first use of the expression\r\n\"restraint of trade,\" that most important phrase, in a statute\r\nforbidding by-laws of guilds or corporate companies \"in restraint of\r\ntrade,\" also forbidding unlawful ordinances by them as to the price\r\nof their wares \"_for their own profit and to the common, hurt of the\r\npeople_,\" and such by-laws are made penal and invalid except when\r\napproved by the chancellor; and this statute of Henry VI is re-enacted\r\nagain in 1503 under Henry VII, where by-laws of guilds, etc.,\r\nrestraining suits at law are made unlawful, and so \"_ordinances\r\nagainst the common weal of the people_.\" The meaning and importance of\r\nsuch legislation as this has been, I hope, made clear above. Note the\r\nwords \"_to the common hurt of the people_\" and \"_against the common\r\nweal of the people_.\" From this century, at least, therefore, dates\r\nthat doctrine of the common law which makes unlawful any contract or\r\ncombination in restraint of trade, and it was left for the succeeding\r\ncentury to develop the last great principle, that against monopoly,\r\ncaused either by unlawful combination of individuals or grant by the\r\ncrown itself.\r\n\r\nThe right to labor or to trade was thus fully established in England,\r\nand from the very earliest times we find statutes that merchants may\r\nfreely buy and sell. The Statute of York, to this effect (1335), is\r\nre-enacted sixteen years later, and again under Richard II in 1391;\r\nand their right to carry away one-half the value of their imports in\r\nmoney, spending the other half in English commodities, in 1401.\r\n\r\nThis general right of trade may be defined as the right of any man\r\nto work at what trade he chose, and to buy or sell what and where he\r\nwill, in the cheapest market. This right was indeed fundamental and\r\nneeded no express statute. But all these laws concerning by-laws or\r\ncombinations to prevent people from exercising their trade, or showing\r\nwhat were the liberties of trade in London and other towns (of which\r\nthere are many) are exemplifications of it. That this law is far older\r\nthan the statutes is well shown by an actual law report of a case\r\ndecided in 1221 and first published by the Selden Society in 1877:\r\n\r\n\"The Abbot of Lilleshall complains that the bailiffs of Shrewsbury\r\ndo him many injuries against his liberty, and that they have caused\r\nproclamation to be made in the town that none be so bold as to sell\r\nany merchandise to the Abbot or his men upon pain of forfeiting ten\r\nshillings, and that Richard Peche, the bedell of the said town, made\r\nthis proclamation by their orders. And the bailiffs defend all of it,\r\nand Richard likewise defends all of it and that he never heard any\r\nsuch proclamation made by anyone. It is considered that he do defend\r\nhimself twelve-handed (with eleven compurgators), and do come on\r\nSaturday with his law.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a remarkable report, for in twelve lines (ten lines of the law\r\nLatin) we have here set forth all the important principles of the law\r\nof boycott. The abbot complains that the Shrewsbury people do him\r\nmany injuries \"against his liberty,\" _i.e._, the abbot claims a\r\nconstitutional right to freely conduct his own business; then we have\r\nthe recognition of the threat of a boycott as a particularly illegal\r\nact: \"They have caused _proclamation_ to be made that none sell\r\nmerchandise to the abbot.\" This is nothing but our modern \"unfair\r\nlist.\" The defendants admit the illegality of their conspiracy,\r\nbecause they deny it as a fact; and the bedell likewise denies that he\r\never made such proclamation or threat, whereupon (the plaintiff being\r\na man of the church) they are set to trial by wager of law instead of\r\nby actual battle, neither party nor the court making any question of\r\nthe illegality both of the conspiracy and of the act complained of.\r\n\r\nThere is no question then that all contracts in unreasonable restraint\r\nof trade were always unlawful in England and are so therefore by\r\nour common law. There was probably no real necessity for any of our\r\nanti-trust acts, except to impose penalties, or, as to the Federal or\r\nSherman Act so-called, to extend the principles of the common law to\r\ninterstate commerce, which is under the exclusive jurisdiction of the\r\nFederal government. The common law, however, made the exception of\r\n_reasonable_ restraint of trade, which the Sherman Act does not; that\r\nis to say, a contract between two persons, one of whom sells his\r\nbusiness and good-will to the other and agrees not to embark in the\r\nsame trade for a certain number of years or in a certain prescribed\r\nlocality, was a reasonable restriction at the common law. So, if two\r\nmerchants going down town to their business agree in the street car\r\nthat they will charge a certain amount for a barrel of flour or a ton\r\nof coal that week, this would probably be regarded as reasonable at\r\nthe common law; but the common law, like these early statutes of\r\nEngland, looked primarily, if not exclusively, to the welfare of the\r\nconsumer; they always speak of the common weal of the people, or\r\nof combinations to the general hurt of the people, and general\r\ncombinations to fix prices or to limit output are therefore always\r\nunlawful; so a combination that only one of them should exercise a\r\ncertain business at a certain place--like that of our four great\r\nmeatpacking firms, who are said to have arranged to have the buyer\r\nfor each one in turn appear in the cattle market, thus being the\r\nonly buyer that day--would be unlawful, when the restraint of trade\r\nresulting from an ordinary purchase would not be.\r\n\r\nThe fixing of ordinary prices, not tolls, was thoroughly tried in the\r\nMiddle Ages and failed. Nor has it been attempted since as to wages,\r\nexcept in New Zealand by arbitration, and in England and (as to public\r\nlabor) in the State of New York and a few other States where we have a\r\nrecent statute that all employment in public work (that is, work\r\nfor any city, county, or town, or the State, or for any contractor\r\ntherefor) must be paid for \"at the usual rate of wages prevailing in\r\nthe trade\"; this principle, taken from the last form of the English\r\nStatute of Laborers, being passed in the interest of the laborers\r\nthemselves and not of the employers, as it was in early England. The\r\nresult of this first piece of legislation was to impose some twenty\r\nthousand lawsuits upon the city of New York alone; the laborers\r\nworking for a year or two at the rates paid by the city and then,\r\nafter discharge, bringing suit and claiming that they had not been\r\npaid the \"usual rate\" of the trade; and as there were very heavy\r\npenalties, it is said to have cost the city of New York many millions\r\nof dollars. In the same way the union idea of having all trades under\r\nthe control of an organization was carried to its extreme result in\r\nthe Middle Ages also, so that the guilds became all-powerful; they\r\nimposed their rules and regulations to such an extent that it was\r\nalmost impossible for any man to get employment except by their\r\npermission and under their regulation, or without membership. They\r\nnaturally developed into wealthy combinations, more of employers than\r\nof journeymen, until they ended as the richly endowed dinner-giving\r\ncorporations that we see in the city of London to-day. In France, at\r\nleast, they were considered the greatest menace to labor, and were all\r\nswept away at the time of the French Revolution amid the joy of the\r\nmasses and the pealing of bells. Unfortunately, our labor leaders are\r\nsometimes scornful of history and unmindful of past example; the\r\nfact that a thing has been tried and failed or has, in past history,\r\ndeveloped in a certain manner, carries no conviction to their minds.\r\n\r\n(1444) A servant in husbandry had to give six months' notice before\r\nleaving and wages were again fixed; and in 1452, the time of Jack\r\nCade's Rebellion, one finds the first prototype of \"government\r\nby injunction,\" that is to say, of the interference by the lord\r\nchancellor or courts of equity with labor and the labor contract,\r\nparticularly in times of riot or disorder.\r\n\r\nBut the first trace of this practice, now obnoxious to many under\r\nthe phrase quoted, dates back to 1327, when King Edward III found it\r\nnecessary to adopt some more effectual measures of police than those\r\nwhich already existed. For this purpose justices of the peace were\r\nfirst instituted throughout the country with power to take security\r\nfor the peace and bind over parties who threatened offence.[1] Fifty\r\nyears later, in the reign of Richard II, it was found necessary to\r\nprovide further measures for repressing forcible entries on lands.\r\nThe course of justice was interrupted and all these provisions were\r\nrendered in a great degree ineffectual by the lawless spirit of the\r\ntimes. The Statute of 1379 recites that \"our Sovereign Lord the King\r\nhath perceived ... that divers of his Liege People claiming to have\r\nRight to divers Lands, Tenements, and other Possessions, and some\r\nespying Women and Damsels unmarried ... do gather them together to a\r\ngreat Number of Men of Arms and Archers ... not having Consideration\r\nto God, but refusing and setting apart all Process of the Law, do ride\r\nin great Routs ... and take Possession of Lands and in some Places\r\ndo ravish Women and Damsels, and bring them into strange Countries.\"\r\nTherefore the Statute of Northampton, the 2d of Edward III, is recited\r\nand confirmed and the justices of the king's commission ordered to\r\narrest such persons incontinent without tarrying for indictment or\r\nother process of law. But that this summary process was already\r\nobnoxious to the people was shown by the fact that it was repealed the\r\nvery following year because the articles \"seemeth to the said Commons\r\nvery grievous.\" Only the Statute of Northampton is preserved, and\r\nthose who had been so taken and imprisoned by virtue of said article\r\nwithout other indictment \"shall be utterly delivered.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Injunctions in Conspiracy Cases,\" Senate Document\r\nNo. 190, 57th Congress, 1st Session, p. 117.]\r\n\r\n(1384) It is noteworthy that at the same time that this\r\nextra-common-law process begins in the statutes, we have other\r\nstatutes vindicating the power of the common-law courts. For instance,\r\nsix years later, in the 8th of Richard II is a clause complaining that\r\n\"divers Pleas concerning the Common Law, and which by the Common Law\r\nought to be examined and discussed, are of late drawn before the\r\nConstable and Marshal of England, to the great Damage and Disquietness\r\nof the People.\" Such jurisdiction is forbidden and the common law\r\n\"shall be executed and used, and have that which to it belongeth ...\r\nas it was accustomed to be in the time of King Edward.\" Again, four\r\nyears later, it is ordained \"that neither Letters of the Signet, nor\r\nof the King's Privy Seal, shall be from henceforth sent in Damage or\r\nPrejudice of the Realm, nor in Disturbance of the Law.\"\r\n\r\n(1388) The next year we find a new Statute of Laborers confirming all\r\nprevious statutes and forbidding any servant or laborer to depart from\r\nservice without letters testimonial, and if found wandering without\r\nsuch letters shall be put in the stocks. Short of the penalty of the\r\nstocks, a condition of things not very dissimilar is said to exist\r\nto-day in the non-union mining towns of the West. In Cripple Creek,\r\nfor instance, no one is allowed without a card from his previous\r\nemployer which, among other things, sets forth that he is not\r\nassociated with any labor union. This Statute of Richard II also\r\nprovides that artificers and people of Mystery, that is to say,\r\nhandicraftsmen, shall be compelled to do agricultural labor in harvest\r\ntime. (The high prices of to-day, some one has said, are really caused\r\nnot so much by the trusts or even by the tariff, as by voluntary\r\nidleness; if a man will not work, neither shall he eat, but the lesson\r\nhas been forgotten! In the more prosperous parts of the country, in\r\nMassachusetts, for instance, it is sometimes impossible to give away\r\na standing crop of grain for the labor of cutting it, nor can\r\nable-bodied labor be secured even at two dollars per day. The\r\nConstitution of Oklahoma, which goes to the length of providing that\r\nthere shall be no property except in the fruits of labor, might\r\nlogically have embodied the principle of this Statute of Richard II;\r\nand we know that in Kansas they invite vacation students to harvest\r\ntheir crop. So in France, practically every one turns out for the\r\nvendange, and in Kent for the hops; a merriment is made of it, but\r\nat least the crop is garnered.) The Statute of Richard goes on to\r\ncomplain of the outrageous and excessive hire of labor, and attempts\r\nonce more to limit the prices, but already at more than double those\r\nnamed in the earlier statute: ploughmen seven pence, herdsmen six\r\npence, and even women six pence a day, and persons who have served in\r\nhusbandry until the age of twelve must forever continue to do so.\r\nThey may not learn a trade or be bound as apprentices. Servants and\r\nlaborers may not carry arms nor play at foot-ball or tennis; they\r\nare encouraged, however, to have bows and arrows and use the same on\r\nSundays and holidays. Impotent beggars are to be supported by the town\r\nwhere they were born.\r\n\r\n(1387) The barons protested that they would never suffer the kingdom\r\nto be governed by the Roman law, and the judges prohibited it from\r\nbeing any longer cited in the common-law tribunals;[1] and in 1389 we\r\nfind another statute complaining of the courts of the constable and\r\nmarshal having cognizance of matters which can be determined by the\r\ncommon law, and forbidding the same; and the statute of the previous\r\nyear concerning laborers is confirmed, except that wages are to be\r\nfixed by a justice of the peace, \"Forasmuch as a Man cannot put the\r\nPrice of Corn and other Victuals in certain.\" Shoemakers are forbidden\r\nto be tanners, and tanners to be shoemakers; a statute which seems\r\nto have been much debated, for it is continually being repealed and\r\nre-enacted for a hundred years to follow.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Spence, I Eq. Jur., 346.]\r\n\r\n(1392) The Statute of York, giving free trade to merchants, is\r\nre-enacted, and it is specified that they may sell in gross or by\r\nretail \"notwithstanding any Franchise, Grant or Custom,\" but they are\r\nforbidden to sell to each other for purposes of regrating and they\r\nmust sell wines in the original package and \"Spicery by whole Vessels\r\nand Bales.\" \"All the weights and measures throughout the Realm\r\nshall be according to the Standard of the Exchequer\"--save only in\r\nLancashire, where they are used to giving better measure.\r\n\r\n(1402) Laborers are forbidden to be hired by the week or to be paid\r\nfor holidays or half days. In 1405 the old Statute of Laborers is\r\nre-enacted, particularly the cruel law forbidding any one to take up\r\nany other trade than husbandry after the age of twelve, nor can any\r\none bind his child as apprentice to learn a trade unless he has twenty\r\nshillings per annum in landed property.\r\n\r\n(1414) The 2d of Henry V recites the Statute of the 13th of Henry\r\nIV against rioters, but power to suppress them is intrusted to the\r\njustices of the peace and the common-law courts \"according to the law\r\nof the land.\" Only if default is made in suppressing them the king's\r\ncommission goes out under the great seal, showing the beginning of\r\nthe use of the executive arm in suppressing riots, of which our\r\nmost famous instance was the action of President Cleveland in the\r\nPullman-car strike in Chicago in 1893. And in the same statute the\r\nchancery arm is invoked, that is to say, if any person complain that\r\na rioter or offender flee or withdraw himself, a bill issues from\r\nthe chancery, and if the person do not appear and yield, a writ of\r\nproclamation issues that he be attainted, a more severe punishment\r\nthan the six months' imprisonment usually meted out to our contemners.\r\nIt is interesting to notice that the bills (petitions for legislation)\r\nare now in English; though the statutes enacted are still in French or\r\nLatin.\r\n\r\n(1425) A statute recites that \"by the yearly Congregations and\r\nConfederacies made by the Masons in their general Chapiters and\r\nAssemblies, the good Course and Effect of the Statute of Labourers be\r\nopenly violated ... and such Chapiters and Congregations are forbidden\r\nand all Masons that come to them are to be punished by imprisonment\r\nand fine\"--an excellent example of the kind of statute which led to\r\nthe doctrine that trades-unions were forbidden by the common law of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\n(1427) The next year the attempt to fix wages by law is again\r\nabandoned, and they are to be fixed by the justices, \"because Masters\r\ncannot get Servants without giving higher Wages than allowed by the\r\nStatute.\"\r\n\r\nThe exact time of the appearance of the modern corporation has been\r\na matter of some doubt. Its invention was probably suggested by the\r\nmonastic corporation, or the city guild. This whole matter must be\r\nleft for a later chapter, but we must note the phraseology of a\r\nstatute of Henry VI in 1426, which speaks of \"Guilds, Fraternities,\r\nand other Companies corporate,\" and requiring them to record before\r\njustices of the peace all their charters, letters-patent, and\r\nordinances or by-laws, _which latter must not be against the common\r\nprofit of the people_, and the justices of the peace or chief marshal\r\nare given authority to annul such of their by-laws as are not\r\nreasonable and for the common profit--the fountain and origin of a\r\nmost important doctrine of the modern law of restraint of trade and\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\n(1444) Servants in husbandry purposing to leave their masters were\r\nrequired to give warning by the middle of the term of service so that\r\nthe \"Master may provide another Servant against the End of his Term.\"\r\nAgain a maximum price is fixed for the wages of servants, laborers,\r\nand artificers: the common servant of husbandry, fifteen shillings a\r\nyear, with money for clothing, eleven shillings; and women servants\r\nten shillings, with clothing price of four shillings, and meat and\r\ndrink. But winter wages are less and harvest wages more than in\r\nsummer; and men who refuse to serve by the year are declared\r\nvagabonds.\r\n\r\n(1450) John Cade was attainted of treason, and in 1452 comes the\r\nfamous statute giving the chancellor power to issue writs of\r\nproclamation against rioters or persons guilty of other offences\r\nagainst the peace, with power to outlaw upon default, quoted by\r\nSpence[1] as the foundation of the practice of issuing injunctions\r\nto preserve the peace, now bitterly complained of by Mr. Gompers and\r\nothers; and it is most noteworthy as sustaining this adverse view\r\nthat the Statute of Henry VI itself makes special exception, \"That no\r\nMatter determinable by the Law of this Realm shall be by the same Act\r\ndetermined in other Form than after the Course of the same Law in\r\nthe King's Courts having Determination of the same Law,\" and the act\r\nitself is only to endure for seven years.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"1 Eq. Jur.,\" 353.]\r\n\r\n(1487) This year a Statute of Henry VII originates the criminal\r\njurisdiction of the Court of Star Chamber,[1] an interesting statute\r\nreciting that the Mayor and Aldermen of London have forbidden citizens\r\nto go to fairs or markets, or trade outside the city, which is\r\ndeclared \"contrary to the common weal of England\" and the ordinance\r\nmade void. In 1495 the laws against riots and unlawful assemblies are\r\nrecited and confirmed, and authority to punish and prevent them given\r\nto the justices and the common-law courts, except that the justices\r\nthemselves in a case of such disorder by more than forty persons are\r\nto certify the names of the offenders to the king and his council\r\n(that is to say, the Star Chamber) for punishment. In 1495 the\r\nwages of servants in husbandry and of artificers and shipwrights,\r\nmaster-masons and carpenters are again fixed, with the hours of work\r\nand meal time provided; in March, from 5 a.m. till 7 or 8 p.m., but\r\nwith half an hour for breakfast, an hour and a half for dinner, and\r\nhalf an hour for supper, and in winter time from dawn till sunset, and\r\n\"said Artificers and Laborers shall slepe not by day\" except between\r\nMay and August; but this whole act \"for the common wealth of the poor\r\nartificers\" is repealed the following year.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This court, says Lord Coke, was originally established to\r\nprotect subjects against the offences and oppressions of great men by\r\nextortion, frauds, riots, unlawful assemblies, etc., leaving ordinary\r\noffences to the courts of common law, and Clarendon adds that \"whilst\r\nit was gravely and moderately governed, it was an excellent expedient\r\nto preserve the peace and security of the kingdom.\" Nevertheless,\r\n\"having become odious by a tyrannical exercise of its powers, it was\r\nabolished by a Statute of 16 Charles I.\"]\r\n\r\n(1503) This year there is another important statute against private\r\nand illegal by-laws, reciting that \"companies corporate by color of\r\nrule and governance to them granted and confirmed by charters and\r\nletters patent of divers Kings made among themselves many unlawful and\r\nunreasonable ordinances as well in price of wares as other things for\r\ntheir own singular profit and to the common hurt and damage of the\r\npeople,\" and such by-laws are forbidden unless specially authorized by\r\nsome official such as the chief governor of the city. The law so\r\nfar dates from the 15th of Henry VI; but the present act goes on to\r\nprovide that \"no masters, fellowships of crafts or rulers of guilds or\r\nfraternities make any acts or ordinances against the common profit of\r\nthe people but with the examination and approval of the Chancellor and\r\nChief Justice of England, and that there shall never be any by-law to\r\nrestrain any person from suits in the common-law courts.\" A Federal\r\nstatute similar to this was proposed by a late president to apply\r\nto all corporations, or at least to all corporations conducting\r\ninterstate commerce; the approval of their by-laws or other contracts\r\nto be by the Federal commissioner of corporations; while the last\r\nsection forbidding trades-unions to deny to their members the right\r\nof suing them or other persons in the ordinary courts is part of\r\nour constitutional law to-day and much objected to by the unions\r\nthemselves, as it was in the time of Henry VII The tendency to create\r\nspecial courts (commerce, patents, etc.) seems to be beginning anew,\r\ndespite the malign history of the ancient courts of the Constable and\r\nMarshal, Star Chamber, Requests, Royal Commissions, etc.\r\n\r\n(1512) Under Henry VIII the penalty for paying higher wages than the\r\nlaw allowed was removed from the employer and applied only to the\r\nemployee taking the wage; and in 1514 comes perhaps the most elaborate\r\nof all the earlier acts fixing the wages and hours of labor. Their\r\nmeal times and sleep times are carefully regulated, they are forbidden\r\nto take full wages for half-day's work and forbidden to leave a job\r\nuntil it is finished, and the rates of pay of bailiffs, servants,\r\nfree masons, master carpenters, rough masons, bricklayers, tilers,\r\nplumbers, glaziers, carvers, joiners, shipwrights, ship carpenters,\r\ncalkers, clinchers, agricultural laborers, both men and women, mowers,\r\nreapers, carters, shepherds, herdsmen, and possibly others, are again\r\nprescribed; this list of trades in the England of the early sixteenth\r\ncentury is interesting. Bailiffs who assault their overseers may be\r\nimprisoned for a year, and an exception is made from the act of\r\nall miners of lead, iron, silver, tin, or coal, \"called See Cole,\r\notherwise called Smythes Coole,\" or for making of glass, but that part\r\nof the act fixing wages was repealed the very next year as to the city\r\nof London.\r\n\r\n(1514) The abuse of monopolies begins to be shown this year (but see\r\nalso 1503, above) in a statute complaining of the grant of second\r\npatents of a matter already granted; and avoiding in such cases the\r\nlater patent unless the king express that \"he hath determined his\r\npleasure against the first.\"\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the gypsies in England is marked by a statute\r\nof 1530, describing them as \"outlandish people called Egyptians,\"\r\ncomplaining of their robberies, and requiring them to depart the\r\nrealm. In the same year first appeared the celebrated Act for the\r\npunishment of beggars and vagabonds and forbidding beggary, and\r\nrequiring them to labor or be whipped. Herbert Spencer states in his\r\n\"Descriptive Sociology\" that it punishes with loss of an ear the third\r\nconviction for joining a trades-union, which, if true, would justify\r\nmuch of the bitterness of modern labor unions against the common\r\nlaw. The provision evidently referred to (22 Henry VIII, chapter 12,\r\nsection 4) applies, however, not to guilds, but to \"Scolers of the\r\nUniversities of Oxford and Cambridge that go about begging not being\r\nauthorized under the seal of the said Universities\" as well as to\r\nother beggars or vagabonds playing \"subtile, crafty and unlawful games\r\nsuch as physnomye or palmestrye.\" The same year is an Interesting\r\nstatute against foreign artificers exercising handicrafts in England,\r\nnot without example in the labor legislation of our modern States;\r\nbut exempting beggars, brewers, surgeons, and scriveners as not\r\nhandicraftsmen, possibly the origin of the vulgar notion that those\r\ntrades are more genteel than skilled labor.\r\n\r\n(1535) Another statute against sturdy vagabonds and \"rufflers found\r\nidling after being assigned to labor,\" and already having their ears\r\nso slit, are punishable with death. This year Wales was joined to\r\nEngland; and we see the first act for the suppression of monasteries;\r\nthe next year came the statute extinguishing the authority of the\r\nBishop of Rome. With the struggle against the Roman Church went\r\nthe contest for freedom; _inter arma silent leges_; sociological\r\nlegislation came to an end for the rest of the reign and arbitrary\r\nlaws passed at the king's desire; in 1536, the act authorizing kings\r\nof England, on arriving at the age of twenty-four, to repeal any act\r\nof Parliament made during their minority, and in 1539 the \"Act that\r\nProclamations made by the King shall be obeyed\"--the high-water mark\r\nof executive usurpation in modern times. Proclamations made by the\r\nking and council were to have the force of acts of Parliament, yet not\r\nto prejudice estates, offices, liberties, goods or lives, or repeal\r\nexisting laws; the cardinal constitutional rights were thus preserved,\r\neven as against this royal aggression.\r\n\r\n(1548) Under Edward VI and Elisabeth we may expect more enlightened\r\nlegislation, and are not disappointed. Indeed, no one can read the\r\nstatutes of the great queen without seeing that modern times here\r\nbegin. Nevertheless, while trade is becoming free, labor is no less\r\nseverely, if more intelligently, regulated. We first note a short\r\nbut important statute touching victuallers and handicraftsmen, worth\r\nquoting in part: \"Forasmuche as of late dayes divers sellers of\r\nvittayles, not contented withe moderate and reasonable gayne ...\r\nhave conspyred and covenanted together to sell their vittels at\r\nunreasonable price; and lykewise Artyficers handycrafte men and\r\nlaborers have made confederacyes and promyses and have sworne mutuall\r\nothes, not onlye that they shoulde not meddle one withe an others\r\nworke, and performe and fynishe that an other hathe begone, but also\r\nto constitute and appoynt howe muche worke they shoulde doe in a daye\r\nand what bowers and tymes they shall work, _contrarie to the Lawes and\r\nStatutes of this Realme_\" (It is extraordinary how closely this old\r\nstatute sets forth some practices of the modern trades-union.) \"Everie\r\nperson so conspiring covenantinge swearing or offendinge ... shall\r\nforfeyt for the firste offence tenne pounds ... or twentie dayes\r\nymprisonment\" with bread and water; for the second offence, twenty\r\npounds or the pillory, and for the third offence forty pounds, or the\r\npillory and lose one of his ears. After that he is to be taken as a\r\nman infamous and his oath not to be credited at any time, and if\r\nthere be a corporation of dealers in victuals or of handicraftsmen so\r\nconspiring, it shall be dissolved--the origin and precedent of the\r\nSherman Act! This, of course, is the statute which Herbert Spencer\r\ncites as making a \"third conviction for joining a trades-union\r\npunished with loss of an ear\"; but he places the date at 1535 instead\r\nof 1548. The statute, however, goes on to provide absolute freedom of\r\nemployment or trade for all skilled mechanics in any town, although\r\nnot freemen thereof, whether they dwell there or not, any town or\r\nguild by-law to the contrary notwithstanding; so that this important\r\nstatute may be said to establish the most enlightened view that there\r\nmust be absolute liberty of employment granted any one, only that they\r\nmust not conspire to the injury of others. Unfortunately, in the\r\nvery next year this last part is repealed as to the city of London,\r\n\"Artificers and Craftmen of that ancient City complaining that it was\r\ncontrary to their ancient privilege,\" a view as modern as is the law\r\nitself. Immediately after this law is one providing that journeymen,\r\nclothiers, weavers, tailors, and shoemakers shall not be hired for\r\nless than a quarter of a year on penalty of Imprisonment to them\r\nand the employer, the statute reciting that, once out of their\r\napprenticehood, they \"will not commonly be retained in service by\r\nthe year, but at their liberty by the day, week or otherwise, to the\r\nintent that they will live idly, and at their pleasure flee and resort\r\nfrom place to place, whereof ensuith more incovenyencies then can be\r\nat this present expressed and declared\"--an inconvenience not unknown\r\nin modern intelligence offices. All employers having more than three\r\napprentices shall keep at least one journeyman, and unmarried servants\r\nin husbandry must serve by the year.\r\n\r\n(1550) In the 3d of Edward VI we find the first Riot Act, aimed at\r\npersons to the number of twelve or above assembling together and\r\nproposing to alter the laws and not dispersing when so required by\r\nthe sheriff, and even persons more than two and less than twelve\r\nassembling for such purpose are subject to fine and imprisonment with\r\ntreble damages to parties injured, and if forty persons so assemble\r\nand do not disperse in three hours, they are declared felons. This\r\nstatute was re-enacted and made more severe in the reign of Queen\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n(1562) In the 5th of Elizabeth comes the last and greatest Statute of\r\nLaborers. This statute is a consolidation of all previous laws, and\r\nit begins by recognizing the principle that the fixing of wages is a\r\nmistake and all such laws are repealed so far as they relate to terms\r\nof hiring and wages. Servants in certain employments, generally\r\nspeaking the tailoring and shoemaking trades, may still be hired\r\nby the year, and persons unmarried, not having an income of forty\r\nshillings a year, may be compelled to serve in their own handicraft.\r\nSuch yearly servants may not be dismissed or depart during the year\r\nexcept by cause allowed by two justices, nor at the end of a year,\r\nwithout a quarter's warning. Unmarried persons under thirty, not\r\nhaving any trade and not belonging to a nobleman's household, may\r\nbe compelled to labor at the request of any person using an art or\r\nmystery, and all persons between twelve and sixty not otherwise\r\nemployed may be compelled to serve by the year in husbandry. The\r\nmasters may not dismiss, nor the servants unduly depart; nor leave the\r\ncity or parish of their service without a testimonial; that is to say,\r\na certificate of due cause under the seal of the town or constable and\r\ntwo honest householders. The hours of labor are still fixed from 5\r\nA.M. to 7 P.M., between March and September, with two and one-half\r\nhours for meal times, drink times, and sleep. From September to May,\r\nfrom dawn to sunset, and sleep times only allowed from May to\r\nAugust. A penalty of one month's imprisonment and fine is imposed on\r\nartificers and laborers leaving their work unfinished. Wages are still\r\nto be fixed by the justices of the peace, and it is made a penal\r\noffence to give or receive higher wages than the lawful rate, and all\r\ncontracts for higher wages are void. Unmarried women between twelve\r\nand forty may be compelled to serve in like manner, and everybody\r\nhas to work at harvest time, that is to say, artificers as well as\r\nlaborers. The elaborate law of apprenticeship dates also from this\r\ngreat statute, and no one can use a manual art who has not been\r\napprenticed to the same for seven years. One journeyman shall be kept\r\nfor each three apprentices; disputes are to be settled by the justices\r\nof the peace, and indeed the whole labor contract is regulated as\r\ncarefully as the most statute-mad of modern labor leaders could\r\ndesire, though hardly, perhaps, then, in the sole interest of the\r\nworkingman. If this statute was ever repealed, it was in very recent\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\n(1571) The year of the statute against fraudulent conveyances, and\r\nof another poor law, with provisions for the punishment of \"rogues,\r\nvagabonds and sturdy beggars,\" who are defined to include those going\r\nabout the country \"using sybtyll craftye and unlawfull Games or Playes\r\n... Palmestrye ... or fantasticall Imaginacons.... Fencers Bearewardes\r\nand Common Players,\" and the penalty for harboring such vagabonds was\r\ntwenty shillings. We are a long time from the knighting of Sir Henry\r\nIrving. In 1575 comes another act for setting the poor to work, and\r\nthe punishing of tramps and beggars.\r\n\r\nIn 1571 also is the first formal complaint of monopolies by the\r\nCommons. Coal, oil, salt, vinegar, starch, iron, glass, and many other\r\ncommodities were all farmed out to individuals and monopolies; coal,\r\nmentioned first, is still, to-day, the subject of our greatest\r\nmonopoly; while oil, mentioned fourth, is probably the subject of our\r\nsecond greatest monopoly; and iron, mentioned seventh, is probably the\r\nthird. Conditions have not changed. The only reason we don't have salt\r\nstill a monopoly is on account of the numerous sources and processes\r\nfor obtaining it from mines and from the sea; Fugger, the John D.\r\nRockefeller of the sixteenth century (whose portrait in Munich\r\nstrongly resembles him), had a monopoly of the salt mines of all\r\nGermany. The conditions have maintained themselves, even as to the\r\nvery articles. This grievance was first mooted in Parliament in 1571\r\nby a Mr. Bell, \"who was at once summoned before the Council.\" This\r\ncouncil was the King's Council, or Privy Council--a body roughly\r\ncorresponding to our United States Senate. He was summoned before the\r\ncouncil for objecting because coal, oil, salt, vinegar, starch, iron,\r\nglass, were the subjects of monopoly; and he \"returned to the House\r\nwith such an amazed countenance that it daunted all the rest.\" That is\r\nvery much the fate of the tariff reformer to-day, if we may credit the\r\ntales of those returning from Washington.\r\n\r\nAfter a lapse of twenty-six years the Commons ventured again. This\r\ntime the queen replied that she hoped her dutiful and loving subjects\r\nwould not take away her prerogative, which is the choicest flower\r\nin her garden, but promised to examine all patents and abide the\r\ntouchstone of the law. Nevertheless, four years later the list of\r\narticles subject to monopoly was so numerous that when it was read\r\nover to the House in 1601 an indignant member exclaimed: \"Is not bread\r\namongst them? Nay, if no remedy is found for these, bread will be\r\nthere before the next Parliament.\" The Populists openly cursed the\r\nmonopolies and declared that the prerogatives should not be suffered\r\nto touch the old liberties of England. Seeing that resistance was no\r\nlonger politic, Elizabeth sent a message to the House saying that some\r\nof these monopolies should be presently repealed, some superseded, and\r\nnone put in execution but such as should first have a trial according\r\nto law for the good of the people; and Robert Cecil, the secretary,\r\nadded an assurance that all existing patents should be revoked and no\r\nothers granted for the future. The Commons waited upon the queen with\r\nan address of thanks, to which she replied almost affectionately that\r\nnever since she had been queen \"did I put my pen to any grant but upon\r\npretence made to me that it was good and beneficial to the subjects in\r\ngeneral, though a private profit to some of my ancient servants who\r\nhad deserved well. Never thought was cherished in my heart which\r\ntended not to my people's good.\" Notwithstanding these fair words, the\r\nHouse of Commons found it necessary to enact the Great Statute against\r\nMonopolies.\r\n\r\n(1623) In the beginning, the statute recites that \"Your most excellent\r\nMajestie in your Royall Judgment ... did In the yeare ... 1610 ...\r\npublish in Print to the whole Realme and to all Posteritie, that all\r\nGraunt of Monapolyes and of the benefitt of any penall Lawes, or of\r\npower to dispence with the Lawe ... are contrary to your Majesties\r\nLawes, which your Majesties Declaracon is truly consonant and\r\nagreeable to the auncient and fundamentall Lawes of this your\r\nRealme.... Nevertheles ... many such Graunts have bene undulie\r\nobteyned ... For avoyding whereof and preventinge of the like in tyme\r\nto come, May it please your most excellent Majestic ... that it may be\r\ndeclared and enacted, and be it declared and enacted by the authoritie\r\nof this present Parliament That all Monapolies and all Commissions\r\nGraunts Licenses Charters and lettres patents heretofore made or\r\ngraunted, or hereafter to be made or graunted to any person or persons\r\nBodies Politique or Corporate whatsoever of or for the sole buyinge\r\nsellinge makinge workinge or usinge of any things within this Realme\r\nor the Dominion of Wales, or of any other Monopolies, or of Power\r\nLibertie or Facultie to dispence with any others, or to give Licence\r\nor Toleracon to doe use or exercise any thinge against the tenor or\r\npurport of any Lawe or Statute ... are altogether contrary to the laws\r\nof this realm and so are or shall be utterly void and in no wise to be\r\nput in use or execution.\" Section 2 provides that all such monopolies\r\nand the force and validity of them ought to be and should forever\r\nhereafter be examined, tried, and determined by and according to\r\nthe common law; section 4, that a party aggrieved might have treble\r\ndamages, as in our modern Sherman Act. There followed provisos for\r\nexempting existing patents for twenty-one years or less for new\r\ninventions or like future patents for fourteen years or less, the\r\ncharters of the city of London, or any custom or customs of London, or\r\nany other city or town, for corporations, companies, or fellowships of\r\nany art, trade, occupation, or mystery; that is to say, exempting the\r\nguilds, but these guilds by this time had long ceased to be societies\r\nof actual journeymen or handicraftsmen. This great statute may fairly\r\nbe classed among the constitutional documents of England, and it left\r\nthe great fabric of the English common law guaranteeing freedom of\r\nlabor and liberty of trade, Magna Charta itself recognizing this\r\nprinciple, and the Statute of Westminster I forbidding forestalling\r\nand excessive toll contrary to the laws of England, as it has remained\r\nuntil the present day--only rediscovered in the statutes of our\r\nSouthern and Western States aimed against trusts, and reapplied by\r\nCongress, in the Sherman Act, to interstate commerce; but in neither\r\ncase added to, nor, possibly, improved.\r\n\r\nTwo years before this great statute, the process of impeachment, not\r\nemployed for nearly two hundred years, had been revived against Sir\r\nGiles Mompesson and Sir Francis Mitchell, who in the Parliament of\r\n1621 were impeached \"for fraud and oppression committed as patentees\r\nfor the exclusive manufacture of gold and silver thread, for\r\nthe inspection of inns and hostelries, and for the licensing of\r\nale-houses. While no definite articles were presented according to\r\nmodern forms, an accusation was made by the Commons and a judgment\r\nrendered by the Lords, condemning both to fine, imprisonment, and\r\ndegradation from the honor of knighthood.\" Nevertheless, Charles\r\nI revived the system of monopolies and raised revenue by their\r\napplication to almost every article of ordinary consumption as well as\r\nby enormous fines inflicted through the Star Chamber, both important\r\nmatters leading to his dethronement.[1] Elizabeth granted monopolies\r\non the perfectly madern pretence that a monopoly, be it made by law or\r\nby tariff, is for the benefit of the public good, though at the same\r\ntime possibly a private profit to certain individuals, friends of the\r\nsovereign.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Dowell, \"History of Taxation,\" vol. I, pp. 204-209.]\r\n\r\nBut all this early legislation of England was far better and more\r\nadvanced than our own; for in all these questions of duties on exports\r\nand duties on imports and monopolies, they never consider the man who\r\nhas the monopoly, the producer; but always they are avowed to\r\nbe, petitioned for, declared to be, only in the interests of the\r\n_consumer_; which cannot be said to be the case with ourselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nOTHER LEGISLATION IN MEDIAEVAL ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n(1275) The Statute of Westminster I has sometimes been termed a great\r\nEnglish code; it is certainly a comprehensive statement by statute of\r\na considerable portion of existing law. In our consideration of\r\nlabor and conspiracy laws we have had to include statutes of later\r\ncenturies. Now, returning to the year of the Statute of Westminster,\r\nwe found, in 1275, also the Statute of Bigamy, aimed against priests\r\nwith more than one wife. It is to be noted that this was centuries\r\nbefore the celibacy of priests became one of the doctrines of the\r\nRoman Catholic Church. It is also interesting that this early statute\r\nrefers to the pope as \"the Bishop of Rome\"--but only as printed since\r\n1543.\r\n\r\n(1279) The Statute of Mortmain, aimed at the holding of land in large\r\nquantities by religious corporations, was a true constructive statute,\r\nand the principle it establishes has grown ever since. The law\r\nregards with jealousy the ownership of land by any corporation;\r\nthe presumption is against the power, and it extends to-day to all\r\ncorporations, and particularly to alien corporations (see chapter 7);\r\nand in 1283 came the Statute of Acton Burnel, re-enacted in 1285 and\r\ncalled the \"Statute Merchant,\" equally important. It provides for the\r\nspeedy recovery of debts due merchants, and is the foundation of all\r\nour modern law of pledge, sales of collateral, etc. It is distinctly\r\nan innovation on the common law; for in those days there was no method\r\nof collecting ordinary money debts. You could levy on a man's land,\r\nbut there really seems to have been no method of recovering a debt\r\ncontracted in trade; and this is the first of many statutes adopting\r\nforeign ideas as to matters of trade, and the customs of merchants,\r\ndrawn frequently from the Lombard or Jew traders of the Continent,\r\nwhich, by statute law, custom, or court decision, has since become\r\nsuch a considerable body of the English law as to have a name\r\nto itself--the \"Law Merchant.\" This first statute provides for\r\nimprisonment for debt; \"if he have no goods to be seized the debtor is\r\nto be imprisoned, but the creditor shall find him bread and water.\"\r\nA foreigner coming to England to recover a debt may also recover the\r\nexpenses of his trip; and the statute is further liberal in that it\r\ndoes away with the _Droit d'Aubaine_, that narrow-minded custom by\r\nwhich the goods or personal property of any person who died passing\r\nthrough the kingdom were seized by the authorities and could not be\r\nrecovered by his heirs. This mediaeval injustice continued for some\r\ncenturies in Germany and France, and we can hardly say that the notion\r\nis extinct in this country when a State like California, by her system\r\nof public administrators, practically impounds a large proportion of\r\nall personal property owned by non-residents at their death. Cases\r\nhave been known where it cost the executor more than one-third of\r\nthe money to collect a mortgage, owned by a deceased citizen of\r\nMassachusetts, in California; and for that reason, among others,\r\nEastern lawyers have advised against investments in that State; for\r\nthe public administrators are usually petty politicians in search of a\r\njob. The increasing burden of our State inheritance tax laws, whereby\r\nevery State wherein a corporation exists besides the State of the\r\ndeceased seizes its percentage of the stock of such corporation in the\r\nhands of the executors, is another step in this direction. This early\r\nStatute Merchant, liberal in other respects, still excludes Jews from\r\nits benefits.\r\n\r\n(1284) Jury trial was well established by this time, for the Statute\r\nof Wales includes it in its code of procedure for that principality.\r\nThe great Statute _De Donis_, or Westminster II, came the following\r\nyear; most interesting to lawyers as the foundation of estates tail;\r\nbut it also regulates \"assizes or juries\" that \"rich men do not abide\r\nat home by reason of their bribes.\" It also specifically requires\r\nindictment \"of twelve lawful men at least,\" and gives an action\r\nagainst sheriffs imprisoning without such warrant \"as they should have\r\nagainst any other person.\" Rape, ten years before made punishable only\r\nby two years' imprisonment, is now made an offence punishable by\r\nloss of life or member; showing how our ancestors treated a burning\r\nquestion, at least in our Southern States, of to-day. Finally, it\r\nconfirms and explains the writ _de odio et atia_, the predecessor of\r\nthe modern _habeas corpus_. Some writers have doubted whether this\r\nwrit existed as a practical remedy much before the Statute of Charles\r\nII; but here it says that parties indicted, etc., are to have the writ\r\n_de odio et atia_ \"lest they be kept long in prison, like as it is\r\ndeclared in Magna Charta.\" This can only refer to C. 36 of John's\r\nCharter, \"the writ of inquest of life or limb to be given gratis and\r\nnot denied\"; and taken in connection with the action for damages just\r\ngiven affords a fairly complete safeguard to personal liberty. It also\r\ncontains the first game law, protecting \"salmons.\" \"There are salmons\r\nin Wye,\" says Shakespeare, and we are reminded of it because the\r\nStatute of Winchester in the same year contains a provision that is\r\nalmost literally quoted by Dogberry in \"Twelfth Night.\" It provides\r\nfor the gates of great towns to be shut at sunset, and that no citizen\r\nshould bear arms, and no tavern sell drink after 9 P.M., and then it\r\ncomes to the duties of the watch, which are described in such like\r\nmanner that Dogberry's language seems a mere paraphrase. Whoever wrote\r\nthe play certainly had read the Statutes of the Realm for the year\r\n1285, but so far as I am aware, the Baconians have not yet called\r\nattention to this. And the same statute shows us how much better\r\npolice protection the England of 1285 gave than the New York or\r\nChicago of 1909; for all the people dwelling in the hundred or country\r\n(county) if they do not deliver the body of the offender, \"shall be\r\nanswerable for the robberies done and also the damages.\" The same year\r\nwas a statute of \"The common customs of the City of London,\" among\r\nwhich was one that \"taverns should not be open after 9 P.M. for the\r\nselling of wine or ale,\" a regulation for their \"tenderloin,\" which\r\nitself is described in quite modern terms; \"none shall walk the\r\nstreets after curfew.\" Possibly the same year is the Statute of\r\nBakers, with careful provisions against putrid meat, worthy of\r\nconsideration by our cold-storage plants. Butchers selling unwholesome\r\nflesh, or buying it of the Jews, were severely punished.\r\n\r\n(1289) The Statute of Quo Warranto is another historical landmark,\r\nshowing the jealousy our ancestors felt of officials, bureaucracy; a\r\nwrit specially devised to enable them to challenge the right of any\r\nmagnate who pretended to power by virtue of holding office, and the\r\npredecessor of our modern _quo warranto_, which we still use at all\r\ntimes for that purpose, not only as against officers but to test\r\nany special privileges or charters claimed, such as the right to a\r\nmonopoly, a franchise, a ferry, etc. These may be still tried by _quo\r\nwarranto_; meaning, by what warrant do you claim to exercise this\r\noffice, this monopoly, this privilege?\r\n\r\nAbout this time is another statute forbidding usury, and permitting\r\nChristian debtors to retain half of all debts they may owe to the\r\nJews, who are required to wear the mark of two cables joined on their\r\ncoats; and there is the great Statute of Westminster III, _Quia\r\nEmptores_, affecting land tenures, still of importance to the\r\nconveyancers. In 1295 we have the famous Model Parliament; that is to\r\nsay, the first one where kings, lords, and commons were joined, the\r\nlegislative branches sitting separately and the Commons represented.\r\nTwo years later Edward I, carrying on the war in Flanders, was\r\ncompelled to grant that great confirmation of the charters already\r\nreferred to, that no aid or tax should be taken but by the common\r\nconsent of the realm and for the common profit; restoring thus into\r\nthe recognized charter that important provision of the original\r\nCharter of John; and it provides that the great charter shall be read\r\ntwice a year in every cathedral in England. In our country I am aware\r\nof no provision for reading the Constitution, though the Declaration\r\nof Independence, an obsolete document, is occasionally read upon the\r\nFourth of July.\r\n\r\nIn 1305 the Anglo-Norman law reports begin, the Year Books. From then\r\nto now, at least, we have continuous written reports of all important\r\ncases decided in England. This is not to say that we do not have them\r\nbefore (our people, first in the world's history, has the records of\r\nall its cases in high courts for nigh a thousand years), but they are\r\nnow for the first time systematic.\r\n\r\n(1309) On the accession of Edward II came the Summary of Grievances,\r\nrecited in the Statute of Stamford as recognized by Edward I at the\r\nclose of his reign. The seizure of supplies by the king without due\r\npayment; the maintenance of courts at the gates of the king's castles\r\nin derogation of the common-law courts; the taking of \"new customs,\"\r\ntwo shillings per tun of wine, two shillings for cloth and other\r\nimports, \"_whereby the price to the people is enhanced\"_; the\r\ndebasement of current coin; that petitions of the Commons to\r\nParliament were not received, etc., etc. All duties were then\r\nsuspended, in order to know and be advised \"what Profit and Advantage\r\nwill accrue to him and his People by ceasing the taking of those\r\nCustoms\"--a precedent it were to be wished we might have the\r\nintelligence to follow to-day--surely better than a tariff commission!\r\n\r\nTwo years later came the New Ordinances, which contain a most\r\ninteresting precedent, hitherto almost unnoted, of the American\r\nprinciple of having the courts construe the Constitution. Section VI:\r\n\"It is Ordained, That the Great Charter be kept in all its points in\r\nsuch manner, that if there be in the said Charter any point obscure or\r\ndoubtful, it shall be declared by the said Ordainours, and others\r\nwhom they will, for that purpose, call to them, when they shall see\r\noccasion and season during their power.\" Section XXXVIII: \"That the\r\nGreat Charter ... and the Points which are doubtful in it be explained\r\nby the advice of the Baronage and of the Justices, and of other sage\r\nPersons of the Law.\" It was ordained that the king should not go out\r\nof the realm, a precedent never violated until modern times, and even\r\nfollowed by our own presidents, except for Roosevelt's trip to Panama\r\nand Taft's to the borders of Mexico. Again we find \"new customs\"\r\nabolished, \"as upon Wools, Cloths, Wines, Avoir de pois, and other\r\nThings, whereby the Merchants come more seldom, and bring fewer Goods\r\ninto the Land, and the Foreign Merchants abide longer than they were\r\nwont to do, by which abiding things become more dear,\" saving only to\r\nthe king his duty on wool and leather, half a mark for a sack of wool\r\nand one mark for a last of leather. \"The king shall hold a Parliament\r\nonce in the year or twice if need be, and that in a convenient place.\"\r\nThis principle has maintained itself in the English mind, still more\r\nin the American mind, ever since. To this day, in Massachusetts,\r\nfor instance, we cannot get a constitutional amendment to have the\r\nlegislature sit only once in two years, though it would probably be a\r\nvery wise reform, on account of this old inherited feeling that there\r\nis something peculiarly free about an annual parliament, as indeed\r\nthere is. The Anglo-Norman kings called parliaments once a year\r\nor oftener. Most of the States in this country now have their\r\nlegislatures sit every two years. Alabama and some other States have\r\nrecently changed, that they only sit once in four years. But the\r\nconservative old States, like Massachusetts and New Jersey, have still\r\nthe rule that the legislature sits every year; and the prejudice in\r\nfavor of the annual legislature goes back at least as far as this law\r\nof 1330, where the Commons succeeded in getting a law that Parliament\r\nshould sit as often as once in a year, and is incorporated in\r\nEngland's and Massachusetts' Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\nAnd then we find the first statute restraining what we should now call\r\nchancery jurisdiction, complaining that the law of the land and\r\ncommon right was delayed by letters issued under the king's will, and\r\nordaining that henceforth they shall not be disturbed by said letters\r\nand nothing done in any of the places of the court of the king or\r\nelsewhere by such letters against right or the law of the land shall\r\navail.\r\n\r\nIn 1313 the coming armed to Parliament is forbidden. These were\r\ntroublous times and there was little legislation in consequence,\r\nand in 1322 Edward II secured the revocation of the New Ordinances\r\nthemselves, but as in all such cases of royal grant and withdrawal\r\nthe principles shown are even the more important historically. Of\r\nuncertain period is the Statute of Jewrie forbidding usury to the\r\nJews, and Christians from living among them, but permitting them\r\nfreedom of trade and exempting them from taxation except to the king;\r\nand a statute of the usages and customs of the men of Kent beginning\r\nwith the statement that \"all the Bodies of Kentishmen be free, as well\r\nas the other free Bodies of England,\" which dates at least as late as\r\nthe early part of the fourteenth century, but still exemplifying the\r\nnotion that a statute should only express law or custom previously\r\nexisting.\r\n\r\n(1327) The Statute of Northampton, at the beginning of the reign of\r\nEdward III, confirms many of the earlier statutes, but abolishes all\r\nstaples beyond the sea and on this side, on the ground that they\r\ntended to monopoly, and provided that all merchants, strangers, and\r\ncitizens may go and come with their merchandises into England after\r\nthe tenor of the great charter (cap. IX). In the next year is another\r\nprovision for annual parliaments, and in 1335 the Statute of York\r\nagain allows merchants to buy and sell freely except only enemies, and\r\ngiving double damages for the disturbance by any one of such freedom\r\nof trade, and the Statute _de Moneta_, forbidding carrying money\r\nabroad; which is notable to the student of economics as showing how\r\nearly what we now call the fallacy of the mercantile system appeared.\r\nOur ancestors thought that there was something peculiarly advantageous\r\nin a tariff or system of duties which put all the money into a country\r\nand allowed only goods to go out; and that opinion is perhaps not yet\r\nextinct.\r\n\r\nThere always seems to have been a notion that there is something\r\npeculiarly sacred about wool. So we find that in 1337 they made it\r\na felony to carry wool out of England, or to wear cloth made out of\r\nEngland; and no clothes made beyond the seas were to be brought into\r\nEngland. That notion that a man ought to dress on home products lies\r\nbehind our present McKinley tariff. Then, in 1340, you will find\r\nanother statute for the liberties of merchants, that they should be\r\nallowed the freedom of the kingdom; and a new duty is imposed on wool.\r\nThen we find the abolition of the laws of \"the staple\"; foreign staple\r\ntowns had been abolished just before. The \"staple\" was the _town_ in\r\nwhich one commodity was mainly dealt in. Every commodity in England\r\nhad some particular town, where the principal market was for it; just\r\nas, with us, the boot and shoe market of the United States is supposed\r\nto be in Boston, the money market in New York, beef and hogs in\r\nChicago. In England, in the Middle Ages, they really provided that a\r\ncertain trade should have its home in a certain town; not necessarily\r\nthe only one, but very often in that one only. Thus there were certain\r\ntowns for the carrying on of the wool industry; you could only trade\r\nin wool in those towns. The word \"staple,\" from meaning the town or\r\nmarket, got applied by an easy process to the commodity dealt in; so\r\nthat when we now say that the Vermont staple is hay, we mean that this\r\nis the main crop raised in Vermont. But the staple--like the modern\r\nstockyard or exchange--tended to monopoly and was abolished for this\r\nreason.\r\n\r\nIn 1340 and 1344 we find two picturesque statutes showing how the\r\nEnglish were getting jealous of the Norman kings: \"The realm and\r\npeople of England shall not be subject to the King or people of\r\nFrance\"--that is, that the customs and law of France, although their\r\nkings were French, were not to be applied to England. Then in the\r\nroyal edict that year when King Edward assumed the title, King of\r\nFrance, they caused him to put in a statement that no inference was to\r\nbe drawn from his assuming the flower de luces in the first quarter\r\nof his arms. The present English coat of arms is modern; instead of\r\nhaving the Norman leopards in the upper right hand and lower left\r\nhand, they then had the blue field and the fleurs de lys of France in\r\nthe upper, and the Norman leopards only in the lower corner; and this\r\nlasted until the time of Charles I. In that part of Normandy which now\r\nstill remains to the English crown, that is, in Guernsey and Jersey,\r\nyou find to-day that only the leopards, not the arms of Great Britain,\r\nare in use. But then again, in 1344, we have a statute (which, by the\r\nway, itself is written in French) complaining that the French king is\r\ntrying to destroy the English language. They were getting very jealous\r\nof anything French; the Normans had already been absorbed; modern\r\nEngland was beginning to appear.\r\n\r\n(1344) And now comes a liberal statute, repealing those restrictions\r\non wool, and allowing it to be exported; and another statute that \"the\r\nSea be open to all manner of merchants.\" Now this is the origin of the\r\ngreat English notion of freedom to trade with foreign parts; and was\r\nprincipally relied upon three centuries later in the great case of\r\nmonopoly (7 State Trials) brought against the East India Company. And\r\nEngland has assumed dominion of the sea ever since; \"the boundaries of\r\nGreat Britain are the high-water mark upon every other country.\"\r\n\r\n(1348) This year was the plague of the Black Death, and the following\r\nyear is the first Statute of Laborers discussed in an earlier chapter\r\nand elaborately amended in the following year. In 1350 also we find\r\nthe Statute of Cloths, providing again for free trade in victuals,\r\ncloths, and any other manner of merchandise in all the towns and ports\r\nof England, and punishing forestalling of any merchandise with two\r\nyears' imprisonment and forfeiture of the goods, one-half to go to the\r\ninformer. Two years later the forestalling and engrossing of Gascony\r\nwines is forbidden and even the selling of them at an advanced price,\r\nand this offence is made capital!--and the next year we have the most\r\nelaborate of the Statutes of the Staple re-established. This ordinance\r\n(1353) provides for a staple of wools, leather, wool fells, and\r\nlead in various towns in England, Wales, and Ireland. The safety of\r\nmerchant strangers is provided for, and it is again made a felony for\r\nthe king's subjects to export wool; and more important still, all\r\nmerchants coming to the staple and matters therein \"shall be ruled by\r\nthe Law-Merchant and not by the common Law of the Land nor by Usage\r\nof Cities, Boroughs or other Towns,\" and any plaintiff is given the\r\noption whether he will sue his action or quarrel before the justices\r\nof the staple by the law thereof, or in the common-law court.\r\nMerchandise may be sold in gross or by parcels, but may not be\r\nforestalled; and the goods of strangers suffering shipwreck shall be\r\nrestored to their owners on payment of salvage. Houses in staple towns\r\nmust be let at a reasonable rate, and conspiracies or combinations\r\nagainst the law of the staple made criminal. Again our ancestors\r\nshowed themselves more civilized than we, this time in their\r\nCustom-house proceedings; for Article 26 of this statute provides that\r\n\"whereas a Duty is payable of three pence in the pound by all merchant\r\nstrangers coming into the kingdom, they may show their letters or\r\ninvoices to prove the value of their goods, and if they have no\r\nletters, they shall be believed by their oath ... and now of late we\r\nunderstand by the Complaint of the said Merchants that although they\r\nhave Letters or have made oath, nevertheless after the Oath made the\r\nbailiffs of the customs do unseal their Barrels, Fardels, and Bales\r\nfor which they have taken their oath. We, not willing that Strangers\r\nthat come into our Realm be in such Manner grieved, establish that\r\nwhen the Letters or the oath be taken their Goods shall be delivered\r\nto them without delay and the bailiffs meddle no more of the same\r\nGoods upon Pain of Imprisonment and pay the Party grieved quatreple\r\nDamages.\" As is well known, it is the United States custom to insist\r\nupon the oath of the importer, and notwithstanding that, rummage open\r\nhis trunks. Or are we to infer that people were more truthful in those\r\ndays?\r\n\r\n(1354) The export of iron is forbidden, and the justices given power\r\nto punish them that sell iron at too dear a price, but it does not\r\nappear how the prices are to be determined; and the Statute of the\r\nStaple is again re-enacted and the provision made that duty shall be\r\npaid only upon those goods which are actually sold in England and the\r\nmerchant may re-export the balance--the first precedent of our laws\r\nof importing under bond. It is notable that this year the Statute of\r\nLaborers is extended to the city of London.\r\n\r\n(1357) The Ordinance of Herrings is a most interesting example of\r\nearly intelligence in dealing with a modern abuse. It provides \"that\r\nno herring shall be bought or sold in the Sea, till the Fishers be\r\ncome into the Haven with their Herring, and that the Cable of the Ship\r\nbe drawn to the Land.\" That thereupon they may sell freely, but only\r\nbetween sunrise and sunset. \"The Hundred of Herring shall be ... six\r\nscore, and the Last by ten Thousand and all Merchants must sell the\r\nThousand of Herring after the Rate of the Price of the Last, and the\r\npeople of Yarmouth shall sell the last [that is, the ten thousand red\r\nherring], bought for forty shillings for half a mark of gain and not\r\nabove; and so the people of London for one mark of gain\"; and the\r\ndestruction of fish is prevented, but all caught must be sold. It is\r\nwell known that the custom was to destroy all the fish brought into\r\nBillingsgate market above a certain quantity, which led Ruskin to cry\r\nout furiously that the real prices of the world were regulated by\r\nRascals, while the fools are bleating their folly of Supply and\r\nDemand. One may guess to-day that most of the proceedings in the ports\r\nof Boston, New York, or Gloucester would be highly criminal under this\r\nancient law. So, in the Statute of Dogger (this ancient word meaning\r\nthe ships that carry fish for salting to Blakeney, Cromer, and other\r\nports in the east of England), the price of dogger fish is settled at\r\nthe beginning of the day and must be sold at such price \"openly, and\r\nnot by covin, or privily,\" nor can fish be bought for resale, but must\r\nbe sold within the bounds of the market. To-day there is not a quart\r\nof milk that goes into Boston that is not forestalled, nor possibly\r\na fish that is not sold at sea or even before its capture; and\r\nthe number of middlemen is many--when, indeed, they all are not\r\nconsolidated into a trust. The destruction, directly or by cold\r\nstorage, of milk, fish, eggs, or other food in order solely to\r\nmaintain the price should to-day be a misdemeanor; and these early\r\ndoctrines of forestalling and restraining trade should be to-day more\r\nintelligently applied by our judges--or by the legislatures, if our\r\nlawyers have forgotten them--for they all are \"highly criminal at the\r\ncommon law.\"\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Edward III appears one of many cruel ordinances for\r\nIreland. Although the Roman Church was then, of course, universal, the\r\nstatute is addressed to \"the Archbishops, Bishops, Abbots, Priors and\r\nour Officers both great and small of our land of Ireland,\" and\r\nrecites that \"through default of good government and the neglect\r\nand carelessness of the royal officers there [this is probably true\r\nenough] our land of Ireland and the Clergy and People thereof have\r\nbeen manifoldly disturbed and grieved; and the Marches of said Land\r\nsituate near the Enemy, laid waste by Hostile Invasions, the Marches\r\nbeing slain and plundered and their Dwellings horribly burnt.\" The\r\nMarchers were, of course, mainly of English descent; and one notes\r\nthat the Irish are frankly termed the Enemy. As a method of meeting\r\nthis evil, the Saxon intelligence of the day could find no better\r\nremedy than to lay it to \"marriages and divers other Ties and the\r\nnursing of Infant Children among the English and the Irish, and\r\nForewarnings and Espyals made on both Sides by the Occasions\r\naforesaid,\" and it therefore forbids such marriages to be contracted\r\nbetween English and Irish, \"and other private Ties and nursing of\r\nInfant Children.\" The statute notes that these dissensions do not\r\noccur only between the English and those of Irish blood, but as well\r\nbetween the English of birth and the English of descent living in\r\nIreland; a condition which has, indeed, continued till to-day, Parneil\r\nand a host of famous Irishmen being of pure English descent.\r\n\r\nIn 1360 the exportation of corn is forbidden. We now, therefore, have\r\nthat principle applied to wool, iron, and bread-stuffs--corn, of\r\ncourse, meaning all kinds of grain. There is another statute requiring\r\nParliament to be held once a year; and, more interesting, that pleas\r\nshould be made in the English language, for \"the French tongue is\r\nmuch unknown in said Realm of England,\" but the judgments are to be\r\nenrolled in Latin. In 1363 another statute concerning diet and apparel\r\nfixes the price of poultry, a young capon three pence, an old one four\r\npence, a hen two pence, and a pullet one penny \"for the great Dearth\r\nthat is in many Places.\" Department stores are anticipated by a clause\r\ncomplaining that the merchants called grocers do engross all manner\r\nof merchandise \"by Covin and Ordinance made betwixt them, called the\r\nFraternity and Gild of Merchants,\" and anticipates the prejudice\r\nagainst the modern department store by ordaining that merchants shall\r\ndeal in only one sort of merchandise; and furthermore handicraftsmen\r\nare allowed to \"use only one Mystery,\" that is, trade--which also\r\nanticipates a principle dear to modern trades-unions. The statute then\r\nregulates the diet and apparel of servants. They may eat once a day of\r\nflesh or fish, but the rest of their diet must be milk or vegetarian.\r\nTheir clothing may not exceed two marks in value. People of handicraft\r\nand yeomen, however, are allowed to wear clothing worth forty\r\nshillings, but not silk, silver, nor precious stones. Squires and\r\ngentlemen of a landed estate less than one hundred pounds a year may\r\nwear clothing to the value of four marks and a half, but not gold nor\r\nsilver, precious stones nor fur. Merchants having goods to the value\r\nof five hundred pounds may dress like esquires and gentlemen to a\r\nvalue of six marks. Clerks, that is to say, persons having degrees\r\nfrom colleges, may dress like knights of the same income and may\r\nwear fur in winter and lawn in summer, and clothiers make clothes\r\naccordingly and drapers and tailors charge proportionately. This most\r\ninteresting effort to interfere with private life stops short of\r\nregulating the use of wine or beer; and tobacco had not yet been\r\ndiscovered. It is all the more interesting to note that it was found\r\nso intolerable that it was repealed the following year; and little\r\neffort since then has been made to regulate the diet or dress or\r\nexpenditure of Englishmen; it was declared in memorable language that\r\n\"which was ordained at the last Parliament, of Living and of Apparel,\r\nand that no English Merchant should use but one Merchandise\" be\r\nrepealed, and \"It is ordained, That all People shall be as free as\r\nthey were before the said Ordinance,\" and \"all Merchants, as well\r\nAliens as Denizens, may sell and buy all Manner of Merchandises, and\r\nfreely carry them out of the Realm ... saving the Victuallers of Fish\r\nthat fish for Herring and other Fish, and they that bring Fish within\r\nthe Realm.\" Thus, after trying the opposite, we find triumphantly\r\nestablished in the middle of the fourteenth century the great English\r\nprinciple of freedom of life and trade. The legislation of this great\r\nreign ends with the prohibition of practising lawyers from sitting in\r\nParliament and an ordinance that women might not practise law or \"sue\r\nin court by way of Maintenance or Reward, especially Alice Perrens,\"\r\nAlice Perrers or Pierce having become unpopular as the mistress of the\r\nelderly king. Our courts have usually held that there is no common-law\r\nprinciple forbidding women to practise law, but from this ancient\r\nstatute it would appear that such decisions are erroneous.\r\n\r\n(1381) In 5 Richard II is a law absolutely forbidding the sale of\r\nsweet wines at retail. This law, with the testimony of Shakespeare,\r\ngoes to show that England liked their wines dry (sack), but the act is\r\nrepealed the following year, only that sweet wines must be sold at\r\nthe same price as the wines of the Rhine and Gascony; and in the same\r\nyear, more intelligent than we, is a statute permitting merchants to\r\nship goods in foreign ships when no English ships are to be had. In\r\n1383, according to Spence, the barons protested that they would never\r\nsuffer the kingdom to be governed by the Roman law, and the judges\r\nprohibited it from being any longer cited in the common-law tribunals.\r\nThe rest of the statutes of Richard II are taken up with the important\r\nstatutes concerning riots and forcible entries, and regulating labor,\r\nas set forth in the last chapter.\r\n\r\nThe troublesome reign of Richard II closes with an interesting attempt\r\nto make its legislation permanent, as has sometimes been attempted\r\nin our State constitutions. The last section of the last law of King\r\nRichard declares \"That the King by the Assent of the said Lords and\r\nKnights [note it does not say by consent of the Commons], so assigned\r\nby the said Authority of Parliament, will and hath ordained that ...\r\nto repeal or to attempt the repeal of any of the said Statutes\r\nis declared to be high treason,\" and the man so doing shall have\r\nexecution as a traitor. Notwithstanding, in the following year the\r\nfirst act of Henry IV repeals the whole Parliament of the 21st of\r\nRichard II and all their statutes; that it be \"wholly reversed,\r\nrevoked, voided, undone, repealed, and adnulled for ever\"--so we with\r\nthe States in rebellion, and so Charles II with the acts of Cromwell.\r\n\r\n(1400) Under Henry IV is the first secular law against heresy, making\r\nit a capital offence. Upon conviction by the ordinary the heretic\r\nis to be delivered to the secular arm, _i.e._, burnt. Note that the\r\ntrial, however, still remains with the ordinary, _i.e._, the clerical\r\ncourt. Under Henry IV also we find a statute banishing all Welshmen\r\nand forbidding them to buy land or become freemen in England; and\r\nunder Henry VI the same law is applied to Irishmen, and in the next\r\nreign to Scotchmen as well. The Irishmen complained of, however,\r\nwere only those attending the University of Oxford. In 1402 we find\r\nParliament asserting its right to ratify treaties and to be consulted\r\non wars; matters not without interest to President Roosevelt's\r\nCongress, and in 1407 we find definite recognition of the principle\r\nthat money bills must originate in the lower house.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of his Chicago speech, it is a pity that Mr. Bryan's\r\nattention was never called to the Statute of the 8th of Henry VI,\r\nwhich forbids merchants from compelling payment in gold and from\r\nrefusing silver, \"which Gold they do carry out of the Realm into\r\nother strange Countries.\" An enlightened civic spirit is shown in the\r\nStatute of 1433, which prohibits any person dwelling at the Stews in\r\nSouthwark from serving on juries in Surrey, whereby \"many Murderers\r\nand notorious Thieves have been saved, great Murders and Robberies\r\nconcealed and not punished.\" And the statute sweepingly declares\r\neverybody inhabiting that part of Southwark to be thieves, common\r\nwomen, and other misdoers. Fortunately, this was before the time that\r\nJohn Harvard took up his residence there.\r\n\r\nIn 1430 was the first statute imposing a property qualification upon\r\nvoters.\r\n\r\nIn 1452 is a curious statute reciting that \"Whereas in all Parts\r\nof this Realm divers People of great Power, moved with unsatiable\r\nCovetousness ... have sought and found new Inventions, and them\r\ncontinually do execute, to the Danger, Trouble and great abusing of\r\nall Ladies, Gentlewomen, and having any Substance ... perceiving their\r\ngreat Weakness and Simplicity, will take them by Force, or otherwise\r\ncome to them seeming to be their great Friends ... and so by great\r\nDissimulation ... get them into their Possession; also they will\r\nmany Times compell them to be married by them, contrary to their own\r\nliking.\" A writ of chancery is given to persons so constrained of\r\ntheir liberty to summon the person complained of, and if he make\r\ndefault be outlawed--an early example of \"government by injunction\"\r\napplied to other than labor disputes! I know no example of an American\r\nstatute to this effect; presumably our women are lacking in \"weakness\r\nand simplicity.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1463 is another curious sumptuary law prescribing with great care\r\nthe apparel of knights, bachelors, gentlemen and their wives, making\r\nit criminal for tailors to make cloths not according to this fashion,\r\nand for shoemakers to make boots or shoes having pikes more than two\r\ninches long. No draper shall sell or women wear hose to the value of\r\nmore than fourteen pence, nor kerchiefs worth more than ten shillings,\r\nbut scholars of the universities \"may wear such Array as they may,\"\r\nnor does the ordinance extend to judges or soldiers. The provision\r\nagainst long pikes to shoes appears to be considered of importance,\r\nfor it was re-enacted in 1464. I have searched in vain for a statute\r\nrelating to hatpins. Again in 1482 there is another long statute\r\nconcerning apparel which seems to have been considered under the reign\r\nof Edward IV quite the most important thing in life. A more manly\r\nclause of the statute is concerned with the benefits of archery to\r\nEngland, reciting that \"In the Time of the victorious Reign ... the\r\nKing's Subjects have virtuously occupied and used shooting with their\r\nBows, whereby and under the Protection of Almighty God, victorious\r\nacts have been done in Defence of this Realm,\" and the price of long\r\nbows of yew is limited to three and four pence. The statutes now begin\r\nto be in English.\r\n\r\nIn 1488 the Isle of Wight is to be repeopled with English people for\r\n\"defence of the King's auncien ennemyes of the realme of Fraunce.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1491 all Scots are to depart the realm within forty days upon pain\r\nof forfeiture of all their goods; it is not recorded that any remained\r\nin England. In 1491 Henry VII levied an amazingly heavy tax upon\r\npersonal property, that is to say, two fifteenths and tenths upon all\r\n\"movable goodes cattales and othre thinges usuelly to suche xvmes and\r\nxmes contributory,\" with the exception of Cambridge and a few other\r\nfavored towns. In 1495 the famous Oklahoma statute is anticipated by a\r\nlaw regulating abuses in the stuffing of feather beds.\r\n\r\nIn 1503 a statute recites that the \"Longe Bowes hathe ben moche used\r\nin this his Realme, wherby Honour & Victorie hathe ben goten ... and\r\nmoche more drede amonge all Cristen Princes by reasone of the same,\r\nwhiche shotyng is now greatly dekayed.\" So this mediaeval Kipling\r\nlaments that they now delight in cross-bows to the great hurt and\r\nenfeebling of the Realm and to the comfort of outward enemies,\r\nwherefore cross-bows are forbidden except to the lords, on penalty of\r\nforfeiture of the bow.\r\n\r\n(1509) The reign of Henry VIII was one of personal government; and\r\nin those days personal government resulted in a small output of\r\nlaw-making by Parliament. Indeed, after 1523, under Cardinal Wolsey,\r\nParliament was not summoned for seven years. In 1539 the attempt to do\r\nwithout popular legislation is shown in the act already referred to,\r\ngiving royal proclamations of the king and council the force of law, a\r\ndefinite attempt at personal government which might have resulted in\r\nthe establishment of an administrative law fashioned by the executive,\r\nhad it not been for the sturdy opposition of the people under weaker\r\nreigns. But under the reign of Henry VIII also the great right of free\r\nspeech in Parliament was established; and in 1514 the king manumitted\r\ntwo villeins with the significant words \"Whereas God created all\r\nmen free,\" vulgarly supposed to be original with our Declaration of\r\nIndependence.\r\n\r\nThe important principle of a limitation for prosecutions by the\r\ngovernment for penal offences dates from the first year of Henry\r\nVIII, the period being put, as it still is, at three years; and it is\r\nexpressed to be for better peace and justice and to avoid the taking\r\nup of old charges after the evidence has disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn 1515 is another act of apparel providing, among other things, that\r\nthe king only shall wear cloth-of-gold or purple color, or black\r\nfur, and that no man under the degree of a knight may wear \"pinched\r\nShirts.\" In this reign also comes the famous Statute of Wills,\r\npermitting the disposal of land by devise, the Statute of Uses\r\nand other matters primarily of interest to the lawyer; the first\r\nBankruptcy Act and the first legislation recognizing the duty of the\r\nsecular law to support the poor, perfected only under Queen Elizabeth;\r\nbut in the latter part of his reign there is little law-making that\r\nneed concern us. The Statutes of Apparel continue, and the statutes\r\nfixing the price of wine, which, indeed, seems to have been the last\r\nsubject so regulated. There is the \"Bloody Statute\" against heresy,\r\nand the first act against witchcraft, Tindale's translation of the\r\nBible is prohibited, and women and laborers forbidden to read the New\r\nTestament. There is the first act for the preservation of the river\r\nThames, and also for the cleaning of the river at Canterbury; and the\r\nfirst game law protecting wild-fowl, and a law \"for the breeding of\r\nhorses\" to be over fifteen hands. The king is allowed to make bishops\r\nand dissolve monasteries; physicians are required to be licensed. The\r\nregrating of wools and fish is again forbidden, and finally there is\r\nan act for the true making of Pynnes; that is to say, they are to be\r\ndouble headed and the heads \"soudered fast to the Shanke.\"\r\n\r\nWe are now approaching the end of our task, for the legislation after\r\nJames I, with the exception of a few great acts, such as the Statute\r\nof Frauds and the Habeas Corpus Act, hardly concerns us as not being\r\npart of our inherited common law. The reigns of Elizabeth and James\r\nare to us principally notable for the increase of the feeling against\r\nmonopolies, ending in the great Statute of James I. While we still\r\nfind restrictions upon trade in market towns or in the city of\r\nLondon, they always appear as local restrictions and are usually soon\r\nrepealed. The prejudice against regrating, that is to say, middlemen,\r\ncontinues, as is shown in a Statute of Edward VI, providing that no\r\none shall buy butter or cheese unless to sell the same only by retail\r\nin open shop. That is to say, there must be no middleman between the\r\nproducer and the retailer, and a definition of the word \"retail\" is\r\ngiven. In 1552, the 7th of Edward VI is a celebrated statute called\r\nthe Assize of Fuel, applied to the city of London, notable because\r\nit forbids middlemen and provides that no one shall buy wood or coal\r\nexcept such as will burn or consume the same, \"Forasmuche as by the\r\ngredye appetite and coveteousnes of divers persons, Fuell Coles and\r\nWoodd runethe many times throughe foure or fyve severall handes or\r\nmoe before it comethe to thandes of them that for their necessite doo\r\nburne ... the same\"--under penalty of treble value.\r\n\r\nIn 1551 is the last elaborate act against regrators, forestallers, and\r\nengrossers, made perpetual by 13 Elizabeth, and only repealed in 1772.\r\nIt recognizes all previous laws against them, but recites that they\r\nhave not had good effect, and therefore in the first section gives a\r\nprecise definition. _Forestalling_--the buying of victuals or other\r\nmerchandise on their way to a market or port, or contracting to buy\r\nthe same before they arrive at such market or city, or making any\r\nmotion for the enhancing of the price thereof, or to prevent the\r\nsupply, that is, to induce any person coming to the market, etc., to\r\nstay away. _Regrating_ is narrowed to victuals, alive or dead, and to\r\nthe reselling them at the fair or market where they were bought or\r\nwithin four miles thereof; and _engrossing_ is given a definition very\r\nsimilar to our \"buying of futures.\" That is to say, it is the buying\r\nor contracting to buy any corn growing in the fields or any other\r\nvictuals within the Realm of England with intent to sell the same\r\nagain. The penalty for all such offences is two months' imprisonment\r\nand forfeiture of the value of the goods, but for a third offence the\r\nperson suffers forfeiture and may be imprisoned. There is an important\r\nrecognition of modern political economy made in the proviso that\r\npersons may engross corn, etc., when it sells at or below a certain\r\nprice, not, however, forestalling it.\r\n\r\nIn 1554 is a statute for the relief of weavers, prohibiting \"the\r\nengrossing of looms,\" thus anticipating one of the principal doctrines\r\nof Lassalle. In the same year, 1st of Philip and Mary, is a statute\r\nprohibiting countrymen from retailing goods in cities, boroughs, or\r\nmarket towns, but selling by wholesale is allowed, and they may sell\r\nif free of a corporation; and so cloth may be retailed by the\r\nmaker, and the statute only applies to cloth and grocery wares, not\r\napparently to food.\r\n\r\n(1562) From the reign of Elizabeth dates the great Poor Law, enacted\r\nand re-enacted in 1562, 1572, and finally in 1601, recognizing fully\r\nthe duty of the parishes to support their poor, but providing a system\r\nof organized charity and even licensing beggars in towns too poor to\r\nsupport all their paupers. Side by side with this, however, went the\r\nsevere statutes against idlers and vagabonds recited in the last\r\nchapter. The first game laws date from about this period, prohibiting\r\nthe snaring of birds and establishing close seasons, and also in 1584\r\nwe find the first forestry law for the preservation of timber in the\r\nsouthern counties. There is no provision for seeding, but the use in\r\nthe iron works of wood for fuel is carefully regulated, and in order\r\nto preserve the forests in Sussex, Surrey, and Kent, it is provided\r\nthat no new iron mills, furnaces, etc., shall be erected in those\r\ncounties, showing the relative value that our forefathers placed upon\r\nthese matters. The first incorporation of a trading company seems\r\nalso to date from the time of Elizabeth. That is to say, the Muscovy\r\nCompany was chartered in 1564, and the Merchant Adventurers for the\r\ndiscovery of new trades in 1566. In this same year is the celebrated\r\nact of Speaker Onslow, in telling Elizabeth that she is subject to the\r\ncommon law; from henceforward we are in modern times. In 1534 Henry\r\nVIII declared himself supreme head of the Church of England; five\r\nyears later with the dissolution of monasteries came the \"Bloody\r\nStatute,\" whereby he attempted to vindicate his orthodoxy. The act was\r\nentitled \"An Act abolishing diversity of opinion on certain articles\r\nconcerning the Christian Religion,\" and insisted upon the sacraments,\r\ncelibacy, masses, and confessions, but in 1548 the marriage of priests\r\nwas made lawful, and in 1566 the pope forbade attendance at the\r\nEnglish Church. Thus, Roman law was expelled in the first two or\r\nthree centuries after the Conquest, the Roman Church in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and it remained for the seventeenth to struggle with the\r\nlast serious attempt at the Roman or Continental theory of personal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n(1602) King James at his accession asserted the divine right, and his\r\nlegislation, other than special bills for the restoration of attainted\r\npersons, or the confirmation of titles, is scanty, his reign being\r\nprincipally occupied with the conflict with Parliament, which he\r\nforbade from meddling with affairs of state. In the first year of his\r\nreign, the Statute of Laborers of Elizabeth was confirmed, as well\r\nas that against rogues and vagabonds; the ninth act of his first\r\nParliament was \"To restraine the inordinate hauntinge and tiplinge in\r\nInnes and Alehouses,\" and, indeed, much of his legislation is aimed at\r\nwhat should properly be called \"sins\" rather than \"crimes\"; the next\r\nact after this was one to restrain \"all persons from Marriage until\r\ntheir former Wyves and former Husbandes be deade.\" And next came a\r\nstatute against witchcraft. In 1603 is an act to prohibit people from\r\neating anything but fish in Lent, entitled \"An Acte to encourage\r\nthe Seamen of England to take Fishe, wherebie they may encrease to\r\nfurnishe the Navie of England.\" There was an act for the relief of\r\nskinners, and a charter given by Queen Elizabeth in the twenty-first\r\nyear of her reign to the Eastland merchants for a monopoly of trade in\r\nthose countries; it would be interesting could these early corporation\r\ncharters and monopoly grants be printed, for they are not usually\r\nfound in the statutes of the realm. In 1605 stage players are\r\nforbidden from swearing on the stage. In 1606 is an elaborate act for\r\nthe regulation of the spinning, weaving, dyeing, and width of woollen\r\ncloth, and the same year is an act for \"repressinge the odious and\r\nloathsome synne of Drunckennes,\" imposing a penalty or fine and the\r\nstocks. In 1609 an act of Edward IV is revived, forbidding the sale of\r\nEnglish horns unwrought, that people of strange lands do come in and\r\ncarry the same over the sea and there work them, one of the latest\r\nstatutes against the export of raw material. In the last year of his\r\nreign comes the great Statute of Monopolies noted in the last chapter,\r\nand an act extending the benefit of clergy to women convicted of small\r\nfelonies, for which they had previously suffered death, and another\r\nact for the repression of drunkenness. And the last statute we shall\r\nnote, like the first, is concerned with regrating and engrossing;\r\nthat is to say, it re-enacts the Statute of Edward VI prohibiting\r\nthe engrossing of butter and cheese, and prohibiting middlemen. Thus\r\nrestraint of trade and freedom of labor begin and end as the most\r\nusual subjects of English popular law-making.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words upon Cromwell's legislation may be of interest; for though\r\nit was all repealed and left no vestige in the laws of England, it had\r\nsome effect upon the legislation of Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and\r\nConnecticut. Under the Commonwealth there was but one legislative\r\nchamber, and over that the protector exercised far more control than\r\nhad been ventured by the maddest Stuart or Tudor. One would suppose\r\nthat a period which represented the supremacy of the common people\r\nwould be marked by a mass of popular legislation. Quite the contrary\r\nis the fact. In the first place, the Instrument of Government,\r\nprepared by the so-called Barebones Parliament, was supposed to be a\r\nsort of constitution; as a symbol of the change from absolute personal\r\ngovernment to constitutional government under this Instrument,\r\nCromwell exchanged his military sword for the civil common sword\r\ncarried by General Lambert, who was at the head of the deputation\r\npraying the Lord General to accept the office of protector. It vested\r\nthe supreme power in him, acting with the advice of the Council, with\r\nwhose consent alone he could make war, and that Council was to choose\r\nfuture protectors. The legislative power resided in a single chamber,\r\nupon which he had a veto. There was an ordinary property qualification\r\nfor voting, and religious liberty was guaranteed, except as to the\r\npapists. Only one Parliament, as a matter of fact, assembled under\r\nthis Instrument of Government, and the very first legislative function\r\nit endeavored to exercise seemed to offend Cromwell, who promptly\r\ndissolved it with a file of soldiers. That was the end of\r\nconstitutional government under the protector. The laws of the Rump\r\nParliament, and the Barebones Parliament, are entirely omitted from\r\nthe official Statutes of England, and only to be found in a rather\r\nrare volume. They mostly concern military affairs. The real reforms of\r\ngovernment, like the abolition of the Star Chamber and feudal tenures,\r\nhad in fact been carried out under Charles I.\r\n\r\nA further word should be given to the origin of the business\r\ncorporation, an almost accidental event, which has affected the world\r\nof trade and affairs more than the invention of printing, of the\r\nbill of exchange, and the Law Merchant combined. It would have been\r\nperfectly possible for the world to get on and do business without\r\nthe modern corporation--without the invention of a fictitious person\r\nclothed with the enormously powerful attributes of immortality\r\nand irresponsibility. That is to say, men can act together or in\r\npartnership, but they are mortal, and at their death their personal\r\npowers end. The corporation may be immortal, and its powers, as well\r\nas its acquisitions, increase forever. Men are liable with all their\r\nestates for their contracts and obligations. Men in corporations are\r\nonly liable to the amount of their aliquot share of stock, or often\r\nnot at all. Corporations may dissolve, and be reborn, divide, and\r\nreunite, swallow up other corporations or often other persons.\r\nIndividuals cannot do so except by the easily broken bond of\r\nco-partnership.\r\n\r\nTrading corporations for profit were _practically_ unknown to the\r\nRomans, or even to Continental countries--scholastic precedents\r\nand the Venetian _commendam_ to the contrary notwithstanding. They\r\ndeveloped in England first out of the guild or out of the monastery;\r\nbut the religious corporation, although regarded with great jealousy\r\nin the Statutes against Mortmain, which show that from the earliest\r\ntimes our ancestors feared the attribute of immortality that\r\ncharacterizes the corporation, have never had the principle of\r\nlimited, or no, personal liability. That, indeed, is said to have been\r\ninvented by the State of Connecticut (see below, chapter 10). They\r\nwere, however, often clothed with monopoly. In 1643 we find the\r\nFellowship of Merchant Adventurers of England, a business corporation,\r\nwith power to levy money on the members, and exclusive powers to trade\r\nin its own products, which seem to have been clothing and woollen\r\nmanufactures. We have already mentioned the earlier charter to the\r\nEastland merchants. Mr. James Bryce has pointed out to me that the\r\nobjection of monopoly would not have been felt so much to apply to a\r\ncorporation chartered only for purposes of trade out of England. It\r\nwould seem, therefore, that the invention and growth of the secular\r\ncorporation was an accident of the legislation of Queen Elizabeth's\r\ntime; and arose rather from this desire to get a monopoly, than from\r\nany conscious copying of the trade guilds, still less the religious\r\ncorporations of earlier dates; for the trade guilds were nothing but\r\na more or less voluntary association of men bound together in a very\r\nindefinite bond, hardly more of a permanent effective body than any\r\nchanging group of men, such as a political party is, from year to\r\nyear; the only bond between them being that they happen at some\r\nparticular time to exercise a certain claim at a certain place; and\r\neven the trade guilds, as we know, had somewhat the course of a modern\r\ncorporation. They became overgrown, aristocratic, swollen in fortune,\r\nand monopolistic in tendency. To some extent in the English cities and\r\ntowns, and still more in France, they became tyrannous. And in the\r\nprevious reign of Henry VIII all religious corporations had been\r\ndissolved.\r\n\r\nNot much, perhaps, remained for Cromwell's Parliament to do. The\r\nabuses of law-making, of the Star Chamber, and other non-common-law\r\ncourts, of personal government, had been swept away under Charles I.\r\nIn 1644 the Book of Common Prayer was abolished. In 1646 the bishops\r\nwere abolished, in 1648 the king and the House of Peers, and in 1649\r\nthe king was beheaded. Cromwell's Parliament was more interested\r\nin the raising of money and the dividing up royal lands than in\r\nconstructive legislation. They did find time to forbid the planting\r\nof tobacco in England, and to pass an act furthering the religion of\r\nJesus Christ in New England; also a society for the foundation of the\r\ngospel in New England, with power to raise money or make collections\r\nfor that purpose, provided always, they did not carry any gold,\r\nsilver, plate, or money outside of England. An act claiming that \"the\r\nIndians are renouncing their heathen sorceries and betaking themselves\r\nto English schools and universities,\" possibly refers to one Indian\r\ngraduate of Harvard, Caleb Cheeshahteaumuck, of the class of 1665.\r\nThere are statutes concerning the impressing of seamen; a bankruptcy\r\nact, a statute authorizing secular marriage without a priest or church\r\nceremony, and the act for preferring veterans in the Spanish War in\r\ncivil service, a statute which gives a respectable antiquity to our\r\nlaws making a privileged class of veterans or the descendants of\r\nveterans of the Civil and Spanish Wars. Under Cromwell they could\r\nexercise any trade without apprenticeship; a recent South Carolinian\r\nstatute providing that Confederate veterans could exercise any trade\r\nwithout paying the usual license tax was held unconstitutional by the\r\nSupreme Court of South Carolina itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nAMERICAN LEGISLATION IN GENERAL\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore approaching the actual field of American legislation, it may be\r\nwise to make a few general statements concerning it. It was some fifty\r\nyears after the adoption of the Federal Constitution before it began\r\nin great bulk, but to-day we find in the States alone forty-six\r\nlegislative bodies, and two of Territories, besides the Federal\r\nCongress and the limited legislatures of our insular possessions.\r\nNearly all of these turn out laws every year; even when the\r\nlegislatures meet biennially, they frequently have an annual session.\r\nOnly in one or two Southern States have recent constitutions\r\nrestricted them to once in four years. It would be a fair estimate\r\nthat they average five hundred statutes a year, which would make,\r\nroughly speaking, twenty-five thousand annual laws. It has been well\r\ndoubted by students of modern democracy, by Lecky and Carlyle, if this\r\nimmense mass of legislation is a benefit at all. Carlyle, indeed, is\r\nrecorded to have taken Emerson down to the House of Commons and showed\r\nhim that legislative body in full function, only taking him away when\r\nhe was sufficiently exhausted, with the query whether Emerson, though\r\na Unitarian, did not now believe in a personal devil. Administrative\r\nlaw-making for the machinery of government there must always be, but\r\nfor the rest, if we rely on the common law and its natural development\r\nalone, our condition will be far less hopeless than most of us might\r\nimagine. Indeed, as we shall so often find, it is the very ease and\r\nfrequency of legislation that has caused our courts and law-makers\r\nto forego the well-tried doctrines of the common law. Many of our\r\nstatutes but re-enact it; when they go beyond it, it is frequently to\r\nblunder. Moreover, it is a commonplace that no law is successful that\r\ndoes not fairly express the thought and customs, the conditions, of\r\nthe mass of the people. Professor Jenks of Oxford applies to all other\r\nlegislation the term \"fancy legislation,\" or, as we might say, freak\r\nlegislation--the caprices and desires of the present legislature or\r\ntheir constituents, carried immediately into law; and we may say at\r\nthe outset that such legislation has rarely proved wise, and\r\nhardly ever effective. It is needless to state that many modern\r\nstatutes--like prohibition laws, for instance--are passed for that\r\nvery reason. Yet whatever the fact may have been in the past, there is\r\nno doubt that for the future, legislation by the people, constructive\r\nlaw-making at the popular behest, is the great new fact of\r\nAnglo-American civilization. There has just been brought out an\r\nimmense index, under the auspices of the British Government, called\r\n\"The Legislation of the Empire, being a Survey of the Legislative\r\nEnactments of the British Dominions, from 1897 to 1907.\" This\r\nwork fills four huge volumes, and gives but the briefest possible\r\nindex-headings of the statutes of the British Empire for that period.\r\nOur excellent \"Index of Legislation,\" published by the New York State\r\nLibrary, contains about six hundred pages, and even this is hardly\r\nmore than an index, as the title suggests.\r\n\r\nNow, this tremendous increase in legislative output, most notable in\r\nthe States of the United States, did not begin with us at once. For\r\nsome forty or fifty years after the Revolution our State legislatures\r\nmade as little constructive legislation as did the Parliament of\r\nGeorge III. It was with the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury that the great increase began. It seems to have taken\r\ndemocratic legislatures some fifty years to become conscious that they\r\nhad this new unlimited power, and not only that they possessed it but\r\nwere expected to exercise it; the power of making absolutely new laws,\r\nstatutes which did not exist before as law, either by the common law\r\nor by the custom of the people. It is true, our ancestors had some\r\ntaste of radical legislation during the Revolution, and the checks of\r\nthe State constitutions were adopted for that reason; but subject only\r\nto this limitation, it was the first modern experiment in popular\r\nlegislation. The great wave of radical law-making that began with the\r\nmoral movements--the prohibition movement, the anti-slavery movement,\r\nand the women's rights movement--of the second quarter of the\r\nnineteenth century, lasted down until the Civil War. After that\r\nthere was a conservative reaction, followed by a new radical wave in\r\nreconstruction times, which ended with another conservative reaction\r\nat the time of the first election of President Cleveland. Since then,\r\nnew moral or social movements, mainly those concerned with the desire\r\nto benefit labor and repress the trusts, with the desire to protect\r\nwomen and children, seem to have brought up a new radical wave, the\r\nprogress of which has hardly ended yet. Before the Civil War, the\r\nwomen's rights movement and the anti-slavery movement always worked\r\ntogether. They were in great part composed of the same persons. In\r\nfact, the historical origin of the women's suffrage movement was a\r\nlarge abolition meeting held in England, but attended by many women\r\ndelegates from America, where they excluded a leading American woman\r\nabolitionist and would only allow her husband to take her seat in her\r\nplace. We shall, of course, consider this precise question later, and\r\npause now merely to note the fact that with the anti-slavery movement,\r\nending with the adoption of the war amendments and the women's\r\nsuffrage movement, ceasing to progress soon after, there came the\r\nperiod of conservative reaction, or, at least, of quiescence, which\r\nlasted down to the recent labor and social movements that have caused\r\nour increasing mass of constructive legislation in the last few years.\r\nIt is true that some of the far Western Territories adopted women's\r\nsuffrage soon after being made States, or at the time they were\r\nadmitted; but no other State, even of those surrounding them, has\r\nfollowed their example, though the people have repeatedly voted on the\r\npoint. Whatever progress the cause may have made in England, or in the\r\nlarger cities of the East, I think that no unprejudiced observer would\r\nsay that it looks so near to accomplishment as it did in the twenty\r\nyears preceding the Civil War. Then, also, there was during the same\r\ndecades a great increase in personal property; that is to say, in\r\ncorporate stocks and bonds, the kind of property most easily attacked\r\nby legislation; but the very possession of such securities by large\r\nnumbers of the people tended to make them more conservative in\r\nordinary property matters. It is in the times when you have but\r\nfarmers on the one side, as in the Shay Rebellion in Massachusetts\r\nafter the Revolution, or when the proletariat on the one side is\r\nopposed to the bourgeoisie on the other, as in certain Continental\r\ncountries, that you find radical legislation. We were fortunate in\r\nthat a large number of our citizens were thus arrayed on both sides of\r\nthe question. Property rights, of course, have been granted to women\r\nmost completely throughout the Union, but in twenty years they have\r\nmade little progress toward the vote.\r\n\r\nBlackstone says that democracy is peculiarly fitted to the making of\r\nlaws, and calls attention to the importance of legislation, with the\r\nregret that there should be no other state of life, arts, or science,\r\nin which no preliminary instruction is looked upon as requisite; but\r\nby \"democracy\" Blackstone really meant representative government,\r\nwhich still acts quite differently from the referendum and the\r\ninitiative. Democracies, he says, are usually the best calculated to\r\ndirect the end of a law. But in no sense, says Professor Jenks, was\r\nthe British Parliament the result of a democracy; while our State\r\nlegislatures during the Revolution were, indeed, democratic, and\r\npractically omnipotent, and for that very reason were promptly curbed\r\nby the State constitutions, which were adopted even before the\r\nFederal. And of late the distrust of our legislatures is shown by the\r\nmost exaggerated list of restrictions we find placed upon them in the\r\nnewer constitutions of the Southern and Western States. Another thing\r\nBlackstone oddly says, is that in legislation by the people they will\r\nshow great caution in making new laws that may interfere with their\r\nrights and liberties. Precisely the contrary is experienced. Nobody is\r\nso willing to interfere with the rights or liberties of the people\r\nas the people themselves, or their supposed representatives in the\r\nlegislature; and a body or faction of the people is far more ready and\r\nreckless to impose its will upon the others than have been the most\r\nmasterful English monarchs.\r\n\r\nThe recklessness of legislatures has two or three most evil\r\nconsequences. They pass foolish or unconstitutional laws, relying on\r\nthe governor to veto them, or the courts to declare them void--which\r\nhas the effect of shirking their responsibility and imposing unjust\r\nand obnoxious duties on the other branches of government, to which\r\nthey do not fairly belong; increases the growing disrespect for\r\nall law, and deteriorates the moral and intellectual fibre of the\r\nlegislature itself. Finally, also, it provokes that hypertrophic\r\nmodern State constitution of the South and West, which tries to bind\r\ndown future legislatures in infinite particulars, thereby again\r\ndiminishing their importance and responsibility, making it more\r\ndifficult to get able men to serve in them, and, by the frequent\r\nnecessary amendment of State constitutions, resulting in a continual\r\nreferendum, which nearly does away with representative government\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when a law is unconstitutional it should ever be only\r\nbecause it violates some great natural right of humanity, personal\r\nliberty, property, or the right to common law. When constitutions go\r\ninto details which are not substantially connected with these cardinal\r\nrights, they bring themselves into contempt, and justify the growing\r\nprejudice of our labor leaders against them. The people should\r\nbelieve, as I think they do believe under the Federal Constitution and\r\nunder the older ones of the States, that when a law is declared _no_\r\nlaw by a high court for being counter to the higher will of the\r\npeople as expressed in their permanent constitution, it is not on a\r\ntechnicality, but because some great liberty right is infringed by it.\r\nYet it is a curious thing that whereas our people only got the power\r\nto legislate by democratic assemblies freely and completely from the\r\nyear 1776, in hardly more than a hundred years after their conscious\r\npossession of that power we find a respectably strong popular movement\r\nattempting to reverse it, or, at least, to limit its field. Most of\r\nour advocates of direct legislation by the people assume that a great\r\nmass of law-making would result in practice; probably the contrary\r\nis true; the referendum would destroy more than the initiative would\r\ncreate. They would go back to a condition of things which, in theory\r\nat least, existed in the England of the early Saxon times; although,\r\nof course, in those days only the freemen, and no women, had the\r\nlaw-making vote. Anyhow, it is curious that that representative\r\ngovernment upon which we have been priding ourselves as the one great\r\nAnglo-Saxon political invention should be precisely the thing that we\r\nare now urged to give up. In the _Federalist_ there is much discussion\r\nas to whether it is possible to have so big a democracy as the United\r\nStates, and the answer made by Hamilton was; \"Yes, because we shall\r\nhave representative government.\" But detailed discussion of the\r\ninitiative we must leave for a later chapter.\r\n\r\nPerhaps we begin to detect the prejudice in the general mind, which is\r\nnotable in the works of a few earlier theorists, to prefer statute law\r\nto what is known as judge-made law, on that ground alone. The writer\r\nis not of the school that admits there is such a thing as judge-made\r\nlaw, but believes the phrase to be a misnomer, at least in ninety-nine\r\ncases out of a hundred. The whole theory of the English law is that\r\nit exists in and by the people and is known of them before it is\r\nannounced by a judge, and although the extreme of this theory be\r\nsomewhat metaphysical, it is certainly true that a judge is a very bad\r\njudge who does not decide a point of law apparently new or doubtful\r\naccording to the entire body of English-American precedent,\r\nexperience, rather than by his own way of looking at things. If judges\r\nreally made new law, particularly if they made it consciously, it\r\nwould be more than \"aristocratic\"--it would be simply tyrannical, and,\r\nof course, be unconstitutional as well as being an interference with\r\nthe legislative branch of government. But it is doubtless this theory,\r\nthat it is the statute law that is the democratic kind, which has\r\ngiven form and body to the vast mass of statutes we are here to\r\nconsider. Certain of our legislators seem to be horrified when a court\r\napplies a precedent a hundred years old, still more when it is a\r\nthousand years old, although to the jurist, in most cases at least, if\r\nnever since questioned and never grown obsolete, it is entitled to all\r\nthe more respect for that reason. Both the labor interests and\r\nthe \"special interests\" resent excessively the recent tendency of\r\nintelligent judges to look at precedent and history. Mr. Debs will\r\ntell you that such matters are aristocratic and reactionary; Mr.\r\nRockefeller, or his lawyer, that they are both visionary and obsolete.\r\nYet a statute may only represent the sudden will of a small body of\r\nmediocre intelligence on a new subject (or an old one) which they have\r\nnever studied. It is true that if they make a mistake they can amend\r\nit to-morrow; but so, also, may be amended the decisions of the court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nAMERICAN LEGISLATION ON PROPERTY RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we come to the vast field of legislation in the United States,\r\ncomprising the law-making of forty-six States, two Territories, the\r\nNational Congress, and the Federal District, it is difficult to decide\r\nhow to divide the subject so as to make it manageable. The division\r\nmade by State codes and revisions, and the United States Revised\r\nStatutes, hardly suits our purpose, for it is made rather for lawyers\r\nthan sociologists or students in comparative legislation. The division\r\nmade by the valuable \"Year Book of Legislation,\" published by the New\r\nYork State Library, comprises some twenty subjects: Constitutional\r\nLaw; Organic Law; Citizenship and Civil Rights; Elections; Criminal\r\nLaw; Civil Law; Property and Contracts; Torts; Family; Corporations;\r\nCombinations and Monopolies; Procedure; Finance; Public Order; Health\r\nand Safety; Land and Waters; Transportation; Commerce and Industry;\r\nBanking; Insurance; Navigation and Waterways; Agriculture; Game and\r\nFish; Mines and Mining; Labor; Charities; Education; Military Matters;\r\nand Local Government. This division, however convenient in practice,\r\ncrosscuts the various fields of legislation as divided in any logical\r\nmanner. The same criticism may be applied to a somewhat simpler\r\ndivision I have used in tabulating State legislation for the last\r\ntwenty years into thirteen columns, the titles of these being, roughly\r\nspeaking, Property and Taxation; Regulation of Trades and Commercial\r\nLaw; Personal Liberty and Civil Rights; Labor; Criminal Law, Health\r\nand Morality; Government; Elections and Voting; Courts and Procedure;\r\nMilitia and Military Law; Women, Children, Marriage and Divorce;\r\nCharities, Education, Religion and Jails; Agriculture, Mining and\r\nForestry; Corporations, Trusts and Interstate Commerce. Is it not\r\npossible to begin with a broader and more simple division?\r\n\r\nNow, all statutes are limitations on a state of pure individualism,\r\ndefining this latter word to mean a state of society recognizing\r\npersonal liberty and private property, and allowing all possible\r\nfreedom of action and contract relating thereto; with a court\r\nadministration for the purpose of protecting such liberty and\r\nenforcing such contracts in the courts. The usual rough division of\r\nour constitutional rights, following the phraseology of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment, is that of life, liberty, and property; but the rights to\r\nlife and liberty obviously belong to the same broad field. Our first\r\ndivision, therefore, may well be that which divides life and liberty\r\nrights from property rights; although in some cases, notably in the\r\nearnings of labor, they would be found to run together. Liberty rights\r\nare multifarious and indefinite; we may, therefore, first take the\r\nfield of property as presenting, after all, a more simple subject.\r\nConsidering all possible organizations of human society from this\r\npoint of view, we shall find that all may be expressed, all at least\r\nthat have hitherto been conceived, under the systems of anarchism,\r\nindividualism, and socialism, these words expressing all possible\r\nstates of human society when expressed in terms of individual liberty,\r\nthat is to say, the free exercise of the individual will. Either\r\none of these may exist either with or without the notion of private\r\nproperty; though, of course, one's action as to property would be\r\ncontrolled under a system of socialism, and property itself would have\r\nno legal protection under a system of anarchism. Nevertheless, the\r\nnotion of property might still exist and be recognized by the custom\r\nof mankind without any sanction or enforcement from the entire\r\ncommunity, _i.e._, what people call the state. When we are speaking in\r\nterms of property, we use the word _communism_--meaning that state of\r\nsociety where the conception of property exists, but the law or custom\r\nwill not recognize individualism. Communism, therefore, usually\r\nimplies ownership by the entire community, while in anarchism there is\r\nno property at all. There has been much confusion in the use of these\r\nterms in the popular mind, and even in ordinary writing. Many people\r\nhave confounded, for instance, socialism with anarchism or nihilism,\r\nwhen the two things are whole poles apart. In the same manner,\r\ncommunism has been confounded with socialism, although the term should\r\nbe used in entirely different connections--communism when we are\r\nspeaking in terms of property, socialism when we are speaking in\r\nterms of individual liberty. The word _individualism_ was used by\r\nthe present writer in a series of articles entitled \"The Ethics\r\nof Democracy,\" beginning in 1887, as the most convenient term\r\nfor describing that state of society where the greatest possible\r\nindividual liberty is conjoined with a strong recognition of the right\r\nof private property, substantially the _laissez faire_ school as\r\nit existed in England in the first half of the last century; \"the\r\ndistinction between communistic and socialistic laws being, that the\r\nformer are concerned solely with the taking or redistribution of money\r\nor property; the latter regulate or prohibit men's mode of life, acts,\r\nor contracts, either among themselves or as concerning the state.\" [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Scribner's Magazine_, vol. XV, p. 653.]\r\n\r\nNow, property is but the creature of law; and that is to say, in\r\nthose of our States which have no common law, of statute. Jurists\r\nand communists are alike agreed on this. \"Property is robbery,\" said\r\nProudhon; property is but the creature of law, all English jurists\r\nadmit. It is, of course, possible to conceive of a social system which\r\nrecognizes no right of property, or one which makes all property\r\nbelong to the community, or a middle ground which admits the\r\ninstitution, but holds that every individual holds property subject\r\nto the state's, that is, the organized community's, regulation and\r\ncontrol. A convenient term for this state of affairs to which,\r\nperhaps, in our statutes, we are approaching, is \"allowable\r\n_socialism_\"; private property is recognized, but its use is\r\nregulated. In England they call it \"gas-and-water socialism\"; but this\r\nterm, though picturesque, is not sufficiently comprehensive, relating,\r\nas it does, only to municipal activities. There is a third variety,\r\nthe latest and perhaps the most intelligent of all, that believed in\r\nby leading modern German and American socialists, which we will call\r\nnationalism--the nationalization or municipalization of productive\r\nindustry--the science of this doctrine being that private property may\r\nexist in all personal belongings, articles of pleasure, or domestic\r\nnecessity, but not in lands, mines, works, or other instrumentalities\r\nused for the further production of wealth.\r\n\r\nWhatever the future may bring, we must start with the institution of\r\nprivate property recognized to its fullest extent. It is expressly\r\nguaranteed in our Federal Constitution, as for the matter of that it\r\nwas also in Magna Charta, as clearly as the right to liberty, and\r\nusually in the very same clause. Not only that, but when we adopted\r\nour first State constitutions, from 1776 to 1788, and the Federal\r\nConstitution in 1789, every one of them made express guarantee of this\r\nright. One or two, following the lead of Massachusetts and Virginia,\r\nrecognized equality also, or, at least, equality by birth and before\r\nthe law; but without exception property was expressly recognized as\r\none of two leading constitutional rights, and even in some States,\r\nlike Virginia, it was termed a natural right. The same thing is\r\ntrue of the Massachusetts Bill of Rights and in the Federal Fifth\r\nAmendment, though it is significant that the Declaration of\r\nIndependence omits the word _property_, and only mentions among\r\nunalienable rights, life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--which\r\nsome courts have held to include private property.[1] Nevertheless,\r\nunder our constitutions to-day, the right is not only doubly, but even\r\ntriply, guaranteed; that is to say, by all State constitutions against\r\nState action; by the Federal Constitution against national action;\r\nand finally, by the Federal government in the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nas against State action also. This is the reason why, in any case\r\naffecting a cardinal liberty or property right, a litigant may\r\ncarry his case not only through the State courts, which have sole\r\njurisdiction of ordinary business and domestic matters, but to the\r\ncourts of the United States as well.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Justice Brewer, in the _Yale Law Review_, for June, 1891.\r\nHe holds that under \"the pursuit of happiness\" comes the acquisition,\r\npossession, and enjoyment of property, and that they are matters which\r\neven government cannot forbid nor destroy. That, except in punishment\r\nfor crime, no man's property can be taken without just compensation,\r\nand he closes: \"Instead of saying that all private property is held at\r\nthe mercy of the public, it is a higher truth that all rights of the\r\nstate in the property of the individual are at the expense of the\r\npeople.\"]\r\n\r\nWhen we come to legislation on the subject, or to modern State\r\nconstitutions, there is hardly a change in this particular. Naturally,\r\nwe find no new legislation confirming the right of property\r\nabstractly, or restating that that institution is part of our\r\ncivilization. There is but one significant exception to this\r\nstatement. While most of the States in their constitutions declare\r\nthat men have a natural right to acquire, possess, and protect\r\nproperty, and Kentucky and Arkansas go to the length of saying that\r\nthe right of property is \"before and higher than any constitutional\r\nsanction\"--which latter statement is a legal hyperbole--Oklahoma in\r\nits recent constitution, North Carolina, and Missouri state only that\r\nmen have a natural right to the enjoyment of the fruits of their own\r\nlabor; on the other hand there are recent intimations coming from\r\nFederal sources that individualism or private property rights, at\r\nleast, and not anarchism or socialism, are part of our constitutional\r\nsystem. Before 1907 a Texas district judge refused to naturalize an\r\nimmigrant on the ground that he was a socialist and that socialism was\r\ninconsistent with the Federal Constitution; and in that year Congress\r\npassed an act to regulate all immigration of aliens, which excludes,\r\namong other classes, persons who believe in or advocate the overthrow\r\nby force or violence of the government of the United States or of all\r\ngovernment, or of all forms of law--a definition which would exclude\r\nanarchists, but not socialists; and in the case of South Carolina _v_.\r\nUnited States (199 U.S. 437), the Supreme Court of the United States\r\ngave serious consideration to the question whether State socialism was\r\ncompatible with a republican form of government. This is all, so far\r\nas I am aware, that a century and a half of legislation has given us\r\naffirming the abstract right of property, though there are several\r\nconstructive statutes and constitutional provisions applied to the\r\ngeneral right to trade or labor, which we shall consider when we come\r\nto that subject.\r\n\r\nWhen a right is expressly guaranteed by the Constitution, we need\r\nordinarily have no affirmative legislation about it. Liberty and\r\nproperty being always guaranteed by the State constitutions, it has\r\nnot been necessary for the States to legislate to protect them.\r\n\r\nOur study of this subject, therefore, will be confined to the\r\nrestrictive or limiting legislation affecting private property or\r\nproperty rights, and of this we shall find plenty. Now there are four,\r\nand only four, methods by which the state, that is to say, American\r\nsociety as organized into governments, interferes with the right to\r\nproperty or the enjoyment and use thereof; that is to say, taxation,\r\nwhich is, of course, general; eminent domain, a peculiarly American\r\ndoctrine; the police power; and the regulation of rates and charges.\r\nSome authorities place the last under the police power; but It does\r\nnot seem to me that it historically, if logically, belongs there.\r\n\r\nStarting with the simplest first--eminent domain, an American doctrine\r\nwhich, in its simplest form, subjects the land of any one to the need\r\nof the state or, in cases authorized by the Federal Constitution,\r\nof the nation. It is questionable whether it applies to personal\r\nproperty. It is an American doctrine, for in England where the king\r\nremained in theory the feudal over-lord, it was not necessary for him\r\nor the sovereign Parliament, wishing to take or control land, and\r\nhaving no constitution protecting property rights against such action,\r\nto invent any new doctrine; but with us all land is allodial. The old\r\ncharters of the original States creating tenures in free and common\r\nsocage are, of course, obsolete. Everybody is a freeholder, and the\r\nStates are not, still less the Federal government, a feudal over-lord.\r\nNevertheless, the property of every one must be subject to the supreme\r\ncommon necessity; and the right is absolute in the States, although\r\nlimited in the national government by the Federal Constitution. It\r\nis an American constitutional principle; and this principle also\r\nprovides, as does Magna Charta and the early charters of England as to\r\n_personal_ property seized by royal purveyors, that full damages must\r\nbe paid; and to this general principle our constitutions have added\r\nthat the damages must be paid at the time of the taking and the amount\r\nbe determined by due process of law; that is to say, in most cases\r\nby a jury. Blackstone says: \"So great is the regard of the law for\r\nprivate property that it will not authorize the least violation of it;\r\nno, not even for the general good of the whole community\";[1] a new\r\nroad, for instance, cannot be made without consent of the owner of the\r\nland, and the words \"eminent domain\" do not appear in the text of his\r\nbook. But though we hold the contrary doctrine, the rights of the\r\nproperty owner are sufficiently protected when the taking is directed\r\nby the State, or even by a city or town. The menace to property here,\r\nwith the increasing bulk of legislation, comes in the number of _new_\r\nuses, not only directly for the State or for cities and towns, but for\r\npublic-service corporations, or often other private corporations, and\r\nassociations of persons, who are permitted by legislation to take land\r\nunder eminent domain, or, what is often worse, to acquire easements\r\nover it. Most of the States give damages for land not actually taken,\r\nbut damaged, though our Federal courts have not held this to be\r\nnecessary under the Fourteenth Amendment; but although land can still,\r\nin theory, only be taken for a public use, the number of uses which\r\nour legislation makes public Is being enormously increased. The usual\r\nnational purposes are forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other\r\nneedful buildings. Independent of some express permission in the\r\nConstitution, the Federal government has no power to take, or even to\r\nown, land at all within the State limits. Therefore, it is questioned\r\nwhether land may be taken for national parks or forest reservations\r\nexcept in the Territories, where title still remains with the Federal\r\ngovernment. But the State's power of eminent domain is unlimited,\r\nalthough it began only with the towns or counties taking roads for\r\nhighways, and cities and towns appropriating lands for schools and\r\nother public buildings. Probably the only serious addition of a\r\nwholly public use is covered by the general expression, parks and\r\nplaygrounds; but the analogy of the highway led to the taking of land\r\nunder eminent domain for railroads, when they were first invented,\r\nthen for street railways, then for telegraph, telephone, and\r\nelectric-light lines, underground pipe-lines or conduits of all sorts,\r\nand finally, for drains, sewerage districts, public, and often private\r\nirrigation purposes. Most of the more complex State constitutions\r\ndefine at great length to the extent of some twenty or thirty\r\nparagraphs just what purposes shall be considered a public use under\r\neminent domain. In the absence of such definition, or without such\r\ndefinition, the number of such uses is being enormously increased by\r\nstatute. Thus, reservoirs, storage basins, irrigation canals, ditches,\r\nflumes, and pipes for water drainage, or mining purposes, working\r\nmines, as dumps, hoists, shafts, tunnels, are made a public use by the\r\nconstitutions of the arid States, Idaho and Wyoming. So as to water\r\nonly in Montana, but in Idaho also to any other use \"necessary for the\r\ncomplete development of the material resources of the State or the\r\npreservation of the health of its inhabitants.\"[2] And even by private\r\nparties, land may be taken for ways of necessity in many States, and\r\nfor drains, flumes, and aqueducts by the constitutions of the arid\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Book I, p. 139.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: These provisions are collated in \"Federal and State\r\nConstitutions,\" p. 159.]\r\n\r\nAt common law, of course, a man or a set of men, who happen to be\r\nneighbors, would have had no right to take my land for a private way,\r\nor for drainage or irrigation purposes, however beneficial to their\r\nland; still less to take water from my stream across my land to their\r\nfields. But this precise thing can be done in an increasing number of\r\nStates, although it has been held unconstitutional in the courts\r\nof one or two of the far Western States, and has even yet not been\r\ndecided by the Supreme Court of the United States as to the powers of\r\nthe Federal government. Under the broad definition given in Idaho\r\nand Wyoming, you can probably take land to establish a municipal\r\ncoal-yard, or dispensary, or anything else that the legislature might\r\nsuppose to be for the general health or benefit of the people. Yet\r\na hotel company would not, as yet, be considered a public use, nor,\r\nprobably, a private recreation park. And land taken for one use may be\r\nsubjected to other and totally distinct uses without giving any new\r\nright of damages, as was decided in Massachusetts, at least, when land\r\ngiven or taken for an ordinary city street was afterward occupied by a\r\nsteam railroad. A notable limitation on the use of streets, however,\r\nwe find imposed by the statutes of New York and many other States,\r\nwhich provide that no railway shall be placed therein without the\r\nconsent of a majority of the property owners or abutters. There is\r\nfrequent legislation providing that the betterment taxes collected in\r\ncase of public improvement shall not exceed the damages given for the\r\nproperty actually taken. In the last two or three years there has been\r\nan extension of the doctrine, authorizing cities and towns to take\r\nmore land than is actually needed, for the purpose of convenience, or\r\nin order to get a better bargain, and then sell the surplus; but such\r\nlaws may be unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nLand may, of course, be taken for all municipal purposes, including\r\npublic squares or parks, playgrounds, reformatories and penal\r\ninstitutions, levees, ditches, drains, and for cemeteries; and the\r\nright is being granted to private companies other than those above\r\nmentioned, in Colorado, to tunnel, transportation, electric power, and\r\naërial tramway companies; in North Carolina to flume companies; in\r\nmany States for private irrigation districts; in the West generally to\r\nmining or quarrying companies; in West Virginia and other States to\r\nelectric power, light, or gas companies; while in North Carolina,\r\nWashington, and Wisconsin, we find the dangerous grant of this great\r\npower to electric-power companies, which are, in Wisconsin at least,\r\nexpressly permitted to flood lands by right of eminent domain in order\r\nto form ponds for power purposes. It is easy to see that under such\r\nlegislation everybody holds his land not only subject to public need,\r\nbut to the greed of any designing neighbor. Perhaps the most important\r\nquestion of eminent domain is or was whether it authorized\r\ngeneral schemes of internal improvement made by the State or by a\r\nmunicipality, or, worse still, by a private corporation chartered for\r\nthe purpose. The Constitution of Michigan, with those of the Dakotas\r\nand Wyoming, provides that the State cannot be interested in works of\r\ninternal improvement, nor, in North Dakota and Wyoming, engage in them\r\nexcept on two-thirds vote of the people; nor, in Alabama, may it\r\nloan its credit in support of such works; nor, also, in Maryland,\r\nMinnesota, Ohio, and Wisconsin, create or contract debts for them;\r\nnor, in Kansas and Michigan again, be a party to carrying on such\r\nworks. But the Tennessee Constitution declares that a well-regulated\r\nsystem of internal improvement should be encouraged by the\r\nlegislature. So, in Virginia, no town or county may become a party to\r\nany work of internal improvement except roads, and they are frequently\r\nforbidden from borrowing money for such purposes. There is, therefore,\r\nconsiderable constitutional check to legislation in this direction.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Federal and State Constitutions,\" book III, secs.\r\n92, 324, 345 370, 391, and 395.]\r\n\r\nTaxation, of course, has from all time been the universal limitation\r\nupon property rights, though it is important to remember that until\r\nthe present budget there has not in modern times been an attempt at\r\ndirect taxation of the capital value of land in England; Cobbett\r\nrecords many \"aids\" of a few shillings per hide of land in\r\nAnglo-Norman times. The earliest taxation was the feudal aids imposed\r\npurely for defensive purposes, for building forts and bridges; later\r\nfor foreign wars or crusades. We have traced the origin of the\r\nscutage tax as a substitute for military service and the two great\r\nconstitutional principles that all taxation must be with the common\r\nconsent of the realm; that is to say, of Parliament, later of the\r\nHouse of Commons; and must also and equally be for the common benefit.\r\nTheorists have argued, particularly with us, that under the latter\r\nprinciple protective tariffs are unconstitutional; but even if it be\r\nadmitted that they are not for the benefit of the whole people, the\r\nexception is as old as the rule; protective tariff laws, and, earlier\r\nstill, laws absolutely prohibitive of importation, being plentiful\r\non the English statute-books before and at the time this earliest\r\nof constitutional principles appeared. There is a step beyond the\r\nprotective tariffs, however, which is naturally mentioned in this\r\nconnection, and that is the bounty--sums of money paid to certain\r\ninterests and derived from the general taxes fund. Under the Acts of\r\nCongress there has been, I think, only one instance of a bounty; that\r\nis in the case of the Louisiana sugar-growers. In State legislation it\r\nhas been a little more usual. Foreign countries, notably Germany and\r\nFrance, as to beet sugar, etc., have been in the habit of giving\r\nbounties. This precedent undoubtedly suggested it; but these countries\r\ndo not enjoy our constitutional principles. There has hardly been a\r\ndirect decision on the constitutionality of the Federal bounty, but as\r\nto State bounties we find several, with an increasing tendency to hold\r\nvoid such laws. There can be no question that they are utterly against\r\nour whole constitutional system. The Supreme Court, when considering\r\nsugar-bounty laws, seems to have thought that it might be sustained\r\nas a compensation made for a moral obligation, the Louisiana planters\r\nhaving been led into industries from which the protection was suddenly\r\nremoved; of such nature must be the justification, if any, for\r\nbounties given in times of flood, fire, or public disaster, which,\r\nhowever, are really sustained only in the absence of objection and on\r\nthe principle _lex non curat de minimis._ The most insidious form of\r\nthe bounty, however, is that of exemption from taxation, or, still\r\nworse, granting subsidies or subscribing to the stock and bonds of\r\npublic-service, or even ordinary private, corporations. Undoubtedly\r\nthe exception has been established in the case of railroads. The\r\ngranting of State, city, or county aid to railroads has existed almost\r\nfrom their invention, probably on the analogy of highways; at all\r\nevents, it is too late to be constitutionally questioned now. The\r\nexemption from taxation of private profitable enterprises, such as\r\nmills or factories, is less defensible. Frequently, however, they go\r\nwithout question, it being to no one's particular interest to do so.\r\nThe usual subjects of State bounties were, in 1890, beet-root sugar,\r\nbinding twine, iron and iron pipe, potato starch, and rope, with tax\r\nexemptions to Portland-cement works. Ramie fibre continued a favorite\r\nsubject of bounty for some years, with seed distributions to farmers,\r\nwhich were in some States held unconstitutional. In 1896 Utah gave a\r\nbounty on canaigre leather and silk culture. There was an exemption\r\non salt plants in Michigan, but beet sugar continued the favorite\r\nbeneficiary. There has been a reaction against bounty legislation of\r\nrecent years. In 1908, for instance, New York repealed its bounty\r\non beet sugar, and it may be hoped, with greater intelligence\r\nof constitutional principles, that all such legislation will be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nComing to matters of ordinary taxation, of course the first thing to\r\nnote is its extraordinary extent. In direct taxation it is not\r\nan unfair estimate to say that the States and their municipal\r\norganizations undertake to impose an annual assessment on real\r\nand personal property which would average at least two per cent.\r\nthroughout the country; amounting to from one-third to one-half of the\r\nincome derived therefrom. In indirect taxation, duties, and revenue\r\ntaxes, a sum far greater is taken from the average household. One\r\nmight very much wish that the individual householder might at least\r\nknow how large a sum is thus taken from his earnings annually, for it\r\nis safe to say that in no civilized country, not even in the France\r\nbefore the Revolution, was individual taxation anything like so heavy.\r\nTherefore, we are beginning to find legislation, even constitutional\r\nprovisions, carefully limiting the tax rate. The amount of the State\r\ntax is thus limited in probably half the States, mostly Southern or\r\nWestern, and nearly all of them limit also the amount of taxation to\r\nbe imposed by the counties, cities, towns, school districts, or for\r\nother special purposes. In the North-eastern States such limitation\r\nis not usual, though in Massachusetts and New York it exists as to\r\ncertain cities. It may properly be said of such legislation that it\r\ndoes not appear to be so futile as one might have expected. There\r\nis, of course, a tendency to raise the limit, involving frequent\r\nconstitutional amendment, or, in Massachusetts, for instance,\r\nwhere the limitation is put on only by statutes, by later statutes\r\nauthorizing the borrowing outside of the debt limit; for it should be\r\nsaid that such limitations do usually apply both to the appropriations\r\nand to the funded indebtedness incurred. Still I have not observed\r\nin the last twenty years any repeal of such laws or constitutional\r\nprovisions, but rather an increasing number of States adopting them,\r\nfrom which it may be inferred that they work satisfactorily. Nearly\r\nall the States purport to tax the capital value of both real and\r\npersonal property, not, as in England, rents or incomes; and they tax\r\n\"tangibles\" and also \"intangibles.\" That is to say, they undertake to\r\ntax stocks or bonds or mortgage debts; the evidence of property, as\r\nwell as the property itself; and the debt as well as the property\r\nsecuring It. Some States, such as Pennsylvania, impose a smaller, more\r\nnominal, tax upon stocks and bonds in the hands of the owner, for\r\nthe sake of getting a larger return, but in many States, such as\r\nMassachusetts, this legislation would be unconstitutional, as not\r\nproportional taxation.\r\n\r\nThere is a mass of legislation every year directed to the\r\nassessing and collecting of taxes, tending more and more to become\r\ninquisitorial, requiring the tax payer under oath to furnish full\r\nschedules of his property, with provision for an arbitrary assessment\r\nif he fails to do so. One effect of this has been to drive very\r\nwealthy men from Ohio or other Western States to a legal residence in\r\nthe East, where the laws are more lenient, or their enforcement more\r\nlax. The problem is a most important one and I see no signs yet of any\r\nsolution in the increasing mass of legislation one finds upon this\r\nsubject every year. It is to be noted--what our socialist friends have\r\nnever seemed to observe--that just in so far as a man's earnings or\r\nincome are taken from him in the form of taxation, you are already in\r\na state of socialism. That is to say, to that extent is his income\r\ntaken from him and administered by the state. This is an observation\r\nmost unwelcome to the opponents of capitalism, so-called, who resent\r\nthe conclusion that if the State and Federal governments are already\r\ntaking forty per cent. of his income from him, a state of perfect\r\nsocialism could do no more than take the other sixty per cent. This\r\nwhole problem of taxation, indeed, is evaded at present only by the\r\nmiserable solution of fraud; hardly any one, except the non-propertied\r\nclasses, paying what the law purports to take from them; and the\r\nnon-propertied classes only pay it because their taxation, being\r\nindirect, is paid for them by others.\r\n\r\nComing to other forms of taxation, we may distinguish three: Income,\r\nsuccession, and license. Income taxation in England dates, it is said,\r\nfrom 1435; but (in the shape of tithes) it is far older. The power of\r\nincome taxation (except upon earnings and profits) belongs here only\r\nto the States; just as the sole power of imposing duties on imports is\r\ngiven to the Federal government. Many of the States impose an income\r\ntax, but I observe no particular increase in that kind of taxation in\r\nthe legislation of the last twenty years. A man's income is commonly\r\ntaxed with his other property. It is a form of tax far more evaded\r\nhere than in England, probably because the English law provides a\r\nmachinery for collecting a large part of income taxation from the\r\npersons from whom the income is derived, as, for instance, from the\r\ntenant who pays rent to a landlord; just as with us a corporation\r\nis made to pay the tax on its capital stock nominally due from the\r\nindividual owner. The only notable extension of income tax legislation\r\nis in the establishment of the principle of the _graded_ income tax,\r\nwhich is beginning to be adopted in a few States, as in North and\r\nSouth Carolina in 1897.\r\n\r\nThis principle of graduated taxation has, however, been nearly\r\nuniversal in our next and more modern variety--the succession tax. The\r\nold English precedents are the \"aids\" and fines for alienation. But\r\nbeginning here about 1893, this form of taxation has now been adopted\r\nby nearly all the States, the amount of the tax being graded both\r\naccording to the relation of the inheritors to the person from\r\nwhom the succession is derived, and according to the amount of the\r\ninheritance itself; the rate of the tax thus varying all the way from\r\nan absolute exemption, as to the wife or children, to a tax as high as\r\ntwenty-five per cent. (in New York) in the case of large estates going\r\nto remote relatives. The Federal inheritance tax imposed at the time\r\nof the Spanish war was soon repealed, and this domain of taxation,\r\nwith the income tax, is now almost universally employed by the States.\r\nThe principle itself can hardly be carried much farther, but it will\r\nbe necessary to have some understanding or arrangement between the\r\nStates, whereby double or treble succession taxes are not imposed\r\non the same estate, as notably in the case of the stock or bonds of\r\nrailroads chartered in several States, all of which may undertake to\r\nimpose full succession taxes upon such stock. It has been held\r\nthat succession taxes may be graded even in cases where a State\r\nconstitution provides for proportionate taxation, the tax being an\r\nexcise tax and not a direct property tax; but this is not so in\r\nrespect to income taxes. We may assume therefore that income taxes\r\nmust be equal in States which have this constitutional provision,\r\nalthough in one or two of them recent statutes have exempted a portion\r\nof the income of veterans of the Civil War. This might be sustained as\r\na pension, pensions being for actual military service constitutional,\r\nand are in the Southern States expressly permitted to Confederate\r\nsoldiers and their families--despite the implied prohibition of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nThe last form of taxation, that of an excise upon licenses or trades,\r\nis most usual in the South. An increasing number of trades are thus\r\nbeing taxed or regulated. Sometimes the taxation is put under the\r\nguise of a fee for examination and licensing, sometimes plainly as an\r\nexcise tax. Undoubtedly such taxation is against all the history\r\nof our legislation demanding complete freedom of labor and trade.\r\nNevertheless, it has not been held unconstitutional by the States\r\nexcept, of course, when touching a trade which is interstate commerce,\r\nthough the _examination_ occasionally has been. Such taxation has not\r\nyet become popular in the North, except definitely for the purpose of\r\nexamination and license; but it is almost universal in the South, many\r\nStates indeed providing by their constitution or laws that all trades\r\nand callings may be thus taxed. These taxes may be arbitrary in\r\namount, but are sometimes graded according to the amount of business\r\ndone. Such legislation has been sustained in so far as it is a tax or\r\na license imposed for protecting the public health in a reasonable\r\nmanner; thus, doctors, plumbers, nurses, dentists, etc., have been\r\nsubmitted to such regulation, but in the case of blacksmiths its\r\nconstitutionality was in one State denied, and the law as to barbers\r\nin several States annulled. Nevertheless, it will always be a popular\r\nmethod of raising money in the poorer States, where land already bears\r\nits full burden and little personal property can be found.\r\n\r\nCommissions of inquiry on this whole subject of taxation are\r\ncontinually being appointed--we have had two in Massachusetts in\r\nthe past ten years--and their recommendations nearly always prove\r\nunacceptable. The probable scientific answer, that you must only tax\r\nproperty and not money or the evidence of property, and that if direct\r\ntaxation thereby becomes too burdensome we must reduce our rate of\r\nexpenditure, is a conclusion our legislators are yet unwilling to\r\naccept. The taxation of corporations presents a different problem\r\nand we shall therefore leave it for special consideration with that\r\nsubject. The matter of betterment taxes may be dismissed with a\r\nword, as it is hardly, in theory, taxation at all, but rather using\r\nmunicipal agencies to collect the cost, or part of the cost, of a\r\nlocal work or benefit. It is, of course, closely connected with the\r\nsubject of eminent domain. That is to say, only a public use, or at\r\nleast a general local benefit, can justify a betterment tax. There is\r\nstill considerable legislation on this matter, confined generally to\r\nthe objects of securing a jury trial, or at least a public hearing, on\r\nthe amount of the assessment, defining the purposes for which it\r\nmay be imposed, as, for instance, paving, sewers, water-works where\r\npublic, and--perhaps the most contested case of all--that of parks or\r\npleasure-grounds; and providing that the amount of betterment taxes\r\nimposed shall not exceed one-half the value of the improvement of the\r\nproperty, and shall never exceed the amount paid as damages when part\r\nof the owner's land is taken.\r\n\r\nBy far the greatest mass of legislation relating to property is\r\nconcerned with the police power and modern extensions thereof. It\r\nis also by far the most dangerous to property rights, and this for\r\nseveral reasons: firstly, it involves the destruction of property\r\nwithout any compensation whatever, not upon payment of damages, as in\r\nthe ease of eminent domain; secondly, on account of the extraordinary\r\nextension by our modern legislation of this power to matters not\r\nhitherto deemed necessary for the safety, health, or even the\r\nwell-being of the public, vague as the legal application of the last\r\nword is; thirdly, and perhaps most important, because the police\r\npower is usually exercised without any common-law guarantees, without\r\nprocess of law or jury trial, but by the arbitrary ruling of some\r\nboard, or even single commissioner, and often, so far as the statute\r\nis concerned, without a jury or even an appeal from the commissioner's\r\nruling to any court of law.\r\n\r\nI believe this to be the most dangerous tendency that now confronts\r\nthe American people--government by commission, tenfold more dangerous\r\nthan \"government by injunction.\" Not only is there no liberty, no\r\nappeal to common right and the courts, but all permanent \"boards\" tend\r\nto become narrow and pedantic or, worse, to be controlled by the works\r\nthey are created to control.[1] The constitutionality of such boards\r\nis, of course, always questionable, but the tendency to create them is\r\nperhaps the most striking thing in modern American legislation. Not\r\nonly do we find them in enormously increased numbers in all the\r\nStates, but even a late President of the United States seriously\r\nrecommended that the contracts and affairs of all corporations at\r\nleast (and the bulk of modern business is done in corporate form)\r\nshould be so submitted to the control or dictation, or even the\r\nnullification, of such an administrative board or commission, and this\r\nagain with no appeal to the courts. So audacious an upsetting of\r\nall Anglo-Saxon ideas of the right to law, it may be said without\r\nexaggeration, has never been attempted in the history of the English\r\npeople, not even by the Stuart kings, who were most of all disposed\r\nto interfere in such particulars. Wiser counsels deterred the\r\nadministration from insisting on this measure, but the fact that it\r\ncould be brought up, and that with the approval of a large portion of\r\nthe public, indicates how radical our legislation is getting to be in\r\nthis particular.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Two singular instances happened only the past year: at\r\ncommon law any one may build railroads, and they are certainly for the\r\ngeneral advantage whether profitable to the owners or not. Yet the\r\nrailroad commissions of New York and Massachusetts have recently\r\nin each State prevented the building of most important lines, by\r\nresponsible applicants--under the opposition of other railroads.]\r\n\r\nIt is a commonplace in the law that no court has defined, or ever will\r\nconsent to define, the exact limits of this police power; suffice\r\nit to say that in the classic words of Chief Justice Shaw of\r\nMassachusetts, \"it is all that makes for the health, safety, or\r\ncomfort of the people.\" As to the health and safety, there can be\r\nlittle question; but when it comes to indefinite words like \"comfort\"\r\nor \"well-being,\" too wide a field is left for the imagination. It\r\nhas recently been decided that the aesthetic part of life does not\r\nnecessarily concern the comfort or well-being of the people. That is\r\nto say, laws forbidding the use of land for the erection of hideous\r\nsigns, or forbidding the height of buildings at an inartistic excess\r\nhave been declared not to fall within the police power, but under\r\neminent domain. So of statutes forbidding the taking of a man's\r\npicture, or a woman's portrait for advertising purposes, when not\r\nproperly obtained; yet it may be questioned if any law is more\r\ncertainly for the comfort of the persons concerned than such a\r\nstatute. On the other hand, noisy or noxious trades, mosquito ponds,\r\ntrees infected with moths, etc., sawdust in water, offensive smoke,\r\nand, in Vermont, signs, were all made nuisances by statute of one\r\nState or other in 1905 alone. The first historical instance, perhaps,\r\nof destruction of property under the police power was the blowing\r\nup of buildings to check a conflagration, a practice still common,\r\nalthough its utility was much questioned after the Boston fire,\r\nand which, at common law at least, gave the owner no right to\r\ncompensation; but the more usual use of the police power until very\r\nrecent years has been limited to the prohibition of offensive trades\r\nin certain localities, and the suppression of public nuisances. Later,\r\nthe prohibition of the manufacture of intoxicating or malt liquors,\r\nand the regulation of tenement houses at the orders of the Board of\r\nHealth. This led to the regulation or prohibition of certain trades\r\nconducted in tenement houses or in sweat shops, and to other matters\r\nwhich we shall find it more convenient to consider under the head of\r\nlabor legislation.\r\n\r\nWhether there are any limits to this power is much discussed. There is\r\nno question that the power must not be arbitrary or utterly without\r\nreason, and of that reason the courts must and do in fact judge.\r\nTaking property for a purpose unjustified by the police power is,\r\nof course, taking property without due process of law. An arbitrary\r\nstatute taking the property of _A_ and giving it to _B_, or even to\r\nthe public, without compensation has, from the time of Lord Coke\r\nhimself, been the classic definition of an unjustifiable law and one\r\nwhich with us at least is unconstitutional; but our courts wisely\r\nrefuse to judge if, when a proper police motive is disclosed in the\r\nstatute, it is the _best_ method of effecting the result. This, I\r\nthink, is a clear statement of the principle of our court decisions.\r\nIf, upon the face of the statute, the court can see no possible\r\nrelation to the public health or safety, or, possibly, general\r\nwelfare, it will hold the law null in so far as it invades either\r\nproperty or liberty rights because not under the police power. If, on\r\nthe other hand, they can see _some_ relation to the public health,\r\nsafety, or general welfare, even though they do not think it the best\r\nmethod of bringing about the desired result, they will not presume to\r\nrun counter to legislative opinion. Of the expediency of the statute,\r\nthe legislature must be and is the final judge.\r\n\r\nWith us the police power is exercised largely for moral reasons. That\r\nis to say, the great instances of its extension have been connected\r\nwith moral or sanitary reform. No doubt the police power may broaden\r\nwith advancing civilization and more complex appliances and possibly\r\ngreater medical knowledge and social solidarity. No doubt purposes\r\nwhich were once lawful may be unlawful, and property devoted to them\r\nthus be destroyed by a change in the law. Mr. Justice Brewer, of\r\nour Supreme Court, holding the contrary view, was overruled by the\r\nmajority, and that decision is final.[1] Not only we, but a State, may\r\nnot even make a contract which shall be immune from future extension\r\nof the police power, the Dartmouth College case notwithstanding. For\r\ninstance, the State of Massachusetts in 1827 granted a perpetual\r\nfranchise to a corporation to make beer. It was allowed, forty years\r\nlater, to pass a law that no corporation should make beer, and the\r\nbrewery became valueless. The State of Minnesota granted a perpetual\r\nfranchise to a railroad to fix its own fares. Twenty years later\r\nit took away that right, thereby, as claimed, making the railroad\r\nproperty valueless; the railroad had no remedy. A man in Connecticut\r\nhad barrels of whiskey in a cellar for many years, but the State was\r\nallowed to pass a law prohibiting its sale; which, of course, had he\r\nbeen a teetotaler, would have deprived that property of all value, and\r\nin any case, of all exchange value. A man in Iowa owns one glass of\r\nwhiskey for several years, and then a law is passed forbidding him to\r\nsell it; the law is valid. A youth in Nebraska buys tobacco and paper\r\nand rolls a cigarette. The State afterward passes a law forbidding\r\nsmoking by minors. It is a crime if he light it. Sufficient has,\r\nperhaps, been said to show the extraordinary scope and elasticity of\r\nthis, the widest, vaguest, and most dangerous domain of our modern\r\nlegislation, though perhaps we should add one or two striking\r\ncases affecting personal liberty, as, for instance, a citizen of\r\nPennsylvania marries his first cousin in Delaware and returns to\r\nPennsylvania, where the marriage is void and he becomes guilty of a\r\ncriminal offence; a white man in Massachusetts who marries a negress\r\nor mulatto may be guilty of the crime of miscegenation in other\r\nStates; a woman might work fifty-eight hours a week in Rhode Island,\r\nbut if she work over fifty-six in Massachusetts may involve her\r\nemployer, as well as herself, in a penal offence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mugler _v_. Kansas, 123 U. S, 623.]\r\n\r\nThe most valuable of all police legislation is, of course, that to\r\nprotect public health and safety; and prominent in the legislation of\r\nthe last twenty years are the laws to secure pure and wholesome\r\nfood and drugs. Possibly \"wholesome\" is saying too much, for our\r\nlegislative intelligence has not yet arrived at an understanding of\r\nthe danger from cold storage or imperfectly canned food, though Canada\r\nand other English colonies have already legislated on the subject, to\r\nsay nothing of our tariff war with Germany on the point. One may guess\r\nthat ninety-nine per cent. of the present food of the American people,\r\nleaving out the farmers themselves, is of meat of animals which have\r\nbeen dead many months, If not years, and from vegetables which date at\r\nleast many months back. It is nonsense to suppose that such food is\r\nequally wholesome with fresh food, or that there is not considerable\r\nrisk of acute poisoning or a permanent impairment of the digestive\r\nsystem. Senator Stewart, of Nevada, has shown that nearly fifty per\r\ncent. of the soldiers of the Spanish War had permanent digestive\r\ntrouble, as against less than three per cent. in the Civil War, which\r\ntook place before cold-storage food was known, or canned food largely\r\nin use. It was hopeless for the States to act until there was\r\nFederal legislation on the subject, as the health authorities had no\r\nconstitutional power over goods imported from other States; but the\r\npassage, under Roosevelt, of a national food and drugs act has given\r\na great impetus to the reform, and by this writing more than half the\r\nStates have passed pure-food laws, being usually, as they obviously\r\nshould be, an exact copy of the Federal Act. Among the articles\r\nspecially mentioned in such legislation we find candy, vinegar, meat,\r\nfertilizers, milk, butter, spices, sugar, cotton seed, formaldehyde,\r\ninsecticide, and general provisions against adulteration, false\r\ncoloring, the use of colors and preservatives, etc.\r\n\r\nGoing from matters merely unwholesome to actual poisons, the course of\r\nlegislation on intoxicating liquors is too familiar to the reader\r\nto make it necessary to more than refer to it, with the general\r\nobservation that in the North and East the tendency has been toward\r\nhigh licensing or careful regulation, always with local option; while\r\nin the West originally, and now in the South, the tendency is to\r\nabsolute \"State-wide\" prohibition and even to express this principle\r\nin the constitution. How much this extreme measure is based on the\r\nracial question, in the South at least, is a matter of some debate;\r\nand the working of such laws everywhere from Maine to Georgia, of\r\nconsiderably more. One may hazard the guess that the wealthier\r\nclasses have no difficulty in getting their liquor through interstate\r\ncommerce, while the more disreputable classes succeed in getting it\r\nsurreptitiously. Prohibition, therefore, if effective at all, is\r\nprobably only effective among the respectable middle class where,\r\nperhaps, of all it is least needed. In the older States, at least in\r\nMassachusetts, there has been a decided tendency away from prohibition\r\nin the last twenty years, and even from local prohibition in the\r\nlarger cities. Worcester, for instance, after being the largest\r\nprohibition city in the world, ceased to be so this year by the\r\nlargest vote ever cast upon the question.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said of the strict prohibition of liquor dealing, no\r\none can have any objection to such laws as applied to cocaine, opium,\r\nor other poisonous drugs, and we find statutes of this sort in\r\nincreasing number; while the manufacture and sale of cigarettes\r\nto minors or even in some States, their consumption, is strictly\r\nprohibited, under criminal penalty. Laws of a similar sort were aimed\r\nat oleomargarine when invented, but this probably not so much to\r\nprotect the health of the people as the prosperity of the dairymen.\r\nThe mass of such legislation has emerged from the scrutiny of the\r\ncourts, State and Federal, with the general result that only such laws\r\nwill be sustained as are aimed to prevent fraud; but the manufacture\r\nand sale of oleomargarine under that name cannot be prohibited.\r\nArtificial coloring matter may be forbidden, but a New Hampshire law\r\nwas not sustained which required all oleomargarine to be colored pink;\r\nso it may be guessed that the laws of those States which make criminal\r\nthe sale or use of cigarettes to or by children \"_apparently_\" less\r\nthan sixteen or eighteen, will hardly be sustained as a constitutional\r\npolice measure; yet such laws existed in 1890, while the State of\r\nWashington in 1893 made the sale even of cigarette paper criminal.\r\n\r\nAnother important line of modern legislation consists in the\r\nsubjecting of trades to a license for the purpose of _examination_\r\n(the tax feature has been discussed above). Such laws are\r\nconstitutional when applied to a trade really relating to the public\r\nhealth, but as we have found above, black-smithing is not such an\r\none; when imposed merely for the purpose of raising revenue,\r\nsuch legislation is undoubtedly constitutional under our written\r\nconstitutions, but opposed to historic English principles, which\r\ninsisted for seven centuries of statute-making on the utmost liberty\r\nof trade. In a South American republic you have to get a concession\r\nbefore going into almost any business, even maintaining a shoe-shop,\r\nor a milk farm, which concession is, of course, often obtained by\r\nbribery or withheld for corrupt reasons. It is to be hoped that the\r\ncitizens of our States will never find themselves in that predicament.\r\nStill, certain State constitutions, as that of South Carolina, provide\r\nabsolutely that all trades may be made subject to a tax, and the\r\ntendency--particularly in the South--to raise revenue in this way is\r\nincreasing by leaps and bounds. Among the trades already subjected to\r\nsuch licensing or taxing, we find doctors, of course, and properly,\r\npharmacists, plumbers, pedlars, horse-shoers, osteopaths, dentists,\r\nveterinary surgeons, accountants, bakers, junk dealers, coal dealers,\r\noptometrists, architects, barbers, commission merchants, embalmers,\r\nand nurses. Of course it is a motive to novel or irregular trades to\r\nsecure a licensing law from the State, for the slight tax insures them\r\nprotection. This is the reason that we find common statutes allowing\r\nosteopaths, etc., to be licensed. So far as I have observed, there is\r\nno such statute as yet in any State applying to Christian Scientists.\r\n\r\nPolice regulation for the _safety_ of the public is found nearly\r\nentirely in the laws regulating labor, factories, mines, or machinery,\r\nand will be accordingly treated in that connection. Laws protecting\r\nthe public against fraud, which from earliest times has been a branch\r\nof police legislation, have been of late years numerous, principally\r\nin connection with the prohibition of dealing in futures or sales on\r\nmargin, of sales of goods in bulk without due precautions and notice\r\nto creditors, of the issue of trading stamps or other device tending\r\nto mislead the public. Some States have prohibited department stores,\r\nbut this legislation has been held unconstitutional, though the early\r\nEnglish labor statutes forbidding to any person more than one trade or\r\nmystery will by the historical student be borne in mind. Usury laws,\r\nof course, are still frequent, but decreasing in number with the\r\nincreasing modern tendency to allow freedom of contract in this as\r\nin other matters, except only to such persons as, for instance,\r\npawn-brokers, who peculiarly require police regulation.\r\n\r\nComing to statutes which merely facilitate business as it now exists,\r\nby far the most important movement has been the successful work of the\r\nState Commissioners on Uniformity of Law in getting their negotiable\r\ninstrument act passed in nearly all the States, and in several already\r\ntheir uniform law statute on sales, only recommended in 1907. Some\r\nprogress has been made in getting a uniform standard of weights and\r\nmeasures, and there is an increasing tendency to prescribe specific\r\nweights and markings for packages--possibly unconstitutional\r\nlegislation. Still more important as a change in previously existing\r\nlaw has been the increasing tendency to make documents other than\r\nbills and notes negotiable. Perhaps this is a matter which requires\r\nexplanation to the lay reader.\r\n\r\nThe early Anglo-Saxon law could not conceive of ownership of property\r\nas distinct from possession, and to their simple minds, when ownership\r\nwas once acquired it was impossible to divest the owner of his\r\nproperty by any symbolical delivery. Hence the very early statutes\r\nmaking fraudulent sales or conveyances of property without actual\r\nand visible change of possession. The notion of a symbol, a paper or\r\nwriting, which should represent that property would probably have\r\nimpressed them like a spell or charm in a child's fairy tale. Even\r\ntheft with asportation could not alter property rights, even in\r\nfavor of innocent purchasers, when the owner did not intend to part\r\ntherewith. A moment's recollection of what is now perhaps the most\r\nfamiliar of Teutonic saga to the ordinary reader, the text of Wagner's\r\n\"Ring of the Nibelung,\" will give ample evidence of that mental\r\nattitude. But the Oriental mind was far more subtile. To the Jews or\r\nLombards we owe the discovery of that _bill of exchange_--the first of\r\nnegotiable instruments, and the first historically to bring into\r\nour law the legal concept of a symbol of ownership which might be\r\ninstantly transferred with an absolute change of title in the property\r\nthereby represented, and this either to a present transferee or to one\r\nfar away. Thus, a simple bill of exchange might transfer the ownership\r\nin a pile of gold in a moment from a man in Venice to a man in London,\r\nthereby (if the law-merchant was respected) freeing the treasure\r\nitself from attack at the hands of the Venetian authorities. And not\r\nonly was this change of ownership instantaneously effected by the\r\ntransfer of some symbol or document representing it, but there also,\r\nand as a necessary part of the invention, grew up the doctrine that\r\nthe transferee was relieved of any claims against the property at the\r\nhands of the previous owner. This is what we mean by negotiable;\r\nand it is essential that the precise meaning of the word should be\r\nunderstood if we are to understand the importance of this legislation.\r\nEven most business men have a very vague understanding of the\r\ndifference between _negotiable_ and _assignable_. Substantially\r\nall property and choses in action are assignable, except personal\r\ncontracts; and in ordinary business many of them are assumed to\r\nbe negotiable, such as bills of lading, warehouse receipts, trust\r\nreceipts, or certificates of stock. Most brokers, or even bankers,\r\nassume that when they have a stock certificate duly endorsed to\r\nthem by the owner mentioned on its face they have an absolute and\r\nunimpeachable title to the stock therein represented. Such, of course,\r\nis not the case except for recent statutes in a few States. To take a\r\nfamiliar example, and I can think of none better to show exactly the\r\ndifference between a personal contract non-assignable, a document\r\nwhich is assignable, and one which is negotiable--a Harvard-Yale\r\nfoot-ball ticket. If the ticket is issued by the management to a\r\nperson under his name, with a condition that it shall be used by no\r\none else, it is a contract non-assignable. If it is issued to him in\r\nthe same manner, but with no provision against assignment or the use\r\nby another person, it would entitle such other person to whom the\r\nticket was given to use the seat, but only under the title of the\r\noriginal holder; and if the assignment was later forbidden, or for\r\nother reasons the right recalled by the management, the holder would\r\nhave no greater title to the seat; the contract is _assignable_, but\r\nnot negotiable. The assignee takes it merely as standing in the place\r\nof the original holder and subject to all the equities between him and\r\nthe management. If, for instance, the ticket were given him by fraud,\r\nthe right to use it might be revoked and the transferee would have\r\nno greater right than the original holder. But if the ticket were\r\n_negotiable_, like a bank-note payable to bearer, the holder, not\r\nactually himself the thief, would have an absolute title to the\r\nseat without regard to anything that happened prior to his getting\r\npossession of the ticket.\r\n\r\nNow it is obvious that it is for the enormous convenience of business\r\nto have business documents made negotiable. If a banker can loan on a\r\nbill of lading or a warehouse receipt, or a trader can buy the same,\r\nor if a man can give a trust receipt to his banker agreeing that all\r\nhis general shipments or stock in trade shall be the property of that\r\nbanker until his debt is paid, it makes enormously for the rapid\r\nturning over of capital, and the extension of credit. Of course, an\r\nenormous proportion of business in the United States is conducted upon\r\ncredit, and without the invention of the negotiable instrument those\r\ncredits could not be secured without an actual delivery of the\r\ncommodities intended to secure them. And the custom of business is to\r\nconsider most such documents negotiable even when in fact they are not\r\nso. It is more than usual to loan money upon warehouse receipts, bills\r\nof lading, stock certificates or trust receipts of all descriptions,\r\nregardless of the question whether the law of the State makes them\r\nnegotiable. Hence the very great tendency to make such instruments\r\nnegotiable by statute; and I find many such laws, beginning in 1893\r\nin North Carolina, as to warehouse receipts, while the Massachusetts\r\nstatute concerning stock dates from 1884.\r\n\r\nA reaction to the English common law is the statute, common in recent\r\nyears, prohibiting sales in bulk. It appears to have been a growing\r\ncustom for merchants, particularly retail merchants, when in financial\r\ndifficulties to sell their entire stock in trade to some professional\r\npurchaser by a simple bill of sale without physical delivery. Nearly\r\nall States have adopted statutes against this practice, although in\r\nseveral they have been held unconstitutional. The feeling that they\r\nare dishonest is doubtless justified by the facts; but it may also be\r\ntruly described as a reaction to the simpler English law as against\r\nOriental innovations.\r\n\r\nThe descent of property throughout the United States is regulated by\r\nEnglish common-law ideas. That is to say, there is no primogeniture,\r\nalthough in early colonial times the older son took a double portion;\r\nand there is, except in Louisiana, complete liberty of testamentary\r\ndisposition, although in one or two other States there have been\r\nstatutes forbidding a man to dispose of all his estate to a charity\r\nwithin a short time previous to his death, to the prejudice at least\r\nof his direct heirs. The Code Napoleon, of course, limits testamentary\r\ndisposition in favor of these latter, so in Louisiana, only half of\r\na man's estate can be given away from his children or widow, and not\r\nmore than three-fourths of his estate can be bequeathed to strangers\r\nor to charity, to the prejudice even of collateral heirs.\r\n\r\nIn matters of general business the usual lines of legislation have\r\nbeen the ordinary ones found in English history. That is to say,\r\nstatutes of frauds, usury or interest laws, and other familiar\r\nmatters. The only tendency one can note is a broad range of\r\nlegislation devised in the interest of the debtor--not only liberal\r\ninsolvency laws now superseded by the national bankruptcy act, which\r\nis still more liberal than the laws of the States preceding it, but\r\nstatutes restricting or delaying foreclosure of mortgages, statutes\r\nexempting a substantial amount of property, implements of trade,\r\nagricultural articles, goods, land, or even money, from the claims of\r\nhis creditors. The exemption of tools or implements of trade goes back\r\nto Magna Charta, it will be remembered, but the exemption of other\r\narticles is modern and American. There is probably, however, no\r\nsubject which is so apt to be let alone by our legislatures as that of\r\nbusiness law. Upon that subject, at least, they are fairly modest\r\nand inclined to think that the laws of business are known better\r\nby business men. Imprisonment for debt is, of course, absolutely\r\nabolished everywhere, and in most States a woman is not subject to\r\npersonal arrest in civil process. The statutes prevailing throughout\r\nthe country, which give special preference to claims for wages or even\r\nfor material furnished by \"material men,\" have already been noted. It\r\nmay be broadly stated that the presumption is that such claims are\r\neverywhere a preferred debt to be paid out of the estate of the\r\ninsolvent, living or dead, in preference to all claims except taxes.\r\n\r\nThe security of mortgages is very generally impaired by legislation\r\nconfining the creditor to only one remedy and delaying his possession\r\nunder foreclosure. That is to say, in far Western States generally, he\r\ncannot take the land or other security, and at the same time sue the\r\ndebtor in an action for debt for the amount due, or the deficiency.\r\nThis, of course, makes of a mortgage a simple pledge. Moreover, with\r\nthe practice of delaying possession under foreclosure, appointing\r\nreceivers in the interest of the debtor, etc., he is in many States\r\nso delayed in getting possession of his security that by the time he\r\nacquires it he will find it burdened with overdue taxes and in a state\r\nof general dilapidation. We have already alluded to the practice in\r\nCalifornia of compelling the executor of a mortgage to submit\r\nhimself to the jurisdiction of the local public administrator, which\r\npractically results in a sequestration of a considerable portion of\r\nthe property. For all these reasons, many conservative lawyers in the\r\nEast, at least, would not permit their clients to invest their money\r\nin mortgages in California, Minnesota, Washington, or the other States\r\nindulging in such legislation, and partly for this reason the rate of\r\ninterest prevailing in mortgages is very much higher in the far West\r\nthan it is in States east of the Missouri River.\r\n\r\nThe greatest mass of legislation is, of course, that upon mechanic's\r\nliens, which are burdensome to a degree that is vexatious, besides\r\nbeing subject to amendment almost every year. In a general way, no\r\nland-owner is free from liability for the debt of any person who has\r\nperformed labor or furnished materials on the buildings placed upon\r\nthe land, even without the knowledge or consent of the land-owner in\r\nsome States, though in one or two instances, notably in California,\r\nsuch legislation has been carried to such an extreme as to make it\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe matter of nuisances has been already somewhat covered. Legislation\r\nextending the police power and declaring new forms or uses of property\r\nto be a nuisance is, of course, rapidly increasing in all States. The\r\ncommon-law nuisance was usually a nuisance to the sense of smell or\r\na danger to life, as, for instance, an unsanitary building or drain.\r\nNoise, that is to say, extreme noise, might also be a nuisance, and\r\nin England the interference with a man's right to light and air.\r\nLegislation is now eagerly desired in many States of this country to\r\nmake in certain cases that which is a nuisance to the sense of sight\r\nalso a legal nuisance, as, for instance, the posting of offensive\r\nbills on the fences, or the erection of huge advertising signs\r\nin parks or public highways. Such a law was, however, held\r\nunconstitutional in Massachusetts. There is some legislation against\r\nthe blowing of steam whistles by locomotives, although I believe\r\nnone against the morning whistle of factories, and some against the\r\nemission of black smoke in specified durations or quantities.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the most important legislation affecting simple matters of\r\nbusiness other than the line of statutes already mentioned, making new\r\nnegotiable instruments and controlling the title of property by the\r\npossession of a bill of exchange, bill of lading, warehouse or trust\r\nreceipt, are those statutes prohibiting the buying of \"futures,\" or\r\nthe enforcement of gambling contracts to buy or sell stocks or shares\r\nor other commodities without actual or intended change of possession,\r\nwhich we have necessarily referred to in our discussion of restraint\r\nof trade (chapter 4). There is a very decided tendency throughout the\r\ncountry, particularly in the South, to prohibit all buying or selling\r\nof futures, that is to say, of a crop not actually sold, or of any\r\narticle where physical delivery is never intended, and it will be\r\nremembered we found plenty of precedent for such legislation in\r\nearly English statutes. Gambling contracts may be forbidden only in\r\nspecified places, such as stock exchanges; and the buying of futures\r\nmay be specially permitted to favored persons, such as actual\r\nmanufacturers intending to use the goods; and both such statutes will\r\nbe held constitutional and not an undue interference with the liberty\r\nof contract. These matters were largely covered by the statutes of\r\nforestalling in early times. Legislation more distinctly modern is\r\nthat against sales in bulk, and against department stores; more\r\nstriking still is the statute, already passed in Wisconsin and\r\nVirginia, forbidding all tips, commissions, or private advantages\r\nsecured by any servant or agent in carrying on the business of his\r\nprincipal, his master, or the person with whom he deals; the statute\r\neven forbids a gratuity intentionally given directly from the one to\r\nthe other. It is hard to see how the last clause of the law can be\r\nheld constitutional, any more than the laws forbidding department\r\nstores, although such commissions may be forbidden to be given\r\n\"unbeknownst.\"\r\n\r\nWeights and measures are standardized by the Federal government, and\r\nto these standards the States in practice all conform, but the legal\r\nweight of a bushel or other measure of articles varies widely in the\r\ndifferent States, and the State Commissioners on Uniformity of Law\r\nhave tried in vain to get the matter generally regulated. At one time\r\nthe weight of a barrel of potatoes in New York City was fourteen\r\npounds more than it was in Hoboken, across the river. In Massachusetts\r\nthe weight of a barrel of onions was increased two pounds to\r\nconform with the uniform law recommended to all the States by the\r\ncommissioners; but a representative in the State Legislature coming\r\nfrom a locality of onion farms lost his seat in consequence, which\r\ninspired such terror in other members of the State Legislature that\r\nthe uniform law was promptly repealed, the weight of the barrel of\r\nonions put back at the former figure, and this over the veto of the\r\ngovernor. It is needless to say that the whole value and object of the\r\nwhole movement for uniformity is to have actual uniformity. That is to\r\nsay, unless the lawyer or citizen reading the statute can be sure that\r\nit is uniform with the laws of all other States without taking the\r\ntrouble to consult them, the reform has no value. But it has proved\r\nalmost hopeless to get this through the brain of the average\r\nlegislator. The uniform law upon bills and notes, indeed, already\r\nmentioned, is treated with more respect; because, as has been said\r\nabove, they regard that as a matter of business, and they have some\r\nrespect for the expert knowledge of business affairs possessed by\r\nbusiness men.\r\n\r\nThe licensing of trades might be made a very valuable line of\r\nlegislation to prevent the fleecing of the ultimate consumer by the\r\nmiddleman. Our ancestors were of the opinion that the middleman, the\r\nregrator, was the source of all evils, and they were also of the\r\nopinion that any combination whatever to control the price of an\r\narticle of food, or other human necessity, or to resell it elsewhere\r\nthan at its actual market and at the proper time, was a conspiracy\r\nhighly criminal and prejudicial to the English people; in both of\r\nwhich matters they were, in the writer's opinion, perfectly right, and\r\nfar more wise than our modern delusion that \"business\"--that is to\r\nsay, the making of a little more profit from the larger number of\r\npeople--justifies everything. Now, at the time of the coal famine of\r\n1903, Massachusetts passed a statute licensing dealers in coal; the\r\nlaw for the municipal coal-yard having been declared unconstitutional.\r\nThe object of this statute was not to derive revenue or to restrict\r\ntrade, but to regulate profits; and in particular to prevent\r\nthe retail coal-dealers from combining to fix the price of coal\r\nthemselves. Yet in spite of this legislation, the ice-dealers of\r\nMassachusetts only this year (1910) assembled in convention in Boston\r\nupon a call, widely advertised in the newspapers, that they were\r\nholding the assembly for that precise purpose, that is to say, to\r\nfix and control the price and the output of ice. They were, indeed,\r\n\"malefactors of great wealth\"; at least we may guess the latter, and\r\nthe animus of a more intelligent precedent may some day hopefully be\r\ndirected to such definite evils, of which our ancestors were well\r\naware, rather than blindly running amuck at all. The coal-dealers in\r\nBoston, by the way, made the same argument that is always made, and\r\nwas made at Athens in the grain combination of the third century\r\nB.C.--to wit, that they put up the prices in order to prevent other\r\npeople buying all the coal and speculating in it; but notwithstanding\r\nthat showing of their altruistic motives, the secretary of state\r\nrevoked the license of the coal company in question. The statute\r\nalso forbade the charging extortionate prices, which, again, was a\r\nperfectly proper subject of legislation under the common law; but,\r\nunfortunately, was carelessly drawn, so that it resulted in a somewhat\r\ncloudy court opinion.\r\n\r\nFor the matter of uniform legislation the reader must be referred\r\nin general to reports of the National Commission. Their greatest\r\nachievement has been the code of the law of bills and notes just\r\nmentioned. Besides this they have just adopted a code on the law of\r\nsales, and they have recommended brief and uniform formalities as well\r\nas forms for the execution and acknowledgment of deeds and wills, and\r\nhave very considerably improved the procedure in matters of divorce.\r\n\r\nThe best modern legislation concerning trade and business is, of\r\ncourse, that of the pure-food laws. The Federal law has certainly\r\nproved effective, although it is in danger of being repealed or\r\nemasculated in the interest of the \"special interests\"; most of the\r\nState laws simply copy it. Undoubtedly the laws should be identical in\r\ninterstate commerce and in all the States; and this can only be done\r\nby voluntary uniform action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nREGULATION OF RATES AND PRICES\r\n\r\n\r\nThis, the last method of infringing upon absolute rights of property,\r\nhas assumed such importance of recent years as to deserve and require\r\na chapter by itself. The reader will remember what precedents we found\r\nfor the fixing of prices, wages, and rates or tolls in England. It may\r\nbe convenient for our purposes to use these three definite words to\r\nmean the three definite things--prices in the sense of prices of goods\r\nor commodities; wages the reward of labor or personal services; and\r\nrates (the English word is tolls) for the charges of what we should\r\nnow term public-service corporations, or in old English law,\r\nfranchises, or what our Supreme Court has termed \"avocations affected\r\nwith a public interest.\" The reader will remember that the attempted\r\nregulation of prices began early and was short-lived, dating from the\r\nAssize of Bread and Beer in 1266, to the Statute of Victuals of 1362,\r\nhardly a century, and even these two precedents are not really such,\r\nfor the first only fixed the price of bread and beer according to the\r\ncost of wheat or barley, just as to-day we might conceivably fix the\r\nprice of bread at some reasonable relation to the price of flour in\r\nMinneapolis, and as it was fixed in ancient Greece by the wholesale\r\nprice of wheat at Athens[1]--not as it now is, from three to four\r\ntimes the cost of bread in London, although made out of the same flour\r\nshipped there from Minneapolis; and the two latest statutes expressly\r\nsay that they fix the price by reason of the great dearness of such\r\narticles on account of the Black Death or plague, and the consequent\r\nscarcity of labor. Then the Statute of Laborers of 1349 provided that\r\nvictuals should be sold only at reasonable prices, which apparently\r\nwere to be fixed by the mayor. With these statutes the effort to fix\r\nprices by general statute disappeared from English civilization save,\r\nof course, as prices may be indirectly affected by laws against\r\nmonopoly, engrossing, and restraint of trade; and local ordinances in\r\ntowns continued probably for some time longer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an actual report of an indictment and jury trial\r\nfor forestalling and regrating wheat in the third century B.C., see\r\nLysias's oration, translated by Dr. Frederic Earle Whitaker, in\r\n_Popular Science Monthly_, April, 1910.]\r\n\r\nLegal regulation of _wages_ lasted much longer in England; and\r\nhas reappeared in very recent years, at least in the Australasian\r\ncolonies, with a beginning of such legislation in Great Britain and\r\nIreland and the State of New York. The first Statute of Laborers\r\nmerely provides that the old wages and no more shall be given. The\r\nnext year, however, in 1350, the exact rate of wages was fixed; and\r\nthis lasted for more than two centuries, to the reign of Elizabeth,\r\nthe so-called \"great\" Statute of Laborers consolidating all the\r\nprevious ones. It is apt to be the case that when a statutory system\r\nhas reached its full development it falls into disuse; and that is\r\ncertainly the case here. There is no later statute in England until\r\n1909 fixing directly or indirectly the rate of wages; and it may be\r\ndoubted whether the justices of the peace continued to fix them for\r\nmany years under the Statute of Elizabeth. More than three centuries\r\nwere to go by before this principle reappeared in legislation or\r\nattempted legislation; but in Australia,[1] New Zealand,[2] and\r\nEngland[3] there has been recent legislation for a legally fixed rate\r\nof wages to be determined for practically all trades by a board of\r\nreferees, consisting, as such boards usually do consist, of one\r\nmember to represent capital, one to represent labor, and the third to\r\nrepresent the public or the state. As such third representative almost\r\ninvariably votes on the side of the greatest number of voters, this\r\npractically makes a commission hardly impartial. The working of the\r\nsystem in New Zealand will be found discussed in the _Westminster\r\nReview_ for January, 1910. There is an appeal to the courts from the\r\nrate of wages fixed by such commission; and it appears that out\r\nof four such appeals, in three the decision of the commission was\r\nconfirmed, and in the fourth set aside; but the workingmen disregarded\r\nthe judgment of the court and struck for a higher wage--contrary to\r\nthe whole theory of such legislation, which is to _prevent_ strikes.\r\nThis strike succeeding, there has, therefore, been no case so far\r\nwhere the increasing rate of wages was checked by any appeal to the\r\ncourts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So. Australia, 1906, no. 915; 1900, no. 752; Victoria,\r\n1903, no. 1,857; 1905, no. 2,008.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See New Zealand Law of 1900, no. 51; frequently amended\r\nsince.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: 60 and 61 Victoria, c. 37, 9 Edward VII.]\r\n\r\nIn the British Parliament last year (and the identical bill has\r\nbeen introduced in the State of New York under championship of the\r\nConsumers League, as applied to women and children), a bill was\r\nintroduced,[1] not backed, however, by the government as such,\r\nalthough bearing the name of Lloyd-George, providing in effect that\r\nwages might be fixed in this manner in certain definite named trades,\r\nand also in such other trades as might be designated from time to time\r\nby the home secretary. The economic effect of such measures we are not\r\nto discuss. In the United States, except as to public work, they would\r\nbe probably unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Since enacted, see below in chap. XI.]\r\n\r\nComing, therefore, to public work, we use this phrase for all labor\r\ncontributed directly to the State, to any county, city, town, village,\r\nor municipality thereof, to any municipal-owned public-service\r\ncorporation, gas, water, etc., company, or, finally, and most\r\nimportant, to or under any contractor for the same, or any of them.\r\nSome years ago the State of New York adopted legislation to the effect\r\nthat in all such public employment the wages paid should be the usual\r\nrate paid for similar work in the same locality at the same time. As\r\na result of this legislation, many thousands of lawsuits were brought\r\nagainst the City of New York by persons who had done labor for that\r\nmunicipality in the past, complaining that they had not in fact been\r\npaid \"the prevailing rate,\" although in fact the work had long since\r\nterminated, and they had been discharged, paid in full, and apparently\r\nsatisfied. Shortly after, the law itself was declared unconstitutional\r\nby New York courts. Thereupon the labor interests proposed a\r\nconstitutional amendment in 1905, to the effect that \"the legislature\r\nmay regulate and fix the wages or salaries, the hours of work or\r\nlabor, and make provision for the protection, safety, and welfare of\r\npersons employed by the State or by any county, city, town, village,\r\nor other civil subdivision of the State, or by any contractor or\r\nsubcontractor performing work, labor, or services for the State or for\r\nany city, county, town, village, or other civil division thereof.\" A\r\nvery small proportion of the voters of New York took the trouble to\r\nvote upon this amendment, although it revolutionized the economic, if\r\nnot the constitutional, system of the State, so far as property and\r\ncontract rights are concerned; and it was adopted by a substantial\r\nmajority. In Indiana there was a statute at one time fixing the rate\r\nof wages in public employment at a minimum of not less than fifteen\r\ncents per hour, but it was held unconstitutional. It is customary in\r\nNew England villages to vote annually that the town shall pay its\r\nunskilled labor a prescribed rate for the following year, usually two\r\ndollars per day. The effect of this has been sometimes to cause the\r\ndischarge of all but the very most skilful and able-bodied; of those\r\nwho had, by working at less than full pay, been kept out of the\r\npoorhouse; and the selectmen of some towns, notably Plymouth, have\r\nrefused to obey such a vote. The California Code of 1906 provides a\r\nminimum compensation of two dollars per day for public labor, except\r\nas to persons regularly employed in public institutions. Delaware has\r\ncopied the New York statute as to the prevailing rate. Hawaii, in\r\npublic labor, provides a minimum wage of one dollar and twenty-five\r\ncents per day. Nebraska goes further, and provides not only for two\r\ndollars per day for public work, but that it must be done by union\r\nlabor in cities of the first class, while Nevada has a minimum wage\r\nof three dollars and an eight-hour day for unskilled labor in public\r\nwork. On the other hand, the Constitution of Louisiana prescribes that\r\nno law shall ever be passed fixing the price of manual labor.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This matter will be found further discussed in chap. XI.]\r\n\r\nComing lastly to _tolls_, or rates of persons or corporations enjoying\r\na franchise, that is to say, a legalized monopoly, or exclusive\r\nlegislation, or special privilege, such as eminent domain, or the\r\nright to occupy the streets; such are, in fact, identical with what we\r\nterm public-service corporations, the older, the most universal, and\r\ncertainly the most, if not the only, justifiable example of legal\r\nregulation of the returns for the use of property or personal\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the economic wisdom of attempting to\r\nregulate any rate or prices by law (and for a discussion of this\r\nsubject as to railways, at least, the reader may well be referred\r\nto the valuable treatise of Mr. Hugo R. Meyer, \"State Regulation of\r\nRailways\"), such legislation was at least in England constitutional;\r\nbut in this country, owing to our specific adoption of the principle\r\nof property rights and freedom of labor and hence of freedom of\r\ncontract in our Federal and State constitutions, and as it has been\r\nrepeatedly decided that to take away the income from property or a\r\nreasonable return for labor by legislation is to infringe on the\r\nproperty or liberty right itself, we have a universally recognized\r\nconstitutional objection which has, in fact, made impossible all\r\nregulation of prices and wages, except as above mentioned, and as we\r\nare now about to discuss. The first attempt to regulate rates (with\r\nthe possible exception of some early colonial laws) was the so-called\r\nGranger legislation, as shown in the Illinois Constitution of 1870,\r\nauthorizing a warehouse commission to fix charges for elevating grain,\r\nthe Act of Iowa of 1874 establishing reasonable maximum rates for\r\nrailways, a similar act in Wisconsin of the same year relating to\r\nrailroad, express, and telegraph companies, and in Minnesota; which\r\nlegislation was all sustained by a divided opinion in the so-called\r\nGranger cases headed by Munn _v._ Illinois, 94 U.S. 113.\r\n\r\nIn the many years which have elapsed since this famous decision, the\r\nclouds have rolled away and the shape and basis of that apex of our\r\njurisprudence been fairly surveyed. It will appear, I think, to any\r\ndispassionate jurist to have been rightly decided, at least as to\r\nthe railroads, though the reasons given by Chief Justice Waite are\r\nunsatisfactory and have little logical basis. The true basis of\r\nregulation of rates at the common law and in English history was\r\n_monopoly_; either a franchise directly granted by the crown, such as\r\na bridge, ferry, or dock, or one which was geographically, at least,\r\nexclusive, like a dock without a franchise. As Lord Ellenborough said\r\nin the decision quoted by the Chief Justice himself: \"Every man may\r\nfix what price he pleases upon his own property, or the use of it; but\r\nif for a particular purpose the public have a right to resort to his\r\npremises and make use of them, and he have a monopoly in them for that\r\npurpose, if he will take the benefit of that monopoly, he must, as an\r\nequivalent, perform the duty attached to it on reasonable terms.\" \"_If\r\nfor a particular purpose the public have a right to resort to his\r\npremises_\"--this important qualification from now on seems to have\r\nbeen lost sight of in the majority opinion. Quoting the early\r\nprecedents such as that statute of William and Mary regulating the\r\ncharges of common carriers--and our readers will remember many\r\nmore--and the case of cabmen whose charges are regulated by city\r\nordinances--but they are given stands or exclusive privileges in the\r\nstreets--the chief justice concluded with the startling proposition\r\nthat \"if they do not wish to submit themselves to such interference,\r\nthey should not have clothed the public with an interest in their\r\nconcerns.\" But the public has an interest, as was afterward pointed\r\nout in dissenting opinions, in the price of shoes; yet it has never\r\nbeen supposed that that gave any power of legal regulation of factory\r\nprices. A still stronger case is that of inns or hotels, which have\r\nalways been \"a public avocation.\" They have had to take in all\r\ntravellers without discrimination; yet there is not a vestige of\r\nlegislation in the English statute-book regulating the prices to be\r\ncharged by hotels. Indeed in early times most employments--millers,\r\nbarbers, bakers--were public in the sense that the man could not\r\nrefuse a job; yet their prices were never regulated. Yet it was upon\r\nthis phrase, \"_public employment_\" or \"_private property affected with\r\na public interest_,\" taken from the opinion of Justice LeBlanc in the\r\nLondon Dock Company case, decided in 1810, without its context, that\r\nthe chief justice built up the whole reason of his decision. The\r\n_decision_ in Munn _v._ Illinois, subject to court review as to\r\nwhether the rate be confiscatory, remains good law, but the _opinion_\r\nis still open to question; and indeed the most recent decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court show a desire to get away from it.\r\n\r\nSome writers endeavor to justify, under our constitutions, the\r\nregulation of rates by the principle of eminent domain; but this\r\nsource seems far-fetched and unnecessary. It is, of course, done under\r\nthe police power; but the precedent for that use of the police power\r\nis to be found in the history of English law and statutes. Thus we\r\nhave noted in the Statute of Westminster I, A.D. 1275, that excessive\r\ntoll contrary to the common custom of the realm was forbidden in\r\nmarket towns. The very phraseology of this statute indicates the\r\nantiquity of the doctrine that tolls must be reasonable; but \"toll\"\r\nwas always a technical term, not for ordinary prices of commodities,\r\nbut for a use or service which was in some way dependent upon law or\r\nordinance. In the very opinion of Chief Justice Waite, he quotes Lord\r\nHale, saying that the king \"has a right of franchise or privilege,\r\nthat no man may set up a common ferry without a prescription time out\r\nof mind, or a charter from the king,\" and so later he quotes Lord Hale\r\nas saying that the same principle applies to a public wharf \"because\r\nthey are the wharves only licensed by the king.\" We also found\r\nlegislation fixing rents and so on in staple towns, and consequently\r\nof the charges of property owners therein, such towns having grant of\r\na special privilege. The early law books are full of cases showing\r\nthat discrimination and extortion were unlawful, even criminal,\r\noffences. And finally, as Chief Justice Waite points out, we find the\r\nrates of carriers fixed by law in 1691. Ordinary carriers, not having\r\nthe right of eminent domain such as express companies, might to-day be\r\nconsidered to have no legal monopoly, and indeed, possibly for that\r\nreason, the regulation of charges of express companies has not yet\r\nbeen attempted; but in King William's time it was doubtless considered\r\nthat the carriers had special privileges on the highways, as indeed\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, therefore, that the real reason, both logical and\r\nhistorical, for regulation of rates rests on the fact that the person\r\nor corporation so regulated is given a monopoly or franchise by some\r\nlaw or ordinance, or at least a special privilege from the State; or\r\nat least that he maintains a wharf, a bridge, or a ferry, or\r\nother avocation which (really for the same reason) has, from time\r\nimmemorial, been subject to such regulation. This, indeed, has been\r\nthe doctrine officially adopted by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts\r\nin its legislation--\"Where monopoly is permitted, State regulation\r\nis necessary.\" The new \"Business\" Corporation Act of 1903 makes the\r\nexpress distinction between public-service corporations and all other\r\nprivate corporations for gain: it applies to \"all corporations ...\r\nestablished for the purpose of carrying on business for profit ... but\r\nnot to ... railroad or street railway company, telegraph or telephone\r\ncompany, gas or electric light, heat or power company, canal, aqueduct\r\nor water company, cemetery or crematory company, or to any other\r\ncorporations which now have or may hereafter have the right to take or\r\ncondemn land or to exercise franchises in public ways granted by the\r\ncommonwealth or by any county, city, or town.\" The implication is that\r\nsuch other corporations are not given the entire freedom of action and\r\ncontract conferred by this Business Corporation Act. Where the State\r\ncreates a monopoly, it puts the public at the mercy of the grantee\r\nof that franchise. Therefore, it is logical and just that it should\r\nregulate the rates. The test, however, is not and cannot be, that the\r\nman is ready to serve all comers, or even that he is compelled so to\r\ndo; hotel-keepers, barbers, restaurants, doctors, etc., have never\r\nhad their charges regulated by law. In early days most tradesmen were\r\ncompelled to serve any and all, at an equal price, under liability\r\nfor damages.[1] Mills, indeed, have always been subject to have their\r\ntolls regulated; at least, a certain proportion of the grist had to go\r\nto the miller; but even if it be held they had no peculiar franchise,\r\nthe exception is as old as the rule.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Holmes J., _ex banco_, in United States _v_. Standard Oil\r\nCo., March 14, 1910.]\r\n\r\nIt is further noteworthy that since the Granger cases themselves,\r\nthere has been no extension of the doctrine of Chief Justice Waite to\r\nother trades or industries, while the extent of the doctrine, that is,\r\nthe amount of regulation permissible under the Constitution, has\r\nbeen very much limited. Waite's opinion gives no intimation of any\r\nconstitutional limit whatever, but dozens of the decisions of\r\nthe Supreme Court since draw the limit this side of the point of\r\nconfiscation; that is to say, at a \"reasonable return,\" whatever that\r\nphrase may mean. It was, indeed, at first extended to semi-private\r\ngrain elevators on the prairies, to elevators monopolizing the water\r\nfront of Buffalo, New York, and to floating elevators in New York\r\nHarbor, the first and last of which show certainly no element of legal\r\nmonopoly, while the Buffalo case at most only a geographical one.\r\nStill, elevators were the subject of Munn _v_. Illinois itself.[1] And\r\nit has never been extended to a mere _de facto_ or \"virtual\" monopoly\r\narising only from the accident of trade. Moreover, in matters of\r\ninterstate commerce, although it might have been argued that such\r\naffairs were left absolutely to the plenary power of Congress, which\r\nmight well, if it chose, pass laws preventing any railroad from\r\nengaging in interstate business, except at a certain rate per mile for\r\npassengers or freight--or that no vessel should be allowed to carry\r\npassengers or freight from foreign countries except at a certain price\r\nper head or per ton--yet the Supreme Court seems to have held that\r\neven this plenary power over commerce expressly given to Congress in\r\nthe Constitution, is limited by the ordinary property guarantees of\r\nthat instrument; possibly because the Fifth Amendment is of later date\r\nthan the body of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: We may divide monopolies into legal, geographical, and\r\n_de facto_, or \"virtual\" monopolies--phrases which sufficiently\r\ndescribe themselves.]\r\n\r\nWe thus find that the earliest legislation regulating rates was that\r\nof the States. It was thirteen years after the Iowa statute above\r\nreferred to that the Interstate Commerce Act was passed, which was\r\nsupposed to give a power--afterward denied by our Supreme Court--to\r\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission to fix rates. It certainly did give\r\nthem power to find, upon complaint, what was a reasonable rate, which\r\nwas _prima facie_ evidence in case of appeal. In hundreds of cases\r\nactual rates were complained of, in probably many more discrimination\r\nwas complained of, and, according to Mr. Meyer, the commission was\r\nfound by the Supreme Court to have decided rightly about half the\r\ntime. In 1903 came the intelligent Elkins Bill against discrimination,\r\nwhich merely re-enacts the common law, and up to within two or three\r\nyears has proved the only really effective measure of controlling the\r\nrates themselves. In 1906 came the Hepburn Act under Roosevelt, giving\r\ngeneral power to the commission to fix rates upon complaint, to make\r\njoint rates, extending the statute to the oil pipe-lines, express\r\ncompanies, and sleeping-car companies, and going to the verge of\r\nthe Constitution in an effort to provide that rates fixed by the\r\ncommission should take immediate effect. So far as most recent\r\ndecisions go, however, this great statute has not altered the position\r\nof the Supreme Court of the United States as to the constitutional\r\nnecessity of a reasonable return to the carrier, and perhaps the\r\ncardinal question remains to be decided, whether such rate-making\r\npower is legislative, and, if so, may under the Federal Constitution\r\nbe delegated by Congress to any board. Congress merely proclaims that\r\nthe rates shall be reasonable and without discrimination--both mere\r\nexpressions of the common law--and leaves the determination of what is\r\nreasonable between the Interstate Commerce Commission and the Supreme\r\nCourt, neither of them legislative bodies. The common law may, indeed,\r\nbe decided by a judicial body; but it is difficult to see why the\r\nalteration of the common law is not legislation. And this criticism\r\napplies _a fortiori_ to the Taft Bill just enacted (June, 1910), which\r\ngives the Interstate Commerce Commission power to fix rates of their\r\nown motion. When, therefore--if the author may venture to repeat his\r\nwords--the commission fix a \"just and reasonable\" rate,[1] if they are\r\napplying the common law, their act is judicial; if they are fixing\r\nother standards, it is legislative.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: United States Act of February 4, 1887, as amended June\r\n29, 1906, sec. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Stimson's \"Federal and State Constitutions of the United\r\nStates,\" p. 53.]\r\n\r\nComing to the States again, this constitutional difficulty does not\r\nconcern us, for it has been decided that the division of powers into\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial must, as to the States, be\r\nexpressly provided in the State constitutions and is not guaranteed\r\nunder the Fourteenth Amendment. Broadly speaking, the history of\r\nlegislation has been as follows: The States have usually exercised\r\ntheir rate-making power through a railroad or corporation commission.\r\nNew York and Virginia now employ the more comprehensive phrase \"public\r\nservice\" or \"corporation\" commission. The Massachusetts statute, like\r\nthe Granger statutes, dates from 1874. Just as we found in the Middle\r\nAges in the case of the Black Death in times of famine, so times of\r\npanic with us have always produced radical legislation: this, it\r\nwill be noted, is the year after the great panic of 1873. But the\r\nMassachusetts law, the earliest of all, did not and does not authorize\r\nany fixing of rates, or even any finding as to what was reasonable\r\nupon rates. It extends only to the other conditions of service. The\r\nstatute is, perhaps, broad enough to permit such a finding as matter\r\nof opinion; but it would have no legal effect. The commission, section\r\n15, were authorized to find that a change in rates of fares for\r\ntransporting freight or passengers was reasonable and expedient, and\r\nso inform the corporation and the public, through their annual report.\r\nAll the Western States, however, did give such power.\r\n\r\nAs has been said, no constitutional objection has been sustained by\r\nthe United States Court as to this delegation of power, if it be one;\r\nbut in later years, possibly dissatisfied with the conservatism of\r\nsuch boards, we find drastic legislation, particularly in the West\r\nand South, fixing maximum rates, at least as to passengers (it is\r\nobviously difficult, if not impossible, to enact express legislation\r\nas to freight rates). Such legislation stands in as strong (or\r\nstronger) constitutional position, as rates made by the commission;\r\nand only fails when \"confiscatory\" or when in conflict with Federal\r\nlegislation. Perhaps the most notable clash between the States and the\r\nFederal power has been on this subject in this very last year, where\r\nState laws have been annulled and even high State officers enforcing\r\nthem restrained by injunction of Federal courts. Still, in the\r\nlegislation of all States, I find as yet none overstepping the limits\r\nwe have above defined as proper.\r\n\r\nThe question of the _amount_ of return required by the court is, of\r\ncourse, a most important one. It is a difficult subject, because no\r\nfixed rule takes any account of risk to the original investment. It is\r\nall very well to say that six or eight per cent, is a fair return on\r\ninvested capital, or even on \"cost of reproduction\"; but when, as to\r\noriginal promoters, the chance of even any return was as one against\r\nten of a total loss, _fifty_ per cent. of annual profit would not\r\nbe more than a \"fair return\"! The original Massachusetts railway\r\nlegislation seems to contemplate that ten per cent. should be the\r\nnormal return on railway stock, for it provides that at any time the\r\ncommonwealth may purchase any or all its railroads upon the payment of\r\nthe cost, plus ten per cent. a year profit.\r\n\r\nOther than in railroads, the main fixing of rates has been in\r\nilluminating gas. Many cities are permitted to legislate on this\r\npoint. In New York it was decided that they might so do, provided the\r\ngas company got a fair return on its capital, not including the value\r\nof its franchise; and certainly it would seem to be the height of\r\naudacity to claim more. Much as if a boy, presented by his father with\r\nhens and the feed to support them, were to demand the capitalization\r\nof the value of all future eggs upon going out of business! In\r\nBoston, intelligent legislation was adopted--based on good mediaeval\r\nprinciples--which allows dividends at a sliding scale according to the\r\nprice of gas to the consumer.[1] The great reason, of course, of the\r\ncessation of legislative activity on the part of the States, as to\r\nrailway rates, has been that the great bulk of rates appertained to\r\ninterstate commerce, or at least must be controlled by the rates of\r\ninterstate commerce; so only legislation as to strictly local rates\r\nremains.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It will be remembered that the very earliest Statute of\r\nBread and Ale (1266) established such a sliding scale.]\r\n\r\nThe two most important questions, aside from that of an actual\r\nextortionate rate (which has hardly ever been claimed) are that of\r\ndiscrimination, and of the long-and-short-haul clause, which is really\r\na derivative of the former. We have found the principle against\r\ndiscrimination time-honored in the common law; but modern statutes\r\nwisely recognize that discrimination only exists when two persons\r\nor two localities are given different rates _under equivalent\r\ncircumstances._ There has, therefore, been great dispute what these\r\nwords, \"similar circumstances and conditions,\" in the Federal law may\r\nmean. There is no doubt that actual differences in cost of service\r\nmake dissimilar conditions; but does geographical situation, such as\r\nis recognized in the long-and-short-haul clause? or still more, the\r\namount of business offering, or the amount of possible competition?\r\nVery early the Interstate Commerce Commission and our legislation got\r\nto the point of recognizing competition by water; but the competition\r\nof other railroads was a thing harder to recognize. Many people\r\nthink they have a right to a fairly equivalent service at a fairly\r\nequivalent cost throughout the United States, and that they have\r\na right to all the advantages of their geographical position. The\r\nfarmers in Westchester County, about New York, thought they had\r\nundoubted reason to complain when the rates on milk were made the same\r\nfrom their farms to the city as from farms in Ohio; pointing out,\r\nindeed, that they had bought their farms originally, and paid high\r\nprices for the land, for the very reason of its geographical situation\r\nclose to a great market. Yet in our courts the economic rule has\r\nusually prevailed; although no legislation, so far as I have found,\r\nrecognizes such differences, except under some vague expression such\r\nas service or discrimination \"under like or similar conditions.\"\r\nWhether legislation will ever come to the point of recognizing the\r\nrailroad man's shibboleth, \"charge what the traffic will bear,\" is\r\nperhaps dubious. And the new Taft Act, in its long-and-short-haul\r\nprovision, takes a long step in the direction of geographical\r\nuniformity and rigidity of rates.\r\n\r\nA few examples of modern rate regulation may be given. In 1896 South\r\nCarolina fixed a flat passenger rate of three and one-quarter cents\r\nper mile. Both South Carolina and Virginia have empowered the railway\r\nor public service commission to fix all rates, including telephone and\r\ntelegraph. Passenger rates are now usually fixed at two cents per mile\r\nin the East, or at two and one-half cents in the South or West. In\r\n1907 Kansas and Nebraska arbitrarily reduced all freight rates fifteen\r\nper cent. on the price then charged. In 1907 there was some evidence\r\nof reaction; Alabama, in an extra session, repealed her law enacted\r\nthe same year prescribing maximum freight rates, substituting more\r\nmoderate rates in seven \"groups\" (which, however, may be changed by\r\nthe railway commission!), and also enacted a statute directing the\r\ncommission and the attorney-general not to enforce the earlier law;\r\nwhile the heavily penal Minnesota law was declared unconstitutional by\r\nthe United States Supreme Court. In the British empire the power to\r\nfix rates is, of course, unquestioned; and they are, as to railways\r\nat least, generally regulated by law. Canada in 1903 established\r\na railroad commission, and Nova Scotia in 1908 imposed various\r\nrestrictions as to tolls, still the English word for rates. So in\r\nOntario and Quebec in 1906, and in Tasmania in 1901. In many States,\r\nsuch as Victoria, the railways are owned by the state, in which case,\r\nof course, no question as to the right to fix rates can arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTRUSTS AND MONOPOLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nLegislation against combinations of properties to bring about\r\nmonopoly, or contracts in restraint of trade, is the last field of\r\nlegislation we have to consider in connection with property, and\r\npossibly in the public mind the most important. Although the law\r\nagainst combinations of laborers rests upon much the same principles,\r\nit is perhaps best to give a special chapter to combinations of\r\nproperty, leaving labor combinations to be treated in that special\r\nconnection. The matter has been written up so voluminously that it\r\nmight be difficult to say anything new upon the subject, yet for that\r\nvery reason it may be as well to analyze it into its simplest elements\r\nat the common law, and then trace its recent development in our\r\nsomewhat unintelligent statute-making. At common law, then, these\r\nobnoxious acts may be analyzed into five definite heads: forestalling,\r\nregrating, and engrossing--which have been thoroughly defined in an\r\nearlier chapter and the modern form of which in modern language might\r\nbe called restraining production or fixing prices, the buying\r\nand selling of futures or gambling contracts, and cornering the\r\nmarket--restraint of trade, and monopoly. The broad principles,\r\nhowever, upon which the gravamen of even these first three rests, is\r\nrestraint of trade, which was always obnoxious at the common law.\r\nContracts in restraint of trade, except such reasonable contracts as\r\npartnership, or the sale of a business with condition not to engage in\r\nthe same trade in a certain limited locality or for a certain, limited\r\ntime, have always been void at the common law. They are not, however,\r\ncriminal except by statute, though a combination in restraint of\r\ntrade, etc., was always so. We found many such statutes as we also\r\nfound laws which gave a penalty in double or treble damages to the\r\nperson injured by such combination or contract. The great case of\r\nmonopolies, reported in full in the seventh volume of the State\r\nTrials, is a perfect mine of information on this subject, having been\r\nargued many months at great length by the greatest lawyers, three of\r\nwhom later were chief-justices of England. This is not the case of\r\nthe playing cards, Darcy's case, commonly called the \"Monopoly Case,\"\r\nwhich is briefly reported in Coke and covers a far narrower subject,\r\nthe royal grant for a monopoly in the importation (not manufacture or\r\nsale) of playing cards, presumably because Coke's reports are far more\r\naccessible than the somewhat rare editions of the State Trials; but\r\nthe great case brought by the British East India Company against one\r\nSandys, the loss of which would have forfeited its charter and its\r\nbusiness, and possibly put an end to British dominion in the East.\r\nIts charter dated from the early years of Charles II and the 43d\r\nElizabeth. It brought suit against the defendant, who freighted a\r\nvessel to East Indian ports. Mention in it is made of a charter to the\r\nMuscovy Company as early as Philip and Mary, a much earlier date than\r\nis elsewhere assigned to trading corporations. Hundreds of cases of\r\nunlawful monopolies are cited, among them the case of the tailors of\r\nNorwich, where a combination to work only for certain wages and to\r\nadvise others not to work for less and to prevent such others from\r\ngetting employment with their own employer, was held a conspiracy and\r\nan attempt to gain a monopoly at the common law. Another case, of one\r\nPeachy, who had by royal grant an exclusive right to sell sweet wine\r\nin London, was held to disclose an odious monopoly at common law and\r\nthe king's franchise void.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the writer, had this common law been thoroughly\r\nremembered and understood by our bench and bar, to say nothing of our\r\nlegislatures, very little anti-trust legislation by the States\r\nwould have been necessary except, again, of course, to affix modern\r\npenalties to such offences. There has, however, been a vast amount\r\nof such legislation. In so far as such legislation has embodied the\r\ncommon law, it has stood the test of the courts and been of some value\r\nin repressing objectionable trusts or contracts. In so far as it has\r\ngone beyond the common law, it has often proved futile and still more\r\noften been declared unconstitutional by the courts.\r\n\r\nTo the five principles of the common law set forth above we have,\r\nperhaps, added two new ones. Besides fixing prices, limiting outputs,\r\ncornering the market, contracting in restraint of trade, and acting or\r\ncontracting with the purpose of gaining a monopoly--all of which were\r\nobjectionable at common law--we have legislated in some States against\r\nthe securing of discriminatory railway rates for the purpose of\r\nestablishing a monopoly, and against what we have termed \"unfair\r\ncompetition\"--that being generally defined to be the making of an\r\nartificially low price in a certain locality for the purpose of\r\ndestroying a competitor, or the making of exclusive contracts; that is\r\nto say, refusing to deal with a person unless he binds himself not to\r\ndeal with anybody else. This last thing can hardly, however, be said\r\nto add to common-law principles. Nevertheless, some of the newer State\r\nanti-trust statutes prescribe it so definitely that it may be treated\r\nas a modern invention.\r\n\r\nAll this legislation is extremely recent. In the writer's digest of\r\n\"American Statute Law,\" published in 1886, I find no mention of trusts\r\nin this modern sense, though a special chapter is given to them in\r\nvolume II, published in 1892. The first legal writing in which the\r\nword was used and the rise of the thing itself adverted to is, so\r\nfar as I know, a contribution to the _Harvard Law Review_, entitled\r\nTrusts, vol. I, page 132; but the trust then had in mind was the\r\nsimple early form of the railway equipment trust said to have been\r\ninvented in Pennsylvania, which was indeed copied in the first\r\nagreement, so long kept secret, of the Standard Oil Trust; and also\r\nthe corporate stock trust, that is to say, the practice then beginning\r\nof persuading stockholders to intrust a majority of the capital stock\r\nof the corporation into the hands of trustees, receiving in return\r\ntherefor trust certificates, with a claim to the net earnings of the\r\ncorporation, but without real voting power; and there are cases in\r\nwhich such trusts were sought to be held invalid and enjoined in\r\nequity, sometimes with and sometimes without success.\r\n\r\nBefore going into the details of anti-trust legislation, it would be\r\nwell to sketch its history on the broadest possible lines. Legislation\r\nbegan first in the States some years before the Federal Anti-trust\r\nLaw, or Sherman Act, first enacted in 1890. These earlier statutes,\r\nincluding the Sherman Act itself, made illegal all contracts or\r\ncombinations between persons or corporations in restraint of trade;\r\nand their direct result was to compel the formation of the gigantic\r\nmodern trust as we now understand it. Had the Sherman Act, instead of\r\nbeing called \"An Act to Protect Trade and Commerce Against Unlawful\r\nRestraints and Monopolies,\" been entitled \"An Act to Compel the\r\nFormation of Large Trusts by all Persons Engaged in Similar Lines of\r\nBusiness,\" it would have been far more correctly described in its\r\ntitle. For whereas, before this act persons or corporations could make\r\ncontracts or arrangements among themselves which were good and valid\r\nworking agreements unless so clearly monopolistic as to be held\r\nunreasonable restraint of trade at the common law (which, indeed,\r\nso far as I know, was never done in any American court), after\r\nthe Sherman Act was passed all such contracts, combinations, or\r\narrangements, even when reasonable and proper, were made illegal and\r\ncriminal. The only escape, therefore, was to bring all such persons\r\nand corporations in the same trade together in one corporation, and\r\nthis is precisely what we now term a trust. Before 1890, in other\r\nwords, a trust was really an agreement, a combination of individuals\r\nor corporations usually resting upon an actual deed of trust under\r\nwhich the constituent parties surrendered their property or the\r\ncontrol of their property to a central board of trustees; since 1890\r\nthis kind of trust has practically disappeared and been replaced by\r\nthe single large corporation, either a holding company which holds\r\nthe stock of all constituent companies, or under still more modern\r\npractice, because more likely to stand the scrutiny of the courts,\r\na huge corporation, with a charter given by the liberal laws of New\r\nJersey, West Virginia, or other State, which actually holds, directly,\r\nall the properties and business of the constituent corporations\r\nor persons. The modern question, therefore, has become really the\r\nquestion of the large corporation, its regulation and its control;\r\nfurther complicated, of course, by the fact that hitherto there has\r\nbeen no power to control such large corporations except the very State\r\nwhich creates them, which is usually quite indifferent to their acts\r\nso long as they pay the corporation tax. It is therefore a question\r\nnot only of the large corporation, but of the powers of the States\r\nover each other's corporations and of the Federal government over all.\r\nUntil the Northern Securities case, it was probably supposed that a\r\ncorporation, being an individual, could not be guilty of a criminal\r\nconspiracy, and consequently could not in itself offend against the\r\nanti-trust acts. That case, and more recent decisions still, show a\r\ndisposition of the courts to look behind the screen of the fictitious\r\nentity of the corporation to the merits and demerits of the persons\r\nmaking it up, and the objects with which they came together and the\r\nmethods they continued to use.\r\n\r\nThe Federal statute was indeed necessary to this extent, that,\r\nalthough the common law was unquestioned, as there is no Federal\r\ncommon law in the absence of statute, and as interstate commerce\r\ncannot be controlled by State law, either common or statute, it was\r\nnecessary for Congress to declare that the principles of the common\r\nlaw should apply to interstate commerce. It was also doubtless wise to\r\nremind the public of the existence of this body of law and to affix\r\ndefinite prohibitions and penalties. To this extent the anti-trust\r\nlegislation, both State and Federal, is fully justified. Nevertheless,\r\nit is noteworthy that the older States, where both the legislatures\r\nand the bar had presumably a higher degree of legal education, rarely\r\nfound it necessary to enact statutes against trusts. There has\r\nnever been, for instance, any anti-trust law in Massachusetts or in\r\nPennsylvania, or for a long time in New York, for the first statute\r\nof that State against trusts was made intentionally futile by being\r\napplied only to a trust which secured a complete--_i.e._, one hundred\r\nper cent.--monopoly of its trade.\r\n\r\nThe economic consideration of all such legislation we do not propose\r\nto consider; whether it was wise to forbid all forestalling, for\r\ninstance--which at the common law meant buying at a definite distance\r\nas well as at a distant time; that is to say, a person who bought\r\nall the leather in Cordova was guilty of forestalling as well as the\r\nperson who bought all the sherry that was to be made in Spain in the\r\nensuing year--what we call the buying of futures. This is certainly\r\nvery unpopular, and we find most of our States legislating against it;\r\nyet, of course, many economists argue that it is only by allowing\r\nsuch contracts that the price of any article can be made stable and a\r\nsupply stored in years of plenty against years of famine. The first\r\nhistorical example of forestalling and engrossing is to be found in\r\nthe book of Genesis. Joseph was not, I believe, a regrator, but he\r\nwas one of the most successful forestallers and engrossers that ever\r\nexisted, and made a most successful corner in corn in Egypt; and his\r\ncase is cited as a precedent in the Great Case of Monopolies above\r\nmentioned. James C. Carter tells us[1] that all these laws are\r\ncontrary to modern principles and were repealed a century ago. I\r\ncannot find that such is the case. On the contrary, they were made\r\nperpetual in the thirteenth year of Elizabeth, and we find perfectly\r\n_modern_ trust legislation as early as Edward I, in 1285. In 1892 I\r\nfind legislation already in nineteen States and Territories; North\r\nDakota, indeed, having already a constitutional provision. Three\r\nStates at least, Kansas, Michigan, and Nebraska, seem to have been\r\nbefore the Federal Act, their laws dating from 1889; while several\r\nStates have statutes in 1890, the year in which the Sherman Act was\r\nenacted. There has hardly a year passed since without a good many\r\nstatutes aimed against trusts, though they have shown a tendency\r\nto decrease of late years, and it is especially noticeable that\r\nanti-trust legislation is apt to cease entirely in the years following\r\na panic, as if legislatures had learned the lesson that too much\r\ninterference is destructive of business prosperity; I find that by\r\n1908 just about half the States had embodied a prohibition of trusts\r\nin their organic law.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"Law, Its Origin, History, and Function,\" N.Y., 1907.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: These provisions will be found digested in the writer's\r\n\"Federal and State Constitutions,\" pp. 339-341.]\r\n\r\nOne of the principal earlier objects of the trust was to evade the\r\ncorporation law. To-day they specially aim at becoming a legal\r\ncorporation. In like manner their earliest object and desire was to\r\nescape all Federal supervision and interference by legislation or\r\notherwise; to-day they are desirous of such regulation under Federal\r\ncharters, for the purpose of escaping the more multifarious and\r\nradical law-making of the forty-six different States. Before the\r\nIndustrial Commission in 1897-1900, all the heads of the great\r\n\"trusts\"--Rockefeller, Archbold, Havemeyer--testified in favor of\r\nFederal incorporation; almost all other witnesses, except one or two\r\nNew York or New Jersey corporation lawyers, against it.\r\n\r\nIn the article in the _Harvard Law Review_, above referred to, the\r\nwriter suggested that the evil might be cured by compelling trusts to\r\norganize as corporations, thereby bringing them under the regulation\r\nand control that the State exercises over corporations. That has come\r\nto pass, but the remedy has not seemed adequate. In the early Sugar\r\nTrust case, the New York Supreme Court decided that combinations to\r\nsell through a common agent, thereby, of course, fixing the price,\r\nwith other common devices for controlling the market and preventing\r\ncompetition, were illegal at the common law; and also that a\r\ncorporation which, in order to bring about such a combination, put\r\nall its stock in the hands of trustees or a holding company, thereby\r\nforfeited its charter, the only result of which decision was to drive\r\nthe Sugar Trust from its New York charters to a legal organization in\r\nthe State of New Jersey. It is noteworthy that one or two of the\r\nmost obvious remedies for this condition of things have never been\r\nemployed, possibly because they would be too effective. That is to\r\nsay, there might be legislation that a corporation should not act out\r\nof the State chartering it--that a New Jersey corporation, holding no\r\nproperty and doing no business in New Jersey, should not be used to\r\ncarry on business in New York. We also might have legislated, going\r\nback to the strict principles of the common law, to forbid any\r\ncorporation, any artificial body, from holding shares in another\r\ncorporation. It is doubtful, to-day, whether this can be done under\r\nthe common law, and the authors of the Massachusetts corporation law\r\nrefused expressly to provide for it; on the other hand the proposed\r\nFederal Incorporation Act expressly validates it. We do, however,\r\nbegin to see some legislation on this line of approach, notably in the\r\ncase of competing companies, several Western States at least having\r\nstatutes forbidding a corporation from holding stock in such\r\ncompanies; and it was one of the recommendations of President Taft's\r\nrecent message, at least as to railroad companies not holding half of\r\nsuch stock.\r\n\r\nIt will well repay us now to make a careful study of all these\r\nanti-trust statutes, for the purpose of seeing whether they have\r\nintroduced any new principles into the law, and also in what manner\r\nthey express the old. Up to two or three years ago one might have said\r\nthat not a single case had been decided in the courts of any State or\r\nof the Federal government against trusts or combinations, which might\r\nnot have been decided the same way under common-law principles had\r\nthere been no anti-trust legislation whatever. As is well known, the\r\ngreat exception to this statement is the interpretation of the Federal\r\nAct by the Supreme Court of the United States, declaring that any\r\ncontract in restraint of trade was unlawful under it, although it\r\nwould have been reasonable and proper at the common law. Later\r\nindications are, as President Taft has said, that the courts will see\r\na way to modify this somewhat extravagant position by reintroducing\r\nthe common-law test, viz.: Whether the contract is done with the\r\n_purport_ (or effect) of making a monopoly for destroying competition,\r\nor whether such result is trivial and incidental to a reasonable and\r\nlawful business arrangement. The earliest statutes, those of Michigan,\r\nKansas, and Nebraska, in 1889, denounce the following principles:\r\n\"All contracts, agreements, understandings, and combinations ... the\r\n_purpose_ or object of which shall be to limit or control the output,\r\nto enhance or regulate the price, to prevent or restrict free\r\ncompetition in production or sale.\" This, the Michigan statute, merely\r\nstates the common law, but goes on to declare such contract, etc., a\r\ncriminal conspiracy, and any act done as part thereof, a misdemeanor,\r\nand, in the case of a corporation, subjects it to forfeiture of its\r\ncharter. The law makes the exception, nearly universal in the Southern\r\nand Western States, that this anti-trust legislation shall not apply\r\nto agricultural products, live stock in the hands of the producer, nor\r\nto the services of laborers or artisans who are formed into societies\r\nor trades-unions--an exception which, of course, makes it\r\nclass legislation, and has caused the whole law to be declared\r\nunconstitutional, so far as I know, by the highest court of every\r\nState where it has been drawn in question, and under the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment also by the Supreme Court of the United States; and in this\r\nspirit President Taft has just acted in preventing a joint resolution\r\nof Congress appropriating money to prosecute trusts from exempting\r\nlabor unions. The Kansas statute is substantially like the Michigan,\r\nbut more vague in wording (Kansas, 1889, 257). It denounces\r\narrangements, contracts, agreements, etc., which (also) _tend_ to\r\nadvance, reduce, or control the price or the cost to the producer or\r\nconsumer of any productions or articles, or the rate of insurance or\r\ninterest on money or any other service. The Maine law (Maine, 1889,\r\n266, 1) is aimed only against the old-fashioned trust; that is to say,\r\nthe entering of firms or incorporated companies into an agreement or\r\ncombination, or the assignment of powers or stock to a central board,\r\nand such trust certificates or other evidences of interest are\r\ndeclared void. The Alabama statute of 1891 is to similar effect.\r\n\r\nThe Tennessee statute of 1891 is about the same as the Kansas statute\r\nof 1889, above referred to, except that it adds the words \"which tend\r\nin any way to create a monopoly,\" and the Kansas statute makes trust\r\ncertificates unlawful, that being still the usual way of organizing a\r\ntrust at that time. The Nebraska law (Nebraska, 1889, 69) is much the\r\nsame, except that it also denounces combinations, etc., whereby\r\na common price shall be fixed and whereby any one or more of the\r\ncombining parties shall cease the sale or manufacture of such\r\nproducts, or where the products or profits of such manufacture or\r\nsale shall be made a common fund to be divided among parties to\r\nthe combination, and goes on to add that \"pooling between persons,\r\npartnerships, corporations ... engaged in the same or like business\r\nfor any purpose whatever, and the formation of combinations or common\r\nunderstanding\" between them is declared unlawful, and the persons are\r\nmade liable for the full damage suffered by persons injured thereby,\r\nand each day of the continuance of any such pool or trust shall\r\nconstitute a separate offence; this, the doctrine of a continuing\r\nconspiracy, being for the first time before the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States at the time of writing. North Carolina the same year\r\n(N.C., 1889, 374) defines a trust to be an arrangement, understanding,\r\netc. for the purpose of increasing or reducing the price beyond\r\nwhat would be fixed by natural demand, and makes it a felony with\r\npunishment up to ten years' imprisonment. Here for the first time\r\nappears a statute against unfair competition. \"Any merchant,\r\nmanufacturer ... who shall sell any ... goods ... for less than actual\r\ncost for the purpose of breaking down competitors shall be guilty of\r\na misdemeanor.\" Tennessee the same year (Tennessee, 1899, 250) in its\r\nelaborate statute, which is a fairly good definition of the law, also\r\ndenounces throwing goods on the market for the purpose of creating\r\nan undue depression, whatever that may mean. In the next year, 1890,\r\nthere were many more State statutes, but we should first notice a\r\nsimple law of New York forbidding any stock corporation from combining\r\nwith any other corporation for the prevention of competition (N.Y.,\r\n1890, 564, 7). The usual statute in other States of that year is\r\naddressed against combinations to regulate or fix prices or limit\r\nthe output, but Texas (4847a, 1) and Mississippi (1890, 36, 1) have\r\nelaborate laws, which, however, add hardly any new principles to the\r\ncommon law. They define a trust to be a combination of capital, skill,\r\nor acts, by two or more persons or corporations, (1) to create or\r\ncarry out restrictions in trade; (2) to limit or reduce the output, or\r\nincrease or reduce the price; (3) to prevent competition; (4) to fix\r\nat any standard or figure whereby its price to the public shall be in\r\nany manner controlled, any article intended for sale, etc.; (5) to\r\nmake or carry out any contract or agreement by which they are bound\r\nnot to sell or trade, etc., below a common standard figure, or to\r\nkeep the price at a fixed or graduated figure, or to preclude free or\r\nunrestricted competition among themselves or others, or to pool or\r\nunite any interest. To much the same effect is the statute of South\r\nDakota (1890, 154, 1), but it also denounces any combination which\r\ntends to advance the price to the consumer of any article beyond the\r\nreasonable cost of production or manufacture. The Louisiana (1890, 36)\r\nand New Mexico laws (1891, 10) are aimed particularly at attempts\r\nto monopolize, while the Oklahoma statute (6620) was aimed only at\r\ncorporations, and the broad wording of the Federal act passed this\r\nyear should be noted: \"Every contract, combination, in the form of\r\ntrust or otherwise, or conspiracy in restraint of trade or commerce\r\namong the several States or with foreign nations, is hereby declared\r\nto be illegal\" (U.S., 1890, 647, 1); and in the second section: \"Every\r\nperson who shall monopolize, or attempt to monopolize, or combine or\r\nconspire with any other person or persons to monopolize, any part\r\nof the trade or commerce among the several States, or with foreign\r\nnations, shall be deemed guilty under this act.\" And in the third\r\nsection: \"Every person who shall make any such contract, or engage\r\nin any such combination or conspiracy, shall be deemed guilty of a\r\nmisdemeanor.\" The rest of the legislation provides penalties, manner,\r\nand machinery for the enforcement of these laws by prosecuting\r\nattorneys, etc., with a usual allowance to informants; and it may be\r\nhere noted that one great trouble has resulted from this machinery,\r\nfor it provided injunction remedies and dissolution, which may well\r\nbe too severe a penalty, and, furthermore, dispenses with a jury and\r\nthrows unnecessarily upon the court--even now, as in the Standard Oil\r\ncase, a distant high court of appeal--the burden of determining a\r\ncomplicated and voluminous mass of fact. Our ancestors never would\r\nhave suffered such matters to be adjudged by the Chancellor!\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota has an extraordinary statute making the agents for\r\nagricultural implements, etc., guilty of a criminal offence when their\r\nprincipals refuse to sell at wholesale prices to dealers in the State\r\n(S.D., 1890, 154, 2). But beside these remedies, there is a frequent\r\nstatute dating from the earliest Kansas act of 1889, that debts for\r\ngoods sold by a so-called trust, contracts made in violation of\r\nthe law, will not be enforced in favor of the offending person or\r\ncorporation. That is to say, the person buying the goods of a trust\r\nmay simply refuse to pay for them; and the constitutionality of this\r\nlegislation has recently been sustained by a divided opinion in the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States.[1] The possession or ownership\r\nof trust certificates is in some States made criminal. Corporations\r\noffending against the statute are to have their charters taken away,\r\nor, if chartered in other States, to be expelled from the State. All\r\ncontracts or agreements in violation of any of these statutes are, of\r\ncourse, made void.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Continental Wall Paper Co. _v_. Voight, 212 U.S. 227.]\r\n\r\nThere are special statutes in Kansas, Nebraska, and North Dakota\r\nagainst trusts in certain lines of business, as, for instance, the\r\nbuying or selling of live-stock or grain of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn the twenty years that have elapsed since this early legislation\r\nthere has been considerable clarifying in the legislative mind; modern\r\nstatutes, and especially constitutional provisions, stating the\r\noffence much more concisely, with a simple reliance upon the common\r\nlaw, leaving it, in other words, for the courts to define. The\r\nSouthern State constitutions generally enact that the legislatures\r\nshall enact laws to prevent trusts. New Hampshire says: \"Full and fair\r\ncompetition in the trades and industries is an inherent and essential\r\nright of the people, and should be protected against all monopolies\r\nand conspiracies which tend to hinder or destroy.\" Oklahoma provides\r\nthat \"the legislature shall define what is an unlawful combination,\r\nmonopoly, trust, act, or agreement, in restraint of trade, and enact\r\nlaws to punish persons engaged in any unlawful combination, monopoly,\r\ntrust, act, or agreement, in restraint of trade, or composing any\r\nsuch monopoly, trust, or combination.\" In Wyoming, monopolies and\r\nperpetuities, in South Dakota and Washington, monopolies and trusts,\r\nare \"contrary to the genius of a free State and should not be\r\nallowed.\" The constitutional provisions of North Dakota, Minnesota,\r\nand Utah are again a mere repetition of the common law. The New\r\nHampshire statute grants \"all just power ... to the general court to\r\nenact laws to prevent operations within the State of ... trusts ...,\"\r\nor the operations of persons and corporations who \"endeavor to raise\r\nthe price of any article of commerce or to destroy free and fair\r\ncompetition ... through conspiracy, monopoly or any other unfair means\r\nto control and regulate the acts of all such persons.\" This last\r\nclause, though a clear statement of the common law, would, of course,\r\nrender hopeless Mr. Gompers's crusade in favor of the boycott, the\r\nobject of a boycott invariably being to control the acts of somebody\r\nelse. Alabama directs the legislature to provide for the prohibition\r\nof trusts, etc., so as to prevent them from making scarce articles\r\nof necessity, trade, or commerce, increasing unreasonably the cost\r\nthereof, or preventing reasonable competition; and to much the same\r\neffect in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nWe may well close this brief survey by a study of the volume of such\r\nlegislation. We have, for instance, in 1890, seven anti-trust laws;\r\nin 1891, six; in 1892, one; in 1893, eight. In 1894, doubtless as a\r\nconsequence of the panic, anti-trust legislation absolutely ceased,\r\nand in 1895 there is only one law, passed by the State of Texas, its\r\nold law having been declared unconstitutional. In 1896, under the\r\ninfluence of President Cleveland's administration, we find four such\r\nstatutes, and in 1897, with reviving prosperity, thirteen. Still,\r\nwe find no new principle, except, indeed, the somewhat startling\r\nstatement in Kansas that it is unlawful to handle goods made or\r\ncontrolled by monopolies. The Illinois statute of that year permitted\r\ncombinations as to articles whose chief cost is wages when the object\r\nor effect is to maintain or increase wages, a qualification which led\r\nto the whole law's being declared unconstitutional. In Tennessee there\r\nis a special statute penalizing combinations to raise the price of\r\ncoal, a statute with good old precedents in early English legislation.\r\nBy this time most of the States had adopted anti-trust statutes. In\r\n1898 we find only one law, that of Ohio, giving the same five-fold\r\ndefinition of the trust that we found above in Alabama, but it\r\nadds the somewhat startling statement that \"the character of the\r\ncombination may be established by proof of its general reputation as\r\nsuch,\" and again it is made criminal to own trust certificates, with\r\ndouble damages in all cases to persons injured. A constitutional\r\nlawyer might well doubt whether a conviction under the last half of\r\nthis statute would be sustained. In 1899 eleven of the remaining\r\nStates adopted anti-trust laws. In 1900 there is a new statute in\r\nMississippi prohibiting, among other things, the pooling of bids for\r\npublic work, this again being a mere statement of the common law,\r\nalthough a law which has possibly grown uncommon by being generally\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 there are four statutes, that of Minnesota also including a\r\nprohibition of boycotts, and the first piece of legislation upon the\r\nsubject in the old Commonwealth of Massachusetts--an ordinary statute\r\nagainst exclusive dealing; that is to say, the making it a condition\r\nof the sale of goods that the purchaser shall not sell or deal in the\r\ngoods of any other person. In 1902 both the Georgia and Texas laws\r\nwere declared unconstitutional because they exempted agricultural\r\npursuits. South Carolina has a statute actually prohibiting any sale\r\nat less than the cost of manufacture, doubtless also unconstitutional.\r\nIn Ohio corporations are forbidden to own stock in competing\r\ncompanies. The Illinois anti-trust act was declared unconstitutional\r\nin 1903, while Texas amended its statute to meet the constitutional\r\nobjection, and followed South Carolina in prohibiting the sale of\r\ngoods at less than cost.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 there is no anti-trust legislation. In 1905 the South Carolina\r\nlaw is held unconstitutional, and in 1906, that of Montana. In 1907,\r\nhowever, under the Roosevelt administration, there was a decided\r\nrevival of interest, seventeen States adopting new statutes or\r\namendments, but still I can find no new principles. Kansas copies the\r\nMassachusetts statute, and Massachusetts extends it to the sale\r\nor lease of machinery or tools. Minnesota and North Carolina have\r\ninteresting statutes prohibiting discrimination between localities\r\nin the sale of any commodity. Most of the States by this time have\r\nstatutes compelling persons to give testimony in litigation about\r\ntrusts and exempting them from prosecution therefor. North Dakota has\r\nalso a statute prohibiting unfair competition and discrimination as\r\nagainst localities, while Tennessee makes it a misdemeanor to sell any\r\narticle below cost or to give it away for the purpose of destroying\r\ncompetition. In 1908 Louisiana and Mississippi adopted the principle\r\nforbidding discrimination against localities, and the new State of\r\nOklahoma comes into line with the usual drastic anti-trust statute,\r\nand we may, perhaps, conclude this review of a somewhat unintelligent\r\nlegislative history by perhaps the most amusing example of all.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Massachusetts, which had so far refrained from\r\nunnecessary legislation on this great question, thought it necessary\r\nto adopt a statute making void contracts to create monopolies in\r\nrestraint of trade, which well shows the necessity of a legislative\r\nreference bureau or professional draftsman, as discussed in a later\r\nchapter. That is to say, it says literally: \"Every contract, etc.,\r\nin violation of the common law ... is hereby declared to be against\r\npublic policy, illegal, and void.\" As the law of Massachusetts is the\r\ncommon law, and always has been the common law, this amounts to saying\r\nthat a contract which has always been void in Massachusetts is now\r\ndeclared to be void. But, moreover, on a familiar principle of\r\nhermeneutics, it might be argued to repeal the whole _criminal_ common\r\nlaw of restraint of trade--doubtless the last thing they intended to\r\ndo!\r\n\r\nAs this is a book upon actual legislation, it would be out of place\r\nto attempt a serious discussion of the problem that lies before us.\r\nSuffice it to say that there are three possible methods of approaching\r\nthe question, as it is complicated with the interstate commerce power\r\nof the Federal government. That is to say, either to surrender this\r\npower to the States, at least so far as it may be necessary to enable\r\nthem to regulate or prohibit the actions of combinations in the\r\nStates, even when engaged In interstate commerce; or, second,\r\nby perfecting the present dual system and establishing Federal\r\nsupervision over State corporations engaged in interstate commerce by\r\nway of license and control; or, third, the most radical remedy of all,\r\napparently adopted by the present administration, of surrendering\r\nentirely the State power over corporations to the Federal government,\r\nat least as to such corporations as might choose to take advantage of\r\nsuch legislation. This would result in a centralization of nearly all\r\nbusiness under the control of the Federal government, as well as the\r\nremoval of the great bulk of litigation from State to Federal courts.\r\nIf not carefully guarded it would deprive the States not only of their\r\npower to tax corporations, but of their ordinary police powers over\r\ntheir administration. Such a radical step was unanimously opposed by\r\nthe United States Industrial Commission in 1900, and by nearly all\r\ntheir expert witnesses, and was then, at least, only favored by the\r\nheads of the great trusts, Mr. Archbold, Mr. Rockefeller, and Mr.\r\nHavemeyer.[1] But whichever way we look at it, there is no question\r\nthat the problem of the modern trust is that of the corporation, both\r\nas to what laws shall regulate such a corporation, and whether they\r\nshall be acts of Congress, or State statutes, or both.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the full arguments on this most important question,\r\nthe reader may be referred to the article by Horace L. Wilgus in the\r\n_Michigan Law Review_, February and April, 1904, and to the writer's\r\ndebate with Judge Grosscup, printed in the _Inter-Nation Magazine_ for\r\nMarch, 1907.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nCORPORATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest trading or business corporation in the modern sense now\r\nextant seems to have been chartered in England about the year 1600,\r\nthough Holt in the monopoly case dates the Muscovy Company from 1401,\r\nand, despite the Roman civic corporations, has really no actual\r\nprecedent in economic history; that is to say, as a phenomenon under\r\nwhich the greater part of business affairs was in fact conducted.\r\nWhether derived historically from the guild or the monastic\r\ncorporation of the Middle Ages is a question merely of academic\r\nimportance, for the business corporation rapidly became a very\r\ndifferent thing from either; and, indeed, its most important\r\ncharacteristic, that of relieving the members of responsibility for\r\nthe debts of the corporation, is an invention of very modern times\r\nindeed, the first statute of that sort having been invented in the\r\nState of Connecticut, enacted in May, 1818. These early English\r\ncorporations, such as the Turkey Company, the Fellowship of Merchant\r\nAdventurers, chartered in 1643, or the Hudson Bay Company, usually\r\ngave a monopoly of trade with the respective countries indicated, such\r\nmonopolies in foreign countries not being considered obnoxious.[1] The\r\nwording of such early charters follows substantially the language of\r\na town or guild charter, and was doubtless suggested by them.\r\nUnfortunately, it has never been the custom to print corporation\r\ncharters in the Statutes of the Realm, and it is practically\r\nimpossible to get a sight of the original documents if, indeed, in\r\nmany cases, they now exist. So far as I have been able to study them,\r\nthey always give the right to transfer shares freely, with the other\r\ngreat right, perpetual succession; but no notion appears, for at least\r\ntwo centuries, that the shareholders are relieved from any of the\r\nlegal obligations of the corporation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The charter of the East India Company was attacked on\r\nthis ground and successfully defended by Holt on the ground that the\r\ncommon law did not mind monopolies in trade with heathens!]\r\n\r\nIn order to understand this whole problem it is necessary to bear\r\nin mind certain cardinal principles of our constitutional law. All\r\ncorporations, with the exception of national banks, two or three\r\nrailroad companies, and the Panama Canal, have been and are creatures\r\nof the State, not, as yet, of the Federal government, which can only\r\ncreate them for purposes specifically delegated to it and not merely\r\nfor private profit. The power to create corporations is essential to\r\nsovereignty, and the sovereign may decline to recognize all but its\r\nown corporations. Under the doctrine of comity, such corporations can\r\nact in any other State with all the powers given them in the State\r\nwhere they are created, except only they be expressly limited by a\r\nstatute of such other State. They may, however, be entirely excluded;\r\nonly not to the destruction of property rights once acquired. On the\r\nother hand, corporations conducting interstate commerce may not be\r\nexcluded or such business interfered with by State legislation.\r\n\r\nThe writer was for four years counsel to the Industrial Commission at\r\nWashington and one of the commissioners appointed to draw the present\r\nbusiness corporation law of Massachusetts. In both such capacities he\r\nhad the advantage of hearing the expert opinions of many witnesses.\r\nThere were two, and only two, broad theories of legislation about\r\nprivate business corporations: One view, the older view, that they\r\nshould be carefully limited and regulated by the State at every point,\r\nand that their solvency, or at least the intrinsic value of their\r\ncapital stock, should, as far as possible, be guaranteed by\r\nlegislation, to the public as well as to their creditors and\r\nstockholders; and that for any fraud, or even defect of organization,\r\nthe stockholders, or at least the directors, should be liable. On the\r\nother hand, the modern view, that it was no business of the public to\r\nprotect investors, or even creditors, and that the corporations should\r\nbe given as free a hand as possible, with no limitation as to their\r\nsize, the nature of business they are to transact, or the payment\r\nin of their capital stock. This is the corporation problem. The\r\nState-and-Federal problem may be called that other difficulty which\r\narises from the clashing jurisdictions of the States among themselves\r\nand with the Federal government, their laws and their courts, as to\r\nthe corporations now created, particularly railroads and corporations\r\n\"engaged in interstate commerce\" which may include all the \"trusts,\"\r\nif the mere fact that they do business in many States makes them so.\r\n\r\nSuppose you had a world where one man in every ten was gifted with\r\nimmortality and with the right not to be answerable for anything that\r\nhe did. You can easily see that the structure of society, at least\r\nas to property, labor, and business affairs, would be very decidedly\r\naltered. Yet this is what really happened with the invention of the\r\nmodern corporation; only we have got completely used to it. It would\r\nbe possible to have got on without any business corporations at all.\r\nStriking as this may seem at first thought, one must remember that the\r\nworld got on very well without corporations for thousands of years,\r\nand that it was by a mere historical accident and a modern invention\r\nthat the two great attributes of the corporation, immortality and\r\npersonal irresponsibility, were brought about. All business might\r\nstill be conducted, as it was in the Middle Ages, by individual men\r\nor by partnerships, and still we should have had very great single\r\nfortunes like that of Jacques Coeur in France, an early prototype of\r\nMr. J. Pierpont Morgan, or even vast hereditary fortunes kept in\r\none family, like the Fuggers of Augsburg, and based on a natural\r\nmonopoly--mineral salt--as is Mr. Rockefeller's upon mineral oil. Yet\r\nas lives are short and abilities not usually hereditary, the great\r\ncorporation question of to-day would hardly have arisen. Nevertheless,\r\nit is presumed that no one, not even the greatest radical, would now\r\npropose to dispense with the invention of the business corporation\r\nwith limited liability.\r\n\r\nA careful discussion of the two theories above referred to will be\r\nfound in pages 1 to 28 of the report of the Committee on Corporation\r\nLaws to the legislature of Massachusetts, of January, 1903. The bill\r\nfor a business corporation law recommended by this committee was\r\nenacted into law without substantial change, and has apparently been\r\nsatisfactory in the six years it has been in force, as the amendments\r\nto it, except only as to the system of taxation of corporations, have\r\nbeen few and trifling. I venture to quote from the report referred to\r\na few of the remarks of the commissioners upon the general question,\r\nas it is now out of print:\r\n\r\n    The investigations of the committee, the results of which have\r\n    been briefly summarized, have led to the following conclusions:\r\n\r\n    _First_.--That the more important provisions of the present law\r\n    regulating the organization and conduct of business corporations\r\n    and the liability of its stockholders and officers are unsuited to\r\n    modern business conditions.\r\n\r\n    _Second_.--That the restrictions governing capitalization and the\r\n    payment of stock as shown in the piecemeal legislation enlarging\r\n    the classes of corporations which may organize under general laws\r\n    are arbitrary or impossible of execution.\r\n\r\n    _Third_.--That it is a general practice to organize under the laws\r\n    of other States corporations to carry on enterprises which are\r\n    owned and managed by citizens of Massachusetts, particularly where\r\n    a part or all the property is situated outside the State.\r\n\r\nTHEORY OF LEGISLATION RECOMMENDED\r\n\r\nThe history of corporations, as well as the logic of the case, shows\r\nthat there are possible two general theories as to the State's duty in\r\ncreating corporations: first, the old theory that, being creatures\r\nof the State, they should be guaranteed by it to the public in all\r\nparticulars of responsibility and management; and the modern quite\r\nopposite theory that, in the absence of fraud in its organization or\r\ngovernment, an ordinary business corporation should be allowed to do\r\nanything that an individual may do. Under the old theory the capital\r\nstock of a corporation was, in the law, considered to be a guarantee\r\nfund for the payment of creditors, as well as affording a method of\r\nconveniently measuring the interests of the individual owners of a\r\ncorporate enterprise. There resulted from this principle not only the\r\nfundamental proposition that the capital stock, being in the nature of\r\na guarantee fund, should be paid up at its full par in actual cash,\r\nbut all the other provisions to protect creditors or other persons\r\nhaving dealings with the corporation; such as, that the debts of a\r\ncorporation should not exceed its capital stock--designed primarily in\r\nthe interest of creditors and secondarily in that of the stockholders,\r\nwho were looked after as carefully as if they were the wards of the\r\nState when dealing in corporation matters. Under the modern theory,\r\nthe State owes no duty, to persons who may choose to deal with\r\ncorporations, to look after the solvency of such artificial bodies;\r\nnor to stockholders, to protect them from the consequences of going\r\ninto such concerns, the idea being that, in the case of ordinary\r\nbusiness corporations, the State's duty ends in providing clearly that\r\ncreditors and stockholders shall at all times be precisely informed of\r\nall the facts attending both the organization and the management\r\nof such corporations, and particularly that there should be full\r\npublicity given to all details of the original organization thereof.\r\n\r\nThe committee has had little hesitation in determining which of these\r\ntheories it should adopt. The limit of capitalization both in amount\r\nand in valuation to the net tangible assets of the corporation has\r\nunquestionably had much to do with the arrest of corporate growth in\r\nthis commonwealth. Good-will, trade-marks, patents may unquestionably\r\nbe valuable assets, which, under our present method, may not be\r\ncapitalized. Admirable as this theory may have been, of payment of\r\ncapital stock in full in cash, the condition is so easily avoided\r\nin practice that the result is that our existing law promises a\r\nprotection which, in reality, it does not afford, and is merely an\r\nembarrassment to those who feel obliged to comply not only with the\r\nletter but with the spirit of the law. It is no longer true that\r\npersons dealing with corporations rely upon the State laws to\r\nguarantee their solvency or their proper management. The attempts of\r\nthe commonwealth to do so by laws still remaining on its statute books\r\nresult, as we apprehend, only in a false sense of security; and we\r\nbelieve that the act proposed, while giving up the attempt to do the\r\nimpossible thing, will really, by its greater attention to the details\r\nof organization required to be made public by all corporations, result\r\nin an advantage to stockholders and creditors more substantial than\r\nthe present partial attempt to enforce a principle impossible of\r\ncomplete realization and which is, under existing laws, easily evaded.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to reconcile or combine the two systems. Either the\r\nold theory must be maintained, under which the State attempts though\r\nvainly to guarantee both to stockholders and creditors that there is\r\none hundred dollars of actual value behind each one hundred dollars\r\nof par value of capital stock, or some other system must be adopted\r\nwhich, while not being chargeable with the vagueness and laxity of\r\nthe newer legislation of other States, will permit a share of capital\r\nstock, although nominally one hundred dollars in value, to represent,\r\nas the word implies, only a certain share or proportion, which may\r\nbe more or less than par, of whatever net assets the corporation may\r\nprove to have. Under a system of this sort the State machinery will\r\nonly provide that the stockholders and, perhaps, the creditors, may at\r\nall times have access to the corporation records or returns in such\r\nmanner as clearly to show, both at organization and thereafter, all of\r\nthe property or assets of which such share of capital stock actually\r\nrepresents its proportion of ownership.\r\n\r\nThe question of monopoly the committee does not conceive to have\r\nbeen left to its consideration. The limitations now existing on the\r\ncapitalization of business corporations are, no doubt, attributable\r\nto the sentiment which has always existed against monopoly, but it\r\nis clearly the policy of the commonwealth, as shown in its\r\nrecent legislation, to do away with the attempt to prevent large\r\ncorporations, simply because they are large. Moreover, it is\r\napprehended that the question of monopoly, or rather of the abuse of\r\nthe power of large corporations, does not result necessarily from the\r\nsize of corporations engaged in business throughout the United States.\r\nIn the opinion of the committee, some confusion has been created,\r\nin the discussion of the form of so-called trust legislation, by a\r\nfailure to appreciate that its real object is not to protect the\r\ninvestor, who can or should learn to take care of himself, or the\r\ncreditor who has already learned to do so. The real purpose of such\r\nlegislation is the protection of the consumer. In other words, there\r\nis no reason for an arbitrary limitation of capitalization unless it\r\ncan be used as a means of creating a monopoly which will influence the\r\nprice of commodities. In the opinion of the committee, the question\r\nof capitalization is not a contributing factor in the fight for a\r\nmonopoly. The United States Steel Company would have no greater and\r\nno less a monopoly of the steel business if it were organized with\r\none-half of its present capitalization. The Standard Oil Company has\r\na very conservative capitalization, and yet it is the most complete\r\nmonopoly of any industrial corporation in this country.\r\n\r\nIt has not been the intention of the committee to draft a law which\r\nwill be favorable to the organization of large corporations popularly\r\nknown as \"trusts.\" Inasmuch as the recommended law requires taxes to\r\nbe paid upon the full value of the corporate franchise, which is, at\r\nleast to some extent, measured by the amount of capitalization, there\r\nwill always be this very potent reason for keeping capitalization\r\nat the lowest possible point. Indeed, it is apprehended that the\r\norganization of a corporation large enough to control a monopoly of\r\nany staple article is practically prohibited by the provisions of the\r\nrecommended law as to taxation, which will be referred to in greater\r\ndetail in part II of this report. At all events, it is no better for\r\nthe State to leave its citizens at the mercy of the large corporations\r\ncreated by other less careful sovereignties, than to permit the\r\norganization of corporations adequate to the demands of modern\r\nbusiness under its own laws, subject to its own more careful\r\nregulation and control. Under our State and Federal system it is\r\npractically impossible for any one State, by its own laws, to control\r\nforeign corporations, but so far as possible at present the committee\r\nhas sought to subject them to the same safeguards of reasonable\r\npublicity and accurate returns, both as to organization and annual\r\ncondition, as the State requires of its own corporations. The simple\r\nrequirement of an annual excise tax, based on the capitalization of\r\nsuch foreign corporations, will serve to bring them under the control\r\nof this State and the way will be open for their further regulation if\r\ndesirable. This annual tax has been levied upon the same principle\r\nas the corresponding tax paid by home corporations. The State should\r\nimpose no greater burden on foreign corporations than on its own, but\r\nshould, so far as possible, subject them to its own laws.\r\n\r\nThe recommendations of the committee have, therefore, been controlled\r\nby three principles, which may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n_First_.--The relation of the State to the corporation.\r\n\r\nThe committee would repeat its opinion that, so far as purely business\r\ncorporations are concerned, and excluding insurance, financial and\r\npublic service corporations, the State cannot assume to act, directly\r\nor indirectly, as guarantor or sponsor for any organization under\r\ncorporate form. It can and should require for itself and for the use\r\nof all persons interested in the corporation, the fullest and most\r\ndetailed information, consistent with practical business methods,\r\nas to the details of its organization, the powers and restrictions\r\nimposed upon its stockholders and as to the property against which\r\nstock is to be or has been issued. Provision is, therefore, made\r\nin the law drafted by the committee for the organization of such\r\ncorporations for any lawful purpose other than for such purposes as\r\nthe manufacture and distilling of intoxicating liquors or the buying\r\nand selling of real estate which it has been the consistent policy of\r\nthe commonwealth to except from incorporation under the general law.\r\nAny desired capitalization above a minimum of one thousand dollars may\r\nbe fixed. Capital stock may be paid for in cash or by property. If it\r\nis paid for in cash, it may be paid for in full or by instalments, and\r\na machinery has been created for protecting the corporation against\r\nthe failure of the subscribers to stock to pay the balance of their\r\nsubscriptions. If stock is paid for by property, the incorporators and\r\nnot the State are to pass upon its value. Before any stock, however,\r\ncan be issued for property, a description of the property sufficient\r\nfor purposes of identification, to the satisfaction of the\r\nCommissioner of Corporations, must be filed in the office of the\r\nSecretary of the Commonwealth. This document becomes a public record\r\nand may be consulted by any one interested in the corporation. If the\r\nofficers of a corporation make a return which is false and which is\r\nknown to be false, they are liable to any one injured for actual\r\ndamages. If a full and honest description is made of property against\r\nwhich stock is issued, a stockholder cannot complain because of his\r\nfailure to inform himself by personal examination or investigation of\r\nthe value of the property in which he is, or contemplates becoming, an\r\ninvestor.\r\n\r\n_Second_.--Duties of the State in regulating the relations between the\r\ncorporation and its officers and stockholders.\r\n\r\nThe second principle upon which the committee has acted in its\r\nspecific recommendations is this: that the State should permit the\r\nutmost freedom of self-regulation if it provides quick and effective\r\nmachinery for the punishment of fraud, and gives to each stockholder\r\nthe right to obtain the fullest information in regard to his own\r\nrights and privileges before and after he becomes the owner of stock.\r\n\r\nUpon this theory the committee has recommended a law which permits the\r\ncorporation to determine the classes of its stock and the rights and\r\nliabilities of its stockholders. The recommended law provides for\r\nincreasing or decreasing the amount of capital stock upon the\r\naffirmative vote of a majority of its stockholders. For the protection\r\nof a minority interest of stockholders it requires a two-thirds vote\r\nto change the classes of capital stock or their voting power, to\r\nchange the corporate name or the nature of the business of the\r\ncorporation, or to authorize a sale, lease, or exchange of its\r\nproperty or assets.\r\n\r\nDirectors are made liable, jointly and severally, for actual damages\r\ncaused by their fraudulent acts, but no director is made so liable\r\nunless he concurs in the act and has knowledge of the fraud. The\r\nliability of stockholders is limited to the payment of stock for\r\nwhich they have subscribed, to debts to employees, and in cases of\r\na reduction of capital when they concur in the vote authorizing\r\na distribution of assets which results in the insolvency of the\r\ncorporation. An attempt has been made to give to the stockholder an\r\nopportunity of securing for himself the fullest information on all\r\npoints touching his interest.\r\n\r\n_Third_.--The relation of the State to foreign corporations.\r\n\r\nThe committee has been guided upon this subject by the theory that the\r\ntreatment of foreign corporations by the Commonwealth should, so far\r\nas practicable, be the same as of its own, particularly so far as\r\nconcerns the liabilities of officers and stockholders, the statements\r\nfiled with the State authorities for the information of stockholders\r\nor others as to their capitalization and the methods adopted of paying\r\nin their stock, and the annual reports of condition required for\r\ntaxation purposes or otherwise. On the same principle a nominal\r\nfranchise tax is annually imposed corresponding to the tax imposed by\r\nthe State on its own corporations and made approximately proportional\r\nin amount.\r\n\r\nA few broad general principles are almost universal in American\r\nlegislation on the subject. Ordinary business corporations are now\r\nalmost universally created under general law, and indeed by the\r\nconstitutions of many States are forbidden to be created by special\r\ncharter.[1] There is generally, however, no limitation by constitution\r\non the size or capitalization, though the duration of corporations is\r\nfrequently limited to twenty, thirty, or fifty years; and there is\r\ngenerally no limitation on the nature of the business that may be\r\ndone, except, in a large number of States, banking and insurance, and\r\nexcept that there is in many States, as, notably, Massachusetts, a\r\nprejudice against land companies, so that they may not be created\r\nwithout a special charter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Stimson's \"Federal and State Constitutions,\" pp. 295,\r\n315, 316.]\r\n\r\nThe liability of stockholders is commonly limited to the shares of\r\nstock actually held or such portion of them as may not have been paid\r\nup by the stockholder in cash or property value. Massachusetts and the\r\nmore conservative States attempt to provide that the stock shall be\r\nactually paid up in money or in property of the real value of money,\r\nat par. New Jersey, New York, Maine, West Virginia, and the laxer\r\nStates, practically allow their directors to issue stock for anything\r\nthey choose--labor, contracts, property, or a patent right--and their\r\njudgment on the value of such property is held to be final in the\r\nabsence of fraud. Corporations are usually taxed, like individuals,\r\non their tangible, visible property, real and personal, and in many\r\nStates there is also a franchise tax on their shares.[1] There is a\r\nfrequent limitation that the corporate indebtedness shall not exceed\r\nthe amount of the capital stock.[2] No States, except Vermont and\r\nNew Hampshire, seem now to have any limitation on the amount of the\r\ncapital stock, or if there be a limitation, as of one million dollars\r\nat the time of formation, the corporation may subsequently increase\r\nits stock to any amount.[3] Michigan, however, had a limitation of\r\nfive million dollars as to manufacturing or mercantile corporations,\r\nand two million five hundred thousand dollars as to mines; while\r\nAlabama and Missouri had a general limit of ten million dollars. The\r\ngeneral tendency is clearly to have no limitation whatever. Commonly\r\nonly a nominal proportion of the capital stock is to be paid in before\r\nthe company begins business, but the stockholders are always liable\r\nto creditors for the amount unpaid. As already remarked, stock may\r\nusually be paid up in property, labor, or services, or, indeed,\r\nany legal consideration; and though most States provide that such\r\nproperty, etc., shall be taken at its actual cash value, such laws,\r\nexcept in Massachusetts, are not believed to be effectual.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A valuable report on this subject, brought down to 1903,\r\nprepared by F.J. MacLeod, of Massachusetts, will be found in the\r\n\"Report of the Committee on Corporation Laws,\" above referred to, at\r\npp. 207-295.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MacLeod, pp. 165-166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: MacLeod, p. 169.]\r\n\r\nThat stockholders are individually liable to the extent of the unpaid\r\nbalance on their stock is merely a statutory statement of the ordinary\r\nrule in equity. It is, therefore, law without statute. Apparently only\r\nIndiana and Kansas now impose a double liability, the law in Ohio\r\nhaving been recently altered by constitutional amendment. In several\r\nStates, however, they are liable for debts due for labor; in\r\nCalifornia they are absolutely liable for such proportion of all\r\nliabilities of the corporation as their stock bears to the total\r\ncapital stock, while in Nevada they are expressly exempted from any\r\nliability whatever.\r\n\r\nWe can trace two other decided tendencies in recent legislation about\r\ncorporations. First, the increasing effort to bring about publicity of\r\nall such matters as well as of the annual books and accounts, well\r\nexemplified in the Massachusetts statute; second, the usual strong\r\nprohibitions against consolidations to permit trusts or contracts to\r\nfurther monopoly. There has also been a still more recent line of\r\nlegislation to prevent corporations from holding stock in other\r\ncorporations, or, at least, in competing companies; and to prevent alien\r\ncorporations from holding land.[1] Under the strict common law no\r\ncorporation could own or hold stock in another corporation or in itself.\r\nThis has been completely departed from in practice in this country, and\r\nthough not affirmatively recognized in most statutes--the Massachusetts\r\nstatute, for instance, carefully avoids providing that the corporation\r\nmay own stock in other companies--yet the practice has been universally\r\nratified by the courts, if not by the implications of legislation. This\r\nnew tendency to forbid it therefore is merely a return to common-law\r\ndoctrine. Thus,[2] in 1903 only five States--Connecticut, Delaware,\r\nMaine, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania--provided generally that a\r\ncorporation might own stock in another corporation; two States--Indiana\r\nand Minnesota--so provided as to manufacturing or mining companies. In\r\nNew York, Ohio, and other States, a corporation could only own stock in\r\nanother corporation engaged in a similar business, or a business useful\r\nor subsidiary, or in a corporation (New York) with which it was legally\r\nentitled to consolidate; but the tendency of recent legislation is\r\nprecisely opposite on this point, forbidding stockholding by all\r\ncorporations in similar or competing companies, or more specifically\r\nforbidding stockholding in similar or competing companies, as well as\r\nstockholding by railroads in railroad companies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See below, chap. 16.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: MacLeod, p. 203.]\r\n\r\nThe practice of permitting the free holding of stock by corporations,\r\nand especially by holding corporations, has been undoubtedly harmful\r\nto the public, and to the public morals, and has been the main cause\r\nmaking possible the speedy acquisition of immense private fortunes.\r\nThe stockholding trust or the device by which (as in the Rock Island\r\nRailway system) a corporation is created for the purpose of holding\r\nhalf the stock of the real corporation and then possibly a third\r\ncorporation, still to hold half the stock in the second, each of them\r\nparting with the other half, obviously makes possible the control\r\nof immense properties by persons having a comparatively small real\r\ninterest. It is a mere arithmetical proposition, for instance, in the\r\ncase mentioned, that whereas in one corporation it takes one-half of\r\nthe stock to control it, the first holding company will enable it\r\nto be controlled by one-fourth and the second by one-eighth of the\r\noriginal stock. Legislation should properly be much more drastic on\r\nthis point; but indeed our whole corporation legislation seems rather\r\nto have been drawn by able lawyers with a view of protecting the\r\ncorporation or the person who profits by the abuse thereof, than with\r\na real desire to apply intelligent and practicable remedies to the\r\nsituation. Thus, until very recently, if now, there has been no\r\nlegislation along this great line of preventing the holding and\r\ngoverning of corporations by such a system of Chinese boxes; nor has\r\nthere been up to date any legislation whatever along the other great\r\nline of excluding objectionable corporations from doing business in\r\nthe State, which any State has, except as to interstate commerce\r\ncorporations, the unquestioned right to do. This right will, of\r\ncourse, disappear entirely if the recommendation of the present\r\nadministration for a general Federal corporation law be adopted. The\r\ninvention of the corporate share enables a clever few to control the\r\nmany; a small minority to control the vast bulk of the real interest\r\nof all property in the country; the problem has obviously proved too\r\ngreat for popular intelligence, for so far little real legislation in\r\nthe people's interest has been effected. Like most ancient popular\r\nprejudices, however, the blind instinct against corporations, common\r\namong our Populists, has a strong historical basis; it comes directly\r\ndown from the prejudice against Mortmain, the dead hand, and from that\r\nagainst the Roman law; for corporations were unknown to the common\r\nlaw, and legislation against Mortmain dates from Magna Charta\r\nitself.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The legislation against trusts, as it existed up to 1900,\r\nwill be found at the back of vol. II of the \"Reports of the United\r\nStates Industrial Commission.\"]\r\n\r\nIt would perhaps be possible for Congress to pass an act forbidding\r\nany corporation to carry on its business outside of the State where it\r\nis chartered, unless, of course, it got charters from other States;\r\ncertainly the States themselves might do so. This remedy also has\r\nnever been tried, and hardly, in Congress, at least, been suggested.\r\nYet it were a more constitutional and far safer thing to do than\r\nto cut the Gordian knot by a Federal incorporation act, which will\r\nforever securely intrench the trusts against State power. Even if New\r\nJersey or the Island of Guam goes on with its lax corporation laws,\r\npermitting its creatures to do business all over the land without\r\nproper regulation, this power could thus be instantly taken away from\r\nit by such an act of Congress, even if the States themselves remained\r\nunready or unwilling to act. Then no corporation could be \"chartered\r\nin New Jersey to break the laws of Minnesota,\" even if Minnesota\r\npermitted it.\r\n\r\nTrusts started as combinations and ended as corporations. They began\r\nas State corporations, subject both to State and Federal control and\r\nregulation; they may end as Federal corporations subject to no control\r\nexcept by Congress. It is too early yet to predict the result, but\r\none assertion may be hazarded, that just as the original Sherman Act\r\nagainst trusts compelled the formation of trusts, so this proposed\r\nFederal legislation will compel the formation of Federal trusts, by\r\nall but the most local of business corporations.\r\n\r\nAs to public-service corporations, both the legislation and the\r\nprinciple on which it rests are, of course, quite different. There is\r\nno serious difference of opinion that the stock should be paid up in\r\nactual money at par nor that dividends at the expense of the public\r\nshould not be paid on watered stock. More and more the States are\r\nputting this sort of legislation into effect. There is also the\r\ngeneral provision discussed in a former chapter that the rates or\r\ncharges of all such corporations may be regulated by law or ordinance;\r\nand by far the most notable trend of legislation in this particular\r\nhas been that franchises of corporations should be limited in time and\r\nshould be sold at auction to the highest bidder. Thus, by a California\r\nlaw of 1897, all municipal franchises must be sold for not less than\r\nthree per cent. of the gross receipts and after a popular vote or\r\nreferendum on the question. It has been matter of party platform for\r\nsome years that all franchises should thus be submitted to the local\r\nreferendum. That is, all exclusive franchises whereby rights in\r\nthe streets, or other rights of the public, are given away to a\r\ncorporation organized for purposes of gain. In Louisiana, street\r\nrailway franchises may only be granted on petition of a majority of\r\nthe abutters, and must be sold at auction for the highest percentage\r\nof gross receipts, and so substantially in South Carolina. In\r\nWashington, an elaborate statute against discrimination by\r\npublic-service corporations was passed by the initiative; but as the\r\nstatute itself omitted the enacting clause the law has been held to be\r\nof no effect. Lastly, we will note as the most recent tendency, a\r\nmore intelligent limitation by the States themselves of corporations\r\norganized in and by other States, frequently denying to such the right\r\nof eminent domain or, as in Massachusetts, to do business or make\r\ncontracts without making full annual returns and submitting in all\r\nrespects to the State jurisdiction. Under recent decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court, however, this power does not extend to any corporation\r\ndoing an interstate commerce business; and, of course, under the\r\nFederal Incorporation Act, proposed by the present administration, the\r\nStates would be completely deprived of such power, except, possibly,\r\nin so far as Congress may choose to relinquish it to them. How far,\r\nindependent of such permission by Congress, the ordinary police power\r\nwould extend, it will be almost impossible to define.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nLABOR LAWS\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch of the law affecting employers or combinations of capital has\r\nits correlative, or rather equivalent, in combinations of labor; but\r\nleaving the matter of combinations for the next chapter, and reserving\r\nfor this only statutes affecting the individual, we must again insist\r\nupon that great cardinal liberty of labor under the English common\r\nlaw, which already gives it a certain privilege and dispenses it from\r\nthe laws affecting ordinary contracts, that is to say: _the contract\r\nof labor, alone of contracts under the English law, may not be\r\nenforced_. When we say \"enforced\" we of course mean that the laborer\r\nmay not be compelled to carry it out; what, in the law, we call\r\nspecific performance. This is a matter of such essential importance\r\nthat it cannot be too strongly accentuated, as it is surprising how\r\nignorant still the popular mind is upon this subject, how little it\r\nrealizes labor's peculiar advantage in this particular. But it has\r\nalways been true of the English and American law, at least since that\r\nearly labor legislation sketched above in chapter 4 which came to\r\na final end at least as early as Elizabeth, that no man could be\r\ncompelled to work--except, of course, by way of punishment for\r\ncrime--and more than that, he could not even be compelled to work or\r\ncarry out a specific contract of labor to which he had bound himself\r\nby all possible formality. \"Specific performance\" is the peculiar\r\nprocess of a court of chancery, and at this point the resistance of\r\nthe freemen of England we have traced in earlier chapters became\r\nabsolutely effectual; that is to say, the court of chancery was never\r\nallowed to extend its strong arm over the labor contract. Even that\r\nfamous first precedent of \"government by injunction\" discussed by us\r\nabove (page 74) was resisted in early times, the precedent was not\r\nfollowed, it fell into complete desuetude, and it remained for the\r\ncase of Springhead Spinning Company _v_. Riley,[1] decided as late as\r\n1868, to extend the injunction process to the prohibition of a strike.\r\nAnd in more recent labor cases it has been found that the line between\r\nprohibiting a man from leaving his employment, even under peculiar\r\ncircumstances, and ordering him to proceed with his contract\r\nof employment and to carry it out, is extremely fine, if not\r\nindistinguishable.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: L.R. 6 Eq. 551.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For instance, the injunction against the employees of the\r\nSouthern California Railroad requiring defendants to perform all\r\ntheir regular and accustomed duties \"so long as they remain in the\r\nemployment of the company\" (62 Fed. 796), has always been severely\r\ncriticised.]\r\n\r\nNow, the reason of this great principle (peculiar, I think, to\r\nAnglo-Saxon law) lies at its very root. It is the principle of\r\npersonal liberty again. To English notions, and to English courts,\r\nindefinite labor continued for an indefinite time, or applied to an\r\nindefinite number of services, is indistinguishable from slavery; and\r\ncompulsory labor even under a definite labor contract, such as to work\r\nfor a week or a month or a year, or in limited directions, as, for\r\ninstance, to work at making shoes or weaving cloth, when enforced by\r\nthe strong arm of the law, smacked too much of slavery to be tolerable\r\nby our ancestors. Thus it is that, alone of all contracts, if a man\r\nsign an agreement to work for us to-day, he may break it to-morrow and\r\nwill not be compelled to perform it; our only redress is to sue him\r\nfor damages, and this again because we can only act under the common\r\nlaw. Chancery at this point at least is forbidden to take cognizance\r\nof matters affecting personal liberty and labor; and the common law,\r\nas has been said, \"sounds only in damages.\" It is only chancery that\r\ncan compel a man to do or not to do some thing or to carry out a\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\nThe other basic principle affecting all questions of labor law is that\r\nof freedom of trade or labor, correlative to the principle of freedom\r\nof contract as to property right, and, indeed, embodying that notion\r\nalso. That is to say (perhaps I should say, to repeat) that an\r\nEnglishman, an American, has a right to labor where and for whom and\r\nat what he will, and freely to make contract for such labor, and\r\nfreely to exercise all trades, and not to be combined against by\r\nothers, or competed with by a monopoly favored by the state. These\r\nlast two clauses, of course, belong to our next chapter. This right of\r\ncontract is not peculiar to the English law, as is the right not to be\r\ncompelled to personal service, and is much better understood; though\r\nit is still earnestly argued by many advocates of union labor that\r\nthere is no real freedom of contract, or, at least, equality of\r\ncontract, between the employer and the employee; that therefore\r\n\"collective bargaining\" should be allowed, and that therefore, and\r\nfurthermore, the wiser or the better organized should be permitted to\r\ncombine to control the contract or the labor of the individual. But if\r\nwe hold thoroughly these two principles before our mind we shall have\r\nthe key to the understanding of our labor legislation; and if we add\r\nto that the third principle against conspiracy, we shall have the key\r\nto our more complicated legislation against trusts and blacklists and\r\nboycotts, and to an understanding of the more difficult questions,\r\naffecting labor in combination and the regulation of labor unions.\r\n\r\nThat there has been a vast deal of interference, or attempted\r\ninterference, with these principles in modern American legislation\r\ngoes without saying. The motive or force behind such legislation has\r\npretty clearly two sources: First, the behest or desire of the \"Labor\r\ninterest\" or organized labor, the trades-unions themselves; and when\r\nwe analyze these and their constituents we shall find that it really\r\nmeans only mechanical or industrial labor, not farm or agricultural\r\nlabor (which is still in numbers the greatest body of labor in the\r\nUnited States), nor, as yet, domestic service labor, nor what the\r\ncensus calls \"personal service,\" which is probably next in numerical\r\nimportance, nor clerks; it is a comparatively small class in numbers,\r\nthis class of skilled mechanical or manufacturing labor, that has\r\nbrought about this immense mass of legislation of our modern States\r\naimed at improving their own labor conditions; and which therefore,\r\nnecessarily perhaps, interferes with personal liberty as to the labor\r\ncontract, or, at least, seeks to regulate it.\r\n\r\nThe other great influence is rather a motive than a source; we may\r\ncall it, for want of a better word, the sentimental or the altruistic\r\nmotive--the moral motive; the forces behind it being mainly of a\r\nreligious or moral origin, philanthropists, students of ethics, and\r\nrecently, to a great extent, the women and the women's clubs. The\r\nactivity of these great forces may be clearly traced through the\r\nnineteenth century. It first belonged to the antislavery movement,\r\nwhich directly and historically led to the women's suffrage movement,\r\nowing to the fact that at a great antislavery convention in England\r\na woman delegate was refused a seat upon the platform, while her\r\nhusband, a comparatively obscure person, was recognized as the\r\nleading representative from America; and ending of late years in\r\nthe prohibition movement, to regulate or prohibit the trade in\r\nintoxicating liquors, and to exclude the canteen from the army. But in\r\nthe latest years, in these last very few years indeed, the forces of\r\nthis category have devoted a large proportion of their \"categorical\r\nimperative\" to labor conditions and the labor contract.\r\n\r\nThese great forces are entirely impatient of constitutional principles\r\nand somewhat indifferent as to the law, while always very desirous\r\nof making new statutes themselves. But their combined influence is\r\nenormous, so much so that almost any cause to which they devote\r\nthemselves will in the long run succeed; unless, indeed, their\r\nattention is diverted to some other need, for it may be suggested that\r\nthey are somewhat fickle of purpose. For example, their success in\r\nthe antislavery movement makes the American history of the nineteenth\r\ncentury; in the prohibition movement they were, in the middle decades\r\nof that century, almost entirely successful, and while apparently\r\nthere was a set-back in the twenty years of individualistic feeling\r\nwhich marked the growth of the Democratic party to an equality with\r\nits great rival, the movement of late years seems to have taken on\r\nrenewed strength, probably on account of the so-called negro question\r\nin the South. And while, as to votes for women, they seem to have made\r\nno progress beyond the adoption twenty years ago of women's suffrage\r\nin four new Western States and Territories, this last year, it must be\r\nadmitted, the movement has taken on a new strength in sympathy with\r\nthe agitation in England. There are now already symptoms of a fourth\r\ncause--the reform of marriage, divorce and the laws regulating\r\ndomestic relations, and the control of children. It is possible that\r\nthese matters will be taken up actively in coming decades, and we,\r\ntherefore, reserve them for a future chapter; this new effort is\r\nitself partly bound up with the women's suffrage movement, and in its\r\nlatest manifestation--that of proposing legislation preventing\r\nmen from marrying without permission from the state--it is a most\r\npicturesque example of that absence of constitutional feeling we have\r\njust adverted to.\r\n\r\nNow this freedom-of-contract principle is one which, of course,\r\nlegislation attempting to regulate the labor contract is peculiarly\r\nliable to \"run up against\"; and it is, for this reason, not only or\r\nchiefly because \"labor\" is opposed to the Constitution or because the\r\ncourts are opposed to \"labor,\" that so many statutes, passed at\r\nleast nominally in the interest of labor, have been by them declared\r\nunconstitutional. For instance, it is a primary principle that an\r\nEnglish free man of full age, under no disability, may control his\r\nperson and his personal activities. He can work six, or four, or\r\neight, or ten, or twelve, or twenty-four, or no hours a day if he\r\nchoose, and any attempt to control him is impossible under the\r\nsimplest principle of Anglo-Saxon liberty. Yet there is possibly a\r\nmajority of the members of the labor unions who would wish to control\r\nhim in this particular to-day; and will take for an example that\r\nunder the police power the state has been permitted to control him in\r\nmatters affecting the public health or safety, as, for instance, in\r\nthe running of railway trains, or, in Utah, in labor in the mines. But\r\nfreedom of contract in this connection results generally from personal\r\nliberty itself; although it results also from the right to property;\r\nthat is to say, a man's wages (or his trade, for matter of that) is\r\nhis property, and the right of property is of no practical use if you\r\ncannot have the right to make contracts concerning it.\r\n\r\nThe only matter more important doubtless in the laborer's eye than the\r\nlength of time he shall work is the amount of wages he shall receive.\r\nNow we may say at the start that in the English-speaking world there\r\nhas been practically no attempt to regulate the _amount_ of wages. We\r\nfound such legislation in mediaeval England, and we also found that\r\nit was abandoned with general consent. But of late years in these\r\nsocialistic days (using again socialistic in its proper sense of that\r\nwhich controls personal liberty for the interest of the community or\r\nstate) it is surprisingly showing its head once more. In Australasia\r\nand more recently in England we see the beginning of a minimum wage\r\nsystem which we must most carefully describe before we leave the\r\nsubject. There was in the State of Indiana a law that in ordinary\r\nunskilled labor in public employment there should be a minimum wage of\r\nfifteen cents per hour or twenty-five cents for a man and horse--since\r\ndeclared unconstitutional by Indiana courts: while to-day such labor\r\nreceives a minimum of two dollars per day in California and Nebraska,\r\none dollar and a quarter in Hawaii, three dollars in Nevada, and\r\n\"the usual rate\" in Delaware and New York,[1] and we are many of us\r\nfamiliar with the practice of towns and villages in New England or New\r\nYork in passing a vote or town ordinance fixing the price of wages\r\nat two dollars per day, or a like sum; but this practice, it must be\r\nremarked, is in no sense a _law_ regulating wages; it is merely the\r\nresolution or resolve of an employer himself, as a private citizen\r\nmight say that he would give his gardener fifty dollars a month\r\ninstead of forty. And, on the other hand, the Constitution of\r\nLouisiana provides that the price of wages shall never be fixed by\r\nlaw. Now it will be remembered that the Statutes of Laborers of the\r\nMiddle Ages, when they regulated the price of wages, led directly to\r\nthe result that they made all strikes, all concerted efforts to get an\r\nincrease of wages, unlawful and even criminal; in fact, it may be said\r\nthat this attempt to bind the workmen to a wage fixed by law was the\r\nvery cause of the notion that strikes were illegal, which, indeed, was\r\nthe English common law down to early in the last century. Moreover,\r\nwhen an English mediaeval peasant refused to labor for his three pence\r\na day he might be sent to gaol by the nearest justice of the peace,\r\nas, perhaps, some employers would like to do to-day in our South, and\r\nwhich resulted--if not in slavery--in precisely that condition which\r\nwe call \"peonage.\" Economically speaking, the attempt to regulate\r\nwages was, of course, a mistake; politically speaking, it was\r\nuniversally unpopular, and no class was more desirous than the working\r\nclass themselves of getting rid of all such legislation, which they\r\ndid in France at the French Revolution, and in England nearly two\r\ncenturies earlier. Only socialists should logically desire to go back\r\nto the system, and in the one modern English-speaking State which is\r\nlargely socialistic--New Zealand--it is said that the minimum wage law\r\nhas had the effect that a similar resolve has had in Massachusetts\r\ntowns: to drive all the old men and all the weaker or less skilled out\r\nof employment entirely, and into the poorhouse;[2] for, at a fixed\r\nprice, it is obvious that the employer will employ only the most\r\nefficient labor, and the same argument causes some of their more\r\nthoughtful friends to dissuade the women school-teachers in New York\r\nfrom their present effort to get their wages or salaries fixed by law\r\nat a price equal to that paid a man.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See above, p. 161; below, p. 213.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In the old town of Plymouth the chairman of the selectmen\r\nasked what, he should do under vote of town meeting requiring him to\r\npay two dollars a day for all unskilled labor employed by the town.\r\n\"We have,\" he said, \"about one hundred and twenty old men in Plymouth,\r\nlargely veterans of the Civil War. We have been in the habit of giving\r\nthem one dollar and a quarter per day. Under this two-dollar vote we\r\ncannot do it without bankrupting the town.\" He was advised to go ahead\r\nand still pay them the dollar and a quarter per day and take the\r\nchance of a lawsuit, which he did, and so far as the writer knows no\r\nlawsuit has ever been brought; but in all cases that would not be the\r\nresult.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: This is law in Utah; but nevertheless a letter from a\r\nState government official informs me that women are willing to [and\r\ndo?] work for a smaller salary.]\r\n\r\nA principle somewhat akin to that of a vote of a town fixing the rate\r\nof wages is the recent constitutional amendment in the State of New\r\nYork (see above, p. 161) which validated the statute requiring that in\r\npublic work (that is to say, labor for the State, for cities, towns,\r\ncounties, villages, school districts, or any municipality of the\r\nState), or _for contractors employed directly or indirectly by the\r\nState or such municipality_, that rate shall be paid which is usual\r\nat the time in the same trade in the same neighborhood. This was the\r\nearliest statute, which was declared unconstitutional (see above, p.\r\n161). The lack of interest in this tremendously important matter is\r\nshown in the fact that not one-third of the voters took the trouble\r\nto vote on the amendment at all, and that for three days after the\r\nelection no New York newspaper took notice of the fact that the\r\namendment had passed. Up to this constitutional amendment the courts\r\nof New York, as well as those of California and even of the United\r\nStates, had resented with great vigor the attempt of statutes to make\r\na crime the permitting of a free American citizen to work over eight\r\nhours if he liked so to do. But in New York at least (now followed\r\nin Delaware, Maryland, and Oklahoma) it is now settled that so much\r\ninterference even with the rate of wages may be allowed, and as the\r\npercentage of public employment is, of course, very large--covering as\r\nit does not only all public contractors, but all labor in or for gaols\r\nor public institutions--it will necessarily, it would seem, drag with\r\nit a certain practical regulation of private industry corresponding to\r\nthe public rules.\r\n\r\nIn England, the New Zealand experiment has been tentatively begun;\r\nthat is to say, in the last radical Parliament, in the autumn of 1909,\r\nthe law was enacted, already referred to, for fixing wages by mixed\r\ncommission (see above, p. 159); but otherwise than as above there is\r\nin the States and Territories of the United States, and in the United\r\nStates itself, no regulation of wages, even of women or children, and\r\nno attempt, as yet, at a minimum wage law.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to hours, the matter is very different. In the first\r\nplace, we must be reminded that without a constitutional amendment\r\nyou cannot have any direct or indirect legislation, as to general\r\noccupations, on the hours of labor of a man of full age.[1] You can\r\nhave regulation of the hours of labor of a woman of full age\r\nin general employments, by court decision, in three States\r\n(Massachusetts, Oregon, and Illinois), the Massachusetts decision,\r\ncarelessly rendered in 1876, without citing any authority whatever,[2]\r\nbeing based apparently on a vague notion of general sanitary reasons,\r\nwithout argument or apparently due consideration of the historical and\r\nconstitutional law; but the Oregon case,[3] decided both by the State\r\nSupreme Court and by the Federal Court in so far as the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment was concerned, after most careful and thorough discussion\r\nand reasoning, reasserted the principle that a woman is the ward of\r\nthe state, and therefore does not have the full liberty of contract\r\nallowed to a man. Whether this decision will or will not be pleasing\r\nto the leaders of feminist thought is a matter of considerable\r\ninterest. A similar statute in Illinois had been declared\r\nunconstitutional twenty years before, largely on the ground that\r\nto limit or prohibit the labor of woman would handicap her in her\r\nindustrial competition with man, pointing out also that the Illinois\r\nConstitution itself prescribes and requires that the rights of the\r\nsexes should in all respects be identical, save only in so far as jury\r\nand militia service and political rights were concerned. A new statute\r\nsince the Oregon decision has been passed in Illinois and the law was\r\nsustained, reversing the older case. On the other hand New York courts\r\ntake a position squarely contrary,[4] and so in Colorado.[5] The\r\nconstitutional justification of these decisions must probably be\r\nthat the health not only of the women themselves, but of the general\r\npublic, or at least of posterity, is concerned, for, as we shall find\r\nmore particularly when we discuss general legislation on the police\r\npower, to justify an interference with personal liberty of freemen\r\nthere must, under English ideas, be a motive based upon the health,\r\nsafety, and well-being of all of the whole community, not merely\r\nof the particular citizen concerned. He has the right to work in\r\nunhealthy trades at unhealthy times, or under unhealthy conditions,\r\njust as he has the right to consume unhealthy food and drink. If it be\r\nprohibited, it must be prohibited when it has a direct relation to the\r\ngeneral welfare. For example, a railway engineer may be prohibited\r\nfrom working continuously for more than sixteen hours, for that is\r\na direct danger to the safety of the public; but a man may not\r\nbe prohibited from taking service for long hours as stoker on a\r\nsteamship, although the life of a stoker be a short one and not over\r\nmerry. Apparently, however, a woman can be; and indeed there have for\r\na long time been laws prohibiting the labor of women in England and\r\nregulating their hours. But then there are laws prohibiting women from\r\nserving in immoral occupations, or occupations which are supposed to\r\nbe dangerous to their morals, as, for instance, many States have laws\r\nagainst the serving of liquor, or even of food, by women or girls in\r\nplaces or restaurants where liquor is served, or for certain hours, or\r\nin certain places. Very conceivably a law might be passed prohibiting\r\nwomen and girls from the selling of programmes, or attending upon dime\r\nmuseums, or even selling newspapers, or being district messengers;\r\nbut, as we all know, there are women cabmen in Paris. Would\r\nlegislation prohibiting such employment to women be unconstitutional?\r\nThere is already a considerable amount of it. The cases are\r\nconflicting, the earlier view, and the view taken in the South and in\r\nat least one Federal court, being that such laws are unconstitutional.\r\nThe modern doctrine, backed up by that public opinion which we have\r\nabove described as the ethical force, would seem to sustain them. The\r\ntruth is probably that the legislature must be the sole judge of the\r\nexpediency of such legislation; where the court can see that it does\r\nbear a direct relation to the morals of the young women concerned,\r\nor the morals of the general community, it will be sustained as\r\nconstitutional under the police power, although to that extent\r\ninterfering with the personal liberty of women and with their means of\r\ngetting a livelihood.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Georgia and South Carolina have such law requiring\r\nsixty-six and sixty hours a week respectively in cotton and woollen\r\nmanufacturing; but their constitutionality has never been tested. For\r\n_public_ work, see below.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Commonwealth _v._ Hamilton Manufacturing Co. 120 Mass.\r\n383.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Muller _v._ Oregon, 208 U.S. 412. So in Pennsylvania:\r\nCommonwealth _v._ Beatty, 23 Penn. C.C. 300.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: People _v._ Williams, 81 N.E. 778.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Bucher _v._ People, 93 Pac. 14.]\r\n\r\nAs to children there is, of course, no question. Laws limiting their\r\nlabor are perfectly constitutional, and some child-labor laws exist\r\nalready in all States and Territories except Nevada. The only dispute\r\non the child-labor question is whether such legislation should be\r\nFederal, or rather whether the Constitution should be so amended as to\r\nmake Federal legislation possible. Practically this would meet with\r\na very much wider opposition than is commonly supposed. The writer,\r\nacting as chairman of the National Conference of Commissioners on\r\nUniformity of Legislation appointed under laws of more than thirty\r\nStates of the Union and meeting in Detroit, Michigan, in 1895, brought\r\nthis matter up under a resolution of the Legislature of the State of\r\nMassachusetts requesting him to do so. Nearly every Southern delegate\r\nand most of those from the West and from the Middle States were on\r\ntheir feet at once objecting, and the best he could do was to get\r\nit referred to a committee rather than have the Commonwealth of\r\nMassachusetts summarily snubbed. This committee, of course, never\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nUndoubtedly climatic effects, social conditions, and dozens of other\r\nreasons make it difficult, if not unwise, to attempt to have the same\r\nrules as to hours of labor in all the States of our wide country. Boys\r\nand notably girls mature much earlier in the South than they do in\r\nthe North; schooling conditions are not the same, homes are not so\r\ncomfortable, the money may be more needed, the general level of\r\neducation is less. Doubtless there are still areas in the South where\r\non the whole it is better for a child of fourteen to be in a cotton\r\nmill than anywhere else he is likely to go, schools not existing. The\r\nSouthern delegates resented interference with their State police power\r\nfor these reasons. The Massachusetts Legislature, on the other hand,\r\nhad in mind the competition of Southern mills, with cheap child labor,\r\nquite as much as any desire to benefit the white or negro children\r\nof the South; but the writer's experience convinced him that a\r\nconstitutional amendment on this point is impossible, although one has\r\nbeen repeatedly proposed, notably by the late Congressman Lovering of\r\nMassachusetts, and such an amendment is still pending somewhere in\r\nthat limbo of unadopted constitutional amendments for which no formal\r\ncemetery seems to have been prepared.\r\n\r\nEven as to men, the labor of the Southern States is notably different\r\nfrom the labor of Lowell or Lawrence, Massachusetts, or even\r\nCambridge; while on the Panama Canal or in most tropical countries the\r\nordinary laborer likes to pretend that he is working eighteen hours\r\na day, although most of the time is spent in eating or sleeping.\r\nNevertheless, under the Federal law, all employees at Panama have\r\nto be given the eight-hour day required by the Federal statute, the\r\nSupreme Court having upheld that act as constitutional.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note, in passing, the alignment of our courts upon\r\nthis subject of hours of labor and general interference with the\r\nfreedom of contract of employment. The Western and Southern States\r\nare most conservative; that is to say, most severe in enforcing the\r\nconstitutional principles of liberty of contract as against any\r\nstatute. The courts of the North and East are more radical, and the\r\ncourts of Massachusetts and the United States most radical of all. I\r\naccount for this fact on the ground that where the legislatures are\r\nover-radical, the courts tend to react into conservatism, and as the\r\nWestern legislatures try many more startling experiments than are\r\nusually attempted in Massachusetts or New Jersey, the more intelligent\r\npublic opinion has to depend on the courts to apply the curb.\r\nAll this, of course, is a great mistake; for it forces undue\r\nresponsibility on the courts, at least tends to control in an improper\r\nway the appointment of judges, and at best forces the most upright\r\njudge into a position where he should not be put--that of being a kind\r\nof king or lord chamberlain, with power to set aside improper or wrong\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary remarks we are now prepared to examine the\r\nlegislation as it exists to-day (1910); cautioning our readers that\r\nthis subject, as indeed all others concerning labor legislation, is so\r\noften tinkered in all our States as to make our statements of little\r\npermanent value, except that restrictions once imposed are rarely\r\nrepealed. We may assume, therefore, that the law is at least as\r\nradical as it is herein presented.\r\n\r\nThe hours of labor of _adults_, males, in ordinary industries remain\r\nas yet unrestricted by law in any State of the Union; but several\r\nStates have laws making a certain number of hours a day's work in the\r\nabsence of contract;[1] and New York and a few other States have an\r\neight-hour day in \"public\" work--that is to say, work directly for\r\nthe State or any municipality or for a contractor undertaking such\r\nwork.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Thus eight hours (California, Connecticut, Illinois,\r\nIndiana, Missouri, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin); ten hours\r\n(Florida, Maine, Michigan--with pay for overtime--Minnesota, Montana,\r\nMaryland--for manufacturing corporations--Nebraska, New Hampshire,\r\nRhode Island, South Carolina--in cotton and woollen mills--in New\r\nJersey), fifty-five hours a week in factories; in Georgia eleven hours\r\nin manufacturing establishments, or from sunrise to sunset by all\r\npersons under twenty-one, mealtimes excluded (see below). But these\r\nlaws do not usually apply to agricultural or domestic employment or to\r\npersons hired by the month.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: In public work, that is, work done for the State, or any\r\ncounty or municipality or for contractors therefor, the eight-hour day\r\nis prescribed (California, Colorado, Delaware, District of Columbia,\r\nHawaii, Idaho, Indiana, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota,\r\nMontana, Nebraska, Nevada, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania,\r\nPorto Rico, Utah, Washington, West Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming, and\r\nthe United States). But the provisions for overtime and compensation\r\nfor overtime differ considerably.]\r\n\r\nThe labor of women (in mechanical trades, factories and laundries in\r\nIllinois, or in mercantile, hotel, telegraph, telephone, etc., as\r\nwell, in Oregon) for more than a limit of ten hours per day in\r\nIllinois, or nine in Oregon, is prohibited and made a misdemeanor; and\r\nboth these statutes have been held constitutional. But in many\r\nother States the hours of labor in factories or manufacturing\r\nestablishments, even of adult women, are now regulated; while the\r\nlabor of children, as we shall find, is regulated in nearly all. Thus,\r\nConnecticut, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New York, North Dakota, Oklahoma,\r\nOregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South Dakota, Tennessee, Virginia,\r\nand Washington have a ten-hour day in all manufacturing or mechanical\r\nemployments for women of any age, which in Connecticut, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Oregon, Pennsylvania, and\r\nWashington extends to mercantile avocations also, in Louisiana only\r\nto specified dangerous trades; in Wisconsin, eight hours; and in\r\nConnecticut, Maine, Minnesota, New Hampshire there may not be more\r\nthan fifty-eight hours a week, or in Massachusetts and Rhode Island,\r\nfifty-six, and in Michigan and Missouri, fifty-four. Arizona has an\r\neight-hour day in laundries.\r\n\r\nAnd these laws are extended to specified occupations, viz., in\r\nConnecticut to manufacturing, mechanical, and mercantile; in Illinois,\r\nmechanical, factory, or laundry; in Louisiana, unhealthful or\r\ndangerous occupations except agricultural or domestic; in Maine,\r\nmechanical and manufacturing except of perishable products; in\r\nMaryland, special kinds of manufactories; in Massachusetts,\r\nmanufacturing, mechanical, mercantile, and restaurants; in Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, and Missouri, manufacturing, mechanical, and mercantile\r\nor laundries; in Nebraska, manufacturing, mercantile, hotel, or\r\nrestaurant; in New Hampshire, New York,[1] North Dakota, Oklahoma,\r\nRhode Island, manufacturing and mechanical; in Tennessee and\r\nVirginia, manufacturing only; in Washington and Oregon manufacturing,\r\nmechanical, mercantile, laundry, hotel, or restaurant, and in\r\nWisconsin, mechanical or manufacturing. Georgia and South Carolina\r\nregulate the labor of women as they do of adult men[2] in factories.\r\nSuch laws of course would not be unconstitutional or, if so, not for\r\nthe reason of sex discrimination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Possibly unconstitutional. See above.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See above.]\r\n\r\nNow all these laws arbitrarily regulate the hours of labor of women\r\nat any season without regard to their condition of health, and are\r\ntherefore far behind the more intelligent legislation of Belgium,\r\nFrance, and Germany, which considers at all times their sanitary\r\ncondition, and requires a period of rest for some weeks before and\r\nafter childbirth. The best that can be said of them, therefore, is\r\nthat they are a beginning. No law has attempted to prescribe the\r\nsocial condition of female industrial laborers, the bill introduced in\r\nConnecticut that no married woman should ever be allowed to work in\r\nfactories having failed in its passage.\r\n\r\nThe hours of labor of minors, male and female, are limited in all\r\nStates, except Florida, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada, New\r\nMexico, South Carolina, Texas, Vermont, Utah, Washington, West\r\nVirginia, and Wyoming, particularly in factories and stores, usually\r\nunder an age limit of sixteen, to ten hours per day or fifty-eight\r\nhours a week.[1] But in Alabama, Arkansas, and Virginia, the age is as\r\nlow as fourteen, and in California, Indiana,[2] Louisiana, Maine,[2]\r\nMassachusetts, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio,[2] Pennsylvania,[2] and\r\nSouth Dakota,[2] it is eighteen. In California, Delaware, Idaho, and\r\nNew York, it is nine hours, and in Colorado, District of Columbia,\r\nIllinois, Indiana, Kansas, New York,[3] North Dakota, Ohio, and\r\nOklahoma, it is as low as eight hours a day, though the laws in\r\nseveral States, as in New York, are contrary and overlie each other. A\r\ncorresponding limit, but sometimes less, is fixed for the week; that\r\nis, in the nine-hour States and some others, weekly labor may not\r\nexceed fifty-four hours or less.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts (in manufacturing,\r\nfifty-six), Mississippi, New Hampshire (nine hours, forty minutes),\r\nPennsylvania. In others, sixty hours a week (Alabama, Arkansas,\r\nIndiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Maryland (in Baltimore only), Minnesota, New\r\nYork, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Wisconsin).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: As to females only (Indiana, Maine, Ohio, Pennsylvania,\r\nSouth Dakota).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In factories (New York).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Fifty-four hours (Delaware, Idaho, Michigan, New York),\r\nfifty-five hours (New Jersey), fifty-six hours (Massachusetts, Rhode\r\nIsland), forty-eight hours (District of Columbia, Illinois, Kansas,\r\nOhio, Oklahoma), sixty-six hours (North Carolina).]\r\n\r\nNight work in factories, etc., is prohibited in nearly all the States\r\nmentioned and in others.[1] Many States require working papers or\r\ncertificates of age of the person employed, and there are often also\r\ncertificates as to the required amount of schooling when necessary.\r\nIndeed it may be said that we are on the way to the German system of\r\nhaving time cards or certificates furnished by State machinery for all\r\nindustrial workers, and such a system will, of course, be absolutely\r\nnecessary should the State ever engage in old-age insurance, as has\r\nbeen done in Germany and England; though the practical difficulty of\r\nsuch a scheme would have been thought by our fathers insuperable\r\non account of our Federal and State system of government, and the\r\nnecessary free immigration of American workmen from one State into\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Thus, night labor in factories to minors under fourteen\r\n(Arkansas, Georgia, Massachusetts, North Carolina, Texas, Virginia),\r\ntwelve (South Carolina), eighteen (New Jersey), or sixteen (Alabama,\r\nCalifornia, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Idaho,\r\nIllinois, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota,\r\nMississippi, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont, Wisconsin) is prohibited in\r\nfactories or mercantile establishments (Connecticut, Iowa, Kansas,\r\nMichigan, New York), or any gainful occupation (Delaware, District\r\nof Columbia, Idaho, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Minnesota, North\r\nCarolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode\r\nIsland, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin). In South Carolina the law\r\nonly protects children under twelve from night labor in mines and\r\nfactories. So in some as to all females only (Indiana), females\r\nunder eighteen (Louisiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania),\r\ntwenty-one (New York), and to any minor between 10 P.M. and 6 A.M.\r\n(Massachusetts).]\r\n\r\nThese laws will be found summarized in full in _Legislative Review_,\r\nNo. 5, of the American Association for Labor Legislation, by Laura\r\nScott (\"Child Labor\"), and in No. 4, by Maud Swett (\"Woman's Work\").\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in all respects practicable with our necessary\r\nsystem of individual liberty, doubly guaranteed by the constitutions,\r\nState and Federal, we are quite abreast of the more intelligent\r\nlegislation of European countries as to hours of labor, women's and\r\nchildren's, except in a few States. But it should be remembered that\r\nthese are largely agricultural or mining States, and doubtless when\r\nthe abuse of child and woman labor presents itself it will be met as\r\nfrankly and fairly there as in others.\r\n\r\nOn the constitutionality, if not the economic wisdom of laws\r\nregulating the hours of labor of women, at least of adult years, there\r\nstill is decided difference of opinion. Logically it would perhaps\r\nseem as if those who believe in the \"Woman's Rights\" movement of\r\nuniform function for women and men, should be opposed to all such\r\nlegislation; both on theoretical grounds as being a restraint of\r\npersonal liberty, and as unequal legislation handicapping woman in her\r\nindustrial competition with man. This was certainly the earlier\r\nview; but under the influence of certain voluntary philanthropic\r\nassociations the tendency at present seems to be the other way.\r\n\r\nThe States which have laws prohibiting any labor of children whatever,\r\neven, apparently, agricultural or domestic,[1] are: Arizona, Arkansas,\r\nConnecticut, Colorado, Delaware, Florida, Idaho, Illinois, Kansas,\r\nKentucky, Maryland, Missouri, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana,\r\nNebraska, New York, North Dakota, Oregon, Washington, and Wisconsin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The New York law applies to \"any business or service,\"\r\nbut I assume this cannot mean service rendered to the parents in the\r\nhouse or on the farm; in fact it may be generally assumed that all\r\nthese laws, even when they do not say so, mean only employment for\r\nhire; the Oregon and Wisconsin laws, to \"any work for compensation\";\r\nthe Washington law to \"any inside employment, factory, mine, shop,\r\nstore, except farm or household work.\" Arkansas, Delaware, Idaho, and\r\nWisconsin, to \"any gainful occupation\"; Maryland, to \"any business,\"\r\netc., except farm labor in summer; Colorado, to labor for\r\ncorporations, firms, or persons; the other State laws to any work.]\r\n\r\nAnd the age limit fixed for such general employment is (without regard\r\nto schooling) under twelve, in Idaho and Maryland; under fourteen in\r\nDelaware, Illinois, and Wisconsin; and under fourteen for boys and\r\nsixteen for girls in Washington, if without permit, and under fifteen,\r\nfor more than sixty days without the consent of the parent or guardian\r\nin Florida; in other States the prohibition rests on educational\r\nreasons, and covers only the time of year during which schools are in\r\nsession; thus, under eight during school hours, or fourteen without\r\ncertificate (Missouri); under fourteen during the time or term of\r\nschool sessions (Connecticut, Colorado,[1] Massachusetts, Idaho,\r\nKansas, Kentucky, Minnesota, New York, North Dakota); or under\r\nfourteen during actual school hours (Arizona,[2] Kentucky, Nebraska,\r\nOregon); or under fifteen in Washington,[1] and under sixteen as\r\nto those who cannot read and write (Colorado, Connecticut,[3]\r\nIllinois,[3],[4]) or have not the required school instruction (Idaho,\r\nNew York[1],[4]), or during school hours (Arkansas, Montana[1]), or\r\nwho have not a labor permit (Maryland, Minnesota, Wisconsin). This\r\nrésumé shows a pretty general agreement on the absolute prohibition of\r\nchild labor under fourteen, or under sixteen as to the uneducated; and\r\nthe penalty is in most States only a fine inflicted on the employer,\r\nor, in some cases, the parent; but in Florida and Wisconsin it may be\r\nimprisonment; as it is in Alabama for a second offence.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Without schooling certificate.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Without certificate of excuse.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Unless the child attends a night school.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Without age certificate.]\r\n\r\nBut more States fix a limit of age in the employment of children in\r\nfactories or workshops, and particularly in mines; not so usually,\r\nhowever, in stores.[1] The age of absolute prohibition is usually\r\nfixed at fourteen or at sixteen in the absence of a certain amount of\r\ncommon-school education. These States are: Alabama,[2] Arkansas,[3,9]\r\nCalifornia,[4,9] Colorado,[5] Connecticut,[5] Delaware,[5,6]\r\nDistrict of Columbia,[7,9] Florida,[3,9] Georgia,[8] Illinois,[5,9]\r\nIndiana,[9,10] Iowa.[11,9] Kansas and Kentucky[8] forbid factory labor\r\nfor children under fourteen or between fourteen and sixteen without\r\nan age certificate or an employment certificate; Louisiana[9] has the\r\nusual statute, that is, absolute prohibition under fourteen and age\r\ncertificate required for those between fourteen and sixteen, or, in\r\nthe case of girls, between fourteen and eighteen, and the law applies\r\nto mercantile occupations where more than five persons are employed;\r\nthe Maine statute is similar, but children above fifteen may work in\r\nmercantile establishments without age or schooling certificate, which\r\nis required of all those under sixteen in manufacturing or mechanical\r\nemployment; in Maryland,[12] the prohibition age is still twelve, and\r\nthe law applies to any business except farm labor in the summer; in\r\nMassachusetts,[12] absolute prohibition below fourteen, fourteen\r\nto sixteen without age or schooling certificate, and fourteen to\r\neighteen, who cannot read and write; in Michigan,[12] absolute\r\nprohibition under fourteen, or sixteen without written permit; in\r\nMinnesota, the same ages, but the law applies to any employment; in\r\nMississippi the ages are twelve and sixteen; in Missouri, absolute\r\nprohibition under eight, or fourteen without school certificate. New\r\nHampshire[12] lags behind and has only an absolute prohibition to\r\nchildren under twelve, or during school under fourteen, or under\r\nsixteen without schooling certificate. In New Jersey, under fourteen,\r\nor sixteen with medical certificate; Nebraska[l2] and New York,[12]\r\nthe usual absolute prohibition under fourteen, or under sixteen\r\nwithout employment certificate; North Carolina, under twelve, with an\r\nexception of oyster industries; North Dakota,[12] fourteen, or from\r\nfourteen to sixteen without employment certificate. In Ohio,[12]\r\nOklahoma, Oregon,[12] Pennsylvania,[12] and Rhode Island,[12] the laws\r\nare practically identical, fourteen, or sixteen with certificate of\r\nschooling. South Carolina, absolute prohibition only under twelve, and\r\nnot even then in textile establishments if the child has a dependency\r\ncertificate. South Dakota,[12] under fifteen when school is in\r\nsession; Tennessee, absolute under fourteen; Texas, under twelve, or\r\nunder fourteen to those who cannot read and write unless the child has\r\na parent to support. Vermont's limitation is purely educational; no\r\nchild under sixteen can be employed in factories or mines who has not\r\ncompleted nine years of study. In Virginia[12] from March 1, 1910,\r\nthere is absolute prohibition under fourteen except as to children\r\nbetween twelve and fourteen with a dependency certificate; Washington,\r\nunder fifteen without schooling certificate, or in stores, etc.,\r\ntwelve. West Virginia, twelve, or fourteen when school is in session.\r\nUtah and Wyoming have no legislation except as to mines, nor do\r\nColorado and Idaho protect women in them. Yet these are the four\r\nwoman-suffrage States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The law does apply to \"mercantile establishments\"\r\n(Alabama, Arkansas, California, District of Columbia, Florida,\r\nIllinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Missouri, Nebraska, New York, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon,\r\nPennsylvania, Rhode Island, Virginia, West Virginia).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Absolute prohibition only under twelve.

Female labor is absolutely forbidden in mines or works\r\nunderground in Alabama, Arkansas, Illinois, Indiana, Missouri, New\r\nYork, North Carolina, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, Utah, Washington,\r\nWyoming, and West Virginia,--in short, in most of the States except\r\nIdaho, Kansas, Iowa, Kentucky, Virginia, Wyoming, where mines exist;\r\nand the limit of male labor is usually put at from fourteen. (Alabama,\r\nArkansas, Idaho, Indiana, Missouri, Ohio,[1] South Dakota, Tennessee,\r\nUtah, Wyoming) to sixteen (Illinois, Missouri,[2] Montana, New York,\r\nOklahoma, Pennsylvania, Washington); or twelve (North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, West Virginia), even in States which have no such\r\nlegislation as to factories.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fifteen during school year.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Of those who can read and write.]\r\n\r\nThe laws as to elevators,[1] dangerous machinery,[2] or dangerous\r\nemployment generally,[3] are even stricter, and as a rule apply to\r\nchildren of both sexes; the Massachusetts standard being, in the\r\nmanagement of rapid elevators, the age of eighteen, in cleaning\r\nmachinery in motion, fourteen, etc.; in other States, sixteen to\r\neighteen.[4] The labor of all women in some States, and of girls or\r\nwomen under sixteen or eighteen in other States, is forbidden in\r\noccupations which require continual standing.[5] Females,[6] or\r\nminors,[7] or young children[8] are very generally forbidden from\r\nworking or waiting in bar-rooms or restaurants where liquor is sold,\r\nand in a few States girls are prohibited from selling newspapers or\r\nacting as messengers.[9] The Northern States have a usual age limit\r\nfor the employment of children in ordinary theatrical performances,\r\nand an absolute prohibition of such employment or of acrobatic,\r\nimmoral, or mendicant employment. But in some States it appears there\r\nis only an age limit as to these.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Indiana, Massachusetts, New York, Rhode Island, Kansas,\r\nOregon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Connecticut, Iowa, Missouri, Oregon, Louisiana, New\r\nYork.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Illinois, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Michigan,\r\nMinnesota, Missouri, Montana, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma,\r\nPennsylvania, Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, South\r\nCarolina.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Illinois (under sixteen), Michigan (all), Minnesota\r\n(sixteen), Missouri (all), New York (sixteen), Ohio (all), Oklahoma\r\n(sixteen), Wisconsin (sixteen), Colorado (all over sixteen).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, New\r\nYork, Vermont, Washington (except the wife of the proprietor or a\r\nmember of the family).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia, Pennsylvania, Idaho,\r\nMaryland, Michigan, Missouri, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Vermont.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: Florida, Illinois, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: New York, Oklahoma, Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: California, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Michigan,\r\nMissouri, Montana, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, (sixteen years);\r\nColorado, District of Columbia, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, New\r\nHampshire, Virginia, Wisconsin, Wyoming (fourteen); Connecticut,\r\nGeorgia, (twelve); Delaware, Indiana, Louisiana, Massachusetts, West\r\nVirginia (fifteen); Minnesota, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Washington\r\n(eighteen).]\r\n\r\nThe hours for railroad and telegraph operators are limited in several\r\nStates, but rather for the purpose of protecting the public safety\r\nthan the employees themselves.[1] The following other trades are\r\nprohibited to women or girls: Boot-blacking,[2] or street trades\r\ngenerally;[3] work upon emery wheels, or wheels of any description in\r\nfactories (Michigan), and in New York no female is allowed to operate\r\nor use abrasives, buffing wheels, or many other processes of polishing\r\nthe baser metals, or iridium; selling magazines or newspapers in any\r\npublic place, as to girls under sixteen,[4] public messenger service\r\nfor telegraph and telephone companies as to girls under nineteen.[5]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Colorado, New York.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: District of Columbia, Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: District of Columbia, Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: New York, Oklahoma, Wisconsin.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Washington.]\r\n\r\nLeaving now the question of general employment, where no general laws\r\nlimiting time or price would seem to be constitutional, except in\r\ncertain cases as to the employment of women and in all cases that of\r\nchildren, and going to special occupations, we shall find quite a\r\ndifferent principle; for in a special occupation known to be dangerous\r\nor unhealthy, certainly if dangerous or unhealthy to the general\r\npublic, it has always been the custom and has always been\r\nconstitutional with us to control conditions by statute. The question\r\nof what is a dangerous or unhealthy occupation to the public rather\r\nthan merely to the persons employed is, of course, a difficult one;\r\nand the Supreme Court of the United States have split so closely\r\non this point that they have in Utah decided that mining was an\r\noccupation dangerous to the public health, and in New York that\r\nthe baking of bread was not. That is to say, that the condition of\r\nbakeshops bore no relation to the general health of the community. One\r\nmight, perhaps, have expected that they would have decided each case\r\nthe other way; but we must take our decisions as we get them from the\r\nSupreme Court, reserving our dissent for the text-books. In any event,\r\nit can be seen that the line is very close, certainly in the case of\r\nadult male labor. The same statute as to mines existed in Colorado\r\nthat the United States Supreme Court sustained in Utah. The Colorado\r\nSupreme Court had declared it unconstitutional, and after the decision\r\nof the United States Supreme Court they continued to declare it\r\nunconstitutional, simply saying that the United States Supreme Court\r\nwas wrong. Anyhow, it is obvious that in trades which involve a great\r\nmass of the people, or affect the whole community, or particularly\r\nwhere there are definite dangers, such as noxious vapors or\r\ntuberculosis-breeding dust, it will be constitutional, as it is common\r\nsense, to limit the conditions and even the hours of labor of women\r\nor men, as well as children. Students interested in such matters will\r\nfind the universal legislation of the civilized world set forth in the\r\ninvaluable labor-laws collection of the government of Belgium; and he\r\nwill find that all countries of the world do regulate the hours of\r\nlabor as well as the conditions, in all such trades, and we should not\r\nremain alone in refusing to do so.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of regulating the hours of farm labor is, of course,\r\nobvious, and so far as I know, no attempt has yet been made. The same\r\nthing remains still true of domestic labor, though it has been more\r\nquestioned. It should be noted that both domestic labor and farm\r\nlabor belong to the class of what we call indefinite service. Now,\r\nindefinite service must always be regulated very carefully as to the\r\nlength of the contract, which is never to be indefinite; that is to\r\nsay, if it be both indefinite in the services rendered and in the time\r\nduring which they are to last, it is in no way distinguishable from\r\nslavery. For instance, in Indiana, many years before the Civil War,\r\nthere was an old negro woman who was induced to sign a contract to\r\nserve in a general way for life; that, of course, was held to be\r\nslavery. More recently the United States Supreme Court has held that a\r\ncontract imposed upon a sailor whereby he agreed to ship as a mariner\r\non the Pacific coast for a voyage to various other parts of the world\r\nand thence back was a contract so indefinite in length of time as to\r\nbe unenforceable under free principles, although a sailor's contract\r\nis one which in a peculiar way carries with it indefinite service. And\r\na contract \"_à tout faire_\" even for a week might be held void.\r\n\r\nIn all these matters the labor of women, and even that of children,\r\nwill very often control the hours of labor of men; for instance, in\r\nthe mills of New England, more than half the labor is not adult male;\r\nyet when any large class of the mill's operatives stop, the whole\r\nmill must stop; consequently, a law limiting the labor of women and\r\nchildren to fifty-six hours a week will be in practice enforced upon\r\nthe adult males employed in the same mill.\r\n\r\nContinental legislation has gone far beyond us in all these important\r\nparticulars. In most countries the conditions surrounding the labor of\r\nwomen, particularly married women, are carefully regulated by law.\r\nShe is not allowed to go back to the mill for a certain period after\r\nchildbirth, and in many more particular respects her health is\r\ncarefully looked after. Such legislation would possibly be impossible\r\nto enforce with our notions in America. The most interesting of all\r\nis perhaps the attempt made in the State of Connecticut within a few\r\nyears to improve social conditions by providing that no married woman\r\nshould be employed in factories at all. The bill was not, of course,\r\ncarried, but it raises a most interesting sociological question.\r\nRuskin probably would have been in favor of it. He described as the\r\nvery last act of modern barbarism for the woman to be made \"to shriek\r\nfor a hold of the mattock herself.\" It was argued in Connecticut that\r\nthe employment of married women injured the health of the children,\r\nwhich is perfectly true. Indeed, the death-rate in England is very\r\nlargely determined by the fact whether their mothers are employed in\r\nmills or not. It was also argued that her competition with man merely\r\nhalved his wages; that if no women were employed, the men would get\r\nmuch higher wages. On the other side it was argued that the effect of\r\nthe law would be largely immoral because it would simply prevent women\r\nfrom getting married. Knowing that after marriage they would get no\r\nemployment, they would simply dispense with the marriage ceremony; for\r\nit is obvious that under such legislation a man living with a woman\r\nunmarried could get double wages, which would be halved the moment he\r\nmade her his wife. This last was evidently the view which prevailed;\r\nand so far as I know, no such law has in the civilized world yet been\r\nenacted, though there is doubtless a much stronger social prejudice\r\nagainst women entering ordinary employments in some countries than in\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional question underlying all this discussion was perhaps\r\nbest set forth by an experiment of the late Mr. Edward Atkinson, which\r\nhe always threatened to bring into the courts, but I believe did not\r\ndo so. \"An Englishman's house is his castle\"; an English woman's house\r\nis her castle. Atkinson proposed that a woman of full age, living in\r\nher own house, should connect her loom or spindles by electric wire to\r\nthe nearest mill or factory, and then proceed to weave or spin _more_\r\nthan the legal limit of nine hours per day. Would the state, under the\r\nbroadest principles of English constitutional liberty, have the right\r\nto come in and tell her not to do so; particularly when the man in the\r\nnext house remained free? Up to this time there is no doubt that a\r\nfactory, a large congregation of labor, under peculiar conditions,\r\npresents a different question and a different constitutional aspect\r\nfrom that of the individual. This, indeed, is the principle which must\r\njustify the constitutional regulation of sweat-shops, as to which we\r\nwill speak next.\r\n\r\nThe sweat-shop is the modern phrase for a house, frequently a\r\ndwelling, tenement, or home, not a factory, and not under the\r\nownership or control of the person giving out the employment.\r\n\r\nNow a factory may obviously be regulated under ordinary police\r\nprinciples; but when the first great case came up as to regulating\r\nlabor in a man's own home, even though it was but one floor of a\r\ntenement, it was decided by the highest court of New York to be\r\nunconstitutional. The case was one concerning the manufacture of\r\ncigars, which by the statute was prohibited in tenement houses on any\r\nfloor partly occupied for residence purposes.[1] Nevertheless it may\r\nbe questioned whether, with the advancing social feeling in such\r\nmatters, legislation would not be now sustained when clearly aimed at\r\nsanitary purposes, even though it interfered with trades conducted in\r\na man's dwelling house. I hold that it is quite as possible for the\r\narm of the state to interfere to prevent the baking of bread in\r\nbedrooms, for instance, as it is to seize upon clothing which has been\r\nexposed to scarlet fever. A man's home, under modern theories, is\r\nno more sacred against this police power than is his body against\r\nvaccination; and the last has been decided by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In re Jacobs, 98 N.Y. 98. See the author's \"Handbook to\r\nthe Labor Law of the U.S.,\" p. 151.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Massachusetts _v._ Jacobson, 197 U.S. 11.]\r\n\r\nAt all events, legislation may be aimed against sweat-shops which in\r\nany sense resemble factories--that is, where numbers of persons not\r\nthe family of the occupier are engaged in industrial labor; so\r\nin Pennsylvania it has been extended to jurisdiction over shops\r\nmaintained in the back yards of tenements; while in most States the\r\nstatute applies to any dwelling where any person not a member of\r\nthe family is employed, and general legislation against sweat-shops\r\nalready exists in the twelve north-eastern industrial States from\r\nMassachusetts to Missouri and Wisconsin, leaving out only Rhode\r\nIsland.\r\n\r\nThe Massachusetts law as at present forbids work upon clothing\r\nexcept by members of the family in any tenement without license, and\r\nthereupon subjects the premises to the inspection of the police, and\r\nregisters of all help must be kept. Whoever offers for sale clothing\r\nmade in a tenement not licensed must affix a tag or label two inches\r\nlong bearing the words \"Tenement Made,\" with the name of the State and\r\ncity or town in which the garment was made. Moreover, any inspector\r\nmay report to the State board of health that ready-made clothing\r\nmanufactured under unhealthy conditions is being shipped into the\r\nState, which \"shall thereupon make such orders as the public safety\r\nmay require.\"[1] In New York the law applies to the manufacture\r\nof many articles besides clothing, such as artificial flowers,\r\ncigarettes, cigars, rubber, paper, confectionery, preserves, etc. A\r\nlicense may be denied to any tenement house if the records show that\r\nit is liable to any infectious or communicable disease or other\r\nunsanitary conditions. Articles not manufactured in tenements so\r\nlicensed may not be sold or exposed for sale, and there is the same\r\nlaw as in Massachusetts as to goods coming in from outside the State,\r\nand there is the same exemption of apartments occupied by members of\r\nthe family, and even then it appears that they are subject to the\r\nvisitation of the board of health and must have a permit. The\r\nPennsylvania law is similar to the New York law, and in addition, all\r\npersons are forbidden to bargain for sweat-shop labor, that is, labor\r\nin any kitchen, living-room, or bedroom in any tenement house except\r\nby the family actually resident therein, who must have a certificate\r\nfrom the board of health. The Wisconsin law apparently applies to\r\npersons doing the work in their own homes, who must have a license\r\nlike anybody else, and the owner of the building is liable for its\r\nunlawful use. The Illinois and Maryland laws are similar to the New\r\nYork law, while the Michigan statute resembles that of Wisconsin,\r\napparently applying to members of the family as well. The Missouri law\r\nforbids the manufacture of clothing, etc., in tenements by more than\r\nthree persons not immediate members of the family, while the New\r\nJersey and Connecticut statutes content themselves with making\r\nsuch manufacture by persons not members of the family subject to\r\ninspection.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Massachusetts R.L., 106, secs. 56 to 60 inclusive.]\r\n\r\nIt is a curious commentary that the very dream of the social reformers\r\nof only twenty years ago is so rudely dispelled by the march of\r\nevents; for in the late nineties it was the hope of the enthusiast,\r\nparticularly the student in electrical science, that the factory\r\nsystem might in time be done away with, and by the use of power served\r\nfrom long or short distance over wires to a man's own habitation,\r\nall the industries of manufacture might be carried on in a man's own\r\nhome--just as used to be the case with the spinners and weavers of\r\nolden time. Far from being a hope, it turns out that this breeds the\r\nvery worst conditions of all, and the most difficult to regulate by\r\nlaw. For modern homes for the most part are not sanitary dwellings in\r\nthe country, but single floors or parts of floors in huge tenement\r\nhouses in great cities. It is probable to-day, therefore, that there\r\nis a perfect reversal of opinion, and that the social reformer now\r\ndreams of a world where no work is permitted in the home, other than\r\nordinary domestic avocations, but all is compelled to be done in\r\nfactories under the supervision of public authorities--a splendid\r\nexample of the dangers of hasty legislation; for had we carried into\r\nlaw the eager desire of the reformers of only twenty years since, we\r\nshould, it appears, have been on a hopelessly wrong track.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted, however, that the reform of conditions is very\r\nlargely arrived at by a different path--that of the _building_ laws\r\nin our cities. No more arbitrary rule exists to-day or was ever in\r\nhistory than the despotic sway of a board or commission created under\r\nmodern police-power ideas. In everything else you have a right to a\r\nhearing, if not an appeal to the common-law courts and a jury; but the\r\npower of a building inspector is that of an Oriental despot. He can\r\norder you summarily to do a thing, or do it himself; or destroy or\r\ncondemn your property; and you have no redress, nor compensation, nor\r\neven a lawsuit to recover compensation. Therefore, if the sweat-shop\r\nreformers may not constitutionally regulate the conditions and\r\nbusiness of sweating so far as they would like to go, they can turn\r\nabout and directly regulate the actual building of residences where\r\nthe trade is carried on. They can require not only so many cubic feet\r\nof air per person in the sweat-shop, but so many cubic feet of air per\r\nperson in every bedroom; as Ruskin said, not only, of grouse, so many\r\nbrace to the acre, but of men and women--so many brace to the garret.\r\nA California law[1] once made it a criminal offence for any person to\r\nsleep with less than one thousand feet of air in his room for his own\r\nexclusive use! It is indeed a crime to be poor.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Ah Kow, Nunan, 5 Sawyer, 552.]\r\n\r\nThis legislation to reform sweat-shops is a field which has been\r\nalmost entirely cultivated by what I have termed the moral reformers,\r\nwith little or no help from organized labor. One's observation is that\r\norganized labor has been mainly concerned with the price of wages, the\r\nlength of hours, and with the closed shop; it has devoted very little\r\nof its energies to factory or trade _conditions_, except, indeed, that\r\nit has been very desirous of enforcing the union label, on which it\r\nasserts that union-made goods are always made under sanitary and moral\r\nconditions, and implies that the goods of \"scab\" manufacturers are not\r\nso.\r\n\r\nThe usual sweated trades in this country are the manufacture of\r\nclothing, underwear, tobacco, and artificial flowers. There has also\r\nbeen considerable regulation of laundries and bakeries, but not\r\nbecause they are what is commonly called sweated trades.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of factory legislation is too vast for more than mention in a\r\ngeneral way. It fills probably one-fourth in mass of the labor laws\r\nof the whole country, and applies in great and varying detail to the\r\ngeneral condition of factories, workshops, and in most States to large\r\nstores--department stores--using the word in the American sense.\r\nIt may be broadly analyzed as legislation for the construction\r\nof factories, for fresh air in factories, for general sanitary\r\nconditions, such as the removal of dust and noxious gases,\r\nwhite-washing, sanitary appliances, over-crowding, stair-cases,\r\nfire-escapes, and the prohibition of dangerous machinery. As has been\r\nsaid, it was begun in Massachusetts in the fifth decade of the last\r\ncentury, based originally almost entirely on the English factory acts,\r\nwhich were bitterly attacked by the _laissez-faire_ school of the\r\nearly nineteenth century, but soon vindicated themselves as legitimate\r\nlegislation in England, although not even there--still less in our\r\nStates--have we gone so far as the Continental countries.\r\n\r\nClosely connected with this may be mentioned that vast domain of\r\nlaw which is known as employers' liability. Under the old strict\r\ncommon-law rule, a servant or employee could never recover damages for\r\nany injury caused in whole or in part by his own negligence, by the\r\nnegligence of a fellow servant or even by defective machinery, unless\r\nhe was able to prove beyond peradventure that this existed known to\r\nthe employer and was the sole and direct cause of the accident. As is\r\nmatter of common knowledge, the tendency of all modern legislation,\r\nparticularly the English and our own, has been to chip one corner\r\nafter another off these principles. The fellow-servant rule has been\r\nvery generally abolished by statute, or in many States fellow servants\r\nhave been defined and divided into classes so that the master is not\r\nrelieved of liability when the injury to the servant is caused by\r\nthe negligence of a servant not in actual fact his fellow, _i.e._,\r\nemployed with him in his own particular work. In like manner the\r\nexemption for contributory negligence has been pared down and the\r\nliability for dangerous or defective appliances increased, practically\r\nto the point that the master becomes the insurer of his machinery in\r\nthis particular. The recent English statute goes to the length of\r\nputting the liability on the employer or on an employment fund in all\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nThe writer is strongly of opinion that this radical reform is, so far\r\nas constitutional, the end to be aimed at. The immense expense and\r\nwaste caused by present litigation, the complete uncertainty both\r\nas to liability and as to the amount of damages, the general fraud,\r\noppression, and deceit that the present system leads to, and finally\r\nits hideous waste and extravagance, are all reasons for doing away\r\nwith it entirely. He believes that for the employer's own benefit\r\nif there were a statute with a definite scale of damages, providing\r\ndefinitely, and as part of the employment contract if necessary,\r\nwith a certain small deduction from the wages, that there should be\r\ninsurance, that the master should be actually liable on a fixed scale\r\nfor all injuries suffered while in his employment not in disobedience\r\nto his orders or solely and grossly negligent, it would be far better\r\nboth for employer and employee. To-day it is possible that in many\r\ncases the employee gets no damages or is cheated out of them, or they\r\nare wasted in litigation expense (the Indiana Bar Association reported\r\nthis year that only about thirty per cent. of the damages actually\r\nrecovered of the employer reaches the party injured); while on the\r\nother hand the master can never know for how much he is going to be\r\nliable, and in the rare cases which get to a jury they are apt to find\r\nan excessive verdict. It is the custom with most gentlemen to pay a\r\nreasonable allowance to any servant injured while in their employ,\r\nunless directly disobedient of orders. There is no practical reason\r\nwhy this moral obligation should not be embodied in a statute and\r\nextended to everybody. The scale of damages should of course be put so\r\nlow as not to encourage persons to expose themselves, still less their\r\nown children, to injury in the hope of getting monetary compensation.\r\nBut although in India we are told the natives throw themselves under\r\nthe wheels of automobiles, it is not probable that in American\r\ncivilization there would be serious abuse of the law in this\r\nparticular. Five thousand dollars, for instance, for loss of life or\r\nlimb or eye, with a scale going down, as does the German law, to a\r\nmere compensation for time lost and medical attendance in ordinary\r\ninjuries, would be sufficient in equity and would surely not encourage\r\npersons voluntarily to maim themselves.\r\n\r\nThe next great line of legislation concerns the mode of payment of\r\nwages. The _amount_, as has been said, is never regulated; but it has\r\nbeen customary for nearly a century for the law to require payment\r\nin cash, or at least that it be not compulsorily made in goods or\r\nsupplies, or still worse in store orders. This line of legislation is\r\ncommonly known as the anti-truck laws and exists in most States, but\r\nhas been strenuously opposed in the South and Southwest as interfering\r\nwith the liberty of contract, so that in those more conservative\r\nStates the courts have very often nullified such legislation. It may\r\nbe summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) Weekly or time payment laws. These exist in more than half the\r\nStates, and are always constitutional as to corporations, but are\r\npossibly unconstitutional in all States except Massachusetts when\r\napplied to private employers.\r\n\r\n(2) Cash-payment laws, requiring payments to be made in actual money.\r\nThese statutes are commonly combined with those last mentioned and are\r\nsubject to the same constitutional objections. As a part of them,\r\nor in connection with them, we will put the ordinary anti-truck\r\nlaws--that is, legislation forbidding payment in produce or supplies\r\nor commodities of any kind. Finally, the store-order laws forbidding\r\npayment to be made in orders for indefinite supplies on any particular\r\nstore, still less on a store owned or operated by the company or\r\nemployer. Such laws have sometimes been held unconstitutional in all\r\nparticulars, sometimes when they apply only to certain industries,\r\nas, for instance, mines. In the writer's opinion they are never\r\nconstitutional when applied to corporations, nor are they class\r\nlegislation when applied to mines, for the reason that it is well\r\nknown that mines are situated in remote districts where there are few\r\nstores, and that the maintenance of a company store has not only led\r\nto much cheating but to an actual condition of peonage. That is to\r\nsay, the miners would be held in debt and led to believe that they\r\ncould not leave the mine or employment until the debt was liquidated.\r\nBelonging usually to the most ignorant class, it is matter of common\r\nknowledge that this has been done, and that Poles, negroes, or others\r\nof the more recent immigrants have been permanently kept in debt to\r\nthe company store or by advances or in other ways, as for rent or\r\nboard.\r\n\r\n(3) Closely allied to such legislation, of course, is the legislation\r\nagainst factory tenements or dwellings, but there is probably less\r\nreal abuse here, and therefore a greater constitutional objection\r\nagainst laws forbidding houses, especially model houses, to be built\r\nand rented by the employer. Such efforts, unfortunately, have not\r\nusually been popular. Far from helping labor conditions, they seem\r\nto have caused great resentment, as was notably the case in Pullman,\r\nIllinois, and very recently in Ludlow, Massachusetts. It may be that\r\nthe American temperament prefers its own house, and resents being\r\ncompelled to live in a house, however superior, designed for him and\r\nassigned to him by his employer.\r\n\r\n(4) The next matter which has evoked the attention of philanthropists\r\nand the angry resentment of the persons they supposed they were trying\r\nto benefit, is that of the benefit or company insurance or pension\r\nfunds. The principle of withholding, or contracting with the employees\r\nto withhold, a small proportion of their wages weekly or monthly to\r\ngo into an endowment or benefit fund, even when the company itself\r\ncontributes as much or more, was instituted with sanguine hopes some\r\nforty years ago, first in the great Calumet & Hecla Copper Company,\r\nand then in some of the larger railroads; and was on the point of\r\nmeeting general acceptance when it evoked the hostility of organized\r\nlabor, which secured legislation in Ohio and other States making it\r\na crime, or at least unlawful, for either side to make a contract\r\nwhereby any part of the wages was taken or withheld for such purposes.\r\nThe German theory of old-age pensions is based upon this principle;\r\nbut it is so unpopular in America that frequently in the South, when\r\nthings are done for the workmen, they are hardly permitted to know it;\r\na pretence, at least, is made that their own contributions are the\r\nentire support of the hospital, library, reading-room, or whatever it\r\nmay be, when, in fact, the lion's share is borne by the company. There\r\nis no doubt that the American laborer resents being done good\r\nto, except by himself; and is organized to resent any system of\r\nbeneficence to the point of making it actually prohibited by the law.\r\n\r\nMuch of the legislation described in this chapter is wise, and\r\nprobably all of it is wise in intention. Yet, in closing, one cannot\r\nresist calling attention to the unforeseen dangers that always attend\r\nlegislation running counter to the broad general basis of Anglo-Saxon\r\ncivilization. One need make no fetich of freedom of contract to\r\nbelieve that laws aimed against it may hit us in unexpected ways. For\r\none famous example, the cash weekly-payment law in Illinois existed in\r\n1893. In that year there was a great panic. Nobody could obtain any\r\nmoney; mills and shops were closing down, particularly in Chicago.\r\nEverybody was being thrown out of employment, and distress to the\r\npoint of starvation ensued. In the very worst days of that panic\r\nsome of the largest and most charitable employers of labor met their\r\nemployees in a monster mass meeting, and reported that while they\r\ncould not pay in full and nothing apparently was in prospect but an\r\nactual shutdown, they had succeeded in getting enough cash to keep all\r\ntheir employees, provided they would take weekly half what was owing\r\nto them in money, and the short-time notes or obligations of the\r\nfirms, or even of banks, for the remainder. The offer evoked the\r\ngreatest enthusiasm, was unanimously accepted by the thousands of\r\nemployees, and amid great rejoicing the meeting adjourned;--only to\r\nfind by the advice of their counsel next morning that under the laws\r\nof the State of Illinois such a settlement was made a crime, and that\r\nfor every workman who received his wages each week only half in cash,\r\nthe employer would be liable to a one-hundred-dollar fine, and thirty\r\ndays' imprisonment.\r\n\r\nThe great reform, not of legislation but of condition, in the labor\r\nquestion, is unquestionably to arrive at a status of _contract_.\r\nHitherto the principle that seems to have been accepted by organized\r\nlabor, at least in America, is that of being organized for purposes\r\nof offence, not for defence; like a mob or rabble which can attack\r\nunited, but retreats each for himself; which demands, but cannot give;\r\nwhich, like a naughty child or person _non compos_, is not responsible\r\nfor its own actions. Still there is, as yet, no legislation aimed at\r\nor permitting a definite contract in ordinary industrial employment;\r\nalthough there are a few laws which provide that when the employee may\r\nnot leave without notice, the employer may not discharge him without a\r\ncorresponding notice except for cause.\r\n\r\nAs relating mainly to strikes or concerted action, the question of\r\narbitration and conciliation laws will be left for the next chapter;\r\nbut we may close our discussion of individual legislation by calling\r\nattention to the striking attempt to revive mediaeval principles of\r\ncompulsory labor in certain avocations and in certain portions of\r\nthis country. The cardinal rule that the contract of labor may not\r\nbe compelled to be carried out, that an injunction will not issue to\r\nperform a labor contract, or even in ordinary cases against breaking\r\nit, is, of course, violated by any such legislation; but ingenious\r\nattempts have been made to get around it in the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThis world-wide problem is really rather a racial problem than an\r\neconomic one amongst Anglo-Saxons. The inability of the African and\r\nthe Caucasian to live side by side on an equality largely results from\r\nthis economic 'question' which, broadly stated, is that the Caucasian\r\nis willing to work beyond his immediate need voluntarily and without\r\nphysical compulsion; the African in his natural state is not. The\r\nAmerican Indian had the same prejudice against manual labor; but\r\nrather that, as a gentleman, he thought himself above it; and his\r\ncharacter was such that he always successfully resisted any attempts\r\nat enslavement or even compulsory service. The negro, on the other\r\nhand, is not above such work, but merely is lazy and needs the impulse\r\nof actual hunger or the orders of an overseer. We are, of course,\r\nspeaking of the mass of the people, in their natural state, before any\r\nenlightenment gained by contact with more civilized races. The whole\r\nquestion is discussed on its broadest lines by Mr. Meredith Townsend\r\nin his luminous work, \"Asia and Europe.\" He seems hopelessly to\r\nconclude that there is no possibility of white and black permanently\r\nliving together as part of one industrial civilization unless the\r\nlatter race is definitely under the orders of the former. Without\r\nassenting to this view it may be admitted that it is one which has\r\nvery largely prevailed in the Southern States, and the difficulty\r\nthere is, of course, with agricultural labor. So fast as the negro can\r\nbe made a peasant proprietor, the question seems to be in a measure\r\nsolved; but it is alleged to be almost impossible to get the necessary\r\nlabor from negroes when done for others, under contract or otherwise.\r\nThere is, therefore, a mass of recent legislation in the Southern\r\nStates which we may entitle the _peonage_ laws, which range from the\r\nhighly objectionable and unconstitutional statute compelling a person\r\nto carry out his contract of labor under penalty as for a misdemeanor,\r\nto the more ingenious statutes which get at the same result by the\r\nindirect means of declaring a person guilty of breaking a contract\r\nunder which he has acquired money or supplies punishable as for fraud.\r\nThere are also statutes applying and very greatly extending the old\r\ncommon-law doctrine of loss of service; making it highly criminal for\r\na neighbor to incite a servant or employee to break his contract or\r\neven to accept the work of a laborer without ascertaining that he\r\nhas not broken such contract, as, for instance, by a certificate of\r\ndischarge from his last master. These laws, it will be seen, differ in\r\nno particular from the early labor laws in England, which we carefully\r\nsummarized for this purpose; except, indeed, that they do stop short\r\nof the old English legislation which provided that when a laborer\r\nbroke his contract or refused to work he could be committed before the\r\nnearest magistrate and summarily punished. Even this result, however,\r\nhas been arrived at by the more circuitous and ingenious legislation\r\nof Southern States such as in Georgia, cited in the charge to the\r\nGrand Jury.[1] The principle of this elaborate machinery is always\r\nthat money advances, or supplies, or a lease of a farm for a season\r\nor more, or the loan of a mule, having first been made under written\r\ncontract to the negro, the breaking of such contract or the omission\r\nto repay such advances, is declared to be in the nature of fraud; the\r\nentering into such contract with intention to break it is declared to\r\nbe a misdemeanor, etc., etc. The negro refusing to carry out his labor\r\ncontract is then cited before the nearest magistrate, who imposes\r\nunder the statute a nominal fine. The negro, being of course unable to\r\npay this fine, is remanded to the custody of his bondsmen, who pay it\r\nfor him, one of them of course being the master. The negro leaves the\r\ncourt in custody of his employer and carries away the impression with\r\nhim that he has escaped jail only by being committed by the court to\r\nhis employer to do his employer's work, an impression possibly not too\r\nremote from the fact. It is easy to see how to the African mind the\r\nmagistrate may appear like an Oriental cadi, and how he may be led to\r\ncarry out his work as submissively as would the Oriental under similar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Jaremillo _v._ Parsons, 1 N.M. 190; _in re_ Lewis, 114\r\nFed. 963; Peonage cases, 123 Fed. 671; United States _v._ McClellan,\r\n127 Fed. 971; United States _v._ Eberhard, 127 Fed. 971; Peonage\r\ncases, 136 Fed. 707; charge to jury, 138 Fed. 686; Robertson _v._\r\nBaldwin, 165 U.S. 275; Clyatt _v._ United States, 197 U.S. 207; Vance\r\n_v._ State, 57 S.E. 889, Bailey _v._ Alabama, 211 U.S. 452; Torrey\r\n_v._ Alabama, 37 So. 332.]\r\n\r\nThere can be no question, except in the minds of those utterly\r\nunfamiliar with the tropics and Southern conditions generally, of the\r\ndifficulty of this labor problem throughout the world. It has appeared\r\nnot only in our Southern States but in the West Indies and South\r\nAfrica--in any country where colored labor is employed. The writer\r\nknows of at least one large plantation in the South where many hundred\r\nnegroes were employed to get in the cotton crops, and the employer\r\nwas careful never to deliver their letters until the season had\r\nterminated; for on the merest invitation to attend a ball or a wedding\r\nin some neighboring county, the bulk of the help would leave for\r\nthat purpose and might or might not return. Railway labor is not\r\nso difficult, because the workmen commonly work in gangs under an\r\noverseer who usually assumes, if he is not vested with, some physical\r\nauthority; but the case of the individual farmer who is trusted upon\r\nhis own exertions to till a field or get in the crop seems to be\r\nalmost impossible of regulation under a strict English common-law\r\nsystem. Farming on shares appears to be almost equally unsatisfactory.\r\nThe farmer gets his subsistence, but the share of the proprietor in\r\nthe crop produced is almost inappreciable.\r\n\r\nIn closing this chapter reference should be made to a large amount\r\nof American legislation, most of which was absolutely unnecessary as\r\nmerely embodying the common law. Still it has its use in extending the\r\ndefinition of the \"unlawful act.\" It will be remembered that one of\r\nthe three branches of conspiracy was the combination to effect a\r\nlawful end by unlawful acts. Now many of the States have statutes\r\ndeclaring even threats, or intimidation without physical violence, to\r\nbe such unlawful act. It may possibly be doubted whether it might not\r\nhave been so held at the common law; but such legislation has always\r\nthe advantage of getting a uniform line of decisions from all the\r\njudges. The New York statute passed many years ago may serve as a\r\nsample: It provides in substance that any threat or intimidation or\r\nabusive epithets or the hiding of tools or clothes, when done even by\r\none individual, is an unlawful act; therefore when strikers, although\r\nengaged in a lawful strike, as to raise their own wages, or any one\r\nof them, intend or do any such act, they become guilty of unlawful\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nThis is probably the only legislation on such matters which adds\r\nanything to the common law. Many of the States, usually Western\r\nStates--apt to be more forgetful of the common law than the older\r\nCommonwealths--have been at pains to pass statutes against blacklists.\r\nSuch statutes are entirely unnecessary, but as they relate to\r\ncombinations they will be considered in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nFrom the official report of the U.S. government, prepared by the\r\nCommission of Labor in 1907, it appears that twenty States and\r\nTerritories, including Porto Rico, have provisions against\r\nintimidation, of which the best example is the New York statute quoted\r\nabove. Alabama and Colorado have express statutes against picketing,\r\nother than the general statutes against interference with employment.\r\nNineteen other States, of which, however, only a few--Massachusetts,\r\nMichigan, Oregon, Texas, and Utah--are the same, have provisions\r\nagainst the coercion of employees in trading or industry, usually to\r\nprevent them from joining unions, but such statutes are also levelled\r\nagainst the compelling them to buy or trade in any shop, or to rent or\r\nboard at any house. Five States have statutes prohibiting the hiring\r\nof armed guards other than the regular police, and especially the\r\nimporting such from other States, Massachusetts and Illinois among the\r\nnumber, though none of the five are so radical as the later statute\r\nof Oklahoma quoted below. Statutes for the enforcement of the labor\r\ncontract exist usually only in the South, but we find a beginning of\r\nsimilar legislation in the North, both Michigan and Minnesota having\r\nstatutes making it a misdemeanor to enter into a labor contract\r\nwithout intent to perform it in cases where advances are made by way\r\nof transportation, supplies, or other benefits. The new anti-tip\r\nstatute or law forbidding commissions to any servant or employee is\r\nto be found in Michigan, Wisconsin, and other States (see page 155\r\nabove). A few States require any employer to give a discharged\r\nemployee a written statement of the reason for his discharge, but such\r\nstatutes are probably unconstitutional. Colorado has the extraordinary\r\nstatute forbidding employees to be discharged by reason of age.\r\nThe common law of loss of service is strengthened generally in the\r\nSouthern States by statutes against the enticing of employees. Public\r\nemployment offices, as well as State labor bureaus, are now maintained\r\nin nearly all the States.\r\n\r\nExaminations and licenses are now required in the several States\r\nof electricians, engineers, horse-shoers, mining foremen, elevator\r\noperators, plumbers, railroad employees, stationary firemen and\r\nengineers, and street railway employees, in addition to the trades\r\nenumerated on page 147.\r\n\r\nAll the Northeastern States except Maine and Vermont, and Maryland,\r\nDelaware, West Virginia, Alabama, Missouri, Tennessee, Wisconsin,\r\nMichigan, Illinois, Indiana, South Dakota, and Washington have general\r\nfactory acts, and all the mining States have elaborate statutes for\r\nthe safety of mines.\r\n\r\nNew York and Wisconsin have statutes forbidding or making illegal\r\nlabor unions which exclude their members from serving in the militia.\r\n\r\nConnecticut and Massachusetts have laws to facilitate profit-sharing\r\nby corporations. Such statutes would seem hardly necessary, as profits\r\nmay be shared or stock distributed or sold without a law to that\r\neffect; if it be regarded as part of the reward of wages, no\r\ninjunction would be granted to protesting stockholders. Fifteen States\r\nand Territories, including Porto Rico, have laws for the protection\r\nof employees as members of labor unions, and five as members of the\r\nnational guard or militia, similar to the New York statute just\r\nmentioned. Nearly all the States have laws for the protection of\r\nemployees as voters, as by requiring half holidays or reasonable time\r\nto vote, or that their pay should not be given them in envelopes upon\r\nwhich is printed any request to vote or other political material.\r\n\r\nNearly all the States require seats for female employees, and New\r\nJersey requires seats for horse-car drivers. Five States have general\r\nprovisions regulating the employment of women; ten forbid their\r\nemployment in bar-rooms (see page 226 above); three regulate their\r\nhours of labor to an inequality with men; and most of the States\r\nforbid females to be employed in mines or underground generally, or,\r\nas we have noted above, in night labor. California, Illinois,\r\nand Washington provide that sex shall be no disqualification for\r\nemployment. Four States, among them Illinois, require employers\r\nseeking labor by advertisement to mention (if such be the case) that\r\nthere is a strike in their establishment; twelve States (see\r\nabove, page 231) have so far tackled the sweat-shop problem, while\r\npractically every State in the Union makes wages a preferred claim in\r\ncases of death or insolvency of the employer.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one matter we have reserved for the last, because\r\nit is one of the two or three points about which the immediate contest\r\nbefore us is to rage. That is the case of individual discharge. It is\r\nelementary that just as an employee may leave with cause or without\r\ncause, so an employer may discharge without cause or with cause, nor\r\nis he bound to state his reasons, and certain statutes requiring him\r\nto do so with the object of avoiding a blacklist have been declared\r\nunconstitutional in Southern States. But organized labor is naturally\r\nvery desirous of resenting the discharge of anybody for no other\r\nreason than that of being a union man. In fact it is not too much to\r\nsay that this, with the legalization of the boycott, are the two great\r\ndemands the unions are now making upon society. Therefore, statutes\r\nhave been passed in many States making it unlawful for the employer to\r\nmake it a condition of employment that the employee should not be a\r\nmember of a union; or to discharge a person for the reason that he\r\nis a member of a union. And closely connected with this is the\r\ncombination of union employees to force an employer to discharge a man\r\nbecause he is not a member of a union. This last will come logically\r\nunder the next chapter covering combinations and is not yet the\r\nsubject of any statute. Now the difficulty of these statutes, about\r\nthe discharge of union labor, is that it is almost impossible to go\r\ninto the motive; a man is discharged \"for the good of the service.\"\r\nIt is easy, of course, to provide that there should be no written\r\nor definite contract on the matter; but it is not easy to punish or\r\nprohibit the discharge itself without such contract. Such legislation\r\nhas, however, been universally held unconstitutional, so that at\r\npresent this must be the final word on the subject. The right of the\r\nemployer to employ whom he likes and to discharge whom he likes and\r\nmake a preference, if he choose, either for union or non-union labor,\r\nis one which cannot be taken away from him by legislation, according\r\nto decisions of the Supreme Courts of Missouri, New York, and the\r\nUnited States. Therefore, as the matter at present stands, the\r\nconstitutions, State and Federal, must be amended if that cardinal\r\nright of trade and labor is to be interfered with.\r\n\r\nIn closing it may be wise to run over the actual labor laws passed in\r\nthe States during the last twenty years, mentioning the more important\r\nlines of legislation so as to show the general tendency.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 1890 we find most of the statutes concern the\r\ncounterfeiting of union labels, arbitration laws, hours of labor in\r\nState employments, weekly payment laws, the preference of debts for\r\nlabor in cases of insolvency, the prohibition of railroad relief\r\nfunds, the hours of women and children in factories, seats for women\r\nin shops, the restriction of prison labor, dangerous machinery\r\nin factories, protection in mines, and the incorporation of\r\ntrades-unions. Mechanics' lien laws are passed in large quantities\r\nevery year and are the subject of endless amendment. We will,\r\ntherefore, leave this out for the rest of our discussion as after all\r\naffecting only the owners of real estate.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 we find more laws regulating or limiting the hours of labor\r\nof women and children, prohibiting it entirely in mines; several\r\nanti-truck laws; two laws against the screening of coal before the\r\nminer is paid, and in Massachusetts, laws against imposing fines\r\nfor imperfect weaving and deducting the fine from the wages paid.\r\nPennsylvania thinks it necessary to enact by statute that a strike\r\nis lawful when the wages are insufficient or it is contrary to union\r\nrules to work, which latter part is clearly unconstitutional. There is\r\none statute against boycotting and three against blacklisting.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 there are more laws limiting the hours of labor of women and\r\nchildren to fifty-eight, or in New Jersey, fifty-five, hours a week;\r\nlaws against weavers' fines, and restricting the continuous hours of\r\nrailway men. The sweat-shop acts first appear in this year, and the\r\nstatutes forbidding the discharge of men for belonging to a union or\r\nmaking a condition of their employment that they do not belong to one.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the laws establishing State bureaus of labor become numerous.\r\nFour more States adopt sweat-shop laws, and there is further\r\nregulation of child labor. Six States adopt statutes against\r\nblacklisting.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, being the year after the panic, labor legislation is largely\r\narrested. New York adopts the statute, afterward held constitutional,\r\nrequiring that only citizens of the United States should be employed\r\non public works, and statutes begin to appear to provide for the\r\nunemployed. There is legislation also against intimidation by unions,\r\nagainst blacklisting, and against convict-made goods.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 there is still less legislation; only a statute for State\r\narbitration, against payment of wages in store orders, against\r\ndiscrimination against unions, and for factory legislation may be\r\nnoted.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 there are a few statutes for State arbitration and weekly\r\npayment, for regulating the doctrine of fellow servants, and some\r\nlegislation concerning factories and sweat-shops.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 California provides a minimum wage of two dollars on public\r\ncontracts, and Kansas adopts the first statute against what are termed\r\nindirect contempts; that is, requiring trial by jury for contempts not\r\ncommitted in the presence of the court. There is a little legislation\r\nagainst blacklisting, and Southern States forbid the farming out of\r\nconvict labor.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Virginia copies the Kansas statute against indirect contempts,\r\nand one or two States require convict-made goods manufactured outside\r\nthe State to be so labelled, which statutes have since been held\r\nunconstitutional as an interference with interstate commerce.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the question of discrimination against union labor becomes\r\nstill more prominent and it is in some States made a misdemeanor\r\nto make the belonging or not belonging to a union a condition of\r\nemployment. All these statutes have since been held unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, a year of great prosperity, there is almost no labor\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 we only find laws establishing free employment bureaus, except\r\nthat California provides a maximum time for women and children of nine\r\nhours a day in both manufacturing and mercantile occupations, and a\r\nminimum wage upon all public work of twenty cents an hour.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Colorado overrules her Supreme Court by getting by\r\nconstitutional amendment an eight-hour day in mines. Massachusetts\r\npasses a joint resolution of the Legislature asking for a Federal\r\nconstitutional amendment which shall permit Congress to fix uniform\r\nhours of labor throughout the United States, and Kentucky and other\r\nSouthern States begin to legislate to control the hours of labor of\r\nwomen and children.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 this movement continues and in the Northwestern States, Oregon\r\nand Colorado, the length of hours of labor of women of all ages is\r\ngenerally limited. Weekly payments and anti-truck laws are adopted.\r\nMontana forbids company boarding-houses and Colorado makes the\r\nstriking attempt to do away with the so-called dead line; that is to\r\nsay, a statute forbidding any person to be discharged by reason of\r\nage, between the years of eighteen and sixty. California follows\r\nMaryland in abolishing the conspiracy law, both as applied to\r\nemployers and employees.[1] It does not seem that in either State this\r\nstatute has yet been tested as class legislation. Legislation against\r\nthe open shop continues in far Western States, while Minnesota makes\r\nit a misdemeanor for an employer to exact as a condition of employment\r\nthat the employee shall not take part in a strike.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the next chapter.]\r\n\r\nIn 1904 there is little legislation. Far Western States go on with the\r\nprotection of child labor, particularly in mines, and Alabama adopts a\r\ngeneral statute against picketing, boycotting, and blacklisting.\r\n\r\nIn 1905 we first find legislation against peonage or compulsory labor\r\nin the Southern States, North Carolina and Alabama. The celebrated\r\nconstitutional amendment of New York is enacted, which gives the\r\nLegislature full power to regulate wages, hours, and conditions in\r\npublic labor. (See above, p. 161.) Further regulation of factories\r\nand mines goes on, with State employment agencies and reform of the\r\nemployers' liability laws. Colorado and Utah prohibit boycotts and\r\nblacklisting, and in one or two States corporations are required\r\nto give every person discharged a letter stating the reason of his\r\ndischarge, which statute was since held unconstitutional in Georgia.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 the usual sanitary legislation goes on. Massachusetts adopts\r\nan eight-hour law for public work. Arkansas and Louisiana attempt\r\nlegislation preventing the violation of contract by persons farming on\r\nshares, or the hiring of farm laborers by others, and Massachusetts\r\nestablishes free employment bureaus.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 four more Southern States attempt laws to control agricultural\r\nlabor; the factory acts and child-labor laws continue to spread\r\nthrough the South; New York largely develops its line of sweat-shop\r\nlegislation, and more child-labor laws and laws prohibiting the work\r\nof women in mines are introduced in the South.\r\n\r\nIn 1908 Oklahoma adopts the Kansas contempt statute, and Virginia\r\nprovides for appeals to the Supreme Court in contempt cases. South\r\nCarolina makes it a misdemeanor to fail to work after being employed\r\non a contract for personal services, or for the employer on his side\r\nto fail to carry it out. Oklahoma adopts a curious strike statute\r\nwhich, besides the usual provision for the closed shop, makes it a\r\nfelony to bring workmen, _i.e._, strike-breakers, from other places in\r\nthe State or from other States under false pretences, including, in\r\nthe latter, concealment of the existence of the strike; and makes it a\r\nfelony to hire armed men to guard such persons.\r\n\r\nWith this climax of labor legislation our review may properly end, but\r\nthe reader will not fail to note the advantage that may be derived\r\nfrom experience of these extraordinary statutes as they are tried out\r\nin the different States and Territories. It could be wished that some\r\nmachinery could be provided for obtaining information as to their\r\npractical working. The legislation of 1909 was principally concerned\r\nwith the matter of employers' liability for accidents, a conference\r\nupon this subject having been held by three State commissions, New\r\nYork, Minnesota, and Wisconsin. Massachusetts extended the act of 1908\r\npermitting employers and employees to contract for the compensation\r\nof accidents; and Montana established a State accident insurance for\r\ncoal-miners. California and Montana exempted labor in a large degree\r\nfrom the operation of the State anti-trust laws; but Washington\r\nadopted a new statute defining a conspiracy to exist when two or more\r\npersons interfere or threaten to interfere with the trade, tools, or\r\nproperty of another, and proof of an overt act is not necessary. North\r\nand South Carolina, Texas, and Connecticut passed the usual statute\r\nprotecting employees from being discharged because of membership in a\r\ntrades-union, which, as we have said, has been held unconstitutional\r\nwherever contested. Arizona, California, Idaho, Washington, Wyoming\r\nand Nevada enacted or amended eight-hour measures for employees in\r\nmines, but little was accomplished for children in the Southern\r\nStates.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See \"Progressive Tendencies in the Labor Legislation of\r\n1909,\" by Irene Osgood, in the _American Political Science Review_ for\r\nMay, 1910.]\r\n\r\nThe labor-injunction question has been recently covered by an\r\nadmirable study prepared by the Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics and\r\npublished in December, 1909. The investigation covers eleven years,\r\nfrom 1898 to 1908, in which there occurred two thousand and two\r\nstrikes. In sixty-six of these strikes the employers sought\r\ninjunctions and in forty-six cases injunctions were actually issued.\r\nIn only nine cases were there proceedings for contempt of these\r\ninjunctions, while only in two cases out of the two thousand were\r\nthere any convictions for contempt of court. In eighteen cases\r\ninjunctions were sought to prevent employees from striking, but\r\nonly in four of these were they granted, and one of these was later\r\ndissolved. Seven bills were brought by employees against unions for\r\ninterference with their employment, etc., and in three cases unions\r\nsought injunctions against other unions. In one case a union brought\r\na bill against an employer and in one case an employer sought an\r\ninjunction against an employers' association. Under a decision of the\r\nMassachusetts Supreme Court it was declared unlawful for a trade-union\r\nto impose fines upon those of its members who refused to obey its\r\norders to strike or engage in a boycott. In 1909 a bill was introduced\r\nin the Legislature with the special object of permitting this, but it\r\nfailed of passage. The _Bulletin_ contains a brief history of equity\r\njurisdiction in labor cases and reprints all the decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court of Massachusetts down to the year 1909, and the actual\r\ninjunctions issued by Superior Courts in five late cases, with a\r\nchronological summary of proceedings in cases concerning industrial\r\ndisputes in all Massachusetts courts for the eleven years covered by\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nThe matter of labor legislation is of such world-wide importance that\r\na word or two may not be out of place concerning recent legislation in\r\nother countries. Other than factory and sweat-shop acts and hours\r\nof labor laws, there are three great lines of modern legislation in\r\nEurope, North America, and Australasia: employers' liability, old-age\r\npensions, minimum wage. On the first point, the tendency of modern\r\nlegislation, as has been intimated, is to make the employer liable in\r\nall cases for personal injuries suffered in his employ without regard\r\nto contributory negligence or the cause of the accident. That is, it\r\nis in the nature of an insurance which the employer is made to carry\r\nas part of his business expenses. It has the great advantage of\r\ndoing away with litigation and confining his liability to reasonable\r\namounts, and in the writer's opinion is in the long run for the\r\nbenefit of the employer himself. There is one exception. The employer\r\nis not liable when the injury was caused by the wilful misconduct of\r\nthe workman injured.\r\n\r\nOld-age pensions, or State insurance against old age as well as\r\ndisability, now exist in several countries, notably Germany, New\r\nZealand, and England. The German law[1] is much the most intelligent\r\nand the least communistic in that it provides that half the fund is\r\nraised by deductions made from the wages of the workmen themselves.\r\nIt applies to all persons, male and female, employed under salary or\r\nwages as workmen, journeymen, apprentices, or servants; also to all\r\nindustrial workmen, skilled laborers, clerks, porters, and assistants;\r\nalso to all other persons whose occupation consists principally in\r\nthe service of others, such as teachers who do not receive an annual\r\nsalary of more than five hundred dollars; also to sailors and railway\r\nemployees; also to domestic servants. No one is obliged to insure\r\nhimself who is over the age of seventy, and no one is bound to insure\r\nwho does not work in a required insurance class for more than twelve\r\nweeks or fifty days in each year. When women get married, they insist\r\non reimbursement of one half of all the insurance assessments they\r\nhave paid up to that time, provided such assessments amount to two\r\nhundred weeks, or four years--a provision which must very much help\r\nout marriages, and from which the amusing deduction may be drawn that\r\nthe average value of a husband in Germany is considered to be about\r\none-half the expense of supporting his wife for a period of two\r\nhundred weeks, or four years. On the other hand, the law has the\r\neffect of postponing marriage for the first four years of a woman's\r\nemployment, as it practically imposes a penalty upon a woman marrying\r\nbefore four years from the time when she begins to pay to the State\r\ninsurance money.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: U.S. Industrial Commission Reports, vol. V, pp. 228-241.]\r\n\r\nThe English old-age pension law is a mere gratuity in the nature of\r\noutdoor relief, giving to everybody who has reached a certain age,\r\nwithout reference to any previous service, tramps or drones as well as\r\nworkmen. It is a law indefensible in principle and merely the accident\r\nof a radical government. It provides that every person over seventy\r\nwhose yearly means do not exceed thirty-one pounds ten shillings\r\n(_i.e._ income from property or privilege) and is not in \"regular\r\nreceipt of poor relief\" and has not \"habitually failed to work\r\naccording to his ability, opportunity and need\" nor been sentenced to\r\nany imprisonment for a criminal offence--all to be determined by\r\na local pension committee with appeal to the central pension\r\nauthority--shall receive a pension of five shillings a week when his\r\nannual means do not exceed twenty-one pounds, that is, thirteen pounds\r\na year, down to one shilling a week when they exceed twenty-eight\r\npounds seventeen shillings six pence.\r\n\r\nThe New Zealand law is more intelligent. It extends old-age pensions\r\nto every person over the age of sixty-five who has resided thirty-five\r\nyears in the colony and not been imprisoned for a criminal offence,\r\nnor has abandoned his wife, nor neglected to provide for his or her\r\nchildren. It does not, however, appear that any previous employment is\r\nnecessary. The pension amounts to eighteen pounds, say ninety dollars,\r\na year and is not given to any one who has an income of fifty-two\r\npounds a year. The machinery of the law is largely conducted through\r\nthe post-office and the entire expense is met by the state. That is to\r\nsay, there is no contribution from the laborers themselves.\r\n\r\nAustria, Italy, Norway, and Denmark in 1901 had also state insurance\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nThe minimum-wage idea has so far been attempted only In New Zealand\r\nand in Great Britain.[1] (See above, p. 160.) The New Zealand law of\r\n1899 provided a minimum wage of four shillings per week for boys and\r\ngirls, and five shillings for boys under eighteen, but the principle\r\nhas been much extended by a more recent statute. The English law\r\nis not yet in active operation, and may or may not receive great\r\nextension. It provides in substance for the fixing of a minimum wage\r\nin the clothing trade or _any other_ trade specified by the Home\r\nSecretary. The obvious probability is that it will, as in New Zealand,\r\nsoon be extended to all trades. This wage is to be fixed by a board of\r\narbitrators with the usual representation given to each side, and it\r\nwill doubtless work, as it does in New Zealand, for the elevation of\r\nwages, as such commissions rarely reduce them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This, the Trade Boards Act, the 22d chapter of the ninth\r\nof Edward VII., enacted October 20, 1909, took effect January 1, 1910.\r\nThe act applies without specification to ready-made and wholesale\r\ntailoring, the making of boxes, machine-made lace and chain-making,\r\nand may be applied to other trades by provisional order of the Board\r\nof Trade, when confirmed by Parliament. The Board of Trade may make\r\nsuch provisional order applying the act to any specified trade if\r\nthey are satisfied that the rate of wages prevailing in that trade is\r\nexceptionally low as compared with that in other employments, and\r\nthat the other circumstances of the trade are such as to render the\r\napplication of the act expedient; and in like manner they may make a\r\nprovisional order providing that the act shall cease to apply to any\r\ntrade to which it already was applied. Section 2 provides that the\r\nBoard of Trade shall establish one or more trade boards for any trade\r\nto which the act is to be applied, with separate trade boards\r\nfor Ireland. These trade boards (section 11) consist of members\r\nrepresenting employers and members representing workers in equal\r\nproportions, and of certain appointed members. Women are eligible,\r\nand the representative members may be elected or nominated as the\r\nregulations determine. The chairman and secretary are appointed by the\r\nBoard of Trade. Such boards are given power to fix minimum rates of\r\nwages both for time and piece work, which thereafter must be observed\r\nunder penalty. There is further a machinery for the establishment of\r\ndistrict trade committees. All regulations made by such Boards\r\nof Trade shall be laid as soon as possible before both houses of\r\nParliament; but there does not appear to be any other appeal.]\r\n\r\nCo-operation and profit-sharing, the great hope of the middle years\r\nof the nineteenth century, has made little progress in England or the\r\nUnited States since. Such successful experiments as now exist consist\r\nprincipally in offering to the employees the opportunity to buy the\r\nstock of the company at a reasonable rate, as in the case of the\r\nIllinois Central Railroad and the United States Steel Company. Many\r\nmills, however, give a certain increase in wages at the end of regular\r\nperiods proportionate to the profits. This technically is what we\r\ncall profit-sharing. The word \"co-operation\" should be reserved\r\nfor institutions actually co-operative; that is to say, where the\r\nemployees are partners in business with the employers. Of such there\r\nare very few in the United States, although there are quite a\r\nnumber in England. In 1901 there were only nineteen co-operative\r\nestablishments in the United States, most prominent among which are\r\nthe Peacedale Woolen Mills in Rhode Island; the Riverside Press in\r\nCambridge; Rand, McNally & Co., Chicago; the Century Company, of New\r\nYork; the Proctor & Gamble Soap Co., of Cincinnati; the Bourne Mills,\r\nof Fall River, and the Pillsbury Flour Mills, of Minneapolis. Yet\r\nthese institutions are really profit-sharing rather than co-operative,\r\nfor the return is merely an extra cash dividend to employees who have\r\nno voice in the management. Mr. Oilman in his book, \"A Dividend to\r\nLabor,\" tells us that there are thirty-nine other cases at least where\r\nprofit-sharing once adopted has been abandoned. On the other hand,\r\nin Great Britain there were in 1899 one hundred and ten important\r\nco-operative productive establishments. There are many more on the\r\nContinent.\r\n\r\nArbitration laws are also far more developed and successful in\r\nEuropean and Australasian countries than in Great Britain or the\r\nUnited States, although the first English act concerning arbitration\r\nwas passed as early as 1603. In the first year of Queen Anne, 1701,\r\nwas the first act referring specially to arbitration of labor, and the\r\nnext, Lord St. Leonard's act, in 1867, which attempted to establish\r\ncouncils of conciliation, something after the pattern of the French\r\n_conseils de prudhommes_; but in 1896 these acts were repealed and the\r\nConciliation Act of the 59th Victoria, chapter 30, substituted. It\r\nprovides that the boards of arbitration may act of their own motion in\r\nso far as to make inquiry and take such steps as they deem expedient\r\nto bring the parties together, and upon application of either side may\r\nappoint a conciliator, and on the application of both sides, appoint\r\nan arbitrator. Their award is filed of record and made public, but\r\nno provision is made for its compulsory enforcement. In France, the\r\nlegislation is much more intelligent. There the distinction between\r\nindividual and collective labor is clearly made and within recent\r\nyears there is elaborate legislation for the settlement of strikes,\r\ndisputes of the collective class, which we will later describe. For\r\nthe adjustment of individual disputes, France has long had in her\r\n_conseils de prudhommes_ a special system of labor courts that\r\nconstitutes one of her most distinctive social institutions.[1] These\r\nare special tribunals composed of employers and workingmen, created\r\nfor the purpose of adjusting disputes by conciliation if possible, or\r\njudicially if conciliation fails. Appeal from their decisions is made\r\nto the tribunals of commerce. The first such council was created in\r\nLyons in 1806, but since they have spread through all France. When the\r\namount involved does not exceed two hundred francs, the judgment of\r\nthe council is final; above that sum an appeal may be made to the\r\ntribunal of commerce. The most important element of all, perhaps, is\r\nthat these councils have to some extent criminal powers, or powers of\r\npunishment. They can examine the acts of workingmen in the industries\r\nunder their jurisdiction tending to disturb order or discipline, and\r\nimpose penalties of imprisonment not exceeding three days, having for\r\nthis concurrent jurisdiction with the justices of the peace. Elaborate\r\narbitration laws also exist in France, and whenever any strike occurs,\r\nif the parties do not invoke arbitration the justices of the peace\r\nmust intervene to conciliate. Still there is no compulsory arbitration\r\nexcept by agreement of both sides.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the author's Report to the U.S. Industrial\r\nCommission, vol. XVI, page 173.]\r\n\r\nSimilar laws exist in Belgium, Switzerland, Germany, Austria, Holland,\r\nNew Zealand, Australia, and Canada.\r\n\r\nThe apprentice system still exists in perfection in all European\r\nstates, including Great Britain, although there most of the unions\r\nrestrict the number that may be employed. In the United States it has,\r\nunfortunately, fallen entirely into disuse.\r\n\r\nIt has already been mentioned that the factory laws, laws regulating\r\nthe sanitary conditions, etc., of factories and sweat-shops, are far\r\nmore complicated and intelligent upon the Continent, and even in\r\nEngland, than in the United States of America.\r\n\r\nComing finally to what most persons consider the most important line,\r\nthat of strikes, boycotts, and intimidation, the legislation of the\r\nContinent of Europe where common-law principles of individual liberty\r\ndo not interfere, is, of course, far more complex and far more\r\neffective than that of either England or the United States. The\r\nprinciple of combination we leave for the next chapter. In European\r\nlegislation, where we are met with no constitutional difficulties,\r\nwe shall expect to find a more paternalistic control by the state,\r\nalthough in France the decree of March 2, 1791, provided that every\r\nperson \"shall be free to engage in such an enterprise or exercise,\r\nsuch profession, art or trade, as he may desire.\" In Germany an\r\nelaborate attempt has been recently made to re-introduce the old guild\r\nsystem made over from its mediaeval form to suit modern conditions,\r\nand in other countries where the government does not interfere, the\r\ntrade guilds, or unions, present insuperable obstacles to any one\r\nengaging in their industry who is not a member of the guild or has not\r\ngone through the required apprenticeship.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: U.S. Industrial Commission Reports, vol. XVI, p. 9.]\r\n\r\nThe French decree of 1791 freeing labor took effect also in French\r\nSwitzerland. A most interesting account of the experiment of the Swiss\r\nCantons on freedom of labor and the guild system will be found in\r\nthe U.S. Industrial Commission Report above referred to.[1] Germany\r\ndiffers from England and France in that the old guild system was never\r\nabsolutely done away with; in 1807 serfdom was abolished in Prussia,\r\nand a decree of December, 1808, apparently under the influence of\r\nNapoleon, proclaimed the right of citizens freely to engage in such\r\noccupations as they desired. Exclusive privileges and industrial\r\nmonopolies were abolished by subsequent decrees, and the general\r\nmovement for the freeing of industry was consummated in 1845 by the\r\nlabor code of that year, which, by the labor code of 1883, extends\r\nover all Germany: \"The practice of any trade is made free to all....\r\nThe distinctions between town and country in relation to the practice\r\nof any handicraft trade is abolished.... Trade and merchant guilds\r\nhave no right to exclude others from the practice of any trade.... The\r\nright to the independent exercise of a trade shall in no way depend\r\nupon the sex....\"[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1:_Ibid_., p. 10.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., pp. 11 and 12.]\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the more enlightened European countries arrived,\r\nunder the influence of Napoleon probably, or the French Revolution,\r\nin the early part of the last century, to the point of specifically\r\nadopting the English common law of liberty of labor and trade which\r\n\"organized labor\" seems already desirous of departing from; but the\r\nGerman Civil Code goes on to say (Section 611): \"By the contract of\r\nhiring of services the person who promises service is obliged to\r\nrender the promised service, and the other party is obliged to the\r\npayment of the salary or wage agreed upon. All nature of services may\r\nbe the subject of the service contract.\" It would seem, therefore,\r\nthat the contract may be specifically enforced. So, in France, by the\r\nlaw of 1890, \"A person can only bind himself to give his services for\r\na certain time or a special enterprise. The hiring of services made\r\nwithout a fixed duration can always cease at the wish of one of the\r\ncontracting parties. Nevertheless, the cancellation of the contract\r\nat the wish of one only of the contracting parties may give rise to\r\ndamages.\" It would appear, therefore, that definite contracts may be\r\nspecifically enforced, Austria has somewhat similar laws, although\r\na larger proportion of industrial employment is subject to state\r\nregulation, and here no employer can employ any workingman without\r\na book or passbook, which serves both as identification and record.\r\nGenerally in Europe the use of a written contract in labor engagements\r\nis far more usual than with us. This, perhaps, makes it easier to\r\nenforce such contracts specifically. Nevertheless, I find no specific\r\nstatute on the subject. Indeed, the Code Napoleon adopts the English\r\nlaw and provides[1] that \"every obligation to do or not to do resolves\r\nitself into damages in the case of non-performance,\" while the modern\r\nEnglish law act of 1875 provides a special and summary remedy in the\r\ncounty courts for labor disputes whereby when the contract is not\r\nrescinded the court may award damages or take security for the\r\nperformance of the labor contract itself. This, however, does not\r\ninclude domestic servants. Both France and Belgium copy the common\r\nlaw as to slavery, requiring contracts to be for a certain time or a\r\ndetermined work. In Russia, however, contracts may be made for five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., p. 64.]\r\n\r\nIt is still true that no European country outside of Turkey has yet\r\nfixed by law the amount of wages in private employments or the minimum\r\namount, though that result is effected by the machinery of arbitration\r\nin Great Britain and New Zealand. Continental countries, however,\r\nuniversally legislate as to hours of labor even of adult women, there\r\nbeing no constitutional principle protecting their personal liberty\r\nin that particular, although in Belgium and Great Britain the laws do\r\nnot, as a rule, apply to adult male labor. The hours are generally\r\neleven or twelve, instead of eight or nine as in England or the United\r\nStates. There is elaborate special regulation of times and conditions\r\nin labor in railways, laundries, bakeries, etc. The English law\r\ngenerally divides persons, according to their age, into three classes,\r\nadults, young persons (from fourteen to eighteen), or children, and\r\nthe system is most elaborate. Generally no children under the age of\r\neleven may be employed at all.\r\n\r\nSanitary and social regulations are far more intelligent than ours.\r\nGenerally, the employment of women in factories within four weeks\r\nafter childbirth is forbidden; and in Switzerland it is forbidden to\r\nemploy pregnant women in certain occupations dangerous to the health\r\nof posterity. The German Civil Code declares that \"A married woman has\r\nboth the right and the obligation of keeping house. She is obliged to\r\nattend to all domestic labor and the affairs of her husband in so\r\nfar as such labor or occupation is usual according to her social\r\ncondition. She is supreme within her sphere, or at least has power to\r\nact or bind her husband in domestic matters, and he cannot limit her\r\npowers without a divorce. He may, however, annul any contract made by\r\nher for her personal labor with a third party.\"[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., p. 53.] [Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 77.]\r\n\r\nThe anti-truck and weekly-payment laws exist in all countries.\r\nEurope generally, particularly Great Britain and the Roman Catholic\r\ncountries, are handicapped by an infinity of holidays. In Roman\r\nCatholic countries they are generally single days, saints' days, etc.,\r\nscattered throughout the year, but in Great Britain no skilled laborer\r\nwill work at all for some weeks at a time.\r\n\r\nThe English law against intimidation is the model of the New York\r\nstatute and most others. It defines in great detail what intimidation\r\nis--substantially, that it is violence or threats, the persistently\r\nfollowing, the hiding of tools, etc. or the watching or besetting the\r\nhouse or place of business--and menaces, as well as actual violence,\r\nare recognized as unlawful and punishable by imprisonment, in Germany,\r\nItaly, Sweden, and other countries. Germany and Austria copy the\r\nEnglish common law as to enticing from service.\r\n\r\nThere is as yet, however, no evidence in Europe outside of Great\r\nBritain of the American tendency to make a special privileged class of\r\nskilled or industrial labor. So far as appears, there is no special\r\nlegislation in any European country which is concerned particularly\r\nwith the legal or political rights of industrial laborers.[2] There is\r\nmuch more co-operation and sympathy between employers and employees,\r\nat least in Continental countries, and possibly for this reason\r\nco-operation has proved far more successful.[1] State labor bureaus,\r\nstate insurance, saving banks, and employment agencies are almost\r\nuniversal throughout the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Oilman's \"A Dividend to Labor,\" Boston, 1899. Jones's\r\n\"Cooperative Production,\" Oxford, 1894.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCOMBINATIONS IN LABOR MATTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have now gone over the history of modern legislation in the two\r\ngreat fields of property and personal liberty, and we have generally\r\nfound that the same principles of jurisprudence govern both. So shall\r\nwe now find when we come to combinations that there is no difference\r\nor distinction in the law between combinations of capital and\r\ncombinations of individual faculties. In both fields a \"combine\" is\r\nobnoxious, as the untutored mind instinctively feels. Combinations\r\nmay, of course, be lawful; but the fact that no actually criminal\r\npurpose or act can be found against them is not conclusive of their\r\nlegality. At the risk of wearying the reader I would reiterate my\r\nbelief that this was one of the greatest juristic achievements of the\r\nEnglish common law; and that the question whether it shall be all done\r\naway with or retained is the most momentous public question now before\r\nus in industrial and social matters.[1] Whether, on the one hand,\r\nStandard Oil combinations shall be permitted to the point of universal\r\nmonopoly of trade and opportunity; or, on the other, close unions\r\nbuilt up, even by legislation itself, to an equally impregnable\r\nposition of monopoly of opportunity, or so as to become a universal\r\nprivileged guild--are questions to be determined by the same\r\nprinciples; and equally momentous to the future of our republic and of\r\nhuman society as now constituted. And before passing to a review of\r\nthe legislation itself, I would lay down the principle which I believe\r\nto be the one which will ultimately be found to be the controlling\r\ntest: that of _intent_. The _effect_ (often proposed as the test) is\r\nreally immaterial as determining the illegality of the combination,\r\nexcept so far as it may be evidence of the probable intention of the\r\nparticipators at its inception.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Professor Dicey, I find, in his recent book, \"Law and\r\nOpinion in England,\" opens this subject with a statement equally\r\nstrong (Appendix, note 1, pp. 465-6).]\r\n\r\nFor the early English conspiracies were by no means necessarily or\r\nusually aimed at the commission of some definite crime; they were\r\nrather described to be the conspiracies of great lords for the general\r\n\"oppression\" of a weaker neighbor, for which he sought refuge or\r\nprotection in the court of chancery. Now, general oppression or\r\nwrongdoing, the exclusion from land or labor or property or trade,\r\nby a powerful combination, is precisely the moral injury suffered in\r\nmodern boycotts when there is no actual crime committed. Indeed, one\r\nof the earliest kinds of conspiracy expressly mentioned and described\r\nin the English statutes is a conspiracy for the maintenance of\r\nlawsuits, which by the very definition of the thing must be a\r\ncombination for an end not in itself unlawful. The American courts\r\nhave been curiously obscure or vacillating on this point. With their\r\ntoo general forgetfulness of historical legislation and the early\r\ncommon law, they have gone from one extreme to the other, often with\r\na trivial consideration of the importance of the points involved, and\r\nalways with an entire absence of a universal point of view, of that\r\ngenius which grasps a question in its entirety and is not confused by\r\nirrelevant details. It is only of late when the matter has come before\r\nthe Federal Supreme Court and the courts of a few States which have\r\nbeen educated by a frequent recurrence of disputes of this sort that\r\nwe begin again to see the principle clearly, as I shall venture to lay\r\nit down here: that the acts of a number of persons combined are to\r\nbe judged by their _intent_. In individual acts the intent is of no\r\nimportance except as it turns an accident into a crime; chance-medley\r\nfor instance into murder, or mere asportation into larceny, or\r\nordinary conversation into slander; yet these few instances serve to\r\nshow how universal is the recognition of intent in the law and how\r\nlittle difficulty it presents. Juries have very rarely any difficulty\r\nin determining this question of intent in individual acts; and in\r\nlike manner they will have no difficulty when it is recognized as the\r\nfundamental test in cases of combination, _i.e._, conspiracy. And for\r\nthe antiquity of this our law we need but mention a few cases: Rex _v.\r\n_ Crispe, cited in the Great Case of Monopolies (7 State Trials 513):\"\r\nHere was lately an agreement between copperas makers and copperas\r\nmerchants for the buying of _all_ copperas, and that these copperas\r\nmakers shall for three years make at so much a ton and restraining\r\nthem from selling to others\"--_held_ a criminal conspiracy; of the\r\ntailors of Ipswich (6 Coke 103) where a company of tailors made a\r\nby-law to exclude non-members from exercising their trade; and the\r\nLilleshall case (see p. 71 above).\r\n\r\nThus in matters of _capital_: is the _first_ intent, the _immediate_\r\nobject, to increase profits, to acquire or enjoy property, to enlarge\r\none's business,[1] or is the _first_ intention to destroy a competitor\r\nor create a monopoly? So in _labor_ combinations: is the _first_\r\nobject to get better terms for the persons combining, an increase of\r\nwages or a reduction of hours, improved conditions in factories and\r\nshops, etc., etc., or is the _first_ thing they are seeking to do to\r\ninjure a third person, not concerned in the dispute, or to control\r\nthe liberty and constitutional right of the employer himself? If the\r\nlatter, it is \"oppression\" within the meaning of the early common law,\r\nand should be so held to-day.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: What Mr. Cooke calls, in his preface, \"the natural\r\nincident or outgrowth of some lawful relation.\" _Combination,\r\nMonopolies and Labor Unions_, p. iv.]\r\n\r\nAnd not only is this great domain of English law noteworthy because it\r\nis so subtle as to grasp the effect of a combination other than that\r\nof the individual acts, and the intent of that combination other than\r\nits effect, but it is perhaps the only great realm of law which really\r\nattempts to carry out the principle of the Golden Rule. In all other\r\nmatters, if an act be lawful, it remains lawful, although done with\r\nthe intent of injuring another; it does not usually even give rise to\r\nan action for damages; but the great principle of the English law\r\nof conspiracy was crystallized two hundred years ago in the classic\r\nphrase of Hawkins, in his \"Pleas of the Crown,\" vol. II, p. 121:\r\n\"There is no doubt that a combination made to the prejudice of a third\r\nperson is highly criminal at the common law.\"[1] The usual definition\r\nof conspiracy, that is, of unlawful combination, is a combination made\r\nfor an unlawful purpose or for a lawful purpose using unlawful means;\r\nthis is to be found in all the text-books; but it should be amplified\r\nin accordance with our earliest and deepest law so as to include a\r\ncombination for the mere purpose of injuring another, or molesting him\r\nor controlling him in the exercise of his ordinary lawful rights; and\r\n_a fortiori_--as of combinations to enhance the price of food--to\r\ninjure the public. It is for this reason that the combination of\r\nmany to diminish the trade of one is an unlawful combination; the\r\ncombination may be punished although all the acts done are within the\r\nletter of the law; and when the conspiracy is evidenced by unlawful\r\nacts, the conspiracy may be punished far more severely than the acts\r\ncould have been punished themselves. We have noted that one of the\r\ngreat attempts of organized labor to-day is to do away with this\r\nprinciple, to provide that no combination should be punished when the\r\nacts committed are not punishable in themselves, and that in fact it\r\nshould be the acts and not the combination which is punishable at all.\r\nThis, it is true, was enacted by the English Conspiracy and Protection\r\nof Property Act of 1875, as to industrial disputes only, in England;\r\nand it is just as true that it would be unconstitutional in this\r\ncountry, both under the Federal and State constitutions. Yet the\r\nagitation for this revolution in the common law has been successful in\r\nMaryland, California, and Oklahoma, though, as has been said, it does\r\nnot appear that any cases have yet been tried where the exception was\r\npleaded in defence, still less where the statute has been sustained as\r\nconstitutional.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: \"The position cited by Chitty from Hawkins, by way\r\nof summing up the result of the cases, is this: 'In a word, all\r\nconfederacies wrongfully to prejudice another are misdemeanors at\r\ncommon law, whether the intention is to injure his property, his\r\nperson, or his character.' And Chitty adds that 'the object of\r\nconspiracy is not confined to an immediate wrong to individuals; it\r\nmay be to injure public trade, to affect public health, to violate\r\npublic police, to insult public justice, or to do any act in itself\r\nillegal (3 Chit. Crim. Law, 1139).\" Quoted by Shaw, Chief Justice of\r\nMassachusetts, in Commonwealth _v_. Hunt (4 Mete. Illinois), printed\r\nas a Senate Document in the 57th Congress, 1st session (Mass.) III.]\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the original English Act of 1875 only did away\r\nwith the criminal liability and left the victims of the boycott or\r\nblacklist free to sue the combination for damages; but by the \"Trade\r\nDisputes Act,\" 6 Edward 7, chapter 47 (December 21, 1906) the\r\nfollowing paragraph was added:\r\n\r\n\"An act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two or\r\nmore persons shall, if done in contemplation or furtherance of a trade\r\ndispute, not be actionable unless the act, if done without any such\r\nagreement or combination, would be actionable.\"\r\n\r\nAnd also a clause as to picketing:\r\n\r\n\"It shall be lawful for one _or more[1]_ persons, acting on their own\r\nbehalf or on behalf of a trade-union or of an individual employer or\r\nfirm in contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at\r\nor near a house or place where a person resides or works or carries on\r\nbusiness or happens to be, if they so attend merely for the purpose of\r\npeacefully obtaining or communicating information, or of peacefully\r\npersuading any person to work or to abstain from working.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The italics are our own.]\r\n\r\nAnd another upon inducing the breaking of contracts, loss of service:\r\n\r\n\"An act done by a person in contemplation or furtherance of a trade\r\ndispute shall not be actionable on the ground only that it induces\r\nsome other person to break a contract of employment or that it is an\r\ninterference with the trade, business, or employment of some other\r\nperson, or with the right of some other person to dispose of his\r\ncapital or his labor as he wills.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, after the Taff Vale case, trades-unions were exempted\r\nfrom all liability:\r\n\r\n\"(1) An action against a trade-union, whether of workmen or masters,\r\nor against any members or officials thereof on behalf of themselves\r\nand all other members of the trade-union in respect of any tortious\r\nact alleged to have been committed by or on behalf of the trade-union,\r\nshall not be entertained by any court.\r\n\r\n\"(2) Nothing in this section shall affect the liability of the\r\ntrustees of a trade-union to be sued in the events provided for by\r\nthe Trades-Union Act, 1871, section nine, except in respect of any\r\ntortious act committed by or on behalf of the union in contemplation\r\nor in furtherance of a trade dispute.\r\n\r\n\"(3) In this act and in the Conspiracy and Protection of Property\r\nAct, 1875, the expression 'trade dispute' means any dispute between\r\nemployers and workmen, or between workmen and workmen, which is\r\nconnected with the employment or non-employment, or the terms of the\r\nemployment, or with the conditions of labor, of any person, and the\r\nexpression 'workmen' means all persons employed in trade and industry,\r\nwhether or not in the employment of the employer with whom a trade\r\ndispute arises; and, in section three of the last-mentioned act, the\r\nwords 'between employers and workmen' shall be repealed.\"\r\n\r\nIt is hard to say whether any part of this surprising statute would be\r\nconstitutional in this country, except the second paragraph (p. 267,\r\nabove); leaving out even there the words \"or more.\" Certain it is that\r\nby it industrial conditions are placed under the sway of the labor\r\nunions, and the commerce and prosperity of England now lie in the\r\n\"hollow of the hand\" of those who work with it.\r\n\r\nThis effort to do away with the law of combinations in labor matters\r\nwith that aimed at forbidding or controlling the injunction in labor\r\ndisputes, and with also the statutes which give a special privilege to\r\nunion labor, we have found to be among the most important pieces of\r\nmodern legislation. Alabama and Colorado have statutes legalizing\r\n\"picketing,\" but a similar bill in Massachusetts failed repeatedly of\r\nenactment. But when we come to the statutes applying to _combinations_\r\nsolely, and defining them, there have been many statutes declaring\r\nblacklisting and boycotts to be unlawful--which is merely the common\r\nlaw--and a few statutes especially forbidding them. Thus, by the year\r\n1907, twenty-two States and the United States had statutes against\r\nblacklisting, five had statutes against boycotting, ten had adopted\r\nlaws regulating strikes in cases of railway employment, Minnesota a\r\nlaw forbidding any employer to require as a condition of employment\r\nany statement as to the participation of the applicant in a strike for\r\nmore than one year immediately preceding, Oklahoma a law requiring\r\nhim to advise new applicants for employment of any labor dispute then\r\npending with him, and to give such notice in his advertisements;\r\nwhich statute barely failed of enactment in Massachusetts. The best\r\ndefinition of the boycott is, perhaps, to be found in the law of\r\nAlabama: \"Any two or more persons who conspire together for the\r\npurpose of preventing any person, persons, firm, or corporation from\r\ncarrying on any lawful business, or for the purpose of interfering\r\nwith the same, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.\" The most cumbrous\r\nis that of Indiana, which, attempting to express the matter in more\r\ndetail, is far too long to quote.[1] Many acts which are really part\r\nof a boycott, or unlawful, _i.e._, sympathetic strikes, will be found\r\nunder the heading \"Intimidation\" or \"Interference with Employment\" in\r\nother States; such is the recent statute of Washington (see above, p.\r\n251). Unless the function of a statute be to instruct the ignorant, it\r\nwould probably be better to forego all such definitions and rely upon\r\nthe elasticity of the common law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: Indiana Revision of 1901, Sec. 3312 M. There is also an\r\nelaborate definition of \"trusts,\" \"conspiracies,\" and \"boycotts\" in\r\nchapter 94 of the Laws of Texas, 1903.]\r\n\r\nAs an example of the most advanced labor legislation we may briefly\r\ndigest the Oklahoma laws of 1907-8:\r\n\r\nBy the Act of May 29, 1908, two hours must be allowed by every\r\ncorporation or individual employer to his employees to vote, and it is\r\nmade a misdemeanor to in any way influence his vote; and there is a\r\ngeneral labor code enacted May 22, 1908, which, with its supplements,\r\nis perhaps the most radical labor legislation to be found in the\r\nUnited States. After establishing a State commissioner of labor, a\r\nboard of conciliation and arbitration, and free employment offices,\r\nall of which are usual in other States, there is an elaborate chapter\r\non factory regulation and one upon mine regulations, and to protect\r\npersons working on buildings, railroads, steam boilers, etc., and a\r\ncarefully drawn statute regulating the labor of children. Then there\r\nare other provisions which are more unusual. The Canadian statute\r\nsubstantially is enacted as to strikes: \"whenever there shall exist\r\na strike or lockout where (in the judgment of the State Board of\r\nConciliation) the general public shall appear likely to suffer injury\r\nor inconvenience, and neither party consents to an arbitration,\" then\r\nthe board, having failed to effect a conciliation, may proceed on\r\nits own motion to make investigation and propose a settlement, with\r\nrecommendations to both parties, and presumably publish the same.\r\nIt has, of course, no power to enforce a settlement, but may compel\r\ntestimony, etc. (Article II, section 4.)\r\n\r\nPrivate employment offices are carefully regulated, the fees limited\r\nto two dollars, and the money must be returned if no place is found,\r\nwith careful provisions against sending help to immoral resorts.\r\n\r\nThe compelling of an agreement, either written or \"verbal,\"[1] not\r\nto join, a labor union as a condition of obtaining or continuing in\r\nemployment is made a misdemeanor, punishable with one thousand dollars\r\nfine and twelve months imprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A common vulgarism; the law probably means \"oral.\"]\r\n\r\nSection 2 of this act (June 6, 1908) copies the _older_ English\r\nstatute of 1875; that is to say, it does away with all _criminal_\r\nliability for conspiracies in labor matters, and it further provides\r\nthat no \"such agreement, combination, or contract be construed as in\r\nrestraint of trade or commerce; nor shall any restraining order or\r\ninjunction be issued with relation thereto, provided only that nothing\r\nin this act shall be construed to authorize force or violence.\" We\r\nhave already commented on the possible unconstitutionality of this\r\nact.\r\n\r\nSection 3 makes it unlawful for anybody to induce or persuade workmen\r\nto change from one place to another (except presumably the labor\r\nunions themselves), or to bring workmen into the State by means of\r\nany false or deceptive representations, false advertising or false\r\npretences, or by reason of the existence of a strike or other\r\n\"trouble.\" Failure to state in an advertisement, proposal or contracts\r\nfor the employment of workmen that there is a strike or other\r\n\"trouble\" is made a criminal offence, punishable with a year's\r\nimprisonment or two thousand dollars fine (this is the law which\r\nfailed of passage in the Massachusetts Legislature of 1910).\r\n\r\nThe hiring of armed guards, as is usual in the West, is made heavily\r\ncriminal. Finally, to workmen who have been influenced or persuaded\r\nto do anything by anybody except another workman, is given a suit for\r\ndamages against the person so persuading them. The lot of the employer\r\nin Oklahoma is indeed a parlous one!\r\n\r\nBy the law of April 24, whenever a workman is discharged, his employer\r\nmust give him a letter stating the reason truly, under penalty of five\r\nhundred dollars fine and one year's imprisonment, and such letter must\r\nbe written, not printed, and the form and appearance of the stationery\r\nis carefully provided for and all secret marks forbidden. Oklahoma is\r\none of the eight-hour States, with the minimum average wage in public\r\nwork, referred to above; and all contracts must be made on that basis.\r\nWages must be paid fortnightly in cash, by all persons or corporations\r\nengaged in mining or manufacturing.\r\n\r\nOklahoma is the test-tube of American legislative reactions. We shall\r\nawait with interest the legislation of 1911, as well as the effect\r\nof the laws we have summarized above. In the meantime Oklahoma has\r\npresented to the constitutional lawyer the long-sought problem of\r\nwhether a sovereign State once admitted to the Union is bound by\r\nthe Act of Congress authorizing such admission. The enabling act of\r\nOklahoma required that its capital should be fixed at Guthrie and\r\nnot moved for a period of years. In May, 1910, within such period of\r\nlimitation, by act of legislature, supplemented by a plebiscitum of\r\nthe people and the executive action of Governor Haskell, the capital\r\nwas removed to Oklahoma City, and the State seal conveyed there\r\nsurreptitiously, in spite of the injunction of a Federal district\r\ncourt. A more beautiful American constitutional question could hardly\r\nbe presented. It may not at first seem to the reader so important, but\r\nwhen he considers that, for instance, Utah and other Western States\r\nhave abolished Mormonism in the same manner, or have agreed to give\r\nequal treatment to the Japanese and Chinese in the same manner--by\r\nan enabling act of Congress, ratified and perpetuated in the State\r\nConstitution--he will see the importance of the question. It was\r\nanticipated in the writer's work on constitutional law (\"Federal and\r\nState Constitutions,\" p. 186, note 8): \"The enabling acts admitting\r\nthe eight new Western States usually provided against polygamy on\r\naccount of the Mormon influence, and this, with other provisions\r\nconcerning schools, etc., was made forever irrepealable without the\r\nconsent of the United States; see Utah 3, 1. This is probably only a\r\nmoral obligation; a State when once admitted comes in with all the\r\nrights of the older States. So far as this section is concerned, Utah\r\ncould probably amend her Constitution and re-establish Mormonism\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nEuropean legislation is necessarily more elaborate because there is\r\nusually no body of existing common law. Trades-unions are universally\r\nmade lawful, as they are with us. But in France in certain cases the\r\nconsent of the government to the formation of such organizations is\r\nnecessary; and the Code Napoleon made unlawful all combinations of\r\npersons with an \"evil end.\"[1] So, \"full freedom of association\" is\r\nnow guaranteed in Switzerland; and in Germany the trade guilds are\r\nlargely recognized, but membership must not be compulsory. In Austria\r\na strict governmental control is exercised, and the principle of\r\nobligatory guilds is unreservedly accepted. There does not appear to\r\nbe any legislation upon strikes except in Great Britain, France, and\r\nItaly, such matters being left largely to the political or police\r\nauthorities. Strikes were unlawful in England until comparatively\r\nrecent times, but were always lawful in this country, and are so by\r\nthe modern French law, which is much similar to ours, as is the case\r\nin Italy; but in Russia the leaders of a strike may be imprisoned.\r\n\r\n[1] Quoted in Dane's Abridgment, published in 1800.\r\n\r\nIn no country do I find any specific legislation as to boycotts,\r\nexcept the English statute already referred to, repealing the common\r\nlaw of conspiracy, both civil and criminal, in industrial disputes.\r\nGermany and Austria have blacklisting laws. The matter of riots, etc.,\r\nis generally left to the criminal law to control. In no country other\r\nthan the United States do I find any prohibition against a man's\r\nprotecting his own property with private guards, armed or otherwise.\r\n\r\nArbitration laws in the British colonies are very generally aimed\r\nat the prevention of strikes. Otherwise there seems to be less\r\nlegislation on the subject during the last ten years than might have\r\nbeen expected. The Orange River Colony has severe laws concerning the\r\nlabor of the blacks, of a nature resembling our peonage laws in\r\nthe Southern States. Similar conditions seem to lead to similar\r\nlegislation throughout the modern world.\r\n\r\nLegislation is now much desired here also to obviate the effect of\r\nthe Taff Vale case and that of the Danbury hatters which applies its\r\nprincipals to interstate commerce; that is to say, which shall secure\r\nthe funds of a trades-union to its benevolent purposes, or even to its\r\nuse in industrial disputes, strikes, boycotts, etc., without making it\r\nliable for the results of litigation. In these cases the moneys in the\r\ntreasury of a trades-union, although unincorporated, have been held\r\nresponsible for damages awarded in a suit brought against the union or\r\nits members for conspiracy under the Sherman Act, or otherwise. It\r\nis, however, difficult to see how such legislation with us could be\r\ndevised so as to be constitutional, for it would necessarily extend\r\nonly to a certain class of persons, and be framed to exempt them\r\nalone from a certain definite legal liability. Nevertheless it has in\r\nEngland been enacted.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See above, p. 268: The Trade Disputes Act, 1906, sec. 4.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMILITARY AND MOB LAW, AND THE RIGHT TO ARMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to a field of legislation related to the early English\r\nconstitutional right to be protected from military law or molestation\r\nby the army, and the corresponding right of protection of one's\r\nperson, or one's house, by force, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe right of law, even as against the military, has been anticipated\r\nin an early chapter; the right to try an officer, or even a soldier\r\nobeying orders, in the ordinary tribunals, for homicide, or for\r\nordinary trespass, as when, in the Dorr rebellion in Rhode Island,\r\na company of militia invaded a woman's house.[1] The constitutional\r\nprinciple against the quartering of soldiers upon private dwellings,\r\nand the limitations to the military power caused by the strict\r\nconfinement of the use of the army to cases of invasion or\r\ninsurrection, have been added by American constitutions. But most\r\nimportant of all is the supremacy of the common law; the grudging\r\npermission of military law even to the army themselves only by\r\na temporary vote; for in England, the Mutiny Act must be passed\r\nannually, and in the United States, appropriations for the army and\r\nnavy may not last over two years. It is these statutes alone that\r\nmake possible the very government of the army, the enforcement of the\r\ncontract of enlistment, and the condign punishment of deserters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Martin _v_. Mott, 12 Wheaton, 19.]\r\n\r\nFor example, let us remember the Boston Massacre. Ten years before the\r\nRevolution, some turbulent men, mostly negroes, started a riot against\r\nBritish soldiers on what is now State Street (then King Street), and\r\nunder the orders of the commanding officer the soldiers fired, and two\r\nor three men were killed. Yet although the colonies were already under\r\nmilitary occupation, and their courts and legislatures more than\r\nunpopular with the home government, these British soldiers were tried\r\nfor manslaughter and murder, not in England, but in the ordinary\r\ncommon-law courts of the Colony of Massachusetts. James Otis defended\r\nthem and they were acquitted. The fact that a monument to Crispus\r\nAttocks, the negro, now stands on Boston Common, and that ten or\r\ntwelve years later the British flag was expelled from Boston to seek\r\nrefuge in New York, does not modify the significance of the incident.\r\nSome years since in a Pennsylvania strike a small company of militia,\r\nbeing attacked by a mob, were ordered to fire. They did so, and killed\r\none of the striking rioters. It was found out which private had fired\r\nthe fatal shot; he was indicted and tried for murder; and it was ruled\r\nthat the order of the commanding officer was no defence.\r\n\r\nThese principles, we should be reminded, are fundamental; in our own\r\ncountry in time of peace, or even in time of war, except in hostile\r\nterritory, there is no such thing as martial law; and no such thing\r\nas military law, except for the army itself, and then only by the\r\nsufferance of a biennial vote, which vote also limits the duration\r\nof existence of the regular army; besides which, all our State\r\nconstitutions and the Declaration of Independence have a general\r\nprovision against standing armies. The proclamations of military\r\nofficers, of mayors of cities, or even State governors, declaring\r\nmartial law, or suspending the writ of habeas corpus, are of no legal\r\nvalidity; this is true of a similar proclamation by the President of\r\nthe United States, though it was frequently done by Abraham Lincoln.\r\nThe act of Mayor Ruef of San Francisco, even at the time of the\r\nearthquake, declaring martial law, or giving troops or vigilance\r\ncommittees summary powers of punishment, was a mere \"bluff.\" Such an\r\norder, though in practice obeyed by all good citizens, would in no\r\nway protect those acting under it from prosecution in the criminal or\r\ncivil courts.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the right to bear arms is inherent under English\r\nideas, and this alone, with the corresponding right of political\r\nassembly, has served largely to maintain English liberty; while the\r\nabsence of these two important rights has relieved countries like\r\nRussia from all fear of revolution. One has only to read Mr. George\r\nTrevelyan's vivid account of the difficulties of the Garibaldi\r\nmovement to free Italy in 1860, to realize the enormous difficulties\r\nunder which the great patriot labored from the absence of these\r\nunderlying principles. Indeed, but for the connivance of the\r\nPiedmontese government in allowing somebody to sell a thousand\r\ncondemned rifles, it is probable that there would have been no\r\nrevolution in Sicily.\r\n\r\nNow this Anglo-Saxon right to arms goes back to times before the very\r\ndawn of the English Constitution, and the fyrd or local militia was\r\nin Saxon times, as it was declared to be by our American State\r\nconstitutions of the eighteenth century, \"the natural and only defence\r\nof a free country.\" This principle was very soon re-established after\r\nthe Conquest. We find, as early as 1181, the Assize of Arms, which\r\nrevives the ancient fyrd or militia. Twenty-two years before scutage\r\nhad been substituted for military service; but this was merely a\r\nmatter of feudal tenure. Yet so early was a direct call for troops\r\nforbidden to the crown. The contest of English ideals against Norman\r\nideas was one of the principal causes of Magna Charta itself (it is\r\nsignificant that the Great Charter was never published in French);\r\nthe barons were required to support the king in war, but complained\r\nagainst being led out of the kingdom; and King John's insistence\r\nupon this led to the assembly at Runnymede. Thus the militia and the\r\nmaintenance of arms other than of feudal retainers--and this exception\r\nled to the statutes against maintainors--passed out of the executive\r\npower and became the province of the legislative branch; a principle\r\ncarried out in all our constitutions; they make the executive the\r\ncommander-in-chief of the army, navy, or militia, but the governor may\r\nusually not command in the field, nor order troops out of a State; and\r\nthe president cannot employ Federal troops _in_ a State, except when\r\nrequested by its legislature; save only where necessary to maintain\r\nthe functions of the Federal government itself, or when a State\r\ngovernment ceases to be republican in form--but of that last who is to\r\nbe the judge?\r\n\r\nWith the doing away of direct military service, never yet to be\r\nre-established in England, though the threat of conscription is now\r\nmade, disappeared the power of the king to control his people;\r\nand this prevented the establishment of a royal autocracy and the\r\nextinction of representative government which took place in every\r\nContinental State. It is a picturesque fact that mercenary soldiers\r\nwere first employed in England in small numbers to suppress Jack Cade\r\nin 1449, who was leading a labor insurrection; just as the first\r\ninstance where Federal troops were employed in intra-State matters in\r\nAmerica was when President Cleveland sent them to suppress rioters\r\ninterfering with the movement of mails in the Pullman strike in\r\nChicago.\r\n\r\nWith standing armies abolished, and the fear of invasion removed, the\r\npractice of keeping arms fell into disuse, so that curiously enough we\r\nfind under the Stuarts statutes compelling citizens to keep and bear\r\narms, just as we find statutes compelling them to take their seats\r\nin Parliament. For quite three centuries we find no legislation\r\nconcerning arms, and Hallam mentions that by 1485 six liberty rights\r\nwere established, among them that \"officers, administrators or\r\nsoldiers are liable for their acts at the common law.\" It is not until\r\n1679 under Charles II, the very year of the Habeas Corpus Act, that\r\nstanding armies are definitely established in England, and the Mutiny\r\nAct concerning the government of the army was first passed. The\r\nstruggle of the people with the army under Charles I may be well shown\r\nby these quotations from the Petition of Right in 1628:\r\n\r\n\" ... of late great companies of soldiers and mariners have been\r\ndispersed into divers counties of the realm, and the inhabitants\r\nagainst their wills have been compelled to receive them into their\r\nhouses and there to suffer them to sojourn, against the laws and\r\ncustoms of this realm ...\"\r\n\r\n\" ... certain persons have been appointed commissioners, with power\r\nand authority to proceed ... according to ... martial law ... and by\r\nsuch summary course and order as is agreeable to martial law, and\r\nas is used in armies in time of war, to proceed to the trial and\r\ncondemnation of such offenders, and them to cause to be executed and\r\nput to death according to the law martial. By pretext whereof some of\r\nyour Majesty's subjects have been by some of the said commissioners\r\nput to death, when and where, if by the laws and statutes of the land\r\nthey had deserved death, by the same laws and statutes also they might\r\nand by no other ought, to have been judged and executed.\"\r\n\r\nAnd by the Bill of Rights of 1689:\r\n\r\n\"That the subjects which are Protestants may have arms for their\r\ndefence suitable to their conditions, and as allowed by law.\"\r\n\r\n\"That the raising or keeping a standing army, within the kingdom in\r\ntime of peace, unless it be with consent of Parliament, is against\r\nlaw.\"\r\n\r\nNow it often happens that a great constitutional principle established\r\nwith some difficulty in England is amplified and perfected by the\r\nbolder statement in American constitutions. Thus, the Virginia Bill of\r\nRights, 1776, has the perfect definition:\r\n\r\n\"That a well-regulated militia, composed of the body of the people,\r\ntrained to arms, is the proper, natural, and safe defence of a free\r\nState; that standing armies in time of peace should be avoided as\r\ndangerous to liberty; and that in all cases the military should be\r\nunder strict subordination to, and governed by, the civil power.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar declarations are found in the Declaration of Independence the\r\nsame year, and the Massachusetts Bill of Rights four years later; but\r\nthe Virginia definition, being the work of Thomas Jefferson, is both\r\nthe most compendious and the most concise, and is substantially copied\r\nin the Second and Third Amendments of the Federal Constitution. Modern\r\nlegislation on the subject has found little to improve, although, with\r\nthe ignorance of constitutional history too often found in modern\r\nstatutes, we do find State laws which recognize martial law as a\r\nreally existent domain of English and American jurisprudence. As our\r\ngreatest jurists have often enough declared: \"martial law\" is nothing\r\nbut the will of the commanding officer, the negation of all law, which\r\nexists when the courts do not sit and the writ of habeas corpus does\r\nnot run. Even in these imperial days, I detect no tendency in the\r\nlegislation of the States, or even of the Federal government in North\r\nAmerica, to infringe upon these great principles of freedom. On the\r\ncontrary, many State constitutions, as well as an act of Congress,\r\ndeclare that the writ of habeas corpus can never be suspended by\r\nthe executive, but only by the people's representatives in the\r\nlegislature. The prejudice against standing armies does not seem to be\r\nas strong, in that ours has recently been quadrupled in size; but this\r\nis probably no more than proportionate to our national expansion. Many\r\nof the States in this time of increasing civic disorder have had to\r\ngive their attention to the suppression of mobs, and correspondingly\r\nwe very generally find new complete codes governing the militia. Thus\r\nstatutes are frequent exempting a private soldier from prosecution for\r\nmurder when he fires under the orders of his commanding officer; and\r\nthe honest judgment of the commanding officer is made a defence\r\nfor all acts of his troops in attacking mobs, even to the point of\r\nfatalities resulting. Counties or cities are very generally made\r\nliable for damage to property done by mobs, and in some States for\r\ndamage to life done by lynchers; the widow and children of the person\r\nlynched may recover damages. In Kansas, by a statute of 1900, it is\r\nmade a misdemeanor for a bystander to refuse to assist a sheriff\r\nin quelling a riotous disorder. Most significant, perhaps, of this\r\nmilitia legislation is that concerning its relation to the labor\r\nunions, and more significant still, the too apparent desire of labor\r\nunions to prevent their members from serving in the militia. Thus,\r\nNew York and other States have already found it necessary to enact\r\nstatutes prohibiting any discrimination against persons because they\r\nserve in the militia; prohibiting their employers from discharging\r\nthem by reason of their necessary absence on such service, and\r\nforbidding the labor unions from in any way preventing them, or\r\npassing by-laws against their serving in the militia. Such by-laws\r\nare, however, unlawful under the common law.\r\n\r\nThe law-making most in the popular mind on this whole question is that\r\nconcerning pensions. As is well known, the Federal pension list has\r\nswollen to a sum far in excess of the total expense of the standing\r\narmy of Germany. An enormous number of Spanish War veterans who never\r\neven left the country are being added to the list, and their widows\r\nwill be after them; the last survivor of such may not die before A.D.\r\n2140, and the States themselves have not lagged far behind, all to the\r\nenormous corruption of our citizenship; indeed, one or two more wars\r\n(which the very motive of such wholesale pensioning is the more likely\r\nto bring on) would bankrupt the nation more rapidly than even our\r\nbattleships. Not only that, but there is a distinct tendency to make a\r\nprivileged class of veterans, and the sons of veterans--and perhaps we\r\nshall find of the sons of sons of veterans--by giving them preference\r\nin civic employment and special education, support, or privileges at\r\nthe State's expense. Sometimes they get pedlar's licenses for nothing;\r\nsometimes they are to be preferred in all civic employment; sometimes\r\nthey have special schools or asylums as well as soldiers' homes;\r\nsometimes they are given free text-books in the public schools. The\r\nConfederate States have not been behindhand in enacting similar\r\nlaws for their own soldiers, despite the implied prohibition of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment; but Southern courts have held them void.\r\n\r\nThe general right to bear arms is frequently restricted by the\r\nprohibition of concealed weapons, or of the organization, drilling,\r\nand training of armed companies not under State or Federal control,\r\nboth of which limitations have been held constitutional; and the\r\nlegislation prohibiting the employment or importation of private armed\r\nguards, such as the Pinkerton men, has been already alluded to in our\r\nchapter on labor legislation. The precedent for the latter is to be\r\nfound in the early English legislation against retainers; that is to\r\nsay, the armed private guard, or \"livery,\" of the great noblemen;\r\nwhence is derived the custom of putting servants in livery. The\r\nlegislation against private drill companies is closely allied, and had\r\na somewhat amusing test in Chicago where, during a labor strike, a\r\nnumber of the strike sympathizers organized a so-called drill company\r\nand furnished themselves with guns, for the purpose really of\r\nintimidating the public and helping the law-breakers. Unfortunately it\r\nso happened, for this purpose, that the first time they sallied forth\r\nwith sword and musket on warfare bent, they were stopped by one or two\r\npolicemen on the nearest street corner, taken to the station-house,\r\ndeprived of their arms, and locked up for the night. The next morning\r\na fine was imposed upon their captain, who appealed to the United\r\nStates Supreme Court without success.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Presser _v_. Illinois, 116 U.S. 252.]\r\n\r\nThe legislation for giving damages for injuries to property done by\r\nmobs was tested after the Pittsburg riots of 1873, and that yellow\r\nmetropolis was mulcted in heavy damages, which it took twenty-three\r\nyears to pay off. But no damages in this country were ever given for\r\ncriminal homicide directly, although there is an interesting case in\r\nthe Federal Circuit Court of a gentleman in Georgia who was awaited by\r\na party of neighboring gentlemen with the intention of shooting him\r\nup when he arrived. One of his friends secretly got to the railway\r\nstation and sent a telegram to his wife, shortly to become his widow,\r\nnot to come. The Western Union Telegraph Company delayed the message,\r\nits operator being in sympathy with the gentlemen of the neighboring\r\ntown, and the widow failed to recover damages from the telegraph\r\ncompany. But these modern statutes in Ohio and the Southern States,\r\nmaking towns responsible in a definite sum to the kin of a murdered\r\nman, are the exact re-enactment of the early Anglo-Saxon law; except\r\nthat the blood damages--the were gild--were in those days put upon the\r\nneighbors or the kin of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Organized labor\" is hostile to the use of the militia, still more of\r\nthe regular army, in any labor dispute or riot resulting therefrom. It\r\nis never justifiably hostile where actual offences are committed, but\r\nthere is something to be said, at least there is some precedent\r\nfor their hostility, in cases where by the accident of Federal\r\njurisdiction the whole power of the United States army is called in to\r\nback up the injunction of a judge, perhaps improperly issued. That is\r\nto say, if the parties to the dispute are citizens of the same State\r\nthe National government may not interfere except, of course, where\r\nthe mails or inter-State commerce are obstructed; but, by the mere\r\naccident that plaintiff and defendant come from different States--and\r\nthis may nearly always be made the case by the plaintiff corporation,\r\nif it be a citizen of another State than where it owns its mine or\r\noperates its mill--it may always pick out strike leaders, walking\r\ndelegates, who are citizens of another State, so that the litigation\r\nmay be brought in a United States court. If, then, the orders or\r\nprocesses of that Federal court be interfered with, under the law of\r\nour Constitution the entire Federal government, first the Federal\r\nmarshals and then the Federal army, may be called into the fight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nOF POLITICAL RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMost important of these are the right to assemble, and the right of\r\nfree election. The right of political assembly and petition is another\r\nprinciple which has been much broadened by American constitutions. In\r\nEngland the right of public meeting undoubtedly existed from early\r\ntimes, but it was tied to the right of petitioning Parliament, which\r\nobviously limited its scope; and always strongly contested by the\r\nkings. Many riot acts were passed, both by the Tudors and by the\r\nStuarts, which sought to limit and restrict it, and even to make any\r\nmeeting of more than twelve men a riotous and criminal assembly.\r\nIndeed, the history of the attempt of the authorities to prevent\r\nriotous assemblies quasi-political runs all the way from Jack Cade's\r\nRebellion in 1452 to the Philadelphia street railway strike in 1910.\r\nBy an Act of 1549 unlawful assemblies of twelve \"to alter laws or\r\nabate prices\" were made unlawful--one of the reasons that gave rise to\r\nthe English notion that a simple strike was criminal. This, however,\r\nhas nothing to do with the political right of assembly which, fully\r\nrecognized by the Massachusetts Body of Liberties in 1641, was not\r\ndefinitely established in England until the Bill of Rights of 1689.\r\nNow this principle is cardinal, and so far as I know none of the\r\nStates have legislated upon the subject, unless the limitation of\r\nthe injunction writ be such legislation. A statute of Henry VII gave\r\nspecial authority to the Court of Star Chamber over riots; which is\r\nprecisely the power now objected to by labor leaders when exercised by\r\ncourts of chancery. But it must be noted that this right of assembly\r\nonly extends to matters political, and does not cover a meeting held\r\nfor an end ordinarily unlawful, such as to bring about a riot or to\r\nwork oppression to others or an injury to the public.\r\n\r\nThe right of election, however, is much older in England. We find\r\nstatutes concerning the right of free election, that is, of allowing\r\nelectors to vote without interference or control, as early as 1275. It\r\nis for this reason that almost from the origin of the House of Commons\r\nit has been unlawful, or at least uncustomary, for peers of the realm\r\nto even speak pending elections to the House of Commons. That House\r\nalso vindicated its right to judge of elections against Elizabeth, and\r\nthe principle that it alone shall be the judge remains in full force\r\nin the United States, though in modern times in England given to the\r\ncourts. There is no constitutional principle in England as to the\r\nright of suffrage, which in early times was shared in by all free men,\r\nor at least landholders. It was in 1429 limited to the forty shillings\r\nfreeholders, which law has been relaxed by degrees ever since.\r\nOur early constitutions recognized both property and educational\r\nlimitations; these were all done away with at one time, except in\r\nMassachusetts and Rhode Island, the former retaining an educational,\r\nthe latter a property, qualification. They have now been abolished in\r\nthose States, but taken up in the South, for the purpose, of course,\r\nof disfranchising the negro vote.\r\n\r\nThe serious modern instance of interference with free election is that\r\nof the Federal government with State elections in the South during\r\nthe thirty years following the war. While such interference was never\r\nquite held unconstitutional, it was strongly felt to be so; and has\r\ntherefore disappeared from practical politics. The principle of free\r\nelection, therefore, remains again unquestioned, and is, indeed,\r\nstrengthened by considerable legislation aimed at the influencing\r\nof votes by employers, etc. Many States, for instance, require that\r\nElection Day shall be a holiday, or, at least, that all employers of\r\nlabor shall give part of the day, one or two hours at least, for the\r\nemployees to vote; and a number of States have statutes aimed at\r\nthe coercion of their vote by any promise of giving or withholding\r\nemployment, or otherwise, and the giving their pay to them in\r\nenvelopes upon which any political matter is printed. Bribery is\r\nnearly always made criminal and cause of permanent disfranchisement\r\nand disability to hold office, both to the person giving or receiving\r\nthe bribe, but there is more interesting legislation still aimed at\r\nany form of political corruption. Massachusetts led the way with a\r\nstatute which endeavors to make criminal any promise of employment or\r\nadvantage, or even for a corporation, at least, to employ any person\r\nat the recommendation of any member of the legislature. It is very\r\ndifficult to draw such laws to make them apply fairly, but they have\r\nbeen copied with even greater elaboration in many Southern States. The\r\nstatute of Alabama, for instance, covers nearly a page in describing\r\nthe various acts or promises which are thus forbidden to officers or\r\ncandidates for office.\r\n\r\nThen there is the long range of lobby acts aimed at the very serious\r\nabuse of lobbying. Massachusetts divides the offence, or rather the\r\nbusiness, into two general classes: First, the legislative counsel who\r\nappears before legislative committees in support or in opposition of\r\nmeasures. This practice, of course, is perfectly legitimate in many\r\ncases, but the law provides that his advocacy must be open, he must\r\ndisclose the client for whom he appears, if there be one, and at the\r\nend of his services file a statement of the counsel fees actually\r\nreceived. Such legislation, however, is easily evaded by the payment\r\nof an annual salary. Then there is the legislative agent or lobbyist,\r\nproperly so called, who does not openly appear before legislative\r\ncommittees, but waylays members of the legislature at their dwelling\r\nor meeting places, or elsewhere. He must also register as legislative\r\nagent by the Massachusetts law, and file an actual account of his\r\nreceipts and expenses. Such legislation properly observed would,\r\nof course, have made impossible the celebrated \"House of Mirth\"\r\nat Albany. Then there are many statutes against intimidation in\r\nelections, particularly in the South; and there were many acts of\r\nCongress passed under the Fourteenth Amendment, but these have\r\npractically all been held unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe form of the ballot is another matter that has been the subject of\r\nmuch legislation. Our States vary, as does still public opinion in\r\nEngland, between the extreme of providing by the Constitution itself\r\nfor the secrecy of the ballot, and the other extreme of requiring that\r\nall voting should be _viva voce_, as was formerly the case at least\r\nin Kentucky. Public opinion has universally settled in favor of the\r\nformer; and to protect the voter's freedom, the so-called Australian\r\nballot has very generally been adopted, the principle, of course,\r\nbeing a ballot on which all candidates' names are printed, with or\r\nwithout party designations, and against which the voter makes his\r\nmark. In their practical working, however, these laws depend on the\r\nsimplicity of the form; thus, it works very well in Massachusetts,\r\nwhere the form is simple and the ballot short, and very badly in New\r\nYork, where the contrary is the case. Opinion is pretty well united\r\non the advisability of the Australian ballot, the only remaining\r\ndifference being as to whether any party designations should be\r\nprinted. Most practical politicians desire that the name \"Republican\"\r\nor \"Democrat,\" or even that some party symbol like a star or flag,\r\nshould be affixed, which can be understood by the most illiterate\r\nvoter; also, that the voter should be allowed to make one cross\r\nopposite the word \"Republican\" or \"Democrat\" when he means to vote the\r\nwhole of the ticket, \"in order to give each candidate the benefit of\r\nthe full party strength.\" On the other side it is argued that all\r\nvoting should be intelligent and never blind, and that if the voter\r\ndoes not take the trouble to mark all the names on the ballot it\r\nsufficiently indicates that he is indifferent as to some of the\r\ncandidates even of his own party, and that his votes for them should,\r\ntherefore, not be counted.\r\n\r\nThe most significant of modern developments in legislation concerning\r\nvoting is the new practice of recognizing by law political parties,\r\nand of regulating by law the mode of their nominations. The old idea\r\nwas that the law took no notice of anything that happened until\r\nelection day, when it did regulate the mode of voting and counting\r\nthe votes; the law was supposed to be blind to political parties; the\r\npersons elected were merely the successful candidates. But first\r\nbegan the tendency to recognize parties in \"bi-partisan\" boards and\r\ncommissions; it became very usual to provide that State officials\r\nshould, when the office was held, or the function performed, by more\r\nthan one person, be elected or appointed from different parties. This,\r\nof course, works very well when there are but two parties, as indeed\r\nis usually the case. And now of late years the practice has grown up\r\nof regulating political matters _before_ the election day. Direct\r\nprimaries, caucuses regulated by law, the mode of nomination,\r\nnomination papers to be filed in a certain manner, the compulsory\r\nservice of men as candidates unless they comply with precise\r\nformalities of resignation, the joint caucus and the separate caucus,\r\nthe public nomination paper, the one-per-cent., three-per-cent. or\r\nfive-per-cent. rule whereby a party gains such official recognition\r\nonly by throwing such a percentage of votes at some previous\r\nelection--in short, all the mass of legislation of this kind is the\r\nmatter of the last few years. In the writer's opinion, with the\r\npossible exception of the public nomination paper, it is all mistaken.\r\nAimed at destroying the machine, it really intrenches the machine--the\r\nprofessional politician--in power. The general public will not, and\r\nshould not be compelled to do more work than is necessary. If they\r\nactually vote at election it is all that can fairly be asked of them\r\nand more than one-third of them do. They will not, and cannot, devote\r\ntheir time to politics all through the year. The result is that all\r\nsuch elaborate schemes simply throw the game into the hands of the\r\n\"town committee\" or other permanent professional body. If you have to\r\nhold a meeting in June, and give notice of a caucus in July, with\r\nas much formality as used to be required in publishing the bans of\r\nmarriage, and then on a certain day in August do something else, and\r\nin September something still more, and file with the Secretary of\r\nState nomination papers in October, and have everything complete ten\r\ndays before election day,--the ordinary citizens who usually awake to\r\nthe fact that there is an election about that time find it too late to\r\nhave any voice in the nomination. They go to the election itself to\r\nfind an official ballot with two machine candidates for each office,\r\nand no hope of electing, even were it possible to nominate, a third.\r\nIn the old days, when they discovered that an improper candidate\r\nhad been nominated, on the very eve of election they could arouse\r\nthemselves and defeat him; under all these complicated systems it is\r\ntoo late. One necessity for such legislation, however, arises from the\r\nAustralian ballot itself; when that ballot carries party designations,\r\nwho is to determine who is the official party candidate? This problem\r\nis not, however, insoluble. Indeed, it might be argued that it would\r\nbe an excellent test to require the various so-called party nominees\r\nto run together, leaving to the voter to determine who was the regular\r\none. Certainly the legalizing of conventions, caucuses, and other\r\nnominating machinery, has led to great scandals. Under such laws,\r\nwhoever first gets possession of the hall at the time named would seem\r\nto be the regular candidate. We have, therefore, in Massachusetts,\r\nseen the scandal of two groups of men making different nominations in\r\na loud voice at the same time, one at the front of the hall, and the\r\nother at the back, and the courts had to decide who was the regular\r\nnominee. In the opinion of most lawyers, they decided in favor of\r\nthose who ought to have been the nominees rather than of those who in\r\nfact were.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of many \"practical politicians,\" as well as others,\r\nthe whole mass of legislation that recognizes political parties and\r\napplies to anything happening up to the date of election, should be\r\nexpunged from the statutes. I would hardly make an exception even\r\nof the \"bi-partisan\" board. A board should be composed of the best\r\npersons, not necessarily party-colored; if there be any force in the\r\nargument for bi-partisan commissions, it should apply ten times as\r\nmuch to the judges, but there is no provision in any State of the\r\nUnion or in the National government for bi-partisan courts of law.\r\nMassachusetts, alone, so far as the writer is informed, of all the\r\nStates, by a certain tradition respects this principle. Very few\r\nMassachusetts governors replace a Democratic judge by a Republican, or\r\n_vice versa_.\r\n\r\nBut most significant of all political matters is the growing distrust\r\nof legislatures. Curiously enough, although there was a great distrust\r\nof the executive of the nation until within a very few years, that\r\nseems to have entirely passed away. Governors of States have too\r\nlittle power to inspire distrust in anybody. But that legislatures or\r\nrepresentatives of the people should fail to inspire their confidence\r\nis one of the most curious developments of modern politics. The matter\r\nhas been fully discussed elsewhere in this book. It is greatly to be\r\nlamented, for it tends to lower the character of the legislatures\r\nthemselves. The days are indeed far off when a man would prefer being\r\ngovernor of a State to president, ambassador, or judge of the Supreme\r\nCourt; or the State Senate to the national Congress. Part of this\r\nindifference is, of course, explicable; for with the perfection of our\r\ncivilization and the growing intelligence that most statutes have\r\nbeen enacted that are really needful, there is really less for the\r\nlegislatures to do. Then, also, the growing practice of giving a large\r\nshare of governmental, or even legislative, powers to boards and\r\ncommissions has narrowed the scope of legislation. Whatever be\r\nthe reason the fact is certain. Very few States now allow their\r\nlegislatures to sit _ad libitum_, and only six or seven States permit\r\nannual sessions. In nearly all States sessions are biennial, if\r\nnot, as in some Southern States, quadrennial. That is to say, the\r\nlegislature is only allowed to meet once in four years; and in more\r\nthan half the States the time of the session is limited to ninety,\r\nsixty, or even thirty days, or the pay of the legislators cut off at\r\nthe end of such period.\r\n\r\nA few States have laws aimed at corrupt elections, that is to say,\r\nlimiting the expenditure of candidates and requiring publicity. Most\r\nStates now forbid contributions by corporations, as does the Federal\r\ngovernment.[1] Thus, by the California law of 1893, expenditures are\r\nlimited to one hundred dollars for each candidate, or one thousand\r\ndollars by a committee, and in no case exceeding five per cent. of the\r\nsalary of the office for which the person is a candidate for one year,\r\nand the legitimate expenses are specified; that is to say, public\r\nmeetings, printing, postage, and head-quarters expenses. Probably\r\nno one regrets the prevalence of extravagant expenditures more than\r\npersons who are themselves in public life. If the bosses of many State\r\nmachines were consulted in private, they would agree that the only\r\nreally legitimate expenditures are the hiring of halls, and the\r\nmailing of at most one printed circular to every voter in the\r\ndistrict. The Missouri law of the same year fixes a limit of\r\nexpenditure of one dollar per hundred of votes thrown at the last\r\nelection for the office for which the person is a candidate, which,\r\nin an ordinary congressional district of say fifteen thousand voters,\r\nwould be one hundred and fifty dollars--certainly little enough.\r\nVoters very generally have to be registered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bill signed by President Taft, June, 1910.]\r\n\r\nAs is familiar to the reader, there has been a decided movement for\r\nthe direct election by the people of United States senators, a large\r\nmajority of the States, and the Democratic party in all States, having\r\nin the last few years expressed themselves in favor of a change in\r\nthat particular. Until within a few years it was thought only possible\r\nby Constitutional amendment, but the example of Oregon and other\r\nStates has shown that it may be done by means of a law providing for\r\nthe expression of the preference of the voters, and this may even be\r\nmade a party ballot. That is to say, voters at party caucuses, or\r\neven at elections where the ballots are so marked, may express their\r\npreference for this or that candidate for the United States Senate,\r\nand the moral obligation will then be on the State legislature, or\r\nat least on its members of the corresponding party, to vote for the\r\ncandidate so nominated. This has been universally done in the case\r\nof election of the United States President by the force of public\r\nopinion; no instance is on record of an elector having voted\r\ndifferently, or of a bribe or even of an attempt to bribe. But with\r\nlegislation--statute law not being so strong as the unwritten law,\r\ncontrary to the popular opinion--it is by no means certain that this\r\nresult will happen. The law has worked in Oregon, where first adopted,\r\nwith the striking result that a Republican legislature elected a\r\nDemocratic United States senator; but if the writer is correctly\r\ninformed, the contrary has been the case in Illinois. The movement for\r\nthe direct nomination of members of the lower house of Congress\r\nalso exists in many States. \"Direct nomination\" of course means a\r\nnomination by the mass of voters, either in assembly or by a written\r\nlist. The value of this reform is probably exaggerated. Direct\r\nnominations in the city of Boston recently had the somewhat amusing\r\nresult that there were two or three times as many names on the\r\nnominating petitions as voted in the election, and that one gentleman,\r\nindeed, fell short of his nominating petition by nearly ninety per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nThe mode of legislation is not much changed from the early days.\r\nUsually bills have in theory to be read three times and must be voted\r\nfor by a majority of a quorum. Many States forbid new legislation to\r\nbe attempted after the first few days of the session. There has in the\r\nlast few years been an effort at the proper drafting of bills, but it\r\nhas hardly made much progress as yet, and will be discussed in our\r\nfinal chapter.\r\n\r\nThe two most radical changes of all are, of course, the initiative and\r\nreferendum, and women's suffrage. The latter has, on the whole, made\r\nno progress since it was adopted in Colorado and three other States,\r\nabout the year 1890. The people of the States where it exists appear\r\nsatisfied and it is probable that they will never make the change\r\nback; on the other hand, the better opinion seems to be that the\r\nexistence of women's suffrage has not materially altered conditions or\r\nresults in any particular, except, possibly, that there is a little\r\nless disorder around the polling booths on election day. The largest\r\ncity in the world where women vote is Denver; and in hardly any\r\nAmerican town has the \"social evil\" been more openly prevalent or\r\npolitics more corrupt; while it has just voted _against_ prohibition.\r\nAs in the case of school suffrage, it is probable that a smaller\r\nproportion of women are now exercising the right of suffrage than when\r\nthe thing was a novelty. In all the neighboring States to the four\r\nwomen's suffrage States (Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, and Utah) a women's\r\nsuffrage amendment has been proposed to the Constitution, all the male\r\nvoters have been given a chance to vote on the question, and in every\r\ninstance it has been defeated by very large majorities. As has been\r\nintimated, the movement to extend the right of suffrage to women\r\nfor all matters connected with schools and education has also been\r\narrested. Many States had adopted this principle before the year 1895,\r\nbut few, if any, during the past fifteen years. The experience of\r\nMassachusetts, where sentiment was strongly for it, shows that the\r\nwomen take very little interest in the matter; an infinitesimal\r\npercentage of the total female population voting upon election day,\r\neven when a prominent woman was the leading candidate for the school\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nWomen's suffrage was adopted in Colorado in 1805, and rejected in\r\nKansas the same year; adopted in Idaho in 1890, and rejected in\r\nCalifornia; rejected in Washington and South Dakota in 1898; rejected\r\nin Oregon in 1900, in both Washington and Oregon, once at least since,\r\nand has been rejected by popular referendum in several other States.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, an intelligent tendency, notably in the South, to\r\nrecognize the right of women to vote as property owners upon matters\r\ninvolving the levying of taxes, or the \"bonding\" of cities, towns, or\r\ncounties, for public improvements or other purposes. Such laws exist\r\nin Texas, Louisiana, Michigan, and possibly other States, and in\r\nLouisiana the statute provides machinery by which women may on such\r\nmatters vote by mail. It is much to be wished that municipal affairs\r\nand municipal elections could be separated entirely from political\r\nones. That is to say, that a city or town might be run as a business\r\ncorporation on its business side, and in such elections have the\r\nproperty owners, both men and women, only vote. The trouble, of\r\ncourse, is that there are certain matters, notably the expenditure for\r\nschools, which is the largest, at least in Massachusetts cities\r\nand towns, which are in a sense both municipal and political, both\r\neconomic and affecting individual rights of persons not property\r\nowners. In any case, the matter must be considered outside of the\r\nsphere of \"practical politics.\" It is hardly likely that, except for\r\nsome special matter like the race question in the South, a State\r\nconstitution will ever be amended in a conservative direction. Allied\r\nwith this would be a proposition to deprive persons in receipt of\r\nwages or salary from a city of the vote at municipal elections.\r\nLaborers and employees in the employ of a large city like Boston\r\nalready form a very considerable percentage of the voters, and if you\r\nadd to them the employees on the public-service corporations, partly\r\nunder municipal control, you have probably got nearly one-third of\r\nthe total vote. Yet the vote could not be taken from them without an\r\namendment to the State constitution.\r\n\r\nOf the initiative and referendum much has been written. It exists in\r\nfull force, that is to say, as applying both to State elections and to\r\ncounty, city, or town elections, in several States, mostly in the far\r\nWest; and for partial purposes it exists in several more. \"Direct\r\nlegislation\" has been very popular as a political slogan during the\r\npast few years, but it has not been adopted as yet in any of the\r\nthirteen original States. The objections to it are fundamentally that\r\nit destroys the principle of representative government; that it takes\r\nresponsibility from the legislature with the result, probably, of\r\ngetting a more and more inferior type of man as State representative;\r\nthat it is unnecessary, inasmuch as any one may have any bill\r\nintroduced in the legislature to-day, and public sentiment be\r\neffectual to prevent the bill from being defeated; and finally, the\r\nobjection of inconvenience, that it is cumbrous and unmanageable to\r\nwork. Already the Secretary of State of Oregon complains that the laws\r\npassed by initiative are so badly written as to be unintelligible\r\nand conflicting, to say nothing of bad spelling and grammar. In one\r\ninstance, at least, an important statute, that for the initiative and\r\nreferendum itself, adopted by initiative, failed of effect because\r\nit contained no clause beginning \"Be it enacted,\" etc. Possibly with\r\npractice these objections might disappear. The more valuable part of\r\nthe reform is undoubtedly the referendum. The initiative is hardly\r\nnecessary, except by way of giving a referendum on measures which\r\notherwise would not emerge from the legislature; and there is a\r\ngrowing inclination to give a referendum on all laws or measures\r\ninvolving a grant of a franchise or of a right or privilege at the\r\nexpense of the general public, or the town or city concerned. This\r\nis a very distinct tendency, and throughout the Union the States are\r\nrapidly passing laws that where a State-wide franchise is given, an\r\nexemption from taxes, a rate-making power, or other privilege, it\r\nshall be submitted to all the voters, and corresponding measures,\r\nstreet-railway franchises, gas, light, water, or other public-service\r\ncorporations, acting only in definite localities, cities or towns,\r\nshall be referred in the appropriate locality.\r\n\r\nThe method of the State-wide initiative or referendum varies little in\r\nthe different States; usually, upon petition of from five to eight per\r\ncent. of the voters, or in cities and towns usually fifteen per cent.,\r\nlegislation may be initiated. It may then be either passed by the\r\nState legislature like an ordinary law, or be given to the referendum\r\nof the people, or both, and takes effect when adopted by a majority of\r\nthe voters at a general or special election. Constitutional amendments\r\nmay in some States be originated and adopted in the same manner. So\r\nfar as one can judge, the referendum in this country shows the same\r\ntendency that it has shown in Switzerland. Although a larger number\r\nof measures are doubtless submitted to the people, and especially\r\nmeasures of a class not to go through the ordinary legislature, when\r\ncontrolled by important interests, yet the vote itself at the final\r\nelection is apt to be somewhat conservative. The referendums upon\r\nwomen's suffrage, for instance, while the initiative was adopted by a\r\nlarge majority, were very decisively defeated at the polls, and it is\r\nsaid that last year's election in Oregon and Washington, with very\r\nnumerous and complex referendum measures, showed a surprising degree\r\nof intelligence on the part of the ordinary voter. Nevertheless, while\r\nit may be possible to submit to him one or two measures a year, if it\r\nwere to come to the submission of all legislation (and the States will\r\naverage from five hundred to one thousand statutes per year, at their\r\npresent output) it seems incredible that the voter should have time\r\nand intelligence, or even take the trouble, to mark his ballot\r\naccordingly; while it is obvious that the ballot itself, setting forth\r\nthe full law, would be considerably larger than the annual volumes of\r\nstatutes now are. This matter of practical convenience, however, may\r\nperhaps be expected to cure itself. I should conclude, therefore, that\r\nwhile the whole matter is an interesting experiment, the initiative\r\nis hardly necessary, and the referendum should be limited to\r\nconstitutional amendments (where it was always allowed) and to matters\r\nof definite local or public interest, like the granting of a franchise\r\nor an irrepealable contract of privilege.\r\n\r\nThe modern practice of putting everything into the State constitution\r\nwhich we have called attention to in other places, has led, of course,\r\nto a practical referendum on all most important matters, for no\r\nconstitution, with the exception of that of Virginia, has ever been\r\nadopted in any of our States except by the people at an election; and\r\nwith the tendency to require the submission of a new constitution\r\nevery twenty years, and to make the constitution itself so compendious\r\nas to cover a vast amount of matter, usually subjects of legislation,\r\nwith the consequent necessity of frequent amendment, we have now\r\nin our Southern States and some of the Western States a practical\r\nreferendum to the people of most important legislative matters every\r\nfew years.\r\n\r\nThe initiative and referendum was adopted in Iowa in 1891. As to bonds\r\nand debts of cities, etc., in Ohio in 1902. In Oregon, the general\r\ninitiative and referendum by constitutional amendment in 1903. As\r\nto franchises for public utilities only, in Wisconsin, Montana, and\r\nArizona the same year. As to Chicago, Illinois, in 1904, and in\r\nseveral States, what we will term the local or limited referendum,\r\nin the last four or five years. It was, however, defeated in\r\nMassachusetts, although adopted in Maine; and in Delaware the whole\r\nquestion was submitted to a commission to investigate.\r\n\r\nThe recall, a still more recent device than the initiative and\r\nreferendum, has, indeed, no precedent in the past, or in other\r\ncountries. In substance, it makes the tenure of office of an elective\r\nofficial dependent on the continuous good-will of the voters, or of\r\na certain proportion of the voters. Under the present charter of the\r\ncity of Boston, the mayor may be \"recalled\" upon petition of fifty per\r\ncent. of the registered voters--a proportion which practically makes\r\nthe recall impossible. Where, however, the initiative of the recall\r\ndepends on a small proportion and the result is determined by a simple\r\nmajority vote at the polls, it is easy to see that the mayor or other\r\nofficial would be in continuous apprehension, if he cared for his\r\noffice, and in any event would not be able to adopt and follow out any\r\ncontinuous policy. The terms of most of our officials are brief. A\r\nproposal to apply the \"recall\" to judges would, in the opinion of the\r\nwriter, be wicked, if not unconstitutional; as to all other officials,\r\nit would tend to destroy their efficiency, and in most cases be in\r\nitself ridiculous, at least as to short-term officers holding for only\r\none or two years.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noteworthy of political changes that have occurred in\r\nthe republic since the adoption of the Constitution in 1789, is that\r\naffecting the election and tenure of office of judges. Smith, in his\r\nbook on American State Constitutions, published shortly after the\r\nRevolution, tells us that at that time every State in the Union had\r\nits judges appointed by the executive for a life term. To-day, this\r\nprinciple survives only in the Federal courts and four States,\r\nNew Hampshire, Massachusetts, Maine, and Delaware, although in\r\nConnecticut, New Jersey, and Mississippi, the judges of the highest,\r\nor Supreme Court, are still appointed in this manner and for life. In\r\nVermont, Rhode Island, Virginia, and South Carolina, Supreme Court\r\njudges are elected by the two houses of the legislature in joint\r\nconvention, but in all other States, that is, universally in the West\r\nand Southwest, the judges are elected by the people of the States or\r\nof their respective districts. New York and Pennsylvania, however,\r\nhave very long terms, which by some is said to combine the advantages\r\nof both systems; in other States the term is from four to six years.\r\n\r\nIn matters judicial the field is far too vast to permit more than\r\nbriefest mention of the most important lines of popular legislation.\r\nIn the first place, common law and chancery jurisdiction are very\r\ngenerally fused and confounded. A few States still have chancellors\r\nentirely distinct from the common-law judges, and Massachusetts and\r\na few other States still keep chancery terms and chancery procedure\r\ndistinct from the common law. It is certainly a curious result that\r\nthe historic jealousy of chancery and all its works should have ended,\r\nin the most radical States of the Union, in their complete adoption of\r\nthe whole system of chancery with all its concomitants. As a result,\r\nthe injunction writ, originally the high prerogative of the crown and\r\nits highest officers, has now become the weapon of all judges, even\r\nin some States of inferior magistrates, and has been used with a\r\nconfusion and recklessness that have gone far to justify the complaint\r\nof labor interests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we have grown less jealous of preserving our\r\ncommon-law jury rights. Not only is much more provision made for the\r\nwaiver of jury trial in all States, at least in criminal cases,\r\nand for a trial by the court without a jury unless it be specially\r\nclaimed, but there is a distinct tendency to have juries less\r\nthan twelve in number, and verdicts not unanimous, but made up of\r\nthree-fourths, two-thirds, or even a simple majority; while our\r\nindifference to common-law rights shown in our multiplication of\r\nboards and commissioners has already been commented on.\r\n\r\nLegislation on the law of evidence has been on two main lines,\r\noriginally, of course, under the Federal Constitution, to destroy all\r\nreligious tests, and permit an atheist or person of heathen religion\r\nto testify upon simple affirmation, or according to his religious\r\ntenets. Universally, persons charged with crime have been permitted\r\nto testify in their own defence, with the common provision that no\r\ninference shall be drawn from their not doing so. Of course, by\r\nour Constitution itself, they were given the right to counsel and\r\ncompulsory process for obtaining evidence on their own behalf, neither\r\nof which rights existed under the old common law; and then almost\r\nuniversally the wife is permitted to testify against the husband or in\r\nhis behalf, especially in cases involving controversy between them;\r\nwhile, as she is very generally given the right to make contracts even\r\nwith the husband, she is naturally given the right to enforce the same\r\nin civil courts as well.\r\n\r\nIt is in procedure that our legislation is least efficient. Having\r\nlittle knowledge of the subject, legislatures have been shy of\r\nmeddling with court rules and processes; while the very fact that the\r\nlegislatures have taken unto themselves the right so to interfere,\r\nhas seemed to impress both bench and bar with a certain sense of\r\nirresponsibility. I fear we must admit that the judges of England,\r\naided by its bar, have been far more solicitous of speedy and simple\r\nprocedure and trial than have the courts of this country. Some Western\r\nStates have crudely tried to meet the difficulty, as by providing that\r\nall judges must render an opinion within sixty days, or other brief\r\nperiod, after a case is argued before them, or even by limiting the\r\nnumber of witnesses to be called! But it may be feared that so long\r\nas public sentiment rather demands every possibility of evasion of\r\nexecution than that a guilty person should be promptly and summarily\r\npunished, little can be hoped for from the legislatures. Such progress\r\nas has been made in this direction has universally been under the\r\nurgent instance of the lawyers themselves, acting through the State\r\nor Federal bar associations. But the judges themselves must venture a\r\nstricter control of irrelevant testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nOTHER LEGISLATION AFFECTING INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLegislation concerning freedom of speech and its limitations, the\r\nlaw of slander and libel, hardly exists in America, except only\r\nthe efforts of newspapers to be free of the consequences of libels\r\npublished by them, provided they publish a retractation; and the\r\nefforts of the people to protect their reputation and right to\r\nprivacy, as by laws like that of the State of Pennsylvania prohibiting\r\nridiculous or defamatory cartoons, even of persons in public life; and\r\nthe legislation already attempted in some States to prohibit the use\r\nof a person's likeness for advertising purposes, or to protect them\r\nfrom the kodak fiend, or even to establish a general right to privacy\r\nas to their doings, engagements, social entertainments, etc., when\r\nthey are of no legitimate interest to the public. Legislation in these\r\ndirections has, however, only made a beginning.\r\n\r\nThe newspaper-libel laws usually provide that the retractation shall\r\nbe a defence to a libel suit, at least if published in as large a type\r\nand in as conspicuous a manner as the original article complained of;\r\nsometimes they only provide that in such cases the newspaper shall be\r\nrelieved of all but actual damages. The wisdom of such legislation is\r\nquestionable, as the old adage runs: \"A lie will travel around the\r\nworld while the truth is putting on its boots\"; moreover, it is\r\nquestionable whether they are not class legislation in extending to a\r\ncertain form of business or a certain trade a protection which is not\r\nextended to others. There has been much legislation preventing\r\nthe advertising of patent medicines, immoral remedies, divorce\r\nadvertisement, and such matters. Some newspapers have objected to it,\r\nbut the right of freedom of the press does not include the right to\r\nthe use of the mails, and the papers containing the objectionable\r\nadvertisements may constitutionally be seized or denied delivery,\r\njust as convict-made goods may be denied circulation in interstate\r\ncommerce, by act of Congress, not, of course, of the States. Mr.\r\nGompers, of the American Federation of Labor, has complained that the\r\ninjunction of their so-called \"unfair list\" is an interference with\r\nthe freedom of the press, and I presume would claim that an injunction\r\nagainst urging, or combining to urge, by oral argument, the members of\r\nthe various unions throughout the country to boycott a certain person,\r\nwould be an interference with the right of freedom of speech, and that\r\ntherefore if the courts did not so decide, the laws should be changed\r\nby statute. This, also, would seem open to the objection of class\r\nlegislation if extended only to speech or publication in industrial\r\ndisputes. It should be noted, however, that the broad principle of\r\nfreedom of speech by all persons and at all places is first adopted\r\nin the American constitutions, freedom of speech in England in its\r\nhistorical principles extending only to freedom of speech in the House\r\nof Parliament, and the right of assembly and petition at a public\r\nmeeting; freedom of the press, however, is the same constitutional\r\nprinciple in both countries, but only extends to the right to publish\r\nwithout previously obtaining the consent of any censor or other\r\nauthority, and the person publishing still remains responsible for\r\nall damages caused by such act. It is this part of the law which Mr.\r\nGompers would alter, or rather make absolute; so that any notice or\r\nthreat could be printed and circulated even when a component act of a\r\nconspiracy.\r\n\r\nBy a recent act of Congress the right of freedom of speech does not\r\nextend to anarchistic utterances, or speeches or writings aimed\r\nagainst order, the established government, and inciting to\r\nassassination or crime. Such laws are barely constitutional as applied\r\nto United States citizens. The unpopularity of the alien and sedition\r\nlaws under the administration of John Adams will be remembered. Since\r\ntheir repeal, no attempt at a law of government libel has been made;\r\nvery recently, however, where certain gentlemen, mostly holding\r\nimportant government offices, were charged with having made money\r\nout of the Panama Canal purchase, the weight and influence of the\r\nadministration was given to the attempt to indict them and bring them\r\nto the courts of the central government at Washington for trial. This\r\nattempt, however, failed in the courts, as, in the Wilkes case, it had\r\nfailed more than a century before at the bar of public opinion.\r\n\r\nBut the law is, of course, much stronger as to persons not citizens.\r\nThat is to say, no one has any right to immigrate into this country,\r\nand therefore intending immigrants may be kept out by legislation if\r\nthey are anarchists, socialists, or, indeed, hold any opinion for the\r\nmoment unpopular with Congress. The attempt has so far, however, not\r\nbeen made to keep out any but violent anarchists, and, of course,\r\npersons who are diseased, of immoral life, or likely to become a\r\npublic charge. And the attempt to keep them under the hand of the\r\ncentral government for years after they have taken their place for\r\ngood or ill in the State body politic has recently failed in a\r\nmonumental case vindicating anew the Tenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nConnected in most people's mind with the right of privacy is the right\r\nof a person to keep his house and his private papers to himself; but\r\nit bears no relation whatever to the very new-fangled notion of a\r\ngeneral right to privacy. The two principles are that an Englishman's\r\nhouse is his castle. His home, even though it be but one room in\r\na tenement, may not be invaded by anybody, even by any government\r\nofficial or authority (except, of course, under modern sanitary police\r\nregulation), without a written warrant specifying the reason for\r\nsuch invasion, some offence with which the man is charged, and some\r\nparticular document or paper, or other evidence of which they are in\r\nsearch. The principle against general warrants--that is, warrants\r\nspecifying no definite offence or naming no particular person--was\r\nestablished in Massachusetts in Colony times, and the principle taken\r\nover to England and affirmed by Lord Camden--one of the two or three\r\ncelebrated examples where we have given a new constitutional principle\r\nback to the mother country. Now, closely connected with this is\r\nanother principle that a man shall not be compelled to testify in a\r\ncriminal matter against himself, or that, if so compelled by statute\r\nor official, he shall then forever be immune from prosecution for\r\nany crime revealed by such testimony; the wording of the earlier\r\nconstitutional provisions was \"in a criminal offence,\" but by modern,\r\nmore liberal interpretation, it has been extended to any compulsory\r\ntestimony, whether given in a criminal proceeding or not. This, with\r\nthe principle protecting a man's private affairs from inquisition, is\r\nexpressed in our Fourth and Fifth Amendments, the former prohibiting\r\nunreasonable searches and general warrants, and the latter providing\r\nthat no one shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness\r\nagainst himself, nor deprived of property without due process of law,\r\nand it has reasonably been argued that an inquisition into a person's\r\nbusiness or book of accounts is such deprivation of his property\r\nwithout due process of law, at least when applied to a natural person.\r\nI find no legislation limiting these important principles, but on\r\nthe contrary the tendency in modern statutes and modern State\r\nconstitutions is to extend and generalize them. Of such is the famous\r\nclause of the recent constitutions of Kentucky and Wyoming that\r\n\"absolute arbitrary power over the lives, liberty, and property\r\nof freemen exists nowhere in a republic, not even in the largest\r\nmajority.\" In view of the frequently successful efforts of trust\r\nmagnates and others to escape indictment or punishment by some\r\nenforced revelation of their affairs given after a criminal proceeding\r\nhas has been commenced or before a grand jury, legislation is now\r\nstrongly urged to withhold them immunity in such cases. This would\r\nrelegate us to the early state of things where they would simply\r\nrefuse to answer, so that it may be doubted if, on the whole, we\r\nshould gain much. The right of an Englishman not to criminate himself\r\nis too cardinal in our constitutional fabric to be questioned or to be\r\naltered without subverting the whole structure. Practically it would\r\nseem as if a little more intelligence on the part of our prosecutors\r\nwould meet the evil. Corporations themselves are never immune; and\r\nunless the wicked official actually slept with all the books of the\r\ncorporation under his pillow, it would be hard to imagine a case where\r\nsome corporate clerk or subordinate officer could not be subpoenaed\r\nto produce the necessary evidence. Indeed, as has been well argued by\r\nleading American publicists, the sooner the public learns to go behind\r\nthe figment of the corporation, the screen of the artificial person,\r\ninto the human beings really composing it, the quicker we shall arrive\r\nat a cure for such evils as may exist. Legislation punishing or even\r\nfining an offending corporation is in the last sense ridiculous. It is\r\nnecessarily paid by the innocent stockholders or the public. There\r\nis always some one person or a number of persons who have _done_\r\nor suffered the things complained of; after all, every act of the\r\ncorporation is necessarily done by some one or more individuals. We\r\nmust get over our metaphysical habit of treating corporations as\r\nabstract entities, and again recognize that they are but a definite\r\nnumber of natural persons bound together only for a few definite\r\ninterests and with real men as officers who should be fully\r\nresponsible for their actions. Indeed, it ought to be simpler to\r\ndetect and punish offenders than in the case of mere individuals\r\nunincorporated, for the very fact that a corporation keeps books and\r\nacts under an elaborate set of by-laws and regulations gives a clew to\r\nits proceedings, and indicates a source of information as to all its\r\nacts. One clerk may therefore reveal, and properly reveal, books and\r\nletters which shall incriminate \"those above\"; one employee may show\r\nten thousand persons guilty of an unlawful combination, and properly\r\nso. There is no reason why he should not, and the nine thousand nine\r\nhundred and ninety-nine others deserve, and are entitled to, no\r\nimmunity whatever from his revelation.\r\n\r\nThe religious rights, although for the most part peculiar to the\r\nAmerican Constitution, adopted by us, indeed, as a result of the\r\nhistory of the two or three centuries preceding in England, but hardly\r\nin any particular a part of the British Constitution, were by the\r\nreason of our very origin so strongly asserted and so highly valued\r\nwith us that no legislation has been found necessary on the subject.\r\nPerhaps the sole important instance in which the question has come up\r\nhas been that of instruction in the public schools and the use of the\r\nmoney raised by common taxation for special religious purposes. Very\r\ngenerally the latter is forbidden in our State constitutions, the\r\nFederal Constitution by the First Amendment merely protecting the\r\nright from the action of Congress. Owing to decisions of the\r\nSupreme Court, in the South it has become possible to divide school\r\nappropriations between schools for whites and blacks, and it is\r\npresumable that the same thing might be done as, for instance, between\r\nRoman Catholics and others, and something of the sort has, I believe,\r\nbeen done with the appropriations for the education of Indians.\r\n\r\nThe few statutes we find upon this matter tend to still further extend\r\nand liberalize religious rights. Almost universally now a man is not\r\nforbidden from testifying or being a witness by reason of his belief\r\nor disbelief, even when he is an atheist. The latter law is not,\r\nhowever, quite universal. He must, in some States, believe at least in\r\nthe existence of God, or of a future state of reward or punishment.\r\nMormons, at one time, claimed the right to practise polygamy as a\r\npart of their religion guaranteed to them by the Constitution; the\r\ncontention did not prevail; on the contrary the Mormon States were\r\nmade to submit to an enabling act under which they bound themselves to\r\nadopt State constitutions providing for all time against polygamous\r\npractices. Such a treaty is not, of course, binding upon a sovereign\r\nState unless Mormonism be deemed inconsistent with a republican form\r\nof government; so that Utah, for instance, has probably the right to\r\nre-establish Mormonism to-morrow so far as the Federal Constitution\r\nis concerned. Whether it would be permitted by a strenuous president\r\nhaving public sentiment at his back may indeed be questioned. In\r\nlike manner, Christian Science practitioners have invoked the\r\nconstitutional right of religious belief against the common law\r\nrequiring that those offering themselves to practise medicine should\r\nbe reasonably skilled in their trade. Legislation permitting Christian\r\nScientists to practise freely has been attempted in nearly all the\r\nStates, but has not, so far as I am informed, succeeded in any,\r\nalthough a good many States have adopted statutes extending the right\r\nto osteopaths. Under the common law of England, re-established in\r\nMassachusetts by a famous decision[1] twenty years ago, a person\r\nholding himself out as a surgeon or medical practitioner, who is\r\nabsolutely uninstructed and ignorant, is guilty even of criminal\r\nnegligence, and responsible for the death of his patient, even to the\r\npoint of manslaughter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Commonwealth _v_. Pierce, 138 Mass. 165.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nLEGISLATION CONCERNING PERSONAL AND RACIAL RIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is, of course, a matter of which books might be, and indeed have\r\nbeen, written; our general essay on popular legislation can do no more\r\nthan summarize past law-making and the present trend of legislatures,\r\nmuch as some history of the people of England might broadly state the\r\neconomic facts and laws of the Corn-law period in England. Racial\r\nlegislation may, of course, be considered from the point of view of\r\nthe negro, the Indian, and the alien, and indeed it differs much in\r\nall three. Other personal legislation is largely concerned with the\r\nright to exercise trade, already discussed, and the questions of\r\nmarriage and divorce we reserve for the next chapter. In the past we\r\nhave been very unjust, not to say cruel, to the Indian, and though\r\nnaturally in some respects a high-natured race, have constantly denied\r\nhim any political share in the government, and only in the very last\r\nfew years grudgingly extended it to such Indians as renounce their\r\ntribe and adopt the habits and mode of life of the white man, or, as\r\nin early England, to such freeholders as acquire a quarter section of\r\nland. In the negro's case, however, we atoned for the early crime of\r\nenslavement by the sentimental hurry with which we endeavored in the\r\n'60's and '70's of the last century to take him up by law and force\r\nhim into exact equality, social as well as political, with the white\r\nman. To aliens, in the third hand, we have been consistently generous,\r\nhaving shown only in the very last few years any attempt whatever to\r\nexclude the most worthless or undesirable; except that the prejudice\r\nagainst the Mongolian in the far West is quite as bitter as it ever\r\nwas against the negro in the South, and he is still sternly refused\r\ncitizenship, even national citizenship, which we freely extend to the\r\nAfrican. We are thus left in the ridiculous situation of providing\r\nthat nobody may be a citizen of our great Republic except a white\r\nCaucasian and a black African, with considerable ambiguity still as\r\nto what the word \"white\" means. The American Indians are, indeed,\r\nadmitted under the conditions before mentioned, so that as a\r\ncatch-word the reader may remember that we are a red, white, and black\r\ncountry, but not a brown or yellow one. All this is, of course,\r\nthe accident of history; but the accidents of history are its most\r\nimportant incidents.\r\n\r\nTaking Asiatic races first, the far Western States vie with each other\r\nin passing legislation which shall deny them the right to life, or at\r\nleast to live upon any equality of competition with the white. Most of\r\nsuch laws are, of course, unconstitutional, but they were at one time\r\nenacted with more rapidity than the Supreme Court of the United States\r\ncould declare them so. Congress tries to be more reasonable and,\r\nindeed, has to be so, in view of the fact that it is a national\r\nCongress living, with the executive, in direct touch with the foreign\r\nnations themselves. Broadly speaking, our national legislation is to\r\nexclude immigration, but guarantee equality of property right, at\r\nleast, to such Mongolian aliens as are actually in the country; and\r\nto extend or guarantee such right of treatment by treaties, which\r\ntreaties are, of course, acts of Congress, like any other act of\r\nCongress, entirely valid in favor of the foreign power and enforceable\r\nby it even to the issue of war, but possibly, as a constitutional\r\nquestion, not enforceable by the Federal government against the\r\nStates. An endless mass of legislation in California and other Western\r\nStates has been devised, either openly against the Chinese or so\r\ncouched as to really exclude them from the ordinary civic liberties,\r\nand most of our State laws or courts declare that the Japanese are\r\nMongolian although that people deny it. Many statutes, moreover,\r\nare aimed at Asiatics in general; which would possibly include the\r\nHindoos, who are of exactly the same race as ourselves. Indeed, some\r\njudges have excluded Hindoos from naturalization, or persons of\r\nSpanish descent, while admitting negroes, which is like excluding your\r\nimmediate ancestors in favor of your more remote Darwinian ones.\r\nEven in New York and other Eastern States, the employment of aliens,\r\nparticularly Asiatics, is forbidden in all public work--which laws\r\nmay be invalid as against a Federal treaty. Yet statutes against the\r\nemployment of any but citizens of the United States in public works\r\nare growing more frequent than ever, and seem to me quite within the\r\nrights of the State itself to determine. But Pennsylvania could not\r\nimpose a tax of three cents per day upon all alien laborers, to be\r\npaid by the employer. Many States are beginning to provide against\r\nthe ownership of land by aliens. This, of course, is perfectly\r\nconstitutional and has full justification in the history and precedent\r\nof most other countries, and as applied to foreign corporations it is\r\nstill more justifiable; and the Western States very generally provide\r\nagainst the ownership of land, other than such as may be taken on\r\nmortgage, by foreign corporations, or corporations even of which a\r\nlarge proportion of the stock is held by foreigners.\r\n\r\nRacial legislation as to negroes may be divided into laws bearing on\r\ntheir legal, political, and social rights, including, in the latter,\r\ncontracts of labor and of marriage. By the Thirteenth, Fourteenth, and\r\nFifteenth Amendments, all adopted within ten years after the war, we\r\nendeavored to put the negro in a legal, a political, and a social\r\nequality with whites in every particular. A broad statement,\r\nsufficiently correct for the general reader, may be made that only\r\nthe legal part has succeeded or has lasted. That legislation which is\r\naimed at social equality, all of it Federal legislation, has generally\r\nproved unconstitutional, and that part which has been aimed at\r\npolitical equality has, for one reason or another, been inefficient.\r\nMoreover, the great attempt in the Fourteenth Amendment to place\r\nthe ordinary social, civil, and political rights of the negro, and\r\nnecessarily, therefore, of every one else, under the _aegis_ of the\r\nFederal government, Federal courts, and Federal legislation, has been\r\nnullified; first, by court decision, and later, if we may trust the\r\nsigns of the times, by contemporary public opinion. The only thing\r\nthat remains is that the States cannot make laws which, on their face,\r\nare discriminations against the negro, or in social matters against\r\nany other race; and in political matters, the Fifteenth Amendment has\r\nproved effective to render null State laws which on their face are\r\ndesigned to restrict or deny their equal right of suffrage.\r\n\r\nLegislation concerning labor, the industrial condition, and contract\r\nrights of the negro, such as the peonage laws, we have considered\r\nin an earlier chapter; both State and national laws exist, and the\r\nThirteenth Amendment, being self-executing, has proved effective.\r\nUnder the Fifteenth Amendment there is little political legislation,\r\nexcept the effort in Southern States by educational or property\r\nqualifications, and most questionably by the so-called \"grandfather\r\nclause,\" to exclude most negroes from the right of suffrage. Laws\r\nimposing property and educational qualifications are, of course,\r\nvalid, although designed to have the effect of excluding a large\r\nproportion of the negroes from voting; laws, on the other hand, which\r\ngive a permanent right of suffrage to the descendants of a certain\r\nclass, as of those voters, all white, who were entitled to vote in\r\nSouthern States in the year 1861, are probably unconstitutional as\r\nestablishing an hereditary privileged class, though there has as yet\r\nbeen no square decision on this point by the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States. But as there is no further legislation on these\r\nsubjects, to pursue the matter further would carry us into\r\nconstitutional law.\r\n\r\nIn the third field, that of social legislation, there has been a\r\nvast number of laws, first by Congress with the intention, under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment, of enforcing social and industrial equality and\r\nproviding Federal machinery for securing it (the great substance of\r\nthis has been held unconstitutional and has passed away); later by the\r\nStates, usually the Southern States, with the exactly opposite purpose\r\nof separating the races, at least in social matters, and of subjecting\r\nthem to a stricter law of labor contract than has, in our country at\r\nleast, been imposed upon other citizens.\r\n\r\nEven this matter of social legislation, which alone remains to be\r\ndiscussed in this book, is quite too vast for more than a brief\r\nsketch. Among the many monographs on the subject may be mentioned the\r\narticle of G.T. Stevenson on the \"Separation of the Races in Public\r\nConveyances.\"[1] Even this comparatively narrow matter is by no means\r\nexhausted in an article covering twenty pages. Much of the social\r\nseparation of the races is, of course, brought about without statute\r\nlaw, but by custom, or even we may say customary law, which is always\r\napt to be the better enforced; and under the civil rights decisions of\r\nthe United States Supreme Court in 1883, such customary law has been\r\nrendered immune from Federal control. Legislation now exists in all\r\nSouthern States as to separate, though equal, accommodations in public\r\nconveyances; at one time such statutes were restricted to interstate\r\ncommerce, but the present tendency of court decision appears to be to\r\nrecognize even their interference with interstate commerce as part\r\nof the reasonable State police jurisdiction. Such statutes apply\r\ngenerally to railroads, steamboats, and street cars, or other\r\nconveyances of transportation. They are not so usual as to hotels,\r\neating-houses, theatres, or other public places, probably because\r\nin such it is more easy to secure the desired segregation without\r\nlegislation. We may, therefore, conclude that legislation on this\r\npoint will be universal in the South and in Oklahoma or other\r\nborder States with Southern sympathies, and will not be declared\r\nunconstitutional by the courts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _American Political Science Review_, vol. III, No. 2,\r\n1909.]\r\n\r\nThe labor unions very generally exclude negroes, both in the South\r\nand North, and in many Southern States the whites refuse to work with\r\nnegroes in mills. Until and unless labor unions are chartered or\r\nincorporated under legislation forbidding such action, it is probable\r\nthat their by-laws excluding negroes, though possibly unreasonable at\r\nthe common law, could not be reached by the Fourteenth Amendment; and\r\npublic sentiment in the States where such by-laws are common would\r\nprobably prevent any permanent vindication of the right of the negro\r\nto join labor unions by State courts. That is to say, countervailing\r\nlegislation would promptly be adopted.\r\n\r\nComing to education, the same principle seems to be established, that\r\nif the facilities are equal the education may be separate for the\r\ndifferent races, just as it may be for the different sexes; and it\r\nwould even appear that when the appropriation is not adequate for\r\ngiving higher or special education to both races, particularly when\r\nthere are few negroes applying for it, high-schools or special schools\r\nmay be established for whites alone.\r\n\r\nComing to the matter of sexual relation, a different principle\r\napplies. Under their unquestioned power of defining crimes, their\r\npolice power in criminal and sanitary matters, the States may forbid\r\nor make criminal miscegenation. Cohabitation without marriage may, of\r\ncourse, be forbidden to all classes, and in the case of cohabitation\r\nbetween white and black the penalty may be made more severe, for\r\nit has been held that as both parties to the offence are punished\r\nequally, there is, under such statutes, no denial of the equal\r\nprotection of the law. _A fortiori_, marriage may be forbidden or\r\ndeclared null between persons of different race, and the tendency so\r\nto do is increasing very decidedly in the South, and is certainly not\r\ndecreasing in the North. Indeed, constitutional amendments are being\r\nadopted and proposed having this in view, \"the purity of the race.\"\r\nRecent plays and magazine articles, with which most of our readers\r\nwill be familiar, sufficiently bear out this point.\r\n\r\nIn property rights, however, I can find no legislation which\r\ndiscriminates against the negro, and there is some in his favor. With\r\nthe exception of the labor or peonage laws, discussed separately,\r\nI have found no legislation which limits his property or contract\r\nrights. On the other hand, there is, in the several States,\r\nlegislation requiring that he shall be given life or health insurance\r\npolicies on the same terms and conditions as are applied to whites,\r\ndespite the alleged fact that his expectation of life is less and\r\nnot so easy to determine, owing to the lack of information as to\r\nthe health and longevity of his forebears. Sketching first thus our\r\ngeneral conclusions it remains for us only to give a few concrete\r\nexamples drawn from the legislation of the last twenty years:\r\n\r\nIn 1890, soon after the civil-rights cases were decided, we find some\r\nState legislation to protect the negro in his civil rights; but the\r\nfirst \"Jim Crow\" laws, providing for separation in public conveyances,\r\netc., began in 1865 and 1866 in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas, and\r\nare continued in other States in this year. In 1892 there are laws for\r\nseparate refreshment rooms and bath-houses, and providing that negroes\r\nand whites shall not be chained together in jails. In 1893 there is\r\nlegislation for separate barber shops, and the first law requiring\r\nequal treatment by life-insurance companies is passed in\r\nMassachusetts. In 1895 there is legislation against the mixture of\r\nraces in schools. In 1898 the laws and constitutional provisions for\r\npractical negro disfranchisement begin in South Carolina, Mississippi,\r\nand Louisiana. On the other hand, in 1900, New York passes a statute\r\nthat there shall be no separate negro schools, and in 1901 Illinois\r\nadopts civil-rights laws, followed in 1905 by five other States. In\r\n1907 South Carolina makes it a misdemeanor to serve meals at station\r\neating-houses to whites and blacks in the same room. In 1908 Maryland\r\nand Oklahoma provide for separate cars and separate rooms. In 1894\r\nwe find nine States prohibiting miscegenation. In 1902 Florida makes\r\nmiscegenation a felony, and in 1908 Louisiana declares concubinage\r\nbetween a Caucasian and a negro to be also a felony, while Oklahoma\r\nadopts the miscegenation law.\r\n\r\nThese examples of legislation are not intended to be exhaustive, but\r\nwill serve to give the reader a general Idea of the trend of popular\r\nlaw-making in this important matter.\r\n\r\nPersonal privilege, depending not upon race, but upon legislation, or\r\ninheritance, is, of course, strictly forbidden in each State by both\r\nconstitutions, State and Federal. The growth of a contrary principle\r\nis only noteworthy on the two lines touching respectively the whites\r\nin the South and veterans of wars in the North. It must be said that\r\nlegislation in the interest of the Grand Army of the Republic, and\r\neven of the veterans of the Spanish War, and even in some States of\r\nthe sons or descendants of such veterans respectively, has come very\r\nnear the point of hereditary or social privilege. The struggles of\r\nso-called \"Organized Labor\" to establish a privileged caste have so\r\nfar been generally unsuccessful, always so in the courts, and usually\r\nso in the legislatures; but in many States those who have enlisted in\r\neither wars, Civil or Spanish, wholly irrespective of actual service\r\nor injury, are entitled not only to pensions, Federal and State, but\r\nto a diversity of forms of State aid, to general preference in public\r\nemployment, and even to special privilege or exemption from license\r\ntaxes, etc., in private trades, and their children or descendants are,\r\nin many States, entitled to special educational privilege, to support\r\nin State schools or industrial colleges, to free text-books, and other\r\nadvantages. Presumably some of these matters might be successfully\r\ncontested in the courts, but they never have been. As to pensions,\r\nnothing here need be said. The reader will remember the familiar fact\r\nthat our pensions in time of peace now cost more than the maintenance\r\nof the entire German army on a war footing or than the maintenance of\r\nour own army. The last pensioner of the Revolutionary War, which\r\nended in 1781--that is to say, the last widow of a Revolutionary\r\nsoldier--only died a few years ago, early in the twentieth century.\r\nThe Order of the Cincinnati, founded by Washington and Lafayette, was\r\nnevertheless a subject of jealous anxiety to our forefathers; but\r\napparently the successful attempt of volunteers disbanded after\r\nthe Civil and the Spanish Wars, although far more menacing because\r\nembodying social and political privilege, not a mere badge of honor,\r\nseems to call forth but little criticism.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII\r\n\r\nSEX LEGISLATION, MARRIAGE AND DIVORCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe notion that a woman is in all respects a citizen, entitled to\r\nall rights, political as well as property and social, was definitely\r\ntested before our Supreme Court soon after the adoption of the\r\nFourteenth Amendment, on the plea that the wording of that amendment\r\ngave a renewed recognition to the doctrine that a woman was a person\r\nborn or naturalized in the United States and therefore a citizen and\r\nentitled to the equal protection of the laws. The court substantially\r\ndecided [1] that she was a citizen, was entitled to the equal\r\nprotection of the laws, but not to political privileges or burdens any\r\nmore than she was liable to military service. The State constitutions\r\nof many States, among them Illinois, have provided that a woman is\r\nentitled to all ordinary rights of property and contract \"the same as\"\r\na man. Under this provision, when laws were passed for the protection\r\nof women, forbidding them to work more than a certain number of hours\r\nper day, they were originally held unconstitutional. The so-called\r\nwomen's-rights people (one could wish that there were a better or more\r\nrespectful word) seem themselves to be divided on this point. The more\r\nradical resent any enforced inequality, industrial or social, between\r\nthe sexes. For instance, many States have statutes forbidding women or\r\ngirls to serve liquor in saloons or to wait upon table in restaurants\r\nwhere liquor is served. Such statutes, obviously moral, are\r\nnevertheless resented. On the other hand, the Supreme Court of the\r\nUnited States has taken the conservative view, that there is a\r\ndifference both in physique and character between the sexes, as well\r\nas different responsibilities and a different social interest, so that\r\nit is still possible, as It has been possible in the past, to impose\r\nby law special restrictions on the contracts of women. The law of\r\nOregon, therefore, not permitting them to make personal contract for\r\nmore than eight hours per day was sustained both in the State and the\r\nFederal Supreme Courts; and a similar law by the highest court of\r\nIllinois, reversing its own prior decision.[2] This matter is of such\r\ninterest and of such importance that it is frequently placed in State\r\nconstitutions, and it seems worth while to summarize their provisions.\r\nThe advanced position is now squarely put only in the constitution of\r\nCalifornia, which provides that no person shall on account of sex\r\nbe disqualified from entering upon or pursuing any lawful business,\r\nvocation, or profession. Such a constitution as this would, of course,\r\nmake it impossible even to pass such laws as the ones just mentioned\r\nforbidding them to serve in restaurants, such employment being lawful\r\nas to men. But no other State follows that extreme provision, and,\r\nindeed, the clause in the constitution of Illinois seems now to have\r\nbeen repealed.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Minor _v_. Happersett, 21 Wallace 166.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See above, p. 227.]\r\n\r\nAs to property matters it may be broadly stated that they have in\r\ngeneral precisely the same rights that men have, and in several States\r\nmore; that is to say, a woman frequently has a larger interest in the\r\nproperty of a man at his death, than the man has in hers, should she\r\npredecease him; and universally she is given a share of the husband's\r\nproperty in case of divorce, either outright or by way of alimony,\r\nwhich, so far as I know, is never awarded to the man even if he be the\r\ninnocent party. In New Jersey and some other States, a married woman\r\nis not permitted to guarantee or endorse the notes or debts of\r\nher husband. Many of the Southwestern States, from Louisiana to\r\nCalifornia, recognize or adopt the French idea of community property.\r\nBy the Mississippi constitution \"the legislature shall never create by\r\nlaw any distinction between the rights of men and women to acquire,\r\nown, enjoy, and dispose of property of all kinds, or other power\r\nof contract in reference thereto.\" But this does not prevent laws\r\nregulating contracts between husband and wife.\r\n\r\nIn matters of divorce and personal relation, such as the guardianship\r\nof children, the tendency has also been to put women on an equality\r\nwith men and more so. That is to say, divorces are awarded women which\r\nfor similar reasons would not be awarded men, both by statute and by\r\nusual court decision, and although a very few States, such as recently\r\ndeveloped in the conservative State of South Carolina, retain the\r\ncommon-law idea that the father must be the head of the family, many\r\nStates provide that the rights of the parents to the custody and\r\neducation of their children shall be equal. In other words they are to\r\nbe brought up by a committee of two. Nevertheless, in California and\r\nother code States of the West it is still declared that the husband is\r\nthe head of the family and may fix the place of abode, and the wife\r\nmust follow him under penalty of desertion. Such matters are more\r\noften determined by custom or by court decision on the common law than\r\nby written statute; and it is apprehended that the judges will usually\r\nfollow the more conservative rule of giving the custody of infant\r\nchildren to the mother, and of more mature children, particularly the\r\nboys, to the father.\r\n\r\nDivorce statistics on the subject are extremely misleading for two\r\ngreat reasons: First, because in the nature of the case, and perhaps\r\nof the American character, in two cases out of three a divorce is\r\ngranted for fault of the husband.[1] And in the second place, because\r\na false cause is given in a great majority of cases. In England until\r\nrecently the rule was absolute that a woman could not get a divorce\r\nfor adultery alone, but there had to be cruelty besides; while the man\r\ncould be divorced for the first-named cause. No such rule has ever\r\nprevailed in any State of this country. Desertion and failure to\r\nsupport, on the other hand, are much more easily proved by the wife.\r\nIn short, it is not too much to say that in all matters of divorce she\r\nstands in a position of advantage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _U.S. Labor Bulletin_, Special Reports on Divorce, 1860,\r\n1908.]\r\n\r\nThe same thing is in practice true as to marriage. Under liberal\r\nnotions, prevailing until recently in all our States, certainly in all\r\nwhere the so-called common-law marriage prevails, it is extremely easy\r\nfor a woman to prove herself the lawful wife of any man she could\r\nprove herself to have known, and sometimes even without proving the\r\nacquaintance. The \"common-law\" marriage, by the way, is not, so far as\r\nI can determine, the English common law, nor ever was. If any common\r\nlaw at all, it is the Scotch common law, the English law always having\r\nrequired a ceremony by some priest or at least some magistrate, as\r\ndoes still the law of New England. Under the influence of the State\r\nCommissioners for Uniformity of Law this matter has been amended in\r\nthe State of New York, so that if there be no ceremony there must at\r\nleast be some written evidence of contract, as in the case of a sale\r\nof goods and chattels under the statute of frauds; the contract of\r\nmarriage being thus, for the first time in New York, made of equal\r\nimportance with that of the sale of goods to the value of one hundred\r\ndollars. Much difference of opinion exists between the South and the\r\nNorth upon this point, the Southern view being more remarkable for\r\nchivalry, and the Northern for good sense. Southern members of the\r\nNational Conference of Commissioners claimed that any such law would\r\nresult in disaster to many young girls; that if they had to travel\r\nten, twenty, or thirty miles to find a minister or justice of the\r\npeace they would in many cases dispense with the formality or be\r\nimpatient of the delay; and that anyhow on general principles any\r\nunmarried man who had seen an unmarried young woman two or three times\r\nought to be engaged to her if he was not. The Northern Commissioners,\r\non the other hand, were desirous of protecting the man, and especially\r\nhis legitimate widow and children, from the female adventuress, which\r\nview the South again characterized as cynical. There is probably\r\nsomething to be said for both sides.\r\n\r\nComing finally to political rights, the subject of women's suffrage\r\nalone might well be reserved for a separate chapter, if, indeed, it is\r\nto be disposed of by any one mind; but at least the actual occurrences\r\nmay be stated. As mentioned above in our chapter on political rights,\r\nit now exists, by the constitutions of four States; and has been\r\nsubmitted by constitutional amendment in several others and refused.\r\nNo actual progress, therefore, has been made in fifteen years. As to\r\noffice-holding, the constitutions of Missouri and Oklahoma--one most\r\nconservative, the other most radical--both specify that the governor\r\nand members of the legislature must be male. In South Dakota women may\r\nhold any office except as otherwise provided by the constitution. In\r\nVirginia, by the constitution, they may be notaries public. In all\r\nother States, save the four women's-suffrage States, the common law\r\nprevails, and they may not hold political office. The first entirely\r\nfemale jury was empanelled in Colorado this year (1910). In some\r\nStates, however, statutes have been passed opening certain offices,\r\nsuch as notaries public, and, of course, the school commission. Such\r\nstatutes are, in the writer's opinion, illogical; if women, under\r\na silent constitution, can hold office by statute, they can do it\r\nwithout. It is or is not a constitutional right which the legislature,\r\nat least, has no power to give or withhold.\r\n\r\nGenerally in matters of education they have the same rights both to\r\nteach and be taught as males. Indeed, Idaho, Washington, and Wyoming\r\ndeclare that the people have a right to education \"without distinction\r\nof race, color, caste, or sex,\" and that is practically the case by\r\nthe common law of all States, though there is nothing to prevent\r\neither coeducation or segregation in schools. The recent tendency of\r\ncustom is certainly in the latter direction, Tufts, Wesleyan, and\r\nother Eastern colleges having given up coeducation after trial, and\r\nthe principle having been attacked in Chicago, Michigan, and other\r\nuniversities, and by many writers both of fact and fiction.\r\n\r\nThese are the abstract statements, but one or two matters deserve more\r\nparticular treatment. First of all, divorce legislation. Many years\r\nago the State Commissioners for Uniformity of Law voted to adhere to\r\nthe policy of reforming divorce procedure while not attacking the\r\ncauses. This, again, is too vast a subject to more than summarize\r\nhere. The causes of divorce vary and have varied all the way from no\r\ndivorce for any cause in South Carolina, for only one cause in New\r\nYork and other States, up to twenty or thirty causes, with that\r\nindefinite or \"omnibus\" clause of \"mutual incompatibility,\" or\r\nallowing the courts to grant divorces in the interest of the\r\ngeneral peace. Since the efforts of reformers have wiped out the\r\nexpress-omnibus clause from the legislation of all States, the same\r\nabuse has crept in under the guise of \"cruelty\"; the national divorce\r\nreport before referred to showing that the courts of this broad land\r\nhave held sufficient cruelty to justify divorce (to the wife at least)\r\nto exist in tens of thousands of different incidents or causes,\r\nranging all the way from attempts to murder (\"breaking plaintiff's\r\nnose, fingers, two of her ribs, cut her face and lip, chewed and\r\nbitten her ears and face, and wounded her generally from head to\r\nfoot\") to not cutting his toenails [1] or refusing to take the wife to\r\ndrive in a buggy; indeed, one young North Carolina woman got a divorce\r\nfrom a man she had recently married, on the ground that he was\r\npossessed of great wealth, but she had been assured that he was an\r\ninvalid, and had married him in the hope and belief of his speedy\r\ndecease, instead of which he proceeded to get cured, which caused her\r\ngreat mental anguish; while one husband at least got a divorce for a\r\nmissing vest button.[2] But, independent of the vagaries of courts and\r\njudges, and perhaps, most of all, of juries in such matters, it has\r\nbeen found that the numbers of divorces bear no particular relation to\r\nthe number of causes. In fact, many clergymen argue that to have only\r\none cause, adultery, is the worst law of all, as it drives the parties\r\nto commit this sin when otherwise they might attain the desired\r\ndivorce by simple desertion. Moreover, the difference in condition,\r\neducation, religion, race, and climate is so great throughout the\r\nUnion that it is unwise, as well as impossible, to get all of our\r\nforty-eight States to take the same view on this subject, the Spanish\r\nCatholic as the Maine free-thinker, the settler in wild and lonely\r\nregions as the inhabitant of the old New England town over-populated\r\nby spinsters. It was, therefore, the opinion of the State\r\nCommissioners that the matter of causes was best determined by States,\r\naccording to their local conditions, and that it would be unwise to\r\nattempt, even by amendment to the Constitution, to enforce a national\r\nuniformity. All the abuses, substantially, in divorce matters come\r\nfrom procedure, from the carelessness of judges and juries, or, most\r\nof all, by laws permitting divorce without proper term of residence,\r\nwithout proper notice to the other side, or by collusion, without\r\nproper defence, or for no reason but the obvious intention of\r\ncontracting other marriages. The recommendations of the Commissioners\r\non Uniformity will, therefore, be found summarized below,[3] and there\r\nis beginning to be legislation in the direction of adopting these, or\r\nsimilar statutes. The Supreme Court has vindicated, however, the right\r\nof the State not to be compelled under the full faith and credit\r\nclause to give effect to divorces improperly obtained in other States\r\nby its own citizens or against a defendant who is a citizen. In other\r\nwords, a marriage, lawful where made, is good everywhere; not so of\r\na divorce. The fact that this ruling, wise and proper, necessarily\r\nresults in the possibility that a person may be married in one State,\r\ndivorced in another, and a bachelor in a third, and bigamous in a\r\nfourth, lends but an added variety to American life. If the people\r\nwish to give the Federal government power to make nationwide marriage\r\nand divorce laws, they must do so by constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Sic_: \"U.S. Labor Commissioners' Report on Marriage and\r\nDivorce,\" Revised Edition, 1889, pp. 174, 175, 176.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Ibid_., p. 177.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: AN ACT TO ESTABLISH A LAW UNIFORM WITH THE LAW OF OTHER\r\nSTATES RELATIVE TO MIGRATORY DIVORCE\r\n\r\nSection 1.

All acts and parts of acts inconsistent herewith are hereby\r\nrepealed.]\r\n\r\nIt is always to be remembered that the law of marriage, and divorce\r\nas well, was originally administered by the church. Marriage was a\r\n_sacrament_; it brought about a _status_; it was not a mere secular\r\ncontract, as is growing to be more and more the modern view. Indeed,\r\nthe whole matter of sexual relations was left to the church, and was\r\nconsequently matter of sin and virtue, not of crime and innocence.\r\nModern legislation has, perhaps, too far departed from this\r\ndistinction. Unquestionably, many matters of which the State now takes\r\njurisdiction were better left to the conscience and to the church, so\r\nlong as they offend no third party nor the public. Very few lawyers\r\ndoubt that most of the causes of action based on them, such as the\r\nfamiliar one for alienation of the affections, are only of use to the\r\nblackmailer and the adventurer. They are very seldom availed of by\r\nhonest women.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is not questionable that modern American legislation,\r\nparticularly in the code States, in California, New York, and the West\r\ngenerally, is based upon the view that marriage is a simple contract,\r\nwhence results the obvious corollary that it may be dissolved at any\r\ntime by mutual consent. No State has thus far followed the decision\r\nto this logical end, on the pretended assumption that the rights of\r\nchildren are concerned; but the rights of children might as well\r\nbe conserved upon a voluntary divorce as after a scandalous court\r\nproceeding. One possible view is that the church should set its own\r\nstandard, and the state its own standard, even to the extreme of not\r\nregulating the matter at all except by ordinary laws of contract and\r\nlaws for the record of marriages and divorces and for the custody,\r\nguardianship, support, and education of children, which would include\r\nthe presumption of paternity pending an undissolved marriage, but all\r\ndivorces to be by mutual consent. It is evident to any careful student\r\nof our legislation that we would be rapidly approaching this view\r\nbut for the conservative influence of Massachusetts, Connecticut,\r\nPennsylvania, New Jersey, and the South, and but for the efforts of\r\nmost of the churches and the divorce reform societies. Which influence\r\nwill prove more powerful in the end it is not possible to predict.\r\n\r\nSocialists urge that the institution of marriage is bound up with that\r\nof private property. There is little doubt that the women's suffrage\r\nmovement tends to socialism, and, also, paradoxical as it may at first\r\nseem, to lax marriage laws and easy divorces. \"The single standard\r\nof morality\" offered by all advanced women's-rights advocates will\r\nnecessarily be a levelling down, not a levelling up; and in a society\r\nwhere the life of the ordinary young woman _is_ that which at least\r\n_was_ that of the ordinary young man about town, it is hardly likely\r\nthat there will be any stricter legislation. Where a majority of young\r\nwomen live alone and earn their living, the old order must change.\r\n\r\nDivorce, it should be known, is a modern institution; that is, divorce\r\nby the secular courts. Such divorce as the Roman Church recognized, or\r\nwas granted by act of Parliament, was the only divorce existing down\r\nto the year 1642, when one Hannah Huish was divorced in Connecticut by\r\nthe General Court, \"with liberty to marry again as God may grant her\r\nopportunity,\" and about that time the Colony of Massachusetts Bay\r\nenacted the first law (with the possible exception of one in Geneva)\r\npermitting divorces by ordinary courts of law.\r\n\r\nThe age of consent means two things, or even three, which leads to\r\nmuch confusion. It has a definite meaning in the criminal law, to be\r\ndiscussed later; and then it has a double meaning in the marriage law.\r\nFirst, the age under which the marriage of a girl or boy is absolutely\r\nvoid; second, the age at which it is lawful without the consent of the\r\nparents. The tendency of our legislation is to raise the latter age\r\nand possibly the former. At least, marriages of very young persons may\r\nbe absolutely cancelled as if they had never taken place. According to\r\nall precedents, human and divine, from the Garden of Eden to Romeo and\r\nJuliet, \"the age of consent\" would by common sense appear to be the\r\nage at which the woman did in fact consent; such is the common law,\r\nbut such is not usually law by our statutes.\r\n\r\nBut perhaps the legislation of the future is best represented by the\r\nextraordinary effort, whose beginning we now see, to prevent\r\nfreedom of marriage Itself. There is probably no human liberty, no\r\nconstitutional right to property, or hardly, even, to one's personal\r\nfreedom, which has been more ardently asserted by all persons not\r\nactually slaves (and even, indeed, by them) than the right to love and\r\nmarry. In the rare instances where even priests have interfered, it\r\nhas usually led to resentment or resistance. The common law has never\r\ndared to.[1] Marriages between near relations, prohibited by the\r\nMosaic law, were invalid by the church law, and became invalid by\r\nthe secular law at the very late period when it began to have any\r\njurisdiction over the matter, hardly in England half a century ago; in\r\nthe United States, where we have never had canon law or church courts,\r\nthe secular law took the Mosaic law from the time of the Massachusetts\r\nBody of Liberties (1641). The first interference of statute was\r\nthe prohibition of the marriage of first cousins. This seems to be\r\nincreasing. The prohibition of marriage between different races we\r\nhave mentioned in another chapter. To-day we witness the startling\r\ntendency for the States to prescribe whom a person shall _not_ marry,\r\neven if it do not prescribe whom they shall. The science of eugenics,\r\nnew-fangled as the word itself, will place upon the statute-book\r\nmatters and considerations which our forefathers left to the Lord.\r\nConsiderable progress has already been made in this country. The\r\nmarriage of insane persons, persons absolutely _non compos_, was, of\r\ncourse, always void at the common law, and the church law as well.\r\nThey are incapable of contract. The marriage of impotent persons was\r\nvoid also, but by recent laws the marriage of epileptics is forbidden\r\nand made void, the marriage of persons addicted to intoxicating\r\nliquors or drugs, the marriage of persons who have been infected by\r\ncertain diseases; and finally, most startling of all, the proposal\r\nlooms in the future to make every man contemplating a marriage submit\r\nhimself to an examination, both moral and physical, by the State or\r\ncity officials as to his health and habits, and even that of his\r\nancestry, as bearing upon his posterity. Novels have been written\r\nabout men who avoided marriage by reason of a taint of insanity in the\r\nfamily; this modern science of eugenics would propose to make such\r\nconduct compulsory by law.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Mr. Flinders Petrie, in his late book, \"Janus in Modern\r\nLife,\" tells us that at least ten varieties of marriage and marriage\r\nlaw have prevailed in history, and that all save marriage by capture\r\nperdure in the civilized world to-day, most of them, in actuality,\r\neven in England.]\r\n\r\nWe have now said enough on the abstract questions to close with some\r\nof the concrete examples. Some States forbid the marriage of a person\r\nwho has tuberculosis; some require him to submit to an examination. In\r\n1907 a bill was introduced in Michigan, which provided that no person\r\nshould be permitted to marry who had ever led an unchaste life. This\r\nbill did not, however, become a law.\r\n\r\nIn divorce matters New York, in 1890, adopted the very intelligent\r\nstatute requiring courts to allow a person charged as corespondent in\r\na divorce case to make defence. Six States raised the age of consent\r\nin criminal matters, and four in marriage; one required a marriage\r\nceremony. In 1891 one State added crime, or conviction for crime, as\r\na cause of divorce, one insanity. Two regulated the procedure in the\r\ndirection recommended by the Uniformity Commissioners. One made it\r\ncriminal to advertise the securing of divorces in the newspapers. Two\r\nStates made simple sexual connection a crime (which was not a crime\r\nat the common law). One Southern State enacted a special law against\r\nslander of women,--another instance of the tendency to their special\r\nprotection. Several States adopted newer laws giving complete control\r\nof their separate property to women, and allowing them to do business\r\nas sole traders, without responsibility for the husband's debts. Two\r\nmore States passed statutes allowing women to practise law. In 1890\r\none other State forbids drinks to be served by either women or\r\nchildren under eighteen.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 there was much legislation concerning the powers of the mother\r\nover the children, and the liability of the husband to support both\r\nwife and children under penalty as for the crime of desertion. This\r\nlegislation has now become pretty general throughout the country; that\r\nis, it is made a criminal offence for a man to desert his wife or\r\nchildren, or, being able, to fail to support them. One State declared\r\nthe husband and wife joint guardians of the children. In 1894 one\r\nState prohibited marriage between first cousins, and one between uncle\r\nand niece. One declared that marriage removed nonage. One made it a\r\nmisdemeanor for a married man to make an offer of marriage. The laws\r\nfor support of wife and children continue, and there were laws passed\r\ngiving alimony to the wife, even in case the divorce were for her\r\nfault. One State made both husband and wife competent witnesses\r\nagainst each other in either civil or criminal cases. One found it\r\nnecessary to declare that a woman might practise medicine, and another\r\nthat she might be a guardian; the statute in both cases would seem to\r\nhave been unnecessary. Two States provided that she might not serve\r\nliquor in saloons or restaurants, the statute already referred\r\nto. Louisiana adopted the intelligent statute, already mentioned,\r\npermitting the right of suffrage to women in cases of votes on loans\r\nor taxes by cities, counties, or towns; and Utah first enacted the\r\nmuch-mooted statute that female school-teachers should be paid like\r\nwages as males for the same services. It would be most interesting\r\nto hear how this statute, which was passed in 1896, turned out to\r\nwork.[1] One State provided that women might be masters in chancery,\r\nand another carried out the idea of equality by enacting that women\r\nshould no longer be excepted in the laws against tramps and vagrants.\r\nConstitutional amendments proposing women's suffrage were defeated\r\nthis year (1895) in no less than nine States. Connecticut passed a law\r\nthat no man or woman should marry who was epileptic or imbecile, if\r\nthe wife be under forty-five, and another State for the first time\r\nawards divorce to the husband for cruelty or indignities suffered at\r\nthe hands of the wife, while another State still repeals altogether\r\nits law permitting divorces for cruelty or intoxication. One other\r\nmakes insanity a cause of divorce. One other, non-support. Two or\r\nthree adopt the notion of joint guardianship of children.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A State official informs me that the law is evaded, see\r\nabove, p. 212.]\r\n\r\nIn 1897 one State prohibits the remarriage of divorced parties\r\nduring the life of the innocent plaintiff; the Uniformity of Law\r\nCommissioners came to the conclusion that any limitation upon\r\nremarriage was unwise and led both to immorality and to wrong against\r\ninnocent third persons. Divorces should either not be granted at all,\r\nor be granted absolutely. This is the better opinion; though, of\r\ncourse, it does not apply to mere orders of separation. Much confusion\r\nof thought has arisen upon this subject, the upholders of lax divorces\r\nalways assuming that the opponents mean to compel persons to live\r\ntogether in misery or incompatibility, which, of course, is far from\r\nthe case. A legal separation has always been permitted, except,\r\nindeed, where that doctrine is interfered with by modern statute; any\r\nwife can be freed of a vicious or cruel husband and even compel him to\r\nsupport her while living away from him, but \"platform women\" are apt\r\nto forget this fact. In the same year one Southern State has the\r\nchivalry to provide that no women should be worked as convicts on the\r\nroad; one is not aware but for this that it ever happened. We see\r\nmore humane legislation about this time for the protection and proper\r\ntreatment of women in jails or houses of detention, for the services\r\nof matrons and the careful separation of the sexes, and by now seats\r\nfor women in stores or factories are almost universally required. The\r\nsale of liquor to women is in one State specially forbidden, Louisiana\r\nfollows the Texas law giving women tax-payers a vote on appropriations\r\nfor permanent improvements.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 comes the law of Michigan, already referred to, forbidding\r\npersons with contagious diseases to marry, and compelling physicians\r\nto testify. The Massachusetts Medical Association has gone on record\r\nas urging that there should be a privilege to physicians in all cases,\r\nas there is to lawyers. Many people believe that to be the common law;\r\nsuch is not the case, even as to priests.\r\n\r\nOne more State this year awards divorce for insanity, and one more\r\nfor intoxication. Several States permit women to get damages from\r\nliquor-sellers selling intoxicating drink to their husbands; I know\r\nof no corresponding statute permitting the husband to get damages\r\nfor drinks sold the wife. A wife may testify against the husband in\r\ncertain cases, as actions for alienating of affection, or criminal\r\nconversation; not so the husband. Texas and other Southwestern States\r\nadopt the statute that an action for seduction shall be suspended on\r\nthe defendant's marriage with the plaintiff, otherwise it is a felony,\r\nand it is again a felony should he after such marriage desert her--the\r\nFourteenth Amendment to the contrary notwithstanding (which reminds\r\none of the colonial Massachusetts statute, that the punishment for\r\nthat offence may either be imprisonment in the state-prison, or\r\nmarriage!).\r\n\r\nThe laws aimed at mere sin increase in number. One State makes\r\nimproper relations, even by mutual consent, punishable with four years\r\nin the state-prison, if the girl be under eighteen. North Dakota\r\nintroduces a bill to require medical examination in all cases as a\r\nprerequisite to marriage; it failed in North Dakota that year, but was\r\npromptly introduced in other States. In Oregon all widows and fathers\r\nmay vote, without regard to property qualification, in school district\r\nelections; and this State joins the number of those which forbid the\r\nmarriage of first cousins.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 came the great New York statute abolishing the common-law\r\nmarriage, which we have discussed above. Some States pass laws\r\npunishing wife-beating by either imprisonment or a whipping. In 1902\r\nperhaps the most interesting thing is that there is no legislation\r\nwhatever of any kind on the subject of women's suffrage--showing\r\ndistinctly the refluent wave. In 1903 New Hampshire rejects a\r\nconstitutional amendment for women's suffrage. Kansas restricts the\r\nmarriage of epileptic and weak-minded persons. Several States reform\r\ntheir divorce laws, and Pennsylvania adopts Southern ideas giving\r\ndivorce for a previous unchastity discovered after marriage. This\r\nmatter has so far been covered by no Northern State, though it had\r\nbeen law from all time in Virginia.\r\n\r\nIn 1904 women's suffrage was proposed in Oregon, and in 1905 rejected.\r\nIllinois follows New York in abolishing the common-law marriage, and\r\nraises the age to eighteen in a woman and twenty-one in a man. As is\r\noften the case, it does not appear from the ambiguous wording of the\r\nstatute whether this invalidates the marriage or merely subjects the\r\noffenders, or the minister or the magistrate, to a penalty; probably\r\nthe latter. Minnesota forbids the marriage of imbecile or epileptic\r\npersons; Nebraska that of first cousins, and Pennsylvania adopts the\r\nuniform divorce law recommended by the commissioners. Five other\r\nStates reform their divorce laws, and four their laws concerning\r\nmarried women's property, and seventeen adopt new laws for compulsory\r\nsupport of the woman and children by the husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1906 one more State adopts the idea of giving a vote to female\r\nproperty-owners in money elections. One puts the age of consent up\r\nto sixteen. In a good many States it is already eighteen. Women's\r\nsuffrage is again rejected in Oregon; and finally even South Dakota\r\nreforms her divorce laws.\r\n\r\nPerhaps a word should be given to other laws relating to minors as\r\nwell as to young women. There is very general legislation throughout\r\nthe country forbidding the sale of intoxicating liquor to persons\r\nunder twenty-one, and in the great majority of the States the sale\r\nof cigarettes, narcotics or other drugs, or even tobacco, to persons\r\nunder twenty-one, eighteen, or fifteen, respectively. In some States\r\nit is forbidden, or made a misdemeanor, to insure the lives of\r\nchildren--very important legislation, if necessary. In 1904 Virginia\r\npassed a statute punishing kidnapping with death, which is followed in\r\n1905 by heavy penalties for abduction in three other States; fourteen\r\nStates establish juvenile courts. Seven States make voluntary\r\ncohabitation a crime, and six pass what are known as curfew laws.\r\nIndeed, it may be generally said that the tendency is, either by State\r\nstatute or municipal ordinance, to forbid children, or at least girls\r\nunder sixteen, from being unattended on the streets of a city after a\r\ncertain hour in the evening.\r\n\r\nIn 1907 Mississippi makes the age of consent twelve, and the penalty\r\nfor rape death, which, indeed, is the common law, but which law has\r\nextraordinary consequences when the age is raised, as it is in many\r\nStates, to eighteen. Two more States adopt the laws against abduction\r\nand one a statute against blackmail.\r\n\r\nSufficient has, perhaps, been said to give the reader a general view\r\nof contemporary law-making on this most important matter of personal\r\nrelations. Most of the matters mentioned in this chapter are cohered\r\nby various learned societies in annual reports, or even by the\r\ngovernment, in cases of marriage and divorce, and to such special\r\ntreatises the reader may be referred for more precise information. The\r\nSpecial Report of the United States Census Office, 1909, published\r\nearly in 1910, makes a careful and elaborate study of the whole\r\nquestion from the years 1867 to 1906. Such statistics are necessarily\r\nuncertain for reasons already indicated. Court judgments do not\r\nindicate the true cause of divorce, nor is the complainant necessarily\r\nthe innocent party, nor are the numbers of divorces granted, as for\r\ninstance in Nevada, any fair indication of the normal divorce rate of\r\nthe people really living in that State. With this caution we will note\r\nthat the number of divorces varied from about five hundred in each\r\nhundred thousand of married population every year in Washington,\r\nMontana, Colorado, Arkansas, Texas, Oregon, Wyoming, Indiana, Idaho,\r\nand Oklahoma, down to less than fifty, or about one-tenth as many, in\r\nNew Jersey, New York, and Delaware. Certain significant observations\r\nmay certainly be made upon this table. In the first place, the\r\nolder States, the old thirteen, have, from the point of view of the\r\nconservative or divorce reformer, the best record. At the head\r\nstand the three States just named, then North Carolina, Georgia,\r\nPennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, Massachusetts, Louisiana (largely\r\nFrench and Roman Catholic), and Connecticut--ten of the original\r\nthirteen States. Only New Hampshire and Rhode Island, the latter for\r\nobvious reasons, stand low down in the column; the last State having\r\nabout three hundred divorces as against Montana's five hundred. South\r\nCarolina, having no divorces at all, does not appear.\r\n\r\nThe next observation one is compelled to make is that divorces are\r\nmost numerous in the women's suffrage States, or in the States\r\nneighboring, where \"women's rights\" notions are most prevalent.\r\nMontana, Colorado, Wyoming, and Idaho stand second, third, sixth, and\r\neighth, respectively, among the fifty States and Territories comprised\r\nin the table.[1] On succeeding pages are graphic maps showing the\r\nconditions which in this particular prevail for a number of years.\r\nThere is little change of these in the thirty years from 1870 to 1900.\r\nThe Atlantic seaboard and Southern States in 1870 are left white, with\r\nthe exception of New England, which is slightly shaded; that is,\r\nthey have less than twenty-five divorces per hundred thousand of\r\ninhabitants. In 1880 the black belt States and Territories--having one\r\nhundred and over--extends from Wyoming over Montana, Colorado, Utah,\r\nand Nevada. In 1900 it covers the entire far West and Southwest, with\r\nthe exception of New Mexico (Roman Catholic) and Utah (Mormon). The\r\nchart showing the relation of divorces to number of married population\r\ndoes not materially differ. Now these figures, ranging from five\r\nhundred divorces per hundred thousand married population per year, or\r\nthree hundred in the more lax States, down to less than fifty in the\r\nstricter States, compare with other countries as follows:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Census Reports, 1909, \"Marriage and Divorce,\" part I, p.\r\n15.]\r\n\r\nOnly Japan shows a number of divorces approaching these figures.\r\nShe has two hundred and fifteen per one hundred thousand of general\r\npopulation,--about the same as Indiana, which stands eighth in the\r\norder of States. But with the exception of Japan no civilized country\r\nshows anything like the proportion of divorces that the American\r\nStates do. Thus, in Great Britain and Ireland there are but two per\r\nhundred thousand of population; in Scotland, four; in the German\r\nEmpire, fifteen; in France, twenty-three, and in the highest country\r\nof all, Switzerland, thirty-two, while the average of the entire\r\nUnited States is seventy-three.\r\n\r\nThe census figures as to the trades or professions in which divorce\r\nis most prevalent are amusing, but probably not very significant. It\r\nappears, as might be expected, that actors and actresses stand at the\r\nhead, and next musicians or teachers of music; while clergymen stand\r\nvery near the bottom of the list, only excelled in this good record\r\nby bar-tenders (in Rhode Island) and, throughout the country, by\r\nagricultural laborers.\r\n\r\nBut after all, more important, perhaps, than even marriage and\r\ndivorce, are the great social changes which arise from the general\r\nengaging of women in industrial occupation. In matters of property\r\nright we have found they are substantially already on an equality\r\nwith men, if not in a position of special privilege. Yet, as Herbert\r\nSpencer remarked, \"When an abuse which has existed for many centuries\r\nis at last on the point of disappearing, the most violent outcry\r\nis made against it.\" During the century when women were really\r\noppressed,[1] under the power of the husband, given no rights as to\r\ntheir property, their children, or hardly even as to their person,\r\nno complaint was heard. Whereas to-day the cry of unjust legislation\r\nalmost rises to a shriek. The movement for the emancipation of women\r\noriginated, of course, with Mary Wolstonecraft, about 1812. Her book,\r\nwhich was the first, is certainly one of the longest that have yet\r\nbeen written on the subject. It remained at the time unanswered, and\r\nwhen its author married Godwin she herself seems to have lost interest\r\nin the controversy. Nevertheless, little has been added since to the\r\nideas there put forward, save, indeed, for the vote. It is a somewhat\r\ncurious fact that in all Miss Wolstonecraft's great magazine of\r\ngrievances and demands for remedying legislation, there is not a\r\nsingle word said about votes by women, or there being such a thing as\r\nthe right to the ballot.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the trial of Mary Heelers for bigamy (2 State Trials,\r\n498) as late as 1663 the chief justice said, 'If guilty, she must die;\r\na woman hath no clergy.' Yet Mary wrote to her husband, in court,\r\n\"Nay, my lord, 'tis not amiss, before we part, to have a kiss!\" She\r\nwas acquitted.]\r\n\r\nThe industrial condition of the sex in American cities may be summed\r\nup with the general phrase \"absolute equality of opportunity,\" with\r\na certain amount of special protection. Women are nearly universally\r\nrequired to be given seats in factories and stores, and the laws\r\nspecially protecting their periods of employment have just been\r\nsustained as constitutional in the States of Illinois and Oregon and\r\nthe Supreme Court of the United States. On the other hand, we are far\r\nbehind European countries in legislation to protect their health or\r\nsanitary conditions. The most radical effort at legislation ever made\r\nwas undoubtedly that Connecticut bill forbidding employment of married\r\nwomen in factories, which, however, did not become a law. The\r\nrecent reports of Laura Scott to the American Association for Labor\r\nLegislation, on Child Labor, 1910, and the Employment of Women, 1909,\r\nhave already been referred to. From the former, which appeared as we\r\nare going to press, we learn that there are prohibited occupations\r\nto children in all the States without exception--a statement which\r\ncertainly would not have been true some years since. These prohibited\r\ngroups of employment are generally, to male and female, dangerous\r\nmachinery and mines, and to females also saloons; and there is nearly\r\nuniversally a limitation of all labor to above the age of twelve\r\nor fourteen for all purposes, and to above fourteen or sixteen\r\nfor educational purposes, besides which there is a very general\r\nprohibition of acrobatic or theatrical performances. Girls are\r\nsometimes forbidden to sell newspapers or deliver messages for\r\ntelegraph companies or others. Compulsory education is, of course,\r\nuniversal, and the machinery to bring it about is generally based upon\r\na system of certificates or cards, with truant officers and factory\r\ninspectors.\r\n\r\nAccording to the encyclopaedias, some five hundred thousand women\r\nwere employed in England about twenty years ago, of whom about three\r\nhundred thousand were in the textile mills. In Massachusetts alone\r\nthere were two hundred and eight thousand women employed, according to\r\nthe last State census. Neither of these figures include the vast class\r\nof domestic service and farm labor. The inclusion of this would swell\r\nthe proportion of adult women employed in gainful occupations to at\r\nleast one in four, if not one in three. Congress itself has recently\r\nbeen investigating the question whether \"home life has been\r\nthreatened, marriage decreased, divorce increased out of all\r\nproportion, and the birth rate now barely exceeds the death rate, so\r\nthat the economic and social welfare of the country is menaced by this\r\narmy of female wage earners\" (see _Boston Herald_, April 2, 1908). It\r\nappeared that in 1900 one million seven hundred and fifty thousand\r\nchildren were at work between the ages of ten and fifteen, of whom\r\nfive hundred thousand were girls. This and other considerations have\r\nled to the movement for national child-labor laws already discussed.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most dangerous tendency, at least to conservative ideas,\r\nis the increasing one to take the children away from the custody\r\nof the parents, or even of the mother, and place them in State\r\ninstitutions. Indeed, in some Western States it would appear that the\r\ngeneral disapproval of the neighbors of the method employed by parents\r\nin bringing up, nurturing, educating, or controlling their children,\r\nis sufficient cause for the State authorities to step in and disrupt\r\nthe family by removing the children, even when themselves unwilling,\r\nfrom the home to some State or county institution. Any one who has\r\nworked much in public charities and had experience with that woeful\r\ncreature, the institutionalized child, will realize the menace\r\ncontained in such legislation.\r\n\r\nFinally, it should be remembered that throughout the United States\r\nmen are universally liable for their wives' debts, short of some\r\nquasi-legal separation; on the other hand, wives are never liable for\r\nthe debts of their husbands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII\r\n\r\nCRIMINAL LAW AND POLICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no very general tendency toward new legislation in matters of\r\nfelony, and many States are still content to remain with the common\r\nlaw. Such legislation as there is is mainly concerned with the\r\nprotection of women and children, alluded to in the last chapter. In\r\nmatters of less serious offences, of legislation creating misdemeanors\r\nor merely declaring certain acts unlawful, there are three main lines:\r\nFirst, legislation usually expressive of the common law against\r\nconspiracies of all sorts, combinations both of individuals and\r\nof capital, already fully discussed. Next, the general line of\r\nlegislation in the interest of the health of the public, such as\r\npure food and drug laws, and examination for trade or professional\r\nlicenses; and finally laws protecting the individual against himself,\r\nsuch as liquor and anti-cigarette or anti-cocaine laws. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to more than illustrate some of these matters. Then there\r\nare the laws regulating punishment for crime, laws for probation or\r\nparole, indeterminate sentences, etc., all based on the modern theory\r\nthat reform, not retribution or even prevention, is the basis of\r\npenology. Such laws have been held constitutional, even when their\r\nresult is to arbitrarily increase a man's sentence for crime on\r\naccount of his past or subsequent conduct. Finally, and most\r\nimportant, there is the legislation regulating the actual trial of\r\ncases, indictments, juries, appeals,--the law of court procedure,\r\ncivil as well as criminal, which for convenience we may consider in\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nOf the first sort of legislation, we have noted that in many States\r\nadultery, in many States simple drunkenness, in other States mere\r\nsingle acts of immorality, are made felonies. In 1892 the State laws\r\nagainst food adulteration begin, which, by 1910, have covered milk,\r\nbutter, maple sugar, and many other subjects. By the Federal pure-food\r\nlaw of 1906, applying to Interstate commerce in such articles, it\r\nbecame advisable for the States to adopt the Federal Act as a State\r\nlaw; also for the sake of uniformity a few States have had the\r\nintelligence to do so. The trades of fat-rendering and bone-boiling\r\nare made nuisances by statute.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 we note the first statutes against lynching. In 1897 local\r\noption prevails in Texas, and the blue laws of Connecticut are\r\nabolished to the extent that recreation on Sundays is no longer\r\nprohibited. Local option and anti-lynching laws continue during the\r\nnext two or three years, and by 1900 twenty-four States have pure-food\r\nlaws, which, however, are ineffective because they impose no\r\nsufficient penalty. In 1903, in consequence of the assassination of\r\nPresident McKinley, Washington and Wisconsin make the advocating\r\nanarchy a felony. Twenty-one more States pass pure-food laws, and\r\nnearly all the States have gone over to local option from State-wide\r\nprohibition, to which latter principle only three States now adhere.\r\nIn 1904 Mississippi and Virginia adopt more stringent laws against\r\nvagrancy, and 1905 is the year of active legislation on the\r\nindeterminate sentence, juvenile courts, parole and probation, with\r\ntwo more statutes against mobs and lynching. In 1907 the States are\r\nbusied with the attempt to enforce their prohibition regulations\r\nagainst the interstate commerce jurisdiction of the Federal\r\ngovernment. Solicitation of interstate orders for liquor is forbidden\r\nin Mississippi, and it is provided that shipments sent C.O.D. are\r\nnot to be moved one hundred feet or given away; also, that the mere\r\npossession of an internal revenue receipt from the United States\r\ngovernment is _prima facie_ evidence of an offence against the State\r\nlaw. Statutes of this kind led to renewed conflict between State and\r\nFederal authority. Virginia adopts the statute against giving tips or\r\nany commissions; see p. 244 above. In 1908 we find more parole and\r\nprobation laws, two prohibition and three local-option laws, and four\r\nnew pure-food statutes.\r\n\r\nComing to matters of court procedure, in 1890 one State provides that\r\nthere should never be called more than six witnesses for each side in\r\nany criminal case, which oddly reminds one of early English trials\r\nby compurgation; but is, of course, quite unconstitutional in\r\nthis country. In 1893 Connecticut adopts a statute that honorably\r\ndischarged soldiers and sailors addicted to drink are to be \"treated\"\r\nfree at the State hospital. The definition of the word \"treated\"\r\nseems ambiguous, but in any event it is a pleasing reminder of Bishop\r\nBerkeley's remark that he would \"rather see England free than England\r\nsober.\" Some States provide for a jury of eight in criminal cases\r\nand for a verdict of three-quarters in civil cases--a statute of\r\nquestionable constitutionality. Very generally throughout the twenty\r\nyears studied by us, the States have adopted stricter rules for the\r\nadmission of attorneys at law to practise at the bar.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Pennsylvania yields to the physicians and passes a statute\r\nforbidding them to disclose communications of patients, but the\r\nstatute only applies to civil cases. More States provide for verdicts\r\nby a majority of the jury. Maryland goes Pennsylvania one better in\r\nextending the professional privilege to newspaper reporters; that is\r\nto say, we find a statute that they may not be compelled to disclose\r\ntheir sources of information, an excellent statute for the yellow\r\njournal. In 1897 California abolishes capital punishment; there has\r\nbeen a general tendency in this direction, of recent years, although\r\nsome States, having tried the experiment, have returned to it again,\r\nas has the Republic of France. In 1899 the privilege from testifying\r\nis extended in one State also to trained nurses, and in others to\r\nphysicians, even in criminal cases, although they may testify with the\r\npatient's consent. The same law was adopted in Iowa in 1900, Ohio does\r\naway with the common law of libel, except the plaintiff can prove\r\nactual malice. By this year, seventeen States expressly allow women\r\nto practise law, and twenty-eight do so by implication. The Colorado\r\nstatute for a three-fourths verdict is held unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nThe regulation of the liquor traffic is, perhaps, after the labor\r\nquestion, the most universal subject of legislation in occidental\r\nnations. Experts on the matter tell us (E.L. Fanshawe, \"Liquor\r\nLegislation in the United States and Canada,\" Report to Parliament,\r\n1892) that there have hitherto been but three, or possibly four,\r\ninventions--universal or State-wide prohibition, local option,\r\nlicense, high or low, and State administration. The last was recently\r\ntried in South Carolina with more or less success. Prohibition by\r\na general law does not seem to be effective; local option, on the\r\ncontrary, does seem to be so. But the general consensus of opinion,\r\nto which Mr. Fanshawe comes, and which seems still to be held by most\r\nintelligent American publicists, is that on the whole high license\r\nworks best, and this the women themselves have just voted in Denver;\r\nnot only because it actually prohibits to a certain extent, but it\r\nregulates and polices the traffic, prevents the sale of adulterated\r\nliquor, and to a considerable extent the grosser disorders and\r\npolitical dangers that attend the bar-room. On the other hand, the\r\npower of licensing should never be granted to any political body,\r\nbut should be granted under fixed rules (determined by geographical\r\nposition and the local opposition or desire) by the local government.\r\nThese rules should not be arbitrary, and the person applying for\r\nlicense should have the right to appeal to some court.\r\n\r\nMatters of bribery and political corruption have been somewhat\r\nanticipated under Chapter 14. Suffice it here to say that the States\r\nvery generally have been adopting statutes making bribery criminal and\r\na cause of permanent disqualification from all political right, either\r\nvoting or holding office, and this applies both to the person bribing\r\nand the person receiving the bribe. Bribery by offers or promise\r\nof employment is a far more difficult matter, but this matter also\r\ncertain States have sought to regulate.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, thousands and thousands of city ordinances\r\nrelating to the criminal law, but usually to minor offences or matters\r\nof police regulation. Undoubtedly the duplication of them tends to\r\nmake us not a law-abiding community. It was the present Boston police\r\ncommissioner who complained that there were more than eleven thousand\r\nordinances in Boston, which everybody was supposed to know. We must\r\nlet the whole matter go by saying that there is a general attempt at\r\nuniversal police regulation of all the actions of life, at least\r\nsuch as are conducted outside of a man's own house. Sunday laws,\r\nSabbatarian legislation, have, of course, very largely been abandoned,\r\nexcept when restored in the interest, or supposed interest, of labor.\r\nIn the State of New York, for instance, barbers could only shave on\r\nSunday in the city of New York and the town of Saratoga; the reasons\r\nfor the exception are obvious.\r\n\r\nComing to general principles of penology, there is no doubt that of\r\nthe three possible theories, revenge, prevention, and reform of the\r\ncriminal, it is the latter that in the main prevails throughout the\r\nUnited States. An investigation was conducted some years since by\r\ncorrespondence with a vast number of judges throughout the world, and\r\nit proved that this was also their principle of imposing sentences,\r\nin the majority of cases. More radical change is found in that\r\nlegislation freeing prisoners on parole, providing indeterminate\r\nsentences, and in the creation of special courts for boys and young\r\nwomen, with special gaols and reformatories. Jury trial, of course,\r\nremains substantially unchanged from the earlier times, only that the\r\njurors are now in most States permitted to read or to have read the\r\nnewspapers, and that the government has a right of appeal when the\r\nverdict has gone for the prisoner on a point of law. This matter,\r\nupon President Roosevelt's recommendation, was embodied in an act of\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe legislation making it criminal to advocate assassination or\r\nanarchism has been adverted to when we were considering the rights of\r\naliens. In England, it is treason to imagine the death of the king.\r\nThere is no constitutional reason why it should not be treason to\r\nimagine the death of the president, or perhaps even the subversion by\r\nforce of organized society. Such laws have been passed in Washington,\r\nWisconsin, and other States.\r\n\r\nIt has, in some States, been made a capital offence to kidnap a child,\r\nand, as has been elsewhere said, the rigor of the common law is very\r\ngenerally preserved for the crime of rape. The most active effort\r\nto-day for legislation in matters quasi-criminal is that to extend\r\njury trial over cases of contempt of court, particularly when in\r\nviolation of a chancery injunction when the act itself is criminal.\r\nThe greatest need of criminal legislation is in the writer's opinion\r\nin matters of business or corporate fraud, and in revival of our older\r\nEnglish law against the extortion or regrating of middlemen, the\r\nengrossing of markets, the artificial enhancing of the prices of the\r\nnecessaries of life, and the withholding, destruction, or improper\r\npreservation of food. But most of all, as President Taft has urged,\r\ngreater speed and certainty and less technicality in court trials for\r\ncrime--a reform of our legal procedure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX\r\n\r\nOF THE GOVERNMENTAL FUNCTION, INTERNAL IMPROVEMENTS, AND THE PUBLIC\r\nDOMAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe matter of most interest in modern American legislation for\r\nmunicipal government is probably the home-rule principle. That is,\r\nstatutes permitting cities or towns, or even villages, to draw and\r\nadopt their own charters and govern themselves in their own way. The\r\ncharter thus adopted may, of course, be the old-fashioned government\r\nof mayor, aldermen, common council, etc., or it may be the newly\r\ninvented government by commission, based substantially on the theory\r\nof permanent officials chosen at infrequent intervals, and officers,\r\nin so far as possible, appointed, and not elected. The one makes for\r\nefficiency, the other for democracy. At present the American\r\npeople seem to have a craze for efficiency, even at the expense\r\nof representative government, and of principles hitherto thought\r\nconstitutional. It is impossible to tell how long it will last. It may\r\ncarry us into the extreme of personal government, national, State, and\r\nlocal, or history may repeat itself and we may return to the principle\r\nof frequent elections and direct responsibility to the voters under\r\nthe arbitrament of the courts of law. We may go on to special courts\r\n(declared odious in the Great Case of Monopolies) and administrative\r\nlaw, or be content with improved understanding of the law we already\r\nhave.\r\n\r\nThese matters are too large for us; coming down to more concrete\r\nfacts, we find that the general tendencies of legislation upon State,\r\nand particularly municipal, government are to somewhat enlarge its\r\nfunctions, but considerably to limit its expenditure. Greater distrust\r\nis shown in legislatures, municipal as well as State, and a greater\r\ntrust and power reposed in individual heads, and a much greater power\r\nintrusted to more or less permanent boards and commissions, usually\r\nnot elective, and often clothed with vast powers not expressly\r\nsubmitted to the scrutiny of courts of law. The purposes of education\r\nare somewhat extended, generally in the direction of better education,\r\nmore technical and practical and less \"classical.\"[1] Charity includes\r\na largely increased recreation for the people, State provision for\r\nmany more classes of the invalid and incompetent, specialized homes\r\nfor various sorts of infirm or inebriate, and some little charity in\r\nthe guise of bounties of seed, etc., to needy farmers, which latter,\r\nhowever, have usually been held unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Though a lady orator in Boston this year complains to\r\nan audience of labor unionists that trades schools and industrial\r\neducation tend to \"peasantize\" the poor. Peasanthood was the condition\r\nof the agricultural laborer; it was skilled labor that made him\r\nfree--neither peasant, peon, nor villein. See p. 20, above.]\r\n\r\nThus, in 1890 North Dakota limits the debt of cities to five per\r\ncent.; but permits county loans to raise seed grain for needy farmers;\r\nother States extend the principle of socialism to electric lighting,\r\ngas, natural gas, water, sewers, agricultural drainage, irrigation,\r\nturnpikes, and cemeteries. That is to say, all may be built,\r\nmaintained, or run at the municipal expense, or under municipal\r\ncontrol. In 1895 Wisconsin, North Carolina, Texas, and other States\r\ncarefully limit State, county, town, or city taxes to prescribed\r\nrates. Texas requires a two-thirds vote on the issue of municipal\r\nbonds, and fixes the debt limit at five per cent. In 1896 Missouri\r\nrejects a constitutional amendment permitting municipal gas and water\r\nsocialism on majority vote of the voters. The same year the failure\r\nof such enterprises begins to show itself in a statute of Iowa\r\nauthorizing municipal plants to be sold upon a popular vote. The\r\nsocialist town of Hamilton, Ohio, actually went into the hands of a\r\nreceiver; a similar result followed the English experiments in the\r\ntowns of Poplar and West Ham.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 many other States adopted a limit for State, city, county, or\r\ntown taxes. Indeed, it may be stated generally, without going into\r\nfurther details, that such laws are practically universal throughout\r\nthe South and West, and prevail to some extent as to cities only in\r\nNew England, and the same may be said of laws fixing a debt limit\r\nwhich States, counties, cities, or towns may not exceed. Such laws are\r\nvery generally evaded, as by leasing desired improvements of a private\r\ncompany, or (in Indiana at least) the overlapping of municipal\r\ndistricts; thus there may be (as formerly in England) city, town,\r\nschool district or poor district, each separate and not conterminous.\r\n\r\nWhile it is obvious that municipal socialism has rather decreased in\r\nthe last ten years, laws restricting the granting of franchises have\r\nbecome far more intelligent and are being generally adopted. The best\r\nexample of such legislation is probably to be found in Kansas. The\r\ngeneral principles are that no franchise can be given but for a\r\nlimited time, that it must be bought at public auction, that the\r\nearnings beyond a certain percentage on investment must revert to\r\nthe city, and that there must be a referendum to popular vote in the\r\nlocality interested. In 1899 Michigan declares the municipal ownership\r\nof street railways unconstitutional, but Nevada passes a statute\r\nfor municipal ownership of telephone lines. In 1903 the municipal\r\nownership of gas and oil wells is permitted in Kansas, and of coal\r\nor fuel yards in Maine. A law similar to the latter was declared\r\nunconstitutional by the Massachusetts Supreme Court. Missouri adopts a\r\nsweeping statute for the municipal ownership of \"any public utilities\"\r\nin cities of less than thirty thousand population. In 1904 Louisiana\r\npermits small towns to own and operate street railways. Other States\r\ncopy the Missouri statute as to municipal ownership of all or any\r\npublic utilities, and generally the principle is extended, but only in\r\na permissive way; that is to say, upon majority vote, and this seems\r\nto be the present tendency. The most striking present experiment is\r\nin Milwaukee; both Haverhill and Brockton tried socialistic city\r\ngovernment in Massachusetts, but abandoned it.\r\n\r\nCivil-service reform has very generally made progress during the past\r\ntwenty years in State and city governments, and probably the principle\r\nis now more or less recognized in a great majority of the States.\r\n\r\nComparatively little is to be said as to internal improvements.\r\nThe Michigan Constitution provides that the State shall go into no\r\ninternal improvement whatever, and this, of course, was the older\r\nprinciple without any express constitutional provision. North Dakota\r\nand Wyoming provide that the State cannot be interested in works of\r\ninternal improvement except upon two-thirds vote of the people.\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota also provides that the State may not engage in them in\r\nany case; Alabama, that it may not loan its credit in support of\r\nsuch works; and Maryland, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, that it may not\r\ncontract debts for the same, or in Kansas be a party to carrying them\r\non. In Virginia, no county, city, or town may engage in any work\r\nof internal improvement except roads. Many of the States, however,\r\nspecify a considerable number of purposes for which State, cities, or\r\ncounties may give or loan their credit; and the matter of municipal\r\nsocialism has just been discussed.\r\n\r\nVery generally, the States have created agricultural experiment\r\nstations and model farms, drainage districts in the South, a levee\r\nsystem on the Mississippi River, and irrigation districts in the West;\r\nartesian wells in Texas, and in several States, State dairy bureaus.\r\nIn specialized products, such as beet sugar, there is often provision\r\nfor a State agricultural bureau, and nearly always for general\r\nagricultural as well as industrial instruction. The States are only\r\nbeginning to adopt State forests, or forest reserves, Massachusetts\r\nand New York leading the way. Forestry commissions exist in a few\r\nStates, but the very slightest beginning has been made at forestry\r\nlaws. No control is as yet exercised over reforestation or replanting;\r\na few of the Western States exempt growing trees, or the land covered\r\nby growing trees, from more than a nominal tax, notably Indiana and\r\nNebraska. The forestry laws are, however, increasing. In 1903 we find\r\none, in 1904 five, and in 1905 six, with the tree bounty law in North\r\nDakota, and two States exempting forest lands from taxes. There are\r\nfour statutes this year for fish or game preserves. In 1907 four\r\nStates create forestry boards, and two exempt forests from taxation,\r\nand in 1908 growing trees are exempted in Massachusetts and Rhode\r\nIsland. But under the unlimited power of Congress over Federal\r\nterritory not yet incorporated into States, or not ceded to the State\r\nwhen incorporated, it is to the Federal government that we have looked\r\nfor the creation and preservation of parks, forest reserves, and\r\nnatural reserves generally. How far it may constitutionally create\r\nsuch within the lines of old States, or on land of which it is\r\notherwise incapable of ownership, is a constitutional question still\r\nundecided.\r\n\r\nThe educational functions of the State are, of course, a peculiar\r\nprinciple of American civilization. Nearly all State constitutions\r\nprovide that education is a natural right, and the first common school\r\nsupported by general taxation appears in the Colony of Massachusetts\r\nBay before the year 1640. The principle of compulsory education\r\nexists throughout all the States, and in all education of the most\r\ndiversified kind is given, from the primary school or kindergarten to\r\nthe State university or technical school of applied science, trade, or\r\nbusiness. Nearly all the States have established State universities\r\nwhich are free or open at a nominal charge. Massachusetts continues\r\nto rely upon a semi-private institution, Harvard University, which,\r\nindeed, is expressly mentioned in its constitution. Provision is\r\nuniversally made also for evening schools, for industrial schools, for\r\npublic libraries, and for popular elections, and besides the ordinary\r\neducational laws and the truant laws, there is in the statutes\r\nconcerning labor matters abundant machinery for requiring some\r\neducation as a preliminary to any employment. The age of compulsory\r\neducation may be said to average between the ages of eight and\r\nfifteen, though the limits are extended either way in the divers\r\nStates. Farm schools and industrial reform schools generally\r\nexist, both as a part of the present system and of the educational\r\ndepartment. Coeducation in State schools and colleges is almost\r\nuniversal. On the other hand, as we have shown, the segregation of\r\nthe races is in some States insisted upon. Several States forbid the\r\nemployment of teachers under the age of sixteen, or even eighteen.\r\nFree text-books are generally provided. The period of compulsory\r\nschooling varies from the classic twelve weeks in the winter, as in\r\nold New England, to substantially the full academic year. Textile and\r\nother manual training schools exist in some States, but have generally\r\nevoked the opposition of organized labor, and are more usually\r\ncreated by private endowment. The tendency of civil service reform\r\nlegislation, furthermore, has been to require a certain minimum of\r\neducation, though it may be feared that the forecast of De Tocqueville\r\nremains justified; our national educational weakness is our failure to\r\nprovide for a \"serious higher instruction.\"\r\n\r\nThe great question of taxation we may only mention here by way of\r\nexclusion. It is naturally a matter for treatment by itself. The\r\nreader will remember (see chapter VII) that nearly all the States have\r\nnow inheritance taxes besides direct property taxes, and many of them\r\nhave income taxes and, in the South particularly, license taxes, or\r\ntaxes upon trades or callings. They all tax corporations, nearly\r\nalways by an excise tax on the franchise or stock, distinct from the\r\nproperty tax or the tax upon earnings. In both corporation taxes and\r\ninheritance taxes they are likely to find themselves in conflict with\r\nthe Federal government, or at least to have duplicate systems taxing\r\nthe same subjects, as, indeed, already considerable injustice is\r\ncaused by inheritance taxes imposed in full in each State upon the\r\nstock of corporations lying in more than one State. In such cases the\r\ntax should, of course, be proportionate.\r\n\r\nThe principle of graded taxation in the matter of incomes and\r\nsuccession taxes has been very generally adopted, not as yet in any\r\ndirect property tax, except that a small amount of property, one\r\nhundred dollars or five hundred dollars, is usually exempt.\r\n\r\nThe principle of imposing taxation not for revenue, but for some\r\nulterior or ethical purpose, such as the destruction of swollen\r\nfortunes, is liable to constitutional objection in this country,\r\nthough the courts may not look behind the tax to the motive, unless\r\nthe latter is expressed upon the face. For this reason, the present\r\ncorporation tax, on its surface, is imposed solely for the purpose of\r\nraising revenue, though in debate in Congress it was advocated\r\nmainly for the object of bringing large corporations under Federal\r\nexamination and control.\r\n\r\nThe last matter relating to taxation, that of bounties, we have\r\ndiscussed in chapter VII also. State aid bonds, or bonds of counties,\r\ncities, and towns, issued to encourage industries, raise a question\r\nfar more complex than the simple bounty. Such legislation has,\r\nhowever, practically ceased throughout the country, except in the form\r\nof exemption from taxation. It has been recognized by a long line of\r\ndecisions that it is constitutional to grant such aid to railroads,\r\nbut it may be questioned in almost any other industry. A mere\r\nexemption from taxation, especially for a certain number of years,\r\nrests on a stronger constitutional basis. Many of the Southern States\r\nhave recently passed laws exempting manufacturing corporations, etc.,\r\nfrom taxation for a definite number of years, and such provisions are\r\nfound in one or two State constitutions. When they only rest upon a\r\nstatute, however, they are always at least litigable at the suit of\r\nany tax-payer. So, bonds issued by the city of Boston under a statute\r\nexpressly authorizing them to enable land-owners to rebuild after the\r\ngreat fire, were held to be void. A Federal loan was proposed to raise\r\nmoney to lend to the inhabitants of San Francisco to rebuild after the\r\nearthquake, but failed of enactment. It will be remembered that the\r\nStates have very generally no power to engage in internal improvements\r\n(see above). _A fortiori_, therefore, they can hardly loan money or\r\ncredit to private interests be they never so much for the general\r\nbenefit. The difficulty of testing all such laws has been adverted to,\r\nat least in the case of taxation. For that purpose Massachusetts has\r\na wise law providing machinery by which such matters may be contested\r\nupon the action of any ten tax-payers.\r\n\r\nThere are three great questions before us in the immediate future--the\r\nnegro, local or self government, and taxation, which last is the chief\r\nproblem of city and town government.\r\n\r\nThe world has never before tried the experiment of municipal\r\ngovernment, where those who have the local vote do not generally pay\r\nthe local taxes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX\r\n\r\nFINAL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne would suppose that a democracy which believes in the absolute\r\npanacea of law-making would take particular pains with the forms of\r\nits legislation, to have its statutes clear, in good English, not\r\ncontradictory, properly expressed and properly authenticated. You\r\nwould certainly suppose that the people who believe that everything\r\nshould be done under a written law would take the greatest pains to\r\nsee that law was _official_; also, that it was clear, so as to be\r\n\"understanded of the people\"; also, that it did not contain a thousand\r\ncontradictions and uncertainties. When our--I will not say wiser, but\r\ncertainly better educated--forefathers met in national convention to\r\nadopt a constitution, one of the first things they did was to appoint\r\na \"Committee on Style.\" It is needless to say that no such committee\r\nexists in any American legislature. You would suppose they would take\r\npains to see that all the laws were printed in one or more books where\r\nthe people could find them. This is not the case in New York or in\r\nmany of our greater States. You would also suppose that when they\r\npassed another law on the same subject they would say how much of the\r\nformer law they meant to repeal, but in many States that also is not\r\ndone. It would probably be too much to hope that they should not\r\nconfuse the subject with a new law on a matter already completely\r\ncovered; but the form of their legislation should be improved at least\r\nin the first three particulars I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nWhat is the fact? The secretary of one new State reports that the\r\nlaws, as served up to him by the legislature, are \"so full of\r\ncontradictions, omissions, repetitions, bad grammar, and bad spelling\"\r\nthat it has been impossible for him to print them and make any sense;\r\nthe bad grammar and the bad spelling, at least, he has, therefore,\r\npresumed to correct. But what should surprise us still more is, that\r\nin very few of our States is there any authentic edition of the laws\r\nwhatever, and quite a number do not publish their constitutions!\r\n\r\nThe worst condition of all is found in the national legislation of\r\nCongress, until very recently in the great State of New York, and in\r\nthose States which have adopted the code system generally. I do not\r\nsay this as an opponent of general codes, but I am constrained to note\r\nas a fact that those States are the ones which have their legislation\r\nin the worst shape of any. The charm of the statute theory is that\r\nthe half-educated lawyer or layman supposes he can find all the laws\r\nwritten in one book. Abraham Lincoln even is said to have had the\r\nmajor part of his \"shelf of best books\" composed of an old copy of the\r\nstatutes of Indiana, though I can find no traces of such reading in\r\nthe style of his Gettysburg address. But how far is this democratic\r\nclaim that the laws of a State are all contained in one book borne out\r\nby the facts?\r\n\r\nOf our fifty States and Territories only Alabama, Arizona, the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland,\r\nMassachusetts, Montana, New Hampshire, New York (partially), North\r\nCarolina, Rhode Island, South Carolina, Vermont, and Wisconsin\r\n(sixteen States) have any official revision or \"General Laws\"; that\r\nis to say, one or more volumes containing the complete mass of\r\nlegislation, up to the time of their issue, formally enacted by the\r\nlegislature. A number of other States have what are called \"authorized\r\nrevisions\" or authorized editions of the law. This phrase I use to\r\nmean a codification by one or more men (usually a commission of three)\r\nwho are duly appointed for the purpose, under a valid act of the\r\nState legislature, but whose compilation, when made, is never in form\r\nadopted by the legislature itself. Leaving out the constitutional\r\nquestion whether such a book is in any sense law at all--for in all\r\nprobability no legislature can delegate to any three gentlemen the\r\npower to make laws, even one law, much more all the laws of the\r\nState--leaving out the constitutional question. It is very doubtful\r\nhow far such compilations are reliable, although printed in a book\r\nsaid to be authorized and official, and held out to the public as\r\nsuch. That is to say, if the real law, as originally enacted, differs\r\nin any sense or meaning from the law as set forth in this so-called\r\n\"authorized publication,\" the latter will have no validity. Indeed,\r\nsome States say this expressly. They provide that these compilations,\r\nalthough authorized, are only admissible _in evidence_ of what the\r\nstatutes of the State really are--that is to say, only valid if\r\nuncontradicted. It was impossible to correspond with all the States\r\nupon this point--if, indeed, I could have got opinions from their\r\nrespective supreme courts, for no other opinion would be of any value.\r\nThe compilation of the State of Arkansas says, somewhere near its\r\ntitle-page, that it is \"approved by Sam W. Williams.\" It does not\r\nappear who Sam W. Williams is, what authority he had to approve it, or\r\nwhether his approval gave to the laws contained in that bulky volume\r\nany increased validity. This is a typical example of the \"authorized\"\r\nrevision, and this is the state of things that exists in such\r\nimportant States as Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Hawaii,\r\nIdaho, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New\r\nMexico, North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Tennessee, Utah, Virginia,\r\nand Wyoming (twenty in all).\r\n\r\nBefore leaving these States, which do have some form of \"revised\r\nstatutes\" or complete code--and be it remembered that I am never here\r\nspeaking of annual laws, for however bad their form and the form of\r\ntheir publication, they are usually, at least, _official_--it will be\r\ninteresting, and, I think, throw further light on the subject, to\r\ncull some passages from the laws of States having such \"authorized\r\nrevisions,\" to show how far their real authority extends. The general\r\nstatutes of 1897 of the State of Kentucky say on their title-page that\r\nthey are an authorized compilation approved by the Supreme Court, but\r\nthe form of approval of the Supreme Court of Kentucky runs as follows:\r\n\"Although we consider this duty not lawfully imposed upon us,\" they\r\nsay that, so far as they have observed, they \"detect no errors in the\r\ncompilation and it seems to have been properly done.\" Of how much\r\nvalue such approval would be in case there turned out to be a\r\ndiscrepancy between the compilation and the original statute, I leave\r\nto the lawyers to judge. The compiled laws of New Mexico of the same\r\nyear, made by the solicitor-general, contain an amusing statement\r\nunder his own signature, that he believes \"a large part of the laws\r\nhe there prints are either obsolete or have actually been repealed by\r\ncertain later statutes,\" but he, as it were, shovels them in, in the\r\nhope that some of them may be good!\r\n\r\nThe commissioners of the State of North Dakota go still farther.\r\nTheir code of 1895 bears a statement that it is, by authority of law,\r\n\"brought to date\" by the commissioners, who go on to say that\r\nthey have compared the codes of other States and have added and\r\nincorporated many other laws taken from such codes of other States,\r\napparently because the commissioners thought them of value! One must\r\nreally ask any first-year student of constitutional legislation what\r\nhe thinks of that statement, not only of its constitutionality, but of\r\nits audacity. Finally, the State of South Dakota says, in its statutes\r\nof 1899, what I quoted at the beginning--that \"all the laws contained\r\nin the book are to be considered as admissible in evidence,\" but not\r\nconclusive of their own authenticity or correct statement.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the third, and, from the point of view of the believer\r\nin statutes, probably the worst class of all. That is to say, States\r\nwhich have no official or authorized compilation whatever and which\r\nrely entirely upon the enterprise of money-making publishers to make a\r\nbook which correctly prints the laws, and all the laws, of the State\r\nin question. For one State, at least, such a compilation was made by a\r\nfew industrious newspaper correspondents at Washington! The States and\r\nTerritories that are in this cheerful condition are, as I have said:\r\nNew York (in part) the Territory of Alaska, California, Colorado,\r\nIllinois, Indiana--that is to say, there has been no official\r\nrevision since 1881 and everybody, in fact, uses a privately\r\nprepared digest--Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Mississippi, Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, Washington, and West Virginia (fourteen in all). Besides\r\nthis, there are other States such as Wisconsin and Indiana, already\r\nmentioned, where there is no official _recent_ revision, so that\r\neverybody depends upon a private compilation, which is the only one\r\nprocurable.\r\n\r\nSo much for the authenticity of the books themselves which contain the\r\nlaws upon which we all have to depend. Now, coming to the form of the\r\nlaws. As I have already remarked, there is no committee on style.\r\nThere is no attempt whatever made at scientific drafting. To give an\r\nexample of what difference this may make in mere convenience, it is\r\nonly a few weeks since, in Massachusetts, a chapter of law to protect\r\nthe public against personal injuries caused by insolvent railway and\r\nstreet railway companies was drawn up by a good lawyer, and contained\r\nbetween twenty and thirty sections, or about three pages of print.\r\nIt was brought to another lawyer, certainly no better lawyer, but a\r\nlegislative expert, who got all that was desired into one section\r\nof five lines. There is no committee on style, there is no expert\r\ndrafting. The case of the recent Massachusetts statute declaring the\r\ncommon law to be the common law, and therefore jeopardizing the very\r\nobject of the statute, will not be forgotten (see p. 188 above). There\r\nare certain definite recommendations I should like to make.\r\n\r\nFirst, adopt the provision that \"no statute shall be regarded as\r\nrepealed unless mentioned as repealed, and when a law is amended, the\r\nwhole law shall be printed as amended in full.\" This would acquaint\r\nthe legislature with the law already existing, before they proceed to\r\nchange it. Next provide that all laws shall be printed and published\r\nby a _State_ publisher and the authenticity of all revisions be duly\r\nguaranteed by their being submitted to the legislature and re-enacted\r\n_en bloc_, as is our practice with revisions in Massachusetts and some\r\nas other States. Third, the local or private acts should be separated\r\nfrom the public laws, and they might advantageously even be printed in\r\na separate volume, as is done in some States already. But who shall\r\ndetermine whether it is a private, local or special act, or a general\r\nlaw? I can only answer that that must be left to the legislature\r\nuntil we adopt the system strongly to be recommended of a permanent,\r\npreliminary, expert draftsman. Finally, no legislation must ever be\r\n_absolutely_ delegated. That is to say, even if a revision is drawn up\r\nby an authorized commission, their work should be afterward ratified\r\nby the legislature. It is said, I think, that the constitution of\r\nVirginia, drawn up by a constitutional convention, was never ratified\r\nby the people. If so, there is a grave constitutional doubt whether it\r\nor any part of it may not be repealed at any time by a simple statute.\r\nBut can a constituent body of the mass of the people, the fundamental\r\nand original political entity of the Anglo-Saxon world, be forbidden\r\nfrom delegating its legislative power, as its representatives\r\nthemselves are forbidden?\r\n\r\nThe last matter, that of arrangement, order of printing, and form of\r\ntitle, is so directly connected with that of indexing that I shall\r\ntreat the two things together. Now, there are three different methods\r\nof arrangement, or lack of arrangement, to be found in printing\r\nthe laws of our forty-six States and four Territories, both in the\r\nrevisions and in the annual laws. The revisions, however, are more apt\r\nto have a _topical_ arrangement, and to be divided into chapters,\r\nwith titles, each containing a special subject and arranged, either\r\ntopically, or, in some States, even so intelligent otherwise as are\r\nPennsylvania and New Jersey, arranged with the elementary stupidity of\r\nthe alphabetical system. I say, stupid; when, for instance, you have a\r\nchapter on \"Corporations,\" no one can tell whether the legislature or\r\ncompilers are going to put it under \"C\" for corporations, under \"I\"\r\nfor incorporations, or under \"J\" for joint-stock companies. The\r\nalphabetical system of arrangement is the most contemptible of all,\r\nand should be relegated to a limbo at once. The annual laws, of\r\ncourse, are much less likely to have any arrangement whatever. Passed\r\nchronologically, they are more apt to follow in the order of their\r\npassage.\r\n\r\nNow these systems as we find them are as follows: in nearly all States\r\npublic and private laws are lumped together, although in a few they\r\nare indexed separately. Most of the States to-day, including all the\r\n\"code\" States, adopt the topical system of arrangement, as, indeed,\r\nmust be the case in anything that might, by any possibility, be called\r\na code, and even a general \"revision\" of the statutes will naturally\r\nfall into chapters covering certain subjects. A few States, as I have\r\nsaid, cling to the crude alphabetical system, and quite a number have\r\nno discernible system whatever. In some States the annual laws are\r\narranged by number, in some by date of passage, and in some apparently\r\naccording to the sweet will of the printer. In those States which do\r\nnot arrange them or entitle them by date of passage we have to depend\r\non the crude and dangerous system of citation by page. Acts of\r\nCongress are sometimes cited by date of passage, sometimes more\r\nformally by volume and number of the Statutes at Large, and more often\r\nthan either, probably, by the popular name of the statute, such as the\r\n\"Sherman Act,\" the \"Hepburn Act,\" or the \"Interstate Commerce Law.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems to me we should recommend one system. That for the codes or\r\ngeneral revisions should certainly be topical. That of the annual laws\r\nmay either be topical or chronological, but the statutes, in whatever\r\norder they are printed, should be _numbered_ and cited by number. No\r\nalphabetical arrangement ever should be permitted.\r\n\r\nAs to indexing we should urge upon State legislatures, secretaries\r\nof State, and official draftsmen (when we get any) that the very\r\nexcellent system contained in the New York Year Book of Legislation\r\nshould be adopted for all volumes of State laws. It is as bad for the\r\nindex to be too big as to be too little, and it does not follow that\r\nthe good draftsman is a good indexer. The index to our Revised Laws\r\nof Massachusetts is contained in one large separate volume of 570\r\ndouble-column pages. To look for a statute in the index is just about\r\nas bad as to look for it in the revision itself. The most important\r\npoint of all is the proper choice of subject titles. Laws should\r\nbe indexed under the general subject or branch of the science of\r\njurisprudence, or the subject-matter to which they belong, not too\r\ntechnically and not too much according to mere logic. For example, any\r\nlawyer or any student of civics who wished to learn about the labor\r\nlaws of a State, whether, for instance, it had a nine-hour law or not,\r\nwould look in the index under the head of \"Labor.\" _Labor_ has become,\r\nfor all our minds, the general head under which that great and\r\nimportant mass of legislation concerning the relation of all employers\r\nand employees, and the condition and treatment of mechanical or other\r\nlabor, naturally falls. But if you search in our elaborate index of\r\nMassachusetts for the head of \"_Labor_\" you will not find it. If you\r\nlook under \"_Employment of Labor_\" you will find it, but you cannot be\r\ncertain that you will find all of it, and you will find it under so\r\nmany heads that it would take you quite ten or fifteen minutes to read\r\nthrough and find out whether there is an \"hours-of-labor\" law or not.\r\nOn the other hand, purely technical matters, such as \"_Abatement_\" are\r\nusually well indexed, because their names are what we call \"terms of\r\nart,\" under which any lawyer would look.\r\n\r\nBut, after all, it does not so much matter what system we adopt as\r\nlong as it is the same system. At present I know of nothing better\r\nthan the forty heads contained in the \"Principal Headings\" of the New\r\nYork State Library Index, though I should like to change the names of\r\na few. For instance, \"Combinations or Monopolies\" is not the head to\r\nwhich the lawyer would naturally look for statutes against Trusts. The\r\nword \"trust\" has become a term of art. If not put under \"Trusts\" it\r\nshould be under \"Restraint of trade\" or \"Monopolies,\" but the word\r\n\"combination\" is neither old nor new, legal nor popular. A combination\r\nis lawful. If unlawful, it is _not_ a combination, but a conspiracy.\r\n\r\nThe most important statute of the United States is perhaps the most\r\nhorrible example of slovenliness, bad form, and contradiction of all.\r\nThe \"Hepburn Act\" is the amended Interstate Commerce Act, and is\r\nprinted by Congress in a pamphlet incorporating with it quite a\r\ndifferent act known as the Elkins Act, besides the Safety Appliance\r\nAct, the Arbitration Act, and several others. We all remember under\r\nwhat political stress this legislation was passed, with Congress\r\nbalking, the senators going one way, the attorney-general another, the\r\nradical congressmen in front, and the president pushing them all. It\r\nis easily intelligible that such a condition of things should not tend\r\nto lucid legislation, particularly when an opposing minority do not\r\ndesire the legislation at all, and hope to leave it in such a shape\r\nas to be contradictory, or unconstitutional--or both. (This has been\r\nintentionally done more than once.) All of it a mass of contradictions\r\nor overlaying amendments, the first important part of it which came\r\nunder the scrutiny of the Supreme Court only escaped being held\r\nunconstitutional by being emasculated. Its other clauses have yet to\r\nface that dreaded scrutiny. Its basic principle has yet to be declared\r\nconstitutional, while the only principle which has proved of any value\r\nwas law already. This wonderful product of compromise starts off by\r\nsaying \"Be it enacted, etc., Section I as amended June 29, 1906.\" It\r\nbegins with an amendment to itself. It does not tell you how much of\r\nthe prior law was repealed, except upon a careful scrutiny which only\r\npaid lawyers were willing to give. Upon the old Interstate Commerce\r\nAct of 1887, after quoting it substantially in full, it adds a mass of\r\nother provisions, some of which are _in pari materia_, some not; some\r\ncontradictory and some mere repetitions. It amends acts by later\r\nacts and, before they have gone into effect, wipes them out by\r\nsubstitutions. It hitches on extraneous matters and it amends past\r\nlegislation by mere inference. Like a hornet it stings in the end,\r\nwhere revolutionary changes are introduced by altering or adding a\r\nword or two in sections a page long, and it ends with the cheerful but\r\ntoo usual statement that \"all laws and parts of laws in conflict with\r\nprovisions of this act are hereby repealed.\" As a result no one can\r\nhonestly say he is sure he understands it, any more than any serious\r\nlawyer can be certain that its important provisions are any one of\r\nthem constitutional. And that huge statute with sections numbered 1,\r\n2, 5, 16, 16_a_, etc., with amendments added and substituted, amended\r\nand unamended, is contained in twenty-seven closely printed pages. I\r\nventure to assert boldly that any competent lawyer who is also a\r\ngood parliamentary draftsman could put those twenty-seven pages of\r\nobscurity into four pages, at most, of lucidity, with two days' honest\r\nwork. By how little wisdom the world is governed! And how little the\r\nrepresentatives of the people care for the litigation or trouble\r\nor expense that their own slovenliness causes the people! For the\r\nnecessity of political compromise is no excuse for this.\r\n\r\nI therefore urged before the National Association of State Libraries,\r\nat their annual meeting of 1909, that they should use their influence\r\nwith the various State governments at least--\"1, that all revisions\r\nbe authenticated, authorized, and published by the State; 2, that\r\nthe annual laws be separated, public from private, and be printed by\r\nnumbered chapters arranged either chronologically or topically; 3,\r\nthat the indexes be arranged under the forty general heads used by\r\nthe New York State Library in its annual digest, with such additional\r\nheads as may, perhaps, prove necessary in some States, such as, for\r\ninstance, Louisiana, which has subjects and titles of jurisprudence\r\nnot known to the ordinary common-law States; 4, that the constitutions\r\nbe printed with the laws; 5, that every State, under a law, employ a\r\npermanent, paid parliamentary or legislative draftsman whose duty it\r\nshall be to recast, at least in matters of style and arrangement, all\r\nacts before they are passed to be engrossed.\"\r\n\r\nAny private member introducing a bill can, of course, avail himself\r\nof the draftsman's services before the bill is originally drawn. His\r\nadvice may be required by the legislature or by legislative committees\r\non the question whether the proposed legislation is necessary, that\r\nis to say, whether it is not covered by laws previously existing. It\r\nshall be his duty then to edit the laws, arrange them for publication,\r\nand to authenticate by his signature the volumes of the annual laws.\r\nOne person is better than two or three for such work, but he should\r\nbe paid a very large salary so that he can afford to make it his life\r\nwork. He should be appointed for a very long term and should have\r\nample clerical assistance. It should also be his duty to correspond\r\nand exchange information with similar officials in other States.\r\nIn other words, he with his assistants should be the legislative\r\nreference department. These recommendations were duly referred to the\r\nCommittee on Uniformity in preparation of session laws.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt some risk of wearying the reader I have attempted superficially\r\nto cover a very extensive field. I started with quoting Blackstone's\r\nremark that there is no other science in which so little education\r\nis supposed to be necessary as that of legislation. These words were\r\npenned by him more than one hundred and fifty years ago and there\r\nis still no book upon this subject; the books on Government,\r\nParliamentary Law, and Hermeneutics concerning respectively the\r\nsource, the procedure, and the interpretation of legislation, not\r\nthe content thereof. I can but hope to have called attention to the\r\nimmense importance of this subject, particularly in our representative\r\ndemocracy, and I will beg my readers who have been patient with me to\r\nthe end to reflect for more than a moment on the extraordinarily novel\r\nstate of things that this modern notion of the legislative function\r\nbrings about. It is a commonplace of historical writers to open their\r\nfirst chapter by calling attention to the difference made by steel and\r\nelectricity, to the fact that it took longer to get from Boston to\r\nWashington in 1776 than it does to-day from Maine to California\r\nand back; that it took longer even for the rural legislator in the\r\nConnecticut Valley to get to his State Capitol than it does to-day\r\nto go from there to Washington. But no one, I think, has ever called\r\nattention to the enormous differences in living, in business, in\r\npolitical temper between the days (which practically lasted until the\r\nlast century) when a citizen, a merchant, an employer of labor, or a\r\nlaboring man, still more a corporation or association, and lastly, a\r\nman even in his most intimate relations, the husband and the father,\r\nwell knew the law as _familiar_ law, a law with which he had grown up,\r\nand to which he had adapted his life, his marriage, the education\r\nof his children, his business career and his entrance into public\r\nlife--and these days of to-day, when all those doing business under a\r\ncorporate firm primarily, but also those doing business at all;\r\nall owners of property, all employers of labor, all bankers or\r\nmanufacturers or consumers; all citizens, in their gravest and their\r\nleast actions, also must look into their newspapers every morning to\r\nmake sure that the whole law of life has not been changed for them by\r\na statute passed overnight; when not only no lawyer may maintain an\r\noffice without the most recent day-by-day bulletins on legislation,\r\nbut may not advise on the simplest proposition of marriage or divorce,\r\nof a wife's share in a husband's property, of her freedom of contract,\r\nwithout sending not only to his own State legislature, but for the\r\nmost recent statute of any other State which may have a bearing on\r\nthe situation. Moreover, these statutes, which at any moment may\r\nrevolutionize a man's liberty or his property, are not as they were in\r\nold times--a mere codification, or attempt at the best expression of\r\na law already existing and well \"understanded of the people\"; but may\r\nand probably will represent a complete reversal of experience, an\r\nabsolute alteration of human relations, a paradox of all that has gone\r\nbefore; and even when they endeavor not to do so, as in the case of\r\nthat Massachusetts statute above referred to, their authors' lack of\r\neducation in the science of legislation may unintentionally cause a\r\nrevolution in the law. And even when a statute does not do this, no\r\nlawyer can be certain what it means until, years or decades afterward,\r\nit has received recognition from an authoritative court. That is why\r\nmuch complaint has been made of lawyers; they are said not to know\r\ntheir business, not to be able to tell what the law is. The head of\r\na great railroad has recently complained that he was only anxious to\r\nobey the law, but had great difficulty in finding out what the law\r\nwas. Any good lawyer with common sense knows the common law and usage\r\nof the people; but no one could tell at the time of its passage what,\r\nfor instance, the Sherman Act, enacted twenty-three years ago, meant;\r\nthe twenty-three years have elapsed; the anti-trust law has been\r\nbefore the courts a thousand times, and the best lawyers in the\r\ncountry do not to-day know what it means; and the highest tribunal\r\nin the land is so uncertain on the subject that it has ordered the\r\nStandard Oil case reargued.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that one must not recognize the meaning and the\r\nneed of law-making by statute; of law made by the people themselves\r\nto suit present conditions. \"There should be a law about it,\" is the\r\npopular phrase--commonly there _is_ a law about it, and the best of\r\nall law, because tested by time and experience; only, the people\r\ndo not realize this, and their power and practice of immediate\r\nlegislation is not only the great event in our modern science of\r\ngovernment, but it is also the greatest change in the rules and\r\nconditions of our _living_, and our _doing_, and our _having_. Not\r\nonly our office-holders, but we ourselves, are born, labor, inherit,\r\npossess, marry, devise, and combine, under a perpetual plebiscitum,\r\nreferendum, and recall. I can only hope that I have made some\r\nsuggestions to my readers which will awaken their interest to the\r\nimportance of the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbbot of Lilleshall
