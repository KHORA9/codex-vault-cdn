In\r\ndoing so, my rule of_ SAYING WHAT I THINK _was followed.

Watson,_\r\n\r\n“_Dear Sir: We have read your estimate of Abraham Lincoln. We tried\r\nour best to figure out some way by which it could be shaped around in\r\na manner that would be suitable for our magazine. You see, first of\r\nall, in dealing with Lincoln or any Civil War subject we cannot afford\r\nin any way to stir up sectional feeling. I am afraid your article is\r\nopen to criticism in this respect. If you were only in New York, and we\r\ncould go over this thing personally, I have no doubt but what we might\r\nframe up an article that would be mutually satisfactory. The time is\r\nso limited that I suppose we will just have to give it up. Yours very\r\ntruly,_\r\n\r\n                                             _Editorial Department._”)\r\n\r\nWhen the editor of —— Magazine applied to me for an article on\r\nAbraham Lincoln, my first inclination was to decline the commission.\r\nAlthough it is high time that some one should strike a note of sanity\r\nin the universal laudation of Mr. Lincoln, a Southern man is not,\r\nperhaps, the proper person to do it. On further consideration, however,\r\nit occurred to me that my position was radically different from that of\r\nany other public man in the South. People on the other side of Mason\r\nand Dixon’s line cannot be ignorant or oblivious of the fact that for\r\nthe last twenty years I have waged warfare upon the Bourbonism of my\r\nown section and the narrowness of my own people. In every possible\r\nway I have appealed to them to rise above sectional prejudice and\r\nparty bigotry. While I, myself, have suffered terribly during this\r\nlong series of years, some good has followed my work. Twenty years\r\nago, a white man in the South who openly professed himself a member\r\nof the Republican party was socially ostracised. Every one realizes\r\nhow completely that state of things has been revolutionized,—we see\r\nit in the heavy Republican vote cast in Southern States in the recent\r\nelection; we see it in the ovations given to Mr. Roosevelt and to Mr.\r\nTaft in the Southern cities.\r\n\r\nMy part in bringing about this change for the better is so well known\r\nin the North that no well informed man or woman will attribute to\r\nsectionalism anything in my estimate of Mr. Lincoln which may appear to\r\nbe harsh or unjust.\r\n\r\nLet us see to what extent the adulation of Mr. Lincoln has gone.\r\n\r\nIn Harper’s Weekly for November 7th, 1908, a British gentleman of the\r\nname of P. D. Ross offers to amend the high estimate which Colonel\r\nHarvey had already placed upon Mr. Lincoln by classing our martyred\r\nPresident as “The greatest man the world has produced.” Colonel Harvey\r\nsoberly accepts the amendment,—thus Miss Ida Tarbell is left far\r\nbehind, and Hay and Nicolay eclipsed.\r\n\r\nOne of the more recent biographers of Mr. Lincoln hotly denounced as\r\nuntrue the statement that “He used to sit around and tell anecdotes\r\nlike a traveling man.”\r\n\r\nDo we not all remember how, as children, we were fascinated with the\r\nstory of “The Scottish Chiefs”, by Miss Jane Porter? Did not the Sir\r\nWilliam Wallace of that good lady’s romance appeal to us as a perfect\r\nhero, an ideal knight, exemplifying in himself the loftiest type of\r\nchivalry? Yet, when we grew to be older, we were not surprised to learn\r\nthat Sir Walter Scott—certainly a good judge of such matters, and\r\ncertainly a patriotic Scotchman—wrathfully and contemptuously found\r\nfault with Miss Porter because she had made “a fine gentleman” out of a\r\ngreat, rugged, national hero. Every well balanced American, North and\r\nSouth, ought to feel the same way toward those authors who take Abraham\r\nLincoln into their hands, dress him up, tone him down, polish him and\r\nchange him until he is no longer the same man.\r\n\r\nThe outpouring of Lincolnian eulogy which will greet the country in\r\nFebruary will probably be all of a sort—indiscriminate praise—each\r\norator and speaker straining and struggling to carry the high water\r\nmark of laudation higher than it has ever yet gone.\r\n\r\n_Let us study Mr. Lincoln with an earnest desire to find out what he\r\nwas._ Let it be remembered that the biography of him written by his\r\nlaw partner, Mr. Herndon, was that biography in which the best picture\r\nof him might have been expected. His law partner was his friend,\r\npersonally and politically. It was that law partner who converted him\r\nto abolitionism. To the task of writing the biography of the deceased\r\nmember of the firm, Mr. Herndon brought devotion to the memory of a man\r\nwhom he had respected and loved; yet, being honest, he told the truth\r\nabout Mr. Lincoln,—painting his portrait with the warts on. _The fact\r\nthat this record, written by a sorrowing friend, was destroyed_, and a\r\nspurious, after-thought Herndon biography put in its place, must always\r\nbe a fact worthy of serious consideration.\r\n\r\nI can imagine one of the reasons for the suppression of Herndon’s\r\noriginal manuscript when I note, with amusement, the vigor and\r\nindignation with which a later biographer defends Mr. Lincoln from the\r\nterrible accusation of “sitting around and telling anecdotes to amuse a\r\ncrowd.”\r\n\r\nThose who take the least pains to ascertain the facts as to Mr.\r\nLincoln’s story telling habits soon convince themselves that nothing\r\nsaid upon the subject could well be an exaggeration. In his day, the\r\nbroadest, vulgarest anecdotes were current in the South and West, and\r\nthousands of public men, who ought to have been ashamed of themselves\r\nfor doing so, made a practice of repeating these stories to juries\r\nin the court house, to crowds on the hustings, and to groups in the\r\nstreets, stores and hotels.\r\n\r\nUpon one occasion, while I was in conversation with Thomas H. Tibbles,\r\na surviving personal acquaintance of John Brown and Abraham Lincoln, I\r\ninterrogated him eagerly as to both. Directing his attention to this\r\nmatter of Mr. Lincoln’s alleged fondness for the relation of smutty\r\nstories, Mr. Tibbles very promptly replied that the very first time\r\nhe ever saw Mr. Lincoln he was directed to his room in the hotel by a\r\nseries of bursts of loud laughter. Mr. Tibbles’ curiosity was aroused\r\nby the continuous hilarity which resounded from this particular room\r\nand he went to it. There he found a great, long, raw-boned man seated\r\nin a chair with his big feet up on the table, telling smutty yarns to a\r\ncircle of men who were exploding with laughter at the end of each story.\r\n\r\nEvery man must be judged by the standards of his time. People of\r\nelegance and refinement, according to the standards of the Elizabethan\r\nage, listened to comedies which were considered in good taste then, but\r\nwhich would not be tolerated in any decent community now. The manners\r\nof the West and of the rural South in Mr. Lincoln’s day, were quite\r\ndifferent from what they are now. Even now, however, there are men who\r\ncall themselves gentlemen, and women who think they are ladies, that\r\nmake a specialty of cultivating a talent for the relation of doubtful\r\nstories. The fact that Mr. Lincoln let his gift of entertainment and\r\nhis fondness for the humorous lead him down to the low plane of his\r\naudience does not by any means indicate a defect of heart or mind. As a\r\nlawyer and as a politician, it was a part of his business to cultivate\r\npopularity. He made friends in just such circles as that into which\r\nMr. Tibbles walked. The men who laughed with Mr. Lincoln, enjoying the\r\ninimitable way in which he related anecdotes, naturally warmed to him,\r\nand they gave him verdicts and votes.\r\n\r\nMr. P. D. Ross, Editor of the Ottawa (Canada) _National_, claims that\r\nMr. Lincoln was “The greatest man the world has produced”, and the\r\neditor of _Harper’s Weekly_ soberly falls into line.\r\n\r\nWell, there should be some standard by which one is enabled to measure\r\na man’s greatness. Mr. Lincoln was a lawyer, a statesman, and a chief\r\nmagistrate of a republic. In each of these capacities let us see what\r\nwas his rank.\r\n\r\nDoes any one claim that he was the greatest lawyer that ever lived?\r\nSurely not. There is not the slightest doubt that Mr. Lincoln was a\r\nfamous verdict getter. He could do about as much with a jury as any\r\nadvocate in the West, but he certainly never won any court house\r\nvictories that were more famous than those of Dan Voorhees, Emory\r\nStorrs, Bob Ingersoll, Matt Carpenter, Sargent Prentiss, Robert Toombs\r\nand of scores of other lawyers who could easily be named. In knowledge\r\nof the law, force of mental power of the judicial sort,—such as Chief\r\nJustice John Marshall and Daniel Webster and Rufus Choate had,—does\r\nanybody for a moment claim that Mr. Lincoln out-ranks all other\r\nlawyers? Surely not. He is not to be named in the same class as Reverdy\r\nJohnson, Jeremiah Black, or Senator Edmunds, Charles O’Connor,—to say\r\nnothing of Jeremiah Mason, of Massachusetts, and Luther Martin, of\r\nMaryland, William Pinckney, of the same State, and Edmund Randolph, of\r\nVirginia.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln served in Congress. Did he cut any figure there? None\r\nwhatever. He appeared to be out of his element. His Congressional\r\nrecord is not to be compared to that of Thaddeus Stevens or Stephen\r\nA. Douglas. We look into the lives of such men as Benjamin Franklin,\r\nthe elder Adams, of Thomas Jefferson, of Clay, Calhoun and Webster,\r\nof Alexander Hamilton and George Washington, and there is no trouble\r\nin finding _their_ foot-prints on the sands of time; but in the\r\nachievements of statesmanship _where are the foot-prints of Mr.\r\nLincoln_? You will look into the statute-books in vain to find them.\r\nWe have a great financial policy, born of the creative, forceful\r\nstatesmanship of Alexander Hamilton and Henry Clay; we have a great\r\nprotective system, owing its origin to the same two statesmen; we have\r\na great homestead policy, which owes its birth to Andrew Johnson, of\r\nTennessee; we have a great national policy of internal improvements,\r\nbut Mr. Lincoln was not its father. _Consequently, there is not a\r\nsingle national line of policy which owes its paternity to this\r\nstatesman whom Mr. Ross classes as “The greatest man the world has\r\nproduced.”_\r\n\r\nIn the State of Illinois, compare Mr. Lincoln’s work with Mr.\r\nJefferson’s work in the State of Virginia. Did Mr. Lincoln leave his\r\nimpress any where upon the established order in Illinois? I have never\r\nheard of it. In Virginia, Jefferson found the church and state united,\r\nboth taxing the people and dividing the spoils. Mr. Jefferson divorced\r\nthe church from the state, confiscated the church’s ill-gotten wealth,\r\ndevoting it to charitable and educational purposes; and put an end to\r\nlegalized religious intolerance. In Virginia there was a land monopoly,\r\nperpetuated by entails and primogenitures. Mr. Jefferson made war\r\nupon it, broke it up, and thus overthrew the local aristocracy. He\r\nformulated a school system and established in America its first modern\r\ncollege. Can anything which Mr. Lincoln, the statesman, did in Illinois\r\ncompare with Mr. Jefferson’s work in Virginia?\r\n\r\nSo far as national statesmanship is concerned, Mr. Lincoln is not to\r\nbe classed with either of “The Great Trio”, nor with Mr. Jefferson,\r\nnor with Alexander Hamilton. Each of the five named were statesmen of\r\nthe first order, possessing original, creative ability in that field\r\nof work. There is no evidence whatever that Mr. Lincoln possessed that\r\ntalent.\r\n\r\nIt must be, then, as chief magistrate of the republic that he won the\r\ntitle of “great.” That, in fact, is the case. He was a great chief\r\nexecutive. As such, he deserves immortality. Because he sealed his\r\nwork with his life-blood, his memory will always be sacred. But, is\r\nit absolutely certain that no other American would have succeeded in\r\npiloting the vessel of state through the storm of the Civil War? Is\r\nit quite certain that Stephen A. Douglas, himself, would not have\r\nsucceeded where Mr. Lincoln succeeded? Who knows and can dogmatically\r\nsay that Thaddeus Stevens or Oliver Morton, or Zach Chandler, or Ben\r\nWade could not have done it? What was it that Mr. Lincoln did during\r\nthe Civil War that was so much greater and grander than what might have\r\nbeen expected from Andrew Jackson in the same crisis? Somehow I fail\r\nto see it. He did not lose courage, but there were brave men before\r\nAgamemnon, and the world has never been lacking in heroic types that\r\nstand forth and meet emergencies.\r\n\r\nIn studying Mr. Lincoln’s course during the Civil War we can discover\r\na great deal of patience, a great deal of tact, a great deal of\r\ndiplomacy, a great deal of determination to win, a great deal of\r\nconsecration to patriotic duty. He struck the right key-note when he\r\nsaid that he was fighting not to free the negroes but to preserve the\r\nUnion. This insight into the situation which enabled him to take the\r\nstrongest possible position showed political genius of a high order.\r\nThis alone would entitle him to be classed as a great statesman, a\r\ngreat chief magistrate, a great national leader.\r\n\r\nWhen we calmly reflect upon what he had to do, and the means which\r\nwere at his command for doing it, we see nothing in the result that\r\nborders upon the miraculous. All the advantage was on his side. The\r\nfire-eaters of the South played into his hands beautifully. They were\r\nso very blind to what was necessary for their success that they even\r\nsurrendered possession of Washington City, when they might just as\r\nwell have held it and rushed their troops to it, thus making sure not\r\nonly of Baltimore, but of the whole State of Maryland—to say nothing\r\nof the enormous moral advantage of holding possession of the capital\r\nof the nation. It was a clever strategy which, while talking peace,\r\nadopted those measures which compelled the Confederate authorities\r\nto fire upon the flag at Fort Sumter. But that most effective bit of\r\nstrategy appears to have had its birth in the fertile brain of William\r\nH. Seward. The diplomacy which kept dangling before the eyes of the\r\nborder states the promise to pay for the slaves until the necessity of\r\nduping the waverers had passed, was clever in its way; but there is\r\nno evidence that the fine Italian hand of Mr. Seward was not in this\r\npolicy also.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle of Bull Run, Congress passed a resolution declaring\r\nthat the war was being waged for the sole purpose of preserving the\r\nUnion, and that the Federal Government had no intention of interfering\r\nwith slavery. This was subtle politics and it had the desired effect\r\nupon the doubtful Southern States; but there is no evidence that Mr.\r\nLincoln was the first to suggest the resolution.\r\n\r\nWas Mr. Lincoln sincere in making the beautiful and touching plea for\r\npeace, in his first inaugural? Unquestionably. Yet he would make no\r\nconcessions, nor encourage any efforts at reconciliation. He opposed\r\nthe Crittenden Compromise, which demanded no sacrifice of principle\r\nby the North and which surrendered much that had been claimed by the\r\nSouth. Of the 1,200,000 square miles of public domain, the Southern\r\nleaders offered to close 900,000 square miles to slavery, leaving it\r\nto the people of the remaining 300,000 square miles to decide for or\r\nagainst slavery when they came to frame their state constitutions.\r\nDemocrats, North and South, favored this Compromise. The Republicans\r\nrejected it. Then, the last hope of peaceable settlement was gone.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln threw his influence as President-elect against the Peace\r\nCongress, and rejected the South’s offer to adjust the sectional\r\ndifferences by a restoration and extension of the old Missouri\r\nCompromise line.\r\n\r\nThe proclamation in which Mr. Lincoln assured the seceding states that\r\nslavery should not be disturbed provided the insurgents laid down\r\ntheir arms by the 1st of January, 1863, proves that Mr. Lincoln is\r\nnot entitled to the very great credit that is given him for signing\r\nthe Emancipation Act. Mr. Lincoln was never a rabid abolitionist, and\r\nwas an eleventh hour man, at that; he bore none of the brunt of the\r\npioneers’ fight; he could show no such scars as Wendell Phillips and\r\nLloyd Garrison and Cassius M. Clay carried; he never ran the risk of\r\nbecoming a martyr, like Lovejoy; he stood aside, a good Whig, until\r\nthe abolition movement was sweeping his own section, and then he fell\r\ninto line with it like a practical, sensible, adjustable politician. He\r\nhimself joked about the manner in which Thaddeus Stevens, Benjamin Wade\r\nand Charles Sumner nagged at him from week to week, and month to month,\r\nbecause of his luke-warmness in the matter of emancipation. Of and\r\nconcerning those three more rabid abolitionists, Mr. Lincoln told his\r\nsomewhat celebrated anecdote of the little Sunday School boy and those\r\n“same three damn fellows, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego.”\r\n\r\nNot until it became a military necessity to do it, did Mr. Lincoln\r\nsign the Emancipation Act. Therefore, his hand having been forced\r\nby military policy rather than by the dictates of philanthropy, it\r\ndoes not seem just to class him with the crusaders of the abolition\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIf he meant what he said in his famous letter to Alexander H. Stephens,\r\nif he meant what he said even in his last inaugural,—to say nothing\r\nof the first,—it was never Lincoln’s intention to go farther than to\r\ncombat the South in her efforts to extend slavery into the free states\r\nand territories.\r\n\r\nIn guiding the non-seceding states through the perils of civil strife,\r\nMr. Lincoln’s position was never so difficult as was that of Mazarin,\r\nnor that of Richelieu; not so difficult as that of Cromwell; not so\r\ndifficult as that of William the Silent, or William of Orange, and very\r\nmuch less difficult than that of the younger Pitt,-“the pilot that\r\nweathered the storm” of the revolutionary and Napoleonic wars. Mr.\r\nLincoln’s achievements as chief magistrate and as a statesman certainly\r\ndo not outrank those of George Washington, nor even those of Cavour,\r\nto whom modern Italy owes her existence; nor of Bismarck, creator of\r\nthe German Empire. _Finally, it should be remembered that the South was\r\ncombating the Spirit of the Age and the Conscience of Mankind._ This\r\nfact lightened Mr. Lincoln’s task, immensely.\r\n\r\nHow do the people of the South feel toward Lincoln? Kindly. We\r\nhonor his memory. We think that he was broad-minded, free from\r\nvindictiveness, free from sectionalism, free from class-hatred. We\r\nthink he was a strong man, a sagacious man, and a very determined man.\r\nWe have always regarded his assassination as the worst blow the South\r\ngot after Appomattox. We think that he, alone, could have stemmed the\r\ntorrent of sectional hatred, and could have worked out a simple plan of\r\nrestoring the seceding states to the Union which would have reunited\r\nthe family without that carnival of debauchery and crime known as the\r\n“Reconstruction period.”\r\n\r\nWe think that the man who made the appeal to the South which he made\r\nin his first inaugural, and the man who at Gettysburg, soon after\r\nthe battle, praised the courage of the troops who made the effort to\r\nstorm such heights as those, and who on the night of Lee’s surrender\r\ncalled upon the bands to play “Dixie,” was not a bitter partizan of the\r\nThaddeus Stevens stripe, who, after the guns had been stacked and the\r\nflags furled, would have used all of the tremendous and irresistible\r\npower of the Federal Government to humiliate, outrage, despoil and\r\ndrive to desperation a people who were already in the dust.\r\n\r\nIt is not true that Mr. Lincoln offered generous terms to the South\r\nat the Hampton Roads Conference. He did not say to the Confederate\r\nCommissioners, “Write the word ‘_Union_’ first and you may write\r\nwhatever you please after that.”\r\n\r\nIt is not true that he offered payment for the slaves.\r\n\r\nThe official reports made to both Governments, as well as Mr. Stephens’\r\nstory of the celebrated Conference, conclusively prove that Mr.\r\nLincoln demanded the unconditional surrender of the Confederacy as a\r\npreliminary to any discussion of terms.\r\n\r\nIn fact, at the close of the Conference of four hours, Mr. R. M. T.\r\nHunter, one of the Confederate Commissioners, feelingly complained of\r\nthe harshness and humiliation involved in the “unconditional surrender”\r\ndemanded of the seceding states.\r\n\r\nMr. Lincoln declined to commit himself, _officially_, to the\r\nproposition that the South, by laying down her arms and submitting to\r\nthe restoration of the national authority throughout her limits, could\r\nresume her former relations to the Government. _Personally_, he thought\r\nshe could. He refused _officially_ to commit himself on the subject of\r\npaying the slave-owners for their slaves. _Personally_, he was willing\r\nto be taxed for that purpose, and he _believed_ that the Northern\r\npeople held the same views. He knew of some who favored a Congressional\r\nappropriation of $400,000,000 for that purpose. But give any pledges?\r\nOh, no. The Confederacy must first abolish itself,—_then_ there would\r\nbe a discussion of terms!\r\n\r\nFort Fisher, North Carolina, had recently fallen; the Confederacy was\r\nreeling under the shock of repeated disaster, the thin battle lines of\r\nthe Gray were almost exhausted,—and Mr. Lincoln was now certain that\r\nsecession was doomed.\r\n\r\nIn the “Recollections” of J. R. Gilmore, there is a curious account\r\nof an informal mission undertaken by himself and Col. J. F. Jaquess\r\nfor the purpose of ending the war. According to Gilmore, he went to\r\nWashington, had an interview with Mr. Lincoln, and drew from him a\r\nstatement of the terms which he was willing to offer the Confederate\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe gist of his several propositions was that the Confederacy should\r\ndissolve, the armies disband, the seceding states acknowledge national\r\nauthority and come back into Congress with their representatives, that\r\nslavery should be abolished and that $500,000,000 be paid the South for\r\nthe slaves. This was in June 1864.\r\n\r\nGilmore and Colonel Jaquess were given passage through the lines,\r\nwent to Richmond and saw Mr. Davis. After listening to the unofficial\r\nproposals of the self-appointed envoys, Mr. Davis declared that the\r\nSouth was not struggling to maintain slavery, but to make good “_our\r\nright to govern ourselves_.”\r\n\r\nAs the terms offered took away this fundamental right from the South,\r\nMr. Davis declined to treat.\r\n\r\nHow hopeless, at that time, must have seemed the cause for which\r\nJefferson Davis stood! How eternally assured that of Mr. Lincoln!\r\nYet, see how old Father Time works his miracles,—the Jefferson Davis\r\nprinciple has risen from the ashes, a very Phoenix of life immortal.\r\nThe Lincoln position has been abandoned by the Party which made him\r\nits first President. The cause of Home Rule is stronger throughout the\r\nworld than when the fugitive President of the broken Confederacy faced\r\nhis official family, at its last Cabinet meeting, in the village of\r\nWashington, Georgia, and asked, despairingly, “_Is it all over?_”\r\n\r\nThe hateful Amendments, which struck so foul and cruel a blow at “our\r\nright to govern ourselves,” are now nothing more than monuments reared\r\nby political partisans to their own vindictive passions. The better\r\nelement throughout the North would be glad to forget them. They have\r\nbeen distorted by the Federal Judiciary and have proven to be a curse\r\nto the whole country, in that they are the refuge of the corporations\r\nwhich plunder the people.\r\n\r\nRepublican leaders look on, acquiescent, while state after state that\r\nseceded from the Union puts into practice the principle for which the\r\nSouth fought in the Civil War,—the right to regulate our own domestic\r\nconcerns.\r\n\r\nA Republican President has made an Ex-Confederate soldier the official\r\nhead of the military establishment of the United States; a Republican\r\nPresident has stood his ground against negro resentment upon the\r\nproposition that the South may disfranchise the negroes if she likes; a\r\nRepublican President-elect manfully held the same position throughout a\r\nheated campaign in which niggerites and Bryanites assaulted both Taft\r\nand Roosevelt because of this pro-Southern attitude.\r\n\r\n“_We are fighting, not for slavery, but for the right to govern\r\nourselves._” So said our President; so said our Statesmen; so said our\r\nsoldiers; so said our civilians. And today we are vindicated.\r\n\r\nThe insanest war in history, as one studies it, is seen to have been\r\nfought for a principle which both sides now admit to have been right,\r\nand which Mr. Lincoln repeatedly and most earnestly declared was right,\r\nbefore a shot was fired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy Mr. Bryan Can Never Be President\r\n\r\nIn 1896, it cost the Republicans six million dollars to defeat Bryan;\r\nin 1900, it cost them four millions; in 1908, they “beat him to a\r\nfrazzle” with less than two millions.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, every chance was in his favor; he was young, handsome,\r\nmagnetic, eloquent, without a stain on his record. In the general\r\nenthusiasm aroused by his “crown-of-thorns, cross-of-gold” speech,\r\npeople did not give heed to the craftiness and selfishness of the\r\nBland delegate who used Bland’s name as a stalking horse to get the\r\nnomination for himself. For twenty years Richard P. Bland had labored\r\nfor Bi-metallism. He had won the fight by sheer bulldog pluck. The\r\nBland-Allison act of 1878 was a Bland triumph. The Sherman law of 1890\r\nwas a Bland victory, for Sherman himself said it must be passed to head\r\noff a free-coinage act. When the Congress of 1892 convened, the Bland\r\nforces had an overwhelming majority. Why then could we not make a law\r\nrestoring the white metal to its constitutional place as the equal\r\nof gold? Because, in the contest for the Speakership, the Northern\r\nCongressmen _got control of the Committees as an exchange for the\r\noffice of Speaker_.\r\n\r\nBut the tide of public feeling in favor of “Constitutional money” kept\r\non rising, and there is no doubt whatever that a majority of our people\r\nin 1896, favored Bi-metallism. But Bryan, cunning and ambitious, used\r\nhis opportunities as a Bland delegate to undermine Bland, and at the\r\npsychological moment treated Bland to what Garfield had treated Sherman.\r\n\r\nWhat had Bryan done for Bi-metallism? Nothing. He did not even\r\nunderstand the true meaning of it. As for Bland, he had fought the\r\nbattle of “Constitutional money” while Bryan was at school, and when,\r\nin the hour of Silver’s triumph, the hero of its struggle was cast\r\naside by his ungrateful party, it broke the old man’s heart and he died.\r\n\r\nWhen I think of the long series of years during which Mr. Bland was the\r\nunflinching, untiring leader of the forces of Bi-metallism, and when I\r\nthink of the very substantial fruits of his labors, the manner in which\r\nBryan and the Democratic party flung him aside—the old horse turned\r\nout to graze till he should drop—seems to me to be one of the most\r\nconvincing illustrations of the fact that “_politics is hell_.”\r\n\r\nHaving captured the Democratic nomination, Bryan turned his attention\r\nto the Populists. They had proved that they could poll nearly two\r\nmillion votes. Bryan wanted them. Through Allen of Nebraska and Jones\r\nof Arkansas he laid his plans to get them. By as foul a trick as ever\r\nwas played in American politics, the Populist Convention was inveigled\r\ninto giving its Presidential nomination to Bryan. Having got what\r\nhe sought, he broke the contract, turned a deaf ear to all appeals,\r\nunderrated the measure of Mid-road Populist resentment, invaded “the\r\nenemy’s country,” cherished the delusion that he could win New England,\r\nhung on to the impossible Sewall, and so lost the Presidency.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact that the Republicans had no hope of success, after the\r\naction of the Populist Convention, until Bryan himself adopted the\r\ninsane policy of making the race with two Vice-Presidential candidates\r\nswinging on to the ticket.\r\n\r\nIn that campaign, the whole money question was dwarfed to the\r\ndiscussion of “Free Silver.” The great issue of Constitutional,\r\nscientific Bi-metallism was shunted on to the spur track of Free\r\nSilver. In that campaign he lost the East and the North, irrevocably.\r\nInstead of making a strong, broad, easily understood plea for a\r\nrestoration of the financial system of Jefferson, of Madison, of\r\nMonroe, of Jackson, of Benton, of Calhoun, he selected that detail\r\nof the money question which was of the least consequence, which was\r\nthe most difficult to explain to the ordinary voter, and which,—on\r\naccount of the selfish interests of the Silver Kings—lent itself most\r\nfavorably to Republican assault.\r\n\r\nThis error was Bryan’s own folly, for the Greenbacker and the Populist\r\nhad already demonstrated the advantage of treating the question in the\r\nbroad, fundamental way. To this day, Mr. Bryan pays the penalty. To the\r\nbusiness world, of every section of the Union, he is known as the “Free\r\nSilver” crank, and the business world is dead against him.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, the Spanish war had temporarily engulfed economic questions.\r\nBryan was astute enough to feel this; consequently, he discovered a\r\nnew Paramount Issue. It was Imperialism. But Bryan was not the man to\r\nderive any benefit from it, for the simple reason that he was as much\r\nresponsible for it as the Republicans themselves. Tired of camp life\r\nat Tampa, Mr. Bryan hurried to Washington City, exerted his personal\r\ninfluence with certain Democratic Senators, and prevailed upon Senator\r\nClay and others to vote with the Republicans to ratify the Treaty of\r\nParis.\r\n\r\nAs our Imperialism grows out of this Treaty, Mr. Bryan’s political\r\ndishonesty in raising such an issue against the Republicans was so\r\nglaring that they had very much less trouble in defeating him in 1900\r\nthan they had had in 1896.\r\n\r\nThen came the ugly affair of the Bennett will; of Bryan’s acceptance of\r\ngifts of money aggregating $12,000; of his efforts to secure, secretly,\r\na legacy of $50,000; of his astonishing lack of delicacy in drawing\r\nup, in his home, a will for a doting old man who was Bryan’s guest; of\r\nhis mercenary persistence in his struggle against Bennett’s widow; of\r\nhis claim for a large fee as Executor of a will which he had drawn and\r\nwhich the courts had set aside.\r\n\r\nThen came the revelation that while appearing to the public as the\r\ndevoted, unselfish, patriotic champion of Free Silver, he had been in\r\nthe pay of the Silvre Kings all the time. _Then_ we could understand\r\nwhy he had narrowed the money question to that pitiful detail.\r\nMillionaire Silver Mine-owners, like Marcus Daly and William A. Clark,\r\ndidn’t care a rap about Constitutional money. What they wanted was the\r\npersonal profit to be gained by them in carrying fifty cents’ worth\r\nof the white metal to the U. S. Mints and having it turned into a\r\ndollar. Free Silver meant millions of dollars to these Silver Kings.\r\nTherefore they paid Bryan big prices to make speeches for Free Silver.\r\nAnd the Peerless orator stuck to his text. And when the Silver Kings\r\ndiscontinued the pay, Mr. Bryan discontinued the speeches.\r\n\r\nAfterwards came the campaign against Parker’s nomination in 1904.\r\nPretty much everything that could be said to prove that such a\r\nnomination would be a base betrayal of the Jeffersonian element of the\r\nDemocratic party, Bryan said. In Chicago, notably, he hired a hall,\r\ncollected the faithful around him, made an impassioned speech setting\r\nforth the shame of such a Ryan-Belmont candidacy as that of Parker, and\r\nsaid that a Democrat ought to be ready and willing to die rather than\r\nsubmit to such a surrender of principle as would be involved in the\r\nnomination of Parker.\r\n\r\nSimilar heroic declarations Mr. Bryan made against the Clevelandites,\r\nthe Wall Street element of his party, the undemocratic advocates of the\r\nBritish gold standard which had chained the world to London. In his\r\nbook, in his paper, in his speeches,—particularly at Birmingham,—he\r\nvowed that he would never support a gold standard candidate and that he\r\nwould quit the Democrats if the party adopted a gold standard platform.\r\n\r\n“_Is thy servant a dog that he should do this thing?_” That was the\r\ntone of Bryan’s indignant reply whenever he was asked whether he would\r\nfollow his party if it deserted its principles.\r\n\r\nAlas! The heroics sounded well—but where was the hero?\r\n\r\nWe admit that Bryan made a great fight against the Ryan-Belmont\r\nhirelings in the Democratic National Convention of 1904. His forensic\r\npowers are of a high order, and they were magnificently displayed in\r\nthat debate. But he wasn’t true grit, wasn’t dead game,—did not prove\r\nhimself a thoroughbred. No, he is not the kind of bird that dies in the\r\ncock-pit; he showed the “dominecker.”\r\n\r\nHad he met Parker’s gold telegram with a defiant, “I accept the\r\nchallenge! Let those who are true to Democratic principles follow me\r\nout of this Convention!” he would have smashed the Ryan-Belmont slate,\r\nforced Parker out of the lists, won the nomination for himself, and\r\n_might_ have been President.\r\n\r\nBut he sunk the popular hero into the party hack,—let them put the\r\nharness on, hitch him up and drive him in a direction that his record,\r\nhis vows and his convictions made it a disgrace for him to travel.\r\n\r\nThen came the speeches in which he said as much in favor of Parker as\r\nhe had said against him,—and Parker had not changed a bit. The change\r\nwas _there_, and it was vast,—but it was in Bryan.\r\n\r\nThen came the swing backwards to radicalism again. Bryan spoke at\r\nthe Jefferson Day banquet in Chicago in 1906 and said that the time\r\nhad come for the Democratic party to declare itself in favor of the\r\nGovernment Ownership of the railroads. He advanced the proposition that\r\nthe states should own the local lines while Uncle Sam ran the trunk\r\nlines. This absurd plan was the burden of the Bryan talk and Bryan\r\neditorials for more than a year,—long enough for the whole country to\r\nrealize what an impractical “statesman” he is. So ludicrous a “break”\r\nqueered him still further with the men of the business world, and told\r\nheavily against him in the campaign of this year.\r\n\r\nThen, after his home-coming speech in Madison Square Garden, he made\r\nhis final declaration in favor of Government Ownership. Having toured\r\nEurope and witnessed the advantages of State-owned public utilities,\r\nhis own convictions in favor of that system had been strengthened.\r\n\r\nBut Democratic editors and politicians raised a Bourbon outcry against\r\nGovernment Ownership, and Bryan, after shuffling about awhile, took to\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\nThen he fell in love with the Initiative and Referendum. Mightily\r\nin favor of giving Direct Legislation to the people was Bryan. But\r\nagain the Bourbons raised their hands in holy horror, and again Bryan\r\nflunked. “Willing to teach the children that the earth is flat, or that\r\nit is round, whichever a majority of the School Board prefer”;—that’s\r\nthe kind of pedagogue partisan politics has made out of W. J. B.\r\n\r\nThen we heard him endorse Roosevelt, and agree with the President\r\nthat Congress ought to pay the campaign expenses of the two old\r\ntwins,—Chang and Eng,—and that honest bankers should be punished\r\nfor crimes _they_ didn’t commit, and that the Government should not\r\nestablish Postal savings banks but should perpetuate the National banks!\r\n\r\nThen we saw him dictate the Denver platform which is more Hamiltonian\r\nthan the Parker platform of 1904, and less favorable to the masses\r\nthan the platform of Mr. Taft. We saw him choose a Standard Oil tool\r\nfor the Chairmanship of his Finance Committee; we saw the Tobacco\r\nrepresented on the same Committee; we saw him courting David B. Hill,\r\nJudge Parker, Charles Murphy, Pat McCarren and “Fingy” Conners; we\r\nsaw him yoke up with the liquor interests in Maine, Indiana and Ohio;\r\nwe saw him change his whole political creed until Ryan, Belmont,\r\nHarriman and Rockefeller had nothing to fear from him, and we saw him\r\nconduct a campaign in which he stood for no distinct vital _democratic\r\nprinciple_, whatever. Then we saw him dodge when the President asked\r\nhim, through the newspapers, how he stood on the Pearre bill which\r\nseeks to have Congress declare that a man’s business is not entitled to\r\nthe same protection as his property. Impaled on that point, Bryan could\r\ndo nothing but squirm.\r\n\r\nThen indeed, he lost out with level-headed men of all parties.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nBurdened with the record of his own instability, Bryan this year lost,\r\npractically, everything excepting the South. True, he got Nevada (two\r\nelectoral votes,) and Colorado (five votes,) and Nebraska, (eight\r\nvotes,) but this state he carried by making a piteous, tearful personal\r\nappeal,—and even then he got only a plurality, not a majority, and ran\r\nfar behind the Democratic State ticket; but the West has repudiated\r\nhim, just as the South and East have done.\r\n\r\nIt would not be worth while to dwell upon the humiliation of that\r\npolitical serfdom which kept the South in the Bryan column.\r\n\r\nThe South voted for Bryan, _and is glad he wasn’t elected_. Everybody,\r\nwho knows anything, knows _that_. The fact ought to be able to\r\npenetrate the conceit of Bryan himself.\r\n\r\nBut is the fact important? It _is_, for its first consequence will be\r\nthe elimination of Bryan, and its second will be the restoration of the\r\nSouth to her historic position in the Republic. It is the beginning of\r\nSouthern self-assertion; the end of her political nullity.\r\n\r\nNever again can Mr. Bryan hope to secure the support of the South.\r\nHis record makes it impossible for her delegates to acquiesce in his\r\nnomination.\r\n\r\nThis being so, the Bryanites of other sections will recognize the folly\r\nof nominating him—for without the Solid South no Democrat can hope to\r\nwin the Presidency.\r\n\r\nWhen Bryan adopted that policy of Africanizing the Democratic party,\r\nhe drove nails into his political coffin. The facts were not aired by\r\nthe Southern papers during the campaign, but Bryan will hear from them\r\nwhen he bobs up serenely and goes after a fourth nomination. Ever since\r\nthe Civil War, the Democratic party in the South has claimed to be the\r\nwhite man’s party. Because it was feared that a division of the whites\r\ninto two parties would result in giving to the negroes the balance of\r\npower, the Southern people have allowed the Democracy of other sections\r\nto legislate against our interests, to ignore our industrial existence,\r\nto rob our producers under forms of law, to foist upon us candidates\r\nnot of our choosing, and platforms which we detested.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats of other sections were permitted to treat us as though we\r\nbelonged to them, _because_ we feared to divide into two competitive\r\nwhite parties,—feared Negro Domination.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the South has been struggling to establish White\r\nSupremacy, and to diminish the political importance of the negro.\r\n\r\nYet in this campaign of 1908 we heard Bryan’s lieutenant, Henry\r\nWatterson, declare that _the time had come for the Negroes to divide\r\nand thus increase their political importance_. The whole Bryanite\r\ncampaign was pitched to that key. “The time has come to increase the\r\npolitical importance of the negro!”\r\n\r\nIn other words, the Bryanites deserted the Democratic position on the\r\nnegro question, and went over to the Thad Stevens-Sumner position, at\r\nthe very time that the Republicans, led by Roosevelt and Taft, were\r\ncoming over to the Southern view. We saw Bryan flirting with the negro\r\nleaders, and seeking to make a Democratic asset out of the resentment\r\nwhich they felt because of Roosevelt’s pro-Southern position on the\r\nmatter of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. We likewise saw Mr.\r\nBryan witness with seeming approval, the parade of negro clubs on whose\r\nbanners were displayed extracts from Foraker’s speeches denouncing\r\nthe President for his dismissal from the army of the black brutes who\r\non their way to Brownsville insolently declared “When we get there\r\nall the women will look alike to us, white, black and Mexican”; and\r\nwho put a climax to a series of outrages and threats by shooting up\r\nthe town—killing one man at his own gate, bringing down the Chief of\r\npolice with a shattered arm, riddling hotel and private houses with\r\nbullets; and terrorizing men, women and children.\r\n\r\nYes, we saw Bryan receiving negro delegations who came to confer with\r\nhim about the negro soldiers; we saw the colored delegations cordially\r\nmet and hospitably entertained; and we heard them say, that they were\r\nperfectly satisfied with the assurances which Mr. Bryan had given\r\nthem. They circulated, by the hundred thousand, a letter, bearing\r\nthe names of the most prominent negroes of the land, in which the\r\nstatement occurs that _“We have been in communication with Mr. Bryan\r\nfor weeks and have received satisfactory assurances from him” as to_\r\nPATRONAGE, RECOGNITION, AND THE AMENDMENTS.\r\n\r\nMr. Bryan must have been aware of the fact that this circular letter\r\nwas being used in his behalf. It is highly probable that his Campaign\r\nCommittee furnished the money which paid for the printing and the\r\nmailing of it; and there is no doubt that the negro speakers who went\r\nabout asking for votes for Bryan, because of Brownsville and because of\r\nthe Southern Disfranchisement laws, were paid by the Bryanite Committee.\r\n\r\nIt would have been a calamity to the country had the desperate tactics\r\nof the Bryanites met with success. The impression would have been made\r\nthat the negro vote elected him, and there is no telling how far that\r\nwould have influenced Mr. Bryan in his official dealings with the negro\r\nleaders.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that he earnestly supported the candidacy of a negro\r\nagainst a white man, in Nebraska. The negro got the office. It is said\r\nthat no such thing had occurred in Nebraska before.\r\n\r\nHe educated his daughter and one of his sons at the Social Equality\r\n“University of Nebraska,” and another of his sons is a student there\r\nnow. To this Social Equality College, Mr. Bryan annually donates two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars.\r\n\r\nHe has never uttered a word against the mixed schools of Nebraska\r\nwherein the negro children are educated on terms of Social Equality\r\nwith the whites. He has never condemned the intermarriage of blacks and\r\nwhites. There is no law against it in Nebraska, and miscegenation is\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nBorn and reared in Illinois, Mr. Bryan holds the anti-Southern view\r\nof the race question. By birth, education and environment, he got the\r\nbelief that Social Equality is right, and he practices what he believes\r\nwhen he sends his children to be educated along with the negroes.\r\n\r\nHow can the South, knowing these things _as she now does_, ever support\r\nBryan again? To do so would be to reverse her position on that question\r\nwhich to her is the most important of all. During the heat of the\r\ncampaign, Southern editors who knew of these things kept mum. It will\r\nnot be so when Bryan seeks the fourth nomination.\r\n\r\nIn the next national convention of the Democratic party, the South will\r\nnot be run over as the Bryanites ran over her at Denver.\r\n\r\nIf she demands the Vice-Presidency in 1912, it won’t go to the attorney\r\nof the Brewers’ Combine of Indiana. If Lincoln’s name should again be\r\nlugged into the Convention, it will again be honored, but when the\r\nname of Robert E. Lee is mentioned it will not be hooted and hissed.\r\nDemocrats of the other sections may not be pleased by the attitude of\r\nSouthern delegations, but we venture the prediction that no Haskell\r\nbrass-bands will insult them by tauntingly playing, “_Marching thro’\r\nGeorgia_.”\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nBut it is not such a misfortune to Mr. Bryan that he will never be\r\nPresident. Several millions of very respectable men share that lot with\r\nhim. He is rich,—the only man that ever got rich doing reform work. In\r\nBryan’s case, indeed, there has been no reform work,—just floods of\r\ntalk about it.\r\n\r\nHe has friends everywhere, has no personal enemies, is of sanguine\r\ntemperament, is rounding out into a comfortable fatness, has no bad\r\nhabits, no gentlemanly vices, and is so unconsciously self-righteous in\r\nall that he does that he fails to realize what bad taste he displays\r\nwhen he introduces his wife’s name into a public speech and sets forth\r\nat length her qualifications for the position of “First Lady in the\r\nland.”\r\n\r\nPersonally, we bear Mr. Bryan no ill will and wish him no harm, but\r\nit is our deliberate opinion that his inordinate ambition for office\r\nand his mistakes as a leader have done more immense injury to the\r\ncause of reform. He destroyed the Populist party, he has wrecked the\r\nDemocratic party, he has driven thousands of Conservative men into the\r\nRepublican ranks, and thousands of radical Democrats and Populists to\r\nthe Socialists.\r\n\r\nHis career has been rich in substantial rewards to Mr. Bryan himself,\r\nbut, on the whole, it has been the bane of Jeffersonian democracy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeign Missions\r\n\r\n\r\nThe action of the South Georgia Conference of the Methodist Church in\r\nvoting $65,000 to Foreign Missions, last week, moves the _Jeffersonian_\r\nto say another word upon that subject.\r\n\r\nSome time ago, the New York _World_ published a statement to the effect\r\nthat, out of every ninety dollars contributed in this country to the\r\nForeign Mission fund, only one dollar reached the heathen. This is a\r\nsweeping arraignment of the honesty and efficiency of the management of\r\nthe funds which we are not prepared to indorse.\r\n\r\nOur criticism follows a different line. The question raised by the\r\n_Jeffersonian_ is this,—_What moral right have American Christians to\r\nleave their own poor_,—UNFED, UNCLOTHED AND UNREDEEMED,—_and\r\nto drain off into foreign lands millions upon millions of American\r\ndollars to feed and clothe and redeem the poor of those foreign lands?_\r\n\r\nIt is a most serious question, Brother.\r\n\r\nYou tell us, as per formula, that we are commanded to carry the Gospel\r\nto all the world. Granted. But where are we commanded to leave our own\r\npoverty-stricken wretches to die like poisoned rats in their holes,\r\nwhile we relieve the physical distress of the Chinese?\r\n\r\nWhat moral right have we to deny the beggar at our gate, and to heed\r\nthe plaint of the Chinese beggar?\r\n\r\nOne of our private correspondents a little while ago, wrote us that a\r\ncertain preacher, whose attention he called to our statements on this\r\nsubject, declared that said statements “_were misleading_.”\r\n\r\nWherein? They could not _mislead_. If what we have said about our\r\nforeign missionaries furnishing food, clothing, medicine, fuel, etc.,\r\nto foreign “converts” is the truth, our people are entitled to know it.\r\n\r\nIf our statements are false, _we_ want to know it.\r\n\r\nA very prominent and able Baptist minister,—who has long been a\r\nlaborer in the Foreign Missions field,—and a well-known Methodist\r\nminister, who has been similarly engaged, _are responsible for the\r\nstatements made by the Jeffersonian_.\r\n\r\nOne of these noble men said that the most discouraging thing about the\r\nForeign Missions work was, that _when the rations to the “converts”\r\nwere cut off, the convert lost interest in the Christian faith_.\r\n\r\nWhat words could we employ that would arraign the system more severely?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe idea of the _Jeffersonian_ is that each nation of the world should\r\ntake care of its own poor. We are not responsible for pauperism, vice\r\nand crime in China. There is no more reason why we should be taxed for\r\n_contributions to maintain a commissary_ in Pekin or Hong Kong than in\r\nParis, Berlin or London. We leave to the French the task of providing\r\nfor the Parisian poor; we don’t think of supplying food, raiment and\r\nmedicine to Berlin paupers; and we consider it the duty of the English\r\nto provide for London outcasts. Why, then should we virtually coerce\r\nour American Christians into sending money to heathen lands for the\r\npurpose of relieving the physical distress of the heathen?\r\n\r\nWhile penning this editorial, it occurred to us to glance at a New York\r\nexchange, for the purpose of noting _some contemporaneous instance of\r\nstarvation, or of suicide because of hunger and lack of employment_.\r\nThe newspapers of the North have been gruesomely full of many ghastly\r\nincidents of that kind.\r\n\r\nYes, _there it was_, page 3, of the N. Y. Evening Journal, of December\r\n4th, 1908.\r\n\r\nA white woman, sick and starving, and with a babe at her breast, fell\r\nexhausted on Fifth Avenue,—the home-street of the richest men the\r\nworld has ever known. All of them are Christians. When prosecuted for\r\ntheir criminal methods of taking other people’s property away from\r\nthem, they blandly perjure themselves, escape the feeble clutches\r\nof the law, turn up serenely at church, next Sunday, and contribute\r\nhandsomely to Foreign Missions.\r\n\r\nThe woman who fell starving, on the street where these richest of men\r\nlive, was named Mrs. Mary Schrumm. She was young, thinly dressed, and\r\n_had not tasted food for two days. The child was nearly famished,\r\nalmost frozen and had acute bronchitis._ Her husband was out of work;\r\nan old woman with whom she had found shelter had been given notice to\r\nvacate; and Mrs. Schrumm had gone into the streets to seek refuge in\r\nsome one of the charitable institutions. _She had been turned away from\r\neach of these that she could reach. She had begged that her babe, at\r\nleast, might be taken in. No; the babe was sick, and_ THEY COULD\r\nNOT TAKE IN A SICK CHILD!\r\n\r\nGod! And we talk about _what the heathen need! The hardest-hearted\r\nheathen that Jehovah ever made are some of the seared hypocrites who\r\ncall themselves Christians._\r\n\r\nDenied everywhere, poor Mrs. Schrumm wandered about the streets, in the\r\nbitterly cold wind, until she fell, completely tired out.\r\n\r\n_Then_, indeed, charity had to sit up and take notice. The starving\r\nwoman was put into an ambulance, and carried to a hospital. _She_ will\r\nprobably recover; her child will probably die.\r\n\r\nThen, _what moral right_ have you to let such unfortunates as these\r\n_fall starving in_ YOUR _streets_, while you are sending\r\n_hundreds of millions of dollars abroad to feed, clothe, physic and\r\nmake fires for the hungry, “thinly clad,” sick and shivering Chinese_?\r\n\r\nDoesn’t your own “mother wit” tell you that _Foreign Missions could\r\nnot consume such vast sums of money_, IF THE MISSIONARIES LIMITED\r\nTHEMSELVES TO PREACHING THE GOSPEL!\r\n\r\nPut on your think cap, son.\r\n\r\nIn the New York _World_ of December 5, 1908, is reported the case of\r\nGeorge Schulze who shot himself to death, in spite of the pleadings of\r\nhis wife and children, because he was out of work, had tried in vain to\r\nsecure employment and was in despair.\r\n\r\nIf these were not typical cases, we would not dwell upon them. But they\r\n_are_ typical cases, _and you know it_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTreasure Trove\r\n\r\n\r\nThe writer of the ballad which the Jeffersonian presents to its readers\r\nthis month was Clara V. Dargan. She was born near Winnsboro, S. C., the\r\ndaughter of Dr. K. S. Dargan, descendant of an old Virginia family of\r\nthe highest standing. Her mother was a native Charlestonian of Huguenot\r\nblood, and from her the poetess inherited vivacity, social charm and a\r\nlove for romance. The Dargan family was wealthy, but lost everything by\r\nthe war. Miss Dargan published many poems and short prose stories in\r\nthe periodicals of the time. In 1863, she was the literary editor of\r\nthe “Edgefield Advertiser.”\r\n\r\nOne of her stories, “Philip, My Son,” was considered by so good an\r\nauthority as Henry Timrod to be equal to any story published in\r\n“Blackwood’s.”\r\n\r\n“Jean to Jamie” seems to us almost the perfection of a poem of that\r\nclass. The pathos of it is so genuine, so unobtrusive and so deep that\r\none feels, instinctively, that the lines of the poem ran from the heart\r\nof one who had suffered. Henry Timrod said of it, “The verse flows with\r\nthe softness of a woman’s tears.” The poem, published in 1866, has long\r\nsince been lost to current literature. Believing it to be a treasure\r\nthat ought to be recovered, we reproduce it.\r\n\r\n\r\nJean to Jamie\r\n\r\n    What do you think now, Jamie,\r\n      What do you think now?\r\n    ’Tis many a long year since we parted;\r\n    Do you still believe Jean honest-hearted—\r\n      Do you think so now?\r\n\r\n    You did think so once, Jamie,\r\n      In the blithe spring-time;\r\n    “There’s never a star in the blue sky\r\n    That’s half sae true as my Jamie,” quo’ I—\r\n      Do you mind the time?\r\n\r\n    We were happy then, Jamie,\r\n      Too happy, I fear;\r\n    Sae we kissed farewell at the cottage door—\r\n    I never hae seen you since at that door\r\n      This many a year.\r\n\r\n    For they told you lies, Jamie;\r\n      You believed them a’!\r\n    You, who had promised to trust me true\r\n    Before the whole world—what did you do?\r\n      You believed them a’!\r\n\r\n    When they called you fause, Jamie,\r\n      And argued it sair,\r\n    I flashed wi’ anger—I kindled wi’ scorn,\r\n    Less at you than at them; I was sae lorn,\r\n      I couldna do mair.\r\n\r\n    After a bit while, Jamie,—\r\n      After a while,\r\n    I heard a’ the cruel words you had said—\r\n    The cruel, hard words; sae I bowed my head—\r\n      Na tear—na smile—\r\n\r\n    And you took your letters, Jamie,\r\n      Gathered them a’,\r\n    And burnt them one by one in the fire,\r\n    And watched the bright blaze leaping higher—\r\n      Burnt ringlet and a’!\r\n\r\n    Then back to the world, Jamie,\r\n      Laughing went I;\r\n    There ne’er was a merrier laugh than mine;\r\n    What foot could outdance me—what eye outshine?\r\n      “Puir fool!” laughed I.\r\n\r\n    But I’m weary of mirth, Jamie,\r\n      ’Tis hollowness a’;\r\n    And in these long years sin’ we were parted,\r\n    I fear I’m growing aye colder-hearted\r\n      Than you thought ava!\r\n\r\n    I hae many lovers, Jamie,\r\n      But I dinna care;\r\n    I canna abide a’ the nonsense they speak—\r\n    Yet I’d go on my knees o’er Arran’s gray peak\r\n      To see thee ance mair!\r\n\r\n    I long for you back, Jamie,\r\n      But that canna be;\r\n    I sit all alone by the ingle at e’en,\r\n    And think o’ those sad words: “It might have been”—\r\n      Yet never can be!\r\n\r\n    D’ye think o’ the past, Jamie?\r\n      D’ye think o’ it now?\r\n    ’Twad be a bit comfort to know that ye did—\r\n    Oh, sair, would I greet to know that ye did,\r\n      My dear, dear Jamie!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Passing of Lucy and Rollo\r\n\r\n\r\nGentle reader, did you ever steep your mind in one of those Sunday\r\nSchool hooks which were in circulation previous to our Civil War? If\r\nnot, ransack your grandmother’s garret until you find a specimen of\r\nthat Arcadian literature.\r\n\r\nThe little boy in those blessed books never quarrelled, never had a\r\nfight, never had dirty hands, and would have been inexpressibly shocked\r\nhad he made a conversational slip in grammar. He was an intolerable\r\nangel in breeches—was this little boy of the Sunday school book.\r\n_He_ couldn’t “talk back,” nor handle slang, nor throw rocks, nor\r\nskin-the-cat, nor ride the billy-goat, nor tie things to a dog’s tail,\r\nnor put a pin in a chair for somebody to sit on. If the Bad Boy hit him\r\nin the stomach, he wept meekly, quoted a text, and went home to his\r\nmamma.\r\n\r\nIn common conversation, the language of this Good Boy was drawn from\r\nwells of English undefiled. Erasmus never used choicer words; and\r\nChesterfield was not more perfect in manners, than was this detestable\r\nGood Boy.\r\n\r\nAmong youths of his own age, he was a miniature Socrates, washed and\r\notherwise purified. Wisdom oozed from him in hateful streams. The\r\nsagacity of sages sat on him with uncanny ease.\r\n\r\nWhen a grown man spoke to this Good Boy, the G. B. never replied until\r\nhe had lifted his right hand and ejaculated “Oh, Sir!” After the salute\r\nand the “Oh, Sir,” came the response, which always did infinite credit\r\nto the manners, mind and heart of this outrageously Good Boy.\r\n\r\nLife was an easy-going affair to the G. B. All things came his way.\r\nHe was virtuous and he was happy. Nothing ever occurred to soil his\r\nclothes or tangle his hair. His nose never bled, he never bit his\r\ntongue, never struck his funny-bone, never mashed his thumb with the\r\nhammer, never had his drink to go the wrong way. He was never drowned\r\nwhile bathing in the pond, for the simple reason that he didn’t “go\r\nin” on the Sabbath. The Bad Boy “went in washing” on Sunday and was\r\ndrowned, as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nDaniel in the lion’s den was not safer amid the perils than was the\r\nGood Boy among the ills which are incident to boyhood. Past vicious\r\nbulls and snappish curs he walked serene and unharmed. Neither his gun,\r\nnor his pony ever kicked him; neither the wasp, nor the bee, nor the\r\nyellow-jacket ventured to sting him; nettles avoided his bare feet; no\r\nboil came to afflict his nose, nor stye to distort his eye. No limb\r\nof a tree ever broke under _him_, and gave him a nasty fall. He never\r\ntumbled into the creek, nor snagged his “pants,” nor sprained his\r\nankle, nor cut his finger, nor bumped his head, nor walked against the\r\nedge of the door at night.\r\n\r\nNothing could happen to this insufferable Good Boy—nothing bad, I\r\nmean. _His_ shoes never blistered his heels, his hat never blew away,\r\nhe never lost his hand-kerchief, never had a stone-bruise, never missed\r\nhis lessons, never soiled his book, never played truant, and never ate\r\nanything which caused him to clap both hands to a certain place in\r\nfront while he doubled up and howled.\r\n\r\nOh, a pink of perfection was this odious boy of the ante-bellum Sunday\r\nSchool books.\r\n\r\nAnd next to him in comprehensive unbearableness was the little girl who\r\nwas the counterpart of this little boy.\r\n\r\nHer name was Lucy. Or, perhaps, Marielle. Or, for the sake of variety,\r\nLucretia.\r\n\r\nAnd what a portentous proposition in pantalettes she was, to be sure!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Rollo, Lucy and Mariette went Together.”]\r\n\r\nShe talked just as exquisitely as did the Good Boy. Her selection of\r\nwords was artistic, and her grammar immaculate. If William Pitt’s\r\nnatural style was that of the “State Paper,” the colloquial standard of\r\nLucy, Lucretia and Marielle was that of Madame de Stael.\r\n\r\nShe walked with primness; if she ran at all, it was with dignity; she\r\ndid not giggle, did not romp, never made a mud pie, never pinched the\r\nGood Boy, and was such a formidable little thing, generally, that\r\neven the Bad Boy never snatched her bonnet. Such a thought as that of\r\nstealing a kiss from her never entered the head of _any_ boy, good, bad\r\nor indifferent.\r\n\r\nThis unearthly girl always seemed an impossibility to me, after I\r\nbecame a grown-up, until I chanced to read about the daughter of John\r\nAdams, second President of these United States. Mr. Adams married a\r\nstately woman whose name was Abigail. What else could you expect, if\r\nnot that a girl born to John Adams and his wife, Abigail, would be a\r\ntremendous little girl from the very start? Her parents named _her_\r\nAbigail,—as an additional guarantee against chewing gum, coca-cola,\r\nslang, and tomboyishness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ABIGAIL ADAMS]\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen, we find Miss Abigail Adams writing about her\r\nfather as though he were some Sphinx or Pyramid that she had been\r\nviewing. Please go slow, as you read what this young lady says of her\r\nown papa:\r\n\r\n“I discover a thousand traits of softness, delicacy and sensibility\r\nin this excellent man’s character. How amiable, how respectable,\r\nhow worthy of every token of my attention has this conduct rendered\r\na parent, a father, to whom we feel due even a resignation of our\r\nopinions.”\r\n\r\nDid you ever? Just try to put yourself at the view-point of a girl who\r\ncould calmly sit down and analyze her father, as a naturalist would\r\ndisjoint a rare beetle. Think of a daughter referring to her father as\r\n“_this excellent man_,” and classing him “_respectable_”! Think of a\r\ndaughter dutifully conceding, in writing, that her dad is “worthy of my\r\nattention” and “even a resignation of our opinions.”\r\n\r\nAnd, after all, she jumped from the sublime to the ridiculous by\r\nmarrying a man named Smith!\r\n\r\nBut she has restored my confidence in the girl of the Sunday school\r\nbook. Lucy _did_ appear on this planet in the flesh; and when she\r\ntalked and wrote her style was that of little Abigail Adams. Marielle\r\nwas not an impossibility, nor was Lucretia. Even that obnoxious Good\r\nBoy was true to life—if John Adams’ description of his son John\r\nQuincy is not too highly colored by paternal pride. After reading said\r\npaternal description I can understand how it was that, while Henry\r\nClay made friends out of those whom he refused, John Quincy Adams made\r\nenemies by his manner in granting favors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut no matter how many Lucys and Rollos existed prior to our War\r\nbetween the States, it would be mighty hard to find a Lucy or a Rollo\r\nnow. Times have changed, manners have changed, types have changed.\r\nWhat is responsible for the bold-eyed girl—the girl of loose speech\r\nand loud manners? What is responsible for the irreverent boy—the boy\r\nof the cigarette and of _the look which undresses every handsome woman\r\nthat he meets_? These are the boys that greet girls with a “Hello!”\r\nand a leer that should offend. These are the girls who shout “Hello!”\r\nto the boys, and who lie prone by the side of young men during a\r\n“straw-ride” at night. Are all such maidens the daughters of mothers\r\nwho drink and gamble? Are all such youths the sons of men who have no\r\nmorals? By no means. Our whole social and industrial situation has\r\nchanged, and the people have changed with it.\r\n\r\nWould that I could believe that our Public System is guiltless in\r\nthis matter. Use your eyes as you pass a crowded academy and note the\r\nconditions which make against common decency—to say nothing of that\r\ndeference and respect with which every properly trained boy should\r\ntreat members of the other sex.\r\n\r\nBut there are causes deeper, more universal than the promiscuous mix-up\r\nin the Public Schools. The centripetal power of class legislation\r\nis drawing capital inward to the small centre of the Privileged. To\r\nthe masses is left a constantly smaller proportion of the nation’s\r\nannual production of wealth. In turn, this law-made and abnormal\r\ncondition of things over-crowds the cities. In fact, rural life has\r\nbecome so unattractive that the trend of population is _from the farm\r\nto the town_. Every village has its surplus—the men and boys, white\r\nand black, who have no visible means of support and who can not be\r\npersuaded to work. In every town is the girl who hardly knows why she’s\r\nthere,—but she’s there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “‘Oh! Look,’ cried Lucy.”]\r\n\r\nAnd the pace-that-kills in the Chicagos and New Yorks is faithfully\r\nrepresented, on a small scale, in each of our towns. Don’t all of us\r\nknow it? We do. But what is the remedy?\r\n\r\nThe temperance people believe that whiskey is at the bottom of the\r\ntrouble. The church people believe that irreligion is the source of the\r\nevil. The school teacher believes that education will save the day.\r\n\r\nBut can not the student of human affairs see that the demoralization\r\nincident to four years of civil strife shook our entire social system\r\nlike an earthquake? Did not the Spanish war light up,—luridly,\r\nvividly, horribly,—the almost universal corruption which had seized\r\nupon the body politic?\r\n\r\n“Eat, drink and be merry—tomorrow we die.” When a nation rings with\r\nthat cry, it is close to the whirlpool. “Let us have a good time!” The\r\nman drinks and makes much of his food; the woman drinks and thinks a\r\ndeal about her eating; the boy drinks and knows the good dishes; the\r\ngirl drinks and daintily scans the menu. “Hello!” shouts the dashing\r\nboy; “Hello!” answers the dashing girl, and off they hurry to some\r\nplace where talk, songs, pictures and conduct are “up-to-date,”—_and\r\nin many and many a case the Hello couple are reeling hellward by\r\nmidnight_.\r\n\r\nDon’t we _know_ that our statute-book is the Iliad of our woes?\r\n\r\nThe few are wickedly rich while the many are helplessly poor, because\r\nthe laws have been made _for the purpose of bringing about that very\r\nstate of affairs_. There is a fierce struggle for existence which waxes\r\nmore desperate every year. _Men fight each other for a job, with a\r\nferocity like that of starving dogs fighting over a bone._ Girls are\r\nforced into positions where delicacy of feeling is trampled out and\r\nwhere it requires heroic courage to resist the tempters who are ever on\r\nher trail to pull her down.\r\n\r\nWho does not know that the ten million dollars which one of our\r\nreligious denominations recently sent abroad for Foreign Missions would\r\nbe better employed if it were devoted to the breaking up of our hideous\r\nmarketing of white women to lewd houses? Who does not feel that the\r\nhundreds of millions which our Government has spent in the Philippines\r\nhad better have been left in the pockets of the taxpayers here at home?\r\nWho does not know that we ought to tremble for our future when we see\r\nhow our law-makers have been the willing tools of those who ruin the\r\nmillions of men and women, girls and boys, in order that a few hundreds\r\nof ravenous rascals like Rockefeller and Carnegie and Havemeyer and\r\nRyan and Vanderbilt and Gould and Harriman shall each be richer than\r\nany king ever was?\r\n\r\nMost of us _do_ know it. Some of us have long been trying to arouse the\r\npatient, victimized millions to a sense of their own wrongs. But it is\r\nan uphill work. Some despair, some scoff, some are callous, some won’t\r\nlisten, some are timid, some are interested in keeping things as they\r\nare, some think it is God’s will that a favored few should reach the\r\nParadise of unlimited riches while the unfavored multitudes sink into a\r\nhell of eternal wretchedness.\r\n\r\nThe lotus-eater’s plaint of “_Let us alone_” is to me as fearful as\r\nthat reckless, creedless, madly selfish cry “_Let us eat, drink and be\r\nmerry: tomorrow we die._”\r\n\r\nJay Gould contemptuously dismissed the suggestion that, some day, the\r\nAmerican people might rise in arms against its swinish plutocracy. Said\r\nJason, the cynical,\r\n\r\n“_I could hire one-half of the people to shoot the other half._”\r\n\r\nThe man who said that was not more contemptuous of us than are the\r\nplutocrats who rule and rob us now. But perhaps what he said is the\r\ntruth. They manage to keep us divided, about half and half, in the\r\nbloodless battle of ballots; perhaps, if it came to shooting they could\r\ndivide us the same way.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “He Certainly Was Good To Me.”\r\n\r\nNew York _American_]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Survey of the World\r\n\r\nBy Tom Dolan\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress Reassembles—The President’s Message\r\n\r\nThe attention of the sixty-first Congress was naturally given first to\r\nthe President’s annual document, which this year lost none of its usual\r\nlength. In its entirety it is a plea for centralization of governmental\r\nauthority in “the administration,” alleging that the nation cannot be\r\n“in peril from any man who derives authority from the people and who\r\nis from time to time compelled to give an account of its exercise to\r\nthe people.” Mr. Roosevelt should know, and does know, however, that\r\nunder our present manner of electing executives “the people” are as a\r\nmass too indifferent, or too ignorant, to demand such an accounting\r\nand until election by popular vote is incorporated as a principle of\r\nproceeding, he is virtually suggesting a monarchy, upheld by a special\r\ncaste consisting of the holders of Federal office and the recipients of\r\nAdministrative favor.\r\n\r\nFor the control of the trusts, he offers nothing new—nothing that he\r\nhas not already woven into the fabric of “my policies.” He denounces\r\nthe Sherman law, and believes in regulation and control by strong\r\ncentral authority.\r\n\r\nOn the question of the currency, he was pathetically weak and eagerly\r\nwilling to leave it to his monetary commission to “propose a thoroughly\r\ngood system which will do away with the existing defects,” and very\r\nguardedly admits that there was a “monetary disturbance in the fall of\r\n1907 which immensely increased the difficulty of ordinary relief.”\r\n\r\nOn the labor question—a matter upon which Hamiltonians may much more\r\nsafely grow expansive than those of finance—Mr. Roosevelt declared\r\nagainst child labor, for diminution of work on the part of women, and\r\na general shortening of the hours of labor and for an inheritance tax\r\nthat would help to equalize the burden of taxation which now falls\r\nso heavily upon those least able to bear it. He commended highly the\r\nintelligence of the labor vote, which refused to be “swung” as a\r\nunit for any candidate and took occasion to pay his respects to Mr.\r\nTaft as an ideal Judge. On protection to workingmen, Mr. Roosevelt\r\ndisplayed a sympathetic attitude which does him much credit. “When a\r\nworkman is injured, he needs not an expensive and dreadful lawsuit,\r\nbut the certainty of relief through immediate administrative action.\r\nNo academic theory about ‘freedom of contract’ should be permitted to\r\ninterfere with this movement.” He urged Congress to pass without delay\r\nan Employers’ Liability Law, which should serve as a model, covering\r\nthe District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nAmong the old issues to which Mr. Roosevelt adverted were\r\nrecommendations pertaining to the preservation of forests and the\r\nencouragement of industrial education. The Philippine policy is to\r\ncontinue and independence is promised so indefinitely that it is\r\napparent that no voluntary, relinquishment is ever intended. Both the\r\nParcels Post and Postal Savings Banks were favored, the former being\r\nstrongly urged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Washington, D. C. Herald_]\r\n\r\nResults—not the sinking of money for no adequate return—was stressed\r\nas to inland waterways. Considerations in reference to public health\r\ncame in for a word, and the Pure Food Law was lauded in superlative\r\nterms. The President advocated increased appropriations for educational\r\ndepartments and for increasing the “now totally inadequate pay of our\r\njudges.”\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt advises abandonment of the idea of combining New Mexico\r\nand Arizona into one State, and suggests that they each be given\r\nindependent Statehood.\r\n\r\nHe averred that the nation’s foreign policy is “based on the theory\r\nthat right must be done between nations as between individuals.” This\r\nis a specimen of “speaking softly.” The “Big Stick” follows almost\r\nimmediately in the almost frantic state of mind he seems to be in\r\nconcerning the needs for a great army and navy. Even the small boys\r\nought to be trained in rifle practice! If he had added the hope that\r\nsmall girls would be taught to mould bullets and scrape lint, he would\r\nhave been patriotically sublime!\r\n\r\nThat portion of his message which demands that members of legislative\r\nbranch of the government be prosecuted as are those in the executive,\r\nand his sneer at Congress as being afraid of the Secret Service has\r\ncreated intense excitement in both houses and the language used in the\r\nmessage may be totally expunged from the records. Both Democrats and\r\nRepublicans concur in the disposition to ignore matters of party and\r\nact in this matter, casting a stigma upon them all, as a whole.\r\n\r\nMr. Roosevelt’s bold assertion that the Panama Canal is a model for all\r\nwork of that kind will meet many challengers. Philippe Bunau-Varilla,\r\nformerly Panama minister to the United States, has just issued a\r\nstatement declaring that the Canal will cost $280,000,000 and that the\r\nplan now being carried out, owing to the dangers from the Gatun Dam,\r\n(which has already shown itself unreliable) “will result almost surely\r\nin the greatest disaster in the history of public undertakings.”\r\n\r\nThe President’s message, altogether, is like the President himself:\r\ncommendable in some respects, partisan to a degree and strong in\r\nlanguage rather than logic.\r\n\r\n\r\nReforming the House of Lords\r\n\r\nSomeone has said that every twentieth Englishman is a genius and the\r\nbalance dolts, or something of that tenor. The Special committee of the\r\nHouse of Lords, in its report recommending a radical change in that\r\nbody, seems actuated by a desire to retain as many of the twentieth\r\ntype as possible and eliminate the rest.\r\n\r\nAt present, this august body contains 618 members, consisting of the\r\nroyal princes, the Archbishops of York and Canterbury, two dozen\r\nminor bishops, the English peers and those Scotch and Irish peers who\r\nhave been elected by their fellows to represent the nobility of these\r\nrespective countries.\r\n\r\nThe committee each of the colonies send elective peers; that the\r\n24 bishops elect one-third of their number to the Lords at each\r\nParliament. The Archbishops are to remain permanent features and about\r\n130 hereditary peers are to be retained, including such as have held\r\nthe position of Cabinet minister, or of Governor-General of Canada, or\r\nViceroy of India or have enjoyed high positions in the army or navy;\r\nand all who have served for twenty years in the House of Commons. Five\r\njudges are to be added as “law lords” and of the remaining number 200\r\nare to be elected as representative peers.\r\n\r\nBy this selective, as well as elective, method, the fittest in brains,\r\nskill and ability would survive. It is equally probable, however, that,\r\nso far as broad, progressive policies are concerned, a House of Lords\r\nso made up would be even a greater handicap to the popular will than\r\nas it stands today. The average Lord now accepts his seat therein with\r\nthat nonchalance which characterizes his attitude toward those other\r\nfavors of fortune which are his by birth. He feels no added pride and\r\nseldom any real obligation to interest himself in measures that come\r\nbefore the House. While he is an obstructionist, it is after a rather\r\npassive fashion. To change this so as to make a seat in the galaxy of\r\nLords a prize to be contested for, while limiting the eligibles to\r\nthe race in the arbitrary manner proposed, would inevitably mean a\r\npowerful governing body, supersaturated with class-consciousness and\r\nhyper-sensitive to the faintest breath against its own aristocratic\r\ndominance. The reactionaries would entrench themselves by electing the\r\nmost brilliant men of their own views. The lonely members from Canada,\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa would have slight influence in\r\nshaping the destiny of the Empire as a whole and none as to England’s\r\ndomestic affairs. To public opinion, then, as now, the House of Lords\r\nwould be almost impervious. How, indeed, can any set of men taught to\r\nregard themselves, from infancy, as superior beings, be affected by the\r\nideas of the plebeians? They have always assumed their class to be the\r\nnatural governor and guardian of the hoi polloi. If the H. P. doesn’t\r\nthrive, it’s not the fault of the nobility.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that the House of Lords itself should be shamed over\r\nthe survival of a caste system which permits even an idiot, born to the\r\npurple, to share the honors and responsibilities of membership in the\r\nhighest assembly of their government, but even those apologists who\r\nmaintain that the Britisher of rank feels obligations to humanity as\r\ndoes no other public man must take fright at the proposed concentration\r\nof power the new plan would insure. Certes, after many years of\r\nthwarted hopes for bettering of general conditions, the patient English\r\npeople could only rise, in holy wrath, and abolish the House of Lords\r\naltogether. And, as a real and permanent reform measure, why don’t they\r\ndo it now?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe German Incident Closed\r\n\r\n    “The toot of the Teuton is tootin’ no more,\r\n     All sober sits Berlin, beside the wild Spree;”\r\n\r\nThe words of this classic were never more apropos. The ebullition of\r\nGerman indignation over their Kaiser’s indiscreet interview, published\r\nin the London Daily Telegraph recently, the salient features of which\r\nwere summarized in the December Jeffersonian, has subsided and the hard\r\nwords, as proverbial, have “broken no bones.” That something drastic\r\nshould be done to prevent such outbreaks in future, as well as to\r\nreprimand the “Great War Lord” for the unfortunate garrulity, was the\r\ngenerally held, resentful opinion; but _doing_ it, was another matter,\r\nunless the mincing of words between the Emperor and his Imperial\r\nChancellor could so be construed. After their meeting for the purpose\r\nof discussing the matter, Von Bulow announced to the Reichstag that\r\nhe was convinced the Kaiser would hereafter “observe that reserve,\r\neven in private conversations, which is equally indispensable in the\r\ninterest of a uniform policy, and for the authority of the Crown.”\r\nThis assurance was further bolstered by an official publication that\r\nEmperor William “approved this statement” and “gave Prince Bulow the\r\nassurance of his continued confidence.” This pacification the Reichstag\r\nwas apparently glad to accept, in lieu of a constitutional guarantee\r\nof a check upon the Kaiser. During the national hysteria, when all\r\nwere alike guilty of lese-majeste, it was safe to join the popular\r\nclamor. In his official capacity, no member of the Reichstag seemed\r\nbold enough to attempt to storm the fortress of “Divine Right.” It\r\nwould have required a now impossible unification of opposing forces\r\nin that body, under leadership fearless of the consequences to self,\r\nto have magnified the disturbance into a real revolution in the\r\nGerman government. So, on all sides, there was a refluencing tide of\r\ndispleasure—but the water-mark will remain for many a day to show that\r\npatience has its limits even in a people of almost unexampled docility.\r\nAnd, after having enjoyed a very carnival of free speech, they will\r\nnever again submit to the gagging which has heretofore obtained.\r\n\r\nWhether the Kaiser feels the humiliation accredited to him or not, is\r\nrather doubtful. At any rate, he viewed the storm with superb outward\r\nindifference, causing it to be understood, while he was enjoying\r\nhimself on a hunting trip with the heir to the Austrian throne, that\r\nhe was “heedless of the exaggerations of public criticism which he\r\nregarded as incorrect.” He is still The State—chance confidences with\r\ninterviewers notwithstanding. But his subjects may not be quite so\r\npassive as before.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Freight Rates Increase]\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents in China\r\n\r\nOne of the strangest, strongest characters in history passed from the\r\nstage when the Dowager Empress of China, best known to us as Tsi An,\r\nyielded to Death—her only conqueror—some time in November last.\r\nBorn a slave, the story of how her wit, beauty, determination and\r\nutter unscrupulousness placed an empire boasting at least 400,000,000\r\nsubjects at her feet, is well known. For fifty years she reigned\r\nan absolute despot, while other nations rose and fell, maps were\r\nchanged, the tide of Occidental civilization began to beat down the\r\nancient barriers of her realm. Knowing that the summons had come to\r\nher, did she yet stretch out her still powerful hand and remove the\r\nweakling Emperor, whose demise preceded her own by so short a time?\r\nA physical wreck—a virtual prisoner and perhaps the victim of some\r\nbrain stupefying drug, there were still dangers to be feared to the\r\ndynasty she so long upheld, and all her record shows she would not\r\nhave hesitated at any step necessary to preserve the reign of the\r\nManchus and repel the efforts which reformers might make, through\r\nTsai-ti’ien, to hasten forward a foreign type of government. Much\r\nevil is said of the Dowager Empress—and much evil perhaps she did,\r\naccording to some standards; yet she selected her ministers with\r\nsome wisdom and can scarcely be censured for refusing to let herself\r\nand the Chinese masses—both intensely conservative—be harried into\r\n“reforms” for which they were unprepared. The national and racial pride\r\nof such highly informed Chinese as had received not only the education\r\nappropriate to their class at home, but who had enjoyed foreign\r\nadvantages, is in nowise typical—and it must be remembered that Tsi\r\nAn was dealing with “teeming millions” indeed. She was not stubbornly\r\nunprogressive, as various Imperial edicts issued within the past decade\r\ndemonstrated. Indeed, it was not long since that one assurance was\r\ngiven that a Constitution would be granted within nine years.\r\n\r\nPrince Chun—named recently as regent, will link the ideas and methods\r\nof the ancient Pure Dynasty with those which must prevail long ere\r\nlittle Pu Yi, his baby Emperor, who toddled into the Manchu succession\r\nthe other day, can take the reins of government for himself. The people\r\nhave accepted the tiny monarch designed to continue the present dynasty\r\nwith no ill will. Chinese discontent has been constant for lo! these\r\ncenturies, for the Manchus are a foreign Mongol race, but the almost\r\nsimultaneous deaths of the nominal ruler and his iron-willed aunt, and\r\nthe installation of a three-year-old as puppet king, made comparatively\r\nslight impression. Indeed, it is not likely that all China knows even\r\nyet that there has been any change, so slowly does news travel in some\r\nparts thereof. Under such torpid conditions, there may be uprisings\r\nagainst Viceroys in certain provinces, but anything like a general\r\nrevolution will not in many years threaten the peace of the empire.\r\nThe emancipation of China will come through enlightened rulers; or be\r\ndeferred by intrigue within the Court. Three uprisings have taken place\r\nagainst the Manchu rule, but they were all before foreign interests\r\nand influence had intervened to give the yellow race a common cause\r\nagainst white aggression and patriotic Chinamen and Manchus will prefer\r\na government by all the people rather than a mere change in the throne.\r\nUnless signs speedily fail, no real “crisis” is imminent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “THE DONKEY IS A PATIENT ANIMAL.”—_W. J. Bryan._\r\n\r\nNew York _World_]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Japanese Alliance and Elihu Root\r\n\r\n“The people of the United States hold for Japan a peculiar feeling of\r\nregard and friendship” wrote Theodore Roosevelt after the visit to\r\nhimself and Elihu Root of Baron Kogoro Takahira, Japanese Ambassador,\r\nlast September. After much that has seemed unnecessarily subterranean\r\nin the negotiations between Takahira and the Secretary of State,\r\nadmissions have been wormed from official sources that these gentlemen\r\nhave consummated a pact that is variously regarded as a miracle of deft\r\ndiplomacy; a dangerous entangling alliance or as a farcical declaration\r\nof non-binding intentions.\r\n\r\nSubjected to examination, the “agreement” covers the following main\r\npoints, stated in brief:\r\n\r\nA mutual wish to “encourage the free and peaceful development of their\r\ncommerce in the Pacific.”\r\n\r\nSince the imperialistic idea is that peace is best preserved by being\r\nprepared for war, this “peaceful development” inevitably means to the\r\nUnited States a vastly increased naval burden. No less if Japan be\r\nhonest than if she be insincere.\r\n\r\nThe second article declares for the maintenance of the existing status\r\nquo and the “defense of the principle of equal opportunity for commerce\r\nand industry _in China_.”\r\n\r\nHas the Chinese boycott of Japanese goods anything to do with this?\r\nTakahira or Marquis Katsura, Japanese premier, please answer.\r\n\r\nThe third article obligates each nation to respect the territorial\r\npossessions in the Pacific of the other.\r\n\r\nWhat territorial possessions has Uncle Sam save the Philippines, whose\r\nloss would be a good riddance?\r\n\r\nThe fourth article is nothing more than an elaboration of the second.\r\n\r\nThe fifth article reveals the purpose, the strength and the danger,\r\nof the understanding in that it pledges each government, should the\r\npresent regulations in the Pacific be disturbed in anywise, “or the\r\nprinciple of equal opportunity, as above defined” be threatened, “to\r\ncommunicate with each other for the purpose of arriving at a mutual\r\nunderstanding with regard to the measures they may consider it useful\r\nto take.”\r\n\r\nRealizing that no treaty outright could be made without Senatorial\r\nindorsement and that this would mean a departure from all American\r\ntradition and policy, Elihu Root has framed a skillful document which\r\ncreates a binding promise to consult Japan in any issue that may arise,\r\nwhile it escapes the odium that would attach to an actual alliance now.\r\nThe real alliance would be precipitated whenever emergency, real or\r\nseeming, made it easily and logically possible to invite the conference\r\n“with regard to the measures they may consider it useful to take.” It\r\nties this American Republic to an Asiatic despotism in a manner both\r\nunseemly and unnecessary. Nothing is gained that we did not have and\r\nthe sacrifice of our best traditions is saddening.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is not so much the complications that are to be feared, even though\r\nRussia also fronts the Pacific; even though England and China have\r\ndoubtless concluded an alliance of their own and even though other\r\nworld powers have interests in the Orient which they jealously guard.\r\nAustralia has long viewed Japan with doubt and aversion and the news\r\nof the step taken by the United States will probably shatter a real\r\nfriendship, based upon white blood and mutual ideals, that could have\r\nbeen cemented between that independent colony and our government. Even\r\nthough the agreement had no untoward consequence, it is a melancholy\r\nfact that the American people have surrendered their constitutional\r\nright to govern themselves or control their policies as to other\r\nnations. Mr. Root has formed an alliance binding in fact,—and evading,\r\nby subterfuge, any terms upon which the Senate could base an action.\r\n\r\nIn this, Mr. Root has again shown his famous sleight-of-hand\r\nperformance, “Now you see it and now you don’t!” The intention to\r\nexploit China, by peaceful means, if possible, but to exploit, is\r\nclear; as is the understanding that Korea and the Philippines are to\r\nbe left to their respective masters. Yet, scan the treaty again and it\r\nappears beautifully benevolent. It is indeed a piece of handiwork of\r\nwhich a corporation henchman may be proud as it more than sustains his\r\nreputation for ability to advise his clients how to make illegal moves\r\nwithout breaking the law. In the more elegant language of William C.\r\nWhitney, of New York, who was familiar with the promotion of divers\r\ndeals: “I have had many lawyers tell me what we could not do, and what\r\nthe law forbade. Elihu Root is the first Lawyer I ever had who could\r\nalways tell me how to do legally what we wanted to do.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Treaty Making Power Lies With Congress\r\n\r\nBaltimore _Sun_]\r\n\r\nSuch is the record of the man who is to succeed Thomas C. Platt,\r\nas Senator from New York, Timothy L. Woodruff having been forced\r\ngracefully to renounce his claims. It will be a relief to get rid\r\nof the disgusting septuagenarian, Platt; but is a profound pity his\r\nsuccessor should not be a man in whom the people have confidence. Root\r\nhas always been a wily corporation lawyer; he has just completed an\r\nalliance in contravention of the spirit of the Constitution and is\r\nbeing elevated to the Senate through Federal patronage.\r\n\r\nHe may serve his country well—but the leopard will have to change a\r\ngood many of his spots.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Standard Oil Inquiry\r\n\r\n“It was a bad year for the trusts,” wrote Edward Sherwood Meade,\r\nProfessor of finance in the University of Pennsylvania, at the close of\r\n1907. In support of his comment, Prof. Meade cited the $29,000,000 fine\r\nlevied against the Standard Oil, of Indiana, by Judge K. M. Landis,\r\nand the proceedings instituted to dissolve the Oil and Tobacco trusts.\r\nAs is well known, Judge Grosscup, of the United States Circuit Court\r\nof Appeals, reversed Judge Landis on technicalities and the Company\r\nwas saved from the imposition of the fine through what was universally\r\nexecrated as a gross miscarriage of justice. Attorney-General Bonaparte\r\nat the time expressed himself freely in demanding of Congress the\r\nenactment of “a more comprehensive law permitting appeals by the\r\nGovernment in criminal cases,” instead of the present statutes which\r\n“give to the wealthy defendants in such cases an unfair advantage.”\r\nSo 1907 was not such a bad year for the Standard Oil,—but a most\r\nprofitable one, as the favor extended it in the Indiana suit enabled\r\nthe stock of the Company to soar to nearly 700 forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in the latter part of 1908 by the Government to\r\ndissolve the Standard Oil are the most important ever instituted\r\nagainst this odious monopoly. It is almost incredible that, after 20\r\nyears of immunity, John D. Rockefeller should be forced to “show cause”\r\nwhy he should no longer be allowed to pursue his taciturn, undisputed\r\nspoliations. Frank B. Kellog, champion “trust-buster” has charge of the\r\ninvestigations which thus far have presented something the appearance\r\nof opera bouffe. The figures juggled with are so enormous, and the\r\n“forgetfulness” of Rockefeller, Archbold and other testifiers such\r\nconspicuous examples of humorous insolence, that the public mind is\r\nunprepared to hope for a satisfactory outcome to the investigation.\r\nThe present administration has but a couple of months more in which to\r\nmake its denunciations against the Standard Oil effective, after years\r\nof apparently righteous wrath and no one is greatly to be blamed for\r\nadopting a cynical attitude as to the expected result.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt _has_ been a bad year, this closing 1908, for the Tobacco folk. The\r\nvictory of the tobacco growers of the Burley district of Kentucky early\r\nin December over the American Tobacco Company proves what a determined\r\nstand may accomplish on the part of the producer, without entering the\r\nCourts at all. It is safe to say that this Christmas will have been one\r\nof the happiest ever spent by the farmers of Kentucky, among whom some\r\n$20,000,000 will be circulating for tobacco grown and held over, some\r\nof it, for nearly two years. It will make for a peace and good-will in\r\nvery truth, for the “night-riding” is considered at an end.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCapitulation to the tobacco growers of a limited section, however,\r\nis the least of the American Tobacco Company’s troubles just now,\r\nit having been declared, in suit brought by the government for its\r\ndissolution, to be a “combination in restraint of trade” which is\r\namenable to the provisions of the Sherman Act of July 2, 1890. Appeal\r\nfrom this decision is being taken to the Supreme Court and upon the\r\nresult of this “last resort” will hinge all that is vital in reference\r\nto the ability of the government to control the various kinds of\r\nindustrial combinations engaged in inter-state traffic.\r\n\r\nJudge Lacombe, in voicing the majority opinion of his Court,\r\nobserves that: “By insensible degrees, under the operation of many\r\ncauses, business, manufacturing and trading alike, has more and more\r\ndeveloped a tendency towards larger aggregations of capital and more\r\nextensive combinations of individual enterprise. It is contended\r\nthat, under existing conditions, in that way only can production be\r\nincreased and cheapened, stability in reasonable prices secured and\r\nindustrial progress assured. But every aggregation of individuals\r\nor of corporations, formerly independent, immediately upon its\r\nformation terminates an existing competition; whether or not some\r\nother competition may subsequently arise. The Act, as above construed,\r\nprohibits every contract or combination in restraint of competition.\r\nWhat benefits have come from this combination, or from others\r\ncomplained of, it is not material to inquire, nor need subsequent\r\nbusiness methods be considered, nor the effects on production or\r\nprices.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington _Herald_]\r\n\r\nJudge Noyes, who agreed with Judge Lacombe, says, in addition: “It\r\nis of much importance to many people at the present time whether the\r\ndefendants have entered into an unlawful combination. It is OF THE MOST\r\nMOMENTOUS IMPORTANCE TO ALL THE PEOPLE FOR ALL THE TIME WHETHER THE\r\nNATIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS POWER TO REACH INDUSTRIAL COMBINATIONS DEALING\r\nACROSS STATE LINES.”\r\n\r\nIn his dissenting opinion, Judge Ward took the position that the\r\npurposes of the defendants “should not be made to depend upon\r\noccasional illegal or oppressive acts, but must be collected on their\r\nconduct as a whole.” That they strove “to increase their business and\r\nthat their great success is a natural growth resulting from industry,\r\nintelligence and economy, doubtless largely helped by the volume of\r\nbusiness and the great capital at command.”\r\n\r\nWhat view will the Supreme Court take? That “restraint of trade” _is_\r\n“restraint of trade” or that that it is _not_ “restraint of trade”\r\nif only a few laws are broken, only a few competitors hurt and if\r\ndefendants are not suffering for want of money?\r\n\r\n\r\nHaytian Revolution\r\n\r\nAmid a fanfare of banjos, a rattling of “de bones” and the patting\r\nof the Juba, General Simon entered the Presidential Palace at\r\nPort-au-Prince, capitol and chief city of Hayti, early in December,\r\nthus triumphantly concluding a decisive rebellion during which Nord\r\nAlexis, recent dictator, was forced to flee for refuge to a French\r\nvessel. Simon’s election to the Presidency by the National Assembly\r\nwill follow, as a matter of mere detail, providing neither General\r\nFirman, General Fouchard nor other “General” of opposing armies which\r\ncontain no privates at all, pulls off another revolution before\r\nbreakfast. This is a fearsome possibility, though, inasmuch as the\r\ncountries to which these heroes may be induced to repair as ministers\r\nare limited; and the aspirants for the dictatorship are unlimited;\r\nbesides, there may be a crop of the deposed ministers wending their way\r\nhomeward to hatch up more plots—and how may all be pacified? Moreover,\r\nit had been six long, weary years since Hayti had any revolution to\r\nspeak of and the appetite of the Black Republic for such diversions is\r\nnot easily appeased. Serpent worship may pall and the charm of Voodoo\r\nrites wax monotonous. A chance to burn and pillage now and then helps\r\namazingly to relieve the dulness of the island.\r\n\r\nHayti continues an object lesson in the progress that civilization\r\nmakes when left to the care of the brother in black. It is a chunk\r\nof “Darkest Africa” left festering on the seas. The conditions there\r\nbeing so terrible, even in non-revolutionary periods, there are\r\nalmost no white residents whose presence, in larger numbers, would\r\nforce other governments to a summary clean-up of the nauseous spot.\r\nU. S. cruiser Tacoma has been dispatched to St. Marc and Gonaives to\r\nextend protection to those who may be in distress and to quell further\r\nthreatened rioting.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Virginia Decision\r\n\r\nHow far practice had departed from the equitable principle that all\r\nremedy in the State Courts must be exhausted before complainants might\r\nappeal their case to the United States Courts, is emphasized by the\r\nimpression amounting almost to a sensation, produced by the decision,\r\non November 30th last by the Supreme Court covering the Virginia\r\nrailway rate case, wherein an injunction had first been obtained by the\r\ncorporation from a lower Federal Court, preventing the enforcement of\r\nthe two-cent rate prescribed by the Railway Commission of the State.\r\nThis restraining order was passed May 14, 1907, and the effect thereof\r\nwas to prevent the exercise of the Railway Commission’s legitimate\r\ncontrol over the passenger traffic of their State until now. The\r\nrebuke to Federal Judge Pritchard, who granted the injunction, in the\r\nreversal of his findings in favor of the railroad comes from a source\r\nwhich the American people have desired to esteem as their highest\r\nsource of justice, and will have admirable effect. Not only will it do\r\nmuch to allay the irritation and the distrust which has been growing\r\nfor many years against this tribunal, but it will have most salutary\r\neffect upon insolent Federal Judges and ruthless corporations. The\r\ninjunction has been their sword and buckler. Ignoring the State Courts,\r\nthey have rushed to obtain injunctions against the enforcement of any\r\nmeasure they happened to dislike. Armed with the premature mandate of\r\na Federal officer, they have defied public opinion and the sovereign\r\nauthority which created and nurtured them. A firm check on the abuse of\r\nthe injunction, had become a crying necessity, if the public were to\r\nrespect wise injunctions and uphold the law.\r\n\r\nThe decision has been hailed with what could honestly be called\r\n“pleased surprise”—so many disappointments had led to the belief that\r\ncorporate interests were obliged to triumph. Wide-spread approval\r\nhas been accorded the ruling. In a few instances criticism has been\r\nproffered, to the effect that the points over which the case originally\r\noccurred are unsolved and that the question of railroad regulation is\r\nas misty as before. These are matters, however, which do not touch the\r\nprinciple of State’s redress first, which was universal before the\r\nmisconstruction of the 14th Amendment made possible such usurpation of\r\nauthority as the one for which Judge Pritchard has been called down.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOther interesting court decisions have taken place within a short\r\nperiod. The New Jersey Court of Appeals, for instance, has considered\r\na knotty problem relative to its collateral inheritance law. Philo\r\nMiles, a British subject, died in London, leaving a considerable amount\r\nof stock in a New Jersey corporation and the lower courts held that\r\nthe tax could be levied upon same. The Appellate Court negatived this\r\nconclusion on the ground that personal property which includes stocks\r\nand bonds must follow the situs of the owner and be taxed “there and\r\nthere only.” They held that if every State could levy an inheritance\r\ntax upon the full estate of the deceased, his personal property being\r\nreturned in the inventory of the executor or administrator, the estate\r\nof the deceased could be taxed as often as there were States in which\r\nhe chanced to have personal property at the time of his death. This\r\nwould, of course, be inconceivable.\r\n\r\nIt would be helpful to know just how England, which has a National\r\nand effective inheritance tax, will manage with the property held in\r\nNew Jersey by the late Mr. Miles. Much of the wealth of her citizens\r\nis represented by stocks in American corporations, mortgages upon\r\nAmerican property and like personal effects. Possibly the heirs are\r\nmore scrupulous in returning such property for taxation than are our\r\nown rich men, who think no wrong of sending out of the State all\r\npersonalty for long enough to swear tax statements that are true in the\r\nletter, but utterly false in fact. To evade municipal taxation, they\r\ndo not hesitate to take their securities outside the corporate limits\r\nfor a day or so. The owner of a home or farm may not escape bearing\r\nthe burdens of government, but those who derive annual fortunes from\r\ndividends upon “personal property” go scatheless.\r\n\r\nA national inheritance tax, with stringent provisions to enforce it,\r\nwould go a long way toward evening things up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A SOCIAL CALL _New York World_]\r\n\r\n\r\n“Holland Making Faces.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOO CLOSE FOR COMFORT\r\n\r\nThe hand of the law will get old John D. himself yet.\r\n\r\n—Minneapolis Journal.]\r\n\r\nDainty and attractive are the naval maneuvers indulged in by the little\r\nQueen of Holland against the Venezuelan government these days. If not\r\nto the entire satisfaction of The Hague, at least they will win her\r\nhigh plaudits from the Red Cross Society. For where was ever such\r\nconsideration shown as has been displayed by this firm, feminine foe\r\nto the blustering South American President? That he has been perfectly\r\nhorrid to her, all will admit. It is true that he has been entirely\r\nwithin his rights in that trans-shipment decree, for the regulation\r\nof the internal commerce of his own country is a prerogative which\r\nthe most modest executive might safely claim; but it is likewise\r\nindisputable that it has seriously crippled the thrifty Dutch merchants\r\nof Curacoa; and, anyhow, Castro need not have been so overbearing\r\nabout it, which was no way to handle a situation of that delicacy. He\r\nshould have admitted that he was wrong, begged forgiveness and then,\r\nof course, _she_ could have been no less magnanimous than to have told\r\nthe sturdy burghers of Williamsted that they must cease to cry over the\r\nmilk that somebody else had a right to spill; she would have outdone\r\nhis courtesy by her sweetness and all would have been well. But some\r\nmen even when Presidents, fail to understand that women are women, even\r\nwhen queens, and so he was uncouth when the situation simply begged\r\nfor _noblesse oblige_. Nevertheless, when Castro fell ill, Wilhelmina\r\ndeferred her vengeance until he had gone to consult European surgeons.\r\nNo rattling of guns or clanking of sabres if the enemy had a headache;\r\nno furore that might disturb the quiet of his citadel.\r\n\r\nNow her fleet sails nattily over the Caribbean, to the vast interest of\r\nvice President Gomez, left in charge of Venezuela, and of the world at\r\nlarge. To coarse, husky individuals, this seems a strange proceeding,\r\nperhaps, but those cast in more delicate mold will realize that\r\nWilhelmina kept the navy tied to her ample apron strings till now, lest\r\nthe clatter of wooden sabots over the hard, white decks, might make\r\nCastro nervous.\r\n\r\nSeriously, it seems that Holland is doing little more than making a\r\ndemonstration the purpose of which is uncertain. After simmering so\r\nlong, the trouble between the two countries could hardly cool off,\r\nwith dignity to Holland, without revocation or modification of the\r\nshipping regulations, intervention by other powers or a goodly show\r\nof resentment. If Holland is saving her face by the latter means, who\r\ncould be sorry? No one doubts the courage of her people, nor that\r\nthey would be met by no mean resistance in attempting to shell the\r\nVenezuelan forts and brave blood should not be spilled in a cause that\r\nseems so entirely within the scope of arbitration.\r\n\r\n\r\nA Word About Sectarianism\r\n\r\nThat England in the present Century should be undergoing a hard-fought\r\nbattle over the matter of religious control over her public schools\r\nproves the tenacity of sectarian clutch when Church and State join\r\nhands in bonds of government. The new educational bill which has passed\r\na second reading in the House of Commons is a compromise measure\r\nwhich embraces a Nonconformist concession to the church of what is\r\nknown as “the right of entry” which permits parents or guardians to\r\nrequest denominational instruction for their children during certain\r\nhours—teachers being expected to volunteer for this service. On its\r\nside, the church relinquishes control of the schools and the abolition\r\nof all religious tests for the teachers. The British public is still\r\nstolidly Episcopalian and that Church yields slowly any of its\r\nprerogatives. The bill, if enacted into law, will therefore not make in\r\nyears any appreciable change in the practical status of the schools,\r\nbut will enable those objecting to enforced religious teachings to have\r\ntheir sentiment respected. The use of public funds for denominational\r\ninstruction is without doubt one of the most vicious forms of\r\nintellectual slavery to which any people may be forced to submit.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet this very slavery is openly advocated for America today by Cardinal\r\nGibbons, of the Roman Catholic Church, who desires the public schools\r\nto be wholly denominational and supported by the government. Small\r\nwonder, then, that Mr. Roosevelt’s characterization as “bigotry” the\r\nrefusal of anyone to vote for a Roman Catholic for the presidency has\r\nmet with profound disapproval. Nowhere did he strike a “popular note”\r\nand protests have been dignified, but severe. In the selection of\r\nhis creed, the citizen has been given unhampered choice, but in the\r\nrestriction of those eligible to the high office of Chief Executive,\r\nthe people will continue to consider the preservation of their\r\ninstitutions of paramount importance. To democracy everywhere, and\r\nin all the ages, the Roman Church, as an organization, has been the\r\nconsistent foe. Centralization of authority in the hands of puppet\r\nmonarchs under its control is its undeviating aim. No man who can\r\nsubmit himself to the domination of a priesthood, and all that it\r\nmeans, could be a safe president of a free republic.\r\n\r\nIn candidacy for any office, a man must expect the opposition to make\r\ncapital even out of his religious affiliations, and it is true a few\r\nsilly Protestant preachers tried to do this in the case of Mr. Taft,\r\na Unitarian, but that the general mass of people gave his faith any\r\nadverse thought is ridiculous. The Protestant vote divides along\r\npolitical lines just as do those voters of no creed at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Postal Deficit and Express Company Surplus\r\n\r\nAfter a 200 per cent stock dividend declared by one express company\r\nshortly ago and a surplus of some $30,000,000 in another, the\r\nannouncement of a 90 per cent increase in certain express rates will be\r\nhailed with much joy. There seems to be a cheerful disposition on the\r\npart of these corporations to treat the public to the Roosevelt-Straus\r\nremedy for all monopolistic evil—publicity. At least, they are candid\r\nand without blush over their unconscionable extortions so, obviously,\r\nthe admission that they have oppressed the public by unjust rates, and\r\nintend still greater encroachments, ought to be sufficient to quell the\r\nevil at once. Publicity, forsooth! So long as no actual infraction of\r\nany law is involved, why may not a monopoly increase its schedules to\r\n“all the traffic will bear?”\r\n\r\nThe only good publicity in this instance may do is to stimulate a\r\ndilatory and debilitated Congress to pass the Parcel Post enactment\r\nrecommended by Roosevelt and urged by Postmaster-General Meyer. Since\r\nthe express companies can annually “cut a melon” of enormous dividends;\r\nand since the postal deficit for the fiscal year has reached the sum of\r\n$16,910,000 it becomes probable that the long despised and antagonized\r\nparcels post will loom up as perhaps the most practicable means of\r\nhelping the government out of the ditch.\r\n\r\nHow very curious it is that all the “wild ideas” of the Pops come, one\r\nby one, to be recognized as instances of wonderful foresight. If the\r\nparcels post is going to be a good thing for the government, and an\r\ninvaluable thing for the common people in the future, it is pertinent\r\nto ponder on how much ahead the department might be at the present\r\ndate, if the system had been adopted years ago. Instead of a deficit,\r\nthere might have been a neat balance, or a possible surplus, for Mr.\r\nMeyer to offer as a result of the operations of the last fiscal year.\r\nOf course, the franking privilege has been grossly misused for the\r\ncirculation of partisan literature favorable to the administration\r\nwhich got the spoils of office; and the railroads clean up their pile\r\non the job of hauling the mails, but all these things but go to show\r\nthat the postal department, instead of being an argument against the\r\ngovernment taking over public utilities, is the strongest kind of an\r\nargument in favor of so doing. If the government owned the railroads,\r\none avenue of dead loss would be closed; and likewise the elimination\r\nof railroad rings from control of the administration would remove the\r\nincentive to flood the mail with literature in the interests of such\r\ncorporations and other monopolies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BELLS\r\n\r\n\r\n            THE OLD YEAR BELLS.\r\n\r\n    Through the darkness, stealing, stealing,\r\n      Comes their cadence, soft and low,\r\n    While their music, pealing, pealing,\r\n      Falls in sadness on the snow;\r\n    Bid thee think of tasks neglected,\r\n      Tell thee of the work undone,\r\n    Of the hopes that have been shattered,\r\n      E’er the year its course had run.\r\n    Hear the bells! their voices saying:—\r\n      “Of thy hopes keep but the best\r\n    With the falling of our voices,\r\n      Sinks the Old Year to its rest.”\r\n\r\n            THE NEW YEAR BELLS.\r\n\r\n    Through the darkness ringing, ringing,\r\n      Come their voices bright and glad—\r\n    With their music bringing, bringing,\r\n      Thoughts that bid us ne’er be sad—\r\n    Bid us turn from thoughts of sadness,\r\n      For our dead hopes cease to sorrow;\r\n    Tell us of the dawn of gladness,\r\n      Hopes that brighten on the morrow.\r\n    Hear the bells! their voices saying:—\r\n      “Now the Old Year’s sunk to rest\r\n    With the pealing of our voices\r\n      Dawns the New Year,—that is best.”\r\n                         Zarion E.

ANDERSON\r\n\r\n“Mr. Lomax, seek your evening’s pleasure with me—”\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected sentence in English, addressed to him by name in\r\nConstantinople. Page Lomax wheeled sharply from the railing over which\r\nhe had been watching the shadows of silver minarets dissolve like\r\nCleopatra’s pearl in the Golden Horn, now amber as Rhine wine beneath\r\nthe dying sun. By his elbow stood a Turk, whose snowy turban capped\r\nbold features from which only one eye glittered. A sabre scar, which\r\nran across the man’s cheek until it lost itself in his flowing beard,\r\naccounted for the absence of the other. The fellow was of middle\r\nstature, but powerfully made. A loose caftan hanging from his broad\r\nshoulders framed within its folds of vermilion the white linen swathing\r\nhis chest and the orange sash—whence the arabesqued head of a stiletto\r\nscolded at its neighbor, a Mussulman rosary of russet beads—and the\r\ngreen trousers of zouave cut stretching to his saffron half-boots. He\r\nextended a card, on which Page Lomax read:\r\n\r\n                              THE BRISTOL\r\n                      Boulevard des Petit Champs,\r\n                                 PERA.\r\n                      Hosein Aga, Chief Dragoman.\r\n\r\n“My hotel!” Mr. Lomax commented. “I reckon you’re all right.”\r\n\r\nSo Mohammedan and Christian strode off together across the Sultana\r\nBridge, of which the uneven timbers were creaking with each undulation\r\nof its ever-plashing pontoons. Except themselves, no living thing was\r\non it other than gaunt dogs, which flashed snarling tusks at them as\r\nthey groped through the gathering twilight. Near the shore Hosein\r\nwhistled. Forthwith his negro bond-servant, Nakir, met them and bore a\r\ntorch before them to the Theatre Osmaniyeh, where actresses from Paris\r\nwere already in their final pirouettes. An infinite sadness possessed\r\nPage Lomax, as he beheld these daughters of Europe dancing before the\r\nsons of Asia, but his dragoman muttered:\r\n\r\n“I brought you not hither to witness the antics of those painted\r\nharlots. My slave, Zaidee, will follow them.”\r\n\r\nWhile Hosein was speaking, Nakir set on the stage a wicker basket,\r\nwhence a brown and yellow cobra de capello wriggled forth. Hissing with\r\nwrath, it sat up on its tail and spread its hood, embroidered with\r\nthe spectacles of Buddha. On its slender girth each false scale was\r\ngleaming, as the creature coiled and, opening its savage mouth, bared\r\nthose bent fangs of which a mere scratch bestows that rest where no\r\ndreams lift the tent-flap. Then Zaidee appeared. Timing her pace to the\r\nweird tune throbbing from the reed between her lips, she neared the\r\nviper, which launched itself viciously at her. But an invisible force\r\nhalted the snake. Falling in with the rhythm of her flute, it wavered\r\nto and fro—a flame flickering in the wind—until the damsel stilled\r\nher strains, when it lay quiet, so tamed that she wound it as a girdle\r\nround her waist.\r\n\r\n“Her term of hire expires tonight,” quoth Hosein, “And I am about\r\nconvoying her to my villa. Would you spend some time in the home of a\r\nTurk? Nakir, saddle Al Borak for Mr. Lomax.”\r\n\r\nEnveloped in a cloak but with no veiling yashmak, Zaidee was on her\r\npalfry when they joined her. As Hosein turned to his own stirrup, the\r\ngirl shook her raven tresses at the newcomer and pointed at the gate,\r\nwith a gesture, which said: “Leave us!” He might have done so, had he\r\nnot intercepted the look which Nakir was bending on the maiden, as,\r\nwith a devilish grin, which distorted his sooty visage, he tapped the\r\nwhip at his belt. That was enough for Page Lomax. With generous folly,\r\nhe bestrode his horse for the adventure. On their arrival at the house,\r\nZaidee disappeared behind that ebony door, through which no male other\r\nthan Hosein might pass even in his thoughts. Again the bold young man\r\nwas foolhardy, for he gazed after her as one in a dream, from which,\r\nhowever, he was roused by Nakir, who was striding toward him with an\r\nexecutioner’s bow-string in his hand. But here Hosein interposed.\r\n\r\n“Put up your cord,” said he. “Mr. Lomax meant no offense. He is\r\nunfamiliar with our Eastern etiquette, that’s all. The Ethiop,” he\r\ncontinued, this time speaking to his guest, “shall guide you to your\r\nbed.”\r\n\r\nThe young man had fallen into a fitful doze, when he heard the pipe\r\nof Zaidee, followed by the rattle of small pebbles against his\r\ncasement. An instant later, Nakir growled out hoarse words, which the\r\nlistener could not understand. But the sound of heavy blows, under\r\nwhich Zaidee’s voice leapt into shrieks, then fell to sobs, needed no\r\nknowledge of a foreign tongue to be understood. Page Lomax rushed to\r\nthe window. Jerking it open, he leaned out, but he could discern no one\r\nand the unbroken stillness seemed deathly to his overwrought nerves.\r\n\r\nTo his great relief, Hosein’s maid floated in before them at breakfast\r\nthe next morning. She came to dance, while they ate, as the raiment\r\nwhich she wore showed but too plainly to even the inexperienced eye\r\nof the American. From beneath a veil of fleecy gauze, which floated\r\nback freely instead of hiding her face (as is the custom with Moslem\r\nwomen), her loose locks rolled their midnight over her shoulders. Her\r\nbell-shaped sleeves had wrinkled back from bare uplifted arms, on which\r\nsilver chains were throbbing in unison with the rising and falling of\r\nher white bust, caught in the snare of the ample V in her tight scarlet\r\njacket. Below that, a third of her supple figure’s living satin blushed\r\nin full sight above the dark-green band, which clasped in place her\r\ndivided skirt of pearly transparent stuff shimmering down thence to\r\nher naked round ankles. For a brief space the girl drooped her head\r\nand Page Lomax saw red shame feeding on her white cheek, while up from\r\nthe dark depths of her mysterious eyes bitter tears were welling. But\r\nnow hidden music swelled into a loud insistent fugue. With a faint\r\nsigh, almost a sob, Zaidee drifted forward as slowly and as softly as a\r\nsummer cloud thro’ picture after picture of that old, old pantomime of\r\nthe Orient, which illustrates the one text, true in every creed, “Male\r\nand female created He them.” With all his heart uncovered in his gaze,\r\nthe young man hung on her every motion until, with a brusque finale,\r\nshe snapped in twain the thread of wedded harmony and movement with the\r\nwhirling gesture of one hand pointed toward the threshold. Her agonized\r\nglance searched his very brain. Her writhing lips syllabled the word,\r\n“Depart!” Then she vanished.\r\n\r\nTo Hosein, this posturing to music was nothing new. With a strange and\r\nbaffling smile, he had been scrutinizing Page Lomax, instead of Zaidee.\r\nNow he leaned toward him.\r\n\r\n“Were I to judge you by your looks,” quoth he, “I would swear that\r\nmy Persian hussy has cast a spell upon you. Well, you shall hear her\r\nstory. Seven years ago we had a Holy War. I chanced to be at Khorsabad,\r\nwhile our Circassian troops were there, uprooting from the garden\r\nof the faith those weeds, the Yezidees. As I was nearing a cabin,\r\nout strode one of our men. He was a strapping fellow, with big black\r\nwhiskers, and so tall that he had knocked awry his bearskin shako as\r\nhe forgot to stoop in coming forth. One hand held his sword, smoking\r\nwith blood. The other gripped Zaidee. Flinging her in front of me,\r\nhe roared: ‘Will you buy? She’s yours for thirty liras. But I warn\r\nyou—she’s the serpent-tamer’s daughter.’ Before I could answer, she\r\nwas clinging to my knees, screaming: ‘Oh! save me, save me from that\r\ndreadful butcher!’ Well—I brought her home; but she’s but an ingrate.\r\nThese seven seasons have I labored to convert her to God and His\r\nProphet Mohammed, but I can not wean her from the faith of Zoroaster.\r\nSo this week I shall sell her at public auction, if I am bid a thousand\r\nmejedieh for her. She’s worth that, if she’s worth a piastre.”\r\n\r\nThe last word had hardly left Hosein’s lip ere Page Lomax had whipped\r\nforth from his pocket his fountain-pen and traveler’s circular\r\ncheque-book and was writing rapidly. Through eyes narrowed to a\r\ncontemptuous slit, the Turk watched his companion in silence, until the\r\nlatter had laid the writing on his lap, when he said: “What’s this for?”\r\n\r\n“The girl,” replied Page Lomax. “That’s the price you named. The\r\nStamboul Branch of the Credit Lyonnaise will pay it to you in gold,\r\nwhen you present this to it.”\r\n\r\n“Your swift Western way of trafficking is indeed bewildering to a slow\r\nTurk,” rejoined Hosein, in honeyed tones, which barely hid a bitter\r\nsneer. “_We_ would have smoked our narghiles and drank coffee and\r\nchaffered for a week, while as for you—_you_ fire a cheque at one,\r\nhair-trigger fashion. Nakir.” Here he turned to the sullen African,\r\n“Get that cashed. The jade goes with the American hence. But, ere you\r\nleave, Mr. Lomax. I must show you the most beautiful scene on earth,\r\nso they say—Constantinople from a distance. And my own poor fields\r\nhave somewhat of charm, too, about them, I believe. Let me guide you\r\nthrough them. You shall witness things, which—being strange—perchance\r\nmay thrill you as familiar sights can not. Nay, Nakir, there is no\r\nhaste about the cheque. Tomorrow will do. Get you now to the harem and\r\nprepare Zaidee for her departure. Come, Mr. Lomax, we’ll fare forth.”\r\n\r\nAt a pavilion, which was perched on the wrinkled lip of an abyss—a\r\nsheer thousand feet in depth—the Turk paused and, with sweeping\r\ngesture, brought to the notice of Page Lomax’s eye a range of lofty\r\nmountains, which kissed the horizon at their left.\r\n\r\n“There!” he exclaimed. “Are not those sublime? But they are deadly,\r\ntoo; for in them lurk huge spiders, as big as tigers and twice as\r\nfierce. You smile, as if in doubt. I do not blame you. It _is_ hard to\r\nbelieve. But they are there. I am no zoologist, so I can not explain\r\nit, but I have been told that spiders came ages ahead of man on this\r\nearth, as their fossils are found in rock of the primary epoch, while\r\nwe appear first with the quaternary. If this be so, perhaps these ogres\r\nare survivals of gigantic prehistoric spider forebears. But I don’t\r\npretend to know anything about it, except that they are there. No\r\nhunter has ever tamed them; but I have caught and caged one. You shall\r\nsee it, before you leave. Look now to the right.”\r\n\r\nAfar off, yet perfectly plain in every line, thanks to the limpid\r\nclearness of the air, lying in the arms of emerald meadows with her\r\nhead pillowed on undulating hills crowned with cypresses as brunette\r\nas the Queen of Sheba, lay Constantinople, many-colored yet shimmering\r\niridescently under the sapphire tent of heaven, while the Golden Horn\r\npoured the waters of the East at her pearly feet. So noble was the\r\nsight that Page Lomax’s gaze lingered long upon it ere, following\r\nthe sky-line, it rested at last on a frowning stronghold, whence a\r\nroad wound down to a wharf at which a skiff was moored. So grim and\r\nthreatening was this heap of stone that the young man asked Hosein:\r\n\r\n“What is that old keep?”\r\n\r\n“That,” replied his host, “I have named the Tower of Vengeance. During\r\nthe late Muscovite war, my brother, Selim, held it as an outpost. But\r\nthe boy’s soldiers were too few, our supporting column too far away. At\r\ndawn one day, the Russians hurled a regiment against it, stormed it,\r\nbutchered its garrison, fired it. I was too late to save the boy, but\r\nI headed the cavalry, which cut off retreat for his murderers. As I\r\ncharged in, their Colonel quenched this eye for me, but in ten minutes\r\nhe and all his followers were dead. Selim is buried there. Thither I\r\nrepair each afternoon to lament and feed his grave.”\r\n\r\n“To feed his grave?” echoed Page Lomax, inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Yes. In each believer’s tomb is bored a hole, through which he can\r\nhearken to the weeping of those who love him, and can receive food from\r\nthem. The hour for my observance of that rite is nigh. Can you respect\r\nit? If so, you may accompany me thither.”\r\n\r\nAs the two paused before the door of the keep, Page Lomax glanced\r\nthrough the lattice across the vault to the wall on the other\r\nside. Through this, a postern gate opened, close to which he saw a\r\nprism-shaped mound, ending at head and foot in two marble posts on\r\nwhich—each opposing the other—the angels, Nekir and Munkir, will\r\nsit, as they debate whether the soul of Selim shall arise to heaven or\r\ndescend to hell. Roses decked the hillock. In an orifice at its head,\r\na yellow apple and a purple fig awaited the dead man’s appetite. But\r\nwhy was this grave fenced in with stout steel bars, set close together;\r\nand why was it screened overhead with them? Before the Christian had\r\ntime to consider this problem till he might solve it, Hosein threw back\r\nthe outside bar, which held the door to, and, whirling it round on its\r\nwell-oiled hinges, exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“To you, my guest, I yield first place. Enter!”\r\n\r\nBut when Page Lomax was crossing the sill, he felt himself gripped in\r\na grasp of iron. His feet were knocked from under him with a swift and\r\ndexterous trip, and he fell heavily to the floor. Ere he could stagger\r\nup, dazed as he was, clang went the portal. He was a prisoner, with\r\nHosein glaring at him through the grating.\r\n\r\n“Pray to your Nazarene now and see if he can help you,” chuckled his\r\njailer. “Not even Mohammed himself could help you now. I vowed to\r\nsacrifice a hecatomb of unbelievers to my brother. Ninety and nine have\r\nalready tapped at his tomb. You will make the hundredth victim.”\r\n\r\nThe young man was a sinewy six-footer, robust and brave; but the boding\r\nindefiniteness of this threat so overwhelmed him that his fair hair\r\nbristled up and his blue eyes dilated to black, then faded to gray. He\r\ncircled the dungeon, frantically seeking an exit, which yet he knew\r\nhe would not find. Cursing himself for all sorts of a fool, because\r\nhe had not taken his pistol with him, when he left the hotel, he ran\r\nto a corner, where something, which looked like a heaped-up pile of\r\nslender white sticks, was faintly gleaming beneath the dim light coming\r\nfrom above. But, when he saw that they were not sticks but bones, he\r\nstaggered back, almost screaming, and made for the door, which he\r\nreached just in time to be knocked down by a body, which Hosein and\r\nNakir were pitching in. It was Zaidee. Springing up, she wailed forth:\r\n\r\n“Oh! why did you not heed my warnings? Did I not sign to you to depart\r\nin the courtyard, and again under your window and still once more, as I\r\nwas dancing? Now we are lost, both of us. Look up there!”\r\n\r\nFar above, an octagon of lustrous woof and warp was oscillating slowly.\r\nIn it, something vast and dark was cradled.\r\n\r\n“My God! It’s Hosein’s spider!” gasped the young man.\r\n\r\nAnd now across her web the tigress of the air shot her curved and\r\ntoothed claws and buff-colored grappling-hooks and dull-red jaws and\r\nsix of her eight powerful black legs, covered with down and splotched\r\nwith stiff tufts. Up-rearing her round head and thorax and baring thus\r\nthe rich and flexible dark-green fur, as soft as velvet, which clothed\r\nher abdomen, she bent at her wasp-like waist and, balancing on the\r\nverge, fastened her eight eyes—great immovable trance-producing lenses\r\nof terrible crystal—with a gloating stare, full on Hosein’s captives,\r\nhuddled together there below her. And now she swung out. Swaying just\r\nbeneath her hammock, she whetted one of her scythes against the other.\r\nBut, as with horror-stricken gaze, fixed on this monstrous thing, he\r\nand she waited for that to come from which there was no escape, a\r\nsudden inspiration possessed the damsel.\r\n\r\n“Steal along the wall,” she cried to Page Lomax, “And leap from behind\r\nher upon her back at the same instant when I spring thither from in\r\nfront.”\r\n\r\n“But—”\r\n\r\n“No buts about it, Fool! Do you want to be eaten alive? Go!”\r\n\r\nAs he obeyed, the maid plucked from her bodice the pipe of charm and\r\nbegan breathing from it the melody with which she had quelled the\r\nwrath of the cobra de capello. At its first tremulous notes, the grim\r\nexecutioner of the ninety and nine hesitated—stopped reeling out her\r\ncord—no longer was opening and closing her grappling-hooks—sheathed\r\nher dull-red jaws. One awful minute she hovered near, wriggling her\r\neight great curving legs. Then, half asleep under the spell of those\r\ndrowsily sweet sounds, she lowered herself to earth and spread herself\r\nout for slumber. Without ceasing to play, Zaidee inched forward. Close\r\nenough now, she sprang upon the immense spider. That same instant, Page\r\nLomax was by her side.\r\n\r\n“Lie down!” she screamed, suiting her own action to her advice to him.\r\n“Press your toes against the ridge of horn, back of her head! Seize\r\nthat other, yonder, stretching across, just this side her spinneret,\r\nand hold on—do you hear?—hold on with all your might? She’s going to\r\nrise and she’ll toss us off, if she can!”\r\n\r\nEven now the great creature was hauling in her cable. Up she darted\r\nviolently. Whirling round and round, she threshed the air furiously\r\nwith her legs. Finding out that she could not thus throw off her\r\nburden, she reared herself aloft into her web. With frenzied rage,\r\nshe gripped the edges of her house and shook it with all her immense\r\nstrength, until it shot back and forth with dizzying speed, at times\r\nalmost perpendicular to its axis. But, with the desperate power of\r\ndespair, her riders clung to her, until, tiring from her fruitless\r\nefforts to dislodge them, the spider became quiet. Gradually the silken\r\norb slackened from its semi-vertical position to its normal horizontal.\r\nIts whirring lapsed into silence, as it slowly became still. Except\r\nfor a horrible quivering, which was going on under the translucent\r\nshell of horn on which the two were lying, the huge spinner was at last\r\ncrouching motionless. They sat up cautiously and looked around them.\r\nNo roof hemmed them in. But, in order to keep his monster from fleeing\r\nto her native hills, Hosein had inserted one beam running from East to\r\nWest, with three others above it contrariwise from North to South.\r\n\r\n“Play again, Zaidee,” said the young man. “It’s my time now to work.”\r\n\r\nAs the girl’s lulling music once more soothed the spider, he set about\r\ndigging out with his pocketknife that part of the nearest upper rafter,\r\nwhich had rotted at the wall. Soon he could slide this end out. Tugging\r\nthe beam across the main girder, he heaved the extricated timber\r\nathwart the coping of the tower, whence, plunging down, it smote Hosein\r\nto the earth, at the same time striking Nakir, too, and felling him\r\nalso. A screech of anguish burst from the Turk. Unable to rise unaided,\r\nhe seized the honeysuckle, which was clambering aloft on the masonry,\r\nand dragged himself up, only to drop again with a frightful groan, as\r\nhis back was broken. Two of the eunuch’s ribs had been fractured, too,\r\nbut, as his master groaned that awful groan, he hastened to him and,\r\nlifting his head, wiped the bloody froth from Hosein’s lips. The Turk’s\r\neyes, of which nothing except the whites had been showing, now rolled\r\ndown and fixed their failing glance on the faithful slave.\r\n\r\n“Bury me by Selim’s side, Nakir,” he whispered, “And—and don’t let the\r\nGiaour and his jade escape.”\r\n\r\nHis eyes rolled back again—he shivered—there was a deep sigh—then\r\nthe jaw fell.\r\n\r\n“Something’s hurt down there,” cried Page Lomax exultingly. “I only\r\nhope it’s Hosein or his nigger. As wishes cost nothing, I wish it were\r\nboth. Here goes for beam number two!”\r\n\r\nIn a crevice in the wall, just over the end of the second rafter of the\r\nupper three, the wind had lodged a seed one day and from it a sturdy\r\nlittle pine had sprung up. Hunting for food, it had thrust down the\r\nhungry fibres of its roots to feed upon the mortar. It had been nodding\r\ngood cheer to the young man, as the breezes played leap-frog with it,\r\nand he hated to hurt it, but he had to. Grasping it, he wrenched it\r\nfrom its lodging-house. Its roots could not bear to bid adieu to being.\r\nThey clung so closely to the rough ashlar round which they had twined\r\nthat the stone was twisted out with them and crashed to the tiles\r\nbelow, leaving the second beam free at this end, so that Page Lomax\r\ncould send it after the first one.\r\n\r\nThe third rafter of the upper three was fat with turpentine. Scratching\r\na match, the young man held it under the oiliest streak, until a feeble\r\nblaze stole up. Waxing lustier, it parted with sparkling fingers its\r\nblue veil of smoke that it might the better gnaw through the bar on\r\nwhich it was at work. When the beam had nearly burned in two, Page\r\nLomax shoved it upward. It broke. In a twinkling, it had gone outside\r\nto join the others.\r\n\r\n“Now, Zaidee,” he cried, as he cast himself face downward on the great\r\nspider’s back, “Throw yourself here beside me. Rest your toes against\r\nthat same little ledge back of her head. Grip the other as you did\r\nbefore. She’ll bounce over that wall, in the next ten seconds. When she\r\nhits the ground and settles down on her hind-legs, jump, jump for your\r\nlife, and run for the boat with me.”\r\n\r\nMad with the exhilaration of approaching liberty, the huge creature\r\ndived out over her prison wall, alighting noiselessly and without a\r\njar. Giving no heed to Page Lomax and Zaidee, as they fled, she raced\r\nlike the wind along her shortest line of approach toward Nakir. He\r\nwas too far from Hosein’s home ever to reach it, with her in pursuit.\r\nShe was between him and the summer-house. The tower alone remained.\r\nRushing to it, he threw the bar, tore the door open and, plunging\r\nheadlong through it, whirled it to. It had no fastenings on the inner\r\nside. As it swung outward, he must keep it closed in some way or be\r\ndevoured. Flinging himself down, he dug his nails between its stout oak\r\ntransverse and its upright panels and bore on with all his weight. The\r\nspider tapped once or twice on the door. It still remaining closed,\r\nshe squatted down before it. After a few seconds, during which she\r\nseemed to be studying, her terrible eyes dwelt at last on the crack\r\nbetween the door and the doorstep. In a trice, she reached her claws\r\nthrough and sank them into the door on the inner side. In spite of\r\nNakir’s frantic struggling, she fetched it round. With her fierce\r\ngrappling-hooks, she pounced upon him. Bellowing with mingled fear\r\nand pain, he struck at her with his dagger, but she fell back on her\r\nhaunches, haling him to her. Her grappling-hooks raised him close to\r\nher red jaws. A sudden flash of savage color—and the blades of those\r\njaws sprang apart—another—as they snapped together—a blood-curdling\r\nscream—a sickening gush of blood—then silence. Hosein’s spider had\r\nsacrificed her hundredth man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EDUCATIONAL DEPARTMENT.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGail, Texas, July 15th, 1908.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nEnclosed find $1.00 for which send to my address both publications\r\nWeekly and Monthly for six months, after which I think I can send you\r\nsome subscribers. It was an oversight in not sending it in before now.\r\nIn a little discussion some time back some one spoke of there being no\r\nprivate titles to land in England, and several asked me to write and\r\nask you in regard to the matter.\r\n\r\nI saw enough in your last Magazine to convince me, but would like to\r\nhave you write a piece on the subject.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours respectfully,\r\n                                         THOMAS O. EDWARDS.\r\n\r\n(Answer.)\r\n\r\nThe system of Land Ownership in this country was derived from England.\r\nExcepting crown lands, all real estate in Great Britain is held by\r\nprivate titles. Even entailed estates may be bought and sold but the\r\nprocedure is cumbersome and costly. Stating the case broadly, no poor\r\nman can buy land in England, without the aid of the Government.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the huge estates of the nobles are being purchased by the\r\nGovernment and parcelled out among the people, who buy the land from\r\nthe Government, on long time with low interest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLoganville, Ga., Nov. 9, 1908.\r\n\r\nHon. Thos. E. Watson,\r\n\r\nThomson, Ga.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nPlease answer the following questions in the Jeffersonian or Magazine\r\nor both: Has the Democratic party, at any one time since the Civil War,\r\nbeen in full control of the National Government? If so please give\r\nproof, not that I wouldn’t believe you in every particular, but I want\r\nto prove it to some “hot headed democrats” who don’t want to believe\r\nyou; also please give the time in which they were in control.\r\n\r\nHoping for an immediate reply, I am,\r\n\r\n                                    Yours for the cause,\r\n                                              W. G. STANLEY.\r\n\r\nAnswer:—In 1892, Cleveland was elected President as a Democrat, and\r\nthe Democrats had a majority both in the Senate and in the House during\r\nCleveland’s term of four years, 1892 to 1896.\r\n\r\nThe official records prove this, and no truthful Democrat who is posted\r\nwill dispute the fact. Suppose you refer the skeptics to Senators A. O.\r\nBacon and A. S. Clay.—T. E. W.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= Why is it that the whole world presents the same general\r\npicture of unrest, hard times, business depression, and unemployed\r\nlabor?\r\n\r\n=Answer=: The Kings of High Finance have chained the whole world with\r\nthe gold standard, the effect of which is to contract the currency. A\r\ncontraction of the currency is invariably followed by the same results,\r\nto wit—the ruin of the debtor class, the curtailment of business, the\r\nsuspension of work, and the creation of an army of the unemployed.\r\n\r\nFor three thousand years prior to the discovery of gold in California\r\n(1856) both gold and silver had been in use, over the world, as money\r\nmetals. Now, however, gold alone is the standard of value, and the\r\nmoney of final payment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= Why were gold and silver selected as the money metals?\r\n\r\n=Answer: BECAUSE THEY ARE SCARCE=. By confining money to these two\r\nprecious metals, it was believed by the financiers that the volume of\r\nreal money would never get so large that they could not control it.\r\n=The limitation of money to these two scarce metals was a practical\r\nlimitation to the supply.=\r\n\r\nSo matters stood throughout the world until the discovery of such vast\r\nquantities of gold in California frightened the financiers. They feared\r\nthat so much gold would be added to the currency of the world that\r\nprices would go down, bonds would decrease in value, and that they, the\r\nfinanciers, would be unable to control the supply of real money.\r\n\r\nConsequently, they hired able writers, like Chevalier and MacLarren, TO\r\nWRITE AGAINST GOLD, in the same way that =THE MONEY KINGS HIRED DAVID A.\r\nWELLS AND EDWARD ATKINSON TO WRITE AGAINST SILVER=, more than a century\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nGermany and Austria excluded gold from their mints (1857) and Belgium\r\nand Holland adopted the single silver standard.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= What checked the demonetization of gold?\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the rich silver mines in Nevada, Colorado and other\r\nWestern States. The financiers saw that there would soon be more silver\r\nthan gold, and they went to work to have the scarcer metal made the\r\nstandard of value, and the money of final payment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= What nation led the others in the demonetization of silver?\r\n\r\n=Answer=: Great Britain. She is the nation to whom the people of all\r\nother countries owe most. In other words, the whole world is in debt to\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nTo make this debt harder to pay, Great Britain led the other nations in\r\nthe world-wide war against Bi-metallism, which means the use of both\r\ngold and silver on equal terms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= What is meant by “making the debt harder to pay?”\r\n\r\nA debt, contracted when the volume of currency is expanded by the use\r\nof both gold and silver as monetary metals on equal terms, becomes\r\nharder to pay when the currency is contracted to the use of but one\r\nof these metals. A bond, for instance, issued by the Government when\r\nthe currency is expanded by the use of gold, silver and Greenbacks, is\r\nenormously more valuable after the Government has destroyed a thousand\r\nmillion dollars of the Greenbacks and has demonetized silver. Having\r\nto be paid =THEN= in gold, the bondholder gets money very much more\r\nvaluable than the money he invested in the bond.\r\n\r\nNow Great Britain wanted the nations of the earth to pay the debts they\r\nowed her in money that was more valuable than the money she loaned.\r\nHence, her war upon Bi-metallism.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= But why did other nations help Great Britain demonetize\r\nsilver and establish the single gold standard?\r\n\r\n=Answer=: Because these other nations were controlled by their High\r\nFinance rascals, who wanted to enhance the value of the claims which\r\nthey held against their own Governments and peoples.\r\n\r\nIn each of these other nations, were bondholders and money changers who\r\nwanted to make money scarce, so that they could control it, and so that\r\nthe money paid them to satisfy their claims against the Government and\r\nthe people would be more valuable than that which they had loaned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=QUESTION:= Is there any reason why the amount of metal in a dollar\r\nshould be worth a dollar?\r\n\r\nNone. Money is a man-made product, like a cartwheel. Nature does not\r\nproduce dollars nor cartwheels. Nature supplies the raw materials, but\r\nman is the manufacturer who turns these raw materials into dollars and\r\ncartwheels.\r\n\r\nDollars are made for the purpose of effecting the exchange of one\r\nproduct for another. It is a tool of exchange.\r\n\r\nIt enables Commerce to get along without the bartering of one commodity\r\nfor another. In old times, a man who did not have a horse but wanted\r\none, would get one in exchange for cows, of which he had more than he\r\nneeded. There was inconvenience about this, because the man who had a\r\nhorse that he was willing to swap for cows might not be easy to find.\r\nTo get away from the cumbersome, unsatisfactory system of Barter,\r\nmen agreed on something that should represent value in exchange. The\r\nsubstance agreed on, no matter what it was, became money.\r\n\r\nTherefore, money was made by man for the special purpose of carrying on\r\nCommerce, just as wheels are made to carry on carts, wagons, carriages\r\nand railroad cars.\r\n\r\nThere is no more sense in claiming that the dollar—which is the wheel\r\nof Commerce—should be made out of a material of any particular value\r\nthan there would be in claiming that a car wheel shall bear a certain\r\nproportion of value to the freight which is transported in the car.\r\n\r\nThe dollar is a tool, in the same sense that a hoe is a tool. With\r\none hoe, you may cultivate cotton worth fifty dollars; but that is no\r\nreason why the hoe should cost you fifty dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TWO HANDS\r\n\r\nOne Controls the Wealth; The Other Produces It]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoney Is King\r\n\r\n\r\nBY WALTER EDEN\r\n\r\nThe mighty King is an exacting Tyrant. All things are dominated by\r\nmoney. It shapes the destinies of Nations. It rules trade and gives\r\nlife or death to all enterprise, as it sees fit. In the hands of\r\nunscrupulous men it is the greatest known power for evil. Properly\r\ncurbed and free from the manipulation of designing hands it may be made\r\nthe greatest known power for good.\r\n\r\nThe American people seek by law to control the trusts. They legislate\r\nto regulate Inter-state commerce and to punish rebating and unlawful\r\nrestraint of trade. They give us tariff laws and levy Internal revenue\r\ntaxes, to raise money with which to pay the expenses of government. Our\r\ncountry is quadrennially thrown into a spasm of political excitement to\r\nsettle these and other great political questions.\r\n\r\nStandards of value are discussed, and any standard thus far proclaimed\r\nis shown to be unstable, fluctuating, wrongful and hurtful. Much has\r\nbeen made and lost in the past by reason of the fluctuation in the\r\nvalue of the standard of money, be it a single gold standard or a\r\ndouble standard. Government ownership is advocated by some as a panacea\r\nfor all of our political ills. Currency, it is said, should be more\r\nelastic.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the discussion and legislation of and concerning\r\nall these, and kindred questions, for more than a century, our body\r\npolitic seems still to be sick, and like leprosy and the great white\r\nplague, no known remedy has been discovered for or applied to the\r\npatient.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of the nation has been, and is now being, concentrated in\r\nthe hands of a few. Individuals have been, and are now, accumulating\r\nsuch vast fortunes that our President has advocated a course that\r\namounts to confiscation, as the only remedy for the evil.\r\n\r\nThe money market can be so manipulated by a few men, that they are\r\nable, at pleasure, to make or unmake panics; to stagnate business; to\r\nappreciate or depreciate the value of stocks and bonds, and to cause\r\nuntold suffering to the people. Innocent investors are carried from\r\ntheir feet by the maelstrom of speculation in money.\r\n\r\nNo great enterprise, be it for the public good or not, can be\r\naccomplished without first obtaining the consent of a few men who\r\ncontrol the money market. A few millions of actual investment in\r\nRailroad stock, it has been demonstrated, can be manipulated so as to\r\ncontrol stacks of railroads amounting to over a billion dollars; when\r\nthe maturing crop of the farmer is ready for the market, the volume of\r\ncurrency in circulation is not great enough to move the crop to market,\r\nand the men in power reap large profits out of the money furnished for\r\nthis purpose. A panic follows and the farmer is made to suffer and\r\neither hold his grain or sell it on a declining market.\r\n\r\nThe control of this greatest of all powers on earth should be taken\r\nfrom the hands of the few and deposited where it belongs, viz., into\r\nthe hands of the Government. When this shall have been done all the\r\nills which flow from this source will be healed.\r\n\r\nIt has been well said by the immortal Lincoln that this is a government\r\nof the people, by the people and for the people; and yet, we find that\r\nthe place where there is the most need of governing the people for the\r\ngreatest benefit of the whole people has been neglected.\r\n\r\nMoney is the controlling factor of all human agencies. Regulate it, and\r\na proper regulation of most great evils will naturally follow.\r\n\r\nMoney is controlled by the banker, not because he owns all the money\r\nwhich he controls; but because the masses of the people deposit their\r\nmoney with him and thus he gains power over not only the little capital\r\nwhich he invests in the stock of the bank, but over the very large\r\nvolume of deposits which his many customers leave with him.\r\n\r\nThe great power of the banker is a power placed in his hands by the\r\npeople. The money which really gives him power is not his own, but\r\nbelongs to the depositor.\r\n\r\nIf this great power were given by the people to our Government, it\r\nwould be more impartially exerted, because the Government is the\r\npeople. The people would thus be protected from loss of deposits\r\nby failing banks, absconding bankers and rascally bank officials.\r\nCombinations of the people’s money in the hands of a few men, to\r\nbenefit the few men at the expense of the people would cease.\r\n\r\nWhen a condition exists that is a menace to the people, a condition\r\nthat is being taken advantage of by certain individuals to the\r\ndetriment of the great mass of people, it is the right and the duty of\r\nthe Government to enact such laws as will eradicate the nuisance if it\r\ncan be done.\r\n\r\nA banking scheme can be devised that will accomplish this beneficent\r\npurpose. Under it an elastic currency can be established, a\r\nnon-fluctuating standard can be provided for, the tax gatherer can\r\nbe made to disappear, panics cease, depositors will be protected and\r\nunlawful combinations in restraint of trade be a thing of the past.\r\n\r\nPut the Government into the banking business and the thing will be\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nIt may be charged that the scheme is too radical. It may seem so, but\r\nnothing is too radical that is right. It will be a very great change\r\nfrom the present system, and will be opposed by all the force and power\r\nof organized wealth.\r\n\r\nIt may be charged that it is not authorized by the constitution. If it\r\nis right, change the constitution. It won’t be the first time it has\r\nbeen changed. At one time the negro was a slave with no more rights\r\nunder our constitution than an animal. Today, by reason of a change in\r\nour constitution, he has all the rights of citizenship and stands on an\r\nequality before the law with his white brother.\r\n\r\nLet the General Government, the State, the County and the municipality\r\nget together and go into the banking business. Does it not look too\r\nvast to be comprehended? Think about it a while, Mr. American Citizen.\r\nDon’t brush aside the idea without consideration, but if you are not\r\ninterested in opposing the plan, and will give the matter a little\r\nthought, you will see the advantages of the proposed system.\r\n\r\nThomas W. Lawson was at one time opposing the present system; he laid\r\nbare many of the fraudulent and unlawful outrages perpetrated by it,\r\nwhich the system of Government bankers, if established, will be able\r\nto prevent. Take the present system, which he has so ably shown to be\r\nnoxious, and transfer it from the hands of the individuals into the\r\nhands of the Government, and this great power, now exercised by the\r\nfew, will be placed in the hands of the people, where it justly belongs.\r\n\r\nGive the General Government at Washington, under the supervision of\r\nthe Treasury department of the United States, banking powers. Let\r\nit organize a central bank, with power to supervise and control all\r\nthe lesser banks proposed to be organized by States, Counties, and\r\nmunicipalities. Provide by law for the opening of a bank in each state,\r\nunder the control of the State, but to be tributary to the Central bank\r\nat Washington, each to be known as a United States Bank of Illinois, or\r\nthe state in which the same is located.\r\n\r\nProvide also for tributary banks in each County, to be known as a\r\nUnited States Bank of the County in which the same is situated, with\r\ngeneral banking power; it being optional, however, with each state\r\nto pass laws to avail itself of the banking privilege or not, as its\r\nlegislative body may see fit; this option also to extend to each County.\r\n\r\nMake a provision that the Central bank at Washington shall receive\r\ndeposits from County Banks and issue Government bonds for the amount\r\nof the deposit; the County Bank then to be empowered to issue notes,\r\nsimilar to the present National Bank Notes, to be used as a circulating\r\ncurrency among the people, to the extent of its Government bonds,\r\ndepositing the bonds with the Central bank as a security.\r\n\r\nGive the County Bank general banking power, to receive deposits, draw\r\nexchange and loan money on real estate, chattel and personal security,\r\nunder proper regulations.\r\n\r\nIn Counties where the privilege of engaging in the banking business\r\nshall have been availed of, branch banks of the County Bank may be\r\norganized in such localities of the County as the County Bank may\r\ndetermine is necessary or expedient, with the same banking powers as\r\nthe County Bank.\r\n\r\nGive to the County Banks and their branches, in addition to the\r\ngeneral banking powers, power to execute Trusts, act as Executor,\r\nAdministrator, Guardian and Conservator.\r\n\r\nGive to the County Bank, in addition to its regular issue of bank\r\nnotes, power to issue, at any time the exigencies of the times may\r\nrequire, other bank notes, to an amount not exceeding a certain per\r\ncent of the assessed valuation of all real and personal property of\r\nthe County, for the year such assessment was last made for taxation,\r\nupon payment to the General Government of such per centum on said\r\ncirculating notes as will insure their prompt recall whenever the\r\nemergency which called for their issue shall have passed.\r\n\r\nLet the funds deposited with the Central Bank at Washington, by the\r\nvarious Counties, and for which Government Bonds shall issue, be\r\nloaned out by such Central Bank, at a reasonable rate of interest,\r\nsufficiently high to produce a profit, to enterprises of an inter-state\r\ncharacter, such as railroads and other large borrowers; and let the\r\nsame be invested in stocks and bonds of known stability in large\r\namounts; thus furnishing a fund to be used in large enterprises,\r\nand relieving the promoters of such undertakings from being under\r\nthe control of a few individual money lenders, and at the same time\r\nfurnishing a source of profitable investment of the people’s money.\r\n\r\nThe various state banks may be simply branches or departments of the\r\nCentral Bank at Washington.\r\n\r\nSuch State Banks may receive deposits from the various County Banks of\r\nany state as a medium of exchange, and the same may be loaned under\r\nthe direction of the Central Bank, the same as the proceeds of sale of\r\nGovernment Bonds, but they shall be required to keep constantly on hand\r\na certain per cent thereof, to be fixed by law, to pay exchange.\r\n\r\nThe profit of the Central Bank shall be paid into the Treasury of the\r\nUnited States to defray the expenses of the Government so far as the\r\nsame will apply.\r\n\r\nThe profit of the State Banks, if there be any, shall be paid into\r\nthe Treasury of the States respectively; and used to pay the current\r\nexpenses of the State, as far as the same will apply.\r\n\r\nThe profit of the various County Banks shall, after paying a certain\r\nper cent thereof, to be fixed by law, into the Treasury of the State in\r\nwhich such County is situate, be paid to the Treasurer of such County,\r\nto defray the expenses of the said County. And any sum so paid by any\r\nCounty into the State Treasury, to be deducted from the taxes levied in\r\nsaid County for State purposes.\r\n\r\nState Banks shall be only branches of the Central Bank and shall be a\r\npart of the same.\r\n\r\nCounty Banks shall be subject to examination and supervision by the\r\nGovernment of the United States.\r\n\r\nThese observations may be crude, but certainly they are worthy of\r\nconsideration. Is the general idea not worthy of attention?\r\n\r\nPerhaps much that has been suggested should be eliminated entirely;\r\nmuch probably should be changed; much more perhaps should be added.\r\n\r\nTime and trial of the system would bring to mind many good ideas.\r\nConsider it and see if a little thought given to the matter won’t make\r\nit look feasible and open up a much wider field for thought than merely\r\nthe idea of a people’s bank.\r\n\r\nWhat are the possibilities of some such system? Not only what are the\r\npossibilities, but if you please, what are the probabilities as to the\r\nresults that would follow such a system?\r\n\r\nIt will settle the Trust Question because, it will take the control\r\nof money from the men who are interested in the Trusts, and thus\r\nenable competition to the Trusts to borrow money with which to go into\r\nbusiness in opposition to them.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly be possible, under present conditions, for a person\r\nor syndicate to sell bonds to supply the money with which to go into\r\nbusiness in competition with the Standard Oil Company. The men who are\r\nin control of the money market would not dare to incur the ill will\r\nof such a powerful influence as that which is behind the Standard, by\r\nbuying bonds of a rival concern. The men who are interested in such\r\ngigantic Trusts are the ones who control the money of the Country. So\r\nit is with competing lines of railroads. The men who now are in control\r\nof the through lines of railroad have too much influence over the money\r\nmarket to permit competing lines to be built.\r\n\r\nGive to the Government banking power, with local County Banks, and the\r\ncurrency question will settle itself. The much talked of standard of\r\nvalue will become fixed. The currency will be made as elastic as the\r\nexigencies of the times shall demand.\r\n\r\nWe will have not only gold and silver for a basis but as well all of\r\nthe broad acres of fertile land, the mines, the grain, the horses,\r\ncattle, hogs and sheep, in fact everything that goes upon the\r\nassessor’s book will stand behind the dollar. For the County and the\r\nGovernment will guarantee it.\r\n\r\nIt will be elastic because each particular locality will have the\r\npower to issue emergency currency to meet the immediate needs of the\r\ncommunity. The County with all its property will stand behind it,\r\nand surely all of the land and property in the County will furnish a\r\nsufficient security to make good a sufficient volume of currency to get\r\nthe product of farm, or mine or manufactory to the market.\r\n\r\nIt will furnish a security to the depositor and thus keep the money\r\nwhich should be in circulation from being hoarded; for the man who\r\nhas a little money will have no fear of depositing it. A banking law\r\nrecently enacted in Oklahoma has been much praised because the state\r\nguarantees the deposits. How much better would be a law which provides\r\nthat in return for the guarantee of the deposits the State shall take\r\ndown the profits of the business. Is it right that the State should\r\ntake all the risk of losses and not share in the profits?\r\n\r\nIt will settle the much disputed Tariff Question, because the profits\r\narising from the banking business will probably pay all the running\r\nexpenses of the Government, and leave a balance besides.\r\n\r\nIf this should prove to be true the Custom house can be abolished and\r\nthere will be no necessity of levying tribute on imports.\r\n\r\nIt will settle the question of Internal Revenue taxes, for the\r\nGovernment will need no longer to shock the tender sensibility of the\r\nProhibitionist by levying tribute on the vile Demon to support itself.\r\n\r\nIt may, eventually, lead to the Government ownership in such a gradual\r\nmanner that it will not unsettle the business interests of the Country,\r\nfor as the revenues produced from the profits of the banking business\r\nincrease in excess of the expenses of Government, the same can be\r\ninvested in bonds and stocks of the Public Utilities from time to time,\r\nuntil after a number of years they would naturally be absorbed by the\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe local tax collector can be discharged and our direct tax on lands\r\nand chattels will cease, as the profit to each County will more than\r\npay the expenses of the County, including State taxes.\r\n\r\nExamine the published and sworn statement of all the local banks in\r\nyour County, and figure a reasonable rate of interest on the deposits\r\nalone, not including capital stock and other sources of revenue, and\r\nyou will find a profit per annum of more than sufficient to defray the\r\nexpenses of your County, including maintenance of schools and roads and\r\nbridges.\r\n\r\nThis scheme may seem visionary at first, and not feasible, but think it\r\nover. Don’t dismiss the idea without a thought. Surely it is worth some\r\nconsideration. Perhaps you may get some good idea from it.\r\n\r\nBankers will dismiss the idea, of course, as not being worthy of\r\nconsideration. Money lenders will oppose it. Large capitalists will\r\ntreat it lightly. To the man, however, who is interested in Government\r\nof the people, by the people, for the people, free from any personal\r\nadvantage, it will surely merit your consideration.\r\n\r\nGovernments are formed to regulate society and to protect the weak\r\nagainst the strong. That was the prime object of Government. That which\r\nvitally affects the public is proper subject of legislation. If a wrong\r\nis being perpetrated it should be righted by law. The people have\r\nthe right to expect this to be done. They have it in their power to\r\nregulate this greatest of all necessities, money.\r\n\r\nOne hears a great deal said about the necessaries of life. We talk of\r\nraiment to clothe us, houses to shelter us, food to satisfy our hunger\r\nand fuel to keep us warm, as the necessaries of life, but none of these\r\nthings can be counted as any more necessary than money, for before we\r\ncan procure these things we must first have money. It is the first\r\nnecessity of life. Is it not proper that it should be put under the\r\ncontrol of our Government and its control taken out of the hands of the\r\nfew?\r\n\r\nLet all the people control, by means of a proper Government, this first\r\ngreat necessity.\r\n\r\nPeople’s banks will protect the depositor and make his deposit secure.\r\n\r\nPeople’s banks will relieve the borrower from the money shark and\r\nusurer, as a fixed legal rate of interest only will be charged.\r\n\r\nLet us have people’s banks, and the power of money, which is now given\r\nby the millions of depositors in this Country to a few men, will be\r\ntaken out of the hands of the few and returned to the people through\r\ntheir Government. Wall Street will be transferred to Washington.\r\n\r\nLet us have people’s banks and the investor will not be crushed to the\r\nwall by a panic, as they will be a thing of the past. Investments will\r\nbe more stable and more secure.\r\n\r\nThe standard of value will be fixed for all time, tariff laws will need\r\nno amending and changing from time to time, and cause restlessness and\r\nuneasiness in the public mind, and every man will have an even chance\r\nwith every other man in his race for a livelihood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_A DWELLER WITH THE PAST._\r\n\r\n\r\n    From cabin crude on lonely height—\r\n    Eyes piercing keen the solitude—\r\n    She gazes at the scarce-worn pass,\r\n    Where shadows ceaseless bend and brood.\r\n\r\n    A soft caress, a word or two,—\r\n    The pleasuring thing danced on its way;\r\n    But to her, guileless child, it seemed\r\n    That blossoms bright fell from the day.\r\n\r\n    She sighs, the sputtering wick burns low,\r\n    The night wind bends the long hill grass,\r\n    And the soul of that fleeting bygone day\r\n    Glides noiseless o’er the rock-ribbed pass.\r\n                                 Ricardo Minor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClippings from Exchanges\r\n\r\n\r\nOSCAR HAMMERSTEIN.\r\n\r\nAn old Yankee fisherman up in Maine said to his son who was starting\r\nout to seek his fortune, “Sonnie, mind what I tell ye, in this here\r\nworld you’ve either got to cut bait or fish.” Oscar Hammerstein,\r\nhumorist, father of six children, plunger, man of business, cigar\r\nmachine inventor, real estate speculator, vaudeville manager, composer,\r\ntheater builder and impresario, is one of the men who fishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OSCAR HAMMERSTEIN]\r\n\r\nHe fishes where he pleases, when he pleases, and how he pleases. “He\r\nwants what he wants when he wants it,” and what’s more he gets it. When\r\nhe wants to do a thing he asks Oscar Hammerstein’s advice. If Oscar\r\nHammerstein says go ahead he goes ahead.\r\n\r\nThis man has the faculty of disembodying himself. He looks upon himself\r\nobjectively. He has implicit confidence in Oscar Hammerstein—in his\r\njudgment, in his courage, in his indomitable perseverance, in his star.\r\nThe psychologists talk about the subliminal self. It is some such self\r\nwhich is Oscar Hammerstein’s guide, philosopher, friend, and mentor.\r\n\r\nI asked Mr. Hammerstein if he had a Board of Directors. He replied,\r\n“Certainly; see that long table there with all those chairs round it?\r\nThose chairs are my directors. I sit at the head of that table and vote\r\nmyself a salary of $150,000 and my Directors pass it unanimously. I\r\nsuggest; they approve.”\r\n\r\nOne day about forty-three years ago a rich father Hammerstein in\r\nBerlin cruelly beat a young Hammerstein with a skate strap. That young\r\nHammerstein was Oscar, and he decided he had had enough of that sort of\r\nthing. Taking his father’s violin he escaped from the music room where\r\nhe was imprisoned. Selling the violin for thirty dollars he bought a\r\nsteerage passage on a sailing ship bound for America. He says of this\r\nincident:\r\n\r\n“I landed on these shores covered with vermin and without a cent. After\r\na time I came to a sign which read, ‘Cigar Makers Wanted. Paid While\r\nYou Learn.’ So I went in and applied for a job—not because I had\r\nany passion for making cigars, but because I didn’t want to starve.”\r\nWithin a short time this two-dollar-a-week cigar maker’s apprentice had\r\ninvented a machine for binding cigar fillers which he sold for $6,000.\r\n\r\nHis many inventions have revolutionized the entire cigar making\r\nindustry. He has now a music room and a machine shop. After three in\r\nthe afternoon he divides his time between composing and inventing. Mr.\r\nHammerstein is a man who makes and loses fortunes. The last time he\r\nwent under was about ten years ago, when his great three part Olympia\r\nTheater failed utterly. He said, “That cleaned me out—lost one million\r\nand a half. I realized that after the things were sold at auction I\r\nwouldn’t have a dollar. Even to pay the rent for my modest apartment\r\nwas a problem.”\r\n\r\n“What did you do?”\r\n\r\n“Do! I lit a cigar and took a long walk.”\r\n\r\n“How did you feel—discouraged?”\r\n\r\n“Felt fine! Discouraged, not a bit! I’ve never in my life felt\r\ndiscouraged or despondent. I’m something of a victim of melancholy, but\r\nthat has nothing whatever to do with external events. It comes over\r\nme when my affairs are prospering most. But I’ve never been afraid of\r\nanybody or anything.\r\n\r\n“What I did is too long a story. But mark this! If you have an honest\r\nconviction as to the right thing to do you can do it! If you have\r\nabsolute faith in yourself, other people are bound to have faith in\r\nyou. No question about it.”\r\n\r\nLater one of Mr. Hammerstein’s assistants told me one thing he did\r\nin this emergency. He sold his grand piano and with the proceeds as\r\nhis capital started the great Victoria vaudeville theater on Long\r\nAcre Square. Its out of the way site alone irrevocably condemned it\r\nto failure in the opinion of all the theatrical experts except its\r\nbuilder. One of his sons is now running it with immense success.\r\n\r\n“I have only one partner,” continued Mr. Hammerstein—“my knowledge of\r\nhuman nature. I have the greatest conductor in the world—Campanini.\r\nI went to Europe and saw him conduct and decided I must have him. I\r\nmet him and made him believe in me and he came. He had never heard of\r\nOscar Hammerstein. I didn’t show him my bank book. It wouldn’t have\r\nimpressed him if I had. It was the same way with Madame Melba and with\r\nall the others. They liked me, they believed in me, and they came with\r\nme. They won’t sing for a man they don’t believe in, no matter how many\r\nthousands he may offer them.\r\n\r\n“When I started this opera house over here my friends were on the\r\npoint of engaging a cell for me at Matteawan. Now my opera is a great\r\nsuccess. With the exception of Caruso the Metropolitan singers can’t\r\ncompare with mine. Of course, there’s not much money in this business.\r\nIf money was what I wanted I should sell suspenders or shoe strings.\r\n\r\n“No, I never asked or took anybody’s advice about anything in my life.\r\nWhy should I? I know my own affairs better than anybody else can. I\r\nhave no secretary. I have no bookkeeper. Of course I have a treasurer\r\nto handle the funds. I haven’t even a stenographer.”\r\n\r\n“Why should I sit here and waste my time dictating letters about\r\nmatters that don’t concern me to people that don’t interest me. When a\r\nletter really requires an answer I write a few lines in pencil on the\r\nletter itself and send it back to the writer. Here’s my letter file,”\r\npointing to a capacious waste-basket, “and a very good one it makes.\r\nI never could understand why people should feel obliged to answer\r\nletters. All sorts of people write me about their affairs—not mine!\r\nWhy should I spend my time writing people about their own affairs? Of\r\ncourse, helping people who deserve it is quite another matter.\r\n\r\n“One quality that has always helped me immensely is my\r\nfaculty—absolutely—to wipe the past from my mind. I look only to the\r\nfuture. I work only for the future. I drag no dead weights after me.\r\nBut, no man knows why he does things. He can’t help expressing what\r\nis in him. The genius or talent or aptitude or whatever you call it,\r\nthat is born in him is bound to come out no matter what his outward\r\ncircumstances. The people who never discover their bent have none\r\nto discover. If you are a reporter and you don’t like the way your\r\nfountain pen works you make it work better. You invent another pen; and\r\nthen, before you know it, you find yourself a pen manufacturer.”\r\n\r\nWith twinkling eyes and one of his contagious, boyish laughs Mr.\r\nHammerstein got up from his desk and said, “Now I must excuse\r\nmyself to attend one of those Directors’ meetings I was telling you\r\nabout.”—Lyman Beecher Stowe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MAGIC MOMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n(By Lilian Whiting.)\r\n\r\n    I love you, love you! only this\r\n            I have to say;\r\n    All other visions, hopes and dreams\r\n            Must go their way.\r\n\r\n    Your lightest word outweighs for me\r\n            The universe beside;\r\n    My thought responds to all your own\r\n            As ocean’s tide\r\n\r\n    Unfailingly leaps up to meet\r\n            The moon’s sure call;\r\n    Or as the stars in evening skies\r\n            Must shine for all.\r\n\r\n    Life is no longer drift and dream,\r\n            But vivified;\r\n    And all its radiance, all its faiths,\r\n            Are multiplied.\r\n\r\n    Music and magic lay their spell\r\n            Upon the days\r\n    That dawn in rose and wane in gold\r\n            And purple haze.\r\n\r\n    O wondrous spirit-call that came\r\n            From out the air\r\n    To make all life forevermore\r\n            Divinely fair.\r\n                      —Harper’s Bazaar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKEEP POPULIST CHICKS AT HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe editor of the Lawton Weekly Democrat, in commenting on the election\r\nsaid, “Some time ago we borrowed a Rooster from the News-Republican,\r\nto use in celebrating the Democratic victory we just knew was going\r\nto take place November 3rd. However, about 9 o’clock Tuesday night\r\nour Rooster began to feel unwell and we called in medical assistance,\r\nsat up with him all night; but shortly before noon on Wednesday he\r\nturned over on his back and uttered a feeble good bye.

H. Harriman has found himself blocked. The laws of Texas\r\nprotect investors by prohibiting mergers with large systems, and Texas\r\nlaws further require that all railroads within her borders shall be\r\nowned and operated by local corporations. Every State in the Union\r\ncould have protected its citizens by such laws and prevented gigantic\r\nmergers of Harriman, Hill et al.\r\n\r\nThe anti-corporation wave that is sweeping over the Lone Star State\r\nwill not quickly subside and if Harriman thinks that he can re-arrange\r\nthe laws of Texas to suit his convenience he fails to realize that he\r\nmust reckon with a people who are not owned by monopoly.\r\n\r\nThe Espee does not select the Governor of Texas at a dinner in New York\r\na year in advance of the election, neither does it control the Railroad\r\nCommission, the Legislature or the Courts of that State. It is one\r\nof the chief beneficiaries of the system of centralism that has been\r\nfastened upon some of the States, notably California and Nevada.\r\n\r\nIt is gratifying to know that there is one State strong enough to check\r\nthe octopus and prevent a combine of the railroad lines within its\r\nborders to the injury of the many and the benefit of the few.—The San\r\nBernardina (Cal.)

Already\r\nwe are learning to value the birds for their usefulness as destroyers\r\nof harmful insects, and coming to appreciate the beauty and wonder of\r\nthe life that belongs to the little wild animals in our woods.

If this statement had been made two, or even one,\r\nyear ago, it could have been overlooked.\r\n\r\nTo say that the farmer is in good shape now, or words to that effect,\r\nis a great deal more misleading than the above epigram. The writer\r\nlives in one of the very best and most progressive farming sections\r\nof the state. He comes in daily contact with the farmer. Taking the\r\nconditions that exist here as an example, we find the farmers as\r\na whole in worse shape than they have been in several years. As a\r\nconsequence of this those who depend on the farmer, as most everybody\r\ndoes in the small towns, are in worse shape than the farmer. The\r\nGeorgian gives as a reason for the good condition in which the farmer\r\nfinds himself, that they are diversifying their crops. Our observation\r\nthat his failure to diversify is the main cause of his helpless\r\ncondition now. Too much cotton has broken, in a sense, the backbone\r\nof the country, and, as Mr. Watson remarks, it is afflicted with a\r\ncomplicated case of spinal trouble.\r\n\r\nThe Georgian merely has a pipe dream of what should be, and what would\r\nbe if the farmer would diversify, and arrives at the conclusion that it\r\nalready exists.—Royston Record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CURSE OF THE NATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe banker organizes a national bank having $100,000 capital, with\r\nwhich he buys $100,000 of United States bonds, “on which he draws\r\ninterest in advance and pays no tax.” The government engraves, prints,\r\nand sends him notes to be used as money, to the face value of the\r\nbonds. Nominally these notes cost him $5.00 a thousand. He lends them\r\nout at from six to ten per cent on the thousand, or from sixty to one\r\nhundred dollars on the thousand. Then by a system of bank credits,\r\nwhich would be incredible if it were not so capable of proof, he\r\nmultiplies his loans until he draws interest on NINE times more money\r\nthan he ever put into his business.\r\n\r\nTo cap the climax, he gets the Government to surrender its revenue\r\nto his keeping, lends out these millions also, ... DRAWING ANOTHER\r\nINTEREST FROM THE TAX PAYERS WHOSE OWN MONEY HE IS LENDING BACK TO THEM.\r\n\r\nWhat a mockery of equal and exact justice! What do you think of your\r\nold party representatives’ business ability, who issue United States\r\nbonds at 2, 3, or 4 per cent and turn around and loan it to the\r\nbankers at one-half of one per cent? With their twenty-five per cent\r\nreserves loaned to other banks and loaned to the gamblers of Wall\r\nstreet, as well as to the ones operating a gambling hell of the like\r\nkind in every large city, sending call money to eighty and more per\r\ncent. “And at last the chickens come home to roost, ... when the bogus\r\ndollars come to the doors of the bank clamoring for recognition and\r\nredemption, these silk hat thieves get together, refuse to honor their\r\nown notes, refuse to pay depositors, decline to cash checks; issue a\r\nnasty Clearing House Certificate, compel the business world to accept\r\nit as money, and thus MAKE ANOTHER PROFIT OUT OF THE WRITTEN EVIDENCE\r\nOF THEIR OWN DISHONESTY.” The United States bonds are a first liability\r\nof the Government. The National Bank notes are a second liability, and\r\nthese pawnbrokers of a nation’s energy and productiveness propose a\r\nthird liability based on your deposits and their capital, called for\r\neuphony, asset currency (asses’ money). This is the way they want to\r\nget the elastic currency (rubber money) whereby the exceeding hard\r\nwork of the banker is to sign his name to thousand dollar bills and\r\nget in exchange your hard labor, inventive ability, and its products.\r\nThey tell you to “work hard, save your money, and put it in the bank.”\r\nWhy should your government tax you for their benefit, when you can do\r\nit directly without them? “Is it ‘equal and exact justice’ to allow\r\nsix thousand national bankers to turn your credit into a mint for\r\nthemselves, at your expense? Is there any defense of a system which\r\nturns Government credit and cash over to a favored few?” “They say\r\ntheir issue of money is good,” but your Government issuing money to you\r\ndirect is “repudiation and national dishonor.” “Money is the life-blood\r\nof trade.” Will you leave in the hands of these pawnbrokers the power\r\nto cut your business in half, curtail enterprise, reduce the workers’\r\nwages, and diminish thereby the markets of the country?\r\n\r\nThe Peoples’ Party position on the money question is based on the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court’s decision, in The Legal Tender cases of\r\n1862 and 1863, as well as the Supreme Courts of nineteen Northern\r\nStates.—Ohio Liberty Bell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamb In the Rain\r\n\r\n\r\n    How sweet a tune it was to cuddle down to\r\n    Under the big star quilt that grandma made,\r\n    The rain upon the roof! enough to drown you—\r\n    And we made out, you know, we were afraid.\r\n\r\n    And then you wondered—and the thought would wake you\r\n    Wide awake a moment with its pain,\r\n    If there could be—and how your heart would ache you—\r\n    A little lamb somewhere out in the rain.\r\n\r\n    And so, when mother came—how mothers love you!\r\n    To kiss her good-night kiss, you’d question low\r\n    And when she told you—bending there above you—\r\n    “All little lambs are in,” you knew ’twas so.\r\n\r\n    How in your very heart of hearts you’d thank her!\r\n    For all your little throat just ached to weep;\r\n    Then, with a few deep breaths that dragged their anchor,\r\n    Your tender heart and you were fast asleep.\r\n\r\n    Again the rain upon the roof is beating;\r\n    O Heart, dear Heart, I hear you where I am;\r\n    And all your mother-soul’s incessant bleating\r\n    For yours—your own unsheltered little lamb!\r\n\r\n    But look, dear Heart, dear Heart, one bends above you\r\n    With more than mother-tenderness to kiss\r\n    Your soul into assurance; mother love you?—\r\n    Ah, gentler than her gentlest love is this!\r\n\r\n    Look, to His Heart your little one lies closer\r\n    Than even to your own heart hath it been!\r\n    Confide it, little mater dolorosa,\r\n    And rest; for know “All little lambs are in.”\r\n\r\n    White Springs, Fla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LETTERS FROM THE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\nTHOS.

Would to God that such a fight could be made in every state\r\nin the Union. It would, and I believe that it will anyhow, sweep the\r\ncountry within a shorter time than most of us dream of. Down at heart\r\nthe great mass of the people are Populists and what a people are at\r\nheart is bound to reach the head in time.\r\n\r\nThe sophistry of Mr. Bryan having now been exploded, Populism will\r\nagain get its old time consideration. Millions of voters were, by\r\nMr. Bryan’s boyhood days’ stand, led to believe that he was really a\r\nPopulist, which now stands so plainly refuted that no man ought longer\r\nbe fooled unless he wants to be.\r\n\r\nThe suggestion on your part to call a conference would, I believe,\r\nprove a good move. As a meeting place, the farther South and West, the\r\nbetter. It would bring you closer to the great mass of voters who know\r\nmore what Populism means than we do of the East and North.\r\n\r\nWhat little I can do for the cause, I shall most gladly do. Always at\r\nyour command, allowed my name to be used here in the last election as a\r\ncandidate for Assembly. Got 138 votes in the county; more than enough\r\nthat our party will hereafter have a place on the ticket without having\r\nto get out a petition.\r\n\r\nWith best wishes and a God speed you in the noble work engaged, I am,\r\n\r\n                                    Very truly yours,\r\n                                               WILLIAM LOOSER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT SHOULD ISSUE ALL MONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMilitary Home, Dayton, O.\r\n\r\nOct. 20, 1908.\r\n\r\nThomas E. Watson,\r\n\r\nThomsan, Ga.\r\n\r\nSir:\r\n\r\nYou know as well as I do that were it not for England’s paper money,\r\nNapoleon would not have lost the battle of Waterloo. Would it not be\r\nwise, and acceptable to all, to, in your speeches, advocate the issue\r\nof Greenbacks exclusively by the Federal Government? Answer, Yes or No.\r\n\r\n                                       Respectfully,\r\n                                               CAPT. A. R. TITUS.\r\n\r\n(Yes.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nONLY QUESTION WORTH WHILE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDenver, Col., Oct. 13, 1908.\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas E. Watson,\r\n\r\nThomson, Ga.\r\n\r\nFriend Watson:\r\n\r\nI want to compliment you on the splendid work you are doing in your\r\npublications. I am glad you give space to the money question, for it\r\nis really the only question worth while. With an insufficient money\r\nsupply no economic system, however good, will succeed. No matter how\r\nhigh an ethical standard we may have or how industrious the people\r\nmay be, poverty will stalk through the land if we do not have a money\r\nvolume equal to our money needs. Our money shortage begets interest\r\nand the consumer pays all interest in commercial transactions. What is\r\nour money shortage? I place it at not less than fifteen billion. We\r\ncould use thirteen billion for the one purpose of conserving wealth,\r\nand we could certainly use two billion in active circulation. Our bank\r\ndeposits were more than thirteen billion, and we had less than three\r\nbillion in circulation. The fact that we can and do use credit to help\r\nout the money shortage, does not alter the fact that we should have\r\ntangible money to use instead of being forced to use credit, which\r\nalways carries with it the =interest= charge.\r\n\r\nBut enough of this. No answer expected, though I do appreciate a letter\r\nfrom you. I know your time is too precious. A man that writes for\r\nmillions now and millions yet to come can not afford to write to one\r\nlone person, and I think you are =writing for the ages=.\r\n\r\n                                   Yours with best wishes,\r\n                                                RICHARD WOLFE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWE ALSO WISH IT.\r\n\r\n\r\nLuzerne, N. Y., Oct. 24, 1908.\r\n\r\nHon. Thomas E. Watson,\r\n\r\nThomson, Ga.\r\n\r\nDear Sir:\r\n\r\nI wish it were possible for you to make sufficient inroads in the\r\nSouth to help build up a great new party which would have some honest\r\nconvictions as to the people’s right to rule themselves, a democracy of\r\nvital grip.\r\n\r\n                                          Success to you,\r\n                                                  GEO. THOMAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FINE LETTER FROM MRS. MARION TODD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpringport, Mich., Dec. 16, 1908.\r\n\r\nMy Dear Mr. Watson:\r\n\r\nAnything that appears to have your endorsement is worthy of\r\nconsideration, and, as the language of Dr. S. Leland, in your last\r\nMagazine, in his speech refers to woman in an offensive manner, I\r\ninflict this article upon you and consider it only fair that it be\r\nplaced before the same readers. Dr. Leland refers to woman in the\r\nfollowing language:\r\n\r\n“They will be anything for love, and if they can’t get that * * * some\r\nwill rush into the lecture field—join the Salvation Army—form Women’s\r\nRights Societies, and do deeds that make the angels weep.”\r\n\r\nIt’s not surprising that women join the Salvation Army, since it’s an\r\nArmy that has done more good than all the churches on earth have ever\r\ndone; but what really puzzles me is how Dr. Leland happened to know\r\nthat the angels weep because women rush into the lecture field—form\r\nWomen’s Rights Societies, etc. Was he so close to the angels that he\r\ncould hear the rustle of their wings? There is no known record of\r\nangels weeping over woman suffrage societies, etc. The only thing\r\nthat approaches a record of weeping angels is, that Lucifer, in his\r\ntilt with heavenly comrades, =might= have wept, not because of woman\r\nsuffrage societies, evidently, but probably because he happened to be\r\nkicked over the battlements of Glory. We hope Dr. Leland, who is now\r\ndead, found better favor in the beyond than did Lucifer, since he was\r\nno doubt as good a man would like to find a place could be.\r\n\r\nDr. Leland informs us that “true women are not public\r\nbrawlers”—otherwise lecturers. The poor, dear man! Did he think a\r\npublic lecturer had to be a brawler? The sainted Mary E. Willard was a\r\npublic lecturer, imagine her a public brawler! She did more good than\r\nand left an Influence superior to that of any man in the nation. Her\r\nname is found upon the scroll of honor, where many a man would like to\r\nfind a place. Mrs. Maud Ballington Booth is a =public speaker=. Let all\r\nmen uncover their heads at the mention of her name.\r\n\r\nDr. Leland says: “Administrative faculties are not hers.”\r\n\r\nWithout a trial how could he know she was so deficient? Man has\r\ndemonstrated his ability in that line; God forbid that woman develops\r\nthe same kind if the opportunity ever occurs.\r\n\r\nPublic plunder and panics, the murder of babies in workshop and\r\nfactory, a Congress, so corrupt that trusts and corporations rule the\r\nland—such is the administration of man. Dr. Leland says the forum is\r\nno place for her silver voice, but the rotten reign of man makes it\r\nthe most appropriate place, for the cesspool will not cleanse itself.\r\nWe are informed further that “woman discusses =not= the course of the\r\nplanets.” What the discussion of the planets has to do with the right\r\nof suffrage is not exactly clear, as I believe there are a few voters\r\nwho are unqualified to discuss the course of the planets. In case\r\nit has a bearing, I would announce that it was a woman who drew the\r\nworld’s prize in competition with the wisest in this line but a short\r\ntime ago. The Doctor said:\r\n\r\n“She guides =no= vessels through the night and tempest across the\r\ntrackless sea.” But she does greater things. She possesses the heart\r\nand heroism to jeopardize her life in rescuing the shipwrecked. We have\r\nmany a Grace Darling, we have many a Florence Nightingale, who have\r\nmanifested greater bravery and brain than required to guide a vessel.\r\nBut this latter charge will not hold today.\r\n\r\nFinally, as a clincher, the Doctor stated that “the strength of\r\nMilton’s poetic vision is far beyond her delicate perception, she would\r\nhave been affrighted at that fiery sea upon whose flaming billows—\r\n\r\n                  ‘Satan, with head above the waves\r\n                   And eyes that sparkling blazed.’”\r\n\r\nWe =again= find the Doctor an =incompetent= judge of woman. A wife who\r\nhas to encounter a drunken husband time after time, and who lives in\r\nterror of her life, is used to blazing eyes and bleared eyes, and all\r\nkinds. She would prefer to meet Satan, any time, for there is no record\r\nof his being a “drunk.”\r\n\r\nWoman asks for the ballot that she may vote this worst of hells out of\r\nher life. Yet we find men who respect her so much they would withhold\r\nthis privilege of defense.\r\n\r\nSuch chivalry is sick and needs medicine.\r\n\r\n                                        (Mrs.) Marion Todd.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nA VICTIM OF MILITARY DISCIPLINE.\r\n\r\nDear Mr. Watson:\r\n\r\nI am requested to write out the details of the execution of a\r\nConfederate soldier at Morton, Mississippi, in July, 1863. I will\r\nendeavor to do so to the best of my recollection; and I think that what\r\nI shall write will be substantially correct, because the incident is\r\nfrescoed upon my memory.\r\n\r\nDuring the siege of Vicksburg, General Joseph E. Johnson was placed in\r\ncommand of the Army in Mississippi which was being organized outside\r\nto relieve General Pemberton. General W. H. T. Walker commanded a\r\ndivision in said Army. His command consisted of the brigares of Guist,\r\nWilson, McNair, Ector and Gregg. I was on the staff of General Gregg.\r\nWe were for some time at Yazoo City preparing to move on the rear of\r\nGeneral Grant, who was then closely besieging Vicksburg. When we got\r\nready and our large supply train prepared (which we expected to take\r\ninto Vicksburg), we marched from Yazoo City towards the Big Black Creek\r\nand encamped some days at a little hamlet called Vernon, a few miles\r\nWest of Canton. While in camp there, one day a regiment of cavalry\r\npassed along the road, by the side of which the 46th Georgia Regiment\r\nwas encamped. This regiment was commanded by Colonel Peyton Colquitt,\r\nwho was afterwards killed at Chickamauga. Some one recognized a man in\r\nthe cavalry who formerly belonged to the 46th Georgia. The soldier had\r\ndeserted from the latter regiment whilst it was on the Georgia coast,\r\nand joined this regiment of cavalry. He was arrested—charges preferred\r\nagainst him for desertion. He was tried by a court martial which was\r\nsitting at Vernon.\r\n\r\nThe man was convicted, but no publication was then made of the results\r\nof the trial, but the findings were regularly forwarded to General\r\nJohnson’s headquarters, and then we broke camp and moved down to the\r\nBig Black for the purpose of crossing to attack General Grant. Indeed,\r\nwe reached the point to cross on the night of July 3rd, and the\r\nengineer corps was preparing to throw the pontoons across, when news\r\ncame that Vicksburg had surrendered. Then we commenced our retrograde\r\nmovement towards Jackson—passing through Clinton, Mississippi, en\r\nroute. Sherman was sent in pursuit and we reached Jackson one day ahead\r\nof him and went into the works which had been prepared for the defense\r\nof Jackson.\r\n\r\nSherman immediately extended his besieging lines with both flanks\r\nresting on Pearl River, forming a semi-circle, leaving the Eastern\r\nside of the city open for our retreat. I think we remained there one\r\nweek before retreating. General Johnson found it impossible to keep\r\nSherman from crossing the river and getting in his rear and, therefore,\r\nevacuated the works and took up his line of march one night towards\r\nMeridian. After we were some distance on the road beyond Brandon, a\r\nterrific rain-storm came on, with heavy thunder and lightning. The\r\nrain was so heavy and the night so dark the troops scarcely march,\r\nencountering here and there wagons and artillery stuck in the mud.\r\n\r\nWe reached Morton about daylight and went into camp. The sun rose in\r\nall its brightness and intensity of July heat. The troops were drying\r\noff and preparing their camp for cooking, etc., when this convicted\r\nsoldier struggled up to the provost guard and said to the Major in\r\ncommand: “Well, Major, I got lost last night but am up as soon as I\r\ncould find you.” The officer turned over to the guard and said: “I am\r\nsorry you came up for orders have been issued that you must be shot\r\ntoday at one o’clock p. m.”\r\n\r\nWhen General Walker learned of this incident, his sympathies were\r\naroused and he and Major Cumming mounted their horses and rode to\r\nGeneral Johnson’s headquarters. General Walker dismounted, recited\r\nthe facts to his superior officer and interceded for the poor fellow.\r\nThe only reply was: “General Walker, my orders must be obeyed.” The\r\nlatter saluted and replied, “General, they shall be,” and mounted his\r\nhorse. With tears in his eyes he instructed Major Cumming to have Major\r\nSchauff (I do not know that I spell this name correctly) make a detail\r\nfor the execution and carry it out at 1 o’clock promptly.\r\n\r\nHe then ordered the division out to witness the execution. The brigade\r\nformed three sides of a square in a large old field flanked by second\r\ngrowth of pines; the grave had been dug in the center of it, his coffin\r\nresting on the further side from the firing squad. The condemned man\r\nasked not to be blindfolded; his hands were tied behind his back,\r\nhe knelt on his coffin, and in the presence of the whole division,\r\nincluding his old 46th Georgia Regiment and his comrades therein, and\r\nwas shot to death, placed in his box, or coffin, and was buried right\r\nthere in that old field.\r\n\r\nThe saddest part of it was that the testimony showed he had been so\r\ngood and gallant soldier in his adopted regiment, and he stated the\r\nonly reason he left the 46th Georgia was that he got tired of inaction\r\ndown on the coast and wanted to be where he could do some fighting. He\r\nalso stated that he had a wife and child at home in Georgia.\r\n\r\nI wish I knew his name and Company, but I do not. Major Cumming may.\r\n\r\nI think these facts are substantially correct, and hope they will be of\r\nsome service to you.\r\n\r\n                                                     M. P. CARROLL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOK REVIEWS]\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Poem Outlines.= By Sidney Lanier. Charles\r\n   Scribner’s Sons, Publishers, New York.\r\n\r\nD’Israeli’s “Calamities and Quarrels of Authors” may be ransacked in\r\nvain for an example of misfortune, suffering and heroic combat with\r\nadversity, more pathetic and more admirable than that of Sidney Lanier.\r\n\r\nThe literary history of our own country presents many an instance of\r\nthe neglected genius, struggling with poverty, but none of them appeals\r\nto us quite so powerfully as does that of the Georgia poet who wrote\r\nthe “Hymn to Sunrise”—wrote it when his hand was too weak to lift food\r\nto his mouth and when his fever temperature was 104.\r\n\r\nBorn in Macon, Ga., in 1842, he had hardly graduated, with the first\r\nhonor, at Oglethorpe College, before the Civil War drew him, a youth of\r\neighteen, into the Macon Volunteers, the first Georgia troops that went\r\nto the front.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war,—in which he had been in several battles and had\r\nspent months in prison—he returned on foot to Georgia.\r\n\r\nAfter a long and desperate illness, he went to Alabama, where he\r\nclerked in a store in Montgomery, and then became a school teacher.\r\n\r\nHe married in 1868 and soon afterwards had the first hemorrhage from\r\nthe lungs.\r\n\r\nReturning to Macon, he studied law and began its practice, with his\r\nfather.\r\n\r\nThe lung trouble was a fixture, however, and he went to New York for\r\ntreatment. The remainder of his life presents the distressing spectacle\r\nof pursuer and pursued—the Disease in chase of the victim. We find\r\nhim now in Texas, then in Florida, now in Pennsylvania, then in North\r\nCarolina,—with his remorseless enemy on his trail, always.\r\n\r\nIn the occasional improvements in his health, in the temporary respites\r\nfrom the implacable foe, was done the literary work which gives Sidney\r\nLanier his place in the hall of fame. A born musician, he played organ,\r\npiano, flute, violin, banjo and guitar, but his preference was the\r\nviolin and his specialty the flute.\r\n\r\nIt was his exquisite music on the flute which secured and held for him\r\nthe leadership of the Peabody Symphony Concerts, in Baltimore. To this\r\ncity he went to live in 1873, and Baltimore was his home during the few\r\nyears that were left to him.\r\n\r\nThere is no record of a braver struggle with poverty and disease than\r\nthat made by the Georgia poet during these last tragical years.\r\n\r\nFugitive writings for the magazines, lecture courses to private\r\nclasses, books in prose and books in verse, first-flute in an\r\norchestra, public lectures at the Peabody Institute, and then the final\r\nscene in North Carolina where the long, hideous battle comes to its\r\npitiful close. (Aug. 1881.)\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that Sidney Lanier ever got much money out of his\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n“Tiger Lilies,” his novel, made no hit; “The Science of English Verse”\r\ncould not possibly appeal to many; and even his volumes of verse had\r\nno considerable recognition during the poet’s life-time. Indeed, it\r\nis doubtful whether Lanier will ever be one of the favorites of all\r\nclasses, like Burns and Byron, Longfellow and Bret Harte.\r\n\r\nIt appears to be the literal fact that the Georgia poet was =always=\r\nhard up. Poverty and Consumption were =always= dogging his steps. To\r\nkeep himself and family from want, he =had= to be first-flute in the\r\nConcert, =had= to deliver those lectures. No matter how weak he was, no\r\nmatter how ill and depressed, he =had= to go,—and he =did= go and go\r\nand go, until he was so far spent that it may be said that his last\r\nlectures were the death-rattle of a dying man. It is said that his\r\nhearers, to whom his condition was but too evident, listened to these\r\nfinal discourses “in a kind of fascinated terror.”\r\n\r\nRead this extract from one of his letters to his wife:\r\n\r\n“So many great ideas for Art are born to me each day, =I am swept away\r\ninto the land of All-Delight by their strenuous sweet whirlwind=; and\r\nI find within myself such entire, yet humble, confidence of possessing\r\nevery single element of power to carry them all out, =save the little\r\npaltry sum of money that would suffice to keep us clothed and fed in\r\nthe meantime=.\r\n\r\n“=I do not understand this=.”\r\n\r\n(The black type is ours.)\r\n\r\nIt reminds one of that letter of Edgar Poe, written to Childers of\r\nGeorgia, requesting a small loan and saying simply, abjectly, “I am so\r\nmiserably poor and friendless.”\r\n\r\nHis poverty cowed Poe, and caused him to do unmanly things. Poverty\r\ndid not cow Sidney Lanier, and never in his life did he do an unmanly\r\nthing. Much of the time he was not able to have his family with him.\r\nTherefore, the battle that was fought by this unfearing soul was a sick\r\nman, a lonely man, a care-worn man, a sensitive man, a very poor man\r\nagainst odds that he knew he could not long resist.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Charles Scribner’s Sons brought out a complete collection of\r\nthe “Poems of Sidney Lanier, edited by his wife.” Of those poems we\r\nhave not space to write.\r\n\r\nThe present volume is unique and to those who value the brief\r\nsuggestion which fires a train of thought, it is valuable,—exceedingly\r\nso.\r\n\r\nNot all of these “Outlines” are properly so called. Many of them are as\r\ncomplete in themselves as are the Cameos of Walter Savage Landor.\r\n\r\nLike other Georgia bards—A. R. Watson, Dr. Frank Tickner, Joel\r\nChandler Harris, Frank L. Stanton and Don Marquis,—Sidney Lanier could\r\nput so much thought and beauty into four lines as to give one a sense\r\nof perfection.\r\n\r\nFor example,\r\n\r\n           “And then\r\n     A gentle violin =mated= with the flute,\r\n    =And both flew off into a wood of harmony,\r\n           Two doves of tone=.”\r\n\r\n=That= is not the “=Outline=” of a poem; it is =a poem=, perfect in its\r\nway and complete in itself. =There was nothing more to be said.=\r\n\r\nAgain,\r\n\r\n    “=Tolerance, like a Harbor=, lay\r\n     Smooth and shining and secure,\r\n    =Where ships carrying every flag\r\n     Of faith were anchored in peace=.”\r\n\r\nThis also,\r\n\r\n    “Who doubts but Eve had a rose in her hair\r\n       Ere fig leaves fettered her limbs?\r\n     So Life wore poetry’s perfect rose\r\n       Before ’twas clothed with economic prose.”\r\n\r\nAnd,\r\n\r\n    “How did’st thou win her, Death?\r\n     Thou art the only rival that ever made her cold to me.”\r\n\r\nAnd,\r\n\r\n    “Wan Silence lying, lip on ground.\r\n    =An outcast Angel from the heaven of sound=,\r\n           Prone and desolate\r\n           By the shut Gate.”\r\n\r\nOne more selection, and we leave off:\r\n\r\n           “Look out Death, I am coming,\r\n   =Art thou not glad?= What talks we’ll have,\r\n            What mem’ries of old battles.\r\n    Come, bring the bowl, Death; I am thirsty.”\r\n\r\nThis is no “Outline”; it is a complete poem, =a terribly complete\r\npoem=. Like the flash in a night of storm, it lights up a world of\r\nraging elements and universal gloom.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =“Pokahuntas, Maid of Jamestown.”=\r\n        By Anne Sanford Green. The Exponent Press, Culpeper, Va.\r\n\r\nIn the Introduction, the author says,\r\n\r\n“We have expended great pains, and much time and thought, to\r\ndemonstrate that the whole story of Pokahuntas and John Smith was\r\nmainly true, and not mythological, and unfit to be told, as some\r\nVirginia historians have been at pains to prove.\r\n\r\n“But really, that it was true that Captain John Smith loved the Indian\r\nmaiden, and that he was the one love of her life.”\r\n\r\nThe author cites the county records of Virginia to substantiate the\r\nfacts upon which her story rests, and uses extensively the work of\r\nAnnas Todkill, “My Lady Pokahuntas,” published in the seventeenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOut of these materials has been evolved a narrative which is deeply\r\ninteresting. How the Indian girl saved Captain Smith’s life, how she\r\ncame to love him, how she saved the colony from starvation, how the\r\nenemies of Captain Smith finally made his position unbearable and how\r\nhe sailed away, after a tender leave-taking of Pokahuntas, how the\r\nungrateful colonists captured the girl and held her as hostage, how the\r\nreport of Captain Smith’s death came to Jamestown and was believed by\r\nall, how the Indian maiden was wooed and won by Rolfe, how she went to\r\nEngland and was the honored guest of royalty, how she saw Captain Smith\r\nat Shakespeare’s theatre, how her love for him revived and filled her\r\nwith despair, how she sickened and died,—such is the outline of this\r\nfascinating story. The author tells it, without the waste of a word,\r\nand with simplicity, directness and force.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =Disastrous Financial Panics=: Cause and Remedy.\r\n       By Jesse Gillmore, San Diego, Cal. Price 25 cents.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, a most love of a book,” wrote some one rapturously of a volume\r\nwhich had pleased him immensely. One is tempted to repeat the phrase\r\nin reference to Mr. Gillmore’s little work, because he has swept\r\nout the ambiguous, the obscure and tiresome, condensed statistical\r\ntables into a few lines and made his subject vitally interesting. The\r\ndifficulty of enlightening a majority of people on the evils of our\r\nfinancial system consists in the refusal of the reader to be bored by\r\ndreary compilations of figures and tedious elaborations. Mr. Gillmore’s\r\nbook is history and logic in so entertaining a form that the reader\r\nis delighted; and even a school boy would find in it nothing dull or\r\nconfusing. The true test of a popular work on an instructive subject\r\nreally is whether or not it is laid down by the reader with a definite:\r\n“Why, I understand that. It was never made so plain to me before.”\r\n\r\nThe small price and the ease with which the pamphlet may be handled\r\nand read should make “Disastrous Financial Panics” a very valuable\r\ncontribution to the cause of reform.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    =The Cure of Consumption, Coughs and Colds.= By\r\n       Fred.

Price $1. Published by\r\n       the Anti-Usury League, Albany, Oregon.\r\n\r\nIt is safe to say that more sincere Christians have been gulled into\r\nsubmission to injustice and oppression by the Scriptural phrase,\r\n“Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar’s,” than by anything else.\r\nTherefore, Mr. Calvin’s careful analysis of the economical situation\r\ncreated by the custom of exacting usury is enormously strengthened by\r\nhis clear conception of the true meaning of Bible sayings. He traces\r\nthe history of interest through both Old and New Testaments down to\r\nthe present time and shows beyond cavil the inquiry of a system which\r\ninsures the perpetual enslavement of a debt-paying class for the\r\nbenefit of a moneyed aristocracy.\r\n\r\nThere can be no freedom so long as usury endures. We may sometimes sigh\r\nfor the power of a king—but what European monarch does not servilely\r\nbow to the will of the house of Rothschild? Until we have corrected\r\nthe ability to extort taxes from generations yet unborn, we may expect\r\nneither liberty, nor justice nor equality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVOLUTION\r\n\r\n\r\nBy LANGDON SMITH\r\n\r\n    When you were a tadpole and I was a fish,\r\n        In the Paleozoic time,\r\n    And side by side on the ebbing tide,\r\n        We sprawled through the ooze and slime,\r\n    Or skittered with many a caudal flip,\r\n        Through the depths of the Cambrian fen,\r\n    My heart was rife with the joy of life,\r\n        For I loved you even then.\r\n\r\n    Mindless we lived and mindless we loved,\r\n        And mindless at last we died;\r\n    And deep in a rift of the Caradoc drift\r\n        We slumbered side by side.\r\n    The world turned on in the lathe of time,\r\n        The hot lands heaved amain,\r\n    Till we caught our breath from the womb of death,\r\n        And crept into light again.\r\n\r\n    We were amphibians, scaled and tailed,\r\n        And drab as a dead man’s hand;\r\n    We coiled at ease ’neath the dripping trees,\r\n        Or trailed through the mud and sand,\r\n    Croaking and blind, with our three-clawed feet\r\n        Writing a language dumb,\r\n    With never a spark in the empty dark\r\n        To hint at a life to come.\r\n\r\n    Yet happy we lived, and happy we loved,\r\n        And happy we died once more;\r\n    Our forms were rolled in the clinging mold\r\n        Of a Neocomian shore.\r\n    The eons came, and the eons fled,\r\n        And the sleep that wrapped us fast\r\n    Was riven away in a newer day,\r\n        And the night of death was past.\r\n\r\n    Then light and swift through the jungle trees\r\n        We swung in our airy flights,\r\n    Or breathed in the balms of the fronded palms,\r\n        In the hush of the moonless nights.\r\n    And oh! what beautiful years were these,\r\n        When our hearts clung each to each;\r\n    When life was filled, and our senses thrilled\r\n        In the first faint dawn of speech.\r\n\r\n    Thus life by life, and love by love,\r\n        We passed through the cycles strange,\r\n    And breath by breath, and death by death,\r\n        We followed the chain of change.\r\n    Till there came a time in the law of life\r\n        When over the nursing sod\r\n    The shadows broke, and the soul awoke\r\n        In a strange, dim dream of God.\r\n\r\n    I was thewed like an Auroch bull,\r\n        And tusked like the great Cave Bear;\r\n    And you, my sweet, from head to feet,\r\n        Were gowned in your glorious hair.\r\n    Deep in the gloom of a fireless cave,\r\n        When the night fell o’er the plain,\r\n    And the moon hung red o’er the river bed,\r\n        We mumbled the bones of the slain.\r\n\r\n    I flaked a flint to a cutting edge,\r\n        And shaped it with brutish craft;\r\n    I broke a shank from the woodland dank.\r\n        And fitted it, head and haft,\r\n    Then I hid me close to the reedy tarn,\r\n        Where the Mammoth came to drink—\r\n    Through brawn and bone I drove the stone,\r\n        And slew him upon the brink.\r\n\r\n    Loud I howled through the moonlit wastes,\r\n        Loud answered our kith and kin;\r\n    From west and east to the crimson feast,\r\n        The clan came trooping in.\r\n    O’er joint and gristle and padded hoof,\r\n        We fought, and clawed and tore,\r\n    And cheek by jowl, with many a growl,\r\n        We talked the marvel o’er.\r\n\r\n    I carved the fight on a reindeer bone,\r\n        With rude and hairy hand,\r\n    I pictured his fall on the cavern wall\r\n        That men might understand.\r\n    For we lived by blood, and the right of might,\r\n        Ere human laws were drawn,\r\n    And the age of sin did not begin\r\n        Till our brutal tusks were gone.\r\n\r\n    And that was a million years ago,\r\n        In a time that no man knows;\r\n    Yet here tonight in the mellow light,\r\n        We sit at Delmonico’s;\r\n    Your eyes are deep as the Devon springs,\r\n        Your hair is dark as jet;\r\n    Your years are few, your life is new,\r\n        Your soul untried, and yet—\r\n\r\n    Our trail is on the Kimmeridge clay,\r\n        And the scarp of the Purbeck flags,\r\n    We have left our bones in the Bagshot stones,\r\n        And deep in the Coraline crags;\r\n    Our love is old, our lives are old,\r\n        And death shall come amain;\r\n    Should it come today, what man may say,\r\n        We shall not live again?\r\n\r\n    God wrought our souls from the Tremadoc beds\r\n        And furnished them wings to fly;\r\n    He sowed our spawn in the world’s dim dawn,\r\n        And I know that it shall not die.\r\n    Though cities have sprung above the graves\r\n        Where the crook-boned men made war,\r\n    And the ox-wain creaks o’er the buried caves,\r\n        Where the mummied mammoths are.\r\n\r\n    Then as we linger at luncheon here,\r\n        O’er many a dainty dish,\r\n    Let us drink anew to the time when you\r\n        Were a tadpole and I was a fish.\r\n\r\nED.
