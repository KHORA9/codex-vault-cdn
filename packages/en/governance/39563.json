For nearly two years\r\npreceding the overthrow of the monarchy, Americans, like the people of\r\nall other countries opposing Germany, were dependent for their direct\r\ninformation upon the reports of neutral correspondents, and a stringent\r\ncensorship prevented these from reporting anything of value regarding\r\nthe conditions that were throughout this period gradually making the\r\nGerman Empire ripe for its fall. To a great extent, indeed, not only\r\nthese foreign journalists, but the great mass of the Germans themselves,\r\nhad little knowledge of the manner in which the Empire was being\r\nundermined.\r\n\r\nDuring the crucial days of the revolution, up to the complete overthrow\r\nof the central government at Berlin, a sharpened censorship prevented\r\nany valuable direct news from being sent out, and the progress of events\r\nwas told to the outside world mainly by travelers, excited soldiers on\r\nthe Danish frontier and two or three-day-old German newspapers whose\r\neditors were themselves not only handicapped by the censorship, but also\r\nignorant of much that had happened and unable to present a clear picture\r\nof events as a whole. When the bars were finally thrown down to enemy\r\ncorrespondents, the exigencies of daily newspaper work required them to\r\ndevote their undivided attention to the events that were then occurring.\r\nHence the developments preceding and attending the revolution could not\r\nreceive that careful consideration and portrayal which is necessary if\r\nthey are to be properly understood.\r\n\r\nAn attempt is made in this book to make clear the factors and events\r\nthat made the revolution possible, and to give a broad outline of its\r\nsecond phase, from the middle of November, 1918, to the ratification by\r\nGermany of the Peace of Versailles. A preliminary description of\r\nGermany's governmental structure, although it may contain nothing new to\r\nreaders who know Germany well, could not be omitted. It is requisite for\r\na comprehension of the strength of the forces and events that finally\r\noverthrew the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nMuch of the history told deals with matters of which the author has\r\npersonal knowledge. He had been for several years before the war\r\nresident in Berlin as an Associated Press correspondent. He was in\r\nVienna when the Dual Monarchy declared war on Serbia, and in Berlin\r\nduring mobilization and the declarations of war on Russia and France. He\r\nwas with the German armies on all fronts during the first two years of\r\nthe war as correspondent, and was in Berlin two weeks before America\r\nsevered diplomatic relations with Germany. The author spent the summer\r\nof 1917 in Russia, and watched the progress of affairs in Germany from\r\nStockholm and Copenhagen during the winter of 1917-18. He spent the\r\nthree months preceding the German Revolution in Copenhagen, in daily\r\ntouch with many proved sources of information, and was the first enemy\r\ncorrespondent to enter Germany after the armistice, going to Berlin on\r\nNovember 18, 1918. He attended the opening sessions of the National\r\nAssembly at Weimar in February, 1919, and remained in Germany until the\r\nend of March, witnessing both the first and second attempts of the\r\nSpartacans to overthrow the Ebert-Haase government.\r\n\r\nThe author's aim in writing this book has been to give a truthful and\r\nadequate picture of the matters treated, without any \"tendency\"\r\nwhatever. It is not pretended that the book exhausts the subject. Many\r\nmatters which might be of interest, but which would hinder the\r\nstraightforward narration of essentials, have been omitted, but it is\r\nbelieved that nothing essential to a comprehension of the world's\r\ngreatest political event has been left out.\r\n\r\nA word in conclusion regarding terminology.\r\n\r\n_Proletariat_ does not mean, as is popularly supposed in America, merely\r\nthe lowest grade of manual laborers. It includes all persons whose work\r\nis \"exploited\" by others, i. e., who depend for their existence upon\r\nwages or salaries. Thus actors, journalists, clerks, stenographers,\r\netc., are reckoned as proletarians.\r\n\r\nThe _bourgeoisie_ includes all persons who live from the income of\r\ninvestments or from businesses or properties (including real estate)\r\nowned by them. In practice, however, owners of small one-man or\r\none-family businesses, although belonging to what the French term the\r\n_petite bourgeoisie_, are regarded as proletarians. The nobility,\r\nformerly a class by itself, is now _de facto_ included under the name\r\n_bourgeoisie_, despite the contradiction of terms thus involved.\r\n\r\nNo effort has been made toward consistency in the spelling of German\r\nnames. Where the German form might not be generally understood, the\r\nEnglish form has been used. In the main, however, the German forms have\r\nbeen retained.\r\n\r\nSocialism and Social-Democracy, Socialist and Social-Democrat, have been\r\nused interchangeably throughout. There is no difference of meaning\r\nbetween the words.\r\n\r\n                                                     S. MILES BOUTON\r\n\r\nAsheville, New York,\r\n  November 1, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n                 The Governmental Structure of Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe peoples of this generation--at least, those of highly civilized and\r\ncultured communities--had little or no familiarity with revolutions and\r\nthe history of revolutions before March, 1917, when Tsar Nicholas II was\r\noverthrown. There was and still is something about the very word\r\n\"revolution\" which is repugnant to all who love ordered and orderly\r\ngovernment. It conjures up pictures of rude violence, of murder, pillage\r\nand wanton destruction. It violates the sentiments of those that respect\r\nthe law, for it is by its very nature a negation of the force of\r\nexisting laws. It breaks with traditions and is an overcoming of\r\ninertia; and inertia rules powerfully the majority of all peoples.\r\n\r\nThe average American is comparatively little versed in the history of\r\nother countries. He knows that the United States of America came into\r\nexistence by a revolution, but \"revolutionary\" is for him in this\r\nconnection merely an adjective of time used to locate and describe a war\r\nfought between two powers toward the end of the eighteenth century. He\r\ndoes not realize, or realizes but dimly, the essential kinship of all\r\nrevolutions. Nor does he realize that most of the governments existing\r\ntoday came into being as the result of revolutions, some of them\r\nbloodless, it is true, but all at bottom a revolt against existing laws\r\nand governmental forms. The extortion of the Magna Charta from King John\r\nin 1215 was not the less a revolution because it was the bloodless work\r\nof the English barons. It took two bloody revolutions to establish\r\nFrance as a republic. All the Balkan states are the products of\r\nrevolution. A man need not be old to remember the overthrow of the\r\nmonarchy in Brazil; the revolution in Portugal was but yesterday as\r\nhistorians count time. Only the great wisdom and humanitarianism of the\r\naged King Oscar II prevented fighting and bloodshed between Sweden and\r\nNorway when Norway announced her intention of breaking away from the\r\ndual kingdom. The list could be extended indefinitely.\r\n\r\nThe failure to recall or realize these things was one of the factors\r\nresponsible for the universal surprise and amazement when the\r\nHohenzollerns were overthrown. The other factor was the general--and\r\njustified--impression that the government of Germany was one of the\r\nstrongest, most ably administered and most homogeneous governments of\r\nthe world. And yet Germany, too, or what subsequently became the nucleus\r\nof Germany, had known revolution. It was but seventy years since the\r\nKing of Prussia had been forced to stand bareheaded in the presence of\r\nthe bodies of the \"March patriots,\" who had given their lives in a\r\nrevolt which resulted in a new constitution and far-reaching concessions\r\nto the people.\r\n\r\nEven to those who did recall and realize these things, however, the\r\nGerman revolution came as a shock. The closest observers, men who knew\r\nGermany intimately, doubted to the very last the possibility of\r\nsuccessful revolution there. And yet, viewed in the light of subsequent\r\nhappenings, it will be seen how natural, even unavoidable, the\r\nrevolution was. It came as the inevitable result of conditions created\r\nby the war and the blockade. It will be the purpose of this book to make\r\nclear the inevitableness of the _debacle_, and to explain the events\r\nthat followed it.\r\n\r\nFor a better understanding of the whole subject a brief explanation of\r\nthe structure of Germany's governmental system is in place. This will\r\nserve the double purpose of showing the strength of the system which the\r\nrevolution was able to overturn and of dispelling a too general\r\nignorance regarding it.\r\n\r\nThe general condemnation of Prussia, the Prussians and the Hohenzollerns\r\nmust not be permitted to obscure their merits and deserts. For more than\r\nfive hundred years without a break in the male line this dynasty handed\r\ndown its inherited rights and produced an array of great administrators\r\nwho, within three centuries, raised Prussia to the rank of a first-rate\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom that subsequently became the nucleus for the German Empire\r\nlost fully half its territory by the Peace of Tilsit in 1807, when,\r\nfollowing the reverses in the Napoleonic wars, Germany was formally\r\ndissolved and the Confederation of the Rhine was formed by Napoleon. The\r\nstanding army was limited to 42,000 men, and trade with Great Britain\r\nwas prohibited. The Confederation obeyed the letter of the military\r\nterms, but evaded its spirit by successively training levies of 42,000\r\nmen, and within six years enough trained troops were available to make a\r\nrevolt against Napoleonic slavery possible. The French were routed and\r\ncut to pieces at the Battle of the Nations near Leipsic in 1813, and\r\nPrussian Germany was again launched on the road to greatness.\r\n\r\nA certain democratic awakening came on the heels of the people's\r\nliberation from foreign domination. It manifested itself particularly in\r\nthe universities. The movement became so threatening that a conference\r\nof ministers of the various states was convoked in 1819 to consider\r\ncounter-measures. The result was an order disbanding the political\r\nunions of the universities, placing the universities under police\r\nsupervision and imposing a censorship upon their activities.\r\n\r\nThe movement was checked, but not stopped. In 1847 ominous signs of a\r\npopular revolution moved King Frederick William IV of Prussia to summon\r\nthe Diet to consider governmental reforms. The chief demand presented by\r\nthis Diet was for a popular representation in the government. The King\r\nrefused to grant this. A striking commentary upon the political\r\nbackwardness of Germany is furnished by the fact that one of the demands\r\nmade by a popular convention held in Mannheim in the following year was\r\nfor trial by jury, a right granted in England more than six hundred\r\nyears earlier by the Magna Charta. Other demands were for the freedom of\r\nthe press and popular representation in the government.\r\n\r\nThe revolution of 1848 in Prussia, while it failed to produce all that\r\nhad been hoped for by those responsible for it, nevertheless resulted in\r\nwhat were for those times far-reaching reforms. A diet was convoked at\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main. It adopted a constitution establishing some\r\ndecided democratic reforms and knit the fabric of the German\r\nconfederation more closely together.\r\n\r\nThe structure of the Confederation was already very substantial, despite\r\nmuch state particularism and internal friction. An important event in\r\nthe direction of a united Germany had been the establishment in 1833 of\r\nthe _Zollverein_ or Customs Union. The existence of scores of small\r\nstates,[1] each with its own tariffs, currency and posts, had long\r\nhindered economic development. There is a well-known anecdote regarding\r\na traveler who, believing himself near the end of his day's journey,\r\nafter having passed a dozen customs-frontiers, found his way barred by\r\nthe customs-officials of another tiny principality. Angered at the\r\nunexpected delay, he refused to submit to another examination of his\r\neffects and another exaction of customs-duties.\r\n\r\n[1] There were more than three hundred territorial sovereignties\r\n    in Germany when the new constitution of the union was adopted\r\n    at the Congress of Vienna in 1815.--There were principalities\r\n    of less than one square mile in extent. The particularism\r\n    engendered by this state of affairs has always been one of\r\n    the greatest handicaps with which federal government in\r\n    Germany has had to contend.\r\n\r\n\"You aren't a country,\" he said. \"You're just a spot. I'll go around\r\nyou.\" And this he did, without being seriously delayed in reaching his\r\ndestination.\r\n\r\nThe growing power of Germany aroused the fear of the French, who\r\nrealized what the union of the vital, energetic and industrious German\r\nraces would mean. Years of tension culminated in the war of 1870-71. The\r\nresult is known. Unprepared for the conflict, the French were crushed,\r\njust as Austria had been crushed four years earlier.\r\n\r\nThe last external obstacle in the way of German unity and strength had\r\nthus strangely been removed. On January 18, 1871, while the victorious\r\nGerman armies still stood at the gates of Paris, King William I was\r\nproclaimed German Emperor as Kaiser Wilhelm I.\r\n\r\nThe designation as \"German Emperor\" should be noted, because it is\r\nsignificant of the manner of union of the German Empire. The aged\r\nmonarch was insistent that the title should be \"Emperor of Germany.\" To\r\nthis the sovereigns of the other German states objected, as carrying the\r\nimplication of their own subjection. Between \"German Emperor\" or\r\n\"Emperor in Germany\" and \"Emperor of Germany,\" they pointed out, there\r\nwas a wide difference. \"German Emperor\" implied merely that the holder\r\nof that title was _primus inter pares_, merely the first among equals,\r\nthe presiding officer of an aggregation of sovereigns of equal rank who\r\nhad conferred this dignity upon him, just as a diet, by electing one of\r\nits number chairman, confers upon him no superiority of rank, but merely\r\ndesignates him to conduct their deliberations. These sovereigns'\r\njealousy of their own prerogatives had at first led them to consider\r\nvesting the imperial honors alternately with the Prussian and Bavarian\r\nKing, but this idea was abandoned as impracticable. At the urgent\r\nrepresentations of Bismarck the aged King consented, with tears in his\r\neyes, it is said, to accept the designation of German Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe German Empire as thus formed consisted of twenty-five states and the\r\n_Reichsland_ of Alsace-Lorraine, which was administered by a viceroy\r\nappointed by the King of Prussia. The empire was a federated union of\r\nstates much on the pattern of the United States of America, but the\r\nfederative character was not completely carried out because of the\r\nparticularism of certain states. The Bavarians, whose customs of life,\r\neasy-going ways, and even dialects are more akin to those of the German\r\nAustrians than of the Prussians,[2] exacted far-reaching concessions as\r\nthe price of their entrance into the empire. They retained their own\r\ndomestic tariff-imposts, their own army establishment, currency,\r\nrailways, posts, telegraphs and other things. Certain other states also\r\nreserved a number of rights which ought, for the formation of a perfect\r\nfederative union, to have been conferred upon the central authority. On\r\nthe whole, however, these reservations proved less of a handicap than\r\nmight have been expected.\r\n\r\n[2] The Bavarians have from early days disliked the Prussians\r\n    heartily. _Saupreuss'_ (sow-Prussian) and other even less\r\n    elegant epithets were in common use against the natives of\r\n    the dominant state. It must in fairness be admitted that this\r\n    dislike was the natural feeling of the less efficient\r\n    Bavarian against the efficient and energetic Prussian.\r\n\r\nThe Imperial German Constitution adopted at this time was in many ways a\r\nremarkable document. It cleverly combined democratic and absolutist\r\nfeatures. The democratic features were worked out with a wonderful\r\npsychological instinct. In the hands of almost any people except the\r\nGermans or Slavs the democratic side of this instrument would have\r\neventually become the predominant one. That it did not is a tribute to\r\nthe astuteness of Bismarck and of the men who, under his influence,\r\ndrafted the constitution.\r\n\r\nThe German Parliament or _Reichsrat_ was composed of two houses, the\r\n_Bundesrat_, or Federal Council, and the _Reichstag_, or Imperial Diet.\r\nThe Federal Council was designed as the anchor of absolutism. It was\r\ncomposed of fifty-eight members, of whom seventeen came from Prussia,\r\nsix from Bavaria, and four each from Saxony and Wuerttemberg. The larger\r\nof the other states had two or three each, and seventeen states had but\r\none each. In 1911 three members were granted to Alsace-Lorraine by a\r\nconstitution given at that time to the _Reichsland_. The members of the\r\nFederal Council were the direct representatives of their respective\r\nsovereigns, by whom they were designated, and not of the people of the\r\nrespective states. Naturally they took their instructions from their\r\nsovereigns. Nearly all legislative measures except bills for raising\r\nrevenue had to originate in the Federal Council, and its concurrence\r\nwith the Reichstag was requisite for the enactment of laws. A further\r\nabsolutist feature of the constitution was the provision that fourteen\r\nvotes could block an amendment to the constitution. In other words,\r\nPrussia with her seventeen members could prevent any change not desired\r\nby her governing class.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag, the second chamber of the parliament, was a truly\r\ndemocratic institution. Let us say rather that it could have become a\r\ndemocratic institution. Why it did not do so will be discussed later. It\r\nconsisted of 397 members, who were elected by the most unlimited\r\nsuffrage prevailing at that time in all Europe. It is but recently,\r\nindeed within the last five years, that as universal and free a suffrage\r\nhas been adopted by other European countries, and there are still many\r\nwhich impose limitations unknown to the German Constitution. Every male\r\nsubject who had attained the age of twenty-five years and who had not\r\nlost his civil rights through the commission of crime, or who was not a\r\ndelinquent taxpayer or in receipt of aid from the state or his community\r\nas a pauper, was entitled to vote. The vote was secret and direct, and\r\nthe members of the Reichstag were responsible only to their constituents\r\nand not subject to instructions from any governmental body or person.\r\nThey were elected for a term of three years,[3] but their mandates could\r\nbe terminated at any time by the Kaiser, to whom was reserved the right\r\nto dissolve the Reichstag. If he dissolved it, however, he was compelled\r\nto order another election within a definitely stated period.\r\n\r\n[3] This was later altered to five years.\r\n\r\nOne very real power was vested in the Reichstag. It had full control of\r\nthe empire's purse strings. Bills for raising revenue and all measures\r\nmaking appropriations had to originate in this chamber, and its assent\r\nwas required to their enactment. The reason for its failure to exercise\r\nthis control resolutely must be sought in the history of the German\r\npeople, in their inertia where active participation in governmental\r\nmatters is concerned, and in those psychological characteristics which\r\nBismarck so well comprehended and upon which he so confidently counted.\r\n\r\nNo people on earth had had a more terrible or continuous struggle for\r\nexistence than the various tribes that later amalgamated to form the\r\nnucleus for the German Empire. Their history is a record of almost\r\ncontinuous warfare, going back to the days of Julius Caesar. In the first\r\nyears of the Christian era the Germans under Arminius (Hermann) crushed\r\nthe Romans of Varus's legions in the Teutoburg Forest, and the land was\r\nracked by war up to most modern times. Most of its able-bodied men were\r\nexterminated during the Thirty Years War (1618-1648).[4] This almost\r\nconstant preoccupation in war had a twofold result: it intensified the\r\nstruggle for existence of the common man and kept him from devoting\r\neither his thoughts or energies to problems of government, and it\r\nstrengthened the powers of a comparatively small ruling-class, who alone\r\npossessed any culture and education and whose efforts were naturally\r\ndirected to keeping their serfs in the subjection of ignorance. These\r\nconditions prevailed until well into the last century.\r\n\r\n[4] The population of Germany dropped from twenty to less than\r\n    seven millions during this war.\r\n\r\nThe conditions can best be appreciated by a comparison with the\r\nconditions existing in England at the same time. England, too, had had\r\nher wars, but her soil was but rarely ravaged by foreign invaders, and\r\nnever to the extent in which Germany repeatedly suffered. Parliamentary\r\ngovernment of a sort had existed more than three centuries in England\r\nbefore it reached Germany. A milder climate than that of North Germany\r\nmade the struggle for the bare necessaries of life less strenuous, and\r\ngave opportunity to a greater proportion of the people to consider other\r\nthings than the mere securing of enough to eat and drink. They began to\r\nthink politically centuries before political affairs ceased to rest\r\nentirely in the hands of the nobility of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Germans of the lower and middle classes--in other words, the vast\r\nmajority of the whole people--were thus both without political training\r\nand without even the inclination to think independently along political\r\nlines. Some advance had, it is true, been made along these lines since\r\nthe Napoleonic wars, but the events of 1871 nevertheless found the great\r\nmass of the people without political tutelage or experience. People even\r\nmore politically inclined would have found themselves handicapped by\r\nthis lack of training, and the German--particularly the Southern\r\nGerman--is not politically inclined. This will be discussed more fully\r\nin the chapters dealing with the course of events following the\r\nrevolution of 1918. It will be sufficient to point out here the German's\r\ninclination to abstract reasoning, to philosophizing and to a certain\r\nmysticism; his love of music and fine arts generally, his undeniable\r\ndevotion to the grosser creature-comforts, eating and drinking, and his\r\ntendency not to worry greatly about governmental or other impersonal\r\naffairs provided he be kept well fed and amused. It is, in brief, the\r\nspirit to which the Roman emperors catered with the _panem et\r\ncircenses_, and which manifests itself strikingly in the German\r\ncharacter. The result of all this was a marked inertia which\r\ncharacterized German political life up to recent years. Even when a\r\nlimited political awakening came it was chiefly the work of German-Jews,\r\nnot of Germans of the old stock.\r\n\r\nThese, then, were the conditions that prevented the democratic features\r\nof the Imperial Constitution from acquiring that prominence and\r\nimportance which they would have acquired among a different people. The\r\nKaiser could dissolve the Reichstag at will. Why, then, bother oneself\r\nabout opposing the things desired by the Kaiser and his brother princes?\r\nIt merely meant going to the trouble of a new election, and if that\r\nReichstag should prove recalcitrant also, it could in its turn be\r\ndissolved. Apparently it never occurred to the mass of the Germans that\r\nthe Kaiser could not go on indefinitely dissolving a representative body\r\nwhich insisted upon carrying out the people's will. The Reichstag, being\r\non the whole neither much wiser nor more determined than the people that\r\nelected it, accepted this view of the situation. Occasionally it showed\r\na bit of spirit, notably when it adopted a vote of censure against the\r\ngovernment in the matter of the Zabern affair in 1913. On the whole,\r\nhowever, it accepted meekly the role that caused it to be termed, and\r\njustly, a \"debating club.\" And this was precisely the role that had been\r\nplanned for it by the drafters of the constitution.\r\n\r\nIn justice to the Reichstag, however, one thing should be pointed out.\r\nWhen the German Empire was formed the country was still predominantly an\r\nagricultural land. The election districts were on the whole justly\r\nerected, and no one section of the country had a markedly\r\ndisproportionate number of representatives. It was not long, however,\r\nbefore the flight to the cities began in Germany as in other countries,\r\nand at the beginning of the present century the greater part of\r\nGermany's population lived in the cities. The result was speedily seen\r\nin the constitution of the Reichstag, since no redistricting was ever\r\nmade since the original districting of 1871. Greater Berlin, with a\r\npopulation around four million, elected but six representatives to the\r\nReichstag. In other words, there were some 660,000 inhabitants for every\r\ndelegate. The agricultural districts, however, and especially those of\r\nNorthern Germany--East Elbia, as it is termed--continued to elect the\r\nsame number of representatives as at the beginning to represent a\r\npopulation which had increased but little or not at all. There were\r\ndistricts in East and West Prussia, Brandenburg, Mecklenburg, Pomerania\r\nand Posen where fewer than ten thousand voters were able to send a\r\nrepresentative to the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe result was the natural one. Throughout the world conservatism has\r\nits headquarters on the farms. The farmers cling longest to the old\r\norder of things, they free themselves the most slowly from tradition,\r\nthey are least susceptible to sociological and socialistic ideas and, in\r\nso far as they own their own land, they are among the strongest\r\nsupporters of vested property-rights. In no other country was this more\r\nthe case than in Germany, and especially in the districts mentioned,\r\nwhere large estates predominate and whence have come for two hundred\r\nyears the most energetic, faithful and blindly loyal servants of their\r\nsovereign. The cities, on the other hand, and particularly the larger\r\ncities are the strongholds of new ideas. They are in particular the\r\nbreeding-places of Socialism and Communism. Five of the six Reichstag\r\nmembers elected from Greater Berlin in 1912 were Social-Democrats, and\r\nthe sixth was a Progressive with advanced democratic ideas.\r\n\r\nWith the shifting population and the consequent distortion of the\r\nelection districts, a tremendous advantage accrued to the rural\r\ncommunities; in other words, the forces opposed to democratic reforms\r\nand in favor of maintaining and even increasing the powers of the King\r\nand Emperor steadily increased proportionately their representation in\r\nthe Reichstag at the expense of the friends of democracy. At the\r\nReichstag election of 1912 the Socialists cast roundly thirty-five per\r\ncent of the total popular vote. Handicapped by the unjust districting,\r\nhowever, they were able to elect only 110 delegates, whereas their\r\nproportion of the total vote entitled them to 139. The Progressives,\r\nmost of whose strength also lay in the cities, likewise received fewer\r\nmembers than their total vote entitled them to have. Under a fair\r\ndistricting these two parties would together have had nearly a clear\r\nmajority of the Reichstag. There is reason to believe that the whole\r\ncourse of history of the last years would have been altered had Germany\r\nhonestly reformed her Reichstag election districts ten years ago. On\r\nsuch small things does the fate of nations often rest.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser, as the president of the empire, was authorized to \"represent\r\nthe empire internationally.\" He named the diplomatic representatives to\r\nforeign courts and countries and to the Vatican. He was empowered to\r\nmake treaties, and to declare defensive warfare provided the enemy had\r\nactually invaded German territory. He could not declare an offensive war\r\nwithout the consent of the Federal Council, nor a defensive war unless\r\nthe invasion mentioned had taken place. He was commander-in-chief of the\r\nnavy, and of the Prussian army and the armies of the other federal\r\nstates except of Saxony and Bavaria, which maintained their own military\r\nestablishments. He appointed--in theory--all federal officials and\r\nofficers of the army and navy. On the whole, however, his powers as\r\nGerman Emperor were strictly limited and hardly went beyond the powers\r\nof the ruler of any constitutional monarchy.\r\n\r\nIt was as King of Prussia, however, that he really exercised the\r\ngreatest power, and thus vicariously strengthened his powers in the\r\nempire at large. The parliamentary system of Prussia was archaic and\r\ndesigned to make impossible any really democratic government or a too\r\nsevere limitation upon the powers of the King. It was, like the Imperial\r\nParliament, made up of two chambers, a House of Lords and a Diet. The\r\nupper chamber, the House of Lords, was composed of men appointed by the\r\nKing, either for a fixed term or for life. It goes without saying that\r\nall these men were strong supporters of the monarchic system and\r\noutspoken enemies of democracy. No legislation could be enacted against\r\ntheir will. The composition of the Diet, moreover, was such that the\r\nHouse of Lords had until very recent years little to fear in the way of\r\ndemocratic legislation. It was elected by the so-called three-class\r\nsystem, under which a wealthy man frequently had greater voting power\r\nthan his five hundred employees together. The ballot moreover was\r\nindirect, the delegates being elected by a complicated system of\r\nelectors. In addition to all this, the ballot was open, not secret. This\r\nplaced a powerful weapon in the hands of the employing classes generally\r\nand of the great estate-owners particularly. The polling-places in rural\r\ndistricts were generally located on land belonging to one of these\r\nestates, and the election officials were either the estate-owners\r\nthemselves or men dependent on them. In these circumstances it took a\r\nbrave man to vote otherwise than his employer desired, and there was no\r\nway of concealing for whom or what party he had voted. Bismarck himself,\r\nreactionary and conservative as he was, once termed the Prussian\r\nthree-class voting-system \"the most iniquitous of all franchise\r\nsystems.\"\r\n\r\nAround this a fight had waged for several years before the revolution.\r\nThe Kaiser, as King of Prussia, flatly promised, in his address from the\r\nthrone in 1908, that the system should be reformed. It is a matter of\r\nsimple justice to record that he made the promise in good faith and\r\ntried to see that it was kept. His efforts along this line were thwarted\r\nby a small clique of men who were determined \"to protect the King\r\nagainst himself,\" and who, lacking even the modicum of political\r\nprescience possessed by the Kaiser-King, failed to see that if they did\r\nnot make a concession willingly they would eventually be forced to make\r\na concession of much greater extent. From year to year measures to\r\nreform the three-class system were introduced, only to be killed by the\r\nHouse of Lords. Under the stress of the closing days of the war such a\r\nmeasure was perfected and would have become a law had not the revolution\r\nintervened. But it came too late, just as did scores of other reforms\r\nundertaken in the eleventh hour.\r\n\r\nAnd thus, while the Kaiser's power as German Emperor was sharply\r\nlimited, he enjoyed powers as King of Prussia which in some degree\r\napproached absolutism. The dominance of Prussia in the empire, while it\r\ncould not transfer these powers to the Emperor _de jure_, did\r\nunquestionably effect to some degree a _de facto_ transfer, which, while\r\nit did not in the long run have a very actual or injurious internal\r\neffect, nevertheless played a no inconsiderable part in the outside\r\nworld and was responsible for a general feeling that Germany was in\r\neffect an absolute monarchy. German apologists have maintained that\r\nWilhelm II had less actual power as German Emperor than that possessed\r\nby the President of the United States. This statement is undoubtedly\r\ntrue, but with an important limitation and qualification. The\r\nPresident's great powers are transitory and cannot--or in practice do\r\nnot--extend more than eight years at the most. His exercise of those\r\npowers is governed and restrained during the first four years by his\r\ndesire to be re-elected; during the second four years he must also use\r\nhis powers in such a way that a democratic people will not revenge\r\nitself at the next election upon the President's party. But the Kaiser\r\nand King was subject to no such limitation. He ruled for life, and a\r\ndissatisfied people could not take the succession away from the\r\nHohenzollerns except by revolution. And nobody expected or talked of\r\nrevolution. The only real control over abuses of power rested with a\r\nReichstag which, as has already been explained, was too faithful a\r\nreflex of a non-political and inert constituency to make this control of\r\nmore than mild academic interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n                  The German Conception of the State.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how the whole manner of life and the traditions of the\r\nGermans were obstacles to their political development. Mention has also\r\nbeen made of their peculiar tendency toward abstract philosophic habits\r\nof thought, which are not only inexplicable by the manner of the\r\npeople's long-continued struggle for existence, but seem indeed to\r\nprevail in defiance of it.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this powerful factor there existed another set of factors\r\nwhich worked with wonderful effectiveness toward the same end--the\r\ncrippling of independent and practical political thinking. This was the\r\nconception of the state held by the ruling-classes of Germany and their\r\nmanner of imposing this conception upon the people. It may briefly be\r\nput thus: the people existed for the sake of the state, not the state\r\nfor the sake of the people. The state was the central and great idea;\r\nwhatever weakened its authority or power was of evil. It could grant\r\nfree play to individualism only in those things that could not affect\r\nthe state directly, such as music and the fine arts, and to abstract\r\nphilosophy and literature--particularly the drama--as long as they\r\navoided dangerous political topics. Its keynote was authority and the\r\nsubjection of the individual to the welfare of the state.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of this system to make for efficiency so far as the actual\r\nbrute power of a state is concerned cannot be denied in the light of the\r\nevents of the World War. We have seen how in America itself, the\r\nstronghold of political and religious liberty, individualism was sternly\r\nrepressed and even slight offenses against the authority of the state\r\nwere punished by prison sentences of a barbarous severity unknown in any\r\ncivilized country of Europe. We have seen the churches, reinterpreting\r\nthe principles of the New Testament, and the schools, rewriting history\r\nto supposed good ends, both enlisted in this repression of individualism\r\nfor the sake of increasing the efficiency of the state at a time when\r\nthe highest efficiency was required.\r\n\r\nBut the distinction between such conditions here and the pre-war\r\nconditions in Germany is that they obtained, although in milder form, in\r\nGermany in peace times as well. And the Anglo-Saxon conception of the\r\nstate is as of a thing existing for the sake of the people and with no\r\npossible interests that cannot be served by the democratic and\r\nindividualistic development of its people. Between this conception and\r\nthe conception held by Germany's rulers there is a wide and\r\nirreconcilable difference.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from any consideration of the merits of the German\r\nsystem, it must be admitted that the world has never seen another such\r\nintelligent application of principles of statecraft to the end sought to\r\nbe attained. That the system eventually collapsed was not due to its\r\ninternal faults, but to abnormal and unforeseeable events. The extent of\r\nits collapse, however, was directly due to the structure of the system\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that authority was the keynote of the\r\nGerman system. This authority, embodied in school and church, began to\r\nmold the plastic mind of the German child as early as the age of six.\r\n\"The Emperor is the father of his country and loves his children like a\r\nfather; we owe him the obedience due to a father,\" taught the school.\r\n\"Submit yourselves unto authority,\" said the church, using Paul's words\r\nto serve the ends of the state. The child came from school and church to\r\nhis military service and found authority enthroned there. He had to obey\r\nthe orders of every _Vorgesetzter_ (superior in authority) from field\r\nmarshal down to corporal. He found that, in the absence of officers or\r\nnon-commissioned officers, he must submit himself to the authority of\r\nthe _Stubenaeltester_, the senior soldier in the same room with him.\r\nInsubordination was punished rigorously.\r\n\r\nPrecept, example and punishment were but a part of a system calculated\r\nto make discipline and submission to authority advisable and profitable.\r\nThe penalties prescribed by the German penal and military codes for\r\ninfractions of the laws were far less severe than the penalties\r\nprescribed in the code of any American state, but conviction was\r\nfollowed by a consequence of great moment in Germany: the man who was\r\n_vorbestraft_, that is, who had been punished for any transgression,\r\nfound himself automatically excluded from any opportunity to become a\r\n_Beamter_, or government official.\r\n\r\nThe system of punishment had always as its chief purpose the laying of\r\nemphasis upon duty, and this was often arrived at in an indirect way.\r\nFor example, the soldier who failed to keep his valuables in the locker\r\nprovided for him in his barracks and who lost them by theft, was\r\npunished for his own negligence.\r\n\r\nNo other country in the world employed so large a proportion of its\r\ntotal population in the administration of government, and in no other\r\ncountry was the system so cleverly calculated to make government office\r\nattractive to the average man. The salaries were not larger than those\r\nearned by men of the same class in non-official employments, but\r\nemployment under the government offered in addition both material and\r\nmoral advantages. The chief material advantage was the right to retire\r\nafter a specified number of years of service on liberal pension. The\r\nmoral advantages rested in the dignity of government service and in the\r\nspecial protection afforded government servants. A carefully graded\r\nscale of titles made its appeal to personal vanity. This has frequently\r\nbeen described as particularly German, but it was, in the last analysis,\r\nmerely human. There are comparatively few men in any country, not\r\nexcluding America, who are totally indifferent to titles, and there is\r\nat least one state whose fondness for them has become a stock subject\r\nfor all American humorists. What was, however, particularly German was\r\nthe astuteness with which the ruling-classes of Germany had turned this\r\nhuman weakness to account as an asset of government, and also the extent\r\nto which it had been developed, especially downward. Mr. Smith, who\r\ncleans the streets of an American city, would not be especially\r\ngratified to be addressed as Mr. Street-Cleaner, but his German\r\ncolleague felt a glow of pride at hearing the address \"Herr\r\nStreet-Cleaner Schmidt,\" and this feeling was a very real asset to his\r\ngovernment. It was the same at the other end of the scale. The\r\ngovernment councillor was the more faithful and energetic in his\r\ndevotion to the government's work because he knew that by faithfulness\r\nand energy he would eventually become a \"privy government councillor\"\r\nand the next step would be to \"real privy government councillor, with\r\nthe predicate 'Your Excellency'.\" And since wives bore the titles of\r\ntheir husbands, the appeal was doubly strong.\r\n\r\nThe _Beamter_ enjoyed furthermore special protection under the law.\r\nTo call an ordinary person \"idiot,\" for example, was a _Beleidigung_\r\nor insult, but the same term applied to a _Beamter_ became\r\n_Beamtenbeleidigung_, or \"insult to an official,\" and involved a\r\nmuch sharper punishment, and this punishment increased with the\r\ndignity of the person insulted until the person of the Kaiser was\r\nreached, an insult to whom was _Majestaetsbeleidigung_, an insult to\r\nmajesty, or _lese majeste_, as the French term it. Prosecutions for\r\n_Majestaetsbeleidigung_ were not frequent, but the law was\r\noccasionally invoked. One of the last prosecutions for this offense\r\noccurred in 1913, when a man who had demonstratively turned a\r\npicture of the Kaiser toward the wall in the presence of a large\r\ngathering was sent to jail for four months.\r\n\r\nPersonal vanity was further exploited by a system of orders, decorations\r\nand civil-service medals. This system originated from an ancient custom\r\nwhich, with increasing travel, had become onerous. Royalty was\r\neverywhere expected to tip servants only with gold, and since the\r\nsmallest gold coin was the equivalent of the American $2.50-piece, this\r\nconstituted a severe financial tax on the poorer ruler of small\r\nprincipalities, who traveled much. One of these petty rulers conceived\r\nthe bright idea of creating a system of bronze orders or medallions and\r\nsubstituting these inexpensive decorations for tips. The event justified\r\nhis expectations; they were esteemed more highly than cash tips by\r\npeople whose vanity was flattered at receiving a \"decoration\" from\r\nroyalty. Eventually all states and the Empire adopted them. On fete days\r\nrailway station-masters could be recognized on the streets by their\r\nnumerous decorations. The railway-engineer, the mail-carrier, the\r\njanitor in a government office--all these men knew that so many years of\r\nloyal service meant recognition in the form of some sort of decoration\r\nfor the coat-lapel, and these, in the stratum of society in which they\r\nmoved, were just as highly regarded as was the Red Eagle or Hohenzollern\r\nHouse Order in higher classes of society. There is no room whatever for\r\ndoubt that these things, whose actual cost was negligible, played a\r\nlarge part in securing faithful and devoted service to the government\r\nand compensated largely--and especially in the case of higher\r\nofficials--for somewhat niggardly salaries. A prominent English\r\nstatesman, visiting Berlin some years before the war, expressed to the\r\nwriter his regret that England had not built up a similar system, which,\r\nin his opinion, was a powerful factor in securing a cheap and good\r\nadministration of public affairs. Like the system of titles, it took\r\nadvantage of a weakness not merely German, but human. Instances of the\r\nrefusal of foreign orders and decorations by Americans are rare.\r\n\r\nAll these things, then, were factors of almost inestimable value in\r\nbuilding up a strong governmental machine. At bottom, however, the\r\nwhole structure rested upon another factor which should receive\r\nungrudging admiration and recognition, regardless of one's attitude\r\ntoward Germany or its governing classes. This was the strong sense of\r\nduty inculcated in every German, man or woman, from lowest to highest.\r\nSelf-denial, a Spartan simplicity, faithfulness in the discharge of\r\none's obligations--these were the characteristics that set their seal\r\nupon the average German. In some of the larger cities, and notably in\r\nBerlin, the Spartan ideals of life had been somewhat abandoned in the\r\nyears preceding the war, but elsewhere they persisted, and nowhere to a\r\ngreater extent than among the ruling-classes of Prussia, the so-called\r\n_Junker_. Former Ambassador Gerard has paid a deserved tribute to this\r\nclass,[5] and the universal condemnation visited upon them by democratic\r\npeoples cannot justify a refusal to give them their due.\r\n\r\n[5] \"There is no leisure class among the Junkers. They are all\r\n    workers, patriotic, honest and devoted to the Emperor and the\r\n    Fatherland. If it is possible that government by one class is\r\n    to be suffered, then the Prussian Junkers have proved\r\n    themselves more fit for rule than any class in history. Their\r\n    virtues are Spartan, their minds narrow but incorruptible,\r\n    and their bravery and patriotism undoubted. One can but\r\n    admire them and their stern, virtues.\" James W. Gerard, _My\r\n    Four Years in Germany_, p. 123.\r\n\r\nThis uncompromising devotion to duty had its roots in old Prussian\r\nhistory. Frederick William I, father of Frederick the Great, threatened\r\nhis son with death if he were found derelict in what the stern old man\r\nregarded as the duty of a future ruler.\r\n\r\nThe whole rule of Frederick the Great was marked by a rigid sense of\r\nduty. He termed himself \"the first servant of the state,\" and no servant\r\nworked harder or allowed himself less leisure or fewer bodily comforts.\r\nIt was this monarch who, told of a brave act of sacrifice by one of his\r\nofficers, refused to consider it as anything calling for special\r\nrecognition. _Er hat nur seine verdammte Pflicht und Schuldigkeit getan_\r\n(he did only his accursed duty), said the King. This saying became the\r\nformula that characterized the attitude of the Prussian-German _Beamten_\r\nin their relations to the state. Whatever was (or was represented as)\r\ntheir \"accursed duty\" must be done, regardless of personal\r\nconsiderations or rewards.\r\n\r\nIn the catalogue of virtues enumerated we have one important group of\r\nprerequisites to efficient government. There remain two things:\r\nintelligence and education. The first can be dismissed briefly. The\r\naverage of intelligence in all civilized countries is probably much the\r\nsame. There would not be much difference in native capacity and ability\r\nbetween the best thousand of a million Germans or of a million men of\r\nany other race. In respect of education and training, however, German\r\nofficials as a whole were at least the equal of any body of government\r\nservants anywhere in the world and the superior of most. In the first\r\nplace, educational qualifications were definitely laid down for every\r\ncategory of officials. Nor were these qualifications determined, as in\r\nthe American civil-service, by an examination. The candidate must have\r\nattended school and taken the prescribed course for a term of years,\r\nvarying with the importance of the government career to which he\r\naspired.\r\n\r\nThis insured the possession of adequate educational qualifications of\r\ncivil servants, and there was another thing of first importance in the\r\nbuilding up of a strong and efficient civil-service. The \"spoils system\"\r\nin connection with public office was absolutely unknown in Germany. The\r\nidea that appointments to the government's service should depend upon\r\nthe political faith of the appointee was one that never occurred to any\r\nGerman. If it had occurred to him it would have been immediately\r\ndismissed as inconsistent with the best administration of the\r\ngovernment's affairs, as, indeed, it is. The only partisan\r\nqualification, or rather limitation, upon eligibility to public office\r\nwas that members of the Social-Democratic party were ineligible, and\r\nthat government employees might not become members of that party. From\r\nthe standpoint of the ruling-classes this was natural. It was more; it\r\nwas requisite. For the German Socialists were the avowed and\r\nuncompromising enemies of the existing government; they were advocates\r\nof a republic; they were the outspoken enemies of all authority except\r\nthe authority of their own class, for which they assumed to be the only\r\nlegitimate spokesmen, and they were, like Socialists the world over,\r\ninternationalists first and patriots second. No government could be\r\nexpected to help its bitterest opponents to power by giving places of\r\nhonor and profit to their representatives.\r\n\r\nThe tenure of government officials, except, of course, that of\r\nministers, was for life. Promotion was by merit, not by influence. The\r\nresult was an efficiency which is generally admitted. The municipal\r\nadministration of German cities in particular became the model for the\r\nworld. The system withstood the practical test; it worked. The Chief\r\nBurgomaster of Greater Berlin is a man whose whole life-training has\r\nbeen devoted to the administration of cities. Beginning in a subordinate\r\nposition in a small city, he became eventually its burgomaster (mayor),\r\nthen mayor of a larger city, and so on until he was called to take\r\ncharge of the administration of the empire's largest city. His career is\r\ntypical of the German pre-revolutionary methods of choosing public\r\nservants, and the same principle was applied in every department of the\r\ngovernment's service.\r\n\r\nFrom the purposely brief sketch of German officialdom's characteristics\r\nand efficiency which has been presented it will be apparent that such a\r\nsystem was a powerful weapon in the hands of any ruling-class. Its\r\nefficiency might reasonably be expected to crush any revolution in the\r\nbud, and the loyalty of the men composing it might equally be expected\r\nto maintain to the last their allegiance to the classes that represented\r\nauthority, with its supreme fount in the person of the ruler himself.\r\nThat these expectations were not fulfilled would seem to testify to the\r\ninherent and irresistible strength of the revolution that upset it. We\r\nshall see later, however, that it was a different class of men with whom\r\nthe revolution had to cope. Against the spirit of German officialdom of\r\nante-bellum days revolution would have raised its head in vain.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the German state had another and even more powerful\r\nweapon than the _Beamtentum_. This was the military establishment and\r\nthe officer-corps. Upon this in the first instance the throne of the\r\nHohenzollerns was supported.\r\n\r\nEnlightened democracy discovered centuries ago that a large standing\r\narmy may easily become the tool of absolutism and the enemy of free\r\ninstitutions. This discovery found expression in England in the\r\nconsistent refusal of Parliament to create an army in permanence. The\r\nlaws establishing the English army had to be renewed periodically, so\r\nthat it was possible at any time for the representatives of the people\r\nto draw the teeth of the military force if an attempt should be made to\r\nuse that force for tyrannical ends. But the Germans, as has already been\r\nexplained, lacked democratic training and perceptions. Germany was\r\nmoreover in a uniquely dangerous position. No other great power had such\r\nan unfavorable geographical situation. On the west was France, and there\r\nwere thousands of Germans who had been told by their fathers the story\r\nof the Napoleonic slavery. On the east was Russia, stronghold of\r\nabsolutism, with inexhaustible natural resources and a population more\r\nthan twice Germany's. Great Britain commanded the seas, and Germany had\r\nto import or starve.\r\n\r\nIt cannot fairly be doubted that, placed in a similar situation, the\r\nmost pacific nation would have armed itself to the teeth. But--and this\r\nis all-important--it is difficult to imagine that such other nation\r\nwould have become militaristic.\r\n\r\nThe stock answer of German apologists to the accusations regarding\r\n\"militarism\" as exemplified in Prussia-Germany has been the assertion\r\nthat France spent more money _per capita_ on her military establishment\r\nthan did Germany. This statement is true, but those making it overlooked\r\nthe real nature of the charge against them. They did not realize that\r\nmilitarism, as the world saw it in their country, was not concrete, but\r\nabstract; it was, in brief, a state of mind. It could have existed\r\nequally well if the army had been but a quarter as large, and it did not\r\nexist in France, which, in proportion to her population, had a larger\r\narmy than Germany. It exalted the profession of arms above all else; it\r\ndivided the people into two classes, military and civilians. Its spirit\r\nwas illustrated strikingly by the fact that when Wilhelm II ascended the\r\nthrone, his first act was to issue a proclamation to the army, but it\r\nwas not until three days later that his proclamation to the people was\r\nissued. Militarism gave the youngest lieutenant at court precedence over\r\nvenerable high civilian officials.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of militarism permeated even to the remotest corners of daily\r\nactivity in all walks of life. The gatekeeper at a railway crossing must\r\nstand at attention, with his red flag held in a prescribed manner, while\r\nthe train is passing. A Berlin mail-carrier was punished for saluting a\r\nsuperior with his left hand, instead of with the right. A street-car\r\nconductor was fined for driving his car between two wagons of a military\r\ntransport. This was in peace times, and the transport was conveying hay.\r\nThat the passengers in the car would otherwise have had to lose much\r\ntime was of no consequence; nothing could be permitted to interfere with\r\nanything hallowed by connection with the military establishment. When\r\nHerr von Bethmann Hollweg was appointed Imperial Chancellor it was\r\nnecessary to give him military rank, since he had never held it. He was\r\ncreated a general, for it could not be suffered that a mere civilian\r\nshould occupy the highest post in the empire next to the Kaiser. The\r\nKaiser rarely showed himself in public in civilian attire.\r\n\r\nIt was but natural that the members of the officer-corps held an exalted\r\nopinion of their own worth and dignity. Militarism is everywhere tarred\r\nwith the same stick, and army officers, if freed from effective civil\r\ncontrol, exhibit in all lands the same tendency to arbitrariness and to\r\na scorn and contempt for mere civilians. Such release from control is\r\nseen in other lands, however, only in time of war, whereas it was a\r\npermanently existing state of affairs in Germany. It worked more\r\npowerfully there than would have been the case anywhere else, for all\r\nthe country's traditions and history were of a nature to exalt military\r\nservice. Ravaged by war for centuries, Germany's greatness had been\r\nbuilt up by the genius of her army leaders and the bravery and loyalty\r\nof her soldiers. Hundreds of folksongs and poems known to every German\r\nchild glorified war and its heroes. The youthful Theodor Koerner, writing\r\nhis _Gebet vor der Schlacht_ (Prayer before the Battle) by the light of\r\nthe bivouac-fires a few hours before the battle in which he was killed,\r\nmakes a picture that must appeal even to persons who abhor war. How much\r\ngreater, then, must its appeal have been to a military folk!\r\n\r\nThe German officer was encouraged to consider himself of better clay\r\nthan the ordinary civilian. His \"honor\" was more delicate than the honor\r\nof women. It was no infrequent occurrence for an officer, willing to\r\nright by marriage a woman whom he had wronged, to be refused permission\r\neither because she did not have a dowry corresponding to his rank, or\r\nbecause she was of a lower social class. Duelling among officers was\r\nencouraged, and to step on an officer's foot, or even to stare too\r\nfixedly at him _(fixieren)_ was an insult calling for a duel. An\r\nofficer's credit was good everywhere. His word was as readily accepted\r\nas a civilian's bond, and honesty requires that it be said that his\r\ntrust was rarely misplaced. His exaggerated ideas of honor led\r\nfrequently to an arrogant conduct toward civilians, and occasionally to\r\nassaults upon offenders, which in a few instances took the form of a\r\nsummary sabering of the unfortunate victim.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] Some travelers and a certain class of correspondents have\r\n    unduly exaggerated the conditions referred to. They have\r\n    pictured murders of this sort as of frequent occurrence, and,\r\n    if they could be believed, German officers made it a custom\r\n    to require women in the street cars to surrender their seats\r\n    to them. In many years' residence in Germany the author\r\n    learned of but two cases of the murder of civilians by\r\n    officers, and he never saw a display of rudeness toward a\r\n    woman. The German officer almost invariably responded in kind\r\n    to courtesy, but he did expect and require deference from\r\n    civilians.\r\n\r\nThe crassest of the outward, non-political manifestations of militarism\r\nin recent years was the Zabern affair. A young lieutenant had sabered a\r\ncrippled shoemaker for a real or fancied offense against military rules.\r\nThe townspeople made a demonstration against the officer, and the\r\ncolonel commanding the regiment stationed at Zabern locked a number of\r\nthe civilians in the cellar of the barracks and kept them there all\r\nnight. This was too much even for a docile German Reichstag, and an\r\nexcited debate was followed by the passing of a vote of censure on a\r\ngovernment which, through the mouths of its Chancellor and War Minister,\r\nhad justified the colonel's actions. The colonel and the lieutenant were\r\nconvicted upon trial and adequate sentences were imposed upon them, but\r\nthe convictions were significantly set aside upon appeal and both\r\nescaped punishment. It was in connection with this affair that the\r\nGerman Crown Prince earned the censure of the soberer German elements by\r\nsending an encouraging telegram to the arbitrary colonel.\r\n\r\nMilitarism, in the aspects discussed, was a purely internal affair and\r\nconcerned only the German people themselves. But there was another\r\naspect, and it was this that made it a menace to the peace of the world\r\nand to true democracy.\r\n\r\nThe very possession of an admirable weapon is a constant temptation to\r\nuse it. This temptation becomes stronger in proportion as it springs\r\nwith inclination. The Germans of the last fifty years were not a\r\nbellicose people. They had suffered too greatly from wars within the\r\nrecollection of millions of men and women still living. On the other\r\nhand, they were familiar with war and the thought of it did not invoke\r\nthe same repugnant fears and apprehensions as among less sorely tested\r\npeoples. The mothers of every generation except the youngest knew what\r\nit meant to see husbands, sons and brothers don the King's coat and\r\nmarch away behind blaring bands; they knew the anxiety of waiting for\r\nnews after the battle, and the grief that comes with the announcement of\r\na loved one's death, and they considered it dimly, if they philosophized\r\nabout it at all, as one of the things that must be and against which it\r\nwere unavailing to contend. But the officers as a whole were bellicose.\r\nThe reasons are multifold. It is inherent in the profession that\r\nofficers generally are inclined to desire war, if for no other reason,\r\nthan because it means opportunities for advancement and high honors.\r\nBeyond this, the German officer's training and traditions taught him\r\nthat war was in itself a glorious thing.\r\n\r\nIn trying to understand the influences that dominated the government of\r\nGermany in its relations to foreign countries it must be clearly\r\nrealized and remembered that the real rulers of Germany came from the\r\ncaste that had for nearly two centuries furnished the majority of the\r\nmembers of the officer-corps. The Emperor-King, assuming to rule by the\r\ngrace of God, in reality ruled by the grace of the old nobility and\r\nlanded gentry of Prussia, from whose ranks he sprang. This had been\r\naptly expressed eighty years earlier by the poet Chamisso, in whose\r\n_Nachtwaechterlied_ appear the lines:\r\n\r\n            _Und der Koenig absolut,_\r\n            _Wenn er unseren Willen tut!_\r\n\r\n(Let the King be absolute so long as he does our will.) It was\r\ninevitable that the views of this class should determine the views of\r\ngovernment, and the only remarkable thing about the situation was that\r\nsome of the men who, by the indirect mandate of this caste, were\r\nresponsible for the conduct of the government, were less bellicose and\r\nmore pacific than their mandate-givers. There were some men who,\r\ninfected with the virus of militarism, dreamed of the _Welt-Imperium_,\r\nthe eventual domination of the world by Germany, to be attained by\r\npeaceful methods if possible, but under the threatening shadow of the\r\nempire's mighty military machine, which could be used if necessary. Yet\r\neven in their own caste they formed a minority.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief outline, was Germany--an empire built on the bayonets of\r\nthe world's greatest and most efficient army and administered by tens of\r\nthousands of loyal and efficient civil servants. How was it possible\r\nthat it could be overthrown?\r\n\r\nIn the last analysis it was not overthrown; it was destroyed from within\r\nby a cancer that had been eating at its vitals for eighty years. And the\r\nseeds of this cancer, by the strange irony of fate, were sown in Germany\r\nand cultivated by Germans.\r\n\r\nThe cancer was Socialism, or Social-Democracy, as it is termed in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n              Internationalism and Vaterlandslose Gesellen.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe concluding statement in the previous chapter must by no means be\r\ntaken as a general arraignment of Socialism, and it requires careful\r\nexplanation. Indiscriminately to attack Socialism in all its economic\r\naspects testifies rather to mental hardihood than to an understanding of\r\nthese aspects. A school of political thought which has so powerfully\r\naffected the polity of all civilized nations in the last fifty years and\r\nhas put its impress upon the statutes of those countries cannot be\r\nlightly dismissed nor condemned without qualification.\r\n\r\nCitizens of the recently allied countries will be likely also to see\r\nmerit in Socialism because of the very fact that, in one of its aspects,\r\nit played a large part in overthrowing an enemy government. Let this be\r\nclearly set down and understood at the very beginning: the aspects of\r\nSocialism that made the German governmental system ripe for fall were\r\nand are inimical not only to the governmental systems of all states, but\r\nto the very idea of the state itself.\r\n\r\nMore: The men responsible for the _debacle_ in Germany--and in\r\nRussia--regard the United States as the chief stronghold of capitalism\r\nand of the privilege of plutocracy, and the upsetting of this country's\r\ngovernment would be hailed by them with as great rejoicing as were their\r\nvictories on the continent.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of Socialism that makes it a menace to current theories of\r\ngovernment is \"internationalism\"--its doctrine that the scriptural\r\nteaching that all men are brothers must become of general application,\r\nand the negation of patriotism and the elimination of state boundaries\r\nwhich that doctrine logically and necessarily implies. And this doctrine\r\nwas \"made in Germany.\"\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of Socialism goes back to the eighteenth century, but its\r\nname was first formulated and applied by the Englishman Robert Owen in\r\n1835. Essentially this school of political thought maintains that land\r\nand capital generally--the \"instruments of production\"--should become\r\nthe property of the state or society. \"The alpha and omega of Socialism\r\nis the transformation of private competing aggregations of capital into\r\na united collective capital.\"[7] Ethically Socialism is merely New\r\nTestament Christianity, but, as will be seen later, it is in effect\r\noutspokenly material, irreligious and even actively anti-religious.\r\n\r\n[7] _Die Quintessenz des Sozialismus_, by Schaeffle.\r\n\r\nSocialism received its first clear and intelligent formulation at the\r\nhands of Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels, both Germans, although Marx was\r\nof Jewish descent. In 1847 these two men reorganized under the name\r\n\"Communist League\" a society of Socialists already in existence in\r\nLondon. The \"Manifesto of the Communist League\" issued by these two men\r\nin 1848 was the first real proclamation of a Socialism with outspoken\r\nrevolutionary and international aims. It demanded that the\r\nlaboring-classes should, after seizure of political might, \"by despotic\r\ninterference with the property rights and methods of production of the\r\n_bourgeoisie_, little by little take from them all capital and\r\ncentralize all instruments of production in the hands of the state, i.\r\ne., in the hands of the proletariat organized as the ruling-class.\" Marx\r\nand Engels recommended therefore the expropriation of real estate, the\r\nconfiscation of the property of all emigrants and the centralization in\r\nthe hands of the state of all means of credit (banks) and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nThe dominant idea of the Socialism of this period was that set forth by\r\nMarx in his book, _Das Kapital_, which became the textbook of the\r\nmovement. It was, in brief, that all wealth is produced by labor, and\r\nthat the surplus above the amount necessary for the bare existence of\r\nthe laborers is appropriated by the capitalists. Marx's admirers have\r\noften endeavored to show that the communism advocated by him in these\r\nfirst years was not the violent communism that has eventuated in the\r\nlast years in Bolshevism and kindred movements under other names. The\r\nquestion is of only academic interest, in view of the fact that Marx\r\nhimself later realized that existing institutions could not so easily be\r\noverturned as he had hoped and believed in 1848. Engels had also come to\r\na realization of the same fact, and in 1872, when the two men prepared a\r\nnew edition of the Manifesto of twenty-four years earlier, they admitted\r\nfrankly:\r\n\r\n        \"The practical application of these principles will always and\r\n        everywhere depend upon historically existing conditions, and we\r\n        therefore lay no especial stress upon the revolutionary measures\r\n        proposed. In the face of the tremendous development of industry\r\n        and of the organization of the laboring-classes accompanying\r\n        this development, as well as in view of practical experience,\r\n        this program is already in part antiquated. The Commune (of 1871\r\n        in Paris) has supplied the proof that the laboring-class cannot\r\n        simply take possession of the machinery of state and set it in\r\n        motion for its own purposes.\"\r\n\r\nThis awakening, however, came, as has been pointed out, nearly a quarter\r\nof a century after the founding of a Socialist kindergarten which openly\r\ntaught revolution. In its first years this kindergarten concerned itself\r\nonly with national (German) matters, and was only indirectly a menace to\r\nother countries by its tendency to awaken a spirit of unrest among the\r\nlaboring-classes and to set an example which might prove contagious. In\r\n1864, however, the _Internationale_ was founded with the cooperation of\r\nMarx and Engels, and Socialism became a movement which directly\r\nconcerned all the states of the world.\r\n\r\nThis development of Socialism was logical and natural, for its creed was\r\nessentially and in its origins international. It had originated in\r\nEngland in the days of the inhuman exploitation of labor, and especially\r\nchild-labor, by conscienceless and greedy capitalists. It had been tried\r\nout in France. Prominent among its advocates were many Russians, notably\r\nMichael Bakunin, who later became an anarchist. Perhaps the majority of\r\nits advocates on the continent were Jews or of Jewish descent, for no\r\nother race has ever been so truly international and so little bound by\r\nstate lines. The _Internationale_ had been in the air for years before\r\nit was actually organized; that organization was delayed for sixteen\r\nyears by no means indicates that the idea was new in 1864.\r\n\r\nThe basic idea of the _Internationale_ has already been referred to. It\r\naccepted as a working-creed the biblical doctrine that God \"hath made of\r\none blood all nations of men,\" but it disregarded the further\r\ndeclaration in the same verse of the Scriptures that He \"hath determined\r\nthe bounds of their habitation.\" The Socialist creed teaches the\r\nbrotherhood of man and the equality of all men irrespective of race,\r\ncolor or belief. The inescapable corollary of this creed is that\r\npatriotism, understood as unreasoning devotion to the real or supposed\r\ninterests of the state, cannot be encouraged or even suffered. And this\r\nstandpoint necessarily involves further the eventual obliteration of the\r\nstate itself, for any state's chief reason for existence in a\r\nnon-altruistic world is the securing of special privileges, benefits,\r\nadvantages and protection for its own citizens, without consideration\r\nfor the inhabitants of other states. If this exercise of its power be\r\nprohibited, the state's reason for existence is greatly diminished.\r\nIndeed, it can have virtually only a social mission left, and a social\r\nmission pure and simple cannot inspire a high degree of patriotism.\r\n\r\nMany non-Socialist thinkers have perceived the antithesis between the\r\ndoctrine of the universal brotherhood of man and the particularism of\r\nnational patriotism. Bjoernstjerne Bjoernson wrote: \"Patriotism is a stage\r\nof transition.\" This doctrine may come as a shock to the average reader,\r\nyet it is undoubtedly a prophetic and accurate statement of what will\r\nsome day be generally accepted. Thoughtfully considered, the idea will\r\nbe found less shocking than it at first appears. Neither Bjoernson nor\r\nany other non-Socialist contemplates the abandonment of patriotism and\r\nstate lines except by natural development. The world, in other words, is\r\nin a transitional stage, and when this transition shall have been\r\ncompleted it will find a world where the egoism of national patriotism\r\nhas made way for the altruism of internationalism. And this will have\r\nbeen accomplished without violent revolutionary changes, but merely by a\r\nnatural and peaceful evolutionary development.\r\n\r\nAgainst such a development, if it come in the manner described and\r\nanticipated, nobody can properly protest. But the Socialists of the\r\ninternational school--and this is what makes international Socialism a\r\nmenace to all governments and gradually but surely undermined the German\r\nstate--will not wait upon the slow processes of transition. Upon peoples\r\nfor whom the flags of their respective countries are still emblems of\r\ninterests transcending any conceivable interests of peoples outside\r\ntheir own state boundaries, emblems of an idea which must be\r\nunquestioningly and unthinkingly accepted and against which no dictates\r\nof the brotherhood of other men or the welfare of other human beings\r\nhave any claim to consideration, the Socialists would impose over night\r\ntheir idea of a world without artificial state lines, and would\r\nsubstitute the red flag for those emblems which the majority of all\r\nmankind still reverence and adore. It requires no profound thinking to\r\nrealize that such a change must be preceded by a long period of\r\npreparation if anarchy of production and distribution is to be avoided.\r\nTo impose the rule of an international proletariat under the present\r\nsocial conditions means chaos. The world has seen this exemplified in\r\nRussia, and yet Russia, where the social structure was comparatively\r\nsimple and industry neither complex nor widely developed, was the\r\ncountry where, if anywhere today, such an experiment might have\r\nsucceeded.\r\n\r\nSocialist leaders, including even the internationalists, have perceived\r\nthis. The murdered Jaures saw it clearly. But in the very nature of\r\nthings, the vast majority of the adherents of these doctrines are not\r\nprofound thinkers. Socialism naturally recruits itself from the lower\r\nclasses, and it is no disparagement to these to say that they are the\r\nleast educated. Even in states where the higher institutions of learning\r\nare free--and there are very few such places--the ability of the poor\r\nman's son to attend them is limited by the necessity resting upon him to\r\nmake his own living or to contribute to the support of his family. The\r\ntenets of national Socialism naturally appeal to the young man, who\r\nfeels that he and his fellows are being exploited by those who own the\r\n\"instruments of production,\" and who sees himself barred from the\r\neducational advantages which wealth gives. From the acceptance of the\r\neconomic tenets of national Socialism to advocacy of internationalism is\r\nbut a small step, easy to take for one who, in joining the Socialist\r\nparty, finds himself the associate of men who address him as \"comrade\"\r\nand who look forward to a day when all men, white, black or yellow,\r\nshall also be comrades under one flag and enlisted in one cause--the\r\ncause of common humanity. These men realize no more than himself the\r\nfact that existing social conditions are the result of historical\r\ndevelopment and that they cannot be violently and artificially altered\r\nwithout destroying the delicate balance of the whole machine. And since\r\nthis is the state of mind of the majority of the \"comrades,\" even the\r\nwisest leaders can apply the brakes only with great moderation, for the\r\nleader who lags too far behind the majority of his party ceases to be a\r\nleader and finds his place taken by less intelligent or less scrupulous\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nFerdinand Lassalle, the brilliant but erratic young man who organized\r\nthe first Socialist party in Germany, was a national Socialist. His\r\nparty grew slowly at first, and in 1864, when he died, it had but\r\n4,600 members. In 1863 Marx aided by August Bebel and Wilhelm\r\nLiebknecht,[8] formed the rival Confederation of German Unions upon an\r\ninternationalistic basis. This organization joined the _Internationale_\r\nat its congress in Nuremburg in 1868. The parties of Marx and Lassalle\r\nmaintained their separate identities until 1875, when they effected a\r\nfusion at a congress in Gotha. The Marx adherents numbered at that time\r\nabout 9,000 men and the Lassalle adherents some 15,000, but the latter\r\nhad already virtually accepted the doctrines of international Socialism\r\nand the _Internationale_, and the German Socialists had until the\r\nbreaking out of the World War maintained their place as the apostles and\r\nleaders of internationalism.\r\n\r\n[8] Called \"the elder Liebknecht\" to distinguish him from his son\r\n    Karl Liebknecht, who was killed while under arrest in Berlin\r\n    in the winter of 1919.\r\n\r\nSocialism first showed itself as a political factor in Germany in 1867,\r\nwhen five Socialists were elected to the North German Diet. Two\r\n_Genossen_[9] were sent to the first Reichstag in 1871, with a popular\r\nvote of 120,000, and six years later nearly a half million red votes\r\nwere polled and twelve Socialists took their seats in the Reichstag. The\r\nvoting-strength of the party in Berlin alone increased from 6,700 in\r\n1871 to 57,500 in 1877, or almost ninefold.\r\n\r\n[9] _Genosse_, comrade, is the term by which all German-speaking\r\n    Socialists address each other.\r\n\r\nA propaganda of tremendous extent and extreme ability was carried on. No\r\n_bourgeois_ German politician except Bismarck ever had such a keen\r\nappreciation of the power of the printed word as did those responsible\r\nfor Socialism's missionary work. Daily newspapers, weekly periodicals\r\nand monthly magazines were established, and German Socialism was soon in\r\npossession of the most extensive and best conducted Socialist press in\r\nthe world. The result was two-fold: the press contributed mightily to\r\nthe spreading of its party's doctrines and at the same time furnished a\r\nschool in which were educated the majority of the party leaders.\r\nProbably three quarters of the men who afterward became prominent in the\r\nparty owed their rise and, to a great extent, their general education to\r\ntheir service on the editorial staffs of their party's press. By\r\nintelligent reports and special Articles on news of interest to all\r\nmembers of the _Internationale_, whether German, French, English, or of\r\nwhat nationality they might be, this press made itself indispensable to\r\nthe leaders of that movement all over the world, and contributed greatly\r\nto influencing the ideas of the Socialists of other lands.\r\n\r\nBismarck's clear political vision saw the menace in a movement which\r\nopenly aimed at the establishment of a German republic and at the\r\neventual overthrow of all _bourgeois_ governments and the elimination of\r\nlocal patriotism and state lines. In 1878 he secured from the Reichstag\r\nthe enactment of the famous _Ausnahmegesetze_ or special laws, directed\r\nagainst the Socialists. They forbade Socialist publications and\r\nliterature in general, prohibited the holding of Socialist meetings or\r\nthe making of speeches by adherents of the party. Even the circulation\r\nof Socialist literature was prohibited. The _Ausnahmegesetze_ legalized\r\nas an imperial measure the treatment that had already been meted out to\r\nSocialists in various states of the Empire. Following the Gotha congress\r\nin 1875, fifty-one delegates to the congress were sent to prison.\r\nWilhelm Liebknecht received a sentence of three years and eight months\r\nand Bebel of two years and eleven months. In Saxony, from 1870 to 1875,\r\nfifty Socialists underwent prison sentences aggregating more than forty\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nBut Socialism throve on oppression. In politics, as in religion, the\r\nblood of the martyrs is the seed of the church. It would be praising any\r\nstatesman of the '80's too highly to say that he had learned that ideas\r\ncannot be combated with brute force, for the rulers of the world have\r\nnot yet learned it. But Bismarck did perceive that, to give any promise\r\nof success, opposition to Socialism must be based upon constructive\r\nstatesmanship. To many of the party's demands no objection could be made\r\nby intelligent society. And so, in the address from the throne in 1881,\r\nan extended program of state socialism was presented. With the enactment\r\nof this program into law Germany took the first important step ahead\r\nalong the road of state Socialism, and all her legislation for the next\r\nthirty years was profoundly influenced by socialistic thought, in part\r\nbecause of a recognition of the wisdom of some of Socialism's tenets, in\r\npart because of a desire to draw the party's teeth by depriving it of\r\ncampaign material.\r\n\r\nMore than a decade earlier the Catholic Church in Germany had recognized\r\nthe threatening danger and sought to counteract it by the organization\r\nof Catholic labor unions. It succeeded much better in its purpose than\r\ndid the government, which is not to be wondered at, since the temporal\r\naffairs of the church have always been administered more intelligently\r\nthan have the state affairs of any of the world's governments. For many\r\nyears Socialism made comparatively small gains in Roman Catholic\r\ndistricts. A similar effort by the Lutheran (State) Church in 1878\r\naccomplished little, and Bismarck's state Socialism also accomplished\r\nlittle to stop the spread of Socialist doctrines.\r\n\r\nKaiser Wilhelm II early realized the menace to the state of these\r\nenemies of patriotism and of all _bourgeois_ states. In a much quoted\r\nspeech he termed the Socialists _vaterlandslose Gesellen_ (fellows\r\nwithout a Fatherland). The designation stung all German Socialists, who,\r\nready as they were in theory to disavow all attachment to any state, did\r\nnot relish this kind of public denunciation by their monarch. The word\r\n_Gesellen_, too, when used in this sense has an unpleasant connotation.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists, whose political tenets necessarily made them opponents\r\nof royalty and monarchism everywhere, were particularly embittered\r\nagainst a Kaiser whose contempt for them was so openly expressed. Their\r\npress, which consistently referred to him baldly as \"Wilhelm II\" sailed\r\nas closely into the wind of _lese majeste_ as possible, and sometimes\r\ntoo closely. Leading Socialist papers had their special _Sitzredacteur_,\r\nor \"sitting-editor,\" whose sole function consisted in \"sitting out\" jail\r\nsentences for insulting the Kaiser or other persons in authority. Police\r\nofficials, taking their keynote from the Kaiser, prosecuted and\r\npersecuted Socialists relentlessly and unintelligently. Funeral\r\nprocessions were stopped to permit policemen to remove red streamers and\r\nribbons from bouquets on the coffins, and graves were similarly\r\ndesecrated if the friends or mourners had ventured to bind their floral\r\nofferings with the red of revolutionary Socialism. The laws authorizing\r\npolice supervision of all public meetings were relentlessly enforced\r\nagainst Socialists, and their gatherings were dissolved by the\r\npolice-official present at the least suggestion of criticism of the\r\nauthorities. There was no practical remedy against this abuse of power.\r\nAn appeal to the courts was possible, but a decision in June that a\r\nmeeting in the preceding January had been illegally dissolved did not\r\ngreatly help matters. Socialist meetings could not be held in halls\r\nbelonging to a government or municipality, and the Socialists often or\r\nperhaps generally found it impossible to secure meeting-places in\r\ndistricts where the Conservatives or National Liberals were in control.\r\nFederal, state and municipal employees were forbidden to subscribe for\r\nSocialist publications, or to belong to that party.\r\n\r\nThe extent of these persecutions is indicated by a report made to the\r\nSocialist congress at Halle in 1890, shortly after the _Ausnahmegesetze_\r\nhad expired by limitation, after a vain attempt had been made to get the\r\nReichstag to reenact them. In the twelve years that the law had been in\r\noperation, 155 journals and 1,200 books and pamphlets had been\r\nprohibited; 900 members of the party had been banished from Germany\r\nwithout trial; 1,500 had been arrested on various charges and 300 of\r\nthese punished for violations of the law.\r\n\r\nThe _Ausnahmegesetze_ failed of their purpose just as completely as did\r\nthe Six Acts[10] of 1820 in England. Even in 1878, the very year these\r\nlaws were enacted, the Socialists polled more votes than ever before. In\r\n1890 their total popular vote in the Empire was 1,427,000, which was\r\nlarger than the vote cast for any other single party. They should have\r\nhad eighty members in that year's Reichstag, but the shift in population\r\nand consequent disproportionateness of the election districts kept the\r\nnumber of Socialist deputies down to thirty-seven. At the Reichstag\r\nelection of 1893 their popular vote was 1,800,000, with forty-four\r\ndeputies.\r\n\r\n[10] These acts were passed by Parliament after the Manchester\r\n    Riots of 1819: to prevent seditious meetings for a discussion\r\n    of subjects connected with church or state; to subject cheap\r\n    periodical pamphlets on political subjects to a duty; to give\r\n    magistrates the power of entering houses, for the purpose of\r\n    seizing arms believed to be collected for unlawful purposes.\r\n\r\nIt may be seriously questioned whether Bismarck's unfortunate\r\nlegislation did not actually operate to increase the Socialists'\r\nstrength. Certain it is that it intensified the feeling of bitterness\r\nagainst the government, by men whose very creed compelled them to regard\r\nas their natural enemy even the most beneficent _bourgeois_ government,\r\nand who saw themselves stamped as Pariahs. This feeling found expression\r\nat the party's congress in 1880 at Wyden, when a sentence of the program\r\ndeclaring that the party's aim should be furthered \"by every lawful\r\nmeans\" was changed to read, \"by every means.\" It must in fairness be\r\nrecorded, however, that the revolutionary threat of this change appeared\r\nto have no effect on the subsequent attitude of the party leaders or\r\ntheir followers. The record of German Socialism is remarkably free from\r\nviolence and sabotage, and the revolution of 1918 was, as we shall see,\r\nthe work of men of a different stamp from the elder Liebknecht and the\r\nsturdy and honest Bebel.\r\n\r\nTwo great factors in the growth of Socialism in Germany remain to be\r\ndescribed. These were, first, the peculiar tendency of the Teutonic\r\nmind, already mentioned, to abstract philosophical thought, without\r\nregard to practicalities, and, second, the accident that the labor-union\r\nmovement in Germany was a child of party-Socialism.\r\n\r\nSocialism, in the last analysis, is nearer to New Testament Christianity\r\nthan is any other politico-economic creed, and the professions and\r\nhabits of thought of nearly all men in enlightened countries are\r\ndetermined or at least powerfully influenced by the precepts of Christ,\r\nno matter how far their practices may depart from these precepts. Few\r\neven of those most strongly opposed to Socialism oppose it on ethical\r\ngrounds. Their opposition is based on the conviction that it is\r\nunworkable and impracticable; that it fails to take into consideration\r\nthe real mainsprings of human action and conduct as society is today\r\nconstituted. In an ideally altruistic society, they admit, it would be\r\nfeasible, but, again, such a society would have no need of it. In other\r\nwords, the fundamental objection is the objection of the practical man.\r\nWhether his objection is insuperable it is no part of the purpose of the\r\nwriter to discuss. What it is desired to make plain is that Socialism\r\nappeals strongly to the dreamer, the closet-philosopher who concerns\r\nhimself with abstract ethical questions without regard to their\r\npracticality or practicability as applied to the economic life of an\r\nimperfect society. And there are more men of this type in Germany than\r\nin any other country.\r\n\r\nLoosely and inefficiently organized labor unions had existed in Germany\r\nbefore the birth of the Socialist movement, but they existed\r\nindependently of each other and played but a limited role. The first\r\nlabor organization of national scope came on May 23, 1863, at Leipsic,\r\nwhen Lassalle was instrumental in founding _Der allgemeine deutsche\r\nArbeiterverein_ (National German Workmen's Union). Organized labor, thus\r\ndefinitely committed to Socialism, remained Socialist. To become a\r\nmember of a labor union in Germany--or generally anywhere on the\r\ncontinent--means becoming an enrolled member of the Socialist party at\r\nthe same time. The only non-Socialist labor organizations in Germany\r\nwere the Catholic Hirsch-Duncker unions, organized at the instance of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church to prevent the spread of Socialism. These were\r\nboycotted by all Socialists, who termed them the \"yellow unions,\" and\r\nregarded them as union workmen in America regard non-union workers. It\r\ngoes without saying that a political party which automatically enrolls\r\nin its membership all workmen who join a labor union cannot help\r\nbecoming powerful.\r\n\r\nThat international Socialism is inimical to nationalism and patriotism\r\nhas already been pointed out, but a word remains to be said on this\r\nsubject with reference to specific German conditions. We have already\r\nseen how the Germany of the beginning of the nineteenth century was a\r\nloose aggregation of more than three hundred dynasties, most of which\r\nwere petty principalities. The heritage of that time was a narrowly\r\nlimited state patriotism which the Germans termed _Particularismus_, or\r\nparticularism. Let the American reader assume that the State of Texas\r\nhad originally consisted of three hundred separate states, each with its\r\nown government, and with customs and dialects varying greatly in the\r\nnorth and south. Assume further that, after seventy years filled with\r\nwarfare and political strife, these states had been re-formed into\r\ntwenty-six states, with the ruler of the most powerful at the head of\r\nthe new federation, and that several of the twenty-six states had\r\nreserved control over their posts, telegraphs, railways and customs as\r\nthe price for joining the federation. Even then he will have but a hazy\r\npicture of the handicaps with which the Imperial German Government had\r\nto contend.\r\n\r\nParticularism was to the last the curse and weakness of the German\r\nEmpire. The Prussian regarded himself first as a Prussian and only in\r\nsecond place as a German. The Bavarian was more deeply thrilled by the\r\nwhite-and-blue banner of his state than by the black-white-red of the\r\nEmpire. The republican Hamburger thanked the Providence that did not\r\nrequire him to live across the Elbe in the city of Altona, which was\r\nPrussian, and the inhabitants of the former kingdoms, duchies and\r\nprincipalities of Western Germany that became a part of Prussia during\r\nthe decades preceding the formation of the Empire regularly referred to\r\nthemselves as _Muss-Preussen_, that is, \"must-Prussians,\" or Prussians\r\nby compulsion.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to stretch this narrowly localized patriotism to make it\r\ncover the whole Empire could not but result in a seriously diluted\r\nproduct, which offered a favorable culture-medium for the bacillus of\r\ninternationalism. And in any event, to apply the standards of\r\nabstract ethical reasoning to patriotism is fatal. The result may be\r\nto leave a residue of traditional and racial attachment to one's\r\nstate, but that is not sufficient, in the present stage of human\r\nsociety, for the maintenance of a strong government. Patriotism of\r\nthe my-country-right-or-wrong type must, like revealed religion, be\r\naccepted on faith. German patriotism was never of this extreme type,\r\nand in attacking it the Socialists made greater headway than would\r\nhave been the case in most countries.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists had thus seriously weakened the state at two vital\r\npoints. By their continuous advocacy of a republic and their obstructive\r\ntactics they had impaired to a considerable extent the authority of the\r\nstate, and autocratic government rests upon authority. By their\r\ninternationalist teachings they had shaken the foundations of\r\npatriotism. And there is still another count against them.\r\n\r\nOpponents of Socialism accuse its advocates of being enemies of the\r\nChristian religion and the church. Socialists declare in reply that\r\nSocialism, being a purely economic school of thought, does not concern\r\nitself with religious matters in any manner. They point out further that\r\nthe programs of Socialist parties in all lands expressly declare\r\nreligion to be a private matter and one about which the party does not\r\nconcern itself. This is only part of the truth. It is true that\r\nSocialism officially regards religion as a private matter, but German\r\nSocialism--and the Socialism of other lands as well--is in practice the\r\nbitter enemy of the organized church. There is an abundance of evidence\r\nto prove this assertion, but the following quotations will suffice.\r\n\r\nAugust Bebel, one of the founders of German Socialism, said:\r\n\r\n    \"We aim in the domain of politics at Republicanism, in the\r\n    domain of economics at Socialism, and in the domain of what is\r\n    today called religion at Atheism.\"[11]\r\n\r\n[11] Quoted by W. H. Dawson in _German Socialism and Ferdinand\r\n    Lassalle_, ch. 15.\r\n\r\n_Vorwaerts_, central organ of German Socialism, wrote on July 1, 1892:\r\n\r\n    \"We would fight churches and preachers even if the preachers and\r\n    curates were the most conscientious of men.\"\r\n\r\n_Vorwaerts_ contrived also to add insult to the statement by using the\r\nword _Pfaffen_ for preachers, a word having a contemptuous implication\r\nin this sense throughout Northern Germany.\r\n\r\nKarl Kautsky, for years one of the intellectual leaders of the Socialist\r\nmovement in Germany and one of its ablest and most representative\r\npublicists, said:[12]\r\n\r\n    \"The one-sided battle against the congregations, as it is being\r\n    carried on today in France, is merely a pruning of the boughs of\r\n    the tree, which then merely flourishes all the more strongly.\r\n    The ax must be laid to the roots.\"\r\n\r\n[12] Die neue Zeit, 1903, vol. i, p. 506.\r\n\r\n_Genosse_ Dr. Erdmann, writing after the war had begun, said:\r\n\r\n    \"We have no occasion to conceal the fact that Social-Democracy\r\n    is hostile to the church--whether Catholic or Evangelical--and\r\n    that we present our demands with special decision because we\r\n    know that we shall thus break the power of the church.\"[13]\r\n\r\n[13] Sozialistische Monatshefte, 1915, vol. i, p. 516.\r\n\r\n_Vorwaerts_ headlined an Article in January, 1918: \"All religious systems\r\nare enemies of women.\" (The Socialists nevertheless had the effrontery\r\nduring the campaign preceding the election of delegates to the National\r\nAssembly at Weimar in January to put out a placard saying: \"Women,\r\nprotect your religion! Vote for the Social-Democratic party of\r\nGermany!\").\r\n\r\nThe initial activities of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils in\r\nHamburg and Brunswick following the revolution were correctly described\r\nin a speech made in the National Assembly on March 11, 1919, by Deputy\r\nMumm. He said:\r\n\r\n    \"The revolutionary government in Hamburg has retained the\r\n    bordells and abolished religious instruction. In Brunswick the\r\n    school children of the capital, 1,500 in number, were assembled\r\n    in the Cathedral by the people's commissioners for an\r\n    anti-Christian Christmas celebration.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same session, Deputy Hellmann, a member of the Majority (parent)\r\nSocialist party, said in a speech in answer to Mumm:\r\n\r\n    \"The church, like all social institutions, is subject to\r\n    constant change, and will eventually disappear.\"\r\n\r\nQuotations like the preceding could be multiplied indefinitely, as could\r\nalso acts consistent with these anti-religious views. The first Minister\r\nof Cults (_Kultusminister_) appointed by the revolutionary government in\r\nPrussia was Adolf Hoffmann, a professed atheist, although this ministry\r\nhas charge of the affairs of the church.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist literature and press in all countries abound in\r\nanti-religious utterances. To quote one is to give a sample of all. The\r\n_Social-Demokraten_ of Stockholm, official organ of the Swedish\r\nSocialists and reckoned among the sanest, ablest and most conservative\r\nof all Social-Democratic press organs, forgets, too, that religion is a\r\nprivate matter. It reports a sermon by Archbishop Soederblom, wherein the\r\nspeaker declared that the church must have enough expansive force to\r\nconquer the masses who are now coming to power in various lands, and\r\nadds this characteristic comment:\r\n\r\n    \"The Archbishop is a brave man who is not afraid to install a\r\n    motor in the venerable but antiquated skiff from the Lake of\r\n    Genesareth. If only the boat will hold him up!\"\r\n\r\nThis attitude of Socialism is comprehensible and logical, for no student\r\nof world history can deny that an established church has been in all\r\nages and still is one of the strongest bulwarks of an autocratic state.\r\nFrom the very dawn of organized government, centuries before the\r\nChristian era, the priesthood, where it did not actually govern, has\r\npowerfully upheld the arm of civil authority and property rights. Even\r\nin democratic England it teaches the child to \"be content in the station\r\nwhereto it has pleased God to call me,\" and is thus a factor in\r\nupholding the class distinctions against which Socialism's whole\r\ncampaign is directed. In opposing the church as an institution\r\nSocial-Democracy is thus merely true to its cardinal tenets. If the\r\npower of the church be destroyed or materially weakened, a serious blow\r\nis dealt to the government which that church supported. People who, at\r\nthe command of the church, have been unquestioningly rendering unto\r\nCaesar the things that are Caesar's, begin to ask themselves: \"But what\r\nthings are Caesar's?\" And when the people begin seriously to consider\r\nthis question, autocracy is doomed.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the Socialist campaign against the church began to make\r\nitself felt a decade or more before the war began. Withdrawals from the\r\nchurch became so frequent that the government was seriously concerned.\r\nThe number of those who termed themselves _Dissident_ (dissenter) or\r\n_religionslos_ (without any religion) increased rapidly. Clergymen\r\npreached the doctrines of Christ to empty benches; _religionslose\r\nGenossen_ preached the doctrines of class warfare and disloyalty to\r\nstate to Socialist audiences that filled their meeting-places.\r\n\r\nThus the cancer ate its way into the vitals of the Empire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n                  Germany under the \"Hunger-Blockade.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe men whose duty it was to take every measure to increase Germany's\r\npreparedness for war and her ability to carry on an extended conflict\r\nhad long realized that the Empire had one very vulnerable point. This\r\nwas her inability to feed and clothe her inhabitants and her consequent\r\ndependence on imports of foodstuffs and raw materials.\r\n\r\nGermany in the days of her greatness occupied so large a place in the\r\nsun that one is prone to forget that this mighty empire was erected on\r\nan area much less than that of the State of Texas. Texas, with 262,290\r\nsquare miles, was 53,666 square miles greater than the whole German\r\nEmpire. And Germany's population was two-thirds that of the entire\r\nUnited States! Germany was, moreover, comparatively poor in natural\r\nresources. The March (Province) Brandenburg, in which Berlin is\r\nsituated, is little more than a sandheap, and there are other sections\r\nwhose soil is poor and infertile. Nor was it, like America, virgin soil;\r\non the contrary, it had been cultivated for centuries.\r\n\r\nDriven by stern necessity, the Germans became the most intelligent and\r\nsuccessful farmers of the world. Their average yields of all crops per\r\nacre exceeded those of any other country, and were from one and a half\r\nto two times as large as the average yield in the United States. The\r\nGerman farmer raised two and one half times more potatoes per acre than\r\nthe average for the United States. He was aided by an adequate supply of\r\ncheap farm labor and by unlimited supplies of potash at low prices,\r\nsince Germany, among her few important natural resources, possessed a\r\nvirtual monopoly of the world's potash supply.\r\n\r\nTry as they would, however, the German farmers could not feed and clothe\r\nmore than about forty of Germany's nearly seventy millions. Even this\r\nwas a tremendous accomplishment, which can be the better appreciated if\r\none attempts to picture the State of Texas feeding and clothing four of\r\nevery ten inhabitants of the United States. Strenuous efforts were made\r\nby the German Government to increase this proportion. Moorlands were\r\nreclaimed and extensive projects for such reclamation were being\r\nprepared when the war came. The odds were too great, however, and the\r\nsteady shift of population toward the cities made it increasingly\r\ndifficult to cultivate all the available land and likewise increased the\r\namount of food required, since there is an inevitable wastage in\r\ntransportation. What this shift of population amounted to is indicated\r\nby the fact that whereas the aggregate population of the rural districts\r\nin 1871 was 63.9 per cent of the total population, it was but 40 per\r\ncent in 1910. During the same period the percentage of the total\r\npopulation living in cities of 100,000 population or over had increased\r\nfrom 4.8 to 21.3.\r\n\r\nIn the most favorable circumstances about three-sevenths of the food\r\nneeded by Germany must be imported. The government had realized that a\r\nwar on two fronts would involve a partial blockade, but neither the\r\nGerman Government nor any other government did or could foresee that a\r\nwar would come which would completely encircle Germany in effect and\r\nmake an absolute blockade possible. Even if this had been realized it\r\nwould have made no essential difference, for it must always have\r\nremained impossible for Germany to become self-supporting.\r\n\r\nAnother factor increased the difficulties of provisioning the people.\r\nThe war, by taking hundreds of able-bodied men and the best horses from\r\nthe farms, made it from the beginning impossible to farm as intensively\r\nas under normal conditions, and resulted even in the second summer of\r\nthe war in a greatly reduced acreage of important crops. Livestock,\r\ndepleted greatly by slaughtering and by lack of fodder, no longer\r\nproduced as much manure as formerly, and one of the main secrets of the\r\nintelligent farming-methods of the Germans was the lavish use of\r\nfertilizer. And thus, at a time when even the maximum production would\r\nhave been insufficient, a production far below the normal average was\r\nbeing secured.\r\n\r\nGermany's dependence on importations is shown by the import statistics\r\nfor 1913. The figures are in millions of marks.\r\n\r\n        Cereals                  1037.\r\n        Eggs                      188.2\r\n        Fruits                    148.8\r\n        Fish                      135.9\r\n        Wheaten products          130.3\r\n        Animal fats               118.9\r\n        Butter                    118.7\r\n        Rice                      103.9\r\n        Southern fruits           101.2\r\n        Meats                      81.4\r\n        Live animals              291.6\r\n        Coffee                    219.7\r\n        Cacao                      67.1\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the importations of cereals (bread-stuffs and\r\nmaize) alone amounted to roughly $260,000,000, without the further item\r\nof \"wheaten products\" for $32,500,000.\r\n\r\nFodder for animals was also imported in large quantities. The figures\r\nfor cereals include large amounts of Indian corn, and oilcakes were also\r\nimported in the same year to the value of more than $29,600,000.\r\n\r\nGermany was no more able to clothe and shoe her inhabitants than she was\r\nto feed them. Further imports for 1913 were (in millions of marks):\r\n\r\n        Cotton                    664.1\r\n        Wool                      511.7\r\n        Hides and skins           672.4\r\n        Cotton yarn               116.2\r\n        Flax and hemp             114.4\r\n        Woolen yarn               108.\r\n\r\nImports of chemicals and drugs exceeded $105,000,000; of copper,\r\n$86,000,000; of rubber and gutta-percha, $36,500,000; of leaf-tobacco,\r\n$43,500,000; of jute, $23,500,000; of petroleum, $17,400,000.\r\n\r\nOf foodstuffs, Germany exported only sugar and vegetable oils in any\r\nconsiderable quantities. The primarily industrial character of the\r\ncountry was evidenced by her exportations of manufactures, which\r\namounted in 1913 to a total of $1,598,950,000, and even to make these\r\nexportations possible she had imported raw materials aggregating more\r\nthan $1,250,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe war came, and Germany was speedily thrown on her own resources. In\r\nthe first months various neutrals, including the United States,\r\nsucceeded in sending some foodstuffs and raw materials into the\r\nbeleaguered land, but the blockade rapidly tightened until only the\r\nScandinavian countries, Holland, and Switzerland could not be reached\r\ndirectly by it. Sweden, with a production insufficient for her own\r\nneeds, soon found it necessary to stop all exports to Germany except of\r\ncertain so-called \"compensation articles,\" consisting chiefly of paper\r\npulp and iron ore. A continuance of these exports was necessary, since\r\nGermany required payment in wares for articles which Sweden needed and\r\ncould not secure elsewhere. The same was true of the other neutral\r\ncountries mentioned. Denmark continued to the last to export foodstuffs\r\nto Germany, but she exported the same quantity of these wares to\r\nEngland. All the exports of foodstuffs and raw materials from all the\r\nneutrals during the war were but a drop in the bucket compared with the\r\nvast needs of a people of seventy millions waging war, and they played a\r\nnegligible part in its course.\r\n\r\nAlthough the German Government was confident that the war would last but\r\na few months, its first food-conservation order followed on the heels of\r\nthe mobilization. The government took over all supplies of breadstuffs\r\nand established a weekly ration of four metric pounds per person (about\r\nseventy ounces). Other similar measures followed fast. Meat was\r\nrationed, the weekly allowance varying from six to nine ounces in\r\ndifferent parts of the Empire.[14] The Germans were not great\r\nmeat-eaters, except in the cities. The average peasant ate meat on\r\nSundays, and only occasionally in the middle of the week, and the ration\r\nfixed would have been adequate but for one thing. This was the\r\ndisappearance of fats, particularly lard, from the market. The Germans\r\nconsumed great quantities of fats, which took the place of meat to a\r\nlarge extent. They now found themselves limited to two ounces of butter,\r\nlard, and margarine together per week. Pork, bacon, and ham were\r\nunobtainable, and the other meats which made up the weekly ration were\r\nlean and stringy, for there were no longer American oilcakes and maize\r\nfor the cattle, and the government had forbidden the use of potatoes,\r\nrye or wheat as fodder. There had been some twenty-four million swine in\r\nGermany at the outbreak of the war. There were but four million left at\r\nthe end. Cattle were butchered indiscriminately because there was no\r\nfodder, and the survivors, undernourished, gave less and poorer meat per\r\nunit than normally.\r\n\r\n[14] This allowance had dropped to less than five ounces in\r\n    Prussia in the last months of the war.\r\n\r\nHow great a part milk pays in the feeding of any people is not generally\r\nrealized. In the United States recent estimates are that milk in its\r\nvarious forms makes up no less than nineteen per cent of the entire food\r\nconsumed. The percentage was doubtless much greater in Germany, where,\r\nas in all European countries, much more cheese is eaten per capita than\r\nin America. What the German farmer calls _Kraftfutter_, such\r\nconcentrated fodder as oilcakes, maize-meal, etc., had to be imported,\r\nsince none of these things were produced in Germany. The annual average\r\nof such importations in the years just preceding the war reached more\r\nthan five million metric tons, and these importations were virtually all\r\ncut off before the end of 1917.\r\n\r\nThe result was that the supply of milk fell off by nearly one half. Only\r\nvery young children, invalids, women in childbed and the aged were\r\npermitted to have any milk at all, and that only in insufficient\r\nquantities and of low grade. The city of Chemnitz boasted of the fact\r\nthat it had been able at all times to supply a quarter of a liter (less\r\nthan half a pint!) daily to every child under eight. That this should be\r\nconsidered worth boasting about indicates dimly what the conditions must\r\nhave been elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe value of eggs as protein-furnishing food is well known, but even\r\nhere Germany was dependent upon other countries--chiefly Russia--for\r\ntwo-fifths of her entire consumption. Available imports dropped to a\r\ntenth of the pre-war figures, and the domestic production fell off\r\ngreatly, the hens having been killed for food and also because of lack\r\nof fodder.\r\n\r\nRestriction followed upon restriction, and every change was for the\r\nworse. The _Kriegsbrot_ (war bread) was directed to be made with twenty\r\nper cent of potatoes or potato flour and rye. Barley flour was later\r\nadded. Wheat and rye are ordinarily milled out around 70 to 75 per cent,\r\nbut were now milled to 94 per cent. The bread-ration was reduced. The\r\nsugar-ration was set at 1-3/4 pounds monthly. American housewives\r\nthought themselves severely restricted when sugar was sold in pound\r\npackages and they could buy as much heavy molasses, corn syrups and\r\nmaple syrup as they desired, but the 1-3/4-pound allowance of the German\r\nhousewife represented the sum total of all sweets available per month.\r\n\r\nBy the autumn of 1916 conditions had become all but desperate. It is\r\ndifficult for one who has not experienced it personally to realize what\r\nit means to subsist without rice, cereals such as macaroni, oatmeal, or\r\nbutter, lard or oil (for two ounces of these articles are little better\r\nthan none); to be limited to one egg each three weeks, or to five pounds\r\nof potatoes weekly; to have no milk for kitchen use, and even no spices;\r\nto steep basswood blossoms as a substitute for tea and use dandelion\r\nroots or roasted acorns as coffee for which there is neither milk nor\r\nsugar, and only a limited supply of saccharine. Germany had been a\r\ncountry of many and cheap varieties of cheese, and these took the place\r\nof meat to a great extent. Cheese disappeared entirely in August, 1916,\r\nand could not again be had.\r\n\r\nIn common with most European peoples, the Germans had eaten great\r\nquantities of fish, both fresh and salted or smoked. The bulk of the\r\nsalted and smoked fish had come from Scandinavia and England, and the\r\nblockade cut off this supply. The North Sea was in the war-zone, and the\r\nGerman fishermen could not venture out to the good fishing-grounds. The\r\nGerman fishermen of the Baltic had, like their North Seacoast brethren,\r\nbeen called to the colors in great numbers. Their nets could not be\r\nrepaired or renewed because there was no linen available. Fresh fish\r\ndisappeared from view, and supplies of preserved fish diminished so\r\ngreatly that it was possible to secure a small portion only every third\r\nor fourth week. Even this trifling ration could not always be\r\nmaintained.\r\n\r\nNo German will ever forget the terrible _Kohlruebenwinter_ (turnip\r\nwinter) of 1916-17. It took its name from the fact that potatoes were\r\nfor many weeks unobtainable, and the only substitute that could be had\r\nwas coarse fodder-turnips. The lack of potatoes and other vegetables\r\nincreased the consumption of bread, and even in the case of the\r\nbetter-situated families the ration was insufficient. The writer has\r\nseen his own children come into the house from their play, hungry and\r\nasking for a slice of bread, and go back to their games with a piece of\r\nturnip because there was no bread to give them. The situation of hard\r\nmanual laborers was naturally even worse.\r\n\r\nThe turnip-winter was one of unusual severity, and it was marked by a\r\nserious shortage of fuel. Thus the sufferings from the cold were added\r\nto the pangs of hunger. There was furthermore already an insufficiency\r\nof warm clothing.Articles of wear were strictly rationed, and the\r\nchildren of the poorer classes were inadequately clad.\r\n\r\nThe minimum number of calories necessary for the nourishment of the\r\naverage individual is, according to dietetic authorities, 3,000, and\r\neven this falls some 300 short of a full ration. Yet as early as\r\nDecember, 1916, the caloric value of the complete rations of the German\r\nwas 1,344, and, if the indigestibility and monotony of the fare be taken\r\ninto account, even less. To be continuously hungry, to rise from the\r\ntable hungry, to go to bed hungry, was the universal experience of all\r\nbut the very well-to-do. Not only was the food grossly insufficient in\r\nquantity and of poor quality, but the deadly monotony of the daily fare\r\nalso contributed to break down the strength and, eventually, the very\r\nmorale of the people. No fats being available, it was impossible to fry\r\nanything. From day to day the Germans sat down to boiled potatoes,\r\nboiled turnips and boiled cabbage, with an occasional piece of stringy\r\nboiled beef or mutton, and with the coarse and indigestible\r\n_Kriegsbrot_, in which fodder-turnips had by this time been substituted\r\nfor potatoes. The quantity of even such food was limited.\r\n\r\nA little fruit would have varied this diet and been of great dietetic\r\nvalue, but there was no fruit. _Wo bleibt das Obst_ (what has become of\r\nthe fruit?) cried the people, voicing unconsciously the demands of their\r\nbodies. The government, which had imported $62,500,000 worth of fruit in\r\n1913, could do nothing. The comparatively few apples raised in Germany\r\nwere mixed with pumpkins and carrots to make what was by courtesy called\r\nmarmalade, and most of this went to the front, which also secured most\r\nof the smaller fruits. A two-pound can of preserved vegetables or fruits\r\nwas sold to each family--not person--at Christmas time. This had to\r\nsuffice for the year.\r\n\r\nA delegation of women called on the mayor of Schoeneberg, one of the\r\nmunicipalities of Greater Berlin, and declared that they and their\r\nfamilies were hungry and must have more to eat.\r\n\r\n\"You will not be permitted to starve, but you must hunger,\" said the\r\nmayor.[15]\r\n\r\n[15] The mayor's statement contains in German a play on words:\r\n    _Ihr sollt nicht verhungern, aber hungern muesst Ihr_.\r\n\r\nThe other privations attendant upon hunger also played a great part in\r\nbreaking down the spirit of the people. In order to secure even the\r\nofficial food-pittance, it was necessary to stand in queues for hours at\r\na time. The trifling allowance of soap consisted of a substitute made\r\nlargely of saponaceous clay. Starch was unobtainable, and there is a\r\ndeep significance in the saying, \"to take the starch out of one.\" The\r\nenormous consumption of tobacco at the front caused a serious shortage\r\nat home, and this added another straw to the burdens of the male part of\r\nthe population. The shortage of cereals brought in its wake a dilution\r\nof the once famous German beer until it was little but colored and\r\ncharged water, without any nourishment whatever.\r\n\r\nThe physical effects of undernutrition and malnutrition made themselves\r\nfelt in a manner which brought them home to every man. Working-capacity\r\ndropped to half the normal, or even less. Mortality increased by leaps\r\nand bounds, particularly among the children and the aged. The death rate\r\nof children from 1 to 5 years of age increased 50 per cent; that of\r\nchildren from 5 to 15 by 55 per cent. In 1917 alone this increased death\r\nrate among children from 1 to 15 years meant an excess of deaths over\r\nthe normal of more than 50,000 in the whole Empire. In the year 1913,\r\n40,374 deaths from tuberculosis were reported in German municipalities\r\nof 15,000 inhabitants or more. The same municipalities reported 41,800\r\ndeaths from tuberculosis in the first six months of 1918, an increase of\r\nmore than 100 per cent. In Berlin alone the death rate for all causes\r\njumped from 13.48 per thousand for the first eight months of 1913 to\r\n20.05 for the first eight months of 1918.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report laid before the United Medical Societies in Berlin\r\non December 18, 1918, the \"hunger blockade\" was responsible for 763,000\r\ndeaths in the Empire. These figures are doubtless largely based on\r\nspeculation and probably too high, but one need not be a physician to\r\nknow that years of malnutrition and undernutrition, especially in the\r\ncase of children and the aged, mean a greatly increased death rate and\r\nparticularly a great increase of tuberculosis. In addition to the excess\r\ndeaths alleged by the German authorities to be directly due to the\r\nblockade, there were nearly 150,000 deaths from Spanish influenza in\r\n1918. These have not been reckoned among the 763,000, but it must be\r\nassumed that many would have withstood the attack had they not been\r\nweakened by the privations of the four war-years.\r\n\r\nThe enthusiasm that had carried the people through the beginnings of\r\ntheir privations cooled gradually. No moral sentiments, even the most\r\nexalted, can prevail against hunger. Starving men will fight or steal to\r\nget a crust of bread, just as a drowning man clutches at a straw. There\r\nhave been men in history whose patriotism or devotion to an idea has\r\nwithstood the test of torture and starvation, but that these are the\r\nexception is shown by the fact that history has seen fit to record their\r\ndeeds. The average man is not made of such stern stuff. _Mens sana in\r\ncorpore sano_ means plainly that there can be no healthy mind without a\r\nhealthy body. Hungry men and women who see their children die for want\r\nof food naturally feel a bitter resentment which must find an object.\r\nThey begin to ask themselves whether, after all, these sacrifices have\r\nbeen necessary, and to what end they have served.\r\n\r\nThe first answer to the question, What has compelled these sacrifices\r\nwas, of course, for everybody, The war. But who is responsible for The\r\nWar? Germany's enemies, answered a part of the people.\r\n\r\nBut there were two categories of Germans whose answer was another. On\r\nthe one side were a few independent thinkers who had decided that\r\nGermany herself bore at least a large share of the responsibility; on\r\nthe other side were those who had been taught by their leaders that all\r\nwars are the work of the capitalistic classes, and that existing\r\ngovernments everywhere are obstacles to the coming of a true universal\r\nbrotherhood of man. These doctrines had been forgotten by even the\r\nSocialist leaders in the enthusiasm of the opening days of the struggle,\r\nbut they had merely lain dormant, and now, as a result of sufferings and\r\nrevolutionary propaganda by radical Socialists, they awakened. And in\r\nawakening they spread to a class which had heretofore been comparatively\r\nfree from their contagion.\r\n\r\nSocialism, and more especially that radical Socialism which finds its\r\nexpression in Bolshevism, Communism and similar emanations, is\r\nespecially the product of discontent, and discontent is engendered by\r\nsuffering. The whole German people had suffered terribly, but two\r\ncategories of one mighty class had undergone the greatest hardships.\r\nThese were the _Unterbeamten_ and the _Mittelbeamten_, the government\r\nemployees of the lowest and the middle classes. This was the common\r\nexperience of all belligerent countries except the United States, which\r\nnever even remotely realized anything of what the hardships of war mean.\r\nWages of the laboring classes generally kept pace with the increasing\r\nprices of the necessaries of life, and in many instances outstripped\r\nthem. But the government, whose necessities were thus exploited by the\r\nmakers of ammunition, the owners of small machine-shops and the hundreds\r\nof other categories of workers whose product was required for the\r\nconduct of the war, could not--or at least did not--grant corresponding\r\nincreases of salary to its civil servants. The result was a curious\r\nsocial shift, particularly observable in the restaurants and resorts of\r\nthe better class, whose clientele, even in the second year of the war,\r\nhad come to be made up chiefly of men and women whose bearing and dress\r\nshowed them to be manual workers. The slender remuneration of the\r\n_Beamten_ had fallen so far behind the cost of living that they could\r\nneither frequent these resorts nor yet secure more than a bare minimum\r\nof necessaries. The result was that thousands of these loyal men and\r\nwomen, rendered desperate by their sufferings, began in their turn to\r\nponder the doctrines which they had heard, but rejected in more\r\nprosperous times. Thus was the ground further prepared for the coming of\r\nthe revolution.\r\n\r\nThere was yet another factor which played a great part in increasing the\r\ndiscontent of the masses. Not even the genius of the German Government\r\nfor organization could assure an equitable distribution of available\r\nfoodstuffs. Except where the supply could be seized or controlled at the\r\nsource, as in the case of breadstuffs and one or two other products, the\r\nrationing system broke down. The result of the government's inability to\r\nget control of necessaries of life was the so-called _Schleichhandel_,\r\nliterally \"sneak trade,\" the illegitimate dealing in rationed wares.\r\nHeavy penalties were imposed for this trade, applicable alike to buyer\r\nand seller, and many prosecutions were conducted, but to no avail. The\r\nextent of the practice is indicated by a remark made by the\r\npolice-president of a large German city, who declared that if every\r\nperson who had violated the law regarding illegitimate trade in\r\nfoodstuffs were to be arrested, the whole German people would find\r\nitself in jail.\r\n\r\nIt has often been declared that money would buy anything in Germany\r\nthroughout the war. This statement is exaggerated, but it is a fact that\r\nthe well-to-do could at all times secure most of the necessaries and\r\nsome of the luxuries of life. But the prices were naturally so high as\r\nto be out of the reach of the great mass of the people. Butter cost as\r\nmuch as $8 a pound in this illegitimate trade, meat about the same, eggs\r\n40 to 50 cents apiece, and other articles in proportion. The poorer\r\npeople--and this, in any country, means the great majority--could not\r\npay these prices. Themselves forced to go hungry and see their children\r\nhunger while the wealthy _bourgeoisie_ had a comparative abundance, they\r\nwere further embittered against war and against all governments\r\nresponsible for war, including their own.\r\n\r\nThe German soldiers at the front had fared well by German standards. In\r\nthe third year of the war the writer saw at the front vast stores of\r\nham, bacon, beans, peas, lentils and other wares that had not been\r\navailable to the civil population since the war began. Soldiers home on\r\nfurlough complained of being continuously hungry and returned to the\r\nlines gladly because of the adequate rations there.\r\n\r\nWith the coming of the fourth year, however, conditions began to grow\r\nbad even at the front, and the winter of 1917-18 brought a marked\r\ndecrease of rations, both in quantity and quality. Cavalrymen and\r\nsoldiers belonging to munition or work columns ate the potatoes issued\r\nfor their horses. They ground in their coffee-mills their horses' scant\r\nrations of barley and made pancakes. A high military official who took\r\npart in the drive for the English Channel that started in March, 1918,\r\nassured the writer that the chief reason for the failure to reach the\r\nobjective was that the German soldiers stopped to eat the provisions\r\nfound in the enemy camps, and could not be made to resume the advance\r\nuntil they had satisfied their hunger and assured themselves that none\r\nof the captured stores had been overlooked. Ludendorff, hearing of this,\r\nis said to have declared: \"Then it's all over.\" This, while probably\r\nuntrue, would have been a justified and prophetic summing-up of the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nNot only were the soldiers hungry by this time, but they were\r\ninsufficiently clad. Their boots were without soles, and they had\r\nneither socks nor the _Fusslappen_ (bandages) which most of them\r\npreferred to wear instead of socks. A shirt issued from the military\r\nstores in the summer of 1918 to a German soldier-friend of the writer\r\nwas a woman's ribbed shirt, cut low in the neck and gathered with a\r\nribbon.\r\n\r\nThe military reverses of this summer thus found a soldiery hungry and\r\nill-clad, dispirited by complaints from their home-folk of increasing\r\nprivations, and, as we shall see in the following chapter, subjected to\r\na revolutionary propaganda of enormous extent by radical German\r\nSocialists and by the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n                       Internationalism at Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo people ever entered upon a war with more enthusiasm or a firmer\r\nconviction of the justice of their cause than did the Germans. Beset for\r\ngenerations on all sides by potential enemies, they had lived under the\r\nconstant threat of impending war, and the events of the first days of\r\nAugust, 1914, were hailed as that \"end of terror\" (_ein Ende mit\r\nSchrecken_) which, according to an old proverb, was preferable to\r\n\"terror without end\" (_Schrecken ohne Ende_). The teachings of\r\ninternationalism were forgotten for the moment even by the Socialists.\r\nThe veteran August Bebel, one of the founders of German Socialism, had\r\nnever been able entirely to overcome an inborn feeling of nationalism,\r\nand had said in one famous speech in the Reichstag that it was\r\nconceivable that a situation could arise where even he would shoulder\r\n_die alte Buechse_ (the old musket) and go to the front to defend the\r\nFatherland.\r\n\r\nSuch a situation seemed even to the extremest internationalists to have\r\narisen. At the memorable meeting in the White Hall of the royal palace\r\nin Berlin on August 4, 1914, the Socialist members of the Reichstag were\r\npresent and joined the members of the _bourgeois_ parties in swearing to\r\nsupport the Fatherland. The Kaiser retracted his reference to\r\n_vaterlandslose Gesellen_. \"I no longer know any parties,\" he said. \"I\r\nknow only Germans.\" Hugo Haase, one of the Socialist leaders and one of\r\nthe small group of men whose efforts later brought about the German\r\nrevolution and the downfall of the empire and dynasty, was carried away\r\nlike his colleagues by the enthusiasm of the moment. He promised in\r\nadvance the support of his party to the empire's war measures, and when,\r\na few hours later, the first war-appropriation measure, carrying five\r\nbillion marks, was laid before the deputies, the Socialists voted for it\r\nwithout a dissenting voice, and later joined for the first time in their\r\nhistory in the _Kaiserhoch_, the expression of loyalty to monarch and\r\ncountry with which sessions of the Reichstag were always closed.\r\n\r\nNothing could testify more strongly to the universal belief that Germany\r\nwas called upon to fight a defensive and just war. For not only had the\r\nSocialist teachings, as we have seen, denounced all warfare as in the\r\ninterests of capital alone, but their party in the Reichstag included\r\none man whose anti-war convictions had already resulted in his being\r\npunished for their expression. This was Dr. Karl Liebknecht, who had\r\nbeen tried at the Supreme Court in Leipsic in 1907 on a charge of high\r\ntreason for publishing an anti-military pamphlet, convicted of a lesser\r\ndegree of treason and sentenced to eighteen months' imprisonment. Haase\r\nhimself had bitterly attacked militarism and war in a speech in the\r\nReichstag in April, 1913, in opposition to the government's military\r\nbills, and only his parliamentary immunity protected him from sharing\r\nLiebknecht's fate. One of the strongest defenders of the war in Bavaria\r\nwas Kurt Eisner, already an intellectual Bolshevist and Communist, who\r\nhad been compelled earlier to leave the editorial staff of the\r\n_Vorwaerts_ because of his far-going radicalism and dreamy\r\nimpracticality.\r\n\r\nAll these men were subsequently bitterly attacked by Socialists of\r\nenemy lands for their surrender of principles. The feeling that\r\ndictated these attacks is comprehensible, but adherents of the\r\nmy-country-right-or-wrong brand of patriotism are precluded from making\r\nsuch attacks. It cannot be permitted to any one to blow hot and cold at\r\nthe same time. He may not say: \"I shall defend my country right or\r\nwrong, but you may defend yours only if it is right.\" To state the\r\nproposition thus baldly is to destroy it. Unquestioning patriotism is\r\napplicable everywhere or nowhere, and its supporters cannot logically\r\ncondemn its manifestation by the German Socialists in the opening months\r\nof the World War.\r\n\r\nThe first defection in the ranks of the Socialists came in the second\r\nwar session of the Reichstag in December, 1914, when Liebknecht, alone\r\namong all the members of the house, refused to vote for the government's\r\nwar-credit of five billion marks. Amid scenes of indignant excitement he\r\ntried to denounce the war as imperialistic and capitalistic, but was not\r\npermitted to finish his remarks.\r\n\r\nThere has been observable throughout the allied countries and\r\nparticularly in America a distinct tendency to regard Liebknecht as a\r\nhero and a man of great ability and moral courage. But he was neither\r\nthe one nor the other. He was a man of great energy which was\r\nexclusively devoted to destroying, and without any constructive ability\r\nwhatever, and what was regarded as moral courage in him was rather the\r\nindifferent recklessness of fanaticism combined with great egotism and\r\npersonal vanity. Liebknecht's career was in a great degree determined by\r\nhis feeling that he was destined to carry on the work and fulfil the\r\nmission of his father, Wilhelm Liebknecht, the friend of Marx, Bebel and\r\nEngels, and one of the founders of the Socialist party in Germany. But\r\nhe lacked his father's mental ability, commonsense and balance, and the\r\nresult was that he became the _enfant terrible_ of his party at an age\r\nwhen the designation applied almost literally.\r\n\r\nEducated as a lawyer, the younger Liebknecht devoted himself almost\r\nexclusively to politics and to writing on political subjects. Last\r\nelected to the Reichstag from the Potsdam district in 1912, he\r\ndistinguished himself in April, 1913, by a speech in which he charged\r\nthe Krupp directors with corrupting officials and military officers. He\r\nalso named the Kaiser and Crown Prince in his speech. The result was an\r\ninvestigation and trial of the army officers involved. In making these\r\ncharges Liebknecht performed a patriotic service, but even here his\r\npersonal vanity asserted itself. Before making the speech he sent word\r\nto the newspapers that he would have something interesting to say, and\r\nrequested a full attendance of reporters. He delayed his speech after\r\nthe announced time because the press-gallery was not yet full.\r\n\r\nA consistent enemy of war, he attacked the international armament\r\nindustry in a speech in the Reichstag on May 10, 1914. In the following\r\nmonth he charged the Prussian authorities with trafficking in titles.\r\nBut in all the record of his public activities--and he was forty-three\r\nyears old when the war broke out--one will search in vain for any\r\nconstructive work or for any evidence of statesmanlike qualities.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht visited America in 1910. When he returned to Germany he\r\nattacked America in both speeches and writings as the most imperialistic\r\nand capitalistic of all countries. He declared that in no European\r\ncountry would the police dare handle citizens as they did in America,\r\nand asserted that the American Constitution is \"not worth the paper it\r\nis written upon.\" In Berlin on December 17, 1918, he said to the writer:\r\n\r\n    \"The war has proved that your constitution is no better today\r\n    than it was when I expressed my opinion of it nine years ago.\r\n    Your people have been helpless in the face of it and were drawn\r\n    into war just like the other belligerents. The National Assembly\r\n    (Weimar) now planned will bequeath to us a charter equally as\r\n    worthless. The workingmen are opposed to the perpetuation of\r\n    private ownership.\"\r\n\r\nIn the face of this, it must be assumed that American glorification of\r\nLiebknecht rests upon ignorance of the man and of what principles he\r\nsupported.\r\n\r\nFor a few months after the beginning of the war Liebknecht stood almost\r\nalone in his opposition. As late as September, 1914, we see Haase\r\nheading a mission of Socialists to Italy to induce her to be faithful to\r\nher pledges under the Triple Alliance and to come into the war on\r\nGermany's side, or, failing that, at least to remain neutral. Haase, who\r\nwas a middle-aged Koenigsberg (East Prussia) lawyer, had for some years\r\nbeen one of the prominent leaders of the Social-Democratic party and was\r\nat this time one of the chairmen of the party's executive committee. He\r\nwas later to play one of the chief roles in bringing about the\r\nrevolution, but even in December, 1914, he was still a defender of the\r\nwar, although already insistent that it must not end in annexations or\r\nthe oppression of other peoples. It was not until a whole year had\r\npassed that he finally definitely threw in his lot with those seeking to\r\nweaken the government at home and eventually destroy it.\r\n\r\nThe real undermining work, however, had begun earlier. Several men and\r\nat least two women were responsible for it at this stage. The men\r\nincluded Liebknecht, Otto Ruehle, a former school teacher from Pirna\r\n(Saxony), and now a member of the Reichstag, and Franz Mehring. Ruehle, a\r\npersonal friend of Liebknecht, broke with his party at the end of 1914\r\nand devoted himself to underground propaganda with an openly\r\nrevolutionary aim, chiefly among the sailors of the High Seas fleet.\r\nMehring was a venerable Socialist author of the common idealistic,\r\nnon-practical variety, with extreme communistic and international views,\r\nand enjoyed great respect in his party and even among non-Socialist\r\neconomists. The two women referred to were Clara Zetkin, a radical\r\nsuffragette of familiar type, and Rosa Luxemburg.\r\n\r\nThe Luxemburg woman was, like so many others directly concerned in the\r\nGerman revolution, of Jewish blood. By birth in Russian Poland a Russian\r\nsubject, she secured German citizenship in 1870 by marrying a _Genosse_,\r\na certain Dr. Luebeck, at Dresden. She left him on the same day. Frau\r\nLuxemburg had been trained in the school of Russian Socialism of the\r\ntype that produced Lenin and Trotzky. She was a woman of unusual\r\nability--perhaps the brainiest member of the revolutionary group in\r\nGermany, male or female--and possessed marked oratorical talent and\r\ngreat personal magnetism. Like all internationalists and especially the\r\nJewish internationalists, she regarded war against capitalistic and\r\nimperialistic governments, that is to say, against all _bourgeois_\r\ngovernments, as a holy war. Speaking Russian, Polish and German equally\r\nwell and inflamed by what she considered a holy mission, she was a\r\nsource of danger to any government whose hospitality she was enjoying.\r\nShe became early an intimate of Liebknecht and the little group of\r\nradicals that gathered around him, and her contribution to the overthrow\r\nof the German Empire can hardly be overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe first of the anti-war propaganda articles whose surreptitious\r\ncirculation later became so common were the so-called \"Spartacus\r\nLetters,\" which began appearing in the summer of 1915. There had been\r\nformed during the revolution of 1848 a democratic organization calling\r\nitself the \"Spartacus Union.\" The name came from that Roman gladiator\r\nwho led a slave uprising in the last century of the pre-Christian era.\r\nThis name was adopted by the authors of these letters to characterize\r\nthe movement as a revolt of slaves against imperialism. The authorship\r\nof the letters was clearly composite and is not definitely known, but\r\nthey were popularly ascribed to Liebknecht. His style marks some of\r\nthem, but others point to Frau Luxemburg, and it is probable that at\r\nleast these two and possibly other persons collaborated in them. They\r\nopposed the war, which they termed an imperialistic war of aggression,\r\nand summoned their readers to employ all possible obstructive tactics\r\nagainst it. Revolution was not mentioned in so many words, but the\r\ntendency was naturally revolutionary.\r\n\r\nDespite all efforts of the authorities, these letters and other anti-war\r\nliterature continued to circulate secretly. In November, 1915,\r\nLiebknecht, Frau Luxemburg, Mehring and Frau Zetkin gave out a\r\nmanifesto, which was published in Switzerland, in which they declared\r\nthat their views regarding the war differed from those of the rest of\r\nthe Socialists, but could not be expressed in Germany under martial law.\r\nThe manifesto was so worded that prosecution thereon could hardly have\r\nbeen sustained. The Swiss newspapers circulated freely in Germany, and\r\nthe manifesto was not without its effect. The Socialist party saw itself\r\ncompelled on February 2, 1915, to expel Liebknecht from the party. This\r\nstep, although doubtless unavoidable, proved to be the first move toward\r\nthe eventual split in the party. There were already many Socialists who,\r\nalthough out of sympathy with the attitude of their party, had\r\nnevertheless hesitated to break with it. Many of these, including most\r\nof Liebknecht's personal followers, soon followed him voluntarily, and\r\nthe allegiance of thousands of others to the old party was seriously\r\nweakened.\r\n\r\nOutwardly, however, what was eventually to become a revolutionary\r\nmovement made no headway during the spring and summer of 1915. The\r\nshortage of food, although making itself felt, had not yet brought\r\ngeneral suffering. The German armies had won many brilliant victories\r\nand suffered no marked reverse. Mackensen's invasion of Galicia in May\r\nand June revived the spirits of the whole nation, in which, as among all\r\nother belligerent nations, a certain war-weariness had already begun to\r\nmanifest itself.\r\n\r\nThe open break in the Socialist party first became apparent at the\r\nsession of the Reichstag on December 21, 1915. The government had asked\r\nfor a further war-credit of ten billion marks. Haase had a week earlier\r\ndrawn up a manifesto against the war, but the newspapers had been\r\nforbidden to print it. At this Reichstag session he employed his\r\nparliamentary prerogatives to get this manifesto before the people in\r\nthe form of a speech attacking the war as one of aggression, and\r\nannounced that he would vote against the credit asked. Fourteen other\r\nmembers of his party voted with him. The German people's solid war-front\r\nhad been broken.\r\n\r\nThe motives of most of those who thus began the revolt against the\r\ngovernment and who were later responsible for the revolution are easy to\r\ndetermine. Many were honest fanatics, and some of these, chief among\r\nthem Liebknecht, carried their fanaticism to a degree calling for the\r\nserious consideration of alienists. Others again were moved by purely\r\nselfish considerations, and some of them had criminal records. Haase\r\npresented and still presents a riddle even for those who know him well.\r\nJudged by his speeches alone, he appears in the light of an honest\r\ninternationalist, striving to further the welfare of his own and all\r\nother peoples. Judged by his conduct, and particularly his conduct in\r\nthe months following the revolution, he appears in the light of a\r\npolitical desperado whose acts are dictated by narrow personal\r\nconsiderations. He was particularly fitted for leadership of the\r\ngovernment's opponents by the absence from his makeup of the blind\r\nfanaticism that characterized the majority of these, and by an utter\r\nunscrupulousness in his methods. He was free also from that fear of\r\ninconsistency which has been called the vice of small minds.\r\n\r\nThe questions growing out of the manner of conducting the submarine\r\nwarfare became acute in the first months of 1916. The government was\r\ndetermined to prevent any open debate on this subject in the Reichstag,\r\nand the deputies of all parties bowed to the government's will. Haase\r\nand his little group of malcontents, however, refused to submit. They\r\ncarried their opposition to the authority of their own party to such an\r\nextent that a party caucus decided upon their exclusion. The caucus vote\r\nwas followed on the same day--March 24, 1916--by the formal secession\r\nfrom the party of Haase and seventeen other members, who constituted\r\nthemselves as a separate party under the designation of \"Socialist\r\nWorking Society\" (_Arbeitsgemeinschaft_). The seceders included, among\r\nothers, Georg Ledebour, Wilhelm Dittmann, Dr. Oskar Cohn, Emil Barth,\r\nErnst Daeumig and Eduard Bernstein. Liebknecht, who had been excluded\r\nfrom the party a year earlier, allied himself to the new group. All its\r\nmembers were internationalists.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the new party furnished a rallying point for all\r\nradical Socialists and also for the discontented generally, and the\r\nnumbers of these were increasing daily. Under the protection of their\r\nparliamentary immunity these members were able to carry on a more\r\noutspoken and effective agitation against the war. Haase, Ledebour and\r\nother members of the group issued a manifesto in June, 1916, wherein it\r\nwas declared that the people were starving and that the only replies\r\nmade by the government to their protests took the form of a severe\r\napplication of martial law. \"The blockade should have been foreseen,\"\r\nsaid the manifesto. \"It is not the blockade that is a crime; the war is\r\na crime. The consolation that the harvest will be good is a deliberate\r\ndeception. All the food in the occupied territories has been\r\nrequisitioned, and people are dying of starvation in Poland and Serbia.\"\r\nThe manifesto concluded with an appeal to the men and women of the\r\nlaboring-classes to raise their voices against the continuance of the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nThe underground propaganda against the war and the government assumed\r\ngreater proportions, and encouraged the revolutionaries in the\r\nReichstag. Grown bold, Haase announced that a pacifist meeting would be\r\nheld in Berlin on August 30. It was prohibited by the police. Sporadic\r\nstrikes began. Ruehle had staged the first avowedly political strike at\r\nLeipsic on May Day. It failed, but set an example which was followed in\r\nother parts of the empire.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht, who had been mustered into the army and was hence subject to\r\nmilitary regulations, was arrested on May Day in Berlin for carrying on\r\nan anti-war and anti-government agitation among the workingmen. On trial\r\nhe was sentenced to thirty months' imprisonment and to dishonorable\r\ndismissal from the army. This was the signal for widespread strikes of\r\nprotest in various cities. There was serious rioting in Berlin on July\r\n1st, and grave disorders also occurred at Stuttgart, Leipsic and other\r\ncities. Liebknecht appealed from the conviction and the appellate court\r\nraised the sentence to four years and one month, with loss of civil\r\nrights for six years. This caused a recrudescence of July's\r\ndemonstrations, for a sentence of this severity was most unusual in\r\nGermany. Liebknecht's personal followers and party friends swore\r\nvengeance, and many others who had theretofore kept themselves apart\r\nfrom a movement with which they secretly sympathized were rendered more\r\nsusceptible to radical anti-war propaganda.\r\n\r\nThe autumn of 1916 brought the government's so-called\r\n_Hilfsdienstgesetz_, or Auxiliary Service Law, intended to apply\r\nmilitary rules of enrollment and discipline to the carrying out of\r\nnecessary work at home, such as wood-cutting, railway-building, etc.\r\nThis law produced widespread dissatisfaction, and Haase, by attacking it\r\nin the Reichstag, increased his popularity and poured more oil upon the\r\nflames of discontent. In March, 1917, he declared openly in the\r\nReichstag that Germany could not win the war and that peace must be made\r\nat once.\r\n\r\nThe Russian revolution of this month was a factor whose influence and\r\nconsequences in Germany can hardly be exaggerated. Not even the wildest\r\ndreamer had dared to believe that a revolution could be successfully\r\ncarried through in war-time while the government had millions of loyal\r\ntroops at its disposal. That it not only did succeed, but that many of\r\nthe Tsar's formerly most loyal officers, as, for example, Brussiloff,\r\nimmediately joined the revolutionaries, exerted a powerful effect. And\r\nthus, while Germans loyal to their government hailed the revolution as\r\nthe downfall of a powerful enemy, the masses, starving through this\r\nterrible _Kohlruebenwinter_, cold, miserable, dispirited by the bloody\r\nsacrifices from which few families had been exempt, infected\r\nunconsciously by the doctrines of international Socialism and skillfully\r\npropagandized by radical agitators, began to wonder whether, after all,\r\ntheir salvation did not lie along the route taken by the Russians.\r\n\r\nThe radical Socialists who had left the old party in 1916 organized as\r\nthe Independent Socialist Party of Germany at a convention held in Gotha\r\nin April, 1917. Eighteen men had left the party a year earlier, but one\r\nhundred and forty-eight delegates, including fifteen Reichstag deputies,\r\nattended the convention. Haase and Ledebour were chosen chairmen of the\r\nexecutive committee, and a plan of opposition to the further conduct of\r\nthe war was worked out. Party newspaper organs were established, and\r\nsome existing Socialist publications espoused the cause of the new\r\nparty. Revolution could naturally be no part of their open policy, and\r\nthere may have been many members of the party who did not realize what\r\nthe logical and inevitable consequences of their actions were. The\r\nleaders, however, were by this time definitely and deliberately working\r\nfor the overthrow of the government, although it may be doubted whether\r\neven they realized what would be the extent of the _debacle_ when it\r\nshould come.\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to strikes in various parts of the\r\nempire. These had been, up to 1918, chiefly due to dissatisfaction\r\nover material things--hunger (the strong undercurrent of all\r\ndissatisfaction), inadequate clothing, low wages, long hours, etc. They\r\nwere encouraged and often manipulated by radical Socialists who\r\nperceived their importance as a weapon against the government, and were\r\nto that extent political, but the first great strike with revolution as\r\nits definite aim was staged in Berlin and Essen at the end of January,\r\n1918. The strength of the Independent Socialists and of the more radical\r\nadherents of Liebknecht, Ledebour, Rosa Luxemburg and others of the same\r\nstamp, while it had increased but slowly in the rural districts and the\r\nsmall towns, had by this time reached great proportions in the capital\r\nand generally in the industrial sections of Westphalia. Two great\r\nmunition plants in Berlin employing nearly a hundred thousand workers\r\nwere almost solidly Independent Socialist in profession and Bolshevist\r\nin fact. The infection had reached the great plants in and around Essen\r\nin almost equal degree. A great part of these malcontents was made up of\r\nyouths who, in their early teens when the war broke out, had for more\r\nthan three years been released from parental restraint owing to the\r\nabsence of their soldier-fathers and who had at the same time been\r\nearning wages that were a temptation to lead a disordered life. They\r\nwere fertile ground for the seeds of propaganda whose sowing the\r\nauthorities were unable to stop, or even materially to check. Even\r\nLiebknecht, from his cell, had been able to get revolutionary\r\ncommunications sent out to his followers.\r\n\r\nThe January strike assumed large proportions, and so confident were the\r\nBerlin strikers of the strength of their position that they addressed an\r\n\"ultimatum\" to the government. This ultimatum demanded a speedy peace\r\nwithout annexations or indemnities; the participation of workingmen's\r\ndelegates of all countries in the peace negotiations; reorganization of\r\nthe food-rationing system; abolishing of the state of siege, and freedom\r\nof assembly and of the press; the release of all political prisoners;\r\nthe democratization of state institutions, and equal suffrage for women.\r\nThe strikers appointed a workmen's council to direct their campaign, and\r\nthis council chose an \"action commission,\" of which Haase was a member.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, in part unable and in part unwilling to make the\r\nconcessions demanded, took determined steps to put down the strike.\r\nTheir chief weapon was one that had been used repeatedly, and, as events\r\nproved, too often and too freely. This weapon was the so-called\r\n_Strafversetzungen_, or punitive transfers into the front-army. The\r\ngreat part of the strikers were men subject to military duty who had\r\nbeen especially reclaimed and kept at work in indispensable industries\r\nat home. They were, however, subject to military law and discipline, and\r\nthe imminent threat of being sent to the front in case of\r\ninsubordination had prevented many strikes that would otherwise have\r\ncome, and the carrying into effect of this threat had broken many\r\nrevolts in factories. Thousands of these men, who had been drawing high\r\nwages and receiving extra allowances of food, were promptly sent into\r\nthe trenches.\r\n\r\nEvery such _Strafversetzung_ was worse than a lost battle in its effect.\r\nThe victims became missionaries of revolution, filled with a burning\r\nhatred for the government that had pulled them from their comfortable\r\nbeds and safe occupations and thrown them into the hail of death and the\r\nhardships of the front. They carried the gospel of discontent, rebellion\r\nand internationalism among men who had theretofore been as sedulously\r\nguarded against such propaganda as possible. The morale of the soldiery\r\nwas for a time restored by the successes following the offensive of\r\nMarch, 1918, and it never broke entirely, even during the terrible days\r\nof the long retreat before the victorious Allied armies, but it was\r\nbadly shaken, and the wild looting that followed the armistice was\r\nchiefly due to the fellows of baser sort who were at the front because\r\nthey had been sent thither for punishment.\r\n\r\nYet another factor played an important part in increasing discontent at\r\nthe front. One can say, without fear of intelligent contradiction, that\r\nno other country ever possessed as highly trained and efficient officers\r\nas Germany at the outbreak of the war. There were martinets among them,\r\nand the discipline was at best strict, but the first article of their\r\ncreed was to look after the welfare of the men committed to their\r\ncharge. Drawn from the best families and with generations of\r\nofficer-ancestors behind them, they were inspired by both family and\r\nclass pride which forbade them to spare themselves in the service of the\r\nFatherland. The mortality in the officer-corps was enormous. About forty\r\nper cent of the original officers of career were killed, and a majority\r\nof the rest incapacitated. The result was a shortage of trained men\r\nwhich made itself severely felt in the last year of the war. Youths of\r\neighteen and nineteen, fresh from the schools and hastily trained, were\r\nmade lieutenants and placed in command of men old enough to be their\r\nfathers. The wine of authority mounted to boyish heads. Scores of\r\nelderly German soldiers have declared to the writer independently of\r\neach other that the overbearing manners, arbitrary orders and arrogance\r\nof these youths aroused the resentment of even the most loyal men and\r\nincreased inestimably the discontent already prevailing at the front.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n                         Propaganda and Morale.\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before the anti-war and revolutionary propaganda had attained great\r\nproportions there were indications that all was not well in one branch\r\nof the empire's armed forces. Rumblings of discontent began to come from\r\nthe navy early in the second year of the war, and in the summer of 1916\r\nthere was a serious outbreak of rioting at Kiel. Its gravity was not at\r\nfirst realized, because Kiel, even in peace times, had been a turbulent\r\nand riotous city. But a few months later the rioting broke out again,\r\nand in the early summer of 1917 there came a menacing strike of sailors\r\nand shipyard and dock laborers at Wilhelmshaven. This was mainly a\r\nwage-movement, coupled with a demand for more food, but it had political\r\nconsequences of a serious nature.\r\n\r\nThe first displays of mutinous spirit among the men of the fleet were\r\nnot so much due to revolutionary and radical Socialist propaganda as to\r\na spontaneous internal dissatisfaction with the conditions of the\r\nservice itself. No continuously extensive use of the submarines had been\r\nmade up to the middle of the winter of 1916. There had been spurts of\r\nactivity with this weapon, but no sustained effort. By March, 1916,\r\nhowever, many U-boats were being sent out. At first they were manned by\r\nvolunteers, and there had been a surplus of volunteers, for the men of\r\nthe submarine crews received special food, more pay, liberal furloughs\r\nand the Iron Cross after the third trip. Within a year, however,\r\nconditions changed decidedly. The percentage of U-boats lost is not yet\r\nknown, but the men of the fleet reckoned that a submarine rarely\r\nsurvived its tenth trip. The Admiralty naturally published no accounts\r\nof boats that failed to come back, and this added a new terror to this\r\nbranch of the service.\r\n\r\nVolunteers were no longer to be had. The result was that drafts were\r\nresorted to, at the first from the men of the High Seas fleet, and later\r\nfrom the land forces. Such a draft came to be considered as equivalent\r\nto a death-sentence.[16] Disaffection increased in the fleet. The\r\nIndependent Socialists were prompt to discover and take advantage of\r\nthese conditions. The sailors were plied with propaganda, oral and\r\nwritten. The character of this propaganda was not generally known until\r\nOctober 9, 1917, when the Minister of Marine, Admiral von Capelle,\r\nspeaking in the Reichstag, informed the astonished nation that a serious\r\nmutiny had occurred in the fleet two months earlier, and that it had\r\nbeen necessary to execute some of the ringleaders and imprison a number\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n[16]  The heavy losses among army aviators had brought about a\r\n    similar state of affairs at this time in the army. Volunteers\r\n    for the fighting planes ceased offering themselves, and a\r\n    resort to forced service became necessary.\r\n\r\nVon Capelle's disclosures came as answer to an interpellation by the\r\nIndependent Socialist deputies regarding pan-German propaganda at the\r\nfront and the prohibition of the circulation of twenty-three Socialist\r\nnewspapers among the men of the ships. The Independent Wilhelm Dittmann\r\nmade a long speech supporting the interpellation, and voiced a bitter\r\ncomplaint over the fact that pan-German agitation was permitted at the\r\nfront and among the fleet, while the Independent Socialist propaganda\r\nwas forbidden. Dr. Michaelis, the Imperial Chancellor, made a brief\r\nresponse, in which he announced that Admiral von Capelle would answer\r\nthe Independents. \"I will merely say one thing,\" he said, \"and that is\r\nthat Deputy Dittmann is the last man in the world who has a right to\r\ntalk about agitation in the army and navy.\"\r\n\r\nMichaelis referred then to a complaint by Dittmann that he (Michaelis)\r\nhad not been true to his promise, made upon assuming office, to treat\r\nall parties alike. \"Dittmann has forgotten to add the qualification\r\nwhich I made at that time,\" said the Chancellor. \"I said all parties\r\nthat do not threaten the existence of the empire or follow aims\r\ndangerous to the state. The party of the Independent Social-Democrats\r\nstands on the other side of that line so far as I am concerned.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first open declaration by the government of war on the\r\nparty of Haase, Dittmann, et al. The Majority Socialists--as the members\r\nof the old or parent organization were now termed--joined in the tumult\r\nraised by their seceding brethren. When the storm had laid itself,\r\nAdmiral von Capelle made his sensational disclosures. He said:\r\n\r\n    \"It is unfortunately a fact that the Russian revolution has\r\n    turned the heads of a few persons on board our fleet and caused\r\n    them to entertain matured revolutionary ideas. The mad plan of\r\n    these few men was to secure accomplices on all ships and to\r\n    subvert the whole fleet, all members of the crews, to open\r\n    mutiny, in order, by force if necessary, to paralyze the fleet\r\n    and compel peace.\r\n\r\n    \"It is a fact that these men have entered into relations with\r\n    the Independent Socialist Party. It has been formally\r\n    established by the evidence that the ringleader presented his\r\n    plans to Deputies Dittmann, Haase and Vogtherr in the\r\n    caucus-room of the Independent Socialists here in the Reichstag\r\n    building, and that it received the approval of these men.\r\n\r\n    \"It is true that these deputies pointed out the extreme danger\r\n    of the proposed action and warned the conspirators to observe\r\n    the greatest caution, but they promised their whole-hearted\r\n    support through the furnishing of agitation material designed to\r\n    incite the fleet to mutiny.\"\r\n\r\nVon Capelle's speech was interrupted at this point by cries of\r\nindignation from the parties of the right and center, and by abusive\r\nremarks directed against the speaker from the Socialists of both\r\nfactions. When the presiding-officer had succeeded in restoring a\r\nsemblance of order, the Admiral continued:\r\n\r\n    \"In view of this situation it was my first duty to prevent with\r\n    all possible means at my disposal the circulation of the\r\n    incitatory literature among the fleet.\r\n\r\n    \"I do not care at this time to go into details concerning the\r\n    further happenings in the fleet. Some few men who had forgotten\r\n    honor and duty committed grave crimes and have undergone the\r\n    punishment which they deserved. I will only add here that the\r\n    rumors in circulation, which have naturally come also to my\r\n    ears, are exaggerated beyond all measure. The preparedness of\r\n    the fleet for battle has not been brought in question for a\r\n    single moment, and it shall and will not be.\"\r\n\r\nThe three deputies named by von Capelle defended themselves in speeches\r\nwhich, judged even on their merits and without reference to the\r\npersonalities and records of the men making them, did not ring quite\r\ntrue or carry complete conviction. In the light of the previous and\r\nsubsequent conduct of the trio and of the occurrences of November, 1918,\r\ntheir shifty and evasive character is apparent. We have already learned\r\nsomething of Haase's activities, and the other two were among his ablest\r\nand most energetic lieutenants. Dittmann, virtually a Communist and\r\npronounced internationalist, was later arrested for pro-revolutionary\r\nactivities. Erwin Vogtherr, the third member of the group, had from the\r\nvery beginning been one of the most perniciously active of all\r\nrevolutionary propagandists and agitators. He had been for some time the\r\neditor of _Der Atheist_ (The Atheist), and was of that uncompromising\r\ntype of atheists who consider it necessary to keep their hats on in\r\nchurch to show their disbelief in a Creator.\r\n\r\nHaase, in his reply to the charges against him, admitted that the\r\nmutineers' ringleader had had a conference with him, Dittmann and\r\nVogtherr. But this, he declared, was nothing out of the ordinary, since\r\nit was both his custom and his duty to receive the men who came to him\r\nfrom both army and navy to complain of conditions. The sailor referred\r\nto by Admiral von Capelle had visited him during the summer and\r\ncomplained bitterly about the conditions which he and his colleagues\r\nwere compelled to endure. Haase continued:\r\n\r\n    \"He declared further that the sailors, and especially those of\r\n    lengthy service, felt keenly the lack of mental stimulus, that\r\n    great numbers of them had subscribed to Independent Socialist\r\n    publications, were reading them zealously and receiving stimulus\r\n    from them. It was their intention to educate themselves further\r\n    and to devote themselves to political discussions in meetings on\r\n    land. To this end they desired to have literature. Although, as\r\n    has been shown in the last days, political discussions have been\r\n    carried on under full steam, even officially, I called this\r\n    sailor's attention to the fact that what was in itself\r\n    permissible, might, under the peculiar conditions under which we\r\n    lived, become dangerous, and I warned him to be cautious. This\r\n    much is correct.\"\r\n\r\nHaase denied that the sailor had submitted any revolutionary plan to him\r\nor his colleagues, and challenged Admiral von Capelle to produce his\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for one who, like the writer, has a thorough\r\nacquaintance with the Independent Socialist publications, to take\r\nseriously the statement that they were desired merely for \"mental\r\nstimulus\" by sailors who wished to \"educate themselves further.\" The\r\nplain tendency of all these publications, disguised as cleverly as it\r\nmight be in an attempt to escape confiscation of the issue or\r\nprosecution for treason, was revolutionary. A certain degree of\r\nvenomousness, scurrility and abuse of _bourgeois_ opponents has always\r\ncharacterized all but a few Socialist publications in all lands, and the\r\nIndependent Socialist press far outdid the organs of the old party in\r\nthis respect. It preached internationalism and flouted patriotism; it\r\nridiculed all existing authority; it glorified the Russian revolution in\r\na manner calculated to induce imitation by its readers, and, following\r\nthe Bolshevik revolution in Russia in November, 1917, it published\r\nregularly the reports of the _Isvestia_ and other Bolshevik organs, with\r\nlaudatory editorial comment. The man who \"educated himself further\" by a\r\nreading of the Independent Socialist publications was educating himself\r\nfor revolution and for nothing else.\r\n\r\nVogtherr set up a straw man in his reply and demolished it to the\r\ncomplete satisfaction of himself and his brother Socialists, including,\r\nstrangely enough, also the Majority Socialists, who, despite the fact\r\nthat the Independent Socialist press had classified them with\r\n_bourgeoisie_ and attacked them even more bitterly, on this occasion\r\nexhibited solidarity of feeling with their more radical colleagues.\r\nVogtherr declared that von Capelle had charged the Independents with\r\nhaving worked out a plan for revolution in the fleet. This alleged\r\ncharge he denied. He spoke with a certain pathos of the oppressed\r\nsailors who recognized in the Independents their real friends and\r\nnaturally came to them instead of going to deputies in whom they had no\r\nconfidence. He, too, demanded that the Minister of Marine produce his\r\nproof. Vogtherr, like Haase before him, devoted a part of his speech to\r\na general attack on von Capelle and Michaelis, plainly the attempt of a\r\npractical politician to confuse the issue.\r\n\r\nDittmann spoke briefly along the lines followed by Haase and Vogtherr.\r\nHe had, he said, carefully warned his sailor-visitors to keep within\r\nsafe bounds. He refused to permit either Admiral von Capelle or\r\nChancellor Michaelis to restrict his rights as Reichstag deputy to\r\nreceive visitors and hear their complaints. Dittmann cleverly enlisted\r\nfurther the sympathy of the Majority Socialists by pointing out that\r\nseveral of their publications had also come under the ban of the\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\nVon Capelle responded to the challenge of the trio to produce his\r\nevidence. He read the following testimony, given at the court-martial by\r\none of the lieutenants of the mutineers' ringleader, a man named Sachse.\r\nThis witness testified:\r\n\r\n    \"I, too, made a personal visit to Deputy Dittmann in the\r\n    Reichstag after Reichpietsch (the ringleader) had visited him. I\r\n    introduced myself by saying that I came from Reichpietsch and\r\n    that I came in the same matter. Dittmann indicated that he knew\r\n    what I meant. He was glad to see me and said: 'We must go ahead\r\n    in the same way, but we must use great caution.'\r\n\r\n    \"Regarding his conference with the members of the party\r\n    Reichpietsch told me the following: He had not been with\r\n    Dittmann alone, but there had been a kind of a party conference,\r\n    participated in by Dittmann, Vogtherr and Haase. Reichpietsch\r\n    communicated to them the plan and the results thus far attained\r\n    by the organization, which, according to his declaration, was\r\n    very enthusiastic about the matter.\r\n\r\n    \"After discussion of the details of the organization, the\r\n    deputies told Reichpietsch that this was a prohibited and\r\n    punishable undertaking and a very daring one, and he must be\r\n    very careful. So far as they were concerned, they would support\r\n    his agitation in every manner, and especially through pamphlets\r\n    and other literature.\"\r\n\r\nAdmiral von Capelle further read from the testimony of the ringleader,\r\nReichpietsch, who, after reading Sachse's testimony, had said under\r\noath:\r\n\r\n    \"Insofar as this testimony concerns me it is correct. That is to\r\n    say, what I told Sachse was a true report of what had happened\r\n    in Berlin.\"\r\n\r\nFriedrich (Fritz) Ebert, the Majority Socialist leader who later became\r\nthe first president of the German Republic, defended the Independent\r\nSocialists and declared that the government had offered no evidence to\r\nsubstantiate its accusations against Haase, Dittmann and Vogtherr.\r\nDeputy Naumann of the Progressive party also defended them indirectly,\r\nand both he and Deputy Trimborn of the Center (Clerical party) protested\r\nagainst any effort to place a Reichstag party outside the pale.\r\n\r\nIn view of the revolutionary activities of the Independent Socialists\r\neven before that date and of the occurrences of the succeeding year,\r\nwhich culminated in the overthrow of the government, this attitude of\r\nsupposedly loyal and patriotic parties of the Reichstag appears at first\r\nsight astonishing and almost inexplicable. There were, however, two\r\nreasons (in the case of the Majority Socialists three reasons) for it.\r\nNeither the _bourgeois_ parties nor the Majority Socialists had any\r\nconception of the extent of the revolutionary propaganda being carried\r\non by the Independents and their more radical accomplices. As we shall\r\nsee later, even the old party Socialists were completely taken by\r\nsurprise when the actual revolution came, and revolution was almost an\r\naccomplished fact in Berlin, six days after it had begun in Kiel, before\r\nthey awakened to what was happening. Hence the accusations against their\r\ncolleagues of another party appeared to the three parties of the\r\nanti-annexationist wing of the Reichstag as a blow directed against all\r\nopponents of the pan-German program of the parties of the Right.\r\n\r\nThe second reason was psychological and to be found in the atmosphere of\r\nthe day's session. It had started, as already reported, with the\r\ndiscussion of an interpellation regarding pan-German propaganda at the\r\nfront and in the fleet. The anti-Chauvinist majority of the Reichstag\r\nhad earlier found its way together in a _bloc_ composed of the\r\nProgressives, Clericals and Majority Socialists, and had adopted, on\r\nJuly 19, 1917, a resolution, in the main the work of Mathias Erzberger\r\nof the Clericals, calling for a peace without annexations or\r\nindemnities, and reserving the right of self-determination to all\r\nnations. Equally with the Independent Socialists, this _bloc_ had been\r\nstirred to indignation by the shameless manner in which the high civil\r\nand military authorities not only permitted the advocates of an\r\nimperialistic and annexationist peace to carry on their propaganda among\r\nthe soldiers and sailors, but even encouraged and actively assisted in\r\nthat work. Not only all Socialist publications, but even many\r\n_bourgeois_ papers of the stamp of the Berlin _Tageblatt_ were\r\nabsolutely forbidden by the commanders of many troop units, and the\r\nsoldiers were compelled to listen to speeches by members of the\r\npan-German _Vaterlandspartei_ (Fatherland Party) and similar\r\norganizations. Ignorant of the extent and nature of the Independent\r\nSocialists' efforts to undermine authority, the _bloc_ parties saw in\r\nAdmiral von Capelle's charges only another manifestation of the spirit\r\nagainst which their own fight was directed. That, in these\r\ncircumstances, they should defend the Independents was but natural.\r\n\r\nThe third reason affecting the course of the Majority Socialists has\r\nalready been referred to in passing. This was the feeling of party\r\nsolidarity, which still existed despite the fact that the Independents\r\nhad had their own party organization for some six months. Most of the\r\nprominent men in both Socialist parties had worked together in a common\r\ncause for many years, and while, in the heat of purely partisan\r\nconflicts this was sometimes forgotten for the moment, it nevertheless\r\nunited the two factions when, as now, the attack came from the extreme\r\nRight.\r\n\r\nComplete details of the mutiny of this summer have never been given out.\r\nAccording to the best reports available, it started on the battleship\r\n_Westfalen_ at Wilhelmshaven and included altogether four vessels, one\r\nof which was the _Nuernberg_. The captain of the _Nuernberg_ is said to\r\nhave been thrown overboard. Rumor and enemy report made the most of the\r\naffair and undoubtedly exaggerated it greatly, but there can be no doubt\r\nthat it was serious and that the morale of the fleet was greatly\r\naffected by it. Some of the ring-leaders--how many it is not known--were\r\nexecuted, and a considerable number were imprisoned for long terms. The\r\nextent and severity of the sentences added fuel to the discontent\r\nalready prevailing throughout the fleet. The men's fighting spirit sank\r\nas their revolutionary spirit rose. Von Capelle's boast that the fleet's\r\npreparedness for battle \"shall and will not be brought in question for a\r\nmoment\" was a vain boast. The fleet was already rotten at the core.\r\n\r\nIronic fate had led the men who directed the affairs of the German\r\nEmpire to forge one of the weapons with which it was later to be\r\ndestroyed. On April 9, 1917, Nicholas Lenine, with thirty-two fanatical\r\nfollowers, had been brought from Switzerland through Germany in a sealed\r\ncar and sent into Russia to sow the seeds of Bolshevism. How the plan\r\nsucceeded is only too well known. November brought the overthrow of the\r\nKerensky government. Released from the necessity of the intensive\r\npre-revolutionary propaganda at home, the Bolsheviki turned their\r\nattention to imperialistic Germany. Their missionaries, liberally\r\nequipped with corruption funds, entered Germany by secret routes and\r\nworked with Germans in sympathy with their cause, notably Liebknecht.\r\nForemost among their propagandists was a man who called himself Radek.\r\nHis real name was Sobelsohn, a Jew from Austrian Galicia. Expelled from\r\nhis labor union before the war for robbing a _Genosse_, he had settled\r\nin Bremen and was even then the guiding spirit in the most radical and\r\nrabid circles. After the Russian Bolshevik revolution he quickly took up\r\nthe severed threads of his former connections. He was intimate with all\r\nthe Independent Socialist leaders already named, and with many others. A\r\nman of acknowledged organizing and propagandizing ability, he\r\ncontributed markedly to making Germany ripe for revolution.\r\n\r\nAll the gates were thrown down to Bolshevism following the treaty of\r\nBrest-Litovsk, when Joffe, the Bolshevik Ambassador, was permitted to\r\ncome to Berlin and establish himself in the palace of the former\r\nImperial Russian Embassy in _Unter den Linden_. He brought a staff of\r\nmen and women whose sole duty it was to carry on Bolshevist propaganda\r\nagainst the government to which he was accredited. Leading Independent\r\nSocialists were frequent visitors at the embassy, and Haase, at an\r\nelaborate banquet held there in May, 1918, responded to the toast, \"The\r\nRed International.\"\r\n\r\nClosest to Joffe of all Germans was Dr. Oskar Cohn, one of the founders\r\nof the Independent Socialist Party. Cohn, who is a Berlin lawyer,\r\npossesses that curious combination of characteristics so often\r\nencountered in extreme Socialism. In his private life of undoubted\r\nprobity, he rejoiced at an opportunity to accept and distribute money\r\ngiven by a foreign government to overthrow the government of his own\r\nFatherland. Mild-mannered and an opponent of force, he made the cause of\r\nLiebknecht's murderous Spartacans his own. Scholarly and of deep\r\nlearning, he associated freely with the dregs of the population, with\r\nthieves and murderers, in furtherance of the cause of the international\r\nproletariat. He became the legal adviser of Joffe and one of the main\r\ndistributors of the Bolsheviki's corruption fund.\r\n\r\nThe political police were at all times cognizant of the revolutionary\r\npropaganda that was being carried on, but they were greatly hampered in\r\ntheir work by a limitation which had been imposed in 1917 upon the\r\nso-called _Schutzhaft_, literally \"protective arrest.\" This had been\r\nfreely used against suspected persons from the beginning of the war, and\r\nhundreds had sat in jail for weeks in what was equivalent to a sentence\r\nof imprisonment, without having had an opportunity to hear what the\r\ncharge against them was. The abuse of this right became so glaring that\r\nit was provided in 1917 that arrested persons could not be detained\r\nwithout a definite crime being charged against them. The police made a\r\nlong report on Joffe's activities in June, 1918, and the authorities,\r\nwith some hesitation, placed the matter before the \"Ambassador.\" He lied\r\nbravely, declaring that he cherished no plans against the integrity of\r\nthe German Empire and that his large staff existed solely to carry on\r\nthe legitimate business of the embassy.\r\n\r\nThe authorities, unconvinced, maintained a watch on the activities of\r\nthe Russians. They were particularly suspicious of the unusual number of\r\ndiplomatic couriers passing between Berlin and Petrograd. Their number\r\nwas said to reach nearly four hundred. The press began to voice these\r\nsuspicions. Joffe, with a fine show of indignation, declared that it\r\n\"was beneath his dignity\" to take any notice of them. The tenuity of\r\nHerr Joffe's dignity and the value of his word became apparent on\r\nNovember 5, 1918, in the revolution week, when a box in the luggage of a\r\ncourier arriving from Russia was--\"accidentally,\" as the official report\r\nput it--broken open at the railway station. Its contents proved to be\r\nBolshevik propaganda literature inciting the Germans to institute a\r\nreign of terror against the _bourgeoisie_, to murder the oppressors of\r\nthe proletariat and to overthrow the government. One of these appeals\r\ncame from the Spartacan _Internationale_ and contained a carefully\r\nworked-out program for instituting a reign of terror.\r\n\r\nEven the _Vorwaerts_, which had been reluctant to credit the charges\r\nagainst _Genosse_ Joffe, was now compelled to admit that he had lied and\r\nmisused his diplomatic privileges. Joffe, still denying his guilt, was\r\nescorted from the embassy in the middle of the following night by an\r\narmed guard and placed aboard a special train for Moscow, with the whole\r\nstaff of the embassy and of the Rosta Telegraph Agency, ostensibly a\r\nnews agency, but really an institution for carrying on Bolshevik\r\npropaganda. Once safe in Russia, Joffe admitted his activities in\r\nGermany and gloried in them. In a wireless message sent on December 8,\r\n1918, he said the Bolshevik literature had been circulated \"through the\r\ngood offices of the Independent Socialists.\" He declared further that a\r\nmuch greater number of weapons than had been alleged had been handed\r\nover to the Independent Barth, together with \"several hundred thousand\r\nroubles.\" He added:\r\n\r\n    \"I claim for myself the honor of having devoted all my powers to\r\n    the success of the German revolution through my activities,\r\n    which were carried on in agreement with the Independent\r\n    Socialist ministers Haase and Barth and with others.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the publication of this wireless message, Cohn also issued an\r\nexplanation of his activities in connection with Joffe. He said:\r\n\r\n    \"Is any particular explanation or justification needed to make\r\n    it clear that I gladly accepted the funds which the Russian\r\n    comrades sent me by the hand of Comrade Joffe for the purposes\r\n    of the German revolution? Comrade Joffe gave me the money in the\r\n    night of November 5th. This had nothing to do with the money\r\n    which he had previously given me for the purchase of weapons. I\r\n    used the money for the purpose intended, namely, the spreading\r\n    of the revolutionary idea, and regret only that circumstances\r\n    made it impossible for me to use all of it in this manner.\"\r\n\r\nBolshevik centers had been organized all over Germany when the\r\nrevolution came. On the same day Joffe was expelled, the police in\r\nDuesseldorf closed a Bolshevik nest which was ostensibly conducted as a\r\nnews agency. It was but one of scores of similar centers of revolution.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary propaganda being carried on inside the empire was\r\npowerfully aided and supplemented by the activities of Germany's enemies\r\nalong the same lines. No detailed report of the extent of this branch of\r\nwarfare is yet available, but it was, in the words of one of Germany's\r\nleading generals in a talk with the writer, \"devilishly clever and\r\neffective.\" From the air, through secret channels, through traitors at\r\nhome, the German soldier or sailor was worked upon. He was told truths\r\nabout the forces against him that had been suppressed by the German\r\ncensors. The folly of longer trying to oppose the whole world was\r\npointed out, and every possible weakness in the German character was\r\ncunningly exploited. The good effect of this propaganda cannot be\r\ndoubted.\r\n\r\nTestimony regarding the part played by enemy propaganda in bringing\r\nabout the final collapse of Germany has been given by one of the men\r\nbest qualified to know the facts. In an article in _Everybody's\r\nMagazine_ for February, 1919, George Creel, chairman of the American\r\nCommittee on Public Information, gives full credit to the work of the\r\nAmerican soldiers, but declares that, in the last analysis, Germany was\r\ndefeated by publicity. The military collapse of Germany was due to \"a\r\ndisintegration of morale both on the firing line and among the civilian\r\npopulation.\" It was the telling of the truth to the Germans by their\r\nenemies that finally caused the _debacle_ at a time when the German Army\r\n\"was well equipped with supplies and ammunitions, and behind it still\r\nstretched line after line almost impregnable by reason of natural\r\nstrength and military science.\"[17]\r\n\r\n[17] German assertions that their armies were never defeated in a\r\n    military sense regularly arouse and will long continue to\r\n    arouse anger and scornful indignation among their enemies,\r\n    yet here we have official testimony to support their\r\n    contentions. It is no detraction from the valor and military\r\n    successes of the Allies to assert again that if the German\r\n    troops had not been weakened physically by starvation and\r\n    morally by enemy propaganda, they could have carried on the\r\n    war for many months more.\r\n\r\nThe propaganda literature was prepared by historians, journalists and\r\nadvertising specialists, and even some psychologists were enlisted to\r\nhelp in its writing. Germany's borders, however, were so carefully\r\nguarded that it was difficult to get the matter into the country. Mr.\r\nCreel relates interestingly how this was done. Aeroplanes were employed\r\nto some extent, but these were so badly needed for fighting purposes\r\nthat not enough could be obtained for distribution of propaganda\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\"The French introduced a rifle-grenade that carried pamphlets about six\r\nhundred feet in a favoring wind, and a seventy-five millimeter shell\r\nthat carried four or five miles. The British developed a six-inch gun\r\nthat carried ten or twelve miles and scattered several thousand leaflets\r\nfrom each shell. The Italians used rockets for close work on the front,\r\neach rocket carrying forty or fifty leaflets. The obvious smash at\r\nGerman morale was through America's aim and swift war-progress, and for\r\nthis reason the Allies used the President's speeches and our military\r\nfacts freely and sometimes exclusively.\r\n\r\n\"To reach further behind the lines, all fronts used paper balloons\r\nfilled with coal-gas. They would remain in the air a minimum of twenty\r\nhours, so as to make a trip of six hundred miles in a thirty-mile wind.\r\nOn a Belgian fete-day such balloons carried four hundred thousand\r\ngreetings into Belgium, and some flew clear across Belgium. Fabric\r\nballoons, carrying seventeen or eighteen pounds of leaflets, were also\r\nemployed, but with all the balloons the uncertainty of the wind made the\r\nwork haphazard.\r\n\r\n\"The attempt was made to fly kites over the trenches and drop leaflets\r\nfrom traveling containers that were run up the kite-wire, but this\r\nmethod could be used only on fronts where aeroplanes were not active,\r\nbecause the wires were a menace to the planes. The paper used in the\r\nleaflets was chemically treated so that they would not spoil if they lay\r\nout in the rain.\r\n\r\n\"An American invention that gave promise of supplanting all others was a\r\nballoon that carried a tin container holding about ten thousand\r\npamphlets. A clock attachment governed the climb of the balloon, it had\r\na sailing range of from six to eight hundred miles, and the mechanism\r\ncould be set in such a manner as to have the pamphlets dropped in a\r\nbunch or one at a time at regular intervals, the whole business blowing\r\nup conclusively with the descent of the last printed 'bullet'.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar methods were used against Austria-Hungary, writes Mr. Creel, and\r\ndid much to shatter their feelings of allegiance to Germany. A proof of\r\nthe effectiveness of the propaganda came when an order from the German\r\nGeneral Staff was found, \"establishing death as a penalty for all those\r\nseen picking up our matter or found with it in their possession.\r\nAustria-Hungary had earlier given orders to shoot or imprison all\r\nsoldiers or citizens guilty of the abominable crime of reading 'printed\r\nlies' against the government.\"\r\n\r\nIndirectly, too, the Germans were subjected to Allied propaganda\r\nthroughout the war. In one matter the German Government's attitude was\r\nmore democratic and ethically defensible than the attitude of its\r\nenemies. It is discouraging to the abstract moralist to find that this\r\nworked out to the detriment of those adopting the more admirable course.\r\nOf all belligerent countries, Germany was the only one that permitted\r\nthe free circulation and sale within its borders of the enemy press.\r\nLeading French and English editors were able with much difficulty to\r\nsecure copies of some German papers, and occasionally the large press\r\nassociations and some of the leading newspapers in America were\r\npermitted to see a few ancient copies, but nowhere could they be had by\r\nthe private citizen, nor even read with safety in public places by those\r\nentitled to have them. There was never a time in Berlin, from the first\r\ndeclaration of war to the armistice, when the leading American, French,\r\nEnglish, Italian and Russian papers could not be bought openly at a\r\ndozen newsstands or hotels, and the same was true generally throughout\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe well-disciplined Germans at first rejected as lies all reports in\r\nthese papers differing from the official German versions of the same\r\nhappenings. Many kept this attitude to the last, but even these began\r\nafter a while, in common with the less sturdy believers, to be morally\r\nshaken by the cumulative evidence of the worldwide unpopularity of the\r\nGermans and to be dismayed by the tone of the enemy toward everything\r\nthat they had heretofore held holy. The average German stoically endured\r\nfor a long time to be called \"Hun,\" but, in homely phrase, it got on his\r\nnerves after a while. The wild atrocity stories also played their part.\r\nAll intelligent readers of history know that tremendous exaggerations of\r\nsuch reports have always accompanied all wars. Before the present war\r\nthe Associated Press, the world's greatest newsgathering agency, barred\r\nwar-atrocity stories from its reports because experience had\r\ndemonstrated that these were often--perhaps generally--untrue and almost\r\nalways exaggerated. When the enemy press converted the German army's\r\n_Kadaververwertungs-Anstalt_ (Carcass Utilization Factory) into a Corpse\r\nUtilization Factory (_Leichenverwertungs-Anstalt_) and declared that\r\nbodies of fallen German soldiers were being rendered out for the fat,\r\nthe Germans were at first indignant and angry. This feeling changed to\r\none of consternation and eventual depression when they learned from the\r\nenemy newspapers that the story was universally believed. In the course\r\nof the long war, the constant repetition of atrocity reports, both true\r\nand false, had a cumulative depressive effect which seriously shook the\r\nmorale of all but the sturdiest of the people and was one of the factors\r\ninducing the general feeling of hopelessness that made the final\r\n_debacle_ so complete. That everybody knew some of the reports to be\r\ntrue was an aggravation of their effect. A great part, perhaps, indeed,\r\nthe greater part of all Germans condemned bitterly the Belgian\r\ndeportations, just as the best minds of the nation condemned the new\r\n_Schrecklichkeit_ of the U-boat warfare, but they were helpless so long\r\nas their government was under the iron thumb of the military caste, and\r\ntheir helplessness increased their despair when they saw the opinion of\r\nthe world embittered against their nation.\r\n\r\nThere is plenty of German testimony to show how effective this enemy\r\npropaganda was. Siegfried Heckscher, Reichstag member and chief of the\r\npublicity department of the Hamburg-America Line, writing at the end of\r\nSeptember, pointed out the need of a German propaganda ministry to\r\ncounteract the attacks being made on Germany by the propaganda work\r\nunder the direction of Lord Northcliffe.\r\n\r\n\"The German practice of silence in the face of all the pronouncements of\r\nenemy statesmen cannot be borne any longer,\" said Herr Heckscher.\r\n\"Anybody who watches the effect of the Northcliffe propaganda in foreign\r\ncountries and in Germany can have only one opinion--that this silence is\r\nequivalent to a failure of German statesmanship.\r\n\r\n\"With masterly skill every single speech of the English leaders is\r\nadapted not only to its effect in England, but also to its influence on\r\npublic opinion among the neutrals and also, and especially, in Germany.\r\n* * * * Hundreds of thousands of Germans, reading a pronouncement by the\r\nPresident of the United States, ask themselves bitterly what the German\r\nGovernment will say. Thus there is formed a cloud of discontent and dark\r\ndoubt, which, thanks to this Northcliffe propaganda, spreads itself more\r\nand more over the German people. * * * *\r\n\r\n\"We try to protect our country from enemy espionage and from the work of\r\nagents and scoundrels, but with open eyes we leave it defenseless while\r\na stream of poisonous speeches is poured over its people.\r\n\r\n\"It will not, of course, do for enemy pronouncements of importance to be\r\nwithheld from our people, but it is as necessary for our people as their\r\ndaily bread that the Anglo-Franco-American influence should be met by\r\nthe German view, and that the justice and greatness of the German cause\r\nand of the German idea should be brought into the clear, full light of\r\nday. Nor is defense sufficient. We must also aggressively champion our\r\ncause in the forum of the civilized world.\r\n\r\n\"I repeat what I have said for years, that Reuter and the English news\r\npropaganda are mightier than the English fleet and more dangerous than\r\nthe English army.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Koelnische Volkszeitung_ echoed the demand for a propaganda\r\nministry. It wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"As our good name has been stolen from us and made despicable\r\n    throughout the world, one of our peace demands must be that our\r\n    enemies publicly and officially confess that they have\r\n    circulated nothing but lies and slanders. * * * The greatest\r\n    need of the moment is a campaign of enlightenment, organized by\r\n    all the competent authorities, to hammer into German heads that,\r\n    if further sacrifices and efforts are required of us, it is not\r\n    the caprice of a few dozen people in Germany nor German\r\n    obstinacy, but the enemy's impulse to destroy, that imposes them\r\n    on people at home and at the front.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n                     Germany Requests an Armistice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Michaelis, unequal to his task, laid down the Imperial\r\nChancellorship. His successor was Count Hertling, Minister-President of\r\nBavaria. The decision to appoint this man Imperial Chancellor may have\r\nbeen influenced largely by a desire to strengthen the bonds between\r\nPrussia and the next largest German state. It is possible also that\r\nHertling's intimate relations with the Papal Court were taken into\r\nconsideration, but the choice was a striking commentary on the dearth of\r\ngood chancellorship material in Germany. Count Hertling's age alone\r\nunfitted him to bear the terrible burdens of this post, for he was well\r\nalong in the seventies, and not strong physically. He had distinguished\r\nhimself as an educator and as a writer on certain topics, especially\r\nRoman Catholic Church history, and had a record of honorable and\r\nfaithful service as a member of the Bavarian Government. In his role as\r\nstatesman he had exhibited perhaps a little more than average ability,\r\nbut never those qualities which the responsible head of a great state\r\nshould possess.\r\n\r\nA monarchist by birth and conviction, Count Hertling was particularly\r\nunfitted for the chancellorship at a time when the nation-wide demand\r\nfor democratic reforms of government was increasing in strength every\r\nmoment. In assuming his post he declared that he was fully cognizant of\r\nthe strength and justice of the demand for an increased share of\r\nparticipation by the people in the government, and he pledged himself to\r\nuse his best efforts to see that this demand was met. There is no reason\r\nto doubt the honesty of his intentions, but it was too much to expect\r\nthat an aged Conservative of the old school should so easily shake off\r\nold notions or even realize adequately what the great mass of the people\r\nmeant when they cried out for a change of system. Probably no man could\r\nhave carried out the task confronting the Chancellor; that Count\r\nHertling would fail was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe empire was honeycombed with sedition when the military reverses of\r\nthe summer began. These reverses, disastrous enough in themselves, were\r\ngreatly magnified by faint-hearted or malicious rumor. The military\r\ncommander in the Marches (Brandenburg) issued a decree on September 9th\r\nproviding for a year's imprisonment or a fine of 1,500 marks for persons\r\nspreading false rumors. The decree applied not only to rumors of\r\ndefeats, but also to reports exaggerating the enemy's strength, casting\r\ndoubts on the ability of the German armies to withstand the attack or\r\nbringing in question the soundness of the empire's economic situation.\r\n\r\nReports of serious dissensions in Austria-Hungary came at the same time\r\nto add to the general depression. The Vienna _Arbeiterzeitung_ said:\r\n\r\n    \"In questions regarding food we are compelled to negotiate with\r\n    Hungary as if we were negotiating with a foreign power. The\r\n    harvest is the best since the war began, but the Hungarians are\r\n    ruthlessly starving the Austrians, although there is plenty for\r\n    us all.\"\r\n\r\nThe Austro-Hungarian Government saw the trend of events. Premier Baron\r\nBurian told Berlin that the Dual Monarchy could not keep up the struggle\r\nmuch longer. The people, he said, were starving, and disloyalty and\r\ntreachery on the part of subject non-German races in Hungary, Bohemia\r\nand the Slav population had attained alarming proportions.\r\n\r\n\"If the rulers do not make peace the people will make it over their\r\nheads,\" said the Premier, \"and that will be the end of rulers.\"\r\n\r\nHe appealed to Germany to join with Austria-Hungary in making an offer\r\nof peace. Berlin counseled against such a step. The German Government\r\nhad long lost any illusions it might have cherished in respect to\r\nAustria-Hungary's value as an ally, and it was fully informed of the\r\ndesperateness of the situation there. Despite this it realized that such\r\na step as Vienna proposed would be taken by the enemy as a confession of\r\nweakness, and it clung desperately to the hope that the situation on the\r\nwest front might still be saved.\r\n\r\nBurian, however, cherished no illusions. Austria asked for peace, but\r\nmade it clear that she did not mean a separate peace. The German people\r\nsaw in Vienna's action the shadow of coming events, and their\r\ndespondency was increased.\r\n\r\nPrince Lichnowsky, Germany's Ambassador at the Court of St. James at the\r\nout-break of the war, had earlier confided to a few personal friends\r\ncopies of his memoirs regarding the events leading up to the war.\r\nCaptain von Beerfelde of the German General Staff, into whose hands a\r\ncopy came, had a number of copies made and circulated them generally.\r\nThe memoirs were a frank disclosure of Germany's great share of the\r\nguilt for the war. The authorities tried to stop their circulation, but\r\nthey were read by hundreds of thousands, and did much to destroy general\r\nconfidence in the justice of Germany's cause.\r\n\r\nCount Hertling, trying blunderingly to redeem his democratic promises,\r\nmade a tactlessly naive speech in the Prussian House of Lords in favor\r\nof the government's franchise-reform measures. These bills, although\r\nrepresenting a decided improvement of the existing system, had been\r\nbitterly criticized by all liberal elements because they did not go far\r\nenough, but had finally been reluctantly accepted as the best that could\r\nbe hoped for in the circumstances. A majority existed for them in the\r\nPrussian Diet, but the Junkers and noble industrialists of the House of\r\nLords would hear of no surrender of their ancient rights and privileges.\r\nThe Chancellor in his speech warned the Lords that they could avoid the\r\nnecessity of making still more far-reaching concessions later by\r\nadopting the government's measures as they stood. To reject them, he\r\ndeclared, would be seriously to imperil the crown and dynasty. He closed\r\nwith an appeal to his hearers to remember the services rendered to the\r\nFatherland by men of all political creeds, including the Socialists.\r\n\r\nCount Hertling's speech displeased everybody. The Conservative press\r\nassailed him bitterly. The _Deutsche Tageszeitung_, chief organ of the\r\nJunkers, called him \"the gravedigger of the Prussian monarchy.\" The\r\n_Kreuzzeitung_ charged him with minimizing the crown's deserts and\r\nexaggerating the services of the Socialists. The liberal _bourgeois_ and\r\nthe Socialist press said in effect: \"And so this is our new democratic\r\nChancellor who advises the House of Lords to block an honest democratic\r\nreform of Prussia's iniquitous franchise system.\" The _Germania_, chief\r\norgan of the Clericals, Hertling's own party, damned the speech with\r\nfaint praise.\r\n\r\nTalk of a \"chancellor crisis\" was soon heard, and by the middle of\r\nSeptember there was little doubt that Hertling's days were numbered.\r\nNothing else can so adequately indicate the reversal of conditions in\r\nGermany as the fact that one of the men named oftenest even in\r\n_bourgeois_ circles as a likely successor to Count Hertling was Philip\r\nScheidemann, a leader of the Majority Socialists. The _vaterlandslose\r\nGesellen_ were coming into their own.\r\n\r\nThe crisis became acute on September 20th. The government unofficially\r\nsounded the Majority Socialists as to their willingness to participate\r\nin a coalition government. The question was discussed on September 22d,\r\nat a joint conference of the Socialist Reichstag deputies and the\r\nmembers of the party's executive committee. Although one of the cardinal\r\ntenets of Socialism had always forbidden participation in any but a\r\npurely Socialist government, the final vote was nearly four to one in\r\nfavor of abandoning this tenet in view of the extraordinary situation\r\nconfronting the empire. With eighty votes against twenty-two the\r\nconference decided to send representatives into a coalition government\r\nunder the following conditions:\r\n\r\n    1. The government shall unqualifiedly accept the declaration of\r\n    the Reichstag of July 19, 1917,[18] and declare its willingness\r\n    to enter a League of Nations whose fundamental principles shall\r\n    be the peaceful adjustment of all conflicts and universal\r\n    disarmament.\r\n\r\n    [18] _Vide_ chapter vi.\r\n\r\n    2. The government shall make an absolutely unambiguous\r\n    declaration of its willingness to rehabilitate\r\n    (_wiederherstellen_) Belgium and reach an understanding\r\n    regarding compensation to that land, and also to rehabilitate\r\n    Serbia and Montenegro.\r\n\r\n    3. The peace treaties of Brest-Litovsk and Bucharest shall not\r\n    be permitted to stand in the way of a general treaty of peace;\r\n    civil government shall be immediately established in all\r\n    occupied territories; occupied territories shall be evacuated\r\n    when peace is concluded; democratic representative assemblies\r\n    shall be established at once.\r\n\r\n    4. Autonomy shall be granted to Alsace-Lorraine; general, equal,\r\n    secret and direct right of franchise shall be granted in all\r\n    German federal states; the Prussian Diet shall be dissolved if\r\n    the deliberations of the House of Lords do not immediately\r\n    result in the adoption of the franchise-reform bills.\r\n\r\n    5. There shall be uniformity in the imperial government, and\r\n    irresponsible unofficial auxiliary governments\r\n    (_Nebenregierungen_) are to be eliminated; representatives of\r\n    the government shall be chosen from the majority of the\r\n    Reichstag or shall be persons who adhere to the policies of this\r\n    majority; political announcements by the crown or by military\r\n    authorities shall be communicated to the Imperial Chancellor\r\n    before they are promulgated.\r\n\r\n    6. Immediate rescission of all decrees limiting the right of\r\n    assembly or the freedom of the press; the censorship shall be\r\n    employed only in purely military matters (questions of tactics\r\n    and strategy, movements of troops, fabrication of munitions of\r\n    war, etc.); a political control shall be instituted for all\r\n    measures resorted to under the authority of the state of siege;\r\n    all military institutions that serve to exert political\r\n    influence shall be abolished.\r\n\r\nOn the whole this was a program which appealed to the vast majority of\r\nthe German people. The Conservatives and one wing of the National\r\nLiberals would have none of it, but the conviction that nothing but a\r\nchange of system would save Germany had been making rapid headway in the\r\nlast few weeks. Even many of those opposed in principle to democratic\r\ngovernment began to recognize that nothing else could unite the people.\r\nAn article in the _Vorwaerts_ by Scheidemann and another in the\r\nInternational Correspondence, an ably conducted news agency, pointing\r\nout the vital necessity of making any sacrifices that would save the\r\ncountry, were widely reprinted and made a strong appeal.\r\n\r\nChancellor Count Hertling, addressing the Reichstag on September 24th,\r\nmade a speech which, read between the lines, was a veiled admission of\r\nthe desperateness of the situation and the increasingly discouraged\r\ncondition of the people. He admitted frankly that the German armies had\r\nmet serious reverses on the west front. But Germany, he declared, had\r\nmet and triumphed over more serious situations. Russia and Roumania had\r\nbeen eliminated from the list of enemies, and he was confident that the\r\npeople would not lose heart because of temporary setbacks and that the\r\nsoldiers would continue to show their old spirit. Austria's peace\r\n_demarche_ had been taken in the face of serious doubts on the part of\r\nthe German Government regarding its advisability, but Germany, now as\r\nalways, was ready to conclude a just peace.\r\n\r\nGeneral von Wrisberg, said the Chancellor, reported that the English\r\nsuccesses against the Marne position and between the Ancre and the Aisne\r\nhad been due to fog and the extensive employment of tanks.\r\nCounter-measures had been taken and there was no reason for uneasiness.\r\nThe Germans had lost many prisoners and guns, but the enemy's losses had\r\nbeen frightful.\r\n\r\n\"The American armies need not frighten us,\" said Count Hertling. \"We\r\nshall take care of them.\"[19]\r\n\r\n[19] The German Government deceived its own people grossly in the\r\n    matter of the American forces in France. Hans Delbrueck,\r\n    editor of the _Preussische Jahrbuecher_, published on December\r\n    10, 1918, a statement that the government had forbidden him\r\n    to publish Secretary Baker's figures of the American\r\n    strength, as republished in the London _Times_. In response\r\n    to his protest, the Supreme Army Command declared that\r\n    Baker's figures were \"purely American bluff, calculated and\r\n    intended to mislead the German people.\" But the government\r\n    not only concealed the truth; it lied about the number of\r\n    Americans in France and even compelled the press to lie. A\r\n    confidential communication issued to the press in the middle\r\n    of May, 1918, declared that \"the number of American combatant\r\n    troops in France is about ten divisions, of which only four\r\n    are at the front. The total of all troops, both at the front\r\n    and behind the lines, does not exceed 150,000 to 200,000.\r\n    Press notices concerning these matters should state that\r\n    America has not been able to fulfil its expectations in the\r\n    way of sending troops, and that the earlier estimates of the\r\n    German General Staff as to what America could accomplish have\r\n    proved to be true. The actual figures given above should in\r\n    no case be mentioned.\" At this time there were nearly one\r\n    million Americans in France, and it is inconceivable that the\r\n    German Supreme Army Command did not know it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain von Brueninghaus of the Admiralty reported that the U-boats were\r\nsinking much more tonnage than was being built, and that the losses of\r\nsubmarines were much smaller than those reported by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe tone of the aged Chancellor's speech was such that his words carried\r\nno conviction. The war-weary, discouraged people could not but see in\r\nthem an admission that all was lost.\r\n\r\nAnd then came a blow that was felt by everybody. Bulgaria surrendered.\r\nThe first breach had been made in the alliance of the Central Powers;\r\nthe collapse had begun and its significance was plain to the humblest\r\nGerman. Bulgaria's defection came as no surprise to the government,\r\nwhich had known for nearly a week that such an event was at least\r\nprobable. On September 23d, King Ferdinand of Bulgaria had summoned a\r\ngrand council to consider the situation. The result was that a formal\r\ndemand was made on Berlin and Vienna for immediate assistance. Germany\r\nand Austria recognized the urgency of the situation, but they were\r\nunable to meet Bulgaria's demands. Both governments promised help in the\r\nnear future and besought King Ferdinand to keep up the struggle for a\r\nshort time.\r\n\r\nThe King realized the emptiness of these promises. There was, moreover,\r\na powerful personal dynastic interest at stake. Revolution of the\r\nreddest type already threatened his crown. Workmen and soldiers were\r\norganizing soviets in Sofia on the familiar Bolshevik plan, and riotous\r\ndemonstrations had been held in front of the royal palace. Help from\r\nBerlin and Vienna was obviously out of the question. Ferdinand turned to\r\nthe Entente.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations were brief. Bulgaria surrendered unconditionally. Her\r\nrailways and all other means of transportation were handed over to the\r\nAllies to be used for military or any other purposes. All strategic\r\npoints in the kingdom were likewise given into the control of Germany's\r\nenemies, and Bulgaria undertook to withdraw immediately all her troops\r\nfrom Greece and Serbia and disarm them.\r\n\r\nAs an ally Bulgaria had long ceased to play a decisive part in Germany's\r\nmilitary operations, but her surrender, apart from its moral effect, was\r\nnevertheless disastrous for Germany. General Mackensen's army suddenly\r\nfound itself in a hostile land, with its route of retreat threatened.\r\nThousands of German locomotives and cars, badly needed at home, stood on\r\ntracks now handed over to the control of Germany's enemies.\r\n\r\nWorst of all, completed enemy occupation of Bulgaria meant the isolation\r\nof Germany from another ally, for the only route to Constantinople ran\r\nthrough Bulgaria. The days of the Balkan Express, whose initial trip had\r\nbeen acclaimed as the inauguration of what would some day become the\r\nBerlin-to-Bagdad line, were numbered. Turkey, isolated, would no longer\r\nbe able to carry on the war, and reports were already current that\r\nTurkey would follow Bulgaria's example. British troops were but a few\r\nmiles from Damascus, and Bonar Law, reporting in a speech at Guildhall\r\nthe surrender of Bulgaria, added:\r\n\r\n    \"There is also something in connection with Turkey which I\r\n    cannot say, but which we can all think.\"\r\n\r\nUneasy rumors that Austria was also about to follow the lead of Bulgaria\r\nspread through Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser, wiser than his reactionary advisers, issued on the last day\r\nof September a proclamation, in which he declared it to be his will that\r\n\"the German people shall henceforth more effectively cooperate in\r\ndeciding the destinies of the Fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nBut the destinies of the Fatherland had already been decided by other\r\nthan political forces. The iron wall in the West that had for more than\r\nfour years withstood the shocks of the armies of a great part of the\r\ncivilized world was disintegrating or bending back. In the North the\r\nBelgians, fighting on open ground, were encircling Roulers, lying on the\r\nrailway connecting Lille with the German submarine bases in Zeebrugge\r\nand Ostende, and another junction on this important route, Menin, was\r\nmenaced by the British. Unless the enemy could be stopped here, all the\r\nrailways in the important triangle of Lille, Ghent, and Bruges must soon\r\nbe lost, and their loss meant the end of the U-boats as an important\r\nfactor in the war.\r\n\r\nTo the north and west of Cambrai the British, only a mile from the\r\ncenter of the city, were forcing their way forward relentlessly, and the\r\nFrench were closing in from the south on the doomed city, which was in\r\nflames. British and American troops were advancing steadily on St.\r\nQuentin and the French were approaching from the south. The American\r\nforces between the Argonnes and the Meuse were moving ahead, but slowly,\r\nfor the Germans had weakened their lines elsewhere in order to\r\nconcentrate heavy forces against the men from across the sea.\r\n\r\nCount Hertling confessed political shipwreck by resigning the\r\nchancellorship. With him went Vice Chancellor von Payer and Foreign\r\nMinister von Hintze. The Kaiser asked Prince Max (Maximilian), heir to\r\nthe throne of the Grand Duchy of Baden, to accept the post. He complied.\r\n\r\nThe choice of Prince Max was plainly a concession to and an\r\nacknowledgement of the fact that Germany had become overwhelmingly\r\ndemocratic, and it was at the same time a virtual confession that the\r\nmilitary situation was desperate and that peace must soon be sought.\r\nBaden had always been one of the most democratic of the German federal\r\nstates, and the Prince was, despite his rank, a decidedly democratic\r\nman. In the first years of the war he had distinguished himself as a\r\nhumane enemy, and had well earned the tribute paid to him by Ambassador\r\nJames W. Gerard in the Ambassador's book, _My Four Years in Germany_.\r\nThis tribute was paid in connection with a proposal to place Prince Max\r\nat the head of a central organization for prisoners of war in Germany.\r\nThe appointment, said Gerard, would have redounded to the benefit of\r\nGermany and the prisoners.\r\n\r\nPrince Max had for some years been recognized as the leader of the\r\nDelbrueck group of moderates, and his name had been considered for the\r\nchancellorship when Dr. Michaelis resigned. That he was not then\r\nappointed was due chiefly to his own reluctance, based upon dynastic\r\nreasons. He had never been in sympathy with _Schrecklichkeit_ in any of\r\nits manifestations, and was known to be out of sympathy with the ruling\r\ncaste in Prussia. Early in 1918 he had made public a semi-official\r\ninterview outlining his ideas as to what Germany's peace terms should\r\nbe. These were in general in accordance with the resolution of the\r\nmajority _bloc_ of the Reichstag of July 19, 1917, and condemned all\r\nannexations of foreign territory and all punitive indemnities. He\r\ndeclared also that the interests of Europe and America would be best\r\nserved by a peace which should not disrupt the Anglo-Saxon-Teutonic\r\npeoples, since Germany must be maintained as a bulwark against the\r\nspread of Bolshevism to the nations westward. The conclusion seems\r\njustified that the government believed that Prince Max, uncompromised\r\nand with known democratic leanings, could secure a more favorable peace\r\nfor Germany than any other man who could be named.\r\n\r\nAnd the government knew that peace must be had. It had heard so on\r\nOctober 2, the day before Prince Max's appointment, from the lips of a\r\nman who brought a message from Hindenburg and Ludendorff. What had long\r\nbeen feared had become a reality--an armistice must be requested. The\r\nbearer of these calamitous tidings was Major von Busche. Word had been\r\nsent that he was coming, and the leaders of the various Reichstag\r\nparties assembled to hear his message. Nominally the message came from\r\nHindenburg, as commander-in-chief, but really it was Ludendorff speaking\r\nthrough Hindenburg and his emissary.\r\n\r\nThe message was brief; Hindenburg, said Major von Busche, had become\r\nconvinced that a request for an armistice must be made. The General\r\nField Marshal had declared, however, that if the request should be\r\nrefused, or if dishonoring conditions should be imposed, the fight must\r\nand could go on. He had no intention of throwing his rifle into the\r\nditch. If necessary, Germany could continue fighting in enemy territory\r\nfor months. Von Busche did not admit in so many words that all hope of\r\nan eventual victory had been lost, but that was the effect of his\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\nThe men who heard from the highest military authorities in this blunt\r\nmanner that the situation was even worse than they had feared were\r\ndumfounded. If Hindenburg and Ludendorff had given up, there was nothing\r\nto be said. It was decided to ask for an armistice.\r\n\r\nPrince Max was inclined to refuse to become Imperial Chancellor if it\r\nmeant that his first act must be a confession of the impossibility of\r\ncarrying on the war longer--for that, he perceived clearly, would be the\r\nnatural and logical deduction from a request for an armistice. He\r\nparticularly disapproved of making the request as the first act of his\r\nchancellorship. This, he pointed out, would give a needless appearance\r\nof desperate haste and increase the depressing effect of the action,\r\nwhich would in any event be serious enough.\r\n\r\nPrince Max's attitude at this crisis was explained by him in an article\r\nin the _Preussische Jahrbuecher_ following the armistice. He wrote then:\r\n\r\n    \"My peace policy was gravely hampered by the request for an\r\n    armistice, which was presented to me completely formulated when\r\n    I reached Berlin. I opposed it on practical political grounds.\r\n    It seemed to me to be a great mistake to permit the new\r\n    government's first step toward peace to be followed by such a\r\n    surprising confession of German weakness. Neither our own people\r\n    nor the enemy countries estimated our military situation to be\r\n    such that a desperate step of this kind was necessary. I made a\r\n    counter-proposal. The government should as its first act draw up\r\n    a detailed program of its war-aims, and this program should\r\n    demonstrate to the whole world our agreement with Wilson's\r\n    principles and our honest willingness to make heavy national\r\n    sacrifices for these principles.\r\n\r\n    \"The military authorities replied that it was impossible to\r\n    await the result of such a declaration. The situation at the\r\n    front required that a request for an armistice be made within\r\n    twenty-four hours. If I refused to make it, the old government\r\n    would make it. I thereupon decided to form a new government and\r\n    to support the unavoidable request for an armistice with the\r\n    authority of a cabinet of uncompromised men. A week later the\r\n    military authorities informed me that they had erred in their\r\n    estimate of the situation at the front on October 1st.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Solf, formerly head of the German Colonial Office, became Foreign\r\nMinister, and Philip Scheidemann, the Socialist leader, and Deputy\r\nGroeber, a Clerical leader, also entered the new ministry. It was the\r\nfirst German ministry to contain a Social-Democrat, and the first which\r\ncould be said to have strong democratic leanings. Opinion in Washington,\r\naccording to a cablegram reaching Copenhagen early on October 4th, was\r\nthat the makeup of the cabinet was regarded in America \"as a desperate\r\nattempt of German militarists to hoodwink the Entente and the German\r\npeople into the belief that Germany is being democratized.\" This opinion\r\nwas inspired more by the passions of war than by clear thinking. Germany\r\nwas being democratized. That the democratic concessions attempted by\r\nvarious state rulers were inspired by fear is true, but their motives\r\nare of no importance. It is fruits that count, and the time had come\r\nwhen the German people could not longer be hoodwinked themselves by the\r\nmilitarists, nor be used as tools in hoodwinking anybody else. That\r\ntime, however, had come too late.\r\n\r\nOn October 6th, Prince Max, addressing the Reichstag, announced that a\r\nrequest for an armistice had been made. This request, which was\r\naddressed to President Wilson, said:\r\n\r\n    \"The German Government requests the President of the United\r\n    States to take in hand the restoring of peace, to acquaint all\r\n    the belligerent states with this request, and to invite them to\r\n    send plenipotentiaries for the purpose of opening negotiations.\r\n\r\n    \"It accepts the program set forth by the President of the United\r\n    States in his message to Congress on January 8th, and in his\r\n    later pronouncements, particularly his speech of September 27th,\r\n    as a basis for peace negotiations.\r\n\r\n    \"With a view to avoiding further bloodshed, the German\r\n    Government requests the immediate conclusion of an armistice on\r\n    land and water and in the air.\"\r\n\r\nSecretary of State Lansing sent the following reply on October 8th:\r\n\r\n    \"Before replying to the request of the Imperial[20] German\r\n    Government, and in order that that reply shall be as candid and\r\n    straightforward as the momentous interests involved require, the\r\n    President of the United States deems it necessary to assure\r\n    himself of the exact meaning of the note of the Imperial\r\n    Chancellor. Does the Imperial Chancellor mean that the Imperial\r\n    German Government accepts the terms laid down by the President\r\n    in his address to the Congress of the United States on the 8th\r\n    of January last and in subsequent addresses, and that its object\r\n    in entering into discussions would be only to agree upon the\r\n    practical details of their application?\r\n\r\n    [20] It will be noticed that Prince Max did not use the\r\n        designation \"Imperial\" in connection with the government.\r\n        The omission was undoubtedly deliberate and intended to\r\n        emphasize the democratic nature of the new cabinet.\r\n\r\n    \"The President feels bound to say with regard to the suggestion\r\n    of an armistice that he would not feel at liberty to propose a\r\n    cessation of arms to the governments with which the Government\r\n    of the United States is associated against the Central Powers so\r\n    long as the armies of those powers are upon their soil. The good\r\n    faith of any discussion would manifestly depend upon the consent\r\n    of the Central Powers immediately to withdraw their forces\r\n    everywhere from invaded territory. The President also feels that\r\n    he is justified in asking whether the Imperial Chancellor is\r\n    speaking merely for the constituted authorities of the Empire\r\n    who have so far conducted the war. He deems the answer to these\r\n    questions vital from every point of view.\"\r\n\r\nForeign Secretary Solf replied four days later with a note accepting\r\nPresident Wilson's peace terms as laid down in the \"fourteen points\" and\r\nthe supplementary five points later enunciated. He declared that the\r\nGerman Government was prepared to evacuate occupied territory, and\r\nsuggested the appointment of a mixed commission to arrange the details.\r\nHe asserted that the Chancellor, in making his request, was supported by\r\nthe vast majority of the Reichstag and spoke in the name of the German\r\nGovernment and the German people.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the request for an armistice was, so far as the enemy\r\ncountries were concerned, precisely what Prince Max had foreseen: it was\r\neverywhere taken as an admission of the hopelessness of the German\r\ncause. But its first effect within the Empire was not unfavorable.\r\nIndeed, there is reason to declare that it was favorable. The mass of\r\nthe people reposed much confidence in the new cabinet, and the prospect\r\nof an early peace buoyed up both the civil population and the soldiers.\r\nThe front, still being forced slowly back, nevertheless held on to every\r\navailable position with grim tenacity and in the face of heavy losses.\r\nOn October 8th, they repulsed a determined assault at the center of\r\ntheir long front and even counter-attacked in quite the old style.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n                   The Last Days of Imperial Germany.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrince Max, although inspired by the best intentions and filled with\r\nmodern and liberal ideas, failed to realize that what was needed was not\r\na change of men, but a change of methods. Radical, fearless and\r\nimmediate action was necessary, but the government did not perceive that\r\nevery passing day lessened its chances and possibilities. It relied upon\r\nthe slow progress of ordinary business routine. It accomplished much, it\r\nis true, but it accomplished it too slowly and too late.\r\n\r\nToo late the Conservatives in the Prussian Diet abandoned their\r\nopposition to a reform of the franchise system. On October 10th, they\r\nadopted this resolution:\r\n\r\n    \"In the hour of the Fatherland's greatest distress and with a\r\n    realization that we must be equipped for hard battles for the\r\n    integrity of the Fatherland's soil, the Conservative Party in\r\n    the Diet considers it its duty to lay aside all internal\r\n    conflicts. It is also ready to make heavy sacrifices for the\r\n    ends in view. It believes now, as ever, that a far-reaching\r\n    radicalization of the Prussian Constitution will not further the\r\n    welfare of the Prussian people. It is nevertheless prepared to\r\n    abandon its opposition to the introduction of equal franchise in\r\n    Prussia in accordance with the latest decisions of its friends\r\n    in the House of Lords in order to assure the formation of a\r\n    harmonious front against the outside world.\"\r\n\r\nThis resolution removed the last obstacle to a real reform of the\r\nPrussian franchise.\r\n\r\nToo late the Federal Council adopted radical amendments to the Imperial\r\nConstitution. On October 13th and 16th, it accepted measures repealing\r\nArticle 21, paragraph 2, which provided that Reichstag members should\r\nforfeit their seats if they accepted salaried state or imperial offices,\r\nand providing that cabinet members should no longer be required to be\r\nmembers of the Federal Council, but should at all times have the right\r\nto demand a hearing before the Reichstag. It also amended Article 2 to\r\nread: \"The consent of the Federal Council and the Reichstag is required\r\nfor a declaration of war in the Empire's name, except in a case where\r\nimperial territory has already been invaded or its coasts attacked.\"\r\nSection 3 of the same article was amended to read: \"Treaties of peace\r\nand treaties with foreign states which deal with affairs coming under\r\nthe competence of the Imperial law-giving bodies require the consent of\r\nthe Federal Council and the Reichstag.\"\r\n\r\nToo late the rulers of different states promised democratic reforms. The\r\ncrown council of Saxony on October 10th summoned the Landtag (Diet) for\r\nOctober 26th, and directed the minister of the interior to draft a\r\nmeasure \"which shall substitute for the franchise now obtaining for the\r\nLandtag's second chamber a franchise based on a broader foundation.\"\r\nSaxony then had a four-class system. The crown council also considered\r\nrequesting the Socialists to join the government.\r\n\r\nThe King of Bavaria caused it to be announced that the crown had decided\r\nto introduce reforms enabling Bavaria's popularly elected\r\nrepresentatives to participate directly in governing the kingdom.\r\nMinister Dandl was directed to form a new ministry with some Socialist\r\nmembers. It was announced also that a proportional franchise system was\r\nto be introduced and the upper chamber reformed along progressive lines.\r\n\r\nThe government of Baden announced that steps would be taken to abolish\r\nthe three-class franchise and to introduce the proportional system. In\r\nWuerttemberg measures were prepared providing that the kingdom's\r\nrepresentatives in the Federal Council should take their instructions\r\ndirect from the people's elected representatives, instead of from the\r\ngovernment. A democratization of the first chamber was also promised.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Duke of Oldenburg, in the address from the throne at the\r\nopening of the Landtag, declared that reforms were contemplated giving\r\nthe people increased power to decide all important questions of state.\r\nThe Grand Duke of Saxe-Weimar accepted the resignation of his whole\r\nministry and announced that a new ministry would be formed from among\r\nthe members of the Diet. The Diet at Darmstadt unanimously adopted\r\nmeasures providing for a parliamentary form of government in Hesse.\r\n\r\nBut while these concessions were being made at home, _Schrecklichkeit_\r\ncontinued to rule unhampered on the sea. The _Leinster_, a passenger\r\nboat plying between Kingston and Holyhead, was torpedoed by a submarine,\r\nand 480 of her 687 passengers were lost. The wave of indignation in\r\nenemy countries following this act was reflected at home in an uneasy\r\nfeeling that the new Chancellor could as little curb militarism as could\r\nhis predecessors. Ludendorff, too, had regained his lost nerve. He told\r\nPrince Max that the military situation was better than he had believed\r\nwhen he recommended that an armistice be requested. Minister of War\r\nGeneral Scheuch had promised to send six hundred thousand new troops to\r\nthe front.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor's position was also rendered more difficult at this time\r\nby an agitation for a _levee en masse_ begun by some fire-eating Germans\r\nof the old school. The possibility of a military dictatorship was\r\ndiscussed, and an appeal was made to \"the spirit of 1813.\" The natural\r\nresult was to increase the prevailing hostility to everybody in\r\nauthority, whether he had been connected with the former governments or\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Socialists and their Spartacan brethren grew bolder. Dr.\r\nOskar Cohn, who had made a speech in the Reichstag four months earlier,\r\ndenouncing the war as \"a Hohenzollern family affair,\" now openly\r\ndeclared in the same assembly that the Kaiser must go.\r\n\r\n\"The question can no longer be evaded,\" he said. \"Shall it be war with\r\nthe Hohenzollerns or peace without the Hohenzollerns? World-revolution\r\nwill follow on world-imperialism and world-militarism, and we shall\r\novercome them. We extend our hands to our friends beyond the frontiers\r\nin this struggle.\"\r\n\r\nLiebknecht, released from prison on October 20th by a general amnesty,\r\ncelebrated his release by attacking the Kaiser and the government that\r\nreleased him. On October 27th, he addressed a half dozen Independent\r\nSocialist meetings, and called for a revolution of the proletariat and\r\nthe overthrow of the capitalists and _bourgeoisie_ of all lands. He\r\nclosed each speech with cries of \"Down with the Hohenzollerns!\" and\r\n\"Long live the Socialist Republic!\" Nothing could more clearly\r\ndemonstrate the helplessness of the government than the fact that\r\nLiebknecht was neither compelled to stop talking nor arrested. There\r\nwere outbreaks of rioting in Berlin on the same day, but they were\r\nlargely due to the unwise and provocatory measures of the police, who to\r\nthe last preserved a steadfast loyalty to the government and to that\r\ngrim sense of duty that had marked the Prussian _Beamter_ in former\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThe Reichstag passed on last reading the measures sent from the Federal\r\nCouncil to put into effect the Kaiser's recommendations of September\r\n30th. Their most important provision was one placing the military\r\ncommand under control of the civil government, which had been demanded\r\nby the Majority Socialists as one of their conditions for participation\r\nin the government. The Kaiser sent to the Imperial Chancellor on October\r\n28th the following decree:\r\n\r\n    \"I send your Grand Ducal Highness in the enclosure the measures\r\n    for the alteration of the Imperial Constitution and of the laws\r\n    concerning the representative powers of the Chancellor, of March\r\n    17, 1878, for immediate promulgation. It is my wish, in\r\n    connection with this step, which is so full of meaning for the\r\n    German people, to give expression to the feelings that move me.\r\n    Prepared by a number of acts of the government, a new order of\r\n    things now becomes effective, transferring fundamental rights\r\n    from the person of the Kaiser to the people. Thus there is\r\n    closed a period which will endure in honor in the eyes of future\r\n    generations.\r\n\r\n    \"Despite all struggles between inherited powers and forces\r\n    striving to raise themselves, this period discloses itself\r\n    unforgettably in the wonderful accomplishments of the war. In\r\n    the fearful storms of the four years of the war, however, old\r\n    formulae have been shattered, not to leave ruins, but rather to\r\n    give way to new forms of life. In view of the accomplishments of\r\n    this period, the German people can demand that no right shall be\r\n    withheld from them which insures a free and happy future. The\r\n    measures proposed by the allied governments[21] and now accepted\r\n    by the Reichstag owe their existence to this conviction.\r\n\r\n    [21] Here meaning merely the German federal states.\r\n\r\n    \"I accept these decisions of the people's representatives,\r\n    together with my exalted allies, in the firm desire to\r\n    cooperate, as far as lies in my power, in rendering them\r\n    effective, and in the conviction that I shall thus serve the\r\n    interests of the German people.\r\n\r\n    \"The post of Kaiser means service of the people (_Das Kaiseramt\r\n    ist Dienst am Volke_).\r\n\r\n    \"May the new order release all good forces which our people need\r\n    in order to endure the hard trials that have been visited upon\r\n    the Empire, and to win the way, with firm step, from out the\r\n    dark present to a bright future.\"\r\n\r\nThese were fine phrases, but, like all other pronunciamentos and reforms\r\nof October, they came too late. The political censorship had recently\r\nbeen relaxed, and the people, ignorant though they may have been of\r\nactual conditions at home, knew what was going on within the borders of\r\ntheir greatest ally. Ten days earlier a strike had been begun at Prague\r\nas a peace demonstration, and had involved much of Bohemia and Moravia.\r\nAt Budapest revolution was in the air, and the Magyar deputies of the\r\nParliament were openly discussing the question of declaring Hungary's\r\nindependence. On October 17th, Kaiser Karl announced that steps were to\r\nbe taken to reorganize the Monarchy on a federalized basis.\r\n\r\nTwo days later President Wilson rejected Baron Burian's peace offer.\r\nHe declared that the United States Government had recognized the\r\nCzecho-Slovak state and the aspirations of the Jugo-Slavs, and he was\r\ntherefore \"no longer at liberty to accept the mere autonomy of these\r\npeoples as a basis of peace, but is obliged to insist that they and\r\nnot he shall be the judges of what action on the part of the\r\nAustro-Hungarian Government will satisfy their aspirations and their\r\nconception of their rights and destiny as members of the family of\r\nnations.\"\r\n\r\nCount Michael Karolyi, leader of the opposition in Hungary, on the same\r\nday, in a speech in the lower house of Parliament at Budapest, attacked\r\nthe alliance of Austria-Hungary with Germany. He admitted that the\r\nCentral Powers had lost the war, and appealed to his countrymen to \"try\r\nto save the peace.\" A memorial was sent to Kaiser Karl declaring that\r\n\"Hungary must return to its autonomy and complete independence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Czechs were already in virtual control in Prague. Magyar Hungary was\r\nrotten with Bolshevism, the fruits of the propaganda of returned\r\nsoldiers and Russian agents. Croatian soldiers at Fiume had revolted.\r\nBaron Burian retired and was succeeded by Count Andrassy.\r\n\r\nMuch of this was known to all Germans when the Kaiser's decree was\r\nissued. But they did not know what the Kaiser and his advisers knew, and\r\nthey did not know why Ludendorff had deserted the sinking ship a day\r\nearlier, sending his resignation to the Kaiser and being succeeded as\r\nQuartermaster-General by General Groener. All indications had, indeed,\r\npointed to the defection of Austria, but so long as it did not come the\r\nGermans--that is, such of them as had not completely lost hope or been\r\ninfected with internationalist doctrines--still had a straw to cling to.\r\n\r\nOn October 26th Kaiser Karl informed the German Emperor that he intended\r\nto ask for peace \"within twenty-four hours.\" He invited Germany to join\r\nin the request. Before the German reply could be received Count Andrassy\r\nsent a note to Washington accepting President Wilson's conditions for an\r\narmistice and for peace, and declaring that Austria-Hungary was ready,\r\n\"without awaiting the result of other negotiations, to enter into\r\nnegotiations upon peace between Austria-Hungary and the states in the\r\nopposing group, and for an immediate armistice upon all the Dual\r\nMonarchy's fronts.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 29th the government at Vienna issued a report declaring that\r\na note had been sent to Secretary Lansing, asking him to \"have the\r\ngoodness to intervene with the President of the United States in order\r\nthat, in the interests of humanity as well as in the interests of all\r\nthose peoples who live in Austria-Hungary, an immediate armistice may be\r\nconcluded on all fronts, and for an overture that immediate negotiations\r\nfor peace may follow.\" A semi-official statement was issued the same day\r\nin an attempt to make it appear that the Dual Monarchy had not been\r\nrecreant to its treaty agreement not to conclude a separate peace. Count\r\nAndrassy's note to Lansing, it was explained, did not \"necessarily mean\r\nan offer of a separate peace. It means merely that Austria-Hungary is\r\nready to act separately in the interests of the reestablishment of\r\npeace.\"\r\n\r\nThe fine distinction between \"separate peace\" and \"separate action to\r\nreestablish peace\" could deceive nobody. All Germany staggered under the\r\nblow, and while she was still staggering, there came another. Turkey\r\nquit. Germany stood alone, deserted, betrayed.\r\n\r\nFast on the heels of the Austrian collapse came the terror of defeated\r\ngovernments--revolution. The ink had not dried on Vienna's note on\r\nOctober 29th before students and workingmen began assembling in front of\r\nthe Parliament buildings in the Austrian capital. Officers in uniform\r\naddressed cheering thousands, and called on the soldiers among their\r\nhearers to remove the national colors from their caps and uniforms.\r\nPresident Dinghofer of the National Council declared that the council\r\nwould take over the whole administration of the country, \"but without\r\nthe Habsburgs.\" When, on the same afternoon, the National Assembly came\r\ntogether for its regular session, a crowd gathered in front of the Diet\r\nand cheered a huge red flag unfurled by workingmen on the very steps of\r\nthe Diet building.\r\n\r\nRevolution is both contagious and spontaneous in defeat. The news from\r\nVienna was followed by reports of revolution in Hungary. In Budapest\r\nlaborers plundered the military depots and armed themselves. In Prague\r\nthe _Prager Haus-Regiment_, No. 28, took charge of the revolution. This\r\nwas one of the regiments that had been disbanded in 1915 for treachery\r\nin the Carpathians. Now it came into its own. Count Michael Karolyi\r\ntelegraphed on October 31st to the Berlin _Tageblatt_:\r\n\r\n    \"Revolution in Budapest. National Council has taken over the\r\n    government. Military and police acknowledge National Council\r\n    completely. Inhabitants rejoicing.\"\r\n\r\nThe message was signed by Karolyi as president of the National Council.\r\n\r\nThe revolution in Bohemia exercised a particularly depressing effect\r\nupon loyal Germans because of its outspoken anti-German character. Even\r\nin these first days the Czechish newspapers began discussing the\r\ndivision of German territories. The _Vecer_ demanded Vienna as a part of\r\nthe new Czecho-Slovak state on the ground that a majority of the city's\r\ninhabitants or their ancestors originally came from Bohemia and Moravia.\r\nThe _Narodini Listy_ gave notice that the Germans of Northern Bohemia\r\nwould not be permitted to join Germany. These were among the more\r\nmoderate demands made by this press.\r\n\r\n\"What will the Kaiser do?\" asked the Berlin _Vorwaerts_ in its leading\r\nArticle on the last day of October. The article voiced a question which\r\nall but the most extreme reactionaries had been asking for two weeks.\r\nEven men devoted to the monarch personally and themselves convinced\r\nmonarchists in principle realized that the only hope of securing a just\r\npeace lay in sacrificing Kaiser Wilhelm. Scheidemann, the Socialist\r\nSecretary of State, wrote to Chancellor Prince Max, declaring that the\r\nKaiser must retire, and that his letter had been written \"in agreement\r\nwith the leaders of the Socialist party and its representatives in the\r\nReichstag.\" Up to the time of the publication of the _Vorwaerts_ leader\r\nthe authorities had forbidden any public discussion of the Kaiser's\r\nabdication. The censorship restrictions on this subject were now removed\r\nand the press was permitted to discuss it freely.\r\n\r\nBut while many of the party leaders were already inwardly convinced that\r\nthe supreme sacrifice of abdication must be made by the Kaiser, none of\r\nthe Empire's political parties except the two Socialist parties\r\nconsidered it politically expedient to make the demand. Even the\r\nProgressives, farthest to the left of all the _bourgeois_ parties, not\r\nonly refused to follow the Socialists' lead, but went on record as\r\nopposed to abdication. At a convention of the party in Greater Berlin on\r\nNovember 6th, Dr. Mugdan, one of the party's prominent Reichstag\r\ndeputies, reporting the attitude of the party on the question of\r\nabdication, said:\r\n\r\n    \"The Progressives do not desire to sow further unrest and\r\n    confusion among the German people.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the attitude of a majority of the leaders among the people. It\r\nwas dictated less by loyalty to the sovereign than by a realization that\r\nthe disintegrating propaganda of the Internationalists had affected so\r\nlarge a part of the people that the abdication of the Kaiser would\r\nalmost inevitably bring the collapse of the state. They could not yet\r\nrealize that this collapse was inevitable in any case, nor that the\r\nnumber of those devoted to the Kaiser was comparatively so small that it\r\nwas of little consequence whether he remained on the throne or\r\nabdicated.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser himself, as will be seen later,[22] was mainly moved by the\r\nsame considerations. He believed chaos would certainly follow his\r\nabdication. It is also far from improbable that he had not yet abandoned\r\nall hope of military victory. The German army leaders, in trying to\r\ndeceive the people into a belief that a successful termination of the\r\nwar was still possible, had doubtless deceived their monarch as well.\r\nPossibly they had even deceived themselves. Field Marshal von Hindenburg\r\nsent a message to the press on November 3d, wherein he declared:\r\n\r\n    \"Our honor, freedom and future are now at stake. We are\r\n    invincible if we are united. If the German army be strongly\r\n    supported by the will of the people, our Fatherland will brave\r\n    all onslaughts.\"\r\n\r\n    [22] _Vide_ chapter X.\r\n\r\nBut while Hindenburg was writing the situation was altering for the\r\nworse with every hour. Kaiser Karl had fled from Vienna. German officers\r\nhad been attacked in Bucharest. Bavarian troops had been refused\r\npermission to use railways in Austrian Tirol. German troops had been\r\ndisarmed and robbed in Bohemia and even in Hungary. The German armies in\r\nthe West were still fighting bravely, but even the ingeniously worded\r\ncommuniques of Great Headquarters could not conceal the fact that they\r\nwere being steadily thrown back, with heavy loss of prisoners and guns.\r\nRumors of serious revolts in the fleet were circulating from mouth to\r\nmouth and, after the manner of rumors, growing as they circulated. Even\r\nthe monarchist, Conservative _Lokal-Anzeiger_ had to admit the gravity\r\nof the situation. On November 6th it declared that \"a mighty stream\" was\r\nrolling through the land, and every one who had eyes to see and ears to\r\nhear could perceive \"whither this current is setting.\" It continued:\r\n\r\n    \"New factors of great importance have increased the confusion:\r\n    the collapse of our allies, their complete submission to the\r\n    will of our enemies, the multiplication thereby of the military\r\n    dangers that surround us, and, not least, the catastrophic\r\n    dissolution of all order in Austria-Hungary. The blind\r\n    fanaticism of Bolshevism, which would with brutal force tear\r\n    down everything in its way and destroy in Germany as well every\r\n    remnant of authority, is planning now, in the very moment when\r\n    the final decision must be reached, to play into the hands of\r\n    our enemies through internal revolution. We will not at this\r\n    time discuss whether the authorities have done their complete\r\n    duty in putting down this movement, which everyone could see\r\n    growing. It is enough to say that the danger is here, and duty\r\n    demands that we stand together from left to right, from the top\r\n    to the bottom, to render these destroying elements harmless or,\r\n    if it be too late for that, to strike them to the ground.\r\n\r\n    \"And another thing must be said. Just as the people's government\r\n    has undertaken to bring about a peace that does not destroy the\r\n    vital interests of the German people, * * * it must just as\r\n    energetically endeavor to protect us from internal collapse with\r\n    all the strength and all the authority which its constitution as\r\n    a people's government confers upon it. * * * When, as now, the\r\n    overthrow of all existing institutions is being preached, when\r\n    the people's government is disregarded and recourse is had to\r\n    force, the government must realize that there is but one thing\r\n    to do. The people, whose representatives the members of\r\n    government are, want concrete evidence that an insignificant\r\n    minority will not be permitted to trample upon the institutions\r\n    of state and society under whose protection we have heretofore\r\n    lived. * * * The German Empire is not yet ripe for the disciples\r\n    of Lenine and Trotzky.\"\r\n\r\nGeneral von Hellingrath, Bavarian Minister of War, issued a proclamation\r\ncalling on the people to preserve order and not to lose their confidence\r\nin the government. A report that Bavarian troops had been sent to the\r\nNorth Tirol to protect Bavaria's borders against possible aggression by\r\nCzechish and Jugo-Slavic troops of the former ally further depressed all\r\nGermans, and particularly the South Germans.\r\n\r\nThe new government made an appeal to the people's reason. In a\r\nproclamation issued on November 4th and signed by Prince Max and all\r\nother members of the cabinet, including Scheidemann, it called attention\r\nto the parliamentary reforms already accomplished and summoned the\r\npeople to give their fullest support to the government. These reforms\r\nwere:\r\n\r\n    Equal franchise in Prussia; the formation of a government from\r\n    the majority parties of the Reichstag; the Chancellor and his\r\n    ministers could retain office only if they possessed the\r\n    confidence of the Reichstag and hence of the people;\r\n    declarations of war and conclusions of peace now required the\r\n    assent of the Reichstag; the military had been subordinated to\r\n    the civil authorities; a broad amnesty had been declared, and\r\n    the freedom of assemblage and of the press assured.\r\n\r\n\"The alteration of Germany into a people's state, which shall not stand\r\nin the rear of any state in the world in respect of political freedom\r\nand social reforms, will be carried further with decision,\" said the\r\nproclamation.\r\n\r\nIt was a very respectable array of real reforms that was thus set forth.\r\nIf they had come a few months earlier the subsequent course of Germany's\r\nand the whole world's history would doubtless have been changed. But,\r\nunknown to the great mass of Germans except through wild rumor,\r\nrevolution had already come and the German Empire was tottering to its\r\nfall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n                  A Revolt Which Became a Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe elements that had long been working to bring about a revolution had\r\nfor months been nearer their goal than even they themselves suspected,\r\nbut they were nevertheless not ready for the final step when events,\r\ntaking the bit into their teeth, ran away with the revolutionists along\r\nthe very road which they had wanted to follow.\r\n\r\nIt lies in the nature of the employment of those that go down to the sea\r\nin ships that they are more resolute and reckless than their\r\nshore-keeping brothers, and less amenable to discipline. They are also\r\nsubject to certain cosmopolitan, international influences which do not\r\nfurther blind patriotism. Furthermore, the percentage of rude, violent\r\nand even criminally inclined men is proportionately higher afloat than\r\nashore. The Russian revolution of 1905 started among the sailors in\r\nCronstadt. The same men set the example in atrocities against officers\r\nin the Russian revolution of 1917. Sailors played a prominent part in\r\nthe Portuguese revolution, and there are few fleets in the world without\r\ntheir history of rough deeds done by mutinous mariners.\r\n\r\nOn October 28th there came an order from the Admiralty at Berlin that\r\nthe fleet was to be prepared for a cruise into the North Sea. Just what\r\nthis cruise was intended to accomplish is not clear. High naval officers\r\nhave assured the writer that it was to have been primarily a\r\nreconnaissance, and that no naval battle was intended or desired. The\r\nreport circulated among the crews, however, that a last desperate stand\r\nwas to be made, in which the whole fleet would be sacrificed, but in\r\nwhich as great losses as possible were to be inflicted on the British\r\nFleet. This was not at all to the liking of men demoralized by long\r\nidleness--an idleness, moreover, in which Bolshevist Satans had found\r\nmuch work for them to do.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, too, came a gruesome story which further unfavorably\r\naffected the crews' morale. A submarine cruiser, it was reported, had\r\nbecome entangled in a net, but had freed itself and reached port,\r\ndragging the net with it. When the net was pulled ashore, it was\r\ndeclared, three small U-boats were found fast in it, their crews dead of\r\nsuffocation. The story was probably false, but it increased the men's\r\nopposition to the cruise ordered. They were also disquieted by the fact\r\nthat large numbers of floating mines were being brought aboard the\r\nspeedier cruisers.\r\n\r\nRumblings of the coming storm were heard first on board the battleships\r\n_Thueringen_ and _Helgoland_, a part of whose crews flatly refused to\r\nobey orders to carry out the cruise ordered by the Admiralty. The mutiny\r\nwas not general even aboard these ships, and it was quickly quelled. The\r\nembers, however, smouldered for three days and then burst into flame.\r\n\r\nAlone among the great revolutions of the world, the German revolution\r\nwas the work of the humblest of the proletariat, unplanned and unguided\r\nby _bourgeois_ elements. It came from below not only in the figurative\r\nbut also in the literal sense of the word, for it came from the very\r\nhold of a battleship. It was the stokers of the _Markgraf_ at Kiel who\r\nset rolling the stone which became the avalanche of revolution.\r\n\r\nThe crews of the _Markgraf_ and of some of the other ships in the Kiel\r\nsquadron demanded that the mines be taken ashore and the projected\r\ncruise abandoned. The officers refused their demands. Thereupon the\r\nstokers of the _Markgraf_ left the ship and went ashore. This was on\r\nSunday morning, November 3d. The stokers were joined by members of other\r\nships' crews ashore at the time, and a meeting was held. When the\r\nstokers returned to the _Markgraf_ they found her guarded by marines and\r\nthey were not permitted to come aboard. They boarded another ship nearby\r\nand demanded their dinner. Messtime had passed while they were holding\r\ntheir meeting ashore, and their demand was refused. The stokers broke\r\ninto the provision-rooms and helped themselves. Thereupon the mutineers,\r\nabout one hundred and fifty in number, were arrested and taken to the\r\nmilitary prison in the center of the city. All the small boats of the\r\n_Markgraf_ were taken ashore to prevent the rest of the crew from\r\nreaching land.\r\n\r\nWhen the arrest of the mutinous stokers became known aboard their\r\nbattleship there was an outburst of indignation. The officers, in\r\nsending the boats ashore, had overlooked an old barge which lay\r\nalongside the ship. As many of the crew as the barge could carry\r\nclambered into it and rowed ashore, using boards as paddles. Then they\r\nsent the small boats back to bring ashore the rest of their comrades. At\r\nfour o'clock in the afternoon practically the entire crew of the\r\n_Markgraf_ held a meeting on the large promenade and maneuver grounds\r\nnear the harbor. A great many members of other ships' crews attended\r\nthis meeting. Violent speeches were made and it was decided to demand\r\nthe immediate release of the _Markgraf's_ stokers. Shortly before six\r\no'clock the inflamed mob--it was already little else--went to the\r\nWaldwiese (city park), where a company of the First Marine Division was\r\nquartered. The mutineers demolished the barracks, released several men\r\nwho were locked up for minor military offenses, and stole all the arms\r\nand ammunition in the place.\r\n\r\nAn ordered procession then started toward the center of the city. It\r\ngrew steadily in size as it went through accretions from sailors,\r\nmarines and other members of war-vessels' crews, and also from the\r\nriotous and criminal elements common to all larger cities and especially\r\nto harbor-cities.\r\n\r\nThe military authorities had meanwhile made preparations to deal with\r\nthe mutineers. As early as four o'clock _erhoehte Alarmbereitschaft_\r\n(literally, \"increased readiness to respond to an alarm\") had been\r\nordered. Buglers and drummers passed through the streets, proclaiming\r\nthe order and warning against demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe mutineers' procession reached the central railway station about 7\r\nP.M., and proceeded, its numbers increasing steadily, through the\r\nHolsteinstrasse to the Market Place. It passed through the Daenische\r\nStrasse and Brunswigerstrasse toward Feldstrasse, in which was situated\r\nthe military prison where the _Markgraf_ stokers were confined. The\r\nprocession had by this time become a howling, whistling, singing mob,\r\nwhose progress could be heard many blocks away. Passers-by were\r\ncompelled to join the procession. The entrances to the Hospitalstrasse\r\nand to the Karlstrasse at the so-called _Hoffnung_, near the prison,\r\nwere guarded by strong military forces, and the prison itself was\r\nprotected by a machine-gun detachment. Firemen were also ready to turn\r\ntheir hoses on the mob.\r\n\r\nThe procession reached the _Hoffnung_ and prepared to force its way into\r\nthe Karlstrasse. The commander of the troops stationed there ordered the\r\nmob to halt. His order was disregarded. The troops fired a blind volley\r\nover the heads of the mutineers, who nevertheless forged steadily ahead.\r\nThe next volley was poured into the ranks of the marchers. It was\r\nfollowed by shrieks of rage, by scattering shots from the mutineers and\r\nby some stone-throwing. There was a sharp conflict for two or three\r\nminutes, and then the mob, howling and cursing, scattered\r\npanic-stricken.[23] Eight of them lay dead on the street, and\r\ntwenty-nine were wounded. The officer in command of the troops and one\r\nlieutenant were also fatally injured, the former by knife-thrusts and\r\nstones.\r\n\r\n[23] In all the clashes that marked the subsequent course of the\r\n    German revolution not one instance can be found where the\r\n    enemies of authority failed to run like sheep before loyal\r\n    troops and determined officers. The \"martyrs of the\r\n    revolution\" were mainly killed by stray bullets or overtaken\r\n    by bullets while they were running away.\r\n\r\nAn hour later the street was quiet, and the night passed without further\r\ndisturbances. The city was strongly patrolled, but otherwise there was\r\nnothing to indicate that the curtain had gone up on the world's greatest\r\nand most tragic revolution.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the mutineers spent most of Sunday night and Monday\r\nmorning in conference. A Soldiers' Council was formed--the first in\r\nGermany. The military governor of Kiel issued a proclamation, calling\r\nupon the mutineers to formulate and present their demands. They\r\ncomplied. Their demands were: The release of all persons arrested for\r\nbreach of discipline; recognition of the Soldiers' Council; abolishing\r\nof the duty to salute superiors;[24] officers and men to have the same\r\nrations; the proposed expedition of the fleet to be abandoned, and, in\r\ngeneral, better treatment of the ships' crews. The governor accepted all\r\nthese demands, and announcement was made to that effect by wireless to\r\nall ships in the Kiel squadron. The mutineers declared themselves\r\nsatisfied, and promised to resume their duties, to obey orders and to\r\npreserve order in the city and board their ships.\r\n\r\n[24] It is difficult to understand why Socialists attach such\r\n    importance to this question. It will be remembered that the\r\n    very first decree issued by Kerensky was his famous (and\r\n    fatal) \"Prikaz No. 1,\" abolishing the salute. The Socialists,\r\n    it is true, hate authority as embodied in a state, yet they\r\n    voluntarily submit to a party authority quite as rigid as\r\n    that of Prussian militarism.\r\n\r\nIn circumstances at all approaching the normal this would have marked\r\nthe end of the revolt. But all the circumstances were abnormal. The men\r\nof the navy had, indeed, suffered fewer actual privations and hardships\r\nthan those of the land forces, but even they had been underfed. Their\r\nfamilies, in common with all Germans at home, had endured bitter want,\r\nand had written thousands of complaining letters to their relatives\r\nafloat.[25] The Socialist contagion--particularly of the Independent\r\nbrand--had affected wide circles among sailors and marines. Indeed, the\r\nchief field of operations of the Ruehles, Haases, Cohns and their Russian\r\nhelpers had been the navy, where idle hands invited the finding of\r\nmischief for them to do. The morale of the members of the navy had also,\r\nin common with the morale of the land troops and of the whole German\r\npeople, been badly shaken by the reverses that began in July, 1918, and\r\nby the desertion of Germany by her allies.\r\n\r\n[25] Complaining letters from home to the men in the trenches\r\n    were early recognized by the authorities as a source of\r\n    danger for the spirit of the troops.\r\n\r\nIn addition to and above all this there were two fatal factors:\r\nauthority, the corner stone of all civilized governments, had been\r\nshaken, and the mutineers had learned their own strength. If horses were\r\nsentient beings with means of communicating their thoughts, and if all\r\nthe horses of a certain community suddenly discovered that they were\r\nreally immeasurably stronger than their masters, it would require no\r\ngreat effort of imagination to realize that few horses in that community\r\nwould thereafter suffer themselves to be harnessed. The only ones that\r\nwould submit would be a small number of especially intelligent animals\r\nwho could look ahead to the winter, with deep snow covering the\r\npastures, with no straw-bedded stalls and walls set up against the cold\r\nwinds.\r\n\r\nSo it was in Kiel. The mutineers had made their first kill; they had\r\ntasted blood. From all the ships of the squadron they streamed into the\r\ncity. Patrols, established to maintain order, began going over to the\r\nrevolting seamen. The mutineers secured more arms and ammunition from\r\nthe barracks at the shipyards and the soldiers stationed there joined\r\nthem. In the afternoon (Monday) the mutineers joined for a giant\r\ndemonstration. A procession numbering possibly twenty thousand sailors,\r\nmarines and soldiers, with a band at the head, marched to the different\r\ncivil and military prisons and lockups and released the prisoners, who\r\njoined the procession. The civil and military authorities of Kiel,\r\ngravely disquieted, had meanwhile communicated with the government at\r\nBerlin and asked for help. The government replied that it would send\r\nConrad Haussmann and Gustav Noske. Haussmann, who had for many years\r\nbeen one of the leaders of the Clerical (Catholic) party in the\r\nReichstag, was a member of Prince Max's cabinet. He was chosen as the\r\ngovernment's official representative. Noske, who was later to\r\ndemonstrate himself to be one of the few really able and forceful men of\r\nGermany, had been for some years a member of the Reichstag as Majority\r\nSocialist. A woodworker by trade, he had as a youth lifted himself out\r\nof the ruck of his party by energy, ambition, hard work and\r\nstraightforwardness. He became a party secretary and later editor of a\r\nSocialist paper in Chemnitz.[26] Although not so widely known as many\r\nother Socialist leaders in the Reichstag, he nevertheless played a\r\nprominent part in his party's councils and was highly regarded and\r\nrespected. He enjoyed also a wide popularity among members of the fleet,\r\nand it was confidently expected that he would be able to calm the unruly\r\ntroublemakers and restore order.\r\n\r\n[26] The typical career of a German Socialist leader. It is not\r\n    far afield to estimate that seven of every ten of the\r\n    Socialist leaders and government officials in Germany have\r\n    been or still are members of the editorial staffs of\r\n    Socialist newspapers or magazines. Most of the others are\r\n    lawyers; proletarians who earn their bread by the actual\r\n    sweat of their brows are rare in the party leadership.\r\n\r\nHaussmann and Noske reached Kiel late Monday afternoon. The parading\r\nmutineers met them at the station. Noske, speaking from the top of an\r\nautomobile, addressed the crowd, appealing to their patriotism and to\r\nthe German instinct for orderly procedure. Their main demands, he\r\npointed out, had already been granted. The government, representing all\r\nparties of the empire, promised that all grievances should be heard and\r\nredressed. The speech appeared to have some effect. Isolated\r\ndemonstrations took place until into the evening, but there were no\r\nserious clashes anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe situation seemed somewhat more hopeful. The leaders on both sides\r\neither could not or did not realize what powerful and pernicious\r\ninfluences were working against them. The Governor felt his hand\r\nstrengthened by the presence of Haussmann, the Minister; the Workmen's\r\nand Soldiers' Council was both calmed and encouraged by the presence of\r\nNoske, the party leader. The members of the council and the men\r\nrepresenting the Kiel government began a joint session in the evening.\r\nFour delegates of the Social-Democratic party of Kiel also attended the\r\nconference, although their party had already, at a meeting a few hours\r\nearlier, virtually decided to order a general sympathy strike.\r\n\r\nThe deliberations of the conference showed that the situation had\r\nsuddenly assumed the aspect of a strike, a mere labor and party\r\nquestion. The soldier and sailor delegates left the debate largely to\r\nthe party leaders. Both sides, government and strikers alike, showed\r\nthemselves honestly desirous of finding a peaceful settlement. The\r\ndifficulties proved, however, to be very great. At 1:00 A.M., on\r\nTuesday, the conference took a recess. Noske telegraphed to Berlin:\r\n\"Situation serious. Send me another man.\" But despite all difficulties\r\nboth sides were hopeful.\r\n\r\nOf the many thousands of mutineers, however, there were many who were\r\nnot disposed to await an orderly adjustment of the situation. Already\r\npotential masters of the squadron, they set about transmuting\r\npotentiality into actuality. On one ship after another the red flag of\r\nsedition, the emblem of the negation of loyalty to native land, replaced\r\nthe proud imperial standard. It is an amazing thing that in all Germany\r\nnot a dozen of the thousands of officers whose forefathers had for two\r\ncenturies enjoyed the privileges of an exclusive and loyal caste gave\r\ntheir lives for their King in an effort to oppose revolt and revolution.\r\nAt Kiel, and later at Hamburg, Swinemuende, Berlin--in fact,\r\neverywhere--the mutineers and revolutionaries met no resistance from the\r\nvery men of whom one might have expected that they would die, even in a\r\nforlorn cause, in obedience to the old principle of _noblesse oblige_.\r\nAt Kiel there were but three of this heroic mold. These men, whose names\r\ndeserve to be remembered and honored wherever bravery and loyalty are\r\nprized, were Commander Weniger, Captain Heinemann and Lieutenant Zenker\r\nof the battleship _Koenig_, who were shot down as, revolver in hand, they\r\ndefended the imperial standard and killed several of the men who were\r\ntrying to replace it with the red rag of revolution. Captain Heine,\r\ncommandant of the city of Kiel, was shot down in the hallway of his home\r\nTuesday evening by sailors who had come to arrest him. These four men\r\nwere the only officers deliberately shot in Kiel, except the two fatally\r\nwounded in Sunday night's fighting at the military prison.\r\n\r\nAdmiral Krafft, commander of the Kiel squadron, finally decided to leave\r\nport with his ships. But it was too late. Some of the ships had to be\r\nleft behind, for the mutineers, coming alongside in small\r\nfishing-steamers and other craft, had compelled the loyal remnants of\r\nthe crews to refuse to obey the order to accompany the squadron. Even on\r\nthe ships least affected by the mutiny, hundreds of the crews refused to\r\ncome aboard. Word of the revolt had moreover reached other coast cities,\r\nand when the ships reached Luebeck, Flensburg, Swinemuende and other\r\nports, it proved impossible to keep the missionaries of mutiny ashore\r\nand on shipboard from communicating with each other. Thus the contagion\r\nwas spread further.\r\n\r\nTuesday was a day of tense excitement at Kiel. There was some shooting,\r\ndue--as was also the case later in Berlin--to false reports that\r\nofficers had fired from houses on the mutineers. The streets were filled\r\nwith automobiles carrying red flags, and red flags began to appear over\r\nvarious buildings. Noske, feverishly active, devoting all his iron\r\nenergy to restoring order and finding a peaceful solution of the revolt,\r\nconferred continuously with representatives of the city government, with\r\nmilitary and naval authorities and with the strikers. The movement still\r\nhad outwardly only the aspect of a strike, serious indeed, but still a\r\nstrike. He succeeded in having countermanded an order bringing troops to\r\nthe city. Despite this, the suspicious mutineers compelled the Governor\r\nto go with them to the railway station in order to send the troops back\r\nif it should prove that the counterorder had not reached them in time.\r\nAt the request of the mutineers--who treated the Governor with all\r\ncourtesy--he remained at the station until the troop train arrived\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nThe situation on Tuesday was adversely affected by the flight of Prince\r\nHeinrich, brother of the Kaiser. He was not unpopular with the men of\r\nthe navy and he was never even remotely in danger. Yet he fled from Kiel\r\nin an automobile and, fleeing, destroyed the remnant of authority which\r\nhis government still enjoyed. The flight itself rendered the strikers\r\nnervous, and the fact that the death of a marine, who was shot while\r\nstanding on the step of the Prince's automobile, was at first ascribed\r\nto him, enraged the mutineers and was a further big factor in rendering\r\nnugatory the efforts of Noske and all others who were honestly striving\r\nto find a way out of the situation. Autopsy showed that the marine had\r\nbeen shot in the back by one of the bullets fired after the fleeing\r\nautomobile by the victim's own comrades. This disclosure, however, came\r\na day later, and then it was too late to undo the mischief caused by the\r\nfirst report.\r\n\r\nA \"non-resistance\" order, the first one of many that helped make the\r\nrevolution possible, was also issued on Tuesday by the military\r\nauthorities. Officers were commanded not to use force against the\r\nstrikers. \"Only mutual understanding of the demands of the moment can\r\nrestore orderly conditions,\" said the decree.\r\n\r\nWednesday, the fourth day of the revolt at Kiel, was the critical and,\r\nas it proved, the decisive day. When night came the mutineers were\r\ncrowned with victory, and the forces of orderly government had lost the\r\nday. And yet, strangely enough, neither side realized this. The strikers\r\nbelieved themselves isolated in the corner of an undisturbed empire. The\r\nmore conservative among them began to consider their situation in a\r\ndifferent light. There was an undercurrent of feeling that no help could\r\nbe looked for from other quarters and that a reconciliation with the\r\nauthorities should be sought. Noske shared this feeling. Speaking to the\r\nstriker's delegates late on Wednesday evening, he advised them to\r\ncompromise. Seek an agreement with the government, he said in effect.\r\nThe government is ready and even eager to reach a fair compromise. We\r\nstand alone, isolated.\r\n\r\nNeither Noske nor the bulk of the mutineers yet knew what had been going\r\non elsewhere in northwestern Germany. The Independent Socialist and\r\nSpartacan plotters for revolution at Berlin saw in the Kiel events the\r\nopportunity for which they had been waiting for more than three years,\r\nand they struck promptly. Haase and some of his followers went\r\nimmediately to Hamburg, and other revolutionary agents proceeded to the\r\nother coast cities to incite strikes and revolts. The ground had been so\r\nwell prepared that their efforts were everywhere speedily successful. In\r\nthe few cities where the people were not already ripe for revolution,\r\nthe supineness of the authorities made the revolutionaries' task a light\r\none. Leaders of the Kiel mutineers met the Berlin agitators in different\r\ncities and cooperated with them.\r\n\r\nThe procedure was everywhere the same. Workmen's and soldiers' councils\r\nwere formed, policemen and loyal troops were disarmed and the city\r\ngovernment was taken over by the soviets. By Thursday evening soviet\r\ngovernments had been established in Hamburg, Cuxhaven, Wilhelmshaven,\r\nBremen, Hanover, Rostock, Oldenburg and other places. The soviets in\r\nvirtually all these places were controlled by Independent\r\nSocialists--even then only a slight remove from Bolsheviki--and their\r\nspirit was hostile not alone to the existing government, but equally to\r\nthe Majority Socialists. At Hamburg, for instance, the Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Council, which had forcibly taken over the Majority Socialist\r\norgan _Hamburger Echo_ and rechristened it _Die rote Fahne_, published a\r\nproclamation forbidding the press to take any notice whatever of\r\nproclamations issued by the Majority Socialists or the leaders of\r\ntrade-unions. The proclamation declared that \"these elements will be\r\npermitted to cooperate in the government, but they will not be permitted\r\nto present any demands.\" Any attempt to interfere with the soviet was\r\ndeclared to be counter-revolutionary, and it was threatened that such\r\nattempts would \"be met with the severest repressive measures.\"\r\n\r\nThe revolution at Hamburg was marked by much shooting and general\r\nlooting. A semblance of order was restored on November 8th, but it was\r\norder only by comparison with the preceding day, and life and property\r\nwere for many days unsafe in the presence of the vicious elements in\r\ncontrol of the city. Prisoners were promiscuously released. Russian\r\nprisoners of war, proudly bearing red ribbons and flags, marched with\r\ntheir \"brothers\" in the demonstrations. A detachment of marines went to\r\nHarburg, near by, and liberated all the prisoners confined in the jail\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nThe cowardice, supineness and lack of decision of the authorities\r\ngenerally have already been referred to. A striking and characteristic\r\nillustration is furnished by the story of the revolution at Swinemuende,\r\non the Baltic Sea. Two warships, the _Dresden_ and _Augsburg_, were in\r\nthe harbor when news came of the Kiel mutiny. The admiral was Count\r\nSchwerin and one of his officers was Prince Adalbert, the sailor-son of\r\nthe Kaiser. The crews of the ships were loyal, and the Prince was\r\nespecially popular with them. The garrison at Swinemuende was composed of\r\nfifteen hundred coast artillerists and some three hundred marines. The\r\nartillerists were all men of the better class, technically educated and\r\nthoroughly loyal. At a word from their commanding-officer they would\r\nhave blown any mutinous ship out of the water with their heavy coast\r\nguns. And yet Admiral Count Schwerin and Prince Adalbert donned civilian\r\nclothing and took refuge with civilian friends ashore.\r\n\r\nThirty-six submarines arrived at five o'clock in the afternoon, but left\r\ntwo hours later because there was no food to be had at Swinemuende. The\r\ncoast artillerists begged to be allowed to wipe out the mutineers. The\r\nmayor of Swinemuende protested. Shells from the sea, he said, might fall\r\ninto the city and damage it. And so, under the guns of loyal men, the\r\nsailors looted the ships completely during the evening and night.\r\n\r\nA committee of three marines called on Major Grunewald, commander of the\r\nfortress, and insolently ordered him to direct the garrison to appoint a\r\nsoldiers' council. The artillerists were dumfounded when the major\r\ncomplied. The council appointed consisted of three marines, one\r\nartillerist and one infantryman, of whom there were about a hundred in\r\nthe garrison. One of the members was an officer, Major Grunewald having\r\nbeen ordered to direct the appointment of one. When the council had been\r\nformed the troops were drawn up to listen to a speech by a sergeant of\r\nmarines. The major, his head bared, listened obediently.\r\n\r\n\"We are the masters here now,\" said the sergeant. \"It is ours to\r\ncommand, yours to obey. The salute is abolished. When we meet a decent\r\nofficer we may possibly say 'good day, major,' to him, but when we meet\r\nsome little runt (_Schnoesel_) of a lieutenant we shan't recognize him.\r\nThe officers may now go to their quarters. We don't need them. If we\r\nshould need them later we shall tell them.\"[27]\r\n\r\n[27] The flight of Prince Heinrich and later of the Kaiser made a\r\n    painful impression in Germany, especially among Germans of\r\n    the better class, and did much to alienate sympathy from\r\n    them. It had been thought that, whatever other faults the\r\n    Hohenzollerns might possess, they were at least not cowards.\r\n    The flight of Prince Adalbert is even today not generally\r\n    known.\r\n\r\nThe government at Berlin and the Majority Socialists endeavored, even\r\nafter the events already recorded, to stem the tide, or at least to\r\nlead the movement into more orderly channels. Stolten and Quarck,\r\nSocialist Reichstag deputies, and Blunck, Progressive deputy, and\r\nStubbe and Schumann, Socialists, representing the executive committee\r\nof the central labor federation, went to Hamburg. But Haase, Ledebour\r\nand the other agitators had done their work too well. Thursday morning\r\nbrought the reports of the successes of the uprisings to the mutineers\r\nat Kiel, who were on the point of returning to their ships. A\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Council was formed for the whole province of\r\nSchleswig-Holstein. The revolt had already become revolution. The\r\nrevolutionaries seized the railway running from Hamburg to Berlin, and\r\nalso took charge of telephonic and telegraphic communication. Their\r\nemissaries started for Berlin.\r\n\r\nIt has been set forth in a previous chapter that the promise of\r\nPresident Wilson to give the Germans a just peace on the basis of his\r\nfourteen points and the supplementary points, and his declaration that\r\nthe war was against a system and not against the German people\r\nthemselves had played a very considerable part in making the revolution\r\npossible. This appears clearly in the report of the events at Bremen. On\r\nNovember 7th a procession, estimated at thirty thousand persons, passed\r\nthrough the city and halted at the market place. A number of speeches\r\nwere made. One of the chief speakers, a soldier, reminded his hearers\r\nthat Wilson had said that a peace of justice was possible for the\r\nGermans only if they would take the government into their own hands.\r\nThis had now been done, and nobody could reproach the revolutionaries\r\nwith being unpatriotic, since their acts had made a just peace possible.\r\n\r\nA similar address was made at a meeting of the revolutionaries in\r\nHanover, where the speaker told his hearers that the salvation of\r\nGermany depended upon their loyal support of the revolution, which had\r\nplaced all power in the hands of the people and fulfilled the conditions\r\nprecedent entitling them to such a peace as the President had promised\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt the request of the government Noske assumed the post of Governor of\r\nKiel. Order was restored. The relations between the mutineers and their\r\nformer officers were strikingly good. The spirit of the Majority\r\nSocialists prevailed. Not until the Berlin revolution had put the seal\r\nupon their work did the mutineers of Kiel realize that it was they who\r\nhad started the revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n                     The Revolution Reaches Berlin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first news of the Kiel revolt reached Berlin on November 5th, when\r\nthe morning papers published a half-column article giving a fairly\r\naccurate story of the happenings of Sunday, November 3d. The report\r\nended:\r\n\r\n    \"By eight o'clock the street\" (Karlstrasse, where the firing\r\n    occurred) \"was clear. Only a few pools of blood and numerous\r\n    shattered windows in the nearby buildings gave evidence that\r\n    there had been sad happenings here. The late evening and the\r\n    night were quiet. Excited groups stood about the street corners\r\n    until midnight, but they remained passive. Reinforced patrols\r\n    passed through the city, which otherwise appeared as usual. All\r\n    public places are open and the performances in the theaters were\r\n    not interrupted.\"\r\n\r\nThe papers of the following day announced that \"official reports\r\nconcerning the further course of events in Kiel and other cities in\r\nNorth Germany had not been made public here up to noon. We are thus for\r\nthe moment unable to give a report concerning them.\"\r\n\r\nThis was but half the truth. The capital was already filled with\r\nreports, and the government was by this time fully informed of what was\r\ngoing on. Rumors and travelers' tales passed from mouth to mouth, but\r\neven yet the movement was not considered directly revolutionary, nor,\r\nindeed, was it revolutionary, although it became so within the next\r\ntwenty-four hours. The executive committee of the German Federation of\r\nLabor published a declaration regarding \"the recent spreading of\r\nanonymous handbills summoning laborers to strikes and disorders for\r\npolitical ends.\" It was also reported by the press that Kurt Eisner, who\r\nhad been released from prison by the October amnesty, had made a violent\r\nrevolutionary speech at a meeting of the Independent Socialists in\r\nMunich. A further significant newspaper item complained of the\r\ndistribution in Germany of vast quantities of revolutionary literature\r\nprinted in Sweden and Denmark and smuggled across the Danish border.\r\n\r\nJoffe, convicted of abusing his privileges as a diplomat and of lying,\r\nhad been escorted to a special train, together with his staff, and\r\nheaded for Russia. With him went the Berlin representatives of the Rosta\r\nTelegraph Agency. But it was too late. Not only had the mischief already\r\nbeen done, but the loyalist Germans had also been disgusted with the\r\ngovernment's timorous failure to grasp this nettle earlier and the\r\nIndependent Socialists and their Spartacan soul-brothers were still\r\nfurther enraged, if possible, by the expulsion and the manner in which\r\nit was carried out.\r\n\r\nIt is doubtful whether the government even yet realized that it had an\r\nembryo revolution to deal with. A more homogeneous government, composed\r\nof men with executive as well as legislative experience, would have\r\nrealized it, but homogeneity and executive experience were sadly lacking\r\nin this cabinet. It is significant that the experienced men at the head\r\nof the political police had already begun preparations to crush any\r\nuprising and had burned certain archives which they did not desire to\r\nhave fall into the hands of revolutionary elements. The government was\r\nalso embarrassed by the uncertain attitude of the Majority Socialists.\r\nOstensibly these did not desire the overthrow of the monarchy, but\r\nmerely of the Kaiser; Scheidemann had declared in so many words that his\r\nparty, despite the fact that it had always striven for an eventual\r\nrepublic, was willing to wait for such a development and was for the\r\npresent not opposed to the maintaining of a constitutional monarchy. As\r\nlate as November 8th Scheidemann told von Payer that the Socialists did\r\nnot insist on the abolition of the monarchy.\r\n\r\nThere were even Socialists who did not desire the Kaiser's abdication.\r\nHerr Marum, a Socialist member of the Baden Diet, in a speech at the end\r\nof October, had warned his hearers that any attempt to depose the Kaiser\r\nwould bring chaos and imperil the state. He declared that the\r\noverwhelming majority of Germans were still monarchists, and although\r\nthe Socialists were advocates of a republic, that question was now\r\nsubordinate. The Kaiser, said Marum, had, in common with all Germans,\r\nlearned much, and it would be a great risk to try to force a republic\r\nupon an unwilling majority. Dr. Dietz, a Socialist city councillor,\r\nseconded Marum, and expressed indignation at any efforts to make a\r\nscapegoat of the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nThe Wednesday evening papers published a note from Lansing, wherein it\r\nwas stated that the allied nations accepted Wilson's fourteen points of\r\nJanuary 8, 1918, and the supplementary points enunciated in the Mount\r\nVernon speech, except that relating to the freedom of the seas. The\r\nGerman delegation \"for the conclusion of an armistice and to begin peace\r\nnegotiations\" left Berlin for the west. It was composed of General von\r\nGuendell, General von Winterfeldt, Admiral Meurer and Admiral von Hintze.\r\n\r\nThursday, November 7th, brought more reassuring news from Kiel. The\r\nofficial Wolff Bureau reported:\r\n\r\n    \"The military protection of the Baltic by the marine is\r\n    completely reestablished. All departing warships carry the\r\n    war-flag. The movement among the sailors and workmen has taken a\r\n    quieter course. The soldiers of the garrison are endeavoring to\r\n    take measures against violations of order. A gradual general\r\n    surrender of weapons is proceeding. Private houses and business\r\n    places, as well as lazarets and hospitals, are unmolested.\r\n    Nearly all banks are doing business. The provisioning in the\r\n    barracks and on the ships is being carried out in the usual\r\n    manner. The furnishing of provisions to the civilian population\r\n    has not been interfered with. The strike at the factories\r\n    continues. The people are quiet.\"\r\n\r\nReports from other coast cities were less favorable. Wolff reported:\r\n\r\n    \"In Hamburg there is a strike in the factories. Breaches of\r\n    discipline and violent excesses have occurred. The same is\r\n    reported from Luebeck. Except for excesses in certain works,\r\n    private property has not been damaged nor touched. The\r\n    population is in no danger.\"\r\n\r\nChancellor Prince Max issued a proclamation, declaring that Germany's\r\nenemies had accepted Wilson's program, except as to the freedom of the\r\nseas. \"This,\" he said, \"forms the necessary preliminary condition for\r\npeace negotiations and at the same time for armistice negotiations.\" He\r\ndeclared that a delegation had already been sent to the west front, but\r\n\"the successful conduct of negotiations is gravely jeopardized by\r\ndisturbances and undisciplined conduct.\" The Chancellor recalled the\r\nprivations endured by the people for more than four years and appealed\r\nto them to hold out a little longer and maintain order.\r\n\r\nThe situation was, however, already lost. If Scheidemann, Ebert and\r\ntheir fellow members in the central committee of the Majority Socialist\r\norganization had had their followers in hand the revolution could\r\nprobably still have been prevented, or at least transformed into an\r\norderly dethroning of the Kaiser and institution of parliamentary\r\nreforms. But they did not have them in hand, and the result was that\r\n_Vorwaerts_, the party's central organ, published in its morning issue a\r\nfurther demand for the Kaiser's abdication. _Vorwaerts_ declared that his\r\nsufferings could not be compared to those of most German fathers and\r\nthat the sacrifice he was called upon to make was comparatively small.\r\nThe appearance of this article was followed a few hours later by an\r\nultimatum to the government, demanding that the Kaiser abdicate within\r\ntwenty-four hours and declaring that if he failed to do so, the\r\nSocialists would withdraw from the government. It is probable that\r\nScheidemann, Ebert and some of the other leaders of the party presented\r\nthe ultimatum with reluctance, realizing what it would involve, but they\r\nwere helpless in the face of the sentiment of the mass of their party\r\nand of the attitude of the Independent Socialists.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the Kaiser toward abdication was already known to them.\r\nFollowing Scheidemann's demand a week earlier, Dr. Drews, the Minister\r\nof the Interior, had submitted the demand to the Kaiser. Scheidemann had\r\ndeclared that, if the Kaiser did not abdicate, the Independent\r\nSocialists would demand the introduction of a republic, in which case\r\nthe Majority Socialists would be compelled to make common cause with\r\nthem. The Kaiser, doubtless still convinced of the loyalty of the\r\ntroops, was not moved by Drews's report. He declared that his abdication\r\nwould mean complete anarchy and the delivering of Germany into the hands\r\nof the Bolsheviki. He could not accept the responsibility for such a\r\nstep. That Scheidemann and Ebert, although they were cognizant of the\r\nKaiser's attitude, consented to Thursday's ultimatum gives color to a\r\nreport that informal negotiations had in the meantime been carried on\r\nbetween them and certain Independent leaders.[28]\r\n\r\n[28] These negotiations had nothing to do with a revolution as\r\n    such, nor with the formation of soviets. It must be\r\n    emphasized that the Majority Socialists still had no part in\r\n    these plans and were themselves surprised by the events of\r\n    Friday evening and Saturday.\r\n\r\nRevolution was now fairly on the march. The Independent Socialists and\r\nLiebknecht's Spartacans were already endeavoring to form a Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Council for Greater Berlin. General von Linsingen, commander\r\nin the Marches, made a last desperate attempt to forbid the revolution\r\nby issuing the following decree:\r\n\r\n    \"In certain quarters there exists the purpose to form Workmen's\r\n    and Soldiers' Councils after the Russian pattern, in disregard\r\n    of the provisions of the laws.\r\n\r\n    \"Institutions of this kind conflict with the existing state\r\n    order and endanger the public safety.\r\n\r\n    \"Under paragraph 9b of the law regarding a state of siege I\r\n    forbid any formation of such associations and the participation\r\n    therein.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the last order issued by the military authorities in Berlin. A\r\ncounterpiece was the last anti-revolutionary order issued by the old\r\npolice authorities, which forbade eight mass meetings which the\r\nIndependent Socialists proposed to hold Thursday evening, with \"The\r\nAnniversary of the Russian Revolution\" as their theme. The police order,\r\nhowever, was enforced.\r\n\r\nThe first revolutionary emissaries reached Berlin Thursday evening, in\r\nthe form of various detachments of armed marines from Hamburg. The\r\nmilitary authorities, more resolute than those in the provincial cities,\r\nsent troops to the railway station to receive them. The marines suffered\r\nthemselves to be disarmed and went without resistance to barracks, with\r\nthe exception of one detachment of about two hundred and fifty men, of\r\nwhom all but some seventy escaped into the streets with their weapons.\r\nThese men formed the nucleus of the revolution in Berlin.\r\n\r\nBerlin was still without any but the most meager news of the\r\nrevolution Friday. The papers complained of an even more\r\nnarrow-minded and arbitrary censorship by the new government than\r\nthat under the old regime. The press was on the whole restricted\r\nto printing official reports, although some of them added a few\r\nparagraphs of explanatory comment. An inspired report that the\r\nexcesses in the northwest bore no political character was contradicted\r\nby the _Vorwaerts_, which declared that they had a \"liberty seeking\r\nsocialistic character everywhere.\" Unimportant disturbances took place\r\nduring the day in Rosenthalerstrasse, in the old city, and a few arrests\r\nwere made, but the day passed quietly on the whole.\r\n\r\nCrowds stood in front of the bulletin boards of the various newspapers\r\nall day, waiting for news from Grand Headquarters. Would the Kaiser\r\nabdicate? The term of the Socialist ultimatum expired. Scheidemann gave\r\nnotice that the party would wait another twenty-four hours, and a few\r\nhours later the term was extended until after the decision regarding the\r\narmistice, the terms of which were expected to reach Berlin on Saturday.\r\n\r\nThe government, weak, irresolute, inexperienced, faced a situation which\r\nwould have confounded stronger men. A day earlier they had consented to\r\nsummon from Kiel and Hamburg about a thousand marines who were supposed\r\nto be devoted to Noske. This attempt to cast out the Devil with\r\nBeelzebub indicates in some degree the desperateness of the situation.\r\nMore troops were brought to the capital on Friday. They were the\r\nNaumburg _Jaeger_ (sharpshooters) and the Luebben _Jaeger_, excellent\r\ntroops, who had been in the Finland contingent, had distinguished\r\nthemselves by patriotic daring and exemplary discipline, and who were\r\nconsidered absolutely reliable. These men, about four thousand in all,\r\nwere in part quartered in different large restaurants and in part in the\r\nbarracks of the Alexander Regiment. It was in these barracks that\r\n(ironic coincidence!) Kaiser Wilhelm made his well-known speech on March\r\n28, 1901, in which he asserted his confidence that, if the Berliners\r\nshould again become \"insolent and disobedient\" (_frech und unbotmaessig_)\r\nas in 1848, his troops would know how to protect their imperial master.\r\nIn all there were perhaps twenty thousand soldiers in Berlin at this\r\ntime, including several regiments of the Prussian Guard.\r\n\r\nThroughout Thursday and Friday the Independent Socialists were\r\nfeverishly active. Liebknecht, \"Red Rosa\" Luxemburg and other Spartacans\r\njoined the Independent agitators in revolutionary propaganda among the\r\nsoldiers and in making preparations for the final coup. The police,\r\nloyal and alert to the last, arrested Daeumig on a charge of high treason\r\nand closed the central bureau of the Independent Socialist party. Again\r\ntoo late! There were plenty left to carry on the work. The Majority\r\nSocialists, or at least their leaders, knew in a general way of the\r\nactivities of these revolutionary forces, but they were still ignorant\r\nof the details.\r\n\r\nPrince Max telegraphed the Kaiser, offering to resign. The Kaiser asked\r\nhim to remain in office for the time being at least.\r\n\r\nFriday night the Berlin Workmen's and Soldiers' Council was organized at\r\na meeting summoned by Barth, Haase and other Independents. In addition\r\nto the Independents and Spartacans at the meeting, there were a number\r\nof more or less well-known men who had not theretofore been identified\r\nwith these parties. One of them, a man who was to play a prominent role\r\nin the events of Saturday, the day of the real revolution, was\r\nLieutenant Colin Ross, a prominent journalist and war correspondent.\r\nAnother was Captain von Beerfelde. It was von Beerfelde who, at that\r\ntime a member of the General Staff, betrayed a friend's confidence by\r\nmaking public the Lichnowsky memorandum. This resulted, quite naturally,\r\nin his arrest and imprisonment. The government could not have acted\r\notherwise, but there is no doubt that von Beerfelde was subjected to\r\nunnecessary indignities during his arrest, and these, in connection with\r\nthe arrest itself, transformed the somewhat unbalanced and egotistic man\r\ninto a bitter enemy of all existing institutions. The General Staff was\r\nfurther represented at Friday night's meeting by First Lieutenant\r\nTibertius, a man of no particular prominence or importance, who came to\r\nthe meeting in company with the Independent leaders. Barth had bought\r\nsome sixteen hundred revolvers with money given him by Joffe, and these\r\nwere distributed at the meeting and outside, to soldiers and civilians\r\nalike. Barth presided at the meeting, which was held in the Reichstag\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists now saw the hopelessness of keeping apart from\r\nthe movement. They declared their solidarity with the Independents, and,\r\nin the few hours that remained, set about trying to save whatever could\r\nbe saved out of the wreck which was plainly coming.\r\n\r\nFriday night, despite these occurrences, passed quietly. The streets\r\nwere unusually crowded until after midnight, but it was mainly a curious\r\ncrowd, awaiting further news, particularly of the Kaiser's expected\r\nabdication. The royal palace was strongly cordoned by steel-helmeted\r\ntroops, a searchlight played from the tower of the city hall and the\r\nstreets of the old city were well patrolled by troops and policemen. The\r\npolice chiefs of various municipalities of Greater Berlin conferred with\r\nGeneral von Linsingen on ways and means of meeting eventual\r\ndisturbances. They decided that further military forces were not needed.\r\n\r\nSaturday, revolution day, dawned with the great mass of the inhabitants\r\nstill ignorant of the events of the preceding days. The coming events\r\nnevertheless cast their shadows before. The morning papers reported that\r\nthe Kaiser's son-in-law, Duke Ernest August of Brunswick, had abdicated\r\nafter an eleventh-hour attempt to stem the tide by a decree for\r\nfranchise reform. It was also evident that the Kaiser must go, for the\r\nClericals, National Liberals and Progressives in the government\r\npermitted it to be reported that, while they were still supporters of a\r\nmonarchical form of government, they had, in view of the extraordinary\r\ncircumstances, decided that personal considerations must be disregarded.\r\n\r\nThe Wolff Bureau was forced to admit that the revolt that started at\r\nKiel had extended to many other places in the Empire. The report said:\r\n\r\n    \"A certain carefully planned procedure is now disclosing itself.\r\n    Everywhere the same picture: from the chief centers, Kiel and\r\n    Hamburg, trains carrying armed marines and agitators are being\r\n    sent out into the country. These men endeavor to seize the\r\n    centers of communication and abolish the military commands. They\r\n    then attach to themselves criminal elements, among whom there\r\n    are great numbers of deserters, and endeavor to corrupt the\r\n    troops by representing to them that it is not a question of a\r\n    revolutionary movement, but one to secure military reforms. The\r\n    attempt has been successful with many troops, but it has met\r\n    energetic resistance from others. The whole movement plainly\r\n    proceeds from Russia, and it is proved that the former members\r\n    of the Berlin representation of the Soviet republic have\r\n    cooperated in it. As the Russian Government has itself admitted,\r\n    it hopes by this means to cause Bolshevist ideas to spring into\r\n    new life here in Germany and thereafter in all Europe.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first open admission that the Kiel revolt had developed\r\ninto a revolution. The newspapers were permitted also to publish reports\r\nfrom various water-front cities, showing that the Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Councils were in power in Bremen, Hamburg, Luebeck, Kiel and\r\nother places, and that these councils \"are in charge of the government\r\nin nearly all garrisons in the province of Holstein.\" They were also\r\npermitted to report the proclamation of the republic in Bavaria, and the\r\ncomplete text of Kurt Eisner's bombastic address to the people. It was\r\nreported from Frankfort-on-Main that General von Studnitz, commander in\r\nthat city, had ordered all garrisons there to hold meetings on Friday\r\nevening for the formation of soldiers' councils. This action followed\r\nrepresentations from Frankfort's Majority Socialists, acting in concert\r\nwith the Progressives.\r\n\r\nNowhere, however, was any mention made of Friday night's events in\r\nBerlin itself. The papers published articles couched in general terms,\r\nwarning all citizens to preserve order, and reminding them that the\r\ncity's provisioning would be gravely disturbed by disorders. In fact,\r\nthe daily supply of milk had already dropped ninety thousand liters as a\r\nresult of the \"sudden interruption of railway traffic.\"\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists had summoned a meeting for the early morning of\r\nSaturday in the Reichstag building. They had been in session only a\r\nshort time when the news came that a large parade of workingmen was\r\nproceeding down the Chausseestrasse. This was about 9:00 A.M. The parade\r\nwas largely made up of employees from the Schwartzkopff works, which had\r\nbeen for two years a hotbed of discontent, of radical socialism and\r\nBolshevism. The marchers entered the barracks of the Fusilier\r\nGuards--known in Berlin and North Germany generally as the\r\n_Maikaefer_--and demanded that the soldiers surrender their weapons. A\r\ncaptain, the first officer encountered, shot down four of the rioters\r\nbefore he was himself killed. He was the only officer in Berlin rash,\r\nbrave and loyal enough to give his life deliberately for his monarch and\r\nfor the old system. The soldiers then meekly surrendered their rifles\r\nand the parade moved on, reinforced in every street with deserters,\r\ncriminals, hooligans and other undesirable elements such as are to be\r\nfound in all large cities.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists realized that their only hope was to try to lead\r\nthe movement and direct it into comparatively orderly channels. They\r\nappointed Scheidemann, Ebert and David to confer with the Independent\r\nSocialist delegates Dittmann, Vogtherr and Ledebour, regarding the\r\norganization of a new government.\r\n\r\nFurther reports came of street demonstrations. Bloodshed appeared\r\nimminent. Colin Ross went to the palace of the Chancellor and found\r\nPrince Max. The Prince was nervous and all but entirely unstrung. Ross\r\ntold him the Majority Socialists had decided that there must be no\r\nfiring on the people, and asked him to issue an order to that effect.\r\nMax said he would do so. Ross thereupon went to Minister of War Scheuch\r\nand told him that the Chancellor had ordered that the troops should not\r\nfire on the citizens. The order was communicated to the various\r\ngarrisons and also to police headquarters.\r\n\r\nWhat would have occurred if this order had not been issued is a matter\r\nof conjecture. Assuredly there would have been bloodshed. Quite apart\r\nfrom the question of the reliability or unreliability of the troops\r\nthere were the Berlin police to deal with. Their ranks had been thinned\r\nby calls to the front, but those still on duty were no inconsiderable\r\nfactor. The force was made up entirely of veteran non-commissioned\r\nofficers, who must have served twelve years in the army. They were,\r\nmoreover, like all great city police forces, picked men, above the\r\naverage physically, and far above the average in bravery, resoluteness\r\nand loyalty. Only a negligible number of them had been perverted by red\r\ndoctrines, and they were well armed and fully prepared for the day's\r\nevents. High police officials assured the author that they could have\r\nput down the revolution in its very beginnings if the order had not come\r\nforbidding them to offer resistance.\r\n\r\nViewed in the light of subsequent events, this statement must be\r\nrejected. The police could and would have put up a brave battle, but\r\nthere were too few of them for one thing, and for another, the\r\nrevolution had too great momentum to be stopped by any force available\r\nto the authorities. One military defection had already occurred when\r\nSaturday dawned. A corporal of the Naumburg _Jaeger_, who were quartered\r\nin the Alexander barracks, had been arrested for making an incendiary\r\nspeech to some comrades, and when the troops were alarmed at 3:00 A.M.\r\nand ordered to be ready to go into action they refused to obey. Major\r\nOtt, commander of the battalion directly affected, came and told the men\r\nthat the Kaiser had already abdicated. They sent a delegation to the\r\n_Vorwaerts_, where they learned that the major's statement was not true.\r\nThe delegation thereupon announced that the battalion would place itself\r\non the side of the workingmen. The Kaiser Alexander Guards followed the\r\n_Jaeger's_ example.\r\n\r\nThere were some good troops in Berlin--such as the _Jaeger_ already\r\nmentioned--but the great majority of the men were by no means of the\r\nhighest standard. The best troops were naturally at the front, and those\r\nat home were in large part made up of men who had been away from the\r\nfiring-line for some weeks or even longer, and who had been subjected to\r\na violent campaign of what the Socialists call _Aufklaerung_, literally,\r\nclearing up, or enlightenment. The word is generally used as part of a\r\nphrase, _Aufklaerung im sozial-demokratischen Sinne_, that is,\r\n\"enlightenment in the social-democratic sense.\" The great majority of\r\nany army is made up of men who work with their hands. A great part of\r\nthe others consists of small shopkeepers, clerks and others whose\r\nassociations in civilian life are mainly with the workingmen. An appeal\r\nnot to shoot one's \"proletarian brother\" is, in the nature of things, an\r\nappeal which strikes home to these people. The Kaiser was still\r\nnominally occupying the throne, but it was certain that he would\r\nabdicate. This was a further element of weakness for the government,\r\nsince such of the troops as were still _kaisertreu_ (loyal to the\r\nKaiser) saw themselves about to be deprived of their monarch, who,\r\nhowever they may have regarded him personally, nevertheless represented\r\nfor them the majesty and unity of the German State. Hence, even before\r\nthe order came not to fire on the people, the troops had begun to place\r\nthemselves on the side of the revolutionaries and were everywhere\r\npermitting themselves to be disarmed. Otto Wels, a Majority Socialist\r\nmember of the Reichstag, and others of his colleagues made the round of\r\nthe barracks, appealing to the soldiers not to shed their brothers'\r\nblood. And then came the no-resistance order.\r\n\r\nThe streets filled with marching crowds, civilians and soldiers, arm in\r\narm, cheering and singing. Hawkers appeared everywhere with small red\r\nflags, red rosettes, red ribbons, red flowers. The red flag of\r\nrevolution began breaking out on various buildings. Soldiers tore off\r\ntheir regimental insignia and removed the cockades from their caps.\r\nFactories were deserted.\r\n\r\nThe revolution had come!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n                         The Kaiser Abdicates.\r\n\r\n\r\nEvents moved with lightning rapidity. All that has been related in the\r\nforegoing chapter concerning the developments of November 9th had\r\nhappened before 11:00 A.M. The Majority Socialists, still in session in\r\nthe Reichstag and now in complete fellowship with the Independents and\r\nmembers of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council, decided that the\r\nrepublic must be proclaimed. Some enterprising individuals prepared an\r\nArticle reporting the Kaiser's abdication. Ross took it to the\r\n_Vorwaerts_, which published it in an extra edition, nearly two hours\r\nbefore the abdication actually took place. The paper was fairly torn\r\nfrom the hands of the venders in the streets, and processions of\r\nred-ribboned marchers became more frequent.\r\n\r\nThe cabinet had meanwhile been in almost constant telephonic\r\ncommunication with the Kaiser. It had been repeatedly represented to him\r\nthat only his abdication could prevent rioting and bloodshed. But the\r\ndecision which he was called upon to make was not an easy one, and it\r\ncannot be wondered that he hesitated. He was particularly insistent\r\nthat, while he could consider abdicating as German Emperor, he could not\r\nand would not abdicate as King of Prussia. The decision had still not\r\nbeen reached at noon. The cabinet, fearing to delay longer, had the\r\nfollowing report sent out by the Wolff Bureau:\r\n\r\n    \"The Kaiser and King has decided to surrender the throne (_dem\r\n    Throne zu entsagen_). The Imperial Chancellor will remain in\r\n    office until the questions connected with the abdication of the\r\n    Kaiser, the abandoning by the Crown Prince of the German Empire\r\n    and Prussia of his rights to the throne, and the installation of\r\n    a regency shall have been adjusted. It is his intention to\r\n    propose to the regent the appointment of Deputy Ebert as\r\n    Imperial Chancellor and to submit to him a draft of a measure\r\n    regarding the immediate calling of general elections for a\r\n    constituent German national assembly, which shall finally\r\n    determine the future form of government of the German people,\r\n    and also of those peoples that may desire to be included within\r\n    the borders of the Empire.\r\n\r\n                                  (signed) \"The Imperial Chancellor,\r\n                                             \"Max, Prince of Baden.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this, so far from being the proclamation of a\r\nrepublic, clearly contemplated the continued existence of the monarchy.\r\nThe question of the future form of government was, it is true, to be\r\nleft to the national assembly, but if the events of Saturday afternoon\r\nand Sunday had not occurred it is probable that this assembly would have\r\ndecided upon a constitutional monarchy. Speculations along this line are\r\nof merely academic interest, but for a better understanding of the\r\nextent of the reversal of these two days it may be pointed out that a\r\nclear majority of the German people was undoubtedly monarchic in\r\nprinciple. The only body of republican opinion was represented by the\r\nSocial-Democrats of both wings, who composed less than forty per cent of\r\nthe total population, and even among them, as we have seen, there were\r\nmen who felt that the time had not yet come for a republic.\r\n\r\nPrince Max's proclamation anticipated by a full hour the Kaiser's actual\r\nabdication. It was furthermore erroneous in its assertion that \"the\r\nKing\" had abdicated. The Kaiser's first abdication did not include the\r\nroyal throne of Prussia. Only when all hope was definitely lost did he\r\nsurrender this.\r\n\r\nA detachment of _Jaeger_ occupied the Reichstag, and a great crowd\r\ngathered outside. Scheidemann, in an address from the Reichstag steps,\r\ntold the crowd that the dynasty had been overthrown, and that Ebert had\r\nbeen appointed to form a new government on republican lines and with the\r\nparticipation of all political parties.[29] Scheidemann, like Max, also\r\nanticipated events, for the republic had not yet been authoritatively\r\nproclaimed, nor had Ebert been appointed Chancellor.\r\n\r\n[29] The Majority Socialists honestly intended to form a people's\r\n    government representing all parties. That only Socialists\r\n    were eventually admitted was due to the flat refusal of the\r\n    Independents to let the despised _bourgeoisie_ have any voice\r\n    whatever in the governmental affairs.\r\n\r\nTwo hours later, shortly after 2:00 P.M., Ebert, Scheidemann, Braun and\r\ntwo members of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council, Prolat and Hiller,\r\nwent to the palace of the Chancellor in an automobile carrying a red\r\nflag and guarded by armed soldiers. They informed Prince Max that they\r\nconsidered it absolutely necessary to form a socialistic government,[30]\r\nsince this alone could save Germany. The Prince thereupon requested\r\nEbert to accept the chancellorship. Ebert complied and thus became for\r\none day \"Imperial Chancellor,\" the possessor of an office which did not\r\nexist in an empire which no longer existed.\r\n\r\n[30] \"Socialistic\" in a non-partisan sense; a republic based on\r\n    the Socialist party's tenets, but not necessarily conducted\r\n    exclusively by them. The exclusion of the _bourgeoisie_ was a\r\n    later idea.\r\n\r\nEbert's first act was to proclaim the republic officially. He did this\r\nin an address to a crowd which filled Wilhelmstrasse and Wilhelmplatz in\r\nfront of the Chancellor's official residence. Hysteric cheering followed\r\nthe announcement that the German Empire had become history.\r\n\r\nThe greatest revolution of all times was an accomplished fact before\r\nthree o'clock on Saturday afternoon, November 9th. The old system, with\r\nits tens of thousands of trained and specialized officials; with armies\r\nthat had successfully fought for years against the combined resources of\r\nthe rest of the world; with citizens trained from their very infancy to\r\nreverence the Kaiser and to obey those in authority; with the moral\r\nsupport of the monarchic Germans, who far outnumbered the\r\nrepublican--this system fell as a rotten tree falls before a gale. The\r\nsimile lacks in perfection because the tree falls with a crash, whereas\r\nthe old German governmental system made less noise in its collapse than\r\ndid the Kingdom of Portugal some years earlier. It simply disappeared.\r\n_Fuit Germania_.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the Majority Socialists, by stealing the thunder of the\r\nIndependents and acting with a good deal of resolution, had kept\r\nthemselves in the center of the stage. The real makers of the\r\nrevolution, the Independents and Spartacans, had been confined to\r\noff-stage work. It was Liebknecht, with his instinct for the theatrical\r\nand dramatic, who now came to the front. A vast crowd had gathered\r\naround the royal palace. It was made up in part of the \"class-conscious\r\nproletariat,\" but in large part also of the merely curious. Liebknecht,\r\naccompanied by Adolf Hoffmann[31] and another left wing Socialist,\r\nentered the palace and proceeded to a balcony in the second story,\r\nwhere, lacking a red flag, he hung a red bed-blanket over the rail of\r\nthe balcony and then delivered an impassioned harangue to the crowd\r\nbelow. The real revolution, he declared, had only begun, and attempts at\r\ncounter-revolution could be met only by the vigilance of an armed\r\nproletariat. The working-classes must arm themselves, the _bourgeoisie_\r\nmust be disarmed. Hoffmann, who spoke briefly, said that he was enjoying\r\nthe happiest and proudest moment of his life. While he was still\r\nspeaking a red flag was hoisted over the palace, to the cheers of the\r\npeople gathered around the building.\r\n\r\n[31] Hoffman was for several years a member of the Prussian Diet\r\n    and prominent in the councils of the Social-Democratic party.\r\n    Although a professed atheist and unable to write a sentence\r\n    of his mother-tongue without an error in spelling or grammar,\r\n    he became under the first revolutionary government Prussian\r\n    Minister of Education (_Kultusminister_), with charge over\r\n    the church and schools. Hoffman left the old party at the\r\n    time of the split in 1915, and has since been an abusive and\r\n    virulent enemy of his former colleagues. He distinguished\r\n    himself in the Diet chiefly by disregard of the ordinary\r\n    amenities of civilized intercourse and parliamentary forms.\r\n    Speaking from the speaker's rostrum in the Diet, with his\r\n    back to the presiding-officer--after the usual European\r\n    custom--he would utter some insult to the royal house, the\r\n    authorities in general, one of the _bourgeois_ parties of the\r\n    house or one of the members. He appeared to know\r\n    instinctively whenever his remarks were inadmissible, for he\r\n    would pause, hunch up his shoulders like one expecting to be\r\n    struck from behind, and wait for the presiding-officer to\r\n    ring his bell and call him to order. A few minutes later the\r\n    same scene would be reenacted.\r\n\r\nSome of the palace guard had given up their rifles and left their posts.\r\nOthers had joined the revolutionaries. The looting of the palace began.\r\nIt did not assume great proportions on this first day, but many valuable\r\nArticles had disappeared when night came. Government property of all\r\nkinds was sold openly in the streets by soldiers and civilians. Rifles\r\ncould be had for a few marks, and even army automobiles were sold for\r\nfrom three to five hundred marks. Processions kept moving about the\r\ncity, made up in part of soldiers and in part of armed civilians.\r\nPersons without red badges were often molested or mishandled. Cockades\r\nin the imperial or some state's colors were torn from soldiers' caps,\r\ntheir shoulder insignia were ripped off and their belts taken away by\r\nthe embryo and self-constituted \"red guard.\" The patriotic cockades\r\ninflamed their revolutionary hearts; the belts, being of good leather--a\r\nrare article--could be used for repairing the shoes of the faithful.\r\nOfficers were hunted down, their shoulder-straps torn off and their\r\nswords and revolvers taken from them. Many officers were roughly\r\nhandled. Hundreds escaped a like fate by a quick change into civilian\r\nclothing. The _mobile vulgus_ had forgotten that forty per cent of\r\nGermany's active officer corps had been killed in fighting for their\r\ncountry, and that a great part of those left were crippled by wounds. It\r\nsaw in these men only the representatives of an iron discipline and of\r\nauthority--and authority is hated by all truly class-conscious\r\n_Genossen_. It was this same feeling that led, on the following day, to\r\nthe disarming of the police--a measure which so quickly avenged itself\r\nin an increase of crime from which even the proletariat suffered that\r\ntheir sabers and revolvers were restored to the police within a month.\r\n\r\nThus far the revolution had been all but bloodless. The brave officer of\r\nthe _Maikaefer_ and the four revolutionaries who fell before him were the\r\nonly victims. But about 6:00 P.M., as an automobile ambulance turned\r\ninto the palace courtyard, a single shot was heard. Observers thought\r\nthey saw the smoke of the shot in the central entrance to the royal\r\nstables, which are situated across the street just south of the palace.\r\nWhile the source of the shot was being investigated a second shot was\r\nfired. Almost immediately machine guns began firing from the cellar\r\nwindows and the first and second stories of the stables.[32] The crowd\r\nfilling the square melted away. Members of the Soldiers' Council\r\nreturned the fire. The shooting continued until late into the night,\r\nwhen members of the Soldiers' Council entered the stables. They found\r\nnobody there.\r\n\r\n[32] This story of the origin of Saturday evening's shooting\r\n    comes from the Soldiers' Council, and is undoubtedly\r\n    exaggerated. No other report of the incident is, however,\r\n    available.\r\n\r\nBy whom or with what intention the first shots were fired is not\r\nknown. The most radical of the revolutionaries, and especially the\r\nLiebknecht followers, saw in them the beginning of the dreaded\r\n\"counter-revolution.\" The stables were at the time occupied by some of\r\nthe marines who had been brought to Berlin two days earlier. These men,\r\nwho were later to cause the new government so much trouble,[33] were in\r\nlarge part what is so aptly expressed by the slang term \"roughnecks.\"\r\nTheir leader was a degraded officer named Heinrich Dorrenbach.[34]\r\nViewed in the light of their subsequent conduct it is impossible that\r\nthey could have been won for any counter-revolutionary movement. The\r\nrevolutionaries, however, who knew that they had been summoned by Prince\r\nMax's government, concluded that the shots had been fired by them. There\r\nwere few casualties from the encounter.\r\n\r\n[33] It was these men who surrounded the imperial chancellery on\r\n    December 24th, held the cabinet members there _incommunicado_\r\n    by severing the telephone wires, and compelled the government\r\n    to grant their wage demands and to permit them to retain the\r\n    royal stables as barracks. They also helped loot the palace.\r\n    The government had to disarm them during the second\r\n    \"Bolshevik week\" in Berlin early in March, when twenty-four\r\n    of them were summarily executed.\r\n\r\n[34] Dorrenbach was afterward indicted in Brunswick for bribery\r\n    and looting.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists' three delegates conferred again with Dittmann,\r\nVogtherr and Ledebour, the Independents' representatives. They were\r\nunable to come to an agreement, and the Independents withdrew to confer\r\nwith their party's executive committee. This committee debated the\r\nquestion for some hours with the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council.[35]\r\nLiebknecht, still nominally an Independent, for the _Spartacus Bund_ had\r\nnot yet been formally organized as a separate party; Ledebour, Dittmann,\r\nand Barth, who was chairman of the council, took a leading part in the\r\ndebate that ensued. It was finally decided to make the Independents'\r\nparticipation in the government conditional upon the granting of certain\r\ndemands. First of all, the new government must be only a _provisorium_\r\nfor the conclusion of the armistice, and its existence was to be limited\r\nto three days. Before the expiration of that term the Soviet was to\r\ndecide what course should then be taken. The republic must be a\r\nsocialistic republic,[36] and all legislative, executive and judicial\r\npower must rest in the hands of the Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils,\r\nwho were to be elected by \"the laboring population _under the exclusion\r\nof all bourgeois elements_.\"[37]\r\n\r\n[35] That the radical wing of the German Socialists conferred in\r\n    a party matter with this council, which was supposed to\r\n    represent Socialists of both parties, is significant. As a\r\n    matter of fact, the real power in the council was from the\r\n    beginning in the hands of the Independent and Spartacan\r\n    members, and their ascendancy grew steadily.\r\n\r\n[36] Here, as the demands show, \"socialistic\" in the most rigid\r\n    and \"class-conscious\" partisan sense.\r\n\r\n[37] The italics are those of the Independents themselves, as\r\n    used in publishing their demands in their party organ.\r\n\r\nThese demands were communicated to the Majority Socialist delegates,\r\nwho, after a conference with their party's executive committee, rejected\r\nthem. They especially opposed the exclusion of all _bourgeois_ statesmen\r\nfrom the government, declaring that this would make the provisioning of\r\nthe people impossible. They demanded cooperation of the two parties\r\nuntil the convening of a constituent assembly, and rejected the\r\nthree-day limitation upon the existence of the government to be formed.\r\nFurther negotiations between the two sets of delegates were agreed on\r\nfor Sunday morning.\r\n\r\nThe German Socialists have always had a keen appreciation of the\r\ninfluence of the press. No other country has such an extensive,\r\nwell-edited and influential array of Socialist newspapers and\r\nperiodicals as Germany, and in no other country are the Socialists so\r\ncarefully disciplined into taking their political views from their party\r\norgans. As the parent party, the Majority Socialists already had their\r\npress. The Independents had no organ of any importance in Berlin, and\r\nLiebknecht's Spartacans had none at all. This, for persons who, if not\r\nin abstract theory, nevertheless in actual practice refuse to admit that\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_ has any rights whatever, was a matter easily remedied.\r\nLiebknecht, at the head of a group of armed soldiers, went in the\r\nevening to the plant of the Conservative _Lokal-Anzeiger_, turned out\r\nthe whole staff and took possession. The paper appeared Sunday morning\r\nas _Die rote Fahne_ (The Red Flag). Independent Socialists and members\r\nof the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council at the same time took violent\r\npossession of the venerable _Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_, which\r\nthey published Sunday morning as _Die Internationale_.\r\n\r\nThe Wolff Bureau had already been occupied by members of the Workmen's\r\nand Soldiers' Council. It was compelled to send out any articles coming\r\nfrom that council, and its other news dispatches were subjected to a\r\ncensorship quite as rigid and _tendencieuse_ and even less intelligent\r\nthan that prevailing under the old regime. The committee put in charge\r\nof the Wolff Bureau was nominally composed of an equal number of\r\nMajority and Independent Socialists, but the latter, by dint of their\r\nrabid energy and resolution, were able for a long time to put their\r\nimprint on all news issuing from the bureau.\r\n\r\n_Die rote Fahne_ of Sunday morning published on the first page a leading\r\nArticle which undoubtedly was written by Liebknecht himself. It began:\r\n\r\n    \"Proudly the red flag floats over the imperial capital. Berlin\r\n    has tardily followed the glorious example of the Kiel sailors,\r\n    the Hamburg shipyard laborers and the soldiers and workingmen of\r\n    various other states.\"\r\n\r\nThe article glorified the revolution and declared that it must sweep\r\naway \"the remains and ruins of feudalism.\" There must be not merely a\r\nrepublic, but a socialistic republic, and its flag must not be \"the\r\nblack, red and gold flag of the _bourgeois_ Republic of 1848, but the\r\nred flag of the international socialistic proletariat, the red flag of\r\nthe Commune of 1871 and of the Russian revolutions of 1905 and 1912.\r\n**** The revolutionary, triumphant proletariat must erect a new order\r\nout of the ruins of the World War. **** The first tasks in this\r\ndirection are speedy peace, genuine proletarian domination, reshaping of\r\neconomic life from the pseudo-socialism of the war to the real socialism\r\nof peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe article closed with an appeal to workingmen and soldiers to retain\r\ntheir weapons and go forward \"under the victorious emblem of the red\r\nflag.\"\r\n\r\nOn the third page of the same issue appeared another article, also\r\nprobably from Liebknecht's pen. It was an appeal to the \"workmen and\r\nsoldiers in Berlin\" to fortify the power already won by them. \"The red\r\nflag floats over Berlin,\"[38] wrote Liebknecht again. But this was only\r\na beginning. \"The work is not finished with the abdication of a couple\r\nof Hohenzollerns. Still less is it accomplished by the entrance into the\r\ngovernment of a couple more government Socialists. These have supported\r\nthe _bourgeoisie_ for four years and they cannot do otherwise now.\"\r\n\r\n[38] No one can long study objectively the manifestations of\r\n    partisan Social-Democracy without feeling that there is\r\n    something pathological about the fetichistic worship of the\r\n    red flag by the radical elements among the Socialists.\r\n\r\n\"Mistrust is the first democratic virtue,\" declared Liebknecht. The\r\ngovernment must be completely reorganized. He then set forth the demands\r\nthat must be presented. They are of interest as the first formulation of\r\nthe program of those who afterward became the supporters of Bolshevist\r\nideals in Germany. Except for certain points designed only to meet then\r\nexisting conditions this program is still in essentials that of the\r\nGerman Communists, as the Spartacans now term themselves. It follows:\r\n\r\n    1. Disarming of the whole police force, of all officers and\r\n    also of such soldiers as do not stand on the base of the new\r\n    order; arming of the people;[39] all soldiers and\r\n    proletarians who are armed to retain their weapons.\r\n\r\n    [39] _Bewaffnung des Volkes_; \"people\" used as a synonym for\r\n        the proletarian section of it. The _Bourgeoisie_ are not\r\n        _das Volk_ (the people) to the extreme Socialist.\r\n\r\n    2. Taking over of all military and civil offices and commands\r\n    by representatives (_Vertrauensmaenner_) of the Workmen's and\r\n    Soldiers' Council.\r\n\r\n    3. Surrender of all weapons and stores of munitions, as well\r\n    as of all other armaments, to the Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\n    4. Control by the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council of all\r\n    means of traffic.\r\n\r\n    5. Abolishment of courts-martial; corpse-like obedience\r\n    (_Kadavergehorsam_) to be replaced by voluntary discipline of\r\n    the soldiers under control of the Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Council.\r\n\r\n    6. Abolishment of the Reichstag and of all parliaments,[40]\r\n    as well as of the existing national government; taking over\r\n    of the government by the Berlin Workmen's and Soldiers'\r\n    Council until the formation of a national workmen's and\r\n    soldiers' council.\r\n\r\n    [40] Americans inclined to extend sympathy to Liebknecht (or\r\n        his memory) are again reminded that he and his followers are\r\n        violent opponents of democracy. The same is true of the real\r\n        leaders of the Independent Socialists.\r\n\r\n    7. Election throughout Germany of workmen's and soldiers'\r\n    councils, in whose hands exclusively the lawgiving and\r\n    administrative power shall rest.\r\n\r\n    8. Abolishment of dynasties[41] and separate states; our\r\n    parole is: United Socialistic Republic of Germany.\r\n\r\n    [41] Several of the German dynasties were still in existence\r\n        on the morning of November 10th. King Friedrich August of\r\n        Saxony, Grand Duke Ernst Ludwig of Hesse and Grand Duke\r\n        Friedrich August of Oldenburg were deposed on November 10th,\r\n        and Prince Heinrich XXVII of Reuss (younger line) abdicated\r\n        on the same day. The King of Saxony accepted his deposition\r\n        by a formal act of abdication two days later. Duke Karl\r\n        Eduard of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, and Grand Duke Friedrich Franz\r\n        of Mecklenburg-Schwerin abdicated on November 13th. King\r\n        Ludwig of Bavaria, whom Kurt Eisner had already declared\r\n        deposed, issued a statement on November 13th liberating all\r\n        officials from their oath of allegiance, \"since I am no\r\n        longer in a position to direct the government.\" The Munich\r\n        Soviet acknowledged this as an act of abdication. Prince\r\n        Friedrich of Waldeck-Pyrmont, refusing to abdicate, was\r\n        deposed on the same day. Grand Duke Friedrich of Baden and\r\n        Prince Adolf of Schaumburg-Lippe did not leave their thrones\r\n        until November 15th.\r\n\r\n    9. The immediate establishing of relations with all workmen's\r\n    and soldiers' councils existing in Germany, and with the\r\n    socialistic brother parties of foreign countries.\r\n\r\n    10. The immediate recall to Berlin of the Russian Embassy.\r\n\r\nThis proclamation closed by declaring that no real Socialist must enter\r\nthe government as long as a single \"government\" Socialist (Majority)\r\nbelonged to it. \"There can be no cooperation with those who have\r\nbetrayed us for four years,\" said the proclamation.\r\n\r\nThis item followed: \"_Die rote Fahne_ sends its first and warmest\r\ngreeting to the Federative Socialistic Soviet Republic (Russia) and begs\r\nthat government to tell our Russian brethren that the Berlin\r\nlaboring-class has celebrated the first anniversary of the Russian\r\nrevolution by bringing about the German revolution.\"\r\n\r\n_Die Internationale_ also published a leader glorifying the revolution\r\nand declaring that \"the red flag floats over the capital.\" It called on\r\nits readers to be on their guard and closed with a _lebe hoch_![42] for\r\nthe German Socialistic Republic and the _Internationale_.\r\n\r\n[42] Literally, \"may it live high!\" The French _vive_ and the\r\n    English \"hurrah for--!\"\r\n\r\nAll the Sunday morning papers published a proclamation and an appeal by\r\nthe \"Imperial Chancellor,\" Ebert. The proclamation was addressed to\r\n\"Fellow Citizens,\"[43] and was a formal notice that Ebert had taken over\r\nhis office from Prince Max and was about to form a new government. He\r\nrequested the aid of all good citizens and warned especially against any\r\nacts calculated to interfere with supplying food to the people. The\r\nappeal was a summons to all officials throughout the country to place\r\nthemselves at the disposition of the new government.[44] \"I know it will\r\nbe hard for many to work with the new men who have undertaken the\r\nconduct of the government,\" said the appeal, \"but I appeal to their love\r\nfor our people.\"\r\n\r\n[43] _Mitbuerger._ Subsequent proclamations were, with few\r\n    exceptions, addressed to _Genossen_. The government could not\r\n    shake off its party fetters.\r\n\r\n[44] It is not possible to withhold admiration from the tens of\r\n    thousands of officials throughout Germany who, hating and\r\n    despising party Socialism, and themselves monarchic in\r\n    principle by tradition and training, nevertheless stayed at\r\n    their posts and did what they could to prevent utter chaos.\r\n    The choice was especially hard for the men in higher\r\n    positions, since most of these not only had to carry out\r\n    orders of a revolutionary red government, but also had to\r\n    submit to having their daily acts controlled and their orders\r\n    altered and countersigned by a _Genosse_ who was often an\r\n    unskilled manual laborer. The best traditions of German\r\n    officialdom were honorably upheld by these men, and it is to\r\n    them, rather than to those at the head of the government,\r\n    that credit is due for even the small measure of order that\r\n    was preserved.\r\n\r\nSunday was ushered in with the crack of rifle fire and the rattle of\r\nmachine-guns. Nervous _Genossen_, incited by fanatics or irresponsible\r\nagitators saw the specter of counterrevolution on every hand and\r\ncirculated wild tales of officers firing on the people from various\r\nbuildings, chiefly the Victoria Cafe and the Bauer Cafe at the corner of\r\nUnter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse, some buildings near the\r\nFriedrichstrasse railway station, other buildings farther down Unter den\r\nLinden, and the Engineers' Society building and the official home of the\r\nReichstag president, the two last-named buildings situated across the\r\nstreet to the east of the Reichstag. While it is barely possible that\r\nsome loyal cadets may have fired on a crowd in one or two places, it has\r\nnever been definitely proved. The talk of resistance by officers is\r\nabsurd. The only occupant of the residence of the Reichstag president,\r\nwhich was fired at with machine guns from the roof of the Reichstag, was\r\none frightened old woman, who spent the day crouching in a corner of the\r\ncellar. There was nobody in the Engineers' building. The day's victims\r\nwere all killed to no purpose by the wild shooting of persons--mainly\r\nyouths--who lost their heads. The shooting continued on Monday, but\r\ngradually died out. The stories sent to the outside world through the\r\nsoviet-controlled Wolff Bureau of officers firing on the revolutionaries\r\nand then escaping by subterranean passages were the inventions of\r\nexcited and untrained minds.\r\n\r\nIt had been decided at Saturday night's conference to hold an election\r\non Sunday morning for district workmen's and soldiers' councils, and to\r\nhold a meeting at the Circus Busch at five o'clock Sunday afternoon to\r\nform the government. Sunday morning's papers published the summons for\r\nthe election. The larger factories were directed to elect one delegate\r\nfor every thousand employees. Factories employing fewer than five\r\nhundred persons were directed to unite for the election of delegates.\r\nEach battalion of soldiers was also to choose one delegate. These\r\ndelegates were directed to meet at Circus Busch for the election of a\r\nprovisional government.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists were in a difficult position. The Independents\r\nclaimed--and with right--that they had \"made the revolution.\" The\r\npreponderance of brute force was probably, so far as Berlin alone was\r\nconcerned, on their side. In any event they had a support formidable\r\nenough to compel Scheidemann and his followers to make concessions to\r\nthem. The three delegates from each party met again. The result of\r\ntheir deliberations was concessions on both sides. The Majority\r\nSocialists agreed to exclude _bourgeois_ elements from the cabinet,\r\nbut the Independents agreed that this should not apply to those\r\nministers (war, navy, etc.), whose posts required men of special\r\ntraining--the so-called _Fachminister_. The Independents consented to\r\nenter the government without placing a time-limit on their stay or on\r\nits existence. Each party was to designate three \"people's\r\ncommissioners\" (_Volksbeauftragte_), who were to have equal rights.\r\nThe Independents stipulated further in their conditions (which were\r\naccepted):\r\n\r\n    \"The political power shall be in the hands of the workmen's and\r\n    soldiers' councils, which shall be summoned shortly from all\r\n    parts of the empire for a plenary session.\r\n\r\n    \"The question of a constituent assembly will not become a live\r\n    issue until after a consolidation of the conditions created by\r\n    the revolution, and shall therefore be reserved for later\r\n    consideration.\"\r\n\r\nThe Independents announced that, these conditions being accepted, their\r\nparty had named as members of the government Hugo Haase, Wilhelm\r\nDittmann and Emil Barth. Dittmann had but recently been released from\r\njail, where he was serving a short sentence for revolutionary and\r\nanti-war propaganda. He was secretary of the Independent Socialist\r\nparty's executive committee, an honest fanatic and but one step removed\r\nfrom a communist. Barth was in every way unfit to be a member of any\r\ngovernment. There were grave stories afloat, some of them well founded,\r\nof his moral derelictions, and he was a man of no particular ability.\r\nSome months later, and several weeks after he had resigned from the\r\ncabinet, he was found riding about Southern Germany on the pass issued\r\nto him as a cabinet member and agitating for the overthrow of the\r\ngovernment of which he had been a part.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists selected as their representatives in the\r\ngovernment Friedrich (Fritz) Ebert, Phillip Scheidemann and Otto\r\nLandsberg, the last named an able and respected lawyer and one of the\r\nintellectual leaders of the Berlin Socialists.\r\n\r\nWhen, at 5:00 P.M., the combined workmen's and soldiers' councils of\r\nGreater Berlin met in the Circus Busch, Ebert was able to announce that\r\nthe differences between the two Socialist parties had been adjusted. The\r\nannouncement was greeted with hearty applause. The meeting had a\r\nsomewhat stormy character, but was more orderly than might have been\r\nexpected. A considerable number of front-soldiers were present, and the\r\nmeeting was dominated throughout by them. They demonstrated at the\r\noutset that they had no sympathy with fanatic and ultraradical agitators\r\nand measures, and Liebknecht, who delivered a characteristic passionate\r\nharangue, demanding the exclusion of the Majority Socialists from any\r\nparticipation in the government, had great difficulty in getting a\r\nhearing. The choice of the six \"people's commissioners\" was ratified by\r\nthe meeting.\r\n\r\nIt is a striking thing, explainable probably only by mass-psychology,\r\nthat although the meeting was openly hostile to Liebknecht and his\r\nfollowers, it nevertheless voted by an overwhelming majority, to \"send\r\nthe Russian Workmen's and Soldiers' government our fraternal greetings,\"\r\nand decided that the new German government should \"immediately resume\r\nrelations with the Russian government, whose representative in Berlin it\r\nawaits.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting adopted a proclamation declaring that the first task for the\r\nnew government should be the conclusion of an armistice. \"An immediate\r\npeace,\" said this proclamation, \"is the revolution's parole. However\r\nthis peace may be, it will be better than a continuation of the\r\nunprecedented slaughter.\"[45] The proclamation declared that the\r\nsocialization of capitalistic means of production was feasible and\r\nnecessary, and that the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council was \"convinced\r\nthat an upheaval along the same lines is being prepared throughout the\r\nwhole world. It expects confidently that the proletariat of other\r\ncountries will devote its entire might to prevent injustice being done\r\nto the German people at the end of the war.\"[46] Following the adoption\r\nof this proclamation, the meeting elected a _Vollzugsrat_ or executive\r\ncouncil from the membership of the workmen's and soldiers' councils\r\npresent. It was made up of twenty-eight men, fourteen workmen and\r\nfourteen soldiers, and the Majority and Independent Socialists were\r\nrepresented on each branch of the council with seven members. The\r\ntwenty-eight men chosen were Emil Barth, Captain von Beerfelde,\r\nBergmann, Felix Bernhagen, Otto Braun, Franz Buchel, Max Cohen (Reuss),\r\nErich Daeumig, Heinrich Denecke, Paul Eckert, Christian Finzel, Gelberg,\r\nGustav Gerhardt, Gierth, Gustav Heller, Ernst Juelich, Georg Ledebour,\r\nMaynitz, Brutus Molkenbuhr, Richard Mueller, Paul Neuendorf, Hans\r\nPaasche, Walter Portner, Colin Ross, Otto Strobel, Waltz and P. Wegmann.\r\nCaptain von Beerfelde was made chairman of the soldiers' branch and\r\nMueller of the workmen's representatives on this council. Mueller, a\r\nmetal-worker by trade, was a rabid Independent Socialist, a fiery\r\nagitator and bitter opponent of a constituent assembly. It was largely\r\ndue to his leadership and to the support accorded him by Ledebour and\r\ncertain other radical members of the _Vollzugsrat_ that this council\r\nsteadily drifted farther and farther toward the Independent and\r\nSpartacan side and ultimately became one of the greatest hindrances to\r\nhonest government until its teeth were drawn in December.\r\n\r\n[45] Germany would have accepted almost any kind of peace in\r\n    November. This is but one of many things indicating it.\r\n\r\n[46] There is something both characteristic and pathetic in the\r\n    German Socialists' confidence that the proletariat in the\r\n    enemy countries would follow their example. The wish was, of\r\n    course, father to the thought, but it exhibited that same\r\n    striking inability to comprehend other peoples' psychology\r\n    that characterized the Germans throughout the war.\r\n\r\nThe council, however, started out well. Its first act, following the\r\nCircus Busch meeting, was to order the _Lokal-Anzeiger_ and the\r\n_Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_ restored to their lawful owners, and\r\nthis was done. The council formally confirmed the choice of the six\r\n_Volksbeauftragte_ and established rules for their guidance. Neither the\r\ncouncil nor the people's commissioners could claim to have their mandate\r\nfrom the whole Empire, but they assumed it. Revolutionary governments\r\ncannot be particular, and Berlin was, after all, the capital and most\r\nimportant city. There was, furthermore, no time to wait for general\r\nelections. The Circus Busch meeting had good revolutionary precedents,\r\nand some sort of central government was urgently necessary.\r\n\r\nThere was still some scattered firing in Berlin on Monday, but\r\ncomparative order was established. The six-man cabinet was in almost\r\nuninterrupted session, and the first result of its deliberation was an\r\nedict, issued on Tuesday, making many fundamental changes in existing\r\nlaws. The edict lifted the \"state of siege,\" which had existed since the\r\noutbreak of the war. All limitations upon the right of assembly were\r\nremoved, and it was especially provided that state employees and\r\nofficials should enjoy the right freely to assemble. The censorship was\r\nabolished, including also the censorship of theaters.[47] \"Expression of\r\nopinion in word and print\" was declared free.[48] The free exercise of\r\nreligion was guaranteed. Amnesty was granted all political prisoners,\r\nand pending prosecutions for political offenses were annulled.[49] The\r\nDomestic Servants law was declared repealed.[50] It was promised that a\r\ngeneral eight-hour law should become effective not later than January 1,\r\n1919. Other sociological reforms were promised, and woman's suffrage was\r\nintroduced with the provision that \"all elections for public offices\r\nshall hereafter be conducted under equal, secret, general and direct\r\nvote on the proportional system by all males and females twenty years\r\nold or over.\"[51] The same system, it was decreed, should be followed in\r\nthe elections for the national assembly.\r\n\r\n[47] Consistent efforts were made by those interested in\r\n    discrediting all news sent from Germany after the revolution\r\n    to make the general public believe that a rigid censorship of\r\n    outgoing letters and news telegrams was still maintained. The\r\n    American so-called Military Intelligence--which is\r\n    responsible for an appalling amount of\r\n    misinformation--reported in January that the censorship was\r\n    stricter than during the war. This was untrue. The author, at\r\n    that time a working journalist in Berlin, was repeatedly\r\n    entrusted with the censor's stamp and told to stamp his own\r\n    messages when they were ready, since the censor desired to\r\n    leave his office. The only reason for maintaining even the\r\n    formality of a censorship was to prevent the illegitimate\r\n    transfer of securities or money out of the country. There was\r\n    no censorship whatever on news messages.\r\n\r\n[48] The immediate result of this was a flood of new papers,\r\n    periodicals and pamphlets, some of them pornographic and many\r\n    of them marked by the grossness which unfortunately\r\n    characterizes much of the German humor. Some of the\r\n    publishers fouled their own nests in a manner difficult to\r\n    understand. One pamphlet sold on the streets was _Die\r\n    franzoesischen Liebschaften des deutschen Kronprinzen waehrend\r\n    des Krieges_.\r\n\r\n[49] This principle was to make much trouble later for the\r\n    government, for the radical Socialists consider murder a\r\n    \"political crime\" if the victim be a _bourgeois_ politician.\r\n    There are also extremists for whom any prisoner is a victim\r\n    of capitalism, and hundreds of dangerous criminals were\r\n    released in Berlin and various other cities in raids on jails\r\n    and prisons.\r\n\r\n[50] Domestic servants, particularly those in hotels, were real\r\n    gainers by the revolution. Chambermaids, for example, who had\r\n    always been on duty from 6 A.M. until 11 or 12 P.M., suddenly\r\n    found themselves able, for the first time in their lives, to\r\n    get enough sleep and to have some time at their own disposal.\r\n\r\n[51] Twenty-five years had formerly been the age entitling one to\r\n    vote. The reduction undoubtedly operated primarily in favor\r\n    of the Socialists, for youth is inclined to radicalism\r\n    everywhere.\r\n\r\n_Vorwaerts_, in a leader on the same day, spoke of the constituent\r\nassembly as of a thing assured. A good impression was made by the report\r\nthat Hindenburg had remained at his post and placed himself at the\r\ndisposition of the new government. Prince Leopold of Prussia also\r\nassured the government of his support.\r\n\r\nThe revolution had started well. Reports that the Poles were plundering\r\nin Posen and Upper Silesia made little impression. The proletariat was\r\nintoxicated with its new liberty. The saner _bourgeoisie_ were\r\ndifferently minded: \"_Das Boese sind wir los; die Boesen sind\r\ngeblieben_.\"[52]\r\n\r\n[52] We have shaken off the great evil; the evil-doers have\r\n    remained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n                   \"The German Socialistic Republic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe character and completeness of the revolution were even yet not\r\nrealized in all parts of Germany. Rulers of various states, in some\r\nplaces aided by Majority Socialists, made desperate eleventh-hour\r\nattempts to save their thrones. Prince Regent Aribert of Anhalt received\r\na deputation of National Liberals, Progressives and Socialists, who\r\npresented a program for parliamentarization. The Socialists,\r\nProgressives, Clericals and Guelphs in Brunswick coalesced \"to further a\r\npolicy of peace and progress and to spare our people severe internal\r\ndisorders.\" The two Reuss principalities amalgamated, and a reformed\r\nfranchise and parliamentarization were promised. The government in\r\nHesse-Darmstadt ordered thorough parliamentary reforms. The Wuerttemburg\r\nministry resigned and the Progressive Reichstag Deputy Liesching was\r\nappointed Minister-President. Grand Duke Ernst Wilhelm of Saxe-Weimar\r\nrenounced the right of exemption from taxation enjoyed not only by him\r\npersonally, but by all his family and court officials. Grand Duke\r\nFriedrich Franz of Mecklenburg-Schwerin received a deputation to discuss\r\nparliamentary reforms. A Socialist meeting in Breslau broke up in\r\ndisorder because the Majority Socialists opposed the Independent\r\nSocialists' demand that force be employed to secure the fulfillment of\r\ntheir demands.\r\n\r\nBut dynasties could not longer be saved. When night came on Monday, the\r\nrevolution in Germany was to all practical intents an accomplished fact.\r\nFourteen of the twenty-five states, including all four kingdoms and all\r\nthe other really important states, were already securely in the\r\nrevolutionaries' hands. The red flag waved over the historic royal\r\npalace in Berlin. King Ludwig of Bavaria had been declared deposed and\r\nhad fled from his capital. King Friedrich August of Saxony was still\r\nnominally occupying his throne, but soldiers' councils had taken over\r\nthe government both in Dresden and Leipsic, and were considering the\r\nKing's abdication. Wuerttemberg had been declared a republic and the King\r\nhad announced that he would not be an obstacle to any movement demanded\r\nby the majority of his people. The free cities of Hamburg, Bremen and\r\nLuebeck were being ruled by Socialists. In the grand duchies of\r\nOldenburg, Baden, Hesse and the Mecklenburgs the rulers' power was gone\r\nand their thrones were tottering. Grand Duke Ernst August of Brunswick,\r\nthe Kaiser's son-in-law, abdicated.\r\n\r\nAnd the Kaiser and King of Prussia fled.\r\n\r\nNothing more vividly illustrates the physical, mental and moral\r\nexhaustion of the German people at this time than the fact that the\r\nformer ruler's flight hardly evoked more than passing interest. Many\r\nnewspapers published it with no more display than they gave to orders by\r\nGermany's new rulers, and none \"played it up\" as a great news item.\r\n\r\nThe clearest picture of the occurrences at the Kaiser's headquarters on\r\nthe fatal November 9th has been given by General Count von Schulenberg,\r\nchief of the General Staff of the Crown Prince's army. Von Schulenberg\r\nwas present also on November 1st, when Minister of the Interior Drews\r\npresented the government's request that the Kaiser abdicate. Drews had\r\nhardly finished speaking, reports von Schulenberg, before the Kaiser\r\nexclaimed:\r\n\r\n    \"You, a Prussian official, who have sworn the oath of fealty to\r\n    your king, how can you venture to come before me with such a\r\n    proposal?\r\n\r\n    \"Have you considered what chaos would follow? Think of it! I\r\n    abdicate for my person and my house! All the dynasties in\r\n    Germany collapse in an instant. The army has no leader, the\r\n    front disintegrates, the soldiers stream in disorder across the\r\n    Rhine. The revolutionaries join hands, murder, incendiarism and\r\n    plundering follow, and the enemy assists. I have no idea of\r\n    abdicating. The King of Prussia may not be false to Germany,\r\n    least of all at a time like this. I, too, have sworn an oath,\r\n    and I will keep it.\"\r\n\r\nHindenburg and Groener (Ludendorff's successor) shared the Kaiser's\r\nopinion at this time that abdication was not to be thought of. The\r\nsituation, however, altered rapidly in the next few days. Von\r\nSchulenburg declares that Scheidemann[53] was the chief factor in the\r\nmovement to compel the monarch to go. Early on the morning of November\r\n9th, when von Schulenberg reached headquarters building in Spa, he found\r\ngeneral depression. \"Everybody appeared to have lost his head.\" The\r\nvarious army chiefs were present to report on the feeling among their\r\nmen. Hindenburg had reported to them that revolution had broken out in\r\nGermany, that railways, telegraphs and provision depots were in the\r\nrevolutionaries' hands, and that some of the bridges across the Rhine\r\nhad been occupied by them. The armies were thus threatened with being\r\ncut off from the homeland. Von Schulenberg continues:\r\n\r\n    \"I met Generals von Plessen and Marschall, who told me that the\r\n    Field Marshall (Hindenburg) and General Groener were on the way\r\n    to tell the Kaiser that his immediate abdication was necessary.\r\n    I answered: 'You're mad. The army is on the Kaiser's side.' The\r\n    two took me with them to the Kaiser. The conference began by\r\n    Hindenburg's saying to the Kaiser that he must beg to be\r\n    permitted to resign, since he could not, as a Prussian officer,\r\n    give his King the message which he must give. The Kaiser\r\n    answered: 'Well, let us hear the message first.' Thereupon\r\n    Groener gave a long description of the situation, the homeland\r\n    in the hands of revolutionists, revolution to be expected in\r\n    Berlin at any minute, and the army not to be depended on. To\r\n    attempt with the enemy in the rear to turn the army about and\r\n    set it in march for civil warfare was not to be thought of. The\r\n    only salvation for the Fatherland lay in the Kaiser's immediate\r\n    abdication. Hindenburg, the general intendant and chief of\r\n    military railways agreed with Groener.\"\r\n\r\n[53] Cf. Scheidemann's statement to von Payer, chapter viii.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser asked von Schulenberg's opinion. He disagreed with the\r\nothers, and counseled resistance. He agreed that it would be impossible\r\nto invade all Germany with united front, but advocated an attack on a\r\nfew places, such as Cologne and Aachen, with picked troops, and an\r\nappeal to the people to rise against the marines, who had been \"incited\r\nto action by the Jews, who had made great profits in the war, and by\r\npersons who had escaped doing their duty in the war and were now trying\r\nto knife the army in the back.\"\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser approved this counsel. He would not abdicate, he declared,\r\nnor would he have any part in bringing about civil warfare, but Cologne,\r\nAachen and Verviers must be attacked immediately.\r\n\r\nGroener was unconvinced. He declared that the revolution had gone too\r\nfar and was too well organized throughout Germany to make it possible to\r\nput it down by force of arms. Moreover, he said, several army chiefs had\r\nreported that the army could no longer be depended on. The Kaiser\r\nthereupon asked for a report from every army chief on the army's\r\ndependability. A summons to this effect was sent out, and Groener,\r\nHindenburg and von Schulenberg remained with the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nOne calamitous report after another began coming from Berlin. The\r\nmilitary governor reported that he had no longer any dependable troops.\r\nThe Chancellor telephoned that civil war was inevitable unless the\r\nKaiser's abdication was received within a few minutes. The Kaiser and\r\nthe Crown Prince conferred together. Another report came from the\r\nChancellor that the situation in Berlin was steadily becoming graver.\r\nAdmiral von Hintze, Minister of Foreign Affairs, who had joined the\r\nlittle group in the Kaiser's rooms, declared that the monarchy could not\r\nbe saved unless the Kaiser abdicated at once.\r\n\r\nVon Schulenberg continues:\r\n\r\n    \"His Majesty thereupon told Excellency von Hintze to telephone\r\n    to the Chancellor that, in order to prevent bloodshed, he would\r\n    abdicate as Kaiser, but that he would remain as King of Prussia\r\n    and not leave his army. I declared that His Majesty's decision\r\n    should be formulated in writing and telephoned to the Chancellor\r\n    only when it bore the Kaiser's signature. His Majesty thereupon\r\n    commissioned Excellency von Hintze, Generals von Pless and\r\n    Marschall and myself to draw up the declaration. While we were\r\n    at work on it, the chief of the Imperial Chancellery, Excellency\r\n    von Wahnschaffe, telephoned. I talked with him myself, and when\r\n    he said that the abdication must be in Berlin within a few\r\n    minutes, answered that such an important matter as the Kaiser's\r\n    abdication could not be completed in a few minutes. The decision\r\n    was made and was now being put into form; the government must be\r\n    patient for the half-hour that would be required to place the\r\n    abdication in its hands. The declaration had the following form:\r\n\r\n        \"'1. His Majesty is prepared to abdicate as Kaiser if\r\n        further bloodshed can be hindered thereby.\r\n\r\n        \"'2. His Majesty desires that there be no civil war.\r\n\r\n        \"'3. His Majesty remains as King of Prussia and will\r\n        lead his army back to the homeland in disciplined order.'\r\n\r\n    \"This declaration was approved and signed by His Majesty, and\r\n    was telephoned by Excellency von Hintze to the Chancellery. At\r\n    8:10 o'clock in the evening His Majesty received from the office\r\n    of the Imperial Chancellor a report of the announcement made\r\n    public through the Wolff Bureau, in which the Imperial\r\n    Chancellor, without waiting for the Kaiser's answer, had\r\n    reported the Kaiser's abdication as Kaiser and King. His Majesty\r\n    received the news with the deepest seriousness and with royal\r\n    dignity. He asked my views on the situation. I answered:\r\n\r\n        \"'It is a coup d'etat, an abuse of power to which your\r\n        Majesty must not submit. Your Majesty is King of\r\n        Prussia, and there is now more than ever a pressing\r\n        necessity for Your Majesty to remain with the army as\r\n        supreme commander. I guarantee that it will be true to\r\n        Your Majesty.'\r\n\r\n    \"His Majesty replied that he was and would remain King of\r\n    Prussia, and that he would not abandon the army. Thereupon he\r\n    commissioned Generals von Pless and Marschall and Excellency von\r\n    Hintze to report to the Field Marshal what had happened. He then\r\n    took leave of the Crown Prince and of me. After I had left, he\r\n    called me back, thanked me once more and said:\r\n\r\n        \"'I remain King of Prussia and I remain with the troops.'\r\n\r\n    \"I answered:\r\n\r\n        \"'Come to the front troops in my section. Your Majesty\r\n        will be in absolute safety there. Promise me to remain\r\n        with the army in all events.'\r\n\r\n    \"His Majesty took leave of me with the words:\r\n\r\n        \"'I remain with the army.'\r\n\r\n    \"I took leave of him and have not seen him again.\"\r\n\r\nIn the general condemnation of the Kaiser, his flight to Holland has\r\nbeen construed as due to cowardice. His motives are unimportant, but\r\nthis construction appears to be unjust. He was convinced that he had\r\nnothing to fear from his people, nor is there any reason to suppose that\r\nhe would for a moment have been in danger if he had remained. It is also\r\nprobable that he entertained hopes of leading a successful\r\ncounter-revolutionary movement. But his protests were overruled by men\r\nin whom he had great confidence. Hindenburg and Groener, following an\r\nunfavorable report from nearly all the army chiefs regarding the feeling\r\nin their commands, told the Kaiser that they could not guarantee his\r\nsafety for a single night. They declared even that the picked\r\nstorm-battalion guarding his headquarters at Spa was not to be depended\r\non.\r\n\r\nOthers added their entreaties, and finally, unwillingly and\r\nprotestingly, the Kaiser consented to go.\r\n\r\nWith him went the Crown Prince. There was no one left in Germany to\r\nwhom adherents of a counter-revolution could rally. Scheming\r\npoliticians for months afterward painted on every wall the spectre of\r\ncounter-revolution, and it proved a powerful weapon of agitation against\r\nthe more conservative and democratic men in charge of the country's\r\naffairs, but counter-revolution from above--and that was what these\r\nleaders falsely or ignorantly pretended to fear--was never possible from\r\nthe time the armistice was signed until the peace was made at\r\nVersailles. Counter-revolution ever threatened the stability of the\r\ngovernment, but it was the gory counter-revolution of Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nThe Kaiser's flight had the double effect of encouraging the Socialists\r\nand discouraging the Conservatives, the right wing of the National\r\nLiberals and the few prominent men of other _bourgeois_ parties from\r\nwhom at least a passive resistance might otherwise have been expected.\r\nThe Junkers disappeared from view, and, disappearing, took with them the\r\nablest administrative capacities of Germany, men whose ability was\r\nunquestioned, but who were now so severely compromised that any\r\nparticipation by them in a democratic government was impossible. \"The\r\nGerman People's Republic\" as it had been termed for a brief two days,\r\nbecame the \"German Socialistic Republic.\" Numerically the strongest\r\nparty in the land, the Socialists of all wings insisted upon putting the\r\nred stamp upon the remains of Imperial Germany.\r\n\r\nIn their rejoicing at the revolution and the end of the war, the great\r\nmass of the people forgot for the moment that they were living in a\r\nconquered land. Those that did remember it were lulled into a feeling of\r\nover-optimistic security by the recollection of President Wilson's\r\nrepeated declarations that the war was being waged against the German\r\ngovernmental system and not against the German people, and by the\r\ndeclaration in Secretary Lansing's note of the previous week that the\r\nAllies had accepted the President's peace points with the exception of\r\nthe second.\r\n\r\nThe Soldiers' and Workmen's Councils held plenary sessions on Monday and\r\nratified the proceedings of Sunday. The spirit of the proceedings,\r\nespecially in the Soldiers' Council, was markedly moderate. Ledebour,\r\none of the most radical of the Independent Socialists, was all but\r\nhowled down when he tried to address the soldiers' meeting in the\r\nReichstag. Colin Ross, appealing for harmonious action by all factions\r\nof Social-Democracy, was received with applause. The _Vollzugsrat_,\r\nwhich was now in theory the supreme governing body of Germany, also took\r\ncharge of the affairs of Prussia and Berlin. Two Majority and two\r\nIndependent Socialists were appointed \"people's commissioners\" in\r\nBerlin. It is worthy of note that all four of these men were Jews.\r\nAlmost exactly one per cent of the total population of Germany was made\r\nup of Jews, but here, as in Russia, they played a part out of all\r\nproportion to their numbers. In all the revolutionary governmental\r\nbodies formed under the German Socialistic Republic it would be\r\ndifficult to find a single one in which they did not occupy from a\r\nquarter to a half of all the seats, and they preponderated in many\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nThe _Vollzugsrat_ made a fairly clean sweep among the Prussian\r\nministers, filling the majority of posts with _Genossen_. Many of the\r\nold ministers, however, were retained in the national government,\r\nincluding Dr. Solf as Foreign Minister and General Scheuch as Minister\r\nof War, but each of the _bourgeois_ ministers retained was placed under\r\nthe supervision of two Socialists, one from each party, and he could\r\nissue no valid decrees without their counter-signature. The same plan\r\nwas followed by the revolutionary governments of the various federal\r\nstates. Some of the controllers selected were men of considerable\r\nability, but even these were largely impractical theorists without any\r\nexperience in administration. For the greater part, however, they were\r\nmen who had no qualifications for their important posts except\r\nmembership in one of the Socialist parties and a deep distrust of all\r\n_bourgeois_ officials. The Majority Socialist controllers, even when\r\nthey inclined to agree with their _bourgeois_ department chiefs on\r\nmatters of policy, rarely dared do so because of the shibboleth of\r\nsolidarity still uniting to some degree both branches of the party.\r\nLater, when the responsibilities of power had sobered them and rendered\r\nthem more conservative, and when they found themselves more bitterly\r\nattacked than the _bourgeoisie_ by their former _Genossen_, they shook\r\noff in some degree the thralldom of old ideas, but meanwhile great and\r\nperhaps irreparable damage had been done.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary government faced at the very outset a more difficult\r\ntask than had ever confronted a similar government at any time in the\r\nworld's history. The people, starving, their physical, mental and moral\r\npowers of resistance gone, were ready to follow the demagogue who made\r\nthe most glowing promises. The ablest men of the Empire were sulking in\r\ntheir tents, or had been driven into an enforced seclusion, and the men\r\nin charge of the government were without any practical experience in\r\ngoverning or any knowledge of constructive statecraft. Every one knew\r\nthat the war was practically ended, but thousands of men were\r\nnevertheless being slaughtered daily to no end.\r\n\r\nIn all the Empire's greater cities the revolutionaries, putting into\r\ndisastrous effect their muddled theories of the \"brotherhood of man,\"\r\nhad opened the jails and prisons and flooded the country with criminals.\r\nWhat this meant is dimly indicated by the occurrences in Berlin ten days\r\nlater, when Spartacans raided Police Headquarters and liberated the\r\nprisoners confined there. Among the forty-nine persons thus set free\r\nwere twenty-eight thieves and burglars and five blackmailers and\r\ndeserters; most of the others were old offenders with long criminal\r\nrecords. This was but the grist from one jail in a sporadic raid and the\r\nfirst ten days of November had resulted in wholesale prison-releases of\r\nthe same kind. The situation thus created would have been threatening\r\nenough in any event, but the new masters of the German cities, many of\r\nwhom had good personal reasons for hating all guardians of law and\r\norder, disarmed the police and further crippled their efficiency by\r\nplacing them under the control of \"class-conscious\" soldiers who, at a\r\ntime when every able-bodied fighting man was needed on the west front,\r\nfilled the streets of the greater cities and especially of Berlin.\r\n\r\nThe result was what might have been expected. Many of the new guardians\r\nof law and order were themselves members of the criminal classes, and\r\nthose who were not had neither any acquaintance with criminals and their\r\nways nor with methods of preventing or detecting crime. The police,\r\ndeprived of their weapons and--more fatal still--of their authority,\r\nwere helpless. And this occurred in the face of a steadily increasing\r\nepidemic of criminality, and especially juvenile criminality, which had\r\nbeen observed in all belligerent countries as one of the concomitants of\r\nwar and attained greater proportions in Germany than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only encouragement of crime officially offered. In\r\nante-bellum days, when German cities were orderly and efficient police\r\nand _gendarmerie_ carefully watched the comings and goings of every\r\ninhabitant or visitor in the land, every person coming into Germany or\r\nchanging his residence was compelled to register at the police-station\r\nin his district. But now, when the retention and enforcement of this\r\nrequirement would have been of inestimable value to the government, it\r\nwas generally abolished. The writer, reaching Berlin a week after the\r\nrevolution, went directly to the nearest police-station to report his\r\narrival.\r\n\r\n\"You are no longer required to report to the police,\" said the _Beamter_\r\nin charge.\r\n\r\nAnd thus the bars were thrown down for criminals and--what was\r\nworse--for the propagandists and agents of the Russian Soviet Republic.\r\n_Die neue Freiheit_ (the new freedom) was interpreted in a manner\r\njustifying Goethe's famous dictum of a hundred years earlier that\r\n\"equality and freedom can be enjoyed only in the delirium of insanity\"\r\n(_Gleichheit und Freiheit koennen nur im Taumel des Wahnsinns genossen\r\nwerden_).\r\n\r\nThe _Vollzugsrat_, from whose composition better things had been\r\nexpected, immediately laid plans for the formation of a Red Guard on the\r\nRussian pattern. On November 13th it called a meeting of representatives\r\nof garrisons in Greater Berlin and of the First Corps of Koenigsberg to\r\ndiscuss the functions of the Soldiers' Council. It laid before the\r\nmeeting its plan to equip a force of two thousand \"socialistically\r\nschooled and politically organized workingmen with military training\" to\r\nguard against the danger of a counterrevolution. It redounds to the\r\ncredit of the soldiers that they immediately saw the cloven hoof of the\r\nproposal. \"Why do we need two thousand Red Guards in Berlin?\" was the\r\ncry that arose. Opposition to the plan was practically unanimous, and\r\nthe meeting adopted the following resolution:\r\n\r\n    \"Greater Berlin's garrison, represented by its duly elected\r\n    Soldiers' Council, will view with distrust the weaponing of\r\n    workingmen as long as the government which they are intended to\r\n    protect does not expressly declare itself in favor of summoning\r\n    a national assembly as the only basis for the adoption of a\r\n    constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe meeting took a decided stand against Bolshevism and, in general,\r\nagainst sweeping radicalism. All speakers condemned terrorism from\r\nwhatever side it might be attempted, and declared that plundering and\r\nmurder should be summarily punished. The destructive plans of the\r\nSpartacus group found universal condemnation, and nearly all speakers\r\nemphasized that the Soldiers' Council had no political role to play. Its\r\ntask was merely to preserve order, protect the people and assist in\r\nbringing about an orderly administration of the government's affairs.\r\nThe council adopted a resolution calling for the speediest possible\r\nholding of elections for a constituent assembly.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the _Vollzugsrat_ announced that, in view of the\r\ngarrisons' opposition, orders for the formation of the Red Guard had\r\nbeen rescinded. The Soldiers' Council deposed Captain von Beerfelde, one\r\nof their fourteen representatives on the executive council, \"because he\r\nwas endeavoring to lead the revolution into the course of the radicals.\"\r\nIt was von Beerfelde who, supporting the fourteen workmen's\r\nrepresentatives on the _Vollzugsrat_, had been largely instrumental in\r\nthe original decision to place the capital at the mercy of an armed\r\nrabble.\r\n\r\nThe steadfast attitude of the soldiers was the more astonishing in view\r\nof the great number of deserters in Greater Berlin at this time. Their\r\nnumber has been variously estimated, but it is probable that it reached\r\nnearly sixty thousand. With an impudent shamelessness impossible to\r\nunderstand, even when one realizes what they had suffered, these\r\nself-confessed cowards and betrayers of honest men now had the\r\neffrontery to form a \"Council of Deserters, Stragglers and Furloughed\r\nSoldiers,\" and to demand equal representation on all government bodies\r\nand in the Soviets. Liebknecht played the chief role in organizing these\r\nmen, but Ledebour, already so radical that he was out of sympathy even\r\nwith the reddest Independent Socialists, and certain other Independents\r\nand Spartacans assisted. This was too much for even the revolutionary\r\nand class-conscious soldiers under arms, and nearly a month later at\r\nleast one Berlin regiment still retained enough martial pride to fire on\r\na procession of these traitors.\r\n\r\nIn these deserters and stragglers, and in the thousands of criminals of\r\nevery big city, including those liberated from jails and prisons by the\r\nrevolution, Liebknecht and his lieutenants found tools admirably adapted\r\nto their ends. The Spartacans had already been indirectly recognized as\r\na separate political party in an announcement made by the Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Council on November 11th, which, referring to the seizure of\r\nthe _Lokal-Anzeiger_ by the Spartacans and of the _Norddeutsche\r\nAllgemeine Zeitung_ by the Independents, pointed out that \"all the\r\nSocialist factions in Berlin now have their daily paper.\" The Spartacans\r\nnow organized. Ledebour, an aged fanatic, temperamental, never able to\r\nagree with the tenets or members of any existing party, organized an\r\n\"Association of Revolutionary Foremen,\" which was recruited from the\r\nfactories and made up of violent opponents of democratic government. To\r\nall intents and purposes this association must be reckoned as a wing of\r\nthe Spartacus group. It played a large part in the January and March\r\nuprisings against the government, and throughout strengthened the hands\r\nof the opponents of democracy and the advocates of soviet rule in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nDespite all its initial extravagances, the _bona fides_ of the\r\nEbert-Haase government at this time cannot fairly be questioned. It\r\nhonestly desired to restore order in Germany and to institute a\r\ndemocratic government. With the exception of Barth, the least able and\r\nleast consequential member of the cabinet, all were agreed that a\r\nconstituent assembly must be summoned. Haase and Dittmann, the two\r\nother Independent Socialist members, had not yet begun to coquet with\r\nthe idea of soviet government, although, in the matter of a\r\nconstituent assembly, they were already trying to hunt with the hounds\r\nand run with the hares by favoring its summoning, but demanding that\r\nthe elections therefor be postponed until the people could be\r\n\"enlightened in the Social-Democratic sense.\" This meant, of course,\r\n\"in the Independent Social-Democratic sense,\" which, as we shall see,\r\neventually degenerated into open advocacy of the domination of the\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\nTo this government, facing multifold tasks, inexperienced in ruling,\r\nexisting only on sufferance and at best a makeshift and compromise,\r\nthe armistice of November 11th dealt a terrible moral and material\r\nblow. A wave of stupefied indignation and resentment followed the\r\npublication of its terms, and this feeling was increased by the\r\ngeneral realization of Germany's helplessness. Hard terms had, indeed,\r\nbeen expected, but nothing like these. One of the chief factors that\r\nmade bloodless revolution possible had been the reliance of the great\r\nmass of the German people on the declarations of leaders of enemy\r\npowers--particularly of the United States--that the war was being waged\r\nagainst the German governmental system, the Hohenzollerns and\r\nmilitarism, and not against the people themselves. There can be no doubt\r\nthat these promises of fair treatment for a democratic Germany did\r\nincalculably much to paralyze opposition to the revolution.\r\n\r\nIn the conditions of the armistice the whole nation conceived itself to\r\nhave been betrayed and deceived. Whether this feeling was justified is\r\nnot the part of the historian to decide. It is enough that it existed.\r\nIt was confirmed and strengthened by the fact that the almost unanimous\r\nopinion of neutral lands, including even those that had been the\r\nstrongest sympathizers of the Allied cause, condemned the armistice\r\nterms unqualifiedly, both on ethical and material grounds. It is ancient\r\nhuman experience that popular disaffection first finds its scapegoat in\r\nthe government, and history repeated itself here. The unreflecting\r\nmasses forgot for the moment the government's powerlessness. It saw only\r\nthe abandonment of rich German lands to the enemy, the continuance of\r\nthe \"hunger-blockade\" and, worst of all, the retention by the enemy of\r\nthe German prisoners. Of all the harsh provisions of the armistice, none\r\nother caused so much mental and moral anguish as the realization that,\r\nwhile enemy prisoners were to be sent back to their families, the\r\nGermans, many of whom had been in captivity since the first days of the\r\nwar, must still remain in hostile prison-camps. The authority of the\r\ngovernment that accepted these terms was thus seriously shaken at the\r\nvery outset.\r\n\r\nThe government was as seriously affected materially as morally by the\r\narmistice. During the whole of the last year food and fuel conditions\r\nhad been gravely affected by limited transportation facilities. Now,\r\nwith an army of several millions to be brought home in a brief space of\r\ntime, five thousand locomotives and 150,000 freight cars had to be\r\ndelivered up to the enemy. This was more than a fifth of the entire\r\nrolling stock possessed by Germany at this time. Moreover, nearly half\r\nof all available locomotives and cars were badly in need of repairs, and\r\na considerable percentage of these were in such condition that they\r\ncould not be used at all. Nor was this all. Although nothing had been\r\nstipulated in the armistice conditions regarding the size or character\r\nof the engines to be surrendered, only the larger and more powerful ones\r\nwere accepted. One month later it had been found necessary to transport\r\n810 locomotives to the places agreed upon for their surrender, and of\r\nthese only 206 had been accepted. Of 15,720 cars submitted in the same\r\nperiod, only 9,098 had been accepted. The result was a severe\r\nover-burdening of the German railways.\r\n\r\nWhat this meant for Germany's economic life and for the people generally\r\nbecame apparent in many ways during the winter, and in none more\r\nstriking than in a fuel shortage which brought much suffering to the\r\ninhabitants of the larger cities. The coalfields of the Ruhr district\r\nrequired twenty-five thousand cars daily to transport even their\r\ndiminishing production, but the number available dropped below ten\r\nthousand. Only eight hundred cars were available to care for the\r\nproduction in Upper Silesia, and a minimum of three thousand was\r\nrequired. The effect on the transportation of foodstuffs to the cities\r\ncannot so definitely be estimated, but that it was serious is plain.\r\n\r\nThe armistice provided that the blockade should be maintained. In\r\nreality it was not only maintained, but extended. Some of the most\r\nfertile soil in Germany lies on the left bank of the Rhine, and cities\r\nalong that river had depended on these districts for much of their food.\r\nWith enemy occupation, these supplies were cut off. What this meant was\r\nterribly apparent in Duesseldorf after the occupation had been completed.\r\nDuesseldorf, with a population of nearly 400,000, had depended on the\r\nleft bank of the Rhine for virtually all its dairy products. These were\r\nnow cut off, and the city authorities found themselves able to secure a\r\nmaximum of less than 7,000 quarts of milk daily for the inhabitants.\r\n\r\nA further extension of the blockade came when German fishermen were\r\nforbidden to fish even in their territorial waters in the North Sea and\r\nthe Baltic. The available supply of fish in Germany had already dropped,\r\nas has been described, to a point where it was possible to secure a\r\nration only once in every three or four weeks. And now even this\r\ntrifling supply was no longer available. Vast stores of food were\r\nabandoned, destroyed or sold to the inhabitants of the occupied\r\ndistricts when the armies began the evacuation of France and Belgium,\r\nand millions of soldiers, returning to find empty larders at home,\r\nfurther swelled the ranks of the discontented.\r\n\r\nOnly the old maxim that all is fair in war can explain or justify the\r\ngreat volume of misleading reports that were sent out regarding food\r\nconditions in Germany in the months following the armistice. Men who\r\nwere able to spend a hundred marks daily for their food, or whose\r\nobservations were limited to the most fertile agricultural districts of\r\nGermany, generalized carelessly and reported that there were no\r\nevidences of serious shortage anywhere, except perhaps, in one or two of\r\nthe country's largest cities. Men who knew conditions thoroughly\r\nhesitated to report them because of the supposed exigencies of war and\r\nwartime policies, or, reporting them in despite thereof, saw themselves\r\ndenounced as pro-German propagandists.\r\n\r\nMonths later, when perhaps irreparable damage had been done, the truth\r\nbegan to come out. The following Associated Press dispatch is\r\nsignificant:\r\n\r\n    \"London, July 1.--Germany possessed a sound case in claiming\r\n    early relief, according to reports of British officers who\r\n    visited Silesia in April to ascertain economic conditions\r\n    prevailing in Germany. A white paper issued tonight gives the\r\n    text of their reports and the result of their investigations.\r\n\r\n    \"It is said that there was a genuine shortage of foodstuffs and\r\n    the health of the population had suffered so seriously that the\r\n    working classes had reached such a stage of desperation that\r\n    they could not be trusted to keep the peace.\"\r\n\r\nOne is told officially that the old regime in Russia fell \"because as an\r\nautocracy it did not respond to the democratic demands of the Russian\r\npeople.\"[54] This is an ascription to the Russian people of elevated\r\nsentiments to which they have not the shadow of a claim. The old regime\r\nfell because it did not respond to the demands of the Russian people for\r\nfood. Wilhelm II fell because the Germans were hungry. It was hunger\r\nthat handicapped the efforts of the Ebert-Haase government throughout\r\nits existence and it was hunger that proved the best recruiting agent\r\nfor Liebknecht and the other elements that were trying to make democracy\r\nimpossible in Germany. If any people with experience of hunger were\r\nasked to choose between the absolutism of Peter the Great with bursting\r\ngranaries and the most enlightened democracy with empty bins, democracy\r\nwould go away with its hands as empty as its bins.\r\n\r\n[54] _War Cyclopedia_, issued by the Committee on Public\r\n    Information, p. 241.\r\n\r\n\"Give us this day our daily bread\" is the first material petition in the\r\nprayer of all the Christian peoples of the world, but only those who\r\nhave hungered can realize its deep significance.\r\n\r\nThe fact is not generally known--and will doubtless cause surprise--that\r\na determined effort was made by the American, French and British\r\ngovernments after the armistice to make first-hand independent reporting\r\nof events in Germany impossible. Assistant Secretary of State Polk\r\nfollowed the example of the other governments named by issuing on\r\nNovember 13th an order, which was cabled to all American embassies and\r\nlegations abroad, prohibiting any American journalist from entering\r\nGermany. The State Department refused to issue passports to journalists\r\ndesiring to go to adjoining neutral countries except upon their pledge\r\nnot to enter Germany without permission. Requests for permission were\r\neither denied, or (in some instances) not even acknowledged.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, some American journalists stationed in lands\r\nadjoining Germany, and a few of these, although warned by members of\r\ntheir diplomatic corps, conceived it to be their duty to their papers\r\nand to their people as well, to try to learn the truth about the German\r\nsituation, instead of depending longer upon hearsay and neutral\r\njournalists. Some of the most valuable reports reaching Washington in\r\nthese early days came from men who had disobeyed the State Department's\r\norders, but this did not save at least two of the disobedient ones from\r\nsuffering very real punishment at the hands of resentful officials.\r\n\r\nWhat the purpose of the State Department was in thus attempting to\r\nprevent any but army officers or government officials from reporting on\r\nconditions in Germany the writer does not know. It is probable, however,\r\nthat the initiative did not come from Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n                           \"The New Freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conclusion of the armistice was the signal for a general collapse\r\namong Germany's armed forces. This did not at first affect the troops in\r\nthe trenches, and many of them preserved an almost exemplary spirit and\r\ndiscipline until they reached home, but the men of the _etappe_--the\r\npositions back of the front and at the military bases--threw order and\r\ndiscipline to the winds. It was here that revolutionary propaganda and\r\nred doctrines had secured the most adherents in the army, and the effect\r\nwas quickly seen. Abandoning provisions, munitions and military stores\r\ngenerally, looting and terrifying the people of their own villages and\r\ncities, the troops of the _etappe_ straggled back to the homeland, where\r\nthey were welcomed by the elements responsible for Germany's collapse.\r\n\r\nThe government sent a telegram to the Supreme Army Command, pointing out\r\nthe necessity of an orderly demobilization and emphasizing the chaotic\r\nconditions that would result if army units arbitrarily left their posts.\r\nCommanding officers were directed to promulgate these orders:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Relations between officers and men must rest upon mutual\r\n    confidence. The soldier's voluntary submission to his officer\r\n    and comradely treatment of the soldier by his superior are\r\n    conditions precedent for this.\r\n\r\n    \"2. Officers retain their power of command. Unconditional\r\n    obedience when on duty is of decisive importance if the return\r\n    march to the German homeland is to be successfully carried out.\r\n    Military discipline and order in the armies must be maintained\r\n    in all circumstances.\r\n\r\n    \"3. For the maintenance of confidence between officers and men\r\n    the soldiers' councils have advisory powers in matters relating\r\n    to provisioning, furloughs and the infliction of military\r\n    punishments. It is their highest duty to endeavor to prevent\r\n    disorder and mutiny.\r\n\r\n    \"4. Officers and men shall have the same rations.\r\n\r\n    \"5. Officers and men shall receive the same extra allowances of\r\n    pay and perquisites.\"\r\n\r\n\"Voluntary submission\" by soldiers to officers might be feasible in a\r\nvictorious and patriotic army, but it is impracticable among troops\r\ninfected with Socialist doctrines and retreating before their\r\nconquerors. Authority, once destroyed, can never be regained. This was\r\nproved not only at the front, but at home as well. _Die neue Freiheit_\r\n(the new freedom), a phrase glibly mouthed by all supporters of the\r\nrevolution, assumed the same grotesque forms in Germany as in Russia.\r\nAutomobiles, commandeered by soldiers from army depots or from the royal\r\ngarages, flying red flags, darted through the streets at speeds defying\r\nall regulations, filled with unwashed and unshaven occupants lolling on\r\nthe cushioned seats. Cabmen drove serenely up the left side of Unter den\r\nLinden, twiddling their fingers at the few personally escorted and\r\ndisarmed policemen whom they saw. Gambling games ran openly at\r\nstreet-corners. Soldiers mounted improvised booths in the streets and\r\nsold cigarettes and soap looted from army stores.\r\n\r\nEarnest revolutionaries traveled through the city looking for signs\r\ncontaining the word _kaiserlich_ (imperial) or _koeniglich_ (royal), and\r\nmutilated or destroyed them. Court purveyors took down their signs or\r\ndraped them. The _Kaiser Keller_ in Friedrichstrasse became simply a\r\n_Keller_ and the bust of the Kaiser over the door was covered with a\r\npiece of canvas. The Royal Opera-House became the \"Opera-House Unter den\r\nLinden.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the most outstanding characteristics of the German people in\r\npeace times had been their love of order. Even the superficial observer\r\ncould not help noticing it, and one of its manifestations earned general\r\ncommendation. This was that the unsightly billboards and placarded walls\r\nthat disfigure American cities were never seen in Germany. Neat and\r\nsightly columns were erected in various places for official, theatrical\r\nor business announcements, and no posters might be affixed anywhere\r\nelse. Nothing more strikingly illustrates the character of the collapse\r\nin Germany than the fact that it destroyed even this deeply ingrained\r\nlove of order. _Genossen_ with brushes and paste-pots calmly defaced\r\nhouse-walls and even show windows on main streets with placards whose\r\nquality showed that German art, too, had suffered in the general\r\ncollapse of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThere was something so essentially childish in the manner in which a\r\ngreat part of the people reacted to _die neue Freiheit_ that one is not\r\nsurprised to hear that it also turned juvenile heads. Several hundred\r\nschoolboys and schoolgirls, from twelve to seventeen years old, paraded\r\nthrough the main streets of Berlin, carrying red flags and placards with\r\nincendiary inscriptions. The procession stopped before the Prussian Diet\r\nbuilding, where the Workmen's and Soldiers' Council was in session, and\r\npresented a list of demands. These included the vote for all persons\r\neighteen years old or over, the abolition of corporal punishment and\r\nparticipation by the school-children in the administration of the\r\nschools. The chairman of the _Vollzugsrat_ of the council addressed the\r\njuvenile paraders, and declared that he was in complete sympathy with\r\ntheir demands.\r\n\r\nA seventeen-year-old lad replied with a speech in which he warned the\r\ncouncil that there would be terrible consequences if the demands were\r\nnot granted. The procession then went on to the Reichstag building,\r\nwhere speeches were made by several juvenile orators, demanding the\r\nresignation or removal of Ebert and Scheidemann and threatening a\r\ngeneral juvenile strike if this demand was not accepted immediately.\r\n\r\nEnthusiasm was heightened in the first week of the revolutionary\r\ngovernment's existence by reports that enemy countries were also in the\r\ngrip of revolution. Tuesday's papers published a report that Foch had\r\nbeen murdered, Poincare had fled from Paris and the French government\r\nhad been overthrown. Reports came from Hamburg and Kiel that English\r\nsailors had hoisted the red flag and were fraternizing with German\r\nships' crews on the North Sea. The Soldiers' Council at Paderborn\r\nreported that the red flag had been hoisted in the French trenches from\r\nthe Belgian border to Mons, and that French soldiers were fraternizing\r\nwith the Germans. That these reports found considerable credence throws\r\na certain light on the German psychology of these days. The reaction\r\nwhen they were found to be false further increased the former\r\ndespondency.\r\n\r\nThe six-man cabinet decreed on November 15th the dissolution of the\r\nPrussian Diet and the abolishment of the House of Lords. Replying to a\r\ntelegram from President Fehrenbach of the Reichstag, asking whether the\r\ngovernment intended to prevent the Reichstag from coming together in the\r\nfollowing week, the cabinet telegraphed:\r\n\r\n    \"As a consequence of the political overturn, which has done away\r\n    with the institution of German Kaiserdom as well as with the\r\n    Federal Council in its capacity of a lawgiving body, the\r\n    Reichstag which was elected in 1912 can also not reconvene.\"\r\n\r\nThe cabinet--subject to the control theoretically exercisable by the\r\n_Vollzugsrat_--was thus untrammeled by other legislative or\r\nadministrative institutions. But it was, as we have seen, trammeled from\r\nwithout by the disastrous material conditions in Germany, by the mental\r\nand moral shipwreck of its people, by the peculiar German psychology and\r\nby the political immaturity of the whole nation--a political immaturity,\r\nmoreover, which even certain cabinet members shared. From within the\r\ncabinet was also seriously handicapped from the start by its \"parity\"\r\ncomposition, that is to say, the fact that power was equally divided\r\nbetween Majority and Independent Socialists without a deciding casting\r\nvote in case of disagreement along party lines. If the Independent\r\nSocialist cabinet members and the rank and file of their party had\r\ncomprehended the real character and completeness of the revolution, as\r\nit was comprehended by some of the theorists of the party--notably Karl\r\nKautsky and Eduard Bernstein--and if they had avoided their disastrous\r\nfellowship with Joffe and other Bolshevik agents, the subsequent course\r\nof events would have been different. But they lacked this comprehension\r\nand they had been defiled in handling the pitch of Bolshevism.\r\n\r\nAll the revolutions of the last century and a quarter had been of\r\n_bourgeois_ origin. They had, however, been carried into effect with the\r\naid of the proletariat, since the _bourgeoisie_, being numerically much\r\nweaker than the proletariat, does not command the actual brute force to\r\nmake revolution. At first the _bourgeoisie_, as planners of the\r\noverthrow, took control of the authority of the state and exercised it\r\nfor their own ends. The proletariat, which had learned its own strength\r\nand resources in the revolutionary contests, used its power to compel a\r\nfurther development of the revolution in a more radical direction and\r\neventually compelled the first holders of authority to give way to a\r\ngovernment more responsive to the demands of the lower classes. Thus the\r\nevents of 1789 in Paris were followed by the victory of the Montane\r\nparty, the events of September 4, 1870, by those of March 18, 1871, and\r\nthe Kerensky revolution in Petrograd by the Bolshevik revolution of\r\nNovember, 1917.\r\n\r\nThe German revolution, however, alone among the great revolutions of the\r\nworld, was, as has already been pointed out, both in its origins and\r\nexecution, proletarian and Socialistic. The _bourgeoisie_ had no part in\r\nit and no participation in the revolutionary government. Any attempt to\r\ndevelop the revolution further by overthrowing or opposing the first\r\nrevolutionary government could therefore serve only factional and not\r\nclass interests. Factional clashes were, of course, inevitable. The\r\nmembers of the Paris Commune split into four distinct factions,\r\nJacobins, Blanquists, Proudhonists and a small group of Marxist\r\nInternationalists. But these, bitterly as they attacked each other's\r\nmethods and views, nevertheless presented at all times a united front\r\nagainst the _bourgeoisie_, whereas the German Independent Socialists,\r\nfrom whom better things might have been expected, almost from the\r\nbeginning played into the hands of the Spartacans, from whom nothing\r\ngood could have been expected, and thus seriously weakened the\r\ngovernment and eventually made a violent second phase of the revolution\r\nunavoidable.\r\n\r\nIf it be admitted that Socialist government was the proper form of\r\ngovernment for Germany at this time, it is clear that the Independent\r\nSocialists had a very real mission. This was well expressed in the first\r\nmonth of the revolution in a pamphlet by Kautsky, in which he wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"The extremes (Majority Socialists and Spartacans) can best be\r\n    described thus: the one side (Majority) has not yet completely\r\n    freed itself from _bourgeois_ habits of thought and still has\r\n    much confidence in the _bourgeois_ world, whose inner strength\r\n    it overestimates. The other side (Spartacans) totally lacks all\r\n    comprehension of the _bourgeois_ world and regards it as a\r\n    collection of scoundrels. It despises the mental and economic\r\n    accomplishments of the _bourgeoisie_ and believes that the\r\n    proletarians, without any special knowledge or any kind of\r\n    training, are able to take over immediately all political and\r\n    economic functions formerly exercised by the _bourgeois_\r\n    authorities.\r\n\r\n    \"Between these two extremes we find those (the Independents) who\r\n    have studied the _bourgeois_ world and comprehend it, who regard\r\n    it objectively and critically, but who know how properly to\r\n    value its accomplishments and realize the difficulties of\r\n    replacing it with a better system. This Marxist center must, on\r\n    the one hand, spur the timorous on and awaken the blindly\r\n    confiding, and on the other, put a check upon the blind\r\n    impetuosity of the ignorant and thoughtless. It has the double\r\n    task of driving and applying the brakes.\r\n\r\n    \"These are the three tendencies that contend with each other\r\n    within the ranks of the proletariat.\"\r\n\r\nIndications of the coming split with the cabinet were observable even in\r\nthe first week of the government's existence. Together with its decree\r\ndissolving the Diet, the cabinet announced that \"the national government\r\nis engaged in making preparations for the summoning of a constituent\r\nassembly at the earliest possible moment.\" The overwhelming majority of\r\nthe German people already demanded the convening of such a body. Only\r\nthe Spartacans, who had formally effected organization on November 14th,\r\nopenly opposed it as a party, but there was much anti-assembly sentiment\r\nin Independent Socialist ranks, although the party had as yet taken no\r\nstand against it. Richard Mueller, the dangerous Independent Socialist\r\ndemagogue at the head of the workmen's section of the _Vollzugsrat_, was\r\none of the most rabid opponents of a national assembly and one of the\r\nmen responsible for his party's subsequent opposition to it. Speaking at\r\na meeting of the _Vollzugsrat_ on November 19th he said:\r\n\r\n    \"There is a cry now for a national assembly. The purpose is\r\n    plain. The plan is to use this assembly to rob the proletariat\r\n    of its power and lay it back in the hands of the _bourgeoisie_.\r\n    But it will not succeed. We want no democratic republic. We want\r\n    a social republic.\"\r\n\r\nHaase, speaking for the cabinet, cleverly avoided putting himself on\r\nrecord as to whether or not a national assembly would eventually be\r\ncalled. It could not be called together yet, he said, because\r\npreparations must first be made. Election lists must be drawn up and the\r\nsoldiers in the field must have an opportunity to vote. Moreover, the\r\nsoldiers, who had been \"mentally befogged\" by the pan-German propaganda\r\nat the front, must be \"enlightened\" before they could be permitted to\r\nvote. Large industries must also be socialized before time could be\r\ntaken to summon a _constituante_.\r\n\r\nIt soon became apparent that the work in the cabinet was not going\r\nsmoothly. Ebert, Scheidemann and Landsberg, Socialists though they were,\r\nlacked any trace of that fanaticism which marks so many Socialist\r\nleaders. They were sobered by their new responsibilities. Looked at from\r\nabove, administrative problems presented a different picture from that\r\nwhich they had when viewed from below by men whose chief role had been\r\none of opposition and criticism. Sweeping socialization of all\r\nindustries, regulation of wages and hours of work, the protection of\r\nsociety against criminals, the raising of revenue, the abolishing of\r\ncapitalism and capitalists--these things were less simple than they had\r\nseemed. To socialize the administration of the state was not difficult,\r\nfor that was a mechanism which had been built up. But society, as these\r\nnovices in government now comprehended more clearly than before, is an\r\norganism which has grown up. The product of centuries of growth cannot\r\nbe recklessly made over in a few weeks.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialist trio, realizing the impracticability of tearing\r\ndown old institutions before there was something better to take their\r\nplace, moved slowly in instituting reforms. This was little to the\r\nliking of the radicals within and without the cabinet. Haase,\r\npolitician before all else, and Dittmann, class-conscious fanatic,\r\ninsisted on speedier reforms along orthodox Socialist lines, and\r\nparticularly on a far-reaching socialization of big industries. Nearly\r\na year earlier Haase, Cohn and Ledebour, attending the notorious Joffe\r\nbanquet, had approved Bolshevik attacks on the Majority Socialists and\r\nexcused the slow progress of the revolutionary propaganda by saying\r\nthat \"those--Eberts and Scheidemanns\" could not be brought to see\r\nreason. It was hardly to be expected that the Independents would be\r\nmilder now. The work of the cabinet was hampered already, although the\r\nIndependent members kept up a pretense of working with the old party's\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\nHaase, Dittmann and Barth were supported by the _Vollzugsrat_. This\r\nbody, which had started out by ordering the restoration to their\r\nowners of the newspapers seized during the revolution, had so far\r\nfaced about two days later that Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg were\r\nable to exhibit to the publishers of the _Lokal-Anzeiger_ an order from\r\nthe _Vollzugsrat_ directing them to place their plant at the disposal\r\nof the Spartacans for the printing of _Die rote Fahne_, whose editor\r\nthe Luxemburg woman was to be. The order did not even hint at any\r\ncompensation for the publishers. Naturally they refused flatly to obey\r\nit, and the Greater Berlin Soldiers' Council, still dominated by men of\r\nthe better sort, meeting two days later, indignantly denounced the\r\naction of the _Vollzugsrat_ and compelled the withdrawal of the order.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that the Majority and Independent Socialists were\r\nevenly represented on this council, the latter dominated it. Brutus\r\nMolkenbuhr, the Majority Socialist co-chairman with Richard Mueller was\r\nno match for his fanatic colleague, and most of the other members were\r\nnobodies of at most not more than average intelligence. A more poorly\r\nequipped body of men never ruled any great state, and whatever of good\r\nwas accomplished by the cabinet in the first month of its existence was\r\naccomplished against the opposition of a majority of these men. Mueller's\r\nradicalism grew daily greater. \"The way to a national assembly must lead\r\nover my dead body\" he declared in a speech filled with braggadocio, and\r\nhis hearers applauded.\r\n\r\nThe Soldiers' Council noted with increasing displeasure the drift of the\r\n_Vollzugsrat_ toward the left. At the end of November, after a stormy\r\nsession, the council adopted a resolution expressing dissatisfaction\r\nwith the attitude of the _Vollzugsrat_ and appointing one representative\r\nfrom each of the seven regiments stationed in Berlin to weigh charges\r\nagainst the executive council and, if necessary, to reform it. The\r\nresolution charged the _Vollzugsrat_ with holding secret sessions,\r\nusurping powers, grafting, nepotism,[55] failure to take steps to\r\nprotect the country's eastern border against the aggressions of the\r\nPoles and hindering all practical work.\r\n\r\n[55] A long chapter could be written upon this subject alone. The\r\n    trail of German revolutionary governments (but not the\r\n    national cabinet) is slimy with graft, robbery and nepotism.\r\n    Eichhorn, in the two months that he held the office of\r\n    Berlin's Police President, made not a single one of the daily\r\n    reports required of him and never accounted for moneys\r\n    passing through his hands. Himself drawing salary from\r\n    _Rosta_ and also as police-president, he appointed his wife\r\n    to a highly paid clerkship and his young daughter drew a\r\n    salary for receiving visitors. An Independent Socialist\r\n    minister's wife drew a large salary for no services. The\r\n    _Vollzugsrat_ employed a hundred stenographers and messengers\r\n    who had nothing to do except draw their salaries. The _53er\r\n    Ausschuss_, a committee of marines and soldiers which took\r\n    entire charge of the admiralty and conducted its affairs\r\n    without any regard to the national government, voted itself\r\n    sums larger than had been required to pay all the salaries of\r\n    the whole department in other days. The police captain of a\r\n    Berlin suburb, a youthful mechanic, received ninety marks a\r\n    day, his wife was made a clerk at fifty marks, and he\r\n    demanded and received an automobile for his private use. The\r\n    first revolutionary military commandant of Munich tried to\r\n    defraud a bank of 44,000 marks on worthless paper. The\r\n    _Vollzugsrat_ never made an honest accounting for the\r\n    tremendous sums used by it. Hundreds of soldiers' and\r\n    workmen's committees constituted themselves into soviets in\r\n    tiny villages and paid themselves daily salaries equaling the\r\n    highest weekly pay that any of them had ever earned. Robbery\r\n    through official requisition became so common that the people\r\n    had to be warned against honoring any requisitions.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Socialists' ascendancy in the executive body was assured\r\non December 5th, when an election was held to fill two vacancies among\r\nthe soldier members. Two Independents were chosen, which gave that party\r\nsixteen of the council's twenty-eight members.\r\n\r\nEven by this time the shift of sentiment in the ranks of Independent\r\nSocialism had proceeded to a point where this party's continued\r\nascendancy would have been as great a menace to democratic government\r\nas would Liebknecht's Spartacans. Adolph Hoffmann, the party's Prussian\r\nMinister of Cults, openly declared that if an attempt were made to\r\nsummon the national assembly it must never be permitted to meet, even\r\nif it had to be dispersed as the Russian Bolsheviki dispersed the\r\nconstituent assembly in Petrograd, and his pronouncement was hailed\r\nwith delight by _Die Freiheit_, the party's official organ in Berlin,\r\nand by Independents generally. Emil Eichhorn, who was once one of the\r\neditors of _Vorwaerts_ but now prominent in the Independent Socialist\r\nparty, and who had been appointed police-president of Berlin, was on\r\nthe payroll of _Rosta_, the Russian telegraph agency which served as a\r\ncentral for the carrying on of Bolshevik propaganda in Germany. He did\r\nas much as any other man to make the subsequent fighting and bloodshed\r\nin Berlin possible by handing out arms and ammunition to Liebknecht's\r\nfollowers, and by dismissing from the city's Republican Guard--the\r\nsoldier-policemen appointed to assist and control the policemen--men\r\nloyal to the new government.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans were feverishly active. Liebknecht and his lieutenants\r\norganized and campaigned tirelessly. _Der rote Soldatenbund_ (the Red\r\nSoldiers' League) was formed from deserters and criminals and armed with\r\nweapons furnished by Eichhorn from the police depots, stolen from\r\ngovernment stores or bought with money furnished by Russian agents. The\r\nfunds received from this source were sufficient also to enable the\r\nSpartacan leaders to pay their armed supporters twenty marks a day, a\r\nsum which proved a great temptation to many of the city's unemployed\r\nwhose sufferings had overcome their scruples.\r\n\r\nThe first demonstration of strength by the Spartacans came on November\r\n26th, when they forcibly seized the Piechatzek Crane Works and the\r\nImperator Motor Company, both big Berlin plants. Spartacan employees\r\nassisted Liebknecht's red soldiery to throw the management out. The\r\nfunds and books of both plants were seized, soldiers remained in charge\r\nand plans were made to run the plants for the sole benefit of the\r\nworkers. The cabinet ordered the plants restored to their owners, and\r\nthe order was obeyed after it became apparent that the _Vollzugsrat_,\r\nalthough in sympathy with the usurpers, did not dare oppose the cabinet\r\non such an issue.\r\n\r\nThe openly revolutionary attitude of the Liebknecht cohorts and their\r\ninsolent defiance of the government, resulted in armed guards being\r\nstationed in front of all public buildings in Berlin. But here was again\r\nexhibited that peculiar unpractical kink in the Socialist mentality: the\r\nguards were directed not to shoot!\r\n\r\nThe reason for the existence of this kink will be apparent to one who\r\nhas read carefully the preceding chapters regarding Socialism's origin\r\nand the passages therein reporting the attitude of the two wings of the\r\nparty in the Reichstag following Admiral von Capelle's charges in the\r\nautumn of 1917. The first article in the Socialist creed is solidarity.\r\n\"Proletarians of all lands: Unite!\" cried Marx and Engels in their\r\nCommunist Manifesto seven decades ago. The average Socialist brings to\r\nhis party an almost religious faith; for hundreds of thousands Socialism\r\nis their only religion. All members of the party are their \"comrades,\"\r\nthe sheep of one fold, and their common enemies are the _bourgeois_\r\nelements of society, the wolves. Black sheep there may be in the fold,\r\nbut they are, after all, sheep, and like must not slaughter like,\r\n_Genossen_ must not shoot _Genossen_.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of the government were to learn later by bitter\r\nexperience that some sheep are worse than wolves, but they had not yet\r\nlearned it. Spartacans coolly disarmed the four guards placed at the old\r\npalace in Unter den Linden and stole their guns. They disarmed the\r\nguards at the Chancellor's Palace, the seat of the government, picked\r\nthe pockets and stole the lunch of the man in charge of the machine-gun\r\nthere, and took the machine-gun away in their automobile. They staged a\r\ndemonstration against Otto Wels, a Majority Socialist who had been\r\nappointed city commandant, and had no difficulty in invading his private\r\nquarters because the guards posted in front had orders not to shoot and\r\nwere simply brushed aside. When the demonstration was ended, the\r\nSpartacans proceeded on their way rejoicing, taking with them the arms\r\nof the government soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans were by this time well equipped with rifles, revolvers\r\nand ammunition, and had a large number of machine-guns. They secured one\r\nauto-truck full of these from the government arsenal at Spandau on a\r\nforged order. They even had a few light field guns and two or three\r\nminethrowers. In the absence of any opposition except the futile\r\ndenunciations of the _bourgeois_ press and the _Vorwaerts_, their numbers\r\nwere increasing daily and they were rapidly fortifying themselves in\r\nvarious points of vantage. Neukoelln, one of the cities making up Greater\r\nBerlin, was already completely in their power. The Workmen's and\r\nSoldiers' Council of this city consisted of seventy-eight men, all of\r\nwhom were Spartacans. This council forcibly dissolved the old city\r\ncouncil, drove the mayor from the city hall and constituted itself the\r\nsole legislative and administrative organ in the city. A decree was\r\nissued imposing special taxes upon all non-Socialist residents, and\r\nmerchants were despoiled by requisitions enforced by armed hooligans.\r\n\r\nThe \"Council of Deserters, Stragglers and Furloughed Soldiers\" announced\r\na number of meetings for the afternoon of December 6th to enforce a\r\ndemand for participation in the government. The largest of these\r\nmeetings was held in the Germania Hall in the Chausseestrasse, just\r\nabove Invalidenstrasse and near the barracks of the _Franzer_, as the\r\nKaiser Franz Regiment was popularly known. The main speaker was a man\r\nintroduced as \"Comrade Schultz,\" but whose Hebraic features indicated\r\nthat this was a revolutionary pseudonym. He had hardly finished\r\noutlining the demands of \"us deserters\" when word came that the\r\n_Vollzugsrat_ had been arrested. It developed later that some misguided\r\npatriots of the old school had actually made an attempt to arrest the\r\nmembers of this council, which had developed into such a hindrance to\r\nhonest government, but the attempt failed.\r\n\r\nThe report, however, threw the meeting into great excitement. A\r\nmotion to adjourn and march to the Chancellor's Palace to protest\r\nagainst the supposed arrest was carried and the crowd started\r\nmarching down Chausseestrasse, singing the laborers' Marseillaise.\r\nAt the same time the crowd present at a similar meeting in a hall a\r\nfew blocks away started marching up Chausseestrasse to join the\r\nGermania Hall demonstrants. Both processions found their way blocked\r\nby a company of _Franzer_, drawn up in front of their barracks, standing\r\nat \"ready\" and with bayonets fixed. The officer in command ordered the\r\nparaders to stop:\r\n\r\n    \"Come on!\" cried the leaders of the demonstration. \"They won't\r\n    shoot their comrades!\"\r\n\r\nBut the _Franzer_ had not yet been \"enlightened.\" A rattling volley rang\r\nout and the deserters, stragglers and furloughed paraders fled. Fifteen\r\nof them lay dead in the street and one young woman aboard a passing\r\nstreet car was also killed.\r\n\r\nThe incident aroused deep indignation not only among the Spartacans,\r\nbut among the Independent Socialists as well. The bulk of the\r\nIndependents were naturally excited over the killing of \"comrades,\" and\r\nthe leaders saw in it a welcome opportunity further to shake the\r\nauthority of the Majority Socialist members of the government. Even the\r\n_Vorwaerts_, hesitating between love and duty, apologetically demanded an\r\ninvestigation. The government eventually shook off all responsibility\r\nand it was placed on the shoulders of an over-zealous officer acting\r\nwithout instructions. This may have been--indeed, probably was--the\r\ncase. The cabinet's record up to this time makes it highly improbable\r\nthat any of its members had yet begun to understand that there are\r\nlimits beyond which no government can with impunity permit its authority\r\nto be flouted.\r\n\r\nThe day following the shooting saw the first of those demonstrations\r\nthat later became so common. Liebknecht summoned a meeting in the\r\nSiegesallee in the Tiergarten. Surrounded by motor-trucks carrying\r\nmachine-guns manned by surly ruffians, he addressed the assembled\r\nthousands, attacking the government, demanding its forcible overthrow\r\nand summoning his hearers to organize a Red Guard.\r\n\r\nIt is significant that, although actual adherents of Spartacus in Berlin\r\ncould at this time be numbered in thousands, tens of thousands attended\r\nthe meeting. Between the Spartacans and thousands of Independent\r\nSocialists of the rank and file there were already only tenuous dividing\r\nlines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n                  The Majority Socialists in Control.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Independent Socialist trio in the cabinet had been compelled to give\r\nup--at least outwardly--their opposition to the summoning of a national\r\nassembly. Popular sentiment too plainly demanded such a congress to make\r\nit possible to resist the demand. Also the Majority members of the\r\ncabinet had been strengthened by two occurrences early in December.\r\nJoffe, the former Russian Bolshevik ambassador, had published his\r\ncharges against Haase, Barth and Cohn, and, although these were merely a\r\nconfirmation of what was generally suspected or even definitely known by\r\nmany, they had an ugly look in the black and white of a printed page and\r\nfound a temporary reaction which visibly shook the authority of these\r\nmen who had accepted foreign funds to overthrow their government.\r\n\r\nThe other factor strengthening the hands of Ebert, Scheidemann and\r\nLandsberg was the manner of the return of the German front-soldiers.\r\n\r\nGratifying reports had come of the conduct of these men on their\r\nhomeward march. Where the soldiers of the _etappe_ had thrown discipline\r\nand honor to the winds and straggled home, a chaotic collection of\r\nlooters, the men who, until noon on November 11th, had kept up the\r\nunequal struggle against victorious armies, brought back with them some\r\nof the spirit that kept them at their hopeless posts. They marched in\r\ngood order, singing the old songs, and scores of reports came of rough\r\ntreatment meted out by them to misguided _Genossen_ who tried to compel\r\nthem to substitute the red flag for their national or state flags, or\r\nfor their regimental banners.\r\n\r\nThe first returning soldiers poured through the Brandenburger Tor on\r\nDecember 10th. A victorious army could not have comported itself\r\ndifferently. The imperial black-white-red, the black-and-white of\r\nPrussia, the white-and-blue of Bavaria and the flags of other states\r\nfloated from the ranks of the veterans. Flowers decked their helmets.\r\nFlowers and evergreens covered gun-carriages and caissons, flowers\r\npeeped from the muzzles of the rifles. Women, children and old men\r\ntrudged alongside, cheering, laughing, weeping. Time was for the moment\r\nrolled back. It was not December, 1918, but August, 1914.\r\n\r\nThe people greeted the troops as if they were a conquering army. They\r\njammed the broad Unter den Linden; cheering and handclapping were almost\r\ncontinuous. The red flags had disappeared from the buildings along the\r\nstreet and been replaced by the imperial or Prussian colors. Only the\r\n_Kultusministerium_, presided over by Adolph Hoffmann, illiterate\r\ndirector of schools and atheistic master of churches, stayed red. The\r\nflag of revolution floated over it and a huge red carpet hung\r\nchallengingly from a second-story window.\r\n\r\nIt was evident on this first day, as also on the following days, that\r\nred doctrines had not yet destroyed discipline and order. The men\r\nmarched with the cadenced step of veterans, their ranks were correctly\r\naligned, their rifles snapped from hand to shoulder at the command of\r\ntheir officers. The bands blared national songs as the long lines of\r\nfield-gray troops defiled through the central arch of the great gate,\r\nonce sacredly reserved for the royal family.\r\n\r\nA hush fell on the waiting crowds. The soldiers' helmets came off. A\r\nmassed band played softly and a chorus of school-children sang the old\r\nGerman anthem:\r\n\r\n            _Wie sie so sanft ruh'n,\r\n            Alle die Seligen,\r\n            In ihren Graebern._\r\n\r\nEbert delivered the address of welcome, which was followed by three\r\ncheers for \"the German Republic.\" It was no time for cheers for the\r\n\"German Socialist Republic.\" The soldiers had not yet been\r\n\"enlightened.\"\r\n\r\nThe scenes of this first day were repeated on each day of the week. The\r\nself-respecting, sound attitude of the front-soldiers angered the\r\nSpartacans and Independents, but was hailed with delight by the great\r\nmajority of the people. The _Vollzugsrat_, resenting the fact that it\r\nhad not been asked, as the real governing body of Germany, to take part\r\nofficially in welcoming the soldiers, sent one of its members to deliver\r\nan address of welcome. He had hardly started when bands began to play,\r\nofficers shouted out commands, the men's rifles sprang to their\r\nshoulders and they marched away, leaving him talking to an empty square.\r\n\r\nThe six-man cabinet announced that a national assembly would be\r\nconvened. The date tentatively fixed for the elections was February 2d,\r\nwhich was a compromise, for the Majority Socialists wanted an earlier\r\ndate, while the Independent trio desired April. It was announced also\r\nthat a central congress of all Germany's workmen's and soldiers'\r\ncouncils had been summoned to meet in Berlin on December 16th. This\r\ncongress was to have power to fix the date for the national assembly and\r\nto make the necessary preparations.\r\n\r\nNo definite rules were laid down covering the manner of choosing\r\ndelegates to the congress. Despite the consequent possibility that the\r\nelections of delegates would be manipulated by the less scrupulous\r\nSpartacans and Independents, the congress chosen was a remarkably\r\nrepresentative body. The numerical weakness of the two radical wings of\r\nSocialism found striking illustration in the makeup of the congress. Of\r\nits total membership of some four hundred and fifty, the Spartacans and\r\nIndependents together had only about forty delegates. That this\r\naccurately represented the proportionate strengths of the conservative\r\nand the radical camps was proved at the elections for the national\r\nassembly a month later, when the Independents, with four per cent of the\r\ntotal popular vote, again had one-eleventh of the Majority Socialists'\r\nforty-four per cent. In considering the role played by the radicals in\r\nthe second phase of the revolution it must be remembered that the\r\nmajority of their strength lay in Berlin, where they eventually won a\r\ngreater following than that of the old party. If Berlin and the free\r\ncities of Hamburg and Bremen could have been isolated from the empire\r\nand allowed to go their own way, ordered government in Germany would\r\nhave come months sooner.[56]\r\n\r\n[56] It is not merely in very recent times that the largest\r\n    cities have become the strongholds of radicalism. In a\r\n    session of the Prussian Diet on March 20, 1852, a deputy\r\n    charged the government with lack of confidence in the people.\r\n    Bismarck replied: \"The deputy having declared here that the\r\n    government distrusts the people, I can say to him that it is\r\n    true that I distrust the inhabitants of the larger cities so\r\n    long as they let themselves be led by self-seeking and lying\r\n    demagogues, but that I do not find the real people there. If\r\n    the larger cities rise up again in rebellion, the real people\r\n    will have ways of bringing them to obedience, even if these\r\n    must include wiping them off the face of the earth.\"\r\n\r\nThe following account of the sessions of the central congress is copied\r\nfrom the author's diary of those days. There is nothing to add to or\r\ntake from the estimates and comments set down at that time.\r\n\r\n    \"December 16th. The Central Congress of Germany's Workmen's and\r\n    Soldiers' Councils convened today in the _Abgeordnetenhaus_\r\n    (Prussian Diet). There are about four hundred and fifty\r\n    delegates present, including two women. There is a fair\r\n    sprinkling of intelligent faces in the crowd, and the average of\r\n    intelligence and manners is far above that of the Berlin\r\n    Soldiers' Council. None of the delegates keeps his hat on in the\r\n    chamber and a few who have started smoking throw their cigars\r\n    and cigarettes away at the request of the presiding officer,\r\n    Leinert from Hanover, who was for some years a member of the\r\n    Prussian Diet and is a man of ability and some parliamentary\r\n    training.\r\n\r\n    \"After organization, which is effected with a show of\r\n    parliamentary form, Richard Mueller, chairman of the executive\r\n    committee of the _Vollzugsrat_, mounts the speaker's tribune to\r\n    give an extended report of the committee's activities. The\r\n    report, which turns out to be really a defense of the committee,\r\n    gets a cool reception. The _Vollzugsrat_ has drifted steadily to\r\n    the left ever since it was appointed, and is strongly\r\n    Independent Socialist and Spartacan, and it is already evident\r\n    that the Majority Socialists have an overwhelming majority in\r\n    the Congress.\r\n\r\n    \"Chairman Leinert interrupts Mueller's speech with an\r\n    announcement that a _Genosse_ has an important communication to\r\n    make. A man who declares that he speaks 'in the name of at least\r\n    250,000 of Berlin's proletariat, now assembled before this\r\n    building,' reads a series of demands. The first, calling for the\r\n    strengthening of the socialist republic, is greeted with general\r\n    applause, but then come the familiar Spartacan (Bolshevik)\r\n    demands for the disarming of the _bourgeoisie_, weaponing of\r\n    'the revolutionary proletariat,' formation of a Red Guard (loud\r\n    cries of 'No!'), and 'all power to remain in the hands of the\r\n    workmen's and soldiers' councils.' In other words, the Russian\r\n    Soviet republic.\r\n\r\n    \"A half dozen officer-delegates present join in the protests\r\n    against the demands. Loud cries of '_raus die Offiziere!_' (out\r\n    with the officers!) come from a little group of Spartacans and\r\n    Independent Socialists at the right of the room. Order is\r\n    finally restored and Mueller completes his defense of the\r\n    _Vollzugsrat_.\r\n\r\n    \"A delegate moves that 'Comrades Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg\r\n    be invited to attend the session as guests with advisory powers,\r\n    in view of their great services to the revolution.'[57] The\r\n    motion is voted down, five to one. It is renewed in the\r\n    afternoon, but meets the same fate, after a turbulent scene in\r\n    which the Spartacans and their Independent Socialist allies howl\r\n    and shout insults at the top of their voices.\r\n\r\n    [57] Neither Liebknecht nor Luxemburg had been chosen as\r\n         delegate, although desperate efforts were made to have\r\n         them elected.\r\n\r\n    \"Liebknecht, who has entered the building while this was going\r\n    on, addresses his followers in the street in front from the\r\n    ledge of a third-story window. The '250,000 of Berlin's\r\n    proletariat' prove to be about seven thousand, nearly half of\r\n    them women and girls and a great majority of the rest\r\n    down-at-the-heels youths. His speech is the usual Bolshevik\r\n    rodomontade. A middle-aged workman who leaves the crowd with me\r\n    tells me:\r\n\r\n        \"'Two-thirds of the people there are there because they\r\n        have to come or lose their jobs. One has to eat, you know.'\r\n\r\n    \"I learned later in the day that many of the paraders had been\r\n    induced to attend by the representation that it was to be a\r\n    demonstration in favor of the national assembly. It is also\r\n    asserted that others were forced by Spartacans with drawn\r\n    revolvers to leave their factories.\r\n\r\n    \"December 17th. The second day's session of the Congress was\r\n    marked by a virulent attack on Ebert by Ledebour, between whom\r\n    and Liebknecht there is little difference. The reception of his\r\n    speech by the delegates again demonstrated that the Majority\r\n    Socialists make up nine-tenths of the assembly. Barth also took\r\n    it upon himself to attack Ebert and to disclose secrets of the\r\n    inner workings of the cabinet. Ebert answered with an indignant\r\n    protest against being thus attacked from the rear. Barth has the\r\n    lowest mentality of all the six cabinet members, and I am\r\n    informed on good authority that he has an unsavory record. His\r\n    alleged offenses are of a nature regarded by advanced\r\n    penologists as pathological rather than criminal, but however\r\n    that may be, he seems hardly fitted for participation in any\r\n    governing body.\r\n\r\n    \"Liebknecht's followers staged another demonstration like that\r\n    of yesterday. The Congress had decided that no outsiders should\r\n    be permitted again to interrupt the proceedings, but a\r\n    delegation of some forty men and women from the Schwarzkopff,\r\n    Knorr and other red factories, bearing banners inscribed with\r\n    Bolshevik demands, insisted on entering and nobody dared oppose\r\n    them. They filed onto the platform and read their stock\r\n    resolutions, cheered by the little group of their soul-brothers\r\n    among the deputies and by fanatics in the public galleries.\r\n    Beyond temporarily interrupting the proceedings of the Congress\r\n    they accomplished nothing.\r\n\r\n    \"The incompetence--to use no stronger word--of the _Vollzugsrat_\r\n    was again demonstrated today, as well as its careless financial\r\n    methods.\r\n\r\n    \"December 18th. A well-dressed German who stands beside me in\r\n    the diplomatic gallery insists on explaining to all occupants of\r\n    the gallery that it is intolerable that the speaker now in the\r\n    tribune should be permitted to speak of the late 'revolt.' 'It\r\n    was not a revolt; it was a revolution, and they ought to compel\r\n    him to call it that,' he says. How typical of the mentality of a\r\n    great number of the delegates themselves! They have spent\r\n    precious hours discussing Marx and Bebel and the brotherhood of\r\n    man--which, however, appears to extend only to the\r\n    proletariat--but only two or three clear heads have talked of\r\n    practical things. The failure of the Socialists generally to\r\n    realize that it is not now a question of doing what they would\r\n    like to do, but what they must do, is extraordinary and amazing.\r\n    One speaker has read nearly a chapter from one of Bebel's books.\r\n    Only a few leaders are clear-sighted enough to insist that it is\r\n    more important just now to save Germany from disintegration and\r\n    the German people from starvation than to impose the doctrines\r\n    of internationalism upon a world not yet ready for them. The\r\n    members of the average high school debating club in any American\r\n    city have a keener sense for practical questions than has the\r\n    great majority of this Congress.[58]\r\n\r\n    [58] This may appear to be an extravagant comparison, but it\r\n        is so near the truth that I let it stand.\r\n\r\n    \"December 19th. The Congress tonight changed the date for the\r\n    National Assembly from February 16th to January 19th. Hardly\r\n    forty of the delegates opposed the change. These\r\n    forty--Independents and Spartacans--tried vainly to have a\r\n    resolution passed committing Germany to the Russian Soviet\r\n    system, but the vast majority would have none of it. Haase spoke\r\n    in favor of the National Assembly. If he maintains this course\r\n    his cooperation with the three Majority members of the cabinet\r\n    will be valuable, but he is a trimmer and undependable.\r\n\r\n    \"The Congress was enabled by a bolt of the Independents to\r\n    accomplish another valuable bit of work, viz., the appointment\r\n    of a new central _Vollzugsrat_ made up entirely of Majority\r\n    Socialists. It includes some excellent men, notably Cohen of\r\n    Reuss, whose speech in advocacy of the National Assembly and of\r\n    changing its date has been the most logical and irrefutable\r\n    speech made during the Congress, and Leinert, first chairman of\r\n    the Congress. With the support of this new executive committee\r\n    the cabinet will have no excuse if it continues to shilly-shally\r\n    along and fails to exhibit some backbone.\r\n\r\n    \"But I am apprehensive. A scraggly-bearded fanatic in one of the\r\n    public galleries today repeatedly howled insults at Majority\r\n    Socialist speakers, and, although repeated remonstrances were\r\n    made, nobody had enough energy or courage to throw him out.\r\n    Leinert once threatened to clear the galleries if the\r\n    demonstrations there were repeated. The spectators promptly\r\n    responded with hoots, hisses and the shaking of fists, but the\r\n    galleries were not cleared.\r\n\r\n    \"German government in miniature! The same mentality that places\r\n    guards before public buildings and orders them not to use their\r\n    weapons! _Sancta simplicitas!_\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the foregoing report, comparatively lengthy\r\nthough it is, fails to record an amount of legislative business\r\ncommensurate with the length of the session. And yet there is little to\r\nadd to it, for but two things of importance were done--the alteration of\r\nthe date for holding the elections for the National Assembly and the\r\nappointment of the new _Vollzugsrat_. Outside this the accomplishments\r\nof the Congress were mainly along the line of refusing to yield to\r\nIndependent and Spartacan pressure designed to anchor the soviet scheme\r\nin the government. New light is thrown on the old _Vollzugsrat_ by the\r\nfact that it had invited the Russian Government to send delegates to the\r\nCongress. The cabinet had learned of this in time, and a week before the\r\nCongress was to assemble it sent a wireless message to Petrograd, asking\r\nthe government to abstain from sending delegates \"in view of the present\r\nsituation in Germany.\" The Russians nevertheless tried to come, but were\r\nstopped at the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which Haase and Dittmann had supported their Majority\r\nSocialist colleagues in the cabinet by their speeches during the\r\nCongress had demonstrated that, while there were differences between the\r\ntwo groups, they were not insurmountable. The events of the week\r\nfollowing the Congress of Soviets, however, altered the situation\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nIt has been related how, in the days preceding the actual revolution in\r\nBerlin, the so-called \"People's Marine Division\" had been summoned to\r\nthe capital to protect the government. It was quartered in the Royal\r\nStables and the Royal Palace, and was entrusted with the custody of the\r\nPalace and its treasures.\r\n\r\nIt speedily became apparent that a wolf had been placed in charge of the\r\nsheepfold. The division, which had originally consisted of slightly more\r\nthan six hundred men, gradually swelled to more than three thousand,\r\ndespite the fact that no recruiting for it nor increase in its numbers\r\nhad been authorized. A great part of the men performed no service\r\nwhatever, terrorized inoffending people, and, as investigation by the\r\nFinance Ministry disclosed, stole everything movable in the Palace.\r\n\r\nThe division demanded that it be permitted to increase its numbers to\r\nfive thousand and that it be made a part of the Republican Soldier Guard\r\nin charge of the city's police service. This demand was refused by the\r\nCity Commandant, Otto Wels, since the ranks of the Soldier Guard were\r\nalready full. A compromise was eventually reached by which those of the\r\ndivision who had formerly been employed on police duty and who were\r\nfathers of families and residents of Berlin, would be added to the\r\npolice force if the Marine Division would surrender the keys to the\r\nPalace which it was looting. The Marines agreed to this, but failed to\r\nsurrender the keys. On December 21st a payment of eighty thousand marks\r\nwas to be made to them for their supposed services. Wels refused to hand\r\nover the money until the keys to the Palace had been surrendered.\r\n\r\nWels had incurred the deep hatred of the more radical elements of the\r\ncapital by his sturdy opposition to lawlessness. He was almost the\r\nonly Majority Socialist functionary who had displayed unbending energy\r\nin his efforts to uphold the authority of the government, and public\r\ndemonstrations against him had already been held, in which he was\r\nclassed with Ebert and Scheidemann as a \"bloodhound.\" The leaders of the\r\nMarine Division decided reluctantly to give up the Palace keys, but they\r\nwould not hand them over to the hated Wels. Early in the afternoon of\r\nDecember 23d they sought out Barth, the member of the cabinet who stood\r\nclosest to them, and gave the keys to him. Barth telephoned to Wels that\r\nthe keys had been surrendered. Wels pointed out that Ebert was the\r\nmember of the cabinet in charge of military affairs, and declared that\r\nhe would pay out the eighty thousand marks only upon receipt of advices\r\nthat the keys were in Ebert's possession.\r\n\r\nThe delivery to Barth of the keys had been entrusted two marines who\r\nconstituted the military post at the Chancellor's Palace. These men,\r\ninformed of Wels's attitude, occupied the telephone central in the\r\npalace, and informed Ebert and Landsberg that Dorrenbach, their\r\ncommander, had ordered that no one be permitted to leave or enter the\r\nbuilding. An hour later, at five-thirty o'clock, the Marines left the\r\nbuilding, but in the evening the whole division appeared before the\r\npalace and occupied it.\r\n\r\nGovernment troops, summoned by telephone, also appeared, and an armed\r\nclash appeared imminent. Ebert, however, finally induced the Marines to\r\nleave on condition that the government troops also left.\r\n\r\nWhile this was going on, a detachment of Marines had entered Wels's\r\noffice, compelled him at the point of their guns to pay out the eighty\r\nthousand marks due them, and had then marched him to the Royal Stables,\r\nwhere he was locked up in a cellar and threatened with death. Ebert,\r\nScheidemann and Landsberg, without consulting their colleagues, ordered\r\nthe Minister of War to employ all force necessary for the release of\r\nWels. At the last moment, however, negotiations were entered into and\r\nWels was released shortly after midnight on the Marines' terms.\r\n\r\nSpartacans and radical Independents took the part of the Marines.\r\nRichard Mueller, Ledebour, Daeumig and other members of the defunct\r\noriginal _Vollzugsrat_ were galvanized into new opposition. Ledebour's\r\n\"Revolutionary Foremen of Greater Berlin Industries\" demanded the\r\nretirement of the Independent Socialist members of the cabinet, and the\r\ndemand was approvingly published by _Die Freiheit_, the party's official\r\norgan. The head and forefront of the Majority cabinet members' offending\r\nwas their order to the War Minister to use force in upholding the\r\ngovernment's authority, and radical revolutionists condemn force when it\r\nis employed against themselves.\r\n\r\nThe position of Haase and Dittmann as party leaders was seriously\r\nshaken. The left wing of their party, led by Eichhorn and Ledebour, was\r\non the point of disavowing them as leaders and even as members of the\r\nparty. At the party's caucuses in Greater Berlin on December 26th, held\r\nto nominate candidates for delegates to the coming National Assembly,\r\nLedebour refused to permit his name to be printed on the same ticket\r\nwith Haase's, and Eichhorn secured 326 votes to 271 for the party's\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of the same day the Independents in the cabinet submitted\r\neight formulated questions to the _Vollzugsrat_, in which this body was\r\nasked to define its attitude as to various matters. The _Vollzugsrat_\r\nanswered a majority of the questions in a sense favorable to the\r\nIndependents. Its answer to one important question, however, gave the\r\nIndependents the pretext for which they were looking. The question ran:\r\n\r\n    \"Does the _Vollzugsrat_ approve that the cabinet members Ebert,\r\n    Scheidemann and Lansberg on the night of December 23d conferred\r\n    upon the Minister of War the authority, in no manner limited, to\r\n    employ military force against the People's Marine Division in\r\n    the Palace and Stables?\"\r\n\r\nThe executive council's answer was:\r\n\r\n    \"The people's commissioners merely gave the order to do what was\r\n    necessary to liberate Comrade Wels. Nor was this done until\r\n    after the three commissioners had been advised by telephone by\r\n    the leader of the People's Marine Division that he could not\r\n    longer guarantee the life of Comrade Wels. The _Vollzugsrat_\r\n    approves.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Vollzugsrat_ itself presented a question. It asked:\r\n\r\n    \"Are the People's Commissioners prepared to protect public order\r\n    and safety, and also and especially private and public property,\r\n    against forcible attacks? Are they also prepared to use the\r\n    powers at their disposal to prevent themselves and their organs\r\n    from being interfered with in their conduct of public affairs by\r\n    acts of violence, irrespective of whence these may come?\"\r\n\r\nThe Independents, for whom Dittmann spoke, hereupon declared that they\r\nretired from the government. Thus they avoided the necessity of\r\nanswering the _Vollzugsrat's_ question. In a subsequent statement\r\npublished in their press the trio declared that the Majority members\r\nwere encouraging counter-revolution by refusing to check the power of\r\nthe military. They themselves, they asserted, were a short while earlier\r\nin a position to take over the government alone, but they could not do\r\nso since their principles did not permit them to work with a Majority\r\nSocialist _Vollzugsrat_. What they meant by saying that they could have\r\nassumed complete control of the cabinet was not explained, and it was\r\nprobably an over-optimistic statement. There is no reason to believe\r\nthat the Independents had up to this time been in a position enabling\r\nthem to throw the Majority Socialists out of the cabinet.\r\n\r\nEbert, Scheidemann and Landsberg, in a manifesto to the people, declared\r\nthat the Independents had, by their resignations, refused to take a\r\nstand in favor of assuring the safety of the state. The manifesto said:\r\n\r\n    \"By rejecting the means of assuring the state's safety, the\r\n    Independents have demonstrated their incapacity to govern. For\r\n    us the revolution is not a party watchword, but the most\r\n    valuable possession of the whole wealth-producing folk.\r\n\r\n    \"We take over their tasks as people's commissioners with the\r\n    oath: All for the revolution, all through the revolution. But we\r\n    take them over at the same time with the firm purpose to oppose\r\n    immovably all who would convert the revolution of the people\r\n    into terror by a minority.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Vollzugsrat_ elected to fill the three vacancies: Gustav Noske,\r\nstill governor of Kiel: Herr Wissell, a member of the old Reichstag, and\r\nHerr Loebe, editor of the Socialist _Volkswacht_ of Breslau. Loebe,\r\nhowever, never assumed office, and the cabinet consisted of five members\r\nuntil it was abolished by act of the National Assembly in February.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists staged a big demonstration on Sunday, December\r\n29th, in favor of the new government. Thousands of the _bourgeoisie_\r\njoined in a great parade, which ended with a tremendous assembly in\r\nfront of the government offices in the Wilhelmstrasse. The size and\r\ncharacter of the demonstration showed that the great majority of\r\nBerlin's law-abiding residents were on the side of Ebert and his\r\ncolleagues.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists did not take over the sole responsibility for\r\nthe government with a light heart. They had begun to realize something\r\nof the character of the forces working against them and were saddened\r\nbecause they had been compelled to abandon party traditions by relying\r\nupon armed force. Yet there was clearly no way of avoiding it. The\r\nSpartacans were organizing their cohorts in Bremen, Hamburg, Kiel and\r\nother cities, and had already seized the government of Duesseldorf, where\r\nthey had dissolved the city council and arrested Mayor Oehler. The\r\nSoviets of Solingen and Remscheid had accepted the Spartacan program by\r\na heavy majority. The state government of Brunswick had adopted\r\nresolutions declaring that the National Assembly could not be permitted\r\nto meet. At a meeting of the Munich Communists Emil Muehsam[59] had been\r\ngreeted with applause when he declared that the summons for the assembly\r\nwas \"the common battle-cry of reaction.\" Resolutions were passed\r\nfavoring the nullification of all war-loans.[60]\r\n\r\n[59] Muehsam was one of the characteristic types of Bolsheviki.\r\n    For years he had been an unwashed, unshorn and unshaven\r\n    literary loafer in Berlin cafes, whose chief ability\r\n    consisted in securing a following of naive persons willing to\r\n    buy drinks for him.\r\n\r\n[60] The left wing of the Independent Socialist Party already\r\n    demanded nullification, and the whole party drifted so\r\n    rapidly leftward that a platform adopted by it in the first\r\n    week of the following March definitely demanded nullification.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans (on December 30th) had reorganized as the \"Communist\r\nLaborers' Party of Germany--Spartacus League.\" Radek-Sobelsohn, who had\r\nfor some weeks been carrying on his Bolshevik propaganda from various\r\nhiding places, attended the meeting and made a speech in which he\r\ndeclared that the Spartacans must not let themselves be frightened by\r\nthe fear of civil war. Rosa Luxemburg openly summoned her hearers to\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the national government was small in any event, and was\r\nopenly flouted and opposed in some places. Sailors and marines had\r\norganized the Republic of Oldenburg-East Frisia and elected an\r\nunlettered sailor named Bernhard Kuhnt as president. The president of\r\nthe Republic of Brunswick was a bushelman tailor named Leo Merges, and\r\nthe minister of education was a woman who had been a charwoman and had\r\nbeen discharged by a woman's club for which she had worked for petty\r\npeculations. Kurt Eisner, minister-president of Bavaria, was a dreamy,\r\nlong-haired Communist writer who had earlier had to leave the editorial\r\nstaff of _Vorwaerts_ because of an utter lack of practical common-sense.\r\nHe was a fair poet and an excellent feuilletonist, but quite unfitted to\r\nparticipate in governmental affairs. His opposition to the national\r\ngovernment severely handicapped it, and the Bavarian state government\r\nwas at the same time crippled by the natural antagonism of a\r\npredominantly Catholic people to a Jewish president.\r\n\r\nTo the south the Czechs had occupied Bodenbach and Tetschen in German\r\nBohemia, and were threatening the border. To the east the Poles,\r\nunwilling to await the awards of the peace conference, had seized the\r\ncity of Posen, were taxing the German residents there for the\r\nmaintenance of an army to be used against their own government, and had\r\ngiven notice that a war loan was to be issued. Paderewski, head of the\r\nnew Polish Government, had been permitted to land at Danzig on the\r\npromise that he would proceed directly to Warsaw. Instead, he went to\r\nPosen and made inflammatory speeches against the Germans until the\r\nEnglish officer accompanying him was directed by the British Government\r\nto see that the terms of the promise to the German government were\r\nobeyed. The German Government, endeavoring to assemble and transport\r\nsufficient forces to repel Polish aggressions against German territory,\r\nfound opposition among the Spartacans and Independent Socialists at\r\nhome, and from the Bolshevik Brunswick authorities, who announced that\r\nno government troops would be permitted to pass through the state, or to\r\nbe recruited there. Government troops entering Brunswick were disarmed.\r\nThe state government gave the Berlin cabinet notice that decrees of the\r\nMinister of War had no validity in Brunswick. General Scheuch, the\r\nMinister of War, resigned in disgust.\r\n\r\nWhat later became an epidemic of strikes began. Seventy thousand workers\r\nwere idle in Berlin. Upper Silesia reported serious labor troubles\r\nthroughout the mining districts, due to Russian and German Bolshevist\r\nagitators and Poles.\r\n\r\nA less happy New Year for men responsible for the affairs of a great\r\nstate was doubtless never recorded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n                   Liebknecht Tries to Overthrow the\r\n                  Government; Is Arrested and Killed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the six weeks that Emil Eichhorn had been Police-President of Berlin\r\nthe situation in his department had become a public scandal. The arming\r\nof the criminal and hooligan classes by this guardian of public safety,\r\nwhich had at first been carried on quietly, was now being done openly\r\nand shamelessly, and had reached great proportions. Liebknecht and\r\nLedebour, Spartacan and Independent, were in constant and close\r\nfellowship with him. A considerable part of the Republican Soldier Guard\r\nhad been turned from allegiance to the government that had appointed\r\nthem and could be reckoned as adherents of Eichhorn. The Berlin police\r\ndepartment had become an _imperium in imperio_.\r\n\r\nThe _Vollzugsrat_ conducted a formal investigation of Eichhorn's\r\nofficial acts. The investigation, which was conducted honestly and with\r\ndignity, convicted the Police-President of gross inefficiency,\r\ninsubordination, diversion and conversion of public funds, and conduct\r\ndesigned to weaken and eventually overthrow the government. _Vorwaerts_\r\nwas able to disclose the further fact that Eichhorn had throughout his\r\nterm of office been drawing a salary of 1,800 marks monthly from\r\nLenine's _Rosta_, the Bolshevik propaganda-central for Germany. The\r\n_Vollzugsrat_ removed Eichhorn from office.\r\n\r\nEichhorn, relying on the armed forces at his disposal and doubtless\r\nequally on the probability that a Socialist government would not dare\r\nuse actual force against _Genossen_, refused to comply with the order\r\nfor his removal. The more ignorant of his followers--and this embraced a\r\ngreat proportion--saw in the _Vollzugsrat's_ action the first move in\r\nthat counter-revolution whose specter had so artfully been kept before\r\ntheir eyes by their leaders.\r\n\r\nIt is a current saying in England that when an Englishman has a\r\ngrievance, he writes to the _Times_ about it. When a German has a\r\ngrievance, he organizes a parade and marches through the city carrying\r\nbanners and transparencies, and shouting _hoch_! (hurrah!) for his\r\nfriends and _nieder_! (down) with his enemies. On Sunday, January 5th, a\r\ngreat demonstration was staged as a protest against Eichhorn's removal.\r\nIt is significant that, although Eichhorn was an Independent Socialist,\r\nthe moving spirit and chief orator of the day was the Spartacan\r\nLiebknecht. This, too, despite the fact that at the convention where the\r\nSpartacus League had been reorganized a week earlier, the Independents\r\nhad been roundly denounced as timorous individuals and enemies of\r\nSimon-Pure Socialism. Similar denunciations of the Spartacans had come\r\nfrom the Independents. The psychology of it all is puzzling, and the\r\nauthor contents himself with recording the facts without attempting to\r\nexplain them.\r\n\r\nSunday's parade was of imposing proportions, and it was marked by a grim\r\nearnestness that foreboded trouble. The organizers claimed that 150,000\r\npersons were in the line of march. The real number was probably around\r\ntwenty thousand. Transparencies bore defiant inscriptions. \"Down with\r\nEbert and Scheidemann, the Bloodhounds and Grave-diggers of the\r\nRevolution!\" was a favorite device. \"Down with the Bloodhound Wels!\" was\r\nanother. Cheers for \"our Police-President\" and groans for the cabinet\r\nwere continuous along the line of march. The great mass of the paraders\r\nwere ragged, underfed, miserable men and women, mute testimony to the\r\nsufferings of the war-years.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht addressed the paraders. Counter-revolution, he declared, was\r\nalready showing its head. The Ebert-Scheidemann government must be\r\noverthrown and the real friends of the revolution must not shrink from\r\nusing violence if violence were necessary. Others spoke in a similar\r\nvein.\r\n\r\nConditions appeared propitious for the _coup_ that had been preparing\r\nfor a month. Late Sunday evening armed Spartacans occupied the plants of\r\nthe _Vorwaerts_, _Tageblatt_, the Ullstein Company (publishers of _Die\r\nMorgenpost_ and _Berliner Zeitung-am-Mittag_), the _Lokal-Anzeiger_ and\r\nthe Wolff Bureau.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans in the _Vorwaerts_ plant published on Monday morning _Der\r\nrote Vorwaerts_ (the Red _Vorwaerts_). It contained a boastful leading\r\nArticle announcing that the paper had been taken over by \"real\r\nrevolutionists,\" and that \"no power on earth shall take it from us.\" The\r\nLiebknechtians also seized on Monday the Buexenstein plant, where the\r\n_Kreuz-Zeitung_ is printed. There was much promiscuous shooting in\r\nvarious parts of the city. Spartacans fired on unarmed government\r\nsupporters in front of the war ministry, killing one man and wounding\r\ntwo. There were also bloody clashes at Wilhelm Platz, Potsdamer Platz\r\nand in Unter den Linden.\r\n\r\nThe _Vollzugsrat_ rose to the occasion like a _bourgeois_ governing\r\nbody. It conferred extraordinary powers on the cabinet and authorized it\r\nto use all force at its disposal to put down the Bolshevist uprising.\r\nThat it was Bolshevist was now apparent to everybody. The cabinet, still\r\nhesitant about firing on _Genossen_, conferred with the Independents\r\nHaase, Dittmann, Cohn and Dr. Rudolf Breitscheid, the last named one of\r\nthe so-called \"intellectual leaders\" of the Independent Socialists.\r\nThese men wanted the government to \"compromise.\" The cabinet declared it\r\ncould listen to no proposals until the occupied newspaper plants should\r\nhave been restored to their rightful owners. The delegation withdrew to\r\nconfer with the Spartacan leaders. These refused flatly to surrender\r\ntheir usurped strongholds.\r\n\r\nSeveral lively street battles marked the course of Tuesday, January 7th.\r\nThe Spartacans succeeded in driving the government troops from the\r\nBrandenburger Tor, but after a short time were in turn driven out.\r\nSpartacan and Independent Socialist parades filled the streets of the\r\nold city. The government did nothing to stop these demonstrations. Haase\r\nand the other members of Monday's delegation spent most of the day\r\ntrying to induce the government to compromise. Their ingenious idea of a\r\n\"compromise\" was for the entire cabinet to resign and be replaced by a\r\n\"parity\" government made up of two Majority Socialists, two Independents\r\nand two Spartacans. This, of course, would have meant in effect a\r\ngovernment of four Bolsheviki and two Majority Socialists. Despite their\r\ntraditions of and training in party \"solidarity,\" the cabinet could not\r\nhelp seeing that the \"compromise\" proposed would mean handing the\r\ngovernment over bodily to Liebknecht, for Haase and Dittmann had long\r\nlost all power to lead their former followers back into democratic\r\npaths. The bulk of the party was already irrevocably committed to\r\npractical Bolshevism. The scholarly Eduard Bernstein, who had followed\r\nHaase and the other seceders from the Majority Socialists in 1916, had\r\nannounced his return to the parent party. In a long explanation of the\r\nreasons for his course he denounced the Independents as lacking any\r\nconstructive program and with having departed from their real mission.\r\nThey had become, he declared, a party committed to tearing down existing\r\ninstitutions. Other adherents of the party's right wing refused to have\r\nanything to do with the new course.\r\n\r\nThe night of January 7th was marked by hard fighting. Spartacans\r\nrepeatedly attacked government troops at the Anhalt Railway Station in\r\nthe Koeniggraetzerstrasse, but were repulsed with heavy losses. They also\r\nattacked the government troops defending the Potsdam Railway Station, a\r\nquarter of a mile north from the Anhalt Station, but were also repulsed\r\nthere. Government soldiers, however, had considerable losses in an\r\nunsuccessful attempt to retake the Wolff Bureau building at\r\nCharlottenstrasse and Zimmerstrasse. On Wednesday, the section of the\r\ncity around the Brandenburger Tor was again filled with parading\r\nBolsheviki, but the government had plucked up enough courage and\r\ndecision to decree that no parades should be permitted to enter\r\nWilhelmstrasse, where the seat of government is situated. Spartacans\r\nattempted to invade this street in the afternoon, but scattered when\r\ngovernment soldiers fired a few shots, although the soldiers fired into\r\nthe air. The Independent go-betweens again assailed the cabinet in an\r\neffort to secure the \"compromise\" government suggested the day before.\r\nThe delegation was hampered, however, both by the fact that the cabinet\r\nrealized what such a compromise would mean and by the fact that the\r\nIndependents could promise nothing. The Spartacans stubbornly refused to\r\nsurrender the captured newspaper plants, and the Independents themselves\r\nwere committed to the retention in office of Eichhorn.\r\n\r\nEichhorn, still at his desk in Police Headquarters, refused even to\r\nadmit to the building Police-President Richter of Charlottenburg, who\r\nhad been named as his successor, and he and his aides were still busily\r\narming deluded workingmen and young hooligans of sixteen and seventeen,\r\nas well as some women. The People's Marine Division announced that it\r\nsided with the government, but it played little part in its defense.\r\n\r\nThe rattle of machine-guns and the crack of rifles kept Berliners awake\r\nnearly all night. The hardest fighting was at the _Tageblatt_ plant, in\r\nfront of the Foreign Office and the Chancellor's Palace, and around the\r\nBrandenburger Tor. Thursday morning found the government decided to put\r\nan end to the unbearable conditions. It was announced that no parades\r\nwould be tolerated and that government soldiers had been ordered to\r\nshoot to kill if any such aggregations disobeyed orders to disperse.\r\nSpartacus, realizing that the government meant what it said, called no\r\nmeetings, and the streets were free of howling demonstrants for the\r\nfirst time since Sunday.\r\n\r\nThe government further addressed a proclamation to the people,\r\naddressing them this time as _Mitbuerger_ (fellow-citizens), instead of\r\n_Genossen_. It announced that negotiations had been broken off with the\r\nrebels, and assailed the dishonest and dishonorable tactics of the\r\nIndependent Socialists represented by the Haase-Dittmann delegation.\r\n_Die Freiheit_ and _Der rote Vorwaerts_ assailed the government; still\r\nthe proclamation had a good effect and decent elements generally rallied\r\nto the government's support. The day's fighting was confined to the\r\n_Tageblatt_ plant, where three hundred Bolsheviki were entrenched to\r\ndefend the liberty of other people's property. The place could have been\r\ntaken with artillery, but it was desired to spare the building if\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nFriday passed with only scattered sniping. The Spartacans and their\r\nIndependent helpers grew boastful. They had not yet learned to know what\r\nmanner of man Gustav Noske, the new cabinet member, was. They made his\r\nacquaintance early Saturday morning. Before the sun had risen government\r\ntroops had posted themselves with artillery and mine-throwers a few\r\nhundred yards from the _Vorwaerts_ plant. The battle was short and\r\ndecisive. A single mine swept out of existence the Spartacans' barricade\r\nin front of the building, and a few more shots made the building ripe\r\nfor storm. The government troops lost only two or three men, but more\r\nthan a score of Bolsheviki were killed and more than a hundred,\r\nincluding some Russians and women, were captured. The _Vorwaerts_ plant\r\nwas a new building and much more valuable than some of the other plants\r\noccupied by the Spartacans, but it was selected for bombardment because\r\nthe cabinet members wished to show, by sacrificing their own party's\r\nproperty first, that they were not playing favorites.\r\n\r\nThe fall of the _Vorwaerts_ stronghold and the firm stand of the\r\ngovernment disheartened the mercenary and criminal recruits of the\r\nSpartacans. Police Headquarters, the real center of the revolutionary\r\nmovement, was taken early Sunday morning after a few 10.5-centimeter\r\nshells had been fired into it. The official report told of twelve\r\nSpartacans killed, but their casualties were actually much higher.\r\nEichhorn had chosen the better part of valor and disappeared. The\r\nBolsheviki occupying the various newspaper plants began deserting _en\r\nmasse_ over neighboring roofs and the plants were occupied by government\r\ntroops without a contest. News came that Liebknecht's followers had also\r\nabandoned the Boetzow Brewery in the eastern part of the city, one of\r\ntheir main strongholds. Late in the afternoon they also fled from the\r\nSilesian Railway Station, where they had been storing up stolen\r\nprovisions, assembling arms and ammunition and preparing to make a last\r\ndesperate stand.\r\n\r\nThe government, averse though it was to the employment of force to\r\nmaintain its authority, had realized at the beginning of December the\r\nincreasing strength of the Spartacans, and had begun assembling a\r\nmilitary force of loyal soldiers in various garrisons outside the city.\r\nThree thousand of these troops now marched into the city. Hundreds of\r\nthe men in the ranks carried rifles slung across officers'\r\nshoulder-straps. They marched as troops ought to march, sang patriotic\r\nsongs and looked grimly determined. For miles along their route they\r\nwere greeted by frantic cheering and even by joyous tears from the\r\nlaw-abiding citizens who had been terrorized by the scum of a great\r\ncapital.[61]\r\n\r\n[61] The task of the government was made harder throughout its\r\n    darkest days by the aid and comfort given its enemies by the\r\n    character of the reports published in certain enemy papers\r\n    regarding conditions in Germany. Nearly the entire Paris\r\n    press regularly published extravagantly untrue reports\r\n    concerning the situation, and many English and American\r\n    papers followed suit. The London _Times_ of December 10th\r\n    gravely told its readers that \"in a political sense Ebert is\r\n    suspected of being a mere tool of the old regime, whose\r\n    difficult task it is to pave the first stages of the road to\r\n    the restoration of the Hohenzollerns months or years hence.\"\r\n    Three days later it declared that \"the German army chiefs\r\n    propose to let the Spartacans upset the government so that\r\n    they can summon Hindenburg to save the day and reestablish\r\n    the monarchy.\"Articles of this stamp were eagerly pounced\r\n    upon and republished by Independent Socialist and Spartacan\r\n    organs of the stamp of _Die Freiheit_, _Die Republik_,\r\n    Liebknecht's _Die rote Fahne_, and others, and were of great\r\n    assistance to the enemies of good government in their efforts\r\n    to convince the ignorant and fanatical that the government\r\n    was organizing a \"white guard\" for counter-revolutionary\r\n    purposes and was plotting the restoration of the monarchy.\r\n    One dispatch from Paris, published extensively in the\r\n    American press on February 26th, quoted in all seriousness \"a\r\n    prominent American Socialist in close touch with German\r\n    Liberals and with exceptional sources of secret information,\"\r\n    who had learned that \"the German revolution was a piece of\r\n    theatrical manipulation by agents of the militaristic\r\n    oligarchy to win an armistice.\" That such a report could be\r\n    published in responsible organs is a staggering commentary on\r\n    the manner in which the war-psychosis inhibited clear\r\n    thinking. The Conservative Deputy Hergt, speaking in the\r\n    Prussian Diet on March 15th, said: \"We Conservatives are not\r\n    conscienceless enough to plunge the land into civil warfare.\r\n    We shall wait patiently until the sound sense of the German\r\n    people shall demand a return to the monarchic form of\r\n    government.\" American papers carried the following report of\r\n    this statement: \"Speaking before the new Prussian Diet in\r\n    Berlin, Deputy Hergt proposed that Prussia should restore the\r\n    monarchy.\" Volumes could be written about these false reports\r\n    alone.\r\n\r\nThe week of terror had practically ended. There was still some\r\nsniping from housetops and some looting, but organized resistance had\r\nbeen crushed. Liebknecht and Rosa Luxemburg had gone into hiding.\r\nLiebknecht's seventeen-year-old son and sister had been arrested.\r\nLedebour, more courageous or, perhaps, more confident that a veteran\r\n_Genosse_ had nothing to fear from a Socialist government, remained\r\nand was arrested.\r\n\r\nIt had been no part of the cabinet's plan or desire to have their\r\nveteran colleague of former days arrested. On January 12th the writer,\r\nspeaking with one of the most prominent Majority Socialist leaders,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n    \"You can now hardly avoid having Ledebour locked up.\"\r\n\r\nThe man addressed shrugged his shoulders reflectively and answered:\r\n\r\n    \"Well, you see, Herr Kollege, we can't very well do so. Ledebour\r\n    is an old comrade, he was for many years one of the party's\r\n    secretaries and has done great services for the party.\"\r\n\r\n\"But he has taken part in an armed uprising to overthrow the government\r\nand to destroy that same party,\" persisted the writer. The Socialist\r\nleader admitted it.\r\n\r\n\"But he is acting from ideal motives,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThis refusal to judge opponents by their acts instead of by their\r\nmotives hampered the government throughout its career. It is less\r\nspecifically Socialistic than German, and is the outgrowth of what is\r\ntermed _Rechthaberei_ in German an untranslatable word exactly\r\nillustrated by the colloquy reported above. It is not the least among\r\nthe mental traits that make it impossible for the average German ever to\r\nbecome what is popularly known as a practical politician; a trait that\r\nkept the German people in their condition of political immaturity.\r\n\r\nIn Ledebour's case, however, the government found itself compelled to\r\nact drastically. A proclamation was found which declared the government\r\ndeposed and taken over temporarily by the three men who signed it. These\r\nwere Liebknecht, Ledebour and another Independent Socialist named\r\nScholtze. In the first days of the uprising they had sent a detachment\r\nof Spartacans to the War Ministry to present the proclamation and take\r\ncharge of that department's affairs, and only the presence of mind and\r\ncourage of a young officer had prevented the scheme from succeeding. In\r\nthe face of this, no government that demanded respect for its authority\r\ncould permit Ledebour to remain at liberty. His arrest was nevertheless\r\nthe signal for some adverse criticism even from Majority Socialists\r\nwhose class-conscious solidarity was greater than their intelligence.\r\n\r\nLiebknecht was still in hiding, but it was less easy to hide in\r\nBerlin than it had been a month earlier, for the old criminal police\r\nwere at work again. The experiment with soldier-policemen had\r\nresulted so disastrously that every Berliner who had anything to lose\r\nwelcomed the return of these men who had been so denounced and hated\r\nin other days. The search lasted but two days. On January 15th\r\nLiebknecht's apartment was searched, and great amounts of propagandist\r\npamphlets and correspondence showing him to be in constant touch with\r\nthe Russian Soviet Government were found. On the evening of the next day\r\npolicemen and soldiers surrounded the house of a distant relative of\r\nLiebknecht's wife in the western part of the city and Liebknecht was\r\nfound. He denied his identity at first, but finally admitted that he was\r\nthe man wanted.\r\n\r\nHe was taken to the Eden Hotel in Charlottenburg, which had been\r\noccupied in part by the staff of the government troops. Rosa Luxemburg,\r\nfound hiding in another house, was brought to the hotel at the same\r\ntime. After the two had been questioned, preparations were made to take\r\nthem to the city prison in Moabit.\r\n\r\nDespite all precautions, news of the arrests had transpired, and the\r\nhotel was surrounded by a vast crowd, mainly made up of better class\r\ncitizens, since the district where the hotel is situated is one of the\r\nbest residential districts of Greater Berlin. The feeling of these\r\npeople against the two persons who were in so great measure responsible\r\nfor the terrors of the week just past naturally ran high. The appearance\r\nof the soldiers guarding the two was the signal for a wild rush. The\r\nLuxemburg woman was struck repeatedly and Liebknecht received a blow on\r\nthe head which caused a bloody wound.\r\n\r\nNeither the man nor woman ever reached prison. Soldiers brought to the\r\nmorgue late that night the body of \"an unidentified man,\" alleged to\r\nhave been shot while running away from his guards. One bullet had struck\r\nhim between the shoulders and another in the middle of the back of the\r\nneck. The woman disappeared utterly.\r\n\r\nOn the following day (January 16th) it became known that both Liebknecht\r\nand Luxemburg had been killed. Exactly who fired the fatal shots was\r\nnever clearly established, but an investigation did establish that the\r\nofficers in charge of the men guarding the two prisoners were guilty of\r\na negligence which was undoubtedly deliberate, and intended to make the\r\nkillings possible.\r\n\r\nThe impression was profound. The _Deutsche Tageszeitung_, while\r\ndeploring lynch law and summary justice, declared that the deaths of the\r\ntwo agitators must be regarded as \"almost a Divine judgment.\" This was\r\nthe tenor of all _bourgeois_ comment, and even _Vorwaerts_ admitted that\r\nthe dead man and woman had fallen as victims of the base passions which\r\nthey themselves had aroused. They had summoned up spirits which they\r\ncould not exorcise. There was nevertheless much apprehension regarding\r\nthe form which the vengeance of the victims' followers might take, but\r\nthis confined itself in the main to verbal attacks on the _bourgeoisie_\r\nand Majority Socialists, and denunciation of Noske's \"White Guard,\" as\r\nthe loyal soldiers who protected the law-abiding part of the population\r\nwere termed. Disorders were feared on the day of Liebknecht's funeral,\r\nbut none came.\r\n\r\nThe government gained a much needed breathing spell through these\r\nevents. With Liebknecht and Luxemburg dead, Radek in hiding, Ledebour\r\nlocked up and Eichhorn--as it transpired later--fled to Brunswick, the\r\nSpartacans, deprived of their most energetic leaders and shaken by their\r\nbloody losses of Bolshevik week, could not so quickly rally their forces\r\nfor another _coup_. Their losses are not definitely known, but they were\r\nestimated at approximately two hundred dead and nearly a thousand\r\nwounded. The losses of the government troops were negligible.\r\n\r\nNoske, who had taken over from Ebert the administration of military\r\naffairs, announced that there would be no further temporizing with\r\npersons endeavoring to overthrow the government by force. He issued a\r\ndecree setting forth the duty of the soldiers to preserve order, protect\r\nproperty and defend themselves in all circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe decree said further:\r\n\r\n    \"No soldier can be excused for failure to perform his duty if he\r\n    have not, in the cases specified above, made timely and adequate\r\n    use of his weapons to attain the purpose set forth.\"\r\n\r\nSome six years earlier Police-President von Jagow had brought a flood of\r\nSocialist abuse on his head because, in a general order to the police,\r\nhe referred to the fact that there had been an unusual number of escapes\r\nof criminals and attacks on policemen and added: \"Henceforth I shall\r\npunish any policeman who in such case has failed to make timely use of\r\nhis weapons.\" And now a Socialist issued an order of much the same\r\ntenor. The _Genossen_ had learned by bitter experience that there is a\r\ndifference between criticizing and governing, and that moral suasion\r\noccasionally fails with the lowest elements of a great city.\r\n\r\nDefeated in Berlin, the Bolsheviki turned their attention to the coast\r\ncities. The \"Republic of Cuxhaven\" was proclaimed, with a school-teacher\r\nas president. It collapsed in five days as a result of the government's\r\ndecisive action. An attempted _coup_ in Bremen also failed, but both\r\nthese uprisings left the Spartacans and Independents of these cities in\r\npossession of large supplies of arms and ammunition.\r\n\r\nJanuary 18th, the forty-seventh anniversary of the founding of the\r\nGerman Empire, brought melancholy reflections for all Germans. The\r\nBolshevist-hued Socialists were impotently raging in defeat; the\r\n_bourgeoisie_ lamented past glories; the Majority Socialists were under\r\na crossfire from both sides. The Conservative _Kreuz-Zeitung_ wrote:\r\n\r\n    \"January 18th: What feelings are awakened on this day under\r\n    prevailing conditions! In other times we celebrated today the\r\n    Empire's glory, its resurrection from impotence and dissension\r\n    to unity and strength. We believed its existence and power\r\n    assured for centuries. And today? After less than half a century\r\n    the old misery has come upon us and has cast us down lower than\r\n    ever. This time, too, Germany could be conquered only because it\r\n    was disunited. In the last analysis it was from the\r\n    Social-Democratic poison of Internationalism and negation of\r\n    state that the Empire became infected and defenseless. How\r\n    painfully wrong were those who, in smiling optimism, ever made\r\n    light of all warnings against the Social-Democratic danger. It\r\n    will be our real danger in the future also. If we do not\r\n    overcome the Social-Democratic spirit among our people we cannot\r\n    recover our health.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Kreuz-Zeitung's_ diagnosis was correct, but it had required a\r\nnational post-mortem to establish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n                           The National Assembly.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn preparation for the National Assembly, the various existing\r\npolitical parties effected generally a sweeping reorganization, which\r\nincluded, for the most part, changes of designations as well. The\r\nConservatives and Free Conservatives coalesced as The German National\r\nPeople's Party (_Deutsch-nationale Volkspartei_). The right wing of\r\nthe National-Liberals, under the leadership of Dr. Stresemann, became\r\nthe German People's Party (_Deutsche Volkspartei_). The left wing of the\r\nold party, under the leadership of Baron von Richthofen joined with the\r\nformer Progressives (_Fortschrittliche Volkspartei_) to form the German\r\nDemocratic Party (_Deutsch-demokratische Partei_). The Clericals\r\nretained their party solidarity but christened themselves German\r\nChristian Party (_Deutsch-Christliche Partei_). The Majority and\r\nIndependent Socialists retained their old organizations and party\r\ndesignations. The Spartacans, as outspoken enemies of any national\r\nassembly, could not consistently have anything to do with it and placed\r\nno ticket in the field. Most of the Independent Socialists were also\r\nopponents of a constituent assembly, but the party organization was\r\nstill trying to blow both hot and cold and had not yet gone on record\r\nofficially as favoring a soviet government and the dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat.\r\n\r\nOf the parties as reorganized, the National People's and the People's\r\nparties were monarchic. The Christian Party (Clericals) contained many\r\nmen who believed a limited monarchy to be the best form of government\r\nfor Germany, but as a whole the party was democratically inclined and\r\nout of sympathy with any attempt at that time to restore the monarchy.\r\nThe two Socialist parties were, of course, advocates of a republic and\r\nbitter opponents of monarchs and monarchies.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic Party came into existence mainly through the efforts of\r\nTheodor Wolff, the brilliant editor of the Berlin _Tageblatt_. No other\r\nnon-Socialist editor realized so early or so completely as Wolff whither\r\nthe policy of the old government was taking Germany. He had opposed the\r\nsubmarine warfare, condemned the treaty of Brest-Litovsk, attacked the\r\nmethods and influence of the pan-Germans and constantly advocated\r\ndrastic democratic reforms. Probably no other _bourgeois_ newspaper had\r\nbeen so often suppressed as the _Tageblatt_, and it shared with\r\nSocialist organs the distinction of being prohibited in many army units\r\nand in some military departments at home. Although Wolff held no\r\npolitical office, his influence in the Progressive Party and with the\r\nleft wing of the National-Liberals was great, and even many Socialists\r\nregularly read his leading articles, which were more often cabled to\r\nAmerica than were the editorials of any other German publicist, not\r\nexcepting even the _poseur_ Maximilian Harden-Witkowski.\r\n\r\nThe revolution was hardly an accomplished fact before Wolff saw the\r\nnecessity for a democratic, non-Socialist political party which must be\r\nfree of elements compromised in any manner by participation in the old\r\ngovernment or by support of its militaristic and imperialistic policies.\r\nHe took it upon himself to issue the summons for the formation of such a\r\nparty. The response was immediate and gratifying. Help came even from\r\nunexpected quarters. Prince Lichnowsky, former Ambassador to Great\r\nBritain; Count Brockdorff-Rantzau, who had succeeded Dr. Solf as Foreign\r\nMinister; Baron von Richthofen of the National-Liberals, Count Johannes\r\nBernstorff, former Ambassador to the United States, and many other\r\nprominent members of the higher German nobility[62] joined with\r\n_bourgeois_ political leaders to organize the new party. Not all\r\ncompromised elements could be kept out of the party, but they were\r\nexcluded from any active participation in the conduct of its affairs or\r\nthe shaping of its policies.\r\n\r\n[62] A surprisingly large number of Americans cannot or will not\r\n    believe that a prince or a count can be a real democrat. This\r\n    is plainly due to a too prevalent confusion of the words\r\n    democratic with republican. All republics are, Footnote: in\r\n    theory at least, democratic, but a monarchist can\r\n    consistently be a democrat. The two most democratic countries\r\n    in the world are Denmark and Norway, yet both are kingdoms.\r\n    The democratic sentiments of the men named above, with the\r\n    possible exception of one, were of no recent growth; they\r\n    long antedated the revolution.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the party stood far to the left. Wolff, at the extreme\r\nleft of his organization, might be described either as a _bourgeois_\r\nSocialist or a Socialistic _bourgeois_ politician. The recruits from the\r\nformer National-Liberal Party were less radical, but even they\r\nsubscribed to a platform which called for the nationalization\r\n(socialization) of a long list of essential industries, notably mines\r\nand water and electrical power, and, in general, for sweeping economic\r\nreforms and the most direct participation of the people in the\r\ngovernment. The fact that the new party was chiefly financed by big\r\nJewish capitalists caused it to be attacked by anti-Semites and\r\nproletarians alike, but this detracted little from its strength at the\r\npolls, since Germany's anti-Semites were never found in any considerable\r\nnumbers among the _bourgeois_ parties of the Left, and the proletarians\r\nwere already for the most part adherents of one of the Socialist\r\nfactions.\r\n\r\nThe campaign for the elections to the National Assembly was conducted\r\nwith great energy and equally great bitterness by all parties. Despite\r\nan alleged shortage of paper which had for months made it impossible for\r\nthe newspapers to print more than a small part of the advertisements\r\nsubmitted to them, tons of paper were used for handbills and placards.\r\nThe streets, already filthy enough, were strewn ankle-deep in places\r\nwith appeals for this or that party and vilifications of opponents.\r\nAeroplanes dropped thousands of dodgers over the chief cities. New daily\r\npapers, most of them unlovely excrescences on the body of the press,\r\nmade their appearance and secured paper grants for their consumption.\r\n\r\nOne feature of the campaign illustrated strikingly what had already been\r\nclear to dispassionate observers: Germany's new government was\r\nunashamedly a party government first and a general government second.\r\nMajority Socialist election posters were placed in public buildings,\r\nrailway stations, etc., to the exclusion of all other parties. Its\r\nhandbills were distributed by government employees and from government\r\nautomobiles and aeroplanes. The _bourgeois Hallesche Zeitung's_ paper\r\nsupply was cut in half in order that the new Socialist _Volkszeitung_\r\nmight be established, and its protest was dismissed by the Soldiers'\r\nCouncil with the statement that the _Volkszeitung_ was \"more important.\"\r\nNot even the most reactionary of the old German governments would have\r\ndared abuse its power in this manner. It may be doubted whether the\r\nrevolutionary government was at all conscious of the impropriety of its\r\ncourse, but even if it had been it would have made no difference. One of\r\nthe great sources of strength of Socialism is its conviction that all\r\nmeans are sacred for the furtherance of the class struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans had boasted that the elections would not be permitted to\r\nbe held, but the decided attitude of the government made their boast an\r\nempty one. Soldiers in steel helmets, their belts filled with\r\nhand-grenades and carrying rifles with fixed bayonets, guarded the\r\npolling places whereever trouble was expected. In Harburg the\r\nballot-boxes were burned, and reports of disorders came from two or\r\nthree small districts elsewhere, but the election as a whole was quietly\r\nand honestly conducted. Election day in Manhattan has often seen more\r\ndisorders than were reported from all Germany on January 19th.\r\n\r\nThe result of the election contained no surprises; it was, in general,\r\npractically what had been forecast by the best observers. The Majority\r\nSocialists, who had hoped for an absolute majority but had not expected\r\nit, polled about 43 per cent of the total popular vote and secured 163\r\ndelegates to the National Convention. This was an increase of nearly 8\r\nper cent since the last general election of 1912. The Independent\r\nSocialists demonstrated considerable strength in Greater Berlin, but\r\nonly one in every twenty-five of the whole country's voters supported\r\nthem and only twenty-two of their followers were elected. Kurt Eisner,\r\nMinister-President of Bavaria, failed of election although his name was\r\non the ticket in more than twenty election districts.\r\n\r\nThe total membership of the National Convention was to have been 433\r\ndelegates, but the French authorities in charge of the troops occupying\r\nAlsace-Lorraine refused to permit elections to be held there, which\r\nreduced the assembly's membership to 421. A majority was thus 211, and\r\nthe two Socialist parties, with a combined total of 185, could\r\naccomplish nothing without 26 additional votes from some _bourgeois_\r\nparty. As it later developed, moreover, the government party could count\r\non the support of the Independents only in matters where Socialist\r\nsolidarity was sentimentally involved; on matters affecting economic\r\npolicies there was much more kinship between the Majority Socialists and\r\nthe Democrats than between them and the followers of Haase.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats, with 75 delegates, were the second strongest\r\nnon-Socialist party, the former Clericals having 88. By virtue of their\r\nposition midway between Right and Left they held the real balance of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nThe National People's Party, the former Conservatives and Free\r\nConservatives, made a surprisingly good showing in the elections,\r\nsecuring 42 delegates. This number, however, included the delegates of\r\nthe Middle and the National-Liberal parties of Bavaria and the Citizens'\r\nParty and Peasants' and Vineyardists' League of Wuerttemberg. The remnant\r\nof the old National-Liberal Party was able to elect only 21 delegates.\r\n\r\nThere were, in addition to the parties enumerated, the Bavarian\r\nPeasants' League with 4 delegates, the Schleswig-Holstein Peasants' and\r\nFarm-Laborers' Democratic League with 1 delegate, the Brunswick State\r\nElection Association with 1 and the German-Hanoverian Party (Guelphs)\r\nwith 4 delegates. Not even the urgent need of uniting dissevered\r\nelements so far as possible could conquer the old German tendency to\r\ncarry metaphysical hairsplitting into politics. The German Reichstags\r\nregularly had from twelve to sixteen different parties, and even then\r\nthere were generally two or three delegates who found themselves unable\r\nto agree with the tenets of any one of these parties and remained\r\nunattached, the \"wild delegates\" (_die Wilden_), as they were termed.\r\nThere were ten parties in the National Assembly, and one of these, as\r\nhas been said, was a combination of five parties.\r\n\r\nDemocracy had an overwhelming majority in the assembly. The Majority\r\nSocialists and Democrats together had a clear joint majority of 27\r\nvotes, and the Clericals' strength included many democratic delegates.\r\nNo fewer than eight of the party's delegates were secretaries of labor\r\nunions. Thirty-four women, the greatest number ever chosen to any\r\ncountry's parliament, were elected as delegates. The Majority\r\nSocialists, the original advocates of woman's suffrage in Germany,\r\nfittingly elected the greatest number of these--15; the Clericals were\r\nnext with 7, the Democrats elected 5, the Conservatives 4, and the\r\nIndependent Socialists 3.\r\n\r\nThe government announced that the National Assembly would be held in\r\nWeimar on February 6th. Hardly a fortnight had passed since the first\r\n\"Bolshevik week,\" and the cabinet feared disorders, if nothing worse, if\r\nan attempt were made to hold the assembly in Berlin. It was also easier\r\nto afford adequate protection in a city of thirty-five thousand than in\r\nthe capital. Although it was never declared in so many words, it is\r\nprobable that a sentimental reason also played a part in the choice.\r\nThere was no taint of Prussianism about Weimar. As the \"intellectual\r\ncapital of Germany\" it has an aura possessed by no other German city.\r\nGoethe, Schiller and Herder spent the greater part of their lives in\r\nthis little Thuringian city and are buried there. It has given shelter\r\nto many other men whose names are revered by educated people the world\r\nover. It is reminiscent of days when militarism and imperialism had not\r\nyet corrupted a \"people of thinkers and dreamers,\" of days when culture\r\nhad not yet given way to _Kultur_, of days before a simple, industrious\r\npeople had been converted to a belief in their mission to impose the\r\nideals of _Preussen-Deutschland_ upon the world with \"the mailed fist\"\r\nand \"in shining armor.\" It is characteristic that men in high places\r\nbelieved--and they undoubtedly did believe--that a recollection of these\r\nthings could in some way redound to the benefit of Germany.\r\n\r\nThe days between the elections and the convening of the National\r\nAssembly brought further serious complications in Germany's domestic\r\nsituation. Disaffection among the soldiers was increased by an order of\r\nColonel Reinhardt, the new Minister of War, defining the respective\r\npowers of officers' and the soldiers' councils. The order declared that\r\nthe power of command remained with the officers in all matters affecting\r\ntactics and strategy. The councils' functions were confined to matters\r\nof provisioning and to disciplinary punishments. This order, although in\r\naccordance with the original decree of the cabinet regarding the matter,\r\nfailed to satisfy men who had become contemptuous of all authority\r\nexcept their own.\r\n\r\nThe Workmen's and Soldiers' Councils of the whole country were also\r\ndisquieted by the announcement of the government that, with the\r\nconvening of the National Assembly, all political power would pass to\r\nthe assembly, and revolutionary government organs everywhere and of all\r\nkinds would cease to exist. This was not at all to the taste of most of\r\nthe members of the Soviets, who were affected less by political\r\nconsiderations than by the prospect of losing profitable sinecures and\r\nbeing compelled to earn a living by honest effort. The combined Soviets\r\nof Greater Berlin voted, 492 to 362, to demand the retention of the\r\nWorkmen's and Soldiers' Councils in any future state-form which might be\r\nadopted. Other Soviets followed the example, and there was talk of\r\nholding a rival congress in Berlin contemporaneously with the sessions\r\nof the National Assembly in Weimar. The Spartacans, already beginning to\r\nrecover from their defeats of a few days earlier, began planning another\r\n_coup_ for the first week of February.\r\n\r\nNoske's troops were kept constantly in action. The Bolsheviki in\r\nWilhelmshaven staged an armed uprising, but it was quickly put down.\r\nThey seized power in Bremen, defied the government to cast them out, and\r\nseveral regiments were required to defeat and disarm them. There was\r\nrioting in Magdeburg, and also in Duesseldorf. Polish aggressions,\r\nparticularly between Thorn and Graudenz, continued. It was difficult to\r\nmove troops against them because of the opposition of the Independents\r\nand Spartacans, and a great part of the soldiers, arrived at the front,\r\nrefused to remain and could not be detained, since, under Socialist\r\nmethods, they had the right to quit at any time on giving a week's\r\nnotice. Serious strikes further embarrassed and handicapped the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe determination and energy displayed by the cabinet in these difficult\r\ndays deserve generous acknowledgment, and especially so in view of the\r\nfact that it required a high degree of moral courage for any body of\r\nSocialist rulers to brave the denunciations of even well meaning\r\n_Genossen_ by relying on armed force to compel respect for their\r\nauthority and to carry out the mandate given them now by the great\r\nmajority of the German people. Preparations for the National Assembly\r\nwere well made. No person was permitted even to buy a railway ticket to\r\nWeimar unless he was in possession of a special pass bearing his\r\nphotograph, and a detachment of picked troops was sent to the city to\r\nprotect the assembly against interruption. Machine-guns commanded all\r\nentrances to the beautiful National Theater which had been converted to\r\nthe purposes of the assembly, and a special detail of experienced Berlin\r\npolicemen and plain-clothes detectives was on hand to assist the\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nThe local garrisons of Weimar, Eisenach, Gotha and other nearby places\r\nmade a futile attempt to prevent the sending of troops from Berlin, but\r\nnever got farther than the beginning. Their attitude was not due to any\r\npolitical considerations, but was dictated by selfishness and wounded\r\npride: they insisted that the sending of outside troops was an insult to\r\nthem, since they could furnish all the troops necessary to preserve\r\norder, and they also felt that they were entitled to the extra pay and\r\nrations dealt out to Noske's men.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly convened on February 6th with nearly a full\r\nattendance. It was called to order by Ebert, who appealed for unity and\r\nattacked the terms of the November armistice and the additional terms\r\nimposed at its renewals since. The speech received the approval of all\r\nmembers of the assembly except the Independent Socialists, who even on\r\nthis first day, started their tactics of obstruction, abuse of all\r\nspeakers except their own and rowdyish interruptions of the business of\r\nthe sessions.\r\n\r\nOn February 7th Dr. Eduard David, a scholarly man who had been for many\r\nyears one of the Majority Socialists' leaders, was elected president\r\n(speaker) of the National Assembly. The other officers chosen came from\r\nthe Christian, Democratic and Majority Socialist parties, the extreme\r\nRight and extreme Left being unrepresented. Organization having been\r\neffected, a provisional constitution was adopted establishing the\r\nAssembly as a law-giving body. It provided for the election of a\r\nNational President, to serve until his successor could be elected at a\r\ngeneral election, and for the appointment of a Minister-President and\r\nvarious ministers of state. The constitution created a so-called\r\nCommittee of State, to be named by the various state governments and to\r\noccupy the position of a Second Chamber, and empowered the assembly to\r\nenact \"such national laws as are urgently necessary,\" particularly\r\nrevenue and appropriation measures.\r\n\r\nFriedrich Ebert was elected Provisional President of the German Republic\r\non February 11th by a vote of 277 out of a total of 379 votes. Hardly a\r\ndecade earlier the German Emperor had stigmatized all the members of\r\nEbert's party as _vaterlandslose Gesellen_ and as \"men unworthy to bear\r\nthe name of German.\" Now, less than three months after that monarch had\r\nbeen overthrown, a Socialist was placed at the head of what was left of\r\nthe German Empire. A young and inconsequential Prussian lieutenant had\r\nsix years earlier been refused permission to marry the girl of his\r\nchoice because her mother sold eggs. The new President of the country\r\nhad been a saddler. He had once even been the owner of a small inn in\r\nHamburg.\r\n\r\nEbert belongs to that class which the French call the _petite\r\nbourgeoisie_, the lower middle class. He possesses all the solid,\r\ndomestic virtues of this class, and is a living exemplification of old\r\ncopy-book maxims about honesty as the best policy and faithfulness in\r\nlittle things. Without a trace of brilliancy and without any unusual\r\nmental qualities, his greatest strength lies in an honesty and\r\ndependability which, in the long run, so often outweigh great mental\r\ngifts. Few political leaders have ever enjoyed the confidence and trust\r\nof their followers to a greater degree.\r\n\r\nThe ministry chosen was headed by Scheidemann as Minister-President.\r\nOther members were: Minister of Defense (army and navy), Noske;\r\nInterior, Hugo Preuss; Justice, Sendsberg; Commerce, Hermann Mueller;\r\nLabor, Bauer; Foreign Affairs, Count Brockdorff-Rantzau; Under-Secretary\r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Baron von Richthofen; Finance, Dr. Schiffer; Posts\r\nand Telegraphs, Geisberg. Erzberger, David and Wissell were made\r\nministers without portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe first sessions of the National Assembly made on the whole a good\r\nimpression. The members were for the most part earnest men and women,\r\nfully up to the intellectual average of legislative bodies anywhere;\r\nthere were comparatively few among them who were compromised by\r\nrelations with the old government, and these were not in a position to\r\ndo no harm. The extreme Right was openly monarchic, but the members of\r\nthis group realized fully the hopelessness of any attempt to restore\r\neither the Hohenzollerns or a monarchic state-form at this time, and\r\nmanifested their loyalty to the former ruler only by objecting\r\nvigorously to Social-Democratic attacks on the Kaiser or to depreciation\r\nof the services of the crown in building up the Empire. Apart from the\r\npathologically hysterical conduct of the Independent Socialists, and\r\nparticularly of the three women delegates of that party, the assembly's\r\nproceedings were carried on in what was, by European parliamentary\r\nstandards, a dignified manner.\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning, however, the proceedings were sicklied o'er by\r\nthe pale cast of care. After the sufferings and losses of more than four\r\nyears of war, the country was now rent by internal dissensions and\r\nfratricidal strife. To the costs of war had been added hundreds of\r\nmillions lost to the state through the extravagance, dishonesty or\r\nincompetence of revolutionary officials and particularly Soviets. The\r\nformer net earnings of the state railways of nearly a billion marks had\r\nbeen converted into a deficit of two billions. Available sources of\r\nrevenue had been almost exhausted. The German currency had depreciated\r\nmore than sixty per cent. Industry was everywhere crippled by senseless\r\nstrikes.\r\n\r\nAn insight into Germany's financial situation was given by the report of\r\nFinance Minister Schiffer, who disclosed that the prodigious sum of\r\nnineteen billion marks would be required in the coming year to pay\r\ninterest charges alone. The war, he declared, had cost Germany one\r\nhundred and sixty-one billion marks, which exceeded by nearly fourteen\r\nbillions the credits that had been granted.\r\n\r\nThe incubus of the terrible armistice terms rested upon the assembly.\r\nEnemy newspapers, especially those of Paris, were daily publishing\r\nestimates of indemnities to be demanded from Germany, and the most\r\nmodest of these far exceeded Germany's total wealth of all descriptions.\r\nNaive German editors faithfully republished these articles, failing to\r\nrealize that they were part of the enemy propaganda and designed further\r\nto weaken the Germans' morale and increase their feeling of helplessness\r\nand despondency. Not even the fiercest German patriots and loyalists of\r\nthe old school could entirely shake off the feeling of helplessness that\r\novershadowed and influenced every act of the National Assembly.\r\n\r\nThe Majority Socialists had come to realize more fully the difference\r\nbetween theory and practice. The official organ of the German Federation\r\nof Labor had discovered a week earlier that \"the socialistic conquests\r\nof the revolution can be maintained only if countries competing with\r\nGerman industry adopt similar institutions.\" There were already concrete\r\nproofs available that socialization, even without regard to foreign\r\ncompetition, was not practical under the conditions prevailing in the\r\ncountry. At least two large factory owners in Northern Germany had\r\nhanded their plants over to their workmen and asked them to take full\r\ncharge of manufacture and sale. In both instances the workmen had, after\r\na trial, requested the owners to resume charge of the factories.\r\n\r\nHow shall we socialize when there is nothing to socialize? asked\r\nthoughtful men. The answer was obvious. _Gegen den Tod ist kein Kraut\r\ngewachsen_ (there is no remedy against death) says an old German\r\nproverb, and industry was practically dead. The government party now\r\ndiscovered what Marx and Engels had discovered nearly fifty years\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\"The practical application of these principles will always and\r\neverywhere depend upon historically existing conditions. * * * The\r\nCommune has supplied the proof that the laboring class cannot simply\r\ntake possession of the machinery of state and set it in motion for its\r\nown purposes.\"[63]\r\n\r\n[63] Introduction to the second edition of the Manifesto of 1849,\r\n    quoted in chapter iii.\r\n\r\nThe tardy realization of this fact placed the delegates of the\r\ngovernment party in a serious dilemma. Sweeping socialization had been\r\npromised, and the rank and file of the party expected and demanded it.\r\nIn these circumstances it was obvious that a failure to carry out what\r\nwas at the same time a party doctrine and a campaign pledge would have\r\nserious consequences, and it must be reckoned to the credit of the\r\nleaders of the party that they put the material welfare of the state\r\nabove party considerations and refused to let themselves be hurried into\r\ndisastrous experiments along untried lines. Their attitude resulted in\r\ndriving many of the members of the Socialist party into the ranks of the\r\nIndependents, but in view of the fact that the government nevertheless\r\nremained strong enough to defeat these elements wherever they had\r\nrecourse to violence, and of the further fact that to accede to the\r\ndemands of these intransigeants would have given the final blow to what\r\nlittle remained of German industry, the leaders must be said to have\r\nacted wisely and patriotically.\r\n\r\nWith organization effected, the National Assembly settled down to work.\r\nBut it was work as all similar German organizations in history had\r\nalways understood it. All the political immaturity, the tendency to\r\nphilosophical and abstract reasoning, the ineradicable devotion to the\r\nmerely academic and the disregard of practical questions that are such\r\nprominent characteristics of the people were exhibited just as they had\r\nbeen at the Congress at Frankfort-on-the-Main seventy years earlier. It\r\nhas been written of that Congress:\r\n\r\n    \"But the Germans had had no experience of free political life.\r\n    Nearly every deputy had his own theory of the course which ought\r\n    to be pursued, and felt sure that the country would go to ruin\r\n    if it were not adopted. Learned professors and talkative\r\n    journalists insisted on delivering interminable speeches and on\r\n    examining in the light of ultimate philosophical principles\r\n    every proposal laid before the assembly. Thus precious time was\r\n    lost, violent antagonisms were called forth, the patience of the\r\n    nation was exhausted, and the reactionary forces were able to\r\n    gather strength for once more asserting themselves.\"[64]\r\n\r\n    [64] _Encyclopedia Britannica_, title \"Germany.\"\r\n\r\nExcept that the reactionary forces were too weakly represented at Weimar\r\nto make them an actual source of danger this characterization of the\r\nFrankfort Congress might have been written about the proceedings of the\r\nNational Assembly of February. It is a significant and illuminating fact\r\nthat the greatest animation exhibited at any time during the first week\r\nof the assembly was aroused by a difference of meaning as to the\r\ndefinition of a word. Professor Hugo Preuss, Prussian Minister of the\r\nInterior, to whom had been entrusted the task of drafting a proposed\r\nconstitution for the new republic, referred in a speech elucidating it,\r\nto \"an absolute majority.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does 'absolute majority' mean a majority of the whole number of\r\ndelegates?\" asked some learned delegate.\r\n\r\nThe other delegates were galvanized instantly into the tensest interest.\r\nHere was a question worth while! What does \"absolute majority\" mean? An\r\nanimated debate followed and was listened to with a breathless interest\r\nwhich the most weighty financial or economic questions had never\r\nsucceeded in evoking.\r\n\r\nAnd while the National Assembly droned thus wearily on, clouds were\r\nagain gathering over Berlin and other cities in the troubled young\r\nrepublic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n                       The Spartacans Rise Again.\r\n\r\n\r\nArticle xxvi of the armistice of November 11th declared:\r\n\r\n    \"The Allies and the United States have in view the provisioning\r\n    of Germany during the armistice to the extent deemed\r\n    necessary.\"[65]\r\n\r\n    [65] Les Allies et les Etats-Unis envisagent le ravitaillement\r\n        de l'Allemagne, pendant l'armistice, dans la mesure reconnue\r\n        necessaire.\r\n\r\nEven by the end of November it had become apparent to all intelligent\r\nobservers on the ground and to many outside Germany that such\r\nprovisioning was urgently necessary, and that if it did not come at once\r\nthe result would be a spread of Bolshevism which would endanger all\r\nEurope. Allied journalists in Germany were almost a unit in recognizing\r\nthe dangers and demands of the situation, but they were greatly hampered\r\nin their efforts to picture the situation truthfully by the sentiments\r\nprevailing in their respective countries as a result of the passions\r\nengendered by the conflict so lately ended. This was in the highest\r\ndegree true as to the Americans, which was especially regrettable and\r\nunfortunate in view of the fact that America was the only power\r\npossessing a surplus of immediately available foodstuffs. American\r\ncorrespondents, venturing to report actual conditions in Germany, found\r\nthemselves denounced as \"pro-Germans\" and traitors by the readers of\r\ntheir papers. More than this: they became the objects of unfavorable\r\nreports by officers of the American Military Intelligence, although many\r\nof these men themselves were convinced that empty stomachs were breeding\r\nBolshevism with every passing day. One correspondent, who had been so\r\nbitterly anti-German from the very beginning of the war that he had had\r\nto leave Germany long before America entered the struggle, was denounced\r\nin a report to the Military Intelligence at Washington on March 3d as\r\n\"having shown pro-German leanings throughout the war.\" An American\r\ncorrespondent with a long and honorable record, who had taken a\r\nprominent part in carrying on American propaganda abroad and upon whose\r\nreports high diplomatic officials of three of the Allied countries had\r\nrelied, was astounded to learn that the Military Intelligence, in a\r\nreport of January 11, 1919, had denounced him as \"having gone to Berlin\r\nto create sentiment in the United States favorable to furnishing Germany\r\nfood-supply.\"\r\n\r\nThere was less of this sort of thing in England, and many prominent\r\nEnglishmen were early awake to the dangers that lay in starvation. Early\r\nin January Lord Henry Bentinck, writing to the London _Daily News_,\r\ndeclared there was no sense in maintaining the blockade. It was\r\nhindering the development of industry and the employment of the idle in\r\nEngland, and in Middle Europe it was killing children and keeping\r\nmillions hungry and unemployed. The blockade, said Lord Henry, was the\r\nBolshevists' best friend and had no purpose except to enable England to\r\ncut off her own nose in order to spite Germany's face. Many other\r\nleaders of thought in England took the same stand.\r\n\r\nDespite the (at least inferential) promise in the armistice that Germany\r\nshould be revictualled, not a step had been taken toward doing this\r\nwhen, on January 13th, more than two months after the signing of the\r\narmistice, President Wilson sent a message to administration leaders in\r\nCongress urging the appropriation of one hundred million dollars for\r\nfood-relief in Europe.\r\n\r\n\"Food-relief is now the key to the whole European situation and to the\r\nsolution of peace,\" said the President. \"Bolshevism is steadily\r\nadvancing westward; is poisoning Germany. It cannot be stopped by force,\r\nbut it can be stopped by food, and all the leaders with whom I am in\r\nconference agree that concerted action in this matter is of immediate\r\nand vital importance.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, so good. This was a step in the right direction. But it had to\r\nbe qualified. This was done in the next paragraph:\r\n\r\n    \"The money will not be spent for food for Germany itself,\r\n    because Germany can buy its food, but it will be spent for\r\n    financing the movement of food to our real friends in Poland and\r\n    to the people of the liberated units of the Austro-Hungarian\r\n    Empire and to our associates in the Balkans.\r\n\r\nFormer Ambassador Henry White, a member of the American peace\r\ndelegation, supported the President's appeal with a message stating that\r\n\"the startling westward advance of Bolshevism now dominates the entire\r\nEuropean situation. * * * The only effective barrier against it is\r\nfood-relief.\"\r\n\r\nThe House adopted the President's recommendation without question, but\r\nthe Senate insisted on adding a stipulation that no part of the money\r\nshould be spent for food for Germany and no food bought with these funds\r\nshould be permitted to reach that country.\r\n\r\nJust how an ulcer in Germany was to be cured by poulticing similar\r\nulcers in other countries is doubtless a statesmen's secret. It is not\r\napparent to non-official minds. Germany, despite her poverty and the\r\ndepreciation of her currency, might have been able to buy food, but she\r\nwas not permitted to buy any food. At least one of \"the liberated units\r\nof the Austro-Hungarian Empire\" was in equally bad case. Count Michael\r\nKarolyi, addressing the People's Assembly at Budapest, declared that the\r\nAllies were not carrying out their part of the armistice agreement in\r\nthe matter of food-supplies for Hungary, and that it was impossible to\r\nmaintain order in such conditions. Whether the armistice actually\r\npromised to supply food is a matter of interpretation; that no food had\r\nbeen supplied is, however, a matter of history.\r\n\r\nOn January 17th a supplementary agreement was entered into between the\r\nAllies and Germany, in which the former undertook to permit the\r\nimportation of two hundred thousand tons of breadstuffs and seventy\r\nthousand tons of pork products to Germany \"in such manner and from such\r\nplaces as the Associated Governments may prescribe.\" This was but a part\r\nof the actual requirements of Germany for a single month, but if it had\r\nbeen supplied quickly it would have gone far toward simplifying the\r\ntremendous problem of maintaining a semblance of order in Germany.\r\n\r\nWeeks passed, however, and no food came. With the Bolshevik\r\nconflagration spreading from city to city, long debates were carried on\r\nas to what fire department should be summoned and what kind of uniforms\r\nthe firemen should wear. More districts of East Prussia and Posen, the\r\nchief granaries of Northeastern Germany and Berlin, were lost to\r\nGermany. There was a serious shortage of coal and gas in the cities.\r\n\r\nStrikes became epidemic. Work was no longer occasionally interrupted by\r\nstrikes; strikes were occasionally interrupted by work. Berlin's\r\nelectric power-plant workers threw the city into darkness, and the\r\nexample was followed in other cities. The proletarians were apparently\r\nquite as ready to exploit their brother proletarians as the capitalists\r\nwere. Coal miners either quit work entirely or insisted on a seven-hour\r\nday which included an hour and a half spent in coming to and going from\r\nwork, making the net result a day of five and a half hours. Street-car\r\nemployees struck, and for days the undernourished people of the capital\r\nwalked miles to work and home again. The shops were closed by strikes,\r\nstenographers and typewriters walked out; drivers of garbage wagons,\r\nalready receiving the pay of cabinet ministers, demanded more pay and\r\ngot it. From every corner of the country came reports of labor troubles,\r\noften accompanied by rioting and sabotage.\r\n\r\nIn most of these strikes the hand of Spartacus and the Independent\r\nSocialists could be discerned. The working people, hungry and miserable,\r\nwaiting vainly week after week for the food which they believed had been\r\npromised them, were tinder for the Bolshevist spark. The government's\r\nunwise method of handling the problem of the unemployed further greatly\r\naggravated the situation. The support granted the unemployed often or\r\nperhaps generally was greater than their pay in their usual callings. A\r\nman with a wife and four children in Greater Berlin received more than\r\nfourteen marks daily. The average wage for unskilled labor was from ten\r\nto twelve marks, and the result was that none but the most conscientious\r\nendeavored to secure employment, and thousands deliberately left their\r\nwork and lived on their unemployment-allowances. Two hundred thousand\r\nresidents of Greater Berlin were receiving daily support from the city\r\nby the middle of February, and this proportion was generally maintained\r\nthroughout the country. This vast army of unemployed further crippled\r\nindustry, imposed serious financial burdens upon an already bankrupt\r\nstate, and--inevitable result of idleness--made the task of Bolshevist\r\nagitators easier.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans, who since their defeat in Berlin in January had been\r\nmore carefully watched, began to assemble their forces elsewhere. Essen\r\nbecame their chief stronghold, and the whole Ruhr district, including\r\nDuesseldorf, was virtually in their hands. Other Spartacan centers were\r\nLeipsic, Halle, Merseburg, Munich, Nuremberg, Mannheim and Augsburg. All\r\nthis time, however, they were also feverishly active in Berlin. A\r\ngeneral strike, called by the Spartacans and Independent Socialists for\r\nthe middle of February, collapsed. A secret sitting of the leaders of\r\nthe Red Soldiers' League on February 15th was surprised by the\r\nauthorities, who arrested all men present and thus nipped in the bud for\r\na time further preparations for a new revolt. The Independents made\r\ncommon cause with the Spartacans in demanding the liberation of all\r\n\"political prisoners,\" chief among whom were Ledebour, who helped\r\norganize the revolt of January 5th, and Radek, \"this international\r\ncriminal,\" as Deputy Heinrich Heine termed him in a speech before the\r\nPrussian Diet.\r\n\r\nThe respite, however, was short. On Monday, March 3d, the Workmen's\r\nCouncil now completely in the hands of the enemies of the government\r\ncalled a general strike. Street cars, omnibuses and interurban trains\r\nstopped running, all business was suspended and nightfall plunged the\r\ncity into complete darkness. This was the signal for the first\r\ndisturbances. There was considerable rioting, with some loss of blood,\r\nin the eastern part of the city beyond Alexander Platz, a section always\r\nnoted as the home of a large criminal element. Spartacans, reinforced by\r\nthe hooligan and criminal element--or let it rather be said that these\r\nconsisted and had from the beginning consisted mainly of hooligans and\r\ncriminals--began a systematic attack on police-stations everywhere.\r\nThirty-three stations were occupied by them during the night, the police\r\nofficials were disarmed and their weapons distributed to the rabble that\r\nwas constantly swelling the ranks of the rebels.\r\n\r\nThe first serious clash of this second Bolshevik week came at the\r\nPolice-Presidency, which the Spartacans, as in January, planned to make\r\ntheir headquarters. This time, however, the building was occupied by\r\nloyal government troops, and the incipient attack dissolved before a few\r\nvolleys. The night was marked by extensive looting. Jewelers in the\r\neastern part of the city suffered losses aggregating many million marks.\r\n\r\nThe situation grew rapidly worse on Tuesday. Nearly thirty thousand\r\ngovernment troops marched into the city, bringing light and heavy\r\nartillery, mine-throwers and machine-guns. Berlin was converted into an\r\narmed camp. The revolt would have been quickly put down but for an\r\noccurrence made possible by the government's weakness at Christmas time.\r\nThe People's Marine Division, looters of the Royal Palace, parasites on\r\nthe city's payroll and \"guardians of the public safety,\" threw off the\r\nmask and went over to the Spartacans in a body. A considerable number of\r\nthe Republican Soldier Guards, Eichhorn's legacy to Berlin, followed\r\nsuit. The government's failure to disarm these forces six weeks earlier,\r\nwhen their Bolshevist sentiments had become manifest, now had to be paid\r\nfor in blood. The defection was serious not only because it added to the\r\nnumbers of the Bolsheviki, but also because it greatly increased the\r\nsupplies of weapons and munitions at the disposal of the enemies of the\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nThe defection, too, came as a surprise and at a most unfortunate time.\r\nThe Marine Division, upon which the commanders of the government troops\r\nhad naively depended, had been ordered to clear the Alexander Platz, a\r\nlarge open place in front of the Police-Presidency. They began\r\nostensibly to carry out the order, but had hardly reached the place when\r\nthey declared that they had been fired on by government troops.\r\nThereupon they attacked the Police-Presidency, but were beaten off with\r\nsome twenty-five killed. They withdrew to the Marine House at the\r\nJannowitz Bridge, which they had been occupying since their expulsion\r\nfrom the Royal Stables, and set about fortifying it.\r\n\r\nThe following day--Ash Wednesday--was marked by irregular but severe\r\nfighting in various parts of the city. The government proclaimed a state\r\nof siege. More loyal troops were brought to the city. From captured\r\nSpartacans it was learned that a massed attack on the Police-Presidency\r\nwas to be made at eleven o'clock at night by the People's Marine\r\nDivision, the Red Soldiers' League and civilian Spartacans. The assault\r\ndid not begin until nearly three o'clock Thursday morning. Despite the\r\ngovernment troops' disposition, the Spartacans succeeded, after heavy\r\nbombardment of the building, in occupying two courts in the southern\r\nwing. The battle was carried on throughout the night and until Thursday\r\nafternoon. Few cities have witnessed such civil warfare. Every\r\ninstrument known to military science was used, with the exception of\r\npoison-gases. Late on Thursday afternoon the attackers were dispersed\r\nand the Spartacans in the Police-Presidency, about fifty men, were\r\narrested.\r\n\r\nThe Marine House was also captured on the same afternoon. The defenders\r\nhoisted the white flag after a few mines had been thrown into the\r\nbuilding, but had disappeared when the government troops occupied it.\r\nWhat their defection to the Spartacans had meant was illustrated by the\r\nfinding in the building of several thousand rifles, more than a hundred\r\nmachine guns, two armored automobiles and great quantities of ammunition\r\nand provisions. The Republican Soldiers' Guard, barricaded in the Royal\r\nStables, surrendered after a few shells had been fired.\r\n\r\nThe fighting so completely took on the aspects of a real war that the\r\nwildest atrocity stories began to circulate. They were, like all\r\natrocity stories, greatly exaggerated, but it was established that\r\nSpartacans had killed unarmed prisoners, including several policemen,\r\nhad stopped and wrecked ambulances and killed wounded, and had\r\nsystematically fired on first-aid stations and hospitals. Noske rose to\r\nthe occasion like a mere _bourgeois_ minister. He decreed:\r\n\r\n    \"All persons found with arms in their hands, resisting\r\n    government troops, will be summarily executed.\"\r\n\r\nDespite this decree, the Spartacans, who had erected street-barricades\r\nin that part of Berlin eastward and northward from Alexander Platz, put\r\nup a show of resistance for some days. They were, however, seriously\r\nshaken by their heavy losses and weakened by the wholesale defections of\r\nsupporters who had joined them chiefly for the sake of looting and who\r\nhad a wholesale respect for Noske as a man of his word. They had good\r\nreason to entertain this respect for the grim man in charge of the\r\ngovernment's military measures. The government never made public the\r\nnumber of summary executions under Noske's decree, but there is little\r\ndoubt that these went well above one hundred. A group of members of the\r\nmutinous People's Marine Division had the splendid effrontery to call at\r\nthe office of the city commandant to demand the pay due them as\r\nprotectors of the public safety. Government troops arrested the callers,\r\na part of whom resisted arrest. Twenty-four of these men, found to have\r\nweapons in their possession, were summarily executed.\r\n\r\n_Die Freiheit_ and _Die Republik_ denounced the members of the\r\ngovernment as murderers. The office of the Spartacans' _Die rote Fahne_\r\nhad been occupied by government troops on the day of the outbreak of the\r\nBolshevik uprising. The _bourgeois_ and Majority Socialist press\r\nsupported the government whole-heartedly, and the law-abiding citizens\r\nwere encouraged by their new rulers' energy and by the loyalty and\r\nbravery of the government troops. There was a general recognition of the\r\nfact that matters had reached a stage where a minority, in part deluded\r\nand in part criminal, could not longer be permitted to terrorize the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe uprising collapsed rapidly after the Spartacans had been driven\r\nfrom their main strongholds. They maintained themselves for a few days\r\nin Lichtenberg, a suburb of Berlin, and--as in the January\r\nuprisings--sniping from housetops continued for a week. No list of\r\ncasualties was ever issued, but estimates ran as high as one thousand,\r\nof which probably three-quarters were suffered by the Spartacans. They\r\nwere further badly weakened by the loss of a great part of their\r\nweapons, both during the fighting and in a general clean-up of the city\r\nwhich was made after the uprising had been definitely put down.\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the efforts of the German Bolsheviki, aided by the left\r\nwing of the Independent Socialists, to overthrow the government by force\r\nhad failed wherever the attempt had been made. Not only in Berlin, but\r\nin a dozen other cities and districts as well, the enemies of democracy\r\nhad been decisively defeated. In Munich and Brunswick alone they were\r\nstill strong and defiant, but they were to be defeated even there later.\r\nIn these circumstances it might have been expected that they would not\r\nagain be able to cause serious trouble to the government. But a new\r\naspect was put on circumstances by an occurrence whose inevitability had\r\nlong been recognized by close observers.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Social-Democratic Party went over to the Spartacans\r\nofficially, bag and baggage.\r\n\r\nIn theory, to be sure, it did nothing of the kind. It maintained its own\r\norganization, \"rejected planless violence,\" declared its adherence to\r\n\"the fundamental portion of the Erfurt program,\" and asserted its\r\nreadiness to use \"all political and economic means\" to attain its aims,\r\n\"including parliaments,\" which were rejected by the Spartacans. Apart\r\nfrom this, however, there was little difference in theory and none in\r\npractice between the platforms of the two parties, for the Independents\r\ndeclared themselves for Soviet government and for the dictatorship of\r\nthe proletariat, and their rejection of violent methods existed only on\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nThe party congress convened at Berlin on March 2d and lasted four days.\r\nHaase and Dittmann, the former cabinet members, were again in control,\r\nand it could not be observed in their attitude that there had been a\r\ntime when they risked a loss of influence in the party by standing too\r\nfar to the right. The \"revolution-program\" adopted by the party declared\r\nthat the revolutionary soldiers and workingmen of Germany, who had\r\nseized the power of the state in November, \"have not fortified their\r\npower nor overcome the capitalistic class-domination.\" It continued:\r\n\r\n    \"The leaders of the Socialists of the Right (Majority) have\r\n    renewed their pact with the _bourgeois_ classes and deserted the\r\n    interests of the proletariat. They are carrying on a befogging\r\n    policy with the words 'democracy' and 'Socialism.'\r\n\r\n    \"In a capitalistic social order democratic forms are a deceit.\r\n    So long as economic liberation and independence do not follow\r\n    upon political liberation there is no true democracy.\r\n    Socialization, as the Socialists of the Right are carrying it\r\n    out, is a comedy.\"\r\n\r\nThe program declared a new proletarian battling organization necessary,\r\nand continued:\r\n\r\n    \"The proletarian revolution has created such an organization in\r\n    the Soviet system. This unites for revolutionary activities the\r\n    laboring masses in the industries. It gives the proletariat the\r\n    right of self-government in industries, in municipalities and in\r\n    the state. It carries through the change of the capitalistic\r\n    economic order to a socialistic order.\r\n\r\n    \"In all capitalistic lands the Soviet system is growing out of\r\n    the same economic conditions and becoming the bearer of the\r\n    proletarian world-revolution.\r\n\r\n    \"It is the historic mission of the Independent Social-Democratic\r\n    Party to become the standard bearer of the class-conscious\r\n    proletariat in its revolutionary war of emancipation.\r\n\r\n    \"The Independent Social-Democratic Party places itself upon the\r\n    foundation of the Soviet system. It supports the Soviets in\r\n    their struggle for economic and political power.\r\n\r\n    \"It strives for the dictatorship of the proletariat, the\r\n    representatives of the great majority of the people, as a\r\n    necessary condition precedent for the effectuation of Socialism.\r\n\r\n    \"In order to attain this end the party will employ all political\r\n    and economic means of battle, including parliaments.\" With this\r\n    preface, these \"immediate demands\" of the party were set forth:\r\n\r\n    \"1. Inclusion of the Soviet system in the constitution: the\r\n    Soviets to have a deciding voice in municipal, state and\r\n    industrial legislation.\r\n\r\n    \"2. Complete disbandment of the old army. Immediate disbandment\r\n    of the mercenary army formed from volunteer corps. Organization\r\n    of a national guard from the ranks of the class-conscious\r\n    proletariat. Self-administration of the national guard and\r\n    election of leaders by the men. Abolishment of courts-martial.\r\n\r\n    \"3. The nationalization of capitalistic undertakings shall be\r\n    begun immediately. It shall be carried through without delay in\r\n    the mining industry and production of energy (coal, water,\r\n    electricity), iron and steel production as well as other highly\r\n    developed industries, and in the banking and insurance business.\r\n    Large estates and forests shall immediately be converted into\r\n    the property of society, whose task it shall be to raise all\r\n    economic undertakings to the highest point of productivity by\r\n    the employment of all technical and economic means, as well as\r\n    to further comradeship. Privately owned real estate in the\r\n    cities shall become municipal property, and the municipalities\r\n    shall build an adequate number of dwellings on their own\r\n    account.\r\n\r\n    \"4. Election of officials and judges by the people. Immediate\r\n    constitution of a state court which shall determine the\r\n    responsibility of those persons guilty of bringing on the war\r\n    and of hindering the earlier conclusion of peace.\r\n\r\n    \"5. War profits shall be taxed entirely out of existence. A\r\n    portion of all large fortunes shall be handed over to the state.\r\n    Public expenditures shall be covered by a graduated tax on\r\n    incomes, fortunes and inheritances. The war loans shall be\r\n    annulled, but necessitous individuals, associations serving the\r\n    common welfare, institutions and municipalities shall be\r\n    indemnified.\r\n\r\n    \"6. Extension of social legislation. Protection and care of\r\n    mother and child. A care-free existence shall be assured to war\r\n    widows and orphans and the wounded. Superfluous rooms of the\r\n    possessing class shall be placed at the disposition of the\r\n    homeless. Fundamental reform of public-health systems.\r\n\r\n    \"7. Separation of church from state and of church from school.\r\n    Uniform public schools of secular character, which shall be\r\n    erected on socialistic-pedagogic principles. Every child shall\r\n    have a right to an education corresponding to his capacities,\r\n    and to the furnishing of means toward that end.\r\n\r\n    \"8. A public monopoly of newspaper advertisements shall be\r\n    created for the benefit of municipalities.\r\n\r\n    \"9. Establishment of friendly relations with all nations.\r\n    Immediate resumption of diplomatic relations with the Russian\r\n    Soviet Republic and Poland. Reestablishment of the Workmen's\r\n    _Internationale_ on the basis of revolutionary social policy in\r\n    the spirit of the international conferences of Zimmerwald and\r\n    Kienthal.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the difference between these demands and those\r\nof the Bolsheviki (Spartacans) is precisely the difference between\r\ntweedledum and tweedledee--one of terminology. Some even of these\r\nprinciples were materially extended by interpretation three weeks later.\r\nOn March 24th the Independent Socialists in the new Prussian Diet,\r\nreplying to a query from the Majority Socialists as to their willingness\r\nto participate in the coming Prussian Constituent Assembly, stated\r\nconditions which contained the following elaboration of point 3 in the\r\nprogram given above:\r\n\r\n    \"The most important means of production in agriculture,\r\n    industry, trade and commerce shall be nationalized immediately;\r\n    the land and its natural resources shall be declared to be the\r\n    property of the whole people and shall be placed under the\r\n    control of society.\"\r\n\r\nThe answer, by the way, was signed by Adolph Hoffmann, whose\r\nacquaintance we have already made, and Kurt Rosenfeld, the millionaire\r\nson-in-law of a wealthy leather dealer.\r\n\r\nThe essential kinship of the Independents and Spartacans will be more\r\nclearly apparent from a comparison of the latters' demands, as published\r\non April 14th in _Die rote Fahne_, then appearing in Leipsic. They\r\nfollow:\r\n\r\n    \"Ruthless elimination of all Majority Socialist leaders and of\r\n    such Independents as have betrayed the Soviet system and the\r\n    revolution by their cooperation with Majority Socialists.\r\n\r\n    \"Unconditional acceptance of the demands of the Spartacus\r\n    Party's program.[66]\r\n\r\n    [66] _Vide_ chapter xi.\r\n\r\n    \"Immediate introduction of the following measures: (a)\r\n    Liberation of all political prisoners; (b) dissolution of all\r\n    parliamentary gatherings; (c) dissolution of all\r\n    counter-revolutionary troop detachments, disarming of the\r\n    _bourgeoisie_ and the internment of all officers; (d) arming of\r\n    the proletariat and the immediate organization of revolutionary\r\n    corps; (e) abolition of all courts and the erection of\r\n    revolutionary tribunals, together with the trial by these\r\n    tribunals of all persons involved in bringing on the war, of\r\n    counter-revolutionaries and traitors; (f) elimination of all\r\n    state administrative officials and boards (mayors, provincial\r\n    councillors, etc.), and the substitution of delegates chosen by\r\n    the people; (g) adoption of a law providing for the taking over\r\n    by the state without indemnification of all larger undertakings\r\n    (mines, etc.), together with the larger landed estates, and the\r\n    immediate taking over of the administration of these estates by\r\n    workmen's councils; (h) adoption of a law annulling war-loans\r\n    exceeding twenty thousand marks; (i) suppression of the whole\r\n    _bourgeois_ press, including particularly the Majority Socialist\r\n    press.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the members of the former right wing of the Independent\r\nSocialists left the party and went over to the Majority Socialists\r\nfollowing the party congress of the first week in March. They included\r\nthe venerable Eduard Bernstein, who declared that the Independents had\r\ndemonstrated that they \"lacked utterly any constructive program.\" The\r\ndictates of party discipline, however, together with the desperation of\r\nsuffering, were too much for the great mass of those who had at first\r\nrejected Bolshevist methods, and the German Bolsheviki received material\r\nreinforcements at a time when they would have been powerless without\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe Spartacans had lost their armed battle against the government, but\r\nthey had won a more important bloodless conflict.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n                    Red or White Internationalism Which?\r\n\r\n\r\nAll revolutions have their second phase, and this phase ordinarily\r\npresents features similar in kind and varying only in degree. After the\r\nactual overthrow of the old government a short period of excited\r\noptimism gives place to a realization of the fact that the\r\nadministration of a state is not so simple as it has appeared to the\r\nopposition parties, and that the existing order of things--the result of\r\ncenturies of natural development--cannot be altered over night. Under\r\nthe sobering influence of this realization ultra-radicalism loses\r\nground, the revolutionary government accepts the aid of some of the men\r\nwho have been connected with the deposed government, and the\r\nadministration of affairs proceeds along an orderly middle course.\r\n\r\nBut other revolutions, as has been stated, have had a different\r\ninception, and none have depended for their successful execution and\r\nsubsequent development on a people so sorely tried, so weakened\r\nphysically and morally, and--last but not least--so extensively infected\r\nwith the virus of internationalism. In so far as revolutions were not\r\nthe work of a group of selfish aspirants for power, they were brought\r\nabout by patriotic men whose first and last thought was the welfare of\r\ntheir own country, and who concerned themselves not at all about the\r\nuniversal brotherhood of man or the oppressed peoples of other lands or\r\nraces. The German revolutionists, however, scoffed at patriotism as an\r\noutworn dogma. The majority of their adherents came from the poorest and\r\nmost ignorant stratum of the people, the class most responsive to the\r\nagitation of leaders who promised that division of property contemplated\r\nby Communist Socialism.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Socialists had \"made the revolution.\" They claimed the\r\nright to determine its development. The _bourgeoisie_, itself incapable\r\nof restoring the old order and, for the most part, not desiring to do\r\nso, supported the parent Socialist Party as the lesser of two evils. The\r\nIndependents found themselves without the power to determine what course\r\n\"their revolution\" should take. All revolutionary history showed that\r\nthis course would not be that desired by the Independent leaders and\r\npromised by them to their radical followers. The occurrences of the\r\nfirst month following the revolution again demonstrated what might be\r\ncalled the natural law of revolutionary development. The Majority\r\nSocialists in the government refused to let themselves be hurried into\r\ndisastrous socializing experiments. They refused to ban intelligence and\r\nability merely because the possessors happened not to be _Genossen_.\r\nThey even believed (_horribile dictu!_) that private property-rights\r\nshould not be abolished out of hand. They were so recreant to the\r\nprinciples of true internationalism that they resented foreign\r\naggressions against Germans and German soil, and they actually proposed\r\nto resist such aggressions by force.\r\n\r\nWith heretics like these there could be no communion. They could not\r\neven be permitted to hold communion among themselves if it could be\r\nprevented, and the result was, as we have seen, the efforts of the\r\nIndependents and Spartacans to wreck the tabernacle.\r\n\r\nTo recount the developments of the period from the crushing of the March\r\nuprising to the signing of the Peace of Versailles would be but to\r\nrepeat, with different settings, the story of the first four months of\r\nRepublican Germany. This period, too, was filled with Independent\r\nSocialist and Spartacan intrigues and armed opposition to the\r\ngovernment, culminating in the brief but bloody reign of the Communists\r\nin Munich in April. Strikes continued to paralyze industry. No food\r\nsupplies of any importance were received. The National Assembly at\r\nWeimar continued to demonstrate the philosophic tendencies, academic\r\nlearning and political immaturity of the German people. Distinct left\r\nwings came into being in both the Majority Socialist and Democratic\r\nparties. Particularism, the historic curse of the country, again raised\r\nits head.\r\n\r\nRed internationalism in Germany received a marked impetus from the\r\nevents in Hungary at the end of March, when Count Michael Karolyi handed\r\nthe reins of government over to the Bolshevist leader Bela Kun. An\r\neffort has been made to represent this as a bit of theatricals staged by\r\nKarolyi with the support and encouragement of Berlin. Such an\r\nexplanation is symptomatic of the blindness of those who will not see\r\nthe significance of this development. To assert that the German\r\nGovernment, itself engaged in a life-and-death struggle with Bolshevism\r\nat home and threatened with an irruption of the Bolshevist forces of\r\nRussia, would deliberately create a new source of infection in a\r\ncontiguous land requires either much mental hardihood or a deep\r\nignorance of existing conditions. The author is able to state from\r\nfirst-hand knowledge that the German Government was completely surprised\r\nby the news from Budapest, and that it had no part, direct or indirect,\r\nin bringing about Karolyi's resignation or the accession to power of the\r\nHungarian Bolsheviki.\r\n\r\nThe developments in Hungary were made inevitable by the unwisdom with\r\nwhich this \"liberated unit of the Austro-Hungarian Empire\" was treated.\r\nWhen the November armistice was concluded, there was a \"gentlemen's\r\nagreement\" or understanding that the demarcation line established by the\r\narmistice should be policed by French, English or American troops. It\r\nwas not observed. Jugo-Slavs, Serbians and Roumanians were permitted not\r\nonly to guard this line, but to advance well beyond it. The enemy\r\noccupation of the country extended to nearly all portions of Hungary\r\nupon which the central part, including Budapest, depended for coal,\r\nmetals, wood, meats and even salt. The Czechs took possession of\r\nPressburg, rechristened it Wilson City, and advanced along the Danube to\r\nwithin twenty miles of Budapest. Distress became acute.\r\n\r\nThen, on March 19th, the French Colonel Vix sent a note to Karolyi\r\nestablishing a new demarcation line far inside the one established in\r\nNovember and at places even inside the lines held by Allied troops.\r\nKarolyi's position was already insecure. He had been welcomed when he\r\nassumed office as the restorer of nationalism and peace. The support\r\naccorded him had been largely due to his record as an opponent of\r\nAustria and a friend of the Entente. He had been under surveillance\r\nalmost throughout the war because of his known pro-Ally sentiments, and\r\nonly his prominence saved him from arrest. Now, when his supposed\r\ninfluence with the Allies was discovered to be non-existent, his only\r\nremaining support was shattered and he went. Hungary, infected with\r\nBolshevism by Russian propagandists and returned prisoners of war, went\r\nover to the camp of Lenine.\r\n\r\nAnother factor contributed greatly to the growth of the radical\r\nIndependent Socialist and Bolshevist movement in Germany. This was the\r\nobvious dilemma of the Allies in the case of Russia, their undeniable\r\nhelplessness and lack of counsel in the face of applied Bolshevism.\r\nThousands of Germans came to believe that Bolshevism was a haven of\r\nrefuge. Nor was this sentiment by any means confined to the proletariat.\r\nA Berlin millionaire said to the writer in March:\r\n\r\n    \"If it comes to a question of choosing between Bolshevism and\r\n    Allied slavery, I shall become a Bolshevik without hesitation. I\r\n    would rather see Germany in the possession of Bolshevist Germans\r\n    than of any _bourgeois_ government wearing chains imposed by our\r\n    enemies. The Allies dare not intervene in Russia, and I don't\r\n    believe they would be any less helpless before a Bolshevist\r\n    Germany.\"\r\n\r\nScores of well-to-do Germans expressed themselves in the same strain to\r\nthe author, and thousands from the lower classes, free from the\r\nrestraint which the possession of worldly goods imposes, put into\r\nexecution the threat of their wealthier countrymen.\r\n\r\nWith the conclusion of the peace of Versailles we leave Germany. The\r\nsecond phase of the revolution is not yet ended. Bolshevism, crushed in\r\none place, raises its head in another. Industry is prostrate. Currency\r\nis so depreciated that importation is seriously hampered. The event is\r\non the knees of the gods.\r\n\r\nBut while the historian can thus arbitrarily dismiss Germany and the\r\nconditions created by the great war, the world cannot. From a material\r\neconomic viewpoint alone, the colossal destruction of wealth and means\r\nof transportation, and the slaughter of millions of the able-bodied men\r\nof all nations involved are factors which will make themselves felt for\r\nmany years. These obstacles to development and progress will, however,\r\neventually be overcome. They are the least of the problems facing the\r\nworld today as the result of the war and--this must be said now and it\r\nwill eventually be realized generally--as a result of the Peace of\r\nVersailles. The men responsible for this peace declare that it is the\r\nbest that could be made. Until the proceedings of the peace conference\r\nshall have been made public, together with all material submitted to it,\r\nincluding eventual prewar bargains and treaty commitments, this\r\ndeclaration cannot be controverted. One must assume at least that the\r\nmakers of the peace believed it to be the best possible.\r\n\r\nThe _bona fides_ of the peace delegates, however, while it protects them\r\nfrom adverse criticism, is a personal matter and irrelevant in any\r\nconsideration of the treaty and its probable results. Nor is the\r\nquestion whether any better treaty was possible, of any relevancy. What\r\nalone vitally concerns the world is not the sentiments of a few men, but\r\nwhat may be expected from their work. As to this, many thoughtful\r\nobservers in all countries have already come to realize what will\r\neventually be realized by millions.\r\n\r\nThe Treaty of Versailles has Balkanized Europe; it has to a large degree\r\nreestablished the multiplicity of territorial sovereignties that\r\nhandicapped progress and caused continuous strife more than a century\r\nago; it has revived smouldering race-antagonisms which were in a fair\r\nway to be extinguished; it has created a dozen new _irredentas_, new\r\nbreeding-places of war; it has liberated thousands from foreign\r\ndomination but placed tens of thousands under the yoke of other foreign\r\ndomination, and has tried to insure the permanency not only of their\r\nsubjection, but of that of other subject races which have for centuries\r\nbeen struggling for independence. Preaching general disarmament, it has\r\nstrengthened the armed might of one power by disarming its neighbors,\r\nand has given to it the military and political domination of Europe. To\r\nanother power it has given control of the high seas. It has refused to\r\nlet the laboring masses of the world--the men who fought and\r\nsuffered--be represented at the conference by delegates of their own\r\nchoosing.\r\n\r\nSuch a treaty could not bring real peace to the world even if the\r\nconditions were less critical and complex. As they are, it will hasten\r\nand aggravate what the world will soon discover to be the most serious,\r\nvital and revolutionary consequence of the war. What this will be has\r\nalready been dimly foreshadowed by the almost unanimous condemnation of\r\nthe treaty by the Socialists of France, Italy, England and nearly all\r\nneutral countries.\r\n\r\nVirtually all Americans and even most Europeans have little conception\r\nof the extent to which the war and its two great revolutions have\r\nawakened the class-consciousness of the proletariat of all lands.\r\nEverywhere the laboring masses have been the chief sufferers. Everywhere\r\ncomposing an overwhelming majority of the people, they have nowhere been\r\nable to decide their own destinies or have an effective voice in\r\ngovernment except through revolution. Everywhere they have been the\r\npawns sacrificed on the bloody chessboard of war to protect kings and\r\nqueens, bishops and castles. They are beginning to ask why this must be\r\nand why they were not permitted to have a voice in the conference at\r\nVersailles, and this question will become an embarrassing one for all\r\nwho try to find the answer in the textbooks of governments as\r\ngovernments today exist.\r\n\r\nDeplore it though one may, Internationalism is on the march. Nor is it\r\nconfined even today to people who work with their hands. Its advocates\r\nare to be found--have been found by hundreds in America itself--in the\r\nranks of the thinkers of every country. The press in America has for\r\nmonths been pointing out the prevalence of internationalist sentiments\r\namong school-teachers and university professors, and it has been gravely\r\npuzzled by this state of affairs. It considers it a paradox that\r\nInternationalism exists among presumably well educated persons.\r\n\r\nOne might as well call it a paradox for a victim of smallpox to have an\r\neruption. It is no paradox. It is a symptom. And, incorrectly diagnosed\r\nand ignorantly treated, it is a dangerous disease.\r\n\r\nThe physician diagnoses a disease at the outset, if he can, and aborts\r\nit if possible. If it be contagious, he employs precautions against its\r\nspread. No part of these precautions consists in ordering other people\r\nat the point of a rifle not to catch the disease.\r\n\r\nThe greatest task of the governments of the world today is to diagnose\r\ncorrectly and treat intelligently. The proletarians have learned their\r\nstrength. A new era is dawning.\r\n\r\nThat era will be marked by an internationalism whose character and\r\nextent will depend upon the wisdom with which the masters of the world\r\nadminister the affairs of their peoples. And the question which every\r\nman should ask himself today is:\r\n\r\n    Shall this Internationalism be Red or White?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                        The Weimar Constitution\r\n\r\n\r\nThe provisional constitution adopted at Weimar in February, 1919, was\r\nnaturally only a makeshift. It contained but ten paragraphs, furnishing\r\nthe barest outline for the organization of the new state. Its basis was\r\na draft of a proposed constitution made by Dr. Hugo Preuss, a leading\r\nauthority on constitutional law, who had been appointed Minister of the\r\nInterior. This draft was published on January 20th. More than a hundred\r\nrepresentatives of the various German states met in the Department of\r\nthe Interior at Berlin on January 25th to consider it. This conference\r\nappointed a commission from its number, which was in session for the\r\nnext five days in Berlin and then adjourned to Weimar, where it finished\r\nthe draft of the provisional constitution.\r\n\r\nEven the short period intervening between the first publication of the\r\nPreuss draft and its submission to the National Assembly had sufficed to\r\nbring about one important and significant development. Preuss himself\r\nwas an advocate of the so-called _Einheitsstaat_, a single state on the\r\nFrench plan, divided into departments merely for administrative\r\npurposes. Many of his friends of the German Democratic Party and all\r\nSocialists also wanted to do away with the separate states, both for\r\ndoctrinal and selfish partisan reasons. Preuss realized from the\r\nbeginning the impossibility of attaining his ideal completely, but he\r\nendeavored to pave the way by a dismemberment of Prussia, the largest\r\nand dominant German state, and by doing away completely with several of\r\nthe smaller states, such as Anhalt, Oldenburg, etc. His constitutional\r\ndraft of January proposed the creation of sixteen \"territories of the\r\nstate\" (_Gebiete des Reichs_): Prussia (consisting of East Prussia, West\r\nPrussia, and Bromberg), Silesia, Brandenburg, Berlin, Lower Saxony, the\r\nthree Hansa cities (Hamburg, Bremen, Luebeck), Upper Saxony, Thuringia,\r\nWestphalia, Hesse, the Rhineland, Bavaria, Baden, Wurtemberg,\r\nGerman-Austria, and Vienna.\r\n\r\nIt became quickly apparent that Preuss and his followers had\r\nunderestimated the strength of the particularistic, localized patriotism\r\nand respect for tradition cherished by a great part of the Germans. Not\r\nonly were the South Germans aroused to opposition by the implied threat\r\nof a possible eventual onslaught on their own state boundaries, but the\r\ngreat majority of the Prussians as well protested mightily against the\r\nproposed dismemberment of Prussia. The unitarians saw themselves\r\ncompelled to yield even in the temporary constitution by inserting a\r\nprovision that \"the territory of the free states can be altered only\r\nwith their consent.\" The plan to reduce the states to mere governmental\r\ndepartments was thus already defeated.\r\n\r\nWith the erection by the National Assembly of the _Staatenausschuss_, or\r\nCommittee of the States,[67] the draft of the constitution was laid\r\nbefore that body for further consideration. On February 21st the\r\ncommittee submitted the result of its deliberations to the National\r\nAssembly, which referred it in turn to a special committee of\r\ntwenty-eight members, whose chairman was Conrad Haussmann, a member of\r\nthe German Democratic Party.\r\n\r\n[67] _Vide_ p. 245.\r\n\r\nThe National Assembly began the second reading of the constitution on\r\nJuly 2d and finished it on July 22d. The third reading began on July\r\n29th. This brought a number of important changes, one of which is of\r\ndeep significance as indicating the extent to which the members of the\r\nNational Assembly had already succeeded in freeing themselves from the\r\nhysterical mode of thinking induced by the immediate revolutionary\r\nperiod. All drafts of the constitution up to that date had provided that\r\nno member of a former reigning house in Germany should be eligible to\r\nthe Presidency. This provision was stricken out on third reading.\r\n\r\nThe constitution was finally adopted on July 31, 1919, by a vote of 262\r\nayes to 75 nayes. The negative votes were cast by the German National\r\nPeople's Party, the German People's Party, the Bavarian Peasants'\r\nLeague, and one member of the Bavarian People's Party (Dr. Heim). The\r\nconstitution was signed by President Ebert and the ministry at\r\nSchwarzburg on August 11th, and went into effect three days later. On\r\nthis date the imperial constitution of April 16, 1871, several\r\nparagraphs of which were still in effect under the provisional\r\nconstitution of February, 1919, ceased to exist.\r\n\r\nThe Weimar constitution consists of two \"main divisions.\" The first,\r\ndealing with the construction of the state, is divided into seven\r\nsections, which are subdivided into 108 articles. The second main\r\ndivision, dealing with \"fundamental rights and fundamental duties of the\r\nGermans,\" has five sections, with 57 articles.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the preambles of the old and new constitutions indicates\r\nthe different point of view from which they were approached. The\r\nconstitution of 1871 began:\r\n\r\n    \"His Majesty the King of Prussia, in the name of the North\r\n    German Federation, His Majesty the King of Bavaria, His Majesty\r\n    the King of Wurtemberg, His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of\r\n    Baden, and His Royal Highness the Grand Duke of Hesse and on the\r\n    Rhine, for those parts of the Grand Duchy of Hesse situated\r\n    south of the Main, form an everlasting federation for the\r\n    protection of the territory of the federation and of the right\r\n    prevailing within its borders, as well as for the furtherance of\r\n    the welfare of the German people.\"\r\n\r\nThe new constitution's preamble reads:\r\n\r\n    \"The German people, united in its races[68] and inspired by the\r\n    desire to renew and establish more firmly its state in freedom\r\n    and justice, to serve the ends of peace at home and abroad and\r\n    to further social progress, has given itself this constitution.\"\r\n\r\n    [68] _Das Deutsche Volk, einig in seinen Staemmen._ There is no\r\n        adequate English translation of _Staemme_ (plural of\r\n        _Stamm_), except the word \"tribes,\" which, of course, is in\r\n        place only when speaking of uncivilized peoples.\r\n\r\nArticle 1 reads:\r\n\r\n    \"The German state[69] is a republic. The power of the state\r\n    comes from the people.\"\r\n\r\n    [69] _Das Deutsche Reich ist eine Republik._ Revolutionary\r\n        though they were, the constitution-makers could not bring\r\n        themselves to discard the old name _Reich_, although it\r\n        really means empire. Hence \"state\" is an inadequate\r\n        translation, but it is also impossible to say that \"the\r\n        German Empire is a republic.\" The only solution appears to\r\n        be the adoption of the German word _Reich_--a solution\r\n        generally accepted in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary nature of the change is further emphasized in article\r\n3, which substitutes black-red-gold for the black-white-red of the old\r\nimperial flag.[70]\r\n\r\n[70] Black-white-red were retained as the colors of the\r\n    merchant-flag, but with the addition of the colors of the\r\n    Reich in the upper inner corner.\r\n\r\nOutwardly the most striking and apparent change of structure of the\r\ngovernment is, of course, the fact that a president takes the place of\r\nthe Kaiser, and that the various federated states are also required to\r\nhave a republican form of government, with legislatures chosen by the\r\ndirect, secret ballot of all male and female Germans, after the\r\nproportional election system. In fact, however, these are by no means\r\nthe most important changes. \"Republic\" is, after all, more or less a\r\nshibboleth; the actual form and representative character of governments\r\ndepend less on whether their head is a president or a hereditary monarch\r\nthan on the extent to which they make it possible for the people\r\nthemselves to make their will prevail quickly and effectively.\r\n\r\nThe changes wrought by the other seventeen articles of the first section\r\nare fundamental and sweeping. Their general nature is indicated at the\r\noutset, in article 2, which declares that \"the territory of the Reich\r\nconsists of the territories of the German lands.\" The choice of the name\r\n\"lands\" instead of states, as formerly, shows the smaller importance and\r\nlesser degree of self-government assigned to them. All the old\r\n_Reservatrechte_ or special rights reserved by several states under the\r\nmonarchy[71] are done away with. The federal government assumes the\r\nexclusive right of legislation concerning foreign relations, post,\r\ntelegraphs, and telephones, coinage, immigration and emigration, and\r\ncustoms duties.\r\n\r\n[71] _Vide_ p. 21.\r\n\r\nIt reserves to itself further the right to enact uniform civil and\r\ncriminal codes and procedure, and to legislate regarding the press,\r\nassociations, the public health, workmen and their protection,\r\nexpropriation, socialization, trade, commerce, weights and measures, the\r\nissue of paper currency, banks and bourses, mining, insurance, shipping,\r\nrailways, canals and other internal waterways, theaters and\r\ncinematographs. \"In so far as there is necessity for uniform\r\nregulations,\" the Reich may legislate concerning the public welfare and\r\nfor the protection of the public order and security.\r\n\r\nThe Reich reserves further the right to establish basic principles of\r\nlegislation affecting religious associations, schools, manufacture, real\r\nestate, burial and cremation. It can also prescribe the limits and\r\nnature of the laws of the lands (states) affecting taxation, in so far\r\nas this may be necessary to prevent a reduction of the national income\r\nor a prejudicing of the Reich in its commercial relations, double\r\ntaxation, the imposition of excessive fees which burden traffic, import\r\ntaxes against the products of other states when such taxes constitute an\r\nunfair discrimination, and export premiums.\r\n\r\nThe constitution takes from the states the power to collect customs and\r\nexcises. The federal government is empowered to exercise a direct\r\ncontrol in the various lands over all matters falling under its\r\ncompetence. Not only are all the things enumerated above, and many more,\r\nreserved to the Reich, but there is no provision conferring expressly\r\nany powers whatever on the lands. Nor is there any provision reserving\r\nto the states powers not expressly reserved to the Reich or expressly\r\nprohibited to the states. Article 12, the only provision along this\r\nline, states merely that \"so long and in so far as the Reich makes no\r\nuse of its law-giving powers, the lands retain the right of legislating.\r\nThis does not apply to legislation reserved exclusively to the Reich.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 13 provides that \"the law of the Reich takes precedence over the\r\nlaw of the lands.\" In case of a disagreement between state and federal\r\ngovernment as to whether a state law is in conflict with a federal law,\r\nan issue can be framed and placed before a federal supreme court. Preuss\r\nand some of his supporters wanted a provision expressly conferring upon\r\nthe Supreme Court at Leipsic such power to rule on the constitutionality\r\nof legislation as has been assumed by the United States Supreme Court,\r\nbut their views did not prevail.\r\n\r\nThe President of the Reich is elected by the direct vote of all Germans,\r\nmale and female, who have attained the age of twenty. The term of office\r\nis seven years, and there is no limit to the number of terms for which\r\nthe same President may be elected. Every German who has reached the age\r\nof thirty-five is eligible for the Presidency. There is no requirement\r\nthat he be a natural born citizen, nor even as to the length of time\r\nthat he must have been a citizen. A limitation of eligibility to natural\r\nborn citizens, as in the United States constitution, was considered, but\r\nwas rejected, mainly because it was expected at the time the\r\nconstitution was adopted that Austria would become a German land, and\r\nsuch a provision would have barred all living Austrians from the\r\nPresidency. There was also opposition on general principles from the\r\ninternationalists of the Left, the most extreme of whom would as soon\r\nsee a Russian or a Frenchman in the President's chair as a German.\r\n\r\nArticles 45 and 46, defining the powers of the President, take over\r\nalmost bodily articles 11 and 18 of the imperial constitution, which\r\ndefined the powers of the Kaiser. Like the Kaiser, the President\r\n\"represents the Reich internationally\"; receives and accredits\r\ndiplomatic representatives; concludes treaties with foreign powers;\r\nappoints civil servants and officers of the army and navy, and is\r\ncommander-in-chief of the country's military and naval forces. In only\r\none important respect are the President's apparent powers less than the\r\nKaiser's were: war can be declared and peace concluded only by act of\r\nthe Reichstag and Reichsrat. Under the monarchy, a declaration of war\r\nrequired only the assent of the Federal Council and even this was not\r\nrequired if the country had been actually invaded by an enemy. The\r\nPresident has no power of veto over legislation, but he can order that\r\nany law be submitted to the people by referendum before it can go into\r\neffect. He can dissolve the Reichstag at any time, as could the Kaiser,\r\nbut only once for the same reason--a limitation to which the Kaiser was\r\nnot subject. He has the general power to pardon criminals. He can, if\r\npublic safety and order be threatened, temporarily suspend most of the\r\nprovisions of the constitution regarding freedom of speech and of the\r\npress, the right of assembly, the secrecy of postal and wire\r\ncommunications, freedom of organization, security against search and\r\nseizure in one's own dwelling, etc.\r\n\r\nAll these provisions appear to confer very extensive powers upon the\r\nPresident. His appointments of diplomatic representatives do not require\r\nthe assent of a legislative body. He appoints his own Chancellor and,\r\nupon the latter's recommendation, the ministers of the various\r\ndepartments, also without requiring the assent of the legislative body.\r\nBy referring a legislative enactment to a referendum vote he exercises\r\nwhat is in effect a suspensive veto.\r\n\r\nTwo articles of the constitution, however, render all these powers more\r\nor less illusory. Article 50 provides:\r\n\r\n    \"All orders and decrees of the President, including those\r\n    affecting the country's armed forces, require for their\r\n    validity to be countersigned by the Chancellor or the\r\n    competent minister. The official who countersigns accepts\r\n    thereby the responsibility for the order or decree in\r\n    question.\"\r\n\r\nA similar provision in the American constitution would be of no\r\nimportance, for the members of the cabinet are not responsible to either\r\nthe people or the Congress for their acts. Once appointed, there is no\r\nway of getting rid of them against the will of the President, no matter\r\nhow inefficient or even harmful they may be to the best interests of the\r\ncountry. The German constitution confers much more effective power upon\r\nthe people and the people's representatives. Its article 54 provides:\r\n\r\n    \"The Chancellor and the ministers of the Reich require the\r\n    confidence of the Reichstag for the conduct of their offices.\r\n    Any one of them must resign if the Reichstag, by express\r\n    decision, withdraws its confidence from him.\"\r\n\r\nIt is readily apparent that the President's powers are greatly limited\r\nby these two articles. As against a hostile Reichstag he is all but\r\npowerless. The Chancellor or other member of the government required to\r\ncountersign orders or decrees knows in advance that such countersigning\r\nmeans his own official suicide if the matter be one in which a majority\r\nof the Reichstag is at odds with the President. It is apparent from a\r\nstudy of the proceedings of the National Assembly and its constitutional\r\ncommittee that it was intended to give the President independent powers\r\nin respect of two important matters--the dissolution of the Reichstag\r\nand the suspensive veto by appeal to the people--but article 50 says\r\nunqualifiedly that \"all\" orders and decrees must be countersigned.\r\n\r\nThe legislative functions of the Reich are vested in the Reichstag and\r\nthe Reichsrat, or Council of the Reich, which succeeds the Federal\r\nCouncil of the monarchy. The members of the Reichstag are elected by\r\ndirect vote of the people for a term of four years, after the\r\nproportional election system. The Reichstag must convene for the first\r\ntime not later than thirty days after the election, which must be held\r\non a Sunday or a public holiday, and the election for the succeeding\r\nReichstag must be held within sixty days from the date of the expiration\r\nor dissolution of the preceding one. It convenes regularly on the first\r\nWednesday of every November. The President of the Reichstag must call an\r\nextraordinary session at the demand of the President of the Reich or\r\nwhen a third of the members of the Reichstag itself demand it.\r\n\r\nAll the constitution's provisions regarding the Reichstag indicate the\r\ndetermination of the framers of the instrument to make it a thoroughly\r\nrepresentative, independent body of great dignity. The deputies are\r\nclothed with more far-reaching immunities than is the case in most\r\ncountries, and in addition to that there is a specific provision\r\nextending to them the right to refuse to reveal, even in court\r\nproceedings, any matters communicated to them in their capacity as\r\nmembers of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThere is a provision for a standing committee on foreign affairs, which\r\nmay hold sessions at any time and holds office after the expiration of\r\nthe members' terms or after dissolution of the Reichstag until the\r\nsucceeding Reichstag convenes. It is expressly provided that the\r\nsessions of this committee shall not be public unless two-thirds of the\r\nmembers vote at any particular time to hold a public session. This\r\nprovision, adopted by a body, the majority of whose members were\r\noutspoken opponents of secret diplomacy, is not without interest. It\r\nwould seem to be a tacit admission that preliminary negotiations between\r\nnations cannot always be carried on advantageously in public.\r\n\r\nThe Federal Council was, under the monarchy, the chief bulwark of the\r\nprinces, whose representatives, not the people's, its members were.[72]\r\nIn the new Reichsrat, the successor of the Federal Council, the various\r\nlands are represented \"by members of their governments.\"[73] These are\r\nthe cabinet ministers of the respective states. The Weimar constitution\r\nprovides that such ministers shall be directly responsible to the diets\r\nof their respective lands, in like manner as the members of the federal\r\ngovernment are responsible to the Reichstag. Hence, although chosen\r\nindirectly, being named, as under the imperial constitution, by their\r\nrespective state governments, they are nevertheless subject to constant,\r\neffective control by the people's representatives, who can remove them\r\nat any time by a simple vote of lack of confidence.\r\n\r\n[72] _Vide_ p. 22.\r\n\r\n[73] Weimar constitution, art. 63.\r\n\r\nEach state is entitled to send at least one representative to the\r\nReichsrat. The larger states are entitled to one representative for each\r\n700,000 inhabitants, and a remainder of at least 350,000 entitles them\r\nto one additional member. It is provided, however, that Prussia may not\r\nhave more than two-fifths of the entire number of representatives.[74]\r\nThe Reichsrat consists of sixty-six members, apportioned as follows:\r\n\r\n    Prussia, 26; Bavaria, 10; Saxony, 7; Wurtemberg, 4; Baden, 3;\r\n    Thuringia, 2; Hesse, 2; Hamburg, 2; Mecklenburg-Schwerin, 1;\r\n    Oldenburg, 1; Brunswick, 1; Anhalt, 1; Bremen, 1; Lippe, 1;\r\n    Luebeck, 1; Mecklenburg-Strelitz, 1; Waldeck, 1;\r\n    Schaumburg-Lippe, 1.\r\n\r\n[74] Original drafts of the constitution, as well as the\r\n    provisional constitution adopted in February, provided that\r\n    no state should have more than one-third of the total number.\r\n    Prussia, with four-sevenths of the total population of\r\n    Germany, successfully opposed this attempt to reduce her\r\n    representation so disproportionately. She was, however,\r\n    compelled to accept a provision that half her representatives\r\n    should be appointed by the state government and the other\r\n    half by the provincial governments. In the other lands the\r\n    state government appoints all the representatives.\r\n\r\nThe fifth section of the constitution containing articles 68 to 77\r\ninclusive, is devoted to the legislative functions of the Reich. Article\r\n68 reads:\r\n\r\n    \"Bills are proposed by the government of the Reich[75] or by the\r\n    members of the Reichstag.\r\n\r\n    [75] \"The government of the Reich\" or \"the Reich government\"\r\n        means the Chancellor and all the ministers of his cabinet.\r\n\r\n    \"The laws of the Reich are enacted by the Reichstag.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Reichsrat cannot directly propose legislative measures,\r\nhowever, it can compel the government to submit to the Reichstag\r\nmeasures drafted by it. If the government be in disagreement with the\r\nReichsrat, it must accompany its submission with a statement of its\r\nattitude toward the measure in question. The Reichsrat, while it cannot\r\ntake any positive part in enacting legislation, has the right to vote\r\ndisapproval of any measure enacted by the Reichstag, and such\r\ndisapproval acts as a suspensive veto. In such case, the measure goes\r\nback to the Reichstag. If the Reichstag reenacts it by a two-thirds\r\nmajority, the President of the Reich must duly proclaim the law within\r\nthree months or else order a popular referendum. If a smaller majority\r\nthan two-thirds again votes in favor of the measure, the President may\r\norder a referendum within three months thereafter. If he fail to do\r\nthis, the measure is lost.[76]\r\n\r\n[76] This seems to be the sole instance in which the President\r\n    possesses any real, independent power. In such a case it\r\n    would be possible for him to ally himself with the Reichsrat\r\n    against both Reichstag and government, for he cannot be\r\n    compelled to order a referendum.\r\n\r\nThe express approval by the Reichsrat of proposed legislation is not\r\nrequired for its enactment. It must express its disapproval within two\r\nweeks after an act has been passed finally by the Reichstag; if it fail\r\nto do so, the act becomes law.\r\n\r\nOne is again impressed by the importance assigned to the Reichstag, the\r\ndirect creation of the people. The national government is responsible to\r\nit, as is also the President through the provision that all his decrees\r\nmust be countersigned by a member of the government. A two-thirds\r\nmajority of the Reichstag can overrule the Reichsrat, and the same\r\nnumber can impeach the President or any member of the government, or\r\neven submit directly to the people the question as to whether the\r\nPresident shall be recalled. Its decision to hold such a referendum\r\nautomatically inhibits the President from exercising any of the\r\nfunctions of his office.\r\n\r\nIt is the people themselves, however, to whom the supreme power is\r\ngiven, or, perhaps better expressed, who have reserved the supreme power\r\nfor themselves by extensive provisions for referendum and initiative. In\r\naddition to the provisions for referendum already referred to, the\r\nPresident can decree, within one month after its passage, that any law\r\nenacted by the Reichstag shall be referred to the people.\r\n\r\nThe law-giving powers delegated to the Reichstag can also be exercised\r\ndirectly by the people. One-twentieth of the registered voters can\r\nrequire that a referendum be held on any Reichstag enactment against\r\nwhose formal proclamation as law at least one-third of the Reichstag\r\nmembers shall have protested. One-tenth of the registered voters can\r\npresent the draft of a legislative measure and demand that it be\r\nreferred to a general election. The Reichstag can prevent the holding of\r\nsuch a referendum only by adopting the proposed measure unchanged.\r\nEnactments of the Reichstag can be declared invalid by referendum only\r\nby the vote of a majority of a majority of all registered voters. Only\r\nthe President can order that a referendum be held on the national\r\nbudgets, customs and taxation, and salaries of officials and civil\r\nservants. No initiative is possible as to these things.\r\n\r\nThe people's initiative was one of the various concessions to the\r\nSocialists of which more will be said later. It was not contemplated by\r\nthe framers of the original drafts of the constitution and was\r\nintroduced at a late period in the deliberations.\r\n\r\nThe provisions regulating the amendment of the constitution are more\r\ndefinite than those of the United States constitution, and they also\r\nmake it possible for the voters to make their will known by the\r\ndemocratic method of the direct ballot.[77] Amendments originating with\r\nthe Reichstag or government may be adopted by the same procedure as is\r\nprescribed for ordinary legislative measures, except that two-thirds of\r\ntwo-thirds of all members, i.e., four-ninths of the whole house, must\r\nvote for them.[78] A tenth of the registered voters of the country may\r\npresent a draft of a proposed amendment, as is provided for ordinary\r\nbills, and this amendment must be referred to a vote of the people\r\nunless the Reichstag adopt it unchanged. For the adoption of an\r\namendment by referendum the affirmative vote of a majority of the\r\nregistered voters is required.[79]\r\n\r\n[77] The United States Supreme Court has decided that the\r\n    constitutional requirement of a vote of \"two-thirds of both\r\n    houses\" (art. v) for amendments does not mean two-thirds of\r\n    both houses, but merely two-thirds of a quorum of both\r\n    houses. It has further decided that the people of the various\r\n    states have no right to vote directly upon constitutional\r\n    amendments; they are confined to indirect representation\r\n    through their legislatures.\r\n\r\n[78] Every European people regards its constitution merely as a\r\n    fundamental law, and ascribes no sacrosanct character to it.\r\n    Hence the departure from the American requirement of an\r\n    affirmative vote of three-fourths of the states. On the other\r\n    hand, the framers of the Weimar constitution, by providing\r\n    for a direct vote of the people, rendered it impossible for\r\n    an aggressive and unscrupulous minority to force through an\r\n    amendment against the wishes of a majority of the people.\r\n\r\n[79] The question of the return of the monarchy in some form is\r\n    and will be for some years chiefly of academic interest, but\r\n    it will be noted that, from a purely juristic viewpoint, a\r\n    monarchy can be re-established at any time by a bare majority\r\n    of all German men and women twenty years of age or over, and\r\n    that one-tenth of the voters, or somewhat less than four\r\n    millions, could at any time force a vote on the question.\r\n\r\nSeven articles deal with the judicial department of the government. They\r\nmake no important changes from the old constitution, except that\r\ncourts-martial are forbidden except in time of war or aboard warships.\r\nAn attempt by the parties of the Left to do away with state courts and\r\nplace the dispensing of justice solely in the hands of the federal\r\ncourts failed.\r\n\r\nThe second \"main division\" of the constitution deals with the\r\n\"fundamental rights and fundamental duties of the Germans.\" Excluding\r\nfifteen \"transitional and concluding decrees,\" the constitution contains\r\n165 articles. No less than 56 of these, or more than one-third, are\r\ndevoted to sections bearing the following titles:\r\n\r\n    The individual; social life; religion and religious societies;\r\n    education and school; economic life.\r\n\r\nThe first ten articles, dealing with the individual, begin by declaring\r\nthe equality of all Germans before the law. All titles of nobility are\r\nabolished, but they may be borne hereafter as parts of a name. Orders\r\nand decorations may not be conferred by the state, and \"no German may\r\naccept titles or orders from a foreign government.\"[80] That part of the\r\nBill of Rights contained in amendments i, iv, vi, and xiv of the\r\nAmerican constitution is taken over in effect, but with much enlargement\r\nof the rights of the individual. Thus, to the provision for freedom of\r\nspeech and the press is added the declaration that \"no employment or\r\nsalaried relation shall deprive any person of this right, and no person\r\nmay prejudice him for making use of this right.\" Later, in the articles\r\ndealing with economic life, it is further provided:\r\n\r\n[80] This goes even farther than the American constitution, which\r\n    provides merely that \"no person holding any office of profit\r\n    or trust\" under the federal government shall, without the\r\n    consent of Congress, accept any present or title from a\r\n    foreign power. (Art. I, sect. 9, par. 8.)\r\n\r\n    \"Freedom to associate for the protection and furthering of labor\r\n    and economic conditions is guaranteed to every person and for\r\n    all callings. All agreements and measures which endeavor to\r\n    restrict or prevent the exercise of this freedom are\r\n    illegal.[81]\r\n\r\n    [81] Under this provision workmen cannot be required to sign\r\n        contracts binding them not to join labor-unions, nor can\r\n        employers contract with each other not to hire members of\r\n        such unions.\r\n\r\nA right to the protection of the Reich as against foreign countries is\r\nexpressly granted \"to all nationals of the Reich both within and without\r\nthe territory of the Reich.\"[82] Nor may any German be delivered up to a\r\nforeign nation for prosecution or punishment. It is expressly provided\r\nthat men and women \"have, in principle, the same rights and duties.\" The\r\nright to assemble peaceably without previous notification or permission\r\nis granted--a flat contrast to the situation under the monarchy--but the\r\nReichstag is empowered to enact a law requiring previous notification of\r\nsuch assemblages if they are to be held outdoors, and may prohibit them\r\nin case the public safety be threatened.\r\n\r\n[82] This, too, is a departure from the American model. An\r\n    American citizen has no constitutional right to the\r\n    protection of his government while he is without the country.\r\n\r\nUp to this point the Weimar constitution does not present any marked\r\nevidence of the circumstances under which it came into being. In\r\ncomparison with the imperial constitution it may fairly be regarded as\r\nrevolutionary, but considered by itself it is merely an advancedly\r\ndemocratic instrument with provisions insuring thoroughly parliamentary\r\ngovernment in the best sense of the word. It is not until one reaches\r\nthe articles dealing with social and economic life, the church and the\r\nschool that the traces of Socialist influence become unmistakable.\r\nThere, however, they are found on every page, beginning with the\r\ndeclaration that \"motherhood has a right to the protection and care of\r\nthe state,\" followed by an article providing that \"illegitimate children\r\nare to be granted by legislation the same conditions for their bodily,\r\nmental and social development as are granted to legitimate children.\"\r\n\r\nEssentially, of course, neither provision is especially Socialistic, but\r\nboth really represent a compromise with the parties of the Left. The\r\nMajority Socialists tried to have an article inserted giving to\r\nillegitimate children full rights of inheritance with legitimate\r\nchildren of their father's estate, and the right to bear his name. The\r\nmotion was defeated, 167 to 129 votes. The Independent Socialists wanted\r\na provision protecting women civil servants who become mothers of\r\nillegitimate children, and granting them the right to be addressed as\r\n_Frau_ (Mrs.) instead of _Fraeulein_ (Miss). This, too, was defeated.\r\n\r\nOther articles due to Socialist advocacy, some of a principal nature,\r\nothers merely doctrinaire, are:\r\n\r\n    Providing that legal rights may not be refused to any\r\n    association because it has a political, politico-social or\r\n    religious aim;\r\n\r\n    Providing that \"no person is obliged to state his religious\r\n    belief\";\r\n\r\n    Disestablishing the state church;\r\n\r\n    Providing for secular (non-religious) schools, freeing teachers\r\n    from the duty to give religious instruction, and permitting\r\n    parents or guardians to free their children from religious\r\n    instruction;\r\n\r\n    Providing that \"the cultivation and use of land is a duty which\r\n    the owner owes to the community.[83] Increase in value of the\r\n    land which is not due to labor or the investment of capital in\r\n    it is to be utilized for the good of the people\";\r\n\r\n    [83] This is an interesting novelty as to real estate, but\r\n        the principle is by no means new, being well established in\r\n        patent law. Failure to exploit a patent right may lead to\r\n        its loss.\r\n\r\n    \"Property imposes obligations. Its enjoyment shall be at the\r\n    same time a service for the common weal\";\r\n\r\n    Directing the dissolution of entailed estates;\r\n\r\n    Declaring that civil servants \"are servants of the whole people,\r\n    not of a party.\"\r\n\r\nThe anti-Christian and anti-religious sentiments of the Socialists did\r\nnot find as complete expression in the constitution as those parties had\r\ndesired. The church is disestablished, but it retains the right to tax\r\nits members and have legal process for the collection of the taxes. The\r\nproperty of the church is left untouched. Subsidies formerly paid from\r\npublic funds are discontinued. Sunday is protected as \"a day of rest and\r\nspiritual elevation.\" Religious bodies may hold services in hospitals,\r\nprisons, army barracks, etc., \"in so far as need for divine services and\r\nministerial offices exists,\" but no person can be compelled to attend.\r\n\r\nAll these provisions are, of course, of comparatively minor\r\nimportance--except that dissolving the entailed estates--and many are\r\nmere doctrinarianism, but the final section of the constitution, dealing\r\nwith economic affairs, brings principles which, if the combined\r\nSocialist parties should ever succeed in getting a bare majority of the\r\ncountry's voters under their banner, would make possible far-reaching\r\nchanges along Marxian lines. Article 153 reads:\r\n\r\n    \"Property can be expropriated only for the common welfare and by\r\n    legal methods. Expropriation is to be made upon just\r\n    compensation, _so far as a law of the Reich does not prescribe\r\n    otherwise_.\" (Italics by the author.)\r\n\r\nArticle 156 reads:\r\n\r\n    \"The Reich can, by law, without prejudice to the question of\r\n    compensation, with due employment of the regulations governing\r\n    expropriations, transfer to the ownership of the people private\r\n    economic undertakings which are adapted for socialization. It\r\n    can itself participate, or cause the lands or municipalities to\r\n    participate, in the administration of economic undertakings and\r\n    associations, or can in other manner secure to itself a deciding\r\n    influence therein.\r\n\r\n    \"The Reich can also, in case of urgent necessity and in the\r\n    interests of the public, consolidate by law economic\r\n    undertakings and associations on the basis of\r\n    self-administration, for the purpose of securing the cooperation\r\n    of all creative factors of the people, employers and employees,\r\n    in the administration, and of regulating production,\r\n    manufacture, distribution, utilization and prices, as well as\r\n    import and export, of the economic properties upon principles\r\n    serving the interests of the people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Labor enjoys the especial protection of the Reich.\" gained by the\r\nrevolutionary parties in framing the constitution. They not only make\r\nsweeping socialization possible, in the event of the Socialists coming\r\ninto power, but also, as the italicized sentence in article 153\r\nindicates, socialization without compensation to the former private\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nThere are still two Socialistic articles to be considered. One, article\r\n157, says:\r\n\r\n    \"Labor enjoys the especial protection of the Reich.\"\r\n\r\n_Die Arbeitskraft_, translated above by labor, means the whole body of\r\nworkmen. The provision is another bit of doctrinarianism without any\r\nparticular value, but it is nevertheless at variance with the\r\nequal-rights-to-all and all-Germans-equal-before-the-law spirit that is\r\nso carefully emphasized elsewhere in the constitution. The other article\r\ncalling for particular mention is No. 165, the last article of the\r\nconstitution proper. This is a direct heritage of November, 1918.\r\n\r\nFrom the very outset, as has been pointed out repeatedly in this work,\r\nthe Spartacans were determined to impose the soviet form of government\r\nupon Germany. Later on the Independent Socialists also threw off their\r\nparliamentary mask and joined in the demand for the _Raeterepublik_ on\r\nthe Bolshevist model. There were some leaders of the Majority Socialist\r\nParty who were willing to consider a combination of parliamentarism and\r\nsovietism, but most of the older leaders, including Ebert, had no\r\nsympathy with the idea. They were Socialists, but also democrats. When\r\nit began to become apparent to the advocates of the soviet system that\r\nthey were in the minority, they raised a demand that the workmen's\r\ncouncil should be \"anchored\" in the constitution. The framers of that\r\ndocument did not take the demand seriously, and the draft prepared for\r\npresentation to the National Assembly after the adoption of the\r\nprovisional constitution made no reference to the councils.\r\n\r\nThe extremer Socialists, however, renewed their original demand, and\r\neven the more conservative leaders of the parent party, much against\r\ntheir will, saw themselves compelled for partisan political reasons to\r\nsupport the demand. The result was article 165, inserted in the draft in\r\nJune.\r\n\r\nThis article begins by declaring that workmen and other wage-earners\r\nhave equal rights with their employers in determining wage and working\r\nconditions and in cooperating \"in the entire economic development of\r\nproductive powers.\" It provides that they shall, for the protection of\r\ntheir social and economic interests, have the right to be represented\r\nthrough workmen's shop councils (_Betriebsarbeiterraete_), as well as in\r\ndistrict workmen's councils (_Bezirksarbeiterraete_), and in a national\r\nworkmen's council (_Reichsarbeiterrat_). The district and national\r\ncouncils combine with the representatives of the employers \"and other\r\ninterested circles of the people\" to form district economic councils\r\n(_Bezirkswirtschaftsraete_), and a national economic council\r\n(_Reichswirtschaftsrat_). \"The district economic councils and the\r\nnational economic council are to be so constituted that all important\r\ngroups of interests are represented in proportion to their economic and\r\nsocial importance.\"\r\n\r\nArticle 165 continues:\r\n\r\n    \"Politico-social and politico-economic bills of fundamental\r\n    importance shall, before their introduction, be laid by the\r\n    government of the Reich before the national economic council for\r\n    its consideration and report. The national economic council has\r\n    the right to propose such bills itself. If the government does\r\n    not approve of them, it must nevertheless lay them before the\r\n    Reichstag, together with a statement of its attitude. The\r\n    national economic council is empowered to have the bill\r\n    advocated before the Reichstag by one of its members.\r\n\r\n    \"Powers of control and administration can be conferred upon the\r\n    workmen's and economic councils over matters lying in their\r\n    sphere of action.\"\r\n\r\nThus the \"anchor\" of the workmen's councils in the German constitution.\r\nIt is difficult to find in it the importance assigned to it by the\r\nSocialists. The national council has, in the last analysis, only such\r\npower as the Reichstag may choose to confer upon it. There was no sharp\r\nopposition to the article from the _bourgeois_ parties, doubtless due in\r\nlarge part to the fact that, even long before the revolution, the right\r\nof workmen to combine and negotiate as organizations with their\r\nemployers was recognized by everybody, and that Germany, with less than\r\ntwo-thirds of the population of the United States, has roundly three\r\ntimes as many organized workmen. In the circumstance, article 165 did\r\nnot bring any really revolutionary change.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a brief outline of the more important features of the\r\nconstitution of the German Republic. Considering all the attendant\r\ncircumstances of its birth--the apathy of the people, the weakness of\r\nthe government, the disruption of the Germans into factions which\r\nbitterly hated and opposed each other, the savage conditions of the\r\npeace, following the crushing conditions of the armistice, the\r\ndisappearance from the political field of most of the trained minds of\r\nthe old empire, the strength of the elements inspired by purely\r\nmaterialistic and egoistic aims or by a naive trust in the\r\ninternationalists of other lands, the constant pressure from the\r\nenemy--the framers and proponents of the constitution accomplished a\r\nnational deed of dignity and worth. They might easily have done much\r\nworse; it is impossible for one who watched the developments of those\r\ntrying days to assert that they could have done much better.\r\n\r\n    (The author's acknowledgments are due as to this chapter to Dr.\r\n    Hugo Preuss, for valuable information as to the course of the\r\n    deliberations of the various constitutional commissions and\r\n    for interpretations of the constitution, and to Dr. Fremont\r\n    A. Higgins, A.M., LL.B. (Columbia), J.U.D. (University of\r\n    Kiel), who generously gave the benefit of his wide knowledge\r\n    of German law and bibliography.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    _Through the courtesy of the World Peace Foundation the Yale\r\n    University Press is enabled to reprint \"The Constitution of the\r\n    German Commonwealth\" as it appeared in the_ League of Nations\r\n    _for December, 1919. The following note on \"The Terminology\r\n    of the Constitution\" by the translators, William Bennett\r\n    Munro and Arthur Norman Holcombe, appeared in the introduction\r\n    to the translation_:\r\n\r\n\r\nA word should be added in explanation of the way in which certain\r\ntechnical terms have been translated.\r\n\r\nIt is no longer fitting, for example, to translate _Reich_ as empire.\r\nYet it is not clear to what extent the old spirit as well as the old\r\nforms have changed. Certainly the \"strange trappings and primitive\r\nauthority\" of the imperial government are gone. How far has the spirit\r\nas well as the form of government of, by, and for the People taken its\r\nplace? It is too soon to say. Whatever the event may be, it seems best\r\nfor Americans at this time to substitute for empire the less specialized\r\nexpression, commonwealth.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty arises when _Reichs_- is used as a qualifier. Is the\r\n_Reichsrat_, for example, a federal council or a national council? This\r\nraises a fundamental question concerning the effect of the Revolution.\r\nIs the German Commonwealth a unified state or does it remain a\r\nconfederation? Apparently the former federal States have not yet\r\nsurrendered all their sovereign powers. The residue of sovereignty left\r\nto the States, however, is slight and unsubstantial. Recently, indeed\r\n(December, 1919), the Assembly of the principal State, Prussia, is\r\nreported to have adopted a resolution in favor of further\r\ncentralization. As the Constitution stands, the Commonwealth appears to\r\nbe a federation in which the rights of the States are subordinated to\r\nthose of the Union to a far greater extent than in our own United\r\nStates. It has seemed proper, therefore, to use the term \"national\"\r\nrather than \"federal.\"\r\n\r\nThe term _Reichsregierung_ might be translated National Government, or\r\nAdministration, or Cabinet. We have adopted the term Cabinet because of\r\nits greater precision. Both the other expressions have a more general as\r\nwell as a specialized meaning and would ordinarily be understood by\r\nAmericans to include the President as well as the Chancellor and\r\nMinisters, who alone are the members of the Cabinet in the strict sense\r\nof the term. The _Regierung_ must be distinguished from the\r\n_Ministerium_. The latter term may designate either the whole body of\r\nministers or the department of any one minister. In the text of the\r\nGerman Constitution it is used only in the latter sense.\r\n\r\nThe translations adopted for the principal political terms of the new\r\nConstitution are indicated in the glossary. In general the purpose has\r\nbeen to adhere as closely to a literal rendering of the German as was\r\ncompatible with an intelligible English version. Preference has been\r\ngiven throughout the translation to the terminology of republican\r\ngovernment as developed in the United States. For a correct\r\nunderstanding of a foreign constitution, no translation can however\r\nsuffice; the original text with a commentary must be carefully studied\r\nby anyone who wishes to obtain a thorough comprehension of such a\r\ndocument.\r\n\r\nThe translators are glad to acknowledge their indebtedness to Professor\r\nJohn A. Walz and Dr. F. W. C. Lieder of the Department of German in\r\nHarvard University, and to Dean Roscoe Pound of the Harvard Law School\r\nfor careful scrutiny of the proofs and many helpful suggestions on\r\ndifficult passages.\r\n\r\n                                                            W.
