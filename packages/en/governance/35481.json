WISE.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:\r\n\r\nI dedicate this work to you, because I am acquainted with no one who has\r\nso zealously, laboriously and successfully endeavored to Virginianise\r\nVirginia, by encouraging, through State legislation, her intellectual\r\nand physical growth and development; no one who has seen so clearly the\r\nevils of centralization from without, and worked so earnestly to cure or\r\navert those evils, by building up centralization within.\r\n\r\nVirginia should have her centres of Thought at her Colleges and her\r\nUniversity, centres of Trade and Manufactures at her Seaboard and\r\nWestern towns, and centres of Fashion at her Mineral Springs.\r\n\r\nI agree with you, too, that State strength and State independence are\r\nthe best guarantees of State rights; and that policy the wisest which\r\nmost promotes the growth of State strength and independence.\r\n\r\nWeakness invites aggression; strength commands respect; hence, the Union\r\nis safest when its separate members are best able to repel injury, or to\r\nlive independently.\r\n\r\nYour attachment to Virginia has not lessened your love for the Union. In\r\nurging forward to completion such works as the Covington and Ohio Road,\r\nyou are trying to add to the wealth, the glory and the strength of our\r\nown State, whilst you would add equally to the wealth, the strength and\r\nperpetuity of the Union.\r\n\r\nI cannot commit you to all the doctrines of my book, for you will not\r\nsee it until it is published.\r\n\r\n  With very great respect,\r\n\r\n                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                      GEO. FITZHUGH.\r\n\r\n_Port Royal, Aug. 22, 1856._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have endeavored, in this work, to treat the subjects of Liberty and\r\nSlavery in a more rigidly analytical manner than in \"Sociology for the\r\nSouth;\" and, at the same time, to furnish the reader with abundance of\r\nfacts, authorities and admissions, whereby to test the truth of my\r\nviews.\r\n\r\nMy chief aim has been to shew, that _Labor makes values, and Wit\r\nexploitates and accumulates them_; and hence to deduce the conclusion\r\nthat the unrestricted exploitation of so-called free society, is more\r\noppressive to the laborer than domestic slavery.\r\n\r\nIn making a distinct onslaught on the popular doctrines of Modern\r\nEthics, I must share the credit or censure with my corresponding\r\nacquaintance and friend, Professor H. of Virginia.\r\n\r\nOur acquaintance commenced by his congratulating me, by letter, on the\r\nannouncement that I was occupied with a treatise vindicating the\r\ninstitution of Slavery in the abstract, and by his suggestion, that he\r\nforesaw, from what he had read of my communications to the papers, that\r\nI should be compelled to make a general assault on the prevalent\r\npolitical and moral philosophy. This letter, and others subsequent to\r\nit, together with the reception of my Book by the Southern Public, have\r\ninduced me in the present work to avow the full breadth and scope of my\r\npurpose. I am sure it will be easier to convince the world that the\r\ncustomary theories of our Modern Ethical Philosophy, whether utilitarian\r\nor sentimental, are so fallacious or so false in their premises and\r\ntheir deductions as to deserve rejection, than to persuade it that the\r\nsocial forms under which it lives, and attempts to justify and approve,\r\nare equally erroneous, and should be re-placed by others founded on a\r\nbroader philosophical system and more Christian principles.\r\n\r\nYet, I believe that, under the banners of Socialism and more dangerous,\r\nbecause more delusive, Semi-Socialism, society is insensibly, and often\r\nunconsciously, marching to the utter abandonment of the most essential\r\ninstitutions--religion, family ties, property, and the restraints of\r\njustice. The present profession is, indeed, to stop at the half-way\r\nhouse of No-Government and Free Love; but we are sure that it cannot\r\nhalt and encamp in such quarters. Society will work out erroneous\r\ndoctrines to their logical consequences, and detect error only by the\r\nexperience of mischief. The world will only fall back on domestic\r\nslavery when all other social forms have failed and been exhausted. That\r\nhour may not be far off.\r\n\r\nMr. H. will not see this work before its publication, and would dissent\r\nfrom many of its details, from the unrestricted latitude of its\r\npositions, and from its want of precise definition. The time has not yet\r\narrived, in my opinion, for such precision, nor will it arrive until the\r\npresent philosophy is seen to be untenable, and we begin to look about\r\nus for a loftier and more enlightened substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our little work, \"Sociology for the South,\" we said, \"We may again\r\nappear in the character of writer before the public; but we shall not\r\nintrude, and would prefer that others should finish the work which we\r\nhave begun.\" That little work has met, every where, we believe, at the\r\nSouth, with a favorable reception. No one has denied its theory of Free\r\nSociety, nor disputed the facts on which that theory rests. Very many\r\nable co-laborers have arisen, and many books and essays are daily\r\nappearing, taking higher ground in defence of Slavery; justifying it as\r\na normal and natural institution, instead of excusing or apologizing for\r\nit, as an exceptional one. It is now treated as a positive good, not a\r\nnecessary evil. The success, not the ability of our essay, may have had\r\nsome influence in eliciting this new mode of defence. We have, for many\r\nyears, been gradually and cautiously testing public opinion at the\r\nSouth, and have ascertained that it is ready to approve, and much\r\nprefers, the highest ground of defence. We have no peculiar fitness for\r\nthe work we are engaged in, except the confidence that we address a\r\npublic predisposed to approve our doctrines, however bold or novel.\r\nHeretofore the great difficulty in defending Slavery has arisen from the\r\nfear that the public would take offence at assaults on its\r\nlong-cherished political axioms; which, nevertheless, stood in the way\r\nof that defence. It is now evident that those axioms have outlived their\r\nday--for no one, either North or South, has complained of our rather\r\nferocious assault on them--much less attempted to reply to or refute our\r\narguments and objections. All men begin very clearly to perceive, that\r\nthe state of revolution is politically and socially abnormal and\r\nexceptional, and that the principles that would justify it are true in\r\nthe particular, false in the general. \"A recurrence to fundamental\r\nprinciples,\" by an oppressed people, is treason if it fails; the noblest\r\nof heroism if it eventuates in successful revolution. But a \"frequent\r\nrecurrence to fundamental principles\" is at war with the continued\r\nexistence of all government, and is a doctrine fit to be sported only by\r\nthe Isms of the North and the Red Republicans of Europe. With them no\r\nprinciples are considered established and sacred, nor will ever be.\r\nWhen, in time of revolution, society is partially disbanded,\r\ndisintegrated and dissolved, the doctrine of Human Equality may have a\r\nhearing, and may be useful in stimulating rebellion; but it is\r\npractically impossible, and directly conflicts with all government, all\r\nseparate property, and all social existence. We cite these two examples,\r\nas instances, to shew how the wisest and best of men are sure to deduce,\r\nas general principles, what is only true as to themselves and their\r\npeculiar circumstances. Never were people blessed with such wise and\r\nnoble Institutions as we; for they combine most that was good in those\r\nof Rome and Greece, of Judea, and of Mediaeval England. But the\r\nmischievous absurdity of our political axioms and principles quite\r\nequals the wisdom and conservatism of our political practices. The ready\r\nappreciation by the public of such doctrines as these, encourages us to\r\npersevere in writing. The silence of the North is far more encouraging,\r\nhowever, than the approbation of the South. Piqued and taunted for two\r\nyears, by many Southern Presses of high standing, to deny the\r\nproposition that Free Society in Western Europe is a failure, and that\r\nit betrays premonitory symptoms of failure, even in America, the North\r\nis silent, and thus tacitly admits the charge. Challenged to compare and\r\nweigh the advantages and disadvantages of our domestic slavery with\r\ntheir slavery of the masses to capital and skill, it is mute, and\r\nneither accepts nor declines our challenge. The comparative evils of\r\nSlave Society and of Free Society, of slavery to human Masters and of\r\nslavery to Capital, are the issues which the South now presents, and\r\nwhich the North avoids. And she avoids them, because the Abolitionists,\r\nthe only assailants of Southern Slavery, have, we believe, to a man,\r\nasserted the entire failure of their own social system, proposed its\r\nsubversion, and suggested an approximating millenium, or some system of\r\nFree Love, Communism, or Socialism, as a substitute.\r\n\r\nThe alarming extent of this state of public opinion, or, to speak more\r\naccurately, the absence of any public opinion, or common faith and\r\nconviction about anything, is not dreamed of at the South, nor fully and\r\nproperly realized, even at the North. _We_ cannot believe what is so\r\nentirely different from all our experience and observation, and _they_\r\nhave become familiarized and inattentive to the infected social\r\natmosphere they continually inhale. Besides, living in the midst of the\r\nisms, their situation is not favorable for comprehensive observation or\r\ncalm generalization. More than a year since, we made a short trip to the\r\nNorth, and whilst there only associated with distinguished\r\nAbolitionists. We have corresponded much with them, before and since,\r\nand read many of their books, lectures, essays and speeches. We have\r\nneither seen nor heard any denial by them of the failure of their own\r\nsocial system; but, in the contrary, found that they all concurred in\r\nthe necessity of radical social changes. 'Tis true, in conversation,\r\nthey will say, \"Our system of society is bad, but yours of the South is\r\nworse; the cause of social science is advancing, and we are ready to\r\ninstitute a system better than either.\" We could give many private\r\nanecdotes, and quote thousands of authorities, to prove that such is the\r\nexact state of opinion with the multitudinous isms of the North. The\r\ncorrectness of our statement will not be denied. If it is, any one may\r\nsatisfy himself of its truth by reading any Abolition or Infidel paper\r\nat the North for a single month. The Liberator, of Boston, their ablest\r\npaper, gives continually the fullest expose of their opinions, and of\r\ntheir wholesale destructiveness of purpose.\r\n\r\nThe neglect of the North to take issue with us, or with the Southern\r\nPress, in the new positions which we have assumed, our own observations\r\nof the working of Northern society, the alarming increase of Socialism,\r\nas evinced by its control of many Northern State Legislatures, and its\r\nmajority in the lower house of Congress, are all new proofs of the truth\r\nof our doctrine. The character of that majority in Congress is displayed\r\nin full relief, by the single fact, which we saw stated in a Northern\r\nAbolition paper, that \"there are a hundred Spiritual Rappers in\r\nCongress.\" A Northern member of Congress made a similar remark to us a\r\nfew days since. 'Tis but a copy of the Hiss Legislature of\r\nMassachusetts, or the Praise-God-Barebones Parliament of England.\r\nFurther study, too, of Western European Society, which has been engaged\r\nin continual revolution for twenty years, has satisfied us that Free\r\nSociety every where begets isms, and that isms soon beget bloody\r\nrevolutions. Until our trip to the North, we did not justly appreciate\r\nthe passage which we are about to quote from Mr. Carlyle's \"Latter-Day\r\nPamphlets.\" Now it seems to us as if Boston, New Haven, or Western New\r\nYork, had set for the picture:\r\n\r\n    \"To rectify the relation that exists between two men, is there no\r\n    method, then, but that of ending it? The old relation has become\r\n    unsuitable, obsolete, perhaps unjust; and the remedy is, abolish\r\n    it; let there henceforth be no relation at all. From the\r\n    'sacrament of marriage' downwards, human beings used to be\r\n    manifoldly related one to another, and each to all; and there was\r\n    no relation among human beings, just or unjust, that had not its\r\n    grievances and its difficulties, its necessities on both sides to\r\n    bear and forbear. But henceforth, be it known, we have changed all\r\n    that by favor of Heaven; the 'voluntary principle' has come up,\r\n    which will itself do the business for us; and now let a new\r\n    sacrament, that of _Divorce_, which we call emancipation, and\r\n    spout of on our platforms, be universally the order of the day!\r\n    Have men considered whither all this is tending, and what it\r\n    certainly enough betokens? Cut every human relation that has any\r\n    where grown uneasy sheer asunder; reduce whatsoever was compulsory\r\n    to voluntary, whatsoever was permanent among us to the condition\r\n    of the nomadic; in other words, LOOSEN BY ASSIDUOUS WEDGES, in\r\n    every joint, the whole fabrice of social existence, stone from\r\n    stone, till at last, all lie now quite loose enough, it can, as we\r\n    already see in most countries, be overset by sudden outburst of\r\n    revolutionary rage; and lying as mere mountains of anarchic\r\n    rubbish, solicit you to sing Fraternity, &c. over it, and rejoice\r\n    in the now remarkable era of human progress we have arrived at.\"\r\n\r\nNow we plant ourselves on this passage from Carlyle. We say that, as far\r\nas it goes, 'tis a faithful picture of the isms of the North. But the\r\nrestraints of Law and Public Opinion are less at the North than in\r\nEurope. The isms on each side the Atlantic are equally busy with\r\n\"assiduous wedges,\" in \"loosening in every joint the whole fabric of\r\nsocial existence;\" but whilst they dare invoke Anarchy in Europe, they\r\ndare not inaugurate New York Free Love, and Oneida Incest, and Mormon\r\nPolygamy. The moral, religious, and social heresies of the North, are\r\nmore monstrous than those of Europe. The pupil has surpassed the master,\r\nunaided by the stimulants of poverty, hunger and nakedness, which urge\r\nthe master forward.\r\n\r\nSociety need not fail in the North-east until the whole West is settled,\r\nand a refluent population, or excess of immigration, overstocks\r\npermanently the labor market on the Atlantic board. Till then, the\r\ndespotism of skill and capital, in forcing emigration to the West, makes\r\nproprietors of those emigrants, benefits them, peoples the West, and by\r\ntheir return trade, enriches the East. The social forms of the North and\r\nthe South are, for the present, equally promotive of growth and\r\nprosperity at home, and equally beneficial to mankind at large, by\r\naffording asylums to the oppressed, and by furnishing food and clothing\r\nto all. Northern society is a partial failure, but only because it\r\ngenerates isms which threaten it with overthrow and impede its progress.\r\n\r\nDespite of appearing vain and egotistical, we cannot refrain from\r\nmentioning another circumstance that encourages us to write. At the very\r\ntime when we were writing our pamphlet entitled \"Slavery Justified,\" in\r\nwhich we took ground that Free Society had failed, Mr. Carlyle began to\r\nwrite his \"_Latter Day_ Pamphlets,\" whose very title is the assertion of\r\nthe failure of Free Society. The proof derived from this coincidence\r\nbecomes the stronger, when it is perceived that an ordinary man on this\r\nside the Atlantic discovered and was exposing the same social phenomena\r\nthat an extraordinary one had discovered and was exposing on the other.\r\nThe very titles of our works are synonymous--for the \"Latter Day\" is the\r\n\"Failure of Society.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Carlyle, and Miss Fanny Wright (in her England the Civilizer)\r\nvindicate Slavery by shewing that each of its apparent relaxations in\r\nEngland has injured the laboring class. They were fully and ably\r\nrepresented in Parliament by their ancient masters, the Barons. Since\r\nthe Throne, and the Church, and the Nobility, have been stripped of\r\ntheir power, and a House of Commons, representing lands and money, rules\r\ndespotically, the masses have become outlawed. They labor under all the\r\ndisadvantages of slavery, and have none of the rights of slaves. This is\r\nthe true history of the English Constitution, and one which we intend,\r\nin the sequel, more fully to expound. This presents another reason why\r\nwe again appear before the public. Blackstone, which is read by most\r\nAmerican gentlemen, teaches a doctrine the exact reverse of this, and\r\nthat doctrine we shall try to refute.\r\n\r\nReturning from the North, we procured in New York a copy of Aristotle's\r\n\"Politics and Economics.\" To our surprise, we found that our theory of\r\nthe origin of society was identical with his, and that we had employed\r\nnot only the same illustrations, but the very same words. We saw at once\r\nthat the true vindication of slavery must be founded on his theory of\r\nman's social nature, as opposed to Locke's theory of the Social\r\nContract, on which latter Free Society rests for support. 'Tis true we\r\nhad broached this doctrine; but with the world at large our authority\r\nwas merely repulsive, whilst the same doctrine, coming from Aristotle,\r\nhad, besides his name, two thousand years of human approval and\r\nconcurrence in its favor; for, without that concurrence and approval,\r\nhis book would have long since perished.\r\n\r\nIn addition to all this, we think we have discovered that Moses has\r\nanticipated the Socialists, and that in prohibiting \"usury of money, and\r\nof victuals, and of all things that are lent on usury,\" and in\r\ndenouncing \"increase\" he was far wiser than Aristotle, and saw that\r\nother capital or property did not \"breed\" any more than money, and that\r\nits profits were unjust exactions levied from the laboring man. The\r\nSocialists proclaim this as a discovery of their own. We think Moses\r\ndiscovered and proclaimed it more than three thousand years ago--and\r\nthat it is the only true theory of capital and labor, the only adequate\r\ntheoretical defence of Slavery--for it proves that the profits which\r\ncapital exacts from labor makes free laborers slaves, without the\r\nrights, privileges or advantages of domestic slaves, and capitalists\r\ntheir masters, with all the advantages, and none of the burdens and\r\nobligations of the ordinary owners of slaves.\r\n\r\nThe scientific title of this work would be best expressed by the\r\nconventional French term \"_Exploitation_.\" We endeavor to translate by\r\nthe double periphrases of \"Cannibals All; or, Slaves without Masters.\"\r\n\r\nWe have been imprudent enough to write our Introduction first, and may\r\nfail to satisfy the expectations which we excite. Our excess of candor\r\nmust, in that event, in part supply our deficiency of ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNIBALS ALL!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nTHE UNIVERSAL TRADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are, all, North and South, engaged in the White Slave Trade, and he\r\nwho succeeds best, is esteemed most respectable. It is far more cruel\r\nthan the Black Slave Trade, because it exacts more of its slaves, and\r\nneither protects nor governs them. We boast, that it exacts more, when\r\nwe say, \"that the _profits_ made from employing free labor are greater\r\nthan those from slave labor.\" The profits, made from free labor, are the\r\namount of the products of such labor, which the employer, by means of\r\nthe command which capital or skill gives him, takes away, exacts or\r\n\"exploitates\" from the free laborer. The profits of slave labor are that\r\nportion of the products of such labor which the power of the master\r\nenables him to appropriate. These profits are less, because the master\r\nallows the slave to retain a larger share of the results of his own\r\nlabor, than do the employers of free labor. But we not only boast that\r\nthe White Slave Trade is more exacting and fraudulent (in fact, though\r\nnot in intention,) than Black Slavery; but we also boast, that it is\r\nmore cruel, in leaving the laborer to take care of himself and family\r\nout of the pittance which skill or capital have allowed him to retain.\r\nWhen the day's labor is ended, he is free, but is overburdened with the\r\ncares of family and household, which make his freedom an empty and\r\ndelusive mockery. But his employer is really free, and may enjoy the\r\nprofits made by others' labor, without a care, or a trouble, as to their\r\nwell-being. The negro slave is free, too, when the labors of the day are\r\nover, and free in mind as well as body; for the master provides food,\r\nraiment, house, fuel, and everything else necessary to the physical\r\nwell-being of himself and family. The master's labors commence just when\r\nthe slave's end. No wonder men should prefer white slavery to capital,\r\nto negro slavery, since it is more profitable, and is free from all the\r\ncares and labors of black slave-holding.\r\n\r\nNow, reader, it you wish to know yourself--to \"descant on your own\r\ndeformity\"--read on. But if you would cherish self-conceit, self-esteem,\r\nor self-appreciation, throw down our book; for we will dispel illusions\r\nwhich have promoted your happiness, and shew you that what you have\r\nconsidered and practiced as virtue, is little better than moral\r\nCannibalism. But you will find yourself in numerous and respectable\r\ncompany; for all good and respectable people are \"Cannibals all,\" who do\r\nnot labor, or who are successfully trying to live without labor, on the\r\nunrequited labor of other people:--Whilst low, bad, and disreputable\r\npeople, are those who labor to support themselves, and to support said\r\nrespectable people besides. Throwing the negro slaves out of the\r\naccount, and society is divided in Christendom into four classes: The\r\nrich, or independent respectable people, who live well and labor not at\r\nall; the professional and skillful respectable people, who do a little\r\nlight work, for enormous wages; the poor hard-working people, who\r\nsupport every body, and starve themselves; and the poor thieves,\r\nswindlers and sturdy beggars, who live like gentlemen, without labor, on\r\nthe labor of other people. The gentlemen exploitate, which being done on\r\na large scale, and requiring a great many victims, is highly\r\nrespectable--whilst the rogues and beggars take so little from others,\r\nthat they fare little better than those who labor.\r\n\r\nBut, reader, we do not wish to fire into the flock. \"Thou art the man!\"\r\nYou are a Cannibal! and if a successful one, pride yourself on the\r\nnumber of your victims, quite as much as any Feejee chieftain, who\r\nbreakfasts, dines and sups on human flesh.--And your conscience smites\r\nyou, if you have failed to succeed, quite as much as his, when he\r\nreturns from an unsuccessful foray.\r\n\r\nProbably, you are a lawyer, or a merchant, or a doctor, who have made by\r\nyour business fifty thousand dollars, and retired to live on your\r\ncapital. But, mark! not to spend your capital. That would be vulgar,\r\ndisreputable, criminal. That would be, to live by your own labor; for\r\nyour capital is your amassed labor. That would be, to do as common\r\nworking men do; for they take the pittance which their employees leave\r\nthem, to live on. They live by labor; for they exchange the results of\r\ntheir own labor for the products of other people's labor. It is, no\r\ndoubt, an honest, vulgar way of living; but not at all a respectable\r\nway. The respectable way of living is, to make other people work for\r\nyou, and to pay them nothing for so doing--and to have no concern about\r\nthem after their work is done. Hence, white slave-holding is much more\r\nrespectable than negro slavery--for the master works nearly as hard for\r\nthe negro, as he for the master. But you, my virtuous, respectable\r\nreader, exact three thousand dollars per annum from white labor, (for\r\nyour income is the product of white labor,) and make not one cent of\r\nreturn in any form. You retain your capital, and never labor, and yet\r\nlive in luxury on the labor of others. Capital commands labor, as the\r\nmaster does the slave. Neither pays for labor; but the master permits\r\nthe slave to retain a larger allowance from the proceeds of his own\r\nlabor, and hence \"free labor is cheaper than slave labor.\" You, with\r\nthe command over labor which your capital gives you, are a slave\r\nowner--a master, without the obligations of a master. They who work for\r\nyou, who create your income, are slaves, without the rights of slaves.\r\nSlaves without a master! Whilst you were engaged in amassing your\r\ncapital, in seeking to become independent, you were in the White Slave\r\nTrade. To become independent, is to be able to make other people support\r\nyou, without being obliged to labor for _them_. Now, what man in society\r\nis not seeking to attain this situation? He who attains it, is a slave\r\nowner, in the worst sense. He who is in pursuit of it, is engaged in the\r\nslave trade. You, reader, belong to the one or other class. The men\r\nwithout property, in free society, are theoretically in a worse\r\ncondition than slaves. Practically, their condition corresponds with\r\nthis theory, as history and statistics every where demonstrate. The\r\ncapitalists, in free society, live in ten times the luxury and show that\r\nSouthern masters do, because the slaves to capital work harder and cost\r\nless, than negro slaves.\r\n\r\nThe negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and, in some sense, the\r\nfreest people in the world. The children and the aged and infirm work\r\nnot at all, and yet have all the comforts and necessaries of life\r\nprovided for them. They enjoy liberty, because they are oppressed\r\nneither by care nor labor. The women do little hard work, and are\r\nprotected from the despotism of their husbands by their masters. The\r\nnegro men and stout boys work, on the average, in good weather, not more\r\nthan nine hours a day. The balance of their time is spent in perfect\r\nabandon. Besides, they have their Sabbaths and holidays. White men, with\r\nso much of license and liberty, would die of ennui; but negroes\r\nluxuriate in corporeal and mental repose. With their faces upturned to\r\nthe sun, they can sleep at any hour; and quiet sleep is the greatest of\r\nhuman enjoyments. \"Blessed be the man who invented sleep.\" 'Tis\r\nhappiness in itself--and results from contentment with the present, and\r\nconfident assurance of the future. We do not know whether free laborers\r\never sleep. They are fools to do so; for, whilst they sleep, the wily\r\nand watchful capitalist is devising means to ensnare and exploitate\r\nthem. The free laborer must work or starve. He is more of a slave than\r\nthe negro, because he works longer and harder for less allowance than\r\nthe slave, and has no holiday, because the cares of life with him begin\r\nwhen its labors end. He has no liberty, and not a single right. We know,\r\n'tis often said, air and water, are common property, which all have\r\nequal right to participate and enjoy; but this is utterly false. The\r\nappropriation of the lands carries with it the appropriation of all on\r\nor above the lands, _usque ad coelum, aut ad inferos_. A man cannot\r\nbreathe the air, without a place to breathe it from, and all places are\r\nappropriated. All water is private property \"to the middle of the\r\nstream,\" except the ocean, and that is not fit to drink.\r\n\r\nFree laborers have not a thousandth part of the rights and liberties of\r\nnegro slaves. Indeed, they have not a single right or a single liberty,\r\nunless it be the right or liberty to die. But the reader may think that\r\nhe and other capitalists and employers are freer than negro slaves. Your\r\ncapital would soon vanish, if you dared indulge in the liberty and\r\nabandon of negroes. You hold your wealth and position by the tenure of\r\nconstant watchfulness, care and circumspection. You never labor; but you\r\nare never free.\r\n\r\nWhere a few own the soil, they have unlimited power over the balance of\r\nsociety, until domestic slavery comes in, to compel them to permit this\r\nbalance of society to draw a sufficient and comfortable living from\r\n\"terra mater.\" Free society, asserts the right of a few to the\r\nearth--slavery, maintains that it belongs, in different degrees, to all.\r\n\r\nBut, reader, well may you follow the slave trade. It is the only trade\r\nworth following, and slaves the only property worth owning. All other is\r\nworthless, a mere _caput mortuum_, except in so far as it vests the\r\nowner with the power to command the labors of others--to enslave them.\r\nGive you a palace, ten thousand acres of land, sumptuous clothes,\r\nequipage and every other luxury; and with your artificial wants, you are\r\npoorer than Robinson Crusoe, or the lowest working man, if you have no\r\nslaves to capital, or domestic slaves. Your capital will not bring you\r\nan income of a cent, nor supply one of your wants, without labor. Labor\r\nis indispensable to give value to property, and if you owned every thing\r\nelse, and did not own labor, you would be poor. But fifty thousand\r\ndollars means, and is, fifty thousand dollars worth of slaves. You can\r\ncommand, without touching on that capital, three thousand dollars' worth\r\nof labor per annum. You could do no more were you to buy slaves with it,\r\nand then you would be cumbered with the cares of governing and providing\r\nfor them. You are a slaveholder now, to the amount of fifty thousand\r\ndollars, with all the advantages, and none of the cares and\r\nresponsibilities of a master.\r\n\r\n\"Property in man\" is what all are struggling to obtain. Why should they\r\nnot be obliged to take care of man, their property, as they do of their\r\nhorses and their hounds, their cattle and their sheep. Now, under the\r\ndelusive name of liberty, you work him, \"from morn to dewy eve\"--from\r\ninfancy to old age--then turn him out to starve. You treat your horses\r\nand hounds better. Capital is a cruel master. The free slave trade, the\r\ncommonest, yet the cruellest of trades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nLABOR, SKILL AND CAPITAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing written on the subject of slavery from the time of Aristotle, is\r\nworth reading, until the days of the modern Socialists. Nobody, treating\r\nof it, thought it worth while to enquire from history and statistics,\r\nwhether the physical and moral condition of emancipated serfs or slaves\r\nhad been improved or rendered worse by emancipation. None would\r\ncondescend to compare the evils of domestic slavery with the evils of\r\nliberty without property. It entered no one's head to conceive a doubt\r\nas to the actual freedom of the emancipated. The relations of capital\r\nand labor, of the property-holders to the non-property-holders, were\r\nthings about which no one had thought or written. It never occurred to\r\neither the enemies or the apologists for slavery, that if no one would\r\nemploy the free laborer, his condition was infinitely worse than that of\r\nactual slavery--nor did it occur to them, that if his wages were less\r\nthan the allowance of the slave, he was less free after emancipation\r\nthan before. St. Simon, Fourier, Owen, Fanny Wright, and a few others,\r\nwho discovered and proclaimed that property was not only a bad master,\r\nbut an intolerable one, were treated as wicked visionaries. After the\r\nFrench and other revolutions in Western Europe in 1830, all men suddenly\r\ndiscovered that the social relations of men were false, and that social,\r\nnot political, revolutions were needed. Since that period, almost the\r\nwhole literature of free society is but a voice proclaiming its absolute\r\nand total failure. Hence the works of the socialists contain the true\r\ndefence of slavery.\r\n\r\nMost of the active intellect of Christendom has for the last twenty\r\nyears been engaged in analyzing, detecting and exposing the existing\r\nrelations of labor, skill and capital, and in vain efforts to rectify\r\nthose relations. The philosophers of Europe, who have been thus engaged,\r\nhave excelled all the moral philosophers that preceded them, in the\r\nformer part of their pursuit, but suggested nothing but puerile\r\nabsurdities, in the latter. Their destructive philosophy is profound,\r\ndemonstrative, and unanswerable--their constructive theories, wild,\r\nvisionary and chimerical on paper, and failures in practice. Each one of\r\nthem proves clearly enough, that the present edifice of European society\r\nis out of all rule and proportion, and must soon tumble to pieces--but\r\nno two agree as to how it is to be re-built. \"We must (say they all)\r\nhave a new world, if we are to have any world at all!\" and each has a\r\nlittle model Utopia or Phalanstery, for this new and better world,\r\nwhich, having already failed on a small experimental scale, the inventor\r\nassures us, is, therefore, the very thing to succeed on a large one. We\r\nallude to the socialists and communists, who have more or less tinged\r\nall modern literature with their doctrines. In analyzing society; in\r\ndetecting, exposing, and generalizing its operations and its various\r\nphenomena, they are but grammarians or anatomists, confining philosophy\r\nto its proper sphere, and employing it for useful purposes. When they\r\nattempt to go further--and having found the present social system to be\r\nfatally diseased, propose to originate and build up another in its\r\nstead--they are as presumptuous as the anatomist, who should attempt to\r\ncreate a man. Social bodies, like human bodies, are the works of God,\r\nwhich man may dissect, and sometimes heal, but which he cannot create.\r\nSociety was not always thus diseased, or socialism would have been as\r\ncommon in the past as it is now. We think these presumptuous\r\nphilosophers had best compare it in its healthy state with what it is\r\nnow, and supply deficiencies or lop off excrescencies, as the comparison\r\nmay suggest. But our present business is to call attention to some\r\nvaluable discoveries in the terra firma of social science, which these\r\nsocialists have made in their vain voyages in search of an ever receding\r\nand illusory Utopia. Like the alchymists, although they have signally\r\nfailed in the objects of their pursuits, they have incidentally hit\r\nupon truths, unregarded and unprized by themselves, which will be\r\nvaluable in the hands of more practical and less sanguine men. It is\r\nremarkable, that the political economists, who generally assume labor to\r\nbe the most just and correct measure of value, should not have\r\ndiscovered that the profits of capital represent no labor at all. To be\r\nconsistent, the political economists should denounce as unjust all\r\ninterests, rents, dividends and other profits of capital. We mean by\r\nrents, that portion of the rent which is strictly income. The amount\r\nannually required for repairs and ultimately to rebuild the house, is\r\nnot profit. Four per cent. will do this. A rent of ten per cent. is in\r\nsuch case a profit of six per cent. The four per cent. is but a return\r\nto the builder of his labor and capital spent in building. \"The use of a\r\nthing, is only a fair subject of change, in so far as the article used\r\nis consumed in the use; for such consumption is the consumption of the\r\nlabor or capital of the owner, and is but the exchange of equivalent\r\namounts of labor.\"\r\n\r\nThese socialists, having discovered that skill and capital, by means of\r\nfree competition, exercise an undue mastery over labor, propose to do\r\naway with skill, capital, and free competition, altogether. They would\r\nheal the diseases of society by destroying its most vital functions.\r\nHaving laid down the broad proposition, that equal amounts of labor, or\r\ntheir results, should be exchanged for each other, they get at the\r\nconclusion that as the profits of capital are not the results of labor,\r\nthe capitalist shall be denied all interest or rents, or other profits\r\non his capital, and be compelled in all cases to exchange a part of the\r\ncapital itself, for labor, or its results. This would prevent\r\naccumulation, or at least limit it to the procurement of the coarsest\r\nnecessaries of life. They say, \"the lawyer and the artist do not work so\r\nhard and continuously as the ploughman, and should receive less wages\r\nthan he--a bushel of wheat represents as much labor as a speech or\r\nportrait, and should be exchanged for the one or the other.\" Such a\r\nsystem of trade and exchange would equalize conditions, but would banish\r\ncivilization. Yet do these men show, that, by means of the taxation and\r\noppression, which capital and skill exercise over labor, the rich, the\r\nprofessional, the trading and skillful part of society, have become the\r\nmasters of the laboring masses: whose condition, already intolerable, is\r\ndaily becoming worse. They point out distinctly the character of the\r\ndisease under which the patient is laboring, but see no way of curing\r\nthe disease except by killing the patient.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter, we illustrated their theory of capital by a\r\nsingle example. We might give hundreds of illustrations, and yet the\r\nsubject is so difficult that few readers will take the trouble to\r\nunderstand it. Let us take two well known historical instances: England\r\nbecame possessed of two fine islands, Ireland and Jamaica. Englishmen\r\ntook away, or defrauded, from the Irish, their lands; but professed to\r\nleave the people free. The people, however, must have the use of land,\r\nor starve. The English charged them, in rent, so much, that their\r\nallowance, after deducting that rent, was not half that of Jamaica\r\nslaves. They were compelled to labor for their landlords, by the fear of\r\nhunger and death--forces stronger than the overseer's lash. They worked\r\nmore, and did not get half so much pay or allowance as the Jamaica\r\nnegroes. All the reports to the French and British Parliaments show that\r\nthe physical wants of the West India slaves were well supplied. The\r\nIrish became the subjects of capital--slaves, with no masters obliged by\r\nlaw, self-interest or domestic affections, to provide for them. The\r\nfreest people in the world, in the loose and common sense of words,\r\ntheir condition, moral, physical and religious, was far worse than that\r\nof civilized slaves ever has been or ever can be--for at length, after\r\ncenturies of slow starvation, three hundred thousand perished in a\r\nsingle season, for want of food. Englishmen took the lands of Jamaica\r\nalso, but introduced negro slaves, whom they were compelled to support\r\nat all seasons, and at any cost. The negroes were comfortable, until\r\nphilanthropy taxed the poor of England and Ireland a hundred millions\r\nto free them. Now, they enjoy Irish liberty, whilst the English hold all\r\nthe good lands. They are destitute and savage, and in all respects worse\r\noff than when in slavery.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion unites with self-interest, domestic affection and\r\nmunicipal law to protect the slave. The man who maltreats the weak and\r\ndependant, who abuses his authority over wife, children or slaves, is\r\nuniversally detested. That same public opinion, which shields and\r\nprotects the slave, encourages the oppression of free laborers--for it\r\nis considered more honorable and praiseworthy to obtain large fees than\r\nsmall ones, to make good bargains than bad ones, (and all fees and\r\nprofits come ultimately from common laborers)--to live without work, by\r\nthe exactions of accumulated capital, than to labor at the plough or the\r\nspade, for one's living. It is the interest of the capitalist and the\r\nskillful to allow free laborers the least possible portion of the fruits\r\nof their own labor; for all capital is created by labor, and the smaller\r\nthe allowance of the free laborer, the greater the gains of his\r\nemployer. To treat free laborers badly and unfairly, is universally\r\ninculcated as a moral duty, and the selfishness of man's nature prompts\r\nhim to the most rigorous performance of this cannibalish duty. We appeal\r\nto political economy; the ethical, social, political and economic\r\nphilosophy of free society, to prove the truth of our doctrines. As an\r\nethical and social guide, that philosophy teaches, that social,\r\nindividual and national competition, is a moral duty, and we have\r\nattempted to prove that all competition is but the effort to enslave\r\nothers, without being encumbered with their support. As a political\r\nguide, it would simply have government 'keep the peace;' or, to define\r\nits doctrine more exactly, it teaches \"that it is the whole duty of\r\ngovernment to hold the weak whilst the strong rob them\"--for it punishes\r\ncrimes accompanied with force, which none but the weak-minded commit;\r\nbut encourages the war of the wits, in which the strong and astute are\r\nsure to succeed, in stripping the weak and ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is time, high time, that political economy was banished from our\r\nschools. But what would this avail in free society, where men's\r\nantagonistic relations suggest to each one, without a teacher, that \"he\r\ncan only be just to himself, by doing wrong to others.\" Aristotle, and\r\nmost other ancient philosophers and statesmen, held the doctrine, \"that\r\nas money would not breed, interest should not be allowed.\" Moses, no\r\ndoubt, saw as the modern socialists do, that all other capital stood on\r\nthe same grounds with money. None of it is self-creative, or will\r\n\"breed.\" The language employed about \"usury\" and \"increase\" in 25th\r\nLeviticus, and 23d Deuteronomy, is quite broad enough to embrace and\r\nprohibit all profits of capital. Such interest or \"increase,\" or\r\nprofits, might be charged to the Heathen, but not to the Jews. The whole\r\narrangements of Moses were obviously intended to prevent competition in\r\nthe dealings of the Jews with one another, and to beget permanent\r\nequality of condition and fraternal feelings.\r\n\r\nThe socialists have done one great good. They enable us to understand\r\nand appreciate the institutions of Moses, and to see, that none but\r\nDivinity could have originated them.[1] The situation of Judea was, in\r\nmany respects, anomalous, and we are not to suppose that its political\r\nand social relations were intended to be universal. Yet, here it is\r\ndistinctly asserted, that under certain circumstances, all profits on\r\ncapital are wrong.\r\n\r\nThe reformers of the present day are all teetotalists, and attempt to\r\nbanish evil altogether, not to lessen or restrict it. It would be wiser\r\nto assume that there is nothing, in its essence, evil, in the moral or\r\nphysical world, but only rendered so by the wrongful applications which\r\nmen make of them. Science is every day discovering that the most fatal\r\npoisons, when properly employed, become the most efficacious medicines.\r\nSo, what appear to be the evil passions and propensities of men, and of\r\nsocieties, under proper regulation, may be made to minister to the\r\nwisest and best of purposes. Civilized society has never been found\r\nwithout that competition begotten by man's desire to throw most of the\r\nburdens of life on others, and to enjoy the fruits of their labors\r\nwithout exchanging equivalent labor of his own. In all such societies,\r\n(outside the Bible,) such selfish and grasping appropriation is\r\ninculcated as a moral duty; and he who succeeds best, either by the\r\nexercise of professional skill, or by accumulation of capital, in\r\nappropriating the labor of others, without laboring in return, is\r\nconsidered most meritorious. It would be unfair, in treating of the\r\nrelations of capital and labor, not to consider its poor-house system,\r\nthe ultimate resort of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe taxes or poor rates which support this system of relief, like all\r\nother taxes and values, are derived from the labor of the poor. The\r\nable-bodied, industrious poor are compelled by the rich and skillful to\r\nsupport the weak, and too often, the idle poor. In addition to defraying\r\nthe necessary expenses and the wanton luxuries of the rich, to\r\nsupporting government, and supporting themselves, capital compels them\r\nto support its poor houses. In collection of the poor rates, in their\r\ndistribution, and in the administration of the poor-house system,\r\nprobably half the tax raised for the poor is exhausted. Of the\r\nremainder, possibly another half is expended on unworthy objects.\r\nMasters, in like manner, support the sick, infant and aged slaves from\r\nthe labor of the strong and healthy. But nothing is wasted in collection\r\nand administration, and nothing given to unworthy objects. The master\r\nhaving the control of the objects of his bounty, takes care that they\r\nshall not become burdensome by their own crimes and idleness. It is\r\ncontrary to all human customs and legal analogies, that those who are\r\ndependent, or are likely to become so, should not be controlled. The\r\nduty of protecting the weak involves the necessity of enslaving\r\nthem--hence, in all countries, women and children, wards and\r\napprentices, have been essentially slaves, controlled, not by law, but\r\nby the will of a superior. This is a fatal defect in the poor-house\r\nsystem. Many men become paupers from their own improvidence or\r\nmisconduct, and masters alone can prevent such misconduct and\r\nimprovidence. Masters treat their sick, infant and helpless slaves well,\r\nnot only from feeling and affection, but from motives of self-interest.\r\nGood treatment renders them more valuable. All poor houses, are\r\nadministered on the penitentiary system, in order to deter the poor from\r\nresorting to them. Besides, masters are always in place to render\r\nneedful aid to the unfortunate and helpless slaves. Thousands of the\r\npoor starve out of reach of the poor house, or other public charity.\r\n\r\nA common charge preferred against slavery is, that it induces idleness\r\nwith the masters. The trouble, care and labor, of providing for wife,\r\nchildren and slaves, and of properly governing and administering the\r\nwhole affairs of the farm, is usually borne on small estates by the\r\nmaster. On larger ones, he is aided by an overseer or manager. If they\r\ndo their duty, their time is fully occupied. If they do not, the estate\r\ngoes to ruin. The mistress, on Southern farms, is usually more busily,\r\nusefully and benevolently occupied than any one on the farm. She unites\r\nin her person, the offices of wife, mother, mistress, housekeeper, and\r\nsister of charity. And she fulfills all these offices admirably well.\r\nThe rich men, in free society, may, if they please, lounge about town,\r\nvisit clubs, attend the theatre, and have no other trouble than that of\r\ncollecting rents, interest and dividends of stock. In a well constituted\r\nslave society, there should be no idlers. But we cannot divine how the\r\ncapitalists in free society are to be put to work. The master labors for\r\nthe slave, they exchange industrial value. But the capitalist, living on\r\nhis income, gives nothing to his subjects. He lives by mere\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\nIt is objected that slavery permits or induces immorality and ignorance.\r\nThis is a mistake. The intercourse of the house-servants with the white\r\nfamily, assimilates, in some degree, their state of information, and\r\ntheir moral conduct, to that of the whites. The house-servants, by their\r\nintercourse with the field hands, impart their knowledge to them. The\r\nmaster enforces decent morality in all. Negroes are never ignorant of\r\nthe truths of Christianity, all speak intelligible English, and are\r\nposted up in the ordinary occurrences of the times. The reports to the\r\nBritish Parliament shew, that the agricultural and mining poor of\r\nEngland scarce know the existence of God, do not speak intelligible\r\nEnglish, and are generally depraved and ignorant. They learn nothing by\r\nintercourse with their superiors, as negroes do. They abuse wives and\r\nchildren, because they have no masters to control them, and the men are\r\noften dissipated and idle, leaving all the labor to be done by the women\r\nand children--for the want of this same control.\r\n\r\nSlavery, by separating the mass of the ignorant from each other, and\r\nbringing them in contact and daily intercourse with the well-informed,\r\nbecomes an admirable educational system--no doubt a necessary one. By\r\nsubjecting them to the constant control and supervision of their\r\nsuperiors, interested in enforcing morality, it becomes the best and\r\nmost efficient police system; so efficient, that the ancient Romans had\r\nscarcely any criminal code whatever.\r\n\r\nThe great objections to the colonial slavery of the latter Romans, to\r\nserfdom, and all forms of praedial slavery, are: that the slaves are\r\nsubjected to the cares as well as the labors of life; that the masters\r\nbecome idlers; that want of intercourse destroys the affectionate\r\nrelations between master and slave, throws the mass of ignorant slaves\r\ninto no other association but that with the ignorant; and deprives them,\r\nas well of the instruction, as the government, of superiors living on\r\nthe same farm. Southern slavery is becoming the best form of slavery of\r\nwhich we have any history, except that of the Jews. The Jews owned but\r\nfew slaves, and with them the relation of master and slave was truly\r\naffectionate, protective and patriarchal. The master, wife and children\r\nwere in constant intercourse with the slaves, and formed, in practice as\r\nwell as theory, affectionate, well-ordered families.\r\n\r\nAs modern civilization advances, slavery becomes daily more necessary,\r\nbecause its tendency is to accumulate all capital in a few hands, cuts\r\noff the masses from the soil, lessens their wages and their chances of\r\nemployment, and increases the necessity for a means of certain\r\nsubsistence, which slavery alone can furnish, when a few own all the\r\nlands and other capital.\r\n\r\nChristian morality can find little practical foothold in a community so\r\nconstituted, that to \"love our neighbor as ourself,\" or \"to do unto\r\nothers as we would they should do unto us,\" would be acts of suicidal\r\nself-sacrifice. Christian morality, however, was not preached to free\r\ncompetitive society, but to slave society, where it is neither very\r\ndifficult nor unnatural to practice it. In the various family relations\r\nof husband, wife, parent, child, master and slave, the observance of\r\nthese Christian precepts is often practiced, and almost always promotes\r\nthe temporal well being of those who observe it. The interests of the\r\nvarious members of the family circle, correctly understood, concur and\r\nharmonize, and each member best promotes his own selfish interest by\r\nministering to the wants and interests of the rest. Two great stumbling\r\nblocks are removed from the acceptance of Scripture, when it is proved\r\nthat slavery, which it recognizes, approves and enjoins, is promotive of\r\nmen's happiness and well-being, and that the morality, which it\r\ninculcates, although wholly impracticable in free society, is readily\r\npractised in that form of society to which it was addressed.\r\n\r\nWe do not conceive that there can be any other moral law in free\r\nsociety, than that which teaches \"that he is most meritorious who most\r\nwrongs his fellow beings:\" for any other law would make men martyrs to\r\ntheir own virtues. We see thousands of good men vainly struggling\r\nagainst the evil necessities of their situation, and aggravating by\r\ntheir charities the evils which they would cure, for charity in free\r\nsociety is but the tax which skill and capital levy from the working\r\npoor, too often, to bestow on the less deserving and idle poor. We know\r\na man at the North who owns millions of dollars, and would throw every\r\ncent into the ocean to benefit mankind. But it is capital, and, place it\r\nwhere he will, it becomes an engine to tax and oppress the laboring\r\npoor.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to place labor and capital in harmonious or friendly\r\nrelations, except by the means of slavery, which identifies their\r\ninterests. Would that gentleman lay his capital out in land and negroes,\r\nhe might be sure, in whatever hands it came, that it would be employed\r\nto protect laborers, not to oppress them; for when slaves are worth near\r\na thousand dollars a head, they will be carefully and well provided for.\r\nIn any other investment he may make of it, it will be used as an engine\r\nto squeeze the largest amount of labor from the poor, for the least\r\namount of allowance. We say allowance, not wages; for neither slaves nor\r\nfree laborers get wages, in the popular sense of the term: that is, the\r\nemployer or capitalist pays them from nothing of his own, but allows\r\nthem a part, generally a very small part, of the proceeds of their own\r\nlabor. Free laborers pay one another, for labor creates all values, and\r\ncapital, after taking the lion's share by its taxing power, but pays the\r\nso-called wages of one laborer from the proceeds of the labor of\r\nanother. Capital does not breed, yet remains undiminished. Its profits\r\nare but its taxing power. Men seek to become independent, in order to\r\ncease to pay labor; in order to become masters, without the cares,\r\nduties and responsibilities of masters. Capital exercises a more perfect\r\ncompulsion over free laborers, than human masters over slaves: for free\r\nlaborers must at all times work or starve, and slaves are supported\r\nwhether they work or not. Free laborers have less liberty than slaves,\r\nare worse paid and provided for, and have no valuable rights. Slaves,\r\nwith more of actual practical liberty, with ampler allowance, and\r\nconstant protection, are secure in the enjoyment of all the rights,\r\nwhich provide for their physical comfort at all times and under all\r\ncircumstances. The free laborer must be employed or starve, yet no one\r\nis obliged to employ him. The slave is taken care of, whether employed\r\nor not. Though each free laborer has no particular master, his wants and\r\nother men's capital, make him a slave without a master, or with too many\r\nmasters, which is as bad as none. It were often better that he had an\r\nascertained master, instead of an irresponsible and unascertained one.\r\n\r\nThere are some startling social phenomena connected with this subject of\r\nlabor and capital, which will probably be new to most of our readers.\r\nLegislators and philosophers often puzzle their own and other people's\r\nbrains, in vain discussions as to how the taxes shall be laid, so as to\r\nfall on the rich rather than the poor. It results from our theory, that\r\nas labor creates all values, laborers pay all taxes, and the rich, in\r\nthe words of Gerrit Smith, \"are but the conduits that pass them over to\r\ngovernment.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, since labor alone creates and pays the profits of capital;\r\nincrease and accumulation of capital but increase the labor of the poor,\r\nand lessen their remuneration. Thus the poor are continually forging new\r\nchains for themselves. Proudhon cites a familiar instance to prove and\r\nillustrate this theory: A tenant improves a farm or house, and enhances\r\ntheir rents; his labor thus becomes the means of increasing the tax,\r\nwhich he or some one else must pay to the capitalist. What is true in\r\nthis instance, is true of the aggregate capital of the world: its\r\nincrease is but an increased tax on labor. A., by trade or speculation,\r\ngets hold of an additional million of dollars, to the capital already in\r\nexistence. Now his million of dollars will yield no profit, unless a\r\nnumber of pauper laborers, sufficient to pay its profits, are at the\r\nsame time brought into existence. After supporting their families, it\r\nwill require a thousand of laborers to pay the interest or profits of a\r\nmillion of dollars. It may, therefore, be generally assumed as true,\r\nthat where a country has gained a millionaire, it has by the same\r\nprocess gained a thousand pauper laborers: Provided it has been made by\r\nprofits on foreign trade, or by new values created at home--that is, if\r\nit be an _addition_ of a million to the capital of the nation.\r\n\r\nA nation borrows a hundred millions, at six per cent., for a hundred\r\nyears. During that time it pays, in way of tax, called interest, six\r\ntimes the capital loaned, and then returns the capital itself. During\r\nall this time, to the amount of the interest, the people of this nation\r\nhave been slaves to the lender. He has commanded, not paid, for their\r\nlabor; for his capital is returned intact. In the abstract, and\r\naccording to equity, \"the use of an article is only a proper subject of\r\ncharge, when the article is consumed in the use; for this consumption is\r\nthe consumption of the labor of the lender or hirer, and is the exchange\r\nof equal amounts of labor for each other.\r\n\r\nA., as a merchant, a lawyer, or doctor, makes twenty dollars a day; that\r\nis, exchanges each day of his own labor for twenty days of the labor of\r\ncommon working men, assuming that they work at a dollar a day. In twenty\r\nyears, he amasses fifty thousand dollars, invests it, and settles it on\r\nhis family. Without any labor, he and his heirs, retaining all this\r\ncapital, continue, by its means, to levy a tax of three thousand dollars\r\nfrom common laborers. He and his heirs now pay nothing for labor, but\r\ncommand it. They have nothing to pay except their capital, and that they\r\nretain. (This is the exploitation or despotism of capital, which has\r\ntaken the place of domestic slavery, and is, in fact, a much worse kind\r\nof slavery. Hence arises socialism, which proposes to reconstruct\r\nsociety.) Now, this capitalist is considered highly meritorious for so\r\ndoing, and the poor, self-sacrificing laborers, who really created his\r\ncapital, and who pay its profits, are thought contemptible, if not\r\ncriminal. In the general, those men are considered the most meritorious\r\nwho live in greatest splendor, with the least, or with no labor, and\r\nthey most contemptible, who labor most for others, and least for\r\nthemselves. In the abstract, however, that dealing appears most correct,\r\nwhere men exchange equal amounts of labor, bear equal burdens for\r\nothers, with those that they impose on them. Such is the golden rule of\r\nScripture, but not the approved practice of mankind.\r\n\r\n\"The worth of a thing is just what it will bring,\" is the common trading\r\nprinciple of mankind. Yet men revolt at the extreme applications of\r\ntheir own principle, and denunciate any gross and palpable advantage\r\ntaken of the wants, position and necessities of others as _swindling_.\r\nBut we should recollect, that in all instances where unequal amounts of\r\nlabor are exchanged at par, advantage is really taken by him who gets\r\nin exchange the larger amount of labor, of the wants, position and\r\nnecessities of him who receives the smaller amount.\r\n\r\nWe have said that laborers pay all taxes, but labor being capital in\r\nslave society, the laborers or slaves are not injured by increased\r\ntaxes; and the capitalist or master has to retrench his own expenses to\r\nmeet the additional tax. Capital is not taxed in free society, but _is\r\ntaxed_ in slave society, because, in such society, labor is capital.\r\n\r\nThe capitalists and the professional can, and do, by increased profits\r\nand fees, throw the whole burden of taxation on the laboring class.\r\nSlaveholders cannot do so; for diminished allowance to their slaves,\r\nwould impair their value and lessen their own capital.\r\n\r\nOur expose of what the socialists term the exploitation of skill and\r\ncapital, will not, we know, be satisfactory to slaveholders even; for,\r\nalthough there be much less of such exploitation, or unjust exaction, in\r\nslave society; still, too much of it remains to be agreeable to\r\ncontemplate. Besides, our analysis of human nature and human pursuits,\r\nis too dark and sombre to meet with ready acceptance. We should be\r\nrejoiced to see our theory refuted. We are sure, however, that it never\r\ncan be; but equally sure, that it is subject to many modifications and\r\nlimitations that have not occurred to us. We have this consolation,\r\nthat in rejecting as false and noxious all systems of moral philosophy,\r\nwe are thrown upon the Bible, as containing the only true system of\r\nmorals. We have attempted already to adduce three instances, in which\r\nthe justification of slavery furnished new and additional evidence of\r\nthe truth of Christianity. We will now add others.\r\n\r\nIt is notorious that infidelity appeared in the world, on an extensive\r\nscale, only cotemporaneously with the abolition of slavery, and that it\r\nis now limited to countries where no domestic slavery exists. Besides,\r\nabolitionists are commonly infidels, as their speeches, conventions, and\r\npapers daily evince. Where there is no slavery, the minds of men are\r\nunsettled on all subjects, and there is, emphatically, faith and\r\nconviction about nothing. Their moral and social world is in a chaotic\r\nand anarchical state. Order, subordination and adaptation have vanished;\r\nand with them, the belief in a Deity, the author of all order. It had\r\noften been urged, that the order observable in the moral and physical\r\nworld, furnished strong evidence of a Deity, the author of that order.\r\nHow vastly is this argument now strengthened, by the new fact, now first\r\ndeveloped, that the destruction of social order generates universal\r\nscepticism. Mere political revolutions affect social order but little,\r\nand generate but little infidelity. It remained for social revolutions,\r\nlike those in Europe in 1848, to bring on an infidel age; for, outside\r\nof slave society, such is the age in which we live.\r\n\r\nIf we prove that domestic slavery is, in the general, a natural and\r\nnecessary institution, we remove the greatest stumbling block to belief\r\nin the Bible; for whilst texts, detached and torn from their context,\r\nmay be found for any other purpose, none can be found that even\r\nmilitates against slavery. The distorted and forced construction of\r\ncertain passages, for this purpose, by abolitionists, if employed as a\r\ncommon rule of construction, would reduce the Bible to a mere allegory,\r\nto be interpreted to suit every vicious taste and wicked purpose.\r\n\r\nBut we have been looking merely to one side of human nature, and to that\r\nside rendered darker by the false, antagonistic and competitive\r\nrelations in which so-called liberty and equality place man.\r\n\r\nMan is, by nature, the most social and gregarious, and, therefore, the\r\nleast selfish of animals. Within the family there is little room,\r\nopportunity or temptation to selfishness--and slavery leaves but little\r\nof the world without the family. Man loves that nearest to him best.\r\nFirst his wife, children and parents, then his slaves, next his\r\nneighbors and fellow-countrymen. But his unselfishness does not stop\r\nhere. He is ready and anxious to relieve a famine in Ireland, and\r\nshudders when he reads of a murder at the antipodes. He feels deeply for\r\nthe sufferings of domestic animals, and is rendered happy by witnessing\r\nthe enjoyments of the flocks, and herds, and carroling birds that\r\nsurround him. He sympathizes with all external nature. A parched field\r\ndistresses him, and he rejoices as he sees the groves, and the gardens,\r\nand the plains flourishing, and blooming, and smiling about him. All men\r\nare philanthropists, and would benefit their fellow-men if they could.\r\nBut we cannot be sure of benefiting those whom we cannot control. Hence,\r\nall actively good men are ambitious, and would be masters, in all save\r\nthe name.\r\n\r\nBenevolence, the love of what is without, and the disposition to incur\r\npain or inconvenience to advance the happiness and well-being of what is\r\nwithout self, is as universal a motive of human conduct, as mere\r\nselfishness--which is the disposition to sacrifice the good of others to\r\nour own good.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent philosophy of the day takes cognizance of but half of\r\nhuman nature--and that the worst half. Our happiness is so involved in\r\nthe happiness and well-being of everything around us, that a mere\r\nselfish philosophy, like political economy, is a very unsafe and\r\ndelusive guide.\r\n\r\nWe employ the term Benevolence to express our outward affections,\r\nsympathies, tastes and feelings; but it is inadequate to express our\r\nmeaning; it is not the opposite of selfishness, and unselfishness would\r\nbe too negative for our purpose. Philosophy has been so busy with the\r\nworst feature of human nature, that it has not even found a name for\r\nthis, its better feature. We must fall back on Christianity, which\r\nembraces man's whole nature, and though not a code of philosophy, is\r\nsomething better; for it proposes to lead us through the trials and\r\nintricacies of life, not by the mere cool calculations of the head, but\r\nby the unerring instincts of a pure and regenerate heart. The problem\r\nof the Moral World is too vast and complex for the human mind to\r\ncomprehend; yet the pure heart will, safely and quietly, feel its way\r\nthrough the mazes that confound the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nSUBJECT CONTINUED--EXPLOITATION OF SKILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The worth of a thing, is just what it bring.\" The professional man who\r\ncharges the highest fees is most respected, and he who undercharges\r\nstands disgraced. We have a friend who has been, and we believe will\r\ncontinue to be, one of the most useful men in Virginia. He inherited an\r\nindependent patrimony. He acquired a fine education, and betook himself\r\nlaboriously to an honorable profession. His success was great, and his\r\ncharges very high. In a few years he amassed a fortune, and ceased work.\r\nWe expounded our theory to him. Told him we used to consider him a good\r\nman, and quite an example for the rising generation; but that now he\r\nstood condemned under our theory. Whilst making his fortune, he daily\r\nexchanged about one day of his light labor for thirty days of the\r\nfarmer, the gardener, the miner, the ditcher, the sewing woman, and\r\nother common working people's labor. His capital was but the\r\naccumulation of the results of their labor; for common labor creates all\r\ncapital. Their labor was more necessary and useful than his, and also\r\nmore honorable and respectable. The more honorable, because they were\r\ncontented with their situation and their profits, and not seeking to\r\nexploitate, by exchanging one day of their labor for many of other\r\npeople's. To be exploitated, ought to be more creditable than to\r\nexploitate. They were \"slaves without masters;\" the little fish, who\r\nwere food for all the larger. They stood disgraced, because they would\r\nnot practice cannibalism; rise in the world by more lucrative, less\r\nuseful and less laborious pursuits, and live by exploitation rather than\r\nlabor. He, by practising cannibalism more successfully than others, had\r\nacquired fame and fortune. 'Twas the old tune--\"Saul has slain his\r\nthousands, and David his tens of thousands.\" The more scalps we can\r\nshew, the more honored we are.\r\n\r\nWe told him he had made his fortune by the exploitation of skill, and\r\nwas now living by the still worse exploitation of capital. Whilst\r\nworking, he made thirty dollars a day--that is, exploitated or\r\nappropriated the labor of thirty common working men, and gave in\r\nexchange his own labor, intrinsically less worthy, than any one of\r\ntheirs. But now he was doing worse. He was using his capital as a power\r\nto compel others to work for him--for whom he did not work at all. The\r\nwhite laborers who made his income, or interests and dividends, were\r\nwholly neglected by him, because he did not know even who they were. He\r\ntreated his negro slaves much better. It was true, he appropriated or\r\nexploitated much of the results of their labor, but he governed them and\r\nprovided for them, with almost parental affection. Some of them we knew,\r\nwho feigned to be unfit for labor, he was boarding expensively. Our\r\nfriend at first ridiculed our theory. But by degrees began to see its\r\ntruth, and being sensitively conscientious, was disposed to fret\r\nwhenever the subject was introduced.\r\n\r\nOne day he met us, with a face beaming with smiles, and said, \"I can\r\nexplain and justify that new theory of yours. This oppression and\r\nexaction of skill and capital which we see continually practiced, and\r\nwhich is too natural to man ever to cease, is necessary in order to\r\ndisperse and diffuse population over the globe. Half the good lands of\r\nthe world are unappropriated and invite settlement and cultivation. Most\r\nmen who choose can become proprietors by change of residence. They are\r\ntoo much crowded in many countries, and exploitation that disperses them\r\nis a blessing. It will be time enough to discuss your theory of the\r\ndespotism of skill and capital, when all the world is densely settled,\r\nand the men without property can no longer escape from the exactions of\r\nthose who hold property.\"\r\n\r\nOur friend's theory is certainly ingenious and novel, and goes far to\r\nprove that exploitation is not an unmitigated evil. Under exceptional\r\ncircumstances, its good effects on human happiness and well-being, may\r\ngreatly over-balance its evil influences. Such, probably, is the case at\r\nthe North. There, free competition, and the consequent oppressions of\r\nskill and capital are fiercer and more active than in any other country.\r\nBut in forty-eight hours, laborers may escape to the West, and become\r\nproprietors. It is a blessing to them to be thus expelled, and a\r\nblessing to those who expel them. The emigration to the West rids the\r\nEast of a surplus population, and enriches it by the interchanges of\r\ntrade and commerce which the emigration immediately begets. As an\r\nexceptional form of society, we begin to think that at the North highly\r\nuseful. It will continue to be good and useful until the North-west is\r\npeopled. Then, and not till then, it will be time for Mr. Greely to\r\nbuild phalansteries, and for Gerrit Smith to divide all the lands. We\r\nfind that we shall have to defend the North as well as the South against\r\nthe assaults of the abolitionist--still, we cannot abate a jot or tittle\r\nof our theory: \"Slavery is the natural and normal condition of society.\"\r\nThe situation of the North is abnormal and anomalous. So in desert or\r\nmountainous regions, where only small patches of land can be cultivated,\r\nthe father, wife and children are sufficient for the purpose, and\r\nslavery would be superfluous.\r\n\r\nIn order to make sure that our reader shall comprehend our theory, we\r\nwill give a long extract from the \"Science of Society,\" by Stephen\r\nPearle Andrews of New York. He is, we think, far the ablest writer on\r\nmoral science that America has produced. Though an abolitionist, he has\r\nnot a very bad opinion of slavery. We verily believe, there is not one\r\nintelligent abolitionist at the North who does not believe that slavery\r\nto capital in free society is worse than Southern negro slavery; but\r\nlike Mr. Andrews, they are all perfectionists, with a Utopia in full\r\nview:\r\n\r\nI. Suppose I am a wheelwright in a small village, and the only one of my\r\ntrade. You are travelling with certain valuables in your carriage, which\r\nbreaks down opposite my shop. It will take an hour of my time to mend\r\nthe carriage. You can get no other means of conveyance, and the loss to\r\nyou, if you fail to arrive at the neighboring town in season for the\r\nsailing of a certain vessel, will be $500, which fact you mention to me,\r\nin good faith, in order to quicken my exertions. I give one hour of my\r\nwork and mend the carriage. What am I in equity entitled to charge--what\r\nshould be the _limit of price_ upon my labor?\r\n\r\nLet us apply the different measures, and see how they will operate. If\r\nValue is the limit of price, then the price of the hour's labor should\r\nbe $500. That is the equivalent of the value of the labor to you. If\r\ncost is the limit of price, then you should pay me a commodity, or\r\ncommodities, or a representative in currency, which will procure me\r\ncommodities having in them one hour's labor equally as hard as the\r\nmending of the carriage, without the slightest reference to the degree\r\nof benefit which that labor has bestowed on you; or, putting the\r\nillustration in money, thus: assuming the twenty-five cents to be an\r\nequivalent for an hour's labor of an artizan in that particular trade,\r\nthen, according to the _Cost Principle_, I should be justified in asking\r\nonly twenty-five cents, but according to the _Value Principle_, I should\r\nbe justified in asking $500.\r\n\r\nThe _Value Principle_, in some form of expression, is, as I have said,\r\nthe only _recognized_ principle of trade throughout the world. \"A thing\r\nis worth what it will bring in the market.\" Still, if I were to charge\r\nyou $500, or a fourth part of that sum, and, taking advantage of your\r\nnecessities, force you to pay it, everybody would denounce me, the poor\r\nwheelwright, as an extortioner and a scoundrel. Why? Simply because this\r\nis an _unusual_ application of the principle. Wheelwrights seldom have a\r\nchance to make such a \"speculation,\" and therefore it is not according\r\nto the \"established usages of trade.\" Hence its manifest injustice\r\nshocks, in such a case, the common sense of right. Meanwhile you, a\r\nwealthy merchant, are daily rolling up an immense fortune by doing\r\nbusiness upon the same principle which you condemn in the wheelwright,\r\nand nobody finds fault. At every scarcity in the market, you immediately\r\nraise the price of every article you hold. It is your _business_ to take\r\nadvantage of the necessities of those with whom you deal, by selling to\r\nthem according to the _Value_ to them, and not according to the _Cost_\r\nto you. You go further. You, by every means in your power, create those\r\nnecessities, by buying up particular articles and holding them out of\r\nthe market until the demand becomes pressing, by circulating false\r\nreports of short crops, and by other similar tricks known to the trade.\r\nThis is the same in principle, as if the wheelwright had first dug the\r\nrut in which your carriage upset, and then charged you the $500.\r\n\r\nYet hitherto no one has thought of seriously questioning the principle,\r\nnamely, that \"_Value is the limit of price_,\" or, in other words, that\r\n\"_it is right to take for a thing what it is worth_.\" It is upon this\r\nprinciple or maxim, that all _honorable_ trade professes now to be\r\nconducted, until instances arise in which its oppressive operation is so\r\nglaring and repugnant to the moral sense of mankind, that those who\r\ncarry it out are denounced as rogues and cheats. In this manner a sort\r\nof conventional limit is placed upon the application of a principle\r\nwhich is equally _the principle_ of every swindling transaction, and of\r\nwhat is called legitimate commerce. The discovery has not hitherto been\r\nmade, that the principle itself is essentially vicious, and that in its\r\ninfinite and all-pervading variety of applications, this vicious\r\nprinciple is _the source_ of the injustice, inequality of condition, and\r\nfrightful pauperism and wretchedness which characterize the existing\r\nstate of our so-called civilization. Still less has the discovery been\r\nmade, that there is another simple principle of traffic which, once\r\nunderstood and applied in practice, will effectually rectify all those\r\nmonstrous evils, and introduce into human society the reign of absolute\r\nequity in all property relations, while it will lay the foundations of\r\nuniversal harmony in the social and moral relations as well.\r\n\r\nII. Suppose it costs me ten minutes' labor to concoct a pill which will\r\nsave your life when nothing else will; and suppose, at the same time, to\r\nrender the case simple, that the knowledge of the ingredients came to me\r\nby accident, without labor or _cost_. It is clear that your life is\r\nworth to you more than your fortune. Am I, then, entitled to demand of\r\nyou for the nostrum the whole of your property, more or less? Clearly\r\nso, if _it is right to take for a thing what it is worth_, which is\r\ntheoretically the highest ethics of trade.\r\n\r\nForced, on the one hand, by the impossibility, existing in the nature of\r\nthings, of ascertaining and measuring positive values, or of\r\ndetermining, in other words, what a thing _is really worth_, and\r\nrendered partially conscious by the obvious hardship and injustice of\r\nevery unusual or extreme application of the principle that it is either\r\nno rule or a bad one, and not guided by the knowledge of any true\r\nprinciple out of the labyrinth of conflicting rights into which the\r\nfalse principle conducts, the world has practically abandoned the\r\nattempt to combine Equity with Commerce, and lowered its standard of\r\nmorality to the inverse statement of the formula, namely, that, \"_A\r\nthing is worth what it will bring_;\" or, in other words, that it is\r\nfitting and proper to take for a thing when sold whatever can be got for\r\nit. This, then, is what is denominated the Market Value of an article,\r\nas distinguished from its actual value. Without being more equitable as\r\na measure of price, it certainly has a great practical advantage over\r\nthe more decent theoretical statement, in the fact that it _is_ possible\r\nto ascertain by experiment how much you can force people, through their\r\nnecessities, to give. The principle, in this form, measures the price by\r\nthe degree of _want_ on the part of the purchaser, that is, by what he\r\nsupposes will prove to be the value or benefit to him of the commodity\r\npurchased, in comparison with that of the one with which he parts in the\r\ntransaction. Hence it becomes immediately and continually the interest\r\nof the seller to place the purchaser in a condition of as much want as\r\npossible; \"to corner\" him, as the phrase is in Wall street, and force\r\nhim to buy at the dearest rate. If he is unable to increase his actual\r\nnecessity, he resorts to every means of creating an imaginary want by\r\nfalse praises bestowed upon the qualities and uses of his goods. Hence\r\nthe usages of forestalling the market, of confusing the public knowledge\r\nof Supply and Demand, of advertising and puffing worthless commodities,\r\nand the like, which constitute the existing commercial system--a system\r\nwhich, in our age, is ripening into putrefaction, and coming to offend\r\nthe nostrils of good taste no less than the innate sense of right,\r\nwhich, dreadfully vitiating as it is, it has failed wholly to\r\nextinguish.\r\n\r\nThe Value Principle in this form, as in the other, is therefore _felt_,\r\nwithout being distinctly understood, to be essentially diabolical, and\r\nhence it undergoes again a kind of sentimental modification wherever the\r\n_sentiment_ for honesty is most potent. This last and highest expression\r\nof the doctrine of honesty, as now known in the world, may be stated in\r\nthe form of the hortatory precept, \"Don't be _too_ bad,\" or, \"Don't\r\ngouge _too_ deep.\" No Political Economist, Financier, Moralist, or\r\nReligionist, has any more definite standard of right in commercial\r\ntransactions than that. It is not too much to affirm that neither\r\nPolitical Economist, Financier, Moralist, nor Religionist knows at this\r\nday, nor ever has known, what it is to be honest. The religious teacher,\r\nwho exhorts his hearers from Sabbath to Sabbath to be _fair_ in their\r\ndealings with each other and with the outside world, does not know, and\r\ncould not for his life tell, how much he is, in fair dealing or equity,\r\nbound to pay his washerwoman or his housekeeper for any service whatever\r\nwhich they may render. The _sentiment_ of honesty exists, but the\r\n_science_ of honesty is wanting. The sentiment is first in order. The\r\nscience must be an outgrowth, a consequential development of the\r\nsentiment. The precepts of Christian Morality deal properly with that\r\nwhich is the soul of the other, leaving to intellectual investigation\r\nthe discovery of its scientific complement.\r\n\r\nIt follows from what has been said, that the Value Principle is the\r\ncommercial embodiment of the essential element of conquest and war--war\r\ntransferred from the battle-field to the counter--none the less opposed,\r\nhowever, to the spirit of Christian Morality, or the sentiment of human\r\nbrotherhood. In bodily conflict, the physically strong conquer and\r\nsubject the physically weak. In the conflict of trade, the\r\nintellectually astute and powerful conquer and subject those who are\r\nintellectually feeble, or whose intellectual development is not of the\r\nprecise kind to fit them for the conflict of wits in the matter of\r\ntrade. With the progress of civilization and development we have ceased\r\nto think that superior physical strength gives the _right_ of conquest\r\nand subjugation. We have graduated, in idea, out of the period of\r\nphysical dominion. We remain, however, as yet in the period of\r\nintellectual conquest or plunder. It has not been questioned hitherto,\r\nas a general proposition, that the man who has superior intellectual\r\nendowments to others, has a right resulting therefrom to profit thereby\r\nat the cost of others. In the extreme applications of the admission only\r\nis the conclusion ever denied. In the whole field of what are\r\ndenominated the legitimate operations of trade, there is no other law\r\nrecognized than the relative \"smartness\" or shrewdness of the parties,\r\nmodified at most by the sentimental precept stated above.\r\n\r\nThe intrinsic wrongfulness of the principal axioms and practice of\r\nexisting commerce will appear to every reflecting mind from the\r\npreceding analysis. It will be proper, however, before dismissing the\r\nconsideration of the Value Principle, to trace out a little more in\r\ndetail some of its specific results.\r\n\r\nThe principle itself being essentially iniquitous, all the fruits of the\r\nprinciple are necessarily pernicious.\r\n\r\nAmong the consequences which flow from it are the following:\r\n\r\nI. _It renders falsehood and hypocrisy a necessary concomitant of\r\ntrade._ Where the object is to buy cheap and sell dear, the parties find\r\ntheir interest in mutual deception. It is taught, in theory, that\r\n\"honesty is the best policy,\" in the long run; but in practice the\r\nmerchant discovers speedily that he must starve if he acts upon the\r\nprecept--in the short run. Honesty--even as much honesty as can be\r\narrived at--is _not_ the best policy under the present unscientific\r\nsystem of commerce; if by the best policy is meant that which tends to\r\nsuccess in business. Professional merchants are sharp to distinguish\r\ntheir true policy for that end, and they do not find it in a full\r\nexposition of the truth. Intelligent merchants know the fact well, and\r\nconscientious merchants deplore it; but they see no remedy. The theory\r\nof trade taught to innocent youths in the retired family, or the Sunday\r\nschool, would ruin any clerk, if adhered to behind the counter, in a\r\nfortnight. Hence it is uniformly abandoned, and a new system of morality\r\nacquired the moment a practical application is to be made of the\r\ninstruction. A frank disclosure, by the merchant, of all the secret\r\nadvantages in his possession, would destroy his reputation for sagacity\r\nas effectually as it would that of the gambler among his associates.\r\nBoth commerce and gambling, as professions, are systems of strategy. It\r\nis the business of both parties to a trade to over-reach each other--a\r\nfact which finds its unblushing announcement in the maxim of the Common\r\nLaw, _Caveat emptor_, (let the purchaser take care.)\r\n\r\nII. _It makes the rich richer and the poor poorer._--Trade being, under\r\nthis system, the intellectual correspondence to the occupation of the\r\ncut-throat or conqueror under the reign of physical force--the stronger\r\nconsequently accumulating more than his share at the cost of the\r\ndestruction of the weaker--the consequence of the principle is that the\r\noccupation of trade, for those who possess intellectual superiority,\r\nwith other favorable conditions, enables them to accumulate more than\r\ntheir share of wealth, while it reduces those whose intellectual\r\ndevelopment--of the precise kind requisite for this species of\r\ncontest--and whose material conditions are less favorable--to\r\nwretchedness and poverty.\r\n\r\nIII. _It creates trade for trade's sake, and augments the number of\r\nnon-producers, whose support is chargeable upon Labor._ As trade under\r\nthe operation of this principle, offers the temptation of illicit gains\r\nand rapid wealth at the expense of others, it creates trade where there\r\nis no necessity for trade--not as a beneficent interchange of\r\ncommodities between producers and consumers, but as a means of\r\nspeculation. Hence thousands are withdrawn from actual production and\r\nthrust unnecessarily into the business of exchanging, mutually devouring\r\neach other by competition, and drawing their subsistence and their\r\nwealth from the producing classes, without rendering any equivalent\r\nservice. Hence the interminable range of intermediates between the\r\nproducer and consumer, the total defeat of organization and economy in\r\nthe distribution of products, and the intolerable burden of the\r\nunproductive classes upon labor, together with a host of the frightful\r\nresults of pauperism and crime.\r\n\r\nIV. _It degrades the dignity of Labor._ Inasmuch as trade, under the\r\noperation of this principle, is more profitable, or at any rate is\r\nliable to be, promises to be, and in a portion of cases is more\r\nprofitable than productive labor, it follows that the road to wealth and\r\nsocial distinction lies in that direction. Hence \"Commerce is King,\"\r\nHence, again, productive labor is depreciated and contemned. It holds\r\nthe same relation to commerce in this age--under the reign of\r\nintellectual superioritythat commerce itself held a few generations\r\nsince--under the reign of physical force--to military achievement,\r\npersonal or hereditary. Thus the degradation of labor, and all the\r\ninnumerable evils which follow in its train, in our existing\r\ncivilization, find their efficient cause in this same false principle of\r\nexchanging products. The next stage of progress will be the inauguration\r\nof Equity--equality in the results of every species of industry\r\naccording to burdens, and the consequent accession of labor to the\r\nhighest rank of human estimation. Commerce will then sink to a mere\r\nbrokerage, paid, like any other species of labor, according to its\r\nrepugnance, as the army is now sinking to a mere police force. It will\r\nbe reduced to the simplest and most direct methods of exchange, and made\r\nto be the merest servant of production, which will come, in its turn, to\r\nbe regarded as conferring the only true patents of nobility.\r\n\r\nV. _It prevents the possibility of a scientific Adjustment of Supply to\r\nDemand._ It has been already shown that speculation is the cause why\r\nthere has never been, and cannot now be any scientific Adaptation of\r\nSupply to Demand. It has also been partially shown, at various points,\r\nthat speculation, or trading in chances and fluctuations in the market\r\nhas its root in the Value Principle, and that the Cost Principle\r\nextinguishes speculation. It will be proper, however, in this connection\r\nto define exactly the limits of speculation, and to point out more\r\nspecifically how the Value Principle creates it, and how the Cost\r\nPrinciple extinguishes it.\r\n\r\nBy speculation is meant, in the ordinary language of trade, risky and\r\nunusual enterprises entered upon for the sake of more than ordinary\r\nprofits, and in that sense there is attached to it, among merchants, a\r\nslight shade of imputation of dishonesty or disreputable conduct. As we\r\nare seeking now, however, to employ language in an exact and scientific\r\nway, we must find a more precise definition of the term. The line\r\nbetween ordinary and more than ordinary profits is too vague for a\r\nscientific treatise. At one extremity of the long succession of\r\nchance-dealing and advantage-taking transactions stands gambling, which\r\nis denounced by the common verdict of mankind as merely a more specious\r\nform of robbery. It holds the same relation to robbery itself that\r\nduelling holds to murder. Where is the other end of this succession? At\r\nwhat point does a man begin to take an undue advantage of his fellow man\r\nin a commercial transaction? It clearly appears, from all that has been\r\nshown, that he does so from the moment that he receives from him more\r\nthan an exact equivalent of cost. But it is the constant endeavor of\r\nevery trader, upon any other than the Cost Principle, to do that. The\r\nbusiness of the merchant is profit-making. _Profit_ signifies,\r\netymologically, _something made over and above_, that is, something\r\nbeyond an _equivalent_, or, in its simplest expression, _something for\r\nnothing_.\r\n\r\nIt is clear, then, that there is no difference between profit-making in\r\nits mildest form, speculation in its opprobrious sense as the middle\r\nterm, and gambling as the ultimate, except in degree. There is simply\r\nthe bad gradation of rank which there is between the slaveholder, the\r\ndriver on the slave plantation, and the slave dealer, or between the man\r\nof pleasure, the harlot, and the pimp.\r\n\r\nThe philanthropy of the age is moving heaven and earth to the overthrow\r\nof the institution of slavery. But slavery has no scientific definition.\r\nIt is thought to consist in the feature of chattelism; but an ingenious\r\nlawyer would run his pen through every statute upon slavery in\r\nexistence, and expunge that fiction of the law, and yet leave slavery,\r\nfor all practical purposes, precisely what it is now. It needs only to\r\nappropriate the services of the man by operation of law, instead of the\r\nman himself. The only distinction, then, left between his condition and\r\nthat of the laborer who is robbed by the operation of a false commercial\r\nprinciple, would be in the fact of the oppression being more tangible\r\nand undisguisedly degrading to his manhood.\r\n\r\nIf, in any transaction, I get from you some portion of your earnings\r\nwithout an equivalent, I begin to make you my slave--to confiscate you\r\nto my uses; if I get a larger portion of your services without an\r\nequivalent, I make you still further my slave; and, finally, if I obtain\r\nthe whole of your services without an equivalent--except the means of\r\nkeeping you in working condition for my own sake, I make you completely\r\nmy slave. Slavery is merely one development of a general system of human\r\noppression, for which we have no comprehensive term in English, but\r\nwhich the French Socialists denominate _exploitation_--the abstraction,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, from the working classes of the fruits of their\r\nlabor. In the case of the slave, the instrument of that abstraction is\r\nforce and legal enactments. In the case of the laborer, generally, it is\r\nspeculation in the large sense, or _profit-making_. The slaveholder will\r\nbe found, therefore, upon a scientific analysis, to hold the same\r\nrelation to the trader which the freebooter holds to the blackleg. It is\r\na question of taste which to admire most, the dare-devil boldness of the\r\none, or the oily and intriguing propensities and performances of the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nINTERNATIONAL EXPLOITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs individuals possessing skill or capital exploitate, or compel other\r\nindividuals in the same community to work for them for nothing, or for\r\nundue consideration, precisely in the same way do nations possessed of\r\nthose advantages exploitate other nations with whom they trade, who are\r\nwithout them.\r\n\r\nEngland lends, say, five hundred millions of dollars to governments and\r\nindividuals in America. In a hundred years, she will have withdrawn from\r\nus, in interest, six times the amount loaned or advanced, and at the\r\nexpiration of that time she withdraws the principal itself. We pay\r\nEngland a tax of at least three thousand million of dollars in a\r\ncentury; for her loans to us are probably even larger than the amount\r\nassumed. She commands the results of our labor to that extent, and gives\r\nus not a cent of the results of her labor in return--for her principal\r\nloaned represents her labor, and that we return to her intact. We are,\r\nto that extent, her slaves,--\"slaves without masters;\" for she commands\r\nand enjoys our labor, and is under none of the obligations of a\r\nmaster--to protect, defend and provide for us.\r\n\r\nHer superior skill in the mechanic arts, by means of free trade, taxes\r\nor exploitates us quite as much as her capital. She exchanges her\r\ncomparatively light and skillful labor, for our hard, exposed and\r\nunintellectual labor; and, in the general, compels us to labor three\r\nhours for her, when she labors one for us. Thus, after deducting the\r\ncost of the material, a yard of her cloth will exchange for an amount of\r\nour cotton, corn or meat, that cost three times as much labor to produce\r\nas her yard of cloth.\r\n\r\nAs in society, the skillful and professional tax or exploitate the\r\ncommon laborer, by exchanging one hour of their light labor for many of\r\nthe common workingman's hard labor; as lawyers, doctors, merchants and\r\nmechanics deal with day laborers, so England and New England treat us of\r\nthe South. This theory, and this alone, accounts for England's ability\r\nto pay the interest on her national debt, and yet increase her wealth.\r\nShe effects it all by the immense profits of the exploitation of her\r\nskill and capital; by the power which they give her to command labor,\r\nand appropriate its results, without consideration, or for a very\r\npartial consideration. She trades with the world, and exploitates it\r\nall, except France. France sets the fashion, and this enables her to\r\nexploitate England. England, in her trade with France, has to pay for\r\nFrench fashions as well as French labor. In other words, France\r\npossesses superior skill, and exploitates England by means of it. Labor,\r\nnot skill, is the just and equitable measure of values.\r\n\r\nAmerica sends her cotton, her surplus grain and meats, and other\r\nagricultural products, and her California gold, to England, and gets\r\nworse than nothing in return; for if she were compelled to produce at\r\nhome what she procures from England, she must cultivate a thousand\r\nskillful and intellectual pursuits, instead of being, as she too much\r\nis, confined to the coarse drudgery of common labor. The Southern States\r\nof this Union are exploitated of their labor and their brains, in their\r\ntrade with England and New England. They produce nothing which we had\r\nnot better produce at home. Northern trade exploitates us. Trade further\r\nSouth would enrich us and enlighten us; for we would manufacture for the\r\nfar South. We should become exploitators, instead of being exploitated.\r\n\r\nWhen we were in New Haven, a distinguished abolitionist boasted to us\r\nthat mechanics received two dollars per day for their labor, and, by\r\ntheir China trade, exchanged the products of one day's labor for twenty\r\ndays' labor of the Chinese, who worked for ten cents a day. The New\r\nEngland mechanic was thus the master of twenty Chinese laborers, whose\r\nlabor he commanded for one of his own day's labor. Here was an instance\r\nof individual, not of national exploitation. Well might China dread free\r\ntrade. It gives her taskmasters, who impoverish her people and depress\r\nher civilization; for they, by their machinery and superior skill,\r\nwithdraw her people from a thousand mechanical pursuits that promoted\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nIn Sociology, we explained this subject synthetically: we have tried now\r\nto expound it analytically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFALSE PHILOSOPHY OF THE AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe moral philosophy of our age, (which term we use generically to\r\ninclude Politics, Ethics, and Economy, domestic and national,) is\r\ndeduced from the existing relations of men to each other in free\r\nsociety, and attempts to explain, to justify, to generalize and regulate\r\nthose relations. If that system of society be wrong, and its relations\r\nfalse, the philosophy resulting from it must partake of its error and\r\nfalsity. On the other hand, if our current philosophy be true, slavery\r\nmust be wrong, because that philosophy is at war with slavery. No\r\nsuccessful defence of slavery can be made, till we succeed in refuting\r\nor invalidating the principles on which free society rests for support\r\nor defence. The world, however, is sick of its philosophy; and the\r\nSocialists have left it not a leg to stand on. In fact, it is, in all\r\nits ramifications, a mere expansion and application of Political\r\nEconomy,--and Political Economy may be summed-up in the phrase,\r\n\"Laissez-faire,\" or \"Let alone.\" A system of unmitigated selfishness\r\npervades and distinguishes all departments of ethical, political, and\r\neconomic science. The philosophy is partially true, because selfishness,\r\nas a rule of action and guide of conduct, is necessary to the existence\r\nof man, and of all other animals. But it should not be, with man\r\nespecially, the only rule and guide; for he is, by nature, eminently\r\nsocial and gregarious. His wants, his weakness, his appetites, his\r\naffections, compel him to look without, and beyond self, in order to\r\nsustain self. The eagle and the owl, the lion and the tiger, are not\r\ngregarious, but solitary and self-supporting. They practice political\r\neconomy, because 'tis adapted to their natures. But men and beavers,\r\nherds, bees, and ants, require a different philosophy, another guide of\r\nconduct. The Bible, (independent of its authority,) is far man's best\r\nguide, even in this world. Next to it, we would place Aristotle. But all\r\nbooks written four hundred or more years ago, are apt to yield useful\r\ninstruction, whilst those written since that time will generally\r\nmislead. We mean, of course, books on moral science. We should not be\r\nfar out in saying, that no book on physics, written more than four\r\nhundred years ago, is worth reading, and none on morals written within\r\nthat time. The Reformation, which effected much of practical good, gave\r\nbirth to a false philosophy, which has been increasing and ramifying\r\nuntil our day, and now threatens the overthrow of all social\r\ninstitutions. The right of Private Judgment led to the doctrine of\r\nHuman Individuality, and a Social Contract to restrict that\r\nindividuality. Hence, also, arose the doctrines of Laissez-faire, free\r\ncompetition, human equality, freedom of religion, of speech and of the\r\npress, and universal liberty. The right of Private Judgment, naturally\r\nenough, leads to the right to act on that judgment, to the supreme\r\nsovereignty of the individual, and the abnegation of all government. No\r\ndoubt the Reformation resulted from the relaxation of feudalism and the\r\nincreased liberties of mind and body which men had begun to relish and\r\nenjoy. We have no quarrel with the Reformation, as such, for reform was\r\nneeded; nor with all of the philosophy that has been deduced from it;\r\nbut it is the excess of reform, and the excessive applications of that\r\nphilosophy, to which we object. Man is selfish, as well as social; he is\r\nborn a part and member of society, born and lives a slave of society;\r\nbut he has also natural individual rights and liberties. What are his\r\nobligations to society, what his individual rights, what position he is\r\nentitled to, what duties he should fulfill, depend upon a thousand\r\never-changing circumstances, in the wants and capacities of the\r\nindividual, and in the necessities and well-being of the society to\r\nwhich he belongs. Modern philosophy treats of men only as separate\r\nmonads or individuals; it is, therefore, always partly false and partly\r\ntrue; because, whilst man is always a limb or member of the Being,\r\nSociety, he is also a Being himself, and does not bear to society the\r\nmere relation which the hand or the foot does to the human body. _We_\r\nshall propose no new philosophy, no universal and unerring principles or\r\nguide, in place of those which we assail. A Moral Pathology, which feels\r\nits way in life, and adapts itself to circumstances, as they present\r\nthemselves, is the nearest approach to philosophy, which it is either\r\nsafe or wise to attempt. All the rest must be left to Religion, to\r\nFaith, and to Providence. This inadequacy of philosophy has, in all ages\r\nand nations, driven men to lean on religious faith for support. Though\r\nassailing all common theories, we are but giving bold and candid\r\nexpression to the commonest of thoughts. The universal admiration of the\r\npassages we are about to cite, proves the truth of our theory, whilst it\r\ndebars us of all claim to originality:\r\n\r\nSolomon, melancholy, gloomy, dissatisfied, and tossed upon a sea of\r\nendless doubt and speculation, exclaims, \"Vanity of vanities, saith the\r\nPreacher; all is vanity.\" But, at length, he finds rest from the stormy\r\nocean of philosophy, in the calm haven of faith. How beautiful and\r\nconsoling, and how natural, too, his parting words:\r\n\r\n    \"Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God and keep\r\n    his commandments, for this is the whole duty of man.\"\r\n\r\n    \"For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every secret\r\n    thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.\"\r\n\r\nIn his Tenth, or Golden Satire, JUVENAL comes to a like conclusion,\r\nafter having indulged in like speculations:\r\n\r\n    Nil ergo optabunt homines? Si consilium vis,\r\n  Permittes ipsis expendere numinibus, quid\r\n  Conveniat nobis, rebusque sit utile nostris.\r\n  Nam pro jucundis aptissama quaeque dabunt diis\r\n  Carior est illis homo, quam sibi.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Epicurean HORACE, in his first Satire, sees the same difficulty, but\r\ngives a less satisfactory solution:\r\n\r\n    Est modus in rebus; sunt certi denique fines,\r\n  Quos ultra citraque nequit consistere rectum.\r\n\r\nBURKE'S beautiful words, \"What shadows we are, and what shadows we\r\npursue!\" convey the same thought, without attempting a solution.\r\n\r\nSHAKSPEARE employs the profoundest philosophy, to assail all philosophy:\r\n\r\n  \"There are more things in heaven and earth,\r\n  Horatio, than are dreamt of in your philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nThe infidel, VOLTAIRE, admits that \"philosophy had ascertained few\r\ntruths, done little good;\" and when he sums up that little, satisfies\r\nthe reader that it has done nothing--unless it be to perplex and\r\nmislead.\r\n\r\nHe, Voltaire, also, in another connection, exclaims, mournfully:\r\n\r\n    \"I now repeat this confession, still more emphatically, since the\r\n    more I read, the more I meditate, and the more I acquire, the more\r\n    I am enabled to affirm, that I know nothing.\"\r\n\r\nNEWTON, admitting his own ignorance, is a standing monument of the\r\ninadequacy and futility of moral researches and speculations.\r\n\r\nPINDAR--\r\n\r\n    Man, the frail being of a day,\r\n  Uncertain shadow of a dream,\r\n  Illumined by the heavenly beam,\r\n    Flutters his airy life away.\r\n\r\nAESCHYLUS--\r\n\r\n  Vain thy ardor, vain thy grace,\r\n    They, nor force, nor aid repay;\r\n  Like a dream, man's feeble race,\r\n    Short-lived reptiles of a day.\r\n\r\nSOPHOCLES--\r\n\r\n  'Tis sad to think, but me the farce of life persuades,\r\n  That men are only spectral forms, or hollow shades.\r\n\r\nARISTOPHANES--\r\n\r\n  Come now, ye host of fading lives, like the race of withering leaves,\r\n  Who live a day, creatures of clay, tribes that flit like shadows away;\r\n  Ephemeral, wingless insects, dreamy shapes, that death expects\r\n  Soon to bind in phantom sheaves.\r\n\r\nWe will conclude our citations, which we might continue to the crack of\r\ndoom, (for all who have written well and much, have indulged similar\r\nreflections,) with Doctor Johnson's Rasselas, which is intended to\r\nexpand and apply what others had concisely and tersely stated. The\r\nDoctor's is an elaborate failure.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy can neither account for the past, comprehend the present, nor\r\nforesee and provide for the future. \"I'll none of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nFREE TRADE, FASHION AND CENTRALIZATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiberty and political economy beget and encourage free trade, as well\r\nbetween different localities and different nations, as between\r\nindividuals of the same towns, neighborhoods or nations. The nations\r\npossessed of most skill and capital, and commercial enterprise, and\r\ncunning, gradually absorb the wealth of those nations who possess less\r\nof those qualities. The effect of international free trade, aided by the\r\nfacilities of the credit system, of the mail, and speedy steam\r\ncommunication, is to centralize wealth in a few large cities, such as\r\nNew York, Paris and London; and of social free trade to aggregate wealth\r\nin a few hands in those cities. Theoretically, the disparities of\r\nshrewdness, of skill and business capacity, between nations and\r\nindividuals, would, in the commercial and trading war of the wits, rob\r\nthe weak and simple, and enrich the strong and cunning. The facts of\r\nhistory, and of the increasing inequalities of social, individual and\r\nnational wealth, under the system of free trade, stimulated by political\r\neconomy, correspond with the theory. Every month brings forth its\r\nmillionaire, and every day its thousands of new paupers. New York and\r\nLondon grow richer rapidly on the fruits of a trade that robs the less\r\ncommercial and skillful people who traffic with them.\r\n\r\nBut the worst effect of free trade is, that it begets centres of\r\nopinion, thought and fashions, robs men of their nationality, and\r\nimpairs their patriotism by teaching them to ape foreign manners, affect\r\nforeign dress and opinions, and despise what is domestic. Paris, as the\r\ncentre of thought and fashion, wields as much power, and makes almost as\r\nmuch money as London, by being the centre of trade and capital. An\r\nAmerican or Englishman will give five prices for an article because it\r\nis made in Paris. Thus the want of true self-respect in America and\r\nEngland, makes labor produce more in Paris than elsewhere. A Virginian\r\nthinks it a disgrace to be dressed in home-spun, because home-spun is\r\nunfashionable. The Frenchman prides himself on being a Frenchman; all\r\nother people affect the cosmopolitan.\r\n\r\nThe tendency of all this is to transfer all wealth to London, New York\r\nand Paris, and reduce the civilization of Christendom to a miserable\r\ncopy of French civilization, itself an indifferent copy of Roman\r\ncivilization, which was an imitation, but a falling off from that of\r\nGreece.\r\n\r\nWe pay millions monthly for French silks, French wines, French brandy,\r\nand French trinkets, although we can and do make as comfortable articles\r\nfor dress, and as good liquors, at home. But we despise ourselves, and\r\nadmire the French, and give four hours of American labor for one of\r\nFrench labor, just to be in the fashion. And what is our fashion? To\r\ntreat whatever is American with contempt. People who thus act are in a\r\nfair way to deserve and meet with from others, that contempt which they\r\nfeel for themselves. The little States of Greece each had its dialect,\r\nand cultivated it, and took pride in it. Now, dialects are vulgar and\r\nprovincial. We shall have no men like the Greeks, till the manners,\r\ndress, and dialect of gentlemen, betray, like the wines of Europe, the\r\nvery neighborhood whence they come. So thought Mr. Calhoun, and talked\r\nSouth Carolina dialect in the Senate. But for all that, it was the best\r\nEnglish of the day. Its smack of provincialism gave it a higher flavor.\r\n\r\nWe of the South teach political economy, because it is taught in Europe.\r\nYet political economy, and all other systems of moral science, which we\r\nderive from Europe, are tainted with abolition, and at war with our\r\ninstitutions. We must build up centres of trade, of thought and fashion\r\nat home. We must become national, nay, provincial, and cease to be\r\nimitative cosmopolitans. We must, especially, have good colleges and\r\nuniversities, where young men may learn to admire their homes, not to\r\ndespise them.\r\n\r\nThe South feels the truth of all this, and after a while will begin to\r\nunderstand it. She has been for years earnestly and actively engaged in\r\n_promoting_ the exclusive and protective policy, and preaching free\r\ntrade, non-interference of government and 'let alone.' But she does not\r\nlet alone. She builds roads and canals, encourages education, endows\r\nschools and colleges, improves river navigation, excludes, or taxes\r\nheavily foreign show-men, foreign pedlars, sellers of clocks, &c.; tries\r\nto build up by legislation Southern commerce, and by State legislation\r\nto multiply and encourage industrial pursuits. Protection by the State\r\nGovernment is her established policy--and that is the only expedient or\r\nconstitutional protection. It is time for her to avow her change of\r\npolicy and opinion, and to throw Adam Smith, Say, Ricardo & Co., in the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWe want American customs, habits, manners, dress, manufactures, modes of\r\nthought, modes of expression, and language. We should encourage national\r\nand even State peculiarities; for there are peculiarities and\r\ndifferences in the wants and situations of all people, that require\r\nprovincial and national, not cosmopolitan, institutions and productions.\r\nTake language, for instance. It is a thing of natural growth and\r\ndevelopment, and adapts itself naturally to the changes of time and\r\ncircumstance. It is never ungrammatical as spoken by children, but\r\nalways expressive, practical and natural. Nature is always grammatical,\r\nand language, the child of nature, would continue so, but for the\r\ngrammarians, who, with their Procrustean rules, disturb its proportions,\r\ndestroy its variety and adaptation, and retard its growth. They are to\r\nlanguage what dentists are to teeth: they more often injure it than\r\nimprove it.\r\n\r\nGrammar, lexicography, and rhetoric, applied to language, destroy its\r\ngrowth, variety and adaptability--stereotype it, make it at once\r\nessentially a dead language, and unfit for future use; for new\r\nlocalities, and changes of time and circumstances, beget new ideas, and\r\nrequire new words and new combinations of words. Centralization and\r\ncosmopolitanism have precisely the same effect. They would furnish a\r\ncommon language from the centre, which is only fully expressive and\r\ncomprehensive at that centre. Walking and talking are equally natural,\r\nand talking masters and walking masters equally useless. Neither can\r\nforesee and provide for the thousands of new circumstances which make\r\nchange of language, or varieties of movement necessary. Nature is never\r\nat a loss, and is the only reliable dancing master and grammar teacher.\r\nShe is always graceful and appropriate, and always ready to adapt\r\nherself to changes of time, situation and circumstances.\r\n\r\nParis is becoming the universal model and grammar of Christendom;\r\nnothing is right unless it be a la Parisienne. Now, in truth, nothing\r\ncan be right, natural, appropriate, or in good taste, outside of Paris,\r\nthat is Parisienne. When will our monkey imitative world cease to\r\nsacrifice millions of money, cease to show its want of good sense and\r\npropriety, and cease to render itself ridiculous by aping, what, in the\r\nnature of things, is unsuitable, inappropriate, and unnatural? Fashion,\r\naided by free trade and centralization, is subjecting us to the dominion\r\nof Parisian thought; and commerce, by means of the same agencies, makes\r\nus tributaries to London. Trade and fashion conquer faster than arms.\r\n\r\nAfter the Romans had conquered Greece, Athens became the school and\r\ncentre of thought for the civilized world. Men had but one set of ideas,\r\nbut one set of models to imitate, in the whole range of the fine arts.\r\nInventiveness and originality ceased, and genius was subdued. The rule\r\nof Horace, \"_Nullius addictus in verba magistri jurare_,\" was versed,\r\nand men ceased to think for themselves, but looked to the common\r\nfountain of thought at Athens; where the teachers of mankind borrowed\r\nall their ideas from the past. Improvement and progress ceased, and\r\nimitation, chaining the present to the car of the past, soon induced\r\nrapid retrogression. Thus, we think centralization of thought occasioned\r\nthe decline of civilization. Northern invaders introduced new ideas,\r\nbroke up centralization, arrested imitation, and begot originality and\r\ninventiveness. Thus a start was given to a new and Christian\r\ncivilization. Now, a centralization occasioned by commerce and fashion,\r\nthreatens the overthrow of our civilization, as arms and conquest\r\noverthrew the ancient.\r\n\r\nThe ill effect of centralization of thought, whether its centre be the\r\npast, or some locality of the present, is apparent in the arts and\r\nliterature of the Latin nations of Europe. France, Spain and Italy,\r\nthough possessed of more genius, have displayed less originality than\r\nEngland and Germany. French art is a mere re-hash of Roman art, and very\r\ninferior to its original. The natural growth, changes and adaptation of\r\nlanguage, are admirably described by Horace in his _De Arte Poetica_. He\r\nmakes a great blunder in advising the forming and compounding words from\r\nthe Greek, however; for the very want that occasions new words, shows\r\nthat they cannot be supplied from the past. In the passage we are about\r\nto quote, he seems to have seen and deplored the advent of that age of\r\nrule and criticism that was to stereotype language, thought, art itself,\r\nprevent progress, and inaugurate decline. From Horace's day, criticism\r\nruled, language and art were stereotyped, and the world declined:\r\n\r\n  \"Dixeris egregie, notum si callida verbum,\r\n  Reddiderit junctura novum: si forte necesse est\r\n  Indiciis monstrare recentibus abdita rerum,\r\n  Fingere cinctutis non exaudita Cethegis\r\n  Continget; dabiturque licentia sumpta pudenter;\r\n  Et nova fictaque nuper habebunt verba fidem, si\r\n  Graeco fonte cadant, parce detorta. Quid autem\r\n  Caecilio, Plantoque dabit Romanus, ademptum\r\n  Virgilio, Varioque? ego cur acquirere pauca\r\n  Si possum, invideor; cum lingua Catonis et Enni\r\n  Sermonem patrium ditaverit, et nova rerum\r\n  Nomina protulerit? Licuit, semperque licebit\r\n  Signatum praesente nota procudere nomen.\r\n  Ut silvae foliis pronos mutantur in annos,\r\n  Prima cadunt; ita verborum vetus interit aetas,\r\n  Et juvenum ritu florent modo nata, vigentque.\"\r\n\r\nItaly, of the middle ages, imbibed more of the Christian and chivalric\r\nelement, threw off for a while imitation and subserviency to the past,\r\nand shone forth with brilliant originality in all the works of art. But\r\nshe, like France, has relapsed into imitation of the antique, and falls\r\nfar below either Roman or mediaeval art. With the age of Cervantes,\r\nSpanish genius expired. His happy ridicule expelled the absurdities of\r\nKnight Errantry, but unfortunately expelled, at the same time, the new\r\nelements of thought which Christianity and Chivalry had introduced into\r\nmodern literature. They were its only progressive elements, in the\r\nLatin nations of Europe, who in all else were mere Romans.\r\n\r\nFenelon's Telemaque is a servile imitation of Virgil's AEneid, and that\r\nis an equally servile imitation of Homer. Each copy falls below the\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nNothing shows so strongly the want of originality and want of\r\nindependence of taste and thought among these Latin nations, as their\r\ncontempt for Shakspeare. He violates all the rules of Greek and Roman\r\nart, and erects a higher art of his own; but Frenchmen, Italians, and\r\nSpaniards, have no tastes and no ideas differing from, or in advance of,\r\nthe ancients, and can neither understand nor appreciate the genius of\r\nShakspeare. In Germany, he is almost as much read and admired as in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nImitation, grammar and slavery suit the masses. Liberty and Laissez\r\nfaire, the men of genius, and the men born to command. Genius, in her\r\nmost erratic flights, represents a higher Grammar than Dr. Blair or\r\nLindlay Murray--the grammar of progressive nature. To secure true\r\nprogress, we must unfetter genius, and chain down mediocrity. Liberty\r\nfor the few--Slavery, in every form, for the mass!\r\n\r\nThe rules of art destroy art. Homer never could have produced the Iliad,\r\nhad he learned grammar and rhetoric and criticism. 'Tis well for the\r\nworld, he lived before Longinus. Euripides, Sophocles, and\r\nAristophanes, and the Greek Masters in Sculpture and Painting, knew\r\nnothing of the rules of art and canons of criticism. Without the modern\r\nhelps to art, Grecian art so far excelled ours, that it is a popular\r\ntheory that they possessed an Ideal that has been lost. Early in the\r\ndays of the Roman Empire, the rhetoricians, by attempting to teach\r\neloquence by rule, so corrupted it, that the Emperors found it necessary\r\nto banish them from Rome.\r\n\r\nWe are no doubt indebted to the ignorance of the ancients for the\r\ninvention of Gothic architecture. No one taught to reverence Greek\r\narchitecture, would have violated its rules by imitating the Gothic.\r\n\r\nWhen about the time of the Reformation, the study of the ancients was\r\nrevived, each Gothic spire stopped half way in its course towards\r\nheaven. Mediaeval art expired:--and now the world has no art, but basely\r\ncopies the past.\r\n\r\nHad Shakspeare been as learned as Ben Jonson, he would have written no\r\nbetter than Ben Jonson. The lofty genius of Milton would have created a\r\nglorious English epic, had he not travelled too much abroad, and dwelt\r\ntoo much with the past. The Paradise Lost is a splendid piece of Mosaic,\r\nmade up of bits of Greek and Roman mythology, Hebrew theology, Christian\r\nmorality, Mediaeval romance, set in the purest Anglo-Saxon, twisted into\r\nLatin collocation. 'Tis the song of the mocking-bird.\r\n\r\nWhat, then? Shall we not in boyhood sojourn and linger at Athens and at\r\nRome, nor in manhood travel into France and Italy?\r\n\r\n_Est modus in rebus._ Study the past, but be careful not to copy it, and\r\nnever travel abroad until age has matured your love and respect for your\r\nnative land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WORLD IS _TOO LITTLE_ GOVERNED.\r\n\r\n  Whether with reason or with instinct blest,\r\n  All enjoy that power that suits them best;\r\n  Order is Heaven's first law, and this confessed,\r\n  Some are, and must be greater than the rest--\r\n  More rich, more wise; but who infers from hence\r\n  That such are happier, shocks all common sense.\r\n  Heaven to mankind impartial, we confess,\r\n  If all are equal in their happiness;\r\n  But mutual wants this happiness increase,\r\n  All nature's difference, keeps all nature's peace:\r\n  Condition, circumstance, is not the thing;\r\n  Bliss is the same, in subject, or in king!\r\n\r\n                                                   POPE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMobs, secret associations, insurance companies, and social and\r\ncommunistic experiments, are striking features and characteristics of\r\nour day, outside of slave society. They are all attempting to supply the\r\ndefects of regular governments, which have carried the \"Let alone\"\r\npractice so far, that one-third of mankind are let alone to indulge in\r\nsuch criminal immoralities as they please, and another third to starve.\r\nMobs (_vide_ California) supply the deficiencies of a defective police,\r\nand insurance companies and voluntary unions and associations afford\r\nthat security and protection which government, under the lead of\r\npolitical economy, has ceased to render.\r\n\r\nA lady remarked to us, a few days since, \"that society was like an army,\r\nin which the inferior officers were as necessary as the\r\ncommander-in-chief. Demoralization and insubordination ensue if you\r\ndispense with sergeants and corporals in an army, and the same effects\r\nresult from dispensing with guardians, masters and heads of families in\r\nsociety.\" We don't know whether she included the ladies in her ideas of\r\nthe heads of families; protesting against such construction of her\r\nlanguage, we accept and thank her for her illustration. Rev'd Nehemiah\r\nAdams has a similar thought in his admirable work, \"A Southside View of\r\nSlavery,\" which we regret is not before us. On some public occasion in\r\nCharleston, he was struck with the good order and absence of all\r\ndissipation, and very naively asked where was their mob. He was informed\r\nthat \"they were at work.\" He immediately perceived that slavery was an\r\nadmirable police institution, and moralizes very wisely on the occasion.\r\nSlavery is an indispensable police institution;--especially so, to check\r\nthe cruelty and tyranny of vicious and depraved husbands and parents.\r\nHusbands and parents have, in theory and practice, a power over their\r\nsubjects more despotic than kings; and the ignorant and vicious\r\nexercise their power more oppressively than kings. Every man is not fit\r\nto be king, yet all must have wives and children. Put a master over them\r\nto check their power, and we need not resort to the unnatural remedies\r\nof woman's rights, limited marriages, voluntary divorces, and free love,\r\nas proposed by the abolitionists.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlyle says, \"Among practical men the idea prevails that government\r\ncan do nothing but 'keep the peace.' They say all higher tasks are\r\nunsafe for it, impossible for it, and, in fine, not necessary for it or\r\nfor us. Truly, it is high time that same beautiful notion of\r\nNo-Government should take itself away. The world is daily rushing\r\ntowards wreck whilst it lasts. If your government is to be a constituted\r\nanarchy, what issue can it have? Our own interest in such government is,\r\nthat it would be kind enough to cease and go its way before the\r\ninevitable wreck.\"\r\n\r\nThe reader will excuse us for so often introducing the thoughts and\r\nwords of others. We do so not only for the sake of their authority, but\r\nbecause they express our own thoughts better than we can express them\r\nourselves. In truth, we deal out our thoughts, facts and arguments in\r\nthat irregular and desultory way in which we acquired them. We are no\r\nregular built scholar--have pursued no \"royal road to mathematics,\" nor\r\nto anything else. We have, by observation and desultory reading, picked\r\nup our information by the wayside, and endeavored to arrange, generalize\r\nand digest it for ourselves. To learn \"to forget,\" is almost the only\r\nthing we have labored to learn. We have been so bored through life by\r\nfriends with dyspeptic memories, who never digest what they read,\r\nbecause they never forget it, who retain on their intellectual stomachs\r\nin gross, crude, undigested, and unassimilated form, every thing that\r\nthey read, and retail and repeat it in that undigested form to every\r\ngood-natured listener: we repeat, that we have been so bored by friends\r\nwith good memories, that we have resolved to endeavor to express what\r\nwas useful out of facts, and then to throw the facts away. A great\r\nmemory is a disease of the mind, which we are surprised no medical\r\nwriter has noticed. The lunatic asylum should make provision for those\r\naffected with this disease; for, though less dangerous, they are far\r\nmore troublesome and annoying than any other class of lunatics.\r\nLearning, observation, reading, are only useful in the general, as they\r\nadd to the growth of the mind. Undigested and unforgotten, they can no\r\nmore have this effect, than undigested food on the stomach of a\r\ndyspeptic can add to his physical stature. We thought once this thing\r\nwas original with us, but find that Say pursued this plan in writing his\r\nPolitical Economy. He first read all the books he could get hold of on\r\nthis subject, and then took time to forget them, before he began to\r\nwrite.\r\n\r\nWe will not trouble the reader further, for the present, with our\r\negotisms or our arguments, but refer him to the whole of Carlyle's\r\n\"Latter Day Pamphlets,\" to prove that \"the world is too little\r\ngoverned,\" and, therefore, is going to wreck. We say, to the whole of\r\nthose pamphlets, for that is their one, great leading idea. We also add\r\nan extract from the speech of Ulysses, in the play of Troilus and\r\nCressida, that beautifully illustrates and enforces our thought. We give\r\nthe extract because it is a play that few read, it being, on the whole,\r\nfar inferior to Shakspeare's other plays, and by few considered as\r\nwholly, if at all, his work:\r\n\r\n  \"The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre,\r\n  Observe degree, priority, and place,\r\n  Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,\r\n  Office and custom, in all line of order:\r\n  And, therefore, is the glorious planet, Sol,\r\n  In nobler eminence enthron'd and spher'd\r\n  Amidst the other; whose med'cinable eye\r\n  Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,\r\n  And posts, like the commandment of a king,\r\n  Sans check, to good and bad: But, when the planets,\r\n  In evil mixture, to disorder wander,\r\n  What plagues, and what portents? what mutiny?\r\n  What raging of the sea? shaking of earth?\r\n  Commotion in the winds? frights, changes, horrors,\r\n  Divert and crack, rend and deracinate,\r\n  The unity and married calm of states\r\n  Quite from their fixture? O, when degree is shak'd,\r\n  Which is the ladder of all high designs,\r\n  The enterprise is sick! How could communities,\r\n  Degrees in schools, and brotherhoods in cities,\r\n  Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,\r\n  The primogenitive and due of birth,\r\n  Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,\r\n  But by degree, stand in authentic place?\r\n  Take but degree away, untune that string,\r\n  And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets\r\n  In mere oppugnancy: The bounded waters\r\n  Should lift their bosom's higher than the shores,\r\n  And make a sop of all this solid globe:\r\n  Strength should be lord of imbecility,\r\n  And the rude son should strike his father dead:\r\n  Force should be right; or, rather, right and wrong.\r\n  (Between whose endless jar justice resides,)\r\n  Should lose their names, and so should justice too.\r\n\r\nWe promised to write no more in this chapter; but, like Parthos, when\r\n\"we have an idea,\" we want to give others the benefit of it. We agree\r\nwith Mr. Jefferson, that all men have natural and inalienable rights. To\r\nviolate or disregard such rights, is to oppose the designs and plans of\r\nProvidence, and cannot \"come to good.\" The order and subordination\r\nobservable in the physical, animal and human world, show that some are\r\nformed for higher, others for lower stations--the few to command, the\r\nmany to obey. We conclude that about nineteen out of every twenty\r\nindividuals have \"a natural and inalienable right\" to be taken care of\r\nand protected; to have guardians, trustees, husbands, or masters; in\r\nother words, they have a natural and inalienable right to be slaves. The\r\none in twenty are as clearly born or educated, or some way fitted for\r\ncommand and liberty. Not to make them rulers or masters, is as great a\r\nviolation of natural right, as not to make slaves of the mass. A very\r\nlittle individuality is useful and necessary to society,--much of it\r\nbegets discord, chaos and anarchy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Since writing this chapter, we have received our copy of Mr.\r\nAdams's work. We congratulate ourselves on our success in \"learning\r\nto forget.\" Here is the passage to which we refer:\r\n\r\n    \"One consequence of the disposal of the colored people, as to\r\n    individual control, is the absence of mobs. That fearful element\r\n    in society, an irresponsible and low class, is diminished at the\r\n    South. Street brawls and conflicts between two races of laboring\r\n    people, or the ignorant and more excitable portions of different\r\n    religious denominations, are mostly unknown within the bounds of\r\n    slavery. Our great source of disturbance at the North, jealousy\r\n    and collisions between Protestant and Irish Roman Catholic\r\n    laborers, is obviated there.\r\n\r\n    \"When the remains of Mr. Calhoun were brought to Charleston, a\r\n    gentleman from a free State in the procession said to a southern\r\n    gentleman, \"Where is your underswell?\" referring to the motley\r\n    crowd of men and boys of all nations which gather in most of our\r\n    large places on public occasions. He was surprised to learn that\r\n    those respectable, well-dressed, well-behaved colored men and boys\r\n    on the sidewalks, were a substitute for that class of population\r\n    which he had elsewhere been accustomed to see with repugnant\r\n    feelings on public occasions.\"\r\n\r\nAs we are on the subject of Mr. Adams's book, we will give another\r\nextract from it, confirmatory of our doctrines:\r\n\r\n    \"There is another striking peculiarity of Southern society which\r\n    is attributable to slavery, and is very interesting to a\r\n    Northerner at the present day. While the colored people are\r\n    superstitious and excitable, popular delusions and fanaticisms do\r\n    not prevail among them. That class of society among us in which\r\n    these things get root, has a substitute in the colored population.\r\n    Spiritual rappings, biology, second-adventism, Mormonism, and the\r\n    whole spawn of errors which infest us, do not find subjects at the\r\n    South. There is far more faith in the South, taken as a whole,\r\n    than with us. Many things which we feel called to preach against\r\n    here are confined to the boundaries of the Free States; yet the\r\n    white population are readers of books, though not of newspapers,\r\n    perhaps more generally than we. That vast amount of active but\r\n    uninstructed mind with us, which seizes every new thing, and\r\n    follows brilliant or specious error, and erects a folly into a\r\n    doctrine with a sect annexed, and so infuses doubt or contempt of\r\n    things sacred into many minds, is no element in Southern life.\r\n    This is one reason why there is more faith, less infidelity, at\r\n    the South, than at the North. The opinions of a lower class on\r\n    moral and religious subjects, have a powerful effect on the\r\n    classes above them; more than is generally acknowledged; and hence\r\n    we derive an argument in favor of general education, in which\r\n    moral and religious principles shall have their important place.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nLIBERTY AND SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n                                    Effugit imago,\r\n      Par livibus ventis, volueri que simillima somno.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seems to us that the vain attempts to define liberty in theory, or to\r\nsecure its enjoyment in practice, proceed from the fact that man is\r\nnaturally a social and gregarious animal, subject, not by contract or\r\nagreement, as Locke and his followers assume, but by birth and nature,\r\nto those restrictions of liberty which are expedient or necessary to\r\nsecure the good of the human hive, to which he may belong. There is no\r\nsuch thing as _natural human_ liberty, because it is unnatural for man\r\nto live alone and without the pale and government of society. Birds, and\r\nbeasts of prey, who are not gregarious, are naturally free. Bees and\r\nherds are naturally subjects or slaves of society. Such is the theory of\r\nAristotle, promulged more than two thousand years ago, generally\r\nconsidered true for two thousand years, and destined, we hope, soon\r\nagain to be accepted as the only true theory of government and society.\r\n\r\nModern social reformers, except Mr. Carlyle, proceeding upon the theory\r\nof Locke, which is the opposite of Aristotle, propose to dissolve and\r\ndisintegrate society; falsely supposing that they thereby follow nature.\r\nThere is not a human tie that binds man to man, that they do not propose\r\nto cut \"sheer asunder.\" 'Tis true, after their work of destruction is\r\nfinished, they see the necessity of society; but instead of that natural\r\nand historical society, which has usually existed in the world, with its\r\ngradations of rank and power, its families and its slaves, they propose\r\nwholly to disregard the natural relations of mankind, and profanely to\r\nbuild up states, like Fourierite Phalansteries, or Mormon and Oneida\r\nvillages, where religion shall be banished, and in which property, wife\r\nand children shall be held somewhat in common. These social\r\nestablishments, under a self-elected despotism like that of Joe Smith,\r\nor Brigham Young, become patriarchal, and succeed, so long as such\r\ndespotism lasts. That is, when the association loses the character\r\nintended by its founders, and acquires a despotic head like other family\r\nassociations, it works well, because it works naturally. But this\r\nsuccess can only be temporary; for nothing but the strong rule of a\r\nCromwell or Joe Smith can keep a society together, that wants the\r\nelements of cohesion, in the natural ties that bind man to man: and\r\nCromwells and Joe Smiths are not to be found every day.\r\n\r\n'Tis an historical fact, that this family association, this patriarchal\r\ngovernment, for purposes of defence against enemies from without,\r\ngradually merges into larger associations of men under a common\r\ngovernment or ruler. This latter is the almost universal, and we may\r\nthence infer, natural and normal condition of civilized man. In this\r\nstate of society there is no liberty for the masses. Liberty has been\r\nexchanged by nature for security.\r\n\r\nWhat is falsely called Free Society, is a very recent invention. It\r\nproposes to make the weak, ignorant and poor, free, by turning them\r\nloose in a world owned exclusively by the few (whom nature and education\r\nhave made strong, and whom property has made stronger,) to get a living.\r\nIn the fanciful state of nature, where property is unappropriated, the\r\nstrong have no weapons but superior physical and mental power with which\r\nto oppress the weak. Their power of oppression is increased a thousand\r\nfold, when they become the exclusive owners of the earth and all the\r\nthings thereon. They are masters without the obligations of masters, and\r\nthe poor are slaves without the rights of slaves.\r\n\r\nIt is generally conceded, even by abolitionists, that the serfs of\r\nEurope were liberated because the multitude of laborers, and their\r\ncompetition as freemen to get employment, had rendered free labor\r\ncheaper than slave labor. But, strange to say, few seem to have seen\r\nthat this is in fact asserting that they were less free after\r\nemancipation than before. Their obligation to labor was increased; for\r\nthey were compelled to labor more than before to obtain a livelihood,\r\nelse their free labor would not have been cheaper than their labor as\r\nslaves. They lost something in liberty, and everything in rights--for\r\nemancipation liberated or released the masters from all their burdens,\r\ncares and liabilities, whilst it increased both the labors and the cares\r\nof the liberated serf. In our chapter on the Decay of English Liberty,\r\nwe show that the whole struggle in England has been to oppress the\r\nworking man, pull down the powers, privileges and prerogatives of the\r\nthrone, the nobility, and the church, and to elevate the\r\nproperty-holding class. The extracts from the Era and Northern\r\nChurchman, in another chapter, will further elucidate this subject. We\r\npromised to confirm our doctrine of the illusory and undefinable\r\ncharacter of liberty and slavery, by extracts from standard authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n    PALEY on Civil Liberty:\r\n\r\n    \"To do what we will, is natural liberty: to do what we will,\r\n    consistently with the interest of the community to which we\r\n    belong, is civil liberty; that is to say, the only liberty to be\r\n    desired in a state of civil society.\r\n\r\n    I should wish, no doubt, to be allowed to act, in every instance,\r\n    as I pleased; but I reflect, that the rest also of mankind would\r\n    then do the same; in which state of universal independence and\r\n    self-direction, I should meet with so many checks and obstacles to\r\n    my own will, from the interference and opposition of other men's,\r\n    that not only my happiness, but my liberty, would be less than\r\n    whilst the whole community were subject to the dominion of equal\r\n    laws.\r\n\r\n    The boasted liberty of a state of nature exists only in a state of\r\n    solitude. In every kind and degree of union and intercourse with\r\n    his species, it is possible that the liberty of the individual may\r\n    be augmented by the very laws which restrain it; because he may\r\n    gain more from the limitation of other men's freedom than he\r\n    suffers by the diminution of his own. Natural liberty is the right\r\n    of common upon a waste; civil liberty is the safe, exclusive,\r\n    unmolested enjoyment of a cultivated enclosure.\r\n\r\n    The definitions which have been framed of civil liberty, and which\r\n    have become the subject of much unnecessary altercation, are most\r\n    of them adapted to this idea. Thus, one political writer makes the\r\n    essence of the subject's liberty to consist in his being governed\r\n    by no laws but those to which he hath actually consented; another\r\n    is satisfied with an indirect and virtual consent; another, again,\r\n    places civil liberty in the separation of the legislative and\r\n    executive offices of government; another in the being governed by\r\n    _law_; that is, by known, preconstituted, inflexible rules of\r\n    action and adjudication; a fifth, in the exclusive right of the\r\n    people to tax themselves by their own representatives; a sixth, in\r\n    freedom and purity of elections of representatives; a seventh, in\r\n    the control which the democratic part of the constitution\r\n    possesses over the military establishment.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    MONTESQUIEU on Liberty:\r\n\r\n    \"There is no word that has admitted of more various\r\n    significations, and has made more different impressions on human\r\n    minds, than that of _liberty_. Some have taken it for a faculty of\r\n    deposing a person on whom they had conferred a tyrannical\r\n    authority; others, for the power of choosing a person whom they\r\n    are obliged to obey; others, for the right of bearing arms, and of\r\n    being thereby enabled to use violence; others, for the privilege\r\n    of being governed by a native of their own country, or by their\r\n    own laws. A certain nation for a long time thought that liberty\r\n    consisted in the privilege of wearing a long beard.\r\n\r\n    Some have annexed this name to one form of government, in\r\n    exclusion of others; those who had a republican taste applied it\r\n    to this government; those who liked a monarchical state, gave it\r\n    to monarchies. Thus, they all have applied the name of liberty to\r\n    the government most conformable to their own customs and\r\n    inclinations; and as in a republic, people have not so constant\r\n    and so present a view of the institutions they complain of, and\r\n    likewise as the laws there seem to speak more, and the executors\r\n    of the laws least, it is generally attributed to republics, and\r\n    denied to monarchies. In fine, as in democracies, the people seem\r\n    to do very near whatever they please, liberty has been placed in\r\n    this sort of government, and the power of the people has been\r\n    confounded with their liberty.\r\n\r\n    It is true, that in democracies the people seem to do what they\r\n    please; but political liberty does not consist in an unrestrained\r\n    freedom. In governments, that is, in societies directed by laws,\r\n    liberty can consist only in the power of doing what we ought to\r\n    will, and in not being constrained to do what we ought not to\r\n    will.\r\n\r\n    We must have continually present to our minds the difference\r\n    between independence and liberty. Liberty is a right of doing\r\n    whatever the laws permit; and if a citizen could do what they\r\n    forbid, he would no longer be possessed of liberty, because all\r\n    his fellow citizens would have the same power.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n    BLACKSTONE on Liberty:\r\n\r\n    \"The absolute right of man, considered as a free agent, endowed\r\n    with discernment to know good from evil, and with power of\r\n    choosing those measures which appear to him to be most desirable,\r\n    are usually summed up in one general appellation, and denominated\r\n    the natural liberty of mankind.\r\n\r\n    This natural liberty consists properly in a power of acting as one\r\n    thinks fit, without any restraint or control, unless by the law of\r\n    nature; being a right inherent in us by birth, and one of the\r\n    gifts of God to man at his creation, when he endued him with the\r\n    faculty of free will. But every man, when he enters into society,\r\n    gives up a part of his natural liberty, as the price of so\r\n    valuable a purchase; and, in consideration of receiving the\r\n    advantages of mutual commerce, obliges himself to conform to\r\n    those laws which the community has thought proper to establish.\r\n    And this species of legal obedience and conformity is infinitely\r\n    more desirable than that wild and savage liberty which is\r\n    sacrificed to obtain it. For, no man that considers a moment,\r\n    would wish to retain the absolute, uncontrolled power of doing\r\n    what he pleases; the consequence of which is, that every other man\r\n    would also have the same power; and then there would be no\r\n    security to individuals in any of the enjoyments of life.\r\n    Political, therefore, or civil liberty, which is that of a member\r\n    of society, is no other than natural liberty, so far restrained by\r\n    human laws, (and no farther,) as is necessary and expedient for\r\n    the general advantage of the public. Hence, we may collect that\r\n    the law, which restrains a man from doing mischief to his fellow\r\n    citizens, though it diminishes the natural, increases the civil\r\n    liberty of mankind; but that every wanton and causeless restraint\r\n    of the will of the subject, whether practiced by a monarch, a\r\n    nobility, or a popular assembly, is a degree of tyranny: nay, that\r\n    even laws themselves, whether made with or without our consent, if\r\n    they regulate and constrain our conduct in matters of mere\r\n    indifference, without any good end in view, are regulations\r\n    destructive of liberty; whereas, if any public advantage can arise\r\n    from observing such precepts, the control of our private\r\n    inclinations, in one or two particular points, will conduce to\r\n    preserve our general freedom in others of more importance, by\r\n    supporting that state of society which can alone secure our\r\n    independence. Thus the statute of King Edward IV, which forbade\r\n    the fine gentlemen of those times (under the degree of a lord) to\r\n    wear pikes upon their shoes or boots of more than two inches in\r\n    length, was a law that savored of oppression; because, however\r\n    ridiculous the fashion then in use might appear, the restraining\r\n    it by pecuniary penalties, could serve no purpose of common\r\n    utility. But the statute of King Charles II, which prescribes a\r\n    thing seemingly as indifferent, (a dress for the dead, who are all\r\n    ordered to be buried in woollen,) is a law consistent with public\r\n    liberty; for it encourages the staple trade, on which, in great\r\n    measure, depends the universal good of the nation. So that laws,\r\n    when prudently framed, are by no means subversive, but rather\r\n    introductive of liberty; for, (as Mr. Locke has well observed,)\r\n    where there is no law, there is no freedom. But then, on the other\r\n    hand, that constitution or frame of government--that system of\r\n    laws, is alone calculated to maintain civil liberty, which leaves\r\n    the subject entire master of his own conduct, except in those\r\n    points wherein the public good requires some direction or\r\n    restraint.\r\n\r\n    The idea and practice of this political or civil liberty, flourish\r\n    in their highest vigor in those kingdoms where it falls little\r\n    short of perfection, and can only be lost or destroyed by the\r\n    folly or demerits of its owner: the legislature, and of course the\r\n    laws of England, being peculiarly adapted to the preservation of\r\n    this inestimable blessing even in the meanest subject.\r\n\r\n    Very different from the modern constitutions of other States on\r\n    the continent of Europe, and from the genius of the imperial law,\r\n    which, in general, are calculated to vest an arbitrary and\r\n    despotic power of controlling the actions of the subject, in the\r\n    prince or in a few grandees. And this spirit of liberty is so\r\n    deeply implanted in our constitution, and rooted even in our very\r\n    soil, that a slave, or a negro, the moment he lands in England,\r\n    falls under the protection of the laws, and so far becomes a\r\n    freeman, though the master's right to his service may possibly\r\n    still continue.\r\n\r\n    Next to personal security, the law of England regards, asserts and\r\n    preserves the personal liberty of individuals. This personal\r\n    liberty consists in the power of locomotion, of changing\r\n    situation, or removing one's person to whatever place one's\r\n    inclinations may direct, without imprisonment or restraint, unless\r\n    by due course of law. Concerning which, we may make the same\r\n    observations as upon the preceding article; that it is a right\r\n    strictly natural; that the laws of England have never abridged it\r\n    without sufficient cause; and, that in this kingdom, it can never\r\n    be abridged at the mere discretion of the magistrate, without the\r\n    explicit permission of the laws.\"\r\n\r\nNow, let the reader examine and study these definitions of Liberty by\r\nPaley, Montesquieu and Blackstone, and he will see that they are in\r\npursuit of an ignis fatuus that eludes their grasp. He will see more,\r\nthat their liberty is a mere modification of slavery. That each of them\r\nproposes that degree of restraint, restriction and control, that will\r\nredound to the general good. That each is in pursuit of good government,\r\nnot liberty. Government pre-supposes that liberty is surrendered as the\r\nprice of security. The degree of government must depend on the moral\r\nand intellectual condition of those to be governed. Take, for instance,\r\nBlackstone's definition of civil liberty, and our negro slaves enjoy\r\nliberty, because the restrictions on their free will and free agency not\r\nonly redound to public good, but are really necessary to the protection\r\nand government of themselves. We mean to involve ourselves in no such\r\nabsurdities. Negroes, according to Blackstone, Paley and Montesquieu,\r\nalthough slaves, are free, because their liberty is only so far\r\nrestricted as the public interest and their own good require. Our theory\r\nis, that they are not free, because God and nature, and the general good\r\nand their own good, intended them for slaves. They enjoy all the rights\r\ncalculated to promote their own interests, or the public good. They are,\r\nat the South, well governed and well protected. These are the aims of\r\nall social institutions, and of all governments. There can be no liberty\r\nwhere there is government; but there may be security for good\r\ngovernment. This the slave has in the selfish interest of the master and\r\nin his domestic affection. The free laborer has no such securities. It\r\nis the interest of employers to kill them off as fast as possible; and\r\nthey never fail to do it.\r\n\r\nWe do not mean to say that the negro slave enjoys liberty. But we do say\r\nthat he is well and properly governed, so as best to promote his own\r\ngood and that of society. We do mean to say further, that what we have\r\nquoted from these great authors, is all fudge and nonsense. Liberty is\r\nunattainable; and if attainable, not desirable.\r\n\r\nLiberty of locomotion, which Blackstone boasts of as one of the rights\r\nof Englishmen, belongs to the mass of them less than to other people.\r\nFor five hundred years the poor laws have confined the poor to their\r\nparishes, denied them the right to bargain for their own wages, and as\r\nlate as 1725, set them up in stalls and shambles for hire, like cattle.\r\nLiberty in England, as in Rome and Greece, has been, and is now, the\r\nprivilege of the few--not the right of the many. But in Rome, Greece,\r\nand the Southern States of America, the many have gained in protection\r\nwhat they lost in liberty. In England, the masses have neither liberty\r\nnor protection. They are slaves without masters. This right of\r\nlocomotion, of choosing or changing their domicil, is not only denied to\r\nthe mass of the poor, but in all countries as well as in England, to\r\nwives, to children, to wards, apprentices, soldiers, sailors, convicts,\r\nlunatics and idiots. Take, then, this test of liberty, and how little of\r\nit is there in England! But, in fact, there is a very large nomadic\r\nclass of beggars, rogues, and journeymen workmen, who are always\r\nwandering, and yet, who are the most wretched members of society and its\r\ngreatest pests. So much for locomotion.\r\n\r\nGreat as the difficulty is to determine what is Liberty, to ascertain\r\nand agree on what constitutes Slavery is still greater. Slavery, in its\r\ntechnical form, has been almost universal, yet not exactly alike in all\r\nits circumstances and all its regulations in any two ages, or in any two\r\ncountries. In very many ancient States, the power of life and death was\r\nvested in the master. In most countries, the slave cannot acquire or\r\nhold property legally. In all, he holds more or less by the permission.\r\nIn many, his legal right to separate property is protected by law. Even\r\nin Cuba, he can compel his master to emancipate him, upon offering an\r\nadequate price; and in some cases of irreconcilable disagreement, force\r\nhis master to sell him to another master. It is remarkable at first\r\nview, that in Cuba, where the law attempts to secure mild treatment to\r\nthe slave, he is inhumanly treated; and in Virginia, where there is\r\nscarce any law to protect him, he is very humanely governed and provided\r\nfor. In Cuba, many of the slaves are savages, and do not elicit the\r\ndomestic affection of the master, who sees in them little more than\r\nbrutes. The master is, besides, often an absentee, and tho' overseers be\r\nfar more humane than Irish rent-collectors, they have neither the\r\ninterests nor feelings of resident masters. But the most efficient cause\r\nof cruelty and neglect, is the African slave trade, which makes it\r\ncheaper to buy than to rear slaves. In Virginia, the slaves have\r\nadvanced much in morality, religion and intelligence, and their masters\r\nand mistresses, living on the farm with them, naturally become attached\r\nto them. Self-interest, however, is everywhere the strongest motive to\r\nhuman conduct. Negroes are immensely valuable, and increase rapidly in\r\nvalue and in numbers when well treated. The law of self-interest secures\r\nkind and humane treatment to Southern slaves. All the legislative\r\ningenuity in the world will never enact so efficient a law in behalf of\r\nfree laborers.\r\n\r\nDuring the decline of the Roman Empire, slavery became colonial or\r\npraedial. The slaves occupied the place of tenants or serfs, were\r\n\"adscripti soli,\" and could only be sold with the farm. Many\r\nantiquarians consider the colonial slavery of the Romans as the true\r\norigin of the feudal system. This kind of slavery was universal in\r\nEurope till a few centuries since, and now prevails to a great extent.\r\nThe serfs of Russia, Poland, Turkey, and Hungary, are happier and better\r\nprovided for than the free laborers of Western Europe. They have homes,\r\nand lands to cultivate. They work but little, because their wants are\r\nfew and simple. They are not over-worked and under-fed, as are the free\r\nlaborers of Western Europe. Hence, they never rise in riots and\r\ninsurrections, burn houses, commit strikes,--nor do they emigrate.\r\n\r\nThis form of slavery, however, makes the master an idle absentee,\r\ndepriving the slaves of his guardianship, his government, and his\r\nprotection. By throwing large masses of the ignorant into exclusive\r\nassociation with each other, it promotes and increases ignorance,\r\nnegligence and idleness. Men will not improve their condition who have\r\nno examples to emulate and no teachers to instruct. Were their farms\r\nconducted as ours of the South, the wealthy would have ample employment,\r\nand the slaves or serfs find in their masters examples, governors,\r\nteachers and protectors.\r\n\r\nThe right to sell one's children, or one's self, into slavery has been\r\nvery common, and is now practiced in China. The ancient Germans used to\r\neven stake their liberty at games of hazard. This would never have been\r\ndone, nor would the laws have permitted it, if the situation of the\r\nslave had been greatly inferior to that of the free. But how shall we\r\nclass wives, children, wards, apprentices, prisoners, soldiers and\r\nsailors? They are not free, because their personal liberty is controlled\r\nby the will of a superior; not by mere law. They are liable to\r\nconfinement and punishment by their superiors, whose will stands in\r\nplace of law as to them. They have no right of locomotion like that\r\nenjoyed by the free. They have no liberty secured by law;--they are not\r\nfree. Are they, therefore, slaves?\r\n\r\nPaley defines slavery to be, \"An obligation to labor for the benefit of\r\nthe master, without the contract or consent of the servant.\" The sick,\r\nthe superannuated, the infirm, and the infant slaves are under no such\r\nobligation in theory or practice. The master is under an obligation,\r\nlegally, theoretically and practically, to labor for them. Therefore,\r\nthe master of twenty slaves is always a slave himself. If he be a good\r\nman, he is the happier for performing his duties as slave to those\r\nclasses of his slaves. But what becomes of that slavery of the ancients\r\nand of China, where the slave, by actual contract, sells himself? This\r\nis not slavery according to Paley.\r\n\r\nThe great and glaring defect, however, of Paley's definition is, that he\r\nomits the obligation on the master to provide for and protect the slave.\r\n'Tis but half of a definition, and that half false. It does often happen\r\nthat the _obligations_ of the master are more onerous than those of the\r\nslave. Yet Paley omits those obligations altogether. The slave, when\r\ncapable to do so, must work for the master; but the master, at all\r\ntimes, must provide for the slave. If incapable of doing so, the law\r\ngives the slave a new master and protector. His situation is less\r\nhonorable, but far more secure than that of the master. Definitions are\r\nperilous attempts. We never read one that a seventy-four with all sail\r\nset might not drive through. We shall define nothing ourselves, for we\r\nknow that this is the business of Omnipotence, that alone knows \"all\r\nthings in heaven and on earth.\"\r\n\r\nWe proceed to examine the attempted definitions of Montesquieu and\r\nBlackstone. Blackstone objects to the right to sell one's self, that the\r\nconsideration enures to the buyer. This may or may not be so, according\r\nto the laws of the State where the contract is made. It is not a\r\nnecessary feature of slavery, and cannot fairly be employed as an\r\nobjection to it. In fact, the slaves of the South, in their houses,\r\ngardens, fruit, vegetables, pigs and fowls, hold more property than the\r\npeasantry of Europe, and are far better secured in its possession by\r\ntheir masters, than that peasantry is by the law. He further objects,\r\nthat in case of absolute slavery, not only the liberty, but the life of\r\nthe slave is at the master's disposal. This objection is false and\r\npuerile. In no civilized country has the master the right to kill his\r\nslave.\r\n\r\nThe protection or support to which the slave is entitled, would be an\r\nample consideration of itself for the sale of his liberty. A much larger\r\none than the capitalists of Europe would be willing to give; for they\r\nall say that free labor is cheapest.\r\n\r\nMontesquieu thus defines slavery:--\"Slavery, properly so called, is the\r\nestablishment of a right which gives to one man such a power over\r\nanother, as renders him absolute master of his life and fortune.\" This\r\nis French liberty under the rule of the republican Bonapartes, and\r\nEnglish liberty under Cromwell--not Southern slavery. France is always\r\nhappy and prosperous with a master, and the masses in England look back\r\nto the Protectorate with fond regret. These despots played the part of\r\nSouthern masters. They forced the strong to support the weak, the rich\r\nto take care of the poor. The nations became two farms or families.\r\nWestern Europe will soon have to choose between domestic slavery and\r\nuniversal slavery.\r\n\r\nDemocracy and liberty are antagonistic; for liberty permits and\r\nencourages the weak to oppress the strong, whilst democracy proposes, so\r\nfar as possible, to equalize advantages, by fairly dividing the burdens\r\nof life, and rigidly enforcing the performance of every social duty by\r\nevery member of society, according to his capacity and ability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPALEY ON EXPLOITATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPaley maintains, to its fullest extent, the doctrine of exploitation\r\nwhich we have endeavored to expound and illustrate in the last three\r\nchapters. Yet, neither Paley nor any of his readers were ever aware of\r\nits tremendous consequences. It is only when those consequences are\r\npointed out, that the mind revolts at the theory.\r\n\r\nHe saw and said, that capital paid labor nothing, yet discovered no\r\niniquity in the transaction. He saw that labor produced every\r\nthing--capital nothing, and \"all that the capitalist does is, to\r\ndistribute what others produce.\" He should have added, after retaining\r\nthe \"lion's share\" himself. Our whole theory is to be found in a single\r\nparagraph of Paley, and if there be nothing strange or monstrous in his\r\ntheory, there can be nothing of the kind in ours; for our theories are\r\nidentical. Chapter 2, Book 3d of his philosophy, under the head of \"The\r\ntreatment of our domestics and dependants,\" he employs the following\r\nlanguage: \"Another reflection of a like tendency with the former is,\r\nthat our obligation to them is much greater than theirs to us. It is a\r\nmistake to suppose that the rich man maintains his servants, tradesmen,\r\ntenants and laborers: the truth is, they maintain him. It is their\r\nindustry which supplies his table, furnishes his wardrobe, builds his\r\nhouses, adorns his equipage, provides his amusements. It is not the\r\nestate, but the labor employed on it, that pays his rents. _All that he\r\ndoes is, to distribute what others produce; which is the least part of\r\nthe business._\" He should have added, \"but far the most profitable\r\npart.\"\r\n\r\nA few additional truths, and this paragraph of Paley's would be an\r\nadmirable description of \"Cannibals\" above, and \"Slaves without\r\nMasters,\" below.\r\n\r\nHis servants are obliged to work as our slaves, not for pay, but for an\r\nallowance out of the proceeds of their own labor. His employers, like\r\nour masters, only distribute something of their earnings to the\r\nlaborers, giving them far less than masters give to slaves, retaining\r\nmore to themselves--and hence \"free labor is cheaper than slave labor.\"\r\n\r\nBut Paley did not comprehend what he wrote. We, aided by the Socialists,\r\nwill try to make it understood by others.\r\n\r\nPhilosophy cannot justify the relation between the free laborer, and the\r\nidle, irresponsible employer. But, 'tis easy to justify that between\r\nmaster and slave. Their obligations are mutual and equal; and if the\r\nmaster will superintend and provide for the slave in sickness, in\r\nhealth, infancy and old age--if he will feed and clothe, and house him\r\nproperly, guard his morals, and treat him kindly and humanely, he will\r\nmake his slaves happy and profitable, and be himself a worthy, useful\r\nand conscientious man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOUR BEST WITNESSES AND MASTERS IN THE ART OF WAR.\r\n\r\n      I think few worth damnation, save their kings;\r\n      And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to\r\n      Assert my right as lord.\r\n\r\n                                     VISION OF JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe intend this chapter as our trump card, and have kept it in reserve,\r\nbecause it is rash to \"lead trumps.\" We could produce a cloud of\r\nwitnesses, but should only protract the trial thereby. We call into\r\ncourt Horace Greely, Wm. Goodell, Gerrit Smith, Wm. Lloyd Garrison, and\r\nStephen Pearle Andrews, and propose to prove by them (the actual leaders\r\nand faithful exponents of abolition,) that their object, and that of\r\ntheir entire party, is not only to abolish Southern slavery, but to\r\nabolish also, or greatly to modify, the relations of husband and wife,\r\nparent and child, the institution of private property of all kinds, but\r\nespecially separate ownership of lands, and the institution of Christian\r\nchurches as now existing in America. We further charge, that whilst\r\nactively engaged in attempts to abolish Southern slavery, they are busy,\r\nwith equal activity and more promise of success, in attempts to upset\r\nand re-organize society at the North.\r\n\r\nIn convening these gentlemen as witnesses, and also arraigning them\r\non trial, we are actuated by no feelings of personal ill-will or\r\ndisrespect. We admire them all, and have had kindly intercourse and\r\ncorrespondence with some of them. They are historical characters, who\r\nwould seek notoriety in order to further their schemes of setting the\r\nworld to rights. We have no doubt of their sincere philanthropy, and as\r\nlittle doubt, that they are only \"paving hell with good intentions.\"\r\nWe speak figuratively. We shall try their cause in the most calm and\r\njudicial temper. We would address each of them in language borrowed from\r\nLord Byron:\r\n\r\n                                      Why,\r\n  My good old friend, for such I deem you,\r\n  Though our different parties make us fight so shy,\r\n  I ne'er mistake you for a _personal_ foe;\r\n  Our difference is political, and I\r\n  Trust that whatever may occur,\r\n  You know my great respect for you, and this\r\n  Makes me regret whatever you do amiss.\r\n\r\nIndeed, we should be ungrateful and discourteous in the extreme, if we\r\ndid not entertain kindly remembrance and make gentlemanly return for the\r\ngenerous reception and treatment we received, especially from leading\r\nabolitionists, when we went north to personate Satan by defending\r\nSlavery. Though none agreed with us, none were made converts by us:\r\n\r\n  Yet still between his darkness and his brightness,\r\n  There passed a mutual glance of great politeness.\r\n\r\nWe will first call Mr. Wm. Goodell to the stand. His position as one of\r\nthe most active leaders of the Gerrit Smith or Syracuse wing of\r\nabolition, would entitle his admissions and assertions of the failure of\r\nhis own society to the greatest credence, since such admissions and\r\nassertions weaken his assaults on the South, and must be reluctantly\r\ndrawn from him; but, independent of his peculiar position, his high\r\ncharacter as a man, and his distinction as an author, should enlist\r\nattention and command respect for what he says. In his Democracy of\r\nChristianity, vol. 2d, page 197, he thus writes:\r\n\r\n    \"And what is this pride of wealth, after all, growing up into the\r\n    aristocracy of wealth, the usurpations of wealth, the oppressions\r\n    of wealth, grinding the masses of humanity into the dust to-day,\r\n    throughout our modern Christendom, in the middle of our nineteenth\r\n    century civilization and progress, with a hoof more flinty, more\r\n    swinish, and MORE MURDEROUS (capitals ours) than that of\r\n    semi-barbarous feudalism in its bloodiest days.\"\r\n\r\nHe understands the intolerable exploitation of capital better than we\r\ndo, for he lives in a country where slavery has not stepped in to shield\r\nthe laborer. He, the laborer, is a \"slave without a master,\" and his\r\noppressors, \"cannibals all.\"\r\n\r\nMr. G's. book appears to us to carry the doctrine of human equality to a\r\nlength utterly inconsistent with the power and control which ordinary\r\nChristian marriage gives to the husband over the wife; yet be assures us\r\nhe is the unflinching friend of Christian marriage. The purity of his\r\nsentiments revolt at the conclusions to which his abstract doctrines\r\ninevitably lead. Yet his idea of Christian marriage may differ, so far\r\nas the power of the husband is concerned, widely from ours. We are sure\r\nhe would do nothing, designedly, to impair the purity and sacredness of\r\nthe relation.\r\n\r\nMr. G. is a Christian socialist, and looks to a proximate millenium to\r\nrectify the false relations of men and property, in his own society, and\r\nto the arm of the Federal Government to set things right in the South.\r\nWhy not leave all to Providence, especially since the right of the\r\nGovernment to abolish Southern slavery is denied by all respectable\r\nauthority outside of abolition; and also by the Garrisonians, who are\r\nthe most thorough-going of all abolitionists, and of all disorganizers.\r\nMr. Goodell's plan of \"rectifying human relations\" at the North, by a\r\nmillennium, is quite as common as that of Mr. Greely, Andrews and Owen,\r\neach of whom has discovered a new social science that they are sure will\r\nfit the world, because it wont fit a village.\r\n\r\nWe really think that a man of Mr. Goodell's nice sense of justice and\r\npropriety, should have hesitated long ere he invoked a God to do that\r\nwhich he would be ashamed to do himself. If it be wrong to strip the\r\nrich of their possessions, why hope or expect that God will perpetrate a\r\nwrong at which human conscience revolts, when it is proposed to be done\r\nby human agency.\r\n\r\nAfter an elaborate argument, to prove the advent of a millennial state\r\nof society, through the instrumentality of Christianity, Mr. Goodell, on\r\npage 510, vol. II, of his Democracy of Christianity, thus sums up and\r\nconcludes:\r\n\r\n    \"Glance over, again, the items included in these predictions:--The\r\n    general and permanent prevalence of peace,--the result of justice,\r\n    _equity_, SECURITY, and the actual _possession_, [italics his] by\r\n    each and every one of 'his vine and fig tree'--that is, of soil\r\n    sufficient to produce the needful fruits of the earth, or, in some\r\n    way, a supply for his physical wants.\r\n\r\n    \"Add to this, the general diffusion and great increase of\r\n    knowledge, especially moral and religious knowledge, which\r\n    includes the knowledge of social relations, duties and\r\n    rights,--the knowledge that implies 'wisdom,' and that wisdom\r\n    which begins with 'the fear of the Lord.' Next the application of\r\n    all this knowledge, wisdom and fear of the Lord, to the concerns\r\n    of civil government, insomuch that 'the kingdoms of this world\r\n    shall become the kingdoms of Christ,' and the dominion be given to\r\n    THE PEOPLE, who at that period, shall have become purified and\r\n    instructed by him,--who shall all be righteous, who 'shall all\r\n    know the Lord, from the least to the greatest,' and even 'the\r\n    feeble among them shall be as David.' To this, add general\r\n    contentment and enjoyment, facilities of social and international\r\n    intercourse, the general prevalence of the spirit of benevolence\r\n    and brotherly love, and the absence of those maddening and satanic\r\n    temptations, delusions and prejudices, that have so long deceived,\r\n    enslaved and embroiled the nations;--all this cemented by the true\r\n    spiritual worship, protection and love of the Common Father of all\r\n    men.\r\n\r\n    \"Is any thing wanting to complete the picture, and to ratify the\r\n    assurance of a state of liberty, equality, common brotherhood,\r\n    common interests, common sympathy, and common participancy in\r\n    social rights, immunities, privileges and arrangements? Must we\r\n    need be told in addition to all this, that 'the thrones of\r\n    despotism shall be cast down,' that the 'beast' of civil and\r\n    ecclesiastical tyranny and usurpation, the persecutor 'of the holy\r\n    apostles and people,' shall be given 'to the burning flames,' that\r\n    the yoke of domination 'shall be dashed into pieces as a potter's\r\n    vessel,' that 'subversion' shall tread upon the heels of\r\n    subversion, and one despotism overturn another, till He, 'whose\r\n    right it is, shall rule.' That the masses shall be elevated, the\r\n    exclusives brought low, that the 'lofty' shall be 'humbled,' and\r\n    the 'haughty bowed down'--_in such a period of general possession,\r\n    general justice, equality and contentment as has been already and\r\n    previously described_?\"\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Goodell deplores that the condition of his society is so bad,\r\nthat it becomes necessary to upset and reverse it by a millennium. Is\r\nnot this, considering his high position and authority, strong evidence\r\nto prove \"the failure of Free Society.\" We should add, that his whole\r\nbook teems with evidence of his uncompromising hostility to existing\r\nChurch institutions, and the existing Priesthood, as abuses and\r\ninterpolations that have been engrafted improperly on Christianity. He\r\nobviously belongs, in faith, to those early Christians, who resembled\r\nthe Essenes in their social relations, and who daily expected the advent\r\nof the millennium. Their error in the last respect, shows that it is the\r\nBible, and not their construction of it, that should be our rule of\r\nfaith and guide of conduct.\r\n\r\nThe next witness we call up, is Gerrit Smith, a man who has a national\r\nreputation as an orator, a philanthropist and a gentleman; who writes\r\nbetter than he speaks, and whose active charity and benevolence are only\r\nexceeded in the greatness of their amount by the grossness of their\r\nmisapplication. He is a zealous Christian, yet edits, or did edit, the\r\nProgressive Christian, which proposed to abolish Christianity as now\r\nunderstood. He builds churches to keep out the clergy, and heads\r\nChristian conventions to put down Christian institutions, and agrees\r\nwith Wendell Phillips, that the pulpit of the North stands in the way\r\nof reform--_et delenda est Carthago_--the pulpit should be destroyed!\r\n\r\nLike Mr. Goodell, he seems to look to an approaching millenium. But he\r\nis a man of restless activity and energy, and of incalculable daring,\r\nand would put his shoulder to the wheel, and inaugurate the millenium at\r\nonce. He assumes the responsibility; declares continually in speeches,\r\nlectures and essays, that land monopoly is an intolerable evil; that\r\nlands should be as common and as free for use to all, as air and water;\r\nand proposes to divide them at once. He is one of the largest owners of\r\nreal estate at the North, and yet the most uncompromising agrarian in\r\nthe world. His disinterestedness is only exceeded by his rashness and\r\ndestructiveness:\r\n\r\n  \"The mildest-manner'd man,\r\n  That ever cut a throat or scuttled ship.\"\r\n\r\nHis amiableness of disposition and evenness of temper never desert him,\r\nbecause he has not to \"screw his courage to the sticking-place.\" 'Tis\r\nalways there. The \"red right arm of Thundering Jove\" could not shake his\r\ntenacity of purpose; and, in a case of conscience, he would let the\r\nworld or the Union slide with equal equanimity:\r\n\r\n  \"Si fractus illabitur orbis,\r\n  Impavidum ferient ruinae!\"\r\n\r\nHe gives a forty thousand or so to Kansas emigrants from the North,\r\nbecause, as a gentleman, he feels it his duty to stick to his country,\r\nright or wrong; and abolitionists are _his_ country. His gross\r\neccentricities and intellectual aberrations are but the natural\r\nout-growth of the social system which surrounds him, and which reminds\r\nhim and every other ingenuous and candid mind,\r\n\r\n  \"That whatever is, is _wrong_.'\"\r\n\r\nHe is only seemingly eccentric and erratic. He feels the difficulty of\r\ndisposing of his immense wealth, without making it an engine of\r\noppression and exaction. He understands the theory of capital and labor,\r\nas his speeches show;--knows that labor produces every thing, and that\r\ncapital is the whip that forces it to work, and also the exploitator\r\nthat robs it of most of the proceeds of its industry. \"La propriete\r\nc'est le vol!\" he sees is true, save in the impurity of motive, which it\r\nseems to attribute to its owners. If he endows colleges, or gives his\r\nmoney in large sums to individuals, in the one case it is used to rear\r\nup exploitators, who rob labor by professional skill; and in the other,\r\nto those who use it at once as an engine of exaction and oppression. If\r\nhe gives it in smaller sums to the poor, he is generally giving to the\r\nidle the labor of the industrious, and offering a premium to continued\r\nidleness; for he can neither control the conduct nor expenditure of his\r\nbeneficiaries. He is too good, and too proud, to spend his income in\r\npomp and luxury. Too good thus to waste the proceeds of labor, (as all\r\npublic or private luxury does,) and thus increase the burdens of the\r\nworking class. Too proud to derive reflected importance and standing\r\nfrom extraneous glitter and costly show and equipage. He has (no doubt,\r\nin vain,) attempted to ameliorate the condition of a great many slaves,\r\nby purchasing them and emancipating them. Could he retain them as\r\nslaves, he might see that his charity was not misapplied, by educating\r\nthem and controlling their conduct. To us, it occurs that a large\r\ncapital can only be safely invested in slaves and hands, if the owner\r\nwishes to be sure that it shall not be used as an engine of oppression,\r\nor as a persuasive to idleness and dissipation.\r\n\r\nWe should do injustice to Mr. Smith were we not to add, that he is quite\r\nas busy in abducting negroes as in buying them. The underground railroad\r\nis one of his favorite pets and beneficiaries. His restless energy is\r\nnot satisfied with the slow proceedings of this road, and hence he buys\r\nnegroes, as well as aids the abducting of them. He has been severely\r\ncensured for buying them, by those whom he supplies with the means to\r\nsteal them, or whom he rescues from the fangs of the law, when caught\r\nin abortive efforts to abduct them.\r\n\r\nHe had the education and has the feelings and bearing of the Southerner.\r\nHis father owned slaves, and a territory full of Indians, and he was\r\nreared as playmate and prince in their midst; hence, he has the proud\r\nhumility of the Southerner, not the exacting and supercilious arrogance\r\nof the Northerner. He does not demand deference and respect, because it\r\nhas, from boyhood, been yielded to him, as his due, by admitted\r\ninferiors.\r\n\r\nThe value of his testimony, establishing, if true, the utter and entire\r\nfailure of free society, cannot be over estimated. He is learned,\r\ncandid, honest, well-informed, and has always lived in free society. Its\r\nsubversion, which he proposes, and actively attempts, would strip him of\r\nmillions of wealth. He is the leading champion of slave abolition, and,\r\nby admitting the failure of free society, blunts and neutralizes all his\r\narguments against slavery. In every way, then, pride of opinion, seeming\r\nconsistency, and pecuniary interest, tempt him to extol, not to condemn\r\nfree society. It is true, he thinks slavery also a failure, and a\r\ngreater failure; but he knows little practically about slave society,\r\nand cannot admit for us, although he may for himself and his\r\nsection.--En passant, we would say to him, that air and water are the\r\nsubjects of more exclusive appropriation in free society than land.--He\r\nis a lawyer, and knows that the ownership of the soil carries with it\r\nthe ownership of every thing, ad inferos, et usque ad coelum. In fact,\r\nin cities where the poor most do congregate, their food and raiment\r\ndiffer not half so much from that of the rich, as their enjoyment of\r\npure air and water. Men must get a place to breathe and drink from; and\r\nall places are appropriated.\r\n\r\nYes, Mr. Smith, you are vainly trying to grasp The Right! The Right is\r\nconnected with, affected by, and affects all the Past, all the Present,\r\nand all the Future. God knows the Right--man only the Expedient.\r\n\r\nOur next witness is Horace Greely, Editor of the Tribune, and Napoleon\r\nof the Press. His first distinction was won by his espousing and\r\nelaborately propagating the Social Philosophy of Charles Casimir\r\nFourier. This he did, some twenty years since, in a long controversy\r\nwith the Courier & Enquirer: the latter paper sustaining the\r\nconservative side. The correspondence was afterwards published in book\r\nform, and we regret that we have not been able to possess ourselves of a\r\ncopy. The whole edition, we learn, was burnt at the Harpers. Consigned\r\nby Providence, not by a human Censor, to the flames. Should we\r\nmisrepresent our witness, it will be because we have tried in vain to\r\nget this book. We think he was the first, in America, to assert, and\r\nmaintain by arguments and proofs, the inadequacy and injustice of the\r\nwhole social and governmental organization at the North. He, not\r\nourselves, is the American author of the theory of the Failure of Free\r\nSociety. His remedies, though not as radical and scientific as those of\r\nProudhon and Mr. Andrews, did very well for a beginning. He, we think,\r\nproposed at once to coop mankind up in Phalansteries, where, in a few\r\ngenerations, all the distinctions of separate property, and of separate\r\nwives and children, would be obliterated and lost, and society would\r\ngradually and gently be fused and crystalized into a system of pure and\r\nperfect Communism. The Tribune has to minister to a variety of tastes,\r\nall agreeing in their destructive tendencies, but differing widely as to\r\nthe manner in which they shall attain their conclusions; hence, it is\r\nhard to deduce any well defined system of philosophy from its columns.\r\nMr. Andrews intimates, that our witness is no philosopher at all. Be it\r\nso. Yet all must admit that no man of the age has the organ or faculty\r\nof Destructiveness so fully developed. The Tribune has been, from the\r\ntime of the controversy of which we have spoken, to the present day, the\r\ngreat Organ of Socialism, of Free Love, and of all the other isms which\r\npropose to overthrow and rebuild society and government, or to dispense\r\nwith them altogether. Steadily pursuing this destructive course, the\r\nTribune has for years become the most popular paper in the North, and,\r\n'tis said, has more readers in Europe and America than any paper in the\r\nworld; and yet its only peculiar thought, its whole intellectual, moral,\r\nsocial and political stock in trade, consists of the one idea, variously\r\nexpressed, illustrated and enforced, \"The Failure of Free Society;\" or,\r\nas Carlyle phrases it, \"We must have a new world, if we are to have any\r\nworld at all.\"\r\n\r\nWhat a striking illustration of our theory, that \"a mere verbal formula\r\noften distinguishes a truism from a paradox.\" _We_ assert a theory\r\nbluntly and plainly, and attempt to prove it by facts and arguments, and\r\nthe world is ready to exclaim, \"Oh, what shocking heresy.\" Mr. Greely,\r\nfor twenty years, maintains the same theory, in different language, and\r\nelicits the admiration and gratitude of the world. Oh, Le Pauvre Peuple!\r\nhow long will it permit its flatterers to deceive and betray it? Mr.\r\nGreely and ourselves agree in our destructive philosophy, but are wide\r\nasunder as the poles in what is constructive. Each proposes to protect\r\nthe weak. He promises \"protection without control or abridgment of\r\nliberty.\" We tell those who ask for or require protection and support,\r\nthat \"they must submit to be controlled, for that the price of security\r\nhas ever been, and ever will be, the loss of liberty.\"\r\n\r\nThe popularity of the Tribune shews that the world is prepared to upset\r\nexisting social systems. When that is done, it will have to choose\r\nbetween Free Love and Slavery; between more of government and no\r\ngovernment. We think, like Carlyle, more of government is needed. We,\r\ntoo, are a Socialist, (for free society,) but we would screw up the\r\nstrings of society, not further relax them, much less cut them \"sheer\r\nasunder!\"\r\n\r\nWe wish to display the truth, and nothing but truth, to the public, on\r\nthe subjects of Abolition and Socialism; and, for fear of\r\nmisrepresentation, have written letters to Mr. Greely and Mr. Garrison,\r\ncopies of which we shall append to this chapter. Should they be silent,\r\nthe letters will at least show our solicitude to arrive at truth.\r\n\r\nWe have written enough about Mr. Andrews, and quoted enough from his\r\nbook already, to show that he is the great philosopher of his party, and\r\nthe comprehensive and truthful expositor of its doctrines, its\r\ntendencies, and ultimate results. His co-laborers, less scientific and\r\nfar-sighted than he, might be ready to exclaim, on reading his book,\r\n\"Thinkest thou thy servant a dog, that he shall do this thing!\" But Mr.\r\nAndrews is right. To this complexion must they come at last. A plunge\r\ninto the soft and sensual waters of the lake of Free Love--then a sudden\r\nand violent exit into the keen and shivering atmosphere of despotism.\r\n\r\nWe know less of Mr. Garrison than of either of the other gentlemen. He\r\nheads the extreme wing of the Socialist, Infidel, Woman's-Right,\r\nAgrarian and Abolition party, who are called Garrisonians. He edits the\r\nLiberator, which is conducted with an ability worthy of a better cause.\r\nHe and his followers seem to admit that the Bible and the Constitution\r\nrecognize and guarantee Slavery, and therefore denounce both, and\r\npropose disunion and no priests or churches, as measures to attain\r\nabolition. Mr. Garrison usually presides at their meetings, and we\r\ninfer, in part, their principles and doctrines, from the materials that\r\ncompose those meetings. A Wise-Woman will rise and utter a philipic\r\nagainst Marriage, the Bible, and the Constitution,--and will be followed\r\nby negro Remond, who \"spits upon Washington,\" and complains of the\r\ninvidious distinction of calling whites Anglo-Saxons, and negroes\r\nAfricans. And now, Phillips arises,\r\n\r\n  \"Armed with hell-flames and fury,\"\r\n\r\nand gently begins, in tones more dulcet, and with action more graceful\r\nthan Belial, to\r\n\r\n  \"Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell!\r\n  Uproar the universal peace--\r\n  Destroy all unity on earth.\"\r\n\r\nThen Mr. Parker will edify the meeting by stirring up to bloody deeds in\r\nKansas or in Boston--in which, as becomes his cloth, he takes no\r\npart--and ends by denouncing things in general, and the churches and\r\nparsons in particular. And, probably, the whole will conclude with a\r\ngeneral indulgence and remission of sins, from Mr. Andrews, who assumes,\r\nfor the nonce, the character of Father Confessor, and assures the tender\r\nconscience that it is right and incumbent to take the oath to sustain\r\nthe Constitution, with the deliberate purpose of violating it, because\r\nsuch oaths are taken under moral duress. These Garrisonians are as\r\nintellectual men as any in the nation. They lead the Black Republican\r\nparty, and control the politicians. Yet are they deadly enemies of\r\nNorthern as well as of Southern institutions.\r\n\r\nNow, gentlemen, all of you are philosophers, and most zealous\r\nphilanthropists, and have for years been roaring, at the top of your\r\nvoice, to the Oi Polloi rats, that the old crazy edifice of society, in\r\nwhich they live, is no longer fit for human dwelling, and is imminently\r\ndangerous. The rats have taken you at your word, and are rushing\r\nheadlong, with the haste and panic of a \"sauve que peut,\" into every\r\nhole that promises shelter--into \"any port in a storm.\" Some join the\r\nRappists and Shakers, thousands find a temporary shelter in Mr. Greely's\r\nFourierite Phalansteries; many more follow Mr. Andrews to Trialville, to\r\nvillages in the far West, or to Modern Times; and a select few to the\r\nsaloons of Free Love; and hundreds of thousands find shelter with\r\nBrigham Young, in Utah; whilst others, still more frightened, go to\r\nconsult the Spiritual Telegraph, that raps hourly at the doors of heaven\r\nand of hell, or quietly put on their ascension robes to accompany Parson\r\nMiller in his upward flight. But the greater number are waiting (very\r\nimpatiently) for Mr. Andrews to establish his New and Better World, or\r\nfor Mr. Garrison and Mr. Goodell to inaugurate their Millenium.\r\n\r\nWhy, Gentlemen! none of these worse than Cassandra vaticinations--why\r\nnone of this panic, terror, confusion and flight, in Slave Society? Are\r\nwe suffering, and yet contented? Is our house tumbling about our heads,\r\nand we sitting in conscious security amidst the impending ruin? No! No!\r\nOur edifice is one that never did fall, and never will fall; for\r\nNature's plastic hand reared it, supports it, and will forever sustain\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHave we not shewn, in this single chapter, that the North has as much to\r\napprehend from abolition as the South, and that it is time for\r\nconservatives every where to unite in efforts to suppress and extinguish\r\nit?\r\n\r\nWe add hereto a letter we addressed to the public as to \"Our Trip to the\r\nNorth,\" and our reply to a Mr. Hogeboom, a New York abolitionist. Also,\r\nour letters to Garrison and Greely. We do this to shew that we intend\r\nnot to mislead, misrepresent or deceive. In truth, the leading\r\nAbolitionists are our pets and favorites. We have an inveterate and\r\nperverse penchant of finding out good qualities in bad fellows.\r\nRobespierre and Milton's Satan are our particular friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nMY TRIP TO THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n_To the Editors of the Enquirer_:\r\n\r\nGENTLEMEN,--I hesitated long before resolving to address you this\r\nletter. I feel that I shall be amenable to the charge of egotism; but I\r\nhave written a book, in which I undertake to defend and justify Slavery,\r\nand to advise the South as to its future policy. In that I am\r\negotistical, as every one is who writes a book. I have \"stepped in so\r\nfar, that returning were more tedious than go o'er.\" I will not do\r\nthings by halves. When I wrote that book, I believed that Government,\r\nLaw, Religion, and Marriage, were victims bound and filleted for\r\nsacrifice by Northern abolition. What was then matter of doubtful\r\nopinion, inference and speculation, has become, since my trip to the\r\nNorth, subject of fixed faith and conviction. I enjoyed the warm and\r\nelegant hospitality of some of the Liberty party of the North. I was in\r\nsocial intercourse with many of them. I have received many pamphlets,\r\nbooks and speeches from them. I have no private confidences to betray,\r\nbecause I heard no secrets. This party is conscientious, believes itself\r\nright, and courts discussion and notoriety. I, besides, conversed\r\nfreely with strangers, in public conveyances and at hotels. I think,\r\nwith my previous study on the subject of Slavery and Abolition, I may be\r\nable to make some useful suggestions to the South and the North.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me, that in attempting to prove \"Free Society a failure,\"\r\nin my lecture at New Haven, I was \"but carrying coals to New Castle.\"\r\nThe Liberty party, at least, discovered that long before I did, and are\r\nas intent on subverting and re-constructing society at home, as on\r\nabolishing slavery with us. A part of them, I will not undertake to say\r\nhow large a portion, are infidels, who find the Bible no impediment to\r\ntheir schemes of social reform, because they assert that it is false.\r\nThis wing of the Liberty party is in daily expectation of discovering a\r\nnew Social Science, that will remedy all the ills that human flesh is\r\nheir to. They belong to the schools of Owen, Louis Blanc, Fourier,\r\nComte, and the German and French Socialists and Communists. The other\r\nwing, and probably the most numerous wing of the party, is composed of\r\nthe Millenial Christians--men who expect Christ, either in the flesh or\r\nin the spirit, soon to reign on earth; the lion to lie down with the\r\nlamb; every man to sit down under his own vine and fig tree; all to have\r\nan interest in lands; marrying and giving in marriage to cease; war to\r\nbe abolished, and peace and good will to reign among men. They are as\r\nintent on abolishing all Church government and authority, as the\r\ninfidels. They would, equally with them, trample on all law and\r\ngovernment, because \"liberty is,\" say they, \"an inalienable right,\" and\r\nlaw, religion, and government continue to protect slavery. Marriage,\r\nChristian marriage, which requires the obedience of the wife, is\r\nslavery; and they would modify it, or destroy it. Land monopoly, they\r\nsay, gives to property or capital a greater power over labor than\r\nmasters have over slaves; hence, they very wisely and logically\r\nconclude, that land, like air and water, should be common property.\r\n\r\nThe Liberty party is composed of very able men--of philosophers and\r\nphilanthropists. They have demonstrated, beyond a doubt, that slavery is\r\nnecessary, unless they can get up a Millenium, or discover a new Social\r\nScience. The increasing crime and poverty of mankind, and the utter\r\nfailure of all social experiments like those of Owen and others,\r\nindicate neither the advent of the one, nor the discovery of the other.\r\n\r\nThis Liberty party are the best allies of the South, because they admit,\r\nand continually expose, the utter failure of Free Society.\r\n\r\nOne of the most distinguished of this party thus writes to Wendell\r\nPhillips, Esq.:\r\n\r\n    \"I cannot refrain from expressing, in this connection, my grief\r\n    that many abolitionists have allowed their faith in the Bible to\r\n    be shaken.\"\r\n\r\nIn my short trip to the North, I was struck with nothing so much as the\r\navowed infidelity of many, and the Christianity melting into infidelity,\r\nof the great mass of the balance with whom I conversed. I have no doubt,\r\nhowever, that although such a state of things is too common at the\r\nNorth, yet my peculiar associations made the evil appear greater than it\r\nreally is. The religious and conservative, like the lily of the valley,\r\nare silent and secluded. As a specimen of this religion melting, as I\r\nthink, into infidelity, I will give another extract from the letter to\r\nWendell Phillips:\r\n\r\n    \"You have been much censured for holding that the anti-slavery\r\n    cause can reach success only over the ruins of the American\r\n    government and the American church. Nevertheless, you are right.\r\n    The religion which tolerates--nay, sanctifies--slavery, must\r\n    necessarily be conquered ere the devotees and dupes of that\r\n    religion will suffer slavery to be abolished. Again, so long as\r\n    the actual government is on the side of slavery, the bloodless\r\n    abolition of slavery is impracticable.\"\r\n\r\nThe author of the letter from which I quote, and Mr. Phillips to whom it\r\nis addressed, are gentlemen, scholars and christians. They are, besides,\r\nhistorical characters. We violate no privacy in holding up their\r\nopinions to public view and general criticism. Is their's not\r\nChristianity melting into infidelity? I have lately received a book, in\r\ntwo volumes, entitled \"The Democracy of Christianity,\" from its\r\nauthor--William Goodell of New York, a member of the Liberty Party. The\r\nauthor evinces much ability, ingenuity and research. He is one of the\r\nmillenial Christians--obviously pious and sincere. He sees no exodus\r\nfrom the appalling evils of Free Society, except that state of perfect\r\nequality, peace, happiness and security, that he, like the men of\r\nCromwell's day, thinks is promised and predicted in the Bible. I cite\r\nthe following passage from the conclusion of his work:\r\n\r\n    \"Glance over again the items included in these predictions:--The\r\n    general and permanent prevalence of peace--the result of justice,\r\n    equity, security, and the actual possession, by each and every\r\n    one, of 'his vine and fig tree,' i. e. of soil sufficient to\r\n    produce the needful fruits of the earth, or in some way, a supply\r\n    of his physical wants.\"\r\n\r\nIf this state of things ever occur, God will bring it about without the\r\nhelp of abolitionists.\r\n\r\nWe do not deem it necessary to quote from the infidel agrarians and\r\nabolitionists, because their splendid promises and bloody and disastrous\r\nfailures, have been matters of every day's history and of every day's\r\noccurrence, from the times of Marat and the guillotine to those of\r\nLamartine and Cavaignac.\r\n\r\nThe Proletariat of France, the nomadic pauper banditti of England, the\r\nstarving tenantry of Ireland, the Lazzaroni of Italy, and the\r\nhalf-savages of Hayti, are the admitted results of practical abolition.\r\nBut, say the Liberty party, abolition has stopped half-way; abolish\r\nchurches, law, government, marriage, and separate property in lands, and\r\nthen the scheme will work charmingly.\r\n\r\nWell, possibly it will; but as we are very happy, comfortable and\r\ncontented in slave society, suppose you try the \"experimentum in vile\r\ncorpus.\" Begin at home, and if the experiment works well, we of the\r\nSouth will follow your example. You have a little Eden now near Lake\r\nOneida. Some hundreds of Oneida perfectionists, living in primitive\r\nsimplicity, among whom there is no \"marrying or giving in marriage,\" no\r\nseparate property, all things enjoyed in common; and we suppose, neither\r\npriest nor officer to disturb or mar the harmony of millenial society.\r\n\"We but tell the tale as 'twas told to us.\" Does it work well? If so,\r\nwhy not form all your institutions on that model?\r\n\r\nYou of the Liberty party seem to think that \"passional attraction\" and\r\n\"attractive labor\" will keep all men up to their duties, and dispense\r\nwith the necessity of Church and State, Law and Religion, Priest and\r\nOfficer. You think you follow nature, but in truth you are superficial\r\nobservers of nature. Man, it is true, is a social and gregarious animal,\r\nbut like all animals of that kind, he is, by nature, law-making and\r\nlaw-abiding. The ants and bees are ruled by despotic and exacting\r\ngovernments, and by laws and regulations, wise and less changeable than\r\nthose of the Medes and Persians. But man is not only a law-making\r\nanimal, but a religious one also. In remitting him to a state of anarchy\r\nand infidelity, you would not remit him to a state of nature, but one of\r\ncontinuous, exterminating warfare, such as France witnessed during the\r\nreign of terror.\r\n\r\nI find, Messrs. Editors, that I am somewhat wandering from the subject\r\nwith which I commenced, and will conclude--for the present, at least.\r\n\r\n                        Very respectfully, your ob't serv't.\r\n\r\n                                                              G. F.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR. HOGEBOOM.\r\n\r\n                                 _Port Royal_, Va., Jan. 14th, 1856.\r\n\r\nTo A. HOGEBOOM, Esq., Sheds Corners, Madison county, N. Y.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR:--Your letter reached this office during my absence from home.\r\nI embrace the earliest opportunity of replying to it, because I rejoice\r\nthat public attention at the North may, by this means, be excited to the\r\nsubject of my book. I am sure I should not have been honored with your\r\ncorrespondence had you read the book and known its subject. That subject\r\nis the \"Failure of Free Society.\" You have only read extracts from it,\r\nyou say, in the Northern papers. Those papers will be slow to notice the\r\nfacts, authorities and admissions which it cites, to prove the failure\r\nof their form of society. I send you the book and refer you particularly\r\nto the preface, to the second and third chapters, and to the \"summing\r\nup\" in the concluding chapter.\r\n\r\nIf this does not satisfy you that free society is a cruel failure, read\r\nthe history of the English Poor laws, and you will find that the\r\nlaboring class of England have, every day since the emancipation of the\r\nvilleins, been in a worse condition, morally and physically, than any\r\nslaves ever were. Read, also, two articles, the one in the North British\r\nReview, and the other in Blackwood for December, depicting the\r\ndemoralized and starving condition of the whole laboring class of Great\r\nBritain. Read, also, Carlyle's Latter Day Pamphlets. If this does not\r\nconvince you that the _Little Experiment_, (for it is a very little one,\r\nboth in time and space,) is a disastrous and cruel failure, look at\r\nhome! How comes it that your distinguished neighbor, Gerrit Smith,\r\nproposes to make land as free for the enjoyment of all as air and water?\r\nConfessedly, because the despotism of capital over labor is\r\n_intolerable_. Confessedly, because your form of society is found to be\r\na failure in practice! Why does another distinguished abolitionist, Mr.\r\nGoodell, of New York, in his book, on the Democracy of Christianity,\r\ndeclare, that wealth now is more cruel, oppressive and _murderous_,\r\nthan Feudal masters? Why does Mr. Greely advocate the doctrines of\r\nFourier, and propose to subvert your society and reconstruct it from top\r\nto bottom, making a sort of common property of women and children, as\r\nwell as of lands and houses? Why does, much your ablest philosopher,\r\nStephen Pearle Andrews, propose plans of reform still more sweeping?\r\nAnd, why are his doctrines popular with the \"higher classes\" in New\r\nYork? Why, in fine, are the larger number of the abolitionists,\r\nmillenial Christians, in daily expectation of the advent of Christ, who\r\nis to divide all property equally, and give to each one his \"vine and\r\nfig tree.\" And why are the others, Atheists, like Owen and Fourier,\r\nattempting to invent new and better forms of society?\r\n\r\nWhy have you Bloomer's and Women's Right's men, and strong-minded women,\r\nand Mormons, and anti-renters, and \"vote myself a farm\" men, Millerites,\r\nand Spiritual Rappers, and Shakers, and Widow Wakemanites, and\r\nAgrarians, and Grahamites, and a thousand other superstitious and\r\ninfidel isms at the North? Why is there faith in nothing, speculation\r\nabout everything? Why is this unsettled, half demented state of the\r\nhuman mind co-extensive in time and space, with free society? Why is\r\nWestern Europe now starving? and why has it been fighting and starving\r\nfor seventy years? Why all this, except that free society is a failure?\r\nSlave society needs no defence till some other permanently practicable\r\nform of society has been discovered. None such has been discovered.\r\nNobody at the North who reads my book will attempt to reply to it; for\r\nall the learned abolitionists had unconsciously discovered and\r\nproclaimed the failure of free society long before I did.\r\n\r\nI am indebted for the honor of your correspondence, to your ignorance of\r\nwhat my book contains. I reply through the Press, because I intend to\r\nuse your letter merely as an occasion to challenge the North, to dispute\r\nor deny my assertion that \"free society is a failure!\"\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I propose to you, and through you to the whole North,\r\nthese questions.\r\n\r\nDo not the past history and present condition of Free Society in Western\r\nEurope (where alone the experiment has been fully tried,) prove that it\r\nis attended with greater evils, moral and physical, than Slave Society?\r\n\r\nDo not the late writers on society in Western Europe, and in our free\r\nStates, generally admit that those evils are intolerable, and that Free\r\nSociety requires total subversion and re-organization?\r\n\r\nShould you not, therefore, abolish your form of society, and adopt ours,\r\nuntil Mr. Greely, or Brigham Young, or Mr. Andrews, or Mr. Goodell, or\r\nsome other socialist of Europe or America, invents and puts into\r\nsuccessful practice, a social organization better than either, or until\r\nthe millenium does actually arrive?\r\n\r\nWith the assurance that I am quite as intent on abolishing Free Society,\r\nas you are on abolishing slavery, and with the confidence that all of\r\ndivine authority, and almost all of human authority, is on my side, I\r\nremain, your co-philanthropist, and\r\n\r\n                                       Obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                      GEO. FITZHUGH.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR. GARRISON.\r\n\r\n                                   _Port Royal, Va._, July 18, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--I am about to publish a work, entitled \"Cannibals All; or,\r\nSlaves Without Masters.\" I shall, in effect, say, in the course of my\r\nargument, that every theoretical abolitionist at the North is a\r\nSocialist or Communist, and proposes or approves radical changes in the\r\norganization of society. I shall cite Mr. Greely, Mr. Goodell, S. P.\r\nAndrews, Gerrit Smith, yourself, and other distinguished and leading\r\nabolitionists, of both sexes, as proof of my assertion. I shall also\r\nendeavor to show that all the literary mind of Western Europe concurs\r\nwith you. You, I perceive, have read a work already written by me, and\r\nwill not mistake my object. We live in a dangerous crisis, and every\r\npatriot and philanthropist should set aside all false delicacy in the\r\nearnest pursuit of truth. I believe Slavery natural, necessary,\r\nindispensable. You think it inexpedient, immoral and criminal. Neither\r\nof us should withhold any facts that will enable the public to form\r\ncorrect opinions. Should you not reply to this letter, I shall publish a\r\ncopy of it in my book, and insist that your silence is an admission of\r\nthe truth of my charges. I regret that your very able paper reaches me\r\nirregularly.\r\n\r\n                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                      GEO. FITZHUGH.\r\n\r\nLOYD GARRISON, Esq., Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTER TO MR. GREELY.\r\n\r\n                                   _Port Royal, Va._, July 20, 1856.\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--I am writing a work, entitled, \"Cannibals All; or, Slaves\r\nWithout Masters.\" I shall state, as a matter of fact, that all\r\ntheoretical abolitionists assert the failure of free society, and each\r\nproposes some plan for its re-organization. I shall cite particularly\r\nyourself, Gerrit Smith, S. P. Andrews, Mr. Goodell and Mr. Garrison. I\r\nshall rely on your discussion with the Courier and Enquirer, which has\r\nbeen burnt, chiefly as my proof of your opinion.\r\n\r\nI wish to afford you, and other distinguished gentlemen, an opportunity\r\nof correcting me if I have come to erroneous conclusions. I have,\r\ntherefore, written to Mr. Garrison, and I now write to you, to afford\r\nyou an opportunity to correct me if I am wrong. I know you all think our\r\nsociety a greater failure than your own; but you can _admit_ it for\r\nyourselves, not for us. I shall publish a copy of this letter in my\r\nbook, if you do not reply, (and possibly if you reply,) both this letter\r\nand your answer.\r\n\r\n'Tis not possible that our two forms of society can long co-exist. All\r\nChristendom is one republic, has one religion, belongs to one race, and\r\nis governed by one public opinion. Social systems, formed on opposite\r\nprinciples, cannot co-endure.\r\n\r\n  With much respect,\r\n\r\n                                  Your obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                                      GEO. FITZHUGH.\r\n\r\nBefore parting with our \"Masters in the Art of War,\" we must abate a\r\nlittle of the honors we have lavished on them. We have said that they\r\ndiscovered and proclaimed the failure of Free Society before we did. So\r\nthey did; but they mistook it for the failure of all society. Their\r\nlittle world of Western Europe and Yankeedom was, in their eyes, the\r\nwhole world. Hence, exclaims Mr. Carlyle, \"We must have a new world, if\r\nwe are to have any world at all.\" And Andrews takes up the cry, all the\r\nNorth joins in chorus, and sends the sad knell echoing back to Europe.\r\nNot so fast, gentlemen. Your world is not one-tenth of the whole world,\r\nand all is peace, quiet, and prosperity outside of it. We of the South,\r\nand all slave countries, want no new world.\r\n\r\nNow we were the first to discover and proclaim that Free Society _alone_\r\nhad failed; and failed because it was free. We occupied vantage ground,\r\na good stand-point, saw both forms of society, and thus discovered what\r\nour masters had overlooked. Every body sees it now, and gives us no more\r\ncredit for the discovery, than his cotemporaries gave Columbus--\"At mihi\r\nplaudo!\"\r\n\r\n  ITALIAM! primus conclamat Achates;\r\n  Italiam, coeto socii clamore salutant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDECAY OF ENGLISH LIBERTY, AND GROWTH OF ENGLISH POOR LAWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlackstone, whose Commentaries have been, for half a century, a common\r\nschool-book, and whose opinions on the rise, growth and full development\r\nof British liberty, are generally received as true, as well in America\r\nas in Europe, maintains a theory the very opposite of that for which we\r\nare about to contend.\r\n\r\nHe holds that the appearance of the House of Commons, about the reign of\r\nHenry the Third, was the dawn of approaching liberty. We contend that it\r\nwas the origin of the capitalist and moneyed interest government,\r\ndestined finally to swallow up all other powers in the State, and to\r\nbring about the most selfish, exacting and unfeeling class, despotism.\r\nHe thinks the emancipation of the serfs was another advance towards\r\nequality of rights and conditions. We think it aggravated inequality of\r\nconditions, and divested the liberated class of every valuable, social\r\nand political right. A short history of the English Poor Laws, which we\r\nshall annex, will enable the reader to decide between us on this head.\r\nHe thinks the Reformation increased the liberties of the subject. We\r\nthink that, in destroying the noblest charity fund in the world, the\r\nchurch lands, and abolishing a priesthood, the efficient and zealous\r\nfriends of the poor, the Reformation tended to diminish the liberty of\r\nthe mass of the people, and to impair their moral, social and physical\r\nwell-being. He thinks that the Revolution, by increasing the power of\r\nthe House of Commons, and lessening the prerogative of the Crown, and\r\nthe influence of the Church, promoted liberty. We think the Crown and\r\nthe Church the natural friends, allies and guardians of the laboring\r\nclass; the House of Commons, a moneyed firm, their natural enemies; and\r\nthat the Revolution was a marked epoch in the steady decay of British\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nHe thinks that the settlement of 1688 that successfully asserted in\r\ntheory the supreme sovereignty of Parliament, but particularly the\r\nsupreme sovereignty of the House of Commons, was the consummation or\r\nperfection of British liberty. We are sure, that that settlement, and\r\nthe chartering of the Bank of England, which soon succeeded it, united\r\nthe landed and moneyed interests, placed all the powers of government in\r\ntheir hands, and deprived the great laboring class of every valuable\r\nright and liberty. The nobility, the church, the king, were now\r\npowerless; and the mass of the people, wholly unrepresented in the\r\ngovernment, found themselves exposed to the grinding and pitiless\r\ndespotism of their natural and hereditary enemies. Mr. Charles Dickens,\r\nwho pities the condition of the negro slaves, thus sums up, in a late\r\nspeech, the worse condition of the \"Slaves without Masters,\" in Great\r\nBritain: \"Beneath all this, is a _heaving_ mass of poverty, ignorance\r\nand crime.\" Such is English liberty for the masses. Thirty thousand men\r\nown the lands of England, three thousand those of Scotland, and fewer\r\nstill those of Ireland. The great mass of the people are cut off from\r\nthe soil, have no certain means of subsistence, and are trespassers upon\r\nthe earth, without a single valuable or available right. Contrast their\r\nsituations with that of the old villeins, and see then whether our\r\ntheory of British liberty and the British constitution be true, or that\r\nof Blackstone.\r\n\r\nAll writers agree there were no beggars or paupers in England until the\r\nliberation of the serfs; and moreover admit that slaves, in all ages and\r\nin all countries, have had all their physical wants sufficiently\r\nsupplied. They also concur in stating, that crime was multiplied by\r\nturning loose on society a class of men who had been accustomed to and\r\nstill needed the control of masters.\r\n\r\nUntil the liberation of the villeins, every man in England had his\r\nappropriate situation and duties, and a mutual and adequate interest in\r\nthe soil. Practically the lands of England were the common property of\r\nthe people of England. The old Barons were not the representatives of\r\nparticular classes in Parliament, but the friends, and faithful and able\r\nrepresentatives of all classes; for the interests of all classes were\r\nidentified. Monteil, a recent French author, who has written the most\r\naccurate and graphic description of social conditions during the Feudal\r\nages, describes the serfs as the especial pets and favorites of the\r\nBarons. They were the most dependent, obedient, and useful members of\r\nthe feudal society, and like younger children, became favorites. The\r\nsame class now constitute the Proletariat, the Lazzaroni, the Gypsies,\r\nthe Parias, and the \"pauper banditti\" of Western Europe, and the Leperos\r\nof Mexico. As slaves, they were loved and protected; as pretended\r\nfreemen, they were execrated and persecuted.\r\n\r\nMr. Lester, a New York abolitionist, after a long and careful\r\nobservation and study of the present condition of the English laboring\r\nclass, solemnly avers, in his \"Glory and Shame of England,\" that he\r\nwould sooner subject his child to Southern slavery, than have him to be\r\na free laborer of England.\r\n\r\nBut it is the early history of the English Poor Laws, that proves most\r\nconclusively that the liberation of the villeins was a sham and a\r\npretence, and that their situation has been worse, their rights fewer,\r\nand their liberties less, since emancipation than before. The Poor Laws,\r\nfrom the time of Edward the Third to that of Elizabeth, were laws to\r\npunish the poor, and to keep them at work for low wages. Not till late\r\nin the reign of Elizabeth, was any charitable provision made for them.\r\nThen, most of them would have starved, as the confiscation and sales of\r\nthe church lands had deprived them of their only refuge, but for the new\r\nsystem of charity. The rich must have labor, and could not afford to let\r\nthem _all_ starve, although they were ready to attempt the most\r\nstringent means to prevent their increase.\r\n\r\nIn the Edinburgh Review, October, 1841, on Poor Law Reform, we find the\r\nfollowing admirable history and synopsis of the English Poor Laws:\r\n\r\n    The great experiment of Poor Law amendment, which has now for\r\n    seven years been in progress among our southern neighbors, appears\r\n    to us to have been insufficiently attended to, and therefore to\r\n    have been imperfectly understood in this part of the island. We do\r\n    not believe that many of our Scottish readers are fully aware of\r\n    the origin of the English Poor Laws, of the changes which they\r\n    underwent, of the abuses which they created, of the remedy which\r\n    has been applied; or of the obstacles which have diminished the\r\n    success of that great measure, and now threaten its efficiency.\r\n    And yet these are subjects of the deepest interest, even to those\r\n    who study legislation merely as a science. A series of laws are\r\n    exhibited, persevered in for centuries, by a nation always eminent\r\n    for practical wisdom, of which the result has almost invariably\r\n    been failure, or worse than failure; which in scarcely a single\r\n    instance have attained their objects, and in most cases have\r\n    produced effects precisely opposite to the intentions of their\r\n    framers;--have aggravated whatever they were intended to diminish,\r\n    and produced whatever they were intended to prevent. From us, as\r\n    Scotchmen, they merit peculiar attention, not only from the\r\n    resemblance of our poor laws to the earlier English statutes; but\r\n    from the probability that, as the connection between the two\r\n    countries becomes more intimate, we shall at no distant period\r\n    follow the example, whatever it may be, of the larger country to\r\n    which we are united; and participate in the evils and advantages\r\n    of the system which she may finally adopt. This fate already\r\n    threatens Ireland. It is scarcely probable that Scotland can avoid\r\n    it.\r\n\r\n    Each of the subjects to which we have alluded, would require a\r\n    volume for its complete development; but we are constrained to\r\n    give to them such consideration as is admissible within the limits\r\n    of an article of moderate length.\r\n\r\n    The Committee of the House of Commons which considered the Poor\r\n    Laws in 1817, commence their able Report by stating, that \"the\r\n    principle of a compulsory provision for the impotent, and for\r\n    setting to work the able-bodied, originated, without doubt, in\r\n    motives of the purest humanity.\" From this statement, plausible as\r\n    it is, we utterly dissent. We believe that the English poor laws\r\n    originated in selfishness, ignorance, and pride. Better motives,\r\n    without doubt, though misdirected by almost equal ignorance,\r\n    dictated the changes which were made in those laws during the 18th\r\n    century--the fourth which elapsed from their commencement; but we\r\n    are convinced that their origin was an attempt substantially to\r\n    restore the expiring system of slavery. The evils of slavery are\r\n    now understood; it is admitted that it destroys all the nobler\r\n    virtues, both moral and intellectual; that it leaves the slave\r\n    without energy, without truth, without honesty, without industry,\r\n    without providence; in short, without any of the qualities which\r\n    fit men to be respected or even esteemed. But mischievous as\r\n    slavery is, it has many plausible advantages, and freedom many\r\n    apparent dangers. The subsistence of a slave is safe; he cannot\r\n    suffer from insufficient wages, or from want of employment; he has\r\n    not to save for sickness or old age; he has not to provide for his\r\n    family; he cannot waste in drunkenness the wages by which they\r\n    were to be supported; his idleness or dishonesty cannot reduce\r\n    them to misery; they suffer neither from his faults nor his\r\n    follies. We believe that there are few of our Highland parishes in\r\n    which there is not more suffering from poverty than would be found\r\n    in an equal Russian population. Again, the master thinks that he\r\n    gains by being able to proportion the slave's subsistence to his\r\n    wants. In a state of freedom, average wages are always enough to\r\n    support, with more or less comfort, but still to support, an\r\n    average family. The unmarried slave receives merely his own\r\n    maintenance. A freeman makes a bargain; he asks whatever his\r\n    master can afford to pay. The competition among employers forces\r\n    them to submit to these terms; and the highly paid workman often\r\n    wastes his extra wages in idleness and debauchery. And when\r\n    employment is abundant; that is, when his services are most\r\n    wanted, he often tries to better himself by quitting his master.\r\n    All this is disagreeable to masters who have been accustomed to\r\n    the apparent economy of servile labor, and to its lethargic\r\n    obedience.\r\n\r\n    The great motive of the framers of the earlier English poor laws\r\n    was to remedy the latter class of inconveniences; those which\r\n    affect, or appear to affect the master. The motive of the framers\r\n    of the later acts again, beginning with George I., was to remedy\r\n    the first class of evils: those which affect the free laborer and\r\n    his family.\r\n\r\n    The first set of laws were barbarous and unskillful, and their\r\n    failure is evident from their constant re-enactment or amendment;\r\n    with different provisions and severer penalties. The second set\r\n    had a different fate--they ultimately succeeded, in many\r\n    districts, in giving to the laborer and to his family the security\r\n    of servitude. They succeeded in relieving him and those who, in a\r\n    state of real freedom, would have been dependent on him, from many\r\n    of the penalties imposed by nature on idleness, improvidence, and\r\n    misconduct. And by doing this, they in a great measure effected,\r\n    though certainly against the intentions of the legislature, the\r\n    object which had been vainly attempted by the earlier laws. They\r\n    confined the laborer to his parish; they dictated to him who\r\n    should be his master; and they proportioned his wages, not to his\r\n    services, but to his wants. Before the poor law amendment act,\r\n    nothing but the power of arbitrary punishment was wanting in the\r\n    pauperized parishes to a complete system of praedial slavery.\r\n\r\n    Our limits will not allow us to do more than to state very briefly\r\n    the material parts of the numerous statutes, beginning by the\r\n    statute of laborers, 23d Edward III., (1349,) and ending by the\r\n    39th Eliz. cap. 4, (1597,) which were passed for the supposed\r\n    benefit of masters.\r\n\r\n    The 23d Ed. III. requires all servants to accept the wages which\r\n    were usually given five or six years before, and to serve by the\r\n    year, not by the day; it fixes a positive rate of wages in many\r\n    employments; forbids persons to quit the places in which they had\r\n    dwelt in the winter, and search employment elsewhere in the\r\n    summer; or to remove, in order to evade the act, from one county\r\n    to another. A few years after, in 1360, the 34th Ed. III.\r\n    confirmed the previous statute, and added to the penalties, which\r\n    it imposed on laborers or artificers absenting themselves from\r\n    their services, that they should be branded on the forehead with\r\n    the letter F. It imposed also a fine of L10 on the mayor and\r\n    bailiffs of a town which did not deliver up a laborer or artificer\r\n    who had left his service.\r\n\r\n    Twenty-eight years after, in 1388, was passed the 12th Rich. II.,\r\n    which has generally been considered as the origin of the English\r\n    poor laws. By that act the acts of Ed. III. are\r\n    confirmed--laborers are prohibited, on pain of imprisonment, from\r\n    quitting their residences in search of work, unless provided with\r\n    testimonials stating the cause of their absence, and the time of\r\n    their returning, to be issued by justices of the peace at their\r\n    discretion. And, \"because laborers will not, nor, for a long\r\n    season, would not, serve without extrageous and excessive hire,\"\r\n    prices are fixed for their labor; and punishments awarded against\r\n    the laborer who receives more, and the master who gives more.\r\n    Persons who have been employed in husbandry until twelve years of\r\n    age, are prohibited from becoming artisans. Able-bodied beggars\r\n    are to be treated as laborers wandering without passports.\r\n    Impotent beggars are to remain where they are at the time of the\r\n    proclamation of the act; or, if those places are unwilling or\r\n    unable to support them, they are, within forty days, to repair to\r\n    the places where they were born, and there dwell during their\r\n    lives.\r\n\r\n    We have said that this act has been treated as the origin of the\r\n    English poor laws. It has been so considered in consequence of the\r\n    last clause, which is the first enactment recognizing the\r\n    existence of the impotent poor. But this enactment makes no\r\n    provision for them; though, by requiring them to be stationary in\r\n    a given spot for the rest of their lives, it seems to assume that\r\n    they would be supported there. It gives them, however, no claim,\r\n    nor is there a clause in the whole act intended to benefit any\r\n    persons except the employers of labor, and principally of\r\n    agricultural labor--that is to say, the land-owners who made the\r\n    law. If the provisions of the act could have been enforced, the\r\n    agricultural laborers, and they formed probably four-fifths of the\r\n    population of England, though nominally free, would have been as\r\n    effectually _ascripti glebae_ as any Polish serf. And, to make a\r\n    nearer approximation to slavery, in the next year (1389), the\r\n    13th Rich. II. was passed; which directs the justices of every\r\n    county to make proclamation every half year, at their discretion,\r\n    according to the price of food, what wages every artificer and\r\n    laborer shall receive by the day. This act, with some intervals,\r\n    during which the legislature attempted itself to fix the prices of\r\n    labor, remained substantially in force until the present century.\r\n    A further attempt to reduce husbandry laborers to a hereditary\r\n    caste of serfs, was made by the 7th Hen. IV. cap. 17. (1405,)\r\n    which, after reciting that the provisions of the former acts were\r\n    evaded by persons apprenticing their children to crafts in\r\n    towns--so that there is such a scarcity of husbandry laborers that\r\n    _gentlemen_ are impoverished--forbids persons not having 20s.\r\n    a-year in land to do so, under penalty of a year's imprisonment.\r\n\r\n    It appears, however, that the laborers did not readily submit to\r\n    the villenage to which the law strove to reduce them; for from\r\n    this time the English statute book is deformed by the enactments\r\n    against able-bodied persons leaving their homes, or refusing to\r\n    work at the wages offered to them, or loitering, (that is to say,\r\n    professing to be out of work,) which, to use the words of Dr.\r\n    Burn, \"make this part of English history look like the history of\r\n    the savages in America. Almost all the severities have been\r\n    inflicted, except scalping.\"[2] A new class of criminals,\r\n    designated by the terms \"sturdy rogues\" and \"vagabonds,\" was\r\n    created. Among these were included idle and suspect persons,\r\n    living suspiciously.[3] Persons having no land or craft whereby\r\n    they get their living.[4] Idle persons calling themselves\r\n    serving-men, having no masters. Persons who, after having been\r\n    sent home, absent themselves from such labor as they shall be\r\n    appointed to.[5] Able-bodied poor persons who do not apply\r\n    themselves to some honest labor or other; or serve even for meat\r\n    and drink, if nothing more is to be obtained.[6] Persons able to\r\n    labor, not having land or master, nor using any lawful employment.\r\n    Laborers using loitering, and refusing to work for reasonable\r\n    wages.[7]\r\n\r\n    The first attempt on the part of a person dependent on his labor\r\n    for his support to assert free agency, by changing his abode, or\r\n    by making a bargain for his services, or even by refusing to work\r\n    for \"bare meat and drink,\" rendered him liable to be whipped and\r\n    sent back to his place of birth, or last residence, for three\r\n    years; or, according to some statutes, for one year, there to be\r\n    at the disposal of the local authorities. The second attempt\r\n    subjected him, at one time, to slavery for life, \"to be fed on\r\n    bread and water and refuse meat, and caused to work by beating,\r\n    chaining, or otherwise;\" and for the third, he was to suffer death\r\n    as a felon.\r\n\r\n    We have seen that the 12th Rich. II. required the impotent poor to\r\n    remain for life where they were found at the proclamation of the\r\n    act, or at the places of their birth. The subsequent statutes\r\n    require them to proceed either to their places of birth, or last\r\n    places of residence, for three years. The law assumed, as we have\r\n    already remarked, that they would be supported there by voluntary\r\n    alms; and as respects the able-bodied, it assumed that an\r\n    able-bodied slave, for such the laborer given up to the local\r\n    authorities was, could always be made worth his maintenance; that\r\n    maintenance being, of course, the lowest that could keep him in\r\n    working order. It appears, however, that casual alms were found an\r\n    insufficient, or an inconvenient provision for the impotent; that\r\n    the local authorities were not sufficiently severe taskmasters of\r\n    the able-bodied; and that the keeping them at work required some\r\n    fund, by way of capital. The 27th Hen. VIII. cap. 25, (1536,)\r\n    therefore, requires the parishes to which the able-bodied should\r\n    be sent, \"to keep them to continual labor in such wise that they\r\n    may get their own living by the continual labor of their own\r\n    hands;\" on pain that every parish making default shall forfeit\r\n    twenty shillings a-month. It directs the churchwardens, and two\r\n    others of every parish, to collect alms and broken meat, to be\r\n    employed in supporting the impotent poor, and \"setting and keeping\r\n    to work the sturdy vagabonds;\" and forbids other almsgiving, on\r\n    pain of forfeiting ten times the amount. This is the first attempt\r\n    at making charity legal and systematic; and it was obviously a\r\n    part of the scheme for confining the laboring population to their\r\n    own parishes. It seems to have been supposed that voluntary alms,\r\n    systematically distributed, would provide wholly for the impotent,\r\n    and form a fund which, aided by the fruits of their forced labor,\r\n    would support the \"sturdy vagabonds;\" and, therefore, that no one\r\n    could have an excuse for changing his residence.\r\n\r\n    In the early part of Elizabeth's reign was passed a statute, 5th\r\n    Eliz. cap. 3, (1562,) inflicting the usual penalties, whipping,\r\n    slavery, and death, on sturdy vagabonds; that is to say, on those\r\n    who, having no property but their labor, presumed to act as if\r\n    they had a right to dispose of it; and containing the usual\r\n    provisions for confining the impotent poor to their parishes. In\r\n    one respect, however, it was a great step in advance; for it\r\n    contains for the first time a provision enabling the justices to\r\n    tax, at their discretion, those who refused to contribute to the\r\n    relief of the impotent and the keeping at work the able-bodied.\r\n    Concurrently with this statute, and indeed as a part of it, for it\r\n    is the next chapter on the roll of parliament, was passed the 5th\r\n    Eliz. cap. 4. This statute requires all persons brought up to\r\n    certain specified trades, at that time the principal trades of the\r\n    country, and not possessed of property, or employed in husbandry,\r\n    or in a gentleman's service, to continue to serve in such trades;\r\n    and orders that all other persons, between twelve years old and\r\n    sixty, not being gentlemen, or students in a school or university,\r\n    or entitled to property, and not engaged in maritime or mining\r\n    operations, be compelled to serve in husbandry with any person\r\n    that will require such person to serve, within the same county.\r\n    Females, in corporate towns, between the ages of twelve and forty,\r\n    and unmarried, are to be disposed of in service by the corporate\r\n    authorities, at such wages, and in such sort and manner, as the\r\n    authorities think meet. The hours of work are fixed by the\r\n    statute; and the justices are, twice a-year, after \"conferring\r\n    together respecting the plenty or scarcity of the time,\" to fix\r\n    the wages. Persons directly or indirectly paying more, are to be\r\n    punished by imprisonment and fine; persons receiving more, by\r\n    imprisonment. No person is to depart from one parish to another,\r\n    or from one hundred or county to serve in another hundred or\r\n    county, without a license from the local authorities.\r\n\r\n    When we recollect that disobedience to these enactments exposed a\r\n    man or a woman to be included in the proscribed class of\r\n    vagabonds, punishable by whipping, branding, slavery, and death,\r\n    it must be admitted that, whatever might be the practice, the\r\n    _law_ gave little freedom to the laboring classes.\r\n\r\n    The 14th Eliz. cap. 5, (1572,) carried on the same legislation\r\n    against the able-bodied, merely aggravating the penalty, by\r\n    subjecting the offenders (that is, all persons who would not work\r\n    for what the justices should think reasonable wages) to whipping\r\n    and burning for the first offence, and to the penalties of felony\r\n    for the second. It made a further approach to the present system,\r\n    by directing the fund \"for setting to work the rogues and\r\n    vagabonds,\" and relieving the impotent, to be raised by a general\r\n    assessment.\r\n\r\n    Twenty-five years afterwards, the two acts of the 39th Eliz. cap.\r\n    3 and 4, were passed, which for the first time divided into\r\n    separate statutes the punishment of the able-bodied, and the\r\n    relief of the impotent. By the second of these acts, vagabonds\r\n    (including, we repeat, persons able to labor, having no lord or\r\n    master, not using any lawful employments, and laborers refusing to\r\n    work for common wages) are to be whipped, but not branded, sent\r\n    back to their parishes: if they appear to be such as will not be\r\n    reformed, they are to be transported, or adjudged perpetually to\r\n    the galleys.\r\n\r\n    The other act, the 39th Eliz. cap. 3, differs so slightly from the\r\n    43d Eliz. cap. 2, that it requires no further attention.\r\n\r\n    The 43d of Eliz. directs, that the churchwardens and two or more\r\n    householders, to be appointed by the justices, shall take order,\r\n    with the consent of the justices, for setting to work children,\r\n    and all persons having no means to maintain themselves, and using\r\n    no ordinary or daily trade of life to get their living by; and to\r\n    raise a fund by taxation of the inhabitants for such setting to\r\n    work, and for the necessary relief of the lame, impotent, old, and\r\n    blind poor not able to work. And the justices are directed to send\r\n    to the House of Correction, or common jail, \"such as shall not\r\n    employ themselves to work, being appointed thereunto as\r\n    aforesaid.\"\r\n\r\n    It appears from this statement, that the 43d of Elizabeth deserves\r\n    neither the praise nor the blame which have been lavished on it.\r\n    So far from having been prompted by benevolence, it was a\r\n    necessary link in one of the heaviest chains in which a people\r\n    calling itself free has been bound. It was part of a scheme\r\n    prosecuted for centuries, in defiance of reason, justice, and\r\n    humanity, to reduce the laboring classes to serfs, to imprison\r\n    them in their parishes, and to dictate to them their employments\r\n    and their wages. Of course, persons confined to certain districts\r\n    by penalties of whipping, mutilation, and death, must be\r\n    supported; and, if they were capable of labor, it was obvious that\r\n    they ought to be made to contribute to the expense of their\r\n    maintenance. Thence arose the provisions for relieving the\r\n    impotent, and setting to work the able-bodied. But those\r\n    provisions do not, on the other hand, deserve the censure passed\r\n    on them by the Committee of the House of Commons in 1817. They\r\n    were not of a nature to induce the industrious to relax their\r\n    efforts. They held out no temptations to idleness. The\r\n    able-bodied, who were the objects of the 43d Elizabeth, were those\r\n    \"who, having no means to maintain themselves, used no ordinary and\r\n    daily trade of life to get their living by;\" such persons were, by\r\n    the previous acts, criminals; the work to which they were to be\r\n    put was forced work; and if they did not employ themselves in it,\r\n    \"being thereunto appointed as aforesaid,\" the justices were to\r\n    commit them to jail. The industrious laborer was not within the\r\n    spirit or the words of the act. This was, indeed, the complaint of\r\n    Lord Hale: \"The plaster,\" says his Lordship, \"is not so large as\r\n    the sore. There are many poor who are able to work if they had it,\r\n    and had it at reasonable wages, whereby they might support\r\n    themselves and their families. These are not within the provisions\r\n    of the law.\"[8]\r\n\r\n    And it was long before the legislature assented to any extension\r\n    of the 43d Elizabeth. The 8th and 9th Will. III. cap. 30, passed\r\n    nearly a century afterwards, \"To the intent that the money raised\r\n    _only_ for the relief of _such as are impotent as well as poor_,\r\n    may not be misapplied,\" requires all persons receiving relief, and\r\n    their families, to wear a badge, containing a large Roman P, and\r\n    the first letter of the name of the parish from which they\r\n    received relief; the object being not, as has been supposed, to\r\n    degrade the pauper, but to afford an easy means of detecting the\r\n    overseer who had relieved an able-bodied person.\r\n\r\n    The oppressive legislation of the Plantagenets and Tudors was\r\n    unsuccessful. The provisions on which its efficacy depended,\r\n    namely, the regulation of wages by the justices, the punishment of\r\n    those who refused to work for such wages, or who paid more than\r\n    such wages, and the punishment of those who left their parishes\r\n    without license, became gradually obsolete. Legally considered,\r\n    they remained in force until the present century. Sir Frederic\r\n    Eden has collected regulations of wages by the justices, from the\r\n    35th of Eliz. (1593) down to 1725. And the last which he gives,\r\n    that regulating wages for the county of Lancaster in 1725,\r\n    contains an exposition of the law by the justices, in the spirit\r\n    of the times of Henry VIII. or Elizabeth: \"That the transgressors\r\n    may be inexcusable when punished, we, the said justices, publish\r\n    these denunciations, penalties, punishments, and forfeitures which\r\n    the statutes impose. No servant that hath been in service before,\r\n    ought to be retained without a testimonial that he or she is\r\n    legally licensed to depart, and at liberty to serve elsewhere, to\r\n    be registered with the minister of the parish whence the servant\r\n    departs. The master retaining a servant without such testimonial\r\n    forfeits five pounds. The person wanting such testimonial shall be\r\n    imprisoned till he procure it. If he do not produce one within\r\n    twenty-one days, to be whipped as a vagabond. The person that\r\n    gives more wages than is appointed by the justices shall forfeit\r\n    five pounds, and be imprisoned ten days; the servant that takes\r\n    more to be imprisoned twenty-one days. Every promise or gift\r\n    whatever to the contrary shall be void. We, the said justices,\r\n    shall make strict enquiries, and see the defaults against these\r\n    ancient and useful statutes severely corrected and punished.\"\r\n\r\nFree society is a recent and small experiment. The English Poor Laws and\r\nthe English poor, constitute its only history; for only in England has\r\nthe experiment been made on a large scale for several centuries. If we\r\nhave not proved its total and disastrous failure in England, in our\r\nSociology, and in this chapter, we are resolved to prove it before we\r\nhave done.\r\n\r\nIt is a favorite political maxim of Englishmen, that taxation and\r\nrepresentation should go hand in hand; and that none shall be taxed\r\nwithout their own consent. Yet in Great Britain, the working men, who\r\npay every cent of tax, are not represented at all, have no vote in\r\nelections, and are taxed without and against their own consent; whilst\r\nthe capitalist class, who pay no taxes, but, as Gerrit Smith truly\r\nsays, are the mere conduits, that pass them from the laborers to the\r\ngovernment. This vampire capitalist class impose all the taxes, and pay\r\nnone. Alas! poor human nature! It is ever grasping at truth, and hugging\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE FRENCH LABORERS AND THE FRENCH REVOLUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nEach of the many French revolutions was occasioned by destitution almost\r\namounting to famine among the laboring classes. Each was the\r\ninsurrection of labor against capital. But until the revolution of 1848,\r\nthe revolutionists were unconscious alike of their motives and their\r\nobjects. They believed, till then, that political changes would remedy\r\nthe evils which oppressed them. After the revolution of 1830,\r\nphilosophers and statesmen, seeing the inadequacy of change of dynasty\r\nor of political policy, to alleviate the distresses of the great working\r\nclasses, began to search deeper for the causes of social embarrassment.\r\nSuddenly the discovery was made, not only in France, but throughout\r\nWestern Europe, that the disease was social, not political. That it was\r\nowing to the too unequal distribution of capital, and to its\r\nexploitation of labor. The ablest minds saw, as well in England as in\r\nFrance, that in transferring the reins of government from the hands of\r\nhereditary royalty and nobility, to those of the capitalist class, that\r\nthe people had exchanged a few masters for thousands of extortioners.\r\nNever did so vast a moral, intellectual and social movement arise so\r\nsuddenly, and spread so rapidly. The thing became the rage and fashion.\r\nEven in America, our Northern folks affected a disease, which they did\r\nnot feel, just as Alexander's courtiers aped his wry neck; and\r\nanti-rentism and land monopoly became the constant theme of\r\nconversation, lectures, speeches, books and essays. In France and in\r\nEngland, prior to 1830, there had been a few Socialists, such as Fourier\r\nand St. Simon, Owen and Fanny Wright--but they were little heeded, and\r\ngenerally considered about half crazy. Immediately thereafter, by far\r\nthe greater portion of the literary mind of Europe imbibed, in whole or\r\nin part, the doctrines of these early Socialists. The infection soon\r\nreached the lower classes, and occasioned revolution, intended to be\r\nsocial as well as political, throughout Western Europe. The Provisional\r\nGovernment in France, which immediately succeeded to the expulsion of\r\nLouis Philippe, was composed entirely of Socialists, and its programme\r\nand attempted measures were thoroughly socialistic.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the condition of the laboring classes in Europe, and\r\nespecially in France, was handled with an accuracy of detail and a\r\nbreadth of scientific expression in a review of our own work in the\r\nLiterary Messenger of March, 1855, of which we are incapable. The\r\nauthor, Professor H. of Virginia, is our corresponding acquaintance\r\nonly. Informed by letter that he would review us, and that he concurred\r\nin the general truth of our theory, we suggested to him in reply, that\r\nhe should, from his vast stores of learning, strengthen our main\r\npositions. He thought the suggestion a good one, and fulfilled our\r\nrequest, with an ability and learning, that no other man, on so short a\r\nnotice, could have done. As we have prompted, if not caused his toil, we\r\nmake no apology for appropriating so much of his review as seems to be a\r\nreply to our suggestion:\r\n\r\n    From the principles as laid down in theory and exemplified in\r\n    practice, we proceed to the effects. That religion has been\r\n    undermined, morals contaminated, crime increased, misery extended,\r\n    deepened and multiplied, want and starvation augmented, society\r\n    agitated, and orderly government endangered by the progress of the\r\n    so-called prosperity of the free labor system, is evident, without\r\n    further proof, to any one who reads contemporary literature, who\r\n    pays attention to the statements of newspapers, and of Poor Law\r\n    Reports, who notes the cases brought before the police or criminal\r\n    courts, or is cognizant from any source of information, of the\r\n    actual condition of the multitude and of the poor in England,\r\n    Scotland, Ireland, France, Germany, Prussia, and parts of\r\n    Switzerland, and in New England and the Northern States. The\r\n    connection of the results with the causes, is ably traced by Mr.\r\n    Fitzhugh, but not with sufficient care, minuteness and precision;\r\n    and the actual character and enormity of the results is exhibited\r\n    by him, and by an indefinite array of the most various and\r\n    unexceptionable testimony. The History of the Working Classes, by\r\n    Robert du Var, which we have joined with the Sociology for the\r\n    South, as the text for the present observations, is full of\r\n    evidence to this effect with regard to France; and for the other\r\n    countries specified, ample testimony may be easily obtained. The\r\n    Boston papers will suffice to illustrate the wretchedness of the\r\n    laboring classes in New England: the New York Herald and Tribune,\r\n    the works of Stephen Pearl Andrews, and of Greeley himself, will\r\n    render the same service for the other Northern States: Alton\r\n    Locke, Mary Barton, Mayhew's London Labor and the London Poor, the\r\n    debates in Parliament, the Reports of the Poor Law Commissioners,\r\n    and the English Reviews, will amply illustrate the condition of\r\n    Great Britain and Ireland; and for Germany, reference may be made\r\n    to Hacklander's Europarsches Sclavenleben, a work which has\r\n    followed the example of Uncle Tom's Cabin, and portrayed the\r\n    condition of the inferior classes in Europe, as a much more\r\n    legitimate object of European sympathy and consideration than\r\n    American Slavery. Where the evidence is so abundant and\r\n    voluminous, selection would be as unnecessary as it would be\r\n    tedious. It is within the reach of every one who desires to\r\n    consult it; and we need not load our pages with extracts to prove\r\n    what has been frequently and sufficiently proved before, and what\r\n    is so notoriously true as to be undeniable. A few quotations to\r\n    illustrate the condition of free labor societies we may indeed\r\n    quote at a later period, in connection with a different division\r\n    of the argument; but they are wholly unnecessary to confirm the\r\n    allegation of the wretchedness and depravity which are consuming\r\n    the vitals of the principal free societies of the Nineteenth\r\n    Century. They are rendered still more unnecessary by the fact that\r\n    the acceptability of Socialism in all of those communities,\r\n    betrays the extent of both the misery and the social disease to be\r\n    cured; and the confession of the multitude of recent writers on\r\n    social topics, admits not merely the evils which we have\r\n    specified, and their dependence on the theory and practice of free\r\n    societies, but acknowledges also the truth of the general\r\n    conclusion, that the free societies enumerated have unquestionably\r\n    failed, they have not produced the permanent or general blessings\r\n    anticipated from them, they have produced overwhelming social\r\n    disaster, multiplied indefinitely the woes and the vices of the\r\n    poor, threatened all society and government and national existence\r\n    in those communities, and announced a future so dark that little\r\n    more than its gloom and spectral shapes can be distinctly\r\n    recognized.\r\n\r\n    We regard Mr. Fitzhugh's employment of these admissions by\r\n    European writers and Northern reformers, as constituting the most\r\n    important position of his argument, and the most characteristic\r\n    novelty in his defence of the South. The testimonies which he\r\n    adduces are very strong and pointed, but they may be easily\r\n    multiplied, and will gain an accession of strength from such\r\n    multiplications. For years we have carefully collected similar\r\n    acknowledgments from foreign writers, and cheerfully contribute\r\n    them to the cause of the South, and the fortification of Mr.\r\n    Fitzhugh's position. And let it be remembered, that neither in the\r\n    Sociology for the South, nor in the quotations which will be\r\n    shortly introduced here, is the sole or principal obligation due\r\n    to Chartists, Socialists, Communists, or Agrarians of any sort.\r\n    From such authors some admissions have been received, but the\r\n    chief contributions are derived from those who have been the most\r\n    strenuous supporters of past social arrangements, and who,\r\n    notwithstanding a great diversity of views, abilities, studies,\r\n    and opportunities of knowledge, still represent the sober\r\n    conservative sense of their respective communities. We regret that\r\n    Mr. Fitzhugh should have extended so much countenance to the\r\n    Socialists, and should have partially identified Socialism and\r\n    Slavery, but the strongest part of his testimonies to the failure\r\n    of free societies, is derived from other declarations than theirs,\r\n    and we shall imitate his example.\r\n\r\n    We begin, however, with a Socialist, but almost the only one whom\r\n    we shall summon to the stand:\r\n\r\n    \"The French Revolution was an abortion. The trading classes (_la\r\n    bourgeoisie_) organized themselves in the name of capital, and,\r\n    instead of becoming a man, the serf became a proletaire. What then\r\n    was his situation? The most painful of all, the most intolerable\r\n    which can be conceived. Like all the proletaires, the trading\r\n    classes had shouted: 'Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.' The result\r\n    has been that every thing which was proletaire--that is to say,\r\n    all those who have no capital, groan under the most cruel usage\r\n    (_exploitation_.) They cannot be freemen, nor brothers, nor\r\n    equals. Not free, because their daily bread depends on a thousand\r\n    accidents produced and engendered by the competition of\r\n    capitalists among themselves; not brothers, because, with hearts\r\n    crushed and lacerated by the evils which overwhelm them, they\r\n    cannot love those whose creed is so fatal to them; not equals,\r\n    because capital being the supreme law, it is only through it that\r\n    any participation or concurrence in social power is possible.\"[9]\r\n\r\n    An apology is due for not attempting to translate the term\r\n    proletaires in the above passage, but every one familiar with the\r\n    condition of modern free societies, is aware that it is absolutely\r\n    untranslateable. It is an indispensable word in modern times, and\r\n    the impossibility of avoiding its use is a stronger proof of the\r\n    failure of free societies, than the invention of the phrase\r\n    Sociology, which Mr. Fitzhugh regards in this light. It ought to\r\n    be unhesitatingly introduced into the English language; it can\r\n    boast of a very respectable Latin descent; it occurs in the XII\r\n    Tables, and originally signified a person of the lowest class, too\r\n    poor to pay taxes, and unable to serve the State otherwise than by\r\n    raising children and thus increasing the population[10]--a very\r\n    doubtful service in modern Europe.\r\n\r\n    We return to Mr. Robert du Var:\r\n\r\n    \"It must be remarked, that what is called pauperism, this sore,\r\n    this ulcer, which infests, and more and more consumes the body\r\n    social, could not exist in the same degree amongst the nations of\r\n    antiquity. It is a phenomenon which could only arise as the\r\n    consequence of the transformation of slavery into serfdom, and of\r\n    serfdom into free labor (_proletariat_.) * * * In antiquity, every\r\n    one, whether free or not, citizen or slave, was always connected\r\n    with some centre which ensured at least his material support.\"[11]\r\n\r\n    \"As a result of the individual liberty, independent of any central\r\n    power, proclaimed by Christianity, favored and developed by the\r\n    instincts of the Northern barbarians, legitimated and transformed\r\n    into a social doctrine by the institution of Communes, was formed\r\n    and agglomerated throughout Europe an innumerable population,\r\n    having no material connection with the regular society, and having\r\n    for itself nothing but the most naked liberty, that is to say,\r\n    misery, poverty, isolation. Thence issued the poor, the beggars,\r\n    the thieves--in one word, parias of every description, with whom\r\n    society was compelled to compound, willingly or reluctantly, by\r\n    the foundation of establishments intended to palliate the bleeding\r\n    wound of the pauperism which had been engendered by liberty.\"[12]\r\n\r\n    \"From whatever point the modern system is regarded, it seems\r\n    impossible not to recognize that the Politico-economical rule of\r\n    free competition is the negation, as its name indicates, of all\r\n    ties and communion of interests between the members of society.\r\n    Free competition is a free field open to every individual,\r\n    provided or not with the elements necessary and indispensable to\r\n    its manifestations; free competition, in a word, is liberty, but\r\n    liberty without other rule than the material and moral force, of\r\n    which each one may be able to dispose in the presence of the\r\n    thousand causes which produce a difference in the position of\r\n    individuals.\"[13]\r\n\r\n    \"But, we say that a system which thus arms, morally, the poor\r\n    against each other, is a barbarous system, and contrary to\r\n    civilization: it is barbarous, inasmuch as it developes all the\r\n    bad tendencies of the human heart: it is contrary to civilization,\r\n    because, instead of facilitating harmonious relations among men,\r\n    it inclines them to mutual repulsion and hostility.\"[14]\r\n\r\n    This is a sufficient sample of M. Robert du Var's testimony. The\r\n    greater part of his work is to the same effect: and there is a\r\n    singular accordance between his censures of Political Economy,[15]\r\n    and those uttered by Mr. Fitzhugh. They merit especial attention.\r\n\r\n    We will cite another Socialist, M. Vidal:\r\n\r\n    \"The ox, the horse, the hog eat according to their hunger: their\r\n    desires are even anticipated: they have their subsistence assured.\r\n    It is the same thing in the case of the slave. For the ox, the\r\n    horse, the hog, the slave, belong to a master, and their loss is\r\n    the loss of the owner: _res perit domino_, says the Digest. But\r\n    with the hired laborer it is different! He belongs to himself.\r\n\r\n    His death is the loss of his family whom he maintained, and who\r\n    will no longer find the means of living. What matter to an\r\n    employer is the death of a hired laborer? Are there not every\r\n    where millions of arms always ready to offer themselves at reduced\r\n    wages?\"[16]\r\n\r\n    Let us turn to evidence of a different character. Here is Sir\r\n    Robert Peel's testimony to the condition of Ireland before 1844,\r\n    previous to the potato-rot and the famine:\r\n\r\n    \"It may be assured that the fourth class of houses, (according to\r\n    the census,) are generally unfit for human habitation; and yet it\r\n    would appear that in the best circumstanced county, in this\r\n    respect, the county of Down, 24.7 per cent., or one-fourth of the\r\n    population, live in houses of this class: while in Kerry, the\r\n    population is 66.7 per cent., or about two-thirds of the whole;\r\n    and, taking the average of the whole population of Ireland, as\r\n    given by the census commissioner, we find that in the rural\r\n    districts about 43 per cent. of the families, and in the civic\r\n    districts, about 36 per cent. inhabit houses of the fourth\r\n    class. * * *\r\n\r\n    \"The lowest, or fourth class, remember, comprises all mud cabins,\r\n    having but one room.\"[17]\r\n\r\n    Mr. Kay, from whom the foregoing remarks of Sir Robert Peel are\r\n    quoted, thus comments upon a murder committed in open day in\r\n    Ireland. The two murderers had escaped:\r\n\r\n    \"Why,\" he asks, \"were not these men apprehended? Because of the\r\n    rottenness that there is in the state of society in these\r\n    districts; because of the sympathy which there is on the part of\r\n    the great bulk of the population with those who, by these dreadful\r\n    acts of vengeance, are supposed to be the conservators of the\r\n    rights of the tenant, and supposed to give him that protection\r\n    which imperial legislation has denied. The first thing that ever\r\n    called my attention to the condition of Ireland, was the reading\r\n    an account of one of these outrages. I thought of it for a moment,\r\n    but the truth struck me at once: and all I have seen since\r\n    confirms it. When law refuses its duty--when government denies the\r\n    right of a people--when competition is so fierce for the little\r\n    land, which the monopolists grant to cultivation in Ireland--when,\r\n    in fact, for a bare potato, millions are scrambling, these people\r\n    are driven back from law and from the usages of civilization to\r\n    that which is termed the law of nature, and, if not of the\r\n    strongest, the law of the vindictive; and in this case the people\r\n    of Ireland believe, to my certain knowledge, that it is only by\r\n    these acts of vengeance, periodically committed, that they can\r\n    hold in suspense the arm of the proprietor and the agent, who, in\r\n    too many cases, if he dared, would exterminate them.\"[18]\r\n\r\n    A pretty result, this, for free labor and free competition, and\r\n    abolitionism, to have arrived at. But Ireland was always esteemed\r\n    _un mauvais sujet_. Let us cross St. George's Channel:\r\n\r\n    \"The English peasant is thus deprived of almost every motive to\r\n    practice economy, and self-denial, beyond what suffices to provide\r\n    his family with food and clothing. Once a peasant in England, and\r\n    a man cannot hope that he himself, or his children, will ever be\r\n    anything better, than a mere laborer for weekly hire.\r\n\r\n    \"This unhappy feature of an English peasant's life was most\r\n    powerfully, and only too justly depicted in those articles of 'The\r\n    Times,' to which I have referred above. It was there shown that\r\n    during the last half century, every thing has been done to deprive\r\n    the peasant of any interest in the preservation of public order;\r\n    of any wish to maintain the existing constitution of society; of\r\n    all hope of raising himself in the world, or of improving his\r\n    condition of life; of all attachment to his country; of all\r\n    feelings of there really existing any community of interest\r\n    between himself and the higher ranks of society; and of all\r\n    consciousness that he has anything to lose by political changes;\r\n    and that every thing has been done to render him dissatisfied with\r\n    his condition, envious of the richer classes, and discontented\r\n    with the existing order of things.\"[19]\r\n\r\n    This, too, is a pretty picture, which is not relieved by the\r\n    further information that,\r\n\r\n    \"In the year 1770, there were, it is said, in England alone,\r\n    250,000 freehold estates in the hands of 250,000 different\r\n    families. In the year 1815, at the close of the revolutionary war,\r\n    the whole of the lands of England were concentrated in the hands\r\n    of only 32,000 proprietors.\"[20]\r\n\r\n    \"What is the result? The labor market in the manufacturing towns\r\n    is constantly overstocked; the laborers and shopkeepers find new\r\n    and eager competitors constantly added to the list; competition in\r\n    the towns is rendered unnaturally intense; profits and wages are\r\n    both unnaturally reduced; the town work-houses and the town gaols\r\n    are crowded with inmates; the inhabitants are overburthened with\r\n    rates; and the towns swarm with paupers and misery.\r\n\r\n    \"I know not what others may think, but to me it is a sad and\r\n    grievous spectacle, to see the enormous amount of vice and\r\n    degraded misery which our towns exhibit, and then to think, that\r\n    we are doing all we can to foster and stimulate the growth and\r\n    extension of this state of things, by that system of laws, which\r\n    drives so many of the peasants of both England and Ireland to the\r\n    towns, and increases the already vast mass of misery by so doing.\r\n\r\n    \"I speak with deliberation, when I say, that I know of no\r\n    spectacle so degraded, and if I may be allowed to use a strong\r\n    word, so horrible, as the back streets and suburbs of English and\r\n    Irish towns, with their filthy inhabitants; with their crowds of\r\n    half-clad, filthy, and degraded children, playing in the dirty\r\n    kennels; with their numerous gin-palaces, filled with people,\r\n    whose hands and faces show how their flesh is, so to speak,\r\n    impregnated with spirituous liquors--the only solaces, poor\r\n    creatures, that they have!--and with poor young girls, whom a want\r\n    of religious training in their infancy, and misery, has driven to\r\n    the most degraded and pitiful of all pursuits.\"[21]\r\n\r\n    \"Of 1600, [pauper children in London,] who were examined, 162\r\n    confessed that they had been in prison, not merely once, nor even\r\n    twice, but some of them several times; 116 had run away from their\r\n    homes; 170 slept in the \"lodging-houses;\" 253 had lived altogether\r\n    by beggary; 216 had neither shoes nor stockings; 280 had no hat or\r\n    cap, or covering for the head; 101 had no linen; 349 had never\r\n    slept in a bed; many had no recollection of ever having been in a\r\n    bed; 68 were the children of convicts.\"[22]\r\n\r\n    \"The further we examine, the more painful, disgusting and\r\n    incredible does the tale become.\r\n\r\n    \"We see on every hand stately palaces, to which no country in the\r\n    world offers any parallel. The houses of our rich are more\r\n    gorgeous and more luxurious than those of any other land. Every\r\n    clime is ransacked to adorn or furnish them. The soft carpets, the\r\n    heavy rich curtains, the luxuriously easy couches, the beds of\r\n    down, the services of plate, the numerous servants, the splendid\r\n    equipages, and all the expensive objects of literature, science,\r\n    and the arts, which crowd the palaces of England, form but items\r\n    in an _ensemble_ of refinement and\r\n\r\n    magnificence, which was never imagined or approached, in all the\r\n    splendor of the ancient empires.\r\n\r\n    \"But look beneath all this display and luxury, and what do we see\r\n    there? A pauperized and suffering people.\r\n\r\n    \"To maintain a show, we have degraded the masses, until we have\r\n    created an evil so vast, that we now despair of ever finding a\r\n    remedy.\"[23]\r\n\r\n    We may now dismiss Mr. Kay--this testimony is sufficiently direct\r\n    and sufficiently ample: and yet it would have been easy to have\r\n    introduced many more and stronger statements made by him, which\r\n    have been omitted because they were loo long to be quoted. Mr. Kay\r\n    is neither Chartist nor Socialist. He is a graduate of Trinity\r\n    College, Cambridge, a Barrister-at-law, and has traveled over\r\n    Europe for eight years, under an appointment from the Senate of\r\n    the University of Cambridge, as Traveling Bachelor of the\r\n    University, commissioned \"to travel through Western Europe in\r\n    order to examine the social condition of the poorer classes of the\r\n    different countries.\"[24] The evidence of such a man should be\r\n    authoritative, but we will continue our quotations:\r\n\r\n    \"It is undeniable that morality has declined in our days with the\r\n    progress of knowledge.\"[25]\r\n\r\n    \"One word more, and we have done. On many questions of practical\r\n    duty, men are now affecting to be wiser\r\n\r\n    and better than the Bible. Plans of social progress and\r\n    improvement are rife, that have an air of transcendental\r\n    refinement about them, unknown to the homely morality of the Word\r\n    of God. We are becoming too sentimental to endure that even the\r\n    murderer shall be put to death. And now we are for bettering God's\r\n    ordinance of marriage itself; and we see a fine, romantic, tender\r\n    charm in an alliance of brothers and sisters, on which God has\r\n    stamped his curse. What may such things betoken? Are they ominous\r\n    of such unbridled lawlessness and lust as marked the days before\r\n    the Flood? Are they signs of the days not unlike these that are to\r\n    precede the coming of the Son of Man?\"[26]\r\n\r\n    \"The task of restoring health and soundness to a society so\r\n    fearfully diseased as ours unquestionably is, is on all hands\r\n    acknowledged to be at once the noblest and the most imperative to\r\n    which citizens or statesmen can now direct their energies.\"[27]\r\n\r\n    \"Society, such as it now is in England, will not continue to\r\n    endure, &c.\"[28]\r\n\r\n    \"The last battle of civilization is the severest: the last problem\r\n    the knottiest to solve. Out of all the multitudinous ingredients\r\n    and influences of the past; out of the conquest of nature, and the\r\n    victory of freedom; out of the blending and intermixture of all\r\n    previous forms\r\n\r\n    of polity and modifications of humanity, has arisen a complex\r\n    order of society, of which the disorders and anomalies are as\r\n    complex as its own structure. We are now summoned to the combat,\r\n    not with material difficulties, nor yet with oppressors nor with\r\n    priests, but with an imperfect and diseased condition of that\r\n    social world of which we form a part; with pains and evils\r\n    appalling in their magnitude, baffling in their subtlety,\r\n    perplexing in their complication, and demanding far more clear\r\n    insight and unerring judgment, than even purity of purpose, or\r\n    commanding energy of will. This conflict may be said to date from\r\n    the first French Revolution; and it has been increasing in\r\n    intensity ever since, till it has reached to a vividness and\r\n    solemnity of interest, which surpasses and overshadows the\r\n    attractions of all other topics, &c. &c.\"[29]\r\n\r\n    \"England's rapidly accelerating decline is a very remarkable and\r\n    mournful phenomenon; it is a mortal sickness for which there is no\r\n    remedy. I liken the English of the present day to the Romans of\r\n    the third century after Christ.\"[30]\r\n\r\n    The analogy might be extended to nearly all of modern\r\n    civilization.\r\n\r\n    \"Tremendous catastrophes have come to pass, and there is no\r\n    resistance; not a semblance of great men, no joy or enthusiasm, no\r\n    hopes for the future, except that the time will one day come, when\r\n    by means of mutual instruction every peasant boy shall be able to\r\n    read. The\r\n\r\n    truth of the thing is the unveiled destitution of the populace,\r\n    who are resolved to bear it no longer, and this again paves the\r\n    way for a revision of property; which is not, indeed, something\r\n    new under the sun, but has been unheard of for centuries past, and\r\n    even now seems quite inconceivable to our politicians, who have\r\n    set property, in the place of God, in the Holiest of Holies, &c,\r\n    &c.\"[31]\r\n\r\n    We cannot venture to extend our extracts, though we have the\r\n    materials before us to increase them ten--nay, twenty-fold. We\r\n    contribute these merely as a confirmation of Mr. Fitzhugh's\r\n    position, that, really and confessedly, Free Society has proved a\r\n    calamitous and irremediable failure in the principal communities\r\n    of Christendom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE REFORMATION--THE RIGHT OF PRIVATE JUDGMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reformation, like the American Revolution, was originated and\r\nconducted to successful issue by wise, good and practical men, whose\r\nintuitive judgments and sagacious instincts enabled them to feel their\r\nway through the difficulties that environed them. Wise men know that\r\nthere is too much of complexity in the tangled web of human affairs, to\r\njustify the attempt at once to practice and philosophise, to act and to\r\nreason. Fools and philosophers too often mar the good works of such men,\r\nby pretending to see clearly, and to define accurately, the principles\r\nof action which have led to those works. A Washington, a Peel, or a\r\nWellington, never \"writes himself down an ass\" by appealing to abstract\r\nprinciples to justify measures which are rendered necessary by a\r\nthousand minute and peculiar circumstances of the hour, which common\r\nsense and experience instinctively appreciate, but which philosophy in\r\nvain attempts to detect or to generalize. Common sense never attempts\r\n\"to expel nature,\" but suggests and carries through a thousand useful\r\nreforms by recurrence to and comparison with the past, and by cautious\r\nexperimentation.\r\n\r\nCommon sense sometimes errs by excess of conservation; but it is better\r\nto err with Pope, who thought \"Whatever is, is right,\" than with\r\nJefferson, whose every act and word proves that he held that \"Whatever\r\nis, is _wrong_.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was not the thought and the act of Luther, Calvin,\r\nCranmer and Erasmus; but the thought and the act of society--the vox\r\nPopuli, vox Dei. Popes and cardinals are not infallible, but society is.\r\nIts harmony is its health; and to differ with it is heresy or treason,\r\nbecause social discord inflicts individual misery; and what disturbs and\r\ndisarranges society, impairs the happiness and well-being of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine of the infallibility of society, is suggested, though not\r\nexpressed, in the maxim--Salus populi, est suprema lex. The Puritans, in\r\nthe early days of New England, acted it out; and if they hung a few\r\ntroublesome old women, the good that they achieved was more than\r\ncompensated for by any errors they may have committed. Liberty of the\r\npress, liberty of speech, freedom of religion, or rather freedom from\r\nreligion, and the unlimited right of private judgment, have borne no\r\ngood fruits, and many bad ones. Infidels, Skeptics, Millerites, Mormons,\r\nAgrarians, Spiritual Rappers, Wakemanites, Free Negroes and Bloomers,\r\ndisturb the peace of society, threaten the security of property, offend\r\nthe public sense of decency, assail religion, and invoke anarchy.\r\nSociety has the right, and is in duty bound, to take care of itself; and\r\nwhen public opinion becomes powerless, law should intervene, and punish\r\nall acts, words, or opinions, which have become criminal by becoming\r\ndangerous or injurious.\r\n\r\nWe would rejoice to see intolerance of error revived in New England.\r\nLaxity of rule and laxity of public opinion is sin of itself, and leads\r\nto thousands of sins. New England is culpable for permitting Parker and\r\nBeecher to stir up civil discord and domestic broils from the pulpit.\r\nThese men deserve punishment, for they have instigated and occasioned a\r\nthousand murders in Kansas; yet they did nothing more than carry into\r\npractice the right of private judgment, liberty of speech, freedom of\r\nthe press and of religion. These boasted privileges have become far more\r\ndangerous to the lives, the property and the peace of the people of this\r\nUnion, than all the robbers and murderers and malefactors put together.\r\n\r\nThe Reformation was but an effort of Nature--the vis medicatrix\r\nnaturae--throwing off what was false, vicious, or superfluous, and\r\nretaining what was good.\r\n\r\nThe great men of the day but show larger portions of the common\r\nthought. Men, and all other social and gregarious animals, have a\r\ncommunity of thought, of motions, instincts and intuitions. The social\r\nbody is of itself a thinking, acting, sentient being. This is eminently\r\nobservable with the lower animals. Bees and herds perform their\r\nevolutions with too much rapidity and precision, to leave any doubt but\r\nthat one mind and one feeling, either from within or without, directs\r\ntheir movements. The great error of modern philosophy is the ignorance\r\nor forgetfulness of this fact. The first departure from it was not the\r\nReformation--for that was preeminently a social idea and a social\r\nmovement;--but the doctrine of the right of private judgment, which\r\nspeculative philosophers and vain schismatics attempted to engraft upon\r\nit, or deduce from it. Human equality, the social contract, the\r\nlet-alone and selfish doctrines of political economy, universal liberty,\r\nfreedom of speech, of the press, and of religion, spring directly from\r\nthis doctrine, or are only new modes of expressing it. Agrarianism, Free\r\nLove, and No Government, are its logical sequences: for the right to\r\njudge for ourself implies the right to act upon our judgments, and that\r\ncan never be done in a world where the private appropriation of all\r\ncapital, and the interference of government, restricts our free agency,\r\nand paralyzes our action on all sides.\r\n\r\nWe sometimes think the burning of the Alexandrian Library was a\r\nprovidential purification, just as the fictitious burning, by Cervantes,\r\nof Don Quixote's library ridded the world of the useless rubbish of the\r\nMiddle Ages, by the ridicule so successfully attached to it. Sure we\r\nare, that a fire that would consume all the theological and other\r\nphilosophical speculations of the last two centuries, would be a happy\r\nGod-send.\r\n\r\nOur Revolution, so wise in its conception and so glorious in its\r\nexecution, was the mere assertion by adults of the rights of adults, and\r\nhad nothing more to do with philosophy than the weaning of a calf. It\r\nwas the act of a people seeking national independence, not the Utopian\r\nscheme of speculative philosophers, seeking to establish human equality\r\nand social perfection.\r\n\r\nBut the philosophers seized upon it, as they had upon the Reformation,\r\nand made it the unwilling and unnatural parent of the largest and most\r\nhideous brood of ills that had ever appeared at one birth, since the\r\nopening of the box of Pandora. Bills of Rights, Acts of Religious\r\nFreedom and Constitutions, besprinkled with doctrines directly at war\r\nwith all stable government, seem to be the basis on which our\r\ninstitutions rest. But only seem to be; for, in truth, our laws and\r\ngovernment are either old Anglo-Saxon prescriptive arrangements, or else\r\nthe gradual accretions of time, circumstance and necessity. Throw our\r\npaper platforms, preambles and resolutions, guaranties and\r\nconstitutions, into the fire, and we should be none the worse off,\r\nprovided we retained our institutions--and the necessities that begat,\r\nand have, so far, continued them.\r\n\r\nAll government proceeds ab extra. Neither individuals nor societies can\r\ngovern themselves, any more than the mouse can live in the exhausted\r\nreceiver, or the clown lift himself by the lappel of his pantaloons. The\r\nSouth is governed by the necessity of keeping its negroes in order,\r\nwhich preserves a healthy conservative public opinion. Had the negroes\r\nvotes, the necessity would be removed, because the interest of the\r\ngoverning class would cease to be conservative. The necessity, the\r\ngoverning power ab extra, would be removed. The little republics of\r\nancient Greece were able to preserve the most artificial social\r\narrangements, under the necessities which slavery and foreign hostile\r\npressure from without begat. They were afraid of change, because\r\ninsurrection was dangerous.\r\n\r\nIf government on paper were really useless and harmless, we should say\r\nnothing about it. But it is fraught with danger, first because we are\r\napt to rely on it for safety and security of rights, and secondly\r\nbecause it rarely suits the occasion. Men and societies are endowed by\r\nProvidence generally with sufficient knowledge and judgment to act\r\ncorrectly or prudently under circumstances as they arise; but they\r\ncannot foresee or provide for the future, nor lay down rules for other\r\npeople's conduct. All platforms, resolutions, bills of rights and\r\nconstitutions, are true in the particular, false in the general. Hence\r\nall legislation should be repealable, and those instruments are but\r\nlaws. Fundamental principles, or the higher law, are secrets of nature\r\nwhich God keeps to himself. The vain attempt of \"frequent recurrence to\r\nthem,\" is but the act of the child who builds card houses, for the\r\npleasure of knocking them down. Recurrence to fundamental principles and\r\nappeals to the higher law, are but the tocsin of revolution that may\r\nupset everything, but which will establish nothing, because no two men\r\nare agreed as to what the higher law, alias \"fundamental principles,\"\r\nis.\r\n\r\nMoses, and Lycurgus, and Solon, and Numa, built their institutions to\r\nlast, enjoined it on the people never to change them, and threw around\r\nthem the sanctity of religion, to ward off the sacrilegious hand of\r\nfuture innovation. \"A frequent recurrence to fundamental principles,\"\r\nand the kicking down of card houses, was not part of their science of\r\ngovernment. We have often thought, that of all the lost arts, the art of\r\ngovernment was the only one whose loss we would deplore, or whose\r\nrecovery is worth the pains of study and research.\r\n\r\nTo us it seems that \"first causes,\" \"fundamental principles,\" and the\r\n\"higher law,\" mean one and the same thing: An \"ignis fatuus,\" that it is\r\ndangerous to pursue, and hopeless to overtake.\r\n\r\nWe may be doing Mr. Jefferson injustice, in assuming that his\r\n\"fundamental principles\" and Mr. Seward's \"higher law,\" mean the same\r\nthing; but the injustice can be very little, as they both mean just\r\nnothing at all, unless it be a determination to inaugurate anarchy, and\r\nto do all sorts of mischief. We refer the reader to the chapter on the\r\n\"Declaration of Independence,\" &c., in our Sociology, for a further\r\ndissertation on the fundamental powder-cask abstractions, on which our\r\nglorious institutions _affect_ to repose. We say _affect_, because we\r\nare sure neither their repose nor their permanence would be disturbed by\r\nthe removal of the counterfeit foundation.\r\n\r\nThe true greatness of Mr. Jefferson was his fitness for revolution. He\r\nwas the genius of innovation, the architect of ruin, the inaugurator of\r\nanarchy. His mission was to pull down, not to build up. He thought\r\neverything false as well in the physical, as in the moral world. He fed\r\nhis horses on potatoes, and defended harbors with gun-boats, because it\r\nwas contrary to human experience and human opinion. He proposed to\r\ngovern boys without the authority of masters or the control of\r\nreligion, supplying their places with Laissez-faire philosophy, and\r\nmorality from the pages of Lawrence Sterne. His character, like his\r\nphilosophy, is exceptional--invaluable in urging on revolution, but\r\nuseless, if not dangerous, in quiet times.\r\n\r\nWe would not restrict, control, or take away a single human right or\r\nliberty, which experience showed was already sufficiently governed and\r\nrestricted by public opinion. But we do believe that the slaveholding\r\nSouth is the only country on the globe, that can safely tolerate the\r\nrights and liberties which we have discussed.\r\n\r\nThe annals of revolutionary Virginia were illustrated by three great and\r\nuseful men. The mighty mind of Jefferson, fitted to pull down; the\r\nplastic hand of Madison to build up, and the powerful arm of Washington\r\nto defend, sustain and conserve.\r\n\r\nWe are the friend of popular government, but only so long as\r\nconservatism is the interest of the governing class. At the South, the\r\ninterests and feelings of many non-property holders, are identified with\r\nthose of a comparatively few property holders. It is not necessary to\r\nthe security of property, that a majority of votes should own property;\r\nbut where the pauper majority becomes so large as to disconnect the mass\r\nof them in feeling and interest from the property holding class,\r\nrevolution and agrarianism are inevitable. We will not undertake to say\r\nthat events are tending this way at the North. The absence of laws of\r\nentail and primogeniture may prevent it; yet we fear the worst; for,\r\ndespite the laws of equal inheritance and distribution, wealth is\r\naccumulating in few hands, and pauperism is increasing. We shall attempt\r\nhereafter to show that a system of very small entails might correct this\r\ntendency.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NOMADIC BEGGARS AND PAUPER BANDITTI OF ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder various names, such as Proletariat in France, Lazzaroni in Italy,\r\nLeperos in Mexico, and Gypsies throughout all Europe, free society is\r\ndisturbed and rendered insecure, by the class, a description of which we\r\nshall draw from the British writers. We do not hesitate to assign to the\r\nGypsies the same origin with the rest. They are all the outgrowth of\r\nrunaway and emancipated serfs. The time of the appearance of the Gypsies\r\nis coeval with the universal liberation and escape of the villeins.\r\n\r\nIf this _diluvies_ of society is by nature vicious, nomadic and\r\nincapable of any self-control, it is obvious they should be enslaved. If\r\nemancipation of their ancestors and the throwing them upon the world\r\nwithout property or other means of support, made them and their\r\nposterity, from necessity, beggars, Pariahs and Ishmaelites, they should\r\nbe restored to slavery, unless some better disposition of them can be\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nNorth British Review, \"Literature and Labor Question,\" February No.\r\n1851. The passage we quote is from a work of Mr. Mayhew:\r\n\r\n    \"That we, like the Hottentots, Kaffirs, and Fins, are surrounded\r\n    by wandering hordes, the 'sonquas' and 'fingons' of this country,\r\n    paupers, beggars and outcasts, possessing nothing but what they\r\n    acquire by depredation from the industrious, provident and\r\n    civilized portion of the community; that the heads of these nomads\r\n    are remarkable for a greater development of the jaws and cheek\r\n    bones, than of the skull, and that they have a secret language of\r\n    their own--an English 'cuzecat,' or 'slang,' as it is called, for\r\n    the concealment of their designs; these are points of coincidence\r\n    so striking, that, when placed before the mind, they make us\r\n    marvel why the analogy has been so long unobserved. The\r\n    resemblance once discovered, however, becomes of great service in\r\n    enabling us to use the moral characteristics of the nomadic races\r\n    of other countries, as a means of comprehending more readily those\r\n    of the vagabonds and outcasts of our own. * * * The nomad there is\r\n    distinguished from the civilized man by his repugnance to regular\r\n    and continuous labor--by his want of providence in laying up a\r\n    store for the future; by his inability to perceive consequences\r\n    ever so slightly removed from immediate apprehension; by his\r\n    passion for stultifying herbs and roots, and when possible, for\r\n    intoxicating fermented liquors; for his extraordinary powers of\r\n    enduring privation; by his comparative insensibility to pain; by\r\n    an immoderate love of gaming; frequently risking his own personal\r\n    liberty on a single cast; by his love of libidinous dances; by\r\n    the pleasure which he experiences in witnessing the sufferings of\r\n    sentient creatures; by his delight in warfare and all perilous\r\n    sports; by his desire for vengeance; by the looseness of his\r\n    notions as to property; by the absence of chastity among his\r\n    women, and his disregard of female honor; and lastly by his vague\r\n    sense of religion, his rude idea of a Creator, and utter absence\r\n    of all appreciation of the mercy of the Divine Spirit.\r\n\r\n    \"The nomadic races of England are of many distinct kinds--from the\r\n    habitual vagrant, half beggar, half thief, sleeping in barns,\r\n    tents, and casual wards, to the mechanic on the tramp, obtaining\r\n    his bed and supper from the trade societies in the different towns\r\n    on his way to seek work. Between these two extremes, there are\r\n    several mediate varieties, consisting of pedlars, show-men,\r\n    harvest men, and all that large class who live by either selling,\r\n    showing, or doing something through the country. There are, so to\r\n    speak, the rural nomads--not confining their wanderings to any one\r\n    particular locality, but ranging often from one end of the land to\r\n    the other. Besides these, there are urban and suburban travellers,\r\n    or those who follow some itinerant occupation in and about the\r\n    large towns. Such are in the metropolis, more particularly the\r\n    pickpockets, the beggars, the prostitutes, the street sellers, the\r\n    street performers, the cab-men, the coachmen, the watermen, the\r\n    sailors, and such like. In each of these classes, according as\r\n    they partake more or less of the family vagabond, doing nothing\r\n    whatever for their living, but moving from place to place, preying\r\n    upon the earnings of the more industrious part of the\r\n    community--so will the attributes of the nomad tribe be found to\r\n    be more or less marked.\"\r\n\r\nTo the same effect, read the following from July No. 1852, of Edinburgh\r\nReview, in article on \"Mendicity; its causes and statistics:\"\r\n\r\nThere live, then, in the midst and about all the English population, a\r\ndistinct population, fearful in numbers, constantly and rapidly\r\nincreasing, having a language, manners, and customs of its own--living,\r\nin nine cases out of ten, in a course of life the most immoral and\r\nprofligate; and yet so living, and so increasing, in spite of the laws,\r\nin spite of the municipal arrangements of the last few years, so\r\nfavorable to their detection and punishment; in spite of the new\r\npoor-law arrangements; and in spite of the general feeling that the\r\npoor-rates and the union ought to provide for all real cases of\r\ndestitution and misery. This population has its signs, free-masonry, its\r\nterms of art, its correspondence, its halting-houses, its barns still\r\nkept open, and even well-strawed by farmers and country gentlemen; its\r\npublic-houses, its well-known and even recognized lodging houses; and\r\nits manifold plans to extract or extort, to win or to scold, out of its\r\nreluctant but deceived victims, sums amounting, we are inclined to\r\nbelieve, to not less than L1,375,000; being one-third of the total\r\namount of poor-rates! This sum may at first appear utterly extravagant;\r\nbut it will not be found to be so when it is remembered, that on an\r\naverage each begging family extorts L55 per annum from the public. The\r\nannual poor law expenditure for the year ending in March, 1840, in\r\nEngland, was, in round numbers, L4,300,000. In England, including the\r\nthree ridings of Yorkshire, there are forty-two counties. The population\r\nof those counties is nearly fifteen millions. If we take at this moment\r\na rough and general, though a tolerably correct estimate of that\r\npopulation, with its dense misery in towns and cities, and its diffused\r\nbut not less individually intense misery in the agricultural districts,\r\nwe may fairly calculate that one out of every one hundred is a beggar or\r\nlives in a state of practical vagrancy--looking in one form or other, to\r\nalms for support. The one-hundredth part of the population is 150,000;\r\nand if each begging family, raising L55 per annum from the public by\r\nalms, be estimated as consisting of six, we shall have 25,000 English\r\nbegging families, raising L55 per annum each, or the total sum of\r\nL1,375,000. But we believe that we have underrated, instead of\r\noverstated the facts of the case in these calculations. In London alone\r\nand its vicinity, in spite of all the efforts of the police, a very\r\nlarge part of that sum is extorted; and we have not taken into\r\nconsideration the wholesale mendicity which is now deplorably manifest\r\nin the larger English manufacturing towns. We have also omitted all\r\nIrish mendicants; and yet they are nearly in the proportion of one to\r\nthree in the English agricultural districts. Naturally anxious as we are\r\nto avoid even the appearance of exaggeration, we are still bound to\r\nstate, that the estimate we have made is greatly deficient, and that we\r\nhave understated the real statistics.\r\n\r\nThe begging population of England, existing and increasing in spite of\r\nmunicipal police, and notwithstanding the penalties of the vagrant act,\r\nis divided into several classes; and we now propose to draw upon a\r\nlittle pamphlet, mentioned at the head of this article, which has been\r\nrecently published at Birmingham, and which contains very accurate\r\ndetails of the mendicant population--written by one who long frequented\r\nthe haunts of the vagrant community. The portion of the community to\r\nwhich his details extend, belong principally to the hereditary and\r\nprofessional class of beggars.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this family thus proceeds with his descriptive details:\r\n\r\n    'In order fully to explain each individual character, I shall\r\n    begin with those vagrants who generally obtain the most, and are\r\n    considered of the _first class_, and are by some termed 'Silver\r\n    Beggars,' but by travelers LURKERS.\r\n\r\n    'LURKERS are persons who go about with briefs, containing false\r\n    statements of losses by fire, shipwrecks, accidents, &c. The seals\r\n    and signatures of two or more magistrates are affixed to those\r\n    briefs, and they are so well written, that thousands of persons\r\n    are daily imposed upon by them. As there are so many different\r\n    ways used by these persons, it will be necessary to explain each\r\n    of them separately.'\r\n\r\nThe writer then enters into details as to '_the Fire-Lurkers_,' or\r\nthose, 'who go about begging for loss by fire.' They have false briefs,\r\npretended to be signed by two magistrates and the clergyman of the place\r\nwhere the fire is alleged to have taken place. The documents are\r\naccompanied by a sham subscription-book, and the brief is called, in the\r\nmendicant's parlance, 'a sham,' whilst the subscription-book they name\r\n'a delicate.' With this 'sham and delicate' the 'lurkers,' or beggars,\r\nproceed all over the country; and the author states that one man, with\r\nwhom he was acquainted, 'had been a fire-lurker for fourteen years, and\r\nhad travelled through every county in England, and the greater part of\r\nWales.'\r\n\r\nThen there is,\r\n\r\n    '_The Shipwrecked Sailor's Lurk._--Persons who go on this lurk,\r\n    generally represent themselves as captains or masters of merchant\r\n    ships, which have been wrecked, and they have, of course, lost all\r\n    their property; and their pretended loss always amounts to many\r\n    hundred pounds, sometimes even to thousands. This class of\r\n    impostors are very respectably dressed, having moustaches, gold\r\n    chains, &c.; they have either a well-written brief, or one partly\r\n    printed and filled up with writing and the seals and signatures of\r\n    two or three magistrates are placed at the bottom. I have seen\r\n    briefs of this description from almost every part of the kingdom.'\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say, that one named Captain Johnstone had 'followed the\r\nlurk of a shipwrecked captain for many years, had been over every county\r\nin England and Wales many times, and obtained not only hundreds, but\r\nthousands of pounds.' He relates various anecdotes of the most\r\nsuccessful 'Lurkers' in this department.\r\n\r\n    '_The Foreigner's Lurk._--Considerable numbers proceed on this\r\n    lurk, representing themselves as foreigners in distress.... Of\r\n    late years, by far the greatest number have represented themselves\r\n    as _Polish_ noblemen or gentlemen, who had been driven by the\r\n    tyranny of Russia from their native country to seek a refuge....\r\n    Their briefs have the names and seals of two magistrates attached,\r\n    and are always well written. Whenever they present their briefs,\r\n    they affect not to be able to speak a word of English, and the few\r\n    words they utter are spoken in broken accent.... One of these\r\n    lurkers, known among mendicants by the nickname of 'Lord Dundas,'\r\n    had often got several pounds in a day.... There are also many\r\n    females who go on the foreigner's lurk.... I knew a female who\r\n    went on the foreigner's lurk, who dressed very well; she had a boy\r\n    with her, and often succeeded in getting two or three pounds in a\r\n    day. When she called on any one, she _pattered_ (spoke) in French,\r\n    and affected not to be able to converse in the English language.'\r\n\r\n    4. '_The Accident Lurk._--Lurkers of this description have a sham\r\n    and delicate, (brief and book,) and the sham states, that by some\r\n    dreadful accident the bearer has lost all, or at least the greater\r\n    part of his property, sometimes by storm, and at other times by a\r\n    flood, or in some other way: but, in whatever way the accident has\r\n    happened, the bearer has always suffered a very considerable loss,\r\n    and is deprived of the means of supporting himself and family. The\r\n    sums raised vary from five shillings to a pound per day.'\r\n\r\n    5. '_The Sick Lurk._--This is worked in so many different ways,\r\n    that it will be necessary to say a little on each. It would seem,\r\n    1st, That a common method of imposing upon the public is, by\r\n    applying blistering ointment to the arms, causing them to have the\r\n    appearance of having been badly scalded. 2d, That others go about\r\n    with hands and arms tied up, said to be injured by lightning, or\r\n    by some other deplorable accident. 3d, Others affect fits. 4th,\r\n    Others affect pregnancy and destitution. 5th, Others obtain alms\r\n    by the husband remaining at home and affecting indisposition, in\r\n    case any one should visit his lodgings to examine into the merits\r\n    of the case, whilst the wife goes out begging for wine, rags,\r\n    clothes, &c., for the sham invalid. 6th, Others pretend to have\r\n    bad wounds, and beg for linen rags and small bottles to contain\r\n    medicine necessary for their cure. I saw a man who got, in one\r\n    day, by this means, thirteen pounds' weight of white rags, and\r\n    more than five dozen of phial bottles. Rags and bottles sell well.\r\n    7th, Others affect to have children confined with scarlet fever,\r\n    &c. &c, and beg for _them_. They state that they have obtained a\r\n    note to take their children to an infirmary or to an hospital, and\r\n    want a few clothes and a little money.'\r\n\r\n    6. '_The Deaf and Dumb Lurk._--I have known many persons of both\r\n    sexes, who have acted as if deaf and dumb, and by this means\r\n    succeeded very well in obtaining money, food, &c. Many of them\r\n    pretend to tell fortunes, and frequently get something\r\n    considerable by such practices. They carry a slate and pencil with\r\n    them, to write questions and answers.'\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the pamphlet before us, that sometimes these deaf\r\nand dumb lurkers affect even in the lodging-houses to be thus afflicted;\r\nbut in such cases they are generally found out by their fellow vagrants.\r\n\r\n    7. '_The Servants' Lurk._--There are considerable numbers who go\r\n    on the servants' lurk, or as servants out of place; and both males\r\n    and females frequently succeed well in imposing on servants and\r\n    others by false statements and tales of distress.... The greater\r\n    part of those who go on this lurk are neatly dressed, and have\r\n    exactly the appearance of servants in gentlemen's families....\r\n    Many of them have the _Court Guide_, which, as it contains a list\r\n    of the nobility and gentry, enables them to do the thing\r\n    completely.'\r\n\r\n    8. '_Collier's Lurk._--This is followed by thousands who were\r\n    never in a coal-pit, and numbers of such are daily imposing upon\r\n    the public as colliers out of employ. They generally say they have\r\n    been thrown out of work by some accident, such as the flooding of\r\n    the works or the falling in of the pit.... They often go in\r\n    parties from two to seven or eight.... Others have printed papers,\r\n    which are left at each house, and called for again in a few\r\n    hours.... Others have written statements of the pretended masters\r\n    of the accidents, and the supposed signatures of the works are\r\n    affixed to them.... Some of those obtain as much as fourteen or\r\n    fifteen shillings per diem.'\r\n\r\n    9. '_The Weaver's Lurk._--There are at the present time great\r\n    numbers who go on this lurk, many of them having printed papers or\r\n    small handbills, and leave one at each house, and then call again\r\n    for them, and to receive what persons are disposed to give.... I\r\n    have seen men who represented themselves as weavers of every kind,\r\n    and from all the manufacturing parts of the kingdom--men who I\r\n    well knew had never been near a loom, but had been born and bred\r\n    vagrants.'\r\n\r\n    10. '_The Cotton Spinner's Lurk._--There are many going on this\r\n    lurk with printed papers or small handbills also.... Some who go\r\n    on this lurk carry sewing cotton for sale, alleged to be their own\r\n    spinning.... One man I know, who travels on this lurk, has been\r\n    doing so for twelve years. He sometimes obtains as much as from\r\n    twelve to fifteen shillings in one day.'\r\n\r\n    11. '_The Calenderer's Lurk._--Those who go on this lurk represent\r\n    themselves as calenderer's out of employ, through the depression\r\n    of trade and improvement in machinery. They, like sham weavers and\r\n    colliers, have false papers, which are printed, some in poetry.'\r\n\r\nThe sums raised by these descriptions of 'lurks' must be immense,\r\nespecially where the individuals have a good address, and can explain\r\nand enforce the written and printed appeals they take with them.\r\n\r\n    'HIGH-FLIERS,' or begging letter writers, are, it would seem, the\r\n    next in order of importance, after the Lurkers. 'These begging\r\n    letter-writers scribble false statements of their having been\r\n    unfortunate in business, or suffered great losses, which have\r\n    reduced them to a state of extreme distress. In London, but\r\n    especially in the watering and sea-bathing places, these letters\r\n    procure as much as from five to one pound per day.'\r\n\r\n    'SHALLOW COVES' are 'impostors begging through the country as\r\n    shipwrecked sailors. They generally choose winter, and always go\r\n    nearly naked. Their object in doing so is to obtain left-off\r\n    clothes.... They have a long, pitiful got-up tale of pretended\r\n    distress, which they shout through the streets, of having been\r\n    shipwrecked, &c.... Shallow Coves generally go in _companies_,\r\n    (or, technically speaking, in _school_) of from two to ten. There\r\n    is generally one selected to be the spokesman.... As Shallow Coves\r\n    only call at respectable houses, they often obtain a great deal of\r\n    money.'\r\n\r\n    '_Shallow Motts_' are females who, like the Shallow Coves, go\r\n    nearly naked. They also adopt that mode of begging in order to\r\n    obtain wearing apparel.... They plead long and severe sickness,\r\n    but only ask for _clothes_. The clothes are disposed of as soon as\r\n    possible, none being ever kept for their own use.... I knew one of\r\n    these who in ten days obtained at Kingston-upon-Thames between\r\n    seven and eight pounds' worth of clothes.\r\n\r\n    'CADGERS' are those who make begging their trade, and depend upon\r\n    it for their support. _Cadgers on the downright_ are those who beg\r\n    from door to door, and _Cadgers on the fly_ are those who beg as\r\n    they pass along the tober, (road.) Cadging on the fly is a\r\n    profitable occupation in the vicinity of bathing-places and large\r\n    towns. A person of this description generally gets many shillings\r\n    in the course of the clay. Cadging on the downright (from door to\r\n    door) is like all other trades, getting worse; but still thousands\r\n    do very well at it, and frequently get more food than they can\r\n    consume.... I have often seen food, which many working people\r\n    would gladly have eaten, shamefully and wantonly wasted.\r\n\r\n    'CADGERS CHILDREN' (kiddies) 'are so well instructed in the arts\r\n    of imposition by their parents, that they frequently obtain more\r\n    in money and food than grown-up cadgers.'\r\n\r\n    '_Cadgers' Screeving_.--There are many cadgers who write short\r\n    sentences with chalk on the flags, and some of them can do it\r\n    remarkably well; these are called _screevers_. I have seen the\r\n    following sentences frequently written by them in places where\r\n    there were numbers passing by, and where they thought it would be\r\n    likely to get plenty of half-pence, (browns,) and now and then a\r\n    _tanner_ or a _bob_, (sixpence or a shilling,)\r\n\r\n      \"Hunger is a sharp thorn, and biteth keen.\"\r\n      \"I cannot get work, and to beg I am ashamed.\"\r\n\r\n    I have known them by this means obtain seven shillings a day.\r\n\r\n    '_Cadgers' Sitting Pad._--Whenever cadgers _stand_ or _sit_,\r\n    either in towns or by the road side, to beg, they call it\r\n    _sitting_ or _standing pad_; and this often proves a very\r\n    profitable method. Some of them affect blindness; whilst others\r\n    represent themselves as unable to follow any employment, in\r\n    consequence of being subject to fits. Some cadgers save very\r\n    considerable sums of money; but these are very few, compared with\r\n    the great number who live by this trade of beggary.\r\n\r\n    '_Match-sellers_' never entirely depend upon selling matches, for\r\n    they cadge as well; in fact, they only carry matches as a cloak\r\n    for begging, and never offer them at any house where they expect\r\n    to get more without them.... Match-sellers, as well as all other\r\n    cadgers, often get what they call '_a back-door cant_;' that is,\r\n    anything they can carry off where they beg, or offer their matches\r\n    for sale.'\r\n\r\n    'CROSS COVES,' though they beg their bread, can tell a long story\r\n    about being out of employ through the badness of trade, &c., yet\r\n    get what they call _on the cross_, (by theft.).... One of their\r\n    chief modes of getting things _on the cross_ is by shoplifting,\r\n    (called grabbing,).... Another method is to _star the glaze_, (i.\r\n    e. break or cut the window.)\r\n\r\n    '_Prigs_ (or pickpockets) are another class of vagrants, and they\r\n    frequent races, fairs, and prize-fights.... Like cross coves, they\r\n    are generally young men who have been trained to vagrancy, and\r\n    have been taught the arts of their profession in their childhood.'\r\n\r\n    '_Palmers_ are another description of beggars, who visit shops\r\n    under pretence of collecting _harp_ half-pence; and to induce\r\n    shopkeepers to search for them, they offer thirteen-pence for a\r\n    shilling's worth, when many persons are silly enough to empty a\r\n    large quantity of copper on their counters to search for the\r\n    half-pence wanted. The _palmer_ is sure to have his hand amongst\r\n    it; and while he pretends to search for the harps, he contrives to\r\n    conceal as many as possible in the palm of his hand, and whenever\r\n    he removes his hand from the coppers on the counter, always holds\r\n    his fingers out straight, so that the shopkeeper has not the least\r\n    suspicion that he is being robbed. Sums varying from five to\r\n    fifteen shillings per diem are frequently got in this way, by\r\n    characters of that description.'\r\n\r\n\r\nExtract from Edinburgh Review, Jan. No. 1844:\r\n\r\nIRISH PEASANTRY.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the insecurity of a community in which the bulk of\r\nthe population form a conspiracy against the law, must prevent the\r\nimportation of capital; must occasion much of what is accumulated there\r\nto be exported; and must diminish the motives and the means of\r\naccumulation. Who will send his property to a place where he cannot rely\r\non its being protected? Who will voluntarily establish himself in a\r\ncountry which to-morrow may be in a state of disturbance? A state in\r\nwhich, to use the words of Chief Justice Bushe, 'houses, and barns, and\r\ngranaries are leveled, crops are laid waste, pasture lands are ploughed,\r\nplantations are torn up, meadows are thrown open to cattle, cattle are\r\nmaimed, tortured, killed; persons are visited by parties of banditti,\r\nwho inflict cruel torture, mutilate their limbs, or beat them almost to\r\ndeath; men who have in any way become obnoxious to the insurgents, or\r\nopposed their system, or refused to participate in their outrages, are\r\ndeliberately assassinated in the open day; and sometimes the unoffending\r\nmembers of a family are indiscriminately murdered by burning the\r\nhabitation.\" A state in which even those best able to protect\r\nthemselves, the gentry, are forced to build up all their lower windows\r\nwith stone and mortar; to admit light only into one sitting-room, and\r\nnot into all the windows of that room, to fortify every other inlet by\r\nbullet proof barricadoes; to station sentinels around during all the\r\nnight, and the greater part of the day; and to keep fire-arms in all the\r\nbedrooms, and even on the side-table at breakfast and dinner time. Well\r\nmight even Bishop Doyle exclaim--\"I do not blame the absentees; I would\r\nbe an absentee myself if I could.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\"RURAL LIFE OF ENGLAND.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom \"Rural Life of England,\" by WM. H. HOWITT, we take the following\r\nextract:\r\n\r\n    \"The wildness into which some of these children in the more\r\n    solitary parts of the country, grow, (recollect this is in\r\n    Lancashire, near the great city of Manchester,) is, I imagine, not\r\n    to be surpassed in any of the back settlements of America. On the\r\n    5th July, 1836, the day of that remarkable thunder-storm which\r\n    visited a great part of the kingdom with much fury, being driven\r\n    into a cottage at the foot of Pendle by the coming on of this\r\n    storm, and while standing at the door watching its progress, I\r\n    observed the head of some human creature, carefully protruded from\r\n    the doorway of an adjacent shed, and as suddenly withdrawn on\r\n    being observed. To ascertain what sort of a person it belonged to,\r\n    I went into the shed, but at first found it too dark to enable me\r\n    to discover anything. Presently, however, as objects became\r\n    visible, I saw a little creature, apparently a girl about ten\r\n    years old, reared very erectly against the opposite wall. On\r\n    accosting her in a kind tone, and telling her to come forward and\r\n    not be afraid, she advanced from the wall, and behold! there stood\r\n    another little creature, about the head shorter, whom she had been\r\n    concealing. I asked the elder child, whether this younger one were\r\n    a girl. She answered, 'Ne'a.' 'Was it a boy?' 'Ne'a.' 'What!\r\n    neither boy nor girl? Was she a girl herself?' 'Ne'a.' 'What! was\r\n    it a boy I was speaking to?' 'Ne'a.' 'What in the name of wonder\r\n    were they then?' 'We are childer.' 'Childer! and was the woman in\r\n    the house their mother?' 'Ne'a.' 'Who was she, then?' 'Ar mam.'\r\n    'O! your mam! and do you keep cows in this shed?' 'Ne'a,--bee-as.'\r\n    In short, common English was quite unintelligible to these poor\r\n    little creatures, and their appearance was as wild as their\r\n    speech. They were two fine young creatures,\r\n    nevertheless,--especially the elder, whose form and face were full\r\n    of that symmetry and fine grace that are sometimes the growth of\r\n    unrestrained Nature, and would have delighted the sculptor or\r\n    painter. Their only clothing was a sort of little boddice with\r\n    skirts, made of a reddish stuff, and rendered more picturesque by\r\n    sundry patches of scarlet cloth, no doubt from their mother's old\r\n    cloak. Their heads, bosoms, and legs to the knees, were bare to\r\n    all the influences of earth and heaven; and on giving each of them\r\n    a penny, they bounded off with the fleetness and elasticity of\r\n    young roes. No doubt the hills and the heaths, the wild flowers of\r\n    summer, and the swift waters of the glens, were the only live long\r\n    day companions of these children, who came home only to their\r\n    oatmeal dinner, and a bed as simple as their garments. Imagine the\r\n    violent change of life by _the sudden capture and confinement of\r\n    these little English savages in the night-and-day noise, labor,\r\n    and foul atmosphere of the cotton purgatories_!\r\n\r\n    \"In the immediate neighborhood of towns, many of the swelling\r\n    ranges of hills present a much more cultivated aspect, and delight\r\n    the eye with their smooth, green, and flowing outlines; and the\r\n    valleys, almost everywhere, are woody, watered with clear, rapid\r\n    streams, and in short, are beautiful. But along the rise of the\r\n    tall chimneys of vast and innumerable factories, and even while\r\n    looking on the places of the master manufactories, with their\r\n    woods, and gardens, and shrubbery lawns around them, _one cannot\r\n    help thinking of the horrors detailed before the committee of the\r\n    House of Commons, respecting the Factory System_; of the\r\n    parentless and friendless wretches, sent by wagon loads from\r\n    distant work-houses to these prisons of labor and despair; of the\r\n    young frames crushed to the dust by incessant labor; of the beds\r\n    into which one set of children got, as another set got out, so\r\n    that they were said never to be cold the whole year round, till\r\n    contagious fires burnt out and swept away by hundreds these little\r\n    victims of Mammon's ever-urging never-ceasing wheel. Beautiful as\r\n    are many of these wild recesses, where, before the introduction of\r\n    steam, the dashing rivulet invited the cotton-spinners to erect\r\n    their mills; and curious as the remains of those simple original\r\n    factories are, with their one great water-wheel, which turned\r\n    their spindles while there was water, but during the drought of\r\n    summer quite as often stood still; yet one is haunted even there,\r\n    among the shadows of the fine old trees that throw their arms\r\n    athwart streams dashing down their beds of solid rock, by the\r\n    memory of little tender children, that never knew pity or\r\n    kindness, but labored on and on, through noon and through\r\n    midnight, till they slept and yet mechanically worked, and were\r\n    often awaked only by the horrid machinery rending off their limbs.\r\n    In places like these, where now the old factories and large houses\r\n    of the proprietors, stand deserted, or are inhabited by troops of\r\n    poor creatures, whose poverty only makes them appear the more\r\n    desolate. We are told by such men as Mr. Fielden, of Oldham, once\r\n    a factory child himself, and now a great manufacturer, who dares\r\n    to reveal the secrets of the prison-house, that little children\r\n    have even committed suicide to escape from a life worse than ten\r\n    deaths. And what a mighty system is this now become? What a\r\n    perpetual and vast supply of human energy and human life it\r\n    requires, with all the facilities of improved machinery, with all\r\n    the developed power of steam, and with all the glowing thirst of\r\n    wealth to urge it on! We are told that the state of the factories\r\n    is improved, and I trust they are; but if there be any truth in\r\n    the evidence given before the Parliamentary committees, there is\r\n    need of great amelioration yet; and it is, when we recollect these\r\n    things, how completely the laboring class has, in these districts,\r\n    been regarded as mere machinery for the accumulation of enormous\r\n    capitals, that we cease to wonder at their uncouth and degraded\r\n    aspect, and at the neglect in which they are suffered to swarm\r\n    over these hills, like the very weeds of humanity, cast out into\r\n    disregarded places, and left to spread and increase in rank and\r\n    deleterious luxuriance.\"\r\n\r\nWhat is so poetically and graphically described by Mr. Hewitt, is\r\nverified in its minutest details in the \"Glory and Shame of England,\"\r\na very interesting work by C. Edwards Lester, an abolitionist of New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE DISTRESSED NEEDLE-WOMEN AND HOOD'S SONG OF THE SHIRT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe take what follows from the January No., 1849, of the Westminster\r\nReview--we having nothing to remark, except as to the line from the\r\nFrench song, which has taken the place of the Marseilloise as the great\r\nNational Song, we should rather say, National Dirge. It is the maddening\r\ncry of hunger for employment and bread, and more resembles the howl of\r\nthe wolves of the Pyrennes, as they start in quest of prey, than the\r\nAnthem of Liberty. It truly represents, embodies and personifies the\r\ngreat Socialistic movement of the day. Whilst statesmen and philosophers\r\nspeculate, the mass agitate, organize and threaten. Winter before last,\r\nthey took possession of the streets of New York, and levied enforced\r\ncharity. This spring, they meet in the Park and resolve, \"that there\r\nwere fifty thousand men and women in vain seeking employment during the\r\nlast inclement winter. America echoes to France, \"Vivre en travaillant,\r\nou mourir en combatant!\" 'Tis the tocsin and the watchword of free\r\nsociety. 'Tis the grumbling noise of the heaving volcano, that\r\nthreatens and precedes a social eruption greater than the world has yet\r\nwitnessed. But let us give the language of the Reviewer:\r\n\r\n    \"The question of human misery--its causes and their removal, is at\r\n    the bottom of the movement which is now convulsing Europe, and\r\n    which threatens to agitate it for some time to come. Could some\r\n    practicable scheme of relief, generally acceptable to all classes\r\n    and adequate to cope with the magnitude of the evil, be but\r\n    suggested, what a load of anxiety would be taken from the mind of\r\n    many a Minister of State!--what comfort would be offered to many a\r\n    desponding philanthropist!\r\n\r\n    \"Human misery has at last found tongues and pens to make itself\r\n    heard and felt. It appeals to our feelings and our understandings,\r\n    to our sympathies and fears. Its wails melt us to pity, its\r\n    ravings terrify us, its woes sicken us. It will no longer hide\r\n    itself. We must either remove it, or submit to have it constantly\r\n    exposed to our gaze in all its horrid deformity.\r\n\r\n    \"Hitherto the comfortable classes have virtually answered the\r\n    bitter complaints of the uncomfortable classes in some such terms\r\n    as these: 'Poor people! we are very sorry for your suffering--we\r\n    really feel for you--take this trifle--it will be some relief. We\r\n    wish we could do more;--and now pray be quiet--don't distress\r\n    us with your writhings and agonies--resign yourselves to the\r\n    will of Providence, and bear hunger and cold in peace and\r\n    seclusion;--above all, attempt no violence, or we must use\r\n    violence to keep you quiet.' The answer of the uncomfortable\r\n    classes to such admonitions, day by day becoming more\r\n    unmistakable, is: 'Relieve us, relieve us! Make us comfortable, or\r\n    show us how we may make ourselves comfortable: otherwise we must\r\n    make you uncomfortable. We will be comfortable or uncomfortable\r\n    together.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Vivre en travaillant, ou mourir en combatant.' In our last\r\n    number, we ventured to offer a few indications as to what we\r\n    considered a part, an important part, of the remedial measures to\r\n    be resorted to for the prevention of human misery. We were then\r\n    dealing with that question as a whole. We now propose to address\r\n    ourselves to miseries of a class.\r\n\r\n    \"The sufferings of the distressed needle-woman have obtained an\r\n    infamous notoriety--they are a scandal to our age and a reproach\r\n    to our boasted civilization. They have been clothed in language at\r\n    once truthful and impressive, full of pathos and yet free from\r\n    exaggeration. Well known as Hood's immortal lines may be, we\r\n    reproduce them here, because no narrative, no statistics of ours,\r\n    could be more true nor half so much to the purpose:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF THE SHIRT.\r\n\r\n  \"With fingers weary and worn,\r\n    With eyelids heavy and red,\r\n  A woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\r\n    Plying her needle and thread.\r\n  Stitch--stitch--stitch!\r\n    In poverty, hunger, and dirt;\r\n  And still, with a voice of dolorous pitch,\r\n    She sang the 'Song of the Shirt!'\r\n\r\n  \"Work--work--work!\r\n    While the cock is crowing aloof!\r\n  And work--work--work!\r\n    Till the stars shine through the roof!\r\n  It's O! to be a slave,\r\n    Along with the barbarous Turk,\r\n  Where woman has never a soul to save,\r\n    If this is Christian work!\r\n\r\n  \"Work--work--work!\r\n    Till the brain begins to swim;\r\n  Work--work--work!\r\n    Till the eyes are heavy and dim!\r\n  Seam and gusset and band,\r\n    Band and gusset and seam,\r\n  Till o'er the buttons I fall asleep,\r\n    And sew them on in a dream!\r\n\r\n  \"O! men, with sisters dear!\r\n    O! men, with mothers and wives,\r\n  It is not linen you're wearing out!\r\n    But human creatures' lives!\r\n  Stitch--stitch--stitch!\r\n    In poverty, hunger, and dirt;\r\n  Sewing at once, with a double thread,\r\n    A shroud as well as a shirt!\r\n\r\n  \"But why do I talk of death?\r\n    That phantom of grisly bone?\r\n  I hardly fear his terrible shape,\r\n    It seems so like my own!\r\n  It seems so like my own,\r\n    Because of the fasts I keep--\r\n  Oh, God! that bread should be so dear,\r\n    And flesh and blood so cheap!\r\n\r\n  \"Work--work--work!\r\n    My labor never flags;\r\n  And what are its wages?

I must demand of my reader that he come\r\nto the perusal, the _beau ideal_ of a juryman. No information that he\r\nhas gained elsewhere, no feelings that he has cherished as virtues, no\r\nsentiments that he has cultivated as noble, and no opinions that he may\r\nhave formed as infallible, must interfere with his purely and simply\r\nreceiving the following arguments on their own cogency and truth alone.\r\n\r\nThe writer considers he has made a great discovery in moral and\r\npolitical science; and elevated by his subject above all personal\r\ninfluences, he commits it to be worked out by others, without the\r\nostentation of recording his name, or deeming that the applause of\r\npresent or of future generations can add to his sublime delight, in\r\ndiscovering and applying a \"panacea\" to the varied and bitter ills that\r\nbeset three-fourths of the poor inhabitants of the \"_United_ Kingdom.\"\r\n\r\nAs some account of the means by which a great discovery has been arrived\r\nat is necessary, in order to prepare the mind for its reception with due\r\nrespect, I shall give a brief outline of the process by which this\r\nall-important truth was elicited.\r\n\r\nBorn with natural sensibilities, I early learnt to shrink from pain\r\nendured by others, as if felt actually and bodily by myself. Thus\r\nconstituted, what a scene was displayed to me when I came into the great\r\nand moving society of mankind! What mighty heaps of misery did I\r\ndiscern! What details did the records of the various courts of justice\r\ndisclose! What regions of squalor, misery, and degradation did my\r\ntravels reveal to me in every city, and every hamlet, I visited! The\r\nbent of my future avocation was soon fixed, and I became a\r\nphilanthropist by profession. Not to make a trade of it at monster\r\nmeetings, or fancy fairs, but as a pursuit to which I felt myself called\r\nby a spiritual voice, as distinct, I should say, as that which ever\r\ncalled a theologian from a curacy of fifty pounds a year to a bishopric\r\nof twenty thousand.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to recapitulate the horrors I have witnessed in the\r\nregions of poverty. It is said that the eras of pestilence and famine\r\nare passed, but so will not those say who have visited the dwellings of\r\nthe operatives of our great manufacturing towns, when the markets are\r\nglutted, and the mills and manufactories are closed. Pestilence still\r\nrages fiercely as ever, in the form of typhus, engendered by want. In\r\nthe mission I have called myself to, I have stood upon the mud floor,\r\nover the corpse of the mother and the new-born child--both the victims\r\nof want. I have seen a man (God's image) stretched on straw, wrapped\r\nonly in a mat, resign his breath, from starvation, in the prime of age.\r\nI have entered, on a sultry summer's night, a small house, situate on\r\nthe banks of a common sewer, wherein one hundred and twenty-seven human\r\nbeings, of both sexes and all ages, were indiscriminately crowded. I\r\nhave been in the pestilential hovels of our great manufacturing cities,\r\nwhere life was corrupted in every possible mode, from the malaria of the\r\nsewer to the poison of the gin-bottle. I have been in sheds of the\r\npeasant, worse than the hovel of the Russian, where eight squalid,\r\ndirty, boorish creatures were to be kept alive by eight shillings per\r\nweek, irregularly paid. I have seen the humanities of life desecrated in\r\nevery way. I have seen the father snatch the bread from his child, and\r\nthe mother offer the gin-bottle for the breast. I have seen, too,\r\ngenerous sacrifices and tender considerations, to which the boasted\r\nchivalries of Sydney and Edward were childish ostentation. I have found\r\nwrong so exalted, and right so debased--I have seen and known of so much\r\nmisery, that the faith in good has shivered within me.\r\n\r\nFor a time, when I urged these things in the circles of the comfortable,\r\nI received many various replies. By some it was said that it was the lot\r\nof humanity--that it had always been so, and, therefore, always must.\r\nThat to enlarge on the evil was only to create discontent, and so injure\r\n\"the better classes.\" It was in vain I urged to these reasoners that for\r\nhundreds, and, perhaps, thousands of years, creatures little better than\r\nCalibans infested the morasses and forests of Europe. That civilization\r\nhad an onward progress, and that the history of the world proved the one\r\ngreat truth--that man is the creature of circumstances. By some, the\r\nevils were denied: by some few, deplored. By all, the discussion was\r\navoided; though the destruction that menaced the Roman empire from the\r\ninvasion of the barbarian world was never so imminent, nor could the\r\nconsequence be so dreadful, as that which the wealthy, and civilization\r\nitself, would sustain from the insurrection of outraged poverty.\r\n\r\nI next tried the politicians. I devoted some years to history and\r\npolitical economy. I even entered the senate. In politics, I found no\r\nmeans of relief. The struggle there was for the preponderance in power,\r\nand the reply, \"Help us to get into power, and then we will see what we\r\ncan do.\" The utmost was to institute inquiries; and from the information\r\nthus gathered, has been collected a record of misery, such as never was\r\nbefore displayed.\r\n\r\nIt is true, some steps have at last been taken in the right direction;\r\nsome few noble spirits have spoken out to the \"comfortable,\" the\r\ndreadful truths. That something must be done, is now acknowledged by all\r\nwho think. The foolish, the careless, and the truculent, can no longer\r\navowedly declare the cries and groans of the miserable multitude to be\r\nseditious discontent; nor ascribe their sufferings to the results of\r\nretributive justice.\r\n\r\nBaffled in every search for a remedy at home, I determined to search\r\nforeign nations, and having carefully journeyed through Europe, I sought\r\nsuccessively the East and West, until I had traversed the civilized\r\ncountries of the world. It was in the remote regions of the East and\r\nWest that I found a clue to my discovery. I here found mankind as\r\nmultitudinous as at home, but much more happy. Starvation, except in\r\ncases of general famine, was unknown; and, on the contrary, I heard the\r\nsounds of revelry and dancing, of mirth and leisure, amongst the lowest\r\nclasses. How different to the everlasting toil of the superior\r\nEnglishman! \"These, then,\" I said, \"are the concomitants of bondage!\"\r\nHaving thus struck out the idea, I followed it up with logical severity,\r\nand enunciated the truth that _slavery and content, and liberty and\r\ndiscontent, are natural results of each other_. Applying this, then, to\r\nthe toil-worn, half-fed, pauperized population of England, I found that\r\nthe only way to permanently and efficiently remedy the complicated\r\nevils, would be to ENSLAVE _the whole of the people of England who have\r\nnot property_.\r\n\r\nOf course, I expect a shout of execration and contempt at such a bold\r\nproposition; but, as I have already said, I seek only to gain the\r\nhearing, at first, of the impartial and the original thinker. That I am\r\ndisinterested, will at once be allowed, when I declare I do not seek to\r\nbe one of the enslaved. But let us proceed to examine how this mighty\r\nbenefit would manifest itself. The first great advantage would be, that\r\nthe lower classes of society would be placed on an equality with the\r\ndomestic animals; and by becoming property, become valuable and valued.\r\nAt present there can be no doubt that a horse that is worth fifty pounds\r\nis much more cared for than a man who is worth nothing. We have lately\r\nseen a case where a woman was allowed to expire in parturition, because\r\nno more than eight shillings was allowed for the midwife's fee; whereas,\r\nwhen a famous racing mare foaled, ten guineas were not thought too great\r\na sum to secure the attendance of a first-rate veterinary surgeon. Now,\r\nhad the woman been a slave, her offspring would have been worth\r\nsomething, and, of course, her safety secured.\r\n\r\nLike all great discoveries, the ramifications of the advantages are\r\nfound to be endless, and, if once fully entertained, would be\r\nirresistible. Entire and complete slavery of the poor would put an end\r\nto all the discussions of their rights, and clearly and definitely work\r\nout the relative duties of all classes. We should have no more occasion\r\nfor vague special pleading, such as we find in Paley and other moral\r\nphilosophers, who endeavor to reconcile dependence and independence, and\r\nliberty and obedience. Sedition would be at once annihilated; for where\r\nthere was no hope nor recognition of equality, there would be no attempt\r\nto raise claims which were stifled before born. All vain ambition, such\r\nas that now subsisting, between the potboy and the peer, as manifested\r\nin Chesterfield's mosaic gold and cigars, would be prevented. The potboy\r\nwould be a contented slave, and the peer left to his superiority in\r\nclothes, trinkets, and sensualities.\r\n\r\nIt will of course be asserted that the people would not be contented as\r\nslaves, but it is only to make a state inevitable, and humanity is soon\r\nreconciled to it, as we are to death, governments, and the income-tax.\r\nBesides, what is liberty? a word now almost forgotten; a battle sound\r\nused to juggle men in every age and country; in Greece, Rome, and\r\nAmerica, the war-cry of slaves to fight for the liberty of slavery. Must\r\nwe, then, ever remain the tools of words; reject all the true advantages\r\nof slavery because we cannot bear the name, and take all its evils, and\r\nmore, because we wish to renounce the sound? What are soldiers and\r\nsailors but bondsmen? Indeed, they are a happy specimen of slavery; well\r\nfed, clad, and tended; with plenty of leisure and repose. Why, then,\r\nshould they be happier than the peasant, who pines away his dreary\r\nexistence on bread and potatoes and water? What is the convict but a\r\nslave, who by his crimes has earned his right to be kept well and safe\r\nfrom the elements and want? We reward the criminal with slavery and\r\ncompetence, and leave the honest man to liberty and want.\r\n\r\nIf, indeed, the old noble cry of \"Liberty _and Beer_\" could be realized,\r\nthen it were vain to urge my discovery; but as Englishmen, in proportion\r\nas they have gained their liberty, have lost their beer, it behooves us\r\nto see whether they had not better hasten back to that state, when\r\ninventoried with their masters' swine they shared also their\r\nsuperfluities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nTHE EDINBURGH REVIEW ON SOUTHERN SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Edinburgh Review well knows that the white laborers of England\r\nreceive more blows than are inflicted on Southern slaves. In the Navy,\r\nthe Army, and the Merchant service of England, there is more of cruelty,\r\nmore physical discomfort, than on all the farms of the South. This\r\nReview, for twenty years, has been a grand repository of the ignorance,\r\nthe crimes, and sufferings of the workers in mines and factories, of the\r\nagricultural laborers, of the apprentices, and, in fine, of the whole\r\nlaboring class of England. We might appeal to its pages almost _passim_\r\nto establish these facts. Half the time of Parliament is consumed in\r\nvain efforts to alleviate the condition of the cruelly-treated, and\r\nstarving poor; and much of this Review is taken up in chronicling the\r\nhumane, but fruitless action of Parliament. No man in the South, we are\r\nsure, ever bred slaves for sale. They are always sold reluctantly, and\r\ngenerally from necessity, or as a punishment for misconduct. The\r\nSouth-West has been settled in great part by farmers from the older\r\nslave States, removing to them with their negroes. The breaking up of\r\nfamilies of whites and of blacks keeps equal pace. But we have no law\r\nof impressment in the South to sever the family ties of either blacks or\r\nwhites. Nor have we any slavery half so cruel as that to which the\r\nimpressed English seaman is subjected. The soldiers torn from their\r\nwives and children, to suffer and to perish in every clime and on every\r\nsea, excite not the sympathies of the Reviewer; they are all reserved\r\nfor imaginary cases of distress, occasioned by the breaking up of\r\nfamilies of Southern negroes. The so-called slave trade of the South is\r\nno evil, because the instances of the improper severing of family ties\r\nare rare. Will some Yankee or Englishman, ere the charge is repeated\r\nthat slaves are bred to be sold like horses, when they are old enough\r\nfor market, point out a single instance in the present, or the past, of\r\na Southerner's pursuing such a business? Yankees and Englishmen kill\r\ntheir wives annually, yet it has not occurred to Englishmen at all, and\r\nnot to the Yankee till very lately, to abolish the marriage relation.\r\nWhen Englishmen correct the thousand real and pressing evils in their\r\nsociety, it will be time enough to call on us to do away with the\r\nimaginary abuses of slavery. These remarks have been elicited from us by\r\nan article on Southern slavery, in the April number of the Edinburgh\r\nReview, which is equally distinguished for the falsity of its charges\r\nand the ill nature of its comments. As a full justification for the\r\nindefinite continuance of negro slavery, we give below an extract from\r\nan able article from the same Review, in its January number, 1846,\r\nentitled \"Legislation for the working classes.\" In showing the many\r\nevils arising from emancipating the whites, the Reviewer demonstrates,\r\nthough not intending it, the absurdity of emancipating negroes. If\r\nIrishmen, who are as intellectual a race of men as any in all Europe,\r\nhave lost infinitely in physical comfort, and gained nothing in morals\r\nor in mind by liberty, what will it avail negroes? Let Hayti and Jamaica\r\nanswer. But Frenchmen, Scotchmen and Englishmen, we mean the masses, the\r\nproletariat, have lost as much by emancipation as Irishmen. History and\r\nstatistics, the jails, the gallows, and the poor-house tell the same sad\r\ntale everywhere. We would be willing, if necessary, to rest the complete\r\njustification of negro slavery on this single extract:\r\n\r\n    [From the Edinburgh Review, 1846.]\r\n\r\n    The moral and domestic feelings of the slave are sacrificed, and\r\n    his intellect is stunted; but in respect of his physical condition\r\n    he may be a gainer. \"It is necessary,\" says Aristotle, in his\r\n    celebrated justification of slavery, \"that those who cannot exist\r\n    separately should live together. he who is capable of foreseeing\r\n    by his intellect, is naturally a master; he who is able to execute\r\n    with his body what another contrives, is naturally a slave:\r\n    wherefore the interest of the master and slave is one.\" There is a\r\n    certain degree of force in this argument, if it is limited to the\r\n    economical relations of the two parties. It is the interest of the\r\n    master to maintain his slave in good working order. In general,\r\n    therefore, he is comparatively well fed, clothed and lodged; his\r\n    physical wants are provided for; his food descends into his mouth\r\n    like the manna in the wilderness; he is clothed like the lilies of\r\n    the field; he has no thought or care for the morrow. Although\r\n    complaints were made of insufficient food and overwork, the\r\n    arguments against negro slavery in our West India colonies were\r\n    founded, mainly, on the necessity of constant punishment--on the\r\n    _driving system_, as it was called--and the cruelty of the\r\n    inflictions. The Report of the French Commission, framed by the\r\n    Due de Broglie, which recommended the gradual abolition of\r\n    slavery, likewise bears testimony to the excellent physical\r\n    condition of the slaves in the French colonies. It is on account\r\n    of the advantages which may belong to dependence upon a wealthy\r\n    lord, as compared with a needy independence, that the slave in\r\n    Menander exclaims, that \"it is better to obtain a good master,\r\n    than to live meanly and wretchedly as a freeman.\" So the\r\n    Rhetorician Libanus, who lived in the fourth century, in a\r\n    declamation entitled a _Vituperation of Poverty_, after having\r\n    enumerated the privations and sufferings which fall to the lot of\r\n    the poor freeman, proceeds thus:--\"None of these evils belong to\r\n    slavery. The slave sleeps at his ease, being fed by the cares of\r\n    his master, and supplied with all the other things needful for his\r\n    body. But the poor freeman is constantly awake, seeking the means\r\n    of subsistence, and subjected to the severe dominion of want which\r\n    compels him to hunger.\" The well-informed author of _Haji Baba_\r\n    describes the astonishment of the vizier of the Shah of Persia, on\r\n    hearing from the British ambassador that there is no slavery in\r\n    England, and that the king is using his influence to put it down\r\n    in other States. \"Indeed!\" said the vizier, \"you surely cannot be\r\n    so cruel! What would become of the poor slaves if they were free?\r\n    Nothing can be happier than the lot of ours; but if they were\r\n    abandoned to their fate, they would starve and die. They are our\r\n    children, and form a part of our family.\"\r\n\r\n    A similar feeling is described by Mr. Kohl as existing among the\r\n    serfs in the Baltic provinces of Russia, with respect to their\r\n    recent emancipation. The serf is now no longer _abscriptus glebae_;\r\n    but it is not difficult for his lord to find the means of\r\n    detaining him on the estate if he wishes so to do. Mr. Kohl\r\n    continue thus:--\"Though the right which the peasant has thus\r\n    obtained is so frequently useless to him, the counter right of his\r\n    master, of banishing him from his native place, is very often\r\n    turned against him. Formerly, a noble could not, by any means, get\r\n    rid of his serfs; and, whenever they were in want, he was forced\r\n    to support and maintain them. At present, the moment a peasant\r\n    becomes useless and burdensome, it is easy to dismiss him; on\r\n    account of which the serfs, in some parts of the provinces, would\r\n    not accept of the emancipation offered, and bitterly lamented the\r\n    freedom, as it was called, which was forced upon them. The serf\r\n    often mournfully complains that he has lost a father and kept a\r\n    master, and his lord now often refuses the little requests of his\r\n    peasants, saying, 'You know you are not my children now.'\" A\r\n    similar state of feeling is likewise reported to exist among the\r\n    serfs of Russia Proper, who, in many cases, prefer the certainty\r\n    of slavery to the risks of emancipation. Mr. Featherstonhaugh, in\r\n    his _Travels_ in the Slave States of North America, relates that\r\n    Mr. Madison, the ex-President, informed him that he had once\r\n    assembled all his numerous slaves, and offered to manumit them\r\n    immediately; \"but they instantly declined it, alleging that they\r\n    had been born on his estate, had always been provided for by him\r\n    with raiment and food, in sickness and in health, and, if they\r\n    were made free, they would have no home to go to, and no friend to\r\n    protect and care for them. They preferred, therefore, to live and\r\n    die as his slaves, who had always been a kind master to them.\"\r\n\r\n    Slavery excludes the principle of competition, which reduces the\r\n    wages of the free laborer, increases his hours of work, and\r\n    sometimes deprives him of all means of subsistence. The\r\n    maintenance of slaves as one household, or _familia_, likewise\r\n    conduces to thrift; their supply on a large scale is, or ought to\r\n    be, less expensive than when each laborer, as in a state of\r\n    freedom, has a separate cottage and a family of his own. With\r\n    slaves thus supported, there is no more waste than with horses or\r\n    cattle. There is none of the loss or damage which arises from the\r\n    drunkenness and improvidence of the free laborer expending his own\r\n    wages. Again, the slave-master can regulate the number of his\r\n    workmen, and can in this manner control the amount of population.\r\n    The means may doubtless be harsh and cruel, but they are effective\r\n    for their end. In general, indeed, slave classes show a\r\n    disposition to diminish rather than increase in number; and,\r\n    where the slave trade has not been prohibited, the number is kept\r\n    up rather by new importation than by births. Hence the evils of an\r\n    abundant population never manifested themselves while the mass of\r\n    the people was in a servile and semi-servile state. Moreover, it\r\n    can scarcely be doubted, that under certain circumstances industry\r\n    may be promoted, and the produce of the land increased, by the\r\n    existence of a slave class. Mr. M'Culloch, indeed, thinks that the\r\n    tropical countries can never be effectually cultivated by free\r\n    labor. \"Were the slaves completely emancipated in the United\r\n    States, Cuba, and Brazil,\" says he, \"it is all but certain that\r\n    the culture of sugar and cotton would be as completely abandoned\r\n    in them as in Hayti. And if the change were accompanied by a\r\n    considerable improvement in the condition of the black population,\r\n    the sacrifice might not, perhaps, be deemed too great. But where\r\n    is the ground for supposing that such would be the case? Indeed,\r\n    the fair presumption seems to be the other way. Little, at all\r\n    events, would be gained by turning a laborious, well-fed slave,\r\n    into an idle, improvident, and perhaps beggarly freeman.\" If we\r\n    look merely to the present, and confine our views to _economical_\r\n    results, Mr. M'Culloch's arguments certainly appear strong. And\r\n    although it is true that all hope of _future_ improvement, in\r\n    respect of his physical condition, is denied to the slave, yet it\r\n    must be admitted, that practically, and looking to the actual\r\n    generation, the absence of a power of rising in the world is no\r\n    severe privation to a peasant class. Neither in England among the\r\n    agricultural laborers, nor in the Continental States among the\r\n    small proprietors, are there many instances of a person quitting\r\n    the condition in which he is born. Nor is any slavery so\r\n    indellible (where the slaves have the same colored skin as their\r\n    masters) as to prevent frequent emancipations of individual slaves\r\n    from personal affection and other causes. The freedmen formed a\r\n    numerous class among the Romans; and it is known to what important\r\n    posts slaves have risen in the Turkish empire.\r\n\r\n    After these remarks, (the intention of which cannot be\r\n    misunderstood by any reader of this Journal,) we can better\r\n    estimate the effects of the change from slavery to personal\r\n    freedom, upon the emancipated slave. He is relieved from the\r\n    liabilities and burdens, but he at the same time forfeits the\r\n    advantages of slavery. While the slave is exonerated from his\r\n    legal obligations to his master, the master is exonerated from his\r\n    legal and moral obligations towards his slave, and his interest in\r\n    the conservation and protection of his slave is at an end. The\r\n    slave (to use the common phrase) becomes his own master. With the\r\n    acquisition of this power, he incurs the obligations of\r\n    self-support. He becomes independent; and, being so, he must\r\n    provide for his self-defence. Self-dominion is not an unmixed good\r\n    to the work. It imports onerous duties. It implies the necessity\r\n    of providing for a man's own wants, and those of his family. The\r\n    freedman is no longer forced, by the fear of corporal punishment,\r\n    to do a prescribed task of work. But he must work in order to earn\r\n    wages; and, what is more, he must find work for himself. He is no\r\n    longer incapable of acquiring property, or of reaping the fruits\r\n    of his own industry. But he is, in consideration of this power,\r\n    bound to provide for his own support. He is no longer incapable of\r\n    contracting a lawful marriage, or begetting free legitimate\r\n    children. But he is bound to maintain his wife and children by his\r\n    own exertions; and if he deserts them, or allows them to starve,\r\n    he is subject to legal punishment. He is no longer fed and\r\n    maintained merely according to his physical wants, without\r\n    reference to the value of his services; but, on the other hand, he\r\n    is delivered over to the unchecked operation of the principle of\r\n    competition; and he must content himself with the scanty pittance\r\n    which the rivalry of the labor market may assign him. He is no\r\n    longer treated as a mere animal or implement of production,\r\n    without feeling, mind, or moral character; he does not follow the\r\n    religion of his master, and he may voluntarily choose his own\r\n    creed. But, in becoming a free moral agent, he accepts the\r\n    responsibilities of that condition; his path is open to virtue,\r\n    but he is answerable for his acts and their consequences if he\r\n    deviates into other ways; he can, by foresight, determine his own\r\n    lot, but he must, in compensation, suffer the penalties of his own\r\n    improvidence.\r\n\r\n    When we contemplate the actual results of the change in question,\r\n    and compare the state of the working classes in countries where\r\n    they are free, with the state of a slave class, we find that the\r\n    only benefits of freedom, which have been fully enjoyed by the\r\n    laboring classes, are the _negative_ ones, (such as exemption from\r\n    bodily inflictions, and other ill treatment;) but that the\r\n    _positive_ benefits which they have hitherto derived from the\r\n    social independence, have been less prominent. The _positive_\r\n    benefits--which are economical and domestic--which consist in the\r\n    acquisition, enjoyment and transmission of wealth, and in the\r\n    development of the family affections--are more remote, and depend\r\n    on numerous preliminary conditions which hitherto have rarely\r\n    co-existed in any community. The entire harvest of the change will\r\n    not be reaped until civilization has made further progress--until\r\n    the providence, industry, intelligence, and peaceableness of the\r\n    working man are such as to render him altogether fit for\r\n    self-support, and to protect society against the shocks arising\r\n    from his delusions and violence.\r\n\r\n    But, in proportion as the positive advantages are distant, the\r\n    disadvantages of the change make themselves sensibly felt. As soon\r\n    as slavery has ceased to exist, the freedom of action for the\r\n    working classes is complete; they are masters of their own\r\n    conduct, and their conduct determines the condition of the great\r\n    mass of the community. If, then, their moral state is low, and\r\n    they are exempt from all legal compulsion, they are likely to make\r\n    a bad use of their liberty. Whenever the moral restraints are\r\n    weak, and the rights of the freeman are exercised without\r\n    limitation, and with an inward consciousness of power, political\r\n    or social dangers cannot be far off. A slave-class, emancipated at\r\n    once, affords the strongest example of the evils arising under\r\n    this influence. Their moral condition is, at the best, like that\r\n    of children; they have had no experience of self-management; and\r\n    the rights of freedom are, from their novelty, prized most highly.\r\n    Some countries, however, from which slavery has long been\r\n    banished, exhibit a nearly similar state of things. Thus, in\r\n    Ireland, the freedom of the working classes has produced the\r\n    smallest amount of positive advantages, combined with the largest\r\n    amount of disadvantages. The peasantry are in the lowest physical\r\n    degradation; they derive the smallest possible quantum of\r\n    happiness from their power of disposing of themselves and their\r\n    families, and of acquiring property; while their rights of\r\n    citizenship are too frequently perverted to purposes detrimental\r\n    to themselves, and dangerous to the public peace.\r\n\r\n    When the slavery of the working classes had been gradually\r\n    extinguished in Western Europe, it began to be seen that the\r\n    theory of personal freedom could not be carried consistently into\r\n    practical effect for the entire community. A man might, in the eye\r\n    of the law, be presumed able and bound to maintain himself and his\r\n    family: but want of industry, or intelligence, or providence, or\r\n    the rapine of the strong, might reduce him to destitution and\r\n    helplessness. Accordingly, unless many of the laboring class were\r\n    to be permitted to die of hunger and neglect, it was necessary to\r\n    find some means of alleviating their sufferings.\r\n\r\nIn further reply to the Edinburgh Reviewer, and to illustrate by\r\nexamples our theory of \"Cannibals All; or, Slaves without Masters,\" read\r\nthe following from the North British Review for November, 1855, on the\r\nRural Population of England:\r\n\r\n    Have we not come upon a very paradise of rural seclusion? Is it\r\n    not a spot to be chosen by those who are intending to while away\r\n    existence among the never tiring sweets of a country life? But let\r\n    us step on a little way, and overtake the group of children that\r\n    is just now crossing the common. Alas! yet should we not refrain\r\n    from expressing the sad feelings which the first sight of these\r\n    infant shadows has awakened? feelings heightened by contrast; for\r\n    lately we were making our way through a fourth class street, where\r\n    the prime necessities of life are amply provided for. Besides, if\r\n    we look a second time at these shrunken forms--such is the\r\n    beneficence of the Creator--we see that childhood will have its\r\n    smiles, its laughs, its gambols, under conditions even the most\r\n    forlorn. Moreover, there is, notwithstanding that famished, watery\r\n    look--there is, taking the group altogether--there is an air of\r\n    pure rusticity--there is an innocence, comparatively, and a modest\r\n    propriety--there is a respectfulness in their style and deportment\r\n    which is greatly in their favor when thought of in comparison with\r\n    the bold, unreverential sauciness of the infant Hercules of\r\n    manufacturing towns.\r\n\r\n    But look at these unfortunates--the infant serfs of a neglected\r\n    rural district! Look at them physiologically--observe their lank,\r\n    colorless hair, screening the sunken eye, and trailing upon the\r\n    bony neck; look at the hollow cheeks, the candle-like arms, and\r\n    the unmuscular shanks which serve the young urchins for legs! But\r\n    are not these children breathing a pure atmosphere? Are they not\r\n    Nature's own? Yes; but there is one thing wanting to them--one\r\n    ominous word clears up the mystery. Starvation! Not, indeed, such\r\n    starvation as brings the sorrows of a sad lot to a speedy end; but\r\n    such as drags its pining sufferings out, through the overshadowed\r\n    years of childhood and youth; through those spasmodic years of\r\n    manhood during which the struggle to exist wears an aspect of\r\n    rugged rigor; and then through that residue of early decrepitude,\r\n    haggard, bent, idiot-like, which is indeed an unblessed end of an\r\n    unblessed existence. This rural population does pretty well if the\r\n    father be able-bodied and sober, and the mother managing, through\r\n    the summer season, of wheat-hoeing, hay-making, and wheat harvest;\r\n    that is to say, when the labor of the mother and her children\r\n    comes in to swell a little the weekly wages. During these weeks\r\n    something of needed clothing is obtained, rent is paid up, and a\r\n    pittance of animal food, weekly, is added to the bread, and the\r\n    tea, and the potato of the seven months' diet.\r\n\r\n    It would be doing a wrong to our worthy farmer friends, and to the\r\n    rural sporting gentry, to affirm that these miserables are\r\n    actually dying of want. No, they are not dying, so as inquests\r\n    must be held before they may be buried--would to God they\r\n    were--they are the living--they are living to show what\r\n    extremities men, women and children may endure, and yet not die;\r\n    or what they hold to be worse, not to betake themselves to \"the\r\n    union!\" But how do these same men, women and children pass five\r\n    months of the year? Gladly would one find them curled round like\r\n    hedgehogs, and hybernating in hollow trees; in rabbit burrows,\r\n    lost to consciousness. We should, indeed, count it a miracle if,\r\n    on a May morning, we were to see a group of human beings start up\r\n    alive from the sward, along with the paiglus and the cowslips. But\r\n    it is much less than a miracle to see the people of a depressed\r\n    rural district stepping alive out of the winter months!\r\n\r\n    The instances are extremely rare in which those who were born to\r\n    the soil, and destined to the plow, rise above their native level.\r\n    Such instances--two, three, or five--might be hunted up, if an\r\n    agricultural county were ransacked for the purpose; but the\r\n    agricultural laborer, even if he had the brain and the ambition\r\n    requisite, and if otherwise he could effect it, would seldom bring\r\n    with him that which the social mass, into which he might rise,\r\n    especially needs, namely, a fully developed and robust body.\r\n    Meantime, what is it that is taking place in hundreds of\r\n    instances, and every day, throughout the entire area of the\r\n    manufacturing region? Men, well put together, and with plenty of\r\n    bone, and nerve, and brain, using with an intense ardor those\r\n    opportunities of advancement which abound in these spheres of\r\n    enterprise and of prosperous achievement--such men are found to be\r\n    making themselves heard of among their betters, are seen\r\n    well-dressed before they reconcile themselves to the wearing of\r\n    gloves; by rapid advances they are winning for themselves a place\r\n    in society--a place which, indeed, they well deserve; and there\r\n    they are doing what they had not thought of--they are regenerating\r\n    the mass within which they have been received.\r\n\r\nWe extract the following from an article in the Edinburgh Review on\r\nJuvenile and Female Labor, in its January No., 1844. It is of the\r\nhighest authority, being part of a report of commissioners appointed by\r\nParliament, and stands endorsed as well by the action of Parliament as\r\nby the authority of the Reviewer:\r\n\r\nOur limits will not allow us to go through all the employments reported\r\nupon in these volumes; but, as specimens, we will give a short account\r\nof the condition of the people engaged in Coal mines, Calico-printing,\r\nMetal wares, Lace-making, and Millinery.\r\n\r\n_Coal Mines._--The number of children and young persons employed in\r\nthese mines is enormous; and they appear to commence working, even\r\nunderground, at an earlier age than is recorded of any other occupation\r\nexcept lace-making. The Commissioners report--\r\n\r\n    \"That instances occur in which children are taken into these mines\r\n    to work as early as _four_ years of age, sometimes at five, not\r\n    unfrequently between six and seven, and often from seven to eight,\r\n    while from eight to nine is the ordinary age at which their\r\n    employment commences.... That a very large proportion of the\r\n    persons employed in these mines is under thirteen years of age;\r\n    and a still larger proportion between thirteen and eighteen. That\r\n    in several districts female children begin to work in the mines as\r\n    early as males.\r\n\r\n    \"That the nature of the employment which is assigned to the\r\n    youngest children, generally that of 'trapping,' requires that\r\n    they should be in the pit as soon as the work of the day\r\n    commences, and, according to the present system, that they should\r\n    not leave the pit before the work of the day is at an end.\r\n\r\n    \"That although this employment scarcely deserves the name of\r\n    labor, yet, as the children engaged in it are commonly excluded\r\n    from light, and are always without companions, it would, were it\r\n    not for the passing and re-passing of the coal carriages, amount\r\n    to solitary confinement of the worst order.\r\n\r\n    \"That in some districts they remain in solitude and darkness\r\n    during the whole time they are in the pit, and, according to their\r\n    own account, many of them never see the light of day for weeks\r\n    together during the greater part of the winter season, excepting\r\n    on those days in the week when work is not going on, and on the\r\n    Sundays.\r\n\r\n    \"That at different ages, from six years old and upwards, the hard\r\n    work of pushing and dragging the carriages of coal from the\r\n    workings to the main ways or to the foot of the shaft, begins: a\r\n    labor which all classes of witnesses concur in stating, requires\r\n    the unremitting exertion of all the physical power which the young\r\n    workers possess.\r\n\r\n    \"That, in the districts in which females are taken down into the\r\n    coal mines, both sexes are employed together in precisely the same\r\n    kind of labor, and work for the same number of hours; that the\r\n    girls and boys, and the young men and the young women, and even\r\n    married women and women with child, commonly work almost naked,\r\n    and the men, in many mines, quite naked; and that all classes of\r\n    witnesses bear testimony to the demoralizing influence of the\r\n    employment of females underground.[32]\r\n\r\n    \"That, in the east of Scotland, a much larger proportion of\r\n    children and young persons are employed in these mines than in\r\n    other districts, many of whom are girls; and that the chief part\r\n    of their labor consists in carrying the coals on their backs up\r\n    steep ladders.\r\n\r\n    \"That when the work-people are in full employment, the regular\r\n    hours of work for children and young persons are rarely less than\r\n    eleven; more often they are _twelve_; in some districts they are\r\n    _thirteen_; and in one district they are generally _fourteen_ and\r\n    upwards.\r\n\r\n    \"That, in the great majority of these mines night-work is a part\r\n    of the ordinary system of labor, more or less regularly carried on\r\n    according to the demand for coals, and one which the whole body\r\n    of evidence shows to act most injuriously both on the physical and\r\n    moral condition of the work-people, and more especially on that of\r\n    the children and young persons.\r\n\r\n    \"That in many cases the children and young persons have little\r\n    cause of complaint in regard to the treatment they receive, while\r\n    in many mines the conduct of the adult colliers to them is harsh\r\n    and cruel; the persons in authority who must be cognizant of this\r\n    ill usage never interfering to prevent it, and some of them\r\n    distinctly stating that they do not conceive they have a right to\r\n    do so. That with some exceptions little interest is taken by the\r\n    coal-owners in the children employed in their works after the\r\n    daily labor is over.... That in all the coalfields accidents of a\r\n    fearful nature are extremely frequent, and of the work-people who\r\n    perish by such accidents, the proportion of children and young\r\n    persons sometimes equals, and rarely falls much below that of\r\n    adults.\"--(First Report, p. 255-7.)\r\n\r\nWith respect to the general healthiness of the employment, there is\r\nconsiderable discrepancy in the evidence adduced; many witnesses stating\r\nthat the colliers generally, especially the adults, are a remarkably\r\nhealthy race, showing a very small average of sickness,[33] and\r\nrecovering with unusual rapidity from the severest accidents;--a\r\npeculiarity which the medical men reasonably enough attribute to the\r\nuniform temperature of the mines, and still more to the abundance of\r\nnutritious food which the high wages of the work-people enable them to\r\nprocure. The great majority of the witnesses, however, give a very\r\ndifferent impression. Upwards of two hundred, whose testimony is quoted,\r\nor referred to in the Report of the Central Commissioners, testify to\r\nthe extreme fatigue of the children when they return home at night, and\r\nto the injurious effect which this ultimately produces on their\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nWhile the effect of such early and severe labor is, to cause a peculiar\r\nand extraordinary degree of muscular development in collier children, it\r\nalso stunts their growth, and produces a proportionate diminution of\r\nstature, as is shown by the following comparison.--(Physical and Moral\r\nCondition of Children, p. 55.)\r\n\r\n  10 Farmers' boys, between 12\r\n      and 14 years, measured, each, 56.4 inches in height.\r\n  10 Colliers' boys,                53.4    \"        \"\r\n                                    ----\r\n                Difference,          3.     \"        \"\r\n\r\n  10 Farmers' girls, between 14\r\n      and 17 years, measured, each, 60.5 inches in height.\r\n  10 Colliers' girls,               55.6    \"        \"\r\n                                    ----\r\n                Difference,          4.9    \"        \"\r\n\r\n  51 Farmers' children, 10 years\r\n      old, measured, each,          51.     \"        \"\r\n  60 Colliers' children,            48.     \"        \"\r\n                                    ----\r\n                Difference,          3.     \"        \"\r\n\r\n  49 Farmers' children, 15-1/2 years\r\n      old, measured, each,          59.     \"        \"\r\n  50 Colliers' children,            53.     \"        \"\r\n                                    ----\r\n                Difference,          6.     \"        \"[34]\r\n\r\nLabor in coal mines is also stated, by a great number of most\r\nrespectable witnesses, to produce a crippled gait, and a curvature of\r\nthe spinal column, as well as a variety of disorders--among which may be\r\nenumerated, affections of the heart, rupture, asthma, rheumatism, and\r\nloss of appetite;--and this not merely in a few cases, but as an\r\nhabitual, and almost inevitable result of their occupation.\r\n\r\n    \"Of the effect of employment in the coal mines of the East of\r\n    Scotland in producing an early and irreparable deterioration of\r\n    the physical condition, the Sub-commissioner thus reports:--'In a\r\n    state of society, such as has been described, the condition of the\r\n    children may be easily imagined, and its baneful influence on the\r\n    health cannot well be exaggerated; and I am informed by very\r\n    competent authorities, that six months' labor in the mines is\r\n    sufficient to effect a very visible change in the physical\r\n    condition of the children: and indeed it is scarcely possible to\r\n    conceive of circumstances more calculated to sow the seeds of\r\n    future disease, and, to borrow the language of the instructions,\r\n    to prevent the organs from being developed, to enfeeble and\r\n    disorder their functions, and to subject the whole system to\r\n    injury, which cannot be repaired at any subsequent stage of\r\n    life.'---(Frank's Report, s. 68: App. Pt. I, p. 396.) In the West\r\n    of Scotland, Dr. Thomson, Ayr, says:--'A collier at fifty\r\n    generally has the appearance of a man ten years older than he\r\n    is.'\"--(Evidence, No. 34; App. Pt. I, p. 371, l. 58.)\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the testimony as to the moral, intellectual, and spiritual\r\nstate of the great mass of the collier population, the picture is even\r\ndarker and more appalling than that which has been drawn of their\r\nphysical condition. The means of instruction to which they have access\r\nare scanty in the extreme;--their readiness to avail themselves of such\r\nmeans, if possible still scantier; and the real results of the\r\ninstruction they do obtain, scantiest of all--as the following extracts\r\nwill show:--\r\n\r\n    \"As an example of the mental culture of the collier children in\r\n    the neighborhood of Halifax, the Sub-commissioner states, that an\r\n    examination of 219 children and young persons at the bottom of one\r\n    of the coal-pits, he found only 31 that could read an easy book,\r\n    not more than 15 that could write their names, these latter having\r\n    received instruction at some day-school before they commenced\r\n    colliery labor, and that the whole of the remaining number were\r\n    incapable of connecting two syllables together.\"--(Scriven,\r\n    Report, Mines: App. Pt. II, 73, s. 91.)\r\n\r\n    \"Of the state of education in the coalfields of Lancashire, the\r\n    Sub-commissioner gives the following account:--'It was my\r\n    intention to have laid before the Central Board evidence of the\r\n    effects of education, as shown by the comparative value of\r\n    educated and uneducated colliers and children employed in coal\r\n    mines, as workmen, and to have traced its effects, as shown by the\r\n    superior moral habits and generally more exalted condition of\r\n    those who had received the benefits of education over those who\r\n    had not, which I had observed and proved to exist in other\r\n    branches of industry. I found, however that the case was hopeless;\r\n    there were so few, either of colliers or their children, who had\r\n    even received the first rudiments of education, that it was\r\n    impossible to institute a comparison.'--(Kennedy, Report, Mines:\r\n    App. Pt. II, p. 183, s. 268.)\r\n\r\n    \"In the coalfields of North Lancashire examined by Mr. Austin, it\r\n    is stated that the education of the working-people has been almost\r\n    wholly neglected; that they have received scarcely any instruction\r\n    at all, either religious or secular; that they cannot therefore be\r\n    supposed to have any correct conception of their moral duties, and\r\n    that in fact their intellects are as little enlightened as their\r\n    places of work--'darkness reigns throughout.'--(Report, Mines:\r\n    App. Pt. II, p. 805, s. 26.)\r\n\r\n    \"In the East of Scotland a marked inferiority in the collier\r\n    children to those of the town and manufacturing population.\r\n    Upwards of 100 heads of collier families, most of whom leave their\r\n    children to themselves--to ignorance and irreligion.\"--(_Ibid._\r\n    p. 426, l. 42.) 'Many of the children are not educated at\r\n    all.'\"--(_Ibid._ p. 428, l. 30.)\r\n\r\nIt appears that, in the principal mining districts, few of the colliers\r\nattend any place of worship; and of their entire ignorance of the most\r\nelementary truths, either of secular or religious knowledge, the\r\nfollowing extracts will give some idea:--\r\n\r\n    \"YORKSHIRE.--With respect even to the common truths of\r\n    Christianity and facts of Scripture,' says Mr. Symons, 'I am\r\n    confident that a majority are in a state of heathen ignorance. I\r\n    unhesitatingly affirm that the mining children, as a body, are\r\n    growing up in a state of absolute and appalling ignorance; and I\r\n    am sure that the evidence I herewith transmit, alike from all\r\n    classes--clergymen, magistrates, masters, men, and children--will\r\n    fully substantiate and justify the strength of the expressions\r\n    which I have alone felt to be adequate to characterize the mental\r\n    condition of this benighted community.'\r\n\r\n    \"'Throughout the whole district of the coal-field,' says Mr.\r\n    Scriven, 'the youthful population is in a state of profaneness,\r\n    and almost of mental imbecility.'\r\n\r\n    \"'The ignorance and the degraded state of the colliers and their\r\n    children,' says Mr. Kennedy, 'are proverbial throughout this\r\n    district. They are uneducated, ignorant, and brutal; deteriorated\r\n    as workmen and dangerous as subjects.'\"\r\n\r\nBut nothing can show their mental state in so striking a manner, as the\r\nevidence derived from the examination of the children themselves, by the\r\nSub-commissioner:--\r\n\r\n    \"'A girl eighteen years old--I never learnt nought. I never go to\r\n    church or chapel. I have never heard that a good man came into the\r\n    world, who was God's Son, to save sinners. I never heard of Christ\r\n    at all. Nobody has ever told me about him, nor have my father and\r\n    mother ever taught me to pray. I know no prayer: I never pray. I\r\n    have been taught nothing about such things.'--(Evidence, Mines, p.\r\n    252, 11, 35, 39.) 'The Lord sent Adam and Eve on earth to save\r\n    sinners.'--(_Ibid._ p. 245, l. 66.) 'I don't know who made the\r\n    world; I never heard about God.'--(_Ibid._ p. 228, l. 17.) 'Jesus\r\n    Christ was a shepherd; he came a hundred years ago to receive sin.\r\n    I don't know who the Apostles were.'--(_Ibid._ p. 232, l. 11.)\r\n    'Jesus Christ was born in heaven, but I don't know what happened\r\n    to him; he came on earth to commit sin. Yes; to commit sin.\r\n    Scotland is a country, but I don't know where it is. I never heard\r\n    of France.'--(_Ibid._ p. 265, l. 17.) 'I don't know who Jesus\r\n    Christ was; I never saw him, but I've seen Foster, who prays about\r\n    him.'--(_Ibid._ p. 291, l. 63.) 'I have been three years at a\r\n    Sunday-school. I don't know who the Apostles were. Jesus Christ\r\n    died for his son to be saved.'--(_Ibid._ 245, l. 10.) Employer (to\r\n    the Commissioner,) 'You have expressed surprise at Thomas Mitchell\r\n    (the preceding witness) not having heard of God. I judge there are\r\n    few colliers hereabouts that have.'\"--(Second Report, p. 156.)\r\n\r\nThe moral state of the collier population is represented by the\r\nSub-commissioners as deplorable in the extreme:--\r\n\r\n    \"LANCASHIRE.--'All that I have seen myself,' says the\r\n    Sub-commissioner, 'tends to the same conclusion as the preceding\r\n    evidence; namely, that the moral condition of the colliers and\r\n    their children in this district, is decidedly amongst the lowest\r\n    of any portion of the working-classes.'--(_Ibid._ Report, s. 278,\r\n    _et seq._)\r\n\r\n    \"DURHAM and NORTHUMBERLAND.--The religious and moral condition of\r\n    the children, and more particularly of the young persons employed\r\n    in the collieries of North Durham and Northumberland, is stated\r\n    by clergymen and others, witnesses, to be 'deplorable.' 'Their\r\n    morals,' they say, 'are bad, their education worse, their\r\n    intellect very much debased, and their carelessness, irreligion,\r\n    and immorality' exceeding any thing to be found in an agricultural\r\n    district.\"--(Leifchild, Report, Mines: Evidence, Nos. 795, 530,\r\n    500, 493, 668.)\r\n\r\n_Calico-Printing._--This employs a vast number of children of both\r\nsexes, who have to mix and grind the colors for the adult work-people,\r\nand are commonly called _teerers_. They begin to work, according to the\r\nReport, sometimes before five years of age, often between five and six,\r\nand generally before nine. The usual hours of labor are twelve,\r\nincluding meal-time; but as the children generally work the same time as\r\nthe adults, \"it is by no means uncommon in all the districts for\r\n_children of five or six years old to be kept at work fourteen and even\r\nsixteen hours consecutively_.\"--(Second Report, p. 59.) In many\r\ninstances, however, it will be seen that even these hours are shamefully\r\nexceeded, during a press of work.\r\n\r\n    \"352. Thomas Sidbread, block-printer, after taking a child who had\r\n    already been at work all day to assist him as a teerer through the\r\n    night, says--'We began to work between eight and nine o'clock on\r\n    the Wednesday night; but the boy had been sweeping the shop from\r\n    Wednesday morning. You will scarcely believe it, but it is true--I\r\n    never left the shop till six o'clock on the Saturday morning; and\r\n    I had never stopped working all that time, excepting for an hour\r\n    or two, and that boy with me all the time. I was knocked up, and\r\n    the boy was almost insensible.'\r\n\r\n    \"353. Henry Richardson, block-printer, states--'At four o'clock I\r\n    began to work, and worked all that day, all the next night, and\r\n    until ten the following day. I had only one teerer dining that\r\n    time, and I dare say he would be about twelve years old. I had to\r\n    shout to him towards the second night, as he got sleepy. I had one\r\n    of my own children, about ten years old, who was a teerer. He\r\n    worked with me at Messrs. Wilson & Crichton's, at Blakely. We\r\n    began to work together about two or three in the morning, and left\r\n    off at four or five in the afternoon.'\r\n\r\nNight-work, too, with all its evil consequences, is very common in this\r\ntrade;--and of the general state of education among the block-printers\r\nin Lancashire, the Commissioners thus speak, (p. 172.)\r\n\r\n    \"The evidence collected by Mr. Kennedy in the Lancashire district,\r\n    tends to show that the children employed in this occupation are\r\n    excluded from the opportunities of education; that this\r\n    necessarily contributes to the growth of an ignorant and vicious\r\n    population; that the facility of obtaining early employment for\r\n    children in print-fields empties the day-schools; that parents\r\n    without hesitation sacrifice the future welfare of their children\r\n    through life for the immediate advantage or gratification obtained\r\n    by the additional pittance derived from the child's earnings, and\r\n    that they imagine, or pretend, that they do not neglect their\r\n    children's education if they send them to Sunday-schools.\"\r\n\r\n_Metal Wares._--The chief seats of manufactures in metal are Birmingham,\r\nWolverhampton, and Sheffield; but many of the minor branches are carried\r\non in different parts of Scotland, and in Worcestershire and Lancashire.\r\nIn the various departments of this species of manufacture many thousands\r\nof children of both sexes are employed. They begin to work generally\r\nabout their _eighth_ year, as in Birmingham and Sheffield, but often\r\nearlier; while in _pin-making_, as carried on at Warrington, both boys\r\nand girls commence when _five_ years old, and work _twelve hours_ a-day,\r\nand sometimes, though rarely, even more. The hours of work in most of\r\nthe metal manufactures are very irregular, generally from ten to\r\nthirteen a-day; but, especially in the neighborhood of Wolverhampton, it\r\nis by no means unfrequent to extend them to fifteen or sixteen for weeks\r\ntogether. The places in which the occupations are carried on are\r\noccasionally large, clean, and well ventilated; but in the great\r\nmajority of cases, a very different description of them is given.\r\n\r\n    \"In general the buildings are very old, and many of them are in a\r\n    dilapidated, ruinous, and even dangerous condition. Nothing is\r\n    more common than to find many of the windows broken; in some cases\r\n    I observed more broken than whole panes; great and just complaint\r\n    is made upon this point by those employed. The shops are often\r\n    dark and narrow; many of them, especially those used for stamping,\r\n    are from four to seven feet below the level of the ground; these\r\n    latter, which are cold and damp, are justly complained of by the\r\n    workers. From defective construction all these old shops are\r\n    liable to become 'sufficatingly hot in summer (and also at night\r\n    when the gas is lighted) and very cold in winter. Efficient\r\n    ventilation is a thing unknown in these places. The great majority\r\n    of the shops are never whitewashed, but there are many creditable\r\n    exceptions to this statement.'\r\n\r\n    \"It has been already stated, that although the whole population of\r\n    the town of Wolverhampton and the neighborhood, of all ranks, are\r\n    engaged in the different manufactures of the place, yet that there\r\n    are few manufactories of large size, the work being commonly\r\n    carried on in small workshops. Those workshops are usually\r\n    situated at the backs of the houses, there being very few in the\r\n    front of a street; so that the places where the children and the\r\n    great body of the operatives are employed are completely out of\r\n    sight, in narrow courts, unpaved yards, and blind alleys. In the\r\n    smaller and dirtier streets of the town, in which the poorest of\r\n    the working classes reside, 'there are narrow passages, at\r\n    intervals of every eight or ten houses, and sometimes at every\r\n    third or fourth house. These narrow passages are also the general\r\n    gutter, which is by no means always confined to one side, but\r\n    often streaming all over the passage. Having made your way through\r\n    the passage, you find yourself in a space varying in size with the\r\n    number of houses, hutches, or hovels it contains. They are nearly\r\n    all proportionately crowded. Out of this space there are other\r\n    narrow passages, sometimes leading to other similar hovels. The\r\n    workshops and houses are mostly built on a little elevation\r\n    sloping towards the passage.'\"--(Second Report, p. 33.)\r\n\r\nThe most painful portions, however, of the Report on the metal\r\nmanufactures, are those which relate to the treatment of the children\r\nand apprentices at Willenhall, near Wolverhampton, and to the noxious\r\ninfluences of those departments which are carried on at Sheffield.--(P.\r\n83.)\r\n\r\n    \"455. The district which requires special notice on account of the\r\n    general and almost incredible abuse of the children, is that of\r\n    Wolverhampton and the neighborhood. In the town of Wolverhampton\r\n    itself, among the large masters children are not punished with\r\n    severity, and in some of the trades, as among the japanners, they\r\n    are not beaten at all; but, on the other hand, in the nail and tip\r\n    manufactories, in some of the founderies, and among the very\r\n    numerous class of small masters generally, the punishments are\r\n    harsh and cruel; and in some cases they can only be designated as\r\n    ferocious.\r\n\r\n    \"456. In Willenhall the children are shamefully and most cruelly\r\n    beaten with a horsewhip, strap, stick, hammer handle, file, or\r\n    whatever tool is nearest at hand, or are struck with the clenched\r\n    fist or kicked.\r\n\r\n    \"457. In Sedgley they are sometimes struck with a red-hot iron,\r\n    and burnt and bruised simultaneously; sometimes they have 'a flash\r\n    of lightning' sent at them. 'When a bar of iron is drawn white-hot\r\n    from the forge it emits fiery particles, which the man commonly\r\n    flings in a shower upon the ground by a swing of his arm before\r\n    placing the bar upon the anvil. This shower is sometimes directed\r\n    at the boy. It may come over his hands and face, his naked arms,\r\n    or on his breast. If his shirt be open in front, which is usually\r\n    the case, the red-hot particles are lodged therein, and he has to\r\n    shake them out as fast as he can.' ... 'His master's name is ----,\r\n    of Little London. There is another apprentice besides him, who is\r\n    treated just as bad.' ----, aged fifteen, 'works at Knoblocks with\r\n    ----. Is a fellow-apprentice with ----. Lives in the house of his\r\n    master. Is beaten by his master, who hits him sometimes with his\r\n    fists, and sometimes with the file haft, and sometimes with a\r\n    stick--it's no matter what when he's a bit cross; sometimes hits\r\n    him with the locks; has cut his head open four or five times; so\r\n    he has his fellow-apprentice's head.'\r\n\r\n    \"466. The Rev. Isaac Clarkson, magistrate, vicar of Wednesbury.\r\n    'In his capacity of magistrate complaints often come before him,\r\n    made by boys against masters, from different places round about,\r\n    such as Willenhall and Darlaston, but he did not encourage them,\r\n    as they should more properly apply to the magistrates of\r\n    Wolverhampton. More complaints came before him from the mines than\r\n    from the manufactories; but sometimes there was very bad usage in\r\n    the latter. A boy from Darlaston has recently been beaten most\r\n    unmercifully with a red-hot piece of iron. The boy was\r\n    burnt--fairly burnt. Wished to cancel the indentures; but the\r\n    master had been to the board of guardians, or to the clerk of the\r\n    Stafford union, and promised to behave better in future. Has had\r\n    various similar cases brought before him.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following statements of the Commissioners demand serious\r\nconsideration.--(Second Report, p. 105.)\r\n\r\n    \"581. But the chief disease is that produced by the occupation of\r\n    the grinder, which is the most pernicious of any branch of\r\n    manufacture in England. The inhalation of the dust of the\r\n    grindstone and of the steel of the knife, or whatever he may be\r\n    grinding, is so pernicious, that the life of a dry grinder\r\n    scarcely averages thirty-five years, whilst that of a wet grinder\r\n    is seldom prolonged to more than forty-five years. The bent\r\n    posture and pressure on the stomach aggravate the evil.\r\n    Fork-grinding is the most pernicious, because it is done dry, and\r\n    a great deal more of the steel has to be ground off. Dr. Knight\r\n    states that he cannot better express how injurious grinding is to\r\n    the health than by stating, that 'they who are the greatest\r\n    drinkers among the grinders are sometimes the longest lived, owing\r\n    to their more frequent absence from their work.'\r\n\r\n    \"582. Dust flues, in the state of perfection to which they have\r\n    now been brought, appear to be capable of greatly diminishing if\r\n    not of entirely obviating the evil. The Sheffield grinders cannot,\r\n    however, be induced to avail themselves of this security; they\r\n    know that they are doomed to an early death, yet they are\r\n    absolutely unwilling that the evil to which they are exposed\r\n    should in any degree be lessened: they regard every precaution to\r\n    prolong life with jealousy, as a means of increasing the supply of\r\n    labor and lowering wages; they are for 'a short life and a merry\r\n    one,' and hence, even when the masters are at the expense of\r\n    erecting the apparatus, these men refuse to use it, and even\r\n    frequently kick it down and break it under their feet.'\"--(_Ibid._\r\n    Evidence.)\r\n\r\nAs to the moral state of this class of work-people, the Report speaks\r\nthus.--(Second Report, p. 176-178.)\r\n\r\n    \"933. The moral and religious state of the children and young\r\n    persons employed in the trades and manufactures of Birmingham, is\r\n    described by the Sub-commissioner as very unfavorable. The social\r\n    and domestic duties and affections are but little cultivated and\r\n    practiced; great numbers never attend any place of religious\r\n    worship; and of the state of juvenile crime some conception may be\r\n    formed from the statement, that of the total number of known or\r\n    suspected offenders in this town, during the last twelve months,\r\n    namely 1223, at least one-half were under fifteen years of age.\r\n\r\n    \"934. As to illicit sexual intercourse, it seems to prevail almost\r\n    universally, and from a very early period of life: to this\r\n    conclusion witnesses of every rank give testimony.\r\n\r\n    \"936. WOLVERHAMPTON.--Of the moral condition of the youthful\r\n    population in the Wolverhampton district, Mr. Horne says--'Putting\r\n    together all I elicited from various witnesses and conversations\r\n    with working people, abroad and at home, and all that fell under\r\n    my observation, I am obliged to come to the conclusion, that the\r\n    moral virtues of the great majority of the children are as few in\r\n    number and as feeble in practice as can well be conceived of those\r\n    who are born in a civilized country, surrounded by religious and\r\n    educational institutions, and by individuals anxious for the\r\n    improvement of the condition of the working classes.' He adds of\r\n    Willenhall--'A lower condition of morals, in the fullest sense of\r\n    the term, could not, I think, be found. I do not mean by this that\r\n    there are many more prominent vices among them, but that moral\r\n    feelings and sentiments do not exist among them. They have no\r\n    morals.'\r\n\r\n    \"940. SHEFFIELD.--In all the Sheffield trades employing large\r\n    numbers of children, it is stated that there is a much closer\r\n    intermixture of the younger children with the elder youths, and\r\n    with the men, than is usual in the cotton, woollen, and flax\r\n    factories; and that the conversations to which the children are\r\n    compelled to listen, would debase their minds and blunt their\r\n    moral feelings even if they had been carefully and virtuously\r\n    educated, but that of course this result takes place more rapidly\r\n    and completely in the case of those who have had little or no\r\n    religious culture, and little but bad example before their eyes\r\n    from their cradle upwards.\r\n\r\n    \"943. Habits of drinking are formed at a very early age, malt\r\n    liquor being generally introduced into the workshops, of which the\r\n    youngest children are encouraged to partake. 'Very many,' say the\r\n    police officers, 'frequent beer-shops, where they play at\r\n    dominoes, bagatelle, &c., for money or drink.' Early intemperance\r\n    is assigned by the medical men as one cause of the great mortality\r\n    of Sheffield. 'There are beer-houses,' says the Rev. Mr. Farish,\r\n    'attended by youths exclusively, for the men will not have them in\r\n    the same houses with themselves. In these beer-houses the youth\r\n    of both sexes are encouraged to meet, and scenes destructive of\r\n    every vestige of virtue or morality ensue.'\r\n\r\n    \"945. But it is stated by all classes of witnesses, that 'the most\r\n    revolting feature of juvenile depravity in this town is early\r\n    contamination from the association of the sexes;' that 'juvenile\r\n    prostitution is exceedingly common.' 'The evidence,' says the\r\n    Sub-commissioner, 'might have been doubled which attests the early\r\n    commencement of sexual and promiscuous intercourse among boys and\r\n    girls.'\r\n\r\n    \"953. SEDGLEY.--At Sedgley and the neighboring villages, the\r\n    number of girls employed in nail-making considerably exceeds that\r\n    of the boys. Of these girls Mr. Horne reports--'Their appearance,\r\n    manners, habits, and moral natures, (so far as the word _moral_\r\n    can be applied to them,) are in accordance with their\r\n    half-civilized condition. Constantly associating with ignorant and\r\n    depraved adults and young persons of the opposite sex, they\r\n    naturally fall into all their ways; and drink, smoke, swear, throw\r\n    off all restraint in word and act, and become as bad as a man. The\r\n    heat of the forge and the hardness of the work render few clothes\r\n    needful in winter; and in summer, the six or seven individuals who\r\n    are crowded into these little dens find the heat almost\r\n    suffocating. The men and boys are usually naked, except a pair of\r\n    trousers and an open shirt, though very often they have no shirt;\r\n    and the women and girls have only a thin, ragged petticoat, and an\r\n    open shirt without sleeves.'\"\r\n\r\n_Lace-Making._--In this occupation it is proved, by unquestionable\r\nevidence, that it is _customary_ for children to begin to work at the\r\nage of four, five, and six years; and instances were found in which a\r\nchild only _two_ years old was set to work by the side of its mother.\r\nThe work is of course very slight, but is trying to the eyes. The\r\nSub-commissioner, after detailing a case, says:--\r\n\r\n    \"58. In this case, if the statement of the mother be correct, one\r\n    of her children, four years of age, works twelve hours a-day with\r\n    only an interval of a quarter of an hour for each meal, at\r\n    breakfast, dinner, and tea, and never going out to play: and two\r\n    more of her children, one six and the other eight years of age,\r\n    work in summer from 6 a. m. till dusk, and in winter from seven in\r\n    the morning till ten at night, fifteen hours.\r\n\r\n    \"59. This family is singular only in the children being set to\r\n    work at the ages of two or three. It is common in this district\r\n    for children to commence work at four, five, and six; the evidence\r\n    renders this fact indubitable.\"--(Second Report, p. 10.)\r\n\r\nThe following extracts relate to the hours of work in the lace trade:--\r\n\r\n    \"336. In the Nottingham, Leicester, and Derby districts, partly\r\n    from the causes just assigned, and partly from the dissipated\r\n    habits of the workmen, 'the hours of labor are so extremely\r\n    irregular that it is impossible to speak of them with exact\r\n    precision.' The hand-machines, especially the wide machines, are\r\n    usually double-handed; some very large ones have three men each;\r\n    the men work such machines by 'spells for shifts.' The most common\r\n    time is sixteen, eighteen, and occasionally twenty hours. 'However\r\n    long,' adds the Sub-commissioner, 'may be the hours during which\r\n    the machines are propelled, even for the whole twenty-four, either\r\n    by hand or power, there are scarcely ever two complete sets of\r\n    threaders.'\r\n\r\n    \"341. Mr. William Hinde, aged twenty-nine, operative--'Among the\r\n    small masters, who have each one or two machines, it is the custom\r\n    for one set of children to work for two or three masters. The\r\n    masters often live a long way from each other; children have often\r\n    to go one or two miles. They are always wanted when the machine\r\n    comes off, whatever may be the hour of the day or night; they are\r\n    required just as much by night as by day, unless the men will\r\n    accommodate the children, which is very rarely done, especially\r\n    when trade is good. When there has been a good pattern, and the\r\n    machine in constant use, the children \"have scarcely a bit of\r\n    peace,\" they have no regular time for meals, \"no time for\r\n    nothing;\" when one machine is off, another is on. Was himself\r\n    formerly a threader, and then a winder. Has often gone at six in\r\n    the morning, and has had no time to get any thing to eat, except a\r\n    mouthful now and then, till three or four in the afternoon. It is\r\n    the same now, when trade is good. The children have no regular\r\n    time for meals; they have their food sent to them, and they eat\r\n    when they can; some have nothing but a bit of bread. There is no\r\n    more regular time for sleeping than for eating; the children often\r\n    lie down \"in the middle of the shop door, when it is warm.\" Thinks\r\n    hundreds have been sent to the grave by this work. It is enough to\r\n    kill the children, going half fed and clothed to work in the\r\n    night, at this time of the year. (The thermometer last night was\r\n    102.')--(Second Report, pp. 56-9).\r\n\r\nOf course, work of this nature, for such hours, and at such an early\r\nage, cannot but be followed by deplorable consequences to health in\r\nafter life, as well as to moral character. Accordingly the Commissioners\r\nreport.--(II, p. 109, 110, 181.)\r\n\r\n    \"598. From the nature of their occupation, the long and irregular\r\n    hours of work, the frequency of night-work, and the insufficient\r\n    time allowed for meals--an evil of the greatest magnitude in the\r\n    case of growing children--the constitution is frequently seriously\r\n    impaired. 'The majority of the children whom I saw,' says the\r\n    Sub-commissioner, 'were pale and unhealthy-looking, and several\r\n    were of diminutive stature. The health and sight are often greatly\r\n    impaired, especially among the runners, who occasionally faint\r\n    while at work; indeed, there cannot be an occupation which more\r\n    seriously deteriorates the constitution. Short-sightedness,\r\n    amaurosis, distortion of the spine, excessive constitutional\r\n    debility, indigestion, and derangement of the uterine functions,\r\n    may be said to be almost universal: all the evidence points to\r\n    this conclusion.'\r\n\r\n    \"'In the town of Nottingham,' says Mr. Grainger, 'all parties,\r\n    clergy, police, manufacturers, work-people, and parents, agree\r\n    that the present mode of employing children and young persons as\r\n    threaders and winders is a most fertile source of immorality.\r\n    There can, in fact, be but few states more immediately leading to\r\n    vice and profligacy. Children of both sexes are called out of\r\n    their parents' houses at all hours of the night, and, as it is\r\n    quite uncertain how long they may be required, whether for two\r\n    hours or the whole night, a ready and unanswerable excuse for\r\n    staying out is furnished.--(No. 138.)\r\n\r\n    \"The moral condition of the lace-makers in Northamptonshire,\r\n    Oxfordshire, Beds and Bucks, is stated by Major Burns to be\r\n    extremely low, and prostitution is rife among them, from their\r\n    scanty earnings, their love of finery, and the almost total\r\n    absence of early moral culture.\"--(Report: App. Pt. I, p. A. 12,\r\n    s. 104.)\r\n\r\n_Millinery and Dressmaking._--The portion of these instructive volumes\r\nwhich describes the condition of the young women employed as milliners\r\nand mantua-makers in our great cities, and especially in London, is,\r\nhowever, that which has left the most painful impression upon our\r\nminds--not only because the work of these unfortunate girls is of all\r\nthe most, severe and unremitting--nor because it is inflicted\r\nexclusively upon the weaker sex, and at a period of life the most\r\nsusceptible of injury from overstrained exertion--nor yet because the\r\nactual consequences which are shown to ensue in thousands of cases are\r\nso peculiarly deplorable---but because the excess of labor (with all\r\nits pernicious and fatal results) is endured in the service, and\r\ninflicted in execution of the orders, of a class whose own exemption\r\nfrom toil and privation should make them scrupulously careful not to\r\nincrease, causelessly or selfishly, the toils and privations of their\r\nless favored fellow-creatures--a class, too, many of whom have been\r\nconspicuously loud in denouncing the cruelties of far more venial\r\noffenders, and in expressing a somewhat clamorous and overacted sympathy\r\nwith sufferings which cannot for a moment be compared in severity with\r\nthose which are every day inflicted on the helpless of their own sex, in\r\nministering to their own factitious and capricious wants. The remark may\r\nappear harsh, but the evidence before us fully warrants it--that\r\nprobably in no occupation whatever--not in the printing fields of\r\nLancashire--not, in the lace trade of Nottingham--not in the collieries\r\nof Scotland--scarcely in the workshops of Willenhall--most assuredly not\r\nin the cotton factories of Manchester, (which a few years ago the\r\nfashionable fair of London were so pathetic in lamenting)--can any\r\ninstances of cruelty be met with which do not \"whiten in the shade\" of\r\nthose which every spring and autumn season sees practiced--unreprobated,\r\nand till now nearly unknown--in the _millinery establishments_ of the\r\nmetropolis.\r\n\r\nThe following extracts will show that we are guilty of no\r\nexaggeration.--(II, p. 114-122.)\r\n\r\n    \"622. It is estimated that there are in London, in the millinery\r\n    and dressmaking business, at least 1500 employers, and that the\r\n    number of young people engaged by each employer varies from two or\r\n    three to twenty-five or thirty-five--the average in each\r\n    establishment being about ten, making in the whole 15,000; but\r\n    this does not include journeywomen who work at their own houses,\r\n    of whom also there are great numbers.\r\n\r\n    \"623. In some of what are considered the best regulated\r\n    establishments, during the fashionable season, occupying about\r\n    four months in the year, the regular hours of work are fifteen,\r\n    but on emergencies, which frequently recur, these hours extend to\r\n    eighteen. In many establishments the hours of work, during the\r\n    season, are unlimited, the young women never getting more than\r\n    six, often not more than four, sometimes only three, and\r\n    occasionally not more than two hours for rest and sleep out of the\r\n    twenty-four; and very frequently they work all night.\r\n\r\n    \"625. Miss O'Neil, Welbeck street, an employer, says--'In the\r\n    spring season the hours of work are unlimited. The common hours\r\n    are from six a. m. till twelve at night--sometimes from four a. m.\r\n    till twelve. Has herself often worked from six a. m. till twelve\r\n    at night for two or three months together. It is not at all\r\n    uncommon, especially in the dressmaking, to work all night; just\r\n    in the 'drive of the season,' the work is occasionally continued\r\n    all night three times a-week. Has worked herself twice in the week\r\n    all night. In some houses which profess to study the health of\r\n    their young people, they begin at four a. m. and leave off at\r\n    eleven p. m., never earlier. Has heard there are houses in London\r\n    which work on Sundays.\r\n\r\n    \"628. Miss ---- ----, manager--'has been ten years a \"first hand,\"\r\n    which signifies the party who takes the superintendence of the\r\n    business, as overlooker of the young persons, cutter-out of the\r\n    work, &c. The common hours of business are from eight a. m. till\r\n    eleven p. m. in the winter; in the summer from six or half-past\r\n    six a. m. till twelve at night. During the fashionable season,\r\n    that is from April to the end of July, it frequently happens that\r\n    the ordinary hours are greatly exceeded: if there is a\r\n    drawing-room, or grand fete, or mourning to be made, it often\r\n    happens that the work goes on for twenty hours out of the\r\n    twenty-four, occasionally all night. Every season in at least\r\n    half the houses of business, it happens that the young persons\r\n    occasionally work twenty hours out of the twenty-four, twice or\r\n    thrice a-week. On special occasions, such as drawing-rooms,\r\n    general mournings, and very frequently wedding orders, it is not\r\n    uncommon to work all night; has herself worked twenty hours out of\r\n    the twenty-four for three months together; at that time she was\r\n    suffering from illness, and the medical attendant remonstrated\r\n    against the treatment she received. He wished witness to remain in\r\n    bed at least one day longer, which the employer objected to,\r\n    required her to get up, and dismissed the surgeon. It frequently\r\n    happened that the work was carried on till seven o'clock on Sunday\r\n    morning. If any particular order was to be executed, as mournings\r\n    or weddings, and they left off on Saturday night at eleven, they\r\n    worked the whole of Sunday; thinks this happened fifteen times in\r\n    the two years. In consequence of working so late on Sunday\r\n    morning, or all that day occasionally, could very rarely go to\r\n    church; indeed it could not be thought of, because they generally\r\n    rested in bed.'\r\n\r\n    \"639. The correctness of these representations is confirmed, among\r\n    others, by the following medical witnesses:--Sir James Clark,\r\n    Bart., Physician to the Queen--'I have found the mode of life of\r\n    these poor girls such as no constitution could long bear. Worked\r\n    from six in the morning till twelve at night, with the exception\r\n    of the short intervals allowed for their meals, in close rooms,\r\n    and passing the few hours allowed for rest in still more close and\r\n    crowded apartments--a mode of life more completely calculated to\r\n    destroy human health could scarcely be contrived, and this at a\r\n    period of life when exercise in the open air, and a due proportion\r\n    of rest, are essential to the development of the system. Judging\r\n    from what I have observed and heard, I scarcely believed that the\r\n    system adopted in our worst-regulated manufactories can be so\r\n    destructive of health as the life of the young dressmaker.'\r\n\r\n    \"647. 'The protracted labor described above,' says the\r\n    Sub-commissioner, 'is, I believe, quite unparalleled in the\r\n    history of manufacturing processes. I have looked over a\r\n    considerable portion of the Report of the Factory Commission, and\r\n    there is nothing in the accounts of the worst-conducted factories\r\n    to be compared with the facts elicited in the present enquiry.\r\n    Gentlemen who, from their official situation, were well qualified\r\n    to judge, have also stated, in answer to my questions, that they\r\n    knew of no instance in which the hours of work were so long as\r\n    those above stated.'\r\n\r\n    \"663. Of the general treatment and condition of these young\r\n    people, the Sub-commissioner reports:--'The evidence of all\r\n    parties establishes the fact that there is no class of persons in\r\n    this country, living by their labor, whose happiness, health, and\r\n    lives, are so unscrupulously sacrificed as those of the young\r\n    dressmakers. It may without exaggeration be stated, that, in\r\n    proportion to the numbers employed, there are no occupations, with\r\n    one or two questionable exceptions, such as needle-grinding, in\r\n    which so much disease is produced as in dressmaking, or which\r\n    present so fearful a catalogue of distressing and frequently fatal\r\n    maladies. It is a serious aggravation of all this evil, that the\r\n    unkindness of the employer very frequently causes these young\r\n    persons, when they become unwell, to conceal their illness from\r\n    the fear of being sent out of the house; and in this manner, the\r\n    disease often becomes increased in severity, or is even rendered\r\n    incurable. Some of the principals are so cruel as to object to the\r\n    young women obtaining medical assistance.'\"--(No. 626.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LONDON GLOBE ON WEST INDIA EMANCIPATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the following frank and explicit admission in the Globe of 10th\r\nJuly, 1856:\r\n\r\n    \"Our own West India Islands are fast relapsing into primitive\r\n    savageness. When the rich lands of Jamaica are being yearly\r\n    abandoned, and when in Trinidad and Guiana cultivation has almost\r\n    ceased, it is not likely that England will care to extend her\r\n    sovereignty further over tropical territory, which can only be\r\n    brought into use by a system which has been solemnly condemned.\"\r\n\r\nNow, let us rigidly examine and ascertain what is the condemned system,\r\nwhat the approved system, that has been generally adopted in its stead,\r\nand why this system is approved, and the free negro system condemned as\r\na failure.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt the writer alludes to the system of domestic slavery,\r\nin the general, as the condemned system; and especially, to that serfdom\r\nor villienage which lately prevailed, but is now abolished throughout\r\nWestern Europe. In asserting that the system of slavery has been\r\ncondemned, and yet admitting West India emancipation to be a failure, he\r\nin effect maintains that the liberation of the villiens has been no\r\nfailure. He means that it has been no failure, because the liberated\r\nvilliens do work: aye, just twice as hard and as long as their\r\nancestors, the serfs. He means it is no failure, because they not only\r\nwork harder and longer, but work for half the pay or allowance of their\r\nservile ancestors. He means it is no failure, because the once masters,\r\nnow employers, get their labor for half what it cost to support them as\r\nslaves. He means it is no failure, because free labor in England is more\r\nplentiful and far cheaper than slave labor in America. He means it is no\r\nfailure, because the employers, besides getting cheaper and more\r\nabundant labor, are relieved of all the cares and anxieties of governing\r\nand providing for their laborers, in health and in sickness, in old age\r\nand in infancy. In fine, he means it is no failure, because the laborers\r\nof England are not half so free now as before their pretended\r\nemancipation. They have lost all their rights, half their liberty (for\r\nthey work harder than before,) and their former masters have been\r\nrelieved of all their legal obligations and responsibilities.\r\nNo--British emancipation has not failed, if we look solely to the\r\nselfish interests of the property class. And British liberty, we shall\r\nshow in another chapter, means the unlimited right of the property class\r\nto oppress the laboring class, uncoupled with the obligation to provide\r\nfor them. But this writer well knew, that looking to the effect of\r\nemancipation on the condition of the laboring class in England, it has\r\nbeen a cruel and monstrous failure, from first to last. They are almost\r\nas savage and ignorant as West India negroes, know nothing of the Bible,\r\nand live in a state of continued destitution, hunger, and excessive\r\nlabor, from generation to generation--from infancy to old age.\r\n\r\nWest India emancipation was a blunder of swindling philanthropy. People\r\nwere told that the negroes, after emancipation, would work harder, work\r\nfor less, and be more of slaves than before, just as had happened with\r\nemancipated English. But philanthropy \"hath bad luck.\" It overlooked, or\r\nforgot, the few wants and indolent habits of the negro, the abundance of\r\nmountain lands, the fertile soil, the volunteer fruits and mild climate\r\nof Jamaica. The negro _is really_ free, and luxuriates in sloth,\r\nignorance and liberty, as none but a negro can. The mistake and the\r\nfailure consisted in setting him really free, instead of nominally so.\r\nHinc illae lachrymae!\r\n\r\nWhat vile hypocrisy to shed crocodile tears over the happy negro, and\r\nboast of British Liberty, which is daily and hourly consuming, by\r\npoverty, and cold, and foul air and water, and downright starvation, the\r\nlives of ten millions of your white brethren and neighbors!\r\n\r\nBut this system, which carried to untimely graves three hundred thousand\r\nIrishmen in a single season, has not been _condemned_. No; it is\r\nprofitable to the oppressors, and will not be condemned.\r\n\r\nIn all countries where a few own the property and the population is\r\ntolerably dense, laborers relieved from domestic slavery are remitted to\r\nthe exploitation of skill and capital, which renders them less free and\r\nworse situated in all respects after emancipation than before. To prove\r\nthis great truth, is the chief object of our present work. We know that\r\nthe philosophy of the subject is intricate and complex, and that we have\r\nthe prejudices, fanaticism and prepossessions of a world to oppose and\r\nconquer. We therefore indulge in frequent iteration, and adduce numerous\r\nproofs, examples and illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nPROTECTION, AND CHARITY, TO THE WEAK.\r\n\r\n\r\nA mere verbal formula often distinguishes a truism from a paradox. \"It\r\nis the duty of society to protect the weak;\" but protection cannot be\r\nefficient without the power of control; therefore, \"It is the duty of\r\nsociety to enslave the weak.\" And it is a duty which no organized and\r\ncivilized society ever failed to perform. Parents, husbands, guardians,\r\nteachers, committees, &c, are but masters under another name, whose duty\r\nit is to protect the weak, and whose right it is to control them. The\r\nblacks in America are both positively and relatively weak. Positively\r\nso, because they are too improvident to lay up for the exigencies of\r\nsickness, of the seasons, or of old age. Relatively so, because they are\r\nwholly unequal to the whites among whom they live, in the war of the\r\nwits and free competition, which universal liberty begets, and political\r\neconomy encourages.\r\n\r\nIn old countries the white laborers are relatively weak, because all\r\nproperty is closely appropriated, and the capitalist class possess the\r\nmeans of unlimited oppression. Everybody admits that in such countries\r\nthe poor need protection. But there can be no efficient protection\r\nwithout enslavement of some sort. In England, it has often been\r\nremarked, that all the legislation for the poor is borrowed from the\r\nsystem of domestic slavery.\r\n\r\nPublic and private charity is a fund created by the labor of the\r\nindustrious poor, and too often bestowed on the idle or improvident. It\r\nis apt to aggravate the evils which it intends to cure.\r\n\r\nThose who give should have the power to control, to some extent, the\r\nconduct and expenditure of the objects of their charity. Not till then\r\ncan they be sure that their gifts will be promotive of good. But such\r\npower of control would be slavery.\r\n\r\nCan abolitionists solve these social problems?\r\n\r\nAmbition has ever been considered the most noble of human failings. It\r\nis, however, no failing, or crime, at all. Ambition desires power, and\r\nwithout power there can be no safe, prudent and active benevolence. The\r\nselfish, the indolent, and the timid, are without ambition, and eschew\r\npower, because of the trouble, the expenses, and the responsibilities\r\nwhich it imposes. The actively good are always ambitious, and desire to\r\npossess power, in order that they may control, in some measure, the\r\nconduct of those whom they desire to benefit.\r\n\r\nThe best thing a philanthropist can do, is to buy slaves, because then\r\nhis power of control is greatest--his ability to do practical good, most\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nWe take this occasion to correct an error into which we had fallen as\r\nto Northern character. Benevolence, affection, generosity, and\r\nphilanthropy, are equally common North and South; and only differ in\r\ntheir modes of manifestation. We are one people.\r\n\r\nThe daily and hourly exercise of these qualities is elicited at the\r\nSouth, because it is safe, prudent and expedient so to exercise them.\r\nThe reverse is true at the North: yet, \"expel Nature and she will return\r\nagain.\" Man is social and philanthropic, and his affections, dammed out\r\nin one direction, find vent and gush out in another. The people of the\r\nNorth are far more generous and munificent in the endowment of public\r\ncharities, and other public institutions, than we. This correction of\r\nour error does not affect our theories--if it be true, that you can only\r\nsafely be charitable to dependents whom you can control. But if it did\r\nor does affect, neutralize and subvert them, it is due to truth,--and if\r\nwe advance the cause of truth, we are ready for the sacrifice of all\r\nelse.\r\n\r\n\"Our Trip to the North\" excited doubts as to our estimate of Northern\r\ncharacter; and subsequent observation, reading and reflection, have\r\nbrought us to the conclusion, which we now with pleasure avow. We would\r\nrather be right than consistent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE FAMILY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll modern philosophy converges to a single point--the overthrow of all\r\ngovernment, the substitution of the untrammelled \"Sovereignty of the\r\nIndividual,\" for the Sovereignty of Society, and the inauguration of\r\nanarchy. First domestic slavery, next religious institutions, then\r\nseparate property, then political government, and, finally, family\r\ngovernment and family relations, are to be swept away. This is the\r\ndistinctly avowed programme of all able abolitionists and socialists:\r\nand towards this end the doctrines and the practices of the weakest and\r\nmost timid among them tend. Proudhon, and the French socialists\r\ngenerally, avow this purpose in France, and Stephen Pearl Andrews\r\nre-echoes it from America. The more numerous and timid class are\r\nrepresented by Mr. Greeley and the Tribune, who would not \"at once\r\nrush,\" like French revolutionists, \"with the explosive force of\r\nescapement, point blank to the bull's eye of its final destiny,\" but\r\nwould inaugurate social conditions, that would gradually bring about\r\nthat result. Mr. Greeley does not propose to do away at once with\r\nmarriage, religion, private property, political government and parental\r\nauthority, but adopts the philosophy and the practices of Fourier, which\r\npromise gradually to purify human nature, and fit it, in a few\r\ngenerations, for that social millenium, into which the bolder and more\r\nconsistent Andrews urges society at once to plunge.\r\n\r\nThe Christian socialists are beautifully and energetically co-laborating\r\nwith the infidel socialists and abolitionists to bring about this\r\nmillenium. They also are divided into two parties. The one would wait\r\nupon Providence--only help it a little, like Mr. Greeley--and permit our\r\npoor old effete world to pass out of existence by gentle euthanasia. The\r\nother and bolder party, feel themselves \"called\" as special instruments,\r\nto give at once the coup de grace to the old world, and to usher in the\r\nnew golden age, of free love and free lands, of free women and free\r\nnegroes, of free children and free men.\r\n\r\nWe like the Northern socialist theoretical abolitionists--read their\r\nspeeches, essays, lectures and books, because they agree with us, that\r\ntheir own form of society is a humbug and a failure; and in their\r\nefforts, speculations and schemes to re-organize it, afford the most\r\nbeautiful, perfect and complete specimen of the reductio ad absurdum. A\r\nlecture from Mr. Andrews on No-government, an Oneida den of incest, a\r\nGreeley phalanstery, or a New York free love saloon, afford equally good\r\ninstances of this mode of demonstration by the absurdities which they\r\nexhibit, and equally good proofs of the naturalness and necessity of\r\nslavery, since such horrid abuses are everywhere the approved and\r\npracticed outgrowth of free society. As all our thoughts, arguments,\r\nproofs and demonstrations are suggested by or borrowed from the\r\nabolitionists, it seems to us we ought to dedicate to them. The Tribune\r\nvery properly remarked that our Sociology was the first attempt of the\r\nkind at the South. It ridiculed our ignorance, too, severely. It should\r\nhave recollected that were there no sickness there would be no\r\nphysicians. We assure the Tribune, we are quite a prodigy in these\r\nmatters for a Southern man. We have no social diseases, and therefore no\r\nsocial doctors to write about them or cure them. Such diseases have been\r\nrare: for Aristotle complains that there are no terms to express the\r\nrelations of husband and wife, or parent and child. These relations have\r\nworked so smoothly in slave society to this day, that we in writing have\r\nfelt the same want of language of which Aristotle, more than two\r\nthousand years ago, complained. You should invent such terms at the\r\nNorth, if it be true, as Mr. Andrews states in italics, that there are\r\nten fugitives from Northern matrimony to one from Southern slavery--from\r\nwhich he seems to infer very logically, that the necessity of abolishing\r\nthe family at the North, is ten times as great as that for abolishing\r\nslavery at the South. He and you are experts, and we know it is\r\npresumptuous in us to dispute what you say about your own society. Still\r\nwe are dead against your phalansteries and his love saloons. Gentlemen\r\nand scholars, generally at the South, would as soon be caught studying\r\nor practicing the black art, as in reading Owen or Fourier, or in\r\nbuilding phalansteries. For ourselves, like the Bastard in King John, we\r\nlearn these things, \"not to deceive, but to avoid deceit.\" We have whole\r\nfiles of infidel and abolition papers, like the Tribune, the Liberator\r\nand Investigator. Fanny Wright, the Devil's Pulpit and the Devil's\r\nParson, Tom Paine, Owen, Voltaire, et id genus omne, are our daily\r\ncompanions. Good people give our office a wide berth as they pass it,\r\nand even the hens who loiter about it, have caught the infection of\r\nWoman's Rights, for we saw but as few days ago a Shanghai cock under its\r\neaves hovering a brood of twenty chickens, whilst madam hen was\r\nstrutting about in as large a liberty as any Bloomer or wise woman of\r\nthe North.\r\n\r\nLove and veneration for the family is with us not only a principle, but\r\nprobably a prejudice and a weakness. We were never two weeks at a time\r\nfrom under the family roof, until we had passed middle life, and now\r\nthat our years almost number half a century, we have never been from\r\nhome for an interval of two months. And our historical reading, as well\r\nas our habits of life, may have unfitted us to appreciate the communist\r\nand fusion theories of Fanny Wright, Owen and Mr. Greely. In attempting\r\nto vindicate and justify the ways of God and Nature, against the\r\nprogressiveness of Black Republicanism in America, and Red Republicanism\r\nin Europe, we would forewarn the reader that we are a prejudiced\r\nwitness. We are the enthusiastic admirer of the social relations\r\nexhibited in the histories of Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. The social\r\nrelations established in Deuteronomy, and 25th chapter Leviticus, and as\r\npracticed by the Jews to this day, elicit our unfeigned admiration and\r\napproval. Moses is with us the Prince of Legislators, and the\r\ntwenty-fifth Leviticus the best of political platforms. The purity of\r\nthe family seems to be his paramount object.\r\n\r\nHomer, too, especially in his Odyssey, charms and enchains us with his\r\nbeautiful descriptions of family felicity and family purity. As conquest\r\nand commerce introduced wealth and corrupted morals and manners, the\r\nfamily was corrupted and disrupted, as it is now, at the most commercial\r\npoints in the North. But we have only to pass over to Italy, and there,\r\nfrom the earliest days of tradition until the extinction of liberty,\r\nbegan by Sylla and Marius, and ended by Augustus, we find the family a\r\npure, a holy and sacred thing. From that era till slavery arose in the\r\nSouth, the family never resumed its dignity and importance. Feudalism\r\ndid something to correct the loose morality of the Augustan Age, but it\r\nadopted its colonial slavery, relaxed family ties, and never drew\r\ntogether in sufficiently close connection and subordination, the\r\nmaterials which nature dictates should form the human hive or social\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nAristotle understood this subject thoroughly; and it seems to have been\r\ngenerally so well comprehended in his day, that he takes little trouble\r\nto explain and expound it. He commences his treatise on Politics and\r\nEconomics with the family, and discourses first of the slaves as a part\r\nof the family. He assumes that social life is as natural to man as to\r\nbees and herds; and that the family, including husband, wife, children,\r\nand slaves, is the first and most natural development of that social\r\nnature. As States are composed of families, and as a sound and healthy\r\nwhole cannot be formed of rotten parts, he devotes much of his treatise\r\nto family education and government. Would that modern statesmen,\r\nphilosophers and politicians, would become practical like Aristotle, and\r\nnot attempt to build social and political edifices, until they were sure\r\nof the soundness of the materials of which they would construct them. As\r\nall human beings live for the greatest part of their lives in families,\r\nit is all important that they should look to the wise arrangement of\r\nthis old and universal institution.\r\n\r\nWe wish to prove that the great movement in society, known under various\r\nnames, as Communism, Socialism, Abolitionism, Red Republicanism and\r\nBlack Republicanism, has one common object: the breaking up of all law\r\nand government, and the inauguration of anarchy, and that the\r\ndestruction of the family is one of the means in which they all concur\r\nto attain a common end. We shall quote only from Stephen Pearle Andrews,\r\nbecause he is by far the ablest and best informed of American Socialists\r\nand Reformers, and because he cites facts and authorities to show that\r\nhe presents truly the current thought and the general intention. Mr.\r\nAndrews is a Massachusetts gentleman, who has lived at the South. He has\r\nbeen an Abolition Lecturer. He is the disciple of Warren, who is the\r\ndisciple of Owen of Lanark and New Harmony. Owen and Warren are Socrates\r\nand Plato, and he is the Great Stygarite, as far surpassing them, as\r\nAristotle surpassed Socrates and Plato. But it is not merely his\r\ntheories on which we rely; he cites historical facts that show that the\r\ntendency and terminus of all abolition is to the sovereignty of the\r\nindividual, the breaking up of families, and no-government. He delivered\r\na series of lectures to the elite of New York on this subject, which met\r\nwith approbation, and from which we shall quote. He established, or\r\naided to establish, Free Love Villages, and headed a Free Love Saloon\r\nin the city of New York, patronized and approved by the \"Higher\r\nclasses.\" He is indubitably the philosopher and true exponent of\r\nNorthern Abolitionism. With this assertion, which none who read his\r\nScience of Society we think will deny, we proceed to quote from his able\r\nand beautiful lectures, embodied in a publication entitled \"Science of\r\nSociety.\" Our first quotation is from his first lecture and the first\r\nchapter of his work:\r\n\r\n    Every age is a remarkable one, no doubt, for those who live in it.\r\n    When immobility reigns most in human affairs, there is still\r\n    enough of movement to fix the attention, and even to excite the\r\n    wonder of those who are immediately in proximity with it. This\r\n    natural bias in favor of the period with which we have most to do,\r\n    is by no means sufficient, however, to account for the growing\r\n    conviction, on all minds, that the present epoch is a marked\r\n    transition from an old to a new order of things. The scattered\r\n    rays of the gray dawn of the new era date back, indeed, beyond the\r\n    lifetime of the present generation. The first streak of light that\r\n    streamed through the dense darkness of the old _regime_ was the\r\n    declaration by Martin Luther of the right of private judgment in\r\n    matters of conscience. The next, which shed terror upon the old\r\n    world, as a new portent of impending revolutions, was the denial,\r\n    by Hampden, Sidney, Cromwell, and others, of the divine right of\r\n    kings, and the assertion of inherent political rights in the\r\n    people themselves. This was followed by the American Declaration\r\n    of Independence, the establishment of a powerful Democratic\r\n    Republic in the western world upon the basis of that principle,\r\n    followed by the French Revolution, the Reign of Terror, the\r\n    Re-action, and the apparent death in Europe of the Democratic\r\n    idea. Finally, in our day, comes the red glare of French\r\n    Socialism, at which the world is still gazing with uncertainty\r\n    whether it be some lurid and meteoric omen of fearful events, or\r\n    whether it be not the actual rising of the Sun of Righteousness,\r\n    with healing in His wings; for there are those who profoundly and\r\n    religiously believe that the solution of the social problem will\r\n    be the virtual descent of the New Jerusalem--the installation of\r\n    the Kingdom of Heaven upon earth.\r\n\r\n    First in the religious, then in the political, and finally in the\r\n    social relations of men, new doctrines have thus been broached,\r\n    which are full of promise to the hopeful, and full of alarm and\r\n    dismay to the timid and conservative. This distinction marks the\r\n    broadest division in the ranks of mankind. In church, and state,\r\n    and social life, the real parties are the Progressionists and the\r\n    Retrogressionists--those whose most brilliant imaginings are\r\n    linked with the future, and those whose sweetest remembrances bind\r\n    them in tender associations to the past. Catholic and Protestant,\r\n    Whig and Democrat, Anti-Socialist and Socialist, are terms which,\r\n    in their origin, correspond to this generic division; but no\r\n    sooner does a new classification take place than the parties thus\r\n    formed are again subdivided, on either hand, by the\r\n    ever-permeating tendency, on the one side toward freedom,\r\n    emancipation, and progress, and toward law, and order, and\r\n    immobility on the other.\r\n\r\n    Hitherto the struggle between conservatism and progress has seemed\r\n    doubtful. Victory has kissed the banner, alternately, of either\r\n    host. At length the serried ranks of conservatism falter. Reform,\r\n    so called, is becoming confessedly more potent than its\r\n    antagonist. The admission is reluctantly forced from pallid lips\r\n    that revolutions--political, social and religious--constitute the\r\n    programme of the coming age. Reform, so called, for weal or woe,\r\n    but yet Reform, must rule the hour. The older constitutions of\r\n    society have outlived their day. No truth commends itself more\r\n    universally to the minds of men now, than that thus set forth by\r\n    Carlyle: \"There must be a new world if there is to be any world at\r\n    all. That human things in our Europe can ever return to the old\r\n    sorry routine, and proceed with any steadiness or continuance\r\n    there--this small hope is not now a tenable one. These days of\r\n    universal death must be days of universal new birth, if the ruin\r\n    is not to be total and final! It is a time to make the dullest man\r\n    consider, and ask himself, Whence he came? Whither he is bound? A\r\n    veritable 'New Era,' to the foolish as well as to the wise.\" Nor\r\n    is this state of things confined to Europe. The agitations in\r\n    America may be more peaceful, but they are not less profound. The\r\n    foundations of old beliefs and habits of thought are breaking up.\r\n    The old guarantees of order are fast falling away. A veritable\r\n    \"new era\" with us, too, is alike impending and inevitable.\r\n\r\nSo much to show the width and scope of the social revolution that is\r\ncontemplated as well by destructives as conservatives; for Mr. Carlyle\r\nis like ourselves, and thinks society needs more government, screwing\r\nup, instead of relaxing. He, too, is a socialist, but a conservative\r\nsocialist. He asserts, like Mr. Andrews, that society has failed, but\r\nproposes a different mode of reconstruction. At the very moment we in\r\nAmerica were announcing the Failure of Free Society, he in Europe\r\nproclaimed the 'Latter Day' of that Society. It was but a different mode\r\nof expressing the same thought. Now we will show from this same lecture\r\nof Mr. Andrews, that the annihilation of the Family is part of the\r\nprogramme of Abolition. He says, page 31, in this same lecture:\r\n\r\n    Every variety of conscience, and every variety of deportment in\r\n    reference to this precise subject of love is already tolerated\r\n    among us. At one extreme of the scale stand the Shakers, who\r\n    abjure the connection of the sexes altogether. At the other\r\n    extremity stands the association of Perfectionists, at Oneida, who\r\n    hold and practice, and justify by the Scriptures, as a religious\r\n    dogma, what they denominate complex marriage, or the freedom of\r\n    love. We have, in this State, stringent laws against adultery and\r\n    fornication; but laws of that sort fall powerless, in America,\r\n    before the all-pervading sentiment of Protestantism, which\r\n    vindicates the freedom of conscience to all persons and in all\r\n    things, provided the consequences fall upon the parties\r\n    themselves. Hence the Oneida Perfectionists live undisturbed and\r\n    respected, in the heart of the State of New York, and in the face\r\n    of the world; and the civil government, true to the Democratic\r\n    principle, which is only the same principle in another\r\n    application, is little anxious to interfere with this breach of\r\n    its own ordinances, so long as they cast none of the consequences\r\n    of their conduct upon those who do not consent to bear them.\r\n\r\nAnd, page 33, he says:\r\n\r\n    In general, however, Government still interferes with the marriage\r\n    and parental relations. Democracy in America has always proceeded\r\n    with due reference to the prudential motto, _festina lente_. In\r\n    France, at the time of the first Revolution, Democracy rushed with\r\n    the explosive force of escapement from centuries of compression,\r\n    point blank to the bull's eye of its final destiny, from which it\r\n    recoiled with such force that the stupid world has dreamed, for\r\n    half a century, that the vital principle of Democracy was dead. As\r\n    a logical sequence from Democratic principle, the legal obligation\r\n    of marriage was sundered, and the Sovereignty of the Individual\r\n    above the institution was vindicated.\r\n\r\nPage 42:\r\n\r\n    I must apologize as well for the incompleteness as for the\r\n    apparent dogmatism of any brief exposition of this subject. I\r\n    assert that it is not only possible and rationally probable, but\r\n    that it is rigidly consequential upon the right understanding of\r\n    the constitution of man, that all government, in the sense of\r\n    involuntary restraint upon the Individual, or substantially all,\r\n    must finally cease, and along with it the whole complicated\r\n    paraphernalia and trumpery of Kings, Emperors, Presidents,\r\n    Legislatures, and Judiciary. I assert that the indicia of this\r\n    result abound in existing society, and that it is the instinctive\r\n    or intelligent perception of that fact by those who have not\r\n    bargained for so much, which gives origin and vital energy to the\r\n    re-action in church and state and social life. I assert that the\r\n    distance is less to-day forward from the theory and practice of\r\n    Government as it is in these United States, to the total\r\n    abrogation of all Government above that of the Individual, than it\r\n    is backward to the theory and practice of Government as Government\r\n    now is in the despotic countries of the old world.\r\n\r\nThe reader will thus see that Abolition contemplates the total overthrow\r\nof the Family and all other existing social, moral, religious and\r\ngovernmental institutions. We quote Mr. Andrews because he is 'longo\r\nintervallo,' the ablest Abolition Philosopher. Many volumes would be\r\nneeded to display and expose the opinions of all the votaries of the New\r\nPhilosophy. But every man who sets to work honestly to discover truth,\r\nwill find at every step, that we have neither distorted nor exaggerated.\r\nThe Family is threatened, and all men North or South who love and revere\r\nit, should be up and a doing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nNEGRO SLAVERY.\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the lands of America are appropriated by a few, population becomes\r\ndense, competition among laborers active, employment uncertain, and\r\nwages low, the personal liberty of all the whites will continue to be a\r\nblessing. We have vast unsettled territories; population may cease to\r\nincrease, or increase slowly, as in most countries, and many centuries\r\nmay elapse before the question will be practically suggested, whether\r\nslavery to capital be preferable to slavery to human masters. But the\r\nnegro has neither energy nor enterprise, and, even in our sparser\r\npopulation, finds, with his improvident habits, that his liberty is a\r\ncurse to himself, and a greater curse to the society around him. These\r\nconsiderations, and others equally obvious, have induced the South to\r\nattempt to defend negro slavery as an exceptional institution,\r\nadmitting, nay asserting, that slavery, in the general or in the\r\nabstract, is morally wrong, and against common right. With singular\r\ninconsistency, after making this admission, which admits away the\r\nauthority of the Bible, of profane history, and of the almost universal\r\npractice of mankind--they turn round and attempt to bolster up the cause\r\nof negro slavery by these very exploded authorities. If we mean not to\r\nrepudiate all divine, and almost all human authority in favor of\r\nslavery, we must vindicate that institution in the abstract.\r\n\r\nTo insist that a status of society, which has been almost universal, and\r\nwhich is expressly and continually justified by Holy Writ, is its\r\nnatural, normal, and necessary status, under the ordinary circumstances,\r\nis on its face a plausible and probable proposition. To insist on less,\r\nis to yield our cause, and to give up our religion; for if white slavery\r\nbe morally wrong, be a violation of natural rights, the Bible cannot be\r\ntrue. Human and divine authority do seem in the general to concur, in\r\nestablishing the expediency of having masters and slaves of different\r\nraces. The nominal servitude of the Jews to each other, in its temporary\r\ncharacter, and no doubt in its mild character, more nearly resembled our\r\nwardship and apprenticeship, than ordinary domestic slavery. In very\r\nmany nations of antiquity, and in some of modern times, the law has\r\npermitted the native citizens to become slaves to each other. But few\r\ntake advantage of such laws; and the infrequency of the practice,\r\nestablishes the general truth that master and slave should be of\r\ndifferent national descent. In some respects, the wider the difference\r\nthe better, as the slave will feel less mortified by his position. In\r\nother respects, it may be that too wide a difference hardens the hearts\r\nand brutalizes the feelings of both master and slave. The civilized man\r\nhates the savage, and the savage returns the hatred with interest.\r\nHence, West India slavery, of newly caught negroes, is not a very\r\nhumane, affectionate or civilizing institution. Virginia negroes have\r\nbecome moral and intelligent. They love their master and his family, and\r\nthe attachment is reciprocated. Still, we like the idle, but intelligent\r\nhouse-servants, better than the hard-used, but stupid out-hands; and we\r\nlike the mulatto better than the negro; yet the negro is generally more\r\naffectionate, contented and faithful.\r\n\r\nThe world at large looks on negro slavery as much the worst form of\r\nslavery; because it is only acquainted with West India slavery.\r\nAbolition never arose till negro slavery was instituted; and now\r\nabolition is only directed against negro slavery. There is no\r\nphilanthropic crusade attempting to set free the white slaves of Eastern\r\nEurope and of Asia. The world, then, is prepared for the defence of\r\nslavery in the abstract--it is prejudiced only against negro slavery.\r\nThese prejudices were in their origin well founded. The Slave Trade, the\r\nhorrors of the Middle Passage, and West India slavery, were enough to\r\nrouse the most torpid philanthropy.\r\n\r\nBut our Southern slavery has become a benign and protective institution,\r\nand our negroes are confessedly better off than any free laboring\r\npopulation in the world.\r\n\r\nHow can we contend that white slavery is wrong, whilst all the great\r\nbody of free laborers are starving; and slaves, white or black,\r\nthroughout the world, are enjoying comfort?\r\n\r\nWe write in the cause of Truth and Humanity, and will not play the\r\nadvocate for master or for slave.\r\n\r\nThe aversion to negroes, the antipathy of race, is much greater at the\r\nNorth than at the South; and it is very probable that this antipathy to\r\nthe person of the negro, is confounded with or generates hatred of the\r\ninstitution with which he is usually connected. Hatred to slavery is\r\nvery generally little more than hatred of negroes.\r\n\r\nThere is one strong argument in favor of negro slavery over all other\r\nslavery: that he, being unfitted for the mechanic arts, for trade, and\r\nall skillful pursuits, leaves those pursuits to be carried on by the\r\nwhites; and does not bring all industry into disrepute, as in Greece and\r\nRome, where the slaves were not only the artists and mechanics, but also\r\nthe merchants.\r\n\r\nWhilst, as a general and abstract question, negro slavery has no other\r\nclaims over other forms of slavery, except that from inferiority, or\r\nrather peculiarity, of race, almost all negroes require masters, whilst\r\nonly the children, the women, the very weak, poor, and ignorant, &c,\r\namong the whites, need some protective and governing relation of this\r\nkind; yet as a subject of temporary, but world-wide importance, negro\r\nslavery has become the most necessary of all human institutions.\r\n\r\nThe African slave trade to America commenced three centuries and a half\r\nsince. By the time of the American Revolution, the supply of slaves had\r\nexceeded the demand for slave labor, and the slaveholders, to get rid of\r\na burden, and to prevent the increase of a nuisance, became violent\r\nopponents of the slave trade, and many of them abolitionists. New\r\nEngland, Bristol, and Liverpool, who reaped the profits of the trade,\r\nwithout suffering from the nuisance, stood out for a long time against\r\nits abolition. Finally, laws and treaties were made, and fleets fitted\r\nout to abolish it; and after a while, the slaves of most of South\r\nAmerica, of the West Indies, and of Mexico were liberated. In the\r\nmeantime, cotton, rice, sugar, coffee, tobacco, and other products of\r\nslave labor, came into universal use as necessaries of life. The\r\npopulation of Western Europe, sustained and stimulated by those\r\nproducts, was trebled, and that of the North increased tenfold. The\r\nproducts of slave labor became scarce and dear, and famines frequent.\r\nNow, it is obvious, that to emancipate all the negroes would be to\r\nstarve Western Europe and our North. Not to extend and increase negro\r\nslavery, _pari passu_, with the extension and multiplication of free\r\nsociety, will produce much suffering. If all South America, Mexico, the\r\nWest Indies, and our Union south of Mason and Dixon's line, of the Ohio\r\nand Missouri, were slaveholding, slave products would be abundant and\r\ncheap in free society; and their market for their merchandise,\r\nmanufactures, commerce, &c., illimitable. Free white laborers might live\r\nin comfort and luxury on light work, but for the exacting and greedy\r\nlandlords, bosses and other capitalists.\r\n\r\nWe must confess, that overstock the world as you will with comforts and\r\nwith luxuries, we do not see how to make capital relax its monopoly--how\r\nto do aught but tantalize the hireling. Capital, irresponsible capital,\r\nbegets, and ever will beget, the \"immedicabile vulnus\" of so-called Free\r\nSociety. It invades every recess of domestic life, infects its food, its\r\nclothing, its drink, its very atmosphere, and pursues the hireling, from\r\nthe hovel to the poor-house, the prison and the grave. Do what he will,\r\ngo where he will, capital pursues and persecutes him. \"Haeret lateri\r\nlethalis arundo!\"\r\n\r\nCapital supports and protects the domestic slave; taxes, oppresses and\r\npersecutes the free laborer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE STRENGTH OF WEAKNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn unexplored moral world stretches out before us, and invites our\r\ninvestigation; but neither our time, our abilities, nor the character of\r\nour work, will permit us to do more than glance at its loveliness.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasing, however, to turn from the world of political economy, in\r\nwhich \"might makes right,\" and strength of mind and of body are employed\r\nto oppress and exact from the weak, to that other and better, and far\r\nmore numerous world, in which weakness rules, clad in the armor of\r\naffection and benevolence. It is delightful to retire from the outer\r\nworld, with its competitions, rivalries, envyings, jealousies, and\r\nselfish war of the wits, to the bosom of the family, where the only\r\ntyrant is the infant--the greatest slave the master of the household.\r\nYou feel at once that you have exchanged the keen air of selfishness,\r\nfor the mild atmosphere of benevolence. Each one prefers the good of\r\nothers to his own, and finds most happiness in sacrificing selfish\r\npleasures, and ministering to others' enjoyments. The wife, the husband,\r\nthe parent, the child, the son, the brother and the sister, usually act\r\ntowards each other on scriptural principles. The infant, in its\r\ncapricious dominion over mother, father, brothers and sisters, exhibits,\r\nin strongest colors, the \"strength of weakness,\" the power of affection.\r\nThe wife and daughters are more carefully attended by the father, than\r\nthe sons, because they are weaker and elicit more of his affection.\r\n\r\nThe dependent exercise, because of their dependence, as much control\r\nover their superiors, in most things, as those superiors exercise over\r\nthem. Thus, and thus only, can conditions be equalized. This constitutes\r\npractical equality of rights, enforced not by human, but by divine law.\r\nOur hearts bleed at the robbing of a bird's nest; and the little birds,\r\nbecause they are weak, subdue our strength and command our care. We love\r\nand cherish the rose, and sympathize with the lily, which some wanton\r\nboy has bruised and broken. Our faithful dog shares our affections, and\r\nwe will risk our lives to redress injustice done him.\r\n\r\nMan is not all selfish. \"Might does not always make right.\" Within the\r\nfamily circle, the law of love prevails, not that of selfishness.\r\n\r\nBut, besides wife and children, brothers and sisters, dogs, horses,\r\nbirds and flowers--slaves, also, belong to the family circle. Does their\r\ncommon humanity, their abject weakness and dependence, their great\r\nvalue, their ministering to our wants in childhood, manhood, sickness\r\nand old age, cut them off from that affection which everything else in\r\nthe family elicits? No; the interests of master and slave are bound up\r\ntogether, and each in his appropriate sphere naturally endeavers to\r\npromote the happiness of the other.\r\n\r\nThe humble and obedient slave exercises more or less control over the\r\nmost brutal and hard-hearted master. It is an invariable law of nature,\r\nthat weakness and dependence are elements of strength, and generally\r\nsufficiently limit that universal despotism, observable throughout human\r\nand animal nature. The moral and physical world is but a series of\r\nsubordinations, and the more perfect the subordination, the greater the\r\nharmony and the happiness. Inferior and superior act and re-act on each\r\nother through agencies and media too delicate and subtle for human\r\napprehensions; yet, looking to usual results, man should be willing to\r\nleave to God what God only can regulate. Human law cannot beget\r\nbenevolence, affection, maternal and paternal love; nor can it supply\r\ntheir places: but it may, by breaking up the ordinary relations of human\r\nbeings, stop and disturb the current of these finer feelings of our\r\nnature. It may abolish slavery; but it can never create between the\r\ncapitalist and the laborer, between the employer and employed, the kind\r\nand affectionate relations that usually exist between master and slave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nMONEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the days of Plato and Lycurgus to the present times, Social\r\nReformers have sought to restrict or banish the use of money. We do not\r\ndoubt that its moderate use is essential to civilization and promotive\r\nof human happiness and well-being--and we entertain as little doubt,\r\nthat its excessive use is the most potent of all causes of human\r\ninequality of condition, of excessive wealth and luxury with the few,\r\nand of great destitution and suffering with the many, and of general\r\neffeminacy and corruption of morals. Money is the great weapon in free,\r\nequal, and competitive society, which skill and capital employ in the\r\nwar of the wits, to exploitate and oppress the poor, the improvident,\r\nand weak-minded. Its evil effects are greatly aggravated by the credit\r\nand banking systems, and by the facilities of intercommunication and\r\nlocomotion which the world now possesses. Every bargain or exchange is\r\nmore or less a hostile encounter of wits. Money vastly increases the\r\nnumber of bargains and exchanges, and thus keep society involved, if not\r\nin war, at least in unfriendly collision. Within the family, money is\r\nnot employed between its members. Where the family includes slaves, the\r\naggregate use of money is greatly restricted. This furnishes us with\r\nanother argument to prove that Christian morality is practicable, to a\r\ngreat extent, in slave society--impracticable in free society.\r\n\r\nThe Socialists derive this idea of dispensing with or restricting the\r\nuse of money, from Sparta and other ancient States; and to the same\r\nsources may be traced almost all their schemes of social improvement.\r\nPlato, in his philosophy, borrowed from those sources, and subsequent\r\nSocialists have borrowed from him. We annex an interesting article on\r\nthis subject of money from Sir Thomas Moore's Utopia:\r\n\r\n    UTOPIA; OR, THE HAPPY REPUBLIC.\r\n\r\n    \"Therefore, I must say that, as I hope for mercy, I can have no\r\n    other notion of all the governments that I see or know, than that\r\n    they are a conspiracy of the richer sort, who, on pretence of\r\n    managing the public, do only pursue their private ends, and devise\r\n    all the ways and arts that they can find out; first, that they\r\n    may, without danger, preserve all they have so ill acquired, and\r\n    then, that they may engage the former sort to toil and labor for\r\n    them at as low rates as possible, and oppress them as much as they\r\n    please; and if they can but prevail to get these contrivances\r\n    established by public authority, which is considered as the\r\n    representative of the whole people, then they are accounted laws;\r\n    and yet these wicked men, after they have, by a most insatiable\r\n    covetousness, divided that among themselves, with which all the\r\n    rest might have been well supplied, are far from that happiness\r\n    that is enjoyed by the Utopians; _for the use us well as the\r\n    desire of money being extinguished_, there is much anxiety and\r\n    great occasion of mischief cut off with it. And who does not see\r\n    that frauds, thefts, robberies, quarrels, tumults, contentions,\r\n    seditions, murders, treacheries and witchcrafts, that are indeed\r\n    rather punished than restricted by the severities of the law,\r\n    would fall off, if money were not any more valued by the world.\r\n    Their fears, solicitudes, cares, labors and watchings would all\r\n    perish in the same moment that the value of money did sink.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nGERRIT SMITH ON LAND REFORM, AND WILLIAM LOYD GARRISON ON NO-GOVERNMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the last week, we have received the _Land Reformer_, an agrarian\r\npaper, just started in New York, in which we are sure we recognize the\r\npen of Gerrit Smith, the leader of the New York abolitionists; and also\r\na No. of the Liberator, in which Mr. Garrison, the leader of the New\r\nEngland abolitionists, defines his No-Government doctrines.\r\n\r\nIn calling attention, North and South, to opinions openly and actively\r\npromulgated by such distinguished men, which opinions are at war with\r\nall existing institutions, we are rendering equal service to all\r\nsections of our common country.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith says:\r\n\r\n    \"Why should not this monopoly be broken up? Because, says the\r\n    objector, vested rights forbid it. But there can be no vested\r\n    rights against original and natural rights. No claim of a part of\r\n    the human family to the while earth can be valid against the claim\r\n    of the whole human family to it. No passing of papers or\r\n    parchments in former generations can foreclose the rights of the\r\n    present generation. No bargains and no conventional titles can\r\n    avail in justice against the great title-deeds, by which Nature\r\n    grants and conveys herself to each generation, as it comes upon\r\n    the earth; and by which she makes the living (simply because they\r\n    are the living, and not at all because of their relation to the\r\n    dead) the equal owners of her soil and seas, her light and air. No\r\n    arrangements, by which the six thousand, who have monopolized the\r\n    lands of Ireland, should be allowed to overcome the title of the\r\n    six millions to it. If the natural and inherent right of the whole\r\n    is not paramount to that, which the fractions claim to have\r\n    acquired, then are _the six millions born into the world\r\n    trespassers_; and then is the Creator chargeable with a lack of\r\n    wisdom and goodness. If it is right that the mass of men should\r\n    hold their standing-place on the earth by mere sufferance, or upon\r\n    terms dictated by their fellows, then is it not true that God is\r\n    an Impartial Father--for then it is not true that he has given the\r\n    earth to all his children, but only to a select.\"\r\n\r\nWe, too, think Free Society a very bad thing, and a decided failure, but\r\nnot half so bad as Mr. Smith paints it. There is a poor-house system in\r\nIreland, which, to some extent, recognizes the doctrine that all men are\r\nentitled to live on the earth, and be supported from it. In practice,\r\nthe system does not always work well; yet we are confident it works much\r\nbetter for all parties, than would Mr. Smith's plan of agrarianism.\r\n\r\nBut slavery does, in practice as well as in theory, acknowledge and\r\nenforce the right of all to be comfortably supported from the soil.\r\nThere was, we repeat, no pauperism in Europe till feudal slavery was\r\nabolished.\r\n\r\nIt will be strange, indeed, if the voters in New York, a majority of\r\nwhom own no land, do not take Mr. Smith at his word, and assert their\r\nsuperior claim, under his Higher Law and \"Fundamental Principles,\" to\r\nall the land. 'Tis a concise and ingenious syllogism, to this effect:\r\n\"The earth belongs equally to all mankind, under the Higher Law, or Law\r\nof God, which is superior to all human laws; therefore, the lackland\r\nmajority have a better right to the soil than the present proprietors,\r\nwhose title is derived from mere human law.\"\r\n\r\nIt never did occur to us, that the paupers had the best right to all the\r\nfarms, until we saw this new application of the Higher Law. But 'tis\r\nclear as noon-day, if you grant the Higher Law, as expounded by Mr.\r\nSeward; and we expect soon to hear that they are bringing their titles\r\ninto court. Anti-rentism looked this way, and anti-rentism chose its own\r\nGovernor and Judges.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Garrison outbids Mr. Smith all hollow for the pauper vote. He\r\npromises not only to every one his \"vine and fig-tree,\" but a vine and\r\nfig-tree that will bear fruit without culture. He is going to get up a\r\nterrestrial paradise, in which there will be no jails, no taxes, no\r\nlabor, no want, no sickness, no pain, no government--in fact, no\r\nanything. But he shall speak for himself. We find the following in the\r\n_Liberator_ of 1st August:\r\n\r\n    \"Indeed, properly speaking, there is but one government, and that\r\n    is not human, but divine; there is but one law, and that is 'the\r\n    Higher Law;' there is but one ruler, and that one is God, 'in whom\r\n    we live and move, and have our being.' What is called human\r\n    government is usurpation, imposture, demagoguism, peculation,\r\n    swindling, and tyranny, more or less, according to circumstances,\r\n    and to the intellectual and moral condition of the people.\r\n    Unquestionably, every existing government on earth is to be\r\n    overthrown by the growth of mind and moral regeneration of the\r\n    masses. Absolutism, limited monarchy, democracy--all are sustained\r\n    by the sword; all are based upon the doctrine, that 'Might makes\r\n    right;' all are intrinsically inhuman, selfish, clannish, and\r\n    opposed to a recognition of the brotherhood of man. They are to\r\n    liberty, what whiskey, brandy and gin are to temperance. They\r\n    belong to the 'Kingdoms of this World,' and in due time are to be\r\n    destroyed by the Brightness of the coming of Him, 'whose right it\r\n    is to reign;' and by the erection of a Kingdom which cannot be\r\n    shaken. They are not for the people, but make the people their\r\n    prey; they are hostile to all progress; they resist to the utmost\r\n    all radical changes. All history shows that Liberty, Humanity,\r\n    Justice and Right have ever been in conflict with existing\r\n    governments, no matter what their theory or form.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Greely's Phalansteries, Mr. Andrews' Free Love, Mr. Goodell's\r\nMillenium, and Mr. Smith's Agrarianism, all pale before this Kingdom of\r\nMr. Garrison's. He is King of the Abolitionists, Great Anarch of the\r\nNorth.\r\n\r\nWe cannot reconcile this millennial doctrine of Mr. Garrison's with\r\nanother doctrine, which we have seen imputed to him in the _Richmond\r\nExaminer_, to wit, that there is no God, because no beneficent Creator\r\nwould have so constituted mankind as to have made slavery almost\r\nuniversal. Now, assume, as he does, that slavery is a cruel, sinful and\r\nwicked institution, destructive alike of human happiness and well-being,\r\nand his conclusion is irresistible. To be consistent, all anti-slavery\r\nmen should be atheists. Ere long, we suspect, their consistency will\r\nequal their folly and profanity.\r\n\r\nWith us, who think slavery a benevolent institution, equally necessary\r\nto protect the weak, and to govern the wicked and the ignorant, its\r\nprevalence is part of that order and adaptation of the universe that\r\n\"lifts the soul from Nature up to Nature's God.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nIN WHAT ANTI-SLAVERY ENDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Carlyle very properly contends that abolition and all the other\r\nsocial movements of the day, propose little or no government as the\r\nmoral panacea that is to heal and save a suffering world. Proudhon\r\nexpressly advocates anarchy; and Stephen Pearl Andrews, the ablest of\r\nAmerican socialistic and abolition philosophers, elaborately attacks all\r\nexisting social relations, and all legal and governmental restraints,\r\nand proposes No-Government as their substitute. He is the author of the\r\nFree Love experiment in New York, and a co-laborer and eulogist of\r\nsimilar experiments in villages or settlements in Ohio, Long Island and\r\nother places in the North and Northwest. He is a follower of Josiah\r\nWarren, who was associated with Owen of Lanark at New Harmony. We do not\r\nknow that there is any essential difference between his system and that\r\nwhich has been for many years past practically carried out in Oneida\r\ncounty, New York, by the Perfectionists, who construe the Bible into\r\nauthority for the unrestrained indulgence of every sensual appetite. The\r\ndoctrines of Fourier, of Owen and Fanny Wright, and the other early\r\nSocialists, all lead to No-Government and Free Love. 'Tis probable they\r\nforesaw and intended this result, but did not suggest or propose it to a\r\nworld then too wicked and unenlightened to appreciate its beatific\r\npurity and loveliness. The materials, as well as the proceedings of the\r\ninfidel, woman's rights, negro's rights, free-every thing and anti-every\r\nschool, headed and conducted in Boston, by Garrison, Parker, Phillips,\r\nand their associate women and negroes, show that they too are busy with\r\n\"assiduous wedges\" in loosening the whole frame of society, and\r\npreparing for the glorious advent of Free Love and No-Government. All\r\nthe Infidel and Abolition papers in the North betray a similar tendency.\r\nThe Abolitionists of New York, headed by Gerrit Smith and Wm. Goodell,\r\nare engaged in precisely the same projects, but being Christians, would\r\ndignify Free Love and No-Government with the appellation of a Millenium.\r\nProbably half the Abolitionists at the North expect a great social\r\nrevolution soon to occur by the advent of the Millenium. If they would\r\npatiently await that event, instead of attempting to get it up\r\nthemselves, their delusions, however ridiculous, might at least be\r\ninnocuous. But these progressive Christian Socialists differ not at all\r\nfrom the Infidel Socialists of Boston. They are equally intent and busy\r\nin pulling down the priesthood, and abolishing or dividing all\r\nproperty--seeing that whether the denouement be Free Love or a\r\nMillenium, the destruction of all existing human relations and human\r\ninstitutions is pre-requisite to their full fruition.\r\n\r\nMany thousand as have been of late years the social experiments\r\nattempting to practice community of property, of wives, children, &c.,\r\nand numerous as the books inculcating and approving such practices, yet\r\nthe existence and growth of Mormonism is of itself stronger evidence\r\nthan all other of the tendency of modern free society towards\r\nNo-Government and Free Love. In the name of polygamy, it has practically\r\nremoved all restraints to the intercourse of sexes, and broken up the\r\nFamily. It promises, too, a qualified community of property and a\r\nfraternal association of labor. It beats up monthly thousands of\r\nrecruits from free society in Europe and America, but makes not one\r\nconvert in the slaveholding South. Slavery is satisfied and\r\nconservative. Abolition, finding that all existing legal, religious,\r\nsocial and governmental institutions restrict liberty and occasion a\r\nquasi slavery, is resolved not to stop short of the subversion of all\r\nthose institutions, and the inauguration of Free Love and No-Government.\r\nThe only cure for all this is for free society sternly to recognize\r\nslavery as right in principle, and necessary in practice, with more or\r\nless of modification, to the very existence of government, of property,\r\nof religion, and of social existence.\r\n\r\nWe shall not attempt to reconcile the doctrines of the Socialists, which\r\npropose to remove all legal restraints, with their denunciations of\r\nPolitical Economy. Let Alone is the essence of Political Economy and the\r\nwhole creed of most of the Socialists. The Political Economists, Let\r\nAlone, for a fair fight, for universal rivalry, antagonism, competition\r\nand cannibalism. They say, the eating up the weaker members of society,\r\nthe killing them out by capital and competition, will improve the breed\r\nof men and benefit society. They foresee the consequences of their\r\ndoctrine, and are consistent. Hobbes saw men devouring one another,\r\nunder their system, two hundred years ago, and we all see them similarly\r\nengaged now. The Socialists promise that when society is wholly\r\ndisintegrated and dissolved, by inculcating good principles and \"singing\r\nfraternity over it,\" all men will co-operate, love, and help one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThey place men in positions of equality, rivalry, and antagonism, which\r\nmust result in extreme selfishness of conduct, and yet propose this\r\nsystem as a cure for selfishness. To us their reasonings seem absurd.\r\n\r\nYet the doctrines so prevalent with Abolitionists and Socialists, of\r\nFree Love and Free Lands, Free Churches, Free Women and Free\r\nNegroes--of No-Marriage, No-Religion, No-Private Property, No-Law and\r\nNo-Government, are legitimate deductions, if not obvious corollaries\r\nfrom the leading and distinctive axiom of political economy--Laissez\r\nFaire, or let alone.\r\n\r\nAll the leading Socialists and Abolitionists of the North, we think,\r\nagree with Fanny Wright, that the gradual changes which have taken place\r\nin social organization from domestic slavery to praedial serfdom and\r\nthence to the present system of free and competitive society, have been\r\nmere transitive states, each placing the laborer in a worse condition\r\nthan that of absolute slavery, yet valuable as preparing the way for a\r\nnew and more perfect social state. They value the present state of\r\nsociety the more highly because it is intolerable, and must the sooner\r\nusher in a Millenium or Utopia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nCHRISTIAN MORALITY IMPRACTICABLE IN FREE SOCIETY--BUT THE NATURAL\r\nMORALITY OF SLAVE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is strange that theories, self-evidently true so soon as suggested,\r\nremain undiscovered for centuries. What more evident, obvious, and\r\naxiomatic, than that equals must from necessity be rivals, antagonists,\r\ncompetitors, and enemies. Self-preservation, the first law of human and\r\nanimal nature, makes this selfish course of action essential to preserve\r\nexistence. It is almost equally obvious, that in the natural, social, or\r\nfamily state, unselfishness, or the preference of others' good and\r\nhappiness, is the dictate of nature and policy. Nature impels the father\r\nand husband to self-abnegation and self-denial to promote the happiness\r\nof wife and children, because his reflected enjoyments will be a\r\nthousand times greater than any direct pleasure he can derive by\r\nstinting or maltreating them. Their misery and their complaints do much\r\nmore to render him wretched than what he has denied them can compensate\r\nfor. Wife and children, too, see and feel that in denying themselves and\r\npromoting the happiness of the head of the family, they pursue true\r\npolicy, and are most sensibly selfish when they seem most unselfish.\r\nEspecially, however, is it true with slaves and masters, that to \"do as\r\nthey would be done by\" is mutually beneficial. Good treatment and proper\r\ndiscipline renders the slave happier, healthier, more valuable,\r\ngrateful, and contented. Obedience, industry and loyalty on the part of\r\nthe slave, increases the master's ability and disposition to protect and\r\ntake care of him. The interests of all the members of a natural family,\r\nslaves included, are identical. Selfishness finds no place, because\r\nnature, common feelings and self-interest dictate to all that it is\r\ntheir true interest \"to love their neighbor as themselves,\" and \"to do\r\nas they would be done by,\"--at least, within the precincts of the\r\nfamily. To throw off into the world wife, children, and slaves, would\r\ninjure, not benefit them. To neglect to punish children or slaves when\r\nthey deserved it, would not be to do as we would be done by. Such\r\npunishment is generally the highest reach of self-abnegation and\r\nself-control. 'Tis easy and agreeable to be indulgent and remiss--hard\r\nto exact and enforce duty. Severe disciplinarians are the best officers,\r\nteachers, parents, and masters, and most revered and loved by their\r\nsubordinates. They sacrifice their time and their feelings to duty, and\r\nfor the ultimate good of others. Easy, lax, indulgent men are generally\r\nselfish and sensual, and justly forfeit the respect and affection of\r\nthose whom they neglect to punish, because to do so would disturb their\r\nEpicurean repose. Christian morality is neither difficult nor unnatural\r\nwhere dependent, family, and slave relations exist, and Christian\r\nmorality was preached and only intended for such.\r\n\r\nThe whole morale of free society is, \"Every man, woman and child for\r\nhimself and herself.\" Slavery in every form must be abolished. Wives\r\nmust have distinct, separate, and therefore antagonistic and conflicting\r\ninterests from their husbands, and children must as soon as possible be\r\nremitted to the rights of manhood. Is it not passing strange, wonderful,\r\nthat such men as Channing and Wayland did not see that their world of\r\nuniversal liberty was a world of universal selfishness, discord,\r\ncompetition, rivalry, and war of the wits. Hobbes did see it, and\r\nsupposing there was no other world, said \"a state of nature was a state\r\nof war.\" But the family, including slaves, which the Abolitionists would\r\ndestroy, has been almost universal, and is therefore natural. Christian\r\nmorality is the natural morality in slave society, and slave society is\r\nthe only natural society. Such society as that of the early Patriarchs\r\nof Judea, under Moses and Joshua, and as that of the South, would never\r\nbeget a sceptic, a Hobbes, a Wayland, nor a Channing. In such society it\r\nis natural for men to love one another. The ordinary relations of men\r\nare not competitive and antagonistic as in free society; and selfishness\r\nis not general, but exceptionable. Duty to self is the first of duties:\r\nfree society makes it the only duty. Man is not naturally selfish or\r\nbad, for he is naturally social. Free society dissociates him, and makes\r\nhim bad and selfish from necessity.\r\n\r\nIt is said in Scripture, that it is harder for a rich man to enter the\r\nkingdom of heaven than for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle.\r\nWe are no theologian; but do know from history and observation that\r\nwealthy men who are sincere and devout Christians in free society, feel\r\nat a loss what to do with their wealth, so as not to make it an\r\ninstrument of oppression and wrong. Capital and skill are powers\r\nexercised almost always to oppress labor. If you endow colleges, you\r\nrear up cunning, voracious exploitators to devour the poor. If you give\r\nit to tradesmen or land owners, 'tis still an additional instrument,\r\nalways employed to oppress laborers. If you give it to the really needy,\r\nyou too often encourage idleness, and increase the burdens of the\r\nworking poor who support every body: We cannot possibly see but one safe\r\nway to invest wealth, and that is to buy slaves with it, whose conduct\r\nyou can control, and be sure that your charity is not misapplied, and\r\nmischievous.\r\n\r\nIs there any other safe way of investing wealth, or bestowing charity?\r\nWe regret that delicacy restrains us from putting the question to a\r\ncelebrated, wealthy philanthropist of the North, who is candid, bold,\r\nexperienced, and an Abolitionist to boot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nSLAVERY--ITS EFFECTS ON THE FREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeaten at every other quarter, we learn that a distinguished writer at\r\nthe North, is about to be put forward by the Abolitionists, to prove\r\nthat the influence of slavery is deleterious on the whites who own no\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nNow, at first view it elevates those whites; for it makes them not the\r\nbottom of society, as at the North--not the menials, the hired day\r\nlaborer, the work scavengers and scullions--but privileged citizens,\r\nlike Greek and Roman citizens, with a numerous class far beneath them.\r\nIn slave society, one white man does not lord it over another; for all\r\nare equal in privilege, if not in wealth; and the poorest would not\r\nbecome a menial--hold your horse, and then extend his hand or his hat\r\nfor a gratuity, were you to proffer him the wealth of the Indies. The\r\nmenial, the exposed and laborious, and the disgraceful occupations, are\r\nall filled by slaves. But filled they must be by some one, and in free\r\nsociety, half of its members are employed in occupations that are not\r\nconsidered or treated as respectable. Our slaves till the land, do the\r\ncoarse and hard labor on our roads and canals, sweep our streets, cook\r\nour food, brush our boots, wait on our tables, hold our horses, do all\r\nhard work, and fill all menial offices. Your freemen at the North do the\r\nsame work and fill the same offices. The only difference is, we love our\r\nslaves, and we are ready to defend, assist and protect them; you hate\r\nand fear your white servants, and never fail, as a moral duty, to screw\r\ndown their wages to the lowest, and to starve their families, if\r\npossible, as evidence of your thrift, economy and management--the only\r\nEnglish and Yankee virtues.\r\n\r\nIn free society, miscalled freemen fulfill all the offices of slaves for\r\nless wages than slaves, and are infinitely less liked and cared for by\r\ntheir superiors than slaves. Does this elevate them and render them\r\nhappy?\r\n\r\nThe trades, the professions, the occupations that pay well, and whose\r\nwork is light, is reserved for freemen in slave society. Does this\r\ndepress them?\r\n\r\nThe doctor, the lawyer, the mechanic, the dentist, the merchant, the\r\noverseer, every trade and profession, in fact, live from the proceeds of\r\nslave labor at the South. They divide the profits with the owner of the\r\nslaves. He has nothing to pay them except what his slaves make. But you\r\nYankees and Englishmen more than divide the profits--you take the lion's\r\nshare. You make more money from our cotton, and tobacco, and sugar, and\r\nindigo, and wheat, and corn, and rice, than we make ourselves. You live\r\nby slave labor--would perish without it--yet you abuse it. Cut off\r\nEngland and New England from the South American, East and West India and\r\nour markets, from which to buy their food, and in which to sell their\r\nmanufactures, and they would starve at once. You live by our slave\r\nlabor. It elevates your whites as well as ours, by confining them, in a\r\ngreat degree, to skillful, well-paying, light and intellectual\r\nemployments--and it feeds and clothes them. Abolish slavery, and you\r\nwill suffer vastly more than we, because we have all the lands of the\r\nSouth, and can _command_ labor as you do, and a genial soil and climate,\r\nthat require less labor. But while in the absence of slavery, we could\r\nsupport ourselves, we should cease to support you. We would neither send\r\nyou food and clothing, nor buy your worse than useless notions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nPRIVATE PROPERTY DESTROYS LIBERTY AND EQUALITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists and Socialists, who, alone, have explored the recesses\r\nof social science, well understand that they can never establish their\r\nUtopia until private property is abolished or equalized. The man without\r\nproperty is theoretically, and, too often, practically, without a single\r\nright. Air and water, 'tis generally believed, are the common property\r\nof mankind; but nothing is falser in fact as well as theory. The\r\nownership of land gives to the proprietor the exclusive right to every\r\nthing above and beneath the soil. The lands are all appropriated, and\r\nwith them the air above them, the waters on them, and the mines beneath\r\nthem. The pauper, to breathe the air or drink the waters, must first\r\nfind a place where he may rightfully enjoy them. He can find, at all\r\ntimes, no such place, and is compelled, by his necessities, to inhale\r\nthe close and putrid air of small rooms, damp cellars and crowded\r\nfactories, and to drink insufficient quantities of impure water,\r\nfurnished to him at a price he can ill afford. He pays for the water\r\nwhich he drinks, because it has ceased to be common property. He is not\r\nfree, because he has no where that he may rightfully lay his head.\r\nPrivate property has monopolized the earth, and destroyed both his\r\nliberty and equality. He has no security for his life, for he cannot\r\nlive without employment and adequate wages, and none are bound to employ\r\nhim. If the earth were in common, he could always enjoy not only air and\r\nwater, but by his industry might earn the means of subsistence. His\r\nsituation is theoretically and practically desperate and intolerable.\r\nWere he a slave, he would enjoy in fact as well as in legal fiction, all\r\nnecessary and essential rights. Pure air and water, a house, sufficient\r\nfood, fire, and clothing, would be his at all times. Slavery is a form\r\nof communism, and as the Abolitionists and Socialists have resolved to\r\nadopt a new social system, we recommend it to their consideration. The\r\nmanner in which the change shall be made from the present form of\r\nsociety to that system of communism which we propose is very simple.\r\nNegro slaves are now worth seven hundred dollars a-head. As whites work\r\nharder, they are worth about a thousand. Make the man who owns a\r\nthousand dollars of capital the guardian (the term master is\r\nobjectionable) of one white pauper of average value; give the man who\r\nis worth ten thousand dollars ten paupers, and the millionaire a\r\nthousand. This would be an act of simple mercy and justice; for the\r\ncapitalists now live entirely by the proceeds of poor men's labor, which\r\ncapital enables them to command; and they command and enjoy it in almost\r\nthe exact proportions which we have designated. Thus, a family of poor\r\nlaborers, men, women and children, ten in number, can support\r\nthemselves, and make about six hundred dollars, for their employer,\r\nwhich is the interest on ten thousand. They would work no harder than\r\nthey do now, would be under no greater necessity to work, would be\r\nrelieved of most of the cares of life, and let into the enjoyment of all\r\nvaluable and necessary rights. What would they lose in liberty and\r\nequality? Just nothing. Having more rights, they would have more liberty\r\nthan now, and approach nearer to equality. It might be, that their\r\nsecurity and exemption from care would render their situation preferable\r\nto that of their employers. We suspect it would be easier to find wards\r\nor slaves than guardians or masters--for the gain would be all on the\r\nlaborer's side, and the loss all on that of the capitalist.\r\n\r\nSet your miscalled free laborers actually free, by giving them enough\r\nproperty or capital to live on, and then call on us at the South to free\r\nour negroes. At present, you Abolitionists know our negro slaves are\r\nmuch the freer of the two; and it would be a great advance towards\r\nfreeing your laborers, to give them guardians, bound, like our masters,\r\nto take care of them, and entitled, in consideration thereof, to the\r\nproceeds of their labor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ERA AN EXCELLENT WITNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an article in the _Era_ of August 16, 1855, criticising and denying\r\nour theory of the Failure of Free Society, the writer begins by\r\nasserting, \"We demonstrated, last week, from history, that the condition\r\nof the poor of England has greatly improved in modern times, as they\r\nhave become free from the restraints of feudal bondage.\" He then goes on\r\nto criticise us, but, before concluding, contradicts and refutes his\r\nwork of the week before, and adopts our theory in its fullest extent. He\r\nadmits the intolerable exploitation and oppression of capital over\r\nlabor, but looks forward to the day when it will be corrected. He is,\r\nlike all Abolitionists, agrarian. He holds our doctrine, too, that the\r\nserfs were set free to starve, not because liberty was a good or a boon.\r\nHe further holds, that the poor laborers could not get masters if they\r\nwanted them, because the rich can get their labor on better terms. Thus\r\nhe distinctly shows that Free Society has failed, and why it has failed.\r\nWe know very well the rich of Western Europe would not willingly take\r\nthe poor as slaves, but the law should compel them to do so; for that\r\nis the only feasible system of agrarianism, the only practicable way of\r\nletting in all men to a sufficient, if not equal, enjoyment of terra\r\nmater. Here is his refutation of himself, and confirmation of our\r\ntheory, which he thinks he is upsetting. We never take up an abolition\r\npaper without finding doctrines like those of the _Era_, and only adduce\r\nit as a specimen:\r\n\r\n    \"Under despotic and corrupt governments, which oppress the people\r\n    with taxes, to support extravagant misrule and unnecessary\r\n    war--which debauch them by evil example of those in high places,\r\n    and discourage education or render it impossible--the condition of\r\n    the poor and nominally free becomes truly deplorable. But it is\r\n    not Freedom which is their undoing--it is rather the lack of it.\r\n    It is their subjection, through ignorance, to bad rulers, which\r\n    keeps them in poverty. We know that the claim laid by capital to\r\n    the lion's share of profits is itself, under any circumstances, a\r\n    great obstruction to the progress of the masses; but we believe\r\n    that even that obstacle will one day be removed--that problem in\r\n    political science be solved by civilization and Christianity. We\r\n    believe that the human intellect will never, with the light of the\r\n    Gospel to guide and inspire its efforts, surrender to the cold and\r\n    heartless reign of capital over labor. But, at any rate, one thing\r\n    is certain, under the worst form of government, or the best,\r\n    namely: when Freedom becomes a burden and a curse to the poor,\r\n    Slavery--that is to say, the enslavement of the mass of laborers,\r\n    with responsibility on the part of the master for their\r\n    support--is no longer possible. When freemen are unable to\r\n    support, themselves, among all the diversified employments of free\r\n    societies, it would be impossible for them to find masters willing\r\n    to take the responsibility. The masses in Europe, in fact, owe\r\n    their liberty to the excessive supply of slave labor, which, when\r\n    it becomes a burden to the land, was cast aside as worthless. Who\r\n    believes that Irish landlords would take the responsibility of\r\n    supporting the peasantry, on the condition of their becoming\r\n    slaves? In fact, is it not notorious that they help them to\r\n    emigrate to America, and often pull down their cabins and huts, in\r\n    order to drive them off?\"\r\n\r\nIn further proof of the agrarian doctrines of the Abolitionists, we add\r\nan article from the _Northern Christian Advocate_, a clever Methodist\r\npaper, edited in the State of New York:\r\n\r\n    \"FACTORY OPERATIVES.--There is a class of laborers, consisting of\r\n    men, women and children, whom we never contemplate but with\r\n    regret--we see them, at least, in imagination, subsiding, in spite\r\n    of all their care, into utter dependence and poverty. Hence, we\r\n    never look upon a factory or large manufacturing establishment\r\n    with unmingled pleasure. The men and women, who ply its machinery,\r\n    are too apt to become identified with such establishments in an\r\n    improper degree. This process of assimilation and identification\r\n    goes on slowly, but surely, till at last the individual and the\r\n    factory are so blended into one, that a separate existence is\r\n    impossible. One or two generations are required to bring about\r\n    this state of things. Pecuniary dependence, ignorance of other\r\n    employments, physical malformation, and the general helplessness\r\n    of a mere factory population, are not the work of a day.\r\n    Individuals cannot be detached from other pursuits at once--cannot\r\n    have manufacturing knowledge and no other knowledge until they\r\n    have had time to drift away from other occupations. But however\r\n    retarded the effect, it is sure to follow, and consequently every\r\n    large mechanical establishment must be considered as having\r\n    certain malign tendencies, which are to be carefully guarded\r\n    against.\r\n\r\n    \"The causes of the evil under consideration are very obvious, as\r\n    is also their appropriate remedy. We must set down as the first\r\n    and principal cause of injury, the fact that the capital which\r\n    sustains mechanical business is not under the control of the\r\n    operatives. The mills or machines may stop at any hour in spite of\r\n    the wants or wishes of the employees. Wages may be put down,\r\n    little or much, with or without notice. Operatives are not\r\n    consulted in such cases. The motive may be good or bad--it may be\r\n    to guard against bankruptcy, or to amass wealth from the sinews of\r\n    a toiling, dependent race. But, whatever the motive and the\r\n    decision, the operative is helpless--he can control neither the\r\n    one nor the other. It is his to labor; others are charged with the\r\n    regulation of prices, and the only check in his power is the\r\n    precarious one of a _strike_. Strikes in business are like\r\n    insurrections in civil governments--a last, desperate remedy, and\r\n    as often fatal to the sufferer as protective of his interests.\r\n    The same is true of the farmer who does not own the soil on which\r\n    he labors, but is compelled to make terms with a landlord. Hence,\r\n    the well known insurmountable evils of agricultural tenantry. In\r\n    Europe it has produced serfdom and feudalism, besides a good deal\r\n    of servitude and degradation concealed under the mild name of\r\n    peasant. It matters not what the occupation may be, as soon as the\r\n    laborer becomes thoroughly dependent, and feels that dependence,\r\n    the system does him an incalculable injury. It is for this reason\r\n    that large landholders always deteriorate the population, and\r\n    society becomes worthless just in proportion as the means of\r\n    independent existence pass from the hands of the many to the few.\r\n    This difficulty is, and must be forever in the way of conducting\r\n    manufacturing establishments on the present plan. Perhaps some\r\n    means of diffusing capital among operatives, or, what is the same,\r\n    of giving the laborer reasonable securities, may yet be\r\n    discovered; but the change would require to be radical. The\r\n    monopoly of capital, is so nearly like the monopoly of land, that\r\n    we may readily see no partial measures can ever effect a cure.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF THE ISMS--SHEWING WHY THEY ABOUND AT THE NORTH, AND\r\nARE UNKNOWN AT THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe exploitation, or unjust exactions of skill and capital in free\r\nsociety, excite the learned and philanthropic to devise schemes of\r\nescape, and impel the laborers to adopt those schemes, however\r\nchimerical, because they feel that their situation cannot be worsted.\r\nThey are already slaves without masters, and that is the bathos of human\r\nmisery. Besides, universal liberty has disintegrated and dissolved\r\nsociety, and placed men in isolated, selfish, and antagonistic\r\npositions--in which each man is compelled to wrong others, in order to\r\nbe just to himself. But man's nature is social, not selfish, and he\r\nlongs and yearns to return to parental, fraternal and associative\r\nrelations. All the isms concur in promising closer and more associative\r\nrelations, in establishing at least a qualified community of property,\r\nand in insuring the weak and unfortunate the necessaries and comforts of\r\nlife. Indeed, they all promise to establish slavery--minus, the master\r\nand the overseer. As the evils which we have described are little felt\r\nat the South, men here would as soon think of entering the lion's cage,\r\nas going into one of their incestuous establishments. Mormonism is only\r\na monster development of the isms. They are all essentially alike, and\r\nthat the most successful, because, so far, it has been socialism--plus\r\nthe overseer. The mantle of Joe Smith descended on Brigham Young, and if\r\nhe transmit to a true prophet, there is no telling how long the thing\r\nmay work. Mormonism had its birth in Western New York, that land fertile\r\nof isms--where also arose Spiritual Rappings and Oneida\r\nPerfectionism--where Shakers, and Millenarians, and Millerites abound,\r\nand all heresies do most flourish. Mormonism now is daily gathering\r\nthousands of recruits from free society in Europe, Asia, Africa, and our\r\nNorth, and not one from the South. It has no religion, but in place of\r\nit, a sensual moral code, that shocks the common sense of propriety. But\r\nit holds property somewhat in common, draws men together in closer and\r\nmore fraternal relations, and promises (probably falsely) a safe retreat\r\nand refuge from the isolated and inimical relations, the killing\r\ncompetition and exploitation, of free society. All the other isms do the\r\nsame--but mal-administration, or the want of a master, soon explodes\r\nthem. We saw last year an advertisement, under the hammer, of the last\r\nof fourteen phalansteries, established at the North on the\r\nGreely-Fourierite plan. The Shakers do better; but Mr. S. P. Andrews,\r\nwho is an expert, informs us that they, like the Mormons, have a\r\ndespotic head. Socialism, with such despotic head, approaches very near\r\nto Southern slavery, and gets along very well so long as the despot\r\nlives. Mr. S. P. Andrews should enlighten the public as to the progress\r\nof the Free Love villages of Trialville, in Ohio, Modern Zion, on Long\r\nIsland, &c. \"Self-elected despotism\" is his theory of the perfection of\r\nsociety. Has any Cromwell, or Napoleon, or Joe Smith, seized the sceptre\r\nin those delightful villages, which we hope will soon inspire the pen of\r\nsome Northern Bocaccio. Human opinion advances in concentric circles.\r\nAbolition swallows up the little isms, and Socialism swallows up\r\nAbolition. Socialism long since attained the point of the circle most\r\ndistant from slavery, and is now rapidly coming round to the point\r\nwhence it started--that is, to slavery. Mr. Andrews, who is no humbug,\r\n(except in so far as any philosopher is a humbug,) Mr. Andrews, who is\r\nprobably the foremost thinker in America, could, if he would, prove to\r\nthe Abolitionists and Socialists, that after a furious day's drive, like\r\nthat of Toby Lumpkin and his mother, they are just about to haul up at\r\nthe horse pond, in a few yards of the place where they started in the\r\nmorning. The Socialists, Louis Napoleon included, are trying to\r\nestablish slavery, whilst abusing the word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nDEFICIENCY OF FOOD IN FREE SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe normal state of free society is a state of famine. Agricultural\r\nlabor is the most arduous, least respectable, and worst paid of all\r\nlabor. Nature and philosophy teach all who can to avoid and escape from\r\nit, and to pursue less laborious, more respectable, and more lucrative\r\nemployments. None work in the field who can help it. Hence free society\r\nis in great measure dependent for its food and clothing on slave\r\nsociety. Western Europe and New England get their cotton, sugar, and\r\nmuch of their bread and meat from the South, from Cuba, Russia, Poland\r\nand Turkey. After all, the mass of their population suffers continual\r\nphysical want. McCulloch informs us in his edition of Adam Smith, \"that\r\nthe better sort of Irish laborers eat meat once a month, or once in six\r\nmonths; the lowest order never. The better class of English laborers eat\r\nmeat twice or three times a week.\" Now no Southern negro would believe\r\nthis if you were to swear to it. Yet it is a very favorable account of\r\nthose laborers. The Irish rarely eat bread, and the English peasantry\r\nhave wholly inadequate allowance of it. On the Continent, the peasantry\r\ngenerally live on fruits, nuts and olives, and other things, which our\r\nslaves do not seek as food at all, but as mere condiments to give a\r\nrelish to their meat and bread. Agriculture is the proper pursuit of\r\nslaves, to be superintended and directed, however, by freemen. Its\r\nprofits are inadequate to the support of separate families of laborers,\r\nespecially of white laborers in cold climates, whose wants are greater\r\nthan those of negroes at the South. The expenses of families are greatly\r\nlessened where slavery associates a large number under a common head, or\r\nmaster, and their labor is rendered more efficient and productive.\r\n\r\nThis is the great idea of the Socialists, and it is a truer one than the\r\n\"every-man-for-himself\" doctrine of the political economists. Free\r\nsociety is in great measure fed and clothed by slave society, which it\r\npays for in worthless baubles, fashionable trifles, and deleterious\r\nluxuries;--without which, slave society would do much better. Every one\r\nshould study the census of the Union, in order to see how dependent the\r\nNorth-east is on slave labor, and how trifling are her agricultural\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nThe profits of slave farming enure chiefly to the advantage of Western\r\nEurope and our North. Practical men, therefore, at the North, so far\r\nfrom going to work to abolish slavery, are bringing daily a larger\r\nsupply of slaves into the slave market, than ever was brought before.\r\nAdd the Coolies of Asia and apprentices from Africa to the old negro\r\nslave trade, and the annual supply of new slaves exceeds by far that of\r\nany other period.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists will probably succeed in dissolving the Union, in\r\ninvolving us in civil and fratricidal war, and in cutting off the North\r\nfrom its necessary supply of food and clothing; but they should\r\nrecollect that whilst they are engaged in this labor of love, Northern\r\nand English merchants are rapidly extending and increasing slavery, by\r\nopening daily new markets for the purchase and sale of Coolies,\r\napprentices and Africans.\r\n\r\nThe foreign slave trade is not necessary for the supply of the slave\r\nmarkets. The increase of the present slaves, if humanely treated, would\r\nsuffice to meet that demand. But Africans and Coolies cost less than the\r\nrearing of slaves in America, and the trade in them, whenever carried\r\non, induces masters to work their old slaves to death and buy new ones\r\nfrom abroad.\r\n\r\nThe foreign slave trade, especially the Cooley trade, is the most\r\ninhuman pursuit in which man ever engaged. Equally inhuman to the\r\nvictims which it imports, and to the old slaves, whose treatment and\r\ncondition it renders intolerably cruel. By directing philanthropy and\r\npublic opinion in a false direction, the Abolitionists have become the\r\nmost efficient propagandists of slavery and the slave trade. And\r\nslavery, such as it exists in pursuance of the foreign slave trade,\r\nshocks our sense of humanity quite as much as that of the most sensitive\r\nAbolitionists.\r\n\r\nSince writing thus far, we met with the following in the Charleston\r\nMercury:\r\n\r\n    \"WHEAT IN MASSACHUSETTS.--The deficiency in the production of\r\n    wheat in Massachusetts alone, in 1855, for the consumption of her\r\n    inhabitants, was 3,915,550 bushels; and of Indian corn, 3,420,675\r\n    bushels, (_without allowing any thing for the consumption of corn\r\n    by cattle_.)\r\n\r\n    \"In 1850, the deficiency in the production of wheat in all the New\r\n    England States, was equal to 1,691,502 barrels of flour; and to\r\n    3,464,675 bushels of corn, (_without allowing any thing for the\r\n    consumption by cattle_.)\r\n\r\n    \"This is 327,185 barrels more than was exported of domestic flour\r\n    from all of the United States to foreign countries during the year\r\n    ending 30th June, 1855, and 87,000 more barrels than was exported\r\n    both of domestic and foreign flour from the United States for the\r\n    same period.\"\r\n\r\nWe conclude, from our examination of the census, that the grain and\r\npotatoes made in New England would about feed her cattle, horses, hogs\r\nand sheep--leaving none for her inhabitants. We lately compared\r\ncarefully the census of Massachusetts and North Carolina, and found, in\r\nround numbers, that according to population, North Carolina produced\r\nannually ten times as much of human food as Massachusetts,--but that\r\nMassachusetts balanced the account by producing annually ten times as\r\nmany paupers and criminals as North Carolina. We also discover that the\r\nwant of food in the one State and its abundance in the other, tells on\r\nthe duration of human life. The mortality in Massachusetts is nearly\r\ndouble that in North Carolina. We infer that there is ten times as much\r\nof human happiness in North Carolina as in Massachusetts. The census\r\ngives no account of the infidels and the isms--of them there are none in\r\nNorth Carolina, and Massachusetts may boast that she rivals Germany,\r\nFrance and Western New York in their production.\r\n\r\nReally, it is suicidal folly in New England to talk of disunion and\r\nsetting up for herself. She does not possess the elements of separate\r\nnationality. She is intelligent and wealthy; but her wealth is\r\ncosmopolitan--her poverty indigenous. Her commerce, her manufactures,\r\nand moneyed capital, constitute her wealth. Disunion would make these\r\nuseless and unprofitable at home, and they would be transferred\r\nimmediately to other States and Nations.\r\n\r\nNorth Carolina might well set up for herself, for she can produce all\r\nthe necessaries and comforts and luxuries of life within herself, and\r\nhas Virginia between herself and danger on the one side, and an\r\ninaccessible sea coast on the other. But we of Virginia, being a border\r\nState, would be badly situated in case of disunion, and mean to cling to\r\nit as long as honor permits. Besides, Virginia loves her nearest sister,\r\nPennsylvania, and cannot bear the thought of parting company with her.\r\n\r\n  Tecum vivere amem!\r\n  Tecum obeam lubens!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nMAN HAS PROPERTY IN MAN!\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Liberator of the 19th December, we observe that the editor\r\nnarrows down the slavery contest to the mere question, whether \"Man may\r\nrightfully hold property in man?\"\r\n\r\nWe think we can dispose of this objection to domestic slavery in a very\r\nfew words.\r\n\r\nMan is a social and gregarious animal, and all such animals hold\r\nproperty in each other. Nature imposes upon them slavery as a law and\r\nnecessity of their existence. They live together to aid each other, and\r\nare slaves under Mr. Garrison's higher law. Slavery arises under the\r\nhigher law, and is, and ever must be, coeval and coextensive with human\r\nnature.\r\n\r\nWe will enumerate a few of its ten thousand modifications.\r\n\r\nThe husband has a legally recognized property in his wife's services,\r\nand may legally control, in some measure, her personal liberty. She is\r\nhis property and his slave.\r\n\r\nThe wife has also a legally recognized property in the husband's\r\nservices. He is her property, but not her slave.\r\n\r\nThe father has property in the services and persons of his children till\r\nthey are twenty-one years of age. They are his property and his slaves.\r\n\r\nChildren have property, during infancy, in the services of each parent.\r\n\r\nInfant negroes, sick, infirm and superannuated negroes, hold most\r\nvaluable property in the services and capital of their masters. The\r\nmasters hold no property in such slaves, because, for the time, they are\r\nof no value.\r\n\r\nOwners and captains of vessels own property in the services of sailors,\r\nand may control their personal liberty. They (the sailors) are property,\r\nand slaves also.\r\n\r\nThe services and persons, lives and liberty of soldiers and of officers,\r\nbelong to the Government; they are, whilst in service, both property and\r\nslaves.\r\n\r\nEvery white working man, be he clerk, carpenter, mechanic, printer,\r\ncommon laborer, or what else, who contracts to serve for a term of days,\r\nmonths, or years, is, for such term, the property of his employer. He is\r\nnot a slave, like the wife, child, apprentice, sailor or soldier,\r\nbecause, although the employer's right to his services be equally\r\nperfect, his remedy to enforce such right is very different. In the one\r\ncase, he may resort to force to compel compliance; in the other, he is\r\ndriven to a suit for damages.\r\n\r\nAgain: Every capitalist holds property in his fellow men to the extent\r\nof the profits of his capital, or income. The only income possibly\r\nresulting from capital, is the result of the property which capital\r\nbestows on its owners, in the labor of other people. In our first three\r\nchapters we attempt to explain this.\r\n\r\nAll civilized society recognizes, and, in some measure, performs the\r\nobligation to support and provide for all human beings, whether natives\r\nor foreigners, who are unable to provide for themselves. Hence\r\npoor-houses, &c.\r\n\r\nHence all men hold valuable property, actual or contingent, in the\r\nservices of each other.\r\n\r\nIf, Mr. Garrison, this be the only difficulty to be adjusted between\r\nNorth and South, we are sure that your little pet, Disunion, \"living\r\nwill linger, and lingering will die.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Andrews and you have quite \"expelled human nature,\" dissolved\r\nand disintegrated society, and reduced mankind to separate, independent,\r\nbut conflicting monads, or human atoms--then, and not till then, will\r\nyou establish the 'sovereignty of the individual,' and destroy the\r\nproperty of man in man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nTHE \"COUP DE GRACE\" TO ABOLITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists are all willing to admit that free society has utterly\r\nfailed in Europe, but will assign two reasons for that failure--\"Excess\r\nof population, and want of equality and liberty.\"\r\n\r\nWere the population of England doubled, the labor required to support\r\nthat population would be lessened, could all labor and expenses be\r\nsupported alike; because the association and division of labor might be\r\nrendered more perfect, and the expenses of a single family, or single\r\nindividual, might be divided among and borne by many. The Socialists and\r\nAbolitionists understand this. When one family has to support its own\r\nschool, its own mill, its own mechanics, its own doctor, parson, &c.,\r\nliving is expensive; but where these and other expenses are divided\r\namong many, living becomes cheap; hence it is far less laborious to live\r\nin a densely settled country than in a sparsely settled one, if labor\r\nand expenses can be equally divided. The soil of England will readily\r\nsupport double its population, if its products be not wasted in luxury,\r\nin feeding deer, and game, and horses. England has not attained that\r\ndensity of population which enables men to live by the least amount of\r\nlabor. Her laboring population has been thinned and labor rendered\r\ndearer and scarcer, by emigration, of late years, to America, California\r\nand Australia--yet, in the winter of 1854, there was a general outbreak\r\nand riot of her operatives, because a fall in prices occasioned a large\r\nnumber of her factories to stop work, and turn their hands out of\r\nemployment. This happens every day in free society, from the bankruptcy\r\nof employers, or from the glut of markets and fall of prices. We will\r\nadd, that a meeting of the working men of New York, in the Park,\r\nasserted that there were 50,000 working men and women, in that city, out\r\nof employment last winter.\r\n\r\nThe competitive system (so injurious to the laboring class) is carried\r\nout with less exception or restriction in America than in Europe. Hence,\r\nconsidering the sparseness of our population, the laboring class are\r\nworse off in New York, Philadelphia and Boston, than in London,\r\nManchester or Paris. And this begets more Socialists in the higher\r\nclasses, and more mobs, riots and trade-unions, with the laborers, than\r\nin Europe.\r\n\r\nFinally, if it be excess of numbers, or want of liberty, that occasions\r\nthe failure of free society, why are our Abolitionists and Socialists\r\nso hot and so active in upsetting and re-organizing society? They have\r\npronounced, with entire unanimity, that free society is intolerable,\r\nwhether a country be densely or sparsely settled.\r\n\r\nThe Abolitionists boast, that lands are dearer and labor cheaper in free\r\nthan in slave society. Either proposition contains the admission that\r\nfree laborers work more for others and less for themselves than\r\nslaves--in effect, that they are less free than slaves. The profits of\r\nland are what the land-owner appropriates of the results of work of the\r\nlaborer. Where he appropriates most, and leaves the laborer least, there\r\nlands are dearest, labor cheapest, and laborers least free. In Europe,\r\nlands sell much higher than at the North; hence, laborers are less free\r\nin fact than at the North. In the North they sell higher than in the\r\nSouth, because the slaves consume more of the results of their own labor\r\nthan laborers at the North, and leave less profit to the land-owner. The\r\nhigh price of land is, in the general, an unerring indication of the\r\npoverty and actual slavery of the laboring class. Its low price, equally\r\nproves that the laborers, whether called slaves or freemen, work more\r\nfor themselves, and less for the land-owners, than where lands are dear.\r\nIn settled countries, where all the lands are appropriated, this theory\r\nis undeniable and irrefutable.\r\n\r\nAs this is a short chapter, we take the opportunity to apologize and\r\naccount for our discursive, immethodical and unartistic manner.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the character of the enemy we have to contend with\r\nprevents anything like regular warfare. They are divided into hundreds\r\nof little guerrilla bands of isms, each having its peculiar partizan\r\ntactics, and we are compelled to vary our mode of attack from regular\r\ncannonade to bush-fighting, to suit the occasion.\r\n\r\nAgain, we practiced as a jury lawyer for twenty-five years, and thereby\r\nacquired an inveterate habit of cumulation and iteration, and of various\r\nargument and illustration. But, at the same time, we learned how \"to\r\nmake out our case,\" and to know when it is \"made out.\" The lawyer who\r\nobserved the Unities in an argument before a jury would be sure to lose\r\nhis cause; and now the world is our jury, who are going to bring in a\r\nverdict against free society of \"guilty.\"\r\n\r\nWe admire not the pellucid rivulet, that murmurs and meanders, in\r\ncramped and artificial current, through the park and gardens of the\r\nnobleman; but we do admire the flooded and swollen Mississippi, whose\r\nturbid waters, in their majestic course, sweep along upon their bosom,\r\nwith equal composure, the occupants of the hen-roost and the poultry\r\nyard, the flocks, the herds, the crops, the uprooted forest, and the\r\nresidences of man. The Exhaustive, not the Artistic, is what we would\r\naspire to. And yet, the Exhaustive may be the highest art of argument.\r\nThe best mode, we think, of writing, is that in which facts, and\r\nargument, and rhetoric, and wit, and sarcasm, succeed each other with\r\nrapid iteration.\r\n\r\n  Intonuere poli, et crebris micat ignibus aether!\r\n\r\nAgain, Artistic execution is un-English. It neither suits their minds\r\nnor their tastes. Discursiveness and prurient exuberancy of thought and\r\nsuggestion, they often possess, but always fail when they attempt a\r\nliterary or other work of Art. Indeed, we have a strong suspicion that\r\nArt went out of the world about the time the Baconian Philosophy came\r\nin.\r\n\r\nA continuous argument, without pause or break, on a subject profoundly\r\nmetaphysical, equally fatigues the writer and the reader. Nobody likes\r\nit, and very few read it. \"Desipere in loco\" is not only a very\r\nagreeable maxim to the author, but a very wise and prudent one.\r\n\r\nLastly. Like Porthos, when \"we have an idea,\" we are at once seized with\r\na feverish anxiety to communicate it, and we think it better to break in\r\non the regular thread of our discourse, and do so at once, than to spoil\r\nour whole discourse by having our minds occupied with two subjects at a\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAnother idea strikes us. As yet we hardly aspire to the dignity of\r\nauthorship. We indulge in abandon, because, as a writer, we have no\r\nreputation to jeopard or to lose. But, should this book take, we will\r\nmount the antithetical stilts of auctorial dignity--write a book as\r\nstale and dry as \"the remainder biscuit after a long voyage,\" and as\r\nfree from originality, wit, thought or suggestiveness, as the Queen's\r\nSpeech, the President's Message, or a debate in the United States\r\nSenate. We do not as yet bore the world with \"respectable stupidity,\"\r\nbecause our position does not authorize it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL WEALTH, INDIVIDUAL WEALTH, LUXURY AND ECONOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a common theory with political economists, that national wealth\r\nis but the sum of individual wealth, and that as individual wealth\r\nincreases, national wealth increases, _pari passu_.\r\n\r\nWe think this theory false and pernicious, and the more so because it is\r\nplausible.\r\n\r\nAll profit-bearing possessions or capital, tend to exonerate their\r\nowners from labor, and to throw the labor that supports society on a\r\npart only of its members. Now, as almost all wealth is the product of\r\nlabor, this diminution of labor diminishes wealth, or, at least,\r\nincreases poverty, by placing heavier burdens on the laboring class.\r\n\r\nThis, however, is a very small part of the evil effects of individual\r\nwealth. Society requires it of the rich to live according to their\r\nincome, to fare sumptuously, to have costly dress, furniture, equipage,\r\nhouses, &c., and to keep many servants.\r\n\r\nTheir incomes are spent in luxuries, and thousands of laborers are taken\r\noff from the production of necessaries to produce those luxuries, or to\r\nwait on their owners. Thus, the burden of the support of society, so\r\nfar as the ordinary comforts and necessaries of life are concerned, are\r\nthrown on fewer and fewer, as private wealth and luxury increase. It\r\nrequires a thousand pauper laborers to sustain one millionaire, and\r\nwithout them his capital will produce no profit. This accounts for the\r\ngreat numbers and excessive poverty of the mass in England. Half the\r\nboasted capital of England, probably two-thirds of it, is but a mortgage\r\nof the bones and sinews of the laborers, now and forever, to the\r\ncapitalists. The national debt, stocks of all kinds, money at interest,\r\nand indeed all debts, represent this sort of private wealth, which is\r\nnational poverty.\r\n\r\nSumptuous houses, parks, and all establishments that are costly to\r\nsustain and keep up, and do not facilitate, but check the production of\r\nnecessaries, are also part of private wealth, and of national poverty.\r\nFour-fifths of the private wealth of England, and half of that of our\r\nNortheast, is a severe tax on labor, and a constant preventive of the\r\naccumulation of national wealth.\r\n\r\nPrivate wealth at the South consists chiefly in negro laborers, and\r\nimprovements of land, that increase its productive capacities. Fine\r\nenclosures, improved stock, good granaries, and machines and implements\r\nfor farming, comfortable negro cabins, good orchards, &c., are as\r\nstrictly a part of national, as of individual wealth. Not so with the\r\ncostly private dwellings in our Northern cities. The expense of\r\nbuilding, of repairing, of furnishing, and of keeping servants for their\r\nowners or tenants, is a constant drawback from productive industry,\r\nincreases the burdens of the laboring poor, and diminishes national\r\nwealth. The poverty-stricken fields of New England are the necessary\r\nconsequence of the luxurious expenditure in her cities. Yet that luxury\r\nis no part of national wealth, but a constant tax on it, whilst unproved\r\nfarms constitute almost three-fourths of all her real wealth, for they\r\nfeed and clothe mankind.\r\n\r\nThis is a most interesting subject; one which we have not mastered, or,\r\nif we had, this work on which we are engaged is not the proper one for\r\nits full discussion and exposition. We merely throw out a few\r\nsuggestions for the consideration of the thinking and ingenuous. If we\r\nare right, luxury is the greatest sin against society; economy and\r\nindustry, the chiefest of social virtues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nGOVERNMENT A THING OF FORCE, NOT OF CONSENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not agree with the authors of the Declaration of Independence,\r\nthat governments \"derive their just powers from the consent of the\r\ngoverned.\" The women, the children, the negroes, and but few of the\r\nnon-property holders were consulted, or consented to the Revolution, or\r\nthe governments that ensued from its success. As to these, the new\r\ngovernments were self-elected despotisms, and the governing class\r\nself-elected despots. Those governments originated in force, and have\r\nbeen continued by force. All governments must originate in force, and be\r\ncontinued by force. The very term, government, implies that it is\r\ncarried on against the consent of the governed. Fathers do not derive\r\ntheir authority, as heads of families, from the consent of wife and\r\nchildren, nor do they govern their families by their consent. They never\r\ntake the vote of the family as to the labors to be performed, the moneys\r\nto be expended, or as to anything else. Masters dare not take the vote\r\nof slaves, as to their government. If they did, constant holiday,\r\ndissipation and extravagance would be the result. Captains of ships are\r\nnot appointed by the consent of the crew, and never take their vote,\r\neven in \"doubling Cape Horn.\" If they did, the crew would generally vote\r\nto get drunk, and the ship would never weather the cape. Not even in the\r\nmost democratic countries are soldiers governed by their consent, nor is\r\ntheir vote taken on the eve of battle. They have some how lost (or never\r\nhad) the \"inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness;\" and, whether Americans or Russians, are forced into battle,\r\nwithout and often against their consent. The ancient republics were\r\ngoverned by a small class of adult male citizens, who assumed and\r\nexercised the government, without the consent of the governed. The South\r\nis governed just as those ancient republics were. In the county in which\r\nwe live, there are eighteen thousand souls, and only twelve hundred\r\nvoters. But we twelve hundred, the governors, never asked and never\r\nintend to ask the consent of the sixteen thousand eight hundred whom we\r\ngovern. Were we to do so, we should soon have an \"organized anarchy.\"\r\nThe governments of Europe could not exist a week without the positive\r\nforce of standing armies.\r\n\r\nThey are all governments of force, not of consent. Even in our North,\r\nthe women, children, and free negroes, constitute four-fifths of the\r\npopulation; and they are all governed without their consent. But they\r\nmean to correct this gross and glaring iniquity at the North. They hold\r\nthat all men, women, and negroes, and smart children, are equals, and\r\nentitled to equal rights. The widows and free negroes begin to vote in\r\nsome of those States, and they will have to let all colors and sexes and\r\nages vote soon, or give up the glorious principles of human equality and\r\nuniversal emancipation.\r\n\r\nThe experiment which they will make, we fear, is absurd in theory, and\r\nthe symptoms of approaching anarchy and agrarianism among them, leave no\r\ndoubt that its practical operation will be no better than its theory.\r\nAnti-rentism, \"vote-myself-a-farm\" ism, and all the other isms, are but\r\nthe spattering drops that precede a social deluge.\r\n\r\nAbolition ultimates in \"Consent Government;\" Consent Government in\r\nAnarchy, Free Love, Agrarianism, &c., &c., and \"Self-elected despotism,\"\r\nwinds up the play.\r\n\r\nIf the interests of the governors, or governing class, be not\r\nconservative, they certainly will not conserve institutions injurious to\r\ntheir interests. There never was and never can be an old society, in\r\nwhich the immediate interests of a majority of human souls do not\r\nconflict with all established order, all right of property, and all\r\nexisting institutions. Immediate interest is all the mass look to; and\r\nthey would be sure to revolutionize government, as often as the\r\nsituation of the majority was worse than that of the minority. Divide\r\nall property to-day, and a year hence the inequalities of property would\r\nprovoke a re-division.\r\n\r\nIn the South, the interest of the governing class is eminently\r\nconservative, and the South is fast becoming the most conservative of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\nAlready, at the North, government vibrates and oscillates between\r\nRadicalism and Conservatism; at present, Radicalism or Black\r\nRepublicanism is in the ascendant.\r\n\r\nThe number of paupers is rapidly increasing; radical and agrarian\r\ndoctrines are spreading; the women and the children, and the negroes,\r\nwill soon be let in to vote; and then they will try the experiment of\r\n\"Consent Government and Constituted Anarchy.\"\r\n\r\nIt is falsely said, that revolutions never go backwards. They always go\r\nbackwards, and generally farther back than where they started. The\r\nSocial Revolution now going on at the North, must some day go backwards.\r\nShall it do so now, ere it has perpetrated an infinitude of mischief,\r\nshed oceans of blood, and occasioned endless human misery; or will the\r\nConservatives of the North let it run the length of its leather, inflict\r\nall these evils, and then rectify itself by issuing into military\r\ndespotism? We think that by a kind of alliance, offensive and defensive,\r\nwith the South, Northern Conservatism may now arrest and turn back the\r\ntide of Radicalism and Agrarianism. We will not presume to point out\r\nthe whole means and modus operandi. They on the field of action will\r\nbest see what is necessary to be done.\r\n\r\nWhilst we hold that all government is a matter of force, we yet think\r\nthe governing class should be numerous enough to understand, and so\r\nsituated as to represent fairly, all interests. The Greek and Roman\r\nmasters were thus situated; so were the old Barons of England, and so\r\nare the white citizens of the South. If not all masters, like Greek and\r\nRoman citizens, they all belong to the master race, have exclusive\r\nrights and privileges of citizenship, and an interest not to see this\r\nright of citizenship extended, disturbed, and rendered worthless and\r\ncontemptible.\r\n\r\nWhilst the governments of Europe are more obviously kept alive and\r\nconducted by force than at any other period, yet are they all, from\r\nnecessity, watchful and regardful of Public Opinion. Opinion now rules\r\nthe world, but not as expressed through the ballot-box. Governments\r\nbecome more popular as they become more forcible. A large governing\r\nclass is not apt to mistake or disregard opinion; and, therefore,\r\nRepublican institutions are best adapted to the times. Under Monarchical\r\nforms, the governments of Europe are daily becoming more Republican. The\r\nfatal error committed in Western Europe is, the wielding of government\r\nby a class who govern, but do not represent, the masses. Their\r\ninterests and those of the masses are antagonistic, whilst those of\r\nmasters and slaves are identical.\r\n\r\nLooking to theory, to the examples of the Ancient Republics, and to\r\nEngland under the Plantagenets, we shall find that Southern institutions\r\nare far the best now existing in the world.\r\n\r\nWe think speculations as to constructing governments are little worth;\r\nfor all government is the gradual accretion of Nature, time and\r\ncircumstances. Yet these theories have occurred to us, and, as they are\r\nconservative, we will suggest them. In slaveholding countries all\r\nfreemen should vote and govern, because their interests are\r\nconservative. In free states, the government should be in the hands of\r\nthe land-owners, who are also conservative. A system of primogeniture,\r\nand entails of small parcels of land, might, in a great measure,\r\nidentify the interests of all; or, at least, those who held no lands\r\nwould generally be the children and kinsmen of those who did, and be\r\ntaken care of by them. The frequent accumulation of large fortunes, and\r\nconsequent pauperism of the masses, is the greatest evil of modern\r\nsociety. Would not small entails prevent this? All cannot own lands, but\r\nas many should own them as is consistent with good farming and advanced\r\ncivilization. The social institutions of the Jews, as established by\r\nMoses and Joshua, most nearly fulfill our ideas of perfect government.\r\n\r\nA word, at parting, to Northern Conservatives. A like danger threatens\r\nNorth and South, proceeding from the same source. Abolitionism is\r\nmaturing what Political Economy began. With inexorable sequence \"Let\r\nAlone\" is made to usher in No-Government. North and South our danger is\r\nthe same, and our remedies, though differing in degree, must in\r\ncharacter be the same. \"Let Alone\" must be repudiated, if we would have\r\nany Government. We must, in all sections, act upon the principle that\r\nthe world is \"too little governed,\" You of the North need not institute\r\nnegro slavery; far less reduce white men to the state of negro slavery.\r\nBut the masses require more of protection, and the masses and\r\nphilosophers equally require more of control. Leave it to time and\r\ncircumstances to suggest the necessary legislation; but, rely upon it,\r\n\"Anarchy, plus the street constable,\" wont answer any longer. The\r\nVigilance Committee of California is but a mob, rendered necessary by\r\nthe inadequacy of the regular government. It is the \"vis medicatrix\r\nnaturae,\" vainly attempting to discharge the office of physician. That\r\ncountry is \"too little governed,\" where the best and most conservative\r\ncitizens have to resolve themselves into mobs and vigilance committees\r\nto protect rights which government should, but dues not, protect.\r\n\r\nThe element of force exists probably in too small a degree in our\r\nFederal Government. It has neither territory nor subjects. Kansas is\r\nbetter off; for she has a few citizens and a large and fertile\r\nterritory. She is backing the Government out, if not whipping her.\r\nMassachusetts, too, has nullified her laws. Utah contemns her authority,\r\nand the Vigilance Committee of California sets her at successful\r\ndefiance. She is an attempt at a _paper consent_ government, without\r\nterritory or citizens. Considered and treated as a league or treaty\r\nbetween _separate States_ or _Nations_, she may yet have a long and\r\nuseful existence; for then those _Nations_ or _States_, seeing that she\r\nhas no means of self-enforcement, self-support, or self-conservation,\r\nmay, for their mutual interests, combine to sustain and defend her.\r\nHeretofore, domestic weakness and danger from foreign foes has combined\r\nthe States in sustaining the Union. Hereafter, the great advantages of\r\nfriendly and mutual intercourse, trade and exchanges, may continue to\r\nproduce a like result. But the prospects are alarming, and it is well\r\nthat all patriots should know that the Union has little power to sustain\r\nand perpetuate itself.\r\n\r\nThere are three kinds of force that occur to us will sustain a\r\ngovernment. First, \"inside necessity,\" such as slavery, that occasions a\r\nfew to usurp power, and to hold it forcibly, without consulting the\r\nmany; secondly, the force of foreign pressure or aggression, which\r\ncombines men and States together for common defence; and thirdly, the\r\ninherent force of a prescriptive or usurpative government, which\r\nsustains itself by standing armies. Such are all the governments of\r\nWestern Europe. Not one of them could exist forty-eight hours, but for\r\nthe standing armies. These standing armies became necessary and grew up\r\nas slavery disappeared. The old Barons kept the Canaille, the\r\nProletariat, the Sans Culottes, the Nomadic Beggars, in order, by\r\nlashing their backs and supplying their wants. They must be fed and kept\r\nat work. Modern society tries to effect this (but in vain) by moral\r\nsuasion and standing armies. Riots, mobs, strikes and revolutions are\r\ndaily occurring. The mass of mankind cannot be governed by Law. More of\r\ndespotic discretion, and less of Law, is what the world wants. We take\r\nour leave by saying, \"THERE IS TOO MUCH OF LAW AND TOO LITTLE OF\r\nGOVERNMENT IN THIS WORLD.\"\r\n\r\nPhysical force, not moral suasion, governs the world. The negro sees the\r\ndriver's lash, becomes accustomed to obedient, cheerful industry, and is\r\nnot aware that the lash is the force that impels him. The free citizen\r\nfulfills, \"con amore,\" his round of social, political and domestic\r\nduties, and never dreams that the Law, with its fines and jails,\r\npenitentiaries and halters, or Public Opinion, with its ostracism, its\r\nmobs, and its tar and feathers, help to keep him revolving in his\r\norbit. Yet, remove these physical forces, and how many good citizens\r\nwould shoot, like fiery comets, from their spheres, and disturb society\r\nwith their eccentricities and their crimes.\r\n\r\nGovernment is the life of a nation, and as no one can foresee the\r\nvarious future circumstances of social, any more than of individual\r\nlife, it is absurd to define on paper, at the birth of either the nation\r\nor individual, what they shall do and what not do. Broad construction of\r\nconstitutions is as good as no constitution, for it leaves the nation to\r\nadapt itself to circumstances; but strict construction will destroy any\r\nnation, for action is necessary to national conservation, and\r\nconstitution-makers cannot foresee what action will be necessary. If\r\nindividual or social life were passed in mere passivity, constitutions\r\nmight answer. Not in a changing and active world. Louisiana, Florida and\r\nTexas would have been denied to the South under strict construction, and\r\nshe would have been ruined. A constitution, strictly construed, is\r\nabsolutely inconsistent with permanent national existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nWARNING TO THE NORTH.\r\n\r\n      _Banquo_--      But 'tis strange:\r\n      And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,\r\n      The instruments of darkness tell us truths;\r\n      Win us with honest trifles, to betray us\r\n      In deepest consequences.\r\n\r\n                                                MACBETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader must have remarked our propensity of putting scraps of poetry\r\nat the head of our chapters, or of interweaving them with the text. It\r\nanswers as a sort of chorus or refrain, and, when skillfully handled,\r\nhas as fine an effect as the fiddle at a feast, or the brass band on the\r\neve of an engagement. It nerves the author for greater effort, and\r\ninspires the reader with resolution to follow him in his most profound\r\nratiocinations and airiest speculations. We learnt it from \"our Masters\r\nin the art of war\" when we carried their camp and their whole park of\r\nartillery, (which we are now using with such murderous effect against\r\ntheir own ranks.) We also captured their camp equipage, books of\r\nmilitary strategy, &c. In them we found rules laid down for the famous\r\nsongs, which are so harmoniously blended with the speeches at all\r\nInfidel and Abolition conventions, and Women's Rights and Free Love\r\nassemblages. They are intended to inspire enthusiasm, confirm\r\nconviction, and to \"screw the courage to the sticking point.\" Besides,\r\nsometimes they answer admirably the opposite purpose of a sedative.\r\nOften, when Sister This One has, by her imprudent speech, outraged\r\ndecency, propriety, religion and morality, and drawn down upon her head\r\nhisses and cries of \"Turn her out! Turn her out!\" Brother That One\r\nbursts forth in \"strains of sweetest melody,\" and like another Orpheus\r\nquells and quiets another hell. Not that we intend by any means to\r\nintimate that this musical brother would play Orpheus throughout, and\r\ntake as long and perilous a trip to rescue his sister as Orpheus did for\r\nEurydice. On the contrary, we suspect in such contingency he would pray\r\nto Pluto to double bar the gates, and bribe Cerberus to keep closer\r\nwatch. We derive this impression from the triangular correspondence of\r\nGreeley, Andrews and James, entitled \"Love, Marriage and Divorce;\" and\r\nfrom the actings and doings of the courts and legislature of\r\nMassachusetts--who, from the number of the divorces they grant, we\r\nshould think could hardly find time to send Hiss on a visit of\r\npurification to the Convents.\r\n\r\nNow it may be, that sometimes, when we \"have gone it rather strong\" (as\r\nwe are very apt to do,) and offended the reader, our scraps of poetry\r\nmay answer the purpose of the Abolition songs, and soothe and\r\npropitiate him. Besides, they afford a sort of interlude or by-play,\r\nlike that of Sancho where he slipped off from the flying horse,\r\nClavileno, just as he and the Don had reached the constellation of the\r\nGoat, and went to playing with the little goats to relieve the giddiness\r\nof his head. I am sure, when we have, as we often do, mounted with our\r\nreader into the highest regions of metaphysics, that his head becomes a\r\nlittle giddy, (at least ours does,) and that he is thankful for a little\r\npoetry or a turn at play with our Abolition Goats. \"Goats, indeed!\"\r\nquoth Mr. G----, \"Lions, you had better say.\" Well, be it lions! We are\r\nno more afraid of you than if you were lambs; and you will no sooner\r\ndare to attack us than you did the Knight of La Mancha when he vainly\r\nchallenged you to mortal combat.\r\n\r\nLet not the reader suppose that we either emulate the chivalry of the\r\nDon or the wisdom of his Squire. A Northern clime has congealed the\r\ncourage of our lions and they are afraid of the \"paper bullets of the\r\nbrain;\" yet they are vastly fond of shooting them at others, provided\r\nthey are sure the shot will not be returned.\r\n\r\nAs for Sancho, we think him the wisest man we ever read after, except\r\nSolomon. Indeed, in the world of Fiction, all the wisdom issues from the\r\nmouths of fools--as witness Shakspeare's Falstaff and his fools. There\r\nis at least vraisemblance in all this; for, as in the Real world, the\r\nphilosophers (e. g. our Masters in the art of war) have monopolized all\r\nthe folly,--where so likely to find the wisdom as among the fools?\r\n\r\nWe fear our \"Little Cannibals\" are growing impatient, and may be, a\r\nlittle jealous of our seeming preference for our goats. They are young\r\nyet and require nursing. But they are young Herculeses, born with teeth,\r\nand if any Abolition serpents attempt to strangle them in the cradle,\r\nthey'll be apt to get the worst of it. The danger is, however, that the\r\nAbolitionists will steal and adopt them--for they are vastly fond of\r\nyoung cannibals, and employ much of their time in sewing and knitting\r\nand getting up subscriptions, to send shirts and trowsers to the little\r\nfellows away over in Africa, who as indignantly repel them as old King\r\nLear did when he stripped in the storm and resolved to be his\r\n\"unsophisticated self.\"\r\n\r\nNow, seeing that the Abolitionists are so devoted to the uncouth, dirty,\r\nnaked little cannibals of Africa, haven't we good reason to fear that\r\nthey will run away with and adopt ours, when they come forth neatly\r\ndressed in black muslin and all shining with gold from the master hands\r\nof Morris and Wynne? They will be sure at least to captivate the hearts\r\nof the strong-minded ladies, and if they will treat them well in\r\ninfancy, we don't know but what, if they will wait till they grow up, we\r\nmay spare them a husband or two from the number.\r\n\r\nMr. Morris has promised they shall be black as Erebus without, and white\r\nas \"driven snow\" within.\r\n\r\nIf they can get over the trying time of infancy--if the critics don't\r\nsmother them in the cradle, the boys will make their own way in the\r\nworld, and get a name famous as Toussaint or Dessalines.\r\n\r\nTo be candid with the reader, we have learned lately that the physique\r\nof a book is quite as important as its metaphysique--the outside as the\r\ninside. Figure, size, proportion, are all to be consulted: for books are\r\nnow used quite as much for centre table ornaments as for reading. We\r\nhave a marble one on our centre table that answers the former purpose\r\nadmirably, because nobody can put puzzling questions about its contents.\r\nNow, we must write the exact amount, and no more, to enable Mr. Morris\r\nand Mr. Wynne to make our book appear externally \"comme il faut.\" We\r\nwrite this chapter in part for that purpose. The reader would not object\r\nto a page, or so, more or less of it, and Mr. Morris and Mr. Wynne will\r\nknow how to curtail or omit, for they are not only masters of their own\r\ntrades, but can render us valuable assistance in ours.\r\n\r\nWe return to our Cannibals, with this single remark to that morose and\r\ndemure reader who is snarling at our occasional levity--\"You, sir, never\r\nthrow off your dignity; because you would be sure to uncover your\r\nfolly.\"\r\n\r\nWe warn the North, that every one of the leading Abolitionists is\r\nagitating the negro slavery question merely as a means to attain\r\nulterior ends, and those ends nearer home. They would not spend so much\r\ntime and money for the mere sake of the negro or his master, about whom\r\nthey care little. But they know that men once fairly committed to negro\r\nslavery agitation--once committed to the sweeping principle, \"that man\r\nbeing a moral agent, accountable to God for his actions, should not have\r\nthose actions controlled and directed by the will of another,\" are, in\r\neffect, committed to Socialism and Communism, to the most ultra\r\ndoctrines of Garrison, Goodell, Smith and Andrews--to no private\r\nproperty, no church, no law, no government,--to free love, free lands,\r\nfree women and free churches.\r\n\r\nThere is no middle ground--not an inch of ground of any sort, between\r\nthe doctrines which we hold and those which Mr. Garrison holds. If\r\nslavery, either white or black, be wrong in principle or practice, then\r\nis Mr. Garrison right--then is all human government wrong.\r\n\r\nSocialism, not Abolition, is the real object of Black Republicanism. The\r\nNorth, not the South, the true battle-ground. Like Fanny Wright, the\r\nauthor of American Socialism, the agitators of the North look upon free\r\nsociety as a mere transition state to a better, but untried, form of\r\nsociety. The reader will not fully comprehend the ideas we would\r\nconvey, without reading \"England the Civilizer,\" by Miss Fanny\r\nWright. It is worth reading, not only as far the best history of\r\nthe British constitution, but as the most correct and perfect\r\nanalysis and delineation of free society--of that form of society\r\nwhich all Socialists and all thinking men agree cannot stand as\r\nit is. The Abolition school of Socialists like it because it is\r\nintolerable--because they consider it a transition state to a form of\r\nsociety without law or government. Miss Wright has the honesty to admit,\r\nthat a _transition_ has never taken place. No; and never will take\r\nplace: because the expulsion of human nature is a pre-requisite to its\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nBut we solemnly warn the North, that what she calls a _transition_, is\r\nwhat every leading Abolitionist is moving heaven and earth to attain.\r\nThis is their real object--negro emancipation a mere gull-trap.\r\n\r\nIn the attempt to attain \"transition\" seas of gore may be shed, until\r\nmilitary despotism comes in to restore peace and security.\r\n\r\nWe (for we are a Socialist) agree with Mr. Carlyle, that the action of\r\nfree society must be reversed. That, instead of relaxing more and more\r\nthe bonds that bind man to man, you must screw them up more closely.\r\nThat, instead of no government, you must have more government. And this\r\nis eminently true in America, where from the nature of things, as\r\nsociety becomes older and population more dense, more of government will\r\nbe required. To prevent the attempt at transition, which would only\r\nusher in revolution, you must begin to govern more vigorously.\r\n\r\nBut we will be asked, How is this to be effected? The answer is easy.\r\nThe means are at hand, and the work is begun.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party, purged of its radicalism and largely recruited\r\nfrom the ranks of the old line Whigs, has become eminently and actively\r\nconservative. It is the antipodes of the Democratic party of the days of\r\nJefferson, in the grounds which it occupies and the opinions which it\r\nholds, (what it professes to hold is another thing.) Yet it has been a\r\nconsistent party throughout. Consistent, in wisely and boldly adapting\r\nits action to the emergencies of the occasion. It is pathological, and\r\npractices according to prevailing symptoms. 'Tis true, it has a mighty\r\nNosology in its Declaration of Independence, Bills of Rights,\r\nConstitutions, Platforms, and Preambles and Resolutions; but, like a\r\ngood physician, it watches the state of the patient, and casts Nosology\r\nto the dogs when the symptoms require it. When we entered the party we\r\nwere radicals, and half Abolitionists, and found inscribed on its\r\nbanner, \"_The world is too much governed!_\" Now, we are sure the\r\nconviction has fastened itself on the heart of every good citizen, that\r\n\"the world is too little governed.\"\r\n\r\nThe true and honorable distinction of the Democratic party is, that it\r\nhas but one unbending principle--\"The safety of the people is the\r\nsupreme law.\" To this party we think the Nation and the North may\r\nconfidently look for a happy exodus from our difficulties. It is pure,\r\nhonest, active and patriotic now, and will continue so as long as the\r\ndark cloud of Abolition and Socialism lowers and threatens at the North.\r\nLong and quiet possession of power will be sure to corrupt it. It will\r\nbe then time to cast it aside. It is now able, and it alone is able, to\r\ngrapple with and strangle the treasons of the North.\r\n\r\n  \"Times change, and men change with them.\"\r\n\r\nGood and brave men are proud, not ashamed, of such changes. Let no false\r\npride of seeming consistency deter us from an avowal, which omitted, may\r\ntrammel and impede our action.\r\n\r\nOur old Nosology is an effective arsenal and armory for the most ultra\r\nAbolitionists, and the more effective, because we have not _formally_\r\nrepudiated it. Let \"_The world is too little governed_\" be adopted as\r\nour motto, inscribed upon our flag and run up to the mast-head.\r\n\r\n    NOTE.--We learn that many of the old Federalists of the North, and\r\n    some of the South, are joining our ranks. We welcome them. Their\r\n    principles were wrong when they adopted them, but (barring their\r\n    consolidation doctrines) will answer pretty well now. It was ever\r\n    the misfortune of the old Federal party and the lately deceased\r\n    Whig party, to be right at the wrong time. They were, as the\r\n    doctors say, nosological and not pathological in practice. The\r\n    Whig party of England, like the Democratic party of America, is\r\n    eminently pathological, active, observant and impressible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nADDENDUM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        _Virginia, Nov. 18, 1856._\r\n\r\nWM. LLOYD GARRISON, Esq.:\r\n\r\nDEAR SIR--I have observed so much fairness in the manner in which\r\nslavery and other sociological questions are treated in _The Liberator_,\r\nthat it has occurred to me you would not consider suggestions from an\r\nultra pro-slavery man obtrusive, and might deem them worth a place in\r\nyour columns. I shall not promise that the example of your liberality\r\nwill be followed at the South. It is a theory of mine, that \"recurrence\r\nto fundamental principles\" is only treason clothed in periphrastic\r\nphrase; and that the right of private judgment, liberty of the press,\r\nfreedom of speech, and freedom of religion, are subordinate to these\r\n\"principles,\" and must not be allowed to assail them,--else there can be\r\nno stability in government, or security of private rights. The South\r\nthinks me heretical, but feels that I am right, and takes care to\r\ntrammel these sacred rights quite as efficiently by an austere public\r\nopinion, as Louis Napoleon does by law or by mere volition.\r\n\r\nI entirely concur in a theory I heard Mr. Wendell Phillips[35] propound\r\nin a lecture at New Haven. I shall not attempt to give his eloquent\r\nwords, for I am incapable of doing justice to his language; but the\r\namount of his theory was, that governments are not formed by man, but\r\nare the gradual accretions of time, circumstance, and human exigencies;\r\nthat they grow up like trees, and that man may cultivate, train and aid\r\ntheir growth and development, but cannot make them out and out. Now, I\r\naccept the theory, and propose, in the first place, to deter men from\r\napplying the axe to the root of our Southern institutions, (that is,\r\ndiscussing or recurring to \"fundamental principles,\") by moral suasion\r\nor monition; next, by tar and feathers, and, that failing, by the\r\nhalter. The worst institutions that ever _grew up_ in any country are\r\nbetter than the best that philosophers or philanthropists ever devised.\r\nAs for ours, we deem them, since the days of Rome, Athens and Judea, the\r\ncrack institutions of the world.\r\n\r\nWith these preliminary remarks, I will make the following suggestions or\r\ninterrogations:--\r\n\r\nIs not slavery to capital less tolerable than slavery to human masters?\r\n\r\nWhere a few, as in England, Ireland and Scotland, own all the lands, are\r\nnot the mass, the common laborers, who own no capital, and possess\r\nneither mechanical nor professional skill, of necessity, the slaves to\r\ncapital?\r\n\r\nWas it not this slavery to capital that occasioned the great Irish\r\nfamine, and is it not this same slavery that keeps the large majority of\r\nthe laboring class in Western Europe in a state of hereditary\r\nstarvation?\r\n\r\nIn old societies, where the laborers are domestic slaves, and exceed in\r\nnumber the demand for labor, would not emancipating them subject them at\r\nonce to a mastery, or exacting despotism of capital, far more oppressive\r\nthan domestic slavery?\r\n\r\nDid not the emancipation of European serfs, or villiens, in all\r\ninstances, injure their condition as a class?\r\n\r\nIn the event of the occurrence of such excess of domestic slaves, would\r\nit not be more merciful to follow the Spartan plan, and kill the\r\nsurplus, than the abolition plan, which sets them all free, to live on\r\nhalf allowance, and to \"make free labor cheaper than slave labor,\" by\r\nthis fierce competition and underbidding to get employment?\r\n\r\nAre there not fewer checks to superior wit, skill and capital, and less\r\nof protection afforded to the weak, ignorant and landless mass in\r\nNorthern society, than in any other ever devised by the wit of man?\r\n\r\nIs not \"_laissez-faire_,\" in English, \"Every man for himself, and devil\r\ntake the hindmost,\" your whole theory and practice of government?\r\n\r\nWhen your society grows older, your population more dense, and property,\r\nby your trading, speculating and commercial habits, gets into a few\r\nhands, will not the slavery to capital be more complete and unmitigated\r\nthan in any part of Europe, where a throne, a nobility and established\r\nchurch, stand between the bosses, bankers and landlords, and the\r\noppressed masses?\r\n\r\nDo not almost all well-informed men of a philosophical turn of mind in\r\nWestern Europe and our North, concur in opinion that the whole framework\r\nof society, religious, ethical, economic, legal and political, requires\r\nradical change?\r\n\r\nIs not the absence of such opinion at the South, and its prevalence in\r\nfree society, conclusive proof of the naturalness and necessity of\r\ndomestic slavery?\r\n\r\nWould not the North be willing to leave the settlement of the slavery\r\nquestion in Kansas to the public opinion of Christendom, (for it will be\r\nsettled by all Christendom, of whom not one in a hundred will be\r\nslaveholders,) if it were not sensible that public opinion was about to\r\ndecide in favor of _negro_ slavery, and, therefore, that it must be\r\nforstalled by Federal legislation?\r\n\r\n                                                     A SOUTHERNER.\r\n\r\nSince our work was in the press, the above has appeared in the\r\n_Liberator_. We embrace the occasion to thank Mr. Garrison for his\r\ncourtesy, and to make a few remarks that we hope will not be deemed\r\nill-timed or impertinent.\r\n\r\nA comparison of opinions and of institutions between North and South\r\nwill lead to kinder and more pacific relations. Hitherto, such\r\ncomparisons could not be made, because the South believed herself\r\nwrong, weak and defenceless; and that Abolition was but an attempt to\r\napply the brand to the explosive materials of her social edifice. She is\r\nnow equally confident of her justice and her strength, and believes her\r\nsocial system more stable, as well as more benevolent, equitable and\r\nnatural, than that of the North. Whilst she will never tolerate radical\r\nagitation and demagoguical propagandism, she is ready for philosophical\r\nargument and discussion, and for historical and statistical comparison.\r\n\r\nA Southerner employs the term \"discussion,\" as equivalent to agitation;\r\nfor the South does not proscribe the discussion of any subject, by\r\nproper persons, at proper places, and on proper occasions. (Who are\r\nproper persons, and what proper times and places, must be left to a\r\nhealthy, just and enlightened public opinion to determine.) But men\r\nshall not lecture our children, in the streets, on the beauties of\r\ninfidelity; parsons shall not preach politics from the pulpit; women\r\nshall not crop the petticoat, mount the rostrum, and descant on the\r\npurity of Free Love; incendiaries shall not make speeches against the\r\nright of landholders, nor teach our negroes the sacred doctrines of\r\nliberty and equality.\r\n\r\nWe are satisfied with our institutions, and are not willing to submit\r\nthem to the \"experimentum in vile corpus!\" If the North thinks her own\r\nworthless, or only valuable as subjects for anatomical dissection, or\r\nchemical and phrenological experiments, she may advance the cause of\r\nhumanity, by treating her people as philosophers do mice and hares and\r\ndead frogs. We think her case not so desperate as to authorize such\r\nreckless experimentation. Though her experiment has failed, she is not\r\nyet dead. There is a way still open for recovery.\r\n\r\nAs we are a Brother Socialist, we have a right to prescribe for the\r\npatient; and our Consulting Brethren, Messrs. Garrison, Greely, and\r\nothers, should duly consider the value of our opinion. Extremes\r\nmeet--and we and the leading Abolitionists differ but a hairbreadth.\r\nWe, like Carlyle, prescribe more of government; they insist on\r\nNo-Government. Yet their social institutions would make excellently\r\nconducted Southern sugar and cotton farms, with a head to govern them.\r\nAdd a Virginia overseer to Mr. Greely's Phalansteries, and Mr. Greely\r\nand we would have little to quarrel about.\r\n\r\nWe have a lively expectation that when our Cannibals make their entree,\r\n\"Our Masters in the art of War\" will greet them with applause, instead\r\nof hisses; with a \"feu de joie,\" or gratulatory salute, instead of a\r\nmurderous broadside. We want to be friends with them and with all the\r\nworld; and, as the curtain is falling, we conclude with the valedictory\r\nand invocation of the Roman actor--\"Vos valete! et plaudite!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Not only does Moses evince his knowledge of the despotism of\r\ncapital, in forbidding its profits, but also in his injunction, not to\r\nlet emancipated slaves \"go away empty.\" Deuteronomy xv. 13, 14.\r\n\r\n\"And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not let him go\r\naway empty. Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out\r\nof thy floor, and out of thy wine-press: of that wherewith the Lord thy\r\nGod hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.\"\r\n\r\nPeople without property exposed to the unrestricted exactions of capital\r\nare infinitely worse off after emancipation than before. Moses prevented\r\nthe exactions of capital by providing property for the new free man.\r\n\r\n[2] History of the Poor Laws, p. 120.\r\n\r\n[3] 11 Hen. VII. cap. 2.\r\n\r\n[4] 22 Hen.
