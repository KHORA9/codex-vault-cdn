The remainder of the time I traveled along the\r\nWestern Front, from the Esthonian border to Moghilev, with leisurely\r\nstops at Pskov, Vitebsk, Polotzk, Smolensk, and numerous small towns. I\r\ntried to see as much as possible of this vast and unknown land in the\r\nshort time at my disposal, and I tried especially to check up from\r\nfirst-hand observation some of the many things I had heard on the\r\noutside. I also tried to test the truth of what was told me in Russia\r\nitself,—to find visible evidence of the fairness of the claims made.\r\nSome popular fancies were quickly dispelled. Disproof of others came\r\nsometimes in vividly concrete fashion.\r\n\r\nSoviet Russia is not unanimously Bolshevist, any more than the United\r\nStates has ever been unanimously Democratic or Republican, or\r\nProhibitionist. The speculators are not Bolshevist, nor are the\r\nirreconcilable bourgeoisie, nor the Monarchists, nor the Cadets nor the\r\nMenshevists, nor the Social Revolutionists and Anarchists. Nevertheless\r\nRussia stands overwhelmingly in support of the Soviet Government, just\r\nas the United States stands overwhelmingly in support of Congress and\r\nthe Constitution. There are many who are opposed to Soviet rule in its\r\npresent form, and this opposition is not confined to the old bourgeoisie\r\nand the anarchists. It prevails to a certain extent—variously\r\nestimated—among the peasants. But it is an opposition which ceases at\r\nthe military frontier of the nation. I found many critics of Soviet rule\r\nwithin Soviet Russia, but they insisted that whatever changes are to be\r\nmade in the government must be made without foreign interference. At\r\npresent their first interest is the defence of Russian soil and the\r\nRussian state against foreign assault and foreign interference.\r\n\r\nThe peasant opposition is mainly due to the deficiencies in\r\ntransportation and the shortage of manufactured articles. They blame\r\nthis on the government, much as other peoples lay their troubles to “the\r\ngovernment.” The peasants are reluctant to give up their grain for paper\r\nmoney which is of no value to them unless it will buy shoes and cloth\r\nand salt and tools,—and of these necessities there are not enough to go\r\nround. While the blockade continued the government was striving\r\nvigorously to overcome the shortage of manufactured articles brought\r\nabout by the blockade, knowing that this alone would satisfy the\r\npeasants. They claimed to have made encouraging progress, especially in\r\nthe production of agricultural machinery, of which they were trying to\r\nhave the largest possible supply ready by spring.\r\n\r\nWhatever the state of mind of the peasants, they are certainly better\r\noff materially than the city workers. In all the villages I visited I\r\nfound the peasants faring much better than were the Commissars in\r\nMoscow. They had plentiful supplies of good rye bread on their tables,\r\nwith butter and eggs and milk,—almost unknown luxuries in the cities.\r\nTheir cattle looked well fed and well cared for. It was harvest time and\r\nthe farmers were gathering in their crops. They told me that the season\r\nhad been exceptionally bountiful.\r\n\r\nI learned after my return to America that there had been a great deal of\r\nagitation among the upholders of the old Russian order in this country\r\nlast summer and early fall over the pogroms which were said to have been\r\ncarried on by the Bolsheviki. I found nothing but cooperation and\r\nsympathy and understanding between the Russians and the Jews. There was\r\nno discrimination whatsoever, as far as I could see. Jews and Russians\r\nshare alike in the councils of the Soviet Government and in the\r\nfactories and workshops.\r\n\r\nIn fact I found nothing but the utmost kindness and good will towards\r\nthe whole world, all through Russia. \"If they will only let us alone\r\nthey have nothing to fear from us,—not even propaganda,\"—was said to me\r\nover and over again. There were no threats made against the\r\ninterventionists. The Soviet forces merely went ahead and demonstrated\r\ntheir strength and ability to defend themselves, and left the record of\r\ntheir achievements to speak for itself.\r\n\r\n                                              ISAAC MCBRIDE.\r\n\r\n  “Kloshe Illahe,”\r\n    Bethel, Connecticut,\r\n      March, 1920.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       “Barbarous Soviet Russia”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I\r\n                           ENTERING RED LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n“You will never return alive. They will slaughter you. They will rob you\r\nof everything. They will take your clothes from your very back.”\r\n\r\nWith stubborn conviction the dapper young Lettish gentleman spoke to me\r\nas he attempted to change my mind about going into Soviet Russia. He was\r\nattached to the Foreign Information Bureau of Latvia. He had been in\r\nRiga all through the Bolshevist régime, from November, 1918, to May,\r\n1919, when the German army of occupation in the Baltic provinces drove\r\nthem out. There was nothing he could not tell me about that régime. He\r\nwas especially eager to impart his experiences to foreign journalists.\r\n\r\n“Was it really so terrible, then?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Nothing could have been worse,” he repeated. \"Many persons were killed\r\nby the Bolshevists—I saw them myself—but not so many as when the Germans\r\nbegan their slaughter. There was the Bolshevist program of\r\nnationalization. They nationalized the land. They nationalized the\r\nfactories. They nationalized the banks and the large office buildings,\r\nand even the residences.\r\n\r\n“Aristocratic women were taken from their comfortable homes and forced\r\nto wait on Bolshevist Commissars in the Soviet dining-rooms. One of our\r\nleading citizens, a man who through hard work had accumulated a great\r\nfortune, was put to work cleaning streets. His fine house with thirty or\r\nforty beautiful rooms, where he lived quite alone with his wife and\r\nservants, was taken away from him, and he was moved into a house in\r\nanother part of the city on a mean street where he had never been\r\nbefore. His home was taken over by the ‘state’ and seven families of the\r\nso-called proletariat were lodged in it. One of our generals was\r\ncompelled to sell newspapers on the streets. Our leading artists were\r\nforced to paint lamp posts—and the color was red. They made the\r\nuniversity students cut ice.”\r\n\r\n“And the women—did they nationalize them?” I interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Well, no, they didn’t do that here in Riga,” he said, “but that was\r\nbecause they were not here long enough to put it into effect. They were\r\nso busy confiscating property in the six months they held sway that they\r\nhad little time for anything else. No, they didn’t nationalize the women\r\nin Riga, but you will find they have done so in Moscow.\r\n\r\n“But you must not go to Moscow,” he added. “You will surely never return\r\nalive—but if you do, please come and tell me what you have seen.” And\r\nmournfully he wished me a safe journey.\r\n\r\nI returned to the Foreign Office the next day determined to get\r\npermission at once to pass through the Lettish front into Soviet Russia.\r\nIt was a hot August day. Officers and attachés sat around panting,\r\nobviously bored that any one should come at this time to annoy them. Yet\r\ndespite the heat, they were willing enough to argue with me when they\r\nlearned that I wished to go into Soviet Russia. Like the young man I\r\ntalked to before, they tried hard to dissuade me. They were full of\r\nforebodings.\r\n\r\n“You will be robbed of the clothes on your back the minute you fall into\r\nthe hands of the Bolshevists,” they insisted.\r\n\r\n“You must be crazy,” said one particularly friendly officer, whose\r\nblonde hair stood straight up from his head so that he looked\r\nperpetually frightened.\r\n\r\n“But I am an American correspondent,” I repeated over and over again,\r\nnot knowing what else to say.\r\n\r\n“So that is it,” said the officer, seeming to understand all at once.\r\nAnd shortly after that the Foreign Office at Riga decided to recommend\r\nthe General Staff that I be permitted to pass the lines. But still they\r\nurged me not to go.\r\n\r\n“You will come back naked if you come back alive,” they shouted to me in\r\nparting.\r\n\r\nI left Riga on a troop train at six o’clock in the evening of September\r\n1, 1919, bound for Red Russia. By noon the following day we had reached\r\na small town, where I disembarked with the soldiers. The front was\r\nfifteen versts away. There the Reds had established themselves, I was\r\ntold, in old German trenches near the town of Levenhoff, 107 versts from\r\nRiga.\r\n\r\nI carried a heavy suitcase, an overcoat and an umbrella, and the thought\r\nof trudging in the wake of the less heavily caparisoned soldiers was\r\ndiscouraging. I accosted a smart young officer with blonde mustaches. He\r\nlistened to me with interest.\r\n\r\n“I am an American correspondent,” I said, “accredited to your\r\nheadquarters.”\r\n\r\nHe glanced at my papers and shrugged his shoulders with such an air of\r\nindifference that I thought he was not going to help me at all. But he\r\ntold me to follow him, and a short distance up the road we came upon a\r\npeasant driving a crude hay-rick drawn by a single gaunt horse.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief parley, none of which I understood, the peasant got down\r\nfrom his high seat, hoisted my suitcase into the vehicle, and I followed\r\nit. I sat flat on the floor with my feet braced against the sides of the\r\nspringless cart, and we started jolting and bumping down the rough road\r\nwhich ran parallel with the tracks. The peasant sat on a board laid\r\nacross the front of the rick.\r\n\r\nWe had gone only a short way when the booming of guns came from both\r\nsides of us. My driver, however, seemed unconscious of it. We went on\r\nfor another five versts. The guns grew louder and I saw shrapnel shells\r\nburst uncomfortably near. They came thicker and faster.\r\n\r\nI remembered the peace of Riga some twenty-four hours before this. I\r\nwanted to tell the driver to turn around and go back, and then I\r\nremembered that we did not speak the same language, and certainly,\r\njudging from his impassive back, we were not thinking the same thoughts.\r\nThere was an instant when I stopped thinking altogether, and when I knew\r\nthat I could not have opened my mouth had I tried to speak. A shell\r\nburst some forty feet away and a piece of shrapnel about the size of a\r\ngrape-fruit landed on the floor of the hay-rick between my outspread\r\nlegs, broke two slats on the floor of the wagon and dropped harmlessly\r\nto the ground. Then at last the driver turned around, his face white as\r\nchalk. His panic, instead of communicating itself to me, had the very\r\nopposite effect and I suddenly lost all sense of danger. With a\r\nboldness, which surprises me whenever I think of it, I shouted to him:\r\n\r\n“For Christ’s sake, go on!”\r\n\r\nThe driver obeyed reluctantly but soon turned around again.\r\n\r\n“Go on!” I cried.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later we approached a clump of trees under which stood a\r\nLettish gun, surrounded by four or five officers. My driver stopped to\r\ntalk to them, evidently inquiring whether it was safe to go on. One of\r\nthe officers nodded, the others laughed, and one said in good English,\r\n“Everything is all right.”\r\n\r\nAt four o’clock we reached the headquarters at the front. I presented my\r\npass to the commanding officer, a stocky young fellow with humorous\r\nwrinkles around his eyes.\r\n\r\n“You are an American,” he said, observing me keenly.\r\n\r\n“From New York,” I said. “I am going to Moscow on important business for\r\nmy paper.” I told him more, giving most impressive details. I convinced\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n“Well,” he said finally, “you will have to wait until morning. Both of\r\nus are using heavy artillery now.”\r\n\r\nI insisted. I wanted to go at once.\r\n\r\n“Well, go then,” he said with his first show of impatience. He called a\r\nlieutenant, gave him brief instructions and washed his hands of me.\r\n\r\nRight across the neutral zone you could see the Bolshevist trenches,\r\nrunning at right angles to the railroad with barbed wire on each side so\r\nthat a motor train couldn’t rush through. “You can’t go into the front\r\nline trenches,” the commanding officer told me. “Nobody is allowed in\r\nthere except military men, but you can go through the opening in the\r\nbarbed wire and start across.” That was the best I could do, so the\r\nlieutenant took me around those barbed wires and down into a ditch at\r\nthe edge of the railroad and pointed to me to climb the bank. Well, I\r\nclimbed up somehow, it was about twenty-five feet; and started down that\r\ntrack with my big suitcase and a heavy overcoat on, holding up my\r\numbrella with a white handkerchief tied to it.\r\n\r\nIt was a very hot day and I had to walk two miles across the neutral\r\nzone—two miles right straight down the tracks. You could see the\r\nBolshevist trenches in the distance. Pretty soon the firing started. I\r\ncouldn’t feel anything dropping near me, so I decided those Lettish\r\nsoldiers were popping their heads out of the trenches to see this fool\r\ngo across and the Bolshevists were taking pot shots at them.\r\n\r\nThe Lettish officer had told me: “If they start to fire on you, roll off\r\ndown the bank and crawl back to our positions.” But I would have had to\r\nroll twenty-five feet and probably crawl a mile. So I kept on. A\r\nscattering rifle fire spat out from the Red trenches and the shells\r\nscreamed steadily overhead. My suitcase dragged heavily and I was\r\nuncomfortably warm, but I made good progress. I had covered about half\r\nthe distance when a rifle bullet whipped by my ear. I plunged along the\r\ntrack with redoubled speed.\r\n\r\nAs I came within fifty yards of the barbed wire which the Russians had\r\nstrung across the tracks, Red soldiers shouted up at me from their\r\ntrenches and motioned for me to come down into the adjoining field where\r\nthere was a gap in the wire. A few moments later I was in the first-line\r\ntrench of the Red army.\r\n\r\nI was hot and exhausted and still resentful of that shot. I spoke first:\r\n“Why did you shoot at me?” They did not understand, but one of them\r\nevidently knew I was speaking English. He called down the trench to\r\nanother soldier who ran up. He was a tall young Slav, and showed white\r\nteeth in a broad smile as he greeted me in good English.\r\n\r\n“Hello, America,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Why did you shoot at me?” I repeated indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Oh,” he made a deprecatory gesture.\r\n\r\n“One of the comrades made a mistake,” he said. “He shot at you without\r\norders. But you also made a mistake.”\r\n\r\n“What was that?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“You carried a white flag,” he said, grinning. “It should have been\r\nred.”\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n                         WITH THE RED SOLDIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nI asked to be taken to the commanding officer and two soldiers were\r\ndetailed to escort me. One of the “comrades” laid down his rifle and\r\npicking up my suitcase led the way down the trenches; the other\r\nshouldered his rifle and followed close behind me. I kept my eye on the\r\nsuitcase and trudged along.\r\n\r\nThey were both very friendly, and with a great show of their English\r\nbegan talking to me at once.\r\n\r\n“Do you know,” said one of them, “that the dock workers are on strike in\r\nNew York?” And while I was still wondering to myself how Russia, shut\r\noff from all the rest of the world, could have heard this piece of news,\r\nthe other “comrade” burst out:\r\n\r\n“Who is going to win the pennant in the National League?”\r\n\r\n“Where do you learn these things?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“From the bulletins,” he replied briefly. I learned later that the\r\nwireless at Moscow works twenty-four hours a day, and that it grabs from\r\nthe air practically all the news that is wirelessed from America to\r\nEuropean countries. Each morning in Moscow bulletins carrying this\r\ninformation are printed and distributed in the industries, in the\r\npeasant villages and among soldiers.\r\n\r\nFor three versts we walked along the railroad track, and at last reached\r\nthe headquarters at Levenhoff. I was taken to the commanding officer,\r\nwho spoke English fairly well.\r\n\r\n“What do you want here?” he asked looking me over keenly.\r\n\r\nI had expected that question and had my answer ready. I knew I would\r\nhave to give an explanation, but what I did not know was that I would\r\nhave to give that explanation over and over again all the way from\r\nLevenhoff to Moscow.\r\n\r\n“I came to look you over,” I said. “In the world outside there are many\r\nconflicting stories about Soviet Russia and I want to see for myself\r\nwhat is going on here. I am not a spy. I should like to be allowed to go\r\nto Petrograd and Moscow and to travel through the country and then\r\nreturn to America and tell what I have seen.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RED ARMY’S INFANTRY DIVISION\r\n  Parading on the Famous Hodinskoe Polie in Moscow.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe Red officer took a long look at me and turned to a telephone. I knew\r\njust enough Russian at that time to get the drift of his conversation.\r\nHe called up the Brigade headquarters and reported that an “Amerikanski”\r\njournalist had come across the lines and wanted to proceed into the\r\ncountry. There was much conversation while I stood waiting nervously.\r\nPresently he hung up the receiver and turning to me said, “You will have\r\nto report to the Brigade Command at Praele.”\r\n\r\n“And is there a train?” I asked when I learned that I had twenty-two\r\nmore versts to go to Praele. There was not; I must drive there in a\r\ndroshky. It would be ready for me in a few minutes. And the officer gave\r\nsome orders. Presently the droshky arrived and a great powerful Red\r\nGuard with a rifle slung over his shoulder motioned to me to get in. He\r\nclimbed in after me and we drove off.\r\n\r\nIt was early evening by now. Vast stretches of country swept away from\r\nus on either side of the road. I tried to talk to my burly guard, but\r\nhis English was as meager as my Russian. Our conversation resolved\r\nitself into wild gestures and signs. The night was clear, brightly\r\nmoonlit, and about nine o’clock it grew very cold. The chill crept into\r\nevery crevice of my clothing and penetrated to my very bones, and I lost\r\nall interest in the country around us.\r\n\r\nFor hours we seemed to drive through the chill and dampness. I was\r\nfairly frozen when I realized that the guard suddenly took off his coat\r\nand silently offered it to me. I refused to take it, of course, thanking\r\nhim—“Spasiba, Tovarishch!” I said. He chuckled at my Russian and\r\nrepeated Tovarishch, the Russian word for comrade.\r\n\r\nWe reached Praele at midnight. My guard took a receipt for me from the\r\ncommanding officer as though I were a bundle of clothes or a package of\r\ngroceries, and returned to Levenhoff....\r\n\r\n“What do you want here?”\r\n\r\nI delivered my speech of explanation. The next question was welcome.\r\n“Would you like something to eat before you sleep?” I was very hungry.\r\nThe officer called a soldier who went out and returned with some black\r\nbread and tea, with apple sauce. When I had finished eating, my guard\r\ntook me to a large barrack room where about thirty soldiers were\r\nsleeping in their uniforms on wooden bunks built in around the walls.\r\nSeveral of them woke when we came in and looked me over with interest.\r\nThey passed cigarettes and apples. We smoked and munched for awhile\r\ntogether, and presently every one settled down to sleep.\r\n\r\nI awoke about nine the next morning. The soldiers were all up and gone.\r\nA guard came in and led me to a building across the street where three\r\nofficers and two privates were breakfasting together. A pleasant-faced\r\nRussian woman presided over the stove. A place was made for me at the\r\ntable and I was served with a very unsavory coffee-colored liquid, one\r\negg, a small piece of butter, and plenty of black bread. While we ate a\r\nyoung Russian boy about thirteen years old played the violin,—the\r\n_Internationale_, the _Marseillaise_, and some charming folk-songs.\r\n\r\nWe returned to the barracks after breakfast and a little later the\r\nCommissar attached to brigade headquarters came in to see me. He could\r\nnot speak English, so we carried on our conversation through the\r\nCommandant. First of all he asked what I wanted in Soviet Russia. I went\r\nthrough my patter and they left me. For half an hour I sat wondering\r\nwhat would happen next. Then the Commandant returned.\r\n\r\n“We believe you are telling the truth,” he said. “We are glad to have\r\npeople come in from the outside to learn what we are doing and what we\r\nhope to do under Soviet rule. But some whom we have allowed to come in\r\nhave gone out and told outrageous lies about our country and our people;\r\nothers have come across our lines and have gone away and revealed our\r\nmilitary positions to the enemy. We are defending ourselves and must be\r\ncareful. You must pass on to the Division Command at Rejistza, thence to\r\nArmy Headquarters, and finally to the High Command for investigation.\r\nAfter that you will be allowed to remain in Soviet Russia—or you will be\r\ndeported.”\r\n\r\nThat evening I was taken under guard across country to a small railway\r\nstation where we caught a train which brought us to Rejistza at four\r\no’clock in the morning. A bed was found for me in the station master’s\r\nhouse. At eight o’clock my guard woke me and dragged me off to the\r\nCommissar and the military Commandant at Division Headquarters, turned\r\nme over to them and took a receipt for me delivered in good order.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast of black bread and tea came the question, “What do you\r\nwant here?” I was told that I would have to wait till the following day\r\nfor a decision on my case. Meanwhile I could walk about and see the\r\ntown. The Commandant filled out a slip of paper which he told me I was\r\nto show to any one who offered to interfere with my stroll.\r\n\r\nI found Rejistza a fair-sized town. The people were going about their\r\nbusiness in normal fashion. They appeared to be in good health and they\r\nwere all well clothed. Many of the shops were closed for lack of wares;\r\nothers were open, though none seemed to have much stock. There was,\r\nhowever, an abundance of fruit in the stalls, and some vegetables. The\r\nstreets were dirty. Carpenters were at work on some of the houses, many\r\nof which were badly out of repair.\r\n\r\nI began looking for some one who could speak English, and soon\r\ndiscovered a young Russian boy who was eager to talk about his town.\r\n\r\n“But why are your streets so dirty?” I asked him.\r\n\r\n“Oh, Rejistza always was a dirty town, but we are cleaning it up now as\r\nfast as possible,” he added with civic pride that was obviously newly\r\nacquired.\r\n\r\nThe streets were full of sturdy, well-clad soldiers moving through to\r\nthe Dvinsk front where the Reds were bringing up reinforcements to stop\r\nthe Polish offensive. Bands were playing and the soldiers marched by in\r\ngood order, with heads erect, singing the _Internationale_.\r\n\r\nI walked down towards the river Dvina. The sun was shining, the air\r\ncrisply cold. A crowd of children came bounding out of a school-house\r\nand scampered towards a large park to enjoy their recess hour. They ran\r\nabout playing games much as children in this country do. One group\r\nquickly marked out a space on the sidewalk with chalk and began skipping\r\nand hopping in and put among the chalked squares. Others played tag and\r\nstill others played hiding games. They were all busy. The teachers had\r\ncome out into the park with the children, and for an hour children and\r\nteachers alike played and talked together in the sunlight. Here or there\r\nsat a teacher on a park bench surrounded by a crowd of alert children\r\nwho hung upon every word as she related Russian fairy tales.\r\n\r\nAnd when the hour was over every one trooped back into the school-room\r\nwith as much ardor as when they came out into the park. I wandered over\r\nto the river, but soon returned to the school-house. I wanted to find\r\nout what a Russian school-room was like.\r\n\r\nI slipped in through the door and took a seat near by. No one took\r\nnotice of me. The teacher continued her talking and the children\r\nlistened with as much interest as they had outside when she was telling\r\nthem of the wonderful deeds of the heroes of folk-lore. For an hour I\r\nsat and listened and then walked away still unnoticed. I returned\r\nthrough the town to the Commissar’s house quite unmolested.\r\n\r\nThat day I dined with the Commissar and four or five of his staff. I had\r\nlooked forward to the meal all day, and was grateful when at last we sat\r\ndown to table. Cabbage soup and a small piece of fish were served to\r\neach of us. The others talked a great deal; I waited for more food, but\r\nnone came, and I went to bed that night with a great gnawing inside of\r\nme.\r\n\r\nI was awakened at four o’clock in the morning by a new guard who led me\r\noff to a train. The decision had been made, as the Commandant had\r\npromised it would be. The train was bound for Velikie Luki. The new\r\nguard and I had breakfast on board—black bread and two apples.\r\n\r\nIt was four in the afternoon when we reached our destination. A droshky\r\ncarried us five versts to the headquarters of the 15th Army, where I was\r\nagain delivered into the hands of a Commissar.\r\n\r\nWearily I repeated my lines, thinking much more about the possibility of\r\ngetting a meal from this Commissar than I did about getting a pass into\r\nMoscow. I must have looked as hungry and tired as I felt, for the\r\nCommissar instead of granting the pass took me to his home, which was\r\nonly a short way down the street.\r\n\r\nHis house seemed to me to be the most comfortable place I had ever seen.\r\nI was introduced to his wife, who came to meet us at the door. Two\r\nchildren soon appeared and then the Commissar’s mother, and at once we\r\nbegan talking like old friends. I was taken to a cheerful room where I\r\ndusted and washed myself, and when I returned to the others the evening\r\nmeal was set forth on the table. It seemed almost bountiful to me after\r\nthe meager portions of cabbage soup and black bread I had been eating\r\nfor the past few days. Actually it was only cabbage soup again, one fish\r\nball for each, some kasha, black bread and tea. I ate ravenously, and I\r\nam afraid I gave my host and hostess the impression that I was a\r\nglutton.\r\n\r\nI went to bed early that night feeling well fed for the first time in\r\ndays. In the morning I set forth early for headquarters with the\r\nCommissar and there was turned over to a guard, who took me out to show\r\nme Velikie Luki.\r\n\r\nThe town was crowded with soldiers strolling idly along the streets,\r\nsoldiers marching briskly to the railroad station, soldiers falling in\r\nand out of barracks, soldiers everywhere,—and singing, always singing,\r\nwith bands and without, ceaselessly singing their beloved\r\n_Internationale_. The troops were moving out to the Dvinsk and Denikin\r\nfronts. The thoroughfares were crowded with civilians watching the\r\nregiments pass by—men, women, and children, shouting, waving caps and\r\nhandkerchiefs, and joining in the chorus of the soldiers’ song.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  TROTZKY\r\n  Commissar of War and Marine\r\n]\r\n\r\nI followed the marching lines to the railway station. Trains were\r\npulling out and empty cars moving in as fast as they could be loaded.\r\nAnd how they were loaded! Passenger cars, box cars, flat cars, jammed\r\nwith shouting, laughing soldiers, waving good-bye, joking and singing.\r\nEvery inch of space carried a soldier. Platforms, steps, roofs, and even\r\nthe engines were covered with scrambling, good-natured Reds. A train\r\nalready filled drew in and emptied a load of men back from the front for\r\na rest. The wounded were carried off carefully. From the end of the\r\ntrain a detachment of about two hundred disarmed soldiers marched up the\r\nplatform under guard. These were the first prisoners I had encountered,\r\nand I was anxious to see what would be done with them. They marched away\r\nfrom the station and I asked my guard if we might follow them. He made\r\nno objection. The townspeople paid no attention to the prisoners.\r\nEvidently they were an accustomed sight.\r\n\r\nThey went about a mile down a long side street, parallel to the\r\nrailroad, and then turned abruptly across lots and entered a large\r\nbarrack. A sentry was posted outside, but after a little explanation my\r\nguard obtained permission for us to go in. The prisoners were seated on\r\nthe floor, with their backs to the wall. Two soldiers brought in\r\nsteaming samovars through a side door and others carried in great loaves\r\nof bread. Tea was made and handed around to the prisoners and the bread\r\nwas cut in large chunks and given to them. The captives ate hungrily,\r\ntheir guards chatting and laughing with them. While they were still\r\neating, two more Red soldiers entered, with bundles of printed\r\npamphlets, which they distributed among the prisoners, who ate, drank,\r\nand read.\r\n\r\nIf there was a German soldier there, he received German literature; if a\r\nLithuanian, he received Lithuanian literature; if he happened to be\r\nFrench—well, they had it in all languages. All the while they were\r\nholding the prisoners they fed them three times a day, sometimes bread\r\nand tea and sometimes cabbage soup, _and they kept them reading all the\r\ntime_; when they were not reading some of the Commissars were in there\r\ntalking with them, telling them about the world, and what the war was\r\nabout and why they were sent there. They had the organization of it\r\nperfected to such an extent that prisoners were not there five minutes\r\nbefore they were eating, and they were not eating five minutes before\r\nthey were reading.\r\n\r\nBolshevist warfare does not end with the taking of prisoners. The\r\npropaganda follows. The Soviet leaders think more of it than they do of\r\nbullets. They say it is more effective. Three times on the western front\r\nI witnessed this same scene where prisoners were brought in.\r\n\r\nIn Russia they like very much to take prisoners. The only objection is\r\nthat they haven’t got much food and they don’t like to starve them. They\r\ntold me that they would like to take a million prisoners a day, if they\r\nhad plenty of food and paper. After all, the biggest war they were\r\ncarrying on in Russia was a war of education. All along the battle-front\r\nyou could see streamers telling the other side what the thing was\r\nabout—you could read them a hundred yards away. At night they put two\r\nposts in the ground and fastened the streamer between them. In the\r\nmorning, when the sun rose, there it was.\r\n\r\nDuring the two days I spent in Velikie Luki, and later at many other\r\nplaces along the front, I sought every opportunity to study the Red\r\narmy. I am not an expert and cannot report upon the technical details of\r\nmilitary equipment. There seemed no lack of small arms or cannon. In\r\ngeneral the soldiers were warmly clad and strongly shod. Certainly they\r\nwere in good spirits. The relations between officers and men were\r\ninteresting. There was no lack of discipline. Off duty all ranks mingled\r\nas comrades, men and officers joking, laughing, singing, or talking\r\nseriously together. Under orders the men obeyed promptly. I found it the\r\nsame at the front, in the barracks, and at headquarters with the\r\nCommissars and highest officers. When there was no serious work to be\r\ndone they associated without distinction.\r\n\r\nWherever I met the Red soldiers I was struck with this combination of\r\ncomradeship and discipline. On more than one occasion I have gone into a\r\ncommandant’s office along the front, at some high command, and found him\r\nplaying cards or checkers with his men. Privates and under-officers\r\nwould crowd in unceremoniously and engage in voluble chatter without the\r\nslightest indication of superiority or deference to rank. Then,\r\nsuddenly, perhaps a ring on the telephone, and the commander would\r\nreceive a report of some development along the front. A brisk order\r\nwould bring the room to attentive silence; cards and checkerboards and\r\nfiddles would be shoved aside. The men would file out to their posts.\r\nThey seemed to have an instant appreciation of the distinction between\r\ncomradeship in the barracks and discipline on duty.\r\n\r\n                              THE RED ARMY\r\n\r\nThe ordinary Red soldier gets 400 rubles a month, with rations and\r\nclothes. Soviet officials told me that there were 2,000,000 thoroughly\r\ntrained and equipped men in the fighting forces, with another million in\r\nreserve and under training. About 50,000 young officers, they said,\r\nchosen from the most capable peasants and workers, had already graduated\r\nfrom the officers’ training schools under the Soviet Government.\r\nThousands of others had been developed from the ranks.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for the casual observer to misjudge that subtle and\r\nall-important element known as “morale.” I think that I am perhaps more\r\nthan ordinarily skeptical of manifestations of patriotic fervor, knowing\r\nsomething of the means by which every general staff keeps up the\r\nfighting spirit of the ranks. But I retain from my contact with the Red\r\nsoldiers a sense of peculiar zeal and dogged grit. Certainly they do not\r\nwant to fight. They want to go home and settle down in peace. But this\r\nfrankly confessed distaste for slaughter seems only to emphasize their\r\ndetermination to see the struggle through to the end. For all their war\r\nweariness they did not act like men driven unwillingly into battle. I\r\ntried to imagine myself enduring what many of them have endured for over\r\nfive years, betrayed by their first leaders, overwhelmingly defeated by\r\ntheir first enemy, and still struggling on against new assaults from\r\nthose they had been taught to believe were their friends and allies.\r\n\r\nI tried to imagine what vast process of propaganda could have stimulated\r\nthis unyielding endurance. Propaganda there undoubtedly was. Just as the\r\nAllied armies had their attendant organizations of welfare workers and\r\nentertainers to keep up the morale, so the Red Army was accompanied by a\r\ncarefully organized system of revolutionary propaganda. I suppose the\r\nAmerican soldier would not have fought so well had he not been\r\nconstantly reminded that he was fighting to make the world safe for\r\nDemocracy. The Red soldier is persuaded that he fights to keep Russia\r\nsafe for the Revolution. This ideal is deeply personal. He feels it is\r\nhis revolution; he feels that he accomplished it regardless of his\r\nleaders, certainly in spite of some of them; and now it is his to defend\r\nagainst attacks from without and within. In judging this thing I find\r\nmyself turning away from generalizations and disregarding what I was\r\ntold by those enthusiasts who have the Red Army in their keeping. I come\r\nback again and again to the men themselves. Before I left Russia I had\r\nseen a great many soldiers. I had lived with them, traveled with them,\r\nslept in their barracks, eaten in their mess. To the American of course,\r\nthe conditions under which the European masses manage to maintain\r\nexistence, even in normal times, is always a matter of surprise and\r\nwonder. The Soviet Government does everything possible for the Red Army.\r\nIt is their constant thought and care. But the utmost that can be\r\nprovided, even of bare subsistence, seems painfully inadequate to the\r\nwesterner.\r\n\r\nThe preferential treatment of the soldiers, of which I had heard so much\r\nbefore I saw it and shared it, consists principally in maintaining an\r\nuninterrupted supply of black bread and tea. It may be propaganda, it\r\nmay be a peculiar quality in the spiritual and physical composition of\r\nthe Russian peasant. Whatever it is, I do not believe that any other\r\nEuropean army would endure so long on a ration of black bread and tea.\r\nAn occasional apple or cigarette were luxuries, all too quickly consumed\r\nand forgotten. The black bread and tea, constant and unvaried, will ever\r\nremain for me the symbol both of the efficiency of the Soviet Commissary\r\nand of the zeal of the Red soldier. Black bread and tea and song. Their\r\nlove for song is amazing,—all songs, but principally the\r\n_Internationale_. They march off to the front singing, they limp back\r\nfrom battle singing, they sing on the trains, and in the barracks, and\r\nat mess; they sing while they are playing checkers and they sing while\r\nthey are sweeping stables. They wake up at night and sing. I have heard\r\nthem do it.\r\n\r\nI was told that about seventy-five percent of the Czar’s officers were\r\nin the Soviet Army. This was no sign that they were converted to\r\ncommunism. Their spirit remained essentially patriotic. They supported\r\nthe Soviet Government, not because it was a Socialist government, but\r\nbecause it was _the_ government. They fought to defend Russia.\r\n\r\nIt was Trotzky who insisted on allowing these old officers to come into\r\nthe army. Many of the Communists thought they would betray the soldiers\r\non the front and turn them over to the enemy. But Trotzky said it was a\r\nquestion of permitting the experienced officers to train the men and\r\nteach them military tactics or the Red Army would be destroyed. Trotzky\r\nhad his way. At every army post, whether it was a company, a brigade, a\r\nregiment or a division, wherever there was an old army officer there was\r\na trusted Commissar who worked in the office, and every move the old\r\narmy officer made was known to the Commissar.\r\n\r\nThe following manifesto, drawn up and signed by 137 officers of the old\r\nrégime, appealing to their former messmates to quit the\r\ncounter-revolution and stop making war upon the Soviet Government, which\r\nthe people had established and would defend against all attacks, was\r\nsent through the Denikin lines:\r\n\r\n\"Officers—Comrades:\r\n\r\n\"We address this letter to you with the intention of avoiding useless\r\nand aimless shedding of blood. We know quite well that the army of\r\nGeneral Denikin will be crushed, as was that of Kolchak and of many\r\nothers who have tried to put at their mercy a working people of many\r\nmillions of men. We know equally well that truth and justice are on the\r\nside of the Red Army, and that you only remain in the ranks of the White\r\nArmy through ignorance regarding the Soviet Republic and the Red Army,\r\nor because you fear for your fate in case of the latter’s victory. We\r\nthink it our duty above all to write you the truth about the position\r\nmade for us in the Red Army. First we guarantee to you that no officers\r\nof the White Army passing over into our camp are shot. That is the order\r\nof the Supreme Revolutionary Council of War.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LENIN AND MRS. LENIN, MOSCOW, 1919]\r\n\r\n\"If you come with the simple desire to lessen the sufferings of the\r\nworking population, to lessen the shedding of blood, nobody will touch\r\nyou. As to officers who express the desire to serve loyally in the Red\r\nArmy they are received with respect and extreme courtesy. We have not to\r\nsubmit to any kind of outrage or humiliation. Everywhere our needs are\r\nattentively supplied. Full respect for the work of specialists of every\r\nkind is the fundamental motive of the policy of the present government\r\nand of its authorized representatives in the Red Army. Quite unlike the\r\npractice in the old army, you are not asked, ‘Who are your parents?’ but\r\nonly one thing—‘Are you loyal?’ A loyal officer who is educated and who\r\nworks advances rapidly on the ladder of military administration, is\r\nreceived everywhere with respect, attention, and kindness. Among the\r\ntroops an exemplary discipline has been introduced.\r\n\r\n“From the material point of view we could not be better treated. As for\r\nthe Commissars, in the vast majority of cases we work hand in hand with\r\nthem, and in case of disagreement the most highly authorized\r\nrepresentatives of the power of the Soviets take rapidly decisive\r\nmeasures for getting rid of the differences. In a word, the longer we\r\nserve in the Red Army, the more we are convinced that service is not a\r\nburden to us. Many of us began to serve with a little sinking of the\r\nheart, solely to earn a living, but the longer our service has lasted\r\nthe more we are convinced of the possibility of loyal and conscientious\r\nservice in this army. That is why, officer comrades, we allow ourselves\r\nto call you such although we know that the word ‘comrade’ is considered\r\ninsulting among you, because among us it indicates relations of simple\r\ncordiality and mutual respect. Without proposing that you should make\r\nany decision, we beg you to examine the question, and in your future\r\nconduct to take account of our evidence. We wish to say one thing\r\nmore,—we congratulate ourselves that in fulfilling obligations loyally\r\nwe are not the servants of any foreign government. We are glad to serve\r\nneither German imperialism, nor the imperialism which is\r\nAnglo-Franco-American. We do what our conscience dictates to us in the\r\ninterest of millions and millions of workers, to which number the vast\r\nmajority of the company of the officers belong.”\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n                              ON TO MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Velikie Luki I wandered with my guard down a street of\r\nthe town and came upon a Soviet bookstore. Inside were thousands of\r\nbooks and pamphlets, in what seemed to me all the languages of the\r\nworld. The store was full of men and women buying these books and\r\npamphlets. I learned that this store and many others like it had been\r\nopened almost two years before, and that knowledge of history and social\r\nconditions throughout the world was thus being brought to millions of\r\nRussians formerly held in darkness.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon of that day the Commissar informed me that I was\r\nfree to go on to Smolensk and that if I passed muster there I could go\r\nanywhere I desired in Russia. I was given another guard, a big fellow\r\nwho had spent ten years in England and returned to Russia when the Czar\r\nwas overthrown. He so much resembled the Irish labor leader, Jim Larkin,\r\nthat I called him “Larkin” throughout the course of our journey\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nHe had an exclamation which he used frequently when I was too\r\npertinacious to suit him.\r\n\r\n“God love a duck, what do you want now?” he would roar with a despairing\r\ngesture, and the tone of his voice also was despairing. It may be that\r\nhe was justified in his complaint, for there was much that I wanted to\r\nknow and to see.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of our journey towards Moscow he turned to me and said,\r\n“I haven’t prayed for ten years or more,—not since I was down and out in\r\nGlasgow, Scotland, and wandered into a Salvation Army headquarters. Then\r\nI did go down on my knees and pray for help, but I decided since that\r\npraying wasn’t my job. But God love a duck, when I get you safely into\r\nMoscow I’m going down on my knees again and thank God that this job is\r\nover and ask Him to save me from any more Americans of your kind.”\r\n\r\nBut there was, after all, some excuse for my troubling him so often and\r\nso much. “Larkin” slept on every possible—and impossible—occasion, and\r\nthe sound of his snores, with which I can think of nothing worthy of\r\ncomparison, kept me awake, so that in self-defence I used to rouse him\r\nevery time we reached a station to ask questions about where we were and\r\nwhy we had stopped there and what the people were doing and why they\r\nwere doing it. When I had him sufficiently awake to begin to smoke I\r\ncould snatch a bit of sleep for myself, for he invariably sat up until\r\nhe had smoked eight or ten cigarettes, after which his snoring began\r\nagain and my rest ended.\r\n\r\n“Larkin’s” real name was August Grafman, which sounded Teutonic. He was\r\na Russian Jew, however, and a good fellow. I hope to see him again\r\nsometime, and I commend him to any other Americans who want to see for\r\nthemselves what is going on in Russia at the present time. He spoke\r\nEnglish readily and perfectly, and from him I obtained much information\r\nI might otherwise have missed. There was the time when we waited for a\r\ntrain at a small station in the course of our journey towards Smolensk.\r\nAll at once a commotion arose on the other side of the station. Hurrying\r\naround, we saw a man running, pursued by three or four Red soldiers. Two\r\nofficers coming toward the station drew their sabres and held them\r\nbefore the man, who stopped and his pursuers captured him. They brought\r\nhim back to the station and I observed that he was a Jew. I wondered if\r\nhis crime was that of his race, remembering stories of pogroms. The Jew\r\nwas brought into the station and seated on a bench. Immediately the\r\nsoldiers surrounded him, and one of them stood up in front of him and\r\nmade a long speech. At its conclusion he sat down, and another rose and\r\nmade an address. Finally a third vociferously questioned the man. At\r\nlast the Jew arose, the soldiers made way for him, and he left the\r\nstation. “Larkin” who had been too much interested in the proceedings to\r\ntalk to me, now satisfied my curiosity.\r\n\r\nThe Jew had been caught in the act of picking the pockets of a soldier.\r\nFurthermore it was his third offence. The first man who spoke had tried\r\nto impress the Jew with the enormity of the crime of robbing a man who\r\nwas on his way to defend his country. He had said, “Don’t you realize\r\nthat a man going out to fight carries nothing with him except what he\r\nactually needs, whether it be money or anything else, and that it is\r\nworse to rob a soldier on this account than an ordinary civilian, with a\r\nhome, and all his treasures about him?” The second man had talked of the\r\ndefence of the country; the soldiers were going to fight so that when\r\nthe fighting ended there would be enough for every one and no need for\r\nstealing. The third had tried to obtain a promise that the man would not\r\nagain steal from soldiers. He had been successful, and, “now the Jew is\r\nfree,” said Larkin.\r\n\r\n“But it was his third offense,” I said. “I should think they would\r\npunish him severely.”\r\n\r\n“Larkin” gave me a pitying glance. “You don’t understand the Russians,”\r\nhe said simply. “They are kind and in their own new born freedom they\r\nwant every one to be free.”\r\n\r\nAt last our train arrived and we got on. To Smolensk and then to Moscow,\r\nI thought. But it was not so simple as that. Our train was going to\r\nMoghilev direct, so we had to get off again at Polotsk at nine in the\r\nevening, where we found that we were half an hour too late to catch the\r\ntrain for Smolensk. “Larkin” hunted around for a sleeping place for us\r\nwhen we learned that we would have to stay overnight in the town, and\r\nfinally won the favor of the Commissar, who took us to what he called\r\nthe “Trainmen’s Hotel,” a large building near the station. In the room\r\ninto which we were ushered there were about twenty beds, the linen on\r\nwhich was far from clean. Two of the beds in one corner of the room were\r\nassigned to us and we lay down fully dressed. After what seemed a few\r\nminutes I was awakened by a vigorous kick, and found a huge Russian\r\nstanding over me, brandishing his arms and speaking harshly and\r\nmenacingly at me. I hurriedly shook “Larkin” out of his profound\r\nslumber, and at the end of a brief but spirited discussion between the\r\ntwo in Russian, he informed me that the man had been working all night\r\nin the railroad shop and had come in to sleep. He resented finding his\r\nbed occupied. I suspected “Larkin” of enjoying the joke on me, as I\r\nclambered out and shivered in the cold, but his enjoyment was brief, for\r\nhe was almost immediately ordered out by another man who entered and\r\nclaimed his bed.\r\n\r\nThe two of us wandered out forlornly into the cold foggy morning and\r\nwent back to the station. The Commissar there made us comfortable in his\r\noffice until daylight, when we went down the track to a water tank and\r\nhad a “hobo wash” after which we ate our breakfast—one egg each, black\r\nbread and tea, in the Soviet restaurant in the station.\r\n\r\nWe had been told that we could not get a train to Smolensk before four\r\no’clock in the afternoon, but at eleven the Commissar told us that a\r\ntrainload of soldiers going to the Denikin front would be passing\r\nthrough at two in the afternoon and that it might be possible to arrange\r\nfor our transportation on this train, if we wished it. We did wish it\r\nand at two o’clock we were in a box car full of soldiers en route to\r\nSmolensk, which we would reach at ten that night.\r\n\r\nThe soldiers sang all evening—Russian soldiers always sing, no matter\r\nhow crowded, how hungry, or how weary—but one by one they dropped off to\r\nsleep, huddled up in all sorts of positions. The train jolted along,\r\nslowly, it seemed to me, and it was too dark to see anything through the\r\nwindow. My guard went to sleep, and I remember thinking we must be near\r\nSmolensk and that I would have to stay awake since he seemed to find his\r\nresponsibilities resting lightly. The stopping of the train roused me,\r\nand thinking that we had arrived at Smolensk I shook “Larkin” who looked\r\nat his watch and exclaimed, “Why it’s midnight. We must have passed\r\nSmolensk.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LENIN IN THE COURTYARD OF THE KREMLIN, MOSCOW, SUMMER OF\r\n1919]\r\n\r\nSurely enough, we had gone through Smolensk and were seventy five versts\r\non the other side of it, bound for the Denikin front. I had no\r\nobjections to going there eventually but I preferred to have permission\r\nfirst, so we hastily bundled out of the train and went into the station.\r\n“Larkin” approached the door of the Commissar’s office and tried to\r\nbrush past the Red Guard who sat there, and who objected to such an\r\nunceremonious entrance. After an interminable discussion—perhaps five\r\nminutes,—I said, “He wants to see your credentials. Why don’t you show\r\nthem to him? Do you want us both to be arrested?”\r\n\r\nBut the Red guard had lost patience by this time. A snap of his fingers\r\nbrought a policeman who arrested “Larkin” and before I had finished the\r\n“I told you so,” I could not restrain, I found the heavy hand of the law\r\non my own shoulder. The two of us were marched down the street and\r\nlocked in a little dark room in what was apparently the town jail.\r\n\r\nIn the two hours of solitude that followed I shared all my dismal\r\nforebodings with that unfortunate guard. We would be taken for spies and\r\nas spies we would certainly be shot. I couldn’t be sorry that this\r\npenalty would be inflicted upon anyone so stupid and obstinate and\r\ngenerally asinine as he, but I at least wanted to get back to America\r\nand tell people how stupid a big Russian could be. There were probably\r\nsome adjectives also, I am not sure that he listened. In any event I\r\ncould not see the signs of contrition that might at least have lightened\r\nmy apprehensions.\r\n\r\nAt the end of two hours two Red soldiers opened the door of our cell and\r\nescorted us to the police station where we were taken at once before the\r\njudge, a simple, but very determined looking peasant, who examined first\r\nthe Red Guard who had caused our arrest, the policeman who had arrested\r\nus, and two soldiers who had witnessed the affair.\r\n\r\n“Larkin” in the meantime very reluctantly interpreted whatever comments\r\nand explanations I had to make. He became more and more stubborn and\r\ntaciturn. The Red Guard told his story, which was verified by the\r\npoliceman. The two soldiers further attested to the truth of the tale\r\nand stated that we had been entirely at fault. Then the judge asked my\r\nguard for an explanation, and with the air of one playing a forgotten\r\nace which would take trick and game, “Larkin” produced our credentials\r\nand laid them triumphantly on the judge’s desk.\r\n\r\nWhen he had read them the judge rose and made a statement which I\r\ndemanded my guard should translate.\r\n\r\n“Oh he is just saying,” said “Larkin,” “to please tell the American that\r\nwe are sorry this thing happened. We are only working people and we must\r\nbe careful to guard our country. The Red Guard at the door was simply\r\nobeying orders and doing his duty, and we want the American to\r\nunderstand that no deliberate offence was intended. There are so many\r\npeople making war on us, both inside and outside, and we have to be\r\ncareful.”\r\n\r\nWhen “Larkin” had translated my reply, which was to the effect that we\r\nacknowledged our fault, and had only congratulations for the men who\r\nunderstood their duty and had the courage to perform it, and that I\r\nregretted having been the cause of so much trouble, the judge himself\r\nled us to a first-class train coach in the yards, unlocked it, and told\r\nus to enter and spend the rest of the night there.\r\n\r\n“At eight o’clock in the morning this coach will be picked up by the\r\ntrain to Smolensk. Now, go to sleep, you won’t have to be on the watch\r\nthis time,” he said with a suggestion of a smile.\r\n\r\nWeary as I was I still remembered a few more things to say to “Larkin”\r\nwho was by this time somewhat subdued. It was not until I had threatened\r\nto report him to the Moscow Government, and had again told him that it\r\nwas a brutal thing to take advantage of men who were doing their duty\r\nunder the most difficult circumstances conceivable, that my mind was\r\nlightened sufficiently so that I could go to sleep.\r\n\r\nOf one thing I had been convinced—the general efficiency of organization\r\nwhich I had encountered again and again in Soviet Russia. The people\r\nwere universally kind, but with strangers they took no chances. Well, I\r\nconcluded, they could not have been blamed if they had kept us in jail\r\nfor a long while, until they had checked up my entire record in Russia,\r\nat least. And I was grateful that my prison record amounted to two hours\r\nonly, thanks to the expedition with which they administer trial to\r\nsuspects in Red Russia.\r\n\r\nShut up in our coach we sped on to Smolensk the next day. Another\r\ntwenty-four hours in Smolensk, where I was given permission to proceed\r\nto Moscow and again I boarded a train. I had been relayed from one army\r\npost to another; from the company to the regiment, from the regiment to\r\nthe brigade, from the brigade to the division, from the division to the\r\narmy command, and from the army command to the high command. And after\r\neight days I was almost within reach of Moscow. On the morrow I would be\r\noff for Moscow itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LENIN AT HIS DESK IN KREMLIN, 1919]\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n                                 MOSCOW\r\n\r\n\r\nI reached Moscow on Sunday afternoon and was taken at once by “Larkin”\r\nto the Foreign Office at the Metropole hotel. As we drove through the\r\npicturesque town of many churches we passed great numbers of people\r\nenjoying the sunshine. The parks and squares were full of romping\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIn the Foreign Office I was greeted by Litvinoff, who gave me\r\ncredentials which granted me freedom of action—freedom to go where I\r\npleased and without a guard as long as I remained in Soviet Russia; and\r\nCommunist life began for me.\r\n\r\nThe Metropole hotel, like all others in Soviet Russia, had been taken\r\nover by the Government. The rooms not occupied by the Foreign Office\r\nwere used as living rooms by Government employees. The National hotel is\r\nused entirely for Soviet workers, and the beautiful residence in which\r\nMirbach, the German ambassador, was assassinated is now the headquarters\r\nof the Third International.\r\n\r\nNo one was allowed to have more than one meal a day. This consisted of\r\ncabbage soup, a small piece of fish and black bread, and was served at\r\nSoviet restaurants at any time between one o’clock in the afternoon and\r\nseven at night. There were a few old cafés still in existence, run by\r\nprivate speculators, where it was possible to purchase a piece of meat\r\nat times, but the prices were exorbitant. In the Soviet restaurants ten\r\nrubles was charged for the meal, while in the cafés the same kind of\r\nmeal would have cost from 100 to 150 rubles.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet restaurants had been established everywhere, in villages and\r\nsmall towns as well as in cities. In the villages and railway stations\r\nthey were usually in the station building itself or near it. In the\r\ncities they were scattered everywhere, so as to be easily accessible to\r\nthe workers. Some of them were run on the cafeteria plan; in others\r\nwomen carried the food to the tables for the other workers. One entered,\r\nshowed his credentials to prove that he was a worker and was given a\r\nmeal check, for which he paid a fixed sum. Needless to say, there was no\r\ntipping. I had not the courage to experiment by offering a tip to these\r\ndignified, self-respecting women. I think they would have laughed at my\r\n“stupid foreign ways” had I done so.\r\n\r\nThe old café life of Moscow was a thing of the past. If you wished\r\nanything to eat at night you had to purchase bread and tea earlier in\r\nthe day and make tea in your room. This was very simple because the\r\nkitchens in hotels were used exclusively for heating water. At breakfast\r\ntime and all through the evening a stream of people went to the kitchen\r\nwith pails and pitchers for hot water which they carried to their rooms\r\nthemselves where they made their tea and munched black bread. There were\r\nno maids or bell boys to do these errands for you, and the only service\r\nyou got in a hotel was that of a maid who cleaned your room each\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThe working people would buy a pound or two of black bread in the\r\nevening on their way home. They had their samovars on which they made\r\ntea, and if they felt so inclined ate in the evening. For breakfast they\r\nagain had tea and black bread like every one else. As a result of this\r\ndiet hundreds of thousands of people were suffering from malnutrition.\r\nThe bulk of the people in the city were hungry all the time.\r\n\r\nI found the tramway service,—reduced fifty percent because of the lack\r\nof fuel,—miserably inadequate for the needs of the population which had\r\ngreatly increased since Moscow became the capital. The citizens in their\r\nnecessity have developed the most extraordinary propensities in\r\nstep-clinging. They swarm on the platforms and stand on one another’s\r\nfeet with the greatest good nature, and then, when there isn’t room to\r\nwedge in another boot, the late-comers cling to the bodies of those who\r\nhave been lucky enough to get a foothold, and still others cling to\r\nthese, until the overhanging mass reaches half-way to the curb. I tried\r\nit once myself—and walked thereafter. There were not many automobiles to\r\nbe seen. The Government had requisitioned all cars. The motors were run\r\nby coal oil and alcohol, and the Government had very little of these.\r\n\r\nDuring my second day in Moscow I met some English prisoners walking\r\nquite freely in the streets. I went up to a group of three and told them\r\nI was an American, and asked how they were getting on. They said they\r\nwanted to go home because the food was scarce, but aside from the lack\r\nof food they had nothing to complain of.\r\n\r\n“Of course food is scarce,” said one, “but we get just as much as anyone\r\nelse. Nobody gets much. You see us walking about the streets. No one is\r\nfollowing us. We are free to go where we please. They send us to the\r\ntheatre three nights a week. We go to the opera and the ballet. That’s\r\nwhat they do with all prisoners.”\r\n\r\nAnother broke in enthusiastically to say that if there were only food\r\nenough he would be glad to stay in Russia. Several of their pals, they\r\ntold me, were working in Soviet offices.\r\n\r\nThey belonged to a detachment of ninety English who had been captured\r\nsix months before, on the Archangel front. Before they went into action,\r\nthey said, their commanding officer told each one to carry a hand\r\ngrenade in his pocket, and if taken prisoner to blow off his head.\r\n\r\n“The Bolsheviki,” he told us, \"would torture us—first they would cut off\r\na finger, then an ear, then the tip of the nose, and they would keep\r\nstripping us and torturing us until we died twenty-one days later.\r\n\r\n“Well, before we knew it the Bolsheviki had us surrounded. There was\r\nnothing to do but surrender—and none of us used his bomb. The Bolsheviks\r\nmarched us back about ten miles to a barrack, where we were told to sit\r\ndown. Pretty soon they brought in a samovar and gave us tea and bread,\r\nand when we were about half through eating they brought in bundles of\r\npamphlets. The pamphlets were all printed in English, mind you, and they\r\ntold us why we had been sent to Russia.”\r\n\r\nI recognized in his description the thing I had seen myself on the\r\nWestern Front a few days before. I asked him if that was the usual way\r\nof treating prisoners.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said, “that’s the way they do it. They don’t kill you. They\r\njust feed you with tea and bread, and this—what they call on the outside\r\n‘propaganda’ and they say to you, ‘you read this stuff for a week,’ and\r\nyou do, and you believe it—you can’t help it.”\r\n\r\nIt was bitterly cold in Moscow, though the Bolshevists made light of the\r\nSeptember weather and laughed at my complaints. “Stay the winter with\r\nus,” they said, “and you will learn what cold is.” The city was\r\npractically without heat. The chill and damp entered my bones and\r\npursued me through the streets and into my bed at night. One can stand\r\nprolonged exposure and cold if there is only the sustaining thought of a\r\nglowing fire somewhere, and a warm bed. But in Moscow there was no\r\nrespite from the relentless chill. One was cold all day and all night.\r\nThe aching pinch of it tore at the nerves. I marvelled at the endurance\r\nof the undernourished clerks and officials in the great damp Government\r\noffice buildings, where it was often colder than in the dry sunshine\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nAll the large department stores and the clothing and shoe shops had been\r\ntaken over by the Government. Here and there, however, were small\r\nprivate shops, selling goods without regard to Government prices.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet stores were arranged much like our large department stores.\r\nOne could go in and buy various commodities, shoes in one department,\r\nclothing in another, and so on. Soviet employees had the right at all\r\ntimes to purchase in these stores at Soviet prices. They carried\r\ncredentials showing they were giving useful service to the Government.\r\nWithout credentials one could buy nothing—not even food—except from the\r\nprivately-owned shops.\r\n\r\nTo these the peasant speculators would bring home-made bread in sacks\r\nand sell it to the shop speculators, who in turn demanded as much as\r\neighty rubles a pound. This was the only way of getting bread without\r\ncredentials because the Government had taken control of the bakeries. In\r\na Soviet store a pound of bread could be bought for ten rubles.\r\n\r\nAll unnecessary labor in Soviet stores had been eliminated. Young girls\r\nand women acted as clerks; very few men were employed in any capacity.\r\nThe manager, who usually was to be found on the first floor, was a man,\r\nand he directed customers to the departments which sold the things they\r\nwished to purchase. The elevators were running not only in the stores,\r\nbut in the office buildings.\r\n\r\nWhite collars and white shirts could be bought in some stores, but they\r\nwere rationed so that it would have been impossible to buy three or four\r\nshirts at one time. The windows in the stores were filled with articles,\r\nbut there was no attempt to display goods, and there was no advertising.\r\n\r\nA shine, a shave and a hair-cut were obtainable at the Soviet barber\r\nshops. They were not rationed; one could buy as many of these as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nTheatres and operas were open and largely attended in Moscow, and the\r\nactors and actresses, as well as the singers, did not seem to mind the\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nThe streets were but dimly lighted, because of the fuel shortage, but I\r\nsaw and heard of no crimes being committed. I wandered about the city\r\nthrough many of its darkest streets, at all hours of the night, and was\r\nnever molested. Now and then a policeman demanded my permit, which, when\r\nI had shown it, was accepted without question. The city was well\r\npoliced, the streets fairly clean, and the government was doing\r\neverything possible to prevent disease. Orders were issued that all\r\nwater must be boiled, but as all Russians drink tea this order was not\r\nunusual or difficult to carry out.\r\n\r\nThe telephone and telegraph systems seemed to me unusually good.\r\nConnections by telephone between Moscow and Petrograd were obtained in\r\ntwo minutes. Local service was prompt and efficient, and connections\r\nwith wrong numbers were of rare occurrence.\r\n\r\nMany newspapers were being published, the size of all being limited on\r\naccount of the shortage of paper. In addition to the Government\r\nnewspapers and the Bolshevist party papers there were papers of opposing\r\nparties, notably publications controlled by the Menshevists and the\r\nSocial Revolutionists.\r\n\r\nAll of them were free from the advertising of business firms, since the\r\nGovernment had nationalized all trade. Of course there was no “funny\r\npage” or “Women’s Section.”\r\n\r\nAs soon as news came from the front great bulletins were distributed\r\nthrough the city and posted on the walls of buildings where every one\r\ncould read them. These bulletins contained the news of both defeat and\r\nvictory. If prisoners had been taken or a retreat had been necessary,\r\nthe populace was informed of it frankly. There was no attempt to keep up\r\nthe “morale” of the civilian population by assuring it that all went\r\nwell and that victory was certain. Any one in Soviet Russia who accepted\r\nthe responsibilities of the new order did so knowing that it meant\r\nhardship and defeat—for a time.\r\n\r\nIn Moscow many statues have been erected since the revolution. Skobileff\r\nSquare,—now called Soviet Square,—has a statue of Liberty which takes\r\nthe place of the old statue of Skobileff. I saw sculptors at work all\r\nover the city, putting in medallions and bas-reliefs, on public\r\nbuildings. In Red Square, along the Kremlin wall, are the graves of many\r\nwho fell in the revolution. Sverdlov, formerly president of the\r\nexecutive committee, and a close friend of Lenin, is buried here. I was\r\ntold that his death had been a great loss to the Soviet Government.\r\n\r\nMoscow, like all the other Russian cities I saw, had schools everywhere,\r\nart schools, musical conservatories, technical schools, in addition to\r\nthe regular schools for children.\r\n\r\nOn “Speculator’s Street” in Moscow all kinds of private trading went on\r\nwithout interference. I found this street thronged with shoppers and\r\nwith members of the old bourgeoisie selling their belongings along the\r\ncurb; men and women unmistakably of the former privileged classes\r\noffering, dress suits, opera cloaks, evening gowns, shoes, hats, and\r\njewelry to any one who would pay them the rubles that they, in turn,\r\nmust give to the exorbitant speculators for the very necessities of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nThese irreconcilables of the old regime, unwilling to cooperate with the\r\nnew government and refusing to engage in useful work which would entitle\r\nthem to purchase their supplies at the Soviet shops, at Soviet prices,\r\nwere compelled to resort to the speculators and under pressure of the\r\nconstantly decreasing ruble and the wildly soaring prices, were driven\r\nto sacrifice their valuables in order to avoid starvation. Any one who\r\ndesired and who had the money could buy from the speculators; but one\r\npays dearly for pride in Soviet Russia. The speculators charged\r\nseventy-five rubles a pound for black bread that could be bought in the\r\nGovernment shops for ten rubles. The right to buy at the Soviet shops\r\nand to eat in the Soviet restaurants was to be had by the mere\r\ndemonstration of a sincere desire to do useful work of hand or brain.\r\nNevertheless these defenders of the old order still held out—fewer of\r\nthem every day, to be sure—and the speculators throve accordingly.\r\n\r\nIt seemed at first glance a strange anomaly. I could see through the\r\nwindows of the speculator’s shops canned goods and luxuries, and even\r\nnecessities, for which the majority of the population were suffering. I\r\nasked why the Government did not put its principles into practice by\r\nrequisitioning all these stocks and ending the speculation. There were\r\nmany things in their program, the Bolshevists said, which could not be\r\ncarried out at once because the energy of the Government was consumed in\r\nthe mobilization of all available resources for national defence. There\r\nwere thousands of speculators all over Russia, and it would take a small\r\narmy to eliminate them entirely. Half measures would only drive them\r\nunderground where they would be a constant source of irritation and\r\nanti-Government propaganda. It was better to let them operate in the\r\nopen, they said, where they could be kept under observation and\r\nrestrained within certain limits.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the speculators were eliminating themselves and dragging with\r\nthem the recalcitrant bourgeoisie on whom they preyed. Hoarded wealth\r\nand old finery do not last forever. As the ruble falls and the\r\nspeculator’s prices rise their victims are compelled to sacrifice more\r\nand more of their dwindling resources. The Government prices are a\r\nstanding temptation to reconciliation. Only the obdurate bourgeoisie and\r\nthe speculators suffer from the depreciation of the ruble. Every two\r\nmonths wages are adjusted to meet depreciation, by a Government\r\ncommission which acts in conjunction with the Central Federation of All\r\nRussian Professional Alliances, representing skilled and unskilled\r\nlabor. This serves to stabilize the purchasing power of the workers\r\nearnings, although in the past unavoidable and absolute dearth of\r\nnecessities has tended to work against this stabilization.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the falling ruble and the avaricious speculator between\r\nthem drive thousands of the stubborn into the category of useful\r\nlaborers. Every day brings numbers who have, either through a change of\r\nheart, or by economic necessity, been driven to ask for work which will\r\nentitle them to their bread and food cards. Thus the Communists, too\r\nbusy with the military defence of their country to attend to the last\r\nmeasures of expropriation, make use of the irresistible economic forces\r\nof the old order and allow the capitalists to expropriate themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LENIN IN SWITZERLAND, MARCH, 1916]\r\n\r\nI found no Red terror. There was serious restriction of personal liberty\r\nand stern enforcement of law and order, as might be expected in a nation\r\nthreatened with foreign invasion, civil war, counter revolution, and an\r\nactual blockade. While I was in Moscow sixty men and seven women were\r\nshot for complicity in a counter revolutionary plot. They had arms\r\nstored in secret places and had been found guilty of circularizing the\r\nsoldiers on the Denikin front, telling them that Petrograd and Moscow\r\nhad both fallen. They made no concealment of their purpose to overthrow\r\nthe Government and went bravely to their execution. Several days later\r\ntwo bombs were exploded under a building in which a meeting of the\r\nExecutive Committee of the Communist party was being held. Eleven of the\r\nCommunists were killed and more than twenty wounded. The cadet counter\r\nrevolutionists, it was charged, committed this outrage as reprisal for\r\nthe execution of their comrades. But no terror or persecution followed.\r\nInstead great mass meetings were held everywhere to protest against all\r\nterrorist acts. Intrigue and propaganda were met with counter propaganda\r\nand popular enthusiasm for the Soviet Government.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving Moscow for Petrograd I applied at the Foreign Office for\r\npermission to go to the Kremlin and interview Lenin. I was told that\r\npermission would be granted, and an appointment was made for me to meet\r\nLenin at his office at three o’clock on the following day.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n                          INTERVIEW WITH LENIN\r\n\r\n\r\nA quarter of an hour ahead of the hour set for my appointment with\r\nLenin, I hastened to the Kremlin enclosure, the well-guarded seat of the\r\nexecutive government. Two Russian soldiers inspected my pass and led me\r\nacross a bridge to obtain another pass from a civilian to enter the\r\nKremlin itself and to return to the outside. I had heard that Lenin was\r\nguarded by Chinese soldiers, but I looked in vain for a Chinese among\r\nthe guards that surrounded the Kremlin. In fact I saw but two Chinese\r\nsoldiers during my entire stay in Soviet Russia.\r\n\r\nI mounted the hill and went toward the building where Lenin lives and\r\nhas his office. At the outer door two more soldiers met me, inspected my\r\npasses, and directed me up a long staircase, at the top of which stood\r\ntwo more soldiers. They directed me down a long corridor to another\r\nsoldier who sat before a door. This one inspected my passes and finally\r\nadmitted me to a large room in which many clerks, both men and women,\r\nwere busy over desks and typewriters. In the next room I found Lenin’s\r\nsecretary who informed me that “Comrade Lenin will be at liberty in a\r\nfew minutes.” It was then five minutes before three. A clerk gave me a\r\ncopy of the _London Times_, dated September 2, 1919, and told me to sit\r\ndown. While I read an editorial the secretary addressed me and asked me\r\nto go into the next room. As I turned to the door it opened, and Lenin\r\nstood waiting with a smile on his face.\r\n\r\nIt was twelve minutes past three, and Lenin’s first words were, “I am\r\nglad to meet you, and I apologize for keeping you waiting.”\r\n\r\nLenin is a man of middle height, close to fifty years of age. He is well\r\nproportioned, and very active, physically, in spite of the fact that he\r\ncarries in his body two bullets fired at him in August, 1918. His head\r\nis large, massive in outline, and is set close to his shoulders. His\r\nforehead is broad and high, his mouth large, the eyes wide apart and\r\nthere appears in them at times a very infectious twinkle. His hair,\r\npointed beard, and mustache, have a brown tinge. His face has\r\nwrinkles,—said by some to be wrinkles of humor,—but I am inclined to\r\nbelieve them the result of deep study, and of the suffering he endured\r\nthrough long years of exile and persecution. I would not minimize the\r\ncontribution that his sense of humor has made to these lines and\r\nwrinkles, for no man who lacked a sense of humor could have overcome the\r\nobstacles he has met.\r\n\r\nDuring our conversation his eyes never left mine. This direct regard was\r\nnot that of a man who wished to be on guard; it bespoke a frank\r\ninterest, which seemed to me to say, “We shall be able to tell many\r\nthings of interest to each other. I believe you to be a friend. In any\r\nevent we shall have an interesting talk.”\r\n\r\nHe moved his chair close to his desk and turned so that his knees were\r\nclose to mine. Almost at once he began asking me about the labor\r\nmovement in America, and from that he went on to discuss the labor\r\nsituation in other countries. He was thoroughly informed even as to the\r\nmost recent developments everywhere. I soon found myself asking him\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nI told him that the press of various countries had been saying that\r\nSoviet Russia was a dictatorship of a small minority. He replied, \"Let\r\nthose who believe that silly tale come here and mingle with the rank and\r\nfile and learn the truth.\r\n\r\n\"The vast majority of industrial workers and at least one-half of the\r\narticulate peasantry are for Soviet rule, and are prepared to defend it\r\nwith their lives.\r\n\r\n“You say you have been along the Western Front,” he continued. “You\r\nadmit that you have been allowed to mingle with the soldiers of Soviet\r\nRussia, that you have been unhampered in making your investigation. You\r\nhave had a very good opportunity to understand the temper of the rank\r\nand file. You have seen thousands of men living from day to day on black\r\nbread and tea. You have probably seen more suffering in Soviet Russia\r\nthan you had ever thought possible, and all this because of the unjust\r\nwar being made upon us, including the economic blockade, in all of which\r\nyour own country is playing a large part. Now I ask you what is your\r\nopinion about this being a dictatorship of the minority?”\r\n\r\nI could only answer that from what I had seen and experienced I could\r\nnot believe that these people, who had found their strength and\r\noverthrown a despotic Czar, would ever submit to such privations and\r\nsufferings except in defence of a government in which, however\r\nimperfect, they had ultimate faith, and which they were prepared to\r\ndefend against all odds.\r\n\r\n“What have you to say at this time about peace and foreign concessions?”\r\nI asked.\r\n\r\nHe answered, “I am often asked whether those American opponents of the\r\nwar against Russia—as in the first place bourgeois—are right who expect\r\nfrom us, after peace is concluded, not only resumption of trade\r\nrelations but also the possibility of securing concessions in Russia. I\r\nrepeat once more that they are right. A durable peace would be such a\r\nrelief to the toiling masses of Russia that these masses would\r\nundoubtedly agree to certain concessions being granted. The granting of\r\nconcessions under reasonable terms is also desirable to us, as one of\r\nthe means of attracting into Russia the technical help of the countries\r\nwhich are more advanced in this respect, during the co-existence side by\r\nside of Socialist and capitalist states.”\r\n\r\nIn reply to my next question about Soviet power he replied:\r\n\r\n\"As for the Soviet power, it has become familiar to the minds and hearts\r\nof the laboring masses of the whole world which clearly grasped its\r\nmeaning. Everywhere the laboring masses, in spite of the influence of\r\nthe old leaders with their chauvinism and opportunism which permeates\r\nthem through and through, became aware of the rottenness of the\r\nbourgeois parliaments and of the necessity of the Soviet power, the\r\npower of the toiling masses, the dictatorship of the proletariat, for\r\nthe sake of the emancipation of humanity from the yoke of capital. And\r\nthe Soviet power will win in the whole world, however furiously, however\r\nfrantically the bourgeoisie of all countries may rage and storm.\r\n\r\n“The bourgeoisie inundates Russia with blood, waging war upon us and\r\ninciting against us the counter revolutionaries, those who wish the yoke\r\nof capital to be restored. The bourgeoisie inflict upon the working\r\nmasses of Russia unprecedented sufferings, through the blockade, and\r\nthrough their help given to the counter revolutionaries, but we have\r\nalready defeated Kolchak and we are carrying on the war against Denikin\r\nwith the firm assurance of our coming victory.”\r\n\r\nIn his replies to my last questions he had covered the ground of the\r\nothers on my list, and since the fifteen minutes allotted to me had\r\nextended to more than an hour, I rose to go. I intended to ask him about\r\n“nationalization of women.” I had never believed the story, and had\r\nalready discovered that it was false, but I had thought to ask Lenin how\r\nthe story arose. When I met him and had talked to him something in his\r\nface silenced the question. Perhaps it was the mocking humor that seemed\r\nready to flash out of the wrinkled countenance in scathing ridicule, or\r\nperhaps it was the sign of long-suffering and profound thought that lay\r\ndeeper. Whatever it was I did not ask that question. I had seen for\r\nmyself that women in Soviet Russia are shown a respect and deference far\r\nexceeding the superficial politeness which in other countries too often\r\nserves to conceal political, economic, and domestic oppression. Women\r\nare on an equal footing in all respects with men in Russia, and they\r\nenjoy a greater measure of freedom and security than the women of other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nHe shook hands cordially, and I went away cudgelling my brains to find\r\nanother figure among the statesmen of the world with whom I might\r\ncompare him. I could think only of our own Lincoln, whose image came to\r\nme, suggested perhaps by the simplicity and plainness of Lenin’s attire.\r\nWorkman’s shoes, worn trousers, a soft shirt with a black four-in-hand\r\ntie, a cheap office coat, and the kindly strong face and figure,—these\r\nwere my impressions of the man.\r\n\r\nHe works from fifteen to eighteen hours a day, receiving reports,\r\nkeeping in touch with the situation all over Russia, attending committee\r\nmeetings, making speeches, always ready to give anyone advice, counsel,\r\nor suggestion. He lives with his wife who is most loyal and devoted, in\r\nthe same building where he has his office, in two modestly furnished\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\nSoviet rule has captured not only the imagination, but also the\r\nintellects of the majority of the rank and file of Russia. Lenin is\r\nlooked upon as the highest representative of that principle; he is\r\ntrusted and he is loved. I was told that so many people come to see him\r\nfrom the outlying districts, men, women, and children, that it is\r\nimpossible for him to see them all. They bring him bread, eggs, butter,\r\nand fruit,—and he turns all into the common fund.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXTERIOR AND INTERIOR OF LENIN’S HOME IN ZURICH]\r\n\r\nSometime in the future, whatever may happen to Soviet Russia, the true\r\nlife of Lenin will be written, and when it is he will stand out as one\r\nof history’s most remarkable men.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n                            “WHO IS LENIN?”\r\n\r\n\r\nMany conflicting stories were told and published about Lenin after the\r\nBolshevist uprising in November, 1917. I decided to ascertain for myself\r\nduring the two weeks I spent in Switzerland before going into Russia\r\nwhat the people of that country knew about him.\r\n\r\nLenin arrived in Switzerland in September, 1914, and left for Russia in\r\nMarch, 1917, with thirty other Russians, on the much-talked-of train\r\nthat went through Germany with the sanction of the Kaiser.\r\n\r\nA whole myth has grown up around Lenin since his return to Russia. He\r\nwas a German agent; he was sent from Switzerland to Russia through\r\nGermany; he went for the express purpose of fomenting revolution in\r\norder to break down the morale of the Russian Army and to make it\r\npossible for German militarism to conquer. Document after document was\r\nprinted to prove that this man was mercenary, that he was cold-blooded,\r\nwithout ideals of any kind, and that he had received millions in money\r\nfrom the Germans, whose plans he conscientiously carried out,—at least\r\nin connection with the disorganization of the Russian Army. While in\r\nSwitzerland for two years during the war, he lived in luxury, always had\r\nplenty of money which was supplied from an unknown source, later\r\ndiscovered to be the banks of Germany.\r\n\r\nI found when I went to Zurich that Lenin had passed the greater part of\r\nhis time when in Switzerland in that town, and had lived in the poor\r\nquarter of the city. The house in which he and his wife lived, No. 14\r\nSpiegelgasse, is on a very narrow street running down to the quay. They\r\nlived in one room on the second floor of this house. Their meagre\r\nfurniture included a table, a washstand, two plain chairs, a small\r\nstove, a bed, a couch, and a petrol lamp. The room had a plaster ceiling\r\nand was unpapered, the bare board walls seeming most bleak. A cheap,\r\ndingy carpet covered the floor. The room was accessible only through a\r\ndark narrow corridor. On the same floor were three other rooms, two of\r\nwhich were occupied by two families, and the third was used as a common\r\nkitchen by every one. In this kitchen Lenin’s wife, who was his constant\r\ncompanion, only secretary and assistant, prepared their frugal meals and\r\ncarried them to their room.\r\n\r\nFor these quarters Lenin paid thirty-eight francs a month, the\r\nequivalent of six dollars and sixty cents in American money.\r\n\r\nI was told by many people who had known him in Zurich that Lenin seemed\r\nto wish to mingle only with working people there. His revolutionary\r\nfriends took great pride in saying, “He never spent any time with mere\r\nintellectual reformers.” They told me that much of his time was passed\r\nin the Swiss Workers’ Assembly, where he talked to every one, but never\r\nmade any speeches. He did speak, however, on many occasions in the\r\nRussian Assembly in Zurich.\r\n\r\nHis income was derived from articles written for Russian party papers.\r\nBefore leaving for Russia he closed his account at a Zurich bank and\r\ndrew out the balance on deposit there, which amounted to twenty-five\r\nfrancs.\r\n\r\nFor a short time while in Switzerland Lenin lived in Berne, in two\r\nrooms. I met the woman at whose Pension he dined while there. She said\r\nshe had served Lenin, his wife, and his wife’s mother midday dinners\r\nwhile they stayed there. The price of those meals was eighty centimes\r\neach,—approximately sixteen cents. She informed me that they prepared\r\ntheir own breakfasts and evening meals.\r\n\r\nThe proprietor of the Wiener café, a coffee house located on the corner\r\nof Schrittfaren and Gurtengasse in Berne, told me that he remembered\r\nLenin well, that he had come into his place on a number of occasions for\r\na cup of coffee. “He spent most of his time here reading the papers and\r\ntalking with the waiters,” he said, and described him as always being\r\npoorly dressed.\r\n\r\nNone of these simple people thought of Lenin as a person of any greater\r\nimportance than themselves. He was one of them, a serious student who\r\nmingled with working people, eager to tell them of their importance in\r\nthe political world.\r\n\r\nWhen the Czar was overthrown and the Kerensky Government came into\r\npower, a committee of all the Socialist parties in Switzerland except\r\nthe “Social Patriots” made an effort to assist in getting Russian exiles\r\nback to their own country. This committee collected the money for the\r\ntransportation of the exiles. They endeavored to secure from France,\r\nEngland, and Switzerland permission for their passage through Archangel\r\nto Petrograd, but the Allied governments denied this permit. Then the\r\nSwiss Socialists entered into negotiations with the German Government to\r\nsecure passage through Germany. On condition that an equal number of\r\ncivilian prisoners then held in Russia be allowed to return to Germany,\r\nthe German Government agreed to the passage of the immigrants through\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nThe following statement, signed by the members of the Committee, is\r\ngiven in full, even to the peculiar English of the translation.\r\n\r\n                _“The Return of the Russian Emigrants.”_\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the Entente newspapers have recently published\r\na series of sensational and false accounts and articles regarding the\r\nreturn of the Russian comrades (Lenin, Zinovieff and others) branding\r\nthem as accomplices and agents of Imperial Germany, as coworkers of the\r\nGerman Government. Simultaneously the German and Austrian press is\r\nattempting to represent these Russian revolution comrades as pacifists\r\nand separate peace advocates, we therefore deem it necessary to publish\r\nthe following explanation under the Signature of the Comrades of France,\r\nGermany, Poland and Switzerland to whitewash the Comrades that departed\r\nto Russia.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned are aware of the hindrances which the governments of\r\nthe Entente are putting in the way of our Russian Internationalists in\r\ntheir departure. They learned of the conditions which the German\r\nGovernment has placed before them for their passage through to Sweden.\r\n\r\nNot having the slightest doubt as to the fact, that the German\r\nGovernment is speculating by it to strengthen the one-sided anti-war\r\ntendencies in Russia, we declare:\r\n\r\nThe Russian Internationalists who during the whole war period have been\r\ncombating in the sharpest possible manner imperialism in general and the\r\nGerman imperialism in particular, and who are now going to Russia in\r\norder to work there for the cause of the Revolution, will thus be aiding\r\nthe proletarians of all countries as well, and particularly the German\r\nand Austrian working class by encouraging them to the revolutionary\r\nstruggle against their own governments.\r\n\r\nNothing can be more stimulating and inspiring in this respect than the\r\nexample of the heroic struggle on the part of the Russian proletariat.\r\nFor that reason we the undersigned Internationalists of France,\r\nSwitzerland, Poland and Germany consider it to be not only the right but\r\na duty on the part of our Russian comrades to use the opportunity for\r\nthe voyage to Russia, which is offered to them.\r\n\r\nWe wish them the best results in the struggle against the Imperialistic\r\npolicy of Russian bourgeoisie, which constitutes a part of our general\r\nstruggle for the liberation of the working class, for the social\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n                                                  Bern, April 7, 1917.\r\n\r\n      Paul Hantstein, Germany\r\n      Henri Guilbeaux, France\r\n      F. Loriot, France\r\n      Bronski, Poland\r\n      F. Platten, Swiss\r\n\r\nThe above declaration has received the full approval and signature of\r\nthe following Scandinavian comrades:\r\n\r\n      Lindhagen, Mayor of Stockholm\r\n      Strom, Congressman and Secretary of S. D. P. of Sweden\r\n      Karleson, Congressman and President of Trades Union Council\r\n      Fure Nerman, Editor _Politiken_\r\n      Tchilbun, Editor _Steukleken_\r\n      Hausen, Norway.\r\n\r\nThe next train left in May, 1917, carrying three hundred Russians, and\r\nanother three hundred went through Germany in July, 1917. In July the\r\nFrench and English governments finally granted permission for a\r\ntrain-load to pass through those countries to Archangel and thence to\r\nRussia. This trip lasted two months. I learned that the May and July\r\ntrains also carried to Russia many active Menshevists, supporters of the\r\nKerensky Government.\r\n\r\nIn August another group tried to return, but because Kerensky protested,\r\nthe French and English notified this group that they must have passports\r\nfrom Russia. It was then impossible to go through Germany because of\r\nbattles going on along the front. They did not get to Russia until\r\nDecember, after the Russian-German armistice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. GORKY              2. ZINOVIEFF]\r\n\r\nZinovieff, in an address to the Petrograd Soviet, September 6, 1918,\r\ntold the story of the fabled armored train as follows:\r\n\r\n“In March, 1917, Lenin returned to Russia. Do you remember the cries\r\nthat went up about the ‘armored train’ on which Lenin and the rest of us\r\nreturned? In reality Lenin felt a profound hatred of German imperialism.\r\nHe hated it no less than he hated any other brand of imperialism....\r\nWhen a prominent member of the Scheidemann party attempted to enter our\r\ncar (which was not armored) in order to ‘greet’ us, he was told, at\r\nLenin’s suggestion, that we would not speak to traitors and that he\r\nwould be sparing himself insult if he refrained from trying to enter.\r\nThe Mensheviki and the Social Revolutionists, who were rather stubborn\r\nat first, later on came back to Russia in the same way (more than three\r\nhundred of them). Lenin put the matter simply, ‘All bourgeois\r\ngovernments are brigands: we have no choice since we cannot get into\r\nRussia by any other way.’”\r\n\r\nI found the following in a long article of appreciation written by\r\nErnest Nobs, editor of the Swiss _Volkrecht_, published in Zurich in\r\nDecember, 1917.\r\n\r\n“One who has seen the last winter, the medium-sized, square-built man,\r\nwith a somewhat yellowish face and sharp, sparkling and flashing Mongol\r\neyes, as he was steering towards some library in a wornout ulster coat,\r\nwith a heap of books under his arm, could hardly foresee in him the\r\nfuture Russian premier.”\r\n\r\nIn the address mentioned on the foregoing page, delivered at the time\r\nLenin was shot, Zinovieff said:\r\n\r\nVladimir Ilyich Ulyanoff (Lenin) was born on April 10, 1870, in the city\r\nof Simbirsk. His father, who was of peasant descent, was employed as\r\nDirector of Public Schools in the Volga region. His elder brother,\r\nAlexander Ulyanoff was executed by Czar Alexander III. From that time on\r\nhis mother showered all her tender affections on Vladimir Ilyich, and\r\nLenin in his turn dearly loved her. Living as an emigrant, an exile,\r\npersecuted by the Czar’s Government, Lenin used to tear himself away\r\nfrom the most urgent tasks to go to Switzerland to see his mother in her\r\nlast days. She died in 1913.\r\n\r\nUpon his graduation from high school (gymnasium) Vladimir Ilyich entered\r\nthe law school at the Kazan University. The universities of the capitals\r\nwere closed to him because he was the brother of an executed\r\nrevolutionist. A month after his entry he was expelled from the\r\nUniversity for participation in a revolutionary movement of the\r\nstudents. It was not until four years had gone by that he was allowed to\r\nresume his studies. The legal career held no attractions for Lenin. His\r\nnatural inclinations lay towards the field of revolutionary activity....\r\nWhen he was expelled from the Kazan University he went to Petrograd. The\r\nfirst phase of his activities was confined to student circles. A year or\r\ntwo later he created in Petrograd the first ‘workmen’s circles’ and a\r\nlittle later crossed swords on the literary arena with the old leader of\r\nthe Populists, N. K. Mikhailovsky. Under the _nom de plume_ of Ilyin,\r\nLenin published a series of brilliant articles on economics which at\r\nonce won him a name.\r\n\r\nIn Petrograd he, with other workers, founded the ‘Union for the\r\nEmancipation of the Working Class,’ and conducted the first labor\r\nstrikes, writing meanwhile leaflets and pamphlets remarkable for their\r\nsimplicity of style and clarity. These were printed on a hectograph and\r\ndistributed.... Very often now workers coming from far off Siberia or\r\nthe Ural to the All-Russian Congress of Soviets recall to him their\r\nactivities together in the early 90’s. They recognize that he was their\r\nteacher, the first to kindle the spark of communism in them.\r\n\r\nIn the 90’s Lenin was sentenced to a long prison term and then exiled.\r\nWhile in exile he devoted himself to scientific and literary activities,\r\nand wrote a number of books. One of these reached a circle of exiles in\r\nSwitzerland, among whom were Plekhanoff, Axelrod, and Zasulich, who\r\nwelcomed Lenin as the harbinger of a coming season, and who could not\r\nfind words of praise sufficiently strong. Another book, a truly\r\nscientific one, won the praise of Professor Maxim Kovalevsky of the\r\nParis School of Social Science. “What a good professor Lenin would have\r\nmade!” he said.\r\n\r\nVladimir Ilyich languished in exile like a caged lion. The only thing\r\nthat saved him was the fact that he was leading the life of a scientist.\r\nHe used to spend fifteen hours daily in the library over books, and it\r\nis not without reason that he is now one of the most cultured men of our\r\ntime.... In 1901 Lenin, together with a group of intimate friends, began\r\nthe publication of a newspaper, _Iskra, The Spark_. This paper not only\r\nwaged a political struggle, but it carried on vast organizing\r\nactivities, and Lenin was the soul of the organizing committee.\r\n\r\nLenin’s wife, Nadezhda Konstantinovna Krupskaya Ulyanova was the\r\nsecretary of _Iskra_ and the secretary of the organizing committee.\r\nThroughout Lenin’s activities as an organizer a considerable share of\r\nthe credit is due to his wife. All the correspondence was in her charge.\r\nAt one time she was in communication with entire Russia. Who did not\r\nknow her? Martov in his bitter controversy with Lenin once called her\r\n\"Secretary of Lenin, the Super-Center.\"...\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1905 the first conference of the Bolsheviki was called.\r\nOfficially it was known as the Third Conference of the Revolutionary\r\nSocial Democratic Labor Party. This conference laid the corner-stone for\r\nthe present Communist Party.... In the revolution of 1905 Lenin’s part\r\nwas enormous, although he was residing in Petrograd illegally and was\r\nforbidden by the party to attend its meetings openly.\r\n\r\nVladimir Ilyich was exiled for the second time in 1907. In Geneva, and\r\nlater in Paris, chiefly through the efforts of Lenin, the newspapers,\r\n_The Proletarian_ and _The Social Democrat_ were founded. Complete\r\ndecadence was reigning all around. Obscene literature took the place of\r\nart literature. The spirit of nihilism permeated the sphere of politics.\r\nStolypin was indulging in his orgies. And it seemed as if there was no\r\nend to all this.\r\n\r\nAt such times true leaders reveal themselves. Vladimir Ilyich suffered\r\nat that time, as he did right along in exile, the greatest personal\r\nprivations. He lived like a pauper, he was sick and starved, especially\r\nwhen he lived in Paris. But he retained his courage as no one else did.\r\nHe stood firmly and bravely at his post. He alone knew how to weld\r\ntogether a circle of gallant fighters to whom he used to say, “Do not\r\nlose your courage. The dark days will pass, a few years will elapse, and\r\nthe proletarian revolution will be revived.”\r\n\r\nFor two years Lenin scarcely left the national library at Paris, and\r\nduring this time he accomplished such a large amount of work that even\r\nthose very professors who were attempting to ridicule his philosophic\r\nworks admitted that they could not understand how a man could do so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\nThe years 1910–11 brought a fresh breeze to stir the atmosphere. It\r\nbecame clear in 1911 that the workers’ movement was beginning to revive.\r\nWe had in Petrograd a paper, the _Star_, (_Zviezda_), and in Moscow a\r\nmagazine, _Thought_ (_Mysl_), and there was a small labor representation\r\nin the Duma. And the principal worker both on these papers and for the\r\nDuma representation was Lenin. He taught the principles of revolutionary\r\nparliamentarism to the labor deputies in the Duma. “You just get up and\r\ntell the whole of Russia plainly about the life of the worker. Depict\r\nthe horrors of the capitalist galleys, call upon the workers to revolt,\r\nfling into the face of the black Duma the name of ‘scoundrels and\r\nexploiters.’” At first they found this strange advice. The entire Duma\r\natmosphere was depressing, its members and ministers met in the Tauride\r\npalace, clad in full dress suits. They learned their lessons however.\r\n\r\nIn 1912 we started to lead a new life. At the January conference of that\r\nyear the Bolsheviki reunited their ranks which had been broken up by the\r\ncounter revolution. At the request of the new Central Executive\r\nCommittee Lenin and myself went to Krakov (Cracow, in Galicia). There\r\ncomrades began to come to us from Petrograd, Moscow, and elsewhere. I\r\nrecall the first large general meeting of the Petrograd metal workers,\r\nin 1913. Two hours after our candidates had been elected to the\r\nexecutive committee Lenin received a wire from the metal workers,\r\ncongratulating him upon the victory. He lived a thousand versts away\r\nfrom Petrograd, yet he was the very soul of the workers of Petrograd. It\r\nwas a repetition of what took place in 1906–7 when Lenin lived in\r\nFinland, and we used to visit him every week to receive counsel from\r\nhim. From the little village of Kuokalla, in Finland, he steered the\r\nlabor movement of Petrograd.\r\n\r\nIn 1915–17 Lenin was leading a very peculiar life in Switzerland. The\r\nwar and the collapse of the International had a very marked effect on\r\nhim. Many of his comrades who knew him well were surprised at the\r\nchanges wrought in him by the war.\r\n\r\nHe never felt very tenderly toward the bourgeoisie, but with the\r\nbeginning of the war he began to nurture a concentrated, keen, intense\r\nhatred for them. It seemed that his very countenance had changed.\r\n\r\nIn Zurich he resided in the poorest quarter, in the flat of a shoemaker.\r\nHe appeared to be after every single proletarian, trying as it were to\r\nget hold of him and explain that the war was an imperialistic\r\nslaughter.... Lenin has always understood what enormous difficulties\r\nwould arise before the working class after it had seized all power. From\r\nthe first days of his arrival in Petrograd he carefully observed the\r\neconomic disruption. He valued his acquaintance with every bank\r\nemployee, striving to penetrate into all the details of the banking\r\nbusiness. He was well aware of the provisioning problem, and of other\r\ndifficulties. In one of his most remarkable books he dwells at length on\r\nthese difficulties. On the question of the nationalization of banks, in\r\nthe domain of the provisioning policy and on the war question Lenin has\r\nsaid the decisive word. He worked out concretely the plan of practical\r\nmeasures to be adopted in all domains of national life, long before\r\nOctober 25, (November 7), 1917. The plan is clear, concrete, distinct,\r\nlike all his works....\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ZINOVIEFF\r\n  President of the Petrograd Soviet\r\n]\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n                               PETROGRAD\r\n\r\n\r\nI arrived at the Nicolai station in Petrograd on the 24th of September,\r\nfrom Moscow, and went at once to the Astoria hotel on St. Isaac’s Square\r\nat the farther end of Nevsky Prospekt. As we drove along the\r\nthoroughfare I noticed workmen tearing out the wooden paving-blocks\r\nwhich covered that famous street, and recalled having read in New York\r\npapers that whole streets in Petrograd had been torn up and used for\r\nfuel. This seemed credible enough, even desirable, I thought, as I\r\nrecalled the shivering nights I had spent in Russia. When my droshky\r\ncame nearer to the crew of workers I saw worn and broken blocks piled to\r\none side; in their places new blocks had been put in. Two days later I\r\nwalked along this same thoroughfare from one end to the other, still\r\nlooking for unmended gaps in the paving. My search was vain. And the\r\npavements of the side streets, on which I walked miles during my stay in\r\nPetrograd, were in good condition.\r\n\r\nMany of the shops along Nevsky Prospekt were closed and boarded up, and\r\nthose that remained open had but few wares on their shelves. The large\r\nstores, however, now converted into Soviet stores, were all open and\r\ncontained a goodly supply of various commodities, but the bright-colored\r\ntoys that used to fill the shop windows of Petrograd had entirely\r\ndisappeared. Apparently the peasants of Russia, busy with weightier\r\nmatters, had found no time to carve grotesque wooden figures and\r\ncharming dolls and the other gayly-colored toys they know so well how to\r\nmake. The Russian child who does not have these toys left over from the\r\nold days has to do without.\r\n\r\nWhatever beautiful things Russia still had, however, were placed in the\r\nstores along with the necessities. They were not regarded as luxuries\r\nfor the few. Art belongs to every one in Soviet Russia.\r\n\r\nI learned that the high wall which used to surround the Winter Palace of\r\nthe Czar had been torn down, and when I asked why this had been done,\r\nwas told that there was a beautiful garden back of this wall, and since\r\n“beauty should not be hidden from the people,” they had torn down the\r\nwall so that all might see the garden. The palace itself was unoccupied.\r\nIts art treasures had been removed to Moscow, and placed in museums\r\nthere. It was planned to make a museum of the palace later.\r\n\r\nOn my second day in Petrograd I went out to Smolny Institute, a large\r\nstone structure overlooking the Neva, formerly a school for the\r\ndaughters of the aristocracy, now the office building of the officials\r\nand workers of the Northern Commune and Petrograd Soviet.\r\n\r\nIn front of the institute there was set up a large statue of Karl Marx.\r\nIt looked impressive enough from a distance. But when I passed on my way\r\ninto the building and looked back at the statue I discovered Karl Marx—a\r\nsilk hat in his hand. I have not yet been able to get over my memory of\r\nthe great economist standing there, heroically erect, before the\r\nheadquarters of the workingmen’s government, holding a silk hat.\r\n\r\nIn Smolny Institute I met Zinovieff, president of the Petrograd Soviet,\r\na curly-haired, impetuous Jew, full of energy and with a deep\r\nunderstanding of the Russian revolutionary movement. He has been a\r\nlife-long friend of Lenin and was his companion in exile. I found him\r\ndistrustful at first, but very cordial when convinced that my intentions\r\nwere honest.\r\n\r\n“Do you still talk about nationalization of women in America?” he asked\r\nme with a broad grin. He was the only official in Soviet Russia who ever\r\nmentioned the subject to me.\r\n\r\nLater in the day I attended a meeting of the Petrograd Soviets which\r\nincluded representatives of all unions, army, navy and peasants. They\r\nwere assembled in the Tauride Palace, where the Duma met formerly. A\r\ndecree for compulsory education for adults was under consideration, and\r\nZinovieff spoke for the adoption of the decree. I could not, of course,\r\nunderstand his impassioned address, which subsequent translation\r\nrevealed to be a clear analysis of the whole educational problem. He has\r\na high-pitched voice, which grated on my ears sometimes, but rang with\r\nearnestness and conviction. The decree, which is now in effect, was\r\npassed by a practically unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nIt provided that after November 1, 1919, all adults of the Northern\r\nCommune unable to read and write would have to attend public school\r\nclasses two hours daily for six months, at the end of which time those\r\nunable to pass the examinations were to be denied the right to work. For\r\ntheir hours of study the decree provided that they be paid wages at the\r\nrate in effect in their branches of industry.\r\n\r\nFor those illiterates in occupations requiring eight hours labor, the\r\nworking day was reduced to six, giving them the opportunity to spend the\r\nfull two hours in school. The six-hour day in force in the hazardous\r\noccupations was reduced to four hours.\r\n\r\nSoviet officials informed me that passage of the decree did not mean\r\nthat those who were unable to assimilate knowledge would be denied the\r\nright to work. That disciplining would be invoked only for those capable\r\nones who wilfully refused to study. The measure was but one of the\r\nefforts of the Soviet Government to hasten the development of the\r\nintellectual side of the people’s life and to raise culture in general.\r\nUnder Czars there were few public schools, and these were inefficiently\r\nconducted. Seventy-five percent of the people could not read or write.\r\n\r\nI inquired about the “Red Terror” in Petrograd. “Yes,” I was informed,\r\n“there were two or three days of Red Terror in August, 1918, when Lenin\r\nwas shot, in Moscow.” The rank and file were devoted to this man, and\r\nwhen they heard of the attempt on his life they turned loose, and it\r\ntook three days of hard work on the part of the government officials and\r\nthe government party members to stop the rush of the mob. Probably two\r\nthousand were killed, and during the six weeks that Lenin lay between\r\nlife and death great crowds of working people watched the bulletins from\r\nhis physicians that were posted on walls in all parts of the city from\r\nday to day. I was told that quite aside from his value to the government\r\nitself, it was a godsend to Russia that he survived, because his death\r\nwould have meant an uprising that would have spared no human being\r\nbelieved to be in opposition to Lenin and the Soviet Government. Even\r\nZinovieff is reported to have lost his head for a little time, when he\r\nheard of the precarious condition of his old friend and comrade.\r\n\r\nA Russian friend of mine in America had asked me to look for his father\r\nwho lived two or three blocks from St. Isaac’s Square when last heard\r\nfrom four years before.\r\n\r\nI found the old man in his place of business—a picture frame store. He\r\nlived with his wife in two or three rooms in the rear. He had been in\r\nbusiness for years, and was one of the bourgeoisie of the olden days.\r\nWhen I asked him if he had been disturbed by the Bolsheviki he said that\r\nduring the two years since the revolution his store had been visited\r\nonce by the authorities—an officer came to inquire for the address of\r\nsome person living in the immediate neighborhood.\r\n\r\nI asked him how he liked the new regime. “I don’t like it because food\r\nis scarce and prices high.” He showed me a small picture frame. “Before\r\nthe war I could sell this for 70 kopecks, now I must charge 40\r\nrubles,—but then maybe it was the war and not the revolution that caused\r\nthe high prices,—I don’t know.”\r\n\r\nHe took me down the street three blocks to visit his daughter, so that\r\nwhen I returned to America I could assure my friend that his sister,\r\ntoo, was safe. She and her husband were both working for the Soviet\r\nGovernment and had but one complaint to make, “scarcity of food.” She\r\nwas a teacher in one of the Soviet schools. They had two beautiful boys;\r\nthe elder was studying sculpture in a Soviet art school, the younger was\r\nstill in the grades. I asked this most intelligent and refined woman\r\nwhether the Bolshevists had broken up the homes in Petrograd. She smiled\r\nand said, “Do they believe that in America?” When I had to answer that\r\n“some do,” she replied, “Please tell them it does not show intelligence\r\nto believe such things.”\r\n\r\nI talked to three or four of the business men along the Nevsky Prospekt\r\nwho were still clinging to their little shops, with their pitiful stocks\r\nof goods. These people have remained undisturbed for reasons I have\r\nalready explained. In substance they all said the same thing: “It is\r\nterrible,—terrible. Before long we must quit business. The Bolshevists\r\nare setting up what they call ‘Soviet’ stores. The people don’t come to\r\nus now,—only a few of our old customers. The Soviet stores control the\r\nproducts and undersell us. Russia is doomed. We want to go away. How is\r\nit in America?”\r\n\r\nThe last cry of the private shopkeeper in Russia! Some day when the war\r\nis over and Russia is doing business with the rest of the world, these\r\nsame shopkeepers will probably find the Soviet stores more attractive\r\neven than their own. They may remember, with no regret, their constant\r\nstruggle to survive competition. Doubtless they will get behind the\r\ncounters of the Soviet stores, as many of their kind have already done,\r\nand there find security of employment and compensation, and in the\r\nknowledge that they are rendering a real service to the New Russia they\r\nwill find an adequate substitute for the stimulation of “private\r\nenterprise.”\r\n\r\nWith the removal of the capital to Moscow, the sending of thousands of\r\nworkers to the army, the voluntary emigration to the villages of\r\nthousands of others, and the exodus of the bourgeoisie to Scandinavia,\r\nFrance, England and even America, Petrograd has probably one half the\r\npopulation it had under the Czar. Moscow had gained, however, during the\r\nsame period in greater proportion than Petrograd lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHICHERIN\r\n  Commissar of Foreign Affairs\r\n]\r\n\r\nTram cars were running more regularly than in Moscow, so far as I could\r\nobserve. The streets were poorly lighted, as in Moscow, and for the same\r\nreason. All automobiles had been requisitioned by the army and were used\r\nmostly for trucking. The city was policed by women in daytime, by men at\r\nnight. It was rather startling to encounter a woman policeman with a\r\nrifle on her shoulder, but the people took it for granted, and I was\r\ntold that the women were quite as efficient as the men. In spite of poor\r\nlighting, Petrograd is as safe as Moscow at night—or as safe as New York\r\nor Chicago, for that matter. Prostitution has lost its clientele.\r\nThousands of women from the streets have found decent employment in\r\nvarious institutions of the Soviet Government, and are able to lead\r\nindependent, normal lives.\r\n\r\nI visited one of the large textile industries, which was in full\r\noperation, employing probably three thousand men and women. They were\r\nmaking civilian suits and overcoats and winter coats for the soldiers.\r\nMotor lorries drove up and carried away thousands of these winter coats\r\nfor shipment to the soldiers at the front.\r\n\r\nSome of the factories were closing down through lack of fuel. I asked\r\nwhat would become of the workers who were thrown out of employment, and\r\nwas told that pending their re-employment they would be given “out of\r\nwork” cards showing that their idleness was not voluntary, and the\r\ngovernment would continue to pay them their regular wages.\r\n\r\nI visited Maxim Gorky in his modest apartment near the Fortress of Peter\r\nand Paul. Gorky is typical of a large class of the intellectuals. Two\r\nyears ago he was a bitter opponent of Bolshevism, and his writings\r\nviolently attacked the government.\r\n\r\nOf artistic rather than political temperament, and strongly pacifist, he\r\nwas sickened by the killing on both sides. Since then, however, he has\r\ncome to the support of the Soviet Government. His tribute to the\r\nconstructive ability of the Soviet leaders was issued over his signature\r\na year ago, and has been widely circulated.\r\n\r\nI had been told that Maxim Gorky was suffering from tuberculosis, and\r\nafter all the misery I had seen in Soviet Russia because of the lack of\r\nfood, I expected to find him emaciated. Instead, he was vigorous and\r\nhealthy. He stood before me tall, powerful, with a slight bend in his\r\nshoulders. He seemed with his mass of gray hair like some huge and\r\nfearless animal.\r\n\r\nThere was sadness in his voice and his gray eyes when he spoke of\r\nRussia’s suffering. Gorky himself was a child of the streets, and he\r\nfeels keenly the suffering of the people.\r\n\r\nBut it was when he spoke of the future of his country that he was the\r\ntrue Russian. He told me he believed in the invincible spirit of the\r\nRussian masses and their determination to defend “their revolution.” He\r\ndwelt with pride upon the accomplishments of individual workers, whose\r\nnative genius had been set free from the old bondage. I was surprised to\r\nfind the interest he took in the industries. In one factory just outside\r\nof Petrograd, he told me, they were extracting sugar from the sawdust of\r\ncertain woods by a process discovered by a workman. With equal\r\nenthusiasm he told me of another worker who had perfected a method of\r\npreserving fish nets so that their durability had been increased four\r\nhundred percent.\r\n\r\nHe told me a manifesto would soon be issued to the world, coming from a\r\nnumber of Russian scientists of established reputation, setting forth\r\nthe scientific achievements accomplished under Soviet rule.\r\n\r\n“Under two years of Soviet rule,” Gorky said, “there have been more\r\ndiscoveries made in Russia and there has been more progress in general\r\nthan previously in twenty years under Czarism.”\r\n\r\nThe greatest joy that Gorky finds in his work for the Soviet Government\r\nis in the tremendous task of preserving the art of old Russia and\r\ncreating new art. Even in the throes of the revolution when Gorky\r\nopposed the Bolshevik rule, he was working with the government to\r\npreserve the old art.\r\n\r\nUnder his direction a museum was established in a fine structure,\r\nwherein were stored thousands of art treasures recovered during the\r\nrevolution. Bourgeoisie who fled to other countries left their\r\nunoccupied homes full of beautiful things. The Soviet Government took\r\npossession of these homes at once and removed valuable art to the\r\nmuseum. Manifestos were sent broadcast appealing to the people to\r\npreserve these things which were now theirs. In Petrograd the following\r\nbulletin, under the title “Appeal for the Preservation of Works of Art,”\r\nappeared:\r\n\r\n“Citizens! The old landlords have gone. Behind them remains a tremendous\r\ninheritance. Now it belongs to the whole people. Guard this inheritance;\r\ntake care of the palaces. They will stand as the palaces of the art of\r\nthe whole people. Preserve the pictures, the statues, the\r\nbuildings—these are a concentration of the spiritual force of yourselves\r\nand of your forefathers. Art is that beauty which men of talent have\r\nbeen able to create even under the lash of despotism. Do not touch a\r\nsingle stone, safeguard monuments, buildings, ancient things, and\r\ndocuments. All these are your history, your pride.”\r\n\r\n“But it was impossible to save everything,” Gorky told me. “There were\r\nthe soldiers and the peasants, who had never had a chance to see any of\r\nthese beautiful things in the past. The people did not wish to destroy\r\nthese things. They only threw away what seemed worthless to them. One\r\npriceless painting was found in a garbage can. But it was found and\r\nbrought back by the people themselves. And now it is in the museum where\r\nevery one may see it.”\r\n\r\nGorky is head of the “World Literature Publishing House,” a vast\r\ninstitution organized by the Soviet Government to publish the best\r\nliterary and scientific productions of all countries in popular editions\r\nfor the Russian masses. A great staff of literary and professional men\r\nand women are enrolled in this work. Already about six hundred books\r\nhave been edited and are ready for publication, although only thirty\r\nvolumes had been printed when the work had to stop on account of the\r\nlack of paper. As soon as paper is available they hope to begin printing\r\nmillions of volumes in editions which will be within the reach of all\r\nthe Russian people.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this work Gorky has been devoting much time to the\r\npreparation of a series of motion-picture scenarios, composed with\r\nscientific historical exactness, showing the history of man from the\r\nStone Age down through the Middle Ages to the time of Louis XVI of\r\nFrance, and finally to the present day. This work was begun in July\r\n1919, and when I talked with Gorky in September of the same year, he\r\ntold me that they had already finished twenty-five scenarios. He\r\ndescribed the extraordinary difficulties under which the work was going\r\nforward; the actors and actresses who were often undernourished,\r\npersevered over all obstacles, inspired by an enthusiasm which Gorky\r\nthought would have been impossible in any other country. The Soviet\r\nGovernment was aiding the production in every way. The best actors and\r\nactresses in the country had been enlisted in this work along with\r\nhistorians and scientists. The films were being sent into the remote\r\ntowns and villages, and thousands of small theatres already were being\r\nbuilt.\r\n\r\nThe motion picture theatres in general in Petrograd were not showing the\r\nordinary romances that we see in this country in films. The motion\r\npicture was used largely for educating the people and showing the\r\ndevelopment of industry, the proper care of children and the advantages\r\nof sanitary conditions. Russia is in great need of education so far as\r\nsanitation is concerned. In the large cities the sanitation is modern,\r\nbut in smaller towns and in the villages the people have no idea of a\r\nsewage system.\r\n\r\nThe theatre of Soviet Russia had already been organized throughout the\r\ncountry at the time of my visit. The production of plays and scenarios\r\nwas included in the educational program of the government. The theatres\r\nwere organized into one corporation and subsidized by the Soviet\r\nGovernment, which did not, however, interfere in any way with the\r\nartistic work of the producers. I saw Schiller’s “Robbers” and Gorky’s\r\n“Lower Depths” produced wonderfully. The people crowded to the theatres.\r\nThe first four performances each week are set aside for the Soviet\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nGorky assured me that the elements opposed to Soviet rule “do not find\r\nany support among the rank and file. The working class strongly supports\r\nthe Soviets, and most of the peasants approve, although the village\r\nyouth is still indifferent.”\r\n\r\nThe Jewish people were playing an important part in the revolutionary\r\nreconstruction of the country, Gorky said, but added that he did not\r\nmean the class of Jews who had been influential in the old régime. The\r\nJews who had come forward under the revolution were the ones who had\r\nformerly been kept within the pale. They felt that a new freedom had\r\nbeen offered them by the Soviet Government, that they would be treated\r\nas brothers, and so they were rendering valuable constructive service.\r\n\r\n“If they would only leave us alone,” he cried out bitterly. “Tell\r\nAmerica for the sake of humanity to leave Russia alone.” His words\r\nfairly burned as he sat there and talked, emphasizing each phrase with a\r\ngesture of his clenched fists. “Tell them to leave us alone. I know\r\nquite well that there are many persons in America who have no vision of\r\nthis Russia, who have no comprehension of what Russia is. But after all,\r\nyou have a few enlightened people in America. Please tell them that\r\nRussia is not Central Africa, without civilization or statesmanship.\r\nRussia is well able to take care of herself.”\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n                    BOLSHEVIK LEADERS—BRIEF SKETCHES\r\n\r\n                                TROTZKY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost inseparable from the name of Lenin, in the minds of Americans, is\r\nthat of Trotzky, Minister of War, whose history is well known here. He\r\nwas Minister of Foreign Affairs up to the time of the signing of the\r\nBrest-Litovsk Treaty, when it became necessary to mobilize an army to\r\nprotect Soviet Russia from foreign invasion, and he was made Minister of\r\nWar. He took hold of a badly disorganized and worse discouraged army,\r\nand through his own hard work, and with the assistance of others, built\r\nup an army probably better than any other in the world today.\r\n\r\nWhile in Moscow I heard him address a gathering of some two thousand\r\nwomen, in the Labor Temple—formerly a noblemen’s club. He had just\r\nreturned from the front, and was still wearing his suit of plain khaki\r\nand high boots. He reviewed the work of the Red Army, recounting its\r\nvictories and defeats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LITVINOFF\r\n  Assistant Commissar of Foreign Affairs\r\n]\r\n\r\nA well-set figure, with black eyes flashing through a pair of thick\r\nglasses; a wealth of jet black hair brushed back from a high forehead;\r\ndark moustache and small beard; his whole face tanned from being in the\r\nopen with the troops, he paced the platform from one end to the other,\r\nlike a caged lion. When he spoke of the counter-revolutionary forces his\r\nvoice resounded through the hall, filled with scorn, and his face wore a\r\nlook that was uncanny. The next moment his expression changed, and\r\nlowering his voice he spoke in soothing tones of the heroism and\r\ndevotion of the soldiers of the Red Army.\r\n\r\nI could understand at the end of his forty minutes’ address what Colonel\r\nRaymond Robins meant when he said: “Trotzky is a great orator.” He is\r\nundoubtedly the most convincing I have ever heard, and I have heard many\r\nin several countries. He seems to tug at his listeners until they find\r\nthemselves leaning forward so as not to miss a single word. The history\r\nof this man’s life and activities would make an interesting book. I hope\r\nit will be written.\r\n\r\n                               CHICHERIN\r\n\r\nAs Minister of Foreign Affairs, Trotzky was succeeded by Chicherin. He\r\nis a tall, slightly stooped figure, about fifty years old, with eyes\r\nthat burn like coals. He is emaciated from hunger and from hard work.\r\nNever a day goes by but Chicherin can be found in his office from twelve\r\nto sixteen hours of the time, working with quiet determination and zeal.\r\nI saw him in his office at the Metropole two or three times, and was\r\ncaptivated by his kind and gentle manner.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said to me, \"we want peace and are ready to conclude at once.\r\nConcessions are still here for American capital. Leases can be had for\r\nforty-nine years. All we ask is that the Russian labor laws shall\r\nprevail here and the Government shall not be interfered with. There is\r\nflax here, and timber and many other things that the people of your\r\ncountry want.\r\n\r\n“Go back to America and tell them to leave us alone. Just let us get our\r\nbreath and turn our energies into productive work.”\r\n\r\nThey all said that, Chicherin and many other Commissars. All dwelt upon\r\nthe need for technical assistance. They look forward to the day when\r\nthey will be able to apply the best technical and scientific experience\r\nof the world to the solution of their problems. They need experts in all\r\nlines and of all grades, from simple mechanicians to the most highly\r\ntrained laboratory specialists.\r\n\r\n                               LITVINOFF\r\n\r\nLitvinoff is a solidly built, jovial, and very astute Lithuanian. He was\r\none of the Collegium in the foreign office under Chicherin, and was the\r\nSoviet ambassador in England after the revolution. Later he was sent\r\nback to Russia by the British Government. He is an equally shrewd\r\nbusiness man and diplomat, and looks more like a British member of\r\nparliament than a Russian Bolshevik. He has a keen sense of humor and\r\nfun, but takes his duties very seriously. He is the type of man often\r\nseen among directors of great enterprises in America, putting through\r\n“big deals.” One imagines that if he chose to sell his services to a\r\ncapitalist organization or state he could easily become a “big man.”\r\n\r\nHe was my first host in Moscow, and was very kind and helpful in giving\r\nme all the information and assistance possible.\r\n\r\n                            MADAME KOLLONTAY\r\n\r\nI met Madame Kollontay in the National Hotel, three or four days after I\r\narrived in Moscow. She is a beautiful, cultured woman, and an excellent\r\nspeaker. She had just returned from a tour of the southern part of\r\nRussia, where she had been establishing schools and organizing homes for\r\nthe aged, and informed me that the children are so enthusiastic that\r\nthey do not want to go home when the day’s session is over. “There is a\r\nfeeling of solidarity among them,” she said. “They are being educated\r\nwithout the feeling of property of any kind. The psychology of the\r\npeople has so changed since the revolution that the old order could not\r\nlast even if it were to be restored,” she said “and if the Allies would\r\nonly withdraw their armies and stop supporting the counter-revolutionary\r\nforces Russia could recoup herself without outside aid of any kind.”\r\n\r\nAsked about the devotion of the people to Lenin she replied that while\r\nhe was deeply loved and respected the people were not following him\r\nblindly, and that their devotion was due to the fact that they realized\r\nthat he stood always for their best interests.\r\n\r\nMadame Kollontay has spent several years in America and asked me about\r\nmany of her friends in this country. She said she hoped to be able to\r\nreturn at some future time.\r\n\r\n                           MADAME BALABANOVA\r\n\r\nMadame Balabanova, secretary of the Third International, which has\r\nheadquarters at Moscow, is an Italian, not over five feet tall, elderly,\r\nbut full of fire and spirit. She speaks many languages, including fluent\r\nEnglish. I met her on several occasions in Moscow. She reminded me that\r\nthere was much work to be done, and that the revolution had not ended\r\nwith the overthrowing of the old order. “We are building the new\r\nsociety,” she said, “but it is slow work because of the necessity of\r\nconverting the country into an armed camp to repel invasion, but when\r\nthe war stops we will show the world what Soviet rule can do for the\r\noppressed.”\r\n\r\nShe said she hoped to go back to Italy sometime, but presumed it would\r\nbe impossible, at least until that and other countries had recognized\r\nthat the Russians and those in sympathy with them were human beings and\r\nnot “carriers of contagion.”\r\n\r\nShe is a wonderful speaker and an extremely energetic and hard working\r\nlittle woman, much admired and respected by her colleagues.\r\n\r\nI once accompanied her on a visit to a hospital, where she spoke to\r\nwounded soldiers. More than two hundred convalescent soldiers made up\r\nher audience. They lay on their cots or sat in wheel-chairs, some of\r\nthem armless or with but one arm, others with one leg shot off, and many\r\nwith ugly head wounds. They greeted Madame Balabanova cheerily, and\r\nlistened almost eagerly to her story of what was going on at the front\r\nand in the country generally. When she had finished her address there\r\nwas a silence, and then from all the men came the deep singing of the\r\n_Internationale_.\r\n\r\n                                BUCHARIN\r\n\r\nBucharin, a close friend and companion of Lenin, is the editor of\r\n_Pravda_, the party organ in Moscow. I learned that he, too, had been in\r\nAmerica for two or three months previous to the overthrow of the Czar,\r\nand had hurried back when this news reached him. He is a small figure,\r\nalways hurrying somewhere, with a book under his arm. One meets him in\r\nthe Theater Square in the morning, in Soviet Square a few hours later,\r\nat the Kremlin still later, and in the evening at the extreme opposite\r\nend of the city. There is a saying about him, “One can never tell where\r\nhe will turn up next. He is always on the move.” And yet he always has\r\ntime for a kindly word or question or greeting. He is a student of\r\nhistory and quotes freely, from memory, all the Russian and many\r\nEuropean writers.\r\n\r\n                            GEORGE MELCHOIR\r\n\r\nGeorge Melchoir is president of the Moscow Central Federation of\r\nAll-Russian Professional Alliances. He worked for a long time at\r\nBayonne, New Jersey, but like many others returned to Russia after the\r\noverthrow of the Czar. He took an active part in organizing the taking\r\nof Moscow in the early days of the Bolshevist uprising.\r\n\r\nMelchoir has been a working man all his life, and is extremely\r\nintelligent. The position which he holds demands a great deal of\r\ntechnical knowledge, as well as executive ability, and every one agreed\r\nthat he was thoroughly qualified for his post. I had a long talk with\r\nhim. He was enthusiastic about the future of Russia. It would be built\r\nup, he said, by the various unions and peasant organizations.\r\n\r\nHe is probably thirty-five years of age, of medium height, with a bulky\r\nfigure, full of vigor and enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n                                 PETERS\r\n\r\nIn the early days of the revolution Peters was chief of the Internal\r\nDefense of Petrograd. American newspapers said of him that “his fingers\r\nwere cramped from writing death warrants.” I asked him how many death\r\nwarrants he had signed and he told me three hundred in all. He expressed\r\nregret that he had been looked upon in other countries as a murderer,\r\nand said it was unfortunate that those people did not understand the\r\nconditions that surrounded Russia while in the throes of a revolution.\r\nHe insisted that the warrants he had signed had been necessary in the\r\ninterest of the country as a whole, and that they had been signed only\r\nafter investigation and a trial of the individuals, and that in no case\r\nhad there been an execution to gratify the personal revenge of any one.\r\n\r\nHe is a Lett, very young, perhaps between twenty-eight and thirty years\r\nold, short and stocky, with a mass of black hair combed straight back.\r\nHe lived in England for a number of years, and speaks the English\r\nlanguage easily and fluently.\r\n\r\n                            BORIS REINSTEIN\r\n\r\nAs a former resident of Buffalo, New York, and member of the American\r\nSocialist Labor Party, Boris Reinstein returned to Russia after the\r\noverthrow of the Czar. He was for some time an assistant in the Foreign\r\nOffice; later a lecturer in a military school, and is now an official\r\nlecturer in the large college for training writers and speakers in\r\nMoscow. This school was running full blast while I was there. Classes\r\nnumber from seventy-five to one hundred each. Pupils are elected by\r\nvarious Soviet organizations over the country, and at the end of six\r\nmonths’ training are returned to their various communities and others\r\nare sent into their places. The Government supports all these pupils\r\nwhile they are in training.\r\n\r\nReinstein is an excellent speaker and a tireless worker, and is one of\r\nthe kindest and most conscientious men I have ever met. He is certainly\r\nnot the “wild-eyed agitator” he has been pictured in the American press.\r\nHe has given valuable service to the revolution, though he has lost\r\ntwenty-five pounds in doing so.\r\n\r\n                             “BILL” SHATOFF\r\n\r\n“Bill” Shatoff, described by American papers as “the well-known\r\nanarchist,” is one of the officials of the Soviet Army. When I was in\r\nPetrograd he was the commander of the Petrograd front. He is a big jolly\r\nRussian Jew, and certainly does not look any the worse for his\r\nparticipation in Soviet warfare, nor for the stinted rations he has\r\nshared with his men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  CHILDREN OF THE SOVIET SCHOOL AT DIETSKOE SELO\r\n\r\n  Formerly Tsarskoe Selo, the residence of the Czar\r\n]\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n                           WOMEN AND CHILDREN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Education of the children occupies as important a place in the\r\nadministration of the Soviet Government as the maintenance of the Red\r\nArmy. The Budget for education and child welfare is unstinted, and at\r\nevery turn one encounters evidence of actual accomplishment in the\r\ninterest of the growing generation. “First we must defend the workers’\r\nstate against its enemies,” said a Commissar to me, “then we must\r\nprepare the coming generation to carry on and develop the state won for\r\nthem by the Red Army.”\r\n\r\nIn the two years of the revolution 10,000 new schools had been opened.\r\nThere were but few children in Soviet Russia who are not attending\r\nclasses in grades from kindergarten to high school. I saw few children\r\nidling indoors or out during school hours, nor did I see any at work in\r\nthe factories. They troop out from the schools in great bands into the\r\nparks at recess hour. Teachers complained to me of the lack of\r\ntext-books, due to the scarcity of paper. They resented bitterly, too,\r\nthe necessity of assembling their charges in cold class-rooms.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of meagre facilities, every one connected with the\r\ngovernment worked hard to make every possible provision for the care and\r\nprotection of the children. The government was feeding 359,000 children\r\ndaily in the schools in Moscow, and 200,000 in Petrograd. The most\r\nnourishing food obtainable was requisitioned for the children. Milk,\r\nbutter and eggs went first to hospitals and to the school restaurants,\r\nwhere the children were provided with food free. Only when there was an\r\nextra supply were healthy adults permitted to purchase these foods.\r\n\r\nI used to watch the children, happy, robust little folk, going from\r\ntheir class-rooms in great crowds to the restaurants, where they sat in\r\nrows at the long tables. The noon recess lasted for two hours—one hour\r\nfor eating and one for play. The children were chaperoned by their\r\nteachers, of whom there were two for each roomful of pupils. One looked\r\nafter the mental studies, while the other directed their physical\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nThe children of kindergarten age were called for in the mornings by\r\ntheir teachers, and were brought home by them at about four o’clock in\r\nthe afternoon. At least ninety-five percent of the teachers were women,\r\nand they had all received special training for their profession.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet law prohibits the employment of children under sixteen years,\r\nexcept in cases of greatest necessity. Child labor under fourteen is\r\nforbidden. Children between fourteen and eighteen permitted to enter\r\ncertain industries are not allowed to work more than four hours a day;\r\nbetween sixteen and eighteen they may work not more than six hours\r\ndaily, and all must spend two hours in school.\r\n\r\nWith much of the work of preparing meals and the care of children of\r\nschool age taken away from them, the women of Russia were enjoying a new\r\nfreedom. They had found themselves suddenly with time to work away from\r\nhome. They rushed into industry and the professions and set to work with\r\nan ardor and enthusiasm that has done much to establish the Soviet\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWomen conductors were employed on the street-cars in all the cities in\r\nthe daytime, men being employed only at night. Women police also were\r\nemployed, and no one seemed to think this extraordinary.\r\n\r\nHousekeepers were accorded the same right to vote as factory workers. If\r\na married woman had a desire to work elsewhere than in her home she did\r\nso, and took her meals with her husband and friends in a Soviet\r\nrestaurant. Women shared in the discussions in the Soviet, and were\r\nelected to offices. Far from being “nationalized,” women were accorded\r\nthe same respect and treatment as men.\r\n\r\nThe right of inheritance has been abolished, although dependents such as\r\nminors unable to work, or invalids, are supported out of the property of\r\nthe deceased former owner, and no discrimination is made against\r\nchildren born out of wedlock.\r\n\r\nThe government recognizes only civil marriages, but an additional\r\nreligious ceremony is optional with the contracting parties and is not\r\nrestricted in any way by the government. An oral or written statement of\r\nthe parties desiring to contract the marriage is required by the nearest\r\nDepartment of Registration. Boys under eighteen and girls under sixteen\r\nare prohibited from marrying, and the laws of consanguinity in force in\r\nother countries are observed in Russia also. Births must be registered\r\nin the Department of Registration nearest the mother’s residence, and\r\nchildren born out of wedlock have the same status as those born of a\r\nregistered union.\r\n\r\nDivorces are granted on the petition of either or both parties. When the\r\npetition is mutual the persons are obliged to state what surnames the\r\nchildren of the marriage are expected to bear in future. In case only\r\none party petitions, the surname of the children and the responsibility\r\nfor maintenance are decided by the judge.\r\n\r\nIn Moscow I visited a lying-in hospital under the Division of Motherhood\r\nand Infants, of the Department of Social Welfare. This was one of many\r\nsimilar institutions this department had established in all the large\r\nand many of the small cities. Here the working women receive care and\r\nnourishment without cost for several weeks before and after child-birth.\r\nThey have the best food and medical treatment obtainable, and are paid\r\ntheir full wages during the time they are out of their accustomed\r\nemployment. In connection with this hospital in Moscow, which was\r\nestablished in an imposing white stone structure formerly an _élite_\r\nfinishing school where the daughters of the rich learned French and the\r\ngentle arts, there was a training college where five hundred young\r\nwomen, chosen by various trade and peasant organizations throughout the\r\ncountry, were attending a six months’ course of lectures and practical\r\ndemonstrations on obstetrics and the care of children. Already three\r\nclasses of five hundred each had been graduated and sent back to their\r\nrespective communities to apply their experience and to train others.\r\n\r\nMoving pictures were shown daily, portraying to the mothers the best\r\nmethods of bathing, dressing, and caring for their infants, and these\r\nwere supplemented with lectures. Older children of working mothers were\r\ncared for during the day in government nurseries, where they were given\r\nthe best possible care and attention.\r\n\r\nThe following is a table showing the record of the accomplishments in\r\nthis department in the year 1919.\r\n\r\n                MATERNITY AND CHILD WELFARE INSTITUTIONS\r\n In Moscow and the principal government towns, from returns received in\r\n    October, 1918, and July, 1919\r\n\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n                                                          Ambulatoriums\r\n                  Asylums for    Asylums for               for Newborn\r\n CITIES             Newborn        Children                  Children\r\n                    Children     From 1 to 3   Crèches    Consultations\r\n                   ----------------------------------------------------\r\n                   1918  1919   1918  1919    1918  1919   1918  1919\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n Moscow               1    2      2     6       4    26      8    17\r\n Yaroslav             1    1     ..    ..       1     3     ..     2\r\n Kostroma             1    2     ..     1       2     2     ..     2\r\n Ivanovna-Voznesensk ..    1     ..     1       2     3     ..    ..\r\n Tula                 1    1     ..     1      ..     1     ..    ..\r\n Saratov              1    1     ..     1      ..    ..      3     4\r\n Voronezh             1    1     ..     1      ..    ..      1     1\r\n Tver                 1    8     ..     6       3     6     ..     2\r\n Tambov               1    9     ..     7       2     2      1     1\r\n Minsk                1    2     ..     1      ..     2      1     2\r\n Kaluga               1    1     ..     4       2     6     ..     1\r\n Vitebsk              1    1     ..     1      ..    ..      1     2\r\n Tomsk                1    1     ..     1      ..    ..      1     4\r\n                     --   --     --    --      --    --     --    --\r\n TOTAL               12   31      2    31      16    51     16    38\r\n\r\n                                   Asylums for\r\n                                  Mothers with\r\n CITIES                              Newborn\r\n                   Milk Kitchens    Children\r\n                   ---------------------------\r\n                   1918  1919      1918  1919\r\n ---------------------------------------------\r\n Moscow               8   10           1   3\r\n Yaroslav            ..    1          ..  ..\r\n Kostroma            ..    1          ..   1\r\n Ivanovna-Voznesensk ..    2          ..  ..\r\n Tula                ..    ..         ..  ..\r\n Saratov              3    4          ..   1\r\n Voronezh             1    1           1   2\r\n Tver                ..    ..         ..  ..\r\n Tambov               1    1          ..  ..\r\n Minsk                1    2          ..  ..\r\n Kaluga              ..    1          ..  ..\r\n Vitebsk              1    2          ..  ..\r\n Tomsk               ..    4          ..  ..\r\n                     --   --          --  --\r\n TOTAL               15   29           2   7\r\n\r\nMore than 2,500 libraries had been established throughout the country\r\nsince the revolution. All the larger towns have their high schools,\r\ntechnical schools, and musical conservatories.\r\n\r\nAs every able-bodied adult must work in Soviet Russia, I wondered who\r\nwent to the advanced technical schools. Each local Soviet elected its\r\ngroup of students to attend schools for special training for terms\r\nvarying from three to six months. At the end of the training the\r\nstudents returned to their communities to teach, and a new group was\r\nsent for similar training. The schools were free; the students were\r\nfurnished with food, clothing, living quarters and books, and were\r\nprovided with tickets for theatres, concerts and other entertainments.\r\nAll students were granted loans, to be used for spending money while in\r\nschool, if they preferred to purchase their own clothing and other\r\nnecessaries. In Moscow the average loan was 1,200 rubles, varying\r\naccording to the rise or fall of the ruble’s value.\r\n\r\nThroughout the country homes for the aged had been established where men\r\nover sixty and women over fifty were cared for by the government,\r\nprovided they did not have children or relatives who wished to keep them\r\nin their own homes. In the latter case they were given adequate\r\npensions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MRS. LENIN VISITING A SOVIET SCHOOL\r\n\r\n  The children, under the supervision of their teacher, are busy in the\r\n    garden.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI found less of the “institution” atmosphere in these homes than in\r\nthose I have seen in other countries. Books, pictures, a meeting-room,\r\nand dining-room, and a general atmosphere of comfort and freedom seemed\r\nto make the elderly people content and happy. They are not considered\r\n“paupers” or “charges on the state,” but human beings who have\r\ncontributed their service to society and are entitled to all the peace\r\nand comfort society can give them.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt upon the organization and spirit of the Red Army and upon\r\nthe education and care of the children more than upon anything else,\r\nbecause these are the things that made the strongest impression upon me\r\nduring my stay in Soviet Russia. They stand out above all else in the\r\nmemory of weeks crowded with a multitude of rapid and various\r\nobservations. The soldiers and the children come first in the\r\nconsideration of the government. Here the greatest ingenuity and energy\r\nhave been applied, and here the best results are evident. It has been\r\nthe purpose of the Soviet leaders to make the first line of defense—the\r\narmy—unconquerable. Government officials claim they have succeeded in\r\nthis, and point to the map as evidence. The children, they say, are the\r\nstrategical reserves of the communist state. They are aiming to keep\r\nthem healthy in body, despite the privations imposed by the blockade,\r\nand to develop them mentally and physically to carry on the future\r\nstate. No one can deny the large measure of success realized.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n                  GOVERNMENT INDUSTRY AND AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n                            THE SOVIET STATE\r\n\r\nThe All-Russian Congress of Soviets is composed of representatives of\r\nurban Soviets, one delegate for 25,000 voters, and of rural Soviets, one\r\ndelegate for 125,000 inhabitants. This Congress is convoked at least\r\ntwice a year. There had already been six meetings. The Congress elects\r\nan All-Russian Central Executive Committee of not more than two hundred\r\nmembers, which is the supreme power of the republic, in all periods\r\nbetween convocations of the Congress. It directs in a general way the\r\nactivities of the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, considers and\r\nenacts all measures or proposals introduced by the Soviet of Peoples’\r\nCommissars, convokes the Congress of Soviets, and forms a Council of\r\nPeople’s Commissars. This council in turn is entrusted with the general\r\nmanagement of the affairs of the republic and in this capacity issues\r\ndecrees, resolutions and orders, notifying the Central Executive\r\nCommittee immediately of all such orders or decrees.\r\n\r\nThere are seventeen of these Commissars, (1) Foreign Affairs, (2) Army,\r\n(3) Navy, (4) Interior, (5) Justice, (6) Labor, (7) Social Welfare, (8)\r\nEducation, (9) Post and Telegraph, (10) National Affairs, (11) Finances,\r\n(12) Ways of Communication, (13) Agriculture, (14) Commerce and\r\nIndustry, (15) National Supplies, (16) Supreme Soviet of National\r\nEconomy, (17) Public Health. Each Commissar has a collegium, or\r\ncommittee, the members of which are appointed by the Council of People’s\r\nCommissars, of which body Lenin is the president.\r\n\r\nThese committees act as the administrators of the nation, dealing with\r\nratification and amendments to the constitution; the general interior\r\nand foreign policy of the republic; boundaries; the admission or\r\nsecessions of new members; the establishing or changing of weights,\r\nmeasures, or money denominations; declarations of war or peace treaties;\r\nloans, commercial agreements or treaties; taxes; military affairs;\r\nlegislation and judicial procedure; civil and criminal procedure; and\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nLocal affairs are administered by local Soviets, in the following order:\r\nRural Soviets, of ten or less than ten members, send one delegate to the\r\nrural congress, which in turn sends one delegate for each ten of its\r\nmembers to the County Soviet Congress. This County Soviet Congress sends\r\none delegate for each 1,000 inhabitants (though not more than three\r\nhundred in all may be sent) to the Provincial Soviet Congress, which is\r\nmade up of representatives of both urban and rural Soviets. The\r\nProvincial Soviet Congress sends from its body one representative for\r\n10,000 inhabitants of the rural districts, and one for each 2,000 voters\r\nin the city, to the Regional Soviet Congress. This Congress sends one\r\ndelegate for each 125,000 inhabitants to the All-Russian Congress of\r\nSoviets.\r\n\r\nAll these Congresses of Soviets elect their own executive committees for\r\nhandling local affairs, but in small rural districts questions are\r\ndecided at general meetings of the voters whenever possible. The\r\nfunctions of the local Congresses of Soviets and deputies are given thus\r\nin the Constitution: To carry out all orders of the respective higher\r\norgans of the Soviet Power; to take all steps for raising the cultural\r\nand economic standard of the given territory; to decide all questions of\r\nlocal importance within their respective territories; and to coordinate\r\nall Soviet activity in their respective territories.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, the Supreme Council of National Economy, which is\r\nestablished under the Council of the People’s Commissars, deals with the\r\norganization and distribution of production. It coordinates the\r\nactivities of the federal and the local Soviets, and has the right of\r\nconfiscation, requisition, or compulsory syndication of various branches\r\nof industry and commerce; it determines the amount of raw materials and\r\nfuel needed, obtains and distributes them, and organizes and supplies\r\nthe rural economy. It works in close and constant touch with the\r\nAll-Russian Professional Alliances, and under its direction the latter\r\nconstantly regulates the wage scales in accordance with the rise and\r\nfall of prices of commodities. When I was in Moscow the average wage\r\npaid was 3,000 rubles per month, and in Petrograd 3,500. A member of the\r\nCouncil of People’s Commissars received 4,500 per month, out of which he\r\nhad to pay rent and buy food and clothing. Lenin, as president, received\r\nthe same amount, which was equivalent to about $180 in American money.\r\n\r\nAll men and women of the republic belonging to the following classes are\r\nallowed to vote after their eighteenth year: Individuals doing\r\nproductive or useful work; all persons engaged in housekeeping which\r\nenables others to do productive work; peasants who employ no help in\r\nagricultural labor; soldiers of the army and sailors of the navy;\r\ncitizens who are incapacited for work; and foreigners who live in and\r\nare working for the republic.\r\n\r\nSuffrage and candidacy are denied to persons who employ labor in order\r\nto obtain profits; persons who live on an income, such as interest from\r\ncapital, receipts from property, etc.; private merchants, trade or\r\ncommercial brokers; monks and clergy of all denominations;[A] employees\r\nand agents of the former police, gendarmes, or secret service; persons\r\nunder legal guardianship, or who have been declared by law as demented\r\nor mentally deficient; and persons who have been deprived of their\r\nrights of citizenship by a Soviet, for selfish or dishonorable offences\r\nfor the term fixed by the Soviet.\r\n\r\nThe Church has been separated from the State and the School from the\r\nChurch, but the right of religious or anti-religious propaganda is\r\naccorded to every citizen. The government press has been freed from all\r\ndependence upon capital in the form of advertising, and all the\r\ntechnical and material means for publication, as well as for the\r\npublication of books and pamphlets are free. Furnished halls, with\r\nheating and lighting free, are given to the poorest peasantry for\r\nmeeting-places.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote A:\r\n\r\n  There have been some modifications of this regulation recently. I have\r\n  heard since my return to America that clergymen are given the right to\r\n  vote provided they are supported by the workers and not from\r\n  endowments.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                          LAND NATIONALIZATION\r\n\r\nThe brief Land Decree of November 7, 1917, was replaced in September,\r\n1918, by “The Fundamental Law of Socialization of the Land,” which has\r\nalready been enforced throughout the country except in the cases of land\r\nowned by peasants and worked by the owner and his family. This land\r\ndecree has been enforced gradually, and perhaps less completely than any\r\nother of the Soviet decrees, first because the energies of the\r\nGovernment were diverted to a war of defence, and secondly, because the\r\nland question would naturally take the longest to settle even in times\r\nof peace.\r\n\r\nThe land decree provides that all property rights in land, minerals,\r\noil, gas, peat, medicinal springs, waters, timber and other natural\r\nresources be abolished and the land given to the use of the entire\r\nlaboring population, without open or secret compensation to former\r\nowners. The right to use this land belongs to those who till it by their\r\nown labor, and is not restricted by sex, religion, nationality, or\r\nforeign citizenship. Under-surface deposits, timber, etc., are at the\r\ndisposal of the Soviet powers, local or federal, and all live stock and\r\nagricultural implements are to be taken over without indemnification by\r\nthe land departments of the Soviets. Infants, or minors, cripples,\r\ninvalids, or aged persons who would be deprived of their means of\r\nsubsistence by the enforcement of this decree are pensioned either for\r\nlife or until they attain their majority. Minors are given the same\r\npension as soldiers.\r\n\r\nLand may be used for cultural and educational purposes; for agricultural\r\npurposes, communities, associations, village organizations, individuals\r\nand families; and for industrial, commercial and transportation\r\nenterprises under the control of the Soviet power. It is given to those\r\nwho wish to work it for themselves, to local agricultural workers whose\r\nplots are now too small, or who have been employed by land owners, and\r\nto immigrants who come from towns or cities in order to work on the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWhen the land was turned over to the peasants each one seized the\r\nopportunity to establish his own little homestead. Since that time the\r\npeasants have discovered the benefits of cooperative agricultural\r\nproduction, and have established their own agricultural communes all\r\nover the country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ONE OF THE MANY TRAINS CIRCULATING SOVIET PROPAGANDA\r\nTHROUGHOUT RUSSIA]\r\n\r\nIn the Orel Government there were 391 of these communes, covering 39,000\r\ndessiatins,[B] with a population of 29,000 people. In the province of\r\nMoghilev there were 225, with more than 11,000 people and 40,000\r\ndessiatins of land. In the Vitebsk government there were 214, covering\r\n60,000 dessiatins of land with a population of 60,000. In the province\r\nof Novgorod there were 72, with 11,376 inhabitants and 22,253\r\ndessiatins. In Kaluga 150, with 6,500 inhabitants, covering 12,000\r\ndessiatins. Officials estimated that this number would be doubled before\r\nthe end of 1919. In the Petrograd Government 830 communes were\r\norganized, with 17,000 dessiatins and 15,313 inhabitants, all of whom\r\nwere laborers. In Tula there were 78, with 5,465 workers, and 8,554\r\ndessiatins of land.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote B:\r\n\r\n  A dessiatin is approximately 2.7 acres.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                               LABOR LAWS\r\n\r\nThe Soviet Russian Code of Labor Laws passed by the Russian Central\r\nExecutive Committee in 1919 covers the whole field of Russian labor\r\nactivities. To workers in other countries some of the provisions will\r\nappear drastic, but it must be remembered that Russia is still an armed\r\ncamp and that the war has disorganized industry, transportation and\r\nalmost every other form of endeavor. I was informed that every effort\r\nwas being made under these laws to coordinate the productive forces of\r\nthe country with a view to securing the highest possible production for\r\nthe pressing needs of the Russian people. When the war stops, as it no\r\ndoubt will in the immediate future, Soviet Russia will be faced with the\r\nproblem of diverting into productive channels its three million\r\nsoldiers, as well as other millions now engaged directly or indirectly\r\nin the war. Just as we had our “Work or Fight” measures in this country\r\nfor the purpose of utilizing the nation’s human energy in a profitable\r\nway in time of stress, so in Soviet Russia every effort is being made to\r\nplace the workers where the greatest results to the nation as a whole\r\nwill accrue.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the passage of these labor laws, it must be borne in\r\nmind that the working people in Soviet Russia enjoy much more control at\r\nthe present time than do the same class of people in possibly any other\r\ncountry. One must take into consideration the fact that these laws were\r\ninitiated by the unions themselves or their representatives, who shared\r\njointly with the political side of the Government the responsibility for\r\nmaintaining the new order. Many of the former so-called bourgeoisie of\r\nthe old regime, I was informed, have spent the past two years doing\r\nnothing but live by speculation and they stir up trouble on the\r\nslightest pretext against the new Government. It was primarily to reach\r\nrecalcitrants of this character that the compulsory provisions were\r\ninserted in the code. The result of the passage of these laws did not,\r\nso far as I could judge, diminish the enthusiasm of the Russian workers\r\nfor the new order, but on the other hand their energy seems to have been\r\nstimulated, no doubt because they were beginning to feel that through\r\ntheir various organizations this step had been taken for the express\r\npurpose of forcing into production every man and woman in the country\r\ncapable of producing and helping to reconstruct Russia.\r\n\r\nArticle I of the code deals with compulsory labor. It provides that all\r\ncitizens of the Soviet Republic, with the following exceptions, are\r\nsubject to compulsory labor:\r\n\r\nFirst, persons under sixteen years of age; second, all persons over\r\nfifty years of age; third, persons who have become incapacitated by\r\ninjury or illness; fourth, women for a period of eight weeks before and\r\neight weeks after confinement.\r\n\r\nAll students are subject to compulsory labor at the schools. Labor\r\nconditions in all establishments, Soviet, nationalized, public and\r\nprivate, are regulated by tariff rules drafted by the trade unions in\r\nagreement with the directors or owners of establishments and enterprises\r\nand approved by the people’s commissariat of labor.\r\n\r\nArticle II, entitled “The Right to Work,” provides that all citizens\r\nable to work have the right to employment at their vocations and\r\nremuneration fixed for such class of work. The district exchange bureaus\r\nof the Department of Labor Distribution, in agreement with respective\r\nunions, assign individual wage earners or groups of them to work at\r\nother trades if there is no demand for labor at the vocation of the\r\npersons in question. All persons of the female sex and those of the male\r\nsex under eighteen years of age have no right to work at night or in\r\nthose industries in which the conditions of labor are especially hard or\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nArticle III, provides for the methods of labor distribution. Any wage\r\nearner who is not engaged on work at his vocation shall register at the\r\nLocal Department of Labor Distribution as unemployed. An unemployed\r\nperson has no right to refuse an offer of work at his vocation,\r\nproviding the working conditions conform with the standards fixed by the\r\nrespective tariff regulations, or, in the absence of the same, by the\r\ntrades unions. An unemployed person who is offered work outside his\r\nvocation shall be obliged to accept it on the understanding, if he so\r\nwishes, that this be only until he receives work at his vocation.\r\n\r\nArticle V, makes provision for the transfer of a wage earner to other\r\nwork within the enterprise, establishment or institution where he is\r\nemployed. His transfer may be ordered by the managing authorities of\r\nsaid enterprise, establishment or institution. The decision of the\r\nDepartment of Labor in the matter of a transfer of labor may be appealed\r\nfrom under the law by the interested parties to the District Department\r\nof Labor or to the People’s Commissariat of Labor, whose decision of the\r\nmatter in dispute is final. In case of urgent public work the Department\r\nof Labor, in agreement with the respective professional unions, may\r\norder the transfer of a whole group of wage earners from the\r\norganization where they are employed to another situated in the same or\r\na different locality. This is done, provided a sufficient number of\r\nvolunteers for such work cannot be found.\r\n\r\nUnder Article VI, which covers remuneration of labor, the law provides\r\nthat in working out tariff rates and determining the standard rates of\r\nremuneration all wage earners of a trade shall be divided into groups of\r\nskill, and a definite standard of remuneration shall be fixed for each\r\ngroup. In determining the standard of remuneration for each category,\r\nconsideration must be given to the kind of labor, the danger of the\r\nconditions under which the work is performed, the complexity and\r\naccuracy of the work. Remuneration for piece-work is computed by\r\ndividing the daily tariff rate by the number of pieces constituting the\r\nproduction standard. Remuneration for overtime work shall not exceed\r\ntime and a half. During illness of a wage earner the remuneration due\r\nhim shall be paid as a subsidy from the hospital fund. The unemployed\r\nreceive a subsidy out of the funds for unemployed.\r\n\r\nUnder Article VII, which deals with working hours, provision is made\r\nthat the duration of a normal working day must in no case exceed eight\r\nhours for day work and seven hours for night work, and that the duration\r\nof a normal day, first, for persons under eighteen years of age, and\r\nsecond, for persons working in especially hard or health-endangering\r\nbranches of industry, must not exceed six hours. In case the nature of\r\nthe work is such that it requires a working day in excess of the normal,\r\ntwo or more shifts shall be engaged. Except in extreme cases work in\r\nexcess of the normal hours, or what is usually called overtime work, is\r\nnot permitted. No females and no males under eighteen years of age may\r\ndo any overtime work, and the time spent by those on such work in the\r\ncourse of two consecutive days must not exceed four hours. All wage\r\nearners must be allowed a weekly uninterrupted rest of not less than\r\nforty-two hours, and on the eve of rest days the normal working day is\r\nreduced by two hours. Every wage earner who has worked without\r\ninterruption not less than six months shall be entitled to leave of\r\nabsence for two weeks, and every wage earner who has worked without\r\ninterruption not less than a year shall be entitled to leave of absence\r\nfor not less than one month with full pay.\r\n\r\nArticle VIII deals with methods to insure efficiency of labor. The\r\nstandard output for wage earners of each trade and group is fixed by\r\nvaluation commissions of the respective trades unions. This article\r\nprovides that a wage earner systematically producing less than the fixed\r\nstandard may be transferred by the decision of the proper valuation\r\ncommission to other work in the same group and category, or to a lower\r\ngroup or category with a corresponding reduction of wages. However,\r\nappeal can be taken from this provision of the law as well as all other\r\nprovisions in the code.\r\n\r\nArticle IX provides for protection of life, health and labor of persons\r\nengaged in any economic activity, and the carrying out of this part of\r\nthe law is entrusted to labor inspectors, technical inspectors and the\r\nrepresentatives of sanitary inspection. The labor inspection is under\r\nthe jurisdiction of the People’s Commissariat of Labor and its local\r\nbranches, which are the Departments of Labor, and is composed of labor\r\ninspectors, elected by the councils of professional unions. The\r\ninspectors are compelled under the law to visit at any time of the day\r\nor night all the industrial enterprises of their district and all places\r\nwhere work is carried on, as well as places provided for the workmen by\r\nthe enterprises, such as rooming-houses, asylums, baths, etc., and to\r\nassist the trades unions and works committee in their efforts to\r\nameliorate in individual enterprises as well as in branches of industry.\r\n\r\nThis brief outline of the Code of Labor Laws, the full text of which\r\nwill be found in the appendix, shows how thoroughly the new régime in\r\nRussia has gone into the question of organizing the labor power of the\r\ncountry for production on the highest scale. I was told over and over\r\nagain by various officials of the labor organizations of Soviet Russia\r\nand the Government officials as well, that what they were interested in\r\nabove all else at the present time was the organization of labor along\r\nlines that would insure sufficient production of essential commodities\r\nto meet the needs of all the people under Soviet rule.\r\n\r\n                             TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nBefore the war there were in Russia 37,000 railway locomotives. At the\r\nend of the war 13,000 were left. Of these, at the time of the Brest\r\nLitovsk treaty, thirty-five percent were disabled. In the spring of 1919\r\nthe total number of disabled locomotives amounted to fifty percent.\r\nSince that time there has been some improvement, and last August only\r\nforty-seven percent of them were disabled. There is a great demand for\r\nlocomotives. Russia could use to advantage the entire product of the\r\nUnited States for the next six years. Approximately the same conditions\r\nprevail with reference to cars.\r\n\r\nPractically the whole transportation system was given over to the\r\nmovement of troops and army supplies. In certain sections of the country\r\nthere was a surplus of grain, but no facilities to transport it to the\r\ncities.\r\n\r\nOn the last stage of the journey to Moscow I had a vivid glimpse into\r\nthe transportation problem of Soviet Russia. Two or three hours out of\r\nSmolensk we stopped at a small way station and hooked on seventeen cars\r\nloaded with wood intended to relieve the critical fuel shortage in\r\nMoscow. After five or six hours’ journey, with only brief stops, the\r\ntrain made a prolonged halt. I got out to learn the cause of the delay.\r\nThe cars loaded with wood had been uncoupled from the train and men were\r\nbusy throwing the billets into the field by the track. The station was\r\ncrowded with soldiers. Word had been received to rush reinforcements\r\nsouthward to meet the advance of Denikin. These cars were needed to\r\ncarry the troops.\r\n\r\n“What about the wood?” I asked, “Isn’t it needed in Moscow?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” was the reply. “The nights are getting very cold in Moscow. But\r\nMoscow must wait. The army comes first.”\r\n\r\nSuch incidents were happening daily, hourly, no doubt, all over Russia.\r\nAlways, they complained, the necessities of the war and the mobilization\r\nhampered the productive enterprises of the nation.\r\n\r\n                                INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nWhile I was in Moscow the Government received a report from the Supreme\r\nCouncil of National Economy to the effect that war industry was\r\nprogressing at full speed and producing sufficient supplies and\r\nammunitions for the army. In addition the departments of building\r\nmaterials, fur, leather, fuel, metal, chemicals, and trade, had been\r\norganized. There were fifty-one factories in the building material\r\nbranch alone, capable of producing 121,500,000 bricks, 2,000,000 poods\r\nof cement, 870,000 poods of lime, and 510,000 poods of tiles. The\r\ntanneries were running on the basis of 240,800 poods annually. The\r\ndepartment of forests had obtained a contract for twenty percent of the\r\nfuel demand, in the Moscow Government alone. There were sixty-eight saw\r\nmills and 128 planing mills running on full time. All paper factories\r\nwere working. The chemical department controls the paper, china, and\r\nchemical production. The trade department supervised 175,000 workers and\r\nhad its own art industry museum.\r\n\r\nThe Government is planning the construction of enormous power systems,\r\none of which will be the largest in the world. They will also utilize\r\nthe water falls for great hydraulic power stations, all of which would\r\nrequire great amounts of machinery from America.\r\n\r\n                                 CANALS\r\n\r\nThe Volga and Don canal will connect the Black and Caspian Seas and the\r\nVolga river with the Baltic Sea. Canal Dredges are needed to build\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n                             RAW MATERIALS\r\n\r\nThere are at present in warehouses in Russia 200,000 tons of flax, the\r\npresent market price of which, in London, is over $1,000 per ton. There\r\nare also 100,000 tons of hemp. There is gold, timber, and ninety percent\r\nof the world’s supply of platinum.\r\n\r\nMany factories will be erected, great rolling mills, steel mills, etc.\r\nThere is no doubt but that Russia will eventually be able to produce\r\neverything it needs. The country is thoroughly stocked with all kinds of\r\nmineral products and it is merely a matter of time before it will be\r\nentirely independent. It struck me that in the meantime the American\r\nbusiness men are missing a wonderful opportunity in these ready markets\r\nfor their machinery and equipment. Russia will be, in the course of a\r\nvery few years, a very strong competitor, whereas now it offers a vast\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n                               PROPAGANDA\r\n\r\n\r\nOn my way into Red Russia the train on which I was travelling passed,\r\nbetween Rejistza and Novo-Sokoliev, a train of ten or twelve cars, the\r\nsides of which were covered with huge, multi-colored placards. It was\r\nthe “Lenin Train” used for carrying propaganda literature all over the\r\nrepublic. When I saw it, it was on a tour of the country behind the\r\nWestern Front.\r\n\r\nThe train was decorated with great paintings in bright colors and with\r\nrevolutionary inscriptions. In one of the cars was a moving picture\r\napparatus and screen; another was fitted up as a book shop; and a third\r\nas a telegraph station which posted the latest news bulletins at every\r\nstation, and circulated news from the front and from the rest of the\r\nworld. The train carried representatives from government departments and\r\na staff of speakers and lecturers.\r\n\r\nIt had been in constant service for about two months, during which time\r\nit travelled through the districts of Pskov, Vitebsk, Lettonia, White\r\nRussia, Lithuania, and Kharkov, covering some 3,590 versts. In all the\r\nstations and towns through which it passed, leaflets, pamphlets and\r\nbooks were distributed. Meetings were arranged and lectures given, and\r\nthe Commissary representatives visited the Soviet institutions offering\r\nsuggestions and aid. Workers and peasants assembled about the train and\r\nlistened to speeches made from the roofs of cars and gathered bundles of\r\nliterature to be distributed in the villages and workshops. They told of\r\ntheir difficulties to the speakers and asked them for their advice.\r\n\r\nIn America I had always heard so much about the illiteracy of the\r\nRussian peasants that I wondered what use quantities of reading matter\r\nwould be to them. I discovered that illiteracy was not nearly so general\r\nas popularly supposed, and was decreasing rapidly under the government’s\r\nenergetic educational program. In every community there is at least one\r\nwho can read and write. Russians live in villages everywhere; even on\r\nthe plains or steppes such a thing as an isolated farmhouse or workman’s\r\ncottage is rare. The farmer may, and often does, have to go some\r\ndistance to work his land, but his home is always among other homes.\r\nWhen literatures arrives those who can, read aloud. The others gather\r\naround the reader to listen. Long discussions, so dearly loved by the\r\nRussians, follow.\r\n\r\nThe “Lenin Train” was preceded by telegraphic announcements of its\r\ncoming, so there was a crowd to meet it at every station. Sometimes the\r\nreception was very ceremonious. At Rejistza, where it arrived at night,\r\nit was met with banners, music and torches. At a tiny station,\r\nMalinooka, a crowd of peasants from the nearby villages was waiting to\r\nreceive their literature and “to hear directly from the seat of their\r\ngovernment.” I learned that five more similar trains were being prepared\r\nto be put on the Volga and its tributaries, and motor-trucks to be sent\r\ninto the sections where neither railways nor waterways entered. One was\r\nto be called “The October Revolution,” another “The Communist,” and a\r\nthird “The Red Army.” The others were not yet named. Boats too were used\r\nfor that purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was easy to understand why these people, beset on all sides, were\r\ncarrying on propaganda to defend their country. But I found that their\r\npropaganda did not end with this defensive material. By far the greater\r\nproportion of it was what might be called cultural. It was intended not\r\nonly to waken the people to a realization that their own lives were\r\nthreatened, but to teach them that they were a part of the great world\r\nthat lay outside their own land. The art, the music, the literature and\r\nthe science of the world was brought to them in simple form so that they\r\ncould comprehend it and be stimulated to further reading and study.\r\nWhatever else the Russians may be they are not materialistic. I found\r\nthem more eager for news and knowledge than for food, of which they got\r\nso little. Whatever news is obtained from the outside world is\r\ndisseminated at once, by telegraph and bulletins, to all parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nAt the town of Praele a Bolshevist soldier said to me with a twinkle in\r\nhis eye, “You have a great country in America.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you think it a great country?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“They are shooting negroes in Chicago and Washington now,” was his\r\nanswer; “and that’s the country that talks about Soviet Russia being\r\nbarbarous.”\r\n\r\nNaturally I was interested in the confirmation or refutation of the\r\nreports I had heard, that the Bolsheviki intend to spread their\r\npropaganda all over the world. Soviet officials talked frankly to me\r\nabout prisoners and propaganda. They liked to take prisoners, they said.\r\nThey only wished they had more food so that they could afford to take\r\nmore of them. They didn’t want them to starve. They would like to take a\r\nmillion prisoners a day if they had enough food and paper. “After all,”\r\nthey said, “our war is primarily a war of education.”\r\n\r\nAt many points along the battlefronts I saw great banners stretched\r\nbetween posts, with letters large enough to be read a hundred yards\r\naway, telling the other side what the war was about. One, which I had\r\ntranslated for me on the Lettish front, read, “The Germans are marching\r\non Riga. German soldiers are helping you to destroy the working class\r\nrepublic in Russia. If you want to defend Lettland go back and drive the\r\nGermans out of Riga.” The Russians placed great reliance on this\r\nbattlefront propaganda. I found evidence in the Lettish ranks of the\r\neffectiveness of these tactics.\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast to the enthusiasm of the Soviet officials for this\r\npropaganda at the fighting front, and their reliance upon it to achieve\r\nimportant military results, was their seeming indifference to propaganda\r\nabroad. They were anxious enough that the case for the Russian\r\nrevolution and the Soviet Government should be presented to the people\r\nof other countries, but they displayed none of that eager confidence in\r\ntheir ability to stir revolution abroad with which they are commonly\r\ncredited. They believed that by means of propaganda they could break the\r\nmorale of any army brought against them; but they did not pretend to be\r\nable to subvert remote governments. They were amused by the fear of\r\nBolshevik propaganda displayed in the foreign press. They were not\r\ninclined to rate their powers so highly. “To be sure,” they told me, “we\r\nare internationalists and revolutionists, but if other countries are not\r\nready for revolution how can we stimulate it? That is not our job. We\r\nhave had our revolution in Russia and we must bend all our energies to\r\npreserve it. The workers in other countries must take care of their own\r\naffairs.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “RED TERROR”\r\n\r\n  Execution of a Red Guard on an English gunboat in Lake Onega, Russia,\r\n    in the presence of\r\n  English and American Officers\r\n]\r\n\r\nThey were willing to give guarantees that the Soviet Government would\r\nnot engage in revolutionary propaganda abroad. They told me that they\r\nhad repeatedly assured foreign journalists and agents that their\r\ngovernments could take any measures they saw fit to protect themselves\r\nagainst Russian propaganda.\r\n\r\nOf propaganda in Russia itself there is plenty. I have already described\r\nthe propaganda among prisoners of war, and of its effect upon the\r\nEnglish prisoners in Moscow. I have no doubt the same “torture” was\r\nadministered to Americans in Siberia. I saw, in an American magazine, a\r\nstatement of a Canadian soldier that he and many of his comrades had\r\nbeen entirely converted to the doctrines of Bolshevism, but he\r\nattributed his conversion to actual experiences and to the things he saw\r\nrather than to anything he had read or been told. It occurs to an\r\nunprejudiced observer who has been in Soviet Russia that the nations\r\nthat feared the contagion of Bolshevist propaganda took the worst\r\npossible way of avoiding it when they sent their young soldiers into a\r\nland full of propaganda explaining and upholding the new order\r\nestablished there.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n                      COMING OUT OF SOVIET RUSSIA\r\n\r\n\r\nI was checked and guarded out of Red Russia in the same manner in which\r\nI had been checked and guarded into it. When I was ready to leave\r\nPetrograd, early in October, Zinovieff delegated as my guard and guide a\r\nshort, stocky Esthonian, Isaac Mikkal. As Grafman had reminded me of\r\nLarkin, so Mikkal reminded me of Tom Hickey, the famous Texas socialist.\r\nHe appeared rather pleased at my calling him “Hickey” which I did,\r\nthroughout the journey.\r\n\r\nWe left Petrograd at eleven o’clock at night, and arrived at Pskov the\r\nnext morning at eight, where we had to remain until five in the evening\r\nbefore we could get a train for Rejistza, which we reached at six the\r\nfollowing day. Here the division commandant stamped our papers and sent\r\nus on to Velikie Luki to the headquarters of the army command.\r\n\r\n“Hickey” had turned out to be a less aggressive and efficient guide than\r\nLarkin, and as he could give me little information about either the\r\ncountry we were passing through or the events that were taking place, I\r\nlonged often for my old friend whom I had left at Moscow weeks before.\r\nWith our papers stamped at Velikie Luki, we were allowed to go on to the\r\nfront without going through Smolensk, and I asked the commandant to give\r\nme a guide who understood that part of the Western Front, so that I\r\ncould proceed more swiftly. He granted this request, but said that\r\n“Hickey” must also be of the party, since he had been charged at\r\nPetrograd with my safe delivery and must make his report on his return\r\nto that city. After a brief telephone conversation, in Russian, the\r\ncommandant informed me that another guide would appear in less than a\r\nhalf hour. We had dinner and waited calmly. At the end of the stipulated\r\ntime my guide entered, and to my surprise and pleasure it was “Larkin.”\r\n\r\nHe stopped short, looked at me a moment, raised his hands to his head\r\nand brushed off his cap which fell to the floor. “God love a duck, is it\r\nyou? They told me there was a journalist here who wanted to go to the\r\nfront but if I had known it was you I would have said I was laid up with\r\ncholera.”\r\n\r\nI introduced my two guides and we went to the station, only to find that\r\nthe train we had expected to take at eleven that night would not go\r\nbefore five the next morning. There was nothing to do but climb in one\r\nof the coaches, but since the train was already full of soldiers,\r\ntalking, singing, and smoking, there was but little sleep for me that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nAt five in the morning we started—on time at last. The conductor\r\ninformed me that we would reach Rejistza at five in the afternoon, but\r\nwe did not arrive until four in the morning. I endeavored to learn from\r\nboth “Larkin” and “Hickey” the real reason for the delay, but they told\r\nme to “forget it. A few hours’ delay makes no difference to you, one way\r\nor the other.” At last “Larkin” must have grown very weary of my\r\nimportunities. At any rate he said, “Please remember you are in Russia\r\nand that we are at war. All trains are soldier trains. They must stop to\r\ntake on soldiers and to let soldiers off. They must stop to make\r\nrepairs. They must stop for many reasons. Don’t imagine you are in\r\nAmerica, on an express train. Some time when the war is over trains will\r\nrun on time, but now,—well stop kicking.” I stopped.\r\n\r\nIn Rejistza we learned that we must wait until four P.M. for a train\r\ngoing to the Dvinsk front. In the division commandant’s office we found\r\ntwo foreigners who had come across the front the night before. They were\r\non the way to Moscow, and were being checked in as I had been. The\r\ncommandant asked “Larkin,” whom he knew quite well, if he would take\r\nthem to Velikie Luki; and on “Larkin’s” saying that he had been\r\nentrusted with the task of seeing me to the front, the commandant told\r\nhim that “Hickey” could see me through. I was sorry to lose “Larkin,”\r\nbut there was nothing else to be done, and we parted with a cordial wish\r\nthat we might meet again under more favorable circumstances. “But, God\r\nlove a duck,—I hope you stay out of Russia until peace comes,” were his\r\nlast words to me.\r\n\r\nWhen “Hickey” and I finally reached Dvinsk the Poles were shelling the\r\ntown. The soldier train on which I was traveling stopped two miles\r\noutside the city and the soldiers detrained and began marching into\r\nDvinsk to reinforce their comrades. I did not wish to go through Dvinsk.\r\nOne experience under shell-fire had been sufficiently shocking to my\r\nnervous system, and it wasn’t my war at any rate. I protested to\r\n“Hickey” that he had been instructed to see me _safely_ across the\r\nfront, and demanded that he take me to some other point where I could\r\ncross. He told me that the papers read that I was to pass through the\r\nDvinsk front. I said that, papers to the contrary notwithstanding, I\r\nrefused to cross at Dvinsk. Poor “Hickey” crossed to an officer and held\r\na discussion, during which he made a few notes. At the conclusion of\r\ntheir talk he returned to me “If you _won’t_ go this way,” he told me,\r\n“we will have to go back on this train seventy-five versts and then\r\ndrive ten versts across country to the thirty-second division command to\r\nget your papers amended. Then you’ll have to return to the same station,\r\nwait for a train, ride forty versts, get off and drive twenty-two versts\r\nacross country to the brigade command of this division, and then from\r\nthere we will have to drive twenty versts more to the Soviet outposts,\r\nwhere you can get into the neutral zone and start for the Lettish\r\noutposts seventeen versts away.”\r\n\r\nAll my former desire for speedy travel and short cuts seemed to have\r\nevaporated. I yielded meekly to this decree and was, I believe, fairly\r\npatient during the two days it took us to carry out this long program.\r\nWhen we finally arrived at the Soviet front I was told to start down the\r\nroad and walk seventeen versts, which would bring me into Lettish\r\nterritory. Again my suitcase was heavy, or rather it was still heavy,\r\nand I protested that I could not walk so far and carry it. But no\r\nvehicles were available in that part of the country. My officer\r\ninformant pointed to a village two or three versts away, across a field,\r\nand said: “When you get to that village you may be able to hire a\r\nhay-rick.”\r\n\r\nEven that comparatively short walk did not appear attractive, but at\r\nthis particular moment there came around a bend in the road an old\r\nRussian driving a familiar hay-rick. He readily consented to take me to\r\nthe village, and after saying farewell to “Hickey,” and enjoining him to\r\n“keep smiling,” my aged saviour and I set out on our journey. A half\r\nhour later, in the village, I tried my best, with my still limited\r\nRussian vocabulary, to procure another hay-rick to drive me the fourteen\r\nversts remaining between me and the Lettish front. Out of the crowd of\r\nvillagers that surrounded me there emerged a Lettish boy of perhaps\r\nfifteen years, who told me in German that he would take me across. When\r\nthe villagers understood what I wanted, the peasant women insisted that\r\nI must have food before starting. I was taken into one of the dingy\r\nlittle homes, where I was served with good rye bread, butter, milk, and\r\neggs, which I ate greedily, I am afraid, for I was very hungry. Not even\r\nthe thousands of flies that I had to brush away before I could take a\r\nbite prevented my enjoyment of this food.\r\n\r\nAt seven in the evening my boy rescuer and I reached the Lettish front,\r\nthis time in a hay-rick _de luxe_, with straw and an old quilt on the\r\nslats of the floor. The Lettish officers examined me again, and told me\r\nthat if I would take a hay-rick and drive twenty-two versts to the\r\nKreisberg station I could take a train at two in the morning that would\r\nbring me to Riga early the next afternoon. They gave me food, produced a\r\nhay-rick, and, half frozen but safe, I reached Kreizberg and finally\r\nRiga, at one the next afternoon.\r\n\r\nFeeling secure at last, I left the station at Riga and proceeded up the\r\nstreet towards the De Rome Hotel. I noticed an aeroplane circling\r\noverhead, but I had grown so accustomed to war manœuvers that I\r\ndisregarded it entirely. About two squares further on my way I heard a\r\nterrific crash and explosion and turned to see smoke rising from the\r\nstation I had just left. A German aeroplane had bombed the station,\r\nkilling seven people and injuring fourteen.\r\n\r\nArrived at the hotel, I asked the proprietor what was wrong. He told me\r\nthat the Germans were marching on the town, and shelling it as they\r\nmarched, and that 60,000 of them were just across the river.\r\n\r\nMy only thought was that I wanted to get out at once. “You can’t go,” he\r\nsaid. “There are no boats running and the German army[C] controls the\r\nrailroad to Mitau.”\r\n\r\nApparently it was as dangerous to come out to civilization as it had\r\nbeen to go into “barbarous” Soviet Russia. I recalled the peace and the\r\nkindness I had found inside that supposedly violent land with a great\r\nlonging.\r\n\r\nThat afternoon I went to the Lettish Foreign Office to visit the\r\nofficials who had granted me permission to enter a few weeks before.\r\nThey appeared glad to see me, but incredulous as to my identity. Was I\r\nsure that I had been safely through Russia? Was I still in the flesh or\r\nmerely a very vigorous and somewhat pugnacious ghost? My young friend\r\nwho had been so concerned was very eager to know what I had seen. I told\r\nhim I could indeed confirm his worst fears. The Bolsheviki were people\r\nwho had but little respect for the sacred rights of private property. I\r\nhastened to make my escape before he could ask me about the\r\nnationalization of women. I did not want to disappoint him too much.\r\n\r\nThe next day all the guests of the hotel were locked in and forbidden to\r\nleave the hotel. The Lettish staff officers were established in the\r\nhotel, two doors away from my room. Two regiments of Esthonians reached\r\nRiga that day and their first act was to place a big field-gun\r\nimmediately in front of the hotel and begin firing over the roof of it\r\ninto the German position. Knowing the reputation of the Germans for\r\nfinding gun positions, I was not very sanguine over the prospects of my\r\nsafe return to America. The shelling lasted for forty-eight hours,\r\nduring which time the deafening noise and the jarring of the walls made\r\nrest impossible.\r\n\r\nThe Danish Consul and his staff occupied the rooms immediately across\r\nthe hall from mine. The third day they invited me over to lunch with\r\nthem in their room, as Lettish soldiers had been billeted in the\r\ndining-room downstairs. About four in the afternoon, after the wine had\r\nall been consumed, the Danes began singing the songs of their own\r\ncountry. Scarcely an hour later the door of the room was opened and five\r\nLettish officers marched in, ordering us all to “Get your clothes\r\ntogether and get ready.” The Danish Consul asked what they meant. “You\r\nhave been drinking the health of Germany and singing German songs. Yon\r\nare under arrest,” was the answer.\r\n\r\nI was somewhat disappointed when they apologized after we had shown them\r\nour papers. Arrest and deportation to other shores seemed very\r\nattractive to me just then.\r\n\r\nA little later the proprietor came in and told us that food was getting\r\nscarce, that prices had doubled, and that we would have to pay in\r\nCzarist rubles, since the Lettish rubles (which he had been glad to take\r\nbefore) were no longer any good. After we had organized a vigorous\r\nprotest he recanted and we had no further difficulty on that score.\r\n\r\nThe next day Michael Farbman of the _Chicago Tribune_, with G. G.\r\nDesmond of the _London Daily News_, dropped in from somewhere and told\r\nme there would be a chance that Sunday night of going to Copenhagen on a\r\nBritish destroyer. Since Desmond was a British subject we chose him to\r\ntake up the matter with the British mission. His efforts were\r\nsuccessful, and we left the hotel under cover of darkness and, hugging\r\nthe walls of the buildings, we finally reached the British mission. In\r\ncompany with several English officers we started through the dark\r\nstreets at seven-thirty in the evening with shells falling everywhere,\r\nand walked three miles to the bend of the Dvina, out of range of the\r\nfiring. Twice we were shot at by Lettish outposts who had not been\r\ninformed that we were supposed to pass. Luckily for us they proved to be\r\nbad shots, and the shouts of “English, English” from the officers\r\nstopped the firing. At nine in the evening we reached the river and were\r\nbundled into two small boats, pulled by a slow-going gasoline launch.\r\nThe Letts were on one side of the river; the Germans on the other, and\r\nboth sides impartially fired at us with their rifles, but although they\r\nhit each boat once they did not touch us. I shall never forget the\r\nEnglish officers, crouching in the bottoms of the boats—beside\r\nme—shouting “English, English” at the top of their voices as we\r\nproceeded, and persisting in their shouting of the word that had\r\nhitherto proven a magic one, in spite of the fact that it could not\r\npossibly be heard by either side, and forgetting, apparently, that if it\r\nwere heard by the Germans it might not deter them.\r\n\r\nAfter two and one-half hours of this, during which we traversed eight\r\nmiles, we reached the gulf and the comparative safety of the British\r\ncruiser _Abdiel_. At last my troubles were over.\r\n\r\nWe were to leave for Copenhagen the next morning. However, at ten the\r\nnext morning we were transferred from the _Abdiel_ to the _Princess\r\nMargaret_, a Canadian Royal steamer which had been converted into a\r\nmine-layer during the war, and had come into the harbor the night\r\nbefore, on her way to Riga with a cargo of goods. She could not proceed\r\nup the river because of the firing. English officers and all were\r\ntransferred to this ship, because the _Abdiel_ was not leaving and there\r\nwas no telling when the _Princess Margaret_ would leave. For three days\r\nwe were kept on this boat. During this time more than a hundred refugees\r\nfrom Riga were added to its list. Eight or nine British cruisers and\r\ndestroyers were lying at anchor in the Gulf, and on our second morning\r\non the _Princess Margaret_ we learned that the English had given the\r\nGermans until that time to evacuate their positions, after which they\r\nwould open fire. The Germans had refused, and the bombarding began. The\r\n_Princess Margaret_ stood out of range, but we could see with glasses\r\nthe effects of the bombardment, which lasted the whole afternoon, until\r\nfinally the German guns were silenced and the Letts crossed the river.\r\n\r\nThat evening we heard that the destroyer _Cleopatra_ was sailing the\r\nnext morning for Copenhagen and England and would come alongside to take\r\nmail, and that the English officers on the _Princess Margaret_ were\r\ngoing on the _Cleopatra_. Farbman and I sent Desmond to the captain to\r\nget permission for us to go also, which he obtained after some\r\npersuasion. The others remained—and may be there still.\r\n\r\nAt eight the next morning the _Cleopatra_ came toward us, but the sea\r\nwas running high and she could not approach nearer than a hundred yards.\r\nA lifeboat was lowered from the _Princess_, our baggage thrown in, and\r\nwe descended on rope ladders to the swaying and tossing boat below. I am\r\na poor swimmer and the brief but exciting journey to the _Cleopatra_ was\r\noccupied in meditation on my escape from shot and shell only to be\r\ndrowned in the waters of the Gulf.\r\n\r\nWhen we finally reached the _Cleopatra_, I was prepared for more delay,\r\nany amount of delay. I had grown so accustomed to it that I thought it\r\nwould save my nerves from further strain to take it for granted. However\r\nwe started almost immediately. This was Friday morning, October 17th. We\r\nreached Copenhagen Saturday, October 18th, at six in the evening. At\r\nlast I had escaped the roar of cannon and the sound of bursting shells.\r\nThe relief and the peace of Copenhagen could only be compared with the\r\npeace I had found in “Barbarous Soviet Russia.”\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nFootnote C:\r\n\r\n  This was the Army of Von der Glotz.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                                APPENDIX\r\n\r\n                   SOVIET RUSSIA’S CODE OF LABOR LAWS\r\n\r\nI. The Code of Labor Laws shall take effect immediately upon its\r\npublication in the _Compilation of Laws and Regulations of the Workmen’s\r\nand Peasants’ Government_. This Code must be extensively circulated\r\namong the working class of the country by all the local organs of the\r\nSoviet Government and be posted in a conspicuous place in all Soviet\r\nInstitutions.\r\n\r\nII. The regulations of the Code of Labor Laws shall apply to all persons\r\nreceiving remuneration for their work and shall be obligatory for all\r\nenterprises, institutions and establishments (Soviet, public, private\r\nand domestic), as well as for all private employers exploiting labor.\r\n\r\nIII. All existing regulations and those to be issued on questions of\r\nlabor, of a general character (orders of individual establishments,\r\ninstructions, rules of internal management, etc.), as well as individual\r\ncontracts and agreements, shall be valid only in so far as they do not\r\nconflict with this Code.\r\n\r\nIV. All labor agreements previously entered into, as well as all those\r\nwhich will be entered into in the future, in so far as they contradict\r\nthe regulations of this Code, shall not be considered valid or\r\nobligatory, either for the employees or the employers.\r\n\r\nV. In enterprises and establishments where the work is carried on in the\r\nform of organized cooperation (Section 6, Labor Division A of the\r\npresent Code) the wage earners must be allowed the widest possible\r\nself-government under the supervision of the Central Soviet authorities.\r\nOn this basis alone can the working masses be successfully educated in\r\nthe spirit of socialist and communal government.\r\n\r\nVI. The labor conditions in the communal enterprises organized as well\r\nas supported by the Soviet institutions (agricultural and other\r\ncommunes) are regulated by special rules of the All-Russian Central\r\nExecutive Committee and of the Council of People’s Commissars, and by\r\ninstructions of the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture and Labor.\r\n\r\nThe labor conditions of farmers on land assigned them for cultivation\r\nare regulated by the Code of Rural Laws.\r\n\r\nThe labor conditions of independent artisans are regulated by special\r\nrules of the Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE I\r\n                          ON COMPULSORY LABOR\r\n\r\n1.

All students shall be subject to compulsory labor at the schools.\r\n\r\n5. The fact of permanent or temporary disability shall be certified\r\nafter a medical examination by the Bureau of Medical Survey in the city,\r\ndistrict or province, by accident insurance office or agencies\r\nrepresenting the former, according to the place of residence of the\r\nperson whose disability is to be certified.\r\n\r\n_Note I._ The rules on the method of examination of disabled workmen are\r\nappended hereto.\r\n\r\n_Note II._ Persons who are subject to compulsory labor and are not\r\nengaged in useful public work may be summoned by the local Soviets for\r\nthe execution of public work, on conditions determined by the Department\r\nof Labor in agreement with the local Soviets of trade unions.\r\n\r\n6. Labor may be performed in the form of—\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Organized cooperation;\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Individual personal services;\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Individual special jobs.\r\n\r\n7. Labor conditions in government (Soviet) establishments shall be\r\nregulated by tariff rules approved by the Central Soviet authorities\r\nthrough the People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n8. Labor conditions in all establishments (Soviet, nationalized, public\r\nand private) shall be regulated by tariff rules drafted by the trade\r\nunions, in agreement with the directors or owners of establishments and\r\nenterprises, and approved by the People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n_Note._ In cases where it is impossible to arrive at an understanding\r\nwith the directors or owners of establishments or enterprises, the\r\ntariff rules shall be drawn up by the trade unions and submitted for\r\napproval to the People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n9. Labor in the form of individual personal service or in the form of\r\nindividual special jobs shall be regulated by tariff rules drafted by\r\nthe respective trade unions and approved by the People’s Commissariat of\r\nLabor.\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE II\r\n                           THE RIGHT TO WORK\r\n\r\n10. All citizens able to work have the right to employment at their\r\nvocations and for remuneration fixed for such class of work.\r\n\r\n_Note._ The District Exchange Bureaus of the Department of Labor\r\nDistribution may, by agreement with the respective unions, assign\r\nindividual wage earners or groups of them to work at other trades if\r\nthere is no demand for labor at the vocations of the persons in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n11. The right to work belongs first of all to those who are subject to\r\ncompulsory labor.\r\n\r\n12. Of the classes exempt from compulsory labor, only those mentioned in\r\nsubdivision “_b_” of Section 2 have a right to work.\r\n\r\n13. Those mentioned in subdivisions “_a_” and “_c_” of Section 2 are\r\nabsolutely deprived of the right to work, and those mentioned in Section\r\n3 temporarily deprived of the right to work.\r\n\r\n14. All persons of the female sex, and those of the male sex under 18\r\nyears of age, shall have no right to work during night time or in those\r\nbranches of industry where the conditions of labor are especially hard\r\nor dangerous.\r\n\r\n_Note._ A list of especially hard and health-endangering occupations\r\nshall be prepared by the Department of Labor Protection of the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Labor, and shall be published in the month of January of\r\neach year in the _Compilation of Laws and Regulations of the Workmen’s\r\nand Peasants’ Government_.\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE III\r\n                     METHODS OF LABOR DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n15. The enforcement of the right to work shall be secured through the\r\nDepartments of Labor Distribution, trade unions, and through all the\r\ninstitutions of the Russian Socialist Federated Soviet Republic.\r\n\r\n16. The assignment of wage earners to work shall be carried out through\r\nthe Departments of Labor Distribution.\r\n\r\n17. A wage earner may be summoned to work, save by the Departments of\r\nLabor Distribution, only when chosen for a position by a Soviet\r\ninstitution or enterprise.\r\n\r\n18. Vacancies may be filled by election when the work offered requires\r\npolitical reliability or unusual special knowledge, for which the person\r\nelected is noted.\r\n\r\n19. Persons engaged for work by election must register in the Department\r\nof Labor Distribution before they are accepted, but they shall not be\r\nsubject to the rules concerning probation set forth in Article IV of the\r\npresent Code.\r\n\r\n20. Unemployed persons shall be assigned to work through the Departments\r\nof Labor Distribution in the manner stated in Sections 21–30.\r\n\r\n21. A wage earner who is not engaged on work at his vocation shall\r\nregister in the local Department of Labor Distribution as unemployed.\r\n\r\n22. Establishments and individuals in need of workers should apply to\r\nthe Local Department of Labor Distribution or its division\r\n(Correspondence Bureau) stating the condition of the work offered as\r\nwell as the requirements which the workmen must meet (trade, knowledge,\r\nexperience).\r\n\r\n23. The Department of Labor Distribution, on receipt of the application\r\nmentioned in Section 22, shall assign the persons meeting the\r\nrequirements thereof in the order determined by the same.\r\n\r\n24. An unemployed person has no right to refuse an offer of work at his\r\nvocation, provided the working conditions conform with the standards\r\nfixed by the respective tariff regulations, or in the absence of the\r\nsame by the trade unions.\r\n\r\n25. A wage worker engaged for work for a period of not more than two\r\nweeks, shall be considered unemployed, and shall not lose his place on\r\nthe list of the Department of Labor Distribution.\r\n\r\n26. Should the Local Department of Labor Distribution have no workers on\r\nits lists meeting the stated requirements, the application must be\r\nimmediately sent to the District Exchange Bureau, and the establishment\r\nor individual offering the employment shall be simultaneously notified\r\nto this effect.\r\n\r\n27. Whenever workers are required for work outside of their district, a\r\nroll-call of the unemployed registered in the Department of Labor\r\nDistribution shall take place, to ascertain who are willing to go; if a\r\nsufficient number of such should not be found, the Department of Labor\r\nDistribution shall assign the lacking number from among the unemployed\r\nin the order of their registration, provided that those who have\r\ndependents must not be given preference, before single persons.\r\n\r\n28. If in the Departments of Labor Distribution, within the limits of\r\nthe district, there be no workmen meeting the requirements, the District\r\nExchange Bureau has the right, upon agreement with the respective trade\r\nunion, to send unemployed of another class approaching as nearly as\r\npossible the trade required.\r\n\r\n29. An unemployed person who is offered work outside his vocation shall\r\nbe obliged to accept it, on the understanding, if he so wishes, that\r\nthis be only temporary, until he receives work at his vocation.\r\n\r\n30. A wage earner who is working outside his specialty, and who has\r\nstated his wish that this be only temporary, shall retain his place on\r\nthe register on the Department of Labor Distribution until he gets work\r\nat his vocation.\r\n\r\n31. Private individuals violating the rules of labor distribution set\r\nforth in this article shall be punished by the order of the local board\r\nof the Department of Labor Distribution by a fine of not less than 300\r\nrubles or by arrest for not less than one week. Soviet establishments\r\nand officials violating these rules on labor distribution shall be\r\nliable to criminal prosecution.\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE IV\r\n                           PROBATION PERIODS\r\n\r\n32. Final acceptance of workers for permanent employment shall be\r\npreceded by a period of probation of not more than six days; in Soviet\r\ninstitutions the probation period shall be two weeks for unskilled and\r\nless responsible work and one month for skilled and responsible work.\r\n\r\n33. According to the results of the probation the wage earner shall\r\neither be given a permanent appointment, or rejected with payment for\r\nthe period of probation in accordance with the tariff rates.\r\n\r\n34. The results of the probation (acceptance or rejection) shall be\r\ncommunicated to the Department of Labor Distribution.\r\n\r\n35. Up to the expiration of the probation period, the wage earner shall\r\nbe considered as unemployed, and shall retain his place on the eligible\r\nlist of the Department of Labor Distribution.\r\n\r\n36. A person who, after probation, has been rejected, may appeal against\r\nthis decision to the union of which he is a member.\r\n\r\n37. Should the trade union consider the appeal mentioned in the\r\npreceding section justified, it shall enter into negotiations with the\r\nestablishment or person who has rejected the wage earner, with the\r\nrequest to accept the complainant.\r\n\r\n38. In ease of failure of negotiations mentioned in Section 37, the\r\nmatter shall be submitted to the Local Department of Labor, whose\r\ndecision shall be final and subject to no further appeal.\r\n\r\n39. The Department of Labor may demand that the person or establishment\r\nprovide with work the wage earner who has been rejected without\r\nsufficient reason. Furthermore, it may demand that the said person or\r\nestablishment compensate the wage earner according to the tariff rates\r\nfor the time lost between his rejection and his acceptance pursuant to\r\nthe decision of the Department of Labor.\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE V\r\n                 TRANSFER AND DISCHARGE OF WAGE EARNERS\r\n\r\n40. The transfer of wage earners in all enterprises, establishments, or\r\ninstitutions employing paid labor, can take place only if it is required\r\nin the interest of the business and by the decision of the proper organ\r\nof management.\r\n\r\n_Note._ This rule does not apply to work with private individuals\r\nemploying paid labor, if the work is of the subdivisions mentioned in\r\n“_b_” and “_c_” of Section 6.\r\n\r\n41. The transfer of a wage earner to other work within the enterprise,\r\nestablishment or institution where he is employed may be ordered by the\r\nmanaging organs of said enterprise, establishment or institution.\r\n\r\n42. The transfer of a wage earner to another enterprise, establishment\r\nor institution situated in the same or in another locality, may be\r\nordered by the corresponding organ of management with the consent of the\r\nDepartment of Labor Distribution.\r\n\r\n43. The order of an organ of management to transfer a wage earner as\r\nmentioned in Section 40 may be appealed from to the respective\r\nDepartment of Labor (local or district) by the interested individuals or\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\n44. The decision of the Department of Labor in the matter of the\r\ntransfer of a wage earner may be appealed from by the interested parties\r\nto the District Department of Labor or to the People’s Commissariat of\r\nLabor, whose decision in the matter in dispute is final and not subject\r\nto further appeal.\r\n\r\n45. In case of urgent public work the District Department of Labor may,\r\nin agreement with the respective professional unions and with the\r\napproval of the People’s Commissariat of Labor, order the transfer of a\r\nwhole group of wage earners from the organization where they are\r\nemployed to another situated in the same or in another locality,\r\nprovided a sufficient number of volunteers for such work cannot be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n46. The discharge of wage earners from an enterprise, establishment or\r\ninstitution where they have been employed is permissible in the\r\nfollowing cases:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) In case of complete or partial liquidation of the enterprise,\r\n     establishment or institution, or of cancellation of certain orders\r\n     or work;\r\n\r\n     (_b_) In case of suspension of work for more than a month;\r\n\r\n     (_c_) In case of expiration of term of employment or of completion\r\n     of the job, if the work was of a temporary character;\r\n\r\n     (_d_) In case of evident unfitness for work, by special decision of\r\n     the organs of management and subject to agreement with the\r\n     respective professional unions.\r\n\r\n     (_e_) By request of the wage earner.\r\n\r\n47. The organ of management of the enterprise, establishment or\r\ninstitution where a wage earner is employed, or the person for whom a\r\nwage earner is working must give the wage earner two weeks’ notice of\r\nthe proposed discharge, for the reasons mentioned in “_a_,” “_b_” and\r\n“_d_” of Section 46, notifying simultaneously the Local Department of\r\nLabor Distribution.\r\n\r\n48. A wage earner discharged for the reasons mentioned in subdivisions\r\n“_a_,” “_b_” and “_d_” of Section 46 shall be considered unemployed and\r\nentered as such on the lists of the Department of Labor Distribution and\r\nshall continue to perform his work until the expiration of the term of\r\ntwo weeks mentioned in the preceding section.\r\n\r\n49. The order to discharge an employee for the reasons mentioned in\r\nsubdivisions “_a_,” “_b_” and “_d_” of Section 46 may be appealed from\r\nby the interested persons to the Local Department of Labor.\r\n\r\n50. The decision of the Local Department of Labor on the question of\r\ndischarge may be appealed from by either party to the District\r\nDepartment of Labor, whose decision on the question in dispute is final\r\nand not subject to further appeal.\r\n\r\n51. Discharge by request of the wage earner from enterprise,\r\nestablishment or institution must be preceded by an examination of the\r\nreasons for the resignation by the respective organ of workmen’s\r\nself-government (works and other committees).\r\n\r\n_Note._ This rule does not apply to the resignation of a wage earner\r\nemployed by an individual, if the work is of the character mentioned in\r\nsubdivisions “_b_” and “_c_” of Section 6.\r\n\r\n52. If the organ of workers’ self-government (works or other committee)\r\nafter investigating the reasons for the resignation finds the\r\nresignation unjustified the wage earner must remain at work, but may\r\nappeal from the decision of the Committee to the respective professional\r\nunion.\r\n\r\n53. A wage earner who quits work contrary to the decision of the\r\nCommittee, pursuant to Section 52, shall forfeit for one week the right\r\nto register with the Department of Labor Distribution.\r\n\r\n54. Institutions and persons employing paid labor shall inform the Local\r\nDepartment of Labor Distribution and the respective professional union\r\nof each wage earner who quits work, stating the date and the reason\r\nthereof.\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE VI\r\n                         REMUNERATION OF LABOR\r\n\r\n55. The remuneration of wage earners for work in enterprises,\r\nestablishments and institutions employing paid labor, and the detailed\r\nconditions and order of payment shall be fixed by tariffs worked out for\r\neach kind of labor in the manner described in Sections 7–9 of the\r\npresent Code.\r\n\r\n56. All institutions working out the tariff rates must comply with the\r\nprovisions of this article of the Code of Labor Laws.\r\n\r\n57. In working out the tariff rates and determining the standard\r\nremuneration rates, all the wage earners of a trade shall be divided\r\ninto groups and categories and a definite standard of remuneration shall\r\nbe fixed for each of them.\r\n\r\n58. The standard of remuneration fixed by the tariff rates must be at\r\nleast sufficient to cover the minimum living expenses as determined by\r\nthe People’s Commissariat of Labor for each district of the Russian\r\nSocialist Federated Soviet Republic and published in the _Compilation of\r\nLaws and Regulations of the Workmen’s and Peasants’ Government_.\r\n\r\n59. In determining the standard of remuneration for each group and\r\ncategory attention shall be given to the kind of labor, the danger of\r\nthe conditions, under which the work is performed, the complexity and\r\naccuracy of the work, the degree of independence and responsibility as\r\nwell as the standard of education and experience required for the\r\nperformance of the work.\r\n\r\n60. The remuneration of each wage earner shall be determined by his\r\nclassification in a definite group and category.\r\n\r\n61. The classification of wage earners into groups and categories within\r\neach branch of labor shall be done by special valuation commissions,\r\nlocal and central, established by the respective professional\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\n_Note._ The procedure of the valuation commissions shall be determined\r\nby the People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n62. The tariff regulations shall fix the standard of remuneration for a\r\nnormal working day or for piece-work, and particularly the remuneration\r\nfor overtime work.\r\n\r\n63. Remuneration for piece-work shall be computed by dividing the daily\r\ntariff rate by the number of pieces constituting the production\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n64. The standard of remuneration fixed for overtime work shall not\r\nexceed time and a half of the normal remuneration.\r\n\r\n65. Excepting the remuneration paid for overtime work done in the same\r\nor in a different branch of labor, no additional remuneration in excess\r\nof the standard fixed for a given group and category shall be permitted,\r\nirrespective of the pretext and form under which it might be offered and\r\nwhether it be paid in only one or in several places of employment.\r\n\r\n66. Persons working in several places must state in which place of\r\nemployment they wish to receive their pay.\r\n\r\n67. Persons receiving excessive remuneration, in violation of Section\r\n65, shall be liable to criminal prosecution for fraud, and the\r\nremuneration received in excess of the normal (standard) may be deducted\r\nfrom subsequent payments.\r\n\r\n68. From the remuneration of the wage earner may be deducted the excess\r\nremuneration received in violation of Section 65, and the remuneration\r\nearned by the wage earner during his vacation; deduction may also be\r\nmade for cessation of work.\r\n\r\n69. No other deductions, except those mentioned in Section 68, shall be\r\npermitted, irrespective of the form or pretext under which they might be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n70. Payment of remuneration must not be made in advance.\r\n\r\n71. If the work is steady, payment for the same must be made\r\nperiodically, at least once in every fortnight. Remuneration for\r\ntemporary work and for special jobs provided the same continues at least\r\nfor two weeks, shall be paid immediately upon completion of work.\r\n\r\n72. Payments shall be made in money or in kind (lodgings, food supplies,\r\netc.)\r\n\r\n73. To make payments in kind special permission must be obtained from\r\nthe Local Department of Labor which shall determine the rates jointly\r\nwith the respective trade unions.\r\n\r\n_Note._ The rates thus determined must be based on the standard prices\r\nfixed by the respective institutions of the Soviet authority (valuation\r\ncommissions of the Commissariat of Victuals, Land and Housing\r\nDepartment, Price Committee, etc.)\r\n\r\n74. Payments must take place during working hours.\r\n\r\n75. Payments must be made at the place of work.\r\n\r\n76. The wage earner shall be paid only for actual work done. If a\r\ncessation of work is caused during the working day by circumstances\r\nbeyond the control of the wage earner (through accident or through the\r\nfault of the administration), he shall be paid for the time lost on the\r\nbasis of the daily tariff rates, if he does time work, or on the basis\r\nof his average daily earning, if he does piece-work.\r\n\r\n77. A wage earner shall be paid his wage during leave of absence\r\n(Sections 106–107).\r\n\r\n78. During illness of a wage earner the remuneration due him shall be\r\npaid as a subsidy from the hospital funds.\r\n\r\n_Note._ The manner of payment of the subsidy is fixed by rules appended\r\nhereto.\r\n\r\n79. Unemployed shall receive a subsidy out of the funds for unemployed.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Rules concerning unemployed and the payment of subsidies to them\r\nare appended hereto.\r\n\r\n80. Every wage earner must have a labor booklet in which all matters\r\npertaining to the work done by him as well as the payments and subsidies\r\nreceived by him are entered.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Rules regarding labor booklets for wage earners are appended\r\nhereto.\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE VII\r\n                             WORKING HOURS\r\n\r\n81. Working hours are regulated by the tariff rules made for each kind\r\nof labor, in the manner described in Sections 7–9 of the present Code.\r\n\r\n82. The rules for working hours must conform with the provisions of this\r\narticle of the Code of Labor Laws.\r\n\r\n83. A normal working day shall mean the time fixed by the tariff\r\nregulations for the production of a certain amount of work.\r\n\r\n84. The duration of a normal working day must in no case exceed eight\r\nhours for day work and seven hours for night work.\r\n\r\n85. The duration of a normal day must not exceed six hours: (_a_) for\r\npersons under 18 years of age, and (_b_) in especially hard or\r\nhealth-endangering branches of industry (note Section 14 of the present\r\nCode).\r\n\r\n86. During the normal working day time must be allowed for meals and for\r\nrest.\r\n\r\n87. During recess machines, beltings and lathes must be stopped, unless\r\nthis be impossible owing to technical conditions or in cases where these\r\nmachines, beltings, etc., serve for ventilation, drainage, lighting,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n88. The time of recess fixed by Section 86 is not included in the\r\nworking hours.\r\n\r\n89. The recess must take place not later than four hours after the\r\nbeginning of the working day, and must continue not less than a half\r\nhour and not more than two hours.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Additional intermissions every three hours, and for not less\r\nthan a half hour, must be allowed for working women nursing children.\r\n\r\n90. The wage earners may use their free time at their own discretion.\r\nThey shall be allowed during recess to leave the place of work.\r\n\r\n91. In case the nature of the work is such that it requires a working\r\nday in excess of the normal, two or more shifts shall be engaged.\r\n\r\n92. Where there are several shifts, each shift shall work the normal\r\nworking hours; the change of shifts must take place during the time\r\nfixed by the rules of the internal management without interfering with\r\nthe normal course of work.\r\n\r\n93. As a general rule, work in excess of the normal hours (overtime\r\nwork) shall not be permitted.\r\n\r\n94. Overtime work may be permitted in the following exceptional cases:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Where the work is necessary for the prevention of a public\r\n     calamity or in case the existence of the Soviet Government of the\r\n     R. S. F. S. R. or human life is endangered;\r\n\r\n     (_b_) An emergency, public work in relation to water supply,\r\n     lighting, sewerage or transportation, in case of accident or\r\n     extraordinary interruption of their regular operation;\r\n\r\n     (_c_) When it is necessary to complete work which, owing to\r\n     unforeseen or accidental delay due to technical condition of\r\n     production, could not be completed during the normal working hours.\r\n     If leaving the work uncompleted would cause damage to materials or\r\n     machinery;\r\n\r\n     (_d_) On repairs or renewal of machine parts or construction work,\r\n     wherever necessary to prevent stoppage of work by a considerable\r\n     number of wage earners.\r\n\r\n95. In the case described in subdivision “_c_” of Section 94, overtime\r\nwork is permissible only with the consent of the respective trade union.\r\n\r\n96. For overtime work described in subdivision “_d_” of Section 94,\r\npermission must be obtained from the local labor inspector, in addition\r\nto the permit mentioned in the preceding section.\r\n\r\n97. No females and no males under 18 years of age may do any overtime\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n98. The time spent on overtime work in the course of two consecutive\r\ndays must not exceed four hours.\r\n\r\n99. No overtime work shall be permitted to make up for a wage earner’s\r\ntardiness in reporting at his place of work.\r\n\r\n100. All overtime work done by a wage earner, as well as the\r\nremuneration received by him for the same, must be recorded in his labor\r\nbooklet.\r\n\r\n101. The total number of days on which overtime may be permitted in any\r\nenterprise, establishment or institution must not exceed 50 days per\r\nannum, including such days when only one wage earner worked overtime.\r\n\r\n102. Every enterprise, establishment or institution must keep a special\r\nrecord book for overtime work.\r\n\r\n103. All wage earners must be allowed a weekly uninterrupted rest of not\r\nless than 42 hours.\r\n\r\n104. No work shall be done on specially designated holidays.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Rules concerning holidays and days of weekly rest are appended\r\nhereto.\r\n\r\n105. On the eve of rest days the normal working day shall be reduced by\r\ntwo hours.\r\n\r\n_Note._ This section shall not apply to institutions and enterprises\r\nwhere the working day does not exceed six hours.\r\n\r\n106. Every wage earner who has worked without interruption not less than\r\nsix months shall be entitled to leave of absence for two weeks,\r\nirrespective of whether he worked in only one or in several enterprises,\r\nestablishments or institutions.\r\n\r\n107. Every wage earner who has worked without interruption not less than\r\na year shall be entitled to leave of absence for one month, irrespective\r\nof whether he worked in only one or in several enterprises,\r\nestablishments or institutions.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Sections 106 and 107 shall take effect beginning January 1,\r\n1919.\r\n\r\n108. Leave of absence may be granted during the whole year, provided\r\nthat the same does not interfere with the normal course of work in\r\nenterprise, establishment or institution.\r\n\r\n109. The time and order in which leave of absence may be granted shall\r\nbe determined by agreement between the management of enterprise,\r\nestablishment or institution and proper self-government bodies of the\r\nwage earners (works and other committees).\r\n\r\n110. A wage earner shall not be allowed to work for remuneration during\r\nhis leave of absence.\r\n\r\n111. The remuneration of a wage earner earned during his leave of\r\nabsence shall be deducted from his regular wages.\r\n\r\n112. The absence of a wage earner from work caused by special\r\ncircumstances and permitted by the manager shall not be counted as leave\r\nof absence; the wage earner shall not be paid for the working hours lost\r\nin such cases.\r\n\r\n                              ARTICLE VIII\r\n                 METHODS TO ASSURE EFFICIENCY OF LABOR\r\n\r\n113. In order to assure efficiency of labor, every wage earner working\r\nin an enterprise, establishment or institution (governmental, public or\r\nprivate) employing labor in the form of organized collaboration, as well\r\nas the administration of the enterprise, establishment or institution,\r\nshall strictly observe the rules of this article of the Code relative to\r\nstandards of efficiency, output and rules of internal management.\r\n\r\n114. Every wage earner must during a normal working day and under normal\r\nworking conditions perform the standard amount of work fixed for the\r\ncategory and group in which he is enrolled.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Normal conditions referred to in this section, shall mean:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) Good condition of machines, lathes and accessories;\r\n\r\n     (_b_) Timely delivery of materials and tools necessary for the\r\n     performance of the work;\r\n\r\n     (_c_) Good quality of materials and tools;\r\n\r\n     (_d_) Proper hygienic and sanitary equipment of the building where\r\n     the work is performed (necessary lighting, heating, etc.).\r\n\r\n115. The standard output for wage earners of each trade and of each\r\ngroup and category shall be fixed by valuation commissions of the\r\nrespective trade unions (Section 62.)\r\n\r\n116. In determining the standard output the valuation commission shall\r\ntake into consideration the quantity of products usually turned out in\r\nthe course of a normal working day and under normal technical conditions\r\nby the wage earners of the particular trade group and category.\r\n\r\n117. The production standards of output adopted by the valuation\r\ncommission must be approved by the proper Department of Labor jointly\r\nwith the Council of National Economy.\r\n\r\n118. A wage earner systematically producing less than the fixed standard\r\nmay be transferred by decision of the proper valuation commission to\r\nother work in the same group and category, or to a lower group or\r\ncategory, with a corresponding reduction of wages.\r\n\r\n_Note._ The wage earner may appeal from the decision to transfer him to\r\na lower group or category with a reduction of wages, to the Local\r\nDepartment of Labor and from the decision of the latter to the District\r\nDepartment of Labor, whose decision shall be final and not subject to\r\nfurther appeal.\r\n\r\n119. If a wage earner’s failure to maintain the standard output be due\r\nto lack of good faith and to negligence on his part, he may be\r\ndischarged in the manner set forth in subdivision “_d_” of Section 46\r\nwithout the two weeks’ notice prescribed by Section 47.\r\n\r\n120. The Supreme Council of National Economy jointly with the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Labor may direct a general increase or decrease of the\r\nstandards of efficiency and output for all wage earners and for all\r\nenterprises, establishments and institutions of a given district.\r\n\r\n121. In addition to the regulations of the present article relative to\r\nstandards of efficiency and output in enterprises, establishments and\r\ninstitutions, efficiency of labor shall be secured by rules of internal\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n122. The rules of internal management in Soviet institutions shall be\r\nmade by the organs of Soviet authority with the approval of the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Labor or its local departments.\r\n\r\n123. The rules of internal management in industrial enterprises and\r\nestablishments (Soviet, nationalized, private and public) shall be made\r\nby the trade unions and certified by the proper Departments of Labor.\r\n\r\n124. The rules of internal management must include clear, precise and,\r\nas far as possible, exhaustive directions in relation to—\r\n\r\n     (_a_) The general obligations of all wage earners (careful handling\r\n     of all materials and tools, compliance with instructions of the\r\n     managers regarding performance of work, observance of the fixed\r\n     standard of working hours, etc.);\r\n\r\n     (_b_) The special duties of the wage earners of the particular\r\n     branch of industry (careful handling of the fire in enterprises\r\n     using inflammable materials, observance of special cleanliness in\r\n     enterprises producing food products, etc.);\r\n\r\n     (_c_) The limits and manner of liability for breach of the above\r\n     duties mentioned above in subdivisions “_a_” and “_b_.”\r\n\r\n125. The enforcement of the rules of internal management in Soviet\r\ninstitutions is entrusted to the responsible managers.\r\n\r\n126. The enforcement of the rules of internal management in industrial\r\nenterprises and establishments (Soviet, nationalized, public or private)\r\nis entrusted to the self-government bodies of the wage earners (works or\r\nsimilar committees).\r\n\r\n                               ARTICLE IX\r\n                          PROTECTION OF LABOR\r\n\r\n127. The protection of life, health and labor of persons engaged in any\r\neconomic activity is entrusted to the labor inspection—the technical\r\ninspectors and the representatives of sanitary inspection.\r\n\r\n128. The labor inspection is under the jurisdiction of the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Labor and its local branches (Department of Labor) and\r\nis composed of elected labor inspectors.\r\n\r\n129. Labor inspectors shall be elected by the Councils of Professional\r\nUnions.\r\n\r\n_Note I._ The manner of election of labor inspectors shall be determined\r\nby the People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n_Note II._ In districts where there is no Council of Trade Unions, the\r\nLocal Department of Labor shall summon a conference of representatives\r\nof the trade unions which shall elect the labor inspectors.\r\n\r\n130. In performing the duties imposed upon them concerning the\r\nprotection of the lives and health of wage earners the officers of labor\r\ninspection shall enforce the regulations of the present Code, and\r\ndecrees, instructions, orders and other acts of the Soviet power\r\nintended to safeguard the lives and health of the workers.\r\n\r\n131. For the attainment of the purposes stated in Section 130 the\r\nofficers of labor inspection are authorized—\r\n\r\n     (_a_) To visit at any time of the day or night all the industrial\r\n     enterprises of their districts and all places where work is carried\r\n     on, as well as the buildings provided for the workmen by the\r\n     enterprise (rooming houses, hospitals, asylums, baths, etc.);\r\n\r\n     (_b_) To demand of the managers of enterprises or establishments,\r\n     as well as of the elective organs of the wage earners (works and\r\n     similar committees) of those enterprises or establishments in the\r\n     management of which they are participating, to produce all\r\n     necessary books, records and information;\r\n\r\n     (_c_) To draw to the work of inspection representatives of the\r\n     elective organizations of employees, as well as officials of the\r\n     administration (managers, superintendents, foremen, etc.);\r\n\r\n     (_d_) To bring before the criminal court all violators of the\r\n     regulations of the present Code, or of the decrees, instructions,\r\n     orders and other acts of the Soviet authority intended to safeguard\r\n     the lives and health of the wage earners;\r\n\r\n     (_e_) To assist the trade unions and works committees in their\r\n     efforts to ameliorate the labor condition in individual enterprises\r\n     as well as in whole branches of industry.\r\n\r\n132.

The past year was unparalleled in\r\nthe history of the entire international trade union movement, both\r\naccording to the kind of activity as well as those circumstances under\r\nwhich our unions had to carry on their work.\r\n\r\nIt was a year of the dictatorship of the proletariat.\r\n\r\nOn the ruins of the demolished capitalist system, the proletariat of\r\nRussia has taken upon itself the task of building up a new, Socialist\r\nRussia. While struggling and conquering, it was gradually turning to\r\nconstructive work—strengthening its dictatorship by taking possession of\r\nthe entire apparatus of the country’s economic administration.\r\n\r\nThe proletariat, organized into professional unions, constituted the\r\nvanguard of the Socialist revolution. The unions were the hotbeds of\r\nrevolution, and it has fallen to their lot to solve the most complicated\r\nproblems—in fact they took into their hands the management of all\r\neconomic affairs, taking over the factories, the mills and the mines.\r\nThis problem was difficult in itself, and its complexity was increased\r\nstill further through the economic disintegration and chaos which were\r\ncaused by the imperialist world war.\r\n\r\nThe Second All-Russian Conference of Trades Unions demonstrated that the\r\nRussian professional trades union movement has grown stronger during the\r\nyear and that its organization has improved in both quantity and\r\nquality.\r\n\r\nThe qualitative progress made by the Russian trades union movement\r\nexpressed itself in that marvelous intelligence which the Conference\r\ndisplayed in grappling with the complicated problems it had to face. If\r\nthe first All-Russian Conference of Professional trades unions outlined\r\na rough draft of a plan according to which the working class was to\r\nsteer its course during the period of its supremacy, if at that first\r\nconference the delegates were groping in the dark, trying to feel the\r\ncorrect way,—the second Conference found the path sufficiently cleared\r\nto proceed forward toward the solution of new problems put forth by the\r\nlife and practice of the professional movement. If at the First\r\nConference we could only speak of regulating industry and controlling\r\nit, now, at this Second Conference, we can already tabulate the results\r\nof organization in the realm of industry by the efforts of the working\r\nclass itself.\r\n\r\nA big stride forward was made by the proletariat organized within\r\nprofessional trades unions, when in discussing the question of\r\norganization it pointed out clearly and definitely the place which the\r\nproletariat of the entire world is occupying under the present\r\ncircumstances. The Conference has not only firmly and decisively drawn\r\nthe line between its position and that of neutrality, but it took a\r\ndefinite stand in favor of recognizing “the revolutionary class struggle\r\nfor the realization of Socialism through the dictatorship of the\r\nproletariat.”\r\n\r\nThe quantitative growth of the Russian trades unions since the first\r\nConference, notwithstanding the fact that the counter-revolution has\r\nsnatched away a number of provinces (Siberia, Finland, the Donetz\r\nregion, Caucasia, etc.), has resulted in a membership of 3,422,000\r\nwhereas only 2,500,000 members were represented at the First Conference.\r\nThus, within one year the membership increased by almost one million.\r\nAccording to the All-Russian industrial groupings, the number of union\r\nmembers represented at the conference was distributed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Metal trades                                            400,000\r\n\r\n    Tanners                                                 225,000\r\n\r\n    Members of Trade-Industrial Union (probably             200,000\r\n    sales clerks)\r\n\r\n    Workers engaged in the food industry                    140,000\r\n\r\n    Tailors                                                 150,000\r\n\r\n    Chemists                                                 80,000\r\n\r\n    Architectural and building trades                       120,000\r\n\r\n    Wood-working trades                                      70,000\r\n\r\n    Printers                                                 60,000\r\n\r\n    Railroad workers                                        450,000\r\n\r\n    Glass and chinaware workers                              24,000\r\n\r\n    Water transportation workers                            200,000\r\n\r\n    Postal-telegraphic employees                            100,000\r\n\r\n    Sugar industry                                          100,000\r\n\r\n    Textile workers (according to data furnished   by       711,000\r\n    the local union)\r\n\r\n    Firemen                                                  50,000\r\n\r\n    Oil miners and refiners                                  30,000\r\n\r\n    Chauffeurs                                               98,000\r\n\r\n    Bank employees                                           70,000\r\n\r\n    Domestic help                                            50,000\r\n\r\n    Waiters (in taverns)                                     50,000\r\n\r\n    Cigar and cigarette makers                               30,000\r\n\r\n    Drug clerks                                              14,000\r\n\r\n    Foresters                                                 5,000\r\n\r\nAccording to the data furnished by the committee on credentials, there\r\nwere 748 delegates at the Conference with the right to vote, and 131\r\nwith a voice. The political composition of the Conference (according to\r\nthe results of an informal inquiry) was as follows: 374 Communists, 75\r\nsympathizers, 15 Left Socialists-Revolutionists, 5 Anarchists, 18\r\nInternationalists, 4 representatives of the Bund, 29 United\r\nSocial-Democrats, 23 non-partisans, and 236 delegates did not state\r\ntheir party affiliations. The party registration bureaus showed entirely\r\ndifferent results, which have been confirmed by the vote cast for the\r\nmain resolutions. Thus, at the Communist bureau 600 persons have\r\nregistered (this includes party members having the right to vote,\r\nsympathizers, and people with a voice only, but no vote), the\r\nInternationalists had 50 persons, and the United Social-Democrats had\r\n70.\r\n\r\nGeographically the delegates were represented as follows:\r\n\r\n                                     Second             First\r\n\r\n       From Unions                 Conference         Conference\r\n\r\n       The Northern Region    100  delegates      69  delegates\r\n\r\n       The Central Region     320      \"         112      \"\r\n\r\n       The Volga Region       144      \"          25      \"\r\n\r\n       The Ural Region          2      \"          13      \"\r\n\r\n       The Southern Region     31      \"          62      \"\r\n\r\n       The Western Region      30      \"          ..      \"\r\n\r\n\r\n       From Soviets and\r\n       Northern Region         29      \"\r\n\r\n       Central Region          70      \"\r\n\r\n       Ural Region              3      \"\r\n\r\n       Southern Region          6      \"\r\n\r\n       Western Region          14      \"\r\n\r\n       Volga Region            30      \"\r\n\r\nThe local Soviets of the Professional Unions were represented according\r\nto regions, as follows:\r\n\r\n       Central Region        36 cities         1,004,500 persons\r\n\r\n       Northern Region       16 cities           396,000 persons\r\n\r\n       Volga Region          19 cities           499,300 persons\r\n\r\n       Western Region         7 cities            73,800 persons\r\n\r\n       Southern Region        4 cities            64,000 persons\r\n\r\n                                ——————                 —————————\r\n\r\n       Total                 82 cities         2,037,600 persons\r\n\r\n\r\n       At the preceding      49 cities         1,888,353 persons\r\n       Conference\r\n\r\nFrom June 16th to 25th, 1919, during the nine days of its work, the\r\nsecond All-Russian Congress of Trades Unions solved the fundamental\r\nquestions of the Russian professional (trades union) movement. The\r\nConference more precisely defined the place of the professional trades\r\nunions in a proletarian state, it has more concretely outlined the\r\ninterrelations of the trades unions with the organs of administration\r\nand, above all, with the People’s Commissariat of Labor. All other\r\nquestions, such as the regulation of working hours and wages, the\r\nsafeguarding of labor and the social insurance of laborers, the\r\norganization of production, and workmen’s control have been solved on\r\nthe basis of the experience of the past year.\r\n\r\nThe Russian professional unions entered upon a new era of proletarian\r\nactivity. And the unions are already facing practical problems—to put\r\ninto practice the principles and resolutions adopted and in all phases\r\nof its work to follow one direction, that of still further strengthening\r\nits power, and participating more closely in establishing the might of\r\nproletarian Russia.\r\n\r\n             THE PROBLEMS OF THE PROFESSIONAL TRADES UNIONS\r\n\r\n                (_A resolution introduced by M. Tomsky_)\r\n\r\nOne year of political and economic dictatorship of the proletariat and\r\nthe growth of the workers’ revolution the world over, have fully borne\r\nout the correctness of the position taken by the first All-Russian\r\nConference of the Professional Trades Unions, who have unconditionally\r\nbound up the fate of the economically organized proletariat with that of\r\nthe Workers’ and Peasants’ Government.\r\n\r\nThe attempt, under the flag of “unity” and “independence” of the trades\r\nunion movement, to pit the economically organized proletariat against\r\nthe organs of the political dictatorship of its own class, has led the\r\ngroups which were supporting this slogan, to an open struggle against\r\nthe Soviet Government and has placed them outside the ranks of the\r\nworking class.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the practical cooperation with the Soviet Government in\r\nthe work for the strengthening and organization of the nation’s economic\r\nlife, the professional trades unions have passed from control over\r\nindustry to organization of industry, taking an active part in the\r\nmanagement of individual enterprises as well as in the entire economic\r\nlife of the country.\r\n\r\nBut the task of nationalization of all the means of production and the\r\norganization of society on the new principles of Socialism demands\r\npersistent and careful labor involving the reconstruction of the entire\r\ngovernmental apparatus, the creation of new organs of control, and\r\nregulation of production and distribution, based on the organization and\r\nactivity of the laboring masses who are themselves directly interested\r\nin the results.\r\n\r\nThis makes it imperative for the trades unions to take a more active and\r\nenergetic part in the work of the Soviet Government (through direct\r\nparticipation in all governmental institutions, through the organization\r\nof proletarian mass control over their actions, and the carrying out, by\r\nmeans of their organization, of individual problems with which the\r\nSoviet Government is confronted), to aid in the reconstruction of\r\nvarious governmental institutions and in the gradual replacement of the\r\nsame by their own organizations by amalgamating the unions with the\r\ngovernmental institutions.\r\n\r\nHowever, it would be a mistake at the given stage of development of the\r\nprofessional trades union movement with the insufficiently developed\r\norganization to convert immediately the unions into governmental organs\r\nand to amalgamate the two organizations as well as for the unions to\r\nusurp of their own accord the functions of governmental institutions.\r\n\r\nThe entire process of complete amalgamation of the professional unions\r\nwith the organs of government administration must come as an absolutely\r\ninevitable result of their work, in complete and close cooperation and\r\nharmony and the preparation of the laboring masses, for the task of\r\nmanaging the governmental apparatus and all the institutions for the\r\nregulation of the country’s economic life.\r\n\r\nThis, in its turn, places before the unions the problem of welding\r\ntogether the as yet unorganized proletarian and semi-proletarian masses\r\ninto strong productive unions, initiating them, under the control of the\r\nproletarian unions, into the task of social reconstruction and the\r\ngeneral work of strengthening their organizations, as regards\r\ncentralization and smoothly working unions as well as the strengthening\r\nof professional discipline.\r\n\r\nDirectly participating in all fields of Soviet work, forming and\r\nsupplying the man-power for the governmental institutions, the\r\nprofessional unions must, through this work for which they must enlist\r\ntheir own organizations as well as the laboring masses, educate and\r\nprepare them for the task of managing not only production but the entire\r\napparatus of government.\r\n\r\n                PROFESSIONAL UNIONS AND THE COMMISSARIAT\r\n\r\nOF LABOR\r\n\r\n            (_A resolution embodied in V. Schmidt’s report_)\r\n\r\nProfessional trades unions organized according to the scale of\r\nproduction, called upon to regulate the conditions of labor and\r\nproduction in the interests of the working class as a whole, under the\r\nconditions of proletarian dictatorship, are becoming gradually converted\r\ninto economic associations of the proletariat, acquiring a nation-wide\r\nsignificance. On the other hand, the Commissariat of Labor, as an organ\r\nof the Workers’ and Peasants’ Government, in which the organized\r\nindustrial proletariat is at the present moment playing a leading part,\r\nserves as an instrument for the introduction of the economic policy of\r\nthe working class, utilizing for this purpose its apparatus and all the\r\npower vested in governmental authorities to enforce its laws and\r\nregulations.\r\n\r\nTherefore, with a view to eliminating the duality in the united economic\r\npolicy of the working class, it is necessary to recognize that all\r\nfundamental decisions of the supreme union organ—the Congress of\r\nProfessional Unions—are to be adopted by the People’s Commissariat of\r\nLabor and embodied in its proposed legislation and all special\r\nobligatory regulations bearing on the conditions of labor and\r\nproduction, must first be approved by a majority of the All-Russian\r\nCentral Council of Professional Trades Unions.\r\n\r\nThe Conference fully approves of coordination and cooperation between\r\nthe All-Russian Central Council of Trades Unions and the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Labor and suggests that the local councils (Soviets) of\r\ntrades unions participate in the work of local branches (departments) of\r\nthe Commissariat of Labor, on the basis of the relations prevailing\r\nbetween the central bodies, for which purpose the local councils of\r\ntrades unions are to send their representatives into the leading Soviets\r\nand make up out of the union apparatus its subdivisions (tariff, social\r\ninsurance, labor safeguarding, etc.)\r\n\r\nIn order to finally eliminate all duplication in the solution of\r\nquestions concerning the conditions and regulation of labor by separate\r\ndepartments, the Conference suggests that the All-Russian Central\r\nExecutive Committee and the Soviet of People’s Commissaries concentrate\r\nall its efforts to the working out of standards regulating the\r\nconditions of work, wages, organization of labor, order of employing and\r\ndischarging help, safeguarding labor, and social insurance, through the\r\nPeople’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\n    THE PARTICIPATION OF THE UNIONS IN THE ORGANIZATION OF INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n        (_A resolution on the report made by Comrade Rudzutak_)\r\n\r\n1. The process of taking over the control of the industries which is now\r\nbeing completed by the workers’ government, places the vocational\r\nassociations in a position where they are coming to play an ever more\r\nand more important part in the special fields of their activity.\r\n\r\n2. Standing in close relationship to the actual production and thus\r\nbeing the natural guardians of industry against the remnants of the\r\nbureaucratic apparatus permeated by the traditions of the old regime,\r\nthe unions must build a new Socialist order, in accordance with the\r\nfixed program of production based on a national plan for the utilization\r\nof the proper products and material.\r\n\r\n3. In the interests of preserving a single plan of organization of\r\nproduction, management and distribution, it will be necessary to\r\nconcentrate in one center all the units of production, which are now in\r\nthe charge of various departments (Chief Artillery Department, Navy and\r\nWar Departments, etc.)\r\n\r\n4. The participation of the unions in the industrial management should\r\nconsist in the working out of a system of activity for the regulating\r\nand managing organs as a whole, insofar as there is a possibility of\r\nsome part or other of their membership not being permeated by the spirit\r\nof Socialistic constructive activity. The management of the leading\r\ndepartments and centers must be composed mainly of the representatives\r\nof professional unions, following an understanding between the\r\ncorresponding All-Russian Industrial Association or the All-Russian\r\nCouncil of Trades Unions and the presiding officers of the Supreme\r\nCouncil of National Economy.\r\n\r\n5. All delegates representing the trades unions within the\r\nadministrative and regulating bodies are responsible to the\r\ncorresponding unions and are to report on their activities at regular\r\nintervals.\r\n\r\n6. In order to keep up the organic connection between the unions and the\r\nmanagement of the government owned mills, the unions are to call\r\nconferences of the management of the largest enterprises, not less than\r\nonce in two months, for the purpose of discussing and passing upon the\r\nmost important practical questions arising in the process of work.\r\n\r\n7. In order to convert the regulating and managing organs into a\r\nproletarian apparatus for constructive Socialist work and in order to\r\nobtain the cooperation in this work of the large masses of the more\r\nadvanced workers, it is necessary to saturate all the organs of\r\nregulation and management with proletarian elements by means of placing\r\nin their ranks responsible workers who assert themselves within the\r\ncentral and local trade union groups.\r\n\r\n8. Together with the part which the unions are playing in the matter of\r\ndirecting the industrial life along the channels fixed by the programs\r\nof production, based upon the subjugation of private interest to those\r\nof society as a whole, comes their activity in connection with the basic\r\nelement of production—labor. Therefore, the decisions of the central\r\ntrade union associations are obligatory insofar as they bear on the\r\nquestions of wage scales, inspection of labor, internal regulations\r\nwithin the factories, standards of production and labor discipline.\r\n\r\n9. Being placed in the position of organizers of production at a moment\r\nwhen Russia is now more than at any other time, affected by a shortage\r\nof various kinds of material which causes a reduction of the output, the\r\nunions must safeguard the proletariat against the possibility of its\r\nexhaustion or degeneration, as a class of producers, at this critical\r\nperiod, and to safeguard its nucleus against social disintegration and\r\nits absorption by other classes; it is therefore necessary:\r\n\r\n     (_a_) wherever a shortage of raw material exists to reduce the\r\n     working day or the number of days per week, keeping employed at the\r\n     factory the largest possible number of workers.\r\n\r\n     (_b_) to introduce, wherever the number of hours or days per week\r\n     is reduced, obligatory attendance at technical and educational\r\n     courses, so as to utilize the crisis for the purpose of lifting the\r\n     technical and cultural level of the laboring masses.\r\n\r\n10. At the same time, in view of the primary significance of actually\r\nsupplying the mills with the necessary products, and the impossibility\r\nof increasing the productivity of labor and introducing discipline,\r\nunless this question is solved in a satisfactory manner, it is necessary\r\nto enable the trades unions to participate as closely as possible in the\r\nwork of production and distribution of provisions.\r\n\r\n                            WORKERS’ CONTROL\r\n\r\n          (_Resolution in connection with N. Glebov’s report_)\r\n\r\nThe Second All-Russian Congress of Vocational Unions, having heard the\r\nreport on workers’ control, recognizes the following:\r\n\r\n1. Workers’ control, which was the strongest revolutionary weapon in the\r\nhands of the labor organizations in their struggle against economic\r\ndisruption and the sabotage practised by the employers in their struggle\r\nagainst the proletariat for economic supremacy, has led the working\r\nclass into direct participation in the organization of production.\r\n\r\n2. The economic dictatorship of the working class has created new\r\nconditions which stirred up the activity of the large masses of the\r\nworkers. Through their vocational associations the workers have been\r\ncalled upon to organize the country’s economic life and to participate\r\nin the management of production.\r\n\r\n3. At the same time the working class domination over the economic life\r\nof the country has not as yet been completed. A subdued struggle is\r\nstill seething within the new forms of economic life, which calls forth\r\nthe necessity on the part of the laboring masses to control the\r\nactivities of the institutions in charge of the management of\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n4. Under such conditions of transition from the capitalist system to the\r\nSocialist regime, the workers’ control must develop, from a\r\nrevolutionary weapon for the economic dictatorship of the proletariat,\r\ninto a practical institution aiding in the strengthening of this\r\ndictatorship in the process of production.\r\n\r\n5. The problems of workers’ control must be confined to the supervision\r\nof the course of work in the various establishments, and to practically\r\ncheck on the activity of the management of individual mills as well as\r\nthat of entire branches of industry. The workers’ control is carried out\r\nin practice in a certain order according to which control does not\r\nprecede, but, on the contrary, follows the executive work.\r\n\r\n6. Workers’ control is also to solve the problem of the gradual\r\npreparation of the large masses of the working class for direct\r\nparticipation in the matter of management and organization of industry.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view the Congress resolves:\r\n\r\n1. To confirm the decision of the first All-Russian Congress of\r\nVocational Unions regarding the formation of organs of control, both\r\nlocal and central, under the guidance of the vocational associations of\r\nthe working class.\r\n\r\n2. Within every nationalized industrial, commercial, and transport\r\nhouse, the local committee for control takes upon itself the supervision\r\nof the work of the enterprise and the activities of its management, for\r\nwhich purpose it gathers and systematizes all data relative to the\r\nrunning of the establishment and places the same at the disposal of the\r\ncontrol department of their trade union, before which, whenever the\r\nnecessity arises, the question of auditing the books of the enterprise\r\nis brought up.\r\n\r\n     _Note._ In extraordinary cases the local control commission has the\r\n     right on its own responsibility to fix the time for a revision of\r\n     their enterprise, with a precise statement of the subject of\r\n     control, on condition that the local control committee immediately\r\n     notify to that effect the Department of Control of the\r\n     corresponding industrial (vocational) union.\r\n\r\n3. The local control committee is being formed of: (_a_) representatives\r\nof the corresponding industrial (vocational) union; (_b_) of the persons\r\nelected by the general meeting of the workers employed in a given\r\nfactory, who are subject to approval by the committee of the\r\ncorresponding industrial (vocational) union. The members of the local\r\ncontrol committee elected from among the committee of the industrial\r\nunion, retain their office for a considerable length of time; while the\r\npersons elected at the general meeting are to be replaced in as short a\r\nperiod as possible, with a view to training the large masses of the\r\npeople in the work of management and organization of industry so as to\r\ninsure the gradual transition to the system of universal participation\r\nin it of all the workers.\r\n\r\n4. The local control committee is responsible for its activities both\r\nbefore the general meeting of the workers of their factory and before\r\nthe control department of their industrial (vocational) union. In case\r\nof abuse of authority, negligence in carrying out its duties, and so on,\r\nthe local control committee is subject to severe punishment.\r\n\r\n5. The representatives of the local control committee participate at the\r\nsessions of the management of the mill or factory, having only a voice,\r\nbut no vote in the matter. The rights of administration of the\r\nestablishment remains with the management and therefore the entire\r\nresponsibility for the work of the enterprise rests with the management.\r\n\r\n6. The coordination of the workers’ control within the limits of any\r\ngiven industry must be centered within the industrial (vocational)\r\nunion. The union creates a Workers’ Control Department which is\r\nresponsible before the management of its union.\r\n\r\n7. The Congress authorizes the All-Russian Central Council (Soviet) of\r\nVocational Unions to direct the institutions of workers’ control. For\r\nthis purpose the All-Russian Central Council is to form a supreme organ\r\nof workers’ control, composed of the representatives of the industrial\r\n(vocational) unions.\r\n\r\n8. With a view to coordinating all activities and eliminating the\r\nduplication of functions in the work of control, the organs of the\r\nPeople’s Commissariat of State Control must work in contact with the\r\ncontrolling organs of the industrial (vocational) unions.\r\n\r\n9. The supreme organ of workers’ control is to work out the\r\ninstructions, fully determining the rights and duties of the lower\r\norgans of control and their organization. Until such time as these\r\ninstructions are made public the organs of workers’ control in the\r\nnationalized enterprises are to be guided by these rulings.\r\n\r\n10. The regulations for the workers’ control of nationalized enterprises\r\nmust be decreed by the Council of People’s Commissaries.\r\n\r\n11. In the establishments which have not been nationalized workers’\r\ncontrol is to be carried out in accordance with the decree of November\r\n14, 1917.\r\n\r\n                        WAGE AND WORK REGULATION\r\n\r\n    (_Resolution introduced in connection with V. Schmidt’s report_)\r\n\r\nObserving a great variety and lack of coordination of the tariff (wage\r\nscale) regulations which hamper not only the standardization of labor,\r\nbut their practical materialization, and explaining such an abnormal\r\nphenomenon in this matter by the presence of a number of glaring\r\ndefects, (absence of a definite system of wages, which would serve as a\r\nbasis of the tariff regulations, the elasticity of groups and\r\ncategories, the elimination from these regulations of the salaries of\r\nthe higher technical, commercial and administrative personnel), defects\r\ndue to the rapid transition from one form of wage scale regulation to\r\nanother; due to the weakness of the local unions and their local\r\nseparatism, and, finally, the inconsistency (instability) of the local\r\norgans of governments in regard to the wage regulation policy, the\r\nSecond All-Russian Congress of Vocational Unions deems it necessary to\r\nintroduce the following amendments and additions to the wage\r\nregulations:\r\n\r\n1. The basic principle of wage scale regulation, in connection with the\r\nstruggle for the restoration of the country’s economic forces, must be\r\nthe responsibility of the laborers and other employees for the\r\nproductivity of labor before their union, and the responsibility of the\r\nlatter before the class associations of the proletariat. For this\r\npurpose the wage scale regulations must be based on the system of\r\ncompensation of labor power which would serve as an incentive for the\r\nlaborers to outdo each other in their desire to raise the productivity\r\nof labor in the nationalized enterprises, i.e. the piece-work and\r\npremium system founded on a rock-bottom standard of production, with a\r\nfirmly fixed schedule of either increased pay or decreased hours of work\r\nin compensation for production above the standard requirements.\r\n\r\nIn those branches of industry where it is impossible to standardize the\r\nwork, a scale of wages is to be applied on the basis of the time\r\nemployed with definite hours of work and strict working regulations.\r\n\r\n2. The wage scale of the industrial union is to include the higher\r\ntechnical, commercial and administrative personnel, whose salaries are\r\nto be subject to the control of the union. In accordance with this, the\r\ntariff regulation is to be divided into three fundamental parts; (_a_)\r\nthe higher technical, commercial, and administrative personnel; (_b_)\r\nthe lower technical and administrative personnel; the employees of the\r\nmanagements, the offices, institutions and commercial establishments,\r\nand (_c_) the laborers.\r\n\r\n3. In order to eliminate too large a number of groups and categories\r\n(five groups and 15 categories) and to insure a fair compensation of the\r\nbasic nucleus of the workers and other employees occupied in the\r\nindustries, a subdivision into four groups and 12 categories is fixed\r\nfor each of the three ranks (the higher personnel, the lower staff, the\r\nworkers), the ratio of the higher wage to the lower within the limits of\r\neach one of the four given groups, from the first category to the 12th,\r\nis 1:1.75.\r\n\r\n4. The wage scale regulations for individual groups of the workers and\r\nfor certain branches of industry or parts thereof, must contain\r\nprovisions either for the shortening of hours, or for the increase of\r\npay as compensation for particularly harmful, dangerous, difficult or\r\nexhaustive labor, and in connection with climatic conditions.\r\n\r\n5. Clothing and footwear is to be distributed to the workers engaged in\r\nthe wood chopping industry, the sewerage and street cleaning industry,\r\nor occupied in underground work, work at a particularly high\r\ntemperature, or necessitating the handling of harmful chemicals.\r\nParticularly difficult and harmful work (such as, underground work, the\r\npeat gathering industry, the preparation of wood fuel, work at a high\r\ntemperature, work with poisonous gases and acids exhausting the system)\r\nshould carry with it a home and a higher wage. This latter measure is to\r\nbe carried out by the All-Russian and local councils of the Vocational\r\nUnions. In order to put these additions and amendments to the wage scale\r\nregulations into actual life and in order to do away with the obnoxious\r\nmultiformity the Congress resolves:\r\n\r\nTo recognize the wage scale regulation which is being carried out on a\r\nnational scale and which affects all the workers and employees of a\r\ngiven industry, from the highest administrator down to the skilled\r\nlaborer,—as the one which best answers the fundamental needs of\r\nstandardizing the wages.\r\n\r\nTo grant to the All-Russian Central Committee of the Industrial Unions\r\nthe exclusive right to finally work out the wage scale regulations and\r\nto submit them for approval of the All-Russian Central Council of\r\nProfessional Unions and to the People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\nTo deprive the local branches of the All-Russian centralized unions of\r\nthe right to directly submit their wage scale for approval over the head\r\nof their central body, so long as an All-Russian industrial wage scale\r\nis in operation.\r\n\r\nTo leave to the local Soviets (councils) of the Vocational Unions the\r\nright to fix the wage scale regulations only for the local unions, which\r\nhave no All-Russian association, using the wage scale regulations in\r\nforce as a guide; under no circumstances changing the regulations passed\r\non a national scale. Besides, it is the duty of the local Soviets of the\r\nVocational Unions to coordinate individual scales in different\r\nindustries while putting them into practice, and the right to present a\r\ngrounded petition for the transfer of a given locality into another\r\ndistrict in accordance with the proportional (percentage) scale of\r\ndistrict decrease of wages.\r\n\r\nThe Congress approves of the work of the committee and the section on\r\nthe construction of wage scale regulations and recommends to the\r\nAll-Russian centralized industrial unions to accept them as a basis. The\r\nCongress authorizes the All-Russian Central Council of Vocational Unions\r\nto carry out this resolution strictly and without any deviations.\r\n\r\n                 LABOR SAFEGUARDS AND SOCIAL INSURANCE\r\n\r\nOF THE WORKERS\r\n\r\n     (_Resolution passed in connection with A. Bakhutov’s report_)\r\n\r\nIn capitalist society, with the complete economic and political\r\nsupremacy of the bourgeoisie, the legal measures which were enacted for\r\nthe safeguarding of labor and the individual kinds of social insurance\r\nof the workers were being enforced under the control of the capitalist\r\nstate, together with the employing class, and beyond the reach of direct\r\ninfluence of the labor organizations. With the establishment of the\r\ndictatorship of the proletariat it became possible for the first time to\r\nput point blank all the questions arising out of the struggle against\r\nthe grave consequences of the conditions of labor, which remain as a\r\nlegacy of the capitalist era, as well as preventive measures and the\r\nsolutions of the questions, in accordance with the Socialist aims of the\r\npresent moment. The actual safeguarding of labor and the social\r\ninsurance of the worker, with a view to safeguarding his life and\r\nincreasing his strength and power, proved to be indissoluble aspects of\r\nthe same problem—changing of conditions of labor, the reconstruction of\r\nthe industrial environment in which the worker is laboring, and the\r\nbetterment of his living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe October revolution determined the basic principles of social defence\r\nfor the proletariat of Russia, having given over the safeguarding of\r\nlabor and social insurance of the toilers into the hands of the working\r\nclass, and for the first time it has created organs of factory\r\ninspection on the basis of elective representation.\r\n\r\nBut the acute civil war and the economic work of organization, as the\r\nfundamental problem which has been confronting the working class during\r\nthe first year of the October _coup d’état_, have diverted the attention\r\nof the proletariat from a problem of no lesser significance—the\r\nsafeguarding of its health, as the main source of national economy—and\r\nits economic organizations became indifferent. This is the reason why\r\nthe working class paid but very little attention to questions of labor\r\nsafeguards and social insurance, as well as to the institutions in\r\ncharge of these questions.\r\n\r\n                  *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, however, the building of a new life, the\r\nreconstruction of the conditions of labor on a Socialist foundation, the\r\nsafeguarding of production for the life and health of the workers, the\r\nbetterment of their living conditions, the workers’ insurance against\r\nall accidents depriving him of his labor power, the amalgamation of the\r\nvarious kinds of insurance agencies into one powerful organization, and\r\nthe management of the same, are becoming the most important problems\r\nwhich the vocational unions are to solve. Together with the economic\r\nwork of organization which includes the safeguarding of labor, social\r\ninsurance of the toilers must take the proper place in the every-day\r\nwork of the unions.\r\n\r\nTaking all this into consideration, the second Congress of Vocational\r\nUnions finds it necessary that the vocational unions—\r\n\r\n1. Take active part in the construction of united government insurance\r\nbodies through the formation of corresponding subdivisions within the\r\ndepartments of labor of the local Soviets, in accordance with the\r\ninstructions of the Department of Social Insurance and Labor Safeguards\r\nof the People’s Commissariat of Labor; 2. That they energetically carry\r\nout the “regulations of social insurance of the workers” of October\r\n31st, 1918; 3. That they immediately start the organization within the\r\nunions of permanent committees on the safeguarding of labor, and of\r\n_nuclei_ for the same within the various mills and factories for the\r\npurpose of cooperating with the governmental institutions charged with\r\nthe safeguarding of labor; 4. That they intensify the work on the spot\r\nfor the creation of labor inspection by means of selection and training\r\nfor this purpose of the active workers; 5. That they practically spread\r\nthe validity of the safeguarding of labor regulations and their\r\nenforcement over all types of labor (in the building trades, in the\r\ntransport service, over domestic servants, commercial and office\r\nworkers, restaurant help, and agricultural workers); 6. That they pay\r\nparticular attention to the conditions of labor in the small\r\nsemi-handicraft establishments; 7. That they assist in the practical\r\nefforts of labor inspection to remove the children from the works and\r\nfor the introduction of a shorter work-day for minors, enabling them at\r\nthe same time to continue their education; 8. That they take an active\r\npart in the organization of local sanitary-hygienic and technical\r\ninvestigations of the conditions at the factories and mills, and in the\r\nworking out of various obligatory standards and various measures for the\r\nsafeguarding of labor; 9. That they carry out the principles of labor\r\nsafeguarding through the current activity of the local and central\r\norgans regulating the nation’s economy; 10. That they take an active\r\npart in the work of improving the living conditions of the working\r\npopulation; 11. That they energetically push the agitational and\r\neducational work among the proletarian masses along the lines of\r\nvocational hygiene and sanitation and the technique of insuring safety,\r\nas well as on general questions of social insurance and labor\r\nsafeguarding.\r\n\r\n        THE INTERRELATION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL INSURANCE\r\n       AND LABOR SAFEGUARDS OF THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT OF LABOR\r\n           AND THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT OF SOCIAL INSURANCE\r\n\r\nWhereas in the process of development of the social revolution the\r\ndivision of society into a handful of parasites, on the one hand, and\r\ninto the masses of workers and peasants overloaded with excessive toil,\r\non the other, is constantly disappearing, and the entire population is\r\nbeing transformed into a mass of producers who must be insured, in\r\naccordance with the provisions of the regulations on social insurance of\r\nthe laborers, of October 31, 1918, against all accidents that might\r\nincapacitate them, and\r\n\r\nWhereas the work of social insurance can be developed on condition of\r\nimmediate participation of vocational unions through the medium of the\r\ncorresponding organs of the People’s Commissariat of Labor,\r\n\r\nThe second Congress of Vocational Unions holds that all insurance\r\nbusiness, its functions, the institutions of the People’s Commissariat\r\nof Social Insurance, affecting the workers, must be amalgamated into the\r\ncommon work of the Department of Social Insurance and Labor Safeguard of\r\nthe People’s Commissariat of Labor.\r\n\r\nHaving discussed the question of interrelations between the Commissariat\r\nof Public Health and the Department of Social Insurance and Labor\r\nSafeguards of the People’s Commissariat of Labor, the second All-Russian\r\nCongress of Vocational Unions resolved to accept the following\r\nprinciples as a basis for the solution of the question:\r\n\r\n1. Social insurance and labor safeguarding being a complete and\r\nlogically united institution, with the dictatorship of the proletariat\r\nin power, when the entire population of the Russian Socialist Federal\r\nSoviet Republic is being transformed into laborers, covers the\r\nactivities of Commissariat of Health, thus representing under the\r\ncircumstances one of the most important and most necessary links of one\r\nchain.\r\n\r\n2. It is possible to carry into life the measures of social insurance\r\nand labor safeguards with the necessary system and on a vast scale, only\r\nif the work is done in the closest connection and intimate touch with\r\nthe masses that are interested in it, and on the condition that the\r\nmasses cooperate most energetically.\r\n\r\n3. The union of any group of functions into one whole may be determined\r\nexclusively by their proximity and similarity, else there is a\r\npossibility of the least efficient combination of all or any individual\r\nbranches of government activity, to the detriment of the regular\r\ndevelopment and direction of the same and to the certain amount of\r\nindependence so necessary to each and every one of the activities.\r\n\r\n4. The medico-prophylactic activity, like the entire institution for\r\nsocial insurance and labor safeguards, must be united, i.e., both the\r\norganizing and organic work is concentrated in the hands of bodies and\r\ninstitutions specially created for that purpose, and depending from the\r\nsame common central body. As regards the necessary differentiation of\r\nlabor it must be carried out exclusively within the common bodies, but\r\nunder no circumstances must it be done by means of tearing away from\r\nthem of any of the parts closely bound through common problems and\r\npeculiarities of the work, no matter how considerable each of them,\r\ntaken apart, might be.\r\n\r\nIn view of the above principles, the Congress resolves that:\r\n\r\n1. The Commissariat of Public Health must be amalgamated with the\r\nDepartment of Social Insurance and Labor Safeguards.\r\n\r\n2. All organs of social insurance and labor safeguards must be built\r\nfrom top to bottom entirely on the basis of vocational unions’\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n3. The question of the order of uniting the Commissariat of Public\r\nHealth with the Department of Social Insurance and Labor Safeguards of\r\nthe People’s Commissariat of Labor is given over to the Central\r\nExecutive Committee for consideration.\r\n\r\n         CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL WORK OF THE VOCATIONAL UNIONS\r\n                        AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING\r\n\r\n      (_Resolution based on Tzyperovich’s and Kossior’s reports_)\r\n\r\n1. The Socialist revolution has put before the proletariat a series of\r\nthe most important problems in the field of reconstruction.\r\nSimultaneously and in connection with the revolutionization of the\r\neconomic relations, the working class, as the standard-bearer of\r\nSocialism, must get down to the work of creating a proletarian culture,\r\ninstead of that of the bourgeoisie, in order to prepare the masses for\r\nthe complete realization of the Socialist Commonwealth.\r\n\r\n2. The dictatorship of the proletariat, enabling the working class to\r\nfully utilize all the cultural acquisitions of mankind, is already now\r\nputting forward a new creative form of the cultural movement, in the\r\nshape of proletarian cultural organizations.\r\n\r\n3. Vocational unions, as working class organizations, notwithstanding\r\nall their weakness and the isolation of the proletarian cultural\r\norganizations from the masses of the working class must organically\r\nenter into their work, concentrating within them all their activity for\r\nthe general work along questions of science and art and endeavoring with\r\na view to making it sound, to subject their activity to the influence\r\nand guidance of the industrially organized laboring masses.\r\n\r\n4. The Vocational Unions are also facing as an immediate problem the\r\nutilization on as large a scale as possible of those facilities which\r\nhave been created by the Commissariat of Public Education in the matter\r\nof compulsory, and free education, of education for people above school\r\nage, for technical training, etc.\r\n\r\nThe vocational unions must have their representatives in the\r\nCommissariats of Public Education, who are to shed light on the needs of\r\nthe trade union movement and demand that these needs be satisfied\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n5. At the same time, the vocational unions are to continue their\r\ncultural and educational activity, creating educational institutions and\r\norganizations which would answer the immediate problems of the\r\nvocational movement.\r\n\r\n6. The building up of clubs, especially for the districts and provinces,\r\nis desirable. The type of a vocational-political club is preferable, if\r\npossible of a large size.\r\n\r\n7. It is necessary at present to build libraries in the districts. But\r\nfor the central trade-industrial unions special libraries are to a\r\ncertain extent superfluous (outside of special publications, guides,\r\netc.) They can easily and with much greater success be replaced by\r\npublic and municipal libraries, to which the trade-industrial unions\r\nshould turn their attention, by sending to the same the representatives\r\nof their cultural-educational departments, as delegates.\r\n\r\n8. The publishing associations of the individual unions must be\r\ntechnically united into one Publishing Association of the Council of\r\nUnions. The program of the publications must be adapted to the needs of\r\nthe trade union movement, but at the same time it must be so flexible\r\nand elastic as to be of service to the agitational activity of the\r\nunions in various directions (appeals, bulletins, etc.). The\r\namalgamation of the periodic trade-union organs,—is a problem of the\r\nimmediate future. Besides, it is necessary to issue at present a monthly\r\nor semi-monthly magazine in order to explain the general questions of\r\ntheory and practice of the trade-industrial movement.\r\n\r\nThe organization of central expeditions for all trade union publishing\r\nsocieties is already now an imperative necessity.\r\n\r\n9. In order to materialize the above enumerated problems each central\r\nbody of the trade-industrial unions of a given industry is to have its\r\nown cultural and educational department whose activities are to be\r\ncoordinated by the Soviets (councils) of the Vocational Unions at the\r\ncenter and in the local branches.\r\n\r\nOn the question of vocational training the Congress finds that:\r\n\r\n1. Vocational training, as one of the mightiest weapons in the general\r\nsystem of cultural-industrial socialist education of the working class,\r\nmay attain its object on condition that, together with the vocational\r\ntraining of the workers along the lines of skilled labor, they will also\r\nbe given a general industrial education, acquainting them with the\r\ngeneral questions of the condition of technical and industrial\r\ndevelopment, political economy, economic geography, and also the\r\nquestions of administrative and technical management of an enterprise.\r\n\r\n2. Vocational training is concentrated in the hands of the Committee on\r\nVocational Training, which is formed at the Commissariat of Public\r\nEducation of the representatives of the vocational unions. The Committee\r\nis given charge of the general direction, financing and working out of a\r\nsingle program in the field of vocational training. For the management\r\nof each individual school a School Soviet is formed of the\r\nrepresentatives of the vocational union, the Commissariat, and the\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n3. Within each branch of industry, a network of vocational schools is to\r\nbe established as soon as the needs and requirements of the\r\ncorresponding All-Russian Vocational Association are made known. In the\r\nfirst place the schools are being organized in those places and points\r\nfor the preparation of such groups and types, of skilled workers as will\r\nbe found necessary by the proper industrial associations.\r\n\r\n4. The cultural and educational departments of the All-Russian\r\nIndustrial Associations are connected with the Committee on Vocational\r\nTraining of the Commissariat of Education and are to determine both the\r\nquantity and type of school needed and the technical possibility of\r\ntheir opening in this or that particular locality. The Committee is\r\nbound immediately to satisfy these demands, in case of necessity taking\r\na census of the technical personnel available as instructors in\r\nvocational schools.\r\n\r\n5. The vocational unions will utilize the schools for the organization\r\nof courses and lectures on questions of theory and practice of the labor\r\nmovement, striving at their widest possible development and their\r\ntransformation into a disseminator of all kinds of cultural and\r\ntechnical knowledge among the proletarian masses.\r\n\r\n                      THE QUESTION OF PROVISIONING\r\n\r\n         (_A resolution based on Comrade Antzelovich’s report_)\r\n\r\nFully supporting the general principal policy of the Workers’ and\r\nPeasants’ Government on the questions of provisioning and supplying the\r\npopulation, taking into consideration the extraordinary difficulty of\r\nthe food situation, caused by the general conditions of the moment and\r\nby the weakness of the food supplying apparatus, the Congress resolves\r\nto give its best forces to the work of organization of the provisioning\r\nwork, to continue the work of mobilization and centralization for this\r\npurpose of the proletarian forces on an all-Russian scale, and is hereby\r\nsubmitting for the approval of the Council of People’s Commissaries the\r\nprovisions stated below:\r\n\r\n1. The Congress recognizes the War-Provisioning Bureau of the\r\nAll-Russian Soviet of Vocational Unions, acting in accordance with the\r\ninstructions adopted by the Soviet, as the central body in charge of\r\nmobilization and distribution of the proletarian forces in the field of\r\nprovisioning.\r\n\r\nIn order to fulfil its tasks the War-Provisioning Bureau of the\r\nAll-Russian Soviet of Vocational Unions: (_a_) mobilizes the labor\r\npower, selecting it from among the vocational unions and their organs\r\n(the shop committees, etc.); (_b_) promotes the workers into the\r\npositions of members of the colleges, provincial provisioning\r\ncommittees, district provisioning committees, and other provisioning\r\norganizations, appointing them to office through the People’s\r\nCommissariat for provisioning; (_c_) sends the workers’ provisioning\r\ndetachments composed of the best forces into the villages to do the work\r\nof organization. The detachments are working under the leadership of\r\nmembers delegated by the War-Provisioning Bureau into the local\r\nprovisioning bodies, and are to act as auxiliary organizations to those\r\nprovisioning bodies; (_d_) it organizes the provisional expeditions with\r\nspecial tasks to aid the provisioning organizations among them in the\r\nlocalities freed from occupation; (_e_) it organizes the work of labor\r\ninspection, working under the control of the War-Provisioning Bureau,\r\nboth in the field of provisioning and in the allied fields of\r\ntransportation, etc.; the problems of inspection consist of the\r\nrenovation, reorganization and the placing of the entire system of\r\nprovisioning bodies on a proletarian basis; (_f_) it selects with the\r\naid of the proper vocational unions specialists in different lines of\r\nthe provisioning work, making them available to fill executive offices;\r\n(_g_) in its work the Central War-Provisioning Bureau is leaning for\r\nsupport on the auxiliary local war-provisioning bureaus of the Soviets\r\nof Vocational Unions, uniting the entire activity of the vocational\r\nunions for the betterment of the provisioning work.\r\n\r\n2. From the point of view of unity of the general system of distribution\r\nof necessaries, the Congress deems it necessary to put into practice in\r\nfull measure the participation of labor cooperation in the matter of\r\ndistributing the products so that, in the course of time, and labor, all\r\nthe united system of distribution may be organized after the pattern of\r\na single type of consumers’ communes.\r\n\r\nWorkers’ cooperative societies must become the chief distributors of\r\nproducts among the workers.\r\n\r\nConsidering it necessary thus to impose on the workers’ cooperative\r\nsocieties the extremely important task of constructive Socialist work\r\nand the work of actually supplying the workers with the necessaries,\r\nwithout which the productivity of labor cannot be increased, the\r\nCongress holds that these functions can best be carried out by the\r\nworkers’ cooperatives on the following conditions: (_a_) the creation of\r\na united organized basis for the cooperative and vocational associations\r\n(factory or mill committees), which is to be carried into practice by\r\nmeans of an agreement between the All-Russian Council of Vocational\r\nUnions and the All-Russian Council of Workers’ Cooperative Societies;\r\n(_b_) the All-Russian Councils of Vocational Unions and the Workers’\r\nCooperative Societies exchange representatives; (_c_) all members of the\r\nvocational unions must join the Workers’ Cooperative Society and every\r\nmember of the latter must become a member of a vocational union; (_d_)\r\nthe common leading body of the workers’ cooperative societies must be\r\nthe meeting of representatives (conferences) of the shop committees and\r\ncollective associations, uniting the employees and the laborers not\r\noccupied in the mills and factories; (_e_) the workers’ cooperatives\r\nmust immediately be induced to participate in the broadest possible\r\nmanner in the work of organizing all municipal commerce; the control and\r\ngeneral direction in the matter remaining in the hands of the\r\nprovisioning bodies; (_f_) the existing special productive-distributive\r\norgans such as that in charge of transportation of the provisions,\r\nwaterway transportation of provisions, (canals, rivers, etc.), must be\r\ntransformed into well organized, open workers’ cooperative societies;\r\n(_g_) the workers’ cooperative societies are to be induced to take up\r\nthe practical work of organization of these branches of industry whose\r\nscale and problems justify such work, and which are engaged in the\r\nproduction of the prime necessities.\r\n\r\n3. The furnishing of the proletariat with the products provided for it\r\nby the government plans of distribution, must be insured through the\r\nappropriation of a special fund for the purpose on the plan adopted for\r\nthe army. The special department of the Commissariat for Provisioning\r\nwhich is in charge of the planning, calculating, and distributing of the\r\nproducts intended for the workers, must be organized in accordance with\r\nan understanding between the All-Russian Council of Vocational Unions\r\nand the Council of Workers’ Cooperatives, and it must not form its own\r\ntechnical and economic apparatus.\r\n\r\n4. In order to help the methods of proletarian work to permeate more\r\nfully the entire system of the provisioning institutions it is necessary\r\nto inject into their midst representatives of Vocational Unions and\r\nWorkers’ Cooperative Societies, particularly representatives of the\r\nAll-Russian Council of Vocational Unions and the All-Russian Council of\r\nCooperative Societies, into the Collegium of the People’s Commissariat\r\nfor Provisioning.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of preparing the products which are subject to monopoly,\r\nby government counter-agents (as per decree of January 21st) the central\r\nworkers’ cooperatives (city) and all centralized workers’ cooperative\r\norganizations (regional, provincial and all-Russian) are to be called\r\nupon to help, while the matter of preparing the products not subject to\r\nmonopoly should be entirely given over to the cooperative societies,\r\nheaded by the Workers’ Cooperative Society, the management to be given\r\nover to the Central Buying Committee (Tzentrozakup) and a corresponding\r\nportion of the products is to be set aside for the needs of the army.\r\n\r\n5. In order to create a solid basis in the matter of supplying farm\r\nproducts and with a view to intensifying agriculture and other types of\r\nfarming it is necessary to call upon the workers’ cooperative societies\r\nto properly utilize and organize the large Soviet agricultural\r\nestablishments and other farming undertakings.\r\n\r\n6. For the successful solution of its tasks in the domain of Socialist\r\nconstruction work it is necessary to bring about the closest\r\norganizational union and coordination of activity of the vocational\r\nunions and workers’ cooperative societies in the matter of raising the\r\nclass consciousness of that proletariat and, for this purpose, the joint\r\norganization of workers’ homes, clubs, institutes for practitioners, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\n                      THE QUESTION OF ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n               (_Resolution based an M. Tomsky’s report_)\r\n\r\n                                   1.\r\n                           GENERAL PRINCIPLES\r\n\r\n1. Adapting its organizations to the conditions of the economic struggle\r\nin capitalist society, the working class in the interests of economy and\r\nconcentration of its divided forces, gradually passed over from the\r\nclose narrow guild organizations to the broader vocational and, finally,\r\nin the course of struggle against capitalism, building its forces on the\r\nprinciple of more efficient centralization of power for the realization\r\nof its war aims (class war aims), it came to form organizations\r\nembracing all the workers of a given branch of industry (production)\r\ninto one union.\r\n\r\nThe industrial union is one union having the follow-lowing basic\r\ncharacteristics: (_a_) the union rallies all the workers and other\r\nemployees engaged in a given branch of production, regardless of his\r\nfunctions; (_b_) the treasury is centralized; (_c_) the business of the\r\nunion is transacted on the basis of democratic centralization; (_d_) the\r\nwage scales and conditions of labor are determined by one central body\r\nfor all the categories of labor; (_e_) a uniform principle of\r\nconstruction from top to bottom; (_f_) the sections are playing the part\r\nof technical and auxiliary organs; (_g_) the interests of the\r\nindustrially organized workers and other employees of a given industry\r\nare represented before the outside world by one central body.\r\n\r\n2. The industrial union comprises only the permanent workers and\r\nemployees of a given industry who are directly engaged in the process of\r\nproduction or serve to aid the same. All auxiliary branches serving _not\r\nproduction but the producers_ and all the temporary and casual help\r\nremain members of their industrial union.\r\n\r\n3. This principle of construction of our unions recognized by the third\r\nConference of the Vocational Unions, and by the first All-Russian\r\nCongress of Vocational Unions, presupposing the union of all the workers\r\nof a given industry into one organization (union), can be consistently\r\ncarried into practice only by means of uniting all the workers and\r\nemployees (“higher” and “lower”) into one union, which became possible\r\nof realization only after the political and economic prejudices\r\nseparating the laborer from the other employees and from the technical\r\npersonnel have been done away with.\r\n\r\n4. Even if the first Congress of Vocational Unions considered it\r\nimpracticable to unite into one union all the higher employees and\r\nlaborers,—at the present moment, after a year of proletarian\r\ndictatorship during which a good deal of the antagonism between the\r\ndifferent categories of laborers and other employees has been spent,\r\nwhen it has been proved from experience that one union in its turn leads\r\nto the eradication of all antagonism in the midst of the workers—it must\r\nnow be recognized as desirable and necessary to unite into one union all\r\npersons who are wage workers engaged in one establishment, one industry\r\nor one institution.\r\n\r\nOnly in such establishments or institutions where the hiring of laborers\r\nand other employees and the increase or decrease of their wages is being\r\ndecided by one member of the administrative or technical personnel, the\r\nlatter cannot be members of the given union.\r\n\r\n5. The industrial principle of union structure as applied to workers\r\noccupied in other branches of national industries, than manufacture\r\n(transportation, commerce, and farming), and also in institutions\r\nfulfilling definite functions of government (postal-telegraph,\r\nmedico-sanitary departments, education, etc.), must be used to unite the\r\nworkers of small isolated branches of industry and management into more\r\npowerful unions. As a basis for such amalgamation one must take the\r\nsimilarity of conditions of labor and the functions carried out.\r\n\r\n6. Categorically defending the consistent introduction and application\r\nof the principle underlying production as regards all categories of\r\nworkers, not accepting into its labor organizations those unions which\r\nare built on guild, corporation and narrow trade lines, for the purpose\r\nof better serving the economic interests of the most typical industrial\r\ngroups and categories, the organization of sections on a local and\r\nnational scale is allowed within each vocational union.\r\n\r\nThe unions binding together several allied branches of industry have the\r\nright to form industrial sections, the same having the right to call\r\nindependent Congresses in order to decide the questions of their own\r\nindustry, on condition however, that the decisions of such sectional\r\nCongresses, which will be contrary to the rulings of the general\r\nCongress or the regulations of the leading organs of the labor union\r\nmovement, may be annulled by the leading body of the industrial union.\r\n\r\n7. Striving towards unity and smooth work in labor union activity and\r\nthe greatest efficiency in the utilization of the power and means at the\r\ndisposal of the labor unions, it is necessary to recognize most\r\ndefinitely the principle of centralization of the union organization,\r\nbased on unity and centralization of union finances and strict inter-\r\nand intra-union discipline.\r\n\r\n8. With this principle as a starting-point, the _organization of the\r\nsection cannot have the character of open or masked federalism_. Under\r\nno circumstances could the sections be allowed to have separate\r\nsectional treasuries, additional assessment of members of the sections\r\nfor organization and agitation and generally for any work of the union,\r\nneither can they be allowed independent representation outside of the\r\nunion or to build the leading union organs, committees, on the principle\r\nof sectional representation.\r\n\r\n9. In exceptional cases of reconstruction of the existing federated\r\nunions into a centralized industrial union, only as an allowance for the\r\ntransitional stage the Executive Committee elected at the meeting of all\r\nthe delegates or at the meeting of the All-Russian Congress, can be\r\nenlarged through the addition of representatives of the sections, who\r\nthen have no vote, only a voice.\r\n\r\n10. All attempts to violate the principle of industrial organization for\r\nthe purpose of restoring the federated trade unions by means of\r\norganization of the inter-sectional bureaus uniting analogous sections\r\nof the various industrial unions, must be emphatically condemned.\r\n\r\n11. Fighting for the complete annihilation of classes, at this\r\ntransitional period of proletarian dictatorship, the Russian trade-union\r\nmovement aiming at the union of all workers into centralized industrial\r\nunions for the purpose of subjecting the semi-proletarian elements to\r\nthe influence of the economically organized proletariat and inducing it\r\nto enter the class struggle and take part in Socialist reconstruction;\r\nwe think it necessary to get the new, and as yet unorganized, strata of\r\ngovernment and social workers to join the All-Russian Vocational\r\nAssociations, on condition of their complete submission to proletarian\r\ndiscipline and to all regulations of the leading central bodies of the\r\ntrade union movement, and particularly, the principles of organization.\r\n\r\n12. At the same time it would be the greatest error at the present stage\r\nof development of our trade union movement with its insufficient degree\r\nof organization, to infuse into it the craftsmen and small shop owners\r\nwho due to their isolation and unorganized state, do not allow of\r\nproletarian control; the same applies to the labor “artels,” “unions of\r\nlabor communes” and so-called professional people who are not wage\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nBeing the representatives of the dying crafts and petty bourgeois\r\nindustry, these elements permeated with the conservative economic\r\nideology of individual and small-scale production (artel), due to their\r\nnumerical size, are liable to disorganize the ranks of the economically\r\norganized proletariat.\r\n\r\n13. Considering as the only correct and fundamental basis for the union\r\nof the workers into industrial unions, the economic basis (the economic\r\npart played by the groups of laborers in the general system of national\r\neconomy), the All-Russian Vocational Association cannot accept into its\r\nmidst unions _built along national, religious, and generally, any unions\r\nnot built along economic lines_.\r\n\r\n14. Uniting the laborers and other employees into unions, independently\r\nof their political and religious beliefs, the Russian trade union\r\nmovement as a whole, taking the position of the international class\r\nstruggle, resolutely condemns the idea of neutralism, and considers it a\r\nprerequisite for the admission of individual unions into the all-Russian\r\nand local associations—that they recognize the revolutionary class\r\nstruggle for the realization of socialism _by means of the dictatorship\r\nof the proletariat_.\r\n\r\n15. Regarding the Russian labor-union movement as one close proletarian\r\nclass organization, having one common class aim—to win and organize the\r\nsocialist system, one must admit that _any member of any industrial\r\nunion_, affiliated with the all-Russian or local union council, who is\r\nfulfilling his duties as such, being at the same time a member of the\r\nAll-Russian General Vocational Association, upon being transferred from\r\none industry to another, _joins the proper union with the rights of an\r\nold member_, without paying any initiation fee. No one must be at the\r\nsame time a member of two unions.\r\n\r\n16. This latter rule wholly applies also to the group transfer of whole\r\nestablishments from one union to another—_no payments are to be made out\r\nof the treasury of the unions, nor are to be made either to the members\r\nwho leave it or to the union into which they are transferred_, by the\r\nfirst union.\r\n\r\n17. Endeavoring to better the economic conditions of all the workers,\r\nregardless of whether they are members of the union or not, the unions\r\ntaking upon themselves the responsibility for the proper functioning of\r\nan establishment or institution, for the labor discipline among the\r\nworkers and the enforcement of the union regulations of wages and\r\nstandards of production, the unions must endeavor _to introduce\r\ncompulsory membership_ in all the establishments and institutions\r\nentering into it, _through resolutions adopted at general meetings of\r\nthe workers_.\r\n\r\n18. Recognizing _the necessity of a united plan for the construction of\r\nall trade unions_ as the only condition insuring right relations between\r\nthe individual local organizations and their centers, also insuring the\r\nenforcement of union regulations and union discipline, the second\r\nCongress thinks it necessary, for the purpose of creating unity of\r\nactivity on a local as well as national scale, to adopt a united scheme\r\nfor the structure of the industrial unions and their combines.\r\n\r\n                                   2.\r\n             THE STRUCTURE OF THE TRADE UNIONS AND SOVIETS:\r\n\r\n1. The highest directing body of the all-Russian labor union movement is\r\nthe All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions and the All-Russian Central\r\nSoviet of Vocational Unions operating from one Congress to the other, on\r\nthe basis of principle regulations adopted by the Congress.\r\n\r\n          _Note._ A conference is called only in case it is\r\n          impossible to call a properly organized congress.\r\n\r\n2. All regulations of the All-Russian Congresses, Conferences and the\r\nAll-Russian Central Council of the Industrial Unions are compulsory not\r\nonly to all the unions, affiliated with the All-Russian Vocational\r\nAssociation, but for every individual member of a union, as well.\r\n\r\n3. _Violation of the rules and disregard of the same on the part of\r\nindividual unions_ carries with it expulsion of such a union from the\r\nfamily of the proletarian unions.\r\n\r\n4. The supreme organ of the All-Russian Industrial Union is its Central\r\nCommittee; all rulings of that committee which do not contradict the\r\nregulations issued by the higher councils of the All-Russian General\r\nVocational Association are obligatory for all of its branches and for\r\neach and every one of its members.\r\n\r\n5. All local councils of the unions are being constructed according to\r\nthe plan of the All-Russian Central Council of the Vocational Unions,\r\nwith a corresponding proportional change of numerical ratio. All\r\ncongresses of vocational unions are being called on the principle of\r\ndirect proportion.\r\n\r\n6. The rulings of the All-Russian Industrial Unions cannot be nullified\r\nby the rulings of the local councils of unions and are obligatory for\r\nthe organs of the given union in each locality.\r\n\r\n7. The local councils of the Vocational Unions being the leading organs\r\nof the labor union movement and authorized representatives of the entire\r\nproletariat, economically organized within a certain locality, are at\r\nthe same time guided in their activities by all the rules of the\r\nAll-Russian Congresses, Conferences and the All-Russian Central Council\r\nof the Trade-Industrial Unions, and as regards the branches of the\r\nindustrial unions, the regulations laid down by their guiding central\r\nbodies are obligatory. The rulings of the local Trade Union Councils\r\nwhich are in contradiction to the regulations of the policy of the\r\nentire unions or their managing bodies, are not obligatory for the local\r\nbranches of the industrial unions.\r\n\r\n8. The branches of the All-Russian Industrial Unions affiliated with the\r\nAll-Russian Central Trade Unions Council automatically enter into the\r\nlocal Trade Union Councils.\r\n\r\n9. The local Trade Union Councils are to see to it that the unions are\r\nproperly organized, and that they follow the directions issued by the\r\ngoverning bodies and fulfil their financial obligations towards the\r\nunions; they are also to aid and support them in their activities.\r\n\r\n10. In the interests of centralization of union activity, the\r\nstrengthening of the ties between the centers and the local bodies, and\r\nin order to place the finances of the unions on a proper plane and bring\r\nabout closer cooperation and connection between the trade unions on the\r\none hand, and the organs of the Supreme Council of National Economy and\r\nthe Commissariat of Labor, on the other, in the work of bringing about a\r\nuniform structure of the Trade Unions and Union Councils and\r\nstandardizing the wage scales throughout the country,—one must admit\r\nthat the geographical (provincial) amalgamations as well as the\r\nprovincial Union Councils are only unnecessary organs of transmission\r\nbetween the center and the periphery which constitute a nonproductive\r\nexpenditure of energy and means.\r\n\r\n11. The All-Russian Centers, their branches and subdivisions in the\r\nvarious localities, united through the Trade Union Councils, constructed\r\nafter the pattern of the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council, the\r\nShop Committees or Employees’ Associations (Collective Associations) as\r\nthe original _nuclei_ of the trade unions—this is the best scheme of\r\norganization structure, answering the basic problems at the present\r\nmoment confronting the trade union movement. Territorial grouping\r\naccording to divisions and subdivisions should be established by the\r\nAll-Russian Central body of the given union, depending upon the\r\ngeographical area and degree of concentration of any given branch of\r\nindustry, keeping, insofar as possible within the boundaries fixed by\r\nthe administrative divisions.\r\n\r\nOnly by observing the given scheme of organization can the finances of\r\nthe union be placed on a proper level and the centers receive due\r\nfinancial strength, which is a necessary condition for further and more\r\nsystematic activity.\r\n\r\n12. The most suitable principle by which to determine the membership\r\ndues during the period of chronic depreciation of paper money would be a\r\nproportional assessment. The normal amount of membership dues, the\r\nCongress considers is one per cent of the wages earned. Special\r\nadditional dues or assessments for special needs of the local divisions\r\nof the industrial unions are allowed only upon the resolution of general\r\nmeetings, or meetings of delegates or conferences of a given union.\r\n\r\n13. Regarding the Branch of the Industrial Union (within a province or\r\nregion) as the highest organ of the union in the given locality\r\n(government or region), as the first step toward the actual realization\r\nof the centralization of the union funds, the Congress considers the\r\nfollowing financial relations as necessary:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Fifty per cent of all membership dues of the branches of the\r\nAll-Russian Central Industrial Union go to the All-Russian Central\r\nCommittee of the given Industrial Union.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The divisions (district and sub-regional) of a branch (government\r\nor region) of a Union work according to the budget approved by the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Ten per cent of all the funds remaining at the disposal of a\r\nbranch of a union goes to the local Trade Union Council.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The local bureaus of the Trade Unions (in small towns) exist on 10\r\nper cent of the budget appropriated by the branch of the industrial\r\nunion to its divisions.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The local unions which are not affiliated with any all-Russian\r\nunion associations are to give 10 per cent to the local Trade Union\r\nCouncil, and 10 per cent to the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council\r\ntransferred through the local Trade Union Council.\r\n\r\n14. All trade organizations as well as members who have not met their\r\nfinancial obligations within three months without sufficient reasons,\r\nare automatically expelled from their union and from the All-Russian\r\nTrade Association, and can be reinstated only upon payment of the sum\r\nthey owe plus the usual initiation fee.\r\n\r\n15. The following initiation fees are to be fixed: (_a_) half a day’s\r\nwages for individual members entering the union, (_b_) the All-Russian\r\nTrade Union upon entering the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council\r\npays 10 per cent of all the initiation fees collected from the total\r\nnumber of its members, (_c_) the same amount is paid by all the branches\r\nof the All-Russian Trade Unions upon their admission into the local\r\nTrade Union Council, (_d_) the local unions which have no all-Russian\r\ntrade union pay upon entering the local council 10 per cent of the\r\ninitiation fees collected, a half of which amount goes to the\r\nAll-Russian Central Trade Union Council.\r\n\r\n16. In the interests of the development of union activity with the\r\npresent character of the Russian trade union movement, all special funds\r\nwhich cannot be touched, such as the strike fund, the reserve funds,\r\netc., must be annulled as such and added to the rest of the union’s\r\ngeneral treasury. The fund for the aid of unions outside of Soviet\r\nRussia is being created by the All-Russian Central Trade Union Council\r\nfor which purpose special collections and contributions are to be used.\r\n\r\n17. In the interests of the proper arrangement of the control system,\r\nthe simplification and systematization of the union’s business, we must\r\nmake it obligatory to have a single uniform system, as worked out by the\r\nAll-Russian Central Trade Union Council.\r\n\r\n18. The basic nucleus of the Industrial Union on the spot is the Factory\r\nCommittee or the Collective Association of the office employees in the\r\nform of an Office Workers’ Union.\r\n\r\n19. “Regulations of the Factory and Mill Committees” adopted by the\r\nMoscow Trade Union Council and approved by the All-Russian Central\r\nCouncil of the Industrial Unions coordinated with the resolutions of the\r\npresent second All-Russian Congress of Trade Unions must be used as the\r\nbasis for the determination of the part, the tasks and interrelations of\r\nthe Factory and Mill Committees with the other organizations.\r\n\r\n20. As a basis for the regulations governing the Employees’ Associations\r\n(Collective Associations), in addition to the general principles which\r\nform the basis of the “Factory and Mill Committee Regulations,” the\r\nfollowing principles are to be laid down:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Participation in the hiring and dismissal of employees, (_b_)\r\nobligatory participation in the Wage Scale Committees and endeavor to\r\nsee to it that the wage scale regulations be carried out in practice,\r\n(_c_) the recognition of the collective association and its rights to\r\nexist only as an organ of the corresponding union, (_d_) participation\r\nin the organization and improvement of the technical apparatus of the\r\ngiven institution, (_e_) non-interference with the general direction of\r\nthe activities of the state and social institutions.\r\n\r\nThe All-Russian Central Trade Union Council is authorized within the\r\nshortest time to work out and publish the regulations of the Factory and\r\nMill Committees and the Employees’ Collective Associations.\r\n\r\n21. To avoid mixing up of terms and ideas regarding the character of the\r\nunion organs we must recognize the uniform terminology of the same, as\r\ncarrying out the same functions, namely:\r\n\r\n(_a_) All-Russian Central Trade Union Council retains its name, (_b_)\r\nthe leading organs of the All-Russian Trade Unions are called “Central\r\nCommittee of the Trade Unions,” their executive organs are to be called:\r\n“Presidium of the Central Committee of the Trade Unions,” (_c_) their\r\ngovernment (province) organs—“The management of the government\r\n(province) or regional branch of the All-Russian Trade Union,” (_d_) the\r\nLocal Government Trade Union Councils are called: “Such and such\r\nGovernment Trade Union Council,” and the district councils as well as\r\nthe small town councils “Such and such District Trade Union Bureau,”\r\n“Such and such Trade Union Bureau.”\r\n\r\n22. All-Russian Central Trade Union Council on the basis of the\r\nprinciples laid down, must work out in the shortest possible period the\r\nfollowing sample by-laws which are to be obligatory for all trade\r\norganizations affiliated with any of the following All-Russian Trade\r\nAssociations:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The All-Russian Trade Union, (_b_) local union having no\r\ncorresponding all-Russian association, (_c_) Local Trade Union Council,\r\n(_d_) Trade Union Bureau.\r\n\r\n23. The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council must work out and enact\r\nthrough the People’s Commissariat of Labor and the Soviet of National\r\nEconomy or the All-Russian Central Executive Committee, the regulations\r\ngoverning the coalitions on the following basis: (_a_) the right to be\r\ncalled a union is given only to trade unions affiliated with the\r\nAll-Russian Central Trade Union Council, registered and published by the\r\nlatter, (_b_) all other organizations of an economic character not\r\naffiliated with the All-Russian Trade Association are to be called\r\n“societies.”\r\n\r\n24. The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council and the government\r\ncouncils must periodically report on all unions registered with it.\r\n\r\n25. In accordance with the general principles of organization, adopted\r\nat the second Trade Union Congress the corresponding amendments are to\r\nbe introduced into the by-laws of the All-Russian Central Trade Union\r\nCouncil adopted by the first All-Russian Trade Union Congress.\r\n\r\n        BY-LAWS OF THE ALL-RUSSIAN CENTRAL TRADES UNION COUNCIL\r\n\r\n                (_Amended and approved by the Congress_)\r\n\r\n1. The All-Russian Trade Union Congress elects an executive body of the\r\nAll-Russian Central Trades Union Council—the presiding officers\r\n(Presidium), who are to submit a detailed report on their activity to\r\nthe following Congress.\r\n\r\n2. The supreme leading body of the All-Russian Trade-Union Association\r\nis the All-Russian Central Trade-Union Council, which is to be guided in\r\nits activity by resolutions of congresses and conferences and which is\r\nresponsible for its actions to the All-Russian Trades Union Congress.\r\n\r\n3. All the regulations of the All-Russian Congresses, Conferences as\r\nwell as those passed by the All-Russian Central Trades Union Council are\r\nobligatory to all unions affiliated with the All-Russian Trades Union\r\nAssociation as well as to every union member. The violation of these\r\nrules and disobedience of the same carries with it expulsion from the\r\nfamily of proletarian unions.\r\n\r\n4. The All-Russian Central Council is to fulfil the following tasks:\r\n\r\n(_a._) It is to maintain and establish a connection with all the\r\nexisting and newly arising trade union organizations;\r\n\r\n(_b._) It is to aid in the creation of local all-Russian vocational\r\nunions as well as the amalgamation of all trades;\r\n\r\n(_c._) It is to establish connections with the central trade union\r\nbodies of all countries;\r\n\r\n(_d._) It is to carry out all the necessary work connected with the\r\npreparation and calling of All-Russian conferences and congresses, it\r\nworks out a program of business to be transacted by the congresses, it\r\ntakes care of the preparation of reports, and it publishes the\r\nfundamental principles;\r\n\r\n(_e._) It appoints the time for the calling of conferences and\r\ncongresses;\r\n\r\n(_f._) It periodically publishes in the press reports on its activities;\r\n\r\n(_g._) It issues its bulletin (periodical organ);\r\n\r\n(_h._) It connects, and acts as representative for the entire\r\ntrade-union movement before the Central government institutions and\r\nsocial organizations;\r\n\r\n(_i._) It aids the unions in their work of organization and guides that\r\nwork, for which purpose it issues various by-laws, instructions, forms\r\nof accounting (book-keeping), etc.;\r\n\r\n(_j._) It takes part in organizations and institutions, serving the\r\ninterests of cultural and educational activity among the proletariat;\r\n\r\n(_k._) It aids in promoting the development of the trade union movement,\r\nby means of verbal and written propaganda and agitation.\r\n\r\n6. In order to accomplish its tasks successfully, the All-Russian\r\nCentral Trades Union Council organizes the necessary departments.\r\n\r\n7. The funds of the All-Russian Central Trades-Union Council consist of\r\nthe following: (_a_) 10 per cent of the membership dues collected by the\r\nCentral Committees of the All-Russian Trade Union Association; (_b_)\r\nfive per cent of the revenue coming from the local unions not affiliated\r\nwith the All-Russian Trade Unions, but affiliated, through the local\r\nSoviet, with the All-Russian All-Trades Association, (_c_) out of\r\nappropriations designated by the organs of the Soviet Government for\r\nspecific purposes.\r\n\r\n8. The All-Russian Central Trade Union Council is composed of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Nine members elected by the Congress, and\r\n\r\n(_b_) Representatives of the All-Russian Trade Unions, on the basis of\r\none delegate to every 30,000 to 50,000 workers, and one more delegate to\r\nevery additional 50,000 dues-paying members.\r\n\r\n_Note._ All-Russian Trades Unions whose membership is below 30,000, send\r\ntheir representative, who has a voice, but no vote. Unions whose\r\ndues-paying membership is below 30,000 may unite and send a delegate to\r\nthe All-Russian Trades Union Council, who will then have the right to\r\nvote at the meetings.\r\n\r\n9. The nine members elected by the congress are to be the presiding\r\nofficers of the All-Russian Central Council; in order to effect a change\r\nin the composition of the presidium, a vote of not less than two-thirds\r\nof the general number of members of the All-Russian Central Council is\r\nrequired, or if the All-Russian Associations demand the recall of that\r\nbody, the total membership of the associations demanding such recall\r\nmust exceed one-half of the entire membership of the All-Russian\r\nAssociation comprising all trades.\r\n\r\n_Note._ The members of the presidium (executive committee), are to be\r\nreplaced (in case they resign or are recalled) at the plenary session of\r\nthe All-Russian Central Trade Union Council.\r\n\r\n10. Such recall and election of a new executive body may take place only\r\nin extraordinary cases when the general conditions do not permit the\r\ncalling of an extraordinary congress or conference.\r\n\r\n11. A plenary session of the All-Russian Central Council takes place at\r\nleast once a month. The All-Russian Central Council at a meeting of all\r\nits members elects an auditing committee and other committees and\r\nresponsible officers, leaving to the executive committee (presiding\r\nofficers) to organize branches (departments), to invite workers to join\r\nthem, etc.\r\n\r\n12. The All-Russian Conference of Trades-Unions is to consist of all the\r\nmembers of the council (Soviet), and of representatives of provincial\r\ntrades-union councils—one to every 25,000 members.\r\n\r\n_Note._ Representatives of All-Russian Associations who are admitted to\r\nthe plenary session (_plenum_) with only a voice and no vote, have the\r\nright to vote at the conference.\r\n\r\n13. The All-Russian Central Trades Union calls congresses of the trades\r\nunions at intervals not longer than one year. Extraordinary congresses\r\nare called at the decision of the All-Russian Central Council, at the\r\ndemand of All-Russian Associations, or in cases where the All-Russian\r\nAssociations having not less than half the total membership affiliated\r\nwith the All-Russian Workmen’s Association, demand that an extraordinary\r\nconvention be called.\r\n\r\n14. The right to representation at the Trades-Union Congresses is\r\nrestricted to those unions which in their activity are guided by the\r\nprinciples of the international class struggle of the proletariat, which\r\nare affiliated with the local councils of the trades unions and which\r\npay their dues regularly.\r\n\r\n15. The following have a right to vote at the congress:\r\n\r\n(_a_) The local trades unions having a dues-paying membership of no less\r\nthan 3,000, are entitled to one delegate, and those whose membership\r\nexceeds 5,000 are entitled to one delegate for every 5,000 dues-paying\r\nmembers (complete 5,000 only, not for any fraction thereof).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The central All-Russian Associations are entitled to one delegate\r\neach; but in case the total number of workers affiliated with them\r\nexceeds 10,000 they are entitled to two delegates.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Petrograd and Moscow send three delegates each.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Local unions having under 3,000 members may amalgamate for the\r\npurpose of sending their delegates.\r\n\r\n16. The following have a voice, but no vote:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Representatives of the central bodies of Socialist parties; of the\r\nAll-Russian Central Executive Committee of the Council (Soviet) of\r\nWorkers’ and Peasants’ Delegates; individuals and institutions at the\r\ninvitation of the All-Russian Central Council or the Congress itself.\r\n\r\n(_b_) All members of the All-Russian Central Soviet.\r\n\r\n17. The rules of procedure for the congress (convention) are worked out\r\nby the All-Russian Central Council and are subject to approval by the\r\ncongress.\r\n\r\n18. The order of business (program) to be transacted at the convention\r\nis to be made public at least one month before the congress is convened.\r\nIndividual organizations have the right to introduce new points into the\r\norder of business not later than two weeks prior to the meeting of the\r\ncongress, of which changes the All-Russian Central Council immediately\r\nnotifies, through the press, all the trades unions.\r\n\r\n        ORDER OF ADMISSION OF ALL-RUSSIAN TRADES UNIONS INTO THE\r\n               ALL-RUSSIAN CENTRAL TRADES UNIONS COUNCIL\r\n\r\n19. An All-Russian Trades Union, desiring to enter the All-Trade\r\nAssociation must submit to the presidium of the All-Russian Central\r\nTrades Union Council the following documents:\r\n\r\n(_a_) the by-laws,\r\n\r\n(_b_) information on the number of dues-paying members,\r\n\r\n(_c_) information on the existing branches and number of dues-paying\r\nmembers of each of them,\r\n\r\n(_d_) minutes of any convention or conference at which the central\r\ncommittee of the organization has been elected,\r\n\r\n(_e_) financial report,\r\n\r\n(_f_) sample copies of such publications as the All-Russian Trades Union\r\nhas published, and all other material shedding light on the character of\r\nthe union’s works.\r\n\r\n20. An All-Russian Trades Union may be registered with, and admitted\r\ninto, the All-Russian Central Trades Union Council on the following\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n(_a_) the by-laws and the structure of the union are to be brought into\r\naccord with the general principles of organization as adopted by the\r\nconvention and carried out by the All-Russian Central Trades Union\r\nCouncil;\r\n\r\n(_b_) the character and activity of the union must not contradict the\r\nresolutions of the All-Russian Trades Union Convention or the general\r\ntendencies of the Russian trades union movement;\r\n\r\n(_c_) the payment of a corresponding initiation fee;\r\n\r\n21. An all-Russian union may be expelled at a plenary session from the\r\nAll-Russian Central Trades Union Council on the following grounds:\r\n\r\n(_a_) failure to obey the general rules of discipline obligatory to all\r\ntrades union organizations;\r\n\r\n(_b_) failure to pay membership dues within three months, without any\r\nreasonable cause.\r\n\r\n22. The All-Russian Central Trades Union Council, in cases where the\r\ncentral committee of the All-Russian Trades Union violates the decisions\r\nof the convention, conference, or All-Russian Central Trades Union\r\nCouncil, may dissolve the same, and must immediately call an All-Russian\r\nconvention or conference of the given trades union for the purpose of\r\nelecting a new directing body.\r\n\r\n                                           November 7, 1919.\r\n\r\n         THE FINANCIAL POLICY AND THE RESULTS OF THE ACTIVITIES\r\n                OF THE PEOPLE’S COMMISSARIAT OF FINANCE\r\n\r\n                              (1917–1919)\r\n\r\n                                   I\r\n\r\nWhen the Soviet Government was first organized, a number of purely\r\nfinancial questions arose which necessitated the utilization of the\r\nservices of the old financial-administrative apparatus in the form in\r\nwhich it existed prior to the October Revolution. It is quite natural\r\nthat the first period of work in the domain of finance, that is, between\r\nthe October Revolution and the Brest-Litovsk Peace, had of necessity to\r\nbe marked by efforts to conquer the financial apparatus, its central as\r\nwell as its local bodies, to make a study of its own functions and,\r\nsomehow or other, to adapt itself to the requirements of the time.\r\n\r\nWhile in the domain of the Soviet Government’s economic and general\r\npolicy, this period has been marked by two most far-reaching and\r\nimportant changes which, strictly speaking, had been prepared prior to\r\nthe October Revolution—the nationalization of banks and the annulment of\r\nthe government debt; the financial policy, in the narrow sense of the\r\nword, did not disclose any new departures, not even the beginnings of\r\noriginal constructive work.\r\n\r\nGradually taking over the semi-ruined pre-revolutionary financial\r\napparatus, however, the Soviet Government was compelled to adopt\r\nmeasures for the systematization of the country’s finances in their\r\nentirety.\r\n\r\nThis second period in the work of the People’s Commissariat for Finances\r\n(approximately up to August, 1918) also fails to show any features of\r\nsharply marked revolutionary change. From the very beginning the\r\nauthorities have been confronted with a chaotic condition of the\r\ncountry’s financial affairs. All this, in connection with the large\r\ndeficit which became apparent in the state budget, compelled the\r\nCommissariat of Finance to concentrate its immediate attention on\r\nstraightening the general run of things and, thus, prepare the ground\r\nfor further reforms.\r\n\r\nIn order to accomplish the systematizing of the financial structure, the\r\nGovernment had to lean for support on the already existing unreformed\r\ninstitutions, i.e., the central department of finance, the local\r\nadministrative-financial organs—the fiscal boards tax inspection,\r\ntreasuries, excise boards—and, more particularly, the financial organs\r\nof the former local institutions for self-government (Zemstvos, and\r\nmunicipalities).\r\n\r\nSuch a plan of work seemed most feasible, since the apparatus appeared\r\nsuitable for fulfilling slightly modified functions; but the local\r\ngovernment was not yet sufficiently crystallized or firmly established,\r\nneither was any stable connection established between that local\r\ngovernment and the central bodies.\r\n\r\nUnder such circumstances, the old institutions, which by force of habit\r\ncontinued to work exclusively at the dictate of and in accordance with\r\ninstructions from the central bodies, seemed to be the most convenient\r\nand efficient means of carrying out measures which the central\r\nauthorities had planned to straighten out the general disorder\r\nprevailing in financial affairs.\r\n\r\nHowever, this idea soon had to be discarded, the local Soviets insofar\r\nas they organized themselves and put their executive organs into\r\ndefinite shape, could not and did not have the right to neglect the work\r\nof the old financial organs functioning in the various localities, since\r\nthe Soviets represented the local organs of the central government as a\r\nwhole, and since it was upon them that the responsibility for all the\r\nwork done in the localities, rested.\r\n\r\nUnder such conditions friction was inevitable. In accordance with the\r\nprinciples of the old bureaucratic order, the local financial\r\ninstitutions neither knew nor had any idea of subordination other than\r\nthe slavish subordination to the central authorities which excluded all\r\ninitiative on their part.\r\n\r\nUnder the new conditions, these local financial institutions were to\r\nconstitute only a small component part of the local Soviets. Acute\r\nmisunderstanding of the local authorities among themselves and between\r\nthe local and central authorities on the subject of interrelations among\r\nall of these institutions, have demonstrated the imperative necessity\r\nfor a reorganization. With this work of reforming the local financial\r\norgans (September, 1918) a new period opened: the third period in the\r\nactivity of the commissariat, which coincides with the gradual\r\nstrengthening of the general course of our economic policy. The economic\r\npolicy definitely and decisively occupies the first place which duly\r\nbelongs to it, while the financial policy, insofar as it is closely\r\nbound up with the economic policy, is being regulated and directed in\r\naccordance with the general requirements of the latter.\r\n\r\n                                   II\r\n\r\nThe financial policy of Soviet Russia was, for the first time,\r\ndefinitely outlined by the eighth (March, 1919) Convention of the\r\nRussian Communist Party.\r\n\r\nThe eighth party convention clearly and concretely stated our financial\r\nproblems for the transitionary period, and now our task consists in\r\nseeing to it that the work of the financial organs of the Republic\r\nshould be in accord with the principles accepted by the party.\r\n\r\nThese principles, briefly, are as follows: (1) Soviet Government State\r\nmonopoly of the banking institutions; (2) radical reconstruction and\r\nsimplifications of the banking operations, by means of transforming the\r\nbanking apparatus into one of uniform accounting and general bookkeeping\r\nfor the Soviet Republic; (3) the enactment of measures widening the\r\nsphere of accounting without the medium of money, with the final object\r\nof total elimination of money; (4) and, in view of the transformation of\r\nthe government power into an organization fulfilling the functions of\r\neconomic management for the entire country,—the transformation of the\r\npre-revolutionary state budget into the budget of the economic life of\r\nthe nation as a whole.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the necessity for covering the expenses of the functioning\r\nstate apparatus during the period of transition, the program adopted\r\noutlines the following plan: “The Russian Communist Party will advocate\r\nthe transition from the system of levying contributions from the\r\ncapitalists, to a proportional income and property tax: and, insofar as\r\nthis tax outlives itself, due to the widely applied expropriation of the\r\npropertied classes, the government expenditures must be covered by the\r\nimmediate conversion of part of the income derived from the various\r\nstate monopolies into government revenue.”\r\n\r\nIn short, we arrive at the conclusion that no purely financial policy,\r\nin its pre-revolutionary sense of independence and priority, can or\r\nought to exist in Soviet Russia. The financial policy plays a subsidiary\r\npart, for it depends directly upon the economic policy and upon the\r\nchanges which occur in the various phases of Russia’s political and\r\neconomic order.\r\n\r\nDuring the transitional period from capitalism to Socialism the\r\ngovernment concentrates all of its attention on the organization of\r\nindustry and on the activities of the organs for exchange and\r\ndistribution of commodities.\r\n\r\nThe financial apparatus is an apparatus subsidiary to the organs of\r\nproduction and distribution of merchandise. During the whole of this\r\ntransitional period the financial administration is confronted with the\r\nfollowing task: (1) supplying the productive and distributive organs\r\nwith money, as a medium of exchange, not even abolished by economic\r\nevolution, and (2) the formation of an accounting system, with the aid\r\nof which the government materialize the exchange and distribution of\r\nproducts. Finally, since all the practical work in the domain of\r\nnational and financial economy cannot and should not proceed otherwise\r\nthan in accordance with a strictly defined plan, it is the function of\r\nthe financial administration to create and compile the state budget in\r\nsuch a manner that it might approximate as closely as possible the\r\nbudget of the entire national economic life.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, one of the largest problems of the Commissariat of\r\nFinance was the radical reform of the entire administration of the\r\nDepartment of Finance, from top to bottom, in such a manner that the\r\nfundamental need of the moment would be realized most fully—the\r\nrealization of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the poorest\r\npeasantry in the financial sphere.\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThe work of the financial institutions for the solution of the first\r\nproblem of our financial policy, i.e., the monopolization of the entire\r\nbanking business in the hands of the Soviet Government, may be\r\nconsidered as having been completed during the past year.\r\n\r\nThe private commercial banks were nationalized on December 14, 1917, but\r\neven after this act there still remained a number of private credit\r\ninstitutions. Among these foremost was the “Moscow People’s Bank”\r\n(Moscow Narodny Bank) a so-called cooperative institution. There were\r\nalso societies for mutual credit, foreign banks (Lion Credit Warsaw\r\nBank, Caucasian Bank, etc.); and private land banks, city and government\r\n(provisional) credit associations.\r\n\r\nFinally, together with the Moscow People’s Bank there existed government\r\ninstitutions—savings banks, and treasuries. A number of measures were\r\nrequired to do away with that lack of uniformity involved and to prepare\r\nthe ground for the formation of a uniform accounting system.\r\n\r\nA number of decrees of the Soviet of People’s Commissaries and\r\nregulations issued by the People’s Commissariat of Finance, have\r\ncompleted all this work from September 1918 to May 1919.\r\n\r\nBy a decree of October 10th, 1918, the Societies for Mutual Credit were\r\nliquidated; three decrees of December 2nd, 1918, liquidated the foreign\r\nbanks, regulated the nationalization of the Moscow People’s\r\n(Cooperative) Bank and the liquidation of the municipal banks; and,\r\nfinally, on May 17th, 1919, the city and state Mutual Credit\r\nAssociations were liquidated. As regards the question of consolidating\r\nthe treasuries with the offices of the People’s Bank, this has been\r\nprovided in a decree issued on October 31st, 1918; the amalgamation of\r\nthe savings banks with the People’s Bank has been affected on April\r\n10th, 1918.\r\n\r\nThus, with the issuance of all the above-mentioned decrees, all the\r\nprivate credit associations have been eliminated and all existing\r\nGovernment Credit Institutions have been consolidated into one People’s\r\nBank of the Russian Republic. The last step in the process of reform was\r\nthe decree of the People’s Commissariat of Finance which consolidated\r\nthe State Treasury Department with the central administration of the\r\nPeople’s Bank. This made possible, by uniting the administration of\r\nthese organs, the enforcement of the decree concerning the amalgamation\r\nof the treasuries with the People’s Bank. The decree of the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Finance of October 29th, 1918, issued pursuant to\r\nSection 902 of rules on state and county financial organs, practically\r\nends the entire reform of uniting the treasuries with the institutions\r\nof the Bank.\r\n\r\nThis reform constitutes the greatest revolutionary departure, in strict\r\naccordance with the instructions contained in the party program. Prior\r\nto the completion of this reform, the old pre-revolutionary principle\r\ncontinued to prevail—that of opposition of the State Treasury to the\r\nState Bank, which was independent financially, having its own means,\r\noperating at the expense of its capital stock, and acting as a\r\ndepository for the funds of the State Treasury and as its creditor.\r\nInsofar as the new scheme of our financial life has been realized, this\r\ndualism, has finally disappeared in the process of realization of the\r\nreform. The Bank has now actually become the only budget-auditing\r\nsavings account machinery of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet\r\nRepublic. At the present moment it is serving all the departments of the\r\nstate administration, in the sense that it meets all the government\r\nexpenditures and receives all the state revenue. It takes care of all\r\naccounting between the governmental institutions, on the one hand, and\r\nthe private establishments and individuals on the other. Through the\r\nhands of the People’s Bank pass all the budgets of all institutions and\r\nenterprises, even the state budget itself; in it is concentrated the\r\ncentral bookkeeping which is to unify all the operations and to give a\r\ngeneral picture of the national economic balance.\r\n\r\nThus, we may consider that the fundamental work, i.e., \"the\r\nmonopolization of the entire banking business in the hands of the Soviet\r\nGovernment, the radical alteration and the simplification of banking\r\noperations by means of converting the banking apparatus into an\r\napparatus for uniform accounting and general bookkeeping of the Soviet\r\nRepublic\"—has been accomplished by the Commissariat of Finance.\r\n\r\n                                   IV\r\n\r\nAs regards the carrying into practice of a number of measures intended\r\nto widen the sphere of accounting without the aid of money, the\r\nCommissariat of Finance has, during the period above referred to,\r\nundertaken some steps insofar as this was possible under the\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\nAs long as the state did not overcome the shortage of manufactured\r\narticles, caused by the general dislocation of industrial life, and as\r\nlong as it could arrange for a moneyless direct exchange of commodities\r\nwith the villages, nothing else remains for it than to take, insofar as\r\npossible, all possible steps to reduce the instances where money is used\r\nas a medium of exchange. Through an increase of moneyless operations\r\nbetween the departments, and between the government and individuals,\r\neconomically dependent upon it, the ground is prepared for the abolition\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nThe first step in this direction was the decree of the Soviet of\r\nPeople’s Commissaries of January 23rd, 1919, on accounting operations,\r\ncontaining regulations on the settling of merchandise accounts\r\n(products, raw material, manufactured articles, etc.) among Soviet\r\ninstitutions, and also among such industrial and commercial\r\nestablishments as have been nationalized, taken over by the\r\nmunicipalities, or are under the control of the Supreme Council of\r\nNational Economy, the People’s Commissariat for Food Supply, and\r\nProvincial Councils of National Economy and their sub-divisions.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this decree, the above-mentioned accounts are to be\r\nsettled without the medium of currency, by means of a draft upon the\r\nstate treasury for the amount chargeable to the consuming institution,\r\nand to be credited to the producing institution, or enterprise. In the\r\nstrict sense, the decree establishes a principle, in accordance with\r\nwhich any Soviet institution or governmental enterprise requiring\r\nmerchandise, must not resort to the aid of private dealers, but is in\r\nduty bound to apply to the corresponding Soviet institutions,\r\naccounting, producing or distributing those articles. Thus, it was\r\nproposed, by means of the above-mentioned decree, to reduce an enormous\r\npart of the state budget to the mere calculation of interdepartmental\r\naccounts, income on one side and expenditures on the other. In other\r\nwords, it becomes possible to transact an enormous part of the\r\noperations without the use of money as a medium of exchange.\r\n\r\nAs regards the policy of the Commissariat of Finance in the domain of\r\nthe circulation of money, one of the most important measures in this\r\nrespect was the decree of the Soviet of People’s Commissaries of May\r\n15th, 1919, on the issue of new paper money of the 1918 type.\r\n\r\nThis decree states the following motive for the issue of new money:\r\n“this money is being issued with the object of gradually replacing the\r\npaper money now in circulation of the present model, the form of which\r\nin no way corresponds to the foundations of Russia’s new political\r\norder, and also for the purpose of driving out of circulation various\r\nsubstitutes for money which have been issued due to the shortage of\r\npaper money.”\r\n\r\nThe simultaneous issue of money of the old and new type made it\r\nimpossible for the Commissariat of Finance to immediately commence the\r\nexchange of money, but this in no way did or does prevent it from\r\npreparing the ground for such exchange, in connection with the annulment\r\nof the major part of the old money in a somewhat different manner.\r\nCreating a considerable supply of money of the new model (1918) and\r\nincreasing the productivity of the currency printing office, the\r\nCommissariat is to gradually pass over to, in fact has already begun,\r\nthe issue of money exclusively of the new type. A little while after the\r\nold paper money has ceased to be printed, the laboring population, both\r\nrural and urban, as well as the Red Guards all of whom are not in\r\nposition to accumulate large sums, will soon have none of the old money.\r\nThen will be the time to annul the money of the old type, since this\r\nannulment will not carry with it any serious encroachment on the\r\ninterests of the large laboring masses.\r\n\r\nThus the issue of new money is one of the most needed first steps on the\r\nroad to the preparation of the fundamental problem, that is the\r\nannihilation of a considerable quantity of money of the old type,\r\nreducing in this way the general volume of the mass of paper money in\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nWe thus see that here, too, the Commissariat of Finance followed a\r\ndefinite policy. It goes without saying that from the point of view of\r\nSocialist policy all measures in the domain of money circulation are\r\nmere palliative measures. The Commissariat of Finance entertains no\r\ndoubts as to the fact that a radical solution of the question is\r\npossible only by eliminating money as a medium of exchange.\r\n\r\nThe most immediate problem before the Commissariat of Finance is\r\nundoubtedly the accomplishment of the process which has already begun,\r\nnamely, the selection of the most convenient moment for the annulment of\r\nthe old money. As regards the part which currency generally (at this\r\nmoment of transition) plays, there can be no doubt that now it is the\r\nonly and therefore inevitable system of financing the entire\r\ngovernmental machinery and that the choice of other ways in this\r\ndirection entirely depends upon purely economic conditions, i.e., mainly\r\nupon the process of organization and restoration of the national economy\r\nas a whole.\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nThe explanatory note, attached to the budget for July to December, 1918,\r\nthus depicts our future budget: “When the Socialist reconstruction of\r\nRussia has been completed, when all the factories, mills and other\r\nestablishments have passed into the hands of the government, and the\r\nproducts of these will go to the government freely and directly, when\r\nthe agricultural and farming products will also freely flow into the\r\ngovernment stores either in exchange for manufactured articles or as\r\nduty in kind ... then the state budget will reflect not the condition of\r\nthe monetary transactions of the State Treasury ... but the condition of\r\nthe operations involving material values, belonging to the State, and\r\nthe operations will be transacted without the aid of money, at any rate\r\nwithout money in its present form.”\r\n\r\nIt is clear that at present the conditions are not yet fully prepared\r\nfor the transition to the above-stated new form of state budget. But, in\r\nspite of this, the Commissariat of Finance has taken a big step forward\r\nin the direction of reforming our budget.\r\n\r\nThe budget of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, adopted by\r\nthe All-Russian Central Executive Committee on May 20, 1919, represents\r\nthe experiment in effecting a survey not so much of the financial\r\nactivity of the state, as of its economic activity, even though it is as\r\nyet in the form of money.\r\n\r\nIn the work of reforming the budget, the Commissariat of Finance has\r\ncome across two obstacles which are a heritage of the pre-revolutionary\r\ntime: the division of revenue and expenditures into general state and\r\nlocal, and the hesitation on the part of some to include in the budget\r\nall the productive and distributive operations of the Supreme Council of\r\nNational Economy and of the Commissariat for Food Supply. Both, the\r\nfirst and second obstacles have been somewhat surmounted, and the\r\nabove-mentioned (third) revolutionary budget is already different from\r\nthe two preceding budgets in many peculiarities which are very typical.\r\nThese consist in a complete account of all production and distribution\r\nwhich the state has taken upon itself. This experiment is by no means\r\ncomplete, but the achievement should nevertheless be judged as\r\nconsiderable. The concrete conditions for making out the budget, as is\r\nstated in the explanatory note, have already made it possible to enter\r\nupon the road of accounting for the entire production and distribution\r\nof the nation, and that thereby the foundation has been laid down for\r\nthe development of the budget in the only direction which is proper\r\nunder the present conditions.\r\n\r\nThe budget of the first half of 1919 has followed the same fundamental\r\nprinciples for the construction of the state budget by including the\r\nexpenditures of the entire state production and distribution as well as\r\nthe sum total of the revenue-in the form of income from the productive\r\nand distributive operations of the state. In other words, this budget\r\nfor the first time takes into account all the transactions of the\r\nSupreme Council of National Economy and of the Commissariat for Food\r\nSupply.\r\n\r\nThe further development of the budget will be directed toward the\r\nworking out of the details of this general plan, and, in particular,\r\ntoward differentiating revenue and expenditures: (1) direct, actual\r\nmoney received or paid, and (2) transactions involved in the accounting\r\nof material and labor, but not involving any actual receipts of money,\r\nor requiring any actual disbursements in money.\r\n\r\n                                   VI\r\n\r\nIn the field of taxation one must bear in mind first that the entire\r\nquestion of taxation has been radically changed with the beginning of\r\nCommunist reconstruction.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of the combined measures of economic and financial\r\nlegislation of the Republic, the bases for the levying of land, real\r\nestate, industrial taxes, taxes on coupons, on bank notes, on stock,\r\nstock exchange, etc., completely disappeared, since the objects of\r\ntaxation themselves have become government property. The old statute\r\nregulating the income tax (1916), which has not as yet been abolished,\r\nwas in no way suitable to the changed economic conditions. All this\r\ncompelled the Commissariat of Finance to seek new departures in the\r\nfield of taxation.\r\n\r\nHowever, it was impossible to give up the idea of direct taxation prior\r\nto the complete reformation of the tax system as a whole. Our work of\r\nCommunist reconstruction has not been completed; it would be absurd to\r\nexempt from taxation the former capitalists as well as the newly forming\r\ngroup of people who strive for individual accumulation. This is why the\r\nsystem of direct taxation, which has until recently been in operation,\r\nwas composed of fragments of the old tax on property and of the partly\r\nreformed income tax law. However, beginning with November, 1918, to this\r\nold system there were added two taxes of a purely revolutionary\r\ncharacter which stand out apart within the partly outgrown system “taxes\r\nin kind” (decree of October 30, 1918) and “extraordinary taxes”\r\n(November 2, 1918).\r\n\r\nBoth decrees have been described as follows by Comrade Krestinsky,\r\nCommissary of Finance, at the May session of the financial\r\nsub-divisions:\r\n\r\n“These are decrees of a different order, the only thing they have in\r\ncommon is that they both bear a class character and that each provides\r\nfor the tax to increase in direction proportion with the amount of\r\nproperty which the tax-payer possesses, that the poor are completely\r\nfree from both taxes, and the lower middle class pays them in a smaller\r\nproportion.”\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary tax aims at the savings which remained in the hands of\r\nthe urban and larger rural bourgeoisie from former times. Insofar as it\r\nis directed at non-labor savings it cannot be levied more than once. As\r\nregards the taxes in kind, borrowing Comrade Krestinsky’s expression,\r\n“it will remain in force during the period of transition to the\r\nCommunist order, until the village will from practical experience\r\nrealize the advantage of rural economy on a large scale compared with\r\nthe small farming estate, and will of its own accord, without\r\ncompulsion, _en masse_ adopt the Communist method of land cultivation.”\r\n\r\nThus, the tax in kind is a link binding politically the Communist\r\nsocialized urban economy and the independent individual petty\r\nagricultural producers.\r\n\r\nSuch are the two “direct” revolutionary taxes of the latest period. In\r\nregard to the old system of pre-revolutionary taxes, the work of the\r\nCommissariat of Finance during all of the latest period followed the\r\npath of gradual change and abolition of the already outgrown types of\r\ndirect taxation and partial modification and adaptation to the new\r\nconditions of the moment, of the old taxes still suitable for practical\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment the Commissariat of Finance has entered, in the\r\ndomain of direct taxation reforms, upon the road toward a complete\r\nrevolution in the old system. The central tax board is now, for the\r\ntransitional period, working on a project of income and property\r\ntaxation, the introduction of which will liquidate all the existing\r\ndirect taxes, without exception. The single tax which is being proposed,\r\nis so constructed that it covers the very property of the citizen, i.e.,\r\nit constitutes a demand that the citizen yield that part of his savings\r\nwhich is above a certain standard, etc.\r\n\r\nIn closing the review of the activity of the Commissariat of Finance\r\nduring the two years of its existence, one must note briefly the great\r\npurely organizational work, conducted by it on a natural as well as a\r\nlocal scale.\r\n\r\nThe reform has been definitely directed towards simplifying the\r\napparatus and reducing its personnel as far as possible.\r\n\r\nFinally, with this reform, the Commissariat of Finance has been\r\norganized in the following manner: the central office, the central\r\nbudget-accounting board (former People’s Bank and Department of State\r\nTreasury) and, finally, the central tax board (former Department of\r\nAssessed Taxes and of Unassessed Taxes). Upon the same pattern are also\r\nbeing modeled the local financial bodies.\r\n\r\n                        -----------------------\r\n\r\n                          DOCUMENT IV—A, B, C\r\n\r\n        From _Economic Life_, (Nov. 7, 1919). The official organ\r\n               of the Supreme Council of National Economy\r\n                   Finance, food, trade, and industry\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                          A—OUR METAL INDUSTRY\r\n\r\nThe two years that have passed since the November Revolution have been\r\nmarked by civil war, which still continues. Russia’s isolation from the\r\noutside world, the loss and, later on, the recapture of entire provinces\r\nof decisive importance to her industries, the feverish, and therefore\r\nunsystematic, transfer of the industries to a peace basis, and then,\r\nduring the last year the reorganization of the industries, the unusual\r\nconditions of transportation, the fuel and the food questions, and as a\r\nresult of these, the question of labor power growing more acute—this is\r\nthe sad picture of conditions under which the Russian proletariat has\r\norganized and maintained the nation’s economic life.\r\n\r\nAnd though these familiar conditions of actual life have affected all\r\nbranches of industry, the greatest sufferer in this respect has been the\r\nmetal industry, which forms the basis for our defence and the foundation\r\nfor all our industrial life.\r\n\r\nWe might add here that the metal industry, and in particular the metal\r\nworking industry as its most complicated and many-sided phase, both in\r\nassortment of products and in the nature of production, was by no means\r\nstrong in Russia even under the rule of the bourgeoisie. As compared\r\nwith the more developed capitalist countries, the metal industry in\r\nRussia has been at a disadvantage because of the very geographical\r\nsituation of its centers, remote from the sources of raw material and\r\nfuel, artificially built up and having suffered all the consequences of\r\nan unsound foundation. As a result of these conditions, there is lack of\r\nspecialization and poor development of large scale production which\r\nmeans a lack of the necessary prerequisites for successful production.\r\n\r\nThese are the external conditions under which the administration of our\r\nmetal industry has been compelled to work.\r\n\r\nThe first and most fundamental problem has been that of systematic\r\nmonopolization of industry. Only under this form of industrial\r\norganization—if freed from all the negative features of the capitalist\r\ntrust,—is operation possible, even on a reduced scale, so that later on\r\nwe might lay the solid foundations for new constructive work in the\r\norganization of the nation’s economic life of Socialist principles. The\r\nprocess of monopolization may be considered as complete by this time.\r\nLarge associations have been formed, such as the trust of united\r\ngovernment machine shops “Gomza,” amalgamating the largest mills\r\nproducing the means of transportation and machine construction, and the\r\nlarge metallurgical mills, the trust of state copper working factories,\r\nthe trust of government automobile works, the trust of government\r\naviation work, the trust of government wire nail, bolt and nut\r\nfactories, the trust of the Maltzoff Metallurgical mills, the\r\nassociation of the Kaluga metallurgical mills (cast iron, utensils, and\r\nhardware), the trust of the Podolsk mechanical and machine construction\r\nshops the Petrograd mills for heavy production, the Petrograd mills for\r\nmedium machine construction, and the Petrograd mills for heavy output\r\n(production on large scale) are united under individual district\r\nadministration boards.\r\n\r\nNot all the enterprises consolidated within the associations have become\r\nclosely bound up among themselves during this transitional period. In a\r\nmatter of such gigantic proportions mistakes have been, of course,\r\ninevitable and they will have to be rectified. However, the results of\r\nthe experience of the last two years are sufficient ground for the claim\r\nthat the working class has solved the problem of consolidating industry.\r\n\r\nThe central administration of the Gomza mills thus characterizes the\r\nsignificance of this consolidation: \"The consolidation of the mills\r\nworking on transportation equipment, working with the metallurgical\r\ngroup makes it possible to utilize most efficiently all the resources\r\navailable, such as fuel, raw material, technical forces, and the\r\nexperience of the various mills with a view to obtaining the best\r\npossible results under the existing conditions. The amalgamation of the\r\nmills has already, during the past year, made it possible to distribute\r\namong them in the most rational manner, that inconsiderable quantity of\r\nmetal products and mineral fuel, all products included, which the groups\r\nhad in its possession. This enabled the mills to adapt themselves to the\r\nusage of local fuel. The concentration, even though only partial, of\r\nsome of the branches of the metallurgical industry, also of the\r\nblacksmithing and iron foundry branches, was made possible entirely by\r\nthe amalgamation. The specialization of the mills, according to the\r\ntypes of steam engines, Diesel or other machines, has been decided along\r\ngeneral lines, by the Metal Department of the Supreme Council of\r\nNational Economy, and the question is being worked out in closest\r\ncooperation with the Technical Department of the “Gomza.” The\r\namalgamation of the mills will make it possible to carry out gradually\r\nthis specialization and utilize its results.\r\n\r\nThe central administration of the united mills states, in a report of\r\nits activities, that owing to the consolidation of the mills, the\r\nproblems of supplying them with raw material, fuel and labor power, were\r\nsolved in a fairly satisfactory way, thus placing production on a more\r\nor less constant basis. The mills entering this combination, if left to\r\ntheir own resources, would have been doomed to a complete shutdown.\r\n\r\nThe trust of the airplane building works has so completely amalgamated\r\nall the mills, which entered the combination that it now would be at a\r\nloss to determine in advance which of the mills would perform any given\r\npart of its program of production; to such an extent are these mills\r\nbound up together through constant interchange of fuel, raw material,\r\nsupplies and even labor power.\r\n\r\nThe process of concentration of the industries in the Ural region is\r\nbeing successfully carried out by the Bureau of the Metal Department,\r\nthrough the organization of district and circuit officers.\r\n\r\nOutside of the combine only those mills remained where production is\r\nmerely organized: the Moscow works “Metal,” “Electrosteel,” “Scythe,”\r\n“Aviation Outfits,” and the Satatov mill—“Star” (Zwezda). These works\r\nare temporarily in the immediate charge of the Metal Department.\r\n\r\nThe Gomza trust during the entire period of its existence, up to July\r\n1st, 1919, has produced 69 new locomotives and repaired 38 old ones; it\r\nhas produced 1,744 new and repaired 1,040 old coaches; it has completed\r\n670 small cars; 261,327 poods of axles and tires; 7,543 poods of\r\nswitches; and 118,659 poods of various locomotive and car parts. The\r\ntable given below representing the output for the first six months of\r\n1919, as compared with the same period for 1916 and 1918, of the Vyxunsk\r\nMining District, gives an idea of the work of the Department of\r\nMetallurgy of our largest trust:\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n                 Output in Thousands of Poods            Ratio\r\n\r\n                   I      II      III     IV       IV:I   IV:II  IV:III\r\n\r\n                January January July January\r\n                  to      to      to      to\r\n                 June,   June,   Dec.,   June,\r\n                 1916    1918    1918    1919\r\n\r\n                 ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------\r\n\r\n Standard bars     86,7    91,4    74,2   133,6     154   146,1   179,9\r\n\r\n Roofing iron\r\n   and billets      ...     ...    37,3    37,3     ...      ..   100,0\r\n\r\n Sheet iron and\r\n     boiler\r\n   plates         112,1    59,3     3,5    10,9     9,7    18,4   321,1\r\n\r\n Plough shares\r\n   and\r\n   mould-boards     ...     ...     ...     7,7     ...     ...     ...\r\n\r\n Pipes            225,4   125,0    56,4    61,1    24,7    78,8   108,2\r\n\r\n Wire             255,2   106,7     4,9    22,6     8,8    21,2   455,1\r\n\r\n Nails            114,9   117,4    79,3    51,4    44,8    43,8    64,9\r\n\r\n Pitchforks         ...     2,8     3,7     1,0     ...    36,6    27,2\r\n\r\n Shovels            6,6     6,0     4,5     2,2    33,7    37,3    50,5\r\n\r\n                 ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------  ------\r\n\r\n                  800,9   508,6   263,8   327,8   40,9%    64,5   124,2\r\n\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from the data given in the above table that the total\r\noutput for the first six months of 1919 was almost 41 per cent of the\r\ntotal output for the corresponding period of 1916, and 64.5 per cent of\r\nthe total product for the first half year of 1918, and 124.2 per cent of\r\nthe last six months of 1918. The figures expressing the ratio of the\r\ntotal output of metal for the same periods are respectively—91.4 per\r\ncent, 120.6 per cent and 153.2 per cent.\r\n\r\nTaking into consideration the extremely difficult conditions of\r\nproduction, the results may be considered satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIf we turn to the production of another of our trusts—“Central Copper\r\nWorks” (Centromed), we note that during the period of October to\r\nDecember, 1916, the main Tula factory has produced 73.4 per cent of its\r\ncapacity, during January to June of 1919—89.9 per cent, and finally\r\nduring July and August of this year (1919)—about 87 per cent. The\r\nKolchugin works have produced the various articles of their manufacture\r\nduring the same periods in quantities which amounted to from 16 to 48\r\nper cent, 30 per cent to 77 per cent and 20 per cent to 36 per cent of\r\nthe quantities it was scheduled to produce, while the samovar factories\r\nhave produced 44 per cent of the scheduled output.\r\n\r\nThe mills entering the association of the Central Aviation Works have\r\nproduced 36 per cent to 180 per cent of the quantity they planned to\r\nturn out, while during July, August and September of 1918 this\r\npercentage ranged in the various mills and branches of production from\r\n26 per cent to 120 per cent.\r\n\r\nA comparatively considerable increase of production has been noted on\r\nthe works combined in the automobile trust\r\n\r\nIt would be absolutely impossible, within the limits of a newspaper\r\narticle, to amplify the illustration of the above statements by means of\r\nstatistical data, especially in view of the fact that the data\r\npertaining to the latest period has not been arranged systematically.\r\nHowever, the figures cited above, we trust, give some idea of the\r\nprocess and results of the concentration of industry and permit the\r\ndeduction that the productivity of labor in our large works, insofar as\r\nit did not completely depend upon conditions which under the present\r\ncircumstances are insuperable,—has increased as compared with that for\r\nthe preceding year, and in some exceptional cases, it has even arisen to\r\nthe pre-war level.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our large industry has been getting into even greater\r\ndifficulties. A number of crises weighing on it are breaking down its\r\nlast forces. Of these the most acute and serious are the fuel and food\r\ncrises, the latter demoralizing labor. This enforced comparative\r\nidleness has been thoroughly utilized during the revolutionary period,\r\nfor the purpose of preparing for the time when the external conditions\r\nwould permit our large industries to run at full speed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the work of adapting our industry to modern conditions of\r\nproduction (altering the mills to suit them to the usage of wood fuel,\r\nby changing the construction of the furnaces and cupolas) the Technical\r\nCouncil of the Metals Department of the Supreme Council of National\r\nEconomy is conducting the enormous work of standardizing the industry\r\nand specializing the mills by means of a detailed study of the\r\nindividual branches of industry. It is also engaged in the restoration\r\nof the old, and in the organization of new, industries on the basis of\r\nspecialized labor and production on a large scale. This latter task has\r\nbeen carried out by a number of commissions organized by the Metal\r\nDepartment of the Supreme Council of National Economy.\r\n\r\nThe Technical Council of the Metals Department conducted its work\r\nchiefly on the plane of standardizing production within the metal\r\nindustry, reducing to a minimum the types of construction of the same\r\narticle. Under capitalist conditions of production the law of\r\ncompetition frequently led individual manufacturers to deliberately\r\nflood the market with a multitude of various constructions of the same\r\nmachines in order to compel the consumer purchasing a machine or\r\nimplement at a given mill, to buy all the parts and often have his\r\nmachine repaired in the same shop. It is needless to point out to what\r\nextent this increased the cost of production and, what is still more\r\nimportant, the cost of exploitation. The Technical Council has tackled\r\nthe question not from an abstractly scientific viewpoint, but from a\r\npractical standpoint, working in close cooperation with our metal works.\r\nEvery master part, every detail is being worked out on the basis of data\r\ncollected at the mills by subcommittees consisting of specialists. Then\r\nthe project is submitted to the mills where the necessary changes and\r\ncoordination are suggested. The comments given by the mills are compiled\r\nand revised, before this or the other table or drawing is introduced;\r\nthe same applies to the technical specifications and assortments.\r\n\r\nMaster parts of three categories are being worked out: (1) for the\r\nproduction of metal ware on a large scale, (2) for general machine\r\nconstruction, (3) for the construction of Diesel engines, which is now\r\ndeveloping into a general division of thermo-technics.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, a project is being completed for a lathe designed\r\nfor the needs of home industries, and for repair work. A project is\r\nbeing worked out for a series of lathes of all sizes, required for\r\nmachine construction shops.\r\n\r\nBesides work on the standardization of industry, efforts are also being\r\nmade to lay down the technical conditions.\r\n\r\nOf the above mentioned committees, the following deserve special\r\nmention:\r\n\r\n(1) The committee on steam turbine construction is distributing orders\r\nfor the construction of turbines of various types. The Petrograd metal\r\nworks and the Putiloff wharf have already completed part of their\r\norders. In addition to this, the committee has investigated the\r\nconstruction of steam turbines in Russia.\r\n\r\n(2) The committee on tractor construction has redistributed and again\r\nalloted orders among the Obukhov factory, the Mamin mill and the\r\nKolomenksky mill for 75, 16 and 30 horse-power tractors. The drawings\r\nfor the latter type of tractor have been worked out by the committee.\r\nOut of the number of tractors ordered at the Obukhov works, the first\r\nthree Russian-made tractors are already completed. The others will be\r\nturned out in January and in June of 1920. It is proposed to organize\r\nthe production of tractors on a large scale at the new Vyxunsk mill, the\r\nbuilding of which is being completed.\r\n\r\n(3) The committee on the construction of gas generating installations\r\nwhich has determined the basic type of gas generating engine most\r\nsuitable for the conditions of Russian machine construction, has\r\nstandardized the normal power of the engines; it has also outlined the\r\npreliminary measures for the adaptation of certain mills to large scale\r\nproduction of gas-generating engines.\r\n\r\n(4) The committee for the development and improvement of steam boiler\r\nconstruction in Russia, has prepared the material and worked out\r\ndetailed conditions for a contest of stationary water-tube boilers, the\r\ncheapest as to cost of production and the most economical in operation\r\nto be adopted by the committee. The committee also prepares the\r\nconditions for a contest on the production of a mechanical stoker,\r\nhaving investigated possible productivity and modern methods of\r\nproduction of steam boilers in Russia.\r\n\r\n(5) The committee on the construction of refrigerating machinery\r\nascertained the requirements for 1919–1920 in the line of refrigerating\r\nmachinery; it is laying down and determining the types of refrigerating\r\nmachines and apparatus that would be most desirable; it is working out\r\nthe construction of the same, etc. Finally, it has drawn up plans for\r\nthe construction of refrigerator-barges to sail regularly on the Volga\r\nbetween Astrakhan and Rybinsk.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-mentioned commissions, the Metal Department has\r\na number of committees now functioning, such as the committee in charge\r\nof supplying the country with high grades of steel, having a technical\r\nconvention of its own the committee on the organization of the Ural\r\nindustries, the committee on locomotive construction, etc.\r\n\r\nAs we have mentioned before, simultaneously with rendering support to\r\nlarge industries and taking steps for their conversion to normal\r\nconditions, particularly careful attention had to be given to the\r\nintermediate, small and home industries.\r\n\r\nIntermediate industry comprises almost all of the agricultural machine\r\nconstruction, under the direction of the agricultural machinery section\r\nof the Metal Department of the Supreme Council of National Economy. This\r\nsection operates in close contact with the local governing bodies in\r\ncharge of the people’s industries: provincial, councils of national\r\neconomy. According to the data of the section, covering the period of\r\nOctober 1st, 1918 to October 1st, 1919, the following simple as well as\r\ncomplicated agricultural machines and implements have been produced:\r\n\r\n          147,453 ploughs\r\n            3,717 winnowing machines\r\n            1,440 straw cutters\r\n           11,451 harrows\r\n           98,689 scythes\r\n          684,420 sickles\r\n           11,980 harvesting machines\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of organizing the production of scythes in the most\r\nefficient manner possible the agricultural machine section created a\r\nspecial Scythes Bureau, which is investigating this line of production,\r\nascertaining the possible amount of productivity if manufactured in the\r\nmachine shop manner or according to the home industry method, both in\r\nthe central provinces and in the Ural region. The bureau has laid down a\r\nplan for radical change in the nature of production by means of\r\nsplitting it into two fundamental processes: the metallurgical—the\r\nrolling of steel of worked out profile; and the finishing process in the\r\nmills and shops. For the purpose of rolling the metal it has been\r\nproposed to utilize the Vyxunsk mill, which has been requested to\r\ninclude in its program the rolling of steel for the production of\r\nscythes.\r\n\r\nIn the field of home industry production on a small scale the committee\r\non metal products and apparatus of the Metal Department is working in\r\nclose cooperation with other government institutions, having organized\r\nagencies in Pavlovsk, Tula, Murom, and Vladimir, for the purpose of\r\nfinancing artisans and distributing raw material among them on the one\r\ncondition that they turn in their product to the government stores for\r\norganized distribution. The results of this work can be judged by the\r\nfollowing approximate data on the cost of manufactured products, the\r\nstock on hand from previous year returned to the factories and\r\nenterprises of the Murom, Pavlovsk, Tula region, as well as to the group\r\nof cast iron foundries of the provinces of Kaluga and Ryazan.\r\n\r\nThe Murom district, manufacturing cutlery and to some extent also\r\ninstruments, has turned out, during the period following the\r\norganization of the government agency, 15 million roubles’ worth of\r\ngoods, while the total worth of it, including remnants returned, amounts\r\nto 25 million roubles; the Pavlovsk district engaged in the manufacture\r\nof cutlery, locks and instruments,—among others, surgical\r\ninstruments—has produced since October 1st, 1918, 70 million roubles’\r\nworth of merchandise; including the remnants, this would aggregate to\r\n100 million roubles. The Tula district (hardware, locks, stove\r\naccessories, samovars, hunters’ rifles), has produced since May 1919, 30\r\nmillion roubles’ worth of goods, which, including the remnants, amount\r\nto 60 million roubles. The cast-iron foundries of the Kaluga and Ryazan\r\ndistricts (manufacturing cast-iron utensils, stove accessories and\r\nvarious other castings) have produced since October 1st, 1918, 50\r\nmillion roubles’ worth of merchandise, including the remnants.\r\n\r\nThus, the total amount of goods produced amounts to 165 million\r\nroubles,—or to 235 million roubles, if the value of the remnants is\r\nadded,—taking 40 as the co-efficient of its value according to\r\npeace-time prices.\r\n\r\nThe central administration could not take upon itself the direct\r\norganization of home industries to the full extent. Its best assistants\r\nin this matter are the local institutions of national economy—the\r\nprovincial and district metal committees, which have been brought in\r\nclose contact with the central administration by the conventions of the\r\nrepresentatives of the district and provincial metal committees. These\r\nconventions were being called at regular intervals for the purpose of\r\nworking out and ratifying their programs concerning production and\r\ndistribution of metals, and financial questions.\r\n\r\nWe must also mention the fact that all the measures in the domain of the\r\nmetal industry are being carried out with the close and immediate\r\ncooperation of the workers’ producing association—the union of metal\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nThus, as has been proven from practical experience, the methods and\r\nforms of organization of the metal industry have turned out to be\r\ncorrect. Their application is therefore to be continued and widened,\r\nstrengthening the ties binding these organizations with the local\r\nadministrative bodies, such as the provincial and district metal\r\ncommittees and with the central management of the amalgamated\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nThe great obstacle in the path of future development in our metal\r\nindustry is the food question, which carries with it the dissolution of\r\nlabor power. Considering the fact that circumstances have compelled our\r\nindustry in general, and particularly the metal industry, to supply\r\nchiefly the needs of national defence, to which it is necessary to give\r\nright of way over all other interests, the authorities and the labor\r\norganizations must do everything in their power to avert the food crisis\r\nthreatening the metal workers, even if this be to the detriment of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary not only to cease all further mobilization of laborers\r\nand responsible workers, but also to select a considerable portion of\r\nthose already mobilized for the purpose of transferring them from the\r\narmy into industry.\r\n\r\nThe course of work of the metal industry during the past two years gives\r\nus reason to hope that these measures, if introduced systematically,\r\nmight make it possible to cope with the difficult external conditions\r\nand furnish a mighty stimulus for preparing the metal industry for the\r\nneeds of peaceful construction.\r\n\r\n                                               M. VINDELBOT.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RURAL INDUSTRIES\r\n                 B—FROM “ECONOMIC LIFE,” Nov. 7, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Council of National Economy has put into practice the idea\r\nof nationalization of all our industries: at present there is not one\r\nmill or factory of any considerable size that is not the property of the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nDuring the second year of its existence, the Supreme Council of National\r\nEconomy has made some headway in the work of nationalization of land. As\r\na particular instance we might cite the fact that it was upon the\r\ninitiative and due to the energetic efforts of the Supreme Council of\r\nNational Economy that the land fund for the sugar industry has been\r\nnationalized. The total area of land nationalized for the sugar industry\r\namounts to 600,000 dessiatins.\r\n\r\nThe sugar-beet industry has furnished the initial step in the\r\ndevelopment of the rural industries, since this particular industry has\r\nbeen better preserved during the transitional period of the Revolution.\r\nThe alcohol industry occupies the next place. Its development has been\r\nbegun by the Supreme Council of National Economy during the last few\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThese two large branches of rural industry are followed by a number of\r\nlesser significance, such as the production of starch, molasses, butter,\r\nmilk, tobacco, medicinal herbs, the group of fibre plants, etc. The\r\nSupreme Council of National Economy is now laying a solid foundation for\r\nthe development of all these industries.\r\n\r\nWhat then is the program of action of the Supreme Council of National\r\nEconomy for the development of the rural industries? In the first place,\r\nto supply definite land areas for the cultivation of certain plants, the\r\nintroduction of definite forms of agricultural labor, and of uniform\r\nmanagement for the manufacturing and agricultural industries, the\r\nestablishment of close connections between the industrial proletariat\r\nand the citizens engaged in the rural industries.\r\n\r\nAmong the problems enumerated above, foremost is that of uniting the\r\nindustrial proletariat with the rural workers. The Supreme Council of\r\nNational Economy has already begun to work on this task. Thus the\r\nindustrial proletariat is now officially in possession of 90,000\r\ndessiatins of land, on which communes have been organized. The crops\r\nfrom these estates go to satisfy the needs of the associations in whose\r\nname the estates are registered. At the same time, the industrial\r\nproletariat, through participation in agricultural labor, is introducing\r\nnew ideas into the rural industries.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Council of National Economy is mining the coal from the\r\ndepths of the earth and exploiting the peat deposits. In order to\r\nutilize the resources completely, it is paying particular attention to\r\nthe conversion of swampy areas and exhausted turf deposits into areable\r\nland, transforming the bottom of the exploited turf areas into vegetable\r\ngardens, the sections bordering upon the swamps into artificial meadows,\r\nand the uplands into fields. During last summer similar work was\r\naccomplished on a considerable scale on the lands of the central\r\nelectric station, in the Government of Moscow, the Ilatur electric\r\nstation, in the Government of Ryazan, Gus-Hrustalny, in the Government\r\nof Vladimir, and the Gomza estates in the Government of Nizhni-Novgorod.\r\nThus, during last summer, the work was organized in four central\r\nprovinces, abounding in large areas of land, which cannot be\r\nconveniently used for agricultural purposes.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously the improvement of dwellings, and the building of\r\ngarden-cities is being given careful and immediate consideration. This\r\nwork is being carried on by the Supreme Council of National Economy at\r\nthe electric station of Kashirsk, the Shatur station and the Central\r\nElectric station.\r\n\r\nIn order to unify rural industries the Supreme Council of National\r\nEconomy has formed the central administration of agricultural estates\r\nand industrial enterprises, assigning to it the task of uniting and\r\ndeveloping as far as possible, the work of the rural mills.\r\n\r\nThe Central Administration of Agriculture considers it one of its\r\nimmediate problems to propagate widely the idea of nationalization of\r\nland for all rural industries and the opening of new districts for those\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nIn apportioning the land, especially valuable districts should be set\r\napart, such as the meadows, flooded with water from the Don river, fully\r\nsuitable for the cultivation of tobacco, fibre plants, and olives, on a\r\nlarge scale.\r\n\r\nThese lands, if distributed among the peasants will never yield such\r\nwealth as they could do were they nationalized for rational\r\nexploitation.\r\n\r\nNext on the program of the Central Administration of Agriculture is the\r\nbuilding up of new branches of rural industry, such as the working of\r\nsugar beets into molasses and into beet flour, in the northern\r\ndistricts, the production of ammonium sulphate out of the lower grades\r\nof peat, the preparation of fodder out of animal refuse, the production\r\nof turf litter material, the preparation of new sources of nitrate\r\nfertilizer out of peat, etc.\r\n\r\nElectric power must be utilized for the cultivation of land. The\r\npractical realization of this problem has been started on the fields of\r\nthe electric power transmission department. This Fall we succeeded in\r\ntilling the ground by means of a power-driven plow.\r\n\r\nIn order to build up the rural industries, practical work must be\r\ncarried on, simultaneously with that which is being done on the\r\nparticularly important lands, also on such lands as will not be the bone\r\nof contention between the proletariat and the peasantry.\r\n\r\nWhat lands are these? The swampy areas, the forest-covered lands, those\r\ndistricts where the people are starving, the dry lands, the scarcely\r\npopulated districts, etc.\r\n\r\nThese are the brief outlines of the program. The foundations of\r\nabsolutely all of the development of rural industry mentioned have been\r\nlaid down. The practical steps for the materialization of the plans have\r\nto some extent already been, or are being, undertaken.\r\n\r\nAll of this work the Supreme Council of National Economy had to carry\r\nout under extremely difficult conditions. Prior to that, a considerable\r\npart of the sources of raw material for the rural industries has been\r\ncompletely torn away from the Soviet Republic. Another serious hindrance\r\nwas the insufficient number of already existing organizations, which\r\nwould be capable of fulfilling the tasks outlined by the Council. A\r\nconsiderable amount of harm has been done to this work by\r\ninterdepartmental friction.\r\n\r\nBut difficult as the present conditions may be, and no matter how strong\r\nis the desire of the former ruling classes to turn back the tide of\r\nlife, this is impossible and can never take place.\r\n\r\n                                CENTRAL ADMINISTRATION OF AGRICULTURE.\r\n\r\n                           ------------------\r\n\r\n                     NATIONALIZATION OF AGRICULTURE\r\n                 C—FROM “ECONOMIC LIFE,” Nov. 7, 1919.\r\n\r\nThe nationalization of agriculture is one of the most complicated\r\nproblems of the Socialist Revolution, and perhaps in no other country is\r\nthis problem as complex as in Soviet Russia.\r\n\r\nAt the time when the decree on Socialist land management was made\r\npublic, the fundamental elements of nationalization had hardly begun to\r\ntake shape: the territory affected by nationalization was by no means\r\ndefined; there was not the personnel necessary for the creation and\r\nenforcement of any plan concerning production; the large masses of\r\nlaborers hardly understood the idea of nationalization and in some\r\ninstances were hostile to the measures by means of which the Soviet\r\npower was carrying out the program of nationalization.\r\n\r\nIn order to summarize the results of the work, which began on a\r\nnation-wide scale in March, 1919, and to estimate these results, one\r\nmust first realize the conditions which formed the starting-point for\r\nthe work of the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture at the time when it\r\ncommenced to carry out the nationalization of agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe extent of the capitalist heritage, which our organized Soviet\r\nestates now have at their disposal, amounts to 615,503 dessiatins or\r\nareable land, situated in the Soviet provinces and formerly in the hands\r\nof private owners. Eighty-five per cent of the areable land, which\r\nformerly belonged to the landed aristocracy was taken over for the\r\npurpose of both organized and non-organized distribution—chiefly the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\nThe equipment of the various estates was diminished and destroyed to no\r\nlesser extent. Instead of the 386,672 privately owned horses, registered\r\nin the Soviet provinces, according to the census of 1916, the Soviet\r\nestates in the hands of the People’s Commissariat of Agriculture\r\nreceived 23,149 horses—a number hardly sufficient for the cultivation of\r\none-third of the area under cultivation now belonging to the Soviet\r\nestates. Of the 290,969 cows—only 43,361 came into the possession of the\r\nSoviet estates. The entire number of horses and cows will yield\r\nsufficient fertilizer for only 13,000 dessiatins of fallow land, i.e.,\r\nabout 10 per cent of the area intended to be converted into areable\r\nland.\r\n\r\nThe supply of agricultural machinery and implements was in the same\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet estates had almost no stocks of provisions. The workmen were\r\ncompelled either to steal or to desert for places where bread was more\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThe winter corn was sowed in the fall of 1918 on very limited areas (not\r\nover 25 per cent of the fallow land), very often without fertilizer,\r\nwith a very small quantity of seeds to each dessiatin. In 13 out of 36\r\nSoviet provinces (governments) no winter corn has been sowed at all.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the estates taken over by the People’s\r\nCommissariat of Agriculture could not be utilized due to the lack of\r\nvarious accessories, such as harness, horseshoes, rope, small\r\ninstruments, etc.\r\n\r\nThe workers were fluctuating, entirely unorganized, politically\r\ninert—due to the shortage of provisioning and of organization. The\r\ntechnical forces could not get used to the village; besides, we did not\r\nhave sufficient numbers of agricultural experts familiar with the\r\npractical organization of large estates. The regulations governing the\r\nsocial management of land charged the representatives of the industrial\r\nproletariat with a leading part in the work of the Soviet estates. But\r\ntorn between meeting the various requirements of the Republic of prime\r\nimportance, the proletariat could not with sufficient speed furnish the\r\nnumber of organizers necessary for agricultural management.\r\n\r\nThe idea of centralized management on the Soviet estates has not been\r\nproperly understood by the local authorities, and the work of\r\norganization from the very beginning had to progress amidst bitter\r\nfighting between the provincial Soviet estates and the provincial\r\noffices of the Department of Agriculture. This struggle has not yet\r\nceased.\r\n\r\nThus, the work of nationalizing the country’s agriculture began in the\r\nspring, i.e., a half year later than it should have, and without any\r\ndefinite territory (every inch of it had to be taken after a long and\r\nstrenuous siege on the part of the surrounding population), with\r\ninsufficient and semi-ruined equipment, without provisions, without an\r\napparatus for organization and without the necessary experience for such\r\nwork, with the agricultural workers engaged in the Soviet estates having\r\nno organization at all.\r\n\r\nAccording to our preliminary calculations, we are to gather in the Fall\r\nof this year a crop of produce totaling in the 2,524 Soviet estates as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                                              Area in\r\n                                                Poods      Dessiatins\r\n\r\n  Winter crop                               1,798,711          54,000\r\n\r\n  Spring corn                               4,765,790          97,720\r\n\r\n  Potatoes                                 16,754,900          23,754\r\n\r\n  Vegetables, approximately                 4,500,000           4,659\r\n\r\nOf the Winter corn we received only a little over what was required for\r\nseed (in a number of provinces the crops are insufficient for the\r\nconsumption of the workers of the Soviet estates).\r\n\r\nThe Soviet estates are almost everywhere sufficiently supplied with\r\nseeds for the spring crops.\r\n\r\nThe number of horses used on the Soviet estates has been increased\r\nthrough the additional purchase of 12,000 to 15,000.\r\n\r\nThe number of cattle has also been somewhat increased.\r\n\r\nThe Soviet estates are almost completely supplied with agricultural\r\nimplements and accessories, both by having procured new outfits from the\r\nPeople’s Commissariat for Provisioning and by means of energetic repair\r\nwork on the old ones.\r\n\r\nThe foundation has been laid (in one-half of the provinces sufficiently\r\nstable foundations) for the formation of an organizational machinery for\r\nthe administration of the Soviet estates.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the Soviet estates the labor union of the\r\nagricultural proletariat has developed into a large organization.\r\n\r\nIn a number of provinces the leading part in the work of the Soviet\r\nestates has been practically assumed by the industrial proletariat,\r\nwhich has furnished a number of organizers, whose reputation had been\r\nsufficiently established.\r\n\r\nEstimating the results of the work accomplished, we must admit that we\r\nhave not as yet any fully nationalized rural economy. But during the\r\neight months of work in this direction, all the elements for its\r\norganization have been accumulated.\r\n\r\nWe have strengthened our position in regard to supplies, having been\r\nenabled not only to equip more efficiently the Soviet estates (2,524)\r\nalready included in our system of organization, but also to nationalize\r\nduring the season of 1920 additional 1,012 Soviet estates, with an area\r\nof 972,674 dessiatins. The combined area of the nationalized enterprises\r\nwill probably amount in 1920 to about 2,000,000 dessiatins within the\r\npresent Soviet territory.\r\n\r\nA preliminary familiarity with individual estates and with agricultural\r\nregions makes it possible to begin the preparation of a national plan\r\nfor production on the Soviet estates and for a systematic attempt to\r\nmeet the manifold demands made on the nationalized estates by the\r\nagricultural industries: sugar, distilling, chemical, as well as by the\r\ncountry’s need for stock breeding, seeds, planting and other raw\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulties arise in the creation of the machinery of\r\norganization. The shortage of agricultural experts is being replenished\r\nwith great difficulty, for the position of the technical personnel of\r\nthe Soviet estates, due to their weak political organization, is\r\nextremely unstable. The mobilization of the proletarian forces for work\r\nin the Soviet estates gives us ground to believe that in this respect\r\nthe spring of 1920 will find us sufficiently prepared.\r\n\r\nThe ranks of proletarian workers in the Soviet estates are drawing\r\ntogether. True, the level of their enlightenment is by no means high,\r\nbut “in union there is strength” and this force, if properly utilized,\r\nwill yield rapidly positive results.\r\n\r\nIn order to complete the picture of the agricultural work for the past\r\nyear we are citing the following figures: the total expenditures\r\nincurred on the Soviet estates and on account of their administration up\r\nto January 1st, 1920, is estimated to amount to 924,347,500 roubles. The\r\nincome, if the products of the Soviet estates are considered at firm\r\nprices, amounts to 843,372,343 roubles.\r\n\r\nThus, the first, the most difficult year, has ended without a deficit,\r\nif one excludes a part of the liabilities which are to be met during a\r\nnumber of years, i.e., horses and implements.\r\n\r\nOf course, it is not the particular experience which the workers possess\r\nthat has caused the favorable balance of the Soviet estates, this being\r\nmainly due to the fact that the productive work in the realm of\r\nagriculture under modern conditions is a business not liable to lose.\r\n\r\nAnd this is natural: industry in all its forms depends upon the supply\r\nof fuel, raw material, and food. Nationalized rural economy has an\r\ninexhaustible supply of solar energy—a fuel supply independent of\r\ntransportation of the blockade.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental element of production—land—does not demand any\r\n“colonial” means of restoration of its productivity. And as for\r\nprovisions, these we get from the earth under the sun!\r\n\r\nAfter eight months of work on the nationalization of our rural economy,\r\nas a result of two years of titanic struggle on the part of the\r\nproletariat for the right to organize the Socialist industries with its\r\nown hands,—is it not high time to admit that the most expedient, most\r\nfar-sighted, and correct method to stabilize the Soviet power would be\r\nto use the greatest number of organized proletarian forces for the work\r\nof nationalizing our agriculture?\r\n\r\n                                                      N.
