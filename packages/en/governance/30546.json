From\r\nthis point of view the most fruitful years of his life were spent\r\nbetween the time when the _Globe_ was established to advocate\r\nresponsible government, and the time when the provinces were\r\nconfederated and the bounds of Canada extended from the Atlantic to\r\nthe Pacific. The ordinary political contests in which Mr. Brown and\r\nhis newspaper engaged have received only casual notice, and the effort\r\nof the writer has been to trace Mr. Brown's connection with the stream\r\nof events by which the old legislative union of Canada gave place to\r\nthe confederated Dominion.\r\n\r\nAfter the establishment of responsible government, the course of this\r\nstream is not obscure. Brown is found complaining that Upper Canada is\r\ninadequately represented and is dominated by its partner. Various\r\nremedies, such as dissolution of the union, representation by\r\npopulation and the \"double majority,\" are proposed; but ultimately the\r\nsolution is found in federation, and to this solution, and the events\r\nleading up to it, a large part of the book is devoted. Mr. Brown was\r\nalso an ardent advocate of the union with Canada of the country lying\r\nwest to the Rocky Mountains, and to this work reference is made.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was one of those men who arouse strong friendships and\r\nstrong animosities. These have been dealt with only where they seemed\r\nto have a bearing upon history, as in the case of Sir John A.\r\nMacdonald and of the Roman Catholic Church. It seems to be a\r\nprofitless task for a biographer to take up and fight over again\r\nquarrels which had no public importance and did not affect the course\r\nof history.\r\n\r\nThe period covering Mr. Brown's career was one in which the political\r\ngame was played roughly, and in which strong feelings were aroused. To\r\nthis day it is difficult to discuss the career of the Hon. George\r\nBrown, or of Sir John A. Macdonald, without reviving these feelings in\r\nthe breasts of political veterans and their sons; and even one who\r\ntries to study the time and the men and to write their story, finds\r\nhimself taking sides with men who are in their graves, and fighting\r\nfor causes long since lost and won. The writer has tried to resist the\r\ntemptation of building up the fame of Brown by detracting from that of\r\nother men, but he has also thought it right in many cases to present\r\nBrown's point of view, not necessarily as the whole truth, but as one\r\nof the aspects of truth.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the question of confederation, my endeavour has been\r\nsimply to tell the story of Brown's work and let it speak for itself,\r\nnot to measure the exact proportion of credit due to Brown and to\r\nothers. It is hard to believe, however, that the verdict of history\r\nwill assign to him a place other than first among the public men of\r\nCanada who contributed to the work of confederation. Events, as D'Arcy\r\nMcGee said, were probably more powerful than any of them.\r\n\r\nIf any apology is needed for the space devoted to the subject of\r\nslavery in the United States, it may be found not only in Brown's\r\nlife-long opposition to slavery, but in the fact that the Civil War\r\ninfluenced the relations between the United States and Canada, and\r\nindirectly promoted the confederation of the Canadian provinces, and\r\nalso in the fact, so frequently emphasized by Mr. Brown, that the\r\ngrowth of the institution of slavery on this continent was a danger to\r\nwhich Canada could not be indifferent.\r\n\r\nAmong the works that have been found useful for reference are John\r\nCharles Dent's _Last Forty Years_ (Canada since the union of 1841);\r\n_Gray on Confederation_; Coté's _Political Appointments and Elections\r\nin the Province of Canada_; Dr. Hodgins' _Legislation and History of\r\nSeparate Schools in Upper Canada_; the lives of _Lord Elgin_, _Dr.\r\nRyerson_ and _Joseph Howe_ in \"The Makers of Canada\" series; the Hon.\r\nAlexander Mackenzie's _Life and Speeches of the Hon. George Brown_;\r\nthe Hon. James Young's _Public Men and Public Life in Canada_. Mr.\r\nMackenzie's book contains a valuable collection of letters, to which\r\nfrequent reference is made in the chapters of this book dealing with\r\nconfederation. The account of the relations of the Peel government\r\nwith Governor Sir Charles Bagot is taken from the _Life of Sir Robert\r\nPeel_, from his correspondence, edited by C. S. Parker. The files of\r\nthe _Banner_ and the _Globe_ have been read with some care; they were\r\nfound to contain an embarrassing wealth of most interesting historical\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nTo Dr. James Bain, Librarian of the Toronto Free Library, and to Mr.\r\nAvern Pardoe, of the Library of the Legislative Assembly, I am deeply\r\nindebted for courtesy and assistance.\r\n\r\nJOHN LEWIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER I_                                    Page\r\n\r\n  FROM SCOTLAND TO CANADA                         1\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER II_\r\n\r\n  METCALFE AND HIS REFORMERS                     11\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER III_\r\n\r\n  RESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT                         31\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IV_\r\n\r\n  DISSENSION AMONG REFORMERS                     39\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER V_\r\n\r\n  THE CLERGY RESERVES                            51\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VI_\r\n\r\n  BROWN'S FIRST PARLIAMENT                       61\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VII_\r\n\r\n  RISE OF BROWN'S INFLUENCE                      69\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER VIII_\r\n\r\n  RECONSTRUCTION OF PARTIES                      77\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER IX_\r\n\r\n  SOME PERSONAL POLITICS                         87\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER X_\r\n\r\n  THE \"DOUBLE SHUFFLE\"                           99\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XI_\r\n\r\n  AGAINST AMERICAN SLAVERY                      111\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XII_\r\n\r\n  BROWN AND THE ROMAN CATHOLICS                 121\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIII_\r\n\r\n  MOVING TOWARDS CONFEDERATION                  129\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIV_\r\n\r\n  LAST YEARS OF THE UNION                       141\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XV_\r\n\r\n  CONFEDERATION                                 147\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVI_\r\n\r\n  THE QUEBEC CONFERENCE                         163\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVII_\r\n\r\n  THE CONFEDERATION DEBATE                      169\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XVIII_\r\n\r\n  THE MISSION TO ENGLAND                        181\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XIX_\r\n\r\n  BROWN LEAVES THE COALITION                    189\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XX_\r\n\r\n  CONFEDERATION AND THE PARTIES                 199\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXI_\r\n\r\n  CANADA AND THE GREAT WEST                     211\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXII_\r\n\r\n  THE RECIPROCITY TREATY OF 1874                223\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXIII_\r\n\r\n  CANADIAN NATIONALISM                          235\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXIV_\r\n\r\n  LATER YEARS                                   243\r\n\r\n\r\n_CHAPTER XXV_\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION                                    255\r\n\r\n  INDEX                                         269\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nFROM SCOTLAND TO CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge Brown was born at Alloa, a seaport on the tidal Forth,\r\nthirty-five miles inward from Edinburgh, on November 29th, 1818. His\r\nmother was a daughter of George Mackenzie, of Stornoway, in the Island\r\nof Lewis. His father, Peter Brown, was a merchant and builder. George\r\nwas educated at the High School and Southern Academy in Edinburgh.\r\n\"This young man,\" said Dr. Gunn, of the Southern Academy, \"is not only\r\nendowed with high enthusiasm, but possesses the faculty of creating\r\nenthusiasm in others.\" At the risk of attaching too much significance\r\nto praise bestowed on a school-boy, it may be said that these words\r\nstruck the keynote of Brown's character and revealed the source of his\r\npower. The atmosphere of the household was Liberal; father and son\r\nalike hated the institution of slavery, with which they were destined\r\nto become more closely acquainted. \"When I was a very young man,\" said\r\nGeorge Brown, denouncing the Fugitive Slave Law before a Toronto\r\naudience, \"I used to think that if I ever had to speak before such an\r\naudience as this, I would choose African Slavery as my theme in\r\npreference to any other topic. The subject seemed to afford the\r\nwidest scope for rhetoric and for fervid appeals to the best of human\r\nsympathies. These thoughts arose far from here, while slavery was a\r\nthing at a distance, while the horrors of the system were unrealized,\r\nwhile the mind received it as a tale and discussed it as a principle.\r\nBut, when you have mingled with the thing itself, when you have\r\nencountered the atrocities of the system, when you have seen three\r\nmillions of human beings held as chattels by their Christian\r\ncountrymen, when you have seen the free institutions, the free press\r\nand the free pulpit of America linked in the unrighteous task of\r\nupholding the traffic, when you have realized the manacle, and the\r\nlash, and the sleuth-hound, you think no more of rhetoric, the mind\r\nstands appalled at the monstrous iniquity, mere words lose their\r\nmeaning, and facts, cold facts, are felt to be the only fit\r\narguments.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, as George grew to manhood, the struggle which ended in the\r\ndisruption of the Church of Scotland was approaching its climax, and\r\nthe sympathies of the Brown household were with those who declared\r\nthat it \"is the fundamental law of this Church that no pastor shall be\r\nintruded on any congregation contrary to the will of the people.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1838 reverses in business led the father and son to seek their\r\nfortunes in America. Arriving in New York, Peter Brown turned to\r\njournalism, finding employment as a contributor to the _Albion_, a\r\nweekly newspaper published for British residents of the United\r\nStates. The Browns formed an unfavourable opinion of American\r\ninstitutions as represented by New York in that day. To them the\r\nrepublic presented itself as a slave-holding power, seeking to extend\r\nits territory in order to enlarge the area of slavery, and hostile to\r\nGreat Britain as a citadel of freedom. They always regarded the\r\nslave-holding element in the United States as that which kept up the\r\ntradition of enmity to England. An American book entitled, _The Glory\r\nand Shame of England_, aroused Peter Brown's indignation, and he\r\npublished a reply in a little volume bearing the name of _The Fame and\r\nGlory of England Vindicated_. Here he paid tribute to British freedom,\r\ncontrasted it with the domination of the slave holders, and instanced\r\nthe fact that in Connecticut a woman had been mobbed and imprisoned\r\nfor teaching coloured girls to read. Further light is thrown upon the\r\nAmerican experience of the Browns by an article in the _Banner_, their\r\nfirst Canadian venture in journalism. The writer is answering an\r\naccusation of disloyalty and Yankee sympathies, a stock charge against\r\nReformers in that day. He said: \"We have stood in the very heart of a\r\nrepublic, and fearlessly issued our weekly sheet, expressing our\r\nfervent admiration of the limited monarchy of Great Britain, though\r\nsurrounded by Democratic Whigs, Democratic Republicans, Irish\r\nRepealers, slave-holders, and every class which breathes the most\r\ninveterate hostility to British institutions. And we are not to be\r\nturned from maintaining the genuine principles of the constitution\r\nbecause some of our contemporaries are taken with a fit of sycophancy,\r\nand would sacrifice all at the shrine of power.\"\r\n\r\nIn December, 1842, the Browns established in New York the _British\r\nChronicle_, a paper similar to the _Albion_, but apparently designed\r\nmore especially for Scottish and Presbyterian readers in the United\r\nStates and Canada. In an effort to promote Canadian circulation,\r\nGeorge Brown came to Canada early in 1843. The _Chronicle_ had taken\r\nstrong ground on the popular side of the movement then agitating the\r\nChurch of Scotland; and this struggle was watched with peculiar\r\ninterest in Canada, where the relations between Church and State were\r\nburning questions. Young Brown also met the members of a Reform\r\nadministration then holding power under Governor Metcalfe, and the\r\nministers became impressed with the idea that he would be a powerful\r\nally in the struggle then impending.\r\n\r\nThere is on record an interesting pen picture of George Brown as he\r\nappeared at this time. The writer is Samuel Thompson, editor of the\r\n_Colonist_. \"It was, I think, somewhere about the month of May, 1843,\r\nthat there walked into my office on Nelson Street a young man of\r\ntwenty-five years, tall, broad-shouldered, somewhat lantern-jawed and\r\nemphatically Scottish, who introduced himself to me as the travelling\r\nagent of the New York _British Chronicle_, published by his father.\r\nThis was George Brown, afterwards editor and publisher of the _Globe_\r\nnewspaper. He was a very pleasant-mannered, courteous, gentlemanly\r\nyoung fellow, and impressed me favourably. His father, he said, found\r\nthe political atmosphere of New York hostile to everything British,\r\nand that it was as much as a man's life was worth to give expression\r\nto any British predilections whatsoever (which I knew to be true).\r\nThey had, therefore, thought of transferring their publication to\r\nToronto, and intended to continue it as a thoroughly Conservative\r\njournal. I, of course, welcomed him as a co-worker in the same cause\r\nwith ourselves, little expecting how his ideas of Conservatism were to\r\ndevelop themselves in subsequent years.\" His Conservatism--assuming\r\nthat the young man was not misunderstood--was perhaps the result of a\r\nreaction from the experience of New York, in which democracy had\r\npresented itself in an unlovely aspect. Contact with Toronto Toryism\r\nof that day would naturally stiffen the Liberalism of a combative man.\r\n\r\nAs a result of George Brown's survey of the Canadian field, the\r\npublication of the _British Chronicle_ in New York ceased, and the\r\nBrowns removed to Toronto, where they established the _Banner_, a\r\nweekly paper partly Presbyterian and partly political, and in both\r\nfields championing the cause of government by the people. The first\r\nnumber was issued on August 18th, 1843. Referring to the disruption\r\nof the \"Scottish Church\" that had occurred three months before, the\r\n_Banner_ said: \"If we look to Scotland we shall find an event\r\nunparalleled in the history of the world. Nearly five hundred\r\nministers, backed by several thousand elders and perhaps a million of\r\npeople, have left the Church of their fathers because the civil courts\r\nhave trampled on what they deem the rights of the Christian people in\r\nScotland, exhibiting a lesson to the world which must produce results\r\nthat cannot yet be measured. The sacrifice made by these devoted\r\nministers of the Gospel is great; their reward is sure.\"\r\n\r\nThe columns of the _Banner_ illustrate in a striking way the\r\nintermingling, common in that day, of religion and politics. The\r\n_Banner's_ chief antagonist was the _Church_, a paper equally devoted\r\nto episcopacy and monarchy. Here is a specimen bit of controversy. The\r\n_Church_, arguing against responsible government, declares that as God\r\nis the only ruler of princes, princes cannot be accountable to the\r\npeople; and perdition is the lot of all rebels, agitators of sedition,\r\ndemagogues, who work under the pretence of reforming the State. All\r\nthe troubles of the country are due to parliaments constantly\r\ndemanding more power and thereby endangering the supremacy of the\r\nmother country. The _Banner_ is astonished by the unblushing avowal of\r\nthese doctrines, which had not been so openly proclaimed since the\r\ndays of \"High Church and Sacheverell,\" and which if acted upon would\r\nreduce the people to the level of abject slaves. Whence, it asks,\r\ncomes this doctrine of the irresponsibility of kings? \"It has been dug\r\nup from the tombs of Roman Catholic and High Church priests and of\r\nJacobite bigots. Wherever it gets a footing it carries bloodshed and\r\npersecution in its train. It cramps the freedom of thought. It\r\nrepresses commercial enterprise and industry. It dries up the springs\r\nof the human understanding. To what does Britain owe all her greatness\r\nbut to that free range of intellectual exertion which prompted Watt\r\nand Arkwright in their wonderful discoveries, which carried Anson and\r\nCook round the globe, and which enabled Newton to scale the heavens?\r\nIs the dial to be put back? Must the world once more adopt the\r\ndoctrine that the people are made for kings and not kings for the\r\npeople? Where will this treason to the British Constitution find the\r\nslightest warrant in the Word of God? We know that power alone\r\nproceeds from God, the very air we breathe is the gift of His bounty,\r\nand whatever public right is exercised from the most obscure elective\r\nfranchise to the king upon his throne is derived from Him to\r\nwhom we must account for the exercise of it. But does that\r\naccountability take away or lessen the political obligations of\r\nthe social compact?--assuredly not.\"\r\n\r\nThis style of controversy was typical of the time. Tories drew from\r\nthe French Revolution warnings against the heedless march of\r\ndemocracy. Reformers based arguments on the \"glorious revolution of\r\n1688.\" A bill for the secularization of King's College was denounced\r\nby Bishop Strachan, the stalwart leader of the Anglicans, in language\r\nof extraordinary vehemence. The bill would hold up the Christian\r\nreligion to the contempt of wicked men, and overturn the social order\r\nby unsettling property. Placing all forms of error on an equality with\r\ntruth, the bill represented a principle \"atheistical and monstrous,\r\ndestructive of all that was pure and holy in morals and religion.\" To\r\nfind parallels for this madness, the bishop referred to the French\r\nRevolution, when the Christian faith was abjured, and the Goddess of\r\nReason set up for worship; to pagan Rome, which, to please the natives\r\nshe had conquered, \"condescended to associate their impure idolatries\r\nwith her own.\"\r\n\r\nThese writings are quoted not merely as illustrations of extravagance\r\nof language. The language was the natural outcome of an extraordinary\r\nsituation. The bishop was not a voice crying in the wilderness; he was\r\na power in politics as well as in the Church, and had, as executive\r\ncouncillor, taken an important part in the government of the country.\r\nHe was not making extravagant pretensions, but defending a position\r\nactually held by his Church, a position which fell little short of\r\nabsolute domination. Religious equality was to be established, a great\r\nendowment of land converted from sectarian to public purposes, and a\r\nnon-sectarian system of education created. In this work Brown played a\r\nleading part, but before it could be undertaken it was necessary to\r\nvindicate the right of the people to self-government.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1843, the resignation of Metcalfe's ministers created a\r\ncrisis which soon absorbed the energy of the Browns and eventually led\r\nto the establishment of the _Globe_. In the issue of December 8th,\r\n1843, the principles of responsible government are explained, and the\r\n_Banner_ gives its support to the ministers. It cannot see why less\r\nconfidence should be bestowed by a governor-general in Canada than by\r\na sovereign in the British empire. It deplores the rupture and\r\ndeclares that it still belongs to no political party. It has no liking\r\nfor \"Democracy,\" a word which even Liberals at that time seemed to\r\nregard with horror. It asks Presbyterians to stand fast for the\r\nenjoyment of civil and religious liberty. It exhorts the people of\r\nCanada to be firm and patient and to let no feeling of disappointment\r\nlead their minds to republicanism. Those who would restrict the\r\nliberties of Canada also dwell on the evils of republicanism, but they\r\nare the very people who would bring it to pass. The _Banner's_ ideal\r\nis a system of just and equal government. If this is pursued, a vast\r\nnation will grow up speaking the same language, having the same laws\r\nand customs, and bound to the mother country by the strongest bonds of\r\naffection. The _Banner_, which had at first described itself as\r\nindependent in party politics, soon found itself drawn into a struggle\r\nwhich was too fierce and too momentous to allow men of strong\r\nconvictions to remain neutral. We find politics occupying more and\r\nmore attention in its columns, and finally on March 5th, 1844, the\r\n_Globe_ is established as the avowed ally of Baldwin and Lafontaine,\r\nand the advocate of responsible government. It will be necessary to\r\nexplain now the nature of the difference between Metcalfe and his\r\nministers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMETCALFE AND THE REFORMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Browns arrived in Canada in the period of reconstruction following\r\nthe rebellion of 1837-8. In Lord Durham's Report the rising in Lower\r\nCanada was attributed mainly to racial animosity--\"two nations warring\r\nin the bosom of a single state\"--\"a struggle not of principles but of\r\nraces.\" The rising in Upper Canada was attributed mainly to the\r\nascendency of the \"family compact\"--a family only in the official\r\nsense. \"The bench, the magistracy, the high offices of the episcopal\r\nchurch, and a great part of the legal profession, are filled by their\r\nadherents; by grant or purchase they have acquired nearly the whole of\r\nthe waste lands of the province; they are all-powerful in the\r\nchartered banks, and till lately shared among themselves almost\r\nexclusively all offices of trust and profit. The bulk of this party\r\nconsists, for the most part, of native born inhabitants of the colony,\r\nor of emigrants who settled in it before the last war with the United\r\nStates; the principal members of it belong to the Church of England,\r\nand the maintenance of the claims of that Church has always been one\r\nof its distinguishing characteristics.\" Reformers discovered that even\r\nwhen they triumphed at the polls, they could not break up this\r\ncombination, the executive government remaining constantly in the\r\nhands of their opponents. They therefore agitated for the\r\nresponsibility of the executive council to the legislative assembly.\r\n\r\nLord Durham's remedy was to unite Upper and Lower Canada, and to grant\r\nthe demand for responsible government. He hoped that the union would\r\nin time dispose of the racial difficulty. Estimating the population of\r\nUpper Canada at four hundred thousand, the English inhabitants of\r\nLower Canada at one hundred and fifty thousand, and the French at four\r\nhundred and fifty thousand, \"the union of the two provinces would not\r\nonly give a clear English majority, but one which would be increased\r\nevery year by the influence of English immigration; and I have little\r\ndoubt that the French, when once placed by the legitimate course of\r\nevents and the working of natural causes, in a minority, would abandon\r\ntheir vain hopes of nationality.\"\r\n\r\nThe future mapped out by Lord Durham for the French-Canadians was one\r\nof benevolent assimilation. He under-estimated their tenacity and\r\ntheir power of adapting themselves to new political conditions. They\r\nnot only retained their distinctive language and customs, but gained\r\nso large a measure of political power that in time Upper Canada\r\ncomplained that it was dominated by its partner. The union was\r\neffected soon after the report, but the granting of responsible\r\ngovernment was long delayed. From the submission of Lord Durham's\r\nReport to the time of Lord Elgin, the question of responsible\r\ngovernment was the chief issue in Canadian politics. Lord Durham's\r\nrecommendations were clear and specific. He maintained that harmony\r\nwould be restored \"not by weakening but strengthening the influence of\r\nthe people on its government; by confining within much narrower bounds\r\nthan those hitherto allotted to it, and not by extending, the\r\ninterference of the imperial authorities on the details of colonial\r\naffairs.\" The government must be administered on the principles that\r\nhad been found efficacious in Great Britain. He would not impair a\r\nsingle prerogative of the Crown, but the Crown must submit to the\r\nnecessary consequences of representative institutions, and must govern\r\nthrough those in whom the representative body had confidence.\r\n\r\nThese principles are now so well established that it is hard to\r\nrealize how bold and radical they appeared in 1839. Between that time\r\nand 1847, the British government sent out to Canada three governors,\r\nwith various instructions. Whatever the wording of these instructions\r\nwas, they always fell short of Durham's recommendations, and always\r\nexpressed a certain reluctance to entrusting the government of Canada\r\nunreservedly to representatives of the people.\r\n\r\nFrom 1842 to 1846 the government in Great Britain was that of Sir\r\nRobert Peel, and it was that government which set itself most\r\nstrongly against the granting of autonomy to Canada. It was\r\nConservative, and it probably received from correspondents in Canada a\r\ngood deal of misinformation and prejudiced opinion in regard to the\r\naims of the Reformers. But it was a group of men of the highest\r\ncharacter and capacity, concerning whom Gladstone has left on record a\r\nremarkable testimony. \"It is his conviction that in many of the most\r\nimportant rules of public policy, that government surpassed generally\r\nthe governments which have succeeded it, whether Liberal or\r\nConservative. Among them he would mention purity in patronage,\r\nfinancial strictness, loyal adherence to the principle of public\r\neconomy, jealous regard to the rights of parliament, a single eye to\r\nthe public interest, strong aversion to extension of territorial\r\nresponsibilities, and a frank admission of the rights of foreign\r\ncountries as equal to those of their own.\"\r\n\r\nWith this high estimate of the general character of the Peel\r\ngovernment must be coupled the undoubted fact that it entirely\r\nmisunderstood the situation in Canada, gave its support to the party\r\nof reaction, and needlessly delayed the establishment of\r\nself-government. We may attribute this in part to the distrust\r\noccasioned by the rebellion; in part to the use of partisan channels\r\nof information; but under all this was a deeper cause--inability to\r\nconceive of such a relation as exists between Great Britain and Canada\r\nto-day. In that respect Peel and his colleagues resembled most of the\r\npublic men of their time. They could understand separation; they could\r\nunderstand a relation in which the British government and its agents\r\nruled the colonies in a kindly and paternal fashion; but a union under\r\nwhich the colonies were nations in all but foreign relations passed\r\ntheir comprehension. When the colonies asked for complete\r\nself-government it was supposed that separation was really desired.\r\nSome were for letting them go in peace. Others were for holding them\r\nby political and commercial bonds. Of the latter class, Stanley,\r\ncolonial secretary under Peel, was a good type. He believed in\r\n\"strong\" governors; he believed in a system of preferential trade\r\nbetween Great Britain and the colonies, and his language might have\r\nbeen used, with scarcely any modification, by the Chamberlain party in\r\nthe recent elections in Great Britain. When, in 1843, he introduced\r\nthe measure giving a preference to Canadian wheat, he expressed the\r\nhope that it would restore content and prosperity to Canada; and when\r\nthat preference disappeared with the Corn Laws, he declared that the\r\nbasis of colonial union was destroyed.\r\n\r\nFrom the union to September, 1842, no French-Canadian name appears in\r\na Canadian government. French-Canadians were deeply dissatisfied with\r\nthe terms of the union; there was a strong reluctance to admitting\r\nthem to any share of power, and they complained bitterly that they\r\nwere politically ostracized by Sydenham, the first governor. His\r\nsuccessor, Bagot, adopted the opposite policy, and earned the severe\r\ncensure of the government at home.\r\n\r\nOn August 23rd, 1842, Sir Robert Peel wrote to Lord Stanley in terms\r\nwhich indicated a belief that Governor Bagot was experiencing great\r\ndifficulty in carrying on the government. He spoke of a danger of\r\nFrench-Canadians and Radicals, or French-Canadians and Conservatives,\r\ncombining to place the government in a minority. He suggested various\r\nmeans of meeting the danger, and said, \"I would not voluntarily throw\r\nmyself into the hands of the French party through fear of being in a\r\nminority.\"\r\n\r\nBefore instructions founded on this letter could reach the colony, the\r\ngovernor had acted, \"throwing himself,\" in the words of Peel's\r\nbiographer, \"into the hands of the party tainted by disaffection.\"\r\nWhat had really happened was that on September 16th, 1842, the\r\nCanadian government had been reconstructed, the principal change being\r\nthe introduction of Lafontaine and Baldwin as its leading members.\r\nThis action aroused a storm in Canada, where Bagot was fiercely\r\nassailed by the Tories for his so-called surrender to rebels. And that\r\nview was taken also in England.\r\n\r\nOn October 18th, 1842, Mr. Arbuthnot wrote to Sir Robert Peel: \"The\r\nDuke [Wellington] has been thunderstruck by the news from Canada.\r\nBetween ourselves, he considers what has happened as likely to be\r\nfatal to the connection with England; and I must also, in the very\r\nstrictest confidence, tell you that he dreads lest it should break up\r\nthe cabinet here at home.\"\r\n\r\nOn October 21st, Sir Robert Peel wrote to Lord Stanley, pointing out\r\nthe danger of the duke's strong and decisive condemnation: \"In various\r\nquarters the Duke of Wellington denouncing the arrangement as a tame\r\nsurrender to a party tainted with treason, would produce an impression\r\nmost dangerous to the government, if it could get over the effects\r\nproduced by the first announcement of his retirement, on the ground of\r\navowed difference of opinion.\" After reading Sir Charles Bagot's\r\nexplanations, he admitted that the governor's position was\r\nembarrassing. \"Suppose,\" he said in a subsequent letter, \"that Sir C.\r\nBagot was reduced to such difficulties that he had no alternative but\r\nto take the best men of the French-Canadian party into his councils,\r\nand that it was better for him to do this before there was a hostile\r\nvote; still, the manner in which he conducted his negotiations was a\r\nmost unwise one. He makes it appear to the world that he courted and\r\nrejoiced in the necessity for a change in his councils.\" On October\r\n24th the Duke of Wellington wrote expressing his agreement with Peel,\r\nand adding: \"However, it appears to me that we must consider the\r\narrangement as settled and adopted by the legislature of Canada. It\r\nwill remain to be considered afterwards what is to be done with Sir\r\nCharles Bagot and with his measures.\"\r\n\r\nThe question was solved by the death of the governor who had been\r\nunfortunate enough to arouse the storm, and to create a ministerial\r\ncrisis in Great Britain. It is believed that his end was hastened by\r\nthe news from England. He fell ill in November, grew steadily worse,\r\nand at last asked to be recalled, a request which was granted. At his\r\nlast cabinet council he bade an affectionate farewell to his\r\nministers, and begged them to defend his memory. His best vindication\r\nis found in the failure of Metcalfe's policy, and in the happy results\r\nof the policy of Elgin.\r\n\r\nThe events connected with the retirement of Bagot, which were not\r\nfully understood until the publication of Sir Robert Peel's papers a\r\nfew years ago, throw light upon the reasons which determined the\r\nselection of Sir Charles Metcalfe. Metcalfe was asked by Lord Stanley\r\nwhether he would be able and disposed to assume \"most honourable and\r\nat the same time very arduous duties in the public service.\" Metcalfe\r\nwrote to Captain Higginson, afterwards his private secretary: \"I am\r\nnot sure that the government of Canada is a manageable affair, and\r\nunless I think I can go to good purpose I will not go at all.\" Sir\r\nFrancis Hincks says: \"All Sir Charles Metcalfe's correspondence prior\r\nto his departure from England is indicative of a feeling that he was\r\ngoing on a forlorn hope expedition,\" and Hincks adds that such\r\nlanguage can be explained only on the assumption that he was sent out\r\nfor the purpose of overthrowing responsible government. It is\r\ncertainly established by the Peel correspondence that the British\r\ngovernment strongly disapproved of Sir Charles Bagot's policy, and\r\nselected Sir Charles Metcalfe as a man who would govern on radically\r\ndifferent lines. It is perhaps putting it rather strongly to say that\r\nhe was intended to overthrow responsible government. But he must have\r\ncome to Canada filled with distrust of the Canadian ministry, filled\r\nwith the idea that the demand for responsible government was a cloak\r\nfor seditious designs, and ready to take strong measures to preserve\r\nBritish connection. In this misunderstanding lay the source of his\r\nerrors and misfortunes in Canada.\r\n\r\nIt is not therefore necessary to enter minutely into the dispute which\r\noccasioned the rupture between Metcalfe and his advisers. On the\r\nsurface it was a dispute over patronage. In reality Baldwin and\r\nLafontaine were fighting for autonomy and responsible government;\r\nMetcalfe, as he thought, was defending the unity of the empire. He was\r\na kindly and conscientious man, and he held his position with some\r\nskill, always contending that he was willing to agree to responsible\r\ngovernment on condition that the colonial position was recognized, the\r\nprerogative of the Crown upheld, and the governor not dominated by\r\none political party.\r\n\r\nThe governor finally broke with his advisers in November, 1843. For\r\nsome months he was to govern, not only without a responsible ministry,\r\nbut without a parliament, for the legislature was immediately\r\nprorogued, and did not meet again before dissolution. His chief\r\nadviser was William Henry Draper, a distinguished lawyer, whose\r\npolitical career was sacrificed in the attempt to hold an impossible\r\nposition. Reformers and Tories prepared for a struggle which was to\r\ncontinue for several years, and which, in spite of the smallness of\r\nthe field, was of the highest importance in settling a leading\r\nprinciple of government.\r\n\r\nOn March 5th, 1844, as a direct consequence of the struggle, appeared\r\nthe first issue of the Toronto _Globe_, its motto taken from one of\r\nthe boldest letters of Junius to George III: \"The subject who is truly\r\nloyal to the chief magistrate will neither advise nor submit to\r\narbitrary measures.\" The leading article was a long and careful review\r\nof the history of the country, followed by a eulogy on the\r\nconstitution enjoyed by Great Britain since \"the glorious revolution\r\nof 1688,\" but denied to Canada. Responsible government was withheld;\r\nthe governor named his councillors in defiance of the will of the\r\nlegislature. Advocates of responsible government were stigmatized by\r\nthe governor's friends as rebels, traitors, radicals and republicans.\r\nThe _Globe_ proclaimed its adherence to Lord Durham's recommendation,\r\nand said: \"The battle which the Reformers of Canada will right is not\r\nthe battle of a party, but the battle of constitutional right against\r\nthe undue interference of executive power.\" The prospectus of the\r\npaper contained these words: \"Firmly attached to the principles of the\r\nBritish Constitution, believing the limited monarchy of Great Britain\r\nthe best system of government yet devised by the wisdom of man, and\r\nsincerely convinced that the prosperity of Canada will best be\r\nadvanced by a close connection between it and the mother country, the\r\neditor of the _Globe_ will support all measures which will tend to\r\ndraw closer the bonds of a mutually advantageous union.\"\r\n\r\nOn March 25th, 1844, the campaign was opened with a meeting called by\r\nthe Toronto Reform Association. Robert Baldwin, \"father of responsible\r\ngovernment,\" was in the chair, and William Hume Blake was the orator\r\nof the night. The young editor of the _Globe_, a recruit among\r\nveterans, seems to have made a hit with a picture of a ministry framed\r\non the \"no party\" plan advocated by Governor Metcalfe. In this\r\nimaginary ministry he grouped at the same council table Robert Baldwin\r\nand his colleague Francis Hincks; Sir Allan MacNab, the Tory leader;\r\nWilliam Henry Draper, Metcalfe's chief adviser; John Strachan, Bishop\r\nof Toronto; and Dr. Ryerson, leader of the Methodists and champion of\r\nthe governor. His Excellency is on a chair raised above the warring\r\nelements below. Baldwin moves that King's College be opened to all\r\nclasses of Her Majesty's subjects. At once the combination is\r\ndissolved, as any one who remembers Bishop Strachan's views on that\r\nquestion will understand.\r\n\r\nDr. Ryerson, whose name was used by Brown in this illustration, was a\r\nleader among the Methodists, and had fought stoutly for religious\r\nequality against Anglican privilege. But he had espoused the side of\r\nthe governor-general, apparently taking seriously the position that it\r\nwas the only course open to a loyal subject. In a series of letters\r\npublished in the summer of 1844, he warned the people that the Toronto\r\nReform Association was leading them to the edge of a precipice. \"In\r\nthe same manner,\" he said, \"I warned you against the Constitutional\r\nReform Association, formed in 1834. In 1837 my warning predictions\r\nwere realized, to the ruin of many and the misery of thousands. What\r\ntook place in 1837 was but a preface of what may be witnessed in\r\n1847.\" The warning he meant to convey was that the people were being\r\ndrawn into a conflict with the imperial authorities. \"Mr. Baldwin,\" he\r\nsaid, \"practically renounces the imperial authority by refusing to\r\nappeal to it, and by appealing through the Toronto Association to the\r\npeople of Canada. If the people of Canada are the tribunal of judgment\r\non one question of constitutional prerogative, they are so on every\r\nquestion of constitutional prerogative. Then the governor is no\r\nlonger responsible to the imperial authority, and Canada is an\r\nindependent country. Mr. Baldwin's proceeding, therefore, not only\r\nleads to independence but involves (unconsciously, I admit, from\r\nextreme and theoretical views), a practical declaration of\r\nindependence before the arrival of the 4th of July!\"\r\n\r\nIn this language Dr. Ryerson described with accuracy the attitude of\r\nthe British government. That government had, as we have seen,\r\ndisapproved of Governor Bagot's action in parting with so large a\r\nmeasure of power, and it was fully prepared to support Metcalfe in\r\npursuing the opposite course. Dr. Ryerson was also right in saying\r\nthat the government of Great Britain would be supported by parliament.\r\nIn May, 1844, the affairs of Canada were discussed in the British\r\nHouse of Commons, and the governor's action was justified by Peel, by\r\nLord Stanley, and by Lord John Russell. The only dissentient voices\r\nwere those of the Radicals, Hume and Roebuck.\r\n\r\nMetcalfe and his chiefs at home can hardly be blamed for holding the\r\nprevailing views of the time, which were that the changes contemplated\r\nby Durham, by Bagot, and by Baldwin were dangerous and revolutionary.\r\nThe idea that a colony could remain connected with Great Britain under\r\nsuch a system of autonomy as we enjoy to-day was then conceived by\r\nonly a few men of exceptional breadth and foresight, among whom Elgin\r\nwas one of the most eminent.\r\n\r\nThe wise leadership of Baldwin and Lafontaine and the patience and\r\nfirmness of the Reformers are attested by their conduct in very trying\r\ncircumstances. Finding their demand for constitutional reform opposed\r\nnot only by the Canadian Tories, but by the governor-general and the\r\nimperial government and parliament, they might have become\r\ndiscouraged, or have been tempted into some act of violence. Their\r\npatience must have been sorely tried by the persistent malice or\r\nobstinate prejudice which stigmatized a strictly constitutional\r\nmovement as treason. They had also to endure the trial of a temporary\r\ndefeat at the polls, and an apparent rejection of their policy by the\r\nvery people for whose liberties they were contending.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1844 the legislature was dissolved and a fierce\r\ncontest ensued. Governor Metcalfe's attitude is indicated by his\r\nbiographer.[1] \"The contest,\" he says, \"was between loyalty on the one\r\nside and disaffection to Her Majesty's government on the other. That\r\nthere was a strong anti-British feeling abroad, in both divisions of\r\nthe province [Upper and Lower Canada] Metcalfe clearly and painfully\r\nperceived. The conviction served to brace and stimulate him to new\r\nexertions. He felt that he was fighting for his sovereign against a\r\nrebellious people.\" The appeal was successful; Upper Canada was swept\r\nby the loyalty cry, and in various polling places votes were actually\r\ncast or offered for the governor-general. The _Globe_ described a\r\nconversation that occurred in a polling place in York: \"Whom do you\r\nvote for?\" \"I vote for the governor-general.\" \"There is no such\r\ncandidate. Say George Duggan, you blockhead.\" \"Oh, yes, George Duggan;\r\nit's all the same thing.\" There were candidates who described\r\nthemselves as \"governor-general's men\"; there were candidates whose\r\nroyalist enthusiasm was expressed in the name \"Cavaliers.\" In the\r\nMontreal election petition it was charged that during two days of\r\npolling the electors were exposed to danger from the attacks of bands\r\nof fighting men hired by the government candidates or their agents,\r\nand paid, fed, and armed with \"bludgeons, bowie-knives, and pistols\r\nand other murderous weapons\" for the purpose of intimidating the\r\nLiberal electors and preventing them from gaining access to the polls;\r\nthat Liberals were driven from the polls by these fighting men, and by\r\ncavalry and infantry acting under the orders of partisan magistrates.\r\nThe polls, it was stated, were surrounded by soldiers, field-pieces\r\nwere placed in several public squares, and the city was virtually in a\r\nstate of siege. The charges were not investigated, the petition being\r\nrejected for irregularity; but violence and intimidation were then\r\ncommon accompaniments of elections.\r\n\r\nIn November the governor was able to record his victory thus: Upper\r\nCanada, avowed supporters of his government, thirty; avowed\r\nadversaries, seven; undeclared and uncertain, five. Lower Canada,\r\navowed supporters, sixteen; avowed adversaries, twenty-one; undeclared\r\nand uncertain, four. Remarking on this difference between Upper\r\nand Lower Canada, he said that loyalty and British feeling\r\nprevailed in Upper Canada and in the Eastern Townships of Lower\r\nCanada, and that disaffection was predominant among the French-Canadian\r\nconstituencies.[2] Metcalfe honestly believed he had saved Canada for\r\nthe empire; but more mischief could hardly have been done by\r\ndeliberate design. In achieving a barren and precarious victory at the\r\npolls, he and his friends had run the risk of creating that\r\ndisaffection which they feared. The stigma of disloyalty had been\r\nunjustly affixed to honest and public-spirited men, whose steadiness\r\nalone prevented them, in their resentment, from joining the ranks of\r\nthe disaffected. Worse still, the line of political cleavage had been\r\nidentified with the line of racial division, and \"French-Canadian\" and\r\n\"rebel\" had been used as synonymous terms.\r\n\r\nThe ministry and the legislative assembly were now such as the\r\ngovernor had desired, yet the harmony was soon broken. There appeared\r\ndivisions in the cabinet, hostile votes in the legislature, and\r\nfinally a revolt in the Conservative press. An attempt to form a\r\ncoalition with the French-Canadian members drew a sarcastic comment\r\nfrom the _Globe_: \"Mr. Draper has invited the men whom he and his\r\nparty have for years stigmatized before the country as rebels and\r\ntraitors and destructives to join his administration.\" Reformers\r\nregarded these troubles as evidence that the experiment in reaction\r\nwas failing, and waited patiently for the end. Shortly after the\r\nelection the governor was raised to the peerage, an honour which, if\r\nnot earned by success in Canada, was fairly due to his honest\r\nintentions. He left Canada at the close of the year 1845, suffering\r\nfrom a painful disease, of which he died a year afterwards.\r\n\r\nSoon after the governor's departure the young editor of the _Globe_\r\nhad a curious experience. At a dinner of the St. Andrew's Society,\r\nToronto, the president, Judge MacLean, proposed the health of Lord\r\nMetcalfe, eulogized his Canadian policy, and insisted that he had not\r\nbeen recalled, \"as certain persons have most impertinently and untruly\r\nassumed and set forth.\" Brown refused to drink the toast, and asked to\r\nbe heard, asserting that he had been publicly insulted from the chair.\r\nAfter a scene of uproar, he managed to obtain a hearing, and said,\r\naddressing the chairman: \"I understand your allusions, sir, and your\r\nepithet of impertinence as applied to myself. I throw it back on you\r\nwith contempt, and will content myself with saying that your using\r\nsuch language and dragging such matters before the society was highly\r\nimproper. Lord Metcalfe, sir, has been recalled, and it may yet be\r\nseen that it was done by an enlightened British government for cause.\r\nThe toast which you have given, too, and the manner in which it was\r\nintroduced, are highly improper. This is not the place to discuss Lord\r\nMetcalfe's administration. There is a wide difference of opinion as to\r\nit. But I refrain from saying one word as to his conduct in this\r\nprovince. This is not a political but a benevolent society, composed\r\nof persons of very varied political sentiments, and such a toast ought\r\nnever to have been brought here. Lord Metcalfe is not now\r\ngovernor-general of Canada, and I had a right to refuse to do honour\r\nto him or not as I saw fit, and that without any disparagement to his\r\nconduct as a gentleman, even though the person who is president of\r\nthis society thinks otherwise.\" This incident, trivial as it may\r\nappear, illustrates the passion aroused by the contest, and the bold\r\nand resolute character of the young politician.\r\n\r\nLord Metcalfe's successor was Earl Cathcart, a soldier who concerned\r\nhimself little in the political disputes of the country, and who had\r\nbeen chosen because of the danger of war with the United States,\r\narising out of the dispute over the Oregon boundary. The settlement of\r\nthat dispute does not come within the scope of this work; but it may\r\nbe noted that the _Globe_ was fully possessed by the belligerent\r\nspirit of the time, and frankly expressed the hope that Great Britain\r\nwould fight, not merely for the Oregon boundary, but \"to proclaim\r\nliberty to the black population.\" The writer hoped that the Christian\r\nnations of the world would combine and \"break the chains of the slaves\r\nin the United States, in Brazil and in Cuba.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Kaye's _Life of Metcalfe_, Vol. II., p. 389.\r\n\r\n[2] Kaye's _Life of Metcalfe_, Vol. II., p. 390.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nRESPONSIBLE GOVERNMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn England, as well as in Canada, events were moving towards\r\nself-government. With the repeal of the Corn Laws in 1840 disappeared\r\nthe preference to Canadian wheat. \"Destroy this principle of\r\nprotection,\" said Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, \"and you destroy\r\nthe whole basis upon which your colonial system rests.\" Loud\r\ncomplaints came from Canada, and in a despatch from Earl Cathcart to\r\nthe colonial secretary, it was represented that the Canadian waterways\r\nhad been improved on the strength of the report made to Great Britain,\r\nand that the disappointment and loss resulting from the abolition of\r\nthe preference would lead to alienation from the mother country and\r\n\"annexation to our rival and enemy, the United States.\" Gladstone, in\r\nhis reply, denied that the basis of imperial unity was protection,\r\n\"the exchange, not of benefits, but of burdens;\" the true basis lay in\r\ncommon feelings, traditions and hopes. The _Globe_ held that Canada\r\nhad no right to complain if the people of the United Kingdom did what\r\nwas best for themselves. England, as an exporter of manufactures, had\r\nto meet competition at the world's prices, and must have cheap food\r\nsupplies. Canada had surely a higher destiny than to export a few\r\nhundred bushels of wheat and flour to England. Canadian home\r\nmanufactures must be encouraged, and efforts made to obtain free trade\r\nwith the United States. \"The Tory press,\" said the _Globe_, \"are out\r\nin full cry against free trade. Their conduct affords an illustration\r\nof the unmitigated selfishness of Toryism. Give them everything they\r\ncan desire and they are brimful of loyalty. They will shout pæans till\r\nthey are sick, and drink goblets till they are blind in favour of\r\n'wise and benevolent governors' who will give them all the offices and\r\nall the emoluments. But let their interests, real or imaginary, be\r\naffected, and how soon does their loyalty evaporate! Nothing is now\r\ntalked of but separation from the mother country, unless the mother\r\ncontinues feeding them in the mode prescribed by the child.\"\r\n\r\nSome time afterwards, Lord Elgin, in his communications to the home\r\ngovernment, said that the Canadian millers and shippers had a\r\nsubstantial grievance, not in the introduction of free trade, but in\r\nthe constant tinkering incident to the abandoned system of imperial\r\nprotection. The preference given in 1843 to Canadian wheat and to\r\nflour, even when made of American wheat, had stimulated milling in\r\nCanada; but almost before the newly-built mills were fairly at work,\r\nthe free trade measure of 1846 swept the advantage away. What was\r\nwrong was not free trade, but Canadian dependence on imperial tariff\r\nlegislation.\r\n\r\nElgin was one of the few statesmen of his day who perceived that the\r\ncolonies might enjoy commercial independence and political equality,\r\nwithout separation. He declared that imperial unity did not depend on\r\nthe exercise of dominion, the dispensing of patronage, or the\r\nmaintenance of an imperial hot-bed for forcing commerce and\r\nmanufactures. Yet he conceived of an empire not confined to the\r\nBritish Islands, but growing, expanding, \"strengthening itself from\r\nage to age, and drawing new supplies of vitality from virgin soils.\"\r\n\r\nWith Elgin's administration began the new era of self-government. The\r\nlegislature was dissolved towards the close of the year 1847, and the\r\nelection resulted in a complete victory for the Reformers. In Upper\r\nCanada the contest was fairly close, but in Lower Canada the\r\nConservative forces were almost annihilated, and on the first vote in\r\nparliament the government was defeated by a large majority. The second\r\nBaldwin-Lafontaine government received the full confidence and loyal\r\nsupport of the governor, and by its conduct and achievements justified\r\nthe reform that had been so long delayed, and adopted with so many\r\nmisgivings. But the fight for responsible government was not yet\r\nfinished. The cry of French and rebel domination was raised, as it had\r\nbeen raised in the days of Governor Bagot. A Toronto journal\r\nreproachfully referred to Lord Elgin's descent from \"the Bruce,\" and\r\nasked how a man of royal ancestry could so degrade himself as to\r\nconsort with rebels and political jobbers. \"Surely the curse of\r\nMinerva, uttered by a great poet against the father, clings to the\r\nson.\" The removal of the old office-holders seemed to this writer to\r\nbe an act of desecration not unlike the removal of the famous marbles\r\nfrom the Parthenon. In a despatch explaining his course on the\r\nRebellion Losses Bill, Lord Elgin said that long before that\r\nlegislation there were evidences of the temper which finally produced\r\nthe explosion. He quoted the following passage from a newspaper: \"When\r\nFrench tyranny becomes insupportable, we shall find our Cromwell.\r\nSheffield in olden times used to be famous for its keen and\r\nwell-tempered whittles. Well, they make bayonets there now, just as\r\nsharp and just as well-tempered. When we can stand tyranny no longer,\r\nit will be seen whether good bayonets in Saxon hands will not be more\r\nthan a match for a mace and a majority.\" All the fuel for a\r\nconflagration was ready. There was race hatred, there was party\r\nhostility, there was commercial depression and there was a sincere,\r\nthough exaggerated, loyalty, which regarded rebellion as the\r\nunforgivable sin, and which was in constant dread of the spread of\r\nradical, republican and democratic ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Rebellion Losses Bill was all that was needed to fan the embers\r\ninto flame. This was a measure intended to compensate persons who had\r\nsuffered losses during the rebellion in Lower Canada. It was attacked\r\nas a measure for \"rewarding rebels.\" Lord Elgin afterwards said that\r\nhe did not believe a rebel would receive a farthing. But even if we\r\nsuppose that some rebels or rebel sympathizers were included in the\r\nlist, the outcry against the bill was unreasonable. A general amnesty\r\nhad been proclaimed; French-Canadians had been admitted to a full\r\nshare of political power. The greater things having been granted, it\r\nwas mere pedantry to haggle about the less, and to hold an elaborate\r\ninquiry into the principles of every man whose barns had been burned\r\nduring the rebellion. When responsible government was conceded, it was\r\nadmitted that even the rebels had not been wholly wrong. It would have\r\nbeen straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel to say \"we will give\r\nyou these free institutions for the sake of which you rebelled, but we\r\nwill not pay you the small sum of money necessary to recompense you\r\nfor losses arising out of the rebellion.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, it is easier to discuss these matters coolly in 1906 than it\r\nwas in 1849, and in 1849 the notion of \"rewarding the rebels\" produced\r\nanother rebellion on a small scale. A large quantity of important\r\nlegislation was brought down by the new government when it met the\r\nlegislature early in 1849, but everything else was forgotten when Mr.\r\nLafontaine introduced the resolution on which the Rebellion Losses\r\nBill was founded. In various parts of Upper Canada meetings were held\r\nand protests made against the measure. In Toronto the protests took\r\nthe form of mob violence, foreshadowing what was to come in Montreal.\r\nEffigies of Baldwin and Blake were carried through the streets and\r\nburned. William Lyon Mackenzie had lately returned to Canada, and was\r\nliving at the house of a citizen named Mackintosh. The mob went to the\r\nhouse, threatened to pull it down, and burned an effigy of Mackenzie.\r\nThe windows of the house were broken and stones and bricks thrown in.\r\nThe _Globe_ office was apparently not molested, but about midnight the\r\nmob went to the dwelling-house of the Browns, battered at the door and\r\nbroke some windows. The _Globe_ in this trying time stood staunchly by\r\nthe government and Lord Elgin, and powerfully influenced the public\r\nopinion of Upper Canada in their favour. Addresses calling for the\r\nwithdrawal of Lord Elgin were met by addresses supporting his action,\r\nand the signatures to the friendly addresses outnumbered the other by\r\none hundred and twenty thousand. George Brown, Col. C. T. Baldwin, and\r\nW. P. Howland were deputed to present an address from the Reformers of\r\nUpper Canada. Sir William Howland has said that Lord Elgin was so much\r\naffected that he shed tears.\r\n\r\nThis is not the place, however great the temptation may be, to\r\ndescribe the stirring scenes that were enacted in Montreal; the stormy\r\ndebate, the fiery speech in which William Hume Blake hurled back at\r\nthe Tories the charge of disloyalty; the tumult in the galleries, the\r\nburning of the parliament buildings, and the mobbing and stoning of\r\nthe governor-general.\r\n\r\nLord Elgin's bearing under this severe trial was admirable. He was\r\nmost desirous that blood should not be shed, and for this reason\r\navoided the use of troops or the proclamation of martial law; and he\r\nhad the satisfaction of seeing the storm gradually subside. A less\r\ndangerous evidence of discontent was a manifesto signed by leading\r\ncitizens of Montreal advocating annexation to the United States, not\r\nonly to relieve commercial depression, but \"to settle the race\r\nquestion forever, by bringing to bear on the French-Canadians the\r\npowerful assimilating forces of the republic.\" The signers of this\r\ndocument were leniently dealt with; but those among them who\r\nafterwards took a prominent part in politics, were not permitted to\r\nforget their error. Elgin was of opinion that there was ground for\r\ndiscontent on commercial grounds, and he advocated the removal of\r\nimperial restriction on navigation, and the establishment of\r\nreciprocity between the United States and the British North American\r\nprovinces. The annexation movement was confined chiefly to Montreal.\r\nIn Upper Canada an association called the British American League was\r\nformed, and a convention held at Kingston in 1849. The familiar topics\r\nof commercial depression and French domination were discussed; some\r\nviolent language was used, but the remedies proposed were sane\r\nenough; they were protection, retrenchment, and the union of the\r\nBritish provinces. Union, it was said, would put an end to French\r\ndomination, and would give Canada better access to the sea and\r\nincreased commerce. The British American League figures in the old,\r\nand not very profitable, controversy as to the share of credit to be\r\nallotted to each political party for the work of confederation. It is\r\npart of the Conservative case. But the platform was abandoned for the\r\ntime, and confederation remained in the realm of speculation rather\r\nthan of action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDISSENSION AMONG REFORMERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of one parliament, less than four years, the\r\nBaldwin-Lafontaine government achieved a large amount of useful work,\r\nincluding the establishment of cheap and uniform postage, the\r\nreforming of the courts of law, the remodelling of the municipal\r\nsystem, the establishment of the University of Toronto on a\r\nnon-sectarian basis, and the inauguration of a policy by which the\r\nprovince was covered with a network of railways. With such a record,\r\nthe government hardly seemed to be open to a charge of lack of energy\r\nand progressiveness, but it was a time when radicalism was in the air.\r\nIt may be more than a coincidence that Chartism in England and a\r\nrevolution in France were followed by radical movements in both\r\nCanadas.\r\n\r\nThe counterpart to the Rouge party in Lower Canada, elsewhere referred\r\nto, was the Clear Grit party in Upper Canada. Among its leaders were\r\nPeter Perry, one of the founders of the Reform party in Upper Canada,\r\nCaleb Hopkins, David Christie, James Lesslie, Dr. John Rolph and\r\nWilliam Macdougall. Rolph had played a leading part in the movement\r\nfor reform before the rebellion, and is the leading figure in Dent's\r\nhistory of that period. Macdougall was a young lawyer and journalist\r\nfighting his way into prominence.\r\n\r\n\"Grit\" afterwards became a nickname for a member of the Reform or\r\nLiberal party, and especially for the enthusiastic followers of George\r\nBrown. Yet in all the history of a quarrelsome period in politics\r\nthere is no more violent quarrel than that between Brown and the Clear\r\nGrits. It is said that Brown and Christie were one day discussing the\r\nmovement, and that Brown had mentioned the name of a leading Reformer\r\nas one of the opponents of the new party. Christie replied that the\r\nparty did not want such men, they wanted only those who were \"Clear\r\nGrit.\" This is one of several theories as to the derivation of the\r\nname. The _Globe_ denounced the party as \"a miserable clique of\r\noffice-seeking, bunkum-talking cormorants, who met in a certain\r\nlawyer's office on King Street [Macdougall's] and announced their\r\nintention to form a new party on Clear Grit principles.\" The _North\r\nAmerican_, edited by Macdougall, denounced Brown with equal fury as a\r\nservile adherent of the Baldwin government. Brown for several years\r\nwas in this position of hostility to the Radical wing of the party. He\r\nwas defeated in Haldimand by William Lyon Mackenzie, who stood on an\r\nadvanced Radical platform; and in 1851 his opponent in Kent and\r\nLambton was Malcolm Cameron, a Clear Grit, who had joined the\r\nHincks-Morin government. The nature of their relations is shown by a\r\nletter in which Cameron called on one of his friends to come out and\r\noppose Brown: \"I will be out and we will show him up, and let him know\r\nwhat stuff Liberal Reformers are made of, and how they would treat\r\nfanatical beasts who would allow no one liberty but themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe Clear Grits advocated, (1) the application of the elective\r\nprinciple to all the officials and institutions of the country, from\r\nthe head of the government downwards; (2) universal suffrage; (3) vote\r\nby ballot; (4) biennial parliaments; (5) the abolition of property\r\nqualification for parliamentary representations; (6) a fixed term for\r\nthe holding of general elections and for the assembling of the\r\nlegislature; (7) retrenchment; (8) the abolition of pensions to\r\njudges; (9) the abolition of the Courts of Common Pleas and Chancery\r\nand the giving of an enlarged jurisdiction to the Court of Queen's\r\nBench; (10) reduction of lawyers' fees; (11) free trade and direct\r\ntaxation; (12) an amended jury law; (13) the abolition or modification\r\nof the usury laws; (14) the abolition of primogeniture; (15) the\r\nsecularization of the clergy reserves, and the abolition of the\r\nrectories. The movement was opposed by the _Globe_. No new party, it\r\nsaid, was required for the advocacy of reform of the suffrage,\r\nretrenchment, law reform, free trade or the liberation of the clergy\r\nreserves. These were practical questions, on which the Reform party\r\nwas united. But these were placed on the programme merely to cloak\r\nits revolutionary features, features that simply meant the adoption of\r\nrepublican institutions, and the taking of the first step towards\r\nannexation. The British system of responsible government was upheld by\r\nthe _Globe_ as far superior to the American system in the security it\r\nafforded to life and property.\r\n\r\nBut while Brown defended the government from the attacks of the Clear\r\nGrits, he was himself growing impatient at their delay in dealing with\r\ncertain questions that he had at heart, especially the secularization\r\nof the clergy reserves. He tried, as we should say to-day, \"to reform\r\nthe party from within.\" He was attacked for his continued support of a\r\nministry accused of abandoning principles while \"he was endeavouring\r\nto influence the members to a right course without an open rupture.\"\r\nThere was an undercurrent of discontent drawing him away from the\r\ngovernment. In October, 1850, the _Globe_ contained a series of\r\narticles on the subject. It was pointed out that there were four\r\nparties in the country: the old-time Tories, the opponents of\r\nresponsible government, whose members were fast diminishing; the new\r\nparty led by John A. Macdonald; the Ministerialists; and the Clear\r\nGrits, who were described as composed of English Radicals, Republicans\r\nand annexationists. The Ministerialists had an overwhelming majority\r\nover all, but were disunited. What was the trouble? The ministers\r\nmight be a little slow, a little wanting in tact, a little less\r\ndemocratic than some of their followers. They were not traitors to the\r\nReform cause, and intemperate attacks on them might be disastrous to\r\nthat cause. A union of French-Canadians with Upper Canadian\r\nConservatives would, it was prophesied, make the Reform party\r\npowerless. Though in later years George Brown became known as the\r\nchief opponent of French-Canadian influence, he was well aware of the\r\nvalue of the alliance, and he gave the French-Canadians full credit\r\nfor their support to measures of reform. \"Let the truth be known,\"\r\nsaid the _Globe_ at this time, \"to the French-Canadians of Lower\r\nCanada are the Reformers of Upper Canada indebted for the sweeping\r\nmajorities which carried their best measures.\" He gave the government\r\ncredit for an immense mass of useful legislation enacted in a very\r\nshort period. But more remained to be done. The clergy reserves must\r\nbe abolished, and all connection between Church and State swept away.\r\n\"The party in power has no policy before the country. No one knows\r\nwhat measures are to be brought forward by the leaders. Each man\r\nfancies a policy for himself. The conductors of the public press must\r\ntake ground on all the questions of the day, and each accordingly\r\nstrikes out such a line as suits his own leanings, the palates of his\r\nreaders, or what he deems for the good of the country. All sorts of\r\nvague schemes are thus thrown on the sea of public opinion to agitate\r\nthe waters, with the triple result of poisoning the public mind,\r\nproducing unnecessary divisions, and committing sections of the party\r\nto views and principles which they might never have contemplated under\r\na better system.\"\r\n\r\nFor some time the articles in the _Globe_ did not pass the bounds of\r\nfriendly, though outspoken, criticism. The events that drew Brown into\r\nopposition were his breach with the Roman Catholic Church, the\r\ncampaign in Haldimand in which he was defeated by William Lyon\r\nMackenzie, the retirement of Baldwin and the accession to power of the\r\nHincks-Morin administration.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1850 there arrived in Canada copies of a pastoral\r\nletter by Cardinal Wiseman, defending the famous papal bull which\r\ndivided England into sees of the Roman Catholic Church, and gave\r\nterritorial titles to the bishops. Sir E. P. Taché, a member of the\r\ngovernment, showed one of these to Mr. Brown, and jocularly challenged\r\nhim to publish it in the _Globe_. Brown accepted the challenge,\r\ndeclaring that he would also publish a reply, to be written by\r\nhimself. The reply, which will be found in the _Globe_ of December\r\n10th, 1850, is argumentative in tone, and probably would not of itself\r\nhave involved Brown in a violent quarrel with the Church. The\r\nfollowing passage was afterwards cited by the _Globe_ as defining its\r\nposition: \"In offering a few remarks upon Dr. Wiseman's production, we\r\nhave no intention to discuss the tenets of the Roman Catholic Church,\r\nbut merely to look at the question in its secular aspect. As advocates\r\nof the voluntary principle we give to every man full liberty to\r\nworship as his conscience dictates, and without penalty, civil or\r\necclesiastical, attaching to his exercise thereof. We would allow each\r\nsect to give to its pastors what titles it sees fit, and to prescribe\r\nthe extent of spiritual duties; but we would have the State recognize\r\nno ecclesiastical titles or boundaries whatever. The public may, from\r\ncourtesy, award what titles they please; but the statute-book should\r\nrecognize none. The voluntary principle is the great cure for such\r\ndissensions as now agitate Great Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThe cause of conflict lay outside the bounds of that article. Cardinal\r\nWiseman's letter and Lord John Russell's reply had thrown England into\r\na ferment of religious excitement. \"Lord John Russell,\" says Justin\r\nMcCarthy, \"who had more than any man living been identified with the\r\nprinciples of religious liberty, who had sat at the feet of Fox and\r\nhad for his closest friend the poet, Thomas Moore, came to be regarded\r\nby the Roman Catholics as the bitterest enemy of their creed and their\r\nrights of worship.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this hatred of Russell was carried across the\r\nAtlantic, and that Brown was regarded as his ally. In the Haldimand\r\nelection a hand-bill signed, \"An Irish Roman Catholic\" was circulated.\r\nIt assailed Brown fiercely for the support he had given to Russell,\r\nand for the general course of the _Globe_ in regard to Catholic\r\nquestions. Russell was described as attempting \"to twine again around\r\nthe writhing limbs of ten millions of Catholics the chains that our\r\nown O'Connell rescued us from in 1829.\" A vote for George Brown would\r\nhelp to rivet these spiritual chains round the souls of Irishmen, and\r\nto crush the religion for which Ireland had wept oceans of blood;\r\nthose who voted for Brown would be prostrating themselves like\r\ncowardly slaves or beasts of burden before the avowed enemies of their\r\ncountry, their religion and their God. \"You will think of the gibbets,\r\nthe triangles, the lime-pits, the tortures, the hangings of the past.\r\nYou will reflect on the struggles of the present against the new penal\r\nbill. You will look forward to the dangers, the triumphs, the hopes of\r\nthe future, and then you will go to the polls and vote against George\r\nBrown.\"\r\n\r\nThis was not the only handicap with which Brown entered on his first\r\nelection contest. There was no cordial sympathy between him and the\r\ngovernment, yet he was hampered by his connection with the government.\r\nThe dissatisfied Radicals rallied to the support of William Lyon\r\nMackenzie, whose sufferings in exile also made a strong appeal to the\r\nhearts of Reformers, and Mackenzie was elected.\r\n\r\nIn his election address Brown declared himself for perfect religious\r\nequality, the separation of Church and State, and the diversion of\r\nthe clergy reserves from denominational to educational purposes. \"I am\r\nin favour of national school education free from sectarian teaching,\r\nand available without charge to every child in the province. I desire\r\nto see efficient grammar schools established in each county, and that\r\nthe fees of these institutions and of the national university should\r\nbe placed on such a scale as will bring a high literary and scientific\r\neducation within the reach of men of talent in any rank of life.\" He\r\nadvocated free trade in the fullest sense, expressing the hope that\r\nthe revenue from public lands and canals, with strict economy, would\r\nenable Canada \"to dispense with the whole customs department.\"\r\n\r\nBrown's estrangement from the government did not become an open\r\nrupture so long as Baldwin and Lafontaine were at the head of affairs.\r\nIn the summer following Brown's defeat in Haldimand, Baldwin resigned\r\nowing to a resolution introduced by William Lyon Mackenzie, for the\r\nabolition of the Court of Chancery. The resolution was defeated, but\r\nobtained the votes of a majority of the Upper Canadian members, and\r\nMr. Baldwin regarded their action as an indication of want of\r\nconfidence in himself. He dropped some expressions, too, which\r\nindicated that he was moved by larger considerations. He was\r\nconservative in his views, and he regarded the Mackenzie vote as a\r\nsign of a flood of radicalism which he felt powerless to stay.\r\nShortly afterwards Lafontaine retired. He, also, was conservative in\r\nhis temperament, and weary of public life. The passing of Baldwin and\r\nLafontaine from the scene helped to clear the way for Mr. Brown to\r\ntake his own course, and it was not long before the open breach\r\noccurred. When Mr. Hincks became premier, Mr. Brown judged that the\r\ntime had come for him to speak out. He felt that he must make a fair\r\nstart with the new government, and have a clear understanding at the\r\noutset. A new general election was approaching, and he thought that\r\nthe issue of separation of Church and State must be clearly placed\r\nbefore the country. In an article in the _Globe_ entitled \"The\r\nCrisis,\" it was declared that the time for action had come. One\r\nparliament had been lost to the friends of religious equality; they\r\ncould not afford to lose another. It was contended that the Upper\r\nCanadian Reformers suffered by their connection with the Lower\r\nCanadian party. Complaint was made that the Hon. E. P. Taché had\r\nadvised Roman Catholics to make common cause with Anglicans in\r\nresisting the secularization of the clergy reserves, had described the\r\nadvocates of secularization as \"pharisaical brawlers,\" and had said\r\nthat the Church of England need not fear their hostility, because the\r\n\"contra-balancing power\" of the Lower Canadians would be used to\r\nprotect the Anglican Church. This, said the _Globe_, was a challenge\r\nwhich the friends of religious equality could not refuse. Later on,\r\nMr. Brown wrote a series of letters to Mr. Hincks, setting forth\r\nfully his grounds of complaint against the government: failure to\r\nreform the representation of Upper Canada, slackness in dealing with\r\nthe secularization of the clergy reserves, weakness in yielding to the\r\ndemand for separate schools. All this he attributed to Roman Catholic\r\nor French-Canadian influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CLERGY RESERVES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe clergy reserves were for many years a fruitful source of\r\ndiscontent and agitation in Canada. They had their origin in a\r\nprovision of the Constitutional Act of 1791, that there should be\r\nreserved for the maintenance and support of a \"Protestant clergy\" in\r\nUpper and Lower Canada \"a quantity of land equal in value to a seventh\r\npart of grants that had been made in the past or might be made in the\r\nfuture.\" It was provided also that rectories might be erected and\r\nendowed according to the establishment of the Church of England. The\r\nlegislatures were to be allowed to vary or repeal these enactments,\r\nbut such legislation was not to receive the royal assent before it had\r\nbeen laid before both Houses of the imperial parliament.\r\n\r\nDid the words \"Protestant clergy\" apply to any other body than the\r\nChurch of England? A vast amount of legal learning was expended on\r\nthis question; but there can be little doubt that the intention to\r\nestablish and endow the Church of England was thoroughly in accord\r\nwith the ideas of colonial government prevailing from the conquest to\r\nthe end of the eighteenth century. In the instructions to Murray and\r\nother early governors there are constant injunctions for the support\r\nof a Protestant clergy and Protestant schools, \"to the end that the\r\nChurch of England may be established both in principles and\r\npractice.\"[3] Governor Simcoe, we are told, attached much importance\r\nto \"every establishment of Church and State that upholds a distinction\r\nof ranks and lessens the undue weight of the democratic influence.\"\r\n\"The episcopal system was interwoven and connected with the\r\nmonarchical foundations of our government.\"[4] In pursuance of this\r\nidea, which was also that of the ruling class in Canada, the country\r\nwas to be made as much unlike the United States as possible by the\r\nintrenchment of class and ecclesiastical privileges, and this was the\r\npolicy pursued up to the time that responsible government was\r\nobtained. Those outside the dominant caste, in religion as in\r\npolitics, were branded as rebels, annexationists, Yankees,\r\nrepublicans. And as this dominant caste, until the arrival of Lord\r\nElgin, had the ear of the authorities at home, it is altogether likely\r\nthat the Act of 1791 was framed in accordance with their views.\r\n\r\nThe law was unjust, improvident, and altogether unsuited to the\r\ncircumstances of the colony. Lord Durham estimated that the members\r\nand adherents of the Church of England, allowing its largest claim,\r\nwere not more than one-third, probably not more than one-fourth, of\r\nthe population of Upper Canada. Methodists, Presbyterians, and Roman\r\nCatholics, each claimed a larger membership. He declared that the\r\nsanction given to the exclusive claims of the Church of England by Sir\r\nJohn Colborne's establishment of fifty-seven rectories, was, in the\r\nopinion of many persons, the chief pre-disposing cause of the\r\nrebellion, and it was an abiding and unabated cause of discontent.[5]\r\n\r\nNot only was the spirit of the colony opposed to the establishment and\r\ndomination of any Church, but settlement was retarded and the\r\nhardships of the settler increased by the locking up of enormous\r\ntracts of land. In addition to the clergy reserves, grants were made\r\nto officials, to militia men, to the children of United Empire\r\nLoyalists and others, in the hope that these persons would settle on\r\nthe land. Many of these fell into the hands of speculators and\r\njobbers, who bought farms of two hundred acres for prices ranging from\r\na gallon of rum to £5. \"The greater part of these grants,\" said Mr.\r\nHawke, a government official whose evidence is given in the appendix\r\nto Durham's Report, \"remain in an unimproved state. These blocks of\r\nwild land place the actual settler in an almost hopeless condition; he\r\ncan hardly expect during his lifetime to see his neighbourhood contain\r\na population sufficiently dense to support mills, schools,\r\npost-offices, places of worship, markets or shops, without which\r\ncivilization retrogrades. Roads, under such circumstances, can neither\r\nbe opened by the settlers nor kept in proper repair. In 1834 I met a\r\nsettler from the township of Warwick, on the Caradoc Plains, returning\r\nfrom the grist mill at Westminster, with the flour and bran of\r\nthirteen bushels of wheat. He had a yoke of oxen and a horse attached\r\nto his wagon, and had been absent nine days and did not expect to\r\nreach home until the following evening. Light as his load was, he\r\nassured me that he had to unload, wholly or in part, several times,\r\nand after driving his wagon through the swamps, to pick out a road\r\nthrough the woods where the swamps or gullies were fordable, and to\r\ncarry the bags on his back and replace them in the wagon.\"\r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary here to discuss differences of opinion as to the\r\ninterpretation of the law, attempts to divide the endowment among\r\nvarious denominations, or other efforts at compromise. The radical\r\nwing of the Reform party demanded that the special provision for the\r\nsupport of the Church of England should be abolished, and a system of\r\nfree popular education established. With this part of their platform\r\nBrown was heartily in accord; on this point he agreed with the Clear\r\nGrits that the Baldwin-Lafontaine government was moving too slowly,\r\nand when Baldwin was succeeded by Hincks in 1851, the restraining\r\ninfluence of his respect for Baldwin being removed, his discontent\r\nwas converted into open and determined opposition.\r\n\r\nLargely by the influence of Brown and the _Globe_, public opinion in\r\n1851 was aroused to a high degree, and meetings were held to advocate\r\nthe secularization of the clergy reserves. The friends of the old\r\norder were singularly unfortunate in their mode of expressing their\r\nopinions. Opposition to responsible government was signalized by the\r\nburning of the parliament buildings, and the mobbing of Lord Elgin in\r\nMontreal. Opposition to religious equality was signalized by the\r\nmobbing of an orderly assembly in Toronto. One meeting of the\r\nopponents of the clergy reserves was broken up by these means, and a\r\nsecond meeting was attacked by a mob with such violence as to\r\nnecessitate the calling out of a company of British soldiers. This\r\nmeeting was held in St. Lawrence Hall, over the city market bearing\r\nthat name. Mr. Brown was chosen to move a resolution denouncing State\r\nendowments of religion, and did so in a speech of earnestness and\r\nargumentative power. He compared the results of Church establishments\r\nwith those of voluntary effort in England, in Scotland, in France, and\r\nin Canada, and denounced \"State-churchism\" as the author of pride,\r\nintolerance and spiritual coldness. \"When,\" he said, \"I read the\r\nhistory of the human race, and trace the dark record of wars and\r\ncarnage, of tyranny, robbery and injustice in every shape, which have\r\nbeen the fruits of State-churchism in every age; when I observe the\r\ndegenerating effect which it has ever had on the purity and simplicity\r\nof the Gospel of Christ, turning men's minds from its great truths, as\r\na religion of the heart, to the mere outward tinsel, to the forms and\r\nceremonies on which priestcraft flourishes; when I see that at all\r\ntimes it has been made the instrument of the rich and powerful in\r\noppressing the poor and weak, I cannot but reject it utterly as in\r\ndirect hostility to the whole spirit of the Gospel, to that glorious\r\nsystem which teaches men to set not their hearts on this world, and to\r\nwalk humbly before God.\" He held that it was utterly impossible for\r\nthe State to teach religious truth. \"There is no standard for truth.\r\nWe cannot even agree on the meaning of words.\" Setting aside the\r\ninjustice of forcing men to pay money for the support of what they\r\ndeemed religious error, it was \"most dangerous to admit that the\r\nmagistrate is to decide for God--for that is the plain meaning of the\r\nestablishment principle. Once admit that principle, and no curb can be\r\nset upon its operation. Who shall restrict what God has appointed? And\r\nthus the extent to which the conscience of men may be constrained, or\r\npersecution for truth's sake may be carried, depends entirely on the\r\nignorance or enlightenment of the civil magistrate. There is no safety\r\nout of the principle that religion is a matter entirely between man\r\nand his God, and that the whole duty of the magistrate is to secure\r\nevery one in the peaceful observance of it. Anything else leads to\r\noppression and injustice, but this can never lead to either.\"\r\n\r\nA notable part of the speech was a defence of free, non-sectarian\r\neducation. \"I can conceive,\" he said, \"nothing more unprincipled than\r\na scheme to array the youth of the province in sectarian bands--to\r\nteach them, from the cradle up, to know each other as Methodist boys,\r\nand Presbyterian boys, and Episcopal boys. Surely, surely, we have\r\nenough of this most wretched sectarianism in our churches without\r\ncarrying it further.\"\r\n\r\nTo protect themselves from interruption, the advocates of\r\nsecularization had taken advantage of a law which allowed them to\r\ndeclare their meeting as private, and exclude disturbers. Their\r\nopponents held another meeting in the adjoining market-place where by\r\nresolution they expressed indignation at the repeated attempts of \"a\r\nGodless association\" to stir up religious strife, and declared that\r\nthe purposes of the association, if carried out, would bring about not\r\nonly the severance of British connection, but socialism,\r\nrepublicanism, and infidelity. The horrified listeners were told how\r\nRousseau and Voltaire had corrupted France, how religion was\r\noverthrown and the naked Goddess of Reason set up as an object of\r\nworship. They were told that the clergy reserves were a gift to the\r\nnation from \"our good King George the Third.\" Abolish them and the\r\nBritish flag would refuse to float over anarchy and confusion.\r\nFinally, they were assured that they could thrash the St. Lawrence\r\nHall audience in a stand-up fight, but were nevertheless advised to go\r\nquietly home. This advice was apparently accepted in the spirit of the\r\nadmonition: \"Don't nail his ears to the pump,\" for the crowd\r\nimmediately marched to St. Lawrence Hall, cheering, groaning, and\r\nshouting. They were met by the mayor, two aldermen, and the chief\r\nconstable, and told that they could not be admitted. Stones and bricks\r\nwere thrown through the windows of the hall. The Riot Act was read by\r\nan alderman, and the British regiment then quartered in the town, the\r\n71st, was sent for. There was considerable delay in bringing the\r\ntroops, and in the meantime there was great disorder; persons leaving\r\nthe hall were assaulted, and the mayor was struck in the face with a\r\nstone and severely cut. A company of the 71st arrived at midnight,\r\nafter which the violence of the mob abated.[6]\r\n\r\nThe steps leading up to the settlement of the question may be briefly\r\nreferred to. In 1850 the Canadian parliament had asked for power to\r\ndispose of the reserves, with the understanding that emoluments\r\nderived by existing incumbents should be guaranteed during their\r\nlives. The address having been forwarded to England, Lord John Russell\r\ninformed the governor-general that a bill would be introduced in\r\ncompliance with the wish of the Canadian parliament. But in 1852 the\r\nRussell government resigned, and was succeeded by that of the Earl of\r\nDerby. Derby (Lord Stanley) had been colonial secretary in the Peel\r\ngovernment, which had shown a strong bias against Canadian\r\nself-government. Sir John Pakington declared that the advisers of Her\r\nMajesty were not inclined to aid in the diversion to other purposes of\r\nthe only public fund for the support of divine worship and religious\r\ninstruction in Canada, though they would entertain proposals for new\r\ndispositions of the fund. Hincks, who was then in England, protested\r\nvigorously against the disregard of the wishes of the Canadian people.\r\nWhen the legislature assembled in 1852, it carried, at his instance,\r\nan address to the Crown strongly upholding the Canadian demand. Brown\r\ncontended that the language was too strong and the action too weak. He\r\nmade a counter proposal, which found little support, that the Canadian\r\nparliament itself enact a measure providing for the sale of the clergy\r\nlands to actual settlers, and the appropriation of the funds for the\r\nmaintenance of common schools.\r\n\r\nWith the fall of the Derby administration in England, ended the\r\nopposition from that source to the Canadian demands. But Hincks, who\r\nhad firmly vindicated the right of the Canadian parliament to\r\nlegislate on the matter, now hesitated to use the power placed in his\r\nhands, and declared that legislation should be deferred until a new\r\nparliament had been chosen. The result was that the work of framing\r\nthe measure of settlement fell into the hands of John A. Macdonald,\r\nthe rising star of the Conservative party. The fund, after provision\r\nhad been made for the vested rights of incumbents, was turned over to\r\nthe municipalities.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] Instructions to Governor Murray, _Canadian Archives of 1904_, p.\r\n218.\r\n\r\n[4] Professor Shortt in the _Canadian Magazine_, September, 1901.\r\n\r\n[5] Durham's _Report on the Affairs of British North America_.\r\nMethuen's reprint, pp. 125, 126.\r\n\r\n[6] The _Globe_, July, 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nBROWN'S FIRST PARLIAMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1851 parliament was dissolved, and in September Mr.\r\nBrown received a requisition from the Reformers of Kent to stand as\r\ntheir candidate, one of the signatures being that of Alexander\r\nMackenzie, afterwards premier of Canada. In accepting the nomination\r\nhe said that he anticipated that he would be attacked as an enemy of\r\nthe Roman Catholic Church; that he cordially adhered to the principles\r\nof the Protestant reformation; that he objected to the Roman Catholic\r\nChurch trenching on the civil rights of the community, but that he\r\nwould be ashamed to advocate any principle or measure which would\r\nrestrict the liberty of any man, or deprive him on account of his\r\nfaith of any right or advantage enjoyed by his fellow-subjects. In his\r\nelection address he advocated religious equality, the entire\r\nseparation of Church and State, the secularization of the clergy\r\nreserves, the proceeds to go to national schools, which were thus to\r\nbe made free. He advocated, also, the building of a railway from\r\nQuebec to Windsor and Sarnia, the improvement of the canals and\r\nwaterways, reciprocity with the Maritime Provinces and the United\r\nStates, a commission for the reform of law procedure, the extension\r\nof the franchise and the reform of representation. Representation by\r\npopulation afterwards came to be the watchword of those who demanded\r\nthat Upper Canada should have a larger representation than Lower\r\nCanada; but as yet this question had not arisen definitely. The\r\npopulation of Upper Canada was nearly doubled between 1842 and 1851,\r\nbut it did not appear until 1852 that it had passed the lower province\r\nin population.\r\n\r\nThe advocacy of free schools was an important part of the platform.\r\nDuring the month of January, 1852, the _Globe_ contained frequent\r\narticles, reports of public meetings, and letters on the subject. It\r\nwas contended by some of the opponents of free schools that the poor\r\ncould obtain free education by pleading their poverty; but the _Globe_\r\nreplied that education should not be a matter of charity, but should\r\nbe regarded as a right, like the use of pavements. The matter was made\r\nan issue in the election of school trustees in several places, and in\r\nthe Toronto election the advocates of free schools were successful.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to note here that Brown's views on higher\r\neducation corresponded with his views on public schools. In each case\r\nhe opposed sectarian control, on the ground that it would dissipate\r\nthe energies of the people, and divide among half a dozen sects the\r\nmoney which might maintain one efficient system. These views were\r\nfully set forth in a speech made on February 25th, 1853, upon a bill\r\nintroduced by Mr. Hincks to amend the law relating to the University\r\nof Toronto. Brown denounced the measure as a surrender to the\r\nsectaries. There were two distinct ideas, he said, in regard to higher\r\neducation in Upper Canada. One was that a university must be connected\r\nwith a Church and under the management of the clergy, without whose\r\ncontrol infidelity would prevail. The Reform party, led by Mr. Baldwin\r\nand Mr. Hincks, had denounced these views as the mere clap-trap of\r\npriestcraft. They held that there should be one great literary and\r\nscientific institution, to which all Canadians might resort on equal\r\nterms. This position was founded, not on contempt for religion, but on\r\nrespect for religion, liberty, and conscience. \"To no one principle\r\ndoes the Liberal party owe so many triumphs as to that of\r\nnon-sectarian university education.\" Until 1843 Anglican control\r\nprevailed; then various unsuccessful efforts at compromise were made,\r\nand finally, in 1849, after twenty years of agitation, the desire of\r\nthe Liberal party was fulfilled, and a noble institute of learning\r\nestablished. This act alone would have entitled Robert Baldwin to the\r\nlasting gratitude of his countrymen.\r\n\r\nContinuing, Brown said that the Hincks bill was reactionary--that the\r\noriginal draft even contained a reference to the godless character of\r\nthe institution--that the plan would fritter away the endowment by\r\ndividing it among sects and among localities. He opposed the abolition\r\nof the faculties of law and medicine. Rightly directed, the study of\r\nlaw was ennobling, and jurists should receive an education which would\r\ngive them broad and generous views of the principles of justice. The\r\nendowment of the university ought to be sufficient to attract eminent\r\nteachers, and to encourage students by scholarships. \"We are laying\r\nthe foundations of a great political and social system. Our vote\r\nto-day may deeply affect, for good or evil, the future of the country.\r\nI adjure the House to pause ere destroying an institution which may\r\none day be among the chief glories of a great and wise people.\"\r\n\r\nBrown was elected by a good majority. The general result of the\r\nelection was favourable to the Hincks-Morin administration. A large\r\npart of the interval between the election and the first session of the\r\nnew parliament was spent by Mr. Hincks in England, where he made some\r\nprogress in the settlement of the clergy reserve question, and where\r\nhe also made arrangements for the building of the Grand Trunk Railway\r\nfrom Montreal westward through Upper Canada. Negotiations for the\r\nbuilding of the Intercolonial Railway, connecting Lower Canada with\r\nthe Maritime Provinces, fell through, and the enterprise was delayed\r\nfor some years.\r\n\r\nIt was a matter of some importance that the first parliament in which\r\nMr. Brown took part was held in the city of Quebec. He had entered on\r\na course which made Catholics and French-Canadians regard him as their\r\nenemy, and in Quebec French and Catholic influence was dominant. Brown\r\nfelt keenly the hostility of his surroundings, and there are frequent\r\nreferences in his speeches and in the correspondence of the _Globe_ to\r\nthe unfriendly faces in the gallery of the chamber, and to the social\r\npower exercised by the Church. \"Nothing,\" says the Hon. James Young,\r\n\"could exceed the courage and eloquence with which Brown stood up\r\nnight after night, demanding justice for Upper Canada in the face of a\r\nhostile majority on the floor of the chamber and still more hostile\r\nauditors in the galleries above. So high, indeed, did public feeling\r\nrun on some occasions that fears were entertained for his personal\r\nsafety, and his friends occasionally insisted after late and exciting\r\ndebates, lasting often till long after midnight, on accompanying\r\nhim.\"[7] Mr. Young adds that these fears were not shared by Mr. Brown,\r\nand that they proved to be groundless. Mr. Brown, in fact, did not\r\nregard the Quebec influence as a personal grievance, but he argued\r\nthat on public grounds the legislature ought not to meet in a city\r\nwhere freedom of speech might be impaired by local sentiment. That he\r\nharboured no malice was very finely shown when parliament met four\r\nyears afterwards in Toronto. He had just concluded a powerful speech.\r\nThe galleries were crowded, this time with a friendly audience, which\r\nat length broke into applause. Brown checked the demonstration. \"I\r\nhave addressed none,\" he said, \"but members of this House, and trust\r\nthat members from Lower Canada will not be overawed by any\r\nmanifestation of feeling in this chamber. I shall be ready on all\r\noccasions to discourage it. In Lower Canada I stood almost alone in\r\nsupporting my views, and I well know how painful these manifestations\r\nare to a stranger in a strange place. I do sincerely trust that\r\ngentlemen of French origin will feel as free to speak here as if they\r\nwere in Quebec.\"\r\n\r\nBrown made his maiden speech during the debate on the address. It is\r\ndescribed in a contemporary account as \"a terrible onslaught on the\r\ngovernment.\" An idea of violence conveyed in this and other comments\r\nwould appear to have been derived from the extreme energy of Brown's\r\ngestures. The printed report of the speech does not give that\r\nimpression. Though severe, it was in the main historical and\r\nargumentative. It contained a review of the political history of\r\nCanada from the time of the rupture between Metcalfe and his\r\nministers, up to the time when the principle of responsible government\r\nwas conceded. Brown argued that Reformers were bound to stand by that\r\nprinciple, and to accept all its obligations. In his judgment it was\r\nessential to the right working of responsible government that parties\r\nshould declare their principles clearly and stand or fall by them. If\r\nthey held one set of principles out of office and another set in\r\noffice they would reduce responsible government to a farce. He\r\nacknowledged the services which Hincks and Morin had rendered in\r\nfighting for responsible government; but he charged them with\r\nbetraying that principle by their own conduct in office. Two systems\r\nof government, he said, were being tested on this continent. The\r\nAmerican system contained checks and balances. The British system\r\ncould be carried on only by the observance of certain unwritten laws,\r\nand especially a strict good faith and adherence to principle. Brown,\r\nas a party man, adhered firmly to Burke's definition of party: \"A body\r\nof men united for promoting by their joint endeavours the national\r\ninterest, upon some particular principle on which they are all\r\nagreed.\" Office-holding, with him, was a minor consideration. \"There\r\nis no theory in the principle of responsible government more vital to\r\nits right working than that parties shall take their stand on the\r\nprominent questions of the day, and mount to office or resign it\r\nthrough the success or failure of principles to which they are\r\nattached. This is the great safeguard for the public against clap-trap\r\nprofessions.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] Young's _Public Men and Public Life in Canada_, p. 83.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nRISE OF BROWN'S INFLUENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of parties in the legislature was peculiar. The most\r\nformidable antagonist of the Reform government was the man who was\r\nrapidly rising to the leadership of the Reform party. The old Tory\r\nparty was dead, and its leader, Sir Allan MacNab, was almost inactive.\r\nMacdonald, who was to re-organize and lead the new Conservative party,\r\nwas playing a waiting game, taking advantage of Brown's tremendous\r\nblows at the ministry, and for the time being satisfied with a less\r\nprominent part in the conflict. Brown rapidly rose to a commanding\r\nposition in the assembly. He did this without any _finesse_ or skill\r\nin the management of men, with scarcely any assistance, and almost\r\nentirely by his own energy and force of conviction. His industry and\r\ncapacity for work were prodigious. He spoke frequently, and on a wide\r\nrange of subjects requiring careful study and mastery of facts. In the\r\ndivisions he obtained little support. He had antagonized the\r\nFrench-Canadians, the Clear Grits of Upper Canada were for the time\r\ndetermined to stand by the government, and his views were usually not\r\nsuch as the Conservatives could endorse, although they occasionally\r\nfollowed him in order to embarrass the government.\r\n\r\nBrown's course in parliament, however, was pointing to a far more\r\nimportant result than changes in the personnel of office-holders.\r\nHincks once told him that the logical conclusion of that course was\r\nthe dissolution of the union. There was a measure of truth in this. If\r\nhe had said dissolution or modification, he would have been absolutely\r\nright. Between the ideas of Upper Canada and Lower Canada there was a\r\ndifference so great that a legislative union was foredoomed to\r\nfailure, and separation could be avoided only by a federation which\r\nallowed each community to take its own way. Brown did not create these\r\ndifficulties, but he emphasized them, and so forced and hastened the\r\napplication of the remedy. Up to the time of his entering parliament,\r\nhis policy had related mainly to Upper Canada. In parliament, however,\r\na mass of legislation emanating from Lower Canada aroused his strong\r\nopposition. In the main it was ecclesiastical legislation\r\nincorporating Roman Catholic institutions, giving them power to hold\r\nlands, to control education, and otherwise to strengthen the authority\r\nof the Church over the people. It is not necessary to discuss these\r\nmeasures in detail. The object is to arrive at Brown's point of view,\r\nand it was this: That the seat of government was a Catholic city, and\r\nthat legislation and administration were largely controlled by the\r\nFrench-Canadian priesthood. He complained that Upper Canada was\r\nunfairly treated in regard to legislation and expenditure; that its\r\npublic opinion was disregarded, and that it was not fairly\r\nrepresented. The question of representation steadily assumed more\r\nimportance in his mind, and he finally came to the conclusion that\r\nrepresentation by population was the true remedy for all the\r\ngrievances of which he complained. Lower Canada, being now numerically\r\nthe weaker, naturally clung to the system which gave it equality of\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nIn all these matters the breach between George Brown and the Lower\r\nCanadian representatives was widening, while he was becoming more and\r\nmore the voice of Upper Canadian opinion. When, in the intervals\r\nbetween parliamentary sessions, he visited various places in Upper\r\nCanada, he found himself the most popular man in the community. He\r\naddressed great public meetings. Banquets were given in his honour.\r\nThe prominent part taken by ministers of the Gospel at these\r\ngatherings illustrates at once the weakness and the strength of his\r\nposition. He satisfied the \"Nonconformist conscience\" of Upper Canada\r\nby his advocacy not only of religious equality but of the prohibition\r\nof the liquor traffic and of the cessation of Sunday labour by public\r\nservants. But this very attitude made it difficult for him to work\r\nwith any political party in Lower Canada.\r\n\r\nIn 1853 there was a remarkable article in the Cobourg _Star_, a\r\nConservative journal, illustrating the hold which Brown had obtained\r\nupon Upper Canadian sentiment. This attitude was called forth by a\r\nbanquet given to Brown by the Reformers of the neighbourhood. It\r\nexpressed regret that the honour was given on party grounds. \"Had it\r\nbeen given on the ground of his services to Protestantism, it would\r\nhave brought out every Orangeman in the country. Conservatives\r\ndisagreed with Brown about the clergy reserves, but if the reserves\r\nmust be secularized, every Conservative in Canada would join Brown in\r\nhis crusade against Roman Catholic endowments.\" Then follows this\r\nestimate of Brown's character: \"In George Brown we see no agitator or\r\ndemagogue, but the strivings of common sense, a sober will to attain\r\nthe useful, the practical and the needful. He has patient courage,\r\nstubborn endurance, and obstinate resistance, and desperate daring in\r\nattacking what he believes to be wrong and in defending what he\r\nbelieves to be right. There is no cant or parade or tinsel or\r\nclap-trap about him. He takes his stand against open, palpable,\r\ntangible wrongs, against the tyranny which violates men's roofs, and\r\nthe intolerance which vexes their consciences. True, he is wrong on\r\nthe reserves question, but then he is honest, we know where to find\r\nhim. He does not, like some of our Reformers, give us to understand\r\nthat he will support us and then turn his back. He does not slip the\r\nword of promise to the ear and then break it to the lips. Leaving the\r\nreserves out of the question, George Brown is eminently conservative\r\nin his spirit. His leading principle, as all his writings will show,\r\nis to reconcile progress with preservation, change with stability, the\r\nalteration of incidents with the maintenance of essentials. Change,\r\nfor the sake of change, agitation for vanity, for applause or\r\nmischief, he has contemptuously repudiated. He is not like the Clear\r\nGrit, a republican of the first water, but on the contrary looks to\r\nthe connection with the mother country, not as fable or unreality or\r\nfleeting vision, but as alike our interest and our duty, as that which\r\nshould ever be our beacon, our guide and our goal.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1853 the relative strength of Brown and the ministers was tested in\r\na series of demonstrations held throughout Canada. The Hon. James\r\nYoung gives a vivid description of Brown as he appeared at a banquet\r\ngiven in his honour at Galt: \"He was a striking figure. Standing fully\r\nsix feet two inches high, with a well-proportioned body, well balanced\r\nhead and handsome face, his appearance not only indicated much mental\r\nand physical strength, but conveyed in a marked manner an impression\r\nof youthfulness and candour. These impressions deepened as his address\r\nproceeded, and his features grew animated and were lighted up by his\r\nfine expressive eyes.\" His voice was strong and soft, with a\r\nwell-marked Edinburgh accent. His appearance surprised the people who\r\nhad expected to see an older and sterner-looking man. His first\r\nremarks were disappointing; as was usual with him he stammered and\r\nhesitated until he warmed to his subject, when he spoke with such an\r\narray of facts and figures, such earnestness and enthusiasm, that he\r\neasily held the audience for three hours.[8]\r\n\r\nOn October 1st, 1853, the _Globe_ was first issued as a daily. It was\r\nthen stated that the paper was first published as a weekly paper with\r\na circulation of three hundred. On November 1st, 1846, it was\r\npublished twice a week with a circulation of two thousand, which rose\r\nto a figure between three thousand and four thousand. In July, 1849,\r\nit was issued three times a week. When the daily paper was first\r\npublished the circulation was six thousand. To anticipate a little, it\r\nmay be said that in 1855 the _Globe_ absorbed the _North American_ and\r\nthe _Examiner_, and the combined circulation was said to be sixteen\r\nthousand four hundred and thirty-six. The first daily paper contained\r\na declaration of principles, including the entire separation of Church\r\nand State, the abolition of the clergy reserves and the restoration of\r\nthe lands to the public, cessation of grants of public money for\r\nsectarian purposes, the abolition of tithes and other compulsory\r\ntaxation for ecclesiastical purposes, and restraint on land-holding by\r\necclesiastical corporations.\r\n\r\nAn extract from this statement of policy may be given:\r\n\r\n\"Representation by population. Justice for Upper Canada! While Upper\r\nCanada has a larger population by one hundred and fifty thousand than\r\nLower Canada, and contributes more than double the amount of taxation\r\nto the general revenue, Lower Canada has an equal number of\r\nrepresentatives in parliament.\r\n\r\n\"National education.--Common school, grammar school, and collegiate\r\nfree from sectarianism and open to all on equal terms. Earnest war\r\nwill be waged with the separate school system, which has unfortunately\r\nobtained a footing.\r\n\r\n\"A prohibitory liquor law.--Any measure which will alleviate the\r\nfrightful evils of intemperance.\"\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of prohibition on this platform was the natural result\r\nof the drinking habits of that day. In a pamphlet issued by the Canada\r\nCompany for the information of intending immigrants, whiskey was\r\ndescribed as \"a cheap and wholesome beverage.\" Its cheapness and\r\nabundance caused it to be used in somewhat the same way as the \"small\r\nbeer\" of England, and it was a common practice to order a jug from the\r\ngrocer along with the food supply of the family. When a motion\r\nfavouring prohibition was introduced in the Canadian parliament there\r\nwere frequent references to the convivial habits of the members. The\r\nseconder of the motion was greeted with loud laughter. He\r\ngood-naturedly said that he was well aware of the cause of hilarity,\r\nbut that he was ready to sacrifice his pleasure to the general good.\r\nSir Allan MacNab, the leader of the Opposition, moved a farcical\r\namendment, under which every member was to sign a pledge of\r\nabstinence, and to be disqualified if he broke it. Brown made an\r\nearnest speech in favour of the motion, in which he remarked that\r\nCanada then contained nine hundred and thirty-one whiskey shops,\r\nfifty-eight steamboat bars, three thousand four hundred and thirty\r\ntaverns, one hundred and thirty breweries, and one hundred and\r\nthirty-five distilleries.\r\n\r\nThe marked diminution of intemperance in the last fifty years may be\r\nattributed in part to restrictive laws, and in part to the work of the\r\ntemperance societies, which rivalled the taverns in social\r\nattractions, and were effective agents of moral suasion.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Young, _op. cit._, pp. 58, 59.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION OF PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn June, 1854, the Hincks-Morin government was defeated in the\r\nlegislature on a vote of censure for delay in dealing with the\r\nquestion of the clergy reserves. A combination of Tories and Radicals\r\ndeprived Hincks of all but five of his Upper Canadian supporters.\r\nParliament was immediately dissolved, and the ensuing election was a\r\n_mêlée_ in which Hincks Reformers, Brown Reformers, Tories and Clear\r\nGrits were mingled in confusion. Brown was returned for Lambton, where\r\nhe defeated the Hon. Malcolm Cameron, postmaster-general under Hincks.\r\nThe Reform party was in a large majority in the new legislature, and\r\nif united could have controlled it with ease. But the internal quarrel\r\nwas irreconcilable. Hincks was defeated by a combination of Tories and\r\ndissatisfied Reformers, and a general reconstruction of parties\r\nfollowed. Sir Allan MacNab, as leader of the Conservative opposition,\r\nformed an alliance with the French-Canadian members of the Hincks\r\ngovernment and with some of its Upper Canadian supporters. Hincks\r\nretired, but gave his support to the new combination, \"being of\r\nopinion that the combination of parties by which the new government\r\nwas supported presented the only solution of the difficulties caused\r\nby a coalition of parties holding no sentiments in common, a coalition\r\nwhich rarely takes place in England. I deemed it my duty to give my\r\nsupport to that government during the short period that I continued in\r\npublic life.\"[9]\r\n\r\nWhether the MacNab-Morin government was a true coalition or a Tory\r\ncombination under that name was a question fiercely debated at that\r\ntime. It certainly did not stand for the Toryism that had resisted\r\nresponsible government, the secularization of the clergy reserves, and\r\nthe participation of French-Canadians in the government of the\r\ncountry. It had at first some of the elements of a coalition, but it\r\ngradually came to represent Conservatism and the personal ascendency\r\nof John A. Macdonald. Robert Baldwin, from his retirement, gave his\r\napproval to the combination, and hence arose the \"Baldwin Reformer,\"\r\nblessed as a convert by one party, and cursed as a renegade by the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nReconstruction on one side was followed by reconstruction on the\r\nother. Upper Canadian Reformers rallied round Brown, and an alliance\r\nwas formed with the Quebec Rouges. This was a natural alliance of\r\nradical Reformers in both provinces. Some light is thrown on it by an\r\narticle published in the _Globe_ in 1855. The writer said that in\r\n1849, some young men of Montreal, fresh from the schools and filled\r\nto the brim with the Republican opinions which had spread from France\r\nthroughout all Europe, formed associations and established newspapers\r\nadvocating extreme political views. They declaimed in favour of\r\nliberty and against priestcraft and tyranny with all the ardour and\r\nfreshness of youth. Their talents and the evident purity and sincerity\r\nof their motives made a strong impression on their countrymen,\r\ncontrasting as they did with the selfishness and mediocrity of other\r\nFrench-Canadian leaders, and the result was that the Rouge party was\r\ngrowing in strength both in the House and in the country. With the\r\ngrowth of strength there had come a growing sense of responsibility,\r\ngreater moderation and prudence. In the legislature, at least, the\r\nRouges had not expressed a single sentiment on general policy to which\r\na British constitutional Reformer might not assent. They were the true\r\nallies of the Upper Canadian Reformers, and in fact the only Liberals\r\namong the French-Canadians. They had Reform principles, they\r\nmaintained a high standard of political morality. They stood for the\r\nadvance of education and for liberty of speech. They were the hope of\r\nCanada, and their attitude gave promise that a brighter day was about\r\nto dawn on the political horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was unreasonable to expect that the Liberals could continue to\r\nreceive that solid support from Lower Canada which they had received\r\nin the days of the Baldwin-Lafontaine alliance. In those days the\r\nissue was whether French-Canadians should be allowed to take part in\r\nthe government of the country, or should be excluded as rebels. The\r\nReformers championed their cause and received the solid support of the\r\nFrench-Canadian people. But when once the principle for which they\r\ncontested was conceded, it was perceived that Lower Canada, like Upper\r\nCanada, had its Conservative element, and party lines were formed. Mr.\r\nBrown held that there could be no lasting alliance between Upper\r\nCanadian Reformers and Lower Canadian Conservatives, and especially\r\nwith those Lower Canadians who defended the power and privileges of\r\nthe Church. He was perfectly willing that electors holding these views\r\nshould go to the Conservative party, which was their proper place. The\r\nRouges could not bring to the Liberal party the numerical strength of\r\nthe supporters of Lafontaine, but as they really held Liberal\r\nprinciples, the alliance was solidly based and was more likely to\r\nendure.\r\n\r\nThe leader of the Rouges was A. A. Dorion, a distinguished advocate,\r\nand a man of culture, refinement and eloquence. He was Brown's\r\ndesk-mate, and while in physique and manner the two were strongly\r\ncontrasted, they were drawn together by the chivalry and devotion to\r\nprinciple which characterized both, and they formed a strong\r\nfriendship. \"For four years,\" said Mr. Brown, in a public address, \"I\r\nacted with him in the ranks of the Opposition, learned to value most\r\nhighly the uprightness of his character, the liberality of his\r\nopinions, and the firmness of his convictions. On most questions of\r\npublic general policy we heartily agreed, and regularly voted\r\ntogether; on the questions that divided all Upper Canadians and all\r\nLower Canadians alone we differed, and on these we had held many\r\nearnest consultations from year to year with a view to their removal,\r\nwithout arriving at the conviction that when we had the opportunity we\r\ncould find the mode.\" Their habit was not to attempt to conceal these\r\nsectional differences, but to recognize them frankly with a view to\r\nfinding the remedy. It was rarely that either presented a resolution\r\nto the House without asking the advice of the other. They knew each\r\nother's views perfectly, and on many questions, especially of commerce\r\nand finance, they were in perfect accord.\r\n\r\nBy this process of evolution Liberals and Conservatives were restored\r\nto their proper and historic places, and the way was cleared for new\r\nissues. These issues arose out of the ill-advised attempt to join\r\nUpper and Lower Canada in a legislative union. A large part of the\r\nhistory of this period is the history of an attempt to escape the\r\nconsequences of that blunder. This was the reason why every ministry\r\nhad its double name--the Lafontaine-Baldwin, the Hincks-Morin, the\r\nTaché-Macdonald, the Brown-Dorion, the Macdonald-Sicotte. This was the\r\nreason why every ministry had its attorney-general east for Lower\r\nCanada and its attorney-general west for Upper Canada. In his speech\r\non confederation Sir John Macdonald said that although the union was\r\nlegislative in name, it was federal in fact--that in matters affecting\r\nUpper Canada alone, Upper Canadian members claimed and usually\r\nexercised, exclusive power, and so with Lower Canada. The consolidated\r\nstatutes of Canada and the consolidated statutes of Upper Canada must\r\nbe sought in separate volumes. The practice of legislating for one\r\nprovince alone was not confined to local or private matters. For\r\ninstance, as the two communities had widely different ideas as to\r\nSabbath observance, the stricter law was enacted for Upper Canada\r\nalone. Hence also arose the theory of the double majority--that a\r\nministry must, for the support of its general policy, have a majority\r\nfrom each province.\r\n\r\nBut all these shifts and devices could not stay the agitation for a\r\nradical remedy. Some Reformers proposed to dissolve the union. Brown\r\nbelieved that the difficulty would be solved by representation by\r\npopulation, concerning which a word of explanation is necessary. When\r\nthe provinces were united in 1841, the population of Lower Canada\r\nexceeded that of Upper Canada in the proportion of three to two. \"If,\"\r\nsaid Lord Durham, \"the population of Upper Canada is rightly estimated\r\nat four hundred thousand, the English inhabitants of Lower Canada at\r\none hundred and fifty thousand, and the French at four hundred and\r\nfifty thousand, the union of the two provinces would not only give a\r\nclear English majority, but one which would be increased every year by\r\nthe influence of English emigration, and I have little doubt that the\r\nFrench, when once placed by the legitimate course of events in a\r\nminority, would abandon their vain hopes of nationality.\" But he added\r\nthat he was averse to every plan that had been proposed for giving an\r\nequal number of members to the two provinces. The object could be\r\nattained without any violation of the principles of representation,\r\nsuch as would antagonize public opinion, and \"when emigration shall\r\nhave increased the English population of the Upper Province, the\r\nadoption of such a principle would operate to defeat the very purpose\r\nit is intended to serve. It appears to me that any such electoral\r\narrangement, founded on the present provincial divisions, would tend\r\nto defeat the purpose of union and perpetuate the idea of disunion.\"\r\n\r\nCounsels less wise and just prevailed, and the united province was\r\n\"gerrymandered\" against Lord Durham's protest. Lower Canada complained\r\nof the injustice, and with good reason. In the course of time Lord\r\nDurham's prediction was fulfilled; by immigration the population of\r\nUpper Canada overtook and passed that of Lower Canada. The census of\r\n1852 gave Upper Canada a population of nine hundred and fifty-two\r\nthousand, and Lower Canada a population of eight hundred and ninety\r\nthousand two hundred and sixty-one. Brown began to press for\r\nrepresentation by population. He was met by two objections. It was\r\nargued on behalf of the French-Canadians that they had submitted to\r\nthe injustice while they had the larger population, and that the Upper\r\nCanadians ought to follow their example. Mr. Brown admitted the force\r\nof this argument, but he met it by showing that the Lower Canadians\r\nhad been under-represented for eight years, and that by the time the\r\nnew representation went into force, the Upper Canadians would have\r\nsuffered injustice for about an equal term, so that a balance might be\r\nstruck. A more formidable objection was raised by Mr. Hincks, who said\r\nthat the union was in the nature of a compact between two nations\r\nhaving widely different institutions; that the basis of the compact\r\nwas equal representation, and that Brown's proposition would destroy\r\nthat basis. Cartier said that representation by population could not\r\nbe had without repeal of the union. The French-Canadians were afraid\r\nthat they would be swamped, and would be obliged to accept the laws\r\nand institutions of the majority.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to deny the force of these objections. In 1841 Lower\r\nCanada had been compelled to join a union in which the voting power of\r\nUpper Canada was arbitrarily increased. If this was due to distrust,\r\nto fear of \"French domination,\" French-Canadians could not be blamed\r\nfor showing an equal distrust of English domination, and for refusing\r\nto give up the barrier which, as they believed, protected their\r\npeculiar institutions. Ultimately the solution was found in the\r\napplication of the federal system, giving unity in matters requiring\r\ncommon action, and freedom to differ in matters of local concern.\r\nTowards this solution events were tending, and the importance of\r\nBrown's agitation for representation by population, which gained\r\nimmense force in Upper Canada, lies in its relation to the larger plan\r\nof confederation.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[9] Hincks's _Political History of Canada_, p. 80.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nSOME PERSONAL POLITICS\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the burning of the parliament buildings in Montreal the seat of\r\ngovernment oscillated between Quebec and Toronto. Toronto's turn came\r\nin the session of 1856. Macdonald was now the virtual, and was on the\r\npoint of becoming the titular, leader of the party. Brown was equally\r\nconspicuous on the other side. During the debate on the address he was\r\nthe central figure in a fierce struggle, and some one with a turn for\r\nstatistics said that his name was mentioned three hundred and\r\nseventy-two times. The air was stimulating, and Brown's contribution\r\nto the debate was not of a character to turn away wrath.\r\n\r\nSmarting under Brown's attack, Macdonald suddenly gave a new turn to\r\nthe debate. He charged that Brown, while acting as a member and\r\nsecretary of a commission appointed by the Lafontaine-Baldwin\r\ngovernment to inquire into the condition of the provincial\r\npenitentiary, had falsified testimony, suborned convicts to commit\r\nperjury, and obtained the pardon of murderers to induce them to give\r\nfalse evidence. Though the assembly had by this time become accustomed\r\nto hard hitting, this outbreak created a sensation. Brown gave an\r\nindignant denial to the charges, and announced that he would move for\r\na committee of inquiry. He was angrily interrupted by the\r\nsolicitor-general, who flung the lie across the House. The\r\nsolicitor-general was a son of the warden of the penitentiary who had\r\nbeen dismissed in consequence of the report of the commission.\r\nMacdonald was a strong personal friend of the warden, and had\r\nattempted some years before to bring his case before the assembly.\r\nBrown promptly moved for the committee, and it was not long before he\r\npresented that tribunal with a dramatic surprise. It was supposed that\r\nthe report of the penitentiary committee had been burned, and the\r\nattack on Brown was made upon that supposition. When Mr. Brown was\r\ncalled as a witness, however, he produced the original report with all\r\nthe evidence, and declared that it had never been out of his\r\npossession \"for one hour.\" The effect of this disclosure on his\r\nassailants is shown in a letter addressed to the committee by\r\nVanKoughnet, Macdonald's counsel: \"Mr. Macdonald,\" he said, \"had been\r\ngetting up his case on the assumption and belief that these minutes\r\nhad been destroyed and could not be procured, and much of the labour\r\nhe had been allowed to go to by Mr. Brown for that purpose would now\r\nbe thrown away; the whole manner of giving evidence, etc., would now\r\nbe altered.\"\r\n\r\nThe graver charges of subornation of perjury etc., were abandoned, and\r\nMacdonald's friends confined themselves to an attempt to prove that\r\nthe inquiry had been unfairly conducted, that the warden had been\r\nharshly treated, and the testimony not fairly reported. It was a\r\npolitical committee with a Conservative majority, and the majority,\r\ngiving up all hope of injuring Brown, bent its energies to saving\r\nMacdonald from the consequences of his reckless violence. The Liberal\r\nmembers asked for a complete exoneration of Mr. Brown. A supporter of\r\nthe government was willing to exonerate Brown if Macdonald were\r\nallowed to escape without censure. A majority of the committee,\r\nhowever, took refuge in a rambling deliverance, which was sharply\r\nattacked in the legislature. Sir Allan MacNab bluntly declared that\r\nthe charge had been completely disproved, and that the committee ought\r\nto have had the manliness to say so. Drummond, a member of the\r\ngovernment, also said that the attack had failed. The accusers were\r\nwilling to allow the matter to drop, and as a matter of fact the\r\nreport was never put to a vote. But Mr. Brown would not allow them to\r\nescape so easily. Near the close of the session he made a speech which\r\ngave a new character to the discussion. Up to this time it had been a\r\npersonal question between Brown and his assailants. Brown dealt with\r\nthis aspect of the matter briefly but forcibly. He declared that not\r\nonly his conduct but the character of the other commissioners was\r\nfully vindicated, and that a conspiracy to drive him from public life\r\nhad signally failed. Conservative members had met him and admitted\r\nthat there was no truth in the charges, but had pleaded that they must\r\ngo with the party. Members had actually been asked to \"pair\" off on\r\nthe question of upholding or destroying his character, before they had\r\nheard his defence.\r\n\r\nFrom these personal matters he returned to the abuses that had been\r\ndiscovered by the commission. A terrible story of neglect and cruelty\r\nwas told. These charges did not rest on the testimony of prisoners.\r\nThey were sustained by the evidence of officers and by the records of\r\nthe institution. \"If,\" said the speaker, \"every word of the witnesses\r\ncalled by the commissioners were struck out, and the case left to rest\r\non the testimony of the warden's own witnesses and the official\r\nrecords of the prison, there would be sufficient to establish the\r\nblackest record of wickedness that ever disgraced a civilized\r\ncountry.\" Amid applause, expressions of amazement and cries of\r\n\"Shame!\" from the galleries, Brown told of the abuses laid bare by the\r\nprison commission. He told of prisoners fed with rotten meal and bread\r\ninfested with maggots; of children beaten with cat and rawhide for\r\nchildish faults; of a coffin-shaped box in which men and even women\r\nwere made to stand or rather crouch, their limbs cramped, and their\r\nlungs scantily supplied with air from a few holes. Brown's speech\r\nvirtually closed the case, although Macdonald strove to prove that\r\nthe accounts of outrages were exaggerated, that the warden, Smith, was\r\nhimself a kind-hearted man, and that he had been harshly treated by\r\nthe commissioners.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written about this time, Macdonald said that he was\r\ncarrying on a war against Brown, that he would prove him a most\r\ndishonest, dishonourable fellow, \"and in doing so I will only pay him\r\na debt that I owe him for abusing me for months together in his\r\nnewspaper.\"[10] Whatever the provocation may have been, the personal\r\nrelations of the two men were further embittered by this incident.\r\n\r\nEight years afterwards they were members of the coalition ministry by\r\nwhich confederation was brought about, and Brown's intimate friend,\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, says that the association was most distasteful to\r\nBrown, on account of the charges made in connection with the prison\r\ncommission. That the leaders of the two parties were not merely\r\npolitical opponents but personal enemies must have embittered the\r\nparty struggle; and it was certainly waged on both sides with fury,\r\nand with little regard either for the amenities of life or for fair\r\nplay.\r\n\r\nHis work on the commission gave Brown a strong interest in prison\r\nreform. While the work of the commission was fresh in his mind he\r\ndelivered an address in the Toronto Mechanics' Institute, in which he\r\nsketched the history of prison reform in England and the United\r\nStates, and pointed out how backward Canada was in this phase of\r\ncivilization. He pleaded for a more charitable treatment of those on\r\nwhom the prison doors had closed. There were inmates of prisons who\r\nwould stand guiltless in the presence of Him who searches the heart.\r\nThere were guilty ones outside. We cannot, he said, expect human\r\njustice to be infallible; but we must not draw a hard and fast line\r\nbetween the world inside the prison and the world outside, as if the\r\ncourts of justice had the divine power of judging between good and\r\nevil. In Canada, he said, we have no system of reforming the prisoner;\r\neven the chaplain or the teacher never enters the prison walls.\r\n\"Children of eight and ten years of age are placed in our gaols,\r\nsurrounded by hundreds of the worst criminals in the province.\" He\r\nwent on to describe some of the evils of herding together hardened\r\ncriminals, children, and persons charged with trifling offences. He\r\nadvocated government inspection of prisons, a uniform system of\r\ndiscipline, strict classification and separation, secular and\r\nreligious instruction, and the teaching of trades. The prisoner should\r\nbe punished, but not made to feel that he was being degraded by\r\nsociety for the sake of revenge. Hope should be held out to those who\r\nshowed repentance. The use of the lash for trifling offences against\r\ndiscipline was condemned. On the whole, his views were such as are\r\nnow generally accepted, and he may be regarded as one of the pioneers\r\nof prison reform in Canada.\r\n\r\nThe habit of personal attack was further illustrated in the charge,\r\nfrequently made by Mr. Brown's enemies, that he had been a defaulter\r\nin Scotland. The _North American_ had printed this accusation during\r\nits fierce altercation with the _Globe_, but the editor, Mr.\r\nMacdougall, had afterwards apologized, and explained that it had crept\r\ninto the paper during his absence and without his knowledge. In the\r\nsession of 1858, a Mr. Powell, member for Carleton, renewed the attack\r\nin the House, and Mr. Brown made a reply of such compelling human\r\ninterest that not a word can be added or taken away. He said: \"This is\r\nnot the first time that the insinuation has been made that I was a\r\ndefaulter in my native city. It has been echoed before now from the\r\norgans of the ministry, and at many an election contest have I been\r\ncompelled to sit patiently and hear the tale recounted in the ears of\r\nassembled hundreds. For fifteen years I have been compelled to bear in\r\nsilence these imputations. I would that I could yet refrain from the\r\npainful theme, but the pointed and public manner in which the charge\r\nhas now been made, and the fear that the public cause with which I am\r\nidentified might suffer by my silence, alike tell me that the moment\r\nhas come when I ought to explain the transaction, as I have always\r\nbeen able to explain it, and to cast back the vile charge of\r\ndishonesty on those who dared to make it. That my father was a\r\nmerchant in the city of Edinburgh, and that he engaged in disastrous\r\nbusiness speculations commencing in the inflated times of 1825 and\r\n1826, terminating ten years afterwards in his failure, is undoubtedly\r\ntrue. And it is, unhappily, also true, that he did hold a public\r\noffice, and that funds connected with that office were, at the moment\r\nof his sequestration, mixed up with his private funds, to the extent,\r\nI believe, of two thousand eight hundred pounds. For this sum four\r\nrelatives and friends were sureties, and they paid the money. Part of\r\nthat money has been repaid; every sixpence of it will be paid, and\r\npaid shortly. Property has been long set aside for the payment of that\r\ndebt to its utmost farthing. My father felt that while that money\r\nremained unpaid there was a brand on himself and his family, and he\r\nhas wrought, wrought as few men have wrought, to pay off, not only\r\nthat, but other obligations of a sacred character. Many a bill of\r\nexchange, the proceeds of his labour, has he sent to old creditors who\r\nwere in need of what he owed. For myself, sir, I have felt equally\r\nbound with my father; as his eldest son I felt that the fruits of my\r\nindustry should stand pledged until every penny of those debts was\r\npaid and the honour of my family vindicated. An honourable member\r\nopposite, whom I regret to hear cheering on the person who made the\r\nattack, might have known that, under the legal advice of his\r\nrelative, I long ago secured that in the event of my death before the\r\naccomplishment of our long-cherished purpose, after the payment of my\r\nown obligations, the full discharge of those sacred debts of my father\r\nshould stand as a first charge on my ample estate. Debts, sir, which I\r\nwas no more bound in law to pay than any gentleman who hears me. For\r\nthe painful transaction to which I have been forced to allude, I am no\r\nmore responsible than any gentleman in this assembly. It happened in\r\n1836; I was at that time but seventeen years of age, I was totally\r\nunconnected with it, but, young as I was, I felt then, as I feel now,\r\nthe obligation it laid upon me, and I vowed that I should never rest\r\nuntil every penny had been paid. There are those present who have\r\nknown my every action since I set foot in this country; they know I\r\nhave not eaten the bread of idleness, but they did not know the great\r\nobject of my labour. The one end of my desire for wealth was that I\r\nmight discharge those debts and redeem my father's honour. Thank God,\r\nsir, my exertions have not been in vain. Thank God, sir, I have long\r\npossessed property far more than sufficient for all my desires. But,\r\nas those gentlemen know, it is one thing in this country to have\r\nproperty, and another to be able to withdraw a large sum of money from\r\na business in active operation; and many a night have I laid my head\r\non my pillow after a day of toil, estimating and calculating if the\r\ntime had yet arrived, when, with justice to those to whom I stood\r\nindebted, and without fear of embarrassment resulting, I might venture\r\nto carry out the purpose of my life. I have been accused of being\r\nambitious; I have been charged with aspiring to the office of prime\r\nminister of this great country and of lending all my energies to the\r\nattainment of that end; but I only wish I could make my opponents\r\nunderstand how infinitely surpassing all this, how utterly petty and\r\ncontemptible in my thoughts have been all such considerations, in\r\ncomparison with the one longing desire to discharge those debts of\r\nhonour and vindicate those Scottish principles that have been\r\ninstilled into me since my youth. The honourable member for Cornwall\r\n[John Sandfield Macdonald] is well aware that every word I have spoken\r\nto-night has been long ago told him in private confidence, and he\r\nknows, too, that last summer I was rejoicing in the thought that I was\r\nat last in a position to visit my native land with the large sum\r\nnecessary for all the objects I contemplated, and that I was only\r\nprevented from doing so by the financial storm which swept over the\r\ncontinent. Such, sir, are the circumstances upon which this attack is\r\nfounded. Such the facts on which I have been denounced as a public\r\ndefaulter and refugee from my native land. But why, asked the person\r\nwho made the charge, has he sat silent under it? Why if the thing is\r\nfalse has he endured it so many years? What, sir, free myself from\r\nblame by inculpating one so dear! Say 'It was not I who was in fault,\r\nit was my father'? Rather would I have lost my right arm than utter\r\nsuch a word! No, sir, I waited the time when the charge could be met\r\nas it only might be fittingly met; and my only regret even now is that\r\nI have been compelled to speak before those debts have been entirely\r\nliquidated. But it is due, sir, to my aged father that I explain that\r\nit has not been with his will that these imputations have been so long\r\npointed at me, and that it has only been by earnest remonstrance that\r\nI have prevented his vindicating me in public long ere now. No man in\r\nToronto, perhaps, is more generally known in the community, and I\r\nthink I could appeal even to his political opponents to say if there\r\nis a citizen of Toronto at this day more thoroughly respected and\r\nesteemed. With a full knowledge of all that has passed, and all the\r\nconsequences that have flowed from a day of weakness, I will say that\r\nan honester man does not breathe the air of heaven; that no son feels\r\nprouder of his father than I do to-day; and that I would have\r\nsubmitted to the obloquy and reproach of his every act, not fifteen\r\nyears, but fifty--ay, have gone down to the grave with the cold shade\r\nof the world upon me, rather than that one of his gray hairs should\r\nhave been injured.\"\r\n\r\nPublic opinion was strongly influenced in Mr. Brown's favour by this\r\nincident. \"The entire address,\" said a leading Conservative paper next\r\nday, \"forms the most refreshing episode which the records of the\r\nCanadian House of Commons possess. Every true-hearted man must feel\r\nproud of one who has thus chivalrously done battle for his gray-haired\r\nsire. We speak deliberately when asserting that George Brown's\r\nposition in the country is at this moment immeasurably higher than it\r\never previously has been. And though our political creed be\r\ndiametrically antipodal to his own, we shall ever hail him as a credit\r\nto the land we love so well.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] Pope's _Memoirs of Sir John Macdonald_, p. 161.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE \"DOUBLE SHUFFLE\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBy his advocacy of representation by population, by his opposition to\r\nseparate schools, and his championship of Upper Canadian rights, Mr.\r\nBrown gained a remarkable hold upon the people. In the general\r\nelections of 1857 he was elected for the city of Toronto, in company\r\nwith Mr. Robinson, a Conservative. The election of a Liberal in\r\nToronto is a rare event, and there is no doubt that Mr. Brown's\r\nviolent conflict with the Roman Catholic Church contributed to his\r\nvictory, if it was not the main cause thereof. His party also made\r\nlarge gains through Upper Canada, and had a large majority in that\r\npart of the province, so that the majority for the Macdonald\r\ngovernment was drawn entirely from Lower Canada. Gross election frauds\r\noccurred in Russell county, where names were copied into the\r\npoll-books from old directories of towns in the state of New York, and\r\nof Quebec city, where such names as Julius Caesar, Napoleon Bonaparte,\r\nJudas Iscariot and George Washington appeared on the lists. The\r\nReformers attacked these elections in parliament without success, but\r\nin 1859 the sitting member for Russell and several others were tried\r\nfor conspiracy, convicted and sentenced to imprisonment. That the\r\ngovernment felt itself to be much weakened throughout the country is\r\nevident from Mr. John A. Macdonald's unsuccessful effort to add\r\nanother to his list of political combinations by detaching Mr. John\r\nSandfield Macdonald from the Reform party, offering seats in the\r\ncabinet to him and another Reformer. The personal attack on Mr. Brown\r\nin the session of 1858 has already been mentioned. The chief political\r\nevent of the session was the \"Double Shuffle.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 28th, 1858, Mr. Brown succeeded in placing the ministry in a\r\nminority on the question of the seat of government. Unable to decide\r\nbetween the conflicting claims of Toronto, Quebec, Montreal and\r\nKingston, the government referred the question to the queen, who\r\ndecided in favour of Ottawa. Brown had opposed the reference to the\r\nqueen, holding that the question should be settled in Canada. He also\r\nbelieved that the seat of government should not be fixed until\r\nrepresentation by population was granted, and all matters in dispute\r\nbetween Upper and Lower Canada arranged. He now moved against Ottawa\r\nand carried his motion. During the same sitting the government was\r\nsustained on a motion to adjourn, which by understanding was regarded\r\nas a test of confidence. A few hours later the ministers met and\r\ndecided that, although they had been sustained by a majority of the\r\nHouse, \"it behoved them as the queen's servants to resent the slight\r\nwhich had been offered Her Majesty by the action of the assembly in\r\ncalling in question Her Majesty's choice of the capital.\" The\r\ngovernor-general, Sir Edmund Bond Head, sent for Mr. Brown as the\r\nleader of the Opposition to form a government. It was contended by\r\nLiberals that he ought not to have taken this step unless he intended\r\nto give Mr. Brown and his colleagues his full confidence and support.\r\nIf he believed that the defeat of the government was a mere accident,\r\nand that on general grounds it commanded a working majority in the\r\nlegislature, he ought not to have accepted the resignation, unless he\r\nintended to sanction a fresh appeal to the country.\r\n\r\nThe invitation to form an administration was received by Mr. Brown on\r\nThursday, July 28th. He at once waited on the governor-general and\r\nobtained permission to consult his friends. He called a meeting of the\r\nUpper Canadian members of his party in both Houses, and obtained from\r\nthem promises of cordial support. With Dorion he had an important\r\ninterview. Dorion agreed that the principle of representation by\r\npopulation was sound, but said that the French-Canadian people feared\r\nthe consequences of Upper Canadian preponderance, feared that the\r\npeculiar institutions of French Canada would be swept away. To assure\r\nthem, representation by population must be accompanied by\r\nconstitutional checks and safeguards. Brown and Dorion parted in the\r\nbelief that this could be arranged. They believed also that they\r\ncould agree upon an educational policy in which religious instruction\r\ncould be given without the evils of separation.\r\n\r\nThough Mr. Brown's power did not lie in the manipulation of\r\ncombinations of men, he succeeded on this occasion in enlisting the\r\nservices of colleagues of high character and capacity, including\r\nbesides Dorion, Oliver Mowat, John Sandfield Macdonald, Luther Holton\r\nand L. T. Drummond. On Saturday morning Mr. Brown waited upon the\r\ngovernor-general, and informed him that having consulted his friends\r\nand obtained the aid of Mr. Dorion, he was prepared to undertake the\r\ntask of forming an administration. During the day the formation of the\r\nministry was completed. \"At nine o'clock on Sunday night,\" to give the\r\nstory in Mr. Brown's words, \"learning that Mr. Dorion was ill, I went\r\nto see him at his apartments at the Rossin House, and while with him\r\nthe governor-general's secretary entered and handed me a despatch. No\r\nsooner did I see the outside of the document than I understood it all.\r\nI felt at once that the whole corruptionist camp had been in commotion\r\nat the prospect of the whole of the public departments being subjected\r\nto the investigations of a second public accounts' committee, and\r\ncomprehended at once that the transmission of such a despatch could\r\nhave but the one intention of raising an obstacle in the way of the\r\nnew cabinet taking office, and I was not mistaken.\"[11]\r\n\r\nThe despatch declared that the governor-general gave no pledge,\r\nexpress or implied, with reference to dissolution. When advice was\r\ntendered on the subject he would act as he deemed best. It then laid\r\ndown, with much detail, the terms on which he would consent to\r\nprorogation. Bills for the registration of voters and for the\r\nprohibition of fraudulent assignments and gifts by leaders should be\r\nenacted, and certain supplies obtained.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown criticized both these declarations. It was not necessary for\r\nthe governor-general to say that he gave no pledge in regard to\r\ndissolution. To demand such a pledge would have been utterly\r\nunconstitutional. The governor was quite right in saying that he would\r\ndeal with the proposal when it was made by his advisers. But while he\r\nneedlessly and gratuitously declared that he would not pledge himself\r\nbeforehand as to dissolution, he took exactly the opposite course as\r\nto prorogation, specifying almost minutely the terms on which he would\r\nconsent to that step. Brown contended that the governor had no right\r\nto lay down conditions, or to settle beforehand the measures that must\r\nbe enacted during the session. This was an attempt to dictate, not\r\nonly to the ministry, but to the legislature. Mr. Brown and his\r\ncolleagues believed that the governor was acting in collusion with the\r\nministers who had resigned, that the intriguers were taken by\r\nsurprise when Brown showed himself able to form a ministry, and that\r\nthe Sunday communication was a second thought, a hurriedly devised\r\nplan to bar the way of the new ministers to office.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning before conferring with his colleagues, Brown wrote\r\nto the governor-general, stating that his ministry had been formed,\r\nand submitting that \"until they have assumed the functions of\r\nconstitutional advisers of the Crown, he and his proposed colleagues\r\nwill not be in a position to discuss the important measures and\r\nquestions of public policy referred to in his memorandum.\" Brown then\r\nmet his colleagues, who unanimously approved of his answer to the\r\ngovernor's memorandum, and agreed also that it was intended as a bar\r\nto their acceptance of office. They decided not to ask for a pledge as\r\nto dissolution, nor to make or accept conditions of any kind. \"We were\r\nwilling to risk our being turned out of office within twenty-four\r\nhours, but we were not willing to place ourselves constitutionally in\r\na false position. We distinctly contemplated all that Sir Edmund Head\r\ncould do and that he has done, and we concluded that it was our duty\r\nto accept office, and throw on the governor-general the responsibility\r\nof denying us the support we were entitled to, and which he had\r\nextended so abundantly to our predecessor.\"\r\n\r\nWhen parliament assembled on Monday, a vote of want of confidence was\r\ncarried against the new government in both Houses. The newly\r\nappointed ministers had, of course, resigned their seats in parliament\r\nin order that they might offer themselves for re-election. It is true\r\nthe majority was too great to be accounted for by the absence of the\r\nministers. But the result was affected by the lack, not only of the\r\nvotes of the ministers, but of their voices. In the absence of\r\nministerial explanation, confusion and misunderstanding prevailed. The\r\nfact that Brown had been able to find common ground with Catholic and\r\nFrench-Canadian members had occasioned surprise and anxiety. On the\r\none side it was feared that Brown had surrendered to the\r\nFrench-Canadians, and on the other that the French-Canadians had\r\nsurrendered to Brown.\r\n\r\nThe conference between Brown and Dorion shows that the government was\r\nformed for the same purpose as the Brown-Macdonald coalition of\r\n1864--the settlement of difficulties that prevented the right working\r\nof the union. The official declaration of its policy contains these\r\nwords: \"His Excellency's present advisers have entered the government\r\nwith the fixed determination to propose constitutional measures for\r\nthe establishment of that harmony between Upper and Lower Canada which\r\nis essential to the prosperity of the province.\"\r\n\r\nDissolution was asked on the ground that the new government intended\r\nto propose important constitutional changes, and that the parliament\r\ndid not represent the country, many of its members owing their seals\r\nto gross fraud and corruption. Thirty-two seats were claimed from\r\nsitting members on these grounds. The cases of the Quebec and Russell\r\nelection have already been mentioned. The member elected for\r\nLotbinière was expelled for violent interference with the freedom of\r\nelection. Brown and his colleagues contended that these practices had\r\nprevailed to such an extent that the legislature could not be said to\r\nrepresent the country. Head's reply was that the frauds were likely to\r\nbe repeated if a new election were held; that they really afforded a\r\nreason for postponing the election, at least until more stringent laws\r\nwere enacted. The dissolution was refused; the Brown-Dorion government\r\nresigned, and the old ministers were restored to office.\r\n\r\nOn the resignation of the Brown-Dorion ministry the governor called\r\nupon A. T. Galt, who had given an independent support to the\r\nMacdonald-Cartier government. During the session of 1858 he had placed\r\nbefore the House resolutions favouring the federal union of Canada,\r\nthe Maritime Provinces and the North-West Territory, and it is\r\npossible that his advocacy of this policy had something to do with the\r\noffer of the premiership. As yet, however, he was not prominent\r\nenough, nor could he command a support large enough, to warrant his\r\nacceptance of the office, and he declined. Then followed the \"Double\r\nShuffle.\"\r\n\r\nThe Macdonald-Cartier government resumed office under the name of the\r\nCartier-Macdonald government, with Galt taking the place of Cayley,\r\nand some minor changes. Constitutional usage required that all the\r\nministers should have returned to their constituents for re-election.\r\nA means of evading this requirement was found. The statute governing\r\nthe case provided that when any minister should resign his office and\r\nwithin one month afterwards accept another office in the ministry, he\r\nshould not thereby vacate his seat. With the object of obviating the\r\nnecessity for a new election, Cartier, Macdonald, and their\r\ncolleagues, in order to bring themselves within the letter of the law,\r\nalthough not within its spirit, exchanged offices, each taking a\r\ndifferent one from that which he had resigned eight days before.\r\nShortly before midnight of the sixth of August, they solemnly swore to\r\ndischarge the duties of offices which several of them had no intention\r\nof holding; and a few minutes afterwards the second shuffle took\r\nplace, and Cartier and Macdonald having been inspector-general and\r\npostmaster-general for this brief space, became again attorney-general\r\neast and attorney-general west.\r\n\r\nThe belief of the Reformers that the governor-general was guilty of\r\npartiality and of intrigue with the Conservative ministers is set\r\nforth as part of the history of the time. There is evidence of\r\npartiality, but no evidence of intrigue. The biographer of Sir John\r\nMacdonald denies the charge of intrigue, but says that Macdonald\r\nand the governor were intimate personal friends.[12] Dent, who\r\nalso scouts the charge of intrigue, says that the governor was\r\nprejudiced against Brown, regarding him as a mere obstructionist.[13]\r\nThe governor-general seems to have been influenced by these personal\r\nfeelings, making everything as difficult as possible for Brown, and as\r\neasy as possible for Macdonald, even to the point of acquiescing in\r\nthe evasion of the law known as the \"Double Shuffle.\"\r\n\r\nIn the debate on confederation. Senator Ferrier said that a political\r\nwarfare had been waged in Canada for many years, of a nature\r\ncalculated to destroy all moral and political principles, both in the\r\nlegislature and out of it. The \"Double Shuffle\" is so typical of this\r\ndreary and ignoble warfare and it played so large a part in the\r\npolitical history of the time, that it has been necessary to describe\r\nit at some length. But for these considerations, the episode would\r\nhave deserved scant notice. The headship of one of the ephemeral\r\nministries that preceded confederation could add little to the\r\nreputation of Mr. Brown. His powers were not shown at their best in\r\noffice, and the surroundings of office were not congenial to him. His\r\nstrength lay in addressing the people directly, through his paper or\r\non the platform, and in the hour of defeat or disappointment he turned\r\nto the people for consolation. \"During these contests,\" he said some\r\nyears afterwards, \"it was this which sustained the gallant band of\r\nReformers who so long struggled for popular rights: that, abused as we\r\nmight be, we had this consolation, that we could not go anywhere among\r\nour fellow-countrymen from one end of the country to the other--in\r\nTory constituencies as well as in Reform constituencies--without the\r\ncertainty of receiving from the honest, intelligent yeomanry of the\r\ncountry--from the true, right-hearted, right-thinking people of Upper\r\nCanada, who came out to meet us--the hearty grasp of the hand and the\r\nhearty greeting that amply rewarded the labour we had expended in\r\ntheir behalf. That is the highest reward I have hoped for in public\r\nlife, and I am sure that no man who earns that reward will ever in\r\nUpper Canada have better occasion to speak of the gratitude of the\r\npeople.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] Speech to Toronto electors, August, 1858.\r\n\r\n[12] Pope's _Memoirs of Sir John Macdonald_, Vol. I., pp. 133, 134.\r\n\r\n[13] Dent's _Last Forty Years_, Vol. II., pp. 379, 380.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nAGAINST AMERICAN SLAVERY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his home in Scotland Brown had been imbued with a hatred of\r\nslavery. He spent several years of his early manhood in New York, and\r\nfelt in all its force the domination of the slave-holding element.\r\nThence he moved to Canada, for many years the refuge of the hunted\r\nslave. It is estimated that even before the passage of the Fugitive\r\nSlave Law, there were twenty thousand coloured refugees in Canada. It\r\nwas customary for these poor creatures to hide by day and to travel by\r\nnight. When all other signs failed they kept their eyes fixed on the\r\nNorth Star, whose light \"seemed the enduring witness of the divine\r\ninterest in their deliverance.\" By the system known as the\r\n\"underground railway,\" the fugitive was passed from one friendly house\r\nto another. A code of signals was used by those engaged in the work of\r\nmercy--pass words, peculiar knocks and raps, a call like that of the\r\nowl. Negroes in transit were described as \"fleeces of wool,\" and\r\n\"volumes of the irrepressible conflict bound in black.\"\r\n\r\nThe passage of the Fugitive Slave Law deprived the negro of his\r\nsecurity in the free states, and dragged back into slavery men and\r\nwomen who had for years been living in freedom, and had found means\r\nto earn their bread and to build up little homes. Hence an impetus was\r\ngiven to the movement towards Canada, which the slave-holders tried to\r\ncheck by talking freely of the rigours of the Canadian climate. Lewis\r\nClark, the original of George Harris in _Uncle Tom's Cabin_ was told\r\nthat if he went to Canada the British would put his eyes out, and keep\r\nhim in a mine for life. Another was told that the Detroit River was\r\nthree thousand miles wide.\r\n\r\nBut the exodus to Canada went on, and the hearts of the people were\r\nmoved to compassion by the arrival of ragged and foot-sore wanderers.\r\nThey found a warm friend in Brown, who paid the hotel bill of one for\r\na week, gave fifty dollars to maintain a negro family, and besides\r\nnumerous acts of personal kindness, filled the columns of the _Globe_\r\nwith appeals on behalf of the fugitives. Early in 1851 the\r\nAnti-Slavery Society of Canada was organized. The president was the\r\nRev. Dr. Willis, afterwards principal of Knox Presbyterian College,\r\nand the names of Peter Brown, George Brown, and Oliver Mowat are found\r\non the committee. The object of the society was \"the extinction of\r\nslavery all over the world by means exclusively lawful and peaceable,\r\nmoral and religious, such as the diffusion of useful information and\r\nargument by tracts, newspapers, lectures, and correspondence, and by\r\nmanifesting sympathy with the houseless and homeless victims of\r\nslavery flying to our soil.\" Concerts were given, and the proceeds\r\napplied in aid of the refugees.\r\n\r\nBrown was also strongly interested in the settlements of refugees\r\nestablished throughout Western Canada. Under an act of the Canadian\r\nparliament \"for the settlement and moral improvement of the coloured\r\npopulation of Canada,\" large tracts of land were acquired, divided\r\ninto fifty acre lots, and sold to refugees at low prices, payable in\r\ninstalments. Sunday schools and day schools were established. The\r\nmoving spirit in one of these settlements was the Rev. William King, a\r\nPresbyterian, formerly of Louisiana, who had freed his own slaves and\r\nbrought them to Canada. Traces of these settlements still exist.\r\nEither in this way or otherwise, there were large numbers of coloured\r\npeople living in the valley of the Thames (from Chatham to London), in\r\nSt. Catharines, Hamilton, and Toronto.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the Anti-Slavery Society in 1852, Mr. Brown\r\nmoved a resolution expressing gratitude to those American clergymen\r\nwho had exposed the atrocities of the Fugitive Slave Law. He showed\r\nhow, before its enactment, slaves were continually escaping to the\r\nNorthern States, where they were virtually out of reach of their\r\nmasters. There was a law enabling the latter to recover their\r\nproperty, but its edge was dulled by public opinion in the North,\r\nwhich was rapidly growing antagonistic to allowing the free states to\r\nbecome a hunting-ground for slave-catchers. The South took alarm at\r\nthe growth of this feeling, and procured the passage of a more\r\nstringent law. This law enabled the slave-holder to seize the slave\r\nwherever he found him, without warrant, and it forbade the freeman to\r\nshelter the refugee under penalty of six months' imprisonment, a fine\r\nof one thousand dollars, and liability to a civil suit for damages to\r\nthe same amount. The enforcement of the law was given to federal\r\ninstead of to State officials. After giving several illustrations of\r\nthe working of the law, Mr. Brown proceeded to discuss the duty of\r\nCanada in regard to slavery. It was a question of humanity, of\r\nChristianity, and of liberty, in which all men were interested. Canada\r\ncould not escape the contamination of a system existing so near her\r\nborders. \"We, too, are Americans; on us, as well as on them, lies the\r\nduty of preserving the honour of the continent. On us, as on them,\r\nrests the noble trust of shielding free institutions.\"\r\n\r\nHaving long borne the blame of permitting slavery, the people of the\r\nNorth naturally expected that when the great struggle came they would\r\nreceive the moral support of the civilized world in its effort to\r\ncheck and finally to crush out the evil. They were shocked and\r\ndisappointed when this support was not freely and generously given,\r\nand when sympathy with the South showed itself strongly in Great\r\nBritain. Brown dealt with this question in a speech delivered in\r\nToronto shortly after Lincoln's proclamation of emancipation. He had\r\njust returned from Great Britain, and he said that in his six months'\r\njourney through England and Scotland, he had conversed with persons in\r\nall conditions of life, and he was sorry to say that general sympathy\r\nwas with the South. This did not proceed from any change in the\r\nfeeling towards slavery. Hatred of slavery was as strong as ever,\r\nbut it was not believed that African slavery was the real cause\r\nof the war, or that Mr. Lincoln sincerely desired to bring the\r\ntraffic to an end. This misunderstanding he attributed to persistent\r\nmisrepresentation. There were men who rightly understood the merits of\r\nthe contest, and among these he placed the members of the British\r\nministry. The course of the ministry he described as one of scrupulous\r\nneutrality, and firm resistance to the invitations of other powers to\r\ninterfere in the contest.\r\n\r\nBrown himself never for a moment failed to understand the nature of\r\nthe struggle, and he showed an insight, remarkable at that time, into\r\nthe policy of Lincoln. The anti-slavery men of Canada, he said, had an\r\nimportant duty to discharge. \"We, who have stood here on the borders\r\nof the republic for a quarter of a century, protesting against slavery\r\nas the sum of all human villainies--we, who have closely watched every\r\nturn of the question--we, who have for years acted and sympathized\r\nwith the good men of the republic in their efforts for the freedom of\r\ntheir country--we, who have a practical knowledge of the atrocities\r\nof the 'peculiar institution,' learned from the lips of the panting\r\nrefugee upon our shores--we, who have in our ranks men all known on\r\nthe other side of the Atlantic as life-long abolitionists--we, I say,\r\nare in a position to speak with confidence to the anti-slavery men of\r\nGreat Britain--to tell them that they have not rightly understood this\r\nmatter--to tell them that slavery is the one great cause of the\r\nAmerican rebellion, and that the success of the North is the\r\ndeath-knell of slavery. Strange, after all that has passed, that a\r\ndoubt of this should remain.\"\r\n\r\nIt was true, he said, that Lincoln was not elected as an abolitionist.\r\nLincoln declared, and the Republican party declared, that they stood\r\nby the constitution; that they would, so far as the constitution\r\nallowed, restrict slavery and prevent its extension to new territory.\r\nYet they knew that the constitution gave them all they desired. \"Well\r\ndid they know, and well did the Southerners know, that any\r\nanti-slavery president and congress, by their direct power of\r\nlegislation, by their control of the public patronage, and by the\r\napplication of the public moneys, could not only restrict slavery\r\nwithin its present boundaries, but could secure its ultimate\r\nabolition. The South perfectly comprehended that Mr. Lincoln, if\r\nelected, might keep within the letter of the constitution and yet sap\r\nthe foundation of the whole slave system, and they acted\r\naccordingly.\"\r\n\r\nIn answering the question, \"Why did not the North let the slave states\r\ngo in peace?\" Brown freely admitted the right of revolution. \"The\r\nworld no longer believes in the divine right of either kings or\r\npresidents to govern wrong; but those who seek to change an\r\nestablished government by force of arms assume a fearful\r\nresponsibility--a responsibility which nothing but the clearest and\r\nmost intolerable injustice will acquit them for assuming.\" Here was a\r\nrebellion, not to resist injustice but to perpetuate injustice; not to\r\ndeliver the oppressed from bondage, but to fasten more hopelessly than\r\never the chains of slavery on four millions of human beings. Why not\r\nlet the slave states go? Because it would have been wrong, because it\r\nwould have built up a great slave power that no moral influence could\r\nreach, a power that would have overawed the free Northern States,\r\nadded to its territory, and re-established the slave trade. Had\r\nLincoln permitted the slave states to go, and to form such a power, he\r\nwould have brought enduring contempt upon his name, and the people of\r\nEngland would have been the first to reproach him.\r\n\r\nBrown argued, as he had done in 1852, that Canada could not be\r\nindifferent to the question, whether the dominant power of the North\r\nAmerican continent should be slave or free. Holding that liberty had\r\nbetter securities under the British than under the American system, he\r\nyet believed that the failure of the American experiment would be a\r\ncalamity and a blow to free institutions all over the world. For years\r\nthe United States had been the refuge of the oppressed in every land;\r\nmillions had fled from poverty in Europe to find happiness and\r\nprosperity there. From these had been wafted back to Europe new ideas\r\nof the rights of the people. With the fall of the United States this\r\nimpetus to freedom, world-wide in its influence, would cease. Demands\r\nfor popular rights and free constitutions would be met by the despotic\r\nrulers of Europe with the taunt that in the United States free\r\nconstitutions and popular rights had ended in disruption and anarchy.\r\n\"Let us not forget that there have been, and still are, very different\r\nmonarchies in the world from that of our own beloved queen; and\r\nassuredly there are not so many free governments on earth that we\r\nshould hesitate to devise earnestly the success of that one nearest to\r\nour own, modelled from our own, and founded by men of our own race. I\r\ndo most heartily rejoice, for the cause of liberty, that Mr. Lincoln\r\ndid not patiently acquiesce in the dismemberment of the republic.\"\r\n\r\nThe Civil War in the United States raised the most important question\r\nof foreign policy with which the public men of Canada were called upon\r\nto deal in Brown's career. The dismemberment of the British empire\r\nwould hardly have exercised a more profound influence on the human\r\nrace and on world-wide aspirations for freedom, than the dismemberment\r\nof the United States and the establishment on this continent of a\r\nmighty slave empire. Canada could not be indifferent to the issue. How\r\nlong would the slave-holding power, which coerced the North into\r\nconsenting to the Fugitive Slave Law, have tolerated the existence of\r\na free refuge for slaves across the lakes? Either Canada would have\r\nbeen forced to submit to the humiliation of joining in the hunt for\r\nmen, or the British empire would have been obliged to fight the battle\r\nthat the North fought under the leadership of Lincoln. In the face of\r\nthis danger confronting Canada and the empire and freedom, it was a\r\ntime to forget smaller international animosities. Brown was one of the\r\nfew Canadian statesmen who saw the situation clearly and rose to the\r\noccasion. For twenty years by his public speeches, and still more\r\nthrough the generous devotion of the _Globe_ to the cause, he aided\r\nthe cause of freedom and of the union of the lovers of freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nBROWN AND THE ROMAN CATHOLICS\r\n\r\n\r\nThat the _Globe_ and Mr. Brown, as related in a previous chapter,\r\nbecame associated with Lord John Russell's bill and the \"no popery\"\r\nagitation in England, may be regarded as a mere accident. The\r\nexcitement would have died out here as it died out in England, if\r\nthere had not been in Canada such a mass of inflammable material--so\r\nmany questions in which the relations of Church and State were\r\ninvolved. One of these was State endowment of denominational schools.\r\nDuring Brown's early years in Canada the school system was being\r\nplaced on a broad and popular basis. Salaries of teachers were\r\nwretchedly low. Fees were charged to children, and remitted only as an\r\nact of charity. Mr. Brown advocated a free and unsectarian system.\r\nClaims for denominational schools were put forward not only by the\r\nRoman Catholics but by the Anglicans. He argued that if this were\r\nallowed the public school system would be destroyed by division. The\r\ncountry could barely afford to maintain one good school system. To\r\nmaintain a system for each denomination would require an immense\r\naddition to the number of school-houses and teachers, and would absorb\r\nthe whole revenue of the province. At the same time, the educational\r\nforces would be weakened by the division and thousands of children\r\nwould grow up without education. \"Under the non-sectarian system,\"\r\nsaid Brown, \"the day is at hand when we may hope to abolish the\r\nschool-tax and offer free education to every child in the province.\"\r\n\r\nEventually it was found possible to carry out Mr. Brown's idea of free\r\neducation for every child in the province, and yet to allow Roman\r\nCatholic separate schools to be maintained. To this compromise Mr.\r\nBrown became reconciled, because it did not involve, as he had feared,\r\nthe destruction of the free school system by division. The Roman\r\nCatholics of Upper Canada were allowed to maintain separate\r\ndenominational schools, to have them supported by the taxes of Roman\r\nCatholic ratepayers and by provincial grants. So far as the education\r\nof Protestant children was concerned Mr. Brown's advocacy was\r\nsuccessful. He opposed denominational schools because he feared they\r\nwould weaken or destroy the general system of free education for all.\r\nUnder the agreement which was finally arrived at, this fear was not\r\nrealized. In his speech on confederation he admitted that the\r\nsectarian system, carried to a limited extent and confined chiefly to\r\ncities and towns, had not been a very great practical injury. The real\r\ncause of alarm was that the admission of the sectarian principle was\r\nthere, and that at any moment it might be extended to such a degree as\r\nto split up our school system altogether: \"that the separate system\r\nmight gradually extend itself until the whole country was studded\r\nwith nurseries of sectarianism, most hurtful to the best interests of\r\nthe province and entailing an enormous expense to sustain the hosts of\r\nteachers that so prodigal a system of public instruction must\r\ninevitably entail.\"\r\n\r\nThis, however, was not the only question at issue between Mr. Brown\r\nand the Roman Catholic Church. It happened, as has been said above,\r\nthat on his first entry into parliament, the place of meeting was the\r\ncity of Quebec. The Edinburgh-bred man found himself in a Roman\r\nCatholic city, surrounded by every evidence of the power of the\r\nChurch. As he looked up from the floor of the House to the galleries\r\nhe saw a Catholic audience, its character emphasized by the appearance\r\nof priests clad in the distinctive garments of their orders. It was\r\nhis duty to oppose a great mass of legislation intended to strengthen\r\nthat Church and to add to its privileges. His spirit rose and he grew\r\nmore dour and resolute as he realized the strength of the forces\r\nopposed to him.\r\n\r\nIt would be doing an injustice to the memory of Mr. Brown to gloss\r\nover or minimize a most important feature of his career, or to offer\r\napologies which he himself would have despised. The battle was not\r\nfought with swords of lath, and whoever wants to read of an\r\nold-fashioned \"no popery\" fight, carried on with abounding fire and\r\nvigour, will find plenty of matter in the files of the _Globe_ of the\r\nfifties. His success in the election of 1857, so far as Upper Canada\r\nwas concerned, and especially his accomplishment of the rare feat of\r\ncarrying a Toronto seat for the Reform party, was largely due to an\r\nagitation that aroused all the forces and many of the prejudices of\r\nProtestantism. Yet Brown kept and won many warm friends among Roman\r\nCatholics, both in Upper and in Lower Canada. His manliness attracted\r\nthem. They saw in him, not a narrow-minded and cold-hearted bigot,\r\nseeking to force his opinions on others, but a brave and generous man,\r\nfighting for principles. And in Lower Canada there were many Roman\r\nCatholic laymen whose hearts were with him, and who were themselves\r\nentering upon a momentous struggle to free the electorate from\r\nclerical control. In his fight for the separation of Church and State,\r\nhe came into conflict, not with Roman Catholics alone. In his own\r\nPresbyterian Church, at the time of the disruption, he strongly upheld\r\nthe side which was identified with liberty. For several years after\r\nhis arrival in Canada he was fighting against the special privileges\r\nof the Anglican Church. He often said that he was actuated, not by\r\nprejudice against one Church, but by hatred of clerical privilege, and\r\nlove of religious liberty and equality.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 Mr. Brown, in a letter addressed to prominent Roman Catholics,\r\ngave a straight-forward account of his relations with the Roman\r\nCatholic Church. It is repeated here in a somewhat abbreviated form,\r\nbut as nearly as possible in his own words. In the early days of the\r\npolitical history of Upper Canada, the great mass of Catholics were\r\nstaunch Reformers. They suffered from Downing Street rule, from the\r\ndomination of the \"family compact,\" from the clergy reserves and from\r\nother attempts to arm the Anglican Church with special privileges and\r\npowers; they gave an intelligent and cordial support to liberal and\r\nprogressive measures. They contributed to the victory of Baldwin and\r\nLafontaine. But when that victory was achieved, the Upper Canadian\r\nReformers found that a cause was operating to deprive them of its\r\nfruits,--\"the French-Canadian members of the cabinet and their\r\nsupporters in parliament, blocked the way.\" They not only prevented or\r\ndelayed the measures which the Reformers desired, but they forced\r\nthrough parliament measures which antagonized Reform sentiment.\r\n\"Although much less numerous than the people of Upper Canada, and\r\ncontributing to the common purse hardly a fourth of the annual revenue\r\nof the United Provinces, the Lower Canadians sent an equal number of\r\nrepresentatives with the Upper Canadians to parliament, and, by their\r\nunity of action, obtained complete dominancy in the management of\r\npublic affairs.\" Unjust and injurious taxation, waste and\r\nextravagance, and great increases in the public debt followed. Seeking\r\na remedy, the Upper Canadian Reformers demanded, first, representation\r\nby population, giving Upper Canada its just influence in the\r\nlegislature, and second, the entire separation of Church and State,\r\nplacing all denominations on a like footing and leaving each to\r\nsupport its own religious establishments from the funds of its own\r\npeople. They believed that these measures would remove from the public\r\narena causes of strife and heartburning, and would bring about solid\r\nprosperity and internal peace. The battle was fought vigorously. \"The\r\nmost determined efforts were put forth for the final but just\r\nsettlement of all those vexed questions by which religious sects were\r\narrayed against each other. Clergymen were dragged as combatants into\r\nthe political arena, religion was brought into contempt, and\r\nopportunity presented to our French-Canadian friends to rule us\r\nthrough our own dissensions.\" Clergy reserves, sectarian schools, the\r\nuse of the public funds for sectarian purposes, were assailed. \"On\r\nthese and many similar questions, we were met by the French-Canadian\r\nphalanx in hostile array; our whole policy was denounced in language\r\nof the strongest character, and the men who upheld it were assailed as\r\nthe basest of mankind. We, on our part, were not slow in returning\r\nblow for blow, and feelings were excited among the Catholics from\r\nUpper Canada that estranged the great bulk of them from our ranks.\"\r\nThe agitation was carried on, however, until the grievances of which\r\nthe Reformers complained were removed by the Act of Confederation.\r\nUnder that Act the people of Ontario enjoy representation according\r\nto population; they have entire control over their own local affairs;\r\nand the last remnant of the sectarian warfare--the separate school\r\nquestion--was settled forever by a compromise that was accepted as\r\nfinal by all parties concerned.\r\n\r\nIn this letter Mr. Brown said that he was not seeking to cloak over\r\npast feuds or apologize for past occurrences. He gloried in the\r\njustice and soundness of the principles and measures for which he and\r\nhis party had contended, and he was proud of the results of the\r\nconflict. He asked Catholics to read calmly the page of history he had\r\nunfolded. \"Let them blaze away at George Brown afterwards as\r\nvigorously as they please, but let not their old feuds with him close\r\ntheir eyes to the interests of their country, and their own interests\r\nas a powerful section of the body politic.\"\r\n\r\nThe censure applied to those who wantonly draw sectarian questions\r\ninto politics, and set Catholic against Protestant, is just. But it\r\ndoes not attach to those who attack the privileges of any Church, and\r\nwho, when the Church steps into the political arena, strike at it with\r\npolitical weapons. This was Brown's position. He was the sworn foe of\r\nclericalism. He had no affinity with the demagogues and professional\r\nagitators who make a business of attacking the Roman Catholic Church,\r\nnor with those whose souls are filled with vague alarms of papal\r\nsupremacy, and who believe stories of Catholics drilling in churches\r\nto fight their Protestant neighbours. He fought against real tyranny,\r\nfor the removal of real grievances. When he believed that he had found\r\nin confederation the real remedy, he was satisfied, and he did not\r\nkeep up an agitation merely for agitation's sake. It is not necessary\r\nto attempt to justify every word that may have been struck off in the\r\nheat of a great conflict. There was a battle to be fought; he fought\r\nwith all the energy of his nature, and with the weapons that lay at\r\nhand. He would have shared Hotspur's contempt for the fop who vowed\r\nthat \"but for these vile guns he would himself have been a soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nMOVING TOWARDS CONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\nTo whom is due the confederation of the British North American\r\nprovinces is a long vexed question. The Hon. D'Arcy McGee, in his\r\nspeech on confederation, gave credit to Mr. Uniacke, a leading\r\npolitician of Nova Scotia, who in 1800 submitted a scheme of colonial\r\nunion to the imperial authorities; to Chief-Justice Sewell, to Sir\r\nJohn Beverley Robinson, to Lord Durham, to Mr. P. S. Hamilton, a Nova\r\nScotia writer, and to Mr. Alexander Morris, then member for South\r\nLanark, who had advocated the project in a pamphlet entitled _Nova\r\nBritannia_. \"But,\" he added, \"whatever the private writer in his\r\ncloset may have conceived, whatever even the individual statesman may\r\nhave designed, so long as the public mind was uninterested in the\r\nadoption, even in the discussion of a change in our position so\r\nmomentous as this, the union of these separate provinces, the\r\nindividual laboured in vain--perhaps, not wholly in vain, for although\r\nhis work may not have borne fruit then, it was kindling a fire that\r\nwould ultimately light up the whole political horizon and herald the\r\ndawn of a better day for our country and our people. Events stronger\r\nthan advocacy, events stronger than men, have come in at last like\r\nthe fire behind the invisible writing, to bring out the truth of these\r\nwritings and to impress them upon the mind of every thoughtful man who\r\nhas considered the position and probable future of these scattered\r\nprovinces.\" Following Mr. McGee's suggestion, let us try to deal with\r\nthe question from the time that it ceased to be speculative and became\r\npractical, and especially to trace its development in the mind of one\r\nman.\r\n\r\nIn the later fifties Mr. Brown was pursuing a course which led almost\r\nwith certainty to the goal of confederation. The people of Upper\r\nCanada were steadily coming over to his belief that they were\r\nsuffering injustice under the union; that they paid more than their\r\nshare of the taxes, and yet that Lower Canadian influence was dominant\r\nin legislation and in the formation of ministries. Brown's tremendous\r\nagitation convinced them that the situation was intolerable. But it\r\nwas long before the true remedy was perceived. The French-Canadians\r\nwould not agree to Brown's remedy of representation by population.\r\nBrown opposed as reactionary the proposal that the union should be\r\ndissolved. He desired not to go back to the day of small things--on\r\nthe contrary, even at this early day, he was advocating the union of\r\nthe western territories with Canada. Nor was he at first in favour of\r\nthe federal principle. In 1853, in a formal statement of its\r\nprogramme, the _Globe_ advocated uniform legislation for the two\r\nprovinces, and a Reform convention held at Toronto in 1857 recommended\r\nthe same measure, together with representation by population and the\r\naddition of the North-West Territories to Canada.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1858, Brown wrote to his friend, Luther Holton, in a\r\nmanner which showed an open mind: \"No honest man can desire that we\r\nshould remain as we are, and what other way out of our difficulties\r\ncan be suggested but a general legislative union, with representation\r\nby population, a federal union, or a dissolution of the present union.\r\nI am sure that a dissolution cry would be as ruinous to any party as\r\n(in my opinion) it would be wrong. A federal union, it appears to me,\r\ncannot be entertained for Canada alone, but when agitated must include\r\nall British America. We will be past caring for politics when that\r\nmeasure is finally achieved. What powers should be given to the\r\nprovincial legislatures, and what to the federal? Would you abolish\r\ncounty councils? And yet, if you did not, what would the local\r\nparliaments have to control? Would Montreal like to be put under the\r\ngenerous rule of the Quebec politicians? Our friends here are prepared\r\nto consider dispassionately any scheme that may issue from your party\r\nin Lower Canada. They all feel keenly that something must be done.\r\nTheir plan is representation by population, and a fair trial for the\r\npresent union in its integrity; failing this, they are prepared to go\r\nfor dissolution, I believe, but if you can suggest a federal or any\r\nother scheme that could be worked, it will have our most anxious\r\nexamination. Can you sketch a plan of federation such as our friends\r\nbelow would agree to and could carry?\"\r\n\r\nProbably Dorion and other Lower Canadians had a part in converting\r\nBrown to federation. In 1856 Dorion had moved a resolution favouring\r\nthe confederation of the two Canadas. In August, 1858, Brown and\r\nDorion undertook to form a government pledged to the settlement of the\r\nquestion that had arisen between Upper and Lower Canada. Dorion says\r\nit was agreed by the Brown-Dorion government \"that the constitutional\r\nquestion should be taken up and settled, either by a confederation of\r\nthe two provinces, or by representation according to population, with\r\nsuch checks and guarantees as would secure the religious faith, the\r\nlaws, the language, and the peculiar institutions of each section of\r\nthe country from encroachments on the part of the other.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same time an effort in the same direction was made by the\r\nConservative party. A. T. Galt, in the session of 1858, advocated the\r\nfederal union of all the British North American provinces. He declared\r\nthat unless a union were effected, the provinces would inevitably\r\ndrift into the United States. He proposed that questions relating to\r\neducation and likely to arouse religious dissension, ought to be left\r\nto the provinces. The resolutions moved by Mr. Galt in 1858 give him\r\na high place among the promoters of confederation. Galt was asked by\r\nSir Edmund Head to form an administration on the resignation of the\r\nBrown government. Galt refused, but when he subsequently entered the\r\nCartier government it was on condition that the promotion of federal\r\nunion should be embodied in the policy of the government. Cartier,\r\nRoss and Galt visited England in fulfilment of this promise, and\r\ndescribed the serious difficulties that had arisen in Canada. The\r\nmovement failed because the co-operation of the Maritime Provinces\r\ncould not be obtained.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1859 two important steps leading towards federation\r\nwere taken. In October the Lower Canadian members of the Opposition\r\nmet in Montreal and declared for a federal union of the Canadas. They\r\nwent so far as to specify the subjects of federal and local\r\njurisdiction, allowing to the central authority the customs tariff,\r\nthe post-office, patents and copyrights, and the currency; and to the\r\nlocal legislatures education, the laws of property, the administration\r\nof justice, and the control of the militia. In September a meeting of\r\nthe Liberal members of both Houses was held at Toronto, and a circular\r\ncalling a convention of Upper Canadian Reformers was issued. It\r\ndeclared that \"the financial and political evils of the provinces have\r\nreached such a point as to demand a thorough reconsideration of the\r\nrelations between Upper and Lower Canada, and the adoption of\r\nconstitutional changes framed to remedy the great abuses that have\r\narisen under the present system\"; that the nature of the changes had\r\nbeen discussed, but that it was felt that before coming to a\r\nconclusion \"the whole Liberal party throughout Upper Canada should be\r\nconsulted.\" The discussion would be free and unfettered. \"Supporters\r\nof the Opposition advocating a written constitution or a dissolution\r\nof the union--or a federal union of all the British North American\r\nprovinces--or a federal system for Canada alone--or any other plan\r\ncalculated, in their opinion, to meet the existing evils--are all\r\nequally welcome to the convention. The one sole object is to discuss\r\nthe whole subject with candour and without prejudice, that the best\r\nremedy may be found.\" Then came an account of the grievances for which\r\na remedy was sought: \"The position of Upper Canada at this moment is\r\ntruly anomalous and alarming. With a population much more numerous\r\nthan that of Lower Canada, and contributing to the general revenue a\r\nmuch larger share of taxation than the sister province, Upper Canada\r\nfinds herself without power in the administration of the affairs of\r\nthe union. With a constitution professedly based on the principle that\r\nthe will of the majority should prevail, a minority of the people of\r\nUpper Canada, by combination with the Lower Canada majority, are\r\nenabled to rule the upper province in direct hostility to the popular\r\nwill. Extravagant expenditures and hurtful legislative measures are\r\nforced on us in defiance of the protests of large majorities of the\r\nrepresentatives of the people; the most needful reforms are denied,\r\nand offices of honour and emolument are conferred on persons destitute\r\nof popular sympathy, and without qualification beyond that of\r\nunhesitating subserviency to the men who misgovern the country.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention of nearly six hundred delegates gave evidence of a\r\ngenuine, popular movement for constitutional changes. Though it was\r\ncomposed of members of only one party, its discussions were of general\r\ninterest, and were upon a high level of intelligence and public\r\nspirit. The convention was divided between dissolution and federal\r\nunion. Federation first got the ear of the meeting. Free access to the\r\nsea by the St. Lawrence, free trade between Upper and Lower Canada,\r\nwere urged as reasons for continuing the union. Oliver Mowat made a\r\nclosely reasoned speech on the same side. Representation by population\r\nalone would not be accepted by Lower Canada. Dissolution was\r\nimpracticable and could not, at best, be obtained without long\r\nagitation. Federation would give all the advantages of dissolution\r\nwithout its difficulties.\r\n\r\nMowat's speech was received with much favour, and the current had set\r\nstrongly for federation when George Sheppard arose as the chief\r\nadvocate of dissolution. Sheppard had been an editorial writer on the\r\n_Colonist_, had been attracted by Brown and his policy and had joined\r\nthe staff of the _Globe_. His main argument was that the central\r\ngovernment under federation would be a costly and elaborate affair,\r\nand would ultimately overshadow the governments of the provinces.\r\nThere would be a central parliament, a viceroy with all the expense of\r\na court. \"A federal government without federal dignity would be all\r\nmoonshine.\" There was an inherent tendency in central bodies to\r\nacquire increased power. In the United States a federal party had\r\nadvocated a strong central government, and excuses were always being\r\nsought to add to its glory and influence. On the other side was a\r\ndemocratic party, championing State rights. \"In Canada, too, we may\r\nexpect to see federation followed by the rise of two parties, one\r\nfighting for a strong central government, the other, like Mr. Brown,\r\ncontending for State rights, local control, and the limited authority\r\nof the central power.\" One of the arguments for federation was that it\r\nprovided for bringing in the North-West Territory. That implied an\r\nexpensive federal government for the purpose of organizing the new\r\nterritory, building its roads, etc. \"Is this federation,\" he asked,\r\n\"proposed as a step towards nationality? If so, I am with you.\r\nFederation implies nationality. For colonial purposes only it would be\r\na needless incumbrance.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, with its accurate forecast of the growth of the central\r\npower, produced such an impression that the federalists amended their\r\nresolution, and proposed, instead of a general government, \"some\r\njoint authority\" for federal purposes. This concession was made by\r\nWilliam Macdougall, one of the secretaries and chief figures of the\r\nconvention, who said that he had been much impressed by Sheppard's\r\neloquence and logic. The creation of a powerful, elaborate and\r\nexpensive central government such as now exists did not form part of\r\nthe plans of the Liberals either in Upper or Lower Canada at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nBrown, who spoke towards the close of the convention, declared that he\r\nhad no morbid fear of dissolution of the union, but preferred the plan\r\nof federation, as giving Upper Canada the advantage of free trade with\r\nLower Canada and the free navigation of the St. Lawrence. One of his\r\nmost forcible passages was an answer to Sheppard's question whether\r\nthe federation was a step towards nationality. \"I do place the\r\nquestion on grounds of nationality. I do hope there is not one\r\nCanadian in this assembly who does not look forward with high hope to\r\nthe day when these northern countries shall stand out among the\r\nnations of the world as one great confederation. What true Canadian\r\ncan witness the tide of emigration now commencing to flow into the\r\nvast territories of the North-West without longing to have a share in\r\nthe first settlement of that great, fertile country? Who does not feel\r\nthat to us rightfully belong the right and the duty of carrying the\r\nblessings of civilization throughout those boundless regions, and\r\nmaking our own country the highway of traffic to the Pacific? But is\r\nit necessary that all this should be accomplished at once? Is it not\r\ntrue wisdom to commence federation with our own country, and leave it\r\nopen to extension hereafter if time and experience shall prove it\r\ndesirable? And shall we not then have better control over the terms of\r\nfederation than if all were made parties to the original compact, and\r\nhow can there be the slightest question with one who longs for such a\r\nnationality between dissolution and the scheme of the day? Is it not\r\nclear that the former would be the death blow to the hope of future\r\nunion, while the latter will readily furnish the machinery for a great\r\nfederation?\"\r\n\r\nThe resolutions adopted by the convention declared that the\r\nlegislative union, because of antagonisms developed through\r\ndifferences of origin, local interests, and other causes, could no\r\nlonger be maintained; that the plan known as the \"double majority\" did\r\nnot afford a permanent remedy; that a federal union of all the British\r\nNorth American colonies was out of the range of remedies for present\r\nevils; that the principle of representation by population must be\r\nrecognized in any new union, and that \"the best practical remedy for\r\nthe evils now encountered in the government of Canada is to be found\r\nin the formation of two or more local governments, to which shall be\r\ncommitted the control of all matters of a local or sectional\r\ncharacter, and some joint authority charged with such matters as are\r\nnecessarily common to both sections of the province.\"\r\n\r\nThe hopes that had been aroused by this convention were disappointed,\r\nor rather deferred. When Brown, in the following session of the\r\nlegislature, brought forward resolutions in the sense of those adopted\r\nby the convention, he found coldness and dissension in his own party,\r\nand the resolutions were defeated by a large majority. Subsequently\r\nMr. Brown had a long illness, retired from the leadership, and spent\r\nsome time in England and Scotland. In his absence the movement for\r\nconstitutional change was stayed. But \"events stronger than advocacy,\"\r\nin Mr. McGee's words, were operating. Power oscillated between the\r\nConservative and Reform parties, and two general elections, held\r\nwithin as many years, failed to solve the difficulty. When federation\r\nwas next proposed, it had become a political necessity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nLAST YEARS OF THE UNION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1860, Mr. Brown contemplated retiring from the leadership of the\r\nparty. In a letter to Mr. Mowat, he said that the enemies of reform\r\nwere playing the game of exciting personal hostility against himself,\r\nand reviving feelings inspired by the fierce contests of the past. It\r\nmight be well to appoint a leader who would arouse less personal\r\nhostility. A few months later he had a long and severe illness, which\r\nprevented him from taking his place in the legislature during the\r\nsession of 1861 and from displaying his usual activity in the general\r\nelection of the summer of that year. He did, however, accept the hard\r\ntask of contesting East Toronto, where he was defeated by Mr. John\r\nCrawford by a majority of one hundred and ninety-one. Mr. Brown then\r\nannounced that the defeat had opened up the way for his retirement\r\nwithout dishonour, and that he would not seek re-election. Some public\r\nadvantages, he said, might flow from that decision. Those whose\r\ninterest it was that misgovernment should continue, would no longer be\r\nable to make a scapegoat of George Brown. Admitting that he had used\r\nstrong language in denouncing French domination, he justified his\r\ncourse as the only remedy for the evil. In 1852 he could hardly find\r\na seconder for his motion in favour of representation by population;\r\nin the election just closed, he claimed fifty-three members from Upper\r\nCanada, elected to stand or fall by that measure. He had fought a ten\r\nyears' battle without faltering. He advocated opposition to any\r\nministry of either party that would refuse to settle the question.\r\n\r\nThe Conservative government was defeated, in the session following the\r\nelection, on a militia bill providing for the maintenance of a force\r\nof fifty thousand men at a cost of about one million dollars. The\r\nAmerican Civil War was in progress; the _Trent_ affair had assumed a\r\nthreatening appearance and it was deemed necessary to place the\r\nprovince in a state of defence. The bill was defeated by the defection\r\nof some French-Canadian supporters of the government. The event caused\r\nmuch disappointment in England; and from this time forth, continual\r\npressure from that quarter in regard to defence was one of the forces\r\ntending towards confederation.\r\n\r\nJohn Sandfield Macdonald, who was somewhat unexpectedly called upon to\r\nform a ministry, was an enthusiastic advocate of the \"double\r\nmajority,\" by which he believed the union could be virtually\r\nfederalized without formal constitutional change. Upper Canadian\r\nministers were to transact Upper Canadian business, and so with Lower\r\nCanada, the administration, as a whole, managing affairs of common\r\ninterest. Local legislation was not to be forced on either province\r\nagainst the wish of the representatives. The administration for each\r\nsection should possess the confidence of a majority of representatives\r\nfrom that section.\r\n\r\nBrown strongly opposed the \"double majority\" plan, which he regarded\r\nas a mere makeshift for reform in the representation, and he was in\r\nsome doubt whether he should support or oppose the Liberal ministers\r\nwho offered for re-election. He finally decided, after consultation\r\nwith his brother Gordon, \"to permit them to go in unopposed, and hold\r\nthem up to the mark under the stimulus of bit and spur.\"\r\n\r\nIn July 1862, Mr. Brown sailed for Great Britain, and in September he\r\nwrote Mr. Holton that he had had a most satisfactory interview with\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle at the latter's request. They seem to have\r\ntalked freely about Canadian politics. \"His scruples about\r\nrepresentation are entirely gone. It would have done even Sandfield\r\n[Macdonald] good to hear his ideas on the absurdity of the 'double\r\nmajority.' Whatever small politicians and the London _Times_ may say,\r\nyou may depend upon this, that the government and the leaders of the\r\nOpposition perfectly understand our position, and have no thought of\r\nchanging the relations between Canada and the mother country. On the\r\ncontrary, the members of the government, with the exception of\r\nGladstone, are set upon the Intercolonial Railway and a grand transit\r\nroute across the continent.\" He remarked upon the bitterness of the\r\nBritish feeling against the United States, and said that he was\r\nperplexed by the course of the London _Times_ in pandering to the\r\npassions of the people.\r\n\r\nThe most important event of his visit to Scotland was yet to come. On\r\nNovember 27th he married Miss Anne Nelson, daughter of the well-known\r\npublisher, Thomas Nelson--a marriage which was the beginning of a most\r\nhappy domestic life of eighteen years. This lady survived him until\r\nMay, 1906. On his return to Canada with his bride, Mr. Brown was met\r\nat Toronto station by several thousand friends. In reply to a\r\ncomplimentary address, he said, \"I have come back with strength\r\ninvigorated, with new, and I trust, enlarged views, and with the most\r\nearnest desire to aid in advancing the prosperity and happiness of\r\nCanada.\"\r\n\r\nIt has been seen that the Macdonald-Sicotte government had shelved the\r\nquestion of representation by population and had committed itself to\r\nthe device of the \"double majority.\" During Mr. Brown's absence\r\nanother movement, which he had strongly resisted, had been gaining\r\nground. In 1860, 1861, and 1862, Mr. R. W. Scott, of Ottawa, had\r\nintroduced legislation intended to strengthen the Roman Catholic\r\nseparate school system of Upper Canada. In 1863, he succeeded, by\r\naccepting certain modifications, in obtaining the support of Dr.\r\nRyerson, superintendent of education. Another important advantage was\r\nthat his bill was adopted as a government measure by the Sandfield\r\nMacdonald ministry. The bill became law in spite of the fact that it\r\nwas opposed by a majority of the representatives from Upper Canada.\r\nThis was in direct contravention of the \"double majority\" resolutions\r\nadopted by the legislature at the instance of the government. The\r\npremier had declared that there should be a truce to the agitation for\r\nrepresentation by population or for other constitutional changes. That\r\nagitation had been based upon the complaint that legislation was being\r\nforced upon Upper Canada by Lower Canadian votes. The \"double\r\nmajority\" resolutions had been proposed as a substitute for\r\nconstitutional change. In the case of the Separate School Bill they\r\nwere disregarded, and the premier was severely criticized for allowing\r\nhis favourite principle to be contravened.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown had been absent in the sessions of 1861 and 1862, and he did\r\nnot enter the House in 1863 until the Separate School Bill had passed\r\nits second reading. In the _Globe_, however, it was assailed\r\nvigorously, one ground being that the bill was not a finality, but\r\nthat the Roman Catholic Church would continually make new demands and\r\nencroachments, until the public school system was destroyed. On this\r\nquestion of finality there was much controversy. Dr. Ryerson always\r\ninsisted that there was an express agreement that it was to be final;\r\non the Roman Catholic side this is denied. At confederation Brown\r\naccepted the Act of 1863 as a final settlement. He said that if he had\r\nbeen present in 1863, he would have voted against the bill, because\r\nit extended the facility for establishing separate schools. \"It had,\r\nhowever, this good feature, that it was accepted by the Roman Catholic\r\nauthorities, and carried through parliament as a final compromise of\r\nthe question in Upper Canada.\" He added: \"I have not the slightest\r\nhesitation in accepting it as a necessary condition of the union.\"\r\nWith confederation, therefore, we may regard Brown's opposition to\r\nseparate schools in Upper Canada as ended. In accepting the terms of\r\nconfederation, he accepted the Separate School Act of 1863, though\r\nwith the condition that it should be final, a condition repudiated on\r\nthe Roman Catholic side.\r\n\r\nThe Sandfield Macdonald government was weakened by this incident, and\r\nit soon afterwards fell upon a general vote of want of confidence\r\nmoved by Mr. John A. Macdonald. Parliament was dissolved and an\r\nelection was held in the summer of 1863. The Macdonald-Dorion\r\ngovernment obtained a majority in Upper but not in Lower Canada, and\r\non the whole, its tenure of power was precarious in the extreme.\r\nFinally, in March, 1864, it resigned without waiting for a vote of\r\nwant of confidence. Its successor, the Taché-Macdonald government, had\r\na life of only three months, and its death marks the birth of a new\r\nera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATION\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Events stronger than advocacy, events stronger than men,\" to repeat\r\nD'Arcy McGee's phrase, combined in 1864 to remove confederation from\r\nthe field of speculation to the field of action. For several years the\r\nBritish government had been urging upon Canada the necessity for\r\nundertaking a greater share of her own defence. This view was\r\nexpressed with disagreeable candour in the London _Times_ and\r\nelsewhere on the occasion of the defeat of the Militia Bill of 1862.\r\nThe American Civil War emphasized the necessity for measures of\r\ndefence. At the time of the _Trent_ seizure, Great Britain and the\r\nUnited States were on the verge of war, of which Canada would have\r\nbeen the battleground. As the war progressed, the world was astonished\r\nby the development of the military power of the republic. It seemed\r\nnot improbable, at that time, that when the success of the North was\r\nassured, its great armies would be used for the subjugation of Canada.\r\nThe North had come to regard Canada as a home of Southern sympathizers\r\nand a place in which conspiracies against the republic were hatched by\r\nSoutherners. Though Canada was not to blame for the use that was made\r\nof its soil, yet some ill-feeling was aroused, and public men were\r\nwarranted in regarding the peril as real.\r\n\r\nCanada was also about to lose a large part of its trade. For ten years\r\nthat trade had been built up largely on the basis of reciprocity with\r\nthe United States, and the war had largely increased the American\r\ndemand for Canadian products. It was generally expected, and that\r\nexpectation was fulfilled, that the treaty would be abrogated by the\r\nUnited States. It was feared that the policy of commercial\r\nnon-intercourse would be carried even farther, the bonding system\r\nabolished, and Canada cut off from access to the seaboard during the\r\nwinter.[14]\r\n\r\nIf we add to these difficulties the domestic dissensions of Canada, we\r\nmust recognize that the outlook was dark. Canada was then a fringe of\r\nsettlement, extending from the Detroit River to the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence, having no independent access to the Atlantic except during\r\nthe summer. She had been depending largely upon Great Britain for\r\ndefence, and upon the United States for trade. She had received\r\nwarning that both these supports were to be weakened, and that she\r\nmust rely more on her own resources, find new channels of trade and\r\nnew means of defence. The country lay in the midst of the continent,\r\nisolated from the west, isolated in part from the east, with a\r\npowerful and not too friendly neighbour to the south. Upper and Lower\r\nCanada, with their racial differences as sharply defined as in the\r\ndays of Lord Durham, regarded each other with distrust; one political\r\ncombination after another had failed to obtain a working majority of\r\nthe legislature, and domestic government was paralyzed. Such a\r\ncombination of danger and difficulty, within and without, might well\r\narouse alarm, rebuke faction and stimulate patriotism.\r\n\r\nThe election of 1863 was virtually a drawn battle. The Reformers had a\r\nlarge majority in Upper Canada, their opponents a like majority in\r\nLower Canada, and thus not only the two parties, but the two\r\nprovinces, were arrayed against each other. The Reform government,\r\nheaded by Sandfield Macdonald and Dorion, found its position of\r\nweakness and humiliation intolerable, and resigned in March, 1864. The\r\ntroubled governor-general called upon A. T. Fergusson Blair, a\r\ncolleague of Sandfield Macdonald, to form a new administration. He\r\nfailed. He called upon Cartier with a like result. He finally had a\r\nlittle better success with Sir E. P. Taché, a veteran who had been a\r\ncolleague of Baldwin, of Hincks, and of Macdonald. Taché virtually\r\nrestored the Cartier-Macdonald government, taking in Foley and McGee\r\nfrom the other side. In less than three months, on June 14th, this\r\ngovernment was defeated, and on the very day of its defeat relief\r\ncame. Letters written by Brown to his family during the month\r\npreceding the crisis throw some light on the situation.\r\n\r\nOn May 13th he writes: \"Things here are very unsatisfactory; no one\r\nsees his way out of the mess--and there is no way but my\r\nway--representation by population. There is great talk to-day of\r\ncoalition--and what do you think? Why, that in order to make the\r\ncoalition successful, the imperial government are to offer me the\r\ngovernment of one of the British colonies. I have been gravely asked\r\nto-day by several if it is true, and whether I would accept. My reply\r\nwas, I would rather be proprietor of the _Globe_ newspaper for a few\r\nyears than be governor-general of Canada, much less a trumpery little\r\nprovince. But I need hardly tell you, the thing has no foundation,\r\nbeyond sounding what could be done to put me out of the way and let\r\nmischief go on. But we won't be bought at any price, shall we?\" On May\r\n18th he writes that he has brought on his motion for constitutional\r\nchanges, and on May 20th that it has carried and taken Cartier and\r\nMacdonald by surprise. \"Much that is directly practical may not flow\r\nfrom the committee, but it is an enormous gain to have the\r\nacknowledgment on our journals that a great evil exists, and that some\r\nremedy must be found.\"\r\n\r\nOn June 14th Mr. Brown, as chairman of a committee appointed to\r\nconsider the difficulties connected with the government of Canada,\r\nbrought in a report recommending \"a federative system, applied either\r\nto Canada alone, or to the whole British North American provinces.\"\r\nThis was the day on which the Taché government was defeated. On the\r\nsubject of the negotiations which followed between Mr. Brown and the\r\ngovernment, there is a difference between the account given by Sir\r\nJohn Macdonald in the House, and accepted by all parties as official,\r\nand a letter written by Mr. Brown to a member of his family. The\r\nofficial account represents the first movement as coming from Mr.\r\nBrown, the letter says that the suggestion came from the\r\ngovernor-general. It would seem likely that the idea moved gradually\r\nfrom informal conversations to formal propositions. The governor had\r\nproposed a coalition on the defeat of the Macdonald-Dorion government,\r\nand he repeated the suggestion on the defeat of the Taché-Macdonald\r\ngovernment; but his official memorandum contains no reference to\r\nconstitutional changes. It would seem that there was a great deal of\r\ntalk of coalition in the air before Brown made his proposals, and\r\nperhaps some talk of offering him an appointment that would remove him\r\nfrom public life. But the Conservative ministers were apparently\r\nthinking merely of a coalition that would break the dead-lock, and\r\nenable the ordinary business of the country to proceed. Brown's idea\r\nwas to find a permanent remedy in the form of a change in the\r\nconstitution. When he made his proposal to co-operate with his\r\nopponents for the purpose of settling the difficulties between Upper\r\nand Lower Canada, his proposal fell upon minds familiarized with the\r\nidea of coalition, and hence its ready acceptance. On his part, Mr.\r\nBrown was ready to abate certain party advantages in order to bring\r\nabout constitutional reform. Mr. Ferrier, in the debate on\r\nconfederation, says that it was he who suggested that the proposal\r\nmade by Mr. Brown to Mr. Pope and Mr. Morris should be communicated to\r\nthe government. Ferrier gives a lively account of the current gossip\r\nas to the meeting between Brown and the ministers. \"I think I can\r\nremember this being said, that when Mr. Galt met Mr. Brown he received\r\nhim with that manly, open frankness which characterizes him; that when\r\nMr. Cartier met Mr. Brown, he looked carefully to see that his two\r\nRouge friends were not behind him, and that when he was satisfied they\r\nwere not, he embraced him with open arms and swore eternal friendship;\r\nand that Mr. Macdonald, at a very quick glance, saw there was an\r\nopportunity of forming a great and powerful dependency of the British\r\nempire.... We all thought, in fact, that a political millennium had\r\narrived.\"\r\n\r\nIn a family letter written at this time Mr. Brown said: \"June 18th,\r\npast one in the morning. We have had great times since I wrote you. On\r\nTuesday we defeated the government by a majority of two. They asked\r\nthe governor-general to dissolve parliament, and he consented; but\r\nbefore acting on it, at the governor's suggestion, they applied to me\r\nto aid them in reconstructing the government, on the basis of settling\r\nthe constitutional difficulties between Upper and Lower Canada. I\r\nrefused to accept office, but agreed to help them earnestly and\r\nsincerely in the matter they proposed. Negotiations were thereupon\r\ncommenced, and are still going on, with considerable hope of finding a\r\nsatisfactory solution to our trouble. The facts were announced in the\r\nHouse to-day by John A. Macdonald, amid tremendous cheering from both\r\nsides of the House. You never saw such a scene; but you will have it\r\nall in the papers, so I need not repeat. Both sides are extremely\r\nurgent that I should accept a place in the government, if it were only\r\nfor a week; but I will not do this unless it is absolutely needed to\r\nthe success of the negotiations. A more agreeable proposal is that I\r\nshould go to England to arrange the new constitution with the imperial\r\ngovernment. But as the whole thing may fail, we will not count our\r\nchickens just yet.\"\r\n\r\nSir Richard Cartwright, then a young member of parliament, relates an\r\nincident illustrating the tension on men's minds at that time. He\r\nsays: \"On that memorable afternoon when Mr. Brown, not without\r\nemotion, made his statement to a hushed and expectant House, and\r\ndeclared that he was about to ally himself with Sir Georges Cartier\r\nand his friends for the purpose of carrying out confederation, I saw\r\nan excitable, elderly little French member rush across the floor,\r\nclimb up on Mr. Brown, who, as you remember, was of a stature\r\napproaching the gigantic, fling his arms about his neck and hang\r\nseveral seconds there suspended, to the visible consternation of Mr.\r\nBrown and to the infinite joy of all beholders, pit, box and gallery\r\nincluded.\"[15]\r\n\r\nThe official account given by Mr. Macdonald in the House, is that\r\nimmediately after the defeat of the government on Tuesday night (the\r\n14th), and on the following morning, Mr. Brown spoke to several\r\nsupporters of the administration, strongly urging that the present\r\ncrisis should be utilized in settling forever the constitutional\r\ndifficulties between Upper and Lower Canada, and assuring them that he\r\nwas ready to co-operate with the existing or any other administration\r\nthat would deal with the question promptly and firmly, with a view to\r\nits final settlement. Mr. Morris and Mr. Pope, to whom the suggestion\r\nwas made, obtained leave to communicate it to Mr. John A. Macdonald\r\nand Mr. Galt. On June 17th Mr. Macdonald and Mr. Galt called upon Mr.\r\nBrown. In the conversation that ensued Mr. Brown expressed his extreme\r\nreluctance to entering the ministry, declaring that the public mind\r\nwould be shocked by such an arrangement. The personal question being\r\ndropped for the time, Mr. Brown asked what remedy was proposed. Mr.\r\nMacdonald and Mr. Galt replied that their remedy was a federal union\r\nof all the British North American provinces. Mr. Brown said that this\r\nwould not be acceptable to Upper Canada. The federation of all the\r\nprovinces ought to come and would come in time, but it had not yet\r\nbeen thoroughly considered by the people; and even were this\r\notherwise, there were so many parties to be consulted that its\r\nadoption was uncertain and remote. He expressed his preference for\r\nparliamentary reform, based on population. On further discussion it\r\nappeared that a compromise might be found in an alternative plan, a\r\nfederal union of all the British North American provinces or a federal\r\nunion of Upper and Lower Canada, with provision for the admission of\r\nthe Maritime Provinces and the North-West Territory when they desired.\r\nThere was apparently a difference of opinion as to which alternative\r\nshould be presented first. One memorandum reduced to writing gave the\r\npreference to the larger federation; the second and final memorandum\r\ncontained this agreement: \"The government are prepared to pledge\r\nthemselves to bring in a measure next session for the purpose of\r\nremoving existing difficulties by introducing the federal principle\r\ninto Canada, coupled with such provisions as will permit the Maritime\r\nProvinces and the North-West Territory to be incorporated into the\r\nsame system of government. And the government will, by sending\r\nrepresentatives to the Lower Provinces and to England, use its best\r\nendeavours to secure the assent of those interests which are beyond\r\nthe control of our own legislation to such a measure as may enable all\r\nBritish North America to be united under a general legislature based\r\nupon the federal principle.\"\r\n\r\nIt was Mr. Brown who insisted on this mode of presentation. At the\r\nconvention of 1859 he had expressed in the strongest language his hope\r\nfor the creation of a great Canadian nationality; and he had for years\r\nadvocated the inclusion of the North-West Territories in a greater\r\nCanada. But he regarded the settlement of the difficulties of Upper\r\nand Lower Canada as the most pressing question of the hour, and he did\r\nnot desire that the solution of this question should be delayed or\r\nimperilled. Galt's plan of federation, comprehensive and admirable as\r\nit was, had failed because the assent of the Maritime Provinces could\r\nnot be secured; and for five years afterwards no progress had been\r\nmade. It was natural that Brown should be anxiously desirous that the\r\nplan for the reform of the union of the Canadas should not fail,\r\nwhatever else might happen.\r\n\r\nOn June 21st, Mr. Brown called a meeting of the members of the\r\nOpposition for Upper Canada. It was resolved, on motion of Mr. Hope\r\nMackenzie, \"that we approve of the course which has been pursued by\r\nMr. Brown in the negotiations with the government, and that we approve\r\nof the project of a federal union of the Canadas, with provision for\r\nthe inclusion of the Maritime Provinces and the North-West Territory,\r\nas one basis on which the constitutional difficulties now existing\r\ncould be settled.\" Thirty-four members voted for this motion, five\r\ndeclining to vote. A motion that three members of the Opposition\r\nshould enter the government was not so generally supported, eleven\r\nmembers, including Alexander Mackenzie and Oliver Mowat, voting in the\r\nnegative. The Lower Canadian Reformers held aloof, and in the\r\nsubsequent debate in the legislature, strongly opposed confederation.\r\n\r\nThere were many evidences of the keen interest taken by the\r\ngovernor-general (Monk) in the negotiations. On June 21st he wrote to\r\nMr. Brown: \"I think the success or failure of the negotiations which\r\nhave been going on for some days, with a view to the formation of a\r\nstrong government on a broad basis, depends very much on your\r\nconsenting to come into the cabinet.\r\n\r\n\"Under these circumstances I must again take the liberty of pressing\r\nupon you, by this note, my opinion of the grave responsibility which\r\nyou will take upon yourself if you refuse to do so.\r\n\r\n\"Those who have hitherto opposed your views have consented to join\r\nwith you in good faith for the purpose of extricating the province\r\nfrom what appears to me a very dangerous position.\r\n\r\n\"They have frankly offered to take up and endeavour to settle on\r\nprinciples satisfactory to all, the great constitutional question\r\nwhich you, by your energy and ability, have made your own.\r\n\r\n\"The details of that settlement must necessarily be the subject of\r\ngrave debate in the cabinet, and I confess I cannot see how you are to\r\ntake part in that discussion, or how your opinions can be brought to\r\nbear on the arrangement of the question, unless you occupy a place at\r\nthe council table.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I may, without impropriety, ask you to take these opinions\r\ninto consideration before you arrive at a final decision as to your\r\nown course.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Brown wrote home that he, in consenting to enter the cabinet, was\r\ninfluenced by the vote of the Reform members, by private letters from\r\nmany quarters, and still more by the extreme urgency of the\r\ngovernor-general. \"The thing that finally determined me was the fact,\r\nascertained by Mowat and myself, that unless we went in the whole\r\neffort for constitutional changes would break down, and the enormous\r\nadvantages gained by our negotiations probably be lost. Finally, at\r\nthree o'clock yester-day, I consented to enter the cabinet as\r\n'president of the council,' with other two seats in the cabinet at my\r\ndisposal--one of which Mowat will take, and probably Macdougall the\r\nother. We consented with great reluctance, but there was no help for\r\nit; and it was such a temptation to have possibly the power of\r\nsettling the sectional troubles of Canada forever. The announcement\r\nwas made in the House yester-day, and the excitement all over the\r\nprovince is intense. I send you an official copy of the proceedings\r\nduring the negotiations, from which you will see the whole story. By\r\nnext mail I intend to send you some extracts from the newspapers. The\r\nunanimity of sentiment is without example in this country, and were it\r\nnot that I know at their exact value the worth of newspaper\r\nlaudations, I might be puffed up a little in my own conceit. After the\r\nexplanations by ministers I had to make a speech, but was so excited\r\nand nervous at the events of the last few days that I nearly broke\r\ndown. However, after a little I got over it, and made (as Mowat\r\nalleges) the most telling speech I ever made. There was great cheering\r\nwhen I sat down, and many members from both sides crowded round me to\r\ncongratulate me. In short, the whole movement is a grand success, and\r\nI really believe will have an immense influence on the future\r\ndestinies of Canada.\"\r\n\r\nThe formation of the coalition cabinet was announced on June 30th.\r\nFoley, Buchanan and Simpson, members of the Upper Canadian section of\r\nthe Taché-Macdonald ministry, retired, and their places were taken by\r\nthe Hon. George Brown, Oliver Mowat, and William Macdougall. Otherwise\r\nthe ministry remained unchanged. Sir E. P. Taché, though a\r\nConservative, was acceptable to both parties, and was well fitted to\r\nhead a genuine coalition. But it must have been evident from the first\r\nthat the character of a coalition would not be long maintained. The\r\nReform party, which had just defeated the government in the\r\nlegislature, was represented by only three ministers out of twelve;\r\nand this, with Macdonald's skill in managing combinations of men, made\r\nit morally certain that the ministry must eventually become\r\nConservative, just as happened in the case of the coalition of 1854.\r\nBrown had asked that the Reformers be represented by four ministers\r\nfrom Upper Canada and two from Lower Canada, which would, as nearly as\r\npossible, have corresponded with the strength of his party in the\r\nlegislature. Galt and Macdonald represented that a change in the\r\npersonnel of the Lower Canadian section of the cabinet would disturb\r\nthe people and shake their confidence. The Lower Canadian Liberal\r\nleaders, Dorion and Holton, were adverse to the coalition scheme,\r\nregarding it as a mere device for enabling Macdonald and his friends\r\nto hold office.\r\n\r\nMowat and Brown were re-elected without difficulty, but Macdougall met\r\nwith strong opposition in North Ontario. Brown, who was working hard\r\nin his interests, found this opposition so strong among Conservatives\r\nthat he telegraphed to Macdonald, who sent a strong letter on behalf\r\nof Macdougall. Brown said that the opposition came chiefly from\r\nOrangemen. The result was that Macdougall, in spite of the assistance\r\nof the two leaders, was defeated by one hundred. He was subsequently\r\nelected for North Lanark. In other bye-elections the advocates of\r\nconfederation were generally successful. In the confederation debate,\r\nBrown said there had been twenty-five contests, fourteen for the\r\nUpper House and eleven for the Lower House, and that only one or two\r\nopponents of confederation had been elected.\r\n\r\nThere had been for some years an intermittent movement for the union\r\nof the Maritime Provinces, and in 1864 their legislatures had\r\nauthorized the holding of a convention at Charlottetown. Accordingly\r\neight members of the Canadian ministry visited Charlottetown, where\r\nthey were cordially welcomed. They dwelt on the advantage of\r\nsubstituting the larger for the smaller plan of union, and the result\r\nof their representations was that arrangements were made for the\r\nholding of a general conference at Quebec later in the year. The\r\nCanadian ministers made a tour through the Maritime Provinces,\r\nspeaking in public and familiarizing the people with the plan. At a\r\nbanquet in Halifax, Mr. Brown gave a full exposition of the project\r\nand its advantages in regard to defence, commerce, national strength\r\nand dignity, adding that it would end the petty strifes of a small\r\ncommunity, and elevate politics and politicians.\r\n\r\nThe scheme was destined to undergo a more severe ordeal in the\r\nMaritime Provinces than these festive gatherings. For the present,\r\nprogress was rapid, and the maritime tour was followed by the\r\nconference at Quebec, which opened on October 10th, 1864.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] Sir Richard Cartwright says also that the credit of Canada was\r\nvery low, largely because of the troubles of the Grand Trunk Railway\r\nCompany. _Memories of Confederation_, p. 3.\r\n\r\n[15] _Memories of Confederation._ An address delivered before the\r\nCanadian Club of Ottawa, January 20th, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE QUEBEC CONFERENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe conference was held with closed doors, so as to encourage free\r\ndiscussion. Some fragmentary notes have been preserved. One impression\r\nderived from this and other records is that the public men of that day\r\nhad been much impressed by the Civil War in the United States, by the\r\napparent weakness of the central authority there, and by the dangers\r\nof State sovereignty. Emphasis was laid upon the monarchical element\r\nof the proposed constitution for Canada, and upon the fact that powers\r\nnot expressly defined were to rest in the general, instead of the\r\nlocal, legislatures. In fact, Mr. Chandler, a representative of New\r\nBrunswick, complained that the proposed union was legislative, not\r\nfederal, and reduced the local governments to the status of municipal\r\ncorporations. In practice these residuary powers were not so\r\nformidable as they appeared; the defined powers of the local\r\nlegislatures were highly important, and were fully maintained, if not\r\nenlarged, as a result of the resolute attitude of Ontario under the\r\nMowat government. But the notion that Canada must avoid the dangers of\r\nState sovereignty is continually cropping up in the literature of\r\nconfederation. Friends and opponents of the new constitution made\r\nmuch of these mysterious residuary powers, and the Lower Canadian\r\nLiberals feared that they were being drawn into a union that would\r\ndestroy the liberties and imperil the cherished institutions of the\r\nFrench-Canadian people.\r\n\r\nAnother point is the extraordinary amount of time and labour given to\r\nthe constitution of the senate. \"The conference proceedings,\" wrote\r\nMr. Brown, \"get along very well, considering we were very near broken\r\nup on the question of the distribution of members in the Upper Chamber\r\nof the federal legislature, but fortunately, we have this morning got\r\nthe matter amicably compromised, after a loss of three days in\r\ndiscussing it.\" During the latter years of the union, the elective\r\nsystem had prevailed in Canada, and Mowat, Macdougall and others\r\nfavoured continuing this practice, but were overruled. Brown joined\r\nMacdonald in supporting the nominative system. His reasons were given\r\nin his speech in the legislature in 1865. He believed that two\r\nelective chambers were incompatible with the British parliamentary\r\nsystem. The Upper Chamber, if elected, might claim equal power with\r\nthe Lower, including power over money bills. It might amend money\r\nbills, might reject all legislation, and stop the machinery of\r\ngovernment. With a Conservative majority in one House, and a Reform\r\nmajority in the other, a dead-lock might occur. To the objection that\r\nthe change from the elective to the nominative system involved a\r\ndiminution of the power of the people, Mr. Brown answered that the\r\ngovernment of the day would be responsible for each appointment. It\r\nmust be admitted that this responsibility is of little practical\r\nvalue, and that Mr. Brown fully shared in the delusions of his time as\r\nto the manner in which the senate would be constituted, and the part\r\nit would play in the government of the country.\r\n\r\nA rupture was threatened also on the question of finance. A large\r\nnumber of local works which in Upper Canada were paid for by local\r\nmunicipal taxation, were in the Maritime Provinces provided out of the\r\nprovincial revenues. The adjustment was a difficult matter, and\r\nfinally it was found necessary for the financial representatives of\r\nthe different provinces to withdraw, for the purpose of constructing a\r\nscheme.\r\n\r\nOn October 28th the conference was concluded, and its resolutions\r\nsubstantially form the constitution of Canada. On October 31st Brown\r\nwrote: \"We got through our work at Quebec very well. The constitution\r\nis not exactly to my mind in all its details--but as a whole it is\r\nwonderful, really wonderful. When one thinks of all the fighting we\r\nhave had for fifteen years, and finds the very men who fought us every\r\ninch, now going far beyond what we asked, I am amazed and sometimes\r\nalarmed lest it all go to pieces yet. We have yet to pass the ordeal\r\nof public opinion in the several provinces, and sad, indeed, will it\r\nbe if the measure is not adopted by acclamation in them all. For Upper\r\nCanada we may well rejoice on the day it becomes law. Nearly all our\r\npast difficulties are ended by it, whatever new ones may arise.\"\r\n\r\nA journey made by the delegates through Canada after the draft was\r\ncompleted enabled Canadians to make the acquaintance of some men of\r\nmark in the Maritime Provinces, including Tilley, of New Brunswick,\r\nand Tupper, of Nova Scotia, and it evoked in Upper Canada warm\r\nexpressions of public feeling in favour of the new union. It is\r\nestimated that eight thousand people met the delegates at the railway\r\nstation in Toronto. At a dinner given in the Music Hall in that city,\r\nMr. Brown explained the new constitution fully. He frankly confessed\r\nthat he was a convert to the scheme of the Intercolonial Railway, for\r\nthe reason that it was essential to the union between Canada and the\r\nMaritime Provinces. The canal system was to be extended, and as soon\r\nas the finances would permit communication was to be opened with the\r\nNorth-West Territory. \"This was the first time,\" wrote Mr. Brown,\r\n\"that the confederation scheme was really laid open to the public. No\r\ndoubt--was right in saying that the French-Canadians were restive\r\nabout the scheme, but the feeling in favour of it is all but unanimous\r\nhere, and I think there is a good chance of carrying it. At any rate,\r\ncome what may, I can now get out of the affair and out of public life\r\nwith honour, for I have had placed on record a scheme that would bring\r\nto an end all the grievances of which Upper Canada has so long\r\ncomplained.\"\r\n\r\nThe British government gave its hearty blessing to the confederation,\r\nand the outlook was hopeful. In December, 1864, Mr. Brown sailed for\r\nEngland, for the purpose of obtaining the views of the British\r\ngovernment. He wrote from London to Mr. Macdonald that the scheme had\r\ngiven prodigious satisfaction. \"The ministry, the Conservatives and\r\nthe Manchester men are all delighted with it, and everything Canadian\r\nhas gone up in public estimation immensely.... Indeed, from all\r\nclasses of people you hear nothing but high praise of 'Canadian\r\nstatesmanship,' and loud anticipations of the great future before us.\r\nI am much concerned to observe, however, and I write it to you as a\r\nthing that must seriously be considered by all men taking a lead\r\nhereafter in Canadian public matters--that there is a manifest desire\r\nin almost every quarter, that ere long the British American colonies\r\nshould shift for themselves, and in some quarters evident regret that\r\nwe did not declare at once for independence. I am very sorry to\r\nobserve this, but it arises, I hope, from the fear of invasion of\r\nCanada by the United States, and will soon pass away with the cause\r\nthat excites it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE CONFEDERATION DEBATE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parliament of Canada assembled on January 19th, 1865, to consider\r\nthe resolutions of the Quebec conference. The first presentation of\r\nthe reasons for confederation was made in the Upper Chamber by the\r\npremier, Sir E. P. Taché. He described the measure as essential to\r\nBritish connection, to the preservation of \"our institutions, our\r\nlaws, and even our remembrances of the past.\" If the opportunity were\r\nallowed to pass by unimproved, Canada would be forced into the\r\nAmerican union by violence; or would be placed upon an inclined plane\r\nwhich would carry it there insensibly. Canada, during the winter, had\r\nno independent means of access to the sea, but was dependent on the\r\nfavour of a neighbour which, in several ways, had shown a hostile\r\nspirit. The people of the Northern States had an exaggerated idea of\r\nCanadian sympathy with the South, and the consequences of this\r\nmisapprehension were--first, the threatened abolition of the transit\r\nsystem; second, the discontinuance of reciprocity; third, a passport\r\nsystem, which was almost equivalent to a prohibition of intercourse.\r\nUnion with the Maritime Provinces would give Canada continuous and\r\nindependent access to the Atlantic; and the Maritime Provinces would\r\nbring into the common stock their magnificent harbours, their coal\r\nmines, their great fishing and shipping industries. Then he recounted\r\nthe difficulties that had occurred in the government of Canada, ending\r\nin dead-lock, and a condition \"bordering on civil strife.\" He declared\r\nthat Lower Canada had resisted representation by population under a\r\nlegislative union, but that if a federal union were obtained, it would\r\nbe tantamount to a separation of the provinces, and Lower Canada would\r\nthereby preserve its autonomy, together with all the institutions it\r\nheld so dear. These were the main arguments for confederation, and in\r\nthe speeches which followed on that side they were repeated, enforced,\r\nand illustrated in various ways.\r\n\r\nIn the assembly, Mr. John A. Macdonald, as attorney-general, gave a\r\nclear and concise description of the new constitution. He admitted\r\nthat he had preferred a legislative union, but had recognized that\r\nsuch a union would not have been accepted either by Lower Canada or\r\nthe Maritime Provinces. The union between Upper and Lower Canada,\r\nlegislative in name, had been federal in fact, there being, by tacit\r\nconsent and practice, a separate body of legislation for each part of\r\nthe province. He described the new scheme of government as a happy\r\ncombination of the strength of a legislative union with the freedom of\r\na federal union, and with protection to local interests. The\r\nconstitution of the United States was \"one of the most skilful works\r\nwhich human intelligence ever created; one of the most perfect\r\norganizations that ever governed a free people.\" Experience had shown\r\nthat its main defect was the doctrine of State sovereignty. This\r\nblemish was avoided in the Canadian constitution by vesting all\r\nresiduary powers in the central government and legislature. The\r\nCanadian system would also be distinguished from the American by the\r\nrecognition of monarchy and of the principle of responsible\r\ngovernment. The connection of Canada with Great Britain he regarded as\r\ntending towards a permanent alliance. \"The colonies are now in a\r\ntransition state. Gradually a different colonial system is being\r\ndeveloped; and it will become year by year less a case of dependence\r\non our part, and of overruling protection on the part of the mother\r\ncountry, and more a case of a hearty and cordial alliance. Instead of\r\nlooking upon us as a merely dependent colony, England will have in us\r\na friendly nation--a subordinate, but still a powerful people--to\r\nstand by her in North America, in peace or in war.\"\r\n\r\nBrown spoke on the night of February 8th, his speech, occupying four\r\nhours and a half in delivery, showing the marks of careful\r\npreparation. He drew an illustration from the mighty struggle that had\r\nwell-nigh rent the republic asunder, and was then within a few weeks\r\nof its close. \"We are striving,\" he said, \"to settle forever issues\r\nhardly less momentous than those that have rent the neighbouring\r\nrepublic and are now exposing it to all the horrors of civil war. Have\r\nwe not then great cause for thankfulness that we have found a better\r\nway for the solution of our troubles? And should not every one of us\r\nendeavour to rise to the magnitude of the occasion, and earnestly seek\r\nto deal with this question to the end, in the same candid and\r\nconciliatory spirit in which, so far, it has been discussed?\"\r\n\r\nHe warned the assembly that whatever else happened, the constitution\r\nof Canada would not remain unchanged. \"Something must be done. We\r\ncannot stand still. We cannot go back to chronic, sectional hostility\r\nand discord--to a state of perpetual ministerial crisis. The events of\r\nthe last eight months cannot be obliterated--the solemn admissions of\r\nmen of all parties can never be erased. The claims of Upper Canada for\r\njustice must be met, and met now. Every one who raises his voice in\r\nhostility to this measure is bound to keep before him, when he speaks,\r\nall the perilous consequences of its rejection. No man who has a true\r\nregard for the well-being of Canada can give a vote against this\r\nscheme unless he is prepared to offer, in amendment, some better\r\nremedy for the evils and injustice that have so long threatened the\r\npeace of our country.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first place, he said confederation would provide a complete\r\nremedy for the injustice of the system of parliamentary\r\nrepresentation, by giving Upper Canada, in the House of Commons, the\r\nnumber of members to which it was entitled by population. In the\r\nsenate, the principle of representation by population would not be\r\nmaintained, an equal number of senators being allotted to Ontario, to\r\nQuebec, and to the group of Maritime Provinces, without regard to\r\npopulation. Secondly, the plan would remedy the injustice of which\r\nUpper Canada had complained in regard to public expenditures. \"No\r\nlonger shall we have to complain that one section pays the cash while\r\nthe other spends it; hereafter they who pay will spend, and they who\r\nspend more than they ought, will bear the brunt. If we look back on\r\nour doings of the last fifteen years, I think it will be acknowledged\r\nthat the greatest jobs perpetrated were of a sectional character, that\r\nour fiercest contests were about local matters that stirred up\r\nsectional jealousies and indignation to their deepest depth.\"\r\nConfederation would end sectional discord between Upper and Lower\r\nCanada. Questions that used to excite sectional hostility and jealousy\r\nwere now removed from the common legislature to the legislatures of\r\nthe provinces. No man need be debarred from a public career because\r\nhis opinions, popular in his own province, were unpopular in another.\r\nAmong the local questions that had disturbed the peace of the common\r\nlegislature, he mentioned the construction of local works, the\r\nendowment of ecclesiastical institutions, the granting of money for\r\nsectarian purposes, and interference with school systems.\r\n\r\nHe advocated confederation because it would convert a group of\r\ninconsiderable colonies into a powerful union of four million people,\r\nwith a revenue of thirteen million dollars, a trade of one hundred and\r\nthirty-seven million five hundred thousand dollars, rich natural\r\nresources and important industries. Among these he dwelt at length on\r\nthe shipping of the Maritime Provinces. These were the days of the\r\nwooden ship, and Mr. Brown claimed that federated Canada would be the\r\nthird maritime power in the world. Confederation would give a new\r\nimpetus to immigration and settlement. Communication with the west\r\nwould be opened up, as soon as the state of the finances permitted.\r\nNegotiations had been carried on with the imperial government for the\r\naddition of the North-West Territories to Canada; and when those\r\nfertile plains were opened for settlement, there would be an immense\r\naddition to the products of Canada. The establishment of free trade\r\nbetween Canada and the Maritime Provinces would be some compensation\r\nfor the loss of trade with the United States, should the reciprocity\r\ntreaty be abrogated. It would enable the country to assume a larger\r\nshare of the burden of defence. The time had come when the people of\r\nthe United Kingdom would insist on a reconsideration of the military\r\nrelations of Canada to the empire, and that demand was just. Union\r\nwould facilitate common defence. \"The Civil War in the neighbouring\r\nrepublic--the possibility of war between Great Britain and the United\r\nStates; the threatened repeal of the reciprocity treaty; the\r\nthreatened abolition of the American bonding system for goods in\r\ntransit to and from these provinces; the unsettled position of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company; the changed feeling of England as to the\r\nrelations of Canada to the parent state; all combine at this moment to\r\narrest the earnest attention to the gravity of the situation and unite\r\nus all in one vigorous effort to meet the emergency like men.\"\r\n\r\nA strong speech against confederation was made by Dorion, an old\r\nfriend of Brown, a staunch Liberal, and a representative\r\nFrench-Canadian. He declared that he had seen no ground for changing\r\nhis opinion on two points--the substitution of an Upper Chamber,\r\nnominated by the Crown, for an elective body; and the construction of\r\nthe Intercolonial Railway, which he, with other Liberals, had always\r\nopposed. He had always admitted that representation by population was\r\na just principle; and in 1856 he had suggested, in the legislature,\r\nthe substitution of a federal for a legislative union of the Canadas;\r\nor failing this, representation by population, with such checks and\r\nguarantees as would secure local rights and interests, and preserve to\r\nLower Canada its cherished institutions. When the Brown-Dorion\r\ngovernment was formed, he had proposed a federation of the Canadas,\r\nbut with the distinct understanding that he would not attempt to carry\r\nsuch a measure without the consent of a majority of the people of\r\nLower Canada. From the document issued by the Lower Canadian Liberals\r\nin 1859, he quoted a passage in which it was laid down that the powers\r\ngiven to the central government should be only those that were\r\nessential, and that the local powers should be as ample as possible.\r\n\"All that belongs to matters of a purely local character, such as\r\neducation, the administration of justice, the militia, the laws\r\nrelating to property, police, etc., ought to be referred to the local\r\ngovernments, whose powers ought generally to extend to all subjects\r\nwhich would not be given to the general government.\" The vesting of\r\nresiduary powers in the provinces was an important difference between\r\nthis and the scheme of confederation; but the point most dwelt upon by\r\nDorion was the inclusion of the Maritime Provinces, which he strongly\r\nopposed.\r\n\r\nDorion denied that the difficulty about representation was the source\r\nof the movement for confederation. He contended that the agitation for\r\nrepresentation by population had died out, and that the real authors\r\nof confederation were the owners of the Grand Trunk Railway Company,\r\nwho stood to gain by the construction of the Intercolonial. \"The\r\nTaché-Macdonald government were defeated because the House condemned\r\nthem for taking without authority one hundred thousand dollars out of\r\nthe public chest for the Grand Trunk Railway, at a time when there had\r\nnot been a party vote on representation by population for one or two\r\nsessions.\" He declared that Macdonald had, in Brown's committee of\r\n1864, voted against confederation, and that he and his colleagues\r\nadopted the scheme simply to enable them to remain in office. Dorion\r\nalso criticized adversely the change in the constitution of the Upper\r\nChamber, from the elective to the nominative system. The Conservative\r\ninstincts of Macdonald and Cartier, he said, led them to strengthen\r\nthe power of the Crown at the expense of the people, and this\r\nconstitution was a specimen of their handiwork. \"With a\r\ngovernor-general appointed by the Crown; with local governors also\r\nappointed by the Crown; with legislative councils in the general\r\nlegislature, and in all the provinces, nominated by the Crown, we\r\nshall have the most illiberal constitution ever heard of in any\r\ngovernment where constitutional government prevails.\"\r\n\r\nHe objected to the power vested in the governor-general-in-council to\r\nveto the acts of local legislatures. His expectation was that a\r\nminority in the local legislature might appeal to their party friends\r\nat Ottawa to veto laws which they disliked, and that thus there would\r\nbe constant interference, agitation and strife between the central and\r\nthe local authorities. He suspected that the intention was ultimately\r\nto change the federal union to a legislative union. The scheme of\r\nconfederation was being carried without submission to the people. What\r\nwould prevent the change from a federal to a legislative union from\r\nbeing accomplished in a similar way? To this the people of Lower\r\nCanada would not submit. \"A million of inhabitants may seem a small\r\naffair to the mind of a philosopher who sits down to write out a\r\nconstitution. He may think it would be better that there should be but\r\none religion, one language and one system of laws; and he goes to work\r\nto frame institutions that will bring all to that desirable state; but\r\nI can tell the honourable gentleman that the history of every country\r\ngoes to show that not even by the power of the sword can such changes\r\nbe accomplished.\"\r\n\r\nWith some exaggeration Mr. Dorion struck at real faults in the scheme\r\nof confederation. The contention that the plan ought to have been\r\nsubmitted to the people is difficult to meet except upon the plea of\r\nnecessity, or the plea that the end justifies the means. There was\r\nassuredly no warrant for depriving the people of the power of electing\r\nthe second chamber; and the new method, appointment by the government\r\nof the day, has been as unsatisfactory in practice as it was unsound\r\nin principle. The federal veto on provincial laws has not been used to\r\nthe extent that Dorion feared. But when we consider how partisan\r\nconsiderations have governed appointments to the senate, we can\r\nscarcely say that there was no ground for the fear that the power of\r\ndisallowance would be similarly abused. Nor can we say that Mr. Dorion\r\nwas needlessly anxious about provincial rights, when we remember how\r\npersistently these have been attacked, and what strength, skill and\r\nresolution have been required to defend them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE MISSION TO ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nA new turn was given to the debate early in March by the defeat of the\r\nNew Brunswick government in a general election, which meant a defeat\r\nfor confederation, and by the arrival of news of an important debate\r\nin the House of Lords on the defences of Canada. The situation\r\nsuddenly became critical. That part of the confederation scheme which\r\nrelated to the Maritime Provinces was in grave danger of failure. At\r\nthe same time the long-standing controversy between the imperial and\r\ncolonial authorities as to the defence of Canada had come to a head.\r\nThe two subjects were intimately connected. The British government had\r\nbeen led to believe that if confederation were accomplished, the\r\ndefensive power of Canada would be much increased, and the new union\r\nwould be ready to assume larger obligations. From this time the tone\r\nof the debate is entirely changed. It ceases to be a philosophic\r\ndeliberation of the merits of the new scheme. A note of urgency and\r\nanxiety is found in the ministerial speeches; the previous question is\r\nmoved, and the proceedings hurried to a close, amid angry protests\r\nfrom the Opposition.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown wrote on March 5th: \"We are going to have a great scene in\r\nthe House to-day.... The government of New Brunswick appealed to the\r\npeople on confederation by a general election, and have got beaten.\r\nThis puts a serious obstacle in the way of our scheme, and we mean to\r\nact promptly and decidedly upon it. At three o'clock we are to\r\nannounce the necessity of carrying the resolutions at once, sending\r\nhome a deputation to England, and proroguing parliament without any\r\nunnecessary delay--say in a week.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcement was made to the House by Attorney-General Macdonald,\r\nwho laid much stress on the disappointment that would be occasioned in\r\nEngland by the abandonment of a scheme by which Canadian colonies\r\nshould cease to be a source of embarrassment, and become a source of\r\nstrength. The question of confederation was intimately connected with\r\nthe question of defence, and that was a question of the most imminent\r\nnecessity. The provincial government had been in continued\r\ncorrespondence with the home government as to defence \"against every\r\nhostile pressure, from whatever source it may come.\"\r\n\r\nA lively debate ensued. John Sandfield Macdonald said that the defeat\r\nof the New Brunswick government meant the defeat of the larger scheme\r\nof confederation, unless it was intended that the people should be\r\nbribed into acquiescence or bullied into submission. \"The Hon. Mr.\r\nTilley and his followers are routed, horse and foot, by the honest\r\npeople of the province, scouted by those whose interests he had\r\nbetrayed, and whose behests he had neglected; and I think his fate\r\nought to be a warning to those who adopted this scheme without\r\nauthority, and who ask the House to ratify it _en bloc_, without\r\nseeking to obtain the sanction of the people.\" Later on he charged the\r\nministers with the intention of manufacturing an entirely new bill,\r\nobtaining the sanction of the British government, and forcing it on\r\nthe Canadian people, as was done in 1840.\r\n\r\nThis charge was hotly resented by Brown, and it drew from John A.\r\nMacdonald a more explicit statement of the intentions of the\r\ngovernment. They would, if the legislature adopted the confederation\r\nresolutions, proceed to England, inform the imperial government of\r\nwhat had passed in Canada and New Brunswick, and take counsel with\r\nthat government as to the affairs of Canada, especially in regard to\r\ndefence and the reciprocity treaty. The legislature would then be\r\ncalled together again forthwith, the report of the conferences in\r\nEngland submitted, and the business relating to confederation\r\ncompleted.\r\n\r\nOn the following day Macdonald made another announcement, referring to\r\na debate in the House of Lords on February 20th, which he regarded as\r\nof the utmost importance. A report made by a Colonel Jervois on the\r\ndefences of Canada had been published, and the publication, exposing\r\nthe extreme weakness of Canada, was regarded as an official\r\nindiscretion. It asserted that under the arrangements then existing\r\nBritish and Canadian forces together could not defend the colony. Lord\r\nLyveden brought the question up in the House of Lords, and dwelt upon\r\nthe gravity of the situation created by the defencelessness of Canada\r\nand by the hostility of the United States. He held that Great Britain\r\nmust do one of two things: withdraw her troops and abandon the country\r\naltogether, or defend it with the full power of the empire. It was\r\nfolly to send troops out in driblets, and spend money in the same way.\r\nThe Earl de Grey and Ripon, replying for the government, said that\r\nJervois' report contained nothing that was not previously known about\r\nthe weakness of Canada. He explained the proposed arrangement by which\r\nthe imperial government was to fortify Quebec at a cost of two hundred\r\nthousand pounds, and Canada would undertake the defence of Montreal\r\nand the West.[16]\r\n\r\nCommenting on a report of this discussion, Mr. Macdonald said there\r\nhad been negotiations between the two governments, and that he hoped\r\nthese would result in full provision for the defence of Canada, both\r\neast and west. It was of the utmost importance that Canada should be\r\nrepresented in England at this juncture. In order to expedite the\r\ndebate by shutting out amendments, he moved the previous question.\r\n\r\nMacdonald's motion provoked charges of burking free discussion, and\r\ncounter-charges of obstruction, want of patriotism and inclinations\r\ntowards annexation. The debate lost its academic calm and became\r\nacrimonious. Holton's motion for an adjournment, for the purpose of\r\nobtaining further information as to the scheme, was ruled out of\r\norder. The same fate befell Dorion's motion for an adjournment of the\r\ndebate and an appeal to the people, on the ground that it involved\r\nfundamental changes in the political institutions and political\r\nrelations of the province; changes not contemplated at the last\r\ngeneral election.\r\n\r\nOn March 12th the main motion adopting the resolutions of the Quebec\r\nconference was carried by ninety-one to thirty-three. On the following\r\nday an amendment similar to Dorion's, for an appeal to the people, was\r\nmoved by the Hon. John Hillyard Cameron, of Peel, seconded by Matthew\r\nCrooks Cameron, of North Ontario. Undoubtedly the argument for\r\nsubmission to the people was strong, and was hardly met by Brown's\r\nvigorous speech in reply. But the overwhelming opinion of the House\r\nwas against delay, and on March 13th the discussion came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe prospects for the inclusion of the Maritime Provinces were now\r\npoor. Newfoundland and Prince Edward Island withdrew. A strong\r\nfeeling against confederation was arising in Nova Scotia, and it was\r\nproposed there to return to the original idea of a separate maritime\r\nunion. It was decided to ask the aid of the British government in\r\novercoming the hesitation of the Maritime Provinces. The British\r\nauthorities were pressing Canada to assume increased obligations as to\r\ndefence. Defence depended on confederation, and England, by exercising\r\nsome friendly pressure on New Brunswick, might promote both objects.\r\n\r\nThe committee appointed to confer with the British government was\r\ncomposed of Macdonald, Brown, Cartier and Galt. They met in England a\r\ncommittee of the imperial cabinet, Gladstone, Cardwell, the Duke of\r\nSomerset and Earl de Grey and Ripon. An agreement was arrived at as to\r\ndefence. Canada would undertake works of defence at and west of\r\nMontreal, and maintain a certain militia force; Great Britain would\r\ncomplete fortifications at Quebec, provide the whole armament and\r\nguarantee a loan for the sum necessary to construct the works\r\nundertaken by Canada, and in case of war would defend every portion of\r\nCanada with all the resources of the empire. An agreement was made as\r\nto the acquisition of the Hudson Bay Territory by Canada, and as to\r\nthe influence to be brought to bear on the Maritime Provinces. \"The\r\nidea of coercing the Maritime Provinces into the measure was never for\r\na moment entertained.\" The end sought was to impress upon them the\r\ngrave responsibility of thwarting a measure so pregnant with future\r\nprosperity to British America.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the mild language used in regard to New Brunswick, the\r\nfact that its consent was a vital part of the whole scheme must have\r\nbeen an incentive to heroic measures, and these were taken.\r\n\r\nOne of the causes of the defeat of the confederation government of New\r\nBrunswick had been the active hostility of the lieutenant-governor,\r\nMr. Arthur Hamilton Gordon, son of the Earl of Aberdeen. He was\r\nstrongly opposed to the change, and is believed to have gone to the\r\nlimit of his authority in aiding and encouraging its opponents in the\r\nelection of 1865. Soon afterwards he visited England, and it is\r\nbelieved that he was sent for by the home authorities and was taken to\r\ntask for his conduct, and instructed to assist in carrying out\r\nconfederation. A despatch from Cardwell, secretary of state for the\r\ncolonies, to Governor Gordon, expressed the strong and deliberate\r\nopinion of Her Majesty's government in favour of a union of all the\r\nNorth American colonies.[17]\r\n\r\nThe governor carried out his instructions with the zeal of a convert,\r\nshowed the despatch to the head of his government, set about\r\nconverting him also, and believed he had been partly successful. The\r\nsubstance of the despatch was inserted in the speech from the throne,\r\nwhen the legislature met on March 8th, 1866. The legislative council\r\nadopted an address asking for imperial legislation to unite the\r\nBritish North American colonies. The governor, without waiting for the\r\naction of the assembly, made a reply to the council, expressing\r\npleasure at their address, and declaring that he would transmit it to\r\nthe secretary of state for the colonies. Thereupon the Smith ministry\r\nresigned, contending that they ought to have been consulted about the\r\nreply, that the council, not having been elected by the people, had no\r\nauthority to ask the imperial parliament to pass a measure which the\r\npeople of New Brunswick had expressly rejected at the polls. A protest\r\nin similar terms might have been made in the legislative assembly, but\r\nthe opportunity was not given. A government favourable to\r\nconfederation was formed under Peter Mitchell, with Tilley as his\r\nchief lieutenant, and the legislature was dissolved.\r\n\r\nA threatened Fenian invasion helped to turn the tide of public\r\nopinion, and the confederate ministry was returned with a large\r\nmajority. That result, however desirable, did not sanctify the means\r\ntaken to bring about a verdict for confederation, which could hardly\r\nhave been more arbitrary.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[16] Hansard, House of Lords, February 20th, 1865.

Taché on July 30th,\r\n1865. By his age, his long experience, and a certain mild benignity of\r\ndisposition, Taché was admirably fitted to be the dean of the\r\ncoalition and the arbiter between its elements. He had served in\r\nReform and Conservative governments, but without incurring the\r\nreproach of overweening love of office. With his departure that of\r\nBrown became only a matter of time. To work with Macdonald as an equal\r\nwas a sufficiently disagreeable duty; to work under him, considering\r\nthe personal relations of the two men, would have been humiliating.\r\nPutting aside the question of where the blame for the long-standing\r\nfeud lay, it was inevitable that the association should be temporary\r\nand brief. On August 3rd the governer-general asked Mr. Macdonald to\r\nform an administration. Mr. Macdonald consented, obtained the assent\r\nof Mr. Cartier and consulted Mr. Brown. I quote from an authorized\r\nmemorandum of the conversation. \"Mr. Brown replied that he was quite\r\nprepared to enter into arrangements for the continuance of the\r\ngovernment in the same position as it occupied previous to the death\r\nof Sir Etienne P. Taché; but that the proposal now made involved a\r\ngrave departure from that position. The government, heretofore, had\r\nbeen a coalition of three political parties, each represented by an\r\nactive party leader, but all acting under one chief, who had ceased to\r\nbe actuated by strong party feelings or personal ambitions, and who\r\nwas well fitted to give confidence to all the three sections of the\r\ncoalition that the conditions which united them would be carried out\r\nin good faith to the very letter. Mr. Macdonald, Mr. Cartier and\r\nhimself [Mr. Brown] were, on the contrary, regarded as party leaders,\r\nwith party feelings and aspirations, and to place any one of them in\r\nan attitude of superiority to the others, with the vast advantage of\r\nthe premiership, would, in the public mind, lessen the security of\r\ngood faith, and seriously endanger the existence of the coalition. It\r\nwould be an entire change of the situation. Whichever of the three was\r\nso preferred, the act would amount to an abandonment of the coalition\r\nbasis, and a reconstruction of the government on party lines under a\r\nparty leader.\" When the coalition was formed, the Liberals were in a\r\nmajority in the legislature; for reasons of State they had\r\nrelinquished their party advantage, and a government was formed in\r\nwhich the Conservatives had nine members and the Liberals three. In\r\nwhat light would the Liberal party regard this new proposition? Mr.\r\nBrown suggested that an invitation be extended to some gentleman of\r\ngood position in the legislative council, under whom all parties could\r\nact with confidence, as successor to Colonel Taché. So far as to the\r\nparty. Speaking, however, for himself alone, Mr. Brown said he\r\noccupied the same position as in 1864. He stood prepared to give\r\noutside the ministry a frank and earnest support to any ministry that\r\nmight be formed for the purpose of carrying out confederation.\r\n\r\nMr. Macdonald replied that he had no personal feeling as to the\r\npremiership, and would readily stand aside; and he suggested the name\r\nof Mr. Cartier, as leader of the French-Canadians. Mr. Brown said that\r\nit would be necessary for him to consult with his political friends.\r\nSir Narcisse F. Belleau, a member of the executive council, was then\r\nproposed by Mr. Macdonald, and accepted by Mr. Brown, on condition\r\nthat the policy of confederation should be stated in precise terms.\r\nSir Narcisse Belleau became nominal prime minister of Canada, and the\r\ndifficulty was tided over for a few months.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement, however, was a mere makeshift. The objections set\r\nforth by Brown to Macdonald's assuming the title of leader applied\r\nwith equal force to his assuming the leadership in fact, as he\r\nnecessarily did under Sir Narcisse Belleau; the discussion over this\r\npoint, though couched in language of diplomatic courtesy, must have\r\nirritated both parties, and their relations grew steadily worse. The\r\nimmediate and assigned cause of the rupture was a disagreement in\r\nregard to negotiations for the renewal of the reciprocity treaty. It\r\nis admitted that it was only in part the real cause, and would not\r\nhave severed the relations between men who were personally and\r\npolitically in sympathy.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown had taken a deep interest in the subject of reciprocity. In\r\n1863 he was in communication with John Sandfield Macdonald, then\r\npremier of Canada, and Luther Holton, minister of finance. He dwelt on\r\nthe importance of opening communication with the American government\r\nduring the administration of Lincoln, whom he regarded as favourable\r\nto the renewal of the treaty. Seward, Lincoln's secretary of state,\r\nsuggested that Canada should have an agent at Washington, with whom he\r\nand Lord Lyons, the British ambassador, could confer on Canadian\r\nmatters. The premier asked Brown to go, saying that all his colleagues\r\nwere agreed upon his eminent fitness for the mission. Brown declined\r\nthe mission, contending that Mr. Holton, besides being fully\r\nqualified, was, by virtue of his official position as minister of\r\nfinance, the proper person to represent Canada. He kept urging the\r\nimportance of taking action early, before the American movement\r\nagainst the renewal of the treaty could gather headway. But neither\r\nthe Macdonald-Sicotte government nor its successor lived long enough\r\nto take action, and the opportunity was lost. The coalition government\r\nwas fully employed with other matters during 1864, and it was not\r\nuntil the spring of 1863 that the matter of reciprocity was taken up.\r\nIn the summer of that year the imperial government authorized the\r\nformation of a confederate council on reciprocity, consisting of\r\nrepresentation from Canada and the other North American colonies, and\r\npresided over by the governor-general. Brown and Galt were the\r\nrepresentatives of Canada on the council.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown was in the Maritime Provinces in November, 1865, on\r\ngovernment business. On his return to Toronto he was surprised to read\r\nin American papers a statement that Mr. Galt and Mr. Howland were\r\nnegotiating with the Committee of Ways and Means at Washington.\r\nExplanations were given by Galt at a meeting of the cabinet at Ottawa\r\non December 17th. Seward had told him that the treaty could not be\r\nrenewed, but that something might be done by reciprocal legislation.\r\nAfter some demur, Mr. Galt went on to discuss the matter on that\r\nbasis. He suggested the free exchange of natural products, and a\r\ndesignated list of manufactures. The customs duties on foreign goods\r\nwere to be assimilated as far as possible. Inland waters and canals\r\nmight be used in common, and maintained at the joint expense of the\r\ntwo countries. Mr. Galt followed up his narrative by proposing that a\r\nminute of council be adopted, ratifying what he had done, and\r\nauthorizing him to proceed to Washington and continue the\r\nnegotiations.\r\n\r\nThe discussion that followed lasted several days. Mr. Brown objected\r\nstrongly to the proceeding. He declared that \"Mr. Galt had flung at\r\nthe heads of the Americans every concession that we had in our power\r\nto make, and some that we certainly could not make, so that our case\r\nwas foreclosed before the commission was opened.\" He objected still\r\nmore strongly to the plan of reciprocal legislation, which would keep\r\nthe people of Canada \"dangling from year to year on the legislation of\r\nthe American congress, looking to Washington instead of to Ottawa as\r\nthe controller of their commerce and prosperity.\" The scheme was\r\nadmirably designed by the Americans to promote annexation. Before each\r\ncongress the United States press would contain articles threatening\r\nruin to Canadian trade. The Maritime Provinces would take offence at\r\nbeing ignored, and confederation as well as reciprocity might be lost.\r\nHis own proposal was to treat Mr. Galt's proceedings at Washington as\r\nunofficial, call the confederate council, and begin anew to \"make a\r\ndead set to have this reciprocal legislation idea upset before\r\nproceeding with the discussion.\"\r\n\r\nGalt at length suggested a compromise. His proceedings at Washington\r\nwere to be treated as unofficial, and no order-in-council passed. Galt\r\nand Howland were to be sent to Washington to obtain a treaty if\r\npossible, and if not to learn what terms could be arranged, and report\r\nto the government.\r\n\r\nBrown regarded this motion as intended to remove him from the\r\nconfederate council, and substitute Mr. Howland, and said so; but he\r\ndeclared that he would accept the compromise nevertheless. It\r\nappeared, however, that there had been a misunderstanding as to the\r\nrecording of a minute of the proceedings. The first minute was\r\nwithdrawn; but as Mr. Brown considered that the second minute still\r\nsanctioned the idea of reciprocal legislation, he refused to sign it,\r\nand decided to place his resignation in the hands of the premier, and\r\nto wait upon the governor-general. After hearing the explanation, His\r\nExcellency said: \"Then, Mr. Brown, I am called upon to decide between\r\nyour policy and that of the other members of the government?\" Mr.\r\nBrown replied, \"Yes, sir, and if I am allowed to give advice in the\r\nmatter, I should say that the government ought to be sustained, though\r\nthe decision is against myself. I consider the great question of\r\nconfederation as of far greater consequence to the country than\r\nreciprocity negotiations. My resignation may aid in preventing their\r\npolicy on the reciprocity question from being carried out, or at least\r\ncall forth a full expression of opinion on the subject, and the\r\ngovernment should be sustained, if wrong in this, for the sake of\r\nconfederation.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate in council had occupied several days, and had evidently\r\naroused strong feelings. Undoubtedly Mr. Brown's decision was affected\r\nby the affront that he considered had been put upon him by virtually\r\nremoving him from the confederate council and sending Mr. Howland\r\ninstead of himself to Washington as the colleague of Mr. Galt. He\r\ndisapproved on public grounds of the policy of the government, and he\r\nresented the manner in which he had been ignored throughout the\r\ntransaction. On the day after the rupture Mr. Cartier wrote Mr. Brown\r\nasking him whether he could reconsider his resignation. Mr. Brown\r\nreplied, \"I have received your kind note, and think it right to state\r\nfrankly at once that the step I have taken cannot be revoked. The\r\ninterests involved are too great. I think a very great blunder has\r\nbeen committed in a matter involving the most important interests of\r\nthe country, and that the order-in-council you have passed endorses\r\nthat blunder and authorizes persistence in it.... I confess I was much\r\nannoyed at the personal affront offered me, but that feeling has\r\npassed away in view of the serious character of the matter at issue,\r\nwhich casts all personal feeling aside.\"\r\n\r\nIf it were necessary to seek for justification of Mr. Brown's action\r\nin leaving the ministry at this time, it might be found either in his\r\ndisagreement with the government on the question of policy, or in the\r\ntreatment accorded to him by his colleagues. Sandfield Macdonald and\r\nhis colleagues had on a former occasion recognized Mr. Brown's eminent\r\nfitness to represent Canada in the negotiations at Washington, not\r\nonly because of his thorough acquaintance with the subject, but\r\nbecause of his steadily maintained attitude of friendship for the\r\nNorth. He was a member of the confederate council on reciprocity. His\r\nposition in the ministry was not that of a subordinate, but of the\r\nrepresentative of a powerful party. In resenting the manner in which\r\nhis position was ignored, he does not seem to have exceeded the bounds\r\nof proper self-assertion. However, this controversy assumes less\r\nimportance if it is recognized that the rupture was inevitable. The\r\nprecise time or occasion is of less importance than the force which\r\nwas always and under all circumstances operating to draw Mr. Brown\r\naway from an association injurious to himself and to Liberalism, in\r\nits broad sense as well as in its party sense, and to his influence as\r\na public man. This had better be considered in another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nCONFEDERATION AND THE PARTIES\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are to consider now the long-vexed question of the connection of\r\nMr. Brown with the coalition of 1864. Ought he to have entered the\r\ncoalition government? Having entered it, was he justified in leaving\r\nit in 1865? Holton and Dorion told him that by his action in 1864, he\r\nhad sacrificed his own party interests to those of John A. Macdonald;\r\nthat Macdonald was in serious political difficulty, and had been\r\ndefeated in the legislature; that he seized upon Brown's suggestion\r\nmerely as a means of keeping himself in office; that for the sake of\r\noffice he accepted the idea of confederation, after having voted\r\nagainst it in Brown's committee. A most wise and faithful friend,\r\nAlexander Mackenzie, thought that Reformers should accept no\r\nrepresentation in the cabinet, but that they should give confederation\r\nan outside support. That Macdonald and his party were immensely\r\nbenefitted by Brown's action, there can be no doubt. For several years\r\nthey had either been in Opposition, or in office under a most\r\nprecarious tenure, depending entirely upon a majority from Lower\r\nCanada. By Brown's action they were suddenly invested with an\r\noverwhelming majority, and they had an interrupted lease of power for\r\nthe nine years between the coalition and the Pacific Scandal.\r\nAdmitting that the interest of the country warranted this sacrifice of\r\nthe interests of the Liberal party, we have still to consider whether\r\nit was wise for Mr. Brown to enter the ministry, and especially to\r\nenter it on the conditions that existed. The Lower Canadian Liberals\r\nwere not represented, partly because Dorion and Holton held back, and\r\npartly because of the prejudice of Taché and Cartier against the\r\nRouges; and this exclusion was a serious defect in a ministry supposed\r\nto be formed on a broad and patriotic basis. The result was, that\r\nwhile the Liberals were in a majority in the legislature, they had\r\nonly three representatives in a ministry of twelve. Such a government,\r\nwith its dominant Conservative section led by a master in the handling\r\nof political combinations, was bound to lose its character of a\r\ncoalition, and become Conservative out and out.\r\n\r\nA broader question is involved than that of the mere party advantage\r\nobtained by Macdonald and his party in the retention of power and\r\npatronage. There was grave danger to the essential principles of\r\nLiberalism, of which Brown was the appointed guardian. Holton put this\r\nin a remarkable way during the debate on confederation. It was at the\r\ntime when Macdonald had moved the previous question, when the\r\ncoalition government was hurrying the debate to a conclusion, in the\r\nface of indignant protests and demands that the scheme should be\r\nsubmitted to the people. Holton told Brown that he had destroyed the\r\nLiberal party. Henceforth its members would be known as those who once\r\nranged themselves together, in Upper and Lower Canada, under the\r\nLiberal banner. Then followed this remarkable appeal to his old\r\nfriend: \"Most of us remember--those of us who have been for a few\r\nyears in public life in this country must remember--a very striking\r\nspeech delivered by the honourable member for South Oxford in Toronto\r\nin the session of 1856 or 1857, in which he described the path of the\r\nattorney-general [Macdonald] as studded all along by the gravestones\r\nof his slaughtered colleagues. Well, there are not wanting those who\r\nthink they can descry, in the not very remote distance, a yawning\r\ngrave waiting for the noblest victim of them all. And I very much fear\r\nthat unless the honourable gentleman has the courage to assert his own\r\noriginal strength--and he has great strength--and to discard the\r\nblandishments and the sweets of office, and to plant himself where he\r\nstood formerly, in the affections and confidence of the people of this\r\ncountry, as the foremost defender of the rights of the people, as the\r\nforemost champion of the privileges of a free parliament--unless he\r\nhastens to do that, I very much fear that he too may fall a victim,\r\nthe noblest victim of them all, to the arts, if not the arms of the\r\nfell destroyer.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a little humorous exaggeration in the personal references to\r\nMacdonald, for Holton and he were on friendly terms. But there was\r\nalso matter for serious thought in his words. Though Macdonald had\r\noutgrown the fossil Toryism that opposed responsible government, he\r\nwas essentially Conservative; and there was something not democratic\r\nin his habit of dealing with individuals rather than with people in\r\nthe mass, and of accomplishing his ends by private letters and\r\ninterviews, and by other forms of personal influence, rather than by\r\nthe public advocacy of causes. Association with him was injurious to\r\nmen of essentially Liberal and democratic tendencies, and\r\nsubordination was fatal, if not to their usefulness, at least to their\r\nLiberal ideals. Macdougall and Howland remained in the ministry until\r\nconfederation was achieved, and found reasons for remaining there\r\nafterwards. At the Reform convention of 1867, when the relation of the\r\nLiberal party to the so-called coalition was considered, they defended\r\ntheir position with skill and force, but the association of one with\r\nMacdonald was very brief, and of the other very unhappy. Mr. Howland\r\nwas not a very keen politician, and a year after confederation was\r\naccomplished he accepted the position of lieutenant-governor of\r\nOntario. Mr. Macdougall had an unsatisfactory career as a minister,\r\nwith an unhappy termination. He was clearly out of his element. Mr.\r\nTilley was described as a Liberal, but there was nothing to\r\ndistinguish him from his Conservative colleagues in his methods or his\r\nutterances, and he became the champion of the essentially Conservative\r\npolicy of protection.\r\n\r\nBut the most notable example of the truth of Holton's words and the\r\nsoundness of his advice was Joseph Howe. Howe was in Nova Scotia \"the\r\nforemost defender of the rights of people, the foremost champion of\r\nthe privileges of free parliaments.\" He had opposed the inclusion of\r\nNova Scotia on the solid ground that it was accomplished by arbitrary\r\nmeans. At length he bowed to the inevitable. In ceasing to encourage a\r\nuseless and dangerous agitation he stood on patriotic ground. But in\r\nan evil hour he was persuaded to seal his submission by joining the\r\nMacdonald government, and thenceforth his influence was at an end. His\r\nbiographer says that Howe's four years in Sir John Macdonald's cabinet\r\nare the least glorious of his whole career. \"Howe had been accustomed\r\nall his life to lead and control events. He found himself a member of\r\na government of which Sir John Macdonald was the supreme head, and of\r\na cast of mind totally different from his own. Sir John Macdonald was\r\na shrewd political manager, an opportunist whose unfailing judgment\r\nled him unerringly to pursue the course most likely to succeed each\r\nhour, each day, each year. Howe had the genius of a bold Reformer, a\r\ncourageous and creative type of mind, who thought in continents,\r\ndreamed dreams and conceived great ideas. Sir John Macdonald busied\r\nhimself with what concerned the immediate interests of the hour in\r\nwhich he was then living, and yet Sir John Macdonald was a leader who\r\npermitted no insubordination. Sir Georges Cartier, a man not to be\r\nnamed in the same breath with Howe as a statesman, was, nevertheless,\r\na thousand times of more moment and concern with his band of Bleu\r\nfollowers in the House of Commons, than a dozen Howes, and the\r\nconsequence is that we find for four years the great old man playing\r\nsecond fiddle to his inferiors, and cutting a far from heroic figure\r\nin the arena.\"[18] What Holton said by way of warning to Brown was\r\nrealized in the case of Howe. He was \"the noblest victim of them all.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of Liberalism and of his influence as a public\r\nman, Brown did not leave the ministry a moment too soon; and there is\r\nmuch to be said in favour of Mackenzie's view that he ought to have\r\nrefused to enter the coalition at all, and confined himself to giving\r\nhis general support to confederation. By this means he would not have\r\nbeen responsible for the methods by which the new constitution was\r\nbrought into effect, methods that were in many respects repugnant to\r\nthose essential principles of Liberalism of which Brown had been one\r\nof the foremost champions. At almost every stage in the proceedings\r\nthere was a violation of those rights of self-government which had\r\nbeen so hardly won by Canada, Nova Scotia and New Brunswick. The\r\nQuebec conference was a meeting of persons who had been chosen to\r\nadminister the affairs of the various British provinces under their\r\nestablished constitutions, not to make a new constitution. Its\r\ndeliberations were secret. It proceeded, without a mandate from the\r\npeople, to create a new governing body, whose powers were obtained at\r\nthe expense of those of the provinces. With the same lack of popular\r\nauthority, it declared that the provinces should have only those\r\npowers which were expressly designated, and that the reserve of power\r\nshould be in the central governing body. Had this body been created\r\nfor the Canadas alone, this proceeding might have been justified, for\r\nthey were already joined in a legislative union, though by practice\r\nand consent some features of federalism prevailed. But Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick were separate, self-governing communities, and it was\r\nfor them, not for the Quebec conference, to say what powers they would\r\ngrant and what powers they would retain. Again the people of Canada\r\nhad declared that the second chamber should be elected, not appointed\r\nby the Crown. The Quebec conference, without consulting the people of\r\nCanada, reverted to the discarded system of nomination, and added the\r\nsenate to the vast body of patronage at the disposal of the federal\r\ngovernment. The constitution adopted by this body was not, except in\r\nthe case of New Brunswick, submitted to the people, and it can hardly\r\nbe said that it was freely debated in the parliament of Canada, for it\r\nwas declared that it was in the nature of a treaty, and must be\r\naccepted or rejected as a whole. In the midst of this debate the\r\npeople of New Brunswick passed upon the scheme in a general election,\r\nand condemned it in the most decisive and explicit way. The British\r\ngovernment was then induced to bring pressure to bear upon the\r\nprovince; and while it was contended that this pressure was only in\r\nthe form of friendly advice it was otherwise interpreted by the\r\ngovernor, who strained his powers to compel the ministry to act in\r\ndirect contravention of its mandate from the people, and when it\r\nresisted, forced it out of office. It is true that in a subsequent\r\nelection this decision was reversed; but that is not a justification\r\nfor the means adopted to bring about this result. It is no\r\nexaggeration to say that Nova Scotia was forced into the union against\r\nthe express desire of a large majority of its people. There are\r\narguments by which these proceedings may be defended, but they are not\r\narguments that lie in the mouth of a Liberal. And if we say that the\r\nconfederation, in spite of these taints in its origin, has worked well\r\nand has solved the difficulties of Canada, we use an argument which\r\nmight justify the forcible annexation of a country by a powerful\r\nneighbour.\r\n\r\nAgain, there was much force in Dorion's contention that the new\r\nconstitution was an illiberal constitution, increasing those powers of\r\nthe executive which were already too large. To the inordinate strength\r\nof the executive, under the delusive name of the Crown, may be traced\r\nmany of the worst evils of Canadian politics: the abuse of the\r\nprerogative of dissolution, the delay in holding bye-elections, the\r\ngerrymandering of the constituencies by a parliament registering the\r\ndecree of a government. To these powers of the government the\r\nConfederation Act added that of filling one branch of the legislature\r\nwith its own nominees. By the power of disallowance, by the equivocal\r\nlanguage used in regard to education, and in regard to the creation of\r\nnew provinces, pretexts were furnished for federal interference in\r\nlocal affairs. But for the resolute opposition of Mowat and his\r\ncolleagues, the subordination of the provinces to the central\r\nauthority would have gone very far towards realizing Macdonald's ideal\r\nof a legislative union; and recent events have shown that the danger\r\nof centralization is by no means at an end.\r\n\r\nIt was a true, liberal and patriotic impulse that induced Brown to\r\noffer his aid in breaking the dead-lock of 1864. He desired that Upper\r\nCanada should be fairly represented in parliament, and should have\r\nfreedom to manage its local affairs. He desired that the Maritime\r\nProvinces and the North-West should, in the course of time, be\r\nbrought in on similar terms of freedom. But by joining the coalition\r\nhe became a participant in a different course of procedure; and if we\r\ngive him a large, perhaps the largest share, of the credit for the\r\nultimate benefits of confederation, we cannot divest him of\r\nresponsibility for the methods by which it was brought about, so long,\r\nat least, as he remained a member of the government.\r\n\r\nIn the year and a half that elapsed between his withdrawal from the\r\ngovernment and the first general election under the new constitution,\r\nhe had a somewhat difficult part to play. He had to aid in the work of\r\ncarrying confederation, and at the same time to aid in the work of\r\nre-organizing the Liberal party, which had been temporarily divided\r\nand weakened by the new issue introduced into politics. In the Reform\r\nconvention of 1867 the attitude of the party towards confederation was\r\nconsidered. It was resolved that \"while the new constitution contained\r\nobvious defects, it was, on the whole, based upon equitable principles\r\nand should be accepted with the determination to work it loyally and\r\npatiently, and to provide such amendments as experience from year to\r\nyear may prove to be expedient.\" It was declared that coalitions of\r\nopposing political parties for ordinary administrative purposes\r\nresulted in corruption, extravagance and the abandonment of principle;\r\nthat the coalition of 1864 could be justified only on the ground of\r\nimperious necessity, as the only available means of obtaining just\r\nrepresentation for Upper Canada, and should come to an end when that\r\nobject was attained; and that the temporary alliance of the Reform and\r\nConservative parties should cease. Howland and Macdougall, who had\r\ndecided to remain in the ministry, strove to maintain that it was a\r\ntrue coalition, and that the old issues that divided the parties were\r\nat an end; and their bearing before a hostile audience was tactful and\r\ncourageous. But Brown and his friends carried all before them.\r\n\r\nBrown argued strongly against the proposal to turn the coalition\r\nformed for confederation into a coalition for ordinary administrative\r\npurposes; and in a passage of unusual fervour he asked whether his\r\nReform friends were to be subjected to the humiliation of following in\r\nthe train of John A. Macdonald.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to understand how so chimerical a notion as a\r\nnon-party government led by Macdonald could have been entertained by\r\npractical politicians. A permanent position in a Macdonald ministry\r\nwould have been out of the question for Brown, not only because of his\r\nstanding as a public man, but because of his control of the _Globe_,\r\nwhich under such an arrangement would have been reduced to the\r\nposition of an organ of the Conservative government. There were also\r\nall the elements of a powerful Liberal party, which soon after\r\nconfederation rallied its forces and overthrew Sir John Macdonald's\r\ngovernment at Ottawa, and the coalition government he had established\r\nat Toronto. Giving Macdougall every credit for good intentions, it\r\nmust be admitted that he committed an error in casting in his\r\npolitical fortunes with Sir John Macdonald, and that both he and\r\nJoseph Howe would have found more freedom, more scope for their\r\nenergies and a wider field of usefulness, in fighting by the side of\r\nMackenzie and Blake.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Longley's _Joseph Howe_, \"Makers of Canada\" series, pp. 228, 229.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nCANADA AND THE GREAT WEST\r\n\r\n\r\nVery soon after his arrival in Canada, Mr. Brown became deeply\r\ninterested in the North-West Territories. He was thrown into contact\r\nwith men who knew the value of the country and desired to see it\r\nopened for settlement. One of these was Robert Baldwin Sullivan, who,\r\nduring the struggle for responsible government, wrote a series of\r\nbrilliant letters over the signature of \"Legion\" advocating that\r\nprinciple, and who was for a time provincial secretary in the\r\nBaldwin-Lafontaine government. In 1847, Mr. Sullivan delivered, in the\r\nMechanics' Institute, Toronto, an address on the North-West\r\nTerritories, which was published in full in the _Globe_. The Oregon\r\nsettlement had recently been made, and the great westward trek of the\r\nAmericans was in progress. Sullivan uttered the warning that the\r\nAmericans would occupy and become masters of the British western\r\nterritory, and outflank Canada, unless steps were taken to settle and\r\ndevelop it by British subjects. There was at this time much\r\nmisconception of the character of the country, and one is surprised by\r\nthe very accurate knowledge shown by Mr. Sullivan in regard to the\r\nresources of the country, its coal measures as well as its wheat\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown also obtained much information and assistance from Mr.\r\nIsbester, a \"native of the country, who by his energy, ability and\r\nintelligence had raised himself from the position of a successful\r\nscholar at one of the schools of the settlement to that of a graduate\r\nof one of the British universities, and to a teacher of considerable\r\nrank. This gentleman had succeeded in inducing prominent members of\r\nthe House of Commons to interest themselves in the subject of appeals\r\nwhich, through him, were constantly being made against the injustice\r\nand persecution which the colonists of the Red River Settlement were\r\nsuffering.\"[19]\r\n\r\nMr. Brown said that his attention was first drawn to the subject by a\r\ndeputation sent to England by the people of the Red River Settlement\r\nto complain that the country was ill-governed by the Hudson's Bay\r\nCompany, and to pray that the territory might be thrown open for\r\nsettlement. \"The movement,\" said Mr. Brown, \"was well received by the\r\nmost prominent statesmen of Britain. The absurdity of so vast a\r\ncountry remaining in the hands of a trading company was readily\r\nadmitted; and I well remember that Mr. Gladstone then made an\r\nexcellent speech in the Commons, as he has recently done, admitting\r\nthat the charter of the company was not valid, and that the matter\r\nshould be dealt with by legislation. But the difficulty that\r\nconstantly presented itself was what should be done with the\r\nterritory were the charter broken up; what government should replace\r\nthat of the company. The idea struck Mr. Isbester, a most able and\r\nenlightened member of the Red River deputation to London, that this\r\ndifficulty would be met at once were Canada to step in and claim the\r\nright to the territory. Through a mutual friend, I was communicated\r\nwith on the subject, and agreed to have the question thoroughly\r\nagitated before the expiry of the company's charter in 1859. I have\r\nsince given the subject some study, and have on various occasions\r\nbrought it before the public.\" Mr. Brown referred to the matter in his\r\nmaiden speech in parliament in 1851, and in 1854 and again in 1856 he\r\ngave notice of motion for a committee of inquiry, but was interrupted\r\nby other business. In 1852, the _Globe_ contained an article so\r\nremarkable in its knowledge of the country that it may be reproduced\r\nhere in part.\r\n\r\n\"It is a remarkable circumstance that so little attention has been\r\npaid in Canada to the immense tract of country lying to the north of\r\nour boundary line, and known as the Hudson's Bay Company's Territory.\r\nThere can be no question that the injurious and demoralizing sway of\r\nthat company over a region of four millions of square miles, will, ere\r\nlong, be brought to an end, and that the destinies of this immense\r\ncountry will be united with our own. It is unpardonable that\r\ncivilization should be excluded from half a continent, on at best but\r\na doubtful right of ownership, for the benefit of two hundred and\r\nthirty-two shareholders.\r\n\r\n\"Our present purpose is not, however, with the validity of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company's claim to the country north of the Canadian\r\nline--but to call attention to the value of that region, and the vast\r\ncommercial importance to the country and especially to this section,\r\nwhich must, ere long, attach to it. The too general impression\r\nentertained is, that the territory in question is a frozen wilderness,\r\nincapable of cultivation and utterly unfit for colonization. This\r\nimpression was undoubtedly set afloat, and has been maintained, for\r\nits own very evident purposes. So long as that opinion could be kept\r\nup, their charter was not likely to be disturbed. But light has been\r\nbreaking in on the subject in spite of their efforts to keep it out.\r\nIn a recent work by Mr. Edward Fitzgerald, it is stated that 'there is\r\nnot a more favourable situation on the face of the earth for the\r\nemployment of agricultural industry than the locality of the Red\r\nRiver.' Mr. Fitzgerald asserts that there are five hundred thousand\r\nsquare miles of soil, a great part of which is favourable for\r\nsettlement and agriculture, and all so well supplied with game as to\r\ngive great facility for colonization. Here is a field for Canadian\r\nenterprise.\r\n\r\n\"The distance between Fort William and the Red River Settlement is\r\nabout five hundred miles, and there is said to be water communication\r\nby river and lake all the way. But westward, beyond the Red River\r\nSettlement, there is said to be a magnificent country, through which\r\nthe Saskatchewan River extends, and is navigable for boats and canoes\r\nthrough a course of one thousand four hundred miles.\r\n\r\n\"Much has been said of the extreme cold of the country, as indicated\r\nby the thermometer. It is well known, however, that it is not the\r\ndegree but the character of the cold which renders it obnoxious to\r\nmen, and the climate of this country is quite as agreeable, if not\r\nmore so, than the best part of Canada. The height of the latitude\r\ngives no clue whatever to the degree of cold or to the nature of the\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\n\"Let any one look at the map, and if he can fancy the tenth part that\r\nis affirmed of the wide region of country stretching westward to the\r\nRocky Mountains, he may form some idea of the profitable commerce\r\nwhich will soon pass through Lake Superior. Independent of the hope\r\nthat the high road to the Pacific may yet take this direction, there\r\nis a field for enterprise presented, sufficient to satiate the warmest\r\nimagination.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, until the year 1856 that public attention was\r\naroused to the importance of the subject. In the autumn of that year\r\nthere was a series of letters in the _Globe_ signed \"Huron,\" drawing\r\nattention to the importance of the western country, attacking the\r\nadministration of the Hudson's Bay Company, and suggesting that the\r\ninhabitants, unless relieved, might seek to place the country under\r\nAmerican government. In December 1856, there was a meeting of the\r\nToronto Board of Trade at which addresses were delivered by Alan\r\nMcDonnell and Captain Kennedy. Captain Kennedy said that he had lived\r\nfor a quarter of a century in the territory in question, had eight or\r\nnine years before the meeting endeavoured to call attention to the\r\ncountry through the newspapers and had written a letter to Lord Elgin.\r\nHe declared that the most important work before Canada was the\r\nsettlement of two hundred and seventy-nine million acres of land lying\r\nwest of the Lakes. The Board of Trade passed a resolution declaring\r\nthat the claim of the Hudson's Bay Company to the exclusive right to\r\ntrade in the country was injurious to the rights of the people of the\r\nterritory and of British North America. The Board also petitioned the\r\nlegislature to ascertain the rights of the Hudson's Bay Company, and\r\nto protect the interests of Canada. A few days afterwards the _Globe_\r\nsaid that the time had come to act, and thenceforward it carried on a\r\nvigorous campaign for the opening up of the territory to settlement\r\nand the establishment of communication with Canada.\r\n\r\nDuring the year 1856, Mr. Brown addressed many meetings on the subject\r\nof the working of the union. He opposed the separation of the Canadas,\r\nproposed by some as a measure of relief for the grievances of Upper\r\nCanada. This would bring Canada back to the day of small things; he\r\nadvocated expansion to the westward. William Macdougall, then a member\r\nof the _Globe_ staff, was also an enthusiastic advocate of the union\r\nof the North-West Territories with Canada. In an article reviewing the\r\nevents of the year 1856, the _Globe_ said: \"This year will be\r\nremembered as that in which the public mind was first aroused to the\r\nnecessity of uniting to Canada the great tract of British American\r\nterritory lying to the north-west, then in the occupation of a great\r\ntrading monopoly. The year 1856 has only seen the birth of this\r\nmovement. Let us hope that 1857 will see it crowned with success.\"\r\n\r\nIn January 1857, a convention of Reformers in Toronto adopted a\r\nplatform including free trade, uniform legislation for both provinces,\r\nrepresentation by population, national and non-sectarian education,\r\nand the incorporation of the Hudson Bay Territory. It was resolved\r\n\"that the country known as the Hudson Bay Territory ought no longer to\r\nbe cut off from civilization, that it is the duty of the legislature\r\nand executive of Canada to open negotiations with the imperial\r\ngovernment for the incorporation of the said territory as Canadian\r\nsoil.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Globe's_ proposals at this early date provoked the merriment of\r\nsome of its contemporaries. The Niagara _Mail_, January 1857, said:\r\n\"The Toronto _Globe_ comes out with a new and remarkable platform, one\r\nof the planks of which is the annexation of the frozen regions of the\r\nHudson Bay Territory to Canada. Lord have mercy on us! Canada has\r\nalready a stiff reputation for cold in the world, but it is unfeeling\r\nin the _Globe_ to want to make it deserve the reproach.\" The _Globe_\r\nadvised its contemporary not to commit itself hastily against the\r\nannexation of the North-West, \"for it will assuredly be one of the\r\nstrongest planks in our platform.\"\r\n\r\nAnother sceptic was the Montreal _Transcript_, which declared that the\r\nfertile spots in the territory were small and separated by immense\r\ndistances, and described the Red River region as an oasis in the midst\r\nof a desert, \"a vast treeless prairie on which scarcely a shrub is to\r\nbe seen.\" The climate was unfavourable to the growth of grain. The\r\nsummer, though warm enough, was too short in duration, so that even\r\nthe few fertile spots could \"with difficulty mature a small potato or\r\ncabbage.\" The subject seemed to be constantly in Brown's mind, and he\r\nreferred to it frequently in public addresses. After the general\r\nelection of 1857-8 a banquet was given at Belleville to celebrate the\r\nreturn of Mr. Wallbridge for Hastings. Mr. Brown there referred to a\r\nproposal to dissolve the union. He was for giving the union a fair\r\ntrial. \"Who can look at the map of this continent and mark the vast\r\nportion of it acknowledging British sovereignty, without feeling that\r\nunion and not separation ought to be the foremost principle with\r\nBritish American statesmen? Who that examines the condition of the\r\nseveral provinces which constitute British America, can fail to feel\r\nthat with the people of Canada must mainly rest the noble task, at no\r\ndistant date, of consolidating these provinces, aye, and of redeeming\r\nto civilization and peopling with new life the vast territories to our\r\nnorth, now so unworthily held by the Hudson's Bay Company. Who cannot\r\nsee that Providence has entrusted to us the building up of a great\r\nnorthern people, fit to cope with our neighbours of the United States,\r\nand to advance step by step with them in the march of civilization?\r\nSir, it is my fervent aspiration and belief that some here to-night\r\nmay live to see the day when the British American flag shall proudly\r\nwave from Labrador to Vancouver Island and from our own Niagara to the\r\nshores of Hudson Bay. Look abroad over the world and tell me what\r\ncountry possesses the advantages, if she but uses them aright, for\r\nachieving such a future, as Canada enjoys--a fertile soil, a healthful\r\nclimate, a hardy and frugal people, with great mineral resources,\r\nnoble rivers, boundless forests. We have within our grasp all the\r\nelements of prosperity. We are free from the thousand time-honoured\r\nevils and abuses that afflict and retard the nations of the Old World.\r\nNot even our neighbours of the United States occupy an equal position\r\nof advantage, for we have not the canker-worm of domestic slavery to\r\nblight our tree of liberty. And greater than these, we are but\r\ncommencing our career as a people, our institutions have yet to be\r\nestablished. We are free to look abroad over the earth and study the\r\nlessons of wisdom taught by the history of older countries, and choose\r\nthose systems and those laws and customs that experience has shown\r\nbest for advancing the moral and material interests of the human\r\nfamily.\"[20]\r\n\r\nAs a member of the coalition of 1864, Brown had an opportunity to\r\npromote his long-cherished object of adding the North-West Territories\r\nto Canada. There had been some communication between the British and\r\nCanadian governments, and in November 1864, the latter government said\r\nthat Canada was anxious to secure the settlement of the West and the\r\nestablishment of local governments. As the Hudson's Bay Company worked\r\nunder an English charter, it was for that government to extinguish its\r\nrights and give Canada a clear title. Canada would then annex, govern\r\nand open up communication with the territory. When Brown accompanied\r\nMacdonald, Cartier and Galt to England in 1865, this matter was taken\r\nup, and an agreement was arrived at which was reported to the Canadian\r\nlegislature in the second session of 1865. The committee said that\r\ncalling to mind the vital importance to Canada of having that great\r\nand fertile country open to Canadian enterprise and the tide of\r\nemigration into it directed through Canadian channels, remembering the\r\ndanger of large grants of land passing into the hands of mere money\r\ncorporations, and the risk that the recent discoveries of gold on the\r\neastern slope of the Rocky Mountains might throw into the country\r\nlarge masses of settlers unaccustomed to British institutions, they\r\narrived at the conclusion that the quickest solution of the question\r\nwould be the best for Canada. They therefore proposed that the whole\r\nterritory east of the Rockies and north of the American or Canadian\r\nline should be made over to Canada, subject to the rights of the\r\nHudson's Bay Company; and that the compensation to be made by Canada\r\nto the company should be met by a loan guaranteed by the British\r\ngovernment. To this, the imperial government consented.\r\n\r\nThe subsequent history of the acquisition of the West need not be told\r\nhere. In this case, as in others, Brown was a pioneer in a work which\r\nothers finished. But his services were generously acknowledged by Sir\r\nJohn Macdonald, who said in the House of Commons in 1875: \"From the\r\nfirst time that he had entered parliament, the people of Canada looked\r\nforward to a western extension of territory, and from the time he was\r\nfirst a minister, in 1854, the question was brought up time and again,\r\nand pressed with great ability and force by the Hon. George Brown, who\r\nwas then a prominent man in opposition to the government.\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] Gunn and Tuttle's _History of Manitoba_, p. 303.\r\n\r\n[20] Toronto _Globe_, January 25th, 1858.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE RECIPROCITY TREATY OF 1874\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Brown's position in regard to reciprocity has already been\r\ndescribed. He set a high value upon the American market for Canadian\r\nproducts, and as early as 1863 he had urged the government of that day\r\nto prepare for the renewal of the treaty. He resigned from the\r\ncoalition ministry, because, to use his own words, \"I felt very\r\nstrongly that though we in Canada derived great advantage from the\r\ntreaty of 1854, the American people derived still greater advantage\r\nfrom it. I had no objection to that, and was quite ready to renew the\r\nold treaty, or even to extend it largely on fair terms of reciprocity.\r\nBut I was not willing to ask for a renewal as a favour to Canada; I\r\nwas not willing to offer special inducements for renewal without fair\r\nconcessions in return; I was not willing that the canals and inland\r\nwaters of Canada should be made the joint property of the United\r\nStates and Canada and be maintained at their joint expense; I was not\r\nwilling that the custom and excise duty of Canada should be\r\nassimilated to the prohibitory rates of the United States; and very\r\nespecially was I unwilling that any such arrangement should be entered\r\ninto with the United States, dependent on the frail tenure of\r\nreciprocal legislation, repealable at any moment at the caprice of\r\neither party.\" Unless a fair treaty for a definite term of years could\r\nbe obtained, he thought it better that each country should take its\r\nown course and that Canada should seek new channels of trade.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations of 1866 failed, mainly because under the American\r\noffer, \"the most important provisions of the expiring treaty, relating\r\nto the free interchange of the products of the two countries, were\r\nentirely set aside, and the duties proposed to be levied were almost\r\nprohibitory in their character.\" The free-list offered by the United\r\nStates reads like a diplomatic joke: \"burr-millstones, rags,\r\nfire-wood, grindstones, plaster and gypsum.\" The real bar in this and\r\nsubsequent negotiations, was the unwillingness of the Americans to\r\nenter into any kind of arrangement for extended trade. They did not\r\nwant to break in upon their system of protection, and they did not set\r\na high value on access to the Canadian market. In most of the\r\nnegotiations, the Americans are found trying to drive the best\r\npossible bargain in regard to the Canadian fisheries and canals, and\r\nfighting shy of reciprocity in trade. They considered that a free\r\nexchange of natural products would be far more beneficial to Canada\r\nthan to the United States. As time went on, they began to perceive the\r\nadvantages of the Canadian market for American manufactures. But when\r\nthis was apparent, Canadian feeling, which had hitherto been\r\nunanimous for reciprocity, began to show a cleavage, which was sharply\r\ndefined in the discussion preceding the election of 1891. Reciprocity\r\nin manufactures was opposed, because of the competition to which it\r\nwould expose Canadian industries, and because it was difficult to\r\narrange it without assimilating the duties of the two countries and\r\ndiscriminating against British imports into Canada.\r\n\r\nIn earlier years, however, even the inclusion of manufactures in the\r\ntreaty of reciprocity was an inducement by which the Americans set\r\nlittle store. The rejected offer made by Canada in 1869, about the\r\nexact terms of which doubt exists, included a list of manufactures. In\r\n1871 the American government declined to consider an offer to renew\r\nthe treaty of 1854 in return for access to the deep sea fisheries of\r\nCanada. The Brown Treaty of 1874, which contained a list of\r\nmanufactures, was rejected at Washington, while in Canada it was\r\ncriticized as striking a blow at the infant manufactures of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe Brown mission of 1874 was a direct result of the Treaty of\r\nWashington. Under that treaty there was to be an arbitration to\r\ndetermine the value of the American use of the Canadian inshore\r\nfisheries for twelve years, in excess of the value of the concessions\r\nmade by the United States. Before the fall of the Macdonald\r\ngovernment, Mr. Rothery, registrar of the High Court of Admiralty in\r\nEngland, arrived in Canada as the agent of the British government to\r\nprepare the Canadian case for arbitration. In passing through Toronto\r\nMr. Rothery spoke to several public men with a view to acquiring\r\ninformation as to the value of the fisheries. Mr. Brown availed\r\nhimself of that opportunity to suggest to him that a treaty of\r\nreciprocity in trade would be a far better compensation to Canada than\r\na cash payment. Mr. Rothery carried this proposal to Washington, where\r\nit was received with some favour.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Mackenzie government had been moving in the matter, and\r\nin February 1874, Mr. Brown was informed that there was a movement at\r\nWashington for the renewal of the old reciprocity treaty, and was\r\nasked to make an unofficial visit to that city and estimate the\r\nchances of success. On February 12th, he wrote: \"We know as yet of but\r\nfew men who are bitterly against us. I saw General Butler, at his\r\nrequest, on the subject, and I understand he will support us. Charles\r\nSumner is heart and hand with us, and is most kind to me personally.\"\r\nOn February 14th, he expressed his belief that if a bill for the\r\nrenewal of the reciprocity treaty could be submitted to congress at\r\nonce, it would be carried.\r\n\r\nA British commission was issued on March 17th, 1874, appointing Sir\r\nEdward Thornton, British minister at Washington, and Mr. Brown, as\r\njoint plenipotentiaries to negotiate a treaty of fisheries, commerce\r\nand navigation with the government of the United States. This mode of\r\nrepresentation was insisted upon by the Mackenzie government, in view\r\nof the unsatisfactory result of the negotiations of 1871, when Sir\r\nJohn A. Macdonald, as one commissioner out of six, made a gallant but\r\nunsuccessful fight for the rights of Canada. Mr. Brown was selected,\r\nnot only because of his knowledge of and interest in reciprocity, but\r\nbecause of his attitude during the war, which had made him many warm\r\nfriends among those who opposed slavery and stood for the union.\r\n\r\nNegotiations were formally opened on March 28th. The Canadians\r\nproposed the renewal of the old reciprocity treaty, and the\r\nabandonment of the fishery arbitration. The American secretary of\r\nstate, Mr. Fish, suggested the enlargement of the Canadian canals, and\r\nthe addition of manufactures to the free list. The Canadian\r\ncommissioners having agreed to consider these proposals, a project of\r\na treaty was prepared to form a basis of discussion. It provided for\r\nthe renewal of the old reciprocity treaty for twenty-one years, with\r\nthe addition of certain manufactures; the abandonment of the fishery\r\narbitration; complete reciprocity in coasting; the enlargement of the\r\nWelland and St. Lawrence canals; the opening of the Canadian, New\r\nYork, and Michigan canals to vessels of both countries; the free\r\nnavigation of Lake Michigan; the appointment of a joint commission for\r\nimproving waterways, protecting fisheries and erecting lighthouses on\r\nthe Great Lakes. Had the treaty been ratified, there would have been\r\nreciprocity in farm and other natural products, and in a very\r\nimportant list of manufactures, including agricultural implements,\r\naxles, iron, in the forms of bar, hoop, pig, puddled, rod, sheet or\r\nscrap; iron nails, spikes, bolts, tacks, brads and springs; iron\r\ncastings; locomotives and railroad cars and trucks; engines and\r\nmachinery for mills, factories and steamboats; fire-engines; wrought\r\nand cast steel; steel plates and rails; carriages, carts, wagons and\r\nsleighs; leather and its manufactures, boots, shoes, harness and\r\nsaddlery; cotton grain bags, denims, jeans, drillings, plaids and\r\nticking; woollen tweeds; cabinet ware and furniture, and machines made\r\nof wood; printing paper for newspapers, paper-making machines, type,\r\npresses, folders, paper cutters, ruling machines, stereotyping and\r\nelectrotyping apparatus. In general terms, it was as near to\r\nunrestricted reciprocity as was possible without raising the question\r\nof discriminating against the products of Great Britain.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown found that American misapprehensions as to Canada, its\r\nrevenue, commerce, shipping, railways and industries were \"truly\r\nmarvellous.\" It was generally believed that the trade of Canada was of\r\nlittle value to the United States; that the reciprocity treaty had\r\nenriched Canada at their expense; and that the abolition of the treaty\r\nhad brought Canada nearly to its wits' end. There was some excuse for\r\nthese misapprehensions. Until confederation, the trade returns from\r\nthe different provinces were published separately, if at all. No clear\r\nstatement of the combined traffic of the provinces with the United\r\nStates was published until 1874, and even Canadians were ignorant of\r\nits extent. American protectionists founded a \"balance of trade\"\r\nargument on insufficient data. They saw that old Canada sold large\r\nquantities of wheat and flour to the United States, but not that the\r\nUnited States sent larger quantities to the Maritime Provinces; that\r\nNova Scotia and Cape Breton sold coal to Boston and New York, but not\r\nthat five times as much was sent from Pennsylvania to Canada. Brown\r\nprepared a memorandum showing that the British North American\r\nprovinces, from 1820 to 1854, had bought one hundred and sixty-seven\r\nmillion dollars worth of goods from the United States, and the United\r\nStates only sixty-seven million dollars worth from the provinces; that\r\nin the thirteen years of the treaty, the trade between the two\r\ncountries was six hundred and thirty million dollars according to the\r\nCanadian returns, and six hundred and seventy million dollars\r\naccording to the American returns; and that the so-called \"balance of\r\ntrade\" in this period was considerably against Canada. It was shown\r\nthat the repeal of the treaty did not ruin Canadian commerce; that the\r\nexternal trade of Canada which averaged one hundred and fifteen\r\nmillion dollars a year from 1854 to 1862, rose to one hundred and\r\nforty-two million dollars in the year following the abrogation, and\r\nto two hundred and forty million dollars in 1873. In regard to wheat,\r\nflour, provisions, and other commodities of which both countries had a\r\nsurplus, the effect of the prohibitory American duties had been to\r\nsend the products of Canada to compete with those of the United States\r\nin neutral markets.\r\n\r\nThis memorandum was completed on April 27th and was immediately handed\r\nto Mr. Fish. It was referred to the treasury department, where it was\r\nclosely examined and admitted to be correct. From that time there was\r\na marked improvement in American feeling.\r\n\r\nBrown also carried on a vigorous propaganda in the newspapers. In\r\nNew York the _Tribune_, _Herald_, _Times_, _World_, _Evening\r\nPost_, _Express_, _Journal of Commerce_, _Graphic_, _Mail_,\r\nand other journals, declared in favour of a new treaty; and in Boston,\r\nChicago, St. Louis, Cincinnati and other large cities, the press was\r\nequally favourable. A charge originated in Philadelphia and was\r\ncirculated in the United States and Canada, that this unanimity of\r\nthe press was obtained by the corrupt use of public money. Mr. Brown,\r\nin his speech in the senate of Canada denied this; said that not a\r\nshilling had been spent illegitimately, and that the whole cost of the\r\nnegotiation to the people of Canada would be little more than four\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\nIn his correspondence Brown speaks of meeting Senator Conkling,\r\nGeneral Garfield and Carl Schurz, all of whom were favourable.\r\nSecretary Fish is described as courteous and painstaking, but timid\r\nand lacking in grasp of the subject, and Brown speaks impatiently of\r\nthe delays that are throwing the consideration of the draft treaty\r\nover to the end of the session of congress.\r\n\r\nIt did not reach the senate until two days before adjournment. \"The\r\npresident\" wrote Mr. Brown on June 20th, \"sent a message to the senate\r\nwith the treaty, urging a decision before the adjournment of congress.\r\nI thought the message very good; but it has the defect of not speaking\r\ndefinitely of this message as his own and his government's and calling\r\non the senate to sustain him. Had he done this, the treaty would have\r\nbeen through now. But now, with a majority in its favour, there seems\r\nsome considerable danger of its being thrown over until December.\" The\r\ntreaty was sent to the Foreign Relations Committee of the senate.\r\n\"There were six present; three said to be for us, one against, and two\r\nfor the measure personally, but wanted to hear from the country before\r\nacting. How it will end, no one can tell.\" As a matter of fact it\r\nended there and then, as far as the United States were concerned.\r\n\r\nOf the objections urged against the treaty in Canada, the most\r\nsignificant was that directed against the free list of manufactures.\r\nThis was, perhaps, the first evidence of the wave of protectionist\r\nsentiment that overwhelmed the Mackenzie government. In his speech in\r\nthe senate, in 1875, justifying the treaty, Mr. Brown said: \"Time was\r\nin Canada when the imposition of duty on any article was regarded as a\r\nmisfortune, and the slightest addition to an existing duty was\r\nresented by the people. But increasing debt brought new burdens; the\r\ndeceptive cry of 'incidental protection' got a footing in the land;\r\nand from that the step has been easy to the bold demand now set up by\r\na few favoured industries, that all the rest of the community ought to\r\nbe, and should rejoice to be, taxed seventeen and a half per cent, to\r\nkeep them in existence.\"\r\n\r\nBrown joined issue squarely with the protectionists. \"I contend that\r\nthere is not one article contained in the schedules that ought not to\r\nbe wholly free of duty, either in Canada or the United States, in the\r\ninterest of the public. I contend that the finance minister of Canada\r\nwho--treaty or no treaty with the United States--was able to announce\r\nthe repeal of all customs duties on the entire list of articles in\r\nSchedules A, B, and C,--even though the lost revenue was but shifted\r\nto articles of luxury, would carry with him the hearty gratitude of\r\nthe country. Nearly every article in the whole list of manufactures is\r\neither of daily consumption and necessity among all classes of our\r\npopulation, or an implement of trade, or enters largely into the\r\neconomical prosecution of the main industries of the Dominion.\" The\r\ncriticism of the sliding scale, of which so much was heard at the\r\ntime, was only another phase of the protectionist objection. The\r\ncharge that the treaty would discriminate in favour of American\r\nagainst British imports was easily disposed of. Brown showed that\r\nevery article admitted free from the United States would be admitted\r\nfree from Great Britain. But as this meant British as well as American\r\ncompetition, it made the case worse from the protectionist point of\r\nview. The rejection of the treaty by the United States left a clear\r\nfield for the protectionists in Canada.\r\n\r\nFour years after Mr. Brown's speech defending the treaty, he made his\r\nlast important speech in the senate, and almost the last public\r\nutterance of his life, attacking Tilley's protectionist budget, and\r\nnailing his free-trade colours to the mast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nCANADIAN NATIONALISM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that after the victory won by the Reformers in\r\n1848, there was an outbreak of radical sentiment, represented by the\r\nClear Grits in Upper Canada and by the Rouges in Lower Canada. It may\r\nbe more than a coincidence that there was a similar stirring of the\r\nblood in Ontario and in Quebec after the Liberal victory of 1874. The\r\nfounding of the _Liberal_ and of the _Nation_, of the National Club\r\nand of the Canada First Association, Mr. Blake's speech at Aurora, and\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith's utterances combined to mark this period as one of\r\nextraordinary intellectual activity. Orthodox Liberalism was\r\ndisquieted by these movements. It had won a great, and as was then\r\nbelieved, a permanent victory over Macdonald and all that he\r\nrepresented, and it had no sympathy with a disturbing force likely to\r\nbreak up party lines, and to lead young men into new and unknown\r\npaths.\r\n\r\nThe platform of Canada First was not in itself revolutionary. It\r\nembraced, (1) British connection; (2) closer trade relations with the\r\nBritish West India Islands, with a view to ultimate political\r\nconnection; (3) an income franchise; (4) the ballot, with the\r\naddition of compulsory voting; (5) a scheme for the representation of\r\nminorities; (6) encouragement of immigration and free homesteads in\r\nthe public domain; (7) the imposition of duties for revenue so\r\nadjusted as to afford every possible encouragement to native industry;\r\n(8) an improved militia system under command of trained Dominion\r\nofficers; (9) no property qualifications in members of the House of\r\nCommons; (10) reorganization of the senate; (11) pure and economic\r\nadministration of public affairs. This programme was severely\r\ncriticized by the _Globe_. Some of the articles, such as purity and\r\neconomy, were scornfully treated as commonplaces of politics. \"Yea,\r\nand who knoweth not such things as these.\" The framers of the platform\r\nwere rebuked for their presumption in setting themselves above the old\r\nparties, and were advised to \"tarry in Jericho until their beards be\r\ngrown.\"\r\n\r\nBut the letter of the programme did not evince the spirit of Canada\r\nFirst, which was more clearly set forth in the prospectus of the\r\n_Nation_. There it was said that the one thing needful was the\r\ncultivation of a national spirit. The country required the stimulus of\r\npatriotism. Old prejudices of English, Scottish, Irish and German\r\npeople were crystallized. Canadians must assert their nationality,\r\ntheir position as members of a nation. These and other declarations\r\nwere analyzed by the _Globe_, and the heralds of the new gospel were\r\npressed for a plainer avowal of their intentions. Throughout the\r\neditorial utterances of the _Globe_ there was shown a growing\r\nsuspicion that the ulterior aim of the Canada First movement was to\r\nbring about the independence of Canada. The quarrel came to a head\r\nwhen Mr. Goldwin Smith was elected president of the National Club. The\r\n_Globe_, in its issue of October 27th, 1874, brought its heaviest\r\nartillery to bear on the members of the Canada First party. It accused\r\nthem of lack of courage and frankness. When brought to book as to\r\ntheir principles, it said, they repudiated everything. They repudiated\r\nnativism; they repudiated independence; they abhorred the very idea of\r\nannexation. The movement was without meaning when judged by these\r\nrepudiations, but was very significant and involved grave practical\r\nissues when judged by the practices of its members. They had talked\r\nloudly and foolishly of emancipation from political thraldom, as if\r\nthe present connection of Canada with Great Britain were a yoke and a\r\nburden too heavy and too galling to be borne. They had adopted the\r\nplank of British connection by a majority of only four. They had\r\nchosen as their standard-bearer, their prophet and their president,\r\none whose chief claim to prominence lay in the persistency with which\r\nhe had advocated the breaking up of the British empire. Mr. Goldwin\r\nSmith had come into a peaceful community to do his best for the\r\nfurtherance of a cause which meant simply revolution. The advocacy of\r\nindependence, said the _Globe_, could not be treated as an academic\r\nquestion. It touched every Canadian in his dearest and most important\r\nrelations. It jeopardized his material, social and religious\r\ninterests. Canada was not a mere dead limb of the British tree, ready\r\nto fall of its own weight. The union was real, and the branch was a\r\nliving one. Great Britain, it was true, would not fight to hold Canada\r\nagainst her will, but if the great mass of Canadians believed in\r\nBritish connection, those who wished to break the bond must be ready\r\nto take their lives in their hands. The very proposal to cut loose\r\nfrom Britain would be only the beginning of trouble. In any case what\r\nwas sought was revolution, and those who preached it ought to\r\ncontemplate all the possibilities of such a course. They might be the\r\nfathers and founders of a new nationality, but they might also be\r\nsimply mischief-makers, whose insignificance and powerlessness were\r\ntheir sole protection, who were not important enough for \"either a\r\ntraitor's trial or a traitor's doom.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith's reply to this attack was that he was an advocate,\r\nnot of revolution but of evolution. \"Gradual emancipation,\" he said,\r\n\"means nothing more than the gradual concession by the mother country\r\nto the colonies of powers of self-government; this process has already\r\nbeen carried far. Should it be carried further and ultimately\r\nconsummated, as I frankly avow my belief it must, the mode of\r\nproceeding will be the same that it has always been. Each step will\r\nbe an Act of parliament passed with the assent of the Crown. As to the\r\nfilial tie between England and Canada, I hope it will endure forever.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Goldwin Smith's views were held by some other members of the\r\nCanada First party. Another and a larger section were Imperialists,\r\nwho believed that Canada should assert herself by demanding a larger\r\nshare of self-government within the empire, and by demanding the\r\nprivileges and responsibilities of citizens of the empire. The bond\r\nthat united the Imperialists and the advocates of independence was\r\nnational spirit. This was what the _Globe_ failed to perceive, or at\r\nleast to recognize fully. Its article of October 27th is powerful and\r\nlogical, strong in sarcasm and invective. It displays every purely\r\nintellectual quality necessary for the treatment of the subject, but\r\nlacks the insight that comes from imagination and sympathy. The\r\ndeclarations of those whose motto was \"Canada first,\" could fairly be\r\ncriticized as vague, but this vagueness was the result, not of\r\ncowardice or insincerity, but of the inherent difficulty of putting\r\nthe spirit of the movement into words. A youth whose heart is stirred\r\nby all the aspirations of coming manhood, \"yearning for the large\r\nexcitement that the coming years would yield,\" might have the same\r\nhesitation in writing down his yearnings and aspirations on a sheet of\r\npaper, and might be as unwisely snubbed by his elders.\r\n\r\nThe greatest intellect of the Liberal party felt the impulse. At\r\nAurora Edward Blake startled the more cautious members of the party by\r\nadvocating the federation of the empire, the reorganization of the\r\nsenate, compulsory voting, extension of the franchise and\r\nrepresentation of minorities. His real theme was national spirit.\r\nNational spirit would be lacking until we undertook national\r\nresponsibilities. He described the Canadian people as \"four millions\r\nof Britons who are not free.\" By the policy of England, in which we\r\nhad no voice or control, Canada might be plunged into the horrors of\r\nwar. Recently, without our consent, the navigation of the St. Lawrence\r\nhad been ceded forever to the United States. We could not complain of\r\nthese things unless we were prepared to assume the full\r\nresponsibilities of citizenship within the empire. The young men of\r\nCanada heard these words with a thrill of enthusiasm, but the note was\r\nnot struck again. The movement apparently ceased, and politics\r\napparently flowed back into their old channels. But while the name,\r\nthe organization and the organs of Canada First in the press\r\ndisappeared, the force and spirit remained, and exercised a powerful\r\ninfluence upon Canadian politics for many years.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the Liberal party was injured by the\r\nuncompromising hostility which was shown to the movement of 1874.\r\nYoung men, enthusiasts, bold and original thinkers, began to look\r\nupon Liberalism as a creed harsh, dry, tyrannical, unprogressive and\r\nhostile to new ideas. When the independent lodgment afforded by Canada\r\nFirst disappeared, many of them drifted over to the Conservative\r\nparty, whose leader was shrewd enough to perceive the strength of the\r\nspirit of nationalism, and to give it what countenance he could.\r\nProtection triumphed at the polls in 1878, not merely by the use of\r\neconomic arguments, but because it was heralded as the \"National\r\nPolicy\" and hailed as a declaration of the commercial independence of\r\nCanada. A few years later the legislation for the building of the\r\nCanadian Pacific Railway, bold to the point of rashness, as it seemed,\r\nand unwise and improvident in some of its provisions, was heartily\r\napproved by the country, because it was regarded as a measure of\r\nnational growth and expansion. The strength of the Conservative party\r\nfrom 1878 to 1891 was largely due to its adoption of the vital\r\nprinciple and spirit of Canada First.\r\n\r\nThe _Globe's_ attacks upon the Canada First party also had the effect\r\nof fixing in the public mind a picture of George Brown as a dictator\r\nand a relentless wielder of the party whip, a picture contrasting\r\nstrangely with those suggested by his early career. He had fought for\r\nresponsible government, for freedom from clerical dictation; he had\r\nbeen one of the boldest of rebels against party discipline; he had\r\ncarelessly thrown away a great party advantage in order to promote\r\nconfederation; he had been the steady opponent of slavery. In 1874\r\nthe Liberals were in power both at Ottawa and at Toronto, and Mr.\r\nBrown may not have been free from the party man's delusion that when\r\nhis party is in power all is well, and agitation for change is\r\nmischievous. Canada First threatened to change the formation of\r\npolitical parties, and seemed to him to threaten a change in the\r\nrelations of Canada to the empire. But these explanations do not alter\r\nthe fact that his attitude caused the Liberal party to lose touch with\r\na movement characterized by intellectual keenness and generosity of\r\nsentiment, representing a real though ill-defined national impulse,\r\nand destined to leave its mark upon the history of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nLATER YEARS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters it has been necessary to follow closely the\r\nnumerous public movements with which Brown was connected. Here we may\r\npause and consider some incidents of his life and some aspects of his\r\ncharacter which lie outside of these main streams of action. First, a\r\nfew words about the Brown household. Of the relations between father\r\nand son something has already been said. Of his mother, Mr. Alexander\r\nMackenzie says: \"We may assume that Mr. Brown derived much of his\r\nenergy, power and religious zeal from his half Celtic origin: these\r\nqualities he possessed in an eminent degree, united with the\r\nproverbial caution and prudence of the Lowlander.\" The children, in\r\nthe order of age, were Jane, married to Mr. George Mackenzie of New\r\nYork; George; Isabella, married to Mr. Thomas Henning; Katherine, who\r\ndied unmarried; Marianne, married to the Rev. W. S. Ball; and John\r\nGordon. There were no idlers in that family. The publication of the\r\n_Globe_ in the early days involved a tremendous struggle. Peter Brown\r\nlent a hand in the business as well as in the editorial department of\r\nthe paper. A good deal of the writing in the _Banner_ and the early\r\n_Globe_ seems to bear the marks of his broad Liberalism and his\r\npassionate love of freedom. Gordon entered the office as a boy, and\r\nrose to be managing editor. Three of the daughters conducted a ladies'\r\nschool, which enjoyed an excellent reputation for thoroughness.\r\nKatherine, the third daughter, was killed in a railway accident at\r\nSyracuse; and the shock seriously affected the health of the father,\r\nwho died in 1863. The mother had died in the previous year.\r\n\r\nBy these events and by marriages the busy household was broken up.\r\nGeorge Brown, as we have seen, married in 1862, and from that time\r\nuntil his death his letters to his wife and children show an intense\r\naffection and love of home. After her husband's death Mrs. Brown\r\nresided in Edinburgh, where she died on May 6th 1906. The only son,\r\nGeorge M. Brown, was, in the last parliament, member of the British\r\nHouse of Commons for Centre Edinburgh, and is one of the firm of\r\nThomas Nelson & Sons, publishers. In the same city reside two\r\ndaughters, Margaret, married to Dr. A. F. H. Barbour, a well-known\r\nphysician, and writer on medicine; and Edith, wife of George Sandeman.\r\nAmong other survivors are, E. B. Brown, barrister, Toronto; Alfred S.\r\nBall, K.C., police magistrate, Woodstock; and Peter B. Ball,\r\ncommercial agent for Canada at Birmingham, nephews of George Brown.\r\n\r\nFrom 1852 George Brown was busily engaged in public life, and a large\r\npart of the work of the newspaper must have fallen on other shoulders.\r\nThere are articles in which one may fancy he detects the French\r\nneatness of William Macdougall. George Sheppard spoke at the\r\nconvention of 1859 like a statesman; and he and Macdougall had higher\r\nqualities than mere facility with the pen. Gordon Brown gradually grew\r\ninto the editorship. \"He had\" says Mr. E. W. Thomson, writing of a\r\nlater period, \"a singular power of utilizing suggestions, combining\r\nseveral that were evidently not associated, and indicating how they\r\ncould be merged in a striking manner. He seems to me now to have been\r\nthe greatest all-round editor I have yet had the pleasure of\r\nwitnessing at work, and in the political department superior to any of\r\nthe old or of the new time in North America, except only Horace\r\nGreeley.\" But Mr. Thomson thinks that like most of the old-timers he\r\ntook his politics a little too hard. Mr. Gordon Brown died in June,\r\n1896.\r\n\r\nMr. Brown regarded his defeat in South Ontario in 1867, as an\r\nopportunity to retire from parliamentary life. He had expressed that\r\nintention several months before. He wrote to Holton, on May 13th,\r\n1867, \"My fixed determination is to see the Liberal party re-united\r\nand in the ascendant, and then make my bow as a politician. As a\r\njournalist and a citizen, I hope always to be found on the right side\r\nand heartily supporting my old friends. But I want to be free to write\r\nof men and things without control, beyond that which my conscientious\r\nconvictions and the interests of my country demand. To be debarred by\r\nfear of injuring the party from saying that--is unfit to sit in\r\nparliament and that--is very stupid, makes journalism a very small\r\nbusiness. Party leadership and the conducting of a great journal do\r\nnot harmonize.\"\r\n\r\nIn his speech at the convention of 1867 he said that he had looked\r\nforward to the triumph of representation by population as the day of\r\nhis emancipation from parliamentary life, but that the case was\r\naltered by the proposal to continue the coalition, involving a\r\nsecession from the ranks of the Liberal party. In this juncture it was\r\nnecessary for Liberals to unite and consult, and if it were found that\r\nhis continuance in parliamentary life for a short time would be a\r\nservice to the party, he would not refuse. It would be impossible,\r\nhowever, for him to accept any official position, and he did not wish,\r\nby remaining in parliament, to stand in the way of those who would\r\notherwise become leaders of the party. He again emphasized the\r\ndifficulty of combining the functions of leadership of a party and\r\nmanagement of a newspaper. \"The sentiments of the leader of a party\r\nare only known from his public utterances on public occasions. If a\r\nwrong act is committed by an opponent or by a friend, he may simply\r\nshrug his shoulders.\" But it was otherwise with the journalist. He had\r\nbeen accused of fierce assaults on public men. \"But I tell you if the\r\ndaily thoughts and the words daily uttered by other public men were\r\nwritten in a book as mine have been, and circulated all over the\r\ncountry, there would have been a very different comparison between\r\nthem and myself. I have had a double duty to perform. If I had been\r\nsimply the leader of a party and had not controlled a public journal,\r\nsuch things would not have been left on record. I might have passed my\r\nobservations in private conversation, and no more would have been\r\nheard of them. But as a journalist it was necessary I should speak the\r\ntruth before the people, no matter whether it helped my party or not;\r\nand this, of course, reflected on the position of the party.\r\nConsequently, I have long felt very strongly that I had to choose one\r\nposition or the other--that of a leader in parliamentary life, or that\r\nof a monitor in the public press--and the latter has been my choice\r\nbeing probably more in consonance with my ardent temperament, and at\r\nthe same time, in my opinion, more influential; for I am free to say\r\nthat in view of all the grand offices that are now talked\r\nof--governorships, premierships and the like--I would rather be editor\r\nof the _Globe_, with the hearty confidence of the great mass of the\r\npeople of Upper Canada, than have the choice of them all.\"\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Brown's relations with the parliamentary leaders after his\r\nretirement, Mr. Mackenzie says: \"Nor did he ever in after years\r\nattempt to control or influence parliamentary proceedings as conducted\r\nby the Liberals in opposition, or in the government; while always\r\nwilling to give his opinion when asked on any particular question, he\r\nnever volunteered his advice. His opinions, of course, received free\r\nutterance in the _Globe_, which was more unfettered by reason of his\r\nabsence from parliamentary duties; though even there it was rarely\r\nindeed that any articles were published which were calculated to\r\ninconvenience or discomfort those who occupied his former\r\nposition.\"[21]\r\n\r\nLeft comparatively free to follow his own inclinations, Brown plunged\r\ninto farming, spending money and energy freely in the raising of fine\r\ncattle on his Bow Park estate near Brantford, an extensive business\r\nwhich ultimately led to the formation of a joint stock company. The\r\nprovince of Ontario, especially western Ontario, was for him the\r\nobject of an intense local patriotism. He loved to travel over it and\r\nto meet the people. It was noticed in the _Globe_ office that he paid\r\nspecial attention to the weekly edition of the paper, as that which\r\nreached the farming community. His Bow Park enterprise gave him an\r\nincreased feeling of kinship and sympathy with that community, and he\r\ndelighted in showing farmers over the estate. It would be hard to draw\r\na more characteristic picture than that of the tall senator striding\r\nover the fields, talking of cattle and crops with all the energy with\r\nwhich he was wont to denounce the Tories.\r\n\r\nBrown was appointed to the senate in December, 1873. Except for the\r\nspeech on reciprocity, which is dealt with elsewhere, his career there\r\nwas not noteworthy. He seems to have taken no part in the discussion\r\non Senator Vidal's resolution in favour of prohibition, or on the\r\nScott Act, a measure for introducing prohibition by local option. A\r\npopular conception of Brown as an ardent advocate of legislative\r\nprohibition may have been derived from some speeches made in his early\r\ncareer, and from an early prospectus of the _Globe_. On the bill\r\nproviding for government of the North-West Territories he made a\r\nspeech against the provision for separate schools, warning the House\r\nthat the effect would be to fasten these institutions on the West in\r\nperpetuity.\r\n\r\nIn 1876 Senator Brown figured in a remarkable case of contempt of\r\ncourt. A Bowmanville newspaper had charged Senator Simpson, a\r\npolitical ally of Brown, with resorting to bribery in the general\r\nelection of 1872. It published also a letter from Senator Brown to\r\nSenator Simpson, asking him for a subscription towards the Liberal\r\ncampaign fund. On Senator Simpson's application, Wilkinson, the editor\r\nof the paper, was called upon to show cause why a criminal information\r\nshould not issue against him for libel. The case was argued before the\r\nQueen's Bench, composed of Chief-Justice Harrison, Justice Morrison,\r\nand Justice Wilson. The judgment of the court delivered by the\r\nchief-justice was against the editor in regard to two of the articles\r\ncomplained of and in his favour in regard to the third. In following\r\nthe chief-justice, Mr. Justice Wilson took occasion to refer to\r\nSenator Brown's letter and to say that it was written with corrupt\r\nintent to interfere with the freedom of elections.\r\n\r\nBrown was not the man to allow a charge of this kind to go unanswered,\r\nand in this case there were special circumstances calculated to arouse\r\nhis anger. The publication of his letter in the Bowmanville paper had\r\nbeen the signal for a fierce attack upon him by the Conservative press\r\nof the province. It appeared to him that Justice Wilson had wantonly\r\nmade himself a participant in this attack, lending the weight of his\r\njudicial influence to his enemies. Interest was added to the case by\r\nthe fact that the judge had been in previous years supported by the\r\n_Globe_ in municipal and parliamentary elections. He had been\r\nsolicitor-general in the Macdonald-Sicotte government from May 1862 to\r\nMay 1863. Judge Morrison had been solicitor-general under Hincks, and\r\nafterwards a colleague of John A. Macdonald. Each of them, in this\r\ncase, took a course opposite to that which might have been expected\r\nfrom old political associations.\r\n\r\nA few days afterwards the _Globe_ contained a long, carefully prepared\r\nand powerful attack upon Mr. Justice Wilson. Beginning with a tribute\r\nto the Bench of Ontario, it declared that no fault was to be found\r\nwith the judgment of the court, and that the offence lay in the\r\ngratuitous comments of Mr. Justice Wilson.\r\n\r\n\"No sooner had the chief-justice finished than Mr. Justice Wilson\r\navailed himself of the occasion to express his views of the matter\r\nwith a freedom of speech and an indifference to the evidence before\r\nthe court and an indulgence in assumptions, surmises and insinuations,\r\nthat we believe to be totally unparalleled in the judicial proceedings\r\nof any Canadian court.\"\r\n\r\nThe article denied that the letter was written with any corrupt\r\nintent, and it stated that the entire fund raised by the Liberal party\r\nin the general election of 1872 was only three thousand seven hundred\r\ndollars, or forty-five dollars for each of the eighty-two\r\nconstituencies. \"This Mr. Justice Wilson may rest assured of: that\r\nsuch slanders and insults shall not go unanswered, and if the dignity\r\nof the Bench is ruffled in the tussle, on his folly shall rest the\r\nblame. We cast back on Mr. Wilson his insolent and slanderous\r\ninterpretation. The letter was not written for corrupt purposes. It\r\nwas not written to interfere with the freedom of elections. It was not\r\nan invitation to anybody to concur in committing bribery and\r\ncorruption at the polls; and be he judge or not who says so, this\r\nstatement is false.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer went on to contend that there were perfectly legitimate\r\nexpenditures in keenly contested elections. \"Was there no such fund\r\nwhen Mr. Justice Wilson was in public life? When the hat went round in\r\nhis contest for the mayoralty, was that or was it not a concurrence in\r\nbribery or corruption at the polls?\" Mr. Justice Wilson had justified\r\nhis comment by declaring that he might take notice of matters with\r\nwhich every person of ordinary intelligence was acquainted. Fastening\r\nupon these words the _Globe_ asked, \"How could Mr. Justice Wilson in\r\nhis hunt for things which every person of ordinary intelligence is\r\nacquainted with, omit to state that while the entire general election\r\nfund of the Liberal party for that year (1872) was but three thousand\r\nseven hundred dollars, raised by subscription from a few private\r\nindividuals, the Conservative fund on the same occasion amounted to\r\nthe enormous sum of two hundred thousand dollars, raised by the\r\nflagitious sale of the Pacific Railway contract to a band of\r\nspeculators on terms disastrous to the interests of the country.\"\r\n\r\nIn another vigorous paragraph the writer said: \"We deeply regret being\r\ncompelled to write of the conduct of any member of the Ontario Bench\r\nin the tone of this article, but the offence was so rank, so reckless,\r\nso utterly unjustifiable that soft words would have but poorly\r\ndischarged our duty to the public.\"\r\n\r\nNo proceedings were taken in regard to this article until about five\r\nmonths afterwards, when Mr. Wilkinson, the editor of the Bowmanville\r\npaper, applied to have Mr. Brown committed for contempt of court. The\r\njudge assailed took no action and the case was tried before his\r\ncolleagues, Chief-Justice Harrison and Judge Morrison. Mr. Brown\r\nappeared in person and made an argument occupying portions of two\r\ndays. He pointed out that the application had been delayed five\r\nmonths after the publication of the article. He contended that\r\nWilkinson was not prejudiced by the _Globe_ article and had no\r\nstanding in the case. In a lengthy affidavit he entered into the whole\r\nquestion of the expenditure of the two parties in the election of\r\n1872, including the circumstances of the Pacific Scandal. He repeated\r\non oath the statement made in the article that his letter was not\r\nwritten with corrupt intent; that the subscription asked for was for\r\nlegitimate purposes and that it was part of a fund amounting to only\r\nthree thousand seven hundred dollars for the whole province of\r\nOntario. He boldly justified the article as provoked by Mr. Justice\r\nWilson's dictum and by the use that would be made of it by hostile\r\npoliticians. The judge had chosen to intervene in a keen political\r\ncontroversy whose range extended to the Pacific Scandal; and in\r\ndefending himself from his enemies and the enemies of his party, Brown\r\nwas forced to answer the judge. He argued that to compel an editor to\r\nkeep silence in such a case, would not only be unjust to him, but\r\ncontrary to public policy. For instance, the discussion of a great\r\npublic question such as that involved in the Pacific Scandal, might be\r\nstopped upon the application of a party to a suit in which that\r\nquestion was incidentally raised.\r\n\r\nThe case was presented with his accustomed energy and thoroughness,\r\nfrom the point of view of journalistic duty, of politics and of\r\nlaw--for Mr. Brown was not afraid to tread that sacred ground and\r\ngive extensive citations from the law reports. His address may be\r\ncommended to any editor who may be pursued by that mysterious legal\r\nphantom, a charge of contempt of court. The energy of his gestures,\r\nthe shaking of the white head and the swinging of the long arms, must\r\nhave somewhat startled Osgoode Hall. The court was divided, the\r\nchief-justice ruling that there had been contempt, Mr. Justice\r\nMorrison, contra, and Mr. Justice Wilson taking no part in the\r\nproceedings. So the matter dropped, though not out of the memory of\r\neditors and politicians.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[21] Mackenzie's _Life and Speeches of the Hon. George Brown_, p. 119.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe building in which the life of the Hon. George Brown was so\r\ntragically ended, was one that had been presented to him by the\r\nReformers of Upper Canada before confederation \"as a mark of the high\r\nsense entertained by his political friends of the long, faithful and\r\nimportant services which he has rendered to the people of Canada.\" It\r\nstood upon the north side of King Street, on ground which is now the\r\nlower end of Victoria Street, for the purpose of extending which, the\r\nbuilding was demolished. The ground floor was occupied by the business\r\noffice; on the next, looking out upon King Street, was Mr. Brown's\r\nprivate office; and above that the rooms occupied by the editorial\r\nstaff, with the composing room in the rear. At about half past four\r\no'clock on the afternoon of March 25th, 1880, several of the occupants\r\nof the editorial rooms heard a shot, followed by a sound of breaking\r\nglass, and cries of \"Help!\" and \"Murder!\" Among these were Mr. Avern\r\nPardoe, now librarian of the legislative assembly of Ontario; Mr.\r\nArchibald Blue, now head of the census bureau at Ottawa; Mr. John A.\r\nEwan, now leader writer on the _Globe_; and Mr. Allan S. Thompson,\r\nfather of the present foreman of the _Globe_ composing room. Mr. Ewan\r\nand Mr. Thompson were first to arrive on the scene. Following the\r\ndirection from which the sounds proceeded, they found Mr. Brown on the\r\nlanding, struggling with an undersized man, whose head was thrust into\r\nBrown's breast. Mr. Ewan and Mr. Thompson seized the man, while Mr.\r\nBrown himself wrested a smoking pistol from his hand. Mr. Blue, Mr.\r\nPardoe and others quickly joined the group, and Mr. Brown, though not\r\napparently severely injured, was induced to lie on the sofa in his\r\nroom, where his wound was examined. The bullet had passed through the\r\nouter side of the left thigh, about four inches downward and backward;\r\nit was found on the floor of the office.\r\n\r\nThe assailant was George Bennett, who had been employed in the engine\r\nroom of the _Globe_ for some years, and had been discharged for\r\nintemperance. Mr. Brown said that when Bennett entered the office he\r\nproceeded to shut the door behind him. Thinking the man's movements\r\nsingular, Mr. Brown stopped him and asked him what he wanted. Bennett,\r\nafter some hesitation, presented a paper for Mr. Brown's signature,\r\nsaying that it was a statement that he had been employed in the\r\n_Globe_ for five years. Mr. Brown said he should apply to the head of\r\nthe department in which he was employed. Bennett said that the head of\r\nthe department had refused to give the certificate. Mr. Brown then\r\ntold him to apply to Mr. Henning, the treasurer of the company, who\r\ncould furnish the information by examining his books.\r\n\r\nBennett kept insisting that Mr. Brown should sign the paper, and\r\nfinally began to fumble in his pistol pocket, whereupon it passed\r\nthrough Mr. Brown's mind \"that the little wretch might be meaning to\r\nshoot me.\" As he got the pistol out, Mr. Brown seized his wrist and\r\nturned his hand downward. After one shot had been fired, the struggle\r\ncontinued until the two got outside the landing, where they were found\r\nas already described.\r\n\r\nThe bullet had struck no vital part, and the wound was not considered\r\nto be mortal. But as week after week passed without substantial\r\nimprovement, the anxiety of his friends and of the country deepened.\r\nAt the trial the question was raised whether recovery had been\r\nprevented by the fact that Mr. Brown, against the advice of his\r\nphysician, transacted business in his room. After the first eight or\r\nten days there were intervals of delirium. Towards the end of April\r\nwhen the case looked very serious, Mr. Brown had a long conversation\r\nwith the Rev. Dr. Greig, his old pastor, and with members of his\r\nfamily. \"In that conversation,\" says Mr. Mackenzie, \"he spoke freely\r\nto them of his faith and hope, and we are told poured out his soul in\r\nfull and fervent prayer,\" and he joined heartily in the singing of the\r\nhymn \"Rock of Ages.\" A few days afterwards he became unconscious; the\r\nphysicians ceased to press stimulants or nourishment upon him, and\r\nearly on Sunday, May 10th, he passed away.\r\n\r\nBennett was tried and found guilty of murder on June 22nd following,\r\nand was executed a month afterwards. Though he caused the death of a\r\nman so conspicuous in the public life of Canada, his act is not to be\r\nclassed with assassinations committed from political motives, or even\r\nfrom love of notoriety. On the scaffold he said that he had not\r\nintended to kill Mr. Brown. However this may be, it is certain that it\r\nwas not any act of Mr. Brown's that set up that process of brooding\r\nover grievances that had so tragic an ending. By misfortune and by\r\ndrinking, a mind, naturally ill-regulated had been reduced to that\r\ncondition in which enemies are seen on every hand. A paper was found\r\nupon him in which he set forth a maniacal plan of murdering a supposed\r\nenemy and concealing the remains in the furnace of the _Globe_\r\nbuilding. That the original object of his enmity was not Mr. Brown is\r\ncertain; there was not the slightest ground for the suspicion that the\r\nvictim was made to suffer for some enmity aroused in his strenuous\r\ncareer as a public man. Strange that after such a career he should\r\nmeet a violent death at the hands of a man who was thinking solely of\r\nprivate grievances!\r\n\r\nTracing Mr. Brown's career through a long period of history, by his\r\npublic actions, his speeches, and the volumes of his newspaper, one\r\narrives at a somewhat different estimate from that preserved in\r\nfamiliar gossip and tradition. That tradition pictures a man\r\nimpulsive, stormy, imperious, bearing down by sheer force all\r\nopposition to his will. In the main it is probably true; but the\r\nprinted record is also true, and out of the two we must strive to\r\nreproduce the man. We are told of a speech delivered with flashing\r\neye, with gestures that seemed almost to threaten physical violence.\r\nWe read the report of the speech and we find something more than the\r\nordinary transition from warm humanity, to cold print. There is not\r\nonly freedom from violence, but there is coherence, close reasoning, a\r\nsystematic marshalling of facts and figures and arguments. One might\r\nsay of many of his speeches, as was said of Alexander Mackenzie's\r\nsentences, that he built them as he built a stone wall. His tremendous\r\nenergy was not spasmodic, but was backed by solid industry, method and\r\npersistence.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Bengough said in a little poem published soon after Mr. Brown's\r\ndeath,\r\n\r\n    \"His nature was a rushing mountain stream;\r\n    His faults but eddies which its swiftness bred.\"\r\n\r\nIn his business as a journalist, he had not much of that philosophy\r\nwhich says that the daily difficulties of a newspaper are sure to\r\nsolve themselves by the effluxion of time. There are traditions of his\r\nimpatience and his outbreaks of wrath when something went wrong, but\r\nthere are traditions also of a kindness large enough to include the\r\nlad who carried the proofs to his house. Those who were thoroughly\r\nacquainted with the affairs of the office say that he was extremely\r\nlenient with employees who were intemperate or otherwise incurred\r\nblame, and that his leniency had been extended to Bennett. Intimate\r\nfriends and political associates deny that he played the dictator, and\r\nsay that he was genial and humorous in familiar intercourse. But it\r\nis, after all, a somewhat unprofitable task to endeavour to sit in\r\njudgment on the personal character of a public man, placing this\r\nvirtue against that fault, and solemnly assuming to decide which side\r\nof the ledger exceeds the other. We have to deal with the character of\r\nBrown as a force in its relation to other forces, and to the events of\r\nthe period of history covered by his career.\r\n\r\nA quarter of a century has now elapsed since the death of George Brown\r\nand a still longer time since the most stirring scenes in his career\r\nwere enacted. We ought therefore to be able to see him in something\r\nlike his true relation to the history of his times. He came to Canada\r\nat a time when the notion of colonial self-government was regarded as\r\na startling innovation. He found among the dominant class a curious\r\nrevival of the famous Stuart doctrine, \"No Bishop, no King;\" hence the\r\nrise of such leaders, partly political and partly religious, as Bishop\r\nStrachan, among the Anglicans, and Dr. Ryerson, among the Methodists,\r\nthe former vindicating and the latter challenging the exclusive\r\nprivileges of the Anglican Church. There was room for a similar\r\nleader among Presbyterians, and in a certain sense this was the\r\nopportunity of George Brown. In founding first a Presbyterian paper\r\nand afterwards a political paper, he was following a line familiar to\r\nthe people of his time. But while he had a special influence among\r\nPresbyterians, he appeared, not as claiming special privileges for\r\nthem, but as the opponent of all privilege, fighting first the\r\nAnglican Church and afterwards the Roman Catholic Church, and\r\nasserting in each case the principle of the separation of Church and\r\nState.\r\n\r\nFor some years after Brown's arrival in Canada, those questions in\r\nwhich politics and religion were blended were subordinated to a\r\nquestion purely political--colonial self-government. The atmosphere\r\nwas not favourable to cool discussion. The colony had been in\r\nrebellion, and the passions aroused by the rebellion were always ready\r\nto burst into flame. French Canada having been more deeply stirred by\r\nthe rebellion than Upper Canada, racial animosity was added there to\r\nparty bitterness. The task of the Reformers was to work steadily for\r\nthe establishment of a new order involving a highly important\r\nprinciple of government, and, at the same time, to keep the movement\r\nfree from all suspicion of incitement to rebellion.\r\n\r\nThe leading figure of this movement is that of Robert Baldwin, and he\r\nwas well supported by Hincks, by Sullivan, by William Hume Blake and\r\nothers. The forces were wisely led, and it is not pretended that this\r\ndirection was due to Brown. He was in 1844 only twenty-six years of\r\nage, and his position at first was that of a recruit. But he was a\r\nrecruit of uncommon vigour and steadiness, and though he did not\r\noriginate, he emphasized the idea of carrying on the fight on strictly\r\nconstitutional and peaceful lines. His experience in New York and his\r\ndeep hatred of slavery had strengthened by contrast his conviction\r\nthat Great Britain was the citadel of liberty, and hence his\r\nutterances in favour of British connection were not conventional, but\r\nglowed with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nWith 1849 came the triumph of Reform, and the last despairing effort\r\nof the old régime, dying out with the flames of the parliament\r\nbuildings at Montreal. Now ensued a change in both parties. The one,\r\nexhausted and discredited by its fight against the inevitable coming\r\nof the new order, remained for a time weak and inactive, under a\r\nleader whose day was done. The other, in the very hour of victory,\r\nbegan to suffer disintegration. It had its Conservative element\r\ndesiring to rest and be thankful, and its Radical element with aims\r\nnot unlike those of Chartism in England. Brown stood for a time\r\nbetween the government and the Conservative element on the one side\r\nand the Clear Grits on the other. Disintegration was hastened by the\r\nretirement of Baldwin and Lafontaine. Then came the brief and troubled\r\nreign of Hincks; then a reconstruction of parties, with Conservatives\r\nunder the leadership of Macdonald and Reformers under that of Brown.\r\n\r\nThe stream of politics between 1854 and 1864 is turbid; there is\r\npettiness, there is bitterness, there is confusion. But away from this\r\nturmoil the province is growing in population, in wealth, in all the\r\nelements of civilization. Upper Canada especially is growing by\r\nimmigration; it overtakes and passes Lower Canada in population, and\r\nthus arises the question of representation by population. Brown takes\r\nup this reform in representation as a means of freeing Upper Canada\r\nfrom the domination of the Lower Province. He becomes the \"favourite\r\nson\" of Upper Canada. His rival, through his French-Canadian alliance,\r\nmeets him with a majority from Lower Canada; and so, for several\r\nyears, there is a period of equally balanced parties and weak\r\ngovernments, ending in dead-lock.\r\n\r\nIf Brown's action had only broken this dead-lock, extricated some\r\nstruggling politicians from difficulty, and allowed the ordinary\r\nbusiness of government to proceed, it might have deserved only passing\r\nnotice. But more than that was involved. The difficulty was inherent\r\nin the system. The legislative union was Lord Durham's plan of\r\nassimilating the races that he had found \"warring in the bosom of a\r\nsingle state.\" The plan had failed. The line of cleavage was as\r\nsharply defined as ever. The ill-assorted union had produced only\r\nstrife and misunderstanding. Yet to break the tie when new duties and\r\nnew dangers had emphasized the necessity for union seemed to be an act\r\nof folly. To federalize the union was to combine the advantage of\r\ncommon action with liberty to each community to work out its own\r\nideals in education, municipal government and all other matters of\r\nlocal concern. More than that, to federalize the union was to\r\nsubstitute for a rigid bond a bond elastic enough to allow of\r\nexpansion, eastward to the Atlantic and westward to the Pacific. That\r\nprinciple which has been called provincial rights, or provincial\r\nautonomy, might be described more accurately and comprehensively as\r\nfederalism; and it is the basic principle of Canadian political\r\ninstitutions, as essential to unity as to peace and local freedom.\r\n\r\nThe feeble, isolated and distracted colonies of 1864 have given place\r\nto a commonwealth which, if not in strictness a nation, possesses all\r\nthe elements and possibilities of nationality, with a territory open\r\non three sides to the ocean, lying in the highway of the world's\r\ncommerce, and capable of supporting a population as large as that of\r\nthe British Islands. Confederation was the first and greatest step in\r\nthat process of expansion, and it is speaking only words of truth and\r\nsoberness to say that confederation will rank among the landmarks of\r\nthe world's history, and that its importance will not decline but will\r\nincrease as history throws events into their true perspective. It is\r\nin his association with confederation, with the events that led up to\r\nconfederation, and with the addition to Canada of the vast and fertile\r\nplains of the West, that the life of George Brown is of interest to\r\nthe student of history.\r\n\r\nBrown was not only a member of parliament and an actor in the\r\npolitical drama, but was the founder of a newspaper, and for\r\nthirty-six years the source of its inspiration and influence. As a\r\njournalist he touched life at many points. He was a man of varied\r\ninterests--railways, municipal affairs, prison reform, education,\r\nagriculture, all came within the range of his duty as a journalist and\r\nhis interest and sympathy as a man. Those stout-hearted men who amid\r\nall the wrangling and intrigue of the politicians were turning the\r\nwilderness of Canada into a garden, gave to Brown in large measure\r\ntheir confidence and affection. He, on his part, valued their\r\nfriendship more than any victory that could be won in the political\r\ngame. That was the standard by which he always asked to be judged.\r\nThis story of his life may help to show that he was true to the trust\r\nthey reposed in him, and to the principles that were the standards of\r\nhis political conduct, to government by the people, to free\r\ninstitutions, to religious liberty and equality, to the unity and\r\nprogress of the confederation of which he was one of the builders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nA\r\n\r\n_Albion_, the, Peter Brown contributes thereto, 2\r\n\r\nAnglican Church, exclusive claims of, 11, 51, 52\r\n\r\nAnnexation manifesto, result of discontent aroused by Rebellion Losses\r\n  Bill, and repeal of preferential trade, 37\r\n\r\n\r\nB\r\n\r\nBagot, Sir Charles, Governor of Canada,\r\n  friendly attitude towards French-Canadians, 16;\r\n  accepts Lafontaine and Baldwin as his advisers, 16;\r\n  accused of surrender to rebels, 16;\r\n  his action threatens to cause ministerial crisis in England, 16;\r\n  denounced by Duke of Wellington, 16, 17;\r\n  recalled at his own request, 18;\r\n  illness and death, 18;\r\n  begs his ministers to defend his memory, 18\r\n\r\nBaldwin, Robert,\r\n  father of responsible government, 21;\r\n  criticized by Dr. Ryerson, 22, 23;\r\n  his wise leadership, 24;\r\n  victory at polls, 33;\r\n  achievements of his ministry, 33;\r\n  the Rebellion Losses Bill, 34-7;\r\n  discontent of Clear Grits, 39;\r\n  the Baldwin-Lafontaine government defended by Brown, 42;\r\n  resigns because of vote of abolition of Court of Chancery, 47\r\n\r\n_Banner_, the,\r\n  established by the Browns, 5;\r\n  descriptive extracts, 3, 6-8\r\n\r\nBelleau, Sir Narcisse F.,\r\n  succeeds Sir É.
