INTRODUCTORY.\r\n\r\nWilliam the Second, German Emperor and King of Prussia, Burgrave of\r\nNürnberg, Margrave of Brandenburg, Landgrave of Hessen and Thuringia,\r\nPrince of Orange, Knight of the Garter and Field-Marshal of Great\r\nBritain, etc., was born in Berlin on January 27, 1859, and ascended\r\nthe throne on June 15, 1888. He is, therefore, fifty-four years old\r\nin the present year of his Jubilee, 1913, and his reign--happily yet\r\nunfinished--has extended over a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman who would understand the Emperor and his time must\r\nimagine a country with a monarchy, a government, and a people--in\r\nshort, a political system--almost entirely different from his own. In\r\nGermany, paradoxical though it may sound to English ears, there\r\nis neither a government nor a people. The word \"government\" occurs\r\nonly once in the Imperial Constitution, the Magna Charta of modern\r\nGermans, which in 1870 settled the relations between the Emperor and\r\nwhat the Englishman calls the \"people,\" and then only in an\r\nunimportant context joined to the word \"federal.\"\r\n\r\nIn Germany, instead of \"the people\" the Englishman speaks of when he\r\ntalks politics, and the democratic orator, Mr. Bryan, in America is\r\nfond of calling the \"peopul,\" there is a \"folk,\" who neither claim\r\nto be, nor apparently wish to be, a \"people\" in the English sense.\r\nThe German folk have their traditions as the English people have\r\ntraditions, and their place in the political system as the English\r\npeople have; but both traditions and place are wholly different from\r\nthose of the English people; indeed, it may be said are just the\r\nreverse of them.\r\n\r\nThe German Emperor believes, and assumes his people to believe, that\r\nthe Hollenzollern monarch is specially chosen by Heaven to guide and\r\ngovern a folk entrusted to him as the talent was entrusted to the\r\nsteward in Scripture. Until 1848, a little over sixty years ago, the\r\nEmperor (at that time only King of Prussia) was an absolute, or almost\r\nabsolute, monarch, supported by soldiers and police, and his wishes\r\nwere practically law to the folk. In that year, however, owing to the\r\ninfluence of the French Revolution, the King by the gift of a\r\nConstitution, abandoned part of his powers, but not any governing\r\npowers, to the folk in the form of a parliament, with permission to\r\nmake laws for itself, though not for him. To pass them, that is; for\r\nthey were not to carry the laws into execution--that was a matter the\r\nKing kept, as the Emperor does still, in his own hands.\r\n\r\nThe business of making laws being, as experience shows, provocative of\r\ndiscussion, discussion of argument, and argument of controversy, there\r\nnow arose a dozen or more parties in the Parliament, each with its own\r\nset of controversial opinions, and these the parties applied to the\r\nnovel and interesting occupation of law-making.\r\n\r\nHowever, it did not matter much to the King, so long as the folk did\r\nnot ask for further, or worse still, as occurred in England, for all\r\nhis powers; and accordingly the parties continued their discussions,\r\nas they do to-day, sometimes accepting and sometimes rejecting their\r\nown or the King's suggestions about law-making. Generally speaking,\r\nthe relation is not unlike that established by the dame who said to\r\nher husband, \"When we are of the same opinion, you are right, but when\r\nwe are of different opinions, I am right.\" If the Parliament does not\r\nagree with the Emperor, the Emperor dissolves it.\r\n\r\nThese parties, from the situation of their seats in a parliament of\r\n397 deputies, became known as the parties of the Right, or\r\nConservative parties, and the parties of the Left, or Liberal parties.\r\nBetween them sat the members of the Centre, who, as representing the\r\nCatholic populations of Germany--roughly, twenty-two millions out of\r\nsixty-six--became a powerful and unchanging phalanx of a hundred\r\ndeputies, which had interests and tactics of its own independently of\r\nRight or Left.\r\n\r\nBy and by, one of the parties of the Left, representing the classes\r\nwho work with their hands as distinguished from the classes who work\r\nwith their heads, thought they would like to live under a political\r\nsystem of their own making and began to show a strong desire to take\r\nall power from the King and from the Parliament too. They agitated and\r\norganized, and organized and agitated, until at length, having settled\r\non what was found to be an attractive theory, they made a wholly\r\nseparate party, almost a people and parliament of their own. This is\r\nknown as the Social Democracy, with, at present, no deputies.\r\n\r\nSuch, in a comparatively few sentences, is the political state of\r\nthings in Germany. It might indeed be expressed in still fewer words,\r\nas follows: Heaven gave the royal house of Hohenzollern, as a present,\r\na folk. The Hohenzollerns gave the folk, as a present, a parliament, a\r\npower to make laws without the power of executing them. The Social\r\nDemocrats broke off from the folk and took an anti-Hohenzollern and\r\nanti-popular attitude, and the folk in their Parliament divided into\r\nparties to pass the time, and--of course--make laws.\r\n\r\nThis may seem to be treating an important subject with levity. It is\r\nintended merely as a statement of the facts. The system in Germany\r\nworks well, to an Englishman indeed surprisingly so. In England there\r\nis no Heaven-appointed king; all the powers of the King, both that of\r\nmaking laws and of administering them, have long ago been taken by the\r\npeople from the King and entrusted by them to a parliament, the\r\nmajority of whom, called the Government, represent the majority of the\r\nelecting voters. In the case of Germany the folk have surrendered some\r\nof what an Englishman would term their \"liberties,\" for example, the\r\nright to govern, to the King, to be used for the common good; whereas\r\nin the case of England, the people do not think it needful to\r\nsurrender any of their liberties, least of all the government of their\r\ncountry, in order to attain the same end.\r\n\r\nThus, while the German Emperor and the German folk have the same aims\r\nas the English King and the English people, the common weal and the\r\nfair fame of their respective countries, the two monarchs and the two\r\npeoples have agreed on almost contrary ways of trying to secure them.\r\n\r\nThe political system of Germany has had to be sketched introductorily\r\nas for the Englishman, a necessary preliminary to an understanding of\r\nthe German Emperor's character and policy. One of the most important\r\nresults of the character and policy is the state of Anglo-German\r\nrelations; and the writer is convinced that if the character and\r\npolicy were better and more generally known there would be no\r\nestrangement between the two countries, but, much more probably,\r\nmutual respect and mutual good-will.\r\n\r\nWith the growth of this knowledge, the writer is tempted to believe,\r\nwould cease a delusion that appears to exist in the minds, or rather\r\nthe imaginations, of two great peoples, the delusion that the highest\r\nnational interests of both are fundamentally irreconcilable, and that\r\nthe policies of their Governments are fundamentally opposed.\r\n\r\nIt seems indeed as though neither in England nor in Germany has the\r\nleast attention been paid to the astonishing growth of commerce\r\nbetween the countries or to the repeated declarations made through a\r\nlong series of years by the respective Governments on their countries'\r\nbehalf. The growth in commerce needs no statistics to prove it, for it\r\nis a matter of everyday observation and comment. The English\r\nGovernment declares it a vital necessity for an insular Power like\r\nGreat Britain, with colonies and duties appertaining to their\r\npossession in all, and the most distant, parts of the world, to have a\r\nnavy twice as powerful as that of any other possibly hostile Power.\r\nThe ordinary German immediately cries out that England is planning to\r\nattack him, to annihilate his fleet, destroy his commerce, and\r\ndiminish his prestige among the nations. The German Government\r\nrepeatedly declares that the German fleet is intended for defence not\r\naggression, that Germany does not aim at the seizure of other people's\r\nproperty, but at protecting her growing commerce, at standing by her\r\nsubjects in all parts of the world if subjected to injury or insult,\r\nand at increasing her prestige, and with it her power for good, in the\r\nfamily of nations. The ordinary Englishman immediately cries out that\r\nGermany is seeking to dispute his maritime supremacy, to rob him of\r\nhis colonies, and to appropriate his trade. Is it not conceivable that\r\nboth Governments are telling the truth, and that their designs are no\r\nmore and no less than the Governments represent them to be? The\r\nnecessity for Great Britain possessing an all-powerful fleet that will\r\nkeep her in touch with her colonies if she is not to lose them\r\naltogether, is self-evident, and understood by even the most\r\nChauvinistic German. The necessity for Germany's possessing a fleet\r\nstrong enough to make her rights respected is as self-evident.\r\nMoreover, if Germany's fleet is a luxury, as Mr. Winston Churchill\r\nsays it is, she deserves and can afford it. As a nation she has\r\nprospered and grown great, not by a policy of war and conquest, but by\r\nhard work, thrift, self-denial, fidelity to international engagements,\r\nwell-planned instruction, and first-rate organization. Why should she\r\nnot, if she thinks it advisable and is willing to spend the money on\r\nit, supply herself with an arm of defence in proportion to her size,\r\nher prosperity, and her desert? It may be that, as Mr. Norman Angell\r\nholds, the entire policy of great armaments is based on economic\r\nerror; but unless and until it is clear that the German navy is\r\nintended for aggression, its growth may be viewed by the rest of the\r\nworld with equanimity, and by the Englishman, as a connoisseur in such\r\nmatters, with admiration as well. A man may buy a motor-car which his\r\nfriends and neighbours think must be costly and pretentious beyond his\r\nmeans; but that is his business; and if the man finds that, owing to\r\ngood management and industry and skill, his business is growing and\r\nthat a motor-car is, though in some not absolutely clear and definite\r\nway, of advantage to him in business and satisfying to his legitimate\r\npride--why on earth should he not buy or build it?\r\n\r\nThe truth is that if our ordinary Englishman and German were to sit\r\ndown together, and with the help of books, maps, and newspapers,\r\ncarefully and without prejudice, consider the annals of their\r\nrespective countries for the last sixteen years with a view to\r\nestablishing the causes of their delusion, they could hardly fail to\r\nconfess that it was due to neither believing a word the other said; to\r\neach crediting the other with motives which, as individuals and men of\r\nhonesty and integrity in the private relations of life, each would\r\nindignantly repudiate; to each assuming the other to be in the\r\ncondition of barbarism mankind began to emerge from nineteen hundred\r\nyears ago; to both supposing that Christianity has had so little\r\ninfluence on the world that peoples are still compelled to live and go\r\nabout their daily work armed to the teeth lest they may be bludgeoned\r\nand robbed by their neighbours; that the hundreds of treaties solemnly\r\nsigned by contracting nations are mere pieces of waste paper only\r\ntestifying to the profundity and extent of human hypocrisy; that\r\nchurches and cathedrals have been built, universities, colleges, and\r\nschools founded, only to fill the empty air with noise; that the\r\nprinting presses of all countries have been occupied turning out\r\nmyriads of books and papers which have had no effect on the reason or\r\nconscience of mankind; that nations learn nothing from experience; and\r\nto each supposing that he and his fellow-countrymen alone are the\r\nmonopolists of wisdom, honour, truth, justice, charity--in short, of\r\nall the attributes and blessings of civilization. Is it not time to\r\ndiscard such error, or must the nations always suspect each other? To\r\nfinish with our introduction, and notwithstanding that _qui s'excuse\r\ns'accuse_, the biographer may be permitted to say a few words on his\r\nown behalf. Inasmuch as the subject of his biography is still, as has\r\nbeen said, happily alive, and is, moreover, in the prime of his\r\nmaturity, his life cannot be reviewed as a whole nor the ultimate\r\nconsequences of his character and policy be foretold. The biographer\r\nof the living cannot write with the detachment permissible to the\r\nhistorian of the dead. No private correspondence of the Emperor's is\r\navailable to throw light on his more intimate personal disposition and\r\nrelationships. There have been many rumours of war since his\r\naccession, but no European war of great importance; and if a few minor\r\ncampaigns in tropical countries be excepted, Germany for over forty\r\nyears, thanks largely to the Emperor, has enjoyed the advantages of\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nFrom the pictorial and sensational point of view continuous peace is a\r\ndrawback for the biographer no less than for the historian. What would\r\nhistory be without war?--almost inconceivable; since wars, not peace,\r\nare the principal materials with which it deals and supply it with\r\nmost of its vitality and interest--must it also be admitted, its\r\ncharm? For what are Hannibal or Napoleon or Frederick the Great\r\nremembered?--for their wars, and little else. Shakespeare has it\r\nthat--\r\n\r\n     \"Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues\r\n     We write in water.\"\r\n\r\nWho, asks Heine, can name the artist who designed the cathedral of\r\nCologne? In this regard the biographer of an emperor is almost as\r\ndependent as the historian.\r\n\r\nThe biography of an emperor, again, must be to a large extent, the\r\nhistory of his reign, and in no case is this more true than in that of\r\nEmperor William. But he has been closely identified with every event\r\nof general importance to the world since he mounted the throne, and\r\nthe world's attention has been fastened without intermission on his\r\nwords and conduct. The rise of the modern German Empire is the salient\r\nfact of the world's history for the last half-century, and accordingly\r\nonly from this broader point of view will the Emperor's future\r\nbiographer, or the historian of the future, be able to do him or his\r\nEmpire justice.\r\n\r\nLastly, another difficulty, if one may call it so, experienced equally\r\nby the biographer and the historian, is the fact that the life of the\r\nEmperor has been blameless from the moral standpoint. On two or three\r\noccasions early in the reign accounts were published of scandals at\r\nthe Court. They may not have been wholly baseless, but none of them\r\ndirectly involved the Emperor, or even raised a doubt as to his\r\nrespectability or reputation. Take from history--or from biography for\r\nthat matter--the vices of those it treats of, and one-third, perhaps\r\none-half, of its \"human interest\" disappears.\r\n\r\nIn the circumstances, therefore, all the writer need add is that he\r\nhas done the best he could. He has ignored, certainly, at two or three\r\nstages of his narration, the demands of strict chronological\r\nsuccession; but if so, it has been to describe some of the more\r\nimportant events of the reign in their totality. He has also felt it\r\nnecessary, as writing for English readers of a country not their own,\r\nto combine a portion of history with his biography. If, at the same\r\ntime, he has ventured to infuse into both biography and history a\r\nslight admixture of philosophy, he can only hope that the fusion will\r\nnot prove altogether disagreeable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1859-1881\r\n\r\nAs the education of a prince, and the surroundings in which he is\r\nbrought up, are usually different from the education and surroundings\r\nof his subjects, it is not surprising if, at least during some portion\r\nof his reign, and until he has graduated in the university of life,\r\nmisunderstandings, if nothing worse, should occur between them: indeed\r\nthe wonder is that princes and people succeed in living harmoniously\r\ntogether. They are separated by great gulfs both of sentiment and\r\ncircumstance. Bismarck is quoted by one of his successors, Prince\r\nHohenlohe, as remarking that every King of Prussia, with whatever\r\npopularity he began his reign, was invariably hated at the close of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe prince that would rule well has to study the science of\r\ngovernment, itself a difficult and incompletely explored subject, and\r\nthe art of administration; he has to know history, and above all the\r\nhistory of his own country; not that history is a safe or certain\r\nguide, but that it informs him of traditions he will be expected to\r\ncontinue in his own country and respect in that of others; he must\r\nunderstand the political system under which his people choose to live,\r\nand the play of political, religious, economic, and social forces\r\nwhich are ever at work in a community; he must learn to speak and\r\nunderstand (not always quite the same thing) other languages besides\r\nhis own; and concurrently with these studies he must endeavour to\r\ndevelop in himself the personal qualities demanded by his high\r\noffice--health and activity of body, quick comprehension and decision,\r\na tenacious memory for names and faces, capacity for public speaking,\r\npatience, and that command over the passions and prejudices, natural\r\nor acquired, which is necessary for his moral influence as a ruler. On\r\nwhat percentage of his subjects is such a curriculum imposed, and what\r\nallowances should not be made if a full measure of success is not\r\nachieved?\r\n\r\nBut even when the prince has done all this, there is still a study,\r\nthe most comprehensive and most important of all, in which he should\r\nbe learned--the study of humanity, and in especial that part of it\r\nwith the care of whose interests and happiness he is to be charged. A\r\nfew people seem to have this knowledge instinctively, others acquire\r\nsomething of it in the school of sad experience. It is not the fault\r\nof the Emperor, if, in his youth, his knowledge of humanity was not\r\nprofound. There was always a strong vein of idealism and romance among\r\nHohenzollerns, the vein of a Lohengrin, a Tancred, or some mediæval\r\nknight. The Emperor, of course, never lived among the common people;\r\nnever had to work for a living in competition with a thousand others\r\nmore fortunate than he, or better endowed by nature with the qualities\r\nand gifts that make for worldly success; never, so far as is known to\r\na watchful and exceptionally curious public, endured domestic sorrow\r\nof a deep or lasting kind; never suffered materially or in his proper\r\nperson from ingratitude, carelessness, or neglect; never knew the\r\n\"penalty of Adam, the seasons' difference\"; never, in short, felt\r\nthose pains one or more of which almost all the rest of mankind have\r\nat one time or other to bear as best they may.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has always been happy in his family, happy in seeing his\r\ncountry prosperous, happy in the admiration and respect of the people\r\nof all nations; and if he has passed through some dark hours, he must\r\nfeel happy in having nobly borne them. Want of knowledge of the trials\r\nof ordinary humanity is, of course, no matter of reproach to him; on\r\nthe contrary, it is matter of congratulation; and, as several of his\r\nfrankest deliverances show, he has, both as man and monarch, felt many\r\na pang, many a regret, many a disappointment, the intensity of which\r\ncannot be gauged by those who have not felt the weight of his\r\nresponsibilities.\r\n\r\nA discharge of 101 guns in the gardens of Crown Prince Frederick's\r\npalace in Berlin on the morning of January 27, 1859, announced the\r\nbirth of the future Emperor. There were no portents in that hour.\r\nNature proceeded calmly with her ordinary tasks. Heaven gave no\r\nspecial sign that a new member of the Hohenzollern family had appeared\r\non the planet Earth. Nothing, in short, occurred to strengthen the\r\nfaith of those who believe in the doctrine of kingship by divine\r\nappointment.\r\n\r\nIt was a time of political and social turmoil in many countries, the\r\ngroundswell, doubtless, of the revolutionary wave of 1848. The Crimean\r\nWar, the Indian Mutiny, and the war with China had kept England in a\r\ncontinual state of martial fever, and the agitation for electoral\r\nreform was beginning. Lord Palmerston was Prime Minister, with Lord\r\nOdo Russell as Minister for Foreign Affairs and Mr. Gladstone as\r\nMinister of Finance. Napoleon III was at war with Austria as the ally\r\nof Italy, where King Emmanuel II and Cavour were laying the\r\nfoundations of their country's unity. Russia, after defeating Schamyl,\r\nthe hero of the Caucasus, was pursuing her policy of penetration in\r\nCentral Asia.\r\n\r\nIn Prussia the unrest was chiefly domestic. The country, while\r\nnominally a Great Power, was neutral during the Crimean War, and\r\nplayed for the moment but a small part in foreign politics. Bismarck,\r\nin his \"Gedanke und Erinnerungen,\" compares her submission to Austria\r\nto the patience of the French noble-man he heard of when minister in\r\nParis, whose conduct in condoning twenty-four acts of flagrant\r\ninfidelity on the part of his wife was regarded by the French as an\r\nact of great forbearance and magnanimity. Prince William, the\r\nEmperor's grandfather, afterwards William I, first German Emperor, was\r\non the throne, acting as Prince Regent for his brother, Frederick\r\nWilliam IV, incapacitated from ruling by an affection of the brain.\r\nThe head of the Prussian Ministry, Manteuffel, had been dismissed, and\r\na \"new era,\" with ministers of more liberal tendencies, among them von\r\nBethmann Hollweg, an ancestor of the present Chancellor, had begun.\r\nGeneral von Roon was Minister of War and Marine, offices at that time\r\nunited in one department. The Italian War had roused Germany anew to a\r\ndesire for union, and a great \"national society\" was founded at\r\nFrankfurt, with the Liberal leader, Rudolf von Bennigsen, at its head.\r\nPublic attention was occupied with the subject of reorganizing the\r\narmy and increasing it from 150,000 to 210,000 men. Parliament was on\r\nthe eve of a bitter constitutional quarrel with Bismarck, who became\r\nPrussian Prime Minister (Minister President) in 1862, about the grant\r\nof the necessary army funds. Most of the great intellects of\r\nGermany--Kant, Goethe, Schiller, Hegel, Fichte, Schleiermacher--had\r\nlong passed away. Heinrich Heine died in Paris in 1856. Frederick\r\nNietzsche was a youth, Richard Wagner's \"Tannhäuser\" had just been\r\ngreeted, in the presence of the composer, with a storm of hisses in\r\nthe Opera house at Paris. The social condition of Germany may be\r\npartially realized if one remembers that the death-rate was over 28\r\nper _mille_, as compared with 17 per _mille_ to-day; that only a start\r\nhad been made with railway construction; that the country, with its\r\nnot very generous soil, depended wholly upon agriculture; that\r\nsavings-bank deposits were not one-twelfth of what they are now; that\r\nthere were 60 training schools where there are 221 to-day, and 338\r\nevening classes as against 4,588 in 1910; that many of the principal\r\ntowns were still lighted by oil; that there was practically no navy;\r\nand that the bulk of the aristocracy lived on about the same scale as\r\nthe contemporary English yeoman farmer. Berlin contained a little less\r\nthan half a million inhabitants, compared with its three and a half\r\nmillions of to-day, and the state of its sanitation may be imagined\r\nfrom the fact that open drains ran down the streets.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's father, Frederick III, second German Emperor, was\r\naffectionately known to his people as \"unser Fritz,\" because of his\r\nliberal sympathies and of his high and kindly character. To most\r\nEnglishmen he is perhaps better known as the husband of the Princess,\r\nafterwards Empress, Adelaide Victoria, eldest daughter of Queen\r\nVictoria, and mother of the Emperor. Frederick III had no great share\r\nin the political events which were the birth-pangs of modern Germany,\r\nunless his not particularly distinguished leadership in the war of\r\n1866 and that with France be so considered. The greater part of his\r\nlife was passed as Crown Prince, and a Crown Prince in Germany leads a\r\nlife more or less removed from political responsibilities. He\r\nsucceeded his father, William I, on the latter's death, March 9, 1888,\r\nreigned for ninety-nine days, and died, on June 15th following, from\r\ncancer of the throat, after an illness borne with exemplary fortitude.\r\n\r\nTo what extent the character of his parents affected the character of\r\nthe Emperor it is impossible to determine. The Emperor seldom refers\r\nto his parents in his speeches, and reserves most of his panegyric for\r\nhis grandfather and his grandfather's mother, Queen Louise; but the\r\ncomparative neglect is probably due to no want of filial admiration\r\nand respect, while the frequent references to his grandfather in\r\nparticular are explained by the great share the latter took in the\r\nformation of the Empire and by his unbounded popularity. The Crown\r\nPrince was an affectionate but not an easy-going father, with a\r\npassion for the arts and sciences; his mother also was a\r\ndisciplinarian, and, equally with her husband, passionately fond of\r\nart; and it is therefore not improbable that these traits descended to\r\nthe Emperor. As to whether the alleged \"liberality\" of the Crown\r\nPrince descended to him depends on the sense given to the word\r\n\"liberal.\" If it is taken to mean an ardent desire for the good and\r\nhappiness of the people, it did; if it is taken to mean any\r\ninclination to give the people authority to govern themselves and\r\ndirect their own destinies, it did not.\r\n\r\nThe mother of the Emperor, the Empress Frederick, had much of Queen\r\nVictoria's good sense and still more of her strong will. A thoroughly\r\nEnglish princess, she had, in German eyes, one serious defect: she\r\nfailed to see, or at least to acknowledge, the superiority of most\r\nthings German to most things English. She had an English nurse, Emma\r\nHobbs, to assist at the birth of the future Emperor. She made English\r\nthe language of the family life, and never lost her English tastes and\r\nsympathies; consequently she was called, always with an accent of\r\nreproach, \"the Engländerin,\" and in German writings is represented as\r\nhaving wished to anglicize not only her husband, her children, and her\r\nCourt, but also her adopted country and its people. A chaplain of the\r\nEnglish Church in Berlin, the Rev. J.H. Fry, who met her many times,\r\ndescribes her as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"She was not the wife for a German Emperor, she so English\r\n     and insisted so strongly on her English ways. The result was\r\n     that she was very unpopular in Germany, and the Germans said\r\n     many wicked things of her. She hated Berlin, and if her son,\r\n     the present Emperor, had not required that she should come\r\n     to the capital every winter, she would have lived altogether\r\n     at Cronberg in the villa an Italian friend bequeathed to\r\n     her.\r\n\r\n     \"She was extremely musical, had extensively cultivated her\r\n     talents in this respect, and was an accomplished linguist.\r\n     Like her mother, Queen Victoria, she was unusually\r\n     strong-minded, and was always believed to rule over her\r\n     amiable and gentle husband. Her interest in the English\r\n     community was great, another reason for the dislike with\r\n     which the Germans regarded her. To her the community owes\r\n     the pretty little English church in the Mon Bijou Platz\r\n     (Berlin), which she used to attend regularly, and where a\r\n     funeral service, at which the Emperor was present, was held\r\n     in memory of her.\r\n\r\n     \"German feeling was further embittered against her by the\r\n     Morell Mackenzie incident, and to this day controversy rages\r\n     round the famous English surgeon's name. The controversy is\r\n     as to whether or not Morell Mackenzie honestly believed what\r\n     he said when he diagnosed the Emperor's illness as\r\n     non-cancerous in opposition to the opinion of distinguished\r\n     German doctors like Professor Bergmann. Under German law no\r\n     one can mount the throne of Prussia who is afflicted with a\r\n     mortal sickness. For long it had been suspected that the\r\n     Emperor's throat was fatally affected, and, therefore, when\r\n     King William was dying, it became of dynastic and national\r\n     importance to establish the fact one way or other. Queen\r\n     Victoria was ardently desirous of seeing her daughter an\r\n     Empress, and sent Sir Morrell Mackenzie to Germany to\r\n     examine the royal patient. On the verdict being given that\r\n     the disease was not cancer, the Crown Prince mounted the\r\n     throne, and Queen Victoria's ambition for her daughter was\r\n     realized.\r\n\r\n     \"The Empress also put the aristocracy against her by\r\n     introducing several relaxations into Court etiquette which\r\n     had up to her time been stiff and formal. Her relations with\r\n     Bismarck, as is well known, were for many years strained,\r\n     and on one occasion she made the remark that the tears he\r\n     had caused her to shed 'would fill tumblers.' On the whole\r\n     she was an excellent wife and mother. She was no doubt in\r\n     some degree responsible for the admiration of England as a\r\n     country and of the English as a people which is a marked\r\n     feature of the Emperor's character.\"\r\n\r\nThis account is fairly correct in its estimation of the Empress\r\nFrederick's character and abilities, but it repeats a popular error in\r\nsaying that German law lays down that no one can mount the Prussian\r\nthrone if he is afflicted with a mortal sickness. There is no \"German\r\nlaw\" on the subject, and the law intended to be referred to is the\r\nso-called \"house-law,\" which, as in the case of other German noble\r\nfamilies, regulates the domestic concerns of the House of\r\nHohenzollern. Bismarck disposes of the assertion that a Hohenzollern\r\nprince mortally stricken is not capable of succession as a \"fable,\"\r\nand adds that the Constitution, too, contains no stipulation of the\r\nsort. The influence of his mother on the Emperor's character did not\r\nextend beyond his childhood, while probably the only natural\r\ndispositions he inherited from her were his strength of will and his\r\nappreciation of classical art and music. Many of her political ideas\r\nwere diametrically opposed to those of her son. Her love of art made\r\nher pro-French, and her visit to Paris, it will be remembered, not\r\nbeing made _incognito_, led to international unpleasantness,\r\noriginating in the foolish Chauvinism of some leading French painters\r\nwhose ateliers she desired to inspect. She believed in a homogeneous\r\nGerman Empire without any federation of kingdoms and states, advocated\r\na Constitution for Russia, and was satisfied that the common sense of\r\na people outweighed its ignorance and stupidity.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has four sisters and a brother. The sisters are Charlotte,\r\nborn in 1860, and married to the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Meiningen;\r\nVictoria, born in 1866, and married to Prince Adolphus of\r\nSchaumberg-Lippe; Sophie, born in 1870, and married to King\r\nConstantine, of Greece; and Margarete, born in 1872, and married to\r\nPrince Friederich Karl of Hessen.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's only brother, Prince Henry of Prussia, was born in 1862,\r\nand is married to Princess Irene of Hessen. He is probably the most\r\npopular Hohenzollern to-day. He adopted the navy as a profession and\r\ndevotes himself to its duties, taking no part in politics. Like the\r\nEmperor himself and the Emperor's heir, the Crown Prince, he is a\r\ngreat promoter of sport, and while a fair golfer (with a handicap of\r\n14) and tennis player, gives much of his leisure to the encouragement\r\nof the automobile and other industries. Every Hohenzollern is supposed\r\nto learn a handicraft. The Emperor did not, owing to his shortened\r\nleft arm. Prince Henry learned book-binding under a leading Berlin\r\nbookbinder, Herr Collin. The Crown Prince is a turner. Prince Henry\r\nseems perfectly satisfied with his position in the Empire as\r\nInspector-General of the Fleet, stands to attention when talking to\r\nthe Emperor in public, and on formal occasions addresses him as\r\n\"Majesty\" like every one else. Only in private conversation does he\r\nallow himself the use of the familiar _Du_. The Emperor has a strong\r\naffection for him, and always calls him \"Heinrich.\"\r\n\r\nMany stories are current in Germany relating to the early part of the\r\nEmperor's boyhood. Some are true, others partially so, while others\r\nagain are wholly apochryphal. All, however, are more or less\r\ncharacteristic of the boy and his surroundings, and for this reason a\r\nselection of them may be given. Apropos of his birth, the following\r\nstory is told. An artillery officer went to receive orders for the\r\nsalute to be discharged when the birth occurred. They were given him\r\nby the then Prince Regent, afterwards Emperor William I. The officer\r\nshowed signs of perplexity. \"Well, is there anything else?\" inquired\r\nthe Regent. \"Yes, Royal Highness; I have instructions for the birth of\r\na prince and for that of a princess (which would be 30 guns); but what\r\nif it should be twins?\" The Regent laughed. \"In that case,\" he said,\r\n\"follow the Prussian rule--_suum cuique_.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the child was born the news ran like wildfire through Berlin, and\r\nall the high civil and military officials drove off in any vehicle\r\nthey could find to offer their congratulations. The Regent, who was at\r\nthe Foreign Office, jumped into a common cab. Immediately after him\r\nappeared tough old Field-Marshal Wrangel, the hero of the Danish wars.\r\nHe wrote his name in the callers' book, and on issuing from the palace\r\nshouted to the assembled crowd, \"Children, it's all right: a fine\r\nstout recruit.\" On the evening of the birth a telegram came from Queen\r\nVictoria, \"Is it a fine boy?\" and the answer went back, \"Yes, a very\r\nfine boy.\"\r\n\r\nAnother story describes how the child was brought to submit cheerfully\r\nto the ordeal of the tub. He was \"water-shy,\" like the vast majority\r\nof Germans at that time, and the nurses had to complain to his father,\r\nCrown Prince Frederick, of his resistance. The Crown Prince thereupon\r\ndirected the sentry at the palace gate not to salute the boy when he\r\nwas taken out for his customary airing. The boy remarked the neglect\r\nand complained to his father, who explained that \"sentries were not\r\nallowed to present arms to an unwashed prince.\" The stratagem\r\nsucceeded, and thereafter the lad submitted to the bathing with a good\r\ngrace.\r\n\r\nLike all boys, the lad was fond of the water, though now in another\r\nsense. At the age of two, nursery chroniclers relate, he had a toy\r\nboat, the _Fortuna_, in which he sat and see-sawed--and learned not to\r\nbe sea-sick! At three he was put into sailor's costume, with the\r\nbell-shaped trousers so dear to the hearts of English mothers fifty\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nAt the age of four he had a memorable experience, though it is hardly\r\nlikely that now, after the lapse of half a century, he remembers much\r\nabout it. This was his first visit to England in 1863, when he was\r\ntaken by his parents to be present at the marriage of his uncle, King\r\nEdward VII, then Prince of Wales. The boy, in pretty Highland costume,\r\nwas an object of general attention, and occupies a prominent place in\r\nthe well-known picture of the wedding scene by the artist Frith. The\r\nensuing fifteen years saw him often on English soil with his father\r\nand mother, staying usually at Osborne Castle, in the Isle of Wight.\r\nHere, it may be assumed, he first came in close contact with the\r\nocean, watched the English warships passing up and down, and imbibed\r\nsome of that delight in the sea which is not the least part of the\r\nheritage of Englishmen. The visits had a decided effect on him, for at\r\nten we find him with a row-boat on the Havel and learning to swim, and\r\non one occasion rowing a distance of twenty-five miles between 6 a.m.\r\nand 3 p.m. About this time he used to take part with his parents in\r\nexcursions on the _Royal Louise_, a miniature frigate presented by\r\nGeorge IV to Frederick William III.\r\n\r\nStill another story concerns the boy and his father. The former came\r\none day in much excitement to his tutor and said his father had just\r\nblamed him unjustly. He told the tutor what had really happened and\r\nasked him, if, under the circumstances, he was to blame. The tutor was\r\nin perplexity, for if he said the father had acted unjustly, as in\r\nfact he thought he had, he might lessen the son's filial respect.\r\nHowever, he gave his candid opinion. \"My Prince,\" he said, \"the\r\ngreatest men of all times have occasionally made mistakes, for to err\r\nis human. I must admit I think your father was in the wrong.\"\r\n\"Really!\" cried the lad, who looked pained. \"I thought you would tell\r\nme I was in the wrong, and as I know how right you always are I was\r\nready to go to papa and beg his pardon. What shall I do now?\" \"Leave\r\nit to me,\" the tutor said, and afterwards told the Crown Prince what\r\nhad passed. The Crown Prince sent for his son, who came and stood with\r\ndowncast eyes some paces off. The Crown Prince only uttered the two\r\nwords, \"My son,\" but in a tone of great affection. As he folded the\r\nPrince in his arms he reached his hand to the tutor, saying, \"I thank\r\nyou. Be always as true to me and to my son as you have been in this\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nThe last anecdote belongs also to the young Prince's private tutor\r\ndays. At one time a certain Dr. D. was teaching him. Every morning at\r\neleven work was dropped for a quarter of an hour to enable the pair,\r\nteacher and pupil, to take what is called in German \"second\r\nbreakfast.\" The Prince always had a piece of white bread and butter,\r\nwith an apple, a pear, or other fruit, while the teacher was as\r\nregularly provided with something warm--chop, a cutlet, a slice of\r\nfish, salmon, perch, trout, or whatever was in season, accompanied by\r\nsalad and potatoes. The smell of the meat never failed to appeal to\r\nthe olfactory nerves of the Prince, and he often looked, longingly\r\nenough, at the luxuries served to his tutor. The latter noticed it and\r\nfelt sorry for him; but there was nothing to be done: the royal orders\r\nwere strict and could not be disobeyed. One day, however, the lesson,\r\none of repetition, had gone so well that in a moment of gratitude the\r\ntutor decided to reward his pupil at all hazards. The lunch appeared,\r\nsteaming \"perch-in-butter\" for the tutor, and a plate of bread and\r\nbutter and some grapes for the pupil. The Prince cast a glance at the\r\nsavoury dish and was then about to attack his frugal fare when the\r\ntutor suddenly said, \"Prince, I'm very fond of grapes. Can't we for\r\nonce exchange? You eat my perch and I--\" The Prince joyfully agreed,\r\nplates were exchanged, and both were heartily enjoying the meal when\r\nthe Crown Prince walked in. Both pupil and tutor blushed a little, but\r\nthe Crown Prince said nothing and seemed pleased to hear how well the\r\nlesson had gone that day. At noon, however, as the tutor was leaving\r\nthe palace, a servant stopped him and said, \"His Royal Highness the\r\nCrown Prince would like to speak with the Herr Doktor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Herr Doktor,\" said the Crown Prince, \"tell me how it was that the\r\nPrince to-day was eating the warm breakfast and you the cold.\"\r\n\r\nThe tutor tried to make as little of the affair as possible. It was a\r\njoke, he said, he had allowed himself, he had been so well pleased\r\nwith his pupil that morning.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I will pass it over this time,\" said the Crown Prince,\r\n\r\n     \"but I must ask you to let the Prince get accustomed to bear\r\n     the preference shown to his tutor and allow him to be\r\n     satisfied with the simple food suitable for his age. What\r\n     will he eat twenty years hence, if he now gets roast meat?\r\n     Bread and fruit make a wholesome and perfectly satisfactory\r\n     meal for a lad of his years.\"\r\n\r\nDuring second breakfast next day, the Prince took care not to look up\r\nfrom his plate of fruit, but when he had finished, murmured as though\r\nby way of grace, \"After all, a fine bunch of grapes is a splendid\r\nlunch, and I really think I prefer it, Herr Doktor, to your\r\nnice-smelling perch-in-butter.\"\r\n\r\nThe time had now come when the young Prince was to leave the paternal\r\ncastle and submit to the discipline of school. The parents, one may be\r\nsure, held many a conference on the subject. The boy was beginning to\r\nhave a character of his own, and his parents doubtless often had in\r\nmind Goethe's lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"Denn wir können die Kinder nach unserem Willen nicht formen,\r\n     So wie Gott sie uns gab, so muss man sie lieben und haben,\r\n     Sie erzielen aufs best und jeglichen lassen gewähren.\"\r\n\r\n     (\"We cannot have children according to our will:\r\n     as God gave them so must we love and keep them:\r\n     bring them up as best we can and leave each to its own\r\n       development.\")\r\n\r\nIt had always been Hohenzollern practice to educate the Heir to the\r\nThrone privately until he was of an age to go to the university, but\r\nthe royal parents now decided to make an important departure from it\r\nby sending their boy to an ordinary public school in some carefully\r\nchosen place. The choice fell on Cassel, a quiet and beautiful spot\r\nnot far from Wilhelmshohe, near Homburg, where there is a Hohenzollern\r\ncastle, and which was the scene of Napoleon's temporary detention\r\nafter the capitulation of Sedan. Here at the Gymnasium, or _lycée_,\r\nfounded by Frederick the Great, the boy was to go through the regular\r\nschool course, sit on the same bench with the sons of ordinary\r\nburghers, and in all respects conform to the Gymnasium's regulations.\r\nThe decision to have the lad taught for a time in this democratic\r\nfashion was probably due to the influence of his English mother, who\r\nmay have had in mind the advantages of an English public school. The\r\nexperiment proved in every way successful, though it was at the time\r\nadversely criticized by some ultra-patriotic writers in the press. To\r\nthe boy himself it must have been an interesting and agreeable\r\nnovelty. Hitherto he had been brought up in the company of his\r\nbrothers and sisters in Berlin or Potsdam, with an occasional\r\n\"week-end\" at the royal farm of Bornstedt near the latter, the only\r\noccasions when he was absent from home being sundry visits to the\r\nGrand Ducal Court at Karlsruhe, where the Grand Duchess was an aunt on\r\nhis father's side, and to the Court at Darmstadt, where the Grand\r\nDuchess was an aunt on the side of his mother.\r\n\r\nAn important ceremony, however, had to be performed before his\r\ndeparture for school--his confirmation. It took place at Potsdam on\r\nSeptember 1, 1874, amid a brilliant crowd of relatives and friends,\r\nand included the following formal declaration by the young Prince:\r\n\r\n     \"I will, in childlike faith, be devoted to God all the days\r\n     of my life, put my trust in Him and at all times thank Him\r\n     for His grace. I believe in Jesus Christ, the Saviour and\r\n     Redeemer. Him who first loved me I will love in return, and\r\n     will show this love by love to my parents, my dear\r\n     grandparents, my sisters and brothers and relatives, but\r\n     also to all men. I know that hard tasks await me in life,\r\n     but they will brace me up, not overcome me. I will pray to\r\n     God for strength and develop my bodily powers.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy and his brother Henry stayed in Cassel for three years, in the\r\nwinter occupying a villa near the Gymnasium with Dr. Hinzpeter, and in\r\nsummer living in the castle of Wilhelmshohe hard by. Besides attending\r\nthe usual school classes, they were instructed by private tutors in\r\ndancing, fencing, and music. Both pupils are represented as having\r\nbeen conscientious, and as moving among their schoolmates without\r\naffectation or any special consciousness of their birth or rank. Many\r\nyears afterwards the Emperor, when revisiting Cassel, thus referred to\r\nhis schooldays there:\r\n\r\n     \"I do not regret for an instant a time which then seemed so\r\n     hard to me, and I can truly say that work and the working\r\n     life have become to me a second nature. For this I owe\r\n     thanks to Cassel soil;\"\r\n\r\nand later in the same speech:\r\n\r\n     \"I am pleased to be on the ground where, directed by expert\r\n     hands, I learned that work exists not only for its own sake,\r\n     but that man in work shall find his entire joy.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the right spirit; but if he had said \"greatest joy\" and \"can\r\nfind,\" he would have said something more completely true.\r\n\r\nThe life at Cassel was simple, and the day strictly divided. The\r\nfuture Emperor rose at six, winter and summer, and after a breakfast\r\nof coffee and rolls refreshed his memory of the home repetition-work\r\nlearned the previous evening. He then went to the Gymnasium, and when\r\nhis lessons there were over, took a walk with his tutor before lunch.\r\nHome tasks followed, and on certain days private instruction was\r\nreceived in English, French, and drawing. His English and French\r\nbecame all but faultless, and he learned to draw in rough-and-ready,\r\nif not professionally expert fashion. Wednesdays and Saturdays, which\r\nwere half-holidays, were spent roving in the country, especially in\r\nthe forest, with two or three companions of his own age. In winter\r\nthere was skating on the ponds. The Sunday dinner was a formal affair,\r\nat which royal relatives, who doubtless came to see how the princes\r\nwere getting on, and high officials from Berlin, were usually present.\r\nAfter dinner the princes took young friends up to their private rooms\r\nand played charades, in which on occasion they amused themselves with\r\nthe ever-delightful sport of taking off and satirizing their\r\ninstructors. At this time the future Emperor's favourite subjects were\r\nhistory and literature, and he was fond of displaying his rhetorical\r\ntalent before the class. The classical authors of his choice were\r\nHomer, Sophocles, and Horace. Homer particularly attracted him; it is\r\neasy to imagine the conviction with which, as a Hohenzollern, he would\r\ndeliver the declaration of King Agamemnon to Achilles:--\r\n\r\n     \"And hence, to all the host it shall be known\r\n     That kings are subject to the gods alone.\"\r\n\r\nThe young Prince left Cassel in January, 1877, after passing the exit\r\n(_abiturient_) examination, a rather severe test, twelfth in a class\r\nof seventeen. The result of the examination was officially described\r\nas \"satisfactory,\" the term used for those who were second in degree\r\nof merit. On leaving he was awarded a gold medal for good conduct, one\r\nof three annually presented by a patron of the Gymnasium.\r\n\r\nA foreign resident in Germany, who saw the young Prince at this time,\r\ntells of an incident which refers to the lad's appearance, and shows\r\nthat even at that early date anti-English feeling existed among the\r\npeople. It was at the military manoeuvres at Stettin:\r\n\r\n     \"Then the old Emperor came by. Tremendous cheers. Then\r\n     Bismarck and Moltke. Great acclaim. Then passed in a\r\n     carriage a thin, weakly-looking youth, and people in the\r\n     crowd said, 'Look at that boy who is to be our future\r\n     Emperor--his good German blood has been ruined by his\r\n     English training.'\"\r\n\r\nBefore closing the Emperor's record as a schoolboy it will be of\r\ninterest to learn the opinion of him formed by his French tutor at\r\nCassel, Monsieur Ayme, who has published a small volume on the\r\neducation of his pupil, and who, though evidently not too well\r\nsatisfied with his remuneration of £7 10s. a month, or with being\r\nrequired to pay his own fare back from Germany to France, writes\r\nfavourably of the young princes. \"The life of these young people\r\n(Prince William and Prince Henry) was,\" he says,\r\n\r\n     \"the most studious and peaceful imaginable. Up at six in the\r\n     morning, they prepared their tasks until it was time to go\r\n     to school. Lunch was at noon and tea at five. They went to\r\n     bed at nine or half-past. All their hours of leisure were\r\n     divided between lessons in French, English, music,\r\n     pistol-shooting, equitation, and walking. Now and then they\r\n     were allowed to play with boys of their own age, and on fête\r\n     days and their parents' birth-anniversaries they had the\r\n     privilege of choosing a play and seeing it performed at the\r\n     theatre. As pocket-money Prince William received 20s. a\r\n     month, and Henry 10s. Out of these modest sums they had to\r\n     buy their own notepaper and little presents for the servants\r\n     or their favourite companions.\"\r\n\r\nAs to Prince William's character as a schoolboy, Monsieur Ayme writes:\r\n\r\n     \"I do not suppose William was ever punished while he was in\r\n     Cassel. He was too proud to draw down upon himself\r\n     criticism, to him the worst form of punishment. At the\r\n     castle, as at school, he made it a point of honour to act\r\n     and work as if he had made his plans and resolved to stick\r\n     to them. He was always among the first of his class, and as\r\n     for me I never had any need to urge him on. If I pointed out\r\n     to him an error in his task he began it over again of his\r\n     own accord. We did grammar, analysis, dictations, and\r\n     compositions, and he got over his difficulties by sheer\r\n     perseverance. For example, if he was reading a fine page of\r\n     Victor Hugo, or the like, he hated to be interrupted, so\r\n     deeply was he interested in the subject he was reading.\r\n     Style and poetry had a great effect upon him; he expressed\r\n     admiration for the form and was aroused to enthusiasm by\r\n     generous or noble ideas. Frederick the Great was the hero of\r\n     his choice, a model of which he never ceased dreaming, and\r\n     which, like his grandfather, he proposed as his own. It is\r\n     easy to conceive that after ten or twelve years of such\r\n     study, regularly and methodically pursued, the Prince must\r\n     have possessed a literary and scientific baggage more varied\r\n     and extensive than that of his companions. And he worked\r\n     hard for it, few lads so hard. To speak the truth, he was\r\n     much more disciplined and much more deprived of freedom and\r\n     recreation of all sorts than most children of his age.\"\r\n\r\n_Par paranthèse_ may be introduced here a reference to Prince Henry,\r\nof whom Monsieur Ayme writes less enthusiastically.\r\n\r\n     \"One day,\" the tutor writes, \"I was dictating to him\r\n     something in which mention of a queen occurs. I came to the\r\n     words '... in addition to her natural distinction she\r\n     possessed that August majesty which is the appanage of\r\n     princesses of the blood royal....'\r\n\r\n     \"Prince Henry laid down his pen and remarked, 'The author\r\n     who wrote this piece did not live much with queens.'\r\n\r\n     \"'Why?' I asked.\r\n\r\n     \"'Because I never observed the August majesty which attaches\r\n     to princesses of the blood royal, and yet I have been\r\n     brought up among them,' was the reply.\r\n\r\n     \"William, however,\" continues Monsieur Ayme, \"was the\r\n     thinker, prudent and circumspect; the wise head which knew\r\n     that it was not all truths which bear telling. He was not\r\n     less loyal and constant in his opinions. He admired the\r\n     French Revolution, and the declaration contained in 'The\r\n     Rights of Man,' though this did not prevent his declaiming\r\n     against the Terrorists.\"\r\n\r\nOne incident in particular must have appealed to the French tutor.\r\nMonsieur Ayme and his Prussian pupil one day began discussing the\r\ndelicate question of the war of 1870. In the course of the discussion\r\nboth parties lost their tempers, until at last Prince William suddenly\r\ngot up and left the room. He remained silent and \"huffed\" for some\r\ndays, but at last he took the Frenchman aside and made him a formal\r\napology. \"I am very sorry indeed,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"that you took seriously my conduct of the other day. I\r\n     meant nothing by it, and I regret it hurt you. I am all the\r\n     more sorry, because I offended in your case a sentiment\r\n     which I respect above any in the world, the love of\r\n     country.\"\r\n\r\nBut it is time to pass from the details of the Emperor's early youth,\r\nand observe him during the two years he spent, with interruptions, at\r\nthe university. From Cassel he went immediately to Bonn, where, as\r\nduring the years of military duty which followed, we only catch\r\nglimpses of him as he lived the ordinary, and by no means austere,\r\nlife of the university student and soldier of the time; that is to\r\nsay, the ordinary life with considerable modifications and exceptions.\r\nHe did not, like young Bismarck, drink huge flagons of beer at a\r\nsitting, day after day. He was not followed everywhere by a\r\nboar-hound. He fought no student's duels--though a secret performance\r\nof the kind is mentioned as a probability in the chronicles--or go\r\nabout looking for trouble generally as the swashbuckling Junker,\r\nBismarck, did; for in the first place his royal rank would not allow\r\nof his taking part in the bloody amusement of the _Mensur_, and his\r\nnatural disposition, if it was quick and lively, was not choleric\r\nenough to involve him in serious quarrel. His studies were to some\r\nextent interrupted by military calls to Berlin, for after being\r\nappointed second lieutenant in the First Regiment of Foot Guards at\r\nPotsdam on his tenth birthday, the Hohenzollern age for entering the\r\narmy, he was promoted to first lieutenant in the same regiment on\r\nleaving Cassel.\r\n\r\nFor the most part the university lectures he attended were the courses\r\nin law and philosophy, and he is not reported to have shown any\r\nparticular enthusiasm for either subject. The differences between an\r\nEnglish and a German university are of a fundamental kind, perhaps the\r\ngreatest being that the German university does not aim at influencing\r\nconduct and character in the same measure as the English, but is\r\nrather for the supply of knowledge of all sorts, as a monster\r\nwarehouse is for the supply of miscellaneous goods. Again, the German\r\nuniversity, which, like all American universities except Princetown,\r\nhas more resemblance to the Scottish universities than to those at\r\nOxford, Cambridge, or Dublin, is not residential nor divided into\r\ncolleges, but is departmentalized into \"faculties,\" each with its own\r\nprofessors and _privat docentes_, or official lecturers, mostly young\r\nsavants, who have not the rank or title of professor, but have\r\nobtained only the _venia legendi_ from the university. The lectures,\r\nas a rule of admirable learning and thoroughness, invariably laying\r\ngreat and prosy stress on \"development,\" are delivered in large halls\r\nand may be subscribed for in as many faculties as the student chooses,\r\nthe cost being about thirty shillings or there-abouts per term for\r\neach lecture \"heard.\" Outside the university the student enjoys\r\ncomplete independence, which is a privilege highly (and sometimes\r\nviolently) cherished, especially by non-studious undergraduates, under\r\nthe name \"academic freedom.\" The German preparing for one or other of\r\nthe learned professions will probably spend a year or two at each of\r\nthree, or maybe four, universities, according to the special faculty\r\nhe adopts and for which the university has a reputation. There are\r\nplenty of hard-working students of course; nowadays probably the great\r\nmajority are of this kind; but to a large proportion also the\r\nuniversity period is still a pleasant, free, and easy halting-place\r\nbetween the severe discipline and work of the school and the stern\r\nstruggle of the working world.\r\n\r\nThe social life of the English university is paralleled in Germany by\r\nassociations of students in student \"Corps,\" with theatrical uniforms\r\nfor their _Chargierte_ or officers, special caps, sometimes of\r\nextraordinary shape, swords, leather gauntlets, Wellington boots, and\r\nother distinguishing gaudy insignia. The Corps are more or less\r\nselect, the most exclusive of all being the Corps Borussia, which at\r\nevery university only admits members of an upper class of society,\r\nthough on rare occasions receiving in its ranks an exceptionally\r\naristocratic, popular, or wealthy foreigner. To this Corps, the name\r\nof which is the old form of \"Prussia,\" the Emperor belonged when at\r\nBonn, and in one or two of his speeches he has since spoken of the\r\nagreeable memories he retains in connexion with it and the practices\r\nobserved by it.\r\n\r\nCommon to all university associations in Germany--whether Corps,\r\nLandsmannschaft, Burschenschaft, or Turnerschaft--is the practice of\r\nthe _Mensur_, or student duel. It is not a duel in the sense usually\r\ngiven to the word in England, for it lacks the feature of personal\r\nhostility, hate, or injury, but is a particularly sanguinary form of\r\nthe English \"single-stick,\" in which swords take the place of sticks.\r\nThese swords (_Schläger_), called, curiously enough, _rapiere_, are\r\nlong and thin in the blade, and their weight is such that at every\r\nduel students are told off on whose shoulders the combatants can rest\r\ntheir outstretched sword-arm in the pauses of the combat caused by the\r\nduellists getting out of breath; consequently, an undersized student\r\nis usually chosen for this considerate office. The heads and faces of\r\nthe duellists are swathed in bandages--no small incentive to\r\nperspiration, the vital parts of their bodies are well protected\r\nagainst a fatal prick or blow, and the pricks or slashes must be\r\ndelivered with the hand and wrist raised head-high above the shoulder.\r\nIt is considered disgraceful to move the head, to shrink in the\r\nsmallest degree before the adversary, or even to show feeling when the\r\nmedical student who acts as surgeon in an adjoining room staunches the\r\nflow of blood or sews up the scars caused by the swords. The duel of a\r\nmore serious kind--that with pistols or the French rapier, or with the\r\nbare-pointed sabre and unprotected bodies--is punishable by law, and\r\nis growing rarer each year.\r\n\r\nTake a sabre duel--\"heavy sabre duel\" is the German name for\r\nit--arising out of a quarrel in a cafe or beer-house, and in which one\r\nof the opponents may be a foreigner affiliated to some Corps or\r\nBurschenschaft. Cards are exchanged, and the challenger chooses a\r\nsecond whom he sends to the opponent. The latter, if he accepts the\r\nchallenge, also appoints a second; the seconds then meet and arrange\r\nfor the holding of a court of honour. The court will probably consist\r\nof old Corps students--lawyer, a doctor, and two or three other\r\nmembers of the Corps or Burschenschaft. The court summons the\r\nopponents before it and hears their account of the quarrel; the\r\nseconds produce evidence, for example the bills at the cafe or\r\nbeer-hall, showing how much liquor has been consumed; also as to age,\r\nmarriage or otherwise, and so on. Then the court decides whether there\r\nshall be a duel, or not, and if so, in what form it shall be fought.\r\n\r\nThe duel may be fixed to take place at any time within six months, and\r\nmeanwhile the opponents industriously practise. The scene of the duel\r\nis usually the back room of some beer-hall, with locked doors between\r\nthe duellists and the police. The latter know very well what is going\r\non, but shut their eyes to it. The opponents take their places at\r\nabout a yard and a half distance from advanced foot to advanced foot,\r\nand a chalk line is drawn between them. Close behind each opponent is\r\nhis second with outstretched sword, ready to knock up the duellists'\r\nweapons in case of too dangerous an impetuosity in the onset. The\r\numpire _(Unparteiischer)_, unarmed, stands a little distance from the\r\nduellists. The latter are naked _to_ the waist, but wear a leather\r\napron like that of a drayman, covering the lower half of the chest,\r\nand another piece of leather, like a stock, protecting their necks and\r\njugular veins. The duel may last a couple of hours, and any number of\r\nrounds up to as many as two hundred may be fought. The rounds consist\r\nof three or four blows, and last about twenty seconds each, when the\r\nseconds, who have been watching behind their men in the attitude of a\r\nwicket-keeper, with their sword-points on the ground, jump in and\r\nknock up the duellists' weapons. When one duellist is disabled by skin\r\nwounds--there are rarely any others--or by want of breath, palpitation\r\nor the like, the duel is over, and the duellists shake hands. This\r\ndescription, with some slight modifications, applies to the ordinary\r\nCorps _Mensuren_, which are simply a bloody species of gymnastic\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion early in the reign the Emperor spoke of the Corps\r\nsystem with great enthusiasm, and especially endorsed the practice of\r\nthe _Mensur_. \"I am quite convinced,\" he said at Bonn in 1891, three\r\nyears after his accession,\r\n\r\n     \"that every young man who enters a Corps receives through\r\n     the spirit which rules in it, and supposing he imbibes the\r\n     spirit, his true directive in life. For it is the best\r\n     education for later life a young man can obtain. Whoever\r\n     pokes fun at the German student Corps is ignorant of its\r\n     true tendency, and I hope that so long as student Corps\r\n     exist the spirit which is fostered in them, and which\r\n     inspires strength and courage, will continue, and that for\r\n     all time the student will joyfully wield the _Schläger_.\"\r\n\r\nRegarding the _Mensur_, he went on:\r\n\r\n     \"Our _Mensuren_ are frequently misunderstood by the public,\r\n     but that must not let us be deceived. We who have been Corps\r\n     students, as I myself was, know better. As in the Middle\r\n     Ages through our gymnastic exercises (_Turniere_) the\r\n     courage and strength of the man was steeled, so by means of\r\n     the Corps spirit and Corps life is that measure of firmness\r\n     acquired which is necessary in later life, and which will\r\n     continue to exist as long as there are universities in\r\n     Germany.\"\r\n\r\nThe word for firmness used by the Emperor was _Festigkeit_, which may\r\nalso be translated determination, steadiness, fortitude, or\r\nresoluteness of character. It may be that practice of the _Mensur_,\r\nwhich is held almost weekly, has a lifelong influence on the German\r\nstudent's character. It probably enables him to look the adversary in\r\nthe eye--look \"hard\" at him, as the mariners in Mr. A.W. Jacobs's\r\ndelightful tales look at one another when some particularly ingenious\r\nlie is being produced. In a way, moreover, it may be said to\r\ncorrespond to boxing in English universities, schools, and gymnasia.\r\nBut, on the whole, the Anglo-Saxon spectator finds it difficult to\r\nunderstand how it can exercise any influence for good on the moral\r\ncharacter of a youth, or determine, as the Emperor says it does, a\r\ndisposition which is cowardly or weak by nature to bravery or\r\nstrength, save of a momentary and merely physical kind. The Englishman\r\nwho has been present at a _Mensur_ is rather inclined to think the\r\natmosphere too much that of a shambles, and the chief result of the\r\npractice the cultivation of braggadocio.\r\n\r\nBesides, the practice is illegal, and though purposely overlooked,\r\nsave in one German city, that of Leipzig, where it is punished with\r\nsome rigour, the Emperor, who is supposed to embody the majesty and\r\neffectiveness of the law, is hardly the person to recommend it. His\r\ninconsistency in the matter on one occasion placed him in an\r\nundignified position. Two officers of the army quarrelled, and one, an\r\ninfantry lieutenant, sent a challenge to the other, an army medical\r\nman. The latter refused on conscientious grounds, whereupon he was\r\ncalled on by a military court of honour to send in his resignation.\r\nThe case was sent up to the Emperor, who upheld the decision of the\r\ncourt of honour, adding the remark that if the surgeon had\r\nconscientious scruples on the point he should not remain in the army.\r\nAn irate Social Democratic editor thereupon pointed out that such a\r\ndecision came with a bad grace from a man with whom, or with any of\r\nwhose six sons, no one was allowed to fight. The Emperor is still a\r\nmember of the Borussia Corps, but chiefly shows his interest by\r\nkeeping its anniversaries in mind, by every few years attending one of\r\nits annual drinking festivals (_Commers_), and by paying a substantial\r\nyearly subscription.\r\n\r\nThe German student Corps, historically, go back to the fourteenth\r\ncentury, when the first European universities were established at\r\nBologna, Paris, and Orleans. Universities then were not so called from\r\nthe universality of their teachings, but rather as meaning a\r\ncorporation, confraternity, or collegium, and were in reality social\r\ncentres in the towns where they were instituted. The most renowned was\r\nthat of Paris, and here was founded the first student Corps. It was\r\ncalled the \"German Nation of Paris,\" a corporation of students, with\r\nstatutes, oaths, special costumes, and other distinctive features. At\r\nfirst, strange to say, it contained more Englishmen than Germans. The\r\n\"Nation\" had a procurator, a treasurer, and a bedell, the last to look\r\nafter the legal affairs of the association. Drinking was not the\r\nsupposed purpose of the society, but the Corps mostly assembled, as\r\nGerman Corps do to-day, for drinking purposes.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of German student associations Was the\r\nLandsmannschaft. To this society, composed of elders and juniors,\r\nnew-comers, called Pennales, were admitted after painful ceremonies\r\nand became something like the \"fags\" at an English public school. The\r\nobject of the original Landsmannschaft was to keep alive the spirit of\r\nnationality. The object of the German Corps is different. It is to\r\nbeget and perpetuate friendship, and this accounts for the steady\r\ngoodwill the Emperor has always shown towards the comrades of his Bonn\r\nand Borussia days.\r\n\r\nAn ancient form of Corps entertainment is called the Hospiz, now,\r\nhowever, much modified. Upon invitation the members of the Corps meet\r\nin a beer-hall or in the rooms of one of the Corps. The president is\r\nseated with a house-key on the table before him as a symbol of\r\nunfettered authority. As members arrive, the president takes away\r\ntheir sticks and swords and deposits them in a closet. The guests sit\r\ndown and are handed filled pipes and a lighted _fidibus_, or\r\npipe-lighter. Bread and butter and cheese, followed by coffee, are\r\noffered. After this, the real work of the evening begins--the\r\ndrinking. A large can of beer stands on a stool beside the president.\r\nThe latter calls for silence by rapping three times on the table with\r\nthe house-key, and the Hospiz is declared open. Thenceforward only the\r\npresident pours out the beer, unless he appoints a deputy during his\r\nabsence. The president's great aim and honour is to make every one,\r\nincluding himself, intoxicated. He begins by rapping the table with\r\nhis glass and saying \"Significat ein Glas.\" In response all drain\r\ntheir glasses. Then comes a \"health to all,\" and this is followed by a\r\n\"health to each.\" \"The Ladies\" follow, including toasts to the pretty\r\ngirls of the town, and ladies known to be favourites of those present.\r\nMarried ladies or women of bad reputation must not be toasted in the\r\nHospiz.\r\n\r\nA story is told of a toast the Emperor, in these his Lohengrin days,\r\nonce proposed at a Borussia meeting. \"On the Kreuzberg\" (a hill near\r\nBonn), he said,\r\n\r\n     \"I saw a picture, the ideal of a German woman. She united in\r\n     herself beauty of face and an imposing form, the roses in\r\n     her cheeks spoke of the modesty peculiar to our maids, and\r\n     her voice sounded harmoniously like the lute of the\r\n     Minnesingers on the Wartburg. She told me her name--may it\r\n     be blessed.\"\r\n\r\nThe toast found its way into the local papers and gave birth to a\r\nromantic legend connecting the future Emperor with a pretty and modest\r\ngirl of the town, but no true basis for it has ever been discovered.\r\n\r\nIn toasting the Ladies in a Hospiz each of those present may name the\r\nlady of his choice, and if two name the same lady they have a drinking\r\nbout to determine which is entitled to claim her. The one who first\r\nadmits that he can drink no more--usually signified by a hasty and\r\nzigzag retreat from the room--is declared the loser. If a guest comes\r\nlate to the Hospiz he must drink fast so as to catch up with earlier\r\narrivals, unless he has been drinking elsewhere, when he is let off\r\nwith drinking a \"general health.\"\r\n\r\nThe close of the Emperor's student days was marked by an event which\r\nwas to have a great influence on his life and happiness. It was in\r\n1879 that he made the acquaintance of the young lady who was, a couple\r\nof years later, to become his wife, and subsequently Empress. When at\r\nBonn Prince William had developed a liking for wild-game shooting, and\r\naccepted an invitation from Duke Frederick of Schleswig-Holstein to\r\nshoot pheasants at Primkenau Castle, the Duke's seat in Silesia. More\r\nthan one romantic story is current about the first meeting of the\r\nlovers, but that most generally credited, as it was published at or\r\nnear the time, represents the young sportsman as meeting the lady\r\naccidentally in the garden of the castle. He had arrived at night and\r\ngone shooting early next morning before being introduced to the family\r\nof his host, and on his return surprised the fair-haired and blue-eyed\r\nPrincess Auguste Victoria as she lay dozing in a hammock in the\r\ngarden. The student approached, the words \"little Rosebud\" on his\r\nlips, but hastily withdrew as the Princess, all blushes, awoke. The\r\npair met shortly afterwards at breakfast, when the visitor learned who\r\nthe \"little rosebud\" was whom he had surprised. The Princess was then\r\ntwenty-two, but looked much younger, a privilege from nature she still\r\npossesses in middle age. The impression made on the student was deep\r\nand lasting, and the engagement was announced on Valentine's Day, in\r\nFebruary, 1880. The marriage was celebrated on February 27th of the\r\nfollowing year at the royal palace in Berlin. Great popular rejoicing\r\nmarked the happy occasion, Berlin was gaily flagged to celebrate the\r\nformal entrance of the bride into the capital, and most other German\r\ncities illuminated in her honour. The imperial bridegroom came from\r\nPotsdam at the head of a military escort selected from his regiment\r\nand preceded the bridal cortege, in which the ancient coronation\r\ncarriage, with its smiling occupant, and drawn by eight prancing\r\nsteeds, was the principal feature. On the day following the marriage\r\nthe young couple went to Primkenau for the honeymoon.\r\n\r\nThe marriage with a princess of Schleswig-Holstein was not only an\r\nevent of general interest from the domestic and dynastic point of\r\nview. It had also political significance, for it meant the happy close\r\nof the troubled period of Prussian dealings with those conquered\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\nA story throwing light on the young bride's character is current in\r\nconnexion with her wedding. One of the hymns contained a\r\nstrophe--\"Should misfortune come upon us,\" which her friends wanted\r\nher to have omitted as striking too melancholy a note. \"No,\" she said,\r\n\r\n     \"let it be sung. I don't expect my new position to be always\r\n     a bed of roses. Prince William is of the same mind, and we\r\n     have both determined to bear everything in common, and thus\r\n     make what is unpleasant more endurable.\"\r\n\r\nSince the marriage their domestic felicity, as all the world is aware,\r\nhas never been troubled, and the example thus given to their subjects\r\nis one of the surest foundations of their influence and authority in\r\nGermany. The secret of this felicity, affection apart, is to be sought\r\nfor in the strong moral sense of the Emperor regarding what he owes to\r\nhimself and his people, but no less perhaps in the exemplary character\r\nof the Empress. As a girl at Primkenau she was a sort of Lady\r\nBountiful to the aged and sick on the estate, and led there the simple\r\nlife of the German country maiden of the time. It was not the day of\r\nelectric light and central heating and the telephone; hardly of lawn\r\ntennis, certainly not of golf and hockey; while motor-cars and\r\nmilitant suffragettes were alike unknown. Instead of these delights\r\nthe Princess, as she then was, was content with the humdrum life of a\r\nGerman country mansion, with rare excursions into the great world\r\nbeyond the park gates, with her religious observances, her books, her\r\nneedlework, her plants and flowers, and her share in the management of\r\nthe castle.\r\n\r\nThese domestic tastes she has preserved, and the saying, quoted in\r\nGermany whenever she is the subject of conversation, that her\r\ncharacter and tastes are summed up in the four words _Kaiser, Kinder,\r\nKirche_, and _Küche_--Emperor, children, church, and kitchen--is as\r\ntrue as it is compendious and alliterative. It is often assumed,\r\nespecially by men, that a woman who cultivates these tastes cultivates\r\nno other. This is not as true as is often supposed of the Empress, as\r\na journal of her voyage to Jerusalem in 1898, published on her return\r\nto Germany, goes to show. Following the traditions and example of the\r\nqueens and empresses who have preceded her, she has always given\r\nliberally of her time and care, as she still does, to the most\r\nmultifarious forms of charity. She has a great and intelligible pride\r\nin her clever and energetic husband, while her interest in her\r\nchildren is proverbial. She appears to have no ambition to exercise\r\nany influence on politics or to shine as a leader of society. Like the\r\nEmperor, she is not without a sense of humour, and is always amused by\r\nthe racy Irish stories (in dialect) told her and a little circle of\r\nguests by Dr. Mahaffy, of Trinity College, Dublin, who is a welcome\r\nguest at the palace.\r\n\r\nThe offspring of the marriage, it may be here noted, is a family of\r\nseven children--six sons and a daughter--as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Crown Prince Frederick William, born 1882\r\n     Prince Eitel Frederick             \" 1883\r\n     Prince Adalbert                    \" 1884\r\n     Prince August William              \" 1887\r\n     Prince Oscar                       \" 1888\r\n     Prince Joachim                     \" 1890\r\n     Princess Victoria Louise           \" 1892\r\n\r\nThe Crown Prince was born on June 6th at the Marble Palace in Potsdam.\r\nHe was educated at first privately by tutors, and later at the\r\nmilitary academy at Plön, not far from Kiel. When eighteen he became\r\nof age and began his active career as an officer in the army. He is\r\nnow commander of the First Regiment of Boay Guards (\"Death's Head\"\r\nHussars) at Langfuhr, near Danzig, with the rank of major. He was\r\nmarried in June, 1905, to Cecilie, Duchess of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,\r\nand is the father of four children, all boys. The Crown Princess is\r\none of the cleverest, most popular, and most charming characters in\r\nGermany, of the brightest intelligence and the most unaffected\r\nmanners. The leading trait in the Crown Prince's character is his love\r\nof sport, from big-game shooting (on which he has written a book) to\r\nlawn tennis. In May last he began to learn golf. He is personally\r\namiable, has pleasant manners, and is highly popular with all classes\r\nof his future subjects. He is credited with ability, but is not\r\nbelieved to have inherited the intellectual manysidedness of his\r\nfather. The only part he can be said to have taken in public life as\r\nyet is having called the imperial attention to the Maximilian Harden\r\nallegations regarding Count Eulenburg and a court \"camarilla,\"\r\nreferred to later, and having, while sitting in a gallery of the\r\nReichstag, demonstrated by decidedly marked gestures his disagreement\r\nwith the Government's Morocco policy.\r\n\r\nSince his marriage the Emperor has more than once publicly\r\ncongratulated himself on his good fortune in having such a consort as\r\nthe Empress. The most graceful compliment he paid her was in her own\r\nProvince of Silesia in 1890, when he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The band which unites me with the Province--that of all the\r\n     provinces of the Empire which is nearest to my heart--is the\r\n     jewel which sparkles at my side, Her Majesty the Empress. A\r\n     native of this country, a model of all the virtues of a\r\n     German princess, it is her I have to thank that I am in a\r\n     position joyfully to perform the onerous duties of my\r\n     office.\"\r\n\r\nOnly the other day at Altona, after thirty years of married life, he\r\nreferred to her, again in her home Province and again as she sat\r\nsmiling beside him, as the\r\n\r\n     \"first lady of the land, who is always ready to help the\r\n     needy, to strengthen family ties, to discharge the duties of\r\n     her sex, and suggest to it new aims. The Empress has\r\n     bestowed a home life on the House of Hohenzollern such as\r\n     Queen Louise, alone perhaps, conferred.\"\r\n\r\nQueen Louise, the famous wife of Frederick William III, died in 1810\r\nand is buried in the mausoleum at Charlottenburg, the suburb of\r\nBerlin. She has remained ever since, for the German nation, the type\r\nof womanly perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRE-ACCESSION DAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1881-1887\r\n\r\nThe seven years between the date of his marriage and that of his\r\naccession were chiefly filled in by the future Emperor with the\r\nconscientious discharge of his regimental duties and the preparation\r\nof himself, by three or four hours' study daily at the various\r\nMinistries, among them the Foreign Office, where he sat at the feet of\r\nBismarck, for the imperial tasks he would presumably have to undertake\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nEmperor William I, now a man of eighty-four, was still on the throne.\r\nBorn in 1797, he lived with his parents, Frederick William III and\r\nQueen Louise, in Koenigsberg and Memel for three years after the\r\nbattle of Jena, won the Iron Cross at the age of seventeen in the war\r\nwith Napoleon in 1814, took part in the entry of the Allies into\r\nParis, and devoted himself thenceforward, until he became King of\r\nPrussia in 1861, chiefly to the reorganization of the army. For a year\r\nduring the troubled times of 1848 he was forced to take refuge in\r\nEngland, from whence he returned to live quietly at Coblenz until\r\ncalled to the Regency of Prussia in 1858. He was the Grand Master of\r\nPrussian Freemasonry. The attempts on his life in Berlin in 1878 by\r\nthe anarchists Hödel and Nobiling are still spoken of by eye-witnesses\r\nto them. Both attempts were made within a period of three weeks while\r\nthe King was driving down Unter den Linden, and on both occasions\r\nrevolver shots were fired at him. Hödel's attempt failed, but in view\r\nof Socialist agitation, the would-be assassin was beheaded (the\r\npractice still in Prussia) a few weeks later. Pellets from Nobiling's\r\nweapon struck the King in the face and arm, and disabled him from work\r\nfor several weeks. The political events of the reign, including the\r\nSeven Weeks' War with Austria in 1866, which ended at Sadowa, where\r\nKing William was in chief command, and that with France in 1870, when\r\nhe was present as Commander-in-Chief at Gravelotte and Sedan, are\r\nfrequently referred to by Bismarck in his \"Gedanke und Erinnerungen,\"\r\nand to these the reader may be referred.\r\n\r\nThe high and amiable character of the old Emperor, as he became after\r\n1870, is common knowledge. He was a thoroughgoing Hohenzollern in his\r\nviews of monarchy and his relations to his folk, but he was at the\r\nsame time the type of German chivalry, the essence of good nature, the\r\nsoul of honour, and the slave of duty. He was extremely fond of his\r\ngrandson, Prince William, and it is clear from the latter's speeches\r\nsubsequently that the affection was ardently reciprocated.\r\n\r\nOf Emperor William, Bismarck writes in the highest terms, describing\r\nhis \"kingly courtesy,\" his freedom from vanity, his impartiality\r\ntowards friend and foe alike; in a word, he says, Emperor William was\r\nthe idea \"gentleman\" incorporated. On the other hand, Bismarck tells\r\nhow the old Emperor all his life long stood in awe of his consort, the\r\nEmpress Augusta, Bismarck's great enemy and the clearing-house\r\n(_Krystallisationspunkt_), as he describes her, of all the opposition\r\nagainst him; and how the Emperor used to speak of her as \"the\r\nhot-head\" (\"_Feuerkopf_\")--\"a capital name for her,\" Bismarck adds,\r\n\"as she could not bear her authority as Queen to be overborne by that\r\nof anyone else.\" The Iron Chancellor, by the way, mentions a curious\r\nfact in connexion with the attempt on Emperor William's life by\r\nNobiling. The Chancellor says he had noticed that in the seventies the\r\nEmperor's powers had begun to fail, and that he often lost the thread\r\nof a conversation, both in hearing and speaking. After the Nobiling\r\nattempt this disability, strangely enough, completely disappeared. The\r\nfact was noticed by the Emperor himself, for one day he said jestingly\r\nto Bismarck: \"Nobiling knew better than the doctors what I really\r\nneeded--a good blood-letting.\"\r\n\r\nReferring to the Empress Frederick at this period, Bismarck writes:\r\n\r\n     \"With her I could not reckon on the same good-will as I\r\n     could with her husband (Emperor Frederick). Her natural and\r\n     inborn sympathy for her native country showed itself from\r\n     the very beginning in the endeavour to shift the weight of\r\n     Prussian-German influence on the European grouping of the\r\n     Powers into the scale of England, which she never ceased to\r\n     regard as her Fatherland; and, in consciousness of the\r\n     opposition of interests between the two great Asiatic\r\n     Powers, England and Russia, to see Germany's power, in case\r\n     of a breach, used for the benefit of England.\"\r\n\r\nAn incident may be mentioned here which took place at what was to turn\r\nout to be the Emperor William's death-bed and refers particularly to\r\nour young Prince William. Bismarck was talking to the sick Emperor a\r\nfew days before the latter's death. The Chancellor spoke about the\r\nnecessity of publishing an Order, already drawn up in November of the\r\npreceding year, appointing Prince William regent in case the necessity\r\nfor such a measure should occur. The sick Emperor expressed the hope\r\nthat Bismarck would stand by his successor. Bismarck promised to do so\r\nand the Emperor pressed his hand in token of satisfaction. Then,\r\nsuddenly, Bismarck relates, the Emperor became delirious and began to\r\nrave. Prince William was the central figure in his ravings. He\r\nevidently thought his grandson was at his bedside and exclaimed, using\r\nthe familiar _Du_; \"_Du_ you must always keep on good terms with the\r\nCzar (Alexander III) ... there is no need to quarrel in that quarter.\"\r\nThereafter he was silent, and Bismarck left the sick-room.\r\n\r\nThe Prince's parents, Crown Prince Frederick and his English consort,\r\nhad also their Court at the Marmor Palais in Potsdam, and their palace\r\nin Berlin, but the life they led was comparatively simple. The Crown\r\nPrince and Princess were great travellers and consequently often\r\nabsent from Germany; and when at home, while the Crown Prince, in his\r\nserious-minded fashion, was absorbed in study, the Crown Princess\r\ndivided her time between the practice of the arts and correspondence\r\nwith her now grown-up sons and daughters.\r\n\r\nStill, it is clear from the signs of the time that there was a good\r\ndeal of intrigue going on throughout this pre-accession period, or, if\r\nintrigue is too strong a term for it, a good deal of friction, social\r\nand political, in high circles. It was chiefly caused, if the old\r\nChancellor's statements to his sycophantic adorer, Busch, are to be\r\ncredited, by the interference of the Empress Augusta and her\r\ndaughter-in-law, the Crown Princess, in the sphere of politics, the\r\nEmpress seeking to influence her husband in favour of the Catholics,\r\nwhom she had taken under her protection, and the Crown Princess\r\ntrying, as we have seen, to influence German policy in favour of\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nExactly what part Prince William took in it all is not very clear. One\r\nthing we know, that he greatly displeased Bismarck by his constant\r\nattendance at the Waldersee _salon_, then a social centre in Berlin.\r\nCountess Waldersee, who is still living in Hannover, was the daughter\r\nof an American banker named Lee. She married Frederick, Prince of\r\nSchleswig, but he died six months after the wedding. His widow\r\nafterwards married Count Waldersee, who was subsequently to command\r\nthe international forces during the Boxer troubles in China. Bismarck\r\ndetested Waldersee, perhaps because many people spoke of him as his\r\nprobable successor, and consequently looked with anything but favour\r\non his imperial pupil's visit to the Waldersees.\r\n\r\nThe great figure of the time, however, was neither the Emperor nor the\r\nCrown Prince nor Prince William, but Prince Bismarck, who, as\r\nChancellor for now more than a quarter of a century, had throughout\r\nthat period guided the destinies of Prussia and the German Empire.\r\nEmperor William and Crown Prince Frederick and Prince William were\r\nplaying, doubtless, more or less prominent parts on the public stage,\r\nbut all things of moment gravitated towards Bismarck, whose days were\r\nspent, now persuading or convincing the Emperor, now warring with a\r\nParliament growing impatient of his dictatorial attitude, now\r\ncountermining the intrigues and opposition of his adversaries at Court\r\nand in the Ministries. He hardly ever went into society, but though he\r\nspent his days growling in his den at the Foreign Office when he was\r\nnot immersed in work, he was the great popular figure of Berlin;\r\nindeed, it might be said, of all Germany.\r\n\r\nAs second lieutenant, Prince William had naturally a good deal to\r\nlearn, though, entering life, as we have seen, as a \"fine young\r\nrecruit,\" having had a \"military governor\" appointed to his service\r\nwhen he was four, being made an officer at the age of ten, and having\r\npassed most of his life hitherto in a military society and atmosphere,\r\nhe had less perhaps to learn than the ordinary young German officer.\r\nHe went through the usual drills, and doubtless felt, as keenly as\r\ndoes the young officer everywhere, their monotonous and seemingly\r\nunnecessary repetitions, but they fulfilled the object in view and\r\ngave him the well-set-up bearing and martial tread which still\r\ndistinguish him. Living in the old Town Castle of Potsdam, in rooms\r\nthat had once been occupied by Frederick the Great, he entered with\r\nzest into the task of learning the mechanism of his regiment and at\r\nthe same time of the army generally, though it cannot have been as\r\ninteresting a task then as now, when science has added so many new\r\nbranches to military organization. Both he and his young wife were as\r\nhospitable as their not too generous means and occasional cheques from\r\nthe Emperor William would allow, particularly to any Borussian of the\r\nPrince's Bonn university days who might be passing through Berlin or\r\nPotsdam. The young Prince and Princess took part, as was to be\r\nexpected of them, in the festivities and ceremonies of the Emperor's\r\nand Crown Prince's Court, and, when they had nothing more interesting\r\nto do, might be seen strolling arm in arm about the streets in Potsdam\r\nlooking into the shops as young married people do in every town, and\r\nbeing apparently, as the story-books say, as happy as the day is long.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, however, during these pre-accession years, only glimpses\r\nof Prince William's character and doings are obtainable, but, though\r\nmeagre, they are sufficient to suggest that in his case, too, if we\r\nextend the saying to cover the entire period of youth, the child was\r\nfather to the man. The chief, almost the only, reliable authorities\r\nfor the inner history of the time are the memoirs and notes left by\r\nthe two Chancellors, Prince Bismarck and Prince Hohenlohe--_en\r\npassant_ let the hope be expressed here that in the interests of\r\nGermany herself another Chancellor, Prince Bernhard Ernst von Bülow,\r\nnow living in retirement at Rome, will enlighten the world as to that\r\nof the last ten or twelve stirring years, _quorum pars magna fuit_.\r\nBoth Bismarck and Hohenlohe were excellent judges of character, and\r\nhave, described, though with regrettable brevity, the character of\r\nPrince William about this time. Talking to his confidant, Dr. Busch,\r\nin June, 1882, Bismarck says of the Prince:\r\n\r\n     \"He is quite different from the Emperor William, and wishes\r\n     to take the government into his own hands; he is energetic\r\n     and determined, not at all disposed to put up with\r\n     parliamentary co-regents, a regular guardsman; Philopater\r\n     and Antipater at Potsdam! He is not at all pleased at his\r\n     father (Crown Prince Frederick) taking up with professors,\r\n     with Mommsen, Virchow, Forckenbeck. Perhaps he may one day\r\n     develop into the _rocher de bronze_ of which we stand in\r\n     need.\"\r\n\r\nThis _rocher de bronze_ is an expression constantly employed by\r\ndevoted royalists and imperialists in Germany. It was first used by\r\nFrederick William IV, who, in the jargon which in his time passed for\r\nthe German language, exclaimed: \"_Ich werde meine Souvereinetat\r\nstabilizieren wie ein rocher de bronze_.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, about this time Bismarck says:\r\n\r\n     \"Up to that time (when Prince William was studying at the\r\n     Ministries) he knew little, and indeed did not trouble\r\n     himself much about it, but preferred to enjoy himself in the\r\n     society of young officers and such-like,\"\r\n\r\nand he goes on to tell how the Prince took--or did not take--to this\r\nMinisterial education. It was proposed that the Under Secretary of\r\nState, Herrfurth, who was reputed to be well informed, particularly in\r\nstatistics, should instruct him about internal questions. The Prince\r\nagreed and invited Herrfurth to lunch, but afterwards told Bismarck he\r\ncould not stand him, \"with his bristly beard, his dryness and\r\ntediousness.\" Could Bismarck suggest some one else? The Chancellor\r\nmentioned Privy Councillor von Brandenstein. The Prince did not\r\nobject, had the Baron several times to meals, but paid so little\r\nattention to his explanations that Brandenstein lost patience and\r\nbegged for some other employment. Concerning a rendezvous, Bismarck\r\nwrites:\r\n\r\n     \"He (Prince William) has more understanding, more courage\r\n     and greater independence (than his grandfather), but in his\r\n     leaning for me he goes too far. He was 'surprised' that I\r\n     had waited for him, a thing his grandfather was incapable of\r\n     saying;\"\r\n\r\nand the Chancellor adds:\r\n\r\n     \"It is only in trifles and matters of secondary importance\r\n     that one occasionally has reason to find fault with him, as,\r\n     for instance, in the form of his State declarations--but\r\n     that is youthful vivacity which time will correct. Better\r\n     too much than too little fire.\"\r\n\r\nBusch relates, under date of April 6, 1888, Bismarck's birthday, how\r\nPrince William came to offer his congratulations, and, having done so,\r\ninvited himself to dinner. The meal over, he made a speech toasting\r\nBismarck, in which he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The Empire is like an army corps that has lost its\r\n     commander-in-chief in the field, while the officer who is\r\n     next to him in rank lies severely wounded. At this critical\r\n     moment forty-six million loyal German hearts turn with\r\n     solicitude and hope to the standard, and the standard-bearer\r\n     in whom all their expectations are centred. The\r\n     standard-bearer is our illustrious Prince, our great\r\n     Chancellor. Let him lead us. We will follow him. Long may he\r\n     live!\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe's references to Prince William as Emperor are\r\nfrequent and full, but he has little to say about his character as\r\nPrince William beyond noting, when there was some talk of the Prince\r\ndirectly succeeding Emperor William, that he was \"too young.\" On an\r\noccasion subsequently Prince Hohenlohe amusingly notes that the\r\nEmperor shook hands with him until his fingers \"nearly cracked.\" This\r\nis still a genial gesture of the Emperor's.\r\n\r\nOne document, however, is available to show the spirit of religious\r\ntolerance which then animated our young Lutheran Prince, as it has\r\nanimated him, it may be added, ever since. Pius IX had been succeeded\r\nin the Papacy by the more liberal Leo XIII, and the Kulturkampf had\r\ncome to an end. Prince William, writing to an uncle, Cardinal\r\nHohenlohe, says:--\r\n\r\n     \"That this unholy Kulturkampf is at an end is a thing which\r\n     rejoices me beyond expression. Of late many eminent\r\n     Catholics, among them Kopp (afterwards Cardinal) have\r\n     frequently visited me and honoured me with a confidence at\r\n     once complete and gratifying. I was often so happy as to be\r\n     able to be the interpreter of their wishes (to the Emperor\r\n     and Bismarck, presumably) and do them some service. So it\r\n     has been granted to my youth to co-operate in this work of\r\n     peace. This has given me great pleasure and happiness.\r\n\r\n     \"Give my regards to Galimberti and lay my respects at the\r\n     feet of the Pope.\r\n\r\n     \"Thy devoted nephew,\r\n\r\n     \"WILLIAM OF PRUSSIA.\"\r\n\r\nWith his future subjects Prince William was brought into close\r\nrelations only in a very limited way. No one, save perhaps Bismarck,\r\nseems to have known or suspected his true character and aims. This was\r\nnatural enough, since it is not until a man comes to occupy some\r\ninfluential or prominent position that the public begins to take an\r\ninterest in him. His father would be Emperor before him, and fate\r\nmight have it that he himself would not live to come to the throne.\r\nRoyal highnesses are not uncommon in a country with such a feudal\r\nhistory and so many courts as Germany. The young Prince, moreover, was\r\nnever, to use a phrase of to-day, in the limelight. He was never\r\ninvolved in a notorious scandal. He had not, as his eldest son, the\r\npresent Crown Prince, has, published a book. He was more or less\r\nabsorbed in the army, the early grave of so many dawning talents. And\r\nthere was no newspaper press devoted to chronicling the doings and\r\nsayings of the fashionable world of his time. His natural abilities\r\nwould doubtless have secured him reputation and success in any sphere\r\nof life, but, as he himself would probably be the first to admit, much\r\nof his fame, and even much of his merit, is due to the splendid\r\nopportunities afforded him by his birth and position.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is obvious that if his people at this period had\r\nnot much opportunity of studying the young Prince, he had been\r\nstudying them and their requirements as these latter appeared to him.\r\nHe had evidently thought much on Germany's conditions and prospects\r\nbefore he came to the throne, and was Empire-building in imagination\r\nlong before he became Emperor. It is not hard to guess the drift of\r\nhis meditations. The success of the Empire depended on the success of\r\nPrussia, and the success of Prussia, ringed in by possibly hostile\r\nPowers, on union under a Prussian King whom Germans should swear\r\nfealty to and regard as a Heaven-granted leader. From the history of\r\nPrussia he drew the conclusion that force, physical force, well\r\norganized and equipped, must be the basis of Germany's security.\r\nPhysical force had made Brandenburg into Prussia, and Prussia into the\r\nstill nascent modern German Empire. He knew that France was only\r\nwaiting for the day to come when she would be powerful enough to\r\nrecover her lost provinces. Russia was friendly, but there was no\r\ncertainty she would always be so. Austria was an ally, but many people\r\nin Austria had not forgotten Sadowa, and in any case her military and\r\nnaval forces were far from being efficient. An irresistible army, and\r\na national spirit that would keep it so, were consequently Germany's\r\nfirst essentials.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously a new fact of vital importance for Germany's prosperity\r\npresented itself for consideration--the growth of world-policy in\r\ntrade, the expansion of commerce through the development caused by new\r\nconditions of transport and intercommunication in which other nations\r\nwere already engaged. The Prince saw his country's merchants beginning\r\nto spread over the earth, and believing in the doctrine that trade\r\nfollows the flag, he felt that the flag, with the power and protection\r\nit affords, must be supplied. For this it appeared to him that a navy\r\nwas as indispensable as was an efficient army for Germany's internal\r\nsecurity. All other great countries had fine navies, while to Germany\r\nthis complement of Empire was practically wanting. Accordingly he now\r\ntook up the study of naval science and naval construction.\r\n\r\nThere was an occasion, however, at this time when the young Prince\r\nattracted general attention, if only for a few days. It was when as\r\ncolonel of the Body Guard Hussars, he ordered his officers to withdraw\r\nfrom a Berlin club in which hazard and high play had ruined some of\r\nthe younger and less wealthy members. The committee of the club used\r\ntheir influence to cause Emperor William to make the new commander\r\ncancel his order. The Emperor sent for his grandson and requested its\r\nwithdrawal.\r\n\r\n\"Majesty,\" said the young commander, \"permit me a question--am I still\r\ncommander of the regiment?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course--\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, will your Majesty allow me to maintain the order--or else\r\naccept my resignation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said the Emperor, who was in reality pleased with the young\r\ndisciplinarian, \"there can be no talk of such a thing. I could not\r\nfind so good a commanding officer again in a hurry.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the club committee's ambassadors came to the Emperor to learn the\r\nresult of his intervention, his answer was, \"Very sorry, gentlemen; I\r\ndid my best, but the colonel refuses.\"\r\n\r\nThe political situation as regards France was just now highly\r\nprecarious. General Boulanger, whom Gambetta once described as \"one of\r\nthe four best officers in France,\" had become Minister of War in the\r\nde Freycinet Cabinet of 1886. Relying on a supposed superiority of the\r\nFrench army, he prepared for a war of revenge against Germany and\r\naimed, with the help of Deroulède and Rochfort, at suppressing the\r\nparliamentary _régime_ and establishing himself as dictator. His plans\r\nwere answered in Germany by the acceptance of Bismarck's Septennat\r\nproposals for increasing the army and fixing its budget for seven\r\nyears in advance. The war feeling in France diminished, and though it\r\nrevived for a time owing to the arrest of the French frontier police\r\ncommissary Schnaebele, it finally died out on that officer's release\r\nat the particular request of the Czar to Emperor William. Boulanger's\r\nsubsequent history only concerns France. He was sent to a provincial\r\ncommand, but returned to Paris, where he was joyously received and\r\nelected to Parliament by a large majority. He might, it is believed, a\r\nyear or two later, on being elected by the department of the Seine,\r\nwith Paris at his back, have made a successful _coup d'état_ on the\r\nnight of his triumphant election, but his courage at the last moment\r\nfailed, and on learning that he was about to be arrested he fled to\r\nBrussels, where he committed suicide on the grave of his mistress.\r\n\r\nThe time, however, was approaching, the most interesting, and as the\r\nsuccession of events have shown, the most momentous for the Empire\r\nsince 1870, when Prince William's accession was obviously at hand.\r\nDuring the year 1887 and the early part of 1888 the attention of the\r\nworld was fixed, first curiously, then anxiously, then sympathetically\r\non the situation in Berlin. Emperor William was an old man just turned\r\nninety; he was fast breaking up and any week his death might be\r\nannounced. Hereditarily the Crown Prince Frederick, now fifty-six,\r\nshould succeed, and a new reign would open which might introduce\r\npolitical changes of moment to other countries as well as Germany. The\r\nnew reign was indeed to open, but only to prove one of the shortest in\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1887, a Shadow fell on the House of Hohenzollern, the\r\nShadow that must one day fall on every living creature. It was noticed\r\nthat the Crown Prince was hoarse, had caught a cold, or something of\r\nthe kind. A stay at Ems did him no good, Doctors Tobold and von\r\nBergmann, the leading specialists of the day, were consulted, a\r\nlaryngoscopic examination followed, the presence of cancer was\r\nstrongly suspected, and an operation was advised. At this juncture, at\r\nthe suggestion, it is said, of Queen Victoria, it was decided to\r\nsummon the specialist of highest reputation in England, Sir Morell\r\nMackenzie, who, having examined the patient, and basing his opinion on\r\na report of Professor Virchow's, declared that the growth was not\r\nmalignant. It was now May, and on Mackenzie's advice the patient\r\nvisited England, where, accompanied by Prince William, he was present\r\nat the celebration of Queen Victoria's Jubilee. Some months after his\r\nreturn to the Continent were spent with his family in Tirol and Italy,\r\nuntil November found him in San Remo, where a meeting of famous\r\nsurgeons from Vienna, Berlin, and Frankfort-on-Main finally diagnosed\r\nthe existence of cancer, and Mackenzie coincided with the judgment.\r\n\r\nThe old Emperor died on March 9th. He had taken cold on March 3rd, and\r\non the 7th a chronic ailment of the kidneys from which he suffered\r\nbecame worse, he could not sleep, his strength began to ebb, and it\r\nwas clear the end was near. On the 6th, however, he was able to speak\r\nfor a few minutes with Prince William, with Bismarck, and with his\r\nonly daughter, the Grand Duchess of Baden, who had arrived post-haste\r\nthe night before to be present at the death-bed. The Grand Duchess, as\r\nthe Emperor spoke, besought him not to tire himself by talking. \"I\r\nhave no time to be tired,\" he murmured, in a flicker of the sense of\r\nduty which had been a lifelong feature of his character, and a few\r\nhours later he passed quietly away. The funeral, headed by Prince\r\nWilliam and the Knights of the Black Eagle, took place on the 20th.\r\nThe new Emperor Frederick, who had hurried from San Remo on receiving\r\nnews of the Emperor's condition, was too ill to join it, but stood\r\nbehind a closed window of his palace and saluted as the coffin went\r\nby.\r\n\r\nThe incidents of the Emperor Frederick's ascent of the throne, the\r\namnesty and liberal-minded proclamations to his people, and in\r\nparticular the heroic resignation with which he bore his fate, are\r\nevents of common knowledge. One of them was the so-called Battenberg\r\naffair. Queen Victoria desired a marriage between Princess Victoria,\r\nthe present Emperor's sister, then aged twenty-two, and Prince\r\nAlexander of Battenberg, at that time Prince of Bulgaria, so as to\r\nsecure him against Russia by an alliance with the imperial house of\r\nGermany. Prince Bismarck objected on the ground that the marriage\r\nwould show Germany in an unfriendly light at St. Petersburg, and might\r\nsubject a Prussian princess to the risk of expulsion from Sofia.\r\nAnother account is that the Chancellor feared an increase of English\r\ninfluence at the German Court with the Prince of Bulgaria as its\r\nchannel. In any case, the result of the Chancellor's opposition was to\r\nplace the sick Emperor in a delicate and painful situation. It was\r\nended by his yielding to the Chancellor's representations, and the\r\nmarriage did not come off.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Emperor's malady was making fatal progress. The Shadow\r\nwas growing darker and more formidable. A season of patiently-borne\r\nsuffering followed, until Death in his terrific majesty appeared and\r\nanother Emperor occupied the throne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"VON GOTTES GNADEN\"\r\n\r\nPrince William is now German Emperor and King of Prussia. Before\r\nobserving him as trustee and manager of his magnificent inheritance a\r\npause may be made to investigate the true meaning of a much-discussed\r\nphrase which, while suggesting nothing to the Englishman though he\r\nwill find it stamped in the words \"Dei gratia\" on every shilling piece\r\nthat passes through his hands, is the bed-rock and foundation of the\r\nEmperor's system of rule and the key to his nature and conduct.\r\n\r\nGovernment in Germany is dynastic, not, as in England and America,\r\nparliamentary or democratic. The King of Prussia possesses his\r\ncrown--such is the theory of the people as well as of the dynasty--by\r\nthe grace of God, not by the consent of the people. The same may be\r\nsaid of the German Emperor, who fills his office as King of Prussia.\r\nTo the Anglo-Saxon foreigner the dynasty in Germany, and particularly\r\nin Prussia, appears a sort of fetish, the worship of which begins in\r\nthe public schools with lessons on the heroic deeds of the\r\nHohenzollerns, and with the Emperor, as high priest, constantly\r\ncalling on his people to worship with him. This view of the kingly\r\nsuccession may seem Oriental, but it is not surprising when one\r\nreflects that the Hohenzollern dynasty is over a thousand years old\r\nand during that time has ruled successively in part of Southern\r\nGermany, in Brandenburg, in Prussia, until at last, imperially, in all\r\nGermany. Moreover, it has ruled wisely on the whole; in the course of\r\ncenturies it has brought a poor and disunited people, living on a soil\r\nto a great extent barren and sandy, to a pitch of power and prosperity\r\nwhich is exciting the envy and apprehension of other nations.\r\n\r\nIn England government passed centuries ago from the dynasty to the\r\npeople, and there are people in England to-day who could not name the\r\ndynasty that occupies the English throne. Such ignorance in Germany is\r\nhardly conceivable. In Prussia government has always been the appanage\r\nof the Hohenzollerns, and the Emperor is resolved that, supported by\r\nthe army, it shall continue to be their appanage in the Empire.\r\nGovernment means guidance, and no one is more conscious of the fact\r\nthan the Emperor, for he is trying to guide his people all the time.\r\nFrederick William IV once said to the Diet: \"You are here to represent\r\nrights, the rights of your class and, at the same time, the rights of\r\nthe throne: to represent opinion is not your task.\" This relation of\r\ngovernment and people has become modified of recent years to a very\r\nobvious degree, but constitutionally not a step has been taken in the\r\ndirection of popular, that is to say parliamentary, rule.\r\n\r\nEngland and Germany are both constitutional monarchies, but both the\r\nmonarch and the Constitution in Germany are different from the monarch\r\nand the Constitution in England. The British Constitution is a growth\r\nof centuries, not, like the German Constitution, the creation of a\r\nday. The British Constitution is unwritten, if it is stamped, as Mary\r\nsaid the word \"Calais\" would be found stamped on her heart after\r\ndeath, on the heart and brain of every Englishman. The German\r\nConstitution is a written document in seventy-eight chapters, not\r\nfifty years old, and on which, compared with the British Constitution,\r\nthe ink is not yet dry. In England to the people the Constitution is\r\nthe real monarch: in Germany the monarchy is to the people what the\r\nBritish Constitution is to the Englishman; and while in England the\r\nmonarch is the first counsellor to the Constitution, in Germany the\r\nConstitution is the first counsellor to the monarch.\r\n\r\nThe consequence in England is representative government, with a\r\npolitical career for every ordinary citizen; the consequence in\r\nGermany is constitutional monarchy, properly so-called, with a\r\npolitical career for no common citizen. Neither system is perfect, but\r\nboth, apparently, give admirable national results. And yet, of course,\r\nan Englishman cannot help thinking that if Herr Bebel were made\r\nMinister to-morrow, Social Democracy would cease to exist.\r\n\r\nThe people acquiesce in the Hohenzollern view, not indeed with perfect\r\nand entire unanimity, for the small Progressive party demand a\r\nparliamentary form of government, if not on the exact model of that\r\nestablished in England. The Social Democrats, evidently, would have no\r\ngovernment at all. Many English people suppose that Germans generally\r\nmust desire parliamentary rule and would help them to get it, for\r\nmultitudes of English people are firmly persuaded that it is England's\r\nmission to extend to other peoples the institutions which have suited\r\nher so well, without sufficiently considering how different are their\r\ncircumstances, geographical position, history, traditions, and\r\nnational character. A very similar mistake is made in Germany by\r\nmultitudes of Germans, who believe it is Germany's mission to impose\r\nher culture, her views of man and life, on the rest of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Prussian view of monarchy, expressed in the words \"von Gottes\r\nGnaden\" (\"By the Grace of God\"), is a political conception, which,\r\nunder its customary English translation, \"by Divine Right,\" has often\r\nbeen ridiculed by English writers. Lord Macaulay, it will be\r\nremembered, in his \"History of England,\" asserts that the doctrine\r\nfirst emerged into notice when James the Sixth of Scotland ascended\r\nthe English throne. \"It was gravely maintained,\" writes Macaulay,\r\n\r\n     \"that the Supreme Being regarded hereditary monarchy, as\r\n     opposed to other systems of government, with peculiar\r\n     favour; that the rule of succession in order of\r\n     primogeniture was a divine institution anterior to the\r\n     Christian, and even to the Mosaic, dispensation; that no\r\n     human power, not even that of the whole legislature, no\r\n     length of adverse possession, though it extended to ten\r\n     centuries, could deprive the legitimate prince of his\r\n     rights; that his authority was necessarily always despotic;\r\n     that the laws by which, in England and other countries, the\r\n     prerogative was limited, were to be regarded merely as\r\n     concessions which the sovereign had freely made and might at\r\n     his pleasure resume; and that any treaty into which a king\r\n     might enter with his people was merely a declaration of his\r\n     present intention, and not a contract of which the\r\n     performance could be demanded.\"\r\n\r\nThe statement exactly expresses the ideas on the subject attributed\r\nabroad to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe distinguished German historian, Heinrich von Treitschke, writes of\r\nKing Frederick William IV, the predecessor of Emperor William I, as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"He believed in a mysterious enlightenment which is granted\r\n     'von Gottes Gnaden' to kings rather than other mortals. All\r\n     the blessings of peace, which his People could expect under\r\n     a Christian monarch, should Proceed from the wisdom of the\r\n     Crown alone; he regarded his high office like a patriarch of\r\n     the Old Testament and held the kingship as a fatherly power\r\n     established by God Himself for the education of the people.\r\n     Whatever happened in the State he connected with the person\r\n     of the monarch. If only his age and its royal awakener had\r\n     understood each other better! He had, however, in his\r\n     strangely complicated process of development, constructed\r\n     such extraordinary ideals that though he might sometimes\r\n     agree in words with his contemporaries he never did as to\r\n     the things, and spoke a different language from his people.\r\n     Even General Gerlach, his good friend and servant, used to\r\n     say: 'The ways of the King are wonderful;' and the not less\r\n     loyal Bunsen wrote about a complaint of the monarch that 'no\r\n     one understands me, no one agrees with me,' the\r\n     commentary--'When one understood him, how could one agree\r\n     with him?'\"\r\n\r\nIt was this king, be it parenthetically remarked, who said, when his\r\npeople were clamouring for a Constitution, in 1847: \"Now and never\r\nwill I admit that a written paper, like a second Providence, force\r\nitself between our God in Heaven and this land\"--and a few months\r\nlater had to sign the document his people demanded.\r\n\r\nVon Treitschke, writing on the last birthday of Emperor William I,\r\nthus spoke of the doctrine:\r\n\r\n     \"A generation ago an attempt was made by a theologizing\r\n     State theory to inculcate the doctrine of a power of the\r\n     throne, divine, released from all earthly obligations. This\r\n     mystery of the Jacobins never found entrance into the clear\r\n     common sense of our people.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck's view of the doctrine was explained in a speech he\r\nmade to the Prussian Diet in 1847. He was speaking on \"Prussia as a\r\nChristian State.\" \"For me,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"the words 'von Gottes Gnaden,' which Christian rulers join\r\n     to their names, are no empty phrase, but I see in them the\r\n     recognition that the princes desire to wield the sceptre\r\n     which God has assigned them according to the will of God on\r\n     earth. As God's will I can, however, only recognize what is\r\n     revealed in the Christian gospels, and I believe I am in my\r\n     right when I call that State a Christian one which has taken\r\n     as its task the realization, the putting into operation, of\r\n     the Christian doctrine.... Assuming generally that the State\r\n     has a religious foundation, in my opinion this foundation\r\n     can only be Christianity. Take away this religious\r\n     foundation from the State and we retain nothing of the State\r\n     but a chance aggregation of rights, a kind of bulwark\r\n     against the war of all against all, which the old\r\n     philosophers spoke of.\"\r\n\r\nOn the second occasion, thirty years later, the Chancellor's theme was\r\n\"Obedience to God and the King.\"\r\n\r\n\"I refer,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"to the wrong interpretation of a sentence which in itself\r\n     is right--namely, that one must obey God rather than man.\r\n     The previous speaker must know me long enough to be aware\r\n     that I subscribe to the entire correctness of this sentence,\r\n     and that I believe I obey God when I serve the King under\r\n     the device 'With God for King and Country.' Now he (the\r\n     previous speaker) has separated the component parts of the\r\n     device, for he sees God separated from King and Fatherland.\r\n     I cannot follow him on this road. I believe I serve my God\r\n     when I serve my King in the protection of the commonwealth\r\n     whose monarch 'von Gottes Gnaden' he is, and on whom the\r\n     emancipation from alien spiritual influence and the\r\n     independence of his people from Romish pressure have been\r\n     laid by God as a duty in which I serve the King. The\r\n     previous speaker would certainly admit in private that we do\r\n     not believe in the divinity of a State idol, though he seems\r\n     to assert here that we believe in it.\"\r\n\r\nIn these passages, it may be remarked, Bismarck avoids an\r\nunconditional endorsement of the Hohenzollern doctrine of divine\r\n\"right\" or even divine appointment. Indeed all he does is to express\r\nhis belief in the sincerity of rulers who declare their desire to rule\r\nin accordance with the will of God as it appears in Holy Scripture. In\r\naddition to his dislike of a \"Christianity above the State,\" the fact\r\nthat he did not subscribe to the doctrine of divine right, as these\r\nwords are interpreted in England, is shown by another speech in which\r\nhe said, \"The essence of the constitutional monarchy under which we\r\nlive is the co-operation of the monarchical will and the convictions\r\nof the people.\" But what, one is tempted to ask, if will and\r\nconvictions differ?\r\n\r\nIn recent times, Dr. Paul Liman, in an excellent character sketch of\r\nthe Emperor, devotes his first chapter to the subject, thus\r\nrecognizing the important place it occupies in the Emperor's\r\nmentality. Dr. Liman, like all German writers who have dealt with the\r\ntopic, animadverts on the Hohenzollern obsession by the theory and\r\nattributes it chiefly to the romantic side of the Emperor's nature\r\nwhich was strongly influenced in youth by the \"wonderful events\" of\r\n1870, by the national outburst of thanks to God at the time, and by\r\nthe return from victorious war of his father, his grandfather, and\r\nother heroes, as they must have appeared to him, like Bismarck,\r\nMoltke, and Roon.\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting that Prince von Bülow, during the ten years of his\r\nChancellorship, made no parliamentary or other specific and public\r\nallusion to the doctrine.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, attempting to offer a somewhat different explanation\r\nof the Emperor's attitude in the matter from those just cited, let us\r\nsee what statements he has himself made publicly about it and how the\r\ndoctrine has been interpreted by his contemporaries. He made no\r\nreference to it in his declarations to the army, the navy, and the\r\npeople when he ascended the throne. His first allusion to it was in\r\nMarch, 1890, at the annual meeting of the Brandenburg provincial Diet\r\nat the Kaiserhof Hotel in Berlin, and then the allusion was not\r\nexplicit. \"I see,\" said the Emperor,\r\n\r\n     \"in the folk and land which have descended to me a talent\r\n     entrusted to me by God, which it is my task to increase, and\r\n     I intend with all my power so to administer this talent that\r\n     I hope to be able to add much to it. Those who are willing\r\n     to help me I heartily welcome whoever they may be: those who\r\n     oppose me in this task I will crush.\"\r\n\r\nHis next allusion, at Bremen in April of the same year, when he was\r\nlaying the foundation-stone of a statue to his grandfather, King\r\nWilliam, a few months subsequent to Bismarck's retirement, was more\r\nexplicit, yet not completely so.\r\n\r\n\"It is a tradition of our House,\" so ran his speech,\r\n\r\n     \"that we, the Hohenzollerns, regard ourselves as appointed\r\n     by God to govern and to lead the people, whom it is given us\r\n     to rule, for their well-being and the advancement of their\r\n     material and intellectual interests.\"\r\n\r\nThe next reference, and the only one in which a divine \"right\" to rule\r\nin Prussia is formally claimed, occurs four years later at\r\nKoenigsberg, the ancient crowning-place of Prussian kings. Here he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     \"The successor (namely himself) of him who _of his own\r\n     right_ was sovereign prince in Prussia will follow the same\r\n     path as his great ancestor; as formerly the first King (of\r\n     Prussia, Frederick I.) said, 'My crown is born with me,' and\r\n     as his greater son (the Great Elector) gave his authority\r\n     the stability of a rock of bronze, so I too, like my\r\n     imperial grandfather, represent the kingship 'von Gottes\r\n     Gnaden.'\"\r\n\r\nAt Coblenz in 1897, in reference to the first Emperor William's\r\nlabours for the army and people:--\r\n\r\n     \"He (Emperor William) left Coblenz to ascend the throne as\r\n     the selected instrument of the Lord he always regarded\r\n     himself to be. For us all, and above all for us princes, he\r\n     raised once more aloft and lent lustrous beams to a jewel\r\n     which we should hold high and holy--that is the kingship von\r\n     Gottes Gnaden, the kingship with its onerous duties, its\r\n     never-ending, ever-continuing trouble and labour, with its\r\n     fearful responsibility to the Creator alone, from which no\r\n     human being, no minister, no parliament, no people can\r\n     release the prince.\"\r\n\r\nHere, too, if the words \"responsibility to the Creator alone\" be taken\r\nin their ordinary English sense, the allusion to a divine right may be\r\nconstrued, though it is observable that the word \"right\" is not\r\nactually employed.\r\n\r\nIn Berlin, when unveiling a monument to the Great Elector, the Emperor\r\nwas filled with the same idea of the God-given mission of the\r\nHohenzollerns. After briefly sketching the deeds of the Elector--how\r\nhe came young to the throne to find crops down-trodden, villages burnt\r\nto the ground, a starved and fallen people, persecuted on every side,\r\nhis country the arena for barbarous robber-bands who had spread war\r\nand devastation throughout Germany for thirty years; how, with\r\n\"invincible reliance on God\" and an iron will, he swept the pieces of\r\nthe land together, raised trade and commerce, agriculture and\r\nindustry, in for that period an incredibly short time; how he brought\r\ninto existence a new army entirely devoted to him; how, in fine,\r\nguided by the hope of founding a great northern Empire, which would\r\nbring the German peoples together, he became an authority in Europe\r\nand laid the corner-stone of the present Empire--after sketching all\r\nthis, the Emperor continues:\r\n\r\n     \"How is this wonderful success of the house of Hohenzollern\r\n     to be explained? Solely in this way, that every prince of\r\n     the House is conscious from the beginning that he is only an\r\n     earthly vicegerent, who must give an account of his labour\r\n     to a higher King and Master, and show that he has been a\r\n     faithful executor of the high commands laid upon him.\"\r\n\r\nOne finds exactly the same idea expressed three months later when\r\ntalking to his \"Men of Brandenburg.\" \"You know well,\" he reminded\r\nthem,\r\n\r\n     \"that I regard my whole position and my task as laid on me\r\n     by Heaven, and that I am appointed by a Higher Power to whom\r\n     I must later render an account. Accordingly I can assure you\r\n     that not a morning or evening passes without a prayer for my\r\n     people and a special thought for my Mark Brandenburg.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Anglo-Saxon understanding, of course, the theory of divine\r\nright has long appeared untenable, obsolete, and, as Macaulay says,\r\nabsurd. Many people to-day would go farther and argue that there is no\r\nsuch thing as a divine right at all, since \"rights\" are a purely human\r\nidea, possibly a purely legal one. But it is at least doubtful that\r\nthe Emperor uses the expression \"von Gottes Gnaden\" in a sense exactly\r\ncoterminous with that of \"divine right\" as used by Lord Macaulay and\r\nlater Anglo-Saxon writers and speakers. The latter, when dealing with\r\nthings German, not unfrequently fall into the error of mistranslation\r\nand are thus at times responsible for national misunderstandings. The\r\nItalian saying, \"_traduttore, tradittore_,\" is the expression of a\r\nfact too seldom recognized, especially by those whose business it is\r\nto interpret, so to speak, one people to another. Language is as\r\nmysterious and elusive a thing as aught connected with humanity, as\r\nlove, for example, or music; and it may be asserted with some degree\r\nof confidence that among every people there are ideas current, and in\r\nall departments--in law, society, art--which it is impossible exactly\r\nto translate into the speech of other nations. The words used may be\r\nthe same, but the connotation, all the words imply and suggest, is,\r\nperhaps in very important respects, different, and requires a\r\nparaphrase, longer or shorter, to explain them. Take the word \"false\"\r\nin English and \"falsch\" in German. They look alike, yet while the\r\nEnglish \"false\" carries with it a moral reproach, the German word,\r\nwhere the context does not explicitly prove otherwise, means simply\r\n\"incorrect,\" \"erroneous,\" without the moral reproach added.\r\nAccordingly, when a German Chancellor asserts that the statement of an\r\nEnglish Minister is \"falsch\" he does not necessarily mean anything\r\noffensive, but only that the English Minister is mistaken.\r\n\r\nFrom this point of view one may regard the statements of the Emperor\r\nconcerning his kingly office. He has recently begun to use the\r\nexpression \"German Emperor von Gottes Gnaden,\" a thing done by none of\r\nhis imperial predecessors, and certainly a very curious extension of a\r\ndoctrine which traditionally only applies to wearers of the crown of\r\nPrussia. But if he does, it may, it is here suggested, be considered\r\nfurther evidence that he employs the terms \"von Gottes Gnaden\" in a\r\nsense other than that of \"divine right\" as conceived by the\r\nAnglo-Saxon. The German \"Gnade\" means \"favour,\" \"grace,\" \"mercy,\"\r\n\"pity,\" or \"blessing,\" and is at times used in direct contrast with\r\nthe word \"Recht,\" which means \"justice\" as well as \"right.\" The point,\r\nindeed, need hardly be elaborated, and the Emperor's own explanation\r\nof the revelation of God to mankind, with its special reference to his\r\ngrandfather which we shall find later in the confession of faith to\r\nAdmiral Hollmann, is highly significant of the sense in which he\r\nregards himself and every ruling Hohenzollern as selected for the\r\nduties of Prussian kingship. It is the work of the kingship he is\r\ndivinely appointed to do of which he is always thinking, not the legal\r\nright to the kingship _vis à vis_ his people he is mistakenly supposed\r\nto claim. He regards himself as a trustee, not as the owner of the\r\nproperty. And is not such a spirit a proper and praiseworthy one? In a\r\nsense we Christians, if in a position of responsibility, believe that\r\nwe are all divinely appointed to the work each of us has to do:\r\ninstruments of God, who shapes our ends, rough-hew them how we may.\r\nThe Emperor finely says of the Almighty: \"He breathed into man His\r\nbreath, that is a portion of Himself, a soul.\" Reason is what chiefly\r\ndistinguishes man from the brute, though there are those who hold that\r\nreason is but a higher form of brutish instinct, which again has its\r\ndegree among the brutes; but, assuming that reason is of divine\r\norigin, enabling us to receive, by one means or another, the dictates\r\nof the Almighty, it seems clear that there must be channels through\r\nwhich these dictates become known to us.\r\n\r\nThis conveyance, this making plain is, as many people, and the Emperor\r\namong them, believe, performed by God through the agency of those whom\r\nmankind agree to call \"great.\" For the last nineteen centuries a large\r\npart of civilized mankind is at one in the belief that Christ was such\r\nan agency, while millions again agree to call the agency Buddha,\r\nMahomet, Confucius, or Zoroaster. In the creed of Islam Christ, as a\r\nprophet, comes fifth from Adam. In America there are thousands who\r\nbelieve, or did believe, in the agency of a Mrs. Eddy or a Dr. Dowie.\r\nAnd if this is so in matters of religion, itself only a form of the\r\nreasoning soul, why should it not be the same in morals or philosophy,\r\nart or science, government or administration: why should we not all\r\naccept, as many still do, the sayings and writings of the Hebrew\r\nprophets (as does the Emperor), of Plato and Aristotle, of Bacon and\r\nHobbes, of Milton and Shakespeare and Goethe, of Kepler and Galileo,\r\nor Charlemagne and Napoleon, as divinely intended to convey and make\r\nplain to us the dictates of Heaven until such time as yet greater\r\nsouls shall instruct us afresh and still more fully?\r\n\r\nIt may be that the Emperor thinks in some such way; his speeches and\r\nedicts at least suggest it. Certainly, as already mentioned, he did on\r\none occasion, when speaking of his kingship, employ the word \"right\"\r\nas descriptive of the nature of his appointment by God. But that was\r\nearly in his reign, and at no time since has he insisted on a\r\nHeaven-granted right to rule. It was, no doubt, different with some of\r\nhis absolute predecessors, but it was not the view of Frederick the\r\nGreat, who declared himself \"the first servant of the State.\"\r\nMoreover, it is hardly conceivable that the Emperor, who is acquainted\r\nwith the facts of history and is a man of practical common sense\r\nbesides, does not know that the doctrine of \"divine right\" has long\r\nbeen rejected by people of intelligence in every civilized country,\r\nincluding his own.\r\n\r\nIf he really believes in divine right in the Stuart sense he must\r\nthink that the conditions of Germany are so different from those of\r\nthe rest of civilized mankind, and his own people so little advanced\r\nin knowledge and political science, that a doctrine absurd and\r\ndangerous to the peace of enlightened commonwealths is applicable as a\r\nbasis of rule in his own. It seems a more plausible view, that the\r\nEmperor considers the expression \"von Gottes Gnaden\" an academic\r\nformula of government, or what is still more likely, as a moral and\r\nreligious, not a legal, dogma, which yet expresses one of the leading\r\nand most admirable features of his policy as a ruler. If it is not so,\r\nhe is inconsistent with himself, since he has repeatedly declared\r\nhimself bound by the Constitution in accordance with which his\r\ngrandfather and father and he himself have hitherto ruled. At present\r\nthe doctrine of divine \"right\" is regarded by Germans no less than by\r\nEnglishmen as dead and buried, and mention of it in Germany is usually\r\ngreeted with a smile. Even the notion of appointment by divine\r\n\"grace,\" while considered a harmless and praiseworthy article of faith\r\nwith the Emperor, is no longer regarded as a living principle of\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACCESSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1888-1890\r\n\r\nWith his accession began for the Emperor a period of extraordinary\r\nactivity which has continued practically undiminished to the present\r\nday. During that time he has been the most prominent man and monarch\r\nof his generation. From the domestic point of view his life perhaps\r\nhas not been marked by many notable events, but from the point of view\r\nof politics and international relations it has been the history of his\r\nreign and to no small extent the history of the world.\r\n\r\nWhen a German Emperor ascends the throne there is no great outburst of\r\nnational rejoicing, no great series of popular ceremonials. There is\r\nno brilliant procession as in England, no impressive coronation like\r\nthat of an English monarch in Westminster Abbey, no State visit of the\r\nmonarch to the Houses of Parliament. In Germany Parliament goes to the\r\nKing, not the King to Parliament.\r\n\r\nOn the same day that the Emperor began his reign he addressed\r\nproclamations to the army and navy. The addresses to the people and\r\nthe Parliament were to come a few days later. In the proclamation to\r\nthe army he said:\r\n\r\n     \"I and the army were born for each other. Let us remain\r\n     indissolubly so connected, come peace or storm, as God may\r\n     will. You will now take the oath of fidelity and obedience\r\n     to me, and I swear always to remember that the eyes of my\r\n     ancestors are bent on me from the other world, and that one\r\n     day I shall have to give an account touching the fame and\r\n     the honour of the army.\"\r\n\r\nHis address to the navy was in the same vein.\r\n\r\n     \"We have only just put off mourning for my unforgettable\r\n     grandfather, Kaiser William I, and already we have had to\r\n     lower the flag for my beloved father, who took such an\r\n     interest in the growth and progress of the navy. A time of\r\n     earnest and sincere sorrow, however, strengthens the mind\r\n     and heart of man, and so let us, keeping at heart the\r\n     example of my grandfather and father, look with confidence\r\n     to the future. I have learned to appreciate the high sense\r\n     of honour and of duty which lives in the navy, and know that\r\n     every man is ready faithfully to stake his life for the\r\n     honour of the German flag, be it where it may. Accordingly I\r\n     can, in this serious hour, feel fully assured that we shall\r\n     stand strongly and steadily together in good or bad days, in\r\n     storm or sunshine, always mindful of the Fatherland and\r\n     always ready to shed our heart's blood for the honour of the\r\n     flag.\"\r\n\r\nTo his people he promised that he would be a\r\n\r\n     \"just and mild prince, observant of piety and religion, a\r\n     protector of peace, a promoter of the country's prosperity,\r\n     a helper to the poor and needy, a faithful guardian of the\r\n     right.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Parliament a week later he announced that he meant to walk in\r\nthe footsteps of his grandfather, particularly in regard to the\r\nworking classes, to acquire the confidence of the federated princes,\r\nthe affection of the people, and the friendly recognition of foreign\r\ncountries. He said that in his opinion the\r\n\r\n     \"most important duties of the German Emperor lay in the\r\n     domain of the military and political security of the nation\r\n     externally, and internally in the supervision of the\r\n     carrying out of imperial laws.\"\r\n\r\nThe highest of these laws, he explained, was the Imperial Constitution\r\nand \"to preserve and protect the Constitution, and in especial the\r\nrights it gives to the legislative bodies, to every German, but also\r\nto the Emperor and the federated states,\" he considered \"among the\r\nmost honourable duties of the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the order of these addresses is different to what it would be in\r\nEngland, it entirely accords with the spirit of the Prussian monarchy\r\nand the political system of the German people. Settled in the heart of\r\nEurope, the nation rests on the army, and it is hardly too much to say\r\nthat, from the Emperor's point of view, possibly also from the popular\r\nGerman point of view, the interests of the army must be considered\r\nbefore the interests of the rest of the population. An English\r\nmonarch, who issued his first address to the British navy, would be as\r\njustified in doing so by the real necessities of Great Britain as a\r\nGerman Emperor who first addresses the German army is justified by the\r\nreal necessities of Germany; for the British navy is as vital to the\r\nBritish as the German army is to the German nation. In England,\r\nhowever, the monarch's respect for the people and Parliament takes\r\nprecedence of his respect for the army, not _vice versa_ as in\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nIn a speech from the throne to the Prussian Diet the Emperor took the\r\nConstitutional Oath: \"I swear to hold firmly and unbrokenly to the\r\nConstitution of the Kingdom and to rule in agreement with it and the\r\nlaws ... so help me God!\" and went on to proclaim the continuance in\r\nPrussia and the Empire of his grandfather's and father's policy and\r\nwork. He said at the same time, while undertaking not to make the\r\nPeople uneasy by trying to extend Crown rights, that he would take\r\ncare that the constitutional rights of the Crown were respected and\r\nused, and that he meant to hand them over unimpaired to his successor.\r\nHe concluded by saying that he would always bear in mind the words of\r\nFrederick the Great, who described himself as the \"first servant of\r\nthe State.\"\r\n\r\nAt Frankfurt-on-the-Oder, a few months later, he declared, when\r\nunveiling a monument to his uncle, Prince Frederick Karl, a hero of\r\nthe Franco-Prussian War, that he meant never to surrender a stone of\r\nthe acquisitions made in the war and\r\n\r\n     \"believed he voiced the feeling of the entire army in saying\r\n     that Germany, rather than do so, would suffer its eighteen\r\n     army corps and its whole population of 42 millions to perish\r\n     on the field of battle.\"\r\n\r\nAt this period of his career the Emperor was, first and foremost, a\r\nthoroughgoing Hohenzollern. Doubtless he is so still, if he talks less\r\nabout the dynasty. He admired Frederick the Great, then as now, and in\r\nthe first place as military commander, but the ancestor with whom he\r\neven more sympathized, and sympathizes, was the Great Elector. \"The\r\nancestor,\" he said himself,\r\n\r\n     \"for whom I have the most liking (_Schwärmen_, a hardly\r\n     translatable German verb, is the word he used) and who\r\n     always shone before me as an example in my youth, was the\r\n     Great Elector, the man who loved his country with all his\r\n     heart and strength, and unrestingly devoted himself to\r\n     rescuing the Mark Brandenburg out of its deep distress and\r\n     made it a strong and united whole.\"\r\n\r\nWhat particularly attracted the Emperor in the history of the Elector\r\nwas the fact that he was the first Hohenzollern who saw the importance\r\nof promoting trade and industry, building a navy, and acquiring\r\ncolonies. As yet, however, the Emperor had only clear and fairly\r\ndefinite ideas about the need for a navy. The world-policy may have\r\nbeen in embryo in his mind, but it was not born.\r\n\r\nThe imaginative side of the Emperor's character at this period is well\r\nillustrated in a speech he made in 1890 to his favourite \"Men of the\r\nMark.\" He was talking of his travels, to which allusion had been made\r\nby a previous speaker.\r\n\r\n\"My travels,\" said the Emperor,\r\n\r\n     \"have not only had the object of making myself acquainted\r\n     with foreign countries and institutions, or to create\r\n     friendly relations with neighbouring monarchs, but these\r\n     journeys, which have been the subject of much\r\n     misunderstanding, had for me the great value that, withdrawn\r\n     from the heat of party faction, I could review our domestic\r\n     conditions from a distance and submit them to calm\r\n     consideration. Any one who, standing on a ship's bridge far\r\n     out at sea, with only God's starry heaven above him,\r\n     communes with himself, will not fail to appreciate the worth\r\n     of such a journey. For many of my fellow-countrymen I would\r\n     wish that they might live through such an hour, in which one\r\n     can make up an account as to what he has attempted and what\r\n     achieved. Then would he be cured of exaggerated\r\n     self-estimation, and that we all need.\"\r\n\r\nHaving discharged the duty of addressing his own subjects, the\r\nEmperor's next care, after a stay at Kiel where a German Emperor and\r\nKing now for the first time in history appeared in the uniform of an\r\nadmiral, was personally to announce his accession at the courts of his\r\nfellow-European sovereigns. We find him, accordingly, paying visits to\r\nAlexander II in St. Petersburg, to King Oscar II in Stockholm (where\r\nhe received a telegram announcing the birth of his fifth son), to\r\nChristian IX in Copenhagen, to Kaiser Franz Joseph in Vienna and to\r\nKing Humbert in Rome. To both the last-mentioned he presented himself\r\nin the additional capacity of Triplice ally.\r\n\r\nIn August of the year following his accession he paid his first visit\r\nas Emperor to England. It was a very different thing, one may imagine,\r\nfrom the earliest recorded visit of a German Emperor to the English\r\nCourt. That was in 1416, when the Emperor Sigismund (1411-1437)\r\narrived there and was received by Henry V. Henry postponed the opening\r\nof Parliament specially on his account, made him a Knight of the\r\nGarter, and signed with him at Canterbury an offensive and defensive\r\nalliance against France. How poor the German Empire and the German\r\nEmperor were at that epoch may be judged from the fact that on his way\r\nhome Sigismund had to pawn the costly gifts he had received in\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion a grand naval review of over a hundred\r\nwarships, with crews totalling 25,000 men, was held in honour of the\r\nEmperor at Osborne. This was followed, a few days afterwards, by a\r\nparade of the troops at Aldershot under the command of General Sir\r\nEvelyn Wood. On this occasion, after expressing his admiration for the\r\nBritish troops, the Emperor concluded: \"At Malplaquet and Waterloo,\r\nPrussian and British blood flowed in the prosecution of a common\r\nenterprise.\" In a little speech after the review the Emperor spoke of\r\nthe English navy as \"the finest in the world.\" The impression made by\r\nthe Emperor on Sir Evelyn has been recorded by that general. \"The\r\nEmperor is extremely wide-awake,\" he writes to a friend, \"with a\r\ndecided, straightforward manner. He is a good rider. His quick and\r\nvery intelligent spirit seizes every detail at a glance, and he\r\npossesses a wonderful memory.\" The Emperor was now nominated an\r\nhonorary Admiral of the British navy and as a return compliment made\r\nQueen Victoria honorary \"Chef\" of his own First Dragoon Guards. At the\r\nnaval review a journalist asked an English naval officer what would\r\nhappen if the Emperor, in command of a German fleet, should meet a\r\nBritish fleet in time of war between England and Germany?--\"Would the\r\nBritish fleet have to salute the Emperor?\" \"Certainly,\" replied the\r\nnaval officer; \"it would fire 100 guns at him.\"\r\n\r\nNext year the Emperor was again in England, this time to be present at\r\nthe Cowes regatta, which he took part in regularly during the four\r\nsucceeding years, noting, doubtless, all that might prove useful for\r\nthe development of the Kiel yachting \"week,\" the success of which he\r\nhad then, as always since, particularly at heart. He was received by\r\nQueen Victoria with the simple and homely words, \"Welcome, William!\"\r\n\r\nA State visit to the City of London followed, when he was accompanied\r\nby the Empress, and was entertained to a luncheon given by the City\r\nFathers in the Guildhall. The entertainment, which took place on July\r\n10, 1891, was remarkable for a speech delivered by the Emperor in\r\nEnglish, in which, besides declaring his intention of maintaining the\r\n\"historical friendship\" between England and Germany, he proclaimed\r\nthat his great object \"above all\" was the preservation of peace,\r\n\"since peace alone can inspire that confidence which is requisite for\r\na healthy development of science, art, and commerce.\" On the same\r\noccasion he expressed his feeling of \"being at home\" in England--\"this\r\ndelightful country\"--and spoke of the \"same blood which flows alike in\r\nthe veins of Germans and English.\" Shortly afterwards he attended a\r\nreview of volunteers at Wimbledon, and, as he said, was \"agreeably\r\nastonished at the spectacle of so many citizen-soldiers in a country\r\nthat had no conscription.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor returned from England to receive the visit of his chief\r\nTriplice ally, the Emperor Franz Joseph, and to discuss with him\r\ndoubtless the European situation. Bismarck has been pictured as\r\nsitting at the European chessboard pondering the moves necessary tor\r\nGermany to win the game of which the great prize was the hegemony of\r\nEurope. The chief opposing Pieces, whose aid or neutrality was\r\ndesirable, were for long France, Russia, Austria, and Italy; but in\r\n1883, with the conclusion of the Triple Alliance, Austria and Italy\r\nneeded less to be considered, and the only two really important\r\nopposing pieces left were France and Russia. Still, Germany, through\r\nher allies of the Triplice, might be dragged into war, and\r\nconsequently the doings of Austria and Italy, both in relation to one\r\nanother and to France and Russia were, as they now are, of great\r\nimportance to her.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the accession, the chessboard of our metaphor was\r\nmainly occupied with Franco-German relations and with Russian designs\r\non Constantinople, the Dardanelles, and the Black Sea. The danger to\r\nGermany of war with France, which had arisen out of the Boulanger and\r\nSchnaebele incidents, had died down, but not altogether ceased.\r\nHohenlohe tells us how at this time, in conversation with the Emperor,\r\nthe latter ventured the forecast: \"Boulanger is sure to succeed. I\r\nprophesy that as Kaiser Ernest he will pay a visit to Berlin.\" He was\r\nwrong, we know, as so many prophets are.\r\n\r\nRussian designs on Turkey had had to reckon with the opposition of\r\nEngland and Austria. As regards these designs, Bismarck says:\r\n\r\n     \"Germany's policy should be one of reserve. Germany would\r\n     act very foolishly if in Oriental questions, without having\r\n     special interests, she took a side before the other Powers,\r\n     who were more nearly interested: she would therefore do well\r\n     to refrain from making her move as long as possible, and\r\n     thus, besides, gain the benefit of longer peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor, however, admitted that against the advantages of a\r\npolicy of reserve had to be set the disadvantage of Germany's position\r\nin the centre of Europe with its frontiers exposed to the attacks of a\r\ncoalition. \"From this situation,\" said the Chancellor, \"it results\r\nthat Germany is perhaps the only Great Power in Europe which is not\r\ntempted to attain its ends by victorious war.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our interest,\" he goes on,\r\n\r\n     \"is to maintain peace, whereas our continental neighbours\r\n     without exception have wishes, either secret or officially\r\n     admitted, which can only be fulfilled through war.\r\n     Consequently, German policy must be to prevent war or\r\n     confine it as much as possible: to keep in the background\r\n     while the European game of cards is going on: and not by\r\n     loss of patience or concession at the cost of the country,\r\n     or vanity, or provocation from friends, allow ourselves to\r\n     be driven from the waiting attitude: otherwise--_plectuntur\r\n     Achivi!_--third parties will rejoice.\"\r\n\r\nThat was the Bismarckian policy twenty-five years ago, and though new\r\neconomic conditions have had great influence in modifying it since,\r\nparticularly as it regards the East, it is practically Germany's\r\npolicy now.\r\n\r\nIn his first speech from the throne to the Reichstag the Emperor thus\r\nreferred to the Triple Alliance:\r\n\r\n     \"Our Alliance with Austria-Hungary is publicly known. I hold\r\n     to the same with German fidelity, not merely because it has\r\n     been concluded, but because I see in this defensive union a\r\n     foundation for the balance of power in Europe and a legacy\r\n     of German history, the importance of which is recognized by\r\n     the whole of the German people, while it accords with\r\n     European international law as undeniably in force up to\r\n     1866. Similar historical relations and similar national\r\n     exigences of the time bind us to Italy. Both Germany and\r\n     Italy desire to prolong the blessings of peace that they may\r\n     pursue in tranquillity the consolidation of their newly\r\n     acquired unity, the betterment of their national\r\n     institutions, and the increase of their prosperity.\"\r\n\r\nIn a speech a few months later he declared that the Alliance had no\r\nother purpose than to strengthen the peaceful relations of Germany to\r\nother foreign Powers. His next public reference to it was in May,\r\n1900, when Kaiser Franz Joseph visited Berlin on the occasion of the\r\ncoming of age of the German Crown Prince. \"Truly,\" exclaimed the\r\nEmperor, in a vein of some exaggeration,\r\n\r\n     \"this Alliance is not alone an agreement in the eyes of the\r\n     monarchs, but the longer it has existed, the deeper has it\r\n     taken root in the convictions of the peoples, and the moment\r\n     that the hearts of the peoples beat in unison nothing can\r\n     tear them asunder. Common interests, common feelings, joy\r\n     and sorrow shared together, unite our three nations for now\r\n     twenty years, and although often enough misunderstandings\r\n     and sarcasm and criticisms have been poured out on them, the\r\n     three peoples have succeeded in maintaining peace hitherto,\r\n     and are regarded by the whole world as its champions.\"\r\n\r\nThe history of the Triplice may be shortly related here as, along with\r\nhis navy, it is regarded by the Emperor as the chief factor in the\r\npreservation of the world's peace, and is, in fact, as has been said,\r\nthe foundation of his foreign policy. It arose from Bismarck's desire\r\nto be independent of Russia and from his dread of a European\r\ncoalition--for example, that of France, Austria, and Russia--against\r\nthe German Empire. \"We had,\" Bismarck writes,\r\n\r\n     \"carried on successful war against two of the European Great\r\n     Powers (Austria and France), and it became advisable to\r\n     withdraw at least one of them from the temptation to revenge\r\n     which lay in the prospect an alliance with others offered.\r\n     It could not be France, as any one who knew the history and\r\n     temperament of the two peoples could see, nor England owing\r\n     to her dislike of permanent alliances, nor Italy as her\r\n     support alone was insufficient against an anti-German\r\n     coalition; so that the choice lay between Austria-Hungary\r\n     and Russia.\"\r\n\r\nFor many reasons Bismarck would have preferred the Russian alliance,\r\namong others the traditional dynastic friendship between the two\r\ncountries and the fact that no natural political or religious causes\r\nof conflict existed between them; while a union with Austria was less\r\nreliable, owing to the changeable nature of her public opinion, the\r\nheterogeneousness of her Magyar, Slav, and Catholic populations, and\r\nthe loss of influence by the German element with the governing body.\r\nOn the other hand, however, an alliance with Austria would be nothing\r\nnew, internationally, as such a connection theoretically arose from\r\nthe former connection of Germany and Austria in the Holy Roman Empire.\r\nWhile weighing the matter, a threatening letter from Czar Alexander II\r\nto William I, in which he called on Germany to support his Balkan\r\npolicy, and said that if he refused peace could not last between their\r\ntwo countries, decided Bismarck in favour of Austria. The chief\r\nopponent of the new Alliance was William I, who was moved by personal\r\nchivalric feelings towards his nephew, Czar Alexander; but,\r\ndisregarding this, because confident of eventually persuading his\r\nimperial master, Bismarck went to Gastein and there settled with the\r\nAustrian Minister, Count Andrassy, the principles of the Alliance.\r\nItaly came into the Alliance in 1883 as the immediate result of France\r\nobtaining a protectorate in Tunis, in return, partly, for her\r\nacquiescence in the English acquisition of Cyprus. The protectorate\r\naroused general indignation and fear in Italy, and though it meant a\r\nlarge expenditure on naval and military armament, on May 20, 1882, she\r\njoined the Dual Alliance for five years, and thus turned it into the\r\nTriplice.\r\n\r\nThe Triple Alliance rests on three treaties: one between Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary, one between Germany and Italy, and one between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Italy. While by the first Germany and\r\nAustria-Hungary bind themselves to combine in case of an attack on\r\neither by Russia, whether as original foe or as ally, and to observe\r\n\"at least\" benevolent neutrality in case of attack from any other\r\nquarter, by the second Germany and Italy bind themselves to mutual\r\nsupport in case of an attack on either by France. The third, between\r\nAustria-Hungary and Italy, binds the signatories to benevolent\r\nneutrality in case Austria-Hungary is attacked by Russia, or Italy by\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThat there are weak points in the Triple Alliance is obvious. If\r\nAustria-Hungary were a purely homogeneous country like France or\r\nRussia, Germany and Austria-Hungary, even without Italy, could face\r\nwith confidence an attack from either or both their powerful\r\nneighbours. But Austria-Hungary is not homogeneous. A large proportion\r\nof her population is anti-German, or at least non-German, and Italy is\r\nalways subject to be tempted by an opportunity of obtaining some of\r\nAustria-Hungary's Adriatic possessions. Moreover, a large party is\r\neven now to be found in Austria-Hungary which desires revenge for the\r\nhumiliation of her defeat by Germany in 1866.\r\n\r\nThe relations of Germany to Russia have always been rather those of\r\nfriendship between the monarchs of the two countries than of\r\nfriendship between the two peoples; and it is easy to understand that\r\nthe fear of revolution, Socialism, or \"government of the people, by\r\nthe people, for the people,\" to use Lincoln's celebrated phrase, at\r\nall times forms a strong and active bond of sympathy between the\r\nmonarchs. In the case of Russia there is also always to be considered\r\nthe obstinate, or as the Emperor would call it knightly, spirit in\r\nwhich his grandfather, King William I, regarded his obligation to\r\nmaintain friendship with the Czar, and which for a long time made him\r\nhostile to the idea of alliance with Austria instead of alliance with\r\nRussia. The feeling, it is highly probable, is strong, if not equally\r\nstrong, in the mind of the Emperor to-day, if only out of respect for\r\nthe memory of his ancestor. There is not, to use a popular expression,\r\nmuch love lost between the two peoples, not only because of racial\r\ndifferences between Teuton and Slav, but because of the differences in\r\nreligion and in degree of civilization. There are not a few Germans\r\nwho assert that Germany's next war will be with Russia, and that from\r\nthe dominions of the Czar will be obtained the fresh territory Germany\r\nneeds for her constantly expanding population.\r\n\r\nThe Czar returned the Emperor's accession visit in Berlin in October,\r\n1889, and it was on this occasion that the first sign of trouble\r\nbetween the Emperor and the old Chancellor showed itself. When the\r\nEmperor first proposed to make his round of visits of accession to\r\nforeign sovereigns, Bismarck agreed except as regarded Russia and\r\nEngland, objecting that visits to these countries would have an\r\nalternatively bad effect in each. The Emperor, however, as has been\r\nnoted, went to Russia. During the return visit in Berlin, Bismarck had\r\nan interview with the Czar which resulted in the final adjustment of\r\nRusso-German relations, but at its close the Czar said, \"Yes, I\r\nbelieve you and have confidence in you, but are you sure you will\r\nremain in office?\" Bismarck looked surprised, and said, \"Certainly,\r\nMajesty; I am quite certain I shall remain in office all my life\"--an\r\nodd thing, one may remark, for a man to say, who must have been\r\nfamiliar with the saying, \"Put not your trust in princes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Czar was going away, both the Emperor and Bismarck\r\naccompanied him to the station, and on their return the Emperor gave\r\nthe old Chancellor a seat in his carriage. The talk concerned the\r\nvisit just over, and the Emperor again announced his intention of\r\nspending some time in Russia the following year. Bismarck now advised\r\nagainst the project on the ground that it would arouse hostility in\r\nAustria, and because \"it was not suitable considering the Czar's\r\ndisposition towards the Emperor.\"\r\n\r\n\"What disposition? What do you mean? How do you know?\" questioned the\r\nEmperor quickly.\r\n\r\n\"From confidential letters I am in the habit of receiving from St.\r\nPetersburg, in addition to official reports,\" replied the Chancellor.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor expressed a wish to see the letters, but Bismarck gave an\r\nevasive answer. The result was a temporary coolness between Emperor\r\nand Chancellor.\r\n\r\nFrom a memorandum of Prince Hohenlohe's we get a glimpse of one of the\r\npolitical currents and anti-currents just now running high. Prince\r\nHohenlohe writes under date, June 27, 1888, when the Emperor was\r\nhardly a fortnight on the throne:--\r\n\r\n     \"Last evening at 8 left Berlin with Thaden after supping\r\n     with Victor and Franz (son and nephew) in the Kaiserhof\r\n     Hotel. Paid several visits during the day. I found Friedberg\r\n     somewhat depressed. He is no longer the big man he was in\r\n     the Emperor Frederick's time, when everybody courted him. He\r\n     knows that the Emperor does not favour Jews. Then I visited\r\n     the new chief of the Cabinet (civil), Lucanus, a courtly,\r\n     polished, obliging man, who looks more like an elegant\r\n     Austrian privy councillor. Wilmoski inspires me with more\r\n     confidence. At 5 to Bleichroeder's (Bleichroeder was the\r\n     great Jew banker). We spoke, or rather he spoke first, about\r\n     the political situation. He is satisfied, and says Bismarck\r\n     is too. Only the Emperor must take care to keep out of the\r\n     hands of the Orthodox. People in the country wouldn't stand\r\n     that. (He is right there, comments Hohenlohe.) Waldersee and\r\n     his followers, he said, was another danger. Waldersee was a\r\n     foe of Bismarck's and thought himself fit for anything and\r\n     everything. Who knows but that these gentlemen wouldn't\r\n     begin the old game and say to the Emperor, 'You are simply\r\n     nothing but a doll. Bismarck is the real ruler.' On the old\r\n     Emperor this would have made no impression, but the young\r\n     one would be more sensitive. Bismarck, therefore, wanted\r\n     Waldersee's banishment, and would, if he could, send him to\r\n     Strasburg (where Hohenlohe was Statthalter) as commanding\r\n     general. Perhaps he was only aiming at making me (Hohenlohe)\r\n     sick of my post and so get rid of Waldersee, his enemy, when\r\n     I cleared out. Bleichroeder said Bismarck only introduced\r\n     the compulsory pass system to show the Emperor that he too\r\n     could act sharply against the French, and so as to take the\r\n     wind out of the sails of the military party. Bismarck was\r\n     thinking above all about seating his son Herbert firmly in\r\n     the saddle (Herbert was Secretary of State for Foreign\r\n     Affairs). That is the sole motive of his action and thought.\r\n     There was therefore no prospect of matters in the Rhineland\r\n     improving. As to Russia, Bleichroeder expected some\r\n     occurrence, something out of the way (_exotisches_) by which\r\n     Russia might be won, either the withdrawal of troops from\r\n     the frontier or a meeting of Emperors. The Emperor, Bismarck\r\n     said, would not begin a war. If it came, however, it would\r\n     not be unwelcome to him.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe also tells of a visit he paid in the month of the\r\naccession to the widowed Empress Frederick. \"She is much bowed down,\"\r\nhe said,\r\n\r\n     \"very harassed-looking, and I feel sure that all this recent\r\n     time, all the last year in fact, she has been displaying an\r\n     artificial good-humour, for now I find her in deep distress.\r\n     At first she could not speak for weeping. We spoke of the\r\n     Emperor Frederick's last days, then she recovered herself a\r\n     little and complained of the wickedness and meanness of men,\r\n     by which she meant to allude to certain people.... Herbert\r\n     Bismarck had had the impudence to tell the Prince of Wales\r\n     (later Edward VII) that an Emperor who could not talk and\r\n     discuss things should not be allowed to reign, and so on.\r\n     The Prince of Wales, the Empress said, told Herbert that if\r\n     it were not that he valued good relations between England\r\n     and Germany, he would have thrown him out of the door....\r\n     Waldersee was a false, unprincipled wretch, who would think\r\n     nothing of ruining his country if he could only satisfy his\r\n     own personal ambition.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe finally called on the Prince of Wales, who \"spoke\r\nprudently, but showed his disgust at the roughness of the Bismarcks,\r\nand could not understand their policy of irritating France.\"\r\n\r\nThe particular question concerning France that was agitating Germany\r\nat the time of the accession was the state of affairs in\r\nAlsace-Lorraine, and particularly Bismarck's measure requiring French\r\ncitizens entering the provinces to provide themselves with a pass from\r\nthe German Ambassador in Paris. The amiable and conciliatory\r\nStatthalter, Prince Hohenlohe, had to make a reluctant journey to\r\nBerlin in connexion with this question. There was another question\r\nalso weighing on his mind--the question whether or not he should have\r\na sentry guard before his official residence in Strasburg. The\r\nmilitary authorities, whose rivalry with the civil authorities\r\neverywhere in Germany for influence and power still continues, wanted\r\nto have the sentries abolished, but the Prince eventually had his way.\r\nHe showed Bismarck that they were necessary for his reputation with\r\nthe population, which had already begun to think less of his influence\r\nas Statthalter owing to his one day at a review having incautiously\r\nand gallantly taken a back seat in his carriage in favour of some lady\r\nguests.\r\n\r\nIn normal times the composers of speeches from the throne are\r\naccustomed to describe the relations between their own and foreign\r\ncountries as \"friendly.\" When the relations are not friendly, yet not\r\nthe opposite, they are usually registered on the political barometer\r\nas \"correct.\" The attitude on both sides is formal, rigorously polite,\r\nreserved; such as would become a pair of people who had once been at\r\nfeud and after their quarrel had been fought out agreed, if only for\r\nthe sake of appearances, to show no outward animosity, but on the\r\nother hand not give an inch of way. The position of France and Germany\r\nis \"correct\"; it has never been friendly since 1870; and it must be\r\nmany a long year before it can be friendly again. Apart from the\r\ndifference between the Latin and Teutonic temperaments, apart from the\r\nlegacy of hate left in Germany against France by the sufferings and\r\nhumiliations the great Napoleon caused her, apart from the fact that\r\none people is republican and the other monarchical, there is always\r\none thing that will prevent reconciliation--the loss by France of the\r\nfair provinces Alsace and Lorraine. It is of no use for Germany to\r\nremind France that up to the Peace of Westphalia in 1648 this\r\nterritory belonged to Germany, or rather to what then was known by\r\nthat name. It was useless as well as ungracious for Bismarck to tell\r\nFrance to seek compensation in Africa for what she had lost in Europe.\r\nLike Rachel mourning for her children, France will not be comforted;\r\nand now, as from the heavy hour in which she lost the provinces, she\r\ngrieves over the memory of them and nurses the hope, still mingled\r\nwith hate, of one glorious day regaining them. There are sanguine\r\nspirits who assert that the old feeling is dying out, and the German\r\nGovernment studiously encourages that view. It may be so; time is\r\nhaving its obliterating effects; and in externals at least the\r\nGermanization of the provinces is slowly making progress. Still the\r\nwound is deep, and there seems no prospect of its healing.\r\n\r\nSeveral suggestions have been made with a view to an arrangement that\r\nmight leave France without reason, or with less reason, for constant\r\nmeditation on revenge One of them is the neutralization of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine on the model of Belgium, while another is the\r\ndistribution of the territory, so that while Alsace is divided between\r\nBaden and Bavaria, Lorraine becomes a part of Prussia A third would\r\ndivide the provinces between the two nations. An illustration of the\r\nyet prevailing feeling is found in the fact that large Alsatian firms\r\ninvariably use French in their correspondence with Berlin firms, and\r\nalmost as invariably refer to the \"customs-arrangement\" with Germany\r\nin 1871. They cannot bring themselves to use the word \"annexation.\"\r\n\r\nYet of late years--to anticipate somewhat the course of\r\nevents--Germany has made two important concessions to Alsace-Lorraine.\r\nThe first was the abrogation of the so-called \"Dictator-Paragraph,\"\r\nwhich was part of the law for administering the new provinces after\r\nthe war of 1870. Under the paragraph the Lieutenant-Governor\r\n(Oberpresident) of the Reichsland, as the newly incorporated territory\r\nis now officially known, was empowered in case of need to take command\r\nof the military forces and proclaim a state of siege. When announcing\r\nthe abrogation of the Paragraph in the Reichstag in 1902, Chancellor\r\nvon Bülow gave a résumé of the relations of the provinces to the\r\nEmpire since 1870. He stated that immediately after the war the\r\npopulation were not disposed to incorporation in the Empire, as they\r\nthought the new state of things would only be temporary and that\r\nFrance would soon reconquer the provinces. This state of feeling, the\r\nChancellor explained, naturally reacted on the Government, which\r\naccordingly laid down the principle that the claims of the provinces\r\nto equal political rights with other parts of the Empire could only be\r\nrecognized step by step, as the Government was satisfied that the\r\npopulation conformed to the new order of things.\r\n\r\nThe second important concession to the Provinces was made only\r\nrecently, when the provincial committee was replaced by a popularly\r\nelected Diet and the Provinces were granted three seats in the Federal\r\nCouncil. There is a proviso that in case of equality in the Council\r\nmeetings the votes shall not be allowed to turn the scale in favour of\r\nPrussia. The limitation is a concession to the susceptibilities of the\r\nother Federal states.\r\n\r\nGermany's relations with Great Britain at the time of the accession\r\nwere unclouded. Mr. Gladstone had been defeated on his Home Rule\r\nproposals and Lord Salisbury was back in power. A lull had occurred in\r\nBritish relations with the Transvaal. All nations, including Germany,\r\nwere beginning to turn their attention to the Orient with a view to\r\nthe acquisition in Asia of \"spheres of influence and spheres of\r\ninterest,\" but as yet English and German interests had not come\r\nanywhere into conflict.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's great internal foe and the object of his special enmity\r\nis the Social Democracy, and practically from the day of his accession\r\nhe has waged war with it. His attitude towards the Socialists requires\r\nno long description, since it logically results from his traditional\r\nconception of Prussian monarchy and from the revolutionary character\r\nof Social Democratic aims. While a young man he paid little or no\r\nattention to the movement, and probably regarded it as the \"passing\r\nphenomenon\" he subsequently declared it to be. In 1884 the number of\r\nSocial Democratic voters was something over half a million, and the\r\nnumber of Social Democratic members returned to the Reichstag 25: in\r\n1890, two years after the accession, the figures were a million and a\r\nhalf and 35 respectively.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's denunciation of Social Democrats has always been\r\nunmeasured. \"A crew undeserving the name of Germans,\" a \"plague that\r\nmust be extirpated,\" \"traitors,\" \"people without a country and enemies\r\nto religion,\" \"foes to the Empire and the country\"--such were a few of\r\nthe expressions he then and during the next few years publicly applied\r\nto three millions of his subjects. To-day, it may be added, the number\r\nof Social Democrats in Germany is well over four millions.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, in reply to a deputation of three coal miners'\r\nrepresentatives, the Emperor said:\r\n\r\n     \"As regards your demands, I will have them carefully\r\n     investigated (a phrase, by the way, not unknown in England)\r\n     by my Government, and let you know the result through the\r\n     usual official channels. Should, however, offences against\r\n     public peace and order occur, should a connexion between\r\n     your movement and Social Democratic circles be demonstrated,\r\n     I would not be in a position to weigh your wishes with my\r\n     royal goodwill, since for me every Social Democrat is the\r\n     same thing as a foe to the Empire and the Fatherland.\r\n     Accordingly, if I see that Social Democratic tendencies mix\r\n     with the movement and lead to unlawful opposition, I will\r\n     intervene with all my powers--and they are great.\"\r\n\r\nAnd a month later:\r\n\r\n     \"That the Radical agitation of the Social Democracy has\r\n     turned so many heads and hearts is due to the fact that in\r\n     schools, high and low, too little is taught about the cruel\r\n     deeds of the French Revolution and too little about the\r\n     heroic deeds of the War of Liberation, which was (with the\r\n     help of English bayonets, be it parenthetically remarked)\r\n     the salvation of the Fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1892, to anticipate by a year or two, in reply to a guest who had\r\nobserved that Social Democrats were not decreasing in numbers, the\r\nEmperor remarked:\r\n\r\n     \"The moment the Social Democracy feels itself in possession\r\n     of power it will not hesitate for an instant to attack the\r\n     Burghertum (middle classes) very energetically. No\r\n     exhibition of general benevolence is of any use against\r\n     these people--here only religious feeling, founded on\r\n     decided faith, can have any influence.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, referring to the murder of a manufacturer in Mulhausen,\r\nsaid: \"Another victim to the revolutionary movement kept alive by the\r\nSocialists. If only our people would act like men!\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet it is obvious, looking at it from the standpoint of to-day,\r\nthat an admirably organized movement with four million parliamentary\r\nvoters in an electorate of fourteen millions, with no members in an\r\nImperial Parliament of 397 with representatives, more or less\r\nnumerous, on almost every municipal board of any importance in the\r\nEmpire, with the power of disturbing at any moment the relations\r\nbetween capital and labour, upon which the prosperity, security, and\r\ncomfort of the whole population depend, and in intimate relations with\r\nthe Socialists of all other countries, cannot be merely ignored or\r\ndisposed of by scornful and sarcastic speeches, by official anathema,\r\nor even by close police supervision. There must be something behind it\r\nall which ought to be susceptible of explanation.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, attempting to conjecture what the something is, it\r\nwill be advisable, familiar to many though the facts must be, to\r\nrecapitulate, as briefly as possible, the history of the movement. Old\r\nas the story is, it is necessary to have some knowledge of it, for\r\nSocial Democracy is the great, perhaps the only, domestic political\r\nthorn in the Emperor's side.\r\n\r\nIt is a truism to say that the \"social question,\" the question how\r\nbest to organize society, is as old as society itself. Great thinkers\r\nall down the ages, from Plato to Sir Thomas More, from More to Jean\r\nJacques Rousseau, from Rousseau to Saint Simon, Fourier, Louis Blanc,\r\nLassalle, and Karl Marx, have devoted their attention to it. The\r\nFrench Revolutionists tried to solve it, and the revolutionary\r\nmovement of 1848 took up the problem in its turn.\r\n\r\nGerman Social Democracy may be referred for its source to the\r\nteachings of Louis Blanc, who formed in 1840 a workmen's society in\r\nParis. Blanc held, as the Social Democrats hold, that capitalism was\r\nthe cause of all social evil, and that the workman was powerless\r\nagainst it. He therefore proposed the establishment of workmen's\r\nsocieties for purposes of production, and the grant of the necessary\r\ncapital at a low rate of interest by the State. The doctrine was taken\r\nup in Germany with fiery enthusiasm by Ferdinand Lassalle, who, in\r\nMay, 1863, founded the General German Workmen's Society for a\r\n\"peaceful, lawful agitation\" in favour of universal suffrage as a\r\nfirst means to the desired end. Universal suffrage was granted by the\r\nNorth German Confederation in 1867, and in 1873 Lassalle's adherents\r\nnumbered 60,000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Karl Marx and his disciple, Frederic Engels, had been\r\npropagating their theories, and in 1848 the former published his\r\nfamous work on the ideal social state. At first Marx was a partizan of\r\nrevolutionary methods, but he subsequently recanted this view and\r\nproclaimed that the Socialistic aim in future should be the\r\n\"strengthening of the economic and political power of the workman so\r\nthat the expropriation of private property could be obtained by\r\nlegislation.\" The Marxian doctrine was adopted in Germany by Wilhelm\r\nLiebknecht and August Bebel, who, at Eisenach in 1869, founded the\r\nAssociation of Social Democratic Workmen, to which the present German\r\nparty owes its name. The Eisenach programme declared \"the economic\r\ndependence of the workmen on the monopolists of the tools of labour\r\nthe foundation of servitude and social evil,\" and demanded \"the\r\neconomic emancipation of the working classes.\" An attempt to get the\r\nLassalle society to join the Eisenacher society on an international\r\nbasis failed for the time, but the two associations finally coalesced\r\nat the Gotha Congress of 1875.\r\n\r\nThe attempt on the life of William I in 1878 by the anarchist Nobiling\r\nhad an important effect on the fortunes of the party and the character\r\nof its programme. The Socialist Laws were passed and the police began\r\na campaign against the Socialists, of which the mildest features were\r\nthe dissolution of societies, the searching of houses, the expulsion\r\nof suspected persons, and the interdiction of Socialist newspapers and\r\nperiodicals.\r\n\r\nFor the next few years the party held its annual congresses in\r\nSwitzerland or Denmark, but as the Socialist Laws ceased to have\r\neffect after three years, and were not then renewed, the party resumed\r\nits congresses in Germany. The Congress at Erfurt in 1891 resulted in\r\nthe issue of a new programme rejecting the Lassalle plan for the\r\nestablishment of workmen's societies for productive purposes and\r\nsubstituting for it the transfer of all capitalistic private property\r\nengaged in the means of production, such as lands, mines, raw\r\nmaterial, tools, machinery, and means of transport, to the State. The\r\nterm used in the programme is \"state,\" not \"society,\" but the State is\r\nin fact nothing but the society armed with coercive powers.\r\n\r\nOther objects are universal suffrage for both sexes over twenty,\r\nelectoral reform, two-year parliaments, direct legislation \"through\r\nthe people,\" some form of parliamentary government, autonomy of the\r\npeople in Empire, State, Province, and Parish, conscription, national\r\nmilitia instead of standing army, international arbitration, abolition\r\nof State religion, free and compulsory education, abolition of capital\r\npunishment, free burial, free medical assistance, free legal advice\r\nand advocacy, progressive succession duties, inheritance tax,\r\nabolition of indirect taxation and customs, parliamentary decisions as\r\nto peace and war, and undenominationalism in schools.\r\n\r\nEspecially for the working classes are intended the following:\r\nNational and international protective legislation for workmen on the\r\nbasis of a normal eight hours day, prohibition of child labour under\r\nfourteen years, prohibition of night work save rendered necessary by\r\nthe nature of the work or the welfare of society, superintendence of\r\nlabour and its relations by a Ministry of Labour, thorough workshop\r\nhygiene, equality of status between the agricultural labourer, servant\r\nclass, and the artisan, right of association, and State insurance, as\r\nto which the working class should have an authoritative voice.\r\n\r\nThe programme contains nothing as to the practical consequences of the\r\nprovisions it contains, but Herr Bebel, in his book on \"Woman and\r\nSocial Democracy,\" gives some examples. One is that the working time\r\nwill be alike for men and women, another that domestic life will be\r\nlimited to the cohabitation of man and woman, for children are to be\r\nbrought up by society, and a third that cooking and washing will be\r\nthe care of central public kitchens and washhouses. Meanwhile, all\r\nthese years, it may be noted, Herr Bebel and his millions of followers\r\nhave been living exactly like everybody else.\r\n\r\nThe student of working-class conditions in Germany is unlikely to\r\nthink clearly unless he distinguishes between such terms as Social\r\nDemocracy, Socialism, Trade Unionism, and Labour party. Social\r\nDemocracy is a species of Socialism. All Social Democrats are\r\nSocialists, but not all Socialists Social Democrats. The latter, as an\r\nenrolled political party, paying annual subscriptions and looking\r\nforward to the future state as conceived by Marx, and now by Bebel,\r\nnumber something under a million; the remaining three millions who\r\nvoted for Social Democratic candidates at the last general election\r\nmay have included men who believe in Social Democratic ideals, but the\r\nvast majority of them, unless one does grave injustice to their common\r\nsense, voted for such candidates owing to dissatisfaction with the\r\npolicy of the Government and present conditions generally--the high\r\ncost of living, the pressure of taxation, the severity of class\r\ndistinctions, and like grievances, real or imaginary. These people are\r\nSocialists in the English or international sense of the word, not\r\nSocial Democrats strictly speaking; and with these people the Emperor\r\nis most angry because he knows they form the element most capable of\r\ndangerous expansion.\r\n\r\nAgain, though the vast majority of German Socialists in the broader\r\nsense are Trade Unionists, not all Trade Unionists are Socialists.\r\nTrade Unionism--the organization of labour against capital--is\r\nrepresented in Germany by two main bodies; the free or Socialist\r\nUnions containing about two million working men, and the \"Christian\"\r\nor loyal \"National\" Unions, which are anti-Social Democrat and\r\nanti-Socialist. These have a membership of about 300,000. The\r\nHirsch-Duncker Unions, with 100,000 members, are Liberal, but also\r\nloyal and anti-Socialist. In labour conflicts, naturally, as\r\ndistinguished from politics, all workmen of the particular branch in\r\nconflict work together, whether they are Socialist or not. It need\r\nonly be added that there is no so-called \"Labour party\" in the German\r\nParliaments. The Social Democratic party in the Reichstag represents\r\nlabour interests generally, and promote them much more insistently and\r\nsuccessfully than they do the Utopia of their dreams.\r\n\r\nBut enough has been said to show the comprehensive and revolutionary\r\nnature of Social Democratic doctrine. The only other feature that\r\nrequires mention in connexion with the movement is the desire on the\r\npart of a section of the party for a revision of its programme. The\r\nparty of revision is usually identified with the names of Heinrich von\r\nVollmar, who first suggested it, and Eduard Bernstein, who is in\r\nfavour of trying to realize that portion of the programme which deals\r\nwith the social needs of the existing generation, the demands of the\r\npresent day, and would leave to posterity the attainment of the final\r\ngoal. The views of the Revisionists differ also from those of the\r\nRadicals in respect of two other main questions which divide the\r\nparty, that of voting budgets and that of going to court. The\r\nRevisionists are willing to do both, and the Radicals to do neither. A\r\ndecisive split in the party is annually looked for, but hitherto, when\r\ncongress-day came, the Revisionists, for the sake of peace and unity\r\nin the party, have refrained from pushing their views to extremes. One\r\nmight suppose that professors of the tenets of Social Democracy would\r\nget into trouble with the police, but they avoid arrest and\r\nimprisonment by taking care to avoid attacking property or the family,\r\nadvocating a republic, or introducing religious questions into their\r\ndiscussions.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the growth of Social Democracy in Germany the\r\nphilosophic historian would doubtless refer to the French Revolution,\r\nor go still farther back to the Reformation, as the starting-point of\r\nevery great change in the views of civilized mankind during the last\r\nfour and a half centuries; but it is with more recent times these\r\npages are chiefly concerned and consequently with causes now\r\noperative. The main specific cause is the change from agriculture to\r\nindustry, and with it the growth of what is generally spoken of as\r\n\"industrialism.\" Industrialism means the assemblage of large masses of\r\nintelligent men forming a community of their own, with its special\r\nconditions and the wants and wishes arising from them. This is the\r\nmost fertile field for Socialism, for a new organization of society.\r\nIn Germany Socialistic ideas kept growing with the increase of\r\nindustrialism, and came to a head with the attempts by Hödel and\r\nNobiling on the life of the Emperor William. The anti-Socialist laws,\r\npassed for a definite period, followed, but they were not renewed; the\r\nEmperor and his Government pressed on instead with a great and\r\nfar-reaching social policy, and Socialism, in the form of Social\r\nDemocracy, freed from restraint, took a new lease of life.\r\n\r\nAnother cause of as general, but less ponderable, a nature is the\r\nremnant of the feudal spirit and feudal manners which lingers in the\r\nattitude of the German governing and official classes towards the rest\r\nof the population. The most objectionable features of the feudal\r\nsystem have passed away, the cruel and exclusive rights and privileges\r\nwhich only men in ignorant personal servitude to an all-powerful\r\nmaster could permanently endure; but traces of the system still exist\r\nin the official attitude towards the public and in the tone of the\r\nofficial communications issued by the administrative services\r\ngenerally. Attitude and tone may be referred in part to the\r\ntraditional character of the Prussian monarchy, which regards the\r\npeople as a flock of sheep, or as a \"talent,\" as the Emperor has\r\ncalled it, entrusted to its care and management by Heaven; but it is\r\nalso due in part to the systematization of public life--and largely of\r\nprivate life--which at times makes the foreigner inclined to think\r\nGermany at once the most Socialistic and at the same time the most\r\ntyrannically ruled country in the world. Everything in Germany must be\r\ndone systematically, and the system must be the result of development.\r\nBut there is no use in having a system unless it is enforced--otherwise\r\nit remains, like Social Democracy, a theory. Compulsion, therefore,\r\nis necessary, and the Government provides it through its official\r\nmachinery and its police. The systematization has enormous public\r\nadvantages, but it is difficult for the Anglo-Saxon, jealous of his\r\nindividual right to direct his public life through his own\r\nrepresentatives and his private life according to his own judgment,\r\nto accommodate himself to a system which seems to him unduly to\r\ninterfere with both right and judgment.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it is the manner in which, under the name of authority,\r\ncompulsion is exercised by subordinate officialdom and in especial by\r\nthe police, as much as the compulsion itself, which irritates in\r\nGermany. Every profession, business, trade, and occupation, down to\r\nthat of selling matches and newspapers in the streets, is meticulously\r\nregulated; and while there is nothing to object to in this, what\r\nstrikes the Anglo-Saxon as objectionable is that the regulations are\r\nenforced with the manners and in the tone of a drill-sergeant. The\r\nofficial in Germany, he finds, is not the servant of the public. There\r\nis a story current in England of a Duke of Norfolk, when\r\nPostmaster-General, going into a district post-office and asking for a\r\npenny stamp. The clerk was dilatory, and the Duke remonstrated. \"Who\r\nare you, I should like to know?\" asked the clerk impertinently, \"that\r\nyou are laying down the law.\" \"I am the public,\" replied the Duke\r\nsimply, at the same time showing the clerk his card. An English\r\nForeign Secretary once told a deputation that the Ministry was\r\n\"waiting for instructions from their employers--the people.\" In\r\nGermany it is the opposite; the official is the master and the public\r\nhis dutiful servant. In Germany the official expects marked deference\r\nfrom the public: the post-office clerk is \"Mr. Official,\" the guardian\r\nof the law \"Mr. Policeman\" (with your hat off). The Anglo-Saxon rather\r\nexpects the deference to be on the other side, and has a sordid\r\nsubconsciousness that he pays the official for his services. Perhaps\r\nthe Social Democrat has something of the same feeling.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief consequences of industrialism in Germany is that the\r\npeople of the country are migrating to the towns. To the country\r\nbumpkin the city is an Eldorado and a lordly pleasure-house. In truth,\r\nhe is much better off in it than in the stagnant life of the country.\r\nIn the city he sees comfort on every hand, with possibilities of\r\nenjoyment of every kind, and if he does not soon get a share of the\r\ngood things going he grows discontented and turns Socialist. In the\r\ncity, too, he learns to think and compare, he perceives the\r\ndistinction of classes and notices that certain classes have open to\r\nthem careers from which he is excluded. Then there is the apparently\r\ninevitable antagonism between labour and capital, between the employer\r\nand employed, which drives the worker to Social Democracy, as offering\r\nthe prospect of his becoming his own master and enjoying the whole\r\nfruits of his labour. He may not know Matthew Arnold's \"Sick King in\r\nBokhara,\" but he would endorse Arnold's lines:--\r\n\r\n     \"And these all, for a lord\r\n     Eat not the fruit of their own hands;\r\n     Which is the heaviest of all plagues\r\n     To that man's mind, who understands.\"\r\n\r\nBut whatever its causes, Social Democracy is one of the most curious\r\nand anomalous societies extant. In a country which worships order, it\r\ncalls for absolute disorder. A revolutionary movement, it anxiously\r\navoids revolution. It is a magnificent organization for no apparent\r\npractical, direct, or immediate purpose. Proclaiming the protection of\r\nthe law and enjoying the blessing of efficient government, it yet\r\nrefuses to vote the budget to pay for them. It supports a large\r\nparliamentary party without any clear or consistent parliamentary\r\npolicy in internal or external affairs, unless to be \"agin the\r\nGovernment\" is a policy. And lastly, if some of its economic demands\r\nare justifiable, and have in several respects been satisfied by modern\r\nlegislation, its fundamental doctrine, the basis of the entire\r\nedifice, is a wild hallucination, sickening to common sense, and\r\ncompletely out of harmony with the progressive economic development of\r\nall nations, including its own.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it may be added that the social side of the Social\r\nDemocracy is perhaps too often unrecognized or ignored by the foreign\r\nobserver. Life for the poorer classes in Germany is apt to be more\r\nmonotonous and dull than for the poorer classes of any country which\r\nnature has blessed with more fertility, more sunshine, more diversity\r\nof hill and dale, and where people are more mutually sociable and\r\naccommodating. Social Democracy offers something by way of remedy to\r\nthis: a field of interest in which the workers can organize and make\r\nprocessions and public demonstrations and can talk and theorize and\r\ndispute, and in which the woman can share the interest with the man;\r\nor a club, a social club with the largest membership in the world\r\nexcept freemasonry.\r\n\r\nWe must return, however, to the Emperor. During this period, in\r\nDecember, 1890, he, like every one else with his own ideas on\r\neducation as well as on art and religion, delivered his views on\r\npopular instruction. At this time--he was then thirty--he called\r\ntogether forty-five of the ablest educational experts of the country\r\nand addressed them on the subject of high-school education. His\r\nMinister of Education, Dr. von Grossler, had drawn up a programme of\r\nfourteen points for discussion, and the Emperor added to these a few\r\nothers he wished to have considered.\r\n\r\nGerman high-school education, be it remarked, is a different thing\r\nfrom English public-school education, and ought rather to be spoken of\r\nas German information than as German education. We have seen that the\r\nspirit of the German university differs largely from that of the\r\nEnglish university, in that it is not concerned with the formation of\r\ncharacter or the inculcation of manners. The same may be said of the\r\nGerman gymnasium, or high school, the institution from which the\r\nGerman youth, as a rule, goes to college. No teaching institution,\r\nEnglish or German, be it further said on our own account, makes any\r\nserious attempt to teach what will prepare youth for intercourse with\r\nthe extremely complicated world of to-day, to give him, to take but\r\none example, the faintest notion of contract, which, if he possessed\r\nit, would save him from many a foolish undertaking and protect him\r\nfrom many a business betrayal, Far from it. All the disagreeable, and\r\nmany of the painful incidents of his subsequent life, all equally\r\navoidable if knowledge regarding them had been instilled into him in\r\nhis early years, he must buy with money and suffering and disgust in\r\nafter-years.\r\n\r\nBut the Emperor is waiting to be heard. His entire speech need not be\r\nquoted, but only its chief contentions. In introducing his remarks he\r\nclaimed to speak with knowledge as having himself sat on a\r\npublic-school bench at Cassel.\r\n\r\nThe Social Democracy being to the Emperor what King Charles's head was\r\nto Mr. Dick, it is not surprising to find almost his first statement\r\nbeing to the effect that if boys had been properly taught up to then,\r\nthere would be no Social Democracy. Up to 1870, he said, the great\r\nsubject of instruction for youth was the necessity for German unity.\r\nUnity had been achieved, the Empire was now founded, and there the\r\nmatter rested. \"Now,\" said the Emperor, \"we must recognize that the\r\nschool is for the purpose of teaching how the Empire is to be\r\nmaintained. I see nothing of such teaching, and I ought to know, for I\r\nam at the head of the Empire, and all such questions come under my\r\nobservation. What,\" he continues,\r\n\r\n     \"is lacking in the education of our youth? The chief fault\r\n     is that since 1870 the philologists have sat in the high\r\n     schools as _beati possidentes_ and laid chief stress upon\r\n     the knowledge to be acquired and not on the formation of\r\n     character and the demands of the present time. Emphasis has\r\n     been put on the ability to know, not on the ability to\r\n     do--the pupil is expected to know, that is the main thing,\r\n     and whether what he knows is suitable for the conduct of\r\n     life or not is considered a secondary matter. I am told the\r\n     school has only to do with the gymnastics of the mind, and\r\n     that a young man, well trained in these gymnastics, is\r\n     equipped for the needs of life. This is all wrong and can't\r\n     go on.\"\r\n\r\nThen the Empire-builder speaks--what is wanted above all is a national\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\n     \"We must make German the foundation for the gymnasium: we\r\n     must produce patriotic young Germans, not young Greeks and\r\n     Romans. We must depart from the centuries-old basis, from\r\n     the old monastic education of the Middle Ages, when Latin\r\n     was the main thing and a tincture of Greek besides. That is\r\n     no longer the standard. German must be the standard. The\r\n     German exercise must be the pivot on which all things turn.\r\n     When in the exit examination (_Abiturientenexamen_) a\r\n     student hands in a German essay, one can judge from it what\r\n     are the mental acquirements of the young man and decide\r\n     whether he is fit for anything or not. Of course people will\r\n     object--the Latin exercise is very important, very good for\r\n     instructing students in other languages, and so on. Yes,\r\n     gentlemen, I have been through the mill. How do we get this\r\n     Latin exercise? I have often seen a young man get, say 4-1/2\r\n     marks, for his German exercise--'satisfactory,' it was\r\n     considered--and 2 for his Latin exercise. The youngster\r\n     deserved punishment instead of praise, because it is clear\r\n     he did not write his Latin exercise in a proper way; and of\r\n     all the Latin exercises we wrote there was not one in a\r\n     dozen which was done without cribbing. These exercises were\r\n     marked 'good,' but when we wrote an essay on 'Minna von\r\n     Barnhelm' (one of Lessing's dramas) we got hardly\r\n     'satisfactory.' So I say, away with the Latin exercise, it\r\n     only harms us, and robs us of time we might give to German.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor goes on to recommend the study of the nation's history,\r\ngeography, and literature (\"Der Sage,\" poetry, he calls it).\r\n\r\n     \"Let us begin at home,\" he says; \"when we have learned\r\n     enough at home, we can go to the museums. But above all we\r\n     must know our German history. In my time the Grand Elector\r\n     was a very foggy personage, the Seven Years' War was quite\r\n     outside consideration, and history ended with the close of\r\n     the last century, the French Revolution. The War of\r\n     Liberation, the most important for the young citizen, was\r\n     not taught thoroughly, and I only learned to know it, thank\r\n     God, through the very interesting lectures of Dr. Hinzpeter.\r\n     This, however, is the _punctum saliens_. Why are our young\r\n     men misled? Why do we find so many unclear, confused\r\n     world-improvers? Why is our government so cavilled at and\r\n     criticized, and so often told to look at foreign nations?\r\n     Because the young men do not know how our conditions have\r\n     developed, and that the roots of the development lie in the\r\n     period of the French Revolution. Consequently, I am\r\n     convinced that if they understood the transition period from\r\n     the Revolution to the nineteenth century in its fundamental\r\n     features, they would have a far better understanding of the\r\n     questions of to-day than they now have. At the universities\r\n     they can supplement their school knowledge.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor then turned to other points. It was \"absolutely necessary\"\r\nto reduce the hours of work. When he was at school, he said, all\r\nGerman parents were crying out against the evil, and the Government\r\nset on foot an inquiry. He and his brother (Henry) had every morning\r\nto hand a memorandum to the head master showing how many hours it had\r\ntaken them to prepare the lessons for the day. In the Emperor's case\r\nit took, \"honestly,\" from 5-1/2 to 7 hours' home study. To this was to\r\nbe added 6 hours in school and 2 hours for eating meals--\"How much of\r\nthe day,\" the Emperor asks, \"was left? If I,\" he said, \"hadn't been\r\nable to ride to and from school I wouldn't have known what the world\r\neven looked like.\" The result of this, he continued, was an\r\n\r\n     \"over-production of educated people, more than the nation\r\n     wanted and more than was tolerable for the sufferers\r\n     themselves. Hence the class Bismarck called the\r\n     abiturienten-proletariat, all the so-called hunger\r\n     candidates, especially the Mr. Journalists, who are often\r\n     broken-down scholars and a danger to us. This surplus, far\r\n     too large as it is, is like an irrigation field that cannot\r\n     soak up any more water, and it must be got rid of.\"\r\n\r\nAnother matter touched on by the Emperor was a reduction in the amount\r\nto be learned, so that more time might be had for the formation of\r\ncharacter. This cannot be done now, he remarks, in a class containing\r\nthirty youngsters, who have such a huge amount of subjects to master.\r\nThe teacher, too, the Emperor said, must learn that his work is not\r\nover when he has delivered his lecture. \"It isn't a matter of\r\nknowledge,\" he concludes \"but a matter of educating the young people\r\nfor the practical affairs of life.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor lastly dealt with the subject of shortsightedness. \"I am\r\nlooking for soldiers,\" he said.\r\n\r\n     \"We need a strong and healthy generation, which will also\r\n     serve the Fatherland as intellectual leaders and officials.\r\n     This mass of shortsightedness is no use, since a man who\r\n     can't use his eyes--how can he do anything later?\"\r\n\r\nand he went on to mention the extraordinary facts that in some of the\r\nprimary classes of German schools as many as 74 per cent, were\r\nshortsighted, and that in his class at Cassel, of the twenty-one\r\npupils, eighteen wore spectacles, while two of them could not see the\r\ndesk before them without their glasses.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman in Germany often attributes German shortsightedness to\r\nthe Gothic character of German print. It is more probable that the\r\nlong hours of study spent poring over books without fresh-air\r\nexercise, judiciously interposed, is responsible for it.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that every one, like the Emperor, has his own theory\r\nof education, but there is one passage in the Emperor's speech with\r\nwhich almost all men will agree--that, namely, in which he urges that\r\nknowledge is not the only--perhaps not the chief--thing, but that\r\nyoung people must be educated for the practical affairs of life.\r\nUnfortunately, as to how we are successfully to do this, the Emperor\r\nis silent; and it may be that there is no certain or exact way. One\r\ncould, of course--but we are concerned with the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe difference of opinion between the Emperor and Bismarck regarding\r\nthe Emperor's visit to Russia seems to have left no permanent ill-will\r\nin the Emperor's mind, for on returning in October, 1889, from visits\r\nto Athens, where he attended the wedding of his sister Sophie with the\r\nHeir-Apparent of Greece, Prince Constantine (now King Constantine),\r\nand Constantinople, where he was allowed to inspect the Sultan's\r\nseraglio, he sent a letter to the Chancellor praying God to grant that\r\nthe latter's \"faithful and experienced counsel might for many years\r\nassist him in his difficult and responsible office.\" In January, 1890,\r\nhowever, the question of renewing the Socialist Laws, which would\r\nexpire shortly, came up for settlement. A council of Ministers, under\r\nthe Emperor's presidency, was called to decide it. When the council\r\nmet, Bismarck was greatly surprised by a proposal of the Emperor to\r\nissue edicts developing the principles laid down by his grandfather\r\nfor working-class reform instead of renewing the Socialist Laws. The\r\nReichstag took the Emperor's view and voted against the renewal of the\r\nLaws. It only now remained to give effect to the Emperor's edicts.\r\nThey were considered at a further council of Ministers, at which the\r\nEmperor exhorted them to \"leave the Social Democracy to me, I can\r\nmanage them alone.\" The Ministers agreed, and Bismarck was in a\r\nminority of one. This, however, was only the beginning of the end.\r\nBismarck decided to continue in office until he had carried through\r\nParliament a new military Bill, which was to come before it in May or\r\nJune. Meanwhile fresh matters of controversy between the Emperor and\r\nthe Chancellor arose regarding the grant of imperial audiences to\r\nMinisters other than the Chancellor. Bismarck insisted that the\r\nChancellor alone had the right to be received by the Emperor for the\r\ndiscussion of State affairs.\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was accentuated by a lively scene which occurred between\r\nthe Emperor and the Chancellor about this period in connexion with a\r\nvisit the leader of the Catholic Centre party had paid the Chancellor,\r\nand on March 17th the Emperor sent his chief Adjutant, General von\r\nHahnke, to say he awaited the Chancellor's resignation. Bismarck\r\nreplied that to resign at this juncture would be an act of desertion;\r\nthe Emperor could dismiss him. At the same time the Chancellor\r\nsummoned a meeting of Ministers for the afternoon, but while they were\r\ndiscussing the situation a message was brought from the Emperor\r\ntelling them he did not require their advice in such a matter and that\r\nhe had made up his mind about the Chancellor. The messenger on the\r\nsame occasion expressed to Bismarck the Emperor's surprise at not\r\nhaving received a formal resignation. Bismarck's reply was that it\r\nwould require some days to prepare such a document, as it was the last\r\nofficial statement of a \"Minister who had played a meritorious part in\r\nthe history of Prussia and Germany, and history should know why he had\r\nbeen dismissed.\" Three days later, on March 20th, an hour or two after\r\nthe formal resignation reached the palace, the Emperor's letter\r\ngranting the Chancellor's request for his release, naming him Duke of\r\nLauenburg and announcing the appointment of General von Caprivi as his\r\nsuccessor, was put into the old Chancellor's hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COURT OF THE EMPEROR\r\n\r\nWhile the ex-Chancellor is bitterly meditating on the unreliability\r\nand ingratitude of princes, yet having in his heart, as the records\r\nclearly show, the loyal sentiments of a Cardinal Wolsey towards his\r\nroyal master, even though that master had cast him off, we may be\r\nallowed to pause awhile in order to give some account of the Court of\r\nwhich the Emperor now became the centre and pivot.\r\n\r\nHuman imagination, in its worship of force as the source of ability to\r\nachieve the ends of ambition and desire, very early conceived the\r\ncourts of kings as fairylands of power, wealth, luxury, and\r\nmagnificence--in a word, of happiness. The same imagination represents\r\nthe Almighty, whose true nature no one knows, as a monarch in the\r\nbright court of heaven, and his great antagonist, Satan, who stands\r\nfor the king of evil, is enthroned by it amid the shades of hell. The\r\nfiction that courts are a species of earthly paradise is still kept up\r\nfor the entertainment of children; while the adult, whom the annals of\r\nall countries has made familiar with a long record of monarchs, bad as\r\nwell as good, is disposed to regard them as beneficial or otherwise to\r\na country according to the character and conduct of the occupant of\r\nthe throne, and to believe that they are at least as liable to produce\r\nexamples of vice and hypocrisy as of virtue and honesty.\r\n\r\nThe court of the German Emperor in this connexion need not fear\r\ncomparison with any court described in history. True, courts all over\r\nthe world have improved wonderfully of recent years. Their monarchs\r\nare more enlightened, they are frequented by a very different type of\r\nman and woman from the courts of former times, their morale and\r\nworking are more closely scrutinized and more generally subjected to\r\ncriticism, and they are occupied with a more public and less selfish\r\norder of considerations. The Court of the Emperor is, so far as can be\r\nknown to a lynx-eyed and not always charitably thinking public,\r\nsingularly free from the vices and failings the atmosphere of former\r\ncourts was wont to foster. There is at all times, no doubt, the\r\ncompetition of politicians for influence and power acting and reacting\r\non the Court and its frequenters, but of scandal at the Court of\r\nBerlin there has been none that could be fairly said to involve the\r\nEmperor or his family. Dame Gossip, of course, busied herself with the\r\nEmperor in his youth, but whatever truth she then uttered--and it is\r\nprobably extremely little--on this head, there is no question that\r\nfrom the day he mounted the throne his Court and that of the Empress\r\nhas been a model for all institutions of the kind.\r\n\r\nThe life of courts, the personages who play leading parts in them,\r\ntheir wealth and luxury, and the currents of social, amorous, and\r\npolitical intrigue which are supposed to course through them have in\r\nall countries and in all ages strongly appealed to writers, fanciful\r\nand serious. Perhaps one-third of the prose and poetic literature of\r\nevery country deals, directly or indirectly, with the subject, and\r\ndetermines in no small degree the character of its rising generations.\r\nThe great architects of romance, depicting for us life in high places,\r\nand often nobly idealizing it, or working the facts of history into\r\nthe web of their imaginings and thus pleasantly combining fact with\r\nfiction, aim at elevating, not at debasing, the mind of the reader. A\r\nsecond valuable source of information on the topic are the memoirs of\r\nthose who have set down their observations and recorded experiences\r\nmade in the courts to which they had access. Among this class,\r\nhowever, are to be found unscrupulous as well as conscientious\r\nauthors, the former obviously cherishing some personal grievance or as\r\nobviously actuated by malice, while the latter are usually moved by an\r\nhonest desire to tell the world things that are important for it to\r\nknow, and at the same time, it is not ill-natured to suspect, enhance\r\ntheir own reputation with their contemporaries or with posterity. The\r\nmultitudinous tribe of anecdote inventors and retailers must also be\r\ntaken into account. In our own day there is still another source of\r\ninformation, which, agreeably or odiously according to the temperament\r\nof the reader, keeps us in touch with courts and what goes on\r\nthere--the periodical press; while afar off in the future one can\r\nimagine the historian bent over his desk, surrounded by books and\r\nknee-deep in newspapers, selecting and weighing events, studying\r\ncharacters, developing personalities, and passing what he hopes may be\r\na final judgment on the court and period he is considering.\r\n\r\nFor a study of the Emperor's life, as it passes in his Court, a large\r\nnumber of works are available, but not many that can be described as\r\nauthoritative or reliable. Among the latter, however, may be placed\r\nMoritz Busch's \"Bismarck: Some Secret Pages of His History,\" three\r\nvolumes that make Busch almost as interesting to the reader as his\r\nsubject; Bismarck's own \"Gedanke und Erinnerungen,\" which is chiefly\r\nof a political nature; and the \"Memorabilia of Prince Chlodwig\r\nHohenlohe-Schillingsfürst,\" who was for several years Statthalter of\r\nAlsace-Lorraine and subsequently became Imperial Chancellor in\r\nsuccession to General von Caprivi. These works, with the collections\r\nof the Emperor's speeches and the speeches and interviews of\r\nChancellor Prince von Bülow, may be ranked in the category of serious\r\nand authentic contributions to the Court history of the period they\r\ncover. Then there are several German descriptions of the Court,\r\nreliable enough in their way which is a dull one, to those who are not\r\nimpassioned monarchists or hide-bound bureaucrats. In the category of\r\nworks by unscrupulous writers that entitled \"The Private Lives of\r\nWilliam II and His Consort,\" by a lady-in-waiting to the Empress from\r\n1888 to 1898, easily takes first place. Certainly it gives a lively\r\nand often entertaining insight into the domestic life of the palace,\r\nbut it is so clearly informed by spite that it is impossible to\r\ndistinguish what is true in it from what is false or misrepresented.\r\nFinally, for the closer study of individual events and the impressions\r\nthey made at the time of their happening, the daily press can be\r\nconsulted. For the Bismarck period the biography of Hans Blum is of\r\nexceptional value.\r\n\r\nWhat may be termed the anecdotic literature of the Court is\r\nparticularly rich and trivial, and this is only to be expected in a\r\ncountry where the monarchy and its representative are so forcibly and\r\nconstantly brought home to the people's consciousness. Yet it has its\r\nuses, and is referred to, though sparingly, in the present work. \"The\r\nEmperor as Father of a Family,\" \"The Emperor and His Daughter's\r\nUniform,\" \"The Amiable Grandfather,\" \"The Emperor as Husband,\" \"The\r\nEmperor as Card Player,\" \"How the Emperor's Family is Photographed,\"\r\n\"What does the Emperor's Kitchen Look Like,\" \"Adieu, Auguste\"\r\n(\"Auguste\" is the Empress), \"The English Lord and the Emperor's\r\nCigarettes,\" \"When My Wife Makes You a Sandwich,\" \"What the Emperor\r\nReads,\" \"The Emperor's Handwriting,\" \"Can the Emperor Vote?\" (the\r\nanswer is, opinions differ), \"Washing Day at the Emperor's,\" \"The\r\nEmperor and the Empress at Tennis,\" \"Emperor and Auto,\" are the sort\r\nof matters dealt with. Literature of this kind is beyond question\r\nintensely interesting to vast numbers of people, but helps very little\r\ntowards understanding a singularly complex human being placed in a\r\nhigh and extraordinarily responsible position.\r\n\r\nStrictly speaking, there is no Imperial Court in Germany, since the\r\nKing of Prussia, in accordance with the Imperial Constitution, always\r\nsucceeds to the imperial throne, and therefore officially the Court is\r\nthat of the King of Prussia only. The distinction is emphasized by the\r\nfact that the Court is independent of the Empire as regards its\r\nadministration and finance. It is a state within a state, an _imperium\r\nin imperio_. In all that pertains to it the Emperor is absolute ruler\r\nand his executive is a special Ministry. At the same time it is almost\r\nneedless to add that the Court of Berlin is practically that of the\r\nEmpire. It is this character, apart from Prussia's size and\r\nimportance, that distinguishes it from other courts in Germany and\r\nreduces them to comparative insignificance in foreign, though by no\r\nmeans in German, consideration.\r\n\r\nThe Court of the Empire and Prussia--and the same thing may be said of\r\nthe various other courts in Germany--engages popular interest and\r\nattention to a much larger extent than is the case in England. The\r\nfact is almost wholly due to the nature of the monarchy and of its\r\nrelations to the people. In England a great portion of the popular\r\nattention is concentrated on Parliament and the fortunes of its two\r\ngreat political parties. The attention given to the Court and its\r\ndoings is not of the same general and permanent character, but is\r\nintermittent according to the occasion. The Englishman feels deep and\r\nabiding popular interest at all times in Parliament, whether in\r\nsession or not, because it represents the people and is, in fact, and\r\nfor hundreds of years has been, the Government.\r\n\r\nThe reverse may fairly be said to be the case in Germany. In Germany\r\npopular attention has been from early times concentrated on the\r\nmonarch, his personality, sayings and doings, since in his hands lay\r\ngovernment power and patronage. Monarchy of a more or less absolute\r\ncharacter was accepted by the people, not only in Germany but all over\r\nthe Continent, as the normal and desirable, perhaps the inevitable,\r\nstate of things; and it is only since the French Revolution that\r\nparliaments after the English pattern, that is by two chambers elected\r\nby popular vote, yet in many important respects widely differing from\r\nit, were demanded by the people or finally established. Up to\r\ncomparatively recent times the monarch in Prussia was an absolute\r\nruler. Frederick William IV, after the events of 1848, was compelled\r\nto grant Prussia a Constitution which explicitly defined the\r\nrespective rights of the Crown and the people in the sphere of\r\npolitics; and the Imperial Constitution, drawn up on the formation of\r\nthe modern Empire, did the same thing as regards the Emperor and the\r\npeople of the Empire; but neither Constitution altered the nature of\r\nthe monarchy in the direction of giving governing power to the people.\r\nBoth secured the people legislative, but not governing power.\r\nGovernment in the Empire and Prussia remains, as of old, an appanage,\r\nso to speak, of the Court, and the fact of course tends to concentrate\r\nattention on the Court.\r\n\r\nIt has been said that the Court is a state within a state, an\r\n_imperium in imperio_. In this state, within Prussia or within the\r\nEmpire, it is the same thing for our purpose, there are two main\r\ndepartments, that of the Lord Chamberlain (_Oberstkammeramt_) and that\r\nof the Master of the Household (_Ministerium des Königlichen Hauses_).\r\nThe first deals with all questions of court etiquette, court\r\nceremonial, court mourning, precedence, superintendence of the courts\r\nof the Emperor's sons and near relatives, and of all Prussian court\r\noffices. The second deals with the personal affairs of the Emperor and\r\nhis sons, the domestic administration of the palace, the management of\r\nthe Crown estates and castles, and is the tribunal that decides all\r\nHohenzollern differences and disputes that are not subject to the\r\nordinary legal tribunals. Connected with this Ministry are the\r\nHerald's office and the Court Archives office. The chief Court\r\nofficials include, beside the Lord Chamberlain and the Master of the\r\nHousehold, a Chief Court Marshal. The Master of the Household is also\r\nChief Master of Ceremonies, with a Deputy Master of Ceremonies who is\r\nalso Introducer of Ambassadors, two Court Marshals, a Captain of the\r\nPalace Guards, a Court Chaplain, Court Physician, an Intendant in\r\ncharge of the royal theatres, a Master of the Horse who has charge of\r\nthe royal stables, a House Marshal, and a Master of the Kitchen. All\r\nthese officials are princes (_Fürst_) or counts (_Graf_), with the\r\ntitle Highness (_Durchlaucht_) or Excellency.\r\n\r\nCourt officials also include the various nobles in charge of the royal\r\npalaces, castles, and hunting lodges at Potsdam, Charlottenburg,\r\nBreslau, Stettin, Marienburg, Posen, Letzlingen, Hohkönigsberg,\r\nHomberg von der Höhe, Springe, Hubertusstock, Rominten, Korfu (the\r\n\"Achilleion\"), Wiesbaden, Koenigsberg, etc., to the number of thirty\r\nor more. The Empress has her own Court officials, including a Mistress\r\nof the Robes and Ladies of the Bedchamber, also with the title of\r\nExcellency, the Ladies being chosen from the most aristocratic\r\nfamilies of Germany. The Empress has her own Master of the Household,\r\nphysician, treasurer, and so on. Similarly with the households of the\r\nCrown Prince, other royal princes and the Emperor's near relatives.\r\n\r\nEvery order the Emperor gives that is not of a purely domestic kind\r\npasses through one of his three cabinets--the Civil Cabinet, the\r\nMilitary Cabinet, or the Marine Cabinet. The cost of the first, with\r\nits chief, who receives £1,000 a year, and half a dozen subordinate\r\nofficials on salaries of £200 to £350, is budgeted at about £10,000 a\r\nyear. The Military Cabinet is a much larger establishment, having\r\nseveral departments and a staff of half a hundred councillors and\r\nclerks. The Naval Cabinet, on the other hand, is composed of only\r\nthree upper officials and five clerks. The Emperor's \"civil list\" is\r\nreturned in the Budget as £860,000 roughly. His entire annual revenue\r\ndoes not exceed £1,000,000. Out of this he has to pay the expenses of\r\nhis married sons' households and make large contributions to public\r\ncharities. He was left, however, a very considerable sum of money by\r\nthe Emperor William. The Crown Prince, as such, receives a grant of\r\n£20,000 a year, chiefly derived from the royal domain of Oels in\r\nSilesia. Like all fathers of large families, the Emperor has been more\r\nthan once heard to complain that he finds it difficult to make both\r\nends meet.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's staff of adjutants are exceptionally useful and\r\nimportant people. At their head is the chief of the Emperor's Military\r\nCabinet. Not less important are the members of the Emperor's Marine\r\nCabinet, consisting of admirals, vice-admirals, and wing-admirals. The\r\npersonal adjutants divide the day and night service between them, so\r\nthat there may always be three adjutants at the Emperor's immediate\r\ndisposal. The adjutant announces Ministers or other visitors to the\r\nEmperor, telegraphs to say that His Majesty has an hour or an hour and\r\na half at his disposal at such-and-such a time, or intimates that an\r\naudience of half an hour can be given in the train between two given\r\npoints. They act as living memorandum books, knock at the Emperor's\r\ndoor to announce that it is time for him to go to this or that\r\nappointment, remind him that a congratulatory telegram on some one's\r\nseventieth birthday or other jubilee has to be sent, or perhaps\r\nwhispers that Her Majesty the Empress wishes to see him. All the\r\nEmperor's correspondence passes through their hands. They accompany\r\nthe Emperor on his journeys and voyages, and when thus employed are\r\nusually invited to his table. The Emperor reads of some new book and\r\ntells an adjutant to order it, and the latter does so by communicating\r\nwith the Civil Cabinet.\r\n\r\nCourt society in Berlin includes the German \"higher\" and \"lower\"\r\nnobility, with the exception of the so-called Fronde, who proudly\r\nabsent themselves from it; the Ministers; the diplomatic corps; Court\r\nofficials; and such members of the burghertum, or middle class, as\r\nhold offices which entitle them to attend court. The wives, however,\r\nof those in the last category are not \"court-capable\" on this account,\r\nnor is the middle class generally, nor even members of the Imperial or\r\nPrussian Parliaments as such. Members of Parliament are invited to the\r\nCourt's seasonal festivities, but as a rule only members of the\r\nConservative parties or other supporters of the Government. The\r\nnobility, as in England, is hereditary or only nominated for life, and\r\nthe hereditary nobility is divided into an upper and lower class. To\r\nthe former belongs members of houses that were ruling when the modern\r\nEmpire was established, and, while excluding the Emperor, who stands\r\nabove them, includes sovereign houses and mediatized houses. Some of\r\nthe ancient privileges of the nobility, such as exemption from\r\ntaxation, and the right to certain high offices, have been abolished,\r\nbut in practice the nobility still occupy the most important charges\r\nin the administration and in the army. The privileges of the\r\nmediatized princes consist of exemption from conscription, the\r\nenjoyment of the Principle called \"equality of birth,\" which prevents\r\nthe burgher wife of a noble acquiring her husband's rank, and the\r\nright to have their own \"house law\" for the regulation of family\r\ndisputes and family affairs generally. No increase to the high\r\nnobility of Germany can accrue as no addition will ever be made to the\r\nonce sovereign and mediatized families. With the exception of these\r\nhouses the rest of the German nobility, hereditary and non-hereditary,\r\nis accounted as belonging to the lower nobility. That part of the\r\nGerman aristocracy who refuse to go to court, and are accordingly\r\ncalled by the name Fronde, first given to the opponents of Cardinal\r\nMazarin, in the reign of Louis XIV, consist chiefly of a few old\r\nfamilies of Prussian Poland, Hannover (the Guelphs), Brunswick,\r\nNassau, Hessen, and other annexed German territories, and of some\r\ngreat Catholic houses in Bavaria and the Rhineland. Their dislike is\r\ndirected not so much against the Empire as against Prussia. The\r\nKulturkampf had the effect of setting a small number of ancient\r\nPrussian ultramontane families against the Government.\r\n\r\nNot much that is complimentary can be said of the German aristocracy\r\nas a whole. \"Serenissimus\" is to-day as frequently the subject of\r\nbitter, if often humorous, caricature in the comic press as ever he\r\nwas. A few of the class, like Prince Fürstenberg, Prince Hohenlohe,\r\nCount Henkel-Donnersmarck and some others engage successfully in\r\ncommerce; many are practical farmers and have done a good deal for\r\nagriculture; several are deputies to Parliament; but on the whole the\r\nforeigner gets the impression that the class as such contributes but a\r\nsmall percentage of what it might and should in the way of brains,\r\nindustry, or example to the welfare and the progress of the Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to communicate an impression of the Court, whether at\r\nthe Schloss in Berlin or the New Palace in Potsdam, and at the same\r\ntime avoid the dry and dusty descriptions of the guide-books. If the\r\nreader is not in Berlin, let him imagine the fragment of a mediæval\r\ntown, situated on a river and fronted by a bridge; and on the bank of\r\nthe river a dark, square, massive and weather-stained pile of four\r\nstories, with barred windows on the ground floor as defence against a\r\npossibly angry populace, and a sentry-box at each of its two lofty\r\nwrought-iron gates. It may be, as Baedeker informs us it is, a\r\n\"handsome example of the German renaissance,\" but to the foreigner it\r\ncan as equally suggest a large and grimy barracks as the\r\nfive-hundred-years-old palace of a long line of kings and emperors.\r\nAnd yet, to any one acquainted with the blood-stained annals of\r\nPrussian history, who knows something of the massive stone buildings\r\nabout it and of the people who have inhabited them, who strolls\r\nthrough its interior divided into sombre squares, each with its cold\r\nand bare parade-ground, who reflects on the relations between king and\r\npeople, closely identified by their historical associations, yet\r\nsundered by the feudal spirit which still keeps the Crown at a\r\ndistance from the crowd, above all to the German versed in his\r\ncountry's story--how eloquently it speaks!\r\n\r\nWhen one thinks of the Court of Berlin one should not forget that the\r\nNew Palace, the Emperor's residence at Potsdam, sixteen miles distant\r\nfrom the capital, is as much, and as important, a part of it as the\r\nroyal palace in Berlin itself. The Emperor divides his time between\r\nthem, the former, when he is not travelling, being his more permanent\r\nresidence, and the latter only claiming his presence during the winter\r\nseason and for periods of a day or so at other parts of the year, when\r\noccasion requires it. It is only during the six or eight weeks of the\r\nwinter season that the Empress and her daughter, Princess Victoria\r\nLouise (now Duchess of Brunswick), go into residence at the Berlin\r\nroyal palace. There is a railway between Potsdam and Berlin, but since\r\nthe introduction of the motor-car the Emperor almost always uses that\r\nmeans of conveyance for the half-hour's run between his Berlin and\r\nPotsdam palaces.\r\n\r\nThe other section of the Court, if Potsdam may be so described, is\r\nhardly less rich in memories than the old palace by the Spree. Indeed\r\nit is richer from the cosmopolitan point of view, for though Frederick\r\nthe Great was born in the Berlin Schloss and spent some of his time\r\nthere, it was at Potsdam that, when not campaigning, he may be said to\r\nhave lived and died. To this day, for the foreigner, his personality\r\nstill pervades the place, and that of the Emperor sinks,\r\ncomparatively, into the background. The tourist who has pored over his\r\nBaedeker will learn that Potsdam has 53,000 inhabitants and is\r\n\"charmingly situated\"--it depends on your temperament what the charm\r\nis, and to guide-book framers all tourists have the same\r\ntemperament--on an island in the Havel \"which here expands into a\r\nseries of lakes bounded by wooded hills.\" He will learn that the old\r\ntown-palace, which few visitors give a thought to, was built by the\r\nGreat Elector, that Frederick the Great lived here in \"richly\r\ndecorated apartments with sumptuous furniture and noteworthy pictures\r\nby Pater, Lancret, and Pesne\"; that it contains a cabinet in which the\r\ndining-table could be let up and down by means of a trap-door, and\r\n\"where the King occasionally dined with friends without risk of being\r\noverheard by his attendants\"; that the present Emperor, then Prince\r\nWilliam, lived here with his young wife when he was still only a\r\nlieutenant. He will drive to the New Palace--now old, for it was built\r\nby Frederick the Great in 1769, during the Seven Years' War, at a cost\r\nof nearly half a million sterling--and gaze with interest at the\r\nsummer residence of the Emperor. If he is an American he may think of\r\nhis multi-millionaire fellow-citizen, Cornelius Vanderbilt, who, when\r\ndriving up to call on his erstwhile imperial schoolfellow and friend,\r\nwas nearly shot at by a sentry for whom the name Vanderbilt was no\r\n\"Open Sesame.\" He will see before him a main building, seven hundred\r\nfeet in length, three stories high, with the central portion\r\nsurmounted by a dome, its chief façade looking towards a park. The\r\nwhole, of course--for Baedeker is talking--forms an \"imposing pile,\"\r\nwith \"mediocre sculptures, but the effect of the weathered sandstone\r\nfigures against the red brick is very pleasing.\" Here the Emperor's\r\nfather, Frederick III, was born, lived as Crown Prince, reigned for\r\nninety-nine days, and died. Here, too, are more \"apartments of\r\nFrederick the Great,\" with pictures by Rubens, including an \"Adoration\r\nof the Magi,\" a good example of Watteau and a portrait of Voltaire\r\ndrawn by Frederick's own hand. In the north wing are situated the\r\npresent Emperor's suite of chambers, where distinguished men of all\r\ncountries have discussed almost every conceivable topic, political,\r\nsocial, religious, martial, artistic, financial, and commercial, with\r\none of the most interesting talkers of his time. No bloody tragedy has\r\ndefiled the palace, as did the murder of Lord Darnley at Holyrood,\r\nthat of the Duke of Guise (Sir Walter Scott's \"Le Balafré\") the\r\nchateau of Blois, the execution of the Bourbon Duc d'Enghien the\r\npalace of Vincennes, or the murder of the boy princes the Tower of\r\nLondon. But bloodless tragedy, and exquisite comedy, and farce too,\r\nhave doubtless had their hour within the walls. One such incident of\r\nthe politico-tragic kind was that which passed only two years ago\r\nbetween the Emperor and his Imperial Chancellor, when Prince von Bülow\r\nwent as deputy from the Federal Council, the Parliament, and the\r\npeople to pray the Emperor to exercise more caution in his public, or\r\nsemi-public statements; and the historian may possibly find another,\r\nand not without its touch of comedy, in the reception by the Emperor\r\nof the Chinese prince, who headed the \"mission of atonement\" for the\r\nmurder of the Emperor's Minister in Pekin during the Boxer troubles.\r\n\r\nFrom the New Palace our foreigner will probably drive to the Marble\r\nPalace, which (for Baedeker is ever at one's elbow with the facts) he\r\nwill mark was built in 1796 by Frederick William II, who died here,\r\nwas completed in 1845 by Frederick William IV, and was the residence\r\nof the present Emperor at the time of his accession.\r\n\r\nBut while our foreigner has been hurrying from one palace to another,\r\nwith his mind in a fog of historical and topographical confusion--if\r\nhe is an American, half-hoping, half-expecting to meet the Emperor or\r\nEmpress and secure a bow from one or other, or--why not?--one of\r\nWilliam's well-known vigorous _poignées de main_, there is always one\r\nthought predominant in his mind--Sans Souci. That is the real object\r\nof his quest, the main attraction that has brought him, all\r\nunconscious of it, to Berlin, and not the laudable, but wholly\r\nmistaken efforts of the \"Society for the Promotion of Tourist\r\nTraffic,\" which seeks to lure the moneyed and reluctant foreigner to\r\nthe German capital. Our foreigner enters the Park of Sans Souci and\r\nhis spirit is at rest. Now he knows where he really is--not in the\r\nwonderful new German Empire, not in modern Berlin with its splendid\r\nand to him unspeaking streets, its garish \"night-life,\" its\r\nfaultily-faultless municipal propriety, not in Potsdam, \"the true\r\ncradle of the Prussian army,\" as Baedeker, deviating for an instant\r\ninto metaphor, describes it, but simply in Sans Souci. He is now no\r\nlonger in the twentieth century, but the eighteenth--one hundred and\r\nfifty years ago or more--in Frederick's day, the period of pigtails,\r\nof giant grenadiers in the old-time blue and red coats, the high and\r\nfantastic shako made of metal and tapering to a point, of\r\nthree-cornered hats resting on powdered wigs, of yellow top-boots, and\r\nexhaling the general air of ruffianly geniality characteristic of the\r\nmanners and soldiers of the age.\r\n\r\nAs our foreigner advances through the park, where, as he is told, the\r\nEmperor makes a promenade each Christmas Eve distributing ten-mark\r\npieces (spiteful chroniclers make it three marks) to all and sundry\r\npoor, he will notice the fountain \"the water of which rises to a\r\nheight of 130 feet,\" with its twelve figures by French artists of the\r\neighteenth century, and ascend the broad terraced flight of marble\r\nsteps up which the present Crown Prince is credited with once urging\r\nhis trembling steed--leading to the Mecca of his imagination, the\r\npalace Sans Souci itself. The building is only one story high, not\r\nlarge, reminding one somewhat of the Trianon at Versailles, though\r\nlacking the Trianon's finished lightness and elegance, yet with its\r\nsemicircular colonnade distinctly French, and impressive by its\r\nelevated situation. The chief, the enduring, the magical impression,\r\nhowever, begins to form as our foreigner commences his pilgrimage\r\nthrough the rooms in which Frederick passed most of his later years.\r\nAs he pauses in the Voltaire Chamber he imagines the two great\r\nfigures, seated in stiff-backed chairs at a little table on which\r\nstand, perhaps, a pair of cut Venetian wine-glasses and a tall bottle\r\nof old Rheinish--the great man of thought and the great man of action,\r\nthe two great atheists and freethinkers of Europe, with their earnest,\r\nsharply featured faces, and their wigs bobbing at each other,\r\ndiscussing the events and tendencies of their time. And how they must\r\nhave talked--no wonder Frederick, though the idol of his subjects,\r\nwithdrew for such discourse from the society of the day, with its\r\ntwaddle of the tea-cups and its parade-ground platitudes.\r\n\r\nAs in our own time, there was then no lack of stimulating topics. The\r\ninfluence of the old Catholicism and the old feudalism was rapidly\r\ndiminishing, the night of superstition was passing, and the age of\r\nreason, that was to culminate with such tremendous and horrible force\r\nin the French Revolution, was beginning to dawn. The encyclopaedists,\r\nwith Diderot and d'Alembert in the van, were holding council in\r\nFrance, mobilizing the intellects of the time, and, like Bacon, taking\r\nall knowledge for their province, for a fierce attack on the old\r\nphilosophy, the old statecraft, the old art, and the old religion. Are\r\nsuch topics and such men to deal with them to be found to-day, or have\r\nall the great problems of humanity and its intellect been started,\r\nstudied, and resolved? And are motor-cars, aeroplanes, dances,\r\nDreadnoughts, millinery, rag-time reviews, auction bridge, the rise\r\nand fall of stocks, and the last extraordinary round of golf, all that\r\nis left for the present generation to discuss?\r\n\r\nHowever, the guardian of the palace has moved on, the other members of\r\nthe party are getting bored, and our foreigner follows the guardian's\r\nlead. Thus conducted, he passes through half a dozen rooms, each a\r\nmuseum of historical associations--the dining-room with its round\r\ntable made famous by Menzel's picture (now in the Berlin National\r\nGallery) in which Frederick and his guests are seen seated, but in\r\nwhich it is difficult if not impossible to be certain which is the\r\nhost; the concert-room with the clock which Frederick was in the habit\r\nof winding up, and which \"is said to have stopped at the precise\r\nmoment of his death, 2.20 a.m., August 17th, 1786\"; the death-chamber\r\nwith its eloquent and pathetic statue, Magnussen's \"Last Moments of\r\nFrederick the Great\"; the library and picture gallery. Strangely\r\nenough, Baedeker has no mention of a female subject portrayed in the\r\nconcert-room in all sorts of attitudes and in all sorts and no sort of\r\ncostume. Yet every one has heard of La Barberini, the only woman, the\r\nchroniclers (and Voltaire among them) assure us, Frederick ever loved.\r\nShe was no woman of birth or wit like the Pompadour, Récamier or\r\nStaël, but of merely ordinary understanding and the wife of a\r\nsubordinate official of the Court. She charmed Frederick, however, and\r\nmay have loved him. If so, let us remember that the morals of those\r\ndays were not those of ours, and not grudge the lonely King his\r\nenjoyment of her beauty and amiability.\r\n\r\nOne thing only remains for our foreigner to see--the coffin of\r\nFrederick in the old Garrison Church. It lies in a small chamber\r\nbehind the pulpit and looks more like the strong box of a miser than\r\nthe last resting-place of a great king. For such a man it seems poor\r\nand mean, but probably Frederick himself did not wish for better. He\r\nmust have known that his real monument would be his reputation with\r\nposterity. In fact the chroniclers agree, and the noble statue of\r\nMagnussen confirms the impression, that at the close of his stormy\r\nlife he was glad finally to be at rest anywhere. \"_Quand je serai\r\nlà_,\" he was wont to say, pointing to where his dogs were buried in\r\nthe palace park, \"_je serai sans souci_.\"\r\n\r\nIn every court there is a disposition on the part of courtiers to\r\nagree with everything the monarch says, to flatter him as dexterously\r\nas they can, to minister to princely vanity, if vanity there be, to\r\n\"crawl on their bellies,\" in the choice language of hostile court\r\ncritics, or \"wag their tails\" and double up their bodies at every bow;\r\nshow, in short, in different ways, often all unconsciously, the\r\npresence of a servile and self-interested mind. The disposition is not\r\nto be found in courts alone. It is one of the commonest and most\r\nmalignant qualities of humanity, and can any day and at any hour be\r\nobserved in action in any Ministry of State, any mercantile office,\r\nany great warehouse, any public institution, in every scene, in fact,\r\nwhere one or many men are dependent for their living on the favour or\r\ncaprice of another. On the other hand, let it not be forgotten that\r\nthis innate tendency of human nature is at times replaced by another\r\nwhich has frequently the same outward manifestations, but is not the\r\nsame feeling, the sentiment, namely, of embarrassment arising from the\r\nfear of being servile, and the equally frequent embarrassment arising\r\nfrom that principle which is always at work in the mind, the\r\nassociation of ideas, which in the case of a monarch presents him to\r\nthe ordinary mortal as embodying ideas of grandeur, power, might, and\r\nintellect to which the latter is unaccustomed. Education, economic\r\nchanges, and the art of manners have done much to conceal, if not\r\neradicate, human proneness to servility, and the Byzantinism of the\r\ntime of Caligula and Nero, of Tiberius, Constantine, or Nikiphoros, of\r\nthe Stuarts and the Bourbons, has long been modified into respect for\r\noneself as well as for the person one addresses. There are, however,\r\nstill traces of the old evil in the German atmosphere, and in especial\r\na tendency among officials of all grades to be humble and submissive\r\nto those above them and haughty and domineering to those below them.\r\nThe tendency is perhaps not confined to Germany, but it seems, to the\r\ninhabitant of countries where bureaucracy is not a powerful caste, to\r\npenetrate German society and ordinary life to a greater degree--yet\r\nnot to a great degree--than in more democratic societies.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor naturally knows nothing of such a thing, for there is no\r\none superior to him in the Empire in point of rank, and he is much too\r\nmodern, too well educated, and of too kindly and liberal a nature to\r\nencourage or permit Byzantinism towards him on the part of others.\r\nIndeed Byzantinism was never a Hohenzollern failing. In his able work\r\non German civilization Professor Richard tells of some Silesian\r\npeasants who knelt down when presenting a petition to Frederick\r\nWilliam I, and were promptly told to get up, as \"such an attitude was\r\nunworthy of a human being.\" Only on one occasion in the reign has an\r\naction of the Emperor's afforded ground for the suspicion that he was\r\nfor a moment filled with the spirit of the Byzantine emperors--namely,\r\nwhen he demanded the \"kotow\" from the Chinese Prince Tschun, who led\r\nthe \"mission of atonement\" to Germany. This, however, was not really\r\nthe result of a Byzantine character or spirit, but of the excusable\r\nanger of a man whose innocent representative had been treacherously\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nOf affinity with the idea of Byzantinism is that as frequently\r\noccurring idea in German court and ordinary life conveyed by the word\r\n\"reaction.\" Here again we have one of those qualities to be found\r\namong mankind everywhere and always: the instinct opposed to change,\r\neven to those changes for the good we call progress, the disposition\r\nthat made Horace deride the _laudator temporis acti se puero_ of his\r\nday, the feeling of the man who laments the passing of the \"good old\r\ntimes\" and the military veteran who assures us that \"the country, sir,\r\nis going to the dogs.\" In political life such men are usually to be\r\nfound professing conservatism, owners of land, dearer to them often\r\nthan life itself, which they fear political change will damage or\r\ndiminish. In Germany the Conservative forces are the old agrarian\r\naristocracy, the military nobility, and the official hierarchy, who\r\nmake a worship of tradition, hold for the most part the tenets of\r\northodox Protestantism, dread the growing influence of industrialism,\r\nand are members of the Landlords' Association: types of a dying\r\nfeudalism, disposed to believe nothing advantageous to the community\r\nif it conflicts with any privilege of their class. Under the name of\r\nJunker, the Conservative landowners of the region of Prussia east of\r\nthe Elbe, they have become everywhere a byword for pride, selfishness,\r\nin a word--reaction. They and men of their kidney are to be\r\ndistinguished from the German \"people\" in the English sense, and hold\r\nthemselves vastly superior to the burghertum, the vast middle class.\r\nThey dislike the \"academic freedom\" of the university professor, would\r\nlimit the liberty of the press and restrain the right of public\r\nmeeting, and increase rather than curtail the powers of the police. On\r\nthe other hand, if they are a powerful drag on the Emperor's Liberal\r\ntendencies--Liberal, that is, in the Prussian sense--towards a\r\ncomprehensive and well-organized social policy, they are at least\r\nreliable supporters of his Government for the military and naval\r\nbudgets, since they believe as whole-heartedly in the rule of force as\r\nthe Emperor himself. The German Conservative would infinitely prefer a\r\nreturn to absolute government to the introduction of parliamentary\r\ngovernment. At the same time it should not be supposed that the\r\nEmperor or his Chancellor, or even his Court, are reactionary in the\r\nsense or measure in which the Socialist papers are wont to assert. It\r\nis doubtful if nowadays the Emperor would venture to be reactionary in\r\nany despotic way. Given that his monarchy and the spirit that informs\r\nit are secure, that Caesar gets all that is due to Caesar, and that he\r\nand his Government are left the direction of foreign policy, he is\r\nquite willing that the people should legislate for themselves, enjoy\r\nall the rights that belong to them under the _Rechtsstaat_ established\r\nby Frederick the Great, and, in short, enjoy life as best they can.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"DROPPING THE PILOT\"\r\n\r\nHeinrich von Treitschke, the German historian, writing to a friend,\r\nspeaks of the dismissal of Prince Bismarck as \"an indelible stain on\r\nPrussian history and a tragic stroke of fate the like of which the\r\nworld has never seen since the days of Themistocles.\"\r\n\r\nOpinions may differ as to the indelibility of the stain--which must be\r\ntaken as a reflection on the conduct of the Emperor; and parallels\r\nmight perhaps be found, at least by students of English history, in\r\nthe dismissal of Cardinal Wolsey by Henry VIII, or that of the elder\r\nPitt by George III. But there may well be general agreement as to the\r\ntragic nature of the fall, for it was a struggle between a strong\r\npersonality and the unknown, but irresistible, laws of fate.\r\n\r\nThe historic quarrel between the Emperor and his Chancellor was not\r\nmerely the inevitable clash between two dispositions fundamentally\r\ndifferent, but between--to adapt the expression of a modern poet--\"an\r\nage that was dying and one that was coming to birth.\" Old Prussia was\r\ngiving place to New Germany. The atmosphere of war had changed to an\r\natmosphere of peace. The standards of education and comfort were\r\nrising fast. The old German idealism was being pushed aside by\r\nmaterialism and commercialism, and the thoughts of the nation were\r\nturning from problems of philosophy and art to problems of practical\r\nscience and experiment. Thought was to be followed by action. Mankind,\r\nafter conversing with the ancients for centuries, now began to\r\nconverse with one another. The desire for national expansion, if it\r\ncould not be gratified by conquest, was to be satisfied by the spread\r\nof German influence, power, activity, and enterprise in all parts of\r\nthe world. Such a collision of the ages is tragedy on the largest\r\nscale, for nothing can be more tragic--more inevitable or\r\ninexorable--than the march of Progress.\r\n\r\nThe natures of the two men were, in important respects, fundamentally\r\ndifferent. Bismarck's nature was prosaic, primitive, unscrupulous,\r\ndomineering: a type which in an English schoolboy would be described\r\nas a bully, with the modification that while the bully in an English\r\nschool is always depicted as a coward at heart (a supposition,\r\nhowever, by no means always borne out in after-life), Bismarck had the\r\ncourage of a bull-dog. Moreover, Bismarck was a Conservative, a\r\nstatesman of expediency. The Emperor is a man of principle; and as\r\nexpediency, in a world of change, is a note of Conservatism, so, in\r\nthe same world, is principle the _leit-motiv_ of Liberalism. To call\r\nthe Emperor a man of principle may appear to be at variance with\r\ngeneral opinion as founded on exceptional occurrences, but these do\r\nnot supply sufficient material for a fair judgment, and there are many\r\nacts of his reign which show him to be Liberal in disposition.\r\n\r\nNot, it need hardly be said, Liberal in the English political sense.\r\nLiberalism in England--the two-party country--usually means a strong\r\ndesire to vote against a Conservative on the assumption that the\r\nConservative is nearly always completely wrong and never completely\r\nright. As will be seen later, there is no political Liberalism in the\r\nEnglish sense in Germany. The Emperor's Liberalism shows itself in his\r\nsympathy with his people in their desire for improvement as a society\r\nof which he is the head, selected by God and only restricted by a\r\nconstitutional compact solemnly sworn to by the contracting parties.\r\nProofs of this sympathy might be adduced--his determination to carry\r\nthrough his grandfather's social policy against Bismarck's wish,\r\nhowever hostile he was and is to Social Democracy; his steadfast peace\r\npolicy, however nearly he has brought his country to war; his\r\nencouragement of the arts among the lower classes, however limited his\r\nviews on art may be; his friendly intercourse with people of all\r\nnationalities and occupations.\r\n\r\nThe characters also of the two men were different. Bismarck's was the\r\nresult of civilian training; the Emperor's of military training.\r\nBismarck had small regard for manners, and would have scoffed had\r\nanyone told him \"manners makyth man\"; the Emperor is courtesy itself,\r\nas every one who meets him testifies. Bismarck was fond of eating and\r\ndrinking, with the appetite of a horse and the thirst of a drayman,\r\nuntil he was nearly eighty, and smoked strong cigars from morning to\r\nnight--a very pleasant thing, of course, if you can stand it. The\r\nEmperor has never cared particularly for what are called the pleasures\r\nof the table, is fond of apples and one or two simple German dishes,\r\nand has never been what in Germany is called a \"chain-smoker.\"\r\nBismarck appears not to have had the faintest interest in art; the\r\nEmperor, while of late disclaiming in all art company his lack of\r\nexpert knowledge, has always found delight in art's most classical\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nYet the two men had some deeply marked traits of character in common.\r\nThe Emperor, as was Bismarck, is Prussian, that is to say mediaeval,\r\nto the core, notwithstanding that he had an English mother and\r\nlived in early childhood under English influences. He has always\r\nexhibited, as Bismarck always did, the genuine qualities of the\r\nPrussian--self-confidence, tenacity of purpose, absolute trust in his\r\nown ideals and intolerance of those of other people, impatience of\r\nrivalry, selfishness for the advantage of Prussia as against other\r\nGerman States, as strong as that for the newly born Empire against\r\nother countries. Finally, the Emperor is convinced, as Bismarck was\r\nconvinced, that in the first and last resort, a society, a people, a\r\nnation, is based on force and by force alone can prosper, or even be\r\nheld together. Neither Bismarck nor the Emperor could ever sympathize\r\nwith those who look to a time when one strong and sensible policeman\r\nwill be of more value to a community than a thousand unproductive\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nLong before he became Imperial Chancellor Bismarck had done masterly\r\nand important work for the country. In 1862 he began his career by\r\nfilling the post of interim Minister President of Prussia at a time\r\nwhen the present Emperor was still an infant. It was on taking up the\r\nposition that he made the celebrated statement that \"great questions\r\ncannot be decided by speeches and majority-votes, but must be resolved\r\nby blood and iron.\" Born in April, 1815, two months before the battle\r\nof Waterloo, at Schoenhausen, in the Prussian Province of Saxony, not\r\nfar from Magdeburg, he studied at the universities of Gottingen and\r\nBerlin and passed two steps of the official ladder--Auscultator and\r\nReferendar--which may be translated respectively protocolist and\r\njunior counsel. His parliamentary career began in 1846, two years\r\nbefore the second French Revolution. At that time Prussia was an\r\nabsolute monarchy, without a Constitution or a Parliament. There was\r\nno conscription, that foundation-stone of Prussian power and of the\r\nmodern German Empire. Then came the agitated days of 1848, the\r\nsanguinary \"March Days\" in Berlin. Frederick William IV was on the\r\nthrone, and in 1847 permitted the calling of a Parliament, the\r\nforerunner of the present Reichstag; but only to represent the\r\n\"rights,\" not the \"opinions,\" of the people. \"No piece of paper,\"\r\ncried the King, \"shall come, like a second Providence, between God in\r\nheaven and this land!\" That, too, was Bismarck's sentiment,\r\ncourageously expressed by him when the Diet was debating the idea of\r\nintroducing the English parliamentary system, and proved by him in\r\ncharacter and conduct until the day of his death. He would have made a\r\nsplendid Jacobite!\r\n\r\nThe three \"March Days,\" the 18th, 19th, and 20th of March, 1848, form\r\none of the few occasions in Prussian or German history on which Crown\r\nand people came into direct and serious conflict. According to German\r\naccounts of the episode the outbreak of the revolution in France was\r\nfollowed by a large influx into Berlin of Poles and Frenchmen, who\r\ninstigated the populace to violence. Collisions with the police\r\noccurred, and on March 15th barricades began to be erected. Traffic in\r\nthe streets was only possible with the aid of the military. The King\r\nwas in despair, not so much, the accounts say, at the danger he was in\r\nof losing his throne as at the shedding of the blood of his folk, and\r\nissued a proclamation promising to grant all desirable reforms,\r\nabolishing the censorship of the press, and summoning the Diet to\r\ndiscuss the terms of a Constitution. The citizens, however, continued\r\nto build barricades, made their way into the courtyards of the palace,\r\nand demanded the withdrawal of the troops. The King ordered the\r\ncourtyards to be cleared, the palace guard advanced, and, either by\r\naccident or design, the guns of two grenadiers went off. No one was\r\nhit, but cries of \"Treason!\" and \"Murder!\" were raised. Within an hour\r\na score of barricades were set up in various parts of the town and\r\nmanned by a medley of workmen, university students, artists, and even\r\nmen of the Landwehr, or military reserve.\r\n\r\nAt this time there were about 14,000 troops at the King's disposal,\r\nand with these the authorities proceeded against the mob. A series of\r\nscattered engagements between mob and military began. They lasted for\r\neight hours, until at midnight General von Prittwitz, who was in\r\ncommand of the troops, was able to report to the King that the\r\nrevolution was subdued.\r\n\r\nNext morning, however, the 19th, numerous deputations of citizens\r\npresented themselves at the palace, and assuring the King that it was\r\nthe only means of preventing the further effusion of blood, renewed\r\nthe request for the withdrawal of the troops. The King consented,\r\nnotwithstanding the opposition of Prince, afterwards Emperor, William,\r\nand the troops were drawn off to Potsdam. The citizens thereupon\r\nappointed a National Guard, which took charge of the palace, and in\r\nthe evening a vast crowd appeared beneath the King's windows bearing\r\nthe corpses of those who had fallen at the barricades during the two\r\npreceding days. The dead bodies were laid in rows in the palace\r\ncourtyard, and the King was invited out to see them. He could not but\r\nobey, and bowed to the crowd as he stood bareheaded before the bodies.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the occurrences in Berlin in 1848 that while the\r\nPrussian idea of monarchy is deeply rooted in the German mind, the\r\npossibility of a sudden change in public sentiment and a radical\r\nalteration of the relations between Crown and people are never at any\r\ntime to be wholly disregarded. Hence it is that the Emperor and his\r\nGovernment are so insistent on the doctrine of Heaven-granted\r\nsovereignty, so ready to support more or less autocratic monarchies in\r\nother parts of the world, and so sensitive to popular movements like\r\nAnarchism and Nihilism in Russia, or the always-smouldering Polish\r\nagitation and the propaganda of the Social Democracy in Germany. When\r\nKing Frederick William IV said to his assembled generals at Potsdam a\r\nweek after the \"March Days,\" \"Never have I felt more free or more\r\nsecure than when under the protection of my burghers,\" his words were\r\ndrowned in the buzz of murmurs and the angry clanking of swords. The\r\nEmperor to-day might, or might not, endorse the words of his ancestor.\r\nMost probably he would not; for, judging by his speeches, his care for\r\nthe army, the military state with which he surrounds himself, and his\r\nhabitual appearance in uniform, he, though in truth far more a civil\r\nmonarch than the War Lord foreign writers delight in painting him, is\r\nevidently determined to rely only on his soldiers for every\r\neventuality at home as well as abroad.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best German authorities on Bismarck's falling-out with the\r\nyoung Emperor are the statements regarding it to be found in the\r\nmemoranda supplied at the time by Prince Bismarck himself to Dr.\r\nMoritz Busch; the Memoirs of Prince Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst,\r\nsubsequently Imperial Chancellor; and the monograph on Bismarck by Dr.\r\nHans Blum, one of the Chancellor's confidants. The memoranda supplied\r\nto Busch make regrettably few references to the subject, beyond giving\r\nthe terms of the official resignation and some scanty addenda thereto;\r\nbut enough is said generally by Busch concerning Bismarck's\r\nconversations to show that the Chancellor was deeply mortified by his\r\ndismissal. Bismarck indeed expressly denies this in a conversational\r\nstatement quoted by an able Bismarckian writer of our own time, Dr.\r\nPaul Liman; but in view of subsequent events and statements the denial\r\ncan hardly be taken as sincere. The passage referred to is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I bear no grudge against my young master, who is fiery and\r\n     lively. He wishes to make all men happy, and that is very\r\n     natural at his age. I, for my part, believe perhaps less in\r\n     this possibility, and have told him so too. It is very\r\n     natural that a mentor like myself does not please him, and\r\n     that he therefore rejects my advice. An old carthorse and a\r\n     young courser go ill in harness together. Only politics are\r\n     not so easy as a chemical combination: they deal with human\r\n     beings. I wish certainly that his experiments may succeed,\r\n     and am not in the least angry with him. I stand towards him\r\n     like a father whom a son has grieved; the father may suffer\r\n     thereby, but all the same he says to himself, 'He is a fine\r\n     young fellow.' When I was young I followed my King\r\n     everywhere: now that I am old I can no longer accompany my\r\n     master when he travels so far. Accordingly it is unavoidable\r\n     that counsellors who remained closer to him should win his\r\n     confidence at my expense. He is very easily influenced when\r\n     one puts before him ideas which he supposes will happily\r\n     affect the condition of the people, and he can hardly wait\r\n     to put them into operation. The Kaiser will achieve\r\n     reputation at once: I have my own to watch over, to defend.\r\n     I have sacrificed myself for renown and will not place it in\r\n     jeopardy.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe's Memoirs are much more valuable in respect of\r\npositive information, and especially in supplying an account of the\r\nincident taken from the lips of the Emperor himself. The Prince was\r\nwithout his great predecessor's ability, but was much more amiable and\r\nsincere. He was, moreover, a friend of both the parties concerned, and\r\nhe impartially jotted down events at the time they occurred. Lastly,\r\nif he was a courtier at heart, he was that not wholly unknown thing,\r\nan honest one. Dr. Hans Blum is obviously a partisan of the great\r\nChancellor's, but he may also be referred to for a fairly connected\r\naccount of the fall and the events that succeeded it up to the time of\r\nBismarck's death on July 30, 1898.\r\n\r\nApart from the differences in the ages and temperaments of the Emperor\r\nand the Chancellor, there were differences in their views as to\r\ncertain measures of policy. There was a difference of opinion as to\r\nGerman policy regarding Russia. Friendship with that country had been\r\nthe policy of both Emperor William I and Bismarck, and the latter had\r\neffected a reinsurance treaty with Russia, stipulating for Russian\r\nneutrality in case of a war between Germany and France,\r\nnotwithstanding the subsistence of the Triple Alliance between\r\nGermany, Austria, and Italy. The reinsurance treaty, which had been\r\nmade for a period of three years, was now about to expire, and while\r\nBismarck desired its renewal, the Emperor, in a spirit of loyalty to\r\nAustria, was against the renewal, and the treaty was not renewed. This\r\nwas the \"new course\" as it regarded Russia. The difference with regard\r\nto the anti-Socialist Laws has been referred to in our chapter on the\r\naccession.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Order of September, 1852, which has been mentioned as\r\nleading immediately to the resignation, regulated intercourse between\r\nthe Prussian Ministers and the Crown, its chief provision being that\r\nonly the Minister President, and not individual Ministers, should have\r\naudience of the Emperor regarding matters of home and foreign policy.\r\nThe Emperor desired the abrogation of the Order, for he wished to\r\nconsult with the Ministers individually. The text of Bismarck's\r\nofficial resignation, after describing the origin of the Order,\r\ncontinues:\r\n\r\n     \"If each individual Minister can receive commands from his\r\n     Sovereign without previous arrangement with his colleagues,\r\n     a coherent policy, for which some one is to be responsible,\r\n     is an impossibility. It would be impossible for any of the\r\n     Ministers, and especially for the Minister President, to\r\n     bear the constitutional responsibility for the Cabinet as a\r\n     whole. Such a provision as that contained in the Order of\r\n     1852 could be dispensed with under the absolute monarchy and\r\n     could also be dispensed with to-day if we returned to\r\n     absolutism without ministerial responsibility. But according\r\n     to the constitutional arrangements now legally in force the\r\n     control of the Cabinet by a President under the Order of\r\n     1852 is indispensable.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor replied to Prince Bismarck's resignation in a\r\ncommunication which the reader, according to his disposition, will\r\nregard as an effusion of the heart, immensely creditable to its\r\ncomposer, a model of an official reply as demanded by circumstances, a\r\nstriking example of the art of throwing dust in the public eye, or an\r\nequally striking contribution to the literature of excusable\r\nhypocrisy. It was as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"MY DEAR PRINCE,--With deep emotion I learn from your\r\n     request of the 18th instant that you have decided to retire\r\n     from the offices which you have filled for long years with\r\n     incomparable success. I had hoped not to have been compelled\r\n     to entertain the thought of separation during our lives.\r\n     While, however, in full consciousness of the important\r\n     consequences of your retirement, I am forced to accustom\r\n     myself to the thought. I do so, it is true, with a heavy\r\n     heart, but in the strong confidence that the grant of your\r\n     request will contribute as much as possible to the\r\n     protection and preservation for as long as possible of a\r\n     life and strength of unreplaceable value to the Fatherland.\r\n\r\n     \"The grounds you offer for your resignation convince me that\r\n     any further attempt to induce you to reconsider your\r\n     determination would have no prospect of success. I\r\n     acquiesce, therefore, in your wish by hereby graciously\r\n     releasing you from your offices as Imperial Chancellor,\r\n     President of my State Ministry, and Minister of Foreign\r\n     Affairs, and trust that your counsels and energy, your\r\n     loyalty and devotion, will not be wanting to me and the\r\n     country in the future also.\r\n\r\n     \"I have considered it as one of the most valued privileges\r\n     in my life that at the commencement of my reign I had you at\r\n     my side as my first counsellor. What you have done and\r\n     achieved for Prussia and Germany, what you have done for my\r\n     House, my ancestors, and me, will remain to me and the\r\n     German people in grateful and imperishable memory. But also\r\n     in foreign countries your wise and energetic peace policy,\r\n     which I, too, in the future also, as a result of sincere\r\n     conviction, decide to take as the guiding line of my\r\n     conduct, will be always gloriously recognized. It is not in\r\n     my power to requite your services as they deserve. I must\r\n     rest satisfied with assuring you of my own and the country's\r\n     ineffaceable thanks. As a sign of this thanks I confer on\r\n     you the rank of a Duke of Lauenburg. I will also send you a\r\n     life-sized picture of myself.\r\n\r\n     \"God bless you, my dear Prince, and grant you still many\r\n     years of an old age undisturbed and blessed with the\r\n     consciousness of duty faithfully done.\r\n\r\n     \"In this disposition I remain to you and yours in the future\r\n     also your sincere, obliged, and grateful Emperor and King,\r\n\r\n     \"WILLIAM I.R.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has never, so far as is publicly known, issued, or caused\r\nto be issued, an official account of the episode and its _péripéties_,\r\nbut the story he poured, evidently out of a full heart, into the ears\r\nof Prince Hohenlohe, then Statthalter of Alsace-Lorraine, during a\r\nmidnight drive from the railway station at Hagenau to the hunting\r\nlodge at Sufflenheim, is an historical document of practically\r\nofficial authenticity. It appears as follows in the Prince's\r\nMemoirs:--\r\n\r\n\"STRASBURG, 26 _April_, 1890.\r\n\r\n     \"On the evening of the 23rd, nine o'clock, I drove with\r\n     Thaden and Moritz to Hagenau, there to await the arrival of\r\n     the Emperor. We spent the evening with circle-officer Klemm.\r\n     I went to bed at eleven o'clock in the guest-room, and slept\r\n     until half-past twelve. Moritz and Thaden drove to the\r\n     station with a view to changing their clothes in the train.\r\n     At one o'clock I was again at the station, when the Emperor\r\n     punctually arrived. I presented the gentlemen to him, and\r\n     turned over General Hahnke to Baron Charpentier and\r\n     Lieutenant Cramer, for them to conduct him to the hunting\r\n     ground. Our journey lasted about an hour, during which the\r\n     Emperor related without a pause the whole story of his\r\n     quarrel with Bismarck. According to this the coolness had\r\n     already begun in December. The Emperor then demanded that\r\n     something should be done about the Working Class Question.\r\n     The Chancellor was against doing anything. The Emperor held\r\n     the view that if the Government did not take the initiative,\r\n     the Reichstag, _i.e_. the Socialists, Centre and\r\n     Progressives, would take the matter in hand, and then the\r\n     Government would lag behind. The Chancellor wanted to lay\r\n     the anti-Socialist Bill with the expulsion paragraph again\r\n     before the Reichstag, dissolving the chamber if it did not\r\n     accept the Bill, and then, if it came to disturbances, to\r\n     take energetic measures. The Emperor objected, saying that\r\n     if his grandfather, after a long and glorious reign, were\r\n     forced to repress disturbances no one would think ill of\r\n     him. It was different in his case, who had as yet\r\n     accomplished nothing. People would reproach him with\r\n     beginning his reign by shooting down his subjects. He was\r\n     ready to act, but he wished to do it with a good conscience\r\n     after endeavouring to redress the well-founded grievances of\r\n     the workmen, or at least after doing everything to meet\r\n     their justifiable claims.\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor therefore demanded at a ministerial conference\r\n     the submission of ministerial edicts which should contain\r\n     what subsequently they in fact did contain. Bismarck would\r\n     not hear of it. The Emperor then laid the question before\r\n     the Council of State, and eventually obtained the edicts in\r\n     spite of Bismarck's opposition. Bismarck, however, secretly\r\n     continued his opposition, and tried to persuade Switzerland\r\n     to persevere with its idea of an International Labour\r\n     Conference. The attempt was rendered nugatory by the loyal\r\n     attitude of the Swiss Minister in Berlin, Roth. At the very\r\n     same time Bismarck was trying to influence the diplomatists\r\n     against the conference.\r\n\r\n     \"The relations between the Emperor and Bismarck, already\r\n     shaken by these dissensions, were still further embittered\r\n     by the question of the Cabinet Order of 1852. Bismarck had\r\n     often advised the Emperor to summon the Ministers to him.\r\n     This the Emperor did, and as the intercourse became more\r\n     frequent Bismarck took it ill, was jealous, and dragged out\r\n     the Order of 1852 so as to keep Ministers from the Emperor.\r\n     The Emperor resisted and acquired the abrogation of the\r\n     Cabinet Order. Bismarck at first agreed, but gave no further\r\n     sign in the matter. The Emperor now demanded either that the\r\n     recission of the Order should be laid before him, or that\r\n     Bismarck should resign--a demand which the Emperor\r\n     communicated to Bismarck through General von Hahnke. The\r\n     Chancellor delayed, but at length gave in the resignation on\r\n     March 18th. It should be added that already, at the\r\n     beginning of February, Bismarck had told the Emperor that he\r\n     would retire. Afterwards, however, he declared that he had\r\n     thought the position over and would remain--a thing not\r\n     agreeable to the Emperor, though he made no remonstrance\r\n     until the affair of the Cabinet Order came in addition. The\r\n     visit of Windthorst to the Chancellor also gave rise to\r\n     unpleasantness, though it was not the deciding factor. In\r\n     any case the last three weeks were filled with disagreeable\r\n     conversations between the Emperor and the Chancellor. It\r\n     was, as the Emperor expressed it, a 'devil of a time,' and\r\n     the question was, as the Emperor himself said, whether the\r\n     dynasty Bismarck or the dynasty Hohenzollern should reign.\r\n     The Emperor spoke very angrily, too, about the article in\r\n     the _Hamburg News_. In foreign policy Bismarck, according to\r\n     the Emperor, went his own way, and kept back from the\r\n     Emperor much of what he did. 'Yes,' he said, 'Bismarck had\r\n     it conveyed to St. Petersburg that I wanted to adopt an\r\n     anti-Russian policy. But for that,' the Emperor added, 'he\r\n     had no proofs.'\r\n\r\n     \"This conversation,\" concludes Prince Hohenlohe, \"between\r\n     the Emperor and myself was told partly on the way to the\r\n     lodge and partly on the way back. Between came the shooting;\r\n     but there was no sport, as the Emperor took his stand in the\r\n     dark under a tree on which was a cock that did not 'call.'\"\r\n\r\nThe following further extracts from the Hohenlohe Memoirs are given\r\nrather with the object of showing the state of the political and\r\nsocial atmosphere in which the quarrel took place than as throwing any\r\nfresh light on its course. In June of the preceding year (1889) occurs\r\nan entry which registers the first signs of the coming storm. Prince\r\nHohenlohe is telling of a visit he made in June to the Grand Duke of\r\nBaden, whom he found irritated by Bismarck's proposal, made in\r\nconnection with the arrest of a Prussian police officer by the Swiss,\r\nto close the frontier against the canton Aargau. The Grand Duke, the\r\nPrince relates, quoted Herbert Bismarck as saying he \"could not\r\nunderstand his father any longer and that people were beginning to\r\nbelieve he was not right in his head.\"\r\n\r\nThe next entry in the Journal is dated Strasburg, August 24th. It\r\nconcerns another meeting with the Grand Duke, who now told him that\r\nBismarck had changed his views and that these oscillations had puzzled\r\nthe Emperor and at the same time heightened his self-consciousness;\r\nmoreover, that the Emperor noticed that things were being kept back\r\nfrom him and was becoming suspicious. There had already been a\r\ncollision between the Emperor and the Chancellor and the latter might\r\nhave to go. What then? Probably the Emperor thought of conducting\r\nforeign policy himself--but that, added the Grand Duke, would be very\r\ndangerous.\r\n\r\nThe feeling at Court regarding Bismarck's fall is shown by a passage\r\nin the Memoirs about this time. It runs:\r\n\r\n     \"At 1.30 p.m. dinner (at the palace) at which I sat between\r\n     Stosch and Kameke. The former told me much about his own\r\n     quarrel with Bismarck, and was as gay as a snow-king that he\r\n     can now speak freely and that the great man is no longer to\r\n     be feared. This comfortable sentiment is obvious here on all\r\n     sides.\"\r\n\r\nThe anecdote still current in Berlin, that Bismarck actually threw an\r\ninkstand at the Emperor's head is reduced to its proper proportions by\r\nthe following entry:\r\n\r\n     \"The Grand Duke of Baden, with whom I was yesterday, knows a\r\n     good deal about the recent crisis. He says the cause of the\r\n     breach between the Emperor and Chancellor was a question of\r\n     power, and that all other differences of opinion about\r\n     social legislation and other things were only secondary. The\r\n     chief ground was the Cabinet Order of 1852, which Bismarck\r\n     pressed on the attention of the Ministers without the\r\n     Emperor's knowledge, and so hindered them from going to make\r\n     their reports to the Emperor. The Emperor wanted the Order\r\n     rescinded, while Bismarck was against it. Nor had the\r\n     conversation with Windthorst led to the breach. A talk\r\n     between the Emperor and Bismarck about this conversation is\r\n     said to have been so tempestuous that the Emperor\r\n     subsequently said when describing it, 'He (Bismarck) all but\r\n     threw the inkstand at me.'\" To Hohenlohe Bismarck said, as\r\n     Hohenlohe remarked that the resignation had surprised him,\r\n     \"Me also,\" and that three weeks before he did not think\r\n     things would end as they had. Bismarck added: \"However, it\r\n     was to be expected, for the Emperor is now quite determined\r\n     to rule alone.\"\r\n\r\nFinally the Prince's Journal has the following:\r\n\r\n     \"Two things struck me in these last three days: one that no\r\n     one has any time and every one is in a greater hurry than\r\n     before; and secondly, that individualities have expanded.\r\n     Every individual is conscious of himself, while before,\r\n     under the predominating influence of Prince Bismarck,\r\n     individualities shrank and were kept down. Now they are all\r\n     swollen like sponges placed in water. That has its\r\n     advantages, but also its dangers. The single-minded will is\r\n     lacking.\"\r\n\r\nThe period between the great Chancellor's fall and his death nine\r\nyears later was marked by so many incidents as to make it almost as\r\n_mouvementé_ as the period of the fall itself. He retired to\r\nFriedrichsruh, all the more immediately as the new Chancellor, General\r\nvon Caprivi, showed such indecent haste in taking possession of the\r\nofficial residence that a portion of Bismarck's furniture was broken\r\nand rendered useless. That Bismarck retired with the angry feelings of\r\na Coriolanus in his heart, or, as Anglo-Saxon slang would have it, of\r\na \"bear with a sore head,\" became evident only a few weeks later. He\r\nwas visited by the inevitable interviewer, and chose the _Hamburg\r\nNews_ as the medium of communicating to the world his opinion of the\r\nnew _régime_ and the men who were conducting it; and made use of that\r\npaper with such instant vigour and acerbity that little more than two\r\nmonths from his retirement elapsed before the new Chancellor thought\r\nit advisable to issue instructions to Germany's diplomatic\r\nrepresentatives warning them carefully to distinguish between the\r\n\"present sentiments and views of the Duke of Lauenburg and those of\r\nthe erstwhile Prince Bismarck,\" and to pay no serious attention to the\r\nformer. Bismarck replied in the _Hamburg News_ that he would not allow\r\nhis mouth to be closed, and set about proving that he meant what he\r\nsaid. Nothing the men of the \"new course\" could do met with his\r\napproval. The first thing he fell foul of was the Anglo-German\r\nagreement of July 1, 1890, which gave Germany Heligoland in exchange\r\nfor Zanzibar, deploring the badness of the bargain for Germany, and\r\nevidently not foreseeing the importance that island's position,\r\ncommanding the approaches to the mouths of the Elbe and the Weser, was\r\nafterwards to possess. Besides the friendliness with England, the\r\ndetachment of Germany from Russia in favour of Austria, also a feature\r\nof the \"new course,\" did not please him as tending to drive Russia\r\ninto the arms of France.\r\n\r\nHis prescience, however, in this respect was demonstrated when a year\r\nlater the Czar saluted a French squadron in the harbour of Cronstadt\r\nto the strains of the \"Marseillaise\" and signed a secret agreement\r\nthat was alluded to four years later by the French Premier, M. Ribot,\r\nin the French Chamber of Deputies, who spoke of Russia as \"our ally,\"\r\nand was publicly announced in 1897, on the occasion of President Felix\r\nFaure's visit to St. Petersburg, by the Czar's now famous employment\r\nof the words \"_deux nations amies et alliées_.\"\r\n\r\nThe ex-Chancellor was as little satisfied with the new tariff treaties\r\nentered into by General Caprivi with Austria, Italy, Belgium, and\r\nother countries, which the Emperor, wiser, as events have shown, than\r\nhis former Minister, characterized on their passage by Parliament as\r\nthe country's \"salvation\" (_eine rettende Tat_). The ex-Chancellor's\r\ncaustic but mistaken criticism was punished by the calculated neglect\r\nof the Berlin authorities to invite him to the ceremonies attending\r\nthe celebration of the ninetieth birthday of his old comrade, General\r\nvon Moltke, in October, 1890, and that of his funeral in the following\r\nApril: still more publicly punished in connexion with the marriage of\r\nhis son Herbert.\r\n\r\nThe wedding of the latter to Countess Marguerite Hoyos was to take\r\nplace in Vienna on June 21, 1892, and on the 18th Prince Bismarck\r\nstarted with his family to attend it. The journey was a species of\r\ntriumphal progress to Vienna, but it was to end in disappointment and\r\nchagrin. As the result of representations from Germany, made doubtless\r\nwith the Emperor's assent, if not at his suggestion, Bismarck was met\r\non his arrival with the news that the German Ambassador, Prince Reuss,\r\nand the Embassy staff had orders to absent themselves from the\r\nwedding, that the widow of the Crown Prince Rudolph, who had accepted\r\na card of invitation to it, had suddenly left Vienna, and that the\r\nEmperor Franz Joseph would not receive him. The German action was\r\nexplained by the publication two months later of the edict,\r\nstigmatized by Bismarck as an \"Urias Letter,\" in which Caprivi warned\r\nforeign Governments against attaching any importance to the utterances\r\nof the Duke of Lauenburg. The Bismarckian and anti-Bismarckian storm\r\ncame up afresh in Germany. Bismarck was reproached by the Government\r\nas \"injuring monarchical feeling,\" and by his enemies as a traitor to\r\nhis country; while the angry statesman published a statement\r\nexpressing the opinion that\r\n\r\n     \"the control of private social intercourse abroad, and the\r\n     influencing of dinner invitations, were not tasks for which\r\n     high officers of State were selected nor public money for\r\n     the payment of diplomatic representatives voted\":\r\n\r\ndoubting, at the same time, \"if the foreign archives of any other\r\ncountry than Germany could show a parallel to the incident.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm, notwithstanding, had a good effect, for it brought out in\r\nbold relief the immense regard and respect the overwhelming majority\r\nof his countrymen entertained for the chief architect of their Empire;\r\nand when Bismarck fell ill at Kissingen in 1893 the Emperor,\r\nsubordinating his political animosities to the chivalrous instincts of\r\nhis nature, telegraphed his sorrow to the patient and offered to lend\r\nhim one of the royal castles for the purpose of his convalescence.\r\nBismarck declined, but not ungratefully, and the way to a\r\nreconciliation was opened. Next year, 1894, Bismarck suffered from\r\ninfluenza, and when this time the Emperor sent an adjutant to\r\nFriedrichsruh to express his regret, invited him to attend the\r\nfestivities on the forthcoming royal birthday, and sent along with the\r\ninvitation a flask of Steinberger Cabinet from the imperial cellar in\r\ncharacteristic German proof of the sincerity of his feelings, the\r\ncountry was delighted. Bismarck accepted the invitation and doubtless\r\ndrank the Steinberger; and the visit to Berlin followed in due time.\r\n\r\nThe reconciliation was completed amid sympathetic popular rejoicing.\r\nThe Emperor sent his brother, Prince Henry, to bring the ex-Chancellor\r\nfrom the railway station to the palace, where the Emperor himself,\r\nsurrounded by a brilliant staff, stood to welcome the guest. Bismarck\r\nspent the day at the palace with the Royal Family and was taken back\r\nto the railway station in the evening by the Emperor. A few days later\r\nthe Emperor returned the visit at Friedrichsruh.\r\n\r\nThe quiet of the ex-Chancellor's last years was once unpleasantly\r\naffected by the Reichstag in 1895, at the instance of his\r\nparliamentary enemies, rejecting, to its everlasting discredit, a\r\nproposal for an official vote of congratulation to the ex-Chancellor\r\non his eightieth birthday; but against this unpleasantness may be set\r\nhis gratification at the receipt of a telegram from the Emperor\r\nexpressing his \"deepest indignation\" at the rejection.\r\n\r\nPrince Bismarck died on July 30th, 1898, and was laid to rest at\r\nFriedrichsruh in the presence of the Emperor and Empress, while the\r\nworld paused for a moment in its occupations to discuss with\r\nsympathetic admiration the dead man's personality and career.\r\nBismarck's spirit is still abroad in Germany, and the popular memory\r\nof him is as fresh now as though he died but yesterday. It is more\r\nthan probable, much rather is it certain, that all trace of irritation\r\nwith the proud old Chancellor has long faded from the Emperor's mind:\r\nindeed at no time does there seem to have been sentiments of personal\r\nor permanent rancour on one side or the other. The episode, in short,\r\nwas an inevitable collision of ages, temperaments, and times,\r\nregrettable no doubt as a possibly harmful example of political\r\ndiscord among the leaders of the nation, but--with due respect for the\r\njudgment of so capable an historian as von Treitschke--leaving no\r\n\"indelible stain\" either on the pages of German history or on the\r\nreputations of Bismarck or the Emperor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSPACIOUS TIMES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1891-1899\r\n\r\nA great English poet sings of the \"spacious days\" of Queen Elizabeth.\r\nFrom the German standpoint the decade from the fall of Bismarck to the\r\nend of the century may not inaptly be described as the spacious days\r\nof William II and the modern German Empire. To the Englishman the\r\nactual territorial acquisitions of Germany during the period must seem\r\ncomparatively insignificant, but, taken in connection with the\r\nEmperor's speeches, the building of the German navy, the Caprivi\r\ncommercial treaties, the growth of friendly relations and of trade and\r\nintercourse with America, North and South, they mean the opening of a\r\nnew era in the history of the Empire--the era of Weltpolitik.\r\n\r\nHeligoland was obtained in exchange for Zanzibar in 1890, and is now\r\nregarded by Germans much as Gibraltar or Malta is regarded by\r\nEnglishmen. The first Kiel regatta, due solely to the initiative of\r\nthe Emperor, and starting the development of sport in all fields which\r\nis a feature of modern German progress, ethical and physical, was held\r\nin 1894. The Caprivi commercial treaties were concluded within the\r\nperiod. The Kiel Canal, connecting the Baltic and North Sea, and\r\ngiving the German fleet access to all the open waters of the earth,\r\nwas opened in 1895. In 1896 the Kruger telegram testified to imperial\r\ninterest in South African developments. The Hamburg-Amerika Line now\r\nsent a specially fast mail and passenger steamer across the Atlantic.\r\nThe district of Kiautschau was leased from China in 1898, securing\r\nGermany a foothold and naval base in the Far East. In the same year\r\nthe modern Oriental policy of the Empire was inaugurated by the\r\nEmperor's visit to Palestine and his declaration in the course of it\r\nthat he would be the friend of Turkey and of the three hundred\r\nmillions of Mohammedans who recognized the Sultan as their spiritual\r\nhead. To this year also belongs the measure, the most important in its\r\nconsequences and significance of the reign hitherto, the passing of\r\nthe First Navy Law. Finally, in 1899 Germany acquired the Caroline\r\nIslands by purchase from Spain, and certain Samoan Islands by\r\nagreement with England and America.\r\n\r\nNothing was more natural as a result of the new world-policy than a\r\nchange in the mental outlook of the people. It inaugurated in Germany\r\nan era somewhat analogous to the era inaugurated in England by the\r\nwidening and brightening of the Englishman's horizon under Elizabeth.\r\nThe analogy may not be closely maintainable throughout, but, generally\r\nspeaking, just as the eyes of Englishmen suddenly saw the\r\npossibilities of expansion disclosed to them by Drake, Raleigh, and\r\nFrobisher, so the Emperor's appeals, with the pursuance of German\r\ncolonial policy and the attempt to develop Germany's African\r\npossessions, led to an awakening in Germany of a similar, if weaker,\r\nkind. To this awakening the building of the German navy contributed;\r\nand though it did not appeal to the German imagination as did the\r\ndeeds of the old navigators to that of Elizabethan Englishmen, it\r\nwidened the national outlook and fired the people with new imperial\r\nambitions. Hitherto, moreover, Germany's attention had been confined\r\nalmost solely to trade within continental boundaries: henceforth she\r\nwas to do business actively and enterprisingly with all parts of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's thoughts on the subject were expressed in January, 1896,\r\nat a banquet in the Berlin palace given to a miscellaneous company of\r\nleading personalities of the time. The occasion was the celebration of\r\nthe twenty-fifth year of the modern Empire's foundation. He said:\r\n\r\n     \"The German Empire becomes a world-empire. Everywhere in the\r\n     farthest parts of the earth live thousands of our\r\n     fellow-countrymen. German subjects, German knowledge, German\r\n     industry cross the ocean. The value of German goods on the\r\n     seas amounts to thousands of millions of marks. On you,\r\n     gentlemen, devolves the serious duty of helping me to knit\r\n     firmly this greater German Empire to the Empire at home.\"\r\n\r\nThe expression \"greater German Empire\" immediately reminded the\r\nEnglishman of his own \"Greater Britain,\" and he concluded that the\r\nEmperor was secretly thinking of rivalling him in the extent and value\r\nof his colonial possessions. Possibly he was, and doubtless he\r\nardently desired to see Germany owning large and fertile colonies; but\r\nit is quite as probable he was thinking of his economic Weltpolitik,\r\nand knew as well then as he does now that it must be left to time and\r\nthe hour to show whether they fall to her or not.\r\n\r\nIn the same order of ideas may be placed, though it is anticipating\r\nsomewhat, the Emperor's utterances at Aix in 1902 and three years\r\nlater at Bremen. At Aix, after describing the failure of Charlemagne's\r\nsuccessors to reconcile the duties of a Holy Roman Emperor with those\r\nof a German King, he continued:\r\n\r\n     \"Now another Empire has arisen. The German people has once\r\n     more an Emperor of its own choice, with the sword on the\r\n     field of battle has the crown been won, and the imperial\r\n     flag flutters high in the breeze. But the tasks of the new\r\n     Empire are different: confined within its borders it has to\r\n     steel itself anew for the work it has to do, and which it\r\n     could not achieve in the Middle Ages. We have to live so\r\n     that the Empire, still young, becomes from year to year\r\n     stronger in itself, while confidence in it strengthens on\r\n     all sides. The powerful German army guarantees the peace of\r\n     Europe. In accord with the German character we confine\r\n     ourselves externally in order to be unconfined internally.\r\n     Far stretches our speech over the ocean, far the flight of\r\n     our science and exploration; no work in the domain of new\r\n     discovery, no scientific idea but is first tested by us and\r\n     then adopted by other nations. This is the world-rule the\r\n     German spirit strives for.\"\r\n\r\nAt Bremen he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The world-empire I dream of is a new German Empire which\r\n     shall enjoy on all hands the most absolute confidence as a\r\n     quiet, peaceable, honest neighbour--not founded by conquest\r\n     with the sword, but on the mutual confidence of nations\r\n     aiming at the same end.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's world-policy was referred to more than once about this\r\ntime by Chancellor Prince Bülow in the Reichstag. \"It is,\" he said on\r\none occasion, \"Germany's intention and duty to protect the great and\r\never-growing oversea interests which she has acquired through the\r\ndevelopment of conditions.\" \"We recognize,\" he continued,\r\n\r\n     \"that we have no longer interests only round our own\r\n     fireside or in the neighbourhood of the church clock, but\r\n     everywhere where German industry and Germany's commercial\r\n     spirit have penetrated; and we must foster these interests\r\n     within the bounds of possibility and good sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our world-policy,\" he said on another occasion in the same place,\r\n\r\n     \"is not a policy of interference, much less a policy of\r\n     intervention: had it interfered in South Africa (he was\r\n     alluding to the Boer War) it must have intervened, and\r\n     intervention implies the use of force.\"\r\n\r\nOn yet another occasion he explained that a prudent world-policy must\r\ngo hand in hand with a sound protective policy for home industry, and\r\nthat its basis must be a strong national home policy.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in all this, even supposing Germany's interests at\r\nthat time were purposely exaggerated, to which the foreigner could\r\nreasonably object. The foreigner felt perhaps slightly uncomfortable\r\nwhen the same statesman, departing for a moment from his usual\r\nobjective standpoint, spoke of the German \"traversing the world with a\r\nsword in one hand and a spade and trowel in the other\"; but otherwise\r\nno act of Germany's world-policy need have inspired alarm, or need\r\ninspire alarm at the present time, in sensible foreign minds. The\r\nrapidity of its action probably helped to excite a feeling that it\r\ncould not be altogether honest or above-board; but it should be\r\nremembered that the new Empire had much leeway to make up in the race\r\nwith other nations, and that quick development was rendered necessary\r\nby her commercial treaties, by her protective system, by the\r\nunexpected growth of industry and trade, by the continuous increase of\r\npopulation, the development of the mercantile marine, and the growing\r\nconsciousness of national strength.\r\n\r\nAnd if there is nothing in Germany's development of her world-policy\r\nto which the foreigner can reasonably object, there is much in it at\r\nwhich he can reasonably rejoice. Competition is good for him, for it\r\nputs him on his mettle. A large and prosperous German population\r\nextends his markets and means more business and more profit. The minds\r\nof both Germans and the foreigner become broader, more mutually\r\nsympathetic and appreciative. The elder Pitt warned his\r\nfellow-countrymen against letting France become a maritime, a\r\ncommercial, or a colonial power. She has become all three, and what\r\ninjury has occurred therefrom to England or any other nation?\r\n\r\nGermany's colonial development dates from about the year 1884, the\r\nperiod of the \"scramble for Africa.\" The first step to acquiring\r\nGerman colonies for the Empire was taken in 1883, when a merchant of\r\nBremen, Edouard Luderitz, made an agreement with the Hottentots by\r\nwhich the bay of Angra Pequena in South-West Africa, with an area of\r\nfifty thousand square kilometres, was ceded to him. Luderitz applied\r\nto Bismarck for imperial protection. Bismarck inquired of England\r\nwhether she claimed rights of sovereignty over the bay. Lord Granville\r\nreplied in the negative, but added that he did not consider the\r\nseizure of possession by another Power allowable. Indignant at what he\r\ncalled a \"monstrous claim\" on all the land in the world which was\r\nwithout a master, Bismarck telegraphed to the German Consul at the\r\nCape to \"declare officially to the British Government that Herr\r\nLuderitz and his acquisitions are under the protection of the Empire.\"\r\n\r\nThe Bremen pioneer was fated to gain no advantage from his enterprise,\r\nas he was drowned in the Orange River in 1886. His example as a\r\ncolonist, however, was followed by three Hanseatic merchants,\r\nWoermann, Jansen, and Thormealen, of Hamburg, who acquired land in\r\nTogo, a small kingdom to the east of the British Gold Coast, and in\r\nthe Cameroons, a large tract in the bend of the Gulf of Guinea,\r\nextending to Lake Chad, and applied for German imperial protection.\r\nBismarck sent Consul-General Nachtigall with the gunboat _Moewe_ in\r\n1884 to hoist the German flag at various ports. Five days after this\r\nhad been done the English gunboat _Flirt_ arrived, but was thus too\r\nlate to obtain Togoland and the Cameroons for England.\r\n\r\nDr. Carl Peters, the German Cecil Rhodes, now arrived at Zanzibar, and\r\non obtaining concessions from the Sultan founded the German East\r\nAfrica Company, with a charter from his Government. German hopes of\r\ngreat colonial expansion began to run high, but they were dashed by\r\nthe Anglo-German agreement of June, 1890, delimiting the spheres of\r\nEngland, Germany, and the Sultan of Zanzibar, and stipulating that\r\nGermany should receive Heligoland from England in return for German\r\nrecognition of English suzerainty in Zanzibar and the possession of\r\nUganda, which had recently been taken for Germany by Dr. Peters. At\r\nthat time Germans thought very little of Heligoland, but there was\r\nthen no Anglo-German tension, and no apprehension of an English\r\ndescent on the German coast.\r\n\r\nThe lease for ninety-nine years of Kiautschau, a small area of about\r\nfour hundred square miles on the coast of China, was obtained from the\r\nChinese in connexion with the murder of two German missionaries in\r\n1897 in the Shantung Province, of which Kiautschau forms a part. Herr\r\nvon Bülow, then only Foreign Secretary, referred to the transaction in\r\nthe Reichstag in words that may be quoted, as they describe German\r\nforeign policy in the Far East. \"Our cruiser fleet,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"was sent to Kiautschau Bay to exact reparation for the\r\n     murder of German Catholic missionaries on the one hand, and\r\n     to obtain greater security for the future against a\r\n     repetition of such occurrences. The Government,\"\r\n\r\nhe continued,\r\n\r\n\"has nothing but benevolent and friendly designs regarding China, and\r\nhas no wish either to offend or provoke her. We are ready in East Asia\r\nto recognize the interests of other Great Powers in the certain\r\nconfidence that our own interests will be duly respected by them. In\r\none word--we desire to put no one in the shade, but we too demand our\r\nplace in the sun. In East Asia, as in the West Indies, we shall\r\nendeavour, in accordance with the traditions of German policy, without\r\nunnecessary rigour, but also without weakness, to guard our rights and\r\nour interests.\"\r\n\r\nIn mentioning the West Indies the Foreign Secretary was alluding to a\r\nquarrel Germany had at this time with the negro republic of Haiti,\r\nowing to the arrest and imprisonment of a German subject in that\r\nisland. Kiautschau is administratively under the German Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThe Caroline, Marianne, and Palau Islands, including the Marschall\r\nIslands and the islands of the Bismarck archipelago, were bought from\r\nSpain this year for twenty-five million pesetas, or about one million\r\nsterling. The islands are valuable in German eyes, not only for their\r\nfertility and capacity for plantation development, but as affording\r\ngood harbourage and coaling stations on the sea-road to China, Japan,\r\nand Central America. By the agreement with England and America, which\r\nin this year also put an end to the thorny question of Samoan\r\nadministration, Germany acquired the Samoan islands of Upolu and\r\nSawaii in the South Sea.\r\n\r\nThe ten years we are now concerned with were perhaps the most\r\nstrenuous and picturesque of the Emperor's life hitherto. He was now\r\nhis own Chancellor, though that post was nominally occupied by General\r\nvon Caprivi and Prince Chlodwig Hohenlohe successively. He was\r\nChancellor, too, knowing that not a hundred miles off the old pilot of\r\nthe ship of State was watching, keenly and not too benevolently, his\r\nevery act and word. He was conscious that the eyes of the world were\r\nfixed on him, and that every other Government was waiting with\r\ninterest and curiosity to learn what sort of rival in statecraft and\r\ndiplomacy it would henceforward have to reckon with. Naturally many\r\nplans coursed through his restlessly active brain, but there were\r\nalways, one may imagine, two compelling and ever-present thoughts at\r\nthe back of them. One of these was a determination to promote the\r\nmoral and material prosperity of his people so as to make them a model\r\nand thoroughly modern commonwealth; the other, the resolve that as\r\nEmperor he would not allow Germany to be overlooked, to be treated as\r\na _quantité négligeable_, in the discussion or decision of\r\ninternational affairs.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellorship of General von Caprivi, who had been successively\r\nMinister of War and Marine, lasted from March, 1890, to October, 1894.\r\nHe may have been a good commanding general, but he has left no\r\nreputation either as a man of marked character or as a statesman of\r\nexceptional ability. Nor was either character or ability much needed.\r\nHe was, as every one knew, a man of immensely inferior ability to his\r\ngreat predecessor, but every one knew also that the Emperor intended\r\nto be his own Chancellor, pursue his own policy, and take\r\nresponsibility for it. Taking responsibility is, naturally, easier for\r\na Hohenzollern monarch than for most men, since he is responsible to\r\nno one but himself. With the appointment of Caprivi the Emperor's\r\n\"personal regiment\" may be said to have begun.\r\n\r\nDuring General von Caprivi's term of office some measures of\r\nimportance have to be noted, among them the Quinquennat, which\r\nreplaced Bismarck's Septennat and fixed the military budget for five\r\nyears instead of seven; the reduction of the period of conscription\r\nfor the infantry from three years to two; and the decision not to\r\nrenew Bismarck's reinsurance treaty with Russia.\r\n\r\nThe chief event, however, with which Chancellor Caprivi's name is\r\nusually associated, is the conclusion of commercial treaties between\r\nGermany and most other continental countries. Other countries had\r\nfollowed Germany's example and adopted a protective system, and with a\r\nview to the avoidance of tariff wars, Caprivi, strongly supported, it\r\nneed hardly be said, by an Emperor who had just declared that \"the\r\nworld at the end of the nineteenth century stands under the star of\r\ncommerce, which breaks down the barriers between nations,\" began a\r\nseries of commercial treaty negotiations.\r\n\r\nThe first agreements were made with Germany's allies in the Triplice,\r\nAustria and Italy. Treaties with Switzerland and Belgium, Servia and\r\nRumania, followed. Russia held aloof for a time, but as a great\r\ngrain-exporting country she too found it advisable to come to terms.\r\nWith France there was no need of an agreement, since she was bound by\r\nthe Treaty of Frankfurt, concluded after the war of 1870, to grant\r\nGermany her minimum duties. One of the regrettable results of the\r\nEmpire's new commercial policy was an antagonism between agriculture\r\nand industry which now declared itself and has remained active to the\r\npresent day. The political cause of Caprivi's fall from power, if\r\npower it can be called, was the twofold hostility of the Conservative\r\nand Liberal parties in Parliament, that of the Conservatives being due\r\nto the injury supposed to be done to landlord interests by the\r\ncommercial treaties, and that of the Liberals by an Education Bill,\r\nwhich, it was alleged, would hand the Prussian school system\r\ncompletely over to the Church. Perhaps the main cause, however, was\r\nthe general unpopularity he incurred by attacking, officially and\r\nthrough the press, his predecessor, Bismarck, the idol of the people.\r\n\r\nIt was in the Chancellorship of Prince Hohenlohe, which ended in 1900,\r\nthat the most memorable events of this remarkable decade occurred;\r\nbut, as was to be expected, and as the Emperor himself must have\r\nexpected, the Prince, now a man of seventy-five, played a very\r\nsecondary part with regard to them. The Prince was what the Germans\r\ncall a \"house-friend\" of the Hohenzollern family and related to it. He\r\nwas useful, his contemporaries say, as a brake on the impetuous temper\r\nof his imperial master, though he did not, we may be sure, turn him\r\nfrom any of the main designs he had at heart. Prince Hohenlohe, in\r\ncharacter, was good-nature and amiability personified. He was beloved\r\nby all classes and parties, and no foreigner can read his Memoirs\r\nwithout a feeling of friendliness for a Personality so moderate and\r\ncalm and simple. A note he makes in one of his diaries amusingly\r\nillustrates the simple side of his character. He is dining with the\r\nEmperor, when the Emperor, catching the Prince's eye, which we may be\r\nsure was on the alert to gather up any of the royal beams that might\r\ncome his way, raises his glass in sign of amity. \"I felt so overcome,\"\r\nnotes the Prince, \"that I almost spilt the champagne.\"\r\n\r\nThe famous \"Kruger telegram\" episode occurred during the\r\nChancellorship of Prince Hohenlohe.\r\n\r\nFor many years the sending of the telegram was cited as a convincing\r\nproof of the Emperor's \"impulsive\" character, and it was not until\r\n1909 that the truth of the matter was stated by Chancellor von Bülow\r\nin the Reichstag. In March of that year he said:\r\n\r\n     \"It has been asked, was this telegram an act of personal\r\n     initiative or an act of State? In this regard let me refer\r\n     you to your own proceedings. You will remember that the\r\n     responsibility for the telegram was never repudiated by the\r\n     directors of our political business at the time. The\r\n     telegram was an act of State, the result of official\r\n     consultations; it was in nowise an act of personal\r\n     initiative on the part of his Majesty the Kaiser. Whoever\r\n     asserts that it was is ignorant of what preceded it and does\r\n     his Majesty completely wrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's telegram to President Kruger, despatched on January 3,\r\n1896, ran as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I congratulate you most sincerely on having succeeded with\r\n     your people, and without calling on the help of foreign\r\n     Powers, by opposing your own force to an armed band which\r\n     broke into your country to disturb the peace, in restoring\r\n     quiet and in maintaining the independence of your country\r\n     against external attack.\"\r\n\r\nThe echoes of this historic message were heard immediately in every\r\ncountry, but naturally nowhere more loudly than in England; and the\r\nreverberation of them is audible to the present day. In Germany,\r\nhowever, for a day or two, the telegram seems to have surprised no\r\none, was indeed spoken of with approval by deputies in the Reichstag,\r\nand seems not to have occurred to any one in the light of a serious\r\ndiplomatic mistake. This state of feeling did not last long, and when\r\nthe English newspapers arrived an entirely new light was thrown on the\r\nmatter. The _Morning Post_ concluded an article with the words: \"It is\r\nnot easy to speak calmly of the Kaiser's telegram. The English people\r\nwill not forget it, and in future will always think of it when\r\nconsidering its foreign policy.\"  The British Government's comment on\r\nthe telegram was to put a flying squadron in commission and issue an\r\nofficial statement _urbi et orbi_, calling attention to the Convention\r\nmade with President Kruger in London in 1884, reserving the\r\nsupervision of the foreign relations of the Transvaal to the British\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor himself appears to have recognized that he and his\r\nadvisers had made a serious blunder, and that a gesture which, it is\r\nhighly probable, was partly prompted by the chivalrous side of his\r\ncharacter, was certain to be gravely misunderstood. At any rate his\r\npolicy, or that of his Government, changed, and instead of following\r\nup his encouraging words with mediation or intervention, he assumed an\r\nattitude of neutrality towards the war which soon after began.\r\nSubsequently, in the Reichstag, Chancellor von Bülow described the\r\ncourse the German Government pursued immediately before and during the\r\nwar; and there seems no reason to discredit his account. The speech\r\nwas made apropos of the projected visit of President Kruger to Berlin,\r\nwhen on his tour of despair to the capitals of Europe while the war\r\nwas still in progress. He was cheered by boulevard crowds in Paris,\r\nitself a thing of no great significance, and was received at the\r\nElysée and by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, M. Delcassé. The\r\nvisitor was very reserved on both occasions, and confined himself to\r\nsounding his hosts as to whether or not he could reckon on their good\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nFrom Paris he started for Berlin, where he had engaged a large and\r\nexpensive first-floor suite of rooms in a fashionable hotel. At\r\nCologne, however, shortly after entering Germany, a telegram from\r\nPotsdam awaited him, announcing the Emperor's refusal to grant him\r\naudience. The imperial telegram consisted of a few words to the effect\r\nthat the Emperor was \"not in a position\" to receive him. Nor in truth\r\nwas he. An audience at that moment would have meant war between\r\nGermany and England.\r\n\r\nAs to German policy with regard to the Boer War, Prince Bülow\r\nexplained that the German Government deplored the war not only because\r\nit was between two Christian and white races, that were, moreover, of\r\nthe same Germanic stock, but also because it drew within the evil\r\ncircle of its consequences important German economic and political\r\ninterests. He went on to describe their nature, enumerating under the\r\none head the thousands of German settlers in South Africa, the\r\nindustrial establishments and banks they had founded there, the busy\r\ntrade and the millions sterling of invested capital; while, as\r\nregarded the other head, the Government had to take care that the war\r\nexercised no injurious influence on German territory in that region.\r\n\r\nThe Government, the Chancellor claimed, had done everything consistent\r\nwith neutrality and the conservation of German interests to hinder the\r\noutbreak of the war. It had \"loyally\" warned the two Dutch republics\r\nof the disposition in Europe, and left them in no doubt as to the\r\nattitude Germany would adopt if war should come. These communications\r\nwere not made directly, but through the Hague authorities and the\r\nConsul-General of the Netherlands in Pretoria. At that time the United\r\nStates Government had come forward with a proposal for a submission of\r\nthe quarrel to its arbitration, but the proposal had been rejected by\r\nPresident Kruger.\r\n\r\nA little later the President changed his mind, but it was then too\r\nlate and war was declared. Once the die was cast, Germany could only\r\nwith propriety have interfered, provided she had reason to believe her\r\nmediation would be accepted by both parties: otherwise her conduct\r\nwould not be mediation, but be regarded, in accordance with diplomatic\r\nusage, as intervention with coercive measures in the background. For\r\nsuch a policy Germany had no disposition, for it meant running the\r\nrisk of a diplomatic defeat on the one hand and of an armed conflict\r\nwith England on the other.\r\n\r\nAs regards the visit of the President to Berlin and the Emperor's\r\nrefusal to receive him, the Chancellor asked would a reception have\r\ndone any good either to the President or to Germany, and he answered\r\nhis own question with an emphatic negative. To the President an\r\naudience would have been of no more use than the ovations and\r\ndemonstrations he was greeted with in Paris. To Germany a reception\r\nwould have meant a shifting of international relations to the\r\ndisadvantage of the country: in other words, would have meant the\r\nrisk, almost the certainty, of war. \"Wars,\" said the Chancellor in\r\nthis connexion,\r\n\r\n     \"are much more easily unchained through elementary popular\r\n     passions, through the passionate excitation of public\r\n     opinion, than in the old days through the ambitions of\r\n     monarchs or through the jealousies of Ministers.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he concluded:\r\n\r\n     \"With regard to England we stand entirely independent of\r\n     her: we are not a hair's-breadth more dependent on England\r\n     than England is on us. But we are ready on the basis of\r\n     mutual consideration and complete equality--about this\r\n     obvious preliminary condition for a proper relation between\r\n     two Great Powers we have never left any Power in doubt: I\r\n     say, we are ready on this basis to live with England in\r\n     peace, friendship, and harmony. To play the Don Quixote and\r\n     to lay the lance in rest and attack wherever in the world\r\n     English windmills are to be found, for that we are not\r\n     called upon.\"\r\n\r\nBut just then there was little prospect of \"peace friendship, and\r\nharmony\" with England. The world remembers, and unfortunately the\r\nEnglish people do not forget, that they had nowhere more bitter and\r\noffensive critics than in Germany. One refined method of opprobrium\r\nwas the unprohibited sale in the main streets of Berlin of spittoons\r\nbearing the countenance of the English Colonial Minister, Mr.\r\nChamberlain. A war with England would at that moment have been highly\r\npopular in Germany, but as the Chancellor wisely reminded the\r\nParliament, it was the duty of the statesman to protect international\r\nrelations from disturbance by intrigue or by popular demonstration.\r\n\r\nFinally the Chancellor dealt with a report widely current in England\r\nand Germany at the time, to the effect that the Emperor's refusal to\r\nreceive President Kruger was due to the influence of his uncle, King\r\nEdward. The Chancellor emphatically denied that any pressure of the\r\nkind from the English Court, or from any other source, had been\r\nemployed, and ended by saying:\r\n\r\n     \"To suppose that his Majesty the Kaiser could allow himself\r\n     to be influenced by family relations shows little\r\n     understanding of his character, or of his love of country.\r\n     For his Majesty solely the national standpoint is decisive,\r\n     and if it were otherwise, and family relations or dynastic\r\n     considerations determined our foreign policy, I would not\r\n     remain Minister a day longer.\"\r\n\r\nA precisely similar and unfounded charge, it will be remembered, was\r\nmade against King Edward VII in 1902, to the effect that it was Court\r\ninfluence, not the deliberate judgment of the Cabinet, that was the\r\nefficient cause of the co-operation of the British with the German\r\nfleet in the demonstration off the coast of Venezuela.\r\n\r\nA recent writer, Dr. Adolf Stein, gives an account of the sending of\r\nthe famous telegram which corroborates that of Prince von Bülow. The\r\ntelegram, according to this version, was a well-considered answer to a\r\nquestion from the Transvaal Government put to the German Government a\r\nmonth before the Raid occurred, and when the Transvaal Government got\r\nthe first inkling of the preparations being made for it. President\r\nKruger asked what attitude Germany would adopt in case of a war\r\nbetween England and the Boer republics. The answer given to the person\r\nwho made the inquiry on behalf of the Transvaal Government was that\r\nPresident Kruger might rest assured of Germany's\r\n\r\n     \"diplomatic support in so far as it was also Germany's\r\n     interest that the independence of the Boer States should be\r\n     maintained, but that for anything beyond this he should not\r\n     reckon on Germany's assistance or that of any Great Power.\"\r\n\r\nThis answer, Dr. Stein says, was in course of transmission by the post\r\nwhen the Raid occurred.\r\n\r\nThe Raid was made on January 1st. The event was at once telegraphed to\r\nBerlin, where Prince Hohenlohe was Chancellor, with Freiherr Marschall\r\nvon Bieberstein, afterwards German Ambassador in Constantinople and\r\nLondon, as his Foreign Secretary. According to Dr. Stein, they drew up\r\na telegram to President Kruger, and on the morning of the 3rd laid it\r\nbefore the Emperor, who had come early from Potsdam for consultation\r\non the matter. The Chancellor, it should be mentioned, had been at\r\nPotsdam the day previous, but at that time the news of the Raid had\r\nnot reached the Emperor. The Emperor, Chancellor, and Foreign\r\nSecretary now decided that a telegram congratulating President Kruger\r\nfor having repulsed the Raid \"without foreign aid\" was the best\r\nnon-committal form to adopt. The Emperor, Dr. Stein continues, raised\r\nsome objections, but was over-persuaded by Prince Hohenlohe and von\r\nBieberstein.\r\n\r\nAs confirming this version, a little note in Lord Goschen's Biography\r\nmay be recalled, in which Lord Goschen confides to a friend a few\r\nweeks before the Raid that the \"Germans were taking the Boers under\r\ntheir wing, as the Americans had done with the Venezuelans.\"\r\n\r\nEnough perhaps has been said to show that the sending of the telegram\r\nhad nothing to do with the Emperor's \"impulsive\" character, and it\r\nwill only be fair to him to let the notion that it had drop finally\r\nout of contemporary history. As an act of State it was in consonance\r\nwith German policy at the time. That policy, if it did not look to\r\nacquiring possession of the Transvaal, may very well have looked to\r\nenlisting the sympathies and friendship of the Dutch in South Africa,\r\nand finding in them and their country a field for German enterprise\r\nand a market for German goods; and there was therefore nothing\r\nimpulsive, however mistaken the act may have been as a matter of\r\nforeign policy, in the German Government's congratulating President\r\nKruger on successful resistance to a private raid.\r\n\r\nWe have suggested that the telegram was partly due to a certain\r\nelement of chivalry in the Emperor's character. The Emperor was well\r\nacquainted with other forms of government and other social systems\r\nbesides his own, and though a Hohenzollern could put himself in the\r\nposition of the chief of the little Boer republic, threatened as he\r\nwas with annihilation by a mighty and powerful opponent. Moreover,\r\nthere is always to be remembered the sympathy of view, particularly of\r\nreligious view, that existed in the two men as regarded their attitude\r\nand duties to their respective \"folk.\" The President had appealed to\r\nthe Emperor for help. The Emperor had had to refuse it, but had wired\r\nthat he would do all he could \"diplomatically.\" He knew that this was\r\nbut a poor sort of assistance, but it was something, and when the Raid\r\noccurred he gave the diplomatic assistance he had promised by sending\r\na telegram of congratulation. In any case--_tempi passati_. Foreign\r\npolicy is not concerned with sympathies or antipathies, and the whole\r\nepisode should be ignored, or, better still, forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe Kruger telegram, it turned out, was to usher in a long period of\r\ntension between two countries of the same race, singularly alike in\r\ntheir ideals of whatever is sound and praiseworthy in Christian\r\ncivilization, and almost equally mutual admirers of the fundamental\r\nfeatures of each other's national character. Unfortunately, along with\r\nthese fundamental features of the English and German national\r\ncharacters, the love of money, the _auri sacra fames_, has to be\r\nreckoned with, and in the race of nations for wealth and power the\r\nfundamental qualities are apt, for a time, to be overborne and cease\r\nto act. The rise of the modern German Empire to power and prosperity,\r\nand the new world-situation thus created, largely by the Emperor, is\r\nat the bottom of Anglo-German tension. As a main contributory cause of\r\nboth the power and the prosperity, was the creation of the German navy\r\nat the period of which we write.\r\n\r\nThe following is a parable which he who runs may read:--\r\n\r\n     In a certain town, with a large and heterogeneous\r\n     population, there was once a \"monster\" shop. The firm (there\r\n     were three partners) had been established for hundreds of\r\n     years, had thrown out several branches, and by hard work,\r\n     enterprise, and honesty had acquired a leading position in\r\n     the trade of the town: so much so, indeed, that as time went\r\n     on it had also come to do the carriage and delivery of goods\r\n     for most of the smaller shops, though some of these were\r\n     large houses themselves and the majority of them in a fair\r\n     way of business. The smaller shops were naturally a little\r\n     jealous of the \"monster,\" and it was the dream of every\r\n     owner of them to enlarge his premises and become the\r\n     proprietor of an equally great emporium as the \"monster.\"\r\n     One day, therefore, a little cluster of shops, at some\r\n     distance from the \"monster,\" suddenly resolved to form a\r\n     combination, and after settling a dispute with a neighbour\r\n     in consideration of a sum of money and a fruitful tract of\r\n     land, issued the prospectus of the new company and began to\r\n     do business on modern lines.\r\n\r\n     Almost from the very beginning the new company was a great\r\n     success: its situation was central; the company inspired its\r\n     members with enterprise and spirit; it was industrious,\r\n     energetic, and splendidly organized; and at last it began to\r\n     cut into the trade of the old-established \"monster.\"\r\n     Competition might have gone on in the ordinary way had not\r\n     the new company made a departure in business methods that\r\n     gradually roused special uneasiness among the members of the\r\n     \"monster\" firm. Hitherto the latter had its delivery vans\r\n     travel all over the town, and so well was this part of its\r\n     system carried on that the firm acquired all but a monopoly\r\n     of carrying and delivery. The new company, however, now\r\n     began to do a little in the same line, whereupon the\r\n     \"monster\" took to building a superior type of van much more\r\n     powerful and imposing, if also much more expensive, than the\r\n     one previously in use. The new company naturally followed\r\n     suit, and in a surprisingly short time had built, or had\r\n     under construction, several vans of an exactly similar kind.\r\n     The \"monster\" saw the new departure of their rivals at first\r\n     with curiosity, then with contempt, then with anxiety, and\r\n     finally with suspicion and alarm. At the time of writing the\r\n     alarm appears to have abated, but a good deal of the\r\n     suspicion remains. The town is the world, the \"monster\"\r\n     Great Britain, and the rival company the modern German\r\n     Empire.\r\n\r\nIt would require the Emperor himself properly to tell the story of his\r\ncreation of the modern German navy, and if he has a right to call any\r\npart of his people's property his own, he is justified in speaking, as\r\nhe invariably does, of \"my navy.\" As Prince William, his interest in\r\nthe subject may have been originally due, as has been seen, to his\r\npartly English parentage, his frequent visits to England, and the fact\r\nthat his physical disability threatened to prevent him taking an\r\nactive part in the more strenuous duties of the soldier. It is very\r\nprobable that it was in the region that cradled the British navy the\r\nidea of a great German navy was conceived by him. We have seen that\r\nthe Emperor, as Prince William, showed his enthusiasm in the matter by\r\ndelivering lectures on it in military circles, though it was not his\r\nlot, but that of his brother Henry, to be assigned the navy as a\r\nprofession. In his Order to the Navy on ascending the throne, he spoke\r\nof the \"lively and warm interest\" that bound him to the navy, shortly\r\nafterwards issued directions for a new marine uniform on the English\r\nmodel, and caused the introduction into the Lutheran Church service of\r\na special prayer for the arm. He gave a parliamentary soirée at the\r\nNew Palace in Potsdam, and before allowing his Conservative and\r\nNational Liberal guests to sit down to supper, made them listen to a\r\nlecture which occupied two hours, giving particular attention, with\r\nthe aid of maps and plans, to the battle of the Yalu between the\r\nfleets of China and Japan. He founded the Technical Shipbuilding\r\nSociety, and took, and takes, an animated part in its proceedings,\r\nsuggesting positions for the guns, the disposition of armour, the\r\ndimensions of submarines, and a hundred other details. In 1908 he\r\ndelivered an after-dinner lecture at the \"Villa Achilleion\" in Corfu\r\non Nelson and the battle of Trafalgar, based on the writings of\r\nCaptain Mark Kerr of the _Implacable_, at which the situations of the\r\nFrench, English, and Spanish fleets were sketched by the imperial\r\nhand. To his admiration for the writings of Captain Mahan his\r\npersistence in enlarging the fleet is said largely to be due. He is,\r\nof course, assisted by a host of able experts, among whom Admiral von\r\nTirpitz--the ablest German since Bismarck, many Germans say--is the\r\nmost distinguished; but as he is his own Foreign Minister and own\r\nCommander-in-Chief, he is, in the fullest sense, his own First Lord of\r\nthe Admiralty.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor closed one of his naval lectures with an anecdote which\r\nthe papers reported next day as being received with \"stormy\r\namusement.\" It was about the metacentrum, the centre of gravity in\r\nship construction. The Emperor told of his having asked an old sea\r\nlieutenant to explain to him the metacentrum. \"I received the answer,\"\r\nsaid the Emperor, \"that he did not know very exactly himself--it was a\r\nsecret. 'All I can say is,' the old seaman went on, 'that if the\r\nmetacentrum was in the topmast, the ship would over-turn.'\" The\r\nsuccess of a jest, one is told, lies in the ear of the hearer.\r\nPossibly something of the \"stormy amusement\" may have been called\r\nforth by the reflection that the imperial metacentrum had on occasion\r\ngot misplaced.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the natural and accidental predispositions of the\r\nEmperor, certain general considerations, which imposed themselves\r\nirresistibly on all men's attention as the century drew to its close,\r\nimpelled him to more energetic action. A student of the history of\r\nother countries as well as his own, and a watchful observer of the\r\ntendencies of the time, he felt that the young Empire was incomplete\r\nas long as it was without a navy corresponding in size and power to\r\nits army, the organization of which had been completed. With its army\r\nalone he regarded the Empire as a colossus, no doubt, but a colossus\r\nstanding on one leg, and was convinced that if the Empire was to be a\r\nsuccess it must have a navy at least able to withstand attack by any\r\nof his continental neighbours and potential enemies.\r\n\r\nOn ascending the throne the Emperor was naturally most occupied with\r\nthe internal situation of his new inheritance, and spent a good deal\r\nof his time railing at Social Democracy and the press, explaining the\r\nnature of his Heaven-appointed kingship, and rousing his somewhat\r\nlethargic people to a sense of their power and possibilities; but he\r\nfound a moment in 1891 to write under a photograph he gave the\r\nretiring Postmaster-General Stephan:\r\n\r\n     \"The world, at the end of the nineteenth century, stands\r\n     under the star of commerce; commerce breaks down the\r\n     barriers which separate the peoples and creates new\r\n     relations between the nations.\"\r\n\r\nThen the idea slumbered in his mind for a few years, while he\r\ncontinued to make his own people restless with criticism, perhaps\r\ndeserved, of their sluggishness, their pessimism, their party strife,\r\nand foreign peoples equally restless with phrases like \"_nemo me\r\nimpune lacessit_\"; until the idea came suddenly to utterance in 1897,\r\nwhen, on seeing the figure of Neptune on a monument to the Emperor\r\nWilliam, he broke out: \"The trident should be in our grip!\" From this\r\ntime, and for the next few years, the growth of the navy may be said\r\nto have never long been far from his thoughts. In sending Prince Henry\r\nto Kiautschau at the close of 1898 he made the remark that \"imperial\r\npower means sea power, and sea power and imperial power are dependent\r\non each other.\" Nine months afterwards at Stettin he used a phrase\r\nalone sufficient to keep his name alive in history: \"Our future lies\r\non the water!\"\r\n\r\nAt Hamburg, in 1899, he laid emphasis on the changes in the world\r\nwhich justify a naval policy one can see now was almost inevitable.\r\n\r\n\"A strong German fleet,\" he said, \"is a thing of which we stand in\r\nbitter need.\" And he continued:\r\n\r\n     \"In Hamburg especially one can understand how necessary is a\r\n     powerful protection for German interests abroad. If we look\r\n     around us we see how greatly the aspect of the world has\r\n     altered in recent years. Old-world empires pass away and new\r\n     ones begin to arise. Nations suddenly appear before the\r\n     peoples and compete with them, nations of whom a little\r\n     before the ordinary man had been hardly aware. Products\r\n     which bring about radical changes in the domain of\r\n     international relations, as well as in the political economy\r\n     of the people, and which in old times took hundreds of years\r\n     to ripen, come to maturity in a few months. The result is\r\n     that the tasks of our German Empire and people have grown to\r\n     enormous proportions and demand of me and my Government\r\n     unusual and great efforts, which can then only be crowned\r\n     with success when, united and decided, without respect to\r\n     party, Germans stand behind us. Our people, moreover, must\r\n     resolve to make some sacrifice. Above all they must put\r\n     aside their endeavour to seek the excellent through the ever\r\n     more-sharply contrasted party factions. They must cease to\r\n     put party above the welfare of the whole. They must put a\r\n     curb on their ancient and inherited weakness--to subject\r\n     everything to the most unlicensed criticism; and they must\r\n     stop at the point where their most vital interests become\r\n     concerned. For it is precisely these political sins which\r\n     revenge themselves so deeply on our sea interests and our\r\n     fleet. Had the strengthening of the fleet not been refused\r\n     me during the past eight years of my Government,\r\n     notwithstanding all appeals and warnings--and not without\r\n     contumely and abuse for my person--how differently could we\r\n     not have promoted our growing trade and our interests beyond\r\n     the sea!\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps; but perhaps, too, it was as well for the peace of the world\r\nthat Germany had no great war fleet during those eight years of\r\ntroubled international relations, and that the gentle and adjusting\r\nhand of Providence, not the mailed fist of the Emperor, was guiding\r\nthe destinies of nations.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the opening of the reign a German navy can hardly be said\r\nto have existed. Yet it should not be forgotten that Germany also has\r\nmaritime traditions of no small interest, if of no great importance,\r\nto the world. The Great Elector, the ancestor of the Emperor who ruled\r\nBrandenburg from 1640 to 1688, was fully conscious of the profit his\r\npeople might acquire by sea commerce, and the little navy of high-sea\r\nfrigates which he built stood manfully, and often successfully, up to\r\nthe more powerful navies of Sweden and Spain. This fleet was known,\r\ntoo, far away from Brandenburg, for the records tell how the Pope and\r\nthe Maltese Knights and Louis XIV willingly admitted it to their\r\nharbours.\r\n\r\nBut there was lacking what until lately has always hemmed German\r\nprogress--money; and the commercially-minded Dutch, a people\r\nthemselves with many German characteristics, kept the Germans from the\r\nsea. Then came Frederick the Great, who ruled from 1740 to 1786, and\r\nthose Germans who are fond of claiming Shakespeare for their own will\r\nalso tell you that the plan drawn up by Frederick for Pitt's seven\r\nyears' struggle with France--that plan so unfortunately imitated\r\nafterwards by the Emperor in his correspondence with Queen Victoria\r\nduring the Boer War--was the foundation-stone of British naval\r\nsupremacy! Frederick, too, saw the advantage of possessing a fleet,\r\nbut he had his hands full with France and Russia, and reluctantly had\r\nto decline the offer of the French naval hero, Labourdonnais, to build\r\nhim a battle-fleet. At this period, and in the Great Elector's time,\r\nEmden was the Plymouth of Prussia. When Frederick died, there followed\r\nthat time of which Germans themselves are ashamed--the hole-and-corner\r\ntime, the time when the parochial spirit was abroad and no German\r\nburgher saw beyond the village church and the village pump; the\r\nBiedermeier time (that comic figure of the German _Punch_), the time\r\nof genuine German philistinism, when the people were lapped in an\r\nidyllic repose and were content, as many are to-day, with the smallest\r\nand simplest pleasures.\r\n\r\nThis spirit continued until the early quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, when Professor Frederick List roused the attention of his\r\ncountrymen, and notably that of Bismarck, to the necessity of an\r\nindependent national existence and a national economic policy. In 1836\r\na committee recommended naval coast protection, but it was not until\r\n1848, when Denmark blockaded the German coast, that anything was done\r\nto provide for it. In that year the National Assembly of delegates\r\nfrom various German Diets, which met at Frankfort, voted for the\r\nmarine a million sterling to be levied on the German States, but only\r\none-half of the money could be collected. Still, three steam frigates,\r\none large and six small steam corvettes, and two sailing corvettes\r\nwere got together, but in 1852, owing to the poverty of the States,\r\ntwo of the ships were sold to Prussia for £60,000 and the rest\r\ndisposed of by auction at less than a fourth of their value. The\r\nofficers and men were disbanded with a year's pay.\r\n\r\nTo this humiliating state of things Bismarck refers in his \"Gedanken\r\nund Erinnerungen.\" \"The German fleet,\" he writes,\r\n\r\n     \"and Kiel harbour as a foundation for its institution, were\r\n     from 1848 on one of the most burning thoughts at whose fire\r\n     German aspirations for unity were accustomed to warm\r\n     themselves and to concentrate. Meanwhile, however, the\r\n     hatred of my parliamentary opponents was stronger than the\r\n     interest for a German fleet, and it seemed to me that the\r\n     Progressive party at that time preferred to see the\r\n     newly-acquired rights of Prussia to Kiel, and the prospect\r\n     of a maritime future founded on its possession, rather in\r\n     the hands of the auctioneer, Hannibal Fischer, than in those\r\n     of a Bismarck Ministry.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this on naval development in Prussia was slow; there was no\r\ninterest for a marine either among the governing classes or the\r\npeople; but it was not wholly neglected, for Wilhelmshaven was\r\nacquired from the Duchy of Oldenburg, a small fleet was sent to the\r\nOrient with a view to obtaining commercial treaties and concessions,\r\nand a sum of £320,000 was devoted annually to naval requirements.\r\nDuring the Danish War of 1864 a fleet of three screw corvettes, two\r\npaddle steamers, and a few gunboats was considered sufficient to\r\nprotect the coasts and make a blockade impossible.\r\n\r\nFrom 1885 onwards there had been several Navy Proposals, but it was in\r\nthat of 1889, a year after the Emperor's accession, that the beginning\r\nof Germany's naval policy is to be found. In that Proposal it was\r\nannounced that the Government intended to depart from the previous\r\nprinciples of naval policy which had \"become antiquated owing to the\r\nprogress of science and the character of future naval warfare, as also\r\nowing to the extension of Germany's oversea relations.\" Up to this\r\ntime German maritime needs had invariably been postponed to military\r\nrequirements. The necessity for a fleet was indeed recognized, but\r\nonly for purposes of coast defence and the prevention of a blockade of\r\nthe ports on the North Sea and Baltic. To this end no large fleet was\r\nconsidered needful, particularly as the war with France had\r\ndemonstrated the futility of coast attack. During that war two small\r\nfleets were sent from Cherbourg to blockade the North Sea and Baltic\r\ncoasts, but the admirals in charge found the task \"impossible\" and\r\nreturned to France after a few single engagements with divided honours\r\nhad occurred. At that time the German people felt entirely secure on\r\nthe score of invasion. The numerous espionage incidents of more recent\r\ntimes prove that this feeling of security has entirely passed away,\r\nand all countries are now armed as though they were to be invaded\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nEmperor William I did something, though not much, for the German navy.\r\nMoltke was interested in it and proposed an armoured cruiser fleet,\r\nbut he was thinking chiefly of coast defence. Roon also took up the\r\nmatter and laid a Navy Bill before the Diet in 1865, but it was\r\nrejected because, in Virchow's words, the Diet thought \"the\r\nConstitution more important than the development of the army and\r\nnavy.\" The war of 1866 showed the necessity of a fleet, and this time\r\nthe Diet accepted Roon's proposals. Still, however, the object was\r\ncoast defence; and when Emperor William I died the navy was relatively\r\nof no consideration. In the ten years between 1881 and 1891 only one\r\narmoured cruiser, the _Oldenburg_, was launched. With the accession of\r\nthe Emperor, however, began a new, and for the Emperor and the\r\nEmpire--why not candidly admit it?--a glorious chapter in German naval\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nAn incident during the reign which really touched German national\r\npride, and was one of the reasons which caused the Emperor to\r\naccelerate the building of a powerful fleet, was the eviction, if the\r\nterm is not too strong, of the German admiral, Diedrich, by the\r\nAmericans from the harbour of Manila in the course of the\r\nSpanish-American War. Admiral Dewey was in command of a blockading\r\nfleet at Manila. The ships of various nationalities, and among them\r\nsome German warships, were in the harbour. Various causes of\r\nirritation arose between the Germans and Americans. There was talk of\r\nSpain's being desirous of selling the Philippines to Germany, and the\r\nimpression got abroad in America that the Germans were inclined to\r\nbehave as if they were already the new masters of the islands. The\r\nGerman warships kept going in and out of the harbour of Millesares, a\r\nvillage close to Manila, in connexion with the exchange of\r\ntime-expired men, using search-lights, the American admiral thought,\r\nin an unnecessary way, and doing other acts which he considered might\r\ngive information to blockade-running vessels.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with custom, the Germans, had at first supplied\r\nthemselves with permits from the American admiral for crossing the\r\nblockade lines, but as time went on the German ships began to cross\r\nthe line without them. Admiral Dewey thereupon issued an order that\r\npermits must be obtained. The German admiral sent his flag-lieutenant\r\nto Admiral Dewey to protest, on the ground that warships are exempt\r\nfrom blockade regulations. The American admiral's reply was to bring\r\nhis fist down on his cabin table and say,\r\n\r\n     \"Tell Admiral Diedrich, with my compliments, that he must\r\n     obtain permits, and that if a German ship breaks the\r\n     blockade lines without one it spells war, for I shall fire\r\n     on the first vessel that attempts it.\"\r\n\r\nThe flag officer went back with the message, and Admiral Diedrich took\r\nhis ships, which were greatly inferior in number to those of the\r\nAmericans, out of the harbour.\r\n\r\nThe German navy, in contrast to the army, is a purely imperial\r\ninstitution--an institution, according to the Constitution, \"entirely\r\nunder the chief command of the Kaiser,\" consequently in no respect\r\nadministered or controlled by the federated kingdoms and states. One\r\nspeaks of the \"royal\" army, but of the \"imperial\" navy. The Emperor is\r\nofficially described as the navy's \"Chef,\" superintends its\r\norganization and disposition, with his brother Prince Henry as\r\nInspector-General, and appoints its officials and officers. He\r\nexercises his functions through the Marine Cabinet, a creation of his\r\nown, which serves as a connecting link between the Emperor and the\r\nAdmiralty.\r\n\r\nThe legislative stages of the growth of the German navy have so far\r\nbeen five in number. The first Navy Law passed the Reichstag on third\r\nreading, on March 28, 1898, 212 members voting for it and 139 against,\r\nin a Parliament of 397 members. It provided for the building of a\r\nfleet of seventeen battleships within a certain time, and fixed the\r\nage of the ships at twenty-five years. The new ships were divided into\r\nships-of-the-line (a new designation), large armoured cruisers, and\r\nsmall armoured cruisers. This fleet, however, was not large enough to\r\nhave any influence on sea politics or seaborne trade, and the\r\noccurrences of the Spanish-American War, just now begun and finished,\r\ndetermined the Emperor to make further proposals. A great agitation\r\nfor the navy was started throughout the Empire, and on January 25,\r\n1900, Admiral Tirpitz laid the second Navy Bill (a \"Novelle,\" as it is\r\ncalled) before the Reichstag.\r\n\r\nThe new measure demanded a doubling of the fleet. The first fleet was\r\nintended chiefly with a view to coast defence, while the new fleet was\r\nto assure \"the economic development of Germany, especially of its\r\nworld-commerce.\" If the first Navy Bill had excited surprise and\r\nuneasiness in England, the sensations roused by the second may be\r\nimagined, not altogether because of the increase of German naval\r\npower, but of the power that would result when the new German navy was\r\ncombined with the navies of Germany's allies of the Triplice. The\r\nthird Navy Bill was a consequence of the Russo-Japanese War and of the\r\nlesson taught by the sea-fight of Tsuschima. It was laid before the\r\nReichstag on November 28, 1905, for \"a stronger representation of the\r\nEmpire abroad.\" Its main object was to increase by almost one-half the\r\nsize of the battleships, thus following the lead of England, which had\r\ndecided on the new and famous \"Dreadnought\" class of vessel,\r\nremarkable for its five revolving armoured turrets (instead of two\r\npreviously) and the number of its heavy guns. Hitherto English\r\nwarships had had an average tonnage of about 14,000 tons: the tonnage\r\nof the original \"Dreadnought\" was 18,300 tons. Notwithstanding the\r\nenormous nature of the financial demand (£47,600,000 within eleven\r\nyears) the Reichstag passed the Bill on May 19, 1905. A torpedo fleet\r\nof 144 boats, in 24 divisions, was additionally provided for in this\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nThe fourth Navy Bill was brought in in 1908, with the diminution of\r\nthe age of the German battleship from twenty-five to twenty years as\r\nits principal aim. As a result the number of new ships to be built by\r\n1912 was raised from six to twelve. The fifth and last Navy Bill was\r\npassed last year, 1912, creating a third active squadron as reserve,\r\nmade up of existing vessels and three new battleships. The German navy\r\nnow consists of 41 battleships of the line, 12 large armoured\r\ncruisers, and 30 small armoured cruisers, the cruisers being for\r\npurposes of reconnaissance; the foreign-service fleet of 8 large and\r\n10 small armoured cruisers; and an active reserve fleet of 16\r\nbattleships, 4 large and 12 small armoured cruisers.\r\n\r\nLike sailors everywhere, the German sailor is a frank and hearty type\r\nof his race, and welcome wherever he goes. The German naval officer is\r\nusually of middle-class extraction, while a slightly larger proportion\r\nof the officers of the army is taken from the _noblesse_. He is a\r\nfine, frank, and manly fellow as a rule, and, like the Emperor,\r\nperfectly willing to admit that his navy is closely modelled on that\r\nof Great Britain. Moreover, in addition to a thorough knowledge of his\r\nprofession, he is able, in two cases out of three, to converse with\r\nuseful fluency in English, French, and in some cases Italian as well.\r\n\r\nThe navy, like the army, is recruited by conscription, but active\r\nservice is for three years, as in the German cavalry and artillery,\r\nwhile only two years in the German infantry. Naturally young men of an\r\nadventurous turn of mind frequently elect for the navy, as they hope\r\nthereby to see something of the world. At the end of their third year\r\nof service they may go back to civil life as reservists or may\r\n\"capitulate,\" that is, continue in active service for another year,\r\nand renew their \"capitulation\" thenceforward from year to year. The\r\nordinary sailor receives (since 1912) the equivalent of 14s. 6d. in\r\ncash monthly and 9s. for clothing, but when at sea additional pay of\r\n6s. a month. The result of the system of conscription is that about 40\r\nper cent. of the fleet's crews consist of what may be called seasoned\r\nsailors, the remainder being three-year conscripts. The officer class\r\nis recruited from young men who have passed a certain school standard\r\nexamination and enter the navy as cadets. The one-year-volunteer\r\nsystem (_Einjähriger Dienst_) only partially obtains in the navy, for\r\npurposes, namely, of coast defence and other services on land. After\r\ntwo years the cadet becomes a midshipman, and with five or six other\r\nmiddies serves for a year or so on board ship, when he becomes a\r\nsub-lieutenant and is promoted by seniority to full lieutenant,\r\ncaptain-lieutenant (the English naval lieutenant with eight\r\nyears' service), corvette-captain (the English naval commander,\r\nwith three stripes), frigate-captain (corresponding in rank to a\r\nlieutenant-colonel in the English army), and finally captain-at-sea\r\n(with four stripes), when he may get command of a battleship. To reach\r\nthis great object of the German naval officer's ambition takes on an\r\naverage twenty-four years, or about the same period as in the British\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\nThe upper ranks, in ascending order, are contre-admiral (the English\r\nrear-admiral), vice-admiral, admiral, grand-admiral (English Admiral\r\nof the Fleet). There are only four grand-admirals in Germany, namely,\r\nthe Emperor (as \"Chef\" of the navy), his brother Prince Henry (as\r\ninspector-general), retired Admiral von Koester (president of the Navy\r\nLeague), and Admiral von Tirpitz (Secretary of Admiralty and the only\r\n\"active\" grand-admiral). King George V of England is an admiral of the\r\nGerman navy, as the Emperor is an admiral of the British navy.\r\n\r\nSalutes are a matter of international agreement. They are: 33 guns\r\n(simultaneously from all ships) for the Emperor and foreign monarchs,\r\n21 for the Crown Prince of Germany or of a foreign country, 19 for a\r\ngrand-admiral or an ambassador, 17 for an admiral, the Secretary of\r\nAdmiralty or inspector-general, 15 for a vice-admiral, 13 for\r\ncontre-admiral, and so descending. 101 guns are fired on the Emperor's\r\nbirthday or on the birth of an imperial prince. 66 guns is the salute\r\nwhen a German monarch ascends the imperial throne, and 101 when a\r\nGerman Emperor dies.\r\n\r\nThe yearly salaries of German naval officers are as follows: Admiral,\r\n£1,294 (of which £699 is \"pay\"), vice-admiral, £897 (£677 \"pay\"),\r\ncontre-admiral, £772 (£677 \"pay\"), captain-at-sea, £520 (£438 \"pay\"),\r\ncorvette-captain, £396 (£280 \"pay\"), full lieutenant, £174 (£120\r\n\"pay\"), and so on downwards. Jews are not allowed to become officers\r\nof the navy, thus following the practice in the army. There is no law\r\nto prevent Jews becoming officers in either army or navy, but, as a\r\nmatter of tradition or prejudice, no regimental or naval commander is\r\nwilling to accept an Israelite among his officers.\r\n\r\nIt is time, however, to return to the personal doings of the Emperor.\r\nHe is responsible for Germany's foreign policy, and his duties in\r\nconnexion with it and with the navy must often have suggested to him\r\nthe desirability of seeing with his own eyes something of the Orient,\r\nthe new battlefield of the world's diplomacy, and possibly a new\r\nEldorado for European merchants and engineers. His journey to the\r\nEast, now undertaken, was, however, chiefly a religious one, though it\r\nhad also something of a chivalric character, since much of every\r\nGerman's imagination is concerned with the Crusades, the Order of\r\nKnight Templars, and similar historical or legendary incidents and\r\npersonalities in the early stages of the struggle between the\r\nChristian and the Saracen. The birthplace of Christ has special\r\ninterest for a Hohenzollern who holds his kingship by divine grace,\r\nand in the Emperor's case because his father had made the journey to\r\nJerusalem thirty years before. The Emperor, lastly, cannot but have\r\nbeen glad to escape, if only for a time, such harassing concerns as\r\nparty politics, scribbling journalists, long-winded ministerial\r\nharangues, and Social Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe journey of the Emperor and Empress to Palestine occupied about a\r\nmonth from the middle of October, 1898, to the middle of the following\r\nNovember, and while it was one of the most delightful and picturesque\r\nexperiences of the Emperor, it entailed some unforeseen and not\r\naltogether agreeable consequences. It was very much criticized in\r\nGermany as an exhibition of a theatrical kind, of the \"decorative in\r\npolicy,\" as Bismarck used to say, who saw no utility in decoration,\r\nand evidently did not agree with Shakspeare that the \"world is still\r\ndeceived by ornament.\" It was objected that the Emperor should have\r\nstayed at home to look after imperial business, that such a journey\r\nmust excite suspicion in England and France--in the former because\r\nEngland is an Oriental power, and in the latter because France is\r\nsupposed to claim special protective rights over Christianity in the\r\nEast.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman who reads what German writers say about the journey\r\ngets the impression that the criticism was an expression of\r\njealousy--jealousy, as we know from Bismarck and Prince Bülow, being a\r\nnational German failing. Every German ardently desires to see Italy\r\nand the Orient, but until of late years few Germans had the means of\r\ngratifying the wish. In one point, however, the critics were right.\r\nThe Emperor, when in Damascus, after saying that he felt \"deeply moved\r\nat standing on the spot where one of the most knightly sovereigns of\r\nall times, the great Sultan Saladin, stood,\" went on to say that\r\nSultan Abdul \"and the three hundred million Mohammedans who, scattered\r\nover the earth, venerated him as their Caliph, might be assured that\r\nat all times the German Emperor would be their friend.\" It was a\r\nharmless and vague remark enough, one would think, but political\r\nwriters in all countries have made great capital out of it ever since\r\nwhenever Germany's Oriental policy is discussed. At the risk of\r\nrepetition it may be said that that policy is, in the East as\r\nelsewhere, a purely economic one. The Emperor's mistake perhaps\r\nchiefly lay in raising hopes in Turkish minds which were very unlikely\r\nto be realized.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's allusion to Saladin as the most knightly sovereign of\r\nall times was a bad blunder. He was doubtless carried away by a\r\ncombination, in his probably at this time somewhat excited\r\nimagination, of the chivalrous figures of the crusading times with\r\nthoughts of the German Knight Templars and other soldierly characters.\r\nSaladin was a brave man physically, and fond of imperial magnificence,\r\nas is only natural and necessary for an Oriental potentate to be; and\r\na good deal of Eastern legend grew up about him on that account.\r\nLegend was enough for the Emperor in his then romantic mood. He\r\nforgot, or did not know, that Saladin, from the point of view of a\r\nmodern and in reality far more knightly age, was a sanguinary\r\nand fanatic ruffian, who showed no mercy to his Christian\r\nprisoners--killed, in fact, one of them, Rainald de Chatillon, with\r\nhis own hand, sacked Jerusalem, turned the Temple of Solomon into a\r\nmosque, after having it \"disinfected\" with rose-water, and killed Pope\r\nUrban III, who died, the chronicles tell, of sorrow at the news.\r\n\r\nThe journey was, as has been said, a delightful and picturesque\r\nexperience for the Emperor and the Empress. They passed through Venice\r\nwith its marble palaces, sailed over the sapphire waters of the\r\nAdriatic, and were received with great demonstrations of welcome by\r\nthe Sultan in Constantinople. When they were leaving, the Sultan gave\r\nthe Emperor a gigantic carpet, and the Emperor gave the Sultan a gold\r\nwalking-stick, an exact imitation of the stick Frederick the Great\r\nused to lean on, and sometimes, very likely, apply to the backs of his\r\ntrusty but stupid lieges.\r\n\r\nBefore disposing of the events of this period of the Emperor's life\r\nmention may be made of two or three occurrences which must have been a\r\nsource of political interest or social entertainment to him. From\r\namong them we select the Dreyfus case and the historic scene arranged\r\nfor the painter, Adolf Menzel, in Sans Souci.\r\n\r\nThe Dreyfus case, though its investigation brought to light no fact\r\nimplicating the German authorities, naturally aroused interest\r\nthroughout Germany. The interest was felt equally in the army,\r\nnotwithstanding that it contains no Jewish officer, and among the\r\ncivil population. In France, it will be remembered, the case acquired\r\nits importance from the charge, made by the anti-Semite Drumont and\r\nhis journal _La Libre Parole_, that the Jews were exploiting the\r\nGovernment and the country. There is an anti-Semite party in Germany,\r\nfounded by the Court preacher Stoecker in 1878, but possibly owing to\r\nthe prudence and good citizenship of the Jews in Germany, it has\r\ngained little weight or momentum since.\r\n\r\nThe \"affaire,\" as it was universally known, was only once referred to\r\nin the German Parliament, in January, 1898, when Chancellor von Bülow\r\ndeclared \"in the most positive way possible\" that there had \"never\r\nbeen any traffic or relations of any kind whatsoever between Dreyfus\r\nand any German authority,\" adding that the alleged finding of an\r\nofficial German communication in the wastepaper basket of the German\r\nEmbassy in Paris was a fiction. The Chancellor concluded by saying\r\nthat the case had in no respect ever troubled relations between\r\nGermany and France.\r\n\r\nThe incident most often cited as evidence of the Emperor's love of\r\nrecalling the days of his great ancestor, Frederick the Great, is the\r\nconcert he arranged at Sans Souci on June 13, 1895, to gratify, we may\r\nbe sure, as well as surprise, the famous painter. The incident and its\r\norigin are described in a work already mentioned, the \"Private Lives\r\nof William II and His Consort,\" by a lady of the Court. The account\r\ngiven below is illustrative of the unfriendly sentiments which are\r\nevident throughout the work, but the lady is probably fairly accurate\r\nas regards the incident, and in any case her gossip will give the\r\nreader some notion, though by no means an entirely faithful one, of\r\nthe Court atmosphere at the time. Talk at the palace during afternoon\r\ntea having turned on the fact that Adolf Menzel, the painter, would\r\nshortly celebrate his eightieth birthday, some one remarked on the\r\nrefusal by the Court marshal in the previous reign to allow him to see\r\nthe scene of his celebrated \"Flute Concert at Sans Souci,\" which he\r\nwas then composing, lighted up. The conversation, according to the\r\nlady writer, continued thus:--\r\n\r\n     \"'Maybe he was frightened at the prospect of furnishing a\r\n     couple of dozen wax candles,' sneered the Duke of Schleswig.\r\n\r\n     \"'More likely he knew nothing of Menzel's growing\r\n     reputation,' suggested Begas, the sculptor.\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor overheard the last words. 'Are you prepared to\r\n     say that my grand-uncle's chief marshal failed to recognize\r\n     the genius of the foremost Hohenzollern painter?' he asked\r\n     sharply.\r\n\r\n     \"'I would not like to libel a dead man,' answered Begas,\r\n     'but appearances are certainly against the Count. I have it\r\n     from Menzel's own lips that the Court marshal refused him\r\n     all and every assistance when he was painting the scenes of\r\n     life in Sans Souci. The rooms of the chateau were accessible\r\n     to him only to the same extent as to any other paying\r\n     visitor or the hordes of foreign tourists, and he had to\r\n     make his sketches piece-meal, gathering corroborative and\r\n     additional material in museums and picture-galleries.'\r\n\r\n     \"Quick as a flash the Kaiser turned to Count Eulenburg. 'I\r\n     shall repay the debt Prussia owes to Menzel,' he spoke, not\r\n     without declamatory effect. 'We will have the representation\r\n     of the Sans Souci flute concert three days hence. Your\r\n     programme is to be ready tomorrow morning at ten. Menzel,\r\n     mind you, must know nothing of this: merely command him to\r\n     attend us at the Schloss at supper and for a musical\r\n     evening.' And, turning round, he said to her Majesty: 'You\r\n     will impersonate Princess Amalia, and you, Kessel' (Adjutant\r\n     von Kessel, then Commander of the First Life Guards),\r\n     'engage all your tallest and best-looking officers to enact\r\n     the great King's military household.'\r\n\r\n     \"Again the Kaiser addressed Count Eulenberg: 'Be sure to\r\n     have the best artists of the Royal Orchestra perform\r\n     Frederick the Great's compositions, and let Joachim be\r\n     engaged for the occasion.' Saying this, he took her\r\n     Majesty's arm, and bidding his guests and the Court a hasty\r\n     good-night, strode out of the apartment.\"\r\n\r\nA description of the Empress's costume for the concert follows.\r\n\r\n     \"Her Majesty's dress consisted of a petticoat of sea-green\r\n     satin, richly ornamented with silver lace of antique pattern\r\n     and an overdress of dark velvet, embroidered with gold and\r\n     set with precious stones. On her powdered hair, amplified by\r\n     one of Herr Adeljana, the Viennese coiffeur's, most\r\n     successful creations, sat a jaunty three-cornered hat having\r\n     a blazing aigrette of large diamonds in front, the identical\r\n     cluster of white stones which figured at the great\r\n     Napoleon's coronation, and which he lost, together with his\r\n     entire equipage, in the battle of Waterloo. In her ears her\r\n     Majesty wore pearl ornaments representing a small bunch of\r\n     cherries. Like the aigrette, they are Crown property, and\r\n     that Auguste Victoria thought well enough of the jewels to\r\n     rescue them from oblivion for this occasion was certainly\r\n     most appropriate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's costume is also described.\r\n\r\n\"He wore the cuirassier uniform of the great Frederick's period, a\r\nhighly ornamented dress that suited the War Lord, who was painted and\r\npowdered to perfection, extremely well, especially as Wellington\r\nboots, a very becoming wig and his strange head-gear really and\r\nseemingly added to his figure, while his usually stern face beamed\r\npleasantly under the powder and rouge laid on by expert hands.\"\r\n\r\nThe arrival of Menzel is then narrated and the reception by the\r\nEmperor, who took the part of an adjutant of Frederick the Great's,\r\nand in that character \"bombarded the helpless master,\" as the\r\nchronicler says,\r\n\r\n     \"with forty stanzas of alleged verse, in which the deeds of\r\n     Prussia's kings and the masterpieces that commemorate them\r\n     were extolled with a prosiness that sounded like an\r\n     afterclap of William's Reichstag and monument orations.\"\r\n\r\nA real concert followed, and supper was taken in the Marble Hall\r\nadjoining. The authoress concludes as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I was contemplating these reminiscences (the pictures of La\r\n     Barberini) in silent reverie when the door opened and the\r\n     Kaiser came in with little Menzel.\r\n\r\n     \"'I have a mind to engage Angeli to paint her Majesty's\r\n     picture in the costume of Princess Amalia,' said the Emperor\r\n     'What do you think of it?'\r\n\r\n     \"'Angeli is painter to many emperors and kings,' replied the\r\n     Professor, and I saw him smile diplomatically as he moved\r\n     his spectacles to get a better view of the allegorical\r\n     canvas on the left wall that exhibits the nude figure of the\r\n     famous mistress in its entirety.\r\n\r\n     \"'I am glad you agree with me on that point,' said the\r\n     Emperor, impatient to execute the idea that had crossed his\r\n     mind. 'I will telegraph to him to-night.'\r\n\r\n     \"And when, five minutes later, Menzel bent over my hand to\r\n     take formal leave, I heard him murmur in his dry,\r\n     absent-minded manner--'Pesne ... Angeli ... Frederick the\r\n     Great ... William II!\"\r\n\r\nWe have spoken of the Court atmosphere of this time. The following\r\nextracts from the Memoirs of ex-Chancellor Prince Hohenlohe will\r\nassist the reader, perhaps even better than a connected account, to\r\nenter, in imagination at all events, into it. The conversations cited\r\nbetween the Emperor and the Prince turn on all sorts of topics--the\r\npass question in Alsace (where Hohenlohe was then Statthalter), the\r\npossibility of war with Russia, pheasant shooting, projected\r\nmonuments, the breach with Bismarck, the Triple Alliance, and a\r\nhundred more of the most different kinds. Once talking domestic\r\npolitics, the Emperor said:\r\n\r\n     \"It will end by the Social Democrats getting the upper hand.\r\n     Then they will plunder the people. Not that I care. I will\r\n     have the palace loop-holed and look on at the plundering.\r\n     The burghers will soon call on me for help;\"\r\n\r\nand on another occasion, in 1889, Hohenlohe tells of a dinner at the\r\npalace, and how after dinner, when the Empress and her ladies had gone\r\ninto another _salon_, the Emperor, Hohenlohe, and Dr. Hinzpeter (the\r\nEmperor's old tutor) conversed together for an hour, all standing.\r\n\"The first subject touched on,\" relates the Prince, was the gymnasia\r\n(high schools), the Emperor holding that they made too exacting claims\r\non the scholars, while Hohenlohe and Hinzpeter pointed out that\r\notherwise the run on the schools would be too great and cause danger\r\nof a \"learned proletariat.\" Prince Hohenlohe concludes:\r\n\r\n     \"In the whole conversation, which never once came to a\r\n     standstill, I was pleased by the fresh, lively manner of the\r\n     Emperor, and was in all ways reminded of his grandfather,\r\n     Prince Albert.\"\r\n\r\nNext year the Prince was present at an official dinner in the Berlin\r\npalace. He writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"BERLIN, 22 _March_, 1890.\r\n\r\n     \"At seven, dinner in the White Salon (at the palace). I sat\r\n     opposite the Empress and between Moltke and Kameke. The\r\n     former was very communicative, but was greatly interfered\r\n     with by the continuous music, and was very angry at it. Two\r\n     bands were placed facing each other, and when one ceased the\r\n     other began to play its trumpets. It was hardly endurable.\r\n     The Emperor made a speech in honour of the Queen of England\r\n     and the Prince of Wales (afterwards King Edward, present on\r\n     the occasion of the investiture of his son Prince George,\r\n     now King George V, with the Order of the Black Eagle), and\r\n     mentioned his nomination as English admiral (whose uniform\r\n     he was wearing) and the comradeship-in-arms at the battle of\r\n     Waterloo; he also hoped that the English fleet and the\r\n     German army would together maintain peace. Moltke then said\r\n     to me: 'Goethe says, \"a political song, a discordant song.\"'\r\n\r\n     \"He also said he hoped the speech wouldn't get into the\r\n     papers.\"\r\n\r\n(It did, however.)\r\n\r\nThe next extract describes a conversation Prince Hohenlohe had with\r\nthe Emperor at Potsdam the following year. It gives an idea of the\r\nordinary nature of conversations between the Emperor and his high\r\nofficials on such occasions.\r\n\r\n     \"BERLIN, 13 _December_, 1891.\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday forenoon was invited to the New Palace at\r\n     Potsdam. Besides myself were the Prince and Princess von\r\n     Wied, with the Mistress of the Robes and the Court marshal.\r\n     Emperor and Empress very amiable. The Emperor spoke of his\r\n     hunting in Alsace, and supposed it would be some years\r\n     before the game there would be abundant. Then he expressed\r\n     his satisfaction at my acquisition of Gensburg, and when I\r\n     told him there was not much room in the castle he said, no\r\n     matter, he could nevertheless pass a few days there with a\r\n     couple of gentlemen very pleasantly. Passing to politics, he\r\n     gave vent to his displeasure at the attitude of the\r\n     Conservative party, who were hindering the formation of a\r\n     Conservative-monarchical combination against the\r\n     Progressives and Social Democrats. This was all the more\r\n     regrettable as the Progressives, if now and then they\r\n     opposed the Social Democrats, still at bottom were with\r\n     them. The Emperor approves of the commercial treaties and\r\n     seemed to have great confidence in Caprivi generally. As we\r\n     came to speak of intrigues and gossip, the Emperor hinted\r\n     that Bismarck was behind them. He added that people were\r\n     urging him from many quarters to be reconciled with\r\n     Bismarck, but it was not for him to take the first step. He\r\n     seemed well informed about the situation in Russia and\r\n     considered it very dangerous. When I asked the Emperor how\r\n     he stood now with the Czar, he replied 'Badly. He went\r\n     through here without paying me a visit, and I only write him\r\n     ceremonious letters. The Queen of Denmark prevented him\r\n     coming to Berlin, for fear he should go to Potsdam. She has\r\n     gone now with him to Livadia on the pretext of the silver\r\n     wedding, but in reality to keep him away from Berlin.'\"\r\n\r\nWriting of a lunch at Potsdam, under date Berlin, November 10, 1892,\r\nthe Prince notes:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor came late and looked tired, but was in good\r\n     spirits. We went immediately to table. Afterwards the\r\n     conversation turned on Bismarck. 'When one compares what\r\n     Bismarck does with that for which poor Arnim had to suffer!'\r\n     He would do nothing, he said, against Bismarck, but the\r\n     consequences of the whole thing were very serious. Waldersee\r\n     and Bismarck couldn't abide one another. They had, however,\r\n     become allies out of common hatred of Caprivi, whose fall\r\n     Bismarck desired. What might happen afterwards neither\r\n     cared.\"\r\n\r\nThe following was penned after the old Chancellor's visit of\r\nreconciliation:--\r\n\r\n     \"BERLIN, 27 _January_, 1894.\r\n\r\n     \"To-night gala performance at the opera. Between the acts I\r\n     talked first with different monarchs, the King of\r\n     Württemberg, the King of Saxony, the Grand Duke of\r\n     Oldenburg, and so on. Then I was sent for by the Empress, of\r\n     whom I took leave. The Emperor came shortly afterwards. We\r\n     spoke of Bismarck's visit the day before and the good\r\n     consequences for the Emperor it would have. 'Yes,' said the\r\n     Emperor, 'now they can put up triumphal arches for him in\r\n     Vienna and Munich, I am all the time a length ahead. If the\r\n     press continues its abuse it only puts itself and Bismarck\r\n     in the wrong.' I mentioned that red-hot partisans of\r\n     Bismarck were greatly dissatisfied with the visit, and said\r\n     the Emperor should have gone to Friedrichsruh (Bismarck's\r\n     estate near Hamburg). 'I am well aware of it,' said the\r\n     Emperor,'but for that they would have had a long time to\r\n     wait. He had to come here.' On the whole the Emperor spoke\r\n     very sensibly and decisively, and I did not at all get the\r\n     impression that he now wants to change everything.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe was summoned to Potsdam in October, 1894, by a\r\ntelegram from the Emperor. All the telegram said was that \"important\r\ninterests of the Empire\" were concerned. Hohenlohe was only aware of\r\nthe dismissal of Caprivi from a newspaper he read in Frankfort on his\r\nway to Potsdam. The Emperor met him at the station (Wildpark) and\r\nconveyed him to the New Palace, where the Prince agreed to accept the\r\nChancellorship \"at the Emperor's earnest request.\" Princess Hohenlohe\r\nwas decidedly against her husband, who was now seventy-five, accepting\r\nthe post, and even ventured to telegraph to the Empress to prevent it.\r\n\r\nThe Prince has a note on his intercourse with his imperial master. He\r\nis writing to his son, Prince Alexander:--\r\n\r\n     \"BERLIN, 17 _October_, 1896.\r\n\r\n     \"It is a curious thing--my relations to his Majesty. I come\r\n     now and then to the conclusion, owing to his small\r\n     inconsideratenesses, that he intentionally avoids me and\r\n     that things can't continue so. Then again I talk with him\r\n     and see that I am mistaken. Yesterday I had occasion to\r\n     report to him, and he poured out his heart to me and took\r\n     occasion in the friendliest way to ask my advice. And thus\r\n     my distrust is dissipated.\"\r\n\r\nHunting with the Emperor:--\r\n\r\n     \"15 _December_, 1896.\r\n\r\n     \"Yesterday I obeyed the royal invitation to hunt at Springe.\r\n     I had to leave Berlin as early as 7 a.m. to catch the royal\r\n     train at Potsdam. From Springe railway station we passed\r\n     immediately into the hunting district. Only sows were shot.\r\n     I brought down six. Then we drove to the Schloss, rested for\r\n     a few hours and then dined. The Emperor was in very good\r\n     humour and talked incessantly; in addition the Uhlan band\r\n     and the usually noisy conversation.\"\r\n\r\nWhen presenting his resignation to the Emperor at Hamburg in October,\r\n1900, the Prince, who had evidently been for some time aware that his\r\nterm of office was drawing to a close, describes his conversation with\r\nthe Emperor:--\r\n\r\n     \"At noon, as I came to the Emperor, he received me in a very\r\n     friendly way. We first settled about summoning the\r\n     Reichstag, and then his Majesty said, 'I have received a\r\n     very distressing letter'--an allusion to the Chancellor's\r\n     official letter of resignation, which he had placed in the\r\n     Emperor's hands through Tschirschky, Foreign Minister. 'As I\r\n     then,' continued Hohenlohe, 'explained the necessity of my\r\n     resignation on the ground of my health and age the Emperor,\r\n     apparently quite satisfied, agreed, so that I could see he\r\n     had already expected my request and consequently that it was\r\n     high time I should make it. We talked further over the\r\n     question of my successor, and I was agreeably surprised when\r\n     he forthwith mentioned Bülow, who certainly at the moment is\r\n     the best man available. His Majesty then said he would\r\n     telegraph to Lucanus (Chief of the Civil Cabinet) to bring\r\n     Bülow to Homburg so that we might consult about details. I\r\n     breakfasted with their Majesties and went calmly home.'\"\r\n\r\nWriting to his daughter next day Prince Hohenlohe, in words that do\r\nequal credit to himself and the imperial family, says:\r\n\r\n     \"It is always a pleasure to me when on such occasions I can\r\n     convince myself of the Christian disposition of the imperial\r\n     family. In our for the most part unbelieving age this family\r\n     seems to me like an oasis in the desert.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Hohenlohe was succeeded as Chancellor by Prince von Bülow, who\r\nhad held the office of Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs for the\r\npreceding two years, and practically conducted the Emperor's foreign\r\npolicy during that time. He had served as Secretary of Embassy in St.\r\nPetersburg, Vienna, and Athens, was a Secretary to the Congress of\r\nBerlin, fought in the war with France and after seven years as\r\nMinister in Bucharest spent four years as Ambassador in Rome. Here he\r\nmarried a divorced Italian lady, the Countess Minghetti. After acting\r\nas deputy Foreign Secretary for the late Baron Marschall von\r\nBieberstein, he was appointed permanent Foreign Secretary, and on\r\nOctober 17, 1900, was called by the Emperor to the most responsible\r\npost in the Empire next to his own, that of Imperial Chancellor. The\r\nEmperor's choice was fully justified, for the new Chancellor proved\r\nhimself to be the most brilliant diplomatist and parliamentarian since\r\nBismarck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1900-1901\r\n\r\nGerman writers, commenting on the turn of the century, claim to\r\ndiscover a change in the Emperor's character about this period. He has\r\nlost much of his imaginative, his Lohengrin, vein, and has become more\r\npractical, more prosaic and matter-of-fact. To use the German word, he\r\nis now a _Realpolitiker_, one who deals in things, not words or\r\ntheories, and drawing his gaze from the stars makes them dwell more\r\nattentively on the immediate practical considerations of the world\r\nabout him. His nature has not changed, of course, nor his manner, but\r\nhe has begun to see that he must employ means and ways different from\r\nthose he employed previously. He has not become a Bismarck, for he\r\nstill pursues his aims more in the spirit of the colonel of a regiment\r\nleading his men to the attack with banners flying, drums beating,\r\nswords rattling in their scabbards and mailed gauntlets held\r\nthreateningly aloft, than in that of the cool and calculating\r\npolitician ruminating in his closet on the tactics of his opponents,\r\nand deliberating how best to meet and confound them; but he gives more\r\nthought to what is going on about him, to party politics, to the\r\neconomic necessities of the hour, and to modern science and its\r\ninventions.\r\n\r\nWhat strikes the Englishman perhaps as much as anything in the\r\nEmperor's character at this time is the Cromwellian trait in it. This\r\nis a side of his Protean nature which never seems to have been\r\nadequately recognized in England, yet in a singularly baffling\r\ncharacter-composition it is one of the fundamental elements. The view\r\nof Prussian monarchy, inherited from one Hohenzollern to another for\r\ngeneration after generation, that the race of people to which he\r\nbelonged (with any other race he could include by conquest in it) has\r\nbeen handed over by Heaven for all eternity to his family, naturally\r\npredisposes him to take a religious, a patriarchal, one might say an\r\nHebraic, view of government; but in addition we find the warrior\r\nspirit at all times going hand in hand with the religious spirit,\r\nalmost as strongly as in the case of Mahomet with the Koran in one\r\nhand and the sword in the other.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in the Emperor's youth to show the existence of\r\ndeeply religious conviction, but as soon as he mounted the throne, and\r\nall through the reign up to the close of the century, indeed some\r\nyears beyond it, his speeches, especially when he was addressing his\r\nsoldiery, were filled with expressions of religious fervour. \"Von\r\nGotten Gnaden,\" he writes as a preface for a Leipzig publication\r\nappearing on January 1, 1900,\r\n\r\n     \"is the King; therefore to God alone is he responsible. He\r\n     must choose his way and conduct himself solely from this\r\n     standpoint. This fearfully heavy responsibility which the\r\n     King bears for his folk gives him a claim on the faithful\r\n     co-operation of his subjects. Accordingly, every man among\r\n     the people must be thoroughly persuaded that he is, along\r\n     with the King, responsible for the general welfare.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be noted in passing that Cromwell and the Emperor are alike in\r\nbeing the founders of the great war navies of their respective\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nOn the date mentioned (New Year's Day), in the Berlin arsenal when\r\nconsecrating some flags, he addressed the garrison on the turn of the\r\nyear:\r\n\r\n     \"The first day of the new century finds our army, that is\r\n     our folk in arms, gathered round its standards, kneeling\r\n     before the Lord of Hosts--and certainly if anyone has reason\r\n     to bend the knee before God, it is our army.\"\r\n\r\n\"A glance at our standards,\" the Emperor continued,\r\n\r\n     \"is sufficient explanation, for they incorporate our\r\n     history. What was the state of our army at the beginning of\r\n     the century? The glorious army of Frederick the Great had\r\n     gone to sleep on its laurels, ossified in pipeclay details,\r\n     led by old, incapable generals, its officers shy of work,\r\n     sunk in luxury, good living, and foolish self-satisfaction.\r\n     In a word, the army was no longer not only not equal to its\r\n     task, but had forgotten it. Heavy was the punishment of\r\n     Heaven, which overtook it and our folk. They were flung into\r\n     the dust, Frederick's glory faded, the standards were cast\r\n     down. In seven years of painful servitude God taught our\r\n     folk to bethink itself of itself, and under the pressure of\r\n     the feet of an arrogant usurper (Napoleon) was born the\r\n     thought that it is the highest honour to devote in arms\r\n     one's life and property to the Fatherland--the thought, in\r\n     short, of universal conscription.\"\r\n\r\nThe word for conscription, it may be here remarked, is in German\r\n_Wehrpflicht_, the duty of defence. To most people in England it means\r\nsimply \"compulsory military service.\" It is important to note the\r\ndifference, as it explains the German national idea, and the Emperor's\r\nidea, that all military and naval forces are primarily for defence,\r\nnot offence. This is, indeed, equally true of the British, or perhaps\r\nany other, army and navy; but how many Englishmen, when they think of\r\nGermany, can get the idea into the foreground of their thoughts or\r\naccustom themselves to it?\r\n\r\nHowever, we have not yet done with the Emperor's baffling character.\r\nThere was a third element that now developed in it--the modern, the\r\ntwentieth-century, the American, the Rockefeller element. It is\r\nintimately connected with his Weltpolitik, as his Weltpolitik is with\r\nhis foreign policy in general--indeed one might say his Weltpolitik is\r\nhis foreign policy--a policy of economic expansion, with a desperate\r\napprehension of losing any of the Empire's property, and a\r\ndetermination to have a voice in the matter when there is any loose\r\nproperty anywhere in the world to be disposed of. To the Hebraic\r\nelement and the warrior element (an entirely un-Christlike\r\ncombination, as the Emperor must be aware) there now began to be added\r\nthe mercantile, the modern, the American element--the interest in all\r\nthe concerns of national material prosperity, in the national\r\naccumulation of wealth, the interest in inventions, in commercial\r\nscience, in labour-saving machinery, the effort to win American\r\nfavour, to facilitate intercourse and establish close and profitable\r\nrelations with that wealthy land and people.\r\n\r\nWe know that the Emperor has English blood in him, greatly admires\r\nEngland, and is immensely proud of being a British admiral. We have\r\nseen him exhibiting traits of character that remind one of Lohengrin\r\nor Tancred. He has played many parts in the spirit of a Hebrew prophet\r\nand patriarch, of a Frederick the Great, a Cromwell, a Nelson, a\r\nTheodore Roosevelt. Preacher, teacher, soldier, sailor, he has been\r\nall four, now at one moment, now at another. We shall find him anon as\r\nart and dramatic critic, to end--so far as we are concerned with\r\nhim--as farmer. Is it any wonder if such a man, mediæval in his nature\r\nand modern in his character, defies clear and definite portrayal by\r\nhis contemporaries?\r\n\r\nTaking the year 1900 as the first year of the new century, not as some\r\ncalculators, and the Emperor among them, take it, as the last year of\r\nthe old, the twentieth century may be said to have opened with a\r\ndramatic historical episode in which the Emperor and his Empire took\r\nvery prominent parts--the Boxer movement.\r\n\r\nLittle notice has been taken in our account of Germany's spacious days\r\nof her relations to China and the Far East generally. They were,\r\nnevertheless, all through that period intimately connected with her\r\nexpansion or dreams of expansion. About 1890 the Flowery Land awoke to\r\nthe benefits of European civilization and in particular of European\r\ningenuity; and in 1891, for the first time in Chinese history, foreign\r\ndiplomatists were granted the privilege of an annual reception\r\nat the Chinese Court. So exclusive was the Manchu dynasty--the\r\nHohenzollerns of China in point of antiquity; yet not a score of\r\nyears later the Manchu monarchy had been quietly removed from its\r\nfive-thousand-year-old throne, and China, apparently the most\r\nconservative and monarchical people on earth, proclaimed itself a\r\nrepublic--a regular modern republic!--an operation that among peoples\r\nclaiming infinite superiority to the Chinese would have cost thousands\r\nof lives and a vast expenditure of money.\r\n\r\nNaturally, once China showed a willingness to abandon its axenic\r\nattitude towards foreign devils and all things foreign-devilish, the\r\nEuropean Powers turned their eyes and energies towards her, and a\r\nstrenuous commercial and diplomatic race after prospective concessions\r\nfor railways, mines, and undertakings of all kinds began. Each Power\r\nfeared that China would be gobbled up by a rival, or that at least a\r\npartition of the vast Chinese Empire was at hand. Consequently, when\r\nChina was beaten in her war with Japan, and made the unfavourable\r\ntreaty of Shimonoseki, the European Powers were ready to appear as\r\nhelpers in time of need. Russia, Germany, and France got the\r\nShimonoseki Treaty altered, and the Laotung Peninsula with Port Arthur\r\ngiven back, and in return Russia acquired the right to build a railway\r\nthrough Manchuria (the first step towards \"penetration\" and\r\noccupation), French engineers obtained several valuable mining and\r\nrailway concessions, and Germany got certain privileges in Hankow and\r\nTientsin.\r\n\r\nMeantime the old, deeply-rooted hatred of the foreign devil, the\r\nEuropean, was spreading among the population, which was still, in the\r\nmass, conservative. Missionaries were murdered, and among them, in\r\n1897, two German priests. Germany demanded compensation, and in\r\ndefault sent a cruiser squadron to Kiautschau Bay. Russia immediately\r\nhurried a fleet to Port Arthur and obtained from China a lease of that\r\nport for twenty-five years. England and France now put in a claim for\r\ntheir share of the good things going. England obtained Wei-hai-Wei,\r\nFrance a lease of Kwang-tschau and Hainan. China was evidently\r\nthrowing herself into the arms of Europe, when, in 1898, the Dowager\r\nEmpress took the government out of the hands of the young Emperor and\r\na period of reaction set in. The appearance of Italy with a demand for\r\na lease of the San-mun Bay in 1899 brought the Chinese anti-foreign\r\nmovement to a head, and the Boxer conspiracy grew to great dimensions.\r\n\r\nThe movement was caused not merely by religious and race fanaticism,\r\nbut by the popular fear that the new European era would change the\r\neconomic life of China and deprive millions of Chinese of their wonted\r\nmeans of livelihood. The Dowager Empress and a number of Chinese\r\nprinces now joined it. Massacres soon became the order of the day, and\r\nit is calculated that in the spring of 1900 alone more than 30,000\r\nChristians were barbarously done to death. Among the victims were\r\nreckoned 118 English, 79 Americans, 25 French, and 40 of other\r\nnationalities. The Ambassadors and Ministers of all nations, conscious\r\nof their danger, applied to the Tsungli Yamen (Foreign Office),\r\ndemanding that the Imperial Government should crush the Boxer\r\nmovement. The Government took no steps, the diplomatists were\r\nbeleaguered in their embassies, and were only saved by friendly police\r\nfrom being murdered.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was but a temporary respite, and it became necessary to\r\nbring marines from the foreign ships of war lying at the mouth of the\r\nPei-ho River just out of range of the formidable Taku Forts. These\r\ntroops, 2,000 in all, were led by Admiral Seymour. They tried to reach\r\nPekin, but failed owing to the destruction of the railway, and retired\r\nto Tientsin, from whence, however, on June 16th, a detachment set out\r\nto capture the Taku Forts. The capture was effected, the German\r\ngunboat _Iltis_, under Captain Lans, playing a conspicuously brave\r\npart. Tientsin was now in danger from the Boxer bands, but was\r\nrelieved by a mixed detachment of Russians and Germans under General\r\nStoessel, the subsequent defender of Port Arthur.\r\n\r\nThe alarm meantime at Pekin was intense. The Chinese Government,\r\nthrowing off all disguise, ordered the diplomatists to leave the city.\r\nThey refused, knowing that to leave the shelter of the embassies meant\r\ntorture and death. One of them, however, the German Minister, Freiherr\r\nvon Ketteler, ventured from his Legation and was killed in broad\r\ndaylight on his way to the Chinese Foreign Office. Only one of the\r\nMinister's party escaped, to stagger, hacked and bloody, into the\r\nBritish Legation with the news. This Legation, as the strongest\r\nbuilding in the quarter, became the refuge of the entire diplomatic\r\ncorps, with their wives, children, and servants. It was straightway\r\ninvested and bombarded by the Boxers, and as the days and weeks went\r\non the other Legation buildings were burned, and the refugees in the\r\nBritish Legation had to look death at all hours in the face.\r\n\r\nThe murder of von Ketteler excited anger and horror throughout the\r\nworld, and in no breast, naturally, to a stronger degree than in that\r\nof the German Emperor. All nations hastened to send troops to Pekin.\r\nJapan was first on the scene with 16,000 men under General\r\nYamagutschi. Russia followed next with 15,000 under General Lenewitch,\r\nthen England with 7,500 under General Gaselee, then France with 5,000\r\nunder General Frey, then America with 4,000 under General Chaffee,\r\nGermany with 2,500 under von Hopfner, Austria and Italy with smaller\r\ncontingents--in all more than 50,000 men, with 144 guns. A little\r\nlater the expeditionary corps from Germany, 19,000 strong, under\r\nGeneral von Lessel, and that from France, 10,000 strong, arrived. At\r\nthe suggestion, it is said, of Russia, and by agreement among the\r\nEuropean Powers, united by a common sympathy and in face of a common\r\ndanger, the German Field-Marshal, Count Waldersee, was appointed to\r\nthe supreme command of all the European forces. At the same time naval\r\nsupports were hurried by all maritime nations to the scene, and within\r\na short period 160 warships and 30 torpedo boats were assembled off\r\nthe Chinese coast.\r\n\r\nThe march to Pekin and the relief of the imprisoned Europeans are\r\nincidents still fresh in public memory. In the crowded British\r\nLegation fear alternated with hope, and hope with fear, until, on the\r\nforenoon of August 14th, a boy ran into the Legation crying that\r\n\"black-faced Europeans\" were advancing along the royal canal in the\r\ndirection of the building. In a few minutes a company of Sikh cavalry,\r\npart of some Indian troops diverted on their way to Aden, galloped up,\r\nall danger was over, and the refugees were saved.\r\n\r\nThe Boxer troubles ended on May 13, 1901, with the signature by Li\r\nHung Chang in the name of the Emperor of China of a treaty of peace,\r\nthe main conditions of which were the payment by China within thirty\r\nyears of a war indemnity to the Powers of 450 million taels\r\n(£66,000,000) and an agreement to send a mission of atonement to the\r\nCourts of Germany and Japan--for among the foreign victims of the\r\nBoxers in the previous year had been the Japanese representative in\r\nChina, Baron Sugiyama.\r\n\r\nFor two or three weeks the action of the Emperor with regard to the\r\nChinese mission of atonement brought him into universal ridicule.\r\nPrince Chun, a near relative of the Chinese Emperor, who had been\r\nappointed to conduct the mission, reached Basle in September, 1901, on\r\nhis way to Berlin. Here he lingered, and it soon became known that a\r\nhitch had occurred in his relations with Germany. It then transpired\r\nthat the delay was caused by the Emperor's having suddenly intimated\r\nthat he expected Prince Chun to make thrice to him, as he sat on his\r\nthrone at Potsdam, the \"kotow\" as practised in the Court of China. In\r\nview of the surprise, laughter, and criticism of Europe, the Emperor\r\nmodified his demand for the \"kotow\" to its symbolic performance by\r\nthree deep bows. Prince Chun thereupon resumed his journey. An\r\nimpressive, if theatrical, scene was prepared in the New Palace at\r\nPotsdam, where the Emperor, seated on the throne, his marshal's baton\r\nin his hand, and flanked by Ministers and the officers of his\r\nhousehold, received the bearer of China's expressions of regret.\r\nWhatever one may think of the scenic effect provided, the reply the\r\nEmperor made to Prince Chun, after the three bows arranged upon had\r\nbeen made, is a model of its kind--general not personal, sorrowful\r\nrather than angry, warning rather than reproachful. The Emperor said--\r\n\r\n     \"No pleasing nor festive cause, no mere fulfilment of a\r\n     courtly duty, has brought your Imperial Highness to me, but\r\n     a sad and deeply grave occurrence. My Minister to the Court\r\n     of his Majesty the Emperor of China, Freiherr von Ketteler,\r\n     fell in the Chinese capital beneath the murderous weapons of\r\n     an imperial Chinese soldier, who acted by the orders of a\r\n     superior, an unheard-of outrage condemned by the law of\r\n     nations and the moral sense of all countries. From your\r\n     Imperial Highness I have now heard the expression of the\r\n     sincere and deep regret of his Imperial Majesty the Emperor\r\n     of China regarding the occurrence. I am glad to believe that\r\n     your Imperial Highness's royal brother had nothing to do\r\n     with the crime or with the further acts of violence against\r\n     inviolable Ministers and peaceful foreigners, but all the\r\n     greater is the guilt which attaches to his advisers and his\r\n     Government. Let these not deceive themselves by supposing\r\n     that they can make atonement and receive pardon for their\r\n     crime through this mission alone, and not through their\r\n     subsequent conduct in the light of the prescriptions of\r\n     international law and the moral principles of civilized\r\n     peoples. If his Majesty the Emperor of China henceforward\r\n     directs the government of his great Empire in the spirit of\r\n     these ordinances, his hope that the sad consequences of the\r\n     confusion of last year may be overcome, and permanent,\r\n     peaceful and friendly relations between Germany and China\r\n     may exist as before, will be realized to the benefit of both\r\n     peoples and the whole of civilized humanity. In the sincere\r\n     wish that it may be so, I welcome your Imperial Highness.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's other speeches referring to the Boxer movement at this\r\nperiod have been adversely commented on as showing him in the light of\r\na cruel and blood-thirsty seeker after revenge. This is an unjust, at\r\nleast a hard, judgment. A passage in his address at Bremerhaven to the\r\nexpeditionary force when setting out for China is the main proof of\r\nthe charge--in which, after referring to the murder of von Ketteler,\r\nhe said:\r\n\r\n     \"You know well you will have to fight with a cunning, brave,\r\n     well-armed, cruel foe. When you come to close quarters with\r\n     him remember--quarter ('Pardon' is the German word the\r\n     Emperor used) must not be given: prisoners must not be\r\n     taken: manage your weapons so that for a thousand years to\r\n     come no Chinaman will dare to look sideways at a German. Act\r\n     like men.\"\r\n\r\nIt is difficult, of course, to reconcile such an address with\r\nChristian humanity practised, so far as humanity can be practised, in\r\nmodern war, but it should be remembered that the Emperor was speaking\r\nin a state of great excitement, and that, according to Chancellor\r\nPrince Bülow's statement in the Reichstag subsequently, confirmation\r\nof the news of the murder of his Minister to China had only reached\r\nthe Emperor ten minutes before he delivered the speech.\r\n\r\nThere is one incident, however, though not a very important one, in\r\nconnexion with the troubles, which may fairly be made a matter of\r\nreproach to the Emperor--the seizure, on his order, of the ancient\r\nastronomical instruments at Pekin and their transference to Sans\r\nSouci, in Potsdam, where they are to be seen to the present day. The\r\ntroops of all nations, it is known, looted freely at Pekin; but the\r\nEmperor might have spared China and his own fair fame the indignity of\r\nsuch public vandalism.\r\n\r\nWhile writing of China it may not be superfluous to add that the\r\nEmperor's foreign policy in the Orient cannot be expected to present\r\nexactly the same features, or proceed quite along the same lines, as\r\nhis foreign policy in Europe. By far the greater part of Europe is now\r\nas completely parcelled out and as permanently settled as though it\r\nwere a huge, well-managed estate. The capacities of its high roads,\r\nits railways, its great rivers, with their commercial and strategic\r\nvalues and relations are perfectly ascertained; and the knowledge, it\r\nis not too much to say, is the common property of all important\r\nGovernments. It is not so, or not nearly to the same extent, in the\r\nOrient. In Europe there is little or no difficulty in distinguishing\r\nbetween enterprises that are political and those that are commercial,\r\nor in recognizing where they are both; and if a difficulty should\r\narise it can be arranged by diplomatic conversations, by a conference\r\nof the Powers interested, or in the last resort--short of war--by\r\narbitration. This is not so simple a matter in the Orient, where\r\nconditions are at once old and new, where interests of possibly great\r\nmagnitude are as yet undetermined or unappropriated, where possibly\r\ngreat mineral sources are undeveloped and the capacities of new\r\nmarkets unascertained; where, in short, the decisive factors of the\r\nproblem are undiscovered, it may be unsuspected.\r\n\r\nIn such cases there is often no certain and readily recognizable line\r\nof demarcation between the two kinds of enterprise; and an undertaking\r\nthat may present all the appearance of being a purely commercial\r\nscheme, and be solemnly asseverated to be such by the Power or Powers\r\npromoting it, may turn out on closer examination to be one of great\r\npolitical significance and incalculable political consequence. Of such\r\nenterprises two immediately spring to mind, the Cape to Cairo railway\r\nand the Baghdad railway, not to mention a score of problematic\r\nundertakings in other parts of Africa or Asia. It will be useful to\r\nkeep this general consideration in view when forming an opinion\r\nregarding the Emperor's Oriental policy. That policy is, so far,\r\nalmost entirely commercial. Long ago wars used to be made for the sake\r\nof religion, then for the sake of territory. Now they are made for the\r\nsake of new markets.\r\n\r\nYet the Far East is changing with the change in conditions everywhere\r\nin modern times, and it is evident that the premises for any\r\nconclusion as to German foreign policy there may, at any given moment,\r\nbe subject to modification. Partly owing to the growth of Germany's\r\nEuropean influence, and to the increase in her navy which has helped\r\nher to it, she is to be found of recent years playing a role in the\r\nFar East which would have been unintelligible to the German of the\r\nlast generation. There are many Germans to-day, as in Bismarck's time,\r\nwho ridicule the notion that the possibilities of trade in Oriental\r\ncountries justify the national risk now run for it and the national\r\nexpenditure now made upon it; but it is sometimes forgotten that,\r\napart from the chance of obtaining concessions for the building of\r\nrailways, for the establishment of banks, for the leasing of mines and\r\nworking of cotton plantations, there is a large German export of\r\nbeads, cloth, and, in short, of hundreds of articles which appeal to\r\nbarbarian or only semi-civilized tastes.\r\n\r\nGermany, too, looks hopefully forward to a future in which she will be\r\nsupplied with the raw material of her manufactures by her colonies, or\r\nfailing that by her subjects trading abroad in the colonies of other\r\nnations. This is one of the main objects of her Weltpolitik. As Prince\r\nvon Bülow said: \"The time has passed when the German left the earth to\r\none neighbour and the sea to another, while he reserved heaven, where\r\npure doctrines are enthroned, to himself;\" and again: \"We don't seek\r\nto put anybody in the shade, but we demand our place in the sun;\" and\r\nthe idea finds technical expression in the phrase on which Germany\r\nlays so much stress, the \"maintenance of the open door.\" Her policy in\r\nthe Far East, as in Europe, is thus on the whole a commercial one; she\r\nseeks there as elsewhere new markets, not new territory. Accordingly\r\nshe supports the principle of the _status quo_ in China, and therefore\r\nraised no objection to the Anglo-Japanese Agreement of 1902 which,\r\namong other objects, secured it.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1901, the Emperor was called to England by the sudden,\r\nand, as it was to prove, fatal illness of his grandmother, Queen\r\nVictoria. His journey to Osborne, where he arrived just in time to be\r\nrecognized by the dying Queen, and his abandonment of the idea,\r\nimpressive and almost sacred to a Prussian King and the Prussian\r\npeople, of being present on his birthday, January 27th, at the\r\nbicentenary celebration of the foundation of the Prussian Kingdom,\r\nmade a deep and sympathetic impression on the people of England.\r\nUsually on State occasions the Emperor does not display a countenance\r\nof good humour, or indeed of any sentiment save perhaps that of a\r\nsense of dignity; but on the occasion in question, as he rode in the\r\nuniform of a British Field-Marshal beside Edward VII, his looks were\r\nthose of genuine sorrow. Public sympathy was not lessened when it\r\nbecame known that he had mentioned the pride he felt in being\r\nprivileged to wear the uniform of two such soldiers of renown as the\r\nDuke of Wellington and Lord Roberts; and added that the privilege\r\nwould be highly estimated by the whole German army. It was a\r\nchivalrous remark, the offspring of a chivalrous disposition.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had hardly returned to Germany when, on February 6th, the\r\nonly attack ever made on his person occurred in Bremen. He had been at\r\na banquet in the town hall, and was being driven through the\r\nilluminated streets to the railway station to return to Berlin, when a\r\nhalf-witted locksmith's apprentice of nineteen, Dietrich Weiland by\r\nname, flung a piece of railway iron at him with such good aim that it\r\nstruck him on the face immediately under the right eye, inflicting a\r\ndeep and nasty, but not dangerous wound. The Emperor proceeded with\r\nhis journey, the doctors attending to his injury in the train, and in\r\na few weeks he was well again. Weiland was sent to a criminal lunatic\r\nasylum. The attempt had, apparently, nothing to do with Anarchism or\r\nNihilism or the Social Democracy. When the Emperor alluded to it\r\nafterwards in his speech to the Diet, he referred it to a general\r\ndiminution of respect for authority.\r\n\r\n\"Respect for authority,\" he said to the Diet,\r\n\r\n     \"is wanting. In this regard all classes of the population\r\n     are to blame. Particular interests are looked to, not the\r\n     general well-being of the folk. Criticism of the measures of\r\n     the Government and Throne takes the coarsest and most\r\n     injurious forms--and hence the errors and demoralization of\r\n     our youth. Parliament must help here, and a change must be\r\n     made, beginning with the schools.\"\r\n\r\nIt was natural enough that a few days after, addressing the Alexander\r\nRegiment of Guards, who were taking up quarters in a new barracks near\r\nthe palace in Berlin, he should tell them the barracks were like a\r\ncitadel to the palace, and that, as a sort of imperial bodyguard, the\r\nregiment \"must be ready, day and night as once before\"--he was\r\nreferring to the \"March Days\"--\"to meet any attack by the citizens on\r\nthe Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nAt Bonn in April the Emperor attended the matriculation\r\n(immatriculation, the Germans call it) of his eldest son, the Crown\r\nPrince, at the university. He was in civil dress, one of the rare\r\npublic occasions during the reign when he has not been in uniform, but\r\nthis did not prevent him delivering a martial address to the\r\nBorussians. \"I hope and expect from the younger generation,\" he said\r\nto the students,\r\n\r\n     \"that they will put me in a position to maintain our German\r\n     Fatherland in its close and strong boundaries and in the\r\n     congeries of German races--doing to no one favour and to no\r\n     one harm. If, however, anyone should touch us too nearly,\r\n     then I will call upon you and I expect you won't leave your\r\n     Emperor sitting.\"\r\n\r\nA great shout of \"Bravo!\" went up when the Emperor ceased, and the\r\nstudents doubtless all thought what a fine thing it would be if he\r\nwould only lead them straightway against those cheeky Englanders.\r\n\r\nAt the end of June, on board the Hamburg-American pleasure-steamer\r\n_Princess Victoria Luise_, the Emperor pronounced the famous\r\nsentence--\"Our future lies on the water.\" The year before he had said\r\nsomething like it, and it is worth quoting as the Emperor's first\r\nexplicit allusion to Weltpolitik. \"Strongly,\" he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n     \"dashes the beat of ocean at the doors of our people and\r\n     compels it to preservation of its place in the world, in a\r\n     word, to Weltpolitik. The ocean is indispensable for\r\n     Germany's greatness. The ocean testifies that on it and far\r\n     beyond it no important decision will be taken without\r\n     Germany and the German Emperor.\"\r\n\r\nHis words on the present occasion were:\r\n\r\n     \"My entire task for the future will be to see that the\r\n     undertakings of which the foundations have been laid may\r\n     develop quietly and surely. We have, though as yet without\r\n     the fleet as it should be, achieved our place in the sun. It\r\n     will now be my task to hold this place unquestioned, so that\r\n     its rays may act favourably on trade and industry and\r\n     agriculture at home inside, and on our sail-sports on the\r\n     coast--for our future lies on the water. The more Germans go\r\n     on the sea--whether travelling or in the service of the\r\n     State--the better. When the German has once learned to look\r\n     abroad and afar he will lose that 'hang' towards the petty,\r\n     the trivial, which now so often seizes him in daily life.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he closed: \"We must now go out in search of new spots where we can\r\ndrive in nails on which to hang our armour.\"\r\n\r\nEarly in August the Emperor was called to the death-bed of his mother,\r\nthe Empress Frederick, at her castle in Cronberg. She died on the\r\nafternoon of her son's arrival, on August 5th. The Emperor ordered\r\nmourning throughout the Empire for six weeks, and forbade all \"public\r\nmusic, entertainments, theatrical or otherwise\" until after the\r\nfuneral. The Empress was buried in the mausoleum attached to the\r\nFriedenskirche in Potsdam on the 13th of the month.\r\n\r\nThe delivery of a famous speech on art by the Emperor in December\r\nbrings the chronicle of 1901 to a close, but perhaps it will not\r\ndisplease the reader if a new chapter is opened for the purpose of\r\nquoting it and of considering the Emperor in what is a traditional\r\nHohenzollern relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR AND THE ARTS\r\n\r\nArt is a favourite subject of conversation on the Continent, where it\r\nis more popularly discussed than in England and where authorities of\r\nall kinds are more alive to its educative capabilities. It is\r\neminently \"safe\" ground, does not savour of gossip, and no one need\r\nleave the field of discussion with the feeling that he has been driven\r\nfrom it. Hence it is the salvation of diplomatists who are\r\napprehensive of committing their Governments or themselves when mixing\r\nin general society, and it doubtless does good service for the Emperor\r\nalso upon occasion. Indeed it is a topic on which he speaks willingly\r\nand well.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately for precision of thought and speech, though useful for\r\nthe man in the street, the word \"art\" has been pressed into the\r\nservice of metaphor more than almost any other word in language. We\r\nare told in turn that everything is an art--hair-dressing,\r\nsalad-dressing (a different kind), lying, flying, dying. The Germans\r\nare trying to make an art of life. Whistler wrote about the \"Gentle\r\nArt of Making Enemies.\" One hears of \"artful hussies\" and \"artful\r\ndodgers.\" People are described as \"artful\" in the small diplomacies of\r\nintercourse. Jugglers, acrobats, sword-swallowers, \"supers\" at the\r\ntheatre, the men who play the elephant in the pantomime would all be\r\nmortified if they were not addressed as \"artists,\" In short,\r\neverything may be called an art.\r\n\r\nBut what, truly, is art? The question is as hard to answer\r\nsatisfactorily as the questions what is truth or what is beauty? The\r\nnotion \"art\" usually occurs to the mind as contrasted with the notion\r\n\"nature\"; the word is derived from the Sanskrit root _ar_, to plough,\r\nto make, to do; and accordingly art may be taken to be something made\r\nby man, as contrasted with something made, or grown, or given by God.\r\nHow art came into existence it is of course impossible to do more than\r\nconjecture. The necessities of primitive man may have stimulated his\r\ninventive powers into originating and developing the useful arts for\r\nhis physical comfort and convenience; and his desire for recreation\r\nafter labour, or the mere ennui of idleness, may have urged the same\r\npowers into originating and developing the fine and plastic arts for\r\nthe entertainment of his mind. Or, lastly, if no better reason can be\r\nfound, and though Sir Joshua Reynolds laid it down that all models of\r\nperfection in art must be sought for on the earth, it may be that\r\nseeing and feeling instinctively the glory and beauty of the Creation,\r\nmankind began gradually, as its intelligence improved, to burn with a\r\nlonging to imitate, reproduce, and represent them.\r\n\r\nHowever art arose, it seems true to say, as a German writer has well\r\nsaid, that when a work of art, whether a poem or a picture or a\r\nstatue, causes in us the thought that so, and in no other way, would\r\nwe ourselves have expressed the idea, had we the talent, then we may\r\nconclude that true art is speaking to us, whatever the idea to be\r\nexpressed may be. Everything demands thought, but our thoughts are an\r\nunruly folk, which never keep long on the same straight road, and love\r\nto wander off to left and right, here finding something new and there\r\nthrowing away something old. The artist, when he conceives a plan, has\r\nto fight with the host of his thoughts and find a way through them.\r\nThey often threaten to divert him from it, but on the other hand they\r\noften lead him to his goal by novel paths along which he finds much\r\nthat is new and valuable.\r\n\r\nThis is a doctrine that, sensible though it is, would hardly be\r\nsubscribed to by the Emperor, to whom no new movement in art strongly\r\nappeals, and who thinks that such movements, unless founded on the old\r\nclassical school, the Greek and Roman school of beauty, ought, in the\r\npublic interest, to be discouraged. However, let him speak for\r\nhimself. He set forth his art creed in a speech which he delivered on\r\nDecember 18, 1901, to the sculptors who had executed the Hohenzollern\r\nstatues in the famous Siegesallée at Berlin, and which ran\r\nsubstantially as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I gladly seize the occasion, first of all, to express my\r\n     congratulations and then my thanks for the manner in which\r\n     you have assisted me to carry out my original plan. The\r\n     preparation of the plan for the Siegesallée has occupied\r\n     many years, and the learned historiographer of my House,\r\n     Professor Dr. Poser, is the man who put me in a position to\r\n     set the artists clear and intelligible tasks. Once the\r\n     historic basis was found the work could be proceeded with,\r\n     and when the personalities of the princes were established\r\n     it was possible to ascertain those who had been their most\r\n     important helpers. In this manner the groups originated and,\r\n     to a certain extent, conditioned by their history, the forms\r\n     of them came into existence.\r\n\r\n     \"The next most difficult question was--Was it possible, as I\r\n     hoped it was, to find in Berlin so many artists as would be\r\n     able to work together harmoniously to realize the programme?\r\n\r\n     \"As I came to consider the question, I had in view to show\r\n     the world that the most favourable condition for the\r\n     successful achievement of the work was not the appointment\r\n     of an art commission and the establishment of prize\r\n     competitions, but that in accord with ancient custom, as in\r\n     the classical period, and later during the Middle Ages, was\r\n     the case, it lay in the direct intercourse of the employer\r\n     with the artists.\r\n\r\n     \"I am therefore especially obliged to Professor Reinhold\r\n     Begas for having assured me, when I applied to him, that\r\n     there was absolutely no doubt there could be found in Berlin\r\n     a sufficiency of artists to carry out the idea; and with his\r\n     help, and in consequence of the acquaintances I have made by\r\n     visiting exhibitions and studios in Berlin, I succeeded in\r\n     getting together a staff, the majority of whom I see around\r\n     me, with whom to approach the task.\r\n\r\n     \"I think you will not refuse me the testimony that, in\r\n     respect of the programme I drew up I have made the treatment\r\n     of it as easy as possible, that while I ordered and defined\r\n     the work I gave you an absolute freedom not only in the\r\n     combination and composition, but precisely the freedom to\r\n     put into it that from himself which every artist must if he\r\n     is to give the work the stamp of his own individuality,\r\n     since every work of art contains in itself something of the\r\n     individual character of the artist. I believe that this\r\n     experiment, if I may so call it, as made in the Siegesallée,\r\n     has succeeded.\r\n\r\n     \"... I have never interfered with details, but have\r\n     contented myself with simply giving the direction, the\r\n     impulse.\r\n\r\n     \"But to-day the thought that Berlin stands there before the\r\n     whole world with a guild of artists able to carry out so\r\n     magnificent a project fills me with satisfaction and pride.\r\n     It shows that the Berlin school of art stands on a height\r\n     which could hardly have been more splendid in the time of\r\n     the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n     \"Here, too, one can draw a parallel between the great\r\n     artistic achievements of the Middle Ages and the\r\n     Italians--that, namely, the head of the State, an art-loving\r\n     prince, who offered their tasks to the artists also found\r\n     the master round whom a school of artists could gather.\r\n\r\n     \"How is it, generally speaking, with art in the world? It\r\n     takes its models, supplies itself from the great sources of\r\n     Mother Nature, who, spite of her apparently unfettered,\r\n     limitless freedom, still moves according to eternal laws\r\n     which the Creator ordained for himself and which cannot be\r\n     passed or violated without danger to the development of the\r\n     world.\r\n\r\n     \"Even so it is in art; and at the sight of the beautiful\r\n     remains of old classical times comes again over one the\r\n     feeling that here too reigns an eternal law that is always\r\n     true to itself, the law of beauty and harmony, of the\r\n     aesthetic. This law is given expression to by the ancients\r\n     in so surprising and overpowering a fashion, in so\r\n     thoroughly complete a form that we, with all our modern\r\n     sensibilities and with all our power, are still proud, when\r\n     we have done any specially fine piece of work, to hear that\r\n     it is almost as good as it was made nineteen hundred years\r\n     ago.\r\n\r\n     \"But only almost! Under this impression I would earnestly\r\n     ask you to lay it to heart that sculpture still remains\r\n     untainted by so-called modern tendencies and currents--still\r\n     stands high and chastely there! Keep her so, don't let\r\n     yourselves be misled by human criticism or any wind of\r\n     doctrine to abandon the principles on which she has been\r\n     built up.\r\n\r\n     \"An art which transgresses the laws and limits I have\r\n     indicated is art no more. It is factory work, handicraft,\r\n     and that is a thing art should never be. Under the often\r\n     misused word 'freedom' and her flag one falls too readily\r\n     into boundlessness, unrestraint, self-exaggeration. For\r\n     whoever cuts loose from the law of beauty, and the feeling\r\n     for the æsthetic and harmonious, which every human breast\r\n     feels, whether he can express it or not, and in his thought\r\n     makes his chief object some special direction, some specific\r\n     solution of more technical tasks, that man denies art's\r\n     first sources.\r\n\r\n     \"Yet again. Art should help to exercise an educative\r\n     influence on the people. She should offer the lower classes,\r\n     after the hard work of the day, the possibility of\r\n     refreshing themselves by regarding what is ideal. To us\r\n     Germans great ideals have become permanent possessions,\r\n     whereas to other peoples they have been more or less lost.\r\n     Only the German people remain called to preserve these great\r\n     ideas, to cultivate and continue them. And among these\r\n     ideals is this, that we afford the possibility to the\r\n     working classes to elevate themselves by beauty, and by\r\n     beauty to enable them to abstract themselves and rise above\r\n     the thoughts they otherwise would have.\r\n\r\n     \"When Art, as now often occurs, does nothing more than\r\n     represent misery as still more unlovely than it is already,\r\n     by so doing she sins against the German people. The\r\n     cultivation of the ideal is at the same time the greatest\r\n     work of culture, and if we wish to be and remain an example\r\n     in this to other nations the whole people must work together\r\n     to that end; if Culture is to fulfil her task she must\r\n     penetrate to the lowest classes of society. That she can\r\n     only do when art comes into play, when she raises up,\r\n     instead of descending into the gutter.\r\n\r\n     \"As ruler of the country I often find it extremely bitter\r\n     that art, through its masters, does not with sufficient\r\n     energy oppose such tendencies. I do not for a moment fail to\r\n     perceive that many an aspiring character is to be found\r\n     among the partisans of these tendencies, who are perhaps\r\n     filled with the best intentions but who are on the wrong\r\n     path. The true artist needs no advertisement, no press, no\r\n     patronage. I do not believe that your great protagonists in\r\n     the domain of science, either in ancient Greece or in Italy\r\n     or in the Renaissance period ever had recourse to a\r\n     _réclame_ such as nowadays is often made in the press in\r\n     order to bring their ideas into prominence, but worked as\r\n     God inspired them and let others do the talking.\r\n\r\n     \"And so must an honest, proper artist act. The art which\r\n     descends to _réclame_ is no art be it lauded a hundred or a\r\n     thousand-fold. A feeling for what is beautiful or ugly has\r\n     every one, be he ever so simple, and to educate this feeling\r\n     in the people I require all of you. That in the Siegesallée\r\n     you have done a piece of such work, I have specially to\r\n     thank you.\r\n\r\n     \"This I can even now tell you--the impression which the\r\n     Siegesallée has made on the foreigner is quite an\r\n     overpowering one; everywhere respect for German sculpture is\r\n     making itself perceivable. May you always remain on these\r\n     heights, may such masters stand by my sons and sons' sons,\r\n     should they ever come into existence! Then, I am convinced,\r\n     will our people be in a position to love the beautiful and\r\n     honour lofty ideals.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Berlin Art Museum next year, after praising the devotion of his\r\nparents to art, and especially of his mother, \"a nature,\" he said,\r\n\"about which poesy breathed,\" he continued:--\r\n\r\n     \"The son of both stands before you as their heir and\r\n     executor: and so I regard it as my task, according to the\r\n     intention of my parents, to hold my hand over my German\r\n     people and its growing generation, to foster the love of\r\n     beauty in them, and to develop art in them; but only along\r\n     the lines and within the bounds drawn strictly by the\r\n     feelings in mankind for beauty and harmony.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's speech to the sculptors, if it contains some\r\nquestionable statements, is a thoughtful address by one who is himself\r\nan artist, though not perhaps an artist of a high class. His artistic\r\nendowments, transmitted from his parents, have been already indicated.\r\nIn reference to them he said to the official conducting him over the\r\nMarienburg in later years, when the official expressed surprise at the\r\nEmperor's art-knowledge:--\r\n\r\n     \"There is nothing wonderful in it. I was brought up in an\r\n     artistic atmosphere. My mother was an artist, and from my\r\n     earliest youth I have been surrounded by beautiful things.\r\n     Art is my friend and my recreation.\"\r\n\r\nThe highest praise of a work of art is to say of it that it pleased,\r\nor would have pleased; his mother. Of her he said, \"Every thought she\r\nhad was art, and to her everything, however simple, which was meant\r\nfor the use of life, was penetrated with beauty.\" When giving his\r\nsanction to a plan, a park, a statue or a building he always\r\nthinks--\"Would it have pleased my parents--what would they have said\r\nabout it?\" The Kaiser Friedrich Museum and the Kaiser Friedrich\r\nMemorial Church, both in Berlin, testify to the Emperor's gratitude to\r\nhis parents for their artistic legacy.\r\n\r\nHe went, as we have seen, through the ordinary art drudgery of the\r\nschool, recognizing, no doubt, with Michael Angelo, with all good\r\nartists, that correct drawing is the foundation of every art into\r\nwhich drawing enters and applying himself industriously to it. As a\r\nyoung soldier at Potsdam he spent a good deal of his time, during the\r\nthree years from 1880 to 1883, practising oil-painting under the\r\nguidance of Herr Karl Salzmann, a distinguished Berlin painter. Among\r\nthe results of this instruction was a picture which the princely\r\nartist called \"The Corvette--Prince Adalbert in the Bay of Samitsu,\"\r\nnow hanging in the residence of his brother, Prince Henry, at Kiel;\r\nand two years later, as his interest in the navy grew, a \"Fight\r\nbetween an Armoured Ship and a Torpedo-boat.\" Innumerable aquarelles\r\nand sketches, chiefly of marine subjects, were also the fruit of this\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor has constantly cultivated free and friendly intercourse\r\nwith the best artists of his own and other nations, and been\r\ncontinually engaged devoting time and money to the art education of\r\nhis people. The admirable art exhibitions in Berlin of the best\r\nexamples of painting by English, French, and American artists, which\r\nhe personally promoted and was greatly interested in, may be recalled\r\nas instances. If his efforts in encouraging art among his people have\r\nnot been so successful as his imperial activities in other directions,\r\nthe reason is not any fault on his part, but simply that art refuses\r\nto be, in Shakespeare's phrase, \"tongue-tied by authority.\"\r\n\r\nThis was shown by the chorus of unfavourable criticism which the\r\nspeech to the sculptors drew forth. No one questioned the sincerity of\r\nthe Emperor or the magnanimity of his aims, nor was the criticism\r\nwholly caused by the suspicion that it savoured of the \"personal\r\nregiment\" under which the people were growing impatient; but many\r\nthought he was pushing the dynastic principle too far and unduly\r\ninterfering with liberty of thought and judgment, and that there was\r\nsomething Oriental as well as selfish in occupying with a gallery of\r\nhis ancestors, the majority of whom were, after all, very ordinary\r\npeople, one of the fairest spots in the capital. Perhaps, however,\r\nwhat was most objected to was his trying to drive the art of the\r\nnation into a groove, the direction given by himself: in trying to\r\ninspire it with a particular spirit and that an ancient not a modern\r\nspirit, when he ought to let the spirit come of its own accord out of\r\nthe mind of the people--the mind of many millions, not the mind of one\r\nman, however high his rank. Politics and government might be things in\r\nwhich he had a right to an authoritative voice, but art, like\r\nreligion, the people considered to be a matter for individual taste\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\nYet something may be advanced in favour of the Emperor. His\r\nrecommendation, for in fact it was and could be only that, was quite\r\nin keeping with the traditions of his office and the people's own view\r\nof royal government. The speech, as was admitted, was suggested by no\r\nmere dilettante's vanity, but, as is evident from his words at the Art\r\nMuseum, by the conviction that just as it is the imperial duty to\r\nprovide an efficient army and navy, so it is the imperial duty to use\r\nevery personal and private, as well as every public and official,\r\neffort to provide the people with an art as efficient, as honest, and\r\nas clean; and it was inevitable that the art the Emperor recommended\r\nwas that which he believed, and still believes, to be in conformity\r\nwith the ideals, as he interprets them, or would have them to be, of\r\nthe Germanic race.\r\n\r\nThe speech itself is interesting as showing the Emperor's attitude\r\ntowards art and artists and his personal conception of art and its\r\nnature. His attitude is evidently that of the art-loving prince of\r\nwhom he speaks in the address, a royal Maecenas or di Medici, who\r\ngathers artists round him; but he means to use them, not so much\r\nperhaps for art's sake, as for the instruction and elevation of his\r\nfolk. A very laudable aim; only, as it happens, the folk in this\r\nmatter desire themselves to decide what is improving and elevating for\r\nthem and what is not. They are not willing to leave the exclusive\r\nchoice to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, again, would give the artist the freedom to put into his\r\nwork \"that from himself which any artist must, if he is to give the\r\nwork the stamp of his own individuality.\" This attitude, too, is\r\nadmirable, but on the other hand lies the danger, such is poor human\r\nnature, that the individuality will be that which the Emperor wishes\r\nit to be, not the artist's independent individuality To the foreign\r\neye all the Hohenzollern statues in the Siegesallee, with the\r\nexception possibly of two or three, seem to have much the same\r\nindividuality, though that again may be due to the nature of the\r\nsubject and the foreigner's inherent and ineradicable predispositions.\r\n\r\nThirdly, art, the Emperor says, can only be educative when it elevates\r\ninstead of descending into the gutter. Hogarth descended into the\r\ngutter. Gustav Doré depicts the horrors of hell. Yet both Hogarth and\r\nDoré were great artists, and educative too. The Emperor was here\r\nthinking of the Berlin Secession, a school just then starting,\r\neccentric indeed and far from \"classical,\" but which nevertheless has\r\nsince produced several fine artists. The Emperor, it would appear,\r\nthinks that the antique classical school is the true and only good\r\nschool for the artist. Very likely most artists will agree with him--\r\nat least as a foundation; but the belief, it also appears, is not\r\nconsidered in Germany, or outside of it, to justify the Emperor, as\r\nEmperor, in discouraging all other schools and particularly the\r\nefforts of modern artists in their non-classical imaginings.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor says art \"takes its models, supplies itself from the great\r\nsources of Mother Nature.\" With all courtesy to the Emperor one may\r\nsuggest that art, and sane art, takes its models not only from Mother\r\nNature, but also from an almost as prolific a maternal source, namely\r\nimagination; and that imagination is limited by no eternal laws we\r\nknow of, or can even suspect. Accordingly it is useless to check, or\r\ntry to check, the imagination by telling it to work in a certain\r\ndirection--so long, naturally, as the imagination is not obviously\r\nindecent or insane.\r\n\r\nAgain, the Emperor says that in classical art there reigns an eternal\r\nlaw, the \"law of beauty and harmony, of the aesthetic\" which is\r\nexpressed in a \"thoroughly complete form\" by the ancients. It is\r\nadmittedly a delightful and admirable form, but is it thoroughly\r\ncomplete? Is it the last and only form; and may not the very same law\r\nbe found by experiment to be at work in future art that cannot be\r\ncalled classical, as it was found to be at work in the various noble\r\nschools since classical times? One must agree with the Emperor that\r\nthe Greeks and Romans illustrated the \"law of beauty and harmony, of\r\nthe esthetic, in a wonderful manner.\" But it was wonderfully done for\r\ntheir age and intellect. They did not exhaust the beautiful and\r\nharmonious: far from it.\r\n\r\nNeither the world nor mankind has been standing still ever since;\r\ncertainly the mind of man has not, even though his senses have\r\nundergone no elemental change. Paganism was succeeded by Christianity,\r\nand with Christianity came a new art canon, new forms of beauty and\r\nharmony--the Early Italian. The age of reason followed, bringing with\r\nit the Baroque and Rococo canons: and as time went on, and the world's\r\nmind kept working, came other canons still. The most recent canon\r\nappears to be that of naturalism (the Emperor's \"gutter \") with which\r\nartists are now experimentalizing. None of the canons, be it noticed,\r\ndestroyed the canon that preceded, because beauty and harmony are\r\nindestructible and imperishable. \"A thing of beauty is a joy for\r\never.\"\r\n\r\nBut not only the mind of man kept changing: the world itself and its\r\ncivilization--by war, by treaty, by science, by invention, by art\r\nitself--kept changing, and is changing now. Development, physical as\r\nwell as social, has been constant, and the changes accompanying it\r\nhave inspired, and are inspiring, artists with new ideas to which they\r\nare always trying to give expression. The subjects of art have\r\nenormously multiplied. Those introduced by sport of all kinds, by the\r\ndevelopment of the theatre, by the newly-found effects of light and\r\ncolour, need only be mentioned as examples capable of suggesting\r\nbeauties and harmonies unknown to and unsuspected by the ancients.\r\nHence, in addition to the classical art of the day, there is room for\r\nthe \"new art,\" the secessionist, the futurist, the impressionist, even\r\nthe cubist, or whatever the experimental movement may call itself. And\r\nany day any of these movements may lead to the establishment of a new\r\nand admirable school of genuine art as beautiful as the classical, if\r\nin a different manner. The world has no idea of the surprises in all\r\ndirections yet in store for it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, too, is at one with all the world in assuming that art,\r\nto deserve the name, must possess the quality of beauty. He speaks of\r\n\"beauty and harmony,\" but let it be taken that he understands beauty\r\nto include harmony. Now, as has been suggested, to answer the\r\nquestion, what is beauty, satisfactorily, is no easy matter. In\r\nimmediate proximity to it lies the question, what is ugliness? It\r\nmight be argued that nothing in nature is ugly, and that the word was\r\nintroduced to express what is merely an inability on the part of\r\nmankind to perceive the beauty which constitutes nature; and it\r\ncertainly is possible that, were man endowed with the mind of God,\r\ninstead of with only some infinitesimal and mysterious emanation of\r\nit, he would find all things in creation, all art included, beautiful.\r\nThe author of the Book of Genesis asserts that when God had finished\r\nmaking the world He looked upon His handiwork and saw that it was\r\ngood. There is one advantage in adopting this view, and no small one,\r\nthat a belief in its truth must impel us to look for beauty and\r\ngoodness in all things, whether in art or nature--and even in the\r\nSecession. Perhaps, however, we shall not be far from the truth in\r\nsaying, as regards art, that all things in creation are beautiful,\r\nthat there are degrees in beauty of which ugliness is the lowest, and\r\nthat the truly inspired artist can make all things, ugliness included,\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor thinks the appreciation of beauty is one of our innate\r\nideas, like the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, which\r\nwe call conscience. There is no agreement among thinkers on the point,\r\nand it may be that both beauty and conscience are relative, and simply\r\nthe result of environment and education. Certainly there is no\r\nstandard of beauty, and more certainly still, not of feminine beauty.\r\nThe Mahommedan admires a woman who has the nose of the parrot, the\r\nteeth of the pomegranate seed, and the tread of the elephant.\r\n\r\nBut though there is no complete standard of beauty about which all\r\npeople, at all times, in all countries, are agreed, there are two\r\nelements of beauty which may be said to have been standardized, at\r\nleast for the civilized world, by the early Greeks and Romans. These\r\nelements are simplicity and harmony, simplicity being the forms of\r\nthings most directly and pleasingly appealing to the eye and most\r\neasily reaching the common understanding, while harmony is the\r\ncombination of parts most nearly identical with the lines, contours,\r\nand proportions of nature. These are two essentials of good sculpture,\r\nand the Emperor was talking to sculptors and perhaps thinking only of\r\nsculpture.\r\n\r\nYet simplicity and harmony alone do not constitute beauty, while on\r\nthe other hand beauty may take very complicated forms. A third element\r\none may suggest is essential, and its indescribable nature causes all\r\nthe difficulty there is in defining beauty. This third element\r\nis--charm. A work of art, to be beautiful, must charm, and to\r\ndifferent people different things are charming. Plato's theory is that\r\nthe sense of beauty is a dim recollection of a standard we have seen\r\nin a heavenly pre-existence. Accepting it as as good an explanation of\r\ncharm as we can get, we may conclude by defining beauty as, in its\r\nhighest form, a combination of simplicity and harmony, resulting in\r\ncharm.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor says: \"To us Germans great ideals have become permanent\r\npossessions, whereas to other peoples they have been more or less\r\nlost.\" The remark is not one of those best calculated to promote\r\nfriendly feelings on the part of other peoples towards Germany or its\r\nEmperor. It is like his declaration that Germans are the \"salt of the\r\nearth,\" and of a piece with the aggressive attitude of intellectual\r\nsuperiority adopted by many Germans towards other nations--one reason,\r\nby the way, for German unpopularity in the world. But is it true?\r\nGermany has great ideals in permanent possession, but are they more or\r\nless lost to other peoples? It is at least doubtful. Great ideals are\r\nthe permanent possession of every great people; it is these ideals\r\nthat have made them great; and they are no less great if they differ\r\naccording to the nature and conditions of each great people. One might\r\ngo further, indeed, and say that great ideals are the common property\r\nand permanent possession of all great peoples. It is a hard saying\r\nthat any one people has a monopoly of them. The contribution of every\r\ngreat nation to the common stock of great ideals is incalculable, and\r\nit would be interesting to investigate which nation is most\r\nsuccessfully working out its great ideals in practice.\r\n\r\nThe truth is the German ideal of beauty in art is not, generally\r\nspeaking, the same as that of the Anglo-Saxon or Latin foreigner. The\r\nart ideals of the Anglo-Saxon and Latin races in this respect are for\r\nthe most part Greek, while those of the German race are for the most\r\npart Roman; and in each case the ideals are the outcome of the spirit\r\nwhich has had most influence on the mind and manners of the different\r\nraces. The Greek philosophic and aesthetic spirit has chiefly\r\ninfluenced Anglo-Saxon and Latin art ideals: the Roman spirit,\r\nparticularly the military spirit and the spirit of law, have chiefly\r\ninfluenced German ideals: and, as a result, arrived at through ages\r\nduring which events of epoch-making importance caused many successive\r\nmodifications, while the Anglo-Saxon and Latin races are most\r\nimpressed by such qualities as lightness and delicacy of outline,\r\nround and softly-flowing curves and elegance of ornamentation, the\r\nGerman appears, to the Anglo-Saxon and Latin, to be more impressed by\r\nthe elaborate, the gigantic, the Gothic, the grotesque, the hard, the\r\nmade, the massive, and the square. In both styles are to be found\r\n\"beauty and harmony, the aesthetic,\" to quote the Emperor, but they\r\nappeal differently to people of different national temperaments. To\r\nthe Anglo-Saxon and Latin in general, therefore, German art, and\r\nparticularly German sculpture and architecture, while impressive and\r\nadmirable, lack for most foreigners the entirely indescribable quality\r\nwe have called \"charm.\"\r\n\r\nThe true artist, the Emperor says, needs no advertisement, no press,\r\nno patronage. The Emperor is right. The true artist, once he begins to\r\nproduce first-rate work, will obtain instant recognition, and his work\r\nwill begin to sell, not perhaps at prices the same kind of work may\r\nbring later, but at prices sufficient to support the artist and his\r\nfamily in reasonable comfort. If it does not, he is not producing good\r\nwork and had better turn his attention to something else. As a matter\r\nof fact very few true artists do advertise, use the press, or seek\r\npatronage. The artist does not go to the press or the patron, for\r\nnowadays, the moment the artist does excellent work, the press and the\r\npatron go to him, and, when he is very exceptionally good, he is\r\nadvertised and patronized until he is sick of both advertisement and\r\npatronage.\r\n\r\nNaturally it is different in the case of the artist who is not\r\nexcellently good, but the Emperor was not considering such. These\r\nartists too, however, insist on living and must find a market for\r\ntheir wares. It is an age of advertisement, the growth of new economic\r\nconditions, for advertisement creates as well as reveals new markets.\r\nHence the vast host of mediocrities, not only in art but in almost\r\nevery field of human activity, nowadays advertise and seek patronage\r\nbecause only in this way can they find purchasers and live. These\r\nartists, often men of talent, dislike having to advertise; they would\r\nrather work for art's sake, but having to do so need not hinder them\r\nfrom working for art's sake, since all that is meant by that much\r\nmisused phrase is that while the artist is working he shall not think\r\nof the reward of his work, but simply and solely of how to do the best\r\nwork he can.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the Emperor's speech one is tempted to inquire what\r\nshould be the attitude of a sovereign towards art and artists. For the\r\nEnglishman the doctrine of Individualism--the thing he is so apt to\r\nmake a fetish of--gives an answer, and, it may be, the right one. The\r\nEnglishman will probably say that if in any one province of life more\r\nthan in another freedom should be allowed to originality of conception\r\nregarding the form as well as the substance, the manner as well as the\r\nmatter, it is in the province of art, always provided, of course, that\r\nthe artist is sane and not guilty of indecency. The artist, like the\r\npoet, is born not made; you cannot make an artist, you can only make\r\nan artisan. The artist, who represents the Creator, the creative\r\nfaculty, can influence man: man cannot, and should not try to,\r\ninfluence the artist, but can, and should only, offer him the\r\nmaterials for his art, smooth the way for his endeavour, encourage him\r\nin it by sympathetic yet candid criticism, and above all, when he can\r\nafford it, by buying the result of his endeavour when it is\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThis should be the attitude of both monarch and Maecenas: it is an\r\nattitude of benevolent neutrality. \"I know,\" such a Maecenas might say\r\nto the artist,\r\n\r\n     \"that your artistic faculties move in an atmosphere above as\r\n     well as on the earth, as I know that above the atmosphere of\r\n     oxygen and hydrogen which envelops the earth there is an\r\n     ethereal, a rarefied atmosphere, which stretches to worlds\r\n     of which all we know is that they exist. If your spirit can\r\n     soar above this earthly atmosphere, well and good. I, for\r\n     one, shall do nothing to limit or hinder it: I shall only\r\n     welcome and applaud and reward whatever effort you make to\r\n     bring our inner being a step, long or short, nearer to the\r\n     source of celestial light. Consequently, I offer you no\r\n     instructions and put no fetters on your imagination.\"\r\n\r\nIt takes all sorts of art to make an artistic world, as it takes all\r\nsorts of people to make the human world: a world with only classic art\r\nin it would be as uninteresting and unthinkable as a world in which\r\nevery one was of the same character, occupation, and dress.\r\n\r\nBut it is time to consider the Emperor a little more in detail in\r\nrelation to his connexion with the arts. If he were not a first-rate\r\nmonarch he would probably be a first-rate artist. He said once that if\r\nhe were to be an artist, he would be a sculptor. But if he is not a\r\nprofessional artist he is a connoisseur, a dilettante in the right\r\nsense, a lover of the arts, an art-loving prince. The painter Salzmann\r\ntells us how he used to go to the Villa Liegnitz in Potsdam to give\r\nPrince William lessons, and how the Empress, then Princess William,\r\nused to sit with the pupil and his teacher, discussing technical and\r\nart questions. A result of the teaching, in addition to the pictures\r\nmentioned elsewhere, was an oil-painting, a sea-fight, which still\r\nhangs in the Ravene Gallery in Berlin.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1886 the Prince sent his teacher a sketch for\r\ncriticism. Salzmann wired his opinion to Potsdam, and a telegram came\r\nback, \"What does 'wind too anxious' mean? is it so stormily painted\r\nthat you shuddered at it, or is it not stormy enough?\" Salzmann is\r\nalso authority for the statement that the Prince sent in a sea-piece\r\nto the annual Berlin Art Exhibition. It was placed ready to be judged,\r\nbut suddenly disappeared. The Emperor William, it appeared, had\r\ndecided that it would not do for a future Emperor to compete with\r\nprofessional artists or run the risk of sarcastic public criticism.\r\nNaturally since he came to the throne the Emperor has never had time\r\nto cultivate his talent as a painter, but has always fed his eyes and\r\nmind on the best kind of painting, and brings his sense of form and\r\ncolour to bear on everything he does or has a voice in.\r\n\r\nThat the Emperor's own taste in painting is of a \"classical\" kind in a\r\nvery catholic sense was shown by the personal interest he took in\r\ngetting together and having brought to Berlin the exhibition of old\r\nEnglish masters in 1908. At his request the English owners of many of\r\nthese treasures agreed to lend them for exhibition in Germany,\r\nsubmitting thereby to the risk of loss or damage, displaying an\r\nunselfish disposition to aid in elevating the taste of a foreign\r\npeople, and at the same time giving Germans a better and more tangible\r\nidea of the nation which could produce artists of such nobility of\r\nfeeling and marvellous technical capacity. The Emperor paid several\r\nvisits to the exhibition and thousands of Berlin folk followed his\r\nexample, so that the beauty of the works of Gainsborough, Raeburn,\r\nLawrence, Hoppner, and Romney was for months a topic of enthusiastic\r\nconversation in the capital.\r\n\r\nEncouraged by this success, the Emperor next caused a similar\r\nexhibition of French painters to be arranged. The Rococo period was\r\nnow chosen, many lovely specimens of the art of Watteau, Lancret,\r\nDavid, Vigee, Lebrun, Fragonnard, Greuze, and Bonnat were procured,\r\nand again the Berliner was given an opportunity not only of enjoying\r\nan artistic treat of a delightful kind, but of comparing the\r\nimpressions made on him by the art spirits of two other nations. The\r\nopening of this French exhibition was made by the Emperor the occasion\r\nof emphasizing his conciliatory feelings towards France, for he\r\nattended an evening entertainment at the French Embassy given\r\nspecially in honour of the occasion.\r\n\r\nA third art exhibition followed in 1910--that of two hundred American\r\noil paintings brought to Berlin and shown in the Royal Academy of Arts\r\non the Panser Platz. They included works by Sargent, Whistler, Gari\r\nMelchior, Leon Dabo, Joseph Pennell, and many others. The suggestion\r\nfor this exhibition did not proceed from the Emperor, but in all\r\npossible ways he gave the exhibition his personal support. On\r\nreturning from inspecting it he telegraphed to the American Ambassador\r\nin Berlin, Dr. D. J. Hill, to express the pleasure he had derived from\r\nwhat he had seen. Nor was such a mark of admiration surprising. The\r\nexhibition was nothing short of a revelation, going far to dissipate\r\nthe German belief--perhaps the English belief also--that America\r\npossesses no body of painters of the first rank.\r\n\r\nAgain we have recourse to the marine painter, Herr Salzmann. Wired for\r\nby the Emperor, the painter got to the palace at 10.15 PM. When he\r\narrived the Emperor cried out, \"So, at last! Where have you been\r\nhiding yourself? I have had Berlin searched for you.\" The Emperor and\r\nEmpress and suite had just returned from the theatre and were standing\r\nabout the room. It turned out that the Emperor wanted the painter to\r\nhelp him sketch a battleship of a certain design he had in mind, to\r\nsee how it would look on the water. In the middle of the room an\r\nadjutant stood and read out a speech made by a Radical deputy in the\r\nReichstag that day, and the Emperor made occasional remarks about it,\r\nthough at the same time he was engaged with the ship. The painter does\r\nnot forget to add that he \"was provided with a good glass of beer.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is reported to be a capital \"sitter.\" He had the French\r\npainter Borchart staying with him at Potsdam to paint his portrait.\r\nBorchart describes him as an ideal model, so still and patiently did\r\nhe sit, and this at times for more than two hours. He talked freely\r\nduring the sittings. \"I don't want to be regarded as a devourer of\r\nFrenchmen,\" was a remark made on one of these occasions; on another he\r\npraised President Loubet; and on a third he had a good word even for\r\nthe Socialist Jaures. When Borchart had finished and naively expressed\r\nsatisfaction with his own work the Emperor said, \"Na, na, friend\r\nBorchart, not so proud; it is for us to criticize.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Emperor is a lover of the \"classical\" in painting and\r\nsculpture, it is not strange to find him an admirer of the classical\r\nin music and recommending it to his people as the best form of musical\r\neducation. He holds that there is much in common between it and the\r\nfolk-songs of Germany. At Court he revived classical dances like the\r\nminuet and the gavotte. He is devoted to opera and never leaves before\r\nthe end of the performance. Concerts frequently take place in the\r\nroyal palaces at Potsdam and Berlin, items on the programme for them\r\nbeing often suggested by the Emperor. The programme is then submitted\r\nto him and is rarely returned without alteration. Not seldom the\r\nconcert is preceded by a rehearsal, which the Emperor attends and\r\nwhich itself has been carefully rehearsed beforehand, as the Emperor\r\nexpects everything to run smoothly. At these rehearsals he will often\r\ncause an item to be repeated. Bach and Handel are his prime\r\nfavourites. He is no admirer of Strauss. Wagner he often listens to\r\nwith pleasure, and especially the \"Meistersinger,\" which is his pet\r\nopera. Of Italian operas Verdi's \"Aida\" and Meyerbeer's \"Huguenots\"\r\nare those he is most disposed to hear.\r\n\r\nHe has been laughed at for once attempting musical composition. The\r\n\"Song to Aegir,\" which he composed in 1894 at the age of thirty-five\r\n(when he should have known better), was, he told the bandmaster of a\r\nHannoverian regiment, suggested to him by the singing of a Hannoverian\r\nglee society. It is a song twenty-four lines long, with the inevitable\r\nreferences to the foe, and the sword and shield, and whales and\r\nmermaids, and the God of the waves, who is called on to quell the\r\nstorm. The lady-in-waiting who wrote the \"Private Lives of the Emperor\r\nand His Consort\" tells with much detail how the song was really\r\nwritten, not by the Emperor, but almost wholly by a musical adjutant.\r\nIt does not greatly matter, but it is likely that the Emperor is\r\nresponsible for the text if he did not compose the music.\r\n\r\nOne of the best and most interesting descriptions of his kindly and\r\ncharacteristic way of treating artists is that given by the late\r\nNorwegian composer, Eduard Grieg.\r\n\r\n\"The other day,\" writes the composer,\r\n\r\n     I had a chance to meet your Kaiser. He had already expressed\r\n     a desire last year to meet me, but I was ill at that time.\r\n     Now he has renewed his wish, and therefore I could not\r\n     decline the invitation. I am, as you know, little of a\r\n     courtier. But I said to myself, 'Remember Aalesund' (for\r\n     which the Emperor had sent a large sum after a great fire),\r\n     and my sense of duty conquered. Our first meeting was at\r\n     breakfast at the German Consul's house. During the meal we\r\n     spoke much about music. I like his ways, and--oddly\r\n     enough--our opinions also agreed. Afterwards he came to me\r\n     and I had the pleasure of talking with him alone for nearly\r\n     an hour. We spoke about everything in heaven and\r\n     earth--about poetry, painting, religion, Socialism, and the\r\n     Lord knows what besides.\r\n\r\n     \"He was fortunately a human being, and not an Emperor. I was\r\n     therefore permitted to express my opinions openly, though in\r\n     a discreet manner, of course. Then followed some music. He\r\n     had brought along an orchestra (!), about forty men. He took\r\n     two chairs, placed them in front of all the others, sat down\r\n     on one, and said, 'If you please, first parquet'; and then\r\n     the music began--Sigurd Jorsalfar, Peer Gynt, and many other\r\n     things.\r\n\r\n     \"While the music was being played he continually aided me in\r\n     correcting the _tempi_ and the expression, although as a\r\n     matter of course I had not wanted to do such a thing. He was\r\n     very insistent, however, that I should make my intentions\r\n     clear. Then he illustrated the impression made by the music\r\n     by movements of his head and body. It was wonderful\r\n     _(göttlich)_ to watch his serpentine movements _à la\r\n     Orientalin_ while they played Anitra's dance, which quite\r\n     electrified him.\r\n\r\n     \"Afterwards I had to play for him on the piano, and my wife,\r\n     who sat nearest him, told me that here too he illustrated\r\n     the impression made on him, especially at the best places.\r\n\r\n     \"I played the minuet from the pianoforte sonata which he\r\n     found 'very Germanic' and powerfully built: and the 'Wedding\r\n     Day at Troldhaugen,' which piece he also liked.\r\n\r\n     \"On the following day there was a repetition of these things\r\n     on board the _Hohenzollern_, where we were all invited to\r\n     dinner at eight o'clock. The orchestra played on deck in the\r\n     most wondrously bright summer night while many\r\n     hundreds--nay, I believe thousands--of rowboats and small\r\n     steamers were grouped about us. The crowd applauded\r\n     constantly and cheered enthusiastically whenever the Kaiser\r\n     became visible. He treated me like a patient: he gave me his\r\n     cloak and sent to fetch a rug, with which he covered me\r\n     carefully.\r\n\r\n     \"I must not forget to relate that he grew so enthusiastic\r\n     over 'Sigurd Jorsalfar,' the subject of which I explained to\r\n     him as minutely as possible, that he said to von Hiilsen,\r\n     the intendant of the royal theatres, who sat next to him:\r\n     'We must produce this work! (This was not done, however.)\r\n\r\n     \"I then invited von Hiilsen to come to Christiania to\r\n     witness a performance of it, and he said he was very eager\r\n     to so. All in all this meeting was an event and a surprise\r\n     in the best sense. The Kaiser, certainly, is a very uncommon\r\n     man, a strange mixture of great energy, great self-reliance,\r\n     and great kindness of heart. Of children and animals he\r\n     spoke often and with sympathy, which I regard as a\r\n     significant thing.\"\r\n\r\nOn the New Year's Day following the Emperor sent the composer a\r\ntelegram reading: \"To the northern bard to listen to whose strains has\r\nalways been a joy to me I send my most sincere wishes for the new year\r\nand new creative activity.\" In 1906, Grieg, having once more been the\r\nEmperor's guest, writes to a friend:\r\n\r\n     \"He was greatly pleased with having become once more a\r\n     grandfather. He called to me across the table (referring to\r\n     'Sigurd'), 'Is it agreeable if I call the child Sigurd?' It\r\n     must be something _Urgermanisch_.\"\r\n\r\nThe following anecdote may remind the reader of the amusing scene in\r\nOffenbach's \"Grand Duchesse of Gerolstein,\" where the Grand Duchess,\r\ntalking to the guardsman whose athletic proportions she admires,\r\naddresses him with a rising scale of \"corporal\" ... \"sergeant\" ...\r\n\"lieutenant\" ... \"captain\" ... \"colonel,\" and so on, as she talks,\r\nonly, however, later cruelly to re-descend the scale to the very\r\nbottom when her courtship is ineffectual. The Emperor is at an organ\r\nrecital in the Kaiser William Memorial Church; the recital is over and\r\nthe Court party are about to go when he greets the organist, Herr\r\nFischer: \"My cordial thanks for the great pleasure you have given us,\r\nHerr Professor.\" \"Pardon, your Majesty,\" replies the organist, with\r\ncommendable presence of mind: \"May I venture to thank your Majesty for\r\nthe great mark of favour?\" \"What mark of favour?\" asks the Emperor, a\r\nlittle puzzled. \"The fact is your Majesty has more than once addressed\r\nme as 'professor,' although--\" \"Why, that's good,\" exclaims the\r\nEmperor, with a great laugh, \"very good indeed;\" and striking his\r\nforehead in self-reproach with the palm of his hand: \"so forgetful of\r\nme! Then you are not professor, after all! Well, no matter; what is\r\nnot, may be--what I said, I said. Adieu, _Herr Professor_\" and goes\r\noff smiling. The very same evening--need it be added?--Herr Fischer\r\nhad his patent as Professor in his pocket.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is particularly fond of \"my Americans\" among his operatic\r\nartists. A good deal of jealousy has at times been shown by the German\r\nemployees of the opera towards the American artists entertained there\r\nand a deputy has more than once protested in the Reichstag against the\r\nnumber employed; but the jealousy rarely results in harm, and on the\r\nwhole harmony--as it should--prevails.\r\n\r\nEvery year brings hundreds of American girl students to Berlin,\r\nMunich, or Dresden to learn singing and perhaps carry off the great\r\nprize of a \"star\" engagement at one or the other of the German royal\r\nopera houses. The experiences of some of these students are tragedies\r\non a small scale, and in one or two instances have been known to end\r\nin death, destitution, or dishonour. The explanation is simple. Such\r\nstudents, filled with the high hopes inspired by artistic ambition and\r\nthe artist's imagination, fail to ask themselves before going abroad\r\nif nature has endowed them with the qualities and powers requisite for\r\none of the most laborious and, for a girl, exposed professions in the\r\nworld; and do not learn until it is too late that they lack the\r\nresolute character, the robust health, and the talent which, not\r\nsingly but all three combined, are essential to success.\r\n\r\nSuch a girl often starts on her enterprise poorly supplied with means\r\nto pay for her board, lodging, clothes, recreation, and instruction;\r\nshe changes from the dearer sort of _pension_ to the cheaper, finding\r\nher company and surroundings at each remove more doubtful and more\r\ndangerous; she grows disappointed and disheartened, perhaps physically\r\nill; comes under bad influences, male or female; until finally the\r\ncurtain falls on a sufferer rescued at the last moment by relatives or\r\nfriends, or on a young life blasted. Such tragic cases, it should be\r\nsaid, are far from common, but they occur, and the possibility of\r\ntheir occurrence ought to be taken into account at the outset by the\r\nintending music or art student.\r\n\r\nHappily there is another and brighter side to the picture, and the\r\nintending student with money and friends will enjoy and gain advantage\r\nfrom a few years of continental life, even though exceptional strength\r\nand genuine talent be wanting. Perhaps this is the experience of the\r\ngreat majority of art students in Germany. Freedom from the restraints\r\nand conventions of life at home compensates for the inconveniences\r\narising from narrow means. Novelty of scenery and surroundings has a\r\ncharm that is constantly recurring. The kindness and helpfulness of\r\nfellow-countrymen and countrywomen make the wheels of daily life roll\r\nsmoothly. The freemasonry of art, its optimism and hope, and the\r\npleasure and interest of its practice, investigation, and discussion\r\nwing the hours and spur to effort.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Emperor. As a lad at Cassel he was fond of\r\nplaying charades, and is reported to have had a knack of quickly\r\nsketching the scenario and _dramatis personæ_ of a play which he and\r\nhis young companions would then and there proceed to act. One of these\r\nplays had Charlemagne for its subject, with a Saxon feudatory, whose\r\nlovely daughter, Brunhilde, scorns her father for his submission. A\r\nbanquet, ending in a massacre of Charlemagne's followers, is one of\r\nthe scenes, and as Brunhilde is in love with Charlemagne's son she\r\nhelps him to escape from the massacre. The Play ends with the suicide\r\nof Brunhilde. As he grew up the Emperor's interest in the theatre\r\nincreased, and, as has been seen, when he succeeded to the throne he\r\nresolved to make use of it for educating and elevating the public\r\nmind. As patriotism consists largely in knowing and properly\r\nappreciating history he has always encouraged dramatists who could\r\nportray historic scenes and events, particularly those with which the\r\nHohenzollerns were connected. Hence his support of Josef Lauff, Ernst\r\nvon Wildenbruch and Detlev von Liliencron. Not long ago he arranged a\r\nseries of performances at Kroll's Theatre intended for workmen only.\r\nThe performances were chiefly of the stirring historical\r\nkind--Schiller's \"Wilhelm Tell,\" Goethe's \"Götz von Berlichingen,\"\r\nKleist's \"Prince von Hornburg,\" and others that require huge\r\nprocessions and a crowded stage. The general public were not supposed\r\nto attend the performances, but tickets were sent to the factories and\r\nworkshops for sale at a low price.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the Emperor publicly stated his views about the theatre. \"When\r\nI mounted the throne ten years ago,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"I was, owing to my paternal education, the most fervent of\r\n     idealists. Convinced that the first duty of the royal\r\n     theatres was to maintain in the nation the cultivation of\r\n     the idealism to which, God be thanked, our people are still\r\n     faithful, and of which the sources are not yet nearly\r\n     exhausted, I determined to myself to make my royal theatres\r\n     an instrument comparable to the school or the university\r\n     whose mission it is to form the rising generation and to\r\n     inculcate in them respect for the highest moral traditions\r\n     of our dear German land. For the theatre ought to contribute\r\n     to the culture of the soul and of the character, and to the\r\n     elevation of morals. Yes, the theatre is also one of my\r\n     weapons.... It is the duty of a monarch to occupy himself\r\n     with the theatre, because it may become in his hands an\r\n     incalculable force.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Emperor has any special gift it is an eye for theatrical effect\r\nin real life as well as on the stage. He had a good share of the\r\nactor's temperament in his younger years, and until recently showed it\r\nin the conduct of imperial and royal business of all kinds. He still\r\ngives it play occasionally in the royal opera houses and theatres. The\r\nEnglishman, whose ruler is a civilian, is not much impressed by\r\npageantry and pomp, except as reminding him of superannuated, though\r\nstill revered, historical traditions and events that are landmarks in\r\na great military and maritime past. He would not care to see his King\r\nalways, or even frequently, in uniform, as he would be apt to find in\r\nthe fact an undue preference for one class of citizens to another. His\r\nidea is that the monarch ought to treat all classes of his subjects\r\nwith equal kingly favour. In Germany it is otherwise. The monarchy\r\nrelies on military force for its dynastic security, as much, one might\r\nperhaps say, as for the defence of the country or the keeping of the\r\npublic peace, and consequently favours the military. Moreover, the\r\npeoples that compose the Empire have been harassed throughout the long\r\ncourse of their history by wars; a large percentage of their youth are\r\nserving in the standing army or in the reserves, the Landwehr and the\r\nLandsturm; finally the Germans, though not, as it appears to the\r\nforeigner, an artistic people, save in regard to music, enjoy the\r\nspectacular and the theatrical.\r\n\r\nAccordingly we find the Emperor artistically arranging everything and\r\nsucceeding particularly well in anything of an historical and\r\nespecially of a military nature. The spring and autumn parades of the\r\nBerlin garrison on the Tempelhofer Field--an area large enough, it is\r\nsaid, to hold the massed armies of Europe--with their gatherings of\r\nfrom 30,000 to 60,000 troops of all arms, serve at once to excite the\r\nBerliner's martial enthusiasm, while at the same time it obscurely\r\nreminds him that if he treats the dynasty disrespectfully he will have\r\na formidable repressive force to reckon with. Hence at manoeuvres the\r\nEmperor is accompanied by an enormous suite; whenever he motors down\r\nUnter den Linden it is at a quick pace, which impresses the crowd\r\nwhile it lessens the chances of the bomb-thrower or the assassin. The\r\nscene of the reception of Prince Chun at the New Palace was a great\r\nsuccess as an artistic performance, and the pageants at the\r\nrestoration of the Hohkönigsburg and at the Saalburg festival were of\r\nthe same artistic order.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's theatrical interest and attention when in Berlin are\r\nconcentrated on the Berlin Royal Opera and the Berlin Royal Theatre\r\n(Schauspielhaus), and when in Wiesbaden on the Royal Festspielhaus at\r\nthat resort. When in his capital he goes very rarely to any other\r\nplace of theatrical entertainment. His interest in the royal opera and\r\ntheatre both in Berlin and Wiesbaden is personal and untiring, and he\r\nhas done almost as much or more for the adequate representation of\r\ngrand opera in his capital as the now aged Duke of Saxe-Meiningen did,\r\nthrough his famous Meiningen players, for the proper presentation of\r\ndrama in Germany generally. The revivals of \"Aida\" and \"Les Huguenots\"\r\nunder the Emperor's own supervision are accepted as faultless examples\r\nof historical accuracy in every detail and of good taste and harmony\r\nin setting.\r\n\r\nIn a well-informed article in the _Contemporary Review_ Mr. G.\r\nValentine Williams writes:\r\n\r\n     \"Once the rehearsals of a play in which the Emperor is\r\n     interested are under way he loses no time in going to the\r\n     theatre to see whether the instructions he has appended to\r\n     the stage directions in the MS. are being properly carried\r\n     out. Some morning, when the vast stage of the opera is\r\n     humming with activity, the well-known primrose-coloured\r\n     automobile will drive up to the entrance and the Emperor,\r\n     accompanied only by a single adjutant, will emerge. In three\r\n     minutes William II will be seated at a big, business-like\r\n     table placed in the stalls, before him a pile of paper and\r\n     an array of pencils. When he is in the house there is no\r\n     doubt whatever in anyone's mind as to who is conducting the\r\n     rehearsal. His intendant stands at his side in the darkened\r\n     auditorium and conveys his Majesty's instructions to the\r\n     stage, for the Emperor never interrupts the actors himself.\r\n     He makes a sign to the intendant, scribbles a note on a\r\n     sheet of paper, while the intendant, who is a pattern of\r\n     unruffled serenity, just raises his hand and the performance\r\n     abruptly ceases. There is a confabulation, the Emperor, with\r\n     the wealth of gesture for which he is known, explaining his\r\n     views as to the positions of the principals, the dresses,\r\n     the uniforms, using anything, pencil, penholder, or even his\r\n     sword to illustrate his meaning. Again and again up to a\r\n     dozen times the actors will be put through their paces until\r\n     the imperial Regisseur is entirely satisfied that the right\r\n     dramatic effect has been obtained.\r\n\r\n     \"All who have witnessed the imperial stage-manager at work\r\n     agree that he has a remarkable _flair_ for the dramatic.\r\n     Very often one of his suggestions about the entrances or\r\n     exits, a piece of 'business' or a pose, will be found on\r\n     trial to enhance the effect of the scene. A story is told of\r\n     the Emperor's insistence on accuracy and the minute\r\n     attention he pays to detail at rehearsal. After his visit to\r\n     Ofen-Pest some years ago for the Jubilee celebration, which\r\n     had included a number of Hungarian national dances, the\r\n     Emperor stopped a rehearsal of the ballet at the Berlin\r\n     opera while a Czardas was in progress and pointed out to the\r\n     balletteuses certain minor details which were not correct.\r\n\r\n     \"In his attitude to the Court actors and actresses he\r\n     displays the charm of manner which bewitches all with whom\r\n     he comes in contact. He calls them 'meine Schauspieler,'\r\n     which makes one think of 'His Majesty's Servants' of\r\n     Shakespeare's Globe Theatre. This practice sometimes has\r\n     amusing results. Once when the Theatre Royal comedian, Dr.\r\n     Max Pohl, was suddenly taken ill the Emperor said to an\r\n     acquaintance, 'Fancy, my Pohl had a seizure yesterday;' and\r\n     the acquaintance, thinking he was referring to a pet dog\r\n     replied, commiseratingly: 'Ah, poor brute!' After rehearsal\r\n     the Emperor often goes on to the stage and talks with the\r\n     actors about their parts.\r\n\r\n     \"A Hohenzollern must not be shown on the stage without the\r\n     express permission of the Emperor, and in general, if\r\n     politics are mixed up in an objectionable way with the\r\n     action of the drama, the play will be forbidden. Above all\r\n     the Emperor will not tolerate indecency, nor the mere\r\n     suggestion of it, in the plays given at the royal theatres.\r\n     An anecdote about Herr Josef Lauff's Court drama 'Frederick\r\n     of the Iron Tooth,' dealing with an ancestor, an Elector of\r\n     Brandenburg, and on which Leoncavallo, at the Emperor's\r\n     request, wrote the opera 'Der Roland von Berlin,' shows the\r\n     Emperor's strictness in this respect. Frederick of the Iron\r\n     Tooth is a burgher of Berlin who leads a revolt against the\r\n     Elector. In order to heighten Frederick's hate, Lauff wove\r\n     in a love theme into the drama. The wife of Ryke,\r\n     burgomaster of Berlin, figured as Frederick's mistress and\r\n     egged on her lover against the Elector, because the latter\r\n     had hanged her brothers, the Quitzows, notorious outlaws of\r\n     the Mark Brandenburg. The Emperor cut out the whole episode\r\n     when the play was submitted to him in manuscript. The\r\n     marginal note in his big, bold handwriting ran: '_Eine\r\n     Courtisane kommt in einem Hohenzollerstück nicht vor_' (A\r\n     courtesan has no place in a Hohenzollern drama).\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's constant change of uniform is often said to be a sign of\r\nhis liking for the theatrical, and writers have compared him on this\r\naccount with lightning-change artists like the great Fregoli. Rather\r\nhis respect for and reliance on the army, a sense of fitness with the\r\noccasion to be celebrated, a feeling of personal courtesy to the\r\nperson to be received, are the motives for such changes. The Paris\r\n_Temps_ published the following incident apropos of the Emperor's\r\nvisit to England in November, 1902. When, on arriving at Port\r\nVictoria, the royal yacht _Hohenzollern_ came in view, the members of\r\nthe English Court sent to welcome the Emperor saw him through their\r\nglasses walking up and down the captain's bridge wearing a long\r\ncavalry cloak over a German military uniform. When they stepped on\r\nboard they found him in the undress uniform of an English admiral.\r\nThey lunched with him, and in the afternoon, when he left for London,\r\nhe was wearing the uniform of an English colonel of dragoons. Arrived\r\nin London, he left for Sandringham, and must have changed his dress\r\n_en route_, for he left the train in a frock-coat and tall hat.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most notable theatrical event of the reign hitherto was\r\nthe production at the Royal Opera in 1908 of the historic pantomime\r\n\"Sardanapalus.\" The Emperor's idea, as he said himself, was to \"make\r\nthe Museums speak,\" to which a Berlin critic replied, \"You can't\r\ndramatize a museum.\" The ballet, for it was that as well as a\r\npantomime, engrossed the Emperor's time and attention for several\r\nweeks. He spent hours with the great authority on Assyriology,\r\nProfessor Friedrich Delitzsch, going over reliefs and plans taken from\r\nthe Kaiser Friedrich Museum or borrowed from museums in Paris, London,\r\nand Vienna, decided on the costumes and designed the war-chariots to\r\nbe used in the ballet. The notion was to rehabilitate the reputation\r\nof Asurbanipal, the second-last King of Assyria, whom the Greeks\r\ncalled \"Sardanapalus,\" who reigned in Nineveh six hundred years before\r\nChrist, over Ethiopia, Babylon and Egypt, and whom Lord Byron,\r\naccepting the Greek story, represented as the most effeminate and\r\ndebauched monarch the world had ever known.\r\n\r\nProfessor Delitzsch, with a wealth of recondite learning, showed, on\r\nthe contrary, that Sardanapalus was a wise and liberal-minded monarch,\r\nwho, rather than fall into the hands of the Medes, built himself a\r\npyre in a chamber of his palace and perished on it with his wives, his\r\nchildren, and his treasure. The whole four acts, with the various\r\nballets, gave a perfectly faithful representation of the period as\r\ndescribed by Diodorus and Herodotus, and as plastically shown on the\r\nreliefs discovered at Nineveh by Sir Henry Layard and subsequently by\r\nGerman excavators. Over £10,000 was spent upon the production, and the\r\npublic were worked up to a great pitch of curiosity concerning it. But\r\nit was a complete failure as far as the public were concerned.\r\n\"Heavens!\" exclaimed one critic, \"what a bore!\" This, however, was not\r\nthe fault of the Emperor, but was due to want of interest on the part\r\nof a public whose enthusiasm for the events and characters of times so\r\nremote could only be kindled by a genius, and a dramatic one. The\r\nEmperor is no such genius, nor had he one at command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW CENTURY (_continued_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1902-1904\r\n\r\nKing George V has hardly been sufficiently long on the English throne\r\nfor a contemporary to judge of the personal relations that exist\r\nbetween his Majesty and the Emperor as chief representatives of their\r\nrespective nations. The King of England was, until June, 1913,\r\nhindered by various circumstances from paying a visit to the Court of\r\nBerlin, and rumours were current that relations between the two rulers\r\nwere not as friendly as they might and should be. There is now every\r\nindication that though the relations of people to people and\r\nGovernment to Government vary in degrees of coolness or warmth, the\r\ntwo monarchs are on perfectly good terms of cousinship and amity.\r\n\r\nA visit paid by King George, when Prince of Wales, to the Emperor in\r\nPotsdam at the opening of 1902 testified to the goodwill that then\r\nsubsisted between them. It was the evening before the Emperor's\r\nbirthday, when the Emperor, at a dinner given by the officers of King\r\nEdward's German regiment, the 1st Dragoon Guards, addressed the\r\nEnglish Heir Apparent in words of hearty welcome. The address was not\r\na long one, but in it the Emperor characteristically seized on the\r\nmotto of the Prince of Wales, \"_Ich dien_\" (I serve), to make it the\r\ntext of a laudatory reference to his young guest's conduct and career.\r\nIn its course the Emperor touched on the Prince's tour of forty\r\nthousand miles round the world, and the effect his \"winning\r\npersonality\" had had in bringing together loyal British subjects\r\neverywhere, and helping to consolidate the _Imperium Britannicum_, \"on\r\nthe territories of which,\" as the Emperor said, doubtless with an\r\nimperial pang of envy, \"the sun never sets.\" The Prince, in his reply,\r\ntendered his birthday congratulations, and expressed his \"respect\" for\r\nthe Emperor, the appropriate word to use, considering the ages and\r\nroyal ranks of the Emperor and his younger first cousin.\r\n\r\nWith 1902 may be said to have begun the Emperor's courtship (as it is\r\noften called in Germany) of America. His advances to the Dollar\r\nPrincess since then have been unremitting and on the whole cordially,\r\nif somewhat coyly, received.\r\n\r\nThe growth of intercourse of all kinds between Germany and the United\r\nStates is indeed one of the features of the reign. There are several\r\nreasons why it is natural that friendly relationship should exist. It\r\nhas been said on good authority that thirty millions of American\r\ncitizens have German blood in their veins. Frederick the Great was the\r\nfirst European monarch to recognize the independence of America.\r\nGerman men of learning go to school in America, and American men of\r\nlearning go to school in Germany. A large proportion of the professors\r\nin American universities have studied at German universities. The two\r\ncountries are thousands of miles apart, and are therefore less exposed\r\nto causes of international jealousy and quarrel between contiguous\r\nnations. On the other hand, the new place America has taken in the Old\r\nWorld, dating, it may be said roughly, from the time of her war with\r\nSpain (1898); the increase of her influence in the world, mainly\r\nthrough the efforts of brave, benevolent, and able statesmen; the\r\nexpansion of her trade and commerce; the increase of the European\r\ntourist traffic;--these factors also to some extent account for the\r\ngrowth of friendly intercourse between the peoples.\r\n\r\nNor should the bond between the two countries created by intermarriage\r\nbe overlooked. If the well-dowered republican maid is often ambitious\r\nof union with a scion of the old European nobility, the usually needy\r\nGerman aristocrat is at least equally desirous of mating with an\r\nAmerican heiress notwithstanding the vast differences in\r\nrace-character, political sentiment, manners, and views of life--and\r\nespecially of the status and privileges of woman--that must\r\nfundamentally separate the parties. Great unhappiness is frequently\r\nthe result of such marriages, perhaps it may be said of a large\r\nproportion of international marriages, but cases of great mutual\r\nhappiness are also numerous, and help to bring the countries into\r\nsympathy and understanding. Prince Bülow, when Chancellor, reminded\r\nthe Reichstag, which was discussing an objection raised to the late\r\nFreiherr Speck von Sternburg, when German Ambassador to America, that\r\nhe had married an American lady, that though Bismarck had laid down\r\nthe rule that German diplomatists ought not to marry foreigners, he\r\nwas quite ready to make exceptions in special cases, and that America\r\nwas one of them. The Emperor is well known to have no objection to his\r\ndiplomatic representative at Washington being married to an American,\r\nbut rather to prefer it, provided, of course, that the lady has plenty\r\nof money.\r\n\r\nA difficulty between Germany and Venezuela arose in 1902 owing to the\r\nill-treatment suffered by German merchants in Venezuela in the course\r\nof the civil war in that country from 1898 to 1900.\r\n\r\nThe merchants complained that loans had been exacted from them by\r\nPresident Castro and his Government, and that munitions of war and\r\ncattle had been taken for the use of the army and left unpaid for. The\r\namount of the claim was 1,700,000 Bolivars (francs), a sum that\r\nincluded the damage suffered by the merchants' creditors in Germany.\r\nSimilar complaints were made by English and Italian merchants. After\r\nseveral efforts on the part of Germany to obtain redress had failed,\r\nnegotiations were broken off, the diplomatic representative of Germany\r\nwas recalled, and finally the combined fleets of England, Germany, and\r\nItaly established a blockade of the Venezuelan coast. The difficulty\r\nwas eventually referred to the Hague Court of Arbitration, which\r\nallowed the claims and directed payment of them on the security of the\r\nrevenues of the customs ports of La Guayra and Puerto Cabella.\r\n\r\nFor a time the action of the Powers caused discussion of the Monroe\r\ndoctrine on both sides of the Atlantic. On this side it was pointed\r\nout that American susceptibilities had been respected by the conduct\r\nof the Powers in not landing troops, while on the other side there\r\nwere not wanting voices to exclaim that the naval demonstration went\r\ntoo near being a breach of the hallowed creed--\"hands off\" the Western\r\nHemisphere. The Monroe doctrine, it may be recalled, was contained in\r\na message of President James Monroe, issued on February 2, 1823. It\r\nwas drawn up by John Quincey Adams, and declared that the United\r\nStates \"regarded not only every effort of the Holy Alliance to extend\r\nits system to the Western Hemisphere as dangerous to the peace and\r\nfreedom of the United States, but also every interference with the\r\nobject of subverting any independent American Government in the light\r\nof unfriendliness towards America\"; and it went on to declare that\r\n\"the Continents of America should no more be regarded as fields for\r\nEuropean colonization.\"\r\n\r\nThe day, of course, may come when the American claim to the control,\r\nif not physical possession, of half the earth will be questioned by\r\nthe Powers of Europe; but at present, as far as Germany is concerned,\r\nand notwithstanding the absurd idea that Germany plans the seizure one\r\nday of Brazil, the doctrine is of merely academic interest. For a few\r\ndays four years later it became the subject of lively discussion in\r\nGermany and America owing to the first American Roosevelt professor,\r\nProfessor Burgess, referring to it in his inaugural lecture before the\r\nEmperor and Empress as an \"antiquated theory.\" As soon, however, as it\r\nbecame apparent that Professor Burgess was giving utterance to a\r\npurely personal opinion, and was not in any sense the bearer of a\r\nmessage on the subject from the President, the discussion dropped.\r\n\r\nAnother American episode of the year was the visit of Prince Henry,\r\nthe Emperor's brother, to the United States. Prince Henry left for\r\nAmerica in February. The visit was in reality made in pursuance of the\r\nEmperor's world-policy of economic expansion, but there were not a few\r\npoliticians in England and America to assert that it was part of a\r\ndeep scheme of the Emperor's to counteract too warm a development of\r\nAnglo-American friendship. However that may be, the visit was a\r\nstriking one, even though it gave no great pleasure to Germans, who\r\ncould not see any particular reason for it, nor any prospect of it\r\nyielding Germany immediate tangible return for trouble and expense.\r\nPrince Henry, it is said, though the most genial and democratic of\r\nHohenzollerns, was a little taken back at the American freedom of\r\nmanners, the wringing of hands, the slapping on the back, and other\r\nrepublican demonstrations of friendship; but he cannot have shown\r\nanything of such a feeling, for he was fêted on all sides, and soon\r\ndeveloped into a popular hero.\r\n\r\nOne of the incidents of the visit, previously arranged, was the\r\nchristening of the Emperor's new American-built yacht, _Meteor III_,\r\nby Miss Alice Roosevelt, the President's daughter. On February 25th\r\nthe Emperor received a cablegram from Prince Henry: \"Fine boat,\r\nbaptized by the hand of Miss Alice Roosevelt, just launched amid\r\nbrilliant assembly. Hearty congratulations;\" and at the same time one\r\nfrom the President's daughter: \"To his Majesty the Kaiser,\r\nBerlin--_Meteor_ successfully launched. I congratulate you, thank you\r\nfor the kindness shown me, and send you my best wishes. Alice\r\nRoosevelt.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the visit the Emperor cabled to President Roosevelt his thanks\r\nand that of his people for the hospitable reception of his brother by\r\nall classes, adding:\r\n\r\n     \"My outstretched hand was grasped by you with a strong,\r\n     manly, and friendly grip. May Heaven bless the relations of\r\n     the two nations with peace and goodwill! My best compliments\r\n     and wishes to Alice Roosevelt.\"\r\n\r\nReference to this cordial electric correspondence may close with\r\nmention of a telegram sent in reply to a message from Mr. Melville\r\nStone, of the American Associated Press:\r\n\r\n     \"Accept my thanks for your message. I estimate the great and\r\n     sympathetic reception (it was a banquet) given to my dear\r\n     brother by the newspaper proprietors of the United States\r\n     very highly.\"\r\n\r\nPrince Henry returned to Germany on March 17th, a Doctor of Law of\r\nHarvard University.\r\n\r\nThere have been moments when people in America were influenced by\r\nother sentiments than those of entirely respectful admiration for the\r\nEmperor. It was with mixed feelings that the American public heard the\r\nnews of his telegraphed offer to President Roosevelt in May, 1902,\r\nwhen, as the telegram said, the Emperor was \"under the deep impression\r\nmade by the brilliant and cordial reception\" given to his brother,\r\nPrince Henry, to present to the American nation a statue of--Frederick\r\nthe Great, and coupled with the offer a proposal that the statue\r\nshould be erected--of all places--in Washington! No one doubted the\r\nEmperor's sincere desire to pay the highest compliment he could think\r\nof to a people to whom he felt grateful for the honour done to Germany\r\nin the person of his brother, but nearly every one smiled at the\r\nsimplicity, or, as some called it, the want of political tact shown by\r\noffering the statue of a ruler whose name, to the vast majority of\r\nAmericans, is synonymous with absolute autocracy, to a republic which\r\nprides itself on its civic ways and love of personal freedom. The gift\r\nwas accepted by the American Government in the spirit in which it was\r\noffered, the spirit of goodwill. And why not? To the Emperor his great\r\nancestor's effigy is no symbol of autocracy, but the contrary, for to\r\nthe Emperor and his subjects Frederick the Great is as much the Father\r\nof Prussia, the man who saved it and made it, as Washington was the\r\nFather of America. Besides, the spirit in which a gift is offered, not\r\nits value or appropriateness, is the thing to be considered.\r\n\r\nIrritation in England was still strong against Germany on account of\r\nthe latter's easily understood race-sympathy with the Boers during the\r\nwar just over, but the fact did not prevent the Emperor from accepting\r\nKing Edward's invitation to spend a few days at Sandringham with him\r\nin November this year on the occasion of his birthday. The Emperor\r\ntook the Empress and two of his sons with him. The hostile temper of\r\nthe time, both in England and Germany, was alluded to in a sermon\r\npreached in Sandringham Church by the then Bishop of London. It was\r\nnotable for its insistence on the necessity of friendlier relations\r\nbetween England, Germany, and America, the three great branches of the\r\nTeutonic race. After the service the Emperor is reported to have\r\nexclaimed to the Bishop: \"What you said was excellent, and is\r\nprecisely what I try to make my people understand.\"\r\n\r\nAs a proof that this was no merely complimentary utterance, but the\r\nexpression of a thought which is constantly in the Emperor's mind, an\r\nincident which happened at Kiel regatta in the month of June\r\npreviously may be recalled. The American squadron, under the late\r\nAdmiral Cotton, was paying an official visit to the Emperor during the\r\nKiel \"week\" as a return honour for the visit of the Emperor's brother,\r\nPrince Henry of Prussia, to the United States the year before. There\r\nwas a constant round of festivities, and among them a lunch to the\r\nEmperor on board the Admiral's flagship, the _Kearsarge_. Lunch over,\r\nthe Emperor was standing in a group talking with his customary\r\nvivacity, but, as customary also, with his eyes taking in his\r\nsurroundings like a well-trained journalist. Suddenly he noticed a set\r\nof flags, those of America, Germany, and England, twined together and\r\nmingling their colours in friendly harmony. He walked over, gathered\r\nthe combined flags in his hand, and turning to the Admiral exclaimed\r\nin idiomatic American: \"See here, Admiral; that is exactly as it\r\nshould be, and is what I am trying for all the time.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in England the Emperor, in company with Lord Roberts and Sir\r\nEvelyn Wood, inspected his English regiment, the 1st Royal Dragoons. A\r\ncurious and amusing feature of the visit was a lecture before the\r\nRoyal Family at Sandringham by a German engineer, for whom the Emperor\r\nacted as interpreter, on a novel adaptation of spirit for culinary,\r\nlighting, and laundry purposes. The Emperor's practical illustration\r\nof the use of the new heating system, as applied to the ordinary\r\nhousehold flatiron, is said to have caused great merriment among his\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nGermany's home atmosphere about this time was for a moment troubled by\r\nan exhibition of the Emperor's \"personal regiment\" in the form of a\r\ntelegram to the Prince Regent of Bavaria, known in Germany as the\r\n\"Swinemunde Despatch.\" The Bavarian Diet, in a fit of economy, had\r\nrefused its annual grant of £5,000 for art purposes. The Emperor was\r\nviolently angry, wired to the Prince Regent his indignation with the\r\nDiet and offered to pay the £5,000 out of his own pocket. It was not a\r\nvery tactful offer, to be sure, though well intended; and as his\r\ntelegram was not an act of State, \"covered\" by the Chancellor's\r\nsignature, while the Bavarians in particular felt hurt at what they\r\nconsidered outside interference, Germans generally blamed it as a new\r\ndemonstration of autocratic rule.\r\n\r\nOne or two other art incidents of the period may be noted. A domestic\r\none was the gift to the Emperor by the Empress of a model of her hand\r\nin Carrara marble, life-sized, by the German sculptor, Rheinhold\r\nBegas. The Emperor, it is well known, has no special liking for the\r\ncompanionship of ladies, but he confesses to an admiration for pretty\r\nfeminine hands. Another incident was the Emperor's order to the\r\npainter, Professor Rochling, to paint a picture representing the\r\nfamous episode in the China campaign, when Admiral Seymour gave the\r\norder \"Germans to the Front.\" It is to the present day a popular\r\nGerman engraving. The year was also remarkable for a visit to Berlin\r\nof Coquelin _aîné_, the great French actor. The Emperor saw him in\r\n\"Cyrano de Bergerac,\" was, like all the rest of the play-going world,\r\ndelighted with both play and player, and held a long and lively\r\nconversation with the artist. Lastly may be mentioned a telegram of\r\nthe Emperor's to the once-famed tragic actress, Adelaide Ristori, in\r\nRome, congratulating her on her eightieth birthday and expressing his\r\nregret that he had never met her. A basket of flowers simultaneously\r\narrived from the German Embassy.\r\n\r\nWe are now in 1903. During the preceding years the Emperor's thoughts,\r\nas has been seen, were occupied with art as a means of educating his\r\nfolk, purifying their sentiments, and, above all, making them faithful\r\nlieges of the House of Hohenzollern. By a natural association of ideas\r\nwe find him this year thinking much and deeply about religion; for,\r\nthough artists are not a species remarkable for the depth or orthodoxy\r\nof their views on religious matters, art and religion are close\r\nallies, and probably the greater the artist the more real religion he\r\nwill be found to have.\r\n\r\nIn this year, accordingly, the Emperor made his remarkable confession\r\nof religious faith to his friend, Admiral Hollmann. He had just heard\r\na lecture by Professor Delitzsch on \"Babel und Bibel,\" and as he\r\nconsidered the Professor's views to some extent subversive of orthodox\r\nChristian belief, he took the opportunity to tell his people his own\r\nsentiments on the whole matter. In writing to Admiral Hollmann he\r\ninstructed him to make the \"confession\" as public as possible, and it\r\nwas published in the October number of the _Grenzboten_, a Saxon\r\nmonthly, sometimes used for official pronouncements. The Emperor's\r\nletter to Admiral Hollmann contained what follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I distinguish between two different sorts of Revelation: a\r\n     current, to a certain extent historical, and a purely\r\n     religious, which was meant to prepare the way for the\r\n     appearance of the Messiah. As to the first, I should say\r\n     that I have not the slightest doubt that God eternally\r\n     revealed Himself to the race of mankind He created. He\r\n     breathed into man His breath, that is a portion of Himself,\r\n     a soul. With fatherly love and interest He followed the\r\n     development of humanity; in order to lead and encourage it\r\n     further He 'revealed' Himself, now in the person of this,\r\n     now of that great wise man, priest or king, whether pagan,\r\n     Jew or Christian. Hammurabi was one of these, Moses,\r\n     Abraham, Homer, Charlemagne, Luther, Shakespeare, Goethe,\r\n     Kant, Kaiser William the Great--these He selected and\r\n     honoured with His Grace, to achieve for their peoples,\r\n     according to His will, things noble and imperishable. How\r\n     often has not my grandfather explicitly declared that he was\r\n     an instrument in the hand of the Lord! The works of great\r\n     souls are the gifts of God to the people, that they may be\r\n     able to build further on them as models, that they may be\r\n     able to feel further through the confusion of the\r\n     undiscovered here below. Doubtless God has 'revealed'\r\n     Himself to different peoples in different ways according to\r\n     their situation and the degree of their civilization. Then\r\n     just as we are overborne most by the greatness and might of\r\n     the lovely nature of the Creation when we regard it, and as\r\n     we look are astonished at the greatness of God there\r\n     displayed, even so can we of a surety thankfully and\r\n     admiringly recognize, by whatever truly great or noble thing\r\n     a man or a people does, the revelation of God. His influence\r\n     acts on us and among us directly.\r\n\r\n     \"The second sort of Revelation, the more religious sort, is\r\n     that which led up to the appearance of the Lord. From\r\n     Abraham onward it was introduced, slowly but foreseeingly,\r\n     all-wisely and all-knowingly, for otherwise humanity were\r\n     lost. And now commences the astonishing working of God's\r\n     Revelation. The race of Abraham and the peoples that sprang\r\n     from it regard, with an iron logic, as their holiest\r\n     possession, the belief in a God. They must worship and\r\n     cultivate Him. Broken up during the captivity in Egypt, the\r\n     separated parts were brought together again for the second\r\n     time by Moses, always striving to cling fast to monotheism.\r\n     It was the direct intervention of God that caused this\r\n     people to come to life again. And so it goes on through the\r\n     centuries till the Messiah, announced and foreshadowed by\r\n     the prophets and psalmists, at last appears, the greatest\r\n     Revelation of God to the world. Then he appeared in the Son\r\n     Himself; Christ is God; God in human form. He redeemed us,\r\n     He spurs us on, He allures us to follow Him, we feel His\r\n     fire burn in us, His sympathy strengthens us, His\r\n     displeasure annihilates us, but also His care saves us.\r\n     Confident of victory, building only on His word, we pass\r\n     through labour, scorn, suffering, misery and death, for in\r\n     His Word we have God's revealed Word, and He never lies.\r\n\r\n     \"That is my view of the matter. The Word is especially for\r\n     us evangelicals made the essential thing by Luther, and as\r\n     good theologian surely Delitzsch must not forget that our\r\n     great Luther taught us to sing and believe--'Thou shalt\r\n     suffer, let the Word stand.' To me it goes without saying\r\n     that the Old Testament contains a large number of fragments\r\n     of a purely human historical kind and not 'God's revealed\r\n     Word.' They are mere historical descriptions of events of\r\n     all sorts which occurred in the political, religious, moral,\r\n     and intellectual life of the people of Israel. For example,\r\n     the act of legislation on Sinai may be regarded as only\r\n     symbolically inspired by God, when Moses had recourse to the\r\n     revival of perhaps some old-time law (possibly the codex, an\r\n     offshoot of the codex of Hammurabi), to bring together and\r\n     to bind together institutions of His people which were\r\n     become shaky and incapable of resistance. Here the historian\r\n     can, from the spirit or the text, perhaps construct a\r\n     connexion with the Law of Hammurabi, the friend of Abraham,\r\n     and perhaps logically enough; but that would no way lessen\r\n     the importance of the fact that God suggested it to Moses\r\n     and in so far revealed Himself to the Israelite people.\r\n\r\n     \"Consequently it is my idea that for the future our good\r\n     Professor would do well to avoid treating of religion as\r\n     such, on the other hand continue to describe unmolested\r\n     everything that connects the religion, manners, and custom\r\n     of the Babylonians with the Old Testament. On the whole, I\r\n     make the following deductions:--\r\n\r\n     \"1. I believe in One God.\r\n\r\n     \"2. We humans need, in order to teach Him, a Form,\r\n     especially for our children.\r\n\r\n     \"3. This Form has been to the present time the Old Testament\r\n     in its existing tradition. This Form will certainly\r\n     decidedly alter considerably with the discovery of\r\n     inscriptions and excavations; there is nothing harmful in\r\n     that, it is even no harm if the nimbus of the Chosen People\r\n     loses much thereby. The kernel and substance remain always\r\n     the same--God, namely, and His work.\r\n\r\n     \"Never was religion a result of science, but a gushing out\r\n     of the heart and being of mankind, springing from its\r\n     intercourse with God.\"\r\n\r\nIt is anticipating by a few months, but part of a speech the Emperor\r\nmade in Potsdam at the confirmation of his two sons, August Wilhelm\r\nand Oscar--two Hohenzollerns as yet not distinguished for anything in\r\nparticular--may be quoted in this connexion. Naturally he began by\r\ncomparing his sons' spiritual situation with that of a soldier on the\r\nday he takes the oath of allegiance: they were _vorgemerkt_, that is,\r\npredestined as \"fighters for Christ.\" \"What is demanded of you,\" the\r\nimperial father went on, \"is that you shall be personalities. This is\r\nthe point which, in my opinion, is the most important for the\r\nChristian in daily life. For there can be no doubt that we can say of\r\nthe person of the Lord, that He is the most 'personal personality' who\r\nhas ever wandered among the sons of men.... You will read of many\r\ngreat men--savants, statesmen, kings and princes, of poets also: but\r\nnevertheless no word of man has ever been uttered worthy of comparison\r\nwith the words of Christ; and I say this to you so that you may be in\r\na position to bear it out when you are in the midst of life's turmoil\r\nand hear people discussing religion, especially the personality of\r\nChrist. No word of man has ever succeeded in making people of all\r\nraces and all people enthusiastic for the same cause, namely, to\r\nimitate Him, even to sacrifice their lives for Him. The wonder can\r\nonly be explained by assuming that what He said were the words of the\r\nliving God, which are the source of life, and continue to live\r\nthousands of years after the words of the wise have been forgotten.\r\nThat is my personal experience and it will be yours.\r\n\r\n\"The pivot and turning-point,\" he continued,\r\n\r\n     \"of our mortal life, especially of a life full of\r\n     responsibility and labour--that is clearer and clearer to me\r\n     every year I live--lies simply and solely in the attitude a\r\n     man adopts towards his Lord and Saviour;\"\r\n\r\nand he concludes by exhorting his sons to disregard what people may\r\nsay about the cult of Christ being irreconcilable with the tasks and\r\nresponsibilities of \"modern\" life, but simply to do their best,\r\nwhatever their occupation, to become a personality after Christ's\r\nexample.\r\n\r\nThis is a sound and just statement of Christian faith, and it is\r\nquoted here to justify the view that the Emperor's soldiers and his\r\nDreadnoughts, his mailed fist and shining armour, are built and put on\r\nin the spirit of precaution and defence. The attitude, it cannot of\r\ncourse be denied, is based on the un-Christlike assumption that all\r\nmen (and particularly all peoples and their governments and\r\ndiplomatists) are liars; but in his favour it may be urged that for\r\nthat saying the Emperor could cite Biblical authority. And yet there\r\nis an inconsistency; for the saying is that of one of those same wise\r\nmen whose words, the Emperor admits, are transitory and mortal.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that the Emperor had a presentiment of some kind that\r\nhis life was now in danger, and that the presentiment may have attuned\r\nhis thoughts to meditation on Christ's life and teaching; for it is a\r\nfact, well worthy of remark, that in the fear of death man's one and\r\nonly relief and consolation is the knowledge that there was, and is, a\r\nmediator for him with his Creator. The address at his sons'\r\nconfirmation was delivered on October 17th, and on Sunday morning,\r\nNovember 8th all the world, it is hardly too much to say, was\r\nastonished and pained to learn, by a publication in the _Official\r\nGazette_, that the Emperor the day before had had to submit to a\r\nserious operation on his throat. The announcement spoke of a polypus,\r\nor fungoid growth, which had had to be removed; but all over the world\r\nthe conclusion was come to that the mortal affliction of the father\r\nhad fallen on the son and that the Emperor was a doomed man. Most\r\nprovidentially and happily it was nothing of the sort. On the 9th the\r\nEmperor was out of bed and signing official papers, on the 15th he was\r\nallowed to talk in whispers, and on the 17th it was declared by the\r\nphysicians that all danger was over and that no more bulletins would\r\nbe issued. On December 14th the Emperor received a congratulatory\r\nvisit from the President of the Reichstag, who reported to Parliament\r\nhis impression that \"the Emperor had completely recovered his old\r\nvigour (great applause) and that his voice was again clear and\r\nstrong.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had passed through what one may suppose to have been the\r\ndarkest hour of his life. He was naturally in high spirits, and a few\r\ndays after went to Hannover, where he made a martial speech in which\r\nhe toasted the German Legion for having \"by its unforgettable heroism,\r\nin conjunction with Blücher and his Prussians, saved the English army\r\nfrom destruction at Waterloo,\" a view, of course, which to an\r\nEnglishman has all the charm of novelty.\r\n\r\nOne or two further memorable incidents of 1903 may be recorded.\r\nTheodore Mommsen, the now aged historian of Rome, the greatest scholar\r\nof his time, died in November. He was in his day a Liberal\r\nparliamentarian of no mean ability; but for such men there is no\r\ncareer in Germany. However, as it turned out, the German people's loss\r\nproved to be all the world's gain. A son of the historian now\r\nrepresents a district of Berlin in the Reichstag. Two years before the\r\nhistorian's death an exchange of telegrams in Latin took place between\r\nhim and the Emperor. The occasion was the Emperor's laying the\r\nfoundation-stone of a museum on the plateau where the old Roman\r\ncastle, known as the Saalburg, stands. The Emperor telegraphed:\r\n\r\n     \"Theodoro Mommseno, antiquitatum romanarum investigatori\r\n     incomparabili, praetorii Saalburgensis fundamenta jaciens\r\n     salutem dicit et gratias agit Guilelmus Germanorum\r\n     Imperator.\"\r\n\r\nTo which the historian, with a modesty equal to his courtesy, replied:\r\n\"Germanorum principi, tam majestate quam humanitate, gratias agit\r\nantiquarius Lietzelburgensis.\"\r\n\r\nMention may also be made of a very characteristic speech of the\r\nEmperor's this year at Cüstrin, where he was unveiling a monument to a\r\nfavourite Hohenzollern, the Great Elector. Cüstrin, it will be\r\nremembered, is the town where Frederick the Great, another of the\r\nEmperor's favourites, was imprisoned by an angry father, along with\r\nhis friend Lieutenant Katte, when Frederick was trying to escape the\r\nparental cruelty and violence.\r\n\r\nReferring to Frederick's declaration that he was the \"first servant of\r\nthe State,\" the Emperor said:--\r\n\r\n     \"He could only learn to be so by subordination, by\r\n     obedience, in a word by what we Prussians describe as\r\n     discipline. And this discipline must have its roots in the\r\n     King's house as in the house of the citizen, in the army as\r\n     among the people. Respect for authority, obedience to the\r\n     Crown, and obedience to parental and paternal\r\n     influence--that is the lesson the memories of to-day should\r\n     teach us. From these attributes spring those which we call\r\n     patriotism, namely the subordination of the individual ego,\r\n     of the individual subject, to the welfare of all. It is what\r\n     is particularly needed at the present time.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was, of course, thinking of the Social Democrats. Having\r\nfinished his speech, he went and for a while stood thoughtfully at the\r\nhistoric window of Cüstrin Castle, from which Frederick watched the\r\nexecution of his unfortunate companion, Katte.\r\n\r\nOnly the year 1904 separates us from the Emperor's Morocco adventure.\r\nThe economic ideas which have been referred to as the basis of German\r\nforeign policy were germinating in his mind, and the plans for at\r\nleast a partial realization of them were working in his head.\r\nAddressing the chief burgomaster of Karlsruhe in April, just a year\r\nbefore he started for Tangier, he spoke of Weltpolitik. \"You are\r\nright,\" he told the burgomaster,\r\n\r\n     \"in saying that the task of the German people is a hard\r\n     one.... I hope our peace will not be disturbed, and that the\r\n     events that are now happening will open our eyes, steel our\r\n     courage, and find us united, if it should be necessary for\r\n     us to intervene in world-policy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had, no doubt, specially in mind the birth of the\r\nAnglo-French Entente and the war between Russia and Japan, both events\r\nforming the dominant factors of the political situation at this time.\r\nThe Russo-Japanese War arose primarily from the unwillingness of\r\nRussia to evacuate Manchuria after the Boxer troubles in China. The\r\nincidents of the war are still fresh in public memory.\r\n\r\nIt need only be recalled here that Germany was neutral throughout the\r\nconflict, that both President Roosevelt and the Emperor offered their\r\nservices as mediators in its course, and that on the capture of Port\r\nArthur by Admiral Nogi, in January, 1905, the Emperor telegraphed his\r\nbestowal of the _Ordre pour le Mérile_ on General Stoessel, the\r\nRussian defender of Port Arthur, and on Admiral Nogi.\r\n\r\nIn the troubled history of Anglo-German relations is to be recorded\r\nthe presence, in June of this year, of King Edward VII at Kiel with a\r\nsquadron of battleships to pay an official visit to his nephew. The\r\ntwo fleets, those sunny days, formed a splendid spectacle--the two\r\nmightiest police forces, the Emperor would probably agree in saying,\r\nthe world could produce. In fact, the Emperor had some such thought in\r\nmind, for he addressed King Edward as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"Your Majesty has been welcomed by the thunder of the guns\r\n     of the German fleet. It is the youngest navy in the world\r\n     and an expression of the reviving sea-power of the new\r\n     German Empire, founded by the late great Emperor, designed\r\n     for the protection of the Empire's trade and territory, and\r\n     intended, equally with the German army, for the preservation\r\n     of peace.\"\r\n\r\nOne or two other incidents of interest in the Emperor's life may close\r\nthe record of this year. One of them was the arrival of the Italian\r\ncomposer, Leoncavallo, in Berlin, to hand the Emperor the text of the\r\nopera \"Der Roland von Berlin,\" Leoncavallo had composed at the\r\nEmperor's express request. Roland was a \"strong, valiant and pious\"\r\nknight of Charlemagne's time--like the Emperor, let us say--who\r\noriginally hailed from Brittany--that lone and lovely Cinderella of\r\nFrance--and afterwards, for some unexplained reason, came to be the\r\ntype of municipal independence in Germany.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the Emperor and the Empress made an excursion, when\r\non the Saalburg, to the statues of the Roman Emperors Hadrian and\r\nSeverus. Did the Emperor recall, one wonders, as he stood before the\r\nfigure of Hadrian, that pagan monarch's address to his soul:--\r\n\r\n     \"Animula vagula, blandula,\r\n     Hospes, comesque corporis,\r\n     Quae nunc abibis in loca,\r\n     Pallidula, rigida, nudula,\r\n     Nee, ut soles, dabis jocos?\"\r\n\r\nIt sounds a little gloomy as a quotation, but, fortunately for Germany\r\nand the Emperor, for \"nunc\" can be put, _pace_ the poet, the\r\nindefinite, yet all too definite, \"aliquando.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOROCCO\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1905\r\n\r\nThe Emperor started for Tangier towards the end of March, but before\r\nthat he had got through imperial business of a miscellaneous kind\r\nwhich exemplifies the life he leads practically at all times.\r\n\r\nIn January he had exchanged telegrams with the Czar and the Mikado\r\nconcerning his bestowal of the Order of Merit on Generals Stoessel and\r\nNogi, asking permission to bestow the Order and receiving expressions\r\nof consent. Another telegram went to the composer Leoncavallo in\r\nNaples, congratulating him on the success there of his \"Roland von\r\nBerlin.\" In February, the Emperor opened an international Automobile\r\nExhibition in Berlin, received Prince Charles, Infanta of Spain, and\r\nthe King of Bulgaria, unveiled a monument to his ancestor, Admiral\r\nColigny, who was killed in the Bartholomew massacre, listened to a\r\nnaval captain's lecture on Port Arthur, opened the new Lutheran\r\nCathedral (the \"Dom\") in Berlin, telegraphed thanks to the University\r\nof Pennsylvania for its doctor's degree which the Emperor said he was\r\nproud to know George Washington once held, attended a lecture by\r\nProfessor Delitzsch on \"Assyria,\" and was present at a memorial\r\nservice for the painter Adolf von Menzel, who died this month. In\r\nMarch he visited Heligoland, inspected the progress of some\r\nalterations at the Royal Opera in Berlin, and sent the Gold Medal for\r\nScience to Manuel Garcia, on the occasion of the latter's hundredth\r\nbirthday, as recognition of his invention of the laryngoscope, or\r\nmirror for examining the throat.\r\n\r\nJust before starting for Morocco the Emperor made the speech in which\r\nhe claimed that Germans are the \"salt of the earth.\" In the same\r\nspeech he had previously declared that as the result of his reading of\r\nhistory he meant never to strive after world-conquest. \"For what,\" he\r\nasked,\r\n\r\n     \"has become of the so-called world-empires? Alexander the\r\n     Great, Napoleon the First, all the great warrior heroes swam\r\n     in blood and left behind them subjugated peoples, who at the\r\n     first opportunity rose and brought their empires to ruin.\r\n     The world-empire which I dream of will be, above all, the\r\n     newly established German Empire, enjoying on every side the\r\n     most absolute confidence as a peaceable, honest, and quiet\r\n     neighbour, not founded on conquest by the sword, but on the\r\n     mutual confidence of nations, striving for the same\r\n     objects.\"\r\n\r\nWhile on the way to Morocco the Emperor put in at Lisbon to pay a\r\nvisit to the King of Portugal, and with the latter attended a meeting\r\nof the Geographical Society. From Lisbon he went to Gibraltar, and\r\nfrom thence, after a few hours' stay, he started for Tangier.\r\n\r\nThe Morocco incident, as it is often too lightly called, should rather\r\nbe regarded as a phase in the world's economic history and an\r\noccurrence of moment for the future peace of all nations than the mere\r\ngame on the diplomatic chess-board many writers appear to consider it.\r\nAccording to French critics, and they may be taken as representative\r\nof the feeling everywhere prevalent during the seven years the\r\nincident lasted, its origin was a matter of alliances and the balance\r\nof power. Germany, according to these writers, wanted to preserve the\r\nposition of hegemony in Europe she had obtained under Bismarck, and\r\nconsequently felt annoyed by the Triple Entente, which robbed her of\r\nher traditional friend Russia and set up an effective counterpoise to\r\nthe Triple Alliance of which Germany was the leading Power, and on\r\nwhich she could, or believed she could, rely for support in case of\r\nwar with France. In going, therefore, to Tangier, at the moment when\r\nher defeat by Japan rendered Russia for the time being of little or no\r\naccount in the considerations of diplomacy, the Emperor, according to\r\nthese writers, in reality was making a determined attempt to break the\r\nEntente combination and protect his Empire from political isolation or\r\ninferiority.\r\n\r\nIt is quite possible that such were the motives of the Emperor's\r\naction, but if so he was building better than he knew. The\r\nvicissitudes of the Moroccan episode are described briefly below, yet\r\nsome remarks of a general nature as to the whole episode considered in\r\nits historical perspective may be permitted in advance. But first,\r\nwhat is historical perspective? It may perhaps be defined as that view\r\nof history which shows in its true proportions the relative importance\r\nof an event to other events which strongly and permanently leave their\r\nmark on the character and development of the period or generation in\r\nwhich they occur. Regarded from this standpoint the Morocco incident\r\ncan claim an exceptional position, for it was the first occasion in\r\nmodern diplomatic history on which a Great Power officially proclaimed\r\n_urbi et orbi_ the doctrine of the \"open door,\" the doctrine of equal\r\neconomic treatment for all nations for the benefit of all nations, and\r\nwas willing to go to war in support of it.\r\n\r\nIt was not, of course, the first time the demand for the open door had\r\nbeen made; loudly and bloodily, too; since most wars from those of\r\nGreece and Rome to the war between Russia and Japan of recent years\r\nwere waged with the intention, or in the hope, of opening, by conquest\r\nor contract, territory of the enemy to the mercantile enterprise of\r\nthe victors. But this was the open door in a very selfish and\r\nrestricted sense, and though many isolated events had occurred of late\r\nyears, the international agreements regarding China among them,\r\nproving that the idea of the open door was gaining strength as a right\r\ncommon to all nations, it was not until the Emperor went to Tangier\r\nthat a Great Power risked a great war in order to exemplify and\r\nenforce it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and his advisers were probably not moved by any altruistic\r\nsentiments in the matter, and their sole reason for action may have\r\nbeen to see that German subjects should not be excluded from Moroccan\r\nmarkets. It may also be that Germany was resolved that if there was to\r\nbe a seizure of Morocco she should get her share of the territory to\r\nbe distributed, notwithstanding her refusal, revealed by the late\r\nForeign Secretary, Kiderlen-Waechter, in the Reichstag's confidential\r\ncommittee, to accede to Mr. Chamberlain's proposal, made some time\r\nbefore the incident, for a partition of the Shereefian Empire. But the\r\nacquisition of territory does not seem to have been the mainspring of\r\nher policy, while from the beginning to the end of the incident,\r\nhowever theatrical and questionable her diplomatic conduct may have\r\nbeen at moments during the negotiations, she was throughout consistent\r\nand successful in her demand for economic equality all round. This is\r\na great gain for the future, for, with the world nearly all parcelled\r\nout, economic considerations, which are almost in all cases\r\nadjustable, are now the most weighty factors in international\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\nApart from this view of the incident, it is clear that Germany was\r\npursuing her claim to a \"place in the sun,\" and she did so to the\r\nunconcealed annoyance of nations which up to then had never thought of\r\nher in a rôle she appeared to be aspiring to, that of a Mediterranean\r\nPower. To these nations she seemed an intruder in a sphere to which\r\nshe neither naturally nor rightfully belonged. Evidently she had no\r\npolitical or historical claims in Morocco, while her commercial\r\ninterests were less than 10 per cent of Morocco trade.\r\n\r\nA narration of the incident may, for the sake of convenience, though\r\ninvolving some anticipation of the future, be dealt with in three\r\nsections: from the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904, and the Emperor's\r\nvisit to Tangier in March, 1905, to the Act of Algeciras a year\r\nsubsequently; from the Act of Algeciras to the Franco-German Agreement\r\nof 1909; and from that to the--let it be hoped--final settlement by\r\nthe Franco-German Agreement of November 5, 1911.\r\n\r\nThe Anglo-French Agreement of 1904 gave France a free hand in Morocco\r\nin consideration of France giving England a similar position in Egypt\r\nand the Nile Valley. The state of things in Morocco at this time was\r\none of discord and rebellion. In the midst of it, the Sultan, El\r\nHassan, died, and was succeeded by Abdul Aziz, a minor. On coming of\r\nage Abdul Aziz showed his inability to rule, the country fell again\r\ninto disorder and Abdul turned for help to France. Meantime England\r\nand France had been negotiating without the knowledge of Germany, and\r\nin April, 1904, the Anglo-French Agreement was signed. It was\r\naccompanied by an official declaration that France had no intention of\r\nchanging the political status of Morocco, but only contemplated a\r\npolicy there of \"pacific penetration and reforms.\" Thereupon Prince\r\nvon Bülow, the German Chancellor, stated in the Reichstag that the\r\nGerman Government had no reason to assume that the Agreement was\r\ndirected against any Power and that \"it appeared to be an attempt by\r\nEngland and France to come to a friendly understanding respecting\r\ntheir colonial differences.\"\r\n\r\n\"From the standpoint of German interests,\" continued the Chancellor,\r\n\"we have no objections to raise to it.\" No parliamentary reference was\r\nmade to Morocco until March, 1905, when the Chancellor spoke of the\r\napproaching visit of the Emperor to Tangier, and it became evident\r\nthat the Emperor and his advisers had come to the conclusion that, as\r\nFrance seemed about assuming a full protectorate over Morocco, as she\r\nhad tried to do in Tunis, and that this, in accordance with French\r\npolicy, would result in the exclusion of other nationals from commerce\r\nand the development of the country, Germany must take action. Prince\r\nvon Bülow explained that \"his Majesty had, in the previous year,\r\ndeclared to the King of Spain that Germany pursued no policy of\r\nterritorial acquisition in Morocco.\" He continued:\r\n\r\n     \"Independent of the visit, and independent of the\r\n     territorial question, is the question whether we have\r\n     economic interests to protect in Morocco. That we have\r\n     certainly. We have in Morocco, as in China, a considerable\r\n     interest in the maintenance of the open door, that is the\r\n     equal treatment of all trading nations.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he concluded by saying:\r\n\r\n     \"So far as an attempt is being made to alter the\r\n     international status of Morocco, or to control the open door\r\n     in the economic development of the country, we must see more\r\n     closely than before that our economical interests are not\r\n     endangered. Our first step, accordingly, is to put ourselves\r\n     into communication with the Sultan.\"\r\n\r\nThe visit came off as announced, and the Emperor, on arriving at\r\nTangier, made a speech which caused a sensation in every diplomatic\r\nchancellery; indeed, in all parts of the world. The Emperor's speech,\r\nwhich was addressed to the German colonists on March 31, 1905, was as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I rejoice to make acquaintance with the pioneers of Germany\r\n     in Morocco and to be able to say to them that they have done\r\n     their duty. Germany has great commercial interests there. I\r\n     will promote and protect trade, which shows a gratifying\r\n     development, and make it my care to secure full equality\r\n     with all nations. This is only possible when the sovereignty\r\n     of the Sultan and the independence of the country are\r\n     preserved. Both are for Germany beyond question, and for\r\n     that I am ready at all times to answer. I think my visit to\r\n     Tangier announces this clearly and emphatically, and will\r\n     doubtless produce the conviction that whatever Germany\r\n     undertakes in Morocco will be negotiated exclusively with\r\n     the Sultan.\"\r\n\r\nThe result of these unmistakable declarations was that the Sultan\r\nrejected proposals made to him by the French, and shortly afterwards,\r\non the advice of Germany, came forward with suggestions for a European\r\nconference. M. Delcassé, the French Foreign Minister, opposed the\r\nproposal, and for a time war between France and Germany appeared\r\ninevitable; but France was not in a military position to ignore\r\nGermany's threatening language, M. Delcassé had to resign, the French\r\nCabinet under M. Rouvier agreed to the conference, and it met at\r\nAlgeciras in January, 1906. At the conference Great Britain, in\r\nconsonance with the Entente, supported France; Austria adhered loyally\r\nto her Triplice engagements and proved the \"brilliant second\" to\r\nGermany the Emperor subsequently described her; Italy, on the other\r\nhand, gave her Teutonic ally only lukewarm support.\r\n\r\nIn fairness, however, should be quoted here the explanation of Italy's\r\nattitude given by Chancellor von Bülow when discussing the conference\r\nin Parliament next year. The impression is general, both in and out of\r\nGermany, that Italy is only a half-hearted political ally. It is based\r\non the temperamental difference between the Latin and the Teutonic\r\nraces, on the popular sympathy between the French and Italian peoples,\r\nand to the supposedly reluctant support lent by Italy to Germany\r\nduring the critical time of the conference, the extra-tour, as Prince\r\nBülow, using a metaphor of the ballroom, termed it, she took with\r\nFrance on that occasion. Prince Bülow now endeavoured to dissipate or\r\ncorrect the impression, at any rate, as regarded Algeciras. \"Italy,\"\r\nhe said,\r\n\r\n     \"found herself in a difficult position there. Various\r\n     agreements between Italy and France regarding Morocco had\r\n     come into existence anterior to the conference, but Germany\r\n     was satisfied that they were not inconsistent with Italy's\r\n     Triplice engagements; in fact, Germany had, several years\r\n     ago, officially told Italy she must use her own judgment and\r\n     act on her own responsibility in dealing with her French\r\n     neighbour in Africa and the Mediterranean.\"\r\n\r\nWhen it was settled that a conference should be held, Italy, the\r\nChancellor continued, \"gave Germany timely information as to the\r\nextent to which her support of Germany could go, and as a matter of\r\nfact she supported Germany's views in the bank and police questions.\"\r\nSo far the German official explanation, but the impression of Italian\r\nlukewarmness as a member of the Triplice has lost none of its\r\nuniversality thereby. How well or ill founded the impression is, it\r\nwill be for the future to disclose.\r\n\r\nThe summoning of the conference had been a triumph for German\r\ndiplomacy, but its results were disappointing to her; for while the\r\nproceedings showed that among all nations she could only fully rely on\r\nthe sympathy and support of Austria, they ended in an acknowledgment\r\nby Germany of the special position of France in Morocco. The Act of\r\nAlgeciras, which was dated April 7, 1906, stated that the signatory\r\nPowers recognized that \"order, peace, and prosperity\" could only be\r\nmade to reign in Morocco\r\n\r\n     \"by means of the introduction of reforms based upon the\r\n     triple principle of the sovereignty and independence of his\r\n     Majesty the Sultan, the integrity of his States, and\r\n     economic liberty without any inequality.\"\r\n\r\nThen followed six Declarations regarding the organization of the\r\npolice, smuggling, the establishment of a State bank, the collection\r\nof taxes, and the finding of new sources of revenue, customs, and\r\nadministrative services and public works. For the organization of the\r\npolice, French and Spanish officers and non-commissioned officers were\r\nto be placed at the disposal of the Sultan by the French and Spanish\r\nGovernments. Tenders for public works were to be adjudicated on\r\nimpartially without regard to the nationality of the bidder. The\r\neffect of the Act was to give international recognition to the special\r\nposition of France and Spain in Morocco, while safeguarding the\r\neconomic interests of other Powers.\r\n\r\nThe attitude taken up by Germany relative to the conference was set\r\nforth in a speech delivered by Prince von Bülow in the Reichstag in\r\nDecember, 1905. It was based, he explained, on the provisions of the\r\nMadrid Convention of 1880, in which all the Great Powers and the\r\nUnited States had taken part. The Chancellor claimed that Germany\r\nsought no special privileges in Morocco, but favoured a peaceful and\r\nindependent development of the Shereefian Empire. He denied that\r\nGerman rights could be abrogated by an Anglo-French Agreement, and\r\npointing out that Morocco in 1880 had granted all the signatories to\r\nthe Madrid Convention most-favoured-nation treatment, claimed that if\r\nFrance desired to make good her demand for special privileges, she\r\nought to have the consent of the special signatories to the Madrid\r\npact. Germany had a right to be heard in any new settlement of\r\nMoroccan conditions; she could not allow herself to be treated as a\r\n_quantité négligeable_, nor be left out of account when a country\r\nlying on two of the world's greatest commercial highways was being\r\ndisposed of. She had a commercial treaty with Morocco, conferring\r\nmost-favoured-nation rights, and it did not accord with her honour to\r\ngive way.\r\n\r\nThe Act of Algeciras, however, proved to have brought only temporary\r\nrelief to European tension. Disturbances continued in Morocco, French\r\nsubjects were murdered at Marakesch in 1907, and France occupied the\r\nprovince of Udja with troops until satisfaction should be given. Owing\r\nto riots at Casablanca in 1908, in which French as well as Spanish and\r\nItalian labourers were killed, she decided to occupy the place, and\r\nsent a strong military and naval force thither. A French warship\r\nbombarded the town, and by June, 1908, the French army of occupation\r\nnumbered 15,000 men. Meanwhile internal commotions and intrigues had\r\nled to the deposition of Abdul Aziz and his replacement on the throne\r\nby his brother, Muley Hafid, with the support of Germany. France and\r\nSpain refused to recognize the new ruler unless he gave guarantees\r\nthat he would respect the Act of Algeciras. Muley gave the required\r\nguarantees, and in March, 1909, France \"declared herself wholly\r\nattached to the integrity and independence of the Shereefian Empire\r\nand decided to safeguard economic equality in Morocco.\" Germany on her\r\nside declared she was pursuing in Morocco only economic interests and,\r\n\"recognizing that the special political interests of France in Morocco\r\nare closely bound up in that country with the consolidation of order\r\nand of internal peace,\" was \"resolved not to impede those interests.\"\r\n\r\nThe German idea of not impeding French special political interests in\r\nMorocco was disclosed little more than two years later by the dispatch\r\nof the German gunboat _Panther_ (of \"Well done, _Panther_!\" fame) on\r\nJuly 3, 1911, to the \"closed\" port of Agadir on the south Moroccan\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nIt was as dramatic a coup as the Emperor's visit to Tangier and caused\r\nas much alarm. The fact is that the march of French troops to Fez,\r\nwhich had taken place a few months before, convinced the Emperor and\r\nhis Government that France, relying on the support of her Entente\r\nfriend England, was bent on the Tunisification of Morocco. The\r\nEmperor, Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, and Foreign Secretary\r\nKiderlen-Wæchter met at the Foreign Office on May 21st, and it was\r\ndecided to send a ship of war, as at once a hint and a demonstration,\r\nto Agadir or other Moroccan port. Germany, of course, in accordance\r\nwith diplomatic strategy, did not disclose the real springs of her\r\naction, though they must have been patent to all the world. She\r\nnotified the Powers of the dispatch of her warship, explaining that\r\nthe sending of the _Panther_, which \"happened to be in the\r\nneighbourhood,\" was owing to the representations of German firms, as a\r\ntemporary measure for the protection of German protégés in that\r\nregion, and taken \"in view of the possible spread of disorders\r\nprevailing in other parts of Morocco.\"\r\n\r\nIn France, on the other hand, it was asserted that the step was not in\r\nconformity with the spirit of the Franco-German Agreement of 1909, in\r\nwhich Germany resolved not to impede French special interests, that\r\nthere were no Germans at Agadir, and that only nine months previously\r\nGermany had angrily protested at the calling of a French cruiser at\r\nthe same port. The reference was to the visit of the French cruiser\r\n_Du Chaylu_ in November, 1910, when the captain paid a visit to the\r\nlocal pasha. The German Foreign Secretary eventually said Germany had\r\nno objection to France using her police rights even in a closed port,\r\nand the admission was taken as a fresh renunciation on the part of\r\nGermany of any right to interference. Feeling ran high for a time both\r\nin France and Germany, while the German action added to the sentiment\r\nof hostility to Germany in England, and English political circles\r\nperceived in it a design on Germany's part of acquiring a port on the\r\nMoroccan coast. The word \"compensation,\" which afterwards was to prove\r\nthe solution of Franco-German differences was now first mentioned by\r\nGermany.\r\n\r\nAfter England's determination to support France had been made plain by\r\nministerial statements, the entire Morocco episode was closed by the\r\nFranco-German Agreement signed on November 5, 1911, as \"explanatory\r\nand supplementary\" to the Franco-German Agreement of 1909. The effect\r\nof the new Agreement was practically to give France as free a hand in\r\nMorocco as England has in Egypt, with the reservation that \"the\r\nproceedings of France in Morocco leave untouched the economic equality\r\nof all nations.\" The Agreement further gives France \"entire freedom of\r\naction\" in Morocco, including measures of police. The rights and\r\nworking area of the Morocco State bank were left as they stood under\r\nthe Act of Algeciras. The sovereignty of the Sultan is assumed, but\r\nnot explicitly declared. The compensation to Germany for her agreement\r\nto \"put no hindrances in the way of French administration\" and for the\r\n\"protective rights\" she recognizes as \"belonging to France in the\r\nShereefian Empire\" was the cession by France to Germany of a large\r\nportion of her Congo territory in mid-Africa, with access to the Congo\r\nand its tributaries, the Sanga and Ubangi.\r\n\r\nWhile the ground-idea of Germany's policy of economic expansion, and\r\nthe source of all her trouble with England, is her insistence on her\r\n\"place in the sun,\" the difficulty attending it for other nations is\r\nto determine the place's nature and extent, so that every one shall be\r\ncomfortable and prosperous all round.\r\n\r\nThe alterations in conditions among civilized nations during the last\r\nhalf-century, more especially in all that relates to international\r\nintercourse--political, financial, commercial, social--makes it\r\nreasonable to suppose that changes must follow in the conduct of their\r\nforeign policies. The fact also, recognized by no country more clearly\r\nthan by Germany, that the profitable regions of the earth are already\r\nappropriated makes an economic policy for her all the more advisable.\r\nAn economic policy, moreover, is, notwithstanding her apparent\r\nmilitarism, most in harmony with the peaceful and industrious\r\ncharacter of her people. Unfortunately, the stage in progress where\r\nthe political and commercial interests of all nations have become\r\ndefined and adjusted has not yet been reached, though the numerous\r\nagreements between the Great Powers of recent years go far towards\r\nclearing the way for so desirable a consummation. Unfortunately, too,\r\nit is in the very process of finding bases for such agreements that\r\ninternational jealousies and misunderstandings arise; and hence in\r\nsecuring peace, governments and peoples are at all times nowadays most\r\nin jeopardy of war. This consideration alone might very well be used\r\nto justify nations in keeping their military and naval forces strong\r\nand ready. Perhaps some day such forms of force will not be wanted,\r\nthough admittedly the great majority of people still refuse to believe\r\nthat the changes which have occurred have altered the fundamental\r\nattitude of countries to each other, and remain firmly convinced that\r\nto-day, as yesterday and the day before, great nations are moved by an\r\nirresistible desire to add to their territories and in every way\r\naggrandize themselves, by diplomacy if possible, and if diplomacy\r\nfails, by force.\r\n\r\nIt is, of course, impossible to say with certainty what the real\r\ndesigns of the Emperor and his Government in this regard were during\r\nthe Morocco episode, or are now. Some believe that their designs have\r\nalways aimed, and still aim, at depriving Great Britain of her\r\nposition of superiority in respect of territory, maritime dominion,\r\nand trade. Others hold that they seek and will have, _coûte que\r\ncoûte_, new territory for Germany's increasing population, and look\r\nwith greedy eyes towards South America and even Holland. Others yet\r\nagain represent them as incessantly on the watch to seize a harbour\r\nhere or there as a coaling station for warships and a basis of attack.\r\nBut an unbiased survey of the annals of the Emperor's reign hitherto\r\ndoes not bear out any of these assertions. A policy of territorial\r\nexpansion as such, mere earth-hunger, cannot be proved against him.\r\nPrince Bismarck was no colonial enthusiast, though he passes for being\r\nthe founder of Germany's present colonial policy; and even to-day\r\nthe colonial party in Germany, though a very noisy, is not a very\r\nlarge or influential one. Samoa--East Africa--Kiao-tschau--the\r\nCarolines--Heligoland--the Cameroons: how can the acquisition of\r\ncomparatively insignificant and unprofitable places like these be used\r\nfor proving that the might of Germany is or has been directed towards\r\nterritorial conquest?\r\n\r\nWhat, it may however be asked, of the Morocco adventure? Of the speech\r\nat Tangier? Of the sending of the _Panther_ to Agadir? Of the demand\r\nfor compensation in Central Africa? Until the Morocco question arose,\r\nall the quarrels amongst the Powers regarding territory were caused by\r\nthe territorial ambition of France, or Russia, or Italy--not of\r\nGermany; and it was not until France showed openly, by sending her\r\ntroops to Fez, and thus ignoring the Act of Algeciras, that Germany\r\nput forward claims for territorial compensation in connection with\r\nMorocco. The visit of the Emperor to Tangier in 1905, a year after the\r\nAnglo-French Agreement, was doubtless an unpleasant surprise for both\r\nEngland and France. And not without good cause; for England and France\r\nare naturally and historically Mediterranean Powers--the one as\r\nguardian of the route to her Eastern possessions, the other as the\r\nowners of a large extent of Mediterranean coast; while England, in\r\naddition, was justified in seeing with uneasiness the possibility of a\r\nGerman settlement at Tangier or elsewhere on the Morocco seaboard. But\r\nthe Tangier visit and all that followed it was the consequence, not of\r\nan adventurous policy of territorial conquest, but of a legitimate,\r\nand not wholly selfish, desire for economic expansion.\r\n\r\nTaken, then, as a whole, the Emperor's foreign policy has been, as it\r\nis to-day, almost entirely economic and commercial. The same might, no\r\ndoubt, be said in a general way of all civilized Occidental\r\ngovernments, but there never has yet been a country of which the\r\nforeign policy was so completely directed by the economic and\r\nmercantile spirit as modern Germany. The foreign policy of England has\r\nalso been commercial, but it has been influenced at times by noble\r\nsentiment and splendid imagination as well. The first question the\r\nGerman statesman, in whose vocabulary of state-craft the word\r\nimagination does not occur, asks himself and other nations when any\r\nevent happens abroad to demand imperial attention is--how does it\r\naffect Germany's economic and commercial interests, future as well as\r\npresent? What is Germany going to get out of it? The manner in which\r\non various occasions during the reign the question has been propounded\r\nhas excited criticism bordering on indignation abroad, but it should\r\nbe recognized that it has invariably been answered in the long run by\r\nGermany in the spirit of compromise and conciliation.\r\n\r\nHowever, all civilized nations nowadays see that war is the least\r\nsatisfactory method of adjusting national quarrels, and the tendency\r\nis happily growing among them to pursue a commercial, an economic\r\npolicy, a policy of peace. This is true Weltpolitik, true\r\nworld-policy. Time was when wars were the unavoidable result of\r\nconditions then prevailing; but conditions have greatly altered, and\r\nwar, as there is abundant evidence to show, is to-day, in almost every\r\ncase, avoidable by all civilized peoples. Formerly war deranged and\r\ndisturbed at any rate for the time being, the commerce and industries\r\nof the countries engaged in it; to-day, as Mr. Norman Angell\r\ndemonstrates, it deranges and disturbs commerce and industry all over\r\nthe world. The derangement and disturbance may, it is true, be only\r\ntemporary; but there is, as always, the loss of life among the youth\r\nof the countries engaged in war to be remembered. Granted that it is\r\npleasant and honourable to die for one's country. Let us hope the time\r\nis coming when it will be equally pleasant and honourable to live for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe have done with Morocco, but to round off the record for 1905\r\nmention should be made of an incident in the Emperor's life which was\r\na source of great pleasure to him after his return from his journey\r\nthither. The marriage of his eldest son, the Crown Prince, took place\r\nin the Chapel Royal of the Berlin palace on June 15, 1905, to the\r\nyoung Duchess Cecile of Mecklenburg-Schwerin, whose character has been\r\nalluded to elsewhere and whom all Germans look forward with pleasure\r\nto seeing one day their Empress. The marriage naturally was attended\r\nby rejoicings in Berlin similar to those shown when the Emperor was\r\nmarried in 1881. Their chief popular feature, now as then, was the\r\nformal entry into the capital, and its chief domestic feature a grand\r\nwedding breakfast at the Emperor's palace. On the occasion of the\r\nlatter, the Emperor, rising from his seat and using the familiar _Du_\r\nand _Dich_ (thou and thee), addressed his newly-made daughter-in-law\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"My dear daughter Cecilie,--Let me, on behalf of my wife and\r\n     my whole House, heartily welcome you as a member of my House\r\n     and my family circle. You have come to us like a Queen of\r\n     Spring amid roses and garlands, and under endless\r\n     acclamations of the people such as my Residence city has not\r\n     known for long. A circle of noble guests has assembled to\r\n     celebrate this high and joyful festival with us, but not\r\n     only those present, but also those who are, alas, no more,\r\n     are with us in spirit: your illustrious father and my\r\n     parents.\r\n\r\n     \"A hundred thousand beaming faces have enthusiastically\r\n     greeted you; they have, however, not merely shone with\r\n     pleasure, but whoever can look deeper into the heart of man\r\n     could have seen in their eyes the question--a question which\r\n     can only be answered by your whole life and conduct, the\r\n     question, How will it turn out?\r\n\r\n     \"You and your husband are about to found a home together.\r\n     The people has its examples in the past to live up to. The\r\n     examples which have preceded you, dear Cecilie, have been\r\n     already eloquently mentioned--Queen Louise and other\r\n     Princesses who have sat on the Prussian throne. They are the\r\n     standards according to which the people will judge your\r\n     life, while you, my dear son, will be judged according to\r\n     the standard Providence set up in your illustrious\r\n     great-grandfather.\r\n\r\n     \"You, my daughter, have been received by us with open arms\r\n     and will be honoured and cherished. To both of you I wish\r\n     from my heart God's richest blessings. Let your home be\r\n     founded on God and our Saviour. As He is the most impressive\r\n     personality which has left its illuminating traces on the\r\n     earth up to the present time, which finds an echo in the\r\n     hearts of mankind and impels them to imitate it, so may your\r\n     career imitate His, and thus will you also fulfil the laws\r\n     and follow the traditions of our House.\r\n\r\n     \"May your home be a happy one and an example for the younger\r\n     generation, in accordance with the fine sentence which William\r\n     the Great once wrote down as his confession of faith; 'My powers\r\n     belong to the world and my country.' Accept my blessing for your\r\n     lives. I drink to the health of the young married couple.\"\r\n\r\nThe record of this memorable year may be closed with mention of an\r\ninstitution which is not only a special care of the Emperor's, but is\r\nalso a landmark in the relation of Germany and America which may prove\r\nto be the forerunner, if it has not already done so, of similar\r\ninterchange of ideas and information between nations which only\r\nrequire mutually to understand each other in order to be the best of\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nThe system of an annual exchange of professors between America and\r\nGermany was suggested, it is believed, to the Emperor in this year by\r\nHerr Althoff, the Prussian Minister of Education. The Emperor took up\r\nthe idea with enthusiasm, and after discussing it with Dr. Nicholas\r\nMurray Butler, President of Columbia University, who was invited to\r\nWilhelmshohe for the purpose, had it finally elaborated by the\r\nPrussian Ministry of Education which now superintends its working.\r\n\r\nThe original idea of an exchange only between Harvard and Berlin\r\nUniversity professors was, thanks to the liberality of an American\r\ncitizen, Mr. Speyer, extended almost simultaneously by the\r\nestablishment of what are known as \"Roosevelt\" professorships. The\r\nholders of these positions, unlike the original \"exchange\" professors\r\nbetween Harvard and Berlin only, may be chosen by the trustees of\r\nColumbia University from any American university and can exchange\r\nduties for two terms, instead of one in the place of the exchange\r\nprofessors, with the professors of any German University. Harvard\r\nprofessors have been succesively: Francis G. Peabody, Theodore W.\r\nRichards, William H. Scofield, William M. Davis, George F. Moore, H.\r\nMunsterberg, Theobald Smith, Charles S. Minog; and Roosevelt\r\nprofessors: J.W. Burgess, Arthur T. Hadley, Felix Adler, Benj. Ide\r\nWheeler, C. Alphonso Smith, Paul S. Reinsch, and William H. Sloane.\r\n\r\nWriting to the German Ambassador in Washington, Baron Speck von\r\nSternburg, in November, 1905, the Emperor said:\r\n\r\n     \"Express my fullest sympathy with the movement regarding the\r\n     exchange of professors. We are very well satisfied with\r\n     Professor Peabody, the first exchange professor, and\r\n     thankful to have him. He comes to me in my house, an\r\n     honourable and welcome guest. My hearty thanks also to Mr.\r\n     Speyer, for his fine gift for the erection of a\r\n     professorship in Berlin. The exchange of the learned is the\r\n     best means for both nations to know the inner nature of each\r\n     other, and from thence spring mutual respect and love, which\r\n     are securities for peace.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea of the exchange, as described by Professor John W. Burgess,\r\nof Columbia University, the first Roosevelt professor to Germany, is\r\n\r\n     \"an exchange of educators which has for its purpose the\r\n     bringing of the men of learning of one country into other\r\n     countries and by a comparison of fundamental ideas to arrive\r\n     at a world-philosophy and a world-morality upon which the\r\n     world's peace and the world's civilization may finally and\r\n     firmly rest.\"\r\n\r\nThe conception of a world-philosophy and a world-morality upon which\r\nthe world's peace and civilization may rest is not new, being now a\r\nlittle over 1900 years old, and, moreover, educators and men of\r\nscience in all countries are constantly exchanging ideas by personal\r\nvisits, correspondence, and publications; but in any case, the\r\nEmperor's exchange system has the advantage that it brings the\r\neducators into touch with large numbers of the rising generation in\r\nAmerica and Germany and undoubtedly helps towards a better mutual\r\nunderstanding of the relations, and in especial the economic\r\nrelations, of the two countries.\r\n\r\nIt has worked well, and the Emperor has encouraged it by showing\r\nconstant hospitality to the American professors who have come to\r\nBerlin since the system was instituted. One or two episodes have given\r\nrise to a diplomatic question as to whether or not exchange professors\r\nand their wives have the privilege of being presented at Court. The\r\nquestion has practically been decided in the negative. This, however,\r\ndoes not prevent the Emperor entertaining the professors at his\r\npalace, or making the acquaintance of the professors' wives on other\r\nthan Court ceremonious occasions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEFORE THE \"NOVEMBER STORM\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1906-1907\r\n\r\nIn the domestic life of the Emperor during these years fall two or\r\nthree events of more than ordinary interest. From the dynastic point\r\nof view was of importance the birth of a son and heir to the Crown\r\nPrince in the Marble Palace at Potsdam.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor was at sea, on his annual northern trip, when the birth\r\noccurred. As the ship approached Bergen the town was seen to be gaily\r\ndecorated with flags. As it happened, everybody on board knew of the\r\nbirth except the Emperor, but none of the officers round him ventured\r\nto congratulate him, because they supposed he knew of it already and\r\nwere waiting for him to refer to it. At Bergen the German Minister,\r\nStuebel, and German Consul, Mohr, came on board. The Minister, being a\r\ndiplomatist, said nothing, but the Consul, as Consuls will, spoke his\r\nmind and ventured his congratulations. \"What? I am a grandfather!\"\r\nexclaimed the Emperor. \"Why, that's splendid! and I knew nothing about\r\nit!\" The captain of the ship then asked should he fire the salute of\r\ntwenty-one guns usual on such occasions. \"No,\" said the Emperor, \"that\r\nwon't do. Mohr is a great talker. Let us first see the official\r\ndespatches from Berlin.\" The party, including the Emperor, went down\r\ninto the cabin to await the despatches, which were being brought from\r\nBergen.\r\n\r\nOn their arrival a basketful of State papers was placed before the\r\nEmperor. The first one he took out was a telegram from the Sultan of\r\nTurkey with congratulations (great merriment); the second from an\r\nunknown lady in Berlin, with a name corresponding to the English\r\n\"Brown,\" with four lines of congratulatory poetry; and it was not\r\nuntil more than a hundred despatches had been opened that they came to\r\none from the Minister of the Interior and another from the Empress\r\nannouncing the birth. Popular reports at the time represented the\r\nEmperor as boiling over with anger at his being kept or left in\r\nignorance of the happy event. As a matter of fact, he was in high\r\ngood-humour, and himself mentioned a similar occurrence at Metz in\r\n1870, when an important movement of the French army was not reported\r\nbecause it was assumed that it was already known to the Intelligence\r\nDepartment. As a public sign of his satisfaction he amnestied the\r\nhalf-dozen of his subjects who happened to be in gaol as punishment\r\nfor _lèse majesté_.\r\n\r\nAnother domestic event at this time was the celebration by the Emperor\r\nand Empress of their silver wedding. Berlin, of course, was\r\nilluminated and beflagged. There was a great gathering of royal\r\nrelatives, a State banquet, and a special parade of troops. At the\r\nlatter were remarkable for their huge proportions two former\r\ngrenadiers of the regiment of Guards the Emperor commanded in his\r\nyouth. They were now settled in America, but came over to Germany on\r\nthe Emperor's particular invitation and, of course, at his private\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nThe last item of domestic interest this year (1906) worth record was\r\nthe marriage of Prince Eitel Frederick, the Emperor's second son, with\r\nPrincess Sophie Charlotte of Oldenburg. In his speech to the bridal\r\npair on their wedding-day the Emperor referred to the personal\r\nlikeness the young Prince bore to his great-grandfather, Emperor\r\nWilliam, and expressed the hope that the Prince might grow more like\r\nhim in character from year to year.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Emperor had to pass through a season of great annoyance\r\nowing to the scandal which arose in connection with the so-called\r\n\"Camarilla.\" The existence of a small and secret group of viciously\r\nminded men among the Emperor's entourage was disclosed to the public\r\nby the well-known pamphleteer, Maximilian Harden, a Jew by birth named\r\nWitowski, who as a younger man had been on semi-confidential terms\r\nwith Prince Bismarck and subsequently with Foreign Secretary von\r\nHolstein. As a result of Harden's disclosures some highly placed\r\nfriends of the Emperor were compromised and had ultimately to\r\ndisappear from public life as well as from the Court. It was perfectly\r\nevident throughout that the Emperor had been totally ignorant of the\r\nprivate character of the men forming the \"Camarilla,\" and nothing was\r\nproved to show that the group which formed it had ever unduly, or\r\nindeed in any fashion, influenced him.\r\n\r\nAn allusion made to the scandal by a deputy in the Reichstag brought\r\nthe Chancellor, Prince von Bülow, to his feet in defence of the\r\nmonarch. \"The view,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"that the monarch in Germany should not have his own\r\n     opinions as to State and Government, and should only think\r\n     what his Ministers desire him to think, is contrary to\r\n     German State law and contrary to the will of the German\r\n     people\"\r\n\r\n(\"Quite right,\" on the Right). \"The German people,\" continued the\r\nChancellor,\r\n\r\n     \"want no shadow-king, but an Emperor of flesh and blood. The\r\n     conduct and statements of a strong personality like the\r\n     Emperor's are not tantamount to a breach of the\r\n     Constitution. Can you tell me a single case in which the\r\n     Emperor has acted contrary to the Constitution?\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor concluded:\r\n\r\n     \"As to a Camarilla--Camarilla is no German word. It is a\r\n     hateful, foreign, poisonous plant which no one has ever\r\n     tried to introduce into Germany without doing great injury\r\n     to the people and to the Prince. Our Emperor is a man of far\r\n     too upright a character and much too clear-headed to seek\r\n     counsel in political things from any other quarter than his\r\n     appointed advisers and his own sense of duty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Camarilla scandal was all the more painful as it was made a ground\r\nfor insinuations disgraceful to German officers as a body. Such\r\ninsinuations were, as they would be to-day, entirely unfounded.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that annoyed the Emperor this year was the publication\r\nof ex-Chancellor Prince Hohenlohe's Memoirs. The publication drew from\r\nhim a telegram to a son of the ex-Chancellor in which he expressed his\r\n\"astonishment and indignation\" at the publication of confidential\r\nprivate conversations between him and Prince Hohenlohe regarding\r\nPrince Bismarck's dismissal. \"I must stigmatize,\" the Emperor\r\ntelegraphed,\r\n\r\n     \"such conduct as in the last degree tactless, indiscreet,\r\n     and entirely inopportune. It is a thing unheard-of that\r\n     occurrences relating to a sovereign reigning at the time\r\n     should be published without his permission.\"\r\n\r\nGermans as a people are passionately fond of dancing, and though\r\neverybody knows that the people of Vienna bear away the palm in this\r\nrespect, claim to be the best waltzers in the world. The Emperor,\r\naccordingly, won great popularity among the dancers of his realm this\r\nyear by lending a favourable ear to the sighing of the young ladies of\r\nthe provincial town of Crefeld for a regiment which would provide them\r\nwith a supply of dancing partners. The Emperor took occasion to visit\r\nthe town, and brought with him a regiment of the Guards from\r\nDüsseldorf to form part of the new garrison. He was received by the\r\ncity authorities, and was at the same time, doubtless, greeted from\r\nbalcony and window by multitudes of fair-haired Crefeld maidens, who\r\nlooked with delightful anticipations on the gallant soldiers, who were\r\nto relieve the tedium of their evenings, riding by. \"To-day,\" the\r\nEmperor told the assembled city fathers, \"I have kept my word to the\r\ntown of Crefeld, and when I make a promise I keep it too (stormy\r\napplause). I have brought the town its garrison and the young ladies\r\ntheir dancers.\" The \"stormy applause\" was again renewed--amid, one may\r\nimagine, the enthusiastic waving of pocket-handkerchiefs from the\r\nwindows and the balconies.\r\n\r\nThe salient feature of foreign politics just now was, naturally, the\r\nclose on March 31st of the Conference of Algeciras. Its results have\r\nbeen referred to in the chapter on Morocco, and mention need only be\r\nmade here of the famous telegram regarding it sent by the Emperor on\r\nApril 12th of this year (1906) to the Foreign Minister of Austria,\r\nCount Goluchowski. \"A capital example of good faith among allies!\" he\r\ntelegraphed to the Count, meaning Austria's support of Germany at\r\nAlgeciras. \"You showed yourself a brilliant second in the tourney, and\r\ncan reckon on the like service from me on a similar occasion.\"\r\n\r\nInternal affairs, and particularly the parliamentary situation in\r\nGermany, had during the three or four years before that of the\r\n\"November Storm\" demanded a good deal of the Emperor's attention. The\r\neverlasting fight with the rebel angels of the Hohenzollern heaven,\r\nthe Social Democracy, had been going on all through the reign. Now the\r\nEmperor would fulminate against it, now his Chancellor, Prince von\r\nBülow, would attack it with brilliant ability and sarcasm in\r\nParliament. Still the Social Democratic movement grew, still the\r\n_Vorwärts_, the party organ, continued to rail at industrial\r\ncapitalists and the large landowners alike, still Herr Lucifer-Bebel\r\nbitterly assailed every measure of the Government. The fact seems to\r\nbe that the people were getting restive under the imperial burdens the\r\nEmperor's world-policy entailed. The cost of living, partly as a\r\nresult of the new German tariff, with maximum and minimum duties,\r\nwhich now replaced the Caprivi commercial treaties, was steadily\r\nrising. The Morocco episode had ended without territorial gain, if\r\nwith no loss of national honour or prestige. The Poles were\r\nantagonized afresh by a stricter application of the Settlement Law for\r\nGermanizing Prussian Poland. Colonial troubles in South-west Africa\r\nwith Herero and other recalcitrant tribes were making heavy demands on\r\nthe Treasury.\r\n\r\nThe parliamentary situation was, as usual, at the mercy of the Centrum\r\nparty, which, with its hundred or more members, can always make a\r\nmajority by combining with Liberal parties of the Left (including the\r\nSocialists) or Conservative parties of the Right. In December, 1906,\r\nwhen the Budget was laid before Parliament, it was found to contain a\r\ndemand for about £1,500,000 for the troops in South-west Africa. The\r\nCentrum refused to grant more than £1,000,000, and required, moreover,\r\nan undertaking that the number of troops in the colony should be\r\nreduced. The Social Democrats, with a number of Progressives and other\r\nLeft parties sufficient to form a majority, joined the Centrum, and\r\nthe Government demand was rejected by 177 to 168 votes. On the result\r\nof the voting being declared, Chancellor von Bülow solemnly rose and\r\ndrew a paper from his pocket. It was an order from the Emperor\r\ndissolving Parliament.\r\n\r\nThe general elections were to be held in January following, and great\r\nefforts were made by the Emperor and Chancellor to secure a Government\r\nmajority against the combined Centrists and Socialists. The country\r\nwas appealed to to say whether Germany should lose her African\r\ncolonies or not; a patriotic response was made, and, though the\r\nCentrum, as always, came back to Parliament in undiminished strength,\r\nthe Socialists lost one-half of their eighty seats.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, needless to say, was tremendously gratified. On the night\r\nthe final results were announced he gave a large dinner-party at the\r\nPalace, and read out to the Royal Family and his guests the bulletins\r\nas they came in. Towards one o'clock in the morning the official\r\ntotals were known. The streets were knee-deep in snow, but the people\r\nwere not deterred from making a demonstration in their thousands\r\nbefore the palace. By and by lights were seen moving hurriedly to and\r\nfro along the first floor containing the Emperor's apartments. A\r\ngeneral illumination of the suite of rooms followed, a window was\r\nthrown up, and the Emperor, bare-headed, was seen in the opening.\r\nInstantly complete stillness fell on the vast square, and the Emperor,\r\nleaning far out over the balcony, and evidently much excited, spoke in\r\nstentorian tones and with a dramatic waving of his right arm as\r\nfollows: \"Gentlemen!\"--the \"gentlemen\" included half the hooligans of\r\nBerlin, but such are the accidents of political life--\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen! This fine ovation springs from the feeling that\r\n     you are proud of having done your duty by your country. In\r\n     the words of our great Chancellor (Bismarck), who said that\r\n     if the Germans were once put in the saddle they would soon\r\n     learn to ride, you can ride and you will ride, and ride\r\n     down, any one who opposes us, especially when all classes\r\n     and creeds stand fast together. Do not let this hour of\r\n     triumph pass as a moment of patriotic enthusiasm, but keep\r\n     to the road on which you have started.\"\r\n\r\nThe speech closed with a verse from Kleist's \"Prince von Homburg,\" a\r\nfavourite monarchist drama of the Emperor's, conveying the idea that\r\ngood Hohenzollern rule had knocked bad Social-Democratic agitation\r\ninto a cocked hat.\r\n\r\nThe result of the elections enabled the Chancellor to form a new\r\n\"bloc\" party in Parliament, consisting of conservatives and Liberals,\r\non whose united aid he could rely in promoting national measures. As\r\nthe Chancellor said, he did not expect Conservatives to turn into\r\nLiberals and Liberals into Conservatives overnight nor did he expect\r\nthe two parties to vote solid on matters of secondary interest and\r\nimportance; but he expected them to support the Government on\r\nquestions that concerned the welfare of the whole Empire.\r\n\r\nBefore 1907, the year we have now reached, Franco-German and\r\nAnglo-German relations had long varied from cool to stormy. They had\r\nnot for many years been at \"set-fair,\" nor have they apparently\r\nreached that halcyon stage as yet. During the Moroccan troubles it was\r\ngenerally believed that on two or three occasions war was imminent\r\neither between France and Germany or between Germany and England. That\r\nthere was such a danger at the time of M. Delcassé's retirement from\r\nthe conduct of French foreign affairs just previous to the Algeciras\r\nConference is a matter of general conviction in all countries; but\r\nthere is no publicly known evidence that danger of war between England\r\nand Germany has been acute at any time of recent years. Nor at any\r\ntime of recent years has the bulk of the people in either country\r\nreally desired or intended war. There has been international\r\nexasperation, sometimes amounting to hostility, continuously; but it\r\nwas largely due to Chauvinism on both sides, and was in great measure\r\ncounteracted by the efforts of public-spirited bodies and men in both\r\ncountries, by international visits of amity and goodwill, and by the\r\ndetermination of both the English and German Governments not to go to\r\nwar without good and sufficient cause.\r\n\r\nAmong the most striking testimonies to this determination was the\r\nvisit of the Emperor to England in November, 1907.\r\n\r\nThe visit was made expressly an affair of State. The Emperor was\r\naccompanied by the Empress, and the visit became a pageant and a\r\ndemonstration--a pageant in respect of the national honours paid to\r\nthe imperial guests and a demonstration of national regard and respect\r\nfor them as friends of England. Nothing could have been simpler, or\r\nmore tactful or more sincere than the utterances, private as well as\r\npublic, of the Emperor throughout his stay. His very first speech, the\r\nfew words he addressed to the Mayor of Windsor, displayed all three\r\nqualities. \"It seems to me,\" he said, \"like a home-coming when I enter\r\nWindsor. I am always pleased to be here.\" At the Guildhall\r\nsubsequently, referring to the two nations, he used, and not for the\r\nfirst time, the phrase \"Blood is thicker than water.\"\r\n\r\nAt the Guildhall, on this occasion, the Emperor reminded his hearers\r\nthat he was a freeman of the City of London, having been the recipient\r\nof that honour from the hands of Lord Mayor Sir Joseph Savory on his\r\naccession visit to London in 1891. He then referred to the visit of\r\nthe Lord Mayor, Sir William Treloar, to Berlin the year previous, and\r\npromised a similar hearty welcome to any deputation from the City of\r\nLondon to his capital. \"In this place sixteen years ago,\" continued\r\nthe Emperor,\r\n\r\n     \"I said that all my efforts would be directed to the\r\n     preservation of peace. History will do me the justice of\r\n     recognizing that I have unfalteringly pursued this aim. The\r\n     main support, however, and the foundation of the world's\r\n     peace is the maintenance of good relations between our two\r\n     countries. I will, in future also, do all I can to\r\n     strengthen them, and the wishes of my people are at one with\r\n     my own in this.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession that followed upon the visit to the Guildhall made a\r\nspecial impression on the Emperor. \"I was so close to the people,\" he\r\nsaid afterwards,\r\n\r\n     \"who were assembled in hundreds of thousands, that I could\r\n     look straight into their eyes, and from the expression on\r\n     their faces I could see that their reception of the Empress\r\n     and myself was no artificial welcome but an out-and-out\r\n     sincere one. That stirred us deeply and gave us great\r\n     satisfaction. The Empress and I will take back with us\r\n     recollections of London and England we shall never forget.\"\r\n\r\nWhile at Windsor the Emperor received a deputation of sixteen members\r\nof Oxford University, headed by Lord Curzon, who came to present him\r\nwith the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws voted him by the University\r\nwhile he was still on his way to England. It was a picturesque scene:\r\nthe members of the University in their academic robes were surrounded\r\nby a brilliant company representing the intellect of the country; and\r\nthe Emperor, with the doctor's hood over his field-marshal's uniform,\r\nwas the cynosure of all eyes.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's reply to Lord Curzon's address, highly complimentary to\r\nthe University though it was, was perhaps chiefly remarkable for the\r\nexpression of his expectations from the Rhodes' Scholarship\r\nfoundation. \"The gift of your great fellow-countryman, Cecil Rhodes,\"\r\nhe said,\r\n\r\n     \"affords an opportunity to students, not only from the\r\n     British colonies, but also from Germany and the United\r\n     States, to obtain the benefits of an Oxford education. The\r\n     opportunity afforded to young Germans during their period of\r\n     study to mix with young Englishmen is one of the most\r\n     satisfactory results of Rhodes's far-seeing mind. Under the\r\n     auspices of the Oxford _alma mater_, the young students will\r\n     have an opportunity of studying the character and qualities\r\n     of the respective nations, of fostering by this means the\r\n     spirit of good comradeship, and creating an atmosphere of\r\n     mutual respect and friendship between the two countries.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor had always admired the Colossus of South Africa,\r\ndiscerning in him no doubt many of those attributes which he felt\r\nexisted in himself or which he would like to think existed; and the\r\nadmiration stood the test of personal acquaintance when Cecil Rhodes\r\nvisited Berlin in March, 1899, in connexion with his scheme for the\r\nCape to Cairo railway. It does not sound very complimentary to his own\r\nsubjects, the \"salt of the earth,\" but it is on record that the\r\nEmperor then said to Rhodes that he wished \"he had more men like him.\"\r\nAt the close of the visit the Empress returned to Germany, while the\r\nEmperor took a much needed rest-cure for three weeks at Highcliffe\r\nCastle, a country mansion in Hampshire he rented for the purpose from\r\nits owner, Colonel Stuart-Wortley.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this work, it may have been noticed, no particular\r\nattention has been devoted to the Emperor in his military capacity.\r\nThe reason is, because it is taken for granted that all the world\r\nknows the Emperor in his character as War Lord, that he is practically\r\nnever out of uniform, and that his care for the army is only\r\nsecond--if it is second--to that for the stability and power of his\r\nmonarchy. The two things in fact are closely identified, and, from the\r\nEmperor's standpoint, on both together depend the security, and to a\r\nlarge extent the prosperity, of the Empire. He knows or believes that\r\nGermany is surrounded by hordes of potential enemies, as a lighthouse\r\nis often surrounded by an ocean that, while treacherously calm, may at\r\nany time rage about the edifice; that round the lighthouse are\r\ngathered his folk, who look to it for safety; and that the monarchy is\r\nthe lighthouse itself, a _rocher de bronze_, towering above all.\r\n\r\nIn this connexion it may be noted that the army in Germany is not a\r\nmercenary body like the English army, but is simply and solely a\r\ncertain portion of the people, naturally the younger men, passing for\r\ntwo or three years, according as they serve in the infantry or\r\ncavalry, through the ranks. The system of recruiting, as everybody\r\nknows, is called conscription; it ought rather to be described as a\r\nsystem of national education, whereby the rude and raw youth of the\r\ncountry is converted into an admirable class of well-disciplined,\r\nself-respecting and healthy, as well as patriotic, citizens. The\r\nEmperor believes, contrary to the opinion of many English army\r\nofficers, that a man to be a good soldier must also be a good\r\nChristian, and thus we find him enforcing, or trying to enforce, among\r\nhis officers the moral qualities which Christianity is meant to\r\nfoster.\r\n\r\nAmong these qualities is simplicity of life, and as a result of\r\nsimplicity of life, contentment with simple and not too costly\r\npleasures. We saw the Emperor as a young colonel forbidding his\r\nofficers to join a Berlin club where gambling was prevalent. This\r\nyear, after a luxurious lunch at one of the regimental messes, he\r\nissues an order, or rather an edict, expressing his wish that officers\r\nin their messes should content themselves with simpler food and wines,\r\nand in particular that when he himself is a guest, the meal should\r\nconsist only of soup, fish, vegetables, a roast and cheese. Ordinary\r\nred or white table-wine, a glass of \"bowl\" (\"cup\"), or German\r\nchampagne should be handed round. Liqueurs, or other forms of what the\r\nFrench know as \"chasse-café,\" after dinner were best avoided. The\r\nedict of course caused amusement as well as a certain amount of\r\ndiscontent with what was felt to be a kind of objectionable paternal\r\ninterference, and it is doubtful whether it has had much lasting\r\neffect. Even now, the German officer laughingly tells one that when\r\nthe Emperor dines at an officers' mess either French champagne (which\r\nis infinitely superior to German) is poured into German champagne\r\nbottles, or else the French label is carefully shrouded in a napkin\r\nthat swathes the bottle up to the neck. Apropos of German champagne, a\r\nstory is current that Bismarck, one day dining at the palace, refused\r\nthe German champagne being handed round. The Emperor noticed the\r\nrefusal and said pointedly to Bismarck: \"I always drink German\r\nchampagne, because I think it right to encourage our national\r\nindustries. Every patriot should do so.\" \"Your Majesty,\" replied the\r\ngrim old Chancellor, \"my patriotism does not extend to my stomach.\"\r\n\r\nIn the domain of æsthetics this year the Emperor had some pleasant and\r\nsome painful experiences. Joachim, the great violinist, and a great\r\nfavourite of his, died in August, and his death was followed next\r\nmonth, September, by that of the composer Grieg, the \"Chopin of the\r\nNorth,\" as the Emperor called him, whose friendship the Emperor had\r\nacquired on one of his Norwegian trips. Quite at the end of the year\r\nhis early tutor, Dr. Hinzpeter, for whom he always had a semi-filial\r\nregard, passed away.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, among the Emperor's pleasant experiences may be\r\nreckoned the visit of Mr. Beerbohm Tree and his English company to the\r\nGerman capital. Their repertory of Shakespearean drama greatly\r\ndelighted the Emperor, who expressed his pleasure to Mr. Tree and his\r\nfellow-players personally, and did not dismiss them without\r\nsubstantial tokens of his appreciation.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the year the French actress, Suzanne Deprès, visited Berlin\r\nand appealed strongly to the Emperor's taste for the \"classical\" in\r\nmusic and drama. Inviting the actress to the royal box, he said to\r\nher:\r\n\r\n     \"You have shown us such a natural, living Phædra that we\r\n     were all strongly moved. How fine a part it is! As a\r\n     youngster I used to learn verses from 'Phædra' by heart. I\r\n     am told that in France devotion to classical tradition is\r\n     growing weaker, and that Molière and Racine are more and\r\n     more seldom played. What a pity! Our people, on the\r\n     contrary, remain faithful to their great poets and enjoy\r\n     their works. After school comes college, and after\r\n     college--the theatre. It should elevate and expand the soul.\r\n     The people do not need any representation of reality--they\r\n     are well acquainted with that in their daily lives. One must\r\n     put something greater and nobler before them, something\r\n     superior to 'La Dame aux Camélias.'\"\r\n\r\nA month later, however, he made one of his extremely rare visits to an\r\nordinary Berlin theatre to see--\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\"!\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in domestic politics Chancellor von Bülow's famous \"bloc\"\r\ncontinued to work satisfactorily, notwithstanding difficulties arising\r\nfrom the conflicting interests of industry and agriculture, Free Trade\r\nand Protection and differences of creed and race. At the end of this\r\nyear it was near falling asunder in connection with the question of\r\njudicial reform, but Prince von Bülow kept it together for a while by\r\nan impassioned appeal to the patriotism of both parties. In the course\r\nof the speech he told the House how, when he was standing at\r\nBismarck's death-bed, he noticed on the wall the portrait of a man,\r\nLudwig Uhland, who had said \"no head could rule over Germany that was\r\nnot well anointed with democratic oil,\" and drew the conclusion from\r\nthe contrast between the dying man of action and the poet that only\r\nthe union of old Prussian conservative energy and discipline with\r\nGerman broad-hearted, liberal spirit could secure a happy future for\r\nthe nation. The \"bloc,\" as we shall see, broke up in 1909 and Prince\r\nvon Bülow resigned. The Chancellor afterwards attributed his fall\r\nentirely to the Conservatives, but it is possible, even probable, that\r\nit was in at least some measure due to the events of the _annus\r\nmirabilis_, 1908, which now opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NOVEMBER STORM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1908\r\n\r\nThe \"November Storm\" was a collision between the Emperor and his folk,\r\na result of his so-called \"personal regiment.\"\r\n\r\nIn a general way the latter phrase is intended to describe and\r\ncharacterize the method of rule adopted by the Emperor from the very\r\nbeginning of his reign, especially as exhibited in his semi-official\r\nutterances, public and private, in his correspondence, private\r\nconversation, and public and private conduct generally. According to\r\nthe popular interpretation of the Imperial Constitution--the nearest\r\nthing to a Magna Charta in Germany--the Emperor should observe, in his\r\nwords and acts, a reserve which would prevent all chance of creating\r\ndissension among the federated States and in particular would secure\r\nthe avoidance of anything which might disturb Germany's relations to\r\nforeign countries or interfere with the course of Germany's foreign\r\npolicy as carried on through the regular official channel, the Foreign\r\nOffice. The ground for this popular interpretation is a constitutional\r\ndevice which to an Englishman, if it be not offensive to say so, can\r\nonly recall the well-known definition of a metaphysician as \"a blind\r\nman, in a dark room, looking for a black cat, _which is not there_.\"\r\n\r\nThe device is known as the Chancellor's \"responsibility,\" which was\r\nregarded, and is still regarded in Germany, as at once \"covering\" the\r\nEmperor and offering to his folk a safeguard against unwisdom or\r\ncaprice on his part. The nature of this responsibility which is\r\nevidenced by the Chancellor signing the Emperor's edicts and other\r\nofficial statements, is so frequently discussed by German politicians,\r\nthe position of the Chancellor--the Grand Vizier of Germany he has\r\nbeen picturesquely called--is so influential, and the intercourse\r\nbetween the Emperor and the Chancellor is so close, exclusive, and\r\nconfidential, that an examination of the meaning of the term\r\n\"responsibility\" in this connexion is desirable.\r\n\r\nWhenever the Emperor does anything important or surprising, especially\r\nin foreign policy, the first question asked by his subjects is, has he\r\ntaken the step with the knowledge, and therefore with the joint\r\nresponsibility, of the Chancellor? If the answer is in the negative,\r\nit is the \"personal regiment\" again, and people are angry: if the\r\nlatter, they may disapprove of the step and grumble at it, but it is\r\ncovered by the Chancellor's signature and they can raise no\r\nconstitutional objection. Hence the demand usually made on such\r\noccasions for an Act of Parliament once for all defining fully and\r\nclearly the Chancellor's responsibilities. According to Prince von\r\nBülow, and it is doubtless the Emperor's own view, the responsibility\r\nmentioned in the Constitution is a \"moral responsibility,\" and only\r\nrefers to such acts and orders of the Emperor as immediately arise out\r\nof the governing rights vested in him, not to personal expressions of\r\nopinion, even though these may be made on formal occasions; and the\r\nPrince goes on to say that if a Chancellor cannot prevent what he\r\nhonestly thinks would permanently and in an important respect be\r\ninjurious to the Empire, he is bound to resign.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor, then, takes responsibility of some kind. But\r\nresponsibility to whom? To the Emperor? To the Parliament? To the\r\npeople? The answer is, solely to the Emperor, for it is the Emperor\r\nwho appoints and dismisses him as well as every other Minister,\r\nimperial or Prussian, and the Emperor is only responsible to his\r\nconscience. In parliamentarily ruled countries like England Ministers\r\nare responsible to Parliament, which expresses its disapproval by the\r\nvote of a hostile majority, or in certain circumstances by a vote of\r\ncensure or even impeachment. In Germany, where the parliamentary\r\nsystem of government does not exist, and where there is no upsetting\r\nMinistries by a hostile majority, and no parliamentary vote of censure\r\nor impeachment, no Minister, including the Chancellor, is responsible,\r\nin the English sense of the word, to Parliament; accordingly, a German\r\nChancellor may continue in office in spite of Parliament, provided of\r\ncourse the Emperor supports him. At the same time the Chancellor\r\nto-day is to some indefinable extent responsible to Parliament, and\r\ntherefore to the people, in so far as they are represented by it, for\r\nhe must keep on tolerable terms with Parliament as well as with the\r\nEmperor, or he will have to give up office. How he is to keep on terms\r\nwith a Parliament consisting of half a dozen powerful parties and as\r\nmany more smaller fractions and factions is probably the part of his\r\nduties that gives him most trouble and at times, doubtless, very\r\ndisagreeably interferes with the placidity of his slumbers.\r\n\r\nThere is no struggle for government in Germany between the Crown and\r\nthe people: Germans have no ancient Magna Charta, no Habeas Corpus, no\r\nDeclaration of Rights to look back to on the long road to liberty. In\r\nthe protracted struggle for government between the English people and\r\ntheir rulers, the people's victory took the form of parliamentary\r\ncontrol while retaining the monarch as their highest and most honoured\r\nrepresentative. Socially he is their master, politically their\r\nservant, the \"first servant of the State.\" In Germany there has never,\r\nsave for a few months in 1848, been any struggle of a similar\r\npolitical extent or kind. German monarchs including the Emperor, have\r\napplied the expression \"first servant of the State\" to themselves, but\r\nthey did not apply it in the English sense. They applied it more\r\naccurately. In Germany the State means the system, the mechanism of\r\ngovernment, inclusive of the monarch's office: in England the word\r\n\"State\" is more nearly equivalent to the word \"people.\" To serve the\r\nsystem, the government machinery, is the first duty of the monarch,\r\nand government is not a changing reflection of the people's will, but\r\na permanent apparatus for maintaining the power of the Crown,\r\nharmonizing and reconciling the sentiments and interests of all parts\r\nof the Empire, and for conducting foreign policy.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that legislation is made by the Reichstag, that the\r\nReichstag has the power of the purse, and that it is elected by\r\nuniversal suffrage; but in Germany the Government is above and\r\nindependent of the Reichstag; legislation is not made by the Reichstag\r\nalone, since it requires the agreement of the Federal Council and of\r\nthe Emperor, and--what is of great practical importance--Government\r\nissues directions as to how legislation shall be carried into effect.\r\nThe law of 1872 passed against the Jesuits forbade the \"activity\" of\r\nthe Order, but the interpretation of the word \"activity,\" and with it\r\nthe effects of the law, were left to the Government.\r\n\r\nKings of Prussia and German Emperors have never shown much affection\r\nfor their Parliaments: Parliaments are apt to act as a check upon\r\nmonarchy, and in Prussia in particular to interfere with the carrying\r\nout of the divinely imposed mission. This is not said sarcastically;\r\nand the Emperor, like some of his ancestors, has more than once\r\nexpressed the same thought. Parliaments in Germany only date from\r\nafter the French Revolution. After that event there came into\r\nexistence in Germany the Frankfurt Parliament (1848), the Erfurt\r\nParliament (1850), and the Parliament of the German Customs Union\r\n(1867). These, however, were not popularly elected Parliaments like\r\nthose of the present day, but gatherings of class delegates from the\r\nvarious Kingdoms and States composing the Germany and Austria of the\r\ntime. Since the Middle Ages there had always been quasi-popular\r\nassemblies in Prussia, but they too were not elected, and only\r\nrepresented classes, not constituencies. The present Parliaments in\r\nPrussia and the Empire are Constitutional Parliaments in the English\r\nsense, elected by universal suffrage, the one indirectly, the other\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\nThe present Prussian Diet dates from the \"First Unified Diet,\"\r\nsummoned by Frederick William IV in 1847, which was transformed next\r\nyear under pressure of the revolutionists into a \"national assembly.\"\r\nThis was treated a year after by General Wrangel almost exactly as\r\nCromwell treated the Rump. The General entered Berlin with the troops\r\nwhich a few weeks before had fought against the revolutionists of the\r\n\"March days.\" He passed along the Linden to the royal theatre, where\r\nthe \"national assembly\" was in session, and was met at the door by the\r\nleader of the citizens' guard with the proud words, \"The guard is\r\nresolved to protect the honour of the National Assembly and the\r\nfreedom of the people, and will only yield to force.\"\r\n\r\nWrangel took out his watch--one can imagine the old silver\r\n\"turnip\"--and with his thumb on the dial replied:\r\n\r\n     \"Tell your city guard that the force is here. I will be\r\n     responsible for the maintenance of order. The National\r\n     Assembly has fifteen minutes in which to leave the building\r\n     and the city guard in which to withdraw.\"\r\n\r\nIn a quarter of an hour the building was empty, and next day the city\r\nguard was dissolved. A month later the King, Frederick William IV,\r\ngranted his _octroyierte_ Constitution--that is, a concession of his\r\nown royal personal will--which established the Diet as it is to-day.\r\n\r\nEmperor William I, as King of Prussia, had a good deal of trouble with\r\nhis Parliament, and in 1852 wanted to abdicate rather than rule in\r\nobedience to a parliamentary majority--it was the \"conflict time\"\r\nabout funds for army reorganization. Bismarck dissuaded him from doing\r\nso by promising to become Minister and carry on the government, if\r\nneed were, without a parliament and without a budget. He actually did\r\nso for some years, but there was no change in the Constitution as a\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nNor has there been any constitutional change in the relations of Crown\r\nto Parliament during the present reign. As a young man, the Emperor\r\nhad of course nothing to do with Parliament, Prussian or Imperial, and\r\nsince his accession, though there is always latent antagonism and has\r\nbeen even friction at times, he has, generally speaking, lived on\r\n\"correct,\" if not friendly terms with it. There is little, if any, of\r\nthe devoted affection one finds for the monarch in the English\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nAnd not unnaturally. Early in his reign, in 1891, he made a reference\r\nto Parliament little calculated to evoke affection. \"The soldier and\r\nthe army,\" he said to his generals at a banquet in the palace, \"not\r\nparliamentary majorities and decisions, have welded together the\r\nGerman Empire. My confidence is in the army--as my grandfather said at\r\nCoblenz: 'These are the gentlemen on whom I can rely.'\" Again, a year\r\nor two afterwards he dissolved the Reichstag for refusing to accept a\r\nmilitary bill and did not conceal his anger with the recalcitrant\r\nmajority. In 1895 he telegraphed to Bismarck his indignation with the\r\nReichstag for refusing to vote its congratulations on the old\r\nstatesman's eightieth birthday. In 1897, speaking of the kingship \"von\r\nGottes Gnaden\" he took occasion to quote his grandfather's declaration\r\nthat \"it was a kingship with onerous duties from which no man, no\r\nMinister, no Parliament, no people\" could release the Prince. In 1903\r\nhis Chancellor, Prince Bülow, had to defend in Parliament his action\r\nin the case of the Swinemunde despatch already mentioned. Attention\r\nwas called to the telegram in the Reichstag and the Chancellor\r\ndefended the Emperor. He denied that the telegram was an act of\r\nState--it was a personal matter between two sovereigns, the statement\r\nof a friend to a friend. \"The idea,\" said the Chancellor, who\r\ncontended that the Emperor had a right to express his opinions like\r\nany citizen,\r\n\r\n     \"that the monarch's expression of opinion is to be limited\r\n     by a stipulation that every such expression must be endorsed\r\n     with the signature of the Chancellor is wholly foreign to\r\n     the Constitution.\"\r\n\r\nNext day the Chancellor had again occasion to defend his imperial\r\nmaster against a charge of being \"anti-social,\" brought by the\r\nSocialist von Vollmar, who coupled the charge with insinuations of\r\nabsolutism and Cæsarism. Prince Bülow said:\r\n\r\n     \"Absolutism is not a German word, and is not a German\r\n     institution. It is an Asiatic plant, and one cannot talk of\r\n     absolutism in Germany so long as our circumstances develop\r\n     in an organic and legal manner, respecting the rights of the\r\n     Crown, which are just as sacred as the rights of the\r\n     burgher; respecting also law and order, which are not\r\n     disregarded 'from above,' and will not be disregarded. If\r\n     ever our circumstances take on an absolute, a Cæsarian,\r\n     form, it will be as the consequence of revolution, of\r\n     convulsion. For on revolution follows Cæsarism as W follows\r\n     U--that is the rule in the A B C of the world's history.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no harm in reminding Prince Bülow that the letter V--which\r\nmay be a very important link in the chain of events--comes between U\r\nand W. It is clear also that the Chancellor must have forgotten his\r\nEnglish history for the moment, for though Cromwell's rule may be\r\ncalled Cæsarism of a kind, the reign of William III, of \"glorious,\r\npious, and immortal memory,\" which followed the revolution of 1688,\r\ncould not fairly be so named.\r\n\r\nThree years later, in 1906, Prince Bülow found it necessary to defend\r\nthe Emperor on the score of the \"personal regiment.\" \"The view,\"\r\nPrince Bülow said,\r\n\r\n     \"that the monarch should have no individual thoughts of his own\r\n     about State and government, but should only think with the heads\r\n     of his Ministers and only say what they tell him to say, is\r\n     fundamentally wrong--is inconsistent with State rights and with\r\n     the wish of the German people\";\r\n\r\nand he concluded by challenging the House to mention a single case in\r\nwhich the Emperor had acted unconstitutionally. None of these\r\nbickerings between Crown and Parliament went to the root of the\r\nconstitutional relations between them, but they betrayed the existence\r\nof popular dissatisfaction with the Emperor, which in a couple of\r\nyears was to culminate in an outbreak of national anger.\r\n\r\nAn occurrence calls for mention here, not only as a kind of harbinger\r\nof the \"storm,\" but as one of the chief incidents which in the course\r\nof recent years have troubled Anglo-German relations. The incident\r\nreferred to is that of the so-called \"Tweedmouth Letter,\" which was an\r\nautograph letter from the Emperor to Lord Tweedmouth, First Lord of\r\nthe British Admiralty at the time, dated February 17, 1908, and\r\ncontaining among other matters a lengthy disquisition on naval\r\nconstruction, with reference to the excited state of feeling in\r\nEngland caused by Germany's warship-building policy. The letter has\r\nnever been published, but it is supposed to have been prompted by a\r\nstatement made publicly by Lord Esher, Warden of Windsor Castle, in\r\nthe London _Observer_, to the effect that nothing would more please\r\nthe German Emperor than the retirement of Sir John Fisher, the\r\noriginator of the Dreadnought policy, who was at the time First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty; and to have contained the remark that \"Lord Esher\r\nhad better attend to the drains at Windsor and leave alone matters\r\nwhich he did not understand.\" The Emperor was apparently unaware that\r\nLord Esher was one of the foremost military authorities in England.\r\n\r\nThe sending of the letter became known through the appearance of a\r\ncommunication in the London _Times_ of March 6th, with the caption\r\n\"Under which King?\"--an allusion to Shakespeare's \"Under which king,\r\nBezonian, speak or die\"--and signed \"Your Military Correspondent.\" The\r\nwriter announced that it had come to his knowledge that the German\r\nEmperor had recently addressed a letter to Lord Tweedmouth on the\r\nsubject of British and German naval policy, and that it was supposed\r\nthat the letter amounted to an attempt to influence, in German\r\ninterests, the Minister's responsibility for the British Naval\r\nEstimates. The correspondent concluded by demanding that the letter\r\nshould be laid before Parliament without delay. The _Times_, in a\r\nleading article, prognosticated the \"painful surprise and just\r\nindignation\" which must be felt by the people of Great Britain on\r\nlearning of such \"secret appeals to the head of a department on which\r\nthe nation's safety depends,\" and argued that there could be no\r\nquestion of privacy in a matter of the kind. The article concluded\r\nwith the assertion that the letter was obviously an attempt to \"make\r\nit more easy for German preparations to overtake our own.\" The\r\nincident was immediately discussed in all countries, publicly and\r\nprivately.\r\n\r\nEverywhere opinion was divided as to the defensibility of the\r\nEmperor's action; in France the division was reported by the _Times_\r\ncorrespondent to be \"bewildering.\" All the evidence available to prove\r\nthe Emperor's impulsiveness was recalled--the Kruger telegram, the\r\ntelegram to Count Goluchowski, the Austrian Minister of Foreign\r\nAffairs, after the Morocco Conference, characterizing him as a\r\n\"brilliant second (to Germany) in the bout at Algeciras,\" the\r\npremature telegram conferring the Order of Merit on General Stoessel\r\nafter the fall of Port Arthur, and other evidence, relevant and\r\nirrelevant. Reuter's agent in Berlin telegraphed on official authority\r\nthat the Emperor \"had written as a naval expert.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole, continental opinion may be said to have leaned in favour\r\nof the Emperor. Mr. Asquith, the English Prime Minister, at once made\r\nthe statement that the letter was a \"purely private communication,\r\ncouched in an entirely friendly spirit,\" that it had not been laid\r\nbefore the Cabinet, and that the latter had come to a decision about\r\nthe Estimates before the letter arrived.\r\n\r\nAll eyes and ears were now turned to Lord Tweedmouth, and on March\r\n10th he briefly referred to the matter in the House of Lords. He\r\nreceived the letter, he said, in the ordinary postal way; it was \"very\r\nfriendly in tone and quite informal\"; he showed it to Sir Edward Grey,\r\nwho agreed with him that it should be treated as a private letter, not\r\nas an official one; and he replied to it on February 20th, \"also in an\r\ninformal and friendly manner.\" A discussion, in which Lord Lansdowne\r\nand Lord Rosebery took part, followed, the former--to give the tone,\r\nnot the words of his speech--handing in a verdict of \"Not guilty, but\r\ndon't do it again,\" against the Emperor, and laying down the principle\r\nthat \"such a communication as that in question must not be allowed to\r\ncreate a diplomatic situation different from that which has been\r\nestablished through official channels and documents\"; and Lord\r\nRosebery, while he recognized the importance of the incident, seeking\r\nto minimize its effects by an attitude of banter. The treatment of the\r\nincident by the House of Commons as a whole gave considerable\r\nsatisfaction in Germany, where all efforts were directed to showing\r\nmalevolent hostility to Germany on the part of the _Times_.\r\n\r\nPrince von Bülow dealt with the letter in a speech on the second\r\nreading of the Budget on March 24, 1908. After referring to the Union\r\nInternationale Interparlementaire, which was to meet in a few months\r\nin Berlin, and to the \"very unsatisfactory situation in Morocco,\" he\r\nsaid:--\r\n\r\n     \"From various remarks which have been dropped in the course\r\n     of the debate I gather that this honourable House desires me\r\n     to make a statement as to the letter which his Majesty the\r\n     Kaiser last month wrote to Lord Tweedmouth. On grounds of\r\n     discretion, to the observance of which both the sender and\r\n     receiver of a private letter are equally entitled, I am not\r\n     in a position to lay the text of the letter before you, and\r\n     I add that I regret exceedingly that I cannot do so. The\r\n     letter could be signed by any one of us, by any sincere\r\n     friend of good relations between Germany and England (hear,\r\n     hear). The letter, gentlemen, was in form and substance a\r\n     private one, and at the same time its contents were of a\r\n     political nature. The one fact does not exclude the other;\r\n     and the letter of a sovereign, an imperial letter, does not,\r\n     from the fact that it deals with political questions, become\r\n     an act of State ('Very true,' on the Right).\r\n\r\n     \"This is not--and deputy Count Kanitz yesterday gave\r\n     appropriate instances in support--the first political letter\r\n     a sovereign has written, and our Kaiser is not the first\r\n     sovereign who has addressed to foreign statesmen letters of\r\n     a political character which are not subject to control. The\r\n     matter here concerns a right of action which all sovereigns\r\n     claim and which, in the case of our Kaiser also, no one has\r\n     a right to limit. How his Majesty proposes to make use of\r\n     this right we can confidently leave to the imperial sense of\r\n     duty. It is a gross, in no way justifiable\r\n     misrepresentation, to assert that his Majesty's letter to\r\n     Lord Tweedmouth amounts to an attempt to influence the\r\n     Minister responsible for the naval budget in the interests\r\n     of Germany, or that it denotes a secret interference in the\r\n     internal affairs of the British Empire. Our Kaiser is the\r\n     last person to believe that the patriotism of an English\r\n     Minister would suffer him to accept advice from a foreign\r\n     country as to the drawing up of the English naval budget\r\n     ('Quite right,' hear, hear). What is true of English\r\n     statesmen is true also of the leading statesmen of every\r\n     country which lays claim to respect for its independence\r\n     ('Very true'). In questions of defence of one's own country\r\n     every people rejects foreign interference and is guided only\r\n     by considerations bearing on its own security and its own\r\n     needs ('Quite right'). Of this right to self-judgment and\r\n     self-defence Germany also makes use when she builds a fleet\r\n     to secure the necessary protection for her coasts and her\r\n     commerce ('Bravo!'). This defensive, this purely defensive\r\n     character of our naval programme cannot, in view of the\r\n     incessant attempts to attribute to us aggressive views with\r\n     regard to England, be too often or too sharply brought\r\n     forward ('Bravo!'). We desire to live in peace and quietness\r\n     with England, and therefore it is embittering to find a\r\n     portion of the English Press ever speaking of the 'German\r\n     danger,' although the English fleet is many times stronger\r\n     than our own, although other lands have stronger fleets than\r\n     us and are working no less zealously at their development.\r\n     Nevertheless it is Germany, ever Germany, and only Germany,\r\n     against which public opinion on the other side of the\r\n     Channel is excited by an utterly valueless polemic ('Quite\r\n     right').\r\n\r\n     \"It would be, gentlemen,\"\r\n\r\nthe Chancellor continued,\r\n\r\n     \"in the interests of appeasement between both countries, it\r\n     would be in the interest of the general peace of the world,\r\n     that this polemic should cease. As little as we challenge\r\n     England's right to set up the naval standard her responsible\r\n     statesmen consider necessary for the maintenance of British\r\n     power in the world without our seeing therein a threat\r\n     against ourselves, so little can she take it ill of us if we\r\n     do not wish our naval construction to be wrongly represented\r\n     as a challenge against England (hear, hear, on the Right and\r\n     Left). Gentlemen, these are the thoughts, as I judge from\r\n     your assent, which we all entertain, which find expression\r\n     in the statements of all speakers, and which are in harmony\r\n     with all our views. Accept my additional statement that in\r\n     the letter of his Majesty to Lord Tweedmouth one gentleman,\r\n     one seaman, talks frankly to another, that our Kaiser highly\r\n     appreciates the honour of being an admiral of the British\r\n     navy, and that he is a great admirer of the political\r\n     education of the British people and of their fleet, and you\r\n     will have a just view of the tendency, tone, and contents of\r\n     the imperial letter to Lord Tweedmouth. His Majesty\r\n     consequently finds himself in this letter not only in full\r\n     agreement with the Chancellor--I may mention this specially\r\n     for the benefit of Herr Bebel--but, as I am convinced, in\r\n     agreement with the entire nation. It would be deeply\r\n     regrettable if the honourable opinions by which our Kaiser\r\n     was moved in writing this letter should be misconstrued in\r\n     England. With satisfaction I note that the attempts at such\r\n     misconstruction have been almost unanimously rejected in\r\n     England ('Bravo!' on the Right and Left). Above all,\r\n     gentlemen, I believe that the admirable way in which the\r\n     English Parliament has exemplarily treated the question will\r\n     have the best effect in preventing a disturbance of the\r\n     friendly relations between Germany and England and in\r\n     removing all hostile intention from the discussions over the\r\n     matter (agreement, Right and Left).\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, one more observation of a general nature.\r\n     Deputies von Hertling and Bassermann have recommended us, in\r\n     view of the suspicions spread about us abroad, a calm and\r\n     watchful attitude of reserve, and for the treatment of the\r\n     country's foreign affairs consistency, union, and firmness.\r\n     I believe that the foreign policy we must follow cannot be\r\n     characterized better or more rightly (applause).\"\r\n\r\nA German saying has it that one is wiser coming from, than going to,\r\nthe Rathaus, the place of counsel. It is easy to see now that it would\r\nhave been better had the Emperor not written the letter, better had\r\nthe _Times_ not brought it to public notice, better, also, had the\r\nEmperor or Lord Tweedmouth or Sir Edward Grey--for one of them must\r\nhave spoken of it to a third person--not let its existence become\r\nknown to anyone save themselves, at least not until the international\r\nsituation which prompted it had ceased. As regards the Emperor in\r\nparticular, judgment must be based on the answer to the question, Was\r\nthe letter a private letter or a public document? The _Times_ regarded\r\nit as the latter, and many politicians took that view, but probably\r\nnine people out of ten now regard it as the former. For such, the\r\nreflection that it was part of a private correspondence between two\r\nfriendly statesmen, both well known to be sincere in their views that\r\na country's navy--that all military preparations--are based on motives\r\nof national defence, not of high-handed aggression, must absolve the\r\nEmperor from any suspicion of political immorality. It was unfortunate\r\nthat the letter was written, unfortunate that it was made known\r\npublicly, but, as it is an ill wind that blows nobody good, the\r\nepisode may profit monarchs as well as meaner folk as an object lesson\r\nin the advantages of discretion.\r\n\r\nDiscussion of the Tweedmouth letter had hardly ceased when the whole\r\nquestion of the \"personal regiment\" was again, and as it now, five\r\nyears after, appears, finally thrashed out between the Emperor and his\r\nfolk. Before, however, considering the _Daily Telegraph_ interview and\r\nthe Emperor's part in it, something should be said as to the state of\r\ninternational ill-feeling which caused him to sanction its\r\npublication.\r\n\r\nThe ill-feeling was no sudden wave of hostility or pique, but a\r\nsentiment which had for years existed in the minds of both nations--a\r\nsentiment of mutual suspicion. The Englishman thought Germany was\r\nprepared to dispute with him the maritime supremacy of Great Britain,\r\nthe German that England intended to attack Germany before Germany\r\ncould carry her great design into execution. The proximate cause of\r\nthe irritation--for it has not yet got beyond that--was the decision,\r\nas announced in her Navy Law of 1898, to build a fleet of battleships\r\nwhich Germany, but especially the Emperor, considered necessary to\r\ncomplete the defences, and appropriate for affirming the dignity, of\r\nthe Empire.\r\n\r\nThis was the _origo_, but not the _fons_. The source was the Boer War\r\nand the Kruger telegram, though the philosophic historian might with\r\nsome reason refer it in a large measure also to the surprise and\r\nuneasiness with which the leading colonial and commercial, as well as\r\nmaritime, nation of the world saw the material progress, the waxing\r\nmilitary power, and the longing for expansion of the not yet\r\nforty-year-old German Empire. Forty years ago the word \"Germany\" had\r\nno territorial, but only a descriptive and poetical, significance;\r\ncertainly it had no political significance; for the North German\r\nUnion, out of which the modern German Empire grew, meant for\r\nEnglishmen, and indeed for politicians everywhere, only Prussia.\r\nPrussia was less liked by the world then than she is now, when she is\r\nnot liked too well; and accordingly there was already in existence the\r\ndisposition in England to criticize sharply the conduct of Prussia and\r\nto apply the same criticism to the Empire Prussia founded. In this\r\ncondition of international feeling England's long quarrel with the\r\nTransvaal Republic came nearer to the breaking-point; at the same time\r\nthere was an idea prevalent in England that Germany was coquetting\r\nwith the Boers--if not looking to a seizure of Transvaal territory, at\r\nleast hoping for Boer favour and Boer commercial privileges. The\r\nJameson Raid was made and failed; the Emperor and his advisers sent\r\nthe fateful telegram to President Kruger; and the peace of the world\r\nhas been in jeopardy ever since!\r\n\r\nThe \"storm\" arose from the publication, in the London _Daily\r\nTelegraph_ of October 28, 1908, of an interview coming, as the editor\r\nsaid in introducing it, \"from a source of such unimpeachable authority\r\nthat we can without hesitation commend the obvious message which it\r\nconveys to the attention of the public.\" As to the origin and\r\ncomposition of the interview a good deal of mystery still exists. All\r\nthat has become known is that some one, whose identity has hitherto\r\nsuccessfully been concealed, with the object of demonstrating the\r\nsentiments of warm friendship with which the Emperor regarded England,\r\nput together, in England or in Germany, a number of statements made by\r\nthe Emperor and sanctioned by him for publication. Whether the Emperor\r\nread the interview previous to publication or not, no official\r\nstatement has been made; it is, however, quite certain that he did. At\r\nall events it was sent, or sent back, to England and published in due\r\ncourse. The immediate effect was a hubbub of discussion, accompanied\r\nwith general astonishment in England, a storm of popular resentment\r\nand humiliation in Germany, and voluminous comment in other countries,\r\nsome of it favourable, some of it unfavourable, to the Emperor.\r\n\r\nThe text of the interview in the _Daily Telegraph_ was introduced, as\r\nmentioned, with the words:--\r\n\r\n     We have received the following communication from a source\r\n     of such unimpeachable authority that we can without\r\n     hesitation commend the obvious message which it conveys to\r\n     the attention of the public.\r\n\r\nAnd continued as follows:--\r\n\r\n     Discretion is the first and last quality requisite in a\r\n     diplomatist, and should still be observed by those who, like\r\n     myself, have long passed from public into private life. Yet\r\n     moments sometimes occur in the history of nations when a\r\n     calculated indiscretion proves of the highest public\r\n     service, and it is for that reason that I have decided to\r\n     make known the substance of a lengthy conversation which it\r\n     was my recent privilege to have with his Majesty the German\r\n     Emperor. I do so in the hope that it may help to remove that\r\n     obstinate misconception of the character of the Kaiser's\r\n     feelings towards England which, I fear, is deeply rooted in\r\n     the ordinary Englishman's breast. It is the Emperor's\r\n     sincere wish that it should be eradicated. He has given\r\n     repeated proofs of his desire by word and deed. But, to\r\n     speak frankly, his patience is sorely tried now that he\r\n     finds himself so continually misrepresented, and has so\r\n     often experienced the mortification of finding that any\r\n     momentary improvement of relations is followed by renewed\r\n     out-bursts of prejudice, and a prompt return to the old\r\n     attitude of suspicion.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, his Majesty honoured me with a long conversation, and\r\nspoke with impulsive and unusual frankness. \"You English,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"are mad, mad, mad as March hares. What has come over you\r\n     that you are so completely given over to suspicions quite\r\n     unworthy of a great nation? What more can I do than I have\r\n     done? I declared with all the emphasis at my command, in my\r\n     speech at Guildhall, that my heart is set upon peace, and\r\n     that it is one of my dearest wishes to live on the best of\r\n     terms with England. Have I ever been false to my word?\r\n     Falsehood and prevarication are alien to my nature. My\r\n     actions ought to speak for themselves, but you listen not to\r\n     them but to those who misinterpret and distort them. That is\r\n     a personal insult which I feel and resent. To be for ever\r\n     misjudged, to have my repeated offers of friendship weighed\r\n     and scrutinized with jealous, mistrustful eyes, taxes my\r\n     patience severely. I have said time after time that I am a\r\n     friend of England, and your Press--or, at least, a\r\n     considerable section of it--bids the people of England\r\n     refuse my proffered hand, and insinuates that the other\r\n     holds a dagger. How can I convince a nation against its\r\n     will?\"\r\n\r\n\"I repeat,\" continued his Majesty,\r\n\r\n     \"that I am the friend of England, but you make things\r\n     difficult for me. My task is not of the easiest. The\r\n     prevailing sentiment among large sections _of_ the middle\r\n     and lower classes of my own people is not friendly to\r\n     England. I am, therefore, so to speak, in a minority in my\r\n     own land, but it is a minority of the best elements, just as\r\n     it is in England with respect to Germany. That is another\r\n     reason why I resent your refusal to accept my pledged word\r\n     that I am the friend of England. I strive without ceasing to\r\n     improve relations, and you retort that I am your arch-enemy.\r\n     You make it very hard for me. Why is it?\"\r\n\r\nThereupon I ventured to remind his Majesty that not England alone, but\r\nthe whole of Europe had viewed with disapproval the recent action of\r\nGermany in allowing the German Consul to return from Tangier to Fez,\r\nand in anticipating the joint action of France and Spain by suggesting\r\nto the Powers that the time had come for Europe to recognize Muley\r\nHand as the new Sultan of Morocco.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty made a gesture of impatience. \"Yes,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"that is an excellent example of the way in which German\r\n     action is misrepresented. First, then, as regards the\r\n     journey of Dr. Vassel. The German Government, in sending Dr.\r\n     Vassel back to his post at Fez, was only guided by the wish\r\n     that he should look after the private interests of German\r\n     subjects in that city, who cried for help and protection\r\n     after the long absence of a Consular representative. And why\r\n     not send him? Are those who charge Germany with having\r\n     stolen a march on the other Powers aware that the French\r\n     Consular representative had already been in Fez for several\r\n     months when Dr. Vassel set out? Then, as to the recognition\r\n     of Muley I Hand. The Press of Europe has complained with\r\n     much acerbity that Germany ought not to have suggested his\r\n     recognition until he had notified to Europe his full\r\n     acceptance of the Act of Algeciras, as being binding upon\r\n     him as Sultan of Morocco and successor of his brother. My\r\n     answer is that Muley Hafid notified the Powers to that\r\n     effect weeks ago, before the decisive battle was fought. He\r\n     sent, as far back as the middle of last July, an identical\r\n     communication to the Governments of Germany, France, and\r\n     Great Britain, containing an explicit acknowledgment that he\r\n     was prepared to recognize all the obligations towards Europe\r\n     which were incurred by Abdul Aziz during his Sultanate. The\r\n     German Government interpreted that communication as a final\r\n     and authoritative expression of Muley Hand's intentions, and\r\n     therefore they considered that there was no reason to wait\r\n     until he had sent a second communication, before recognizing\r\n     him as the _de facto_ Sultan of Morocco, who had succeeded\r\n     to his brother's throne by right of victory in the field.\"\r\n\r\nI suggested to his Majesty that an important and influential section\r\nof the German Press had placed a very different interpretation upon\r\nthe action of the German Government, and, in fact, had given it their\r\neffusive approbation precisely because they saw in it a strong act\r\ninstead of mere words, and a decisive indication that Germany was once\r\nmore about to intervene in the shaping of events in Morocco. \"There\r\nare mischief-makers,\" replied the Emperor,\r\n\r\n     \"in both countries. I will not attempt to weigh their\r\n     relative capacity for misrepresentation. But the facts are\r\n     as I have stated. There has been nothing in Germany's recent\r\n     action with regard to Morocco which runs contrary to the\r\n     explicit declaration of my love of peace which I made both\r\n     at Guildhall and in my latest speech at Strassburg.\"\r\n\r\nHis Majesty then reverted to the subject uppermost in his mind--his\r\nproved friendship for England. \"I have referred,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"to the speeches in which I have done all that a sovereign\r\n     can to proclaim my goodwill. But, as actions speak louder\r\n     than words, let me also refer to my acts. It is commonly\r\n     believed in England that throughout the South African War\r\n     Germany was hostile to her. German opinion undoubtedly was\r\n     hostile--bitterly hostile. The Press was hostile; private\r\n     opinion was hostile. But what of official Germany? Let my\r\n     critics ask themselves what brought _to_ a sudden stop, and,\r\n     indeed, to absolute collapse, the European tour of the Boer\r\n     delegates who were striving to obtain European intervention?\r\n     They were feted in Holland; France gave them a rapturous\r\n     welcome. They wished to come to Berlin, where the German\r\n     people would have crowned them with flowers. But when they\r\n     asked me to receive them--I refused. The agitation\r\n     immediately died away, and the delegation returned\r\n     empty-handed. Was that, I ask, the action of a secret enemy?\r\n\r\n     \"Again, when the struggle was at its height, the German\r\n     Government was invited by the Governments of France and\r\n     Russia to join with them in calling upon England to put an\r\n     end to the war. The moment had come, they said, not only to\r\n     save the Boer Republics, but also to humiliate England to\r\n     the dust. What was my reply? I said that so far from Germany\r\n     joining in any concerted European action to put pressure\r\n     upon England and bring about her downfall, Germany would\r\n     always keep aloof from politics that could bring her into\r\n     complications with a Sea Power like England. Posterity will\r\n     one day read the exact terms of the telegram--now in the\r\n     archives of Windsor Castle--in which I informed the\r\n     Sovereign of England of the answer I had returned to the\r\n     Powers which then sought to compass her fall. Englishmen who\r\n     now insult me by doubting my word should know what were my\r\n     actions in the hour of their adversity.\r\n\r\n     \"Nor was that all. Just at the time of your Black Week, in\r\n     the December of 1899, when disasters followed one another in\r\n     rapid succession, I received a letter from Queen Victoria,\r\n     my revered grandmother, written in sorrow and affliction,\r\n     and bearing manifest traces of the anxieties which were\r\n     preying upon her mind and health. I at once returned a\r\n     sympathetic reply. Nay, I did more. I bade one of my\r\n     officers procure for me as exact an account as he could\r\n     obtain of the number of combatants in South Africa on both\r\n     sides, and of the actual position of the opposing forces.\r\n     With the figures before me, I worked out what I considered\r\n     to be the best plan of campaign under the circumstances, and\r\n     submitted it to my General Staff for their criticism. Then I\r\n     dispatched it to England, and that document, likewise, is\r\n     among the State papers at Windsor Castle, awaiting the\r\n     serenely impartial verdict of history. And, as a matter of\r\n     curious coincidence, let me add that the plan which I\r\n     formulated ran very much on the same lines as that which was\r\n     actually adopted by Lord Roberts, and carried by him into\r\n     successful operation. Was that, I repeat, the act of one who\r\n     wished England ill? Let Englishmen be just and say!\r\n\r\n     \"But, you will say, what of the German navy? Surely that is\r\n     a menace to England! Against whom but England are my\r\n     squadrons being prepared? If England is not in the minds of\r\n     those Germans who are bent on creating a powerful fleet, why\r\n     is Germany asked to consent to such new and heavy burdens of\r\n     taxation? My answer is clear. Germany is a young and growing\r\n     Empire. She has a world-wide commerce, which is rapidly\r\n     expanding, and to which the legitimate ambition of patriotic\r\n     Germans refuses to assign any bounds. Germany must have a\r\n     powerful fleet to protect that commerce, and her manifold\r\n     interests in even the most distant seas. She expects those\r\n     interests to go on growing, and she must be able to champion\r\n     them manfully in any quarter of the globe. Germany looks\r\n     ahead. Her horizons stretch far away. She must be prepared\r\n     for any eventualities in the Far East. Who can foresee what\r\n     may take place in the Pacific in the days to come--days not\r\n     so distant as some believe, but days, at any rate, for which\r\n     all European Powers with Far Eastern interests ought\r\n     steadily to prepare? Look at the accomplished rise of Japan;\r\n     think of the possible national awakening of China; and then\r\n     judge of the vast problems of the Pacific. Only those Powers\r\n     which have great navies will be listened to with respect\r\n     when the future of the Pacific comes to be solved; and if\r\n     for that reason only Germany must have a powerful fleet. It\r\n     may even be that England herself will be glad that Germany\r\n     has a fleet when they speak together on the same side in the\r\n     great debates of the future.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the purport of the Emperor's conversation. He spoke with all\r\nthat earnestness which marks his manner when speaking on deeply\r\npondered subjects. I would ask my fellow-countrymen who value the\r\ncause of peace to weigh what I have written, and to revise, if\r\nnecessary, their estimate of the Kaiser and his friendship for England\r\nby his Majesty's own words. If they had enjoyed the privilege, which\r\nwas mine, of hearing them spoken, they would doubt no longer either\r\nhis Majesty's firm desire to live on the best of terms with England or\r\nhis growing impatience at the persistent mistrust with which his offer\r\nof friendship is too often received.\r\n\r\nThere are more indiscretions than one in the interview, but the most\r\nimportant and most dangerous was the Emperor's statement that at the\r\ntime of the Boer War the Governments of France and Russia invited the\r\nGerman Government to join with them \"not only to save the Boer\r\nRepublics, but also to humiliate England to the dust.\" Such a\r\nrevelation coming from the Emperor ought, one would suppose, to have\r\ncaused serious trouble between Great Britain and her Entente friends.\r\nThat it did not is at once testimony to the cynicism of Governments\r\nand the reality and strength of the Entente engagement. In private\r\nlife, if a fourth person confidentially told one of the three partners\r\nin a firm that the other two partners had invited him to join them in\r\nhumiliating him to the dust, there would have been a pretty brisk, not\r\nto say acrimonious correspondence between the proposed victim and his\r\npartners. Governments, it appears, look on things differently, and so\r\nfar as the public knows, England simply took no notice of the\r\nEmperor's communication. Possibly, however, the Emperor had put the\r\nmatter too strongly and an explanation of some kind was forthcoming.\r\nIf so, it must be looked for among the secret archives of the Foreign\r\nOffice. It was at once suggested that the Emperor made the revelation\r\nexpressly to weaken, if not destroy, the Entente. One can conceive\r\nBismarck doing such a thing; but it is more in keeping with the\r\nEmperor's character, and with the indiscreet character of the entire\r\ninterview, to suppose it to be a proof of deplorable candour and\r\nsincerity.\r\n\r\nThe excitement in Germany caused by the publication of the interview\r\nsoon took the shape of a determination on the part of the Chancellor\r\nand the Federal Council, for once fully identifying themselves with\r\nthe feelings of Parliament, Press, and people, that \"something must be\r\ndone,\" and it was decided that the Chancellor should go to Potsdam,\r\nsee the Emperor, and try to obtain from him a promise to be more\r\ncautious in his utterances on political topics for the future. The\r\nChancellor went accordingly, being seen off from the railway terminus\r\nin Berlin by a large crowd of people, among whom were many\r\njournalists. To Dr. Paul Goldmann, who wished him God-speed, he could\r\nonly reply that he hoped all would be for the best. He looked pale and\r\ngrave, as well he might, since he was about to stake his own position\r\nas well as convey a mandate of national reproach.\r\n\r\nWhat passed at Potsdam between the Emperor and his Chancellor has not\r\ntranspired. Naturally there are various accounts of it, one of them\r\nrepresenting the Emperor as flying into a passion and for long\r\nrefusing to give the required guarantees; but as yet none of them has\r\nbeen authenticated. It should not be difficult to imagine the mental\r\nattitudes of the two men on the occasion, and especially not difficult\r\nto imagine the sensations of the Emperor, a Prussian King, on being\r\nimpeached by a people--his people--for whom, his feeling would be, he\r\nhad done so much, and in whose best interests he felt convinced he had\r\nacted; but whatever occurred, it ended in the Emperor bowing before\r\nthe storm and giving the assurances required.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor's countenance and expressions on his return to Berlin\r\nshowed that his mission had been successful, and there was great\r\nsatisfaction in the capital and country. The text of these assurances,\r\nwhich was published in the _Official Gazette_ the same evening, was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"His Majesty, while unaffected by public criticism which he\r\n     regards as exaggerated, considers his most honourable\r\n     imperial task to consist in securing the stability of the\r\n     policy of the Empire while adhering to the principle of\r\n     constitutional responsibility. The Kaiser accordingly\r\n     endorses the statements of the Imperial Chancellor in\r\n     Parliament, and assures Prince von Bülow of his continued\r\n     confidence.\"\r\n\r\nAfter returning to Berlin, Prince Bülow gave in the Reichstag his\r\nimpatiently awaited account of the result of his mission, and made\r\nwhat defence he could of his imperial master's action in allowing the\r\nfamous interview to be published. Before giving the speech, which was\r\ndelivered on November 10, 1908, it will be as well to quote the five\r\ninterpellations introduced in Parliament on the subject, as showing\r\nthe unanimity of feeling that existed in all parts of the House:--\r\n\r\n1. By Deputy Bassermann (leader of the National Liberals):\r\n\r\n     \"Is the Chancellor prepared to take constitutional\r\n     responsibility for the publication of a series of utterances\r\n     of his Majesty the Kaiser in the _Daily Telegraph_ and the\r\n     facts communicated therein?\"\r\n\r\n2. By Deputy Dr. Ablass (Progressive Party):\r\n\r\n     \"Through the publication of utterances of the German Kaiser\r\n     in the _Daily Telegraph_, and through the communication of\r\n     the real facts in the _Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung_\r\n     caused by the Chancellor, matters have become known which\r\n     demonstrate serious short-comings in the treatment of\r\n     foreign affairs, and are calculated to influence\r\n     unfavourably the relations of the German Empire to other\r\n     Powers. What does the Chancellor propose to do to devise a\r\n     remedy and to give full effect to the responsibility\r\n     attributed to him by the Constitution of the German Empire?\"\r\n\r\n3. By Deputy Albrecht (Socialist):\r\n\r\n     \"What is the Chancellor prepared to do to prevent such\r\n     occurrences as have become known through the _Daily\r\n     Telegraph's_ communications regarding acts and utterances of\r\n     the German Kaiser?\"\r\n\r\n4. By Deputy von Norman (Conservative Party):\r\n\r\n     \"Is the Chancellor prepared to submit further information\r\n     regarding the circumstances which led to the publication of\r\n     utterances of his Majesty the Kaiser in the English Press?\"\r\n\r\n5. By Prince von Hatzfeldt and Freiherr von Gamp (Imperial\r\nParty--Conservative):\r\n\r\n     \"Is the Chancellor willing to take precautions that such\r\n     occurrences as that brought to light by the publication in\r\n     the _Daily Telegraph_ shall not recur?\"\r\n\r\nIn reply to the interpellations Prince von Bülow said:--\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, I shall not apply myself to every point which\r\n     has just been raised by previous speakers. I have to\r\n     consider the effect of my words abroad, and will not add to\r\n     the great harm already caused by the publication in the\r\n     _Daily Telegraph_ (hear, hear, on the Left and Socialists).\r\n\r\n     \"In reply to the interpellations submitted, I have to\r\n     declare as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"His Majesty the Kaiser has at different times, and to\r\n     different private English personalities, made private\r\n     utterances which, linked together, have been published in\r\n     the _Daily Telegraph_. I must suppose that not all details\r\n     of the utterances have been correctly reproduced (hear,\r\n     hear, on the Right). One I know is not correct: that is the\r\n     story about the plan of campaign (hear, hear, on the right).\r\n     The plan in question was not a field campaign worked out in\r\n     detail, but a purely academic (laughter among the\r\n     Socialists)--Gentlemen, we are engaged in a serious\r\n     discussion. The matters on which I speak are of an earnest\r\n     kind and of great political importance--be good enough to\r\n     listen to me quietly: I will be as brief as possible. I\r\n     repeat therefore: the matter is not concerned with a field\r\n     campaign worked out in detail, but with certain purely\r\n     academic thoughts--I believe they were expressly described\r\n     as 'aphorisms'--about the conduct of war in general, which\r\n     the Kaiser communicated in his interchange of correspondence\r\n     with the late Queen Victoria. They are theoretical\r\n     observations of no practical moment for the course of\r\n     operations and the issue of the war. The chief of the\r\n     General Staff, General von Moltke, and his predecessor,\r\n     General Count Schlieffen, have declared that the General\r\n     Staff reported to the Kaiser on the Boer War as on every\r\n     war, great or small, which has occurred on the earth during\r\n     the last ten years. Both, however, have given assurances\r\n     that our General Staff never examined a field plan of\r\n     campaign, or anything similar, prepared by the Kaiser in\r\n     view of the Boer War, or forwarded such to England (hear,\r\n     hear, on the Right and Centre). But I must also defend our\r\n     policy against the reproach of being ambiguous _vis-à-vis_\r\n     the Boers. We had--the documents show it--given timely\r\n     warning to the Transvaal Government. We called its attention\r\n     to the fact that in case of a war with England it would\r\n     stand alone. We put it to her directly, and through the\r\n     friendly Dutch Government in May, 1899, peacefully to come\r\n     to an understanding with England, since there could be no\r\n     doubt as to the result of a war.\r\n\r\n     \"In the question of intervention the colours in the article\r\n     of the _Daily Telegraph_ are too thickly laid on. The thing\r\n     itself had long been known (hear, hear). It was some time\r\n     previously the subject of controversy between the _National\r\n     Review_ and the _Deutsche Revue_. There can be no talk of a\r\n     'revelation.' It was said that the imperial communication to\r\n     the Queen of England, that Germany had not paid any\r\n     attention to a suggestion for mediation or intervention, is\r\n     a breach of the rules of diplomatic intercourse. Gentlemen,\r\n     I will not recall indiscretions to memory, for they are\r\n     frequent in the diplomatic history of all nations and at all\r\n     times ('Quite right,' on the Right). The safest policy is\r\n     perhaps that which need fear no indiscretion ('Quite right,'\r\n     on the Left). To pass judgment in particular cases as to\r\n     whether or not a breach of confidence has occurred, one must\r\n     know more of the closely connected circumstances than\r\n     appears in the article of the _Daily Telegraph_. The\r\n     communication might be justified if it were attempted in one\r\n     quarter or another to misrepresent our refusal or to throw\r\n     suspicion on our attitude; circumstances may have previously\r\n     happened which make allusion to the subject in a\r\n     confidential correspondence at least intelligible.\r\n     Gentlemen, I said before that many of the expressions used\r\n     in the _Daily Telegraph_ article are too strong. That is\r\n     true, in the first place, of the passage where the Kaiser is\r\n     represented as having said that the majority of the German\r\n     people are inimically disposed towards England. Between\r\n     Germany and England misunderstandings have occurred,\r\n     serious, regrettable misunderstandings. But I am conscious\r\n     of being at one with this entire honourable House in the\r\n     view that the German people desire peaceful and friendly\r\n     relations with England on the basis of mutual esteem (loud\r\n     and general applause)--and I take note that the speakers of\r\n     all parties have spoken to-day in the same sense ('Quite\r\n     right'). The colours are also too thickly laid on in the\r\n     place where reference is made to our interests in the\r\n     Pacific Ocean. It has been construed in a sense hostile to\r\n     Japan. Wrongly: we have never in the Far East thought of\r\n     anything but this--to acquire and maintain for Germany a\r\n     share of the commerce of Eastern Asia in view of the great\r\n     economic future of this region. We are not thinking of\r\n     maritime adventure there: aggressive tendencies have as\r\n     little to say to our naval construction in the Pacific as in\r\n     Europe. Moreover, his Majesty the Kaiser entirely agrees\r\n     with the responsible director of foreign policy in the\r\n     complete recognition of the high political importance which\r\n     the Japanese people have achieved by their political\r\n     strength and military ability. German policy does not regard\r\n     it as its task to detract from the enjoyment and development\r\n     of what Japan has acquired.\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, I am, generally speaking, under the impression\r\n     that if the material facts--completely, in their proper\r\n     shape--were individually known, the sensation would be no\r\n     great one; in this instance, too, the whole is more than all\r\n     the parts taken together. But above all, gentlemen, one must\r\n     not, while considering the material things, quite forget the\r\n     psychology, the tendency. For two decades our Kaiser has\r\n     striven, often under very difficult circumstances, to bring\r\n     about friendly relations between Germany and England. This\r\n     honest endeavour has had to contend with obstacles which\r\n     would have discouraged many. The passionate partisanship of\r\n     our people for the Boers was humanly intelligible; feeling\r\n     for the weaker certainly appeals to the sympathy. But this\r\n     partisanship has led to unjustified, and often unmeasured,\r\n     attacks on England, and similarly unjust and hateful attacks\r\n     have been made against Germany from the side of the English.\r\n     Our aims were misconstrued, and hostile plans against\r\n     England were foisted on us which we had never thought of.\r\n     The Kaiser, rightly convinced that this state of things was\r\n     a calamity for both countries and a danger for the civilized\r\n     world, kept undeviatingly on the course he had adopted. The\r\n     Kaiser is particularly wronged by any doubt as to the purity\r\n     of his intentions, his ideal way of thinking, and his deep\r\n     love of country.\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, let us avoid anything that looks like\r\n     exaggerated seeking for foreign favour, anything that looks\r\n     like uncertainty or obsequiousness. But I understand that\r\n     the Kaiser, precisely because he was anxious to work\r\n     zealously and honestly for good relationship with England,\r\n     felt embittered at being ever the object of attacks casting\r\n     suspicion on his best motives. Has one not gone so far as to\r\n     attribute to his interest in the German fleet secret views\r\n     against vital English interests--views which are far from\r\n     him. And so in private conversation with English friends he\r\n     sought to bring the proof, by pointing to his conduct, that\r\n     in England he was misunderstood and wrongly judged.\r\n\r\n     \"Gentlemen, the perception that the publication of these\r\n     conversations in England has not had the effect the Kaiser\r\n     wished, and in our own country has caused profound agitation\r\n     and painful regret, will--this firm conviction I have\r\n     acquired during these anxious days--lead the Kaiser for the\r\n     future, in private conversation also, to maintain the\r\n     reserve that is equally indispensable in the interest of a\r\n     uniform policy and for the authority of the Crown ('Bravo!'\r\n     on the Right).\r\n\r\n     \"If it were not so, I could not, nor could my successor,\r\n     bear the responsibility ('Bravo!' on the Right and National\r\n     Liberals).\r\n\r\n     \"For the fault which occurred in dealing with the manuscript\r\n     I accept, as I have caused to be said in the _Norddeutsche\r\n     Allgemeine Zeitung_, entire responsibility. It also goes\r\n     against my personal feelings that officials who have done\r\n     their duty all their lives should be stamped as\r\n     transgressors because, in a single case, they relied too\r\n     much on the fact that I usually read and finally decide\r\n     everything myself.\r\n\r\n     \"With Herr von Heydebrand I regret that in the mechanism of\r\n     the Foreign Office, which for eleven years has worked\r\n     smoothly under me, a defect should on one occasion occur. I\r\n     will answer for it that such a thing does not happen again,\r\n     and that with this object, without respect to persons,\r\n     though also without injustice, what is needful will be done\r\n     ('Bravo!').\r\n\r\n     \"When the article in the _Daily Telegraph_ appeared, its\r\n     fateful effect could not for a moment be doubtful to me, and\r\n     I handed in my resignation. This decision was unavoidable,\r\n     and was not difficult to come to. The most serious and most\r\n     difficult decision which I ever took in my political life\r\n     was, in obedience to the Kaiser's wish, to remain in office.\r\n     I brought myself to this decision only because I saw in it a\r\n     command of my political duty, precisely in the time of\r\n     trouble, to continue to serve his Majesty the Kaiser and the\r\n     country (repeated 'Bravo!'). How long that will be possible\r\n     for me, I cannot say.\r\n\r\n     \"Let me say one thing more: at a moment when the fact that\r\n     in the world much is once again changing requires serious\r\n     attention to be given to the entire situation, wherever it\r\n     is matter of concern to maintain our position abroad, and\r\n     without pushing ourselves forward with quiet constancy to\r\n     make good our interests--at such a moment we ought not to\r\n     show ourselves small-spirited in foreign eyes, nor make out\r\n     of a misfortune a catastrophe. I will refrain from all\r\n     criticism of the exaggerations we have lived through during\r\n     these last days. The harm is--as calm reflection will\r\n     show--not so great that it cannot with circumspection be\r\n     made good. Certainly no one should forget the warning which\r\n     the events of these days has given us ('Bravo!')--but there\r\n     is no reason to lose our heads and awake in our opponents\r\n     the hope that the Empire, inwardly or outwardly, is maimed.\r\n\r\n     \"It is for the chosen representatives of the nation to\r\n     exhibit the prudence which the time demands. I do not say it\r\n     for myself, I say it for the country: the support required\r\n     for this is no favour, it is a duty which this honourable\r\n     House will not evade (loud applause on the Right, hisses\r\n     from the Socialists).\"\r\n\r\nPrince Bülow's speech requires but little comment--its importance for\r\nGermany is the fact that it brought to a head the country's feeling,\r\nthat if the Emperor's unlimited and unrestrained idea of his\r\nheaven-sent mission as sole arbiter of the nation's destinies was not\r\nchecked, disaster must ensue. The speech itself is rather an apology\r\nand an explanation than a defence, and in this spirit it was accepted\r\nin Germany. It is fair to say that the Emperor has faithfully kept the\r\nengagement made through Prince Bülow with his people so far, and\r\nunless human nature is incurable there seems no reason why he should\r\nnot keep it to the end of the reign. More than four years have passed\r\nsince the incidents narrated occurred. The storm has blown over, the\r\nsea of popular indignation has gone down, and at present no cloud is\r\nvisible on the horizon.\r\n\r\nBesides the Tweedmouth Letter and the \"November Storm\" there were one\r\nor two other notable events in the parliamentary proceedings of the\r\nyear. The Reichstag dealt with Prussian electoral reform and the\r\nattitude of Germany towards the question of disarmament. As to the\r\nfirst, the Government refused to regard it as an imperial concern,\r\nthough the popular claim was and is that the suffrage should be the\r\nsame in Prussia as in the Empire, viz., universal, direct, and secret.\r\nThis claim the Emperor will not listen to, on the ground that it would\r\ninjure the influence of the middle classes by the admission of\r\nundesirable elements (meaning the Socialists); that the electoral\r\nsystem for the Empire, with the latter's national tasks, should be on\r\na broader basis than in the case of the individual States, where the\r\nelectors are chiefly concerned with administration, the school, and\r\nthe Church; and that it would bring the Imperial and Prussian\r\nParliaments into conflict to the injury of German unity. The Emperor\r\nhas made only one reference to electoral reform in Prussia, a promise,\r\nnamely, he gave the Diet in October of this year, that the regulations\r\nconcerning the voting should experience\r\n\r\n     \"an organic further development, which should correspond to\r\n     the economic progress, the spread of education and political\r\n     understanding, and the strengthening of the feeling of State\r\n     responsibility.\"\r\n\r\nNo reform, however, has yet been effected by legislation.\r\n\r\nAs to disarmament, Germany's position is simply negative, though it\r\nmay be noticed by anticipation that she has recently (1913) expressed\r\nher disposition to accept the proportion of ten German to sixteen\r\nEnglish first-class battleships suggested by Sir Edward Grey in 1912\r\nas offering the basis of a possibly permanent arrangement. At the time\r\nnow dealt with, however, Chancellor von Bülow asserted that no\r\nproposal that could serve as a basis had ever been submitted to his\r\nGovernment, and added that even if such a proposal were made it was\r\ndoubtful if it could be accepted. It was not merely the number of\r\nships, he said, that was involved; there were a host of technical\r\nquestions--standards, criteria of all sorts, which could not be\r\nexpressed in figures, economic progress abroad and the possible effect\r\nof new scientific inventions--to be considered. Lastly there were the\r\nnavy laws, which the Government was pledged to carry out. As for\r\nmilitary disarmament, the Emperor and his advisers regard it as\r\nimpossible, considering the unfavourable strategic situation of\r\nGermany in the midst of Europe, with exposed frontiers on every side.\r\n\r\nThis year the Emperor and his family took up their quarters for the\r\nfirst time in their new Corfu spring residence \"Achilleion.\" They were\r\nmet by the Royal Family of Greece, who showed them over the Castle,\r\nand in the evening were welcomed by the mayor of Corfu, who, in a\r\nflight of metaphor, said his people desired to wreathe the Emperor's\r\n\"Olympic brow\" with a crown of olive. That the Emperor did not pass\r\nhis days wholly in admiring the beauty of the scenery was shown by the\r\nfact that a few days after his arrival he delivered a lecture in the\r\nCastle on \"Nelson and the Battle of Trafalgar,\" being prompted thereto\r\nby a book on the subject by Captain Mark Kerr, of H.M.S. _Implacable_.\r\nThe Emperor illustrated his lecture with sketches drawn by himself of\r\nthe positions of the united French and Spanish fleets during the\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nAlmost every year sees some specialty produced at the Royal Opera in\r\nBerlin. This year it was Meyerbeer's \"Les Huguenots,\" performed in the\r\npresence of the French Ambassador in Berlin, Monsieur Jules Cambon,\r\nand two directors of the Paris Opera. The Emperor told Monsieur\r\nMessager, one of the latter, that he had taken an infinity of trouble\r\nto get the right character, colour, and movement of the period of the\r\nopera, and explained his interest in the work by the fact that he had\r\nlost two of his ancestors, Admiral Coligny and the Prince of Orange,\r\nin the historic massacre. This opera, with Verdi's \"Aida,\" are still,\r\nas given at the Royal Opera, the favourite operas of the Berlin\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nAmericans, like all other people, regard the Emperor with friendly\r\nfeelings, but for a time this year their respect for him suffered some\r\ndiminution owing to what was known as the Tower-Hill affair. When the\r\nAmerican Ambassador in Berlin, Mr. Charlemagne Tower, resigned his\r\npost in 1908, the Washington authorities found difficulty in choosing\r\na suitable successor. Mr. Tower was a wealthy man, who by his personal\r\nqualities, aided by a talented wife, whom the Emperor once described\r\nas \"the Moltke of society,\" and by frequent entertainments in one of\r\nthe finest houses of the fashionable Tiergarten quarter, had fully\r\nsatisfied the Emperor of his fitness to represent a great nation at\r\nthe Court of a great Empire. The Emperor has a high opinion of his\r\ncountry, and, in small things as in great, will not have it treated as\r\na _quantité négligeable_: consequently a millionaire was not too good\r\nfor Berlin. The impression produced by Mr. Tower on Republican America\r\nwas not quite the same. When Ambassador in St. Petersburg, Mr. Tower\r\nhad invented a Court uniform for himself and staff of a highly ornate,\r\nnot to say fantastic, kind, and when in Berlin was thought to take too\r\nlittle trouble to win popularity among his American fellow-colonists.\r\nThis non-republican attitude, as it seemed to be, met with a good deal\r\nof adverse criticism in America, and the Washington authorities, for\r\nthat or for some other reason, considered it advisable to choose as\r\nMr. Tower's successor a man of another type. Their choice fell on Dr.\r\nDavid Jayne Hill, American Minister at Berne, a former President of\r\nRochester University, the author of a standard work on the History of\r\nDiplomacy, and as renowned for the amiability of his character as for\r\nhis academic attainments. A further reason for choosing him was that\r\nhe had been attached to the service of the Emperor's brother, Prince\r\nHenry, during the latter's visit to the United States some years\r\nbefore. Dr. Hill spoke German excellently, was able and distinguished,\r\nand, if not a man of great means, was sufficiently well-to-do to\r\nrepresent his country becomingly at the Court of Berlin. His selection\r\nwas in due course communicated for _agrément_ to the German Foreign\r\nOffice, and by it, also in due course, transmitted to the Emperor. The\r\nEmperor without more ado signed the _agrément_ and the arrival of Dr.\r\nHill in Berlin was daily expected.\r\n\r\nJust at this time, however, Mr. Tower gave a farewell dinner to the\r\nEmperor, and invited to it specially from Rome the American Ambassador\r\nto Italy, Mr. Griscom. Mr. Griscom was accompanied by his clever and\r\nattractive wife. The dinner-party assembled, and Mr. Griscom and his\r\nwife were placed in the immediate neighbourhood of the Emperor. Before\r\ndinner was over it was evident that the Griscoms had made a most\r\nfavourable impression on the imperial guest. Accordingly, so the story\r\ngoes, when towards the end of dinner the Emperor, in his impulsive\r\nway, exclaimed, \"Now, why didn't America send me the Griscoms instead\r\nof the Hills?\" or words to that effect, the company was not completely\r\ntaken by surprise. When, however, the Emperor went on to suggest to\r\nhis host to telegraph to President Roosevelt to make the change, it\r\nbecame evident that an international incident of exceptional delicacy\r\nhad been created. Mr. Tower, who would perhaps have acted with better\r\njudgment had he declined to adopt the Emperor's suggestion, cabled to\r\nPresident Roosevelt, and at the same Mr. Griscom wrote to him\r\nprivately. Before Mr. Griscom's letter arrived, perhaps before Mr.\r\nRoosevelt was in possession of Mr. Tower's telegram, the words of the\r\nEmperor had become known in Berlin, were cabled to the American Press,\r\nand much indignation at the Emperor's conduct was aroused in all parts\r\nof America. The two Governments, as well as Dr. Hill, were placed in a\r\nposition of great embarrassment. In view of the state of public\r\nopinion in America, and in view also of the American Government's\r\nengagement _vis à vis_ Dr. Hill, the Washington authorities could not\r\nwithdraw a nominee who had been already signalled to it from Germany\r\nas _persona grata_. The only way possible out of the difficulty was to\r\nemploy the machinery of the official _démenti_, and this was\r\naccordingly done. It was denied by the Foreign Office that the Emperor\r\nhad expressed dissatisfaction with Dr. Hill's appointment, and the\r\nincident closed with the carrying out of the original arrangements and\r\nthe arrival of Dr. Hill in Berlin. Subsequent events proved that had\r\nthe Emperor known Dr. Hill personally he would never have thought of\r\nexpressing dissatisfaction at the prospect of seeing him as Ambassador\r\nat his Court, for Dr. Hill, during the two years of his stay, fully\r\nvindicated the wisdom of the Washington Government's choice, and\r\nbefore he left his post had earned the Emperor's complete respect, if\r\nnot his cordial friendship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER THE STORM\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1909-1913\r\n\r\nNext year, 1909, was the year of the famous finance reform measure\r\nwhich, though finally carried through, led to the resignation of\r\nChancellor von Bülow. It had been obvious for some years that a\r\nreorganization of the imperial system of finance with a view to\r\nmeeting the growing expenses of the Empire, and in especial those of\r\nthe army and navy, was necessary if imperial bankruptcy was to be\r\navoided. The practice of taking what were known as matricular\r\ncontributions from the separate States to make up for deficits in the\r\nimperial budgets, and of burdening posterity by State loans, had one\r\nday to cease. At the beginning of the reign the National Debt was 884\r\nmillion marks (£44,200,000), and in 1908 over 4,000 million marks\r\n(£200,000,000). A year before this Prince Bülow had made his first\r\nproposals for reform, including new taxes on beer, wine, tobacco, and\r\nsuccession duties on property.\r\n\r\nAll parties in Parliament, except of course the Social Democrats,\r\nadmitted that fresh imposts were inevitable, but, very naturally, no\r\nparty was willing to bear them. The Conservatives would not hear of an\r\ninheritance tax and the Liberals would not hear of duties on popular\r\nconsumption. The result was to make the Centrum masters of the\r\npolitical field and place the Conservative-Liberal \"bloc\" at its\r\nmercy. After long discussion, the Government proposals were put to the\r\nvote on June 24th, and as the Centrum threw in its lot with the\r\nConservatives, the proposals were rejected by 195 votes to 187. Prince\r\nBülow thereupon went to Kiel and tendered his resignation to the\r\nEmperor, but at the latter's urgent request consented to remain in\r\noffice until financial reform in one shape or another had been\r\neffected. This result was attained a month later, after much\r\ncompromising and discussion. The Chancellor renewed his request for\r\nretirement, and the Emperor agreed. On the same day, July 14th, that\r\nthe resignation took effect, it was officially announced that Herr von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, who had hitherto been Minister of the Interior, was\r\nappointed to succeed Prince von Bülow as Imperial Chancellor.\r\n\r\nAn impression prevails widely in Germany that Prince Bülow's\r\nretirement was due to the loss of the Emperor's favour owing to the\r\nPrince's attitude towards the monarch during the \"November storm.\"\r\nPrince Bülow, very properly, has always refused to say anything about\r\nhis relations with his royal master, but a lengthy statement he made\r\nto a newspaper correspondent referring his resignation to the conduct\r\nof the Conservatives, and a letter from the Emperor gratefully\r\nthanking the Prince in the warmest terms for his \"long and intimate\r\nco-operation,\" and conferring upon him at the same time the highest\r\nOrder in the Empire, that of the Black Eagle, should be sufficient\r\nevidence to disprove the supposition. It is more probable that the\r\nPrince was weary of the cares of office and of the strife of party.\r\nMoreover, he had, in the state of his health, a strong private reason\r\nfor retirement. Four years before, on April 5, 1906, he had fallen\r\nunconscious from his seat on the ministerial bench during the\r\nproceedings in the Reichstag, and although he was back again in\r\nParliament, perfectly recovered, in the following November, the attack\r\nwas an experience which warned him against too great a prolongation of\r\nsuch heavy work and responsibility as the Chancellorship entails.\r\n\r\nThe retirement of Prince Bülow meant the disappearance of the most\r\nnotable figure in German political life since the beginning of the\r\ncentury. In ability, wit, and those graces of a refined and richly\r\ncultivated mind which have so often distinguished great English\r\nstatesmen, he was a head and shoulders above any of his\r\nfellow-countrymen; while the mere fact that he was able to maintain\r\nhis position for almost twelve years (he had been, as Foreign\r\nSecretary for over two years, the Emperor's most trusted counsellor\r\nand the real executive in foreign policy) is a convincing proof of his\r\ntact and diplomatic talent, as well as of his statesmanship.\r\n\r\nHis successor, the present Chancellor, Herr von Bethmann-Hollweg, is a\r\nman of another and very different type. He incorporates the spirit of\r\nPrussian patriotism of the most orthodox kind in its worthiest and\r\nbest manifestations, but as yet he has given no proofs of possessing\r\nthe breadth of view, the oratorical talent, or the urbanity which\r\ndistinguished his predecessor. Prince von Bülow's career as a German\r\ndiplomatist in foreign capitals made him an acute and highly polished\r\nman of the world. The present Chancellor has spent all his life within\r\nthe comparatively narrow confines of Prussian administrative service.\r\nIt is, of course, too soon to pass final judgment on him as German\r\nPrime Minister.\r\n\r\nThe visit of King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra to Berlin in\r\nFebruary, 1909, disposed finally of the idea, which had prevailed in\r\nGermany as well as abroad for two or three years, that England was\r\npursuing a policy aiming to bring about the \"isolation\" of Germany in\r\nworld-politics. The visit was an official one, paid, of course,\r\nchiefly to the Emperor; but its most remarkable feature politics\r\napart, was the friendly relations which King Edward established with\r\nthe Berlin City Fathers at a reception in the Town Hall. It was not\r\nthat he said anything out of the way to the assembled burghers; but\r\nhis simple manner, genial remarks, and perhaps especially the\r\nsympathetic way in which he handled the loving-cup offered by his\r\nhosts, made an instantaneous and strong impression.\r\n\r\nThe controversy that raged round the so-called \"Flora Bust\"\r\ncontributed not a little to the gaiety of nations towards the close of\r\nthis year. The bust, an undraped wax figure, reproducing the features\r\nof Leonardo da Vinci's famous \"La Joconde,\" was bought by Dr. Wilhelm\r\nBode, Director of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Berlin, for £8,000\r\nfrom a London dealer as an authentic work of the celebrated Italian\r\npainter, dating from about the year 1500. It was brought with a great\r\nflourish of trumpets to Berlin, and a chorus of self-congratulation\r\nwas raised in Germany on the successful carrying off of such a prize\r\nfrom England. The harmony, however, was rudely disturbed by the\r\npublication of a letter from Mr. F.C. Cooksey, art critic of the\r\n_Times_, stating that the bust was not by da Vinci at all, but was in\r\nreality the work of Mr. R.C. Lucas, an artist of some note forty or\r\nfifty years ago, and that it had for long occupied a pedestal in\r\nLucas's suburban garden.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, whose curiosity as well as patriotism was aroused, spent\r\nhalf an hour on November 11th discussing the bust with Dr. Bode and\r\nexamining an album containing photographs of the works of Lucas. At\r\nthe close of his inspection the Emperor expressed great delight at the\r\nacquisition, as to the genuineness of which he declared he \"had not\r\nthe slightest doubt,\" and said he did not regard the price paid as\r\nextremely high. Unfortunately for the Emperor's conviction, a letter\r\nnow appeared in the _Times_ from Mr. A.C. Lucas, a son of R.C. Lucas,\r\nwho said he recollected the making of the bust, and suggested that\r\nthere might be found in its interior a piece of cloth, probably a part\r\nof an old waistcoat of his father's, which had been used as a sort of\r\nfilling. In the presence of such a statement there was only one thing\r\nleft to be done: to examine the interior of the bust. First of all it\r\nwas subjected to the Roentgen rays, the result being to show that the\r\ninterior was not homogeneous. A few days after, there was a great\r\ngathering of experts at the Museum, a hole was cut in the wax at the\r\nback of the bust, a bent wire was introduced, and the search for the\r\nfamous piece of waistcoat began. It was a dramatic moment as Professor\r\nLatghen with his wire explored the interior of the bust, and the\r\ntension reached its highest point when the Professor, drawing from the\r\nbust what was evidently a piece of cloth, exclaimed, \"_Hier ist die\r\nVeste!_\" On being further withdrawn the substance proved to be about\r\ntwo square inches of a grey, canvas-like material, feeling soft and\r\nvelvety to the touch. It was a disagreeable discovery for the Germans,\r\nbut it was got over by the suggestion that the original bust had been\r\nentrusted to Lucas for repair, and that in this way the waistcoat had\r\ngot into it. The \"poor English newspapers,\" Dr. Bode said, referring\r\nto the sarcastic comments on the discovery from the other side of the\r\nChannel, \"had had, without any acquaintance with our bust or with the\r\nwork of its alleged forger, to give this particular form of expression\r\nto their ill-humour at the sale.\" As a matter of fact, the bust,\r\nwhoever made it, is a lovely work of art, as every one who has seen it\r\nreadily admits.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's friendship with Mr. Theodore Roosevelt, which was now to\r\nbe confirmed by personal acquaintance, throws a side light on his own\r\ncharacter, and testifies to his desire to keep in touch with the\r\nrulers of other countries--another illustration, by the way, of his\r\nconsistency, since he laid down the policy of cultivating friendly\r\nrelations with foreign rulers at the very commencement of his reign.\r\nProbably many letters in the large characteristic handwriting of both\r\nmen have passed between them, and there probably always existed a\r\ndesire on the part of the wielder of the mailed fist to make the\r\npersonal acquaintance of the advocate of the big stick. The meeting\r\noccurred in May, 1910, after Mr. Roosevelt had shot wild beasts in\r\nAfrica, visited Egypt, London, Vienna, Rome, and other continental\r\ncities, with a cohort of newspaper correspondents, and caused by his\r\nspeeches political, if fortunately harmless, disturbance almost\r\neverywhere he went. When in Berlin he was to have lodged at the\r\nEmperor's palace; but the Emperor's hospitable intent was frustrated\r\nby the death of King Edward VII, which prevented all entertainment in\r\nthe home of his German nephew.\r\n\r\nThe Roosevelt party, consisting of the ex-President, Mrs. Roosevelt,\r\nand Miss Ethel Roosevelt, arrived in Berlin on May 11th from\r\nStockholm, and at noon the same day were taken by royal train to\r\nPotsdam. At the New Palace the party were heartily greeted by the\r\nEmperor, whom they found standing on the steps waiting to receive\r\nthem. After shaking hands the Emperor led his guests into a small\r\nreception-room, where they were introduced to the Empress, the Crown\r\nPrince and Crown Princess, and other members of the imperial family.\r\nThe Emperor then took them to the Shell Room, so called from its being\r\ninlaid with shells and rare stones, and here were found some of the\r\nEmperor's high officials, including Admiral von Müller, chief of the\r\nMarine Cabinet, and one of the most able and amiable of the Emperor's\r\nentourage, who had met Mr. Roosevelt when on his trip to America with\r\nPrince Henry several years before. Luncheon followed at six small\r\ntables in the Jasper Gallery, the Emperor taking his seat between Mrs.\r\nRoosevelt and the Crown Princess, while the Empress had Mr. Roosevelt\r\non her left and her eldest son, the Crown Prince, on her right.\r\nPrincess Victoria Louise, the Emperor's only daughter, occupied a seat\r\non Mr. Roosevelt's left. After lunch was over the guests went back to\r\nthe Shell Room, and here the Emperor, taking Mr. Roosevelt apart,\r\nbegan a conversation so long and animated that the shades of evening\r\nbegan to fall before it ended. The Roosevelts did not return to Berlin\r\nby train, but were first driven by the Emperor to inspect Sans Souci,\r\nand were afterwards whirled back to Berlin in the yellow imperial\r\nmotors.\r\n\r\nOnly two other incidents of the visit need be mentioned. One of them\r\nwas a lecture on \"The World Movement,\" delivered by Mr. Roosevelt in\r\nvery husky tones (for he was suffering badly from hoarseness) at\r\nBerlin University, in the presence of the Emperor and Empress. The\r\nother was a parade of 12,000 troops, arranged by the Emperor at\r\nDoeberitz, the great military exercise camp near Potsdam, which Mr.\r\nRoosevelt, clad in a khaki coat and breeches, and wearing brown\r\nleather gaiters and black slouch hat, observed from horseback beside\r\nthe Emperor. As the troops went by at the close of the review the\r\nEmperor and Mr. Roosevelt saluted in military fashion simultaneously.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the visit of the Roosevelts, the Emperor was called\r\nto England to attend the funeral of King Edward VII. The imperial\r\nyacht _Hohenzollern_, with the Emperor on board, arrived in England on\r\nMay 19th. Next day the Emperor travelled to Victoria terminus, where\r\nhe was received and warmly embraced by King George. They proceeded to\r\nBuckingham Palace, where the Emperor's first call was made on the\r\nwidowed Queen Alexandra. On the 21st took place the funeral of King\r\nEdward, the procession to Westminster Abbey, where the service was\r\nheld, being headed by King George with the Emperor on his right and\r\nthe Duke of Connaught on his left. Both the Emperor and the Duke were\r\ndressed in Field-Marshal's uniform and carried the bâtons of their\r\nrank. The countenance of the Emperor is described by a chronicler of\r\nthe time (and the _Times_) as wearing \"an expression grave even to\r\nseverity.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession moved slowly on to the famous Abbey, the Emperor riding\r\na grey horse, saluting at intervals as he rode along. On arrival at\r\nthe Abbey an incident occurred. As soon as Queen Alexandra's carriage\r\narrived and drew up, the Emperor, according to the accounts of\r\neyewitnesses, ran to the door of the carriage with so much alacrity\r\nthat he had reached it before the royal servants, and when it appeared\r\nthat her Majesty was not to alight from that side of the carriage, the\r\nEmperor motioned the lacqueys round to the other door, and was there\r\nbefore them to assist her Majesty. This he did, after himself opening\r\nthe door. The Emperor remained in England only a very few days after\r\nthe funeral, seeing old friends, among them Lord Kitchener.\r\n\r\nAs of interest to both Englishmen and Germans may be mentioned the\r\ntour through India undertaken by the Crown Prince in November. Steele\r\nonce happily said of a Lady Hastings that \"to love her was a liberal\r\neducation\"; to make a tour through India, it might similarly be said,\r\nis an education in the extent and character of British imperial power\r\nand administration. The Crown Prince naturally devoted a goodly share\r\nof his time to the delights of sport, including tiger-shooting and\r\npig-sticking, but he must also have learned much of England's fine\r\nimperial spirit from his intercourse with an official hierarchy as\r\nhonest and conscientious as that of his own country. The Crown Prince,\r\non his return home, published a volume of hunting reminiscences which\r\ndoes no small credit to him as an author.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's \"shining armour\" political remark dates from this\r\nperiod. He was on a visit to his Triplice ally, Kaiser Franz Josef, in\r\nSeptember, 1910, and made a speech at the Vienna Town Hall on the 21st\r\nwhich contained a reference to the loyal conduct he claimed Germany\r\nhad observed when the action of Austria-Hungary in annexing Bosnia and\r\nHerzegovina, despite the wording of the Treaty of Berlin, had raised\r\nan outcry in other countries, and in particular strained Austrian\r\nrelations with Russia. After thanking his audience for the personal\r\nreception given him, he continued:\r\n\r\n     \"On the other hand, it seems to me I read in your resolution\r\n     the agreement of the city of Vienna with the action of an\r\n     ally in taking his stand in shining armour at a grave moment\r\n     by the side of your most gracious sovereign.\"\r\n\r\nThe outcry caused in the world by Austria's high-handed annexation,\r\nand especially in Russia, theoretically always Austria's most probable\r\nenemy, owing to conflicting interests in the Balkans, subsided, we\r\nknow, as suddenly as it was raised. The reason, it is currently\r\nbelieved, and the form in which the rays of the shining armour acted,\r\nwas an intimation from the Emperor to the Czar that, if necessary,\r\nGermany was prepared to fight for Austria.\r\n\r\nPeoples are said to have the institutions, and husbands the wives,\r\nthey deserve; but if German cities, and especially Berlin, have the\r\npolice they deserve, the fact speaks very uncomplimentarily for their\r\ninhabitants. Foreigners in Germany, coming from countries where\r\nmanners are more natural and obliging, frequently use the adjectives\r\n\"brutal\" and \"stupid\" when speaking of the Prussian constable. The\r\nproceedings of the Berlin police during the Moabit riots in the\r\ncapital in September this year are often quoted as an example of their\r\nbrutality, while, as to stupidity, it is enough to say that a stranger\r\nin Berlin, discussing its mounted police, naïvely remarked that what\r\nmost struck him about them was the look of intelligence on the faces\r\nof the horses. Judgments of this kind are too sweeping. It should be\r\nremembered that Germany is surrounded by countries of which the\r\nriff-raff is at all times seeking refuge in it or passing through it,\r\nthat polyglot swindlers of every kind, the most refined as well as the\r\nmost commonplace, abound, and that Anarchists are not yet an extinct\r\nspecies. For the Prussian police, moreover, there is a Social Democrat\r\nbehind every bush.\r\n\r\nPossibly to this condition of things, and to the suspicion that Social\r\nDemocratic organizers were about, was due the gallant charge made by\r\nhalf a dozen policemen, with drawn swords in their hands and revolvers\r\nat their belts, on four inoffensive English and American journalists\r\nduring the Moabit riots. Towards midnight of September 29th the\r\njournalists were seated in an open taximeter cab, in a brilliantly\r\nlighted square, which some little time before had been swept of\r\nrioters--rioters from the Berlin police point of view being any one,\r\nman, woman, or child, who is, with guilty or innocent intent, it makes\r\nno difference, in or near a theatre of disturbance. Suddenly half a\r\ndozen burly policemen, led on by a police spy, as he afterwards turned\r\nout to be, charged the cab and laid about them with their swords. They\r\nprobably only intended to use the flat of their weapons, but one of\r\nthem succeeded in slashing deeply the hand of Reuter's representative,\r\nwho was of the party. The other journalists escaped with contusions\r\nand bruises, thanks chiefly to the sides of the cab impeding the\r\nsword-play of the attackers.\r\n\r\nThe journalists naturally complained to their Ambassadors, who took up\r\ntheir cause with commendable readiness. Without immediate effect,\r\nhowever; the authorities, though themselves very strong on the point\r\nof duty, wondered much at journalists being in a place where duty\r\nalone could have brought them, and refused any sort of apology or\r\nother satisfaction. The Government, however, eventually expressed its\r\n\"regret,\" and a year or two after, possibly in the spirit of\r\nconciliation and compensation, agreed to give foreign journalists in\r\nBerlin the _passe-partout_, or _coupe-fil_, as it is known in France,\r\nwhich is one of the privileges most valued by the journalist, native\r\nand foreign, in Paris.\r\n\r\nAmong the international agreements of the year was a commercial one\r\nbetween Germany and America. Commercial relations between the two\r\ncountries have never been quite satisfactory to either, and if there\r\nis no tariff war, occasions of tariff tension, with consequent\r\ndisturbance of trade, constantly arise. Germany's European commercial\r\ntreaties have secured her a sufficiency of raw material for her\r\nindustry. Her chief object now is not so much perhaps to facilitate\r\nimports of material from other countries as to find markets, in\r\nAmerica as elsewhere, for her industry's finished products.\r\nConsequently she strongly dislikes the high tariff barriers of the\r\nUnited States, inaugurated by the Dingley tariff of 1897, and has in\r\naddition certain grievances against that country regarding customs\r\nadministration in respect of appraisement, invoices, and the like. Her\r\ncommercial connexion with America dates from the treaty of \"friendship\r\nand commerce\" made by Frederick the Great, and having the\r\nmost-favoured-nation treatment as its basis; a regular treaty of the\r\nsame kind between Prussia and America was entered into in 1828; and\r\nsince then commercial relations have been regulated provisionally by a\r\nseries of short-term agreements which, however, America claims, do not\r\nconfer on Germany unrestricted right to most-favoured-nation\r\ntreatment. By the agreement now in force, concluded this year (1910),\r\nAmerica and Germany grant each other the benefit of their minimum\r\nduties.\r\n\r\nSince the \"November storm\" the Emperor had made no reference to the\r\ndoctrine of Divine Right, nor given any indication of a desire to\r\nexercise the \"personal regiment\" which is the natural corollary to it.\r\nIt has been seen that the doctrine, viewed from the English\r\nstandpoint, is a species of mental malady to which Hohenzollern\r\nmonarchs are hereditarily subject. It recurs intermittently and\r\nparticularly whenever a Hohenzollern monarch speaks in Koenigsberg,\r\nthe Scone of Prussia, where Prussian Kings are crowned. When at\r\nKoenigsberg this year the Emperor suffered from a return of the royal\r\n_idée fixe_. \"Here my grandfather,\" he said,\r\n\r\n     \"placed, by his own right, the crown of the Kings of Prussia\r\n     on his head, once again laying stress upon the fact that it\r\n     was conferred upon him by the Grace of God alone, not by\r\n     Parliament, by meetings of the people, or by popular\r\n     decisions; and that he considered himself the chosen\r\n     instrument of Heaven and as such performed his duties as\r\n     regent and as ruler.\"\r\n\r\nSpeaking of himself on the occasion he said:\r\n\r\n     \"Considering myself as an Instrument of the Lord, without\r\n     being misled by the views and opinions of the day, I go my\r\n     way, which is devoted solely and alone to the prosperity and\r\n     peaceful development of our Fatherland.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor, by the way, on this occasion made what sounds like an\r\nindirect reference to the Suffragette craze. \"What shall our women,\"\r\nhe asked, after mentioning the pattern Queen of Prussia, Queen Louise,\r\n\r\n     \"learn from the Queen? They must learn that the principal\r\n     task of the German woman does not lie in attending public\r\n     meetings and belonging to societies, in the attainment of\r\n     supposed rights in which women can emulate men, but in the\r\n     quiet work of the home and in the family.\"\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's reference to his divine appointment did not pass without\r\na good deal of popular criticism in Germany, but nearly all Germans\r\nwere at one with the Emperor in his view of the proper sphere for\r\nwomanly activities.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's domestic life for the last two or three years, including\r\nthe early months of the present year, have passed without special\r\ncause of interest or excitement, if we except the visit he and the\r\nEmpress made to London in May, 1911, to be present at the unveiling of\r\nQueen Victoria's statue, and the announcement he was able to make a\r\nfew months ago that his only daughter, Princess Victoria Louise, had\r\nbecome engaged to Prince Ernest August, Duke of Cumberland, the still\r\npersisting claimant to the Kingdom of Hannover, absorbed by Prussia in\r\n1866. The visit to London lasted only five days and produced no\r\nincident particularly worthy of record. The engagement of Princess\r\nVictoria Louise, while generally believed to be a love-match,\r\npossesses also political significance for Germany, not indeed as\r\nputting an end to the claim of the Duke of Cumberland, but as\r\npractically effecting a reconciliation between the Hohenzollerns and\r\nGuelphs. The young Duke of Brunswick had already implicitly renounced\r\nhis claim to Hannover by entering the German army and taking the oath\r\nof allegiance to the Emperor as War Lord, so that, when his father\r\ndies, the Guelph claim to Hannover will die with him.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to determine whether the Government's abandonment of\r\nits design to amend the Prussian franchise system in 1910, its\r\nsubmissive attitude towards the Pope's Borromeo Encyclical in 1911,\r\nthe rapid rise in food prices which marked both years, or finally, the\r\nEmperor's failure to secure a slice of Morocco for Germany had most\r\nantagonizing effect on German popular feeling; but whatever the cause,\r\nthe general elections of January, 1912, proved a tremendous Socialist\r\nvictory, which must have been, and still remains, gall and wormwood to\r\nthe Emperor. Notwithstanding official efforts, over one-third of the\r\nvotes polled at the first ballots went for Social Democratic\r\ncandidates. The number of seats thus obtained was 64, and this number,\r\nafter the second ballots, rose to 110, thus making the Socialist party\r\nnumerically the strongest in the Reichstag. Up to the present,\r\nhowever, Herr Bebel and his cohorts appear to be happy in possessing\r\npower rather than in using it.\r\n\r\nBefore completing the Emperor's domestic chronicle of more recent\r\nyears, a few lines may be devoted to the role in which he has last\r\nappeared before the public--that of farmer. On February 12, 1913, he\r\nattended a meeting of the German Agricultural Council in Berlin, and\r\nwith only a few statistical notes to help him narrated in lively and\r\namusing fashion his experiences as owner of a farm, the management of\r\nwhich he has been personally supervising since 1898. The farm is part\r\nof the Cadinen Estate, bequeathed to him by an admirer and universally\r\nknown for the majolica ware made out of the clay found on the\r\nproperty. The Emperor was able to show that he had achieved remarkable\r\nsuccess with his farm, and particularly with a fine species of bull,\r\n_Bos indicus major_, he maintained on it. A year or two before, at a\r\nsimilar meeting, when speaking of the same breed of bull, he caused\r\nmuch hilarity among the military portion of his audience by jokingly\r\nremarking that it had \"nothing to do with the General Staff.\" On the\r\npresent occasion he also caused laughter by recounting how he had\r\n\"fired,\" to use an American expression exactly equivalent to the\r\nGerman word employed by the Emperor, a tenant who \"wasn't any use.\"\r\nThe Emperor, however, would, as it turned out, have done better by not\r\nmentioning the incident, for the Supreme Court at Leipzig a few days\r\nsubsequently quashed the Emperor's order of ejectment on the tenant\r\nand condemned him to pay all the costs in the case. The role of\r\nfarmer, it may be added, is one which, had he been born a country\r\ngentleman like Bismarck, the Emperor would have filled with complete\r\nsuccess. But in what role would he not have done well?\r\n\r\nForeign politics everywhere for the last three or four years have been\r\nfull of incident, outcry, and bloodshed. The state of things, indeed,\r\nprevailing in the world for some time past is extraordinary. A\r\nvisitant from another planet would imagine that normal peace and\r\nabnormal war had changed places, and that civilized mankind now regard\r\npeace as an interlude of war, not war as an interlude of peace. He\r\nwould be wrong, of course, but the race in armament, which threatens\r\nto leave the nations taking part in it financially breathless and\r\nexhausted, might easily lead him astray. On some of the situations\r\nwith which these politics are concerned we may briefly touch.\r\n\r\nFor the last three or four years the dominant note in the music of\r\nwhat is called the European Concert, taking Europe for the moment to\r\ninclude Great Britain, has been the state of Anglo-German relations.\r\nThere have been times, as has been seen, when public feeling in both\r\nEngland and Germany was strongly antagonized, but all through the\r\nperiod there has been evident a desire on the part of both Governments\r\nto adopt a mutually conciliatory attitude, and if the war in the\r\nBalkans does not lead to a general international conflagration, which\r\nat present appears improbable, the two countries may arrive at a\r\npermanent understanding. There was, and not so very long ago, a\r\nsimilar state of tension, prolonged for many years, between England\r\nand France. That tension not only ceased, but was converted into\r\npolitical friendship by the Anglo-French Agreement of 1904. Parallel\r\nwith this tension between England and France was the tension between\r\nEngland and Russia, owing to the latter's advance towards England's\r\nIndian possessions. The latter state of things ended with the\r\nAnglo-Russian Agreement of 1907, and it should engender satisfaction\r\nand hope, therefore, to those who now apprehend a war between England\r\nand Germany to note that neither of the tensions referred to, though\r\nboth were long and bitter, developed into war.\r\n\r\nThe tension between England and Germany of late years has been\r\ntightened rather than relaxed by ministerial speeches as well as by\r\nnewspaper polemics in both countries. One of the most disturbing of\r\nthe former was the speech delivered by Mr. Lloyd George at the Mansion\r\nHouse on July 21, 1911. Doubtless with the approval of the Prime\r\nMinister, Mr. Asquith, Mr. Lloyd George said:\r\n\r\n     \"I believe it is essential, in the highest interest not\r\n     merely of this country, but of the world, that Britain\r\n     should at all hazards maintain her place and her prestige\r\n     amongst the Great Powers of the world. Her potent influence\r\n     has many a time been in the past, and may yet be in the\r\n     future, invaluable to the cause of human liberty. It has\r\n     more than once in the past redeemed continental nations,\r\n     which are sometimes too apt to forget that service, from\r\n     overwhelming disasters and even from national extinction. I\r\n     would make great sacrifices to preserve peace. I conceive\r\n     that nothing would justify a disturbance of international\r\n     goodwill except questions of the gravest national moment.\r\n     But if a situation were to be forced upon us in which peace\r\n     could only be preserved by the surrender of the great and\r\n     beneficent position Britain has won by centuries of heroism\r\n     and achievement, by allowing Britain to be treated, where\r\n     her interests are vitally affected, as if she were of no\r\n     account in the cabinet of nations, then I say emphatically\r\n     that peace at that price would be a humiliation intolerable\r\n     for a great country like ours to endure.\"\r\n\r\nThese rhetorical platitudes were uttered at the time of the\r\n\"conversations\" between the French and German Foreign Offices about\r\nthe compensation claimed by Germany for giving France, once for all, a\r\nfree hand in Morocco. Germany was apparently making demands of an\r\nexorbitant character, and what Mr. Lloyd George really meant was that\r\nif Germany persisted in these demands England would fight on the side\r\nof France in order to resist them. As a genuinely democratic speaker,\r\nhowever, he followed the rule of many publicists, who are paid for\r\ntheir articles by the column and say to themselves, \"Why use two words\r\nwhen five will do?\"\r\n\r\nAnother unfortunate remark that may be noted in this connexion was\r\nthat made by Mr. Winston Churchill in referring to the German navy as\r\n\"to some extent a luxury.\" The remark, though true (also to a certain\r\nextent), was unfortunate, for it irritated public opinion in Germany,\r\nwhere it was regarded as a species of impertinent interference.\r\n\r\nAs evidence of the desire on the part of the Emperor and his\r\nGovernment for a friendly arrangement with England may be quoted the\r\nstatement made in December, 1910, by the German Chancellor, Herr von\r\nBethmann-Hollweg, _to_ the following effect:--\r\n\r\n     \"We also meet England in the desire to avoid rivalry in\r\n     regard to armaments, and non-binding _pourparlers_, which\r\n     have from time to time taken place, have been conducted on\r\n     both sides in a friendly spirit. We have always advanced the\r\n     opinion that a frank and sincere interchange of views,\r\n     followed by an understanding with regard to the economic and\r\n     political interests of the two countries, offers the surest\r\n     means of allaying all mistrust on the subject of the\r\n     relations of the Powers to each other on sea and land.\"\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor went on to explain that this mistrust had manifested\r\nitself \"not in the case of the Governments, but of public opinion.\"\r\n\r\nWith regard, in particular, to a naval understanding between England\r\nand Germany, Chancellor von Bülow, in a Budget speech in March, 1909,\r\ndeclared that up to that time no proposals regarding the dimensions of\r\nthe fleets or the amount of naval expenditure which could serve as a\r\nbasis for an understanding had been made on the side of England,\r\nthough non-binding conversations had taken place on the subject\r\nbetween authoritative English and German personalities. In March last\r\nyear (1912) such proposals may be said to have been made in the form\r\nof a suggestion by Sir Edward Grey during the Budget debate that the\r\nratio of 16 to 10 (i.e., 50 per cent. more and 10 per cent. over)\r\nshould express the naval strength of the two countries. The suggestion\r\nwas \"welcomed\" by Admiral von Tirpitz on behalf of Germany in\r\nFebruary, 1913. And there the matter rests.\r\n\r\nA perhaps inevitable result of the tension between England and Germany\r\nduring the period under consideration has been the amount of mutual\r\nespionage discovered to be going on in both countries. An incident\r\nthat attracted wide attention was the arrest in 1910 of Captains\r\nBrandon and Trench, the former of whom was arrested at Borkum and the\r\nlatter at Emden. They were tried before the Supreme Court at Leipzig,\r\nand were both sentenced to incarceration in a fortress for four years.\r\nMany other arrests, prosecutions, and sentences have taken place both\r\nin England and Germany since then, with the consequence that English\r\ntravellers in Germany and German travellers in England, particularly\r\nwhere the travellers are men of military bearing and are in seaside\r\nregions, are now liable, under very small provocation, to a suspicion\r\nof being spies. An English lady recently made the acquaintance of a\r\nGerman in England. He was a very nice man, she said, and went on to\r\nrelate how they were talking one day about Ireland. She happened to\r\nmention Tipperary. \"Oh, I know Tipperary,\" the German officer said;\r\n\"it is in my department.\" \"It was a revelation to me,\" the lady\r\nconcluded when repeating the conversation to her friends. As a matter\r\nof fact, the Intelligence Departments of the army in both Germany and\r\nEngland are well acquainted with the roads, hills, streams, forts,\r\nharbours, and similar details of topography in almost all countries of\r\nthe world besides their own.\r\n\r\nIn regard to 1911 should be recorded the journey of the Crown Prince\r\nand Crown Princess to England to represent the Emperor at the\r\ncoronation of King George in June; the outbreak in September of the\r\nTurco-Italian War, which placed the Emperor in a dilemma, of which one\r\nfork was his duty to Italy as an ally in the Triplice and the other\r\nhis platonic friendship with the Commander of the Faithful; and,\r\nlastly, the suspicion of the Emperor's designs that arose in connexion\r\nwith the fortification of Flushing at a cost to Holland of some\r\n£3,000,000. The Emperor was supposed to have insisted on the\r\nfortification in order to prevent the use of the Netherlands by Great\r\nBritain as a naval base against Germany. Like many another scare in\r\nconnexion with foreign policy, the supposition may be regarded only as\r\na product of intelligent journalistic \"combination.\"\r\n\r\nFinally, among subsidiary occurrences, should be mentioned the meeting\r\nof the Emperor and the Czar in July, 1912, at Port Baltic in Finnish\r\nwaters, accompanied by their Foreign Ministers, with the official\r\nannouncement of the stereotyped \"harmonious relations\" between the two\r\nmonarchs that followed; and the premature prolongation, with the\r\nobject of showing solidarity regarding the Balkan situation, of the\r\nTriple Alliance, which, entered into, as mentioned earlier, in the\r\nyear 1882, had already been renewed in 1891, 1896, and 1902. The next\r\nrenewal should be in 1925, unless in the meantime an international\r\nagreement to which all Great Powers are signatories should render it\r\nsuperfluous.\r\n\r\nThe war in the Balkans need only be referred to in these pages in so\r\nfar as it concerns Germany. The position of Germany in regard to it,\r\nso far, appears simple; she will actively support Austria's larger\r\ninterests in order to keep faith with her chief ally of the Triplice,\r\nand so long as Austria and Russia can agree regarding developments in\r\nthe Balkan situation, there is no danger of war among the Great\r\nPowers. People smiled at the declaration of the Powers some little\r\ntime ago that the _status quo_ in the Balkans should be maintained;\r\nbut it should be remembered that the whole phrase is _status quo ante\r\nbellum_, and that, once war has broken out, the _status_, the position\r\nof affairs, is in a condition of solution, and that no new _status_\r\ncan arise until the war is over and its consequences determined by\r\ntreaties. The result of the present war, let it be hoped, will be to\r\nconfine Turkey to the Orient, where she belongs, and that the Balkan\r\nStates, possibly after a period of internecine feud, will take their\r\nshare in modern European progress and civilization.\r\n\r\nThe amount of declaration, asseveration, recrimination (chiefly\r\njournalistic), rectification, intimidation, protestation,\r\npacification, and many other wordy processes that have been employed\r\nin almost all countries with the avowed object of maintaining peace\r\nduring the last four years is in striking contrast to the small\r\nprogress actually made in regard to a final settlement of either of\r\nthe two great international points at issue--the limitation of\r\narmaments and compulsory arbitration.\r\n\r\nEnough perhaps has been said in preceding pages to show the attitude\r\nof the Emperor, and consequently the attitude of his Government,\r\ntowards them. A history of the long agitation in connexion with them\r\nis beyond the scope of this work. The agitation itself, however, may\r\nbe viewed as a step, though not a very long one, on the way to the\r\ndesired solution, and it is a matter for congratulation that the two\r\nsubjects have been, and are still being, so freely and copiously and,\r\non the whole, so sympathetically and hopefully ventilated. The great\r\ndifficulty, apparently, is to find what diplomatists call the proper\r\n\"formula\"--the law-that-must-be-obeyed. Unfortunately, the finding of\r\nthe formula cannot be regarded as the end of the matter; there still\r\nremains the finding of what jurists call the \"sanction,\" that is to\r\nsay, the power to enforce the formula when found and to punish any\r\nnation which fails to act in accordance with it. Nothing but an\r\nAreopagus of the nations can furnish such a sanction, but with the\r\npresent arrangements for balancing power in Europe, to say nothing of\r\nthe ineradicable pugnacity, greed, and ambition of human nature, such\r\nan Areopagus seems very like an impossibility. Time, however, may\r\nbring it about. If it should, and the Golden Age begin to dawn, an\r\nepoch of new activities and new horizons, quite possibly more novel\r\nand interesting than any which has ever preceded it, will open for\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EMPEROR TO-DAY\r\n\r\nWhat strikes one most, perhaps, on looking back over the Emperor's\r\nlife and time, are two surprising inconsistencies, one relating to the\r\nEmperor himself, the other to that part of his time with which he has\r\nbeen most closely identified.\r\n\r\nThe first arises from the fact that a man so many-sided, so impulsive,\r\nso progressive, so modern--one might almost say so American--should\r\nhave altered so little either in character or policy during quarter of\r\na century. This is due to what we have called his mediæval nature. He\r\nis to-day the same Hohenzollern he was the day he mounted the throne,\r\nobserving exactly the same attitude to the world abroad and to his\r\nfolk at home, tenacious of exactly the same principles, enunciating\r\nexactly the same views in politics, religion, morals, and art--in\r\neverything which concerns the foundations of social life. He still\r\nbelieves himself, as his speeches and conduct show, the selected\r\ninstrument of Heaven, and acts towards his people and addresses them\r\naccordingly. He still opposes all efforts at political change, as\r\nwitness his attitude towards electoral reform, towards the\r\nGermanization of Prussian Poland, towards the Socialists, towards\r\nLiberalism in all its manifestations. He is still, as he was at the\r\noutset of his reign, the patron of classical art, classical drama, and\r\nclassical music. He is still the War Lord with the spirit of a bishop\r\nand a bishop with the spirit of the War Lord. He is still the model\r\nhusband and father he always has been. Most men change one way or\r\nanother as time goes on. With the Emperor time for five-and-twenty\r\nyears appears to have stood still.\r\n\r\nThe inconsistency relating to his time arises from the contrast\r\nbetween the real and the seeming character of the reign. For,\r\nstrikingly and anomalously enough, while the Emperor has been steadily\r\npursuing an economic policy, a policy of peace, his entire reign, as\r\none turns over the pages of its history, seems to resound, during\r\nalmost every hour, with martial shoutings, confused noises, the\r\nclatter of harness, the clash of swords, and the tramp of armies. From\r\nmoment to moment it recalls those scenes from Shakespearean drama in\r\nwhich indeed no dead are actually seen upon the stage, but at\r\nintervals the air is filled with battle cries, \"with excursions and\r\nalarms,\" with warriors brandishing their weapons, calling for horses,\r\nhacking at imaginary foes, and defying the world in arms.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in reality it has been a period of domestic peace throughout.\r\nThough there has been incessant talk of war, and at times war may have\r\nbeen near, it never came, unless the South West African and Boxer\r\nexpeditions be so called. Commerce and trade have gone on increasing\r\nby leaps and bounds. The population has grown at the rate of nearly\r\nthree-quarters of a million a year. Emperor William the First's social\r\npolicy has been closely followed. The navy has been built, the army\r\nstrengthened, the Empire's finances reorganized; in whatever direction\r\none looks one finds a record of solid and substantial and peaceful\r\nprogress and prosperity. A great deal of it is owing, admittedly, to\r\nthe Germans themselves, but no small share of it is due to the\r\n\"impulsive\" Emperor's consistency of character and conduct.\r\n\r\nProbably the inconsistencies are only apparent. Germany and her\r\nEmperor have grown, not developed, if by development is meant a\r\nradical alteration in structure or mentality, and if regard is had to\r\nthe real Germany and the real Emperor, not to the Germany of the\r\ntourist, and not to the Emperor of contemporary criticism. It has been\r\nseen that the Emperor's nature and policy have not altered. The\r\nConstitution of Germany has not altered, nor her Press, nor her\r\npolitical parties, nor her social system, nor, indeed, any of the\r\nvital institutions of her national life. With one possible\r\nexception--the navy. The navy is a new organic feature, and, like all\r\norganisms, is exerting deep and far-reaching influences. Germany, of\r\ncourse, is in a process of development, a state of transition. But\r\nnations are at all times in a state of transition, more or less\r\nobvious; and it will require yet a good many years to show what new\r\nforms and fruits the development now going on in Germany is to bring.\r\nThe Emperor, it is safe to say, will remain the same, mediæval in\r\nnature, modern in character, to the end of his life.\r\n\r\nThe main thing, however, to be noted both about Germany and the German\r\nEmperor is what they stand for in the movement of world-ideas at the\r\npresent time. Germans cause foreigners to smile when they prophesy\r\nthat their culture, their civilization, will become the culture and\r\nthe civilization of the world. The sameness of ideas that prevailed in\r\nmediæval times about life and religion--about this life and the life\r\nto come--was succeeded, and first in Germany, by an enormous diversity\r\nof ideas about life and religion, beginning with the Rationalism (or\r\n\"enlightenment,\" as the Germans call it) which set in after the\r\nReformation and the Renaissance; and this diversity again\r\npromises--let us at least hope--to go back, in one of the great\r\ncircles that make one think human thought, too, moves in accordance\r\nwith planetary laws, to a sameness of views among the nations in\r\nregard to the real interests of society, which are peace, religious\r\nharmony through toleration, commercial harmony through international\r\nintercourse, and the mutual goodwill of governments and peoples. For\r\nall this order of ideas the Emperor, notwithstanding his mailed fist\r\nand shining armour, stands, and in this spirit both he and the German\r\nmind are working.\r\n\r\nMore than half a century has passed over the Emperor's head; let us\r\nlook a little more closely at him as the man and the monarch he is\r\nto-day. Time appears to have dealt gently with him; the heart, one\r\nhears it said, never grows bald, and in all but years the Emperor is\r\nprobably as young and untiring as ever.\r\n\r\nHis personal appearance has altered little in the last decade. An\r\nobserver, who had an opportunity of seeing him at close quarters in\r\n1902, describes him, as he then appeared, as follows:--\r\n\r\n     \"I was standing within arm's length of him at Cuxhaven,\r\n     where we were waiting the landing of Prince Henry, his\r\n     brother, on his return from America. The _Deutschland_ had\r\n     to be warped alongside the quay, and the Emperor, in the\r\n     uniform of a Prussian general of infantry, meanwhile mixed\r\n     with the suite and chatted, now to one, now to another, with\r\n     his usual bonhomie. I was speaking to the American attaché,\r\n     Captain H----, when the Emperor came up, and naturally I\r\n     stood a little to one side.\r\n\r\n     \"The thing that most struck me was the Emperor's large grey\r\n     eyes. As they looked sharply into those of Captain H---- or\r\n     glanced in my direction, they seemed to show absolutely no\r\n     feeling, no sentiment of any kind. Not that they gave the\r\n     notion of hardness or falsity. They were simply like two\r\n     grey mirrors on which outward things made no impression.\r\n\r\n     \"Two other features did not strike me as anything out of the\r\n     ordinary, but the whole face had an air of ability,\r\n     cleverness, briskness, and health. The Emperor is about\r\n     middle height, with the body very erect, the walk firm, and\r\n     is very energetic in his gestures. I did not notice the\r\n     shortness of the left arm, but that may have been because\r\n     his left hand was leaning on his sword-hilt. Captain H----\r\n     told me he could not put on his overcoat without assistance,\r\n     and that the hand is so weak he can do very little with it.\r\n     There was nothing of a Hohenzollern hanging under-lip.\"\r\n\r\nThe following judgment was formed a year or two ago by an American\r\ndiplomatist: \"I have often met him,\" the diplomatist said,\r\n\r\n     \"and only speak of the impression he made on me. I would\r\n     describe him as intelligent rather than intellectual. He\r\n     appreciates men of learning and of philosophic mind, and\r\n     while not learned and philosophic himself, enjoys seeing the\r\n     learned and philosophic at work, and gladly recognizes their\r\n     merit when their labours are thorough and well done. His\r\n     mind is marvellously quick, but it does not dwell on\r\n     anything for long at a time. It takes in everything\r\n     presented to it in, so to speak, a hop, skip, and jump.\r\n\r\n     \"In company he is never at rest, and surprises one by his\r\n     lively play of features and the entirely natural and\r\n     unaffected expression of his thoughts. He is sitting at a\r\n     lecture, perhaps, when a notion occurs to him, and forthwith\r\n     indicates it by a humorous grimace or wink to some one\r\n     sitting far away from him. He is always saying unexpected\r\n     things. On the whole, he is a right good fellow, and I can\r\n     imagine that, though he can come down hard on one with a\r\n     heavy hand and stern look, he does not do so by the instinct\r\n     of a despot, but acting under a sense of duty.\"\r\n\r\nAnother diplomatist has remarked the Emperor's habit in conversation\r\nof tapping the person he is talking to on the shoulder and of\r\nscrutinizing him all over--\"ears, nose, clothes, until it makes one\r\nfeel quite uncomfortable.\"\r\n\r\nThe next sketch of him is as he may be seen any day during the\r\nyachting week in June at Kiel:--\r\n\r\n     \"The Emperor is in the smoking-room of the Yacht Club,\r\n     dressed in a blue lounge suit with a white peaked cap. He is\r\n     sitting carelessly on the side of a table, dangling his legs\r\n     and discussing with fellow-members and foreign yachtsmen the\r\n     experience of the day, now speaking English, now French, now\r\n     German. He seems quite in his element as sportsman, and puts\r\n     every one at ease round him. His expression is animated and\r\n     his voice hearty, if a little strident to foreign ears. His\r\n     right hand and arm are in ceaseless movement, emphasizing\r\n     and enforcing everything he says. He asks many questions and\r\n     often invites opinion, and when it differs from his own, as\r\n     sometimes happens, he takes it quite good-humouredly.\"\r\n\r\nTo-day the Emperor is outwardly much the same as he has just been\r\ndescribed. He is perhaps slightly more inclined to stoutness. His\r\nfeatures, though they speak of cleverness and manliness, are forgotten\r\nas one looks into the keen and quickly moving grey eyes with their\r\npeculiar dash of yellow. He is well set up, as is proper for a soldier\r\never actively engaged in military duties, and his stride continues\r\nfirm and elastic. He is still constantly in the saddle. His hair,\r\nstill abundant, is yet beginning to show the first touches of the\r\ncoming frost of age, and the reddish brown moustache, once famous for\r\nits haughtily upturned ends, has taken, either naturally or by the aid\r\nof Herr Haby, the Court barber, who attends him daily, a nearly level\r\nform.\r\n\r\nIn public, whether mounted or on foot, he preserves the somewhat stern\r\nair he evidently thinks appropriate to his high station, but more\r\nfrequently than formerly the features relax into a pleasant smile. The\r\ncolour of the face is healthy, tending to rosiness, and the general\r\nimpression given is that of a clever man, conscious, yet not\r\noverconscious, of his dignity. The shortness of the left arm, a defect\r\nfrom birth, is hardly noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe extirpation of a polypus from the Emperor's throat in 1903, which\r\nmust have been one of the severest trials of his life when the history\r\nof his father's mortal illness is remembered, might lead one to\r\nsuppose that his vocal organs would always suffer from the effects of\r\nthe operation. It has fortunately turned out otherwise. His voice was\r\noriginally strong by nature, and remains so. It never seems tired,\r\neven when, as it often does, it pleases him to read aloud for his own\r\npleasure or that of a circle of friends. It frequently occurs that he\r\nwill pick up a book, one of his ancient favourites, Horace or Homer\r\nperhaps, Mr. Stewart Houston Chamberlain's \"Foundations of the\r\nNineteenth Century\"--a work he greatly admires--or a modern\r\npublication he has read of in the papers, and read aloud from it for\r\nan hour or an hour and a half at a time. Nor is his reading aloud\r\nconfined to classical or German books. He is equally disposed to\r\nchoose works in English or French or Italian, and when he reads these\r\nhe is fond of doing so with a particularly clear and distinct\r\nenunciation, partly as practice for himself, and partly that his\r\nhearers may understand with certainty. This is not all, for there\r\ninvariably follows a discussion upon what has been read, and in it the\r\nEmperor takes a constant and often emphatic part. It has been remarked\r\nthat at the close of the longest sitting of this character his voice\r\nis as strong and sonorous as at the beginning.\r\n\r\nHe is still the early riser and hard worker he has always been; still\r\ndevotes the greater part of his time to the duties that fall to him as\r\nWar Lord; still races about the Empire by train or motor-car,\r\nreviewing troops, laying foundation-stones, unveiling statues,\r\ndedicating churches, attending manoeuvres, encouraging yachting at\r\nKiel by his presence during the yachting week, or hurrying off to meet\r\nthe monarch of a foreign country. He still enjoys his annual trip\r\nalong the shores of Norway or breaks away from the cares of State to\r\npass a few weeks at his Corfu castle, dazzling in its marble whiteness\r\nand overlooking the Acroceraunian mountains, or to hunt or shoot at\r\nthe country seat of some influential or wealthy subject. In fine, he\r\nis still engaged with all the energy of his nature, if in a somewhat\r\nless flamboyant fashion than during his earlier years, in his, as he\r\nbelieves, divinely appointed work of guiding Prussia's destiny and\r\nbuilding up the German Empire.\r\n\r\nIt is because he is an Empire-builder that his numerous journeys\r\nabroad and restlessness of movement at home have earned for him the\r\nnickname of the \"travelling Kaiser.\" The Germans themselves do not\r\nunderstand his conduct in this respect. If one urges that Hohenzollern\r\nkings, and none of them more than the Great Elector and Frederick the\r\nGreat, were incessant travellers, they will reply that their kings had\r\nto be so at a time when the Empire was not yet established, when\r\nrebellious nobles had to be subdued, and when the spirit of\r\nprovincialism and particularism had to be counteracted. Hence, they\r\nsay, former Hohenzollerns had to exercise personal control in all\r\nparts of their dominions, see that their military dispositions were\r\ncarried out, and study social and economic conditions on the spot; but\r\nnowadays, when the Empire is firmly established, when the\r\nadministration is working like a clock and the post and telegraph are\r\nat command, the Emperor should stay at home and direct everything from\r\nhis capital.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor himself evidently takes a different view. He does not\r\nconsider the forty-year-old Empire as completed and consolidated, but\r\nregards it much as the Great Elector or Frederick the Great regarded\r\nPrussia when that kingdom was in the making. He believes in\r\npropagating the imperial idea by his personal presence in all parts of\r\nthe Empire, and at the same time observing the progress that is being\r\nmade there. He is, finally, a believer in getting into personal touch,\r\nas far as is possible, with foreign monarchs, foreign statesmen, and\r\nforeign peoples, for he doubtless sees that with every decade the\r\ninterests of nations are becoming more closely identified.\r\n\r\nIn connexion with the subject of the Emperor's travelling, mention may\r\nbe made of the fact that many years ago he thought it necessary to\r\nexplain himself publicly in reference to the idea, prevalent among his\r\npeople at the time, that he was travelling too much. \"On my travels,\"\r\nhe said,\r\n\r\n     \"I design not only to make myself acquainted with foreign\r\n     countries and institutions, and to foster friendly relations\r\n     with neighbouring rulers, but these journeys, which have\r\n     been often misinterpreted, have high value in enabling me to\r\n     observe home affairs from a distance and submit them to a\r\n     quiet examination.\"\r\n\r\nHe expresses something in the same order of thought in a speech\r\ntelling of his reflections on the high sea concerning his\r\nresponsibilities as ruler:\r\n\r\n     \"When one is alone on the high sea, with only God's starry\r\n     heaven above him, and holds communion with himself, one will\r\n     not fail to appreciate the value of such a journey. I could\r\n     wish many of my countrymen to live through hours like these,\r\n     in which one can take reckoning of what he has designed and\r\n     what achieved. Then one would be cured of over\r\n     self-estimation--and that we all need.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the Emperor is about to start on a journey, confidential\r\ntelegrams are sent to the railway authorities concerned, and\r\nimmediately a thorough inspection of the line the Emperor is about to\r\ntravel over is ordered. Tunnels, bridges, points, railway crossings,\r\nare all subjected to examination, and spare engines kept in immediate\r\nreadiness in case of a breakdown occurring to the imperial train. The\r\npolice of the various towns through which the monarch is to pass are\r\nalso communicated with and their help requisitioned in taking\r\nprecautions for his safety. Like any private person, the Emperor pays\r\nhis own fares, which are reckoned at the rate of an average of fifteen\r\nshillings to one pound sterling a mile. A recent journey to\r\nSwitzerland cost him in fares £200. Of late years he has saved money\r\nin this respect by the more frequent use of the royal motor-cars. The\r\nroyal train is put together by selecting those required from fifteen\r\ncarriages which are always ready for an imperial journey. If the\r\njourney is short, a saloon carriage and refreshment car are deemed\r\nsufficient; in case of a long journey the train consists of a buffer\r\ncarriage in addition, with two saloon cars for the suite and two\r\nwagons for the luggage. The train is always accompanied by a high\r\nofficial of the railway, who, with mechanics and spare guard, is in\r\ndirect telephonic communication with the engine-driver and guard. The\r\ncarriages are coloured alike, ivory-white above the window-line and\r\nlacquered blue below.\r\n\r\nAll the carriages, with the exception of the saloon dining-car, are of\r\nthe corridor type. A table runs down the centre of the dining-car; the\r\nEmperor takes his seat in the centre, while the rest of the suite and\r\nguests take their places at random, save that the elder travellers are\r\nsupposed to seat themselves about the Emperor. If the Emperor has\r\nguests with him they naturally have seats beside or in the near\r\nneighbourhood of their host. Breakfast is taken about half-past eight,\r\nlunch at one, and dinner at seven or eight. The Emperor is always\r\ntalkative at table, and often draws into conversation the remoter\r\nmembers of the company, occasionally calling to them by their nickname\r\nor a pet name. He sits for an hour or two after dinner, with a glass\r\nof beer and a huge box of cigars before him, discussing the incidents\r\nof the journey or recalling his experiences at various periods of his\r\nreign.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's disposition of the year remains much what it was at the\r\nbeginning of the reign. The chief changes in it are the omission of a\r\nyachting visit to Cowes, which he made annually from 1889 to 1895,\r\nand, since 1908, the habit of making an annual summer stay at his\r\nCorfu castle, \"Achilleion,\" instead of touring in the Mediterranean\r\nand visiting Italian cities. January is spent in Berlin in connexion\r\nwith the New Year festivities, ambassadorial and other Court\r\nreceptions, drawing-rooms, and balls, and the celebration of his\r\nbirthday on the 27th. The Berlin season extends into the middle of\r\nFebruary, so that part of that month also is spent in Berlin. During\r\nthe latter half of February and in March the Emperor is usually at\r\nPotsdam, occasionally motoring to Berlin to give audience or for some\r\nspecial occasion. April and part of May are passed in Corfu. Towards\r\nthe end of May the Emperor returns to Germany and goes to Wiesbaden\r\nfor the opera and Festspiele in the royal theatre; but he must be in\r\nBerlin before May has closed, for the spring parade of the Berlin and\r\nPotsdam garrisons on the vast Tempelhofer Field. His return on\r\nhorseback from this parade is always the occasion of popular\r\nenthusiasm in Berlin's principal streets. In early June the Emperor\r\nstays at Potsdam or perhaps pays a visit to some wealthy noble, and at\r\nthe end of the month the yachting week calls him to Kiel. Once that is\r\nover he proceeds on his annual tour along the coast of Norway.\r\nSeptember sees him back in Germany for the autumn manoeuvres. October\r\nand November are devoted to shooting at Rominten or some other\r\nimperial hunting lodge, or with some large landowner or industrial\r\nmagnate. The whole of December is usually spent at Potsdam, save for\r\nan annual visit to his friend Prince Fürstenberg at Donaueschingen.\r\nNaturally he is in Potsdam for Christmas, when all the imperial family\r\nassemble to celebrate the festival in good old German style.\r\n\r\nIn music, as we know, he retains the classical tastes he has always\r\ncultivated and sometimes dictatorially recommended. Good music, he has\r\nsaid, is like a piece of lace, not like a display of fireworks. He\r\nstill has most musical enjoyment in listening to Bach and Handel. The\r\nformer he has spoken of as one of the most \"modern\" of composers, and\r\nwill point out that his works contain melodious passages that might be\r\nthe musical thought of Franz Lehar or Leo Fall. He has no great liking\r\nfor the music of Richard Strauss, and his admiration of Wagner, if\r\ncertain themes, that must, one feels, have been drawn from the music\r\nof the spheres, be excepted, is respectful rather than rapturous. Of\r\nWagner's works the \"Meistersingers\" is \"my favourite.\"\r\n\r\nA faculty that in the Emperor has developed with the years is that of\r\napplying a sense of humour, not originally small, to the events of\r\neveryday life. He is always ready to joke with his soldiers and\r\nsailors, with artists, professors, ministers--in short, with men of\r\nevery class and occupation. Several stories in illustration of his\r\nhumour are current, but a homely example or two may here suffice. He\r\nis sitting in semi-darkness in the parquet at the Royal Opera House.\r\n\"Le Prophète\" is in rehearsal, and it is the last act, in which there\r\nis a powder cask, ready to blow everything to atoms, standing outside\r\nthe cathedral. Fraulein Frieda Hempel, as the heroine, appears with a\r\nlighted torch and is about to take her seat on the cask. Suddenly the\r\nimperial voice is heard from the semi-gloom: \"Fraulein Hempel, it is\r\nevident you haven't had a military training or you wouldn't take a\r\nlight so near a barrel of gunpowder.\" And the _prima donna_ has to\r\ntake her place on the other side of the stage. Or he is presenting\r\nProfessor Siegfried Ochs, the famous manager of the Philharmonic\r\nConcerts, with the Order of the Red Eagle, third class, and with a\r\nfriendly smile gracefully excuses himself for conferring an \"Order of\r\nthe third class on a musician of the first class,\" by pleading\r\nofficial rule. A third popular anecdote tells of a lady seated beside\r\nhim at the dinner-table. Salad is being offered to her, but she thinks\r\nshe is bound to give all her attention to the Emperor and takes no\r\nnotice of it. Thereupon the Emperor: \"Gnadige Frau, an Emperor can\r\nwait, but the salad cannot.\" Possibly the Emperor had in mind Louis\r\nXIII, who complained that he never ate a plate of warm soup in his\r\nlife, it had to pass through so many hands to reach him.\r\n\r\nThe German takes his theatre as he takes life, seriously. To cough\r\nduring a performance attracts embarrassing attention, a sneeze almost\r\namounts to misdemeanour. To the German the theatre is a part of the\r\nmachinery of culture, and accordingly he is not so easily bored as the\r\nAnglo-Saxon playgoer, who demands that drama shall contain that great\r\nessential of all good drama, action. To the Anglo-Saxon, the more\r\nplentiful and rapid the action is, the better. The German, differing\r\nfrom most Anglo-Saxons, likes historical scenes, great processions,\r\ncostume festivals, the representation of mediæval events in which his\r\nmonarchs and generals played conspicuous parts. The Emperor has the\r\nsame disposition and taste.\r\n\r\nYet both national taste and disposition, like other of the nation's\r\ncharacteristics, are slowly altering with the growth of the modern\r\nspirit, and Germans now begin to require something of a more modern\r\nkind, a more social order, something that comes home more to their\r\nbusiness and bosoms. Greater variety in subject is asked for, more\r\nlaughter and tears, more representations of scenes and life dealing\r\nwith everyday doings and the fate of the people as distinguished from\r\nthe doings and fate of their rulers and the upper classes. The Emperor\r\nhas not followed his people in the new direction. He regards the stage\r\nas a vehicle of patriotism, an instrument of education, a guider of\r\nartistic taste, an inculcator of old-time morality. Its aim, he\r\nappears to think, is not to help to produce, primarily, the good man\r\nand good citizen, but the good man and good monarchist,\r\nand--perhaps--not so much primarily the good monarchist as the liege\r\nsubject of the Hohenzollern dynasty. Having secured this, he looks for\r\nthe elevation of the public taste along his own lines. He assumes that\r\nthe public taste can be elevated from without, from above, when it can\r\nonly be elevated proportionately with its progress in general\r\neducation and its purification from within. Consequently he is for the\r\n\"classical,\" as in the other arts. But apart from its aims and uses,\r\nthe theatre has always appealed to him. His fondness for it is a\r\nHohenzollern characteristic, which has shown itself, with more or less\r\nemphasis, in monarch after monarch of the line. Nor is it surprising\r\nthat monarchs should take pleasure in the stage, since the theatre is\r\none of the places which brings them and their subjects together in the\r\nenjoyment of common emotions, and shows them, if only at second hand,\r\nthe domestic lives of millions, from personal acquaintance with which\r\ntheir royal birth and surroundings exclude them.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor treats all artists, male and female, in the same friendly\r\nand unaffected manner. There is never the least soupçon of\r\ncondescension in the one case or flirtation in the other, but in both\r\na lively and often unexpectedly well-informed interest in the play or\r\nother artistic performance of the occasion, and in the actors' or\r\nactresses' personal records. The nationality of the artist has\r\napparently nothing to do with this interest. The Emperor invites\r\nFrench, Italian, English, American or Scandinavian artists to the\r\nroyal box after a performance as often as he invites the artists of\r\nhis own country, and, once launched on a conversation, nothing gives\r\nhim more pleasure than to expound his views on music, painting, or the\r\ndrama, as the case may be. \"Tempo--rhythm--colour,\" he has been heard\r\nto insist on to a conductor whom in the heat of his conviction he had\r\ngradually edged into a corner and before whom he stood with\r\ngesticulating arms--\"All the rest is _Schwindel_.\" At an entertainment\r\ngiven by Ambassador Jules Cambon at the French Embassy after the\r\nMorocco difficulty had been finally adjusted, he became so interested\r\nwhile talking to a group of French actors that high dignatories of the\r\nEmpire, including Princes, the Imperial Chancellor and Ministers,\r\nstanding in another part of the _salon_, grew impatient and had to\r\ndetach one of their number to call the Emperor's attention to their\r\npresence. Since then, it is whispered, it has become the special\r\nfunction of an adjutant, when the occasion demands it, diplomatically\r\nand gently to withdraw the imperial _causeur_ from too absorbing\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\nSeveral anecdotes are current having reference to the Emperor as\r\nsportsman. One of them, for example, mentions a loving-cup of\r\nFrederick William III's time, kept at the hunting lodge of Letzlingen,\r\nwhich is filled with champagne and must be emptied at a draught by\r\nanyone visiting the lodge for the first time. This is great fun for\r\nthe Emperor, who a year or two ago made a number of Berlin guests,\r\nincluding Chancellor von Bethmann-Hollweg, the Austrian Ambassador,\r\nSzoghenyi-Marich, the Secretary for the Navy, Admiral von Tirpitz, and\r\nthe Crown Prince of Greece stand before him and drain the cup. As the\r\nstory goes, \"the attempts of the guests to drink out of the heavy cup,\r\nwhich is fixed into a set of antlers in such a way as to make it\r\ndifficult to drink without spilling the wine, caused great amusement.\"\r\n\r\nThe principles of sport generally, it may be here interpolated, are\r\nnot quite the same in Germany as in England, though no country has\r\nimitated England in regard to sport so closely and successfully as\r\nGermany. Up to a comparatively few years ago the Germans had neither\r\ninclination nor means for it, and though always enthusiastic hunters,\r\nhunting--not the English fox-hunting, but hunting the boar and the\r\nbear, the wolf and the deer--was almost the sole form of manly sport\r\npractised. _Turnen_, the most popular sort of German indoor\r\ngymnastics, only began in 1861, a couple of years after the birth of\r\nthe Emperor. There are now nearly a dozen cricket clubs alone in\r\nBerlin, football clubs all over the Empire, tennis clubs in every\r\ntown, rowing clubs at all the seaports and along the large rivers,\r\nnearly all following English rules and in numerous cases using English\r\nsporting terms. At the same time sport is not the religion it is in\r\nEngland--indeed, to keep up the metaphor, hardly a living creed.\r\n\r\nThe German attitude towards sport is not altogether the same as the\r\nEnglish attitude. In England the object of the game is that the best\r\nman shall win, that he shall not be in any way unfairly or unequally\r\nhandicapped _vis-à-vis_ his opponent, and the honour, not the\r\nintrinsic value of the prize, is the main consideration. These\r\nprinciples are not yet fully understood or adopted in Germany,\r\npossibly owing to the early military training of the German youth\r\nmaking the carrying off the prize anyhow and by any means the main\r\nobject. It is _Realpolitik_ in sport, and a _Realpolitik_ which is not\r\nwholly unknown in England; but while the spirit of _Realpolitik_ is\r\nstill perceivable in German sport, it is equally perceivable that the\r\nstandard English way of viewing sporting competition is becoming more\r\nand more approached in Germany.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor is an enthusiastic patron of sport of all healthy outdoor\r\nkinds, not as sympathizing with the English youth's disposition to\r\nregard play as work and work as play, to give to his business any time\r\nhe can spare from his sport, but because he estimates at its full\r\nvalue its place in the national health-budget. His personal likings\r\nare for bear-shooting, deer-stalking, and yachting, but he also wields\r\nthe lawn-tennis racket and the rapier with fair skill. The names of\r\nseveral of his hunting lodges---Rominten, Springe, Hubertusstock, and\r\nso on--are familiar to many people in all countries. Rominten preserve\r\nis in East Prussia, and embraces about four square miles, with\r\nlittle lakes and some rising ground. September is the Emperor's\r\nfavourite month for visiting it. Here one year he shot a famous\r\neight-and-twenty-ender antelope, which had come across from Russian\r\nterritory. Before the present reign the deer, or pig, or other wild\r\nanimal used to be beaten up to the royal sportsman of the day, but\r\nthat practice has long ceased, and the Emperor has to tramp many a\r\nmile, and at times crawl on all fours for hundreds of yards, to get a\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the Emperor's position as King and Emperor renders\r\ninevitable his adoption, either of natural bent, which is extremely\r\nprobable, or from a policy in harmony with the wishes of his people,\r\nof a view of the monarch's office that to perhaps most Englishmen\r\nliving under parliamentary rule must seem antiquated, not to say\r\nabsurd. This attitude apart, the Emperor possesses, as it is hoped has\r\nbeen sufficiently shown, as modern and progressive a spirit as any of\r\nhis contemporaries. His instant recognition of all useful modern\r\nappliances, particularly, of course, those of possible service in war,\r\nis a prominent feature of his mentality. He went, doubtless, too far\r\nin heralding Count Zeppelin, in 1909, as \"the greatest man of the\r\ncentury,\" but the very words he chose to use marked his appreciation\r\nof the new aeronautical science Count Zeppelin was introducing.\r\nSimilarly, the moment the automobile had entered on the stage of\r\nreliability it won a place in the imperial favour, and is now his most\r\nconstant means of locomotion. He has never, it is true, emulated the\r\nenterprise of his son, the Crown Prince, whom Mr. Orville Wright had\r\nas a companion for a quarter of an hour in the air at Potsdam three\r\nyears ago, but his interest in the aeroplane is none the less keen\r\nbecause he is too conscious of his responsibilities to subject his\r\nlife to unnecessary risk.\r\n\r\nBefore closing our sketch of the Emperor as a man by quoting\r\nappreciations written by two contemporary writers, one German and the\r\nother English, it may be added that there is a statesman still--it is\r\npleasant to think--alive who could, an he only would, draw the\r\nEmperor's character perfectly, both as man and monarch. Indeed, as has\r\nbeen seen, he has more than once sketched parts of it in Parliament,\r\nbut only parts--the whole character of the Emperor, on all its sides\r\nand in all its ramifications, has yet to be revealed. Here need only\r\nbe quoted what Chancellor Bülow--and also, by the way, Princess\r\nBülow--publicly said about the Emperor as man. The Prince's most\r\nnoteworthy statement was made in the Reichstag in 1903, when, in\r\nanswer to Leader-of-the-Opposition Bebel, the Prince said, \"One thing\r\nat least, the Emperor is no Philistine,\" and proceeded to explain,\r\nrather negatively and disappointingly, that the Emperor possesses what\r\nthe Greeks call megalopsychia--a great soul. One knows but too well\r\nthe English Philistine, that stolid, solid, self-sufficient bulwark of\r\nthe British Constitution. The German Philistine is his twin brother,\r\nthe narrow-minded, conservative burgher. Other epithets the Prince\r\napplied to the imperial character were \"simple,\" \"natural,\" \"hearty,\"\r\n\"magnanimous,\" \"clear-headed,\" and \"straightforward\"; while Princess\r\nBülow, during a conversation her husband was having with the French\r\njournalist, M. Jules Huret, in 1907, interjected the remark that he\r\nwas \"a person of good birth, _fils de bonne maison_, the descendant of\r\ndistinguished ancestors, and a modern man of great intelligence.\"\r\n\r\nBut let us see how the Emperor appears to his contemporaries. Dr. Paul\r\nLiman, who has made the most serious attempt to sketch the character\r\nof the Emperor that has yet appeared in German, writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"We see in him a nature whose ground-tone is enthusiasm,\r\n     phantasy, and a passionate impulse towards action. Filled\r\n     with the highest sense of the imperial rights and duties\r\n     assigned to him, convinced that these are the direct\r\n     expression of a divine will, he has inwardly thrown off the\r\n     bonds of modern constitutional ideas and in words recently\r\n     spoken, where he claimed responsibility for fifty-eight\r\n     million people, converted these ideas into a formula that,\r\n     while unconstitutional, is yet moral and deeply earnest.\r\n     These words were doubly valuable as giving insight into the\r\n     soul of a man who can be mistaken in his conclusions and\r\n     means, but not in his motives, since these are directed to\r\n     the general weal. Here, too, we find the explanation of the\r\n     fact that at one time he comes before us surrounded with the\r\n     blue and hazy nimbus of the romantic period, and at another\r\n     as the most modern prince of our time. Out of the rise in\r\n     him of the consciousness of majesty there grows a greater\r\n     sense of duty, and instead of keeping watch from his turret\r\n     over his people he loses himself in detail. And precisely\r\n     here must he fail, because modern life with its development\r\n     is far too rich in complications and activities to admit of\r\n     its submitting to patriarchal benevolence. And because an\r\n     artistic strain and a strong fantasy simultaneously work in\r\n     him, he moves joyfully beyond the limits of the actual to\r\n     raise before our eyes the highly coloured dream of the\r\n     picture of a time in which all men, all nations, will be\r\n     friendly and reconciled--an artist's dream. Here is\r\n     something characteristic, something unusual, to give\r\n     particular charm to a personality which has no parallel in\r\n     the history of the dynasty hitherto. There may be concealed\r\n     in it the seed of illustrious deeds, but only too often\r\n     disappointment and contempt lie scornfully in wait when the\r\n     deed is accomplished. For the heaven we erect on earth\r\n     always comes to naught, and the idealist is always\r\n     vanquished in the strife with fact.\"\r\n\r\nSo far, Dr. Liman. Mr. Sydney Brooks, in a sketch in _Maclure's\r\nMagazine_ for July, 1910, writes:--\r\n\r\n     \"The drawback to any and to every _régime_ of paternal\r\n     absolutism is that the human mind is limited. The Kaiser\r\n     will not admit it, but his acts prove it. It is not given to\r\n     one man to know more about everything than anybody else\r\n     knows about anything; and the Kaiser, who is a good deal of\r\n     a dilettante, and believes himself omniscient, at times\r\n     speaks from a lamentable half-knowledge, and occasionally\r\n     has to call in the imperial authority to back up his\r\n     verdicts against the judgments of experts.\r\n\r\n     \"Unquestionably his mind is of an unusual order. It is a\r\n     facile, quickly moving instrument; it works in flashes; it\r\n     assimilates seemingly without effort, and it is at its best\r\n     under the highest pressure. The Kaiser is not to be laughed\r\n     at for wanting to know all there is to be known, but he may\r\n     justly be criticized for failing to distinguish between the\r\n     attempt and its failure....\r\n\r\n     \"Is it all charlatanerie? Is it all of a part with his\r\n     speech in Russian to the regiment of which the Czar made him\r\n     honorary colonel, a studied trumpery effort, designed for a\r\n     momentary effect? Is the Kaiser just glitter and tinsel,\r\n     impulse and rhapsody, with nothing solid beneath? Is it his\r\n     supreme object to make an impression at any cost, to force,\r\n     like another Nero, the popular applause by arts more\r\n     becoming to a _cabotin_ than a sovereign? Vanity,\r\n     restlessness, a consuming desire for the palm without the\r\n     dust--an intense and theatrical egotism--are these the\r\n     qualities that give the clue to his character and actions?\r\n\r\n     \"I do not think so altogether. The Kaiser has scattered too\r\n     much. In an age of specialists on many subjects he speaks\r\n     like an amateur. He is always the hero, and often the\r\n     victim, of his own imagination; like a star actor, he cannot\r\n     bear to be outshone; he is morbidly, almost pruriently,\r\n     conscious of the effect he is producing. And on all matters\r\n     of intellect and taste his influence makes for blatant\r\n     mediocrity. But he is not meretricious; at bottom he is not\r\n     by any means as superficial and insincere as he often seems.\r\n     He is one of those men in whom an instinct becomes an\r\n     immutable truth, an idea a conviction, and a suspicion a\r\n     certainty, by an almost instantaneous process; and, the\r\n     process completed, action follows forthwith. The Kaiser is\r\n     always resolved to do the right thing; the right thing, by\r\n     some quaint but invariable coincidence, is whatever he is\r\n     resolved to do.\"\r\n\r\nThese appreciations from afar may be as sound as they are brilliant,\r\nbut they rather refer to the non-essential parts of the character of\r\nthe Emperor in the first flush of imperial glory than to the essential\r\ncharacter as it has developed with the years.\r\n\r\nAs a man--he will be dealt with as monarch presently--his essential\r\ncharacter must be judged from his conduct, and conduct extending over\r\na good many years. One might say, conduct and reputation, but that\r\nreputation is so often the result of a confused mixture of superficial\r\nobservation, gossip, tittle-tattle, envy, hatred and uncharitableness,\r\nand, in the case of an Emperor, of merely picturesque and effective\r\nwriting.\r\n\r\nThere is another source which would materially help us in forming a\r\njudgment, but it is wholly wanting in the case of the Emperor. No\r\nprivate correspondence of his is, as yet, available to the world.\r\n\r\nAgain, a man's character is determined by his motives, if it is not\r\nthe other way about; in any case, a man's motives are for the most\r\npart inscrutable and can only be deduced from conduct, while the world\r\nusually makes the mistake of explaining conduct by attributing its own\r\nmotives. Tried, then, by the standard of conduct, the only one\r\navailable, the Emperor, as a man, shows us a high type of humanity. It\r\nmay not, probably does not, appeal to Englishmen wholly, but there are\r\nfeatures of it which must command, and do command, the respect of\r\npeople of all nationalities. And, first of all, he is a good man; good\r\nas a Christian, good as a husband, good as a father, good as a\r\npatriot. With all the power and temptation to gratify his\r\ninclinations, he has no personal vices of the baser sort. He is\r\nmoderate in the satisfaction of his appetites, whether for food or\r\nwine. He is no debauchee, no voluptuary, no gambler. He is faithful to\r\nold friends and comrades. He has high ideals, and is not ashamed of\r\nthem. He is neither indolent nor fussy; neither a cynic, nor an\r\nintriguer, nor a fool; he is neither wrong-headed nor stubborn; he is\r\nhonest and sincere to a degree that does him honour as a man, if it\r\nhas sometimes proved perilous and blameworthy in him as a monarch. He\r\nis optimistic, and on good grounds. He is no physical or intellectual\r\ngiant, but he is a man of more than average all-round intelligence and\r\ncapacity. If this appreciation is correct, or even approximately\r\ncorrect, it is a testimonial, whatever may be its worth, to great\r\nmerit.\r\n\r\nYet the Emperor as man has his failings and drawbacks, though they are\r\nsuch as time is almost sure to diminish or eradicate. Notably in his\r\nearlier years he lacked judgment, the power of balancing\r\nconsiderations and arriving at conclusions from them which men more\r\ngifted with poise would endorse as logical and inevitable. He does\r\nnot, like spare Cassius, see quite through the deeds of men, as his\r\nfriendship for Count Phili Eulenburg and the malodorous \"Camarilla\" go\r\nto show, and his choice of Imperial Chancellors, his grand viziers,\r\nhas not in every instance been happy. He has less tact than character,\r\nas he showed once in Vienna, where he greatly pained the Foreign\r\nMinister, Count Goluchowski, one day at a club by calling to him,\r\n\"Golu, Golu, come and sit beside your Kaiser.\" He has the German\r\nmasculine enjoyment in a kind of humour which would have delighted Fox\r\nand the three-bottle men, but would sadly shock the susceptibilities\r\nof an Oxford æsthete. He has a share of personal vanity, but it\r\nsprings from the desire to look the Emperor he is, not because he\r\nsupposes for a moment that he is an Adonis. He is theatrical in\r\nexactly the same spirit--the desire imperially to impress his folk in\r\nthe sense of the German word _imponieren_, a word that needs no\r\ntranslation. If he has lost much of Dr. Liman's \"romantik,\" he still\r\nretains the \"scatteredness\" of Mr. Sidney Brooks, though the Emperor\r\nwould rather hear it called \"many-sidedness.\" _En résumé_ he has the\r\ndefects of his qualities, but to no man or woman's unmerited loss or\r\ninjury, and if we weigh the good qualities with the bad, we find a\r\nfine balance remaining to his credit as a man.\r\n\r\nThe fierce light which beats upon a throne, if it is apt to dazzle the\r\nbystander, helps those at a distance, especially in these days of the\r\nstill fiercer light of modern publicity, to judge fairly the throne's\r\noccupant. The character of the Emperor as monarch ought, therefore, as\r\nfar as is possible in the absence of archives marked \"secret and\r\nconfidential\" and yet lying in the ministries of all countries, to\r\ndisclose itself nowadays with reasonable clearness. Yet, even still,\r\ndifferent and conflicting opinions regarding it are to be gathered in\r\nGermany and out of it.\r\n\r\nIndeed, his own people are among the severest critics. One of them,\r\nProfessor Quidde, early in the reign, made an extraordinarily\r\ningenious, but quite unjustifiable, comparison of him to Caligula,\r\nwhich, though only consisting of classical quotations and making no\r\nmention of the Emperor, was seen by everybody to refer to him and has\r\ncaused discussion ever since. While many foreign critics have done the\r\nEmperor justice, others in turn have made him out to be arrogant,\r\nsnobbish, bombastic, superficial, incompetent, and insincere. To\r\nwriters of this class he is always the German War Lord, ready to\r\npounce, like a highwayman or pirate, on any unprotected person or\r\nproperty he may come across, regardless of treaty obligations, of\r\ninternational disaster, or of the dictates of humanity. One day they\r\nannounce he is planning the annexation of Holland in order to get a\r\nfurther set of naval bases, the next that he means to take Belgium to\r\nmake a road for his armies into France, a third that he is about to\r\nset at naught the Monroe doctrine and with his Dreadnoughts seize\r\nBrazil. All these things are conceivable and not impossible, but they\r\nare in the very highest degree improbable, and, as yet at least, ought\r\nnot to be considered seriously. To sensible and better-informed people\r\neverywhere he is a Prussian king of the best type, a sincere friend of\r\npeace, with a mania for pushing the maxim \"_Si vis pacem para bellum_\"\r\nto extremes, politically the most influential man in Europe, and, with\r\nall his faults, one of the greatest Germans of his time.\r\n\r\nThe character of the Emperor, as monarch, is reflected very largely in\r\nthe character of the Germany of to-day.\r\n\r\nGermany is optimistic, ardently desirous of peace, bent on worthily\r\nmaintaining the great place she has won, and deserved to win, among\r\nthe nations, and so materially prosperous as to make many Germans\r\ntremble at the thought that the prosperity may be too great to last.\r\nThis, however, is not to assert that in Germany everything is _couleur\r\nde rose_. There are not a few things in the Empire's social and\r\npolitical conditions which are antiquated or promise no good. Noxious\r\nas well as beneficial forces have been introduced into the social life\r\nof the country and are beginning to make themselves felt. German\r\nhome-life is ceasing to be the admirable and exemplary thing it was\r\nbefore the present era of class rivalry, commercialism, the parvenu\r\nand the snob. The idealism which made the Empire a possibility is\r\npassing away. There is need, and a general demand, for franchise\r\nreform in Prussia, and a change in the spirit of Prussian bureaucratic\r\nadministration would be acceptable, though it is, perhaps, hopeless to\r\nexpect it. The opposition in Germany between the monarchic and the\r\ndemocratic principle, if not more marked than it was twenty or thirty\r\nyears ago, is manifesting itself over a wider and perhaps deeper area.\r\nThe relations between capital and labour are far from satisfactory\r\nadjustment. Social democracy is yearly gaining fresh adherents, and if\r\nguilty of no political violence, is yet a constant source of danger to\r\ndomestic peace. The German middle class, that bourgeoisie which is the\r\nbackbone and strength of the Empire, is losing its Spartan simplicity\r\nand its content with small and moderate pleasures; and the national\r\nvirtues of thrift and self-denial are yielding to the temptations of\r\nwealth and luxury. Business credit is unduly stretched, speculation in\r\nland has attained disturbing proportions, and the banking world is in\r\ntoo many instances allied with hazardous or doubtful enterprises.\r\nNevertheless the country as a whole is sound, intellectually, morally,\r\nand financially.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to mention any of the greater tasks of imperial\r\nadministration to which the Emperor does not continue to devote\r\npersonal attention. He is the life and soul of the army and navy,\r\nthough it should not be forgotten that as regards the latter he has in\r\nAdmiral Tirpitz an executive talent worthy of his own directive. His\r\ninterest in the mercantile marine remains what it was when in 1887, as\r\nPrince William, he drew up an expert opinion which decided the\r\nHamburg-Amerika Company to build their fast ocean-going steamers at\r\nhome instead of abroad, and by the success of the experiment commenced\r\nthe modern development of Germany's shipbuilding industry. Indeed, his\r\nattention to the Hamburg line, familiarly known as the \"Hapag\" line,\r\nfrom the initial letters of its legal title, \"Hamburg-Amerika\r\nPacketfahrt-Aktien Gesellschaft,\" and to the Norddeutsche line from\r\nBremen, has given rise to the unfounded belief that he is heavily\r\ninterested in their financial success. Herr Albert Ballin, the\r\nDirector of the Hamburg line, though a Jew, is among his intimates and\r\nadvisers, and the Emperor is said to have caused umbrage more than\r\nonce to Court officials and the aristocracy by giving directors of\r\nboth lines precedence at his table. Without the Emperor's personal\r\nsupport it is probable that neither the firm of Krupp at Essen nor the\r\nsplendid shipbuilding yards at Hamburg, Bremen, Stettin and elsewhere\r\nwould continue to progress as they are doing. He neglects no\r\nopportunity of stimulating Germany's internal and external trade.\r\nHe is at all times ready to encourage the introduction of useful\r\nachievements of modern science and invention. And lastly, by\r\ntactful treatment of other German rulers, and a wise policy of\r\nnon-interference with their States, he is promoting a feeling of\r\nfederal solidarity.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's conception of his relations to the people remains to-day\r\nwhat he was brought up in and what it was when he mounted the throne.\r\nIn England, America, and France the people are the real rulers, and\r\ntheir monarch or president is their highest official servant and\r\nrepresentative. The idea is not perhaps constitutionally expressed,\r\nbut it is universally and deeply felt in the countries named. In\r\nGermany the opposite theory obtains--for how long it must be left to\r\nthe future to say. In Germany the Emperor is the real ruler, the\r\ngenuine monarch, and the people are his subjects, the country his\r\ncountry. Hence, while an English king in an official document or\r\npublic statement would not think of putting himself first and the\r\npeople or country second, the German Emperor's official statements and\r\nspeeches constantly repeat such expressions as \"I and my people,\" \"I\r\nand the army,\" \"my capital,\" \"me and the Fatherland,\" and a score\r\nmore; so that Anglo-Saxons and other foreigners acquire the impression\r\nthat the word \"my\" is no figure of rhetoric or pride, but a simple\r\nclaim of ownership or possession. And the official relation between\r\nmonarch and people is reflected in the people's ordinary life. To the\r\nforeigner it continually appears that the public are the servants of\r\nthe official, not the contrary, whether officialism takes the shape of\r\na post-office clerk, a tramcar conductor, a shop salesman, a\r\npoliceman, or a waiter. All these functionaries are the possessors of\r\nan authority which the citizen is expected to, and usually does, obey.\r\nThe explanation of such a state of things is a little abstruse, but an\r\nattempt may be made at giving it.\r\n\r\nThe period immediately preceding the reign of Frederick the Great was\r\na period of absolute monarchy in Germany, a system introduced from\r\nFrance, where Louis XIV had proclaimed the doctrine _L'etat, c'est\r\nmoi_, according to which the lives and property of the subject\r\nbelonged to the Prince, whose will was to be obeyed without question\r\nor demur. There were now four hundred courts in Germany in imitation\r\nof the Court of Versailles, and the smaller the principality the\r\ngreater the absolutism. Absolutism, however, required an army to\r\nsupport it; hence the establishment of standing and mercenary armies\r\nand the disuse of arms by the citizen. The result, to quote Professor\r\nErnst Richard's work on \"German Civilization,\" was that\r\n\r\n     \"the pride of the burgher and the peasant was broken. A\r\n     submissive servility hopelessly pervaded the masses, and\r\n     even the best had lost all social and national feeling, all\r\n     sense of being part of a greater body.... The luxurious life\r\n     and the arrogance of the ruling classes were accepted as a\r\n     matter of course, one might say as a divine institution.\r\n     Thus those traits of character, which had come to light\r\n     under the cruel stress of the Thirty Years War, fostered by\r\n     the rule of despotism and the worst vices, took deeper root.\r\n     To these belong that greed for social position, for titles\r\n     and the smiles of the great; servility towards those who\r\n     hold a higher position as bearers of official titles and\r\n     dignity, a fear of publicity, above all a rather remarkable\r\n     inclination to a peevish, petty, and sceptical attitude as\r\n     regards the knowledge and ability of others. The exaltation\r\n     of the position of the prince extended to his Court and his\r\n     officials, as well as to the nobility, which had long since\r\n     become a Court nobility.\"\r\n\r\nBut absolutism had to go with the changes in human thought under the\r\ninfluence of Rationalism, which brought with it the idea of the State,\r\nnot the absolute prince, as ruler. This idea was embodied in the\r\n_Rechtstaat_, or State based on law, which was introduced by Frederick\r\nthe Great, the \"first servant of the State.\" The State, he said,\r\nexists for the sake of the citizens. \"One must be insane,\" he wrote,\r\n\r\n     \"to imagine that men should have said to one of their\r\n     equals, 'We will raise you so that we may be your slaves, we\r\n     will give you the power to guide our thoughts according to\r\n     yours.' They rather said: 'We need you in order to execute\r\n     our laws, that you show us the way, and defend us. But we\r\n     understand that you will respect our liberties.'\"\r\n\r\nThe _Rechtstaat_ exists in Germany to the present day, the Emperor is\r\nat the head of it, and the people are content to live within its\r\nconfines. It is not, as has been seen, coterminous with the whole\r\nliberty of the subject, but is yet a vast bundle of rights and\r\nobligations which in public, and much of private, life leaves as\r\nlittle as possible to the unaided or undirected intelligence or\r\ngoodwill of the citizen. It is an exaggeration, but still expresses a\r\npopular feeling even in Germany itself--and certainly describes an\r\nimpression made on the Anglo-Saxon--to say that outside this bundle of\r\nlaws and regulations, which, clearly and logically paragraphed, orders\r\nto a nicety all the public, and many of the private, relations of the\r\ncitizens, everything is forbidden or discouraged by authority. Yet, as\r\nhas been said, the people are satisfied with it, and it must be\r\nadmitted that if it confines individual liberty within what to the\r\nAnglo-Saxon seem narrow limits, still, by directing the individual to\r\ncommon ends, it works great public advantage. It is in truth a very\r\nintelligent and practical form of Socialism, infinitely less\r\noppressive to the people than would be the socialism of the professed\r\nSocialist.\r\n\r\nIt left, however, the German caste system of Frederick's day\r\nundisturbed; as Professor Richard says:\r\n\r\n     \"The nobility retained its privileged position. It was\r\n     considered a law of nature that the noblemen should assist\r\n     the monarch in the administration of the State and as\r\n     leaders of the army; the peasant should cultivate the fields\r\n     and provide food; the commoner should provide money through\r\n     industry and commerce.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Anglo-Saxon, of course, brought up with individualistic views\r\nof life and demanding complete personal freedom, the German\r\n_Rechtstaat_ would be galling, not to say intolerable. The Englishman,\r\nhowever, has his _Rechtstaat_ too, but the limits it places on his\r\nliberty are not nearly so restrictive in regard to public meeting,\r\npublic talking, public writing, in short, public action of all sorts,\r\nas in Germany. Besides, the spirit of laws in England, as naturally\r\nfollows from the Englishman's political history, is a much more\r\nliberal one than the German spirit, which is still to some extent\r\nunder the influence of the age of absolutism.\r\n\r\nThe German conception of the _Rechtstaat_ entails, as one of its\r\nconsequences, a sharp contrast between the rights and privileges of\r\nthe Crown and the rights and privileges of the people; and therefore,\r\nwhile the Emperor is never without apprehension that the people may\r\ntry to increase their rights and privileges at the expense of those of\r\nthe Crown, the people are not without apprehension that the Crown may\r\ntry to increase its rights and privileges at the expense of the\r\npolitical liberties of the people. To this apprehension on the part of\r\nthe people is to be attributed their widespread dissatisfaction with\r\nthe Emperor's so-called \"personal regiment,\" which, until recently,\r\nwas the chief hindrance to his popularity. In truth the Emperor is in\r\na difficult position. To be popular with the people he must be popular\r\nwith the Parliament, but if he were to seek popularity with the\r\nParliament he would lose popularity and prestige with the aristocracy\r\nand large landowners, who have still a good deal of the old-time\r\ncontempt for the mere \"folk,\" the burgher, and he would lose it with\r\nthe military officer class, which is aristocratic in spirit, and is,\r\nas the Emperor is constantly assuring it, the sole support of throne\r\nand Empire. In addition to this it has to be remembered that a large\r\nmajority of South Germany is Catholic, and, generally speaking, no\r\ngreat lover of Prussia, its people, and their airs of stiff\r\nsuperiority.\r\n\r\nThe personal relations of the Emperor to his people, and in especial\r\nto the vast burghertum, are precisely those to be expected from his\r\ntraditional and constitutional relations. He is not popular, but he is\r\nwidely and sincerely respected. His preference for the army,\r\nintelligible though it is, and the cleavage that separates Government\r\nand people, explain to some extent the want of popularity, using\r\nthat word in its \"popular\" sense; while the consciousness of all\r\nthe nation owes to his \"goodwill,\" his initiative and energy, his\r\nconscientiousness in all directions, is quite sufficient to account\r\nfor the respect. It is, in truth, in part at least, the respect which\r\nexcludes the popularity. No one is ever likely to be popular,\r\nanywhere, who is constantly endeavouring to teach people how to live\r\nand what to think, and at the same time seems to have no social\r\nweaknesses to reconcile him with those--no small number--who are fond\r\nof cakes and ale. Some of the Emperor's acts and speeches have\r\npostponed, if not precluded, eventual popularity--his breach with\r\nBismarck, for example, the whole \"personal regiment,\" and speeches\r\nlike that at Potsdam in 1891, when he told his recruits that if he had\r\nto order them to shoot down their brothers, or even their parents,\r\nthey must obey without a murmur. Speeches of this last kind live long\r\nin public memory. In his dealings with his people the Emperor is\r\nneither arrogant--\"high-nosed\" is the elegant German expression:\r\n\"arrogant\" is no German word, Prince Bülow would doubtless say--\r\ntowards his subjects, nor are they cringing towards him, though this\r\nstatement does not exclude the excusable embarrassment an ordinary\r\nmortal may be expected to feel in the presence of a monarch. The\r\nEmperor himself desires no \"tail-wagging\" from his subjects, and\r\nthough there is something of the autocrat in him, there is nothing of\r\nthe despot.\r\n\r\nCertainly for the present, Germans, with rare exceptions, are\r\nsatisfied with him. They are prospering under him. The shoe pinches\r\nhere and there, and if it pinches too hard they will cry out and\r\nperhaps do more than cry out. They do not consider the Emperor\r\nperfect, but they forgive his errors, and particularly the errors of\r\nhis impetuous youth, even though on three or four occasions they\r\nbrought the country into danger. Monarchy has been defined as a State\r\nin which the attention of the nation is concentrated on one person\r\ndoing interesting things: a republic, as a State in which the\r\nattention is divided between many who are all doing uninteresting\r\nthings: Germans find their Emperor interesting, and that is a stage on\r\nthe road to popularity.\r\n\r\nThe imperial ego, which is quite consistent with the German view of\r\nmonarchical rule and conformity with the _Rechtstaat_, is specially\r\nadvertised by the pictures and statues of the Emperor which are to be\r\nfound all over Germany, to the apparent exclusion of the pictures and\r\nstatues of national and local men of distinction. The Emperor's\r\npicture almost monopolizes the walls of every public and municipal\r\noffice, every railway-station refreshment-room, every shop, every\r\nrestaurant throughout the Empire. Wherever it turns the eye is\r\nconfronted by the portrait or bust of the Emperor, and if it is not\r\nhis portrait or bust, it is the portrait or bust of one or other of\r\nhis ancestors. An exception should be made in the case of Bismarck,\r\nthe reproduction of whose rugged features, shaggy eyebrows, and bulky\r\nframe are not infrequent; statues and portraits, too, of Moltke and\r\nRoon, though much more rarely met with than those of Bismarck, are to\r\nbe seen, while those of Goethe, Schiller, Kant, Lessing, Wagner, or\r\nother German \"Immortal,\" are still rarer. Only once, or perhaps twice,\r\nin all Germany is there to be found a public statue of Heine--for\r\nHeine was a Jew and said many unpleasant, because true, things about\r\nhis country. The travelling foreigner in Germany after a while begins\r\nto wonder if he is not in some far Eastern country where\r\nancestor-worship obtains, and where one tremendous personality\r\novershadows, obscures, and obliterates all the rest. In truth,\r\nhowever, this is not the lesson of the imperial images for the\r\nforeigner. They teach him that he is in a country with a system of\r\ngovernment and views of the State different from his own, that the\r\nEmpire is ruled in a military, not a civic spirit, and that the\r\ncounterfeit presentment of the Emperor, always in dazzling uniform, is\r\nthe sign of the national acceptance of system, views, and spirit.\r\n\r\nA similar lesson is taught by the Emperor's speeches. In England the\r\nKing rarely speaks in public, and then with well-calculated brevity\r\nand reserve. In five words he will open a museum and with a sentence\r\nunveil a monument. The Emperor's speeches fill four stout volumes--and\r\nhe is only fifty-four. The speeches deal with every sort of topic, and\r\nhave been delivered in all parts of the Empire--now to Parliament, now\r\nto his assembled generals, now at the celebration of some national or\r\nindividual jubilee, now at the dedication of a building or the opening\r\nof a bridge. The style is always clear and logical, in this respect\r\ncontrasting favourably with the German style of twenty years ago, when\r\nthe language wriggled from clause to clause in vermiform articulations\r\nuntil the thought found final expression in a mob of participles and\r\ninfinitives. Metaphors abound in the speeches, some of them slightly\r\nfar-fetched, but others of uncommon beauty, appropriateness, and pith.\r\nThere is no brilliant employment of words, but not seldom one comes\r\nacross such terse and happy phrases as the famous \"We stand under the\r\nstar of commerce,\" \"Our future lies on the water,\" \"We demand a place\r\nin the sun.\"\r\n\r\nOn the English reader the speeches will be apt to pall, unless he is\r\nthoroughly saturated with Prussian historic, military, and romantic\r\nlore and can place himself mentally in the position of the Emperor.\r\nThe tone, never quite detached from consciousness of the imperial ego,\r\nhardly ever descends to the level of familiar conversation nor rises\r\nto heights of eloquence that carry away the hearer. With three or four\r\nexceptions, there is no argumentation in the speeches, for they are\r\nnot meant to persuade or convince, but to enjoin and command. They do\r\nnot contain any of the important and interesting facts and figures of\r\nwhich, nevertheless, the Emperor's mind must be full, and they are\r\nwanting in wit and humour, though nature has endowed the Emperor with\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it should be remembered that they are the speeches\r\nof an Emperor, not of a statesman. The speeches have no political\r\ntimeliness or object save that of rousing and directing imperial\r\nspirit among the people by appeals to their imagination and\r\npatriotism. Had the Emperor been actuated by the spirit of a Minister\r\nor statesman, he would have been far more alive to the fact than he\r\nappears to have been, that every word he uttered would instantly find\r\nan echo in the Parliament, Press, and Stock Exchange of all other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's fundamental mistakes, as disclosed by his speeches,\r\nappear to an Englishman to have been in assuming when they were made\r\nthat the Empire was in a less advanced stage of consolidation and\r\nsettlement than it in fact was, and in underrating the intelligence,\r\nknowledge, and patriotism of his people. From this point of view his\r\nearly speeches in particular sound jejune or superfluous. What would\r\nthe Englishman say to a king who began his reign by a series of\r\nhomilies on Alfred the Great or Elizabeth or Queen Victoria; by using\r\nstrong language about the Labour party or the Fabian Society; by\r\nappeals to throne and altar; by describing to Parliament the chief\r\nduties of the monarch; by recommending the London County Council to\r\nbuild plenty of churches; by calling journalists \"hunger-candidates\";\r\nby frequent references to the battles of Waterloo and Trafalgar? Yet,\r\n_mutatis mutandis_, this is not so very unlike what the young Emperor\r\ndid, and not for a year or two, but for several years after his\r\naccession. To an Englishman such addresses would appear rather\r\nill-timed academic declamation.\r\n\r\nYet there was much, and perhaps is still much, to account for, if not\r\nquite justify, the Emperor's rhetoric. The peculiarity of Germany's\r\nmonarchic system placed, and places, the monarch in a patriarchal\r\nposition not very different from that of Moses towards the\r\nIsraelites--a leader, preacher, and prophet. Again, the Empire, when\r\nthe Emperor came to the throne, was not a homogeneous nation inspired\r\nby a centuries-old national spirit, but suffered, as it still in a\r\nmeasure suffers, from the particularism of the various kingdoms and\r\nStates composing it: in other words, from too local a patriotism and\r\nstagnation of the imperial idea. Thirdly, the Empire had no navy,\r\nwhile an Empire to-day without a navy is at a tremendous and dangerous\r\ndisadvantage in world-politics, and the mere conception that a navy\r\nwas indispensable had to be created in a country lying in the heart of\r\nEurope and with only one short coast-line.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman is as loyal to his King as the German is to his\r\nEmperor, and England, as little as Germany, is disposed to change from\r\nmonarchy to republicanism. But the Englishman's political and social\r\ngovernor, guide, and executive is not the King, but the Parliament;\r\nbecause while in the King he has a worthy representative of the\r\nnation's historical development and dignity, in the Parliament he sees\r\na powerful and immediate reflection of himself, his own wishes, and\r\nhis own judgments. Moreover, with the spread of democratic ideas, the\r\nposition of a monarch anywhere in the civilized world to-day is not\r\nwhat it was fifty years ago. The general progress in education since\r\nthen; the drawing together of the nations by common commercial and\r\nfinancial interests; the incessant activity of writers and publishers;\r\nthe circulation and power of the Press--themselves almost threatening\r\nto become a despotism--such facts as these tend to change the\r\nrelations between kings and peoples. Monarchs and men are changing\r\nplaces; the ruler becomes the subject, the subject ruler; it is the\r\npeople who govern, and the monarch obeys the people's will.\r\n\r\nSuch is not the view of the German Emperor nor of the German people.\r\nTo both the monarch is no \"shadow-king,\" as both are fond of calling\r\nthe King of England, but an Emperor of flesh and blood, commissioned\r\nto take the leading part in decisions binding on the nation,\r\nresponsible to no one but the Almighty, and the sole bestower of State\r\nhonours. There are, it is true, three factors of imperial government\r\nconstitutionally--the Emperor, the Federal Council, and the Imperial\r\nParliament; but while the Council has only very indirect relations\r\nwith the people, the Parliament, a consultative body for legislation,\r\nis not the depositary of power or authority, or an assembly to which\r\neither the Emperor, or the Council, or the Imperial Chancellor is\r\nresponsible. It must be admitted that, while such is the\r\nconstitutional theory, the actual practice is to a considerable extent\r\ndifferent. The Emperor is no absolute monarch, even in the domain of\r\nforeign affairs, as he is often said to be, but is influenced and\r\nguided, certainly of late years, both by the Federal Council and by\r\npublic opinion, the power of which latter has greatly augmented in\r\nrecent times. Whether the Reichstag really represents public opinion\r\nin the Empire is a moot-point in Germany itself. It can hardly be\r\ndenied that it does so, at least in financial matters, since with\r\nregard to them it has all the powers, or almost all, possessed by the\r\nEnglish House of Commons in this respect. Where its powers fail, it is\r\nsaid, is in regard to administration; for though it deliberates on and\r\npasses legislation, it is left by the Constitution to the Emperor and\r\nhis Ministers to issue instructions as to how legislation is to be\r\ncarried into effect. The result is to throw excessive power over\r\npublic comfort and convenience into the hands of the official class of\r\nall degrees, which naturally employs it to maintain its own dignity\r\nand privileged position.\r\n\r\nTowards one class of the population, and that a highly important and\r\nexceptional one, the Emperor's attitude of unprejudiced goodwill has\r\nnever varied. Israelites form only a small proportion--about 1 per\r\ncent.--of the whole people, and are to be found in very large numbers\r\nonly in Berlin and Frankfurt; but to their financial and commercial\r\nability Germany owes a debt one may almost describe as incalculable.\r\nThere is a strong national prejudice against them in all parts of the\r\nEmpire, as there probably is in all countries, and it must be admitted\r\nthat the manners and customs of the lower-class Jew, his unpleasant\r\nand insistent curiosity, his intrusiveness where he is not desired,\r\nhis want of cleanliness, his sharpness at a bargain, his oily bearing\r\nto those he wishes to propitiate and his ruthless sweating of the\r\nworker in all fields when in his power, are all disagreeable personal\r\nqualities. There is also, as a concomitant of the nation's growth in\r\nwealth of every sort, and mostly perhaps to be found in the capital a\r\nclass of Jewish parvenu, remarkable for snobbishness, ostentation, and\r\naffectation.\r\n\r\nBut one must distinguish; and of a large percentage of the educated\r\nclass of Jew in Germany it would be difficult to speak too highly.\r\nGermans may be the \"salt of the earth,\" as the Emperor once told them\r\nthey were, but Jewish talent can with quite as much, perhaps more,\r\njustice be called the salt of German prosperity. And not alone in the\r\nregion of finance and commerce. Some of the best intellect, most of\r\nthe leading enterprise in Germany, in all important directions, is\r\nJewish. Many of her ablest newspaper proprietors and editors are Jews.\r\nMany of her finest actors and actresses are Jews and Jewesses. Many of\r\nher cleverest lawyers, doctors, and artists are Jews. The career of\r\nHerr Albert Ballin, the Jewish director of the Hamburg-Amerika line,\r\nthe Emperor's friend, to whom Germany owes a great deal of her\r\nmercantile marine expansion, is a long romance illustrative of Jewish\r\norganizing power and success.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor's friendship for Herr Ballin is obviously not entirely\r\ndisinterested, but the interest at the root of it is an imperial one.\r\nIn this spirit he cultivates to-day, as he has done since he took over\r\nthe Empire, the society of all his subjects, German or Jew, who either\r\nby their talents or through their wealth can contribute to the success\r\nof the mighty task which occupies his waking thoughts, and for all one\r\nknows, his sleeping thoughts--his dreams--as well. Accordingly, the\r\nwealthy German is quite aware that if he is to be reckoned among the\r\nEmperor's friends he must be prepared to pay for the privilege, since\r\nthe Emperor is neither slow nor shy about using his influence in order\r\nto make the more fortunate members of the community put their hands\r\ndeeply into their pockets for national purposes. A little time ago he\r\ninvited a number of merchant princes and captains of industry, as\r\nAmerican papers invariably call wealthy Germans, to a _Bier-abend_ at\r\nthe palace. When the score or so of guests were seated, he announced\r\nthat he was collecting subscriptions for some public object--the\r\nnational airship fund, perhaps--and sent a sheet of paper to Herr\r\nFriedlander Fuld, the \"coal-king\" of Germany, to head the list. Herr\r\nFuld wrote down £5,000, and the paper was taken back to the Emperor.\r\n\"Oh, this will never do, lieber Fuld,\" he exclaimed, on seeing the\r\namount. \"At this rate people will be putting down their names for £50.\r\nYou must at least double it.\" And Herr Fuld had to do so. A few weeks\r\nafterwards there was another invitation to the palace, and the same\r\nsort of scene took place. A little later still Herr Fuld got a third\r\ninvitation, and as an imperial invitation is equivalent to a command,\r\nhe had to go. When he arrived he noticed his fellow-industrials\r\nlooking uneasy, not to say sad. The Emperor noticed it too, for his\r\nfirst words were: \"Dear gentlemen, to-night the beer costs nothing.\"\r\n\r\nThroughout the reign Germany has made it her constant policy to\r\ncultivate friendly relations with the United States. Chancellor von\r\nBülow, in 1899, apropos of Samoa, said in the Reichstag: \"We can\r\nconfidently say that in no other country has America during the last\r\nhundred years found better understanding and more just recognition\r\nthan in Germany.\" This is true of the educated classes, professional,\r\nprofessorial, and scientific; but the ordinary European German, who\r\ndoes not know and understand America, still displays no particular\r\nlove for the ordinary American. At the same time he probably prefers\r\nhim to the people of any other nation. American outspokenness in\r\npolitics, for example, must be refreshing to minds penned within the\r\nlimits of the _Rechtstaat_. He sees in them, too, millionaires, or at\r\nleast people who come from a country where money is so abundant that,\r\nas many country-people still think, you have only to stoop to pick it\r\nup. When it comes to business, however, he is a little afraid of their\r\nsomewhat too sanguine enterprise, and is given to suspect that a\r\n\"bluff\" of some sort is behind the simplest business proposition. Much\r\nof this, of course, is due to ignorance heightened by yellow\r\njournalism, for as a rule only the vastly interesting, but mostly\r\nuntrue, \"stories\" regarding Germany printed in the yellow press come\r\nback to the Fatherland.\r\n\r\nThe German, again, is made uneasy by what he thinks the hasty manners\r\nof the Americans; he considers them uncivil. So, let it be admitted,\r\nthey sometimes appear to be to people of other nationalities; but then\r\nas a rule Americans who jar on European nerves will be found to hail\r\nfrom places where life, to use the American expression, is \"woolly,\"\r\nor too strenuous to allow of the delicacies of real refinement. The\r\nordinary idea of the German in Germany, held by the stay-at-home\r\nAmerican, is a vague species of dislike, founded on the conviction\r\nthat the American, not the German, is the salt of the earth; that the\r\nGerman regard for tradition makes them a slow and slowly moving race;\r\nand that the Emperor as War Lord--for he is almost solely known to him\r\nin that capacity--must be ever desirous of war, in particular wishes\r\nto seize a coaling-station or even a country, in South America, and,\r\ngenerally speaking, set at naught the Monroe doctrine. The Governments\r\non both sides, of course, know and understand each other better. In\r\nNovember, 1906, Prince Bülow publicly thanked America for her attitude\r\nat Algeciras, implying that it was due to her representative's\r\nconciliatory and reconciliatory conduct that the Conference did not\r\nend in a fiasco. \"This,\" said the Chancellor, \"was the second great\r\nservice to the world rendered by America; the other,\" he added, \"being\r\nthe bringing about of peace between Russia and Japan.\"\r\n\r\nA great deal of the increased intercourse between the two countries is\r\ndue to the personal endeavours of the Emperor. What his motives are\r\nmay be conjectured with fair accuracy from a general knowledge of his\r\n\"up-to-date\" character, the commercial policy of his Empire, and the\r\nevents of recent years. He has a whole-hearted admiration for the\r\nAmerican character and genius, so akin in many ways to his own\r\ncharacter and genius; and if he refuses to recommend for Germans\r\nsimilar institutions to those in States, federated in a manner\r\nsomewhat analogous to that of the kingdoms and States composing his\r\nown Empire, it is not from want of liberality of mind, but because\r\nthey are wholly opposed to Prussian tradition, because his people do\r\nnot demand them, and because he honestly believes that in respect of\r\ntopographical situation, climate, historical development, and race\r\nfeelings and sentiment, the safeguards and requirements of Germany are\r\nwidely different from those of America.\r\n\r\nAs a young man he naturally had very little to do with America or\r\nAmericans, though among his schoolboy playmates was a young American,\r\nPoulteney Bigelow, who afterwards wrote an excellent appreciation of\r\nthe fine traits in the Emperor's character. At the same time the\r\nEmperor himself has stated that the country always interested him, and\r\nrecent visitors bear out the statement fully. In 1889, a year after\r\nhis accession, he expressed his admiration for America, when receiving\r\nthe American Ambassador, Mr. Phelps. \"From my youth on,\" the Emperor\r\nsaid,\r\n\r\n     \"I have had a great admiration for that powerful and\r\n     progressive commonwealth which you are called on to\r\n     represent, and the study of its history in peace and war has\r\n     had for me at all times a special interest. Among the many\r\n     distinguished characteristics of your people, which draw to\r\n     them the attention of the whole world, are their\r\n     enterprising spirit, their love of order, and their talent\r\n     for invention. The predominant sentiment of both peoples is\r\n     that of affinity and tested friendship, and the future can\r\n     only strengthen the heartiness of their relations.\"\r\n\r\nMore than twenty years have elapsed since the words were uttered, and\r\nthe prediction has been fulfilled.\r\n\r\nScores of anecdotes, it need hardly be said, are current in connexion\r\nwith the Emperor and American friends. One of them is that of an\r\nAmerican, Mr. Frank Wyberg, the husband of a lady who, with her\r\nchildren, used often to visit Mr. and Mrs. Armour on their yacht\r\n_Uttowana_ at Kiel, there met the Emperor, and was invariably kindly\r\ngreeted by him. Mr. Wyberg was summoned with his friend, General\r\nMiles, to an audience of the Emperor in Berlin. Before going to the\r\npalace Mr. Wyberg went to a well-known picture-dealer in the city and\r\nbought a small but artistic painting costing about £1,000. He had the\r\npicture neatly done up, and carried it off under his arm to the hotel\r\nwhere he was to meet General Miles. As they were leaving for the\r\npalace the General asked Mr. Wyberg what he was carrying. \"Oh, only a\r\ntrifle for the Kaiser!\" was the reply. The General was horrified, and\r\ntried to dissuade his friend from bringing the picture, telling him\r\nthat the proper procedure was to ask through the Foreign Office or the\r\nAmerican Embassy for the Emperor's gracious acceptance of it.\r\nOtherwise the Emperor would be annoyed, he would think badly of\r\nAmerican manners, and so on. Mr. Wyberg, however, was not to be\r\ndeterred, and insisted that it would be \"all right.\" While waiting in\r\nthe reception-room for the Emperor, Mr. Wyberg unwrapped the picture\r\nand placed it leaning against the wall on a piano. By and by the\r\nEmperor came in, and almost the first thing he said, after shaking\r\nhands, was to ask what the presence of the picture meant. Mr. Wyberg\r\nexplained that it was a mark of gratitude for the kindness the Emperor\r\nhad shown his wife and children at Kiel. The Emperor smiled, said it\r\nwas a very kind thought, and willingly accepted the gift. The story\r\nhas a sequel. A day or two after a Court official called at the hotel,\r\nto get from General Miles Mr. Wyberg's initials, and after another few\r\ndays had passed reappeared with a bulky parcel. On being opened the\r\nparcel was found to consist of a large silver loving-cup, with Mr.\r\nWyberg's name chased upon it, and underneath the words, \"From Wilhelm\r\nII.\"\r\n\r\nAnother anecdote refers to an American naval attaché, a favourite of\r\nthe Emperor's. Dinner at the palace was over, and the attaché, wishing\r\nto keep a memento of the occasion, took his large menu card and\r\nconcealed it, as he thought, between his waistcoat and his shirt.\r\nUnfortunately, when taking leave of the Emperor, the card slipped down\r\nand part of it became visible. The Emperor's quick eye immediately\r\nnoticed it. \"Hallo! H----,\" he exclaimed; \"look out, your dickey's\r\ncoming down!\" The story shows the Emperor's acquaintance with English\r\nslang as well as his geniality.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor seems to take pleasure in displaying himself to Americans\r\nin as republican a light as possible, and when he desires the company\r\nof an American friend, stands on no sort of ceremony. The American's\r\ntelephone bell may ring at any hour of the day or evening, and a voice\r\nis heard--\"Here royal palace. His Majesty wishes to ask if the Herr\r\nSo-and-So will come to the palace this evening for dinner.\" On one\r\noccasion this happened to Professor Burgess. The telephone at the\r\nHotel Adlon in Berlin rang up from Potsdam about six in the afternoon,\r\nand there was so little time for the Professor to catch his train that\r\nhe was forced to finish his dressing _en route_. Or the invitation may\r\nbe for \"a glass of beer\" after dinner, about nine o'clock.\r\n\r\nIf it is a dinner invitation, the guest, in evening clothes, with his\r\nwhite tie doubtless a trifle more carefully adjusted than usual,\r\ndrives or walks to the palace. He enters a gate on the south side\r\nfacing the statue of Frederick the Great, and under the archway finds\r\na doorway with a staircase leading immediately to the royal apartments\r\non the first floor. In an ante-room are other guests, a couple of\r\nMinisters, the Rector Magnificus of the university, and perhaps a\r\n\"Roosevelt\" or \"exchange\" professor; and if the party is not one of\r\nmen only, such as the Emperor is fond of arranging, and the Empress is\r\nexpected, the wives also of the invited guests. Without previous\r\nnotice the Emperor enters, an American lover of slang might almost say\r\n\"blows in,\" with quick steps and a bustling air that instantly fills\r\nthe room with life and energy, and showing a cheery smile of welcome\r\non his face. The guests are standing round in a half or three-quarter\r\ncircle, and the Emperor goes from one to the other, shaking hands and\r\ndelivering himself of a sentence or two, either in the form of a\r\nquestion or remark, and then passing on. When it is not a bachelors'\r\nparty, the Empress comes in later with her ladies. A servant in the\r\nroyal livery of red and gold, on a signal from the Emperor, throws\r\nopen a door leading to the dining-room, and the Emperor and Empress\r\nenter first. The guests take their places according to the cards on\r\nthe table. If it is a men's party of, say, four guests, the Emperor\r\nwill seat them on his right and left and immediately opposite, with an\r\nadjutant or two as makeweights and in case he should want to send for\r\nplans or books. On these occasions he is usually in the dark blue\r\nuniform of a Prussian infantry general, with an order or two blazing\r\non his breast. He sits very upright, and starts and keeps going the\r\nconversation with such skill and verve that soon every one, even the\r\nshyest, is drawn into it. There is plenty of argument and divergence\r\nof view. If the Emperor is convinced that he is right, he will, as has\r\nmore than once occurred, jestingly offer to back his opinion with a\r\nwager. \"I'll bet you\"--he will exclaim, with all the energy of an\r\nEnglish schoolboy. He enjoys a joke or witticism immensely, and leans\r\nback in his chair as he joins in the hearty peal about him. When\r\ncigars or cigarettes are handed round, he will take an occasional puff\r\nat one of the three or four cigarettes he allows himself during the\r\nevening, or sip at a glass of orangeade placed before him and filled\r\nfrom time to time. When he feels disposed he rises, and having shaken\r\nhands with his guests, now standing about him, retires into his\r\nworkroom. A few moments later the guests disperse.\r\n\r\nConversation, both in England and Germany, sometimes turns on the\r\nquestion whether or not the Emperor will be known to future\r\ngenerations as William \"the Great.\" It is agreed on all sides that he\r\nwill not take a place among the mediocrities or sink into oblivion. We\r\nhave, though only negatively and indirectly, his own view of the\r\nmatter, if, that is, it may be deduced from the fact that he has more\r\nthan once tried to attach this _epitheton ornans_ to the memory of his\r\ngrandfather. At Hamburg in 1891 he desired a statue to the Emperor\r\nWilliam I to bear the inscription \"William the Great.\" The cool common\r\nsense of the cautious Hamburgers refused to anticipate the decision of\r\nposterity and placed on the pedestal the simple words \"William the\r\nFirst.\" In deference to the Emperor's well-known wishes, if not at his\r\nrequest, the Hamburg-Amerika line of steamers christened one of their\r\nocean greyhounds _Wilhelm der Grosse_. The mere fact that people\r\ndiscuss the question in his lifetime is of happy augury for the\r\nEmperor. Perhaps some other epithet will be found for him. \"Puffing\r\nBilly\" is one of his titles among English officers, taken from the\r\nname given locally to Stephenson's first locomotive. But history has\r\nmany ranks in her peerage and many epithets at her disposal--great,\r\ngood, fair, lionhearted, silent--_that_ the Emperor will not have--and\r\na host more. Maybe the greatest rulers were those whom history, as\r\nthough in despair of finding a single term with which to do them\r\njustice, has refrained from decorating. Timur, Akbar, Attila, Julius\r\nCæsar, Elizabeth, Victoria, Napoleon have no epithets, and need none.\r\nHowever, it is clear that a verdict on the Emperor's deserts is\r\npremature. Suppose him at the bar of history. The case is still\r\nproceeding, the evidence is not complete, counsel have not been heard,\r\nand--most obvious defect of any--the jury has not been impanelled.\r\n\r\nMore than half a century has passed since the Emperor was born. How\r\ntime flies!\r\n\r\n     \"Alas, alas, O Postumus, Postumus,\r\n     The years glide by and are lost to us, lost to us.\"\r\n\r\nBut not the memories they enshrine. It is, let us imagine, the night\r\nof the Emperor's Jubilee, and he lies in the old Schloss, still awake,\r\nreflecting on the past. What a multitude of happenings, gay and grave,\r\nthrong to his recollection, what a glorious and crowded canvas unrolls\r\nitself before his mental vision! The toy steamer on the Havel; the\r\ngames in the palace corridors, with the grim features of the Great\r\nElector betrayed, one is tempted to think, into a half-smile as he\r\nwatches the innocent gaiety of the romping children from the old\r\nwainscoted walls; the irksome but disciplinary hours in the Cassel\r\nschoolroom; the youthful escapades with those carefree Borussian\r\ncomrades at the university on the broad bosom of Father Rhine; the\r\nexcursions and picnics among the Seven Hills; the visits to England,\r\nits crowded and bustling capital, its country seats with their\r\npleasant lawns and stately oaks; the war-ships in the Solent, with\r\ntheir black mass and frowning guns, as they towered, like Milton's\r\nLeviathan, above his head.\r\n\r\nWhat a good time it was, and how rich in manifold and picturesque\r\nimpressions!\r\n\r\nThe canvas continues to unroll and a literary period opens--that age\r\nbetween youth and manhood, of all ages most passionate and ideal, when\r\nwe are enthralled and moved by what we read--by those studies which\r\n\r\n     \"_adolescentiam agunt, senectutem oblectant, secundas res\r\n     ornant, adversis perfugium ac solatium præbent, delectant\r\n     domi, non impediunt foris; pernoctant nobiscum,\r\n     peregrinantur, rusticantur_.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the Lohengrin period, when, filled with the ardour and\r\nimaginativeness of high-souled youth, the future Emperor was dimly\r\nthinking of all he would do in the days to come for the happiness and\r\nprosperity of his people, nay, of all mankind.\r\n\r\nAnother tableau presents itself. Life has now become real and the\r\nEmperor's soldiering days have begun--never to conclude! His regiment\r\nis his world; parades and drills, the orderly-room and the barrack\r\nsquare occupy his time; and would seem monotonous and hard but for the\r\nlittle Eden with its Eve close beside them.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor turns uneasily, for his thoughts recur to the painful\r\ncircumstances of his accession; but calmness soon succeeds as the\r\ncurtain rises on the splendid panorama of the reign. He sees himself,\r\na young and hitherto unknown actor, leaving the wings and taking the\r\nvery centre of the stage, while the vast audience sits silent and\r\nattentive, as yet hardly grasping the significance of his words and\r\ngestures, emphatic though they are. And then he recalls the years of\r\n_Sturm und Drang_, the growth of Empire in spite of grudging rivals\r\nand of fellow-countrymen as yet not wholly conscious of their\r\ndestinies, which one can now see constituted a whole drama in\r\nthemselves, fraught with great consequences to the world.\r\n\r\nBut we are keeping the Emperor awake when he should be left to\r\nwell-deserved repose. He has doubtless half forgotten it all; the\r\nBismarck episode is one of those\r\n\r\n     \"... old, unhappy, far-off things\r\n     And battles long ago\"\r\n\r\nof which the poet sings. One unquiet political care excepted, all the\r\nrest must be pleasant for him to remember--the rising with the dawn,\r\nthe hurried little breakfast with the Empress, the pawing horses of\r\nthe adjutants and escort in the courtyard of the palace; the constant\r\ntravelling in and far beyond the Empire; the incessant speech-making,\r\nwith its appeals to the past and its promises, nobly realized, of\r\n\"splendid days\" in the future--its calls to the people to arms, to the\r\nsea, to the workshop, to school, to church, to anything praiseworthy,\r\nprovided only it was action for the common good; the dockyards in Kiel\r\nand Danzig, with their noise of \"busy hammers closing rivets up\"; the\r\never-swelling trade statistics; and the proud feeling that at last his\r\ncountry was coming into her own.\r\n\r\nEven the sensation the Emperor caused from time to time in other\r\ncountries must have had a certain charm for him--endless telegrams,\r\nendless scathing editorials, endless movement and excitement. There is\r\nno fun like work, they say. The Emperor worked hard and enjoyed\r\nworking. It was the \"personal regiment,\" maybe, and it could not last\r\nfor ever; but while it did it was doubtless very gratifying, and,\r\nnotwithstanding all his critics say, magnificently successful.\r\n\r\nThose strenuous times are long over, and if strenuous times have yet\r\nto come they will find the Emperor alert and knowing better how to\r\ndeal with them. He has, one may be sure, no thoughts of well-earned\r\nrest or dignified repose--he probably never will, with his strong\r\nconception of duty and his interest in the fortunes of his Empire.\r\nStill, he is a good deal changed. Time has taught him more than his\r\nearly tutor, worthy Dr. Hinzpeter, ever taught him; and if his spring\r\nwas boisterous, and his summer gusty and uncertain, a mellow autumn\r\ngives promise of a hale and kindly winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nAbdul Aziz, 259.\r\n\r\nAbsolutism, 2, 295, 368 _seq_.\r\n\r\nAccession, date, I;
