But whatever may be\r\nthe compass of a dominion, whether it be a borough or an empire, no\r\ninfluence is more potent in shaping the character and destiny of the\r\ncommunity than the nature of its external relations. It was in the\r\nsingle-handed conflict with foreign powers, whether superior lord or\r\ninsidious rival, that the drapers and mercers, the smiths and butchers\r\nand weavers of every country town were forced, with a patriotism\r\nquickened by necessity, to meddle in matters of State and to concern\r\nthemselves about the public weal; their ardours were stirred by legends\r\nof an ancient freedom, while their political instinct was trained\r\nby incessant discussion of legal precedent and right; and in the\r\nstrain of perpetual taxation, in heavy burdens imposed upon a people\r\nwhose prosperity was new, uncertain, or shifting; above all in the\r\nstrengthening of certain forms of narrow municipal despotism born of\r\nthe struggle against external danger, they paid the price of a bracing\r\npublic discipline.\r\n\r\nBut there is another side of the town history which is not less\r\nimportant, and which is far more complicated than the question of its\r\nforeign relations and policy—that is, the problem of its own nature,\r\nof the spirit by which it was animated and the inherent resources\r\nof its corporate life. In the town a new world had grown up with an\r\norganization and a polity of its own wholly different from that of the\r\ncountry. Members who joined its community were compelled to renounce\r\nall other allegiance and forego any protection from other patrons. The\r\nchief magistrate set over its inhabitants must be one of their own\r\nfellow-citizens—“not a far dweller” unless in time of special need,\r\nsuch as war, and then only “by the pleasure of the commonalty.”[1]\r\nAdventurers from the manor-houses of the neighbourhood and strangers\r\nin search of fortune were equally shut out; and it was only when a\r\ncounty squire was willing to throw in his lot with the burghers, to\r\nturn into a good citizen and honest tradesman, and to prove his credit\r\nand capacity by serving in a subordinate post,[2] that he could hope to\r\nrise to the highest office. It is true that country folk were welcome\r\nto pay a double price for having a stall in the market, or a store-room\r\nin the Common House for their wool; while the impoverished knight\r\nmight come in search of a renewal of his wasted fortunes through the\r\ndowry of some rich mercer’s daughter. But otherwise the town carried\r\non its existence apart, in a watchful and jealous independence. Its\r\nway of life, its code of manners, its habits, aims, and interests,\r\nthe condition of the people, the local theories of trade by which its\r\nconduct of business was guided, the popular views of citizenship and\r\ngovernment under the influence of which the burghers regulated their\r\ncivic policy—all these things must be kept in view if we would gain a\r\nclear idea of the growth of the borough from within.\r\n\r\nThe way of thinking and acting of the new world of traders and\r\nshopkeepers and artizans lives again for us in a wholly new literature\r\nwhich first sprang up in England about the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury—in Books of Courtesy and popular rhymes as to the conduct\r\nof daily life. The first English manual of etiquette appeared about\r\n1430. Germany had had its book of courtesy more than two hundred years\r\nbefore, a set of rules composed for a distinguished society by equally\r\nfastidious writers, one of whom laments that his pen had been made\r\n“common” by writing about masters and servants, and explains that it\r\nwas never happy save in describing knights and ladies. In northern\r\nItaly a similar book drawn up in the thirteenth century had taken a\r\nvery different character. There the merchants and shopkeepers of the\r\ntowns, impatient of “new ceremonies” brought in from over the mountains\r\nwhich they deemed contrary to all the traditions of the traders of\r\nLucca and Florence and only fit for the degenerate Neapolitans, framed\r\nrules to suit their own needs and aspirations. The French followed\r\nrather later, at the end of the fourteenth century; and then last of\r\nall came the English experiment.[3]\r\n\r\nThe very appearance of such a book at this time is most significant.\r\nThe nobles had already their own literary traditions handed down\r\nfrom an older world; and in the ideal of chivalrous conduct which\r\nwas enshrined for them in the “Morte d’Arthur,” the Knights of the\r\nRound Table still served as a standard of social virtue and good\r\nbearing for the upper classes—a standard with which the burghers\r\nhad nothing whatever to do. But the new literature was for the\r\ntownsfolk themselves, and it bore on every line the impress of its\r\norigin. A growing sense of dignity and self-respect in the middle\r\nclass of traders and artizans wakened aspirations for polite manners,\r\nand intercourse with strangers abroad gave fresh stimulus to social\r\nambition. Englishmen who visited Flanders towards the end of the\r\ncentury were as much impressed by the Flemish manners as by the Flemish\r\nwealth: “they can best behave them and most like gentlemen,” was their\r\ncomment.[4] In England the new society, with no heritage of tradition\r\nand no recognized array of models in the past, had to create its own\r\nstandard of behaviour, to shape its own social code, to realize for\r\nitself the art of life. Compilers worked busily in the service of the\r\nmiddle-class aspirants. One book of courtesy after another was adapted\r\nfor the vulgar use. The “Rules of S. Robert,” the good Bishop of\r\nLincoln, whereby “whosoever will keep these rules well will be able to\r\nlive on his means and keep himself and those belonging to him,” were\r\nput into English in a brief form, after wearing a more courtly garb of\r\nFrench or Latin for three centuries.[5] A Latin treatise on manners\r\nwas translated for the unlearned by a writer who prayed for help in\r\nhis work from Him who formed man after His own image, from Mary the\r\ngracious Mother, and from Lady Facetia the Mother of all virtue.[6]\r\nSound codes of morals were put in the form of an A B C.[7] The right\r\nconduct of life, especially as it concerned polite behaviour, was set\r\nout in little songs “made for children young, at the school that bide\r\nnot long.”[8] Plain directions in verse pointed out the duties of\r\ngirls, of young men, of housewives, of wandering youths looking for\r\nservice. The rhymes are of the homeliest kind, with trite and prosaic\r\nillustrations taken from the common sights of the market-place, the\r\ntavern, the workshop, or the street with its wandering pigs and its\r\nswinging signs; it is in their very rudeness and simpleness that\r\ntheir interest lies. Meanwhile political and satirical songs which\r\nhad been so common in the foregoing centuries mostly died out of\r\nfashion and were heard no more, as the burghers, quickened into a new\r\nself-consciousness, began to be concerned for a time with matters\r\nnearer home.\r\n\r\nThese fragments of old speech and song lead us into the very midst of\r\nthe lanes and workshops of a mediæval town. They recall for us the\r\ncountless political and social troubles amid which the trader was\r\nslowly fighting his way upward, and which left their deep impress on\r\nhis character and view of life. A pervading suspicion, a distrustful\r\ncaution, are the ground-note of many a song. Rude proverbs of daily\r\nspeech, jingling rhymes of wise counsel, all are profoundly marked by\r\nthe narrow prudence of people set in the midst of pit-falls, to whom\r\ndanger was ever present, whether at the council chamber or at the\r\ntavern or at a friend’s dinner table, and among whom talk and clatter\r\nwith the tongue were looked on as an unspeakable indiscretion.[9] They\r\npicture a life anxious and difficult, whose recognized condition is\r\none of toil that knows no relaxation and no end, of hardship borne\r\nwith unquestioning endurance—a life amid whose humble prosperity\r\nfamily affection and the family welfare are best assured by having\r\none roof, one entrance door, one fire, and one dining table, and a\r\n“back door” is looked on as an extravagance which would bring any\r\nhousehold to ruin. After a man had lived hard and worked strenuously\r\nhe still stood in need of the constantly recurring warning against any\r\nbitterness of envy at the prosperity of a lucky dealer next door. The\r\nlimits of his ambition and his duty are bounded by rigid lines; and the\r\nstandard of conduct is one framed for a laborious middle class, with\r\nits plain-spoken seriousness, its sturdy morality, its activity and\r\nrectitude and independence, its dulness and vigilance and thrift. It is\r\nthe duty of good men to set their people well to work, to keep house\r\ncarefully, to get through any heavy job steadily and swiftly, to pay\r\nwages regularly, to give true weight, to remember ever that “Borrowed\r\nthing must needs go home.” They are not to ape their betters in dress,\r\nonly\r\n\r\n  “Be as pure as flour taken from the bran\r\n  In all thy clothing and all thine array.”\r\n\r\nWith one whom “thou knowest of greater state” there should be no\r\neasy fellowship, no dining or betting or playing at dice; above all\r\nthere must be no show of overmuch “meekness” or servility, “for else\r\na fool thou wilt be told.”[10] A practical religion adds its simple\r\nobligations.[11] Men ought to pay their tithes, to give to the poor, to\r\nbe strong and stiff against the devil. The prayer on awaking, the daily\r\nmass before working hours, the duties of self-control and submission,\r\nmust ever be kept in mind. For the trader indeed the way of virtue was\r\na narrow one and straight. Three deaths ever stand menacingly before\r\nhim. First comes the common lot, the mere severing of soul and body.\r\n\r\n  “The tother death is death of Shame,\r\n  If he die in debt or wicked fame;\r\n  The third death, so saith the clerks,\r\n  If he hath no good works.”[12]\r\n\r\nBut side by side with directions about mercy, truth, and fulfilling\r\nthe law, come other warnings—warnings about carving meat and cutting\r\nbread and dividing cheese, about a formal and dignified bearing, how\r\nto walk and stand and kneel, how to enter a house or greet a friend in\r\nthe street—all carefully and laboriously shaped into rhyme. In the\r\nnew sense of changing customs, of fashions that came and went with\r\nthe revolutions of society,[13] training and thought and conscious\r\nendeavour were called in to replace the simplicity of the old unvarying\r\nforms. Manners became a subject of serious anxiety. Throwing aside\r\nthe mass of tradition handed down from century to century, when every\r\nusage was consecrated by custom, and determined by immemorial laws as\r\nto the relations of class to class, the burghers, side by side with\r\nthe professional and middle classes all over the kingdom, were tending\r\ntowards the realization of a new social order, in which men were no\r\nlonger obliged as formerly to pass through the door of the Church to\r\nfind the way of social advancement, but might attain to it along the\r\ncommon high road of secular enterprise. The notion of the worth of the\r\nindividual man was none the less important for the homely and practical\r\nform given to it in their rude and untrained expression. No one, they\r\ndeclared simply, need be shamefaced, of whatever lowly position he\r\nmight come, for\r\n\r\n  “In hall or chamber, or where thou gon,\r\n  Nurture and good manners maketh man.”\r\n\r\nIn whatever society he might find himself, the humblest citizen should\r\ntherefore so order his behaviour that when he left the table men would\r\nsay “A gentleman was here.”[14] The practical divinity of plain people\r\neasily drew the graciousness of outward demeanour within the sphere of\r\nreligion, and “clerks that knew the seven arts” explained\r\n\r\n  “That courtesy from heaven came\r\n  When Gabriel our Lady grette\r\n  And Elizabeth with Mary mette.”[15]\r\n\r\nSince “all virtues are closed in courtesy and all vices in villany” or\r\nrudeness, the best prayer one could make was to be well-mannered, for\r\nthe virtues of a fine behaviour reached as far as thought could go.\r\n\r\n  “In courtesy He make you so expert,\r\n  That through your nurture and your governance,\r\n  In lasting bliss He may yourself advance.”\r\n\r\nThese books of courtesy show us one side of the great change that\r\npassed over society[16] when the mediæval theory of _status_ was broken\r\ndown by the increase of riches which trade brought with it, and the new\r\nchances of rising in the world through wealth. The yeoman might become\r\na gentleman by getting into a lord’s household, and “spending large and\r\nplenty.” The squire who would be a knight without the danger of bearing\r\narms need only go to the king’s court with his purse full of money. The\r\nman of letters, the merchant, the seeker after pleasure, whoever and\r\nwhatever a man might be, he could win neither degree nor worship “but\r\nhe have the penny ready to take to.”[17] When the acquisition of wealth\r\nor the passage from one class to another was practically impossible,\r\npoverty and a low estate might still be dignified. But as soon as\r\nfortune and position had been brought within the reach of all, the man\r\nwho remained poor might be looked on as idle or incapable. A new test\r\nof superiority was applied, a test of material prosperity, and by this\r\nmeasure the townsman was judged by his neighbours and naturally judged\r\nhimself. On all sides we find indications of the excited ambition which\r\nhad begun to stir in every class,\r\n\r\n  “Now every boy will counterfeit a knight,\r\n  Report himself as good as he.”[18]\r\n\r\nNew distinctions of rank and caste began to appear, and an aristocracy\r\nof energy and skill constantly recruited and invigorated made its\r\ninfluence felt in every borough, as public honour was attached to trade\r\nin proportion to the wealth which its followers could win. The wool\r\ntrade especially held a place of distinction in common esteem; and\r\npeople who took to the selling of cloth were supposed to “live like\r\ngentlemen” and rejoice in a really superior station.[19] More and more\r\nthe enriched burgher hastened to give proof that he had risen into the\r\nleisured class by donning the fine dress whose cumbrous folds bespoke\r\na sedate idleness and luxury, so that whereas “sometime afar men might\r\nlords know by their array from other folk, now a man shall stand or\r\nmuse a long throw which is which.”[20]\r\n\r\nAs the chance of rising in the world stirred in the trader a new\r\nambition, so it stirred too the sense of the power of knowledge. When\r\nthe writer of Piers Ploughman counts up the gifts of the Spirit that\r\nwere distributed among the commons at the descent of the Holy Ghost as\r\n“treasure to live by to their lives’ end,” and “weapon to fight with\r\nwhen Anti-Christ assaileth,” he carefully reckons in with the rest\r\nthe wit to use words skilfully as preachers and prentices of law who\r\nlive leally by labour of tongue, the crafts and “connynge” of sight by\r\nwhich men win their livelihood with selling and buying, the wisdom to\r\ntill and thatch and cook as their wit would when the time came; the\r\nart of divining and dividing numbers, and all such learning of the\r\nschools.[21] Already the workers of the town were reaching forward, as\r\nsome of their rough rhymes show, to a true love of learning.[22] Their\r\nzeal took very practical form. Side by side with the great movement for\r\neducation which was going on under the patronage of kings and queens,\r\nof archbishops and bishops, and great lords and ladies, humbler work\r\nwas taken in hand by burghers and tradesmen for the teaching of their\r\nown people.[23] The founding of free grammar schools all over England\r\nwas the work of the trading classes themselves. Sometimes the schools\r\nwere founded by Guilds.[24] Sometimes townsmen who had thriven in\r\nthe world remembered gratefully the place of their birth or their\r\neducation. “By some divine chance” a “teacher of grammar learning” came\r\nto live in Rotherham about the beginning of the fifteenth century, and\r\none of the town boys, Thomas Scott, who had been taught by him about\r\n1430, became in 1474 Lord Chancellor, and in 1480 Archbishop of York.\r\nIn 1483 he founded a college in his old home with a Provost and three\r\nFellows who were to teach freely any one who came to them. One was to\r\ngive lessons in grammar, poetry, and rhetoric; the second in music,\r\nespecially singing, playing, and broken song; and if possible these\r\ntwo were to be priests, or at least one of them. The third Fellow\r\nwas to teach writing and arithmetic to youths who were not intended\r\nfor the priesthood, but for trades and other employments; for among\r\nthe children of Rotherham, said the archbishop, there were many who\r\nwere “valde acuti in ingenio.”[25] In the same way bishop Alcock of\r\nRochester, the son of a Hull merchant, established a free grammar\r\nschool at Hull, where the master was to “teach all scholars thither\r\nresorting without taking any stipend or wages for the same, and should\r\nhave for his own wages £10.”[26]\r\n\r\nSo in one way or another the work of education went on throughout the\r\nfifteenth century—a work whose magnitude and importance have been too\r\nlong obscured by the busy organizers of the Reformation days, who, for\r\nthe giving of a new charter or adapting the school to the new system\r\nestablished by law, clothed themselves with the glory of founders and\r\nbore away from their silent predecessors the honour of inaugurating a\r\nnew world. Not only in the busy centres of commerce, but in the obscure\r\nvillages that lay hidden in forest or waste or clung to the slopes of\r\nthe northern moors, the children of the later middle ages were gathered\r\ninto schools. Apparently, reading and writing were everywhere common\r\namong the people,[27] and as early as the reign of Richard the Second\r\nthe word “townsmen” had come to mean people instructed and trained,\r\nand no longer ignorant rustics.[28] But the most remarkable thing\r\nabout the growth of the new grammar schools was the part taken in their\r\nfoundation by laymen—by the traders and merchants of the towns. The\r\ngreat benefactor of Sandwich, Thomas Elys, left provision in 1392 for\r\none of the chaplains of his chantry to serve as schoolmaster for the\r\ntown boys; and the son of a draper who had had his education in this\r\nschool afterwards founded a grammar school. Sir Edmund Shaa, goldsmith\r\nand once Lord Mayor of London, established a school at Stockport by\r\nwill in 1457, and appointed a chantry priest of the parish church,\r\nwho, being “cunning in grammar,” should “freely without any wages or\r\nsalary asking or taking of any person, except only any salary hereunder\r\nspecified, shall teach all manner persons, children and other, that\r\nwill come to him to learn as well of the said town of Stopford as of\r\nother towns thereabouts, the science of grammar as far as lieth in him\r\nfor to do.” And another London mayor, Sir John Percyvale, who had been\r\nborn close to Macclesfield, left money in 1502 to endow a free grammar\r\nschool there, because there were few schoolmasters in that country and\r\nthe children for lack of teaching “fall to idleness and so consequently\r\nlive dissolutely all their days.”[29] It seems also that the\r\nManchester Grammar School was first planned by a Manchester clothier,\r\nwho at his death left money for its foundation; and was completed in\r\n1524 by Hugh Oldham, Bishop of Exeter, a native of Oldham;[30] the\r\nchildren were to be taught “after the manner of the school of Banbury,”\r\nand inhabitants of the town were compelled to contribute to its support\r\nby being forced to grind their corn at the school mills—a custom which\r\nwas kept up till 1759.\r\n\r\nThe new movement marked the beginning of that revolution which was\r\nultimately to take education out of the exclusive control of the\r\nChurch and hand it over to the people themselves. Up to this time the\r\nprivileges and profits of teaching had been practically a monopoly\r\nof the clergy, and there was no possible competition save that which\r\nmight spring up between licensed and unlicensed teachers within the\r\necclesiastical order.[31] A document drawn up by order of the abbot\r\nof Walden tells how the clergy of the parish church there had taught\r\nsome children of the village the alphabet, and even more advanced\r\nlessons, without leave from the abbot, who claimed by the statutes and\r\ncustoms of the monastery a perpetual monopoly of teaching or licensing\r\nschoolmasters. A petition was made by the inhabitants in favour of the\r\npriests, and in consequence of this petition the abbot, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the townsfolk, graciously allowed that every priest of\r\nthe Church might (during the goodwill of the abbot and convent) receive\r\none “very little child” of each inhabitant, and might teach the child\r\nin “alphabete et graciis”[32] but not in any higher learning; a legal\r\ninstrument embodying this concession was drawn up by a clerk of the\r\nYork diocese, and signed with a beautiful notarial monogram which must\r\nhave cost him the greater part of a day to draw.[33]\r\n\r\nBut under the new state of things another element was brought into\r\nthe controversy. The town itself occasionally became the aggressive\r\nparty, and took the teaching straight out of the hands of the priest.\r\nAn order was made at Bridgenorth in 1503 “that there shall no priest\r\nkeep no school, save only one child to help him to say mass, after\r\nthat a schoolmaster cometh to town, but that every child to resort to\r\nthe common school in pain of forfeiting to the chamber of the town\r\ntwenty shillings of every priest that doeth the contrary.”[34] Burghers\r\naccustomed to manage their own affairs easily assumed the direction of\r\neducation, and the control of schools gradually passed from clerical to\r\nlay hands and became the charge of the whole community. In Nottingham,\r\nwhere there had been a grammar school before 1382 at which it would\r\nseem that a boy’s education cost eightpence a term,[35] a new free\r\nschool was founded in 1512, probably by the widow of a former mayor,\r\nand was put directly under the management of the mayor and town\r\ncouncil,[36] and as these apparently proved somewhat negligent in the\r\nbusiness the Leet jury constantly interfered in the most officious way\r\nin the government of the school and the choice and supervision of its\r\nteachers. “It will be a credit,” they said, “to have a good master and\r\na good ussher in one school.”[37]\r\n\r\nOf the intellectual life of the towns we know scarcely anything, and\r\nthere is perhaps not much to be known. Scholars naturally drifted away\r\nto the Universities or London, and the society of the borough was\r\noccupied with other matters than learning. In Nottingham, in spite of\r\nthe educational zeal of the jury, the first evidence we have of a town\r\nclerk who knew enough of the classics to quote a line of Vergil and\r\na line of Horace is in 1534-1545; while it is not till 1587 that we\r\nfind a clerk who had learned Greek.[38] On the other hand Bristol was\r\nevidently a centre of radiant light. An excellent education was given\r\nin its school, if we judge from the famous Grocyn, who was brought up\r\nthere and left the school in 1463;[39] and its society was adorned by\r\nmen of culture and wide intellectual curiosity. William of Worcester,\r\nthe enquirer after universal knowledge, a man of science who practised\r\nmedicine and cultivated his garden of herbs, as well as a man of\r\nletters, who at forty-three “hath gone to school to a Lombard called\r\nKaroll Giles to learn and to be read in poetry or else in French,”\r\nand to whom “a good book of French or of poetry” seemed as fine a\r\npurchase as “a fair manor,” might be seen in his later days at Bristol,\r\npractising the art of annalist, in which character he surveyed the\r\nwhole town and carefully measured it by paces from end to end.[40] His\r\nfriend Ricart, town clerk and historian, spent the twenty-seven years\r\nof his clerkship in writing his Calendar or Chronicle of 332 leaves in\r\nsix carefully arranged parts, the first three being devoted to history\r\nand the last three to local customs and laws, in which he carried the\r\nstory of Bristol through 3,000 years from the days of Brut to the reign\r\nof Edward the Fourth.[41]\r\n\r\nIt was inevitable that the purpose and theory of education should\r\nultimately be modified by the change of masters, as well as by the\r\nchange of manners, and already fervent reformers like Caxton began to\r\nlook beyond “the alphabet and humanities” and discuss training in the\r\nmysteries of the English tongue itself. Among the “fathers ancient” who\r\nshould command the reverence of scholars they counted the famous men of\r\ntheir own race and speech—men removed from them by but a generation\r\nor two—Chaucer “the father and founder of ornate eloquence,” Lydgate,\r\nthe maker of “volumes that be large and wide,” and Occleve; and it\r\nis touching to see men, on the very eve of the heroic age of English\r\nliterature, wistfully looking back to the vanished glories of their\r\ngrandfather days, when, as it seemed to them, all the “fresh flowers”\r\nof style had been reaped by this handful of ancient worthies, and\r\n“of silver language the great riches” stored away in their treasury,\r\nso that the painful toiler who came after in search of “the embalmed\r\ntongue and aureate sentence,” could now get it only by piece-meal, or\r\nat the most might glean here and there by busy diligence something\r\nto show that he had reverently visited the fields of the blest.[42]\r\nThe enlightened zeal of the learned indeed had still to wage a long\r\nwarfare with the pedants of the schools and the barbaric notions of\r\neducation that governed men’s minds; and the training vouchsafed to the\r\npoor boys of the fifteenth century was then and for many a century\r\nafterwards a rude and brutal one.[43] No doubt, too, the trader’s view\r\nof education, practical as it was, had a touch of unashamed vulgarity.\r\n“To my mind,” says the Capper in the Commonweal, “it made no matter if\r\nthere were no learned men at all,” for “the devil a whit good do ye\r\nwith your studies but set men together by the ears;” what men wanted\r\nwas “to write and read, and learn the languages used in countries\r\nabout us, that we might write our minds to them and they to us.”\r\nScholars, on the other hand, trembled at the results to civilization\r\nand knowledge of the crude ideals of the mere man of business, who if\r\nhe had his way would “in a short space make this realm empty of wise\r\nand politic men, and consequently barbarous, and at the last thrall and\r\nsubject to other nations; for empire is not so much won and kept by the\r\nmanhood or force of men as by wisdom and policy,[44] which is gotten\r\nchiefly by learning.” But whatever were their faults it was in the\r\nschools as much as in the council-chamber or shop that the revolution\r\nof the next century was being prepared; and the wide-reaching results\r\nof the spread of education in town and village were potent factors\r\nin the developement of a later England. “The fault is in yourselves,\r\nye noblemen’s sons,” wrote Ascham, “and therefore ye deserve the\r\ngreater blame, that commonly the meaner men’s children come to be the\r\nwisest counsellors and greatest doers in the weighty affairs of this\r\nrealm.”[45]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN MARKET\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOSE under the sheltering walls of the parish church we may look for\r\nthe market of a mediæval town, with stalls leaning against the building\r\nwhere possibly the first beginnings of trade had found shelter, where\r\nbefore any market was held the people of the neighbourhood assembled on\r\nfeast days and sold meat and bread at the church without fear of being\r\ncalled on for any payment for toll and stallage;[46] and in which,\r\nafter the community had been endowed with market rights, the rulers and\r\ngovernors of the market met, the guardians of its weights and measures,\r\nthe makers of its laws, the assessors of its tolls, the supervisors\r\nof its wares. There, while the national government was drifting in\r\nperplexity at the mercy of court factions, agitated by problems of the\r\nKing’s civil list, pensions to nobles, and the conquest of France,\r\nthe towns were rapidly sketching out their commercial system and\r\ntentatively laying down the main lines into which the national policy\r\nwas ultimately to be driven.\r\n\r\nThe market had long been kept out of view by its more showy predecessor\r\nthe fair—the offspring of an immemorial antiquity, whose very name[47]\r\nbetrays its origin in the ancient gatherings at feasts heathen or\r\nChristian, and reveals it as an institution derived from old tribal and\r\nnational usages. Gradually expanding in later times with the growth\r\nof the royal prerogative and necessities of commerce, and drawing\r\nto its miscellaneous gatherings strange merchants fetched from far\r\nand near, the fair had a brilliant history of its own; it had given\r\nbirth to universal commerce and watched over its growth; it became\r\nthe foster-mother of the Merchant Law; even now it still appears with\r\nthe lavish airs of an antique benefactor casting on the green its\r\nfaded gifts of holyday and merry-go-round and quack delights. But as\r\nlong ago as the fifteenth century the superannuated fair was already\r\nfalling into a slow decrepitude, and giving place to its successor,\r\nthe product of a later order of things.[48] For the market had another\r\norigin and might trace back its descent to the traditions of the\r\nRoman _municipia_, and claim the Roman Pandects for its sponsors, and\r\nshow itself fortified by customs and modes of administration handed\r\ndown to England with many another legacy from the laws of the Frankish\r\nkings.[49] With all its air of being the very work and possession of\r\nthe people, the market was by descent no popular or tribal right; it\r\nwas the king’s prerogative; its tolls and customs were regulated by\r\nthe authority of the Justices of the King’s Bench, and its prices were\r\nproclaimed by the king’s Clerk of the Market.[50]\r\n\r\nWhat kings could not themselves profitably enjoy, however, was\r\ngenerally to be bought at some reasonable price. The privilege of\r\nholding a market could be transferred as a franchise to a subject, and\r\nthe whole market system in England grew up by means of royal grants of\r\nmonopolies to individuals or to corporations. Between the years 1200\r\nand 1482, almost 5000 local centres of organized trade were established\r\nby grants of markets and fairs,[51] and the towns were naturally well\r\nto the fore in securing whatever bargains were being distributed. But\r\nthe origin of the privilege was always independent in theory of the\r\nordinary municipal franchises;[52] and in many important boroughs\r\nfreedom from the Steward and Marshal of the Household and the royal\r\nClerk of the Market was one of the last rights given to the people.[53]\r\n\r\nClosely connected with the right to hold a market was the right to keep\r\na Beam or Steelyard with its weights, a yard measure, and a bushel.[54]\r\nOn the day that each new mayor entered on his office, he received from\r\nhis predecessor the common chest, the town treasure, and the standard\r\nmeasures; and was required forthwith to send out his councillors to\r\nthe house of every shopkeeper, baker, brewer, or innkeeper, that they\r\nmight carry all bushels, gallons, quarts, yards, or weights back to\r\nthe Mayor’s house to be compared with the standard models and duly\r\nsealed.[55] Thenceforth it was his business to make war on spicers and\r\ngrocers who sold by horn or aim of hand or by subtlety deceived the\r\npoor commons, on brewers who used cups and dishes instead of lawful\r\nmeasures,[56] on drapers who measured after their own devices, on\r\nweavers who used stones and not sealed weights to buy their wool; even\r\nmerchants of the Staple and country squires and foreign dealers brought\r\ntheir wool to the “Trove” or Balance, with a fee for the “Fermour of\r\nthe Beme,”[57] as soon as general trade proved the inconvenience of a\r\nvariety of local weights, or of the primitive method of using stones\r\nwhich still survived in the fifteenth century, when a Yorkshire steward\r\nwrites to his master, “I have a counterpoise weight of the weight stone\r\nthat the wool was weighed with, and that ye see that the stone be kept\r\nthat the shipman brings.”[58]\r\n\r\nThus the market with its Beam and measures became the source and centre\r\nof an activity absolutely new—an activity which crowded the roads not\r\nonly with merchants and chapmen, but with the new race of carriers\r\nthat was created at the end of the fourteenth century to transport the\r\ndealer’s wares throughout the length and breadth of the country.[59]\r\nDealers and manufacturers gathered in groups round the central Cheap\r\nand its Balance with authentic sealed weights, and gave the names of\r\ntheir several trades to the alleys in which butchers or milksellers\r\nclustered together, or where spurriers and goldsmiths had their shops,\r\nand grocers, mercers, wool-dealers, and cloth merchants were ranged\r\nin ordered ranks round the Guildhall for the greater convenience of\r\nthe municipal officers. What the new movement meant we can see in the\r\nchange that passed over the face of English boroughs. The first sight\r\nof a mediæval town must have carried little promise to the visitor. We\r\nhave a lively picture of the state of Hythe given by the presentments\r\nof its reforming jury in the beginning of the fifteenth century, from\r\nwhich it is not easy to understand how the inhabitants ever made their\r\nway about the town at all. Streets were choked with the refuse of the\r\nstable, made impassable by the “skaldynge de hogges,” flooded by the\r\noverflow of a house, drowned by the turning of a watercourse out of\r\nits way or the putting up of a dam by some private citizen heedless\r\nof all consequences to the public road. Timber dealers cast trunks of\r\ntrees right across the street, dyers poured their waste waters over\r\nit till it became a mere swamp, builders blocked it up utterly with\r\nthe framework of their new houses, and traders made their wharves\r\nupon it. Not only the most thriving and respectable merchants, such\r\nas the Honywodes, but the butcher and swine-keeper as well, threw the\r\nwaste of house and shambles and swine-cote into the open street till\r\nthere was scarcely any passage left for the wayfarer; or established\r\na “hoggestok,” “which smells very badly and is abominable to all men\r\ncoming to market, as well as to all dwelling in the town,” say the\r\njury. There was hardly a street or lane which was not described as\r\n“almost stinking and a nuisance.” The “Cherche Weye” was occupied by\r\nthe pits of a skinner. “There was no carrying through Brokhellislane.”\r\nThe street by which the procession went on Holy Thursday, the day of\r\nperambulation of the town, could scarcely be traversed. Everywhere\r\ngates and bridges were falling to decay, ditches unrepaired, and hedges\r\novergrown; and one offender who had obstructed a road by neglecting to\r\nrepair the ditches found an easy way of escape from his obligations\r\nby a courtesy to the Bailiff—“the dyeing of two cloths that the said\r\nditches may not have to be repaired.” Worse still the Holy Well was\r\nchoked with refuse, and so was the well in West Hythe, and “the water\r\nin the cart of Geoffrey Waterleader by which the whole community is\r\nrefreshed” was equally obstructed and spoiled by the refuse of the\r\nbutchers’ shambles. It is no wonder that pestilence devastated Hythe in\r\n1412, as throughout the century it swept over one town after another.\r\nBut it has been calculated that even without the aid of pestilence the\r\nordinary mortality of a borough in the Middle Ages was almost equal to\r\nthat of a town during a visitation of cholera to-day. Even the first\r\nwell-meant efforts of Corporations to shut pigs out of their streets\r\nand banish wandering dogs, by levying fines from any inhabitant who\r\nhad an “irrational animal going about” in the churchyard[60] or the\r\nmarket, doubtless added to the dangers of pestilence by removing the\r\nonly scavengers known to the early borough.\r\n\r\nNor was this the condition of the smaller towns only. In Nottingham,\r\na thriving and prosperous borough, we read in the same way of\r\nstreets blocked with piles of cinders cast out smoking hot from the\r\nbell-foundry or the iron workshops, or with heaps of corn which the\r\nhouseholders winnowed, or as they said “windowed,” by the simple method\r\nof throwing it from an upper window or door into the street that the\r\nwind might carry away the chaff.[61] In the yet wealthier manufacturing\r\ncity of Norwich the market place was not yet paved in 1507, but a\r\njudicious order was issued that no one should dig holes in it to get\r\nsand without the mayor’s licence.[62] The very attempt to get access\r\nto a town was often not wholly free from peril. In 1499 a glover from\r\nLeighton Buzzard travelled with his wares to Aylesbury for the market\r\nbefore Christmas Day. It happened that an Aylesbury miller, Richard\r\nBoose, finding that his mill needed repairs, sent a couple of servants\r\nto dig clay “called Ramming clay” for him on the highway, and was in\r\nno way dismayed because the digging of this clay made a great pit in\r\nthe middle of the road ten feet wide, eight feet broad, and eight feet\r\ndeep, which was quickly filled with water by the winter rains. But\r\nthe unhappy glover, making his way from the town in the dusk, with his\r\nhorse laden with paniers full of gloves, straightway fell into the\r\npit, and man and horse were drowned. The miller was charged with his\r\ndeath, but was acquitted by the court on the ground that he had had\r\nno malicious intent, and had only dug the pit to repair his mill, and\r\nbecause he really did not know of any other place to get the kind of\r\nclay he wanted save the highroad.[63]\r\n\r\nAll this heritage of squalor and rough disorder however was no longer\r\naccepted without protest. Old abuses were brought to light and\r\ndenounced.[64] Towns were swept and garnished, stately market crosses\r\nset up, and new Guild-halls everywhere built with shops and stalls and\r\nstorage rooms for the traders. A new interest was awakened in the state\r\nof streets[65] and lanes and central squares when waggons and pack\r\nhorses began to struggle through the mire with their loads on market\r\nday. And as travellers multiplied—busy men intent on bargains, traders\r\nflocking to buy and sell, mayors and clerks of distant boroughs come\r\nto negociate a commercial treaty, men of law having the conduct of a\r\nnew charter, common earners—all travellers who no longer cared (and\r\nsome of them for very obvious reasons) to depend on the hospitality of\r\nmonasteries, the towns with one accord began to provide inns where, to\r\nthe greater profit of the community, such men might turn for shelter;\r\nand the more luxurious among them might discover good cheer which\r\ndemanded a grateful entry—“paid for our bed there, and it was well\r\nworth it, witness, a feather bed 1_d._”[66] Everywhere a new order\r\nreigned under the busy rule of the municipal officers, as they leased\r\nout the market stalls and sheds,[67] appointed the corresponding\r\npews in the church, allotted storage rooms in the Guildhall, issued\r\nlicenses to alien traders, and controlled the wayward will of the\r\nsellers by regulating their prices and their profits. Goods landed at\r\nthe wharves of a seaport were delivered up to the public porters and\r\nmeasurers of the Strand[68] employed by the town to unload vessels\r\nwith pulleys and ropes supplied at the common expense, and to carry\r\nthem to the appointed place for toll or for inspection; and the\r\ntown brokers—public officers sworn to make no private profit while\r\nthey held their posts—conducted bargains in the name of the whole\r\ncommunity,[69] freighted vessels, and measured cargoes of corn or\r\ncanvas or cloth. Before the mayor the endless officials of the market\r\nwere sworn—the clerk of the market who had to search and survey\r\nall victuals, the sergeant who carried the toll-box on market days\r\nafter the bailiffs,[70] the “leave-lookers,” the “decennaries,” the\r\n“prud’hommes,”[71] the butchers chosen to oversee the meat market,\r\nthe men appointed to control the sale of fish and poultry, the common\r\nweigher, and so on through the long and various list of officials.\r\n\r\nA vast system of ingenious and elaborate regulations[72] marked the\r\nlong effort of the townspeople to carry out in their new markets the\r\napparently simple end which lay at the heart of the democracy, that\r\nfood and necessaries of life both good and cheap should be within the\r\nreach of every man. According to the theory which still held its ground\r\nin the sixteenth century that “victual being a necessary sustenance\r\nfor the body should not be esteemed at the seller’s liberty,”[73] a\r\nfixed price was set on all provisions. Hence the Assize of Bread[74]\r\n(apparently quite neglected by the feudal lords[75]) and the Assizes\r\nof Beer and of Wine were secured by the towns, whether as a part of\r\ntheir market rights or as an independent privilege.[76] Victuallers\r\nwere closely watched lest in selling meat, eggs, butter, or oatmeal\r\nthey should take “excess lucre upon them, selling that is to say more\r\nthan 1_d._ in the shilling;”[77] innholders were allowed a penny of\r\ngain on every bushel of corn and a half-penny on every seven pounds of\r\nhay, so that if a man could buy a bushel of corn[78] for 2_s._ 8_d._\r\nhe was not allowed to sell it for 3_s._; tavern-keepers might have\r\ntwopence profit on a gallon of white or red wine, and on sweet wines\r\nbrought by Italian merchants, fourpence;[79] cooks must make their\r\nmeat “well seasoned and wholesome, and sell it for reasonable winning,\r\nand that they reboil nor rebake no meat in hurt of the King’s people;”\r\nwhile fishmongers—a class most important in the mediæval world, and\r\namong whom it was impossible to prevent the growth of the middleman,\r\nwere subjected to endless regulations.[80] In the unceasing effort to\r\nsave themselves from dearth or from fraud the poor commons had their\r\nauthorized protector in the Mayor—a protector who on entering office\r\ntook oath before the community not only to obey the King but also\r\nto serve the people, and to “keep truly correction on all bakers and\r\nbrewers and taverners and cooks and such like people.” No sooner was\r\nthe Mayor of Bristol installed than he was bound to call all the bakers\r\nof the town to the Guild Hall, to understand from them what stuff they\r\nhad of wheat, to counsel them in their buying and bargaining with the\r\n“Bagers” who brought corn to the town, and to decide on the size of the\r\nloaves. Then all the Bristol brewers were summoned before him, that\r\nhe might commune with them about the cost of malt, and decree a fixed\r\nprice which no brewer might evade or alter. In like manner he proceeded\r\nto set a price on wood “by his wise discretion,” and to order the hours\r\nof its sale; and he had to examine the colliers’ sacks, and to assure\r\nhimself that standard measures for coal were set in the proper places\r\nof the town. Further, throughout the year it was his duty constantly\r\nto watch that his ordinances were duly observed. Occasionally his\r\nwalk was extended along the river side, that he might keep an eye on\r\nthe timber trade and observe whether the great wood called Berkeley\r\nwood was discharged at one quay, and the smaller faggots at another\r\nlanding-place; and that he might from spring to spring watch prices,\r\nand see that there was small wood enough to supply the poor people with\r\nbundles at 1/2_d._ or 1_d._ kept at the “Back,” a waterside street\r\nwhere the merchants’ stores were piled. At divers times he went to\r\noversee the quality of the bread and try its weight (for which perhaps,\r\nas at Sandwich, he engaged a goldsmith who was liberally paid for his\r\nexperience at the scales); while at Christmas, or whenever there was\r\nholiday or a pilgrimage in the town, it was his business to make sure\r\nthat there was bread enough in the shops to supply all needs. And in\r\norder to know certainly that the brewers not only made good ale for\r\nthe rich but also a cheap small drink for the poor, on Wednesdays and\r\nSaturdays he was “used to walk in the mornings to the brewers’ houses,\r\nto oversee them in serving of their ale to the poor commons of the\r\ntown, and that they have their true measures; and his ale-konner with\r\nhim to taste and understand that the ale be good”[81]—a very necessary\r\ntask if we accept the picture given us in Piers Ploughman of the\r\ntypical beer-seller of his day—\r\n\r\n  “Yea, bawe,” quoth a brewer, “I will not be ruled,\r\n  By Jesus, for all your jangling after _spiritus justicie_;\r\n  Nor after conscience, by Christ, for I could sell\r\n  Both dregs and draff, and draw at one hole\r\n  Thick ale and thin ale, and that is my kind,\r\n  And not to hack after holiness; hold thy tongue, Conscience!\r\n  Of _spiritus justicie_ thou speakest much and idle.”[82]\r\n\r\nThe Nottingham jury a century or two later would have drawn the same\r\npicture. “Master Mayor,” they cry, “we beseech you to be good master to\r\nus, and see a remedy for our brewers, for we find us grieved with them\r\nall.”[83]\r\n\r\nNor did legislation stop here. The moment a trader came within reach\r\nof a town he became the object of universal suspicion lest he should\r\nbe a dealer travelling with an alert intention to outwit the public\r\nand force an artificial value in the market by some contrivance of\r\nforestalling or regrating or engrossing—that is of intercepting\r\ngoods on the way to market in order to buy them more cheaply; of thus\r\nbuying at advantage to sell at increased prices; or of keeping back\r\ngoods bought at wholesale prices in order to sell them later at a\r\nbetter value. A jealous watch was kept on him. He was not allowed to\r\ndo any business secretly or outside the proper limits, but “openly\r\nin the market thereto assigned,” and even there he was ordered to\r\nstand aside till the townsmen had come back from early mass and had\r\nfirst been served with such stores of corn and malt, of butter and\r\npoultry and meat as their households needed, and the bell struck the\r\nhour when he might take his turn for what was left.[84] And as he\r\nbought so must he sell only in the established and customary place;\r\nand food once displayed on his shelf or stall could not be taken out\r\nof the town unsold without leave of the bailiffs.[85] Any citizen who\r\nhelped a “foreign” merchant by buying or selling goods for him under\r\nhis own name lost his freedom.[86] Men who lived “upland”[87] were\r\nrejected from the society of privileged traders of the towns, and\r\nsharp distinctions such as we find at Worcester between the “citizens\r\ndenizen” and the “citizens foreign”[88] separated the folk within and\r\nwithout the walls.[89] In one borough strangers’ stalls in the market\r\nwere separated from those of the burghers[90] so that they might not\r\nhinder the townsfolk in their business; in another they were forbidden\r\nto carry their wares from house to house;[91] here they might not sell\r\ntheir goods with their own hands, there they must dispose of them\r\nwholesale, or forfeit their entire stock to the town if they attempted\r\nto sell by retail; elsewhere they had to wait for a given number of\r\nweeks after their arrival before they could offer their merchandise\r\nto the buyer; if for public convenience aliens were allowed to bring\r\ninto the market victuals[92] and a few other articles, the monopoly of\r\nall valuable trade was kept in the hands of the burgesses or of their\r\nMerchant Guild.[93]\r\n\r\nIt is however needless to multiply instances of monopoly. The system\r\nwas universal, and a curious attempt which was once made to establish\r\nfree trade at Liverpool died almost as soon as it was born. The\r\ncharter of Henry the Third contained the usual provision that members\r\nof the Guild alone might trade in the borough, unless by consent of\r\nthe burgesses, but in a new charter of Richard the Second for which\r\nhe was paid £5 this clause was left out and free trade practically\r\nestablished. No sooner however did Henry the Fourth appear in 1399\r\nthan the burgesses bought from him for £4 a fresh grant of privileges\r\nwith the former clause restored, and the old monopoly was consequently\r\nreasserted, till oddly enough an outburst of religious bigotry\r\nabolished trade restrictions; for seeing that the Liverpool Protestants\r\nwere shutting out Roman Catholics from their market, Queen Mary in 1555\r\nproclaimed anew the charter of Richard the Second and the right of free\r\ncommerce.[94] Sometimes a lively smuggling trade betrays the weak side\r\nof the monopolists’ position; as when Bristol claimed entire control of\r\nall ports and creeks as high as Worcester, and the only lawful trade\r\nleft to Gloucester was the shipping of supplies, mostly of corn, to\r\nBristol. The shippers of Gloucester saw their chance of a rich lawless\r\ntraffic; small boats quickly and easily laden and drawing little water,\r\nshot out of the channel by shallow passages where the bigger Bristol\r\nships could not follow them, and Irish vessels made their way direct to\r\nGloucester and escaped the heavy dues at the Bristol port; and while\r\nGloucester traders grew rich fast, the Bristol folk made complaint that\r\nthey were threatened with ruin.[95]\r\n\r\nThis elaborate system of trade regulation was no doubt mainly due\r\nto the effort which men were forced to make, as centres of thicker\r\npopulation grew up in a country where the carriage of goods[96] was a\r\nslow and difficult matter, to protect themselves from violent changes\r\nin the price of food;[97] while it is also possible that a society\r\nwhich dictated wages and profits was naturally drawn on to undertake\r\nthe corresponding duty of fixing the value in food and clothing of\r\nthese wages and profits. It would seem that for some centuries the\r\ncost of mere subsistence remained almost stationary; and even in\r\nexceptional cases, like the Jubilee of 1420 which brought a hundred\r\nthousand pilgrims to Canterbury, the corporation which had charge of\r\nthe preparations was able to ensure that there should be no increase in\r\nthe ordinary price of provisions.\r\n\r\nIt has been commonly held, however, that the old trade laws were not\r\nonly invented to protect the people’s food, but to protect wages\r\nand profits as well; and they have been denounced as the outcome of\r\nan ignorant selfishness; and as proving the belief of the mediæval\r\nburghers that the industrial prosperity of the whole community could\r\nonly be assured by their securing so complete a monopoly of the entire\r\ntrade of the borough that they might themselves reap all the fruit\r\nof their enterprise and gather wealth undisturbed—a belief to which\r\nmodern democracies (with one great exception) still cling, though\r\nthey throw a grander air over their creed now-a-days by discussing\r\nprotection in continents instead of protection in a little market\r\ntown. But it seems likely that protection in the modern sense had\r\nscarcely anything to say to the great mass of mediæval legislation\r\nabout trade. No doubt it was the natural ideal of every craft to have\r\nthe State for its nursing-mother; but the voice of the crafts was lost\r\nin the monotonous reiteration by the general public of their dominant\r\nprinciple, that manufactures and commerce only existed for the benefit\r\nof the whole community—the “poor commons of the realm,” to use the\r\nphrase of that day. It was for _their_ protection that no unlicensed or\r\nunregulated trade should be allowed to exist, that there should be no\r\nfraudulent manufactures, no secret breaking down of barriers set up by\r\nParliament for the orderly division and control of crafts, no buying\r\nand selling by forestallers, public enemies to the community and to\r\nthe country, hastening by land and by water to oppress the poor;[98]\r\nand rules devised to check a public mischief or secure a public good\r\nare no more to be classed as protective than regulations for the sale\r\nof drugs or the licensing of public houses in our own day. Such rules\r\nindeed were often as unsolicited by the trader as they were agreeable\r\nto the public, and all his cunning was exerted to elude them. Some\r\nlittle margin of profit was to be won beyond the city boundaries where\r\nthere was freedom from the city law and from the city tolls. Therefore\r\nthe London corporation complained that the butchers of London “who\r\nhave bought their freedom and are sworn of the franchise, do rent\r\ntheir houses at Stratford and round Stratford, and never come at any\r\nsummons nor bear their part in the franchise of the city; but shut\r\nout the citizens (resident butchers) in divers markets where they\r\nought to buy their wares, so that through them no wares they can get\r\nto the great undoing of the citizens.”[99] Bakers withdrew themselves\r\n“into the foreign” to avoid punishment for frauds.[100] Candlemakers\r\nestablished themselves in the suburbs, and butchers were presented\r\n“for selling of his tallow into the country and will not sell it to a\r\nman within the town,”[101] or for carrying tallow in sacks at night\r\nout of the city for the making up of candles; and being punished were\r\nordered to leave candle-making to the chandlers, who on their part were\r\ncommanded to keep within the boundaries. In Canterbury, where owing to\r\nthe great number of ecclesiastical tenants the main burden of taxation\r\nwas thrown on a part only of the population, and where doubtless taxes\r\nwere correspondingly high, there came a time at last when traders of\r\nevery kind, cloth-makers and brewers and bakers, carried their business\r\noutside the “liberties,” so that according to the story of the mayor\r\nand council “formerly there were divers and many habitations in which\r\nof time past were kept good and notable households, by the which many\r\nmen and women were relieved and had their living and increase, being\r\nnow uninhabited and greatly decayed, and some of them fall to ruin and\r\nutter destitution ... and it is well understood and known that the\r\nprincipal cause thereof” was this wicked device of the independent\r\ndealers, by which the tradesmen in the city who had to pay “tax,\r\ntallage, and other impositions,” could not compete with those outside\r\nand “have not the sale and utterance of their bread and ale, as they in\r\ntimes past have had, to their great impoverishing, and manifold hurt\r\nand prejudice to the commonweal of the said city.” The suburban bakers\r\nsold their goods to “divers and many simple and evil disposed persons\r\nof the city as well to Scots, Irish, and other, which in no wise will\r\napply themselves to any labour or other lawful occupations, but only\r\nthey live upon sale and huckstry of the said bread, beer, and ale, and\r\nfor that they have resorting unto them many vagabonds ... whereby many\r\nwell disposed persons be greatly annoyed and grieved.”[102] To restore\r\ntrade to its primitive simplicity a law was passed with clauses against\r\nthe mercenary Scotch and Irish, the troublers of the city’s peace,\r\nand dealers were forbidden to sell their provisions “to no inhabitant\r\nwithin the said city, but only to such persons as shall be thought by\r\nthe mayor and aldermen of good disposition and conversation.”[103]\r\n\r\nThe prejudice against unregulated trade was no doubt reinforced by\r\nthe hostility of the town dealer to competitors who throve at his\r\nexpense on illegal profits; but it was probably the governing body\r\nof the town which maintained the most serious opposition to all\r\ntraffic that depended on the cheating of the common treasury of the\r\nborough.[104] For no trifling part of the town revenue came, as we see\r\nfrom the Nottingham records, from fines paid yearly by non-freemen for\r\nthe privilege of holding a stall in street or market. In Canterbury\r\n“Tollerati” paid for the right of buying and selling during a limited\r\nperiod, and at the end of the time renewed the right by a fresh payment\r\nof what was called “Tolleration money”;[105] alien traders living\r\nwithout the liberties, there known as “intrantes,” took in Romney the\r\nname of “extravagantes.” Some towns shewed a jealousy of strangers,\r\ndictated no doubt by special circumstances; as in Preston, where the\r\n“Foreign Burgesses,” as distinguished from the “Inn Burgesses,” were\r\ndrawn from the country gentry and squires and some inhabitants of the\r\ntown,[106] and were merely freed from toll[107] for any goods bought\r\nfor the use of their families, but were allowed no other profits of\r\ntrade, and even though they were inhabitants had no right of common on\r\nmarsh or moor, nor could they join in the election of any town officer\r\nnor be themselves elected;[108] while even with these restrictions no\r\ntrader who lived outside the walls was admitted among them,[109] and it\r\nwas only in course of time that alien dealers were gradually allowed\r\non payment of a fine to set up stalls in the market-place and carry on\r\ntheir business under the name of “stallingers.” In general, however, an\r\nopen purse was all that was needed to commend a stranger; and if the\r\ncharge on it was sometimes excessive it seems to have been enforced\r\nmainly as a means of persuasion to enter the Merchant Guild.\r\n\r\nBut for whatever reason the regulation of trade was thought desirable,\r\nwhether to protect the consumer’s pocket or to fill the town treasury,\r\nit certainly was not intended to keep buyers and sellers at home, to\r\nhamper their enterprise, or to abolish competition. If protection and\r\nmonopoly were allowed to look big, they were never allowed to get\r\nseriously in the way of business. In theory and sometimes in fact iron\r\nchains might be flung across the King’s highway, bars thrown athwart\r\nthe river, and custom house officers set at the gate to levy toll and\r\nstallage.[110] But gates and bars and chains swung open everywhere\r\nbefore the trader “if he have the penny ready to take to;” the guilds\r\nenlarged their rolls for foreigners,[111] the towns granted them\r\ntheir privileges liberally. Since a man could hold citizenship in\r\nmore than one borough a speculator or merchant doing business in a\r\nlarge way might always circumvent the rules against foreign dealers\r\nby being made citizen in some convenient trading centre as well as in\r\nhis own town,[112] and so obtain power to carry on the business proper\r\nto an alien speculator with all the privileges of a resident burgher.\r\nEvery pedantic hindrance, indeed, was removed out of the way of his\r\nenterprise, for a very slight study of town records disposes of the\r\nidea that mediæval trade was ultimately governed by the formal laws of\r\nstatute books. Monopoly was broken through whenever it was advisable\r\nor convenient for special occasions. Bakers and victuallers who rose\r\nto municipal offices turned the assize of bread and the inspection\r\nof cooking houses and fish stalls into an idle tale. In the hands of\r\nmerchants the laws of buying and selling were manipulated so as to\r\ninterfere neither with the free circulation of goods nor with the\r\ninstinct of the dealer to buy in the cheapest market and sell in the\r\ndearest; and it was still left possible to carry food where it was most\r\nneeded, whether to supply a manufacturing centre such as Norwich or a\r\ncity which was rapidly doubling its population like London.[113] If\r\nthe law ordained that the forestaller was to be heavily fined for the\r\nfirst offence; for the second to lose his merchandise and be put in the\r\npillory; and for the third to be deprived of the freedom of the city,\r\nthe law was simply ignored, or some trifling fine was inflicted—a\r\npaltry sum which a prosperous trader might easily disregard.[114] In\r\nfact it would almost seem that the actual result of the trade laws was\r\nmainly to give the rich wholesale merchant an additional advantage over\r\nthe poor trader. Forestalling and regrating became the fashionable\r\nprivilege of town councillors and magnates who through their position\r\nand their wealth found it doubly easy to evade local ordinances, of\r\nLondon merchants who were buying all over the country to supply the\r\nneeds of the growing city, and of dealers on a large scale interested\r\nin the export trade; while the terrors of the law served as an\r\neffective deterrent to struggling hawkers and chapmen against meddling\r\nwith the profits won by more exalted speculators from a customary if\r\nillegal traffic.\r\n\r\nThe real foundation of free trade throughout the country, however, and\r\nthat which alone gave any value to local arrangements and individual\r\nprivileges, is to be found in the early town charters, where this great\r\ngift had a leading place. Almost the first boon asked for by a borough\r\nwas a grant which should make its burghers or its merchant guild quit\r\nof tolls and pontage, and stallage and lastage, throughout the whole\r\nkingdom, in fairs and throughout sea-ports, in lands on this and on the\r\nother side of the sea; and give them power to buy and sell throughout\r\nall England, within cities and without, all kinds of merchandise; with\r\nthe right to have stalls in other markets than their own without paying\r\nstallage, and to buy in such markets at all hours and not only those\r\nallowed to strangers. Each charter moreover had wrapped up in it a kind\r\nof “favoured nation” clause which gave to boroughs “such liberties as\r\nthe city of London hath”—a clause which seems to have been interpreted\r\n(at least as to one of its meanings) as implying the right for burghers\r\nto buy and sell in gross in another town than their own on other than\r\nmarket days, and that “they may have in this respect as much liberty as\r\nthe citizens of London.”[115]\r\n\r\nIn its wide and unstinted privileges a charter such as this—the grant\r\nof a king who was lord of all fairs and markets—expressed the whole\r\nspirit of free trade; at a word local monopoly and protection in its\r\ntrue sense were swept away, and every market in the country opened\r\nto any trader duly enrolled as a burgher or a member of the Merchant\r\nGuild. The question indeed still bristled with difficulties. As the\r\nking was constantly giving away or selling his rights, or part of his\r\nrights, over markets, there were innumerable cases when the special\r\ngrant to one town to hold a market without disturbance, and the more\r\ngeneral license to its neighbour to consider itself free of all market\r\ndues, were wholly irreconcilable; and the law held that no charter\r\nof freedom could interfere with any earlier rights granted to any\r\nother person or corporation to levy tolls on transport, on crossing a\r\nbridge, on entering a gate, on taking up a standing in the market, or\r\nthe like. In cases where two charters were found to bestow conflicting\r\nrights, therefore, the towns set their best lawyers to search out old\r\nevidences and records, and to claim the protection of judges of the\r\nKing’s Bench or of Parliament for the grant that boasted of the greater\r\nage.[116] The preliminary question of priority of rights having been\r\nthus decided, the next step was to remedy the dead-lock of business to\r\nwhich the two communities had been brought by means of formal treaties\r\nsuch as nations make to-day, in which the right to levy toll and custom\r\nwas probably used as systems of tariffs have been used in modern\r\nstates—as a means of bribing or threatening refractory neighbours\r\ninto some concession of free trade.[117] Southampton made its separate\r\ntreaties with at least seventy-three towns or trading corporations\r\nbesides all the “honours” of the kingdom, releasing them from payment\r\nof its tolls and customs; its burghers had their own compact with\r\nMarlborough[118] in which they waived such privileges as they possessed\r\nby their own earlier charter; with Bristol they settled the amount\r\nof the tax to be levied on Bristol men who brought merchandise to\r\ntheir market; they agreed with the men of Winchester that no tolls\r\nshould be asked on either side;[119] and in 1501 their treaty with the\r\nCinque Ports was ratified by “your lovers the bailiff and jurats of\r\nHastings.”[120] Undermined as they were on all sides, and with gaping\r\nbreaches everywhere, the walls of protection which the boroughs had\r\nthrown up round their markets certainly formed no impediment to the\r\nmovement of local trade. Before the impatience of traders greedy for\r\ngain, artificial frontiers and barriers and tariffs were swept away,\r\nand from little self-contained communities where the cottagers grew\r\ntheir own food and spun their own wool and asked scarcely anything\r\nfrom outside save fish and salt and a little iron, the boroughs grew\r\nrapidly into centres of expanding commerce. To supply their needs or\r\ntheir luxuries they despatched their traders far and wide. When Ely\r\nsent for John of Gloucester, the famous bell-founder, to make the four\r\ngreat bells for the cathedral, messengers had to go to Erith for clay,\r\nand to Lynn and Northampton for copper and tin.[121] The Nottingham\r\ngoldsmith was employed to repair the cross in Clifton Church, and its\r\n“alablaster man” supplied the faithful in London with little statues of\r\nthe Baptist in appropriate shrines.[122] Buyers of wool and sellers of\r\ncloth, saddlers, butchers, fishmongers, hawkers of all sorts, obtained\r\nfrom the mayor and commonalty of their borough letters of free passage\r\nthroughout the kingdom for the carrying on of their business[123] and\r\nkept up incessant intercourse between town and town. Everywhere busy\r\nforestallers were on the look out for eggs and meat and corn, and\r\nbought up supplies all over the country for London or some big town or\r\nfor the export trade, or turned their privileges under the clause of\r\nLondon liberties into a means of buying wholesale all the week long as\r\nregrators in order to sell at a profit on market day, while on that day\r\nitself they were out at cock-crow to buy privately when the citizens\r\nwere at mass, so that by six o’clock there was nothing left in the\r\nmarket for the good folk of the town.[124]\r\n\r\nAs we look at this mighty volume of commerce pouring from town to town\r\nwith a steady force that swept all obstacles out of its channel, we\r\nmay well begin to doubt whether the burghers of the middle ages were\r\nindeed stupidly putting their necks under a hard yoke of arbitrary\r\nlaw, and wilfully destroying their own prospects by preferring bondage\r\nto freedom, or sacrificing general prosperity to local greeds. The\r\nmediæval system, until it began to fall into the decay that precedes\r\ndeath, was in fact the minister to fine and worthy ends. In a society\r\nwhere few rights existed save by way of privilege, the trading\r\n“communitas,” whether the borough or the guild, did actually serve\r\nas the great engine for the abolition of restrictions, for extending\r\nprivilege, and throwing open a national commerce. There was a time\r\nwhen every new chartered association was an actual widening of free\r\ntrade; and a man entered the community of a town for the same reasons\r\nthat he might to-day take out letters of naturalization in a country\r\nwhere his business lay—not to be ensured against competition, but to\r\nshare in all commercial privileges which it had won by treaty, and\r\nin case of peril to own the protection of its flag. Each town had\r\nits own privileged “community” and recognized the “community” of the\r\nneighbouring borough; and it was by this mutual recognition only that\r\nintermunicipal treaties became possible, or that any borough could\r\nascertain the limits of its responsibility for members in foreign fair\r\nor market, could pledge itself to the fulfilment of its treaties, or\r\nhave any guarantee for redress in case of wrong.[125] In the detailed\r\nmunicipal legislation about debt and surety and mutual responsibility,\r\nabout punishment of violence, the suppression of an individual traitor\r\nto the common weal, the protection of a community from false dealing of\r\nany of its confederate states, we may plainly see how local monopolies\r\nhad come to be far more significant from the point of view of public\r\norder and general intercourse than of private wealth. Monopoly and\r\nprotection in fact had put on the garb of a necessary office and\r\nservice. Instead of gaolers who kept the trader fast bound at home,\r\nthey were the strong guardians who attended him as he went abroad,\r\nthe fore-runners who cut down before him the chains that barred the\r\nhighway, the ministers of justice that tracked out in his service the\r\nfraudulent debtor, the pledges to him in every danger of the vigilance\r\nand power of his native town. To each community they were the bonds of\r\na civil order and the tokens of a corporate fidelity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN TRADER\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the appearance of the new commercial society in the boroughs we\r\nfeel that the history of modern England has begun. By the formation\r\nof a prosperous middle class, a new type of character was introduced\r\ninto English life—a type which lay altogether outside old traditions,\r\nand was as far from imitating the confident superiority of classes\r\nthat held the mastery by traditional right, as it was from preserving\r\nthe simplicity and resignation of the masses of those who confessed\r\na hereditary duty of subjection. The mediæval burgher was trained in\r\na rough school. Owing nothing to class or family or patron, roughly\r\njudged and consigned to his own place in the ranks by the test of\r\ncompetition in its simplest form, the industrial rivalry between\r\nman and man, the trader had no helper if he did not help himself.\r\nMerchants burdened with little capital, like the trader pictured by\r\nHolbein in his Dance of Death carrying all their store of wealth bound\r\nup on their persons, and free to change their residence as often as\r\ncommerce offered brighter prospects elsewhere, wandered from town to\r\ntown, leaving no trade unlearned, no fair unvisited at home, and no\r\nmarket forgotten abroad. Craftmasters equally destitute of money had to\r\ntrust to their own wit in the struggle for life, and became practised\r\nin vigilance and patience, thrift and caution, in the contempt of\r\nhardship, in strenuous and ceaseless activity. The discipline of trade\r\nwas severe, and the conditions of prosperity hard. If a gentleman\r\nintruder appeared among these men hoping to find an easy way to wealth\r\nin the more respectable forms of business to which the county families\r\nalone condescended, his experiences were watched with contemptuous good\r\nhumour by the burghers, who knew the hardships of the road.\r\n\r\n  “I have made many a knight both mercer and draper,”\r\n\r\nsays the merchant in a mediæval poem,\r\n\r\n  “Paid never for their prenticehood not a pair of gloves;\r\n  But chaffered with my chevesance, [bargains] cheved [prospered] seldom\r\n        after.”[126]\r\n\r\nThe feeble and incompetent fell away before the severity of the tests\r\napplied, and the trading class was constantly undergoing change.\r\nPerhaps some sturdy Jewish stock, like the Phillips of Birmingham, held\r\ntheir own for three or four centuries;[127] but more commonly families\r\nspring up into importance and for one or two generations hold the first\r\nplace in the payment of taxes, and have control of the chief offices of\r\ngovernment, till after the third generation the name disappears from\r\nthe account books.[128] The family has died out, or broken down under\r\nthe stress of competition, or it has settled upon an estate bought in\r\nthe country and become merged among the county squires; and some new\r\nstock comes in to fight its way with fresh energy and enterprise.\r\n\r\nIn picturing to ourselves the life of a mediæval borough it sometimes\r\nhappens that, with our constant tendency to exaggerate the strangeness\r\nof the past, we perceive only an existence so straitened and humble in\r\ncondition that all sense of distinctions is lost, and we create a false\r\nmonotony, supposing that because in that remote world business was\r\ncarried on in a narrow sphere men’s fortunes were therefore more equal,\r\nor that the general level of commercial prosperity was necessarily\r\nmore uniform than it is now. But everything we know of town life,\r\nfrom the moment when the boroughs come into view, forces home the\r\nconviction of an inequality of circumstance and wealth as sensible as\r\nany that we recognize in the later Middle Ages; of a society which was\r\nat no time either simple or homogeneous, and where the plutocrat and\r\ncapitalist held as imposing a place and bore himself in as lordly a\r\nfashion, considering the limits of his stage, as his descendants of\r\nmodern times. The secret of wealth was first found, as it was long\r\nkept, by the butchers, brewers, and victuallers of one kind or another.\r\nThere were in every borough men like Andrew Bate, the butcher of Lydd,\r\nwho became “farmer of Dengemarsh,” and kept the town in a ferment\r\nfor years, whether with his herds of cattle which overran the marsh\r\npastures and trespassed on his neighbours’ fields or commons so that\r\nthey could not “occupy in peace,” and would rather sell their land\r\nthan be so “grievously hurted by the cattle of Andrew Bate;” or with\r\nhis heavy tolls for the “Western men” who came to dry their whiting\r\non the nesse, and found him a hard “extortioner” who “had driven away\r\nhalf Dengemarsh”; above all with his ceaseless activity in extending\r\nhis borders over the doubtful limits that parted the lands of the town\r\nfrom the lands of the Abbot; so that though the corporation in 1462\r\ninsisted on a careful marking out of their frontiers, and years later\r\nwere labouring to have him supplanted in Dengemarsh by another burgher,\r\nBate was evidently victorious, and ended by seeing his brother, who had\r\nbeen trained in the law probably with this object, appointed Town Clerk\r\nand practical controller of the affairs of Lydd.[129] In like manner\r\nthe rich fishmonger, Daniel Rowe of Romney, who sent his oysters,\r\ncrabs, lampreys, and trout to London, the eastern counties, Cambridge,\r\nand along the valley of the Thames as far as Wallingford, and fetched\r\nback in their stead boars, calves, porkers, and bacon, ended by being\r\nmade Town Clerk of Romney[130]—as indeed became an educated man, who\r\nkept his daybooks, where all the travelling expenses of men and horses\r\nwere carefully set down, in Latin. So also the Romney vintner, James\r\nTyece, who began life in a very small way in 1387, was important enough\r\nin 1394 to be sent on a deputation to the archbishop; in 1398 he was\r\nJurat, and in 1414 held so much land that his property was made into a\r\nseparate ward named after him in 1432.[131]\r\n\r\nIn short in every town the bakers, brewers, vintners, cooks,\r\nhostellers, and publicans “built their nests high” buying burgages\r\nout of the pence of the poor,[132] and in spite of law and ordinance\r\nwalked the streets in the furred mantles of aldermen, entered the\r\ncouncil chamber, kept the treasure chest as chamberlains—issuing\r\nprudent versions of the town accounts calculated for the public eye,\r\nand themselves regulating the assessments for taxes in the interests\r\nof their wealthy fellowship—and presided over the courts of justice,\r\nwhere they administered the assizes of bread and beer for the benefit\r\nof the fraternity; while for their services they required a part of the\r\ncommon land to be enclosed for their use, or pastured their flocks at\r\nthe public expense, and in a thousand ways gathered in for generations\r\nthe harvest that then ripened for men in authority.[133] No law could\r\nshut them out from the mayor’s seat; and carrying away from office the\r\nrobe of “clean scarlet” which gave them the chief places among the\r\npowerful members of “the Clothing,”[134] they still dominated over a\r\nhelpless people, with scarcely any check save from the jealousy of\r\ntheir fellow traders. Thus all Canterbury was disturbed in 1507 by\r\nthe brewer Crompe who, having been mayor for a year, returned to his\r\nformer business on leaving office, and went about busily canvassing\r\nthe small retailers, promising that if they would sell Crompe’s beer\r\nhe would be their “very good master whatsoever they had to do in the\r\nCourt Hall,” and that he would see to it that their pots should not\r\nbe carried off on charges of short measure to the Hall. In cases of\r\nthis kind remonstrance from the people seems invariably to have been\r\nperfectly useless, and the only complaint recorded in Canterbury was\r\nthat of the rival brewers, who met Crompe’s competition by an appeal\r\nto a custom of the town that the mayor should altogether forsake the\r\nvictualling trades; in the course of the half century there had been,\r\nit was said, at least six mayors who had “lived like gentlemen” for\r\nthe rest of their lives after leaving office, and though this polite\r\nprofession allowed them to carry on the business of drapers or cloth\r\nmanufacturers, it was proved that one ex-mayor who had been a brewer\r\nas well as draper left off his brewery and never returned to it;\r\nwhile another who was a baker sold his business, hired his house to\r\nanother man, and “lived after as a gentleman.” Crompe however remained\r\nobstinate, contemptuously protesting that the alleged “custom” was\r\nbut fifty years old (a bit of special pleading on his part since this\r\nwas just the age of the mayoralty itself in Canterbury) and, that the\r\nmayors had ceased to be victuallers out of self-indulgence, and because\r\nthey preferred to live at their ease.[135]\r\n\r\nAt the first victuallers and publicans owed their supremacy in the\r\ntown society to the fact that among a people needy and thrifty the\r\ntrader’s only way to fortune lay in selling the common necessaries\r\nof life. The great bulk of the people lived poorly. In general\r\nperhaps the master craftsman scarcely earned a higher wage than\r\nhis journeymen,[136] and may have often eked out his livelihood by\r\nploughing and reaping his lot of the common land at one time, while at\r\nanother he worked at his occupation with two or three helpers—servants\r\nand apprentices “which be of no great having,” and who were by law\r\ncompelled to cut, gather, and bring in the corn[137] if they were\r\nemployed in a trade “of which craft or mystery a man hath no great need\r\nin harvest time.” The first speculators who were tempted by visions\r\nof a great public with its exhaustless needs and unfathomable purse\r\npursued their dreams with the guile of petty schemers. If a dealer\r\nproposed to make his fortune in malt he opened proceedings with the\r\nstrictest economies. A penny or a half-penny served as earnest money to\r\nthe peasants from whom he bought his corn, and who were told to come\r\nto the house for payment. “And when they come there and think to have\r\ntheir payment directly, the buyer says that his wife at his house has\r\ngone out, and has taken the key of the room, so that he cannot get at\r\nhis money; but that the other must go away and come again soon and\r\nreceive his pay. And when he comes back a second time, then the buyer\r\nis not to be found; or else, if he is found, he feigns something else,\r\nby reason whereof the poor men cannot have their pay. And sometimes\r\nwhile the poor men are waiting for their pay the buyer causes the corn\r\nto be wetted,” and then tells the peasant he may take it away with\r\nhim if he does not like the price offered.[138] In the same way the\r\ncloth contractor started with a modest business that needed no outlay\r\nof money, taking the raw material which his customers brought to him\r\nand handing it over to weavers, who on their side provided their own\r\ntools and did the work in their own homes. As he prospered in the world\r\nhe may have become the owner of a few looms which he let out to the\r\nweavers he employed; or he perhaps added to his trade the keeping of a\r\nlittle shop or some small pedlar’s business for the sake of such petty\r\ngains as the law, looking in those days with scant favour on dealers,\r\nmight allow. Often hard set to carry on his business, he sought to\r\nhelp out his poverty by cunning, and the expedients to which he was\r\ndriven—the giving out of bad material or short weight to his workmen,\r\nthe devices to save a few pence here and there by deducting it on one\r\npretext or another from payments due, the giving wages in victuals or\r\nneedles or mercery or the waste trifles of his little shop—must often\r\nindicate the distracting pressure of immediate need under which he\r\nanticipated the devices of the small working employer of to-day.[139]\r\n\r\nBut from the earliest times it is evident that there were many of the\r\nmore successful traders who rose to a position which, in a humbler\r\ndegree, closely resembles that of our modern capitalists and employers,\r\nand that this class constantly tended to increase in wealth and in\r\nnumbers. They evidently rivalled in astuteness their brethren of\r\nlowlier fortunes.\r\n\r\n  “Ne had the grace of guile gone among my ware\r\n  It had been unsold this seven year, so me God help,”[140]\r\n\r\nthe merchant in Piers Ploughman admits frankly. His wife who made the\r\ncloth for sale was diligent in her sphere of economies, ordering her\r\nspinning women to spin the yarn out to great length, and paying for\r\nit by a pound measure that weighed a quarter more than her husband’s\r\nweighing machine—when he weighed true. At the draper’s he was taught\r\nhow to stretch out the list of the cloth, or to fasten rich pieces\r\ntogether with a pack needle, and lengthen them out with pressers till\r\nten or twelve yards reached to thirteen; and to get rid of his goods\r\nat Winchester and Wayhill fairs he carefully learned to lie and use\r\nfalse weights. To add to these resources he would go to the Lombards\r\nfor lessons in clipping coin and in lending money out at usury.[141]\r\nWeaknesses of remorse troubled him little.\r\n\r\n  “‘Repentedst thou never?’ quoth Repentance, ‘nor restitution madest?’\r\n  ‘Yea, once,’ quoth he, ‘I was y harboured with a heap of chapmen,\r\n  I arose and rifled their mails when they a’rest were.’\r\n  ‘That was a rueful restitution,’ quoth Repentance, ‘forsooth!’”\r\n\r\nNo age, indeed, has a monopoly of clever dealers, and every artifice\r\npractised in earlier days was familiar to the fifteenth century, and\r\nso loudly resented by the consumers, that many people, mistaking\r\nthe signs of a public zeal to check abuses for the evidences of a\r\ngrowing audacity in evil, have discovered in the later middle ages\r\nan accumulating mass of corruption which gradually covered with its\r\nblackness the felicity of a purer age.[142] But whether from “the grace\r\nof guile,” or from sheer ability, the traders prospered on every side.\r\nLangland looking out over all classes of men sees how with them above\r\nall lay the secret of fatness and good cheer:\r\n\r\n  “And some chose chaffer, they cheved [prospered] the better,\r\n  As it seemeth to our sight that such man thriveth.”[143]\r\n\r\nThe large sums that passed from hand to hand—the imposing debts\r\nregistered in the town accounts—the complaints of a master being\r\nin arrears to his apprentice for a sum of £100, or an apprentice to\r\nhis master for £138—the leasing out of the customs of a great port\r\nlike Southampton to a single merchant—all these things indicate\r\nthe new plutocracy that was beginning to appear.[144] Drapers and\r\nclothiers were admitted into the select circles of privilege; in the\r\ntowns the rank of “gentleman” became the appropriate reward of a\r\nsuccessful cloth merchant,[145] and even in the county society the\r\nclothier was beginning to oust the old proprietors. The Tames of\r\nGloucestershire were ordinary dealers who made cloth and traded at\r\nCirencester till about 1480 when John Tame rented great tracts of land\r\nat Fairford for his flocks of sheep, and in the new industrial centre\r\nwhich he developed there, wool was collected to feed the Cirencester\r\nmanufactory. All over the country he bought at a cheap rate lands\r\nwhich the ruined nobles could no longer hold; and his enormous wealth\r\nincreased yet further under his son Edmund, who took his place among\r\nthe “gentry” by becoming High Sheriff of Gloucestershire in 1505,\r\nreceiving the reward of knighthood in 1516, and entertaining Henry the\r\nEighth at his house at Fairford in 1520.[146]\r\n\r\nThe most wealthy folk in the towns, however, were probably the class\r\nthat had grown up with the developement of foreign commerce and the\r\nexport trade[147]—the merchants who forsook handicrafts and lived\r\nwholly by “grete aventour.”[148] Their lot was not altogether an easy\r\none in a society perplexed by the mighty rush of the new commerce,\r\nwhere men trained in an earlier system looked with a mixture of fear\r\nand dislike on the intrusion of a dubious profession not vouched for\r\nby familiar custom—“covetous people who seek their own advantage,”\r\nand who not only lay under suspicion as men who refused to work, but\r\nwere reproached with the destruction of trade by underselling the\r\ngoods of English artizans with cheaper foreign wares. The government\r\nwas concerned lest by their dealings the merchants should diminish the\r\nstock of gold to be kept in the country;[149] while, on the other hand,\r\nChurch and people unanimously saw in bargains with bills and pledges\r\nand sums bearing interest, which were then known as “dry exchange,”\r\nsomething not to be distinguished from the sin of usury, and called on\r\nthe government to declare void all such “damnable bargains grounded in\r\nusury, coloured by the name of new chevesaunce contrary to the law of\r\nnatural justice”—“corrupt bargains which be most usually had within\r\ncities and boroughs.”[150] To the delicate conscience of theologian\r\nor social preacher trade could only be defended on the ground that\r\nhonestly conducted it made no profit.[151] As for the “poor commons,”\r\nthey held that while a man might live by trading, and perhaps make\r\na modest competence, he had no right to grow rich;[152] his gains\r\nrepresented to the people the wages of iniquity, and the hungry toiler\r\nsitting over his mess of beans and bacon-rind comforted himself as\r\nbest he could with thoughts of the weary ages merchants must at last\r\ncount in purgatory, watching kings and knights and bishops pass out of\r\nits gates, while they themselves still lingered to pay the penalty of\r\ngreat oaths and innumerable taken\r\n\r\n  “Against clean conscience, for covetyse of winning.”[153]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile their way was made difficult on earth, and along the road to\r\nfair or market the wandering merchant or chapman was held to ransom by\r\nthe rustics, while the harmless messenger who travelled by his side was\r\nsent merrily on his road.[154]\r\n\r\nTo the mediæval mind indeed the merchant burdened with his goods was\r\nthe very type of the soul laden with sins, and painfully battling its\r\ndoubtful way to heaven. He passed from peril to peril in the transport\r\nof the packages on which he had set the sign that distinguished his\r\nwares, the tall cross with shrouds[155] or the flag. No navy protected\r\nhis vessels on seas that swarmed with pirates, and companies of ships\r\nas ready for battle as for commerce, set out together, under command\r\nof one of the captains chosen as admiral,[156] to fight their way as\r\nbest they could, while at home fear beset the owner on every side.\r\nIf a merchant sent his servant over sea to Bruges, or despatched an\r\napprentice to one of the Baltic ports to gather in the profits due to\r\nhim or to carry merchandise, no man might comfort him, and no religious\r\nthought distract his spirit till his messengers returned;[157] and\r\neven when his goods reached port all his experience and cunning were\r\nneeded to deal with the exactions of the king, who demanded the first\r\nchoice of his wine or precious cargo, or to baffle the rapacity of the\r\nofficers of the sheriff, the officers of the staple, the collectors of\r\ncustoms, the treasurers of the town, the searchers, or the clerk of the\r\nmarket.[158]\r\n\r\nIf, however, the risks of the merchant who dared the “great adventure”\r\nincreased a hundredfold, so the chances open to courage and skill\r\nbecame more brilliant,[159] and the triumphant trader became the object\r\nof national pride. London had its hero—\r\n\r\n                            “The son\r\n  Of Merchandy, Richard of Whittingdon\r\n  That loadstar and chief chosen flower\r\n  What hath by him our England of honour?\r\n\r\n  That pen and paper may not me suffice\r\n  Him to describe so high he was of prise.”[160]\r\n\r\nA brass in the church of Chipping Camden, dated 1401, commemorates the\r\n“flower of the wool merchants of all England.” In Dartmouth the long\r\nprosperity of the Hawleys[161] was recalled in the local proverb—\r\n\r\n  “Blow the wind high, blow the wind low:\r\n  It bloweth good to Hauley’s hoe.”\r\n\r\nThere were none who surpassed the merchants of Bristol—men who had\r\nmade of their town the chief depot for the wine trade of southern\r\nFrance, a staple for leather, lead, and tin, the great mart for the\r\nfish of the Channel and for the salt trade of Brittany, whose cloth\r\nand leather were carried to Denmark to be exchanged for stock-fish,\r\nand to France and Spain for wine; who as early as 1420 made their way\r\nby compass to Iceland; whose vessels were the first from England to\r\nenter the Levant; and who when calamity fell on their business by the\r\nloss of Bordeaux, and by the competition of London merchants and the\r\nconcentration of commerce in the hands of its Adventurers, turned their\r\nfaces to the New World; sending out in 1480, and year after year from\r\nthat time, two, three, or four light ships to sail “west of Ireland” in\r\nsearch of the “Island of Brasylle and the seven Cities,” till in 1496\r\nCabot started with five vessels on his voyage of discovery, whence he\r\ncame back to live in great honour among his fellow-townsmen, dressing\r\nin silk, and known as the “Great Admiral.”[162] The Bristol merchants\r\nof those days lived splendidly in fine houses three stories high, the\r\ngrander ones having each its own tower. Underground stretched vast\r\ncellars with groined stone roofs: the ground floor was a warehouse or\r\nshop opening to the street; above this were the parlour and bedroom,\r\nwith attics in the gables; while the great hall was built out behind\r\nwith a lofty roof of carved timber.[163] In the towers treasures of\r\nplate were stored which rivalled those of the nobles, and the walls\r\nwere hung with the richest tapestries, or with at least “counterfeit\r\nArras.” Perhaps it was some such house which suggested to the poet,\r\nborn perhaps in a village “cote,” and who knew Bristol well, the idea\r\nof an abode which might be offered to the Lord of heaven—\r\n\r\n  “Neither in cot neither in caitiff house was Christ y bore,\r\n  But in a burgess house, the best of all the town.”[164]\r\n\r\nBut the growing luxury of private life is a far less striking feature\r\nof the mediæval borough than the splendid tradition of civic patriotism\r\nand generosity which seems to have prevailed. Burghers who prospered\r\nin the world left their noblest records in the memories of their\r\npublic munificence; and there were hundreds of benefactors like\r\nThomas Elys, the Sandwich draper, who in 1392 founded the hospital\r\nof S. Thomas-the-Martyr, and endowed it with a messuage and 132\r\nacres of land; and within five months after founded the chantry of\r\nS. Thomas-the-Martyr;[165] or like Simon Grendon, three times mayor\r\nof Exeter, who left money to found a hospital for the poor. Gifts to\r\nchurches of plate and vestments and books, legacies for chantries or\r\nfor priests are too numerous to mention;[166] but there was a steady\r\ntendency among the townspeople to turn their benefactions into very\r\ndifferent channels, and bequeathing their money to the town corporation\r\ninstead of a religious body, to devote it directly to secular purposes\r\nand charities of the new fashion—founding free schools, building\r\nwalls, repairing bridges, maintaining harbours for their borough, or\r\nleaving a fund for the payment of the ferm rent or certain fixed taxes.\r\nAn Abingdon merchant gave a thousand marks towards the bridges over\r\nthe two dangerous fords, Borough Ford and Culham Ford, which had to\r\nbe built by the Abingdon men “at their own cost and charges, the alms\r\nof the town, and the benevolence of well-disposed persons,” and which\r\nwere to make Abingdon the high road from Gloucester to London.[167]\r\nIn 1421, when the Friars who owned the sources from which Southampton\r\nhad its supply of water could no longer afford to replace the decayed\r\npipes, a burgher “for the good of his soul” left money for new leaden\r\npipes sufficient for the whole town as well as for the friars.[168]\r\nAn Ipswich burgess gave the very considerable sum of £140 to relieve\r\nhis fellow-townsmen of certain yearly tolls;[169] and money was always\r\nforthcoming for gates and walls and market crosses, for the buying of\r\nnew charters, the adorning of the Town Hall, or gifts of plate to the\r\ncorporation;[170] while as we have seen, a new system of education was\r\npractically founded by the free schools which were so largely endowed\r\nby their liberality.\r\n\r\nFor the first time in fact since the expulsion of the Jews from England\r\nwe find a class of men with money to dispose of; for whatever gold\r\nand silver was available for practical purposes was gathered into\r\nthe coffers of the burghers. The noble “wasters” who with gluttony\r\ndestroyed what plougher and sower won[171] carried a light purse; while\r\ntimid country-folk, terrified by the disorder and insecurity of the\r\ntimes, unused to commerce and speculation, buried their treasures in\r\nthe earth, or laid away bags of “old nobles” with their plate in safe\r\nhiding places,[172] industriously hoarding against the evil day that\r\nhaunted their imagination. But among spendthrifts and faint-hearted\r\neconomists the burghers came with habits of large winnings and generous\r\noutgoings. They became the usurers and money-lenders of the age. When\r\nthe county families had exhausted all possibilities of borrowing from\r\ntheir cousins and neighbours[173] they had to turn to the shopkeepers\r\nof the nearest town, who seem to have been willing to make special\r\nand private arrangements on better terms than those of the common\r\nusurer.[174] John Paston borrowed from the sheriff of London; Sir\r\nWilliam Parr pawned his plate to a London fishmonger for £120, which\r\nhe was to pay over to him in the church of S. Mary-on-the-Hill beside\r\nBillingsgate.[175] From Richard the Second onwards kings borrowed as\r\nreadily as their subjects from the drapers and mercers of the towns.\r\nThe prosperous merchant in his prouder moments matched his substantial\r\nmerits against the haughty pretensions of lords who could go about\r\nbegging of burgesses in towns and be “not the better of a bean though\r\nthey borrow ever,”[176] and was not without an occasional touch of\r\ndisdain for aristocratic poverty. Sir William Plumpton married the\r\ndaughter of a citizen and merchant of York, who out of her rich dowry\r\nof houses in Ripon and York was able to leave large fortunes to her\r\nchildren. One of these wrote a description of a visit she paid to the\r\nhouse of some aristocratic cousins, Sir John Scrope and his daughter\r\nMistress Darcy, and of their supercilious bearing. “By my troth I stood\r\nthere a large hour, and yet I might neither see Lord nor Lady ... and\r\nyet I had five men in a suit (of livery). There is no such five men in\r\n_his_ house, I dare say.”[177]\r\n\r\nBut the constant fusion of classes which went on steadily throughout\r\nthe century showed how solid were the reasons which drew together the\r\nrich traders of the towns and the half bankrupt families of the county.\r\nImpoverished country gentry were tempted by the money made in business,\r\njust as the “merchants and new gentlemen” hoped to reach distinction\r\nby marriage into landed families. Squires built for themselves houses\r\nin the neighbouring boroughs, turned into traders on their own account,\r\nand commonly took office at last in the municipal government;[178]\r\nwhile on the other hand successful city merchants were becoming landed\r\nproprietors all over the country, were decorated with the ornaments of\r\nthe Bath, and distinguished by fashionable marriages,[179] in spite\r\nof the fretful sarcasms of a “gentle” class consoled in the hard\r\nnecessities of poverty by a faint pride. “Merchants or new gentlemen I\r\ndeem will proffer large,” Edmund Paston wrote when a marriage of one\r\nof his family was in question; “well I wot if ye depart to London ye\r\nshall have proffers large.”[180] He seems to have preferred that the\r\nPastons should look out for good connections; and possibly this anxiety\r\nwas especially present in the case of the women, for the family seem\r\nto have been rather excited when Margery Paston in 1449 married one\r\nRichard Calle, and went, as John said, “to sell candles and mustard in\r\nFramlingham.”[181] But John Paston felt no hesitation about marrying\r\nthe daughter of a London draper. One brother considered the solid\r\nmerits of a London mercer’s daughter, and another was very anxious to\r\nsecure as his wife the widow of a worsted merchant at Worstead, who\r\nhad been left a hundred marks in money, a hundred marks in plate and\r\nfurniture, and £10 a year in land.[182] The money side of marriage with\r\na substantial burgher must have had its attractive side also to the\r\ncounty ladies. In Nottingham, according to the “custom of the English\r\nborough,” half of the property of the husband passed at his death to\r\nhis widow;[183] and a London mercer setting up in business promises in\r\nhis contract of marriage “to find surety that if he die she to have\r\n£100 besides her part of his goods after the custom of the city.”[184]\r\n\r\nAll interests in fact conspired in effacing class distinctions to an\r\nextent unknown in European countries; and in a land where “new men”\r\nhad long been recognized among the king’s greatest officials, and\r\nwhere law created no barriers in social life, all roads to eminence\r\nlay open before the adventurer. Notwithstanding this freedom, however,\r\nthe English merchant never rose to the same height of wealth and power\r\nas the great traders of the Continent. We have no such figures as\r\nthat of Jacques Cœur,[185] burgher of Bourges, whose ships were to\r\nbe seen in England carrying martens and sables and cloth of gold; or\r\ntrading up the Rhone; or competing with rivals from Genoa, Venice, and\r\nCatalonia for the coasting trade of the Mediterranean; or sailing to\r\nthe Levant, each vessel laden with sixteen or twenty thousand ducats\r\nfor trade adventures. Three hundred agents in various towns acted\r\nas his factors in business; and his ambassadors were to be found at\r\nthe court of the Egyptian Sultan, or sitting as arbitrators in the\r\nquarrels of political parties in Genoa. “I know,” he writes with frank\r\nconsciousness of power, “that the winning of the San Grail cannot\r\nbe done without me.”[186] He had bought more than twenty estates or\r\nlordships, had two houses at Paris, two at Tours, four houses and two\r\nhotels at Lyons, houses at Beaucaire, Béziers, Narbonne, S. Pourçain,\r\nMarseilles, Montpellier, Perpignan, and Bourges. In 1450 he had spent\r\n100,000 crowns of gold on the new house he was building out of Roman\r\nremains at Bourges, and it was still unfinished. As Master of the Mint\r\nat Bourges and at Paris, and as the greatest capitalist of his nation,\r\nhe practically controlled the whole finances of France; and, indeed,\r\nheld in his hands the fortunes of French commerce, and even of the\r\nFrench nation, for it was his loans to the King that alone enabled\r\nCharles to drive the English out of Normandy. At a time when all\r\ntrade was strictly forbidden to the noble class, a grateful monarch,\r\nmindful of timely loans and of jewels redeemed from pawn by his useful\r\nmoney-lender, ennobled Jacques Cœur, with his wife and children.\r\nHis eldest son was Archbishop of Bourges; his brother was Bishop of\r\nLuçon; his nephew and chief factor was Councillor of King Réné, and\r\nChamberlain of the Duke of Calabria. But just as far as he went beyond\r\nthe English trader in his glory and success, so far he exceeded him\r\nin the greatness of his ruin. The same arbitrary power which had set\r\nhim above his fellows could as easily be used to cast him down; and\r\nafter twenty years of prosperity Jacques Cœur was a State prisoner,\r\nrobbed of all his goods, and condemned to perpetual exile. Transforming\r\nbanishment into opportunity for new ventures, he set off eastward at\r\nthe head of a crusade in 1456 to die on the journey, and find a grave\r\nin Chios.[187]\r\n\r\nBeside such a career as this, and measured by the prizes that hung\r\nbefore the adventurers of the Continent, the life of the English trader\r\nwas indeed homely and monotonous. Triumph and ruin alike were on a\r\nmodest scale. No great figure stands out from the rest as the associate\r\nof princes or the political agent of kings. No name has come down\r\nto us glorified by a vast ambition, or dignified by an intellectual\r\ninspiration, or made famous for turning the balance of a political\r\nsituation. And it is just in this fact that we discover the essential\r\ncharacter of the new commercial society in England. Instead of colossal\r\nfortunes we find a large middle class enjoying everywhere without fear\r\na solid and substantial comfort. And, perhaps as a consequence of the\r\nwidespread diffusion of material prosperity, the republic of traders\r\nhad succeeded in developing a marvellous art of organization, with all\r\nits necessary discipline. The triumphs of the English merchants were\r\nwon by a solid phalanx of men alike endowed with good average capacity,\r\npossessing extraordinary gifts of endurance and genius for combination,\r\nand moving all together with irresistible determination to their ends.\r\nThe uniformity and regularity of their ranks was never broken by the\r\nintrusion of a leader of genius pre-eminent among his fellows; and\r\nwhether in towns or in commercial fraternities, the little despotisms\r\nthat were set up were despotisms, not of a single master, but of\r\ngroups of men who had devised a common policy and by whose voluntary\r\nand united efforts it was sustained. In fact the very spirit of the\r\npeople seemed to have entered into the great industrial system which\r\nhad sprung up in their midst—a growth free and independent, nourished\r\nout of the common soil from which it came, obedient to its own laws,\r\nexpanding by the force of its own nature.\r\n\r\nNo doubt there was loss as well as gain for a society so constituted.\r\nThe special genius of the people, their remoteness from outer\r\ninfluences, the concentration of the national forces on the pressing\r\nindustrial and commercial problems of the moment; all these things\r\nevidently affected the developement of the national life, and tended\r\nin many ways to leave civilization still rude and imperfect. But in\r\naddition to this we are also conscious of the influence of a certain\r\nprevailing mediocrity of station. The horizon of the trading and\r\nindustrial classes was bounded by a practical materialism where\r\nintellect had as little play as imagination. Neither the glamour of\r\nancient Rome nor the romance of a crusade ever touched the fancy of\r\nan English merchant, busy with the problems of the hour. There is no\r\nstately dwelling of those days to show the magnificent conceptions\r\nwhich might occupy a merchant builder, and a “palace of King John”\r\nat Nottingham,[188] or a turreted house at Bristol, “the best of all\r\nthe town,” telling their tale of a comfortable domesticity, contrast\r\nstrangely with the famous building of Bourges. So far as we know no\r\ntrader or burgher possessed a library; out of the lost past not so much\r\nas a line of Horace found an echo among even the more lettered men of\r\nbusiness till over a hundred years later; not a picture was carried\r\nhome from the schools of Italy or the Netherlands; of the mighty\r\ncommerce of the world beyond the sea the trader knew everything, of its\r\nculture nothing; and England remained without any distinguished patrons\r\nof the arts or fosterers of learning save those found in bishops’\r\npalaces. And not only was the trader limited on the side of art and\r\nletters; in the hurry of business he had no time and less attention\r\nto give to political problems that lay beyond his own parish or his\r\nindustrial domain. Fortunately for his country he reaped an exact\r\nreward. His business prospered, but the work of statesmanship in its\r\nfiner sense was given to others; and in the political and commercial\r\ncrises through which England had to pass she for a time chose her\r\nleaders from men trained in another and more comprehensive school.\r\nIt was only in the next century that the merchant by degrees began\r\nto enter on a new dominion in the world of politics. Under the early\r\nTudors it became the custom to appoint as representatives of England in\r\nforeign countries traders resident in the place, and though the system\r\nis commonly put down to the niggardliness of the Court, it was more\r\nprobably due to the ruler’s sagacity. In England itself it was with\r\nThomas Cromwell, the clerk of Antwerp, the wool merchant of Middelburg,\r\nscrivener, banker, and attorney, that for the first time the man of\r\nbusiness made his vigorous entry into the Court, struck aside at a\r\nblow the venerable traditions that had gathered there round Church and\r\nState, and from the wreck and ruin of the past proclaimed the triumph\r\nof a new age.[189]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE LABOUR QUESTION\r\n\r\n\r\nPERHAPS no complaint is at first sight so startling amid the vigorous\r\ngrowth of manufacture and commerce which marked the fifteenth century,\r\nand in a society where pestilence and plague apparently kept population\r\nstationary, as the complaint of surplus labour; and the elusive way\r\nin which the problem appears and vanishes again makes it yet more\r\nbewildering. People complained at one moment of labourers unemployed,\r\nand at the next they modified old laws because they could not get\r\nworkmen enough. Masters on all sides were evading the regulations which\r\nlimited the number of their apprentices and journeymen, and still cried\r\nto the State for protection for their craft because the artizan could\r\nfind no work to do. Men talked of foreign competition and too many\r\nworkers in every trade, and took forcible measures to keep down prices\r\nand wages. The lawmakers were forbidding the import of foreign goods so\r\nas to give employment to destitute artizans at home, and the artizans\r\nwere conspiring to limit their output and raise their prices. That\r\nthere was some real trouble whose indeterminate presence can be felt\r\nbehind all these conflicting appearances we cannot doubt; but it may be\r\nquestioned whether the trouble was that of labour for which there was\r\nno demand.\r\n\r\nMany of the complaints no doubt arose in some period of peculiar\r\nsuffering, when an outbreak of war or the rivalry between England and\r\nthe Netherlands shut the great markets across the sea, and left weavers\r\nwith idle looms and bales of cloth unsold; and we must occasionally\r\ntake the phrases of statutes passed under the stress of some temporary\r\ncalamity as merely describing a distress too unaccustomed to be borne\r\nin silence. For instance the statute of 1488 which was passed during\r\nthe depression of trade that marked the first years of the reign of\r\nHenry the Seventh proposed to restore prosperity to the drapers’\r\ncraftsmen, for “they that should obtain their needy sustentation and\r\nliving by means of the same drapery, for lack of such occupation daily\r\nfall in great number to idleness and poverty;”[190] but the commercial\r\ntreaties which distinguished the next three or four years of Henry’s\r\nreign were probably more effectual than any statute of this kind, and\r\nthey sufficiently prove that the trade was not in a dying or decrepit\r\nstate.\r\n\r\nOccasionally too the murmurings of the people only tell of troubles\r\nthat follow every industrial change. To an employer the new industry\r\ncame to search out the extent of his resources and his activity. What\r\nwith the haste to make wealth, and the hurry of keeping pace with the\r\ndemands of foreign traders and of big markets, he was hard pressed\r\nby the necessity of cheap and swift production, and his attempts to\r\nimprove his industrial methods brought him into collision with workers\r\nto whom ruder and more wasteful ways of doing business were often\r\nmore immediately profitable. Labour disputes arose over questions of\r\nwages and piece-work, of holidays, of the employment of women[191]\r\nand cheap workers. Occasionally the master carried on an illicit\r\nindustry—keeping workmen privately engaged in his own house or on\r\nboard a ship in the port,[192] so as to withdraw his servants from the\r\nsupervision of the town council, and his goods from charges for the\r\ntown dues. If he had accumulated a little capital he perhaps moved out\r\nto the valleys of Yorkshire or Gloucestershire in search of water-power\r\nfor his fulling-mills, or of finer wool for his weavers; or forsook the\r\nmanufacturing town for some rural district where labour was plentiful,\r\nand where he could escape the heavy municipal dues which his business\r\ncould ill afford to pay. While the valley of the Stroud was welcoming\r\nFlemish settlers and seeing mills spring up along every stream, London\r\nand Canterbury found their manufacturing trade slipping away from\r\nthem;[193] and the glory of Norwich departed as cloth-makers pushed\r\nalong the moorland streams of Yorkshire to Wakefield and Huddersfield\r\nand Halifax, and set up fulling-mills among the few peasant huts of\r\nremote hamlets.\r\n\r\nDifficulties also arose when the manufacturer began to contrive the\r\nfirst rude form of a factory system, and so disturbed the occasional\r\nlabour of his neighbourhood; after the manner of the brewers of Kent,\r\nwho besides having to supply London and the big trading ports of the\r\ncoast were also beginning to send out beer to Flanders, and who no\r\nlonger as of old bought their malt from the people, making only some\r\ntrifling hundred quarters or so in their own houses, but began to make\r\nat home as much as a thousand or even eighteen hundred quarters, to\r\nthe hurt of those farmers and youths who had once gained a livelihood\r\nby preparing malt for sale.[194] Or perhaps enterprising masters began\r\nto introduce new machinery to keep pace with the increasing demand\r\nfor their wares. Such an innovation was resisted as hotly as in our\r\nown century. The shearers of cloth raised a cry against a new iron\r\ninstrument invented for raising the nap of cloth so that it could be\r\nquickly burned off without the old labour, while shearers were left\r\nidly loitering.[195] Among the cap-makers “some of the trade provided\r\na water-mill for fulling their caps” in 1376, by which apprentices\r\nand freemen of the trade found themselves deprived of work and “at\r\nthe point of perishing.” Their appeal to the town was of course on\r\nthe ground that caps so fulled were bad wear for the community,\r\nand the mills were in consequence forbidden;[196] but a century of\r\ndisobedience and evasions and wranglings followed until the working\r\nfullers appealed to Parliament itself, and in 1482 it was decreed that\r\nhats, bonnets, and caps, which “were wont to be faithfully ... thicked\r\nby men’s strength, that is to say with hands and feet,” should never\r\nagain be fulled in fulling-mills invented “by subtle imagination to\r\nthe destruction of the labours and sustenance of many men,” and to the\r\n“final undoing” of the cap-makers.[197]\r\n\r\nEven the question of foreign immigration stirred up contention between\r\nclothiers and weavers. Manufacturers trading in marts where the fine\r\nwork of Flemish experts—the most skilful weavers in Europe—had been\r\ndisplayed, required for the success of their trade the services of the\r\nfinely trained artizans who took refuge in England from the ruin that\r\nawaited them in Flanders, and in many a town skilled immigrants found\r\nthemselves welcome guests.[198] Under the protection of the classes to\r\nwhom the foreign artizan can never have been unwelcome—the consumer,\r\nthe merchant, and the master—he fared well enough; for so long as he\r\nwas subjected to the local control of the guild or the municipality,\r\nforced to dwell in the house of an Englishman, forbidden to sell in\r\nretail, kept under a supervision so strict as practically to shut\r\nhim out from the market, the employers of labour saw no reason for\r\nanxiety.[199] On the other hand the complacent view of the manufacturer\r\nwas not shared by the English artizan; and in places where trade was\r\nshrinking or where there was financial trouble the foreigner might\r\nchance to be made into the luckless scape-goat of the community, and\r\nhave heaped on his head all the calamities that burdened the guild\r\nor the municipality. For example, in the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury when the Bristol wool trade was half ruined by the loss of\r\nBordeaux which destroyed its great market and brought about lasting\r\nchanges in the French manufacturing centres; and by the determination\r\nof the Merchant Adventurers to establish in London and in favour of\r\nLondon merchants a practical monopoly of the cloth trade with the\r\nNorthern Seas, a complaint was made by the journeymen against the\r\nmaster-weavers who had “brought in and put in occupation of the craft\r\nstrangers, persons of divers countries, not born under the King’s\r\nobeisance but rebellious,” urged the desperate working man in search\r\nof an unassailable argument which should finally decide the matter,\r\n“which been sold to them as it were heathen people”; and the Mayor\r\ngranted the desired order that no foreign weaver should be brought into\r\nBristol[200]—a law which did not however restore the cloth trade to\r\ntheir city.\r\n\r\nIn this case we seem really to hear the complaint of the poor\r\njourneyman; and elsewhere, in appeals for compassion and protection,\r\nin statutes of Parliament and royal charters,[201] or in ordinances\r\nof Town Councils for his relief, we seem from time to time to find\r\nourselves on the brink of a labour problem present to the modern as to\r\nthe ancient world. But generally the story of foreign immigration as\r\nit has been handed down to us is in no sense the story of the labour\r\nquestion. An association of masters seeking to secure a strict monopoly\r\nfor their own advantage could not bring a more powerful argument than\r\nthe desperate situation of their workmen—an argument which might be\r\nused by a powerful corporation confident of official support, or\r\nby a dying trade which had been utterly beaten in the competitive\r\nstruggle—and which taken alone throws little light on the subject.\r\nWhen the dispute with the foreigner emerges it generally seems to\r\nbear the character of a quarrel among dealers rather than a grudge of\r\nartizans. The working man had no doubt his grievance, but it is not\r\nhis voice which we hear—it is the voice of his more noisy neighbour\r\nthe shopkeeper or the trader, who knowing that he himself had little\r\nto expect from the sympathy of the English consumer, passed briefly\r\nover the subject of his own immediate interests, and used with artistic\r\nskill the sufferings of the wage-earner to kindle a general compassion\r\nand heighten the effect of an appeal to an anxious government or\r\nan alarmed public. For as we read the Town Ordinances and Acts of\r\nParliament[202] these strange “artificers” who were setting the world\r\non fire put on the guise of pedlars or small dealers who “bring much\r\nforeign wares with them to sell,” and were thus especially obnoxious\r\nto the native traders; such foreign pests, it appears, were going “to\r\nmen’s doors” “taking up standings” and there “showing” their wares to\r\nthe undoing of the natives, and hiring servants of their own people to\r\nretail their goods about the country—an unpardonable offence in the\r\neyes of London merchants, who were moving heaven and earth to become\r\nthe only middlemen of the foreign trade. With varying success the\r\nnative dealers clamoured for protective legislation, praying that the\r\nstrangers might be forbidden to engage freely in trade, and forced as\r\njourneymen to serve only an English master, or as masters to employ\r\nonly English servants. A usurper like Richard the Third, anxious to\r\nconciliate the leading burghers of the towns, was ready among other\r\nthings to forbid any alien whatever to become a handicraftsman, or any\r\nforeigner to take an apprentice of his own people save his own son or\r\ndaughter;[203] while on the other hand, Henry the Seventh carried out\r\nhis own views of industrial policy by bringing weavers over to develope\r\nthe trade of Yorkshire and Devonshire.\r\n\r\nBut under whatever restrictions the foreigners still came, and the same\r\ncry against them went up loudly from time to time. Manufacturers and\r\nmiddlemen who would have gladly welcomed immigrants so long as they\r\ngave themselves out as men working for hire, resented the invasion\r\nof strangers coming from over sea “with their wives, children, and\r\nhousehold, and will not take upon them any laborious occupation as\r\ncarting and ploughing but use making of cloths and other handicrafts\r\nand easy occupations;” and this apparently as masters, for the\r\ncomplaint was that they employed only foreign apprentices, so that\r\nEnglish people were falling into idleness and becoming thieves,\r\nbeggars, and vagabonds.[204] “The land is so inhabited with a great\r\nmultitude of needy people, strangers of divers nations ... that your\r\nliege people, Englishmen, cannot imagine or tell whereto or to what\r\noccupation that they shall use or put their children to learn or\r\noccupy within your said cities or boroughs”—so the Londoners complain\r\nin 1514: and add that if this went on Englishmen would no longer be\r\nable to pay their rents, maintain their households, and subdue and\r\nvanquish their ancient enemies the French.[205] Hopeless, in fact, of\r\ncombating the theory of his time that trade legislation was meant in\r\nthe first instance to serve the interests of the buyer rather than the\r\ndealer, and fearing lest an argument for monopoly of sale might hardly\r\nwithstand the criticism of a hostile public, the trader was tempted to\r\ndiscover some circuitous course, and catch at the cause of the poor\r\nworkman, the terror of the French, and the patriotic vision of a nation\r\nof warrior weavers,[206] as infallible appeals to the sentiment of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWe find animosities and complaints of the same kind directed against\r\nthe struggling suburban manufacturers, who competed with the townsfolk\r\nby dint of braving every hardship, and accustoming their hands to every\r\nform of labour. To the town manufacturer they were an abomination;\r\nand he sought to enlist the sympathy of the public by loud complaints\r\nthat it was only workmen who had scarcely learned their trade who thus\r\nleft their masters to set up for themselves and make an independent\r\nliving. It is probable indeed that their numbers were often recruited\r\nby small masters who had fallen through poverty out of the regular\r\nranks of industry; as for example when an apprentice or a stranger set\r\nup in business to try his luck, and having been given perhaps three or\r\nfour years in which to pay by instalments the sum charged by the guild\r\nfor opening shop, made his escape out of the borough just before his\r\nlast fine became due,[207] being by that time possibly ready to start\r\nas a free trader in an “upland” hovel, and to eke out a scanty living\r\nby working at his hand loom or his rope-making in the intervals of\r\ncultivating field or garden. But such home industries, however they\r\noriginated, were inevitably disallowed by the municipal organizers\r\nof labour. They diverted trade, established a formidable competition\r\nof unregulated labour, reduced tolls, and emptied the tax-gatherer’s\r\ncollecting box. Town councillors and shopkeepers and journeymen with\r\none accord declared war on those who for their own “singular advantages\r\nand commodities, nothing regarding the upholding of the said towns,\r\nnor the common wealth of the handicrafts ... nor the poor people\r\nwhich had living by the same,” hired farms and became graziers and\r\nhusbandmen, and yet took to weaving, fulling, and shearing cloths in\r\ntheir own houses;[208] or who, like the grasping people that withdrew\r\nfrom Bridport, took farms “for their private lucre” and not only “used\r\nhusbandry” but made cables, ropes, ships’ tackling, and halters in\r\ntheir idle hours.[209]\r\n\r\nDisputes of the kind which have been mentioned, however, were of\r\ntrifling importance in the secular controversy between the leaders of\r\nindustry and the general body of workers, as it presented itself in\r\nthe Middle Ages; and the great problem of all—that which concerned no\r\nseparate groups or industries, but the whole mass of labour that was to\r\nbe let out for hire—was one inarticulate through its very magnitude.\r\nWhile workers were being set free from the land wherever arable farms\r\nwere turned into enclosed pastures for sheep farming, they were called\r\nfor by the manufacturer whose new business of making cloth needed more\r\nhands than the old business of selling wool. But the labour released\r\nfrom the field was perhaps not always easily transferred to the shop;\r\nand when the countryman who with his fellows had toiled on the land\r\n\r\n  “All for dread of their death such dints gave hunger,”[210]\r\n\r\nand, save when harvest time gave a brief plenty, ate in suffering his\r\ncake of oats with a few curds, his “bread of beans and peases,” his\r\nonions and half-ripe cherries, and little baked apples,[211]—when he\r\nforsook his “cote” and carried to the town nothing but his hunger,\r\nhis ignorance, his want of skill, he did not necessarily mend his\r\nfortune by turning from the serf of the landlord into the wretched\r\ndependent of the employer. Moreover, as though the obstacles in the\r\nway of his helplessness were not already sufficiently overwhelming, by\r\nthe ingenious device of man the difficulty was made yet more acute.\r\nArtificial barriers to keep in check the labour that clamoured at their\r\ngates were thrown up with all the united strength of State and Town\r\nand Guild. The State in order to protect the agricultural interest\r\nstrictly forbade the poor countryman to leave husbandry for trade,\r\nor to apprentice his child to any craft.[212] The towns for reasons\r\nof their own hastened to intensify the effect of these laws by local\r\nregulations, or by the strictness with which they carried out old\r\nenactments.[213] Finally the guilds fenced themselves about with rules\r\nto protect their monopoly by limiting their numbers and shutting out\r\nintruders. As the fifteenth century went on all these bodies alike\r\nenforced their provisions with increasing severity, and the danger that\r\nthreatened the working-class through the industrial revolution was\r\nhardened into a present calamity.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to conceive that regulations of this kind were\r\nself-denying ordinances on the part of employers to limit the supply\r\nof labour; they rather come to us as echoes of the first great\r\ncontroversy concerning the position and privileges of the hired worker.\r\nThe “protection” of industry from all competition was the first and\r\nthe last creed of the crafts (as distinguished from the general\r\npublic)—a protection by which every conceivable danger that might\r\nthreaten the interests of the monopolists was struck down, whether\r\nit was the competition of other allied trades, or that introduced by\r\nmachinery and new methods of organizing labour, or rivalry between\r\nmembers in the same craft, or the intrusion of dealers from the\r\nprovinces, or the immigration of alien manufacturers from abroad. As\r\nto the main principle there was no dispute; and there were some of its\r\nless important developements where the interests of the masters and\r\nthe journeymen coincided. But to employers and dealers the monopoly\r\nof trade chiefly meant their own monopoly of production and sale;\r\nwhile the wage-earner’s dominant anxiety was to keep surplus labour\r\nout of the craft, lest the regular workman might be deprived of his\r\ncomfortable certainty of subsistence. Labour however was too sorely\r\nneeded in the enormously increasing trade of the country for masters\r\nto deny themselves its services; nor did any of their ordinances\r\nnecessarily tend in the least to produce a result so disastrous to\r\nthemselves. In their eyes the important matter was that workers should\r\nbe kept docile and obedient, retained in country districts where they\r\nwere most advantageous to the contractor, and prevented from making\r\nclaims on the control or the profits of industry which must have\r\nhampered the great business of the moment—the expansion of English\r\ntrade; and the ability of the craft-leaders was shown in the masterly\r\ntactics which they adopted, the success which they achieved, and the\r\npolitical sagacity by which they accomplished their purpose without\r\nopen strife or public agitation.\r\n\r\nFor it seems probable that the labour question had its origin with\r\nthe very beginning of manufacturing industries, and that long before\r\nthe fifteenth century a large class of hired workers already existed.\r\nWe know that in the fourteenth century the wage-earners in the crafts\r\nalready constituted a force which the State and the municipality\r\nhad come to fear, and that not only in London but in other towns\r\njourneymen had learned discontent, and had begun to combine for\r\nself-protection.[214] We know also that before 1340 one manufacturing\r\ntown at least (and no doubt the records will ultimately tell of more)\r\nowned its miserable race of labourers who worked by the day at a bare\r\nsubsistence wage of a penny, an outcast people whose abject poverty was\r\ntheir only protection; men possessing absolutely nothing by which they\r\ncould be attached for crimes or offences, and who could laugh at any\r\nattempt of the court to summon or to fine them; while their employers,\r\nnot being held legally responsible save under some special ordinance\r\nfor such day labourers as these, took no care for the debt or crime\r\nof a class without privilege or standing in the eye of the law.[215]\r\nAnd obscure as the subject still is, we seem at a very early time\r\nto detect behind the guild system a growing class of “uncovenanted”\r\nlabour, which the policy of the employers constantly tended to foster,\r\ntheir aim being on the one hand to limit the number of privileged\r\nserving-men, and on the other to increase the supply of unprotected\r\nworkers.\r\n\r\nIt was for this reason that while the demand for manufactures was\r\nincreasing beyond all experience, the number of men who sought\r\nthrough apprenticeship to enter the trade was most strictly limited\r\nby law;[216] and when a man had finished his apprenticeship cunning\r\ndevices were found for casting him back among the rank and file of\r\nhired labourers;[217] so that the skilled workman who had passed\r\nthrough his time of service but had not been admitted to the freedom of\r\nhis trade[218]—whether because he failed to secure the recommendation\r\nof the heads of the guild, or because he was unable to pay the double\r\nfees demanded for the franchise of the city and the franchise of the\r\ncraft[219]—was condemned henceforth to remain a mere journeyman\r\nwithout apparently much hope of promotion. For the enrolled journeyman\r\nthere was some protection, though of a very limited kind, in the guild;\r\nbut a lower and more helpless class of serving-men was recruited from\r\nthe apprentices who had not worked out their full time—poor children\r\nwhose service had begun at seven or twelve, and who while yet mere\r\nlads were induced to cut short the seven or ten years fixed in their\r\ntrade for apprenticeship, and entering hastily on work for a daily\r\nwage found themselves from that time forward counted as unskilled\r\nlabourers;[220] apparently deprived of the protection of the law in\r\nthe matter of wages, without any standing in the guild, and lying in\r\nthe power of the craft-masters for their hire, they were for the rest\r\nof their lives admitted to work on sufferance as bringing cheap labour\r\ninto the market. Finally even the statutes which forbade poor country\r\npeople to apprentice their children in the towns,[221] far from proving\r\nany intention of withdrawing the villagers from the service of the\r\nmanufacturer, may have been the result of an alliance between landowner\r\nand employer to serve their several ends, and have been designed by\r\nthe town magnate merely to prevent the dependent country workers from\r\nflocking into the boroughs in search of apprenticeship and subsequent\r\nfreedom of the trade.[222] For it seems probable that the town dealers\r\nhad very early been accustomed to contract with the country folk for\r\nthe lower and rougher kinds of work. In Norwich, for example, all the\r\ntanners’ business was at first done in the country, and the skins\r\nsent into Norwich to be worked and finished by the parmenters; and it\r\nwas perhaps but a generation before the passing of the Act of Henry\r\nthe Fourth that the tanners came into Norwich and settled down by\r\nits river side. And in like manner all cloth brought to the Norwich\r\nmarket was country-made, and originally no wool was sold in the Norwich\r\nstreets and no cloth manufactured in its workshops.[223] The same\r\nsystem of contracting for work in surrounding villages[224] was known\r\nfar beyond Norwich, but its local history varied greatly with local\r\ncircumstances. In that city, where trade was manifestly too vigorous\r\nto be shut up into a few square miles, and where the surrounding\r\npopulation had turned into a people of journeymen and artizans, the\r\nmunicipality seems to have inaugurated the policy of governing an\r\nindustry it had no desire to suppress, by seizing the organization of\r\nthe country districts into the same hands as that of the town, and\r\nbringing the workers under the same municipal control[225]—a policy,\r\nit would seem, of merchants and employers mainly occupied with the\r\nexpansion of commerce, and blind to the danger which their experiment\r\nimplied of the breaking up of municipal life. But in other towns we\r\nseem to detect a vain attempt of the working population to clutch\r\nat a trade which had grown into a free maturity, and force it back\r\ninto the old municipal nursery under the tutors and governors of its\r\ninfancy; as in Worcester, where the ordinances contain many proofs of\r\nhaving been drawn up under strong popular influences, and where the\r\nmasters were forbidden to give out wool to weavers so long as there\r\nwere people enough in the city to do the work, “in the hindering of the\r\npoor commonalty of the same.”[226] It is evident that the manufacturer\r\nmight, from his own point of view, feel the strongest objection to\r\nflooding the towns with an unmanageable number of workers attached to\r\nthe guild who could, by virtue of their numbers and their covenanted\r\nposition, call on the municipal government to interfere for their\r\nspecial benefit in the management of the trade.[227]\r\n\r\nIf we consider therefore the case of the working population in\r\ntown or country—whether we remember the poor folk of the hamlets,\r\nknown to Langland, that “have no chattel but their crafts and few\r\npence taketh;”[228] or consider in the towns the lowest class of\r\ncasual labourers working at a wage of a penny a day, or the little\r\nmore fortunate groups of unskilled serving-men, or the depressed\r\ncompany of the skilled journeymen; whether we trace in villages or\r\nboroughs the astonishing multitude of religious fraternities which\r\nsometimes at least concealed an illicit attempt at self-protection\r\nby the wage-earners; or examine the rigour with which towns and\r\nguilds repressed every attempt of the working men to combine in any\r\nassociation for their common benefit—we find ourselves again and\r\nagain confronted with the problem of labour. In the thick darkness\r\nwhich still envelopes the subject dogmatism itself is swallowed up.\r\nBut as we look into the obscurity, the borderland of the covenanted\r\ntrades and the dim regions that lie beyond their recognized limits\r\nbecome crowded with the masses of the common workers—dreary groups of\r\nlabourers seething with inarticulate discontent, themselves suffering\r\nthe terrors and bondage of a harsh law, and from time to time, as they\r\nemerge into a brief light of riot and disorder,[229] kindling the\r\nalarms of the settled and protected classes above them. Associations of\r\nthe richer merchants inspired by a common interest drew together for\r\nmutual support; and friendly Town Councils whose policy was to keep\r\ndown the number of voters—especially of poor craftsmen who might be\r\ntroublesome—and all whose members were indeed themselves employers and\r\ncraft masters, made alliance with the guilds, and passed laws which,\r\nby shutting out apprentices from the freedom of the craft, debarred\r\nthem from the franchise of the town. It was in vain that from time to\r\ntime as the evil increased the central government sought to interfere\r\nwith craft-masters and wardens who “for their own singular profit” made\r\ningenious bye-laws or ordinances for the exclusion of new comers;[230]\r\nlocal alliances were too strong for it, and local wits too cunning,\r\nand one of the main results of the triumphant guild system was to\r\ndevelope throughout the country a formless and incoherent multitude\r\nof hired labourers, who could by no possibility rise to positions of\r\nindependence, and had no means of association in self-defence. As the\r\nweaker members of the crowd from time to time sank back into utter\r\npenury, the outcasts of the industrial system slowly gathered into a\r\nnew brotherhood of the destitute; and even in the fifteenth century,\r\nlong before they had been reinforced by the waifs and strays of town\r\nand country that flocked into their sad fellowship on the dissolution\r\nof the monasteries, the advanced guard of the army of paupers appears\r\nin the streets of the boroughs to trouble the counsels of municipal\r\nrulers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CRAFTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE early history of the craft guilds, like that of the municipalities,\r\nis the story of communities in the first strength of youth, growing\r\nby the force of their own vitality into forms which can be reduced to\r\nno mechanical regularity or order, and ever plastic to take on new\r\nshapes according to the shifting exigencies of an age when industry,\r\ncommerce, local government, were all in a state of revolution. In\r\nthe pride of their first creation, in the humiliation of their later\r\napparent subjection, in the victorious results at last of their long\r\ndiscipline, the guilds reflected successive movements in the great\r\nchange that transformed English society; and it would be hard to find\r\na single formula in which to express a life so free and various. Like\r\nthe boroughs their systems of government ranged from constitutions\r\nwhich, if not democratic, were at least republican, to constitutions\r\nwhich placed in command an oligarchy, whether limited or despotic; so\r\nthat we can scarcely say that the towns borrowed their methods from\r\nthe guilds, or the guilds from the towns, at a time when both alike\r\nwere perhaps tentatively feeling their way towards the only solutions\r\nof the problem of government which the time and occasion admitted. They\r\nhad the same period of intense activity, from the awakening of the new\r\nlife of England under the Norman kings, till under Henry the Seventh\r\nits industrial and commercial position was definitely established. The\r\nvery difficulties by which they were hemmed in were the true conditions\r\nof any lively growth; and it was not till the sixteenth century,\r\nwhen the militant life of the crafts came to an end, that a fatal\r\nmonotony settled down on their associations—a dreary uniformity[231]\r\nboth of constitution and of policy, which makes their period of\r\ntriumphant prosperity and imminent decay a record at once tedious and\r\ndisheartening.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the history of commerce the craft guilds necessarily\r\ntake a foremost place in their character of trading or manufacturing\r\nassociations; but we are here mainly concerned with what we may call\r\ntheir political relations to the borough, and their influence on\r\nthe growth of municipal life. The constitution of the craft becomes\r\ntherefore important, not from its economic results, but as indicating\r\nthe character and complexion of the guild, the policy which it might\r\nbe expected to pursue if it attained to authority, and the extent to\r\nwhich it could be supposed to favour popular or democratic theories\r\nof government. How far the crafts were actually able to make their\r\ninfluence felt depends on a second question as to the connexion that\r\nexisted—of what kind and closeness it may have been—between the\r\nguilds and the governing body of the borough.\r\n\r\nWe must remember that the various craft guilds represented all ranks\r\nand classes in the industrial world—the capitalist, the middleman,\r\nand the working man. There were aristocratic fraternities of the\r\nMerchant Adventurers, and of dealers living by the profits of\r\ncommerce alone, who were grouped in the great mercantile companies\r\nsuch as the vintners and spicers and grocers and mercers. In a lower\r\nscale were the middlemen and traders who produced little or nothing\r\nthemselves, but made their living mainly by selling the produce\r\nof the labour of others—such as the saddlers, the drapers, the\r\nleather-sellers, the hatters—and whose unions were in fact formidable\r\ncombinations of employers. Below these again came guilds of artizans\r\nemployed in preparing work for the dealers, to be by them sold to\r\nthe general public, as the smiths who worked for the tailors or\r\nlinen-armourers,[232] the weavers who supplied the clothiers; the\r\njoiners, painters, ironsmiths, and coppersmiths who made the saddles\r\nand harness for the saddlers; the tawyers who prepared skins for the\r\nleather-sellers; the cap-makers who fulled the caps which the hatters\r\nsold.[233] Finally there remained the crafts which both manufactured\r\nand sold their own wares, like the bakers, tailors, or shoemakers, and\r\nwho dealt directly with the consumer without the intervention of any\r\nother guild. It is evident that these various associations had all\r\ntheir own business to do,[234] and that their policy differed as widely\r\nas did the interests of the several classes. We do not find a guild of\r\nmerchants or dealers trying to raise wages or shorten hours; or a guild\r\nof artizans seeking to depress labour and assert the supremacy of the\r\nmiddleman; or a mixed guild of masters and men intent upon lowering\r\nprices for the public. But we may still ask whether behind all obvious\r\ndivergences of interest and of power, there was any ruling instinct\r\ncommon to all these brotherhoods of trade.\r\n\r\nThe original motives which drew men together into craft guilds were\r\nno doubt everywhere the same—the desire to obtain the monopoly of\r\ntheir trade and complete control over it;[235] and also to find the\r\nsecurity which in those days organized associations alone could give\r\nto the poor and helpless against tyrannical and corrupt administration\r\nof the law, just as in the country men enrolled themselves under the\r\nlivery of a lord or knight who was their adequate protector against the\r\niniquities of the courts[236] and by whose arbitration their quarrels\r\nwere adjusted.[237] For these purposes associations were formed of\r\nthe entire trades of various districts. All the members of the craft,\r\ngreat and small, were enrolled in the fraternity; and thus every\r\nguild, to whatever order in the hierarchy of industry it belonged,\r\ncontained within itself the various ranks of workers who belonged to\r\nthat particular occupation. It is in this organization of the whole\r\ncraft into a compact body arrayed in self-defence against the world\r\noutside, and in the means that were used to maintain it, that we trace\r\nthe peculiar characteristics of the mediæval guild as opposed to those\r\nof modern associations. From the very outset its society was based on\r\ncompulsion. Dealer or artizan had no choice as to whether he would join\r\nthe association of his trade or no, that question being settled by the\r\ncharter which gave the craft power to compel every workman to enter\r\ninto its circle. A constitution such as this left a profound mark on\r\nthe conduct and ultimate policy of every guild, for where there was no\r\nreal freedom of association there proved at last to be no real freedom\r\nof government. Societies such as the modern trade union, created and\r\nmaintained by the good will of men naturally bound to one another by\r\ncommon occupation and interests, and who expect from their association\r\na common benefit, may long persist as voluntary institutions with a\r\ndemocratic government. But the ancient guild—a fraternity of the\r\nwhole trade with all its ranks and classes, employers and wage-earners\r\nalike, compulsorily bound together into one fellowship as against\r\nthe world without, and whose common interest in association tended to\r\nbecome more and more visionary—was inevitably driven to preserve by\r\nforce an artificial and ill-compacted union; and instead of a free\r\nself-governing community, there grew up a society ruled by its leading\r\nmembers in a more or less despotic fashion, according to the character\r\nof the trade itself and to the support given to its governors by the\r\nauthorities at Westminster or in the municipality.[238]\r\n\r\n(1) For it is plain that no intimate union can ever have existed\r\nbetween the three orders that practically made up the guild.[239]\r\nAt the head of the society stood the master and the aldermen or\r\nwardens, drawn from among the wealthiest men of the trade; and grouped\r\nimmediately round them were all those who, after having passed through\r\nthese offices, retained for life a position of dignity among the\r\nmembers, and from whom the court of assistants or governing council was\r\nwholly or partly formed.\r\n\r\n(2) Then came the commonalty, the craft-holders or shopkeepers\r\nor “masters” of the trade—a term which by no means necessarily\r\nimplies _employers_ of labour, but rather artificers admitted into\r\nthe “mestier”[240] or mistery—who were alone responsible before the\r\nlaw for offences[241] committed in their shops or work-rooms, and\r\nwere therefore alone authorized by the guild to take work from a\r\ncustomer.[242]\r\n\r\n(3) Last came the hired workers—that is the trained journeymen or\r\nserving-men; for the unskilled labourers working for a daily hire and\r\napprentices can scarcely be reckoned as in any sense members of the\r\nguild.\r\n\r\nIn a society thus constituted the notion of self-government never for\r\na moment implied the modern notion of democracy, or even the idea\r\nthat authority should be exercised only by the will of the majority.\r\nIn some fraternities indeed the whole community of craft-masters took\r\npart directly in the yearly election of officers, though probably\r\nthis was the extreme bound and limit of their influence;[243] but in\r\ngeneral there was the same tendency in the guilds as in the boroughs\r\nto choose their governors by some indirect and complicated system\r\nthrough which the commonalty was kept well in restraint. Either the\r\nalderman himself nominated candidates for the various offices, from\r\namong whom the select council or fellowship made their choice, or\r\nhe appointed a few picked men, five or seven or eight as the case\r\nmight be, to choose the rulers for the next year.[244] In the same\r\nway the two or four “sufficient and discreet men” who were to assist\r\nthe alderman, “the helpmen and overseers,” or the council of eight\r\nor twelve or twenty-four, were chosen either by a similar committee,\r\nor by the direct choice of the alderman himself “with the aid of his\r\nfraternity.”[245] Nor is there any evidence that this method of\r\ngovernment by the select few was a growth of later corruption; it is\r\nmore probable that in societies which could only be founded at the\r\nwish of the more prosperous men in the trade, since they alone could\r\nundertake to raise the money for its charter or guarantee the payment\r\nof its yearly rent, these men were accustomed, in return for their\r\nmoney or as a security for it, to hold the management of the community\r\nin their own hands; and this seems confirmed by traces of the system\r\nwhich we find in very early times, as well as by what we know of the\r\norigins of later fraternities.\r\n\r\nIf the power of the masters was thus limited, the mere journeymen were\r\npractically of no account at all in such great matters as election\r\nand legislation. Perhaps in some trades they occasionally exercized\r\na slight influence, as in the case of the London bowyers, whose\r\nordinances were agreed to “as well by serving-men as by masters.”[246]\r\nBut in general it is doubtful whether the voice of the hired worker\r\nwas ever heard or his will consulted, however much his obedience to\r\nthe ordinances was required and enforced. It was supposed that his\r\ninterests were sufficiently protected by the town authorities, to\r\nwhom an alien who was cheated by his master, a journeyman who found\r\nhis wages paid on the truck system, or a weaver who saw his labour\r\nsupplanted by that of a woman or a foreigner, could make his complaint;\r\nand who were bound to see that no freeman of the borough took more\r\napprentices into his household than he could promise to support\r\ncomfortably; that the apprentice was not chastised beyond measure,\r\nnor turned out penniless at the end of his service;[247] and that no\r\nfraudulent action of his master should rob him of the benefit of the\r\nexact tale of the years of service he had fulfilled.[248]\r\n\r\nIn all that concerned the hired worker, indeed, law had become so\r\nrigid and so detailed by the time that Parliament, the Town Council,\r\nand the Craft wardens, had taken their turn at legislation, that it\r\nmight be plausibly assumed that nothing remained for the discussion\r\nof the working man. By a series of statutes Parliament endeavoured to\r\nkeep the hire of the workers and the length of the working day fixed\r\nin spite of the increase of trade;[249] and mayors and bailiffs in\r\nall boroughs[250] were ordered to compel labour to keep its allotted\r\ntimes, and to proclaim the wages of craftsmen twice a year, “and that\r\na pair of stocks be in every town to justify the same servants and\r\nlabourers.”[251] Whatever was left undefined by Parliament was put\r\nunder rule by the subordinate authorities. Town Councils made provision\r\nfor the punishment of “rebel and contrarious” men in the mayor’s court,\r\nexamined and corrected the customs of the crafts, forbade workmen to\r\nmake their bargains anywhere save openly at the market cross, and fined\r\nthem if they stood there beyond one day in the week,[252] probably\r\non the supposition that they were holding out for a higher wage or\r\nshorter hours. The guild-masters regulated the prices to be paid for\r\npiece-work,[253] issued orders allowing work to be done by night,\r\nand made rules as to apprenticeship and service.[254] For greater\r\nsecurity moreover the masters were accustomed to enter into covenants\r\nfor mutual protection against their servants—“And if any serving-man\r\nshall conduct himself in any other manner than properly towards his\r\nmaster, and act rebelliously towards him,” said the Whittawyers, “no\r\none of the trade shall set him to work until he shall have made amends\r\nbefore the mayor and aldermen.”[255] On the other hand journeymen were\r\ninvariably bound by oath not to make any sort of confederation among\r\nthemselves,[256]—a precaution which State and town and guild were\r\nequally vigilant in enforcing. Under such a system as this, if at any\r\ntime the workers proposed to disturb the statute wage or the statute\r\nday, they had to contend not only against the upper class of their\r\nown craft, the masters and wardens and shopkeepers, but against the\r\ngoverning body of the town, and the opposition of the whole community.\r\n\r\nNeither oaths nor laws nor public opinion however could permanently\r\nprevent men from combining to better their position, and from time\r\nto time we can follow the fortunes of a struggle which, when the\r\ntown records are published, will probably be shown to have been very\r\ngeneral. In London alone we have during a single century records of\r\nstrikes among the workmen of four trades—the shearmen, the saddlers,\r\nthe shoemakers, and the tailors.\r\n\r\nThe journeymen of the cloth shearers took a lesson in combination\r\nfrom the employers. “If there was any dispute between a master in the\r\nsaid trade and his man,” ran the complaint of the masters about 1350,\r\n“such man has been wont to go to all the men within the city of the\r\nsame trade, and then by covin and conspiracy between them made, they\r\nwould order that no one among them should work or serve his own master,\r\nuntil the said master and his servant or man had come to an agreement;\r\nby reason whereof the masters in the said trade have been in great\r\ntrouble and the people left unserved.” These men were also making a\r\ncovert attempt to raise their payment by refusing to work at day wages,\r\nand insisting on piece-work through which they could gain more money;\r\nwhile the masters, so long as they were forced by law to sell at a\r\nfixed price, had a valid reason for protesting before the mayor that\r\nthere must be some relation between lowering the price of their wares\r\nand raising the wages of their workmen, or they themselves would be\r\nset between the upper and nether mill-stone; and for making a petition\r\nthat the men might be chastised and commanded to work according to the\r\nancient usage “as matter of charity and for the profit of the people.”\r\nThe city magistrates granted ordinances which forbade any attempt to\r\nsettle trade disputes by strikes, and ordered all complaints to be\r\nbrought before the warden of the craft (himself of course a master),\r\nand failing him before the mayor. Though the court did not forbid\r\npiece-work, it fixed its price at the low rate that prevailed before\r\nthe Plague.[257] On the whole the victory therefore lay with the\r\nmasters.\r\n\r\nThe shoemakers’ servants were early in the field. They made their\r\nfirst rebellion before 1306, the main results of which seem to have\r\nbeen a decree added to their old ordinances that the journeymen of the\r\ntrade should make no provisions to the prejudice of the public;[258]\r\nand perhaps the imposition of an oath that they would not make\r\namong themselves any union or confederation.[259] For eighty years\r\nthey waited before making a new attempt. At last in 1387 a “great\r\ncongregation” of them met at the Black Friars “and there did conspire\r\nand confederate to hold together ... and because that Richard Bonet\r\nof the trade aforesaid would not agree with them made assault upon\r\nhim so that he hardly escaped with his life ... to the alarm of\r\nthe neighbours.” The meeting was illegal, not only because of their\r\noath, but because of a law passed four years before to forbid any\r\nconfederation among workers; so to make their position more regular the\r\npoor shoemakers hit upon the plan of calling in the help of a friendly\r\nfriar preacher, “Brother William Bartone by name, who had made an\r\nagreement with their companions that he would make suit in the Court of\r\nRome for confirmation of that fraternity by the Pope; so that on pain\r\nof excommunication and of still more grievous sentence (!) afterwards\r\nto be fulminated, no man should dare to interfere with the well-being\r\nof the fraternity. For doing the which he had received a certain sum of\r\nmoney which had been collected among their said companions.” This form\r\nof Papal interference, however, was not to the mind of Londoners—“a\r\ndeed,” they said, “which notoriously redounds to the weakening of the\r\nliberties of the said city and of the powers of the officers of the\r\nsame.” The mayor accordingly threw the leaders into prison,[260] and\r\nthe attempt of the luckless journeymen came to an end.\r\n\r\nThe serving-men of the saddlers tried another plan, and formed in 1383\r\na religious fraternity whose ostensible duties were perfectly harmless.\r\nIts members were wont once a year to array themselves in a like suit\r\nand go out beyond the city bounds to Stratford (in other words, out\r\nof reach for the moment of the city authorities) where they held a\r\nmeeting, and returned to hear mass in honour of the Virgin in the\r\nchurch next to the Saddlers’ Hall; also from time to time their beadle\r\nwould summon journeymen to attend at vigils of the dead and pray for\r\nthe souls of their old comrades. According to the masters, however,\r\nthis was but “a certain feigned colour of sanctity” under which the\r\nmen merely wasted their masters’ time and conspired to “raise wages\r\ngreatly in excess”—in fact in the space of thirteen years, from 1373\r\nto 1396, they had increased their hire to twice or three times the old\r\ncustomary rate. The mayor and aldermen agreed with the masters as to\r\nthe dangerous character of these proceedings, forbade any such meetings\r\nor any fraternities for the future, and ordered that the serving-men\r\nshould be under the masters, and that the “masters must properly treat\r\nand govern” them as in all other trades.[261]\r\n\r\nThe journeymen tailors took a bolder line, for they not only held\r\nillegal meetings both within and without the city bounds, at which\r\nthey assembled wearing a common livery, but also hired houses in the\r\ncity where they lived in companies, and defied both their own masters\r\nand the officers of the city. Whereupon the masters and wardens of the\r\ntrade notified to the mayor and aldermen “that they were exceedingly\r\nsorrowful at there being such offenders and such misdeeds”; and the\r\nmayor and aldermen “after holding careful council and conference\r\nthereon” decided that it was manifestly to the public peril to allow\r\njourneymen and serving-men—a race at once youthful and unstable—to\r\nhave a common livery at their assemblies, or common dwelling-houses\r\nby themselves. The settlement was broken up, and livery and meetings\r\nforbidden. Then the tailors also put on the colour of sanctity, and\r\na couple of years later (in 1417) we find them petitioning to be\r\nallowed to meet for prayers and offerings for the souls of deceased\r\ntailors.[262]\r\n\r\nThat similar attempts, with the same impotent conclusions, took place\r\nin other manufacturing towns is certain; though we have not yet the\r\nmeans of measuring the extent of the movement. The uniform failure\r\nof every effort at revolt, even the acquiescence of the workmen when\r\nrevolt was impossible, declare the helplessness of the mediæval\r\nlabourer, entangled as he was in a vast net-work of commercial\r\ntheories, administrative maxims, and arguments of vested interests\r\npublic and private. For in a society where law ruled all industry, the\r\nwhole community was on the alert to resist any defiance of ordinances\r\navowedly made for their own protection.[263] The right to strike was\r\ndenied by law and vehemently resisted by public opinion as contrary to\r\nthe common good; and disputes were settled, not as now by an agreement\r\nvoluntarily made within the trade, but by the formal decision of the\r\nmunicipality, against which there was no appeal.\r\n\r\nAt the same time it is evident that in their dealings with journeymen\r\nand hired servants, if in no other respect, the municipalities did no\r\nmore than carry out exactly the intentions of the guilds themselves.\r\nFrom the moment that they come into view the crafts—that is, all the\r\nmore important ones, for from the nature of the case we know very\r\nlittle about the poorer sort of associations or the humbler trades\r\nconcealed under the form of religious societies—are distinguished by\r\nthe same creed and policy. Their essential character was laid down\r\nin the oligarchic schemes of administration to which they inclined;\r\nand, as we have seen, the purity of the guild government was further\r\nmaintained by the pains which was taken to prevent the journeymen\r\nfrom pressing on into the upper ranks and weakening the established\r\nsystem by multiplying the number of small masters; and to select with\r\nadequate care the people admitted to be subjects with constitutional\r\nrights—a people chosen as far as possible from an upper class and\r\neven from the hereditary stock of the guild.[264] By an original\r\nstringent constitution therefore, and by their own later discipline,\r\nthe governing oligarchy was protected as by a double course of\r\nentrenchments; and a third line of defence was formed by keeping guard\r\nover every entrance through which the common workman might make his\r\nway into the superior class of artizans who, in however inferior a\r\ndegree, might still be recognized as more or less officially attached\r\nto the craft. In its very nature, therefore, the guild organization was\r\nadverse to the claims of the men who worked for hire, and under its\r\ngovernment the journeyman was practically condemned without a hearing.\r\nWhat with the influence exercised by the masters in the Town Council\r\nand government, and what with the credulous fears of the public of\r\nconsumers when they were told what “contrarious” workmen might do in\r\nraising prices and limiting supply, and “the many losses which might\r\nhappen in future times” through combinations of hired labour, the\r\nvictory of the employers was never for a moment doubtful,[265] and\r\nunions of journeymen such as those which sprang up in the fourteenth\r\nand first half of the fifteenth centuries, broken and disabled almost\r\nat the outset, seem, so far as we can see, to have been again and again\r\ncrushed out of existence by the overwhelming forces of guild and town\r\nand state brought to bear on them, and to have found no permanent life\r\ntill the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubt a sense in which the strong rule of a governing\r\noligarchy fully justified itself throughout the course of the struggle\r\nfor autonomy between the rising crafts and the rising municipalities.\r\nShaking itself free from discussions and divisions within its own body\r\nby asserting the triumph of the stronger party, the guild was able to\r\nmaintain in practice the consistent theory of its constitution—the\r\nundisputed supremacy of the masters in the regulation of the trade\r\npolicy; and through centuries of varying and doubtful fortunes the\r\ncrafts still contrived to present to the world outside an unbroken\r\nfront and a certain air of independence; holding together in companies\r\nunder leaders of their own choosing, and, save in rare instances,\r\nscorning to stoop to the custom common in France or Germany of having\r\ntheir chief officer appointed by some external authority.[266] But this\r\nbold militant attitude was only maintained through a rigid discipline,\r\nand by a ruthless suppression of every attempt to break the ranks.\r\nA body to all appearance uniform, but in fact split up into two or\r\nthree hostile groups, the craft only preserved its air of harmony by\r\nabandoning all pretence at democratic government, and avowedly subduing\r\nthe weaker classes to the stronger. The policy which had been its\r\nsafety in the time of conflict remained its settled creed in the time\r\nof power. It is clear, therefore, that if ever the members of the guild\r\nforced their way into the council chamber of the town, their appearance\r\ncan scarcely be taken as marking a popular or democratic movement. That\r\nit enlarged the governing class by bringing in a new group of men to\r\ntake part in the active political life of the country is evident; but\r\non the other hand these men do not seem to have contributed a single\r\nidea to political experience, or carried political experiment a single\r\nstep further. Saturated with the customary views of administration\r\nwhich were the fashion in the upper class of town society, and by which\r\ntheir own interests had been so well served, the craft-masters sent\r\ntheir representatives to the council only to give new strength to the\r\ncoercive policy of the governing oligarchy. The character of the trade\r\nfraternity was fully shown when, victorious over the foes of its own\r\nhousehold, strong in its complete organization, the craft guild rose\r\nout of its long subjection to public control, and seizing into its own\r\nhands municipal authority, destroyed its terrors for the trader. When\r\nthis last step was taken the crafts stood forth in full realization of\r\ntheir ideal—close corporations fully equipped against the whole body\r\nof consumers, and masters of the labour of the country. What has been\r\ncalled the decline of the guild system may more truly be called its\r\ntriumph—the revelation of its constant aim and true significance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A\r\n\r\nSTATUTE WAGES IN 1388.\r\n\r\n                                   _s._ _d._\r\n  Bailiff for husbandry             13    4 a year with clothing.\r\n  Master-hind, carter, shepherd     10    0\r\n  Ox-herd and cow-herd               6    8\r\n  Cowdriver                          7    0\r\n  Swine-herd and woman labourer      6    0\r\n\r\nNo servant of artificer or victualler in a town was to take more than\r\nthose in the country (12 Richard II. cap. 4.).\r\n\r\nIN 1444.\r\n\r\n                         _s._ _d._             _s._ _d._\r\n  Bailiff of husbandry    23    4  With clothing 5    0 and food\r\n  Hind, carter, shepherd  20    0         ”      4    0    ”\r\n  Labourer                15    0         ”      3    4    ”\r\n  Woman servant           10    0         ”      4    0    ”\r\n  Child under 14           6    0         ”      3    0    ”\r\n\r\nSummer wages of mason or carpenter 4_d._ a day with food, without\r\n5_d._; tiler, slater, rough mason, and builders 3_d._ with food; other\r\nlabourers 2_d._ Without food 1_d._ more in all cases.

Rogers (Work and Wages, ii. 327) fixes the\r\nwages of the ordinary artizan in the fifteenth century at 6_d._ a day\r\nand agricultural wages at 4_d._, carpenters a little under 6_d._,\r\nplumbers 6-1/2_d._, masons 6_d._ The board of a skilled artizan might\r\ncost in 1438 about 2_s._, of a common labourer about 1_s._, very\r\ncommonly from 8_d._ to 10_d._, most generally 8_d._ (Agriculture and\r\nPrices, iv. 505, 751-2.) In 1395 a Nottingham “layer” was charged for\r\nworking two days as stone-cutter for 12_d._ against the law, and the\r\njury stated that “all the carpenters, all the plasterers, all the\r\nstone-cutters, all the labourers, take too much for their craft by\r\nthe day, against the statute of our lord the King.” (Nott. Rec. i.\r\n275.) For a list of wages paid in 1464 see ibid. ii. 370-373; in 1511\r\niii. 328-337. In 1495 a man was employed to dig stones at 3_d._ a day\r\nwithout food.\r\n\r\nThat there was difficulty in enforcing the legal wage and that there\r\nwas often a difference between the prices actually paid and those which\r\nthe law books spoke of as still valid is evident from the ingenious\r\nmethods in use of evading the law. Sometimes the workman was paid his\r\nboard wages and given his food besides; or false entries were made in\r\nthe account books; or a yearly fee was given in addition to wages;\r\nor he was paid a sum of so much a mile for coming to and going from\r\nhis work; or his wages were calculated at 6_d._ or 5_d._ according to\r\nability for 365 days in the year, against the statute which forbade\r\nthe workman to receive hire for holidays or for the eves of feasts.\r\n(Rogers’ Agric. and Prices, i. 255; Work and Wages, ii. 328-330; Stat.\r\n4 Henry IV. cap. 14.)\r\n\r\nThe legal hours of work for country labourers from March to September\r\nwere from 5 A.M. till between 7 and 8 P.M., with half an hour for\r\nbreakfast, an hour and a half for dinner; from September to March, from\r\nthe springing of the day till the night of the same day. They were not\r\nto sleep in day-time save after dinner from May to August. (Stat. 11\r\nHenry VII. cap. 22.) The Saturday half-holiday from noon seems to have\r\nbeen universal. In shops trading on Sundays, holidays and vigils was\r\nvery generally forbidden in the middle of the fifteenth century, save\r\nin harvest time, and unless “great high need may excuse.” (Kingdon’s\r\nGrocers’ Company, ii. 190; Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 169.) Rogers (Work\r\nand Wages, i. 180-2) calculates that an artizan working three hundred\r\ndays a year could earn from £3 15_s._ 0_d._ to £4 7_s._ 6_d._, and in\r\nLondon might get from £6 5_s._ 0_d._ to £6 17_s._ 6 _d._ a year. Walter\r\nof Henley (ed. by Miss Lamond, p. 9) gives forty-four weeks, leaving\r\neight weeks “for holidays and other hindrances.” But in his translation\r\nof Walter’s Husbandry, Bishop Grosseteste adds a phrase (ibid. 45)\r\nwhich throws a new light on the matter. “In these forty-four weeks be\r\n264 days besides Sundays”—an explanation which certainly expands the\r\namount of leisure allowed to country labourers, whether it applied to\r\ntown artizans or no.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE CRAFTS AND THE TOWN\r\n\r\n\r\nFROM the mediæval Craft Association to the modern Trade Union the\r\ndistance, as we have seen, is great. In the guild or “mistery” of\r\nthe older world, instead of associations of working men we have to\r\ndeal mainly with associations of producers or middlemen, whose battle\r\nis not the organized attack of wage-earners on the profits of their\r\nmasters, but an attempt of dealers and manufacturers to stand out for\r\ntheir interests against the whole body of consumers or against the\r\naggressions of competing trades; while far from being a voluntary\r\nassociation, or a self-governed institution of spontaneous growth,\r\nits individual members were if necessary enrolled by compulsion, and\r\ngoverned with little regard to their own consent. But the relations\r\nbetween the trades and the municipalities show a yet more striking\r\ncontrast. According to a modern English theory the common good is\r\nbest served when we allow every artizan and trader perfect liberty to\r\ndevelope his own industry in his own way.[267] But the mediæval world\r\nwas fully convinced that since all trade and manufacture was carried\r\non for the benefit of the public, all trade and manufacture should be\r\nsubject to public control; and no one then questioned that it was the\r\nduty and the right of the State or the municipality to fix hours of\r\nlabour, rates of wages, prices of goods, times and places of sale, the\r\nquality of the wares to be sold, and so on. In the interest, not of\r\nthe trader or manufacturer, but of the whole community, the central\r\ngovernment made general laws for regulating industry, and the towns\r\ncarried out these laws by their officers and filled up the blanks\r\nof legislation after their own will; while in the exercise of the\r\nenormous power which law and public opinion gave to the authorities,\r\nthe power of the people was supposed to be used with impartial justice\r\nalike against the dealer or the employer and the artizan or serving\r\nman, whenever individual claims clashed with what seemed to be the\r\npublic advantage. Hence to the governing body of the borough the trade\r\nassociation was a mere matter of public convenience; and was so little\r\nregarded as depending on the free will of the craft itself that it was\r\nfrequently founded by order of the town, and was invariably compelled\r\nto make submission to superior force and receive orders from its master\r\nthe municipality. Unable to secure the passing of any new rule save\r\nby convincing the authorities on some pretext or other that it was\r\ndevised in the interest of the whole commonwealth, the craft came\r\nat last to be considered as a society which existed mainly for the\r\nadvantage of “the common people of the realm,” and indeed, bowing to\r\na hard necessity, itself contracted the habit of solemnly disavowing\r\nany special regard for “its own singular profit,” and apologetically\r\ndescribed itself as the humble servant of the municipality and the\r\nobedient minister of the public, in phrazes which the modern trade\r\nunion would scarcely accept as an adequate description of its uses.\r\n\r\nThis service of the public, however, was in no sense a voluntary\r\ntribute of the guilds, nor did it enter in the slightest degree into\r\ntheir original scheme; and if through long and severe compulsion\r\nthe crafts learned to wear with decorum their odd cloke of apparent\r\ndevotion to the common weal, behind this ostensible policy and\r\nfeigned colour of self-abnegation they had still their own purposes\r\nto serve, which were by no means the purposes of the rest of the\r\ncommunity. Occasions of discord were probably far more frequent\r\nthan provocations to unity and concord in the society of a mediæval\r\ntown, with its hierarchy of struggling workers—the rising dealers,\r\nthe small masters who employed two or three servants, the artizans\r\nwho let down the ledge from their window to display the goods which\r\nthey had themselves made, journeymen working for a statute wage, and\r\nunskilled labourers for whatever they could get—men for the most part\r\nliving meagrely by incessant toil, and to whom the public, thrifty\r\nand inclined to bargains, was “the enemy”; and with its population\r\nof consumers, poor and ignorant, without the means of travelling,\r\nforced to buy what they wanted on the spot and thus deprived of such\r\nprotection as may be given by a larger competition, able to afford\r\nlittle beyond the mere necessaries of life so that every fraud brought\r\nto them real suffering, and to whom the trader represented the ancient\r\nadversary lying in wait among the gins which he had privily set for\r\nthe innocent. The thin veil of civility thrown over the situation by\r\nthe polite phrazes of contemporary convention which have come down to\r\nus in ordinance and compact deceived nobody concerned; and between\r\nthe “poor commons” and the whole army of crafts reconciliation never\r\nwent farther than an armed truce. To the consumer the dealers seemed\r\nall alike steeped in iniquity. Shopkeepers measured out their wares\r\n“by horn or by aim of hand,” or in chance cups and dishes; and sold\r\nin dark corners where a man could not see what scamped work and\r\ndeceitful goods were being handed over to him. Clothiers gave out bad\r\nyarn in scanty measure, and stretched out the list of their cloth\r\nwith cunning presses “in deceit of the poor commons.” Hatters because\r\nthey knew that everyone must needs wear hats charged exorbitantly for\r\ntheir wares, and shoemakers were no better, so that statute after\r\nstatute vainly sought to mend them. Chandlers asked scandalous prices\r\nfor wax candles, images, and figures, “by which means divers of the\r\npeople be defrauded of their good intent and devotion.”[268] “All the\r\nbakers, butchers, fishers, taverners, poulterers, chandlers, tanners,\r\nshoemakers, cooks, hostelers, weavers, and fullers,” according to the\r\ncomprehensive statement of the Nottingham Mickletorn jury in 1395,\r\nwere asking too high prices and selling bad goods; and they go on the\r\nnext year to repeat the same complaints.[269] Above all the anger of\r\nthe common folk burned hot against the traders they knew best, the\r\npowerful licensed victuallers who heaped up to themselves riches with\r\nthe food that should have fed the starving workers: “for took they on\r\ntruly, they timbered not so high.” The “sundry sorrows in cities,”\r\nfevers and murrains and floods, or fires which burned down half the\r\ntown and seemed ever to begin by the falling of a candle at a brewer’s\r\nor some “cursed place,” were the vivid testimony of the anathema of\r\nthe poor and the righteous vengeance of heaven falling on the sinful\r\ntraders;[270] and the common rumour of the market is still heard behind\r\nthe poet’s parable of the day when Guile was at the point of death, and\r\nwhen it was only the shopkeepers who recovered him to life:\r\n\r\n  “But merchants met with him and made him abide,\r\n  And shutten him in their shops to showen their ware,\r\n  And parrelled him like their prentice the people to serve.”[271]\r\n\r\nAs for the crafts, on the other hand, whether they were combinations\r\nof employers, or associations of middlemen or dealers, or unions of\r\nwage-earners, or societies of masters and men, in one respect their\r\nunanimity was unbroken; for inspired by a reasonable hostility to the\r\nconsumer who wanted to cheapen their wares, they were all ranged on the\r\nsame side in the common controversy as to who was ultimately to fix\r\nprices, the seller or the buyer. Then obvious policy was declared in a\r\nnumber of conspiracies which were constantly made in the various trades\r\nto raise prices by combination among the dealers; but unfortunately\r\nfor the traders, always on the watch as they were for opportunities,\r\nthey still found the public as alert as themselves, and more powerful\r\nto accomplish their will. When Edward the Third in 1331 fixed the\r\nprice of wine of Gascony at 4_d._ a gallon the retail dealers, who\r\nhad apparently found their profit best secured by the absence of any\r\nstatutory prices for their goods, broke into open rebellion, and “all\r\nthe taverners of the city making a confederacy and alliance among them”\r\nclosed the doors of their taverns and would not allow their wines to be\r\nsold; till to “put a check upon this malignancy” the mayor and sheriffs\r\nproceeded through the city, and had the names of the taverners so\r\nclosing their taverns written down, twenty-nine in number, and twelve\r\nmen from each ward of the city were summoned by the authorities to\r\ndecide in the name of the injured wine-drinkers upon the punishment\r\nto be awarded to the taverners for their contumacy.[272] In 1363 and\r\nagain in 1411 the consumer was protected by law against the rich\r\nPepperers who had formed a company in 1345, and were accused of raising\r\nprices.[273] The whole body of chandlers in Norwich were presented at\r\nthe Court Leet in 1300 for a certain agreement made among themselves\r\nthat “no one of them shall sell a pound of candles for less than\r\nanother.”[274] And in 1329 when a lime-burner of London bound all the\r\nmembers of his trade by oath not to sell lime below a fixed price, and\r\n“by reason of his great conspiracy” almost doubled the price of lime,\r\nthe city rulers imprisoned him and the “conspiracy” was cut short.[275]\r\n\r\nAlliances of this kind to increase profits or raise prices were\r\nuniversally met by a determined resistance on the part of the\r\npublic.[276] But the “poor commons” went far beyond a policy of mere\r\nself-defence. They aimed in fact at nothing less than putting the\r\ncrafts altogether under the yoke of the community, at seizing the\r\nwhole organization of trade which had been built up and binding it\r\nover to perpetual service. Nothing could have been more distasteful to\r\nthe guilds. In the twelfth century, while municipal government was in\r\nits very infancy, they had already aimed at complete independence and\r\na real autonomy; and certain crafts did in fact succeed in making a\r\nspecial bargain with the King over the heads of the local magistrates.\r\nBy charters bought at Westminster fraternities were made dependent for\r\ntheir existence on the royal will alone; and were granted rights of\r\nsupervision and jurisdiction over their workmen without any reference\r\nto the borough;[277] and since in these early charters the only\r\ndefinite provision was that all the men of the trade in that particular\r\ndistrict should be enrolled in the guild, the freedom of the craft\r\nas a whole remained for the moment unquestioned even if the freedom\r\nof the individual was limited. An independence so complete however\r\nwas bitterly resented by town governments. In London for example the\r\nweavers lived in a quarter by themselves into which the city officers\r\nnever entered. They had their own courts and special privileges, and\r\nraised their taxes through their own officers. Under the protection\r\nof the King’s writ they successfully defied the town authorities,\r\nand when in the time of Henry the Third the citizens seemed likely\r\nto overpower them by force they laid up their charter of rights in\r\nthe Exchequer as a perpetual record of their privileges. The jealousy\r\nexcited in municipal bodies by an alien society settled in their midst,\r\nwhere the town writs did not run, is not surprising. Every interest\r\nof the city was threatened—the monopoly of the sale of cloth claimed\r\nby the burgesses, the authority of the town magistrates, the orderly\r\nsystem of administration which the kings were building up, and the\r\ninterests of the whole body of consumers. A natural apprehension of\r\nany danger to the unity of the borough was shown not only in London,\r\nbut in Winchester, Oxford, Marlborough, Beverley,[278] and possibly\r\nin other towns; the weavers were shut out of the franchise and all\r\nits privileges, hampered in their trade by all sorts of oppressive\r\nregulations, forbidden to buy their tools, or possess any wealth,\r\nor sell their goods save to freemen of the city, while the status\r\nof villeins and aliens in the city courts was allotted to them. But\r\nmere repression left the real evil untouched; and by 1300 the city\r\nauthorities in London had found a more radical cure. The Mayor had\r\ngained the right to preside in the weavers’ court if he chose, and to\r\nnominate the wardens of the guild;[279] and no sooner was all danger\r\nfrom an independent rule thus averted than the weavers were granted\r\npower to buy and sell “like other free citizens.”[280]\r\n\r\nFrom this time all independent trade jurisdictions in the towns came to\r\nan end.[281] No more charters such as that of the weavers were sold by\r\nthe crown;[282] and the crafts were presently forced to conciliate the\r\nlocal powers according to their measure of art or cunning—to beg from\r\nthe municipal government a formal recognition for their association\r\nwith such limited liberties as the town officers could be induced to\r\ngive; to secure a more or less precarious existence by the payment\r\nof fines to the town treasury;[283] or to wrap round them a solemn\r\nconventional disguise, and conceal wholly or in part the fact of their\r\nunion for trade purposes by sheltering themselves under the form of a\r\nreligious association, and seeking independence “under a feigned colour\r\nof sanctity”[284] as men wholly moved by a zealous care for the souls\r\nof their dead comrades but taking no thought for the bodily welfare of\r\nliving brethren.\r\n\r\nBut by whatever means the fraternities hoped to compass liberty, it\r\nwas in vain that they sought to elude the heavy hand of the municipal\r\ngovernment. Trade associations were laid hold of by the boroughs,\r\nbrought under the discipline and authority of the public magistrates,\r\nand forced to take their due part in the developement of the municipal\r\norganisation.[285] Towns which obtained a grant to have “all reasonable\r\nguilds” took care to maintain a reasonable authority, and craft\r\nfraternities were only given leave to exist on the express plea that\r\nthey were “consonant with reason and redounding to the public honour\r\nand to the advantage of the common weal”;[286] while privileges were\r\nmeted out to them on the distinct understanding of the gain which was\r\nto spring from these to the whole commonalty. By a dexterous move\r\non the part of the town governors the officers of the guild were\r\ntransformed into the officers of the community, and the machinery of\r\nthe guild became the means by which the public sought to provide for a\r\nfull and cheap supply of the necessaries of life, and protected itself\r\nfrom overcharges and false measures and bad wares, from uproar and\r\ndisorder, from drunken workmen, from the flying sparks of the smith’s\r\nforge, or the noise of his hammer at night. In London for example there\r\nwas a constant succession of customers complaining at the Mayor’s\r\nCourt of the bad bargains they had made in buying cloth, so that the\r\nfullers found themselves excessively “hard worked” in appearing at the\r\nGuildhall to examine the cloths of discontented buyers, and begged that\r\nevery one might buy at his own risk.[287]\r\n\r\nThe masterly manœuvre executed by the town magistrates is revealed\r\nin the self-denying ordinances passed by the later guilds. Crafts\r\n“petition,” as we are gravely told, to have masters and ordinances, and\r\nthese being granted the new rules turn out to be simply regulations to\r\nsupply wares to the people of a fixed quality and price.[288] We can\r\nscarcely believe that the farriers should of their own free will have\r\ndevised the rule that if any one of them, through negligence or any\r\nexcess of pride which hindered his asking advice of the craft, failed\r\nin curing a horse of sickness, “then he shall be accused thereof\r\nbefore the Mayor and Aldermen and be punished at their discretion, in\r\nthe way of making restitution for such horse to the person to whom\r\nthe same belongs.”[289] Nor is it likely that masons and carpenters\r\nshould have volunteered to take oath before Mayor and Aldermen that\r\nthey would do their duty in their trade;[290] or that the masons should\r\nthemselves propose that if a mason failed to fulfil his contract\r\ncertain men of the trade who acted as his securities should be bound\r\nto finish his task.[291] Even the universal rule against night work\r\nwas never among the London guilds (save in the single instance of the\r\nhat-makers)[292] made in the interest of the working-man; but on the\r\ncontrary was dictated by the sagacious observation of the buyers that\r\n“sight is not so profitable by night, or so certain, as by day—_to\r\nthe profit, that is, of the community_;”[293] and if spurriers “who\r\ncompass how to practise deception in their work desire to work by night\r\nrather than by day”[294] the reason given for interfering with them was\r\nthat they wandered about all day idle, and “then when they have become\r\ndrunk and frantic they take to their work to the annoyance of the sick\r\nand all their neighbourhood ... and then they blow up their fires so\r\nvigorously that their forges begin all at once to blaze ... and all\r\nthe neighbours are much in dread of the sparks which so vigorously\r\nissue forth in all directions from the mouths of the chimneys in their\r\nforges.”[295] Sunday closing itself was ordered as a matter of public\r\nconvenience, because apprentices “could not be trusted to carry on work\r\nin the absence of their masters at church.”[296]\r\n\r\nIn thus bringing the crafts into subjection the towns were greatly\r\nstrengthened by the sympathy of the State, which was the more inclined\r\nto make common cause with them from a growing apprehension of guilds\r\nof artificers and other labourers which in troubled times might prove\r\ncentres of disturbance throughout the country. By a series of statutes\r\nthe ancient powers of crafts were carefully pruned, and new authority\r\ngrafted on to the town governments. “Congregations and confederacies”\r\nwere jealously watched and forbidden.[297] The guilds were ordered\r\nto have their charters registered, and their rules and bye-laws\r\napproved by the chief magistrates of the town. They were forbidden to\r\nmake ordinances to the damage of the King or the people. Sometimes\r\njurisdiction over their own members was taken from them; and the right\r\nof search for any articles that “be not pure lawful and able chaffers,”\r\nor even the duty of seeing that the workers were duly paid their wages\r\nin ready money, was handed over to the town officers.[298]\r\n\r\nThus it came about that by the triple alliance of the officials at\r\nWestminster with the governing class of the town and the general\r\nbody of consumers, all alike bent on organizing industry in their\r\nseveral interests, the primitive free associations of workers were\r\ngradually forced into the singular position of deferential servants\r\nof the community. Within its own little realm each guild might use a\r\nnarrow independence or a petty tyranny, but in its public aspect it\r\ncould assert few pretensions.[299] No craft fraternity could be formed\r\nwithout the leave of the municipality, and every Warden took his oath\r\nof office before the Mayor, at whose bidding and subject to whose\r\napproval he had been elected.[300] The rules made by any trade for its\r\ngovernment had no force till they had been approved by the Mayor and\r\nCorporation, enrolled by them on the city records, and sealed with\r\nthe common seal.[301] And since they reserved the right of making any\r\naddition to these ordinances which they might deem necessary,[302] the\r\ntown magistrates could interfere whenever they chose in the interests\r\nof order. Not only did they bear rule over the seller in the market,\r\nbut they followed the craftsman to his little workroom and ordered\r\nevery smallest detail of his trade, material, wages, apprentices, cost,\r\nthe fit of a coat and the quality of a shoe, according to the laws that\r\n“reserved all time to the Mayor and to the Council of the town power\r\nto correct, to punish, amerce, and redress, as well the masters and\r\nall other persons of the said crafts, each after their deserving and\r\ntrespass, as the case asketh.”[303] Men who offended against the rules\r\nof the trade were brought before the town officers for punishment, and\r\nhalf their fines went into the town treasury.[304] Even the wandering\r\nartizans who moved from place to place, who had no fixed shops and no\r\ncomplete guild organization, found themselves subjected to the town\r\nauthorities as soon as they had crossed the borders of the borough.\r\nCarpenters, masons, plasterers, daubers, tilers, and paviours had to\r\ntake whatever wages the law decreed and to accept the supervision of\r\nthe municipal rulers,[305] and their regulations were framed according\r\nto the convenience of the borough. Thus after the big storm of 1362\r\nin London they were forbidden to raise their prices for repairing\r\nthe citizens’ roofs;[306] and the same ordinances of Worcester which\r\ndirect that chimneys of timber and thatched houses should be done away\r\nwith, and stone or brick chimneys and tiled roofs everywhere made by\r\nmidsummer day, contain regulations for the tilers who must have flocked\r\nto the city on such an occasion. They must set up no parliament to make\r\nany one of them “as a master and all other tilers to be as his servant\r\nand at his commandment, but that every tiler be free to come and go to\r\nwork with every man and citizen freely as they may accord.” No stranger\r\ntiler coming to the city was to be forced to work for any city tiler,\r\nbut might take whatever work he liked by the day.[307]\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the whole movement was conceived and carried\r\nout is one of the most surprising things about it; and nothing was\r\nwanting to the thoroughness with which mediæval society carried out\r\nits theory of the use which the craft guilds might be made to serve,\r\nwhether willingly or no, in protecting the interests of the public.\r\nOne discovery followed on another. As the King for convenience of\r\nadministration constantly delegated new powers to the Mayor, and\r\nsuccessive Acts and Charters added to his load of responsibilities\r\nfor supervising work and wages and wares, so the Mayor in his turn\r\npassed on these charges to the craft—apparently exalting its power,\r\nin reality undermining its independence. Town governors embarrassed\r\nby the difficulty of overawing a turbulent community and keeping the\r\npeace with the aid of a couple of constables, found in the guild\r\norganization an admirable machinery all ready to their hands, and\r\nturned its officers, responsible as they were for the good behaviour\r\nand order of the whole trade, into an effective city police; so that\r\nwhen Bristol was in danger of a general riot in consequence of the\r\nimprisonment of its Mayor, the sheriff and recorder simply summoned the\r\nmasters of the various crafts, and ordered them to keep the peace in\r\ntheir several trades. In the same way the crafts might be charged with\r\nthe duty of “setting the watch” at night.[308] Difficulties of taxation\r\nwere lightened by shifting responsibility from the municipal officers\r\nto the guilds—by charging for example the bakers or blanket-makers or\r\nfullers with a certain proportion of the ferm, to be collected among\r\ntheir members and paid in by their officers.[309] If walls were to be\r\nrepaired and gates and towers and piers maintained, or if the expenses\r\nof a public festival were to be met,[310] the craft might again be\r\nbrought into use, and for the due performance of the allotted task\r\ntheir common funds or individual profits might be reckoned as security.\r\n\r\nWhen the town had thus laid firm hold on the guilds and discovered\r\nthe various uses to which these bodies might be put in the municipal\r\nscheme, it began to look on them with as much favour as it had formerly\r\nshown distrust,[311] and proceeded industriously to multiply their\r\nnumbers both by creating new fraternities and reorganizing the old\r\nones.[312] The public opinion of the day showed itself strongly\r\nin favour of guilds, and indeed often outran the desires of the\r\nworkin-gmen, so that the drawing together of artizans into the later\r\ncraft fraternities was not always a matter of free will. If trades did\r\nnot associate at their own wish they were presently forced to do so,\r\nand at the end of the fifteenth century we find the towns everywhere\r\nissuing orders that crafts which had hitherto escaped should be\r\ncompelled to group themselves into companies. In Sandwich, for example,\r\nbarbers, surgeons, and wax-chandlers were incorporated in 1482; and in\r\n1494 wardens were appointed of the companies of tailors, shoemakers,\r\nweavers, and shearmen.[313] In Canterbury, where a spirit of revolt\r\nagainst the rules of the corporation seems to have gone abroad, where\r\nstrangers were setting up trades within the liberties and laws had to\r\nbe made to insure their paying “reasonable fine” for so doing, where\r\nmasters neglected to enroll their apprentices in the books of the\r\nCommon Chamber, and where the servants in husbandry riotously resisted\r\nthe Statute of Labourers, the outraged city authorities declared that\r\nthe crafts needed new regulations “to maintain due order for the\r\nweal and increase of the same,” and set to work to tighten the hold\r\nof the government on manufacturer and artizan, by forcing the trades\r\nto form themselves into companies, and setting at the head of every\r\ncraft or mystery two of the city aldermen.[314] In very many cases the\r\nlater incorporation of trades was connected with a pledge to undertake\r\ncertain town works such as the building or repairing of gates;[315]\r\nand here we probably find the clue to the growing custom of combining\r\nseveral poor societies into one substantial association. When the\r\ncrafts of Canterbury began to grudge spending their money on the Corpus\r\nChristi Play and on the Pageant of St. Thomas (which had to be revived\r\nin 1504 and paid for by the corporation), and also neglected “setting\r\nthe watch,” the Town Council would have none of the excuse of poverty,\r\nonly made “for lack of good ordering of certain crafts within the\r\nsame city not corporate”; and it was settled that every trade “being\r\nnot corporate for the nonsufficience of their craft be associate,\r\nincorporate, and adjoining to some other craft most needing support, if\r\nthey will not labour to be corporate within themselves”; any obstinate\r\ncraft that did not make suit to the Burghmote by next Michaelmas to be\r\nincorporate was to pay 20_s._ and give up their bodies for punishment.\r\nThe shoemakers were accordingly joined in one guild with the\r\nleather-sellers and pouchmakers, the apothecaries with the grocers and\r\nchandlers.[316]\r\n\r\nBut if the town carried on business in this high-handed and imperious\r\nfashion, still in the double bargain made between the municipalities\r\nand the crafts it is not to be supposed that the advantage was all\r\non one side. If the guild had services to sell to the community,\r\nit in its turn demanded a fair price. The trading society received\r\nall the benefits which fall upon communities by law established;\r\nand municipalities fostered with tender care the fraternities whose\r\ndiscipline they had first seized into their hands.[317] If trade\r\nwas reaching out its branches to markets beyond the sea or if it\r\nwas withering away, if the serving-men were growing poor or if they\r\nwere waxing prosperous and threatening to dictate wages and prices,\r\nif new machinery was introduced to replace human labour, if foreign\r\ncraftsmen came in to supplant the home-bred artizan—whatever the\r\ntrouble might be the government of the people bravely stepped in to\r\nset the matter right. Craft rules once entered on the city records\r\nbecame an admitted part of the city statutes, to be enforced by the\r\nauthority of the whole community, and the master found his jurisdiction\r\nrecognized and enforced, and might call on the mayor, “if the men are\r\nrebels or contrarious and will not work,” to deal with them “according\r\nto law and reason.”[318] The whole strength of the town government\r\ncould be invoked to suppress “foreign” labour or alien dealers and\r\nmanufacturers, or combinations of men against their employers. No\r\nremedy was too heroic for patriotic burghers if they thought the\r\nprosperity of the local manufacturers was in danger. When the cloth\r\ntrade of Canterbury had fallen into an evil plight the Town Council\r\npassed a law ordaining that in the next year the mayor and each of the\r\ntwelve aldermen should buy a certain amount of cloth, the forty-eight\r\ncouncillors one-half that amount, and certain well-to-do inhabitants a\r\nlike measure according to their degree.[319]\r\n\r\nThe system in fact was a curious balance of compromise among three\r\ndistinct parties to a triangular strife—the whole body of traders\r\nand manufacturers organized in craft guilds, whose primary object was\r\nnaturally to secure “their own singular profit,” as the phrase went,\r\nand to take on themselves as few of the common burdens as possible—the\r\nbody of householders organized for civic purposes as the mayor,\r\ncouncil, and commonalty, whose business was to keep order and carry\r\non government—and the entire population of the town considered as\r\nconsumers, who were thinking only of the supply of their own wants and\r\nwhose chief aim was to buy the trader’s goods at the lowest possible\r\nprice. For a time the borough corporations and the big public had\r\nthe triumph on their side, and the traders were held in a position\r\nwhich was judged to be “consonant to reason.” But if the crafts passed\r\nthrough a period of subjection while their organization and discipline\r\nwere being perfected, this by no means implied the practice of a like\r\nhumility when they had learned how to manipulate the narrow oligarchy\r\nthat formed the corporation, and to despise the incoherent masses\r\nthat made up the body of consumers. For all this time the guilds\r\nwere steadily, by the help of the town customs and administration,\r\nfortifying themselves in their position, strengthening their monopoly,\r\nclosing their ranks, shutting out competitors from their gains. There\r\ncame at last a moment when the crafts matched their strength with that\r\nof their masters, and the municipalities surrendered to the forces\r\nwhich they themselves had drilled. How completely the mediæval theory\r\nof the consumer’s interest in legislation about industry was swept\r\naway by the final success of the crafts in enforcing by their compact\r\nmajority the original purpose of their own members, we may see from\r\nthe chasm that separates in principle the ancient trade guild from the\r\nmodern trade union. To-day we also are constantly making attempts to\r\nregulate industry through combinations whether of capitalists or of\r\nwage-earners. We have our associations of employers which have grown\r\nup to resist their workmen, and our unions of working-men formed to\r\nfight the employers; but neither is in the least concerned with the\r\ninterests of the public, and not even in a phrase of courtesy are any\r\nof our modern associations supposed to “redound to the common profit”\r\nof the buyers. In this profound difference between the old and the\r\nnew organizations of industry we may find a measure of the tremendous\r\nimportance of the victory achieved by the crafts, when they had\r\nlearned to use the disciplined forces of the guild for the capture of\r\nthe municipal government. In later times, when public opinion almost\r\nceased to work through the machinery of local government and only found\r\noccasional or incoherent expression, teaching societies under their\r\nmore modern name of companies employed the same compact organization\r\nof monopolists to press their claims with redoubled success on the\r\nattention of the all-powerful central authorities, and the protection\r\nof the consumer was more and more forgotten in the protection of the\r\nprivileged trader.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n Besides the instances which have been given of the interference of the\r\n town with the crafts in questions that concerned the public, or that\r\n concerned the journeymen, there were other interesting cases in which\r\n it took part in struggles between the guilds of artizan producers\r\n and the guilds of dealers or middlemen for whom they worked. For the\r\n difference between the greater and the lesser crafts must always be\r\n borne in mind, and the fact that some of them were mere associations\r\n of working-men whose ordinances prove their subordinate position;\r\n though except possibly in rare instances the association was not\r\n originally formed, or at any time mainly used, for the purpose of\r\n resisting the middlemen.\r\n\r\n The weavers in London for example who lived by themselves in a\r\n special quarter of the city formed a union of independent artizans,\r\n each of whom possessed his own loom; if by chance he became rich\r\n enough to own a second, he set his son or his wife to work at it,\r\n being forbidden by the craft-guild to hire it out of his own house\r\n and so increase the number of workers. They worked for the guild of\r\n “burellers” or cloth-makers, who gave out the yarn which they wove\r\n into a coarse cloth, and paid them a fixed wage or price by the\r\n piece. In very early times the weavers complained of the bad quality\r\n and short quantity of yarn supplied to them by the burellers, and\r\n of the prices paid for weaving; and about 1290 they planned a whole\r\n scheme of organized resistance. They reduced the hours of labour by\r\n stopping night-work, and appointing seasons when no work at all might\r\n be done; they limited the number of workers by excluding new comers\r\n and forbidding looms to be let out on hire; and as their work was\r\n necessarily done by the piece, they ruled that a given length of cloth\r\n which could easily be made in two or three days should always count as\r\n four days’ work and no less; and apparently further devised means for\r\n making plausible overcharges for work done. To compel the obedience of\r\n members of the guild they ordered that any weaver who offended against\r\n these regulations should be called up for judgement before their\r\n governing council of twenty-four, and punished by it in formal fashion\r\n in the same way as for offences against legal ordinances. And to force\r\n the submission of the burellers, they commanded a general strike among\r\n the weavers in case of complaint, and that all work should be stopped\r\n until amends were made for the wrong done. In the face of a public\r\n which had already fixed prices and wages by law and considered that\r\n question finally closed, the weavers who found themselves shut out\r\n from direct methods of gaining their ends had thus taken the crooked\r\n way, at least so their enemies said, of raising prices by limiting\r\n production, and thus forcing up the price of cloth.\r\n\r\n For ten years middlemen and workmen seem to have fought out their\r\n quarrel together; but in 1300 the burellers brought their grievances\r\n to the mayor’s court, and charged the weavers with making new\r\n ordinances contrary to all law. There was little sympathy in the city\r\n courts for craftsmen whose rules were framed “for their singular\r\n profit and to the common injury of the people,” and the jury decided\r\n that the weavers had no right to limit the production of cheap cloth\r\n for the public by any device whatever. They were forbidden to shorten\r\n hours of labour by stopping work at any time save at night, or to\r\n check manufacture by preventing weavers from hiring out their looms\r\n to men of the craft; piece-work might be done as fast as any weaver\r\n chose to do it; all overcharges for work were forbidden. And lastly\r\n strikes were absolutely prohibited. In a second trial in 1321, when\r\n the obstinate weavers were called up before the king’s judges at the\r\n Tower, charged with making a “conspiracy and confederation” in the\r\n Church of St. Margaret de Patyns to raise the price of weaving each\r\n cloth by 6_d._, the king’s serjeant, who prosecuted, explained with\r\n precision that an unlimited number of workers working at full speed\r\n meant low wages and an abundance of cheap cloth, and that any attempt\r\n to reduce the number of labourers, to bring in short hours, or slow\r\n work—every device in fact by which the output of cloth was limited,\r\n was a device to empty the burgher’s purse into the workman’s pocket.\r\n In the common interest such “malicious machinations” must needs be put\r\n down; and indeed it would seem that some doubts were entertained about\r\n the wisdom of interfering even with night-work if the public was to\r\n have cheap cloth. (Riley’s Liber Custumarum, 123, 416-425.)\r\n\r\n The guild, which by this time had declined from three hundred and\r\n eighty to eighty looms, was probably never strong enough in London to\r\n renew the strife. Perhaps the Flemish weavers supplanted them and took\r\n up the battle, for we find that in 1362 and 1366 they in their turn\r\n were making congregations and collecting money among the people of\r\n the trade through their bailiffs. By the ordinances which were drawn\r\n up to meet this emergency it was settled that in future congregations\r\n of the workers and collections of money among them might only be made\r\n with the consent of the twenty-four best men of the trade, and that\r\n these twenty-four should be chosen at the discretion of the mayor and\r\n aldermen. (Mem. Lond. 306-7, 332.)\r\n\r\n A yet more complicated controversy divided the various crafts\r\n concerned in the making of saddles, where we have the reverse case of\r\n a union of middlemen conspiring to put under their feet the crafts\r\n of artizans with which they were connected. The London Saddlers who\r\n sold to the public formed as early as the twelfth century a guild of\r\n employers and middlemen. (Madox, 26.) Of the different crafts that\r\n worked for them were the Joiners who made the wooden framework, the\r\n fore and hind saddle-bows cut out of a quarter of a horizontal section\r\n of a tree and hollowed to fit the horse’s back; the Painters who\r\n painted these frames; and the Lorimers (that is the coppersmiths and\r\n ironsmiths) who made the metal work for the trapping and the harness\r\n of the horses. As for the saddlers themselves they seem only to have\r\n put the finishing touches to the saddles, or put on the leather\r\n covering for the great lords who were not contented with painted wood;\r\n but as all orders and all sales were carried out by them they had the\r\n ultimate control of the whole trade.\r\n\r\n The first dispute arose out of the complaints of the public of the\r\n badness of saddles supplied to them; the saddlers threw the blame on\r\n the joiners; and the joiners seem to have in their turn pushed it\r\n back on an illegal or “blackleg” labour encouraged by the saddlers\r\n for their own advantage. “Bad apprentices who fly from their masters,\r\n and other false men, betake themselves to the woods, and there make\r\n up their work of saddle-bows glued together and send them by night to\r\n painters and to saddlers within the franchise” who profited largely\r\n by the cheap labour of the “bad apprentices” working under the cover\r\n of the woods. The authorities forbade these practices, and in 1308\r\n granted to the joiners’ guild ordinances to protect their monopoly of\r\n the trade and check irregular labour. (Lib. Cus. 80.)\r\n\r\n A few years later the joiners made common cause with the painters\r\n and lorimers—a formidable conspiracy, for the lorimers had already\r\n been organized as a craft for half a century, and ordinances which\r\n strictly protected their monopoly lay for safe keeping in the city\r\n treasury. (Lib. Cus. 78-9. The lorimers included two ranks—the master\r\n who kept house and forge and paid fine to the commune of London; and\r\n the journeymen who paid to the mistery but not to the city.) In 1320,\r\n however, the saddlers contrived to have the lorimers’ ordinances\r\n annulled and publicly burnt in Cheapside. (Lib. Cus. lix.) In 1327\r\n the combined trades broke out into open war one day in Cheapside and\r\n Cripplegate, and “strongly provided with an armed force exchanged\r\n blows and manfully began to fight.” (Riley’s Mem. 156-162.) Mayor and\r\n sheriffs came to stop the riot; the trades were summoned to appear at\r\n the Guildhall, and complaints were presented on both sides. The story\r\n of the saddlers was (1) that the three trades had organized a union\r\n for strike purposes, in case any one of them should have a quarrel\r\n with any saddler.\r\n\r\n (2) That the coppersmiths were “out of their own heads” refusing to\r\n receive any strange workman of the same trade into their craft until\r\n he shall have made oath to conceal their misdeeds, the implication\r\n being of course an attempt to raise prices by limiting numbers.\r\n\r\n (3) And further the joiners and painters “do set every point of\r\n their trade at a fixed price ... by reason whereof they are making\r\n themselves kings of the land, to the destruction of all the people of\r\n the land and to the annihilation of the saddlers.”\r\n\r\n The trades emphatically denied both the strike conspiracy and the\r\n fixing of prices, which at all events indicates that they knew such\r\n claims would never be conceded by the public, and formulated their\r\n counter-charges.\r\n\r\n (1) That the saddlers had formed a “conspiracy and collusion among\r\n themselves” and bound themselves to it by oath that they would compel\r\n the joiners, painters, and lorimers not to sell to any one but\r\n themselves any work they did pertaining to saddlery. The workman was\r\n thus to be bound to them hand and foot.\r\n\r\n (2) That when the workmen come to ask for payment due to them they\r\n are so bandied about among the said saddlers with offensive words,\r\n beaten, and otherwise maltreated, that they have no longer the daring\r\n to demand their just debts.\r\n\r\n (3) That the saddlers make old saddles into new, thus cheating the\r\n workmen of trade that ought to come to them.\r\n\r\n The first charge was denied by the saddlers, but as they promised\r\n henceforth never to make any confederacy again their denial was\r\n scarcely conclusive. They pleaded that the sheriff’s court was the\r\n place for questions of debt. And they promised never again to sell old\r\n saddles for new.\r\n\r\n Evidently the excitement in London over this trade dispute was\r\n extreme, for when arbitration by the city officers was proposed, and\r\n the crafts summoned to meet in the church of St. Martin’s le Grand\r\n before six chosen aldermen, they arrived there in so great multitudes\r\n and with such a concourse of people eager to hear the solution of the\r\n great trade problem, that no business could be done. The aldermen\r\n ordered another meeting at which elected representatives from each\r\n craft only should attend. Six saddlers therefore were confronted with\r\n two ironsmiths, two coppersmiths, two painters, and two joiners;\r\n and after a day’s discussion a new group of thirteen was chosen by\r\n the trades and a concord was made “by the ordinance of these common\r\n friends and presented to the mayor and aldermen.” The result was a\r\n decided victory of the working crafts over the dealers. The nine\r\n chief offenders among the saddlers were driven out of the trade, and\r\n the saddlers bound in a heavy penalty never again to take them back,\r\n to sustain them, or to help them, till they had made peace with the\r\n crafts. (Mem. Lond. 156-162.) As to the introduction of “blackleg”\r\n labour by the masters, it was decreed that no stranger was to be\r\n brought into the trades till he had been received at the husting by\r\n the assent of eight respectable men of the craft. The regulation that\r\n no repaired work was to be sold for new prevented another form of\r\n irregular labour, since trades might not legally repair for any but\r\n private customers.\r\n\r\n In this instance it was the employers’ union that was beaten; but\r\n it is evident that the question mainly turned on the convenience of\r\n the public, and their dislike to have bad saddles supplied to them.\r\n It is also evident that save in the case of some unusually powerful\r\n combination of working crafts there was but little hope for the\r\n humbler trades in a conflict with dealers or employers backed by the\r\n public in keeping down prices. The Tawyers or dressers of skins made\r\n ordinances in 1365 “as to how they shall serve the pelterers and how\r\n much they shall take for their labour.” (Riley’s Mem. Lond. 330.)\r\n The records may state that the ordinances were “provided and made\r\n by the serving-men called tawyers,” but it is hard to believe that\r\n these “serving-men” acted of their own free will in framing rules\r\n which put their necks mercilessly and irrevocably under the yoke of\r\n the pelterers, binding themselves to serve them only, to work for the\r\n old fixed prices, and to bow to their jurisdiction in trade offences\r\n “according to the award and discretion of the rulers of the trade of\r\n pelterers.”\r\n\r\n There were other grounds of dispute between craft and craft, and\r\n battles raged at times between guilds as to the boundaries of the\r\n trades, and the relations between them—disputes which sprang from\r\n the “overlapping” of different crafts engaged upon one and the same\r\n product; or from the “apportionment” of work between closely related\r\n trades. Shoemakers were forbidden to be tanners (Stat. 13 Rich. II.\r\n i. cap. 12); then allowed to tan leather till the next Parliament\r\n (Stat. 4 Henry IV. cap. 35); and in 1423 again forbidden to be tanners\r\n (2 Henry VI. cap. 7). And as the tanners were protected against the\r\n shoemakers, so shoemakers were protected against cobblers. There\r\n was many a quarrel between the cordwainers who made new boots and\r\n the cobblers who mended old ones, the cobblers complaining that the\r\n cordwainers were preventing them from gaining their living as they had\r\n done of old. In 1395 at the king’s order the mayor summoned twelve of\r\n each craft to state their grievances. The question of how much mending\r\n might be supposed to make a new boot required the most detailed\r\n inquiry: and the apportionment of labour was exact. No person who\r\n meddled with old shoes was to make new ones; all work with new leather\r\n was declared to be within the sphere of the cordwainers, and the\r\n cobblers were restricted to mending, and that with very small pieces\r\n of leather. Fourteen years later the lines were drawn still more\r\n precisely; the re-soling of old boots was reserved to the cordwainers,\r\n but the cobblers were allowed to mend with pieces of new leather boots\r\n that were burnt or broken. (Mem. Lond. 539-40, 572-3.) Ordinances of\r\n this kind were not necessarily designed for the protection of the\r\n workers, though no doubt that may often have been partly intended; but\r\n in the first instance were probably meant to make the supervision of\r\n trades and inspection of wares more efficient in the public interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE TAILORS OF EXETER\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was in the fifteenth century, at the very time when the towns\r\nseem to have been most energetic in tightening the bonds that held\r\nthe crafts fast to their service, that we find the crafts on their\r\nside most impatient of subjection, and eager to test their strength\r\nin a direct conflict with the civic rulers. Their restless energy\r\nbroke down all barriers between trade and politics, and forced each\r\ninto the service of the other; for by whatever stratagem the crafts\r\nproposed to compel the constituted authorities to recognize them in a\r\npartnership of power—whether a wealthy guild planned the winning of\r\na charter which should make it a free and independent corporation in\r\nthe town; or whether a combination of less powerful trades demanded\r\nto be officially included in the municipal government which regulated\r\ntheir business, or in any other way to control its action—in any and\r\nevery conflict with the ruling oligarchy the guilds were forced to\r\nenlist the sympathy of the burghers and to become leaders of popular\r\ndiscontent. On the other hand the commons, with no resource against\r\nthe official class save an occasional mass meeting, eagerly welcomed\r\nthe aid of the disciplined army enrolled in the guild, and under the\r\npolitic guidance of expert leaders, to give weight to their claims for\r\nmore power. Thus under the stress of the growing passion for political\r\nemancipation, trading interests constantly seem to merge altogether\r\ninto the ambitions and animosities of parties wholly occupied in a\r\nconflict about civic rights. No doubt a prevailing suspicion of some\r\nsuch intimate connection between the desire of the crafts to escape\r\nfrom municipal control and a democratic movement in city politics, gave\r\nfire to the discussions which from the first origin of the question\r\ndisturbed market-place and council-chamber, law-court and Parliament,\r\nand proclaimed the vehemence of feeling with which so great a matter\r\nwas debated.\r\n\r\nIn the Tailors’ Fraternity of Exeter we have a very curious example of\r\nthe part which the Guild organization played in municipal politics.\r\nWe have already seen the optimistic view taken by the Mayor and\r\nhis Fellowship of “the great commonalty of the city,” united and\r\nharmonious, and worthily represented by the patriotic officers into\r\nwhose hands an absolute and unquestioned power had been committed; so\r\nthat when John Shillingford sends to the Recorder and the Fellowship an\r\naccount of his doings in London in the matter of the Dean and Chapter,\r\nhe simply begs them first to make such corrections as they saw fit,\r\nand adds, “This done I pray you to call before you at the Hall the\r\nsubstance of the commonalty praying every one of them in my name and\r\ncharging them in the most straightest wise in the King’s behalf to\r\ncome before you in haste for the tidings that I have sent home to you;\r\nand that ye wisely declare before them these answers; so that they\r\nsay manly yea and nay _in such points as you think to be done_.”[320]\r\nThroughout the whole of the Mayor’s letters there is not the slightest\r\nindication that he had ever heard of any “impetuous clamours” of a\r\nrevolutionary Exeter mob, little mindful of the honour of the city; nor\r\nthat after a hundred years or more of gathering discontent a crisis was\r\nclose at hand when the commonalty was to measure its strength against\r\nthe corporation. Nevertheless the union of the moment was but the union\r\nthat comes of confronting a common enemy; and the townsmen seemed\r\nto be only waiting till that strife was temporarily hushed to fling\r\nthemselves again into the discussion of their own domestic differences.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that from the time when the people of Exeter began to\r\nelect their own mayor, bailiff, and eight aldermen of the wards, they\r\nwere also accustomed to appoint a body of twelve men to aid the mayor\r\nin all difficult business.[321] As at Colchester, Norwich, and many\r\nother towns, the elections were made by a double jury of Twenty-four;\r\nbut how the Twenty-four were themselves elected we do not know. In the\r\nfourteenth century they seem already established, like the Twenty-four\r\nof Norwich, as a permanent council to advise and assist the Mayor; but\r\nthe Twelve apparently survived alongside of them, for freemen were\r\nforbidden to assemble for the election of a mayor “in the absence of\r\nthe Thirty-six”; and the Twenty-four were unable to perform any act\r\nsave in the presence of Twelve men.[322] Until the records of Exeter\r\nare published, however, it is impossible to define the relations of the\r\ntwo bodies; and the manner in which the Twenty-four took possession of\r\nthe Council Chamber is unknown.[323]\r\n\r\nIn Exeter, as elsewhere, trouble broke out in the middle of the\r\nfourteenth century between the two factions of the community—between\r\nthe commons, discontented and rebellious; and the governing class,\r\nwho appear, not as innovators or usurpers, but as the conservative\r\nguardians of “the ancient orders and customs of the city.” The quarrel\r\nbegan in 1339 with “impetuous clamours” of the people against the\r\nconstant re-election of one or two men as mayors; and for one year\r\nat least they carried their point, perhaps by some breach of former\r\ncustoms of election, for a decree was immediately issued that the\r\npeople were not to gather together on the day of the mayor’s election\r\n“in the absence of the Thirty-six”; perhaps by some help from the\r\nChurch and from country patrons, for it was further ordered that no\r\nclerk of the Consistory Court, nor any man who did not live in the\r\ncity should be elected mayor or allowed in any way to meddle with the\r\nelection. The decree that no burgher might be excluded from the office\r\nwho was resident, had been seneschal and had the hundred shillings of\r\nproperty which was generally required in all boroughs was, if we may\r\njudge from other boroughs, simply a recapitulation of the common custom.\r\n\r\nThat the quarrel was still agitating the people’s minds some years\r\nlater is shown by the ordinances of 1346 and 1347. The first forbade\r\nthat a mayor should be immediately re-elected—an order evidently made\r\nto quiet public opinion but which the Twenty-four had no intention\r\nof observing. The second ordinance of 1347 decreed that the election\r\nshould be made “by Twenty-four persons who upon their several and\r\nrespective oaths shall make the election”—in fact it declared anew the\r\ncustom which had been already recognized for fifty years, and probably\r\nfrom the first institution of the office, though of late years it had\r\nbeen called in question.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the governing body was apparently complete,[324] and\r\nit was indeed inevitable that so long as the city had to keep up its\r\nstruggle with Earl and Bishop the needs and discipline of war should\r\nstrengthen the position of the leaders and tighten their hold on their\r\nfellow-citizens. In 1427 the Twenty-four appear with the name of “the\r\nCommon Council,” ordinances are issued in the name of “the Mayor and\r\nthe Common Council,” and “in open court the Mayor and Bailiffs by\r\nthe assent of the Twenty-four” transact all manner of town business,\r\nwhether it concerned the city franchise, the hearing and carrying out\r\nof the King’s orders, or the voting of money for public purposes.[325]\r\nTo them also undoubtedly Shillingford wrote his long letters from\r\nLondon, respectfully addressing them as the “Fellowship” or “his\r\nFellows,” with whom he was accustomed to take counsel.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary burgesses of Exeter therefore, so far back as we can\r\ntrace its history, played a modest part in city politics, nor had\r\ntheir attempt to assert themselves in 1339 won for them any advantage\r\nwhatever. In 1460 the townsfolk made a new effort of a different and\r\nsingularly interesting kind.\r\n\r\nThere was in Exeter a certain Tailors’ Guild. Its rules, written or\r\ncopied in 1460, ordained that every full tailor worth £20 “shall be\r\nof the Master’s Fellowship and Clothing” and pay as his entrance “a\r\nspoon of silver weighing one ounce and the fashion,” besides buying a\r\nlivery once a year and giving twelve pence to the yearly feast. Other\r\nshop-holders were entered as of the Fellowship of the Bachelors, each\r\npaying 8_d._ to the feast and his offering.[326] There were special\r\ncharges for the “free sewers”; and every servant who took wages\r\nwas also brought into the organization and had to pay his sixpence\r\nyearly to the Guild.[327] The master and wardens sat every Thursday\r\nat nine o’clock to do business, and general meetings of the wardens\r\nand shop-holders were held four times a year, where after they had\r\ndined the free sewers were given the remains of the feast. There was\r\na council of Eight;[328] and the usual rules for protecting the trade\r\nmonopoly, for maintaining discipline, and for collecting funds were\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nSo far the Guild was as other Guilds. But rich, powerful, and well\r\ndrilled, it cherished ambitions beyond the perfecting of the tailors’\r\nart.[329] In the struggle between York and Lancaster, the sympathies of\r\nofficial Exeter were apparently Lancastrian, and when Edward the Fourth\r\ncame to the throne[330] he probably found it politic or necessary, by a\r\ngenerous grant to the Tailors’ Company, to make friends of the trading\r\nclasses that had been left outside the governing caste. By the charter\r\nof incorporation which he allowed them they were granted singular\r\nprivileges, of a kind which the municipal government bitterly resented.\r\nThe charter placed the guild in direct dependence on the King, not\r\non the mayor. They were given a rare liberty—the right “to make\r\nordinances among themselves, as to them might beseem most necessary and\r\nbehovefull for the said fraternity,” and to “make search” and correct\r\nfaults, apparently without need of the mayor’s sanction.[331] Not\r\nonly so, but they obtained authority to “augment and enlarge” their\r\nGuild as they chose; and did forthwith begin daily to take into their\r\ncompany “divers crafts other than of themselves, and divers others not\r\ninhabitants within the same city”—men in fact of every conceivable\r\ntrade and occupation, free brethren who swore to be true and loving\r\nbrothers of the guild, never to go to law with any of the fraternity,\r\nto pay their fines duly during life to the treasure box, and leave a\r\nlegacy to it at their death. The usual rule that no man of the craft\r\ncould be admitted to the freedom of the city save by the consent of the\r\nmaster and wardens gained a new political significance when the bulk\r\nof the inhabitants were thus enrolled under the Tailors’ Guild, and\r\nwhen consequently it was the master of the Tailors who decided what men\r\nshould or should not be made free of the borough.\r\n\r\nFrom this moment the Tailors’ Guild was really a great political\r\nassociation. The Master and Fellowship of the company were scarcely\r\nless powerful than the Mayor and Fellowship of the Corporation. By\r\ntheir right of search the guild officers could enter by day or night\r\nalmost any house in the city or suburbs. By their authority to amend\r\ndefaults they were able to leave the city courts deserted and the city\r\ntreasury empty of its accustomed fines. The granting of citizenship\r\nwas practically in their hands. Their funds and organization\r\nafforded the means for a steady and ordered attack on the governing\r\noligarchy. Taking into their ranks all crafts and all classes, they\r\ngathered into one body the overtaxed and discontented populace whose\r\nanger at the authorities had grown big with long suppression; while\r\nthey also enlisted members that lay beyond the authority of the\r\ncorporation—country people as well as church tenants who, as we know,\r\nwere already murmuring at the assessing of their taxes, and prepared to\r\nmake common cause with the burghers.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the authority of the Mayor over the trades of Exeter\r\nhad been unquestioned. Merchants, grocers, drapers, mercers, the\r\ntailors themselves had been subject to his rule as in other towns; till\r\nby this alarming conspiracy the Mayor and Fellowship found themselves\r\nconfronted with what naturally seemed to them a “great disorderly body”\r\nof revolutionists, who held conventicles and stirred up commotions in\r\nthe town, who even overawed the Mayor and threatened to destroy his\r\nauthority—men of “such evil disposition and unpeaceable that the Mayor\r\nof the said city may not guide and rule the people ... nor correct such\r\ndefaults as ought by him to be correct,” so that “evil example” was\r\n“likely to grow to subversion and destruction of the same city.”[332]\r\nThe royal charter obtained by the Guild was looked upon by the\r\nCorporation as a breach of municipal privilege; and the Guild members\r\nwere required to renounce it by oath or to lose the city franchise;\r\nwhile the Mayor made an example of some of the burgesses who belonged\r\nto the fraternity by striking them off the roll of citizens. The shop\r\nwindows of the refractory were fastened down, and inhabitants were\r\nforbidden to have garments made by certain tailors whose names were set\r\ndown in a black list, “nor with no other of their opinion.” Members of\r\nthe craft who were on the city council were refused the Christmas gifts\r\nof wine and canon bread given to the councillors, and if they held to\r\nthe craft were indeed excluded from the Chamber.[333] On the other hand\r\nif a luckless inhabitant sought to make his peace with the Corporation\r\nby withdrawing from the Tailors, and swearing upon the Crucifix and the\r\nHoly Evangelists to renounce their charter as contrary to the liberties\r\nof the city, the armed brethren of the Guild visited his house and\r\nlevied his contributions by force of arms, that is to say by jacks,\r\ndoublets of defence, swords, bucklers, glaives, and stones.[334] Then\r\nthe town officers retorted by “presenting” the guilty tailors at the\r\nnext court for the crime of riotously collecting fees, and throwing\r\nthem into prison; and so the war went on, evidently at the expense of\r\nthe weakest members of the community.\r\n\r\nPresently however the quarrel was carried beyond the city courts. The\r\nCorporation appealed to Westminster and was once more plunged into\r\nlegal expenses. In 1477 both parties appeared by attorneys before\r\nEdward the Fourth, who used the opportunity of the strife to tighten\r\nthe hold of the central authority both on the town and on the craft.\r\nHe set aside the contention of Exeter that the Corporation had any\r\nexclusive right of granting charters: the Guild had received its\r\nincorporation from the King and this remained valid; and in future all\r\ndisputes between city and guild were to be laid before the King and his\r\nCouncil. But the royal rights being thus secured, the sympathy of the\r\ncentral government veered round to the side of the town as against the\r\ncraft; and the conditions imposed on the Guild if it would preserve\r\nits charter were such as must necessarily break up the organization\r\nin its actual form. The fraternity was cut down again to the limits\r\nof the tailors’ trade, and might enlist no members and make no search\r\namong those of other occupations, nor beyond the city boundaries; and\r\neven within these limits “saving always the franchises of the Mayor\r\nand Commonalty.” It might issue no order against the rights of Bishop\r\nor Mayor: nor might it admit any man to the freedom of the city by\r\nenrolling him in the craft unless he were first presented to the Mayor.\r\nThey suffered indeed a yet further humiliation, for while the Mayor was\r\ngiven the right of refusing to accept a candidate if he were suspected\r\nof not being of good disposition or conversation; yet if the master and\r\nwardens attempted to prevent a man from gaining the freedom of the city\r\nby refusing to testify in his favour and to make him free of the craft,\r\nthe Mayor, bailiffs, and common council might insist on his being\r\naccepted by the Guild.[335]\r\n\r\nProvisions such as these, involving the dissolution of the actual\r\nfraternity as it then existed, the ruin of its political position,\r\nand the end of its control over the roll of burgesses, proclaimed\r\nthe triumph of the municipal authorities; and “the malice and grief\r\nwhich was conceived thereof could not in long time be satisfied or\r\nappeased.” The Guild indeed apparently refused to accept defeat; for\r\nordinances were made in 1479 requiring fresh contributions fixed for\r\nseven years from masters, shop-holders, and free sewers “to the finding\r\nof a priest”[336]—contributions which were assessed so high as to\r\nsuggest some “feigned colour of sanctity” in the desire to provide for\r\na chaplain so unwonted an opulence, in addition to his board at the\r\nMayor’s cost; and which evidently lasted beyond the seven years, since\r\nin 1500 an order was again made that all serving-men, whether working\r\nby the year, by the week, or by the piece, should pay a penny a quarter\r\nto maintain the priest, and at Michaelmas for the wax. The Guild indeed\r\nwas still in good repute and able to hold its own. One of the Tailors\r\nwas Mayor before 1482;[337] and in 1481 the Company arrogantly defied\r\nthe authority of the Corporation. A tailor summoned to choose between\r\nkeeping his place as member of the Guild and retaining the freedom of\r\nthe city solemnly renounced his oath to the Guild before the Mayor,\r\nwhereupon the master and wardens sued him for perjury; so “by the mean\r\nof gentlemen and money” he made peace with them and was again sworn to\r\nthe Guild. But absenting himself from the duties it required of him\r\n“without cause reasonable” he was fetched out of his house, brought\r\nto Tailors’ Hall and set in the stocks, and finally compelled to find\r\nsureties for good conduct in the future.[338] The town councillors of\r\nExeter learned caution from such incidents; and when in this same year\r\nthey granted to the Cordwainers a confirmation of their charter, it was\r\non condition that the master and wardens of the guild should yearly\r\ncome before the Mayor and surrender all their powers, after which on\r\npayment of a fine they should receive them back again by grant of the\r\nMayor.[339] The next year, 1482, when the Bakers desired to have new\r\nordinances,[340] the Corporation stipulated that all corn must be\r\nground in the city mills; that the wardens in making search in bakers’\r\nshops or in hucksters’ houses should always be accompanied by a city\r\nofficer or serjeant; and that if any guild rules were made which were\r\nagainst the city liberties, the Mayor and council might change them at\r\ntheir will.\r\n\r\nThe rebellious Tailors, however, had fought their last battle. In 1482\r\na new petition was laid by the city authorities before Edward the\r\nFourth praying, in spite of the King’s award, for the total abolition\r\nof the Tailors’ charter; and the Twenty-four voted in this and the\r\nfollowing years over £50 for business in Parliament and legal expenses\r\n“touching the annulling of the charter.”[341] From the history of\r\nother towns about this time, it would seem that considerable anxiety\r\nwas beginning to grow up at Court as to the commotions of the populace\r\nand the growth of democracy in the boroughs; the petition was granted\r\nas a matter of course, and the Tailors’ Fraternity sank back into the\r\nsubject position of an ordinary craft guild. Discontent and murmurings\r\nwere still heard in the city streets, but the corporation had no reason\r\nfor fear. In 1496 when one John Atwill was about to be chosen for the\r\nfifth time, “a great division happened amongst the citizens about the\r\nelection of the mayor, and for avoiding the like for the future, was\r\nordered by the mayor and common council hereof, that no man should\r\nbe mayor or bear any office here, nor any election hold good, unless\r\nthe same were held according to the ancient orders and customs of the\r\nsaid city, and withal that the Mayor and four and twenty of the said\r\nCommon Council should elect the Mayor and all other officers of the\r\nsaid city.” To make matters quite safe the city got a charter the next\r\nyear from Henry the Seventh. The new charter did indeed slightly limit\r\nthe claims which the Council had freely set forth in 1496: they were no\r\nlonger allowed to elect the Mayor, but were to choose two candidates\r\nfor the office, one of whom was to be appointed by the freemen; but\r\non the other hand they still retained absolute power to fill up their\r\nown vacancies, and to choose the bailiffs. Their name too was for the\r\nfirst time recognized, and instead of using any longer the old style of\r\nthe city, “the Mayor, Bailiffs, and Commonalty of the city,” the king\r\nlegislated “by the assent and consent of the Common Council.”[342]\r\n\r\nThe Tailors, thus beaten in open fight, could only fall back on the\r\nindirect influence of their wealth and compact majority, and make\r\nalliance with the power which they could not destroy. In 1516 the\r\nMaster of the craft was also Steward of the city, another member was\r\nReceiver or Treasurer, and others were of the Council of Twenty-four;\r\nwhile others again had been Mayors or Treasurers of past years. By the\r\nwill and consent of these officers of City and Guild, the constitution\r\nof the Tailors’ Company was amended, so as to blot out the last trace\r\nof government by the will of the fraternity; and the Eight men, “the\r\nsent of the occupation,” by whose authority laws had once been made\r\nfor the trade, were replaced by a council of those who had once been\r\nmasters of the craft, to be summoned by the Master.[343] The full\r\nsignificance of this step can only be understood by taking it in\r\nconnexion with the position which was at this time being given to\r\n“the Clothing” in municipal government.[344] But it is plain that the\r\nancient strife was now closed by a division of the spoils of power; and\r\nthe sorrows of defeat were left to the populace at large. These lay\r\nmore hopelessly than before at the mercy of their rulers, for masters\r\nof crafts when they controlled town government had a double reason\r\nfor maintaining the authority of the corporation—the instinct of the\r\nmaster tradesman and the instinct of the town councillor.\r\n\r\nThe story of Exeter is invaluable from the light it throws on the\r\nmutual attitude of town and craft in the struggle for autonomy. Nothing\r\nis more intelligible than the passionate resistance of a corporation\r\nto royal charters given over the heads of the town officers,[345] if\r\nwe realize the quick alarms to which a municipality which had had\r\nexperience of the long fight for supremacy with king and church and\r\nbaron, was liable when it saw a new enemy, an enemy which it had long\r\nsupposed vanquished, springing up in its very midst to threaten with\r\na fresh danger the unity of the borough. It was speedily discovered\r\nhow great an internal weakness must follow from this cleavage in\r\nthe political society of the towns; and how the very appeals for\r\narbitration to the State, and the interference of King and Parliament,\r\nmust constantly tend yet further to limit municipal independence; while\r\nthere were other hints of danger in the new chances offered for the\r\ncountry gentry to interfere with the independence of the town life,\r\nwhen they could make the guild, detached from the town, an engine for\r\ntheir own political projects.[346] Even for the guilds themselves,\r\nthere were to be set against the advantages, whatever these amounted\r\nto, which they actually won by emancipation, grave dangers for the\r\nfuture—dangers from the difficulty of enforcing discipline without\r\ngovernment support; from the hostility of the corporation and the\r\nannoyances it could inflict by rendering honour to their most unruly\r\nmembers; and from the encouragement given to a more aggressive\r\nanimosity on the part of other companies, rivals in independence and\r\ndetermined foes in monopoly.[347] The emancipation of the greater\r\ntrading companies from local control may have been a necessary step in\r\nsetting free a growing national commerce; but it was the evident sign\r\nthat the age of municipal freedom and local self-government had entered\r\non its decline.\r\n\r\nUsually, however, it seems that the big trading companies had their own\r\nmethods of making terms with authority, or of leading the corporation\r\ncaptive and peacefully installing themselves in the place of power;\r\nas we may see in the case of the great merchant fraternities and\r\nwholesale dealers who, like the Drapers and Mercers of Coventry,\r\nthe Drapers of Shrewsbury, and possibly guilds of the same kind at\r\nWalsall,[348] had made of their combinations the dictators of the\r\ncivic administration. But commercial unions such as these, standing in\r\na group by themselves, somewhat apart from the Exeter Tailors, must be\r\nseparately considered. The Tailors’ fraternity may perhaps be taken as\r\nholding a sort of intermediate position—on one side figuring almost\r\nas a merchant company, and on the other as an ordinary manufacturing\r\ncraft; and it is in this second aspect that its history indicates\r\nto us the very important part which the trades played in rallying\r\nthe elements of revolt, drilling their forces, and lending the guild\r\norganization for the strife. No single instance can ever be taken as\r\nin any way typical or representative, for everywhere the position of\r\nthe crafts resolves itself into questions of local circumstances, and\r\nof delicate changes from place to place in the balance of conflicting\r\nforces. Whether there was any town under normal conditions in which\r\nsuccessful resistance was made to a governing oligarchy save with\r\nthe help of a good craft organization we cannot as yet say. In every\r\nborough there seem to have been disputes, more or less acute, between\r\nthe governing and the governed, whether the conflict took the form\r\nof the attack and defence of a close corporation as at Exeter; or of\r\na powerful guild merchant controlling the corporation as at Lynn;\r\nor of the great mercantile fraternities as at Coventry. And in some\r\nboroughs in which the commons succeeded in modifying the old oligarchic\r\nsystem, we can certainly trace the direct action of the manufacturing\r\ncrafts. Occasionally the working trades rose against the merchant\r\nsocieties, and forced their way into the Council Chamber. In Carlisle\r\nthe Merchant Guild, while remaining distinct from the municipal body,\r\ngave to the town more mayors and aldermen than any other guild; and as\r\nit admitted no strangers to membership of its society “for no money\r\nwhatsoever”[349] its posts and honours became practically hereditary,\r\nuntil eight crafts or occupations of the town (seven of them being\r\nunions of artificers, and the eighth a union of shopkeepers, seedsmen,\r\napothecaries, haberdashers, and so on) put an end to this despotism\r\nin the sixteenth century by creating a council of thirty-two, four\r\nfrom each trade, who joined the council of the mayor and aldermen, and\r\nclaiming to act in the name of the whole community took part in making\r\nbye-laws; in choosing the “out-men” who were to be made burgesses;\r\nin auditing accounts; in removing the town officers if necessary;\r\nand in keeping the keys of the common chest.[350] That such powers\r\nas these were voluntarily or even quite peaceably handed over by the\r\nruling guild is conceivable, though its improbability is shewn by\r\nall analogy. In Newcastle it was after “great commotions, unlawful\r\nassemblies, confederacies,” and general riots that the mercers,\r\ndrapers, and corn-dealers were forced in 1516 to admit nine other\r\ncrafts to share with them the government.[351] In Norwich, where it\r\nwas found possible even for guilds proscribed and forbidden to force\r\nan honourable compromise with their opponents, the settlement was\r\nonly brought about after discords by which the city was “divided and\r\ndissolved and in point to have been destroyed.”[352] When Edward the\r\nFourth, in 1464, sent a royal patent to York ordering that for the\r\nfuture the craftsmen of the trades should nominate two aldermen, one of\r\nwhom was to be chosen mayor, the action must imply that there had been\r\ndissension in the city society, out of which the king perhaps hoped to\r\nmake his profit[353] by attaching to himself an important faction in\r\nthe community. No doubt there were many cases where the trades had to\r\nconfess the entire failure of their attempts, or where their success\r\nwas but partial, as in London where the crafts would willingly have\r\nincreased their influence if popular opinion could have been taken\r\nout of the way.[354] In a great number of boroughs we know that the\r\ncrafts insisted that the only way to the municipal franchise should\r\nlie through their societies;[355] but to what extent this condition\r\nprevailed, to what political uses it was put, and how far it served\r\nas a trial of strength between parties in power and revolutionary\r\nfactions, are as yet only matters of guess-work.\r\n\r\nThe scanty state of our knowledge indeed makes it impossible to sum\r\nup in a phrase the character of a strife which was universal, which\r\ninvolved every class in a most complicated and highly organized\r\nindustrial society, and of which the history has not yet been fully\r\nmade out for a single borough. But so far as our evidence yet goes, the\r\ndevelopement of municipal government involved everywhere a struggle\r\nbetween the classes triumphant and the classes put under subjection.\r\nTo discuss whether the subject class who attempted to create new\r\nassociations or use old ones to fight their battles, were mere common\r\nburgesses contending with a municipal corporation, or bodies of\r\nartificers resisting a guild of merchants, or an indiscriminate mob\r\nopposed to a religious fraternity of the Holy Trinity or the Holy\r\nCross, is often a mere juggling with words. For as we shall see, it was\r\npossible for one group of men to bear the three names, and in their\r\ncharacter of “magnates” or “potentiores” to act not only as the Town\r\nCouncil but also as the Guild Merchant; and to shelter both functions\r\nunder a specious colour of sanctity. Under such circumstances it is of\r\nno great consequence under which name they fought, nor by what name\r\nthey called the mob, whether commonalty or another; since no change\r\nin their nominal relations materially affected the attitude of men\r\nin power towards those outside, or the policy of merchant and master\r\ntradesmen towards the working people. We must always remember, too,\r\nin discussing the social changes that took place in England, that\r\nthe absence of violent dramatic effects, the limited and provincial\r\ncharacter of the contests of classes, were but necessary consequences\r\nof the conditions of English life, at a time when industrial and\r\npolitical disputes were carried on by the local forces of every little\r\ntown independently, in a series of particular conflicts fought out with\r\nvarying success by groups of combatants trained in small detachments\r\nfor separate service. It would be too much to imagine, because we\r\nread of no open war of classes, no burning of towns or insurrections\r\nquenched in blood, that the whole industrial society of mediæval\r\nEngland moved together in a harmonious and orderly progression, each\r\nnew group as it arrived being peacefully lifted to its destined place\r\nin wealth and council, without the jealousy of predecessors, or the\r\nbitter grudge of after-comers. On the contrary all evidence goes to\r\nshow that the tenacity of Englishmen in holding to power, and their\r\nstubbornness in insisting on freedom, were as characteristic of the\r\nrace in the fifteenth as in the nineteenth century; that antagonism\r\nbetween the man who asks and the man who pays a wage, were very much\r\nthe same as now; and that class interests were if anything far more\r\npowerful. If therefore we suppose the social and political developement\r\nof the later middle-ages in this country was naturally brought about\r\nby the logical sequence of economic developement, we must allow that\r\nstern sequence to include then, as it would include now, the passionate\r\nefforts of a strong people to turn aside by their might the impending\r\ncalamities of fate, and to lay a violent grasp on her uncertain\r\nbenefactions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE GUILD MERCHANT\r\n\r\n\r\nIN the conflicts of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries we see the\r\ntown society rent into two factions; and whether the contending groups\r\ncall themselves the Burghers and Commonalty, or “the rich” and “the\r\npoor people of the city,” or the Merchant Guild and the Crafts, or by\r\nany other names, they seem practically to represent the same broad\r\nsections of the community. In town quarrels it is hard for us to draw\r\nany valid distinction between groups of citizens and companies of\r\ncraftsmen, as though they were led by different passions; for however\r\nnumerous were the mere inhabitants who must have lain outside the\r\norganization of the crafts, usually every freeman was a member of some\r\ncompany, and the whole voting population was thus enrolled under the\r\nbanners of the various trades. The real line of cleavage on which we\r\nhave to concentrate attention is not the thin line which may be drawn\r\nbetween the Town Council and the Merchant Guild, the Commonalty and the\r\nCrafts, but rather the broad chasm which breaks the whole industrial\r\nsociety itself into two factions—on the one side the merchant traders,\r\non the other the artificers and small retail dealers. Wherever the\r\nlesser crafts who represented the middle classes of the borough, and\r\nwhose interests were more or less identified with the cause of the\r\ncommons and “poor people of the city,” were forcing their claim to a\r\nshare in the counsels of the town; to which their way was barred by a\r\nsolid phalanx of hereditary “magnates” and wealthy merchants who had\r\nabandoned the meaner employments of trade and thrown in their lot with\r\nthe governing oligarchy of “the rich,” and who fought in alliance with\r\nor under cover of the burghers; there the revolt of the commons against\r\nthe Town Council becomes practically a battle of the working crafts\r\nagainst the rule of the mercantile fraternities—a battle which may be\r\nfought at one time for the winning of civic privileges, at another for\r\nindustrial freedom.\r\n\r\nIf we ask how old this conflict was, and at what time the peace of the\r\ntown was first disturbed by the antagonism of the greater commerce and\r\nthe lesser crafts, of the trader and the artificer, we must go back for\r\nan answer to the very much earlier period when commercial societies\r\nfirst became organized, or at least to the twelfth century when the\r\nMerchant Guild and the Crafts come prominently to the front.[356]\r\nUnfortunately the history of the Guild Merchant,[357] from its obscure\r\nbeginnings in the days of the Confessor, or of the Norman kings, down\r\nto the time when its organization had spread all over England, and its\r\nfraternities were to be found in most of the trading boroughs, is still\r\nenveloped in the darkness which covers the early records of our towns,\r\nand problems await solution which involve the whole developement of\r\nthe Guild. We know that from a remote period men had banded themselves\r\ntogether in associations to secure protection and monopoly of trade,\r\nand before the close of the twelfth century the majority of trading\r\ntowns had each its “Merchant Guild” with rights guaranteed by royal\r\ncharter. First born into life in a society where a merchant class such\r\nas we understand it was unknown, we are told that the Guild may have\r\nfirst consisted mainly of agriculturists busied in tilling their common\r\nlands, and increasing their herds of cows and sheep and pigs; and whose\r\nchief anxiety was to sell the butter and honey and salt meat and wool\r\nthat remained over when they had supplied their own wants, and to buy\r\nfish for the fasting seasons, ploughs and spades for their fields and\r\nthe simplest furniture for their humble households. But, in the opinion\r\nof its latest historian, from the twelfth century artizans were freely\r\nadmitted to its society, and presently formed the majority of the\r\nGuild[358]—each craftsman being a small trader on his own account,\r\nbuying his raw material, and selling his manufactured goods at the\r\nstall he rented in the market or on the folding shelf that he let\r\ndown to the street from the window of his little workroom. With these\r\nwere clergy and women who busied themselves in trade;[359] travelling\r\ndealers among the townsfolk to whom exemptions from jurisdictions\r\noutside the town and freedom from toll were important (things which\r\nmattered little to the homekeeping citizens); and strangers who\r\nbrought their wares to the town market,[360] paid their entrance fee\r\nand pledged themselves to bear henceforth their share of the town\r\ntaxes, though they were considered free from all other charges that\r\nlay on the “downlying and uprising and pot-boiling” householders.\r\nIt is therefore supposed that when the time came for the Guild to\r\nemerge from its humble state of private association, and rise into\r\nthe dignity of an official civic body, charged with the protection of\r\nthe trading interests of the borough,[361] it formed a really popular\r\ninstitution, which from its very nature could never become entangled\r\nin a conflict with the crafts—an organization of the whole community\r\nfor the control of trade by the common consent of the people, which was\r\nin many respects peculiarly characteristic of English life,[362] and\r\nwhich was the natural product of an age of freedom before the people\r\nhad been trodden under foot of a despotic oligarchy. Theoretically\r\nsubject to the authority of the town as part of its regular\r\nadministrative machinery,[363] but ruled over by its own officers, and\r\nexercising independent jurisdiction through its voluntary tribunals\r\nof arbitration, the Guild by virtue of its trade monopoly,[364] its\r\npowerful organization and discipline, and the fact that the men who\r\nformed its governing body were generally the same as those who sat on\r\nthe governing body of the borough, maintained a far more independent\r\nposition than any department of town government to-day.[365]\r\n\r\nBut according to Dr. Gross the Gilda Mercatoria was doomed to vanish\r\naway before the growth of new industrial conditions. The first blow\r\nwas struck at its supremacy by the appearance early in the twelfth\r\ncentury of crafts, which bought from the king the right to exist as\r\nindependent fraternities during his pleasure.[366] From this time the\r\ndecline of the Merchant Guild from its old estate kept pace with the\r\ncommercial revolution that caused its ruin. It began to undergo its\r\ngreat change at the close of the thirteenth century, and in the two\r\nfollowing centuries it may be said to have practically ceased to exist.\r\nBroken up into a multitude of independent associations, each of which\r\ncarried on business for itself,[367] deprived of all its old functions,\r\nit died because it had no longer any adequate reason to live. Perhaps\r\nit lingered on here and there in agricultural towns where few or no\r\ncraft guilds had been formed;[368] or in ecclesiastical boroughs where\r\nits organization provided the only rallying point for the community in\r\nany struggle for freedom; but everywhere else its machinery fell to\r\npieces;[369] and so completely did it vanish away as a distinct body\r\nthat the very name only survived by taking to itself new meanings.\r\nSometimes the old Merchant Guild became indistinguishably blended\r\nwith the town and gave its name to the whole community;[370] though\r\nin another place it perhaps handed over name and functions to the\r\nnarrow select governing body of the borough as distinguished from the\r\ngeneral community of citizens.[371] Elsewhere its title was in some\r\nvague way transferred to the aggregate of the craft guilds.[372] As a\r\nmere shadow of its former self, with nothing but the word to mark its\r\nidentity, the Merchant Guild might survive as a simple social-religious\r\nfraternity;[373] or perhaps without conflict or bitterness it merely\r\nfaded away before the crafts, leaving not so much as a name behind\r\nit.[374] But however the implicit, unspoken compact was carried out,\r\nby whatever means the Gilda Mercatoria, obedient to a final destiny,\r\neffected its renunciation of an inconvenient supremacy, there was\r\nno possible occasion left for strife between Guild and crafts,[375]\r\nand the suggestion of any such quarrel, or of revolt on the part of\r\nthe crafts against the superior fraternity from the twelfth to the\r\nfifteenth centuries, must be looked on as a wanton “myth”.[376] Having\r\nfulfilled its course the Merchant Guild took its doom without noise or\r\nstruggle, and entered decently into the shades with a grave decorum\r\nbefore which jarring sounds of contention were put to silence. It was\r\nat a later time, when the old popular organization had died, that the\r\nharmony of the commons was destroyed by the coming in of a tyranny\r\nunknown till then—the tyranny of a select and irresponsible governing\r\nbody which by its corrupt administration stirred up a new spirit of\r\ndissension in the boroughs.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately this picture of the successive stages of the guild\r\nhistory, from the free republican period through which they are all\r\napparently supposed to have passed, down to their extinction or\r\nabsorption into a governing oligarchy, a whole borough community, or a\r\ngroup of trades, has not been verified by following out the continuous\r\nstory of any single guild. Moreover it would seem that the difficulty\r\nof making any general statement about the groups of traders who made\r\nthe fortunes of the English boroughs, is as great as the difficulty of\r\nmaking a general statement as to the position and grouping of a host\r\nof irregular troops in rapid march over a tangled country. Amid the\r\nintense activity and the transformation scenes of mediæval life there\r\nis no exact definition which does not prove false with a little lapse\r\nof time, a little change of place; and theories of “natural tendency”\r\nare but as traps set for the unwary. So far as the Guild Merchant\r\nis concerned, there were probably as many various exceptions to any\r\ngeneral rule as there were towns which contained a Guild. Let but a\r\ngeneration pass away and the institution is perhaps wholly changed;\r\nhere it existed in some special form; a few miles off it never existed\r\nat all; in some boroughs it dominated the history of the town, while\r\nin others it left but the bare echo of its name behind.[377] There may\r\npossibly have been towns where at one time the Guild included within\r\nits ranks the majority of the burghers, and perhaps mainly consisted of\r\ncraftsmen;[378] but there were evidently others where from the first\r\nit formed a society far narrower and more restricted,[379] or where\r\nit rapidly tended to become a limited body of wealthy citizens out\r\nof whose midst the craft guilds cannot possibly have been developed;\r\nwhile occasionally it may have happened that the craft guilds preceded\r\nthe Merchant Guild.[380] Even if the theory was ostensibly maintained\r\nthat craftsmen “were freely enrolled among the members of the Guild\r\nMerchant”[381]—in practice “gifts and entrance fees of a collation, a\r\nbull, beer, and wine” could effectually keep out the poorer sort, and\r\nallow the association[382] to develope rapidly into an exclusive and\r\ncomparatively aristocratic society, which demanded from all save owners\r\nof a house or burgage, or men entitled by direct descent to belong to\r\nthe fraternity, admission fees big enough to guarantee the new comer’s\r\nfitness to be of their fine company. The two ranks established in the\r\nAndover Guild[383] as early as the thirteenth century suggest how\r\nprivilege might creep in even among Guild members themselves; as the\r\nmerchants of Bristol teach us how it could be fought for;[384] and\r\nthere is no doubt that the policy of each separate fraternity must\r\nhave largely depended on whether it adopted the custom of having its\r\nofficers chosen by consent of the whole community of Guildsmen,[385]\r\nor by a handful of electors of the superior class.[386] Even if a\r\nconsiderable number of burghers was admitted to trading privileges, it\r\nby no means follows that they were allowed any voice in the control of\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nNor are we less in the dark as to that “natural process” by which the\r\nGuild is believed to have passed to its resigned and painless end. The\r\n“transference of authority from the ancient general Guild Merchant to a\r\nnumber of distinct bodies and the consequent disintegration and decay\r\nof the former,”[387] the weakening of its strength by the creation\r\nof new crafts, the splitting up of its monopoly into fragments, the\r\nannihilation of its original being to make place for “the aggregate of\r\nthe crafts,” the turning of the Guild into a “simple social-religious\r\nfraternity”—a kind of quiet haven of rest for wealthy merchants who\r\nhad given up the sweets of power and the real government of trade in\r\nwhich their fortunes were concerned, to busy themselves with dirges\r\nand masses and chaplains, or even with a Corpus Christi procession—in\r\nfact the whole “gradual and spontaneous” movement in which lay the\r\ndeath of the primitive fraternity is still enveloped in mystery. If\r\ncraftsmen, associated in their own peculiar guilds, yet remained in\r\nthe common Guild Merchant[388] which had once made regulations for\r\ntheir trade, and in many cases still did so,[389] the instances (apart\r\nfrom cases where the Guild Merchant either was the municipal body,\r\nor had simply handed over to it its name) are rare or perhaps unknown\r\nin the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries; nor can we easily follow\r\nthe far more complicated transformation said to have taken place when\r\nthe burgesses became the heirs of the general body of guildsmen,\r\nby a double process which changed the idea of citizenship from the\r\nconception of the freeman holding a burgage tenure into the later\r\nidea of a man holding the right to exercise a trade, and which turned\r\nthe governors of the guild into the rulers of the town;[390] so that\r\nby natural growth the fraternity of the Guild Merchant, once wholly\r\ndistinct from the borough, became identical with it.[391]\r\n\r\nIt is very possible—indeed it is very probable if we remember the\r\nthrift of the English people in politics, their habit of fetching out\r\nthe old machinery whenever there seems a chance of making it useful;\r\ntheir aversion to repairs or patches beyond what imperative necessity\r\ndemands; their indifference to new inventions if the old wheels and\r\ncranks can still be induced to turn—that we may learn something of\r\nthe working of the original Guild Merchant by watching the doings of\r\nits successors in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. For whether\r\nthe primitive Guild had ceased to exist or no, something going by its\r\nname and clothed in its form confronts us constantly in the later\r\ntimes, soberly masquerading in an ancient habit which seems scarcely\r\nthe worse for wear or out of fashion for all the lapse of centuries;\r\nand figuring before us as a robust survival, as an old organization\r\nfitted out afresh for a pressing emergency, or even as a new creation.\r\nWe may watch in Coventry such a Guild, which bears none of the signs\r\nof decrepitude or symptoms of decay—a guild which was in no sense a\r\nsimple social-religious fraternity, nor yet an ordinary craft guild;\r\nwhich was far from being an aggregate of the trades; which refused to\r\nthe lesser crafts the right to combine, and despotically governed their\r\nbusiness in its own interests; which was the municipal body of the\r\ncity and carried on its entire administration, but never gave its name\r\neither to the community or to the governing body; anti-democratic in\r\nits origin, in its maturity, and in its old age; jealous of dominion;\r\nincapable of making terms from behind its barricaded doors with\r\ndissolution. Late as was its date, it has features in its origin, its\r\nconstitution, and its policy far too like those of much earlier guilds,\r\nnot to claim our interest.[392]\r\n\r\nBorn two or three hundred years out of due time (for it was not till\r\nQueen Isabella became owner of part of Coventry and interested in\r\ndefending her tenants’ rights against the Prior, that the city was\r\nable to obtain the grant of a Gilda Mercatoria), it was only in 1340\r\nthat the Merchant Guild of S. Mary’s was founded[393]—an association\r\napparently of dealers in cloth, wool, and general merchandise.[394]\r\nEven then it failed to secure license to mortmain, perhaps through the\r\nresistance of the Prior, the lord of the soil; but it is possible that\r\nthe charter of incorporation for the town, granted in 1344, was bought\r\nby the Guild, and at least as early as 1347 and 1350 two of its masters\r\nwere mayors; while the Town Hall, where the mayor and council met and\r\nwhere the chest containing the town treasure and the charter were kept,\r\nalways bore the name of S. Mary’s Guild.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime two other societies had sprung up—the guild of S.\r\nJohn Baptist[395] in 1342, and the guild of S. Catherine in 1343—and\r\nthe three companies of S. Mary, S. John, and S. Catherine united into\r\none body between 1364 and 1369; and finally joined themselves to the\r\nTrinity Guild, which had received license to mortmain in 1364, and gave\r\nits name to the whole association.[396] Considerable property was\r\nhanded over in trust for the combined societies to six of the chief\r\ncitizens of the town, most of whom had been mayors several times, and\r\none of whom had been founder of S. John’s Guild. From this time the\r\nhistory of the municipality is the history of its leading guilds; and\r\nthe further step taken in 1392, when the four guilds were more formally\r\nunited by a patent of incorporation, and when fresh donations of land\r\nwere given to the whole body, was only a fortifying of the position\r\nwhich it already held.\r\n\r\nThough the name of the Merchant Guild was sacrificed, doubtless for\r\nsome sufficient reason, the Trinity Guild was nothing more than an\r\nextension of the primitive association under a new title. The founders\r\nand donors and the early mayors are usually classed together as\r\n“mercatores” in the deeds, and the union seems to have represented the\r\nwealthy upper class (drapers and mercers for the most part, with a few\r\nleading members of other trades),[397] living in S. Michael’s parish,\r\nof which Queen Isabella and her successors were the owners. Only one\r\nother society was allowed to exist alongside of it,—the fraternity\r\nof rich traders in Trinity parish (the Prior’s half of the town), who\r\nwere in 1348 licensed to form the Corpus Christi Guild. Drawn from the\r\nsame rank, sharing the same interests, they cast in their lot with the\r\nmerchants of the neighbouring parish, contributed to the general town\r\nexpenses, and were admitted to a corresponding degree of influence in\r\nthe municipal government.[398]\r\n\r\nFor the Trinity and Corpus Christi Guilds were in fact the governing\r\nbody of the town. According to the general custom the Master of the\r\nCorpus Christi Guild was made Mayor in the second year after his laying\r\ndown that post, and two years after his mayoralty he was set at the\r\nhead of the Trinity Guild.[399] All important town officials were\r\nsworn members of both the great companies; so were the Leet Jury and\r\nthe Twenty-four who elected the mayor (these two bodies consisting of\r\nalmost the same individuals); and so were all the men who might be\r\nsummoned on the Mayor’s Council to aid the Twenty-four. By this simple\r\ndevice, the fear of an alien party being formed in the Council was once\r\nfor all banished; for if the Corpus Christi Guild held its elections\r\nin the Bishop’s palace[400] and had its centre in Trinity Church on\r\nthe Prior’s land,—if its members included the Prior and his bailiff,\r\nthe vicar, and strangers, some of them of great estate, from near and\r\nfar[401]—all dangerous elements were made harmless by the order that\r\nnone of its members should meddle with town affairs unless he had been\r\nfirst approved and accepted by the Trinity Guild. The Corpus Christi\r\nfraternity in fact was admitted to its position by a sort of cautious\r\nsufferance, and all real power lay with the Guild of the Trinity. Its\r\nmaster was a Justice of the Peace, and therefore took a leading part\r\nin all the most important business of the courts; he was first on the\r\nlist of the Twenty-four who elected the mayor and who also sat at\r\nthe Leet Court. Invariably he was one of the five men chosen by the\r\nmayor to keep the keys of the common chest—being, in fact, in matters\r\nof finance supreme; for at the end of the mayor’s year of office it\r\nwas to the master that he delivered up his accounts and his balance\r\n“and is quit”; and the Guild was not only charged with the payment of\r\nsalaries to public officials—the recorder, the grammar-school master,\r\nthe priests in the Lady Chapel of S. Michael’s, and the warden and\r\npriests at Bablake—but as early as 1384 it was ordered by the Leet to\r\npay yearly the ferm to the Prior, in return for which a certain part\r\nof the common lands was made over into its possession. The keeping of\r\nBablake Gate was committed to it; and it was given possession of the\r\nDrapery Hall, which was used as the cloth mart under the control of the\r\nmunicipality.[402]\r\n\r\nBut this great society, known on the one side as the Trinity Guild,\r\non the other as the Town Corporation, owed in neither aspect anything\r\nwhatever to popular election,[403] and made no pretence at government\r\naccording to the will of the people.[404] From the very moment of the\r\nfirst union of the fraternities the story of revolt among the 7,000\r\nworkers who thronged the streets of Coventry begins, and is repeated\r\nfrom generation to generation for the next hundred and fifty years.\r\nIncessant riots declared the discontent of the commons at the light\r\nloaves sold under mayors who neglected to keep the assize of bread,\r\nat false measures allowed for selling corn, at the encroachments on\r\ncommon lands by chamberlains and councillors, at the government of\r\ntrade by the drapers and mercers enrolled in the two great guilds\r\nof the city, while weavers, shearmen, fullers, and tailors, lying\r\nfor the most part outside these guilds, had little hope of ever\r\nrising to municipal power.[405] The crafts, in fact, were kept in\r\nuncompromising subjection. When the fullers and tailors tried to set up\r\na fraternity,[406] the ruling guilds obtained a charter in 1407 which\r\nforbade the creation of any other society than their own. They had this\r\ngrant confirmed in 1414; and the next year they appealed to Parliament\r\nagainst the dyers[407] who endeavoured to form a confederation of\r\ncloth-makers and wool-sellers. S. George’s Guild—a union of the\r\n“young men, serving men of the tailors and other artificers, and\r\nlabourers working by the day called journeymen,” who defiantly gathered\r\nin S. George’s Chapel and elected “masters and clerks and other\r\nofficials to fulfil their youthful and insolent desires,” and “abet\r\neach other in their quarrels”—was put down because it was “to the\r\nruin and destruction of the Guilds of Holy Trinity and Corpus Christi\r\nand disturbance of all the community.”[408] Though the fullers and\r\ntailors once more obtained license in 1438 to hold property, their\r\nunion was broken up in the next ten years;[409] and the persistence\r\nof the dyers in clinging to their illegal combinations was opposed\r\nin 1475 by an ordinance that unlawful writings and oaths made by\r\ndyers and other crafts were to be “void, quashed, and annulled,”\r\nand members of the craft should not be sued for not observing these\r\nillegal ordinances.[410] Circuitous attempts to win independence by\r\ninformally setting up voluntary tribunals where the members of the\r\ntrade assembled to settle disputes, were met by the order that no\r\nmasters of crafts should sue any of their craft in any kind of suit\r\nin special courts until the mayor have heard the matter and licensed\r\nthe suit; on the plea that “discord falls out continually because\r\nmasters of crafts sue in special courts divers people of their crafts,\r\naffirming they have broken their oaths made in breaking divers rules,\r\nwhich rules are ofttimes unreasonable, and the punishment of the said\r\nmasters excessive, which, if it continue, by likelihood will cause\r\nmuch people to void out of this city.”[411] With regard to customs on\r\nwool, or the conditions of sale for the coarse cloth of the people, or\r\nthe regulations for apprentices, the merchants passed laws which drove\r\nthe commons to impotent fury;[412] and the wild dreams of revolution\r\nthat passed from street to street for the century after John Ball found\r\nhis hiding-place in the lanes of Coventry, are told in the rhymes\r\nnailed by the people on the church door side by side with the official\r\nannouncements, where we hear their passionate outcry for the freedom\r\nof the good old days of Godiva, and threats of a time when the “littel\r\nsmall been” and “wappys” should “also sting”;[413] or in the teaching\r\nof the leader of the populace that the city would have no peace till\r\nthree or four of the churls that ruled them had their heads stricken\r\noff.\r\n\r\nBut if the Trinity Guild was in this complete sense the governing body\r\nof the town—if its legislation was at once so characteristic and so\r\nirresistible—by what strange access of modesty was it restrained from\r\ntaking to itself the glory, and letting its name blot out all others\r\non the city roll?[414] Such renunciation, we can scarcely doubt,\r\nwhether in Coventry or in other places where the problem presents\r\nitself, was more likely to spring from the “grace of guile” than\r\nfrom modesty. From the point of view of worldly wisdom, indeed, the\r\narguments for a diplomatic self-effacement were overwhelming; for\r\nit was easy to discern the dangers to its hoarded treasure which a\r\nguild must incur from the moment when in the eyes of the law or of\r\nits officers it became confounded with the municipality. Safety lay\r\nin silence, and if the name of the guild lingered in the Guildhall,\r\nit did not pass the precincts; while by a wise precaution the actual\r\nmayor of the borough was never allowed to be the same person as the\r\nactual master of the guild,[415] lest the higher authorities should in\r\nsome emergency make an easy confusion between the keys with which he\r\nopened the treasure-box of the community, and those which unlocked the\r\ncoffers of the guild.[416] If there were any doubt before 1392[417]\r\nabout the meaning of thus carefully preserving the double aspect of\r\nthe fraternity, there seems but little after it. For in that year when\r\nthe Coventry Guild got its new formal patent and its increased income,\r\nit was only following a somewhat common fashion of the day.[418] In\r\n1392 the bailiffs and commonalty of Birmingham obtained leave to have\r\ntheir Guild of the Holy Cross—“a guild and brotherhood of bretheren\r\nand sisteren among themselves in that town ... and men and women\r\nwell disposed in other towns and in the neighbourhood”—which might\r\nhold lands in mortmain, and which was intimately connected with the\r\ngoverning body of the town. The Town Hall or Guild Hall was built by\r\nit, and charities were distributed “according to the ordering and will\r\nof the bailiffs and commonalty”; and it “kept in good reparacioune two\r\ngreat stone bridges and divers foul and dangerous highways, the charge\r\nwhereof the town of itself is not able to maintain.”[419] In the same\r\nyear, 1392, “the seneschalls of the Guild Merchant of Bridgewater and\r\nof the community of the same town” obtained a grant to assign certain\r\nlands in mortmain,[420] and an indenture which probably belongs to the\r\nbeginning of the reign of Edward the First[421] proves that there was a\r\nclose relation of this guild on one side to the fraternity of S. Mary\r\nor of the Holy Cross, and on the other to the corporation of the town.\r\nThe brotherhood of the Holy Cross at Abingdon, which was established\r\nunder Richard the Second, seems to have been practically the governing\r\nbody of the borough, owned most of the landed property in the town in\r\nthe fifteenth century, and spent money liberally in the building of\r\nchurches and the market cross.[422]\r\n\r\nSuch guilds as these seem to have been the quick retort of the towns\r\nto the Act of 1391, which for the first time extended to cities and\r\nboroughs the Statute of Mortmain passed in 1279, and placed them\r\nin a position where they could thenceforth boast of no advantage\r\nover religious corporations, and like them had to buy leave to hold\r\nproperty. But it seemed beyond the wit of man to put English traders\r\ninto a difficulty which was not by their very touch turned into a new\r\nopportunity for gain. If right to hold corporate property must now be\r\nbought, whatever claimant appeared, then why should it not be bought\r\nby a private society of merchants, sheltered under the Holy Cross or\r\nthe Trinity, rather than by the town community or the burgesses? On\r\nthe one hand the leading citizens, the intelligent and prosperous\r\nmen of the town, thus secured an indestructible claim to guide its\r\nfortunes aright; on the other hand the town funds were by the same\r\nmeasure garnered once for all in a safe hiding-place—in other words,\r\nif troublesome officers from the exchequer should come with demands\r\nfor inconvenient rent or forfeitures, they were met by the fact that\r\nthe men of the town _had_ nothing, while the men of the guild _owed_\r\nnothing. The system seems to have worked as effectively as the British\r\nconstitution itself. We know that the Coventry Guild, besides the\r\nproperty it already held, had taken over yet more at its incorporation\r\nin 1392. But in 1468, Coventry being then the fourth city in the\r\nkingdom, it was £800 in arrears for its ferm; and since the goods of\r\n“the mayor and men of Coventry” only amounted to 106_s._, and since the\r\nsaid “mayor and men” had no other goods or lands within the bailiwick\r\nthat could be taken into the king’s hands, no further payment was then\r\nmade.[423] If we remember the wealth of the Trinity and Corpus Christi\r\nGuilds, the fact that they probably held the main portion of the common\r\nproperty,[424] and their close connexion with the city government,[425]\r\nit is plain that the town was doing very good business in withdrawing\r\nits funds from the reach of the king’s officers; and that the traders\r\nhad adequately realized their purpose in setting up in their Townhall\r\none of those familiar companies which was admitted at home to be in\r\neffect the corporation, but which was officially known at Westminster\r\nonly as a “simple” social-religious fraternity that yearly carried S.\r\nGeorge and his Dragon or some other poetic emblem through the streets\r\nwith solemn festival, or kept great tendrilles of wax burning before\r\nthe Holy Cross in the parish church.\r\n\r\nThat the Trinity society of Coventry was not the last of these astute\r\nfraternities of traders we know;[426] that it was not the first we\r\nmay safely believe. Indeed, it might well have been modelled on the\r\nfraternity of the Trinity at Lynn[427]—an older company by a hundred\r\nand fifty years, whose members would at no time have found any trouble\r\nin discussing the secrets of their policy with the merchants of\r\nCoventry. It may be that the texture of society was never so simple\r\nor so uniform as historians have believed, that the humble mediæval\r\nmerchant loomed big in the eyes of his yet humbler fellow-citizens,\r\nand that in many a trading town the Guild Merchant was the monument\r\nof the successful capitalists of the village, and of a triumph so\r\ncomplete that the petty details of its progress fell out of memory.\r\nHow many typical forms the early guild may have taken from town to\r\ntown, as it squeezed its way with or without a welcome into communities\r\nof every shape and consistence, we have not yet materials to say;\r\nnor do we yet know by what varieties of compact it may have become\r\nthe indispensable minister or the master of the municipal authority;\r\nor what was its common relation to the lesser forms of trade. It is\r\nindeed conceivable that later research may show us that in many cases\r\nthe subjection of the crafts to the town—a subjection so astonishing\r\nin the silence, the calm, the rapidity with which it is affected—was\r\ncarried out by the indissoluble union of guild and corporation.\r\nOrganized in days when the way to wealth lay in the buying and selling\r\nof raw material, and in consequence by its constitution destitute of\r\npowers to follow the artizan into his workroom and meddle with his\r\ntools and the stuff of his trade, the Guild Merchant must very early\r\nhave seen its officers falling behind the officers of the town before\r\nwhom all bars and doors were thrown open; but if, suiting their policy\r\nto the necessities of the situation, seneschals and scavins of the\r\nGuild preserved their power by becoming bailiffs and councillors of\r\nthe borough, not by laying down their authority before the wardens of\r\nthe cobblers or the tailors, or even by taking them into its councils;\r\nsuch a guild might make its end neither by resigning to the crafts its\r\ncherished prerogatives nor by a spontaneous death, but by a consecrated\r\nalliance, in which it only seemed to merge its identity in the borough\r\ncorporation, while in reality it secured the preservation of its\r\nancient name and guaranteed the traditions and authority of its order.\r\nAs in Coventry, the force which had first served to overthrow the\r\nmastery of the lord of the soil might be employed later to enforce its\r\nown despotism over a subject people; and the question whether it used\r\nan old or a new name was a matter of little consequence to the inferior\r\nand dependent class. In either case the control of the town rested\r\nin the hands of an oligarchy of the richer sort of traders, who by\r\ncombination were able to exact from the mass of the working people an\r\nunlimited submission, and practically held at their mercy the fortunes\r\nof the free commons of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n The satisfactory working of the system may be inferred from its\r\n continued use in the next century. Plymouth may serve as an\r\n illustration. Among the three little fishing hamlets, the Augustinian\r\n Priors’ Sutton or South Town at the mouth of the Plym, and two King’s\r\n Suttons which had been granted out to noble families, the first\r\n stirrings of independent life seem to have begun about 1282, when the\r\n Sutton people, wanting to be free burgesses and to have their fair\r\n and market, begged for a piece of waste ground near the port, five\r\n perches long and one broad, and a piece of land “in the withdrawal of\r\n the sea” six acres big, where the King’s bailiff held his court in\r\n a certain house, and where every fishing boat coming to dry nets or\r\n sails paid toll to the King. They set up a stone cross and a stall\r\n for their market; in 1311 they made a final agreement with the Prior,\r\n and then or very soon after began yearly to elect a “Præpositus, or\r\n Custos Ville de Sutton Priors, which did then rule and govern under\r\n the King.” (In the time of Edward the Third he was called mayor;\r\n Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 274-5, 279, see also 297.) In 1411 the townsmen\r\n petition that they may yearly elect a mayor and be incorporated so as\r\n to be able to buy tenements without royal license (Gross, i. 94); but\r\n apparently it was not till 1440 that they really gained their wish by\r\n the efforts of a rich merchant of Bristol, Richard Trenode, who traded\r\n with Plymouth, and of his sister Thomasine, widow of a Plymouth\r\n citizen; who at great cost and labour won for the group of hamlets\r\n their final union into the free borough of Plymouth “with one Mayor\r\n and one perpetual Commonalty”; for which the town in gratitude bound\r\n itself in a sum of £200 to maintain a chaplain in the parish church of\r\n S. Andrew to pray daily for their souls.\r\n\r\n The important point is, however, that it was in this year, 1440,\r\n that the Plymouth Guild Merchant was either first established, or\r\n formally confirmed and given a definite position. (Gross, i. 15.) On\r\n one side a religious guild, on the other it was the governing body\r\n of the town, very jealous of its monopoly of power, as we see from\r\n the order of 1472, that every man made a freeman should be either a\r\n whole or a half-brother in Our Lady and S. George’s Guild, a whole\r\n brother paying 12_d._ yearly, and a half-brother 6_d._; and that if\r\n any of the commons was made one of the Twenty-four he must pay 8_d._\r\n yearly to the Guild, while if one of the Twenty-four was made one\r\n of the Twelve he must pay 1_s._ (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 272.) Like the\r\n Guild at Coventry of a century earlier the fraternity seems to have\r\n been at first an organization of the more enterprising inhabitants\r\n to secure the liberties promised by charter, to make a stand against\r\n any aggressions of the Earl of Devon, and to rid themselves of some\r\n of their obligations to the Prior, on the plea of a convenient\r\n poverty, and a subtle appeal to the new King Edward the Fourth to\r\n revise arrangements made by Henry the Sixth “late in deed and not of\r\n right King of England.” (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 272.) The ancient Guild\r\n of Totnes, known as the “Guild of the Commonalty” as late as 1333,\r\n survived in full power in 1449, when it was ordered that no one shall\r\n carry the mace before the mayor save a member of the Merchant Guild\r\n (Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 344-5).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN DEMOCRACY\r\n\r\n\r\nACCORDING to a theory which is commonly accepted the English borough\r\nin its first condition, and probably during a considerable part of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries, did actually realize the ideal of\r\na true democratic society; the spirit of popular liberty penetrated\r\nthe whole community, pervading the council and assembly of the town,\r\nthe leet court, the guild merchant, the companies of artizans; and\r\nunder the favouring influences of equality and fraternity government\r\nwas guided by common consent of the burgesses, by whom elections\r\nwere conducted and administration controlled. Elsewhere it is known\r\nthat the early communes, however strong their protest against the\r\ntyranny of alien despots, were within their own circle far from\r\ndemocratic in temper or practice; but it has been believed that in\r\nEngland, possibly by virtue of her people’s passionate instinct for\r\nliberty, town societies wore a more popular character and expressed\r\na loftier freedom. If this theory be exact, however, the reign of\r\nthe democracy was brief, and the later history of the towns from\r\nthe fourteenth century onwards is the tale of a swift decline from\r\nthe enjoyment of primitive liberty into impotent subjection to the\r\nrule of a narrow and selfish oligarchy, the usurpers of the people’s\r\nrights.[428] The hypothesis of a constant degradation of municipal\r\nliberty from the thirteenth to the sixteenth centuries becomes invested\r\nwith extraordinary interest, since all our judgments of the part that\r\nEngland has played in the history of free government must be coloured\r\nand determined by the ideas we accept as to the kind of civil freedom\r\nin which her people have really believed, the classes who have held\r\nto that faith, and the means by which they have pursued it. In the\r\nabsence of some strong compulsion, forcing men to yield obedience to\r\na “select” body, we question what outward influences or what inward\r\napathy could have led the boroughs, at the moment when wealth and\r\nprosperity crowned their vast activity, thus unanimously to betray the\r\nprivileges of their constitution and to deny their early faith; for in\r\nview of the whole drift of English history, and remembering how great a\r\npart the men of the towns played at this time in English life, it may\r\nwell seem inconceivable that the mental and political emancipation of\r\nthe sixteenth century should have been attained by a people who in the\r\nconduct of their own local affairs had already universally abandoned a\r\nnoble tradition of ancient rights and idly consented to the tyranny of\r\na mere plutocracy.\r\n\r\nTo find an example of the primitive form of municipal institutions,\r\nand how they were at the outset understood by the people, we naturally\r\nturn to the well-known story of Ipswich. On June 29, 1200, “the whole\r\ncommunity of the borough” elected the two bailiffs by whom it was to be\r\ngoverned, and four coroners, whose business it was to keep the pleas\r\nof the crown and see that the bailiffs treat rich and poor justly;\r\nand on the same day by common counsel of the town it was ordered that\r\nthere should be “twelve sworn capital portmen, just as there are in\r\nother boroughs in England, who are to have full power to govern and\r\nuphold the said borough with all its liberties, to render the judgments\r\nof the town, and to ordain and do all things necessary for the\r\nmaintenance of its honour.” From this moment “the community” as it were\r\nunclothed itself of power to lay it on the shoulders of the bailiffs\r\nand coroners, who thereupon proceeded to act with all the authority\r\nwith which they had been endued. They first appointed four approved\r\nand lawful men of each parish, who in their turn elected the twelve\r\nportmen. This being done, bailiffs, coroners, and portmen met—a little\r\ncompany of twelve, since bailiffs and coroners had all been appointed\r\ncapital portmen too—to make ordinances about the collection of customs\r\nand the police officers by whom their decrees were to be carried out.\r\nIn due time the whole community was called together to give their\r\nassent and consent to these ordinances; and they once more assembled\r\nto bestow a portion of their common land on the portmen in return for\r\ntheir labour in the common service, and to agree that all the laws and\r\nfree customs of the town should be entered in a doomsday roll to be\r\nkept by the bailiffs.[429]\r\n\r\nHere then we have the simplest form of early government—a council of\r\ntwelve “worthy and sufficient men” to assist the mayor or bailiffs in\r\nthe administration of the town, controlled by a _referendum_ to the\r\ngeneral body of burghers. The doors of the common house or the church\r\nwhere the councillors met stood open to all the freemen of the borough\r\nwho might attend to hear discussions, even in cases where they were\r\nnot allowed to join in them.[430] And in the original idea of the free\r\nborough every public act was legally supposed to require the whole\r\nconsent of the community from which theoretically at least all power\r\nwas ultimately derived; so that whether a new distribution of the\r\ncommon fields was made, or soldiers were called out and a settlement\r\nagreed upon as to their payment, or guns bought or hired for the common\r\nhouse or the church tower; whether an inquiry was ordained about the\r\n“livelihood” of the inhabitants and the taxes to be imposed on them,\r\nor a new law proposed, or new freemen admitted to the city liberties,\r\nor municipal officers elected, it was officially assumed that the\r\nunanimous assent of the whole people had been given in their common\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the common assembly are perhaps best defined in the\r\ncustoms of Hereford, drawn up in 1383, but which doubtless embody\r\ncustoms of older times. There we learn that at the great meetings held\r\nat Michaelmas and Easter, to which the whole people were gathered for\r\nview of frankpledge (in other words at the court leet), “the pleas of\r\nthe court being finished, the bailiff and steward, on the behalf of\r\nour lord the king and the commonalty, may command that all those which\r\nare not of the liberty should go out of the house and depart from the\r\ncourt; and then the bailiff and steward may take notice if there are\r\nany secrets or business which may concern the state of the city or\r\nthe citizens thereof, and let them proceed therein as they ought to\r\ndo.”[431] To these assemblies, according to the custom of Hereford,\r\nthe people ought to come, and if there was anyone “which will complain\r\nof any trespasses committed, or any other thing touching the state of\r\nthe city or themselves, they ought to speak the truth upon their own\r\nperil, not bringing with them any stranger ... because we do not use\r\nthat strangers shall come and implead amongst us and know the secrets\r\nof the court for divers dangers that thereby may ensue.”[432] In case\r\nof necessity the bailiff “by all kinds of rigour” might compel the\r\ndiscreeter citizens to come to the court and take their due part in its\r\nlabours; and in Sandwich we know that if the burgesses summoned by\r\nbell or horn failed to appear, the “rigour” of the mayor might go as\r\nfar as the sending of a serjeant to shut up all shops and work-rooms in\r\nthe town, and thus compel the burghers’ attention to public instead of\r\nprivate business.\r\n\r\nIn the general assembly there was always present the most conspicuous,\r\nif the most unwieldy, symbol of the authority of the people, and\r\nof the supreme power which was theirs, not only by law, but by an\r\nancient customary right which to the last remained independent of\r\nstatute or charter. It is true that the common gathering of the\r\npeople—without executive authority, without power to initiate laws,\r\ncalled together merely to give or refuse assent to the deeds of the\r\ngovernment—would in itself have given the democracy very little\r\nhold on the town magistrates in the exercise of their office. The\r\ntheory of the constitution, however, was that those who were mainly\r\ncharged with making and administering the laws should be yearly chosen\r\nfor their work by the people whom they were called to govern. The\r\nmayor who stood at the head of the administration was, according to\r\nthe common formula which pointed back to the fundamental right and\r\nfirst intention of the institution, elected “by assent and consent\r\nof the whole community of the town,” and “in the place from of old\r\naccustomed;”[433] and as each community was allowed to decide for\r\nitself how this “assent and consent” should be ascertained, there were\r\nperhaps towns where the practice followed the theory. Thus in Sandwich\r\nthe unanimous consent of the whole town was given by public vote in\r\na general assembly. On the first Monday in December at one o’clock of\r\nthe day, the town serjeant sounded the common horn, and made his cry\r\nat the fourteen accustomed places, “Every man of twelve years or more\r\ngo to St. Clement’s Church; there our commonalty hath need. Haste,\r\nhaste!”; and when the people had gathered in the church, having first\r\nordered the mayor to withdraw, they named him and three other natives\r\nof the town to be “put in election,” one of whom was then appointed by\r\nthe whole assembly voting after their degree, jurats first and freemen\r\nafterwards.[434]\r\n\r\nThis practice was no doubt rare, but the theory that the mayor was\r\nthe elected servant of the whole people, enshrined in the town book\r\nof customs, in ordinance and statute, never died out of the common\r\nspeech and belief of the people. “We must obey our chief bailiff as\r\none presenting the person of the king,” the burghers of Hereford\r\nsay deferentially, and proceed to make him swear on assuming office\r\n“that he shall do all things belonging to his office by the counsel\r\nof his faithful citizens”; and to order that if he refused to answer\r\ncomplaints he should be proceeded against as for perjury; that if\r\nhis accounts were not faithfully rendered all his goods should be\r\nseized; and that if “he shall be dishonest or proclaimed or suspected\r\nor convicted of any crime, he shall forthwith be put out of his\r\nplace.”[435] And as the mayor was the people’s servant, so in theory\r\nat least his election was supposed to be of their pure free-will. “From\r\nthis time forth,” say the inhabitants of Wycombe in 1505, “no burgess\r\nnor foreigner make no labour, nor desire no man to speak before the day\r\nof election of the mayor for no singular desire, but every man to show\r\ntheir voices at their own mind, without trouble or unreasonable doing\r\nthere in the time of their election.”[436]\r\n\r\nThe chosen head of the people was thus to the popular sentiment the\r\ntype and symbol of their freedom, and a Bristol chronicler tells us\r\nhow, the mayor being accused by an enemy of the king’s household, the\r\ntownspeople followed after him as he was led to prison, lamenting and\r\nweeping “as sons for their natural father.”[437] He was assisted by\r\ncouncillors also chosen to uphold the liberties of the borough; and the\r\nfrequent use of elected juries in public business served still further\r\nto maintain the ancient tradition of rights vested in the people. In\r\nthe manor courts of the country the jury made its way slowly and with\r\ndifficulty, but in the town courts it seems to have taken complete hold\r\nvery early, and to have been worked constantly and elaborately.[438]\r\nThe system was applied to all manner of local business. Not only did\r\nthe Leet jury in some towns, as in Nottingham and Andover, occupy\r\nitself with a vast range of affairs connected with government and\r\nlegislation; but it was a universal custom to appoint representatives\r\nof the community for any special purpose. Everywhere we have glimpses\r\nof bodies of jurors chosen to elect officers, to assess taxes, to make\r\nstatements as to a broken bridge, to hold discussions about tallages or\r\nabout disputed boundaries[439]—transient apparitions supposed, when\r\ntheir work is done, to dissolve into their constituent householders,\r\nand which appear and vanish again as the centuries pass, till the\r\nburghers, recognizing in them an admirable machinery for larger uses,\r\nfix or seek to fix them into permanent existence as town councils. To a\r\npeople inheriting the high and inalienable prerogatives of a chartered\r\nborough, with the right of free meeting and free speech in their\r\ngeneral assembly, presided over by a “natural father” of their own\r\nchoosing, the jury system might seem to afford the final safeguard of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nSuch was the ideal of a self-governing community in early times—an\r\nideal to which in later ages men looked back wistfully, as summing up\r\nthe faith and practice of a golden age. Whenever the mayor was summoned\r\nto take his oath to the people on “the Black Book” of the city,\r\ninstead of the Gospels;[440] whenever according to custom the ancient\r\nordinances of the town were yearly read before the people gathered\r\ntogether, the ideal of a noble liberty was proclaimed anew. The boast\r\nthat the borough’s rights were founded and grounded upon franchises,\r\nliberties, and free ancient customs, and not upon common law,[441]\r\nremained a living faith; and a tradition of independence sanctioned and\r\nenjoined by authority was handed down from generation to generation, by\r\nmen who believed themselves born into a birthright of freedom for which\r\nthey need plead neither the law of nature nor the law of Rome,[442]\r\nsince it was the honest handicraft of English kings and English\r\nlawyers, and paid for in hard cash out of their own grandfathers’\r\npockets.\r\n\r\nBut behind law and charter there lay always the great appeal to\r\nimmemorial custom. In that dim time of which no memory is, a power\r\nyet more venerable and imposing than law itself had been the keeper\r\nof popular liberties; and to the last we may perhaps trace the\r\nobscure record of a double origin of rights in the two words by\r\nwhich the borough expressed its corporate existence—the “Citizens”\r\nor “Burgesses,” and the “Commonalty” or “Community.” By the common\r\nexplanation of these terms they are supposed originally to have borne\r\nexactly the same meaning, and alike served to express the general body\r\nof freemen in the borough; but presently to have diverged in sense as\r\nthe more important “citizens” gradually absorbed the management of\r\npublic business, and appropriated to themselves the name of honour,\r\nwhile the lower classes were massed together as “the communitas,” so\r\nthat this word at last came to be little more than a contemptuous\r\nnick-name given to the mob in the later days of oligarchic rule. In\r\nthe town records, however, we find these two words used from first to\r\nlast in a precise and formal manner which is most characteristic of the\r\nMiddle Ages; each one having its own character and meaning, and neither\r\nof them invading the place of the other. As far back as the thirteenth\r\ncentury “the Burgesses” already appear as distinct from the commons at\r\nlarge, and use their title with an official and technical significance\r\nattached to the phraze which gives it a special value.[443] The use\r\nof the word in charters and deeds seems then to denote the corporate\r\nbody of citizens who had been legally endowed with certain privileges,\r\nwhose association had been created by charter and was dissolved if the\r\nborough lost its franchise; and who in a vast mass of business, and\r\nespecially in relations of the borough to the crown, were represented\r\nby the official body of the town which acted in their name, and\r\nespecially assumed the title of “the Burgesses.”\r\n\r\nBut behind this corporate body lies the “communitas”—a term which has\r\na far earlier origin and a far deeper meaning. Whatever may be the base\r\nuse of the word which has crept into chronicles and common talk, in\r\nmunicipal deeds and ordinances it is a name of dignity and honour—an\r\nancient title of nobility. It carries the mind far back to the\r\nprimitive society of householders in the ville, bound by mutual ties\r\nand protected by customary rights, which had preceded the free borough,\r\nand by its discipline had created the advanced type of commonwealth\r\nwhich is discovered to us in Ipswich at the inauguration of its new\r\ncareer as a chartered town. We feel the story of new beginnings such\r\nas this to be the consummation of a long history; and even under the\r\ncorporate life of the citizens recognized by law we may sometimes\r\ndetect the persistent survival of the ancient community, which still\r\nemerges in the half light with its consecrated title, and the remnants\r\nof its old functions ever clinging to its shadowy form. For it seems\r\nthat in municipal records the “community” or “commune” possibly appears\r\nas something which existed before the corporation in time,[444]\r\nwhich might have its common seal separate from the mayor’s seal,[445]\r\nwhich held property and exercised certain powers, and independent as\r\nit was of all charters, survived all loss of franchises conferred by\r\nroyal grant alone. We seem to find it asserting its existence when the\r\nborough had been dismembered, and there was no longer any place for\r\n“the citizens.” It sends its appeals to the King over the heads of the\r\nofficial caste; when an intermunicipal treaty has to be drawn up the\r\n“communitas” usually appears as the contracting body, whose members\r\nare bound together in mutual responsibility; it claimed to hold common\r\nproperty of the borough under its own name and apparently by some other\r\ntitle than the burgesses; and by its very existence it maintained to\r\nthe last the tradition of an ancient free community reaching back to\r\na time of which no memory was, and endowed with prerogatives on which\r\nneither mayor nor council dared to lay their hands.\r\n\r\nThe privileges of the early community were no doubt quickly merged in\r\nthe more liberal rights which were made sure to the borough by its\r\ncharter; but there was one department, the management of their common\r\nlands, in which the existence of a separate power seems to exhibit\r\nitself beyond all doubt.[446] Never did the commonalty abandon their\r\nright of control over the public estate. The division of strips of\r\narable ground, the apportionment of pastures and closes, the letting\r\nof stalls or fields, the gathering in of rents for burgages or common\r\nproperty let on lease, these were things done by the act and in\r\nthe name of the whole community, without any mention of “council”\r\nor “citizens”; and in one borough after another any tampering with\r\nthe public estate by the governing class drove the whole body of\r\ninhabitants into the streets threatening revolution. In their claim to\r\n“have knowledge from year to year how the common ground is occupied\r\nand by whom, and if that it be not rented the commons to seize it\r\ninto their hands, to that end that they may be remembered of their\r\nright, and to have profit and avail thereof” ... and “to know verily\r\nwhat their rent cometh to,”[447] the freemen of the fifteenth century\r\ncarried on a tradition known in the boroughs two hundred years before,\r\nand in many instances their tenacious grip on the town lands was\r\nevidently one of the most important factors in the shaping of town\r\npolitics.[448]\r\n\r\nFrom the very beginning of municipal records, therefore, we find the\r\ntown living as it were a double life—the one buttressed on either\r\nside by law and charter—the other sending roots deep down into the\r\npast, and drawing from primitive custom and tradition a sustenance\r\nwhich “Westminster law”[449] could neither give nor take away; the one\r\nregularly expressed in the stately proceedings of “the Citizens”—the\r\nother finding a fitful and incoherent, but no less distinctive\r\nutterance in the doings of “the commonalty;” and the two, intimately\r\nallied and constantly hostile, persisting side by side through\r\ncenturies of strained but honourable union. With these immemorial\r\ntraditions of franchises, liberties, and free ancient customs, it\r\nfollowed that when burghers set up any plea for liberties old or new\r\nthey imported no revolutionary note into their demands. It is hard\r\nto tell from what source they drew their faith in a freedom which\r\nthey confessed to have been lost, which indeed neither they nor their\r\nfathers had known; but it seems that the conviction never failed of an\r\nancient type and pattern of liberty which had been proved once for all\r\nby remote ancestors of the heroic age. Townsmen professed to claim\r\nnothing more than such privileges as were “according to our Red Book\r\nas we do think”; or that had been bestowed by a charter of the House\r\nof Alfred which had once compassed them about with liberty, though it\r\nwas now, alas, _casualiter amissa_; or that dated back to the time when\r\nthe grace of the Lady Godiva had broken the bonds of slavery. Just\r\nas Englishmen under the rule of the foreign kings looked back with\r\ndesire to the good laws of the Confessor, so the burghers had their\r\nfiction, too, of the joy of their first estate as by law established,\r\nand turned over the rolls of their treasure chest and bought copies of\r\nMagna Charta, to discover anew the light of privilege that had once\r\nirradiated the whole commonalty. We have seen in the case of Exeter\r\nhow this essential faith of the people survived, as it had preceded,\r\ntheir study of historical documents. As the spirit of independence and\r\ndiscussion awoke, the conflict that was presently to be waged in the\r\ndomain of religion was oddly foreshadowed in the realm of municipal\r\npolitics; when the common folk demanded that they should be allowed to\r\nreturn to the written law in its primitive and unadulterated purity;\r\nwhile the guardians of established order, aldermen and councillors\r\nand great people of “the clothing,”—resting on the theory of a\r\nliving tradition and its secular “developement,”—appealed with no\r\nless confidence and insistence to the majesty of law as it appeared\r\nwhen interpreted by the custom of generations and expounded by the\r\nscarlet-robed officials who surrounded the mayor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n Mr. Maitland (Law Quarterly, January, 1893) gives a most interesting\r\n account of the customs of holding and dividing lands in various\r\n boroughs. On the whole he doubts whether the holding of land by\r\n burgesses subject to communal regulations is generally a very ancient\r\n arrangement. There seems, however, to be evidence for the antiquity\r\n of the holding of common property by the community; and it may be\r\n possible further to discover the existence of a permanent distinction\r\n between the property thus held by the community for the common use,\r\n and that held by the corporation for certain special purposes, such as\r\n payment of ferm, taxes, public servants, and the like—a distinction\r\n which rests on the different function which I have suggested in the\r\n case of those bodies.\r\n\r\n The community of Ipswich apparently possessed land before 1200.\r\n (Gross, ii. 122, cap. xviii. 115.) For its common lands see also\r\n Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 234-7, 246. Lands were held by Wycombe (Ibid. v.\r\n 556-7). In Morpeth the “burgesses and community” make grants of land\r\n in the thirteenth century. (Ibid. vi. 527.) Andover in 1314 owned land\r\n managed by the community. (Gross, ii. 307, 326, 330.) Oxford (Boase,\r\n 47) and Chester might also be cited. Also Hythe (Hist. MSS. Com. iv.\r\n i. 432, 433), and Worcester (English Guilds, 386) and Preston (Preston\r\n Guild Records, xxiv.). The Nottingham Records mention the “land of the\r\n community” (ii. 269. See also 304-6). A grant of six acres of mosses\r\n was given to Liverpool in 1309 (Picton’s Municipal Records, i. 8, 12.\r\n For the results of holding this property see 11). Birmingham held land\r\n and rights of common (Survey of the Borough and Manor, xiv. 74, 102).\r\n\r\n Romney held the Salt Marsh, the Gorse, the Horseho, and the Harpe\r\n pastures, the old bed of the Rother, the forelands and saltpits and\r\n warrens and gardens and marshlands, “the land of the commonalty”\r\n (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 536, 537, 539, 540-3).\r\n\r\n Lydd (Ibid. v. 525, 531-2) seems to have held marshland common on the\r\n Ripe for at least four hundred sheep, and the boroughs of Dengemarsh\r\n and Orwellstow. Its ownership of the shore as against the claims of\r\n the crown was proved in the time of Elizabeth by evidence from “the\r\n face and vieu of the antienty of the town and church, and buryall\r\n of men cross-legged and such like monuments.” A seal given to the\r\n community by the archbishop at the beginning of their incorporation\r\n “long before the Conquest,” as rumour said, was used (as distinguished\r\n from the bailiff’s seal) as late as Elizabeth’s time for the selling\r\n or letting of lands by the town. (Ibid. v. 530-2.) The cases of Lydd\r\n and Morpeth illustrate the way in which the lord of a borough granted\r\n it the possession of land along with grants of local government and\r\n independence.\r\n\r\n Colchester had 500 acres of Lammas lands besides Mile End Heath, etc.\r\n (Cutts’ Colchester, 142-4); and meadow still divided by boundary\r\n stones into strips. (Ibid. 67-8. See also for 1322 p. 142.)\r\n\r\n Coventry owned common lands in the fourteenth century, of which there\r\n is no suggestion that they were newly acquired, and which belonged to\r\n the community and not to the corporation, and were distinct from lands\r\n or property acquired under the statute of mortmain and used for the\r\n payment of town officers, etc.\r\n\r\n There were boroughs whose disputes about their property dated from the\r\n very beginning of their corporate existence. Southampton was already\r\n quarrelling about its common in the thirteenth century; and the\r\n Norwich citizens were engaged in a lawsuit in 1205 as to their rights\r\n of pasture on land for which rent was due to the Prior, but which the\r\n Prior could not legally either enclose or cultivate without a grant\r\n from the city. (Norwich Town Close Evidences, 4, 5. For the common\r\n lands see ibid. pp. 52-64.)\r\n\r\n In some instances the burghers apparently did not profess to own the\r\n soil but only to hold an exclusive right to its use; and the furious\r\n excitement of the Norwich citizens (see p. 392) about a tribute of\r\n 4_s._ yearly to the Prior for a certain meadow proves how very thin\r\n the boundary line between possession and use might become.\r\n\r\n The main evidence as to the possession of lands lies in the town\r\n archives and not in public records. It is a question for lawyers why\r\n disputes concerning them apparently were not brought before the judges\r\n of the King’s Bench, but seem to have been settled at home by fighting\r\n or by arbitration. Possibly because the “communitas” had no power to\r\n sue in the law courts as a legal person. In any case it must have had\r\n all kinds of dangers to fear—the danger of having local customary law\r\n overridden by Westminster law, the danger of advertising the amount\r\n of their possessions, and a danger which is constantly present in\r\n town records, of encroachments under one pretence or another by the\r\n corporation or members of it, and the fear of which, in days when\r\n “the law is ended as a man is friended,” would give reason enough for\r\n keeping out of the courts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN OLIGARCHY\r\n\r\n\r\nIT is evident that if the towns had been called on for a confession of\r\nfaith, the declaration of a pure and unadulterated freedom would have\r\nbeen in every mouth. There remains the question of how far it was found\r\npossible to carry that faith into the common practice of daily life.\r\n\r\nWe have seen how freedom was enthroned at Ipswich before the whole\r\ncommunity of townsmen, who with outstretched hands and loud unanimous\r\nvoice swore before heaven to maintain the liberties of the new\r\nrepublic. If, however, we glance again at Ipswich when it next\r\ncomes clearly into view, a century after it had obtained its grant\r\nof privileges, there is very little trace of a golden age save for\r\npublicans and portmen. For in 1321 we find a narrow official class\r\nin the noontide of their power. Since there was no fixed day for\r\nelections they had been used by “lordly usurpation and private covin”\r\nto make bailiffs at their own pleasure secretly without consent of\r\nthe people; they grievously taxed and amerced the commons for their\r\nown private purposes; they used the common seal without the common\r\nconsent to the great burden and damage of the commonalty; and made new\r\nburgesses at their own pleasure without the public knowledge, so as to\r\ndivide the entrance money among themselves; and by a regular system of\r\nforestalling and secret sale, merchants and inn-keepers had combined\r\nto rob the commons of their right to free and equal trade.[450]\r\nAgainst these abuses the burgesses sought to repeat and reinforce\r\nthe ordinances of the town, but it may well be doubted whether the\r\ncustomary defiance of the laws of 1200 was likely to be corrected by\r\nthe mere re-enactment or amendment of rules in the book of ordinances.\r\n\r\nFor it was not in Ipswich alone that the commonalty were held at the\r\nmercy of a handful of men in power, without hope of redress through\r\ntheir assemblies or constitutional methods at home. In 1304 justices\r\nwere sent down from Westminster to inquire into a complaint of “the\r\npoor men of our city of Norwich,” where, according to the petition of\r\nthe commons, the rich, in defiance of all laws against forestalling,\r\nbought up victuals and goods before they came into the market, and\r\ndaily inflicted other grievances on the said poor men “to the manifest\r\ndeterioration of the city.”[451] And again in 1307, “les menes gentz de\r\nla communaute de la ville de Norweiz” appeal to the king on the ground\r\nthat an inquiry by justices had been promised them concerning the fines\r\nand tallages which weighed them down; the poor people, they said,\r\nhad been unjustly taxed by the bailiffs and the rich (“les riches”),\r\n“but on the hearing, the bailiffs and the rich spoke so fair to the\r\nsaid poor people, promising them redress and that they should have no\r\ncause to complain in future, and that no tallage should be levied from\r\nthem without their common assent, that the poor men ceased from their\r\nsuit. But now the said bailiffs and rich have levied two hundred marks\r\nwithout warrant and threaten to levy a still higher tallage.”[452] The\r\nlaw of the matter was clear enough, for only a year or two before the\r\nprinciple that the bailiffs could only assess taxes “by the assent\r\nof the whole of the commonalty or of the greater part of the same”\r\nhad been re-affirmed;[453] and the king accordingly sent answer, “If\r\ntallage have been made without assent of the commonalty, let them have\r\na writ against those who have imposed such tallage to answer before the\r\nking, and that henceforth it be not done.”\r\n\r\nIt is, however, hard to say what amount of relief to the mean folk\r\nwas actually given by such an order from high quarters. At the very\r\nsame time, in 1304, the people of the neighbouring borough of Lynn\r\nwere seeking protection against the ruling burgesses, and charged\r\nthem with the usual trespasses—with assessing tallages without the\r\nunanimous consent of the community; levying these tallages and other\r\ngreat sums of money from the poor and but moderately endowed men of\r\nthe community; employing the sums thus raised for their own use and\r\nnot for the advantage of the community or the reparation of the town;\r\nforestalling goods on the way to market; and establishing and using\r\ncorruptions contrary both to common and to merchant law. The great\r\npeople of Lynn, however, easily put themselves beyond all fear of\r\njustice by simply buying from the king in 1305[454] letters of pardon\r\nand release for the crimes of which they were accused—letters which\r\nevidently left them free to go on in the same course. Upon which the\r\npeople instinctively turned to their natural ally, the lord of the\r\nmanor himself, and through the powerful aid of the Bishop, and his aid\r\nonly, were able to win from the mayor in 1309 the composition which\r\nbecame the charter of their liberties, according to which all the\r\n“unreasonable grievous” tasks and tallages laid by “the great men of\r\nthe town upon the mean people and the poor”—or as the Latin version\r\nhas it by the potentiores on the mediocres and inferiores—and their\r\n“grievous distressing so violently of them,” were to come to an end,\r\nand taxes were henceforth to be assessed in due measure according to\r\nthe three degrees of prosperity.[455]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that we need not wait for the fifteenth century to\r\ndiscover an oligarchical system of administration which was in its\r\nfull strength in the English boroughs as early as 1300, and can even\r\nbe traced back at least fifty years earlier. In the middle of the\r\nthirteenth century the commons of Lincoln, having a dispute with the\r\nlord of S. Botolph’s fair about tolls, formally withdrew altogether\r\nfrom the fair till they should obtain a remedy from the king; but two\r\nsons of the mayor and two other burghers, rich traders who did not\r\nwant their business interrupted, and who were evidently town officials\r\nwith command of the common seal, gave the lord a charter promising a\r\nyearly rent of £10 from the Lincoln citizens, and this “without any\r\nassent or consent of the commonalty.” It was in vain that the people\r\nmade remonstrance; the charter was still binding in 1276,[456] and in\r\n1325 the inhabitants of Lincoln were still without defence against the\r\n“great lords of the said city” who formed the corporation. While “les\r\ngrauntz Seigneurs” themselves paid nothing, the “mean people” were\r\narbitrarily taxed without their own consent; they alone were forced to\r\nkeep the nightly watch; they paid their murage tax for the building\r\nof the wall, and the rulers used the money for their own purposes\r\nand rendered no accounts to the people;[457] and the pitiful appeal\r\nof the commonalty to the king praying him to provide some remedy for\r\ntheir grievances only proved how helpless they were to influence the\r\ngoverning body which was supposed to rule solely by their consent. In\r\nlike manner the mayor and other officers of Oxford were charged in\r\n1294 with exacting tallages without the king’s order or the town’s\r\nconsent, applying the town revenues to their own uses, raising loans\r\nwithout proper receipts, and collecting money for expenses of the\r\nrich on juries and assizes while the poor were left to pay their own\r\ncosts.[458] Probably the richer party secured the jury, for the verdict\r\nwas given against the burgher who had instituted the suit; but his\r\ncomplaint is so absolutely similar to those raised in other towns at\r\nthe same time that we can scarcely doubt its truth.[459]\r\n\r\nThe inner contentions of Bristol[460] and of Andover[461] in the early\r\nyears of the fourteenth century repeat in varying forms the same story\r\nof a few rich burghers managing the whole machinery of administration,\r\nand of a commonalty whose voice was often scarcely heard in elections,\r\nwho were unable to secure the just assessment of taxes, or to prevent\r\nthe money from being devoted to improper uses, and who daily saw the\r\nlaws of trade—the assize of bread or beer, the injunctions against\r\nforestalling and regrating and a thousand tricks of commerce—diverted\r\nto the convenience of the rich officials, while the common folk\r\npatiently expiated their sins before the judgment seat of the great\r\noffenders who sat in careless immunity on their high places.\r\n\r\nIt is manifestly hard to find in the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies the happy age of the historian’s dream, when “there was a\r\nwarmer relation between high and low, when each class thought more\r\nof its duties than its interests, and religion, which was the same\r\nto all, was really believed in. Under such conditions,” we are told,\r\n“inequality was natural and wholesome;” and apparently an age of\r\ninnocence and peace attested the fostering care of a universal faith;\r\nfor according to this theory, so highly commended and so widely\r\nbelieved, it was only “when religion became opinion, dubious more or\r\nless and divorced from conduct, while pleasures became more various\r\nand more attainable, the favoured classes fell away from the intention\r\nof their institution, monopolized the sweets of life and left the\r\nbitter to the poor.”[462] Whatever “the intention of their institution”\r\nmay have been, however, there is not a particle of proof that the\r\nintention of the favoured classes themselves did at this time differ\r\nsensibly from that which prevailed at the Reformation; nor were the\r\ndominant folk of town or country disposed voluntarily to nail their\r\ninterests on the cross of duty—whether we consider the knight “hunting\r\nhardily” hares and foxes,[463] and wholly regardless of his oath to\r\nthe labourer “to keep him and his chattel as covenant was between\r\nthem;”[464] or the lord with his loud laugh calling for his rent;[465]\r\nor the trader filling his pockets in “deceit of the poor commons,” the\r\nalderman adding field to field, the cook and brewer building their\r\nburgages out of the pence of the poor. The relations of inequality, in\r\nthe exceedingly bitter form in which they were then known, may have\r\nseemed natural, or perhaps supernatural, to an age when all life,\r\nsocial, economic, and political, was brought under the universal sway\r\nof dogma and superstition; but it is certain that they were not held\r\nto be wholesome by those who suffered, and whose struggles to win the\r\nfreedom so long promised to them in ordinance and charter fill the town\r\nrecords of succeeding centuries.\r\n\r\nFor in these young republics formidable difficulties lay in the way of\r\nsecuring any popular control whatever over administration. In the first\r\nplace the general assembly, which was to be the pledge of the people’s\r\nliberties, and to assure to them the final word about the taxes they\r\nhad to pay and the manner in which they were to be governed, proved\r\nin its actual working but a poor security for freedom. It would seem\r\nsometimes that in the hurry and excitement of expanding trade, men busy\r\nin their shops had as little time or attention to bestow on serious\r\npolitics as American citizens of a later date; or perhaps the very\r\nopposite accident might befall the borough, and a heterogeneous and\r\nunmanageable mob gathered at the place of assembly, where strangers\r\nand unenfranchised journeymen pushed their way in among the lawful\r\ncitizens. But a tumultuous gathering of ignorant and over-tasked\r\nartizans and poor householders crowding from the narrow lanes of the\r\nborough must manifestly have been a very rare and occasional expedient,\r\nand at the best meant an assembly incapable of real business. In\r\ngeneral it would seem that any small number of burgesses who happened\r\nto be present at a meeting in the common hall or at the court leet,\r\nor a select group of the better class specially summoned by the\r\nmayor,[466] were taken to represent the general body of inhabitants,\r\nand their consent was legally counted as conveying the assent of the\r\nburghers at large. From the very first, and under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances, it is evident that the assembly gave no real security to\r\nthe commonalty, that through its gatherings they could never hope to\r\nbring sustained or efficient pressure to bear on the governing class,\r\nand that “the entire assent and consent of the whole community” was for\r\nthe most part simply taken for granted. If the theory of government by\r\nthe people for the people already existed in law books and ordinances\r\nthe means of realizing such an ideal had yet to be found.\r\n\r\nNor must it be forgotten that from the very first no man of the people\r\ncould hope to aspire to any post in the administration of the town. All\r\nimportant public offices were confined to persons of a certain station,\r\nand “the rank of a mayor” or “the rank of a sheriff” were well-known\r\nmediæval phrases which expressed a comfortable social position\r\nmaintained by an adequate income. Councillors and chief officers were\r\nchosen from the class of “magnates”[467]—men not bound by the law of\r\nfrankpledge and possibly holding a position of some authority—of whom\r\nthere are traces in Norwich and possibly in other cities; or from the\r\n“good and sufficient” men of the borough; or from the class who were\r\ntechnically known as the “probi homines,” the “good” or “credible” or\r\n“lawful men” privileged to serve as legal assessors in the civic courts\r\nand “credible witnesses” to bargains, and who had probably come to be\r\nregarded as an official class and gradually organized into a separate\r\ncaste.[468] This choice of wealthy officials ultimately depended of\r\ncourse on the custom of those days by which the chief officers and\r\nthe townsfolk were held mutually responsible for defaults; so that in\r\nthe interests of the people themselves, as well as of the king, it\r\nwas important to secure men of substance whose possessions formed a\r\nguarantee to both parties—a guarantee which was by no means originally\r\na figure of speech, as we see from the case of the Lincoln bailiffs in\r\n1276, when the receipts for paying the ferm were diminished, “wherefore\r\nthey who have once been bailiffs of Lincoln can scarcely rise from\r\npoverty and misery.”[469] The opulent class who bore the chief burden\r\nof responsibility shared the compensating pleasures of power. We have\r\nseen the primitive simplicity with which at Ipswich twelve portmen\r\ndivided among themselves all the posts of bailiffs, coroners, and\r\ncouncillors; and in fact among the handful of “worthy” men which could\r\nbe produced in modest little market-towns,[470] whose clustered\r\ndwellings of wood and plaster, bordering narrow alleys that ran to\r\nthe central market-place, lay almost hidden in fields and gardens,\r\nthe burghers had actually no great choice of rulers. From generation\r\nto generation the chief municipal offices were handed down in the few\r\nleading families of the place. A great merchant would take the command\r\nagain and again while the whole town lay at his discretion, for though\r\na universal law forbade the continuous holding of office and usually\r\nfixed an interval of two or more years before re-election, either the\r\nlaw was persistently ignored, or as soon as the period of retirement\r\nhad elapsed, power inevitably fell back to its former possessor.[471]\r\nHow greatly this state of things was determined by economic conditions\r\nwe may see from the fact that in a place like Nottingham, where wealth\r\nwas widely distributed, it does not seem that any single family rose\r\nto very marked supremacy;[472] and in general a comparison of lists of\r\ntown officers indicates that as the growth of trade in the fifteenth\r\ncentury increased the numbers of well-to-do burghers and merchants,\r\nthere was a corresponding variety in the names of men entrusted with\r\noffice. At the best however the upper class was but a little one,\r\nand usually the corporation with its one or two councils composed of\r\ntwelve and twenty-four members, or even of twenty-four and forty-eight,\r\nas well as the retired magnates who constituted “the clothing,” and\r\na whole army of officials of various kinds, recorder, town clerk,\r\nchamberlains or treasurers, aldermen, decennaries of the market,\r\nbailiffs, coroners, arbitrators, jurors, and the like, must have\r\nabsorbed a very considerable proportion of the well-to-do inhabitants.\r\nA close caste was easily developed out of the compact body of merchants\r\nand thriving traders who formed the undisputed aristocracy of the town,\r\nand whose social pre-eminence doubtless went far to establish their\r\npolitical dominion.\r\n\r\nAnd if very little space was practically found in mediæval times for\r\ndemocratic theories of government, whether in the conception of a\r\ngoverning class, or in the working of the general assembly, still less\r\nare they to be found in the prevailing views as to representation. In\r\nthe case of Ipswich we have seen how rapidly the great body of the\r\ntownspeople retire from the scene when they have fulfilled their first\r\nsimple function of electing bailiffs and coroners. It is the bailiffs\r\nand coroners who nominate the committee to elect the portmen,[473]\r\nand then the twelve between them take charge in a general way of the\r\nborough and its affairs, while the commons go back to attend to their\r\nown business and are henceforth only from time to time summoned for\r\na general assembly, where they gather like a Greek chorus to view\r\nwith official eyes the progress of the drama, and to applaud in due\r\nform the action of the ultimate executive or express an expected\r\nand resigned acquiescence with all their will. People talked, it is\r\ntrue, of election by the whole community, and this was the theory of\r\nordinance and charter, but the universal fashion of the day in all\r\nranks and classes was to adopt some more or less complicated system of\r\nindirect election which, whether intentionally or not, was admirably\r\nsuited to the use and convenience of the minority. The nobles who under\r\nthe provisions of Oxford formed the council of Fifteen to assist Henry\r\nthe Third used exactly the same devices as were of common experience\r\namong merchants and artizans and burghers; for not only in trading\r\nor in social-religious guilds were the members accustomed to choose\r\ntheir governor through a select committee of four, five, seven, eight,\r\nor twelve men; but in the boroughs themselves the plans by which the\r\nsovereign people delegated their power to a few “worthy and sufficient”\r\ncitizens were so ingenious and elaborate that we may well doubt whether\r\nthe majority had ever any chance at all of making their will prevail.\r\nIn some cases indeed the leading people of the town were altogether\r\nindependent of popular election, and hereditary owners of the wards sat\r\nin the high places of the hall in virtue of their landed property,[474]\r\nnot of the people’s will; while in others a guild merchant apparently\r\nimposed its own council on the community at large.[475]\r\n\r\nNor can we wonder at anxiety to secure an efficient governing class if\r\nwe consider for a moment the work that lay before the council. From\r\nthe affairs of a pig-market and the letting of butchers’ stalls they\r\nwere required to pass to business of the most complicated kind—to\r\nconstitute a Board of Trade concerned with inland and foreign commerce;\r\na Foreign Office constantly busied with the external relations of\r\nthe town, whether to overlord, or king, or rival boroughs; a legal\r\ncommittee responsible for all the complicated law business that might\r\narise out of any one of these relations, or out of the defence of the\r\nchartered privileges of the borough; a Treasury Board whose incomings\r\nwere drawn in infinitesimal proportions from the most varied and\r\nprecarious sources, and whose outgoings included every possible payment\r\nwith which any public body has ever had to deal. The king might call\r\non them for the supervision of the staple trade, the management of\r\nriver basins, the draining of marshes, the collection of taxes, the\r\nadministration of justice, the local carrying out of laws framed by\r\nParliament, the guarding of the coast, the provisioning and training of\r\ndetachments of the national army. The responsibility thrown on them by\r\nthe central government was constantly increased as time went on; and\r\nthere was probably nothing which proved so important in tightening the\r\nhold of the oligarchy on government as the appointment of a certain\r\nnumber of the upper council to be justices of the peace, having a\r\nformidable authority over the working classes, besides the power to\r\ndraw into their own hands a mass of business which had once gone to the\r\ncourt leet of the burghers.\r\n\r\nNo doubt the official caste from the beginning sufficiently appreciated\r\nthe pleasures of power not to deprecate their increase; but apart\r\nfrom any question of greedy usurpation, it was inevitable under such\r\nconditions that a strong government should have been formed of experts\r\nwho need not necessarily be changed every year or elected by a popular\r\nvote. The date at which some custom of this kind became established\r\nis probably much earlier than is commonly supposed; and there is\r\nevidence to shew that it often preceded by a long time the charters\r\nwhich make it legally binding. Possibly indeed the administrative\r\ndespotism of a narrow oligarchy was often as old as the independence\r\nof the borough itself. The need for capable rulers may have been even\r\ngreater at the perilous outset of its life than in its later times\r\nof confident strength; and when we remember the imperfection of the\r\nprimitive machinery for ascertaining the popular will, the weakness of\r\nthe general assembly, and the limitations put on public election, it\r\nis evident that the theory of a free and equal people electing their\r\nown government by the unanimous consent of the whole community, and\r\ncontrolling administration by a constant criticism, was a theory which\r\ncould never have been practically carried into effect; which as a\r\nmatter of fact the governing class had no wish to encourage, and which\r\nthe mass of the governed had neither the cohesion nor the intelligence\r\nto enforce.\r\n\r\nOnce in authority it must be admitted that the ruling class carried\r\nthemselves bravely, shirking neither responsibility nor power. In\r\ntheir splendid robes of office, with furs and stripes and rich colours\r\nchanged at every great occasion to make a more imposing show, the\r\nmunicipal officers were the dazzling centre of every procession and\r\npublic function in the town—at Advent services, at the bull-baiting\r\nand public games,[476] at the pageant of Corpus Christi, or the yearly\r\nsolemnity of recounting to the people the ordinances and liberties of\r\nthe borough. Strict discipline, unquestioned authority, a belief in\r\nfirm government, were prominent in their administration. Of the general\r\nbody of burgesses and craft guilds implicit obedience was required,\r\nand the corporation allowed neither discussion nor interference with\r\nits decrees. Windows through which inquisitive townsmen peeped into\r\nthe chamber where they consulted were blocked up; listeners under the\r\neaves “to hear the words of the council” were violently discouraged;\r\nsevere rules forbade the meddling of too active citizens, and fines\r\nand imprisonment fell on those who “in an abusive manner” called a\r\ncouncillor a “Fliperarde,”[477] or who wickedly “wished that all the\r\njurats had been burnt in the common ship,” or with “opprobrious and\r\ncrooked words” declared that they were “false thieves,” or that they\r\n“were looked upon at Dover as so many grooms.”[478] Administrative\r\ncapacity went hand in hand with the self-assertion and exclusive\r\ntemper of a successful class. To the townspeople, amid the confusion\r\nof national revolutions and civil war, the mayor remained a standing\r\nwitness to the enduring forces of an order triumphant over discord and\r\nconfusion; as in Exeter, where between 1477 and 1497 the citizens had\r\nseen a skilfully organized revolt shattered before the municipal power,\r\nand a victorious mayor holding office undisturbed under four successive\r\nkings, three of whom had come to the crown by the violent death or\r\ndeposition of their predecessors.[479]\r\n\r\nThere is perhaps no better type of the superior town official than\r\nthe Common Clerk, in his dress of sanguine cloth striped with violet\r\nrays, or of more sober green bordered with fur.[480] The business of\r\nhis office came into great consideration with the growth of local\r\nliberties. In the fifteenth century there was scarcely a single town\r\nwhich did not require to have its “Custumal” written out afresh from\r\nthe faded and worn-out copies made in earlier centuries,[481] while in\r\na vast number of cases, where the old French or Latin was no longer\r\nunderstood by the townsfolk, the writer had not only to decipher and\r\ncopy the old tattered roll, but to translate it.[482] Perhaps portions\r\nof the gospels were needed—“enough to swear by.”[483] Every town\r\nalso instituted the making of its own “Domesday Book,” its black book\r\nor white book or red book as the case might be, with copies of all\r\ndeeds, wills, and charters relating to municipal affairs;[484] and\r\nwhenever a legal question arose or local liberties were imperilled new\r\nsearch was made in the chest containing the town “evidences” on which\r\nthe municipal privileges depended, and copies were written out of\r\nActs of Parliament,[485] extracts from Domesday, Magna Charta,[486]\r\nor legal documents such as the New Tenures by Lyttleton.[487] The\r\nclerk must be able to translate and to read in the mother tongue\r\nto the community any letters or orders sent from Westminster. He\r\nhad to expound legal technicalities to the council, and to use them\r\neffectively in the town’s interest, not only at Westminster, but in\r\nthe innumerable disputes that arose between borough and borough as to\r\nthe interpretation of conflicting charters.[488] Elaborate accounts of\r\nmunicipal expenditure were made yet more arduous by the system of Roman\r\nnumerals which constantly baffled his best efforts at exact addition.\r\nThe keeping of the town rolls in general was a very serious occupation;\r\nin the time of Edward the Fourth the yearly rolls of Ipswich (called\r\nDogget Rolls from the clerk’s docquet or table of contents) form\r\nbundles as big as a garden roller;[489] and in Nottingham twenty rolls\r\nwere covered within and without in a single year with the list of\r\npleas against foreigners alone. In fact, the supply of parchment began\r\nto fall short of the prodigious demands of the town clerks, who were\r\ndriven to take to paper, either to economize the trifling sum allowed\r\nthem for the expense of parchment, or in obedience to a direct order\r\nfrom the corporation.[490] As they added roll to roll and book to\r\nbook, they from time to time relieved the tedious labour by adorning\r\nthe town accounts with sketches and ornaments, with a snatch of French\r\nsong or a few quibbles or catches of very moderate wit,[491] with a\r\nrugged ballad on the evils of over-eating,[492] or a final sigh of\r\nsatisfaction from a German copyist, “Explicit hic totum; pro Christo da\r\nmihi potum!”[493]\r\n\r\nThe town clerk, in fact, was to the local government what two centuries\r\nearlier the trained lay-lawyers had been to the central administration.\r\nFrom mere superiority of education, as a scholar and linguist, an\r\naccomplished lawyer, something of a historian and an antiquary, a\r\nskilled accountant, a scribe trained to finer penmanship and more\r\nexact views of spelling than the ordinary councillor, or even than\r\nthe mayor himself, the clerk must have exercized an easy intellectual\r\nsupremacy.[494] Responsible only to the mayor, holding his post\r\nyear after year in perfect security, he remained among the changing\r\nofficers about him a permanent force, a municipal chancellor in whom\r\nwas embodied a continuous tradition of administration and a fixed\r\njurisprudence.[495] Thriving towns of the fifteenth century vied with\r\none another in seeking out able professionals for the post. Bridgewater\r\nengaged a man who seems to have been in practice as attorney or notary\r\npublic in Oxford; and as early as the fourteenth century a chamberlain\r\nof London wrote letters under the common seal at Romney. Winchester\r\nlooked yet farther afield, and seems to have employed a German.[496]\r\nAn able lawyer in those days could command the market, as we see by\r\nthe story of Thomas Caxton (probably a brother of William Caxton the\r\nprinter), who spent a busy professional career of forty years going\r\nfrom town to town wherever he could best sell his services. A native\r\nof Tenterden, he was brought up to the law, and in 1436 was engaged in\r\na plea of debt in Romney against one William-at-the-Mill. In 1454 he\r\nwas practising as an attorney at Tenterden, and was the leading man\r\nof law in its negotiations with Rye to resist the union of the two\r\ntowns into a single corporation. In 1458 he entered the service of\r\nLydd, which was then in the thick of its troubles about boundaries and\r\nfranchises, and was paid £2 13_s._ 4_d._ a year, or double the salary\r\nof his predecessor, and in addition was soon after promised a gown\r\nevery year, while ultimately his pay was raised to £4—a sum which at\r\nthat time was only given by great commercial towns such as Bristol or\r\nSouthampton.[497] On his resignation Lydd returned to its old custom\r\nand once more paid to his successor the original salary of 6_s._\r\n8_d._ a quarter, but the corporation still continued to employ Caxton\r\nconstantly on very profitable terms for himself, often sending him to\r\nLondon on business, or to carry on negotiations with the king. In 1470,\r\nwhen Lydd had been running into danger on every side, first sending men\r\nto fight under Warwick, and then paying £9 for another body of troops\r\nto go to the help of King Edward, the burghers made Caxton their\r\ntreasurer, and two years later he was elected bailiff, and a town clerk\r\nput under him of his own training. We next find him in 1474 as clerk in\r\nRomney; but he was called back again to Lydd in 1476, and employed to\r\nwrite out its “customall” in his fine bold hand. A yet more important\r\ntown however now cast longing eyes on the successful lawyer, and he\r\nwas drawn away from Lydd to Sandwich, where he finally settled down as\r\ncommon clerk.\r\n\r\nIn fact for professional men of talent in the middle class a new and\r\ncomparatively brilliant career was now opened in the towns.[498]\r\nNicholas Lancaster, town clerk of York from 1477 to 1480, was a\r\nbachelor of laws, who in 1483 became one of the king’s council, was in\r\n1484 alderman of York, and in 1485 mayor.[499] Easingwold, who kept the\r\nrolls of Nottingham for nearly thirty years (from 1478 to 1506), wrote\r\nhimself down as “gentleman” among the yeomen, braziers, and smiths,\r\nwho paid their 6_s._ 8_d._ along with him to gain the freedom of the\r\nborough,[500] and in his later signatures still kept up the solitary\r\ndistinction of this title, which scarcely occurs in the records save\r\nafter his name. An educated man with a very tolerable knowledge of\r\nLatin, though he preferred English, he served his adopted town well,\r\nand in his time the old court rolls, which had been carelessly kept\r\nin paper books for thirty years before his coming, were replaced by\r\nparchment rolls with very full and elaborate accounts in a singularly\r\nbeautiful and exact writing.[501]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that in governing bodies whose members were thus\r\ndistinguished from the common mass of burghers by wealth, social\r\nposition, culture, who were independent of the people they ruled,\r\nvery watchful in the matter of their legal or customary rights, and\r\nabundantly supplied in case of difficulty with advice in the law\r\nby the recorder or the town clerk or the special counsel retained\r\nin their service, no influence was wanting which could foster the\r\nofficial spirit in its most extreme form, with its pride of position,\r\nits administrative pretensions, its love of legal definition, and its\r\nanxiety for “good order.” “The worshipful men of the great clothing” or\r\n“the imperial co-citizens” of some very minor borough ruled for their\r\nown ends with frankness and capacity; while their natural rallying\r\ncry of “good rule and substantial order”[502] was so well understood\r\nat court that they could always confidently count on support from\r\nthat quarter. The alarm of the mob, which since the Peasant Revolt\r\nhad troubled statesmen at Westminster as well as aldermen in the\r\nboroughs, drew the ruling classes generally into close alliance; and\r\ntowards the end of the fifteenth century, we constantly find the town\r\nofficers turning with apprehension to the court for aid, and kings\r\nanxiously lending succour to the corporations. The Wars of the Roses\r\nand dynastic quarrels which once appeared to pass so lightly over the\r\nboroughs, scarcely touching them with a passing alarm of material\r\ncalamity, were not brought to a close before they had left a terrible\r\nand abiding impress on the civil life of the people. The shaking of\r\nthe national security, the wild hopes and the panic-stricken fears of\r\nrebellion, had their inevitable conclusion in tightening the hold of\r\nauthority. In the boroughs the governing bodies, terrified at the signs\r\nof bitter discontent in the subject populace, and justly trembling\r\nlest under some feint of political obedience, the mass of the people\r\nmight be arrayed against their rulers and clamour against wrong and\r\ninjustice might fill the streets, raised a cry for protection against\r\nsocial anarchy; and the cry was eagerly responded to by kings whose\r\ntitle to the crown was their strong will and heavy hand. The progress\r\nof liberty was violently arrested by the fears that shook the settled\r\nclasses before threatenings of revolt. “It seemeth that the world is\r\nall quavering; it will reboil somewhere,” onlookers said; men walked\r\nwith redoubled wariness in an “unstable” and “right queasy” world,[503]\r\nand while anxious kings urged the mayor and his council to make good\r\nand fearful example of indisposed commons, aldermen gladly locked the\r\ndoors of the town-hall, and cast into the freeman’s dungeon the burgher\r\nwho still prated of a free community.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n We do not know when or how the leading men of Bristol assumed a\r\n position of special privilege. All we know is that troubles grew out\r\n of a quarrel about customs in the port and market, &c., in which\r\n fourteen of the citizens “were seen to have the prerogative,” while\r\n the community asserted that the burgesses were all of one condition\r\n and were equals in liberties and privileges. After many disputes\r\n the case was brought before the judges of the king’s court, but the\r\n Fourteen so arranged matters that foreigners or aliens were associated\r\n with them in the inquisition, which the community alleged to be\r\n against the liberties of the town. Seeing that their arguments were\r\n rejected and that their cause was going to be lost, not by reason but\r\n by favour, the leaders of the people angrily went out of the judgment\r\n hall and proclaimed to the mob that the judges were favouring their\r\n enemies. The whole people, called out by the ringing of the common\r\n bell, flocked into the hall; and there was terrible clamour and a free\r\n fight with fists and clubs; twenty men were killed; and terror seized\r\n alike on the noble and ignoble, who tried to escape by windows and\r\n roofs at the risk of their lives; while even the judges prayed to be\r\n allowed to fly by the help of the mayor, who himself could scarcely\r\n soothe the “vast crowd of malefactors.” About eighty men were summoned\r\n for the riot, and not appearing before the judges were banished, but\r\n stayed on nevertheless comfortably in the town and were well cared for\r\n by their fellow rebels. It was in fact the Fourteen who judged it wise\r\n to leave Bristol, thinking it useless to remain in such a storm. (See\r\n the extract from the life of Edward the Second by a monk of Malmesbury\r\n given in Seyer’s Bristol, ii. 94.)\r\n\r\n To quell this tumult the king in 1312 took the government into his\r\n own hand and appointed Bartholomew of Baddlesmere, constable of the\r\n castle, as custos; but the mayor and bailiffs, asserting that the\r\n letter had not been addressed to the _community_, and further that\r\n the custody of the town had been previously given to them, refused to\r\n obey orders, and kept the gates of the castle and town for thirty-five\r\n weeks, building a wall against the castle and refusing to let the\r\n king’s men go out to fetch victuals save at the will of the community.\r\n Of their own authority they made John the Taverner mayor, John of\r\n Horncastle and Richard Legate bailiffs, and John Hazard coroner,\r\n without making them take their oath of king or constable; and by\r\n force of arms seized the custody of the prison, levied for their own\r\n purposes the revenues from the town and port which ought to have been\r\n collected for the king, and administered justice. The king’s judges\r\n and servants were imprisoned or driven from the town; the Fourteen\r\n and half a dozen partizans, who had mostly been in office, were not\r\n allowed to return to the town in spite of the king’s injunction, and\r\n the community seized their goods to the value of £2,000, and drove out\r\n their wives, freemen, and tenants.\r\n\r\n The rebellion lasted for two years. In 1316 six citizens representing\r\n the community of Bristol were summoned before the king’s council to\r\n answer for these offences. They denied the charges, and refused to\r\n submit unless life and limb, rents and land, were secured to them. The\r\n king, looking on the case as one of evil example, ordered Bristol to\r\n be besieged by sea and land, and after attempting to hold out for some\r\n days in the hope that the troops might be called away to the Scotch\r\n war, the town surrendered half in ruins. The leaders were put in\r\n prison and the multitude terrified by a series of heavy punishments.\r\n The banished party returned in triumph to power, and appeared, twelve\r\n of them, before the king’s council, with the allotted fine of four\r\n thousand marks to have pardon for all the city’s offences, and to have\r\n back the franchise of the town. The rebel mayor and his immediate\r\n friends, excluded from mercy, went in their turn into exile. (See the\r\n account extracted from Rolls of Parliament 9 Edward II. by Seyer.\r\n Memoirs of Bristol, ii. 89 to 105.)\r\n\r\n After this matters seem to have gone on as before, a few influential\r\n families still taking the leading place. One, Turtle, was mayor ten\r\n times, and another, Tilly, held office for four years. But in 1344,\r\n the popular party insisted on the appointment of Forty-eight “of the\r\n chiefest and discreetest” burgesses, to be the mayor’s councillors\r\n and assistants. When Bristol was made into a county in 1373 the new\r\n charter recognized the system established in 1344, and provided that\r\n the mayor and sheriff with the assent of the commonalty should choose\r\n a Council of Forty, whose consent was required for all ordinances, and\r\n who took part in municipal elections; while the five aldermen of the\r\n wards were chosen by the people from among the ex-mayors or members of\r\n the common council. By a later charter of 1499 it was settled that six\r\n aldermen were to be elected for life by the mayor and common council,\r\n and were to have the authority of London aldermen (Charter Henry VII.,\r\n 1499. Seyer’s Charters and Letters Patent of Bristol, 123), while the\r\n common council itself was to be elected by the mayor and two aldermen\r\n chosen by him, with the assent of the commonalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TOWN COUNCIL\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE fifteenth century has been popularly taken as the time when\r\nvictory crowned the local oligarchies and liberty fled from the\r\nEnglish boroughs, and the restriction of popular rights has sometimes\r\nbeen attributed to the charters of incorporation given under Henry\r\nthe Sixth. In this, as in many other respects, the luckless age has\r\nlong lain under a heavy weight of accusations which might more fairly\r\nbe distributed among other centuries; for in most towns the work of\r\nadapting the primitive town constitutions to oligarchic government\r\nhad practically been accomplished long before the days of Henry.[504]\r\nIndeed it seems as though the characteristic movement of this time, a\r\nmovement which naturally sprang out of the industrial developement\r\nof the Middle Ages, was the effort to enlarge the sphere of political\r\nactivity. Far from being a time of apathy in local politics, it was a\r\ntime of acute excitement. Townspeople on all sides were awakening to\r\nthe sense that the free community of which their fathers had talked had\r\nstill to be created; and were making perhaps the first organized attack\r\non the monopoly of “the magnates,” and the first practical attempt to\r\ndeal with the problem which confronts Englishmen to-day—the problem\r\nof how to combine popular control with good administration. Traditions\r\nof ancient rights which the commonalty theoretically held by law and\r\ncharter mingled with the ambitions of a new world of enterprise, and,\r\nas we have seen, the manufacturing classes by asserting their right to\r\nhave some share in the work of government, did here and there for the\r\nfirst time bring the commonalty into the council chamber.\r\n\r\nThe problem of government was indeed no longer so simple as it had\r\nbeen when “the magnates” first easily assumed the control of the town\r\ndestinies. As the centuries went on, bringing their commercial and\r\nindustrial revolutions, the growth of capital and the organization of\r\nlabour, new standards of administration and a more anxious vigilance\r\non the part of the central authority, the balance of power in local\r\ngovernments began to sway to one side or the other under the pressure\r\nof contending forces. Every political tendency of the time went to\r\nstrengthen the administrative body, and maintain the authority of\r\nthe select council. But, on the other hand, the mass of the commons\r\nwere neither so poor nor so helpless as they had once been. The\r\nmanufacturing classes waxed fat and kicked. Enriched by trade and\r\ndisciplined by industrial training, organized in guilds, and practised\r\nin such self-government as this implied, restless under growing\r\ntaxation, clamorous for advancement in well-being, tormented by petty\r\ntyranny, they were growing into a real power; and amid all the ugliness\r\nand violence and suffering of the troubled crowd which Langland brings\r\nbefore us at the close of the fourteenth century, we cannot but feel\r\nthe stir of the coming revolution, and of a world transforming itself\r\nunder the power of some new force. To the eye of the contemporary\r\nobserver the merchants have become too clever at their business, the\r\nlawyers too shrewd, the common people everywhere too independent;\r\nthe poor are less content to starve, and are looking for the easiest\r\nways of getting hot meat and ale and comfortable chimney corners;\r\nthe ploughman will not work till hunger has buffeted him so “that he\r\nlooked like a lantern all his life after”;[505] if the peasant was for\r\na moment safe from actual starvation, he was ready to defy the very\r\nStatute of Labourers itself.[506] On all sides there is the movement\r\nof a growing discontent[507]—the criticism and impatience that are\r\nborn of a new hope. We have a sense of the vague trouble of a people\r\ngrown too rich and too busy and too energetic for the old restraints—a\r\npeople that had outgrown its “childish things.” Nature itself seemed to\r\nhave been dragged within the circle of some mysterious change, and its\r\nold stately courses turned into confusion—\r\n\r\n  “Neither the sea nor the sand nor the seed yieldeth\r\n  As they wont were....\r\n\r\n         *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  Weatherwise shipmen now and other witty people\r\n  Have no belief to the lyft nor to the lode star.\r\n  Astronomers all day in their art failen\r\n  That whilom warned men before what should befall after.”[508]\r\n\r\nIn presence of such a world—a world in restless and perpetual\r\nmovement—it is difficult to make general statements of what was\r\nlikely or “natural” to happen. In some cases the governing class,\r\nterrified by the new force which was stirring the masses of the people,\r\neluded any serious conflict by making terms with the upper groups of\r\nthe middle class, thus detaching to their own side the leaders of\r\nrevolt; and a new oligarchy was formed out of the upper and middle\r\nsections of the community—an oligarchy stronger and wider than the\r\nold, and with promise of more permanent existence. In other cases the\r\npeople had the advantage, and a more liberal settlement was for a time\r\nbrought about in the interests of the commonalty; so that while the\r\nTown Council of one borough appears as a chosen band ostentatiously\r\narrayed for the protection of a successful oligarchy, we may see it\r\nfiguring in another as the advanced guard of the commons entrenched\r\nin the enemy’s country. Never, in fact, did any people endeavour to\r\nsolve the difficulty of creating an efficient government with such\r\nendless resource and ingenuity as the mediæval burghers, who as need\r\narose, flung themselves into the art of constitution making with all\r\nthe persistence, temperance, energy, and economy in patching up ancient\r\nmodels and finding new use for old materials in which Englishmen for\r\ncenturies have found their pride.[509] The charters granted to them\r\nallowed wide limits within which they might try their experiments and\r\nplan their own mode of government at their will. A local scheme of\r\nadministration was devised; and when they had framed their system it\r\nmight depend on the sanction of local custom, or for greater security\r\nand authority it might be defined and ordained by a new charter; and if\r\nagain the chartered constitution proved unsatisfactory, the townsfolk\r\nhad only to agree among themselves on new methods, and have them once\r\nmore embodied in a fresh grant from the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe whole character of municipal government was thus indefinitely\r\nmodified by local circumstances—by the position or the special\r\nindustry of the borough, the nature of its tenure and its compact\r\nwith the lord of the manor, the power of the merchants or the\r\nowners of property within its walls; and nothing is more surprising\r\nthan the variety and intricacy of political systems with which the\r\nmediæval burghers were familiar. As free in theory as they were\r\nfree in practice, under bondage to no fixed democratic creed, they\r\nadopted indiscriminately any method that commended itself—whether\r\nof election direct or indirect, election tempered by nomination,\r\nminority representation, public voting, or arrangements by which voters\r\nrecorded their will secretly one by one.[510] Every borough, for\r\nexample, had its own fashion of choosing its mayor. We have seen that\r\nin Sandwich the whole people made the election; but in Winchester the\r\ncouncil of twenty-four chose two men and the outgoing mayor nominated\r\none of them as his successor;[511] while in Southampton the plan\r\nwas reversed and the outgoing mayor in the presence of bailiffs and\r\ncouncil nominated two burgesses from whom the assembly was bound to\r\nelect one,[512] nor could an occasional outbreak of popular discontent\r\ndo more than convince the commons afresh of their true impotence.\r\nMidway between these extremes came an endless variety of customs,\r\noften of elaborate complexity.[513] When the selection of the mayor\r\nwas nominally left to the whole “people in the hall,” their choice\r\nwas often limited and checked in one way or another. They must take\r\nhim from among the upper council; or from among men who had already\r\nserved as mayors or sheriffs; or they must send two names to the first\r\nchamber for approval, of whom this discreet company might choose one;\r\nor perhaps the council itself nominated two or three candidates for\r\nthe freemen’s choice, as a curb to the license of popular judgment;\r\nor the matter was yet more effectually settled by a decision that the\r\ncouncil alone should elect the mayor.[514] In some boroughs a special\r\njury was chosen by the citizens for the purpose of electing the chief\r\nofficers—either a single jury of twelve as at Bridgnorth,[515] or a\r\ndouble jury of twenty-four as at Colchester or Preston;[516] and the\r\nelection of the jury itself was often far from being a simple matter,\r\nas we see at Lynn. Occasionally the necessity of recognizing various\r\ninterests within the town and giving to them special influence in\r\nthe municipal constitution seems to have added a local complication,\r\nas in Canterbury, where the aldermen were in early times hereditary\r\nowners and lords of the several wards of the town, and retained in\r\nconsequence rights which were not finally extinguished till the reign\r\nof Henry the Eighth; here two “triours” were chosen, one by the two\r\noutgoing bailiffs together with the aldermen, the other by the commons\r\nor “council of the thirty-six”; these two triours then appointed twelve\r\nmen from among the council, and the twelve finally chose the bailiffs\r\nfor the next year.[517]\r\n\r\nIn appointing the other members of the corporation there was the same\r\ndiversity of method, with a free use of the plan of nomination, so\r\nthat a mixed system was sometimes evolved where half the corporation\r\nwas elected by the people and the remainder nominated by the mayor or\r\ncouncil. The town councillors might be chosen yearly by the burgesses,\r\nor by a jury nominated for the purpose; they might be turned into a new\r\nclass of permanent officials by being elected for life; or made into an\r\nexclusive aristocratic body by being allowed to fill up all vacancies\r\nthemselves; and in towns with a double council any two of these plans\r\nmight be tried together; or both bodies might be chosen by some one\r\nsystem. An inevitable tendency to make themselves as independent as\r\npossible of the people over whom they ruled naturally guided the\r\ncouncillors to the belief that the manner of their election was best\r\nmanaged by themselves, and there were cases where not only the upper\r\nbut the lower chamber became self-electing bodies in which the members\r\nheld office for life.[518]\r\n\r\nIn short every conceivable experiment in government was tried in\r\none town or another, or in the same town at different times, to the\r\ngreat confusion of systematic order. In one the original council of\r\ntwelve or twenty-four might be maintained in its early representative\r\ncharacter;[519] in another its constitution was gradually transformed.\r\nSometimes besides the upper council the burghers set up a second\r\nchamber of sixteen or eighty or twenty-four or thirty-six or forty or\r\nforty-eight,[520] and the “worshipful and discreet members of the\r\nclothing,” or the “high election,” had to share their powers more or\r\nless with the “low election”, “the sad and discreet” company arrayed\r\nin plain suits with no finery of fur and velvet. Hereditary owners of\r\nland might sit on the council of one borough, and non-burgesses join\r\nthe council of another. Aldermen might be forced on the people, or they\r\nmight be forbidden by the authorities.[521] As occasion served the\r\ntownsfolk perhaps attempted to form a representative council out of a\r\njury of electors or of arbitrators, or from a committee of the common\r\nassembly, or delegated members from the crafts.\r\n\r\nUnderneath this apparent confusion certain broad tendencies can be\r\ndiscerned; and it may be that with further study these tendencies will\r\nbe found to have borne a different character in various districts\r\nof the country, and to have been influenced not only by political\r\ntraditions, but by special conditions of trade and industry. As yet\r\nthere are not collected materials to justify any general theory; but\r\nsomething may be learned by observing the constitutional changes which\r\nactually took place in a few boroughs; and by judging how far these\r\nconstitutional changes can be adequately summed up in the theory of\r\na continuous backsliding from popular freedom to the despotism of\r\na privileged group of opulent traders. A few instances which have\r\nbeen chosen at hazard may serve to illustrate how various were the\r\nconditions under which civic life was carried on, and how these\r\nconditions influenced the political situation, and were reflected in\r\nthe temper and form of government. They fall naturally into three\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\nI. Occasionally it seems to have happened, as at Southampton, that\r\nthe original single council of twelve was retained till after the\r\nReformation, in spite of sporadic attempts of the commons to vindicate\r\ntheir strength, whether through the general assembly or by some other\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nII. In the great majority of towns however a second council was\r\nformed—in most cases by creating a sort of committee of the general\r\nassembly. Whether the common people refused to come to assemblies as\r\nwas stated at Norwich, or whether their absence was but a pretext of\r\nthe governors, it is hard to say; but apparently a system commonly\r\ngrew up of calling together on important occasions a group of selected\r\ncitizens. Bailiffs and mayors who were anxious to get rid of unruly\r\nand, as they judged, superfluous elements in the town meetings; or\r\nwho wished to compel a sufficient number of voters to come together\r\nto carry on business; might fall back on the expedient of sending out\r\nsummonses to certain chosen householders whenever an assembly was to\r\nbe held, and might thus in informal fashion create a sympathetic and\r\nobedient gathering to endorse the action of the ruling body. Presently\r\nperhaps fines were inflicted in case the summons was neglected; and\r\nwhen it was once clearly established that a definite number of members\r\nwere thus bound to assemble at the mayor’s bidding for the conduct of\r\nbusiness, and when further this body was given the power of the whole\r\nassembly in deciding on all matters that concerned the common interest,\r\nit is clear that a council of the commons had been created—a permanent\r\nbody endowed, whether with or without their consent, with the burghers’\r\nrights of legislation. In a number of towns, such as Coventry,\r\nHereford, Leicester, and many more, the summons to the council was sent\r\nout by the mayor, and the system to some extent represented a victory\r\nof the oligarchy; we can perhaps trace in Nottingham the informal\r\ngrowth of this custom and its effects.\r\n\r\nIII. There were boroughs, however, in which the second council was the\r\nmonument of a popular victory; and of these Norwich and Sandwich may\r\nserve as instances; in Lynn the system was developed under peculiar\r\ncircumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n I add here some very brief notes of constitutional changes in a few\r\n boroughs, which took place in the later middle ages. They all indicate\r\n a widespread struggle between the upper and lower sections of the\r\n community during the fifteenth century. A closer study shows that this\r\n movement must not be compared to the flicker of an expiring flame,\r\n but rather expresses the quick burning of a new fire. In some of the\r\n instances given below the oligarchy seems to have proved the more\r\n powerful, in others the middle class.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n In 1373 the custom of Colchester was that the whole community chose\r\n four “sufficient men” (afterwards termed headmen), one from each\r\n ward, “of good conversation, and who had never been bailiffs;” and\r\n these, being sworn, elected five more from each ward, who likewise\r\n had never been bailiffs, making together with themselves twenty-four.\r\n Two at least of every five thus chosen were to be of the common\r\n council. The twenty-four elected the two bailiffs, eight aldermen,\r\n and other officers. Then bailiffs and aldermen together chose sixteen\r\n of the “wisest and most understanding people in the burgh;” which\r\n sixteen jointly with them carried on the government. “They were to\r\n meet in assembly at least four times a year; and if any burgess had\r\n a proposition to make to his governors he was to deliver it to the\r\n bailiffs in writing, and receive an answer at the next assembly.”\r\n Edward the Fourth in his new charter directed bailiffs and aldermen\r\n and the sixteen to choose sixteen other persons, four from each ward,\r\n to be a common council with “power to make reasonable ordinances and\r\n constitutions for the good of the borough.” The first sixteen were\r\n afterwards styled Primum Concilium, the latter Secundum Concilium.\r\n\r\n Assemblies were held in the moot hall for electing officers and making\r\n bye-laws. No ordinances could be passed unless twenty-five members\r\n were present. Fines were raised from those who did not come or who\r\n came after the doors were shut. (Cromwell’s Colchester, 264-5, 269.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Canterbury was originally governed by a portreeve appointed by the\r\n king; but at least as early as the thirteenth century the portreeve\r\n was replaced by two bailiffs, who were assisted by a council of\r\n twelve aldermen, or “wisest men,” and by thirty-six “probi homines”\r\n or “jurati.” There is reason to believe that the bench or chamber of\r\n twelve exercised from the first the powers which belonged to them in\r\n the fifteenth century. They were sworn to keep the law days twice\r\n a year, to preserve the memory of the limits and bounds of their\r\n aldermanries, and to give good counsel to the mayor; they received all\r\n the accounts of the money in the cofferer’s keeping; and with them\r\n rested the power to make all bye-laws. (See the cofferer’s oath in\r\n muniments of city. A. 1.)\r\n\r\n There were some peculiar features about this upper council. The six\r\n aldermanries of which the city consisted had been originally held\r\n by the Crown “in capite,” but when Henry the Third granted the city\r\n to the citizens to hold in fee-ferm the offices were annexed to the\r\n fee-ferm, and the owners from that time held of the citizens. The\r\n wards, however, still remained the property of certain families in\r\n the county of Kent, estates which could be bequeathed by will, and\r\n which descended for generations from father to son. Their hereditary\r\n governors need not be either freemen or inhabitants of the city, and\r\n might moreover make their profit if they chose by leasing out the\r\n post. At one time S. Augustine’s held an aldermanry at Canterbury\r\n (Madox, 252); and at the inquisition of 1285 it was proved that\r\n William de Godstede, who held the aldermanry of Westgate from the\r\n community of the city at a rent of 3_s._ 4_d._, had leased it to the\r\n rector of Sturry, two miles away, for 100_s._ a year. At the same\r\n time their position in the city was most influential, for not only\r\n had they the usual police control of their wards as in other towns,\r\n but they were _ex-officio_ members of the chamber of twelve, who\r\n formed the counsellors of the mayor in the government of the town.\r\n There they claimed superior place and privileges to their brethren,\r\n ranking in dignity next to the mayor and above the other six members\r\n of the chamber; the fine for reviling the mayor being 100_s._; for the\r\n aldermen, 60_s._; for the men of the chamber, 40_s._; and for the\r\n thirty-six men of the council, 20_s._ The council of thirty-six may\r\n possibly have arisen out of the necessity of securing the attendance\r\n at the burghmote of a sufficient number of freemen. Their duties as\r\n defined by the oath customary in 1456 were very limited in character.\r\n “This hear ye, mayor, that I will be true to King Edward and his\r\n heirs, and true attendance make to the mayor of the city or his deputy\r\n at such times as I shall be desired or called, and keep the days of\r\n the burghmote, and truly keep the counsel of the said burghmote, and\r\n all other things do as one of the common council.” They seem to have\r\n had no control over the town treasure, nor any power to propose laws,\r\n and at first had apparently no power even to reject them. It would\r\n appear that juries were chosen among their body at the burgh court,\r\n and they took part in the election of the bailiffs.\r\n\r\n A violent dispute broke out in 1445 as to the right mode of electing\r\n the bailiffs, and when Cardinal Beaufort visited the city bribes\r\n were used to win his influence in settling the quarrel. The matter\r\n ended by the grant of a new charter to the city in 1448, by which the\r\n bailiffs were replaced by a mayor. By this charter, the king gave\r\n power to hear pleas and to collect such tallages as the mayor and\r\n aldermen may consider necessary for the maintenance of the city, but\r\n of the council of thirty-six there was no mention. As early as 1429,\r\n however, its share in the government seems to have been recognized.\r\n The name “common council” was recognized in the oath used in 1456; and\r\n that it represented the people at large is clear from the statement\r\n in 1489 that the thirty-six were “sworn to the council of this city\r\n by the assent of all the commonalty of the city.” Finally in 1474 it\r\n was decreed that every act or ordinance made by the mayor and aldermen\r\n “with the assent of such of the thirty-six citizens for the commonalty\r\n of the said city chosen as it shall like the mayor and aldermen” was\r\n to be enrolled in the common chamber; and in this same year ordinances\r\n were made by the mayor, five aldermen, the sheriff of Canterbury,\r\n and two chamberlains; seven names are then given (who may possibly\r\n have formed the rest of the chamber of twelve with the five aldermen\r\n already mentioned), and thirty-six citizens (not mentioned by name)\r\n elected by the community for the public good of the city. In 1497\r\n certain business in London was said to have been done by order of the\r\n mayor, aldermen, council, and commonalty. (Records of Burghmote Court.\r\n Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 140, 146, 167, 169-173. Hundred Rolls, i. 49-55.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n In Shrewsbury, before the plague, twelve men were chosen who\r\n apparently elected the bailiffs, and presented their accounts yearly\r\n to six men chosen by the commonalty. In 1380 the town was torn\r\n by dissensions, and apparently some change had been made in the\r\n municipal constitution, for the commonalty under the direction of\r\n the Earl of Arundel now agreed to return to the form of government\r\n practised at the time of the plague. This lasted till 1389. Discords\r\n and debates still, however, continued, and the commonalty met in\r\n 1389 in the presence of the abbot and various lords to find a remedy\r\n for the misgovernment of the town. It was agreed that the bailiffs\r\n should nominate a council of twenty-five, which council in its turn\r\n should elect for the coming year the bailiffs, the coroners, and six\r\n cessors. The cessors were to oversee the spending of town moneys and\r\n to make up their accounts for six auditors chosen by the commonalty.\r\n All burgesses were to be present at elections. The bailiffs only\r\n appointed the serjeants. The collectors of murage might be dismissed\r\n during their year of office for any fault. Any burgess who resisted\r\n these ordinances or gave his opinion in the common assembly was to be\r\n punished. Ordinances were to be read openly every year.\r\n\r\n A new composition made in 1433 gave the council of twenty-five right\r\n to choose a serjeant in addition to the two appointed by the bailiffs;\r\n he was to collect the rents due from burgesses for the ferm of the\r\n town. Further, the commons’ rights in electing the six auditors were\r\n affirmed and protected from encroachment “in deceit of the said\r\n commons.” The members of Parliament were also to be elected by the\r\n whole of the commons. All the burgesses were ordered to attend at the\r\n guild hall when summoned, and the common seal was to be kept by four\r\n men chosen by the commons. Lastly, the bailiffs and commons were to\r\n elect twelve worthy men who were to serve as continual assistants\r\n to the bailiffs for the term of their lives. In case of death the\r\n bailiffs and commons were to elect another councillor. The burgesses\r\n entreat that this composition shall be confirmed by Parliament because\r\n in the case of previous accords the commonalty could not bring action\r\n against the bailiffs for contravention of them.\r\n\r\n In 1444 the council of twelve were given the name of aldermen. The\r\n common council was to act for the whole body of burgesses, who in the\r\n assemblies at the guild hall were no longer to answer in their own\r\n persons, but to show their advice to the twenty-four who were then to\r\n consult among themselves and to elect a speaker who was to declare\r\n their will to the bailiffs and aldermen.\r\n\r\n At the same time the nomination of the electing jury of twenty-five\r\n was taken out of the hands of the bailiff; henceforth they were to\r\n elect two of the common council, and these two were to appoint the\r\n twenty-five electors, as well as the six auditors and the coroners.\r\n The commons were also to choose a chamberlain or treasurer. (Owen’s\r\n Shrewsbury, i. 168-174, 207-9, 212, 216.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n In Winchester “of the heads of the city should be four and twenty\r\n sworn instead of the most good men and of the wisest of the town\r\n for to truly help and counsel the mayor”; and the mayor was to be\r\n “chosen by the common granting of the four and twenty sworn, and of\r\n the commune, principal ‘sosteynere’ of the franchise.” The mayor and\r\n the twenty-four then nominated four men to serve as bailiffs, and two\r\n of these were chosen by the commons. For levying taxes six men were\r\n chosen “by the common granting and sworn, three of the four-and-twenty\r\n and three of the commune.” This was in and before the fourteenth\r\n century. At a later time the twenty-four named two men for mayor and\r\n the mayor chose one; while for the two bailiffs the twenty-four chose\r\n four men and the commonalty selected one of them, and in their turn\r\n chose four more, of whom the twenty-four selected one. The common seal\r\n was kept in a large coffer with two locks; one of the twenty-four was\r\n chosen to keep one key, and one of the commons to keep the other.\r\n (Eng. Guilds, 349-50, 356. Kitchin’s Winchester, 164-5.)\r\n\r\n In the early fifteenth century laws, etc., were made by the mayor and\r\n his peers and all the community of the city. (Gross, ii. 258-9.) The\r\n “full assembly” of 1477 mentions the mayor and fifty-seven of his\r\n peers then present (Ibid. 262). It is a matter for inquiry whether\r\n the thirty-three citizens added to the twenty-four were specially\r\n summoned householders, and whether Winchester followed in its common\r\n council the type of Leicester or of Norwich.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n Leicester had originally a council of twenty-four; and the commons\r\n had a right at first to gather at elections or at a Common Hall and\r\n watch the proceedings of the council. They had, however, no right to\r\n interfere with business, and in 1467 a fine was imposed on any who\r\n cried out or named aloud one of the mayor’s brethren to the office\r\n of the mayoralty. In the fifteenth century there were rumours and\r\n speech of ungodly rules and demeanings among the people, and in 1489\r\n “whereas such persons as be of little substance or reason, and not\r\n contributors, or else full little, to the charges” still continued\r\n “their exclamations and headiness,” they were excluded as a body\r\n from the Common Hall, and the mayor, bailiffs, and Twenty-four, were\r\n ordered only to summon forty-eight and no more of the most wise and\r\n sad of the commoners after their discretion. In the later part of the\r\n fifteenth century orders were made by the mayor and “his brethren\r\n called the Twenty-four and the whole company of the Forty-eight, then\r\n and there assembled, for and in the name of the whole body of the\r\n corporation of the town.” (Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 423; Thomson, Mun.\r\n Hist. 55-6, 80-84.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n In 1553 “the mayor and burgesses” of Gloucester claimed to have had\r\n power time out of mind to ordain, constitute, and hold a court in\r\n their Council House, and to call many and divers men to their council\r\n at the same court and to compel and swear them in of their council.\r\n This summoning of additional councillors seems to have made up the\r\n “Common Council.” In 1526 it was stated that “it has been the custom\r\n time out of mind to elect certain chief burgesses, sometimes more\r\n sometimes less in number,” to form a common council; and the number\r\n was then fixed at forty, twelve of whom were to be aldermen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF SOUTHAMPTON\r\n\r\n\r\nTHERE are two grounds on which Southampton may claim to stand first\r\namong examples of early municipal government. For centuries it was\r\nthe great port of the south—the harbour where for England the trade\r\nof the whole world converged, where carracks of Flanders and galleys\r\nfrom Venice met to pour upon its wharves the treasures of the northern\r\nand the southern seas. And for centuries its government survived, as\r\nperhaps such a government survived nowhere else in England, in the\r\norder appointed by its first planters, with none of its hedges broken\r\ndown by compromise, nor its pure springs stained by infiltration of\r\npopular and democratic fervours. It is possible that the two facts\r\nare intimately bound together, and that the destiny of a Channel port\r\ndetermined the somewhat unusual lot of the Southampton municipality.\r\n\r\nThe industrial experiences of Southampton had been very felicitous.\r\nNearly forty trades are mentioned in the town records of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, and there were many more than these, carried on not only by\r\nthe English inhabitants but by settlers come from Burgundy, Flanders,\r\nDenmark, and Lombardy, and the French colony established in Rochelle\r\nLane and French Street. Wool of all kind was sold in the market,\r\ncoarse, black, broken, and lambs’ wool, much of which was sent to the\r\nIsle of Wight to be made up into web. Coloured “Paris candles” were\r\nmanufactured as early as 1297. Cheese was made in great quantities, and\r\ncider. Bends of elms for ploughs were brought from Abingdon.[522] Hemp\r\nwas grown for the making of cords, and the shipbuilding trade for which\r\nthe town was so noted in the time of Henry the Fifth must have been\r\nalready practised in far earlier days, to judge from the history of the\r\nSouthampton shipping.[523]\r\n\r\nHome industries, however, held a very modest position in Southampton\r\ncompared with the fine figure made by its foreign commerce. Ships from\r\nthe West bringing “cloth of Ireland,” perhaps drugget from Drogheda or\r\nfrom Sligo, met vessels carrying wine from the French ports, herrings\r\nand wax and tapestry from Brittany, alum from Biscay and from Genoa,\r\nEastern spices from the depôts of the Rhine, while harbour dues were\r\npaid for salt-fish, pitch, bitumen, charcoal, and wood from the ports\r\nof the Baltic.[524] The great glory of the town lay however in its\r\ndirect trade with the Mediterranean. When in the reign of Edward the\r\nSecond Venetian and Genoese ships first began to carry their wares\r\nto England they cast anchor in its harbour,[525] and for two hundred\r\nyears Southampton became the centre of English traffic with the Italian\r\nrepublics.[526] An attempt to make it a free port in 1334 came to\r\na speedy end, but the advantages the scheme offered must have been\r\npractically secured by the privileges which the kings granted both\r\nto the foreign merchants who came to trade and to the town itself\r\nas a commercial centre. In 1337 the merchants of the Society of the\r\nAlberti in Florence did the carrying trade of wool from Southampton to\r\nGascony,[527] and three years later part of a tenement near the sea\r\nwas let to the Society of the Bardi, the Florentine bankers. In 1378\r\nthe King allowed merchants of Spain and the Genoese and Venetians who\r\ncarried all the Levant trade, to unlade and sell their goods at its\r\nwharfs instead of being forced to go to the staple at Calais;[528]\r\nand again in 1402 Henry the Fourth granted special permission to the\r\nGenoese to disembark at Southampton and carry their goods thence to\r\nLondon by land.[529] From 1353, when Winchester was made a staple\r\nfor wool, Southampton as the port from which alone all its bales\r\nmust be shipped to the Continent had a practical monopoly of the\r\nsouthern export trade.[530] It was the only harbour to which might be\r\ncarried “Malmseys and other sweet wines of the growth of Candye and\r\nRotymoes, and in any other place within the parts of Levant beyond\r\nthe Straits of Morocco.” Carracks from Genoa and Venice, ships from\r\nSpain, Portugal, Almayne, Flanders, and Zealand thronged its harbours,\r\nbringing their wines and spices, and carrying away wool for the weavers\r\nof the Netherlands, or cloth for the dyers of Italy and the traders\r\nof the Black Sea.[531] Attracted by its dazzling prospects of wealth,\r\nLondon vintners and cloth-workers rented great cellars for storage, and\r\nheld houses and lands in the town; and so brilliant was the promise of\r\nits future that in 1379 a Genoese merchant got leave from the king,\r\nfor the better security of his merchandise, to occupy the castle which\r\nhad just been rebuilt, and promised in return to make Southampton the\r\ngreatest port of Western Europe. But before he could carry out his\r\nplans the merchants in London, furious at so dangerous a rivalry, had\r\nhim assassinated at his own door.[532]\r\n\r\nNor was commercial enterprise left to the foreigner, for even in the\r\nfourteenth century native traders were sending out English ships to\r\ndo business in foreign ports.[533] In 1391 one merchant took a lease\r\nfor the whole year of the customs of the town by land and water; while\r\nanother wealthy burgess, William Soper, put the towers of the Water\r\nGate in repair at his own cost, and rented them and the adjoining\r\nbuildings for a hundred and twenty years, promising to repair and\r\nmaintain them. At the end of the fourteenth century the large sums\r\nwhich passed from hand to hand, and the numerous bonds for payment of\r\ndebts from £60 to £100 bore witness to the growth of trade.[534] The\r\nwool dues in the port were able to bear a charge of £100 a year granted\r\nby Henry the Fourth in 1400 for the repairing and fortifying of the\r\ntown walls; and in 1417 Cardinal Beaufort, Lord of Southampton and the\r\ngreatest wool-merchant in all England, lent £14,000 to Henry the Fifth\r\non security of customs on wool and other merchandise in the various\r\nports of Southampton, and before a third of it was repaid he advanced\r\nanother £14,000 on the same security.[535]\r\n\r\nThe prosperity of the citizens was shewn by their refusal any longer to\r\ninterrupt business during the Winchester fair. In 1350 they had already\r\nquarrelled with the bishop on the subject; but he had carried the day,\r\nand the town had again submitted to the old rules that while the fair\r\nlasted there should be no weighing and measuring at the great beam in\r\nthe market place, that if a merchant came carrying wares he should only\r\nbe allowed to remain if he swore that they were not intended for sale,\r\nand that the bishop’s bailiff should live in Southampton during the\r\nfair to see that the contract was carried out. If it was broken the\r\ninhabitants were bound, not only in their lands and houses but in all\r\ntheir goods and chattels, to pay a penalty of a thousand marks within\r\nthree months.[536] From this intolerable state of things the citizens\r\nwere strong enough to free themselves by negociations with the bishop\r\nin 1406,[537] and in 1433 they gained the right to have a fair of their\r\nown every year for three days at Trinity Chapel near the town.\r\n\r\nNor had the town yet exhausted its good fortune. A law of 1455 which\r\nforbade merchant strangers from Italy any longer to ride about the\r\ncountry buying up with ready money wools and wool cloth from the poor\r\npeople, and only allowed them henceforth to buy in London, Southampton,\r\nor Sandwich,[538] drove foreign traders to settle in the town if they\r\nwanted to carry on their business at all; and many more were added\r\nto their number the next year when the whole body of Italian dealers\r\nliving in London were driven out by a popular riot, and passing by\r\nWinchester, fixed their new homes in Southampton,[539] which must\r\nthen have contained within its walls the great majority of all the\r\nItalian merchants in England. The monopoly of the whole export trade of\r\nSouthern England was confirmed to the town by law in 1464; and finally\r\nHenry the Seventh created it a staple of metals, and gave the exclusive\r\nright of melting tin ore to its guild.[540]\r\n\r\nSmugglers and illegal traders bore their testimony to the profits\r\nto be made in Southampton waters. Light boats[541] pushed by night\r\ninto every creek and cove along the coast to land their casks of\r\nwine; and in the town strange tailors were hard at work cutting up\r\nstuff into garments for the foreign market so as to avoid the duty on\r\nexported cloth. It was decreed in 1407 that no alien tailor, coming\r\nin a ship or galley, should have any shop, house, or room in the town\r\nfor the making of any “robes, jepone, ne autres garnements” until\r\nhe had made agreement with the masters of the craft; so vessels of\r\n“Spayne, Portingall, Almayne, Flanders, Zelonde, and others in their\r\nvyages” came bringing with them “tailors of divers nations,” who now\r\nhowever simply abode in their ships and cut up the cloth there at\r\ntheir leisure, and in 1468, four years after the monopoly of the wool\r\ntrade had been again secured to Southampton, it had to pass a new\r\nlaw against these plunderers of the custom house.[542] Indeed, the\r\nmagnitude of commerce at the end of the century may be measured by the\r\nscale on which corruption and false dealing could be carried on even\r\nby the town authorities themselves. In 1484 two London citizens, one\r\na brewer, the other a “gentleman, and clerk of all the King’s ships,”\r\nowed to the mayor, sheriffs, and bailiffs of Southampton £1,200. These\r\nofficers, however, had apparently got into some difficulty about the\r\nsale of 1,086 sacks of wool in which they were concerned, and drew up\r\nan agreement with their debtors that they would forgive this debt of\r\n£1,200 if they might have a promise that they should be held “harmless\r\nin their own names, and not as mayor, sheriffs, and bailiffs.”[543]\r\n\r\nThere was, however, another aspect of Southampton trade. We have a\r\nglimpse of the hidden side of the town life during the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries in account books of the Hospital of St. Julian or\r\nGod’s House, which owned a hundred and eight tenements inhabited by\r\nworking people, the prosperous ones living in houses of their own, the\r\nmore luckless seeking shelter in selds or open warehouses. But from\r\nthe one class as from the other, the Hospital pressed in vain for a\r\nrent which the tenant scarcely ever paid. One of the richer kind is\r\npardoned 56_s._ arrears; the attorney is forgiven a sum of 50_s._; the\r\ngoldsmith who owes £4 8_s._ 6_d._, manages to pay most of his debt in\r\nsalt. Others pledge their carpets; some pay 1_d._ or 1/2_d._ or 3_d._\r\nat a time for large accounts against them; in other cases there is the\r\nbrief entry “died in poverty and so nothing;” or poor tenants “run away\r\nfrom the town in poverty,” and the selds that sheltered them stand\r\nempty. Such is the tale of misery—a misery scarcely alleviated by the\r\nalms distributed by the Hospital to the poor—in 1299 three bushels\r\nof wheat given in Advent; in 1306 one-and-a-half quarters of beans\r\nand twenty-nine quarters of peas; in 1318 thirteen quarters of beans.\r\nAfter the burning of a great part of the town in 1337 by a fleet of\r\nFrench, Spaniards, and Genoese, matters grew yet worse, and in 1340\r\nthe arrears amounted to four times as much as the yearly rents. The\r\nAbbot of Beaulieu owed five years’ rent for the “cheseseld.” There\r\nwas due from the five parishes of Holyrood, St. John, St. Michael,\r\nSt. Lawrence, and All Saints within the Bar, £127 in 1340, £155 in\r\n1342.[544] Large tenements were broken up into smaller ones where the\r\npeople huddled together in their misery, and the terrible legacy of a\r\nvery poor population clinging in extreme destitution to the slums and\r\nlow suburbs of the town was apparently handed on to the next century,\r\nfor so far as the published records tell, Southampton was the only town\r\nin the fifteenth century that gave regular out-door relief to paupers.\r\nIn 1441 the Steward’s book gives an account of £4 2_s._ 1_d._ given\r\naway in alms every week to poor men and women.[545]\r\n\r\nIn Southampton, in fact, riches did not gather in the people’s coffers\r\nwhile men slept. Wealth which was hard to win, was harder still to keep\r\nin the great port of the southern coast, where life and goods were\r\nheld by a precarious tenure whenever England had a quarrel across the\r\nwater. At any moment the plea of military necessity might justify all\r\nkinds of irregular and intermittent interference of royal officers,\r\nand the government of Southampton became a matter of divided authority\r\nand shifting responsibility which was probably unparalleled elsewhere\r\nin England. A special guardian of the king’s ships[546] interfered in\r\nthe harbour; and a receiver and victualler to the king’s troops[547]\r\ninterfered in the shops and market of the town. The Constable of the\r\nCastle[548] long survived the constables of other towns, and was given\r\npowers determined by the court view of the necessities of the times; so\r\nthat in 1369, we find a captain of the castle with authority to arrest\r\nall rebels against the king or the government of the town, and to watch\r\nagainst regrators, artizans, or workmen who should offend against the\r\nlaw.[549] At a time when the mayor of most boroughs was commissioner\r\nfor array-at-arms, the mayor was here jointly responsible for military\r\ndefences with the constable and apparently took quite the second\r\nplace.[550]\r\n\r\nMilitary discipline in fact pressed relentlessly at all points on a\r\nplace continually vexed by war and alarms of war and calls to arms. On\r\nSundays and holidays all children from seven years old were called out\r\nto practise shooting with bows on the common, while the town cowherd\r\nkept the cattle out of the way.[551] When war broke out every man had\r\nto go out and take his share of fighting, and no one save the mayor was\r\neven allowed to provide a deputy instead of bearing arms in person. If\r\nthe inhabitants had no heart to fight, summary punishment was meted out\r\nas a warning for future times; and when in 1338 the mayor, bailiffs,\r\nand burgesses fled before an attack of the French, the custody of\r\nSouthampton was seized into the king’s hands, and its franchises\r\nforfeited for a whole year.[552] Besides the cost of three or four\r\nships[553] to protect the harbour, with wages for masters and men, and\r\nmoney for their food and rent, Southampton was bound to have “ready for\r\ndefence against the foreign enemy great plenty of armour, weapons, and\r\nother artillery and things needful.” There was a town gunner who was\r\npaid sixpence a day to make gunpowder, gunstones and lathe-guns.[554]\r\nGeneration after generation of unwilling tradesmen had to repair and\r\nmaintain and defend walls over a mile long and from twenty-five to\r\nthirty feet high, with twenty-nine great towers; and to strengthen\r\nthe sea-banks and ditches. The work was divided out among the people;\r\nlightermen and boatmen were bound to bring up every year boatloads of\r\nstones and heap them up against the walls on the sea side, while the\r\ntownspeople put in piles and kept them in order.[555] The towers were\r\nmanned by the various crafts, one by shoemakers, curriers, cobblers,\r\nand saddlers; another by mercers and grocers; a third by goldsmiths,\r\nblacksmiths, lockyers, pewterers, and tinkers; and so on.[556] But so\r\nheavy was the cost of repairs, that after the burning of the town by\r\nthe French, when the king, in 1338 and 1340, ordered the fortifications\r\nto be strengthened and a stone wall fronting the sea built at the\r\nexpense of the inhabitants,[557] the people simply fled away; and the\r\nEarl of Warwick and his successors, under the title of “guardians of\r\nthe town,” were posted in its castle with men-at-arms and archers, “to\r\ntake order” about the wretched fugitives, and compel any inhabitants\r\nwho attempted to leave the town to return and live there “according\r\nto their estate,” and if they refused, to seize their houses, rents,\r\nand possessions for the king.[558] And in 1376 the poor commons and\r\ntenants prayed that the king would take the town into his hand and\r\nforgive them the rent, since for the last two years they had spent not\r\nonly the whole ferm which he had granted them (nearly £300 a year) on\r\nthe walls, but had been forced to give besides £1,000 of their own\r\nmoney, so that half the people had deserted their homes to escape the\r\nintolerable burdens thrown on them,[559] and the rest were going.\r\n\r\nThe long miseries of the Hundred Years War were soon followed by the\r\nharassing problems of the Wars of the Roses. For Southampton was\r\nreputed wealthy, with its unusually imposing ferm of £226 and the\r\nbig roll of the king’s customs, and there were always people waiting\r\nto dip their hands into so rich treasury. The royal generosities\r\nat its expense were an old story. A large part of the ferm was\r\nsettled on successive queens from the thirteenth to the seventeenth\r\ncenturies,[560] and however low funds might run the town always tried\r\nto keep well at court by paying at least the Queen’s jointure. Great\r\nnobles and servants of the king’s household were not forgotten, and\r\ntook their grants as they could get them, partly in money, partly\r\nin wine or foreign fruits or spices. But when two warring parties\r\neach claimed the treasure of Southampton as its own, the municipal\r\nfinances became a perilous matter for the council to deal with, and\r\nthe crises of the Wars of the Roses are marked by calamity to the town\r\nbudget.[561] In 1457 the ferm was only made up by contributions from\r\nseventeen burgesses amounting to over £42.[562] Matters were more\r\nserious in November, 1458, and the mayor had to go to London, from\r\nwhence he writes to entreat the auditors “that ye will, as diligently\r\nas ye can or may, with one heart, one will, and one thought effectually\r\nto labour, that an end be had of the books of the bailiffs in all\r\nhaste goodly, and to warn the steward that was to make his book ready\r\nagainst my coming home, for we must with all the diligence we can or\r\nmay make provision of money to be had in short time or we be like to be\r\nsore hurt, and that God defend for we have had too much.” One of the\r\nauditors accounts was over £30 too short, “the which is to me right\r\nstrange, so much money as he received the last year and this year too,\r\nI cannot understand it.... I remit it to your wisdoms.” Another account\r\nincluded nothing but the bare fees. These matters must be thought on\r\n“right specially” but “if ye will with good heart and will undivided\r\nand without any ambiguity every man heartily and diligently put his\r\nhand we shall once be brought out of thraldom.” As to political news\r\nhe is as cautious as he is anxious. “And so much to do will be amongst\r\nthem, God spede the right.” “I can no more, but I beseech God guide us\r\nin all our work.”[563] A few months after the mayor was summoned to the\r\nExchequer in London about his accounts, but before the day was fixed\r\nthe Lancastrian Lord Exeter suddenly sent his secretary to the town\r\nwith a receipt under his seal and sign manual for the last half-year’s\r\nrent. “Milord prayed us so fair to be paid here (that is in Southampton\r\nand not in London) and said he had never so great ‘myster’ ne need that\r\nhe is paid,” and promised his help in case of any difficulty in London,\r\n“for we told him what hurt and loss it was unto us.” So the town paid\r\nsadly, and the mayor anxiously wrote to their Recorder in London to\r\ntry and get them out of the scrape. “And [we will] make aready all the\r\nmoney that we may in all haste possible whatsomever befall,” he adds\r\nearnestly.[564]\r\n\r\nIt was indeed hard to gather money at the moment, for in 1460 the Earl\r\nof Wiltshire, Treasurer of Henry the Sixth, making an excuse to get to\r\nSouthampton under pretence of intercepting Warwick, found five great\r\ncarracks of Genoa lying in the port, seized them all with all their\r\nwealth, filled them with his soldiers, provided them with victuals from\r\nthe town without payment, and fled to Flanders with his booty.[565]\r\nThen came the new rulers, and Edward the Fourth ordered Southampton to\r\npay the treasurer of his household £133 6_s._ 8_d._, and to the Earl\r\nof Warwick as constable of Dover castle an annuity of £154 out of the\r\nsame ferm.[566] What with one trouble and another Southampton fell\r\ninto arrears with its rent, and a burgess (the very Richard Gryme who\r\nhad been mayor a year before and had made the advance to Lord Exeter)\r\nwas thrown into the Fleet in London till it should be paid; two of his\r\nfellow-townsmen were sent riding to Westminster “to labour for his\r\nwelfare,” and £20 was at last handed over before he was set free.[567]\r\nThe same year the sheriff, also summoned before the Exchequer, rode\r\nto London at the town’s cost; and he only got off by having his debt\r\npaid by the Recorder, who was afterwards repaid by the town.[568] There\r\nwas further trouble in 1469-70 when the Kingmaker, as the restored\r\nConstable of Dover under Henry the Sixth, demanded his pension from\r\nthe ferm, and the mayor travelled to London “to reckon with the Earl\r\nof Warwick,” and spent twelve days there, “for the which twelve days\r\nthe cost cometh to 50_s._ 6_d._”[569] Then a few months later came the\r\nother constable of the victorious Edward the Fourth, and the town had\r\nto pay him too and bear the double charge that year.[570]\r\n\r\nAll these financial difficulties were made yet more acute by the\r\ncharacter of the municipal wealth. Of the £393 which made up the\r\nrevenue of the town in 1428,[571] £302 3_s._ 4_d._ came from tolls;\r\nand the foreign commerce on which such sums were levied had to be\r\nmaintained amid wars with France, quarrels with Brittany, attacks of\r\nHanseatic and Breton and Genoese and Venetian traders always on the\r\nwatch to seize ships on any plea of wrong done to their merchants, or\r\nin defiance of pirates that swarmed in the Channel, and of smugglers\r\nthat haunted the coast. Again and again the people make complaint that\r\nthe foreign merchants that used to bring their goods no longer came,\r\nand for lack of tolls to pay the ferm the burgesses had been forced\r\nto borrow £400 for their rent, and that many citizens had been driven\r\nfrom the town, and others were going unless something could be done to\r\nlighten their burdens.[572]\r\n\r\nThese were some of the special problems with which Southampton had to\r\ndeal—perils of war, its consequences of military rule and divided\r\nauthority within the town, a complicated and difficult finance, a trade\r\nat once wealthy and precarious, heavy expenses to be met in good times\r\nand in bad, a very poor class living side by side with a very rich\r\none. The form of trouble might vary from year to year, but trouble\r\nwas always with them. Bargainings, abject petitionings and arbitrary\r\nfavours, concessions now on this side now on that, stern exactions and\r\nlavish gifts, left the town open to endless changes and chances of\r\nfortune.[573]\r\n\r\nThe general conditions, in fact, must have made the growth of popular\r\ngovernment practically impossible; and from the beginning the town\r\nwas probably ruled by a narrow oligarchy. Its first constitution was,\r\nperhaps, framed under the influence of a powerful Merchant Guild,\r\nsuch as would naturally be formed in a wealthy commercial centre—a\r\nfraternity not unlike the contemporary guild at Lynn or the latter\r\none at Coventry.[574] It seems that in the twelfth century two king’s\r\nbailiffs had the care of all the royal property, the collection of\r\nthe ferm, the gathering in of the king’s debts, and so forth.[575]\r\nMeanwhile the Merchant Guild elected its own aldermen, scavins, usher,\r\nand other officers, to protect the liberties and customs granted\r\nto it by Henry the First and confirmed by Henry the Second and his\r\nsons.[576] In 1199 John granted to “the burgesses” to have their\r\ntown at ferm,[577] and it is probable that the alderman of the guild\r\nwas charged with the collection and payment of the money, for in the\r\ncourse of the next generation he appears as mayor of the town.[578]\r\nBoth offices, mayor and alderman, were carried on side by side in his\r\nperson. He shared the government with the bailiffs, as chief of the\r\ntown and the guild, bound to maintain the statutes of both, and having\r\nthe first voice in all elections concerning both. If the bailiffs\r\nfailed to do justice, he summoned the jurors and judged in their place.\r\nHe had charge of the common coffer and the keys of the town gates,\r\nand kept the assize of bread and of ale.[579] By virtue of his old\r\ntitle and office the mayor was still called alderman in the fourteenth\r\ncentury,[580] and in 1368 he apparently acted at the head of the guild\r\norganization with its four scavins.[581]\r\n\r\nThe peculiar position of an alderman of the guild thus turned into a\r\nmayor, is no doubt marked by the fact that he was never, as in other\r\nboroughs, the elect of the whole community, nor even of a jury chosen\r\nby the people. In the fifteenth century it was admitted that from time\r\nimmemorial the custom was for the outgoing mayor, in the presence of\r\nthe bailiffs and burgesses, to nominate two burgesses, and the assembly\r\nwas forced to elect one of these two, unless they chose to re-elect the\r\nmayor himself, which indeed was often done. The system was probably\r\nthat which the guild had originally adopted for choosing its aldermen,\r\nand which went on unchanged under the new circumstances. His place as\r\nmayor, indeed, seems to have been an honour slowly and reluctantly\r\nconceded,[582] for in 1249, after “Benedict the son of Aaron” had held\r\noffice (possibly for eleven years) the burgesses obtained a royal\r\npatent granting that neither they nor their heirs should ever again\r\nhave a mayor in Southampton.[583] Twelve years later, however, the list\r\nbegins again, though in a manner as informal as before, for long after\r\nhis authority in Southampton was undisputed, the mayor was officially\r\nignored in that capacity at Westminster, and charters from the time\r\nof Henry the Second to that of Richard the Second were addressed to\r\n“the burgesses.”[584] It was only after a charter of Henry the Fourth,\r\nwhich among other things appointed the mayor and four aldermen as\r\njustices of the peace,[585] that the style seems to have changed, and\r\nthe letters patent of Henry the Fifth are addressed to “the mayor and\r\nburgesses.”[586] At last, in 1445, under Henry the Sixth, Southampton\r\nwas made a perpetual corporation to be known by the name of “mayor,\r\nbailiffs, and burgesses,”[587] and this phrase henceforth replaced the\r\nold style.[588]\r\n\r\nWith the group of officials through whom the alderman ruled the guild\r\nwe have no immediate concern. But when the mayor had taken his oath of\r\noffice in S. Michael’s Church (perhaps in the north chancel aisle which\r\nwas called “Corporation Chapel”), he found himself at the head of an\r\nadministrative body of twelve “discreets” and twelve aldermen of the\r\nwards. The aldermen set over the five wards (three of which were ruled\r\nby two aldermen, and the remaining two by three, making twelve in all)\r\nacted as a kind of police to keep the peace in their respective wards,\r\nto enroll the names of all the inhabitants and of their sureties, to\r\ntake up malefactors, and to make the round every week or fortnight\r\nto see that all was in good order;[589] and it is possible that they\r\ntook part in some work of the mayor’s council in the fourteenth\r\ncentury.[590] The twelve “discreets” were elected every year by the\r\nwhole community in an appointed place, and like the twelve portmen of\r\nIpswich were sworn to keep the peace, to preserve the town liberties,\r\nto do justice to poor and rich, and to be present at every court.[591]\r\nThey had joint charge with the mayor of the treasure and the common\r\nchest of charters and deeds, and no document could be sealed with the\r\ncommon seal unless at least six of them were present. They themselves\r\nelected the two bailiffs, the common clerk, and the serjeant of the\r\ntown.[592] Finally in 1401, two years after the same privilege had been\r\nconceded to Nottingham, the charter of Henry IV. gave the discreets\r\npower to choose out of their own body four aldermen, who together with\r\nthe mayor were to be justices of the peace, and were to be aided in\r\ntheir work by four discreet persons chosen by the mayor and community.\r\nFrom this time doubtless the mayor and his four brethren became the\r\nchief aldermen of the five wards;[593] and the town council, as in\r\nNottingham, elected some of its members to sit as aldermen in scarlet\r\nrobes, and some to be plain “discreets” or “burgesses.”[594]\r\n\r\nThe two charters which finally determined the constitution of\r\nSouthampton were granted within a year of the similar charters to\r\nNottingham. The first, in 1445, which formed a deed of incorporation\r\nunder the title of mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, recognized elections\r\nby the official body, a custom which appears in the charter of 1401;\r\nwhile the second made the town into a county, in order to protect the\r\nmerchants and mariners who were incommoded by the sheriff of the county\r\nserving writs on them.[595] In the actual government of the place\r\nit does not seem that these charters brought about much change. The\r\nmayor still presided over meetings of aldermen and burgesses at the\r\nGuildhall in Bargate Tower,[596] or in the Audit House which stood in\r\nthe middle of the street in the very centre of the fish, poultry, and\r\npig markets; and the whole community might be gathered together for\r\nthe common business at the discretion of the rulers.[597] Nor did the\r\ncharter of incorporation alter the old style used in local business.\r\nIn affairs that concerned the commonalty, whether it was an agreement\r\nwith some other borough about tolls, or ordinances for the town, or a\r\nconcord with a neighbour as to the limits of the town’s jurisdiction,\r\nor the leasing of the customs by land and sea for a year, or grants\r\nof land—in all such matters the ancient custom was to use the name\r\nof the “mayor and community”; and even after 1445 the old form “mayor\r\nand community” is still retained in all acts that related to public\r\nproperty and the town treasure, all leases, water supply, fines due\r\nto the Queen, license to hold a fair, and the like.[598] That the\r\ndistinction between burgesses and commonalty was a real one in the eyes\r\nof the people is proved by the fact that on three great occasions when\r\na solemn consent of the whole town was required, the signature of “the\r\ncommonalty” or “the whole community” was formally placed alongside\r\nof that of the official class—once in the treaty with the Archduke\r\nPhilip in 1496; once in the treaty with Maximilian as to the marriage\r\nof Prince Charles of Spain to Henry’s daughter the Lady Mary; and once\r\nagain in an important transaction concerning the common lands of the\r\ntown.[599]\r\n\r\nIt thus seems probable that administration in Southampton underwent\r\nsingularly little change from first to last, save the raising of\r\ncouncillors into self-elected aldermen and justices of the peace.\r\nWhether the system of close election by the council recognized in the\r\ncharters of 1401 and 1445 was new, or whether, as is equally probable,\r\nthe custom was already of old standing, it seems plain that no popular\r\ndisturbance or protest was excited by these charters. It was not till\r\nfifteen years later, in 1460, that the commons rose in open revolt\r\nunder the leadership of the sheriff and five burgesses, and then the\r\nbattle raged round the election of the mayor.[600] A hundred or more\r\nrioters rushed to the Guildhall, broke in upon the meeting there with\r\ndrawn daggers and loud cries, and proceeding at once to elect their\r\nleader the sheriff as mayor, carried him in triumph on their shoulders,\r\nand set him on the mayor’s seat, while another of the ringleaders was\r\nappointed in his place as sheriff. But the riot had no great results.\r\nThe defeated party procured a patent which declared that their old\r\ncustom of election was to be observed, and a mayor was lawfully\r\nchosen by it; but as they were unable to displace the usurper, the\r\nquarrel finally ended in a compromise whose only effect was slightly\r\nto increase the part taken by the aldermen in elections. By this new\r\nsystem the mayor and aldermen met in the audit house a month before\r\nthe day of election, and chose four burgesses for nomination; on the\r\nday of election they again met and struck two names off the list. The\r\nremaining two names were proposed to the burgesses and one of them\r\nelected by ballot; the outgoing mayor let it be known which was to be\r\nelected, and the ballot was a matter of form. The people put their\r\nnecks once more under the yoke, and the mayor nominated his successor\r\nand handed on to him the traditions of office which he had himself\r\nreceived.[601]\r\n\r\nTwenty years later there seems to have been another impotent effort\r\nto reform the system of election. At this time all such attempts were\r\nwatched from the Court with suspicious fear; and Richard the Third\r\nwrote to the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, pointing out that by\r\ntheir letters patent they had truly the right both to elect municipal\r\nofficers and to remove them for reasonable cause, and directing them,\r\nsince “certain indisposed persons are about to trouble and vex you\r\nin due execution of the said grant, so to punish the said indisposed\r\npersons as shall be the good and fearful example of others, and if they\r\nbe such persons whom ye may not accordingly punish in that behalf, to\r\ncertify us thereof to the intent we may provide such a lawful remedy in\r\nthe same as may accord with your said privileges.”[602]\r\n\r\nIn these dissensions it does not seem that the popular anger was\r\nexcited by alleged political usurpations, but simply by corrupt\r\nadministration, especially perhaps in relation to public money and the\r\ncommon lands. There was certainly financial trouble. In 1459, as we\r\nhave seen, the auditor’s accounts had fallen short by large sums; and\r\nas from of old one of the auditors was appointed by the mayor, and\r\nthe treasure chest was kept in the mayor’s house and the keys by the\r\nmayor and discreets, there was probably ground for suspicion on the\r\npart of the people.[603] The remedy, however, was slowly and hardly\r\nwon, and it was not till 1505 that a very moderate reform was carried\r\nout by passing a decree that the mayor’s salary should be paid through\r\nthe steward by the auditors; “to the intent following that no mayor\r\nfrom this day forward take upon him to receive or handle any of the\r\ntown’s money, that is, to wit, he shall make no fine except it be at\r\nthe audit house, calling to him two or three of the aldermen or of the\r\ndiscreets at the least, and the money thereof coming to be put into the\r\nCommon Box in the said audit house.”[604] In course of time it was also\r\nordered that the common chest should be kept in the guild hall[605]\r\ninstead of the mayor’s own house.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, 1459, there was probably some alarm also as to the\r\ncommon lands.[606] The 376 acres of Southampton Common, the various\r\ncloses, the God’s House Meadow, and the Saltmarsh, were, as we have\r\nseen, the special care of the “community”;[607] and a quarrel had been\r\ngoing on for centuries with S. Julian’s Hospital as to a tract of\r\nmarsh which was claimed by the town as part of its common in spite of\r\nall the fences raised by the warden of S. Julian’s to vindicate his\r\nclaims.[608] In 1459 a new warden perhaps suggested the plan which he\r\ncarried out a few years later, after the failure of the popular revolt,\r\nwhen he disseised the town in 1466 of a part of the great marsh or\r\ncommon, having bought over the mayor by a grant of some of the land in\r\nquestion to be held of the hospital. Under a later mayor in 1471 the\r\nburghers again broke down the fences put up by the hospital,[609] and\r\nappealed to the king and council to defend their ancient privileges.\r\n“Ancient men” (one aged 104 and more) gave their depositions as to\r\nboundaries,[610] and an award was finally made in 1504, followed by\r\nthe necessary legal settlements, in 1505. A new quarrel arose when\r\nthe corporation attempted to raise a tax for keeping up the sea-banks\r\nor cutting sluices to save the fields from floods; and proposed, if\r\nthis failed, to enclose and hire out a part of the common land to\r\npay these expenses.[611] The townsmen, on the alert for danger, sent\r\nin eager declarations that the poor commons “will be ever ready to\r\nwithstand all manner of persons with their bodies and goods that\r\nwould attempt to usurp upon any point or parcel of the liberties and\r\nfranchises of the town.” They would not hear of letting any part of\r\nthe common; as to paying any money for sluice, bridge, or cut made\r\nby the corporation, “they pray your wisdoms in that matter to assess\r\nnone of them, for they intend to pay none in no wise”; unless indeed\r\nsome better and happier times might befall them, “remembering your\r\npoor commons are not as yet at a fordele in riches, trusting to God to\r\nincrease under your masterships.”[612] The period of wealth, however,\r\ntarried, and so did the taxes; so a few years later the corporation\r\nordered part of the marsh to be enclosed. Upon this three hundred\r\nof the commons, men and women, marched out to the waste, broke down\r\nfences and banks, and triumphantly proceeded to the guild hall, making\r\n“presumptuously and unlawfully a great shout” to the annoyance of\r\nthe court within. Flushed with success they next walked two and two\r\nin procession with their picks and shovels to the mayor’s house near\r\nHoly Rood Church and Cross, and one cried out, “If master mayor have\r\nany more work for us we be ready”; after which they went home without\r\ndoing further harm. Four days later one of the king’s council came\r\ndown with letters ordering the arrest of the chief offenders, and\r\nperpetual banishment was proclaimed against the ringleaders who had\r\nfled, while six other men were seized, taken to London, and put in\r\nthe Marshalsea. The Southampton rioters were struck with terror and\r\nrepentance. Petitions were got up in every parish for the prisoners;\r\nthe town promised to restore the banks, and never sin again in like\r\nfashion; the corporation sent out a proclamation that all those who\r\nhad taken part in breaking down the banks should go out to build them\r\nup again, and only when this was done was the petition for mercy\r\nforwarded to London. Finally, sentence was given by the cardinal and\r\nthe council that the prisoners should be sent home, and at their coming\r\nto Hampton should sit in the open stocks under the pillory, till the\r\nmayor and his brethren and the king’s lieutenant walked down the\r\nstreet, when the penitents were to plead for mercy and forgiveness and\r\nconfess their guilt. All this was done; the mayor, in the name of his\r\nbrethren, magnanimously, of his great mercy, accepted the apology and\r\npromised that no grudge should be borne against them. “And thereupponne\r\n[he] commaunded them owt of the stokkes, and hadd them to the audite\r\nhous, and bound them by obligacon to be good aberying ageynst the\r\nkinges grace and the mayor and his brethryn hereafter, and so delyveryd\r\nthem.”[613] The municipal dignity was vindicated, though the quarrel\r\nwas still left to drag on for the next two hundred years.[614]\r\n\r\nIn spite of irritation over questions of financial fraud and the\r\nmanagement of the common lands, however, there seems to have been\r\nlittle political activity in Southampton. The civic life stretches\r\nout before us like stagnant waters girt round by immutable barriers.\r\nScarcely a movement disturbs its sluggish surface. The twelve\r\nperpetually gather round the mayor and rule the town with a despotic\r\npower which hardly suffers change during the centuries from John to\r\nHenry the Eighth. Even the modest claim of townsfolk for some closer\r\nconnexion with their mayor only reveals with what a steady hand the\r\nvenerable oligarchy maintained its ancient discipline. Against their\r\nconsecrated order the commons from time to time made a riotous and\r\ndisorderly protest;[615] but there is no attempt to bring about real\r\nconstitutional reform. We scarcely hear of the general Assembly; there\r\nis no appeal to old traditions of freedom; no talk of a representative\r\ncouncil of the commons; no organized resistance of the crafts—possibly\r\nbecause these, however numerous, were too poor and weak (if we may\r\njudge from their inability to maintain the walls and towers, even when\r\ngrouped together) to make head against a very powerful corporation.\r\nMere outbreaks of unorganized and intermittent revolt, which were\r\noccasionally kindled by some grave scandal, died away fruitlessly\r\nbefore the steady resistance of the authorities in power, and such\r\nparoxysms of transient activity on the part of the people remained\r\nwithout permanent result.\r\n\r\nSouthampton had, in fact, a peculiar history and a fixed tradition in\r\ngovernment, which left its people in a singularly helpless position\r\nbefore authority. The conditions, political and commercial, of\r\nits municipal life necessarily gave the expert a supreme place in\r\nadministration; and it is possible that a compact body of merchants\r\nhad from the first imposed their methods of government and election on\r\na population who had no voice in the matter. The state of affairs was\r\nexactly reflected in the attitude of the mayor, who held a place of\r\nsingular pre-eminence and might. Far removed from popular criticism or\r\ncontrol, as direct minister of the king[616] he conducted a vast mass\r\nof business in absolute independence, both of the community and of the\r\nguild, not only as being the king’s escheator, the gauger and weigher\r\nof goods at the king’s standard, and measurer over the assize of cloth,\r\nthe mayor of the staple of wool, and mayor of the staple of metals\r\nunder the king’s orders, but also as the king’s admiral within the town\r\nand its liberties, with supreme control of the port and coast from\r\nChrist Church Head to the Needles thence to Hill Head at the mouth of\r\nSouthampton Water, over the port of Cowes and of Portsmouth;[617] and\r\neven as a sort of secretary for foreign affairs, for we must remember\r\nthat nowhere, save in London, was the “foreign” question so big and\r\nimportant. Settlers from France or the Netherlands, such as those\r\nin Sandwich or Norwich, who took up their dwelling there and became\r\nabsorbed in the general body of the townsfolk, formed a very different\r\nclass from the merchant visitors who flocked to Southampton to look\r\nafter business interests which extended all over the country, and to a\r\ngreat extent conducted the whole carrying trade of the south; and who,\r\nas strangers under the peculiar protection of the king, constituted\r\na foreign colony, ruled by special laws and kept under special\r\nsupervision.[618] In all these different departments of his government\r\nthe mayor ruled by other laws than the municipal ordinances; he did\r\nnot need the municipal seal for his decrees, nor the assent of the\r\ncommunity for his acts; and the great departments in which his actions\r\nwere removed from all possibility of local criticism, and local control\r\nmust have made absolute rule the easier and less singular in all other\r\nrelations of his office.\r\n\r\nNor ought we to forget wholly the outer influences which were acting\r\non Southampton from the world beyond the water. With Flanders it seems\r\nto have had little direct communication. So long as the Mediterranean\r\ngalleys carried its wool to the Netherland ports, and returned to\r\npick up their freight for the homeward journey, the associations and\r\ncommerce of Southampton were with the great cities of Italy, too far\r\nremoved from it in every conceivable respect to serve as schools of\r\npolitical freedom; and with the communes of France whose liberties\r\nhad long suffered decay, and in the fifteenth century were finally\r\nextinguished by the policy of Louis the Eleventh, the subtle enemy of\r\npopular liberties.[619] It is hard to tell how far Southampton may have\r\nbeen affected by such foreign associations, but at least they did not\r\ntend to weaken the influences at home which made for oligarchic rule.\r\nUndoubtedly if we compare this town with other English boroughs where\r\ncivic life was more free and expansive in its growth, the municipal\r\nrecord, in spite of its brilliant commercial side, is one of singular\r\nmonotony, and leaves us with the sense of a stunted developement in the\r\nbody politic. Southampton, in fact, was by its position and dignity\r\ncalled to play so great a part in the national history, both in war\r\nand commerce, that all claim to private and local independence was\r\nsuperseded. At a far earlier date than other towns its destiny was\r\nmerged in the fortunes of the whole commonwealth,[620] and the king\r\nsuffered no deviation from the service required of it to the state. In\r\na very remarkable way Southampton anticipated the history of boroughs\r\nwhich under the Tudors were drawn into the same duty and service;\r\nthrough successive centuries its burghers acquiesced in the expert\r\nadministration of a small official class, scarcely fettered by popular\r\ncontrol; and abandoned the pursuit of new ideals of communal life or\r\nnew experiments in government.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE COUNCIL OF NOTTINGHAM\r\n\r\n\r\nPROBLEMS of government sat lightly on the people of Nottingham.\r\nSingularly favoured as it was by fortune compared with many other\r\ntowns, there is something phenomenal in the record of a town so\r\ntranquil, so uniformly prosperous, so exempt from apprehension, with\r\nso complacent a record of successful trading and undisturbed ease.\r\nAdministration was carried on in its simplest form, and few sacrifices\r\nwere demanded of the inhabitants, whether of labour or of money,\r\ncompared with the efforts which were required of less fortunate towns.\r\nThe interest, in fact, of its history lies in the quiet picture that is\r\ngiven of a group of active and thriving traders, at peace with their\r\nneighbours, and for the most part at peace with themselves.\r\n\r\nThe position of Nottingham was one of great military importance; for\r\nlying almost at the centre of the kingdom, the town held the approach\r\nto the one bridge over the Trent by which the main road from the south\r\nstruck northward: and further commanded the navigation of the river\r\nfrom the point where, broadened by the confluence of the Derwent\r\nand the Soar, it became a great highway of internal communication.\r\nThroughout its history, therefore, from the time of the Danes down to\r\nthe time of the Civil War, Nottingham could not be left out of account\r\nwhen any fighting was going on. But England was in the main a land of\r\npeace, and the occasional and intermittent importance of an internal\r\nfortress was wholly different from the consequence that attached to\r\na border castle like that of Bristol, or to outposts against foreign\r\nfoes such as the walled seaport towns of the coast. Hence the military\r\nadvantages of its site made but little mark on the character and\r\nhistory of the town, and the castle which crowned the sandstone cliff\r\nthat rose precipitously from the waters of the river Lene played no\r\ngreat part in the life of the mediæval borough. Lying well out of reach\r\nof all foreign foes, it fell into no misfortunes such as Rye, which\r\nwas destroyed by fire twice in half a century, nor was it impoverished\r\nby taxes for defence against the French such as threatened to leave\r\nSouthampton desolate; and its merchants were only occasionally required\r\nto make contribution towards the protection of the coast and the safety\r\nof the sea-borne trade which added to their wealth and luxury. Thus,\r\nwhen the keeping of the sea was given in 1406 to the English merchants,\r\ntheir elected Admiral of the Fleet, Nicholas Blackburn, wrote a\r\nperemptory order to Nottingham for £200 as its share of the cost;[621]\r\nbut the merchants’ experiment failed, and they were relieved of their\r\nresponsibility before they had levied any second toll.\r\n\r\nBut the same geographical position which, under other circumstances,\r\nwould have made of Nottingham a strategic centre, did under the actual\r\nconditions of English life assure the fortunes of the borough in\r\nindustry and commerce. By land and by water, trade was almost forced\r\nto its gates. The bridge which spanned the Trent, after it had fallen\r\ninto ruins as the property of the kings, was granted by Edward the\r\nThird to the townspeople, who willingly undertook the heavy charges\r\nof its repair and maintenance; each division of the town territory\r\nwas made responsible for one or two of its nineteen low arches,[622]\r\nand the wardens appointed to oversee the whole appeared from time\r\nto time before the municipal officers with laborious and portentous\r\naccounts. Over this bridge all traffic from south to north was bound\r\nto pass; while boats from Hull and the eastern ports travelled up the\r\nriver to unload at the quays of Nottingham. Thus the burghers, more\r\nfortunate than those of Canterbury, Norwich, or Shrewsbury, had no\r\ncause to fear the troubles of a shifting commerce, of manufacturers\r\ndriven away to seek for brighter prospects, or of merchants forsaking\r\nthe old ways for some new trade route. A uniform prosperity seems to\r\nhave reigned in the town. Traders of every kind were in 1395 winning\r\nmore than the law allowed them,[623] and the market-place, which is\r\nsaid even now to be the largest in England, was covered with booths;\r\nthere were twenty fish-boards, thirty-two stalls in the Butchers’\r\nHouse, thirty in the Mercers’ House, twenty in the Drapers’ House,\r\nand so on, the rents of which were rapidly rising in the second half\r\nof the fifteenth century;[624] and the stately Guild Hall, besides its\r\ncouncil room, and its upper prison for felons and gaols for debtors\r\nwith iron grating to the street, had its storage room for merchandise.\r\nBuyers and sellers crowded to the market, for new burgesses were still\r\nwillingly admitted[625] on the payment of 6_s._ 8_d._, and it was only\r\nat the close of the next century that the ready hospitality of the town\r\ngave way to a jealous exclusiveness. Strangers without number paid\r\nfor license to trade, besides rents for stalls or shops;[626] and the\r\nnumber of suits between burgesses and “foreigners” or non-burgesses,\r\nwas so great that sometimes in a single year twenty rolls or more were\r\nclosely written on both sides with the records of these suits alone—a\r\nfact which points to trade dealings with the outer world on a scale\r\nquite unknown to previous times.[627] Even the geological position\r\nof the town added to its sources of wealth, and the corporation as\r\nwell as traders made profit from the neighbouring coal-mines.[628]\r\nAll kinds of industries seem to have flourished. As early as 1155,\r\nwhen probably there were few places in England where cloth was dyed,\r\nbales were sent to Nottingham to be coloured red, blue, green, and\r\ntawny or murrey; and if their scarlet dye was liable to turn out not\r\nscarlet but red[629] even in 1434, we must remember that at this time\r\nfor a fine scarlet dye English cloth had to be sent to Italy.[630]\r\nNottingham manufacturers made linen as well as woollen goods.[631] Its\r\nfamous workers in iron lived in Girdler Gate and Bridlesmith Gate.\r\nThere was a foundry for bells well known in all the neighbouring\r\ncounties, and the bell-founder, besides his bells, made brazen pots.\r\nMoreover, there were artists of repute.[632] Among English churches\r\nof the early Perpendicular period, there is none more beautiful than\r\nS. Mary’s, lifted high above the market on the steep hill side.[633]\r\nThe Nottingham goldsmith was sent for to repair the cross in Clifton\r\nChurch.[634] The town had its own illuminator, Richard the Writer; and\r\nits image-maker, Nicolas Hill, who sent his wares as far as London (on\r\none occasion as many as fifty-eight heads of John the Baptist, some of\r\nthem in tabernacles or niches) and as he worked also in painting or\r\ngilding alabaster salt-cellars, was commonly known as the “Alablaster\r\nMan.”[635]\r\n\r\nThe wealth of Nottingham was possibly not equal to that of towns like\r\nBristol or Lynn, where at a time when capital was scanty the burghers\r\nhad accumulated in their coffers good store of gold and silver. But\r\na general air of substantial comfort and well-being seems to have\r\npervaded the town. The subsidy roll of 1472 which gives a list of 154\r\nowners of freehold property, from one whose tenth was 74_s._ 7-1/2_d._\r\ndown to one whose tenth was set down at 1/4_d._,[636] the inventories\r\nof household goods, and the legacies which occur from time to time,\r\nshow a considerable class of citizens living in wealth and luxury, and\r\na yet larger class of comparatively well-to-do people after the measure\r\nof those times. While the richer merchants were building or adorning\r\nwith handsome carved oak houses which a later age called “palaces of\r\nKing John,” humbler tradesmen contented themselves with homes such\r\nas are described in a builder’s contract of 1479, where the little\r\ndwelling with a frontage of 18 feet on the street, was to have two bay\r\nwindows and to cost altogether about £6.[637] Before the latter part of\r\nthe sixteenth century[638] at least there is no indication of poverty\r\nsuch as we find in various other towns, in Southampton, or Romney, or\r\nChester, or Canterbury—all places which had to suffer from special\r\ncauses of distress—and even the wills do not contain the frequent\r\nbequests for the relief of the poor and of prisoners which occur in\r\nplaces where the calls of distress were more pressing and insistent.\r\nThe financial problems of the corporation were perfectly simple and\r\nregular, and presented no more formidable difficulty than the keeping\r\nin repair of the great bridge. When the ferm of the town was reduced\r\nto £20 by Edward the Fourth it was done, so far as the municipal\r\nrecords tell the tale,[639] without any of the complainings of utter\r\nmisery and desolation by which such favours were commonly won; and in\r\nthe next half century there is no more serious hint of distress than is\r\nmarked by the fact that in 1499 two of the butchers’ stalls and a few\r\nother holdings were lying vacant, and that the Corporation had borrowed\r\nsome small sums.[640]\r\n\r\nNottingham was unfretted too by trouble from without. Set on the\r\noutskirts of Sherwood Forest, but exempted since the time of John from\r\nthe Forest laws and the jurisdiction of the Forest officers,[641] its\r\nvery position tended to free it from the neighbourhood of any powerful\r\nlord who could threaten its citizens, diminish its rights, or tax its\r\npeople with petty wars or law-suits, as Liverpool and Bristol and Lynn\r\nwere taxed and harassed. In its only trouble—an occasional dispute as\r\nto the control of the waters of the Trent—it was invariably supported\r\nby the Crown. Sometimes weirs and fishing nets obstructed the river;\r\nsometimes when the water was low boats coming from Hull had to be\r\ndragged along from the banks, and the river-side owners demanded fines\r\nfor use of the towing path, so that the price of goods in Nottingham\r\nwas increased to “a great dearness.” Then the Nottingham men would\r\nhasten to move the king by “a clamorous relation”; and forthwith royal\r\ncommissioners were sent down to inquire into the obstructions; royal\r\nproclamations were issued to forbid the exacting of river-side tolls;\r\nand royal orders forbade the neighbouring lord of Colwick to divert the\r\nwaters of the Trent to his own uses to the injury of Nottingham.[642]\r\n\r\nNor were its burghers troubled by claims of any ecclesiastical power\r\nwithin the town walls, such as those which vexed Norwich and Exeter\r\nand Canterbury. Ecclesiastical interests indeed play no great part\r\nin Nottingham. Two churches already existed under Cnut, and before\r\nthe fourteenth century one more was added.[643] But no abbey had been\r\nfounded within its liberties, and the yearly journey of the mayor\r\nand his brethren to carry Whitsuntide offerings to the mother church\r\nat Southwell was but a picturesque ceremonial that recalled the time\r\nwhen Paulinus first founded there a centre of mission work among the\r\npagans.[644]\r\n\r\nAs for Court factions and dynastic intrigues, distant traders with\r\nmuch work of their own on hands were generally prompted by a prudent\r\nself-interest to side with the dominant power in the State. The\r\nburghers easily transferred their sympathies from the Lady Anne of\r\nBohemia to Henry the Fourth;[645] they stood by Henry the Sixth so\r\nlong as the triumph of the rebels was doubtful, but no sooner were the\r\nfortunes of Edward the Fourth in the ascendant than by gifts out of\r\ntheir treasure and little detachments of their militia they testified\r\nto a new loyalty, and thus obtained the renewal of their charter and\r\na reduction of their ferm for twenty years, “to have a reward to the\r\ntown of Nottingham” “for the great cost and burdens, and loss of their\r\ngoods that they have sustained by reason of those services.”[646] In\r\n1464 they ordered off a little troop in red jackets with white letters\r\nsewn on them[647] to join the king at York, and once more at Edward’s\r\nrestoration in 1471,[648] the town spent about £60 for “loans for\r\nsoldiers” and liveries, besides many other costs. In October of 1482,\r\nthe jury “presented” an offender charged with wearing the livery of\r\nthe intriguing Richard of Gloucester;[649] but before the battle of\r\nBosworth the town hospitably entertained Richard himself, and in its\r\ncastle he received the Great Seal;[650] while no sooner was the day\r\nlost for York than a deputation was sent in hot haste to make peace\r\nwith Henry the Seventh and obtain a safeguard and proclamation.[651]\r\nStall-holders and burghers, in fact, intent on their own business, only\r\nasked that Court quarrels might be settled with the least possible\r\ntrouble to themselves; and throughout the Wars of the Roses the\r\nNottingham men did just what the men of every other town in England\r\ndid—reluctantly sent their soldiers when they were ordered out to the\r\naid of the reigning king, and whatever might be the side on which they\r\nfought, as soon as victory was declared hurried off their messengers\r\nwith gifts and protestations of loyalty to the conqueror. Meanwhile\r\nthey went steadily on with the main business of trade and watched the\r\nrents of their booths and the profits of their shops going up and their\r\nwealth constantly accumulating.[652]\r\n\r\nLike all boroughs that held under the Crown, Nottingham won very\r\nearly the rights of a free borough. Henry the Second from 1155 to\r\n1165 granted its burgesses freedom from toll, a market, the monopoly\r\nof working dyed cloth within the borough, and free passage along the\r\nTrent; and further gave them power to tax inhabitants of all fees\r\nwhatever for common expenses.[653] Originally governed by a reeve who\r\ncollected its yearly ferm and managed its affairs on behalf of the\r\nking, Nottingham obtained by charter from John in 1189 a Merchant\r\nGuild, and leave to elect a reeve of the borough who should answer for\r\nthe ferm to the Exchequer.[654] In 1230 the burgesses were allowed to\r\nappoint coroners, and (the ferm being fixed at £52) to levy a tax for\r\nweighing at the common scale all goods brought to the town.[655] A\r\ncharter of 1255 granted them the freedom from arrest for debt which was\r\nbeing so commonly given at this time; the return of writs; and an order\r\nthat no sheriff or bailiff should interfere in the exercise of justice\r\nin Nottingham unless “the burgesses” had not done their duty. And ten\r\nyears later they were freed from the aid of 100_s._ formerly paid\r\nto the sheriff for his good will and that he should not enter their\r\nliberties.[656]\r\n\r\nIn the reverses of the Welsh war, when Edward the First summoned two\r\ngreat provincial councils of knights and burgesses to bestow a grant\r\nfor completing the conquest of Wales, Nottingham used his necessities\r\nto secure its own profit; for three years the town had been in\r\ndisgrace, with all its franchises forfeited, but in 1284 it not only\r\nregained them, but won permission to elect a mayor “by unanimous\r\nconsent and will” of “both boroughs of the same town”—that is the\r\nFrench and the English boroughs which from the time of the Conquest had\r\nbeen established side by side, each governed by its own bailiff[657]\r\naccording to the different laws and customs of the two peoples. During\r\nthe Scotch war in 1314 their position as masters of the northern road\r\npossibly disposed Edward the Second to grant readily any favours they\r\nmight demand; and immediately after Bannockburn they received power\r\nto hold all pleas before the mayor, and alien sheriffs or bailiffs\r\nwere forbidden to enter the borough.[658] Yet later one of the first\r\nacts of Henry of Lancaster, after the deposition of Richard in 1399,\r\nwas to make interest with the keepers of the stronghold of middle\r\nEngland. He gave lavishly all he had to give: the assize of tenure\r\nformerly held before the judges; all fines, forfeitures, and ransoms\r\nwhich had not yet been handed over; the election of four justices of\r\nthe peace; the placing of the mayor upon all commissions of array of\r\nmen-at-arms, so that neither sheriff of the county, nor officer of\r\nthe court could henceforth tax the town for military aid without his\r\nassistance and consent.[659] In 1448 Henry the Sixth completed the\r\nemancipation of Nottingham by granting it a charter of incorporation\r\nunder the title of “the mayor and burgesses of the town of Nottingham.”\r\nBy this charter the town, with the exception of the king’s castle and\r\ngaol, was entirely separated from the county and made into a shire; its\r\nbailiffs became sheriffs, and were henceforth not to go out of the town\r\nto take their oath, but were to be sworn before the mayor; and the\r\nmayor himself was made the king’s escheator.[660] If the king in these\r\ndifficult times, with Normandy almost lost, and England on the eve of\r\nrebellion, offered bribes for loyalty, he required a due return; and in\r\n1450 the Nottingham men had to pay their part of the bargain, by hiring\r\nmen to go to the help of the sovereign at Blackheath against Jack Cade,\r\nwhich they accomplished by leasing some of their common lands for a sum\r\nof £20 to be paid in advance.[661]\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, owing to the loss of the Old Red Book of Nottingham\r\nand other records, it is only by piecing together scattered hints\r\nand fragments that we can discern anything of the early constitution\r\nof the borough. In the first charters or official dealings with the\r\ncourt, we hear of “the Burgesses” only, with no mention of reeve or\r\nbailiff; until after the creation of the mayor in 1284, when the formal\r\nstyle is changed to “the Mayor and Burgesses.” Whatever was the actual\r\nsignificance of the term “burgesses” we know that it already had a\r\ntechnical meaning, for a charter granted by Edward the First to “the\r\nBurgesses and Community of our town” in the days before the mayor had\r\nreplaced the reeve,[662] shows that even then the two words were used\r\nin a special sense; and this original distinction remains throughout\r\nthe records of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. In general, the\r\nbusiness of the town was done in a somewhat elaborate manner by “the\r\nmayor, burgesses, and community,” or “the mayor and his co-burgesses\r\nand the community”; but it seems that there were some affairs which\r\nwere given over to the “mayor and burgesses”—an occasional treaty with\r\nanother town,[663] or the letting of tenements or property acquired by\r\nthe corporation and set apart for special public purposes such as the\r\nferm, or of lands assigned for the expenses of the bridge; while on the\r\nother hand, where the common property of the people in house or land\r\nwas in question transactions were carried out in the name of the “mayor\r\nand community.”[664] There are perhaps no more than two cases before\r\nthe middle of the sixteenth century in which common lands were leased\r\nby the “mayor and burgesses,” and these happened as late as 1511 and\r\n1514, and were probably acts of a specially corrupt administration.\r\n\r\nBy the Nottingham folk themselves, therefore, the word “burgesses”\r\nwas from the thirteenth century onwards applied to a body which could\r\nbe distinguished from the commonalty; and in the use of the words we\r\nseem again to catch the double meaning, first of the corporate body\r\nof citizens as opposed to the ancient “communitas”; and then of the\r\ngoverning council or assembly as opposed to the whole congregation of\r\nthe freemen. When this secondary use of the words grew up in Nottingham\r\nwe cannot say, as we know absolutely nothing of the early government\r\nof the town. It is only through one or two brief notices which have\r\nbeen saved from the general destruction of old records that we detect\r\nthe presence in the council chamber of a recognized group of officials\r\nor councillors; and these notices belong to a late time. Meetings were\r\nheld in the town hall in 1435 and 1443, in which a council of justices\r\nof the peace and “trustworthy men” did business with the consent of the\r\ncommons;[665] and in 1443 we hear of a fine to be paid by “burgesses”\r\nwho neglected to come to the hall when summoned, the fine being (as\r\nwe learn from other towns) the customary sum levied from absent\r\nmembers of a regularly appointed council.[666] And from another entry\r\ncopied from the records of three years later we know certainly that\r\na council of twelve did exist in 1446. “Ordered that twelve and the\r\nmayor chosen to order, end, and dispose of as they think meet of all\r\nthings belonging to the commonalty of the town without interruption or\r\ncontradiction of any person within the town. All orders are with the\r\nconsent of the commonalty.”[667]\r\n\r\nWhether the order of 1446 was the bringing in of a new method of\r\nadministration, or an extension of the powers of an established\r\ncouncil, or merely a declaration of the law that it should do its\r\nbusiness “without interruption or contradiction” of any of the\r\ntownsfolk, we cannot certainly tell, for the old Red Book is lost and\r\nthe phrase is only preserved for us in a note made by a town clerk a\r\nhundred and fifty years later, whose comment on it, “And there shall\r\nyou see the erection and election of the council,” is of little value\r\nin deciding the matter.[668] In the absence of any direct evidence,\r\nthe traces of an earlier council certainly suggest the idea that in\r\nthe twelve we may have the successors of a body resembling the twelve\r\nportmen elected in royal boroughs for the general administration of\r\nthe town, and that from 1399 the four justices of the peace formed\r\npart of this council. The commonalty had the right of entering the\r\ntown hall during the meetings of the council, and of confirming the\r\nordinances of the governing body by their “assent and consent”; and\r\nthese powers might of course be more or less left in suspense or fully\r\nexercized as opportunity required. No doubt in a big and busy borough\r\nany frequent gathering of the townspeople was impossible, and it is\r\nvery probable that (as at Sandwich), when the mayor did business in\r\nthe borough court, any burghers who happened to be present[669] were\r\ntaken to represent the general assembly of the commons, and bye-laws or\r\nnecessary orders passed by them were understood to have received “the\r\nconsent of the community.” In the majority of instances the numbers who\r\nattended were probably few, but their presence is from time to time\r\ndistinctly marked, as in the meeting of 1435; in the assembly of a\r\nhundred and thirty burgesses in 1463 to make laws; and in the calling\r\nof the commons together in their common hall in 1480.[670]\r\n\r\nIf the administration followed this well understood routine, it is\r\nprobable that the conduct of public business underwent no great change\r\nwhen two new charters, in 1446 and 1448, settled the final order of\r\ngovernment in Nottingham, and made it into a county. No mention was\r\nmade in these charters of the existing council (unless indeed the term\r\n“burgesses” was commonly understood to mean the council),[671] but by\r\nthe second in 1448 it was enacted that “the burgesses” should elect\r\nfrom time to time _from amongst themselves_ seven aldermen (to answer\r\nto the seven wards of the town), one of whom was always to be mayor,\r\nwhile all the seven were to be justices of the peace. The aldermen were\r\nto hold office for life, and in their scarlet livery with suitable furs\r\nand linings, after the fashion of the aldermen of London,[672] were\r\nmanifestly the leading members of the council; and the six burgesses\r\nwho completed that body were within a few years known as “common\r\ncouncillors,” to distinguish them from the heads of the wards.[673]\r\nThe constitution of the Nottingham council seems in fact to have been\r\nexactly the same as that of Canterbury or of Southampton; and here no\r\ndoubt, as in other places, the official governing body did at some time\r\ntake to itself in a special sense the title of “the Burgesses,” leaving\r\nthat of “the Community” to the freemen at large.\r\n\r\nThe new charter, whether it introduced any change in older methods or\r\nno, at least seems to have awakened no resistance. A Council of Twelve\r\nwhich ruled before 1448 ruled in like manner afterwards, though now\r\nseven justices of the peace sat in it instead of four. As for what may\r\nseem to us the crucial fact that henceforward aldermen were elected\r\nfor life, and elected by their own fellows and not by the people, it\r\nis possible that even this change, if indeed it was a change at all,\r\nseemed less revolutionary to the men of Nottingham in those days than\r\nit does now, for there is no trace of any conflict concerning the\r\nmatter either at the time or for half a century afterwards. Indeed the\r\nsame method of election was used for the councillors themselves, who\r\nalso were appointed for life.[674] It appears that while the aldermen\r\nwere always selected from among the six councillors, the councillors\r\nwere chosen from “the clothing”—a very important body composed of\r\nsheriffs and chamberlains or treasurers who had passed out of office,\r\nbut still wore their scarlet robes on great occasions.[675]\r\n\r\nThe oligarchy thus established was however no more in absolute\r\npossession of the field than an oligarchy of the thirteenth century.\r\nThe people’s right to hold a general assembly was admitted by the\r\ngoverning class as late as 1480, and claimed by the commonalty\r\na century later. The jurors of the Court Leet long acted as\r\nrepresentatives of the general body of burgesses for purposes of\r\ncriticism and remonstrance. For certain kinds of business touching the\r\ncommunity the custom of electing special juries was maintained; as in\r\n1458 when “twenty-four upright and lawful men from the aforesaid town\r\nof Nottingham, as well as twenty-four upright and lawful men from each\r\nwapentake of the county aforesaid”[676] were summoned to report on the\r\nstate of the bridge. It seems probable that at least six burghers took\r\npart in the election of municipal officers; and in 1511 the inhabitants\r\nclaimed some share in the elections by virtue of “the statute of\r\nfree elections in such cases ordained.”[677] Above all the burghers\r\nexercized their ancient rights over the common property of the people.\r\nFor in those days Nottingham boasted of great possessions[678] in\r\nland. From the low cliff of red sandstone which lifted it out of the\r\nfloods that constantly swamped the lower grounds, the townsmen looked\r\nout over the common fields and closes and Lammas lands that stretched\r\nround it on every side, and formed until the Act of 1845 a broad\r\nbelt of open country which cut off the borough from its surrounding\r\ndependent villages, and might in no way be used for building. These\r\nwide reaches of pasture were yearly distributed in due proportion among\r\nthe burghers by common consent of the mayor and the whole community.\r\nIn the division, and in questions of boundaries and fences and fields,\r\nthe commonalty were all directly interested; and they never consented\r\nto hand over to the undisputed management of a council rights which\r\ntouched them so nearly.[679] They asserted their claim to attend the\r\nmeetings when the lands were divided or let out on lease, to take part\r\nin all decisions, and to keep a close watch on the councillors lest\r\nthese should be tempted to pass over their own names when the poor\r\nlands were divided and to distribute among themselves all the best\r\ncloses.[680] At the very end of the fifteenth century their verdict was\r\nstill decisive. In 1480 the commons being called together to the Common\r\nHall by the mayor on a question as to the common lands, “the said\r\ncommons would in no wise agree” to his proposal.[681]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore probable that the charter of 1448 did not mark for\r\nNottingham the moment of a serious constitutional revolution. Such\r\nlittle evidence as we have seems to show that the state of affairs\r\nwas singularly like that which we have already seen in Southampton\r\nat the same date; that things went on pretty much as they had done\r\nfor years past, and that the burgesses neither suffered, nor thought\r\nthey suffered, any usurpation of their rights, or any grave loss of\r\ncustomary liberties. The system established in 1448 had been in full\r\nworking for over half a century before any struggle, so far as we know,\r\ntook place between the governing class and the people; and even then it\r\nwas not suggested that the disturbance was caused by any change in the\r\nlegal form of government.[682] For in 1500 Nottingham was in as sorry a\r\nplight as Norwich had been in 1300. It was practically handed over to\r\nthe rule of publicans and licensed victuallers, who, with or without\r\nthe law, held their own bravely against all opposition. When brewers\r\nand bakers and vintners rose to power they took care that the assize of\r\nbread and beer and wine should not be brought to mind; when butchers\r\nand cattle-dealers became aldermen and chamberlains they encouraged\r\na confusion which was most profitable to themselves as to the limits\r\nof the common pastures, letting gates and bridges fall into ruin,\r\nand “although they have been often required by the whole community\r\nof the whole town of Nottingham to make common boundary marks, as\r\ntheir predecessors had done, have hitherto refused to do so;”[683]\r\neven as common trespassers they put their cattle and sheep in the\r\nmeadow in the night time unto the great harm of their neighbours.[684]\r\nThe officers appointed by the council dutifully served the interests\r\nof their masters: “We often complain of his demeanour, and have no\r\nremedy”[685] is the comment of the Mickletorn jury about the common\r\nserjeant. Year after year the protests of the commonalty were heard at\r\nthe local courts. Jurors of the quarter sessions laid their grievances\r\nbefore the justices of the peace, themselves the main offenders; while\r\nthe jury of the Mickletorn or Leet asserted their right to address the\r\ntown council (when they could be persuaded to take their places at the\r\ncourt) and “in the name of the burgesses and commonalty of this town,”\r\nto declare the wrongs of the people.[686]\r\n\r\nIt was in 1511 that the struggle between rulers and burghers\r\nculminated. In the August of that year the council seems to have\r\nviolated the ancient custom, and leased common pastures by the\r\nauthority of “the mayor and burgesses,” the witnesses being six\r\naldermen and six of the common council[687]—a style which had not\r\nbeen used before in dealing with these lands. This meddling with the\r\nrights of the community apparently heralded an outbreak of revolt. At\r\nthe next Court Leet, in October, 1511, the Mickletorn jury presented\r\nthe mayor who had been in power when the lease was granted, and charged\r\nhim with encroaching on the common lands, and making his servants\r\n“riotously break off our common pasture hedges; it is thought contrary\r\nto right and to the common weal.” Six months later, in April, 1512,\r\nthe jury extended their attack, and the actual “Master Mayor” was\r\npresented for being the first beginner of a muck-hill, for misusing\r\nthe time of the common serjeant, and for selling unfit herrings in the\r\nmarket and excluding other men who would have brought as good stuff\r\nand sold eight for a penny where he sold five, though as clerk of the\r\nmarket he should have increased and bettered it instead of impairing\r\nit, “and upon this runneth a great slander in the country and a great\r\ncomplaint.” He was charged, along with “all his brethren,” with failing\r\nto account for money in his charge “to the great hurt of the town and\r\ncommons.” Further the mayor and chamberlains together were presented\r\nfor not repairing the two gates of the town; and the chamberlains for\r\nnot looking after a public well; and the mayor’s clerk, “the which\r\ntakes our wages not as a beneficial servant unto us in no matter that\r\nany burgess of this town hath to do, but he repugnes and maligns\r\nagainst the burgesses and commons that they be not content with his\r\ndemeanour.”[688]\r\n\r\nThe commons went further than this, however, and raised the question\r\nof their ancient rights of assembling in the common hall and taking\r\npart in the election of officers.[689] At this point the authorities\r\nbecame genuinely alarmed. A month later, May 21, the Recorder or\r\nlegal adviser of the corporation wrote a formal letter of advice to\r\nthe governing body on these crucial matters of election and assembly.\r\n“I am informed,” he says, “that divers of the commons of your town\r\nconfederate themselves together and make sinister labour to do others\r\nto take their part and say as they do, and intend thereby to make\r\naldermen and other officers at their pleasure; and if that should be\r\nsuffered it should be contrary to all good politic order and rule,\r\nand in conclusion to the destruction of the town. Wherefore now at\r\nthe beginning wisely withstand the same and call your brethren and\r\nthe council together, and if ye by your wisdom think that by calling\r\nof these confederates every of them severally before you ye cannot\r\norder them without further help, then my advice is that ye send some\r\nwise person to Mr. Treasurer[690] that it would please him to see\r\nreformation, if he be in England, and else that he would write to my\r\nLord Privy Seal, or to my Lord Steward, now in his absence to see this\r\nmatter redressed, ascertaining you have spoke with my Lord Steward in\r\nthis matter, and he gave me advice thus to write to you; for if ye\r\nshall suffer the commons to rule and follow their appetite and desire,\r\nfarewell all good order. For if they be suffered now they will wait\r\nto do in like case hereafter.” In a postscript he adds, “In any wise\r\nbeware of calling of any common hall at the request of any one of them\r\nthat make this confederacy. I doubt not but divers of you remember the\r\nsaying of Mr. Treasurer of the inconveniences that had ensued upon the\r\ncalling of the commons together in the city of London and in other\r\ncities and boroughs.”[691] The sympathies of Mr. Treasurer were duly\r\nenlisted, according to the Recorder’s advice, and on the very day when\r\na new mayor took the place of the last, he wrote urging him to stand\r\nfirm against those commons who would “combine themselves to subvert the\r\ngood rule of the town and would make aldermen and put them out at their\r\npleasure, contrary to the good order of your charter and privilege of\r\nyour town.” He begs them, if there be any of such “wilful disposition\r\nto subvert the good rule of the same your said town, that with all\r\ndiligence certify me of their names, and I trust to see such remedy for\r\nthem as shall not be to their contentment, but I shall see them shewn\r\ncondign punishment as they have or shall deserve.”[692]\r\n\r\nThe shibboleth of “good order” had its accustomed effect, and the\r\ngoverning body carried their point, though in leases of the common\r\nlands they presently returned to the old style.[693] The new mayor,\r\nJohn Rose, known to the people as the butcher chamberlain who in 1500\r\nhad let their landmarks be removed, and who since then had grown\r\ninto innkeeper and victualler, ruled for eighteen months.[694] His\r\nsuccessor, appointed in January, 1515,[695] was Master Thomas Mellers,\r\nan alderman who had a very bad reputation in the presentments of the\r\nCourt Leet; after he had reigned two years, a mercer of Nottingham\r\ntried to kill him with a dagger while he was joyfully dining with an\r\nalderman; but he survived to rule again in 1522.[696] Again the jury\r\nreturned to the charge. In 1524 the outgoing mayor was presented at\r\nthe July sessions for not keeping the assize of bread,[697] and in\r\nOctober the matter was pressed on the attention of the newly-appointed\r\nmayor. Two years later, however, Nottingham was for the third time put\r\nunder John Rose, who in the interests of firm government determined\r\nto suppress once for all the importunate presentments of the jury.\r\nDuring the whole time of his mayoralty, “in the default of the said\r\nMaster Rose there was no verdict given of the jurors sworn for the\r\nbody of this present town ... to inquire of things inquirable\r\nafore you justices of record,” nor was the assize of victual ever\r\nput in execution; and by this the town had not only been greatly\r\ndisordered but had been put in danger of forfeiting its liberties\r\nand franchises.[698] The next year (1527) the jury were again roused\r\nby the fact that three aldermen, one of them being Rose, the last\r\nyear’s mayor, had by their united efforts filled all vacancies with\r\nvictuallers; and a formal petition was addressed to the mayor and his\r\nbrethren in the name of the whole town. They called to remembrance\r\nthe law that “No victualler should be chosen to no such rooms as\r\njudge of victual,” and told again the long tale of their grievances.\r\nThey declare that these elections were illegal, “the burgesses and\r\ncommonalty of the said town not being made privy, nor thereunto\r\nconsenting, contrary to the corporation of the said town, and also\r\ncontrary to the statute of free elections in such case ordained,” and\r\nthat therefore the whole town might be made to suffer the loss of their\r\nliberties and franchises for non-using or misusing the same. In the\r\nlately elected aldermen “the want of discretion and debility of reason”\r\nwas well known to the whole town, so that the common voice and fame of\r\nit ran through the shire; and the jurors thought “that the most wisest\r\nand discreetest men ought to have been chosen to such rooms by you and\r\nthe burgesses _and commonalty_.”\r\n\r\nFurther the jury, “in their most humble manner,” observed that the king\r\nhad been deceived in the matter of the last subsidy; for in addition\r\nto their other crimes the three aldermen, when their substance was\r\nassessed for a subsidy at £50 or £55, had “embezzled” the record, and\r\nchanged the figures to a nought.\r\n\r\nFinally they pray “by the whole minds and agreements” that the present\r\ncounsel of the town might use and continue in his place “like as he\r\nunto the same was elect and sworn, and that according to right and\r\ngood conscience he may have his fees that is behind to him contented\r\nand paid.”[699] All this the jury spoke in the name of the people,\r\n“whereunto we, the aforesaid jurors, in the name of the burgesses and\r\ncommonalty of this town and borough are fully content and agreed.”\r\n\r\nIn these troubles, it does not seem that the revolt of the people was\r\nexcited by any definite constitutional change, nor was the charter\r\nof 1448 called in question or brought forward as the origin of later\r\nevils, nor was any protest made against the election of councillors for\r\nlife. Complaints multiply against corrupt administration of the law, or\r\nthe holding of office by unfit and illegal men. But the claim of the\r\npeople to a share in elections is vague and indefinite, and neither\r\nin 1511 nor in 1527 do the commons appeal to precedent. Opinions as\r\nto their rights are tossed to and fro, balanced by contending winds\r\nof doctrine. In defence of the system of close election the council\r\ncall to witness the charter and privileges of the town; while on the\r\nother hand the commons declare that elections are illegal if the\r\ncommonalty as well as the burgesses are not “made privy nor thereunto\r\nconsenting.” Possibly the explanation lies in a common tendency of\r\npractice to drift away from the theory with which it had first kept\r\ncompany, and finally to disown its old accomplice. No doubt the commons\r\ninherited theoretically an inalienable right to take part in elections;\r\nbut it had apparently become the practice that the people should only\r\nexercise that right in a certain definite way through the half-dozen\r\nrepresentatives who attended the elections, and not through a common\r\ngathering; and thus the situation was one in which either side might\r\nindefinitely urge law and custom without ever bringing conviction to\r\ntheir opponents.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed conceivable that the true peril to popular liberty was\r\nof a far more subtle character than the words of any charter would\r\nsuggest, and rather grew out of developements in the unwritten\r\nconstitution of the borough, than in the written law. Not only in\r\nelections, but in the meeting of the general assembly, insidious\r\nchanges may have been brought about by the mere growth of common\r\ncustom. In the institution of “the Clothing” there were latent\r\npossibilities which time alone could bring to light. For over half a\r\ncentury sheriffs and chamberlains were quietly bowed out of office,\r\nand transferred with all their fur and finery to the brilliant company\r\nof the liveried ex-officials to await a happy re-election. But in due\r\ncourse, as its numbers multiplied, the Clothing was made manifest to\r\nall men in its stately ranks or “clene scarlet” as the very body-guard\r\nand sworn defenders of the central group of high officials, the\r\ntraditional depositories of power. Surrounded and shielded by a band\r\nof forty or fifty friends who had already held office and might hold\r\nit again, men dedicated to their interests and disciplined to their\r\nmethods, the mayor and his brethren were no longer left face to face\r\nwith the whole community. Under the established custom by which any\r\nburgesses who were present at an assembly were taken to represent\r\nthe whole body, it was evidently easy even while outwardly observing\r\nconstitutional form, to summon to the meeting only members of the\r\nClothing; and the decrees of the council having been submitted to\r\nthis loyal gathering were assumed to have obtained the assent of the\r\ncommonalty. Popular control might thus be absolutely extinguished, and\r\nthat without revolution or going beyond the letter of the law, when\r\na council chamber crowded with the official class[700] replaced the\r\nassembly of the commons, and exercized its powers simply by preserving\r\nits name.\r\n\r\nThe plan of forming a select committee of the General Assembly\r\nnominated by the mayor seems to have been a very favourite custom.\r\nIn Coventry, for example, the mayor summoned certain citizens who\r\nwere added to the twenty-four to form a common council. Their number\r\nwas perhaps at first uncertain, for in 1444 we hear of a meeting\r\nof fifty-three, twenty-four of the council and twenty-nine other\r\nburgesses; but apparently from 1477 twenty-four citizens always\r\nassembled with the twenty-four jurats to form the common council of\r\nforty-eight. Generally, as in Leicester or Gloucester, a fixed number\r\nof representative citizens was summoned. A lower chamber of this\r\npattern evidently assured the triumph of the oligarchy; and the idea of\r\npopular control was perhaps more completely banished by this narrow and\r\nformal interpretation of the common right of meeting than by mere idle\r\nneglect of the assembly. In Nottingham, so far as we can judge from\r\nthe few council minutes preserved during the sixteenth century, the\r\nmayor and his brethren acted with perfect independence of the burgesses\r\nat large, and no longer mentioned the name of the community even in\r\nordinances which touched the common lands.[701]\r\n\r\nStill, however, the jury fought with indefatigable zeal for some\r\ncontrol over administration.[702] They never let slip a chance of\r\nreprimanding their governors. Again and again the mayor was presented\r\nfor refusing to enforce judgment on bakers, butchers, and brewers,[703]\r\nand with his brethren was charged with innumerable frauds on the\r\npeople. Sometimes we find the jury busied about securing a capable\r\nschoolmaster;[704] sometimes they were demanding to have the accounts\r\nlaid before them—the accounts of the bridge and the free school and\r\nthe sums raised for the burgesses of Parliament, “and how the residue\r\nof the money is bestowed, for our money is therein as well as yours\r\nwas, and therefore it is convenient that we know.”[705] As Englishmen\r\nhad once looked back to the times of the good King Edward, so the men\r\nof Nottingham turned wistfully to the golden past when the Red Book\r\nhad been the charter of their liberties, and vainly prayed that the\r\nnecessary parts of the book (doubtless the ancient town ordinances)\r\nshould as of old be read yearly in the hearing of the burgesses.[706]\r\nClinging to the ideal of a primitive liberty, these inveterate\r\nconservatives robbed reform of all the terrors that attached to what\r\nwas new. What had been might safely be again. Nor was there any\r\ntendency to riot or disorder. All must be done in a constitutional\r\nway, and within the limits of tradition. Towards the end of the\r\nsixteenth century, therefore, there was a good deal of tinkering at the\r\nmunicipal constitution. On March 29 (1577) the number of councillors\r\nwas increased from six to twelve, all as before to be chosen by the\r\nClothing.[707] The democracy had probably very little to say to this\r\nchange, for the order was made by forty-five burgesses “being then\r\nall of the degree of chamberlains” who seem here clearly to be acting\r\nas though their assent to an ordinance were equivalent to the consent\r\nof the whole community.[708] Six months later, however, it occurred\r\nto the people to make some use of the ancient custom of summoning a\r\njury of forty-eight from town and suburbs for public business; and\r\nthey proposed to have the common council elected by such a jury—to\r\nwhich suggestion the ruling class agreed. They further demanded that\r\nthe councillors should attend at the Leet when the Mickletorn jury\r\npresented offences and gave their verdicts. All this was, as they\r\nclaimed, a return to the authentic custom of former days, “according to\r\nthe Red Book as we do think.”[709] But in November the Leet jury were\r\nstill praying that this agreement should be carried out, and there is\r\nno evidence that they ever succeeded. In any case, two years later,\r\nwhen the people once more urged their old claim to have the accounts\r\nmade public and “to hear the end and reckoning of any subsidy when any\r\nis,”[710] they advanced a new demand for reform yet more radical; and\r\nsuggested that all the common councillors should be utterly abolished,\r\nleaving only the aldermen and two coroners to form an upper chamber,\r\n“and that the forty-eight may be joined to you to confer in any matters\r\nfor the town, as there is in other places where their corporations\r\nare better governed than this is,”[711] and that the same forty-eight\r\nas representing the commons should be given a definite share in the\r\nmanagement of the bridge and school.[712]\r\n\r\nBut all these efforts proved vain, and the Council and Clothing\r\ncontinued their victorious career. As late as 1598 the commons\r\nendeavoured to revive the old constitution of the town and to call\r\na general assembly through summons by the constables of the wards;\r\nand even collected money to institute a suit that they might inquire\r\ninto a corrupt lease of common property by a member of the council.\r\nIn the curious account preserved of the examination and depositions\r\nof the ringleaders in calling the assembly together the passionate\r\ndetermination of the people still finds voice, and there was at least\r\none among them to maintain stoutly that he did not care if he died in\r\na good cause.[713] The beginning of the next century found the contest\r\nslowly dragging along, the Mickletorn jury still protesting against the\r\nnegligence of the councillors[714] and the people still discussing new\r\nconstitutions with increasing nicety of detail, and debating the merits\r\nof two chambers of twenty-four and forty-eight,[715] or of twenty-eight\r\neach.[716] Meanwhile the twelve of the council are mentioned as\r\nexisting unchanged in 1604.[717]\r\n\r\nBy this time the men of Nottingham had adopted in turn all the\r\nconstitutional means of securing popular freedom that lay in their\r\nreach. They had consistently appealed to the old ordinances which in\r\ntheory at least endowed them with sovereign power. The Mickletorn\r\njury had been incessantly called on to right their wrongs by force of\r\nlaw. The cumbrous machinery of the general assembly had been dragged\r\nout in its noisy inefficiency. The custom of summoning forty-eight\r\njurors for public purposes had been seized on as an institution out\r\nof which a chamber of the commons might be created and representative\r\ngovernment established. But the mediæval history of Nottingham\r\ncloses with the utter failure of schemes so industriously cherished.\r\nDoubtless reform had tarried too long in coming. Whether the general\r\ncommercial prosperity had drawn all activity into trading enterprise\r\nand diverted it from politics, whether a common well-being had tended\r\nto an acquiescent conservatism, whether the variety of trades carried\r\non in the town had, as in modern Birmingham, resulted in the absence\r\nof effective trade organization or of any strong and commanding craft\r\nguild to serve as a centre of union, or whether in this wealthy\r\ncommunity buried in the Midlands there was some lack of ready\r\ninterchange of thought and discussion with the outer world, the fact\r\nremains that resistance to the dominion of an oligarchy was of late\r\nand ineffectual growth, and when it did appear it seems to have mostly\r\nlost its energies in talk. In 1600 the men of Nottingham were still\r\ndiscussing the formation of a House of Commons to represent the will of\r\nthe people—an experiment which Norwich had tried two hundred years\r\nbefore, and for which in municipal life it was now two hundred years\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nThus in the history of civic freedom Nottingham seems to stand midway\r\nbetween Southampton and Norwich. Not only did it in the fifteenth\r\ncentury closely follow Southampton in the critical dates of its\r\nmunicipal history, but it is certain that its local administration must\r\nhave been a matter of no less importance to the Crown from a military\r\npoint of view. In times of disturbance it was all-important to the king\r\nto keep a firm hold on the Midlands and on their central stronghold,\r\nand preserve as it were a “buffer state” between north and south, east\r\nand west; and we have seen how quick was the central government to take\r\nalarm at any “confederacy” to “subvert the good rule of the town,” and\r\nhow anxiously, as in Southampton, it interfered to protect the select\r\noligarchy against the “sinister labour” of the commons. On the other\r\nhand the belief of its people in an ideal liberty, steeped as it is\r\nin strong emotion, is far removed from the apathy of the Southampton\r\nburghers. In the aspirations of its commonalty Nottingham comes nearer\r\nto Norwich, but here there is a profound difference not only in the\r\nconduct of the controversy between rulers and subjects but in its final\r\nissue; and the council of the commons which the oligarchy was able to\r\nassemble by stealth in Nottingham has no likeness to the lower chamber\r\ncreated by the middle classes themselves in Norwich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON COUNCIL OF NORWICH\r\n\r\n\r\nWHEN we turn from the southern to the eastern coast the first\r\nimpression is that of being transported to a new atmosphere. It is not\r\nonly that the outer forms of administration are different, for these\r\ndifferences, however interesting, are but the changes rung on a common\r\nsystem of local self-government. But in the political temper, the\r\nvitality of the popular institutions, the vigour of reform, we breathe\r\na bracing air unknown in the Southampton docks and slums.\r\n\r\nFor the traders and artizans of the eastern coast lived in an\r\nexhilarating clime. Across the water the towns with which they traded\r\nwere full of the movement of a free expansive life, very different from\r\nthe political depression of the communes which the Southampton traders\r\nknew best. It was to the eastern coast that immigrants came flying from\r\ntyranny and clamorous for freedom; and traders from the eastern towns\r\nwho watched in the streets of Ghent and Bruges and Ipres and Dinant,\r\nthe violent and tumultuous life of cities where the people were still\r\nfighting for liberty, doubtless brought back from oversea tales of the\r\npassionate temper of independence which swept through the manufacturing\r\nboroughs of the Netherlands.\r\n\r\nBut however this may be, the towns of the east were distinguished by\r\nan intense vitality; and among the eastern boroughs where civic life\r\nwas keenest and most fertile in experiment, Norwich was the pioneer\r\nin the way of freedom,—twenty or forty years ahead of Yarmouth\r\nin time[718]—beyond Colchester in the generosity with which the\r\ncommonalty was called to share in the work of government[719]—happier\r\nand stronger than Lynn in having secured the union of its people into\r\none undivided community for civil purposes. It is not impossible indeed\r\nthat it stands in the forefront of all the English boroughs for the\r\nquality and value of its political experiments, and the elaborate\r\nfinish of its constitution.\r\n\r\nOriginally, as we have seen, four bailiffs ruled the four great leets\r\nof the city, from 1223 to 1403. Their mode of administration has been\r\nvery minutely described.[720] Each leet was for convenience’ sake\r\ndivided into sub-leets, the lesser divisions being at first probably\r\ntwelve in number and afterwards ten. The sub-leet was itself composed\r\nof as many parishes as grouped together would contain at least twelve\r\ntithings, and could therefore produce sufficient capital pledges to\r\nhold a leet court. For all purposes of business every tithing was\r\nsupposed to be represented by its own capital pledge, who was probably\r\nchosen by the tithing men, but who, once elected, seems to have\r\nheld his post for years, perhaps for life. He lived in the parish,\r\nperhaps in the very street of his tithing, and was generally a man\r\nof substance, one of the respectable middle class of the city, and\r\noccasionally might even aspire to enter the official body. In the\r\nwhole city the number of capital pledges was probably a hundred and\r\nsixty.[721]\r\n\r\nThe business of each sub-leet was taken in its turn before the four\r\nbailiffs all sitting together in the little thatched tolbooth that\r\nstood in the central market place. There the capital pledges appeared\r\nto answer for their tithings at the view of frankpledge; and when this\r\nbusiness was over they served as a jury for “presenting” offences at\r\nthe leet court.[722] Year after year there came up the same body of\r\ncomfortable well-to-do burghers, who did their business quietly,\r\nwithout thought of entering into any controversy with the government,\r\nlike the juries of Nottingham and Southampton.[723] Whether this was\r\nthe result of summoning the pledges in small groups from one sub-leet\r\nat a time, or due to the fact that in Norwich the people already\r\npossessed other means of expression, there is not as yet enough\r\nevidence from other towns to show, but the fact is important.\r\n\r\nIn later records we learn what was doubtless true in 1223 as well as\r\nin 1365, that one of the bailiffs was chosen for each great leet;\r\nand we also have the first account of the manner of their choosing.\r\nA body of twenty-four men, six from each leet, was elected by the\r\nwhole community, and the twenty-four then chose the bailiffs.[724] The\r\nfirst mention of a custom in fragmentary records by no means implies\r\nits first institution, and this mode of election may have dated from\r\nthe earliest times. It also appears that before the close of the\r\nthirteenth century the bailiffs were assisted in judicial business\r\nby a select body of citizens, whose share in considering the case\r\nof offenders seems to show that they were “present in the court as\r\ninformal assessors to the bailiffs, or, in other words, forming the\r\ncourt of which the bailiffs were the sole executive;”[725] and it is\r\npossible that for other business also some of the leading citizens were\r\nsummoned to attend at assemblies, and their name affixed to deeds,\r\nseparately or collectively.[726] A complaint of “the mean people of the\r\ncommonalty”[727] shows that administration and taxation had even at\r\nthat early time fallen into the hands of a small body—the bailiffs and\r\n“the rich”; and the “customs” of the city (which were perhaps drawn up\r\nabout 1340, but which must in many respects contain traditional usages\r\nof an earlier date) give us some idea who were “the rich” here spoken\r\nof. A body of twenty-four men elected by the community, six from each\r\nof the four great leets, is there described as forming a court for the\r\ncontrol of the whole trade of the city. It appointed supervisors over\r\nthe various crafts, and received reports of fraud in trade—charges\r\nwhich, if it had not been for the intervention of the twenty-four,\r\nwould have gone to the leet juries. And the same body of twenty-four\r\nhad official supervision of the city finances and received all accounts\r\nof the treasurers and collectors of taxes or town money.[728] Once\r\nmore, in 1344, we find them exercising yet another function—“the\r\ntwenty-four in the same year elected and ordained by the whole\r\ncommunitas, in the presence of whom, or of the greater part of them, if\r\nall cannot be present, the business of the city touching the communitas\r\nmight be enrolled.”\r\n\r\nLastly it appears that the twenty-four gradually assumed the power of\r\nmaking laws for the community, and “used this custom that they might\r\nremedy new defaults and mischiefs arising by making new ordinances for\r\nthe common profit of the town and the citizens and of others coming\r\nor conversant there.”[729] Apparently the assembly itself was almost\r\nsuperseded, for on the plea that when assemblies were summoned for the\r\ncommon good of the city and the country, the citizens did not take the\r\ntrouble to come, to the great hindrance of public business, it had been\r\nordained some time before 1340 that for the calling together of the\r\ncommonalty the bailiff’s serjeant should summon certain of the most\r\nworthy and discreet men of each leet who were to be fined two shillings\r\nif they failed to obey the summons.[730]\r\n\r\nA council of leading citizens, though it was already organized in\r\nthis elaborate way early in the fourteenth century, scarcely appears\r\nin records of the later thirteenth century, and even then dimly in a\r\nvague inchoate form. It is, however, important to notice that from the\r\nvery beginning two official styles were in use in the city documents,\r\nwhich seem at no time to have been interchangeable one with another.\r\nIn the Pipe Roll of 1255 there seems to be a distinction between “the\r\ncitizens” and “the men of Norwich”;[731] and both in this year and\r\nlater, whenever the borough has any dealings with Westminster it is\r\n“the citizens” who ask for favours, and it is to “our beloved citizens,\r\nthey and their heirs,” or to “the bailiffs and citizens their heirs\r\nand successors” that grants are made throughout the thirteenth and\r\nfourteenth centuries.[732] Exceptions to this form are rare. In 1347\r\nwhen Edward the Third asked for soldiers to be furnished for the\r\nFrench war he addressed himself to “the mayor, bailiffs, and the whole\r\ncommunity”;[733] but as there was at that time no mayor in Norwich, the\r\nphrase was possibly that of a new clerk brought into the War Office\r\nin a hurried rush of business. In 1355 he sent a close letter to the\r\n“bailiffs and commonalty” of Norwich to provide him with a hundred and\r\ntwenty armed men; and in 1371 a letter to the “bailiffs, good people,\r\nor commons” of Norwich to fit him out a ship. In all these cases it is\r\nobvious that the king’s claim on the people was altogether independent\r\nof any obligations resting on them as citizens of a chartered borough.\r\nVery rarely did the community address the king. In 1304 and 1307[734]\r\nthe “mean people of the commonalty of the city” asked his aid; and\r\nonce “the commune of the town of Norwich” sent a special petition\r\nto Parliament. The city liberties had been forfeited into the King’s\r\nhands in 1285, and the royal officer set over it had wrongfully\r\ndistrained the people’s goods to the value of £300;[735] but since\r\n“the citizens” in the technical sense of a corporate body possessing\r\ncertain rights ceased to exist when the city lost its franchise, the\r\nNorwich people had to fall back on that which lay behind all chartered\r\ncorporations—on that out of which all other rights had sprung; it\r\nwas to “the commune of the town” that wrong had been done, and “the\r\ncommune” appealed against it. On the other hand, whenever a question\r\narose as to common lands or common property the business was always\r\ndone in the name of “the commonalty” or “the bailiffs and commonalty,”\r\nand in such cases the style of “the citizens” was never used.[736]\r\n\r\nThere seems, therefore, ground for thinking that from first to last\r\nthe Norwich burghers officially described themselves by two distinct\r\nstyles, which to the common understanding had different meanings, and\r\nwere not used at hazard. I venture to suggest that here and elsewhere\r\n“cives” was the term used for the corporate body of citizens possessing\r\nchartered rights; while “communitas” stood for the citizens in another\r\naspect, as the community which held property and enjoyed privileges\r\nby immemorial custom, before the charter of a free borough had been\r\nobtained. The holding of common property was probably the signal\r\nsurvival of customary rights, the others being gradually merged in the\r\nprivileges enjoyed by charter; and hence it was in deeds relating to\r\nland that the traditional form of “cives et communitas” was chiefly\r\npreserved. In every town in England, however, whatever might be its\r\nspecial constitution, we find other rights universally claimed by the\r\ncommons, which carried an authority that their opponents never dared\r\nin any single instance to gainsay, even when they sought to evade\r\nit. We may, perhaps, date back to a distant past the claim of the\r\nwhole community to have all laws ratified by their “entire assent\r\nand consent,” to be made privy and consenting to all elections, to\r\nknow verily how the town moneys were raised and spent, to admit new\r\nburgesses by the common vote of the people. These were rights which the\r\noligarchies constantly endeavoured to make void from the time of Henry\r\nthe Third to the time of Henry the Eighth; yet no attempt was ever made\r\nto deny or to revoke them. It may be that their authentic force was\r\nderived from that obscure time of which no memory is, when the ancient\r\n“communitas” slowly built up the great tradition of its customary\r\nrights; and that when the remembrance of the primitive community had by\r\nlapse of time fallen into the background its power was still present,\r\nand to the last the name was one of dignity and carried with it a\r\nmandate from an older world. No doubt, however, in the vulgar tongue\r\n“commonalty” came to be used in a popular sense, and sometimes with an\r\nair of obloquy or contempt, to describe the general mass of citizens\r\nwho had the right of meeting in common assembly, as distinguished from\r\nthe official class. For by degrees old lines of division between the\r\nruling and the subject classes were drawn sharper and deeper—when\r\ngovernment by the select few took legal form; when a council of\r\ntwenty-four sat as assessors in the courts, audited the town accounts,\r\ncontrolled its trade, and claimed to make its laws; when the assembly\r\nwas reduced to a gathering of special men called by the bailiff’s\r\nserjeant; and when even the attendance at the leet began to fall off as\r\nat the end of the fourteenth century[737] its business passed more and\r\nmore into the hands of the twenty-four. Then the word “communitas” took\r\na new shade of meaning. Before 1378 “the citizens” had come to mean in\r\ncommon talk the governing council, as opposed to the “commonalty” who\r\nwere left outside.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the legal privileges of the community still remained.\r\nThey had a claim on part at least of the public property. No new\r\nburgher could be admitted save by the act of the whole commonalty, or\r\nof twelve of them who might be taken to represent the entire body.[738]\r\nTaxes might only be assessed by will of the whole commonalty[739] or\r\nof the greater part of the same. Whatever might be the prevailing\r\nhabit, the twenty-four had no legal right to act in the name of the\r\nwhole people, and if the commons refused to obey their ordinances they\r\ncould not appeal to any court of law to enforce their submission.\r\nIn the Assembly Rolls the burghers are mentioned as sharing in the\r\nbusiness of elections, grants of money, and taxation.[740] That they\r\nasserted their rights in a way which seemed to the governing class\r\n“contrarious” we gather from the fact that in 1378 “the citizens” (who\r\nin this case must certainly have meant a very limited body) presented\r\na petition to Richard the Second in which they declared that of late\r\n“many of the commonalty of the said town have been very contrarious,\r\nand will be so still unless better remedies and ordinances be made\r\nfor good government”; and they pray that the bailiffs and twenty-four\r\ncitizens to be elected yearly by the commonalty may have power to make\r\nordinances and to amend them from time to time when necessary.[741] A\r\nship which they had just built at the king’s orders possibly commended\r\ntheir request to his judgment, and the grant of the desired charter\r\nplaced the council in a position of absolute authority, having power to\r\nissue ordinances without the consent of the people, and to enforce them\r\nby appeal to the royal courts.\r\n\r\nWhat controversies and threats of revolution agitated the men of\r\nNorwich for the twenty-five years that followed this great change\r\nwe do not know. The exact position of the twenty-four in the\r\nmunicipal assembly is not easy to trace from the paucity of existing\r\ndocuments.[742] The rolls which survive might be expected to shew\r\nsome sign of the effect of the charter of 1378 by which the official\r\nauthority of the twenty-four was established. Yet such is not the\r\ncase. The description of the Assembly both before and after remains\r\nexactly the same. A select group of citizens attends at every\r\nmeeting, and takes the whole charge of administration. Yet it is\r\nworthy of notice that neither before nor after 1378 is any order or\r\nresolution ever attributed to the twenty-four, though such orders are\r\nconstantly referred to the action of the “tota communitas.” Throughout\r\nthese rolls the only authorities mentioned are the bailiffs and the\r\ncommonalty.[743] If it is possible to believe, as I have suggested,\r\nthat the right of the community to give or withhold consent in\r\nlegislation was an immemorial custom which could not be abrogated\r\nby charter, the failure of the twenty-four to carry their point can\r\nbe understood. No doubt party feeling on both sides ran high. It\r\nbecame necessary for a settlement to have a new charter; and in 1403,\r\nprobably, at the instance of the ruling class, the city bought a fresh\r\nconstitution at the heavy price of £1,000.[744] By this charter Norwich\r\nwas made into a county; the four bailiffs were replaced by a mayor and\r\ntwo sheriffs, to be elected by the citizens and commonalty; and, in\r\nconfirming previous grants, the customary phraze used in the charters\r\nof earlier centuries, “the citizens” was replaced by “the citizens and\r\ncommonalty”—a term which is recognized in the charter as being already\r\nin use,[745] but which had not until now been invariably employed as\r\nthe official style.\r\n\r\nThe charter of Henry the Fourth seems to have been in effect a\r\nconfirmation of the charter given by Richard the Second, and to have\r\nset the victorious conclusion to the whole system of oligarchical\r\ngovernment expressed by the council of twenty-four. The people were\r\nquick to appreciate the difficulty of making use of the powers which\r\nhad been attributed to them and to perceive the tendency of the\r\ncharter. A crisis was brought about by the very first elections held\r\nunder the new constitution. The charter ordered that the sheriffs\r\nwere to be elected, not as the old bailiffs had been by the electors\r\nof the four Leets, but by “the citizens and commonalty.” In the\r\nordinary assemblies, however, made up of the twenty-four and “others\r\nof the community,” at which Parliament men, city treasurers, and\r\nofficials, had been chosen, the twenty-four were practically supreme,\r\nand elections carried out in these gatherings were, as a matter of\r\nfact, in their hands. On March 1st, 1404, a mayor was chosen, and\r\ntwelve days later two of the bailiffs were made sheriffs (the mayor’s\r\nbook says by the “cives”).[746] The altered mode of appointing the\r\nsheriffs, as compared with the more popular custom of electing the old\r\nbailiffs, immediately roused the commons. An assembly was called to\r\nframe ordinances for the new state of things, and the people determined\r\nby their own authority to create a representative council of the\r\nburghers at large. It was ordered that eighty persons should be elected\r\nto attend all assemblies and act in the name of the people. To this\r\ncouncil was given the right of nominating the sheriffs; the eighty were\r\nto go apart by themselves and name three persons, but if the commons\r\ndid not approve of their choice they had again to retire and choose\r\nother names until their masters were content. Then the town clerk\r\nand some of the eighty carried the three names to the mayor and the\r\ntwenty-four “probi homines”; the mayor chose one and the twenty-four\r\nthe other.[747] The new council took part in the Michaelmas elections\r\nof that same year 1404, when the mayor was reappointed, and two new\r\nsheriffs were chosen.\r\n\r\nThis settlement evidently excited violent hostility, and in 1415 a\r\nComposition was framed to put an end to the discords by which the city\r\nwas “divided and dissolved and in point to have been destroyed.”[748]\r\nThis document did not err on the side of any lax notions as to the\r\nseriousness of a written constitution. With pedantic nicety it touched\r\nalmost lovingly on the minutest details of ceremony and dress, as well\r\nas on the greater problems that vexed the state—the position of the\r\ntwenty-four; the rights of the commons; and the share which the two\r\nparties were to have in appointing the officers of the city.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this Composition of 1415 was to create a miniature\r\ncopy of the English kingdom, a little community governed by its\r\nthree estates, the mayor, the co-citizens of the mayor’s council,\r\nand the commons. The twenty-four “probi homines” now became “the\r\ntwenty-four co-citizens of the mayor’s council,” the mayor having the\r\nsame authority over them “as the mayor of London hath,”[749] and the\r\ndignity of the municipal House of Lords was fitly marked by their\r\ndress, a livery “furred and lined as the estate and season of the year\r\nasketh.”[750] Above all it was decreed that they should no longer be\r\na body elected yearly but should “stand corporate perpetually,” and\r\neven if this should accidentally not be embodied in the charter to be\r\nasked for later, “the citizens” declared that they could establish that\r\nlaw for themselves and not by point of charter, in virtue of the right\r\ngiven them in 1378, to make such ordinances as they chose in difficult\r\nor defective cases for which no remedy clearly existed in the city\r\nconstitution.[751]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the organization of the lower chamber was made more\r\ncomplete, and the relative position and authority of the two houses\r\nof the mimic parliament were defined with punctilious exactness. The\r\ncommon council was reduced from eighty to sixty members,[752] to be\r\nelected from the four wards by all citizens “inhabiting and having\r\nhouses on their own account.” It had its Speaker,[753] its own mode\r\nof procedure, its system of elaborate etiquette in all dealings with\r\nthe upper house. Henceforth it was to take a part in legislation\r\nwhich entirely annulled any claim “the citizens” might have put\r\nforward by virtue of their charter of 1378; for though the mayor and\r\nthe twenty-four preserved the right of proposing all new laws, “they\r\nshall nothing do nor make that may bind or charge the city without the\r\nassent of the commonalty.” All ordinances made by the upper body must\r\ntherefore be formally laid before the common council, and if it seemed\r\nto them that the matter “needeth longer advice and deliberation of\r\nanswer, they shall ask it and all that seemeth expedient for the city\r\nby the common speaker of the mayor and of his council.” If needful they\r\ncould ask for “a bill of the same matters to be delivered to them,”\r\nthat they might give their answer in the next assembly; and “the mayor\r\nshall be beholden as ofttimes as they ask it to grant them for to go\r\ntogether in an house by themselves without any denying, and none other\r\nwith them but the common speaker, and if they will have more to them as\r\noft as they ask, the mayor shall be beholden to send for them without\r\nany withsaying. And in matters that seem to the aforesaid sixty persons\r\nfor the common council that needeth not great nor long advice, be it\r\nlawful if they will, to go apart by themselves or in to the floor with\r\ntheir common speaker, and goodly and speedily, without great delay to\r\ncome in with their answer as them seemeth speedful and needful to the\r\npurpose.” Finally, in “all other points that be necessary to be had for\r\nthe welfare of the city that come not now to mind, it is committed to\r\nthe whole assembly thereupon to ordain and make remedy by ordinance and\r\nassent of the whole commonalty for profit of all the city.”[754]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of elections, however, the general assembly reappeared\r\nin full force. When a new mayor was to be chosen the two councils\r\nwere summoned to the hall; “and also all the citizens dwellers\r\nwithin the same city unto the aforesaid election shall freely come as\r\nthey are beholden, and the doors of the hall to all citizens there\r\nwilling to enter and come in shall be open and not kept, nor none from\r\nthence forbarred nor avoided but foreigners.” After the mayor and the\r\ntwenty-four had proclaimed the election from the bench they withdrew\r\nto the chamber, and the whole people in the hall then chose from among\r\nthose who had already been mayors or sheriffs two names of “sufficient”\r\npersons, “and if that any variance happen among the commons in the hall\r\nthat it may not clearly be known to the common speaker by no manner of\r\nform by him unto them, for to be put or showed, which two hath the most\r\nvoices, then the common speaker and the common clerk shall go up to the\r\nmayor and to him shall declare the variance of the people in the hall.\r\nAnd then the mayor shall give to the common speaker in commandment\r\nfor to call together the sixty persons for the common council of the\r\ncity, or as many as there be there into an house by themselves. Which\r\nthere shall try the aforesaid variance in the same form as it hath\r\nbeen and yet is used in the city of London.” The names were carried to\r\nthe chamber by the common clerk, the common speaker, and the recorder,\r\nwith six of the common council; the six commons returned to the hall,\r\nleaving the three officers to take the votes of the mayor and council,\r\nand bring back to the commonalty the name of the elected mayor.\r\n\r\nThe election of all other municipal officers was carefully divided\r\nbetween the two parties in the state. The mayor and the twenty-four\r\nelected the common clerk, one sheriff, one chamberlain, one treasurer,\r\none coroner, two keepers of the keys, two auditors, and eight\r\nconstables. The common council chose the common speaker, a second\r\nsheriff, chamberlain, treasurer, and coroner, two keepers of the keys,\r\ntwo auditors, and eight constables. The whole assembly appointed the\r\ncommon serjeant, the recorder, the bell-man, and the ditch-keeper; they\r\nalso chose the men who were to gather in the king’s taxes, appointing\r\nfour men in each ward to assess the tax and two to collect it. The\r\nnew mayor named two sword-bearers, of whom the assembly chose one; in\r\nthe same way the mayor nominated four persons for serjeants, and the\r\nassembly chose two of them.[755] Members of Parliament were chosen by\r\nthe common assembly.\r\n\r\nThus the commons of Norwich made their decorous entry on the official\r\nstage, with a punctilious care to secure their dignity and make fast\r\ntheir liberties by countless ceremonial ligatures. The Composition\r\nwhich vindicated their right against the oligarchy proved, however,\r\nlike the Ordinances of 1404, a hard saying to many; and disputes\r\nbetween the mayor’s council and the commonalty were so violent[756]\r\nthat the citizens appealed to Henry the Fifth in 1417 for a charter\r\nwhich should make the late agreement legally binding. The mayor’s\r\ncouncil no doubt brought influence to bear in high places, for their\r\nposition was now somewhat bettered. By the charter, for which the\r\ncity had to pay over £100,[757] the twenty-four, now first called\r\naldermen, got rid of one serious difficulty in their way by securing\r\nthe clause that they “shall stand perpetually as they do in London,”\r\nand henceforth the old ceremony of annual election was simply recalled\r\nby the custom of reading out the names every year before the wards.\r\nIn the composition it had been settled that in making “new ordinances\r\nfor the welfare of the city that come not now to mind it is committed\r\nto the whole assembly thereon to ordain by ordinance and assent of the\r\nwhole commonalty,”[758] but the new charter decreed that the mayor and\r\naldermen should have full power to amend the laws and constitution with\r\nassent of the sixty of the common council.[759]\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the century the government of the city[760] remained\r\nof this pattern. The four great leets which had once elected the\r\nbailiffs now became the four wards, and were ultimately divided into\r\ntwelve small wards. Each of these was represented in the upper council\r\nby two aldermen chosen for it by the electors of its own great ward.\r\nEach great ward also elected a fixed proportion of the members of\r\nthe common council. The sheriffs held their “tourns” for the four\r\nwards, and appointed for each ward a jury drawn from the “men of good\r\nname and fame.” Meanwhile the leet courts of the sub-divisions over\r\nwhich the bailiffs used to preside carried on an obscure and feeble\r\nexistence, and the capital pledges which formed the leet juries sank\r\ninto insignificance[761] under the combined usurpations of the sheriffs\r\nand the two councils. Once when the capital pledges attempted to\r\nsecure to the small trader some advantage in landing their goods at a\r\nstaith where apparently they escaped some city tolls, the governing\r\nbody promptly repressed their insubordination.[762] Evidently the\r\nadministration of the city was neither more lax nor more popular\r\nbecause its governing body was enlarged.\r\n\r\nIn the obscure years of conflict between 1378 and 1415 we are told\r\nnothing about the men or the organizations of men that made the\r\nrevolution. But we know that a very important movement was going on\r\nin Norwich itself in the growth of the craft guilds. Long forbidden\r\nby the civic government because of the loss to the city chest when\r\nthe craftsmen were withdrawn from the common courts, they apparently\r\nmade matters easy for themselves by regular payment of fines, and\r\ncontinued to flourish.[763] Between 1350 and 1385[764] a number of\r\nguilds were either founded or reconstituted so as to obtain public\r\nrecognition in the city,[765] and the one fact that we catch sight of\r\nin their ordinances amid the absolutely monotonous and formal recital\r\nof religious duties, is that they were in some cases allowed to choose\r\ntheir own aldermen and council, instead of being subjected as before\r\nto the twenty-four. The importance of this is at once evident in the\r\nordinances of 1404, where the guilds take a very prominent place; and\r\nin the composition of 1415, when they were finally sanctioned and given\r\na completed form.[766] Not only was the power of choosing their own\r\nofficers granted to every trade, but it was decreed that “citizens\r\nof the city shall be enrolled of what craft he be of” on pain of\r\nforfeiture of his franchise; and that all “that shall be enfranchised\r\nfrom this time forth shall be enrolled under a craft and by assent of\r\na craft.” Such a rule practically made the craft-masters the judges of\r\na new candidate for the city privileges, for if they refused to admit\r\nhim to the guild he could never become a burgess.[767] On the other\r\nhand it was commanded that all the members of a craft must become\r\nfreemen; foreigners were to hold shops under tribute and fine for two\r\nyears and a day, and were then forced to buy the franchise of the\r\ncity. “The master of the craft shall come honestly to him and give him\r\nwarning to be a freeman or else spear in his shop-window.” If he did\r\nnot obey within fourteen days the master with an officer of the mayor\r\nagain visited him with his spear, “and he so speared in, nor no other,\r\nshall not hold his craft within house nor without.” Thus no trader or\r\nshopkeeper could remain exempt from the dues and charges of the city,\r\nand the whole commonalty was placed under the police supervision of the\r\ncraft masters. The very dress of the crafts was made a matter of strict\r\ndefinition; all liveries and hoods of former days were to be given up,\r\nand the crafts were to wear liveries the same as those of London.[768]\r\n\r\nIf, however, during the years of conflict the craft associations may\r\nhave done good service to the commonalty, they were met by a counter\r\norganization of the merchants and upper class. It seems to have become\r\ncommon after the Peasant revolt, when a new terror was stirred as to\r\nwhat the poor commons might do if left to follow their own will and\r\nappetite, for the richer sort to unite for self-protection and the\r\npreservation of their authority. In Norwich a Guild of S. George was\r\nfounded in 1385 as a fraternity with the usual religious colour, and\r\na - “going each Monday about in the city remembering and praying for\r\nthe souls of the brethren and sisters of the said guild that be passed\r\nto God’s mercy.”[769] At first an informal body, consisting apparently\r\nof the wealthier and more powerful people, both lay and ecclesiastic,\r\nof Norwich and the surrounding country, its weakness lay in the fact\r\nthat it was “desevered by constitutions and ordinances made within the\r\ncity,” and according to the old rule by which the formation of any\r\nguild was forbidden, it was, in fact, an illegal body. The governing\r\nclass, however, probably enlisted considerable sympathy at court in\r\nthe negociations for the charter of 1417; and the associates of S.\r\nGeorge won from Henry the Fifth in 1418 permission to constitute\r\nthemselves into a permanent society, and received a sword of wood\r\nwith a carved dragon’s head to be carried before their alderman on S.\r\nGeorge’s day.[770] The great people of the county and their wives\r\nentered the order, bishops, monks and rectors, counts, knights, and\r\nmerchants—something like four hundred of them—all men of substance\r\nwho rode on horseback to the guild assembly, where the uniform of\r\nS. George was varied by the mayors, sheriffs, aldermen, or masters\r\nof crafts, riding in the garments of their order. The government of\r\nthe society was put in the hands of a very close corporation, and\r\nthe alliance between Church and State in the guild is manifested by\r\nthe association of the prior, mayor, and sheriffs of the city in its\r\ngovernment.[771]\r\n\r\nThe real danger of such a fraternity lay in the peculiar position\r\nof Norwich, and the impossible task of local government which had\r\nbeen thrown on its burghers. Beyond the city territory lay a great\r\nmanufacturing district—a whole county studded with villages where\r\nweaving and worsted making were carried on in every house—and over all\r\nthis district Norwich had the supervision of the woollen trade. The\r\ndifficulties of the arrangement by which, in 1409, at the request of\r\nthe commons, the mayor, sheriffs, and commonalty were granted the right\r\nof measuring and sealing all worsteds made in Norwich or Norfolk,[772]\r\nmust have been extreme. The great employers settled in the city who\r\norganized the country labour and supplied cloth for the export trade\r\nwere thus given a certain judicial authority in the county; while\r\nthe great wool sellers—land-owners whose vast flocks of sheep[773]\r\npastured on the broad downs of undulating chalk, and who were turning\r\ninto traders on their own account—were forced in their own interest to\r\nmeddle with Norwich politics. Besides the general commercial questions\r\nwhich affected both city and county, there must have been many a vexed\r\nquestion as to the tenants who owed suit and service to the courts of\r\ntheir lords, but who as artizans were subject to Norwich rule and whose\r\nfines were swept into the Norwich treasury. On every hand the door was\r\nthrown open to trouble. If the Norwich corporation was to busy itself\r\nin county affairs, the county was bound to exert some control over\r\nthe Norwich corporation, whether by guilds of St. George, by securing\r\noffice in Norwich for sympathetic mayors, recorders, or sheriffs, by\r\nwinning the help of the Earl of Suffolk or of bishop or prior, by\r\nchoosing the Norwich members for Parliament, or if all other means\r\nfailed, by bribery and violence and the stirring up of street factions.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view, therefore, the story of the long years of\r\nstrife and calamity which followed the reformation of the Norwich\r\nconstitution in 1415 is singularly interesting. In presence of a\r\nforeign foe internal dissension is suppressed, and the main story is\r\nno longer, as in Nottingham, that of a struggle between the two classes\r\nof the community itself. When a mayor of alien interests is imposed on\r\nNorwich by a foreign faction he stands alone, and aldermen and commons\r\nhold apart from him as betrayer of the common interests. The enemies\r\nwhom Norwich had to fear came from without the community itself, and if\r\nthe story of the city remained a singularly troubled one, the troublers\r\nof its peace were not those of its own household. Factions of the State\r\nand factions of the shire flung confusion into the city politics, and\r\nthe old burning question of ecclesiastical rights embittered every\r\nlocal dispute.[774] Norwich was befriended by the Duke of Gloucester\r\nand had a persistent enemy in the Earl of Suffolk, and its fortunes\r\nswung backwards and forwards with the rise and fall of court parties.\r\nFrom the day when the recorder, John Heydon, betrayed the city into\r\ntheir hands, the county despots whom we know so well in the Paston\r\nLetters, meet us in its streets and assembly hall, ever followed by\r\nthe curses of the people. Heydon of Baconsthorpe, Esq., sheriff in\r\nNorwich in 1431, and recorder from 1441-3,—the man whose putting away\r\nof his wife had created such a scandal that the very mention of it made\r\nhim turn pale, the land-jobber, the smuggler of wool, the exactor of\r\nbribes, the parasite of the great lords whose support he could buy, the\r\norganizer of outrages and murder, the audacious schemer willing to\r\nspend two thousand pounds rather than lose the control of the Norwich\r\nsheriff, the patron of liveried followers, the “maintainer” in the\r\ncourts of men who defied the law, the overbearing bully whose very\r\npresence was enough to cow the commons into refusing to present their\r\ncomplaints to the king’s judges,[775]—can be pictured by every one\r\nwho tracks his tortuous ways through the letters of the Pastons. In\r\nconjunction with Sir Thomas Tuddenham and others he overwhelmed the\r\ncity with extortions, oppressions, and wrongs. These men “through their\r\ngreat covetousness and false might oppressed all such citizens as would\r\nnot consent to make such mayors and sheriffs as they liked,” “purposing\r\nfor great lucre to have as well the rule of the city of Norwich as they\r\nhad of the shire of Norfolk,”[776] and “trusting in their great might\r\nand power which they had and have in the country by the means of the\r\nstewardship of Lancaster and other great offices and for divers other\r\ncauses that no man at that time durst make resistance against them,\r\nknowing their great malice and vengeance without dread of God or shame\r\nof the world.” Even when the people sought to buy the favour of Sir\r\nThomas, he took their money “by briberous extortion against all faith\r\nand conscience,” and yet showed them no mercy.[777]\r\n\r\nIt is just possible that the danger to the city called into being a\r\nfraternity to confront the society of S. George, and that the burghers\r\nin their turn seized on the machinery of the religious guild. We catch\r\none passing glimpse of a curious association known as “Le Bachery”;\r\nwhich was declared by the mayor and commons to be merely a company of\r\ncitizens who out of pure devotion kept up a light in the chapel of the\r\nBlessed Virgin in the Fields (the ancient place for the assembly of the\r\npeople) and from mere motives of decency had chosen a livery; but in\r\nwhose pious and decent union the hostile fraternity saw an association\r\nfashioned to break the power of S. George, and made haste to use\r\nagainst it the old argument applied to its own youth—the charge of\r\nbeing an “illegal guild.”[778]\r\n\r\nThe association was founded in stormy days. After Heydon was turned\r\nout of office by the people for betraying their interests to the\r\nprior,[779] his friend of S. George’s guild, the mayor Wetherby, an\r\nally of Tuddenham and a “hater of the commons,” led the party of the\r\ncounty and the priory, and till his death fourteen years later the city\r\nknew no peace. Four times between 1433 and 1444 its franchises were\r\nforfeited for riot or stormy elections; twice the common seal was\r\nviolently taken out of the treasury by aldermen and commons to prevent\r\nthe sealing of proposals rejected of the people. Wetherby forced on the\r\nelection, as his successor, of a mayor refused by aldermen and commons.\r\nJohn Qwerdling, falsely pretending to be common speaker, had carried\r\nto the chamber a name not set down by the commons for election; Hawk\r\nthe town clerk had written down a wrong return; Nicholas Waleys had\r\ntaken bribes enough to win him the name of “ambidexter”; the two city\r\nserjeants had packed juries, and the gaoler had threatened and struck\r\nthe resisting commons on the head with his mace. The mayor’s faction\r\nheld the guild hall, while the aldermen’s party retired to a private\r\nhouse, and having elected another candidate, put the offending officers\r\nout of their places, took the common seal out of the guild hall into\r\ntheir own keeping, and lest by any chance their election should be\r\nheld invalid, refused to disperse till the mayor came down to confirm\r\nit, and called the bishop to join them in opposition to the prior. For\r\nthe moment Wetherby yielded, but revenged himself by applying for a\r\ncommission from the king to examine into the state of the city.[780]\r\nThe enraged citizens kept up the broil till 1436, when another\r\ncommission was appointed which forced the commons to submit, to restore\r\nthe seal to its accustomed place in the treasury, and to put back the\r\nofficers they had displaced in 1433.[781]\r\n\r\nAt the next election, in 1437, commissioners were sent by the privy\r\ncouncil to see that all was done in order according to the charter, and\r\nin case of riot to seize the franchises of the city into the king’s\r\nhand;[782] and thus quiet was secured. But Norwich was not to keep its\r\nrestored franchise long. Riots and daily disturbances “concerning their\r\nliberties” broke out between the city and the prior;[783] in June the\r\ninhabitants of Norwich had to appear before the Privy Council, and in\r\nJuly the franchises of the city were seized and the place committed\r\nto the custody of John Welles, a London alderman who was made citizen\r\nand alderman of Norwich.[784] At the prayer of the bishops of Norwich\r\nand Lincoln the liberties were once more restored in 1439, to be as\r\nquickly lost again.[785] For Thomas Wetherby “who bare a great hatred\r\nto the commons” watched for an opportunity of making fresh trouble.\r\nBy his counsel the abbot of S. Bennet’s at Holm prosecuted the city\r\nin 1441 for certain mills it had built on the Wensum; and Thomas\r\nTuddenham, John Fray, and William Paston (a friend of the abbot’s),\r\njudged the case at Thetford and gave it against the the city, ordering\r\nthe commons to pay £100 damages to the abbot and £50 to the prior. At\r\nthis the assembly gathered in great numbers, crowded to the hall, in\r\nJanuary, 1442, and took away the common seal that the award might not\r\nbe sealed. By the influence of the Earl of Suffolk, the abbot, and\r\nWetherby, the city was prosecuted for rebellion, and in spite of the\r\nprotection of the Duke of Gloucester the mayor was ordered to appear\r\nin London, where he was fined £50 and imprisoned in the Fleet, and the\r\nliberties of the city were again seized into the king’s hands. The\r\nmayor being thus fast in the Fleet, Wetherby got the common seal out of\r\nthe chest, sealed the bond of £100 to the abbot of S. Bennet’s at Holm,\r\n£50 to the bishop, and £50 to the prior, without the knowledge of the\r\nmayor, sheriffs, or commons; and then destroyed the new mills.[786]\r\n\r\nThis led to fresh troubles. On the Shrove Tuesday of 1443 the mayor\r\nand commonalty, at this time united in the mysterious guild of “Le\r\nBachery,” raised an insurrection, declaring they had power enough in\r\nthe city and adjacent country to slay Thomas Brown the bishop,[787]\r\nthe abbot of Holm, and the prior of Norwich. John Gladman, a merchant,\r\nrode with a paper crown as king at the head of a hundred and thirty\r\npeople on horseback and on foot. At the ringing of the city bells\r\nthree thousand citizens assembled, armed with swords, bows, arrows,\r\nand helmets, surrounded the priory, laid guns against it, and at last\r\nwon a glorious victory, and forced the monks to deliver up the hateful\r\ndeed falsely sealed with the common seal which bound the people to pay\r\n4_s._ a year to the prior and to abandon claims to jurisdiction over\r\ncertain priory lands.\r\n\r\nSuch a triumph was naturally followed by a fresh visit of royal\r\ncommissioners in 1444.[788] Wetherby and the prior brought a long\r\nlist of charges against the mayor;[789] while the city protested that\r\nTuddenham and Heydon alone had made mischief out of their peaceful\r\nshow; and that Gladman had only “made a disport with his neighbours,\r\nhaving his horse trapped with tynnsoyle and other nice disguisy things,\r\ncrowned as king of Christmas,” while “before him went each month\r\ndisguised after the season required, and Lent clad in white and red\r\nherring skins and his horse trapped with oyster shells after him.”[790]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the king had his own grievance against Norwich, for the city\r\nhad unluckily brought a suit for £100 which it had formerly lent him,\r\nand now refused to advance any more money when he sent to solicit\r\nit.[791] Once more, therefore, in 1444, its liberties and franchises\r\nwere confiscated. But now at last troubles began to lighten. Thomas\r\nWetherby died, as well as the bishop who had supported him,[792] and\r\nthe new bishop, of an old Norwich family, was for peace. In 1447 the\r\nliberties were restored, and in 1448 the king visited the city.[793]\r\nTwo years later however, Heydon was again to the front, ready with\r\nTuddenham to spend £2,000 in buying favour in high quarters in\r\nLondon, and £1,000 to secure a sheriff in Norwich committed to his\r\ninterest.[794] It was suggested that the Norwich folk, the mayor with\r\nthe aldermen and all the commons, should ride to meet the Duke of York\r\nwhen he visited the city, “and all the women of the same town be there\r\nalso, and cry out on them also, and call them extortioners, and pray\r\nmy Lord that he will do sharp executions upon them ... and let that be\r\ndone in the most lamentable wise, for Sir, but if my Lord hear some\r\nfoul tales of them, and some hideous noise and cry, by my faith they\r\nare else like to come to grace.”[795] The commission of judges[796]\r\nfinally sent to try Heydon for felony, his defiant ride through the\r\ntown into the abbey, the rumours that he was to bear rule once more,\r\nhis mode of meeting and outwitting or terrorising the commissioners\r\nby turns, all these are told from day to day almost in the Paston\r\nLetters. Finally, in 1452, Judge Yelverton arranged some kind of peace\r\nin Norwich,[797] helped possibly by the poverty and exhaustion of the\r\ncity.[798] By giving a loan to the king and a present to the queen with\r\na promise to befriend her in her anxieties, Norwich got a new charter\r\nin 1452.[799] In this the guild of S. George, which seems to have been\r\nunited to the corporation about 1450, was apparently victorious.[800]\r\nIt was agreed that the day after the mayor left office he should be\r\nchosen alderman of the guild, and the common council was taken into the\r\ncouncil of the guild.\r\n\r\nFor the next seventy years the citizens were occupied by strife with\r\nthe prior, which dated back to the day when the Norwich burghers were\r\ngiven the city into their hands.[801] The bickerings of three centuries\r\nended in a compact drawn up in 1524, when questions of jurisdiction,\r\ntolls, pasturage, water, and rights of way were settled; and it was\r\nadmitted that the mayor, sheriffs, citizens, and commonalty might\r\ngo to the cathedral church on feast days and occasions of solemn\r\nprocessions, the mayor with sword and maces borne before him, on\r\ncondition that he claimed no jurisdiction, while the prior and monks\r\n“of their amiable favour shall forbear as far as they lawfully can or\r\nmay” to arrest any of the corporation or the citizens during these\r\ngreat processions.[802]\r\n\r\nSuch stories of local wranglings might well be left forgotten and\r\nobscure if there lay in them nothing more than vulgar quarrels. But the\r\npolitical experiment of Norwich was one of such serious purpose and\r\nsuch singular quality, that even in its failure it kindles our sympathy\r\nwith men who for two hundred and fifty years had been laboriously\r\nworking out the problem of administration. With an admirable political\r\nsagacity they had used in turn every form of local organization to\r\nperfect their experiment in self-government. They had taken the\r\nprinciple of an elected jury and adapted it for use in their courts,\r\ntheir council chamber, and their legislative assembly. They had\r\nturned to the problem of the general assembly, altogether useless in\r\nits primitive and unwieldy form, and developed out of it (taking a\r\npattern from London) a representative council which should guide its\r\ndeliberations and express its will. The craft-guilds were organized,\r\nand it is possible that in the struggle their discipline gave order\r\nand strength to the commonalty. When the battle grew hot the machinery\r\nof the religious guild was brought into play on either side, and S.\r\nGeorge measured his force with the Virgin of the Fields. No doubt these\r\nvarious methods have no claim to originality, being frankly copied\r\nfrom customs known elsewhere; nor is it in the discovery of a new path\r\nthat the merit of the Norwich burghers lies, but in the sound political\r\ninstinct by which they steadily directed their way into the broad track\r\nwhose ultimate goal is civil freedom, rather than the narrow road of\r\nprivilege. As we watch the growth of the house of representatives\r\nwhich was established among them, an independent deliberative assembly\r\nelected by the commons; and compare it with the chamber of magnates at\r\nNottingham that by a fine mockery was supposed to typify a gathering\r\nof the whole community; we have a just measure given us of the value\r\nof this more liberal experiment in municipal politics—an experiment\r\nso early in time, so serious in conception, so strong and orderly in\r\nexecution, that it might have justified an enduring success.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all the ingenuity and sagacity and resolution which\r\nthe men of Norwich brought to their fine attempt at ordering public\r\nlife, misfortune still waited on their steps, and from the outset the\r\ndisaster of the fifteenth century darkens and throws long shadows.\r\nFor Norwich was fighting with its doom already proclaimed—harassed\r\nby the harsh dry climate in which fine cloth needed for the foreign\r\nmarket could not be woven; by the hurry of the new export trade which\r\ndrove masters to set up their mills by the streams of Yorkshire and\r\nGloucestershire, where labour was free and cheap; by changes in\r\nmethods of making worsted which shifted the manufacture over to the\r\nNetherlands; and by the false economy which to help a failing trade,\r\nmade English weavers refuse Norfolk yarn to foreign buyers—the Norwich\r\nburghers had still to endure the last calamity of pestilence, and\r\nthe sweating sickness, which first burst on them in 1485, filled up\r\nthe tale of disaster. Industrial difficulties alone might have been\r\nconquered. But a more insidious danger threatened all their liberties.\r\nBy a fatal accident of position and circumstances the city, as we have\r\nseen, had been invaded and conquered by the county—by a society wholly\r\nseparate from it in political developement. It had bitterly proved\r\nthe truth of the extreme apprehension with which men of the towns at\r\nthat time looked on the intrusion among them of “foreigners,” bringing\r\ninto their newly ordered civic life the feudal traditions of the\r\ncounty magnates, scattering liveries among their people, and pouring\r\ninto their law courts a commanding army of retainers—“because,” to\r\nuse their own words, “by such maintainers and protectors a common\r\ncontention might arise among us, and horrible manslaughter be committed\r\namong us, and the loss of the liberty or freedom of the city, to\r\nthe disinheritance of us and of our children; which God forbid that\r\nin our days by the defeat of us should happen or fall out in such a\r\nmanner.”[803] The story of Norwich shows that in a provincial town, as\r\nin a greater state, a constitution framed for home uses and needs may\r\nbe shattered by the violence of foreign affairs over which it has no\r\npower, against which it has no arms, and for the guidance of which it\r\nhas no instructions.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE A.\r\n\r\n Mr. Hudson believes that in Norwich the word “citizen” at first meant\r\n merely an enfranchised equal, being frequently described as “par\r\n civitatis,” and that from the thirteenth century onwards the most\r\n prominent idea which it imported was that of a privileged trader,\r\n in which sense it is used through the series of Leet Rolls. In one\r\n class of documents, however, at the close of the thirteenth century,\r\n he finds it apparently restricted to a limited body of substantial\r\n burghers, into whose hands the management of the public business had\r\n gradually passed. In enrolled deeds which have been examined for the\r\n years 1285-1298 a great number of persons are described merely as\r\n drapers, tanners, fishmongers and so on, while others are mentioned\r\n as “merchant citizen of Norwich,” or “tanner, citizen of Norwich,”\r\n and others again are put down simply as “citizen of Norwich.” Out of\r\n the hundred and fifty persons to whom the words “citizen of Norwich”\r\n are applied there are fifty who are apparently of no trade; and of\r\n the remaining hundred, thirty-two are merchants, twenty-four drapers\r\n and linendrapers, and the rest, about fifty, belong to a variety of\r\n occupations, but generally to the skilled handicrafts. No smith is\r\n mentioned as citizen, and very few among the butchers and bakers. From\r\n these facts the general conclusion is drawn that the word “citizen”\r\n was being gradually restricted by the most important burghers to\r\n themselves, the lower classes of those who held the freedom of the\r\n city being massed together as the “communitas.” (Arch. Journ. xlvi.\r\n No. 184, 318-319.)\r\n\r\n The argument, however, rests on entries made in the last years of the\r\n thirteenth century, between 1285 and 1298, at a time when the state of\r\n things in Norwich was exceptional. The city rule was that every man\r\n who bought and sold in Norwich should have “made his ingress” into the\r\n town and become of the “franchise” or “liberty.” How often the law\r\n was evaded we see from the presentments of the leet courts. (For the\r\n last ten years of the thirteenth century see Town Close Evidences,\r\n 12-15.) It would seem that as the prosperity of the city increased\r\n new inhabitants had begun to flock to it who were far more concerned\r\n in making their own bargains than in carrying out the laws and customs\r\n of the borough; and who, especially the poorer sort engaged in humble\r\n trades, were anxious to escape the payments and responsibilities\r\n of citizenship. Blomefield (iii. 73) states that about 1306, owing\r\n to difficulties in paying the ferm, it was ordered that every one\r\n who had traded for a year and a day in the city must take up his\r\n freedom, paying for it a fine of 40_s._ if he were not entitled to the\r\n franchise by birth or service. Since every citizen was bound to have a\r\n house, building went on fast, and can be measured by the increase of\r\n rents from houses. For “in 1329 Simon de Berford the King’s escheator\r\n on this side Trent gave the city much trouble concerning a number of\r\n houses, shops and tenements lately erected by grant of the city on\r\n the waste grounds of the said city, on pretence that all the waste\r\n belonged to the King and not to the citizens, and that the rents of\r\n all such buildings should belong to the Crown (Custom Book fo. 2) by\r\n which means great part of the city rents, namely all the rents _de\r\n novo incremento_ or new increased rents, would have been lost from the\r\n city to the value of £9 11_s._ 8_d._ a year, by which we may calculate\r\n the surprising increase of the inhabitants of this place from the\r\n beginning of Edward II. to this time. The small rents or old rents of\r\n houses erected upon the city waste from its original to Edward the\r\n Second’s time amounted to but 9_s._ 2_d._, so that if we compare the\r\n new increased rents with the old ones we shall find in about thirty\r\n years’ time nineteen times as many houses erected upon the waste as\r\n there were before, an argument sufficiently showing how populous it\r\n grew by its flourishing trade, and indeed its increase continued as\r\n surprisingly till that fatal pestilence in 1349.\r\n\r\n “To remedy this imposition the citizens sent to Thomas Butt and John\r\n Ymme, their burgesses in Parliament, then held at Winchester, to\r\n complain of the usage to the King and Parliament; upon which the King\r\n afterwards directed his writ to the said Simon, certifying him, that\r\n by the grants of his progenitors, Kings of England, the citizens held\r\n the city and all the waste ground by fee-farm, in inheritance, and\r\n that therefore he had nothing to do to molest them in letting out such\r\n void grounds to be built upon for their profit and advantage towards\r\n paying their fee-farm. This writ bears date at Reading March 25, in\r\n the 4th of his reign.” (Blomefield, iii. 80-1.)\r\n\r\n These facts seem to indicate that citizenship was a less frequent\r\n thing among the inhabitants of Norwich at the end of the thirteenth\r\n century than in the first half of the fourteenth century—and was at\r\n that time possibly confined in practice to those who gained it by\r\n birth or service, and that purchase was rare.\r\n\r\n For the very different law made by the Bishop of Norwich in 1307 for\r\n Lynn see p. 408. He may have desired to secure for Lynn the small\r\n traders who found themselves hard pressed by the Norwich decree of\r\n 1306.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON COUNCIL OF LYNN\r\n\r\n\r\nIT was not in Norwich alone that the people, refusing submission\r\nto a governing plutocracy, made the experiment of creating a lower\r\nhouse of commons to represent the burghers at large. The peculiar\r\ndifficulties that beset popular government in that city were absent\r\nin other towns, but in no case was the experiment a simple matter.\r\nEverywhere unforeseen dangers were presently disclosed, dangers new and\r\nvarious, and capable of overwhelming the new movement in ultimate ruin\r\nand confusion. Even at the moment when Norwich was forming its second\r\nchamber, the town of Lynn, but a very few miles away, was developing a\r\ncommon council wholly different in its origin and its constitution, and\r\nthreatened by occasions of failure and betrayal of which Norwich had no\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nThe case of Lynn is one of singular interest. Nowhere else in England\r\nwas there a corporation more wealthy, or more formidable from its\r\ncompact organization and great authority. On the other hand nowhere\r\nelse perhaps was there a community of “mean people,” burgesses and\r\nnon-burgesses, so prosperous, active, and united; sustained as they\r\nwere in every emergency by the effectual protection of their lord the\r\nBishop, who, in his jealousy of the governing class, was forced to\r\nbecome the ally of the subject people, and to make their cause his own.\r\nUnder these circumstances the conflict between the commons and the\r\nplutocrats who ruled over them had some original characteristics, and\r\nthe problem of church and state in Lynn emerges in a new and subtle\r\nform.\r\n\r\nThe ruling class of the town was from the first the governing body of\r\nthe Merchant Guild.[804] For here, as in other leading ports, it is\r\nevident that the rich traders quickly became dominant in civic affairs,\r\neven though their association in a Guild Merchant of itself gave them\r\nno right to govern. In Lynn a powerful merchant class must have been\r\nformed at a very early time. Through the town lay the one way by\r\nwhich Norfolk could be entered from the west; and its port was the\r\nonly outlet for the trade of seven counties. Lynn was therefore the\r\ncentre for the largest cattle market in the east of England, whence\r\nthe export trade drew supplies of wool and fells and hides;[805] its\r\nmiddlemen and merchants held in their hands the commerce with Gascony,\r\nthe Rhineland, Zealand, “the parts of North Berne,” with Prussia, and\r\nDacia, and the Hanse towns; and as early as 1271 the German merchants\r\nhad some sort of local organization there under their alderman Symon,\r\na citizen of Lynn, of whom we hear that he gave a pledge on behalf of\r\nsome Lübeck merchants to the amount of £200.[806] No interest in the\r\nborough could compete with the great commercial company[807] by whom\r\nthe whole volume of trade that was borne over the waters of the Wash\r\n“rowing and flowing,” was ultimately controlled. Under the name of the\r\nHoly Trinity it had obtained a charter from John, and by the time of\r\nEdward the Second had nearly nine hundred names on its bede-roll. The\r\nsons of its old members were allowed to enter the guild on payment of\r\n6_s._ 8_d._; while others, men and women, were willing to give 60_s._\r\nor 100_s._ to be counted among its brethren, the men looking to share\r\nin the political as well as commercial benefits it offered, while women\r\nwere perhaps consoled with its spiritual gains; and men and women alike\r\npaid the same entrance fee to be enrolled after death in consideration\r\nof the eternal advantages of such membership.[808] In 1392 the guild\r\nemployed thirteen chaplains yearly to say masses in the churches of\r\nS. Margaret, S. Nicholas, and S. James, used much wax for lights in\r\nchurches and chapels, and from the profits of the common staith gave\r\nalms and fulfilled works of charity.[809]\r\n\r\nThe spiritual blessings of the guild, however, pale before the\r\nfinancial and political boons it had to offer. As a great trading\r\ncompany it heaped up wealth and increased power. The aldermen and\r\nhis brethren made laws to regulate the commerce even of those\r\nburgesses who did not belong to their select company, but carried on\r\nbusiness by virtue of the charter of free trade granted to the whole\r\nborough.[810] The guild owned along with other property the common\r\nstaith and all its appurtenances, the quay where by its decree “no bad\r\npersons, nor any spiritual persons should work,”[811] and the right\r\nof passage for a boat beyond the port.[812] The monopoly of various\r\nprofitable trades was secured to its members, as for instance the\r\nsale of mill-stones,[813] paving-stones, and grave-stones which were\r\nsold at from 20_s._ to 30_s._ apiece. The brethren of the guild were\r\nthe bankers and capitalists of the town.[814] They lent money out on\r\nusury, and not only did the corporation come to borrow from their\r\ntreasury, but in 1408 more than fifty townsmen were in their debt for\r\nsums varying from £1 to £119. The trading activity of the company may\r\nbe measured by the fact that in 1392 the guild had in ready money £60\r\n13_s._, and in divers merchandise £200;[815] and in 1408 the loans\r\ncame to £1,214. In 1422 its wealth was £1,403, of which the debts due\r\nto it made up £1,210. Its expenditure was generous and magnificent.\r\nLarge sums were spent on the new guild hall, beginning in 1422 with\r\n£132 4_s._ The silver plate in its treasury weighed in the first half\r\nof the century 440 ounces. A silver wand was borne before its dean; and\r\nits members were carried to their graves under a covering of cloth of\r\ngold.[816]\r\n\r\nFinancial transactions on such a scale as this would in any case\r\nhave given the guild control over a town government whose expenses\r\nwere fast increasing, and which in every time of need turned to its\r\ncoffers for money. But the company of the Holy Trinity exerted far\r\nmore than an indirect authority over the corporation. It was in effect\r\nitself the real governing force in Lynn. By a charter of Henry the\r\nThird its alderman (who held office for life and was thus absolutely\r\nindependent of popular control) was joined with the mayor in the rule\r\nand government of the borough: in case of the mayor’s absence or death\r\nhe was appointed in his stead,[817] and in the election of a new mayor\r\nhe took the leading part.[818] Moreover, the twenty-four jurats of\r\nthe council, who had the control of all town business, and from among\r\nwhom alone the mayor might be chosen, were bound to be brethren of\r\nthe guild. Under these conditions the “Potentiores”—the “great men\r\nof the town”—as they were commonly called in the time of Edward the\r\nFirst, ruled without restraint, and with a high hand assessed taxes,\r\ndiverted money from the common treasury, profited by illegal trading,\r\nused customs contrary to common or merchant law, and bought the\r\nking’s forgiveness if any complaint was made of their crimes. Against\r\ntheir despotism there was no protection for the burgesses of humbler\r\nstation—the middle class which went by the name of Mediocres, and the\r\nyet lower layer of the people known as the Inferiores, traders and\r\nhouseholders who were not burgesses, and whose prosperity, if fairly\r\nwell established, was of a less brilliant character than that of the\r\nupper classes.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, a disturbing element in the history of the Lynn\r\ncorporation which was absent in Southampton, Nottingham, or Norwich.\r\nThe lord of the manor was close at hand, and the governing class had\r\nto reckon with his claims and expect his interference. Local disputes\r\nmagnified his power. Thrown together as natural allies against the\r\npotentiores, the mediocres and inferiores were forced to rely mainly\r\non the protection of the Bishop. He on his part, whether for the sake\r\nof developing the trade of his borough, or for the sake of increasing\r\nthe population dependent on himself rather than on the rival power of\r\nthe mayor, stipulated—and this at the very moment when Norwich was\r\ncompelling all its traders and artizans to buy its freedom—that the\r\nmayor should not have power to force the franchise on any settlers\r\nold or new who might take up house in the town while preferring to\r\nremain free of the charges of citizenship. He won from the mayor,\r\nmoreover, in 1309, a Composition for the protection of both mediocres\r\nand inferiores, which not only became the charter of all their\r\nfuture liberties, but was also the fullest recognition of his own\r\nauthority.[819] From this time, in spite of efforts on the part of the\r\nmunicipality to evade the composition, the mean people, confident of\r\ntheir legal position and assured of the support of a powerful patron,\r\nformed a society differently compacted from that which we find in other\r\nboroughs, and played a part in the politics of Lynn which was perhaps\r\nunique in town history. The “community” of Lynn differed from the\r\n“community” of other boroughs in being made up, as is formally stated\r\nin 1412, not only of burgesses, both potentiores and mediocres, but\r\nalso of inferiores[820] or non-burgesses.\r\n\r\nThe first detailed account of the constitution of Lynn is given in\r\nLetters Patent of Henry the Fifth in 1417, where the “ancient custom”\r\nwhich ruled the town was recapitulated.[821] When a mayor was to\r\nbe elected the alderman of the guild appointed four “worthy and\r\nsufficient” burgesses, who added to themselves eight comburgesses, and\r\nthis jury of twelve elected one of the twenty-four jurats as mayor, and\r\nappointed the other municipal officers for the coming year.[822] The\r\ncouncil of twenty-four jurats, which was drawn wholly from the ranks of\r\nthe merchant guild and elected for life, filled up its own vacancies,\r\nso that when any one of them died or resigned his office or was\r\nexpelled, the townsfolk appeared as mere spectators in the hall, while\r\nthe mayor and remaining jurats chose “one of the more worthy, honest,\r\ndiscreet, and sufficient” of the burgesses to fill the vacant place.\r\nIf it became necessary to elect any other officers the mayor nominated\r\nfour comburgesses, who named in their turn eight others to form a jury.\r\n\r\nIn later days it was supposed that so long as these ordinances were\r\nobserved “mayor, jurats, burgesses, and community, rested happily under\r\nthe sweetness of peace and quiet throughout the days of prosperous\r\ntimes.”[823] Prosperous times there had certainly been[824] if we judge\r\nby the growth of the town’s budget. In 1354 the corporation spent £176;\r\nin 1355 £94; in 1356 £266; in 1357 £92; in 1367 £165; in 1371 £163;\r\nin 1374 £249. The year 1377 was very costly to the burghers, whose\r\nexpenses suddenly mounted to £874. It was the year of the quarrel\r\nwith the Bishop of Norwich,[825] and Lynn had to give £318 15_s._\r\nto the king, his mother, and others “labouring for the community”\r\nwhen the Bishop laid his complaint before the council “for a certain\r\ntransgression done to him in the town”; and to pay £116 10_s._ for the\r\nexpenses of the mayor, aldermen, and burgesses who went to London on\r\nthe same business. They were required further this year to spend £113\r\non making an enclosure for the defence of the town; and £103 10_s._ on\r\na town barge, doubtless fitted out at the king’s demand to serve as a\r\nwar vessel. All this naturally ended in a heavy debt; the corporation\r\nhad only been able to raise £650 6_s._ 2_d._ and had to borrow £160\r\nfrom the guild, and to leave the salaries of the mayor, clerk,\r\nserjeants, and chamberlains unpaid. The next year, however, it made an\r\neffort to clear off its debt and actually spent nearly £773, paying off\r\n£241 10_s._ to its creditors. From this time expenditure grew fast. In\r\n1380 it was £351, and in 1382 £204; in 1385 £304; in 1389 £394; in\r\n1399 £461.[826] In 1403 the borough had to lend to the king over £333\r\nwhich was not repaid till 1425.[827]\r\n\r\nThe municipal debt of course grew as fast as the municipal expenditure,\r\nand in 1408 the corporation owed the guild between £400 and £500.[828]\r\nThe council of jurats borrowed generously from the fraternity in their\r\ncapacity of town councillors, and lent as generously to the corporation\r\nin their capacity of members of the guild. The inevitable abuses which\r\nbelong to financial administration conducted on this system presently\r\nmade themselves felt. Perhaps there was an attempt at reform when in\r\n1402 changes were made in the manner of keeping and auditing accounts,\r\nand each of the four chamberlains had to return a separate statement\r\nof receipts and outgoings.[829] But if so the remedy was ineffectual,\r\nand for the state of Lynn, as for far bigger states, the question of\r\nfinance ended in a question of revolution, or was at last the pretext\r\nof revolution. The angry discontent of the community finally broke out\r\nin 1411, when the people demanded the repayment into the town treasury\r\nof a sum of £458, which the last five mayors had spent without the\r\nconsent of the community in litigation with the Bishop, to the serious\r\nprejudice and extreme depoverishment of the town. The five mayors on\r\ntheir side, at the head of the potentiores, retorted by claiming from\r\nthe town £280 to repay losses which they had incurred in its service\r\nduring their terms of office.\r\n\r\nThus the traditional “sweetness of peace” was at an end, and Lynn was\r\npresently plunged into the excitement of a revolution. Fortunately\r\nfor the people the ruling body found itself face to face with all its\r\nenemies at once; for the mediocres and inferiores, alike excluded from\r\nplaces of honour and power, were as of old drawn into close relations\r\nand were together thrown on the protection of their lord the Bishop for\r\nthe defence of their rights; while the Bishop himself, with whom the\r\nmunicipality had been dragging on a long quarrel for the last thirteen\r\nyears, was probably in no conciliatory mood. Everything, however,\r\nwas conducted on strictly constitutional lines. By common consent a\r\ncommittee of eighteen men of the town was appointed to deal with the\r\ngrievances of the state, and every section of the town society was\r\nrequired to give pledges of obedience to its decision. The mayor and\r\ntwenty-two potentiores bound themselves in sums of £100 each to submit\r\nto the decrees of the eighteen; eighty-four of the mediocres pledged\r\nthemselves in sums of £50 each; and sixty-six of the inferiores in\r\nsums of £5 11_s._ 2_d._ On the committee itself each of the three\r\nclasses that made up the community was represented. There were twelve\r\nburgesses, of whom seven were potentiores and five mediocres, and six\r\nnon-burgesses or inferiores.\r\n\r\nAt first all seemed to go well for the popular party. The decisions\r\nof the committee were eminently satisfactory. The compensation money\r\nwhich the late mayors had claimed was altogether refused; and they were\r\nordered to repay to the town treasury the £458 illegally spent without\r\nconsent of the community. A decree was made that henceforth the mayor\r\nshould only have, according to ancient custom, £10 for his year’s fee\r\nand whatever the community might put by for his reward having regard\r\nto his merit or demerit; and that he should answer to the town for all\r\narrears of contributions during his mayoralty. It was declared that\r\nthe non-burgesses had been deprived of the privileges secured to them\r\nby the composition of 1309, and an order was made that from this time\r\nthey “shall have and use all rights to the said inferiores granted.”\r\nThis was a declaration of ancient law and custom; but the committee\r\nwent further and began the process of “mending the constitution” by\r\nissuing a decree that for the future each mayor should choose and take\r\nto himself a council consisting of three potentiores, three mediocres,\r\nand three inferiores, which nine persons together with the mayor should\r\nhave full power to deal with the rents, etc., of the community.[830]\r\nBy these ordinances which mark the triumph of the alliance between the\r\nmediocres and inferiores with the lord of the manor behind them, just\r\nas the composition of 1309 had marked their triumph a century before,\r\nthe non-burgesses were formally given a share in the actual control of\r\nadministration—a circumstance which so far as published records go\r\nhas no parallel in the history of any other borough. The decrees were\r\nagreed to (how reluctantly was to be proved later) by the corporation\r\non April 8, 1411, and signed by persons chosen from the three orders of\r\ninhabitants;[831] in November, 1412, they were confirmed by Henry the\r\nFourth; and once more on April 10, 1413, by Henry the Fifth.[832]\r\n\r\nAt the same time, in 1411, the important question of elections was\r\nraised; and for the sake of securing to the commonalty a due share\r\nof power along with the alderman and his brethren, it was suggested\r\nthat “certain new ordinances and constitutions concerning and about\r\nthe elections of the mayor and the rest of the jurats, and officers,\r\nand ministers,” might be drawn up. The commons were to meet together\r\na week before the day of election, and choose from among themselves a\r\ncommon speaker—a prolocutor he was called in Lynn. All burgesses who\r\ndesired it might freely come to the guild hall for the election, and\r\nthe congregation having been made, after public proclamation that none\r\nbut a burgess or minister might give his vote,[833] they should choose\r\ntwo names from among the jurats, and from these two names the mayor\r\nand jurats were to select one as mayor. Throughout this proceeding the\r\nprolocutor and clerk were practically set to act as spies[834] on one\r\nanother in the interests of their several parties, the prolocutor\r\nguarding the people’s interest, and keeping watch at the elbow of the\r\ncommon clerk (the nominee of the mayor and jurats) as he went from\r\nburgess to burgess in the hall to inquire for whom they wished to vote,\r\nor as he carried the nominations to the mayor, and wrote down the\r\ndecisive votes of the upper chamber “severally and secretly.” In like\r\nmanner the election of the other officers was also regulated;[835] and\r\nabove all, the burgesses were, for the first time, given a share in the\r\nelection of the council of twenty-four, being allowed at every vacancy\r\nto nominate two candidates; if these were rejected they were again to\r\nchoose two other names, and so on until the jurats were satisfied. In\r\nits new constitution Lynn, like Norwich, decided to shape its system\r\nafter “the manner and form in which it was used in the city of London;”\r\nbut in Lynn there were special difficulties, and the new scheme could\r\nonly be brought “at least to the greatest possible conformity with\r\nthem of London, forsomuch that in the aforesaid town there are not had\r\naldermen, wards, recorder, nor divers other things as in the city of\r\nLondon.”[836]\r\n\r\nUnhappily for “the sweetness of peace” parties were so evenly matched\r\nin the committee of eighteen that the reforms were only passed by a\r\nmajority of one vote.[837] Moreover, the agreement—drawn up by the\r\ncommittee on April 8, 1411, set forth and assented to by the mayor\r\nand community in May, signed by their orders in July, and sealed with\r\nthe common seal in December—was not confirmed by charter till the\r\nfollowing November, 1412.[838] Thus, when the burgesses met on August\r\n27, 1411, to choose a new mayor, their ordinances were still but a\r\ncommon agreement and without any sanction of law if they were disputed.\r\nBurgesses and non-burgesses gathered in force, some three hundred or so\r\nstrong, to see what was going to happen. The question was raised as to\r\nwhat form of election should be used, and a proposal was made to delay\r\nthe business. But the mayor having put it to the meeting that all who\r\nwished to proceed with the election were to sit down and the others\r\nto rise up, all save six “suddenly as in a moment fell on the forms,\r\nbenches, and ground”; and a hundred and forty-eight burgesses insisted\r\non going on with the business. The next point was how the electing\r\njury was to be named, and the hundred non-burgesses present begged to\r\nhave “a little voice” in the matter, which was refused. The alderman\r\nof the guild and the inferiores having been thus set aside, the\r\nburgesses were left in possession of the field, and they proceeded,\r\nwith a compromise between the old and new systems, to nominate, as\r\nthe alderman had formerly done, the first four members of the jury,\r\ntwo jurats and two mediocres, who then added to themselves eight\r\nburgesses. In the following year the people again assembled, burgesses\r\nand non-burgesses together to the number of three hundred, in spite of\r\na notice on the rolls of process for “quieting these dissensions,” and\r\nagain carried out the elections after the new mode.[839]\r\n\r\nThe balance of forces, however, was too even to give the victors any\r\nsecurity of tenure, and government worked with great friction. It\r\nseems that the mayor of the popular party strengthened the radical\r\nvote by admitting to the franchise “foreign” inhabitants (probably\r\nsome of the inferiores) against the will of the council; while the\r\nreformers insulted the guild brethren in their own guild hall; and in\r\n1415 “without consent of the mayor and burgesses” quit-claimed the\r\ndebts of the town—debts owed, as we have seen, to the guild.[840]\r\nBy their enemies the new ordinances were declared to have “furnished\r\nthe fuel of grief and hatred,” and according to the malcontents the\r\nlate agreement had only caused “immense expenses, charges, losses, and\r\nintolerable damage by reason of discords, strifes, and other ills,” and\r\nmust inevitably “redound to the final destruction and pauperization,\r\nbut also the desolation and probable overthrowing of all that town.” In\r\n1416 an appeal was made to Henry the Fifth, whose sympathy here, as\r\nin Norwich at the same time, was with the oligarchy; and he summoning\r\nthe parties before him[841] ordered a final concord between them.\r\nTo “pluck up by the roots and extirpate strifes” the new ordinances\r\nwere utterly annulled, the former customs of the town recapitulated,\r\nand the old constitution restored. The alderman received again his\r\nancient position,[842] the jurats became once more a self-electing\r\nbody, and the town was subjected to the system dear to the potentiores,\r\nand against which the people had risen in vain. From this time the\r\nold method of election was resumed and carried on throughout the\r\ncentury.[843] Murmurs of discontent still seem to have been heard\r\noccasionally. In 1419 one of the townsmen challenged the alderman of\r\nthe guild at the election assembly. “We would know,” he said, “by what\r\nauthority or right you call up four persons to make our mayor”; but he\r\nwas put down by a speech about “our charter,” and after this meeting\r\nit would seem that the public were no longer admitted to the meetings\r\nof the corporation.[844]\r\n\r\nDefeated on the great issue of the election of the mayor and jurats,\r\nthe commons fell back on the idea of a chamber of representatives. An\r\nattempt had already been made, in 1411, to form a council of nine,\r\nwhich though appointed by the mayor was to be drawn from the three\r\norders of the community, and to act for them; but this scheme came to\r\nan end with the annulling of the ordinances. No sooner, however, was\r\nthe old power of the potentiores restored by Henry the Fifth than the\r\nidea of a common council immediately revived among the people, possibly\r\ninspired by the example of Norwich which had only a year before secured\r\nthe charter that gave its common council a permanent status. It was\r\ndecided that each of the nine constabularies or wards in Lynn should\r\nchoose three burgesses “having sufficient tenure in the town” who\r\nshould take part in all business concerning taxes, tenths, fifteenths,\r\nallowances, repairs of houses, walls, bridges, water-courses, ditches,\r\nall payments, rendering of accounts, and other charges of the borough.\r\nThis new body of twenty-seven became at once generally known as the\r\ncommon council, and was formally confirmed by the Bishop in 1420. The\r\ncommunity bound itself to obey any decree which was issued in the name\r\nof the two councils,[845] and from December, 1418, when the noble\r\njurats and the discreet burgesses met for the first time in the guild\r\nhall, the whole conduct of town business passed into their hands.[846]\r\nHenceforth decrees and ordinances were made with the assent of “the\r\nwhole congregation”;[847] but it is obvious that the institution of\r\nthe common council in this form marked the final separation between\r\nthe interests of the two lower classes of the community, and the\r\nirrevocable close of their alliance. As in 1411 the inferiores had\r\nbeen declared incapable of any share in electing officers, so now they\r\nremained without any part in legislation, while the mediocres entered\r\nhappily into their inheritance.\r\n\r\nSo the revolution of Lynn flickered out. For the new common council\r\ncannot be said to have represented after all a very formidable\r\nconcession to democratic demands. Unlike the council of 1411 it\r\napparently took no account at all of the inferiores. The electorates\r\nof the constabularies seldom numbered more than twenty people and\r\nsometimes as few as twelve, and the whole body which elected the new\r\ncouncil did not consist of more than a hundred and fifty persons.[848]\r\nTo prevent any trouble, moreover, there was a provision that if\r\nany man proved unfit, the mayor and aldermen and the councils of\r\ntwenty-four and twenty-seven might choose another in his place.[849]\r\nWith such safeguards the new representatives might be trusted to work\r\nin complete harmony with the older body; the potentiores had taken the\r\nmediocres into their counsels and formed an alliance with them, and the\r\ninferiores, left outside the door of the common hall, deserted by their\r\nold confederates, and dependent on a lord whose influence was steadily\r\non the decline, sank into obscurity and silence. In course of time the\r\njurats rose to the full dignity of an upper house, and effectually\r\nsecured in their own hands the whole administration of the nine\r\nconstabularies by an order (in 1480) that a jurat must be chosen as\r\nalderman in each constabulary, that the alderman and constable together\r\nshall keep the peace and settle debates, and that if they could not\r\nreduce rebellious persons to quiet, no burgess in that constabulary\r\nmight be suitor in any court, spiritual or temporal, without the leave\r\nof the mayor.[850] Finally, in 1524, the two ruling classes obtained a\r\ncharter which formed their corporation into a close self-elective body;\r\nthe mayor was to be elected by the twelve aldermen, and the twelve\r\naldermen by the common council, and the common council by the mayor\r\nand aldermen.\r\n\r\nIn the last state of the council we see the strength given to the upper\r\nclasses by a common alliance, by the humiliation of the non-burgesses,\r\nand by the increasing weakness of the lord of the manor. It would,\r\nhowever, be impossible to maintain that in Lynn a primitive democratic\r\ngovernment had been gradually submerged by a usurping oligarchy. If\r\nwe compare the demands put forward in 1309 by the inhabitants at\r\nlarge—demands for freedom of trade and some assurance that they should\r\nnot be unjustly taxed—with their claims a century later to be formally\r\nrepresented in the administration of the town, we see what strides had\r\nbeen made in that hundred years in the notion of popular government;\r\nand so far as it was not violently thwarted by alien influences the\r\nmovement of the early fifteenth century was in the direction of\r\nwidening liberty. In the new governing body more than twice as many\r\nmembers sat as in the old council of the potentiores, and two orders\r\nof the community were represented instead of one; while the commonalty\r\nlost none of the ancient customary rights which had originally belonged\r\nto it. The non-burgesses still made their appearance with the rest\r\nwhen taxes were to be levied or the common property allotted. In 1435,\r\nwhen the mayor was sent to Bruges as one of the king’s ambassadors on\r\ncommercial matters, his journey and its expenses are ordered “by the\r\nfull advice and assent of the twenty-four and the common council and\r\nof all the burgesses and merchants of Lynn.”[851] During the first\r\nyears of Henry the Sixth loans of money to the king and the receiving\r\nof re-payments was done in the name of and with the consent of the\r\nwhole community;[852] in 1448 arbitrators to decide on a disputed\r\nquestion about a tenement were in like manner elected by the whole\r\ncommunity;[853] and in the levying of taxes the whole three orders\r\nacted together as of old, so that in 1463, when a sum of £36 had to be\r\nraised, of the eighteen men chosen to assess the tax, six belonged to\r\nthe jurats, six to the common council, and six to the “communitas.”[854]\r\n\r\nStill, however, from the point of view of any real extension of\r\nliberty, the revolution had failed, and as in Norwich it had failed\r\nfrom purely external causes. The temporal sovereignty of the Church\r\nhad destroyed the political freedom of the State. From the time when\r\nthe Bishop had broken their society into two sections, which could\r\nnever again unite for civil purposes, an ecclesiastical tradition stood\r\nbetween the people and freedom. The crucial moment for liberty in Lynn\r\nhad occurred a century before, on that day in 1309 when the Bishop\r\nhad won from the corporation the right to create as a bulwark of his\r\npower a class of inhabitants protected in every material interest of\r\ntheir lives, but cut off from the body of free citizens, and carefully\r\ndebarred from political independence. For a time the system by which\r\na privileged class was allowed to buy the protection of the borough\r\nwithout paying the fair price, and to maintain a position within its\r\nwalls by the authority of a power without, seemed to work well for both\r\nparties to the cunning bargain—indeed, to offer certain advantages.\r\nDependent on the Bishop for all their rights of trade and privileges,\r\nthe inferiores were content to let him fight their battles, which he\r\ndid so effectually that the mediocres themselves were attracted to\r\ntheir party, and made common cause with them to the apparent profit\r\nof all concerned. But the only strength of a corrupt alliance utterly\r\nfalse in principle lay in the support given by the Bishop, and no\r\nsooner did this begin to fail than the whole scheme utterly collapsed.\r\nThe question of elections raised at the August meeting of 1411 gave\r\nthe potentiores their opportunity to break up the confederation from\r\nwithin by detaching the hundred or hundred and fifty mediocres from\r\nthe rest of the party of resistance, leaving the non-burgesses to\r\nshift for themselves; and when these, suddenly alive to their hapless\r\nsituation, tried to recover ground and begged to be taken into the\r\nfamily of citizen-voters, even by “a little voice,” there was no place\r\nfound for their repentance. The common council which the community had\r\nstriven to create finally represented only a handful of privileged\r\npeople instead of the general body of inhabitants, and any hope of the\r\npolitical developement of Lynn as a free community was once for all\r\narrested. The betrayal of the common cause of civic equality brought\r\nits exact recompense on the day when every weapon of the unenfranchised\r\ninhabitants was seen to be broken and useless. In the common assembly\r\nthey had no votes. In the common council they had no representatives.\r\nThe machinery of all their seventy-five guilds[855] could not in any\r\nway be so handled as to further the power of the people; for so long as\r\nthe great body of craft-holders and artizans lay outside the borough\r\nfranchise it was impossible for them to employ their organizations\r\nin the service of the common cause. Deprived of the close connection\r\nbetween the borough and the craft which existed in other towns, they\r\ncould neither aspire to send delegates from the trades into the council\r\nchamber, nor could they make the crafts the only way of entrance into\r\nthe freedom of the city.\r\n\r\nThe main result of this breaking up of the “communitas” of Lynn into\r\nthree fractions which could never again be united, was the final\r\naffirmation of power in the hands of a small ruling class. In Lynn it\r\nwas always the merchants who conquered. One by one they vanquished\r\ntheir opponents, the Church, the mediocres, the inferiores. A singular\r\nand pathetic unity pervades the history of the town from first to last.\r\nLynn had won from land and sea a little space of ground, a little\r\ntenure of life, and there, lighted by a passing gleam of beneficent\r\nfortune, it made its brief experiment—a single experience consistent\r\nfrom first to last, and scarcely subjected to accident or change. The\r\nold borough still retains some subtle charm of a lingering distinction.\r\nEven now as we look at the homes of its last traders—the heavy double\r\ndoors which shut off the great court from the street, the houses\r\nbuilt round three sides of the open square, and lifted at the back\r\nstraight out of the waters of canals cut to give passage to the ships\r\nand barges which drifted up on every rising tide, almost brushing as\r\nthey passed the windows that opened on rich chambers dark with carved\r\nwork in wood—we seem to breath the strange air of a remote place and\r\ntime in which this old city of dead merchants lies ever steeped. The\r\nvery fashion of the place still affirms perpetually that when the end\r\ncame the ancient rulers of Lynn made a proud exit, bequeathing their\r\nheritage to none, and leaving their silent dwellings to suffer indeed\r\nthe presence of strangers, but with no pretence of acquiescing welcome.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON COUNCIL OF SANDWICH\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE attempt in various boroughs to create a municipal house of commons\r\nfor the protection of popular liberties is so striking a fact in the\r\ntown history of the fifteenth century that, for the sake of again\r\nobserving the experiment under a new set of conditions, we may take\r\none last example of the building up of a representative council. The\r\ncase of Sandwich differs considerably from that either of Norwich or\r\nof Lynn, though one significant fact is common to all three boroughs.\r\nIn each of these towns the effort to work out the new constitution was\r\nfrustrated; and, singularly enough, it was frustrated in every case,\r\nnot by any evidence of inherent weakness in the scheme itself, but by\r\nthe operation of external and accidental causes. In Norwich the system\r\nwas possibly wrecked by difficulties in the working of what we may call\r\nforeign affairs—that is by the ill-defined and impossible relations\r\nof the town to the country, when the town claimed to interfere with\r\ninterests over which its authority was limited, while these interests\r\nhad no regular representation in its councils, so that intrigue came\r\nin to replace recognized and orderly influence, and the natural\r\ndistinctions of parties within the town were submerged in factions more\r\nor less external and artificial, and in the corrupt political ambitions\r\nto which these gave opportunity. In Lynn an equally artificial state\r\nof parties was created and maintained by the miniature strife between\r\nthe Church as a temporal power and the civil government. The existence\r\nof a large body of commons delivered by the Bishop from taking up the\r\njust burdens of citizenship, as dependents on his protection, withdrawn\r\nfrom a full share in the responsibilities of their fellow-townsmen\r\nand used as a sort of occupying army for the maintenance of his\r\nrights over the borough, was fatal to the healthy developement of\r\nmunicipal self-government. But in Sandwich an altogether new problem\r\nis suggested—the problem of local self-government in the members of a\r\nconfederated state, in which the several communities might tend towards\r\ndemocracy while the central administration remained the stronghold of\r\naristocratic tradition.\r\n\r\nFor Sandwich must not be considered as if it stood alone like Norwich,\r\nindependent and self-contained. Under the constitution of the Cinque\r\nPorts, as we have seen, certain weighty matters, such as military\r\ndefence, finance, foreign trade and foreign traders, the higher matters\r\nof justice, and so on, were under a central government represented\r\neither at Dover or at the Brodhull, and the several towns were mainly\r\nconcerned with local affairs. It is possible that in the conduct of\r\ndaily business of a comparatively simple kind there was less necessity\r\nthan in the greater boroughs for the supremacy of experts, and\r\napparently administration did not so soon harden into the despotism of\r\nan oligarchy. There was much, moreover, which was favourable to popular\r\nmovements in the general conditions of Kent and Sussex, which, even\r\nas early as the twelfth century, were centres of important mining and\r\nmanufacturing industries, and in whose midst there arose more than once\r\nmovements of liberal and radical thought like those which in our days\r\nhave come from the coal-fields and iron mines of the north. The trading\r\nvessels which put out from the ports across the German Ocean kept\r\nthe people in constant touch with the commercial towns of the north\r\nEuropean coast where municipal life was most vigorous and enduring. And\r\nof the strangers to whom Sandwich gave shelter, till at last almost a\r\nthird of its streets were occupied by foreigners, the main body were\r\ntraders or artizans from the Netherlands who, wherever they sought\r\nrefuge after their desperate battle against oligarchy in their own\r\ncountry, must have carried with them their sturdy creed of independence\r\nand freedom of political discussion, and would have inevitably\r\nranged themselves on the popular side of town politics, whether as\r\nenfranchised voters or as unenfranchised talkers.\r\n\r\nThus the men of the Cinque Ports long preserved a fine tradition of\r\nvigorous independence; and in Sandwich, as in the other ports, the\r\nburghers actually maintained in practice something of the early\r\ndemocratic theory of government. The mayor, jurats, and other officers,\r\nelected by the whole commonalty,[856] carried on the administrative\r\nand judicial work, but when a question arose as to the making of new\r\nlaws or the granting of cesses the whole people were called together\r\nto a hornblowing,[857] and “the mayor and commonalty at a common\r\nassembly may make such decrees as they think proper.” Any gathering\r\nof freemen, no matter how small, who assembled with the mayor,\r\nwas “deemed a meeting of the whole body,” and its ordinances were\r\nconsequently binding; but the mayor might send the common wardman, or\r\nwhom he pleased, to shut up all the windows of cellars and shops and so\r\nforcibly persuade dealers and artizans to join the congregation.[858]\r\n\r\nThis mode of government by a single council of twelve checked by the\r\n_referendum_ lasted unchanged till the middle of the fifteenth century;\r\nand it was certainly less difficult for the system that in larger\r\nboroughs so quickly developed into the rule of a plutocracy, to keep\r\nits democratic character in a small community which had only increased\r\nfrom the three hundred and eighty-three inhabited houses of the\r\nConqueror’s time to four hundred and twenty households in 1565,[859]\r\nand in which the forces that made for freedom and popular government\r\nwere strong. It would seem indeed that the mayor’s difficulty was not\r\nso much to force the freemen to fulfil their civic duties, as to check\r\nthe too active zeal of inhabitants not enfranchised, and Sandwich\r\nhad to reiterate its laws that only free “barons,” indwellers, and\r\nhouseholders, should attend at elections, and at last had to inflict on\r\nany offender a fine of 21_d._ and the loss of his upper garment.[860]\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the fifteenth century, however, there was a movement\r\nto amend the primitive constitution of the town. The first change was\r\nprobably intended to bring Sandwich into harmony with the prevailing\r\nfashion. In 1437 its eight wards were made into twelve, and a jurat\r\nsat over each, with power to appoint every year his own constable and\r\ndeputy constable.[861] Other reforms followed under the auspices of\r\nRichard Cok, who was mayor five times in thirteen years, and who was\r\nagain chosen for the sixth time in 1470 to make peace with Edward the\r\nFourth after his triumph over Henry the Sixth.[862] During his first\r\nmayoralty (in 1441) an order was issued that no one might sit on the\r\nbench at court but the mayor, the jurats, and the king’s bailiff; in\r\nother words the dignity of the upper chamber was asserted, and all\r\nintrusion and interference with its consultations made impossible.\r\nThe increasing authority of the council was immediately met by an\r\norganization of the commons to protect their own interests, such as\r\nwe have seen at Norwich and Lynn half a century earlier. During Cok’s\r\nfifth term of office, in 1454, a representative council of seventy\r\ncommons was formed, who, with the consent of the mayor and jurats, were\r\nto make all manner of elections and all scots and lots. In this way\r\nabout one citizen householder out of every six was given a share in the\r\ngovernment—a scheme so different from that of either Norwich or Lynn\r\nthat it suggests how far Sandwich must have outstripped those towns in\r\nthe habit of popular government.\r\n\r\nFrom this time we can trace a steady conflict between the two parties\r\nin the town, the official or governing class and the commonalty. The\r\ncommon council was remodelled ten years later, in 1464, and its members\r\nreduced to thirty-six. It is very probable that this change was brought\r\nabout by the policy of the governing class; for at the same time the\r\nmayor and jurats set up a claim to be the authoritative judges of the\r\nfitness of men sent by the commonalty to serve as councillors, and it\r\nwas ordained that the people should henceforth nominate forty-eight\r\npersons, sixteen out of each parish, and that the mayor and jurats\r\nshould then choose thirty-six of these to be of the common council.\r\nTheir triumph, however, was short, for in 1471, immediately after\r\nCok’s last mayoralty, the controlling choice of mayor and jurats was\r\nset aside, and it was decided that the commonalty should elect for\r\nthemselves, without any interference or dictation, twelve men from\r\neach of the three parishes to be of the common council, to consult\r\nwith the mayor and jurats “whenever the mayor pleases” for the benefit\r\nand utility of the town, and to make and establish decrees for its\r\nprofit.[863]\r\n\r\nFor over half a century the democratic party had their way. Popular\r\nrepresentation was recognized as part of the Sandwich constitution, and\r\nso far as the town itself was concerned, it would seem that liberal\r\nideas of government and civic freedom prevailed in a far greater degree\r\nthan in either Norwich or Lynn. All went well till the time of Henry\r\nthe Eighth. Then a singular danger declared itself, and the story of\r\nthe sixteenth century is that of the ruin of popular liberties in\r\nSandwich. The governing class had in each of the Cinque Ports a source\r\nof peculiar strength. Out-numbered and out-voted as they might be in\r\neach separate port, they reigned supreme in the Brodhull court, where\r\ntheir majority was certain, and where they could carry matters with a\r\nhigh hand; and it was there that the governing bodies of the various\r\nports, all alike threatened with public criticism of their acts and\r\nlimitation of their powers, formed a combination for the protection of\r\ntheir common interests. All devices to establish freely elected common\r\ncouncils, or any representative bodies to express popular opinion,\r\nreceived their quietus at the Brodhull court in 1526. The respectable\r\nassembly of mayors, jurats, and delegates there gathered passed a\r\nresolution that the duties of electing the mayor and jurats, receiving\r\nthe king’s bailiff, and appointing the bailiffs to Yarmouth, should\r\nbe given over in each port to a committee of thirty-seven persons;\r\nand in each corporate town to a body of twenty-four, who were to be\r\nnominated by the mayor and jurats.[864] In 1528 a new mayor of Sandwich\r\nwas elected after the new fashion, the whole commonalty nominating\r\nthree jurats, one of whom was then chosen by the appointed committee\r\nof thirty-seven.[865] That the freemen did not give up their rights\r\nwithout a fight we may judge from the fact that in 1535 they again\r\nelected their mayor after the ancient custom of the town; but it was a\r\nlosing battle, and as a matter of fact no popular liberties survived\r\nthis century. The common council was reduced to twenty-four members,\r\nand both the upper and lower councils alike were appointed by the mayor\r\nand jurats. The election of the mayor was taken from the people, and\r\nthe jurats succeeded in turn to the post by order of seniority.[866]\r\nFinally even the right of the commons to vote at assemblies was taken\r\nfrom them in 1595, to be restored in 1599, and again taken away “for\r\ntheir insolence and disorder” in 1603.\r\n\r\nIn Sandwich, therefore, it is obvious that the reform movement failed,\r\nnot through inherent vice or defect of its own, but by the overpowering\r\npressure of an external force—on this occasion by the federal council\r\nof the united states that made up the confederation of the Cinque\r\nPorts. No doubt the easy victory of the whole confederation was made\r\npossible by the decaying fortunes of the town; for at the time of its\r\ndefeat the vigour and the glory of Sandwich had departed. Works for\r\nthe preservation of the port had been constantly going on since the\r\nthirteenth century when the artificial canal known as the Delf was dug,\r\nand put under the charge of overseers; though after a brave struggle of\r\ntwo hundred years diggers and sluice-makers could no longer hold their\r\nown against winds and sands that silted up their harbour. In 1483 the\r\ntown, under the threat of breaking up the whole wall they had built,\r\nordered the gentlemen and yeomen of the country who had pastures by the\r\nstream to scour their dykes and make sluices; though neither the forced\r\nefforts of the county squires, nor the royal grant to the town in 1548\r\nof all the plate and treasures of the parish churches to carry on the\r\nworks of the harbour;[867] nor a later Act of Parliament for deepening\r\nthe Stour, could rescue Sandwich from its doom. In its decrepitude\r\nliberty slipped from its grasp. But the disaster of a later time must\r\nnot wholly obscure with its shadow the records of days when Sandwich\r\nwas rejoicing in brighter fortunes. If in the decay of its prosperity\r\nand hope the oligarchy fixed their yoke on the neck of the people, and\r\ninaugurated the rule of the plutocrats, their victory was not quickly\r\nwon; for throughout the fifteenth century, as we have seen, when by\r\nthe necessity of the times the question of stricter organization of\r\npublic life was here as elsewhere forced into prominence, the commons\r\nof Sandwich neither renounced their rights to self-government, nor\r\nfailed to take an adequate part in moulding the new constitution. It is\r\nindeed not impossible that the oligarchic congregation of the Brodhull\r\nmainly drew its force for the suppression of popular independence from\r\nthe support or even the instigation of the Court; for we can easily\r\nunderstand that at a time when under the policy of the Tudors England\r\nfigured as a great power in Europe, laden with obligations and with\r\nhatreds, her ministers were driven to look anxiously to her first line\r\nof defence against foreign foes. The policy of securing the main ports\r\nin the hands of a little group of loyal officials, easily controlled\r\nfrom headquarters, and no friends to common riots or rebellions, must\r\ninevitably have followed the revival of the ancient tradition which\r\nsaw in the safety of the realm the whole purpose of the Cinque Port\r\nconfederation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH the reign of Henry the Eighth a wholly new chapter opens in the\r\nhistory of the towns. In the preceding centuries we have traced their\r\ngradual rise out of obscure poverty into an illustrious opulence and\r\ndignity. Already in the time of Langland the poet’s imagination was\r\narrested by the exalted position of the mayor, the “days-man” who could\r\nlay his hand upon the highest and the lowest—on the royal majesty and\r\nthe mean people of the commune. When, a hundred and fifty years later,\r\nanother poet pictures the court of Fame, where she sits\r\n\r\n  “Under a glorious cloth of estate ...\r\n  Encrowned as empress of all this world of fate.”[868]\r\n\r\nhe sees in the crowd of applicants who press round the throne to\r\nsolicit her favours the men of Dartmouth and Portsmouth and Plymouth,\r\nthe burgesses and bailiffs of the Cinque Ports, mingling with\r\nmessengers from Thrace and Rounceval. Nor were their claims to stand\r\nin such a court but a fantastic fiction of poetry. We have seen how\r\nthe commune and the borough—originally in spite of their collective\r\ncharacter mere feudal lordships like the rest, introduced under the\r\nsanction and protection of ordinary feudal custom and according to the\r\nfictions of feudal law—became in course of time a potent force for the\r\nrending asunder of the mediæval framework of society. Patronized and\r\nencouraged by the king, nourished in great measure at the expense of\r\nthe baronage, lay and ecclesiastical, these insidious communities of\r\nthe people had gradually revealed a character of their own alien to the\r\nwhole feudal tradition. Under the shelter of their walls the forces of\r\nthe middle class were mustered for battle against the ancient supremacy\r\nof the nobility and the Church. Charters “for the accommodation of the\r\nburgesses in doing their business quietly” became the cover for their\r\nirresistible attack; and the common bell which rang out to assemble the\r\ncongregation of enfranchised burghers perpetually announced in every\r\nborough of the kingdom the ultimate triumph of “the common people of\r\nthe realm.”\r\n\r\nWe have also noted the manner in which during these centuries\r\nthe boroughs remained strongholds of a robust faith in political\r\nfreedom.[869] Theories of liberty taught by statesmen and philosophers,\r\nand debated by barons and knights in their own manner at Runnymede,\r\non the battle-field, or in the council chamber, assumed in the towns\r\nhomelier forms, and became the vulgar property of the people. The\r\nburgher too had his notion of an ideal freedom—a freedom which had\r\nnever entered within the range of his experience, but in which he\r\nstill believed with a transcendent faith. In what manner the faith\r\nhad come to him it is hard to say, through what legal fiction, from\r\nwhat mysterious tradition, by what dominant instinct of race. To\r\nquell the enemy and the accuser he might call to witness Domesday\r\nor Magna Charta, or liberties registered in the Old Red Book of\r\nthe town “as we do think,” or in the customs of the elders; or for\r\nlack of better authority, the fable of a lost charter of the Saxon\r\nHouse, or a shadowy local legend, or tale of freedom “long before the\r\nConquest,”[870] served as evidence of repute. But for the believer\r\ntestimony was superfluous; the very vagueness of his faith was not\r\nwithout advantages, since the fancied world of the past might be\r\nadequately furnished with types of all that was desired in the present.\r\nImagination was stimulated by the rivalry of factions, and political\r\ndiscussion never ceased. No doubt the vulgarization of the notion of\r\nfreedom, thus thrown into the market-place for burghers to cut and trim\r\nto their own needs, has had a permanent effect on English thought.[871]\r\nIn communities where strictly personal ambition in government was\r\nreduced to its lowest expression, where the only possible tyranny\r\nwas that of a class or of a group, and where the whole society of\r\nburghers was nourished on a tradition of equal and indestructible\r\nrights, the privilege coveted by ordinary folk was not the pleasure\r\nof exercizing authority, but the right to suffer no coercion. Among\r\nthe townsfolk the “gentleman” was not the man who ruled his neighbour,\r\nbut the enfranchised equal among his fellows. It may not be altogether\r\nfanciful to detect, in the noble translation of a church collect, not\r\nonly the fine intuition of the scholar, but an echo of the spirit of\r\nfree and equal liberty that was quickening among the people at large.\r\nIf the phrase “Cui servire est regnare” carried to English ears a\r\nforeign thought, the English words introduced a new and characteristic\r\nmeaning—“Whose service is perfect freedom.”\r\n\r\nLastly we have seen how chequered was the fate of liberty—how often\r\nit was obstructed and impaired in its passage through the market-place\r\nand the bye-lanes of the city, driven from shelter to shelter, banished\r\nfrom the Guildhall, mocked by a false homage. Between the twelfth\r\ncentury, when the trading communities had represented a new democracy\r\nand led the attack on the then established magnates of society; and\r\nthe sixteenth century, when a ruling oligarchy had been formed out of\r\ntheir ranks, a vast change had taken place in the political relations\r\nof the prosperous middle class. In their conduct of the great struggle\r\nfor emancipation from the county potentates, feudal or official, and in\r\ntheir development of a general freedom of trade, the more prosperous\r\nburghers who had first come to the front in affairs had proved the\r\nchampions of a new liberty. The strong government which they had\r\nestablished through the administration of a select body of experts\r\nhad abundantly justified itself in setting the independence of the\r\ntowns beyond attack; and long before the fifteenth century had opened\r\nthe boroughs, represented by their magistrates and councillors, held\r\nan impregnable position. Meanwhile, however, the wave of industrial\r\nprogress began slowly to lift up out of their dumb helplessness the\r\nmasses who had till now learned obedience of poverty and despair, for\r\n“While hunger was their master would none strive.” Imperceptibly the\r\nwhole scene was changed, and a new conflict was seen to be preparing.\r\nBy the slow changes of time what had been the democracy of 1200 had\r\nbecome the oligarchy of 1500. On the one hand the plutocrats of the\r\nboroughs had made their way into the circle of the privileged classes;\r\nin a thousand points their interests now coincided with those of the\r\nofficials and the gentry in the counties; and their conservative\r\ninstincts had won the confidence and sympathy of the court. On the\r\nother hand the humbler sort of traders and artizans, congregated more\r\nand more thickly at the busy centres of industry, made familiar with\r\nthe uses and methods of association, and impatient both of tyranny and\r\nof want, were beginning to form a new democracy, and to constitute to\r\nthe comfortable classes an alarming social danger. In every borough\r\nthe problems which confront the modern world were formulated. On all\r\nside agitators proclaimed the right of the workers to have a voice in\r\nthe organization of trade, and the right of the common burghers to\r\nshare in the control of municipal affairs. The demand of the people\r\nthat government should really be carried on by their consent, so\r\neasily stifled in the thirteenth century, became in the fifteenth loud\r\nand persistent; and riotous confederacies of labourers and artizans\r\nadded excitement to the political demonstrations in the streets. A\r\nnew terror invaded the council-chamber of the Guildhall—the terror\r\nof the mob. While the craft-masters hastened to fortify the guild\r\nagainst the forces of misrule, town councillors made strong the borough\r\nadministration in the interests of good order. The history of the\r\nmunicipalities in the fifteenth century is far from indicating an\r\nera of political apathy, or of mere civic indolence and corruption.\r\nIn the records of the trade fraternities we see the opening of an\r\nindustrial war. In the constitutions and ordinances of the towns we\r\nsee the foreshadowing of a political revolution. The original struggle\r\nwith feudal forces had closed in triumph for the boroughs, and a new\r\nconflict now takes its beginning. Faction fights, crafty intrigues,\r\nintricate constitutional changes, these signalise the opening of a new\r\ncontroversy—the controversy between the middle and the lower classes.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment however when this division of social forces had\r\ndeclared itself, and when it seemed as though the attention of England\r\nwas to be concentrated on the new social problem, the whole movement\r\nwas suddenly arrested. All speculation as to what might have happened\r\nin the course of a natural evolution is utterly vain. It is probable\r\nindeed that the poorer classes, unfed, untaught, and undisciplined,\r\nwere at that time wholly unprepared to enter on any struggle for\r\nindustrial and political emancipation, and if the battle had been\r\nreally fought out, must have suffered a crushing defeat. Centuries\r\nof discipline have been needed to consolidate their forces, and\r\nvery possibly the course of freedom was best served by delay. As a\r\nmatter of fact however the social question was cast aside by external\r\nand arbitrary forces. It was engulfed in the political revolution\r\ninaugurated by the early Tudors. So violent was the change that it is\r\nonly in our own age that the controversies which were opening in the\r\nfifteenth century have again taken the foremost place.\r\n\r\nFor from the moment when the history of national politics begins under\r\nthe Tudor kings, the whole character and significance of the local\r\ncentres of government undergo a profound change. Henry the Seventh,\r\nas we have seen, had laid the foundation of a vast commercial policy;\r\nbut until the reign of Henry the Eighth, England, unconscious of\r\nits capacity and of its destiny, stood aloof from European affairs;\r\nand with her small population, her inadequate navy, her somewhat\r\nold-fashioned army, her feeble political influence, was little more\r\nthan an upstart in the august society of continental nations. From this\r\nposition she was raised by the genius of Wolsey into a State of which\r\nit might be said that its Crown “is this day more esteemed than the\r\nEmperor’s Crown and all his Empire;” and of whose minister a Venetian\r\nambassador reports that “he is seven times more powerful than the\r\nPope.”[872] In a very few years England, courted by French and Spanish\r\nkings, and able to treat on equal terms with Pope and Emperor, boasted\r\nof being mediator and arbiter of European politics. The pride of a\r\ngreat mission exalted the imagination of her people, and a poet of the\r\nRenascence in his vision of “all manner of nations” who dwelt on the\r\nfield of fame, marked the gate of chalcedony which gave entrance to\r\n“Anglia.”\r\n\r\n  “The building thereof was passing commendable;\r\n  Whereon stood a leopard, crowned with gold and stones,\r\n  Terrible of countenance and passing formidable, ...\r\n  As fiercely frowning as he had been fighting.”[873]\r\n\r\nBy the royal courage and appetite of Henry the Eighth, bent on making\r\nthe whole people his accomplices for the carrying out of his personal\r\nwill, the work of Wolsey was continued, though in a very different\r\ntemper, and the national pride and confidence pushed to the highest\r\npoint. If the policy of Cromwell had been fully carried out, the\r\nhistory of the Reformation and the fortunes of Europe might have been\r\nreversed by the intervention of England. We can well understand that\r\namid these tremendous schemes local aspirations were forgotten and\r\nlocal quarrellings silenced. To perfect the policy of the new Monarchy\r\nthe destinies of the several towns were submerged in the destinies of\r\nthe whole Commonwealth. Sovereigns no longer viewed with interested\r\nregard or with indifferent tolerance, as of old,[874] the growth of\r\nborough franchises and the developement of local governments. Street\r\nriots were no longer matters of the parish, but of the State. The\r\nking’s hand was stretched out over the wealthy corporations whose\r\nliberties had grown into such vast proportions, and like the baronage\r\nand the Church, the boroughs were laid prostrate before the throne.\r\n\r\nFor under the Tudor system of government the king was the necessary\r\ncentre of every interest in the country.[875] He alone could impose\r\na common policy and give expression to a national will. To him all\r\nclasses looked to defend their cause and ensure their prosperity, in\r\nthe implicit faith that he lived for them alone and to perform their\r\nwill. In the royal power lay the one force by which England could\r\nbe held together. At an earlier time, indeed, the common folk had\r\nrepudiated the doctrine of the king’s absolute supremacy as it was now\r\nunderstood. “They say that the king should live upon his commons, and\r\nthat their bodies and goods are his: the contrary is true, for then\r\nneeded him never to set Parliament and to ask good of them.”[876] But\r\nnow new maxims were scattered abroad—“that the king can do no wrong,\r\nhowever much he may wish to do it; that not only the property but\r\nthe persons of his subjects are his own; and that a man has a right\r\nto no more than the king’s goodness thinks fit not to take from him.”\r\nParliament almost ceased to exist, until in course of time, packed with\r\nmembers carefully nominated, and by the craft of the king elaborately\r\nduped, it was turned into a mere instrument by which the most ruthless\r\nacts of royal aggression could be given the stamp and semblance of\r\nlaw.[877]\r\n\r\nThe new centralized government was carried on by means of a vast\r\nofficial system which extended from the highest to the lowest\r\ndepartments, and reached out to the farthest limits of the country. In\r\nits efficient form it was practically the creation of the first Tudor\r\nking. With Warwick the baronial leaders of an earlier time had passed\r\naway; and the weakened remnant of the baronage which emerged from the\r\ncivil wars had been carefully depressed by Henry the Seventh. At the\r\ncouncil-board their places were taken by officials who received their\r\norders directly from the king; and when the barons returned to office\r\nand council they returned as fellow servants with the new officials,\r\nand holding the same functions. Henry the Eighth carried out the same\r\npolicy. The great nobles might complain of “low-born knaves” who\r\nsurrounded the king; but when the minister “clapped his rod upon the\r\nboard” silence fell on an obsequious council—and barons and commons\r\nalike trembled before the son of an Ipswich merchant or a Putney\r\nblacksmith.\r\n\r\nFor the tremendous power of Wolsey or of Cromwell lay in the fact that\r\nthe whole hierarchy of officials, from the most exalted to the most\r\nbase, was directly responsible to him. Every figure of any importance\r\nin the country was perfectly well known to the minister at the head of\r\naffairs, and on every subordinate through the length and breadth of\r\nthe land the court kept vigilant watch. If an official at any point\r\ndisagreed with the opinions held at head quarters he was forthwith\r\nturned out of office, and the ease with which Henry and his successors\r\nmade national revolutions is the measure of the absolute perfection to\r\nwhich the machinery of their administration had been brought. In the\r\nboroughs it is impossible to exaggerate the effect of this political\r\nrevolution. The consequence to which the towns had risen made of\r\nthem all-important centres of administration for the maintenance of\r\ngeneral order. Two-thirds of the members of Parliament were sent from\r\nthe boroughs, and the control of these members, therefore, meant the\r\ncontrol of the House of Commons. For a two-fold reason, therefore,\r\nthe tendency long shewn by the Court to sympathize with the governing\r\noligarchy in the municipalities inevitably took from this time a\r\nnew force. Under the oligarchic system of administration the towns\r\ncould be held for the king by a mere handful of loyal officials; and\r\nthe influence of the Crown was naturally flung on the side of the\r\nrepresentatives of good order, as it was understood by the government.\r\nIn the interests of the whole State a new policy was developed.\r\nMunicipal independence was struck down at the very roots, and the free\r\ngrowth of earlier days arrested by an iron discipline invented at\r\nWestminster, and enforced by a selected company of Townhall officials,\r\nwhose authority was felt to be ultimately supported by the majesty of\r\nthe king himself. The number of the town councillors was constantly\r\ndiminished, and the liberties of the commons curtailed. Under the new\r\nconditions the individual life of the borough ceased to have the same\r\nsignificance as of old, and an era opened in which its highest destiny\r\nwas to be employed as an instrument of the royal will for national\r\nends, and its only glory lay in forming one of the members of a mighty\r\ncommonwealth. To follow out the internal record of municipal politics\r\non the old lines, as though the story of the sixteenth century were\r\nthe natural consequence of their earlier course of developement would\r\nbe radically false; and I therefore pause on the threshold of the new\r\nstate of things. The history of the boroughs as schools in which the\r\nnew middle class received its training for service in the field of\r\nnational politics, and as the laboratories in which they made their\r\nmost fruitful experiments in administration, ends before the close of\r\nthe fifteenth century. It may be that as the working class in its turn\r\nrises to take its place alongside of its predecessors on the stage of\r\npublic affairs, the towns will again become centres of interest in the\r\nnational story, as the workshops of an enlarged political science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Abingdon, money given towards bridges at, 75-6;\r\n    Guild of Holy Cross, 215;\r\n    supplies Southampton with bends of elms for ploughs, 289\r\n\r\n  Accounts of towns, adornment of, 260;\r\n    change in manner of keeping and auditing in Lynn, 411;\r\n    of Norwich, 370, _note_ 4;\r\n    royal, auditing and signing of, 15, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Admiral of the Fleet, 323\r\n\r\n  Admiralty, courts of, 319, _note_ 2\r\n\r\n  Adventurers, merchant, Guild of, 112;\r\n    results of their monopoly of cloth trade, 91-92\r\n\r\n  Agriculture, law for protection of, 99\r\n\r\n  “Alablaster man” of Nottingham, 54, 326\r\n\r\n  Alberti, Society of, 290\r\n\r\n  Alcock, Bishop of Rochester, 14\r\n\r\n  Aldermen in Canterbury, 156, 276, 279, _note_;\r\n    Gloucester, 287;\r\n    Lincoln, 279, _note_;\r\n    London, 279, 375, _note_ 2;\r\n    Lynn, 421, 422;\r\n    Norwich, 362, _note_ 2, 380;\r\n    Nottingham, 309, 339, 340;\r\n    Oxford, 245, _note_ 2, 278, _note_ 2;\r\n    Shrewsbury, 286;\r\n    Southampton, 307-309, 312, _note_\r\n\r\n  Andernach, mill-stones brought from, 406, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Andover, dispute between great people and community in, 245, _note_ 4;\r\n    common lands, 237;\r\n    leet jury, 229;\r\n    merchant guild, 193, _note_ 1, 198, _note_ 1, 199\r\n\r\n  Anne of Bohemia, Nottingham given to, 330\r\n\r\n  Appleby, its school, 14, _note_ 2\r\n\r\n  Apprentices, their duty during harvest, 64;\r\n    escape from town and become free traders in suburbs, 96-97;\r\n    regulations concerning, 99, _note_ 2, 102-104, 108, 120, 212,\r\n        _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Artizans, guilds of, 112;\r\n    subjected to town authorities, 151-152;\r\n    question as to their admission to guild merchant, 192-193, 199\r\n\r\n  Ashburton, its school, 13, _note_ 2\r\n\r\n  Ascham, his rebuke of noblemen’s sons, 23\r\n\r\n  Assembly, the common, 226, 247-249;\r\n    of Hereford, 225;\r\n    of Sandwich, 225-227, 430;\r\n    select committee of, 353;\r\n    of Norwich, 365, 371-372, 377-379;\r\n    its Rolls, 370;\r\n    of Nottingham, 341, 347-348, 352-353\r\n\r\n  Assize of beer, 35;\r\n    of bread, 35;\r\n    of wine, 35;\r\n    of breadth of cloth, 67, _note_ 2\r\n\r\n  Atwill, John, mayor of Exeter, 180\r\n\r\n  Atwood, Thomas, town clerk of Canterbury, 263, _note_ 2\r\n\r\n  Atwood, William, one of counsel of Canterbury, 263, _note_ 2\r\n\r\n  Aylesbury, charge against miller of, 31-32\r\n\r\n\r\n  B\r\n\r\n  Babington, Sir John, 329, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Bablake, church at, 203, _note_ 3;\r\n    payment of its warden and priests, 206\r\n\r\n  Bablake Gate, Coventry, 207\r\n\r\n  Bachelors, fellowship of the, among Exeter tailors, 172\r\n\r\n  “Bachery, Le”, Guild of, in Norwich, 389, 392\r\n\r\n  Bailiffs, modes of election of, 275, _note_ 3, 276;\r\n    of Canterbury, 227, _note_ 2, 276, 283-284;\r\n    of Ipswich, 223-224;\r\n    of Lincoln, 250;\r\n    of leets in Norwich, 361-364, 373;\r\n    of Shrewsbury, 285;\r\n    of Southampton, 305, 309;\r\n    of Winchester, 286;\r\n    of Yarmouth, 434\r\n\r\n  Bakers of Canterbury, 46;\r\n    of Exeter, their ordinances, 179;\r\n    of London, withdraw outside boundaries, 45;\r\n    punishment of fraudulent servants among, 117, _note_ 2;\r\n    their right of search transferred to mayor, 149, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Ball, John, 211\r\n\r\n  Baltic, trade with Southampton, 289\r\n\r\n  Banbury, its school, 17\r\n\r\n  Bardi, Society of, rent part of tenement in Southampton, 290\r\n\r\n  Bargate Tower, Southampton, 310\r\n\r\n  Barge, the town, of Lynn, 410\r\n\r\n  Barnstaple, use of seal of commonalty in, 233, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Bartholomew of Baddlesmere, custos of Bristol, 267\r\n\r\n  Bartone, Brother William, his connexion with strike of shoemakers’\r\n      journeymen in London, 125\r\n\r\n  Bate, Andrew, 60\r\n\r\n  Bate (brother of Andrew), town clerk of Lydd, 60\r\n\r\n  Bath, merchants become Knights of the, 79\r\n\r\n  Bayonne, swearing-in of citizens at, 230, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Beam, right of keeping, 27\r\n\r\n  Beaufort, Cardinal, 292\r\n\r\n  Beer, sent from Kent to Flanders, 89\r\n\r\n  Bell, the common, 226;\r\n    made for Ely Cathedral, 54;\r\n    metal for, got from Lincolnshire, 54, _note_ 1\r\n\r\n  Bell foundry at Nottingham, 326\r\n\r\n  Bellman of Guild of S.

Nicholas kept “time out of mind a free school\r\nwithin the said city in a great hall belonging to the said Guild called\r\nthe Trinity Hall.” The Guild of Palmers supported a school at Ludlow;\r\nand so did Guilds at Stratford and at Deritend. The Guild of Kalenders\r\nin Bristol had in the twelfth century kept a school of Jews, and when\r\nthat business came to an end were still charged with education, public\r\nlectures, and the management of a free library. (English Guilds, 51,\r\n205, 196, 221, 288. See Hunt’s Bristol, 112, 249, 260.) The Drapers had\r\na school at Shrewsbury (Hibbert’s Inf. of English Guilds, 33); and the\r\nMerchant Tailors in London (Clode, 35). I learn from Mr. A. F. Leach\r\nthat at Ashburton the Grammar School founded 1314 by Bishop Stapledon\r\nof Exeter (who also founded Exeter College) was entrusted to the Guild\r\nof St. Lawrence, whose chantry-priest was the schoolmaster. The school\r\nis still kept on the site of the Guild Chapel, the original tower of\r\nwhich forms part of the School.\r\n\r\n[25] Hunter’s Deanery of Doncaster, vol ii. 5-6.\r\n\r\n[26] Bentham’s History of Ely Cathedral, 2nd Edition, 182. Hull Grammar\r\nSchool Gazette, 1891, No. 8, p. 88. See Riley’s Liber Albus, xix.\r\nThere was a grammar master at Ewelme Almshouse 1461 (ibid. 627), where\r\nteaching was to be free (ibid. ix. 217-8). Four new grammar schools\r\nwere opened in London in 1447, and during the reign of Henry the Sixth\r\nnine were set up in London alone (Pauli’s Pictures, 452). In 1472 Prior\r\nSelling, of Christchurch, reports to the Archbishop of Canterbury that\r\nhe has provided a “schoolmaster for your grammar schools in Canterbury,\r\nthe which hath lately taught grammar at Winchester and at S. Antony’s\r\nin London” (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 105). John Syre, the grammar school\r\nmaster in 1436, lived in Gayhow’s tenement, S. Alphege parish (ibid.\r\n139). The Almshouse of the poor sisters in Reading was in 1486 turned\r\ninto a grammar school (Coates’ Reading, 15); there was a school in\r\nAppleby taught by a chantry priest before the middle of the fifteenth\r\ncentury (Transactions of Cumberland and Westmoreland Arch. Soc. part\r\nii. vol. viii.); and one in Preston whose master was made a burgess\r\nin 1415 (Memorials of Preston Guilds, 14). In Liverpool there was an\r\nendowed free school before the reformation (Picton’s Memorials, ii.\r\n55-6). Miss Dormer Harris has learned from the town records that the\r\nexpenses of the grammar school at Coventry in the fifteenth century,\r\nwere paid by the Trinity Guild—in other words, by the Corporation.\r\nIt is evident that when William Bingham, who founded a grammar school\r\nattached to Clare Hall, Cambridge, says that in 1439 he passed seventy\r\ndeserted schools in travelling from Hampton to Ripon by way of\r\nCoventry (Boase’s Oxford, 108), we cannot infer from this any decay\r\nin education. It may have indicated a shifting of population, or more\r\nprobably perhaps the results of the effort made in 1391 to prevent\r\nvilleins from being put to the clerical schools in preparation for\r\ntaking minor orders and so gaining emancipation from their lords.

I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. A. F.\r\nLeach for this reference—as well as for that about Stockport, and\r\nthe reference to the School Gazette and the Town Records of Hull. He\r\ninforms me that the first school founded by a lay person of which we\r\nhave as yet any record was at Wotton-under-Edge, and was founded by a\r\nwoman, Lady Berkeley, in 1385.\r\n\r\n[30] Baines’ Hist. of the County of Lancaster, i. 296-7.\r\n\r\n[31] The author of Piers Ploughman criticizes the education given by\r\nthe clerics of his day. “Grammar that ground is of all” was neglected\r\nso that no one could now either “versify fair” or construe what the\r\npoets wrote.\r\n\r\n“Doctors of degree and of divinity masters That should the seven arts\r\nconne and assoil _ad quodlibet_, But they fail in philosophy, an\r\nphilosophers lived And would well examine them, wonder me thinketh!”\r\n\r\n—Passus xviii. 107-118.\r\n\r\n\r\n[32] The “alphabet and the humanities” did not imply culture in\r\nanything like our sense of the word, nor yet Latin from the literary\r\npoint of view, but the old ecclesiastical discipline, which included\r\nabove all things _logic_, and which ultimately led, if the pupil\r\nadvanced far enough, to the scholastic philosophy. Thus for example in\r\nthe _Epistolæ obscurorum virorum_ one of the (priestly) correspondents\r\nis made to protest against the introduction of the study of Vergil and\r\nother new-fangled writers.\r\n\r\n[33] Hist.

(Picton’s Memorials, i. 38.) Leland writing in 1533 says: “Irish\r\nmerchants come much thither as to a good haven,” and in the margin he\r\nadds, “at Liverpool is a small custom paid that causeth merchants to\r\nresort.” The trade of later days had even then begun: “Good merchants\r\nat Liverpool, much Irish yarn that Manchester men do buy there.” (Ibid.\r\ni. 46.)\r\n\r\n[95] Fosbrooke’s Gloucestershire, i. 204-8.

I suspect that the question of these fulling-mills\r\nin London was much complicated by the supply of water becoming\r\ninadequate to the needs of the growing city, and the great resentment\r\nfelt by the fullers of cloth against the intrusion of the cap-makers on\r\ntheir domain over the running streams. There is some evidence that this\r\nwas the case, and it is probable that the want of water-power was one\r\nof the causes which drove the woollen manufacture from certain towns.\r\n\r\n[197] 22 Edward IV. cap. 5.

About 1528 the London shoemakers\r\ncomplain that whereas the King had granted leave that a fraternity of\r\nforty-four foreigners might exercise the craft of shoemakers in the\r\ncity, by colour of this grant 220 foreign householders employing over\r\n400 apprentices and servants, had set up in the business. An amusing\r\naccount is given of the attitude of this foreign company to the English\r\nsearchers of the craft. There had once been 140 Englishmen of the\r\ncordwainers’ livery but now there were only twenty, and the wives and\r\nchildren of those who had been ruined were turned into water-carriers\r\nand labourers. These foreigners did not come to settle, but having made\r\ntheir fortunes went off home, while others took their places. (Schanz,\r\nii. 598-600.)\r\n\r\n[205] Schanz, ii. 596-8.

II. cap. 5).\r\n\r\n[213] It is important in the town ordinances to observe the effect of\r\nlocal circumstances. For instance, in Coventry the weavers were allowed\r\nin 1424 to take as many apprentices as they liked, “sine contradictione\r\nalicujus,” while the number in other trades was limited. This was just\r\nsuch an order as might be expected of a town council of rich merchant\r\nclothiers and drapers.\r\n\r\n[214] See Chap. V.\r\n\r\n[215] The customs of Norwich, 1340, forced some responsibility for\r\nthese servants on the masters. (Leet Jurisdiction (Selden Soc.), lxvi.)\r\n\r\n[216] No general laws for the whole kingdom which seriously limited the\r\nemployment of apprentices were passed before the sixteenth century,\r\nbut the various towns made such local laws as seemed necessary. In\r\nmost cases masters were bound to enrol their apprentices in the town\r\ncourt; and at the end of the fifteenth century the Town Councils and\r\nthe Guilds were making serious efforts to enforce the law. Miss Dormer\r\nHarris tells me that the capper’s apprentices in Coventry were bound\r\nby surety for £5 to fulfil their covenant. If an apprentice left his\r\nmaster before the seven years were over, the master might not take\r\nanother till the time had expired unless he delivered the £5 to the\r\nkeepers for the use of the craft. The masters of crafts there appear to\r\nhave been very reluctant to take apprentices, especially after 1494.\r\n\r\n[217] In Norwich in spite of the statutes of 1436 and 1503 (15 Henry\r\nVI. cap. 6; 19 Henry VII. cap. 7) the crafts persisted in making rules\r\nby which apprentices were compelled to pay 20_s._ or 30_s._ for entry\r\ninto the common hall (compare the composition of 1415 in the Norwich\r\ndocuments)—a fine which meant that the craftsmen were practically\r\ndenied the freedom of the city, and therefore the position of master,\r\nand were thus forced to swell the body of journeymen. An Act passed\r\nin 1531 ordered that no apprentice should pay more than 2_s._ 6_d._\r\nfor entry into the common hall; or 3_s._ 4_d._ at the end of the term\r\nfor the freedom of the company; but the companies evaded this law by\r\nasking only the statute sum for the freedom of the company, but making\r\nthe candidates swear they would not trade without license, for which\r\nthey had to pay at the company’s pleasure. This was again forbidden by\r\nHenry in 1537 (Blomefield, iii. 181-2). Among the weavers of Newcastle\r\nin 1527 all who had finished their apprenticeship were admitted to\r\nmembership on payment of 13_s._ 4_d._, but any man of the craft\r\ndesirous to be of the fellowship a brother thereof, with power to set\r\nup shop, had to pay £20 (Newcastle Guilds). The London grocers in 1345\r\npaid 20_s._ for each apprentice; the apprentice who wished to belong to\r\nthe fraternity paid 40_s._ on leaving his master (Kingdon’s Grocers’\r\nCompany, i. 11, 12).\r\n\r\n[218] Compare Riley’s Mem. Lond. 244, 181, 278, 354. Black’s\r\nLeathersellers, 39.\r\n\r\n[219] In London no apprentice after his term was to use his trade till\r\nhe had been sworn to the franchise. (Liber Albus, 272.)\r\n\r\n[220] Journeymen among the cutlers and founders who had not served\r\ntheir time as apprentices could only get such wages as the overseers\r\nof the trade allowed to them after examination. (Riley’s Mem. Lond.\r\n439, 514.) The system was probably widespread to judge from the many\r\nordinances concerning wages. Unskilled journeymen must be spoken\r\nof in the ordinances of the bladesmiths. (Riley’s Mem. 570.) For\r\nserving-men who worked by the day for the glovers see ibid. 246. In\r\n1449 at Coventry a reasonable wage seems to have been 4_d._ a day; but\r\na capper’s journeyman in 1496 got 12_d._ a week working twelve hours a\r\nday (reference to Coventry records given me by Miss Dormer Harris).\r\n\r\n[221] 7 Henry IV. cap. 17.\r\n\r\n[222] The law was done away with when it turned to the hurt of the\r\nemployers. In a later state of the cloth industry some of the old\r\ncentres of industry such as London and Norwich and Bristol found their\r\nwealth decayed; and decided that their trade was starved for want\r\nof workmen while the young people were growing up to idleness and\r\nvice. Then the masters, actually threatened with the loss of their\r\nmanufacturing industries, insisted on new laws allowing them to take\r\napprentices without regard to the Act of Henry the Fourth (11 Henry\r\nVII. cap. 11; 12 Henry VII. cap. 1).\r\n\r\n[223] Hudson’s Notes about Norwich; in Norfolk and Norwich Arch.

Possibly the system may\r\neven then have been like the ordinary system which generally prevailed\r\ntill the end of the last century. In Dereham in Norfolk the site of a\r\nline of hovels is still marked in which a group of shoemakers lived and\r\nworked for the Norwich masters, whose collector came round every week\r\nto collect the finished work. A rich farmer seems to have served as a\r\nsort of contractor in the tailoring trade; the upper floor of his house\r\nimmediately below the roof formed a long room without any partitions in\r\nwhich ten or twelve tailors worked by day and slept by night, and the\r\ncontractor dispatched their work to the Norwich dealer.\r\n\r\n[225] Chap. XII. p. 385. See also the monopoly of the York weavers in\r\nthe twelfth century, with the control of trade in the whole county\r\nwhich it must have implied. (Gross, i. 108, note.)\r\n\r\n[226] English Guilds, 383.\r\n\r\n[227] Von Ochenkowski (Wirthschaftliche Entwickelung, 128-133)\r\nscarcely seems to distinguish sufficiently between the objections to\r\nthe competition of the dealers or masters from the suburbs, and to\r\nthe employment by town manufacturers of labour outside the town. The\r\nresistance would necessarily have come from different quarters and for\r\ndifferent reasons.\r\n\r\n[228] Cf. The Common Weal (ed. E. Lamond), 49.\r\n\r\n[229] The well-known rioter is described by Skelton. Poems (ed. Dyce),\r\nii. 43-4.\r\n\r\n[230] This was sometimes done by royal charter. (Hibbert’s Influence\r\nof Eng. Guilds, 96.) All the facts are against the theory of Marx that\r\nthe merchant was by some hostile force prevented from buying labour,\r\nthough allowed to buy other commodities. The limitations were of the\r\nmerchants’ and dealers’ own making for their own purposes. It is\r\nequally improbable that the guild organization excluded division of\r\nlabour in the workshop. (Marx, Capital, &c. i. 352.)\r\n\r\n[231] This uniformity is well illustrated in the later ordinances of\r\nthe Hull Guilds. (Lambert, Two Thousand Years of Guild Life; Gross, ii.\r\n272.)\r\n\r\n[232] Clode, Merchant Tailors, p. 2.\r\n\r\n[233] In 1311 the “hatters” and the “dealers who bought and sold hats”\r\nin London were two quite distinct callings. (Riley’s Mem. 90.) The\r\ndistinction was well known in 1327 between the saddlers and the various\r\norders of workmen employed in manufacturing for them. (Ibid. 157-8.)\r\n\r\n[234] A separation of the guilds into these groups is sufficient of\r\nitself to shew of how little value the generalizations of Marx are as\r\nto the relations of the crafts to capital; and how misleading it is to\r\nrepresent the guilds as providing the main opposition to merchants or\r\ncapitalists, especially in the matter of refusing the supply of labour.\r\n(See Marx i. 352.)\r\n\r\n[235] Seligman (Two Chapters on Mediæval Guilds, 69) states that\r\nthe crafts were not charitable associations giving relief to poor\r\nmembers till the fifteenth century. Out of twelve crafts mentioned in\r\nEnglish Guilds, nine gave relief to poor, and three do not mention\r\nit. For the Braelers in London, 1355, see Riley’s Mem. 277; the White\r\ntawyers, 1346, ibid. 232; the Lorimers, 1261, Liber Cust. 78-80.\r\nMost of the ordinances in Riley’s Mem. make no mention of relief,\r\nbut the ordinances are so manifestly incomplete—merely additions or\r\nalterations made for some special purpose—that no argument can be\r\ndrawn from them. The vast majority of religious or social guilds had\r\nsome charitable provisions, and in many cases these were certainly\r\ntrade guilds. The probability seems to lie on the side of help given to\r\npoor members from the first.\r\n\r\n[236] The way in which the guilds fought in defence of their voluntary\r\ncourts of arbitration, and the objection of the towns to these, is in\r\nitself proof enough of the importance to their members of a tribunal,\r\nhowever voluntary and arbitrary, which might relieve them from the\r\ninterference on every occasion of the local magistrates, and the\r\nparty politics of the town. The advantages of association in case of\r\nbeing called before the greater courts is evident from the account of\r\nmediæval procedure given in Sir J. Stephen’s History of the Criminal\r\nLaw. The illustrations afforded by the Paston Letters are without\r\nnumber. See Manorial Pleas (Selden Soc.), 136. For the heavy cost\r\ninvolved by the corrupt practices of lawyers, judges, pleaders, and\r\nattorneys, see the action brought in 1275 by an advocate against an\r\nemployer who had withdrawn from the case; the advocate sues for his\r\nfees and also for having been prevented by the stopping of the case\r\nfrom getting a very large sum of money out of the other side. (Ibid.\r\n155-6.)\r\n\r\n[237] It was a disgrace to the lord if any of his “livery” appeared in\r\nthe law courts. The protection extended to the members of a craft was\r\nreally efficient. See the punishment of a grocer who in 1404 had turned\r\nanother of the company out of his house. (Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company,\r\ni. 93.)\r\n\r\n[238] The grocers in London claimed control over every one who kept\r\na shop of spicery even if he did not wear their livery (Kingdon’s\r\nGrocers’ Company, i. 66); but those who refused the livery were fined.\r\nThe liveried members paid 2_s._ 6_d._ for the dinner, and “every man\r\nout of the clothing as us seemed they might bear.” (Ibid. ii. 239,\r\n258.) A list was kept of those who wore the livery, those who wore\r\ngowns, and householders and bachelors not in livery. (Ibid. 175-177.)\r\n\r\n[239] These divisions must be taken in a general sense. Five orders are\r\nmentioned among the Merchant Taylors (Clode, 8-9); but these really\r\nfall into three main groups. For our present purpose the “Bachelors,”\r\nan intermediate rank formed in some of the richer crafts, may be\r\nomitted.\r\n\r\n[240] See Du Cange.\r\n\r\n[241] Riley’s Mem. Lond. 258. See the case of the London bakers where a\r\nspecial ordinance was needed to make the servants liable to punishment\r\nfor the grossest frauds in the absence of the masters. (Ibid. 181-2.)\r\n\r\n[242] If a craftsman not admitted to the freedom of the guild took\r\nwork, the customer in case of fraud had only the protection of the\r\ncommon law, and could not appeal to the town or guild ordinances.\r\n(English Guilds, 322.)\r\n\r\n[243] From time to time there were protests on the part of the members\r\nof the craft against the power of the oligarchy. There was such a case\r\nin the London Grocers’ Company, when an attempt was made in 1444 to\r\nlimit the power of the wardens in appointing new members. (Kingdon’s\r\nGrocers’ Company, i. 123.)\r\n\r\n[244] English Guilds, 30, 35, 289. Twelve of the discreetest of the\r\nsmiths at Coventry elected the keepers, and formed the court to try\r\noffenders.\r\n\r\n[245] Lambert’s Guild Life, 113, 129; English Guilds, 156, 159, 162,\r\n217, 160, 169, 31, 164, 167, 318, 445. The weavers’ guild was governed\r\nby a council of twenty-four as early as the thirteenth century. (Lib.\r\nCus. 424.) In religious or social guilds there were cases where the\r\nelection of officers was made by the assent of all the brethren\r\n(English Guilds, 47, 49, 148, 213, 232), or “with the assent of the\r\n_elder part_ of the brethren and sistern of the guild” (ibid. 150); but\r\nthe prevailing custom was the appointment of picked men to choose the\r\nofficers. (English Guilds, 62, 64, 71, 75, 83, 89, 91, 97, 119, 266.)\r\nIn one case “all the brethren whom the alderman should send for” were\r\nto elect officers. (Ibid. 35.) In another the alderman chose two men,\r\nthe company chose two others, these four chose two more, and the six\r\nelected officers. In a later form copied for another craft instead of\r\nthe “company” the “masters of the guild” chose two men. (Ibid. 276.)\r\nIn one case a new provost was chosen by the four provosts of the past\r\nyear. (Ibid. 186.) In the Grocers’ Company the wardens appointed their\r\nsuccessors. (Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i. 10, 14, 18.) A similar\r\ncustom prevailed in the Southampton Guild Merchant.\r\n\r\n[246] Riley’s Mem. 348. In the Cordwainers’ Guild of Exeter (1481)\r\ntwo of the wardens were chosen from the shop-holders, and two from\r\nthe journeymen. (English Guilds, 332.) It would seem that among the\r\ncoruesers of Bristol the journeymen had a certain recognized position,\r\nthe visible sign of which was their having the right to provide lights\r\ncarried in the municipal processions at certain feasts; and when in\r\n1454 “divers debates and murmurs had arisen between the masters and\r\ncrafts of the coruesers and the journeymen,” and the masters and\r\ncraft-holders sought to deprive the journeymen of this right, the\r\nattempt was vigorously and successfully resisted.\r\n\r\n[247] In Ipswich when a youth in 1448 was apprenticed to a barber for\r\nseven years it was stipulated that he should get suitable clothing,\r\nshoes, bedding, board, and chastisement. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 259.)\r\nAt Romney in 1451 it was decreed that at the end of his service the\r\napprentice should receive from his master 10_s._ or a bed of that\r\nvalue. (Ibid. v. 543). A decree against using daggers or knives or\r\nmaking any affray was limited by the phrase, “provided always that it\r\nshall be lawful to any inhabitant to correct his servant or apprentice\r\naccording to the law.” (English Guilds, 390.) But on the other hand\r\nwhen a master among the tailors at Exeter chastised his servant so far\r\nas to bruise his arm and break his head, he had not only to give a fine\r\nto the craft but to give the servant 15_s._ and a month’s board and to\r\npay his doctor. (Ibid. 322.)\r\n\r\n[248] A master retiring from trade might sell and devise the services\r\nof his apprentice to a new master, but if there was any suspicion that\r\na sale had been so managed that the apprentice lost credit for one\r\nor two years of the service which he had actually fulfilled both the\r\nmasters were deprived of the freedom of the city and craft.

In Newcastle the guild of fullers and dyers in\r\ntheir ordinances of 1477 regulated the price of fulling and shearing\r\nthe various kinds of cloth by piece-work at so much a yard. The weavers\r\nalso worked by the piece. The Newcastle slaters had been formed into\r\na guild and had ordinances in 1451 with similar regulations; the\r\nbricklayers and plasterers were in a guild in 1454 (Newcastle Guilds).\r\nThere was piece-work among the tawyers. (Riley’s Mem. Lond. 330-1.) In\r\nWinchester the weavers probably worked at from 3_d._ to 4_d._ a day, as\r\nthey were ordered to take from Hallow Eve to the Annunciation for their\r\nwork but 1_s._ 6_d._, and from the Annunciation to Hallow Eve but 2_s._\r\n\r\n[254] In 1265 Leicester weavers were allowed by the guild to weave by\r\nnight as well as by day. (Gross, ii. 144.)\r\n\r\n[255] Riley’s Mem. Lond. 232-3. This was true of a great number of\r\ntrades. (Ibid. 244, 245-7, 258, &c. For Lincoln tailors, English\r\nGuilds, 183.

In Coventry the White Friars was the\r\nmeeting place for the fellowship of the crafts and for the tilers’\r\ncompany in the fifteenth century; and Friar John Bredon played\r\nthe part of a local agitator. The policy of the Friars was often,\r\nas in Canterbury, part of a general antagonism to other religious\r\nestablishments. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 98.)\r\n\r\n[261] Mem. Lond. 543-4. The suppression of the May-day festival of the\r\njourneymen shearmen in Shrewsbury was very possibly a similar putting\r\ndown of confederations and conspiracies. (Hibbert’s Inf. and Dev. of\r\nEng.

A\r\nlater instance occurs when the London Corporation brought a complaint\r\nagainst the society of hoastmen in 1603 about the raising of the price\r\nof coals in London and the scanty supply, so that “without great\r\ndifficulty the city cannot be provided sufficiently of sea-coals for\r\nthe poor.” The fraternity of hoastmen make a statement of their reasons\r\nconcerning the prices of sea-coals to the Privy Council in answer to\r\nthe complaint of the Mayor and Aldermen. (Newcastle Guilds, 44.)\r\n\r\n[276] The chief objection of the public to the “unreasonable\r\nordinances” by which the crafts closed their corporations was the\r\n“common damage to the people,” probably as tending to raise prices. (P.\r\n102, n. 2.) The Coventry Leet opposed the crafts in this matter.\r\n\r\n[277] These grants were all of early date, in the twelfth century.\r\nAshley, Woollen Industry, 15-17; Madox, 26, 191, etc., 212, etc.,\r\n283-4. The Nottingham weavers paid a rent of 40_s._ for their guild\r\nto the King from the time of Henry the Second. For this they raised a\r\ncontribution from each loom, and obtained a grant that those who paid\r\nmight work in the outskirts of the town. (Nott. Rec. iii. 27, 58, ii.\r\n36.)\r\n\r\n[278] Riley’s Lib. Cus. 130 etc.\r\n\r\n[279] Ibid. 121, 123. The survival of the weavers’ court may be seen in\r\n1321. In certain cases where the bureller was fined by the Mayor, the\r\nweaver was punished by the bailiffs of his own guild. (Ibid. 422-3.)\r\n\r\n[280] Riley’s Lib. Cus. 423.\r\n\r\n[281] In 1327 Edward the Third granted a charter to the girdlers of\r\nLondon, which took in all the girdlers of the kingdom, ordered them\r\nunder the same rules, and set them under the Mayors of whatever city\r\nthey might be in. (Riley’s Mem. 154-5).\r\n\r\n[282] Some charters were given by Edward the Fourth and later Kings\r\nto companies of Tailors, Merchants, and so on, which gave them an\r\nexistence independent of the town, and power to make their own\r\nordinances. (See p. 173.) No list has been made out of these companies,\r\nand the subject needs investigation. From the cases which I have met\r\nwith I think it may probably turn out that such charters were generally\r\ngiven to companies with a foreign trade, and given for reasons\r\nreferring to that trade. The second charter of the Merchant Tailors in\r\n1390 allowed them to make ordinances among themselves and of their own\r\nauthority. (Clode, 3.) This charter seems to have freed them from the\r\nMayor, but if so they were again put under his control in 1436. (Ibid.\r\n5, see pp. 189-191, 193.) This was followed by a violent attempt in\r\n1442 to have a Mayor of their own company, which failed and caused much\r\nanger. It is evident from the charter of Henry the Seventh, in 1502,\r\nwhich confirmed their independence, that they dealt in “all and every\r\nkinds of merchandises” “in all quarters and kingdoms of the world.”\r\n(Ibid. 7, 195.) By this they were again given full power to make\r\nordinances for themselves without interference, so long as these were\r\nnot contrary to the laws of the kingdom nor to the prejudice of the\r\nMayor; and the Mayor was wholly deprived of the power of search among\r\ntheir subjects—a most important measure, since the master and wardens\r\n“had a great number of householders with their servants to rule and\r\ngovern.” (Ibid. 197-200.)\r\n\r\n[283] Though guilds were forbidden in Norwich they existed, doubtless\r\nby the payment of annual fines. In the case of the tanners the\r\ncomplaint in 1287 against them was clearly that in case of disputes\r\nthey “made plaint” to their own aldermen and not to the bailiffs.\r\n(Hudson’s Leet Jurisdiction in Norwich (Selden Soc.) p. 13.) The\r\ncobblers had apparently an important guild from the money paid; the\r\nsaddlers, tanners, and fullers had also guilds in 1292. (Ibid. 39,\r\n42, 43.) The King reserved the power of creating guilds, and it was\r\npossibly to prevent his exercising it that towns like Norwich and\r\nCoventry obtained by charter the right to have no guilds. Such a\r\nprivilege freed them from the fear of fraternities independent of\r\nthe municipality, while it left them free to recognise informally\r\nassociations whose recurring fines were really the tribute paid for\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n[284] Some of those so-called religious, but really trading guilds,\r\nhave been identified. It is clear that the guild of S. Benedict at\r\nLincoln was a society of traders or merchants, who traded on loans from\r\nthe common fund, paying back half of the increase they made on it.\r\n(English Guilds, 174.) Among other instances see the Guild of S. John\r\nBaptist at Hull (Lambert’s Guild Life, 112, etc. 118, 232, 233); Corpus\r\nChristi (ibid. 124); Holy Trinity (ibid. 126.) A very curious and\r\ninteresting account of the formal founding of the Pepperers’ Company as\r\nthe Fraternity of S. Anthony in the Monastery of Bury, 1345, is given\r\nin Kingdon’s Grocers’ Company, i., xvii. Compare the records given on\r\n8-15. It had become the Grocers’ Company by 1373. The Drapers’ Guild in\r\nShrewsbury was originally the Guild of the Trinity. (Hibbert’s Inf. and\r\nDev. of Eng. Guilds, 32.) For other instances see Chapter V. The custom\r\nwas so common in the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries that it is\r\nhighly probable that under any stress of difficulty it would have been\r\nresorted to in earlier days. The artizans must have been fully aware\r\nof the fact disclosed to us by the two forms of summonses for guild\r\nreturns issued in 1388, one for the religious and one for the trading\r\nguilds—the fact that the two forms of association were regarded in a\r\ndifferent way by the government. Some guilds are avowedly of a double\r\ncharacter.

(Blomefield,\r\niii. 125.) A later law enacted that “the worsted shearers in Norwich\r\nshall make no ordinance but such as the Mayor and Alderman shall think\r\nnecessary.” (Stat. 1494, cap. xi.) In the fifteenth century the Privy\r\nCouncil took away from the Bakers’ and Tailors’ Crafts in London\r\nthe right of search in their trades which had been granted to their\r\nWardens, and restored it to the Mayor, and ordered the crafts to obey\r\nthe Mayor after the old usages, customs, and laws of London. 1442.\r\nProceedings Privy Council, v. 196; Seligman, Med.

For Norwich, Blomefield, iii. 130.\r\n\r\n[301] A law of 1413 ordered the registration of charters and approval\r\nof ordinances and bye-laws—a law which was repeated by the Statute\r\nof Henry VI. to prevent the masters of guilds and fraternities making\r\nordinances to the damage of the King or the people, when it was again\r\ndecreed that all their rules should be certified and registered by\r\nJustices of the Peace or by the chief magistrates of cities or towns.\r\n15 Henry VI., cap. 6. See also 19 Henry VII., cap. 7.\r\n\r\n[302] English Guilds, 283-286.\r\n\r\n[303] Ricart, 78. The examples are too numerous to give. But see the\r\nordinances drawn up in 1448 for the Tailors’ Guild of Lynn by the Mayor\r\nand the Council. It was ordered that no new tailor should set up in\r\nbusiness unless he was considered “sufficient in conning” not only by\r\nthe two head men of his craft, but also by the mayor. Every tailor\r\nadmitted to the guild had to pay a fine as entrance fee to the Mayor\r\nand another to the community, as well as his payment to the Guild;\r\nand paid a yearly fee to the town for any sewers and apprentices whom\r\nhe employed. Quarrels between shapers and sewers were to be settled\r\nby the Mayor and the head men of the craft. If a tailor sent home an\r\nill-fitting garment the buyer might bring his complaint to the Mayor’s\r\nCourt, and claim amends before the Mayor and the head men of the craft\r\non condition of paying a fine of 3_s._ 4_d._ if he did not prove his\r\ncase. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 165-6.)\r\n\r\n[304] Miss Dormer Harris has kindly given me the rules at Coventry as\r\nto how a craft was to proceed to the punishment of a member in 1518.\r\nThe master of the craft was first to ask a “reasonable penalty;” if the\r\noffender refused to pay, the master was to apply again after three or\r\nfour days and have the refusal recorded; and in case the refusal was\r\nrepeated a second time he and three or four of the “honest men” of the\r\ncraft were to come to the mayor; and the mayor and one of the justices\r\nwere to command the offender to pay a double penalty; and if he refused\r\nyet again, to commit him to prison until it was paid to the craft. At\r\nthe same time the offender was to desire the master to be “good master\r\nto him and his good lover.” If the penalty were more than would suffice\r\nfor a pound of wax, the remainder was to go to common box, _i.e._, the\r\ncity funds.\r\n\r\n[305] The tilers were strictly ruled by statute as to how the various\r\ntiles should be made, thatch tile, roof tile, gutter tile, and so on;\r\nhow the earth should be prepared and how big the tiles should be.\r\nJustices of the Peace, that is in towns the Mayor and the Aldermen,\r\nwere to hear the cases against offenders and appoint searchers.

In Winchester every bureller had to give one\r\ncloth yearly to the King’s ferm. (English Guilds, 351.)\r\n\r\n[310] Enforced contribution of crafts was common; and the cost\r\nconsiderable. (Gross, ii. 51; Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, p. 166, 225; ibid.\r\nix. 173-5.) See Kingdon, ii. 260, 318, &c. In Coventry there were\r\ncomplaints in 1494 that the dyers, skinners, fishmongers, &c., were so\r\n“self-willed” that they could not be made to contribute to pageants.\r\nSee Hibbert’s Inf. and Dev. of Eng. Gilds, 63. For the whole question\r\nof plays and pageants see Davidson’s Studies in Eng. Mystery Plays,\r\nprinted by Yale University, 1892. The Corpus Christi processions became\r\nafter the order of the Council of Vienne, 1318, exceedingly popular;\r\nthe guilds of Corpus Christi, having charge of the procession, not of\r\nthe plays (91-2), were probably generally composed of the upper class\r\nof people. A list of Miracle Plays and Mysteries has been made for\r\nstudents by F. Stoddard, California University, 1887.\r\n\r\n[311] Von Ochenkowski thinks the relation of municipalities and crafts\r\ndepended on the relative force of the three principles then contending\r\nfor the mastery—feudal rights, the king’s will, and the common law;\r\nin the conflicts between guilds and towns he sees the alternating\r\nforces of the king’s law and of the common law. (Wirthschaftliche\r\nEntwickelung, 59-60.) Many homelier causes than this were probably at\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[312] The surprising number of guilds formed under Richard the Second\r\nand during the next hundred years must strike any one who looks at the\r\ntown records. As a single example see the list given for Shrewsbury\r\nin Hibbert’s Inf. and Dev. of Eng. Gilds, 58-9. In many cases it can\r\nbe proved that the new fraternity was really an old one, but its\r\nre-constitution is as important as a new creation.\r\n\r\n[313] Boys’ Sandwich, 678, 680.\r\n\r\n[314] Hist.

In the same way the notices in 1288, 1301,\r\nand later, of the electing jury do not by any means imply that these\r\nwere its first appearances, and all analogy would point to an opposite\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\n[322] Freeman’s Exeter, 147, 149.\r\n\r\n[323] Mr. Freeman seems to suggest that the Council of Exeter was\r\nformed by the habitual summoning of certain members of the Assembly to\r\nadvise the mayor, and speaks of it as “a committee of the whole body.”\r\n(Ibid. p. 152.)

(Seligman in his Med. Guilds p. 66, quotes Year\r\nBook 49, Edward III. fol. 36.) On the other hand in 1376 the commons\r\npresented a petition complaining that many of the mayors were prevented\r\nfrom exercising their office thoroughly by the special charters which\r\nhad been granted to certain misteries and praying that these special\r\ncharters might be withdrawn so as to strengthen the hands of the local\r\nauthorities.

For\r\ninstances of royal charters to guilds see the Mercers of Shrewsbury\r\n(Hibbert, 64), the Tailors of London (Clode’s Merchant Tailors), and\r\nvarious companies in Hull (Lambert’s Two Thousand Years of Guild Life).\r\n\r\n[346] A curious instance is given in Hull in which one of the county\r\nmagnates made use of the guild as an instrument for getting hold of the\r\nborough representation in Parliament.

The union of crafts in a guild at Walsall\r\n(Gross ii. 248) before 1440 seems to have been very like the union\r\nof crafts at Coventry a century earlier to get control of the town\r\ngovernment, “in eschewing of such great misorder and inconvenience as\r\nhere of late hath fortuned and happened.”\r\n\r\n[349] Carlisle Mun.

Rec. 28, 29,\r\n59). In Beverley the alderman of merchants and twenty-one aldermen of\r\nvarious crafts gave assent in the fifteenth century to ordinances of\r\nthe governors.” (Gross, ii. 23.)\r\n\r\n[351] Gross, ii. 380-3.\r\n\r\n[352] See Chapter XIII. 374-5.\r\n\r\n[353] Gross, i. 111, note 3.

Von Ochenkowski (Wirthschaftliche\r\nEntwickelung, 67) argues that this regulation was made in consequence\r\nof the mediæval view of trade as a public trust not a mere individual\r\nact; and that skill in craft was taken as a test of uprightness of\r\ncharacter and a pledge of fitness for citizenship. From this conclusion\r\nfollows the belief, which in its turn supports the conclusion, that the\r\nrule was one imposed by the town authorities and not by the will of the\r\ncrafts.\r\n\r\n[356] Stubbs, iii. 607.\r\n\r\n[357] This history has been treated by Dr. Gross in his “Gild\r\nMerchant.” In the thirteenth century Merchant Guilds existed in at\r\nleast one-third and probably in a much greater proportion of the\r\nEnglish boroughs. (Gross, i. 2, 22, 158.)\r\n\r\n[358] Ibid. i. 107.\r\n\r\n[359] Gross, i. 74, 107, 108, note 3, 109. There were clergy and women\r\nin the Andover Guild (Ibid. ii. 299, 321); and in Coventry (English\r\nGuilds, 228).\r\n\r\n[360] Gross, i. 66-71, ii. 236.\r\n\r\n[361] Ibid. i. 43, 61, 158-9.\r\n\r\n[362] Ibid. i. 282-3.\r\n\r\n[363] Gross, i. 61-63, 85. Sometimes the grant of a guild was given\r\nbefore the grant of other rights. In other cases it followed. Thus\r\nin Gloucester the first charter was given by Henry the Second “to my\r\nburgesses of Gloucester” in 1155. The Guild did not appear in the\r\ncharter till 1200, when John granted certain municipal rights to “our\r\nburgesses of Gloucester,” and others mainly of a trading sort to “our\r\nburgesses of Gloucester of the Merchant Guild”; and in 1227 a charter\r\nof Henry the Third seems for the first time to enact that burgesses\r\nmust not only dwell in the borough, hold land, and pay lot and scot,\r\nbut must also “be in the Merchant Guild and Hanse.”\r\n\r\n[364] Ibid. i. 43-52, 158-9.\r\n\r\n[365] Ibid. i. 63, 85, 114. “In some places their powers appear to have\r\nbeen gradually enlarged during the thirteenth century so as to embrace\r\njurisdiction in pleas relating to trade.” (Ibid. 65.)\r\n\r\n[366] Ibid. i. 114-115.\r\n\r\n[367] Gross, i. 117, 159-60.\r\n\r\n[368] Ibid. i. 116.\r\n\r\n[369] Dr. Gross holds that all guilds of merchants formed after the\r\ndecline of the Gilda Mercatoria in the thirteenth century must be\r\nconsidered as being merely craft-unions of the ordinary kind—in most\r\ncases superseding the Guild Merchant (i. 129).\r\n\r\n[370] By Dr. Gross’s definition, “What had once been a distinct\r\nintegral part of the civic body politic became vaguely blended with the\r\nwhole of it.” (Gross, i. 159-60, 163.)\r\n\r\n[371] This is stated to have been very rare. (Ibid. p. 114.)\r\n\r\n[372] Ibid. 118, 163. The appellation of the Guild Merchant “was\r\nmore frequently applied to the aggregate of the crafts” than to the\r\ngoverning body of the borough. (Ibid. i. 114.) In Carlisle had the term\r\n“been used at all, _it would probably have been applied_ to the eight\r\nguilds aggregately, rather than to the Corporation.” (Ibid. ii. 40.) In\r\nproving that the later Guild Merchant was “an aggregate of the crafts,”\r\nDr. Gross carries us at a single step into a much later period (pp.\r\n118-123), where the name tells us little apart from the history of the\r\nborough. The case of Coventry seems a doubtful instance.\r\n\r\n[373] Gross, i. 161, 163. Lynn is given as an illustration of this\r\nchange, but the evidence is not adduced.\r\n\r\n[374] Ibid. i. 118. No instance is given of this.\r\n\r\n[375] Dr. Gross argues that any struggle which did take place was not\r\nbetween the Guild Merchant and the crafts, but between “the governing\r\ncouncil (the “magnates,” “potentiores,” etc.) on the one side and the\r\nburgesses at large (“communitas,” “populus,” “minores”) on the other.”\r\n(Gross i. 110, 285.) The “magnates” of Norwich (Hudson’s Mun. Org.\r\np. 24-5), or “les riches” of the city records, ruled in a city where\r\nthere was no Guild Merchant. The “potentiores” of Lynn seem from the\r\nprinted records to have been the Guild Merchant. In the town records\r\n“communitas” cannot be understood as synonymous with “populus,” still\r\nless with “minores.”\r\n\r\n[376] Gross, i. 109. “Not a single unmistakable example of such a\r\nconflict has ever been deduced.” On this point Seligman (Mediæval\r\nGuilds, 57-8) speaks very dogmatically on most inconclusive evidence,\r\nso far as this is given in his notes. The analogy on p. 58 of craft\r\nguilds including smaller unions is not shewn, nor their common\r\noccurrence proved.\r\n\r\n[377] In London, Norwich, and the Cinque Ports, there was no Guild\r\nMerchant at any time. In Lynn, Andover, Southampton, and Bristol it was\r\nall-powerful. In Nottingham no influence of its action can be traced;\r\nthe guild mentioned in John’s charter (Nott. Rec. i. 9) is only once\r\nmentioned afterwards, in 1365. (Ibid. i. 189.)\r\n\r\n[378] Gross, i. 107.\r\n\r\n[379] See Lynn, Gross, ii. 157. Southampton, ibid. 216-226.

Is there any reason to think that if the enjoyment\r\nof monopoly was split up and divided among the crafts, the exercize of\r\nauthority was split up and transferred in the same proportions?\r\n\r\n[388] When wealthy individuals of a craft, men perhaps almost in the\r\nposition of merchants, were admitted to the Guild, no argument can be\r\ndrawn from this as to the relation of the craft itself to the Guild.\r\n\r\n[389] Gross, i. 114-5. In the instances here given (p. 116, note 1) of\r\nregulations made for craftsmen by the Guild Merchant it is necessary\r\nto define the exact relation between the Guild and the governing body\r\nof the town. (See Andover in 1314. Gross, ii. 308. Compare Leicester,\r\nibid. 144.)\r\n\r\n[390] Gross, i. 125-6, 159-60.\r\n\r\n[391] Ibid. i. 75, 76.\r\n\r\n[392] All the materials which I have used in speaking of Coventry have\r\nbeen given me very kindly by Miss Dormer Harris, who has made a careful\r\nstudy of the town records on the spot, and will soon, it is hoped,\r\npublish the result of her researches.\r\n\r\n[393] Compare Chesterfield, where a Guild was established in 1218 to\r\nguard the “liberties of the town”; in case of need its aldermen were to\r\nchoose twelve men to go before the justices or elsewhere to help these\r\n“liberties” of the town; and any one suffering loss for them was to be\r\nrepaid by the Guild. (English Guilds, 165-167.)\r\n\r\n[394] Compare the very small numbers of the Reading Guild, which was\r\na survival of olden times (Vol. I. p. 302, note 1). S. Alban’s was\r\nlarger, but apparently of a more doubtful character, even in the eyes\r\nof the prudent burghers. (Ibid. 296-7.)\r\n\r\n[395] They got land from Isabella, and built their church at\r\nBablake—the first church built by the burghers.\r\n\r\n[396] The taking of a common name may have been connected with the\r\nlicense to mortmain. S. John’s Guild had got a license in 1342 and land\r\nto build its church, but some extended license must have been needed\r\nfor a larger society which desired to possess new property.\r\n\r\n[397] Mercers’ obits were celebrated in S. Catherine’s Chapel; drapers’\r\nobits usually in the Lady Chapel belonging to S. Mary’s or the Merchant\r\nGuild.\r\n\r\n[398] The early guildhall of York belonged to the guilds of S. George\r\nand S. Christopher; and when the new hall was built in the middle of\r\nthe fifteenth century these two guilds retained considerable power in\r\nit. (Davies’ Walks Through York, 49-51.) Sir William Plumpton and his\r\nwife joined the fraternity of S. Christopher at York, 1439. (Plumpton\r\nCorr. lxii.)\r\n\r\n[399] Cf. Norwich (p. 395). This arrangement was probably made for the\r\nsake of financial security (see p. 215-6).\r\n\r\n[400] English Gilds, 232.\r\n\r\n[401] Accounts of the Guild of Corpus Christi are preserved from 1488.\r\nThe brethren and sisters of the Guild seem to have been spread all\r\nover England, and are mentioned at London, Lynn, and Birmingham. They\r\nwere of all ranks and of all trades and callings. (Hist. MSS. Com. i.\r\n101.) The Prior of the cathedral, the Prior’s bailiff, the vicar of\r\nTrinity, various craftsmen of the town and vicars of the neighbourhood,\r\nmerchants of Queenborough, Dublin, Drogheda, Bristol, Kingston-on-Hull,\r\nLondon, and many other places, a “merchant of the Staple,” and great\r\nmen of the neighbourhood, such as Thomas Grey, the Marquis of Dorset,\r\nLord Hastings, and others belonged to its association.\r\n\r\n[402] S. Mary’s Hall was begun in 1340, and finished in 1413.\r\n\r\n[403] The Twenty-four were self-elected; the mayor was elected by the\r\nTwenty-four; the common council were appointed and summoned by the\r\nmayor.\r\n\r\n[404] Compare the case of Southampton where a guild merchant had\r\nimposed its methods on a town government.\r\n\r\n[405] The list compiled in 1449 of living craftsmen who had held office\r\ngives fifteen drapers and eleven mercers, and seven dyers; as against\r\ntwo wire-drawers, two whit-tawyers, and two weavers. The dyers in\r\nCoventry were often cloth merchants of great consequence.\r\n\r\n[406] In the time of Richard the Second the fullers and tailors first\r\nattempted to form a guild, and even obtained a patent which licensed\r\ntheir society to hold property worth a yearly rental of eight marks.\r\n\r\n[407] The complaint against the dyers is shown in a petition to\r\nParliament in 1415 (Rot. Parl. iv. 75), in which the community of\r\nCoventry say that by reason of a confederacy among the dyers they\r\ncannot get their cloth dyed under 6_s._ or 7_s._ a dozen, whereas last\r\nyear’s price was 5_s._; and forty pounds of wool was now 30_s._ which\r\nwas last year 20_s._, &c. The dyers are also great and common makers\r\nof cloth and take all the flower of the wool for their own cloth, the\r\nremnant serving the common people. The petitioners request that on the\r\nday of the mayor’s election, those that elect him (that is twenty-four\r\nmembers of the ruling guilds) shall also appoint four persons, two\r\ndrapers, one dyer, and one woder, sworn to keep watch over the dyers,\r\nand present them for any “fault or confederacy” to the mayor, bailiffs,\r\nand justices of the peace—in other words to the officers of the\r\nTrinity Guild. For the first fault he was to pay a fine to the king,\r\nfor the second a fine and half a year’s imprisonment. They also prayed\r\nthat no one who was a dyer should make vendible cloth. These conditions\r\nbeing refused they claimed the suppression of the guild.\r\n\r\n[408] The mayor and his brethren carried their complaint to the king\r\nin 1424, and by royal writ the assemblies were forbidden. In 1422 the\r\ngoverning guilds issued an order that all wardens should bring the\r\nordinances of the crafts before the mayor, recorder, and bailiffs, and\r\neight of the general council by whom honest, lawful, and good rules\r\nshould be allowed; and no ordinances might be made against the law in\r\noppression of people, upon pain of imprisonment or fine at the king’s\r\nwill. In 1424 arbitrators were appointed by the mayor’s order to decide\r\nthe disputes between the master weavers and their men; and rules were\r\ndrawn up for the whole craft. It is obvious that this is very different\r\nfrom regulation by a guild which still retained the crafts within its\r\nown association.\r\n\r\n[409] They gave forty marks for a fresh license for their guild with\r\nmortmain up to ten marks, and leave to elect four masters at the\r\nNativity to rule the craft and to plead in courts for the whole body.\r\nAs of old they seem to have failed in carrying out their scheme in\r\nspite of the license, and in 1448 a petition was presented by them\r\n(whether it was voluntary may well be doubted) that the union between\r\nthe fullers’ and tailors’ crafts should be severed. At the suppression\r\nof the guilds the shearmen and tailors held a mill and tenements in\r\nmortmain for the support of their chauntry.\r\n\r\n[410] Cf. Exeter, Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n[411] How little freedom was left to far the most powerful craft of\r\nall—the dyers—we see from the law of 1530, that if any masters and\r\njourneymen of the dyers can be proved before the mayor and justices\r\nto have hindered any one from becoming a dyer, they are to be fined.\r\nIf the journeymen refuse to work for the new dyers, then, without\r\nhindrance from the craft or the journeymen, they may hire others not\r\ninhabitants. In 1530 it was ordered that a certain Robert Perkins was\r\nto become a dyer without “let or hindrance” from craft and journeymen.\r\nIn general the corporation resisted the tendency of the lesser crafts\r\nto prevent the setting up of new masters—a policy which is easy\r\nto understand in the rule of merchants, as opposed to that of the\r\nmanufacturers.\r\n\r\n[412] Posted up on the door of S. Michael’s in 1494:—\r\n\r\n“Be it knowen and understood This cite should be free and now is bond\r\nDame Goode-Eve made hit free And now the’ be customes for woll and the\r\ndrap’ie. Also hit is made that no prentice shall be But XIII. penies\r\npay shall he, This act did Robert Grene Therefore he had many a curse I\r\nwene.”\r\n\r\n(Sharp’s Antiquities, 235.)\r\n\r\n\r\n[413]\r\n\r\n“This city is bond that shuld be free, The right is holden from the\r\n̄C̄īalte. Our cōins that at Lamas open shuld be cast They be closed\r\nin and hegged full fast.... If ever ye have nede to the cōīalte Such\r\nfavour as ye show us such shall ye see. We may speke fair and bid ye\r\ngood morwe But luff from our herts ye shall have nevr.... Cherish the\r\ncōīalte and so they have their right For drede of a worse chance by day\r\nor by night. The best of all littel worth shuld be And ye had not had\r\nhelp of the cōīalte.”\r\n\r\n(Sharp, 235.) Perhaps it was from the talk of the streets in some such\r\nlocal disturbance that Langland quoted when he wrote the lines quoted\r\nin Vol. I. p. 26.\r\n\r\n[414] The Coventry craft-masters’ apprentices paid their fines to the\r\nmayor “for the use of the city,” not of the guild; the “searchers” for\r\nthe trades were appointed and the regulations made at the Leet Court,\r\nnot at meetings of a guild; the same officials attended, but they had\r\nto act as representing the municipality.\r\n\r\n[415] As in Lynn, Bristol, and, later, Norwich.\r\n\r\n[416] It is a subject for inquiry whether any Guild Merchant gave\r\nits name to a municipality unless it had been made responsible for\r\nthe payment of the ferm, and held openly and to the knowledge of the\r\nexchequer some property or rents or tolls for the purpose.\r\n\r\n[417] The Coventry Guild held town property for public purposes before\r\nthis, apparently as a private arrangement.\r\n\r\n[418] It is possible that in the earlier part of Richard’s reign the\r\nfear inspired by the Peasant Revolt may have quickened the spirit of\r\norganization among the wealthier classes. In the Guild of Lichfield,\r\nestablished by charter in 1387, the master of the Guild and the\r\nForty-eight were “steadfastly to abide together and see that good rule\r\nbe kept in the city.” (Gross, ii. 145.) Similar combinations of the\r\nricher classes seem to have been very general.\r\n\r\n[419] English Gilds, 244-6, 249, 250.\r\n\r\n[420] Gross, ii. 353.\r\n\r\n[421] Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 316. This states that all the burgesses and\r\nthe commonalty of the borough of Bridgewater have ordained that they\r\nwill choose yearly two seneschals of their guild, and one bailiff to\r\nattend on them; such seneschals to have power to punish those offending\r\nagainst these ordinances. If any one among them shall maliciously\r\nimpute to another a charge of theft, forgery, neifty (“nativitatis,”\r\nthe being a born bondman), murder, adultery, or excommunication, and be\r\nconvicted thereof before the seneschals, he shall be amerced and bound\r\nto the commonalty to make satisfaction to the other at the award of\r\nhis peers. No one shall implead another without the borough under pain\r\nof amercement. Any one neglecting to appear before the seneschals when\r\nsummoned is to be amerced. Those opposing execution or distress made by\r\norder of the seneschals to be amerced and bound to the commonalty in\r\nforty pence. No one is to buy flesh or fish before 9 A.M. for regrating\r\nunder pain of becoming bound to the commonalty in the price of the\r\nflesh or fish so bought or sold. If any one is elected to the office of\r\nseneschal of S. Mary’s or of the Holy Cross in the church of the said\r\nborough he shall render account for the moneys arising therefrom to the\r\nsaid seneschals whenever summoned so to do. Any person refusing any one\r\nof those offices, if elected thereto, is to be bound to the commonalty\r\nin the sum of 6_s._ 8_d._ The seneschals are to render account for all\r\nmoneys received by them each year upon the morrow of the circumcision\r\nof our Lord. This deed has a large fragment of the castle seal or seal\r\nof the lord of the fee still attached. (Hist. MSS. Com. iii. 316.)\r\n\r\n[422] Their meetings for business were held in a small chamber attached\r\nto the church of S.

Dr. Gross (i. 83-4, note 11) gives the names of some towns\r\nwhere the government was guided by a “simple social-religious gild.”\r\nThe instances suggest different problems, and need separate examination\r\nof the special circumstances.\r\n\r\n[423] Madox, 217. How many later declarations of the poverty of\r\n_corporations_ was due to this convenient system of dealing with their\r\nfunds?\r\n\r\n[424] This system was devised before the doctrine of Trusts was\r\nadopted, in the reign of Henry the Fourth; but even after that doctrine\r\nwas accepted the holding of property by a friendly corporation would\r\nhave put considerable difficulty in the way of recovering money owed by\r\nthe municipality.\r\n\r\n[425] English Gilds, 231-5.\r\n\r\n[426] See Note A at end of Chapter.\r\n\r\n[427] See Chapter XIV.\r\n\r\n[428] Dr. Gross is one of the latest writers who insists especially on\r\nthe passage from democracy to oligarchy.

If a townsman struck the mayor and\r\nwas too harshly punished the friends of the prisoner might call a jury\r\n“of the discreetest and stoutest men of the city,” who should ordain a\r\njust penalty. In Rye as in Hereford the old custom was that the man who\r\nstruck the mayor was to lose his right hand (Lyon’s Dover, ii. 352);\r\nin Preston there was some punishment for a mayor who struck a burgess\r\nin or out of court (Custumal, Hist. Preston Guild). In Canterbury if a\r\nbailiff did wrong to any “that may be found by two lawful men of syght\r\nand of hyerth” complaint was made to the twelve aldermen; and if they\r\ncharged the bailiff in vain to amend the wrong, the case was carried to\r\na court of the thirty-six, the aldermen, and the most wisest men, “and\r\nby them right shall be ordained” (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 171).\r\n\r\n[436] Hist. MSS. Com. v. 559.\r\n\r\n[437] Hunt’s Bristol, 103-5.\r\n\r\n[438] For the variety of modes in which juries were elected then and\r\nlater see Rep. Mun.

MSS. Com. ix. 169); and groups of umpires appointed to\r\nsettle differences (Boys’ Sandwich, 786).\r\n\r\n[440] This was the custom in Exeter. At Bayonne every new citizen was\r\nsworn upon a book containing the charter and statutes of the commune\r\n(Luchaire, 47).\r\n\r\n[441] Ricart, 2.\r\n\r\n[442] At Wycombe and Dartmouth two Italian copies of the Pandects of\r\nJustinian and commentaries were used in the fifteenth century to bind\r\nup the corporation books.\r\n\r\n[443] See pp. 310-11, 334-6, 366-70. A decree of 1328 in Preston was\r\nmade by “the mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, with all the commonalty,\r\nby a whole assent and consent.” (Thomson, Mun. Hist. 105.)\r\n\r\n[444] Mr. Maitland describes the communal organization of the villein\r\ntenants on the manor of Bright Waltham in 1293 (Manorial Pleas, Selden\r\nSoc. 161-4, 168). They formed a “communitas” which held property,\r\ncould receive a grant of land, could contract and make exchanges with\r\nthe lord (172). These rights were recognized in the manorial courts,\r\nthough at Westminster they would have been held very irregular (163).\r\nThey elected or recommended the reeve, shepherd, ploughman, swineherd\r\n(170), the whole ville “undertaking” for him (168). The steward kept\r\nwatch that no land of servile tenure should be treated as free, and the\r\nvilleins themselves were very unwilling that a villein should set up as\r\na freeman on the ground of holding a freehold acre (164).\r\n\r\n[445] In Barnstaple a deed concerning a tenement in the High Street in\r\n1416 was sealed with the seal of the commonalty, not that of the mayor.\r\n(Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 213.) In Rye there was a seal of the community\r\ndifferent from the mayor’s seal, which last was first used in 1377.\r\n(Ibid. v. 489, 511.)

Thus, in Haverford\r\nWest, where the townsfolk up to 1832 took a very real part in the\r\nelection of their officers and the control of business, the common\r\nmeadow still contained over a thousand acres. (Report on Mun.\r\nCorporation, 233, etc.) And at Berwick-on-Tweed, where also affairs\r\nwere administered by the whole body of burgesses, the annual value of\r\nthe lands whose profits went to the freemen was near £6,000.

The records of the Manchester Court\r\nLeet Jury have only been preserved from 1552. The number varied from\r\nabout fourteen to eighteen, who were yearly chosen at the court leets\r\nfrom the chief burgesses of the town. When the father died his eldest\r\nson or younger brother seems to have been made a juror in his stead.\r\nThe jurors, in fact, were chosen generation after generation from the\r\nsame small number of families. The reeve and one or both constables\r\nwere generally nominated from among the jury then in the box.\r\n(Manchester Court Leet Records, 177-8.) Cf. Ship of Fools. Barclay, 99.\r\n\r\n[469] Ibid. 62. See Vol. I. 186, 165, note A. In Canterbury there\r\nwas a law that if by the bailiff’s fault the king should send a writ\r\n“in hindering of the liberty” of the town the bailiff should make\r\nrestitution.\r\n\r\n[470] In Colchester for example the number of people assessed for all\r\nmoveables in 1301 was 390 and the sum raised £24 12_s._ 6_d._ In 1377,\r\nwhen it stood twelfth on the list of English towns, it is said to have\r\nhad about 4,500 inhabitants.\r\n\r\n[471] Thus in 1342 Nicholas Langton was elected mayor of York for the\r\nseventeenth time (Hargrove’s York, i. 308) and two men bore rule in\r\nLiverpool for eighteen years between 1374 and 1406—one for twelve\r\nyears and the other for six (Picton’s Liverpool, i. 30).\r\n\r\n[472] There was a great variety in the names of mayors during the\r\nfifteenth century. John Samon held the office several times, but\r\ngenerally speaking the mayors were not re-elected, and in no case did\r\nthey hold office two years in succession.

See also entries in the records made by\r\nRoger Bramston, mayor of Wycombe, in 1490.\r\n\r\n[495] The possible difficulty of getting rid of a clerk is illustrated\r\nby what happened when the mayor, sheriffs, alderman, and commons of\r\nYork, in 1475, by their whole and common assent, dismissed the common\r\nclerk “for divers and many offences—excessive takings of money,\r\nmisguiding of their books, accounts, and evidences, with other great\r\ntrespasses.” They then wrote to D. of Gloucester to entreat his good\r\nlordship and that he would move the king to allow them to name another\r\ncommon clerk; and the Duke having sent letters to Lord Hastings and\r\nLord Stanley, finally received an answer from the king that he had\r\ncommissioned two serjeants of the law to examine the case, that they\r\nhad reported in favour of the corporation, and that a new clerk might\r\nbe elected. The grateful town agreed at a meeting of the council that\r\nthe D. of Gloucester “for his great labour now late made unto the\r\nking’s great grace” should “be presented at his coming to the city with\r\n6 swans and 6 pikes.” (Davies’ York, 53-55.)\r\n\r\n[496] Hist. MSS. Com. vi. 603. In Hereford the steward might be a\r\n“foreigner who is known of the citizens.” (Journ. Arch. Ass. xxvii.\r\n463-4.)\r\n\r\n[497] In Sandwich the “town clerk’s” salary was 40_s._ a year, out of\r\nwhich he had to find parchment, except when he wrote out the cesses,\r\nwhen the commonalty might give him a shilling or two for the parchment\r\nand his trouble. Other small payments fell to him when a freeman was\r\nmade or a corporation letter was signed or suchlike business done.\r\n(Boys’ Sandwich, 476.) In 1390 Romney paid as much as 56_s._ 8_d._;\r\nthen the salary fell to 40_s._ in 1428; then to 32_s._ 11_d._; and then\r\nto 26_s._ 8_d._, with 3_s._ 4_d._ for parchment. (Ibid. 803.) This\r\ncorresponded with the decline in the fortunes of Romney.\r\n\r\n[498] The common clerk at Hythe, John Smallwood, secured for himself a\r\nfollowing of thirty-six men sworn to help him in all his undertakings,\r\nand in 1397 he had even gathered sixty men pledged to bring about the\r\ndeath of four of his enemies. For four years the town refused to have\r\nany clerk at all, until at last Smallwood made his peace in 1414 by\r\nthe gift of certain tenements and lands. (Hist. MSS. Com. iv. part 1,\r\n437-8.)\r\n\r\n[499] Davies’ York, 207. Thomas Atwood, who was town clerk of\r\nCanterbury in 1497, seems to have been mayor in 1500.

The main effect of the new charters was\r\nsimply to make the rate of progress apparent, and to some extent to\r\nhelp it forward by the mere process of reducing everything to formal\r\nlegal arrangement, thus incidentally destroying vague liberties, or\r\nhardening the exercise of them into a fixed form which had lost all\r\nelasticity.\r\n\r\n[505] Piers Ploughman. Passus ix. 174.\r\n\r\n[506]\r\n\r\n“But while Hunger was their master would none chide, Ne strive against\r\nthe Statute, he looked so stern.”\r\n\r\nIbid. Passus ix. 342, 343.\r\n\r\n\r\n[507] Occasionally we find odd instances of growing independence.\r\nIn Worcester “at some seasons of wilfulness” the people had shewn\r\ntheir revolutionary temper by choosing for serjeants and constables\r\n“persons of worship, to the dishonour of them and of the said city;”\r\nand an ordinance was made in 1467 that none of the twenty-four or the\r\nforty-eight might be appointed to these offices. (English Guilds, 409.)\r\nIn like manner the great court of Bridgenorth decreed in 1503 that no\r\nburgess should be made serjeant. (Hist. MSS. Com. x. 4, 426.) In 1350 a\r\nguild was formed in Lincoln of “common and middling folks” who strongly\r\nobjected to any one joining them “of the rank of mayor or bailiffs,”\r\nor claiming dignity for his personal rank, and made a rule that if any\r\nsuch persons insisted on entering their society they should not meddle\r\nwith its business and should never be appointed officers. (English\r\nGuilds, 178-9.)\r\n\r\n[508] Piers Ploughman. Pass. xviii. 88.\r\n\r\n[509] The differences of early charters should all be studied. See, for\r\nexample, the charters of Nottingham and Northampton given in the same\r\nyear (Stubbs’s Charters, 300-302).\r\n\r\n[510] The complexity and apparently inexhaustible confusion of their\r\nmethods is well illustrated by the lists drawn up in 1833 by the\r\ncommissioners appointed to inquire into municipal corporations. See\r\nappendix to the Rep. on Mun. Corpor. 94, 95; and especially the tables\r\non pp. 102-132. Evidently the burghers have scarcely deserved the\r\nreproach of those who consider direct election by the people as the\r\nnatural rude expedient of unlearned men grouped in political societies\r\nand ignorant of the wiser system of nomination which commends itself to\r\ntrained legislators.\r\n\r\n[511] Kitchin’s Winchester, 164.\r\n\r\n[512] P. 306.\r\n\r\n[513] Municipal Corporations Report, 21.\r\n\r\n[514] The modes of election of sheriffs and bailiffs were as various\r\nand complicated as those of mayor and council. For illustrations of\r\nthis see Rep. on Mun. Corp. 24, 25.\r\n\r\n[515] There was also a “Great Court” of twenty-four. Hist. MSS. Com.\r\nx. part 4, pp. 425-7. At Melcombe Regis (Hist. MSS. Com. v. 578) there\r\nwas an electing jury of twelve. In Preston the mayor chose in open\r\ncourt two ancient discreet and honest burgesses, who took an oath that\r\nthey would at once select twenty-four burgesses who should not bear any\r\noffice in the town during the next year. The twenty-four having been\r\nchosen and sworn, elected a mayor, a bailiff, and a sub-bailiff; these\r\nthree at once took their respective oaths, and the mayor before he left\r\nthe hall appointed a mayor’s bailiff and a serjeant. Laws were made\r\nby the “mayor, bailiffs, and burgesses, with all the commonalty, by a\r\nwhole assent and consent.” Government seems to have been carried on by\r\nthe mayor and “twelve of those who with him are ordained,” and who were\r\nknown as aldermen or capital burgesses. By a guild law earlier than\r\n1328 former mayors and bailiffs, though they might sit on the bench\r\nas aldermen, were not allowed to meddle with the twenty-four during\r\nthe election, under penalty of a fine of twenty shillings or loss of\r\ncitizenship. (Preston, Guild Record, xxiv. Guild ordinances in history\r\nof Preston Guild, by Dobson and Harland, 12, 17, 19-23.)\r\n\r\n[516] To illustrate the variety of town constitutions I have given\r\nthree or four, taken at random, in an Appendix at the end of the\r\nchapter. Other instances will be found in Chapters. XII.-XVI.\r\n\r\n[517] See note A, p. 283, Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 171-2. This plan was\r\nperhaps modelled on a system common in ecclesiastical elections\r\nand possibly peculiar in Canterbury so far as municipalities were\r\nconcerned. There was a dispute in 1435 about the mode of presentation\r\nto S. Peter’s, Cornhill, to avoid the “great strife and controversy”\r\nbetween the mayor, aldermen, and common council. It was decided that\r\nthe mayor and aldermen should choose four priests living within the\r\ncity or a mile of it; that these four should name to the common\r\ncouncil four clerks “most meet in manners and conyng”; and that out of\r\nthese four the mayor, aldermen, and council should choose one.

In Southampton twelve “discreets,” p. 308. The jurats\r\nin Romney and others of the Cinque Ports formed a similar body. So\r\nalso in Carlisle, and in Pontefract. (Hist. MSS. Com. viii. 270-1.) A\r\nwrit from the privy council was addressed to “the mayor, bailiffs, and\r\ntwenty-four notablest burgesses of our town of Northampton” in 1442.\r\n(Proceed. Privy Council v. 191.) Wells had a council of twenty-four.\r\n(Hist. MSS. Com. i. 106-7.)\r\n\r\n[520] Oxford, by a charter of Richard the First, had a mayor and two\r\naldermen. In 1255 Henry the Third made the aldermen four, corresponding\r\nto the four wards of the city, and joined with them eight leading\r\nburgesses mainly to keep peace in the city and to have charge of the\r\nassize of bread, beer, and wine. The twenty-four common councilmen\r\nwere elected from the citizens at large. (Boase’s Oxford, 42-44.) In\r\nIpswich besides the twelve “honest and loyal” portmen elected yearly\r\nin the cemetery of S. Mary Tower there was a council of twenty-four;\r\nand seven of the portmen and thirteen of the twenty-four could together\r\nmake rules for the town. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 242, 244.) In Yarmouth\r\n(Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 305; Blomefield, xi. 301-2, 342), twenty-four\r\njurats (afterwards called aldermen) were chosen by the burgesses, and\r\nappointed all the officers of the town. Between 1400 and 1407 changes\r\nwere made in the constitution. Two bailiffs were elected instead of\r\nfour, and besides the council of twenty-four aldermen a common council\r\nwas formed of forty-eight members. So also in Colchester and Norwich.\r\nWorcester had two councils, “the twenty-four above and the forty-eight\r\nbeneath.” (English Guilds, 379, 396. Also Leicester, Hist. MSS. Com.\r\nviii. 425.) Canterbury had an upper council of twelve and another of\r\nthirty-six. (Hist. MSS. Com. ix. 171-2.) For councils of seventy and\r\neighty see pp. 374, 432. In Chester a charter of 1506 gave twenty-four\r\naldermen and forty of the common council. (Hist. MSS. Com. viii.\r\n359-60.) In Bristol (Hunt’s Bristol, 85-86) and Liverpool (Picton\r\nii. 26) the council was composed of forty “honest and discreet” men.\r\nColchester had two councils of sixteen each. (Cromwell’s Colchester,\r\n265.)\r\n\r\n[521] The manner in which the aldermen took their place in the system\r\nof municipal government has not yet been worked out. In London,\r\nCanterbury, and Lincoln they were hereditary owners of the various\r\nwards. The people of Coventry petitioned for aldermen over the wards in\r\n1450, but the mayor and his brethren refused. In Lynn there were only\r\nconstables of the wards.\r\n\r\n[522] Hist. MSS.

Archers sent to the castle for the defence of\r\nthe townsmen were charged to their account, and they had to submit\r\npatiently to their exactions; a letter from Edward the Fourth ordered\r\nthe town to release one of the Bowers who had been committed to prison\r\n“for his inordinate demeaning,” and to go on paying him his wages like\r\nother Bowers.

In 1463 a mayor of Southampton was deposed by\r\nthe King’s mandamus (Ibid. 168).\r\n\r\n[568] Davies speaks of this John Ingoldsby who paid the debt as\r\nafterwards apparently one of the Barons of the Exchequer (p. 38.) A\r\nJohn Ingoldsby had been Recorder of Southampton from at least 1444 (p.\r\n185) to at least 1459 (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 113) and very probably\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n[569] Davies, 36. Hist. MSS.

(Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 42-3.)\r\n\r\n[573] The Southampton trade did in fact utterly fail before a century\r\nwas over. In 1530 its rent was reduced by £26 13_s._ _d._, and in 1552\r\nthe King ordered that when the customs at the port did not amount to\r\n£200, and no ships called carracks of Genoa and galleys of Venice\r\nshould enter the port to load or unload, the town should not pay the\r\naccustomed rent of £200, but only £50. To this day certificates are\r\nstill prepared every year on November 9th that no carracks of Genoa nor\r\ngalleys of Venice have arrived at the port. (Davies, 38-9. Hist. MSS.\r\nCom. xi. 3, 49.)\r\n\r\n[574] Unfortunately in the brief extracts from the Southampton records\r\nwhich have been as yet published, references to municipal government\r\nare so scanty that any sketch of it can only be drawn in faint and\r\nuncertain outline. In the opinion of Dr. Gross the Merchant Guild was\r\noriginally a strictly private fraternity, and only became the dominant\r\nburghal authority in the fourteenth century. (Gross, ii. 231.)

(Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, p. 11.)\r\n\r\n[595] Davies, 155. It is possible that at this time the chief aldermen\r\nwere fashioned into a close body elected for life after the pattern of\r\nLondon; at any rate soon after this we find them and their wives in the\r\northodox scarlet robes with fur and velvet, in all points the same as\r\nthose of the mayor. 235.\r\n\r\n[596] Davies, 63, 71-2, 125.\r\n\r\n[597] Gross, ii. 225. Davies (p. 136) says that whenever the guild\r\nbecame settled as the supreme authority, there entered at that period\r\nan element of restriction alien from the more ancient government of\r\nthe towns; and traces to the guild the narrowing of common privileges\r\nand subjection of the community to an exclusive system of local\r\nadministration. It is possible that wherever a guild merchant did\r\nlay hold on a town government, as here, at Lynn, or at Coventry, the\r\ntendency may always have been to intensify the existing tendencies to\r\nthe despotic rule of the richer citizens.\r\n\r\n[598] Hist.

In Nottingham, as\r\nin Southampton, we have an occasional indication that the burgesses\r\nor common councillors, possibly under some fit of impatience at the\r\npretensions of the aldermen, had intermittent tendencies to side with\r\nthe people. In Southampton there was possibly at this time a certain\r\nbond of sympathy, for seven years earlier, in 1452, the burgesses\r\ncomplained that the aldermen had assumed the right of retaining, as\r\njustices of the peace, fines which had always gone to them towards\r\nthe payment of the ferm; and their contention having been maintained\r\nin Parliament, royal orders were sent to the aldermen to molest the\r\nburgesses no more. Davies, 156.\r\n\r\n[601] Davies, 164, 165.\r\n\r\n[602] Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, p. 104.

In the\r\nnext century a man was fined, because “being a bachelor and not keeping\r\nhouse, he ought not to keep any cattle at all” on it.\r\n\r\n[608] The hospital had made encroachments and put up fences in 1438,\r\nwhich the then mayor had broken down (Davies, 52).\r\n\r\n[609] Davies, 53.\r\n\r\n[610] Ibid. 53.

The latest grant of the public land of Southampton was made on\r\nSept. 16th, 1892, by the Mayor and corporation for a graving dock—part\r\nof the harbour improvements by which Southampton is to be restored to\r\nits old supremacy on the southern coast and once more to give room in\r\nits port to the largest steamers afloat. There was a far-away echo of\r\nold world controversies in the assurance of the mayor to the people\r\nthat by this act of the corporation in giving the land at a nominal\r\nconsideration there was scarcely anybody in Southampton who would not\r\nbe benefited, and “not a soul in Southampton would be injured.”\r\n\r\n[615] In the following century we find them making presentments at the\r\nCourt Leet about the mayor’s misdoings (Davies, 123).\r\n\r\n[616] As the King’s servant orders were sent direct to him without\r\nmention of the community.

There is a mortgage of rent\r\nof certain tolls by the “mayor and community,” 1315. Ibid. i. 84.\r\nSettlement as to common pasture by “mayor, burgesses, and community,”\r\ni. 150. Lease in 1390 by “mayor, chamberlains, and all the burgesses\r\nwith the assent and will of the entire community,” iii. 425. For\r\nsimilar phrases in 1401 and 1416 iii. 425-6; ii. 106-8. In 1435, ii.\r\n362. In 1443, ii. 408. In 1444, ii. 424. In 1451, iii. 408. In 1467,\r\nii. 269. In 1479 land bequeathed to “mayor, sheriffs, burgesses, and\r\nmen of Nottingham,” ii. 304-6, 307. For 1480, ii. 420. In 1482 an\r\nagreement about the Retford tolls is settled by “the mayor and his\r\nbrethren and the commonalty of Nottingham,” iii. 427. There is an\r\nextreme particularity in the phrase used in 1485, ii. 353. For a lease\r\nof land in 1494, iii. 431. For 1504, iii. 325-6.\r\n\r\n[665] We may compare this with the Council of Southampton; see pp.\r\n308-11.\r\n\r\n[666] In 1435 we read of the mayor, and nine, or possibly eleven,\r\nburgesses named “and many other commons in the said hall,” (Nott. Rec.\r\nii. 362.) In 1443 there is something very like the council—the mayor,\r\nfour justices of the peace named, John Orgram and other “trustworthy\r\nmen” of the town, and the two chamberlains, who acted “with the assent\r\nof the whole community of the town.” (Ibid. ii. 408.) For the fine see\r\nii. 424.\r\n\r\n[667] Ibid. ii. 424.\r\n\r\n[668] The editor of the Records, Mr. Stevenson, accepts this statement\r\nof Gregory, and says that “The council had no existence prior to 1446,\r\nand it was at first merely a committee appointed by the burgesses\r\nfor the management of the affairs of the town.” According to him the\r\ntownspeople were accustomed to assemble for the discussion of any\r\nimportant business, and “this was the system of government in use\r\nprior to the establishment of this committee in 1446.” (Nott. Rec. iv.\r\nix.) He believes further that “it was, no doubt, the abuses arising\r\nfrom this system and the inconvenience of having to call a meeting of\r\nthe whole community for the consideration of every question connected\r\nwith the ruling of the town that caused the burgesses to choose the\r\ncommittee of 1446.” (Ibid. xi.)\r\n\r\n[669] Ibid. iv. xi.\r\n\r\n[670] Nott. Rec. ii. 362, 425, 420. The right of the burgesses to ask\r\nfor the calling of a common hall is admitted in iii. 342.\r\n\r\n[671] Ibid. ii. 186 _et sq._ There are passages in the charter which\r\nseem to convey this impression. In 1465 Elizabeth Woodville confirms a\r\ncharter to “the mayor, sheriffs, burgesses, and men of the town,” by\r\nwhatsoever name they might be incorporated and known (ii. 255-7).\r\n\r\n[672] Ibid. ii. 202-4. For boundaries of wards see iv. 174.\r\n\r\n[673] Ibid. ii. 425; iv. xii. 2. The aldermen were still merged for\r\ngeneral business in the council, and appear only three times, possibly\r\nacting as a kind of separate estate—once in 1450 when some land was\r\nlet by the mayor, sheriffs, chamberlains, aldermen, and the whole\r\ncommunity; once twenty years later, when in 1471 a complaint was\r\naddressed to the King by the mayor, aldermen, and commonalty; and once\r\nin 1504 when an ordinance was made by the mayor and aldermen to reduce\r\ncertain fines to be paid by them for neglect of financial duties, to\r\nwhich they obtained the consent of councillors and commons. (Nott. Rec.\r\niii. 325; iii. 408; ii. 334.) In the first two cases the word may have\r\nbeen used to denote the whole council.\r\n\r\n[674] Ibid. iv. xii. xv.\r\n\r\n[675] Nott. Rec. iv. xi. xii. xiv. xv. We have only records of the\r\ncompleted changes in the middle of the sixteenth century, probably\r\nbecause of the loss of documents. But in the time of Henry VII. the\r\ndistinction was already established between the mayor and his brethren\r\nand the clothing (those who had served the office of chamberlain or\r\nsheriff). iii. 449.\r\n\r\n[676] Ibid. ii. 227.\r\n\r\n[677] See p. 350. In an agreement made in 1500 between the mayor,\r\ncouncil and clothing the names of six inhabitants are included,\r\napparently unofficial, and possibly representatives of the commons.\r\n(Nott. Rec. iii. 301.) The names set down for the election of the mayor\r\nand officers for the next year are the mayor, recorder, six aldermen,\r\nsix common councillors, two sheriffs, the six (apparently) plain\r\nburgesses mentioned in the last list, and twenty-four others of the\r\nclothing. (Compare the lists ibid. iii. 301, 302.)\r\n\r\n[678] For a list of the common property and common lands in 1435 see\r\nIbid. ii. 355-361; see also iii. 62-66; in 1351 iii. 366 _et sq._\r\n\r\n[679] The importance to the burgesses of the common lands may be\r\nillustrated by their argument in 1577 against admitting new burgesses\r\n“for there is too many of them already; by making of them the poor\r\nburgesses commons is eaten up, to the great hindrance of all.” At the\r\nsame time they insisted that if a burgess let out his part of the land\r\nit should be to a burgess and not to a foreigner. (Nott. Rec. iv. 171,\r\n172.)\r\n\r\n[680] Ibid. iv. 282. “We present the new council for not setting the\r\ntown’s grounds to the true meaning of their new election, but hath\r\ntaken the best ground to the richest men, and let the poor men have\r\nnothing that are ancienter burgesses. Also we find that the whole house\r\nor the most of them overhipt (passed over) themselves as it came to\r\nthem by order of their names in the book while they were disposing of\r\nHartliff ground and the coppices, but now that the East Steaner and\r\nother good closes come to be disposed of, they share them themselves,\r\nand leaves poor men unserved that are both ancient and needful.” This\r\nhappened in 1606 when the council had got control of the land.\r\n\r\n[681] Ibid. ii. 420. No doubt one of the grievances of the people\r\nunder a despotic administration was the being deprived of any adequate\r\ncontrol over the admission of new burgesses to share their lands.\r\nCompare Ibid. iii. 459 etc. with the constant remonstrance of the\r\nMickletorn jury.\r\n\r\n[682] The conflict of the sixteenth century lies really beyond our\r\nperiod in point of time, but the complaints of the people and the\r\nincidents of the fight throw much light on the working of municipal\r\ngovernment, even in earlier days.\r\n\r\n[683] 1500, Nott. Rec. iii. 74, 76. The chamberlain concerned in this\r\nbusiness was John Rose.\r\n\r\n[684] 1516, Nott. Rec. iii. 353.

The Mickletorn mentioned in 1308 was held in\r\nthe presence of the coroners and bailiffs, and presentments were made\r\nby decennaries of the daily market, (i. 66, 68.) Seventeen jurors are\r\nmentioned at the Mickletorn of 1395. (i. 268.) It is interesting to\r\ncompare the procedure at Coventry, as taken by Miss Dormer Harris from\r\nthe records. All petitions to be laid before the court were given in\r\nto the mayor four days before the meeting of the Leet; and these were\r\ninspected by twenty-four men summoned by the mayor. On the day of the\r\nLeet these petitions, if satisfactory, received the assent of the\r\ntwenty-four jurats of the Leet.\r\n\r\n[687] Nott. Rec. iii. 438.\r\n\r\n[688] Ibid. iii. 338-40.\r\n\r\n[689] As late as 1480 their right of assembly had been admitted, and at\r\nleast six of the commons had taken formal part in elections and other\r\nbusiness in 1500 and 1504.\r\n\r\n[690] This Mr. Treasurer was Sir Thomas Lovel, Treasurer of the\r\nHousehold, Constable of Nottingham Castle, Steward of Lenton monastery.\r\n\r\n[691] Nott. Rec. iii. 341-2.\r\n\r\n[692] Ibid. iii. 342-3.\r\n\r\n[693] In September, 1514, John Rose, mayor, and the burgesses of the\r\ntown gave a licence to John Sye to enclose part of the common ground\r\nfor his use at a rent of 2_s._ a year. (Nott. Rec. iii. 125.) But in\r\nFebruary, 1515, when leave was given to the guardians of the free\r\nschool to enclose land express mention is made of the mayor, burgesses,\r\nand community. (iii. 457.) The agreement in 1516 about the Lenton fair\r\nwas made between the convent and the mayor, sheriffs, burgesses, and\r\ncommonalty. (iii. 345.)

For a case in which this certainly\r\nhappened see p. 356. The same thing seems to have happened in 1504. A\r\nlaw of 1442 had ordered that if the mayor and bailiffs did not render\r\nup their accounts before leaving office they should be fined, £20\r\nfor the mayor, £10 for the bailiffs; in 1504 the mayor and aldermen\r\ntogether issued a new ordinance reducing the fine to one half, an\r\nordinance which was assented to by three common councillors, while for\r\nthe commonalty appear the names of seventeen burgesses, of whom one was\r\ncertainly one of the sheriffs. (Ibid. ii. 424; iii. 325.)\r\n\r\n[701] Nottingham Records, iv. pp. xiii. xxvii. xxviii. 100, 101, 1552.\r\n\r\n[702] Ibid. iv. 106-8, 215 _et sq._\r\n\r\n[703] Ibid. iii. 365; iv. 10.\r\n\r\n[704] Ibid. iv. 106, 191, 223. The free school was left to the\r\nguardianship of the mayor, aldermen, and common council, and if they\r\nwere negligent to the Lenton convent, now of course suppressed.

The burgesses seem to have twice at least\r\nacted with the people against or apart from the aldermen—once in the\r\nsettlement about the town accounts in 1504 (iii. 325-6); and once in\r\nthe complaint drawn up by the Mickletorn jury in 1527 against the mayor\r\nand aldermen (iii. 358-60.) The people may have hoped to strengthen\r\nthis element of resistance.\r\n\r\n[708] Mr. Stevenson thinks that the Clothing about this date became\r\na portion of the council.

They existed to make “presentments” which\r\ninvolved a certain amount of previous keeping of the peace in their\r\nown little neighbourhood. In their _individual_ capacity the capital\r\npledges were the precursors of the “petty constable” [see Selden Soc.\r\nv. lxii. no. 1, and cf. pages there cited]; in their _collective_\r\ncapacity as juries they preceded the local “Justice of the Peace,” a\r\nfunction usurped to a small extent between (say) 1360 and 1420 by the\r\n“twenty-four citizens,” and afterwards wholly usurped by the “Court of\r\nAldermen,” who were the borough magistrates.\r\n\r\n[723] Hudson, Leet Jur. in Norwich, lxxi., note.\r\n\r\n[724] Ibid. xv. 1365.

Saturday, Vigil of Palms, 27 Edward\r\nI. 1298—John the carpenter and Alice his wife grant a messuage next\r\nthe gates of Nedham to “Ballivi, Cives, et Communitas Norwici” “ad\r\nasiamentum muri civitatis erigendi.” (City Domesday, fol. lxxiii.) On\r\nfolio lxviii. of the same book there is a grant of a messuage near the\r\ncathedral to the commonalty, 31 Edward, 1302, in the following form:\r\n“to the four Bailiffs (named), Henry Clark, Robert de Holveston, ...\r\nAdam de Blicling, citizens of the said city (15 persons), and all the\r\nCommonalty thereof.”\r\n\r\n[727] Norwich Town Close Evidences, printed privately, 1885. (British\r\nMuseum), 18.\r\n\r\n[728] Arch. Journ. xlvi. no. 184, 322.\r\n\r\n[729] They state in 1378 that this had already been the custom. (Town\r\nClose Evidences, 30.)\r\n\r\n[730] Arch. Journ. xlvi. No 183, 315.\r\n\r\n[731] Town Close Evidences, 7. The phraze used in 1218 (p. 5), “men of\r\nthe city,” is not the same.\r\n\r\n[732] Ibid. 7, 13, 17, 18, 25, 26, 30. Arch. Journ. xlvi. no. 184, 325.\r\nSee Note A at end of chapter.\r\n\r\n[733] Town Close Evidences, 27.\r\n\r\n[734] Ibid. 16, 18.\r\n\r\n[735] Town Close Evidences, 10, 11, 17.\r\n\r\n[736] Norwich Town Close Evidences, 14, 24, 27, 31, 32. The same form\r\nwas used even after the charter of 1403, in 1420 and 1435. (Ibid. 46.)\r\nWe find “the citizens” joined with “the commonalty” in the thirteenth\r\ncentury. An enrolled deed of 1290, in which license to build a stall\r\nin the market is granted by the “Communitas Norwici et cives ejusdam\r\ncivitatis,” is quoted by Mr. Hudson. (See Mun. Org., Arch. Journ.\r\nxlvi. no. 184.) The double style used is, I think, explained by a\r\ncontention which occurred a century later, in 1379. “There was a\r\ndiscussion whether the stalls in the meat-market ought to belong to the\r\ncommonalty or to the bailiffs. They are agreed that the said stalls\r\nshall in future remain to the commonalty for ever, without challenge or\r\ncontradiction to the present bailiffs or the bailiffs in future.” (Town\r\nClose Evidences, 31.) At that time a great reorganization of the market\r\nwas in progress (see Kirkpatrick’s “Streets and Lanes of Norwich,” App.\r\ni. pp. 95, 96) with a view to getting as many stalls as possible into\r\nthe hands of the authorities. As the bailiffs had certain sources of\r\nincome allotted to them (they being personally responsible for the fee\r\nferm rent) they need not be blamed for trying to help themselves. On\r\nthe other hand the attempt shows how significant was the use of the\r\nword “communitas” in the older deed (see p. 364 no. 1). I think it very\r\npossible that property set apart for a definite public purpose was\r\nheld in the joint names of citizens and commonalty; but I am convinced\r\nthis last word was never used in a formal way, but always expressed a\r\ntenure and control with which the “cives” or the twenty-four could not\r\ninterfere.\r\n\r\n[737] Hudson, Leet Jur. in Norwich, xxxvi. lxxiii. 63. Selden Soc.\r\n\r\n[738] Arch. Journ. xlvi. 316-17.\r\n\r\n[739] Town Close Evidences, 16-17.\r\n\r\n[740] Ibid. 29. Evidently this was a time of very active municipal\r\nlife. About 1372 the corporation seems to have begun copying out\r\ncarefully older legal documents, and this copying and re-writing went\r\non through the next century. The account-books which still exist began\r\nto be kept in 1393. In 1378 the income of the city was £374 17 _s._\r\n4_d._ Blomefield, iii. 103.\r\n\r\n[741] Town Close Evidences, 30.\r\n\r\n[742] Mr. Hudson informs me that there are rolls (more or less perfect)\r\nfor about half the years between 1365 and 1385. Then they fail till\r\n1413, when the constitution of the assembly had been entirely altered.\r\n\r\n[743] I have to thank Mr. Hudson for his kindness in giving me this\r\ninformation. He tells me that an assembly on October 7th, 1372, is\r\nthus described: “Prima congregatio ibidem tenta die Jovis, &c. ...\r\nquatuor Ballivis (eleven persons specially named) et aliis de com’tate\r\npresentibus.” This is the constant form in use, whenever the attendance\r\nis recorded, down to the last of these rolls in 1385. The number\r\nof persons specially named varies from eleven to seventeen. Their\r\nsimilarity in the course of each year suggests that they were specially\r\nbound to attend. In two years 1377-8 and 1379-80 the attendances are\r\nrecorded several times, and, as in the first case the total number of\r\npersons named is twenty-five and in the other twenty-four, it seems\r\nreasonably certain that they were the actual twenty-four. This is\r\nconfirmed by the fact that almost all the “committee,” as they would\r\nnow be called, are appointed from their number and almost the whole\r\nburden of administration is undertaken by one or other of them in\r\nconjunction with the bailiffs.\r\n\r\n[744] Citizens left legacies to help in these expenses. Not only was\r\n£1,000 lent to the King, but heavy bribes had to be paid all round.\r\nBlomefield, iii. 120.\r\n\r\n[745] Town Close Evidences, 36. In considering the new style two views\r\npresent themselves. We may lay the whole stress on the association\r\nof mayor and sheriffs instead of bailiffs with “the citizens and\r\ncommonalty”; or, as I incline to think, we may also attach importance\r\nto the formal association in a charter of “citizens” and “commonalty,”\r\nas marking an epoch in the civic history.\r\n\r\n[746] Mr. Hudson has been good enough to give me these dates and facts,\r\nin which he has been able to correct Blomefield’s statements, from\r\nevidence in the Norwich Conveyance Rolls, etc.\r\n\r\n[747] Blomefield, iii. 123-124.

(Stow’s London, 189.) A common council\r\nappears as early as 1273; and again in 1347. It was then chosen by the\r\nmayor, aldermen, and representatives from the wards. At the end of\r\nEdward’s reign the election was transferred to the trading companies,\r\nbut restored to the wards in 1384; to be given back to the companies\r\nby Edward the Fourth in 1467; and restored to the wards in 1650.\r\n(Merewether and Stephens, 734-5, 1988-1992.)\r\n\r\n[750] All that had been mayors were to ride in their cloaks whenever\r\nthe mayor rode on pain of £20, each of the twenty-four on pain of\r\n100_s._ The hat of the mayor cost in 1418 2_s._ 10_d._, in 1437 10_s._\r\n2_d._ (Rogers’ Agric. and Prices, iv. 579.)\r\n\r\n[751] Town Close Evidences, 40-1.\r\n\r\n[752] Conesford elected twelve councillors, Mancroft sixteen, Wymer\r\ntwenty, and the Ward over the Water twelve.\r\n\r\n[753] The Speaker of the House of Commons is first mentioned in 1378.\r\n\r\n[754] Town Close Evidences, 39, 40, 41.\r\n\r\n[755] Town Close Evidences, 41, 42.\r\n\r\n[756] Ibid. 45.\r\n\r\n[757] Blomefield, iii. 134.\r\n\r\n[758] Town Close Evidences, 41.\r\n\r\n[759] Ibid. 45.\r\n\r\n[760] In 1423 when the mayor and other judges sat in the city there\r\nappeared before them two coroners, 16 constables for the four wards,\r\nthe constables for the liberties of Holmestrete and Spitelond, with the\r\nbailiff of the prior’s liberties in those places, and four men out of\r\neach ward possibly for jurymen. In 1424 a tripartite indenture was made\r\nby the mayor, aldermen, and commons, with constitutions for the better\r\ngovernment of the city, and was ratified at a common assembly in the\r\nguild hall.

Before\r\nthe end of the thirteenth century there were guilds of cobblers,\r\nfullers, saddlers, tanners. (Ibid. 13, 39, 42, 43.)\r\n\r\n[764] In the list given in English Guilds there is one guild founded\r\nin 1307 and ten (or eleven, if we count the masons’ guild on p. 39)\r\nfounded between 1350 and 1385, some of them craft guilds, others\r\nnominally social or religious associations, though it is very probable\r\nthat in many cases this was but a thin disguise for a craft guild.\r\nEnglish Guilds, 14, etc.\r\n\r\n[765] See saddlers’ guild, which had existed a century before.\r\n\r\n[766] The composition of 1415 decided that each craft in the city was\r\nyearly to choose two masters, whose names were to be presented for\r\nthe mayor’s consent, and who were to take their oaths before him. The\r\nMonday after the mayor’s “riding” these masters were to make good and\r\ntrue search in their crafts and to present all offenders before the\r\nmayor for judgement; and half the fines were given to the sheriffs,\r\nhalf to the masters of the crafts. The mayor had to accept the\r\npresentment of the “masters”; he could not make search either himself\r\nor by any of the town officers; only if a craft refused to be searched\r\nor to elect masters the mayor might himself appoint two masters and\r\norder the search. If the masters concealed any notable default they\r\nwere to be punished by the advice of the mayor and more sufficient men\r\nof the same craft. (Town Close Evidences, 41, 42.)\r\n\r\n[767] On being enrolled each man must pay to the craft 40 pence, and to\r\nthe chamber at least 20_s._ and “more after the quantity of his good.”\r\n(Town Close Evidences, 42.) The profits of admission to the freedom of\r\nthe city had in old times gone half to the bailiffs and half to the\r\ncommunity, but now the craft claimed a definite share of the entrance\r\nmoney. (Arch. Journ. xlvi. no. 184, p. 328.) By the composition six men\r\nwere to be chosen “to be of counsel with the chamberlains in receiving\r\nof burgesses.”\r\n\r\n[768] Town Close Evidences, 42-3.\r\n\r\n[769] Hist. MSS.

By the law\r\nof 1442 the weavers were to choose every year four wardens from the\r\ncraftsmen of the town, who should in their turn choose two inspectors\r\nor overseers for the stuff out of Norfolk. The wardens tested the\r\nfaulty goods and received half of any forfeited stuffs. The law of 1445\r\nordered them to choose four wardens for Norwich and four for Norfolk,\r\nand directed the wardens to make such laws as were needful for the\r\nimprovement of the trade. (20 Henry VI. cap. 10; 23 Henry VI. cap. 3; 7\r\nEdward IV. cap. 1.)\r\n\r\n[773] See Paston Letters.\r\n\r\n[774] Not only were there disputes with the prior of Norwich, but with\r\nthe Hospital of S.

The courts were held in\r\nthe tolbooth, but the assemblies of the commons still gathered in\r\nthe chapel of the Virgin Mary in the Fields. (Ibid. 92.) Most of the\r\ncity business was done there as late as 1455. (Ibid. 160.) It appears\r\nthat the citizens frequently availed themselves of other people’s\r\naccommodation (the Priory, Black Friars, Grey Friars) rather than spend\r\nmoney in providing it for themselves.\r\n\r\n[779] Ibid. iii. 153.\r\n\r\n[780] William Paston was one of the commissioners.

In 1477 a statute was made that\r\nthe Pye-powder Court could only deal with contracts or bargains made\r\nduring the fair. (Blomefield, iii. 169.)\r\n\r\n[790] Ibid. iii. 149-50, 154-5.\r\n\r\n[791] Ibid. 147, 152.\r\n\r\n[792] He left £40 to Norwich towards payment of the city tax.\r\n(Blomefield, iii. 534.) The city, however, asked in vain for the money\r\nin 1454 and again in 1460. (159.) Walter Lyhert, made bishop in 1446,\r\nwas of an old Norwich family.

(Paston Letters, i.\r\ncxlii.)\r\n\r\n[798] In 1456 the common stock was so much wasted that several of the\r\naldermen remitted debts to the city. (Blomefield, iii. 160.) And even\r\nthe guild of S. George was scarcely able to pay its way. (Hist. MSS.\r\nCom. i. 104.)\r\n\r\n[799] All ex-mayors were allowed to be justices of the peace. Four of\r\nthe justices of the peace were to have the powers of King’s justices,\r\nand the aldermen were allowed to elect the under sheriffs, town clerks,\r\nand sheriffs’ bailiffs. (Blomefield, iii. 158.)\r\n\r\n[800] Hist. MSS. Com. i. 104. In 1452 it was ordered that no brother\r\nshould wear a red gown save the alderman of the guild or any of the\r\ntwenty-four aldermen of the city.\r\n\r\n[801] The first attempt at a settlement was in 1205 about the rights of\r\ncommon of the townspeople. (Town Close Evidences, 4-5.)\r\n\r\n[802] Town Close Evidences, 52-64.\r\n\r\n[803] Vol. I. p. 221.\r\n\r\n[804] Dr. Gross, taking the Trinity guild of Lynn as “a continuation of\r\nthe old guild merchant,” speaks of its “line of developement” into a\r\n“simple, social-religious fraternity” (i. 161); and notes that “though\r\nthe ancient function of the guild had disappeared, its social-religious\r\nsuccessor was a quasi-official part of the civic polity” (p. 162). He\r\ndoes not, however, enable us to trace any such “developement,” or to\r\ndistinguish “ancient functions” from later ones. From our first glimpse\r\nof the guild in the charters of John and Henry the Third to the patent\r\nof Henry the Fifth it seems to be singularly free from change, nor is\r\nany evidence produced during these centuries for its “transformation\r\ninto a simple social-religious guild.” In the case of Southampton Dr.\r\nGross sees a developement of an exactly opposite kind (ii. 231).\r\n\r\n[805] For a most interesting account of the Lynn cattle and sheep\r\ntrade, and the Kipton Ash market, set up in 1306, for drafting off the\r\nsheep flocks, see Dr. Jessopp’s paper in the Nineteenth Century, June,\r\n1892, on “A Fourteenth Century Parson.”\r\n\r\n[806] Cunningham, Growth of English Industry and Commerce, 183.\r\n\r\n[807] The guild did not include all the town traders (Gross, ii.\r\n166-7), and probably tended to become an exclusive body since it could\r\nkeep out all save the sons of its members by charging whatever entrance\r\nfees it liked (p. 164).\r\n\r\n[808] Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, p. 210-11.\r\n\r\n[809] Blomefield, viii. 515. Gross, ii. 159-170. The guild of Corpus\r\nChristi paid in 1400 103_s._ 2_d._ for meat and drinks and spices for\r\nits feast, and 169_s._ for making wax torches; and the beginning of the\r\ncentury was marked by the foundation of at least three other guilds,\r\nwith right to hold land and buildings.\r\n\r\n[810] Gross, ii. 166-7.\r\n\r\n[811] Gross, ii. 166.\r\n\r\n[812] A charter of 1305 secured its possession of certain property.\r\nThe charter of 1393 was probably connected with the extension of the\r\nstatute of mortmain to towns. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 186, 191.)\r\n\r\n[813] Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, p. 211. Gross, ii. 153. The best\r\nmill-stones in those days came from Paris, or from Andernach on the\r\nRhine. A good mill-stone might cost from £3 to £4. (Rogers’ Work and\r\nWages, i. 113.)\r\n\r\n[814] Even from the thirteenth century. (Gross, ii. 153.)\r\n\r\n[815] Gross, ii. 159.\r\n\r\n[816] Hist. MSS.

(Our Borough, 17.)\r\n\r\n[833] Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 197, 200.\r\n\r\n[834] Either officer convicted of false dealing was to lose his office\r\nand franchise for ever.\r\n\r\n[835] The four chamberlains or treasurers were then to be chosen\r\nfrom the body of burgesses, two by the mayor and jurats, two by the\r\nburgesses. But, unlike Norwich, where the council and commons divided\r\nthe remaining elections between them, in Lynn the only appointment\r\nleft to the community besides the two chamberlains was the prolocutor.\r\nCoroners and constables were nominated by the people, and elected\r\nby the jurats, and the other officers, the common clerk, serjeant,\r\njanitors, bell-man and wait, taken from the general community both of\r\nburgesses and non-burgesses, were directly appointed by the mayor and\r\njurats.\r\n\r\n[836] Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 196-202. There were “constabularies” which\r\ncorresponded to wards, over which a captain was appointed in time of\r\nwar or danger. (Hist. MSS.

Com. xi. 3, 195, 203.\r\n\r\n[842] Instances of the important place held by the alderman in matters\r\nof town government in 1420. (Ibid. 246, and in 1431-42, p. 162-4.)\r\n\r\n[843] In 1426 the alderman of the guild chose four fit persons who\r\ntook the accustomed oath and entered the chamber; they chose four\r\nothers, who, after being sworn, were brought into the chamber, and the\r\neight then added to their number four more. The whole body of twelve,\r\nafter sitting from the tenth to the third hour, were finally divided\r\nas to the election of the serjeant who had in some way offended the\r\ncommunity, and at whose name a “great murmur now arose amongst the\r\npeople” waiting outside. He was, however, chosen after asking pardon of\r\nthe mayor and community for his offence. (Ibid. 160.) In 1477 another\r\nelection is described, which was carried on in exactly the same way.\r\n(Ibid. 169.) And in 1470, when a constable had to be elected there was\r\nthe same procedure.\r\n\r\n[844] Beloe, 21.\r\n\r\n[845] Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3, 245, 246.\r\n\r\n[846] The gradual change in the mode of electing burgesses for\r\nparliament illustrates the action of the councils in absorbing\r\ninfluence. In 1314 the jury to elect the burgesses had been chosen by\r\na committee of twenty-six townsmen. But at least from 1425 the mayor\r\nassumed the right of choosing the first four of the jury, who then\r\nnamed the remaining eight. In 1433, if not earlier, the mayor was bound\r\nto select two of the twenty-four and two of the twenty-seven, and the\r\nadded eight members were all taken from the same bodies; and in 1442\r\nthis custom was made into a permanent law. (Hist. MSS. Com. xi. 3.\r\n240, 157-8, 163-4, 166-9.) About 1523 the burgesses were chosen by\r\nthe twenty-four and twenty-seven voting personally in assembly; this\r\nassembly, called the “House,” carried on all dealings with members,\r\ninstructed them, paid them, and received their reports. The first\r\neffort of the burgesses at large to take any part in election was at\r\nthe Long Parliament. (Ibid. pp. 148-9.)\r\n\r\n[847] 1427, Ibid. 160; 1428, p. 161; 1441, p. 163-4; 1442, p. 164;\r\n1466, p. 168. Cf. also p. 148.\r\n\r\n[848] Hist. MSS.

The use of the word communitas in 1463 is here\r\nexplained as showing how the term had “already lost its original\r\nmeaning and was used to designate the humblest and least influential\r\nclass of the burgesses.” But community was used in exactly this sense\r\nin 1305. (Ibid. 187.)\r\n\r\n[855] For some details of the seventy-five guilds of Lynn see the\r\nNorfolk Antiquarian Miscellany, edited by Walter Rye, Part I., pp.\r\n153-183.\r\n\r\n[856] Lyon’s Dover, I. xi.; ii. 267-8, 287, 312, 370.\r\n\r\n[857] In Dover the common assembly summoned in the same way was called\r\na Hornblowing.
