December 12, 1765)\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little is known about the author of \"The Politician Out-witted,\"[1] a\r\nplay which I have selected as representative of the efforts of the American\r\ndrama, as early as 1789, to reflect the political spirit of the time.\r\nAssiduous search on the part of the present editor has failed to bring to\r\nlight any information from any of the historical societies regarding Mr.\r\nLow, except that he was born on December 12, 1765, and that he must have\r\nbeen, in his political sympathies, an anti-federalist. The reader who is\r\ninterested in literary comparisons might take this play of Low's and read\r\nit in connection with Dunlap's \"The Father,\" in which a prologue gives a\r\nvery excellent example of the American spirit. Dunlap's \"Darby's Return\"\r\nmight likewise be read in connection with \"The Politician Out-witted,\"\r\ninasmuch as it refers to the Federal Constitution, and to Washington's\r\ninauguration.\r\n\r\nThe present play, which was opposed to the Federal union, was, according to\r\nsome authorities, offered to the actors, Hallam and Henry, and was promptly\r\nrejected by them. There is no record of the piece having thereafter\r\nsucceeded in reaching the theatre. It is mentioned both in Dunlap and in\r\nSeilhamer in a casual manner.\r\n\r\nIn the New York Directory, of 1794, we find Samuel Low mentioned as a clerk\r\nin the Treasury Department, and, in a later Directory of 1797-1798, he is\r\nreferred to as the first bookkeeper in the Bank of New York.[2]\r\n\r\nIn the preface to his published poems, after the diffident manner of the\r\ntime, Low says: \"Many of the pieces were written at a very early age, and\r\nmost of them under singular disadvantages; among which, application to\r\npublic business, for many years past, was not the least; not only because\r\nit allowed little leisure for literary pursuits, but because it is of a\r\nnature peculiarly inimical to the cultivation of poetic talent. For his own\r\namusement and improvement he has written--at the request of his friends he\r\npublishes.\"\r\n\r\nWe know that he was a writer of odes, exhibiting some grace in his handling\r\nof this poetic form. He is also credited with having written a long poem\r\nentitled \"Winter Displayed,\" in 1794. In 1800, two volumes of poems\r\nappeared in New York, and among the subscribers listed were John Jacob\r\nAstor, William Dunlap, Philip Hone, Dr. Peter Irving, and members of the\r\nBeekman and Schermerhorn families.[3] Examining the contents of these\r\nvolumes, one discovers that Samuel Low, in a social and fraternal way, must\r\nhave been a very active member of New York society. On January 8, 1800, his\r\n\"Ode on the Death of Washington\" was recited by Hodgkinson at the New York\r\nTheatre.\r\n\r\nAt St. Paul's Church, and at Trinity Church, his anthems and odes were ever\r\nto the fore. He must have been a member of the Tammany Society, or\r\nColumbian Order, because a \"Hymn to Liberty\" was penned by him, and sung in\r\nchurch on the anniversary of that organization, May 12, 1790.\r\n\r\nHis Masonic interests are indicated throughout the volume by poems written\r\nespecially for such orders as the Holland Lodge, and the Washington Chapter\r\nof Royal Arch Masons. He was also asked to write an epitaph on John\r\nFrederick Roorbach.\r\n\r\nHis interest in politics may likewise be seen in several poems written\r\nabout the Constitution of the United States; while his literary taste may\r\nbe measured by his tribute to Kotzebue, the \"second Shakespeare,\" in which\r\noccur the lines:\r\n\r\n    \"_The purest, sweetest among modern bards\r\n    Who tread the difficult dramatic path._\"\r\n\r\n\r\nExcept for this, as one of the biographical sources says, nothing is known\r\nof Low's history, \"and he is only saved from absolute oblivion by his two\r\nsmall volumes of poems.\"\r\n\r\nYet \"The Politician Out-witted\" has historical value, and, in its dialogue,\r\nexhibits how well Low had studied the artificial comedy of Sheridan. The\r\nconstruction of the plot is mechanical, but the convictions of the two\r\nopposing fathers, on the subject of the Constitution, give the play an\r\ninterest in character and in viewpoint which is marked. It is not a piece\r\nadapted to the theatre, there being slight action of a cumulative kind;\r\nbut, as an example of early closet drama, it cannot be ignored.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The/Politician Out-witted,/a/Comedy,/In Five Acts./Written in the\r\nYear 1788./By an American./\"Then let not Censure, with malignant\r\njoy,/\"The harvest of his humble hope destroy!\"/Falconer's Shipwreck.\r\n[Colophon.]/New-York:/Printed for the Author, by W.

LXXXIX./\r\n\r\n[2] Through the assiduous researches of a member of the staff of the\r\nAmericana Division of the New York Public Library, who has generously\r\ngiven me permission to use the results of this investigation, there is\r\nbrought to light, in the New York Directory for 1803, the name of Widow\r\nAnn Low, keeper of a boarding-house. There is a plausible theory framed\r\nby this investigator that, maybe, Samuel Low died during the New York\r\nyellow fever epidemic of 1803, although his name does not occur in the\r\nNew York _Evening Post_ death lists for that year. It may be that our\r\nSamuel, as revealed in the annals of the Dutch Reform Church, v. 1, p.\r\n273; v. 32, p. 23 (New York Geneological and Biographical Society),\r\nmarried Anne Creiger, as recorded on April 20, 1797, and that she may be\r\nthe \"Widow Ann\" referred to above. The Nicholas Low mentioned in the\r\nDirectories of the time as President of the Bank of New York, and who\r\nwas well-to-do, must have been the brother, or some near relation. There\r\nare many Samuel Lows of this period; one (1739-1807) mentioned in the D.\r\nA. R. Lineage, v. 15; another who married Margaret Kip. The nearest we\r\nget to our Low's parentage is a reference, in the Reports of the New\r\nYork Geneological and Biographical Society, v. 29, p. 36, to John and\r\nSusanna Low, whose son, Samuel, was, born December 22, 1765.\r\nIdentification has yet to be established.\r\n\r\n[3] Poems, By Samuel Low.

Ugh, ugh,\r\nugh.\r\n\r\n_Enter THOMAS._\r\n\r\nWell, Thomas, what's the news?                             [_Eagerly._\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. Nothing strange, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. That's more than I can say, Thomas, for I'm sure 'tis strange to\r\nhear so many people praise this same new Constitution, as it is\r\ncall'd.--Has the _New-York Journal_ been brought to-day?\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n                                             [_Fetches the newspaper._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Look if it contains anything worth reading, Thomas; anything in\r\nbehalf of the good old cause.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. Yes, sir, here's something will suit your honour's notion to a\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n                                              [_Offers it to LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. No, Thomas, do you read it,--I'm afraid I shall cast my eyes upon\r\nsomething that's on the other side of the question; some wicked\r\nconsolidation scheme or another.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. Why, you know, sir, there's never anything in this paper but what's\r\non your side of the question.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. True, true; by my body, you're right enough, Tom.--I forgot that:\r\nbut never mind; since you've got the paper, do you read it.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. He only wants me to read, because he can't see to do it\r\nhimself,--he's almost as blind as a bat, and yet he won't use spectacles\r\nfor fear of being thought old.                               [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Come, Thomas, let's have it,--I'm all ears to hear you.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. 'Tis a pity you have not a little more eyesight and brains along\r\nwith your ears. [_Aside._] [_Reads._] \"Extract of a letter from a gentleman\r\nin Boston, dated February the third, 1788.--Our convention will pass the\r\nfederal government by a considerable majority: The more it is examined, the\r\nmore converts are made for its adoption. This you may rely on.\"\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. 'Tis a cursed lie.--Why, why, you confounded scoundrel, do you\r\nmean to ridicule your master?\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. I ask pardon, sir; I thought it was the _New-York Journal_; but I\r\nsee it is Mr. Child's _Daily Advertiser_.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. A plague on his aristocratic intelligence!--Begone, you vile foe\r\nto American Liberty, or I'll--\r\n\r\n                                                       [_Exit THOMAS._\r\n\r\n_Enter TRUEMAN._\r\n\r\nWhat, my friend Trueman! well, what's the news, eigh?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I have not learn'd a single monosyllable, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Nothing concerning this same Constitution there is so much talk\r\nabout, friend Horace? A miserable Constitution, by the bye. If mine was no\r\nbetter,--ugh, ugh, ugh,--I say, if--ugh, ugh, if my constitution was no\r\nbetter than this same political one, I solemnly swear, as true as I am this\r\nday, man and boy, two score and three years, five months, eleven days, six\r\nhours, and, and,--[_Pulling out his watch._] fifty-nine minutes old; why,\r\nI--I--I would,--I don't know what I wou'd not do. Ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Mr. Loveyet, you run on in such a surprising manner with your\r\nnarrations, imprecations, admirations, and interrogations, that, upon my\r\neducation, sir, I believe you are approaching to insanity, frenzy, lunacy,\r\nmadness, distraction,--a man of your age--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Age, sir, age!--And what then, sir, eigh! what then? I'd have you\r\nto know, sir, that I shall not have lived forty years till next spring\r\ntwelvemonth, old as I am; and if my countenance seems to belie me a little\r\nor so, why--trouble, concern for the good of my country, sir, and this\r\ntyrannical, villainous Constitution have made me look so; but my health is\r\nsound, sir; my lungs are good, sir, [_Raising his voice._]--ugh, ugh,\r\nugh,--I am neither spindle-shank'd nor crook-back'd, and I can kiss a\r\npretty girl with as good a relish as--ugh, ugh,--ha, ha, ha. A man of five\r\nand forty, old, forsooth! ha, ha. My age, truly!--ugh, ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You talk very valiantly, Mr. Loveyet; very valiantly indeed; I\r\ndare say now you have temerity and enterprise enough, even at this time of\r\nday, to take a _wife_.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. To be sure I have. Let me see,--I shou'd like a woman an inch or\r\ntwo less than six feet high now, and thick in proportion: By my body, such\r\na woman wou'd look noble by the side of me when she was entient.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Oh, monstrous! Entient! an entient woman by the side of an antient\r\nhusband! Most preposterous, unnatural, and altogether incongruous!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Poh, a fig for your high-flown nonsense. I suppose you think it\r\nwould cost me a great deal of trouble.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. No, no; some clever young blade will save you the trouble.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By my body, I should love dearly to have such a partner; she would\r\nbe a credit to me when she had me under the arm.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Under the _thumb_, you mean.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Under the _Devil_, _you_ mean.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You're right; you might as well be under the Devil's government as\r\npetticoat government; you're perfectly right there.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'm not perfectly right;--I--I--I mean _you_ are not perfectly\r\nright; and as for her age, why I should like her to be--let me see--about\r\nten years younger than myself: a man shou'd be at least ten years older\r\nthan his wife.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Ten years; fifty-three and ten are sixty-three. Then you mean your\r\nwife shall be fifty-three years of age.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. S'death, sir! I tell you I am but two and forty years old: She\r\nsha'n't be more than thirty odd, sir, and she shall be ten years younger\r\nthan I am too.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Yes, thirty odd years younger than _you_ are; ha, ha. The exiguity\r\nof those legs is a most promising earnest of your future exploits, and\r\ndemonstrate your agility, virility, salubrity, and amorosity; ha, ha, ha. I\r\ncan't help laughing to think what a blessed union there will be between\r\nAugust and December; a jolly, buxom, wanton, wishful, plethoric female of\r\nthirty odd, to an infirm, decrepit, consumptive, gouty, rheumatic,\r\nasthmatic, phlegmatic mortal of near seventy; ha, ha. Exquisitely droll\r\nand humourous, upon my erudition. It puts me in mind of a hot bed in a hard\r\nwinter, surrounded with ice, and made verdant and flourishing only by\r\nartificial means.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Pshaw, you're a fool!\r\n\r\n_Enter TOUPEE._\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Pardonnez moy, monsieur. I hope it not be any intrusion; par dieu,\r\nI will not frize dat Jantemon à la mode Paris no more, becase he vas fronte\r\nme.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. What's the matter, Mr. Toupee?\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. I vill tella your honare of the fracas. I vas vait on monsieur\r\na--choses, and make ma compliment avec beaucoup de grace, ven monsieur vas\r\nread de news papier; so I say, is your honare ready for be dress? De great\r\nman say, \"No--, d--n de barbare.\" [_In a low voice._] I tell de parsone,\r\nsare, I have promise 'pon honare for dress one great man vat is belong to\r\nde Congress, 'bout dis time, sans manquer: De ansare vas (excuse moy,\r\nmonsieur), \"go to h-ll, if you be please; I must read 'bout de\r\nConstitution.\" Dis is de ole affair, monsieur, en verité.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Sixty-three, indeed! Heaven forbid! But if I was so old, my\r\nconstitution is good; age is nothing, the constitution is all,--ugh, ugh,\r\nugh.\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Sare, you vill give me leaf, vat is dat Constitution?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Hold your prating, you booby.\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. You booby,--Vat is dat booby, I vonder!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Ha, ha, a good constitution! With great propriety did the man ask\r\nyou what constitution you meant. Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Par Dieu, monsieur de Schoolmastare sall larn a me vat is de booby!\r\noui, an de Constitution,--foy d'Homme d'Honneur.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. What a figure for a sound constitution! ha, ha.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Ugh, hang you for an old simpleton! Talk of _my_ age and\r\nconstitution.--Ugh, ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Fractious old blockhead!\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Blockhead! Pourquoi you call a mine head von block, sare?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I mean that old curmudgeon who goes hobbling along there, like a\r\nman of forty.\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Pardonnez moy, monsieur; S'il vous plaît, ve make de\r\néclaircissement, if you tell me vat is de interpretation--you booby.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. What! have you the effrontery to call me a booby? S'death, you\r\nscoundrel, what do you mean?\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Vous ne m'entendez pas.                            [_Hastily._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Do you threaten me, you insignificant thing? Do you call me names?\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Diable! me no stand under your names.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Zounds and fury! I am raving. Must I bear to be abus'd in this\r\nmanner, by a vile Tonsor?\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Yes, you Schoolmastare; you tell me vat be you booby.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Pertinacious, audacious reptile!             [_Canes TOUPEE._\r\n\r\nTOUPEE. Ah, mon dieu! mon dieu!                           [_Runs off._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. To insult a professor of Orthography, Analogy, Syntax, and\r\nProsody!\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II. _A Street._\r\n\r\n_Enter YOUNG LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nIn compliance with the commands of a father, here I am, once more in the\r\nplace of my nativity. Duty to him, and curiosity to know, why he has\r\nenjoined my sudden departure so peremptorily, as well as a desire to see\r\nNew-York (perhaps never to leave it more) have all conspir'd to bring me\r\nhere sooner than I am expected,--let me see--yes, I must try to find out\r\nFrankton first. [_HUMPHRY crosses the stage._] Here, friend, honest man,\r\nprithee stop.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. What's your will?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Can you inform me, friend, where one Mr. Frankton lives?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No, I don't know where anybody lives in this big city, not I; for\r\nmy part, I believe how they all lives in the street, there's such a\r\nmonstrous sight of people a scrouging backards and forards, as the old\r\nsaying is. If I was home now--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Where is your home, if I may make so free?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Oh, you may make free and welcome, for the more freer the more\r\nwelcomer, as the old saying is; I never thinks myself too good to discourse\r\nmy superiors: There's some of our townsfolks now, why some of 'um isn't so\r\ngood as I, to be sure. There's Tom Forge, the blacksmith, and little Daniel\r\nSnip, the tailor, and Roger Peg, the cobbler, and Tim Frize, the barber,\r\nand Landlord Tipple, that keeps the ale-house at the sign of the Turk's\r\nHead, and Jeremy Stave, the clerk of the meeting-house, why, there an't one\r\nof 'um that's a single copper before a beggar, as the old saying is; but\r\nwhat o' that? We isn't all born alike, as father says; for my part, I likes\r\nto be friendly, so give us your hand. You mus'n't think how I casts any\r\nreflections on you; no, no, I scorn the action. [_They shake hands._]\r\nThat's hearty now--Friendship is a fine thing, and, a friend indeed is a\r\nfriend in need, as the saying is.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What an insufferable fool it is!               [_Half aside._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, it is insufferable cool, that's sartin; but it's time to\r\nexpect it.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Worse and worse!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, I warrant you it will be worser and worser before long; so I\r\nmust e'en go home soon, and look after the corn and the wheat, or else old\r\nfather will bring his pigs to a fine market, as the old proverb goes.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. You're quite right; you mean your father wou'd bring his corn to a\r\nfine market: You mean it as a figurative expression, I presume.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Not I, I isn't for none of your figure expressions, d' ye see,\r\nbecase why, I never larnt to cipher;--every grain of corn a pig! Ha, ha,\r\nha. That's pleasant, ecod; why the Jews wou'dn't dare for to shew their\r\nnoses out o'doors, everything wou'd smell so woundily of pork! Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. A comical countryman of mine this. [_Aside._] What is your name,\r\nmy honest lad?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, if you'll tell me your name, I'll tell you mine, d' ye see;\r\nfor, one good turn desarves another, as the old saying is, and, evil be to\r\nthem that evil thinks, every tub must stand upon its own bottom, and, when\r\nthe steed is stolen, shut the stable door, and, while the grass grows, the\r\nmare starves--the horse I mean; it don't make no odds, a horse is a mare,\r\nbut a mare an't a horse, as father says, d' ye see--and----\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What a monstrous combination of nonsense!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Don't tell me what I am, but tell me what I have been--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Prithee, Mr. Sancho, let's have no more of those insipid proverbs.\r\nYou was going to tell me your name.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. My name is Cubb,--Humphry Cubb, at your sarvice, as the saying is.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Hah! my worthy friend Frankton----\r\n\r\n_Enter FRANKTON._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. My best, my long expected Charles! your arrival has made me the\r\nhappiest man alive.\r\n\r\n                                                      [_They embrace._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I am heartily glad to see you, George, and to meet you so\r\nopportunely; 'tis not fifteen minutes since I landed on my native soil, and\r\nyou are the very person, above every other in the city, whom I wish'd first\r\nto see.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Then you have not forgot your friend.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Far from it, Frankton; be assured that the joy I now feel at\r\nmeeting with _you_, is by no means the least I expect to experience.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Our satisfaction is then mutual--your friends are all happy and\r\nwell, and I know your arrival will not a little contribute to _their_\r\nfelicity, as well as mine--but who have you here, Loveyet? Landed not\r\nfifteen minutes ago, and in close confab with one of our Boors already?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. A boar! why you're worser than he there--he only took father's\r\n_corn_ for _pigs_, but do you take _me_ for a _boar_, eigh? Do I look like\r\na _hog_, as the saying is?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Begone, you illiterate lubber!--My dear Charles, I have a\r\nthousand things to say to you, and this is an unfit place for conversation.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. We will adjourn to the Coffee-House.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. No, you shall go with me to my lodgings.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, what a cruel-minded young dog he is! See how he swaggers and\r\nstruts--he looks very like the Pharisee's head, on old _Coming Sir_, honest\r\nDick Tipple's sign, I think--No, now I look at him good, he's the very\r\nmoral of our Tory.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I wait your pleasure, Frankton.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Then allons!\r\n\r\n                                       [_Exeunt FRANKTON and LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. [_Burlesquing them._] Forward, march--as our Captain\r\nsays--[_Struts after them._]--Literary lubber, eigh! But I'll be up with\r\nthe foutre.\r\n\r\n_FRANKTON and LOVEYET return._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Do you call me a foutre, you rascal?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Call you a future! ha, ha, ha. I was a talking about something\r\nthat I was a going for to do some other time, sir.--Doesn't future magnify\r\nsome other time, eigh?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. The future signifies the time to come, to be sure.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Well, then, isn't I right? What argufies your signifies, or your\r\nmagnifies? There an't the toss up of a copper between 'um--I wou'dn't give\r\na leather button for the choice, as the old proverb goes.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Harkee, Mr. Talkative, if you ever----\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No, sir, never,--that I won't--no, no, you may be sure of that.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Sure of what?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Nothing, sir; we can be sartin of nothing in this world, as Mr.\r\nThumpum says.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Oh, what a precious numskull it is!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_To FRANKTON._] I have a letter here, which announces to my\r\nfather, my intention to leave the West-Indies the beginning of March, but I\r\nmiss'd of the expected conveyance--I have half a mind to send it yet. I\r\nwould not have him apprized of my arrival; for I wish to try if he would\r\nknow me;--and yet I long to embrace my aged and venerable parent.--Will you\r\ndo me the favour to take this letter to my father, Mr. Cubb? He lives at\r\nnumber two hundred and fifty, in Queen-Street, in a three-story red brick\r\nhouse.--I'll reward you for it.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. As for your rewards, I'm above it, d' ye see: If I do it, I'll do\r\nit without fear or reward, as the saying is; but if you think fit, you may\r\ntreat a body to the valuation of a mug or so. Don't you love ale? for they\r\nsays how the Yorkers is cursed fellows for strong beer.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What a digression!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I scorn your words--'tis no transgression at all to drink\r\nale--Why, Parson Thumpum himself drinks ale.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Well, will you carry the letter? You shall have as much strong\r\nbeer when you come back as you can stagger under.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, if I was for to have my beer a-board before I go, I shou'dn't\r\nget top-heavy, as the saying is; for I can carry as much weight in my head\r\nas e'er a he that wears a head, without staggering.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I dare say you can; you have always plenty of that.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, you're right--I know what you mean; I've got it here a\r\nlittle, as old Mr. Scourge says. [_Exeunt FRANKTON and LOVEYET._] But as\r\nfor what you said just now--no, no, sir; I'll never foutre you, I warrant\r\nyou--I always curses and swears in plain English, d' ye see--I--what's he\r\ngone? I hope he won't come back again for the sixth time; three times has\r\nhe been in and out within the circumference of a minute. But I won't stay\r\nhere no longer--I'll go and try if I can't find out where Doll lives, my\r\nold sweetheart; I an't so poor, but what I can buy her a ribbon or so; and,\r\nif all comes to all, I can get a new pair o' breeches too; for, to be sure,\r\nthis one doesn't look quite so decent, and if that doesn't fetch her, the\r\ndevil shall, as the old saying is. I'm cursedly afraid, I sha'n't be able\r\nto find out her quarters.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III. _MR. FRIENDLY'S House._\r\n\r\n_Enter HARRIET and MARIA._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Pray, Maria, how were you entertained at the Assembly last night?\r\n\r\nMARIA. Very indifferently, I assure you, my dear: You know, Harriet, I do\r\nmost cordially hate dancing at any time; but what must one do with one's\r\nself these irksome, heavy, dreary Winters? If it were not for cards, visits\r\nto and from, and----\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Assemblies.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Yes, as my last resource, Assemblies, I should absolutely be in a\r\nstate of despair before Spring.--Then one may take an excursion on York or\r\nLong-Island--an agreeable sail on the East-River--a walk in the Broadway,\r\nPharisee-like, to be seen of men, and--to see them--and then how refreshing\r\nto take a negligent stroll on the Battery, the Fort, the Mall, and from\r\nthence to Miss Such-a-one, then to Mrs. Such-a-one, then to Lady\r\nWhat's-her-name, and then home;--but now I am half of my time as motionless\r\nas Pitt's statue; as petrified and inanimate as an Egyptian mummy, or\r\nrather frozen snake, who crawls out of his hole now and then in this season\r\nto bask in the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. And whenever the sunshine of Mr. Frankton's eyes breaks upon you,\r\nyou revive.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Pshaw--I wish you had Mr. Frankton yourself, since you are so full\r\nof his sweet image.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I'm sure you did not wish so last night: Your eyes seem'd to\r\nsay,--I wish I could secure the good-for-nothing, agreeable rake.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Oh, you _heard_ my _eyes_ say so, did you? I ask pardon of your\r\npenetration.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. But do you really think the Winter is so destitute of comforts?\r\n\r\nMARIA. Ha, ha, comforts! by comforts I suppose you mean the sweets of\r\ndomestic life--the large portion of comfort arising from a large winter\r\nfire, and the very pleasing tittle-tattle of an antiquated maiden aunt, or\r\nthe equally pleasing (tho' less loquacious) society of a husband, who, with\r\na complaisance peculiar to husbands, responds--sometimes by a doubtful\r\nshrug, sometimes a stupid yawn, a lazy stretch, an unthinking stare, a\r\nclownish nod, a surly no, or interrogates you with a--humph? till bed time,\r\nwhen, heaven defend us! you are doom'd to be snor'd out of your wits till\r\nday-break, when----\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Hold, Maria--what a catalogue of uncomfortable comforts have you\r\nrun over.--Pleasure and Comfort are words which imply the same thing with\r\nme; but in this enlighten'd age, when words are so curiously refin'd and\r\ndefin'd, modern critics and fashionable word-mongers have, in the abundance\r\nof their wisdom, made a very nice distinction between them--for my part, I\r\nalways endeavour to reconcile modish pleasure with real comfort, and custom\r\nwith reason, as much as is in any way consistent with the obligation one is\r\nunder to conform a little to the perverse notions of mankind.\r\n\r\nMARIA. There now!--you know I can't abide to hear you moralize--prithee, my\r\ndear Harriet, leave that to grey beards and long-ear'd caps--everything is\r\nbeautiful in its season, you know.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Common sense and propriety are ever in season, Maria, and I was\r\ngoing to mention a _sentimental_ pleasure, a _rational_ enjoyment, which is\r\npeculiar to the present _season_, tho' beautiful in every one, if you had\r\nnot got frightened at the idea of being _comforted_.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Well, my dear comfortable, rational, sentimental Harriet! Let me\r\nhear what this rational enjoyment of yours is?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Hearing a good play, my dear.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Hearing a good play! why not seeing it, pray?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Because I believe plays are frequently seen, and not heard; at\r\nleast, not as they ought to be.\r\n\r\nMARIA. I protest you are quite a critic, Harriet.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. If you desire amusement, what so likely to beguile the heavy hours\r\nas Comedy? If your spirits are depress'd, what so replete with that which\r\ncan revive them as the laughter-loving Thalia? If the foibles and vices of\r\nhuman nature ought to suffer correction, in what way can they be satiriz'd\r\nso happily and successfully as on the stage;--or if elegance of language,\r\nand refinement of sentiment----\r\n\r\nMARIA. Humph--there's sentiment again.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You dislike every good thing I have mentioned this morning,\r\nMaria,--except one.\r\n\r\nMARIA. What's that, my dear?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Mr. Frankton.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Ha, ha. Why, to be sure, the good things of this life are not to be\r\ndespis'd, and men are not the worst creatures belonging to this life, nor\r\nMr. Frankton the worst of men, but--apropos, about plays--did you observe\r\nhow much I was affected the other night at the tragedy of Zara?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I really did not--I wish I had seen such a pleasing proof of your\r\nsensibility.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Oh, you cruel creature!--wish to see your friend in tears?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. 'Tis rather unusual to see a lady of your taste and spirit, either\r\nweep at a pathetic incident in tragedy, or laugh at a comic scene; and as\r\nfor the gentlemen, your lads of spirit, such as are falsely called _ladies'\r\nmen_, they are not so masculine as to understand, and, therefore, not so\r\neffeminate as to weep; tho' one would conclude, from their effeminacy in\r\nappearance and behaviour, that they would cry if you were to look at them.\r\n\r\nMARIA. To be sure, a little matter will draw tears from the feminine part\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. For your part, you seem'd to be neither laughing nor crying, but\r\nrather displeas'd and uneasy.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Oh, you mistake the matter entirely, my dear; your skill in\r\nphysiognomy is but indifferent, I find--why, after the tragedy was over, I\r\nlaugh'd most inordinately for a considerable time.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. On what account, pray?\r\n\r\nMARIA. Why, you must know, my dear, Mr. Frankton sat in the box opposite to\r\nthe one I was in.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Yes, I know your dear Mr. Frankton was in the opposite box.\r\n\r\nMARIA. My dear Mr. Frankton! Did I say so? Why I could not say more of him,\r\nwere he my husband.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. If you conform to custom, you would not say so much of a husband.\r\n\r\nMARIA. But I did not say any such thing. Says I, you must know, my dear\r\nHarriet----\r\n\r\nHARRIET. No, no, there was no Harriet mentioned.\r\n\r\nMARIA. But I say there was--so, as I was going to tell you, you must know,\r\nmy dear Harriet, that Mr. Frankton sat opposite to me at the theatre; and\r\nas he seem'd to be very much chagrin'd at the attention which was paid me\r\nby a couple of beaux, I took some pains to mortify him a little; for, tho'\r\nhe strove to hide his uneasiness by chattering, and whispering, and\r\ntittering, and shewing his white teeth, his embarrassment was very visible\r\nunder his affected unconcern.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. How exactly she has described her own situation and feelings!\r\n[_Aside._]--I find that you acquire _your skill in physiognomy_ from\r\nsympathy; or from making suitable comparisons, and drawing natural\r\ninferences from them; but now for the remainder of your pleasant anecdote,\r\nMaria.\r\n\r\nMARIA. So, I was extremely civil to my two worshipping votaries, grinn'd\r\nwhen they did, and talk'd as much nonsense as either of them. During this\r\nscene of mock-gallantry, one of my love-sick swains elevated his eyes in a\r\nmost languishing manner; and, clasping his sweet, unlucky hands together\r\nrather eagerly, my little dog Muff happen'd to be in the way, by which\r\nmeans my pet was squeez'd rather more than it lik'd, and my Adonis's finger\r\nbit by it so feelingly, that it would have delighted you to see how he\r\ntwisted his soft features about, with the excruciating anguish. Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Ha, ha, ha. Exceeding ludicrous indeed!--But pray, my dear\r\ncareless, sprightly Maria, was you not a little nettled to see Mr. Frankton\r\nand his nymphs so great? And are you not deeply in love with each other,\r\nnotwithstanding your coquetry at the theatre, and his levity at the\r\nAssembly?--Yes, yes,--your aversion to the dancing last night was only\r\npretence. I hope when your hearts are cemented by wedlock, you will both do\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nMARIA. It will be well if I do no worse; but, to hear you talk, one would\r\nswear you were not in love yourself.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Love is an amiable weakness, of which our sex are peculiarly\r\nsusceptible.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Ha, ha, ha; _of which our sex are peculiarly susceptible_--what an\r\nevasion!--and so my dear lovelorn, pensive, sentimental, romantic Harriet\r\nhas never experienced that same _amiable weakness_ which, it seems, the\r\nweaker sex is so susceptible of. But I won't tease you about Mr. Loveyet\r\nany more; adieu.\r\n\r\n                                                             [_Going._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Ha, ha; why in such sudden haste, my dear?\r\n\r\nMARIA. I have already made my visit longer than I intended, and I have\r\nplagu'd you enough now; adieu.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Ha, ha, ha; that is laughable enough.\r\n\r\n                                                [_Exeunt, separately._\r\n\r\n_End of the First Act._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT II.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I. _FRANKTON'S Lodgings._\r\n\r\n_FRANKTON and YOUNG LOVEYET sitting._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. When did you say you saw her?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Last night, in company with several other belles of no small\r\nnote, who did not look a tittle the handsomer for appearing at the same\r\ntime with her, I assure you.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Then she's as charming as ever.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Charming as ever! By all that's beautiful, a Seraphim is nothing\r\nto her! And as for Cherubims, when they compete with her,\r\n\r\n    _Conscious of her superior charms they stand,\r\n    And rival'd quite by such a beauteous piece\r\n    Of mortal composition; they, reluctant,\r\n    Hide their diminish'd heads._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. You extol her in very rapturous strains, George--I hope you have\r\nnot been smitten by her vast perfections, like the Cherubims.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I am really enraptur'd with the bewitching little Goddess!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Do you positively think her so much superior to the generality of\r\nwomen?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Most indubitably I do--don't you, pray?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I thought her handsome once--but--but--but you certainly are not\r\nin love with her.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Not I, faith. Ha, ha, ha. My enamorata and yours are two distinct\r\npersons, I assure you--and two such beauties!--By all that's desirable, if\r\nthere was only one more in the city who could vie with the lovely girls,\r\nand boast of the same elegantly proportioned forms; the same beauty,\r\ndelicacy and symmetry of features; the same celestial complexion, in which\r\nthe lily and carnation are equally excell'd; the same----\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Oh, monstrous! Why, they exceed all the Goddesses I ever heard of,\r\nby your account.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Well, if you had let me proceed, I should have told you that if\r\none more like them could be found in town, they would make a more beautiful\r\ntriple than the three renowned goddesses who were candidates for beauty and\r\na golden apple long ago; but no matter now.--The account you have given of\r\nthe lovely Harriet, has rekindled the flame she so early inspir'd me with,\r\nand I already feel myself all the lover; how then shall I feel, when I once\r\nmore behold the dear maid, like the mother of mankind--\"with grace in all\r\nher steps, heaven in her eye; in every gesture, dignity and love!\"\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Aye--and what do you think of your father's sending for you to\r\nmarry you to this same beautiful piece of mortality?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Is it possible? Then I am happy indeed! But this surpasses my most\r\nsanguine hopes!\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Did you suppose he would object to the alliance then?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I did not know,--my hope was only founded on the _probability_ of\r\nhis approving it.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Well, I can now inform you that your hope has a better basis to\r\nrest on, and that there is as fair a prospect of its being shortly\r\nswallowed up in fruition as ever Cupid and Hymen presented to a happy\r\nmortal's view.--For your farther comfort, I have the pleasure to acquaint\r\nyou, that Mr. Trueman is equally fond of the match.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Better and better--my dear George! You are the best of\r\nfriends,--my happy genius! My very guardian angel!\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Well said, Heroics--come, spout away.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Yes, I _am_ happy, very happy, indeed: Moralists disparage this\r\nworld too much,--there _is_ such a thing as happiness under the sun,--I\r\n_feel_ it now most irrefragably,--_here_ it vibrates in a most extatic\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Why, you are positively the arrantest love-sick swain that ever\r\nhad recourse to a philter.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Profane heretic in love! Did not you extol the two Seraphims just\r\nnow in the same generous language? But you have never experienced the\r\nblissful transition from doubt and solicitude to certainty and peace, as I\r\ndo now.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. How do you know that?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I only conjecture so--Did you ever feel the same transports I do?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. How, in the name of sense, should I know how you feel?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Feel!--I feel that kind heaven, my friend, my father, and my\r\ndearest girl, all conspire to bless me!\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. There he rides his hobby-horse again.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Aye, and a generous horse he is--he carries me very pleasantly, I\r\nassure you.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Yes, and, I dare say, could convey you more agreeably and\r\nspeedily to Paradise than the Ass did Mahomet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Ha, ha. I think you have improved my idea.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. To improve your reason, and check your strange delirium, I have.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I will talk more dispassionately;--but my heart _will_ palpitate\r\nat the thought of meeting the lovely source of its joy, and the ultimatum\r\nof all its wishes!\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I suppose you know she lives with Mr. Friendly.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. With Mr. Friendly!\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Yes, she is nearly related to his family, and as the style in\r\nwhich they live, corresponds with her former prosperity better than the\r\npresent ineligible situation of her father does, he has granted them her\r\nvaluable company, after their repeated solicitations had prov'd the\r\nsincerity of their regard.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. But how do you account for Mr. Trueman's poverty, since fortune\r\nhas lately put it so much in Harriet's power to relieve him from it? I dare\r\nnot think it arises from her want of filial regard; I do not know anything\r\nso likely to abate the ardour of my attachment as a knowledge of that; but\r\nit is an ungenerous suggestion, unworthy the benignity and tenderness of\r\nthe gentle Harriet.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. It is so.--Two things, on the part of the old gentleman, are the\r\ncause: his pride will not suffer him to be the subject of a daughter's\r\nbounty; and his regard for that daughter's welfare, makes him fearful of\r\nbeing instrumental in impairing her fortune.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I thought the angelic girl could not be ungrateful to the parent\r\nof her being; but don't let us tarry--I am already on the wing.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. You are too sanguine; you must not expect to succeed without a\r\nlittle opposition.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. How! what say you? pray be explicit.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I will remove your suspense.--There is a Mr. Worthnought, a thing\r\nby some people call'd a man, a beau, a fine gentleman, a smart fellow; and\r\nby others a coxcomb, a puppy, a baboon and an ass.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And what of him?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Nothing; only he visits Miss Harriet frequently.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Hah!--and does she countenance his addresses?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I'll explain.--He imagines she is fond of him, because she does\r\nnot actually discard him; upon which presumption he titters, capers, vows,\r\nbows, talks scraps of French, and sings an amorous lay--with such an\r\nirresistibly languishing air, that she cannot do less than compliment\r\nhim--on the fineness of his voice, for instance; the smartness of his\r\nrepartees, the brilliancy of his wit, the gaiety and vivacity of his\r\ntemper, his genteel carriage, his handsome person, his winning address,\r\nhis----\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Hah! you surely cannot be in earnest, Frankton.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. To be serious then,--the sum total of the affair, I take to be\r\nthis.--In order to kill a heavy hour, she sometimes suffers the fool to be\r\nin her company, because the extravagance of his behaviour, and the\r\nemptiness of his upper region furnish her with a good subject for ridicule;\r\nbut _your_ presence will soon make him dwindle into his primitive\r\ninsignificance.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. If your prediction proves false, Harriet will be false\r\nindeed;--but I must see her straightway.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I think you go pretty well fraught with the fruits of our united\r\ndeliberations.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Deliberations!--away with the musty term--\r\n\r\n    _No caution need my willing footsteps guide;--\r\n    When Love impels--what evil can betide?\r\n    Patriots may fear, their rulers lack more zeal,\r\n    And nobly tremble for the public weal;\r\n    To front the battle, and to fear no harm,\r\n    The _shield_ must glitter on the warrior's arm:\r\n    Let such dull prudence _their_ designs attend,\r\n    But _Love_, unaided, _shall_ obtain its end!_\r\n\r\n                                                            [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II. _OLD LOVEYET'S House._\r\n\r\n_Enter OLD LOVEYET and TRUEMAN._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I tell you it is the most infernal scheme that ever was devis'd.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. And I tell you, sir, that your argument is heterodox, sophistical,\r\nand most preposterously illogical.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I insist upon it, sir, you know nothing at all about the matter;\r\nand, give me leave to tell you, sir--\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. What--give you leave to tell me I know nothing at all about the\r\nmatter! I shall do no such thing, sir--I'm not to be govern'd by your _ipse\r\ndixit_.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I desire none of your musty Latin, sir, for I don't understand it,\r\nnot I.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Oh, the ignorance of the age! To oppose a plan of government like\r\nthe new Constitution. Like it, did I say?--There never was one like\r\nit:--neither Minos, Solon, Lycurgus nor Romulus, ever fabricated so wise a\r\nsystem;--why it is a political phenomenon, a prodigy of legislative wisdom,\r\nthe fame of which will soon extend almost _ultramundane_, and astonish the\r\nnations of the world with its transcendent excellence.--To what a sublime\r\nheight will the superb edifice attain!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Your aspiring edifice shall never be erected in _this_ State, sir.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Mr. Loveyet, you will not listen to reason: only attend calmly one\r\nmoment--[_Reads._]--\"We the people of the United States, in order to form a\r\nmore perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquillity,\r\nprovide--\"\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I tell you I won't hear it.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Mark all that. [_Reads again._] \"Section the first.--All\r\nlegislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the\r\nUnited States, which shall consist of a Senate and House of\r\nRepresentatives.\" Very judicious and salutary, upon my erudition.--\"Section\r\nthe second--\"\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'll hear no more of your sections.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. \"Section the second.--The House of Representatives--\"\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. They never shall represent me, I promise them.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Why, you won't hear me out.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I have heard enough to set me against it.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You have not heard a _quantum sufficit_ to render you competent to\r\ngive a decisive opinion; besides, you hear with passion and prejudice.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I don't care for that; I say it is a devilish design upon our\r\nliberty and property; by my body, it is;--it would reduce us to poverty and\r\nslavery.\r\n\r\n_Enter HUMPHRY, listening._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. What's that about liberty, and property, and slavery, and popery,\r\nand the devil? I hope the pope and the devil an't come to town for to play\r\nthe devil, and make nigers of us!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You will have it your own way.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. To be sure I will--in short, sir, the old Constitution is good\r\nenough for me.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I wonder what Constitution magnifies.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. The old Constitution!--ha, ha, ha, ha. Superlatively ludicrous and\r\nfacetious, upon my erudition; and highly productive of risibility--ha, ha,\r\nha. The old Constitution! A very shadow of a government--a perfect _caput\r\nmortuum_;--why, one of my schoolboys would make a better: 'tis grown as\r\nsuperannuated, embecilitated, valetudinarianated, invalidated, enervated\r\nand dislocated as an old man of sixty odd.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Ah, that's me--that's me--sixty odd, eigh--[_Aside._] I--I--ugh,\r\nugh, I know what you want:--a consolidation and annihilation of the States.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. A consolidation and annihilation!--You certainly have bid defiance\r\nto the first rudiments of grammar, and sworn war against the whole body of\r\nlexicographers. Mercy on me! If words are to be thus abus'd and perverted,\r\nthere is an end of the four grand divisions of grammar at once: If\r\nconsolidation and annihilation are to be us'd synonymously, there is a\r\ntotal annihilation of all the moods, tenses, genders, persons, nouns,\r\npronouns, verbs, adverbs, substantives, conjunctions, interjections,\r\nprepositions, participles,--\r\n\r\n                                                            [_Coughs._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Oh dear, oh dear,--what a wise man a Schoolmaster is!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. How can the States be consolidated and annihilated too? If they\r\nare consolidated or compounded into one national mass, surely the\r\nindividual States cannot be annihilated, for, if they were annihilated,\r\nwhere would be the States to compose a consolidation?--Did you ever study\r\nLogic, sir?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. No, but I've studied common sense tho', and that tells me I am\r\nright, and consequently you are wrong; there, that's as good logic as\r\nyours.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You mean Paine's _Common Sense_, I suppose--yes, yes, there you\r\nmanifest something like common sense, Mr. Loveyet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. 'Tis no such thing, sir; it lately took three speakers, and much\r\nbetter ones than Paine, no less than three whole days, to prove that\r\nconsolidation and annihilation are one and the same thing.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. An execrable Triumvirate--a _scandalum magnatum_ to all public\r\nbodies: I suppose they and their adherents are now sitting in Pandemonium,\r\nexcogitating their diabolical machinations against us.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. A pack of nonsensical stuff!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Harkee, Mr. Loveyet, I will propound a problem to you. We will\r\nsuppose there are two parallel lines drawn on this floor, which,\r\nnotwithstanding they may be very contiguous to each other, and advance _ad\r\ninfinitum_, can never approximate so near as to effect a junction, in which\r\nfundamental axiom all mathematicians profess a perfect congruity and\r\nacquiescence:--now, to elucidate the hypothesis a little, we will suppose\r\nhere is one line; and we will further suppose here is another line. [_Draws\r\nhis cane over LOVEYET'S feet, which makes him jump._] Now we will suppose\r\nthat line is you, and this line is compos'd, form'd, constituted, made up\r\nof discernment, political knowledge, public spirit, and true\r\nrepublicanism,--but, as I predicated antecedently, _that_ line is\r\nyou--[_Striking his cane on LOVEYET'S feet._] You must not forget _that_.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. S'death, sir, do you mean to make a mathematical instrument of me,\r\nto try experiments with?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Now take notice--as the East is to the West, the North Pole to the\r\nSouth ditto, the Georgium Sidus to this terraqueous globe, or the\r\nAborigines of America to the Columbians of this generation, so is that line\r\nto this line, or Mr. Loveyet to true wisdom and judgment; sometimes\r\nappearing to verge towards a coalition with them, but never to effect it.\r\nThere, sir,--in this argument, you have a major, a minor and a conclusion,\r\nconsonant to the received principles of logic.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Confound your senseless comparisons; your problems, your\r\nmathematics, and your Georgium Sidus.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye, confound your gorgon hydras, I say too.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Here you have been spending your breath to prove--what?--that I am\r\nnot a rational human being, but a mathematical line.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I know you are not a mathematical line; you are not the twentieth\r\npart so straight and well made;--I only wish to convince you that the\r\npresent government is an _ignis fatuus_ that is leading you and thousands\r\nmore to ruin.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. But I don't choose to be convinc'd by you.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. No more than you'll be convinc'd you are sixty years old, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Now see there again, see there! isn't this enough to try Job's\r\npatience? I'll let you know that my bodily and political Constitutions are\r\nboth good, sir, both sound alike.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I know they are. Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Pray, old gentleman, what sort of things may them same\r\nconstitutions be?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Avaunt, thou plebeian, thou ignoramus!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, I lay now I can say that as good as you, for all you're such\r\na fine scholard.--I won't be plain, thou ignorant mouse.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. \"_Monstrum horrendum, cui lumen ademptum!_\"\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Monstrous memorandums, cu--no, I can't say that; that's too hard\r\nfor me. Well, what a glorious thing it is for to have good larning.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Sixty odd years indeed! provoking wretch!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. What a bloody passion he's in!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Pray, Mr. Loveyet, do not anathematize me so;--if you do not\r\ncivilize your phraseology a little, I must have recourse to a little\r\ncastigation, for, _necessitas non habet legem_, you know, Mr. Loveyet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I know nothing about such nonsense, not I.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You are the most unenlightened, contumacious, litigious, petulant,\r\nopprobrious, proditorious, misanthropic mortal I ever confabulated a\r\ncolloquy with; by the dignity of my profession you are.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. What monstrous queer words he discourses the old fellow with!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Mighty pleasant and witty, by my body; sixty years, forsooth!--But\r\nI'll be aveng'd of you.--Your daughter sha'n't have my son--there,\r\nsir,--how do you like that? Sixty years, indeed! Ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. What an old reprobate it is! He swears till he sweats again.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. What an unlucky affair!                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And give me leave to tell you, Mr. Schoolmaster, I was an\r\nold--I--I mean--I was a _great_ fool to disparage him so much as to think\r\nof the match.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Illiberal aspersion! But were I as contemptible as you think me, a\r\ndisastrous war has rendered me so; and as for my child, Providence has\r\nplaced her above dependence on an unfortunate father: the bequest of a\r\nworthy relation has made her, what the world calls, rich; but her mind--is\r\nfar richer; the most amiable temper, improved by a virtuous and refined\r\neducation (not to mention her beauty) deservedly makes her the object of\r\ngeneral love and respect, and renders your present resolution a matter of\r\nperfect indifference to me.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Well, well, so be it; but you never shall be Charles's\r\nfather-in-law, for all that--that's as fix'd as fate,--you may beg my\r\nforgiveness for your faults by and by, but your daughter shall never be\r\nmine, I promise you.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Conceited old sot!                                   [_Exit._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. He's gone at last.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What brought _you_ here, pray?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, my legs, to be sure.--Here, old gentleman, if you'll promise\r\nyou won't get in such a passion as you did just now, I've got some news to\r\ntell you.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I in a passion? 'tis no such thing--I didn't mind anything he\r\nsaid, because he's old and fretful;--but what news, eigh--what news?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Here's a letter for you.              [_Gives it to LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Opens the letter and reads._] I am heartily glad, 'faith!\r\n[_Reads again._]--'Od's my life, I'm as happy as the Great Mogul, and as\r\ngood-natur'd--\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. That's clever; I likes to see people good-natur'd,--it makes me as\r\nhappy as the Great Pogul.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'll go tell old Trueman's daughter, Charles is coming, but not\r\nfor her--I know she'll be mortify'd, poor girl, but I can't help that. Who\r\ngave you this letter?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why your son, to be sure.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. When did you leave the _Havanna_, pray?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. The _Havanna_?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Yes, are you not from the West-Indies?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Who--me?--not I.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Why, what the plague makes you think he was my son, then?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Because he said you was his father--that's a good reason, an't it?\r\nBut it's a wise son knows his own father, as the old saying is.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. How can that be, when the letter is dated in the Island of Cuba,\r\nthe twentieth day of January, and he says he don't expect to leave it till\r\nthe beginning of March, and this is only February, so it is impossible he\r\nshou'd be here yet.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. May be you an't the old gentleman, then.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. To be sure I an't an _old_ gentleman. Did he say I was old, eigh?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, I believe he did.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I believe you lie--and I'll let you know that I an't old enough to\r\nbe his father, you--\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Well, if the case lies there, that settles the harsh, d' ye see;\r\nbut, for my part, I think how you look old enough and ugly enough to be his\r\ngreat-grandfather, as the old saying is.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Sirrah, get out of my house, or I'll break your bones for you.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I'm a going--howsomever, give me the letter again; you've got no\r\nbusiness with it--you an't his father.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. You lie! I am his father--if he was here, he wou'dn't deny it.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, he is here, I tell you--here in New-York. I suppose how he's\r\nmade a small mistake about the day of the month, and says he's just arrived\r\nfrom the East-Indies, for he's cursed apt for to make blunders;--that about\r\nthe corn and the pigs; ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Do you laugh at me, you vagabond?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Not I, old gentleman; I've got too much respect for old age, I'll\r\ninsure you.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I shall go distracted!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Put on your spectacles and look again--I'm sure your eyes must\r\nperceive you, for I'll give my corporal oath he an't in the East-Indies.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. It is not the East-Indies, you great calf; you mean the\r\nWest-Indies.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No matter if it's East or West; the odds an't much for the matter\r\no' that.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What an abominable fool!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I'm no more a fool than you are--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Be gone, you scoundrel! Here, Thomas--[_Enter THOMAS._], lug this\r\nfellow out of doors.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No, you sha'n't tho', d' ye see.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS.

By strictly attending to these excellent\r\nmaxims, I am worth about five and twenty per cent. more than any other\r\nmerchant in the city; and as for that stupid proverb, money is the root of\r\nall evil, 'tis well enough for those to say so, who have none; for my part,\r\nI know that much of the good things of this world is better than not\r\nenough--that a man can live longer upon a hundred thousand pounds than one\r\nthousand pounds--that if, the more we have the more we want, the more we\r\nhave the more we make--and that it is better to make hay while the sun\r\nshines _against_ a rainy day, when I shall be upon my last legs, than to\r\nwork and toil like an ass _in_ the rain; so it plainly appears that money\r\nis the root of all good;--that's my logic.--I long to see the young rogue\r\ntho'--I dare say he looks very like his father;--but, had I thought old\r\nTrueman wou'd have us'd me so ill, I wou'd not have wrote for him yet; for\r\nhe shall not have his old sweetheart:--if he offers to disobey me in this\r\nrespect, by my body, I'll disinherit the ungracious dog immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III. _Another part of LOVEYET'S House._\r\n\r\n_DOLLY and THOMAS._\r\n\r\nTHOMAS.

[_Exeunt, severally._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II. _A Street._\r\n\r\n_Enter YOUNG LOVEYET and HUMPHRY._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Not find where he lives?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No;--you're the most unluckiest gentleman for making of\r\nblunders,--didn't you tell me how your father liv'd in number two hundred\r\nand fifty, in Queen-Street, in the three-story brick house?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I did; is not that the house?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No--why, your father don't live there.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Did you enquire for Mr. Loveyet?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, I saw Mr. Loveyet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. The devil is in the fellow, I believe. Did you give him my letter?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, but I didn't want to.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Why not?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Becase I wanted for to carry it to your father.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What makes you think Mr. Loveyet is not my father?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Somebody told me so that's got a good right to know; I've his own\r\nwords for it.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. My father tell you so?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. The young man is crazy, I believe.--I say Mr. Loveyet said you\r\nwasn't his son; so I suppose he can't be your father by that.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I forgot that the letter would probably produce this\r\nmisunderstanding. [_Aside._]--He is the only one I know, whom I have a\r\nright to call my father.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. May be you're the old fellow's bastard, and if you're a bastard,\r\nyou can't be a son, you know: aye, that's the catch, I suppose.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Your new clothes make you quite smart, Mr. Cubb.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, don't I look quite smart, with these here new clothes?\r\nthey're all new, I'll insure you--only a little the worse for wear; I\r\nbought 'em at the vandue option, at the Fly-Market.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. But how came you by that patch on one side of your face, and that\r\nlarge crop of beard on the other?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Mounsieur, the outlandish barber, give me a small cut across the\r\nwhiskers; but the best of all you ha'n't seen yet;--see here.\r\n\r\n                                                 [_Pulls off his hat._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Aye, now you look something like--quite fierce--entirely the fine\r\ngentleman, upon my falsehood. A genteel dress is the very soul of a man,\r\nMr. Cubb.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Like enough, for I've got more soul to shew myself, now I cut such\r\na dash; I've got a soul to see the shews at the play-house; and, I think,\r\nI've got a great deal more soul to spend a few shillings at the ale-house.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. That's true; I'm glad you remind me of my promise.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Not I, I didn't remind you,--I scorn it.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I dare say you do. [_Gives him money._] There, drink my health\r\nwith that.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. With all my heart--soul, I mean;--aye, here's soul\r\nenough--[_Jingling the money._]--to buy the matter o' twenty mugs;--come,\r\nlet's go at once.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I?--excuse me, sir; I have particular business elsewhere.--Sir,\r\nyour most humble servant.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Sir, I am your most humble sarvint too. [_Bows awkwardly._]\r\n\r\n                                                 [_Exeunt, severally._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III. _MR. FRIENDLY'S House._\r\n\r\n_Enter HARRIET._\r\n\r\n[_Knocking at the door._] What an incessant knocking! Mr. Friendly's family\r\nare out, and between their company and my own, I expect to be engaged all\r\nday: I am fairly tired of these morning visits;--they are fashionable, and,\r\ntherefore, agreeable, to those who can make propriety and happiness\r\nsubservient to custom and false politeness; but, for my part--\r\n\r\n_Enter SERVANT._\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Miss Airy is waiting in her carriage, madam.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Admit her. [_Exit SERVANT._] She is the only one I wish to see\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\n_Enter MARIA._\r\n\r\nMARIA. My dear Harriet, I am rejoic'd to find you at home;--I this minute\r\nheard something, which I knew would make you happy; and that, I trust, is a\r\ngood excuse for troubling you twice a day with my company.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You wrong my friendship, Maria, if you think you can oblige me too\r\noften with your desirable company; 'tis true I was wishing for a little\r\ncessation of that torrent of formal visitors which is pouring in from\r\nmorning till night; but far be it from Harriet to reckon her Maria among\r\nthat number.\r\n\r\nMARIA. You are very good, my dear; but you must give me leave to be a\r\nlittle jealous that I am not the only one who is favoured with such a\r\npreference.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Indeed, I do not know any one I have a particular desire to see\r\nthis morning, except yourself.\r\n\r\nMARIA. You forget Mr. Loveyet, when you say so.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Poh! I am not talking of men.\r\n\r\nMARIA. No; but it is very probable you are _thinking_ of _a man_.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. And pray what reason have you to think, that my thoughts run upon\r\nsuch an improper subject?\r\n\r\nMARIA. _Improper subject_,--ha, ha, ha. So my very discreet, prudish little\r\nHarriet never lets man enter into her head; tho' it is pretty notorious\r\nsomebody has enter'd into her heart long ago.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Your discernment must be very subtle, if you know all that is in\r\nmy heart.\r\n\r\nMARIA. I only judge of your heart, by your tongue; and the abundance of the\r\nformer is generally inferred from the speech of the latter.--Yes, yes--that\r\nconstant, hypocritical heart of yours is now throbbing with love, hope,\r\ncuriosity, and--a thousand speechless sensations, the improper subject of\r\nwhich, I do not hesitate to declare, is odious man; and that man, the\r\naccomplished Mr. Loveyet.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Pshaw,--how can you tantalize one so?\r\n\r\nMARIA. Well, well, it shall not be serv'd like Tantalus any more: _he_ was\r\ndoom'd to behold; and, beholding, to wish and languish for the tempting\r\ndraught, in vain: but a better doom awaits the happy Harriet;--what she\r\ndesires is not thus interdicted, but will soon be obtain'd, and--\r\n\r\nHARRIET. How strangely you talk, Maria.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Well, I will not keep you in suspense any longer. Old Mr. Loveyet\r\nhas received a letter from his son, signifying his intention to leave the\r\nWest-Indies shortly after its date, so you may expect to see him very soon.\r\nThen hey for a wedding, &c.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Ha, ha; you are a droll girl.\r\n\r\nMARIA. But my time is precious; I am just going to the widow\r\nAffable's:--about twelve months ago she paid me a visit, when, agreeably to\r\nthe form in such cases made and provided, she beg'd I would be more\r\nsociable, and she would take it so kindly of me:--accordingly I shall step\r\nin _en passant_, to shew her my sociability and kindness, which I shall,\r\nperhaps, repeat at the end of another year.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. How can you be so cruel? The pleasure I experience in your\r\nsociety, makes me regret that any one should be deprived of it.\r\n\r\nMARIA. That is very strange:--I should imagine, if you priz'd my company so\r\nmuch, you would wish me to withhold it from others; because, the more I\r\nbless them with my presence, the less will come to your share, you know, my\r\ndear;--nor is it easy to conceive how you could be so fond of my sweet\r\nperson, without being jealous at the partiality of others;--but, after all,\r\ngood people, they say, are scarce; and my humble admirers shall find the\r\nsaying verified in me; because they are not fully sensible of my superior\r\nvalue; but, since you prove the contrary, by extolling my conversation and\r\nfriendship so much, I likewise shall observe a contrary conduct, and\r\nindulge you with a _tête-à-tête_ frequently, my dear.--But I have fifty\r\nplaces to call at yet:--I am to wait on Miss Nancy Startup, Miss Biddy\r\nDresswise, Miss Gaudy, Miss Titterwell, Mrs. Furbelow, Mrs. Neverhome,\r\nMrs--_et cætera, et cætera_; which visits I mean to pay with all the\r\nformality and fashionable shortness in my power: from thence I shall\r\nproceed to Mademoiselle Mincit, the milliner; from thence to two or three\r\nscore of shops in William-Street, to buy a prodigious number of important--\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Trifles.\r\n\r\nMARIA. You are right, my dear;--as I live, I would not be one of those\r\nofficious \"Nothing else, Ma'ms?\" for all the goods from the North Church to\r\nMaiden-Lane.--Adieu,--I leave you to meditate on what I have told you.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Farewell. [_Exit MARIA._] Now Maria is gone, I will see no more\r\ncompany.--If anything can be an excuse for a falsehood, the present\r\noccasion offers a very good one:--I feel my mind pretty much at ease, and I\r\ndo not choose to have it disturbed by the impertinence of pretended\r\nfriends.--Who is there?\r\n\r\n_Enter SERVANT._\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Madam.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Whoever calls to see me to-day, remember I am not at home.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Mr. Worthnought is here now, Madam; must I deny you to him?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Undoubtedly. [_Exit SERVANT._] I am disgusted with the repetition\r\nof that coxcomb's nonsense.--[_Sighs._]--I wish Charles was here:--In spite\r\nof the false delicacy of that tyrant, Custom, which forbids us to speak the\r\nexquisite effusions of a susceptible heart, I can now speak boldly, while\r\nthat heart dictates to the willing tongue what complacence it feels at the\r\nprospect of its Charles's return.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. _Another part of MR. FRIENDLY'S House._\r\n\r\n_WORTHNOUGHT, discovered solus._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Who comes here! He sha'n't see her, if I don't,\r\n'foregad--Curse me, but he shall go away with a flea in his ear.\r\n\r\n_Enter YOUNG LOVEYET, followed by HUMPHRY._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Mr. Lovit--Mr. Lovit.--[_Takes him aside._] As I was a going\r\nalong, d'ye see, I see you pop in here, and so I follow'd you, to tell you,\r\nhow old Mr. Lovit said he was intend for to go for to see the old fellow's\r\ndaughter, to tell her something about the letter. Don't Mrs. Harriet live\r\nhere?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'll make haste, and supersede the design of his\r\nerrand, if possible;--it would be a pity he should come before I had\r\nappriz'd Harriet I was not in the West-Indies. [_Aside._]--I am\r\nobliged to you for your information.                    [_To HUMPHRY._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Thank 'e, as the saying is. [_Going,--WORTHNOUGHT whispers with\r\nhim._]--What's that to you?--How clumsy mounsieur has dress'd his\r\ncalabash!--Powder'd over the face and eyes.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. I wish I knew what he wanted with him;--perhaps it is\r\nsomething about me.                                          [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What Butterfly is this we have here!--I suppose it is the fop,\r\nFrankton mentioned.                                          [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Sir, I have the honour to be, with the profoundest respect\r\nand esteem, your most obedient, most devoted, and most obliged humble\r\nslave, _foy d'Homme d'Honneur_--Tol lol, &c.                 [_Sings._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. A very pompous salutation, truly. [_Aside._]--Your polite address\r\ndoes me too much honour, sir;--I cannot conceive how you can be my obliged\r\nslave, as I do not recollect I ever saw you before.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Why, sir, I'll tell you:--Your appearance, sir, bespeaks the\r\ngentleman of distinction, sir,--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. My _appearance_;--superficial coxcomb!              [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. 'Tis true, my words were words of course; but I meant every\r\nword, sir, 'pon hanor.--\"Cupid, Gad of saft persuasion, &c.\"\r\n                                 [_Sings affectedly, and takes snuff._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Humph,--To whom, sir, am I indebted, for so much civility?\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Dick Worthnought, esquire, at your service, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. The very fool.                                      [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. And give me leave to add, sir, that I feel the highest\r\nfelicity, that you have given me so good an opportunity of asking you, in\r\nmy turn, for the favour of your name, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. My name is Loveyet, sir.--With what solemnity the coxcomb talks!\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. A native of this city, I presume, Mr. Loveyet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I am, sir; but I have been absent for some years, and, as I was a\r\nyouth when I left the city, I cannot be supposed to have retained much of\r\nthe Yorker.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Pardon me, sir;--to a person of penetration, the Yorker is\r\nstill conspicuous under the disguise of the foreigner; and I am proud to\r\nhave the hanor of being your countryman, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I fancy the honour is by no means reciprocal.       [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. You are acquainted with Miss Harriet Trueman, I presume, Mr.\r\nLoveyet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I was formerly acquainted with the lady.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. You must know, sir, that your humble servant has the hanor and\r\nfelicity of being that lady's very humble admirer.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I dare say she is admired by all who have the pleasure of knowing\r\nher.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Give me leave, sir,--I mean her lover.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Conceited ape!                                      [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. _You_ have no pretensions, sir, I presume.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Pretensions?\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Aye, sir; I thought you might have a small _penchant_, as the\r\nFrench call it;--you apprehend me; but she don't intend to see company\r\nto-day. I am monstrously chagrin'd, sir, 'foregad, that I have it not in my\r\npower to introduce you to the divine mistress of my heart; but, as matters\r\nare circumstanc'd, I think it is not worth our while to stay.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I mean to see Miss Trueman before I shall think so.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Oh, fie, sir;--you wou'd not force a lady to give you her\r\ncompany against her inclination:--perhaps, indeed, she may appear to\r\nreceive you with some warmth, and you may flatter yourself you have fairly\r\nmade a canquest of her, and think Dick Worthnought esquire, is out-rival'd;\r\nbut if so, you are most demnably bit, 'foregad, for she's as slippery as\r\nice, tho' not quite so cold;--she is the very standard of true modern\r\ncoquetry, the quintessence of the _beau-monde_, and the completest example\r\nof New-York levity, that New-York has the hanor to call its beautiful\r\ninhabitant: ha, ha,--she'll jilt you;--however, the dear creature, with all\r\nher amiable foibles, has been so profuse of her attention to me, that I\r\nshould be ungrateful not to acknowledge the various favours she has hanor'd\r\nme with.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Consummate impudence! [_Aside._]--Miss Trueman's character is well\r\nknown, sir.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Miss Trueman's character! Demme, sir, do you mean to say\r\nanything against her character?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. No;--and I will take care you shall not, with impunity.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. You are the most unmannerly fellow I ever convers'd with, 'pan\r\nhanor.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And you the most contemptible puppy; or that fellow would be\r\nunmannerly enough to chastise you for your insolence.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. That's a demnable rub, demme;--curse him, I'm afraid he isn't\r\nafraid of me, after all. [_Aside._]--You wou'd find me as brave as yourself\r\nthen; demme, but you wou'd.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'll try you. [_Offers to cane him, which makes him cry out.--Then\r\nenter HARRIET, hastily._]\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Oh, dear!--what's the matter?\r\n\r\n                                       [_Seeing CHARLES, she shrieks._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. My dearest,--my adorable Harriet!\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Is it possible? I did not dream that Mr. Loveyet was the person\r\nwho wanted to see me.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And am I again blest with a sight of the dear object of all my\r\nwishes and affections!--I thank you, heaven; you have been bountiful,\r\nindeed! The rolling billows, under your propitious guidance, have at length\r\nwafted me to my native land, to love and my dear Harriet.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. What the devil does he mean!                    [_Aside._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Your unexpected appearance, and the unaccountable circumstance\r\nwhich attends it, have discomposed me in such a manner, that I cannot\r\nexpress, as I wish, how happy I am in your safe arrival.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Hah,--happy in his arrival! If so, she will not be very\r\nhappy in his rival, I'm afraid.                              [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I will explain the occasion of my charmer's fright\r\nimmediately;--at present I can only tell you that your wou'd-be lover,\r\nhere--\r\n\r\nHARRIET. My lover!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. So he confidently call'd himself, and took such other insufferably\r\nvain and impudent freedoms with your name, that I attempted to give him a\r\nlittle wholesome admonition with this, if his effeminate cries had not\r\nbrought my lovely Harriet in to prevent me; but the very attempt has proved\r\nhim to be the basest of dastards. [_While he is saying this, WORTHNOUGHT\r\nmakes several attempts to interrupt him._]\r\n\r\nHARRIET. [_To WORTHNOUGHT._] I am equally surpriz'd and incens'd, sir, that\r\nyou would dare to take such freedoms with my name.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Be assured, Miss Harriet, if you condescend to grant your valuable\r\ncompany to such superficial gentry, they will ever prove themselves as\r\nunworthy of it as he has; but your goodness does not let you suspect the\r\nuse which such characters make of the intimacy they are honour'd with, or\r\nyou would spurn their unmeaning flattery, and ridiculous fopperies, with\r\nindignation.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I ever till now consider'd him as a respectful, well-meaning\r\nperson, as far as regarded myself; and as such, gave him a prudent share of\r\nmy civilities; but I never thought either his intellects or his person\r\nsufficient to entitle him to a partial intimacy.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. You cannot deny, madam, that I have repeatedly experienced the\r\nmost flattering proofs of your partiality, that a lady (who values her\r\nreputation) can ever bestow on her admirer.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Contemptible thing! An admirer, forsooth! Of what?--Your ideas are\r\ntoo mean and frothy to let you admire anything but my dress, or some other\r\ntrifle as empty and superficial as the trifler I am speaking to. My\r\ndemeanour towards you was nothing but the effect of cheerfulness and\r\npoliteness; qualities which, I believe, are inherent in me, and of which,\r\ntherefore, all with whom I am acquainted are the objects; but your present\r\nunmanly and insupportably impudent discourse, makes me despise myself\r\nalmost as much as you, for allowing such a wretch even that small degree of\r\nattention which he so illy deserved.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. You are very insulting, madam, 'pan hanor.--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. How apt such fellows are to have _honour_ in their mouths.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. This is only a trick to conceal your inconstancy during his\r\nabsence; but it is the nature of the sex to deceive us.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. 'Tis the nature of a fool to say so; and if that fool does not\r\ninstantly quit the subject and the house together, I must request the\r\nfavour of Mr. Loveyet to make him.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. \"As matters are circumstanced, Mr. Worthnought, I think it is not\r\nworth your while to stay.\"\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Her unparallel'd rudeness shall not compel me to leave the\r\nhouse, till I please.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. \"Oh, fie, sir,--you would not force a lady to give you her company\r\nagainst her inclination.\"\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. You are very fond of echoing my words, it seems.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Yes, when I can apply them to your disappointment and\r\ndisgrace.--\"I am monstrously chagrin'd, sir, 'foregad, that I have it not\r\nin my power to introduce you to the divine mistress of my heart.\" Ha, ha,\r\nha.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. 'Tis very well,--I will have revenge;--if the laws of\r\npoliteness (which I would rather die than infringe) did not forbid swearing\r\nbefore a _lady_ [_In a contemptuous tone._], curse me, but I would d----n\r\nyou for a--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Interrupting him._]--\"You must know, sir, I have the hanor and\r\nfelicity of being this lady's very humble admirer.\"--You have failed in\r\nyour predictions, I think, sir.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Yes, and she shall soon pay for her duplicity; tho' I would\r\nnot have you think that her ill usage mortifies me in the least: I never\r\nwas in love with her, nor did I ever intend marriage, which is more than\r\n_she_ can say; and, I believe, it is fortunate for us both, that you\r\narriv'd when you did, or something might have happened, which would have\r\nobliged me to marry her, merely to prevent her from being miserable.--Ha,\r\nha, ha. Tol lol, &c.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. What a superlative wretch!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. He is too contemptible to cost you a thought, Harriet:--none but\r\nthe puppy tribe, and a few splenetic old maids, will pay any attention to\r\nhis slander; they, no doubt, will spread it with avidity;--but to be\r\ntraduced by such, is to be praised.--Hah!--there comes my father;--I forgot\r\nto tell you I expected him here: I will try if he knows me.\r\n\r\n_Enter OLD LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. Madam, your most obedient;--Sir, your servant.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Bows._] I find he does not know me:--Nature, be still; for now I\r\nfeel he is indeed my father.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Mr. Loveyet, I am happy to see you.\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. She would not be quite so happy, if she knew my errand.\r\n[_Aside._]--I have waited on you, madam, upon disagreeable business.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. How, sir?--I beg you will not leave me in suspense: What is it?\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. It is a matter of a delicate nature, madam, and therefore,\r\nmust not be spoken at random.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Heaven avert any unfavourable event!                [_Aside._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Mr. Loveyet, your cautious innuendoes give me sensible uneasiness.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I will withdraw, Miss Trueman;--My love--friendship, I would say,\r\nthough it wishes to afford you happiness, and participate in your troubles,\r\ndoes not presume to intrude on the private conversation Mr. Loveyet wishes.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I dare say your presence is no restraint, sir.\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. I don't know that, madam: pray, who is the gentleman?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. The gentleman is my very particular friend, sir.\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. By my body, here is rare work going on.--[_Aside._]--Well,\r\nmadam, as the gentleman is your _very particular friend_; and as his\r\n_love_--friendship, I mean, is so great, that you dare to entrust all your\r\nsecrets with him; I shall acquaint you, that, as you and my son have long\r\nentertained a partiality for each other, and being desirous to fulfill all\r\nmy engagements, as well as to make him happy, I have wrote for him to come\r\nand conclude the marriage; but, for very good reasons, I have this day\r\ndetermined to forbid the bans; and Mr. Trueman says, he is very willing\r\ntoo.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Hah!--what can all this mean?                       [_Aside._\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. You must know, madam, your father has us'd me very ill;\r\nand--to be plain with you, madam, your familiarity with this person,\r\nconvinces me you wou'd have play'd the fool with my son, without my\r\nbreaking the match. Ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. The old gentleman imagines I am going to cut myself out, it\r\nseems.                                            [_Aside to HARRIET._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You do not know who this is, sir, or you would not put any\r\nimproper constructions on the friendly freedom you have observ'd between\r\nus.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. True; and, therefore, you need not be concerned at what he\r\nsays.--Since he has made this unlucky resolution, he must not know who I\r\nam.                                               [_Aside to HARRIET._\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. How well she dissembles!--_Friendly freedom,_--a pretty term\r\nthat, for the wanton hussy. [_Aside._]--I wish Charles was here now; he\r\nwou'd acknowledge his father's kindness in preventing a match, which, I am\r\nsure, would end in sorrow and disappointment.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I doubt that much.--This parent of mine is a singular\r\ncharacter.                                        [_Aside to HARRIET._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. It is necessary you should be made acquainted with some of his\r\noddities: his most striking peculiarity is a desire to be thought younger\r\nthan he is; and, I dare say, some remark of my father, respecting his age,\r\nis the only cause of his present ill humour.\r\n\r\nOLD LOVEYET. Look how they whisper!--well, she is the most brazen coquette\r\nI ever knew!--Yes, yes, now her scandalous conduct is glaring enough.\r\n[_Aside._]--I wish you and your _very particular friend_, a good day,\r\nmadam.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I think our troubles increase fast: how unlucky, that this dispute\r\nshould happen at the very crisis of your arrival;--an event which we fondly\r\nexpected would be attended with the most pleasing circumstances.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Those fond expectations, my lovely partner in trouble, shall soon\r\nbe realized;--this is only the momentary caprice of old age.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You must take care not to talk of _age_, before him.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Yes, my fair monitor; I shall think of that: and now permit me, in\r\nmy turn, to give you a little advice.--In the first place, I would have you\r\ngo to your father--fall at his feet--clasp your fair hands,\r\nthus--beseeching him in such terms as that gentle heart is so well form'd\r\nto dictate, and persuading him with the all-prevailing music of that\r\ntuneful voice, to recall his rigourous intention, nor doom such angelic\r\ngoodness and beauty to despair, by persisting to oppose an alliance which\r\nalone can make you blest; and without which, the most faithful of lovers\r\nwill be rendered the most wretched one on earth. I shall take a similar\r\nmethod with my old gentleman, and I think I can insure myself success.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. This is all very fine; but--to have the voluntary consent of the\r\nparent one loves,--how infinitely more agreeable! I would not offend mine,\r\nfor the world: and yet--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And yet you will be obliged to offend him, by having me, eigh?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Pshaw;--how strangely you misconstrue my meaning: I was going to\r\nobserve, that I expect his obstinacy and pride will prove invincible, in\r\nspite of all the rhetoric you are pleased to ascribe to me.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Then we will employ a little rhetoric, against which another class\r\nof fathers are not quite so invincible.--Parsons are plenty, you know; and\r\nGold and Silver are persuasive little words. _Love_ inspires me with the\r\nspirit of prophecy, and tells me I shall soon with propriety call the\r\nloveliest of her sex, mine.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You are very eloquent, Mr. Loveyet: I do not think the subject\r\nmerits so many florid speeches.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Not merit them!--\r\n\r\n    _'Tis not in human language, to define\r\n    Merit so rare, and beauty--so divine!\r\n    Then what avails this little praise of mine?_\r\n\r\nHARRIET. _Harriet deserves not praise so great as thine._\r\n\r\n                                                            [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n_End of the Third Act._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I. _TRUEMAN'S House._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN [_solus_].\r\n\r\nI sincerely lament this unfortunate dispute.--I know Harriet loves that\r\nyoung fellow, though he has been so long absent; and, therefore, I regret\r\nit; for, to what end do I live but to see her happy!--But I will not give\r\nway to his father;--perhaps he may think better of the matter, for I know\r\nhim to be of a placable nature, though passionate;--and yet he seems to be\r\ninflexible in his resolution.\r\n\r\n_Enter HUMPHRY._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Sarvint, Mr. Schoolmaster;--here's a challenge for you.\r\n\r\n                                   [_Gives TRUEMAN the barber's note._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. A challenge! Surely the old blockhead would not make himself so\r\nridiculous.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, it's for that;--I remember he said you call'd him a\r\nblockhead.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You may go and tell him I advise him to relinquish his\r\nknight-errant project, or I will expose his absurdity by taking the\r\nadvantage which the law offers in such cases.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. That is, you'll take the law of him, if he goes for to fight you.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Fight me!--Oh, grovelling idea! Wit-forsaken progeny of a more\r\nthan soporific pericranium! Fight me!--Hear and be astonished, O Cicero,\r\nDemosthenes, Socrates, Plato, Seneca, Aristotle,--\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Oh, for shame!--Do you read Haristotle?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Be it known to thee, thou monstrous mass of ignorance, if such an\r\nuninformed clod, dull and heavy as that element to which it must trace its\r\norigin, can comprehend these very obvious and palpable truths, expressed in\r\nthe most plain, simple, easy, unscholastic diction.--I repeat again, that\r\nyou may apprehend me with the greater perspicuity and facility,--be it\r\nknown to thee, that those immaculate sages would have died rather than have\r\nused such an expression; by the dignity of my profession, they would:--'tis\r\ntrue that the ancients had such things as single combats among the Olympic\r\ngames, and they were always performed by the populace; but such a fight,\r\nalias a tilt, a tournament, a wrestle, could not, according to the rule of\r\nright, and the eternal fitness and aptitude of things, be properly\r\ndenominated a _bona fide_ fight; for, as I before observed, it was _ipso\r\nfacto_, a game, an Olympic game.--Olympic, from Olympus.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Pray now, Mr. Schoolmaster, if a body mought be so bold, what do\r\nyou think of the last war? Does your Schoolmastership think how that was a\r\nfona bide fight?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. You are immensely illiterate; but I will reply to your\r\ninterrogatory.--My opinion of the late war, is as follows, to\r\nwit.--_Imprimis._ The Americans were wise, brave and virtuous to struggle\r\nfor that liberty, independence and happiness, which the new government will\r\nnow render secure. _Item._ The Americans were prodigious fortunate to\r\nobtain the said liberty, independence and happiness. A war, encounter,\r\ncombat, or, if you please, fight like this, is great and glorious; it will\r\nimmortalize the name of the renowned WASHINGTON,--more than that of\r\nCincinnatus, Achilles, Æneas, Alexander the Great, Scipio, Gustavus Vasa,\r\nMark Anthony, Kouli Khan, Cæsar or Pompey.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Cæsar and Pompey! Why them is nigers' names.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. _O tempora! O mores!_\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. He talks Greek like a Trojan.--Tempora mores;--I suppose how\r\nthat's as much as to say, it was the temper of the Moors, that's the\r\nnigers, for to be call'd Cæsar and Pompey.--I guess how he can give me the\r\nexclamation of that plaguy word.--Con--let me see [_Spells it in the manner\r\nhe did before._]--Please your worshipful reverence, Mr. Schoolmaster,\r\nwhat's Latin for Constitution?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. To tell you what is Latin for Constitution, will not make you a\r\nparticle the wiser; I will, therefore, explain it in the vernacular\r\ntongue.--Constitution then, in its primary, abstract, and true\r\nsignification, is a concatenation or coacervation of simple, distinct\r\nparts, of various qualities or properties, united, compounded, or\r\nconstituted in such a manner, as to form or compose a system or body, when\r\nviewed in its aggregate or general nature. In its common, or generally\r\nreceived, acceptation, it implies two things.--First, the nature, habit,\r\ndisposition, organization or construction of the natural, corporeal, or\r\nanimal system.--Secondly, a political system, or plan of government. This\r\nlast definition, I apprehend, explains the Constitution you mean.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Like enough, but I don't understand a single word you've been a\r\ntalking about.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. No! 'Tis not my fault then:--If plainness of language, clearness\r\nof description, and a grammatical arrangement of words will not suffice, I\r\ncan do no more.\r\n\r\n_Enter OLD LOVEYET listening._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I mean the Constitution that you read in the newspapers about;\r\nthat that your worship was a going to get at loggerheads with old Mr.\r\nWhat's-his-name, about.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'll old you, you rascal!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Did you never hear your friends in the country talk of the new\r\nConstitution?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Not I, I never heard anybody talk about it, at the Pharisee's\r\nHead;--I don't believe Jeremy Stave, the clark of the meeting-house, no,\r\nnor Parson Thumpum himself ever heard of such a word--No, not even old Mr.\r\nScourge, the Schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. A hopeful genius, for a Schoolmaster, upon my education. Do you\r\nsend him to me,--I'll qualify him for that important station.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. And I'll be qualify'd I never larnt such a word when I went to his\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Nor any other one, I believe, properly speaking.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Oh yes, I'll say that for him;--he us'd to take a great deal of\r\npains for to larn us proper speaking.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. The Constitution you hear so much noise about, is a new\r\ngovernment, which some great and good men have lately contrived, and now\r\nrecommend for the welfare and happiness of the American nation.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Oh, the traitor!\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. But didn't old Mr. What's-his-name say, how they wanted for to\r\nmake slaves of us?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. There's _old_ Mr. What's-his-name, again.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Mr. Loveyet is a weak man;--you must not mind what he says.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Oh, I shall burst!\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Only think now of his sending me a challenge, because I told him\r\nhe was sixty odd years of--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Running towards them._] Death and the devil! Have I sent you a\r\nchallenge?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No, not you, old gentleman.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I'll give you _old_ gentleman.--Take that, for calling me old\r\nagain. [_Offers to strike him; but missing his blow, he falls down._] Oh,\r\nwhat an unlucky dog I am! My evil genius is certainly let loose today.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Let us coolly enquire into this enigmatical affair, Mr. Loveyet.\r\n[_Breaks open the note, and reads._] What is all this?--Booby--blockhead--\r\nsatisfaction--challenge--courage--honour--gentleman--honour'd per Monsieur\r\nCubb.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye, that's I.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. And pray, Mr. Cubb, who gave you this pretty epistle?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, mounsieur, the barber.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. By the dignity of my profession, it must be so:--Now there's a\r\nsolution to the enigma.--Mr. Loveyet, you will excuse my mistaking this\r\nbusiness so much;--the paltry Frisieur never enter'd my head;--you\r\nrecollect I gave him a little flagellation this morning.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Yes, and I recollect the occasion too;--this confounded upstart\r\nConstitution (that cause of all my crosses and troubles) is at the bottom\r\nof every mischief.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Yes, your wou'd-be Constitution, has indeed done a deal of\r\nmischief.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I deny it;--it is perfectly inoffensive and mild.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Mild, indeed:--happy would it be for America, if her government\r\nwas more coercive and energetic!--I suppose you have heard that\r\nMassachusetts has ratified this upstart Constitution;--this is the sixth\r\ngrand column in the federal edifice; we only want three more to make up\r\nthe lucky nine; and then the nine Muses will make our western world their\r\npermanent abode; and _he_ who is at once their Favourite and Patron, will\r\npreside over the whole: then we shall see another Golden Age; arts will\r\nthen flourish, and literature be properly encouraged. That's the grand\r\n_desideratum_ of _my_ wishes.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. A fig for your Latin and your literature!--That's the way your\r\nunconstitutional Constitutionalists take the advantage of our weak side,\r\nand--\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. And the said weak side being easily discovered, as you have but\r\none side,--go on, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And cram their unconstitutional bolus down our throats, with\r\nLatin;--you and your vile junto of perfidious politicians want to _Latin_\r\nus out of our liberties.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Well, why don't they take the law of the pollikitchens then, eigh?\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Mr. Loveyet, I never knew a man of your age and wisdom--\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Age, sir!--Wisdom!--Yes, wisdom, sir.--Age again, eigh? Ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Was there ever such preposterous behaviour!--You are getting as\r\ncrazy as your favorite Constitution.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. You are crazier than either, you old blockhead, or you would not\r\nmake such a crazy speech: I say my constitution is a thousand per cent.\r\nbetter than yours. Ugh, ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. A pretty figure for a good constitution! What a striking instance\r\nof health, youth, and beauty! How emblematically grotesque! The very image\r\nof deformity and infirmity! A perfect mirror for Milton's description of\r\nSin and Death.\r\n\r\n    _Not Yorick's skull, nor Hamlet's ghost,\r\n    Nor all the tragic, stage-made host;\r\n    With saucer eyes, and looks aghast,\r\n    Would make me run away so fast:\r\n    Not all who Milton's head inspire,--\r\n    \"Gorgons and Hydras and Chimæras dire!\"\r\n    Nor haggard Death, nor snake-torn Sin,\r\n    Look half so ugly, old and thin;\r\n    No--all his hell-born, monstrous crew,\r\n    Are not so dire a sight as you!_\r\n\r\n[_While TRUEMAN is saying this, LOVEYET appears to be in a violent\r\n  rage, and makes several attempts to interrupt the former, who shuns\r\n  LOVEYET, as if afraid._]\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Fire and murder!--Must I bear to be held up for such a monster?\r\nPerdition!--What shall I do? What shall I say?--Oh! oh! oh!--Oh!\r\nliberty! Oh, my country! Look how he ridicules me!--Did ever any poor\r\nman suffer so much for the good of his country!--But I won't give up the\r\nglorious cause yet;--sir,--Mr. Trueman--I insist upon it, the new\r\nConstitution, sir,--I say, that the old--the new--that--that--'Zounds\r\nand fury!--\r\n\r\n          [_Running towards him, and making an attempt to strike him._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. My dear Mr. Loveyet, compose yourself a little;--for heaven's\r\nsake, sir, consider;--your animal Constitution is not able to withstand the\r\nformidable opposition of my political one;--the shock is too great;--let me\r\npersuade you, sir; and as soon as nine States accede to the adoption of the\r\nnew Constitution, we will investigate the merits of the old. Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\n[_This speech and the preceding one, are to be spoken at the same time;\r\n  during which, TRUEMAN and LOVEYET run about the stage, and HUMPHRY\r\n  retreats from them as they approach him._]\r\n\r\n_Enter HARRIET alarmed._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Oh, Papa,--my dear Papa, what's the matter!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And, sir, as sure as--as--eight times nine is sixty-three, your\r\nnew government is not bottom, not sound; and--\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. And as sure as you are sixty-three, your head is not sound.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Here is your incomparable daughter;--I came here to acquaint you\r\nof her scandalous conduct; but now she can save me that trouble.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. How, sir! My daughter's scandalous conduct?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I was going to tell you. I caught her with a strange gallant,--a\r\n\"very particular friend;\" whose \"love,--friendship, I would say,\" was so\r\nsincere, that she was kind enough to grant him a little \"friendly freedom,\"\r\nin my presence.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Heaven protect me! There certainly must be something in this.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And that I have received a letter from my son.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye, now he's his son again.                        [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And that he will be here soon, and that when he comes, I am going\r\nto marry him to Miss Maria Airy.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I must go tell Mr. Lovit of that, at once.\r\n                                                   [_Aside, and exit._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And--but it is no matter now:--I suppose she will tell you a fine\r\nstory of a cock and a bull.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I shall not be base enough to deceive a father, I give you my\r\nhonour, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I am very much mistaken if you have not given _that_ to somebody\r\nalready:--A woman's honour is a very perishable commodity; a little thing\r\noften spoils it.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. By what a feeble tenure does poor woman hold her character and\r\npeace of mind!--It is true, sir, that a woman's _reputation_ is too\r\nfrequently, with ruffian cruelty, blasted in the bud, without a cause; and\r\nthat so effectually, that it seldom or never flourishes again; but let me\r\nremind you, sir, in the words of the poet, that--\r\n\r\n    _\"Honour's a sacred tie, the law of kings;--\r\n    It ought not to be sported with.\"_\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I say it ought to be sported with; and, by my body, 'tis capital\r\nsport, too;--eigh, Horace?--[_Sings._]--\"Then hoity toity, whisky frisky,\r\n&c.\"\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. A truce to your insipid, hard-labour'd wit: the honour you are\r\npleased to call in question, is not an empty name which can be purchased\r\nwith gold; it is too inestimable to be counterpoised by that imaginary\r\ngood; otherwise the titles of Honourable and Excellent would be always\r\nsignificant of his Honour's or his Excellency's intrinsic worth;--a thing\r\n\"devoutly to be wish'd,\" but unfortunately too seldom exemplified; for, as\r\nthe dramatic muse elegantly says of money,--\"Who steals my purse, steals\r\ntrash.\"\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I deny it;--the dramatic muse, as you call him, was a fool:--trash\r\nindeed! Ha, ha, ha. Money trash! Ready Rhino trash! Golden, glittering,\r\njingling money!--I'm sure he cou'dn't mean the hard stuff.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Very sublime conceptions, upon my erudition; and expressed by some\r\ntruly elegant epithets; but your ideas, like your conscience, are of the\r\nfashionable, elastic kind;--self-interest can stretch them like\r\nIndian-rubber.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What a stupid old gudgeon!--Well, you'll believe what I tell you,\r\nsooner or later, Mr. Schoolmaster; so your servant:--as for you, Miss\r\nHypocrite, I wish your Honour farewell, and I guess you may do the same.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. These insinuations, Harriet, have put my anxiety to the rack.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I am happy I can so soon relieve you from it, sir. Young Mr.\r\nLoveyet arrived this morning; but, it seems, the old gentleman has entirely\r\nforgot him, during his long absence; and when he heard his father's\r\nresolution, in consequence of the dispute he had with you, he did not think\r\nproper to make himself known. It was this which made him think me so\r\nculpable, that you hear he talks of marrying him to my friend Maria.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I see into the mistake; but the worst construction the affair will\r\nadmit, does not justify his using you so indecently; and, if it were not\r\nfor the more powerful consideration of a daughter's happiness, I would make\r\nhim repent it.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I have ever found my honoured, my only parent both wise in\r\nconcerting plans for that daughter's happiness, and good in executing them\r\nto the utmost of his ability; and, I dare say, he does not think her\r\nalliance with Mr. Loveyet's son will prove unfavourable to her happiness.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Far from it, my child:--Your unusual good sense makes a\r\ncommon-place lecture unnecessary, Harriet; but beware of flattery and\r\ndissimulation; for the manners of the present age are so dissolute, that\r\nthe young fellows of these degenerate days think they cannot be fine\r\ngentlemen without being rakes, and--in short, rascals; for they make a\r\nmerit even of debauching innocence:--indeed, that is scarcely to be\r\nwondered at, when so many of those who are called ladies of taste and\r\nfashion, strange as it may seem, like them the better for it;--but I hope,\r\nyou and Mr. Loveyet are exceptions to such depravity.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I think I can venture to assure you, we _are_, sir;--and now, if\r\nmy father has nothing more to impart, I will take my leave of him; and be\r\nassured, sir, your advice shall be treasured here, as a sacred pledge of\r\npaternal love.--Adieu, Papa.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Farewell, Harriet;--Heaven prosper your designs.\r\n\r\n                                                  [_Exeunt severally._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II. _A Street._\r\n\r\n_Enter HUMPHRY and WORTHNOUGHT meeting._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT.

No, you look more like a dancing-master, a fighting-master, or a\r\nplay-actor, or some such flashy folks; but looks is nothing, for everybody\r\ndresses alike nowadays; like master, like man, as the old saying is; ecod,\r\nyou can't tell a Congressman from a marchant's 'prentice, everybody dresses\r\nso fine.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Ha, ha, ha,--he is pasitively a very eccentric bady, and there\r\nis a small tincture of a barbarous sart of wit in what he says; but it\r\nwants an immensity of correction, an infinitude of polishing; he is a mere\r\nson of nature, everything he says is express'd in such a Gathic, uncouth,\r\nAnti-Chesterfieldian style; and as for his dress, it is pasitively most\r\nprepasterously clownish and original.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why he talks as many long-winded, old-fashioned words, as the\r\nSchoolmaster.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Mr.--Mr.--Pray what is your proper name, besides Humphry? Your\r\nsirname, I mean.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. My proper sirname is Humphry Cubb; why our family is the most\r\nlargest family within the circumroundibus of fifty miles, and the most\r\ngrandest too, tho' I say it that shou'dn't say it; for my father's\r\nfather's great-grandfather was a just-ass of the peace, when King George\r\nthe third was a sucking baby, and, therefore, as father says, a greater\r\n_man_ then, than he was, ha, ha, ha. And his great aunt, by his mother's\r\nside, had the honour to be chief waiting woman to Mynheer Van\r\nHardsprakencrampdejawmetlongname, the Dutch governor's public\r\nscratchetary; but I needn't go so far back neither, for I've got, at\r\nthis present time, no less than two second cousins; one of 'em is\r\nsoup-provider for the county, and t'other belongs to the liglislature,\r\nand both belonging to our family too;--both Cubbs.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Yes, the world abounds with Cubbs, just such unlick'd ones as\r\nyou are;--there is a profusion of them in this city.--You must know, _I_\r\nam Dick Worthnought, esquire; a gentleman, a buck of the blood, and a--you\r\nunderstand me.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, your family must be as big as mine, then; for I've seen\r\nhundreds of such Worth-nothing bloody bucks as you, since I've been in\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Your criticisms are perfectly barbarous and disagreeable,\r\n'foregad; but,--will you let me know what you and the West-India young\r\ngentleman were whispering about, at Miss Trueman's?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes.--You can have Miss Trueman now, if you've a mind.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Can I? Only prove your words, and enroll me your everlasting,\r\nyour indissoluble friend, demme.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Friend me none of your friends; I don't want such everlasting\r\nfriends as you, d'ye see, becase why, if you never make a beginning with\r\nyour friendship, I'm sure it can't be everlasting; and if you've got a mind\r\nto shew your friendliness, I'm sure you cou'dn't have a more fitter time\r\nthan now.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. What wou'd the addity have me say, I wonder.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. I wou'dn't have you say anything,--you talk too much already, for\r\nthe matter o' that; I like for to see people do things, not talk 'em.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. There [_Gives him money._]--is that what you want?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye, I thought you understood me well enough.--Your friendship\r\nwants as much spurring and kicking and coaxing as our lazy old gelding at\r\nhome;--I wou'dn't trust such a friend as far as I cou'd fling a cow by the\r\ntail.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Poh, poh,--to the point, to the point.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, then you must know, how old Mr. Lovit is a going for to marry\r\nthe West-Indian young gentleman to young Mistress Airy, I think he call'd\r\nher; and so you can go try Mistress Harriet yourself, for I'm sure she\r\nwon't have him now.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Why, pray?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why if she gets him, she'll get a bastard, for old Mr. Lovit isn't\r\nhis father.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. No?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No;--and then he and the Schoolmaster kick'd up a proper rumpus\r\nabout a challenge I fetch'd him; and that's all the news you'll get for\r\nyour money.--A poor shilling that won't buy ale to my oysters to-night.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT [_manet_].\r\n\r\nThis is a lucky meeting, 'foregad;--I'll go immediately and report, that\r\nyoung Loveyet has of late seen my quondam charmer carry a copy of him in\r\nminiature about her, which (strange to tell) is continually growing nearer\r\nto the life; and that he refuses to have her, on that account.--\"If she\r\ngets him, she will get a bastard.\"--By which I choose to\r\nunderstand,--matters have gone so far, that she cannot save herself from\r\nthat disgrace, even if she marries him.--Now, in order that this tale of\r\nmine may transpire briskly, I must first see some of my tattling female\r\nfriends;--they will set it a going like wild-fire.--Split me, but it is an\r\nexcellent thought;--ha, ha, ha. Poor Loveyet.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III. _HERALD'S House._\r\n\r\n_Enter CANTWELL and HERALD._\r\n\r\nCANTWELL.

Nothing strange, Miss Tabitha; I am as barren of anything new, as\r\nan old Almanack.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Oh shocking!--\"as barren of anything new.\"--What an odious\r\nexpression!--The most vulgarest comparison in nature.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Umph.--I suppose, if Mr. Gracely was here, you would not be so much\r\nin the dumps.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Ah, Miss Herald!--If you felt the corruptions of your wicked\r\nheart, you would be in the dumps too, as you call it.\r\n\r\n                                                             [_Sighs._\r\n\r\nHERALD. I believe there is a certain corruption in your heart, which our\r\nsex are apt to feel very sensibly, and that is the want of a husband.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. The want of a husband!--I vow, you are monstrous indelicate, Miss\r\nHerald; I am afraid you are wandering from the paths of vartue, as dear\r\ngood Mr. Gracely says.\r\n\r\nHERALD. There comes his very reverse,--Mr. Worthnought.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Ah, he is a profane rake; he is lighter than vanity, as Mr.\r\nGracely says;--a mere painted sepulchre.\r\n\r\nHERALD. That ancient sepulchre of yours is pretty much daub'd, I think.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\n_Enter WORTHNOUGHT._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT.

[_Aside._]--Have you heard the news, respecting Miss Harriet\r\nTrueman, ladies?\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Yes, now I think on 't, there is a report about town, that old\r\nMr. Loveyet saw her and another rather familiar together.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Oh, you have not heard half, madam.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Do, let us hear, Mr. Worthnought.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Aye, do; but do not say anything that will hurt Miss Tabitha's\r\ndelicacy; for, before you came in, I was complaining that I was _barren_ of\r\nanything new, and she was almost ready to swoon at the expression.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. If Miss Tabitha has such an antipathy to barrenness, she will\r\nnot be offended at my subject, which is a very prolific one, I assure you;\r\nfor Miss Trueman is on the verge of _bearing_ a son.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Oh, horrid! What will this wicked world come to at last!--A\r\ngood-for-nothing, wanton hussy.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Very true, madam:--by persons of easy notions of virtue,\r\nindeed, it would be considered a trifling _faux pas_, as the French call\r\nit; a perfect _bagatelle_; or, at most, a superficial act of incontinency;\r\nbut to those who have such rigid notions of virtue as Miss Cantwell, for\r\nexample, or Miss Herald, or their humble servant; it appears quite another\r\nthing, quite another thing, ladies:--though it is one of my foibles;--I own\r\nit is a fault to be so intalerably nice about the affairs of women; but it\r\nis a laudable imperfection, if I may be allowed the phrase;--it is erring\r\non the safe side, for women's affairs are delicate things to meddle with,\r\nladies.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. You are perfectly in the right, Mr. Worthnought, but one can't\r\nhelp speaking up for the honour of one's sex, you know.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Very true, madam:--to make the matter still worse, ladies, Mr.\r\nLoveyet is just arrived from abroad to be married to her; and the old\r\ngentleman is going to ally him immediately to Miss Maria Airy in\r\nconsequence of it.\r\n\r\nHERALD. I am glad of that, however;--I will forgive Miss Trueman her\r\nfailing, if that is the case, for then I shall have a better chance to\r\ngain Frankton.

You are positively the greatest lady's man, Mr. Worthnought,--\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. I am proud of your compliment, madam; and I wish Miss Tabitha\r\ncould consider me such, from her own experience; it would be conferring the\r\nhighest hanor on her slave, 'pan hanor.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Oh, sir,--your politeness quite confuses me.   [_Curtsying._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Miss Herald, your thrice devoted.--_Mademoiselle, je suis\r\nvotre Serviteur très humble._\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Mr. Worthnought, your servant.--[_Exit WORTHNOUGHT._]--Don't you\r\nthink he is a very pretty fellow, Miss Herald?--He's the very pattern of\r\ntrue politeness; his address is so winning and agreeable,--and then, he\r\ntalks French, with the greatest felicity imaginable.\r\n\r\nHERALD. I cannot say I see many perfections in him; but you talk'd very\r\ndifferently just now;--Mr. Worthnought then was lighter than vanity; and\r\nnow, it seems, he has more weight with you, than good Mr. Gracely.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. You are only mortify'd that Mr. Worthnought took so little notice\r\nof you, ma'am; you see he prefers me to you, though you value yourself so\r\nmuch upon being a little young, ma'am; you see men of sense don't mind a\r\nfew years, ma'am; so your servant, ma'am.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nHERALD [_manet_].\r\n\r\nWhat a vain old fool!

You really have, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Oh, yes, I recollect now;--you are the person who have supplanted\r\nmy son.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Indeed, sir, I am not that person.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. How!--Was you not with Harriet Trueman, this morning?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Yes, sir; but I have no intention to supplant your son, I assure\r\nyou; on the contrary, it is the supreme wish of my heart, that his love may\r\nbe rewarded with so rich a treasure as the amiable Harriet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. He shall be rewarded with a much richer one, if he is wise enough\r\nto think so.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. If it be wisdom to prefer another to Harriet, then may I ever\r\nremain a fool!                                               [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET.

What a paradoxical fellow this is! [_Aside._]--Did not you this\r\nminute say, you did not intend to have her?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. I did not, sir; I mean to have her if possible, and that without\r\ndisappointing your son; but I shall explain myself better, by telling you\r\nwho I am. Look at me well, sir--did you never see such a face before?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I hope I am not talking to a lunatic! [_Aside._]--Yes, I saw you\r\nthis morning.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Did you never see me before that, sir?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Looks at him steadfastly._] Yes,--I'm sure I have; and I'm very\r\nmuch mistaken, if--yes, that reconciles all his strange conduct;--it must\r\nbe so;--it is Charles himself.\r\n\r\nCHARLES.

I wish you would take me in the matrimonial way, sir;--that would\r\nbe a most agreeable take in.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Well, well, we shall not disagree about that:--I am very happy\r\nthis affair clears up Harriet's conduct so well; she is a fine girl, that's\r\ncertain; and, if you love her as much as you formerly did, why--I don't\r\nknow what I may not do.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Oh, sir, you make me unspeakably happy! If my Love is to be the\r\ncondition of the welcome Bond, I do not care if it is executed to-morrow;\r\nfor, were the penalty an age of love, I am sure I could pay it.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By my body, I'll have a wedding soon, and a merry one too:--I'll\r\ngo and make it up with old Trueman;--but then he must not talk of the\r\nConstitution.--That's true, Charles, what government are you for,\r\neigh?--The old or the new?\r\n\r\nCHARLES.

Why, I'm not old enough for your father,\r\nyou great whelp you:--Ungracious young bastard,--to have the assurance to\r\nridicule his father!--Out of my house, you 'scape-grace!\r\n\r\nCHARLES.

I have beheld their beauty with equal pleasure and astonishment;\r\nand the understanding, the affability, and vivacity, by which strangers,\r\nwith so much propriety, characterize my fair countrywomen, give them a\r\npre-eminence over the ladies of most other countries, that is highly\r\ngratifying to a mind already so much attached to its native city, by the\r\nmost endearing of all human ties;--they are all that the warmest, the most\r\nluxuriant fancy can wish; beautiful--almost beyond the possibility of an\r\nincrease of charms; and--I had almost said, they furnish room for love and\r\nwarm conceptions, \"even to madness!\"\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I am in doubt no longer;--such passionate expressions must have\r\nLove for their prompter.                                     [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. My friend Frankton extolled them highly; but his description\r\nderogates from their desert;--you, too, he praised;--I listened to\r\nhim--with unspeakable delight, and believed him with all the ardour of\r\nfaith and expectation; for I could readily believe that, which I had so\r\noften, so sweetly experienced;--but when you last blest my eyes with that\r\nenchanting form, how was the idea exceeded by the reality!--To do justice\r\nto _such_ perfection, the praises I this minute bestowed on the ladies I\r\nhave seen, would be spiritless and insufficient!--To charms like Miss\r\nHarriet's, what hermit could remain insensible!--_I_ was not\r\ninsensible;--the tender passion, I began so early to entertain; a passion,\r\nwhich length of absence, and a succession of objects and events, had\r\nrendered too dormant, was then excited to sensations the most exquisitely\r\nsensible;--was then taught to glow with a flame, too fervent to be now\r\nsuppressed!\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Were I but sure of his sincerity!                   [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. With what indifference she hears me!--If she is so insensible to\r\nthe genuine effusions of a heart like mine, I am lost indeed! But I will\r\ntry a little deception to discover the truth. [_Aside._]--What a lovely\r\npicture Mr. Frankton drew of Miss Airy! But it was not too highly finished;\r\nfor a thousand Loves and Graces have conspired, to make her the most\r\naccomplished of her sex.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. My pride shall not let him triumph over my chagrin. [_Aside._]--I\r\nknow Miss Airy to be as accomplished as you represent her, sir: and Mr.\r\nFrankton gave such a lovely description of her, you say;--I dare say he\r\ndid;--oh,--yes--yes [_Appears disconcerted, by striving to hide her\r\nconcern._]--he loves her to distraction;--Mr. Frankton has doubtless made a\r\nwise choice.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By all that's false, she is concerned at Frankton's having\r\npraised his mistress! She absolutely loves him!              [_Aside._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. And you have seen the amiable Miss Airy, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Forgive me, honour and veracity. [_Aside._]--Yes, Miss Trueman;\r\nand not without a deep sense of her uncommon worth and beauty.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I admire your discernment, sir;--Mr. Frankton, too, is a very nice\r\njudge of female merit; and he cannot evince his judgment better, than by\r\npraising my friend Maria.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Pardon me, madam: with submission to your friend's merit, I think\r\nhis panegyric would better apply to you.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. That compliment is too great, to be meant, I fancy.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I rather think, you value the author of it so little, that you\r\nwould as soon he should withhold it, madam.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Certainly, sir, when I have reason to think there is another who\r\nhas a better right to it, and for whom it is secretly intended.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. You wrong me much, madam:--some tattling gossip or designing\r\nknave, has whispered some falsehood to my prejudice;--probably my\r\n_rival_,--Mr. Worthnought.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. If you have come here with a design to use me ill, sir, I beg you\r\nwill tell me so, and then I shall act accordingly.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Your actions accord very illy with your _professions_, I think,\r\nmadam.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. _Your_ duplicity, sir, both in word and action, justifies my\r\nretorting that ungenerous accusation.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I entreat you to believe me, Miss Harriet, when I say, I am\r\nunconscious of having done anything I ought to be ashamed of, since my\r\narrival: I am so confident of this, that the circulation of a malicious\r\nrumour, however dishonourable to me, would give me little disquiet, did I\r\nnot reflect, that it is the object of Harriet's credulity;--a reflection,\r\nthat is the source of real unhappiness to me:--be kind then, Harriet, and\r\ntell me wherein I am guilty;--obscurity in a matter so interesting, gives\r\nmore torture to the mind, than the most unwelcome truth.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. He must be sincere. [_Aside._]--Your request shall be comply'd\r\nwith, sir.--The principal offence you are charged with, is your having been\r\nsmitten by the lady, on whom you have bestowed such liberal\r\ncommendation;--be that as it may, I heard Mr. Loveyet talk of such a\r\nmatch:--I believe it will require a more able advocate than yourself, to\r\ndefend _this_ cause.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Suppose I assure you, on the sacred honour of a gentleman, that\r\nwhat you have heard is false;--suppose I add the more important sanction of\r\nan oath, to seal the truth.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I will save you that trouble:--you have an advocate _here_, which\r\nhas already gained your cause.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Oh, Harriet, you are too good!--Conscious as I am of the rectitude\r\nof my conduct, as it respects my Harriet;--sure as I am of not deserving\r\nyour displeasure, I still feel myself unworthy of such matchless goodness.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You say too much; and compel me to tell you that you merit my\r\nhighest esteem.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Esteem! What a cold epithet!--And am not I entitled to something\r\nmore than _esteem_?\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Excuse the poverty of the expression; and be assured, my heart\r\ndictated a more exalted word;--let this confession atone for the fault.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And yet I would fain attract your esteem too; for, I have heard\r\nconnoisseurs in the science of Love say, it is possible to _love_ an\r\nobject, and that to distraction, without having a particle of _esteem_ for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I have assured you that _my_ esteem is at least equalled by a more\r\npassionate affection:--but how strangely you talk!--First you acknowledge\r\nyourself unworthy of my favour;--then you are alarmed that I should only\r\nesteem you; and when I talk of a passion, superior to mere _Platonic_ love,\r\nyou are afraid, on the other hand, it is a blind, enthusiastic impulse, not\r\nfounded on _esteem_.--How inconsistent are lovers!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Your reasoning, like your person, surprises, charms and\r\nsubdues:--I will be more consistent;--but our contention is only for\r\npre-eminence in love;--delightful emulation! Agreeable inconsistency!\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I am now ashamed of my childish suspicions; but I should not have\r\nbeen so credulous, had it not been for an affection, which rendered my\r\nbetter judgment blind to the fallacy, and made me more apprehensive of your\r\ninconstancy, than satisfied of your innocence; and this disposed me to\r\nmisinterpret every thing you said.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And your apparent indifference, in consequence of that\r\nmisinterpretation, excited similar suspicions in me; and thus, mutual\r\ndistrust produced mutual misapprehension.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. But you have not told me the particulars of your interview with\r\nold Mr. Loveyet.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Were you to hear those particulars, they would only afford you\r\npain;--'tis sufficient for me to tell you, he has turned me out of his\r\nhouse, only because I told him, I was a friend to the new Constitution,\r\nforsooth.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. He is a strange character:--when I call'd on my father, I was\r\nalarmed to find them at high words;--and he abus'd _me_ most unmercifully.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. He did? 'Tis well for him he has call'd himself my father;--but if\r\nmy Harriet consents, I will immediately put myself in a situation that will\r\njustify my preventing his future ill usage:--Fortune has enabled me to act\r\nindependent either of his frown or his favour;--I have taken such measures,\r\nin consequence of his base usage, as will guard us against the effects of\r\nthe one, without obliging us to cringe for the other.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. I am happy to hear it; but affluence is not my object, nor poverty\r\nmy dread; and I am happy I can convince you how little I desire an alliance\r\nfor interest, by now tendering you the whole of my trifling fortune, in\r\ncase your father should deprive you of yours.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Charming Harriet! Miracle of disinterested love! Thus let me\r\nevince my gratitude.\r\n\r\n                                       [_Kneels, and kisses her hand._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Pray do not worship me, Mr. Loveyet; I am less generous than you\r\nimagine;--self-love is at the bottom of this noble declaration; for if I\r\ndid not suppose you capable of making me happier than any other man, I\r\nwould keep both my fortune and my person, to myself.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Better and better!--Your explanation gives me new reason to adore\r\nsuch uncommon worth, and makes me blest beyond measure! By heaven, New-York\r\ndoes not contain such a fortunate fellow!\r\n\r\n_Enter FRANKTON._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. [_Seeing FRANKTON._]--Ha, ha. You could not say more, if you were\r\naddressing my friend Maria.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Talk not of your friend Maria,--\r\n\r\nHARRIET. You talked enough of her perfections just now, for both of us.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. He did, eigh?                                      [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I spoke of her as I thought she deserv'd; she is a lovely\r\ncreature, but--but [_Sees FRANKTON._]--Frankton!\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I hope Miss Trueman will excuse my coming in so abruptly:--I have\r\nbeen looking for Mr. Loveyet, all over the city; at last I concluded, I\r\nmight find him here.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Really sir; and pray, what made you conclude so?\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I thought it was within the compass of probability, madam.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Perhaps it was the lady you wanted to see so much, Frankton;--that\r\n_she_ might be here, was certainly within the compass of probability.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Had I then known what I have discovered since, I should have\r\nlooked for you at some place not very distant from the lady, whose\r\nperfections you have been contemplating with so much admiration; for by\r\nMiss Harriet's account, you have seen her, perhaps, more than once.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I saw her yesterday, and was charmed with her beauty.--Whenever\r\nI am betrayed into one falsehood, I am obliged to support it with twenty\r\nmore.                                                        [_Aside._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. It is really so, sir;--he was enraptured with her idea just\r\nnow.--I fear your friend is your rival, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And I fear my friend is my rival, madam.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Nay, what cause have you for _such_ a fear?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. About as good as you have, my dear.--I am glad you came in when\r\nyou did, Frankton; for you must know, we have had certain mutual doubts and\r\njealousies; in consequence of which, a little ill-natured altercation,\r\notherwise called love, ensued: a small foretaste of conjugal felicity; but\r\nthe short-liv'd storm soon subsided, and a reconciliation made all calm\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I have something to say to you in private, Loveyet. [_Aside to\r\nLOVEYET._]--I am sorry to deprive you of Mr. Loveyet's company, madam; but\r\nI trust you will excuse me, when I tell you I have particular business with\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHARRIET. By all means, sir.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Your most obedient, madam.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Goes up to HARRIET._]--Adieu;--expect me soon, and be assured of\r\nmy unalterable fidelity.\r\n\r\n                                                [_Exit with FRANKTON._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. Farewell.--I wish he had look'd for you a little farther, before\r\nhe had taken you away.--There are so many captivating objects in the city\r\n(as he has already seen and declared), and dissipation abounds so much\r\namong us, that who knows, if he is now sincere, how long he will remain\r\nso;--and how long after marriage:--\"Ah, there's the rub.\"--Well, matrimony\r\nwill put his constancy to the test, that's one comfort;--it is a hazardous\r\nexpedient, but it is a certain one.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III. _A Street._\r\n\r\n_Enter FRANKTON and YOUNG LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. He denounces perpetual enmity against me; threatens me with\r\nbeggary, and (what is worse) resolves to prevent my union with Harriet, and\r\nthus blast all my hopes; but I shall take care to disappoint his views;--I\r\nhave just sent the most valuable part of my property to--\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Hah! There goes Miss Airy, I believe:--pray excuse me, Charles;\r\nperhaps she has observed me. You have eased my mind of its doubts, and your\r\nresolution has made your friend happy.--Adieu.\r\n\r\n                                                     [_Exit in haste._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET [_manet_].\r\n\r\nA plague take your hurry, I say:--In the very moment of my telling him\r\nabout sending the money to his house, he must conceit he saw Miss\r\nAiry;--but he has not received it yet, or he would have told me.--I hope\r\nHumphry has made no mistake;--I must see about it immediately.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE IV. _The Street before MARIA'S House._\r\n\r\n_Enter HUMPHRY and NEGRO with a trunk._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. This here is the house, I warrant you;--these crooked figures is\r\nenough for to puzzle a lawyer.--He said number two hundred and\r\ntwenty-one:--two two's and a one stands for that, and there it is.\r\n[_Knocks,--SERVANT comes out._] Does one Mr. Frankton live here, pray?\r\n\r\nSERVANT. No;--he is here pretty often though, and I expect he will live\r\nhere altogether, by and by.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye, I suppose he's only a lodger;--yes, this must be the place.\r\n\r\nSERVANT. 'Tis not the place you want, I believe.--Mr. Airy lives here.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Mr. Airy! Aye, aye, now I've got it.--Here, Mr. What-d'ye-call'um,\r\nwill you please to tell Miss Mary, somebody wants for to speak to her.\r\n[_Exit SERVANT._] Now I've found out the mistake;--since I told him how the\r\nold man was a going for to marry him to Miss Mary, he thought he must obey\r\nthe old fellow, for fear he shou'dn't let him have any of his money, and\r\nshe's got a swinging fortune, they say; so he sent the trunk to her.--But\r\nwhat shou'd he tell me to take it to Mr. Frankton's for?--Why I suppose he\r\nthought I should find him here, for the man says he's here very often:--and\r\nthen the number on the door; why, that settles the matter at once,--there\r\ncan't be two numbers alike, in the same street, sartainly:--Yes, he's made\r\none of his old blunders.\r\n\r\n_SERVANT returns._\r\n\r\nSERVANT. Please to walk in, sir.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye, aye;--here, master Cuffy, this way.\r\n\r\n                                                        [_They go in._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE V. _A Room in MARIA'S House._\r\n\r\n_MARIA and OLD LOVEYET discovered sitting._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. It certainly is a mistake, madam; I have sent nothing out of my\r\nhouse to-day.\r\n\r\nMARIA. He said it was from Mr. Loveyet, sir.--I confess I could not\r\nconceive what could induce you to send me a trunk of money.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Who brought it, madam?\r\n\r\nMARIA. A clownish kind of person, sir,--a countryman, I believe.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Ah, now I begin to suspect something.--What a sad rascal!--want\r\nto cheat his father! But this lucky mistake will spoil his project.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nMARIA. You are striving to unravel the mystery, sir.--I am afraid the man\r\nhas made some serious mistake.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. No matter,--it could not have come to a more suitable place; for,\r\nnow it is here, it shall be yours, if you will consent to a proposal I have\r\nto make to you; for I have discovered it to be my property, after all.\r\n\r\nMARIA. If I can with propriety consent to anything you may propose, I will,\r\nsir;--but I hope you do not think either your or your son's _money_ will\r\ntempt me.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. No, madam,--that is to say, I dare say it will not tempt you to\r\ndo anything that is wrong;--but money is a tempting thing too,--though\r\nnot quite so tempting as Miss Maria.--Hem, hem.--There was a delicate\r\ncompliment for her!                                          [_Aside._\r\n\r\nMARIA. Mercy on me! What can the ugly old mortal mean! It cannot be\r\npossible he would have the vanity to propose his odious self.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. You must know, madam, my son has lately arrived from the\r\nWest-Indies--\r\n\r\nMARIA. Really?--You rejoice me, sir.--Happy, happy Harriet!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Not so happy as you imagine, madam; for she is not to have my son,\r\nI assure you; I intend a lady of greater beauty and merit for him, who is\r\nnot very far from me now,--provided she and her father have no\r\nobjection.--There I put it home to her [_Aside._]. Ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nMARIA. I fear there is something in this rumour about Harriet.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Come, shall it be so, eigh?--Well, silence gives consent.--I know\r\nyou can't have any particular objection. I must have you for a--Ugh, ugh,\r\nuh.\r\n\r\nMARIA. I must humour this joke a little. [_Aside._]--The honour you wish to\r\nconfer on me, is so great, Mr. Loveyet, that I want words to express a\r\nsuitable acknowledgment;--but what will the world say, when a gentleman of\r\nMr. Loveyet's sedateness and experience stoops to a giddy girl like me?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By my body, she thinks I want to have her myself.--Why, what a\r\nlucky young dog I am! I wish old Trueman was here now;--'ods my heart, and\r\nmy life, and my--ugh, ugh,--but I must talk the matter over coolly with\r\nher. Hem, hem. [_Aside._]--Oh, you dear little charming, angelic\r\ncreature;--I love you so much, I cou'd find in my heart to--'Zounds! I\r\ncou'd eat you up.--By my body, but you must give me a sweet kiss. [_Offers\r\nto kiss her._] 'Sblood! I can't bear it any longer. [_Snatches a\r\nkiss._]--Ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nMARIA. What a preposterous old dotard! [_Aside._]--You will excuse me, Mr.\r\nLoveyet; I have company waiting for me.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By all means, my blossom;--it goes to my very heart to part with\r\nyou, though;--but go to your company, my love, go, go.--I wou'dn't\r\ndisoblige you, nor put the least thing in your way, for the seraglio--of\r\nthe Grand Seignior. You may give up the trunk to my son now, if he calls\r\nfor it, my love. [_Exit MARIA._] Oh, what a dear creature! Such sweet\r\nlips,--such panting, precious, plump, little--oh, I cou'd jump out of my\r\nskin at the thoughts of it!--By my body, I must have her, and poor Charles\r\nmay have Harriet, for all.--A fig for both the Constitutions now, I say; I\r\nwou'dn't give my dear little Maria for a score of them.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE VI. _A Street._\r\n\r\n_Enter YOUNG LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nI wish I could find that fellow;--I cannot think he has been\r\ntreacherous;--but it is very strange, neither he nor my man have returned\r\nyet:--I am tired of seeking Frankton too;--since he made free to call at\r\nHarriet's for me, I think I will go to Miss Airy's for him: they say she\r\nlives near by. [_Enter HUMPHRY._]--Well, sir, what have you done with the\r\ntrunk?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Why, what you told me, to be sure. I've been a making your man\r\nCuffy drunk, with some of the money you give me; but he's 'most sober now.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Did you see Mr. Frankton?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. No; but I carried the trunk to his lodgings though: I was just a\r\ngoing to Mr. Airy's, to see if I cou'dn't find you there.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Mr. Airy's?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Aye,--where Mr. Frankton lodges; number two hundred and\r\ntwenty-one;--there it is before your eyes.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. That is number one hundred and twenty-two;--you did not carry it\r\nthere, I hope.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes I did.--Why isn't that the place?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Confound your dull brains!--Did you not enquire who liv'd there?\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes, Mr. Airy lives there.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What a strange circumstance!--You are sure Mr. Airy lives there.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Sure and sartin;--why I see the young lady you're a going to be\r\nmarried to, and I give her the trunk; for I think the sarvint said how Mr.\r\nFrankton lodg'd there.--I hope there's no harm done.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I hope so too;--I must step in, and see; but this is the last time\r\nI shall send you with a message.\r\n\r\n                                                           [_Goes in._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY.

Come, let's have no palitics, for gad's sake;--rat the\r\ncanstitution:--I wou'dn't give _une Fille de joye_, for all the musty\r\ncanstitutions in christendom.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. By the dignity of my profession, you never read Publius then; or\r\nyou would have liked _one_ constitution.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Publius! ha, ha, ha.--I read Publius! Not I, sir, I assure\r\nyou:--an _outré_ fellow,--a dull, mysterious, mechanical writer, as ever I\r\nrefused to read, split me.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. So he is, so he is, sir: by my body, I am glad to find _somebody_\r\nof my mind.\r\n\r\n               [_TRUEMAN and LOVEYET retire to the back of the stage._\r\n\r\n_Enter FRANKTON and HUMPHRY._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. You saw him go into Miss Airy's house, this morning, you say.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. Yes.                  [_Walks thoughtlessly about the stage._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. I think, this is a tolerable confirmation of the matter.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Hah,--Frankton;--'foregad, I am yours, superlatively.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Are you, positively? Hah,--she is here. [_Enter MARIA, on the\r\nopposite side._] Your humble servant, Miss Airy.\r\n\r\nMARIA. [_Pretends to take no notice of FRANKTON._] Mr. Trueman, I hope I\r\nhave the pleasure to see you well.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I thank you, madam. [_Resumes his discourse with LOVEYET, who does\r\nnot yet observe MARIA._]\r\n\r\nMARIA. I hoped to have found Miss Harriet here, sir.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Madam?--                           [_Turns to LOVEYET again._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Therefore, sir, as I was telling you, I am determined to have\r\nher.                                                    [_To TRUEMAN._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. [_Leaving LOVEYET._] How is this, madam?--Mr. Loveyet tells me, he\r\nis determined to have you.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Who! How!--Have who, sir?             [_Loud and earnestly._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. [_Seeing MARIA._] By my body, there she is herself.--Have who,\r\nsir?--Why, have this lady, sir; who do you think?--My sweet Miss Airy, I\r\nhave the transcendent pleasure to kiss your hand, ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nMARIA. Oh, fie, Mr. Loveyet.--I will have the pleasure to tease\r\nFrankton, now. [_Retires with OLD LOVEYET, whispering, and looking\r\ntenderly at him._]\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Amazement!--The _old_ fellow!                      [_Aside._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. This is all very astanishing, 'foregad:--demme, but she\r\ndeserves to die an old maid, if she has _him_.               [_Aside._\r\n\r\nMARIA. [_Pretends to observe FRANKTON, for the first time._]--Mr.\r\nFrankton!--I did not observe you before: I give you joy of your friend's\r\narrival, sir;--I suppose you have seen him;--he is very agreeable.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Then I need not ask you, if you have seen him, madam.\r\n\r\nMARIA. He was at my house not two hours ago.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Did not you see him before that, madam?\r\n\r\nMARIA. I did not, sir.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Detested falsehood!                                [_Aside._\r\n\r\nMARIA. The old gentleman acquainted me of his arrival, only a few minutes\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Eigh, how,--old gentleman!--she did not mean me, I hope.\r\n                                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. And you think Mr. Loveyet is so agreeable then.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Aye, that's me;--by my body, he is jealous of me. Ha, ha; poor\r\nyoung fool!                                                  [_Aside._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. He thinks very highly of _you_, I assure you, madam; he speaks of\r\nyou with admiration.\r\n\r\nMARIA. And what of that, sir?--You speak as if you thought\r\nhim my _only_ admirer.                                  [_Affectedly._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Disgusting vanity! [_Aside._]--No, madam,--the number of your\r\nadmirers is at least equal to that of your acquaintance;--but there is only\r\none, who sincerely _loves_, as well as admires you.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Come, come, sir; none of your airs, sir:--_love_ her\r\nindeed;--why--why, she don't love _you_.\r\n                                     [_Ogling and winking at her, &c._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Ha, ha, gudgeons all, demme;--old square toes is cursedly\r\nbit; I see that.                                             [_Aside._\r\n\r\nMARIA. Mr. Loveyet, I return'd the trunk to your son.\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. His son.--Ha, ha.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Yes, yes, he told me so just now:--the poor dog was ready to jump\r\nout of his skin, when I told him he should have Harriet.\r\n\r\n_Enter CANTWELL and HERALD._\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Oh, the devil!--Now shall I be blown up, like a barrel of\r\ngun-powder.                                                  [_Aside._\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Servant, gentlemen and ladies.--How is your daughter, Mr.\r\nTrueman? I hope she is likely to do well.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I hope she is, madam; it is a match which we all approve.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. No, no, sir; I mean concerning her late affair.\r\n\r\nHERALD. Why, young Loveyet certainly would not stoop so low, as to have her\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. 'Zounds! Why not, pray?\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What, in the name of ill luck, can they mean!--I hope, I--oh,\r\nthere they come.\r\n\r\n_Enter HARRIET and CHARLES LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Oh, dear, here they are;--why she don't look as if that was\r\nthe case.                                                [_To HERALD._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. I desire, ladies, to know what you mean, by these mysterious\r\nwhispers.\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. La! sir; you only want to put a body to the blush; but if you\r\nwant an explanation, that gentleman [_Pointing to WORTHNOUGHT._] can give\r\nit to you.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. The villain! [_Aside._]--I fancy _I_ could explain it as well.\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Hem, hem,--now comes on my trial.               [_Aside._\r\n\r\nCHARLES. But first,--your blessing, sir.      [_Kneels to his father._\r\n\r\nHARRIET. And yours, sir.                         [_Kneels to TRUEMAN._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. What,--married already!\r\n\r\nCHARLES. This ten minutes, sir.                             [_Rising._\r\n\r\nCANTWELL }\r\n  AND    } Married!\r\nHERALD   }\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Then my ill-star'd fortune is decided.          [_Aside._\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Upon my erudition, you have been too precipitate, Harriet; but\r\nI have no reason to think, you will repent it; you, therefore, have my\r\nsincerest benediction.                                 [_Raising her._\r\n\r\nMARIA. I give you joy, my dear.                         [_To HARRIET._\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. Now all my fears have vanished.\r\n                                  [_Aside, and goes to YOUNG LOVEYET._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By my body, you have made quick work of it, Charles.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. For fear of the worst, I have.                      [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. But--but are you in favour of the new Constitution yet?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. At present I can think of no Constitution but that of Love and\r\nMatrimony, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. And I shall be sorry if your matrimonial Constitution does not\r\nprove the better one of the two.--Eigh, Maria?\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Dick Worthnought, esquire, thou art an ass and a liar; and,\r\nwhat is worse than both,--as poor as poverty. Oh, Fortune, thou blind\r\ndisposer of human events, when wilt thou make a man of me?\r\n\r\n                                                     [_Going angrily._\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Stay a little, if you please, sir.--My happiness is too great at\r\npresent, to let me take that revenge, which the baseness of your conduct\r\ndeserves: but justice bids me accuse you of having wickedly, and without\r\ncause, endeavoured to injure the reputation of this lady, whom it is my\r\nhighest boast and felicity now to call my wife; my making her such,\r\nhowever, at the very time when the baneful tongue of Slander is so diligent\r\nto damn her spotless fame,--[_Looking significantly at CANTWELL and\r\nHERALD._]--will at once convince the public of her innocence, and the\r\ncruelty of her enemies. With her, you have also injured her connexions; but\r\nI, for my own part, am fully satisfied with those symptoms of shame and\r\nrepentance, which you now evince.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. Upon my education, I did not think him susceptible of either.--A\r\nfew minutes ago, I received this audacious epistle from him.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, I have the honour to--acquaint you--that I have an inclination--to\r\nmarry your daughter,--notwithstanding--the late scandalous--reports that\r\nare transpiring to her disadvantage, and (what is still worse)\r\nthe--comparative meanness--of her fortune to mine.\"--The comparative\r\nmeanness of her fortune to mine.\r\n\r\nHARRIET, }\r\nMARIA,   }\r\nLOVEYET, } Ha, ha, ha.\r\nCHARLES, }\r\nFRANKTON,}\r\n\r\nWORTHNOUGHT. Never was put so much to my trumps, 'foregad.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Exit._\r\n\r\nHERALD. Unmannerly wretches!                  [_Scornfully, and exit._\r\n\r\nCANTWELL. Oh, the wickedness of this wicked world!  [_Exit after her._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Why, this is just as it should be now;--I think business goes on\r\nfinely.\r\n\r\nMARIA. You will not think so, much longer.                   [_Aside._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. By my body, I am as merry as a cricket;--an't you,\r\nMaria? For my part, I feel so well pleased, I could find in my\r\nheart to--to do as you have done;--[_To CHARLES._] cou'dn't you,\r\nmy love?                                                  [_To MARIA._\r\n\r\nMARIA. Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Oh, you dear little rogue! With whom, eigh, with whom?--Don't\r\nbe bashful,--tell them.--I know she means me.                [_Aside._\r\n\r\nMARIA. I beg to be excused from telling that, sir; but I will tell you who\r\nit is I would _not_ have.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Aye, that's him.--[_Aside, looking at FRANKTON._]--Well, who is it\r\nyou won't have, Maria, who is it?\r\n\r\nMARIA. You, sir.                                      [_Emphatically._\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Me, eigh?--me--me, Maria?\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Preposterous infatuation!\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. D----'d, wanton, treacherous jilt!\r\n                                           [_Walks about discomposed._\r\n\r\nMARIA. You have jilted yourself, sir;--nothing but excess of dotage and\r\nself-conceit could have let you impose on yourself in such a manner.\r\n\r\nFRANKTON. And may I then hope--\r\n\r\nMARIA. Hope?--Oh, yes, sir;--you have my permission to _hope_ for anything\r\nyou please.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. And you, madam, the disposition to gratify his hopes, I fancy.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. I fancy you lie, sir; and you sha'n't have Harriet, for your\r\nimpertinence.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. Excuse me, father;--it is not in your power to prevent that;--the\r\nhappy deed is already executed.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. 'Zounds! that's true!--and, what is still worse, the other deed is\r\nexecuted too.--Fire and fury! All is lost, for the sake of that inveigling,\r\nperfidious young Syren. Ugh, ugh, ugh.\r\n\r\nTRUEMAN. [_Burlesquing what LOVEYET has said in a former scene._] \"'Sdeath,\r\nsir! I tell you I am but two and forty years old: she sha'n't be more than\r\nthirty odd, sir; and she shall be ten years younger than I am too.--A man\r\nof five and forty, old, forsooth!\" Ha, ha, ha.\r\n\r\nLOVEYET. Perdition! Is this what I have come to at last?--Despis'd,--\r\nbetray'd,--laugh'd at,--supplanted by a puppy,--[_Pointing to FRANKTON_]--\r\ntrick'd out of my money by a graceless, aristocratic son,--I--I'll--I'll\r\ngo hang myself.\r\n\r\n                                                 [_Exit in a passion._\r\n\r\nHUMPHRY. This is, for all the world, like the show I see t'other night, at\r\nthe Play-house.\r\n\r\nCHARLES. His agitation of mind distresses me: my happiness is not complete,\r\nwhile it is enjoyed at the expense of a father's:--painful reflection!--We\r\nwill go immediately, Harriet, and endeavour to pacify him.\r\n\r\n    _His conduct shall instruct the hoary Sage,\r\n    That youth and beauty were not meant for age;\r\n    His rage, resentment, av'rice, dotage, pride,\r\n    (Sad view of human nature's frailest side!)\r\n    Shall mend us all;--but chiefly I shall prove,\r\n    That all his Politics, can never match my LOVE._\r\n\r\n_The End._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBERS' NOTES:\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral: Variable hyphenation of mack(-)marony and to(-)day as in original.\r\nPage 353: Politican corrected to Politician.\r\nFootnote 2: Geneological as in original text (twice).",
